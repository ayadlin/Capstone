although it is not detectable in normal tissues (4, 6–9). These
observations strongly emphasize the importance of monomeric
Ln-g2 as a specific marker for invasive carcinomas.
In addition, monomeric Ln-g2 may also play an important role
as a modulator of tumor cell behavior. Ln-g2 has an epidermal
growth factor (EGF)-like repeat in domain III (DIII) and this
portion can be clipped out from Ln-g2 by the action of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP), such as MMP-2 and membrane type
1-MMP (MT1-MMP; refs. 10, 11). The released DIII fragment can
act as a ligand of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and elicit receptormediated intracellular signals (12). Interestingly, the monomeric
form of Ln-g2 shows 10-fold higher sensitivity to MT1-MMP than
the g2 chain in human Ln-5 (13). Thus, the monomeric form of
Ln-g2 expressed in human tumors may contribute to tumor cell
behavior by activating EGFR. Indeed, aggressive melanoma Mum2B
cells that express monomeric Ln-g2 and MT1-MMP can form a
tube-like network known as vascular mimicry when the cells
are cultured in collagen gel. Knockdown of MT1-MMP expression
by small interfering RNA or inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity
of EGFR suppressed the tube formation (14). In spite of the
importance of monomeric Ln-g2 as a marker in tumors and as a
tumor cell regulator, we do not have simple methods to detect it
directly and sensitively because all the available antibodies against
Ln-g2 also react with Ln-5. Thus, the presence of monomeric Ln-g2
can only be inferred by confirming the lack of Ln-a3 and Ln-h3.
In this study, we tried to develop a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
that reacts selectively with the monomeric form of Ln-g2. For this
purpose, mice were immunized with purified monomeric human
Ln-g2 and antibodies produced by hybridoma clones were
screened by ELISA using monomeric Ln-g2 and Ln-5. Most of the
hybridoma supernatants that recognized the monomer also
recognized Ln-5, with the exception of one (mAb 1H3) that reacted
preferentially with monomeric Ln-g2. We evaluated this antibody
as a practical tool to monitor monomeric Ln-g2 in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract
Laminin-5 (Ln-5), a heterotrimer composed of three different
laminin chains [laminin-A3 (Ln-A3), laminin-B3 (Ln-B3),
and laminin-;2 (Ln-;2)], is a major component of the
basement membrane in most adult tissues. One of the chains,
Ln-;2, is a specific marker of invasive tumors because it is
frequently expressed as a monomer in malignant tumors.
However, there is no simple and direct method to detect the
monomeric form of Ln-;2 selectively in the presence of Ln-5
because all available antibodies recognize both monomeric
and heterotrimeric forms of Ln-;2. In this study, we developed
a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) termed 1H3 that reacts
specifically with human Ln-;2 monomers during immunoprecipitation, ELISA, Western blotting, and immunostaining.
Ln-5 was not recognized by mAb 1H3 after denaturation with
detergents under nonreducing conditions, but reactivity was
recovered when denaturation was done under reducing
conditions. The epitope of the antibody was mapped to region
on the coiled-coil structure formed between Ln-;2 and its
partner chains Ln-A3 and Ln-B3 in Ln-5, whose structure is
further stabilized by disulfide bonds. In normal tissue samples,
the basement membrane was stained with conventional
antibody against Ln-;2 but not by mAb 1H3. In contrast,
tumor cells in tissue sections could be stained with mAb 1H3 as
efficiently as with conventional antibody. Thus, mAb 1H3 holds
promise as a powerful tracking tool for the specific detection
of monomeric Ln-;2 in vivo and in vitro and is potentially
useful as a diagnostic tool for detecting tumors and as a vehicle
for drug delivery to cancer tissues. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):530–6]

Introduction
Laminins are assembled from three polypeptide chains designated a, h, and g. There are several isoforms of each type of chain
that associate in different combinations to constitute the burgeoning laminin protein family (1). For example, laminin-5 (Ln-5), the
most abundant form of most of the basement membrane in adult
tissues, contains laminin-a3 (Ln-a3), laminin-h3 (Ln-h3), and
laminin-g2 (Ln-g2) chains as illustrated in Fig. 1A (2, 3). Among
these polypeptide chains, Ln-g2 has been found to be frequently
expressed as a monomer in several types of malignant cancer cells
based on experiments showing the lack of simultaneous expression
of Ln-a3 and Ln-h3 chains (4, 5). Expression of monomeric Ln-g2
is particularly predominant in the budding cells of tumor masses as
observed in esophageal, stomach, colon, and cervical carcinomas,

Materials and Methods
Preparation of human Ln-;2 protein. Human Ln-5 and monomeric
Ln-g2 proteins were purified from culture medium of human gastric
carcinoma STKM-1 and malignant melanoma Mum2B cells, respectively,
as described previously (13).
Construction and expression of DIII, DIII/V, and DI/II. The cDNA of
human Ln-g2 was used as a template to generate DNA fragments encoding
DI/II (nucleotides 1830–3580), DIII (nucleotides 1303–1737), and DIII/V
(nucleotides 1–1820) by PCR. These PCR products were subcloned into the
pcDNA3.1+ expression vector (Invitrogen), and their nucleotide sequences
were confirmed. For transient expression of the encoded proteins, each
expression plasmid (4 Ag) was transfected into COS7 cells (100 mm dish)
using Fugene 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and cells were cultured for 48 h in
serum-free DMEM after 12 h of transfection. Conditioned medium was
collected and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Precipitates containing recombinant proteins were collected and dissolved in
20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/0.15 mol/L NaCl/0.005% Brij-35 buffer.

processing sites (ps ) in Ln-g2 (ps1 and ps2 ). B, specific reactivity of mAb 1H3
(top ) and D4B5 (bottom ) to monomeric Ln-g2 and Ln-5 was analyzed by
sandwich ELISA using 96-well plates. Each antibody was coated onto the 96-well
plates and antigens were added to the well at the indicated doses. The
captured antigens were measured as described in Materials and Methods.

Immunization, hybridization, and hybridoma screening. BALB/c
mice were injected i.p. with 50 Ag of human monomeric Ln-g2 protein
emulsified in an equal volume of complete Freund’s adjuvant (Difco
Diagnostic Systems) and boosted twice at 2-week intervals with equal
amount of monomeric Ln-g2 protein with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant
(Difco Diagnostic Systems). Six weeks after the third immunization, the
mice were injected i.v. with the same amount of Ln-g2 protein without
adjuvant. After 3 days of i.v. injection, the blood was collected and
centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at room temperature and serum was collected as a
positive control of antibody to monomeric Ln-g2 protein during hybridoma
screening.

Hybridization of the mouse myeloma line (P3U1) and spleen cells was
performed by the methods at Kitayama Labes Co. Ltd. Hybridoma cells
were cultured in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selection medium
for 10 days and the cells were reseeded into 96-well plates. Supernatants
from each well having growing cells were examined for antibody production
using purified monomeric Ln-g2 and Ln-5 by a single ELISA assay. Limited
dilution and cloning of cells were repeated twice and some hybridomas
producing mAb reactive to monomeric Ln-g2 were obtained.
Western blot analysis. Purified monomeric Ln-g2 (1 Ag) and Ln-5 (3 Ag)
proteins were separated on a 6% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.45 Am;
Millipore) for 1.5 h. The membranes were incubated in PBS and 0.05%
Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4jC to block nonspecific binding and then probed with the antibodies. To detect the antibody bound to the antigen, the membranes were treated with secondary
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Peroxidase activity
was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence plus detection system
(GE Healthcare; ref. 13).
Immunoprecipitation of Ln-;2 with 1H3 antibody. Purified monomeric Ln-g2 and Ln-5 proteins (1 Ag each) were incubated overnight at 4jC
with mAbs 1H3 and 2H2 in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/0.005% Briji-35/1%
CHAPS (TBC) buffer ( final volume, 200 AL). Suspended protein G-Sepharose
(40 AL) was added and incubated at 4jC for 3 h with agitation. Protein
G-Sepharose was washed thrice with TBC buffer and then centrifuged at
15,000 rpm to precipitate the antigen/antibody complexes. Finally,
precipitated antigen-antibody complex was released from the protein
G-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) by addition of 2 SDS sample buffer/5%
h-2-mercaptoethanol buffer (15).
Single and sandwich ELISA assays. Screening of antibodies produced
by hybridoma cells was carried out by single ELISA. Ninety-six–well plates
(Corning Costar) were directly coated with either purified monomeric Ln-g2
(0.5 Ag/mL) or Ln-5 (1 Ag/mL) in PBS for 3 h at room temperature. The
wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing with PBS thrice, serum-free culture media of
hybridomas were added to the wells and allowed to react with each antigen
for 1 h at room temperature. Then, each well was washed with PBS/0.05%
Tween 20 thrice and bound antibodies were detected by using HRPconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare). The absorbance of the
tetramethyl benzidine–filled (Sigma) wells was determined at 450 nm with a
Bio-Rad spectrophotometer.
For quantitative analysis, 96-well plates were coated with mAb D4B5
(1 Ag/mL) or mAb 1H3 (10 Ag/mL) in PBS overnight at 4jC. Preimmune
mouse serum was also coated as a negative control. Blocking and washing
of the wells were carried out similarly to the methods described above.
Then, increasing doses of purified Ln-5 or monomeric Ln-g2 (0–240 ng/mL)
were added to the wells and allowed to react with each antibody for 1 h at
room temperature. After washing, bound antigens were detected with
polyclonal antibody (pAb) 2778 (0.5 Ag/mL) and goat anti-mouse IgG
conjugated to HRP. The absorbance (450 nm) of the tetramethyl benzidine–
filled wells was measured with a Bio-Rad spectrophotometer.

skin carcinoma A431, breast carcinomas MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and lung
carcinoma PC-8 cell lines were provided by Human Science Research
Resources Bank. The cell lines were cultured at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. DMEM for Mum2B, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7,
A431, and PC-8 cell lines and RPMI 1640 (Sigma) for SKOV-3, MKN7,
MKN28, TMK-1, and STKM-1 cell lines were supplemented with 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 1.2 mg/mL NaHCO3, and 2 mmol/L glutamate and used as basal
medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific).

20 min at 4jC and the supernatant was collected as a clear lysate. The
protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad Dye binding kit. BSA
was used as the protein standard.
Human colon carcinoma tissues. Human colon adenocarcinoma and
normal colon epithelial tissues were surgically obtained from Fukuoka
University Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan). Frozen samples of these tissues were
sliced to a thickness of 4 Am on glass slides. Proteins were then extracted by
adding 75 AL of lysis buffer to the glass slide (total tissue lysate). The cell
lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4jC, and the supernatant
was collected. The protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad Dye
binding kit. BSA was used as the protein standard.
Immunohistochemistry. Frozen colon carcinoma and normal colon
epithelial tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min.
Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2 in methanol for
30 min. Tissue sections (4 Am) were treated mildly with protease XXIV for
1 min in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the enzymatic reaction
was stopped by washing thrice with PBS. Blocking was performed using
the Histofine blocking kit (Nichirei Biosciences, Inc.) for 30 min. Samples
were treated with either mAb 1H3 (10 Ag/mL), D4B5 (5 Ag/mL), or IgG
(10 Ag/mL) overnight at 4jC. After washing thrice with PBS, the sections
were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin as a
secondary antibody and then with HRP conjugated to streptavidin.
Peroxidase activity was detected by using a solution of diaminobenzidine
containing H2O2 in a Tris-HCl buffer, which develops a brown color in the
presence of peroxidase activity.

(data not shown). However, one clone (clone name: 1H3) produced
an IgG1 class of mAb that reacted preferentially with Ln-g2.
To confirm the reactivity and specificity of mAb 1H3 against
monomeric Ln-g2, the antibody was coated on assay plates and
incubated with different concentrations of Ln-g2 and Ln-5 as
antigen. Antigens captured by the plates were detected by using

Results
Specific detection of the monomeric form of Ln-;2 using a
mAb. The heterotrimeric structure of Ln-5 (left) and the domain
structure of Ln-g2 (right) are illustrated in Fig. 1A. Ln-g2 is
frequently processed by MMPs and major processed forms are also
indicated in Fig. 1A (right). Human malignant melanoma Mum2B
and human gastric carcinoma STKM-1 are representative cell lines
that express Ln-g2 as a monomer and as a heterotrimer (Ln-5),
respectively. Thus, these cell lines were used as sources of monomeric Ln-g2 and Ln-5, respectively ( for purified proteins, see
Fig. 3A).
Mice were immunized with monomeric Ln-g2 purified from
Mum2B cells and hybridoma clones were obtained. The mAbs
obtained were screened by performing single ELISA assays using
plates coated with either monomeric Ln-g2 or Ln-5. Most of the
mAbs that reacted with monomeric Ln-g2 also recognized Ln-5

Specific Detection of Monomeric Laminin-g2 Chain

and show that mAb 1H3 is selectively reactive with monomeric
Ln-g2.
Monomer-specific detection of LN-;2 by Western blot
analysis. We also tested whether mAb 1H3 displayed similar
selectivity toward monomeric Ln-g2 during Western blot analysis.
Both pAb 2778 and mAb 1H3 detected equally well monomeric
Ln-g2 containing intact (g2) and processed (g2’) forms as well
as Ln-5 g2 under conventional conditions of SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, which is done under reducing conditions (Fig. 3A).
Conversely, mAb 1H3 only recognized monomeric LN-g2 when
electrophoresis was done under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3B).
Ln-5 g2 was detected as a 450-kDa band by pAb 2778, reflecting
the fact that this is a complex of three polypeptide chains held
together by disulfide bonds (Fig. 1A, left). In contrast, pAb 2778
detected monomeric Ln-g2 as intact and processed forms as well
as a high molecular weight band of 400 kDa, which probably
corresponds to a Ln-g2 homotrimer complex (Fig. 3B, left).
However, mAb 1H3 did not recognize Ln-g2 in the 450-kDa Ln-5
complex, although it still reacted with monomeric Ln-g2 (Fig. 3B,
right). Taken together, these results further confirm the specificity
of mAb 1H3 for monomeric Ln-g2 and show that this antibody can
be used to specifically detect monomeric Ln-g2 during Western
blot analysis as long as electrophoresis is done under nonreducing
conditions. The specificity and conditions of the antibodies used
are summarized in Fig. 4D.

anti-Ln-g2 rabbit pAb (2778) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG. A negligible amount of Ln-5 was captured by mAb 1H3 even at
the highest dose (240 ng/mL) used, whereas monomeric Ln-g2 was
captured in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, top). Thus, mAb
1H3 preferentially recognizes the monomeric form of Ln-g2. We
also carried out similar experiments using a commonly used antihuman Ln-g2 mAb, D4B5. Although mAb D4B5 captured the
monomeric form of Ln-g2 efficiently, it also reacted with Ln-5
(Fig. 1B, bottom) as reported previously.
We also performed immunoprecipitation assays using mAb 1H3
and mAb 2H2, an antibody that recognized both monomeric Ln-g2
and Ln-5 during initial screening (data not shown). Purified
monomeric Ln-g2 and Ln-5 were immunoprecipitated with both
antibodies and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western
blotting using a pAb against Ln-g2 (2778). Both monomeric Ln-g2
and Ln-5 contained intact Ln-g2 together with some processed
forms of these proteins as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2A,
left; g2, g2’, and DIII/V, respectively). Although the intact form of
monomeric Ln-g2 was precipitated by both antibodies (Fig. 2A,
middle), certain processed forms detected by the pAb 2778 were
precipitated differentially by these two antibodies. This presumably
reflects differences in the distribution of the recognition sites for
these antibodies among the processed forms. In contrast, the Ln-g2
chain in Ln-5 was precipitated by mAb 2H2 but not by mAb 1H3
(Fig. 2, right). Thus, the results are consistent with the ELISA assays

DI/II fragment was not recognized by pAb 2778 but was detected
by pAb 1963 under both reducing and nonreducing conditions
(Fig. 4B). mAb 1H3 recognized only the DI/II fragment under both
reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4C). Thus, the epitope
recognized by mAb 1H3 is in domain I or II, which forms the
coiled-coil structure with the Ln-a3 and Ln-h3 chains and whose
stability depends on disulfide bond formation. Unsurprisingly, this
is the region of the ternary structure that is most severely occluded
by the presence of other laminin chains (a3 and h3) and by
disulfide bonds.
Use of mAb 1H3 for the detection of Ln-;2 in tumor cell
lines. Because mAb 1H3 selectively detects monomeric Ln-g2 even
by Western blotting, we used it to screen for the expression of
Ln-g2 in tumor cell lines. First, we tested Mum2B and STKM-1 cells
as controls. Ln-g2 was detected by mAb D4B5 in the extracts of both
of these cells under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5A, D4B5). Mum2B
cells predominantly expressed monomeric Ln-g2 (130-kDa band)
with undetectable levels of heterotrimeric Ln-5 g2 (450-kDa band)
expression. On the other hand, STKM-1 cells expressed heterotrimeric Ln-5 g2 with very little monomeric Ln-g2 expression.

The cognate site of mAb 1H3 is located within the
heterotrimeric coiled-coil region of Ln-5 ;2. The results of
the Western blot analysis showed that mAb 1H3 specificity was
retained after denaturation of the sample proteins with detergents
as long as the assays were carried out under nonreducing conditions. However, mAb 1H3 reacted with Ln-g2 released from the
Ln-5 complex under reducing conditions. This suggested that the
binding site of mAb 1H3 in Ln-g2 was masked in Ln-5, whose
structural stability depends on disulfide bond formation. To obtain
an explanation for why mAb 1H3 differentially interacts with Ln-5
g2 under reducing and nonreducing conditions, we performed
epitope mapping. Ln-g2 has five domains that are consecutively
numbered from its NH2 terminus as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Three
fragments containing different parts of Ln-g2 (DI/II, DIII, and
DIII/IV) were transiently expressed in COS7 cells as secreted
proteins and partially purified. DIII/IV and DIII fragments were
detected as 23- and 70-kDa bands, respectively, by Western blotting
using pAb 2778 under reducing conditions (Fig. 4A, Me+). Under
nonreducing conditions, both DIII and DIII/IV fragments were
detected as monomers and homo-oligomers (Fig. 4A, Me ). The

Specific Detection of Monomeric Laminin-g2 Chain

colon carcinoma patients (patients #1 and #2) and subjected to
Western blotting using mAbs 1H3 and D4B5 under nonreducing
conditions. In the cancer tissue lysates, multiple Ln-g2 bands
migrating between 110 and 140 kDa were detected by both mAbs
(Fig. 6A, 1H3 and D4B5). These bands presumably correspond to
differently processed or glycosylated forms of Ln-g2. In contrast,
the 450-kDa band corresponding to heterotrimeric Ln-5 g2 was
only detected in the normal tissue lysate with mAb D4B5 but
not with mAb 1H3 (Fig. 6A). This further confirms previous findings that monomeric Ln-g2 is predominantly expressed in cancer
tissues but not in normal epithelium.
Next, we used mAb 1H3 to immunostain frozen sections
obtained from normal and carcinoma tissues from patient #1.
The basement membranes of normal tissues were stained clearly
with mAb D4B5 but not with mAb 1H3 (Fig. 6B, 1–3). In contrast,
no basement membrane structure was observed in carcinoma
tissue stained with mAb D4B5 but carcinoma cells invading the
interstitial area were positively stained (Fig. 6B, 6 and 9). These
carcinoma cells were also positive for staining with mAb 1H3
(Fig. 6B, 5 and 8). Thus, mAb 1H3 has strong potential as a tracking
tool to detect the expression of monomeric Ln-g2 directly in situ.

Under the same assay conditions, mAb 1H3 detected the 130-kDa
band in the Mum2B cell lysate but failed to detect the 450-kDa band
in the STKM-1 cell extract (Fig. 5A, 1H3). Next, we extended the
assay to eight other carcinoma cell lines derived from gastric, breast,
skin, lung, and ovarian carcinomas. Both mAbs 1H3 and D4B5
detected monomeric Ln-g2 as a 130-kDa protein in six carcinoma
lines (TMK-1, MKN7, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, A431, and PC-8) but not
in MKN28 and SKOV-3 cell lines [Fig. 5B, D4B5 (top) and 1H3
(bottom)]. On the other hand, heterotrimeric Ln-5 g2 (450 kDa) was
detected only by mAb D4B5 in the MKN7 cell lysate (Fig. 5B, top).
Thus, monomeric Ln-g2 is expressed in a wide variety of carcinoma
cell lines and mAb 1H3 can be efficiently used to distinguish its presence. These results also show for the first time that Western blotting
under nonreducing conditions can be used to distinguish between
monomeric and heterotrimeric forms of Ln-g2 because they migrate
to different positions on the SDS-PAGE gel under these conditions.
Application of mAb 1H3 for the detection of Ln-;2 in human
cancer tissues. To further evaluate the usefulness of mAb 1H3 in
detecting monomeric Ln-g2 in clinical samples, we carried out
Western blot analysis on human colon cancer specimens. Tissue
lysate was prepared from 4-Am-sliced frozen tissues from two

Discussion

medium. Thus, the differences in the molecular weight of Ln-g2
between the two experiments are most likely due to differences in the
glycosylation status and proteolytic processing of Ln-g2.
Ln-g2 was detected in two clinical samples by Western blotting
under nonreducing conditions. Ln-5 g2 was detected only in normal tissues where the expression level of the monomeric form is very
low if not negligible (Fig. 6A, D4B5). In contrast, most of the Ln-g2
detected in colon carcinoma tissues was in the monomeric form
(Fig. 6A, 1H3). In addition, specificity of both antibodies (D4B5 and
1H3) was further confirmed even in immunostaining of the same
sample in situ (Fig. 6B). The basement membrane of the normal
tissue was stained with mAb D4B5 (Fig. 6B, 3) but not with mAb 1H3
(Fig. 6B, 2). This is because Ln-g2 in the basement membrane is
mostly part of the heterotrimer of 450 kDa as detected by Western
blotting. In contrast, basement membrane structure was not evident
in cancer tissue and the Ln-g2 signal was detected by mAb D4B5
mostly within cancer cells (Fig. 6B, 6 and 9). The Ln-g2 in these
carcinoma cells was also detectable by mAb 1H3, indicating that the
Ln-g2 signal detected by mAb D4B5 is in a monomeric state in these
cells (Fig. 6B, 5 and 8).
In summary, we developed a new mouse mAb that selectively
distinguishes between the monomeric form of Ln-g2 and Ln-g2 as
part of the heterotrimeric Ln-5 complex. According to our knowledge, this is the first monomer-specific anti-Ln-g2 antibody
described in the literature. Because of this specificity, we believe
it will be useful for the direct monitoring of monomeric Ln-g2
expression in vivo and in vitro. Because the expression of the
monomeric form of Ln-g2 seems to be a specific marker of malignant tumor cells (4, 16, 17), the mAb 1H3 could have potential as
a diagnostic tool for detecting invasive tumors in patients. In
addition, it may also be possible to use this antibody as a vehicle to
deliver antitumor agents to the vicinity of invasive tumors.

We developed a new mAb (1H3) that preferentially recognizes
monomeric Ln-g2. The specificity of mAb 1H3 for monomeric
Ln-g2 is sufficient for the selective detection of monomeric Ln-g2,
even in the presence of Ln-5 g2, by various immunologic detection
methods, such as ELISA, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting,
and immunohistochemistry.
The specificity of mAb 1H3 for monomeric Ln-g2 most likely
depends on the masking of its recognition site in Ln-5. Indeed, the
epitope was mapped to domains I and II (Fig. 4), which are known
to form a coiled-coil structure with the Ln-a3 and Ln-h3 chains.
Thus, the epitope coincides with a region that, structurally speaking, is likely to be occluded in the presence of the other laminin
chains of Ln-5. In addition, the stabilization of this region by multiple disulfide bonds may explain why mAb 1H3 does not react with
Ln-5 even after it has been denatured and subjected to Western
blot analysis under nonreducing conditions.
In parallel with the characterization of mAb 1H3, we also showed
that expression of monomeric Ln-g2 can be easily distinguished
from that of Ln-5 g2 by Western blotting under nonreducing conditions, even with commonly available antibodies. Under these conditions, Ln-5 g2 can be detected as a 450-kDa protein cross-linked to
other laminin chains via disulfide bonds, whereas non–cross-linked
monomeric Ln-g2 can be readily detected as a 130-kDa band. Thus,
Western blotting under nonreducing conditions is the easiest way to
detect monomeric Ln-g2 with conventional antibodies, such as mAb
D4B5. By using this method, we analyzed 10 carcinoma cell lines for
Ln-g2 expression (Fig. 5A and B). The expression patterns of these
carcinoma cells are summarized in Fig. 5C. Eight of 10 cell lines
expressed Ln-g2. Six of the eight positive cell lines predominantly expressed Ln-g2 in monomeric form (melanoma, lung, gastric, breast,
skin, and ovarian cancers), whereas the other two expressed it predominantly as the Ln-5 heterotrimer (gastric carcinoma cell lines).
These results corroborate previous reports claiming that malignant
carcinoma cells frequently express Ln-g2 in monomeric form, which
were solely based on experiments showing the lack of Ln-a3 and
Ln-h3 expression in carcinoma cells. Monomeric Ln-g2 showed a
single band of 130 kDa in the positive cell lines (Fig. 5A and B),
whereas those detected in Fig. 4 under nonreducing conditions were
130 and 170 kDa in size. The Ln-g2 detected in Fig. 5 presumably
represents the proteins before secretion, whereas those detected in
Fig. 3 correspond to secreted proteins purified from the conditioned

Correction: Development of a New Tracking
Tool for the Human Monomeric Laminin-g2
Chain In Vitro and In Vivo
In this article (Cancer Res 2008;68:530–6), which appeared in the January 15, 2008
issue of Cancer Research (1), the authors characterized two monoclonal antibodies
(1H3 and 2H2); the 1H3 antibody recognized the human monomeric laminin-g2
(Ln-g2 mono, LAMC2) preferentially over the laminin-g2 in heterotrimeric laminin5 (Ln-5g2). The results using the 1H3 antibody are the basis for the conclusion of
the study. Although there is no change in the characterization of 1H3 antibody, the
authors observed slightly different results with the newly recloned 2H2 antibody
from the hybridoma cells used in the study.
In Fig. 2, the 2H2 antibody exhibited a partial reactivity to Ln-5g2, although it reacted
with Ln-g2 mono. On the basis of these results, the authors concluded that the 2H2
antibody recognizes both Ln-g2 mono and Ln-5g2 and summarized the results in
Fig. 4D.
However, the authors' recent follow-up study of the 2H2 antibody revealed that this
antibody, like the 1H3 antibody, also preferentially recognizes Ln-g2 mono over Ln5g2 (see corrected Figs. 2 and 4D below). This change in reactivity occurred during
recloning of the original hybridoma cells. The authors found that the IgM-producing
clone was contaminated with the original hybridoma cells producing the 2H2
antibody. The reactivity of recloned 2H2 antibody to Ln-5g2 was negligible, whereas
reactivity to Ln-g2 mono remained (see corrected Figs. 2 and 4D below).
