Abstract
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths with current chemotherapies lacking adequate
specificity and efficacy. β-Lapachone (β-lap) is a novel anticancer drug that is bioactivated by NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase 1, an enzyme found specifically overexpressed in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein,
we report a nanotherapeutic strategy that targets NSCLC tumors in two ways: (a) pharmacodynamically
through the use of a bioactivatable agent, β-lap, and (b) pharmacokinetically by using a biocompatible nanocarrier, polymeric micelles, to achieve drug stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. β-Lap micelles
produced by a film sonication technique were small (∼30 nm), displayed core-shell architecture, and possessed
favorable release kinetics. Pharmacokinetic analyses in mice bearing subcutaneous A549 lung tumors showed
prolonged blood circulation (t1/2, ∼28 h) and increased accumulation in tumors. Antitumor efficacy analyses in
mice bearing subcutaneous A549 lung tumors and orthotopic Lewis lung carcinoma models showed significant
tumor growth delay and increased survival. In summary, we have established a clinically viable β-lap nanomedicine platform with enhanced safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor efficacy for the specific treatment
of NSCLC tumors. Cancer Res; 70(10); 3896–904. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer currently accounts for ∼30% of cancer-related
deaths in both males and females in the United States (1). A
current trend in cancer chemotherapy involves the identification of exploitable molecular targets unique to cancer cells for
tumor-specific drug therapy. β-Lapachone (β-lap) is a novel
anticancer agent whose mechanism of action is highly dependent on the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
1 (NQO1), a flavoprotein found overexpressed in non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 2). In cells overexpressing
NQO1, β-lap undergoes a futile cycle resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (3). These ROS cause DNA
single-strand breaks, hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose)

polymerase-1 (PARP-1; ref. 4), loss of NAD+ and ATP pools,
and a unique pattern of cell death referred to as “programmed
necrosis” or “necroptosis” (Fig. 1; ref. 5). Necroptosis is a
unique form of cell death that has attributes from both apoptosis (e.g., terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling positive and chromatin and nuclear
condensation) and necrosis (e.g., caspase and energy independent). Cell death occurs specifically in tumor tissues overexpressing NQO1, whereas normal tissues and organs with
endogenous low levels of the enzyme are spared. This antitumor mechanism was shown to be effective in breast (6), prostate (7), and NSCLC cells (4). Although promising, the poor
water solubility (0.038 mg/mL) and nonspecific drug distribution of β-lap limit its clinical potential. Early attempts at
formulating β-lap for the clinics focused on complexation
with cyclodextrins such as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
(HPβ-CD). The resulting formulation, β-lap·HPβ-CD (i.e.,
ARQ501), showed a 400-fold increase in solubility (8) but
underwent unsuccessful clinical trials in a variety of cancers
(9–12). The reason for failure includes dose-limiting toxicity
in the form of hemolytic anemia and nonspecific drug
distribution, resulting in poor antitumor efficacy.
Currently, nanomedicine, or the use of nanoscale (1–100 nm)
constructs for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, represents an innovative trend in cancer care (13, 14). Advancements in nanomaterials and nanotechnology have paved
the way for several carriers such as liposomes (15), dendrimers (16), and micelles (17, 18). Polymeric micelles, or
nanosized (∼10–100 nm) supramolecular constructs composed of amphiphilic block copolymers, are emerging as
powerful drug delivery vehicles for hydrophobic drugs.

β-Lapachone Nanotherapeutics for NSCLC

Figure 1. Proposed dual targeting
mechanism by β-lap nanotherapeutics.
Depicted is a simplified model that
summarizes the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic targeting strategy
provided by β-lap micelles. A, polymer
micelles provide long circulation and reduced
drug clearance that enhances accumulation
in tumor tissue, wherein micelles are
internalized into cells and drug is released.
B, tumor cell killing is accomplished through
the NQO1-dependent mechanism of action
of β-lap, a unique pattern of cell death
referred to as programmed necrosis or
necroptosis.

Advantages afforded for drug delivery include the presence of
an inner core for lipophilic drug entrapment, as well as a
hydrophilic outer shell that prevents particle aggregation
and opsonization (19). This hinders uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES; ref. 20), bestowing them with long
circulation times that, combined with their small size, aid
in preferential accumulation in tumor tissue through the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Fig. 1;
refs. 21, 22). These benefits for site-specific drug delivery will
facilitate clinical translation of traditional and emerging
chemotherapeutic agents with immense cell killing potential

but that are otherwise abandoned due to insolubility and
toxicity.
In this report, we describe the implementation of polymeric
micelles to generate a clinically viable formulation of β-lap as
a safe and efficacious nanotherapeutic platform for the treatment of NSCLCs. We hypothesized that β-lap micelles would
provide a synergistic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
targeting of NQO1-overexpressing lung tumors (Fig. 1). By using a highly efficient vehicle that ensures tumor accumulation,
as well as a cancer-specific agent for NSCLC, a novel treatment strategy may arise that can help combat the disease.

Materials and Methods
Materials. HPβ-CD was obtained from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc. with >98% purity. β-Lap was synthesized as described (23). PEG5k-PLA5k block copolymer
(molecular weight = 10,000 Da) was synthesized by a ringopening polymerization procedure (24). All organic solvents
were analytical grade. β-Lap·HPβ-CD was formulated using a
previously published procedure (8). β-Lap micelles were
fabricated as described (25). PBS (pH 7.4) was purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Mouse LLC lung cancer cells were grown
in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37°C
in a humidified incubator in a 5% CO2–95% air atmosphere.
The A549 and LLC cells were infected with a lentivirus construct that contained the luciferase gene with a cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells were Mycoplasma-free.
Preparation of β-lap·HPβ-CD complex and β-lap
micelles. β-Lap·HPβ-CD complexes were prepared as
described (8), filtered by 0.2-μm nylon filtration, and the
concentration of β-lap was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy [λmax = 257 nm, ε = 105 mL/(cm·mg β-lap)].
A film sonication method was used to produce β-lap
micelles (25). Briefly, β-lap and poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly
(D,L-lactic acid) (PEG-PLA [5%, w/w]) were dissolved in acetone and the organic solvent was allowed to evaporate, yielding a solid film. Water was then added and the solution was
sonicated for 5 minutes. Drug-loaded polymer micelles were
filtered through 0.45-μm nylon filters to remove nonencapsulated drug aggregates, and the micelle solution was stored immediately at 4°C to prevent premature drug release. The
solution of micelles was then concentrated by centrifugation
(3,000 rpm, 4°C) using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters (molecular weight cutoff = 100 kDa). β-Lap concentration was then
determined by lyophilizing a known volume of solution that
was redissolved in chloroform and analyzed by UV-Vis as
described above.
For radiolabeled polymers used in pharmacokinetic studies, a small amount of MeO-PEG-PLA-OCOC3H3 (1%, w/w)
was dissolved with PEG-PLA, and β-lap micelles were prepared in a similar method as described above.
Pharmacokinetic analyses of β-lap micelles. All animal
procedures adhered to NIH guidelines, following approved
protocols by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas. Experiments involving radioactive materials were approved by the Radiation Safety Committee. Pharmacokinetic
studies determining blood concentration over time, as well as
tissue of distribution of β-lap micelles, were performed in 6- to
8-week-old randomized tumor-bearing female athymic nude
mice (∼25 g each). Log-phase A549 cells (5 × 106) were injected
s.c. into the flanks of mice. Tumor sizes were regularly measured using calipers, and volumes were calculated using the
following formula: volume (mm3) = length × width × width/
2. Pharmacokinetic studies were initiated with randomized
mice containing average tumor volumes of ∼300 mm3.
β-Lap micelles containing 1% 3H-labeled PEG-PLA were
injected into mice via the tail vein. Blood was collected from

3898

Cancer Res; 70(10) May 15, 2010

the ocular vein at various times (1 min to 24 h) after injection. Plasma was isolated and mixed with a tissue solubilizer
(1 mL, BTS-450; Beckman) at room temperature for 5 hours
followed by addition of liquid scintillation mixture (10 mL),
and the mixture was incubated for 12 hours. Biodistribution
studies of β-lap micelles in tissues and organs were conducted at various times from 0 to 24 hours. Animals were
sacrificed, and organs were harvested, weighed, and resuspended in deionized water. Tissues were subsequently
homogenized by adding tissue solubilizer (1 mL), 30%
H2O2, liquid scintillation mixture, and acetic acid. Radioactive isotope quantities in samples were monitored using
a predetermined calibration curve on a Beckman LS 6000
IC liquid scintillation counter. Results were presented as
percentage (%) initial dose per gram tissue. All experiments
were performed in triplicate, and data were analyzed using a
two-compartment pharmacokinetic model (26).
Treatment of subcutaneous A549 lung tumors in mice.
A549 xenografts in 6- to 8-week-old female athymic nude
mice were prepared as described above. Animals bearing
∼200 mm3 tumors were randomized and used to examine
the antitumor efficacy of β-lap·HPβ-CD complexes versus
β-lap micelles. Both formulations were i.v. administered to
mice (n = 5) every other day for 9 days at doses ranging from
30 to 50 mg/kg. Tumor sizes were measured as described
above. At day 30, tumor-bearing mice were imaged using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) for purposes of tumor size comparison. For BLI, animals were placed under anesthesia using
isoflurane, and 2.5 mg D-luciferin was s.c. administered. BLI
images of mice were captured using a Xenogen Vivovision
IVIS Lumina Imager for 30 seconds. For long-term survival
studies, animals were sacrificed when tumor volumes
reached 1,500 mm3.
β-Lap efficacy studies using tail vein–induced orthotopic
LLC tumors in athymic nude mice. Female athymic mice
(∼25 g) were injected i.v. with 0.5 × 106 LLC cells via tail vein.
It was found by BLI that the injected cells transplanted to the
intended site of the lungs to establish the orthotopic lung
tumor model. Mice were randomized into two groups (n = 8)
for β-lap micelle or control (blank) micelle treatments. Mice
were monitored every other day using BLI for tumor growth.
Relative light intensity units (from 7.5 × 104 to 3.0 × 105) were
used as a marker for tumor initiation in the lungs. Day 0 was
designated as initial detection of disease and the day before
start of treatment. Animals were treated with 40 mg/kg β-lap
micelles administered i.v. via tail vein and repeated five times
every other day over 9 days. Animals were monitored daily
for survival. In a separate study, mice (n = 3) were administered β-lap micelles or control micelles, and animals were
sacrificed at day 9 to examine disease progression via gross
inspection and detailed histologic evaluation. Lungs were
fixed in 10% formalin overnight and embedded by the Histology Core (Departments of Pathology and Molecular Pathology,
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). H&E
staining was performed on paraffin-embedded 5-μm tissue
sections. Whole-mount images of sections were imaged using
a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope. Single images at ×50
(total magnification) were compiled using the Leica Application

Suite computer program to create the final whole-mount
image. Total lung area and tumor area were calculated using
ImageJ software (NIH).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses of survival data
and lung tumor areas were performed using GraphPad Prism
software. All statistical analyses were two-sided. In the subcutaneous lung tumor model, the effects of each treatment on
long-term survival (Kaplan-Meier curves) were analyzed using
log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests, with significance levels of 0.05.
Significant differences between orthotopic LLC tumor
volumes following micelle or β-lap micelle treatments were
estimated using two-tailed t tests of unequal variance, where
P values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. All statistical
analyses were performed with assistance and final verification
from the Biostatistics Core (Simmons Comprehensive Cancer
Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center).

Results
β-Lap was incorporated into PEg-PLA (molecular weight,
10,000 Da) polymer micelles using a film sonication procedure (Fig. 2A; ref. 25). The resulting nanoparticles possessed
core-shell morphology and were spherical and highly monodisperse, as verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM;
Fig. 2B). Micellar diameters averaged 26.8 ± 3.2 nm, as measured by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2C). β-Lap micelles
had loading efficiency and density values of 39.8 ± 1.0%
and 2.2 ± 0.1%, respectively (25). As reported previously,
the release kinetics of β-lap from polymer micelles exhibited

diffusion-based release behavior, with 50% drug release within 18 hours, and the majority of drug (>75%) was released
over the course of 4 days.
To investigate the safety of β-lap micelles, morbidity and
mortality responses were recorded in healthy mice at different doses of β-lap·HPβ-CD complexes or β-lap micelles
(Supplementary Table S1). Five i.v. injections every other day
of 30 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD resulted in no deaths. However,
moderate side effects were observed, with mice experiencing
labored breathing and an irregular gait. These symptoms were
more intense at higher doses of 40 and 50 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD,
yielding severe muscle contractions, labored breathing, and
lethality in some cases. A dose of 60 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD
resulted in severe morbidity and eventually 100% lethality.
In contrast, β-lap micelle doses ranging from 30 to 50 mg/kg
did not result in any deaths and had significantly less side effects. Mice injected with 40 and 50 mg/kg of β-lap micelles experienced mild and moderate labored breathing and irregular
gait. At 60 mg/kg β-lap micelles, animal reactions were severe
and animal deaths (∼40%) ensued. As a result of these studies,
we concluded that optimal doses of β-lap micelles were in the
range of 30 to 50 mg/kg, and a clear safety advantage of β-lap
micelles over β-lap·HPβ-CD.
Prior clinical trial data suggested that improved β-lap
formulations are necessary to reduce dose-limiting toxicity
(e.g., hemolytic anemia) of cyclodextrin-complexed β-lap (9).
To investigate this, we compared the percentage (%) of hemolysis of different β-lap formulations (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Data show that β-lap·HPβ-CD indeed caused hemolysis, with

concentrations at 1.0 and 1.5 mg/mL β-lap resulting in 47 ±
1% and 52 ± 2% hemolysis, respectively. However, we noted
that HPβ-CD alone caused significant hemolysis (94 ± 1%)
at HPβ-CD concentrations required to solubilize β-lap
at 1.5 mg/mL. Importantly, no measurable hemolysis
was observed from β-lap micelles at all concentrations
examined.
Exposure of RBCs to β-lap affected hemoglobin (Hb), the
major component of RBCs. In samples coincubated with
β-lap·HPβ-CD, a blue shift of the Hb λmax was noted from
415 nm to a lower wavelength of 408 nm (Supplementary
Fig. S1C), a shift missing in HPβ-CD alone samples. Importantly, this change in λmax of Hb was not apparent in β-lap
micelle samples, given their inability to cause cell lysis and
release Hb. Moreover, in samples coincubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 treatment, two Hb peaks were noted at 541 and
576 nm (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These two characteristic
peaks were also apparent in samples with HPβ-CD–induced
hemolysis. In samples treated with β-lap·HPβ-CD, however, a
new peak was observed at 628 nm that was absent in samples treated with Triton X-100, HPβ-CD, and β-lap micelles.
Both the shift in the Hb λmax at 408 nm and the appearance
of the new peak at 628 nm are indicative of conversion of the
ferrous (Fe2+) form of Hb to a ferric (Fe3+) form known as
methemoglobin (27–29), a conversion that is absent in
β-lap micelles.
The pharmacokinetics of β-lap micelles were examined in
mice bearing A549 NSCLC xenografts. The blood concentration of β-lap micelles was prolonged over a 24-hour time
span, with a distribution phase half-life (t1/2,α) of 2 hours
and an elimination half-life (t1/2,β) of 28 hours (Fig. 3A).
β-Lap micelles had a slow clearance rate, ∼2 mL/h/kg. After
24 hours, ∼20% of the initial dose was still present in the
blood. Tissue distributions of β-lap micelles were measured
at 2 and 24 hours after i.v. injection in organs including the
liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidneys, muscle, brain, and tumor
(Fig. 3B). The largest accumulation of β-lap micelles was
found in the spleen after 2 hours, with ∼5.8% of the injected
dose per gram tissue (% ID/g). β-Lap micelles also accumulated in the liver and kidneys but to a lesser extent, with 3.4%
and 1.1% ID/g, respectively. In contrast, relatively minor
levels of β-lap micelles were observed in other organs,
including the heart, lungs, and muscle, 2 hours after injection. Conversely, significant β-lap micelle accumulation
was noted in tumor tissue, reaching a level of ∼1.5% ID/g.
These levels remain relatively constant over prolonged times,
as 1.6% ID/g β-lap micelles were found in tumor tissue at
24 hours. Micelle accumulation decreased slightly over time
in organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidney 24 hours after
injection. In contrast, the level of β-lap micelles in liver and
spleen increased from 2 to 24 hours, reflecting lower blood
circulation and their role as main clearance routes for
β-lap micelles (Fig. 3B).
To examine the potential toxicity of micelle carriers due
to increased RES uptake, we performed histologic analyses
of liver, spleen, and kidney and compared the results with
HPβ-CD. The spleen, kidney, and liver were affected to a
greater degree in the HPβ-CD carrier group than in the

micelle carrier group (Supplementary Fig. S3). The spleens in
the HPβ-CD carrier group had extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis with abundant megakaryocytes in the red pulp
and subcapsular region. This phenomenon was not observed
in the micelle carrier group. The HPβ-CD carrier group
showed collapsed glomeruli affecting between 5% and ∼15%
of glomeruli. In contrast, the kidneys pertaining to the micelle
carrier group were histologically unremarkable. Chronic
inflammation was seen in the portal regions in livers of both
groups, consisting primarily of lymphocytes. Portal inflammation was much greater in the HPβ-CD carrier group when
compared with the micelle carrier group and was shown to
extend to the central vein region.
Figure 4A shows the antitumor responses of subcutaneous
A549 lung tumors treated with β-lap·HPβ-CD. The 30 mg/kg
dose of β-lap·HPβ-CD proved rather ineffective at suppressing tumor growth, with only a slight improvement over
the HPβ-CD vehicle control. Improved antitumor efficacy
was noted at 40 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD, especially at earlier

times of tumor growth. At day 9, HPβ-CD controls and
30 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD measured 462 ± 151 mm 3 and
353 ± 39 mm3, respectively. In contrast, tumors treated with
40 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD measured 226 ± 15 mm3, a minimal
increase from its starting size of 210 ± 18 mm3. After day
9 (completion of treatment), tumors in the 40 mg/kg
β-lap·HPβ-CD group rapidly increased in size, nearly
doubling to 404 ± 98 mm3 by day 16. Kaplan-Meier survival
data (Fig. 4B) show that 30 and 40 mg/kg doses of
β-lap·HPβ-CD only resulted in 20% of mice surviving over
the course of 100 days, with no statistical significance
between 40 and 30 mg/kg β-lap·HPβ-CD or HPβ-CD alone
groups.
In contrast to β-lap·HPβ-CD, all doses of β-lap micelles
(30, 40, and 50 mg/kg) suppressed A549 NSCLC tumor
growth from days 1 to 9 (Fig. 4C). More importantly, these
doses did not result in any deaths during administration.
At day 9, whereas control tumors reached a volume of 495 ±
125 mm3, tumors treated with β-lap micelles measured 279 ±
51 mm3, 268 ± 72 mm3, and 149 ± 114 mm3 at 30, 40, and
50 mg/kg, respectively. At 50 mg/kg β-lap micelles, tumor

regression (from an initial volume of 224 ± 24 mm3 ) was
noted. After day 9, tumors in the 30 mg/kg group began to
grow, reaching 500 ± 84 mm3 by day 21. Tumors in mice treated
with 40 mg/kg maintained volumes of ∼300 mm3 until day 21,
after which the average volume was 306 ± 135 mm3. Contrary to
what was observed at equivalent doses in β-lap·HPβ-CD, 60%
and 80% of animals treated with 30 and 40 mg/kg of β-lap micelles, respectively, survived 100 days. Animals receiving
50 mg/kg β-lap micelles resulted in the greatest efficacy and tumor regression, with tumors at days 14 and 21 measuring 170 ±
83 mm3 and 152 ± 110 mm3, respectively. Furthermore, KaplanMeier data (Fig. 4D) show that 50 mg/kg β-lap micelles significantly improved survival versus vehicle control (P = 0.01), with
no lethality observed >100 days after treatment.
The antitumor efficacy of β-lap micelles was then investigated in a lung tumor model using athymic mice bearing
orthotopic LLC tumors, a tumor cell line that undergoes
NQO1-dependent cell death following β-lap administration
in vitro. As can be seen from Supplementary Fig. S2, β-lap
treatment of LLC tumors led to DNA damage, corroborated
by alkaline comet assays, and subsequent PARP-1 hyperactivation

was indicated by PAR accumulation, as depicted in the
Western blot. To gain further insight into the effect of
β-lap micelles on disease progression, a separate study
was performed in which BLI of mice was conducted
throughout the course of treatment. Bioluminescence
images of tumor growth in controls illustrate rapid tumor
growth at day 9 (Fig. 5A), whereas β-lap micelle treatments resulted in significant tumor suppression. This was
also evident on gross examination of control-treated and
β-lap micelle–treated tumors, explanted at day 9. Lungs
from control mice bore heavy tumor burdens compared
with mice treated with β-lap micelles, with several peasized tumor nodules visible in controls, whereas few visible
tumors were noted after β-lap micelle treatment. H&E
analyses showed considerably increased tumor invasion

throughout the lung parenchyma in control lungs compared with those of β-lap micelle–treated mice, corroborating the aforementioned survival, BLI, and tumor
burden results. Indeed, on quantification (Fig. 5B), the
tumor burden in lungs of control mice was more than
double that noted in the lungs of mice treated with β-lap
micelles (P = 0.01). Animal survival analysis shows that
50% of control animals died from disease at day 6, and
all animals expired at day 7, confirming the aggressive
nature of orthotopic LLC in athymic mice (Fig. 5C; ref. 30).
In contrast, mice treated with 40 mg/kg β-lap micelles exhibited 50% death at day 9, with 5% surviving until day 17.
Importantly, Kaplan-Meier curves indicate a statistically
significant (P = 0.008) survival advantage with β-lap micelles
over micelle carrier alone.

β-Lapachone Nanotherapeutics for NSCLC

Discussion
In this study, β-lap micelles were proposed as a safe and
efficacious nanotherapeutic strategy for the clinical translation of a promising anticancer agent. Although complexation was shown to dramatically increase its solubility and
facilitated its clinical testing (8), various clinical trials reported that β-lap·HPβ-CD resulted in hemolytic anemia,
significantly hindering its clinical potential (9). In this study,
the complexation of β-lap and HPβ-CD proved hemolytic
in vitro. β-Lap micelles, on the other hand, showed no evidence of hemolysis. In addition to hemolysis, β-lap·HPβCD also interacted with Hb, presumably by oxidation of
the iron component of Hb (Fe2+ to Fe3+). Such oxidation
of iron is consistent with the known ROS generation by
naphthoquinones (4). The mechanism by which β-lap converts the ferrous ion of Hb to methemoglobin is currently
unclear but is hypothesized to involve metabolism of the
drug by enzymes in RBCs (31). β-Lap can be metabolized
into at least six distinct metabolites after incubation with
RBCs (31), and ROS resulting from this metabolism may
convert Hb to methemoglobin. Research is under way to investigate this mechanism and the in vivo consequences, as
methemoglobinemia can lead to a decreased ability to carry
oxygen, resulting in tissue hypoxia (28). Importantly, β-lap
micelles are designed so that β-lap remains in the hydrophobic core of micelles, preventing drug interaction with
RBCs and avoiding methemoglobinemia.
Prior studies showed that β-lap·HPβ-CD exhibited very
short half-lives in blood, with an elimination phase half-life
of ∼24 minutes (unpublished results) and a clearance rate
of 14 L/h/kg. The relatively weak binding affinity of β-lap
with HPβ-CD (Kd = 1.1 × 10−3 mol/L; ref. 8) apparently leads
to rapid β-lap·HPβ-CD dissociation following injection as
well as even distribution to all organs. This pharmacokinetic profile is not therapeutically effective due to inadequate
tumor accumulation and nonspecific toxicity to healthy
tissues.
In the current study, 3 H-labeled PEG-PLA was used
to measure the nanoparticle pharmacokinetics (32, 33).
β-Lap micelles have prolonged circulation in blood, with
an elimination phase half-life of 28 hours. The increased
residence time of micelles in blood is beneficial for therapy,
given that micelles can circulate longer, increasing the possibility of extravasation to tumor tissues during multiple
passes. Consequently, we showed a comparatively higher
accumulation of β-lap micelles in tumors over most normal
tissues. This accumulation in tumors is most likely due to
the EPR effect, or passive targeting, arising from the “leaky”
vasculature of tumors (21, 22). It has been shown that
fenestrations in tumor vasculature can be as large as
550 nm (34), a size that should allow for efficient extravasation of the 30-nm–sized β-lap micelles. Moreover, this
deposition of micelles within the tumor seemed constant
from 2 to 24 hours, suggesting impaired lymphatic drainage
of tumor tissue (35). In addition to poor lymphatic drainage, micelle uptake and retention in tumor cells can also
contribute to heightened and sustained accumulation over

time. Savic and coworkers (36) examined the cell uptake of
fluorescently labeled polymeric micelles and showed that
micelles were internalized by endocytosis and distributed
among several cytoplasmic organelles (e.g., lysosomes and
endoplasmic reticulum). Taken together, our data suggest
that β-lap micelles can effectively extravasate to, and remain within, tumors for prolonged times while exerting
antitumor effects through drug release.
Results from this study show that β-lap·HPβ-CD administration to mice bearing subcutaneous NSCLC tumors failed
to induce significant tumor growth delay or prolonged survival when compared with controls. Michaelis and colleagues
(37) showed that a higher dose of a CD formulation of aphidicolin was necessary to match the efficacy of a low dose of a
liposomal formulation of the drug. Similarly, Singla and colleagues (38) highlighted the disadvantages associated with
paclitaxel-cyclodextrin formulations in vivo, stating that precipitation of the drug on blood dilution was a major deterrent to its clinical use. In light of these limitations, an
alternate drug delivery strategy was necessary to fully harness the antitumor effects of β-lap. As hypothesized, β-lap
micelles greatly improved not only animal safety and tolerability but also in vivo antitumor efficacy and animal survival,
highlighting a distinct advantage over its cyclodextrin counterpart. When administered i.v., β-lap micelles effectively
inhibited tumor growth compared with tumors treated with
controls. When an orthotopic model was examined, β-lap
micelles prolonged survival in an otherwise very aggressive
tumor model. Previous results show that β-lap is effective
against NSCLCs, such as A549 cells, which express threshold
levels of NQO1, and kills irrespective of p53 and cell cycle
status (3–6). This study validates the antitumor efficacy of
β-lap micelles, a strategy that was shown to spare normal
cells and tissues that express no or low levels of the enzyme.
In spite of elevated accumulation in organs such as the liver
and spleen, where indications of portal inflammation were
present possibly due to elevated levels of NQO1 in the murine
liver, β-lap micelles did not induce significant acute or
chronic toxicity, as evidenced by tolerability (e.g., no weight
loss) and prolonged survival of treated animals. Moreover, it
is expected that β-lap micelles will result in low levels of
toxicity in the human liver, where low levels of NQO1 are
expressed (39, 40). Hence, improved efficacy of β-lap micelles
was a result of both pharmacokinetic targeting of tumors
through increased micelle accumulation and pharmacodynamic targeting of tumors overexpressing NQO1 by β-lap.
In summary, we highlight the clinical potential of a novel
β-lap nanotherapeutic platform for the treatment of lung cancers with elevations in NQO1. Polymeric micelles prove a safe
delivery platform for β-lap, allowing them to evade hemolytic
anemia reactions, with reduced side effects and toxicity. Incorporation of the drug within micelles increased blood residence
time, heightened tumor accumulation, and significantly lowered its toxicity. β-Lap micelles were highly efficacious in
treating both subcutaneous and orthotopic lung tumors that
overexpress NQO1. The unique integration of nanotechnology
and NQO1 specificity should result in enhanced efficacy in
future clinical applications.
