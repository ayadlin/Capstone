ABSTRACT
Docetaxel (DTX) is a useful chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of
hormone-refractory prostate cancer. However, emergence of DTX resistance has
been a therapeutic hurdle. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining
DTX with Bcl-2 family inhibitors using human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, LNCaP,
and DU145 cells). PC3 cells were less sensitive to DTX than were the other two
cell lines. In contrast to ABT-199, which inhibits Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, both ABT-263
and ABT-737, which inhibit Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, significantly augmented the
antitumor effect of DTX on PC3 cells. ABT-263 also enhanced the antitumor effect
of DTX on a DTX-resistant PC3 variant cell line. The antitumor effect of ABT-263
was due mainly to its inhibitory effect on Bcl-xL. In a xenograft mouse model,
DTX and ABT-737 combination therapy significantly inhibited PC3 tumor growth.
Interestingly, although ABT-263 activated caspase-9 in PC3 cells, inhibition of
caspase-9 unexpectedly promoted ABT-263-induced apoptosis in a caspase8-dependent manner. This augmented apoptosis was also observed in LNCaP cells.
These findings indicate that Bcl-xL inhibition can sensitize DTX-resistant prostate
cancer cells to DTX, and they reveal a unique apoptotic pathway in which antagonism
of Bcl-2 family members in caspase-9-inhibited prostate cancer cells triggers
caspase-8-dependent apoptosis.

Apoptosis is primarily induced in cancer cells
through two major pathways: extrinsic and intrinsic
pathways [6, 7]. Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
can provide a death signal via the ‘extrinsic’ apoptotic
pathway, activating caspase-8 in cancer cells. In contrast,
cytotoxic drugs and high-dose radiation damage DNA
and mitochondria, resulting in activation of the ‘intrinsic’
caspase-9-mediated apoptotic pathway. Although
several molecules participate in mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis [8–10], Bcl-2 family molecules play a crucial
role in this type of apoptosis [11, 12]. The family of Bcl2-related anti-apoptotic proteins includes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is one of the most common
malignant disorders found in males worldwide. Although
early-stage prostate cancer can be well-controlled by
surgery or radiotherapy, patients with advanced prostate
cancer are treated with hormone therapy [1], and after a
short-term remission, surviving cancer cells often return
with increased malignancy [2]. Docetaxel (DTX) has
been used as a chemotherapeutic drug to combat recurrent
prostate cancer [3–5]; however, malignant cells frequently
acquire DTX resistance, and efficient treatment modalities
to overcome this resistance are required.

Bcl-w, and Mcl-1. These proteins inhibit cell death
by sequestering the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and
Bak and by preventing their oligomerization [13–16].
Elevation of Bcl-2 expression protects cancer cells
from apoptosis [17, 18], and the elevated expression
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL has been frequently observed in a
variety of cancers [12]. Additionally, a survey of gene
expression and response to chemotherapy agents in
the NCI-60 panel identified Bcl-xL as a major cause of
chemoresistance in epithelial cancer cells [19]. Thus,
inhibition of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL is hypothesized to
potentiate the effect of chemotherapy, and consequently
several Bcl-2 family inhibitors/antagonists have been
developed. ABT-737 is a small molecule inhibitor of
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w [20]. ABT-263 (Navitoclax)
is a clinically available and orally bioavailable inhibitor
with the same specificity as ABT-737 [21, 22]. In
addition, ABT-199 is a new, orally bioavailable inhibitor
that inhibits Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, but not Bcl-xL [23].
Several reports have shown efficacy of these inhibitors
against both hematological malignancies as well as
several types of solid tumors [24–30].
In this study, we investigated the effect of
combining DTX with Bcl-2 family inhibitors in three
human prostate cancer cell lines: PC3, LNCaP, and
DU145 cells. Among them, PC3 cells were less sensitive
to DTX than were the other two lines, but ABT-263 and
ABT-737 significantly augmented the sensitivity of these
cells to DTX. RNA interference experiments showed that
ABT-263 augmented the antitumor effect of DTX on PC3
cells via Bcl-xL inhibition. In a xenograft mouse model,
DTX and ABT-737 combination therapy significantly
inhibited the growth of PC3 cells compared with either
therapy alone. Additionally, despite the fact that ABT-263
activated caspase-9 in PC3 cells, inhibition of caspase-9
unexpectedly promoted ABT-263-induced apoptosis in a
caspase-8-dependent manner. These findings indicate that
Bcl-xL inhibition by ABT-263 or ABT-737 can sensitize
DTX-resistant prostate cancer cells to DTX, and they
reveal a unique apoptotic pathway in which antagonism
of Bcl-2 family members in caspase-9-inhibited prostate
cancer cells triggers caspase-8-dependent apoptosis.

of PC3 cells more drastically than did ABT-199 with
suboptimal doses of DTX. Selected data are shown in
Fig. 1B. Such a synergistic effect was not observed
in LNCaP or DU145 cells. The effect of these drug
combinations on a normal prostate epithelial cell line,
PrEC, was also assessed (Fig. 1C). PrEC cells were
less sensitive to DTX but more sensitive to ABT-263,
compared with prostate cancer cell lines. No synergistic
effect of DTX combined with ABT-263 was observed
in PrEC cells. The expression of Bcl-2 family proteins
(anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1 and pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and Bak)
was then examined in the three prostate cancer cell lines
(Fig. 1D). All three cell lines showed expression of each
molecule evaluated at the protein level, except for a lack
of detectable expression of Bax in DU145 cells.

Bcl-xL plays a major role in protection of PC3
cells against DTX cytotoxicity
Given the difference in specificity of inhibition
between ABT-263 and ABT-199, we examined whether
the augmenting effect of ABT-263 was due to its
inhibition of Bcl-xL alone versus the inhibition of both
Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. When transfected into PC3 cells,
small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to either Bcl-2
or Bcl-xL decreased the expression of the respective
proteins (Fig. 2A). Additionally, although selective
knockdown of Bcl-2 showed a tendency to decrease cell
viability, Bcl-xL knockdown significantly decreased the
viability of PC3 cells in the presence of low-dose DTX,
to the same level as that caused by double knockdown
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Fig. 2B). Relatedly, knockdown
of Bcl-xL increased the percentage of apoptotic PC3
cells in the presence of low-dose DTX to the same
level as that caused by double knockdown of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL (Fig. 2C and D). These results indicate that the
augmented antitumor effect induced by ABT-263 in
PC3 cells treated with low-dose DTX is primarily due
to inhibition of Bcl-xL.

Effect of combining DTX with ABT-263 in a
DTX-resistant PC3 variant cell line

RESULTS

As described above, the emergence of DTX
resistance in prostate cancer cells has become an important
therapeutic challenge. Accordingly, we established a DTXresistant PC3 variant cell line, designated DR-PC3, and
examined the effect of DTX and ABT-263 combination
treatment in this cell line. DR-PC3 cells grew more
slowly than did parental PC3 cells and showed a thinner
appearance than the parental PC3 cells (data not shown).
The DR-PC3 cells showed significant resistance to DTX
compared with parental PC3 cells (Fig. 3A). DR-PC3 cells
also exhibited higher resistance to ABT-263 at a dose of
10 or 20 μM, compared with parental PC3 cells (Fig. 3B).

Bcl-2 family inhibitors in human prostate
cancer cells
Initially, the cytotoxic effect of combining DTX
with either of two Bcl-2 family inhibitors, ABT-263 and
ABT-199, was assessed using three prostate cancer cell
lines (Fig. 1A). Among the three cell lines, PC3 cells
were relatively resistant to DTX and DU145 cells were
less sensitive to both inhibitors compared with the other
two cell lines. Of note, ABT-263 decreased the viability

When treated with both DTX and ABT-263, although the

PC3 cells, ABT-263 (5 or 10 μM) augmented the antitumor
effect of 50 and 200 nM DTX (Fig. 3C). Selected data are
shown in Fig. 3D. These results suggest that ABT-263 has
the potential to sensitize DTX-resistant prostate cancer
cells to DTX-induced cytotoxicity.

after grouping in combination with DTX (10 mg/kg)
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 1 and 3 after
grouping; no significant synergistic effect on the
growth of PC3 was observed (Fig. 4A). Subsequently,
we used ABT-737, which has the same specificity as
ABT-263 yet can be administered systemically. In
in vitro studies, the combination of ABT-737 and DTX
synergistically decreased the viability of PC3 cells to a
similar degree as seen with ABT-263 (Fig. 4B and C).
ABT-737 showed a similar effect on the normal prostate
epithelial cell line PrEC, but to a lesser degree than
that of ABT-263 (Fig. 4D). To determine the doses
of DTX and ABT-737 used for in vivo study, we

performed preliminary experiments. In the first, all
PC3-bearing mice died following i.p. administration of
DTX (30 mg/kg) on days 0, 2, and 4 after grouping,
suggesting that DTX (30 mg/kg) administration
three times at 2-day intervals was too much. In the
second experiment, although i.p. administration
of DTX (10 mg/kg) or ABT-737 (100 mg/kg)
alone on days 0, 3, and 6 after grouping showed no
effect on mortality, the combination of both resulted in
the deaths of all of the mice. Based on these results,
we performed experiments in which PC3-bearing mice
were injected i.p. with DTX (10 mg/kg) and/or ABT-737
(50 mg/kg) on days 0 and 4 after grouping (Fig. 4E).

In PC3-grafted nude mice, DTX and ABT-737
combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor
growth compared with the groups treated with either
drug alone (Fig. 4E and F). Body weight was also
measured, as an indicator of general health, and was
found to decrease in all groups, in accompaniment
with tumor growth and probably due to cachexia. Body
weight loss was most apparent in the mice treated with
the combination therapy, but the difference was not
significant, and no mortality was observed (Fig. 4G).
These results indicate that Bcl-2 family inhibitors such
as ABT-737 can sensitize the partially DTX-resistant
human prostate cancer cells to DTX in vivo.

(PI) was performed. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of
PC3 cells with the combination therapy increased the
proportion of Annexin V+ apoptotic cells significantly,
as compared with either therapy alone. Immunoblot
analysis revealed that treatment of PC3 cells with
ABT-263 alone activated caspase-3, -8, -9, and -2,
and that co-treatment with DTX further increased the
activation levels of caspase-3 and -9 (Fig. 5B), implying
that combination therapy enhanced apoptosis in a
caspase-9-dependent manner. This phenomenon was
further confirmed using a panel of caspase inhibitors.
In PC3 cells co-treated with DTX and ABT-263, the
percentage of Annexin V+ apoptotic cells was decreased
by the addition of inhibitors against pan-caspase,
caspase-8, or caspase-2 (Fig. 5C). Unexpectedly,
incubation with a caspase-9 inhibitor increased the
percentage of Annexin V+ apoptotic PC3 cells. The
degree of apoptosis was further enhanced when
caspase-9 inhibitor-treated PC3 cells were co-treated
with ABT-263, but not with DTX (Fig. 5D).

Annexin V+/PI+ (late) apoptosis of ABT-263-treated

blocked by caspase-8 inhibition (Fig. 6B and C). Caspase-2
inhibition also blocked the enhanced apoptosis (Annexin V+/

cells, but the restoration effect was small.

Given the existence of the caspase-9-independent,
Smac-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
[32, 33], the involvement of Smac in the enhanced
apoptosis observed was examined. However, knockdown
of Smac by siRNA failed to affect the increase in

caspase-9 inhibitor (Suppl. Fig. 1). Given that apoptosis
can also be induced in human prostate cancer cells via
the interaction of Fas and FasL [34, 35], we examined the
involvement of this pathway in the augmented, caspase8-dependent apoptosis of PC3 cells co-treated with ABT263 and the caspase-9 inhibitor. However, PC3 cells
showed no Fas expression and only a portion of the cells
expressed FasL; furthermore, incubation with an anti-FasL
blocking antibody had no effect on apoptosis of PC3 cells
treated with both ABT-263 and the caspase-9 inhibitor
(Suppl. Fig. 2).
The effect of ABT-263/caspase-9 inhibitor
co-treatment on apoptosis was also examined in several
other prostate cancer cell lines. Caspase-9 inhibition
was found to significantly increase apoptosis in

ABT-263-treated LNCaP cells, and subsequent inhibition of
caspase-8 blocked this augmentation (Fig. 7A). In contrast,
the addition of the caspase-9 inhibitor significantly inhibited
apoptosis of ABT-263-treated DU145 cells. Representative
data are shown in Fig. 7B.

DISCUSSION
Prostate cancer has become an increasingly
prevalent malignancy in males worldwide. Although
several treatment options exist for patients with prostate
cancer, DTX resistance is an urgent issue to be overcome
as quickly as possible. In this study, we investigated the
therapeutic effect of combining DTX and Bcl-2 family
inhibitors in human prostate cancer cells. Our findings

revealed that ABT-263 and ABT-737 have the potential to
enhance the sensitivity of the partially DTX-insensitive
PC3 prostate cancer cell line, and that this effect is largely
due to Bcl-xL inhibition. Additionally, we uncovered
a unique apoptotic pathway in which ABT-263 and
caspase-9 inhibition paradoxically promote apoptosis in
human prostate cancer cells, despite the fact that ABT-263
activates caspase-9.
Of the three human prostate cancer cell lines
examined, PC3 cells were less sensitive to DTX,
compared with LNCaP and DU145 cells, and exhibited
enhanced sensitivity to DTX when treated with
ABT-263, but not with ABT-199 (Fig. 1). Given the
difference in specificity between ABT-263 and ABT-199,
we examined whether the augmenting effect of ABT263 was dependent on inhibition of Bcl-xL alone versus
both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. RNA interference experiments
revealed that Bcl-xL inhibition by ABT-263 was mainly
responsible for the augmented cytotoxicity in PC3 cells
(Fig. 2). This result was plausible because cytotoxic
anti-cancer drugs induce mitochondria-mediated and
caspase-9-dependent apoptosis and because Bcl-xL
over-expression is a major cause of chemoresistance in
many types of epithelial cancer cells [19].
Apoptosis is triggered primarily through the
‘extrinsic’ or ‘intrinsic’ caspase-dependent cell death
pathways, and caspase-8 and -9, respectively, play central
roles in these pathways [6, 7]. Additionally, activation
of caspase-8 transforms Bid to tBid, thereby promoting
mitochondrial-mediated caspase-9-dependent apoptosis.
When cancer cells are exposed to anti-cancer drugs,
changes in pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic molecules
occur at the mitochondrial membrane, leading to
activation of caspase-9 [6]. In the current study, although
sub-optimal doses of DTX failed to activate any caspases,
ABT-263 alone activated caspase-3, -8, -9, and -2 in PC3
cells (Fig. 5B). The combination of DTX and ABT-263
further increased the activation of caspase-3 and -9,
suggesting that the enhanced apoptotic effect achieved
by co-treatment with DTX and ABT-263 was due mainly
to caspase-9 activation.
Unexpectedly, although ABT-263 induced
caspase-9 activation, apoptosis of ABT-263-treated PC3
cells was paradoxically increased by the addition of a
caspase-9 inhibitor. Of note, this augmented apoptosis
was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that the enhanced apoptosis was
definitely caspase-dependent. Therefore, we attempted
to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In addition to
the caspase-9-mediated pathway, the release of Smac/
DIABLO from the mitochondria promotes caspasedependent apoptosis by inhibiting apoptotic inhibitors
[32, 33]. Therefore, this possibility was examined;
however, knockdown of Smac had no effect on the
induction of apoptosis in PC3 cells when treated with
ABT-263 and the casapse-9 inhibitor (Suppl. Fig. 1).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The possible participation of caspase-2 in this process
was also evaluated. Caspase-2 has been suggested to
participate in reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis
[36], but the precise roles of this “orphan” caspase in
cancer cell apoptosis have not been elucidated fully
[37]. ABT-263 alone activated caspase-2 in PC3 cells
(Fig. 5B), and this activation was slightly increased
by the addition of the caspase-9 inhibitor (Fig. 6A).
Inhibition of caspase-2 showed a tendency towards
decreased apoptosis (only Annexin V+/PI- (early)
apoptosis) in ABT-263-treated PC3 cells co-treated
with the caspase-9 inhibitor (Fig. 6 B and C). In these
experiments, caspase-8, which is a main caspase in the
‘extrinsic’ apoptotic pathway, was found to participate
in this apoptotic process, and the addition of a caspase-8
inhibitor clearly decreased apoptosis of ABT-263-treated
PC3 cells under caspase-9 inhibition. This apoptotic
inhibition by the caspase-8 inhibitor was more dramatic
than that seen with the caspase-2 inhibitor. Interestingly,
activation of caspase-2 has been reported to activate
caspase-8, and sequential activation of caspase-2 and -8
is essential for saikosaponin A-induced apoptosis in
human cancer cells [38]. Nevertheless, these lines of
evidence reveal that treatment of caspase-9-inhibited
prostate cancer cells with ABT-263 can trigger apoptosis
mainly through activation of caspase-8.
What remains unclear is the mechanism by which
caspase-8 becomes activated. ABT-263 alone activated
caspase-8 in PC3 cells (Fig. 5B), and the combination
of ABT-263 and caspase-9 inhibition also promoted
caspase-8 activation (Fig. 6A). Because c-FLIP is
known to inhibit caspase-8 activation [6], the possible
involvement of c-FLIP was examined initially. The
expression of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS in PC3 cells was
measured, but no apparent change was observed in cells
treated with both the caspase-9 inhibitor and ABT-263
(Fig. 6A). It has also been reported that apoptosis can be
induced in human prostate cancer cells via the interaction
of Fas and FasL [34, 35]. Therefore, we tested whether
PC3 cells express Fas and FasL, and whether treatment
with anti-FasL blocking antibody could attenuate
apoptosis of PC3 cells treated with both ABT-263 and the
caspase-9 inhibitor. PC3 cells showed no Fas expression,
and only a portion of the PC3 cells expressed FasL.
Consistent with these findings, incubation with the antiFasL antibody had no impact on apoptosis of PC3 cells
treated with both ABT-263 and the caspase-9 inhibitor
(Suppl. Fig. 2). Presently, we have no clear explanation for
how caspase-8 is activated in ABT-263-treated PC3 cells
under conditions of caspase-9 inhibition; further study is
needed to elucidate the precise mechanism.
We tested three human prostate cancer cell lines
in the current study. Compared with the other two lines,
PC3 cells were less sensitive to DTX, but both ABT-263
and ABT-737 were able to sensitize PC3 cells to lowdose DTX. Of note, co-treatment with ABT-263 and
11408

Oncotarget

the caspase-9 inhibitor increased caspase-8-dependent
apoptosis not only in PC3 cells but also in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 7). In contrast, co-treatment with the caspase-9
inhibitor significantly decreased apoptosis in ABT-263treated DU145 cells. To explore possible explanations for
this finding, the expression of a panel of Bcl-2 family
proteins was examined in the three cell lines. DU145
cells showed no Bax expression and low Bak expression
(Fig. 1D); since these are both pro-apoptotic molecules,
this may account for the low sensitivity of the cells to
ABT-263. A similar finding has been reported in ABT737 and DU145 cells [24].
The therapeutic effect of combined DTX and
Bcl-2 family inhibition was also examined using a
xenograft mouse model. In this in vivo experiment, as
the Bcl-2 family inhibitor, we used ABT-737, which
has the same specificity of inhibition as ABT-263 yet
can be administered systemically [20]. The combination
therapy was found to significantly suppress PC3 tumor
growth, compared with either therapy alone. These results
suggest that the combination of Bcl-2 family inhibitors
with DTX is effective not only in vitro but also in vivo.
However, there remains a question. ABT-263 and ABT737 are supposed to be similar agents with similar effects,
however, the in vivo results in combination with DTX were
different. Although we have no clear answer regarding
this result at present, we suppose that this discrepancy in
therapeutic efficacy could result from the difference in the
administration routes of these reagents. We administered
ABT-263 orally at 20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days (on
days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 after grouping) in combination with
injections of DTX (10 mg/kg) twice (on days 1 and 3).
More frequent administration of ABT-263 with higher
doses could elicit a significant combination effect. We
have no idea regarding the quantity of orally administered
ABT-263 that would be absorbed in the intestine and have
no information about its pharmacokinetics. Thus, we
decided to use ABT-737, which showed similar activity
in vitro but can be administered systemically.
Among the three cell lines tested, androgenindependent DU145 cells were more resistant to
ABT-263 than the other two lines, and there was no
difference in the sensitivity of androgen-dependent
LNCaP and androgen-independent PC3 cells towards
ABT-263. Additionally, PC3 cells were more resistant to
DTX than LNCaP or DU145 cells. However, the results
with LNCaP cells provided additional information on the
role of p53 when these cells were treated with DTX and/or
ABT-263. LNCaP cells express wild-type p53, PC3 cells
do not express p53, and DU145 cells harbor a mutated
form of p53 [39]. Together, these lines of evidence
indicate that the sensitivity to ABT-263 and DTX seemed
to be unconnected to androgen dependency and p53.
Emergence of DTX resistance in prostate cancer
cells has been an important therapeutic hurdle. To this

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

end, we established a DTX-resistant PC3 variant cell line,
designated DR-PC3, in which we examined the cytotoxic
effect of DTX combined with ABT-263 (Fig. 3). Although
DR-PC3 cells were highly resistant to DTX, ABT-263
augmented the antitumor effect of DTX.
In summary, we investigated the sensitizing effect
of the Bcl-2 family inhibitors ABT-263 and ABT-737 on
the partially DTX-resistant PC3 human prostate cancer
cell line. Our data indicate that these Bcl-2 inhibitors
effectively enhance DTX-induced antitumor effects both
in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that ABT-263
and ABT-737 may be promising agents for restoring DTX
sensitivity to DTX-resistant human prostate cancers.

METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Three human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3,
and DU145) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA), and maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 20 μg/mL gentamicin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. PrEC
is a normal prostate epithelial cell line purchased from Lonza
(Walkersville, MD, USA). ABT-263 and ABT-737 were
purchased from Active Biochemicals Co., Ltd (Wan Chai,
Hong Kong). ABT-199 was purchased from ChemieTek
(Indianapolis, IN, USA). DTX was obtained from SigmaAldrich and diluted in ethanol and finally in PBS with
5% ethanol. The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK was
purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY,
USA), and the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-FMK, caspase-9
inhibitor z-LEHD-FMK, and caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVADFMK were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN, USA).

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was evaluated using the 2-(2-methoxy4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl) -5-(2, 4-disulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-8) assay (Nacalai
Tesque). Briefly, cells were seeded in flat-bottomed
96-well plates. At the assay endpoint (2 days postseeding), 10 μl WST-8 solution was added to each well,
and the plates were incubated for an additional 3 h. The
plates were read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a
microplate reader (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).

Establishment of a DTX-resistant PC3 variant
cell line
To establish a DTX-resistant PC3 cell line, parental
PC3 cells were cultured initially with 11 nM DTX and

11409

Oncotarget

then with 50 nM DTX for over 4 months. The established
DTX-resistant PC3 cell line was referred to as DR-PC3.

30 min at room temperature with an alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein
bands were visualized using CDP-star chemiluminescence
and imaged using a LAS-4000 (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan).

In vivo xenograft model
Male BALB nu/nu mice, purchased from CLEA
Japan (Tokyo, Japan), were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions. The protocol was approved
by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments
of the Shimane University Faculty of Medicine (Permit
Number: IZ26-212). All efforts were made to minimize
suffering. Mice were inoculated in the right flank with
3×106 PC3 cells and Matrigel (Japan BD Biosciences,
Tokyo, Japan) at a 1:1 volume ratio in a total volume of
100 μl. On day 7, the mice were pooled and divided into
four groups. On the indicated days, these PC3-bearing
mice were treated with DTX and/or ABT-263 or ABT737. As a vehicle control for DTX, 100 μl 5% ethanol
PBS was injected. As a vehicle control for ABT-263 and
ABT-737, 100 μl DMSO were administered. The tumor
size and product of the two perpendicular diameters
were measured every 3 or 4 days. Each group contained
six mice.
