ABSTRACT:
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is associated with genomic
instability. APE1 is a key player in DNA base excision repair (BER) and an emerging
drug target in cancer. We have developed small molecule inhibitors against APE1
repair nuclease activity. In the current study we explored a synthetic lethal
relationship between PTEN and APE1 in melanoma. Clinicopathological significance of
PTEN mRNA and APE1 mRNA expression was investigated in 191 human melanomas.
Preclinically, PTEN-deficient BRAF-mutated (UACC62, HT144, and SKMel28), PTENproficient BRAF-wildtype (MeWo), and doxycycline-inducible PTEN-knockout BRAFwildtype MeWo melanoma cells were DNA repair expression profiled and investigated
for synthetic lethality using a panel of four prototypical APE1 inhibitors. In human
tumours, low PTEN mRNA and high APE1 mRNA was significantly associated with
reduced relapse free and overall survival. Pre-clinically, compared to PTEN-proficient
cells, PTEN-deficient cells displayed impaired expression of genes involved in DNA
double strand break (DSB) repair. Synthetic lethality in PTEN-deficient cells was
evidenced by increased sensitivity, accumulation of DSBs and induction of apoptosis
following treatment with APE1 inhibitors. We conclude that PTEN deficiency is not only
a promising biomarker in melanoma, but can also be targeted by a synthetic lethality
strategy using inhibitors of BER, such as those targeting APE1.

INTRODUCTION

known as apurinic/apyrimidinic or AP sites) are cytotoxic
obligate repair intermediates generated during BER and
processed by human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1
(APE1). APE1 cleaves the phosphodiester DNA backbone
5’ to the AP site prior to further processing via either the
short patch or the long patch BER pathway. Unrepaired AP

Base excision repair (BER) is a critical and highly
conserved mechanism for the repair of damage induced
by alkylation and oxidation of DNA, including by
chemotherapy and ionising radiation [1]. Abasic sites (also

sites generate single strand breaks, which stall replication
fork progression and induce DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs) that are toxic to the cell at high density [2].
APE1 is a multifunctional protein [1, 3]. In addition
to BER functions, it possesses N-terminus redox activity,
which can activate pro-angiogenic and pro-survival
transcription factors. APE1 also has roles in acetylationmediated gene regulation and RNA quality control [4].
SiRNA-mediated APE1 downregulation induces AP site
accumulation and is associated with hypersensitivity to
DNA damaging agents, including alkylators and ionising
radiation [1]. Overexpression of APE1 confers resistance
to these agents, both in vitro and in vivo [1]. Furthermore,
exposure to alkylating agents causes upregulation
of endogenous APE1 levels, suggesting a role in the
development of treatment resistance [5]. APE1 expression
in human tumours may have prognostic or predictive
significance in patients [1].
In light of the evidence presented above, APE1
is an emerging anti-cancer drug target. [1, 3]. We have
initiated drug development programmes to identify novel
inhibitors of APE1 DNA repair function [6-11]. Several
of these compounds have shown promising preclinical
activity, including the potentiation of the cytotoxicity of
the alkylating agent temozolomide in cancer cell lines.
More recently, we have demonstrated synthetic lethality
of APE1 inhibition in BRCA-deficient cell systems [12],
analagous to results observed with PARP inhibitors
currently under development for treatment of HR-deficient
cancer [13, 14].
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is
a negative regulator of the anti-apoptotic PI3K/Akt
pathway [15]. PTEN mutation is reported in 5-20%
of primary melanomas, although PTEN mutation is
more frequently seen in melanoma cell lines (30-50%)
[16, 17]. Furthermore, transcriptional and translational
repression of PTEN function has been reported in up
to 65% of melanomas [18]. In addition to its inositol
phosphatase function, PTEN has recently been implicated
in the maintenance of genomic integrity [19-21]. PTENnull cells are associated with centromere-clustered
chromosome breakages, possibly due to interaction
with the centromeric protein CENP-C, which is vital for
centromeric stability during mitosis. Additionally, PTEN
might function as a transcriptional regulator of the critical
homologous recombination (HR) protein RAD51 via the
transcription factor Egr-1 [19-21]. Alternatively, PTEN
loss may be associated with altered expression of the
RAD51 paralogs [22] or impaired HR factor recruitment
to DNA damage due to cell cycle checkpoint defects [20].
SUMOylation may be essential for PTEN DNA repair
functions by directing nuclear PTEN localisation, with
PTEN-null or non-SUMOylatable mutant cells exhibiting
enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents [23]. In
keeping with these findings, PTEN -/- cells have been
demonstrated to possess a HR defect that is associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with synthetic lethality following PARP inhibitor exposure
[24]. However, although an association between RAD51
deficiency, impaired HR and PTEN deficiency has
been demonstrated in colorectal cancer cells [24] and
endometrial cancer cells [25], the association was not
demonstrated in prostate cancer models [22].
Loss of PTEN may promote melanoma development
[26], possibly as a cooperating mutation with BRAF
V600E [27]. Oncogenic BRAF V600 driver mutations
have recently emerged as a key therapeutic target [28],
leading to the development of vemurafanib [29]. Despite
BRAF-targeted therapy, many patients eventually progress
and succumb to the disease. Interestingly, a recent
study has suggested that PTEN loss may contribute to
BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma [30]. Therefore,
development of therapeutic strategies targeting PTEN
deficiency is highly desirable. In the current study, we
hypothesised a synthetic lethal relationship between
PTEN and APE1 in melanoma. We have measured mRNA
expression of PTEN and APE1 in 191 human melanomas
and correlated this with clinical and pathological factors.
We have confirmed the utility of APE1 inhibitors in the
presence of PTEN deficiency in melanoma cell lines.

RESULTS
Prognostic significance of PTEN mRNA and APE1
mRNA expression in human melanomas
Patient demographics of the 191 cases are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The
clinicopathological association data are summarised
in Supplementary Table S2. Relapse free and overall
survival data are summarized in Supplementary Table S3.
Low PTEN and high APE1 mRNA expression associated
with presence of vascular invasion (p=0.05) and high
mitotic rate (p=0.4), respectively. In the whole cohort
(n=191), low PTEN mRNA expression was significantly
associated with poor relapse free survival and overall
survival (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure 1A). High
APE1 mRNA expression was also significantly associated
with poor relapse free survival and overall survival
(supplementary Table S3 and Figure 1B) in the whole
cohort. When PTEN and APE1 are considered together,
patients with tumours that exhibit high PTEN and low
APE1 mRNA expression have a significantly better
prognosis compared to tumours that have low PTEN/high
APE1 mRNA expression or low PTEN/low APE1 mRNA
expression or high PTEN/high APE1 mRNA expression
(Figure 1C).
Given the evidence in murine models that low PTEN
and BRAF V600 mutations results in development of
metastatic melanoma [27], we conducted an exploratory
analysis based on PTEN mRNA expression and BRAF/

NRAS status. None of the patients with BRAF V600
mutation had received vemurafanib (BRAF inhibitor)
therapy. In tumours that had no BRAF or NRAS mutation,
low PTEN was significantly associated with poor overall
survival [HR (95%CI)=0.27 (0.12, 0.64), p=0.003]
(Figure 1D). In tumours that have BRAF mutation (Figure
1B) [HR (95%CI)=0.81 (0.46, 1.43), p=0.47] and in NRAS
mutants, low PTEN level did not significantly influence
prognosis (Figure 1C) [HR (95%CI)=0.88 (0.29, 2.69),
p=0.82]. Taken together, the data suggest that PTEN
deficiency is a promising prognostic marker in BRAF wild
type melanomas.

NRAS wildtype), SkMel28 (BRAF V600E mutant,
NRAS wildtype), HT144 (BRAF V600E mutant, NRAS
wildtype) and UACC62 (BRAF V600E mutant, NRAS
wildtype) melanoma cell lines were screened for PTEN
protein. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, western blot
analysis confirmed high PTEN protein levels in MeWo
cells. UACC62 and HT144 cells demonstrate an almost
complete absence of PTEN protein; SkMel28 exhibits
an intermediate level. All four cell lines are proficient in
APE1 expression. In keeping with previous studies [21,
24], PTEN-deficient HT144 and UACC62 melanoma
cells were also RAD51-deficient. RAD51 level was also
lower in SkMel28 cells compared to MeWo. However,
Fraser et al. did not observe RAD51 deficiency in
PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells [22]. Therefore, for
additional clarification, we explored protein levels of other
key DSB repair factors. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
PTEN-deficient cells exhibited consistently lower levels
of a number of DSB repair proteins compared to PTENproficient MeWo.
We proceeded to generate a doxycycline inducible
PTEN-knockdown, BRAF-proficient MeWo cell
line. Figure 2C and 2D demonstrates time-dependent
knockdown of PTEN protein expression following
doxycycline induction of lentiviral shRNA transduced

PTEN-deficient melanoma cell lines exhibit
altered DSB repair protein levels
The emerging role of PTEN in DNA repair [23]
and the association between low PTEN and impaired
DNA DSB repair [19-21] implies that PTEN- deficient
melanoma cells with defective DSB repair may be more
reliant upon BER to maintain genomic stability. To
investigate the hypothesis that PTEN loss is associated
with impaired HR, DSB repair protein levels were
examined in melanoma cell lines. MeWo (BRAF wildtype,

into MeWo cells. By day 7, PTEN protein level was
reduced to ~50% baseline, reaching >90% by day 14.
We confirmed reduced PTEN transcript production at day
21 by qRT-PCR (Figure 2D). Western blot examination
confirmed that levels of a number of DSB repair proteins
were reduced in PTEN-knockdown cells compared to noninduced controls (Figure 2E and 2F). Taken together, these
data confirm that PTEN loss is associated with reduced
DSB repair protein levels in melanoma cells.

PTEN-deficient cells (summarised in Supplementary Table
S5 and Supplementary Figure S1). This included several
repair factors that have previously been implicated in
PTEN deficiency, including RAD51 [21, 24, 37], MRE11
[22], and the RAD51 paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C,
RAD51D, XRCC2 and XRCC3 [38]. We also observed
low expression of a number of genes involved in nonhomologous end joining(NHEJ), as well as nucleotide
excision repair(NER) and mismatch repair(MMR).
Interestingly, significantly increased mRNA expression
of ATM, CCNH and DDB2 was also observed. Taken
together, the data suggest that PTEN-deficient melanoma
cells have complex patterns of DNA repair dysregulation
with consistent downregulation of genes involved in DSB
repair.

PTEN-deficient melanoma cells have dysregulated
DNA repair mRNA expression
To investigate DNA repair expression at the mRNA
level, we profiled a panel of 88 DNA repair genes in
MeWo, PTEN-knockdown MeWo, SkMel28, HT144
and UACC62 melanoma cells using the RT2 Profiler
DNA Repair PCR array. Significantly reduced mRNA
expression of several HR repair genes was observed in

PTEN-deficient melanoma cells are sensitive to
APE1 inhibitors

resulted in reduced survival of PTEN-deficient SKMel28,
UACC62, and HT144 cells in comparison to PTENproficient MeWo cells (Figure 3E-3H). Similarly, PTENknockdown MeWo cells exhibited significantly increased
sensitivity to APE1 inhibitor treatment compared to
control cells (Figures 4A-4D).
To confirm that selective toxicity is due to APE1
inhibtion, we utilised the indirect APE1 inhibitor
methoxyamine. Methoxyamine binds irreversibly to AP
sites in DNA [36], preventing APE1 from processing
the adducted AP lesions. Figure 5E demonstrates that
methoxyamine is more lethal to PTEN-deficient SKMel28,
UACC62, and HT144 cells than to PTEN-proficient MeWo
cells. Similarly, PTEN-knockdown MeWo cells were more
sensitive to methoxyamine compared to PTEN-proficient
control cells (Figure 4F). To further establish whether this
selective cytotoxicity was due to obstruction of BER, we
investigated NU1025, a PARP inhibitor that blocks the
BER-related single strand break repair (SSBR) pathway
[39]. Figure 4G demonstrates the increased toxicity of

As PTEN-deficient cells exhibited differential
expression of HR factors, blockade of BER through
APE1 inhibition could lead to synthetic lethality. To
test this hypothesis, we conducted studies in clinically
relevant PTEN-deficient and PTEN-proficient melanoma
cells using a panel of APE1 inhibitors. Four prototypical
APE1 inhibitors were evaluated (chemical structures are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2) in MeWo, SKMel28,
UACC62, HT144 and PTEN-knockdown MeWo cells.
We first confirmed target inhibition using the ARP assay.
A significant accumulation of AP sites in genomic DNA
was demonstrated following 2, 4 and 8 hours exposure to
inhibitor 1, inhibitor 2, inhibitor 3 or inhibitor 4 (Figures
3A-D). We then evaluated whether these inhibitors could
induce selective cytotoxicity in PTEN-deficient cells using
clonogenic survival assays. Treatment with each inhibitor

NU1025 in PTEN-deficient SKMel28, UACC62 and
HT144 cells compared to PTEN-proficient MeWo cells.
This result was repeated in PTEN-knockdown MeWo
cells, which were more sensitive to NU1025 (Figure 4H)
than PTEN-proficient MeWo cells. The data is consistent
with a previous study in which PTEN-deficient colorectal
cells were found to exhibit increased sensitivity to PARP
inhibition [24].

lethality in PTEN-deficient cells, we investigated the
functional consequence of APE1 inhibitor treatment. The
neutral COMET assay detects single and double strand
breaks(DSBs) in DNA. Figures 5A-5I summarise the
results for MeWo, SKMel28, UACC62, HT144 and PTENknockdown MeWo cells treated with APE1 inhibitors.
Mean tail moment was increased in all samples after APE1
inhibitor exposure compared to pre-treatment samples, and
was significantly higher in PTEN-deficient cells at 2, 4,
and 8 hours in comparison to PTEN-proficient cells, with
damage persisting to 48 hours. The data demonstrates that
PTEN-deficient cells accumulate greater numbers of DNA
breaks after exposure to an APE1 inhibitor compared to
PTEN-proficient cells.

is induced by DSBs, and can be used as a marker of
DSB formation. Following inhibitor exposure, γH2AX

SKMel28, UACC62, HT144 and PTEN-knockdown
MeWo cells. As shown in Figures 6A-6I, the percentage
of cells with more than six γH2AX foci following inhibitor
exposure was significantly higher in PTEN-deficient cells
compared to PTEN-proficient control cells. These data
provide additional evidence that PTEN-deficient cells
accumulate DSBs at an increased rate after exposure to an
APE1 inhibitor relative to PTEN-proficient MeWo cells.
DSB accumulation activates a complex cell cycle
checkpoint response that may result in eventual induction
of apoptosis. Apoptosis detection by FITC-annexin V flow
cytometric analysis was therefore performed in MeWo,
SKMel28, UACC62, HT144 and PTEN-knockdown
MeWo cells following exposure to inhibitor 1, inhibitor 2,
inhibitor 3, or inhibitor 4 for 24 or 48 hours. As shown in
Figure 7A-7I, the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis
following APE1 inhibitor exposure was significantly
higher in PTEN-deficient cells in comparison to PTENproficient MeWo cells.

Taken together, these functional studies provide
compelling evidence that APE1 inhibition induces a
synthetic lethal response in PTEN-deficient cells by
causing accumulation of abasic sites and subsequent
strand breaks, and ultimately the induction of apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
PTEN is a key regulator of the anti-apoptotic PI3K/
Akt pathway [15], and emerging evidence suggests a role
in DNA repair [19-21]. The role of PTEN in the regulation
of RAD51 remains controversial [24]. However, a number
of recent studies provide compelling evidence that nuclear
PTEN may have essential roles in DNA repair [40, 41],
and that PTEN deficiency may be targeted in a synthetic
lethality approach by inhibitors of SSBR [24]. Our
primary hypothesis is that this synthetic lethality approach
may be applied to PTEN-deficient melanomas using BER
inhibitors such as those targeting APE1. We initially

investigated the clinicopathological significance of PTEN
mRNA and APE1 mRNA in melanoma. Low PTEN was
associated with poor survival overall but the effect was
absent in BRAF and NRAS-mutated tumours, and only
statistically significant in tumours without BRAF or NRAS
mutations. This may be related to the complex tumoursuppressing function of PTEN, including its roles as a
negative regulator of the anti-apoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway
and in DNA repair regulation. That the influence of PTEN
expression on prognosis was more pronounced in tumours
without BRAF or NRAS mutations is a new observation,
and suggests that PTEN loss may be a key biomarker in
BRAF-wildtype tumours. Taken together, the clinical
data are consistent with pre-clinical study that implicates
PTEN loss in melanoma progression [26]; however, the
relatively small patient numbers in the various subgroups
is a limitation of our study. Our finding that high APE1
mRNA is associated with poor survival in melanoma is
supported by previous studies [42] and provides additional
evidence for targeting APE1 in melanoma.

The success of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-deficient
breast and ovarian tumours [13, 14] implies that a
synthetic lethality approach may be an attractive strategy
in melanomas with DSB repair deficiency. PTENdeficient melanoma cells with defective DSB repair may
be reliant upon BER as a frontline defence to prevent
damage accumulation, replication fork collapse, DSB
formation and consequent cell death. Thus, blockade of
BER through APE1 inhibition could lead to synthetic
lethality in PTEN-deficient cells. To test this hypothesis,
we first profiled PTEN-deficient and PTEN-proficient
melanoma cells for DNA repair factor expression, finding
that expression of several genes involved in HR was
impaired at protein and mRNA level in PTEN-deficient
cells. In addition we observed downregulation of genes
involved in NHEJ, NER, MMR and MGMT. Given the
role of PTEN in the regulation of HR expression as well
as in HR recruitment to sites of DNA damage [19-21],
it is perhaps not surprising that genomic instability in
PTEN-null cells may, over a period of time, eventually

PTEN-deficient melanoma cells were shown in
the current study to be sensitive to APE1 inhibitors.
Similar hypersensitivity observed following exposure to
the PARP inhibitor NU1025 is consistent with previous
observations using PTEN-deficient colorectal cells [24].
We have concluded that the interrelationship between
BER and PTEN may be a valid therapeutic target in
melanoma for the following reasons: a) PTEN-deficient
cells are sensitive to APE1 repair domain inhibitors; b)
PTEN-deficient cells are sensitive to methoxyamine,
an indirect inhibitor of APE1; c) PTEN-deficient cells
are sensitive to the PARP inhibitor NU1025; and d)
upon APE1 inhibitor treatment, PTEN-deficient cells
accumulate DNA DSBs, resulting in the induction of
apoptosis. It should be noted that the observed level of
apoptosis in PTEN-deficient cells following inhibitor
exposure is lower than may be predicted from survival
analyses using clonogenic assays. Although apoptotic cell
accumulation may occur over a period of time following

lead to acquisition of new defects in other DNA repair
pathways. Recent studies that positively link PTEN
with NER [43], MMR [44], and MGMT expression
[45] suggests that such a mechanism may be operating
in cells, but detailed mechanistic studies are required to
confirm this hypothesis. An interesting observation across
PTEN-deficient cell lines was the loss of BRCA1 protein
expression, consistent with previous evidence in UACC62
melanoma cells (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/
projects/cosmic/). This observation is also consistent with
a recent study in breast cancer, wherein high frequency
of PTEN loss was observed in BRCA1-associated breast
tumours [46]. In a separate study, PTEN loss was found to
be a predictor of BRCA1 germ-line mutations in women
with early onset breast cancer [47]. Taken together, this
evidence suggests a possible functional link between
PTEN and BRCA1 in melanomas. These observations,
however, require detailed mechanistic studies to confirm
functional interactions between PTEN and BRCA1.

chronic exposure to APE1 inhibitor, another possible
explanation is ‘synthetic sickness’, a synthetic lethal-type
relationship wherein the overall outcome is reduced fitness
rather than cellular lethality [48]. Accumulation of DNA
damage, including specific DSB accumulation, has been
associated with the induction of cellular senescence [49].
More recently, PTEN loss has also been shown to induce
a senescent phenotype [50]. Therefore we speculate that
DSB accumulation in PTEN-deficient cells following
APE1 inhibition, besides induction of apoptosis, may also
drive the cell population into senescence, contributing to
reduced clonogenicity. Although further study is required
to assess for definitive evidence of senescence induction
in this setting, our data raise the intriguing possibility of a
future avenue for pro-senescence therapy.
In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence
that blockage of BER by APE1 inhibition has attractive
potential for a novel therapeutic approach in PTENdeficient melanomas. This strategy could have significant
translational applications for personalised therapy in
melanoma patients.

In stratified analysis, Cox proportional hazard model was
applied on dichotomized PTEN expression stratifying on
presence of BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations and no
mutations.

melanoma cell lines were chosen for the pre-clinical
study. MeWo is a BRAF wildtype and NRAS wildtype
melanoma cell line. SkMel28, HT144 and UACC62
are BRAF V600 mutant and NRAS wildtype melanoma

5’-GGAAAGAATCAAGGAGG-3’, Loughborough, UK).
Lentiviral production was performed per the supplied
protocol using the Lenti-X high-titer lentiviral packaging
system in Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech, Mountain View,
USA). After 48 hours incubation, lentivirus-containing
supernatant was harvested and applied to MeWo cells at an
MOI of 1 or 3. Once stable in culture, puromycin selection
was initiated at a concentration of 1μg/ml. To induce
shRNA expression, doxycycline was added to culture
medium at a concentration of 0.5-1μg/ml and replaced
every 72 hours. Confirmation of reduced transcript
production by qRT-PCR was performed on an Applied
Biosystems 7500 FAST cycler using Qiagen PCR primers
against PTEN [Qiagen Quantitect primers (HS_PTEN_4_
SG and HS_GAPDH_1_SG)]. Absence of PTEN protein
expression was confirmed on Western blot.

METHODS
Clinical study
Gene expression analysis: Whole genome gene
expression (~30,000 probes) was measured using
Illumina DASL approach in 240 formalin fixed primary
melanoma tumours from Leeds Melanoma Cohort [31],
including 29 duplicates to serve in QC checks. After
QC, the cohort contained 191 patients including 106
who had relapsed and 101 who had died. Histology data
were derived from clinical histopathology reports. For a
subset of tumors diagnostic H+E slides were reviewed
by a dermatopathologist (Dr Andy Boon (Cohort study)
to standardize reporting across the specimens. BRAF and
NRAS mutation status was also available for 182 of these
tumours, derived using pyrosequencing as previously
described [32]. The study was approved by the National
Research ethics committee (UK).

qRT-PCR analysis of DNA repair gene expression
in melanoma cell lines
RNA was extracted from melanoma cell lines using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified using a
microvolume spectrophotometer. cDNA synthesis was
performed using the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). Real
time PCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems
75000 FAST cycler in a commercially available 96-well
plate format, allowing assessment of 88 DNA repair
genes simultaneously (RT2 Profiler DNA Repair PCR
Array). Threshold cycle was calculated for each well and
exported to online software for further analysis (www.
SABiosciences.com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php).
All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

Statistical analyses
Data was normalised using background correction
and robust spline smoothing with Lumi R package. The
associations between PTEN and APE1 mRNA expressions
and histological factors were assessed using linear and
logistic regression of log2 transformed gene expression
data. Separate and joint effects of PTEN and APE1
mRNA expressions on relapse-free and overall survival
was tested. Expression data were used as continuous
after log2 transformation and after dichotomisation using
expression cut-offs determined using X-Tile software [33].

violet in 70% aqueous ethanol to allow quantification
of colony number. All experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Primary antibody details are summarised in
Supplementary Table S4. Protein expression was
examined by infrared dye-labelled secondary antibody
(Li-Cor, 1:15000 dilution) detected by Li-Cor Odyssey
Scanner. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Aldehyde Reactive Probe (ARP) assay
Cell-based ARP assay was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Abcam). Cells were plated
at high density in a 96-well plate, allowed to grow for 24
hours, then treated with inhibitor. Results were presented
as percent increase in fluorescence as a surrogate for AP
site accumulation.

APE1 inhibitors and other compounds
We have previously identified a number of
APE1 inhibitors. [34, 35] Cell biology experiments
performed here utilised structural analogues of N-(4fluorophenyl)-2-[4-phenylsulfonyl-2-(p-tolyl)oxazol-5yl]sulfanyl-acetamide (previously characterised in [12]:
N-(4-fluorophenyl) -2- (2-phenyl-4- phenylsulfonyl-1,3oxazol-5-yl]sulfanyl-acetamide (Inhibitor-1) and N-(4fluorophenyl)-2-(2-phenyl-4-phenylsulfonyl-oxazol5-yl)sulfanyl-acetamide (Inhibitor-2), purchased from
ChemDiv. Additional inhibitors previously identified
by Rai et al. [35] were synthesised by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) Chemical Genomics Center
(NCGC):
N-(3-(benzo[d]-thiazol-2-yl)-6-isopropyl4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-c]-pyridin-2-yl)acetamide
(Inhibitor-3) and its analogue N-(3-(benzo[d]thiazol-2yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-thieno[2,3-c]pyrrol-2-yl)acetamide
(Inhibitor-4). APE1 inhibitors investigated here are
highly potent and specific for APE1. They do not bind to
DNA and have no activity against E. coli endonuclease
IV (a functional homolog with no sequence or structural
homology to APE1). IC50 for APE1 endonuclease activity
inhibiton in purified protein fluoresence based biochemical
assays are as follows; inhibitor 1= 0.2µM, inhibitor 2=
0.1µM , inhibitor 3= 2µM and inhibitor 4=3.3µM . The
compounds also block AP site cleavage activity in HeLa
whole cell extract assays, and potentiate the cytotoxicity
of alkylating agents in cancer cell lines [34, 35]. Molecular
modelling studies indicate that these APE1 inhibitors dock
onto the active site of APE1 [8, 34]. Methoxyamine, a
non-specific indirect inhibitor of APE1, binds irreversibly
to AP sites in DNA [36] and prevents APE1 (and
endonuclease IV) from processing the adducted AP lesion.
Methoxyamine (indirect APE1 inhibitor) was purchased
from Sigma. NU1025 (PARP inhibitor) was purchased
from Tocris Bioscience.

Neutral COMET assay
Cell lines were plated into 6cm petridishes at a
density of 105 cells per plate. Cells were allowed to adhere
for 24 hours, after which time inhibitory compound was
added at a single concentration. Cells were harvested at 0,
2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hour time points, and neutral COMET
assay was performed as described previously [12]. All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

γH2AX immunocytochemistry
Cell lines were seeded onto sterile coverslips in
6-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well. Cells were
allowed to adhere for 24 hours, after which time inhibitory
compound was added. After 24 hours exposure, γH2AX
immunocytochemistry was performed [12]. The number
of γH2AX foci per nucleus was determined in 100 cells
per slide. Nuclei containing more than 6 γH2AX foci were
considered positive. All experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Apoptosis detection by FITC-annexin V flow
cytometric analysis
Cell lines were plated into 6-well plates at a
density of 5 x 105 cells per well. Cells were allowed
to adhere for 24 hours, after which time inhibitory
compound was added. After 24 hours exposure, cells were
gently trypsinised, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and
resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer (FITC Annexin
V Apoptosis Detection Kit I, BD Pharmingen). Cells
were incubated for 15 minutes in the dark with FITCAnnexin V and propidium iodide (PI), then analysed by
flow cytometry using a BC Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer.
The percentage of induced apoptosis (FITC-Annexin
V positive, PI negative and FITC-Annexin V positive,
PI positive) was determined by comparison to a control
population of untreated cells. All experiments were
performed in triplicate [12].

Clonogenic survival assay
Cell lines were plated into 6-well plates at a density
of 200-400 cells per well. Cells were allowed to adhere
for 4 hours, after which inhibitory compound was added at
varying concentrations. Cells were incubated for 14 days
under normal incubator conditions. After this time, media
was discarded and cells were stained using 10% crystal
