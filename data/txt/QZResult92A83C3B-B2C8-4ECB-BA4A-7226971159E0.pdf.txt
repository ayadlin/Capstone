BACKGROUND. Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a cephalotaxus alkaloid that inhibits
the synthesis of proteins leading to apoptosis. Intravenous HHT has demonstrated activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after failure
with interferon.
METHODS. A Phase I study was completed of subcutaneous (s.c.) HHT in patients
with CML in accelerated or blast phases and demonstrated efficacy and good tolerance at the same doses used by intravenous (i.v.) administration. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was 1.25 mg/m2 s.c. twice daily. The cohort was then expanded to
treated at the MTD to include patients in late chronic phase CML after imatinib failure. Therapy consisted of an i.v. loading dose of HHT 2.5 mg/m2 over 24 hours, followed by 1.25 mg/m2 s.c. twice daily for 14 days every 28 days until remission, then for
7 days every 28 days. Six patients (median age, 53 years) who had failed imatinib were
treated and 5 were evaluable. Patients received a median of 4.5 courses of s.c. HHT.

RESULTS. Complete hematologic remission was obtained in all 5 evaluable patients
and 3 had cytogenetic (CG) responses: 1 complete and 2 minor. The 2 patients with
BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations at the start of therapy with HHT had a CG
response and in both instances the mutations became undetectable. All patients
developed myelosuppression and 3 had their HHT dose reduced due to prolonged
neutropenia. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and manageable.

CONCLUSIONS. Subcutaneous HHT is well tolerated and may have clinical activity in
patients with CML after imatinib failure. Cancer 2007;109:248–55.

matinib (Gleevec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) has caused a paradigm shift in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML). By selectively inhibiting the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in CML
leukemic cells, imatinib induces complete cytogenetic (CG) responses in 40% to 60% of patients in chronic phase (CP) postfailure
of therapy with interferon (IFN)-a1,2 and in 80% to 90% of previously
untreated patients.3–5 Response rates in more advanced stages of
CML are significantly lower and responses are of shorter duration.6–9
In addition, some patients who respond well to imatinib may eventually develop resistance through 1 of several mechanisms of resistance that have been reported, including mutations of the Bcr-Abl
kinase domain, amplification and overexpression of Bcr-Abl, and
overexpression of other kinases.10–12 Therefore, despite the outstanding results obtained with imatinib therapy, there is a subset of
patients with CML for whom new therapeutic strategies are needed.

Subcutaneous HHT for CML/Quintás-Cardama et al.

Homoharringtonine (cephalotaxine, 4-methy-2hydroxy-4-methylpentyl butanedioate) (HHT) is a
cephalotaxus alkaloid obtained by alcoholic extraction
from the evergreen tree Cephalotaxus harringtonia k.
koch var harringtonia. HHT has shown activity against
myeloid leukemias by inhibiting protein synthesis,
promoting cell differentiation, and inducing apoptosis
via a caspase-3-dependent mechanism.13–15 A racemic
mixture of harringtonine (HHT minus a methylene
group) and HHT was first used in China for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and CML
in the 1970s.16,17 Until the advent of imatinib, HHT
was the most effective agent for treatment of patients
with CML after IFN-a failure.18,19 Treatment with
HHT in late-phase CML after IFN-a failure was associated with a complete hematologic response (CHR)
rate of 72% and a CG response rate of 31% (complete
CG response [Ph 0%] in 15% of patients).18 In vitro
studies showing synergy of HHT with ara-C and IFNa20 led to clinical trials of combinations of HHT and
low-dose Ara-C,21 IFN-a,19,22 or both.23
With the introduction of imatinib the focus for
HHT development has shifted to investigate its potential to overcome resistance to imatinib. Recently, HHT
has been shown to have a synergistic or additive effect
with imatinib in vitro against imatinib-resistant cell
lines24–26 and against cells from patients with CML in
blastic phase.24 Clinical studies with HHT have typically used a formulation administered by intravenous
(i.v.) infusion in a continuous fashion over 14 days,
which greatly reduced the cardiovascular toxicity seen
with bolus infusion. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration would make the administration of HHT more
convenient for patients, provided it had a similar
safety and clinical profile when administered by this
route. Therefore, we designed a Phase I/II trial to
investigate the safety and efficacy of s.c. HHT in the
treatment of CML patients after failure to imatinib
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Requirements
Patients age 12 years or older with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML in CP, accelerated (AP), or
blast phase (BP) were eligible. Patients in early CP
CML (time from diagnosis to therapy less than 12
months) were not eligible and those in late CP were
eligible only after the maximal tolerated dose (MTD)
or level 3 (whichever came first) was reached. In addition, patients in late CP were eligible only if they had
failed imatinib therapy, whereas these prior treatment
restrictions did not apply to patients in AP or BP.
Other eligibility criteria included: 1) life expectancy

249

sufficiently long to fully evaluate the effects of at least
2 courses of chemotherapy; 2) performance status 2
or less by the Zubrod scale; 3) adequate hepatic and
renal function (ie, bilirubin and creatinine < 2.0 mg/
dL); and 4) adequate cardiac status (New York Heart
Association class <II). Women who were pregnant or
breast-feeding were excluded because of potential
harmful effects of HHT on developing fetuses and
newborns. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients in accordance with institutional
guidelines.

Treatment Plan
HHT was supplied by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) as a white crystalline lyophilized powder
in 5-mg vials for injection and stored at room temperature (22–258C). It was then reconstituted with 2.5 mL
of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP (final concentration, 2 mg HHT/mL).
Remission induction therapy
The initial course consisted of HHT 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours on Day 1, then s.c.
twice daily for 13 days. Subsequent courses of induction consisted of 14 days of s.c. HHT twice daily every
month. HHT was administered at 1 of the following
dose levels: 0.5 (level 0), 1.0 (level þ1) and 1.25 (level
þ2) mg/m2 in a ‘3þ3’ Phase I design. The latter dose
level is the same used i.v. in prior studies of HHT in
CML and, thus, no further dose escalation was pursued beyond that level. Patients who failed to obtain
at least a partial hematologic response (PHR) after 2
courses were taken off study. Those who obtained at
least a PHR but developed grade III or IV nonhematologic toxicity continued to receive HHT s.c. for 10 days
every month. The use of hydroxyurea and anagrelide
was temporarily allowed for patients with leukocytosis
30  109/L or thrombocytosis 700  109/L.
Remission maintenance
Patients who achieved a CHR received maintenance
therapy with HHT s.c. (same dose in mg/m2 as during
induction) twice daily for 7 days every month for up
to 3 years. Subsequent courses were adjusted by 61
day to achieve a lowest granulocyte count of about
1  109/L and a lowest platelet count >50  109/L
with each course. Should extramedullary toxicity due
to HHT occur (specifically headache, diarrhea, mucositis, or cardiovascular) the daily dose was reduced by
25% for grade II toxicity and by 50% for grade III or IV
toxicity. Courses were given at monthly intervals provided the neutrophil count had recovered to >1.5 
109/L and the platelet count to >80  109/L. Subse-

quent courses could be started earlier than 28 days if
counts had recovered above these levels provided
there had been no grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity in the prior course. Treatment with s.c. HHT was
discontinued 1) if unacceptable (grade 3–4) toxicity
occurred in the absence of significant antileukemic
effect; 2) if a patient in CP developed AP or BP while
on study; 3) if patients showed a steady increase in
white blood cell count (WBC) in peripheral blood
(>40  109/L or a 25% increase in WBC for patients
beginning with WBC >40  109/L) while receiving
HHT at the highest tolerated dose; or 4) on patient
request.

Response and Toxicity Criteria
Response criteria were as previously described.2,27
Briefly, CHR was defined as normalization for at least
4 weeks of the bone marrow (less than 5% blasts) and
peripheral blood with WBC <10  109/L, with no peripheral blasts or promyelocytes, less than 5% myelocytes plus metamyelocytes, and platelets <450  109/L
in the absence of hydroxyurea or anagrelide. This is in
addition to disappearance of signs and symptoms of
disease, including palpable splenomegaly. CHR was
further categorized according to the degree of Ph suppression as follows: no CG response, >95% Ph-positive metaphases; minor CG response (mCyR), 35% to
95% Ph-positive metaphases; partial CG response
(PCyR), 1% to 34% Ph-positive metaphases; complete
CG response (CCyR), 0% Ph-positive metaphases.
Major CG response (MCyR) was defined as the sum of
complete plus partial CG responses. The evaluation of
CG response was judged by standard CG analysis. Partial hematologic remission (PHR) was defined as CHR
except for persistence of immature peripheral cells
and/or persistent splenomegaly or thrombocytosis
(>450  109/L) but at least 50% less than pretreatment. All other responses were considered failures.
Toxicities were graded according to the NCI Common
Toxicity Criteria (v. 2.0). Duration of remission was
measured from the date remission was obtained to
the date recurrence was documented. Survival was
calculated from the time the treatment began until
death from any cause or last follow-up.
Evaluation
Complete peripheral blood counts (CBC) and differential were performed every 4 to 7 days during remission
induction chemotherapy and at least once every week
during maintenance therapy. Bone marrow aspirate
and CG studies were performed every 3 to 4 months to
evaluate CG response. Biochemistries were done every
2 weeks during induction, then every 2 to 6 weeks.
During the Phase I part of the study and in the first 6

patients treated at the MTD, patients were hospitalized
or monitored in an outpatient 24-hour facility for
cardiovascular side effects for the first cycle of therapy.
After that, patients were evaluated for local reactions
1 day after the start of injections (2 injections given).
They were instructed to call and return earlier (to the
emergency room) if pain, redness, swelling, or tenderness was judged moderate or worse by the patient.

Statistical Considerations
Phase I of the study used a classic ‘3þ3 design.’ For
the first 3 patients the initial dose was 0.5 mg/m2. The
dose was then escalated according to side effects.
MTD was defined as one where 1 of 3 patients
experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was
defined as any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity,
except for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were
considered DLT only if uncontrolled by adequate
symptomatic therapy. One objective of the trial was to
evaluate the efficacy of s.c. HHT for the treatment of
CP CML. The outcome of major interest was achievement of CHR. The CHR rate achieved in a trial of
about 100 patients treated with intravenous HHT is
60%. A Bayesian approach was used to provide a basis
for early termination in the event there was convincing evidence that the CHR rate was unlikely to be
equivalent to the previous regimen. Patient accrual
was to be stopped if there was <10% probability that
the CHR rate associated with the new therapy was at
least equivalent to the previous regimen. Results were
to be analyzed after every 10 patients were entered.
Analysis was to be stopped if the following numbers
of responses were observed among the total entered:
 3 of 10, 8 of 20, 13 of 30.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From January 2000 to August 2004, 17 patients were
treated with s.c. HHT: 11 in Phase I and 6 in Phase II
of the trial (Tables 1, 2). The median age was 54 years
(range, 30–78 years) and their median time from diagnosis to treatment was 31 months (range, 2–176
months). Among the 11 patients treated in Phase I, 8
had BP, 2 had AP, and 1 late CP at study entry. All but 1
of these patients (Patient 8) had Ph-positive bone
marrow metaphases in all cells analyzed. All had
received prior therapy, with a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 2–5). These included imatinib (n ¼ 7),
IFN-a (n ¼ 6), troxacytabine (n ¼ 3), decitabine (n ¼ 1),
farnesyl transferase inhibitors (n ¼ 1), and allogeneic
bone marrow transplantation (n ¼ 1).
Three patients were treated at the lowest dose
level (0.5 mg/m2 twice daily) receiving 1 cycle each

and none experienced any nonhematologic toxicity.
Three patients were treated at 1.0 mg/m2 twice daily
(1 cycle each) and 5 patients received 1.25 mg/m2
twice daily (1 cycle in 2 patients, 2 cycles in 1 patient,
and 3 cycles in 1 patient). Per protocol design the latter dose was deemed to be the Phase II dose. Overall,
patients received a median of 1 cycle of therapy
(range, 1–5 cycles). The main objective of the study,
once the Phase II dose was reached, was to investigate
the efficacy of s.c. HHT in patients in late CP CML after imatinib failure. Six patients were accrued in Phase
II of this study. Of them, 5 were evaluable for toxicity
and response, whereas 1 patient was lost to follow-up.
All 5 evaluable patients had late CP CML with 100%
Ph-positive metaphases at study entry and failed a
median of 5 therapies (range, 1–9) including: imatinib
(n ¼ 5), IFN-a-based therapies (n ¼ 5), Ara-C (n ¼ 2),
and farnesyl transferase inhibitors (n ¼ 2). Patients
had been treated with imatinib for a median of 64
weeks (range, 12–96). Three patients had received a
maximum dose of 800 mg daily and the remaining 2
had been treated with 400 mg daily. The best response
to imatinib achieved by these patients was as follows:
CHR (n ¼ 3), complete CG response (n ¼ 2), and primary resistance (n ¼ 1). The median number of HHT
cycles for the 5 evaluable patients was 4.5 (range, 1–5
cycles).

Response
The median baseline peripheral blood (PB) WBC of
the 11 patients enrolled in the Phase I portion of the
study was 19.6  109/L. After the start of s.c. HHT, the
median best PB WBC count was 5.4  109/L. WBC
improvements were documented in 9 patients and
were greater than 50% in 7 of them (Patients 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, and 11). Likewise, 9 patients improved PB blast
counts, with a reduction greater than 50% in 8 of
them (Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12), and 5
improved PB basophil counts, 4 of them achieving

reductions greater than 50%. Among the 5 patients
treated at the highest dose level (1.25 mg/m2 twice
daily), 4 (Patients 8, 9, 10, and 11) had significant
reductions in PB WBC and 1 (Patient 7) maintained
her WBC within a normal range. Also, in 3 of these 5
patients blasts disappeared from the PB (Patients 8,
10, and 11). Two patients (Patients 8 and 11) had
reductions of PB basophil percentages from 38% and
9%, respectively, to 0% and 1 (Patient 9) had a reduction from 4% to 2%.
All the patients with late CP CML enrolled in the
Phase II part of the study (n ¼ 6) had lost their CHR
before the start of therapy with s.c. HHT. All 5 evaluable patients achieved CHR on s.c. HHT and were
started on maintenance after 2 cycles of induction
therapy (Table 3). The median duration of hematologic
responses was 12 weeks (range, 11–23) and 2 patients
(Patients 16 and 17) were still in CHR at the time they
were taken off study. In addition, 1 patient achieved a
complete CG response (Patient 15) and 3 a minor CG
response (Patients 12, 16, and 17, with lowest Ph 90%,
80%, and 90%, respectively). The 1 patient who
achieved a complete CG response had been primary
refractory to imatinib therapy. The median duration of
CG responses was 2 months (range, 1–4 months).
Screening for the presence of mutations of the BcrAbl tyrosine kinase domain was performed in all
patients. Mutations were identified at study entry in 2
patients: Patient 12 presented 2 mutations, G250E and
Y253H, and Patient 15 had an F359I mutation. Both
patients had CG responses, 1 minor and 1 complete,
respectively. Patients received a median of 4.5 courses
of s.c. HHT (range, 1–5). The patient who achieved a
complete CG response harbored the Bcr-Abl F359I
mutant at the start of HHT therapy. Interestingly, this
patient developed extramedullary blastic disease
(multifocal skeletal granulocytic sarcomas) that required radiotherapy while remaining in complete CG
response in peripheral blood and bone marrow.

Unfortunately, after the sixth patient was treated the
drug became unavailable from the sponsor and the
study had to be stopped prematurely despite meeting
the criteria per the statistical design for continuation
of accrual.

Toxicity
A total of 40 cycles were administered to 17 patients.
The median time between cycles was 29 days (range,
19–84), and 2 patients required dose reductions in
subsequent cycles.
The most frequent grade 1–2 nonhematologic
toxicities experienced in the Phase I part of the study
were diarrhea (n ¼ 7), nausea (n ¼ 6), fatigue (n ¼ 5),
hypokalemia (n ¼ 3), and edema (n ¼ 3). Local reactions at injection site, myalgias, hyperbilirubinemia,
and vomiting occurred in 2 patients each. In the majority of cases these side effects were mild and did not
prevent the administration of s.c. HHT. Grade 3–4
nonhematologic side effects consisted of myalgias
(n ¼ 2) and fatigue (n ¼ 2). Hematologic toxicity was
dose-related and more frequent in patients treated
with 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily. Grade 3–4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were recorded in 8,
4, and 5 patients, respectively. Two patients were hospitalized for neutropenic fever. No deaths related to
neutropenia and sepsis occurred.
In the Phase II portion of the study all 5 evaluable
patients developed myelosuppression. Three had
grade 3 neutropenia (Patients 12, 15, and 17) and 2
grade 4 (Patients 13 and 16). This was prolonged (median duration 8 weeks, range 7–9 weeks) in 3, requiring delays in administration of HHT and dose
reductions upon resumption of therapy. Anemia and
thrombocytopenia grade 3–4 occurred in 3 patients
each. No bleeding episodes occurred. Grade 3–4 nonhematologic toxicity included neutropenic fever (n ¼ 1),
nonneutropenic fever (n ¼ 1), and fatigue (n ¼ 1).
Injection site reactions (grade 1–2) occurred in 2 patients and were mild and transient. In addition, patients had transient or self-limited episodes of nausea
(n ¼ 4), vomiting (n ¼ 3), diarrhea (n ¼ 4), weakness
(n ¼ 5), edema (n ¼ 2), headache (n ¼ 2), or pruritus
(n ¼ 2), which were grade 1 or 2 in all instances. No
patient discontinued therapy because of toxicity and
there were no treatment-related deaths.

DISCUSSION
The main goal of this study was to establish the MTD
of s.c. HHT and assess its efficacy for the treatment of
patients with CML after imatinib failure. HHT, alone
or in combination with IFN-a and/or ara-C, has
shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of CML.18–20

253

Triple therapy with HHT, IFN-a, and ara-C was associated with CHR and complete CG response rates of
94% and 22%, respectively, in patients with CML in
early CP.23 These results established the clinical efficacy of HHT in CML. With the advent of imatinib, the
focus of HHT development has changed to patients
having suboptimal response to imatinib or failing
imatinib.
HHT has been suggested to have synergistic activity with imatinib in CML cell lines.24–26 In a recent
study, 13 patients with CML who had achieved a partial or complete CG response on imatinib had s.c.
HHT at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for 1 day every 28 days added to their ongoing imatinib therapy.
Of 10 evaluable patients, 5 had their BCR-ABL transcript levels reduced by more than 1-log.28 The efficacy of HHT after imatinib failure has not yet been
investigated. In the present trial we aimed to develop
an effective s.c. schedule of HHT to explore the efficacy of longer exposures to the drug and minimizing
side effects. Eleven patients (10 of them with advancedstage CML) received escalating doses of s.c. HHT. The
MTD was established at 1.25 mg/m2 (given twice daily
for 14 days every month), which is the same dose
used i.v. using HHT in a low-dose continuous infusion
schedule. We did not try higher doses of HHT than
the one used i.v., as this dose has been well tolerated
in prior studies using the i.v. route. The pharmacokinetics of s.c. HHT are very similar to those observed
with continuous i.v. administration of HHT.29 In addition, in animal studies doses higher than those used
i.v. resulted in excessive toxicity. Thus, we made no
attempt at escalating the dose beyond that used i.v. in
previous studies in patients with CML. In the present
trial there was some suggestion of clinical activity
with reductions greater than 50% in PB blasts and
basophils obtained in 72% and 36% of patients,
respectively, with no significant toxicity. There were
no responses by standard criteria, but most patients
received only 1 cycle of therapy, particularly those
treated at the lower doses. The predefined MTD was
then used to treat 6 patients with CML in chronic
phase who had failed imatinib. All 5 evaluable
patients achieved CHR and, importantly, 4 of them
had some degree of CG response. Nonhematologic
toxicity was common but mild to moderate. The main
side effect was neutropenia in 4 of 5 evaluable
patients. In view of the frequent delays in delivering
the cycles every 28 days, lower doses and/or greater
intervals between courses may need to be explored in
future studies of s.c. HHT.
In spite of the outstanding results obtained with
imatinib therapy in CML, resistance to the drug
ensues in an important proportion of patients through

various mechanisms (mutations in BCR-ABL, BCRABL amplification, Bcr-Abl overexpression, or expression of Src-related kinases). Abl kinase domain mutations have been reported in 30% to 50% of patients
with CML who fail single-agent imatinib therapy.11,30
Although in some cases the expansion of some mutant clones may simply be due to selective imatinib
pressure and therefore may not have clinical significance, some Abl kinase mutations have been associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance and
aggressive clinical behavior. In the latter setting, the
use of agents whose mechanism of action is independent of the configuration of the Abl kinase such as
HHT may be particularly appealing. In the present
study both patients with detectable mutations of the
Abl kinase domain responded to s.c. HHT. Patient 12
presented with 2 different mutations before study
entry: G250E and the highly imatinib-resistant Y253H
(IC50 >5000 nmol/L).31 Both mutations disappeared 1
month after s.c. HHT was started and shortly thereafter this patient achieved a minor CG response. This
patient eventually lost response associated with recurrence of the Y253F mutation. Patient 15 had mutation
F359I at study entry, and it became undetectable after
4 months on s.c. HHT. This was associated with clinical
response. Unfortunately, he then developed multifocal
extramedullary skeletal blast disease requiring radiotherapy while maintaining a complete CG response in
both PB and bone marrow. Because the mechanism of
action of HHT is independent of configuration of the
Abl kinase, probably including inhibition of transcription of Bcr-Abl,32 it is conceivable that it might have activity against Abl kinase domain mutants. Indeed, there
is preliminary evidence to suggest activity against the
T315I mutation that is highly resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib.33 In this study, HHT decreased the
total protein level of Bcr-Abl Ba/F3 cells transfected
with either wildtype Bcr-Abl or Bcr-Abl with the Abl
kinase domain mutations E255K or T315I, and hence
its kinase activity. In addition, cells transfected with
the mutated Bcr-Abl were equally sensitive to HHT
as those with wildtype Bcr-Abl in clonogenic assays,
with an IC50 of 127 to 232 nM for all cell lines. Further
confirmation of the clinical activity observed in this
trial, including in patients with the T315I mutation, is
warranted.
In summary, the data from this trial demonstrate
that therapy with HHT administered s.c. has an acceptable toxicity profile and clinical activity in
patients with CML after imatinib failure. Importantly,
its clinical benefit seems to be independent of the
presence of mutations in the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase
domain, thus offering a potential therapeutic alternative for this patient population.
