BACKGROUND: The presence of vascular invasion in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) correlates with prognosis,
and is a critical determinant of both the therapeutic approach and the recurrence or intrahepatic metastases. The authors sought to identify candidate therapeutic agents capable of targeting the invasive phenotype in HCC. METHODS: A gene expression signature associated with vascular invasion derived from
81 human cases of HCC was used to screen a database of 453 genomic profiles associated with 164 bioactive molecules using the connectivity map. Candidate agents were identified by their inverse correlation
to the query gene signature. The efficacy of the candidate agents to target invasion was experimentally
verified in PLC/PRF-5 and HepG2 HCC cells. RESULTS: The gene signature associated with vascular
invasion in HCC comprised of 47 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated genes. Computational bioinformatics analysis revealed several putative candidates, including resveratrol and 17-allylamino-geldanamycin
(17-AAG). Both of these agents reduced HCC cell invasion at noncytotoxic concentrations. 17-AAG, a
heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90) inhibitor, was shown to modulate the expression of several diverse cancerassociated genes, including ADAMTS1, part of the query signature, and maspin, an HSP-90–associated protein with a tumor suppressor role in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Candidates for further evaluation as therapies to
limit invasion in HCC have been identified using a computational bioinformatics analysis of phenotypeassociated gene expression. Phenotype targeting using genomic profiling is a rational approach for drug
discovery. Therapeutic strategies targeting a defined cancer-associated phenotype can be identified

poor.2 There remains a need for more effective therapies
for HCC. Clinical outcomes for HCC reflect the treatment approaches selected, which depend partly on the
presence of vascular invasion and on residual liver function.3 Moreover, vascular invasion is an accurate prognostic factor.4,5 The presence of vascular invasion portends
local and distant tumor spread, resulting in satellite nodules, multifocal tumors, and intrahepatic metastases. The
presence of either macroscopic or microscopic vascular
invasion contributes to the high rate of relapse and limits
the value of hepatic resections or locoregional therapies
for HCC.6,7 Treatment strategies targeting vascular invasion would be extremely valuable in the therapeutic armamentarium for HCC.
Genomic profiling studies in HCC have identified
expression profiles that correlate with specific phenotypic
features of HCC, such as vascular invasion,8 recurrence,9,10 differentiation,11 stage, or metastatic potential.8,12 Thus, transcriptional profiles can recapitulate
essential elements associated with a specific tumor phenotype. We sought to use gene expression profiles associated
with vascular invasion to identify small molecules with
therapeutic potential for HCC. Our studies demonstrate
the feasibility of this in silico approach using phenotypebased gene-expression profiling for drug discovery and
identify novel potential therapeutic agents capable of
targeting the invasive phenotype in HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
The human hepatocellular cancer cell lines HepG2 and
PLC/PRF-5 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, Va) and were cultured in
minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% antimycotic/antibiotic mix. Normal
human hepatocytes were obtained from Sciencell (San
Diego, Calif) and cultured in hepatocyte medium with
5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin mix, and 1% hepatocyte growth serum (Sciencell).

were obtained from the Stanford Microarray Database
(http://smd.stanford.edu).8 We queried the SOURCE system (http://source.stanford.edu/) using the clone IDs
reported by Chen et al8 to obtain genetic and molecular
data for each gene, which were then used to obtain Affymetrix (HG-U133A) probe IDs (https://www.affymetrix.
com/analysis/netaffx). Our query signature consisted of 73
genes whose expression was significantly correlated with
vascular invasion in HCC. This set was used to query the
connectivity map dataset (http://www.broad.mit.edu/
cmap). The dataset comprises genomic profiling data from
453 treatment-control pairs (instances) involving 164 bioactive molecules (perturbagens). A gene set enrichment
metric based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to rank
order individual treatment instances by their similarity to
the vascular invasion signature was used.13 The output consisted of a group of chemical perturbagens with a connectivity score ranging from þ1 and 1. The score represented
the correlation between the query signature profile and the
gene profile of a treatment-control pair (instance). A high
positive connectivity score indicated that the corresponding
perturbagen induced the expression of the query signature,
whereas a high negative connectivity score indicated reversal of expression of the query signature by the perturbagen.
A zero or ‘‘null’’ connectivity score indicated that no effect
upon expression of the query signature was recorded. A permuted analysis was performed to estimate the likelihood
that the enrichment of all instances of each perturbagen in
the list would be observed by chance, and a P value was
derived.13 Candidate agents for further study were chosen
on the basis of the connectivity score and P value.

Cytotoxicity Assay
Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous
assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wis). Cells (10,000/well)
were plated in 96-well plates (BD Biosciences, Rockville,
Md) and incubated at 37 C overnight. After 6 hours of
serum starvation, drugs were added at various concentrations, and cell viability was assessed after 24 hours as previously described.14

Swarm mouse tumor (ECM) using the QCM 96-well cell
invasion assay kit (Chemicon International, Temecula,
Calif). Cells were first serum-starved for 24 hours and
then plated (100,000 cells/well) in serum-free medium
containing the test agents in the top chamber of a 96-well
plate. An insert with an 8-lm pore size polycarbonate
membrane coated with a thin layer of ECM separated the
top from the bottom chamber of the plate. Medium containing 10% FBS was added to the bottom chamber. Invasion across the basement membrane was assessed after 24
hours. Cells on the bottom of the membrane were dissociated by incubation with detachment buffer and added to
cells that had migrated into the bottom chamber, and
then quantified fluorometrically after staining with
CyQuant GR dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif).

Migration Assay
Cell migration was assessed by using the Oris Cell
Migration assay kit (Platypus Technologies, Madison,
Wis). Briefly, cells were stained with calcein AM (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ) and plated (20,000 cells/well) in a
96-well plate provided with an insert that prevented the
cells from attaching in a central analytic zone. After overnight incubation at 37 C, medium was changed to
serum-free medium containing the compounds, and the
insert was removed to allow cells to migrate into the central zone. The cells that had migrated into the central zone
were quantified fluorometrically by using an appropriate
mask that allowed the reader to detect only the cells in the
central area.

Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction Analysis
For ADAMTS1 and maspin mRNA expression, RNA was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA
was synthesized in 20 lL reaction volume using 5
iScript TM cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Hercules, Calif).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was performed on a MX 3000P PCR Instrument (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif) using SYBR Green as the detection fluorophore, as described previously.15 Forward
and reverse primers used were as follows: ADAMTS1: 50 CCTCTGTCTGTGTGCAAGGA-30 and 50 -GTGGCT
CCAGTTGGAATTGT-30 ; maspin: 50 -GGGCAGCTA
3740

CCTCTCTTGGC-30 and 50 -GTACGGCAATCCTCT
CGGC-30 . PCR parameters were as follows: 10 minutes
at 95 C, then 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 C, then 1
minute at 60 C. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Threshold values were determined for each sample/primer
pair, and average and confidence interval values were
calculated. The PCR products were verified by melting
curve analysis. Gene-specific mRNA expression was normalized against that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or beta-actin. Gene expression
profiling studies were performed using the Human Cancer Pathway Finder PCR array (SuperArray Bioscience,
Frederick, Md) in a single replicate. Twenty-five microliters of a solution containing cDNA, SYBR Green Supermix (Invitrogen), ROX dye (Invitrogen), and distilled
water were loaded in each well of the supplied 96-well
plate, before thermal cycling using a MX3000P PCR
Instrument (Stratagene) at 95 C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds and 60 C for
1 minute. The threshold cycle was defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passed a
fixed threshold.

Chemicals and Reagents
17-Allylamino-geldanamycin (17-AAG) and sorafenib
were obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, Mass)
and diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Resveratrol
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Mo) and
diluted in ethanol. Picropodophyllin (PPP) was purchased from Calbiochem and diluted in DMSO. For all
studies, DMSO and ethanol concentrations were <0.2%.
All reagents obtained were of the highest purity available.

RESULTS
Derivation of Genomic Signature
The ability of hepatocellular cancer cells to invade vascular
structures within or around the liver plays a key role in
tumor spread. We sought to identify therapeutic agents
that could be useful to target vascular invasion based on
the premise that limiting the spread of this tumor would
improve outcomes from locoregional therapies or resection. A genomic signature associated with vascular invasion in HCC was derived from whole genome studies of
Cancer

38 tumors with and 43 without this phenotype.8 From
these data, we selected a 73-gene signature that correlated
with vascular invasion, consisting of 47 genes that were
increased in expression and 26 genes that were decreased
in expression in HCC with vascular invasion (Table 1).

Bioinformatics Analysis and Selection of
Candidate Agents
The gene signature was used to query the connectivity
map. Connectivity scores were computed for 453 treatment-control pairs (instances). We sought instances that
were associated with a highly significant negative score, as
our goal was to identify bioactive compounds that could
reverse the gene changes associated with the phenotype.
Our analysis revealed 233 instances with negative scores
ranging from 1.00 to 0.33, representing 120 different
perturbagens. The 9 agents with highly significant negative scores (P < .05) are shown in Figure 1. From these,
we selected 3 compounds with the lowest P value and that
had multiple correlative instances without any positive
correlations. These candidate agents were resveratrol,
rapamycin, and 17-AAG. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic
component of red wine that has very recently been
reported to inhibit the ability of hepatoma cells to invade
tissue and form metastasis in vivo.16,17 These observations
validate the use of this in silico approach to identify biologically useful agents capable of reverting the phenotype
of interest. Rapamycin is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, and its activity in preventing HCC recurrence has been recently suggested in clinical studies.18 17AAG is a modulator of heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90)
and has shown anticancer activity in human solid
tumors.19 Although 17-AAG has been evaluated as an
antitumor agent, its potential use in HCC is unknown.
Moreover, 17-dimethylamino-geldanamycin, which is
structurally similar to 17-AAG and a modulator of HSP90, was also noted to have a robust negative correlation
with the query signature, thus strengthening the hypothesis that inhibition of HSP-90 might be therapeutically
useful for limiting HCC invasion. We next interrogated
an expanded version of the connectivity map database
(version 2) that includes an increased number of replicates
(instances) for each compound. This analysis confirmed
negative scores for all compounds. The correlation of 17AAG was validated in more than 60 instances, and the sigCancer

nificance of the association was strengthened with a
P value of <.00001. Although the P value for resveratrol
remained significant, the P value for rapamycin was
increased to .14 (Table 2). In addition, this analysis identified specificity values of 0.13 and 0.27 for 17-AAG and
resveratrol, respectively. These specificity values represent
an estimate of the uniqueness of the connectivity between
the query signature of interest and the set of instances
based on the behavior of the latter from analyses of results
produced from diverse signatures (Table 2).

Experimental Verification of Drug Effects
We began by assessing the cytotoxicity of each candidate
agent in 2 different invasive human HCC cell lines,
HepG2 and PLC/PRF-5. Cell viability was assessed using
an assay for metabolically active cells after incubating cells
for 24 hours with variable concentrations of the candidate
agents ranging from 0 to 100 lM. Resveratrol did not significantly alter cell viability, although a trend toward
increased cell numbers was noted at higher concentrations
in PLC/PRF-5 cells. Although 17-AAG did not alter cell
viability in HepG2 cells, a concentration-dependent toxicity was noted with PLC/PRF-5 cells (Fig. 2). To experimentally validate the ability of these selected compounds
to modulate the invasive phenotype, we examined their
effect on the ability of HepG2 and PLC/PRF-5 cells to
invade extracellular matrix. Both compounds when used
at a noncytotoxic concentration (10 lM) reduced invasion in both cell lines (Fig. 3), with the greatest decrease
noted in PLC/PRF-5 cells. Further study showed a timedependent effect of 17-AAG in reducing cell migration in
PLC/PRF-5 cells (Fig. 4). These studies experimentally
verified the effects of the candidate compounds on the
invasive phenotype in HCC cells in vitro.

17-AAG Modulates Gene Expression in HCC
We focused our studies on 17-AAG, given the lack of
published literature regarding the role of this compound
in HCC. First, we assessed the ability of 17-AAG to modulate gene expression in HCC cells. By using a real-time
PCR assay, we assessed the expression of several diverse
genes involved in cancer. Changes were observed in
several genes involved in invasion, adhesion, and angiogenesis. For example, the expression of genes such as

FIGURE 1. Identification of candidate phenotype-targeting agents based on bioinformatics analysis is shown. Computational
bioinformatics analysis was performed using the connectivity map database by querying a gene signature derived from the phenotype of interest, namely invasive hepatocellular carcinoma. 17-AAG indicates 17-allylamino-geldanamycin; 17-DMAG, 17-dimethylamino-geldanamycin. (A) The connectivity score is a measure of the degree of correlation with the query gene signature. The
maximum connectivity score is plotted against the permutation probability value for perturbagens with a highly significant
inverse correlation. The numbers in parentheses represent the total number of treatment-control pairs (instances) for that specific perturbagen in the database. (B) Bar graphs represent the connectivity score data for each selected compound. The black
horizontal lines represent each instance in the result. The color of the bar depicts the connectivity score, with dark gray representing positive and light gray negative scores. Most of the individual results for these agents were negative. Although a few
instances did not reveal any effect, no positive correlations were observed.

thrombospondin and pinin was increased.20-22 Also the
expression of MTSS1, frequently lost in advanced stage
cancers, and of TIMP-3, a negative regulator of the invasion capacity of hepatoma cells, was increased23 (Fig. 5).
Next, we evaluated the effect of 17-AAG on maspin,
an attractive potential mediator of the effects of 17-AAG
on invasion, because HSP-90 frequently interacts with
maspin.24 Loss of maspin can contribute to tumor invasion
and metastasis in cancer cells.25 In addition, maspin can
block neovascularization and reduce the density of tumorassociated microvessels in vivo.26 Thus, we speculated that
the altered maspin activation could contribute to the ability
of 17-AAG to reverse tumor cell invasion. Indeed, the level
of maspin is reduced by 20% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 8%-32%) in PLC/PRF-5 cells compared with normal hepatocytes. Similar results have been noted in other
cancers.27,28 Moreover, 17-AAG induced expression of
maspin in PLC/PRF-5 cells by 38% (95% CI, 11%-65%).
These data support the potential involvement of maspin as
a mediator of the anti-invasive effects of 17-AAG.
We then assessed the effect of 17-AAG on
ADAMTS-1 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with
Cancer

August 15, 2009

ThromboSpondin-like motifs), a target gene included in
the query gene signature, which has been shown to be
reduced in invasive HCC. ADAMTS-1 can cleave and
remodel components of the extracellular matrix, and it has
antiangiogenic properties.29-31 Compared with normal hepatocytes, the expression of ADAMTS-1 was markedly
decreased in PLC/PRF-5 cells. Furthermore, incubation
with 10 lM 17-AAG resulted in a 1.88 (95% CI, 1.312.45)-fold increase in ADAMTS1 mRNA after 24 hours,
confirming that 17-AAG can revert gene expression associated with vascular invasion. These studies in combination
indicate that 17-AAG can exert anti-invasive effects
through modulation of gene expression in HCC cells.

DISCUSSION
The need for new therapeutics in liver cancer is highlighted by the general lack of efficacy for most currently
available agents for this tumor. Many recent studies have
detailed molecular pathways in HCC, and several molecular targeting agents are undergoing evaluation. In this
study, we have proposed the use of a novel approach to

FIGURE 3. The effect of resveratrol and 17-allylamino-geldanamycin (17-AAG) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell invasion is
shown. The ability of the candidate agents resveratrol and 17-AAG to target tumor cell invasion was assessed in both HepG2 and
PLC/PRF-5 cells. Invasion was assessed by quantitating the number of cells that were able to traverse across an extracellular matrix membrane. The test compounds were added at a concentration of 10 lM, and cell invasion was assessed after 24 hours. Positive controls used were picropodophyllin (PPP), which reduces migration in HCC cells, and sorafenib, which is used in clinical
practice.41 The negative control represents an internal control with no chemoattractant. Results represent mean and confidence
interval of 3 experiments.

reduction in cell migration was noted with both compounds. Results represent mean and confidence interval of 3 experiments.

Refinements of the bioinformatics approach, the increasing availability of genome-scale information on candidate

of their effects on diverse epithelia will facilitate this
approach.32

critical cellular functions have limited the use of these therapeutic strategies for many human solid tumors to date.
The approach presented herein represents a further evolution of these strategies, with the emphasis shifting toward
targeting specific phenotypes. This approach is based on
targeting gene expression profiling associated with the phenotype of interest. The rapidly increasing availability of
genomic expression data emphasizes the value of this strategy. Extension of this approach using phenotype-defining
proteomic, metabolomic, or glycomic profiles to inform
drug discovery may also be appropriate once the relevant
data and analytic tools are developed.
HCC is a highly aggressive tumor, partly because of
the high capability of tumor cells to invade macroscopic
3746

and microscopic vascular structures. Indeed, vascular
invasion is an established adverse prognostic factor that
accounts for a recurrence rate >50% after resection or
locoregional treatments.6,33 The availability of new therapeutic agents that can limit invasion will provide benefits
for patients with established hepatocellular cancer, and
moreover, represents an ideal adjuvant strategy. This
approach is very attractive after surgical resection, the outcomes of which are hindered by tumor recurrence.
Although HSP-90 is an attractive target for solid
tumors, the utility of HSP-90 inhibitors as a therapeutic
strategy for HCC has not been fully explored. HSP-90
inhibitors such as NVP-AUY922 and SNX2112 have
shown efficacy in preclinical models and have now entered
clinical trials for several tumors.34 Concerns about the
hepatotoxicity of geldanamycin may be resolved with
these newer HSP-90 inhibitors and enable studies for liver
cancer. HSP-90 is a molecular chaperone with the

capability to modulate several key mediators of tumor
progression. Thus, multifaceted, combinatorial blockade
of several signaling pathways likely contributes to the
therapeutic efficacy of HSP-90 inhibitors.35-37 Our data
showing alterations in multiple genes associated with
cancer by 17-AAG indicates that similar effects occur in
HCC. The tolerability and antitumor effect of 17-AAG
have recently been shown in an animal model using HCC
xenografts.38 These data validate our in silico approach to
identifying new chemical agents with therapeutic
potential.
Although several genes can be altered by 17-AAG,
we were interested in genes with potential effects on maintaining an invasive phenotype. Maspin is an attractive mediator of the effect of 17-AAG. The expression of maspin
is reduced in HCC compared with normal hepatocytes.39
Moreover, maspin is also a target of miR-21, which is
overexpressed in HCC, as well as in many other cancers.15,40 In addition, maspin can act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer40 and oral carcinomas,27 suggesting
that maspin can function as an oncosuppressor. Similarly,
the involvement of other genes such as ADAMTS-1 indicates that multiple genetic effects contribute to the effects
observed with 17-AAG. Although the focus of our work is
on the use of gene signatures to reflect phenotype, individual genes with biological plausibility that warrant additional evaluation may also be identified.
Computational bioinformatics analysis has identified a candidate agent with multiple beneficial effects
that warrants further evaluation in liver cancers. The
strength of this approach is that it can be used to identify
potential drugs without a detailed knowledge of specific
targets. Moreover, the use of whole genome–based analysis may provide an approach to improving drug design,
by modifying candidate agents based on their selectivity
toward the target genomic profile, rather than on a
defined chemical target. Targeting specific cancer-associated phenotypes is a rational approach that we hope
will be adaptable to individualized, personalized treatment in the future, with the choice of appropriate agents
based on gene expression profiling for an individual
cancer.
