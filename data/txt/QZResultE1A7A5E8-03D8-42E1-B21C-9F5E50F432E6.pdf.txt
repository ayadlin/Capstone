ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis is attracting increasing attention
because it heralds an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing
surgery because of liver metastases. The aim of this study was to develop in vitro
and in vivo models to analyze the pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced
steatohepatitis.
Therefore, primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells were
incubated with 5-FU at non-toxic concentrations up to 24 h. Furthermore, hepatic
tissue of C57BL/6N mice was analyzed 24 h after application of a single 5-FU dose
(200 mg/kg body weight). In vitro, incubation with 5-FU induced a significant
increase of hepatocellular triglyceride levels. This was paralleled by an impairment
of mitochondrial function and a dose- and time-dependently increased expression
of fatty acid acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), which catalyzes the initial step for
peroxisomal β-oxidation. The latter is known to generate reactive oxygen species,
and consequently, expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1)
was significantly upregulated in 5-FU-treated cells, indicative for oxidative stress.
Furthermore, 5-FU significantly induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation
and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-8 and ICAM-1. Also in vivo, 5-FU
significantly induced hepatic ACOX1 and HMOX1 expression as well as JNK-activation,
pro-inflammatory gene expression and immune cell infiltration. In summary,
we identified molecular mechanisms by which 5-FU induces hepatocellular lipid
accumulation and inflammation. Our newly developed models can be used to gain
further insight into the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced steatohepatitis and to develop
therapeutic strategies to inhibit its development and progression.

one of its active metabolites, namely 5-fluorodeoxyuridine
monophosphate (5-FdUMP), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine
triphosphate (5-FdUTP) or 5-fluorouridine triphosphate
(5-FUTP) [1]. 5-FdUMP is a suicide inhibitor of thymidylate
synthase (TYMS), the only cellular de novo- source of
deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) [1]. Depletion
of dTMP leads to deoxynucleotide pool imbalances,

INTRODUCTION
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a uracil analogue and
widely used antimetabolite agent for the treatment of
various cancer types, including colorectal, breast, and
head and neck cancer [1, 2]. 5-FU does not exhibit
cytotoxic properties prior to intracellular conversion to

resulting in disruption of DNA synthesis and repair
[3, 4]. 5-FUTP is misincorporated into RNA, whereby
RNA processing and function are impaired [1, 4, 5].
Furthermore, 5-FdUTP incorporation into DNA inhibits
DNA synthesis and induces single- and double strand
breaks, leading to DNA fragmentation [6-8]. Despite its
benefits as a chemotherapeutic agent in neoadjuvant and
adjuvant treatment, especially for patients suffering from
(metastatic) colorectal cancer, several studies indicate that
5-FU can also induce liver injury [9-17].
Drug-induced liver injury shares several features
with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the
majority of patients, NAFLD is associated with risk factors
reflecting the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, insulin
resistance or dyslipidemia. With the continued rise of
obesity in the Western countries, the prevalence of NAFLD
has followed a similar trend and is today recognized as the
most common liver disease worldwide [18, 19]. NAFLD is
characterized by hepatic steatosis, which is also the most
documented liver pathology observed in association with
5-FU administration [14, 16, 17, 20]. In general, hepatic
steatosis is characterized by intravesicular accumulation of
fat in the form of triglycerides within hepatocytes [18, 19].
This is due to an imbalance between lipid uptake on the
one hand and their combustion or secretion on the other
hand [18]. In NAFLD, “simple” steatosis can progress to
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more serious liver
condition characterized by death of hepatocytes and liver
inflammation with and without hepatic fibrosis [18, 19].
Generally, the presence of steatosis renders the liver
more susceptible to hepatic injury [21]. Oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction and cytokine induction have
been identified as further factors that sensitize the liver to
an inflammatory reaction [18, 19].
Several studies showed that 5-FU induces oxidative
stress in cancer cells [22-24]. Therefore, 5-FU might also
be able to promote the development of steatohepatitis in the
presence of steatosis. Indeed, the so-called chemotherapyassociated steatohepatitis (CASH) is frequently observed
in patients treated with combination therapies of 5-FU
and irinotecan [9-13]. Although this damage is mostly
ascribed to irinotecan, an (additional) pathological role of
5-FU cannot be excluded. To date, the capability of 5-FU
to induce CASH has not been investigated in detail. Thus,
the aim of this study was to develop in vitro and in vivo
models for 5-FU-induced steatohepatitis and to identify
the underlying mechanisms for the induction of steatosis
and its progression to inflammation.

analysis (Figure 1A) and assessment of LDH levels in the
supernatant (Figure 1B) showed that concentrations up to
250 µM 5-FU were non-toxic for HepG2 cells. In response
to this 5-FU dose TYMS expression was significantly
increased (Supplementary Figure 1A) while expression
levels of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the
5-FU metabolizing enzyme, did not significantly change
(Supplementary Figure 1B). It has been described that
expression of genes encoding enzymes relevant to
5-flurouracil metabolism correlates with histologically
diagnosed chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury [25].
The missing increase of DPD in our experimental setting
may be explained by the application of non-toxic 5-FU
doses. However, in this dose range, incubation with 5-FU
significantly increased intracellular free fatty acid (FFA)
and triglyceride (TG) levels (Figure 1C). Compared to
control cells, FFA and TG content approximately doubled
in the presence of 200 µM 5-FU. This finding was
supported by oil red O staining, showing microvesicular
steatosis in 5-FU-treated cells (Figure 1D).
In line with these results, expression levels of
diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), which catalyzes
the terminal step in the formation of triglycerides, were
time- and dose-dependently increased in response to
5-FU (Figure 1E, 1F). Interestingly, 5-FU also caused a
significant induction of peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and PPAR-γ, both critical
regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism (Figure 1G).
However, expression levels of stearoyl-Coenzyme A
desaturase 1 (SCD-1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) were
not increased but even lower in 5-FU-treated compared
to untreated cells (Figure 1H). Also expression of fatty
acid elongases 6 (ELOVL6), which has been described
as critical promoter of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [26],
was reduced by 5-FU (Figure 1H). Together, these findings
indicate that the 5-FU-induced FFA and TG accumulation
in HepG2 cells is not mediated via de novo lipogenesis.

Effect of 5-FU on β-oxidation and oxidative
stress in hepatoma cells in vitro
In search for the underlying mechanisms of 5-FU
induced lipid accumulation, we analyzed expression
levels of genes that are involved in combustion of fatty
acids. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) is the key
enzyme for the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria
for β-oxidation [27, 28]. 5-FU caused a dose-dependent
induction of CPT-1 expression in HepG2 cells
(Figure 2B), whereby the maximum was reached 8 h after
stimulation (Figure 2A). ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) has
been described as a regulator of the carnitine system [29],
however, also this lipogenic enzyme was downregulated
in response to 5-FU treatment (Supplementary Figure
2A, 2B). Interestingly, the increased CPT-1-expression
was paralleled by reduced mitochondrial function as
analyzed by XTT-assays (Figure 2C, 2D). Impairment

24 h stimulation (Figure 2F). Peroxisomal β-oxidation is
known to lead to the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [27, 30-32], and the antioxidant enzyme heme
oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) has been shown to be increased in
response to oxidative stress [33]. Stimulation with 5-FU
caused a time- and dose-dependent induction of HMOX1
expression levels (Figure 2G, 2H) that paralleled the
pattern of 5-FU effects on ACOX1 mRNA levels. Together
these data suggest that in response to 5-FU-induced lipid
accumulation, mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation
are up-regulated and thus induce oxidative stress, a known
inducer of an inflammatory response.

cells (Supplementary Figure 3D). However, also in PHH,
5-FU caused a significant increase of the intracellular
FFA and triglyceride level (Figure 4C, 4D). PPAR-α and
PPAR-γ expression levels were not significantly altered
by 5-FU treatment in PHH (Figure 4E) and also SCD-1,
FASN, ACLY and ELOVL6 expression were similar or
lower in 5-FU stimulated PHH compared to control cells
(Figure 4F and Supplementary Figure 2C). These findings
indicated that also in PHH 5-FU-induced steatosis is not
mediated via de novo lipogenesis. However, incubation
with 5-FU significantly induced ACOX1 and HMOX1
expression (Figure 4G, 4H), as well as expression of proinflammatory genes (Figure 4I) in PHH. In summary,
the 5-FU effects on PHH reveal a high congruence with
the data obtained with HepG2 cells and indicate that this
human cell line is a suitable in vitro model to study 5-FUmediated effects related to hepatocellular steatosis and
inflammation.

Effect of 5-FU on hepatocellular inflammatory
response in vitro
To investigate the potential of 5-FU to induce
an inflammatory response the expression levels of
interleukin-8 (IL-8), a cytokine involved in the initiation
of an inflammatory reaction [34], and intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface molecule
that facilitates the adhesion of leukocytes [34], were
analyzed. Both IL-8 (Figure 3A, 3B) and ICAM-1 (Figure
3C, 3D) expression levels were markedly increased in
response to 5-FU. Expression levels showed a timedependent increase as early as 2 h after 5-FU treatment
and reached a plateau at 16 h (Figure 3A, 3C). Expression
of IL-8 and ICAM-1 is dependent on c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) activity [35, 36], and increased JNK
activation has also been identified as critical pathological
factor in the progression from steatosis to inflammation
in NAFLD [37]. Western blot analysis revealed that also
5-FU treatment significantly induced levels of phosphoc-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (phospho-JNK1/2) and
phosphorylated c-Jun (Figure 3E). These data suggest that
activation of the JNK pathway is mediating 5-FU-induced
pro-inflammatory gene expression in hepatoma cells in
vitro.

Effect of 5-FU on hepatic steatosis and
inflammation in mice
Next, we wanted to verify our in vitro findings in
an in vivo model of 5-FU-induced steatohepatitis in mice.
For that, mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single
dose of 5-FU (200 mg/kg body weight) and liver tissue and
blood samples were collected 24 h after injection. Plasma
aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were not elevated
(Figure 5A) and also H/E staining of liver tissue did not
show significant histological pathologies (Figure 5B) in
5-FU-treated mice under this experimental conditions. As
observed in PHH, DPD and TYMS expression were not
altered in the livers of 5-FU-treated mice (Supplementary
Figure 4A). Also FFA levels did not significantly differ, but
triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in the livers
of 5-FU-treated mice (Figure 5C). In contrast,PPAR-α and
PPAR-γ expression levels were not significantly altered
by 5-FU treatment (Supplementary Figure 4B), and SCD1, FASN, ACLY and ELOVL6 expression was similar
or lower in the livers of 5-FU-treated mice compared
to control animals (Supplementary Figure 4C). These
findings indicated that also in vivo, 5-FU-induced steatosis
is not mediated via de novo lipogenesis. However, both
hepatic CPT-1 (Figure 5D) and ACOX1 expression (Figure
5E) were significantly induced by 5-FU. Furthermore,
hepatic HMOX1 expression was significantly higher
in 5-FU-treated mice compared to controls (Figure 5F),
indicative for increased oxidative stress. Moreover, 5-FU
caused an induction of the JNK pathway in the liver of
treated mice (Figure 5G). Furthermore, hepatic CXCl1
and ICAM-1 expression were significantly induced
(Figure 5H, 5I) and also immunohistological CD3 staining
indicated an inflammatory response in the liver of 5-FUtreated mice (Figure 5J). Pro-ininflammatory cytokines
and hepatic inflammation, respectively, have been
suggested as regulators of hepatic plasminogen activator

Effect of 5-FU on primary human hepatocytes in
vitro
HepG2 cells are a widely used cellular in vitro
model to analyze drug metabolism and toxicity. Still, we
wanted to verify observed 5-FU effects in primary human
hepatocytes (PHH). A 5-FU dose of 500 µM did not affect
the viability of PHH (Figure 4A, 4B), and we used this
concentration for subsequent in vitro analyses in PHH.
5-FU stimulation did not affect DPD expression levels in
PHH (Supplementary Figure 3A), which were similar as
in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B). Moreover,
also TYMS expression was not altered in primary PHH in
response to 5-FU treatment (Supplementary Figure 3C).
This difference to HepG2 cells may be explained by the
fact that expression levels of this 5-FU target enzyme were
almost absent in PHH as compared to HepG2 hepatoma

inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. Accordingly, we observed
a significantly increased expression of this serine protease
inhibitor in the livers of 5-FU-treated mice (Figure 5K).

Results of studies performed in animal models of alcoholic
and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease suggest that PAI-1
is a key modulator of hepatic lipid transport and also

Actually, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-sma) expression
(Figure 5K) was significantly increased in the livers of
5-FU-treated mice indicating the activation of hepatic

application of 5-FU may also induce hepatic fibrosis in
mice similarly as observed in patients receiving long-term
chemotherapy [40].
In summary, the in vivo findings were consistent
with the observations made in vitro. Expression of
enzymes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal
β-oxidation was significantly induced and paralleled by
an upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme HMOX1,
indicative for oxidative stress in response to 5-FU
treatment. Moreover, 5-FU induced JNK-activation,
hepatocellular steatosis and an inflammatory reaction in
both models.

develop hepatic steatosis [14-17]. One factor contributing
to hepatocellular lipid accumulation is endogenous de
novo lipogenesis [49, 50]. However, key enzymes of
hepatic lipogenesis were not significantly increased or
even downregulated, respectively, in response to 5-FU
treatment. Another possible trigger for lipid accumulation
is impaired fatty acid degradation. Generally, fatty
acid molecules are broken down via beta-oxidation in
the mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA. However,
steatohepatitis-inducing drugs are often inhibitors of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain [51] and also 5-FU has
been shown to be related to a reduction of mitochondrial
membrane potential and mitochondrial membrane
collapse [52]. Fitting to this, we observed a dose- and
time- dependent impairment of mitochondrial function
in response to 5-FU treatment. An impairment of the
respiratory chain leads to an accumulation of electrons,
which directly react with oxygen to produce harmful ROS
[51]. Furthermore, lack of cofactors for β-oxidation such
FAD and NAD+ may additionally decrease metabolism
of FFAs, which accumulate and thus induce CPT-1
mRNA expression [53]. Fitting to this, induction of CPT1 expression was also observed in the livers of mice
after acute inhibition of mitochondrial β-oxidation [54].
Thus, it appears that also increased CPT-1 expression
in 5-FU-treated cells and livers was caused by impaired
mitochondrial β-oxidation.
A consequence of impaired mitochondrial
β-oxidation is a shift to extra-mitochondrial pathways. In
line with this, we observed a significant upregulation of
ACOX1, the initial enzyme for peroxisomal β-oxidation.
Also in rodent models of (non-alcoholic) steatosis
peroxisomal β-oxidation was shown to be increased [55].
This form of FFA combustion causes increased hydrogen
peroxide generation, thus contributing to harmful ROS
production in addition to an impaired respiratory chain.
Also in our in vitro and in vivo models, 5-FU caused a
marked upregulation of HMOX1 expression indicative for
oxidative stress. This is in accordance with other studies
that showed that 5-FU induces oxidative stress in cancer
cells [22, 56]. Our in vitro data indicate that the 5-FUinduced shift to peroxisomal β-oxidation and consecutive
induction of oxidative stress and inflammation occur
already after several hours. Accordingly, we also found
increasing ACOX1 expression, elevated HMOX1 and proinflammatory gene expression as well as CD3-infiltration
(Supplementary Figure 5A-5F) in vivo in mouse livers
already 12 h after 5-FU application.
Taken together, we propose the hypothesis that the
observed triglyceride accumulation induced by 5-FU is most
likely the result of mitochondrial β-oxidation impairment,
possibly by affecting the respiratory chain. Although fatty
acids are progressively oxidized in peroxisomes, they
are insufficiently metabolized and accumulate. Together,
impaired mitochondrial and enhanced peroxisomal fatty
acid metabolism lead to oxidative stress.

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to investigate molecular
mechanisms by which 5-FU affects hepatic steatosis and
inflammation.
Once, we established an in vitro model applying
HepG2 cells. This cell line has been most extensively
employed in many studies analyzing drug metabolism
and toxicity, since the cells retain a large part of cellular
functions similar to those of normal hepatocytes [41, 42].
Also because of the high degree of morphological and
functional differentiation, HepG2 cells are a suitable
model to study intracellular trafficking and drug targeting
in vitro [43]. In the present study, we found that 5-FUmediated effects in HepG2 cells and in primary human
hepatocytes were very similar. Therefore, we propose that
also for future studies analyzing 5-FU-mediated effects
on hepatocytes, such as screening of drugs that interfere
with the observed pathological mechanisms, respectively,
HepG2 can be a suitable model. 5-FU was applied in a
dose range not causing cellular injury to focus on direct,
cell specific effects. The applied 5-FU doses were in line
with previous studies of Novak et al. [44] and Gajski et al.
[45], who also found that doses up to 250 µM are nontoxic for HepG2 cells. Also for analyzing the effect of
5-FU in primary human hepatocytes, a dose was chosen in
accordance with previous studies showing that it does not
affect hepatocellular viability [46]
For in vivo analyses, we administered a single dose
of 200 mg/kg 5-FU to mice. This dose was below LD50
determined earlier in mice (250-500 mg/kg, depending
on the time of day) [47] and in line with previous studies
analyzing the anti-tumorigenic effect of 5-FU in murine
cancer models [48]. Also here, we chose experimental
conditions not causing significant hepatocellular injury
to specifically address direct 5-FU effects on liver cells.
And we applied only a single 5-FU dose to focus on early
5-FU-mediated effects.
An important observation in our study was that
5-FU treatment induced a significant triglyceride
accumulation in hepatocytes and HepG2 cells, an
incidence known from clinical trials, where up to half
of patients receiving 5-FU monotherapy were found to

ROS are known inducers of pro-inflammatory genes
[30, 31], and indeed we observed increased IL-8 and ICAM1 expression as well as induced hepatic infiltration with
immune cells in response to 5-FU treatment. Moreover,
5-FU treatment led to a significant activation of JNK. This
stress-activated protein kinase is an important modulator
in response to liver injury [57], and we and others have
shown that it plays a critical role in the development and
progression of hepatic inflammation in alcoholic as well
as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [37, 58].
Obesity is the major risk factor for NAFLD and it is also
an important risk factor for different types of cancer [59].
Therefore, it is likely that a significant number of cancer
patients receiving chemotherapy have also NAFLD. Future
experimental and epidemiological studies are warranted to
study whether already present hepatic steatosis is a trigger
for more hepatic inflammation and injury. Furthermore,
hepatic JNK-activation and inflammation may play a crucial
role in the progression and development of hepatocellular
cancer (HCC) [60, 61] as well as chemotherapy resistance
of HCC cells [62, 63]. Moreover, hepatic inflammation and
expression of IL-8 have been shown to promote hepatic
metastasis of several types of cancers [64, 65]. Therefore,
it is intriguing to speculate whether our findings may also
have impact on progression and chemotherapy (resistance)
of primary and secondary liver cancer, which needs to be
addressed in future studies.
In summary, our study indicates a crucial role of
5-FU in the development of chemotherapy-associated
steatohepatitis. As pointed out in the introduction, a two hit
model for the development and progression of non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease has been proposed [18, 66]. Critical steps
are hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis.
In this study, we identify molecular mechanisms by which
5-FU can induce both hepatocellular lipid accumulation
and inflammatory gene expression. Herewith, 5-FU
alone as well as together with other factors, such as
irinotecan, may be responsible for the critical hit tipping
the balance towards hepatic steatosis or from steatosis to
steatohepatitis, respectively. Our newly developed in vitro
and in vivo models can be used to get further insight into
the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced steatohepatitis and to
develop therapeutic strategies to inhibit the pathological
effects of this chemotherapeutic drug on hepatocytes.

For stimulation experiments with 5-FU, cells were
seeded in standard 6-well-plates at a density of 5x105
cells/well and were allowed to adhere for 24 h before
treatment. Cytotoxic effects were monitored by analysis
of LDH release into the supernatant (cytotoxicity detection
kit; Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN).

Murine models of 5-FU induced steatohepatitis
Female C57BL/6N mice (n=5/group), aged 7-9
weeks, were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose
5-FU (200 mg/kg) or isotonic saline solution (control
group). Liver tissue and blood samples were collected 12
h or 24 h after injection and immediately frozen and stored
at -80°C until subsequent analyses.

Analysis of cellular lipid content
Cellular lipid droplets were visualized by Oil Red
O staining as described [71]. Furthermore, total free fatty
acids (FFA) and cellular triglycerides were extracted
and quantified with the free fatty acids kit (half micro
test) (Roche diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and the
triglyceride determination kit (GPO) (Sigma, Deisenhofen,
Germany) [71].

Mitochondrial activity assay
For quantification of hepatocellular mitochondrial
activity, the colorimetric XTT assay (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantitative real-time-PCR analysis
RNA isolation from cells and tissues and subsequent
reverse transcription were performed as described [72].
Quantitative real-time-PCR was performed applying
LightCycler technology (Roche) [72]. The following
sets of primers were used: human ACLY (forward:
5’-CGGACTTCGGCAGAGGTAGA-3’, reverse 5’-GGG
GAG GGA ACT CGA TGT CA-3’), human DPD (forward:
5’-AGG ACG CAA GG AGG GTT TG-3’, reverse: 5’GTC CGC CGA GTC CTT ACT GA-3’), human ELOVL6
