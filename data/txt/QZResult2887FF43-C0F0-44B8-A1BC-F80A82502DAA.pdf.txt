BACKGROUND. For patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS), no standard
treatment is established after previous chemotherapy with anthracyclines and
ifosfamide. Bendamustine hydrochloride is a bifunctional alkylating agent that is
not cross-resistant to other DNA-interacting substances including anthracyclines
and oxazaphosphorines. It has shown single-agent activity in refractory lymphoma, myeloma, and some solid tumors. A phase 2 study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of bendamustine in previously treated patients.

METHODS. Thirty-six of 44 screened patients were included and received a total
of 101 cycles (median, 2 cycles; range, 1–8 cycles), 21 as second-line treatment
and 15 as third-line treatment. The median age was 55 years (range, 18–79 years).
Bendamustine was given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose
of 100 mg/m2 on 2 consecutive days and repeated every 28 days. Eighty-eight
percent of cycles could be given without dose or schedule modification.

RESULTS. The toxicity profile was mild, consisting of National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 neutropenia in 11% and grade 3 anemia
in 9% of patients. Nonhematologic toxicities were noticed with CTC grade 3 fever
in 3% of patients. No other grade 3 toxicity and no treatment-related toxic deaths
were observed. The best overall response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria was 1 partial remission (3%) and disease
stabilizations in 31% of patients. Six of 15 patients (40%) with leiomyosarcoma
histology achieved stable disease. The estimated 3-month and 6-month progression-free survival rates were 35.3% and 23.5%, respectively, for all histologic subtypes included.

CONCLUSIONS. In patients with refractory STS, bendamustine is well tolerated
and appears moderately effective, particularly in patients with leiomyosarcoma
histology. Cancer 2007;110:861–6.  2007 American Cancer Society.

S

oft tissue sarcomas (STS) account for approximately 1% of all
malignancies in adults. The histologic classification of STS is
complex. More than 50 histologic subtypes can be discerned.1 From
a clinical point of view, it is of utmost importance to detect tumors
occurring in pediatric patients, who are particularly amenable to
aggressive multimodality treatment in embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas or Ewing sarcoma. For patients with a sarcoma from the
remaining heterogeneous group of STS of adult types, a cure can
usually only be attained by radical resection.2 Approximately 25% of

patients with newly diagnosed STS present with metastatic disease. Depending on the stage at presentation, an additional 25% to 50% of patients with
locally advanced sarcomas will develop a recurrence.
The median overall survival in patients with metastatic STS is approximately 12 months and the 5-year
survival rate is approximately 5%. Once the disease
has spread to distant sites, treatment is palliative in
most cases. Among the ‘‘adult type’’ sarcomas, to
date only a few subtypes of STS require a specific
treatment (eg, imatinib in gastrointestinal stroma
tumors).
Only a limited number of drugs have shown significant single-agent activity in adult STS patients:
ifosfamide and the anthracyclines doxorubicin and
epirubicin. The response rate for doxorubicin and ifosfamide has a positive dose-response curve, with single-agent response rates between 20% and 35% when
doxorubicin is used at doses 75 mg/m2 and ifosfamide is used at doses 10 gm/m2.3–5 Although survival
chances are generally limited in the entire cohort with
metastatic disease, long-term survival may follow an
optimal response to chemotherapy in a subgroup of
patients.6
A number of additional substances has been
tested for STS with only moderate success (eg, gemcitabine, dacarbacine, topotecan, and trofosfamide).7–11 No standard treatment option has been
identified to date for patients with STS who fail previous treatment with anthracyclines and ifosfamide.
Bendamustine HCL is a bifunctional alkylating
agent that is not cross-resistant to other DNA-interacting substances including anthracyclines and the oxazaphosphorines cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. It
has shown activity in refractory lymphoma, myeloma,
breast cancer, and small cell lung cancer.12,13 The toxicity profile is favorable, with the main toxicity being
moderate suppression of bone marrow function. The
good subjective tolerability renders the drug an interesting candidate for palliative treatment situations in a
disease that is, in principle, responsive to alkylating
agents. The present study was launched to test the
activity of bendamustine HCL as a single agent in
patients with previously treated STS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objective, Endpoints, Study Design, and Statistics
The principal objective of the study was to evaluate
the efficacy of bendamustine HCL in patients with
metastatic STS who had progressed after or during
an anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The primary
endpoint was overall response rate (complete
response [CR] 1 partial response [PR]) as defined by

the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).14 Secondary endpoints were progressionfree rate (PFR) and the safety profile of bendamustine HCL. Adverse drug reactions were graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC; version. 2.0).
The study was designed as an open-label, multicenter, noncomparative phase 2 clinical trial. A 2stage study design according to Simon et al. with an
a error of 10% and a power of 90% (assumptions:
P0 5 10%, P1 5 30%, 2-sided) was chosen.15 The
sample size was 14 patients for the first stage. If at
least 1 response was observed in the first stage,
accrual was to be continued until 28 patients were
evaluable for response. The protocol was approved
by the ethical review board of Tuebingen University
Medical Center and by the local review boards of all
the participating centers.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Patients were required to have histologically proven,
unresectable STS of any grade that had progressed
during or recurred after chemotherapy with doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide. They needed to be at least
18 years of age, have measurable or evaluable disease
according to RECIST criteria, an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to
2, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and adequate function of bone marrow and kidneys (creatinine level <1.5 3 the upper limit of normal [ULN], a
white blood count >2500/lL, and a platelet count
>75,000/lL). Informed consent was required from all
patients.
Patients were excluded from the study for the
following reasons: previous or concomitant radiation
of the only indicator lesion, elevated liver functions
tests (aspartate or alanine aminotransferase >3
3 ULN or, in the case of documented liver metastases, >5 3 ULN), pathologic clotting tests (prothrombin time or the activated partial thromboplastin time
>1.5 3 ULN), uncontrolled infection, prior therapy
with bendamustine HCL, second malignancy within
the previous 5 years other than basal cell carcinoma
of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or the
bladder, congestive heart failure (New York Heart
Association [NYHA] scale III or IV), symptomatic
cerebrovascular insufficiency, central nervous system
metastases, interval to prior chemotherapy of <4
weeks, and a lack of contraception in women of
childbearing potential.
Treatment Schedule and Dose Modification
Bendamustine HCL was administered as a 30-minute
infusion at a dosage of 100 mg/m2 body surface area on

Bendamustine HCL in STS/Hartmann et al.

Days 1 and 2 every 28 days. Treatment interruption for 1
week was performed when granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia of NCI CTC grade 2 were evident on Day
29. In case of grade 3 or 4 hematotoxicity, treatment was
postponed for 7 days. In case of nonhematologic toxicity
of CTC grade 2 or 3, treatment was delayed until symptoms resolved to grade 0 or 1 and the bendamustine
HCL dose was reduced to 75% in the subsequent cycles.
In the case of first recurrence of toxicity grade 2 or 3, a
further reduction to 50% of the initial dose was allowed.
The third occurrence of toxicity resulted in termination
of the study. After the first occurrence of grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity, patients were either taken off study
immediately or the treatment was delayed as described
above and the dose reduced to 50% of the dose for the
subsequent cycles at the discretion of the treating physician. Dose re-escalations were not allowed. Blood cell
counts were performed weekly; X-ray, ultrasound, or
computed tomography scans for evaluation of treatment
response were performed at the end of every second
cycle.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between September 2002 and August 2006, 44
patients were screened and 36 patients were available for protocol inclusion. The median age of the
study population was 55 years (range, 18–79 years);
20 patients were women and 16 were men. The most
frequent histologic subtype was leiomyosarcoma
(n 5 15 patients), followed by pleomorphic sarcoma,
not otherwise specified (NOS) (n 5 11 patients). The
remaining cases were dedifferentiated liposarcoma
(n 5 4 patients), synovial sarcoma (n 5 2 patients),
pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (n 5 1 patient),
and fibrosarcoma (n 5 1 patient), as well as 1 patient
each with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
and a refractory primitive neuroectodermal tumor.
Tumor grading according to the Federation Nationale
des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC) was
grade 1 in 2 patients and grade 2/38 in 29 patients.
Grading was not applicable for 5 patients.
All patients were pretreated with 1 (n 5 21
patients) or 2 (n 5 15 patients) prior lines of chemotherapy. The first-line treatment consisted either of
the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide
(n 5 23 patients), doxorubicin alone (n 5 11
patients), or ifosfamide alone (n 5 2 patients). The
patients had received a median number of 6 cycles
of chemotherapy in the prior course of the disease
(range, 1–12 cycles). The majority of the patients
(n 5 20; 56%) developed disease progression during
the previous chemotherapy, 10 patients (28%) had a

Treatment and Toxicity
A total of 101 cycles were given (median, 2 cycles;
range, 1–8 cycles). Approximately 89% of the cycles
were given without dose modification or delay. The
encountered toxicities were mild to moderate. NCI
CTC grade 3 toxicity consisted only of anemia and
leukocytopenia in 3 and 4 patients, respectively. Nonhematologic toxicity consisted of grade 3 fever/infection and allergic reaction in a single patient each
(3%) (see Table 2 for details).
Efficacy
At the first response assessment after 2 months, 1
patient (3%) attained a PR. Eleven patients (31%)
demonstrated stable disease. Fourteen patients (39%)
were found to have progressive disease at planned
restaging and 9 patients (25%) patients showed clinically overt disease progression before application of
the second cycle and were taken off the study. One
patient did not receive assessment at that timepoint.
Twenty-four patients were taken off study due to
progressive disease, 1 patient due to toxicity (immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction), and another
due to a decreasing performance status. Two patients
withdrew their consent and 1 patient was lost to
follow-up. Six patients stopped treatment per protocol
after completion of 6 cycles. One patient who was
treated with bendamustine HCL developed acute
myeloid leukemia M5 according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification 1 month after the
initiation of treatment (cumulative dose of benda-

mustine HCL of 200 mg/m2). The patient had
received prior treatment with doxorubicin and trofosfamide and had undergone palliative radiation treatment of the sacral bone. The short interval between
the administration of study mediation and the onset
of leukemia would be exceptional for a treatmentinduced myeloid leukemia, even though a causal
relation to the study medication cannot be definitely
excluded.
In an intent-to treat setting the PFR rates at 3
and 6 months were 35.3% (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 19.3–51.3%) and 20.6% (95% CI, 7.1–34.1%),
respectively. Among the largest group of histologic
subtypes, the leiomyosarcomas, the PFR rates for
these patients were 42.9% and 35.7% at 3 and 6
months, respectively (Fig. 1). Overall survival data
with respect to leiomyosarcoma and nonleiomyosarcoma strata are shown in Figure 2.

DISCUSSION
Patients with metastatic STS have a dismal prognosis.
Once treatment with doxorubicin and ifosfamide
have failed, only a few established treatment options
can be offered to these patients. Numerous agents
have been investigated in exploratory phase 2 clinical
trials. Among these, dacarbazine is most likely the
most commonly used drug. However, the response
duration has been disappointing. Similar results have
been previously reported for gemcitabine.9,16 Promising data were recently available for the combination
of gemcitabine and docetaxel in leiomyosarcoma and
in other types of adult STS.17,18 This phase 2 study
was designed to evaluate the promise of a second-

Bendamustine HCL in STS/Hartmann et al.

In summary, bendamustine HCL demonstrated
moderate activity in patients with STS, particularly of
leiomyosarcoma histology. Given the favorable toxicity profile and the encouraging disease stabilization
rate in leiomyosarcomas, it appears justified to further explore the drug in combination with established agents.

line or third-line chemotherapy with bendamustine
HCL.
In keeping with the data from trials using bendamustine HCL for patients with myeloma, lymphoma,
and breast cancer, the drug was well tolerated. The
major toxicities observed were leukocytopenia and
thrombocytopenia. No serious infections were
observed, nor did bleeding complications occur. The
vast majority of the cycles could be given without
dose reductions or delays. However, the majority of
the patients received only 2 cycles before the treatment was withdrawn due to disease progression.
Thus, the cumulative toxic effects could easily be
missed in the study.
Only 1 patient achieved an objective remission
(3%) in the study population. In addition, a total of
11 patients (31%) experienced disease stabilization
at the first response assessment. These data are in
keeping with results of drugs commonly used in
second-line therapy in refractory sarcoma patients,
such as ifosfamide or dacarbazine. Of note, a substantial quantity of 15 patients with leiomyosarcomas had disease stabilization at the time of initial
evaluation, indicating that this entity is likely to
respond to bendamustine HCL. If patients with
nonleiomyosarcomas were to be excluded, the rate
of disease stabilization rates—a clinically meaningful result with regard to the limited options available to help these patients—were 42.9% and 35.7%
at 3 and 6 months, respectively.19 This appears promising in the context of recently reported results of
new drug classes such as mTOR inhibitors, which
failed to demonstrate superior activity in refractory
STS subtypes.
