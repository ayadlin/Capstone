ABSTRACT:
Overexpression of Shc adaptor proteins is associated with mitogenesis,
carcinogenesis and metastasis. Multiple copies in T-cell malignancy 1 (MCT-1)
oncoprotein promotes cell proliferation, survival and tumorigenic effects. Our current
data show that MCT-1 is a novel regulator of Shc-Ras-MEK-ERK signaling and MCT-1
is significantly co-activated with Shc gene in human carcinomas. The knockdown of
MCT-1 enhances apoptotic cell death accompanied with the activation of caspases
and cleavage of caspase substrates under environmental stress. The cancer cell
proliferation, chemo-resistance and tumorigenic capacity are proved to be effectively
suppressed by targeting MCT-1. Accordingly, an important linkage between MCT1 oncogenicity and Shc pathway in tumor development has now been established.
Promoting MCT-1 expression by gene hyperactivation may be recognized as a tumor
marker and MCT-1 may serve as a molecular target of cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

p52Shc and p46Shc activate Ras-ERK pathway [9, 12]. But,
p66Shc was originally recognized as an inhibitor of ERK1/2
activity and found to antagonize mitogenic and surviving
abilities of T-lymphoma Jurkat cell line [13]. The increase
in p66Shc promoted the stress-induced apoptosis and the
p66Shc knockout mice were confirmed to have a longevity
effect [11, 13, 14]. Moreover, p66Shc restrains Ras hyperactivation, Rb-dependent proliferation and metastatic
feature of lung carcinoma cells [15].
Paradoxically, p66Shc activates ERK1/2 and
enhances proliferation of prostate cancer cells [16]. As
well as, abundant expression of p66Shc was also recognized
in many breast cancer cell lines and primary breast
tumors with high metastatic potential [17], suggesting
its important impact on tumorigenicity. Moreover,
p66Shc protein level is induced by steroid hormone in the
proliferation of several carcinoma cells and in primary
prostate cancers [18]. The novel roles of Shc proteins,
especially p52Shc and p66Shc, have been identified in steroid
hormone-regulated cancers and metastasis [10]. p66Shc is
also functionally involved in regulating oxidative stressinduced apoptosis which mediates steroid action via the

The development of cancer can be attributed to
biological aberrations, including the ability to sustain
proliferative signaling, to avoid growth suppressors, to
resist cell death, to replicate indefinitely, to stimulate
angiogenesis and chromosomal instability [1]. Src
homolog and collagen homolog (Shc) (gene aliases, Shc
1 and ShcA), the adaptor proteins transmit the signaling
of cell surface receptors [2], such as EGF receptor
(EGFR) [3], erbB-2 receptor [4] and insulin receptor
[5]. Shc function was proved to be sufficient for tumor
progression in MMTV/MT transgenic mice by knock-in
alleles of the ShcA gene [6]. ShcA adaptor also plays a
critical role in TGF-β- and Neu/ErbB-2-induced breast
cancer cell motility and invasion [7]. The abundance of
Shc protein is concomitant with human endometriosis
which is associated with ERK1/2 hyperactivation and
susceptibility to breast cancer [8]. Shc proteins have three
isoforms with distinct molecular weights (46, 52 and 66
kDa), playing multiple important roles in mitogenesis,
carcinogenesis and metastasis [3, 9, 10]. For example,

redox signaling pathway [19]. Signaling activation of Shc
is thus implicated in tumorigenesis and the behaviors of
cancer cells, suggesting Shc’s potential as a prognosic
marker and a target for cancer treatment.
Multiple Copies in T-cell malignancy 1 (MCT-1)
also known as Malignant T Cell-amplified Sequence 1
(MCTS1) was originally identified in a lymphoma cell
line [20]. Ectopic MCT-1 expression elicits CDK4/
CDK6 kinase activity and Cyclin D1 accumulation,
thereby stimulating cell proliferation [21]. The oncogenic
MCT-1 enhances AKT activity and protects cells against
programmed death under environmental stress [22]. In
addition to be phosphorylated in vitro by CDC2 and
involved in cell cycle progression [20, 23], MCT-1 protein
physically interacts with the centrosomal apparatus and
regulates mitotic progression and spindle assembly
[24]. Overexpression of MCT-1 oncogene transforms
NIH3T3 (murine fibroblasts) and MCF-10A (human
breast epithelia) cells [20, 25]. Cells introducing MCT1 evade growth suppression and checkpoint control as
well as proficiently promote p53 destabilization via an
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway following DNA damage
[26]. The synergistic promotions on the cell migration
and tumorigenic process have been demonstrated in
MCT-1 overexpression alongside p53 deficiency [27,
28]. Intriguingly, induction of MCT-1 in the p53-deficient
cells advances ERK1/2 activity [26], genomic instability
[27], nuclear aberrations and mitotic catastrophes [24].
Furthermore, the posttranslational regulations associated
with Hu Antigen R (HuR) which connects to the enhanced
translation of tumor-promoting genes, such as Cyclin D1,
or the decreased translation of tumor-suppressing genes,
such as caspase 2, are altered by overexpressing MCT1 [29]. Relating to the HuR function and promoting of
the angiogenicity [30, 31], the angiogenesis inhibitor
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is suppressed by the induction
of MCT-1.
We demonstrate for the first time that both MCT1 and Shc genes are highly activated in human cancers.
Targeted suppression of MCT-1 promotes caspase
activation, apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity but inhibits
Shc expression, anchorage-independent growth and
xenograft tumorigenicity.

carcinomas, in which the MCT-1 mRNA revealed a
2-fold induction over the mean of normal lung tissue
were recognized as high expression of MCT-1 gene.
Accordingly, MCT-1 gene was observed to be significantly
induced in stage I (83.3%), stage II (76.7%), stage III
(85.3%) and stage IV (100%) of 124 lung cancer patients
(Table 1). Overall, 83.9% of the cancer samples showed
a significant elevation of MCT-1 mRNA level, indicating
the clinical relevance of MCT-1 gene stimulation in lung
carcinomas. Shc induction is implicated in tumorigenesis
[6, 10, 19]. As examined in Shc mRNA level, we found
that Shc gene was highly activated in different stages of
lung cancer (Table 2). Overall, 62.1% of the 124 lung
cancer patients had a significant induction of Shc gene.
The frequency of MCT-1 and Shc gene co-activation
was again studied, and the results showed that 58.1%
of the cancer patients exhibited high activation of both
MCT-1 and Shc genes but only 11.3% of cases expressed
low-level of both genes (Table 3). The data of positive
association of Shc and MCT-1 gene activation in human
lung cancers was statistically significant (p< 0.0001).
The Breast Cancer Tissue qPCR Array (Panel III and
IV) (OriGene Technologies, Inc.,) was further studied to
explore the linkage of Shc and MCT-1 genes that highly
induced in another type of human cancer. Among 92
breast cancer tumors, we found that 56.5% of the biopsies
had dual activation of Shc and MCT-1 genes, but only
14.1% of the samples had low-expression in both genes
(Supplementary Table 1). Highly concomitant activation
of Shc and MCT-1 genes was also observed in human
breast cancer (p<0.0001), revealing their clinical relevance
on mammary tumorigenicity as well.

MCT-1 regulates the signaling cascade of ShcRas-MEK-ERK
To investigate the role of MCT-1 in Shc signaling
pathway, the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were transfected
into MCF-10A, H1299 and A549 cells to knockdown
MCT-1 gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 1A-C).
Based on the level of MCT-1 protein production, the
vector control transfectant was named “High” (with a
maximal-amount of MCT-1), and the MCT-1 shRNA
transfectants were named “Medium” (with a middle-level
of MCT-1) and “Low” (with a low-level of MCT-1). As
evaluated by flow cytometry analysis in regular culture
condition, no significant change in the cell cycle profiling
was observed upon MCT-1 reduction (Supplementary Fig.
1D).
Shc participates in regulation of Ras signaling
activation [2]. H-Ras activity was first examined to
define whether the decrease in MCT-1 suppressed this
essential component controlling cell proliferation (Fig.
1A). MCF-10A cells were starved for 24 h, followed
by re-activation with serum for different time (5 and 15
min). The active H-Ras isolated by Raf-1 RBD-coupled

Table 2: Shc mRNA expression levels in human lung
cancers. The TissueScan lung cancer tissue cDNA arrays

(Panels II, III and V) were used to analyze the Shc gene (three
isoforms) expression by Q-RT-PCR analysis. The Shc mRNA
level identified in tumors was normalized to β-actin and
calibrated to the overall mean of Shc mRNA level of normal
lung tissue. Shc mRNA levels in tumors which elevated a 1.5fold increase over normal breast tissues were defined as the
high-activation of Shc gene. Shc transcripts were observed to be
induced in lung cancers. The statistical analysis used Fisher’s
exact test.

Table 1: MCT-1 mRNA expression levels in human
lung cancers. The TissueScan lung cancer tissue cDNA arrays

Panel II, III and V consisted of a total of 19 normal lung samples
and 124 lung cancer biopsies from different individuals were
analyzed the expression of MCT-1 mRNA by Q-RT-PCR. The
MCT-1 mRNA level in each tumor sample was normalized to
β-actin mRNA and calibrated to the overall mean of MCT-1
mRNA level of normal tissue (set as 1-fold). MCT-1 mRNA had
a >2-fold induction in tumor samples over normal lung tissue
were defined as the gene high-activation. The statistical analysis
used Fisher’s exact test.

The direct effect of MCT-1 knockdown on cell
propagation was evaluated by MTT assay. After
cultivation in regular media for 3 days, MCF-10A
proliferation rate showed a significant difference
comparable to the amounts of MCT-1 expression (Fig.
1G). MCT-1’s role in regulating A549 cell proliferation
was next studied in regular media (Fig. 1H). At day 9, the
control A549 cells with a high-level of MCT-1 proliferated
more rapidly (42-fold increase), than those of cells with a
medium-level (29-fold increase) or with a low-level (28fold increase) of MCT-1 protein. Thus, MCT-1 regulates
cell proliferation attended with control of the Shc pathway.

sepharose was normalized to total H-Ras levels before
comparing with the non-silenced control cells cultured
in a serum-free condition (time 0). After stimulation for
5 min, H-Ras activity showed a 5-fold increase over the
serum-depleted control cells with a high-level of MCT1 (quantified as 1-fold). However, H-Ras activity was
less induced when the MCT-1 knockdown cells were
stimulated by the serum for 5 min (2.6-fold) and 15 min
(1.4-fold) (lanes 6 and 9). Reduced H-Ras activity also
was recognized in H1299 cells while depleting of MCT-1
(Fig. 1B). Consistent with inhibition of H-Ras activity, the
phospho-activation of Raf, MEK and ERK1/2 were also
found to be decreased upon MCT-1 reduction. Cyclin D1,
a proliferation marker transcriptionally regulated by ERK
[32, 33], was again observed to be consistently reduced
by MCT-1 knockdown. Intriguingly, along with decrease
in MEK-ERK signaling activation, the expression of Shc
isoforms (p66Shc, p52 Shc, and p46 Shc) were dramatically
suppressed corresponding to the degree of MCT-1
knockdown in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results
were identified in A549 cellular context that Shc proteins,
Cyclin D1, p-ERK and p-Rb were all decreased by loss of
MCT-1 (Fig. 1D). Further analysis of Shc mRNA level
indicated that knockdown of MCT-1 inhibited Shc gene
transcription, most likely due to MCT-1’s impact on Shc
gene transcription that accounted for the decrease of Shc
protein (Fig. 1E and 1F).

Knockdown of MCT-1 enhances spontaneous cell
death and activates caspase 3
ERK activates MDM2 that promotes p53
degradation [34]. We here identified that knockdown of
MCT-1 in MCF-10A cells led to ERK dephosphorylation
and p53 accumulation as cultured in regular media for
5 days (Fig. 2A). Active caspases trigger programmed
cell death [35]. Integrin β 4 and vimentin are cleaved by
caspase 3 and 7 in apoptosis, which have been recognized
as potential molecular targets for cancer treatment [36-38].
The proteolysis of integrin β 4 (indicated by asterisks)
and the accumulation of p53 were positively correlated
with the decrease of MCT-1 in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2A).
Similarly, the levels of vimentin and p53 presentation
were decreased by suppressing MCT-1 in A549 cells
(Fig. 2B). Caspase 3 activity was again analyzed by
the cleavage of colorimetric peptide Ac-DEVD-pNA
and the release of chromophore p-nitroaniline (pNA)

cells entered apoptotic death, but only 20% of control cells
died from such stress.
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is cleaved
by active caspases in apoptosis [42]. Integrin β4 (205
kDa) is cleaved into 180- and 150-kDa products during
apoptosis by caspase 3 and 7 [38]. During 24 h and 36
h starvation, not only the integrin β4 but also the PARP
were increasingly cleaved due to MCT-1 reduction (Fig.
3B). Since the specific proteolytic products of integrin β4
(180 and 150 kDa) (indicated by asterisks) were steadily
accumulated in a fasting time-dependent and in a MCT1 dose-dependent manner, thereby we speculated that
the cleavage of integrin β4 relied more on the activity
of caspases 3 and 7 in the MCT-1 knockdown cells.
Consistent with this notion, the proteolytic activation of
caspases 3 and 7 but not caspase 6 were detected (panels
3-5), showing that the caspase cascade was enhanced upon
decrease of MCT-1.
To study whether the caspase activation mediated
apoptosis upon MCT-1 reduction (Fig. 3C), MCF-10A
cells were cultured in the serum-free media with different
concentrations of a general caspase inhibitor, z-VADFMK (Caspase Inhibitor VI) [43]. By 24 h starvation, cell
growth was decreased dramatically corresponding to the
decrease of MCT-1 expression. In treatment of z-VADFMK (25 and 50 µM), the MCT-1 knockdown cells were
protected from the apoptotic effect in a dose-dependent
manner. As exposed to z-VAD-FMK at concentration of
100 µM, cell survival rates were restored even better than
the un-stress and MCT-1-proficient state, indicating that
the activation of caspases mediate the apoptotic effect
collectively promoted by MCT-1 depletion and serum
starvation.

Table 3: The association of MCT-1 and Shc gene
activation in lung cancer patients (LCPs). The co-

activation of MCT-1 and Shc genes among the 124 human
lung cancers were studied. Overall, 58.1% of the LCPs highly
expressed both MCT-1 and Shc genes, but only 11.3% of the
biopsies exhibit low expression of both genes. The correlation
of MCT-1 and Shc gene induction is statically significant (p<
0.0001). The statistical analysis used Fisher’s exact test.

(Fig. 2C). The quantitative data revealed more than a
1.5-fold and a 2.5-fold increase in the relative activity
of caspase 3 as MCT-1 differentially reduced in MCF10A cells (Medium and Low). Inhibition of caspase 3
activity was also consistently identified in A549 cells lack
of MCT-1 (shMCT-1) (Fig. 2D). Caspase 3 activation
and p53 accumulation enhance apoptotic effects [39,
40]. To exam whether intrinsic apoptosis was induced
by targeted suppression of MCT-1, A549 cell viability
were determined by exclusion trypan blue effect as cells
cultured in normal media for 5 days. The apoptotic rate
was found to be much enhanced in knockdown of MCT1 (38%) even in basal, unstressed culture condition,
comparing to high survival ability of the comparable
control cells (7%) (Fig. 2E). In consistence, MCF-10A cell
viability was affected by the degree of MCT-1 reduction
in regular culture (Supplementary Fig. 1E, indicated by
arrowheads). We next evaluated cell expansion ability
at a very low cell density (1000 cells/100 mm dish) as
described previously [41]. After incubation in regular
media for 2 weeks (Fig. 2F), the clonogenic cell growth
were evaluated by crystal violet staining and the results
identified a significant decrease of clonogenic capability
upon knockdown of MCT-1 in different cell types.

Inhibiting cancer cell growth and chemoresistance by reduction of MCT-1
We next investigated whether inhibition of MCT-1
conferred chemo-sensitivity of A549 cancer cells. Taxol,
a mitotic inhibitor of cancer therapy [44], was treated
cells for 3 days and the MCT-1 knockdown cells (MCT1 shRNA) exhibited a higher susceptibility to Taxol that
the apoptotic effect was much increased compared to
the control cells (mock) (Fig. 4A). In the response to
topoisomerase II inhibitor [45], Doxorubicin (DOX), for
2 days (Fig. 4B), A549 cell viability was found to be much
reduced upon loss of MCT-1. Consistent with increased
cytotoxicity, the cleavage of Vimentin and PARP, and
the proteolytically-active caspase 7 and 3 were actually
promoted by DOX treatment, particularly in combination
with MCT-1 knockdown (Fig. 4C). Camptothecin (CPT),
an inhibitor of topoisomerase I [46], its analogues are
widely used in cancer chemotherapy [47, 48]. The MCT1 knockdown cells also showed to be more susceptible
to CPT treatment for 24 h at different concentrations

The enhanced cleavage of integrin β4, PARP and
pro-caspases after MCT-1 reduction
To again exam if the loss of MCT-1 promoted
apoptosis under the starvation condition, MCF-10A cells
were starved for the indicated time (Fig. 3A). Being in
the serum-free environment for 24 h, apoptotic rates were
greatly promoted in cells with a medium-level (85%) or
with a low-level (94%) of MCT-1 than that of control cells
(7%). Upon fasting for 72 h, most of the MCT-1-deficient

Figure 1: Knockdown of MCT-1 inhibits Shc-Ras-MEK-ERK signaling and cell proliferation. (A) MCF-10A cells starved

for 24 h were sub-cultured in regular media for different times. GTP-bound Ras protein was isolated from cell extracts by RBD domaincoupled sepharose. The level of active H-Ras was normalized with β-actin amount before comparing with the active H-Ras under the serum
starvation (set as 1-fold). H-Ras activity is decreased by suppressing MCT-1. (B) H-Ras activity and its downstream signaling molecules
were also inhibited in H1299 cells with MCT-1 knockdown. (C) Together with the reduction of Shc proteins, the accumulation of Cyclin D
and the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK were all steadily suppressed by depleting MCT-1 in MCF-10A cells. (D) Abolition of MCT-1
in A549 cell also decreases the expression of Shc, p-ERK, Cyclin D1 and p-Rb than the control cells. (E-F) As analyzed by Q-RT-PCR,

72 h in the absence of MCT-1. (H) A549 cells were cultured in regular media and cell proliferation rate was much reduced upon MCT-1
knockdown. The fold-change of each protein was quantified as compared to the vector control (set as 1-fold).

of p66Shc, Cyclin D1 and p-ERK in tumors were all
comparatively reduced as MCT-1 was deficient (Fig. 5F).
Downregulation of Shc mRNA levels in A549 tumors also
reasonably explained the degree of Shc protein reduction
(Fig. 5G), similar to that in the A549 cells (Fig. 1F).

of MCT-1 knockdown on tumorigenicity, the A549 cells
with differential level of MCT-1 protein were inoculated
subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice. The xenograft
mice were maintained for 2 months, during which time
tumor volumes were, measured every 3 or 4 days (Fig.
5B). The A549 cells present a high-level of MCT-1
yielded much larger tumors, but the tumor growth was
apparently suppressed as MCT-1 reduced to either a
medium or to a low level (Fig. 5C). The quantification
data indicated that the tumor incidences decreased to 70%
in A549 cells with a low-level of MCT-1 protein (Fig.
5D). The average tumor volume was also dramatically
decreased corresponding to the extent of MCT-1 reduction
from 508.11 mm3 in the control cells (high MCT-1) to
153.57 mm3 (medium MCT-1) and to 88.48 mm3 (low
MCT-1), which also referred in the tumor weights (Fig.

consistently decreased after MCT-1 depletion (Fig. 6A).
By culturing H1299 cells in 1% FBS medium for different
periods (Fig. 6B), the control group displayed a 5.7-fold
increase in cell number by 72 h, whereas the cells with
a medium-level and a low-level of MCT-1 grew much
slowly that exhibited a 4.3-fold and a 2.7-fold increase in
cell number, respectively.
To further investigate tumor development in the
deficiency of MCT-1, BALB/c nude mice were inoculated
subcutaneously (s.c.) with H1299 cancer cells (2×106)
expressed various amounts of MCT-1 protein (High,
Medium and Low) (Fig. 6C). A month after injection,
tumor burdens were observed to be greatly reduced in the
absent of MCT-1. At the time of sacrifice, no indication of
tumor development from the H1299 cells with only a lowlevel of MCT-1 protein. The representative tumor images
demonstrated a dramatic reduction of tumor loads upon
MCT-1 inhibition. The statistically significant differences
were detected in tumor incidences and tumor weights
accounting to the levels of MCT-1 expression (Fig. 6D).
Further examining the protein presented in the tumors,

MCT-1, Shc (p66/p52), Cyclin D1 and p-Rb showed
particular decreases in the context of MCT-1 depletion
(MCT-1 shRNA) compared to the control cells (mock)
(Fig. 6E). In agreements, MCT-1 and Shc mRNA levels
were decreased by 40% and by 60%, coordinating with
the status of MCT-1 reduced in tumors (Fig. 6F). Taken
together, the attenuation or prevention of tumor growth
because of targeting MCT-1 again closely connects to
the inhibitory effect on Shc-ERK-Cyclin D1 cascade.
Upregulation of Shc activity under MCT-1 oncogenic
stress may potentially result in promoting cancer cell
proliferation and tumor progression.

compared to the control cells with a high-level of MCT-1. (B) The proteolysis of integrin β4 and PARP proteins (denoted by asterisks) are
synergistically enhanced by MCT-1 reduction and serum depletion. The pro-caspase 3 and 7 but not 6 are cleaved to be active, particularly
in MCT-1 deficient condition. Each proteolytic product or active caspase was quantified. (C) Different concentrations of z-VAD-FMK

DISCUSSION

and supplementary Table 1).
Loss-of-function MCT-1 decreases Shc protein
levels that presumably work through either by epigenetic
modification or by post-transcriptional modulation
involving MCT-1 activity. In the former case, Shc
promoter function may be de-activated by targeting
MCT-1, similar to inhibition of p53 gene promoter by
overexpressing MCT-1 [28]. Shc promoter region has
the putative Sp1 binding sites [49]. The Sp1-dependent
gene transcription can be suppressed by the functional
p53 [50]. MCT-1 increases Sp1 expression in the nucleus
[25] and suppresses p53 mRNA homeostasis and p53
protein stability [26-28]. Therefore, the p53-mediated Sp1
reduction may be inversely elicited after MCT-1 depletion,
by which attributes to Shc gene inhibition (Fig. 1E and
1F). The association of MCT-1 with ribosome may be
another potential molecular mechanism in regulating the
expression profiling of many signaling pathways [51],
such as the Shc-Ras-MEK-ERK cascade. In the other

Knockdown of MCT-1 suppresses Shc signaling
pathway
Our current results verify that Shc isoforms are
differentially regulated by MCT-1 which directly affects
the signaling cascade of Shc-Ras-ERK. The most
significant effect occurs for the p66Shc expression examined
so far, presumably because of the unique tumorigenic
role of p66Shc in relation with MCT-1 oncogenic activity.
Direct impact on Shc signaling cascade explains why
gain-of-function MCT-1 promotes the proliferative rate
of cells [20], and induces Cyclin D1 accumulation and
Rb phosphorylation [21]. By supporting the xenograft
tumorigenicity data (Fig. 5 and 6), the clinical information
have first established the physiological relation between
MCT-1 and Shc in human cancer development (Table 1-3

cell death was detected in the MCT-1-silencing condition. (C) Exposure to DOX induced more cleavage of vimentin and PARP as well
as more active caspase 7 and caspase 3, especially in the MCT-1 knockdown cells. (D) Different concentrations of Camptothecin (CPT)
were administrated with A549 cells for 24 h. MCT-1 shRNA transfection confers higher cellular sensitivity to CPT than the control cells
(mock). (E) A549 cells were treated with 100 µM CPT alone or together with 50 µM z-VAD-FMK (z-VAD) for 24 h. The combination of

caspases [38, 42]. Aberrant induction of integrin β4,
stimulates malignant tumor progression and angiogenesis
[56, 57]. Thus, targeting integrin β4 has been predicted
as a rational approach for cancer and anti-angiogenic
therapies [58]. The stimulus of p53 accumulation induces
the activation of caspase 3 and 7, through which can
promote apoptosis and enhance degradation of integrin β4
and PARP in targeted suppression of MCT-1 (Fig. 2 and
3). Accordingly, the loss-of-function MCT-1 raises the
chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells (Fig. 4), implying that
targeting MCT-1 may enhance the therapeutic efficacy on
advanced and metastatic cancer.

Reduction of MCT-1 increases apoptotic event
Programmed cell death is a natural defender
against cancer development [53], and malfunction
of the apoptotic process can stimulate tumorigenesis
[54]. Tumor cells have a tendency to be more resistant
to environmental stress or chemotherapeutics partly
due to the inactivation of pro-apoptotic signaling or
the activation of anti-apoptotic pathway. In addition
to prevent genomic instability and tumor development
[55], the accumulation of p53 transcriptionally activates
many downstream genes which stimulate the proteolytic
activation of caspases to trigger cell death [40]. During
apoptosis, PARP and integrin β4 are cleaved by the active

with Grb2 [59, 60]. Disrupting the interaction of Shc and
Grb2 inhibits tumor growth of the xenograft mice [61],
telling that Shc pathway may be served as an ideal cancer
therapeutic target. Consistent with the results in vitro (Fig.
1C and 1D), significant inhibition of Shc expression in
tumorigenic process are identified after MCT-1 depletion
(Fig. 5 and 6), confirming that MCT-1 is a novel regulator
of the Shc pathway. Thereby, blockade of MCT-1 activity
potentially inhibits not only Shc signaling cascade but
also the oncogenicity and tumorigenicity involving
aberrant Shc activity. Clinical results also show important
correlation between high-activation of both MCT-1 and
Shc genes in different types of tumors. Given that the

Non-tumorigenic human mammary MCF-10A cells
were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (GIBCO, Grand
Island, NY) supplemented with 5% horse serum (HS)
(GIBCO), 20 ng/ml EGF (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene
Ltd., Rehovot, Israel), 10 µg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 100 units/ml
penicillin (GIBCO) and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO)
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37oC. Non-small cell human lung
carcinoma cell lines, H1299 and A549, were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO), 2
mM/ml L-glutamine (GIBCO), 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at
37oC. The pGeneClip MCTS1 shRNA (SA Biosciences
Corp, Frederick, MD) or the control shRNA (mock) were
transfected into cells using the jetPEI™ transfection
reagent (Polyplus-transfection, New York, NY), followed
by incubating with 0.5 µg/ml puromycin to select the line
with differential reduction of MCT-1.

Cell proliferative and survival rates were measured
by Cell Proliferation Kit I (Roche Diagnostics Corp.,
Basel, Switzerland). MCF-10A, H1299 and A549 cells
were seeded in a BD FalconTM 96-well microplate (5,000
cells per well) in triplicate and cultured in DMEM/F-12
complete medium with 5% HS or RPMI 1640 medium
with 10% FBS as indicated. At the specific time, 10 µl
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT)-labeling reagent was added to each
well for 4 h. The formazan crystals were dissolved
with 100 µl of Solubilization solution and incubated
overnight at 37°C before analyzing by the Infinite M200
Pro spectrophotometer (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf,
Switzerland) at an absorbance of 595 nm.
Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay. MCF10A cells were seeded at 1×104 cells per well and
incubated with the serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium and
different concentrations of Z-VAD for the indicated time.
To test cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents,
A549 cells were cultured at 2×104 cells per well with 10%
FCS containing RPMI 1640 medium and treated with 0.1
µM Taxol (Sigma), 1 µM Doxorubicin (DOX) (Sigma), or
different concentrations of Camptothecin (CPT) (Sigma)
for the indicated time.

Western blotting assay

Cell cycle profiling and programmed cell death

CytoBusterTM Protein Extraction Reagent
(Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) including Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma) and Phosphatase Inhibitor
Cocktail 2 (Sigma) was incubated with cells at 4oC
for 30 minutes (min). Cell extracts were clarified by
centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4oC, and
protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie
PlusTM Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo, Rockford, IL).
The protein samples (15 µg) were mixed with TRICINE
Sample Buffer (Protech Technology, Taipei, Taiwan) and
heated at 95oC for 7.5 min. The samples were resolved
on a 4–12% Bis/Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and then transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) using the
Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell
(Bio-Red Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The membranes
were blocked for 1 hour (h) in PBS with 5% DifcoTM Skim
Milk (BD Biosciences), hybridized with the indicated
Abs and reactivated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-

To analyze the cell cycle distribution, cells were
harvested by 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA, washed with
PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at -20oC. The cells
were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated
with 10 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) and 10
µg/ml RNase A in PBS (Sigma) at 4oC overnight. All
the suspension and adhesion cells were collected,
washed twice with PBS and stained with Annexin V
apoptosis detection kit (BD Bioscience) for 15 min
at room temperature. The Annexin V-positive cells
were analyzed by the BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Both PI and Annexin
V-FITC were excited at 488 nm, and the emissions were
determined by FL2 PMT (564-606 nm bandpass filter) and
FL1 PMT (515-545 nm bandpass filter). The results were
analyzed using the Windows Multiple Document Interface
(WinMDI), version 2.8 software developed by Scripps
Research Institute (La Jolla, CA).

Caspase 3 activity

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(Q-RT-PCR)

Caspase 3 Colorimetric Activity Assay Kit
(Millipore Corporation) was used to measure activity of
caspase 3 by conversion of a colorimetric substrate, AcDEVD-pNA. The cells were cultured for 5 days and
harvested by the Cell Lysis Buffer. The protein samples
(100 µg) were incubated with 5X Assay Buffer, 10 µl
Ac-DEVD-pNA and ddH2O in a total volume of 100 µl
at 37oC for 2 h. The spectrophotometric detection of the
chromophore p-nitroaniline (p-NA) was analyzed by the
Infinite® M200 Pro spectrophotometer at an absorbance
of 405 nm.

Total cellular RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). The quality and quantity of RNA were
determined by the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo). Total RNA was reversely-transcribed into
complementary DNA (cDNA) using the QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
The specific probes (FAM dye-labeled MGB quencher)
for MCT-1 (assay ID: Hs00273873_m1), Shc (assay ID:
Hs01050691_g1) and beta-actin (assay ID: Hs99999903_
m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Forster
City, CA). Q-RT-PCR was performed in triplicate in a 10
µl mixture, containing 4 ng cDNA, 0.5 µl TaqMan probe,
5 µl TaqMan PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and
2.5 µl deionized water (DNase-free and RNase-free).
By use of ABI Prism 7900 Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems), PCR reactions were conducted
as follows: 95oC for 10 min, 45 cycles of denaturing at
95oC for 15 seconds and annealing at 60oC for 1 min.
The mRNA level of the target gene was normalized to
β-actin mRNA level and calculated by the formula: Cycle
threshold (ΔCT) = Ct target gene – Ct internal control. The
relative mRNA level of each gene was determined by the
formula: ΔΔCT =ΔCT control group – Ct experimental
group. The fold change was calculated by the formula:
2-ΔΔCT.

Ras activity assay
Cells were starved in the serum-free media for 24 h
before serum activation for the indicated time. The active
Ras was isolated by the agarose-coupled Ras-binding
domain (RBD) of Raf-1 using the Ras Assay Reagent
(Millipore Corporation). The cells were extracted in
Magnesium-containing Lysis Buffer (MLB), 500 µg
protein samples were incubated with 10 µg Raf-1 RBDcoupled agarose in a total volume of 500 µl and then
gently rotated at 4oC for 1 h. Raf-1 RBD-coupled beads
were collected by quick centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4oC
and washed 3 times with ice-cold MLB. The active Ras
bound to the Raf-1 RBD beads were resolved by SDSPAGE and detected by H-Ras Ab.

Tumorigenicity of cancer cell xenograft mice

Trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic growth and
anchorage-independent growth assays

To assess the tumorigenic effect upon MCT-1
knockdown, H1299 (2×106) and A549 (1×106) lung
cancer cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the
flank region at both sites of 6 week-old female BALB/c
nude mice (BALB/cAnN-Foxnlnu/CrlNarl). All animal
studies were conducted in accordance with the Animal
Use Protocol approved by the National Health Research
Institutes (NHRI-IACUC-098074-A).
The tumor
development was monitored every 3 or 4 days, and
calculated by the formula: volume= 1/2 × L × W2, where
L is the length and W is the width.

Cells were cultured for 1 and 5 days in regular media
and then stained with 0.4% trypan blue in PBS for 10
min. Trypan blue-positive cells indicating the dead cells
without intact membrane were observed under a Nikon
ECLIPSE TS100 inverted microscope and photographed
by a Canon EOS 50D camera.
Cells were cultured at a low density (1000 cells/100
mm dish) in regular media for 2 weeks, the surviving
clonogenic cells were washed by PBS, fixed with 50%
and 100% methanol for 10 min each before staining
with 0.05% crystal violet in 2% ethanol for 30 min. The
clonogenic cells were photographed by a Canon Digital
IXUS 850 IS camera.
A549 cells were performed soft agar assay to
analyze the effect of anchorage-independent growth upon
MCT-1 knockdown as described [25].
