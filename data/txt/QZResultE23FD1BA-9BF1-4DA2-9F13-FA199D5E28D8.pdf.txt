Abstract
Ovarian carcinomas overexpress endothelin A receptors (ETAR)
and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). In these
cells, endothelin-1 (ET-1) triggers mitogenic and invasive
signaling pathways that are in part mediated by EGFR transactivation. Combined targeting of ETAR, by the specific ETAR
antagonist ZD4054, and of EGFR by the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib
(IRESSA), may offer improvements in ovarian carcinoma
treatment. In HEY and OVCA 433 ovarian carcinoma cells, ET-1
or EGF induced rapid activation of EGFR, p42/44 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT. ZD4054 was able to
reduce the ET-1–induced EGFR transactivation. Gefitinib significantly inhibited EGF- and ET-1–induced EGFR phosphorylation,
but incompletely reduced the ET-1–induced activation of
downstream targets. ZD4054 plus gefitinib resulted in a greater
inhibition of EGFR, MAPK, and AKT phosphorylation, indicating
the critical role of these interconnected signaling proteins.
ZD4054 effectively inhibited cell proliferation, invasiveness, and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Concomitantly, ZD4054 enhanced apoptosis and E-cadherin promoter
activity and expression. In both cell lines, the drug combination
resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation (65%),
invasion (52%), and VEGF production (50%), accompanied by a
2-fold increase in apoptosis. The coadministration of ZD4054
enhanced the efficacy of gefitinib leading to partial (82%) or
complete tumor regression on HEY ovarian carcinoma xenografts. Antitumor effects were paralleled by biochemical and
immunohistologic evidence of decreased vascularization, Ki-67,
matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), VEGF, MAPK and EGFR,
and enhanced E-cadherin expression. The cross-signaling
between the EGFR/ETAR pathways provides a rationale to
combine EGFR inhibitors with ETAR antagonists, identifying
new effective therapeutic opportunities for ovarian cancer.

Introduction
The lack of specific marker of early diagnosis makes epithelial
ovarian cancer the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in
Western world women (1). Although during the last decades,

overall survival has improved due to the use of new chemotherapy
regimens, the majority of patients will relapse and develop resistant
disease. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer
treatment are continuously explored (2). The endothelin (ET)
family is composed of three isopeptides, ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3,
which act through two distinct subtypes of G-protein coupled
receptors (i.e., ETA and ETB). The ETA receptor (ETAR) is highly
specific for ET-1, whereas ETBR binds ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 with the
same affinity (3). ET-1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology
of a wide range of human tumors, including ovarian carcinoma
(4–6). ET-1 and the ETAR are expressed in 85% of ovarian
carcinoma and their expression correlates with advanced stages
(6, 7). Moreover, ET-1 is present at high levels in ovarian tumor
ascites (8). In this tumor cells, ET-1 acts as an autocrine growth
factor selectively through the ETAR (5–10), and triggers an array of
multiple signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase–dependent AKT and
integrin-linked-kinase (7, 11), src-mediated epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) transactivation (12), and, finally,
p125 focal adhesion kinase and paxillin activation, which are
thought to transduce signals involved in tumor cell invasion. ET-1,
acting through ETAR, consistently induces also the activity of
multiple metastasis-related proteinases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator system (10). Moreover, ET-1 inhibits gap junction intercellular
communication by inducing phosphorylation of connexin 43,
allowing tumor cells to escape growth control and invasion (13).
Upon being activated, the ETAR mediates pleiotropic activities,
including enhanced cell proliferation, escape from apoptosis,
angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increased motility and invasiveness (14). These findings indicate that
activation of ETAR by ET-1 is a key mechanism in the cellular
signaling network promoting ovarian cancer growth and progression. These findings complement and extend the recent analysis of
gene expression profile of late-stage ovarian cancer whereby ETAR
has been identified as a metastasis-associated gene (14–16).
Moreover, gene expression profile associated with response to
chemotherapy in ovarian cancer identified ETAR as one of the
genes highly expressed in postchemotherapy samples compared
with untreated primary tumors (17). Besides ETAR, EGFR is
amplified and/or overexpressed in many human cancers, including
ovarian cancer, where it is frequently associated with poor
prognosis and has been correlated with tumor resistance to
chemotherapy, thus representing a critical therapeutic target
(18–22). Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) is a low molecular weight
quinazoline derivative that specifically inhibits the activation of
EGFR tyrosine kinase through competitive binding of the ATPbinding domain of the receptor (21). Preclinical activity was shown

in vivo by the inhibition of tumor growth in mice bearing HX62
ovarian carcinoma xenografts (22). Rapid regrowth was observed in
the majority of mice when the drug was discontinued, suggesting
that chronic administration is required to maintain control of
tumor proliferation. In spite of the early encouraging results
obtained with gefitinib alone or in combination with chemotherapy
in phase I/II studies conducted in platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer patients (23–25), recent studies suggest that gefitinib is well
tolerated but has minimal activity in patients with recurrent
ovarian carcinoma. Response to gefitinib associated with activating
mutation of EGFR catalytic domain was observed only in 3.5% of
these patients (26); therefore, other factors besides mutations could
account for this modest response. Cooperation and cross-talk
between redundant biochemical pathways appear to be the main
reasons for the failure of a therapy aimed at interfering with a
single specific molecular target. The lack of response to EGFR
inhibition may therefore suggest that the tumor can maintain
critical survival pathways through either constitutively activated
downstream mediators or alternative receptor signaling. ETAR has
been implicated in ligand-independent activation of EGFR (12).
Activation of redundant downstream signaling through ETAR may
override the effects of EGFR inhibitors, thus representing a possible
mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.
Recently, a molecular signature of lung cancer cells resistant to
EGFR inhibitors has been described, characterized by numerous
genes related to EMT, such as loss of E-cadherin expression.
Interestingly, restoring E-cadherin expression increases sensitivity
to EGFR inhibitor (27–29). Understanding the regulatory loops that
allow close coordination of EMT program and EGFR inhibitor
sensitivity may provide a novel strategy capable of overcoming the
occurrence of resistance and to increase the magnitude and
duration of response. Our previous results demonstrating that
ETAR blockade reverses EMT and restores E-cadherin expression
(7) provide the basis to test whether the addition of a specific ETAR
antagonist to gefitinib may increase the therapeutic activity of the
treatment. The predominant role played by ETAR in cancer has led
to the development of small molecules that antagonize the binding
of ET-1 to ETAR (30). Among various ETAR antagonists, ZD4054 is a
small molecule that potently and selectively binds to the ETAR,
blocking signal transduction pathways implicated in cancer cell
proliferation (31, 32).
We hypothesize that by blocking both the ETAR and EGFR
pathways, we can enhance antitumor effects achieved by either
single agent. In the present study, we tested in vitro and in vivo the
antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, anti-invasive, and proapoptotic
activities of ZD4054. The evidence of cross-talk between the EGFR
and ETAR pathways, along with the emerging role of endothelin
axis in ovarian tumorigenesis and progression, provides a rationale
for evaluating drugs that target these two pathways for ovarian
cancer treatment. Thus, in vitro and in vivo, the combination of
ZD4054 and gefitinib in ovarian carcinoma can maximally inhibit
not only cell proliferation and survival but also neovascularization
and downstream signaling pathways leading to cancer invasion,
EMT, and metastatic spread.

ET-1 (Peninsula Laboratories) was used at 100 nmol/L and incubated with
the cells for the indicated times. EGF (Upstate) was used at 10 ng/mL.
Pretreatment of cells with 1 Amol/L ZD4054 or gefitinib was done for
30 min before the addition of ET-1 of EGF.
Cell lines. Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, HEY and OVCA 433,
generously provided by Prof. Giovanni Scambia (Catholic University School
of Medicine, Rome, Italy), previously characterized for ET-1 receptor expression and for ET-1 production (5, 6), were cultured in DMEM containing 10%
FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37jC under 5% CO2-95% air. The cells
were serum starved by incubation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. All culture
reagents were from Invitrogen.
Cell proliferation assay. [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as
previously described (5). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at f80%
confluence (2  106 per well) and incubated in serum-free medium for
24 h to induce quiescence and 100 nmol/L ET-1 was added. Responses to all
treatments were assayed in sextuplicate, and results were expressed as the
means of three separate experiments.
Apoptosis assay. The induction of programmed cell death was
determined as previously described (9) by the cell death detection ELISA
Plus kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, 5  104 cell/well were seeded into
12-well plates. After a 48-h treatment, cells were lysed and the supernatant
was recovered and assayed for histone-associated DNA fragments, as
recommended by the manufacturer, at 405 nm by the use of a microplate
reader. The experiments were done in quadruplicate and repeated twice.
For detection of early apoptotic events, floating and adherent cells were
collected. Cells (1  106) were double stained with FITC-conjugated
Annexin V and propidium iodide using the Vybrant Apoptosis Kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes) and were immediately analyzed by cytofluorometric analysis.
Vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Serum-starved HEY
cells were plated at 1  106 per dish and treated for 24 h with 1 Amol/L
ZD4054 or 1 Amol/L Iressa, alone and in combination. The vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels in the cell conditioned
medium were determined in triplicate by ELISA using the Quantikine
Human VEGF immunoassay kit (R&D Systems). The sensitivity of the assay
is <5.0 pg/mL. Intra-assay variation is 5.4% and interassay variation is 7.3%.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates obtained from cell cultures or homogenized HEY tumor specimens were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–12.5%)
and revealed by Western blotting using antibody to VEGF (Sigma), or
EGFR, or phospho–845-EGFR, or phospho-AKT, or AKT, and phospho-p42/
44 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK, caspase-3 (Cell Signalling), or to E-cadherin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were developed with the enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The
membranes were reprobed with anti–h-actin to assure the equal amount of
protein (Oncogene, CN Biosciences, Inc.). The proteins were visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) and quantified using NIH image program (Scion).
Luciferase reporter gene assay. To measure the transcriptional activity
of E-cadherin promoter, 3  105 cells per well were transiently transfected
using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.5 Ag pGL2 Ecad3/luc
construct (kindly provided by Dr. E.R. Fearon, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, MI), or with empty control vectors (Promega). All constructs were
cotransfected with pCMV-h-galactosidase plasmid (Promega). After 24 h of
transfection, serum-starved cells were treated with ET-1 and/or inhibitors
for additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was determined in the cell lysates
using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to hgalactosidase activity. The mean of three independent experiments done
in sextuplicate was reported.
Small interfering RNA treatment. HEY cells were transfected with
100 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes against ETAR mRNA
(SMART pool) or scrambled mock siRNA obtained commercially (Dharmacon). siRNA transfection using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was
done according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h later
and ETAR mRNA and protein levels were determined. In the luciferase assay,
cells were transfected with 0.5 Ag pGL2 Ecad3/luc construct 24 h after being
transfected with 100 nmol/L ETAR siRNA. Cells were then treated with ET-1
(100 nmol/L) and harvested after 24 h.

Chemoinvasion assay. Chemoinvasion assay was carried out with a
48-well modified Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe) and 8 Am pore size
polyvinyl pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate Nucleopore filters (Costar) as
previously described (10). The filters were coated with an even layer of
0.5 mg/mL Matrigel (BD Transduction Laboratories). The lower compartment of the chamber was filled with ET-1 (100 nmol/L) and/or ZD4054
(1 Amol/L). Serum-starved HEY cells (5  105/mL) were placed in the upper
compartment (55 AL/well). ZD4054 was previously added to the cells and
preincubated for 15 min at 37jC. In the chemoinvasion assay done using
ETAR siRNA, HEY cells were transfected for 48 h and then incubated in the
upper compartment. After 24 h of incubation at 37jC, the filters were
removed, stained with Diff-Quick (Merz-Dade), and the migrated cells in 10
high-power fields were counted. Each experimental point was analyzed in
triplicate.
Xenografts in nude mice. Female athymic (nu+/nu+) mice, 4 to 6 weeks
of age (Charles River Laboratories), were treated following the guidelines for
animal experimentation of the Italian Ministry of Health. Mice were injected
s.c. into one flank with 1.5  106 viable HEY cells. After 7 days, when tumor
reached f0.2 to 0.3 cm in diameter, mice were randomized in groups
(n = 10) to receive different treatments. One group was treated i.p. for
21 days with ZD4054 (diluted in PBS) at the daily dose of 10 mg/kg/d.
Control mice were injected with drug vehicle. For combination treatment
study, one group was treated i.p. for 21 days with ZD4054 (10 mg/kg/d), one
group was treated for 21 days p.o. with gefitinib (125 mg/kg/d, diluted in
polyethylene glycol 400), and one group was treated with ZD4054 in

combination with gefitinib. Control animals received equal volume of
polyethylene glycol 400 p.o. as animal receiving gefitinib and were injected
with equal volume of saline solution as animal receiving ZD4054. On day
40 after tumor injection, tumors were removed from control and treated
mice, and snap frozen for immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis.
Tumor size was measured with calipers and was calculated using the
formula p/6  larger diameter  (smaller diameter)2.
Immunohistochemistry. Indirect immunoperoxidase stain of tumor
xenografts was done on acetone-fixed 4-Am tissue sections as previously
described (30). Briefly, sections were incubated with monoclonal rat antimouse CD31 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; generously
donated by Dr. A. Mantovani, Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy), anti–Ki-67
monoclonal antibody (clone MIB1; Ylem), and anti–MMP-2 monoclonal
antibody (Oncogene Research Products). The avidin-biotin assays were
done using the Vectastain Elite kit ( for nonmurine primary antibodies) and
the Vector MOM immunodetection kit ( for murine primary antibodies)
obtained from Vector Laboratories. Mayer’s hematoxylin was used as
nuclear counterstain. Negative control stain was represented by sections in
which the incubation with the primary antibody was either omitted or
substituted by isotype-matched immunoglobulins, respectively. The evaluation of MVD was done by two independent observers on a 200 field
according to the criteria of Weidner et al. (33). Ki-67 positivities were
expressed as the percentage of tumor cells with nuclear staining counted in
five separate 40 microscopic fields (at least 200 cells per field were
counted).

done using commercial software (SPSS).

Results
Combination of ZD4054 and gefitinib inhibits the phosphorylation of EGFR, p42/44 MAPK, and AKT and the
proliferation in ovarian carcinoma cells. To evaluate the effect
of the ETAR-specific antagonist ZD4054 on the proliferation of
ovarian carcinoma cells, we used two established cell lines, HEY
and OVCA 433. They express in fact functional ET-1 and EGF highaffinity receptors (in an average of 45,500 receptors per cell with a
K d 0.10 nmol/L for ET-1 and 52,700 receptors per cell with a K d
0.25 nmol/L for EGF) and secrete high levels of their corresponding
ligands, ET-1, and transforming growth factor a for both of which
an autocrine stimulation has been implicated in ovarian tumor
progression (5–7, 34). The same autocrine loop occurs in both cell
lines as indicated by a significant constitutive EGFR, MAPK, and
AKT phosphorylation observed upon serum starvation. In HEY
cells, exogenous ET-1 and EGF were able to induce a rapid EGFR
transactivation and a further increases in the activation of
phospho-p42/44 MAPK and p-AKT (Fig. 1A). Although ZD4054
was able to reduce the ET-1–induced EGFR transactivation,
gefitinib significantly inhibited EGF- and ET-1–induced p-EGFR,
but incompletely reduced the ET-1–induced phosphorylation of
MAPK and AKT (Fig. 1A). This indicates that dual alternative
pathways converge on MAPK and AKT activation, one EGFRdependent, and the other EGFR-independent. Combination of
ZD4054 plus gefitinib resulted in a greater inhibition of EGFR,
MAPK, and AKT phosphorylation, indicating the critical role of

these interconnected signaling. Similar results were obtained in
OVCA 433 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The above results prompted us to analyze the contribution of the
gefitinib-sensitive pathway to the mitogenic effect of ET-1 in both
ovarian cancer cells. Using the thymidine incorporation assay, we
observed that the stimulatory activity of ET-1 was completely
blocked in the presence of ZD4054 (Fig. 1B). In both cell lines,
combination of ZD4054 with gefitinib, which prevents the
interaction of endogenous ligands, caused a significant inhibition
of the basal proliferation rate. The activity of 100 nmol/L ET-1 on
thymidine incorporation was significantly decreased by combination treatment in both cell lines (60%; P V 0.005).
The finding that EGFR transactivation in ovarian carcinoma cells
is in part responsible for the mitogenic signaling of agonist-induced
ETAR activation, and our previous demonstration that ET-1 exerts
additive proliferative effects in the presence of maximally effective
EGF concentration (12, 34), suggest that the coexistence of ET-1
and EGF autocrine circuits in tumor cells could provide maximal
growth advantage that may be blocked by the combined regimen of
ZD4054 and gefitinib.
ZD4054 reverts EMT, restores E-cadherin expression, and
inhibits ovarian cancer cell invasion. Based on the report that
increased E-cadherin expression enhances the magnitude and
duration of EGFR inhibition response (27–29) and that ET-1
promotes EMT selectively through ETAR (7), we tested whether
ZD4054 could revert EMT, increase E-cadherin expression, and thus
inhibit ovarian cancer invasiveness. Interestingly, in the presence of
ZD4054, a large percentage of HEY (Fig. 2A) and OVCA 433 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2) reverted to an epithelial phenotype. To
determine whether EMT-associated molecular alterations have
occurred in these cells, we examined the effect of ETAR blockade,
achieved either pharmacologically or by RNA interference (siRNA),
on the expression of E-cadherin. ZD4054 and transfection with

ETAR siRNA, which markedly reduced the expression of ETAR at
mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S3), resulted in a
significant increase in E-cadherin expression in both cell lines
(Fig. 2B). This effect was complemented by an enhancement of
E-cadherin promoter activity (Fig. 2C) and by a reduction of the
basal and ET-1–induced cell invasion (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
these data indicate that ZD4054 could revert EMT-associated
morphologic and molecular changes, restoring E-cadherin expression and activity, and inhibiting ovarian cancer cell invasion. This
suggested that the addition of ZD4054 to gefitinib treatment may
increase the therapeutic activity of the latter.
Combination of ZD4054 and gefitinib induces apoptosis.
Because ET-1 is a survival factor, we determined whether the
antiproliferative effect of ZD4054 resulted in the induction of
programmed cell death. As shown in Fig. 3A, ZD4054 treatment
increased the percentage of apoptotic HEY and OVCA 433 cells
after 48 h of treatment (P V 0.05 compared with control), by
measuring the histone-associated DNA fragments. Next, we
evaluated the potential combined proapoptotic effect of treatment with ZD4054 and gefitinib. The addition of ZD4054
significantly increased gefitinib-induced apoptosis (P V 0.005) in
both cell lines (Fig. 3A). Early apoptotic cells were also
determined by Annexin V staining. Treatment of HEY cells with
ZD4054 and gefitinib increased the number of early apoptotic
cells to 37% and 45%, respectively. As expected, the induction of

apoptosis was higher when cells were treated with both drugs
(72%; Fig. 3B). In HEY cells, combination treatment also resulted
in increased cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, compared
with single agents (Fig. 3C), suggesting that combination
treatment of gefitinib plus ZD4054 in a cooperative fashion
activates apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathway. These
results established that ETAR and EGF-activated redundant
survival pathways were effectively affected by combined treatment with ZD4054 and gefitinib.
Combination of ZD4054 and gefitinib affects VEGF production and cell invasion. ETAR and EGFR are capable of regulating
angiogenesis by promoting the tumor production of VEGF (8).
Untreated HEY and OVCA 433 cells secreted f400 pg  106 cells of
VEGF. Treatment with either ZD4054 or gefitinib alone caused an
f32% inhibition of VEGF secretion (P < 0.001) compared with
control. The combination of ZD4054 with gefitinib produced a
further inhibitory effect, reaching almost 50% reduction of VEGF
secretion (P < 0.002; Fig. 4A). Combined treatment significantly
inhibited also the basal and ET-1–induced invasion of HEY cells
(P < 0.001; Fig. 4B). These results show that combined ETAR and
EGF blockade results in reduced expression of VEGF and inhibition
of cell invasion.
Combination of ZD4054 and gefitinib inhibits tumor growth
in nude mice. We studied whether the combination of ZD4054
and gefitinib could maximally impair tumor xenograft growth

compared with either treatment alone. To this end, we used HEY
cells that display high expression of both ETAR and EGFR and, as
shown above, are highly responsive to both drugs in vitro. For
combined treatment, we selected a 10 mg/kg/d dose of ZD4054,
because capable of inducing a 69% tumor inhibition with no
associated toxicity, given i.p. for 21 days in combination with oral
administration of gefitinib (125/mg/kg/d for 21 days). Tumor
growth inhibition achieved with ZD4054 was comparable with that
observed with gefitinib. Further tumor growth inhibition (82% of
controls) was elicited by the combined regimen of ZD4054 and
gefitinib. The comparison of the time course of tumor-growth
curves by two-sided ANOVA was statistically significant (P < 0.001;
Fig. 5). As shown in Table 1, the combined treatment was highly
effective with no histologic evidence of HEY tumors in 4 of 10
mice. The dual treatment at the dose and schedule tested was well
tolerated, as evaluated by the absence of weight loss or other signs
of acute or delayed toxicity. To establish the duration of the
combined ZD4054 and gefitinib treatment bioactivity, we extended
the follow-up of the treated animal up to 60 days. As compared
with control tumor xenografts, the growth delay in established
tumors persisted for up to 4 weeks after the termination of the
combined treatment.
Effect of combined treatment of ZD4054 and gefitinib on
proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and EMT-related effectors. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done
on HEY tumor xenografts, freshly excised on day 40 after tumor cell
injection. Analysis of the cell proliferation rate, evaluated by Ki-67
immunostaining, revealed a marked decrease in the tumors treated
with gefitinib and ZD4054 (Fig. 5B; Table 1). Ki-67 protein
expression was decreased by 37% and 30% in tumors treated with
ZD4054 or gefitinib alone, respectively, compared with untreated
tumors, whereas Ki-67 was decreased by 46% in tumors treated
with ZD4054 and gefitinib. The inhibition of Ki-67 by dual receptor
blockade was statistically different from that observed with either
ZD4054 or gefitinib treatment alone (P < 0.02 and P < 0.001,
respectively).

Tumor-induced vascularization, which was quantified as microvessel density (MVD) using antibody against CD31, was significantly reduced after treatment with ZD4054. A further significant
inhibition of tumor neovascularization (78%; P < 0.0001) was
observed after combined treatment compared with either ZD4054
(62%; P < 0.0001) or gefitinib (45%; P < 0.001) treatment alone
(Fig. 5B; Table 1). HEY tumor xenografts were also analyzed for
VEGF expression by Western blots (Fig. 5C). We observed a marked
reduction of VEGF expression in animals treated with combination
regimens that was proportional to the reduction of vascularization,
quantified as MVD. Activation of ETAR in HEY cells leads to upregulation of MMP secretion and activation (10). In this context, we
evaluated whether ETAR blockade inhibits MMP-2 expression.
ZD4054 treatment and, above all, the combination of the two
agents significantly reduced the percentage of HEY cells positive
for MMP-2 (Fig. 5B). Analysis of EMT determinant in ovarian
xenografts revealed a marked increase of E-cadherin expression in
ZD4054-treated mice and especially in ZD4054 plus gefitinibtreated mice compared with control (Fig. 5C).
We next examined the expression of phospho-EGFR and
phospho-p42/44 MAPK in tumors removed from the animals. Both
phospho-EGFR and phosho-p42/44 MAPK expression were almost
completely abrogated compared with either control or single-agent
groups (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Ovarian cancer remains the most common cause of death
among gynecologic malignancies (1). Following cytoreductive
surgery, chemotherapy has been the mainstay for ovarian cancer
treatment (35). The majority of women with advanced ovarian
cancer will develop drug-resistant disease with an overall 5-year
survival V50%. The identification of new effective biology-based
therapy is therefore mandatory. The ET-1/ETAR autocrine
pathway has a crucial role in stromal-cancer cell interactions
that promote tumor growth, neovascularization, EMT, and

metastatic spread (14). Therefore, interfering with ETAR and their
downstream targets might provide an opportunity to develop new
mechanism-based strategies for cancer management. Among the
small molecules capable of inhibiting the binding of the
endogenous ligand to the ETAR, ZD4054 is a potent and high
selective ETAR antagonist (31). ZD4054 inhibits ET-1–induced
mitogenic activity in ovarian carcinoma cell lines (32). Moreover,
ZD4054, through the inactivation of bcl-2 and activation of
caspase-3 increases apoptosis and inhibits VEGF production in
ovarian cancer cells. Preclinical activity was shown in vivo by the
inhibition of tumor growth in mice bearing HEY ovarian
carcinoma xenografts. Of interest, ZD4054 in vivo enhances the
effects of chemotherapeutic agent such as taxanes, with no side
effect (36). Along this line, to offer broader therapeutic prospects,
we evaluated the therapeutic potential of ZD4054 in combined

therapy by targeting signaling networks that are selectively
exploited in ovarian cancer and oversee multiple aspects of
tumor cell maintenance and progression. We have previously
shown that in ovarian cancer cells, EGFR transactivation by ETAR
is in part responsible for MAPK activation, prostaglandin E2 and
VEGF secretion, MMP activity, and ovarian cancer cell invasion
(37, 38). Cross-talk between cell surface receptors, a main
modality to expand the cellular communication signaling
network, is also implicated in the acquired resistance to targeted
therapies aiming at a single oncogenomic pathway. Therefore,
disabling EGFR and ETAR using gefitinib in combination with
ZD4054 could be of benefit by increasing tumor cell death and
intersecting escaping signaling networks that may override the
effect of EGFR inhibitors. In this study, we showed that not only
cell proliferation and survival, but also invasiveness, VEGF

production, and downstream signaling molecules, including
phospho-p42/44 MAPK and p-AKT, can be maximally inhibited
in vitro and in vivo by the combination of ZD4054 and gefitinib,
suggesting that a contributing mechanism to tumor growth
escape from EGFR inhibition could be the aberrant activation of
downstream molecular effectors, and the increased angiogenic
and invasive potential. These results are in agreement and extend
those of Bianco et al. (39, 40), which have shown, using human
GEO colon cancer cells, that EGFR inhibitor-resistant cells exhibit
a 5- to 10-fold increase in VEGF production as well as in certain
intracellular signal pathways that are downstream to the
activated EGFR, compared with sensitive cells.
The recent demonstration that reversion of EMT and restoration
of E-cadherin expression increases sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in
lung cancer cell lines may help to develop biomarkers and strategies to overcome resistance to EGFR inhibitors (27–29). EMT is
a key step in the progression of tumors toward metastasis and
invasion and may well play a role in determining sensitivity to EGFR
inhibitors (28). E-cadherin expression is regulated by ET-1/ETAR
autocrine pathway and its expression is increased after ETAR
antagonist treatment in vitro and in vivo in ovarian cancer (7). In
this study, we show that ZD4054 treatment reverts EMT, enhances
E-cadherin expression and promoter activity, and inhibits invasiveness in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, blockade of ETAR by ZD4054,
restoring E-cadherin expression, could increase sensitivity to EGFR
inhibitors, suggesting that E-cadherin expression not only is a
potential marker of response to EGFR inhibitors but also plays
a role in the mechanism underlying response to these drugs.
Therefore, concomitant blockade of ETAR and EGFR could represent
an attractive therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance to EGFR
inhibitor.

Because response rate to gefitinib seems to be limited to the
tumors harboring mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of
EGFR, new approaches are needed to increase the overall efficacy
of getifinib. In this context, combination therapy may be especially
beneficial in the majority of tumors lacking mutations of functional
significance because it potentially provides a second mechanism
for inhibiting the EGFR through reduction of its transactivation by
ETAR and by restoring E-cadherin, resulting into increased
response to gefitinib in ovarian cancer cells.
There is now a large body of preclinical evidence showing that
simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways is a suitable strategy
in the treatment of cancer (41). In this context, experimental
models have been used to show that significant and sustained
antitumor activity can be obtained through the combination of
selective anti-EGFR agents with other antisignal transduction
agents. The tumor growth inhibition, the effect on downstream
signaling molecules, and the decreased tumor cellularity and
vascularity in response to gefitinib and ZD4054 treatment suggest
that this drug combination by simultaneously disabling multiple
signaling circuities activated by EGFR and ETAR may provide novel
perspective in cancer therapy.
