Abstract
Genomic copy number aberrations and corresponding transcriptional deregulation in the cancer genome have been
suggested to have regulatory roles in cancer development and
progression. However, functional evaluation of individual
genes from lengthy lists of candidate genes from genomic
data sets presents a significant challenge. Here, we report
effective gene selection strategies to identify potential driver
genes based on systematic integration of genome scale data of
DNA copy numbers and gene expression profiles. Using
regional pattern recognition approaches, we discovered the
most probable copy number–dependent regions and 50
potential driver genes. At each step of the gene selection
process, the functional relevance of the selected genes was
evaluated by estimating the prognostic significance of the
selected genes. Further validation using small interference
RNA–mediated knockdown experiments showed proof-ofprinciple evidence for the potential driver roles of the genes
in hepatocellular carcinoma progression (i.e., NCSTN and
SCRIB). In addition, systemic prediction of drug responses
implicated the association of the 50 genes with specific
signaling molecules (mTOR, AMPK, and EGFR). In conclusion,
the application of an unbiased and integrative analysis of
multidimensional genomic data sets can effectively screen for
potential driver genes and provides novel mechanistic and
clinical insights into the pathobiology of hepatocellular
carcinoma. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):4059–66]

Introduction
Microarray technologies have been used to define the global
gene expression patterns in human cancer and have successfully
identified gene expression signatures or novel tumor classes as well
as prognostic information (1–4). However, because the gene
expression profile is only a snapshot of complex genetic
interactions, it is difficult to discriminate the genes driving
the neoplastic process (‘‘driver’’ genes) from by-stander genes
(‘‘passenger’’ genes). Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses have also identified DNA copy number changes in

many cancers. Some of these copy number–altered loci have been
linked to disease pathogenesis and clinical behavior (5–8), but
many of the copy number–altered genes do not seem to be
expressed. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that the combined
analysis of both data sets may reveal the causally altered genes in
both copy numbers and corresponding gene expression (9–12).
However, dauntingly complex genomic and epigenomic interactions in cancer and the current limitations in sensitivity and
specificity of genomic data may impede the identification of the
regulatory genes (13). It is therefore challenging to evaluate the
biological function and clinical utility of the lengthy candidate
genes obtained from genomic data.
In this study, we aimed to establish a gene selection strategy to
identify potential driver genes by integrating genomic data of copy
numbers and gene expression profiles. Guiding our gene selection
process by estimating the prognostic significance of the selected
genes, we identified 50 potential driver genes. Further computational and experimental interrogations suggested that the identified genes represent potential driver genes for hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCC); providing both new insights into the pathobiology of liver cancer and therapeutic opportunities.

Materials and Methods
Comparative genomic hybridization profiling. Genomic DNA of 15
HCC samples and a normal reference liver were extracted using DNeasy
extraction kit (Qiagen). After labeling tumors and a reference normal liver
DNA samples with Cy5 and Cy3 fluorescent dye, respectively, hybridizations
and data acquisition were performed following the instructions of the
manufacturer (Nimblegen). The raw data were normalized as described
previously (14).
Generation of the t statistic and the transcriptome correlation
maps. The regional copy number alteration was estimated by a t statistic–
based sliding window approach, the t statistic map (TM). Before
constructing TM, considering the absolute copy number values exceeding
0.5 in at least three samples to be significant, 309,939 out of 3,080,000 probes
were identified as having nontrivial changes. TM scores were calculated as
the t statistic values which were obtained by applying a one-sample t test
on the probe values for 15 samples within a moving window. We chose
100 Kb as the best-fit window size as it most accurately reflects the genomic
copy number changes when various different window sizes (100 Kb, 1 Mb,
and 10 Mb) were tested (data not shown). The TM scores generated by
fewer than five probes in a moving window were regarded as missing values.
The threshold for significant TM score was determined as the highest TM
score from 100 random data sets which were generated by randomly
ordering the probe positions. Significant TM regions were determined by a
segmentation algorithm. The probes above the threshold were determined
as valid probes. If a valid probe was not neighbored within 100 Kb of
another valid probe, it was regarded invalid. Then, if the valid probes were
neighbored over 5 Mb, the probe position between them was segmented.
Segments less than 100 Kb were excluded.

t statistic values of the copy numbers in 15 HCCs with a moving window size of 100 Kb. B, gene expression profiles of 139 HCC samples in the order of chromosomal

Regional concordance of transcriptional regulation in 139 HCC
expression profiles were constructed using the transcriptome correlation
map (TCM), as described previously (13). Briefly, for each gene, the sum of
pair-wise Pearson’s correlation coefficients of the gene expression levels in
neighboring n genes was calculated. Moving window size was determined
to include the largest significant genes with the smallest neighboring genes
(n = 24). The threshold for significant TCM values and the segments were
determined by the same algorithms used in the TM analysis.
Estimation of the prognostic values of gene sets. The prognostic value
(P 0) of a selected gene set was evaluated by using a clustering algorithm and
log rank test as described previously (4). Then, a permutation test was
performed to compare the prognostic value of a selected region with those
from other regions. Two thousand random data sets were generated by
randomly selecting the same number of genes from outside the selected
regions (or genes) to be tested. For each random data set, hierarchical
clustering was performed to stratify the HCCs into two groups, and the log
rank test P value (P m) between the groups was calculated. Iterative
hierarchical clustering for the 2,000 random data sets was performed by a
command-line version of Cluster 3.0 (15). The significance of the
permutation test was taken as the frequency of events P m < P 0 from the
2,000 trials. Prognostic impact score (PIS) was calculated as —log10
(permutation P value). A permutation P < 0.05 (PIS > 1.3) was regarded as
significant.

Small interference RNA–mediated gene knockdown. HepG2 and
HuH-7 cells were transfected with siGENOME SMARTpool small interference RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon) for the selected target genes using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Nontargeting siRNA (siGENOME Non-Targeting Pool no. 1 siRNA) was used
as control. After 96 h of incubation with siRNAs, the cell viability was
assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay.
Screening of therapeutic drugs using in trans correlated gene
signatures. Raw data of Connectivity Map (build01) with two different
Affymetrix platforms (i.e., hgu133a and HT-hgu133a) were downloaded from
the authors’ web site4 and normalized independently using the RMA
method implemented in BioConductor.5 For each of the in trans gene
signatures, positive or negative signatures were assigned according to the
algebraic sign of the correlation coefficient of each gene. For each treatment
instance, the average connectivity score for the in trans gene signatures was
calculated as the representative connectivity score (S avg). The connectivity
scores (Si ) for each in trans gene signature to drug treatment instance (i)
were calculated based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the significance of

Results
Comparison of gene copy number and transcription levels
in HCC. We generated fine-scale whole genome copy number
profiles of 15 HCC samples using comparative genomic hybridization microarrays containing 3,080,000 isothermal oligonucleotide
probes. To represent the HCC heterogeneity, we selected five tumor
samples from each of the subgroups of A, B, and HB, which were
previously defined as having homogeneous expression patterns
with prognostic differences (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 1, 4).
First, we screened for the copy number–altered regions in HCC by
applying the TM method. TM was optimized to identify
chromosomal regions with low stringent but high regional
concordance of copy number changes, which yielded 57 TM
regions. These regions were highly concordant with previous
findings including the recurrent gains at 1q, 3q, 6p, 7q, 8q, 17q, 20q,

22q, and the losses at 1p, 6q, 8p, 9p, 14q, 16q, and 17p (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Table 2A; refs. 7, 10, 13, 17, 18).
To assess the chromosomal regional influence of the gene
expression, we next rearranged the previous 139 HCC gene
expression data (4) according to a sequence map of the human
genome (hg17), which revealed a strong regional concordance of
gene expression patterns across the heterogeneous tumor samples
(Fig. 1B). This regional pattern can be shown more clearly with a
TCM. TCM was previously used to identify concordant regional
coexpression which was thought to be largely due to the copy
number alteration (Fig. 1C; ref. 19). With a TCM, we identified
48 regions in which gene expression levels were likely to be copy
number–dependent (Supplementary Table S2B). Remarkably high
TCM scores were observed in chromosome 8, implying strong
influence of the copy numbers on gene expression levels. This
agrees well with the previous studies indicating marked copy
number aberration of chromosome 8 and its regulatory role in
cancer development and progression (20, 21). We then crosscompared the TM and TCM regions, which yielded 25 overlapped
common regions (CR) spanning 112.8 Mb and containing 580 genes

test P values calculated from the selected gene sets (P 0, red line ). B, Kaplan-Meier plot analyses and log rank tests for overall survival and recurrence-free survival (C )

(Supplementary Table S2C). These regions may represent the most
plausible regions in which copy numbers and expressions are
concomitantly deregulated.
Prognostic effect of the copy number–dependent regions.
We hypothesized that if genomic alterations of the genes in CR are
critical events during HCC development, the gene expression
patterns in CR would be well associated with patient prognosis. We
evaluated the prognostic relevance of the selected regions by
calculating PIS, which may represent the relative prognostic
significance compared with the nonselected regions. The TM and
TCM regions showed significant log rank test P values, but their
PIS were not significant compared with the other regions (Fig. 2A).
However, the genes residing in the CRs showed a significant prognostic value (PIS = 1.62), which may suggest that the genes in CR
play regulatory roles in the HCC progression (Fig. 2A). In particular,
4 out of the 25 CR segments (CR1, 1q21.3–23.2; CR3, 1q42.11–42.12;
CR13, 7q36.1; and CR20, 8q24.11–24.22) were highly predictive for
patient survival (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B). CR13 was significant in predicting tumor recurrence as well as survival (Fig. 2C). Deregulated

genes in these regions (1q21, 1q42, 7q36, and 8q24) may therefore
have a high probability of functioning as potential driver genes.
Screening of the potential driver genes. Next, we tested
whether the previous correlation-based gene selection method
(9, 11) can identify the potential driver genes which have
prognostic relevance. Before gene selection, we evaluated the
genomewide influence of all copy number changes on gene
expression. The distribution correlation coefficients showed
significant global influence of the copy number changes on the
gene expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, the
copy number profile of each sample was best correlated with its
corresponding expression levels, demonstrating that the overall
copy number changes substantially reflected the gene expression
profiles in each individual genome (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Confident that the copy number changes were strongly reflected
in the corresponding gene expression levels, we selected 379
correlated copy number alteration (corCNA) genes based on the
correlation between the expression levels and the copy numbers
(P < 0.01, r > 0.649, Pearson’s correlation test, false discovery

nodules (n = 17, blue ), early HCC (n = 18,
pink ), and advanced HCC (n = 17, red)
are indicated with different colors in D .
The significance of the correlation
coefficients was evaluated by 10,000 random
permutation tests (P = 0.042, P = 0.005,
respectively).

rate = 0.0019). To validate the correlation by an independent
method, we measured the copy numbers of two corCNA genes
(POLR2K and C1orf43) in 52 HCC samples using quantitative PCR
(Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). However, the prognostic effect of
the 379 genes was not significantly different from the noncorrelated genes (PIS = 0.76) even though the log rank test revealed
a significant difference (Fig. 3A, top). We next selected the corCNA
genes residing in CR, which yielded 50 genes. Strikingly, these 50
corCNA genes showed a strong prognostic effect (P = 5.06  10 6;

PIS = 2.03; Fig. 3A, middle). This result suggests that our gene
selection strategy using the regional pattern recognition approach
can effectively select the functionally relevant genes. Thus, we
reasoned that these 50 genes were the most probable candidate
driver genes (Table 1).
Interestingly, of the 50 corCNA genes, 30 genes resided in 1q
(n = 8) and 8q (n = 22), which were previously shown to have copy
number gains at the early stage of HCC development (7). The
prevalence of 1q and 8q genes among 50 corCNA genes is unlikely

to be due to the gene abundance in those regions (P = 9.42  10 5,
hypergeometric test). These 30 genes in the ‘‘early event’’ regions
(1q21.3–42.12 and 8q21.13–24.13) showed the most significant
prognostic relevance (P = 1.32  10 7; PIS = 3.30; Fig. 3A, bottom),
indicating the importance of the early dysregulation of these genes
in HCC development. The prognostic values of the 50 or 30 1q/8q
corCNA genes were further validated by two independent HCC
data sets (SNU; ref. 22 and GSE6764; ref. 2) using class prediction
algorithms ( for details see Supplementary Methods). The tumor
classes defined by the expression similarity of the 50 or 30 genes
could successfully predict the prognostic outcome of HCC in the
independent data sets (Supplementary Fig. S2; Table S3), supporting the robustness and consistency of our finding.
The enrichment of the 1q and 8q genes among the 50 corCNA
genes raised the possibility that the gene expression alterations at
1q and 8q might concomitantly occur during the early stage of
HCC development. We observed that the average copy numbers of
1q and 8q corCNA genes were correlated to each other (r = 0.564,
P = 0.028; Fig. 3B). In parallel, the gene expression levels of 1q and
8q corCNA genes were also correlated in our 139 HCC data set
(r = 0.333; P = 6.17  10 5, permutation P = 0.042; Fig. 3C), and this
was validated in an independent 35 HCC data set (GSE6764,
r = 0.398; P = 0.017; Fig. 3D). In addition, the result from GSE6764
also showed that the coexpression levels of the 1q and 8q genes
corresponded with the pathologic staging of the liver (cirrhosis,
dysplasia, and early HCC), and advanced HCC (n = 65, r = 0.609;
P = 7.11  10 8, permutation P = 0.005; Fig. 3D). Permutation tests
from 10,000 random trials indicated that our findings are not likely
to be observed by chance. Taken together, the 30 corCNA genes
might be coamplified and coexpressed during the early stage and
play critical roles in HCC development and progression.
Functional assessment and identification of therapeutic
targets for the 50 genes. Because the 50 genes were selected by
unbiased screening, we next examined their potential driver roles.
We randomly chose 11 genes from the 50 genes to include the copy
number–gained genes in the distinct chromosomes (CCT3, SCRIB,
PYCR2, HSF1, NCSTN, EPHB4, MTDH, CCNE1, RRM2B, TATDN1, and
POLR2K) and tested the siRNA-mediated knockdown effects on the
cancer cell viability. Of the 11 genes, 5 siRNAs for SCRIB, NCSTN,
HSF1, TATDN1, and POLR2K significantly reduced the viability of
both HepG2 and HuH-7 liver cancer cell lines (P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). In
particular, the loss of NCSTN and SCRIB showed the most potent
growth inhibition (P < 0.001) supporting the potential driver role of
these genes in HCC development and making them attractive
therapeutic targets. The knockdown of each five effective target
genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR,
and its target selectivity was validated by two independent siRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These results show that our screening
strategy can successfully identify novel therapeutic targets for HCC.
The 50 potential driver genes were identified by computational and
experimental methods. However, the global influence of the 50
genes on cell function might be mediated by their target effector
genes. We therefore sought to identify the putative effector genes
whose expression levels were correlated in trans with expression of
each driver gene (P < 0.001, Pearson’s correlation test). Overall, the
in trans correlated gene sets (15–1,606) were enriched with the
cancer-dominant functions such as protein transport/translation,
oxidative stress, RNA processing/DNA replication, and metabolism/immune-related functions; this may support their representative roles for the effector genes (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Considering the in trans correlated genes as putative effectors for

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

the 50 genes, we hypothesized that the disruption of the expression
of the in trans correlated genes would interrupt HCC development.
To test this hypothesis, we used Connectivity Map, an analytic
resource of gene expression profiles for drug responses (16). For
each of the 50 in trans gene signatures, we calculated the
connectivities to the drug instances in the Connectivity Map. The
connectivity score profiles of the 50 in trans gene sets showed
overall similar connectivities against each treatment instance,
suggesting the commonality of their connectivities to the drug
responses (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we used the averaged connectivity
score of the 50 in trans gene sets (S avg ) as a representing
connectivity to each treatment instance. We found only two
perturbagens, metformin and sirolimus (rapamycin), to be
significantly connected to the S avg (permutation P = 0.0025 and
0.0082, respectively; Fig. 4B). In addition, gefitinib, an epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
was also identified as having significant connectivity (S avg = 0.335
and ranked to 7th out of 453 instances). Because only one instance
for gefitinib was available in Connectivity Map (build01), we
performed permutation test by treating all the EGFR/IR selective
tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a same perturbagen (n = 7). This
revealed a strong connectivity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors to S avg (permutation P = 0.0022; Fig. 4B). These results
may suggest that the dysregulated potential driver genes can be
interrupted by rapamycin, metformin, or gefitinib treatment.
Interestingly, the cross-talk among the target molecules of
rapamycin, metformin, and gefitinib has been reported (i.e., mTOR,
AMPK, and EGFR; ref. 23). This supports the idea that a
combination of these drugs may provide clinical benefit for
patients with HCC (24). We found that the combined treatment
with these drugs could potentiate the growth inhibition of cancer
cells as compared with the expected potency calculated by Bliss
independence model ( for a review, see ref. 25; Fig. 4C).
In addition, our data suggests a novel link between the 50 genes
and the EGFR, AMPK, and mTOR signaling pathways. To verify this
notion, we examined the knockdown effects of NCSTN and SCRIB
on the mTOR signaling which is thought to be a common target for
the three signaling pathways. Western blot analysis showed that
the knockdown of NCSTN and SCRIB could indeed inhibit the
phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, one of mTOR’s targets (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
In this study, we conducted a combined analysis of copy
numbers and gene expression with the following unbiased
strategies. By applying regional pattern recognition approach, TM
and TCM, we could identify the most probable copy number–
dependent genes. In each step of our gene selection strategy, the
functional relevance of the selected genes was evaluated by
estimating the prognostic effect from the expression patterns and
clinical information. Although our study was not intended to
classify prognostic groups using the copy numbers or the gene
expression patterns, we adopted clustering algorithm and log rank
test to calculate PIS which allowed the evaluation of the functional
relevance of our gene selection strategy. Our analysis revealed 50
potential driver genes which have significant prognostic relevance.
Indeed, the 50 genes included many cancer-related genes. For
example, RRM2B, HAX1, CUTL1, HSF1, EPHB4, and MTDH were
known to regulate tumorigenesis, tumor migration, or adhesion.
The genes related to RNA processing/transcription (e.g., ADAR,

Potential Driver Genes in Human HCC

ELP3, HMBOX1, POLR2K, ZHX1, and KARS) and cell cycle
regulation (e.g., BRD4, CCNC, and CCNE1) were also identified.
The functional significance of the 50 genes was further evaluated
in part by siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Particularly,
NCSTN, encoding a g-secretase component, showed the most
potent effect on cancer cell growth in our screening. Supporting
our finding, NCSTN was previously identified as one of the copy
number–dependent genes in HCC (11). Moreover, inhibition of
g-secretase has been reported to reduce leukemia cell growth via
Notch and mTOR signaling pathways (26). SCRIB was also known
to associate with human cancers (27), but its oncogenic role is not
yet fully understood. Loss of HSF1 inhibited cancer cell growth

(Fig. 4) in agreement with the recent identification of HSF1 as an
oncogene (28). Taken together, our data successfully show the
potential driver roles of the 50 genes, and suggest that our strategy
can efficiently identify novel therapeutic targets.
The application of the in trans correlated genes to mine the
Connectivity Map allowed us to identify therapeutic targets for the
50 genes. In the past, the Connectivity Map has been used to
predict the therapeutic targets or diseases from gene expression
signatures (16, 29, 30). In contrast with these studies, we used
in trans correlated gene signatures to predict the molecular targets
which were functionally associated with each of the 50 genes. In
support of our approach, the coexpressed genes in microarray data

have been previously shown to be functionally related (31).
Accordingly, our in silico approach could predict relevant effector
targets without generating experimental signatures for each of the
driver genes. Identification of common connectivities (S avg) from
50 different signatures might also be helpful in reducing chance
findings which can be generated by applying a single signature.
Indeed, our approach was able not only to predict well-known
anticancer drugs with recognized therapeutic potential for HCC,
such as rapamycin and gefitinib (8, 32–36), but also identified
metformin as a therapeutic drug for targeting the 50 in trans gene
signatures. Metformin is a widely used hypoglycemic drug for
patients with diabetes. Recently, several studies have shown its
anticancer effect, suggesting a novel utility of the antimetabolic
drugs for cancer treatment (15, 37, 38). Supporting these studies,
we observed for the first time the therapeutic efficacy of metformin
for HCC using single or combination regimens for treating HCC
cell lines in vitro (Fig. 4C).
Our analysis also predicted novel links between the 50 genes and
mTOR, AMPK, and EGFR pathways. Supporting this notion, the
oncogenic function of HSF1 has been reported to be mediated by
mTOR (22) and EGFR (39) pathways. Likewise, we showed that the
knockdown effects of NCSTN and SCRIB are possibly mediated

through these pathways. Although further stringent validations for
the mechanism(s) might be required, our findings open new
opportunities for studying the multifaceted association of these 50
genes with the three identified pathways.
In conclusion, we suggest that our unbiased gene selection
strategy of integrating multidimensional genomic data can
effectively select the potential driver genes and provide new
biological and clinical insights into the copy number–dependent
genes in HCC. Undoubtedly, our strategy can be applied to other
cancer types.
