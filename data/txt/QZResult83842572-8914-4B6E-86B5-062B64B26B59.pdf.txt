BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) complete response (PSACR), measured at the end of external-beam radiotherapy and short-term hormone therapy, on treatment outcomes. METHODS: The
phase 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9413 trial, as part of its original protocol, used the assessment of PSA-CR (ie, PSA 0.3
ng/mL) at the end of short-term HT as a secondary endpoint. Short-term HT consisted of futamide plus a lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist for 4 months. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival. Cumulative incidence was used to estimate biochemical failure, distant metastasis, and disease-specific survival. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed to correlate PSA-CR after short-term hormone therapy with all endpoints, and the following
variables were considered for analysis: PSA at baseline, Gleason score, treatment arm, age, and baseline testosterone status. Phoenix
consensus definition was used to define PSA failure. RESULTS: For 1070 evaluable patients, the median PSA at the end of short-term
hormone therapy was 0.2 ng/mL. In total, 744 patients (70%) had a PSA-CR. At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, failure to obtain a
PSA-CR was associated significantly with worse disease-specific survival (P ¼ .0003; hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.38-2.97), with worse disease-free survival (P ¼ .003; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.50), and with a higher incidence of distant metastasis (P ¼ .0002; HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.37-2.69) and biochemical failure (P < .0001; HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29-1.91). Other factors that were associated with worse disease-specific survival were Gleason scores from 8 to 10 (P ¼ .0002; HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.71-5.47) and PSA levels
>20 ng/mL (P ¼ .04; HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.02-2.30). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that failure to obtain a PSA-CR (PSA
0.3 ng/mL) after short-term hormone therapy and external-beam radiotherapy appears to be an independent predictor of unfavorable outcomes and could help identify patients who may benefit from the addition of long-term androgen ablation. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with radiation therapy is frequently used in the treatment of
patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.1 ADT duration is usually predetermined based on tumor characteristics,
mainly Gleason score, baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and tumor (T) classification (according to the TNM
staging system); physicians’ experience; and also patient characteristics (age, comorbidities, life expectancy). Optimal
ADT duration is unknown, and patients are treated based on knowledge learned from clinical trials, most of which have
demonstrated that longer treatment duration for higher risk disease provides better treatment outcomes. ADT, however,
is not innocuous and is associated with side effects in both the short-term and the long-term.2 Therefore, the ideal balance
between oncologic need and normal physiologic tolerance must be evaluated on an individual basis.
PSA and its various constructs, such as PSA doubling time, free PSA, PSA density, PSA nadir, time to PSA nadir,
among others, are tools used for screening and post-treatment follow-up of prostate cancer, independent of the therapeutic
option chosen.3,4 However, most measurements of treatment efficacy are performed retrospectively and are based on

consecutive PSA measurements, not allowing for prospective interventions during treatment and, consequently,
treatment individualization.
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial
94135 was a phase 3 randomized controlled trial that
tested 2 different hypotheses in men with localized prostate cancer: 1) whether total androgen suppression
(TAS) plus whole pelvic radiation therapy (WPRT)
improves outcomes compared with TAS plus prostateonly radiation therapy (PORT), and 2) whether neoadjuvant and concurrent TAS plus radiation therapy
improves outcomes compared with adjuvant TAS plus
radiation therapy. The original study protocol6 had in
its design a planned assessment of ‘‘PSA complete
response’’ (PSA-CR), ie, PSA 0.3 ng/mL, at the discontinuation of hormone therapy (HT) to measure
treatment efficacy. For this specific purpose, the protocol required a blood test with serum PSA for all patients
at the completion of HT. This information was
acquired prospectively for patients enrolled in the trial.
The objective of the current study was to investigate the
correlation between a PSA level <0.3 ng/mL with treatment outcomes considered as the endpoints on the
RTOG 9413 study. The hypothesis of the analysis was
that patients who achieved a PSA-CR at the end of HT
would have better treatment outcomes than those with
a PSA nadir >0.3 ng/mL at the same time point.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The RTOG 9413 trial accrued men with histologically
confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate who had an
estimated risk of lymph node involvement >15% but
with negative lymph nodes and a PSA level
100 ng/mL. In total, 1279 patients were enrolled and
treated between April, 1995 and June, 1999 and were
randomized to 1 of 4 arms: PORT or WPRT followed
by a boost to the prostate only in combination with either neoadjuvant and concomitant HT (NCHT) or adjuvant HT. All patients were planned to receive a total
dose of 70.2 grays (Gy) in 39 fractions, with the difference that patients receiving WPRT were treated on 2
plans, first for the whole pelvis to 50.4 Gy and a second
to the prostate only reaching the total dose, whereas
patients receiving PORT were treated on a single plan
to the prostate and seminal vesicles. With regard to
HT, all patients received total androgen suppression
(TAS) for a total of 4 months, consisting of monthly
leuprolide acetate 7.5 mg intramuscularly or goserelin
acetate 3.6 mg subcutaneously and oral flutamide
250 mg 3 times daily. Patients receiving NCHT
2000

received their first lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist injection 2 months before radiotherapy
(RT) and continued HT for the duration of RT,
whereas those receiving adjuvant HT were started on
HT immediately after completion of RT.
Patients who were eligible for the current analysis
were on the RTOG 9413 protocol who had data available
on baseline testosterone, end of HT date, and PSA value
at the end of HT, defined as a PSA evaluation within 120
days after the completion of HT. Outcome parameters
assessed on this study were biochemical failure, local progression, distant metastasis, disease-free survival (DFS),
disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS).
The RTOG-American Society for Therapeutic Radiology
and Oncology (ASTRO) Phoenix consensus definition7
was used to characterize biochemical failure.
For the endpoints OS and DFS, the Kaplan-Meier
method8 was used to estimate yearly survival rates. For all
other endpoints (biochemical failure, local progression,
distant metastasis, and DSS), the cumulative incidence
approach was used to estimate yearly incidence rates,9 and
the Gray test10 was used to test for differences. Univariate
analysis was performed to correlate PSA-CR (PSA 0.3
ng/mL) after TAS with all endpoints, and the following
variables were considered for multivariate analysis: baseline PSA, Gleason score, treatment arm, age, and baseline
testosterone. The Cox proportional hazards regression
model11 was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS
In total, 1279 patients were enrolled in the RTOG 9413
protocol, and 1070 of those patients were eligible for the
current study. Reasons for exclusion included a combination of absence of baseline testosterone (n ¼ 82), no HT
end date (n ¼ 44), or no PSA data at the end of HT (n ¼
144). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. A
balance in pretreatment characteristics, including age,
baseline PSA, T-stage, Gleason score, and baseline testosterone, between the 4 treatment arms was noted after the
exclusion of 209 patients who were not eligible for the
current study. The median PSA at the end of HT for all
patients was 0.2 ng/mL (range, 0-96.2 ng/mL). In all, 744
patients (70%) reached a PSA-CR at the end of HT. The
time to reach PSA nadir was 3.7 months (range, 0.8-8.2
months). At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, higher rates
of biochemical failure (56% vs 38%), local progression
(15% vs 10%), and distant metastasis (20% vs 10%)
along with worse DFS (28% vs 40%), DSS (85% vs
93%), and OS (67% vs 69%) were observed in the 326
patients who failed to achieve a PSA-CR. Univariate

analysis revealed that the 7-year biochemical failure, DFS,
distant metastasis, and DSS rates were statistically significantly better for patients with end-of-HT PSA level
0.3 ng/mL; whereas the differences in local progression
and OS rates were not statistically significant between
those who did and did not achieve a PSA-CR (Table 2).
On multivariate analysis, as indicated in Table 3,
failure to reach a PSA-CR at the end of ADT was an independent predictor of biochemical failure, DFS, distant
metastasis, and DSS. Other factors that had a significant
and independent association with worse DSS were a baseline PSA level >20 ng/mL and a Gleason score from 8 to
10. The only factor associated with poorer OS was baseline a PSA level >20 ng/mL.
In a separate assessment of the 326 patients (30.4%)
who failed to reach a PSA-CR at the end of HT, we
observed that 169 patients presented with a PSA-CR at a
later time (‘‘late responders’’), whereas the remaining 157
patients never reached a PSA nadir <0.3 ng/mL (‘‘nonresCancer

ponders’’). The median time to reach PSA 0.3 ng/mL
for late complete responders was 7.2 months. When late
responders were compared with nonresponders, a significantly lower rate of distant metastasis (P ¼ .02) and better
DSS (P ¼ .002) and OS (P ¼ .0001) were observed in
patients who had a ‘‘late’’ PSA-CR. However, when late
responders were compared with the patients who achieved
a PSA-CR at the end of HT, early complete response conferred a significantly lower rate of biochemical failure rate
(P < .0001) and longer DFS (P ¼ .002).
In a post hoc analysis of all patients who reached a
PSA-CR with PSA 0.3 ng/dL, independent of time to
response, univariate analysis demonstrated that 7-year
biochemical failure, DFS, distant metastasis, DSS, and
OS rates were statistically significantly better for patients
who achieved an end-of-HT PSA level 0.3 ng/mL. During follow-up, in total, 357 patients died, including 104
deaths from prostate cancer. Among these, 55 patients
(53%) achieved a PSA-CR at the end of HT. Of the 253

worse OS and cause-specific survival. In 103 patients,
multivariate analysis revealed that PSA 1.0 ng/mL at the
end of HT (P < .0001), baseline PSA >20 ng/mL (P ¼
.02), and Gleason score 8 (P ¼ .0001) were associated
with worse DSS; whereas PSA 1.0 ng/mL at the end of

DISCUSSION
Phase 3 trials that included patients with intermediaterisk and high-risk prostate cancer who received externalbeam RT (EBRT) combined with ADT demonstrated
lower rates of distant metastasis with improved biochemical control, cause-specific survival, and OS.12-15 Although
the optimal duration of HT is constantly under investigation in clinical trials, ADT for 28 to 36 months is generally accepted as standard for patients with high-risk
prostate cancer.14,15 Given the significant morbidity with
2 or 3 years of ADT, it is of interest to determine whether
the same beneficial effect can be observed with shorter
courses of ADT and which patient population would benefit from this potential shortening, given that high-risk
prostate cancer is a broad group of cancers classed under
the same risk stratification that possibly may require different treatment approaches, such as HT duration.

PSA Response and Treatment Otcome/Cury et al

Many prognostic and predictive factors have been
evaluated for disease control and survival after initial therapy for prostate cancer, including initial PSA and Gleason
score,16 time to undetectable PSA,17 and PSA nadir at
specific time points18-20 among others, but none have
been tested by means of a clinical trial and translated into
clinical practice. Currently, in patients with prostate cancer, the duration of ADT is predetermined and is based
exclusively on baseline tumor characteristics instead of
individual response to therapy. There are no means to differentiate patients who require shorter duration ADT
from those who need longer periods of ADT or to identify
those who have a greater chance of dying from prostate
cancer and possibly may benefit from more aggressive
therapy.
In a Canadian multicenter randomized trial
designed to compare the effectiveness of 2 durations of
neoadjuvant ADT before EBRT, 353 patients with prostate cancer in any risk group were randomized to receive
3-month or 8-month ADT between 1995 and 2001.21 At
a median follow-up of 6.4 years, there was no significant
difference in biochemical failure, DSS, or OS between the
study groups. In a post hoc analysis,22 the authors suggested that biochemical response measured at the end of
ADT was more important than ADT duration before
EBRT comparing patients with PSA levels that reached
levels 0.1 ng/dL versus those who did not reach that
level. For the entire cohort, a biochemical response to
PSA levels 0.1 ng/dL was associated with a lower incidence of biochemical failure at 8 years; however, it failed
to predict DSS or OS in any of the analyses performed for
the entire cohort or subgroups; this is probably related to
the relative short follow-up of this lower risk prostate cancer population and the small number of cancer-related
deaths in this group. Another possible contributing factor
for the lack of predictive power is the threshold value (0.1
ng/dL) chosen for that post hoc analysis.
Recently D’Amico et al23 used the Prentice criteria
to demonstrate that PSA levels >0.5 ng/mL after 6
months of ADT and EBRT and a PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL
were surrogate endpoints for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Their study was performed in a group of patients
with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer from
2 different clinical trials: 1) the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, which randomized 206 patients to EBRT alone (70
Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions) or EBRT plus 6 months of
ADT (EBRT during months 3 and 4 of ADT); and 2) the
Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group Trial 96.01,
in which 818 patients were randomized between EBRT
alone (66 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions), EBRT plus 3 months
Cancer

of ADT, or EBRT plus 6 months of ADT (ADT starting
2 months before EBRT in both arms). However, the
group that received 3 months of ADT in the 96.01 trial
was not included in the analysis; and, in total, 734 patients
were assessed—371 patients who received EBRT alone
and 363 who received EBRT plus ADT—and were followed for a median of 8.2 years. That retrospective analysis produced results similar to ours in a mixed group of
patients with prostate cancer who had adequate follow-up
but included a smaller number of patients enrolled in 2
different trials and a higher PSA cutoff point.
In conclusion, the failure to obtain a PSA-CR with a
PSA level 0.3 ng/mL after short-term HT and EBRT
appears to be an independent predictor of an unfavorable
outcome. In an attempt to individualize therapy based on
specific tumor needs, this hypothesis-generating study
suggests that complete responders (ie, patients with a PSA
0.3 ng/dL after short-course ADT and EBRT) could
stop ADT earlier than the usually recommended 2 to 3
years. Such an important change in current practice must
be investigated on a clinical trial.
