Abstract
Activating mutations of BRAF occur in f7% of all human
tumors and in the majority of melanomas. These tumors
are very sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of mitogenactivated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
kinase (MEK), which causes loss of D-cyclin expression,
hypophosphorylation of Rb, and G1 arrest. Growth arrest is
followed by differentiation or senescence and, in a subset
of BRAF mutant tumors, by apoptosis. The former effects result
in so-called ‘‘stable disease’’ and, in patients with cancer, can
be difficult to distinguish from indolent tumor growth. The
profound G1 arrest induced by MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant
tumors is associated with a marked decline in thymidine
uptake and is therefore potentially detectable in vivo by
noninvasive 3¶-deoxy-3¶-[ 18 F]fluorothymidine ([ 18 F]FLT)
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In SKMEL-28
tumor xenografts, MEK inhibition completely inhibited tumor
growth and induced differentiation with only modest tumor
regression. MEK inhibition also resulted in a rapid decline in
the [18F]FLT signal in V600E BRAF mutant SKMEL-28 xenografts but not in BRAF wild-type BT-474 xenografts. The data
suggest that [18F]FLT PET can effectively image induction of G1
arrest by MEK inhibitors in mutant BRAF tumors and may be a
useful noninvasive method for assessing the early biological
response to this class of drugs. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11463–9]

Introduction
The demonstration that activating mutations in oncoproteins
are pathogenic in many human tumors has created hope that more
effective and less toxic cancer therapies can be developed that
work by inhibiting the specific molecular alterations responsible
for cancer initiation and progression. Although advances in
crystallography and chemistry have allowed for the generation of
libraries of highly selective kinase inhibitors, a major bottleneck in
the clinical testing of these drugs is the dearth of validated
biomarkers for use in early-stage clinical trials. The gold standard
in phase I clinical trials has been the collection of tumor tissue
before and after treatment to assess the magnitude of target
inhibition with the goal of identifying an optimal ‘‘biological dose’’
for testing in disease-specific clinical trials. This approach is often

limited in the most common solid tumors by the lack of tumor
tissue accessible for biopsy. Furthermore, even when biopsies are
feasible in diseases such as prostate, lung, and breast cancer,
typically only a limited amount of tissue is collected and at only
one posttreatment time point. For these reasons, the development
of noninvasive biomarkers of target inhibition could significantly
accelerate the development of novel cancer therapies.
3¶-deoxy-3¶-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT) is an imaging tracer
that is preferentially retained in proliferating cells (1). Thymidine
kinase 1 (TK1), which is expressed in S phase, catalyzes the
phosphorylation of [18F]FLT to [18F]FLT-monophosphate, which,
because of its negative charge, is trapped in cells (1–3). [18F]FLT
thus accumulates in proliferating tissues and its retention is
reduced in tumor cells that are growth arrested in G1. As the
biodistribution of [18F]FLT can be assayed using positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, changes in [18F]FLT uptake may serve
as a noninvasive biomarker of the antiproliferative activity of novel
cancer therapies.
We have previously reported that tumor cells with BRAF
mutations are selectively sensitive to inhibitors of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) kinase (4). This MEK dependency was
observed in BRAF mutant cells regardless of tissue lineage and
correlated with both down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and
the induction of a G1 arrest. As inhibition of the G1-S transition is
rapid and complete in BRAF mutant tumors, and does not occur
in resistant tumors, we hypothesized that [18F]FLT PET imaging
may represent an ideal noninvasive early marker of activity for this
class of agents. To test this approach, we compared [18F]FLT and
2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) uptake in xenograft
tumors treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. PD0325901 was obtained from Pfizer Global Research and
Development. For in vitro studies, drug was dissolved in DMSO to yield a
1 mmol/L stock solution and stored at 20jC. SKMEL-28 cells were obtained
from Alan Houghton and Paul Chapman (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, New York, NY) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
2 mmol/L glutamine, 50 units/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2.
BT-474 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and grown in DMEM:F12. For thymidine incorporation studies, thymidine (Moravek Biochemicals) was added to cells at a concentration of
0.1 ACi/mL. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) studies, both
adherent and floating cells were harvested at the indicated time points and
stained with ethidium bromide using the method of Nusse et al. (5).
Detection and quantification of apoptotic cells (sub-G1) was performed by

Synthesis of [18F]FLT. [18F]FLT was generated by the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center Cyclotron Core using a protected nosylate
precursor using the method of Yun et al. (6). Briefly, ‘‘no carrier-added’’
[18F]fluoride ion trapped on a QMA (Waters) cartridge was washed from the
cartridge using 420 AL of water and 80 AL of 0.25 mol/L K2CO3. The fluoride
solution was then transferred into a Reacti-Vial (5 mL) containing 15 mg
Kryptofix 2.2.2 and 0.5 mL CH3CN (Sigma-Aldrich). Water was removed by
azeotropic distillation with CH3CN (3  0.5 mL) at 105jC to 110jC. To the
anhydrous residue, a solution of 15 mg of (5¶-O-dimethoxytrityl-2¶-deoxy-3¶O-nosyl-h-D-threo-pentofuranosyl)-3-N-BOC-thymidine precursor (ABX Advanced Biochemical Compounds) in 0.3 mL anhydrous CH3CN was then
added. The mixture was heated for 4 min at 150jC and 8 min at 105jC.
After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was acidified with
0.5 mL of 1 N HCl and heated to 105jC for 5 min. The mixture was cooled to
room temperature, neutralized with 1 N NaOH, and allowed to pass through
an alumina Sep-Pak (Water). The Sep-Pak was then washed with 0.6 mL
water. The recovered 18F solution was then injected onto a C-18
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column
(250  22 mm, 10 A, 9.9 mL/min flow rate with mobile phase of 10% ethanol
in water; Alltech). [18F]FLT was fractionally collected, rendered isotonic

with sodium chloride, and terminally sterilized using a 0.22 A sterile filter
into a sterile vial. The radiochemical yield ranged from 20% to 25% (decay
corrected) and chemical and radiochemical purities of the product (99%
pure) were confirmed by analytic HPLC (Phenomenex C-18 column, 4.6 
250 mm, 10 A with mobile phase of 15% CH3CN in water). The synthesis
time was f80 min.
Animal studies. Four- to 6-week-old nu/nu athymic female mice were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Center and
maintained in ventilated caging. Experiments were carried out under an
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocol and
institutional guidelines for the proper and humane use of animals in
research were followed. Tumors were generated by injecting 0.5  107 to
1.0  107 tumor cells together with reconstituted basement membrane
(Matrigel, Collaborative Research). For the BT-474 model, 0.72 mg estradiol
pellets (Innovative Research of America) were inserted s.c. before tumor cell
inoculation. Before initiation of treatment, mice were randomized to receive
PD0325901 at a dose of 25 mg/kg or vehicle only as control. PD0325901 was
formulated in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose plus 0.2% Tween 80 and
given by p.o. gavage. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 euthanasia. The average
tumor diameter (two perpendicular axes of the tumor were measured) was

measured in control and treated groups using a caliper, and tumor volume
was calculated using the following formula: tumor volume in mm3 = p / 6 
larger diameter  (smaller diameter)2. To prepare lysates, tumor tissue was
homogenized in 2% SDS lysis buffer and then processed as described above.
For immunohistochemical studies, xenograft tumors were fixed overnight in
paraformaldehyde followed by dehydration in graded ethanols.
PET imaging. Tumor-bearing mice were imaged using an R4 microPET
scanner (Concorde Microsystems) following injection with [18F]FLT or
[18F]FDG. [18F]FLT and [18F]FDG imaging was performed on 2 consecutive
days every week. Before imaging, 13 to 15 MBq (350–400 ACi) of [18F]FLT (as
generated as above) or [18F]FDG (Eastern Isotopes) were injected into the
mice via tail vein. Imaging was performed 60 to 70 min following
radiotracer injection under 2% (at 1 L/min) isoflurane (Forane, Baxter
Healthcare) anesthesia. Image acquisition time was 5 min (at 250–750 keV
window) and reconstructed using filtered back projection without
attenuation correction. Visualization and region of interest (ROI) analyses
of microPET images were carried out using AsiPRO (Concorde Microsystems) software with values adjusted according to in-house phantom
studies. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were generated by drawing ROIs
around the tumor and calculated (with decay correction) according to the

Results
MEK inhibition causes G1 arrest and inhibits thymidine
uptake in BRAF (V600E) mutant cells. To characterize the
consequences of MEK inhibition in cancer cells with mutant and
wild-type (WT) BRAF, we determined the effect of MEK inhibition
on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in MEK inhibitorsensitive and inhibitor-resistant models. To inhibit MEK in these
studies, we used PD0325901, an allosteric inhibitor of MEK that
inhibits MEK kinase activity by locking the enzyme in a closed but
catalytically inactive conformation (7–9). Consistent with our prior
results, PD0325901 treatment of SKMEL-28 (V600E BRAF, melanoma), SKMEL-19 (V600E BRAF, melanoma), and Colo205 (V600E
BRAF, colon) cells resulted in growth inhibition with IC50 values
ranging from 1 to 5 nmol/L (Fig. 1A and B). Cell cycle analysis by
FACS of SKMEL-28 cells treated with PD0325901 showed
accumulation of cells in G1 with no induction of apoptosis as
measured by FACS (Fig. 1C and D) or by poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase cleavage or caspase-3 activation as measured by
immunoblot (data not shown; see ref. 4). In SKMEL-28 cells
treated with PD0325901, G1 arrest was accompanied by a decline in
thymidine uptake and an increase in the percentage of cells
staining positive for SA-h-Gal, a hallmark of senescent cells (Fig. 2;
ref. 10). Despite the increase in SA-h-Gal staining and evidence of
morphologic differentiation by light microscopy, washout of drug
after 48 h resulted in a rebound in thymidine uptake (Fig. 2B).
In contrast to the antiproliferative effects of PD0325901 in BRAF
mutant cell lines, cancer cell lines with mutant and amplified
epidermal growth factor receptor or HER2, including BT-474 (HER2amplified breast) cells, were resistant to the antiproliferative effects
of PD0325901 despite their high levels of basal ERK activity (Fig. 1).
Consistent with this finding, treatment of BT-474 cells with
PD0325901 resulted in no change in cell cycle distribution and
minimal change (<25% decline) in thymidine uptake (Figs. 1 and 2).
These data suggested that changes in thymidine uptake may be a

useful predictive marker of MEK sensitivity in cancer cells with
activated MAPK signaling.
Changes in [18F]FLT and [18F]FDG uptake in PD0325901sensitive and PD0325901-resistant xenograft tumors. To assess
the value of thymidine uptake as a predictive marker of MEK
inhibitor sensitivity, mice with established SKMEL-28 (BRAF V600E
mutant) xenografts were treated by p.o. gavage with PD0325901
(25 mg/kg five times weekly) or vehicle only as control for up to
8 weeks. MEK inhibition resulted in down-regulation of MAPK
activity (as measured by a decline in phosphorylated ERK expression), down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, and increased
expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and Rb
hypophosphorylation (Fig. 3). This resulted in a profound decrease
in tumor cell proliferation as measured by a decline in the percentage of cells staining positive for Ki-67 and an increase in the
expression of the melanocyte differentiation marker tyrosinase. As
was observed in cell culture, apoptosis was not observed in
PD0325901-treated SKMEL-28 xenografts at either early (1 or
2 week) or late time points (4 and 8 weeks). Although modest tumor
regression was observed (mean regression of 46% after
3 weeks of treatment), the size of most tumors stabilized after
several weeks of treatment. Furthermore, even after 8 weeks of
treatment, tumor growth did resume in four of five mice following
discontinuation of PD0325901 treatment (Fig. 3). Only one complete
response was observed despite prolonged treatment (8 weeks).
As PD0325901 induced a potent cytostatic effect in SKMEL-28
cells, we sought to determine the utility of [18F]FLT PET imaging as
a biomarker of response to this agent. Mice with established
tumors were randomized to treatment for 3 weeks with PD0325901
or the vehicle only as control. [18F]FLT PET and [18F]FDG PET
imaging was performed weekly. One week of treatment with
PD0325901 resulted in a mean 43% decline in [18F]FLT uptake in
the tumor as estimated by PET imaging. In contrast, a mean 32%
increase in tumor [18F]FLT uptake occurred in mice treated with
the vehicle alone (Figs. 4 and 5). Following this initial decline in
uptake during week 1 of treatment, [18F]FLT uptake in the tumors
of PD0325901-treated, SKMEL-28–bearing mice remained stable on
repeat imaging during weeks 2 and 3 (Fig. 5). In contrast, [18F]FLT

uptake continued to increase in the vehicle-treated mice in parallel
with the increase in tumor size in these mice.
As compared with [18F]FLT, the decrease in [18F]FDG uptake in
PD0325901-treated, SKMEL-28–bearing mice was more gradual
and less pronounced (Figs. 4 and 5). After 1 week, a mean decline in
[18F]FDG uptake of 16% was observed compared with a 43%
decline in [18F]FLT uptake. With continued drug treatment, which
resulted in modest tumor regression as above, the [18F]FDG uptake
in PD0325901-treated, SKMEL-28–bearing mice declined to 29% of
the pretreatment mean (week 3). This compared with a 149%
increase in [18F]FDG uptake in the vehicle-treated mice at 3 weeks.
[18F]FLT and [18F]FDG imaging was also performed in mice with
established BT-474 xenografts, which are resistant to PD0325901. In
these mice, PD0325901 treatment resulted in no change in [18F]FLT
or [18F]FDG uptake despite effective inhibition of phosphorylated
ERK in the PD0325901-treated tumors (Fig. 5D). These data suggest
that [18F]FLT PET may have utility as a biomarker of MEK
inhibitor-induced cell cycle arrest.

Discussion
Prolongation of survival, disease cure, and palliation of
symptoms are all goals of systemic anticancer agents. As current
systemic therapies rarely cause complete disease eradication in
patients with solid tumors, the primary end point of most phase III
randomized chemotherapy trials is prolongation of survival. In
contrast, in the majority of early-stage clinical studies, response
rates are used as the primary therapeutic end point based on the
assumption that agents that induce tumor regression are those
most likely to show a survival benefit in future randomized studies.
In these trials, response is typically defined as a reduction in tumor
size as determined by noninvasive computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging.
Reliance on quantitative imaging techniques to identify potentially useful anticancer agents has several disadvantages. Changes in
tumor size in response to agents that inhibit tumor growth often
take several weeks or months to become apparent. As a
consequence, patients are often continued on ineffective treatments

for months before quantitative imaging can establish that a
particular treatment has failed. Second, many agents, particularly
those targeting pathways responsible for cell proliferation, do not
induce tumor cell death and therefore would not be expected
to induce significant tumor regression. These agents, however,
may induce cell cycle arrest or senescence and therefore may
prolong survival by delaying disease progression. Recent trials with
erlotinib in lung cancer and imatinib and sunitinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors suggest that disease stability and not tumor
regression may account for much if not most of the survival benefit
associated with the use of these agents (11–15). Finally, it is difficult
for clinical investigators to distinguish indolent tumor growth that is
resistant to a study drug from the stabilized growth of tumors that
have responded in a cytostatic manner to the agent. Therefore, in
early-stage clinical trials of drugs such as the MEK inhibitor, stable
disease is a category that may include both patients who have
responded to the drug with disease stabilization and those with
resistant tumors that have an indolent natural history.
In the current study, we show that PD0325901, a selective,
allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 kinases, induces growth
arrest, differentiation, and senescence of cancer cells with V600E
BRAF mutation. Mutations in the kinase domain of BRAF have
been identified in f7% of all human cancers, most often in
melanoma, papillary thyroid, and colon cancers (16–20). The V600E
mutation is by far the most commonly observed BRAF mutation in
human tumors, accounting for >80% of cases (16, 21). In tumors
with this mutation, cyclin D1 expression and G1 progression are
under the control of MEK/ERK and inhibition of MEK causes a
rapid down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, induction of p27,
hypophosphorylation of Rb, and G1 cell cycle arrest (4). Within the
class of cell lines harboring V600E BRAF mutations, apoptosis in
response to MEK inhibition is variable with some cell lines,
including the SKMEL-28 line, showing little if any apoptosis
following MEK inhibition (4). Consistent with this observation,
complete tumor responses are rare in mice bearing SKMEL-28
xenografts treated with PD0325901. Rather, PD0325901 treatment
of SKMEL-28–bearing mice induces modest tumor regression
followed by disease stabilization. In this model, resistance to

therapy was not observed even after 8 weeks of treatment.
However, tumors remained viable and tumor growth resumed
following discontinuation of therapy.
Analysis of tumor tissue from SKMEL-28 xenograft-bearing
mice treated with PD0325901 showed little evidence of apoptosis
at both early and late time points. However, a significant
reduction in tumor cell proliferation was apparent at 1 week in
the MEK inhibitor-treated mice. As inhibition of cell proliferation
seemed to be the primary response of these tumors to MEK
inhibition, we sought to determine whether [18F]FLT PET could
be used as an early predictive marker of response to MEK
inhibition. The utility of [18F]FLT PET as a marker of proliferation
is based on the finding that the expression and thus activity of
TK1 is regulated in a cell cycle–specific manner (1). Specifically,
TK1 is expressed primarily in S phase and is thus highly
expressed in proliferating cells but is expressed at low levels in
quiescent cells. TK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of [18F]FLT to
[18F]FLT-monophosphate, which, because of its negative charge, is
trapped in cells (2, 3). Therefore, agents such as the MEK
inhibitor PD0325901 that selectively arrest tumor cells in G1
would be predicted to cause a decrease in tumor [18F]FLT uptake
and tracer retention.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that treatment of
mice with established SKMEL-28 (V600E BRAF) tumors with the
MEK inhibitor was associated with an early FLT response, which
was maintained throughout the course of drug treatment. In
contrast, the change in [18F]FDG uptake in response to MEK
inhibition was modest and delayed in this model. Furthermore, no
change in [18F]FLT or [18F]FDG uptake was observed in response to
PD0325901 treatment in BT-474 xenografts, a PD0325901-resistant
model. These data suggest that FLT may have advantages over
[18F]FDG as an early predictor of response to MEK inhibition in
cancer patients whose tumors are driven by mutant BRAF.
In summary, the data support the use of [18F]FLT PET as a
method for imaging the biological consequence of MEK inhibition
in vivo. The incorporation of [18F]FLT imaging into early-stage
clinical trials of MEK pathway inhibitors should thus accelerate
the development of such compounds by aiding in the identification of their optimal biological dose. The use of [18F]FLT PET
imaging will also allow for a better assessment of the clinical
utility of this class of agents in phase I and II clinical trials by
helping to distinguish patients who have responded to MEK
inhibition with disease stabilization from those with indolent or
partially responsive disease.
