BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to determine the survival benefit of postoperative chemoradiation therapy
for elderly patients with resected gastric adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The authors identified 1023 individuals aged
65 years and older (median ¼ 76) who underwent gastrectomy for nonmetastatic stage IB-IV gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2002 in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. They examined factors associated with receiving postoperative chemoradiation and analyzed the survival
benefit associated with receiving postoperative chemoradiation. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients received adjuvant chemoradiation. On multivariate analysis, younger age (P < .0001), lymph node involvement (P < .0001), and
more recent diagnosis (P ¼ .0284) were associated with receiving chemoradiation. There was a trend toward
increased use among patients with less comorbidity (P ¼ .0515). The median follow-up was 25.5 months, and 62%
died. On multivariate survival analysis, older patients (P < .0001) and those with lymph node involvement (P <
.0001), T3 or T4 disease (P ¼ .0472), higher grade disease (P ¼ .0355), and more comorbidity (P ¼ .0411) were more
likely to die. After adjustment for other factors, receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy did not significantly
increase survival (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.12; P ¼ .3453) and did not increase survival in a
multivariate analysis that included propensity scores (P ¼ .2090). CONCLUSIONS: The authors did not detect a survival benefit, suggesting that some elderly patients with resected gastric adenocarcinoma may not gain a survival
benefit from the administration of adjuvant chemoradiation. The analysis had limitations, and the results are hypothesis generating. Future gastric cancer trials should enroll more elderly patients and stratify patients by age to better

In a landmark trial, Intergroup (INT)-0116, postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved survival for
patients with resected gastric adenocarcimona.1 However, the effectiveness of postoperative chemoradiation for elderly
individuals treated outside of a controlled clinical trial setting is not known. It is important to understand the potential
benefit for older patients, because gastric cancer mostly affects older individuals; the average age at diagnosis is 71 years,
and almost 2=3 of those diagnosed with gastric cancer are older than 65 years.2
Older patients diagnosed with cancer are less likely to receive standard treatment compared with younger patients,
even when such treatments are potentially curative.3-5 Indeed, older patients with gastric cancer are less likely to receive

any type of treatment for their cancer compared with
younger patients,6 and older patients who undergo gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma are less likely to
receive postoperative radiation therapy.7
The determination of treatment effectiveness in the
elderly may substantially impact postoperative chemoradiation utilization among elderly patients with locally
advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Therefore, this study
used the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare database to examine clinical
and sociodemographic factors associated with receiving
postoperative chemoradiation for resected gastric adenocarcinoma among individuals aged 65 years and older and
to evaluate the survival benefit associated with receiving
postoperative chemoradiation. We hypothesized that
postoperative chemoradiation would confer a survival
benefit, but this survival benefit would be less than the
benefit demonstrated in the INT-0116 trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Patients were identified from the linked SEER-Medicare
database. The catchments for the 17 SEER tumor registries comprise 25% of the US population,8 and the registries participating in the SEER program capture
approximately 97% of incident cancers.9 The registries
collect data on patient demographics, primary tumor site,
tumor morphology and stage at diagnosis, first course of
treatment, and date and cause of death. The linked Medicare data include inpatient and outpatient medical claims
and physician billings,8 and were used to determine radiation and chemotherapy treatment, comorbid illnesses,
and treatment for metastatic disease. The SEER-Medicare
database used for this analysis contained SEER diagnoses
through 2002, Medicare claims through 2005, gastric
cancer-specific mortality through 2003, and vital status
follow-up through February 2005.
Cohort Selection
The cohort contained individuals aged 65 years and older
diagnosed with nonmetastatic invasive American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, sixth edition) stage IB to IV gastric adenocarcinoma in a SEER region between January 1,
2000 and December 31, 2002 and who underwent gastrectomy as initial therapy. We selected this date range because
the results of the INT-0116 trial were disseminated in
2000,10 and the results of the next landmark gastric cancer
trial, the MAGIC trial, were initially presented in early

2003.11 Individuals within our study cohort met basic criteria for enrollment in the INT-0116 trial (resected tumor
[T]2 to T4 disease or lymph node involvement).1 We
excluded subjects who died within 1 month of gastrectomy,
subjects with a prior cancer diagnosis because prior treatment
can impact adjuvant therapy recommendations, and subjects
who developed metastatic disease within 6 months of gastrectomy. Subjects who did not have continuous Medicare
enrollment (both Part A and Part B) and those who were enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO) any
time from 13 months before diagnosis (for use in comorbidity assessment) through 6 months after gastrectomy were
excluded because they did not have complete claims data. In
total, 1023 subjects met our inclusion criteria.
Variables and Their Measurement
The primary outcomes were receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation within 6 months postgastrectomy and overall survival. Medicare claims identified adjuvant chemotherapy
administration and have previously been shown to correlate well with chemotherapy receipt.12 Medicare claims
used to capture gastrectomy, general chemotherapy
administration, and general radiation therapy administration are detailed in Table 1. Both SEER and Medicare
were used to identify radiation therapy receipt within 6
months after the first gastrectomy claim to ensure a comprehensive assessment of radiation treatment.13 In the
SEER database, patients are coded as receiving radiation
therapy or recommendation for radiation therapy as a
component of the first course of treatment.
Explanatory variables evaluated for association with
receiving adjuvant chemoradiation therapy and with survival
included: diagnosis year, tumor characteristics (size, number
of lymph nodes involved), clinical characteristics (age at diagnosis, comorbidities), sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region of the country), type of
treating institution (academic vs community hospital), and
distance to nearest radiation treatment facility. Diagnosis
year was categorized into 6-month blocks. Tumor stage was
categorized by AJCC sixth edition T stage, which is based
on the depth of penetration (T1, T2, T3, and T4). The
number of involved regional lymph nodes were grouped
according to AJCC sixth edition regional lymph node (N)
staging as none (N0), 1 to 6 (N1), 7 to 15 (N2), and more
than 15 nodes (N3). We identified comorbidities by collecting diagnostic billing codes for specific health conditions
during the year before diagnosis of gastric cancer using the
Deyo implementation of the Charlson score applied to
both inpatient and outpatient claims.14-16 Subjects were

categorized as receiving their gastrectomy in a teaching hospital if there was a bill for indirect medical education during
their stay. Distance to the nearest radiation treatment facility
was determined by an established algorithm that calculated
the distance from the Zip Code of the patient’s residence to
that of the closest radiation therapy facility.17
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were generated for the study cohort.
The study subjects were stratified by adjuvant treatment
received: 1) no adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy; 2) either radiation therapy or chemotherapy; and 3)
both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Chi-square tests
and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare categorical
and continuous variables across treatment groups, respectively. The crude association of each potential explanatory
variable with the outcome of receiving chemoradiation
therapy was examined using univariate logistic regression.
The independent association of an explanatory variable was
examined using a multivariate logistic regression model

constructed using forward and backward elimination. Subjects with missing data for T stage (n ¼ 10), N stage (n ¼
74), grade (n ¼ 17), or distance from radiation facility (n
¼ 1) were excluded from univariate and multivariate models including these variables. The survival of the subjects
who received both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation
therapy was compared with the survival of the subjects
who received no adjuvant therapy. Individuals who
received either only chemotherapy or only radiation were
removed from the survival analysis (n ¼ 131). Survival, calculated from date of gastrectomy, was examined using multivariate and propensity-based Cox-proportional hazard
regression models that included all explanatory variables.
Propensity scores were created to account for unmeasured
factors associated with receiving chemoradiation that may
also influence overall survival. A multivariate logistic regression model with receipt of chemoradiation as the outcome
was used to generate the propensity scores. Subjects were
stratified into quintiles based on their scores, which were
then added as covariates to the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. In an exploratory analysis, survival
outcome among those with stage III or IV disease was
examined using a Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis. Interaction terms to test a priori hypotheses regarding
the receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (chemoradiation therapy and age, and chemoradiation therapy and
nodal involvement) were studied. For illustrative purposes,
unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed
comparing patients who received adjuvant combined chemoradiation therapy to those who received neither adjuvant chemotherapy nor adjuvant radiation therapy (Fig. 1).

In a sensitivity analysis, gastric-cancer specific survival
rather than overall survival was examined using multivariate and propensity-based Cox-proportional hazard regression models.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software,
version 9.1.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
This study was reviewed by the institutional review
board at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and determined to be exempt.

RESULTS
Descriptive Characteristics of the Study
Cohort
Among the 1023 elderly patients with nonmetastatic
resected stage IB to IV gastric adenocarcinoma, 5 % had
T1, 65% had T2, and 30% had T3 or T4 disease. Sixtynine percent of the patients had lymph node involvement
(Table 2). The median diagnosis age was 76 years (interquartile range, 72-81), and the majority of patients were
white (72%) or Asian (17%). Adjuvant chemoradiation
was administered to 30% (n ¼ 309) of subjects during the
study period, 57% (n ¼ 583) of subjects received no adjuvant therapy, and the remainder (n ¼ 131) received either
adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation therapy.
Thirty-two percent of subjects diagnosed between July
and December 2002 received adjuvant chemoradiation
therapy, compared with 21% of subjects diagnosed
between January and June 2000.
Predictors of Receiving Adjuvant Radiation
Therapy and Chemotherapy
On univariate analysis (Table 3), male sex (P ¼ .0165),
younger age (P < .0001), lymph node involvement (P <
.0001), less comorbidity (P ¼ .0019), higher socioeconomic status (P ¼ .0097), and more recent diagnosis (P ¼
.0161) were associated with increased receipt of adjuvant
chemoradiation after gastrectomy (Table 3). Distance to
radiation therapy facility was not associated with receiving
chemoradiation (P ¼ .1032).
On multivariate analysis, younger age (P < .0001),
lymph node involvement (P < .0001), and more recent
diagnosis (P ¼ .0284) were associated with chemoradiation after gastrectomy (Table 4). There was a trend toward
the use of chemoradiation among patients with less
comorbidity (P ¼ .0515).
Predictors of Survival
The survival of the subjects who received both adjuvant
chemotherapy and radiation therapy was compared with

Cancer

the survival of the subjects who received no adjuvant therapy. In total, 62% (554 of 892) of these subjects died during the follow-up period. The median follow-up was 25.5
months after gastrectomy (range, 4-62). On Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis, older patients (P <
.0001) and patients with lymph node involvement (P <
.0001), T3 or T4 disease (P ¼ .0472), higher grade disease
(P ¼ .0355), and comorbidity (P ¼ .0411) were more
likely to die (Table 5). In addition, Asian patients were
less likely to die than white patients (hazard ratio [HR],
0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.97; P ¼
.0327). After adjustment for other factors, receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy did not significantly increase
survival among this elderly population (HR, 0.90; 95%
CI, 0.72-1.12; P ¼ .3453). The median survival among
individuals who received chemoradiation therapy was
25.4 months versus 25.5 months for those who did not.
Receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy also did not
significantly increase survival in a multivariate analysis
that included propensity scores (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.691.09; P ¼ .2090), or in an analysis limited to patients
with stage III or IV disease (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.701.38; P ¼ .9115). A sensitivity analysis evaluating gastric
cancer survival rather than overall survival determined
that adjuvant chemoradiation therapy was not associated
with improved gastric cancer survival (P ¼ .665).
No significant interaction between age and receipt
of adjuvant chemoradiation (P ¼ .4903) or between nodal
involvement and receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation (P ¼
.2724) was noted on survival analysis.

DISCUSSION
Although a landmark trial demonstrated that postoperative chemoradiation improved survival for patients with
locally advanced resected gastric adenocarcimona,1 our
population-based analysis of 1023 patients aged 65 years
and older with resected gastric adenocarcinoma found no
significant survival benefit from postoperative chemoradiation therapy.
In our study, elderly patients most likely to clinically
benefit from adjuvant therapy—those with fewer
comorbidities, those with more advanced disease, and the
younger elderly—more likely to receive adjuvant
chemoradiation. Similar treatment patterns have been
demonstrated in elderly patients undergoing cancer treatment for prostate, breast, colon, and ovarian cancer.18-21
Patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma during
the later months of the study period were more likely to

receive adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, reflecting the
dissemination of trial results and adoption of adjuvant
chemoradiation into clinical practice. An initial report of
the INT-0116 trial was presented in May 2000,10 and the
findings were published in September 2001.1 Prior studies, using receipt of radiation therapy as a proxy for receipt
of both radiation therapy and chemotherapy, demonstrated an increase in adjuvant radiation therapy administration among patients of all ages after the May 2000
presentation of study results.7,22 We postulated that
patients undergoing gastrectomy at teaching institutions
would be more likely to receive adjuvant therapy, potentially reflecting early adoption of the study results at teaching institutions, and that patients living closer to radiation
therapy facilities would be more likely to receive adjuvant
therapy, because daily travel for radiation treatments
would be easier for them. However, neither surgery at a
teaching institution nor living closer to a radiation therapy
facility were associated with receiving adjuvant therapy.
Studies of patients diagnosed with other types of
cancer have demonstrated that older patients are less likely
to receive standard cancer treatment than younger
patients, even when such treatments are potentially curative.3-5 During our study period, adjuvant chemoradiation was administered to <1=3 of the patients. Cancer
stage at diagnosis and the perception of the elderly as frail
are potential explanations for why such a small proportion
of the patients in our study received adjuvant chemoradiation. More than half of the patients in our study had a
Charlson comorbidity score of zero, because patients
must be healthy to tolerate a gastrectomy. However, if

about possible treatment toxicity in this elderly population, as the acute toxicity of adjuvant chemoradiation
reported in the INT-0116 trial was considerable. Fiftyfour percent of patients experienced grade 3 or worse
National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC) hematological toxicity, and 1=3 of patients
experienced grade 3 or worse NCI-CTC gastrointestinal
toxicity.1 Early cancer stage at diagnosis is another potential explanation for why such a small proportion of the
elderly patients in our study received adjuvant chemoradiation. Patients in our study had earlier stage disease than
the patients in INT-0116; 71% had T1 or T2, and 32%
had N0 compared with only 32% with T1 or T2 and
15% with N0 disease in INT-0116. The applicability of
the INT-0116 results to patients with early stage disease
has been questioned because of the small number of study
patients with early stage disease and because of the relatively good prognosis among those with early stage disease.6,23 The smaller percentage of patients with early
stage disease (T1, T2, or N0) enrolled in the INT-0116
trial compared with our population-based cohort suggests
that only a small proportion of such patients were considered for enrollment in INT-0116. This enrollment bias
may reflect a preconceived belief that adjuvant therapy is
not necessary for early stage patients. Alternatively, the
stage distribution in our study may reflect a tendency to
forgo surgery in older patients with locally advanced
disease.
In our population-based multivariate analysis that
adjusted for clinical and demographic differences between
treatment groups, the addition of postoperative chemoradiation did not improve survival for elderly patients with
resected gastric adenocarcinoma. The median survival was
25.4 months among those who received adjuvant chemoradiation and 25.5 months among those who did not
receive combined adjuvant chemoradiation. This is in
stark contrast to the 9-month survival benefit, from 26 to
35 months, seen with the addition of chemoradiotherapy
in the INT-0116 trial.1,24 The median follow-up in our
study was not as long as the follow-up in INT-0116, but
it was well beyond the time when the survival curves in
INT-0116 diverged. Prior institutional series and population-based studies that suggested improved survival with
the addition of adjuvant chemoradiation studied younger
patients,25,26 did not have information on medical
comorbidities that can influence the likelihood of receiving adjuvant chemoradiation and truncate survival,25-27
and/or did not have information on chemotherapy
administration.27

There are several potential explanations for why our
study did not find a survival benefit. First, inadequate
radiation therapy may have been administered to patients
in our population-based cohort. The radiation field
design and treatment planning for gastric cancer is technically challenging. Upon central review of treatment plans
in the INT-0116 study, 34% of the radiation treatment
plans required a change before radiation administration.
If these plans were not changed, 2=3 of the deviations
would have resulted in undertreatment of patients,
whereas 1=3 had the potential to deliver extremely toxic
radiation.28 If radiation treatment caused serious toxicity
that aborted treatment before completion or if the radiation treatment target was missed, the patients would not
benefit from radiation therapy. We did not have information regarding radiation treatment plans, radiation treatment dose, or whether chemotherapy and radiation
therapy courses were completed after initiation of therapy.
A consensus statement on appropriate radiation treatment
fields was released in 2002, but was not available during
the first half of our study period.29 Second, as mentioned
previously, the patients in our study had earlier stage disease than INT-0116 patients and may not have benefited
from chemoradiation because of the relatively good prognosis among those with early disease. Third, margin status
may have impacted survival outcomes. Enrollment in
INT-0116 required complete resection with negative
margins, but margin status is not available in SEER-Medicare. However, data suggest that the impact of surgical
margin involvement on survival among patients with
resected gastric adenocarcinoma who receive adjuvant
chemoradiation therapy is minimal.25,30 The median survival of patients who received no adjuvant treatment in
our study was similar to the median survival of patients in
the observation arm of INT-0116. Moreover, although
margin status cannot be examined in our dataset, our
results reflect treatment patterns in the United States.
Finally, the demographics of our population-based cohort
were different from the INT-0116 trial (median age, 60
years); our cohort was older (median age, 76 years) and
included a higher proportion of individuals who were
Asian. We may not have found a survival benefit in our
study because of competing causes of mortality in these elderly patients.
This study has additional limitations common to
observational studies using administrative data. The data
source only captures Medicare patients and has incomplete data on the roughly 15% of patients in managed
care. Previous studies suggest that HMO patients tend to

255

Original Article

have fewer comorbidities than patients in the general
Medicare population31 and that practice patterns in
HMOs can differ significantly from those in a fee-forservice setting.32 However, other studies have found few
significant differences in cancer diagnosis and treatment
between managed care and fee-for-service patients.33
Methods for comorbidity adjustment are still undergoing
development and revision.16 Although the SEER-Medicare database is large, gastric cancer is a relatively rare cancer, and only 30% of patients received adjuvant
chemoradiation therapy; thus, our ability to detect significant associations was limited by the size of our study
cohort.
We did not detect a survival benefit from the administration of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in our population-based study. These results suggest that some elderly
patients with resected gastric adenocarcinoma may not
gain a survival benefit from adjuvant chemoradiation.
These findings should be considered hypothesis generating, and further investigation is necessary. Randomized
trials should enroll more elderly patients with gastric cancer and should stratify patients by age to permit subgroup
analysis of the elderly to better understand the impact of
treatment regimens on older patients.
