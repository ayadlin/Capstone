Abstract
Near Infrared-Photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a new, highly selective tumor
treatment that employs an antibody-photon absorber conjugate (APC). When the
APC attaches to its target cell and is exposed to NIR light, highly selective cell killing
is observed. NIR-PIT has been demonstrated with a limited number of antibodies.
Mesothelin is overexpressed in several malignancies and is emerging as a therapeutic
target. A recently humanized antibody (hYP218) has been generated against
mesothelin that demonstrates high affinity binding. Here, we describe the efficacy
of NIR-PIT, using hYP218 as the antibody within the APC to target a mesothelin
expressing A431/H9 cell. The hYP218 antibody was conjugated to a photo-absorber,
IR700 and incubated with the cells. The hYP218-IR700 showed specific binding to
cells and cell-specific killing was observed in vitro. After implanting A431/H9 cells in
an athymic nude mouse, tumor-bearing mice were treated with the following regimen
of NIR-PIT; 100 µg of hYP218-IR700 i.v., NIR light was administered at 50 J/cm2
on day 1 after injection and 100 J/cm2 of light on day 2 after injection. The hYP218IR700 showed high tumor accumulation and a high tumor-background ratio (TBR).
Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by NIR-PIT treatment compared with the
other control groups (p < 0.001), and significantly prolonged survival (p < 0.0001
vs other groups). Thus, the new anti-mesothelin antibody, hYP218, is suitable as an
antibody-drug conjugate for NIR-PIT. Furthermore, NIR-PIT with hYP218-IR700 is
a promising candidate for the treatment of mesothelin-expressing tumors that could
be readily translated to humans.

Introduction

a chimeric anti-mesothelin mAb, have been developed
and evaluated in clinical studies [11, 12]. SS1P and
MORAb-009 recognize an epitope within the N-terminal
Region I (residues 296–390) of cell surface mesothelin [13].
Unfortunately, Region I also interacts with MUC16 (also
known as CA125) which may interfere with the binding
and function of the antibody. This may compromise the
efficacy of these antibodies. Recently, a humanized nonRegion I antibody (hYP218) with high binding affinity
for the C-terminus (residues 487–581) of mesothelin has
been reported. There have been encouraging reports on its
mesothelin-specific cytotoxicity [14].
Near infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a
newly developed cancer treatment that employs a targeted

Mesothelin is a cell surface glycoprotein and
tumor differentiation antigen expressed in several
aggressive tumors namely, mesothelioma [1], pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [2–4], ovarian cancer [4, 5] and lung
adenocarcinoma [4, 6]. Mesothelin can be used as a
systemic diagnostic biomarker because it is shed from the
cell surface in biofluids such as serum, plasma, and pleural
effusions [7–9]. Additionally, its identification as a cancer
cell antigen has helped mesothelin emerge as a target for
antibody-based therapies [10]. A number of anti-mesothelin
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) including SS1P, antimesothelin immunotoxin, and MORAb-009 (amatuximab),

monoclonal antibody-photon absorber conjugate (APC)
[15]. The photon absorber, IRDye700DX (IR700, silicaphthalocyanine dye), is a highly hydrophilic dye which
sets it apart from the hydrophobic dyes normally used in
photodynamic therapy (PDT). NIR-PIT has been shown to
be effective with a variety of different antibodies, but has
not been tested with anti-mesothelin antibodies [16–20].
In this study, we investigated hYP218-IR700 as
a candidate APC to be used in NIR-PIT. The mesothelin
expressing A431/H9 cell line was used to study in vitro
tumor binding, in vivo tumor accumulation and intratumoral
distribution. NIR-PIT was performed using hYP218-IR700
in vitro and in a tumor-bearing mouse model in vivo.

fluorescence signal of background including liver decreased
beginning 6 hours after APC injection. Thus, we used one
day after APC injection to get the maximal difference
between tumor and background normal tissue.

In vivo NIR-PIT
The treatment and imaging regimen is shown in
Figure 3A. One day after injection of hYP218-IR700,
tumors showed higher fluorescence intensity than the
tumors with no APC. After exposure to 50 J/cm2 of NIR
light, IR700 fluorescence signal decreased due to dying cells
and partial photo-bleaching. The IR700 fluorescence did
not change for up to two days in tumors receiving hYP218IR700 but not NIR light (Figure 3B). Tumor growth was
significantly inhibited in the NIR-PIT treatment group
compared with the other groups (p < 0.001) (Figure 3C).
Additionally, significantly prolonged survival was achieved
in the NIR-PIT group (p < 0.0001 vs other groups)
(Figure 3D). No significant therapeutic effect was observed
in the control groups including those receiving APC i.v. only
or in mice receiving the NIR light only. There was no skin
necrosis or toxicity attributable to the APC in any group.

Results
In vitro characterization of A431/H9 cell
As defined by SDS-PAGE, the band of hYP218IR700 was almost the same molecular weight as the nonconjugate control, and fluorescence intensity was identical
(Figure 1A). After a 6 h incubation with hYP218-IR700,
A431/H9 cells showed a high fluorescence signal, which
was confirmed with flow cytometry and fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 1B and 1C).
On the other hand, mesothelin negative A431 cells
did not show an increase in fluorescence signal after
hYP218-IR700 incubation. Additionally, this increase in
fluorescence signal was blocked by adding excess hYP218,
indicating that hYP218-IR700 specifically binds to the
mesothelin on A431/H9 cells.

Histological analysis
In frozen histologic specimen, high fluorescence
intensity was shown in A431/H9 cells 24 h after hYP218IR700 injection compared with that in control A431 cells.
On the other hand, the majority of fluorescence signal in
A431/H9 cells disappeared 24 h after NIR-PIT (Figure 4B).
In the H & E stained histologic specimen, NIR-PIT treated
A431/H9 tumors showed diffuse necrosis and microhemorrhage with scattered clusters of remaining damaged
tumor cells. However, no damage was observed in A431/
H9 tumors 24 h after hYP218-IR700 injection without NIR
light exposure (Figure 4C).

In vitro NIR-PIT
Immediately after exposure, NIR light induced
cellular swelling, bleb formation, and rupture of vesicles.
All of these changes are representative of necrotic cell death
(Supplementary Video). Most of these morphologic changes
were observed within 15 min of light exposure (Figure 1C),
indicating rapid induction of necrotic cell death. Based on
incorporation of PI, percentage of cell death increased in
a light dose dependent manner (Figure 1D). Over 80% of
A431/H9 cells died when exposed to 4 J/cm2 of NIR light.
There was no significant cytotoxicity associated with NIR
light alone in the absence of APC and with APC alone
without NIR light.

Discussion
Mesothelin has been reported to be expressed in various
tumors such as malignant mesotheliomas and pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma among others [1–5]. Malignant
mesothelioma is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis
that exhibits high expression of mesothelin [21]. In patients
with unresectable disease, combination chemotherapy is the
most effective therapy, but median overall survival is only
12.1 months [22]. Advanced pancreatic cancer, which also
is a mesothelin expresser, has a median survival of only 11.1
months even after combination chemotherapy [22, 23]. Thus,
the fact that mesothelin is expressed on some aggressive
cancers and that there is limited normal expression of
mesothelin gives impetus to the development of antibodies
targeting the mesothelin antigen [10].
SS1P and MORAb-009 are anti-mesothelin antibodies
that recognize an epitope within the N-terminal Region
I (296–390) of cell surface mesothelin [13]. However,

In vivo fluorescence imaging studies
The fluorescence intensity and TBR of hYP218IR700 in A431/H9 tumors decreased gradually over days
(Figure 2). Similarly, the fluorescence intensity and TBR
of hYP218-IR700 in the liver decreased gradually over
days (Figure 2). To obtain the maximal therapeutic effect
the fluorescence of the APC should be high in the tumor
and low in the background. Tumors still showed high
fluorescence intensity one day after APC injection, while

Region I is a common site for the binding of MUC16
and thus the antibody can be competitively inhibited.
Humanized YP218 is a fully humanized non-Region I antimesothelin, that does not compete with anti-mesothelin
Region I antibodies [14]. The conjugated hYP218-IR700,
achieved adequate tumor TBRs as shown in Figure 2,
indicating that it may be practical for clinical application
during surgical or endoscopic procedures because of its
high TBR on the mesothelin expressing tumors. Efficient
binding and distribution of the antibody in tumors are
important for APCs such as the one described here and
antibody-toxin or antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally,
the drugs and toxins must be internalized after cell binding
in order to be effective. Our results showed that hYP218
bound to mesothelin specifically and was internalized
homogenously within 6 hours of incubation in mesothelin
expressing cancer cells. These results suggest that hYP218
has favorable characteristics for an antibody-drug conjugate.
The conjugate hYP218-IR700 proved to be an
effective agent for treating a mesothelin expressing tumor
model with NIR-PIT. NIR-PIT with hYP218-IR700 led
to rapid cell death in vitro and significant tumor growth
reduction and survival improvement in vivo. Thus, hYP218IR700 could be an effective platform for NIR-PIT in
mesothelin expressing tumors.

The delivery of various nano-sized or macromolecular
drugs to tumor beds increases up to a 24-fold within
8 hours after NIR-PIT compared with that into non-treated
tumor beds. NIR-PIT has been shown to results in super
enhanced permeability and retention (SUPR) effects
[24–26]. When intravenously injected, APCs are delivered
via tumor vasculature into tumor beds. Thus, APCs can
bind to cancer cells in the perivascular space at the highest
concentration. When exposed NIR light, the cancer cells
in the perivascular space are killed leading to a dramatic
increase in vascular permeability. After the first NIR-PIT,
circulating APCs perfuse deep into treated tumor beds and
bind surviving cancer cells. Therefore, the second exposure
to NIR light can further enhance therapeutic effects of NIRPIT [27]. Thus, we chose the current therapeutic regimen
that employed a single injection of APCs and two serial
NIR light exposures.
An obvious limitation of NIR-PIT for mesothelin
expressing tumor is the inability to deliver NIR light to the
tumor. Skin, fat and other organs, will absorb NIR light
before it reaches the tumor. There are several potential
solutions to this problem. For instance, NIR light could
be delivered to a pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma
or pancreatic tumor while the tissues are still exposed
after surgical resection, thus treating residual tumor.

treatment group (n ≥ 10, *p < 0.0001 vs other groups, by Log-rank test).

Alternatively, light could be administered endoscopically,
via a bronchoscope in the case of pleural mesothelioma or
via a gastrointestinal endoscope in the case of pancreatic
cancer. A third possibility is to introduce light fibers
interstitially into tumors using needle trocars, although this
might be of limited value in mesothelioma. Such procedures
have been proposed in the past with PDT, however, we
believe that NIR-PIT would be much more effective with
lower toxicity than PDT [28, 29]. An alternative light based
cell selective cancer therapy is fluorescence guided surgery
which utilized the telomerase-dependent expression of
green fluorescent protein (GFP). This gene is transfected
using adenovirus and allows for curative resection of
various tumors [30–32].However, this therapy requires virus
mediated transfection of the GFP gene into cancer cells.
This might complicate the approval by regulatory agencies
when compared to the antibody based NIR-PIT. Therefore,
NIR-PIT would be technically easier for transitioning into
the clinical practice.
This study has several limitations. The cell line used
demonstrated very high expression of mesothelin. It is known
that there is variable expression in tumors known to express
mesolthelin and some tumors may express insufficient
amounts of antigen for effective NIR-PIT. This study was

also done in an immune incompetent mouse model. As
the immune effects of NIR-PIT are currently unknown,
it is difficult to know whether this will be of benefit to a
patient, although it is anticipated that it will augment the
therapeutic effect. Another caveat in this study is the use of
subcutaneously xenografted human tumors in athymic mice
does not fully represent human cancers. Superior tumor
models including surgically implanted patient derived
orthotopic tumor models, can simulate cancers in patients
better than xenografted tumor models [33, 34]. These
orthotopic models required highly trained surgical skills for
proper implanting of the tumor and are much more invasive
than s.c. injections. Therefore, in this proof-of-principle
study of NIR-PIT targeting mesothelin, we chose a simple
subcutaneous xenograft tumor model. Finally, we only
performed one injection of the APC with two exposures of
light. Clearly, repeated dosing of the APC with repeated light
exposure is likely to increase effectiveness. For instance,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted NIR-PIT
in an appropriate model with a repeated regimen of APC
and light dosing has been reported to improve therapeutic
effect [27, 35]. However, access to this new antibody is still
limited and thus, only single injections of the conjugate were
feasible at the time of this experiment.

Conclusions

medium [SFM4CHO without glutamine (Hyclone)]
supplemented with 25 µM MSX at 0.3−1 × 106 cells/ml.
The hYP218 antibody protein was purified from the culture
supernatant on a Protein A column (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Pittsburgh PA) using an ÄKTA Explorer system
(GE Healthcare, Life Sciences) as previously described [37].

The fully humanized non-Region I anti-mesothelin
antibody, hYP218, demonstrated adequate accumulation
and internalization in mesothelin expressing cancer cells.
The conjugated, hYP218-IR700 and NIR-PIT can be an
effective treatment of a mesothelin expressing animal
tumor model. Impressive, immediate responses were seen
after only a single injection of the conjugate and two light
exposures. It would be desirable to extend these studies
to multiple doses of the APC and light, however, this
awaits improved access to the antibody. If successful,
NIR-PIT in mesothelin expressing, unresectable tumors
such as mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer, could have a
meaningful impact on the survival of such patients.

Synthesis of IR700-conjugated hYP218
Conjugation of dyes with monoclonal antibody was
performed according to previous report [15]. In brief,
hYP218 (1.0 mg, 13.3 nmol) was incubated with IR700
NHS ester (130.3 μg, 66.7 nmol) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4
(pH 8.6) at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture
was purified with a Sephadex G25 column (PD-10;
GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The protein
concentration was determined with Coomassie Plus protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Rockford, IL,
USA) by measuring the absorption at 595 nm with UV-Vis
(8453 Value System; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The concentration of IR700 was measured by
absorption at 689 nm to confirm the number of fluorophore
molecules per mAb. The synthesis was controlled so
that an average of two IR700 molecules was bound to a
single antibody. As a quality control for the conjugate, we
performed sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Conjugate was separated
by SDS-PAGE with a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel
(Life technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). A standard marker
(Crystalgen Inc., Commack, NY) was used as a protein
molecular weight marker. After electrophoresis at 80 V for
2.5 h, the gel was imaged with a Pearl Imager (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) using a 700 nm
fluorescence channel. We used diluted hYP218 as nonconjugated control. The gel was stained with Colloidal Blue
staining to determine the molecular weight of conjugate.

Materials and methods
Reagents
Water soluble, silica-phthalocyanine derivative,
IRDye 700DX NHS ester was obtained from LI-COR
Biosciences (Lincoln, NE, USA). All other chemicals were
of reagent grade.

Production of the hYP218 humanized antibody
Generation of a stable cell line: A high-affinity antimesothelin rabbit Fv was humanized (named hYP218) in
the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, NCI as previously
described [14]. The VH and VL sequences of hYP218
were subcloned into the pDR12 vector (kindly provided
by Dennis Burton, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). The
resulting plasmid (pMH227) was transfected into CHO-S
cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to make a stable line
expressing hYP218 antibody (IgG1 and kappa light chain)
for large scale production. The stable line was generated
following a modified laboratory protocol described
previously [36]. Briefly, the CHO-S cells were cultured
in the F-12K medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin, and transfected with pMH227
using polyethylenimine (PEI 25 Kd linear, PolySciences,
Warrington, PA). Transfected cells were grown for 3 days,
then collected and resuspended in a selection medium
containing the glutamine synthetase inhibitor, L-methionine
sulfoximime (MSX, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) in the
absence of glutamine [Glasgow’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(GMEM) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Hyclone,
Logan, UT), GS supplement, and 25 µM MSX]. Cells were
seeded into 96 well plates at 105 cells/well, and cultured
for 1 month. The wells with stable colonies were further
subcloned and screened for high antibody expression.
Screen for high antibody expression: A sandwich
ELISA was performed to check the antibody titer in culture
supernatant. Clones showing the highest production levels
were expanded and transferred to suspension expression

Cell culture
A431 (epidermal carcinoma) and A431/H9, a cell line
stably expressing human mesothelin [38], were used in this
study. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in tissue culture flasks in a
humidified incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% air
and 5% carbon dioxide.

Flow cytometry
To verify in vitro hYP218-IR700 binding,
fluorescence from cells after incubation with APC was
measured using a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, BD
BioSciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and CellQuest software
(BD BioSciences). A431 and A431/H9 cells (2 × 105) were
seeded into 12 well plates and incubated for 24 h. Medium

To validate the specific binding of the conjugated antibody,
excess antibody (30 µg) was used to block 3 µg of APCs.

weight was also measured. Mice were monitored daily for
their general health and tumor volumes were measured
three times a week until the tumor volume reached
2000 mm3, where upon the mice were euthanized with
inhalation of carbon dioxide gas.

Fluorescence microscopy

In vivo fluorescence imaging studies

To detect the antigen specific localization and
effect of NIR-PIT, fluorescence microscopy was
performed (BX61; Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY,
USA). Ten thousand cells were seeded on cover glass
bottomed dishes and incubated for 24 h. Humanized
YP218-IR700 was then added to the culture medium at
3 µg/ml and incubated for 6 h at 37°C. After incubation,
the cells were washed with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS). The filter set to detect IR700 consisted
of a 590–650 nm excitation filter, a 665–740 nm
band pass emission filter. Transmitted light differential
interference contrast (DIC) images were also acquired.

A431/H9 cells (2 × 106) were injected subcutaneously
in the right dorsum of the mice. Tumors were studied after
they reached volumes of approximately 50 mm3. Serial
ventral and dorsal fluorescence images of IR700 were
obtained with a Pearl Imager using a 700 nm fluorescence
channel before and 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72,
96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after i.v. injection of 100 µg
of hYP218-IR700 via the tail vein. Pearl Cam Software
(LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) was used for analyzing
fluorescence intensities. Region of interests (ROIs) were
placed on the tumor and liver. ROIs were also placed in the
adjacent non-tumor region as background (left dorsum and
lower abdomen). Average fluorescence intensity of each
ROI was calculated. Target-to-background ratio (TBR)
(fluorescence intensities of target/fluorescence intensities
of background) were also calculated (n = 10).

In vitro NIR-PIT
The cytotoxic effects of NIR-PIT with hYP218IR700 were determined by flow cytometric Propidium
Iodide (PI) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) staining,
which can detect compromised cell membranes. Two
hundred thousand cells were seeded into 12 well plates
and incubated for 24 h. Medium was replaced with fresh
culture medium containing 3 µg/ml of hYP218-IR700 and
incubated for 6 h at 37°C. After washing with PBS, PBS
was added and cells were irradiated with a red light-emitting
diode (LED) which emits light at 670-710nm wavelength
(L690-66-60; Marubeni America Co., Santa Clara, CA,
USA) at a power density of 50 mW/cm2 as measured with
an optical power meter (PM 100, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ,
USA). Cells were scratched 1 h after treatment. Then PI was
added in the cell suspension (final 2 µg/ml) and incubated at
room temperature for 30 min, followed by flow cytometry.
Each value represents mean ± standard error of the mean
(s.e.m.) of five experiments.

In vivo NIR-PIT
A431/H9 cells (2 × 106) were injected subcutaneously
in the right dorsum of the mice. Tumors were studied
after they reached volumes of approximately 50 mm3.
To examine the therapeutic effect of in vivo NIR-PIT on
A431/H9 cells, tumor bearing mice were randomized
into 4 groups of at least 10 animals per group for the
following treatments: (1) no treatment (control); (2) 100
µg of hYP218-IR700 i.v., no NIR light exposure (APC
i.v. only); (3) NIR light exposure only, NIR light was
administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 and 100 J/cm2 on day 2
(NIR light only); (4) 100 µg of hYP218-IR700 i.v., NIR light
was administered at 50 J/cm2 on day 1 after injection and
100 J/cm2 on day 2 after injection (NIR-PIT). Serial
fluorescence images, as well as white light images, were
obtained before and after each NIR light exposure (day 1
and day 2) using a Pearl Imager with a 700 nm fluorescence
channel.

Animal and tumor models
All in vivo procedures were conducted in compliance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal
Resources (1996), US National Research Council, and
approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee.
Six to eight week old female homozygote athymic nude
mice were purchased from Charles River (NCI-Frederick,
Frederick, MD). During the procedure, mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane. In order to determine tumor
volume, the greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the
greatest transverse diameter (width) were measured with
an external caliper. Tumor volumes were based on caliper
measurements and were calculated using the following
formula; tumor volume = length × width2 × 0.5. Body

Histological analysis
To detect the antigen specific micro-distribution in
the tumor, fluorescence microscopy was performed. Tumor
xenografts were excised from mice without treatment,
24 h after injection of hYP218-IR700 (APC i.v. only) and
24 h after NIR-PIT. Extracted tumors were frozen with OCT
compound (SAKURA Finetek Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) and
frozen sections (10 µm thick) were prepared. Fluorescence
microscopy was performed using the BX61 microscope
with the following filters; excitation wavelength 590 to

evaluate histological changes light microscopy study was
also performed using Olympus BX61. Extracted tumors
were also placed in 10% formalin and serial 10 µm slice
sections were fixed on glass slide with Hematoxylin and

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± s.e.m. from a
minimum of five experiments, unless otherwise indicated.
Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism
version 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). For
multiple comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni’s correction for
multiple comparisons was used. The cumulative probability
of survival based on volume (2000 mm3) were estimated in
each group with a Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis,
and the results were compared with use of the log-rank test.
Student’s t test was used to compare the treatment effects
with that of control. P-value of < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
