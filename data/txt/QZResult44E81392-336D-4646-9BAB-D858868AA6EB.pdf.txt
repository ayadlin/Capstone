Abstract
Tumor hypoxia is an inherent impediment to cancer treatment that is both clinically significant and
problematic. In this study, we conducted a cell-based screen to identify small molecules that could reverse
the apoptotic resistance of hypoxic cancer cells. Among the compounds, we identified were a structurally related
group that sensitized hypoxic cancer cells to apoptosis by inhibiting the kinases GSK-3b and cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) 1. Combinatorial inhibition of these proteins in hypoxic cancer cells and tumors increased levels of cMyc and decreased expression of c-IAP2 and the central hypoxia response regulator hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF) 1a. In mice, these compounds augmented the hypoxic tumor cell death induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy,
blocking angiogenesis and tumor growth. Taken together, our findings suggest that combinatorial inhibition of
GSK-3b and CDK1 augment the apoptotic sensitivity of hypoxic tumors, and they offer preclinical validation of a
novel and readily translatable strategy to improve cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5265–75. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
A key feature of malignant tumors is the ability to adapt
and survive under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions (1).
Prolonged or recurrent tumor hypoxia selects for cancer
cells with increased survival signaling and loss of apoptotic
potential (2, 3). Tumor hypoxia and expression of hypoxic
biomarkers has been associated with resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapies, and a number of molecularly

targeted therapies including TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; refs. 4, 5).
Multiple agents have been developed that target hypoxic
tumor cells through inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF) 1 (6–8), a master transcriptional regulator. Various
strategies for pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1 activity have
been proposed, including inhibition of HIF-1 transcriptional
activity, suppression of HIF-1a translation through inhibition
of mTOR signaling, as well as increasing HIF-1a proteasomal
degradation (8). Other strategies aim to exploit the hypoxic
phenotype of tumors to increase the achievable therapeutic
dose of cytotoxic chemotherapies by targeting them specifically to hypoxic cells as prodrugs (9, 10).
Here, we have conducted a small molecule screen in cancer
cells cultured under low oxygen conditions to identify compounds which sensitize hypoxic cancer cells to apoptosis. We
identified compounds which sensitize hypoxic tumor cells to
TRAIL or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through the combined inhibition of GSK-3b and cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) 1. We show that inhibition of GSK-3b in hypoxic tumor
cells promotes tumor cell death by elevating c-Myc expression
and reducing c-IAP2 levels in a p53- and HIF-1a–independent
manner. Inhibition of CDK1 results in decreased HIF-1a
expression and transcriptional activity which leads to
apoptotic sensitization of cancer cells and decreased tumor
angiogenesis.

experiments were carried out at 0.2% to 0.5% O2 using the
INVIVO2 Hypoxia Workstation (TOUCAN Technologies).
Human, recombinant, His-tagged TRAIL was produced in
DH5a E. coli and subsequently purified using Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen).
Flow cytometry, sub-G1, and Apostain analysis
Cells were fixed with ethanol (sub-G1) or methanol (Apostain) overnight at 4 C. Cell membranes were permeabilized
using either phosphate citric acid buffer or formamide. For
Apostain, cells were incubated with mouse primary antibody
to ssDNA (F7-26). Cells were incubated with propidium iodide
for 30 minutes at room temperature and then analyzed by flow
cytometry.
Clonogenic survival assay
Cells were fixed (10% methanol, 10% acetic acid) and
stained with crystal violet (0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol).
Quantification of colonies was conducted by solubilizing the
crystal violet in 33% acetic acid and measuring the absorbance
at 540 nm in triplicate for each plate.
Tumor xenograft studies
HCT116 p53þ/þ and HCT116 p53/ cells lines were a gift
from the laboratory of Dr. Bert Vogelstein. SW620 and HT29
cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. One million HCT116 p53/ or SW620 cells were suspended in 50% Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the
flanks of Nu/J mice (Jackson Laboratory). Mice were housed
and maintained in accordance with Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee and state and federal guidelines for the
humane treatment and care of laboratory animals. In vivo
vascular imaging was conducted as described previously (12).
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent
analysis
Resected tumors were weighed then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. CD34 (MEC 14.7; Abcam) primary antibody was
used at a 1:50 dilution. Blood vessel number and area were
quantified per 10 field of view using IP Lab Software.
Pimonidazole (60 mg/kg; Hypoxyprobe) was administered
90 minutes prior to sacrifice of the mice. For quantification
of hypoxic tumor cell apoptosis via immunofluorescence,
tumors were snap frozen in optimum cutting temperature
(OCT) and cryosectioned. Cryosectioned slides were postfixed
for 5 minutes with 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Fixed frozen
sections were sequentially incubated with ApopTag TdT
enzyme (Millipore) for 1 hour for the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay and Hypoxyprobe-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:10;
Hypoxyprobe) at 4 C overnight. Sections were then coincubated with Cy3-antidigoxygenin (1:500) and Cy5-goat antimouse (1:200) for 30 minutes at 37 C.
Statistical analysis
We used the Student's t test assuming unequal variance
(heteroscedastic t test), for calculation of significance. All
values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.

Western blot analysis and siRNA-mediated knockdown
Primary antibodies for caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3,
PARP, phospho-c-Myc (T58/S62), GSK-3b, phospho-b-catenin
(Ser33/37/Thr41), b-catenin, c-IAP2, survivin (Cell Signaling)
were used at a 1:1,000 dilution. HIF1-a (1:500) and RAN
(1:5,000) were from BD Transduction Labs. c-Myc (9E10;
1:200), Mcl-1 (S19; 1:200), CDK1/cdc2/p34 (sc-54; 1:500), and
p-survivin (Thr34; 1:250) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
c-FLIP (NF6; 1:500) was from ALEXIS Biochemicals and
b-actin (Sigma) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. For siRNAmediated gene knockdown, HCT116 p53-null cells were transfected with gene-specific (10 mmol/L) or control siRNA (10
mmol/L; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen).

Results
Hypoxia induces apoptotic resistance in human colon
carcinoma cells lacking p53
We tested the sensitivity of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells
to TRAIL, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and CPT-11. At ambient
oxygen cell culture conditions (normoxia), the absence of
p53 was associated with relative apoptosis resistance in
response to 5-FU and to a lesser extent CPT-11 and TRAIL
(Fig. 1A). This was in accordance with our previous reports
(13, 14). Hypoxic cell culture conditions imparted resistance
following treatment with CPT-11 and 5-FU, regardless of p53
status, while making only the p53-null cells significantly
resistant to TRAIL (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
TRAIL treatment under hypoxia led to less caspase-8 cleavage
and almost complete inhibition of caspase-9, caspase-3, and
PARP cleavage as compared with normoxia (Fig. 1B). Flow
cytometric analysis confirmed the decreased sensitivity of
hypoxic HCT116 p53/ cells to TRAIL, CPT-11, and 5-FU
(Fig. 1C). Other human colon carcinoma cell lines with mutant
or null p53 status also showed hypoxia-induced TRAIL resistance (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next tested whether TRAIL and chemotherapy combinations sensitize resistant HCT116 p53/ cells to apoptosis
under hypoxia. Combinations of chemotherapy and TRAIL
potently induced apoptosis in wild-type and p53-null HCT116
cells under normoxia (Fig. 1D). However, under hypoxic
conditions, the combinations of TRAIL and chemotherapy
induced apoptosis in p53 wild-type cells but failed to induce
significant apoptosis in HCT116 p53-null cells (Fig. 1D). In
addition, the hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ)
failed to sensitize p53-deficient cells to TRAIL under hypoxic
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This prompted us
to conduct a small molecule screen to identify compounds
capable of resensitizing p53-deficient hypoxic colon cancer
cells to apoptosis.
A chemical library screen identifies compounds that
reverse apoptotic resistance in hypoxic cancer cells
The National Cancer Institute chemical diversity library of
1,990 small molecules was screened against hypoxic HCT116
p53/ colon carcinoma cells in the presence of TRAIL
(Fig. 2A). Follow-up analysis of 36 small molecules identified

Figure 1. Hypoxic HCT116 p53/ cells are resistant to therapy-induced apoptosis. A, HCT116 p53þ/þ and p53/ cells were cultured under
normal or low oxygen conditions for 24 hours in the presence of CPT-11, 5-FU, or TRAIL (final 6 hours). A bioluminescence-based assay was employed to
measure caspase-3 activity. B, cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP was assessed by Western blot analysis in TRAIL-treated
(3 hours) HCT116 p53/ cells under normoxia or hypoxia (hyp). C, HCT116 p53/ cells were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 48 hours in
the presence or absence of 5-FU (30 mmol/L), CPT-11 (50 mmol/L), 5-FU and CPT-11 (30/50 mmol/L), or TRAIL (50 ng/mL, 6 hours). Bars represent
mean  SEM (*, P < 0.05). D, caspase-3/7 activity was measured in normoxic and hypoxic HCT116 p53þ/þ and p53/ cells exposed to
combinations of TRAIL, CPT-11, and 5-FU. See also Supplementary Figure S1.

(Supplementary Fig. S2A and Table S1). Four of the 8 small
molecules had structural homology to sangivamycin; hereafter, we refer to them as sangivamycin-like molecules (SLM;
Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S1). At 10 mmol/L, SLM2 and
SLM3 were more potent apoptosis sensitizers than SLM1 or
SLM4 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). At this dose, SLM2 and SLM3
caused significant G2 cell-cycle arrest, whereas SLM1 and
SLM4 did not (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In response to TRAIL
treatment, SLM2 and SLM3 significantly increased caspase-8,

caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation and increased PARP cleavage in hypoxic HCT116 p53/ cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Therefore, SLM2 and SLM3 were selected for further
analysis.
Submicromolar concentrations of SLM3 increased TRAILinduced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2C) and apoptosis (Fig. 2D)
and decreased clonogenic survival (Fig. 2E) compared with
TRAIL alone. Compared with tirapazamine or CPT-11, SLM3
caused significantly greater apoptotic induction under
hypoxia (Fig. 2F). SLM3 also sensitized hypoxic HCT116
p53/ cells to apoptosis induced by 5-FU and CPT-11

effectively sensitize cancer cells, including multidrug resistant
hypoxic cells, to TRAIL and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.

apoptotic sensitization of hypoxic cancer cells, we inhibited c-Myc with siRNA then treated cells with SLM3 and
TRAIL. RNA interference–mediated knockdown of c-Myc
conferred TRAIL resistance in normoxic cells and inhibited
SLM3-mediated TRAIL sensitization in hypoxic cells
(Fig. 3B). In addition, we overexpressed c-Myc in hypoxic
HCT116 p53/ cells which resulted in significant resensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). In hypoxic
cancer cells, we observed an increase in c-IAP2 that
corresponded with decreased c-Myc expression (Fig. 3A),
and treatment with SLM3 resulted in a dose-dependent
decrease in c-IAP2 protein expression, and to a lesser
extent, c-FLIP and Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A and Supplementary
Fig. S3E). Therefore, we hypothesized that c-IAP2 was a
mediator of hypoxia-induced apoptotic resistance in
hypoxic cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited
c-IAP2 with siRNA, which resulted in a significant
increase in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hypoxic HCT116

SLM3 increases c-Myc expression causing apoptotic

To determine the mechanism of SLM3-mediated apoptotic sensitization, we probed for changes in the expression of proteins that are known to mediate TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. We have previously shown that expression of
the c-Myc positively correlates with TRAIL sensitivity (15)
and that hypoxia downregulates c-Myc expression (16).
Upon examination of c-Myc protein levels, we found that
SLM3 induced a dose-dependent increase in c-Myc expression in p53-deficient colon cancer cell lines under hypoxia
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). SLM2 also caused a
significant increase in c-Myc protein expression in hypoxic
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). In HCT116 cells, p53
status did not affect hypoxia-induced downregulation of cMyc or induction of Mxi-1, an antagonist of c-Myc transcriptional activity (Supplementary Fig. S3C and D). To

hypoxic HCT116 p53/ cells, which provided further
protection from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3E). These
data support the role of c-Myc and c-IAP2 in mediating
TRAIL resistance and suggest that induction of c-Myc and
repression of c-IAP2 by SLM contributes to TRAIL resensitization under low oxygen conditions.

GSK-3b, CDK1, and Hypoxic Apoptosis Resistance

p53/ xenograft tumors (Fig. 4B). We next tested the effect of
SLM3 on phosphorylation of b-catenin, another GSK-3b substrate. Consistent with the activity of a GSK-3b inhibitor,
SLM3 inhibited phosphorylation of b-catenin (Fig. 4C). We
conducted a rabbit reticulocyte lysate GSK-3b kinase assay
using c-Myc as protein substrate. SLM3 partially inhibited
GSK-3b kinase activity toward c-Myc in this cell-free system
(Supplementary Fig. S4). To test whether the GSK-3b inhibitory activity of SLM3 is direct, we conducted in vitro kinase
assays using purified recombinant GSK-3b. In this cell-free
system, SLM3 did not inhibit GSK-3b kinase activity (data not
shown), suggesting an indirect mechanism of GSK-3b inhibition by SLM3.
Phosphorylation of c-Myc by GSK-3b at threonine 58 is
known to target the protein for proteasomal degradation (17,
18). Therefore, we conducted cyclohexamide chase experiments to investigate the effects of SLM3 on c-Myc protein
stability. c-Myc protein is highly unstable under hypoxic
conditions, with a half-life of approximately 15 minutes
(Fig. 4D). However, in the presence of SLM3, LiCl, and alster-

paullone (AP), c-Myc protein stability was significantly
increased (Fig. 4D). We also found that SLM3 moderately
induced c-Myc mRNA expression in hypoxic cells through a
b-catenin–independent mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Treatment with other pharmacologic GSK-3b inhibitors also
resulted in increased c-Myc protein expression (Fig. 4E) as well
as increased TRAIL sensitivity (Fig. 4F) in hypoxic cells, albeit
to a lesser extent than SLM3. In addition, siRNA knockdown of
GSK-3b resulted in increased c-Myc protein expression and an
increase in TRAIL-induced apoptosis under hypoxia (Fig. 4G).
Inhibition of CDK1 contributes to the apoptotic
sensitization of hypoxic cancer cells
Upon examination of cell-cycle profiles, we found that the
effects of SLM3 more closely resembled those of the dual GSK3b/CDK inhibitor AP, than LiCl, a selective GSK-3b inhibitor
(Fig. 5A). SLM3 and AP, but not LiCl, caused G2–M phase cellcycle arrest, an effect that is consistent with CDK1 inhibition.
Tumors from mice treated with SLM3 also had a significantly
higher percentage of cells in G2–M phase (Fig. 5B). SLM3

inhibited purified recombinant CDK1/cyclin B in a dosedependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S5), and treatment
with SLM3 resulted in the decreased phosphorylation of the
CDK1 substrate survivin, an affect not observed with GSK-3b–
specific inhibitors LiCl and sc-24020 (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To validate the functional significance of CDK1 inhibition,
we used siRNA to directly inhibit CDK1 in hypoxic HCT116
p53/ cells, which resulted in significant sensitization to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the dualGSK-3b/CDK1 kinase inhibitor AP increased TRAIL-induced
apoptosis to a greater extent than roscovitine, a CDK inhibitor
with little activity toward GSK-3b, and exhibited TRAIL sensitization under hypoxia with efficacy that was comparable to
SLM3 (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S5). When we combined GSK-3b (sc-24020) and CDK inhibitors (roscovitine) in
hypoxic cells, we found that the combination was a more
potent TRAIL sensitizer than either agent alone (Fig. 5E and
Supplementary Fig. S5E). Therefore, combined inhibition of
GSK-3b and CDK1 is an effective strategy for overcoming
resistance to TRAIL under hypoxia.
CDK1 inhibitors increase the apoptotic sensitivity of
hypoxic cells through inhibition of HIF-1a
We discovered that treatment of hypoxic cancer cells with
SLM3 or AP decreased HIF-1a expression (Fig. 6A) and

transcriptional activity (Fig. 6B). Treatment with SLM3 or
AP also resulted in a corresponding decrease in the expression
of the HIF-1 transcriptional target genes VEGF-A and LDH-A
(Fig. 6C). SLM3 and AP inhibited HIF-1a through the targeting
of CDK1, as inhibition of CDK1 with siRNA also decreased
hypoxia-induced HIF-1a expression (Fig. 6D) and transcriptional activity (Fig. 6E). This action is specific to the CDK1
inhibitory activity of SLM3 and AP, as siRNA knockdown of
GSK-3b had no effect on HIF-1a expression (Fig. 6F). Reduction of HIF-1a expression was also not an effect of increased cMyc expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). Likewise, HIF-1a
induction under hypoxia was not responsible for the
decreased expression of c-Myc protein (Supplementary
Fig. S6B).
Treatment with SLM3 had no effect on the half-life of HIF1a protein under hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition,
treatment of hypoxic cells with the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib failed to rescue SLM3-mediated repression of
HIF-1a (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, treatment with
SLM3, AP, and CDK1 siRNA resulted in decreased HIF-1a
mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S6F), suggesting that
inhibition of CDK1 may reduce transcription of HIF-1a. To
directly test the functional significance of HIF-1a inhibition
in hypoxic cancer cells, we inhibited HIF-1a with siRNA,
which resulted in a modest but significant increase in

SLM3 exhibits in vivo antitumor and antiangiogenic
activity and enhances the activity of TRAIL and 5-FU
We next evaluated the in vivo activity of SLM3. Treatment
with SLM3 significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased
peripheral tumor necrosis relative to controls (Fig. 7A and
Supplementary Fig. S7). SLM3 also showed a robust antiangiogenic effect, as tumors from SLM3-treated mice were
significantly less vascular (Fig. 7B and C). In short-term
combination studies, we found that 2 consecutive days of
low-dose SLM3 (12.5 mg/kg) treatment prior to TRAIL treatment significantly increased cleaved (active) caspase-3 staining in SW620 tumor xenografts (Fig. 7D). SLM3 treatment
significantly increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both normoxic and hypoxic tumor tissue (Fig. 7E). We also detected
significant reductions in tumor growth when SLM3 was
combined with 5-FU in studies using both wild-type and
p53-deficient HCT116 tumor xenografts (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Taken together, we propose a model whereby the
combined inhibition of GSK-3b and CDK1 under hypoxia
results in the stabilization of c-Myc and inhibition of HIF1a expression (Fig. 7F).

Discussion
We conducted a chemical screen to identify small molecules that overcome apoptotic resistance in hypoxic tumors,
which uniquely pinpointed compounds that are dual inhibitors of GSK-3b and CDK1. Small molecule kinase inhibitors
with dual specificity for GSK-3b and CDK1 have previously
been described, and this cross-reactivity is attributed to the
similarity in ATP-binding pocket structure of these kinases
(19). The chemical structures of the SLMs identified here are
closely related to sangivamycin, which is a nucleoside analogue that was found nearly 40 years ago to have antitumor
activity. Later studies identified sangivamycin as a potent
inhibitor of protein kinases including protein kinase C
(PKC; ref. 20). More recently some of the SLMs that we
describe here, including SLM3 (NSC188491), were identified
as having potent cancer growth inhibitory and antiangiogenic
activity (21). Like sangivamycin, SLM3 has also been shown to
possess activity as a PKC inhibitor (22). We did not investigate
the role of PKC in regulating the apoptotic sensitivity of
hypoxic cancer cells. However, we believe that PKC represents
a candidate upstream regulator of GSK-3b in hypoxic cancer
cells. Future studies should also address the potential inhibitory activity of SLMs toward other cellular kinases.
GSK-3b is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates
diverse cellular and physiologic processes. In cancer, GSK-3b
is commonly recognized as a putative tumor suppressor due
to its function as a repressor of b-catenin signaling (23), and

the phosphorylation-dependent downregulation of cell-cycle
regulators cyclin D1 (24), cdc25 (25), and c-Myc (17, 18). On the
other hand, GSK-3b can promote cell survival and oppose
apoptosis (26–28). Therefore, GSK-3b functions as a mediator
of cancer cell survival in some contexts, particularly through
the regulation of c-Myc. We have previously reported that
overexpression of c-Myc confers increased sensitivity to
TRAIL, through repression of NF-kB–induced antiapoptotic
factors c-FLIP, Mcl-1, and c-IAP2 (15, 29). Elevated expression
of c-Myc has also been associated with increased sensitivity
and survival of colon carcinoma patients that received 5-FU
treatment (30, 31). Under hypoxic conditions, c-Myc protein
expression and transactivation are repressed. Repression of cMyc activity was shown to occur through HIF1-a–dependent
induction of Mxi-1, a repressor of c-Myc transcriptional
activity (16). In addition, phosphorylation of c-Myc protein
targets it for proteasomal degradation under hypoxic conditions (16, 32). Induction of c-IAP2 in hypoxic cells via an
undescribed, HIF-1–independent mechanism has also been
previously reported (33).
GSK-3b kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials, primarily for
the treatment of type II diabetes and neurodegenerative
disorders. Our data suggest that these inhibitors may also
be good candidates for anticancer drug development. Epidemiologic data show that long-term use of LiCl in patients with
bipolar disorder is not associated with increased cancer
prevalence (34), and LiCl does not increase the number of
tumors in a mutant APC mouse model (35). A recent report
has also shown that pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3 causes
growth inhibition in leukemias with oncogenic MLL mutations (36).
CDK1/cdc2 is a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, which
regulates the mitotic G2–M cell-cycle checkpoint. CDK1 promotes cell survival through the regulation of the antiapoptotic
factors survivin (37, 38) and Mcl-1 (39, 40). The potential of
CDK inhibitors including CDK1 has been proposed for the
treatment of cancer (13), and small molecule CDK inhibitors
are in clinical trials for a number of cancer types. Inhibition of

CDK1 sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (14,
41) and also has a synthetic lethal effect in MEFs overexpressing c-Myc (42). We show that inhibition of CDK1 leads to
apoptotic sensitization in hypoxic cancer cells in part due to
decreased HIF-1a expression and transcriptional activity and
also through decreased survivin phosphorylation. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of CDK1-dependent regulation of HIF-1a expression and activity. Flavopiridol, a pleiotropic kinase inhibitor whose targets include CDKs, was
previously reported to inhibit HIF-1a expression (43). Future
studies should address the specific mechanism of CDK1dependent HIF-1a regulation.
In summary, we have shown the potential for targeting
hypoxic regions of human tumors with novel therapeutic
combinations. Future studies should test dual GSK-3b/
CDK1 inhibitors, such as AP, in other tumor types where tumor
hypoxia is thought to play a role in therapeutic resistance.
