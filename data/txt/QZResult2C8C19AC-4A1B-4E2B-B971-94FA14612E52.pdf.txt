Abstract
Proteasome inhibitors are novel antitumor agents against
multiple myeloma and other malignancies. Despite the
increasing clinical application, the molecular basis of their
antitumor effect has been poorly understood due to the
involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in multiple
cellular metabolisms. Here, we show that treatment of cells
with proteasome inhibitors has no significant effect on
nonhomologous end joining but suppresses homologous
recombination (HR), which plays a key role in DNA doublestrand break (DSB) repair. In this study, we treat human cells
with proteasome inhibitors and show that the inhibition of the
proteasome reduces the efficiency of HR-dependent repair of
an artificial HR substrate. We further show that inhibition of
the proteasome interferes with the activation of Rad51, a key
factor for HR, although it does not affect the activation of
ATM, ;H2AX, or Mre11. These data show that the proteasomemediated destruction is required for the promotion of HR at
an early step. We suggest that the defect in HR-mediated DNA
repair caused by proteasome inhibitors contributes to antitumor effect, as HR plays an essential role in cellular
proliferation. Moreover, because HR plays key roles in the
repair of DSBs caused by chemotherapeutic agents such as
cisplatin and by radiotherapy, proteasome inhibitors may
enhance the efficacy of these treatments through the
suppression of HR-mediated DNA repair pathways. [Cancer

Introduction
The 26S proteasome consists of two components the 19S
regulatory cap and the 20S catalytic core, which degrades
polyubiquitylated proteins (ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; ref. 1).
The proteasome eliminates potentially toxic, oxidized, and
misfolded proteins. In addition, the proteasome degrades various
regulatory proteins that play critical roles in signaling cascade.
Therefore, the proteasome is essential for a large variety of cellular
processes (2). Proteasome inhibitors include natural compounds
(h-lactacystin) and synthetic products (MG132 and bortezomib),
which mostly inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S

proteasome (3). Inhibitors of the proteasome were first shown to
suppress tumor growth in vivo in a murine xenograft model of
lymphoma (4). A number of clinical and preclinical studies have
also shown the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in cancer therapy,
which led to the approval of bortezomib (VELCADE, previously
known as PS-341; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for the
treatment of lymphoid malignancies, particularly of multiple
myeloma (3, 5, 6). Bortezomib has also been shown to have broad
antitumor activity in the screening of National Cancer Institute
tumor cell lines, providing evidence for the use of proteasome
inhibitors against a variety of solid tumors as well as lymphoid
malignancies (7, 8). Besides their intrinsic antitumor effect,
proteasome inhibitors sensitize cells to a variety of DNA-damaging
agents, including ionizing radiation (IR; refs. 9–12). Despite the
increasing clinical application of proteasome inhibitors, the
molecular basis of their antitumor effect has been poorly
understood. In fact, proteasome inhibitors have a variety of
potential therapeutic targets, such as nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB),
c-Jun-NH2-kinase pathway, Bcl family members, endoplasmic
reticulum stress pathways, nucleotide excision repair (NER), and
damage checkpoint proteins including p53 (3, 13). Nonetheless,
suppression of these pathways does not fully account for the
antitumor properties of bortezomib (14, 15).
A number of chemotherapeutic agents and IR kill tumors by
inducing double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 16). There are two major
DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; refs. 17, 18). DSBs induced by
IR are repaired by both HR and NHEJ, indicating a degree of
functional redundancy between these two pathways (19). Importantly, HR plays a dominant role in repairing DSBs caused by
chemotherapeutic agents (20–22). These DSBs are formed when
chemotherapeutic agents generate single-strand breaks that collide
with the replication machinery and give rise to DSBs. These singlestrand breaks are caused by agents, including camptothecin, a
topoisomerase 1 toxin. DSBs caused by replication block at singlestrand breaks are repaired exclusively by HR-mediated DSB repair
(17). HR also plays a critical role in restoring the replication block
caused by chemical cross-linkers, including cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin; ref. 22).
The process of HR is relatively slow but provides accurate repair
of damaged DNA. Genetic and biochemical studies from a number
of species have suggested that HR involves the following distinct
steps. DSBs are initially recognized by the ATM kinase and the
Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, which seem to promote the
resection of DSBs to form 3¶ single-strand overhangs (23–25). DSB
resection also requires Ubc13, an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme (26).
The resulting ssDNA tails are coated by the ssDNA-binding protein

Proteasome Inhibitors Suppress Homologous Recombination

RPA. The RPA-ssDNA complex seems to work as a signaling
intermediate to facilitate the recruitment of ATR-ATRIP (27). RPA
is subsequently replaced by Rad51 with the aid of BRCA1 and
BRCA2, both of which are encoded by genes responsible for familial
breast and ovarian cancers (28–32). The resulting ssDNA-Rad51
nucleoprotein filament then facilitates homology searches and
invades intact homologous duplex DNA to form Holliday junction
intermediates before branch migration and resolution restore the
broken DNA sequences.
Previously, studies done in yeast have suggested that the
proteasome may play a role in DSB repair. Importantly, DSS1 is a
human homologue of the yeast protein Sem1, which is a binding
partner of BRCA2 (28, 33, 34). Sem1 has been shown to be a subunit
of the proteasome and to be involved in both HR and NHEJ (35).
In another study, deletion of proteins required for nuclear proteasome enrichment in yeast resulted in hypersensitivity to genotoxins
(36). However, the involvement of the proteasome in DSB repair in
mammalian cells has not been shown.
We show here that proteasome inhibitors strongly inhibit HRdependent DSB repair but not NHEJ in mammalian cells. In the
presence of proteasome inhibitors, formation of ssDNA/RPA
recombinogenic intermediate was impaired and the subsequent
formation of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments is abolished. These
data reveal a critical and unexpected role for the ubiquitinproteasome pathway in the initial step of HR. We suggest that the
defective HR-mediated DNA repair caused by proteasome inhibitors is one of the key molecular mechanisms underlying their
antitumor effect. We also propose that proteasome inhibitors
synergize with standard chemotherapies through the suppression
of HR-mediated DNA repair.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments. HeLa cells, HeLa cells containing DR-GFP
(32), CAPAN-1, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DT40 cells were cultured in
RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% chicken
serum and 5  105 of h-ME. Cells were kept at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. Proteasome inhibitors, MG132 or h-lactacystin
(Calbiochem; final concentration, 10 Amol/L), were added to the cell culture
1 h before 137Cs g-irradiation (Gammacell 40 Exactor: Nordion) and
maintained in the culture medium until the samples were subjected to
analysis.
Transfection of small interfering RNA. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
duplexes were purchased from IDT. The target sequence for DSS1 was
5¶-AAAGTTGGAACCCTCACTC-3¶. siRNA transfection was done with
200 nmol/L final concentration of oligonucleotides using LipofectAMINE
(Invitrogen Life Technologies).
Transient transfection of DNA into HeLa cells. Transfection was done
using Amaxa neucleofectamin reagent (Solusion R) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5  105 exponentially growing cells
were transfected with 3 Ag of DNA.
Antibodies. Antibodies used in the present study were Rad51 (PC130
rabbit polyclonal antibody, Calbiochem), ATM-pSer1981 (10H11, E12 mouse
monoclonal antibody, Calbiochem), gH2AX (JBW103 mouse monoclonal
antibody, Upstate), SMC1-pSer957 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Bethyl
Laboratories), MRE11 (12D7 mouse monoclonal antibody, Genetex, Inc.),
ATRIP (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Upstate), ATR (goat polyclonal antibody,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), BRCA1 (D-9 mouse monoclonal antibody, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Ub-chain (FK2 mouse monoclonal antibody, Nippon
Biotest Lab), and RPA32-pT21 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Abcam), Chk2
(rabbit polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling), Chk2-pSer33/35 (rabbit
polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling), Chk2-pThr68 (rabbit polyclonal
antibody, Cell Signaling), RPAP32 (mouse polyclonal antibody, Gene Tex).

Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer [62 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors] and boiled
for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis
was done as described earlier by using chemiluminescent detection (26).
The antibodies were diluted to a concentration of 2 Ag/mL.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with PBS containing
0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked in PBS containing 3% of bovine
serum albumin. Antibodies were diluted to a concentration of 1 Ag/mL,
and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed in
PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min followed by visualization with
fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and
anti-goat immunoglobulin Alexa 488/568/647, 1:1,000, Molecular Probes).
After a final wash, cells were mounted in an antifade medium containing
0.75 Ag/mL of 4¶,6¶-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) as a
DNA counterstain. Fluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus
IX81 inverted microscope. Images were processed with Metamorph
software (Nippon Roper).
Laser irradiation. DSBs were generated using two distinct lasers, UV
laser and green light laser. Generation of DSBs by UV-A laser in cells
presensitized by halogenated thymidine analogues has been described
elsewhere (37). Briefly, cells grown on glass bottom dishes were cultured in
the presence of 10 Amol/L BrdUrd (Sigma) for 24 h. FV-1000 confocal twin
scanner microscopy system with a 40 dry (numerical aperture 0.9)
objective lens (Olympus) was used for microirradiation. Cells were
irradiated with an 8 mW 405 nm laser at maximum power ( five line
scans). Operation was assisted by the Fluoview Software supplied by the
manufacturer. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS at the
indicated time points after irradiation, followed by immunocytochemistry.
Generation of DSBs by green light laser was induced as previously described
(38). In brief, 532 nm of the second harmonic of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam
(f2–3 AJ/pulse energy after objective; f4–6 ns pulse duration; 7.5 Hz; just
above the estimated threshold values of optical breakdown in water) was
focused through a 100 Ph3 Neofluar oil immersion objective (NA1.3; Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) in a confocal system (model LSM410; Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging).

Results
Reduced HR-mediated DSB repair in cells treated with
proteasome inhibitors. To explore the role of the proteasome in
DSB repair, we first measured HR-mediated DSB repair after
treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. To
measure the frequency of HR, we used a HeLa cell line that carries
the DR-GFP HR reporter substrate (32). Transient expression of the
meganucleotide restriction enzyme I-Sce1 produces a DSB in one
of the two tandemly localized green fluorescent protein (GFP)
mutant genes in DR-GFP. The DSB can be repaired by intragenic
HR between the two GFP mutant genes, resulting in the restoration
of a functional GFP gene. Thus, the percentage of GFP-positive cells
represents the efficiency of HR-mediated DSB repair (Fig. 1A). The
I-Sce1 expression plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells with and
without treatment with MG132. Twelve hours after MG132
treatment, the percentage of GFP-positive cells were measured by
flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1B). The MG132 treatment significantly decreased the percentage of GFP-positive cells by >98% in
comparison with nontreated cells. Likewise, another proteasome
inhibitor h-lactacystin, which inhibits the proteasome with greater
specificity than MG132, reduced HR-dependent DSB repair by 76%.
These observations suggest that proteasome-mediated protein
degradation contributes to HR-directed DSB repair.
To rule out the possibility that this severe defect of HR was
caused by experimental artifacts, we examined the effect of MG132
treatment on cell viability and on the expression of an intact GFP

The DR-GFP HR substrate has two mutant GFP

transgene. The viability of cells was monitored with time following
exposure of the cells to MG132. The exposure of cells to 10 Amol/L
MG132 had little effect on cell viability up to 24 h posttreatment
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To evaluate the effect of MG132 on gene
expression, we transfected the intact GFP transgene into cells,
incubated them with MG132, and analyzed the percentage of GFP+
cells at 12 h posttreatment. The exposure of cells to MG132 did not
interfere with the expression of the GFP transgene (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Thus, the reduced fraction of GFP+ cells in MG132-treated
HeLa cells (Fig. 1B) is not the result of reduced viability or gene
expression. We therefore conclude that proteasome-mediated
proteolysis may significantly promote HR-mediated DSB repair.
We explored the effect of the proteasome inhibition on NHEJ
using an episomal plasmid assay (39). Figure 1A illustrates a
schematic cartoon of this assay. Briefly, a GFP expression plasmid
was linearized between the promoter and GFP coding sequences by
a restriction enzyme and subsequently transfected into cells.
Religation of this linear plasmid was evaluated by measuring the

fraction of GFP+ cells. Addition of MG132 diminished the
percentage of GFP+ cells only by 33%. Likewise, the addition of
h-lactasystin did not affect the percentage of GFP+ cells. Thus, the
inhibition of the proteasome has a marginal effect, if any, on NHEJ
(Fig. 1C).
To further explore the suppressive effect of MG132 on HR, but
not on NHEJ, we analyzed the effect of MG132 treatment of
chicken DT40 cells deficient in HR or NHEJ (Fig. 1D). We chose
Rad54- and Ku70-deficient DT40 cells as representative mutants,
which are compromised for HR- and NHEJ-dependent repair of
IR-induced DSBs, respectively (19). DSB repair kinetics were
followed by measuring phosphorylated histone H2AX (gH2AX)
focus formation with time after IR. The number of gH2AX foci
decreased with time reflecting the repaired DSBs. Pretreatment
with MG132 delayed the rate of DSB repair in both wild-type and
the Ku70-deficient NHEJ mutant cells. In contrast, MG132
treatment did not delay the repair kinetics in Rad54-deficient
HR mutant cells (Fig. 1D). This observation is in agreement with

the notion that proteasome-dependent protein degradation substantially contributes to HR but not to NHEJ.
Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors suppresses
the recruitment of Rad51, a key recombinase involved in HR,
to sites of IR-induced DSBs. To investigate at which step HR is
impaired by the proteasome inhibition, we first examined the
kinetics of Rad51 subnuclear focus formation, reflecting the
assembly of Rad51 at the ssDNA tail of resected DSBs (Fig. 2A).
We first investigated the formation of Rad51 foci in HeLa cells
treated for 1 h with MG132. Here, we show that treatment of cells
with MG132 significantly reduced the percentage of cells displaying

>10 spontaneous Rad51 foci per cell from 13.6% to 2.9% before IR,
and IR-induced Rad51 foci from 59.3% to 6.3% at 1 h after IR
(Fig. 2B). This defective Rad51 foci formation in the presence of
MG132 was not due to the alteration of the cell cycle profile
(Supplementary Fig. S3), or changes in the level of Rad51
expression in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2C). The abolition of
Rad51 focus formation was also observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblast (Fig. 2D) as well as chicken DT40 cells (data not shown).
IR-induced Rad51 focus formation was also reproducibly suppressed by h-lactacystin (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that
proteasome function is required before the recruitment of Rad51
to DSBs.
IR-induced DSBs are recognized by ATM and MRN complex
in the presence of MG132. To investigate the cause of defective
Rad51 foci formation in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, we
examined whether there were defects in the recognition of DSBs.
Upon the induction of DSBs, the ATM kinase senses IR-induced
DSBs, and immediately becomes activated and autophosphorylated
(24). To analyze if ATM is properly activated by DSBs in the
presence of proteasome inhibitors, we explored the recruitment
and autophosphorylation of ATM to DSBs. To this end, we
examined subnuclear foci containing phosphorylated ATM
(pSer1981). The pretreatment of cells with MG132 did not affect

pATM focus formation 10 min after IR (Fig. 3A). Likewise, MG132
had no effect on the phosphorylation of gH2AX or SMC1, both
of which are ATM substrates (Fig. 3B and C; ref. 40). Collectively,
ATM seems to be quickly activated upon the induction of DSBs
even in the presence of MG132. Following the activation of ATM,
the MRN complex is required to maintain ATM activation (41). To
examine DNA damage signaling following the stimulation of ATM,
we investigated the dynamics of the MRN complex. Here, we show
that the MRN complex accumulated at DSBs induced by UV laser
to the same level in MG132-treated cells as in nontreated control
cells (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these data indicate that the proteasome
function is dispensable for the recruitment of ATM and the MRN
complex to sites of DSBs.
Proteasome inhibitors impair the formation of ssDNA/RPA
recombinogenic intermediate. It has been shown that shortly
after the recognition of DSB ends by ATM and the MRN complex,
the DSB ends are resected to produce a 3¶ ssDNA overhang. The 3¶
ssDNA overhang is then rapidly bound by RPA, a protein complex
that associates with ssDNA (25). This RPA-ssDNA complex seems
to facilitate the recruitment of ATR-ATRIP (27). To assess whether
RPA-ssDNA intermediate molecules are formed, we monitored
phosphorylated RPAp34 accumulation at DSBs before and 60 min
after IR in human cells pretreated with MG132 (Fig. 4A). In MG132untreated control cells, p-RPAp34 foci were detected in <10% of cells
before IR (data not shown). Sixty minutes after exposure to IR, over
90% of nontreated control cells exhibited multiple p-RPAp34 foci in
the nucleus. Strikingly, the pretreatment of cells with MG132
strongly suppressed IR-induced p-RPAp34 foci. These data suggest
the following two possibilities in terms of the function of the
proteasome in the promotion of HR. First, the proteasome may
facilitate the processing of DSBs to generate ssDNA tails bound
by RPA. Alternatively, when the proteasome is inhibited, the RPAssDNA complex is generated but the phosphorylation of RPA
is deficient. Lack of an appropriate antibody to detect the
unphosphorylated form of RPAp34 in immunocytochemical analysis
hampers further investigation.
To gain an insight into the structure of DSBs, we measured the
accumulation of ATRIP and ATR, both of which bind to RPAssDNA (27). In wild-type control cells, ATRIP and ATR were
efficiently recruited to sites of laser-induced DSBs 40 min
posttreatment (Fig. 4B and C). In MG132-treated cells, the
accumulation of ATRIP and ATR was severely attenuated. The
loss of ATRIP recruitment was also observed following treatment
with h-lactacystin (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these data strongly suggest
that the defective HR following proteasome inhibition may be
due to a failure to form an appropriate ssDNA/RPA signaling
intermediate.
Proteasome function is required for IR-induced BRCA1
repair foci. The BRCA1 tumor suppressor constitutes an E3ubiquitin ligase complex and is required for the recruitment of
Rad51 to DSBs in HR-dependent DSB repair (29, 30). Thus, a failure
to efficiently activate and recruit BRCA1 to DSBs could contribute
to the defective Rad51 focus formation in the presence of
proteasome inhibitor. To test this hypothesis, we investigated
whether BRCA1 was activated in the presence of a proteasome
inhibitor. To assess the activation status of BRCA1 following IR,
we examined the phosphorylation of BRCA1, BRCA1 repair foci,
and Ub-conjugate (FK2) foci. BRCA1 is activated through its
phosphorylation on Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 by ATM and on Ser-988
by Chk2. These phosphorylation events were unaffected in the
presence of MG132 (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, MG132

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

treatment reduced the percentage of cells displaying >10
spontaneous BRCA1 foci per cell from 32% to 11% before IR,
and from 74% to 13% (Figs. 5A and 6A) at 1 h after IR. FK2 foci
reflect the ubiquitylation of histone H2AX, and are significantly
reduced in the absence of BRCA1 (26, 29, 42). Like BRCA1 focus
formation, FK2 focus formation was severely impaired (Fig. 5B). In
summary, in MG132-treated cells, although the phosphorylation of
BRCA1 seems to be normally induced by IR, the recruitment of
BRCA1 to DSBs and subsequent ubiquitylation of H2AX were
abolished. Because a recent report indicates the biological
significance of the BRCA1 focus formation in its function (43),

although p-Chk2 was detected in the nucleus, p-Chk2 did not form
IR-induced repair foci (Fig. 5D). These data show that p-Chk2 does
not accumulate at sites of DSB despite its phosphorylation event,
which thus behaves in the same manner with BRCA1. The defective
repair focus formation of p-Chk2 and BRCA1, despite the normal
induction of their phosphorylation following IR, implies that the
phosphorylation is not necessarily sufficient to fully activate the
function of Chk2 and BRCA1.
Proteasome functions to promote DNA repair independently of DSS1 or BRCA2. There are three hypothetical mechanisms
that could explain the proteasome-dependent promotion of HR.
First, the inhibition of the proteasome may deplete the free
ubiquitin pool by inhibiting the recycling of ubiquitin, and
thereby suppress the ubiquitylation of various substrate proteins
in cells (46). However, this possibility is unlikely as MG132
treatment had little effect on the levels of free and H2Aconjugated ubiquitin in our experimental settings (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Second, it has been shown that Dss1 associates with the
proteasome in human and yeast and physically interacts with
Brca2 (28, 33–35). Thus, Brca2 may indirectly recruit the
proteasome to DNA damage through physical interactions with
Dss1. Third, the proteasome may act through the destruction of
unidentified targets.
To examine whether the BRCA2-DSS1 complex acts in HR in the
same manner as the proteasome, the recruitment of repair proteins
in DSS1-depleted HeLa cells and BRCA2 mutant cells (CAPAN-1
cell line) was compared with those in MG132-treated HeLa cells.
Like MG132-treated cells, DSS1-depleted cells and CAPAN-1 cells
exhibited a significant decrease in the number of IR-induced Rad51
foci. These data are consistent with previous reports (ref. 33;
Fig. 6A). In contrast, unlike MG132-treated cells, cells deficient in
the BRCA2-DSS1 complex showed normal levels of BRCA1 focus
formation following IR (Fig. 6A and B). These observations show
that the proteasome functions before the BRCA2-DSS1 complex in
HR. Thus, although the yeast DSS1 orthologue is involved in the
repair of DSBs through its interaction with the proteasome,
vertebrate DSS1 may not functionally interact with the proteasome
in HR-mediated DSB repair.

we favor the idea that BRCA1 is not fully activated in the presence
of the proteosome inhibitor.
To explore the cause of defective recruitment of BRCA1 to repair
foci, we examined the kinetics of Chk2. Chk2 is a known
downstream target of ATM and is also required for the IR-induced
foci formation of BRCA1 (44, 45). Here, we show by Western blot
that the phosphorylations of Chk2 on Thr-68 and Ser-33/35
occurred in the presence of MG132, reflecting that Chk2 is
phosphorylated by ATM (Fig. 5C). We next examined the
localization of p-Chk2 (T68) by immunofluorescence. Interestingly,

Discussion
Here, we provide several different lines of evidence that
collectively suggest that proteasome inhibition strongly suppresses
HR-dependent DSB repair in mammalian cells. First, treatment of
human cells with MG132 and h-lactacystin reduced the efficiency
of HR-dependent repair of an artificial HR substrate (Fig. 1B).
Second, although MG132 treatment delayed the kinetics of DSB
repair in wild-type DT40 cells, addition of MG132 did not reduce
the repair kinetics of HR-deficient cells (Fig. 1D ). Third,
proteasome inhibition prevented IR-induced focus formation of
BRCA1 and Rad51, both of which play important roles in HR (Figs.
2 and 5). These observations shed light on the specific cross-talk
between the proteasome-mediated protein degradation and HRmediated DSB repair pathway. Although proteasome inhibitors
strongly suppress HR-mediated DSB repair, they do not seem to
interfere with NHEJ (Fig. 1C). We also present compelling evidence
that BRCA2-DSS1 is not involved in the proteasome-mediated
promotion of HR in mammalian cells (Fig. 6).
The lack of subnuclear focus formation containing p-RPAp34,
ATR, and ATRIP in the presence of proteasome inhibitors suggests
that the resection of DSBs may be compromised by the inhibition

Figure 6. Proteasome function is required for damage-induced activation of BRCA1 independently of BRCA2-DSS1. A, Rad51 foci formation at 1 h following 5 Gy of IR
is suppressed in MG132-treated HeLa cells, Capan-1 cells, and DSS-depleted HeLa cells (top ). BRCA1 foci formation was induced normally at 1 h following
5 Gy of IR in Capan-1 cells and DSS-depleted HeLa cells but not in MG132-treated HeLa cells (bottom ). Representative picture. Bar, 20 Am. B, BRCA1 foci formation

of the proteasome. One of the outstanding questions raised by this
finding is how the proteasome activates 3¶ overhang formation at
DSBs. A possible scenario is that the proteasome may be required
to overcome the nucleosome/chromatin barrier to resection
(47, 48). Alternatively, the proteasome might be required for the
stimulation of Ubc13 E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, because its defect
causes essentially the same phenotype as that of cells treated with
proteasome inhibitors (29). Another interesting question is how
proteasome-mediated protein degradation activates BRCA1. It
remains elusive whether the resection of DSBs is necessary for
the activation of BRCA1. The present data lead us to propose the
following model. The proteasome might be responsible for the
elimination of the chromatin proteins that inhibit the access of
proteins involved in resection. Accordingly, proteasome-mediated
protein degradation may lead to the formation of 3¶ single-stranded
tail, which is associated with ATR and ATRIP. It is unclear whether
proteasome inhibitors completely suppress the activity of BRCA1,
because although they abolished BRCA1 focus formation, they did
not compromise the phosphorylation of BRCA1 by damage
checkpoint kinases. Irrespective of the activity of BRCA1, the
impaired resection of DSBs alone likely accounts for the loss of
Rad51 foci.
The proteasome-dependent elimination of the chromatin
proteins that prevents the access of repair factors to DNA lesions
is also proposed by a recent finding that in the NER pathway the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway facilitates the recruitment of
xeroderma pigmentosum protein C (XPC; ref. 13). XPC acts in

the initial step of NER to excise UV-induced photoproducts on
genomic DNA (49). It is therefore of great importance to identify
the proteins that are the targets for degradation by the proteasome
in future studies.
We previously showed that the depletion of Rad51, a key factor
of HR, is lethal to the cells due to the defect in the maintenance of
chromosomal integrity in cycling cells (50). Thus, the suppressive
effect of proteasome inhibitors on HR provides us with one of the
molecular explanations for their strong antitumor effect, besides
the suppression of NF-nB by proteasome inhibitors as previously
reported (14). Moreover, the inhibition of HR by proteasome
inhibitors explains why the combination of a proteasome inhibitor
with either conventional chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy
potently enhances the efficacy of the antitumor effects of these
drugs, as HR plays an important role in the cellular tolerance to
cisplatin, camptothecin, and IR. Our study could be directly
exploited to design effective chemotherapy.
