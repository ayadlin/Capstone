Abstract
Herein, using transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, we assessed the ‘‘stage-specific’’ efficacy
of silibinin feeding against prostate cancer (PCa) initiation,
progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, and associated
molecular events involved in silibinin effects during these
stages. Male TRAMP mice starting at ages 4, 12, 20, and
30 weeks of age were fed with control or 1% silibininsupplemented diet for 8 to 15 weeks in stage-specific manners.
At the end of studies, silibinin-fed mice showed less severe
prostatic lesions compared with positive controls. During
early stages of prostate tumor development, silibinin mediated its efficacy mostly via antiproliferative mechanisms.
Feeding of silibinin to animals burdened with higher stages
of prostate tumor significantly decreased tumor grade via
antiproliferative effect, and inhibition of angiogenesis as evidenced by decreased expressions of platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1/CD-31, vascular endothelial growth
factor, and associated receptor, vascular endothelial growth
factor R2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1A, and inducible nitric
oxide synthase. Metastasis to distant organs was decreased
in silibinin-fed mice, which was associated with a decreased
expression of matrix metalloproteinases, mesenchymal markers snail-1, and fibronectin in the prostatic tissue and retention of epithelial characteristics. Together, these findings are
both novel and highly significant in establishing the dual
efficacy of silibinin where it inhibits progression of primary
prostatic tumor and also shows protective efficacy against
angiogenesis and late stage metastasis. These effects of silibinin could have potential implications to improve the morbidity and survival in PCa patients. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6822–30]

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed
malignancy and leading cause of cancer-related deaths in elderly
men (1). One strategy to control this malignancy is its prevention
by natural and/or synthetic agents (2–5). In recent years, transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) is the most
frequently used animal model to evaluate PCa-chemopreventive

efficacy of various agents (6–8). TRAMP mice mimic the
progressive forms of human PCa; the prostatic histopathology
associated with the progression of disease in this model is wellcharacterized and provides a unique opportunity to assess stagespecific preventive efficacy of an agent against PCa (9–12). TRAMP
mice develop spontaneous progressive stages of prostatic disease
[driven by the expression of SV40 early genes (T/t; Tag) specifically
in prostatic epithelium] with time from early lesions of prostate
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to late-stage metastatic adenocarcinoma (11, 13, 14). We recently reported a dose-dependent
inhibitory effect of silibinin ( flavonolignan isolated from the seeds
of milk thistle) on PCa growth and progression in TRAMP mice,
where of all the doses (0.1–1% w/w), 1% silibinin was most
effective, and its anti-PCa effects were neither associated with
any adverse effects nor related to suppression of Tag expression
(15). Regarding practical and translational aspects, the limitation
of this study was that silibinin feeding regimen started at a very
early stage when there was no pathologic evidence of PCa and
continued throughout the experiment (ages 4–24 weeks). This
makes it impractical to extrapolate the findings of such study to
clinical condition where PCa would have been diagnosed in some
pathologic stage. The clinical usefulness of several chemopreventive agents has similar limitations, due to their suggested daily
intake as a preventive measure long before there are any clinical
signs of cancerous lesions. An effective alternative to increase the
clinical applications of these agents would be to test their efficacy
at every stage in tumor development including cancer progression
and metastasis. Once it is established that an agent inhibits
different stages of malignancy, it would broaden the clinical
applications of that agent as well as provide sufficient scientific
rationale justifying its recommendation to a patient with clinical
signs of cancerous lesions.
Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to assess the
stage-specific PCa chemopreventive efficacy of silibinin exploiting the usefulness of TRAMP model where each stage is wellcharacterized and defined (9–12). We fed 1% silibinin in diet to
TRAMP mice at different stages of tumor growth and progression
and then determined the efficacy on tumor growth and progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and elucidated the molecular
events involved in silibinin effects.

Animals, treatment, and necropsy. Heterozygous TRAMP (C57BL/6)
females were cross-bred with nontransgenic C57BL/6 males, and tail DNA
was subjected to PCR-based screening for PB-Tag (14). Routinely obtained
TRAMP males (n = 15–22 mice per group) were distributed into positive
control and treatment groups and, starting at ages 4, 12, 20, or 30 wk,
were fed with control or 1% silibinin-supplemented [1% silibinin (w/w) in

AIN-93M purified] diet and then sacrificed at ages 12, 20, 30, or 45 wk,
respectively (Fig. 1). Hereafter, different groups depending upon their study
period are referred as 4–12-, 12–20-, 20–30-, and 30–45-week groups,
respectively. As overall controls, age-matched nontransgenic mice (n = 5
mice per group) were fed control or 1% silibinin diet for same duration. All
diets were prepared commercially (Dyets, Inc.). Animals were permitted free
access to food and water. Food consumption and animal body weight were
recorded weekly, and animals were monitored daily for general health.
Animal care and treatments were in accordance with Institutional
guidelines and approved protocol.
During necropsy, each mouse was weighed and lower urogenital tract
(LUT), including bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate, was removed
en bloc. LUT wet weight was recorded, and prostate gland was harvested
and microdissected wherever possible (when tumor obscured boundaries of
lobes, it was taken as such). One portion of dorsolateral prostate was snap
frozen and stored at 80jC. All animals were examined for gross pathology;
any evidence of edema, abnormal organ size, or appearance in nontarget
organs was also noted. To ascertain microscopic pathology, these organs
including lung, liver, and kidney were also harvested. Tissues were fixed and
processed conventionally.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Paraffin-embedded sections (5-Am
thick) were deparaffinized and stained using specific primary antibodies
followed by 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, as previously described
(16). Primary antibodies used were against proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; Dako), platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1)/
CD-31, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SV40 large T antigen (BD PharMingen), hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
(HIF-1a; Novartis), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; Abcam).
Biotinylated secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako),
goat anti-rabbit IgG, and rabbit anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Apoptotic cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using Dead End
Colorometric TUNEL System (Promega Corp.). Positive cells were quantified
by counting brown-stained cells among total number of cells at 5 randomly
selected fields at 40 magnification. Immunoreactivity (represented by
intensity of brown staining) was scored as 0 (no staining), +1 (very weak), +2
(weak), +3 (moderate), and +4 (strong). For immunofluorescence (IF)
analyses, tissue sections were double stained with anti-mouse E-cadherin
and anti-rabbit snail-1. Secondary antibodies used were Texas red goat antirabbit IgG and Alexa fluor 488 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes).
Sections were mounted using Vectashield mounting reagent (H-1200)
containing 4–prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs).

Western blot analysis. Dorsolateral prostate samples were analyzed by
immunobloting (17) using primary antibodies against cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk) 2, 4, 6, Cdc2, Cyclin A, B1, VEGF, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)–3, E-cadherin, urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA)
receptor (uPAR), Fibronectin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); MMP–2,
tissue inhibitor or metalloproteinase (TIMP)–2 (Chemicon); Cyclin E,
Kip1/p27 (Neomarkers); Cip1/p21 (Upstate); HIF-1a (Novartis); iNOS, snail1 (Abcam); and MMP-9 (Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies were antirabbit IgG (Cell Signaling), anti-mouse IgG (Amersham), and anti-goat IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal protein loading was confirmed by
reprobing membranes with h-actin antibody (Sigma).
Statistical and microscopic analyses. All statistical analyses were
carried out with Sigma Stat software version 2.03 (Jandel Scientific), and
two-sided P values of <0.05 were considered significant. Fisher’s Exact test
was used to compare incidence of PIN, adenocarcinoma, and metastatic
lesions, and unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test was used for all other data.
Difference between positive control groups was determined by one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Densitometric
analysis of immunoblots (adjusted with h-actin loading control) was by
Scion Image program (NIH), and results are reported based on relative
densities compared with 4–12-week positive control group. Because control
and treated samples were run separately, for comparative densitometric
analysis of different immunoblots for the same protein, a correction factor
was used by loading two control samples along with treatment samples to
correct differences in density due to experimental variations. All microscopic
analyses were done by Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), and
photomicrographs were captured by AxioCam MrC5 camera (Carl Zeiss).
All IF analyses were done by Nikon D Eclipse C1 confocal microscope
(Nikon), and images were captured by EZ-C1 Freeviewer software.

Results
Silibinin feeding reduces LUT weight. Dietary silibinin feeding
did not show any change in diet consumption, and there was
no considerable difference in body weight between silibinin-fed
mice and respective positive control group (data not shown).
At necropsy, silibinin-fed groups showed lesser LUT weight compared with positive controls, although statistically not significant
(data not shown). In nontransgenic mice, silibinin did not show
any change in LUT weight (data not shown).
Silibinin feeding reduces adenocarcinoma incidence. H&Estained sections were microscopically examined and classified as
previously described (15) into (a) low-grade PIN (LGPIN), (b) highgrade PIN (HGPIN), (c) well-differentiated (WD) adenocarcinoma,
(d) moderately differentiated (MD) adenocarcinoma, and (e) poorly
differentiated (PD) adenocarcinoma. Histopathologic evaluation
(Fig. 2A) revealed that at the time of sacrifice in 4–12-week groups,
prostatic tissue in both positive control and silibinin-fed mice was
at the PIN stage, with no evidence of adenocarcinoma in both
groups. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of
LGPIN and HGPIN between silibinin-fed mice and positive
controls. Although the type of PIN did not reveal much, the
sections were reanalyzed for the pattern of PIN (Fig. 2A). It was
observed that there was a higher incidence of diffused pattern of
PIN with extensive involvement of most glands in the positive
control group compared with a higher incidence of mixed pattern
(diffused/focal) with involvement of some glands only in silibininfed group. Only 20% of silibinin-fed mice in 4–12-week group
showed 100% involvement of glands, whereas all animals in
positive control group had 100% of their glands with PIN
characteristics (Fig. 2A). In 12–20-week group, 90% of positive
control mice showed PIN and 10% showed PD adenocarcinoma
characteristics (Fig. 2B). In comparison, there was no evidence of

adenocarcinoma with 100% of mice having PIN in silibinin-fed
12–20-week group. In 20–30-week group, none of the positive
control mice showed PIN characteristics; on the other hand, there
was 15% incidence of LGPIN and 44% incidence of HGPIN in
silibinin-fed group (Fig. 2B). Also, there was 78% and 69% decrease
in the incidence of WD and MD adenocarcinoma in 20–30-week
silibinin-fed group compared with respective positive controls.
Furthermore, a 53% reduction in the incidence of PD adenocarcinoma was observed in silibinin-fed group (Fig. 2B). At the time
of sacrifice, mice in both silibinin-fed and positive control 30–to
45-week group showed large prostatic tumors. However, silibininfed group showed a 7% incidence of WD adenocarcinoma, which
was absent in positive controls that had a relatively higher,
although statistically not significant, incidence of MD and PD
adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2B).
Silibinin feeding reduces tumor grade. To assess severity of
prostatic lesions, histologic data were further analyzed for tumor
grade. Tissues were graded according to the criteria, where (a)
normal epithelium was assigned a score of 1.0, (b) LGPIN as 2.0, (c)
HGPIN as 3.0, (d) WD adenocarcinoma as 4.0, (e) MD adenocar-

cinoma as 5.0, and ( f ) PD adenocarcinoma as 6.0. To generate a
mean peak histologic score, maximum histologic score for individual prostate from each mouse was used to calculate a mean for
that treatment group. There was no difference in tumor grade
between 4–12-week positive control and silibinin-fed groups
(Fig. 2C). In 12–20-week group, silibinin-fed mice had a slightly
lower tumor grade compared with positive controls, although
statistically insignificant; however, a significant reduction in the
severity of lesions was observed in 20–30-week silibinin-fed mice
showing lower tumor grade (mean peak score, 3.5; P < 0.001) than
positive controls (mean peak score, 4.9; Fig. 2C). There was,
however, no significant difference in tumor grade between 30–45week positive control and silibinin-fed groups. The photomicrographs, representative of mean peak histologic score of a treatment
group, are shown in Fig. 2D.
Silibinin feeding reduces proliferation index. Quantification
of PCNA staining showed a decrease in proliferation indices by
25% (P < 0.01), 23%, and 24% (P < 0.02, for both) in 12–20-,
20–30-, and 30–45-week silibinin-fed groups of mice, respectively;
4–12-week silibinin-fed group also decreased proliferation by 26%

but was not significant (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These results
suggest mostly nonstage specific in vivo antiproliferative effect
of silibinin during tumor growth and progression in the prostate
of TRAMP mice. Regarding in vivo stage-specific apoptotic
response of silibinin feeding on prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP
mice, microscopic examination of tissue sections showed an
increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in silibinin-fed groups
(Supplementary Fig. S1B); however, it was significant only in
12–20-week group where silibinin increased apoptotic cells by f5fold (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Silibinin modulates cell cycle regulators. We also determined
the stage specific effect of silibinin feeding on the expression of cell
cycle regulators in the prostate of TRAMP mice. WBs for Cdks,
cyclins, and Cdk inhibitors with densitometric data (adjusted

with h-actin as loading control) are shown in Fig. 3A to C. Here,
it should be noted that membranes were stripped and reprobed for
h-actin for each blot (data not shown). The expression levels of
Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdc2 were significantly increased (P < 0.001) with
progression in 20–30- and 30–45-week positive controls, whereas
Cdk6 levels increased significantly (P < 0.001) in 30–45-week
positive controls. Silibinin feeding in 20–30- and 30–45-week
groups strongly decreased Cdk2 expression by 84–percnt; and 45%
(P < 0.001, for both), respectively, but had no effect in other groups
(Fig. 3A). Cdk4 expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.001)
by silibinin in all groups, except in 30–45-week group (Fig. 3A).
Silibinin also decreased Cdk6 expression by 45% (P < 0.01) and
84% (P < 0.001) in 12–20- and 30–45-week groups, respectively,
which was also evident in 20–30-week group, although statistically

Reactive protein bands for the expression of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdc2,
cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin B1, Cip1/p21, and Kip1/p27 were visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system, and membranes
were stripped and probed with h-actin as loading control. Densitometric
analysis of band intensity for each protein was adjusted with h-actin
(blots not shown). Columns, mean of the four bands from individual
mouse prostate in each group based on the relative densities
compared with the 4–12 positive control group; bars, SE.
Representative blots of two prostate samples from each group are
shown. Difference among the positive control groups was determined
by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test for multiple comparisons,
and values are mentioned only in Results. The difference between the
positive controls versus the respective silibinin-fed group was analyzed
by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. P values of <0.05 were
considered significant. *, P < 0.001; #, P < 0.01; c, P < 0.02; $,

not significant (Fig. 3A). Cdc2 expression was decreased by silibinin
in all treatment groups with 99% (P < 0.02), 92% (P < 0.02), 70%
(P < 0.001), and 36% (P < 0.001) decrease in 4–12-, 12–12-, 20–30-,
and 30–45-week groups, respectively (Fig. 3A). Regarding cyclins
expression, levels of A and E were increased (P < 0.001–P < 0.01)
with progression in 20–30- and 30–45-week positive controls,
whereas B1 levels increased (P < 0.001) after age 12 weeks. Silibinin
feeding significantly decreased cyclin A levels by 96% and 66%
(P < 0.001, for both) in 20–30- and 30–45-week groups, respectively
(Fig. 3B). Levels of cyclin E were decreased by 95% (P < 0.001)
and 96% (P < 0.05) in 12–20- and 20–30-week groups fed with
silibinin, respectively (Fig. 3B). Cyclin B1 was significantly reduced
in all silibinin groups showing 99% (P < 0.001), 96% (P < 0.01), 64%
(P < 0.01), and 24% (P < 0.001) decrease in 4–12-, 12–20-, 20–30-,
and 30–45-week groups, respectively (Fig. 3B).
Regarding Cdk inhibitors, levels of p21 were significantly
increased (P < 0.02) in age groups higher than 4–12 weeks but
were not significantly different from each other. The levels of p21,
although initially decreased by silibinin feeding in 4–12- and
12–20-week groups, significantly increased by 1.5-fold in the
20–30-week group (Fig. 3C). The expression of p27 showed an
increasing trend with progression but only became statistically
significant in 30–45-week positive controls. The expression of p27
in 4–12-week silibinin-fed group was lower compared with
respective positive controls with no difference in 12–20-week
group; however, it was moderately increased in 20–30- and 30–45week groups by silibinin feeding, although statistically not
significant (Fig. 3C).
Silibinin feeding inhibits angiogenesis in TRAMP mice. The
ability of localized carcinoma to further grow and metastasize is
dependent on its ability to recruit new vasculature via angiogenesis
(18). With progression, vasculature invades epithelial layer of the
ducts, and with higher expression of proangiogenic factors, leads
to progression of neoplastic stage to invasive stages (19). Consistent with earlier reports, we observed stage-specific increase in
intraductal microvessel density (MVD; 1.7 F 0.2 in 4–12-week
group versus 43 F 2 in 30–45-week group) with progression from
PIN to WD adenocarcinoma and then to more aggressive tumors
by IHC staining for PECAM-1/CD-31 expression (Fig. 4A). In
prostatic regions with normal histology, capillaries were distributed
in stroma and did not enter epithelial layer of the ducts, whereas in
PIN stages, inward growth of blood vessels was observed. With
progression, number of blood vessels within PIN lesions increased,
and as tumors advanced, blood vessels became larger in size and
showed heterogeneous distribution. In 4–12-week group, silibinin
did not affect intraductal MVD; however, its treatment during 12–
20- and 20–30-week groups significantly decreased MVD by 39% to
50% (P < 0.02, for both). Silibinin feeding also decreased MVD in
30–45-week group, although statistically not significant. Next, we
analyzed the potential molecular events targeted by silibinin for its
antiangiogenic effect.
Silibinin feeding modulates the expression of angiogenesis
regulators. New vascular network developed during angiogenesis is
preceded by an ‘‘angiogenic switch,’’ which involves the expression of
proangiogenic factors including VEGF (20). HIF-1a, a transcription
factor usually induced under hypoxic conditions, regulates the
expression of proangiogenic factors such as VEGF and its receptors
(20–23). Expression of VEGF was found to increase with tumor
progression as determined by IHC (data not shown). Immunoblot
analysis (Fig. 4A) indicated that VEGF expression was significantly
increased (P < 0.01–P < 0.05) in 20–30- and 30–45-week positive

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

controls, and decreased by 81% (P < 0.01) and 32% (P < 0.001) after
silibinin treatment, respectively (Fig. 4A). Regarding the levels of
VEGF receptors, no detectable expression of VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2
was observed till age 20 weeks in positive control group (Fig. 4B);
however, VEGF-R1 expression was detected in 20–30-week positive
control group, which relatively decreased (P < 0.001) in 30–45-week
group. Conversely, expression of VEGF-R2 increased in 30–45-week
group compared with 20–30-week positive controls (Fig. 4B).
Interestingly, the decreasing and increasing expression patterns for
VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2, respectively, with tumor progression, were
reversed by silibinin treatment (Fig. 4B). IHC analysis for HIF-1a
expression (Fig. 4C) indicated more of its cytoplasmic localization in
lower age groups; however, with tumor progression, both nuclear
and cytoplasmic localization was observed. Although HIF-1a
immunoreactivity scores were decreased by silibinin feeding in all
treatment groups, the decrease was significant (P < 0.01) in 20–30week group. These results were corroborated by immunoblot
analysis of prostatic tissue lysates, which indicated that silibinin
feeding significantly decreases HIF-1a expression by 40% (P < 0.01),
45% (P < 0.02), 43% (P < 0.05), and 33% (P < 0.02) in 4–12-,
12–20-, 20–30-, and 30–45-week groups, respectively (Fig. 4C).
HIF-1a is also known to induce iNOS that enhances tumor cell
proliferation, increases the production of angiogenic factors, and
facilitates neovascularization and invasion and, therefore, is a
potential target for inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (24). iNOS
expression was also observed to increase during tumor progression
in TRAMP mice as indicated by increased immunoreactivity scores
from 1 to 2.9 in positive control group (Fig. 4D). Silibinin feeding
significantly decreased (P < 0.05) iNOS immunoreactivity scores in
20–30-week group. Immunoblot analysis also corroborated IHC
results, indicating higher expression of iNOS in positive control
group after age 20 weeks (P < 0.001–P < 0.05), which was significantly
decreased (95%, P < 0.05) by silibinin feeding (Fig. 4D). In 30–45-week
group, although silibinin feeding slightly decreased iNOS levels
(indicated by IHC and WB analyses), it was not significant (Fig. 4D).
These results suggest that silibinin may target VEGF, VEGFR,
HIF-1a, and iNOS expression to inhibit angiogenesis and associated
tumor progression in TRAMP mice.
Silibinin feeding inhibits invasion, migration, and metastasis in TRAMP mice. The proteolytic disruption of extracellular
matrix by secreted or surface-bound proteases, released either from
tumor cells or stromal elements, facilitates the movement of newly
formed vasculature and also results in invasion of tumor cells in to
surrounding stroma (25–27). In TRAMP model, changes in the
expression of proteases, such as MMPs and uPA, and an upregulation of their proteolytic activity are observed in prostate,
which have been associated with invasive, migratory, and metastatic
potential of prostatic tumor (25). In our study, MMPs showed a
stage-specific expression with prostate tumor progression in
TRAMP mice where MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 were expressed
in lower age groups, but their expressions were relatively
significantly higher (P < 0.001–P < 0.01) in 20–30- and 30–
45-week positive controls (Fig. 5A). Silibinin feeding decreased
MMPs expression in all age groups, where it significantly decreased
MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 levels by 78%, 75%, and 100%
(P < 0.001–0.01) in 4–12-week group; MMP-2 and MMP-3 by 80%
and 67% (P < 0.001, for both) in 12–20-week group; and MMP-2 and
MMP-9 by 84% and 74% (P < 0.01, for both) in 20–30-week group,
respectively (Fig. 5A). Silibinin feeding also significantly decreased
MMP-2 expression by 21% (P < 0.05) in 30–45-week group but had no
effect on MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels in this group.

Although protein levels of MMPs increased with prostate tumor
progression in positive control group, the levels of TIMP decreased
at the same time (Fig. 5A). Silibinin feeding did not show any effect
on TIMP-2 expression in 4–12-week group; however, it increased
the expression of TIMP-2 in other treatment groups. Specifically,
TIMP-2 levels were significantly increased (P < 0.001) in 20–30- and
30–45-week silibinin-fed groups (Fig. 5A).
uPAR was moderately up-regulated with tumor progression
(P < 0.01) in 20–30- and 30–45-week positive controls, whereas
silibinin feeding significantly decreased its expression by 71%, 66%,
and 52% (P < 0.001–0.05) in 4–12-, 12–20-, and 20–30-week groups,
respectively, without any considerable effect in 30–45-week group
(Fig. 5B).
The expression of mesenchymal marker fibronectin was
detected after age 20 weeks in positive controls (Fig. 5B). Although

there was no expression of fibronectin till age 30 weeks in silibinin-fed groups, silibinin significantly decreased its level by 95%
(P < 0.001) when fed to 30–45-week group (Fig. 5B). E-cadherin
expression was detected in all groups fed with silibinin, compared
with a loss of E-cadherin expression with the progression of
prostate tumorigenesis in positive controls (Fig. 5B). The expression of snail-1 was also significantly down-regulated by silibinin
feeding, suggesting that silibinin helped in retaining epithelial
characteristics of prostatic tissue during stage-specific treatment
regimens (Fig. 5B). The correlation of E-cadherin and snail
expressions in prostatic tissue was also observed by IF localization
studies (Fig. 5C). We observed that in PIN stage, E-cadherin was
localized on the intercellular junctions; however, during prostate
tumor progression, there was a loss in E-cadherin localization
along with increased nuclear expression of snail-1 (Fig. 5C), indi-

Stage-Specific Effect of Silibinin in TRAMP Mice

cating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during tumor
progression in the prostate of TRAMP mice.
The H&E-stained tissue sections of lung, liver, and kidney of
positive controls and their respective silibinin-fed groups were
microscopically analyzed for metastatic lesions, and their prostatic
origin was confirmed by SV40 T antigen staining. These results
are summarized in Table 1. There were no metastatic lesions till
12 weeks of age in both the groups; however, with increasing age,
more metastatic lesions were observed in positive control groups
and the incidence of which was decreased in silibinin-fed mice.

Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated the stage-specific efficacy
of silibinin treatment against PCa growth and progression in
TRAMP mice. Silibinin was fed to TRAMP mice at different stages of
prostate tumor development, and then its inhibitory effect
on tumor growth, progression, invasion, migration, and metastasis
was evaluated together with the analyses of the molecules possibly involved with silibinin efficacy. Silibinin feeding to mice in
4–12-week group did not show any drastic effect; however, delayed
the onset of neoplastic characteristics in some glands as observed by
less percentage of glands involved in PIN compared with positive
control group showing 100% glands with PIN characteristics.
This observation was supported by a moderate decrease in proliferation index, and at molecular level, by inhibitory effect on
the expression of some of the cell cycle regulatory molecules.
In the 12–20-week group, it was anticipated that all mice would have
developed PIN at the time of starting silibinin treatment
for 8 weeks. Only a few mice showed PD adenocarcinoma
characteristic in the prostate of positive control group, but there
was no incidence of adenocarcinoma in silibinin-fed group; silibinin
also arrested the progression at LGPIN stage. This antiprostate
tumor progression effect of silibinin was accompanied by a decrease
in cell proliferation via modulation of cell cycle regulatory molecules
as well as significantly increased (f5-fold) apoptotic index. The
most significant effect on prostate tumor growth and progression
was observed when silibinin was fed to mice in 20–30-week group. In

this stage, silibinin significantly reduced both tumor grade as well as
prostate adenocarcinoma incidence by slowing down tumor
progression from PIN (premalignant) to adenocarcinoma (malignant) stages. Potential mechanisms for this anti-PCa effect of
silibinin could be most likely a decrease in Cdk-cyclin kinase activity
leading to an inhibition of cell cycle progression accompanied with
decreased cell proliferation. The significance of the effect of silibinin
on p21 expression, showing a marked decrease in 12–20-week group
but an increase in 20–30-week group, remains to be studied. At the
advanced stage, in 30–45-week group, when all the mice had
different stages of adenocarcinoma, although silibinin did not show
any considerable effect on MD and PD stages, it stopped the
progression of WD stage in few mice. Together, based on these study
outcomes, it could be concluded that silibinin would be
most effective in inhibiting PCa progression when the disease is
diagnosed at PIN stage.
Angiogenesis is an important event that facilitates tumor growth,
progression, and metastasis. VEGF is a critical endothelial cell
mitogen that exhibits its effects via two affinity receptors VEGF-R1
and VEGF-R2; these receptors are also expressed in tumor cells
(20, 28). In TRAMP model, angiogenic switch corresponds to a series
of molecular events that comprise of an early ‘‘iniftiation event’’
associated with the expression of HIF-1a and VEGF-R1,
and a later ‘‘progression event’’ associated with the expression of
VEGF-R2, which involves the progression of tumor from a
differentiated stage to a poorly differentiated stage (20, 29). In
TRAMP mice, MVD has been observed to increase with prostate
tumor grade (19). In the present study, silibinin inhibited
angiogenesis as indicated by significant reduction in intraductal
MVD along with decreased expression of VEGF. Furthermore,
angiogenic switch was modified by silibinin feeding as indicated by
altered expressions of VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2. Additionally, silibinin
also decreased the expression of HIF-1a and iNOS that induce
angiogenesis. Overall, these antiangiogenic mechanisms of silibinin
possibly played an important role in the observed suppression of
PCa growth and progression.
The presence of MMPs and uPAR at early stages indicate that
even during PIN development, tissue remodeling exists. In this

NOTE: In the experiment detailed in Fig. 1, at the time of necropsy, any evidence of gross metastatic lesions in nontarget organs was noted. H&E-stained
tissue sections of lung, liver, and kidney of positive controls and their respective silibinin-fed groups were microscopically analyzed for metastatic
lesions. Values are shown as percent of mice having metastatic lesions in particular organ for each group. Fisher’s Exact test was used to compare the
incidence of metastatic lesions in positive control versus silibinin-fed groups. The numbers of animals in 4–12-, 12–20-, 20–30-, and 30–45-wk groups
were 17, 20, 15, and 22 in the positive control groups; and 22, 18, 16, and 15 in the 1% Sb-fed groups, respectively. P values of <0.05 were considered

regard, silibinin significantly inhibited the expression of MMPs and
uPAR and increased the expression of TIMP, indicating a less
invasive potential of the transformed cells. The ability of tumor cells
to migrate and metastasize is attributed to a process known as EMT,
which involves dedifferentiation of glandular epithelial cells into
a mesenchymal phenotype (30). Although differentiation of epithelial cells into invasive migratory mesenchymal cells is a crucial
step in embryonic development, it is potentially destructive if
deregulated and acquired by tumor cells (26, 30). The transcription
factor snail-1 has been implicated in EMT; its expression and nuclear
translocation leads to down-regulation of epithelial genes such as
desmoplakin, Muc-1, occludins, and claudins and to induction of
mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin, vimentin, and MMPs
(26, 31). Snail-1 directly represses the transcription of E-cadherin,
which results in loss of E-cadherin and subsequent dissolution of
E-cadherin–dependant intercellular junctions, loss of cell polarity,
and tissue integrity (26, 31). The mesenchymal characteristics thus
acquired by tumor cells provide them with highly invasive and
migratory potential to metastasize to different organs (26, 30).
In view of above summarized reports, our finding that silibinin
feeding resulted in the retention of epithelial characteristics, indicating a modulatory effect on EMT, is highly significant. In 30–45week group, the prostate pathology at the time of treatment
had already advanced to adenocarcinoma stage. Silibinin feeding at
this stage showed more differentiation in tumors compared with
positive control group, which could be attributed to increased
expression of E-cadherin and an emergence and retention of
epithelial characteristics by silibinin treatment. A decreased
expression of mesenchymal markers fibronectin and snail-1 also
indicated that silibinin had an inhibitory effect on migratory

potential of tumor cells. Consistent with this anticipation, a
reduced incidence of metastasis was expected, and indeed, this was
the case where silibinin treatment showed decreased incidence
of distant metastasis in lung, liver, and kidney.
In summary, the results of this stage-specific study indicate that,
for most part, the tumor grade at the time of treatment determines
the chemopreventive mechanisms for silibinin efficacy. During the
early stages of prostate tumor development, silibinin mediates its
chemopreventive effect mostly by inhibiting the progression at PIN
stage via antiproliferative cell cycle regulatory mechanisms.
However, when the animals are burdened with higher stages of
prostate tumor, silibinin feeding significantly decreases tumor
grade via antiproliferative and antiangiogenesis mechanisms. The
antiangiogenesis together with inhibition of EMT via decreased
expression of MMPs, snail-1, and fibronectin with an increase in
E-cadherin level could account for the antimetastatic effect of
silibinin. Together, our findings suggest that silibinin could be
effective at any stage of PCa diagnosis, and therefore, this nontoxic
phytochemical has wide and potential implications to improve the
morbidity and survival in PCa patients.
