Abstract
Despite the success of medical strategies to reduce androgen levels in the treatment of prostate cancer, this
disease invariably relapses to a castrate-resistant state that is generally fatal. Although it had been thought
that androgen-insensitive cancers no longer relied on the androgen receptor (AR) for growth and survival, it is
now clear that this is not the case. Because relapses are known to occur by many mechanisms that keep the
AR functionally active, strategies to block AR accumulation in the nucleus may be therapeutically useful. Here,
we report the discovery of a selective nuclear androgen receptor exporter (SNARE) that functions to exclude
AR from the nucleus. SNARE-1 binds wild-type and mutant ARs and efficiently inhibits their transactivation
activity and ability to induce PSA gene expression. SNARE-1 inhibits the androgen-sensitive growth of LNCaP
cells and tumor xenografts. Quantitative subcellular localization studies suggest that SNARE-1 inhibits nuclear
translocation of AR, but also facilitates export of nuclear AR that has been translocated by an agonist. Mechanistic studies indicate that SNARE-1 rapidly phosphorylates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and Ser650 of the AR. Additionally, SNARE-1 was found to promote ubiquitination of AR in LNCaP cells. Lastly,
SNARE-1 functions as a tissue-selective AR inhibitor, as it fails to phosphorylate p38 MAPK in U2OS bone cells
that are stably transfected with AR. In summary, SNARE-1 inhibits AR function by a mechanism that is distinct
from clinically available antiandrogens, such that it might inform novel methods to block AR function in
androgen-independent prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 70(2); 842–51. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer
in males and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in
the Western hemisphere. The American Cancer Society estimated that 28,600 prostate cancer–related deaths and
186,000 new cases of prostate cancer occurred in 2008
(American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts and Figures). Risk
factors for prostate cancer span a spectrum including, but
not limited to, age, race, geographic residence, and gene
rearrangements (1). However, androgens (e.g., testosterone)
and the androgen receptor (AR) are necessary for the development of prostate cancer (2). Chemical and surgical
castration of men with prostate cancer leads to tumor regression, suggesting the importance of androgens in the

growth and maintenance of prostate cancer (3, 4). However, after 12 to 18 months, prostate cancer invariably
recurs as a castrate-resistant tumor due to a variety of
reasons (4, 5).
Androgens act in cells by binding to the AR, a member of
the steroid receptor superfamily of transcription factors (6).
In the absence of ligand, AR is maintained in an inactive conformation in the cytoplasm by heat shock proteins. Binding
of ligand dissociates heat shock proteins, leading to translocation of AR and binding to androgen response elements. AR
recruits various coactivators/corepressors and general transcription factors, leading to the transcription or repression of
target genes (7).
Because the growth and maintenance of prostate cancer
is largely controlled by circulating androgens, treatment of
prostate cancer heavily relies on therapies that target AR.
Treatment with AR antagonists such as bicalutamide or hydroxyflutamide to disrupt receptor activation has been successfully used in the past to reduce prostate cancer growth
(8, 9). All currently available AR antagonists competitively
bind AR and recruit corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT
to repress transcription of target genes (10). However, altered intracellular signaling, AR mutations, and increased
expression of coactivators lead to functional impairment
of antagonists or even transformation of antagonists into
agonists (10, 11). Studies have shown that mutation of
W741 and T877 within AR converts bicalutamide and

hydroxyflutamide, respectively, to agonists (12, 13). Similarly, increases in intracellular levels of cytokines recruit
coactivators instead of corepressors to AR-responsive promoters, subsequently converting bicalutamide to an agonist (10).
This positive correlation between AR and prostate cancer
and the lack of a fail-safe AR antagonist emphasize the need
for molecules that inhibit AR function through a novel mechanism that can elicit antagonistic activities within an altered
cellular environment. We initiated a mechanism-based discovery program to identify novel AR antagonists that repress
AR function not only through competitive binding but also
through utilization of intracellular signaling pathways to alter AR nuclear accumulation and degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Here, we present evidence of a
novel AR antagonist, (R)-N-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide
(SNARE-1), which represses AR function by multiple mechanisms ensuring that utilization of alternative mechanisms will not lead to the functional impairment of the
antagonist.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Phospho-Ser650 antibody was obtained from Abcam, Inc., and actin antibody was procured from Chemicon
International.
Cell culture. LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 + 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). U2OS stably transfected with AR
cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium + 1.5 mmol/L L-glutamine + 10% FBS, and COS-1 or HEK-293 cells were grown
in DMEM + 10% FBS. For the chromatin immunoprecipitation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) array assays, cells were plated in 150-mm dishes at 107 per dish in
medium supplemented with 1% charcoal-stripped FBS
(csFBS). The cells were maintained in 1% csFBS for 6 d to
reduce basal occupancy of promoters, with medium changed
on days 1 and 3 and before treatment on day 6.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with AR N-20 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were done as described previously (14). Realtime PCR was done on an ABI 7300 (Applied Biosystems)
using TaqMan PCR master mix at universal condition. The
following PCR primers and probe for PSA enhancer region
were synthesized by Biosource International: PSA enhancer
forward primer, 5′-GCCTGGATCTGAGAGAGATATCATC-3′;
reverse primer, 5′-ACACCTTTTTTTTTCTGGATTGTTG-3′;
probe FAM, 5′-TGCAAGGATGCCTGCTTTACAAACATCC-3′
TAMRA.
Bone marrow culture. Cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen. All animal studies were conducted
using animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the University of Tennessee.
Bone marrow cultures were done as described earlier (15).
After 12 d, the osteoclasts were stained for tartarate-resistant
acid phosphatase activity (TRAP), and cells having 2 or more
nuclei were counted under a microscope (15).

RNA analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR. RNA was
isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and the expression of various genes measured using TaqMan-validated primer probe
mix. The expression of individual genes was normalized to
18S rRNA levels.
Growth assay. LNCaP or PC3 cells were plated at
100,000 per well of a 24-well plate in RPMI supplemented
with 1% csFBS. The cells were treated as indicated in the
figures. Cell viability was measured using sulforhodamine
blue reagent.
Plasmid constructs and transient transfection. Rat AR,
glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, and AR
ligand binding domain (LBD) were cloned from rat cDNA into pCR3.1 vector backbone. Mutant AR plasmids were developed internally at GTx. GRE-LUC and SRC coactivator
plasmids were kindly provided by Drs. Nancy L. Weigel and
Bert W O'Malley (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX).
For transfection, cells were plated at 90,000 per well of a 24well plate in DMEM + 5% csFBS. The cells were transfected
using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with 0.25 μg of GRE-LUC,
0.02 μg of CMV-LUC (renilla luciferase), and 25 ng of receptor. The cells were treated 24 h after transfection as indicated
in the figures, and luciferase assay was done 48 h after transfection. Transfections of p38 or control siRNA (Accel siRNAs,
Dharmacon, Inc.) in LNCaP cells were done in Accell siRNA
transfection medium.
Human phospho-MAPK array. Cells were plated and
maintained in 1% csFBS as indicated above and were treated
with vehicle or SNARE-1 for 45 min. The cells were washed,
harvested, and blotted on human pMAPK array (ARY002,
R&D Biosystems) as instructed by the manufacturer.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blots were done as described earlier (14).
Microscopic experiments. Microscopic experiments were
done at Baylor microscopic core facility in HeLa cells stably
transfected with AR, as described in detail earlier (16).
Xenograft experiment. Nude mice obtained from Harlan
were housed at five animals per cage and were allowed free
access to water and commercial rodent chow (Harlan Teklad
22/5 rodent diet 8640). During the course of the study, the
animals were maintained on a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle. Xenograft tumors were established in nude mice as previously
published (17). Briefly, a mixture of 4:1 LNCaP/stromal cells
(1 × 106 LNCaP cells and 0.25 × 106 stromal cells per animal)
were suspended in 0.0375 mL RPMI + 10% FBS and 0.0625
mL Matrigel per animal and were injected s.c. Once the tumor size reached 100 mm3, the animals were randomized
and treated with vehicle (polyethylene glycol/ethanol/DMSO
at 1:1:2 ratio) or SNARE-1 for 4 wk (n = 9). Tumor volume and
body weight were measured. Tumor volume was calculated
using the following formula: length × width × width × 0.5236.
One animal in the vehicle-treated group and three animals in
the SNARE-1–treated group died due to non–tumor-related
incidents.
Cell cycle analysis was done using propidium iodide
staining as previously described (18). Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling

and treated with a combination of 0.1 nmol/L R1881 and various concentrations of bicalutamide (solid line) or SNARE-1 (broken line). The cells were

R1881 (for AR), aldosterone (for mineralocorticoid receptor), dexamethasone (for glucocorticoid receptor), and various concentrations of SNARE-1.
Cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. Points, mean (n = 3); bars, SE.

(TUNEL) staining and quantification were done by Paragon
Biosciences.
Statistics for animal experiments were done using Wilcoxon
rank sum test.

Results
SNARE-1 inhibits AR function specifically. The AR antagonistic effect of SNARE-1 was tested and compared with that
of bicalutamide. Figure 1A shows that SNARE-1 inhibited
R1881-stimulated AR transactivation with inhibition comparable to that of bicalutamide. SNARE-1 not only inhibited reporter gene activity but also inhibited R1881-induced
transcription of AR target genes, PSA and NK×3.1, in LNCaP
cells (Fig. 1B).
To determine if the AR LBD is necessary for the antagonism, an AR construct lacking LBD was created and tested
in a transactivation assay. SNARE-1 inhibited full-length AR
transactivation but failed to inhibit the constitutive activity
of the AR lacking its LBD (Fig. 1C).
Although the LBDs of glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor share low homology with AR, similarity
in folding of the 12 α-helices makes cross-reactivity between

the ligands a potential problem (19). Hence, the ability of
SNARE-1 to inhibit glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor transactivation was tested. SNARE-1 inhibited
only ligand-induced AR transactivation but had no effect on
glucocorticoid receptor or mineralocorticoid receptor transactivation (Fig. 1D).
SNARE-1 inhibits coactivator-augmented wild-type and
mutant AR transactivation. Earlier studies showed that antagonists fail to inhibit AR and prostate cancer cell growth
when coactivators are overexpressed (20). In addition, overexpression of AR or coactivators led to castrate-resistant
prostate cancer and the conversion of the AR antagonist
bicalutamide into an agonist (21, 22). AR transactivation
studies with SNARE-1 and bicalutamide were done in cells
overexpressing the AR coactivator SRC-2. As shown in Fig. 2A,
overexpression of SRC-2 converted bicalutamide, but not
SNARE-1, into an agonist.
To determine if overexpression of coactivators compromises the function of SNARE-1, cells overexpressing coactivators were treated with R1881 alone or in combination
with 10 μmol/L SNARE-1. Whereas coactivators increased
AR transactivation efficiently, SNARE-1 maintained a dominant antagonistic effect (Fig. 2B) in cells overexpressing
coactivators.

Selective Nuclear Androgen Receptor Exporter

Hundreds of AR mutations exist in prostate cancer, with
many of these mutated AR exhibiting resistance to antagonist treatments. Two well-characterized point mutants in
the AR that have been identified in prostate cancer are the
W741L and T877A mutants (23, 24). Because SNARE-1 is an
arylpropionamide, we also investigated the role of H874 in its
binding to AR (25). Hence, H874 was mutated to phenylalanine (H874F), and transactivation of the wild type and mutants was studied in the presence of SNARE-1 and
bicalutamide. SNARE-1 and bicalutamide inhibited wild-type
AR and T877A- and H874F-AR (Fig. 2C). However, as published earlier (23), bicalutamide failed to inhibit W741L-AR,

and this mutant converted bicalutamide into an agonist. In
contrast, SNARE-1 inhibited transactivation by the W741LAR (Fig. 2C).
SNARE-1 inhibits prostate cancer growth in vitro and
in vivo. LNCaP cell growth assays were done in the presence
or absence of SNARE-1 to examine its AR antagonistic effect
on prostate cancer cell growth. SNARE-1 inhibited LNCaP
proliferation stimulated by R1881 (Fig. 3A) or by full serum
(Fig. 3B). To ensure that the antiproliferative effects of
SNARE-1 are not limited to LNCaP cells alone, growth assay
was done in another AR-positive cell line, VCaP. Similar to
the results obtained in LNCaP, SNARE-1 also inhibited the

growth of VCaP cells, indicating that it is not limited to only
one AR-positive prostate cancer cell line (data not shown).
However, SNARE-1 failed to inhibit the growth of AR-null
PC3 cells (Fig. 3C) or AR-positive androgen-insensitive C4-2
cells (data not shown), indicating that AR expression or androgen dependence is required for its antagonistic activity.
Cell cycle studies were done in LNCaP cells to evaluate the
mechanism of SNARE-1–mediated growth inhibition. SNARE1 treatment (10 μmol/L) led to loss of cells in S phase and
accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 or G2-M phases (Fig. 3D),
indicating a near-complete inhibition of replication and DNA
synthesis. SNARE-1 also differed from bicalutamide (21) in inducing apoptosis of LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S1),
showing that the two antagonists function through different
mechanisms to induce prostate cancer cell death.
We next examined the in vivo pharmacologic effects of
SNARE-1 using an in vivo tumor xenograft model using
LNCaP epithelial and HPS-19B stromal cells (26). SNARE-1
inhibited stromal-epithelial prostate tumor growth by about
50%, with significant differences within 10 days of dosing
and continuing for 4 weeks (Fig. 4A and inset). Furthermore,
there was no change in body weight or serum alanine aminotransferase (data not shown), indicating that the drug did
not elicit apparent toxic effects. At 4 weeks, tumor (Fig. 4B)
and prostate weight (Fig. 4C), markers of androgen action,
were significantly reduced by SNARE-1, indicating effica-

cious antagonistic actions of SNARE-1 in vivo. Serum and
tumor PSA, indicators of the SNARE-1 direct inhibition
of AR activity in tumor, were significantly inhibited by
SNARE-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Serum testosterone was
measured and no statistical difference was observed between the two groups. Interestingly, levator ani, an androgen-responsive muscle, did not show any reduction,
indicating a possible tissue-selective AR antagonistic effect
(data not shown). This effect, however, has to be confirmed
in a Hershberger rat model (27).
Histology was done on the tumor sections to better understand the mechanisms of tumor inhibition and apoptosis induced by SNARE-1. SNARE-1 increased the apoptosis of
tumor cells by 3-fold (Fig. 4D).
SNARE-1 rapidly phosphorylates p38 MAPK and inhibits
AR nuclear localization. The cell cycle arrest in G2-M phase
suggested a possible role of activated p38 MAPK in SNARE-1
antagonism (28–30). In addition, phosphorylation of p38
MAPK has been implicated in antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects (31). This led us to analyze the rapid phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by SNARE-1 in LNCaP cells. SNARE-1
(100 nmol/L) significantly and selectively induced p38 MAPK
phosphorylation, whereas its close partner, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK; B3 and B4 and C3 and C4), or other kinases such as AKT were unaffected (Fig. 5A, left).
Moreover, in concordance with earlier reports identifying

AR phosphorylation at Ser650 by p38 MAPK (32), immunoblot
analyses, using phospho-specific antibody, showed that
SNARE-1 treatment resulted in phosphorylation of AR
Ser650 (Fig. 5A, right).
Ser650 phosphorylation by p38 MAPK is known to lead to
AR nuclear export (32). Because SNARE-1 phosphorylated
p38 MAPK, we examined ligand effects on intracellular AR
trafficking, including its subnuclear organization (e.g., hyperspeckling) as an indicator of AR transcriptional competency related to a poorly understood combination of
interactions with other proteins and DNA (33–35). As published earlier, R1881 induced robust AR translocation and
hyperspeckling (Fig. 5B, top). Bicalutamide induced AR nuclear translocation without hyperspeckling, suggesting that
it mechanistically impairs intranuclear AR functions
through altering effects upon protein and/or DNA interaction. In marked contrast, SNARE-1 treatment resulted in reduced AR translocation and minimal hyperspeckling.
Interestingly, in competition (antagonistic) studies with
0.1 or 1 nmol/L R1881, AR translocation (Fig. 5B, bottom)
and hyperspeckling (Fig. 5B, bottom) were also markedly reduced by SNARE-1 with an IC50 of 100 and 70 nmol/L, respectively. Additionally, brief (∼30 minutes) pulse labeling
of a HaloTag-AR fusion protein with an irreversible fluorescent ligand followed by imaging studies revealed that
SNARE-1 reduced nuclear translocation and facilitated nu-

clear export (Fig. 5C). These findings corroborate the p38
MAPK and Ser650 AR phosphorylation data observed when
LNCaP cells were treated with SNARE-1.
The effects of SNARE-1 on intracellular AR distribution led
us to speculate that R1881-induced recruitment of AR to an
androgen-responsive promoter should be inhibited by
SNARE-1, but not by bicalutamide. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies in LNCaP cells indicated that SNARE-1,
but not bicalutamide, reduced the AR recruitment by
R1881 to the PSA enhancer (Fig. 5D, left), and dose-response
studies indicated that SNARE-1 reduced the presence of
AR on PSA enhancer at concentration as low as 1 μmol/L
(Fig. 5D, right). These results are consistent with reduced
levels of AR in the nucleus as well as with reduction of
nuclear hyperspeckling.
To determine if SNARE-1 induces AR ubiquitination,
LNCaP cells were treated with varying concentrations
of SNARE-1 or 10 nmol/L R1881. Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin
antibodies and then immunoblotted with AR antibody.
Clearly, 10 μmol/L SNARE-1 induced interaction of AR
with ubiquitin proteins, suggesting that AR is marked for
proteasomal degradation when bound to SNARE-1 (Fig. 6A).
To understand if p38 MAPK is the sole mediator of
SNARE-1–dependent AR inhibition and prostate cancer cell
growth, LNCaP cells were transfected with p38 siRNA or

rats were cultured in the presence of RANKL + MCSF (R+M) to differentiate into osteoclasts. The cultures were treated with 10 μmol/L SNARE-1 or
10 nmol/L R1881. After 10 d, the cells were stained and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts was counted. Columns, mean; bars, SE.

PSA gene expression was measured. Figure 6B indicates that
inhibition of p38 MAPK partially reversed the SNARE-1–
mediated inhibition of PSA expression, indicating that p38
MAPK is an important but not the sole contributor to the
inhibitory effects of SNARE-1.
The AR also plays critical roles in bone and muscle function. To test the effect of SNARE-1 on p38 MAPK in an anabolic tissue–based cell line, U2OS bone cells were stably
transfected with AR and then treated with SNARE-1 under
the same conditions as with the LNCaP cells. Phospho-MAPK
array blotting results suggested the absence of p38 MAPK
phosphorylation by SNARE-1 (Fig. 6C). If there is no p38
MAPK phosphorylation, then SNARE-1 may not induce bone
loss and may be a tissue-selective inhibitor of AR function.
To confirm this, we cultured rat bone marrow cells in the

presence of SNARE-1 and stained for TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts. As expected, the positive control, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage
colony stimulating factor (MCSF), but not SNARE-1 or
R1881, induced the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclasts
(Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Although more than 200 molecules targeting several pathways of prostate cancer are in various stages of development,
AR is still considered a central player in castrate-resistant
prostate cancer. Targeting AR directly with an antagonist efficiently reduces its activity. However, eventually antagonism
is lost through several mechanisms. Hence, targeting AR by

Figure 5. A, SNARE-1 rapidly phosphorylates p38 MAPK and Ser650 AR. LNCaP cells were maintained in 1% csFBS for 5 d and treated for 45 min with
vehicle or 100 nmol/L SNARE-1. Protein extracts were made and subjected to pMAPK array. The spots inside the circles indicate p38α and p38γ (B9
and B10 and C9 and C10, respectively). Right, serum-starved LNCaP cells were treated with vehicle, 10 nmol/L R1881, 10 μmol/L bicalutamide, or
SNARE-1. Protein extracts were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted with phospho-Ser650 of AR and actin. B, SNARE-1 exports AR back to the cytoplasm. Top,
HeLa cells stably transfected with GFP-AR were treated with titration of R1881 (triangles), bicalutamide (squares), or SNARE-1 (diamonds). Twenty-four
hours after treatment, the cells were fixed and translocation of AR into the nucleus and AR hyperspeckling were quantified using high-throughput
microscopy. Bottom, cells were treated with a titration of SNARE-1 and 0.1 nmol/L R1881 (squares) or 1 nmol/L R1881 (diamonds) and translocation of AR
into the nucleus and hyperspeckling were quantified. C, SNARE-1 alters AR nuclear organization and promotes nuclear export. HeLa cells were
transiently transfected with HaloTag-AR. Synthesized HaloTag-AR was made fluorescent by a 30-min incubation with HaloTag TMR ligand, an irreversible
red fluorescent ligand (555Ex/585Em), followed by washing, ligand treatments, automated fluorescence microscopy, and image analysis. Nuclear
accumulation and subnuclear distribution of HaloTag-AR after 2 h with vehicle (columns 3), DHT (5 nmol/L; columns 2), or SNARE-1 (3 μmol/L; columns 1);
DHT for 2 h and then either washed and incubated for 16 h in medium with no additives (columns 4) or with SNARE-1 (columns 5); DHT for 2 h and
then either washed and incubated for 2 h in medium with no additives (columns 7) or with SNARE-1 (columns 8); or treated first with SNARE-1 for
2 h followed by DHT for 2 h. D, SNARE-1 inhibits AR recruitment to PSA enhancer. LNCaP cells maintained for 3 d in RPMI + 1% csFBS were pretreated
for 2 h with vehicle, 10 μmol/L of SNARE-1 or bicalutamide (left), or titration of SNARE-1 (right) and subsequently with 0.1 nmol/L R1881 for 1 h.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done with AR antibody as described in Materials and Methods.

multiple mechanisms would be a more efficient method to
inhibit its activity and prostate cancer cell growth.
Recent observation from Dr. Sawyers' group (21) showed
that keeping AR out in the cytoplasm is a valid strategy to
overcome the problem of resistance to antagonist treatment. SNARE-1 follows this strategy mechanistically, and
hence, long-term treatment will not lead to resistance.
Both antagonists (SNARE-1 and RD162 or MDV3100) prevent translocation of AR into the nucleus. In addition,
SNARE-1 also exports the AR that is already present in
the nucleus. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the similarities between the two ligands and their distinction from
bicalutamide.
SNARE-1 is a member of an evolving class of ligands that
inhibit AR function and prostate cancer growth by activating
antiproliferative p38 MAPK, inhibiting nuclear accumulation
by phosphorylating Ser650 of AR and leading to AR ubiquitination. The data presented here suggest that SNARE-1 has
the potential to function as a next-generation treatment for
prostate cancer.
Recent studies indicated that overexpression of coactivators
or depletion of corepressors will lead to a reversal in the pharmacologic profile of bicalutamide, making its function as an
agonist (10). However, SNARE-1 functioned as an antagonist
even when coactivators were overexpressed (Fig. 2B). SNARE1 also retained its antagonistic potential when tested with AR
harboring commonly occurring prostate cancer mutations
(Fig. 2C). These results indicate that SNARE-1 functions at least
one level beyond a simple competitive AR inhibitor.
SNARE-1 inhibited nuclear translocation and facilitated
nuclear export of AR with an IC50 of 100 nmol/L (Fig. 5B
and C), suggesting that altered AR trafficking and subnuclear
organization takes place through mechanisms that are distinct from direct AR binding, such as activation of p38 MAPK
and Ser650 AR phosphorylation (32).
Several studies have highlighted the anticancer properties of p38 MAPK. Activation of p38 MAPK by external

stimuli leads to G2-M arrest and, subsequently, apoptosis
(30). It also functions as a competitive inhibitor of the oncogenic kinase ERK (36). Universal activation of p38 MAPK,
although useful to inhibit tumorigenesis, could lead to inflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, tissue-selective
activation of p38 MAPK is critical to limit side effects. We suspect that SNARE-1 might function as a tissue-selective activator of p38 MAPK because it failed to activate this kinase in
U2OS-AR bone cells (Fig. 6C). siRNA to p38 MAPK partially
reversed androgen-dependent PSA expression, indicating
that p38 MAPK is one mechanism through which SNARE-1
mediates its antiproliferative effects.
Future studies with molecules that target these multiple
pathways will help to increase the potency and efficacy of
their tumor suppressive properties. Studies with androgenindependent prostate cancer cells that express AR are under
way to determine the ability of SNARE-1 to inhibit prostate
cancer cells that have escaped hormone dependency.
