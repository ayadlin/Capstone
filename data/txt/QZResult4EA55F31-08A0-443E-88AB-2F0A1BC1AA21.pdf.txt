ABSTRACT
The natural aging of multicellular organisms is marked by a progressive decline in
the function of cells and tissues. The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues seems
to eventually cause aging of the host. Nevertheless, gene expression that influences
aging is unlikely to be conserved between tissues, and age-related loss of function
seems to depend on a variety of mechanisms. This is a concern when developing antiaging drugs in geriatric clinical pharmacology. We have sought a universal agent to
redundantly cover gene expression despite the variation in differentially expressed
genes between tissues. Using a minimally modified connectivity map, the poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor 1,5-isoquinolinediol was selected as a potent
candidate, simultaneously applicable to various tissues. This choice was validated in
vitro. Treatment of murine embryonic fibroblasts with 1,5-isoquinolinediol appeared
to efficiently suppress the rate of replicative senescence at a concentration of 0.1 µM
without resulting in cell death. The appearance of abnormal nuclei and accumulation
of β-galactosidase in the cytoplasm were inhibited by daily treatment with the agent.
When the aging process was accelerated by hydroxyurea-induced oxidative stress,
the effect was even more noticeable. Thus, 1,5-isoquinolinediol may potentially be
developed as an agent to prolong life.

INTRODUCTION

with a decline in the function of essential organ systems
[3]. There are also several common physiological and
pathological characteristics of aging [4], and aging
simultaneously affects most tissues. For instance,
muscle strength and motor performance are generally
reduced with aging, resulting in loss of function [5].
Neurologically, white matter and the length of nerve

As aging is a main risk factor for many diseases
such as vascular and neurodegenerative disorders,
understanding the mechanism of aging is critical for
maintaining a healthy life and extending the life span [1,
2]. According to the systemic theory, aging is associated

fibers in the motor cortex are decreased [6], and the ability
to transmit information declines accordingly. The aging
process is also associated with basic cellular mechanisms
such as DNA repair and mitochondrial function [7]. At the
molecular level, many genes, including tumor suppressor
or pro-apoptotic genes, have been reported as relevant to
aging or cellular senescence [7]. However, despite many
common genetic alterations in the aging process, the main
mechanisms causing aging seem to differ in each tissue
[7, 8]. Modern cell biology suggests that most diseases
are initiated by the appearance of diseased cells. In this
context, cellular replicative senescence is considered to
lead to aging of the organism [9, 10]. Baker et al. partially
proved this concept with experiments showing that the
removal of senescent cells prolonged the life span of mice
[9]. However, the relationship between senescent cells and
aging in each tissue is not fully understood.
Oxidative and nitrosative stress from reactive
oxygen species plays an important role in the aging
of endothelial cells [11]. These species affect vascular
function as well as endothelial gene expression and
the integrity of the monolayer toward senescence [9].
Mitochondria seem to have a more important role for
the aging in the muscle than in other tissues [5, 12].
Apoptosis is initiated when mitochondrial function
declines and causes energy depletion within the cell.
In turn, mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by an
accumulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules
such as mitochondrial DNA, RNA, and proteins, which
are essential for the optimal functioning of mitochondria
[13]. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanism of
aging can be different in each tissue. These differences
may be one of the reasons for delays in the development
of an anti-aging agent.
To date, a few drugs, including rapamycin and
resveratrol, have presented positive longevity effects.
Resveratrol has been thought of as an activator of sirtuins,
a family of deacetylases (including SIRT1) that could
promote anti-aging effects without restricting the calorie
intake [14-16]. Although recent studies have failed to
prove that resveratrol is beneficial for increasing the
life span in yeast or mice, it could still be used to access
some of the same molecular pathways as those involved
in calorie restriction [17]. While resveratrol has not been
proven to increase life span, rapamycin has shown much
more promise [18]. Rapamycin has been shown to increase
longevity by inhibiting the target of rapamycin kinase
(TOR) through an effect similar to calorie restriction [19].
Testing in model systems that included yeast, nematodes,
flies, and mammals has shown that a reduction in TOR
signaling will result in an increased life span [14, 19].
Despite the few drugs listed above, there is still
a need to develop more drugs to increase longevity. A
drug that can broadly target different genetic alterations
in various tissues during the aging process is particularly
desirable. In order to find an agent to cover several tissues,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we utilized a connectivity map, a recently developed tool
to investigate connections among small molecules that
share a mechanism of action, chemical and physiological
processes, and diseases and drugs [20]. This algorithm
predicted common agents that would cover the agingrelated gene signatures obtained from three different
tissues. A poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1)
inhibitor was finally isolated as a drug that can be applied
effectively on genetically diverse tissues. Through in vitro
validation, we propose 1,5-isoquinolinediol as a universal
anti-aging agent to suppress senescence processes that are
occurring simultaneously in many tissues.

RESULTS
Systematic analysis of aging-associated gene
expression profiles from the muscle, artery, and
frontal gyrus of the brain
Based on previously reported data on aging of the
artery (artery media), muscle (biceps brachii muscles),
and brain (superior frontal gyrus), we rearranged the gene
expression profiles from the GEO datasets for the artery
(GSE16487), muscle (GSE38718), and brain (GSE11882)
to elicit obvious polarity between young and old tissues.
When the gene expression profiles were statistically
compared with thresholds of p < 0.05 and a 1.5-fold
difference, 68 genes were found to be up-regulated and
105 genes were down-regulated in the arteries. In the
muscle, 178 genes were up-regulated and 472 genes were
down-regulated. In the brain, 237 genes were up-regulated
and 287 genes were down-regulated (Figure 1, Figure
S1-3 and Data S1).
The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
listed in parallel among the three different tissues.
The DEGs were divided into 2 groups, designated up
and down, according to the direction of the change in
expression (Figure 1 lower panel). The DEGs were then
expressed as a heat map (Figure 2A) and as Venn diagrams
(Figure 2B and 2C). Although the tissues were analyzed
based on the aging process, no genes were commonly
either up-regulated or down-regulated in all three tissues
(Figure 2B and 2C, respectively).

Connectivity map-based prediction of agents to
cover gene expression profiles among different
tissues
Each DEG list from the three tissues was submitted
to connectivity mapping. From the names of agents
obtained for each tissue, based on enrichment score,
the top 40-ranked genes were listed (Table S1–3), and
chemicals that had an effect on these genes in more than

individuals who were middle-aged. The GEO dataset GSE16487 was used to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the aging
artery (younger: n = 6, older: n = 7). GSE38718 was used to analyze genes related to the aging muscle (younger: n = 7, older: n = 4)
GSE11882 was used to analyze DEGs in the aging brain (younger: n = 12, older: n = 11). DEGs were analyzed by comparing expression
between young and older subjects. The DEGs were sorted using GE2R.

progressed, the proliferation rate, as determined by the
MTT assay, gradually decreased in the control, but the
decrease was not statistically significant. Treatment with
CIB and IQD inhibited the decrease in proliferation. At
passage number six, the inhibitory effect of CIB and
IQD on senescence was particularly remarkable (Figure
4A). Hydroxyurea was used to accelerate the replicative
senescence rate by inducing oxidative stress in MEFs.
The proliferative activity showed a steeper decline
compared with culture conditions without hydroxyurea.
The anti-senescence effect of the two chemicals was
more noticeable from passage number 3 (Figure 4B).
The toxicity of CIB and IQD was then tested because a

cells increased noticeably as the passage number
increased. When IQD was added, the increasing trend for
β-galactosidase-positive cells was diminished (Figure 6A
and 6B). Although hydroxyurea exacerbated the rate of
cellular senescence, IQD significantly ameliorated the rate
(Figure 6C and 6D).

Anti-senescence effect of IQD
We examined the shapes of the nuclei for any
changes corresponding to the number of passages. The
cells showed a more abnormal nuclear shape as passaging
progressed (Figure 5A and 5B). However, treatment with
IQD suppressed the appearance of abnormal nuclei. Even
under oxidative stress conditions, cells incubated with
IQD presented fewer cells containing abnormal nuclei
compared with untreated control cells (Figure 5C and
5D). We further tested the anti-senescence effect using
β-galactosidase staining. Like the results for abnormally

DISCUSSION

and lamin A, which is a protein marker for senescence
(Figure 7). Treatment with IQD inhibited the induction of
PARP1. At passage number 6, cleaved PARP1 appeared
and its expression was also decreased by IQD.
Taken together, these results suggest that IQD could
effectively suppress the senescence rate by decreasing the
activity of PARP1 even under the conditions of oxidative
stress induced by hydroxyurea in our experiment.

According to recent statistics, aging is a risk factor
in the pathogenesis of various diseases [21]Preventing or
slowing aging may decrease the incidence of these diseases
and ultimately extend the human life span. Although antiaging drugs have already been introduced [22], we focused
our attention on the fact that aging-related molecular
mechanisms are basically different between tissues. As

aging is a phenomenon that affects multiple tissues [23],
to simultaneously address these tissue differences seemed
to be critical for the development of more effective antiaging drugs.
We applied a previously developed algorithm called
a connectivity map to identify a potential new anti-aging
drug [20]. The program enables us to predict a particular
agent that induces a particular gene expression signature
by linking a drug to gene expression or, conversely, gene
expression to a drug. Here we input three aging-related
gene expression signatures obtained from the endothelium,
muscle cells, and neurons [22-24]. We did not perform
microarray experiments ourselves, and instead collected
the gene expression data from the GEO profile public
website. Despite the limits imposed by using public data,
information was obtained for three tissues, namely the
artery, muscle, and cerebral cortex, which have importance
in aging-associated diseases [21]. As we intended to find
a universal anti-aging agent applicable to different tissues,
instead cell lines derived from each tissues described
above, MEFs, which are primary cells obtained from
mice, was used to validate the anti-senescence effect. As
the fibroblast has a slightly different function and gene
expression pattern depending on its location [25], it is
considered to reflect the varying genetic backgrounds of
different organs.
Our bioinformatic analysis indicated IQD and CIB
as anti-aging drugs. CIB showed toxicity in our initial
screening. Thus, we continued investigating only the
PARP inhibitor IQD. A decreased ability to repair DNA
damage is related to the aging process, and can cause
premature aging [26], neurodegeneration, and a loss of
diversity in the stem cell compartment [27]. PARP1 is a
well-known DNA repair enzyme. The PARP superfamily
contains at least 17 enzymes that affect several biological
processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA repair,
cell cycle regulation, the hypoxic response, and cell
death [28]. Thus, a PARP inhibitor is logically likely to
inhibit aging. PARPs perform poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation,
which is drastic covalent posttranslational modification
of proteins. This distinctive characteristic is an immediate
cellular response to genotoxic insults induced by ionizing
radiation, alkylating agents, and oxidative stress [28].
Increased activity of PARP1 consumes NAD+, which
is required by SIRT1, thus causing SIRT1 to become
relatively inactivated. As SIRT1 controls energy
homeostasis, decreased activity of SIRT1 may result in
oxidative stress and aging. Depletion of PARP1 increases
NAD+ in the brown adipose tissue and muscle, thereby
activating SIRT1 [29]. In general, PARP1 may work as
a co-activator of nuclear factor-kappa B, which leads to
chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress [30].
The stress damages DNA and aggravates damage to the
telomeres. A faster rate of telomere shortening induces
cell senescence, which accelerates biological aging.
Pharmacological inhibition of PARP could increase NAD+
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels, SIRT1 activity, and oxidative metabolism, leading
to a decrease in oxidative stress and the prevention of
aging [31].
Here, we suggest a potential anti-aging effect of the
PARP1 inhibitor IQD that could simultaneously target
several tissues. At a cellular level, inhibition of PARP1
seems to have an anti-senescence effect. This strategy
may provide a novel antiaging therapy, and have clinical
implications in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of gene expression with age
A linear mixed model was used to examine
variability in gene expression by age, with confounding
factors such as the batch and RNA concentration (only
in skin samples) included as fixed effects, and the family
relationship and zygosity included as random effects.
We fitted the mixed-effects model in R with the lmer
function in the lme4 package. The p-values to assess the
significance of the age effect were calculated from the
chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom using the
likelihood ratio as the test statistic. The p-values adjusted
for multiple testing were computed by controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) with the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure in R and using a threshold of 0.01. Enrichment
analysis was carried out using the DAVID Bioinformatics
Resource server with a threshold level of significance of
0.05 for Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected p-values.

Pharmacogenomic analysis
To define the aging-related gene expression
signature, the probe IDs from each tissue were merged
into categories defined by gene symbols. Those gene
symbols were separated into genes with 2.5-fold up- and
down-regulated expression in the young and old groups
for the connectivity map. The two groups of gene symbols
were converted into the probe IDs of the Affymetrix HG
U133A array for connectivity map analysis [20]. The top
40-ranked chemicals with statistical significance were
selected for each tissue and the lists were compared with
each other to detect overlaps.

Cell and chemical preparation
Murine embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) were
isolated from 12.5-day embryos of C57BL/6 mice and
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM;
Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 2% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells from passage
number 2 were used for all experiments. The chemical

1,5-isoquinolinediol (IQD, CID: 1340) and ionic 4-cyanoN-indan-5-yl-benzamide (CIB, CID : 668646) were
purchased from ChemBridge(CA, US) and Cayman (MI,
US), respectively.

MEFs were washed and solubilized with sodium
dodecyl sulfate; proteins were separated on 10%
polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. The antibodies for PARP-1 (H-250) and
laminA (H-102) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA), and diluted to
1:1000 with 1% skim milk dissolved in TBS-T. Antibody
binding was detected using the ECL Plus enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) with
exposure of X-ray film.

MTT assay
Cell growth was measured using an MTT assay
(Promega, WI, US) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a
density of 5 × 103 cells per well. After treatment with CIB
or IQD (1 µmol/mL) in the presence or absence of pretreatment with hydroxyurea (10 µmol/mL), the cells were
incubated with 5 mg/mL MTT for 4 h. Then, the medium
was removed and 150 µL of solubilization solution and
stop solution was added, followed by incubation at 37
°C for 4 h. The absorbance of the reaction solution was
measured at 570 nm. The cell growth inhibition rate was
(1 − absorbance of experimental group/absorbance of
control group) × 100%.

Senescence revealed by β-galactosidase (SA β-gal)
staining
SA-β-gal staining was performed using the
Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Biovision, CA, US).
Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2%
glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.
The fixed cells were incubated with X-gal staining solution
at 37°C for 24 h after PBS washing. Blue colored cells
were visualized. Using 200X objective lens of microscopy,
the number of blue colored cells was counted in random
four different fields of view (FOV)

LDH assay
After cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 5 ×
104 cells per well, they were treated with CIB and IQD
(1 µmol/mL) for 1 to 7 days. The media were prepared
separately. For the LDH assay, an LDH Cytotoxicity
Assay kit (Cayman MI, US) was used as described by
the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 °C
and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells
were seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 ×
104 cells per well. After 48 h, 100 µL of the supernatant
of the cultured cells was transferred from each well to the
corresponding wells of a new plate, and 100 µL of reaction
solution was added to each well. Plates were incubated
with gentle shaking on an orbital shaker for 30 min at
room temperature. The absorbance was read at 490 nm
using a plate reader.
