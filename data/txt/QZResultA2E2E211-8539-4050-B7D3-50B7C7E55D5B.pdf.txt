SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Which genetic alterations drive tumorigenesis and how they evolve over the course of disease and
therapy are central questions in cancer biology. We identify 44 recurrently mutated genes and 11
recurrent somatic copy number variations through whole-exome sequencing of 538 chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and matched germline DNA samples, 278 of which were collected in
a prospective clinical trial. These include previously unrecognized cancer drivers (RPS15, IKZF3)
and collectively identify RNA processing and export, MYC activity and MAPK signaling as
central pathways involved in CLL. Clonality analysis of this large dataset further enabled
reconstruction of temporal relationships between driver events. Direct comparison between
matched pre-treatment and relapse samples from 59 patients demonstrated highly frequent clonal
evolution. Thus, large sequencing datasets of clinically informative samples enable the discovery
of novel cancer genes and the network of relationships between the driver events and their impact
on disease relapse and clinical outcome.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

In recent years, unbiased massively parallel sequencing of whole exomes (WES) in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has yielded fresh insights into the genetic basis of this
disease1-4. Two important constraints have limited previous WES analyses. First, cohort size
is critical for statistical inference of cancer drivers5, and prior CLL WES series3 had a power
of only 68%, 23% and 7%, to detect putative CLL genes mutated in 5%, 3% and 2% of
patients, respectively (http://www.tumorportal.org/power)5. Limited cohort size has also
curtailed the ability to effectively learn the relationships between CLL driver events, such as
their co-occurrence and the temporal order of their acquisition. Second, the composition of
the cohort of prior WES studies has limited the ability to accurately determine the impact of
drivers and clonal heterogeneity on clinical outcome since they included samples collected
at variable times from subjects exposed to a variety of therapies.
To overcome these challenges, we analyzed WES data from 538 CLLs, including 278 pretreatment samples collected from subjects enrolled on the phase III CLL8 study6. This trial
established the combination of fludarabine (F), cyclophosphamide (C) and rituximab (R) as

the current standard-of-care first-line treatment for patients of good physical fitness, with a
median of >6 years of follow-up. We herein report the discovery of novel CLL cancer genes,
the comprehensive genetic characterization of samples from patients prior to exposure to a
uniform and contemporary treatment, and the uncovering of features contributing to relapse
from this therapy.

RESULTS
Unbiased candidate CLL genes discovery

Author Manuscript

We performed WES of CLL and matched germline samples, collected from 278 subjects
enrolled on the CLL8 trial, with mean read depth of 95.0 and 95.7, respectively
(Supplementary Tables 1 & 2). Consistent with previous CLL WES studies, we detected a
mean+/−SD rate of 21.5+/−7.9 silent and non-silent single nucleotide variants [sSNVs] and
somatic insertions and deletions [sINDELs] per exome (Supplementary Tables 2 & 3)1,3.
We inferred candidate cancer genes in CLL through implementation of MutSig2CV5,7. To
maximize statistical sensitivity for driver detection5 we combined the CLL8 cohort with two
previously reported and non-overlapping WES cohorts1,3, thereby increasing the size of the
cohort to 538 CLLs. This cohort size is expected to saturate candidate CLL gene discovery
for genes mutated in 5% of patients, and provides 94% and 61% power to detect genes
mutated in 3% and 2% of patients, respectively5.

Author Manuscript

We detected 44 putative CLL driver genes, including 18 CLL mutated drivers that we
previously identified3, as well as 26 additional putative CLL genes (Fig. 1-2, Extended Data
Fig. 1-2). In total, 33.5% of CLLs harbored mutation in at least one of these 26 additional
genes. Targeted DNA sequencing as well as variant allele expression by RNAseq
demonstrated high rates of orthogonal validation (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Of the newly identified putative cancer genes, some were previously suggested as CLL
drivers in studies using other detection platforms. For example, the suppressor of MYC
MGA (n=17, 3.2%), which we detected as recurrently inactivated by insertions and nonsense
mutations, was previously found to be inactivated through deletions8 and truncating
mutations8,9 in high-risk CLL (Extended Data Fig. 4). A gene set enrichment analysis of
matched RNAseq data revealed down-regulation of genes that are suppressed upon MYC
activation in B-cells10 (Supplementary Table 4). In addition to MGA, we report two
additional candidate driver genes that likely modulate MYC activity (PTPN1111 [n=7, 1.3%]
and FUBP112 [n=9, 1.7%]), highlighting MYC-related proteins as drivers of CLL.

Author Manuscript

Another cellular process affected by novel CLL drivers is the MAPK-ERK pathway, with
8.7% of patients harboring at least one mutation in CLL genes in this pathway. These
included mutations in RAS genes (NRAS, n=9 and KRAS n=14, totaling 4.1%); BRAF
(n=21, 3.7%); or the novel putative driver MAP2K1 (n=12, 2%). This finding suggests
further therapeutic exploration of MAPK-ERK pathway inhibitors in CLL. Intriguingly,
BRAF mutations in CLL did not involve the canonical hotspot (V600E) seen in other
malignancies5,13,14, but rather clustered heavily around the activation segment of the kinase
domain (Fig. 2). This may hint at a different mechanism of activity15,16, and has clinical

implications, as BRAF inhibitors are thought to be less effective for non-canonical BRAF
mutations17,18.
In addition to highlighting novel cellular processes and pathways affected in CLL, many of
the 26 additional CLL genes more densely annotated pathways or functional categories
previously identified in CLL19, including RNA processing and export (FUBP1, XPO4,
ESWR1, NXF1), DNA damage (CHEK2, BRCC3, ELF420 and DYRK1A21), chromatin
modification (ASXL1, HIST1H1B, BAZ2B, IKZF3) and B cell activity related pathways
(TRAF2, TRAF3, CARD11).

Author Manuscript

We discovered a number of putative CLL drivers previously unrecognized in human cancer.
In a first example, we found that RPS15 was recurrently mutated (n=23, 4.3%), with
mutations localized to the C-terminal region (Fig. 2) at highly conserved sites (median
conservation score of 94/100). This component of the S40 ribosomal subunit, has not been
extensively studied in cancer, although rare mutations have been identified in DiamondBlackfan anemia22. A gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of gene sets
related to adverse outcome in CLL as well as immune response gene sets (Supplementary
Table 4). In another example of a previously unrecognized cancer gene, we identified
recurrent L162R substitutions (n=11, 2.0%) in IKZF3, targeting a highly conserved amino
acid (93/100 conservation score). This gene is a key transcription factor in B cell
development23, and its upregulation has been associated with adverse outcome24,25.

Author Manuscript

In addition to sSNVs and sINDELs, we characterized somatic copy number variations
(sCNVs) directly from the WES data (Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary Tables 5 & 6).
When we accounted for all 55 identified driver events – including non-silent sSNVs and
sINDELs in putative CLL genes (n=44), and recurrent sCNVs (n=11) —91.1% of CLLs
contained at least one driver. Moreover, 65.4% of CLLs now harbor at least 2 drivers, and
44.4% at least 3 drivers, compared with 55.9% and 31.8% were we to exclude the 26
additional CLL genes.
Drivers and CLL characteristics
The larger cohort size also provided statistical power to examine associations between
genetic alterations and key CLL features. First, we examined whether mutations differed
between IGHV mutated and unmutated subtypes, the two main subtypes of CLL. In
agreement with the relative clinical aggressiveness of IGHV unmutated CLL, most drivers
were found in a higher proportion in this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 6A). Only three
driver genes were enriched in the IGHV mutated CLL (del(13q), MYD88, CHD2),
suggesting a role for these specific alterations within the oncogenic process of this subtype.

Author Manuscript

Second, since therapy could lead to selection of particular driver events, we examined the 33
samples (6.2%, none enrolled on CLL8) that had received therapy prior to sampling. Prior
treatment was associated with enrichment in TP53 and BIRC3 mutations, del(17p) and
del(11q) as previously indicated26, as well as in mutated DDX3X and MAP2K1, suggesting
their selection by therapeutic interventions (Extended Data Fig. 6B).

Third, we examined whether coherent patterns of co-occurrence of driver events were
evident, limiting our analysis to the 31 drivers with >10 affected patients. Of 465 possible
pairs, 11 combinations had statistically significant high or low co-occurrence (Extended
Data Fig. 6C-D). As expected, a high degree of co-occurrence was found between mutated
TP53 and del(17p), and between mutated ATM and del(11q). Both mutated ATM and
del(11q) significantly co-occurred with amp(2p), and associations between presence of
tri(12) with mutated BIRC3 and with mutated BCOR were also found. A significantly low
rate of co-occurrence was seen between del(13q) and tri(12).

Author Manuscript

Fourth, we examined the temporal sequence of driver acquisition in the evolutionary history
of CLL. To do this, we computed the cancer-cell fraction (CCF) of each mutation across the
538 samples, and identified mutations as either clonal or subclonal27 (58.1% of mutations
classified as subclonal). Both clonal and subclonal sSNVs were similarly dominated by C>T
transitions at C*pG sites (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Author Manuscript

We first classified driver events likely acquired earlier or later in the disease course based on
the proportion of cases in which the driver was found as clonal (Fig. 3A). This large dataset
further enabled the inference of temporal relationships between pairs of drivers. We
systematically identified instances in which a clonal driver was found together with a
subclonal driver within the same sample, as these pairs reflect the acquisition of one lesion
(clonal) followed by another (subclonal), providing a temporal ‘edge’ leading from the
former to the latter28,29. For each driver, we calculated the relative enrichment of out-going
edges compared to in-going edges to define early, late and intermediary drivers
(Supplementary Table 7). For 23 pairs connected by at least 5 edges, we further established
the temporal relationship between the two drivers in each pair, and thereby constructed a
temporal map of the evolutionary trajectories of CLL (Supplementary Table 8, Fig. 3B).
This network highlights sCNVs as the earliest events with two distinct points of departure
involving del(13q) and tri(12). It further demonstrates an early convergence towards
del(11q) and substantial diversity in late drivers. Finally, this analysis suggests that in the
case of the tumor suppressor genes ATM and BIRC3, copy loss precedes sSNVs and
sINDELs in biallelic inactivation.
Impact on clinical outcome

Author Manuscript

We examined whether presence of any of the drivers detected in at least 10 of the 278 pretreatment CLL8 samples was associated with impact on clinical outcome (Fig. 4A,
Extended Data Fig. 8-9; the genomics analysis team was blinded to the clinical outcome
data). Previous investigations suggested an impact for 7 CLL genes (SF3B1, ATM, TP53,
XPO1, EGR2, POT1 and BIRC3)30-33. We found shorter progression-free survival (PFS)
associated only with TP53 and SF3B1 mutations. Of the newly identified recurrent lesions
evaluated (MGA, BRAF and RPS15), we observed a shorter PFS with mutated RPS15
(Bonferroni P = 0.024).
Presence of a detectable pre-treatment subclonal driver has been previously associated with
shorter remissions in patients treated with heterogeneous therapies3. In the CLL8 cohort, we
again found that the presence of a pre-treatment subclonal driver was associated with a
significantly shorter PFS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.6 [95%CI 1.2-2.2, P = 0.004). This

association remained significant in both the FC and FCR treatment arms (Fig. 4B), with a
non-significant trend when IGHV mutation status was added to a multivariable model in
addition to the treatment arm (1.3 [0.9-1.9], P=0.102).
Clonal evolution at disease relapse

Author Manuscript

To define clonal evolution in disease relapse, we performed WES on matched samples
collected at the time of relapse from 59 of 278 CLL8 subjects (Supplementary Tables 9 &
10). We observed large clonal shifts between pre-treatment and relapse samples in the
majority of cases (57 of 59), thus demonstrating that CLL evolution after therapy is the rule
rather than the exception (Fig. 5A). The relapse clone was already detectable in pretreatment WES in 18 of 59 (30%) cases, demonstrating that the study of pre-treatment
diversity anticipates the future evolutionary trajectories of the relapsed disease34. By
targeted deep sequencing, we detected relapse drivers in 11 of the 41 of pre-treatment
samples in which WES did not detect the relapse driver. In 7 of these 11 CLLs, at least one
relapse driver was detected in the pretreatment sample (Supplementary Table 10).

Author Manuscript

We further compared the pre-treatment and relapse CCF for each driver, and observed three
general patterns. First, tri(12), del(13q) and del(11q), suggested as early drivers (Fig. 3B),
tended to remain stably clonal despite marked, often branched, evolution (Fig. 5B [CLL
cases: GCLL-115, 307], Fig. 5C-top; Extended Data Fig. 10). This confirms that these are
indeed early events likely shared by the entire malignant population. Second, TP53
mutations and del(17p) demonstrated increases in CCF upon relapse, suggesting a fitness
advantage under therapeutic selection (Fig. 5B [GCLL-27, Fig. 5C-middle]). The novel
driver IKZF3 increased in CCF in 3 of 4 relapse cases (and remained clonal in the fourth),
supporting that these mutations likely enhance fitness. Third, mutations in SF3B1 and ATM,
identified as a temporally intermediate or late drivers, seemed just as likely to fall in CCF as
they were to rise (Fig. 5C-Bottom). These results suggest that within this therapeutic context
such mutations do not provide as strong of a fitness advantage as TP53 disruption. In
addition, we observed 9 instances each of multiple distinct alleles of ATM and SF3B1
mutations within the same CLL, (e.g., GCLL-307 in Fig. 5B), indicating convergent
evolution of these late-occurring CLL drivers.

Author Manuscript

This series also informs us regarding the mutagenesis of the tumor suppressor genes TP53
and ATM, where biallelic inactivation is common. In the case of ATM, we typically find a
fixed clonal del(11q22.3) and subclones harboring sSNVs affecting the other allele that shift
in CCF over time (e.g., GCLL -307). We confirmed that the breakpoints of sCNVs in
matched relapse and pre-treatment samples were highly consistent, likely representing the
same deletion event. These data thus suggest that mono-allelic ATM deletion provides a
fitness advantage that enables the expansion of the malignant population with subsequent
growth of multiple co-existing clones that harbor a second hit in the remaining allele. Thus
while a biallelic lesion is clearly selected for (Extended Data Fig. 6C), the longitudinal data
support the temporal analysis (Fig. 3B) in which del(11q) precedes ATM mutations,
reflecting the higher likelihood of a focal copy number loss compared with a deleterious
point mutation35,36. In contrast, we consistently observed a concordant rise of del(17p) and
TP53 mutations in all 12 CLLs harboring both of these events, and none of these cases

exhibited multiple shifting TP53 sSNVs/sINDELs. These observations suggest that a true
biallelic inactivation of TP53 is required, and indeed, across the 538 CLL samples, the odds
ratio for co-occurrence of del(17p) and TP53 mutation was far greater than the odds ratio for
co-occurrence of del(11q) and ATM mutation (97.22 vs. 10.99, respectively). These
observations are in agreement with a recent analysis that suggested that with the exception
of a few genes such as TP53, tumor suppressor genes in sporadic cancers are
haploinsufficient to begin with, and that the second hit only further builds on this fitness
advantage37.

CONCLUSIONS

Author Manuscript

This study of WES in CLL enabled a comprehensive identification of putative cancer genes
in CLL, generating novel hypotheses regarding the biology of this disease, and identifying
previously unrecognized putative CLL drivers such as RPS15 and IKZF3. The detailed
characterization of the compendium of driver lesions in cancer is of particular importance as
we strive to develop personalized medicine, as driver genes may inform prognosis (e.g.,
RPS15 mutations) and identify lesions that may be targeted by therapeutic intervention (e.g.,
MAPK pathway mutations and specifically the unexpected enrichment for non-canonical
BRAF mutations). Through the inclusion of samples collected within a landmark clinical
trial with mature outcome data, we could further study of the impact of genetic alterations in
the context of the current standard-of-care front line therapy. As targeted therapy is rapidly
transforming the treatment algorithms for CLL, future studies will be required to reexamine
these associations in this context38.

Author Manuscript

An important benefit of the larger cohort size is the enhanced ability to explore relationships
between driver lesions based on patterns of their co-occurrence. Focusing on temporal
patterns of driver acquisition – based on the distinction between clonal versus subclonal
alterations in a cross-sectional analysis – we derived a temporal map for the evolutionary
history of CLL. In the context of relapse after first-line fludarabine based therapy, we note
highly frequent clonal evolution, and that the future evolutionary trajectories were already
anticipated in the pre-treatment sample in one third of cases with WES.
This study provides a glimpse of some of the anticipated fruits of the application of novel
genomic technologies to growing cohort sizes across leukemias: the continued discovery of
novel candidate cancer genes, the deeper integration of genetic analysis with standardized
clinical information (collected within clinical trials) to inform prognosis and therapy, and the
ability to delineate the complex network of relationships between cancer drivers in the
history and progression of the malignant process.

Author Manuscript

A. Matched RNAseq and WES data were available for 156 CLLs (103 CLLs previously
reported in Landau et al.3 and 53 CLLs from the ICGC studies1). From the WES of these
156 cases, we identified 318 driver mutations (sSNVs and sINDELs). For each site, we
quantified the number of alternate reads corresponding to the somatic mutation in matched
RNAseq data. We subsequently counted the number of instances in which a mutation was
detected (‘detected’) and compared it to the number of instances in which mutation detection
had >90% power based on the allelic fraction in the WES and the read depth in the RNAseq
data (‘powered’). Overall, we detected 78.1% of putative CLL gene mutations at sites that
had >90% power for detection in RNAseq data B. Targeted orthogonal validation (Access
Array System, Fluidigm) was performed for 71 mutations (sSNVs and sINDELs) in putative
CLL genes, affecting 47 CLLs from the CLL8 cohort (selected based on sample
availability). With a mean depth of coverage of 7472X, 65 of the 71 mutations (91.55%)

The spectrum of mutation is shown for the clonal and subclonal subsets of coding somatic
sSNVs across WES of 538 samples. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of
trinucleotides with the specified sSNVs by the covered territory containing the specified
trinucleotide. Both clonal and subclonal sSNVs were similarly dominated by C>T
transitions at C*pG sites. Thus, this mutational process that was previously associated with
aging39, not only predates oncogenic transformation (since clonal mutations will be highly
enriched in mutations that precede the malignant transformation40), but also is the dominant
mechanism of malignant diversification after transformation in CLL.

For each CLL gene mutated across the 59 CLLs that were sampled longitudinally, the modal
CCF is compared between the pre-treatment and relapse samples. CCF increases (red),
decreases (blue) or stable (grey) over time are shown (in addition to CLL genes shown in
Figure 6). A significant change in CCF over time (red or blue) was determined if the 95%CI
of the CCF in the pre-treatment and relapse samples did not overlap.

Figure 1. The landscape of putative driver gene mutations and recurrent somatic copy number
variations in CLL

Somatic mutation information is shown across the 55 putative driver genes and recurrent
sCNVs (rows) for 538 primary patient samples (from CLL8 [green], Spanish ICGC [red],
DFCI/Broad [blue]) that underwent WES (columns). Blue labels- recurrent sCNVs; Bold
labels- putative CLL cancer genes previously identified in Landau et al.3); asterisked labelsadditional cancer genes identified in this study. Samples were annotated for IGHV status
(black-mutated; white-unmutated; red-unknown), and for exposure to therapy prior to

Figure 3. Inferred evolutionary history of CLL

A. The proportion in which a recurrent driver is found as clonal or subclonal across the 538
samples is provided (top), along with the individual cancer cell fraction (CCF) values for
each sample affected by a driver (tested for each driver with a Fisher's exact test, comparing
to the cumulative proportions of clonal and subclonal drivers excluding the driver evaluated).
Median CCF values are shown (bottom, bars represent the median and IQR for each driver).
B. Temporally direct edges are drawn when two drivers are found in the same sample, one in
clonal and the other in subclonal frequency. These edges are used to infer the temporal

that only driver pairs with at least 5 connecting edges were tested for statistical significance
and only drivers connected by at least one statistically significant edge are displayed (see
Methods, and Supplementary Tables 6 & 7).

A. Kaplan-Meier analysis (with logrank P values) for putative drivers with associated impact
on progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in the cohort of 278 patients that
were treated as part of the CLL8 trial. For candidate CLL genes tested here for the first time
regarding impact on outcome, a Bonferroni Q value is also shown. B. Presence of a
subclonal driver is associated with shorter PFS, in both the FC and FCR arms, and a trend
towards shorter OS.
