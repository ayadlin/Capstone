Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. While
some advances in lung cancer therapy have been made, patient survival is still quite poor. Two
microRNAs, miR-221 and miR-222, up-regulated by the MET proto-oncogene, have been already
described to enhance cell survival and to induce TRAIL resistance in NSCLC cell lines, through
the down-regulation of p27kip1, PTEN and TIMP3. Here we further investigated this pathway and
showed that miR-130a, expressed at low level in lung cancer cell lines, by targeting MET was able
to reduce TRAIL resistance in NSCLC cells through the c-Jun mediated downregulation of
miR-221 and miR-222. Moreover, we found that miR-130a reduced NSCLC migratory capacity.
A better understanding of MET-miR-221&222 axis regulation in drug resistance is the key in
developing new strategies in NSCLC therapy.

Introduction
NSCLC is the most frequent type of lung cancer and the most common cause of cancer
death. Poor survival of NSCLC cases is in part due to the development of drug resistance.
(Socinski et al., 2007). TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the
TNF family, known to induce apoptosis in a variety of different tumor types. Moreover,
TRAIL is able to specifically induce cell death in cancer cells while sparing normal cells,
and is currently tested as promising anti-tumor agent in clinical trials (Walczak et al., 1999).
Still many tumors, including NSCLC, are resistant to TRAIL and this limits its clinical
application (Schaefer et al., 2007). MiRNAs are small non coding RNAs of 19-25

nucleotides that can inhibit mRNA translation and/or negatively regulate its stability
(Ambros 2004). MiRNA dysregulation is one of the most important factors contributing to
cancer development (Croce 2009). Recently, evidence for a role for microRNA in
determining cancer drug resistance to therapy has emerged (Garofalo M et al., 2009;
Incoronato et al., 2010). Several miRNAs are indeed involved in drug resistance, such as
miR-15 and miR-16 that by targeting BCL-2 are involved in CLLs. (Cimmino et al., 2006),
miR-214 which by targeting PTEN, induce ovarian cancer progression (Yang et al., 2008)
and miR-221 and miR-222, which are markedly upregulated in TRAIL-resistant compared
to TRAIL-sensitive NSCLC cells (H460) (Garofalo M et al., 2009). In fact, miR-221 and
miR-222, whose expression is regulated by MET through AP1 (Garofalo et al., 2009),
modulate TRAIL sensitivity in lung cancer cells mainly by interfering with p27kip1, PTEN
and TIMP3 expression and TRAIL-induced caspase machinery (Garofalo et al., 2008;
Garofalo et al., 2009). MET is a membrane receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/
scatter factor (Birchmeier et al., 1998). MET tyrosine kinase and its cognate ligand
hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) are known to promote survival of many
cell types exposed to various apoptotic inducers, including serum starvation, death receptor
activation or genotoxic treatment (Tulasne et al., 2007). MET is normally expressed by cells
of epithelial origin and, upon HGF stimulation, stimulates the invasive growth of cancer
cells and increases their metastatic potential, principally through increased phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 and JNK (Song et al., 2006). Once activated JNKs phosphorylate the c-Jun
proto-oncoprotein, which is known to participate to the formation of the activator protein-1
(AP-1) transcription factor as a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Fos. (Derijard et al.,
1994). In NSCLC and HCC, MET regulates miR-221 and miR-222 levels and, accordingly,
cellular invasion and migration, through the c-Jun transcription factor and JNK activation
(Garofalo et al., 2009). In this study, we investigated the role of miR-130a in TRAIL
resistance and tumorigenesis of NSCLC, focusing on miR-221 and miR-222 regulation
induced by the MET oncogene.

miRNA-130a targets the MET protoncogene

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To better understand the role of miRNAs in drug-resistance of lung cancer cells, we
performed a bioinformatic search for putative miRNAs targeting MET. Among them,
miR-130a was a very good candidate since it has been reported to be downregulated in
NSCLC (Gao et al., 2010) and has a seed region that matches the 3′UTR of human MET
(nucleotides 4460-4467; NM_000245) (Fig. 1a). To verify whether MET was a direct target
of miR-130a, MET 3′ UTR, containing the miR-130a binding site, was cloned downstream
of the luciferase open reading frame. This reporter construct was used to transfect A549
cells together with miR-130a. Introduction of miR-130a in A549 cells with the wild-type 3′UTR construct had significant inhibition of luciferase activity as compared to the negative
control (fig 1c). As a control, increased expression of miR-130a in A549 cells was
confirmed by qRT PCR (fig. 1b). Also, mutation of the miR-130a binding site within the
MET 3′-UTR abolished the ability of miR-130a to regulate luciferase expression (fig 1a;1c).
Finally, enhanced expression of miR-130a in A549 cells strongly reduced MET endogenous
protein and mRNA levels in A549 cells, as compared to control cells transfected with
scrambled miRNA (fig. 1d and 1f). Increased expression of miR-130a in trasfected cells
(fig. 1d and 1f) was confirmed by qRT-PCR (fig 1e). Enhanced expression of miR-130a
strongly reduces MET endogenous protein also in others NSCLC cell lines as CALU-1,
H1299 and A459 (Supp. Fig. 1a; 1b; 1c). Increased expression of miR-130a in trasfected
NSCLC cell lines was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Suppl. Fig. 1d; 1e; 1f).

miRNA-130a downregulates miRNA 221/222 expression through AP1

Since the c-MET receptor is able to activate Akt and ERKs signaling (Peruzzi et al., 2006),
we analyzed Akt and ERK phosphorylation upon enhanced expression of miR-130a. As
shown in fig 2a, miR-130a overexpression decreased Akt and ERK1/2 posphorylation levels
in A549 lung cancer cells. The same effect was obtained by using a siRNA MET (Fig 2a).
Increased miR-130a expression levels were also confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2b). Akt and
ERK1/2 phosphorilation levels were also reduced in CALU-1 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines
by miR-130a overexpression (Suppl. Fig. 2a). The same effect was obtained using siRNA
MET (data not shown). Garofalo et al showed how MET is also implicated in miR-221 and
miR-222 trascriptional regulation (Garofalo et al., 2009). Indeed, c-MET activation by
growth factor is able to enhance miR-221 and miR-222 expression through JNK and AP1, in
particular c-Jun which directly binds an AP1 responsive element on miR-221 and miR-222
promoter region. In turn, miR-221 and miR-222 upregulation promotes apoptosis resistance
and stimulates cellular migration (Garofalo et al., 2009). Therefore, we decided to
investigate miR-130a ability to modulate the miR-221 and miR-222 expression levels
through AP1, by acting on MET expression. A Pgl3 basic construct carrying the AP1
responsive elements cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase coding region was used to test
our hypothesis. After 24, 48 and 72 hours of transfection of miR-130a in A549 cells, we
observed a progressive reduction of the luciferase activity of the AP1-luciferase vector, as
compared to the control (Fig 2c). Subsequent qRT-PCR showed that after 72 hr of
transfection, the endogenous levels of miR-221 and miR-222 decreased when miR-130a
expression increased, in A549 cells (Fig 2d). A decrease of miR-221 and miR-222
endogenous levels has been showed also in CALU-1, H1299 and A459 NSCLC cell lines
when miR-130a is overexpressed (Suppl. Fig. 1g, 1h and 1i). To support these data, we
examined whether miR-130a, by targeting MET, was able to decrease the amount of c-Jun
that binds the promoter region of the miR-221 and miR-222 cluster. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that the introduction of the miR-130a in
A549 cells resulted in the inhibition of c-Jun binding to the miR-221 and miR-222 promoter.
This inhibition was comparable to what obtained by MET silencing through siRNA (Fig. 2e
and 2f). A quantitative analysis of c-Jun binding to miR-221 and miR-222 promoter is
reported in Suppl. Fig. 2b. To further investigate whether AP1 is involved in miR-130a
suppression of miR-221 and miR-222, the effect of miR-130a expression on miR-221 and
miR-222 levels were assessed in A549 cells where c-Jun was silenced by c-Jun siRNA. In
Suppl. Fig. 2c we show that the discrepancy in percentage of miR-221 and miR-222
expression levels between scrambled miR and miR-130a in presence of siRNA c-Jun is less
than using siRNA scramble control, these data reinforce the evidence that miR-130a
mediated suppression on miR-221 and miR-222 levels acts trough AP1. We also performed
a western blot to show the reduced levels of MET and c-Jun when respectively miR-130a
and c-Jun siRNA were trasfected in A549 cells (Suppl. Fig. 2d). As a control, increased
expression of miR-130a in A549 cells was confirmed by qRT PCR (Suppl. Fig. 2e).
miRNA-130a activates apoptosis in NSCLC through miR221 and miR-222 downregulation
MET receptor is able to directly recruit PI3K through the two phosphorylated tyrosine
residues of the C-terminal multi-substrates docking site (Fan et al., 2004). The PI3K
pathway is involved in several biological responses mediated by MET activation, including
cell survival (Fan et al., 2007). We have previously shown that induction of miR-221 and
miR-222 expression by the MET oncogene and c-Jun transcription factor leads to resistance
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Garofalo et al., 2008). To test whether miR-130a
overexpression in resistant A549 cells leads to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through miR-221
and miR-222 down-regulation, cells were exposed to TRAIL for 40 minutes to induce cell
death and PARP activation was assessed by Western Blot. After introduction of miR-130a,
A549 cells resulted more sensitive to TRAIL death induction as shown by PARP activation

(Fig 3a). In these cells miR-221 enforced expression leaded to a partial restoration of the
TRAIL induced resistance (Fig 3a). MiR-130a and miR-221 ectopic expression levels were
investigated by qRT PCR (fig. 3b). Similar experiments have been performed also for
miR-222 (Suppl. Fig. 3a and 3b). To show that A549 TRAIL induced apoptosis is depending
on miR221 and miR-222, their endogenous expression levels were quantified by qRT-PCR.
As shown in fig 3c, miR-130a overexpression induced miR-221 and miR-222
downregulation also in A549 cells treated with TRAIL. A decrease of endogenous miR-221
and mir-222 expression levels in NSCLC cells resulted in increased TRAIL sensitivity
(Garofalo et al., 2009). To further confirm this data, we performed a proliferation assay in
A549 cell lines with low levels of miR-130a expression and high levels of miR-221 and
miR-222. Cells were exposed to TRAIL for 48h and, then cell proliferation was assessed by
using an MTT assay. Cells expressing high levels of miR-130a showed a very low
proliferation rate and underwent TRAIL-induced cell death, whereas cells overexpressing
high levels of miR-130a and miR-221 partially reacquired resistance when exposed to
soluble TRAIL (Fig 3d). An equal proliferation assay has been performed also in CALU-1,
H1299 and A459 NSCLC cell lines (Suppl. Fig. 3c, 3d and 3e). TRAIL resistant A549 cells
also became more sensitive to TRAIL induced apoptosis after miR130a overexpression as
determined by Annexin-FITC assay (Fig 3e) and caspase 3/7 activity (Fig 3f). To better
investigate the role of miR-130a in NSCLC a caspase 3/7 assay has also been performed in
CALU-1, H1299 and A459 cell lines (Suppl. Fig. 3f, 3g and 3h). To confirm miR-130a
overexpression and miR-221 and miR-222 levels a qRT PCR has been performed (Suppl.
Fig. 3i, 3l and 3m).Taken together these data show that NSCLC cell lines transfected with
pre-miR130a revealed a decrease of approximately 30%-50% in TRAIL resistance.
miRNA-130a modulates migration in NSCLC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several studies have shown that MET induces tumor cell migration and invasion through the
activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Segarra et al., 2006; Cecchi et al., 2010). To test the
effect of miR-130a on cellular migration, a “scratch” assays was performed. A549 cells were
first cultured in monolayer and then scratched after 48h of transfection. Interestingly,
miR-130a overexpression significantly inhibited A549 cell ability to migrate (Fig. 4a, 4b). In
the same cells, we observed decreased expression levels of miR-221 and miR-222 as
compared to the control (Fig. 4c). To support this finding, we also performed a transwell
migration assay. This experiment confirmed our previous data showing that A549 cells
overexpressing miR-130a had a lower capacity to migrate through the pores (Fig. 4 d and
4e ) and presented lower levels of miR-221 and 222 as compared to the control (Fig. 4 f). A
transwell migration assay has been performed also in CALU-1 cell line. (Suppl. Fig. 5a, 5b
and 5c). To better investigate the effect of miR-130a on migration in NSCLC a transwell
migration assay has been performed in A549 cells treated with a caspase inhibitor (zVAD).
We used a caspase inhibitor for this assay to make sure that the effect of miR-130a on
migration in A549 cells was not correlated with the induction of apoptosis due to miR-130a
overexpression. A549 cells were treated with (zVAD) 50μM for 48 hours and with DMSO
as control, then a transwell migration assay has beeen performed. As shown in Suppl. Fig.
4a and 4b the effect of miR-130a on A549 cells migration is not depending on caspase
activity cause the number of migrated cell treated with (zVAD) is comparable with his
control. We also shown that treatment with (zVAD) do not interfere with miR-130a
overexpression and also do not interfere with the effect that miR-130a has on miR-221 and
miR-222 expression levels (Suppl. Fig. 4c and 4d). To confirm the caspase inhibition in
A549 cells by (zVAD) a caspase 3/7 assay has been performed. (Suppl. Fig. 4e).

NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer cases and remains an incurable
disease (Ramalingam et al., 1998). One of the most important factors that affect survival rate
is resistance to therapeutic drugs. TRAIL is considered a powerful anticancer therapeutic
drug since it kills only the tumor cells without any cytotoxic effect to normal cells. (Wiley et
al., 1995; Mariani et al., 1997). Unfortunately, many human cancer cells remain resistant to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but the mechanism of such resistance is still not clear. Recently,
evidence of the role of microRNAs in drug sensitivity/resistance has been emerging.
Garofalo et al. identified 5 miRNAs up- or down-regulated in the TRAIL resistant compared
to the sensitive cell lines, and among them they found an upregulation of miR-221/222
(Garofalo et al., 2008). Moreover, our group recently reported that the activation of
miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 is regulated, at least in part, by the MET oncogene and c-Jun
transcription factor. (Garofalo et al., 2009). Here we have further investigated this pathway
and found that miR-130a was able to regulate miR-221 and miR-222 expression through
MET downregulation. MiRNA-130a has been found to be downregulated in various
chemoresistant tumor cells (Hummel et al., 2010; Sorrentino et al., 2008). MET receptor
promotes a complex biological program designated “invasive growth” that results from
stimulation of cell motility, invasion, and protection from apoptosis. Activation of MET
signaling is a frequent event observed in many types of cancers, including lung, and its
aberrant expression often correlates with poor prognosis in a variety of human malignancies.
Interestingly, by bioinformatic search we found that the 3′ UTR of human MET contained
regions that matched the seed sequence of miRNA 130a. By luciferase assays and Western
blots we confirmed MET as a direct target of miR-130a. We have previously shown that
MET conferred resistance to TRAIL-inducing apoptosis regulating miRNA-221 and
miRNA-222 levels (Garofalo et al., 2009) and for this reason we investigated the effects of
miR-130a on miR-221 and miR-222 expression. We found that miR-130a overexpression
was able to reduce the cellular levels of miR-221/222 by reducing MET expression levels.
Previously we showed how c-Jun, but not c-Fos was involved in miR-221 and miR-222
activation and that c-Jun had one binding site in the miR-221 and miR-222 promoter region.
On this basis we investigated, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, miRNA-130a ability to
reduce the binding of c-Jun to the miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 promoter region and we
found that miR-130a overexpression, as well MET downmodulation by siRNA, was able to
reduce drastically this interaction. In fact, the effect of this loss of binding resulted in a
downregulation of miR-221/222 expression. Since miR-221/222 have been found involved
in TRAIL resistance in NSCLC (Garofalo et al., 2009) we focused on the effect that the
miR-130a may have on TRAIL resistance in these cells. Thus we overexpressed miR-130a
in TRAIL resistant NSCLC cell lines and then we evaluated its effect on apoptosis after
TRAIL treatments. We found that miR-130a was able to increase TRAIL sensitivity in
NSCLC TRAIL resistant cell lines. This finding highlighted how miR-130a by targeting
MET, was able to reduce miR-221/222 expression and, accordingly, TRAIL resistance in
NSCLC cells. In fact, the data suggest that apoptosis induced by TRAIL in NSCLC cells is
at least in part, dependent on miR-130a expression. It has been reported that downregulation
of miR-221 and miR-222 resulted in a decrease of cell migration and invasion in both
Calu-1-lung derived and Snu-387 hepatocarcinoma cells (Garofalo et al., 2009). To
understand the role of miR-130a on cellular migration induced by miR-221/222 two
different migration assays were performed. MiR-130a overexpression in A549 and CALU-1
cells was able, by reducing miR-221/222 expression, to decrease the migratory abilities of
cells and we also shown how this effect is not dependent on apoptosis. Taken together the
results suggested that miRNA-130a was able to modulate miRNA-221 and miRNA-222
expression by targeting MET, and this effect resulted on an improved TRAIL sensitivity and
a decrease of cell migration in A549 cells. Thus, targeting MET and modulating

Transwell Migration Assay
A549 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum to ~60% confluence
and transfected with 100 nM miR-130a, miR-221 precursor molecule or a negative control.
After 48 h, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed once with Hanks’
balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). To measure cell migration, 8-nm pore size culture inserts
(Transwell; Costar, High Wycombe, UK) were placed into the wells of 24-well culture
plates, separating the upper and the lower chambers. In the lower chamber, 400 μl of RPMI
10% fetal bovine serum was added. Then, 1 × 105 cells were added to the upper chamber.
After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the number of cells that had migrated

Confluent A549s (passage <7) were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) with
miR-130a, miR-221 or control oligonucleotides. At 48 hr after transfection, a cell scratch
spatula was used to make a scratch in the cell monolayer after which the cell monolayers
were rinsed and further incubated. Pictures of the scratches were taken by using a digital
camera system coupled to a microscope. The cells were incubated for 8 and 24 hr and
pictures of the scratches were taken by using a digital camera system coupled to a
microscope (Zeiss) using a x4 objective. To determine the migration distance (μm) we used

Briefly, A549 cells were transfected with negative control miR, miR-130a, negative control
siRNA or MET-siRNA, and, 48 h after the transfection, cells were fixed in 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°, washed with ice cold 1X PBS, scraped in 1X PBS plus
protease inhibitors and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis
buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) plus protease inhibitors and sonicated. Chromatin was
immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz) or normal rabbit IgG as
negative control. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed following the manufacturer’s

Cells were plated in 96-well plates in triplicate and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
incubator. Super-Killer TRAIL (Alexis Biochemicals) was used for 24-48 h at 400 ng ml−1.
Cells viability was examined with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dipheniltetrazolium
bromide (MTT)-Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega),
according to the manifacturer’s protocol. Metabolically active cells were detected by adding
20 μl to each well. After 1h of incubation, the plates were analyzed in a Multilabel Counter
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin VFITC apoptosis detection kits followed by flow cytometric analysis and caspase 3/7 activity.
Cells were seeded at 1.8×106cells per 100mm dish, grown overnight in 10% FBS/RPMI,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then treated for 3h with 400 ng/ml
TRAIL. Following incubation, cells were washed with cold PBS and removed from the
plates by trypsinization. The resuspended cells were washed with cold PBS and stained with
FITC-conjugated annexin V antibody according to the manifacturer’s instructions (Roche
Applied Science, South San Francisco, CA, USA). Cells (5×105 per sample) were then
subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry analyses were done as described
(Garofalo et al., 2007). The fraction of A549 cells treated with TRAIL was taken as the
apoptotic cell population. The percentage of apoptosis indicated was corrected for
background levels found in the corresponding untreated controls. For detection of caspase
3/7 activity, cells were cultured in 96-well plates and treated with TRAIL 400 ng/ml and
analyzed using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The percentage of caspase activity was corrected for backgrounds levels found
in the corresponding untreated controls.
qRT PCR
Real-time PCR was performed using a standard TaqMan PCR Kit protocol on an Applied
Biosystem 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The 10 μl PCR
reaction included 0.67 μl RT product, 1 μl TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems), 0.2 mM TaqMan probe, 1.5 mM forward primer and 0.7 mM reverse primer,
The reactions were incubated in a 96-well plate at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95 °C for 15 sec. and 60 °C for 1 min. All reactions run in triplicate. The threshold cycle
(CT) is defined as the freactional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed
threshold. The comparative CT method for relative quantization of gene expression (Applied

Biosistems) was used to determine miRNA expression levels. The y axis represents the
2 (−ΔCT), or the relative expression of different miRs. MiRs expression was calculated
relative to U44 and U48 rRNA and multipled by 104. Experiments were carried out in
triplicate for each data point, and data analysis was performed by using software (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean values±standard deviation (s.d.). The Student’s
t-test was used to determine the role of miRs, expression on NSCLC cells in few
experiments. P<0.05 was considered significant.
