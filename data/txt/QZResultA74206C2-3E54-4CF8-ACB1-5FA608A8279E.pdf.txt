Abstract
Whereas the tumor suppressor p53 gene is frequently mutated
in most human cancers, this is not the case in human
papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers, presumably because the viral E6 oncoprotein inactivates the p53 protein.
The ability of E6 to transform cells in tissue culture and
induce cancers in mice correlates in part with its ability to
inactivate p53. In this study, we compared the expression of
the HPV16 E6 oncogene to the conditional genetic disruption
of p53 in the context of a mouse model for cervical cancer in
which estrogen is a critical cofactor. Nearly all of the
K14Crep53f/f mice treated with estrogen developed cervical
cancer, a stark contrast to its complete absence in like-treated
K14E6WTp53f/f mice, indicating that HPV16 E6 must only
partially inactivate p53. p53-independent activities of E6
also contributed to carcinogenesis, but in the female reproductive tract, these activities were manifested only in the
presence of the HPV16 E7 oncogene. Interestingly, treatment
of K14Crep53f/f mice with estrogen also resulted in mammary
tumors after only a short latency, many of which were positive
for estrogen receptor A. The majority of these mammary
tumors were of mixed cell types, suggestive of their originating
from a multipotent progenitor. Furthermore, a subset of
mammary tumors arising in the estrogen-treated, p53deficient mammary glands exhibited evidence of an epithelial
to mesenchymal transition. These data show the importance
of the synergy between estrogen and p53 insufficiency in
determining basic properties of carcinogenesis in hormoneresponsive tissues, such as the breast and the reproductive
tract. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2622–31]

Introduction
Infection with ‘‘high-risk’’ mucosal-tropic or human papillomaviruses (HPV) is etiologically associated with the development of
several human cancers, including cervical cancer (1), the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide
(2). HPV16, one of the dozen or so high-risk HPVs, is associated
with more than half of all cases of HPV-related cervical cancer (3).
Two HPV genes, E6 and E7, are consistently up-regulated in human
cervical cancers upon integration of the viral genome into the host
chromosome (4, 5). High-risk HPV E6 and E7 are considered potent
oncogenes based on their transforming (6) and immortalizing (7)

activities in tissue culture systems and their capacities to induce
tumors in various animal models (8–11).
High-risk HPV E6 and E7 are multifunctional proteins and are
best known for their abilities to bind and inactivate p53 (12, 13)
and pRb (14, 15), respectively. We previously investigated the
functional contributions of both E6 and E7 in cervical cancer in
transgenic mice, which express these genes either individually or in
combination. These studies made use of K14E6WT and K14E7WT
transgenic mice in which the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes were
directed in their expression from the human keratin 14 (K14)
promoter, which is specifically active in the basal compartment
of stratified epithelia including that of the cervix. Treatment of
K14E6WT and K14E6WTE7WT transgenic mice with exogenous
estrogen resulted in cervical cancer after 6 months of treatment
with estrogen (16). None of the K14E6WT transgenic mice, however,
developed high-grade lesions or cancers unless the treatment
period was extended to 9 months (17). The ability of E6 to
inactivate p53 is thought to be an important contributing factor in
cervical carcinogenesis. Consistent with this premise, K14E6I128T
transgenic mice, which express a mutant form of the E6 protein
hindered in degrading p53 (18, 19), had fewer and smaller cervical
cancers (17). This mutant form of E6, however, is also deficient in
other activities, including the ability to bind cellular partners
that recognize E6 through leucine-rich motifs, including E6AP and
E6BP (19). Because p53 is an important tumor suppressor and
presumably an important target of E6, it was of interest to
investigate further the specific contribution of p53 in cervical
cancer.
To determine the role of p53 in cervical carcinogenesis, we
treated mice with estrogen for 6 months that had both alleles of
p53 conditionally deleted via the Cre-lox system in all stratified
epithelia, including the epithelia lining the reproductive tract by
using Cre driven by the K14 promoter (K14Cre). We made use of
conditional p53-null (Crep53f/f ) mice, as mice homozygous for a
germ-line deletion of p53 succumb to lymphomas and sarcomas
early in life (20) and therefore were not predicted to survive the
6 months of treatment with exogenous estrogen, a required cofactor
for cervical cancer in HPV transgenic mice (16, 21). Moreover, use of
K14Crep53f/f mice permitted us to determine the importance of
p53 inactivation specifically in the relevant epithelial cell type in
which HPV infections and associated cancers arise and eliminate
any potential influence that inactivation of p53 in the stroma might
confer. Finally, the conditional p53 mouse model allowed us
to investigate the contributions of p53-dependent and p53independent activities of HPV E6 in tumorigenesis and whether
these activities synergize with those of HPV E7.
Conditional loss of p53 in stratified epithelia led to the efficient
induction of cervical cancer when K14Crep53f/f mice were treated
with estrogen for 6 months. HPV E6 must not completely inactivate
p53 because K14E6WT (16) or K14E6WTp53f/f (this study) mice did
not develop cervical cancers when only treated with estrogen for
6 months. K14Crep53f/f mice developed nonreproductive tumors in

the absence of estrogen. These tumors consisted primarily of
squamous cell carcinomas and mammary tumors, similar to those
found in previous studies that did not include treatment with
exogenous estrogen (22–24). Interestingly, mammary tumors
developed with a shortened latency in K14Crep53f/f mice treated
with estrogen, were of mixed cell types, and were estrogen receptor
a (ERa) positive. These observations suggest that estrogen and the
loss of p53 synergize to result in early-onset tumors that are
dependent on estrogen and may arise from multipotent progenitor
cells in the mammary gland. Furthermore, a subset of the
mammary tumors arising in the K14Crep53f/f mice treated with
estrogen exhibited signs indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT), including loss of E-cadherin and the expression
of vimentin (25, 26). Addition of HPV E6 and/or E7 onto the
K14Crep53f/f background significantly shortened tumor latency and
increased tumor multiplicity in both nonreproductive and
reproductive sites, indicating that p53-independent effects of E6
act together with or in some tissue contexts independently of HPV
E7 to increase its oncogenic potential.

Materials and Methods
Mouse lines. The previously described p53f/f (27), K14Cre (23), K14E6WT
(11), K14E6D146-151 (K14E6D herein; ref. 28), and K14E7WT (8) mouse strains
were maintained on the inbred FVB background. K14Cre mice were crossed
to p53f/f mice to generate K14Crep53f/f mice in which p53 is deleted by Cremediated excision in the basal layer of stratified epithelia. K14E6WT, K14E6D ,
and K14E7WT transgenic mice were crossed to p53f/f and then intercrossed
with K14Crep53f/f mice to generate K14E6p53f/f, K14E6Dp53f/f, K14E7WTp53f/f,
K14E6WTE7WTp53f/f, K14E6WTCrep53f/f, K14E6DCrep53f/f, K14E7WTCrep53f/f ,
and K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice. All mice were bred and maintained in
the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–
approved McArdle Laboratory Animal Care Facility in accordance with an
institutionally approved animal protocol.
Estrogen treatment and analysis of reproductive tracts. For acute
studies, 5- to 6-wk-old virgin female mice were treated with 17h-estradiol
(0.05 mg, 60-d release pellets) for 6 wk to achieve a state of persistent estrus
(29) to eliminate variability in the thickness of the reproductive epithelia.
The mice were then either exposed to 12 Gy of ionizing radiation from
a 137Cs source or untreated and sacrificed 24 h later. One hour
before sacrifice, the nucleotide analogue 5-bromo-2¶-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd;
12.5 mg/mL in PBS) was injected i.p. at 10 AL/g body weight to label any
newly synthesized DNA.
For long-term cancer studies, 5-wk-old virgin female mice were either
untreated or treated with 17h-estradiol (0.05 mg, 60-d release pellets) for a
period of 6 mo, after which the reproductive tracts were harvested and fixed
according to previously described methods (16) and sectioned. Every tenth,
5-Am section was stained with H&E and evaluated histopathologically, with
the worst lesion scored as the final diagnosis.
Quantification of DNA synthesis and DNA damage response. To
quantify the levels of DNA synthesis in the epithelium of the cervix, basal
and suprabasal BrdUrd-positive cells were counted and divided by the total
number of cells and multiplied by 100 to determine the percentage. To
quantify the DNA damage response, the total number of BrdUrd-positive
cells was counted and divided by the total number of cells in the epidermis
and multiplied by 100. BrdUrd was counted in ten 40 microscopic fields
per mouse, with a total of at least three or more mice per genotype group.
Statistical analysis. The MSTAT software program1 was used in
determining statistical significance. A two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test
was used for determining statistical significance in the quantification of
DNA synthesis, tumor multiplicity, and tumor area. A two-sided Fisher’s

exact test was used in determining significance for cancer incidence,
whereas the log-rank test was used for Kaplan-Meier analyses.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were carried out as previously
described (16, 17) and described further in Supplementary Methods.

Results
p53 is efficiently deleted in the epithelium of the reproductive
tract in K14Crep53f/f mice. The primary goal of this study was to
determine whether inactivation of p53 in the presence of exogenous
estrogen is sufficient for the induction of cervical cancer. Early
development of lymphomas and other tumors in germ-line p53-null
mice (20) makes it impossible to use these mice in long-term
experiments. Thus, we obtained p53f/f mice that are homozygous for
alleles of p53 in which loxP sites were inserted into introns 1 and 10
(27) and mated to ones that express Cre driven by the human K14
promoter (K14Cre; ref. 23). Cre mediates the excision of sequences
flanked by the inverted loxP sites, resulting in a frameshift within the
spliced transcript arising from the p53f/f allele. This frameshift
produces a short unstable gene product that is undetectable in all
K14Cre-expressing tissues (23).
To determine whether p53 was efficiently deleted in the
epithelium of the reproductive tract in K14Crep53f/f mice, we tested
whether these mice (treated with exogenous estrogen to induce
persistent estrus and thereby eliminate variability in proliferative
indices due to estrus/diestrus cycling) lacked the ability to mount a
DNA damage response, an activity that requires p53 (30). To induce a
DNA damage response, mice were either not treated or treated with
ionizing radiation and sacrificed 24 h later. One hour before sacrifice,
the mice were injected with the nucleotide analogue BrdUrd to label
any newly synthesized DNA. The levels of p53 and BrdUrd were
assessed by performing immunohistochemistry on reproductive
tissue sections. p53 was not detected in the cervical epithelium of
K14Crep53f/f mice in contrast to p53f/f mice on irradiation, indicating
that p53 was deleted in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Furthermore, cervical cancers obtained from K14Crep53f/f mice did
not express p53 (data not shown). The number of BrdUrd-positive
cells was quantified (Supplementary Fig. S1B; Fig. 1A, left).
DNA synthesis was reduced upon DNA damage in p53f/f mice
(1.5% unirradiated versus 0.13% irradiated; P = 0.02), whereas in
K14Crep53f/f mice the levels of DNA synthesis remained similar to
that in unirradiated mice (2.9% unirradiated versus 2.1% irradiated;
P = 0.28). These data provide functional proof that p53 was efficiently
deleted in the cervical epithelia of the K14Crep53f/f mice.
Deletion of p53 in the epithelium of the cervix results in an
increase in the levels of DNA synthesis. As evident from the data
presented above, the overall frequency of BrdUrd-positive cervical
epithelial cells in unirradiated K14Crep53f/f mice (2.9%) compared
with unirradiated p53f/f mice (1.5%) was increased by f2-fold. This
difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03). To characterize
further the nature of the epithelial hyperplasia in K14Crep53f/f
mice, the frequency of BrdUrd-positive cells within the basal
versus suprabasal compartments of the cervical epithelium of
K14Crep53f/f and p53f/f mice was compared (Fig. 1A, right).
K14Crep53f/f mice treated with estrogen had a marginal increase
in the levels of DNA synthesis in the basal layer relative to p53f/f
mice (11.6% versus 5.6%, respectively; P = 0.07). The levels of
suprabasal DNA synthesis, on the contrary, were significantly
increased in K14Crep53f/f relative to p53f/f mice (0.8% versus 0.3%,
respectively; P = 0.03). Thus, the epithelial hyperplasia that arose
in the cervix of K14Crep53f/f mice is manifested in both

Role of p53 and Estrogen in Breast and Cervical Cancers

for 6 months to determine whether deletion of p53 contributes to
cervical carcinogenesis. Reproductive tracts from these mice were
histopathologically analyzed to identify the worst stage of disease
present by using a previously established grading system (16).
Similar to previous findings, none of the untreated mice irrespective
of the genotype developed cervical cancer (data not shown), even in
the absence of p53. These results reiterate the observation
that estrogen is a necessary cofactor in this mouse model of
cervical cancer (21). As expected, none of the p53-sufficient, p53f/f
mice developed high-grade lesions or cancers after 6 months of
treatment with estrogen. In contrast, nearly all of the estrogentreated K14Crep53f/f mice developed cervical cancer (88%; Fig. 1B;
Table 1), which is highly significant compared with estrogen-treated
p53f/f mice (P < 4  105). Thus, the loss of p53 in the reproductive
epithelium in combination with estrogen is sufficient for the
induction of cervical cancer. Similar results were observed when
we analyzed the lower reproductive tract for the incidence of vaginal
intraepithelial neoplasia and cancers. Specifically, K14Crep53f/f mice
had high-grade lesions and cancers (Supplementary Tables S1
and S2) in the lower reproductive tract; however, compared with
the cervix, these lesions were much less frequent.
The high penetrance of cervical cancer in K14Crep53f/f mice is in
sharp contrast to K14E6WTp53f/f mice, which did not develop any
cancers in the reproductive tract after treatment with estrogen for
6 months (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). The latter result is
consistent with prior studies in which K14E6WT mice on p53WT/WT
background also failed to develop cervical cancers after treatment
with estrogen for 6 months (16). Furthermore, the incidence of
cervical cancer in K14E6WT mice was only partially penetrant (41%)
when treatment with estrogen was extended to 9 months (17). The
weaker oncogenic potential observed in K14E6WT mice compared
with K14Crep53f/f mice suggests that HPV16 E6 is only partially
inactivating p53.
HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes synergize with the deletion of p53
to shorten tumor latency. Although conditional deletion of p53 in

stratified epithelia extended the life span of these mice compared
with that of germ-line p53-null mice, the absence of this important
tumor suppressor in other epithelial tissues resulted in the
development of nonreproductive tumors that contributed to
early-onset morbidity/mortality (see below and Discussion). In
particular, K14E7WT and K14E6WTE7WT transgenic mice on the
K14Crep53f/f background were highly susceptible to early-onset
morbidity/mortality aside from expected problems of bladder
distension (a phenotype induced by exogenous estrogen; refs. 9, 29)
and thymic hyperplasia due to the expression of E7 (8). A subset
of the K14E7WTCrep53f/f and K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice consequently died or had to be sacrificed prematurely after only 3.5 to
4 months of treatment with estrogen due to the added tumor
burden in addition to the aforementioned problems. Reproductive
tracts were harvested at the time of sacrifice and histologic
examination revealed that 75% of K14E7WTCrep53f/f and 100% of
K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice had already developed cervical cancers
that were quite aggressive as evidenced by the large areas of
invasion. This aggressive cancer phenotype worsened with
increasing duration of treatment with estrogen (Fig. 1C and D).
This led us to investigate whether cancer was also developing
in K14Crep53f/f and K14E6WTCrep53f/f mice during this time
frame. Therefore, mice from these two genotypes were specifically
sacrificed at 4 months and histopathologically examined (Fig. 1C).
None of the K14Crep53f/f mice sacrificed at 4 months had
developed cancer, which is significantly different than K14E7WT
Crep53f/f mice (P = 0.007). One K14E6WTCrep53f/f mouse did
develop a small microinvasive cancer (MIC) in the lower
reproductive tract. These results suggest that the HPV oncogene
E7, and to a lesser extent E6, can shorten tumor latency in the
cervix in the absence of p53.
Loss of p53 results in the development of nonreproductive
tumors in the skin and mammary glands, the latter with
phenotypes of EMT. A previous study showed that conditional
deletion of p53 in the basal layer of the epithelium was sufficient

for the development of spontaneous tumors, such as fibrosarcomas
and squamous cell carcinomas, in the skin (23). We monitored
various mice over a 15-month period for the development of
spontaneous tumors and observed a similar spectrum of nonreproductive tumors in our study (Fig. 2A). In addition, we observed

the development of two possible cases of ‘‘collision’’ tumors, which
are rare occurrences when two or more histologically distinct
neoplasms develop adjacent to one another. To look for potential
gene dosage effects on tumorigenesis and latency, we monitored
mice containing one or both copies of the p53 gene disrupted. As

p53 (K14Crep53f/f ) decreases the median tumor-free survival from 14 to 10.5 mo (P = 106). ii, comparison of genotypes from the previous graph plus K14E6WTp53f/f
(blue ), K14E6WTCrep53f/+ (brown ; T 50 = 14 mo), and K14E6WTCrep53f/f (orange; T 50 = 8 mo). Again, deletion of both alleles of p53 significantly shortens
tumor latency in the presence of HPV E6 (K14E6WTCrep53f/f versus K14E6WTCrep53f/+ ; P = 1.24  108). iii, additional comparison of K14E6Dp53f/f (gray),

K14E6WTCrep53f/f (orange ; T 50 = 8 mo) relative to K14Crep53f/f (green ; T 50 = 10.5 mo; P = 4  108). Loss of PDZ interactions in K14E6DCrep53f/f does not result
in a shortened latency (turquoise ; T 50 = 11 mo) as in K14E6WTCrep53f/f (orange ; T 50 = 8 mo; P = 0.0003) and is similar to K14Crep53f/f mice (P = 0.82). iv, comparison

with loss of p53 to shorten tumor latency in K14E7WTCrep53f/f compared with K14E7WTp53f/f (T 50 = 5.5 mo; P = 5  109).

expected, we observed an overall increase in cancer incidence
(Fig. 2A) and shorter tumor latency (P = 106; Fig. 2B, i) when both
alleles of p53 were deleted. There was a highly significant reduction
in median tumor latency in K14Crep53f/f mice relative to p53f/f
mice (Fig. 2B, i), where the latter did not develop any tumors by
the end point (median tumor latency, T 50 = 10.5 versus >15 months;
P < 1024).
Other studies have shown that spontaneous mammary carcinomas develop when BRCA2 (23) or BRCA1 (24) is conditionally
deleted in combination with p53, with a median latency of 10
and 7.5 months, respectively. We also observed the development of
mammary tumors in females on the K14Crep53f/+ and K14Crep53f/f
background, without concomitant deletion of BRCA. Interestingly,
mammary tumors developed more quickly in mice treated with
exogenous estrogen, appearing as early as 3 to 4 months. These
tumors were large and aggressive as surgical removal of the
tumor(s) provided a minor reprieve of f2 weeks before a quick
resurgence of growth. Furthermore, treatment with estrogen
resulted in tumors that were often ERa positive (Fig. 3B), in
contrast to tumors obtained in the absence of exogenous estrogen
(24). In the absence of exogenous estrogen, the breeding or
virgin females displayed a longer tumor latency (data not shown).
Various histologic types of mammary tumors (adenocarcinomas,
myoepithelial carcinomas, and spindle cell carcinomas; data not
shown) were observed in estrogen-treated mice on the K14Crep53f/f

background, many of which differentially expressed markers
of both myoepithelial (K14) and luminal (keratin 8) cell types
(Fig. 3A).
In addition to a shortened latency, a subset of mammary tumors
arising in the estrogen-treated mice displayed spindle cell type
morphology or contained mixtures of both epithelial and
mesenchymal cell types. We were therefore curious to determine
whether there was an occurrence of EMT in these tumors. In the
course of EMT, expression of E-cadherin is often reduced, and
N-cadherin increased (25). Thus, the expression of both N-cadherin
and E-cadherin was evaluated by immunofluorescence. The
majority of these tumors expressed both N-cadherin and Ecadherin; however, a subset of these tumors irrespective of the
presence of either HPV E6 or E7 displayed a loss of E-cadherin.
These tumors also expressed vimentin, an intermediate filament
marker up-regulated in EMT (Fig. 3C and D; ref. 26).
Cervical cancers arising in p53 conditionally deficient mice
display alterations in the p16/pRb pathway. The cyclin kinase
inhibitor p16 has been established as a marker for high-risk HPVpositive infection in dysplastic lesions and cancers in the
reproductive tract in both humans (31) and mice (17). Moreover,
HPV E7 accounts for most of the induction of p16, as tumors
from K14E6WT transgenic mice express reduced levels of p16 and
exhibit an inverse staining pattern compared with tumors arising
in K14E7WT mice (17). The ‘‘E7’’ staining pattern, however, was

regained when the ability of E6 to degrade p53 was hindered in
K14E6I128T mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that cervical cancers
arising in K14Crep53f/f mice would express low levels of p16.
Immunohistochemistry for p16 was performed on tumors from
mice on the K14Crep53f/f background in the presence or absence
of E6 and E7. Unexpectedly, tumors from K14Crep53f/f mice
predominantly overexpressed p16 (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S3),
a result opposite to that observed in tumors from K14E6WT mice
(17). A small subset of K14Crep53f/f tumors, however, expressed
lower amounts of p16, resembling more the pattern observed in
K14E6WT mice (data not shown). Tumors from K14E6WTCrep53f/f
and K14Crep53f/f mice had similar levels of p16, suggesting
that deletion of p53 is dominant with regard to the induction
of p16. As expected, tumors from K14E7 WT Crep53 f/f and
K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice expressed robust levels of p16 presumably due to the presence of HPV E7.
We and others have shown that the levels of p16 and pRb are
inversely correlated in both tumors and tissue culture (32, 33).
Thus, immunohistochemistry for pRb was also performed to
determine if the inverse correlation with p16 is maintained in
tumors without p53 (Fig. 4). pRb was low but detectable in tumors
from K14Crep53f/f and K14E6WTCrep53f/f mice. Consistent with the
ability of E7 to inactivate and degrade pRb, the levels of pRb
were decreased further or undetectable in tumors from K14E7WT
Crep53f/f and K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice. These results suggest
that the inverse relationship between p16 and pRb is maintained in
tumors without p53.
Bmi-1 has been reported to regulate p16 through targeting of the
INK4a locus (34). Bmi-1 is overexpressed in many different cancers
(35, 36) and can immortalize certain epithelial cells when expressed
exogenously (37). We performed immunohistochemistry to assess
the status of Bmi-1 in cervical tumors (Fig. 4). Tumors from

K14Crep53f/f, K14E6WTCrep53f/f, K14E7WTCrep53f/f , and K14E6WT
E7WTCrep53f/f mice all expressed Bmi-1. Bmi-1 was inversely
correlated with the expression of p16 in K14Crep53f/f and K14E6WT
Crep53f/f tumors. In the presence of E7 (K14E7WTCrep53f/f and
K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f ), the levels of Bmi-1 were increased further
but primarily retained an inverse relationship with p16.
The E2F-responsive gene MCM7 has also been established as a
biomarker for dysplastic lesions and cancers positive for high-risk
HPV infections (38). Induction of MCM7 likely occurs in part
through the ability of E7 to target pRb for degradation, resulting in
an up-regulation of E2F target genes. HPV E6 can also dysregulate
the pRb pathway (39), in a manner distinct from HPV E7, leading to
the up-regulation of expression of E2F target genes, such as MCM7
(17). We assessed the status of MCM7 by immunohistochemistry
on tumors from this study (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S3). The
majority of tumors from K14Crep53f/f mice expressed intermediate
to high levels of MCM7, consistent with the pattern observed in
cervical tumors from K14E6WT mice (17). We hypothesized that the
ability of E6 to hyperphosphorylate pRb (39) results in the upregulation of the E2F-responsive gene MCM7. To determine
whether E6 can hyperphosphorylate pRb in the tumors that arise
in our mice, immunohistochemistry was performed with an
antibody recognizing phosphorylated pRb specifically at Ser807
and Ser811, two sites that when phosphorylated can disrupt the
binding of E2F to pRb (40). Tumors from both K14Crep53f/f and
K14E6WTCrep53f/f expressed phosphorylated pRb, suggesting that
the inactivation of pRb by phosphorylation drives the up-regulation
of E2F target genes, such as MCM7, in these tumors in the
absence of E7. K14E6WTCrep53f/f tumors expressed a modest
qualitative increase in the levels of phosphorylated pRb relative to
K14Crep53f/f tumors. This increase suggests that the ability of E6
to hyperphosphorylate pRb is in part independent of its ability to

mice have low expression of Bmi-1, pRb, and phospho-Rb, whereas expression of p16 and MCM7 was higher. Both tumors from K14E7WTCrep53f/f and
K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice have similar expression patterns, such that Bmi-1, p16, and MCM7 were high and expression of pRb and phospho-Rb was low
(more detailed description in Supplementary Table S3).

inactivate p53, consistent with previous findings (39). In the
presence of E7, almost all of the pRb is degraded and only
occasional pRb and phosphorylated pRb-positive cells were
detected (Fig. 4).

Discussion
In this study, we compared the oncogenic potential of the HPV16
E6 oncogene to the genetic disruption of the tumor suppressor
p53 in the context of a mouse model for cervical carcinogenesis
that relies on treatment with exogenous estrogen. Conditional
deletion of p53 was sufficient for the induction of reproductive
(cervical and vaginal) cancers only in the presence of estrogen and
the addition of HPV E6 and E7 shortened tumor latency and
produced more aggressive tumors. In the course of this study,
we also discovered that estrogen and the loss of p53 synergized to
induce early onset of mammary tumors. These mammary tumors
are ERa positive, composed of mixed cell types, thus suggestive
of a multipotent progenitor and displayed evidence of EMT. Below,
we discuss the implications of our studies in the context of
understanding cervical carcinogenesis associated with HPVs as
well as mammary tumorigenesis.
HPV E6 does not completely inactivate p53. We have
previously shown that K14E6WT transgenic mice treated with
exogenous estrogen do not succumb to the development of highgrade lesions or cancers unless the estrogen treatment period was
extended from 6 to 9 months (17). In contrast, K14E7WT transgenic
mice efficiently developed cancer after only 6 months of treatment
with estrogen, suggesting that HPV E6 has a weaker oncogenic
potential in the reproductive tract (16). These results are in stark
contrast to previous observations in the epidermis of the skin,
where E6 was more potent relative to E7 (10). Similar findings were
observed in this study. None of the K14E6WTp53f/f mice developed
high-grade lesions or cancers after 6 months of treatment
with estrogen. Treatment of K14Crep53f/f mice with estrogen,
however, resulted in a wide spectrum of high-grade lesions,
including cancers in both the cervix (Table 1) and the lower
reproductive tract (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Furthermore, the incidence of large invasive cancer (LIC) in the cervix
of K14E7 W T Crep53 f/f mice (57.1%) was higher than in
K14E6WTE7WTp53f/f mice (33%). Whereas this increase was not
highly significant (P = 0.40), the increase in LIC in the lower
reproductive tract of K14E7WTCrep53f/f mice (57.1%) compared
with K14E6WTE7WTp53f/f mice (11%) was statistically significant
(P = 0.04). These results not only suggest that the conditional
inactivation of p53 in the reproductive epithelium is sufficient to
give rise to cancer in concert with exogenous estrogen but also
support the hypothesis that HPV E6 is not completely inactivating
p53 in the reproductive tract.
Similar observations were drawn from monitoring the development of nonreproductive tumors. K14E6WTp53f/f mice were
significantly less tumor prone as evidenced by a reduced hazard
ratio (0.17), cancer incidence (25.6%), and tumor multiplicity (0.3)
compared with that observed in K14Crep53f/f mice (all P < 0.0001;
Table 2). Thus, HPV E6 is incompletely inactivating p53 at all
evaluated tissue sites. The analysis of human cervical cancers has
led to the same conclusion in that some human cervical cancers
still express detectable p53 protein, indicative of E6 not completely
degrading it (41, 42). Thus, our mouse model for cervical cancer
recapitulates a feature of human cervical cancer in that p53 is not
completely inactivated by E6.

Differences in the oncogenic potential of E6 among
epithelial tissues. Whereas E6 (K14E6WTp53f/f ) did induce
nonreproductive tumors (Table 2), it failed to induce any
reproductive tumors (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). This
indicates that E6 has stronger oncogenic potential in nonreproductive sites. Tumor development in nonreproductive sites, in part,
may require a lower threshold of inactive p53. Alternatively, p53independent activities of E6 may be more influential for tumor
development in nonreproductive sites compared with that in the
reproductive tract. The latter possibility is supported by the earlier
onset of tumors in nonreproductive sites in K14E6WTCrep53f/f
compared with that in K14Crep53f/f mice (Fig. 2B, ii).
The E7 oncogene synergizes with the loss of p53 to induce
cancer. p53 is regarded as the ‘‘guardian of the genome’’ (43)
because it mediates the response of DNA damage and other stress
response pathways. Our studies herein show that the deletion of
p53 is sufficient to cause the induction of LICs of the
reproductive tract in the presence of exogenous estrogen. Prior
studies of HPV transgenic mice, however, determined that
induction of LIC in the reproductive tract was highest when
both HPV E6 and E7 were expressed (16). Thus, we investigated
whether placement of HPV E7 onto the K14Crep53f/f background
led to a further increase in LIC. Indeed, the incidence of LIC in
the cervix (Table 1) was significantly higher in K14E7WTCrep53f/f
relative to K14E7WTp53f/f (57.1% versus 12.5%, respectively;
P = 0.02). The difference in the incidence of LIC in the lower
reproductive tract (Supplementary Table S2) was even greater
(57.1% versus 0%; P = 0.002). In addition, HPV E7 shortened
tumor latency and fostered more aggressive tumor progression
when placed on the p53-deficient genetic background (Fig. 1C
and D). Thus, HPV E7 cooperates with the loss of p53 to increase
cancer incidence, shorten tumor latency, and promote extensive
tumor invasion.

p53-independent activities of HPV E6 contribute to the
development of nonreproductive tumors independent of HPV
E7 but only contribute to cervical carcinogenesis in the
presence of HPV E7. The spectrum of histopathology observed
in the K14E6WTCrep53f/f and K14Crep53f/f mice was quite similar
for the cervix, indicating that E6 is not contributing any p53independent effects. The p53-independent activities of E6, however,
became apparent in the presence of E7. Whereas only 57% of
the K14E7WTCrep53f/f mice developed LIC, 100% of the K14E6WT
E7WTCrep53f/f mice developed LIC (Table 1). These results indicate
that the p53-independent activities of E6 contribute to cervical
carcinogenesis but only do so in synergy with some function(s) of
HPV E7. This synergy was observed previously with mice on
the p53-sufficient background (17). Interestingly, in the lower
reproductive tract, the p53-independent activities of E6 by itself
were weakly evident, as evidenced by the development of LIC in
K14E6WTCrep53f/f , which was not observed in the K14Crep53f/f mice,
and a significantly higher tumor multiplicity (P = 0.05) in K14E6WT
Crep53f/f mice (Supplementary Table S2). In the presence of E7, the
cooperative effects of the p53-independent activities of E6 were
again manifested in the lower reproductive tract, as evidenced by
the higher incidence of LIC in K14E6WTE7WTCrep53f/f mice (Supplementary Table S2). These observations reiterate the synergy between
the p53-independent activities of E6 and some function(s) of E7.
Although p53-independent effects of E6 were only weakly evident
in the lower reproductive tract and completely absent in the cervix,
we clearly observed these effects, independent of E7, in nonreproductive sites. Because deletion of p53 resulted in a high incidence of
cancers at other sites (Fig. 2A), we did not observe dramatic
increases in incidence in the presence of E6 and E7. However, we did
note p53-independent effects of E6 when we compared median
tumor latency (T 50 = 8 versus 10.5 months; P < 0.0001; Table 2;
Fig. 2B, ii) and tumor multiplicity in K14E6WTCrep53f/f mice relative
to that in K14Crep53f/f mice (3.9 versus 2.6, respectively; P = 0.04).
Similar to the cervix, these p53-independent effects of E6 are likely
to reflect interactions with PDZ partners given that K14E6DCrep53f/f
mice do not display the same increase in tumor multiplicity or
shortened tumor latency. Tumor multiplicity in these mice was 2.6
and median tumor latency was 11 months (Fig. 2B, iii), which were
not significantly different from that observed in the K14Crep53f/f
mice (P > 0.05 for both comparisons). These results suggest that in
nonreproductive sites p53-independent effects of HPV E6 enhance
the oncogenic potential of E6 even in the absence of E7, whereas
in the reproductive tract p53-independent effects of E6 largely
(in the lower reproductive tract) or entirely (in the cervix) require
the presence of HPV E7.
As indicated above, these p53-independent activities of E6 likely
include the interactions of E6 with PDZ partners. Specifically, we
previously found that K14E6D mice, which express a form of E6
unable to bind PDZ domain partners, have similar incidences of
cancer and tumor sizes as K14E6WT mice when treated with
estrogen for 9 months. K14E6DE7WT mice, however, were reduced
in both tumor multiplicity and tumor size when compared with
K14E6WTE7WT mice (17). Thus, the interactions of E6 with PDZ
partners synergize with some activity of HPV E7 in inducing
cervical cancer. The specific activities of E7 necessary for this
synergy with the p53-independent activities of E6 have yet to be
determined. Human cervical cancers have altered localization and
expression of Dlg and Scribble (44, 45), two PDZ partners of E6.
Based on the aforementioned findings, the roles of Dlg and Scribble
warrant further investigation to determine whether they are indeed

modulated by E6 as part of its p53-independent effects that
synergize with E7 in cervical carcinogenesis.
Modulation of the p16/pRb pathway. Analysis of various
biomarkers surprisingly revealed that cervical cancers from
K14Crep53f/f mice have similar expression patterns as tumors
expressing HPV E7. From previous results, we expected an
expression pattern similar to K14E6WT tumors, where levels of p16
were low and levels of pRb were high. Instead, we observed
predominantly elevated levels of p16 and low levels of pRb.
Observations from this study show that HPV E6 does not completely
inactivate p53. We conclude that the complete inactivation of p53
in K14Crep53f/f mice alters the mechanism of regulating the
p16/pRb pathway differently from that caused by HPV E6, which
only partially inactivates p53. Tumors in the K14Crep53f/f mice also
express low levels of Bmi-1 and pRb, indicating that there is a lack of
cell cycle checkpoints and regulation of p16 activity, at least by
Bmi-1. An inverse relationship between Bmi-1 and p16 has been
observed in some (35, 36) but not all (46) human cancers. In our
studies of cervical tumors on a p53-deficient background, we also
saw an inverse relationship but with converse results (i.e., we
observed heightened levels of p16 and modest levels of Bmi-1).
Furthermore, pRb that was observed in the p53-deficient tumors
included forms that were phosphorylated and correlated with
heightened levels of the E2F-responsive gene MCM7. Thus, in
tumors arising in p53-deficient epithelial tissues of mice treated
with estrogen, the p16/pRb pathway is grossly dysregulated.
Loss of p53 synergizes with estrogen to induce a shortened
latency for the development of mammary tumors, some with
properties of EMT. Originally, mammary tumors were not
detected in K14Crep53f/f mice without conditional deletion of
BRCA2 (23). However, recent follow-up studies determined that
spontaneous breast cancers do develop in K14Crep53f/f mice, with a
median latency of 11 months (22), or when either a MMTV- or
WAP-directed Cre was used to disrupt the floxed p53 allele (47).
In our studies, we also observed mammary tumors in female
K14Crep53f/f in the absence of any deletion of BRCA2 or BRCA1.
Importantly, we also observed that treatment of K14Crep53f/f mice
with exogenous estrogen greatly shortened the time of onset of
mammary tumors. Similar findings for p53 and breast cancer have
been observed in transplantation studies of p53-null mammary
glands into p53 wild-type BALB/c mice where exogenous
hormones, such as estrogen, significantly shortened tumor latency
relative to untreated mice (48). These observations suggest that
exogenous estrogen is driving proliferation and enhancing
tumorigenicity in the mammary gland deleted for p53.
Approximately 70% of all human breast cancers are ERa positive
(49) and many of these tumors are estrogen dependent. Estrogen
dependency is not frequently observed in mouse models for human
breast cancer. In our study, exogenous estrogen not only shortened
tumor latency but also resulted in a shift in the nuclear hormone
receptor ERa status from completely negative (23) to predominantly positive (this study; Fig. 3B). These results lead us to predict
that our mouse model system produces estrogen-dependent
mammary tumors. The mammary tumors displayed characteristics
of both myoepithelial and luminal cell types consistent with the
tumors arising from a multipotent progenitor cell. Furthermore,
the loss of p53 and exogenous estrogen resulted in phenotypes
suggestive of an EMT occurrence in a subset of the mammary
tumors. EMT is generally associated with a more aggressive
disease, as cancer cells can migrate and metastasize to other sites
to establish secondary tumors. These results suggest that estrogen

not only increased tumor incidence and shortened tumor latency
but also altered the tumor phenotype to one more representative of
