BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of strategies that incorporated bevacizumab into the primary platinum-based treatment of ovarian cancer: 1) no bevacizumab; 2) concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab
for all; 3) bevacizumab for suboptimally debulked stage III and stage IV disease (high-risk cohort); and the evaluation of an alternative
exploratory strategy of 4) directed bevacizumab therapy based on a predictive test for bevacizumab responsiveness. METHODS: A
modified Markov state transition model with a 3-year time horizon that simulated publically available International Collaboration on
Ovarian Neoplasms (ICON7) trial outcomes was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of each strategy. Costs and adverse events
were incorporated. An alternative strategy was used to model the impact on overall survival of a genetic-based predictive test. A
Monte Carlo simulation simultaneously accounted for uncertainty in key parameters. RESULTS: The incorporation of bevacizumab for
high-risk patients had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $168,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved compared with
chemotherapy alone and dominated a strategy of giving bevacizumab to all patients with ovarian cancer. Monte Carlo simulation
acceptability curves indicated that, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000 per QALY, the treatment of high-risk women with
bevacizumab was the strategy of choice in 84% of simulations. A predictive test had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of
$129,000 per QALY compared with chemotherapy alone and dominated other bevacizumab treatment strategies. CONCLUSIONS:
The selective treatment of women with suboptimal and=or stage IV ovarian cancer was a more cost-effective use of bevacizumab
than universal treatment but still did not fall within the limits of common willingness-to-pay thresholds. Continued investigation of
potentially cost-effective strategies, such as a predictive test, is necessary to optimize the use of this expensive treatment. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The biologic agent bevacizumab, a humanized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor angiogenesis, has recently been evaluated in 2 phase 3 studies for the primary treatment of ovarian cancer.1,2 Both the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms
(ICON7) trial and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study 218 (GOG-218) demonstrated improvements in
progression-free survival (PFS) with the addition of bevacizumab to standard platinum-based chemotherapy; however,
improvement in overall survival (OS) was only reported in the subset of patients enrolled on the ICON7 trial who were at
high risk for disease progression based on suboptimally debulked stage III disease or any stage IV disease. Both trials used a
strategy of concurrent bevacizumab during primary platinum-based chemotherapy followed by 12 to 16 cycles of maintenance therapy.1,2
Although adding bevacizumab resulted in improvements in PFS (4 months for GOG-218 and 2 months for
ICON7), the increased cost associated with this agent is substantial.1,2 A previous report by Cohn et al concluded that the
improvement in PFS observed with the addition of bevacizumab in GOG-218 was not cost effective; however, the
ICON7 trial design was slightly different from that of GOG-218.1-3 Specifically, in the ICON7 trial, the bevacizumab

dose was half the dose used in GOG-218 (7.5 mg=m2 vs
15 mg=m2), and patients received 4 fewer maintenance
cycles (12 vs 16 cycles). In addition, the improvement in
OS observed in the subset of patients at high risk for progression in ICON7 may signal a more cost-effective strategy for incorporating bevacizumab into the primary
treatment of ovarian cancer.
The results from these 2 large collaborative trials,
along with recent, large trials that evaluated the addition
of bevacizumab to chemotherapy for women with either
recurrent, platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant disease
and several phase 2 trials, all have demonstrated a potential benefit for bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian
cancer. With new cancer therapies becoming increasingly
more expensive and the cost of cancer care nearly doubling in the last 2 decades, strategies are needed to ensure
the delivery of cost-effective treatments and high-value,
cost-containing health care.4-10
Several investigators have reported on potential biomarkers of bevacizumab activity.11-18 Recently, Lambrechts et al identified a single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) variant that increases the expression of VEGFR1;
and, when present in the DNA of patients who were
receiving bevacizumab, this variant was associated with
worse PFS and OS in patients who were being treated
for advanced pancreatic and renal cell carcinoma.14
Those authors postulated that testing for this variant
could be a used as predictive biomarker test for response
3654

to bevacizumab treatment. Although bevacizumab clearly
has activity in the treatment of ovarian cancer, the question remains: What, if any, is the most cost-effective
strategy for incorporating bevacizumab into the primary
treatment of ovarian cancer? The purpose of the current
study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of
available strategies for incorporating bevacizumab into
the primary chemotherapy regimen for ovarian cancer.
We included strategies of treating either all patients or
no patients with bevacizumab; treating only patients
with high-risk disease, as defined by ICON7; and, in an
alternative scenario strategy, using a simulated predictive
test to identify women who may (or may not) derive a
survival advantage from the addition of bevacizumab to
primary chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A decision model was constructed using a modified Markov design and a third-party payer perspective to compare
the cost effectiveness of 3 strategies for the management of
women with ovarian cancer who are scheduled to receive a
platinum and taxane-based regimen (Fig. 1): 1) platinum
and taxane-based chemotherapy (CT), 2) chemotherapy
plus bevacizumab for all women (CT 1 B for all), and 3)
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab for women with highrisk (suboptimally debulked stage III and any stage IV)
disease (CT 1 B for high risk).

OS and adverse event outcomes were derived from
the ICON7 phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
of carboplatin=paclitaxel versus carboplatin=paclitaxel
plus bevacizumab concurrently and as maintenance.2 The
time horizon of the model was 39 months (ie, the duration of published follow-up in the ICON7 trial), by which
time disease progression or death had occurred in 50% of
patients. Costs were assigned to treatments and adverse
events. Discounting was performed at 3% annually.
We made the following key assumptions in the
model: 1) Equivalent quality of life (QOL) was assumed
between women receiving and those not receiving bevacizumab. In ICON7, both treatment arms experienced
improvement in global QOL over time. Because it was
determined that the small QOL differences observed
between arms in the trial were clinically insignificant, we
assumed no differences in QOL for purposes of the
model, 2) Based on the ICON7 trial results, we assumed
that 30% of women would be designated as “high-risk”
based on suboptimally debulked stage IIIC or any stage
IV disease. 3) Bevacizumab would be administered at a
dose of 7.5 mg=m2 with primary chemotherapy and at the
same dose as consolidation for 12 additional cycles.
Overall Survival

OS was modeled in the high-risk and low-risk groups separately based on the published and presented results from
ICON7(available at: http:==www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk=icon7=
Cancer

news.asp; accessed February 1, 2013) (Fig. 2). We did not
make assumptions about survival outcomes beyond the
time horizon of the trial. The number of patients at risk at
the beginning of each 3-month interval and the percentage surviving, but not the number of events during each
interval, were publically available. Therefore, we estimated the number of events during each interval using the
method of Hoyle and Henley.19 This method provides
more accurate estimates of mean survival compared with
the least-squares and regression methods under a plausible
range of parameter values. Because mean survival is as important, if not more important, than median survival for
cost-effectiveness analysis, methods for estimating survival
in the absence of individual patient data that provide
more accurate estimates of mean survival are preferable.
Survival curves were then modeled using beta distributions that were sampled at each Markov cycle. In a comparison of the bevacizumab-treated group versus the
control group (high-risk subset), the Hoyle and Henley
method resulted in an estimated hazard ratio (HR) of
0.65 compared with an HR of 0.64 from the ICON7
publication. In an alternative method for modeling survival data in sensitivity analysis, the HR describing the
effect on OS of the addition of bevacizumab in the highrisk group (HR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.48-0.85), modeled as a log-normal distribution, was
applied to the survival probability of the control group to
generate OS for the bevacizumab group; the impact of

analysis.
Adverse Event Rates

In the base case, adverse event rates were assigned based
on ICON7 results (Table 1).2 Adverse events with an incidence that varied significantly between treatment arms
were modeled as beta distributions. The major (grade 3-4)
adverse events that were modeled were bowel perforation
and thromboembolic events. Hypertension of grade 2 or
greater was modeled as a minor adverse event.
Costs

Cost estimates and ranges are listed in Table 1; all costs
were updated to 2011 US dollars using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index (available at:
http:==www.bls.gov=cpi; accessed February 1, 2013). We
assumed that the cost of each chemotherapy regimen
included routine laboratory work, consisting of a complete blood count and a metabolic panel before each cycle.
Costs were estimated from Common Procedural Terminology and J codes using 2011 Medicare reimbursement
data (available at: https:==www.cms.gov; accessed February 1, 2013) and included the costs of premedications,
3656

such as antiemetics, chemotherapy drugs, and administration=infusion fees.
Costs of major adverse events were estimated using
the cost of hospitalization for each condition as follows:
Inpatient costs were obtained using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9) codes (gastrointestinal perforation, ICD-9 code 569.83; pulmonary
embolism, ICD-9 code 415.19) to search the 2009
national database of the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality’s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
Nationwide Inpatient Sample (available at: http:==www.
hcupnet.ahrq.gov; accessed February 1, 2013) for mean
and median costs of hospitalization. Major adverse event
costs were modeled as log-normal distributions for use in
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The cost of hypertension
included all cost expenditures associated with hypertension for 1 year.20
Sensitivity Analysis

The base case model was run as a Monte Carlo simulation
of 1000 trials to account for uncertainty in key parameters. Survival, the probability of high-risk disease, and the
probability of adverse events were modeled using beta
distributions, whereas the costs of adverse events were
modeled using log-normal distributions. Cost and

effectiveness estimates derived from Monte Carlo simulations were expressed as median values with confidence
intervals based on the results from individual trial runs.
Acceptability curves were then constructed with the
willingness-to pay-threshold varied between zero and
$200,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of a small
decrement in health-related QOL during bevacizumab
treatment. Because individual components of the global
European Organization of Research and Treatment of
Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 scores
were not reported in the primary ICON7 publication, a
direct conversion of these data into a utility score was not
possible. Therefore, for sensitivity analysis, we modeled a
small, clinically significant decrease in the utility score
(20.05) during treatment with bevacizumab.21,22 In
addition, key clinical estimates, survival estimates, costs,
and assumptions were varied over reasonable ranges to
test the model’s results in 1-way sensitivity analyses.
Alternative Scenario: Test for Bevacizumab
Responsiveness

On the basis of a recently reported genetic variant in the
VEGF pathway that appears to independently predict
response to bevacizumab in pancreatic and renal cancer,
we explored the potential effectiveness and cost effectiveness of an SNP biomarker predictive test to direct the use
of bevacizumab in the high-risk (suboptimally debulked
or stage IV disease) population.14 Briefly, we assumed
that an allelic distribution at the relevant SNP locus was
similar to that reported by Lambrechts et al, with 3 possible results: homozygous favorable, heterozygous, and
homozygous unfavorable. We used HRs calculated from
an additive model, as described by Lambrechts et al, to
estimate relative response in patients with 1 or 2 copies of
Cancer

the favorable allele compared with those with no copies,
and we applied these HRs to the modeled survival data
from the ICON7 high-risk population (Table 2).
RESULTS
Base Case

In the base case, the mean costs and 95% CIs for each
strategy were as follows: CT for all, $6220 (95% CI,
$5800-$6667); CT 1 B for high risk, $20,751 (95% CI,
$18,517-$23,017); and CT 1 B for all, $56,351 (95%
CI, $56,052-$56,682). The mean effectiveness and 95%
CIs for each strategy were as follows: CT for all, 2.80
QALYs (95% CI, 2.74-2.86 QALYs); CT 1 B for high
risk, 2.89 QALYs (95% CI, 2.84-2.94 QALYs); and
CT 1 B for all, 2.88 QALYs (95% CI, 2.83-2.93 QALYs).
The minimally higher mean effectiveness of CT 1 B for
high risk compared with CT 1 B for all was because of a
slight difference in the ICON7 survival curves for the
low-risk groups (available at: http:==www.ctu.mrc.
ac.uk=icon7=news.asp; accessed February 1, 2013).
In the base case, CT 1 B for high risk had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $168,083 per
QALY compared with CT for all. CT 1 B for all was
dominated (less effective and more expensive) compared
with CT 1 B for high risk. Figure 3A is an acceptability
curve for the base case. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of
$100,000 per QALY, CT for all is the strategy of choice.
At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $150,000 per QALY
and $200,000 per QALY, CT 1 B for high risk is the strategy of choice in 24% and 82% of simulations, respectively.
Alternative Scenario: Test for Bevacizumab
Responsiveness

In the alternative scenario, the mean costs and 95% CIs
for each strategy were: CT for all, $6211 (95% CI,
3657

Original Article

$5810-$6600); test for bevacizumab (B) responsiveness,
$19,605 (95% CI, $17,507-$21,776); CT 1 B for high
risk, $20,758 (95% CI, $18,633-$22,996); and CT 1 B
for all, $56,334 (95% CI, $56,056-$56,668). The mean
effectiveness and 95% CIs were: CT for all, 2.80 QALYs
(95% CI, 2.74-2.86 QALYs); test for B responsiveness,
2.91 QALYs (95% CI, 2.85-2.96 QALYs); CT 1 B for
high risk, 2.89 QALYs (95% CI, 2.84-2.93 QALYs); and
CT 1 B for all, 2.88 QALYs (95% CI, 2.84-2.93
QALYs).
In the alternative scenario, the test for B responsiveness had an ICER of $128,928 per QALY compared with
CT for all. Both CT 1 B for high risk and CT 1 B for all
were dominated by the test for B responsiveness in this
scenario. The acceptability curve for the alternative scenario is depicted in Figure 3B. CT for all was the strategy
of choice in 100% of simulations when the willingness-topay threshold was <$100,000 per QALY. At thresholds
of $150,000 per QALY and $200,000 per QALY, the test
for B responsiveness was the strategy of choice in 75% and
93% of simulations, respectively.
Key Sensitivity Analyses

cost-effective choice based on the willingness-to-pay threshold depicted on the x-axis. (Top) In the base case, the graph
depicts high-risk patients who receive carboplatin and paclitaxel (C=T) plus bevacizumab (B) (C=T 1 B for High Risk),
those who receive CT without bevacizumab (C=T for All), and
those who receive C=T 1 B (C=T 1 B for All). QALY indicates
quality-adjusted life year. (Bottom) In an alternative scenario
that included testing for bevacizumab responsiveness, the
graph depicts the receipt of C=T 1 B by high-risk patients
from the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms
ICON7 trial (C=T 1 B for High Risk); the receipt of C=T without
B for all patients (C=T for All); the receipt of C=T 1 B for all
patients (C=T 1 B for All); and the results from C=T 1 B treatment only for those who test positive with a predictive test
(Test for B Response).

3658

In a 1-way sensitivity analysis of the base case scenario, the
cost effectiveness of CT 1 B for high risk versus CT 1 B
for all was sensitive to the unit cost of bevacizumab (Fig.
4). Because the cost of bevacizumab was reduced to 50%
of its current cost, the ICER dropped below a common
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY.
CT 1 B for all was never cost effective, with an ICER
exceeding $200,000 per QALY compared with CT for all
regardless of the reduction in cost.
In a 1-way sensitivity analysis of the alternative scenario, when the cost of the test for B responsiveness was
varied from our baseline estimate of $500 up to $5000,
the ICER of the test for B responsiveness, compared with
CT for all, remained between $125,000 per QALY and
$167,000 per QALY. CT 1 B for high risk remained
dominated by the test for B responsiveness unless the cost
of the test was $4500.
In a sensitivity analysis of the base case scenario, a
minimal, clinically significant decrement in the healthrelated QOL utility score (20.05) was modeled. In this
analysis, CT 1 B for high risk had an ICER of $175,896
per QALY compared with CT for all. CT 1 B for all
remained dominated (less effective and more expensive)
compared with CT 1 B for high risk.
In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the alternative survival calculation method, CT 1 B for high
risk had an ICER of $164,063 per QALY compared with

DISCUSSION
Two randomized trials have clearly established the biologic activity of bevacizumab in the primary treatment of
ovarian cancer.1,2 Concerns exist about whether the small
PFS benefit observed with the addition of bevacizumab
for all patients in these trials justifies the high costs associated with this treatment. A previous cost analysis by Cohn
et al concluded that universal administration of bevacizumab to women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer was
not cost effective, with an ICER exceeding $400,000 per
progression-free year of life saved.3 Our analysis modeling
the results from the ICON7 trail confirms the results of
Cohn et al and demonstrates that, even when using a
lower dose and 4 fewer cycles, bevacizumab given universally with standard, platinum-based chemotherapy is not
cost effective compared with chemotherapy alone.
Despite those previous studies, the proven biologic
activity of bevacizumab merits the investigation of treatCancer

October 15, 2013

ment strategies that may be more cost effective. In the
ICON7 trial, the subset of patients considered to be at
high risk for disease progression (those who were suboptimally debulked at the time of their primary debulking
surgery and=or had stage IV disease) gained an 8-month
improvement in OS with the addition of bevacizumab to
primary chemotherapy.2 We now demonstrate that a
strategy of treating only high-risk patients with bevacizumab is both as effective and less costly than treating all
patients. Compared with the chemotherapy-only strategy
(no bevacizumab), treating high-risk patients with bevacizumab has an ICER of $168,000 per QALY. Although
this ICER still does not meet a commonly used threshold
for determining cost effectiveness of $100,000 per
QALY, it represents a dramatic improvement compared
with the strategy of treating all patients with bevacizumab. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether the
traditional willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 to
$100,000 per QALY—originally established in the dialysis literature several decades ago—may be outdated and
should be raised to reflect our current economy and practice patterns.23 Regardless, during sensitivity analyses in
the current model, the ICER improves to <$100,000
per QALY when the cost of bevacizumab is reduced by
50% and to <$50,000 per QALY when the cost is
reduced to 25% of its current value.
In an effort to evaluate other strategies for improving
the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab, we investigated an
alternative strategy that used a predictive test based on a
recent study by Lambrechts et al, who demonstrated the
use of a genetic SNP to predict the outcome of bevacizumab treatment.14 The strategy of using a predictive test to
direct bevacizumab treatment had an ICER of $128,000
per QALY and dominated the other bevacizumab strategies that were evaluated in the base case analysis.
Although there is currently not a predictive biomarker test
for bevacizumab responsiveness, the study by Lambrechts
et al is encouraging pilot work toward this goal and the
first to demonstrate a predictive relation to survival; and
several other studies also have identified potential biomarkers related to bevacizumab.11-18 The study by Lambrechts et al was performed in renal cell and pancreatic
cancers, and it was assumed for the purposes of exploratory modeling that similar results might apply to ovarian
cancer; however, it is possible that this biomarker would
not have the same application in ovarian cancer. However,
to our knowledge, theirs is the only study to date identifying a biomarker that has survival implications for patients
who receive bevacizumab. In addition, in cancers with
known biomarkers, comparative analysis studies

evaluating the use of these biomarkers to guide treatment
have demonstrated that this strategy can be cost effective
and beneficial, and reports have indicated that genetic
analyses, like those required for SNP assessment, can be
efficient and cost effective.11,14,24-28
Like most cost-effectiveness models, cost data were
not gathered prospectively in the ICON7 trial, and
assumptions and estimates were necessary to model the
costs of treatment and adverse events. To begin with, the
subgroup analysis performed in ICON7 requires validation in future studies to strengthen the conclusions in
our analysis. In addition, cost data gathered prospectively
in the clinical trial would provide a more accurate cost
analysis; however, the Monte Carlo simulation we used
allowed us to test the robustness of our results. Although
the ICON7 trial used a lower dose and fewer cycles of
bevacizumab, there has not been widespread adoption of
this regimen in the United States. Although there is no
reason to believe that the lower dose used in ICON7 is
not as effective as the higher US dosing regimen for
front-line therapy, unless the lower dosing regimen is
adopted in the United States, the higher US dosing will
be less cost effective. Another limitation to the study is
that, even though QOL scores did not differ significantly
between groups in the ICON7 trial, there was a small
but statistically significant decrease in QOL in the
bevacizumab-containing arms before cycle 4 of therapy.2
Although that decrease was statistically significant, the
ICON7 investigators initially determined that the difference was not clinically significant; however, in a recent
report, when QOL outcomes from ICON7 were published separately, the investigators concluded that
patients who received bevacizumab had a small, clinically
significant decrement in QOL compared with patients
who received standard treatment.29 However, a transient
change in QOL during treatment would be unlikely to
have any impact on the cost effectiveness of each regimen, so this difference was not included in the base case
analysis. Furthermore, when QOL scores were varied in
the sensitivity analysis, no significant differences were
observed from the base case analysis. In the recurrent setting, studies have demonstrated improved PFS using a
strategy of administering bevacizumab until documentation of progression; however, this strategy would be very
expensive; it has not been studied in the primary treatment of ovarian cancer; and, thus, it would be inappropriate to incorporate it into the current model. Further
cost-effectiveness studies also would include using bevacizumab solely in the recurrent setting, assuming that
patients who are going to be cured would be cured with
3660

surgery=chemotherapy alone and ultimately reducing the
use and overall cost of bevacizumab.
Although 2 phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated
a small clinical benefit with the addition of bevacizumab
to primary chemotherapy, the high cost of the treatment
renders it not cost effective when given to all women with
advanced ovarian cancer. The rising costs of health care
are unsustainable; high-value, cost-conscious health care
is required for cost containment in our health care economic system. However, the biologic activity of bevacizumab cannot be overlooked, and strategies must continue
to be investigated to improve the cost effectiveness of this
treatment and other emerging but costly novel therapies.
Although including bevacizumab in primary platinumbased chemotherapy for ovarian cancer for all patients
clearly is not cost effective, treating patients who have suboptimal and=or stage IV disease may represent a more
cost-conscious approach, especially if the cost of bevacizumab is reduced. In addition, the exploratory analysis in
our model suggests that a predictive test for bevacizumab
efficacy may improve its cost effectiveness compared with
its global use. For now, the role of bevacizumab in the primary treatment of ovarian cancer remains to be determined. First consideration still should be given to
strategies with a proven OS advantage that are also cost
effective, such as intraperitoneal chemotherapy for optimally cytoreduced patients. However, our model suggests
that cost-effective strategies for the use of bevacizumab
may be achievable and that continued efforts should be
made in this regard. If the findings of an OS advantage in
a high-risk=stage IV population are validated by future
prospective trials, then the use of bevacizumab in this population can be deemed a cost-conscious approach that also
may become cost effective as the price of bevacizumab
drops.
