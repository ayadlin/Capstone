ABSTRACT
EGFR mutated lung cancer accounts for a significant subgroup of non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Over the last decade, multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs) have been developed to target mutated EGFR. However, there is little
information regarding mutation specific potency of EGFR-TKIs against various types
of EGFR mutations. The purpose of this study is to establish an in vitro model to
determine the “therapeutic window” of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR
mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The potency of 1st (erlotinib),
2nd (afatinib) and 3rd (osimertinib and rociletinib) generation EGFR-TKIs was compared
in vitro for human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells, which exogenously express
mutated or wild type EGFR. An in vitro model of mutation specificity was created by
calculating the ratio of IC50 values between mutated and wild type EGFR. The in vitro
model identified a wide therapeutic window of afatinib for exon 19 deletions and
L858R and of osimertinib and rociletinib for T790M positive mutations. The results
obtained with our models matched well with previously reported preclinical and
clinical data. Interestingly, for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, most of which are
known to be resistant to 1st and 2nd generation EGFR-TKIS, osimertinib was potent
and presented a wide therapeutic window. To our knowledge, this is the first report
that has identified the therapeutic window of osimertinib for EGFR exon 20 insertion
mutations. In conclusion, this model will provide a preclinical rationale for proper
selection of EGFR-TKIs against clinically-relevant EGFR mutations.

EGFR mutations are expected to activate the EGFR by
destabilizing the inactive form of EGFR without ligand
stimulation [7–9]. Activated EGFR induces EGFRmediated pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signals through
downstream targets such as extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related
death worldwide [1]. The identification of somatic
mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) kinase domain helped our understanding of the
biology of lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations [2–6].

B (AKT) [10, 11]. Inhibition of the EGFR pathway leads
to the down-regulation of pro-survival signals and upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecules [12], by which
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) exert their
dramatic effects in patients with EGFR mutated lung
cancer.
EGFR mutations have been identified in
approximately 10–30% of non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) [13, 14]. The most common, “classic” mutations
are in-frame deletions around the LREA motif of exon
19 (approximately 45% of EGFR mutations) and the
exon 21 L858R point mutation (approximately 40% of
EGFR mutations). Other relatively rare EGFR mutations
include, G719X (3% of EGFR mutations) and L861Q (2%
of EGFR mutations) [10]. Another main group of EGFR
mutations include exon 20 insertion mutations (4–10% of
EGFR mutations) [15, 16].
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs)
have been developed to target mutated EGFR. EGFRTKIs reversibly or irreversibly bind to the ATP binding
pocket of EGFR and inhibit the phosphorylation of EGFR,
thereby inhibiting the activation of the EGFR signaling
pathway. The exon 19 deletions, L858R, G719X, and
L861Q mutations are 1st generation EGFR-TKIs, gefitinib
and erlotinib, sensitizing mutations. The response rates to
gefitinib or erlotinib are around 60–80% [14, 17].
Most EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are 1st
generation EGFR-TKIs resistant mutations [15, 18, 19].
One exception is EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA, which
we previously reported as another 1st generation EGFRTKIs sensitizing mutation [20]. For these 1st generation
EGFR-TKIs resistant exon 20 insertion mutations, no
potent inhibitor has been reported. Therefore, patients
with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations
present a shorter survival time compared to patients
with classic EGFR mutations [21]. The development of
EGFR-TKIs, which effectively inhibit EGFR with exon
20 insertions, but not the wild type EGFR, has been
anticipated.
The 1st generation reversible EGFR-TKIs, gefitinib
and erlotinib, dramatically changed the treatment strategy
for patients harboring EGFR mutated lung cancer. The
significant benefit of gefitinib or erlotinib for patients with
NSCLC harboring EGFR-TKIs sensitizing mutations was
repeatedly demonstrated in multiple clinical trials [22, 23].
However, despite the initial favorable response, lung
cancer cells eventually acquire resistance to gefitinib or
erlotinib. EGFR T790M mutations account for about 50%
of acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib [24,  25].
To target EGFR mutations, including EGFR T790M
mutation, multiple EGFR-TKIs have been developed.
These include 2nd generation EGFR-TKIs, afatinib [26]
and dacomitinib [27, 28], as well as 3rd generation EGFRTKIs, WZ4002 [29], osimertinib (formerly AZD9291)
[30, 31] and rociletinib [32, 33].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Afatinib, a clinically available 2nd generation
EGFR-TKI, is potent against EGFR mutated lung cancer
cells in vitro [26] and in vivo [34, 35]. However, for
EGFR T790M mutated lung cancer, it failed to overcome
EGFR T790M-mediated resistance in patients [36, 37].
Osimertinib and rociletinib are 3rd generation EGFRTKIs, both of which are reported to be effective in lung
cancer cells harboring EGFR T790M in preclinical
models [30, 32]. Promising results of phase I/II study of
osimertinib and rociletinib have recently been published.
Osimertinib showed a promising safety and efficacy, the
response rate and progression free survival for EGFR
T790M positive patients was 61% and 9.6 months,
respectively [38]. Similarly, the response rate of rociletinib
for EGFR T790M positive patients was 59% [39].
Today, we have multiple EGFR-TKI options to treat
patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations.
However, there is no clear guideline regarding which
EGFR-TKIs should be used for which mutation. To
solve this problem and provide a model, which clinicians
or physician scientists could refer to, we examined and
compared the potency of EGFR-TKIs against lung cancer
cell lines harboring various types of EGFR mutations.
In addition, we created an in vitro model, which allows
us to determine the therapeutic window of EGFR-TKIs.
This model will provide a preclinical rationale for proper
selection of EGFR-TKIs against clinically-relevant EGFR
mutations.

RESULTS
Comparison of the sensitivity/resistance profile
of Ba/F3 stable cell lines
In order to directly compare the sensitivity of
multiple EGFR mutations to EGFR-TKIs, we generated
EGFR transduced Ba/F3 stable cell lines. Wild type and
mutated EGFR were exogenously transduced into Ba/F3
cells. The sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs was evaluated by
MTS assay with or without EGFR-TKIs.
Cell growth of Ba/F3 cells harboring classic EGFR
mutations, exon 19 deletion (exon 19del) and L858R, was
dramatically inhibited by afatinib (Figure 1A). Although
less potent than afatinib, erlotinib effectively inhibited the
proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. The potency of osimertinib
was comparable to that of erlotinib, while rociletinib was
less potent than erlotinib and osimertinib.
Erlotinib did not inhibit the proliferation of Ba/F3
cells harboring EGFR T790M mutations, EGFR exon
19del+T790M, and L858R+T790M, at low concentrations.
However, afatinib and 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs,
osimertinib and rociletinib, effectively inhibited the
proliferation of Ba/F3 cells (Figure 1B).
In the clinic, skin rash, interstitial pneumonia,
or diarrhea are common or life threatening side

the effect of EGFR-TKIs on the wild type EGFR, we
performed an MTS assay in the presence of EGF and
with or without EGFR-TKIs (Figure 1C). Ba/F3 cells
were efficiently inhibited by afatinib. The IC50 value
of afatinib was 31 nM, whereas those of the other three
EGFR-TKIs were comparable, indicating that afatinib
was the most potent EGFR-TKI against the wild type
EGFR.
Immunoblotting was then performed to examine
whether the aforementioned effect of EGFR-TKIs on
Ba/F3 cells was exerted through inhibition of the EGFR
signaling pathway (Figure 2).
In Ba/F3 cells harboring classic EGFR mutations,
exon 19 deletions and L858R, afatinib dramatically
inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and
ERK. Erlotinib and osimertinib comparably inhibited
the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK. Erlotinib
did not inhibit the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and
ERK in Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR T790M mutations,
exon 19del+T790M, and L858R+T790M. However,
afatinib and 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib and
rociletinib, effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of
EGFR, AKT, and ERK. These data indicate that the
sensitivity of Ba/F3 cells to EGFR-TKIs was mediated

through inhibition of the EGFR and downstream
signals.

Establishment of an in vitro model to determine
the therapeutic window of EGFR-TKIs
The IC50 values of all EGFR-TKIs examined in this
study are summarized in Figure 3A. Afatinib is reported
to be ineffective against lung cancer harboring EGFR
T790M positive mutations, because concentrations at
which afatinib inhibits lung cancer cells harboring EGFR
T790M are not achievable in humans due to dose limiting
toxicities such as skin rash and diarrhea, indicating
a narrow therapeutic window of afatinib for EGFR
T790M [40].
To provide an estimation of the therapeutic
window of EGFR-TKIs, we created an in vitro model
by calculating the ratio of IC50 values of the wild type
EGFR and mutated EGFR, referred to as the selectivity
index (SI) (Figure 3B). In this model, the selectivity
of each EGFR-TKI is high if the SI value is low. For
Ba/F3 cells harboring classic EGFR mutations, exon
19  deletions and L858R, afatinib showed the lowest
SI  values among EGFR-TKIs studied in this study,

and rociletinib were used as EGFR-TKIs. pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK indicate the phosphorylated form of EGFR, AKT, and ERK,

indicating a wide therapeutic window of afatinib for these
mutations. Interestingly, for Ba/F3 cells harboring classic
EGFR mutations, osimertinib showed mutation specificity
similar to that of afatinib, and the SI values were around -2,
indicating IC50 values for these classic mutations were
about 100-fold lower than those for the wild-type EGFR.
For Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR T790M,
3rd  generation EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib and rociletinib,
showed striking mutation specificity. The SI values were
around -2 or lower, indicating IC50 values for T790M
mutation more than 100-fold lower than those for the
wild-type EGFR. Unfortunately, erlotinib and afatinib did
not demonstrate mutation specificity for EGFR T790M
mutations. The SI values were more than zero, indicating
that the IC50 values of erlotinib and afatinib for EGFR
T790M mutations were higher than those for the wild-type
EGFR.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To determine and to confirm the clinical relevance of
this in vitro model, we reviewed the data of human clinical
trials. The efficacy of erlotinib for classic EGFR mutations
[41, 42] and inefficacy of erlotinib for T790M mutations are
reported [24] and well accepted. Our in vitro model clearly
indicated the difference of erlotinib efficacy for classic
EGFR mutations and its inefficacy for T790M mutations.
Again, the efficacy of afatinib for classic EGFR mutations
[43] and its inefficacy for T790M mutations are reported
[36]. Data from our in vitro model were in agreement with
these results. The efficacy of osimertinib and rociletinib for
patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR T790M mutation and
little dose limiting toxicities have recently been described.
The striking mutation specificity of osimertinib and
rociletinib shown in the model matches well with the results
of the reported trials. In summary, the results of our in vitro
model match well with the reported clinical trials.

Confirmation of the sensitivity/resistance profile
of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer cell lines

Consistent with the results of the MTS assay, afatinib
most potently inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR and
downstream proteins, AKT and ERK, in PC-9 and H3255
cells. Although less potent than afatinib, erlotinib and
osimertinib effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of
EGFR, AKT, and ERK in PC-9 and H3255. For the lung
cancer cells harboring EGFR T790M, all EGFR-TKIs,
but erlotinib, effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of
EGFR, AKT, and ERK.
In summary, these data indicate that the sensitivity/
resistance profile observed in Ba/F3 cells was confirmed
in human lung cancer cells.

Furthermore, to confirm that the sensitivity/
resistance profile data from Ba/F3 stable cells are also
observed in EGFR mutated human lung cancer derived
cell lines, we performed MTS assay with or without
EGFR-TKIs using human lung cancer derived cell lines
(Figure 4A). The lung cancer cell lines used included
PC-9 (EGFR exon 19del), H3255 (EGFR L858R),
PC-9ER (EGFR exon 19 del+T790M), and H1975 (EGFR
L858R+T790M).
The IC50 values of lung cancer cell lines are
summarized in Table 1. For cell lines harboring classic
EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletions (PC-9) and L858R
(H3255), afatinib showed the most dramatic inhibitory
effect. The calculated IC50 values of afatinib for PC-9 and
H3255 were 0.8 nM and 0.3 nM, respectively. Although
less potent than afatinib, erlotinib effectively inhibited the
proliferation of lung cancer cells as previously described
[20]. The calculated IC50 values of erlotinib for PC-9
and H3255 were 7 nM and 12 nM, respectively. The
potency of osimertinib was comparable to that of erlotinib.
However, rociletinib was less potent than erlotinib and
osimertinib. The calculated IC50 values of osimertinib for
PC-9 and H3255 were 17 nM and 4 nM, respectively. The
calculated IC50 values of rociletinib for PC-9 and H3255
were 84 nM and 35 nM, respectively.
Erlotinib did not inhibit the proliferation of cell
lines harboring EGFR T790M, PC-9ER and H1975, at
low concentrations. However, afatinib and 3rd generation
EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib and rociletinib, effectively
inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells. The
calculated IC50 values of afatinib, osimertinib, and
rociletinib for PC-9ER were 165 nM, 13 nM, and 37 nM,
respectively. The calculated IC50 values of afatinib,
osimertinib, and rociletinib for H1975 were 57 nM, 5 nM,
and 23 nM, respectively. These data indicate that the
sensitivity/resistance profile data observed in Ba/F3 stable
cells are similar to those observed in human lung cancer
cell lines.
Furthermore, immunoblotting was performed to
determine whether the aforementioned sensitivity of
lung cancer cells to EGFR-TKIs was mediated through
inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway (Figure 4B).

Application of the in vitro model to EGFR
exon 20 insertion mutations
Except for EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA, most
of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are reported to
be resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs. Recently, the
results of a clinical trial assessing afatinib treatment of
patients with advanced NSCLC harboring uncommon
EGFR mutations, including exon 20 insertion mutations
have been reported [44]. Of the 23 NSCLC patients
harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, only two
(8.7%) patients presented an objective response, indicating
the limited efficacy of afatinib for exon 20 insertion
mutations.
Until now, there is no EGFR-TKI reported to be
effective against exon 20 insertion mutations. To examine
the sensitivity/resistance profile of EGFR exon 20
insertion mutations to EGFR-TKIs, we performed MTS
assays with or without EGFR-TKIs using cells harboring
four representative EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations,
namely, A763_Y764insFQEA, Y764_V765insHH, A767_
V769dupASV, and D770_N771insNPG (Figure 5A).
Afatinib potently inhibited the growth of cells harboring
EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA. Of the other three EGFRTKIs, osimertinib most effectively inhibited Ba/F3 cell
growth.
Interestingly, for other 1st generation EGFR-TKIs
resistant EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, osimertinib
and afatinib presented similar efficacy. The IC50 values
of afatinib for Y764_V765insHH, A767_V769dupASV,
and D770_N771insNPG were 134, 158, and 43 nM,

respectively. The IC50 values of osimertinib for
Y764_V765insHH, A767_V769dupASV, and D770_
N771insNPG were 237, 333, and 42 nM, respectively
(Figure 5B).
To estimate the therapeutic window of EGFRTKIs for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, we applied
the aforementioned in vitro model to exon 20 insertion
mutations (Figure 5C). Surprisingly, we found that
osimertinib presented the lowest SI values of around −1,
indicating IC50 values for EGFR exon 20 insertion
mutations about 10 fold lower than those for the wild type
EGFR. However, the SI values of other EGFR-TKIs were
around or above zero. These data indicate that osimertinib
may present a wide therapeutic window and is effective
for several exon 20 insertion mutations.

of EGFR, AKT, and ERK was similar between osimertinib
and afatinib.
Finally, to confirm the therapeutic window of
osimertinib for 1st generation EGFR-TKIs resistant EGFR
exon 20 insertion mutations, we performed apoptosis
assays using Ba/F3 cells harboring wild type EGFR
and EGFR D770_N771insNPG. We stained the Ba/F3
cells with annexin V-APC and propidium iodide after
48 h of EGFR-TKI treatment (0.1 μM). The proportion
of annexin-V positive and/or propidium iodide positive
cells was examined by flow cytometry (Figure 6C).
As expected, afatinib induced apoptosis in both Ba/
F3 cells harboring wild type EGFR and EGFR D770_
N771insNPG, indicating a narrow therapeutic window of
afatinib for EGFR D770_N771insNPG. The proportion
of annexin-V positive cells was 82.5% for the wild type
EGFR and 56.0% for EGFR D770_N771insNPG. In
contrast, the effect of osimertinib on apoptosis in Ba/F3
cells harboring wild type EGFR was low, while it was
high in Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR D770_N771insNPG.
The proportion of annexin-V positive cells was 29.1%
for the wild type EGFR and 48.6% for EGFR D770_
N771insNPG. These data indicate the wide therapeutic
window of osimertinib for EGFR D770_N771insNPG.
In summary, we biologically confirmed the efficacy
and therapeutic window of osimertinib for EGFR exon
20 insertion mutations.

Biological confirmation of osimertinib efficacy
for lung cancer harboring EGFR exon 20
insertion mutations
To biologically confirm the aforementioned efficacy
of osimertinib for lung cancer harboring EGFR exon
20 insertion mutations, further in vitro analyses were
performed.
First, to confirm whether the above sensitivity pattern
observed in Ba/F3 cells was also observed in human lung
cancer cell lines, we performed immunoblotting and MTS
assays using BID007 (EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA) cells
(Figure 6A). To our knowledge BID007 is the only cell
line harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which
we originally established [20]. The sensitivity pattern and
inhibition of the phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream
proteins were consistent with the results observed in
Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA. The
most dramatic inhibition of cell growth was observed with
afatinib. The calculated IC50 value of afatinib for BID007
was 8 nM. Although less potent than afatinib, erlotinib
and osimertinib effectively inhibited the proliferation
of BID007 cells. The calculated IC50 value of erlotinib
and osimertinib for BID007 was 45  nM and 40 nM,
respectively. However, rociletinib was less potent than
erlotinib and osimertinib. The calculated IC50 value of
rociletinib for BID007 was 1278 nM. These data indicate
that the sensitivity pattern observed in Ba/F3 cells was also
observed in human lung cancer cell line, BID007.
Next, to confirm that the sensitivity of Ba/F3 cells
harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations was exerted
through inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway, we
performed immunoblotting (Figure 6B). As expected,
for EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA, afatinib dramatically
inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and
ERK. Erlotinib and osimertinib similarly inhibited the
phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK. For other 1st
generation EGFR-TKIs resistant EGFR exon 20 insertion
mutations, Y764_V765insHH, A767_V769dupASV and
D770_N771insNPG, the inhibition of the phosphorylation

DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared the potency of erlotinib,
afatinib, osimertinib, and rociletinib against multiple types
of EGFR mutations such as classic EGFR mutations, exon
19 deletions and L858R, with or without T790M, or exon
20 insertion mutations. Because EGFR is ubiquitously
expressed in epithelial cells, EGFR-TKIs induce toxicity
when EGFR-TKIs affect the wild type EGFR in epithelial
cells. Hence, the therapeutic window, i.e., the difference
in term of the concentrations that affect the wild type and
mutated EGFR, is important. In this study, we created an
in vitro model to determine the therapeutic window of
EGFR-TKIs by calculating the ratio of IC50 values of
EGFR-TKIs in cells stably expressing the wild type EGFR
or the mutated EGFR.
In general, the data from Ba/F3 stable cell lines and
human lung cancer derived cell lines were consistent. For
classic EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletions and L858R,
afatinib was the most potent. Our data also showed a
wide therapeutic window of afatinib for these mutations.
However, in the clinic, the high frequency of adverse
events such as skin rash or diarrhea is repeatedly reported
[34, 35], indicating that the in vivo concentration of
afatinib might exceed the concentration that inhibits the
wild type EGFR. It is possible that, by reducing the dose,
afatinib retains its ability to inhibit the mutated EGFR, but
not the wild type EGFR.

For EGFR T790M positive mutations, osimertinib
and rociletinib showed a strikingly potent inhibition
compared to erlotinib or afatinib. In addition, osimertinib
and rociletinib showed a wide therapeutic window for
these mutations. These data indicate that osimertinib and
rociletinib are effective and safe EGFR-TKIs for EGFR
T790M positive mutations. In human clinical trials,
osimertinib and rociletinib showed promising safety and
efficacy, even though some hyperglycemia was observed
in patients treated with rociletinib [38, 39].
Interestingly, for 1st generation EGFR-TKIs
resistant exon 20 insertion mutations, Y764_V765insHH,
A767V769dupASV, and D770_N771insNPG, osimertinib
showed a similar potency and higher mutation specificity
than afatinib. However, the IC50 values of osimertinib
for these exon 20 insertion mutations are 10 to 100 fold
higher than those for the classic EGFR mutations with or
without T790M mutations. Thus, higher concentrations
of osimertinib may be necessary to effectively treat the
patients with 1st generation EGFR-TKIs resistant exon 20
insertion mutations.
Preliminary pharmacokinetic profile, showing total
plasma concentrations of osimertinib, was reported [30].
The mean plasma concentration of 6 patients treated with
once-daily 20 mg oral osimertinib dosing in the AURA
phase I study (NCT01802632) was around 100 nM,
which is around the IC50 values found in this study for
1st generation EGFR-TKIs resistant exon 20  insertion
mutations (42–333nM). In addition, the results of this
phase I study have been reported [38]. The patients were
assigned to once-daily dosing from 20 mg to 240 mg.
No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during the
28-day evaluation period at any dose levels. Therefore,
a maximum tolerated dose was not determined. The
maximum serum concentrations were 106.3, 305.1, 635.4,
1006, and 1510 nM for 20, 40, 80, 160, and 240 mg dose
levels, respectively. These data indicate that osimertinib
concentration may be adjusted to the level that effectively
inhibits the mutant EGFR, but not the wild type EGFR. To
examine the efficacy of osimertinib for NSCLC harboring
1st generation EGFR-TKIs resistant exon 20 insertion
mutations, dose adjusted clinical trials are anticipated.
From the EGFR-TKIs oriented viewpoint, erlotinib
is effective for EGFR exon 19 deletions, L858R, and
A763_Y764insFQEA. However, erlotinib does not seem
to be effective for EGFR T790M positive mutations as
previously described [20]. Afatinib seems to be effective
and has a wide therapeutic window for EGFR exon 19
deletion and L858R. However, afatinib was less potent
than osimertinib and rociletinib for EGFR T790M positive
mutations. Osimertinib and rociletinib showed a potent
efficacy and a wide therapeutic window for EGFR T790M
positive mutations.
Even for 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs, the potency
spectrum was clearly different between osimertinib
and rociletinib. Interestingly, for EGFR 19 deletion and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

L858R, osimertinib efficacy was comparable with that
of erlotinib, indicating that osimertinib can be used for
EGFR 19 deletion and L858R as first line EGFR-TKI.
Furthermore, we identified the therapeutic window of
osimertinib for 1st generation EGFR-TKIs resistant exon
20 insertion mutations. The reason why osimertinib
showed a distinct wide mutation spectrum is unknown.
However, it may be partly due to the distinct chemical
structure of this compound [30]. To our knowledge, this is
the first report, which clearly demonstrates the difference
in term of mutation spectrum of EGFR-TKIs against
various types of EGFR mutations.
However, our study includes only in vitro study.
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may
vary among EGFR-TKIs. Hence, EGFR-TKI in vivo
concentrations may vary among EGFR-TKIs. To further
develop a better strategy for using EGFR-TKIs, further in
vivo and human clinical trials are mandatory.
In summary, we created an in vitro model to
determine the therapeutic window of EGFR-TKIs, which
matched well with the data obtained from human clinical
trials. Interestingly, by applying the model, osimertinib
showed the widest therapeutic window in relation to wild
type EGFR for most mutations including EGFR exon 20
insertion mutations. This model will provide a preclinical
rationale for proper selection of EGFR-TKIs against
clinically-relevant EGFR mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Five human NSCLC cell lines were used, namely,
PC-9 [EGFR exon 19 deletion (delE746-A750)], H3255
[EGFR L858R], PC-9ER [EGFR exon 19 deletion
(delE746-A750)+T790M], BID007 [EGFR exon 20
insertion (A763_Y764insFQEA)], and H1975 [EGFR
L858R+T790M]. PC9 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Pasi
Janne (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA).
H3255 and H1975 were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). PC-9ER
cells become resistant to erlotinib after chronic exposure
to erlotinib through acquisition of EGFR T790M second
mutation. BID007 was originally established [20]. Cell
authentication for H1975 and H3255 was performed in
June 2015.

Reagents
Erlotinib and afatinib were purchased from LC
Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). Osimertinib and
rociletinib were purchased from Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX, USA). Total EGFR antibody (#2232),
total AKT antibody (#9272), phospho-AKT (S473; D9E)
antibody (#4060), total p44/42 MAPK antibody (#9102S),
and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (T202/204) antibody

(#9101S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA). Phospho-EGFR (Y1068)
antibody (44788G) was purchased from Invitrogen/Life
Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Actin antibody was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Control cells were treated with the same concentration
of the vehicle, DMSO. We analyzed the apoptotic status
of cells using the Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit
APC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The proportion of apoptotic
cells was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis, using the
Gallios flow cytometer system (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA, USA).

Ba/F3 stable cell lines
Ba/F3 cells stably expressing the wild type and
mutated EGFR were created as previously described [20].
Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR mutations were cultured in
RPMI-1640 growth medium, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR wild type were cultured in
RPMI-1640 growth medium, supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator with EGF (10 ng/mL). The EGFR mutations
examined in this study include delL747_P753insS
(exon 19del), L858R, delL747_P753insS+T790M (exon
19del+T790M), L858R+T790M, A763_Y764insFQEA,
Y764_V765insHH, A767_V769dupASV, and D770_
N771insNPG.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the
GraphPad Prism software, version 4.0 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). IC50 was calculated by
using the GraphPad Prism software.
