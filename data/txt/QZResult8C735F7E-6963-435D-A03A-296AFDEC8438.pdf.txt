Abstract
The peroxiredoxins (Prx) are conserved antioxidant proteins
that use cysteine as the primary site of oxidation during the
reduction of peroxides. Many organisms have more than one
isoform of Prx. Deletion of TSA1, one of five Prxs in yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, results in accumulation of a broad
spectrum of mutations including gross chromosomal
rearrangements. Deletion of TSA1 is synthetically lethal with
mutations in RAD6 and several key genes involved in DNA
double-strand break repair. Here, we have examined the
function of human PrxI and PrxII, which share a high degree
of sequence identity with Tsa1, by expressing them in
S. cerevisiae cells under the control of the native TSA1
promoter. We found that expression of PrxI, but not PrxII, was
capable of complementing a tsa1D mutant for a variety of
defects including genome instability, the synthetic lethality
observed in rad6D tsa1D and rad51D tsa1D double mutants,
and mutagen sensitivity. Moreover, expression of either Tsa1
or PrxI prevented Bax-induced cell death. These data indicate
that PrxI is an orthologue of Tsa1. PrxI and Tsa1 seem to act
on the same substrates in vivo and share similar mechanisms
of function. The observation that PrxI is involved in
suppressing genome instability and protecting against cell
death potentially provides a better understanding of the
consequences of PrxI dysfunction in human cells. The
S. cerevisiae system described here could provide a sensitive
tool to uncover the mechanisms that underlie the function of
human Prxs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):1055–63]

Introduction
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the superoxide anion
.
(O2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (HO ), are
oxygen-derived reactive molecules. ROS are generated as byproducts of normal metabolism, particularly mitochondrial respiration,
and as a result of exposure to various environmental agents (1).
ROS are used as intracellular signaling molecules by pathways
involved in proliferation, stress response, and apoptosis (2, 3).
When ROS levels become too high, oxidative stress results. Failure
to respond to oxidative stress can result in severe damage to lipids,
proteins, and DNA and ultimately lead to cell death. Pathologically

increased ROS generation is linked to various human diseases
(4, 5).
Peroxiredoxins (Prx), previously termed the thioredoxin peroxidases, have received considerable attention in recent years as a
new and expanding family of thiol-specific antioxidant proteins
(6, 7). Prxs are abundant, ubiquitously distributed peroxidases that
use cysteine (Cys) as the primary site of oxidation during the
reduction of peroxides. Many organisms have multiple Prxs, with
five Prxs having been identified in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and six in human cells (6, 7). Prx isoforms are distributed
differently within the cell. Based on structural and mechanistic
data, Prxs can be divided into three subgroups: 2-Cys Prx proteins,
atypical 2-Cys Prx proteins, and 1-Cys Prx proteins. The 2-Cys Prxs,
which contain both the NH2- and COOH-terminal conserved Cys
residues (peroxidatic and resolving Cys, respectively), and require
both of them for catalytic function, constitute the largest class of
Prxs. S. cerevisiae Tsa1 and Tsa2 and human PrxI, PrxII, PrxIII, and
PrxIV belong to the 2-Cys Prx subgroup.
The genetic consequences of deletion of S. cerevisiae genes
encoding the 2-Cys Prxs Tsa1 and Tsa2 and three other Prxs
(cTPxIII, nTPx, and mTPx) have been investigated (8–11). Tsa1 is
the most significant contributor to genome stability and prevents a
broad spectrum of mutations including gross chromosomal
rearrangements (GCR) as well as base substitution and frameshift
mutations (9). Tsa1 is also essential for cell survival in the absence
of functional recombinational repair or the Rad6-mediated
postreplication repair pathway (10). Recombinational repair
involving Rad51 and Rad52 is a key mechanism for repair of
double-strand DNA breaks whereas the Rad6-mediated postreplication repair supports both error-free and error-prone pathways
that bypass replication-blocking DNA lesions (12, 13). The
spontaneous genome instability and cell death associated with
deletion of TSA1 seem to be predominantly due to endogenous
ROS produced by oxygen metabolism (14). These dramatic
phenotypes distinguish Tsa1 from other S. cerevisiae Prxs.
Interestingly, mice lacking PrxI, which is highly homologous to
Tsa1 in amino acid sequence, have increased erythrocyte ROS and
increased risk of developing hemolytic anemia and several
malignant cancers (15).
Given the importance of Tsa1 in maintaining genome stability
and cell survival, and that human PrxI and PrxII are both
cytoplasmic and share a high degree of sequence identity with
Tsa1 (Fig. 1), we have explored the ability of human PrxI and PrxII
to complement a variety of defects caused by a tsa1D mutation.
Our results support the idea that PrxI, but not PrxII, is an
orthologue of Tsa1 and is involved in maintaining genome stability
and preventing cell death. Because PrxI and Tsa1 seem to act on

the same substrates in vivo and share a similar mechanism of
function, the S. cerevisiae system could provide a sensitive tool for
the functional analysis of human Prxs.

Materials and Methods
Gene and protein designations. The human PrxI and PrxII genes are
referred to as PRXI and PRXII, respectively, and the proteins are referred
to as PrxI and PrxII. The homologous S. cerevisiae gene is TSA1, whereas
the protein is Tsa1. The tsa1D is a complete deletion of the TSA1 gene.
Strains in which TSA1 has been replaced by human PRXI or PRXII and
expressed under the control of the TSA1 promoter are designated
tsa1D::PRXI or tsa1D::PRXII, respectively.
Media and strains. S. cerevisiae strains were grown in standard media
including yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (YPD) or synthetic
complete medium (SC) lacking appropriate amino acids as indicated (16).
Cycloheximide-resistant strains (CyhR) containing mutations in the CYH2
gene were selected on YPD agar plates containing 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide.
Canavanine-resistant mutants (Canr) caused by inactivation of the CAN1
gene were selected on SC-arginine dropout plates containing 60 mg/L
canavanine. Canavanine- and 5-fluoroorotic acid–resistant mutants (Canr5FOAr ) that resulted from the loss of the region including CAN1 and URA3
on chromosome V were selected on SC-arginine and -uracil dropout plates
containing 60 mg/L canavanine, 1 g/L 5-fluoroorotic acid, and 50 mg/L
uracil (17).
The strains used for this study were all isogenic to the S288c-based
parental strain RDKY3615 MATa, ura3-52, leu2D1, trp1D63, his3D200,
lys2DBgl, hom3-10, ade2D1, ade8, hxt13::URA3 (17). Gene replacements
were made by standard PCR-based homology-directed methods (16). The
construction of tsa1D::PRXI and tsa1D::PRXII strains in which the entire
TSA1 open reading frame (ORF) was replaced by PRXI or PRXII coding
sequences under the control of the native TSA1 promoter is illustrated
schematically in Fig. 2A. First, the RDKY3615 strain, auxotrophic for
tryptophan and sensitive to cycloheximide (Trp CyhS), was plated on
YPD plates containing 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide to select spontaneous
CyhR colonies. Genetic analysis confirmed that the CyhR phenotype was
caused by a cyh2 mutation, and this cyh2 mutant strain was designated
MEHY1537 (Trp CyhR). Second, a fragment containing the TRP1 and
CYH2 genes flanked by sequences homologous to the upstream and
downstream sequences of TSA1, obtained by PCR amplification of the
TRP1-CYH2 genes present on plasmid p443 (18), was introduced into the
MEHY1537 strain to replace the full TSA1 locus, resulting in strain
MEHY1539 (Trp+ CyhS). Because wild-type CYH2 gene is dominant to the
cyh2 mutation, cells containing wild-type CYH2 gene or both CYH2 and

cyh2 exhibit a CyhS phenotype. Third, cDNA from the EBV-transformed
human lymphoblastoid B cell line D1 (19) was used as a template to
amplify the entire human PRXI or PRXII coding sequence, which was then
cloned between the BglII-KpnI restriction sites of the vector pLitmus28
(Ozyme), resulting in pLitmus28-PRXI and pLitmus28-PRXII. Fragments
containing PRXI or PRXII coding sequences flanked by sequences
homologous to the upstream and downstream sequences of TSA1,
generated by PCR using pLitmus28-PRXI or pLitmus28-PRXII as a
template, were used to transform MEHY1539 (Trp+ CyhS) to replace
TRP1-CYH2 at the TSA1 locus, yielding the strains MEHY1384 (Trp CyhR)
and MEHY1389 (Trp CyhR) in which the PRXI or PRXII coding sequence,
respectively, is under the control of the native TSA1 promoter. Correct
integration of PRXI or PRXII at the TSA1 locus was confirmed by genomic
PCR and by DNA sequencing.
To construct the S. cerevisiae strains expressing influenza virus
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Tsa1, PrxI, or PrxII proteins, we
designed three gene-specific forward oliogonucleotide primers and one
common reverse primer (Fig. 2B). Each of the gene-specific forward
primers has a shared 3¶ end that allows for PCR amplification of a 3HATRP1 cassette in the plasmid pFA6a-3HA-TRP1 (20), as well as a genespecific 5¶ end that allows for precise integration of the amplified cassettes
at the 3¶ end of the genomic coding sequence through homologous
recombination. The common reverse primer has a 3¶ end complementary
to the 3HA-TRP1 cassette for PCR amplification and a 5¶ end homologous
to the downstream sequence of TSA1. These amplified cassettes were
used to transform corresponding strains MEHY1537, MEHY1384, and
MEHY1389 followed by selection on SC-tryptophan dropout plates.
Insertion of the cassette and in-frame fusion of the 3HA tag at the
COOH-terminal end of the coding region of each gene were confirmed by
genomic PCR and sequencing. Sequences of primers used in strain
constructions are available on request.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Wild-type,
tsa1D::PRXI, and tsa1D::PRXII strains were grown to mid-exponential
phase in YPD medium. Total RNA was extracted with acidic phenol (pH 5)
according to an established procedure (21). Extracted RNA was treated
with DNase and verified by conventional PCR to ensure the absence of
trace DNA in samples. cDNA was generated using iScript cDNA synthesis
Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). We designed gene-specific primers for TSA1,
PRXI, PRXII, and ADH1 (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and used as an
internal control). Serial dilutions of cDNA from each strain were amplified
using the appropriate primers and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad).
A single melt curve peak was observed for each sample used in data
analysis, thus confirming the purity and specificity of all amplified
products. The relative ratio of TSA1, PRXI, or PRXII expression to ADH1

blot. PrxI and PrxII proteins were detected with specific anti-PrxI or anti-PrxII antibodies in lysates prepared from the indicated yeast strains and human HeLa cells for

Wild-type and tsa1D strain extracts did not show any immunoreactivity (data not shown). Similarly, anti-PrxII antibody detected a specific band of expected size in
extracts from both the tsa1D ::PRXII strain and HeLa cells (top right ). 3HA-tagged Tsa1, PrxI, and PrxII were detected by anti-HA antibody and alcohol dehydrogenase
(encoded by ADH1 ) served as a loading control (bottom left). For each experiment, the relative levels of Tsa1, PrxI, or PrxII versus alcohol dehydrogenase were
calculated and the ratio of Tsa1 to alcohol dehydrogenase was set as 1, with relative values of other ratios calculated accordingly (bottom right ). Columns, mean of six
independent experiments; bars, SD.

Bio-Rad iQ5 Gene Expression Optical System Software. Sequences of genespecific primers are available on request.
Western blot analysis. Strains were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in
YPD medium and whole-cell extracts isolated by trichloroacetic acid
extraction (22). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford
procedure (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell
extracts were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 12% SDSPAGE minigels and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane that was probed with the following primary antibodies: goat
anti-PrxI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-PrxII (LabFrontier),
mouse anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics), or rabbit anti–yeast alcohol
dehydrogenase (Chemicon International). Corresponding horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody was detected with the
Amersham ECL Western blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare). Human
HeLa cell lysate was extracted and processed as described for S. cerevisiae
cells and used as a positive control in Western blots. Band intensities were
quantitated using ImageJ software.3
Measurement of Canr and GCR rates. The rate of accumulation of
mutations was determined by fluctuation analysis as previously described
(17, 23). For fluctuation analysis of Canr mutations, cells were diluted to
f100 cells/mL in 15 to 34 independent 2-mL YPD cultures per strain,
grown to 1  108 to 2  108 cells/mL, harvested, washed, and
resuspended in sterile water. Appropriate dilutions were plated on
SC-arginine dropout plates containing canavanine to identify mutations
in CAN1, and on YPD for total cell counts. Colonies were counted after
3 or 4 days of growth at 30jC. The number of Canr colonies per culture
was calculated and the median value for each strain was used to
determine the mutation rate as described (24). GCR rates were
determined in the same way except that cultures were 5 to 25 mL,
depending on the strain, and that the washed cells were plated onto SCarginine and -uracil dropout plates containing canavanine and 5fluoroorotic acid and uracil was added. The 95% confidence intervals
for a median rate were calculated based on order statistics.4 Mutation
rates were compared by the Mann-Whitney test.5 Canr mutation spectra
were determined by PCR amplification and sequencing of the CAN1 gene
from independent Canr isolates as previously described (23).

Bax-induced cell death analysis. The URA3 plasmid pCM189Bax expressing human Bax under the control of a Tet-Off promoter
(repressed by the addition of doxycycline) was previously described (25).
A fragment containing the promoter-Bax cassette was isolated from
pCM189-Bax and inserted between the EcoRI-HindIII sites of the
YCplac111 vector (26), generating YCplac111-Bax, which contains a
LEU2 selectable marker. For analysis of Bax-induced cell death, wild-type,
tsa1D, tsa1D::PRXI, and tsa1D::PRXII strains transformed with YCplac111Bax were grown to exponential phase (f2  107/mL) in SC-leucine
supplemented with 10 Ag/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich). Then cells
were harvested, washed, and resuspended at a density of 106/mL
in SC-leucine medium without doxycycline. Samples were removed,
diluted, and plated onto SC-leucine plates supplemented with 10 Ag/mL
doxycycline. The remaining cultures were allowed to grow for an
additional 6 h before plating onto SC-leucine plates supplemented with
doxycycline to repress Bax expression, allowing surviving cells to recover
and grow. The number of living cells in the cultures was estimated by
counting the colonies that had grown after 48 h. Cell survival percentage
is the ratio of the number of colonies obtained in culture after induction
of Bax expression for 6 h to that from the aliquots removed before
induction.

Results
Expression of human PrxI and PrxII in a tsa1D yeast strain.
We sought to develop S. cerevisiae strains that would express the
full-length PRXI and PRXII genes under the control of the native
TSA1 promoter to yield levels of the mature protein comparable
to the physiologic level of Tsa1. The resulting strains, designated
tsa1D::PRXI and tsa1D::PRXII in which the complete TSA1 ORF
(ATG-Stop) was replaced by the PRXI and PRXII coding
sequences, respectively, were constructed as illustrated in Fig.
2A. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays
confirmed that expression of PRXI and PRXII in yeast was
f68% and 77%, respectively, of that of TSA1 (Fig. 2C). The
presence of S. cerevisiae–produced PrxI protein in tsa1D::PRXI
cells and PrxII protein in tsa1D::PRXII cells was detected by
Western blots with specific anti-PrxI and anti-PrxII antibodies,
respectively (Fig. 2D). To compare the protein levels of yeastproduced PrxI and PrxII and native Tsa1, we tagged the COOHterminal ends of Tsa1, PrxI, and PrxII with a 3HA epitope tag,
enabling the immunodetection of these proteins with the same

anti-HA antibody. All three fusion proteins were expressed at a
similar level (Fig. 2D). Taken together, we conclude that the
S. cerevisiae strains tsa1D::PRXI and tsa1D::PRXII produce
corresponding mRNA and proteins that are comparable to the
physiologic level of TSA1 transcript and protein.
PrxI significantly decreases Canr and GCR mutation rates of
a tsa1D mutant. The absence of Tsa1 causes the accumulation of
a broad spectrum of mutations as well as GCRs, indicating that
Tsa1 is a significant contributor to genome stability (9). We first
examined the ability of PrxI and PrxII to complement the mutator
phenotypes of a tsa1D strain by the Canr and GCR assays. The Canr
assay detects inactivating mutations that occur in the 1.8-kb CAN1
gene, including base substitution and frameshift mutations (9, 23).
The GCR assay detects a broad spectrum of genome rearrangements such as translocations, chromosome fusions, large interstitial deletions, and terminal deletions with associated de novo
telomere additions (17). As previously observed (9), deletion of
TSA1 increased the Canr rate and GCR rate compared with a wildtype strain (Table 1). However, the Canr rate and the GCR rate of
the tsa1D::PRXI strain were significantly reduced compared with
the tsa1 mutant (P < 0.01 in both cases; Mann-Whitney test),
although the Canr rate was still higher than that of the wild-type
strain (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). To determine whether PrxI
preferentially suppresses some types of mutation produced in the
tsa1D strain over others, 40 independent Canr mutations arising in
the tsa1D::PRXI strain were sequenced. We found that 70% of Canr
mutations were single-base substitutions, 2.5% double-base substitutions, 20% single-base insertion/deletion mutations (primarily
deletions), 2.5% large deletion mutations, and 5% complex events.
Thus, proportions of the different classes of mutations for the
tsa1D::PRXI strain were similar to those observed in the Canr
mutation spectra of the tsa1D strain that was previously
determined (9). The frequency of each type of single-base
substitution mutation was also determined (data not shown) and
was found to be similar to frequencies of the different types of base
substitution mutations in the Canr mutation spectra of the tsa1D
strain (9). Deletion of TSA1 results in a general increase of various
types of mutations because the rate of each type of mutation,
obtained by multiplying the frequency of each mutation by the
total mutation rate, is generally higher than that in wild-type (9). By
then calculating the rates of occurrence of each of the different
classes of mutations and the different types of base substitution
mutations observed in the tsa1D::PRXI strain and comparing them
to the corresponding rates for the tsa1D strain (9), we determined
that each type of mutation was suppressed from 2.7- to 4.5-fold by
the tsa1D::PRXI allele, indicative of a general suppression of various
types of mutations resulting due to the tsa1D mutation. In contrast
to the tsa1D::PRXI cells, the Canr mutation rate and the GCR rate
of the tsa1D::PRXII cells were not significantly reduced compared
with that of the tsa1D mutant (P > 0.05 in both cases; MannWhitney test), although it cannot be excluded that PrxII has some
minor effect (Table 1).
To confirm the observed effects of PrxI and PrxII on GCR
formation, we incorporated an ogg1 deletion into each strain to
enhance the basal GCR rate and increase the sensitivity of this
assay (10). OGG1 encodes a glycosylase that acts in the base
excision repair pathway by removing 8-oxo-dG from 8-oxo-dG:C
base pairs (27). As previously observed (10), deletion of OGG1 in a
tsa1D strain causes a synergistic increase in the GCR rate
compared with the single mutants (Table 1). Expression of PrxI
largely suppressed the GCR rate of the tsa1D ogg1D strain (P < 0.01,

www.aacrjournals.org

Mann-Whitney test; Table 1). However, the observed rate was still
higher than that of the ogg1D single mutant (P < 0.01, MannWhitney test). Again, the expression of PrxII did not significantly
reduce the GCR rate of tsa1D ogg1D double mutant (P > 0.05,
Mann-Whitney test), although the rate of the tsa1D::PRXII strain
seemed to be slightly lower than that of the tsa1D ogg1D double
mutant. Taken together, these observations indicate that PrxI is
capable of largely replacing the function of Tsa1 with regard to
suppression of genome instability, whereas the effect of PrxII, if any,
is not significant.
PrxI restores cellular viability of rad6D tsa1D and rad51D
tsa1D double mutants. We have previously shown that
combining a tsa1D mutation with rad6D or rad51D mutations,
among others, results in cell death (10). The synthetic lethality of
these double mutants is likely due to excessive ROS-related DNA
lesions that occur in the absence of TSA1, in combination with the
absence of appropriate repair, because anaerobic growth conditions restore viability of these mutants (14). To further assess the
ability of PrxI and PrxII to replace the functions of Tsa1, we tested
their ability to complement the synthetic lethality of rad6D tsa1D
and rad51D tsa1D mutants. Four diploid strains (rad6D/RAD6
tsa1D/TSA1, rad51D/RAD51 tsa1D/TSA1, rad6D/RAD6 tsa1D::PRXI/
TSA1, and rad51D/RAD51 tsa1D::PRXI/TSA1) were sporulated and
dissected, and the spore dissection plates were incubated under

reported (10), a rad6D mutation was found to be lethal in
combination with tsa1D. In contrast, spore products from diploid
strains carrying tsa1D::PRXI showed an increased frequency of
viable spores, indicating complementation. Genotyping of spore
colonies confirmed that rad6D tsa1D::PRXI mutants were viable.

resulted in lethality as previously reported, and this lethality was
entirely restored by expression of PrxI (Fig. 3A and B). Identical
experiments were done with diploid strains containing
the tsa1D::PRXII allele (rad6D/RAD6 tsa1D::PRXII/TSA1 and
rad51D/RAD51 tsa1D::PRXII/TSA1 ) to analyze the effect of
PrxII expression. PrxII was not able to restore the viability of
rad6D tsa1D or rad51D tsa1D double mutants (Fig. 3C). Therefore,
expression of human PrxI, but not PrxII, complements the
synthetic lethality of rad6D tsa1D and rad51D tsa1D double
mutants.
PrxI complements the sensitivity of tsa1D cells to
exogenous oxidant insult. The role of Tsa1 in the protection
of cells against oxidant-induced killing has been investigated,
and in most cases, the tsa1D mutant shows moderately
increased sensitivity to H2O2 (8, 11, 28–30). Antimycin A, a
drug that inhibits respiratory complex III and when used alone
does not affect cell growth, enhances sensitivity of the tsa1D
mutant to H2O2 (30). We therefore compared the sensitivities of
wild-type, tsa1D, tsa1D::PRXI, and tsa1D::PRXII strains to H2O2 in
the presence of antimycin A by the spot assays. The tsa1D strain
was more sensitive to H2O2 plus antimycin A than wild-type

under the conditions tested (Fig. 4), consistent with previously
published results (30). The tsa1D::PRXI cells were more resistant
than the tsa1D mutant to treatment with H2O2 plus antimycin.
Growth of the tsa1D::PRXI strain seemed to be very similar to
wild-type at H2O2 concentrations of up to 1 mmol/L. At levels of
1.5 mmol/L H2O2 and higher, the tsa1D::PRXI strain seemed to be
more sensitive than the wild-type strain, although still considerably less sensitive than the tsa1D strain. In contrast, tsa1D::PRXII
and tsa1D strains showed similar sensitivity to H2O2 plus
antimycin A under the conditions tested, indicating a lack of
complementation by PRXII (Fig. 4).
PrxI and Tsa1 protect S. cerevisiae cells from Bax-induced
cell death. Human PrxI and PrxII are thought to have functions
as inhibitors of cell death (31, 32). Elevated expression of PrxI
has been observed in various human cancers (33). PrxI
suppresses radiation-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)
signaling and apoptosis in lung cancer cells (31). Therefore, we
investigated whether Tsa1, PrxI, and PrxII might protect against
mammalian proapoptotic protein Bax-induced yeast cell death
(34, 35). Expression of Bax was under the control of a Tet-Off
promoter regulated by the presence or the absence of
doxycycline. The wild-type, tsa1D, tsa1D::PRXI, and tsa1D::PRXII
strains with empty vector showed normal survival in the absence
of doxycycline (data not shown). In contrast, induction of Bax
expression for 6 h in these strains reduced viability (Fig. 5). Bax
expression caused a greater reduction in cell survival in a tsa1D
strain. This increased cell death was largely prevented by the
expression of PrxI but not PrxII (Fig. 5). These results indicate

that yeast Tsa1 as well as human PrxI can prevent induction of
apoptosis-like cell death by Bax expression. This correlates with the
inferred role of Prx enzymes during cellular response to oxidative
stress. Of note, accumulating evidence points to ROS as key regulators
of apoptosis, including Bax-induced yeast cell death (36–38).

Discussion
Human PrxI and PrxII share a number of features with
S. cerevisiae Tsa1. First, all three are typical 2-Cys Prxs and their
peroxidase activity relies on both the NH2- and COOH-terminal
conserved Cys residues (6). Second, they are fairly abundant
proteins localized in the cytosol (6). And third, they share high
degree of amino acid identity including the critical catalytic Cys
residues (Fig. 1; refs. 6, 39). Therefore, it was anticipated that the
cellular role of human PrxI or PrxII could be studied in
S. cerevisiae, in which it would be possible for the first time to

examine whether PrxI or PrxII might function in the maintenance
of genome stability and interact with other aspects of DNA
metabolism. The results presented here indicate that the
expression of PrxI largely suppressed the increased rates of
accumulation of mutations and GCRs in tsa1D mutants, suppressed the synthetic lethality interactions seen in rad6D tsa1D
and rad51D tsa1D double mutants, and suppressed sensitivity to
exogenous treatment with H2O2 plus antimycin. In addition,
expression of Tsa1 or PrxI prevented Bax-induced cell death.
Expression of PrxII did not complement tsa1D in any of these
assays. These results indicate that PrxI is the human orthologue
of Tsa1 and that it is functional in S. cerevisiae cells.
PrxI and Tsa1 are functionally almost interchangeable with
regard to maintenance of genome stability in S. cerevisiae, as
expression of PrxI decreased the high rates of Canr mutations
and GCRs in tsa1D mutants. The mechanism of accumulation of
tsa1D-associated Canr mutations, which are primarily base

plates supplemented with 10 Ag/mL doxycycline (Bax repressed). A, representative images show significant reduction in number of colonies after induction of Bax
expression for 6 h. The tsa1D cells displayed a more drastic reduction than wild-type cells following the same treatment. PrxI, but not PrxII, largely suppressed this
reduction. B, for each strain, number of colonies formed from the culture before the Bax expression was set to 100%. The mean survival percentage from the

substitutions (9), seems likely to involve increased oxidation of
DNA in the absence of the antioxidant activity of Tsa1, resulting
in increased misincorporations during DNA replication. The
mechanism underlying the formation of tsa1D-associated GCRs,
which are predominantly broken chromosomes healed by
de novo telomere addition (9), is less clear. It seems likely that
excessive oxidative damage to DNA in tsa1D mutants leads to
the accumulation of damaged replication intermediates, ultimately resulting in broken DNA molecules that are substrates for
some error-prone DNA repair pathways such as de novo
telomere addition (14). The synthetic lethality resulting from
combination of a tsa1D mutation with defects in postreplication
repair or recombination is consistent with such a mechanism
underlying the increased genome instability in tsa1D mutants.
PrxI was initially proposed to be a tumor suppressor based on
its ability to interact with, and modulate the activities of, both
‘c-Myc and c-Abl oncoproteins (40, 41). However, the ability of
PrxI to suppress the mutator phenotype of yeast tsa1D mutants,
which lack equivalents of c-Abl and c-Myc, suggests that the
suppression of mutations and genome rearrangements may be
partially responsible for the role of PrxI as a tumor suppressor.
Increased genome instability could be the driving force of the
increased carcinogenesis seen in PrxI-deficient mice (15).
Human PrxI and PrxII are thought to have functions as
inhibitors of cell death. An antiapoptotic role for PrxI in irradiated
lung cancer cells is thought to be mediated through interaction
with the JNK-glutathione S-transferase pi complex, reducing JNK
release/activation (31). JNK is a critical regulator of cell proliferation, cell survival, cell death, DNA repair, and metabolism (42).
Suppression of PrxII expression by antisense cDNA causes cancer
cells to be more susceptible to radiation-induced apoptosis (32);
this is consistent with the view that radiation-induced cytotoxicity
is mediated primarily by the generation of ROS and ROS-driven
oxidative stress (43, 44). In the present study, we found that the
absence of Tsa1 enhanced Bax-induced cell death and PrxI
suppressed this phenotype, suggesting that Tsa1 and PrxI are
critical regulators of Bax-induced cell death. In contrast, expression
of PrxII did not have such an effect in our system. The ability of
Tsa1 and PrxI to suppress Bax-induced cell death might be due to
their antioxidant activity, suppressing ROS-mediated DNA damage
and genome instability. Another possibility that could explain the
protective effect of Tsa1 and PrxI is that they interfere with ROSmediated signaling in the induction of apoptosis. In fact, although
S. cerevisiae does not contain endogenous Bcl-2 family members,
the initial events underlying Bax activity in S. cerevisiae and
mammalian cells are similar, including translocation of the protein
to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and alterations in
mitochondrial function (36). The downstream effectors of Baxinduced cell death in S. cerevisiae are less well established, but

seem to include ROS generated in the mitochondria. Regardless of
the mechanism, our results suggest that the increased PrxI
expression often observed in various human cancers may inhibit
apoptosis in cancer cells and promote resistance to radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. In agreement with this view, the thioredoxin
system, which is a major intracellular antioxidant activity and an
electron donor for Prxs, has been linked to evasion of apoptosis
and to drug and radiation resistance (45).
Although the 2-Cys PrxI and PrxII share a high degree of
sequence identity and the same catalytic mechanism, our results
suggest differences in their functionality. In contrast to PrxI, PrxII
was not able to functionally substitute for Tsa1. It is possible that
the PrxII expressed in S. cerevisiae was simply not active, although
this seems unlikely given the high degree of sequence identity with
PrxI (77.4% amino acid identity and 90.5% similarity) and the fact
that levels of S. cerevisiae–produced PrxI and PrxII proteins were
quite similar (Fig. 2D). Assuming that PrxII is active in yeast, it is
possible that PrxI is able to interact with a critical endogenous
pathway in S. cerevisiae but that PrxII cannot. Another possibility is
that PrxI and PrxII play distinct cellular roles and possess unique
regulatory mechanisms (46). Indeed, the biological consequences of
the absence of PrxI and PrxII in higher eukaryotes are different.
Notably, PrxI-deficient mice develop malignant tumors in various
tissues (15), whereas PrxII-deficient mice tend to develop only RBC
abnormalities (47). In this regard, it is interesting to note that
S. cerevisiae Tsa1 and Tsa2 share 86% identity in amino acid
sequence but their roles in response to oxidative or nitrosative
stress and in suppressing genome instability are distinct (9, 11,
28, 48). All these data highlight the diverse roles of 2-Cys Prxs in
intracellular H2O2 signaling and oxidative stress. Different Prxs may
direct selective and specific regulation of endogenous H2O2 and
other free radicals depending on the sources and targets in various
physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. The S. cerevisiae
system described here could provide a sensitive tool to help define
the mechanisms that underlie the function of human Prxs.
