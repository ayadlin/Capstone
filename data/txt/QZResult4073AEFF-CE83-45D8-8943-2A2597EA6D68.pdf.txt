SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

B cells foster squamous cell carcinogenesis (SCC) through deposition of immunoglobulincontaining immune complexes in premalignant tissue and Fcγreceptor-dependent activation of
myeloid cells. Since human SCCs of the vulva and head and neck exhibited hallmarks of B cell
infiltration, we examined B cell-deficient mice and found reduced ability to support SCC growth.
Although ineffective as a single agent, treatment of mice bearing pre-existing SCCs with B celldepleting αCD20 monoclonal antibodies improved response to platinum- and taxol-based
chemotherapy. Improved chemo-responsiveness was dependent on altered chemokine expression
by macrophages that fostered tumor infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells via CCR5-dependent

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As the central component of humoral immunity, B lymphocytes function in immunoglobulin
(Ig) production, antigen presentation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. While
critical for combating pathogens and aiding tissue healing, population-based studies have
revealed increased systemic humoral immune responses, including increased deposition of
Ig into tissues, in individuals afflicted with some chronic inflammatory disorders associated
with increased cancer risk. Cancer patients often develop antibodies to tumor-associated
antigens; however, production of these does not necessarily confer protection, but instead
often correlates with poor prognosis and decreased survival for several human cancer types.
Population-based and experimental studies indicate that anti-tumor antibodies can facilitate
tumor growth by promoting protumor immune responses and in general protecting
malignant cells from cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated killing (Gunderson and Coussens,
2013; Tan and Coussens, 2007), thus supporting a role for B cells and humoral immunity in
fostering cancer development. Support for a protumor role for B cells is further provided by
the realization that growth of some subcutaneous solid tumors is retarded in syngeneic B
cell-deficient mice, associated with enhanced local expression of T helper (TH)1 cytokines
and increased infiltration of tumors by CTLs (Qin et al., 1998; Shah et al., 2005; Tadmor et
al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using a transgenic mouse model of de novo squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development
(Coussens et al., 1996), we reported that B cells and humoral immunity foster SCC
development by activating Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) on resident and recruited myeloid cells
(Andreu et al., 2010; de Visser et al., 2005). Rather than infiltrating premalignant skin,
immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting B cells exert distal effects on neoplastic tissue via production
of circulating immune complexes (CIC) that accumulate in premalignant tissue (Andreu et
al., 2010; de Visser et al., 2005). Following CIC engagement of activating-type I and III
FcγRs, tumor progression is fostered through activation of proangiogenic, tissue remodeling
and pro-survival pathways in resident and recruited myeloid cells, in particular macrophages
and mast cells (Andreu et al., 2010). Based on these data, we hypothesized that B cells, and
the downstream myeloid-based pathways they regulate, represented tractable targets for
combinatorial therapy in SCC. We therefore examined the preclinical efficacy of a B celldepleting αCD20 mAb as an anti-cancer monotherapy, and in combination with
chemotherapy (CTX).

B cells in human solid tumors
Unlike squamous carcinoma development in mice wherein premalignant and malignant
tissues are poorly infiltrated by B cells (Andreu et al., 2010; de Visser et al., 2005; Schioppa
et al., 2011), formation of tertiary/ectopic lymphoid structures containing B cells has been
described for several human malignancies, including breast, cervical, ovarian, and non-small
cell lung cancer (Kobayashi et al., 2002; Nelson, 2010). Based upon these data, we
hypothesized that ectopic production of either Ig or CD20 mRNA might signify human
cancers wherein the humoral immune response fosters neoplastic progression or tumor
growth, and thus identify carcinomas potentially amenable to B cell-targeted therapies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To address this, we queried cDNA microarray data on a panel of human tumors from the
BioExpress® System and assessed CD20 (MS4A1) and Ig (IGHG1, IGHG2, IGHV4-31,
IGHM) mRNA expression relative to corresponding normal tissue. Multiple tumor types
displayed increased CD20 or Ig expression as compared to nonmalignant tissue
counterparts, but vulva SCCs and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)
exhibited the greatest increase in CD20 and Ig mRNA expression, respectively (Fig. 1A-B,
S1A), consistent with increased presence of CD20+ B cells in skin, vulva, and head and neck
SCC as revealed by immunodetection (Fig 1C-D). Several Ig and FcR mRNAs were also
found to be differentially expressed in HNSCC tumors relative to normal mucosa based on
evaluation of a previously published dataset (Ginos et al., 2004) using Oncomine (Rhodes et
al., 2004) (Fig. S1B). Notably, etiology for both vulva and HNSCC are in part linked to
human papillomavirus (HPV), with increasing incidence of carcinomas in both reflecting
higher rates of HPV infection (Chaturvedi, 2010; Chaturvedi et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have previously established that progression to carcinoma in a murine model of HPV16induced SCC development (i.e. K14-HPV16 mice) is dependent on binding of Igs to
activating FcγRs on infiltrating myeloid cells (Andreu et al., 2010). Importantly, K14HPV16 mice are not tolerant to HPV oncoproteins (Andreu et al., 2010; Daniel et al., 2005),
reflecting a similar scenario in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer wherein HPV-specific
peripheral blood CD8+ T cells have been described (Albers et al., 2005; Wansom et al.,
2010). We therefore sought to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of B cell-depletion (i.e.
αCD20 mAbs) or inhibition of Fcγ signaling via a selective Syk inhibitor (i.e. fostamatinib/
R788) (Braselmann et al., 2006; Colonna et al., 2010), in either slowing or blocking
progression of premalignant hyperplasia to dysplasia/carcinoma in situ.
Prevention of premalignant dysplasia by B cell-depletion or Syk kinase inhibition
B cells, including mature B cells and plasma cells, accumulate in lymphoid organs of K14HPV16 mice when neoplastic skin is at an early premalignant stage (Fig. S2A-G).
Accordingly, we conducted a prevention trial treating K14-HPV16 mice starting at 1-month
(mo) of age, with αCD20 mAbs to effectively deplete B cells, as well as with the potent Syk
(spleen tyrosine kinase) inhibitor R788/fostamatinib, starting at 1-month (mo) of age when
neoplastic skin exhibited a low-grade hyperplastic state throughout, and continuing to 4-mo
of age when neoplastic skin instead contained focal areas of low/high-grade dysplasia (Fig.

2A). R788 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with potent Syk kinase inhibitory
activity, whose active metabolite (R406) binds the ATP binding pocket of Syk and inhibits
its kinase activity as an ATP-competitive inhibitor (Ki =30 nM) (Bahjat et al., 2008;
Braselmann et al., 2006). Syk plays a key role in signaling downstream of activating FcRs
and B cell receptors (BCR), and in several other cell lineages where activation leads to
phosphorylation (pSyk) and signal transduction via activation of PLCγ and/or AKT.
Notably, expression of mRNAs for both Syk and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), another
key signaling molecule downstream of FcRs and BCRs, were increased in HNSCC tumors
relative to normal mucosa (Fig. S1B). Phosphorylated BTK was also prominent in HNSCC
tissue sections in CD20+ B cells and other stromal cells, as compared to normal mucosa
(Fig. 1C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Administration of αCD20 mAbs to K14-HPV16 mice effectively depleted B cells in
peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs (Fig. S2H-L), including a partial depletion
of CD19+CD1dhiCD5+ B regulatory cells (Fig. S2M), a subset of CD23loCD21hi marginal
zone (MZ) B cells (Fig. S4b) implicated in repressing anti-tumor immunity in two-stage
skin carcinogenesis (Schioppa et al., 2011), and in suppressing lymphoma (Horikawa et al.,
2011). Critically, αCD20 mAb treatment reduced levels of circulating IgG1 (Fig. S2N) and
presence of autoantibodies against collagen I (Fig. S2O), and consistent with a role of CIC
deposition in skin of fostering neoplastic progression via FcγRs, treatment with either
αCD20 mAb or fostamatinib effectively blocked progression to dysplasia in the prevention
trial (Fig. 2B).
Since Ig deposition into neoplastic skin of K14-HPV16 mice becomes pronounced between
2- and 3-mo of age, we also conducted an intervention trial where 3-mo old K14-HPV16
mice with high-grade hyperplasia/low-grade focal dysplasia were treated with αCD20 mAbs
to 6-mo of age, when neoplastic skin exhibited broadly dysplastic regions of focal highgrade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (Fig. 2A). In this setting as well, B cell depletion via
αCD20 mAb as monotherapy blocked progression to dysplasia, and significantly, induced
regression to a hyperplastic phenotype (Fig. 2B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Impaired progression to dysplasia in both trials was associated with significantly reduced
infiltration of neoplastic skin by CD45+ leukocytes (Fig. 2C), encompassing reduced
recruitment of CD11b+Gr1+F4/80−CD11c− immature myeloid cells (iMC), mast cells and
Gr1+ cells, with increased infiltration by CD11b+Gr1− F4/80+CD11c− macrophages, and T
cells (Fig. 2D, S2P-S), similar to results reported for K14-HPV16/B cell-deficient and K14HPV16/FcRγ-deficient mice (Andreu et al., 2010). In addition to limiting mast cell
infiltration, R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib, significantly reduced release of
interleukin (IL)-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL-23, IL-9, and transforming growth
factor (TGF)β from IgG-stimulated bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) in ex vivo
assays (Fig. S2T).
Moreover, similar to results reported for K14-HPV16/B cell-deficient and K14-HPV16/
FcRγ-deficient mice (Andreu et al., 2010), the reduced and altered infiltration by leukocytes
in αCD20 mAb and fostamatinib-treated K14-HPV16 mice was associated with decreased
development of angiogenic vasculature (Fig. 2E), that translated into diminished

keratinocyte hyperproliferation (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that B cell
depletion and Syk kinase inhibition may represent therapeutic opportunities for prevention
and/or intervention in K14-HPV16-positive squamous neoplasms.
B cell-deficient mice fail to support orthotopic SCC tumor growth
Given the increased expression of Ig mRNA in human SCCs (Fig. 1) and efficacy of αCD20
mAb in restricting premalignant progression in K14-HPV16 transgenic mice (Fig. 2), we
next sought to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of B cell-depletion as either monotherapy or
in combination with CTX. For this, we utilized SCC cell lines derived from K14-HPV16
mice (Arbeit et al., 1996) harboring de novo grade I well-differentiated (WDSC1) or poorlydifferentiated SCCs (PDSC5 clone 6). Similar to our results in syngeneic FcRγ-deficient
mice (Andreu et al., 2010), orthotopic SCC growth was significantly reduced in syngeneic B
cell deficient (JH−/−) mice (Fig. 3A-B), characterized by increased presence of CD45+
leukocytes, decreased bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive keratinocytes, increased cleaved
caspase 3-positive cells, and decreased tumor vascularization, along with increased presence
of CD8+ T cells (Fig. S3A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Neoadjuvant αCD20 mAb as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy
These findings provided a compelling rationale for assessing αCD20 mAb in a therapeutic
setting. Thus, we evaluated αCD20 mAb for efficacy in blocking development of syngeneic
SCCs, as compared to slowing or inducing regression of preexistent syngeneic SCCs. Mice
were administered αCD20 mAb either at the time of tumor cell implantation and again at 2
week intervals (d0; q14d), or instead when orthotopic tumors reached ~50 mm3 (d12), and
then q14d (Fig. 3C). Using this strategy, CD19+B220+CD138− mature B cells were
efficiently depleted from lymphoid organs (spleen and bone marrow) (Fig. S3B),
culminating in reduced presence of circulating IgG1 (Fig. S3C). Whereas administration of
αCD20 mAb concurrent with SCC implantation significantly slowed tumor growth to endstage (Fig. 3C, Fig. S3D), accompanied by reduced development of angiogenic vasculature
(Fig. S3E), tumor growth was not significantly slowed when αCD20 mAb therapy was
initiated after tumors were apparent (Fig. 3C, Fig. S3D-E), in spite of a significantly
increased percentage of CD8+ T cells infiltrating tumors (Fig. 3D, Fig. S3E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on the increased presence of CD8+ T cells in orthotopic SCCs of αCD20 mAb-treated
mice we reasoned that efficacy might be enhanced by combination treatment with CTX.
Indeed, treatment of mice bearing pre-existent SCCs with αCD20 mAb in combination with
cisplatin (CDPP) resulted in tumor regression in all animals (Fig. S4A), as compared to
CDPP alone, which was without effect. However, mice treated with αCD20/CDPP exhibited
a 50% survival rate, likely due to cumulative impairment of liver and renal function (Fig.
S4B), a clinically relevant outcome as it mirrors CDPP-associated renal toxicity in cancer
patients administered concomitant rituximab (αCD20 mAb). Due to its reduced
nephrotoxicity, we instead evaluated carboplatin (CBDCA) as an alternative alkylating-type
cytotoxic agent that also had no significant effect on tumor growth alone, but significantly
slowed tumor growth when combined with αCD20 mAb throughout duration of the CTX
cycle (Fig. 4A), without evidence of toxicity or morbidity (Fig. S4B), thus achieving a more
favorable outcome.

To determine if enhanced response to CTX was restricted to platinum-based agents, we next
evaluated the microtubule polymer stabilizer paclitaxel (PTX) in combination with αCD20
mAb, and similarly found significantly slowed SCC growth during the treatment cycle (Fig.
4B), associated with decreased serum IgG1(Fig. S4C). Histological evaluation of tumors
from combinatorial-treated mice revealed reduced malignant keratinocyte proliferation, that
was paralleled by increased cell death (cleaved caspase 3-positivity; Fig. 4C), reduced
angiogenic programming of tumors (CD31+ vessels; Fig. 4C, S4D), with no apparent
change in vascular leakage as measured by Evans blue assay (Fig. S4D).
Given that αCD20 mAb improved responsiveness to PTX, we assessed the durability of
tumor repression after 1 cycle of combined αCD20/PTX therapy, and found that tumor
regrowth was apparent within 10 days following cessation of PTX (Fig. 4D). Since
resistance to cytotoxic agents represents a major limitation of CTX, we evaluated a second
cycle of αCD20/PTX therapy and found that tumors again responded to combined therapy,
but again, that regrowth was evident following cessation of CTX (Fig. 4D).
T cell infiltration in αCD20/PTX-treated tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify cellular mechanisms underlying slowing of tumor growth and increased efficacy
of PTX in αCD20-treated mice, we evaluated leukocyte complexity of orthotopic SCCs by
flow cytometry and found that SCCs responding to αCD20/PTX contained significantly
increased infiltrates of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as compared to tumors that regained
growth kinetics following therapy cessation (Fig. 4D). Increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in
responding tumors from αCD20/PTX-treated mice was not unique to this experimental
setting, as when we analyzed neoplastic skin from 4-mo old K14-HPV16/B cell-deficient,
HK14-PV16/FcRγ-deficient, and K14-HPV16 mice enrolled in the intervention trial with
αCD20 mAbs (Fig. 1), we similarly observed increased presence of CD8+ T cells across all
experimental groups as compared to controls (Fig. 4E). To reveal the functional significance
of increased T cell infiltrates, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were individually depleted from SCCbearing αCD20/PTX-treated mice (Fig. S5A), thus revealing that improved PTX responses
in αCD20 mAb-treated mice were CD8+ T cell-dependent (Fig. 5A), but CD4+ T cellindependent (Fig. S5B). Moreover, depletion of CD8+ T cells reinstated the characteristic
density of CD31+ vessels to growing tumors (Fig. S5C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To reveal molecular mediators regulating productive CD8+ T cell activity, we evaluated
cytokine mRNA expression in SCCs of treated mice and found significantly increased levels
of interferon-alpha (IFNα) and granzyme B (GzmB), molecules involved in regulating CD8+
T cell activity (Fig. 5B). In addition, this analysis revealed increased expression of the
angiostatic molecules angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and CXCL10, consistent with reduced
development of vasculature in tumors from αCD20/PTX-treated mice (Fig. 4C) and our
previous results (Andreu et al., 2010).
Given these findings, we examined if the improved PTX response was due to increased
numbers of CD8+ T cells, or instead to improved functionality of infiltrating CD8+ T cells
by evaluating mRNA expression of SCC infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated by
FACS. Regardless of prior αCD20 treatment, T cells infiltrating SCCs had unchanged

surface expression of activation markers CD69 and CD44 (Fig. S5D), and expressed similar
levels of TH1/TH2/TH17-effectors cytokines (IL-2, -4, -5, -10, -13, 17a-, 17f, IFNγ, TNFα)
and functional indicators of CD8+ T cell killing capability (e.g., GzmA, GzmB, Prf1) (Fig.
S5E). Although changes to a subset of cells would have been masked by our grouped
analysis, these results suggested the improved therapeutic response associated with
αCD20/PTX combined therapy was due to reprogramming of the immune
microenvironment to favor either survival or infiltration of CD8+ T cells that in turn
enhanced tumor cell killing.
Macrophage programming regulates CD8+ T cell recruitment

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given our previous findings that macrophages are functionally reprogrammed to favor a
more TH1-type (classically-activated or ‘M1-type’) inflammatory state in K14-HPV16 mice
lacking either B cells or FcγRs (Andreu et al., 2010), we postulated that αCD20 mAb
therapy was similarly reprogramming macrophages in SCCs of treated mice and that a
macrophage-dependent mechanism differentially regulated CD8+ T cell infiltration. To
investigate this hypothesis, we purified splenic CD8+ T cells (Fig. S5F) and evaluated their
chemotactic response to conditioned medium derived from FACS-sorted
CD11b+Ly6C−Ly6G−F4/80+MHCII+ macrophages isolated from SCCs of αCD20/PTX
versus αRW/PTX-treated mice (Fig. S5G), and revealed a significant increase in CD8+ T
cell recruitment in response to conditioned medium from αCD20/PTX-derived macrophages
(Fig. 5C). mRNA expression analysis of CD11b+Gr1−CD11c−F4/80+MHCII+ macrophages
isolated from SCCs of αCD20/PTX-treated versus mice reveled increased mRNA
expression of several chemokines variably implicated in leukocyte recruitment including
Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl5, Ccl7, and Ccl9 (Fig. 5D), but no significant changes in other genes
associated with macrophage repolarization including Il1b, Il6, Il10, Il12a, Cd163, Msr1,
Arg1, or Ym1 (data not shown). Splenic CD8+ T cells expressed CCR5 (binds CCL3, CCL4
and CCL5) and CXCR3 (binds CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL12) (Fig. S5H) both of which
have been linked to robust anti-tumor responses (Gonzalez-Martin et al., 2011; Hong et al.,
2011). Thus, we evaluated the effect of CCR5- and CXCR3-blockade on CD8+ T cell
chemotaxis ex vivo and found that an αCCR5-blocking mAb alone abated CD8+ T cell
chemotaxis to levels observed with macrophages isolated from SCCs of control αRW/PTXtreated mice (Fig. 5E). Importantly, limiting in vivo tumor infiltration of macrophages with
a neutralizing mAb to colony stimulating factor 1 (αCSF1; Fig S5I) blocked the
combinatorial effect of αCD20/PTX-treatment (Fig. 5F), and restored the density of CD31+
vessels in SCCs to characteristic levels (Fig. S5J). The combinatorial effect of αCD20/PTXtreatment was similarly reversed by depletion of CD8+ T cells, and also by use of the CCR5
inhibitor maraviroc (Fig. 5F), collectively indicating that response to CTX in SCCs is
regulated by CCR5-positive CD8+ T cells responding to macrophages programmed by
humoral immunity (Fig. 6). In support of a central role for CCL5/CCR5 in mediating a
cytotoxic T cell response in SCC patients, we found a significant correlation between
expression of CCL5 and expression of PRF1, GZMA, GZMB, and CD69 (Fig. S5K) in
human HNSCC (Ginos et al., 2004).

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Herein, we provide evidence that therapeutic strategies aimed at depleting B cells and/or
dampening humoral immunity represent tractable targets for anti-cancer therapy in SCC. In
preclinical prevention and intervention trials, treatment of K14-HPV16 transgenic mice with
B cell-depleting αCD20 mAbs or a Syk inhibitor as monotherapy prevented neoplastic
progression to the dysplastic/carcinoma in situ state. While SCC growth was significantly
slowed in either B cell or FcγR-deficient mice (Andreu et al., 2010), treatment of syngeneic
mice bearing preexistent orthotopic SCCs was without consequence following αCD20 mAb
monotherapy. However, when αCD20 mAb was delivered in combination with CTX
(CDPP, CBDCA and PTX), SCC growth was significantly slowed, accompanied by reduced
tumor vascular density and increased T cell infiltration, effects not achieved by
administration of CTX alone. Improved SCC response to CTX in αCD20 mAb-treated mice
were dependent on presence of “reprogrammed” macrophages producing CCR5 ligands,
since depletion of either macrophages or CD8+ T cells restored SCC growth kinetics and
vascular density to characteristic levels. Together, these data indicate that myeloid-based
pathways regulated by humoral immunity limit SCC responses to CTX not only by fostering
tumor angiogenesis, but also by impairing CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumors. Immune
microenvironments in solid tumors can therefore be effectively reprogrammed to elicit
productive anti-tumor immune responses that bolster response to cytotoxic therapy, provided
that specific pro-tumoral immune pathways can be identified and therapeutically targeted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Treatment of solid tumors with CTX, while often useful for palliation or prolonging life in
the setting of advanced disease, remains limited with survival benefit often measured in
months for some tumor types. Having an adjunctive therapeutic option to reverse or
minimize chemo-resistance, or to provide additive benefit through alternate mechanisms
(immuno-modulation) represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. Recent approval of
ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 mAb for use in malignant melanoma (Hodi et al., 2010), and
sipileucil-T, a dendritic cell vaccine that prolongs survival but not disease-free survival in
hormone-refractory prostate cancer (Kantoff et al., 2010; Small et al., 2006), engenders not
only support for immunotherapy in general, but also the concept that immune responses to
cancer can be redirected for therapeutic gain. While neither ipilimumab nor sipileucil-T are
currently approved for use in conjunction with CTX, it is intriguing to speculate that their
efficacy would be improved if administered following CTX, or in combination with
therapies that blunt protumor immunity while also favoring an anti-tumor immune
microenvironment. Results presented herein reveal that these types of responses can indeed
be generated by combining αCD20 mAb with CTX, similarly to that achieved by delivery of
CSF1 antagonists with CTX in mammary carcinomas (DeNardo et al., 2011). While both
modalities slow tumor growth dependent on CD8+ T cells, these improvements are achieved
by distinct molecular mechanisms resulting from lymphoid-based regulation of myeloid cell
programming. These distinctions may reflect organ-specific mechanisms governing immune
response, or nuances of the oncogenic drivers of solid tumor development.
Clinically, vulva and oropharyngeal malignancies are typically of a high-risk HPV viral
etiology (Chaturvedi, 2010), thus K14-HPV16 mice phenocopy neoplastic progression in
these tissues and likely recapitulate a protumorigenic role for B cells and/or humoral

immunity in these locales. This assertion is consistent with results from screening a diverse
assortment of human solid tumors for evidence of B cell infiltration, i.e., CD20 and/or Ig
mRNA expression, wherein vulva and head and neck SCCs contained significantly
increased levels of CD20 and Ig mRNA, consistent with histological evaluation of B cells in
tumor tissue of these cancers, as well as in human cutaneous SCCs. Several other human
tumor types exhibited significant increases in CD20 and/or Ig mRNA as compared to
corresponding normal tissue. B cell-deficient mice have previously been reported to also
resist growth of a range of syngeneic tumors including thymoma, colon, and mammary
(Barbera-Guillem et al., 2000; Inoue et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2005; Tadmor et al., 2011), but
in most instances these studies utilized non-orthotopic subcutaneous implantation. In several
of these models, the pro-tumorigenic role of B cells related to suppression of CD8+ T cell
responses either directly through IL-10 (Inoue et al., 2006; Schioppa et al., 2011; Wong et
al., 2010) or IL-15 (Chapoval et al., 1998), or indirectly through transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β and generation of regulatory T cells (Olkhanud et al., 2011; Tadmor et al., 2011).
Whereas our previous findings indicated a role for Igs and CICs in mediating these effects
(Andreu et al., 2010; de Visser et al., 2005), in other tumor models, adoptive transfer of B
lymphocytes, but not serum, restored tumor growth accompanied by reduced TH1 cytokines
and CTL responses, suggestive of antibody-independent mechanisms (Ammirante et al.,
2010; Shah et al., 2005). Since B cells infiltrate human SCCs, unlike what has been
observed in murine models of HPV16-induced (Andreu et al., 2010; de Visser et al., 2005)
and chemical carcinogenesis-induced (Schioppa et al., 2011) SCCs, we cannot rule out a
potential role in human cancers for other B/plasma cell-derived factors such as granulocytemacrophage (GM)-CSF (Rauch et al., 2012) or lymphotoxin (Moseman et al., 2012), as has
been described for growth of subcutaneous androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer
cells (Ammirante et al., 2010).

B cell-depletion as an adjunct to CTX in solid tumors should be relatively straightforward to
address clinically. Rituximab is already an approved drug for B cell malignancies
(McLaughlin et al., 1998), with no increased susceptibility to infection in patients with adult
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Silverman,
2006). This is likely due to the fact that plasma cells are not depleted by αCD20 mAb
therapy. We observed “normalized” IgG levels in tumor-bearing mice following αCD20
mAb therapy; thus, targeting pathological production of IgG through depletion of short-lived
autoreactive cells without affecting immunity derived from plasma cells could be achieved
in solid tumors, similar to that described for arthritis (Huang et al., 2010) and peripheral
nervous system autoimmunity (Maurer et al., 2012). Although rituximab has few cumulative
side effects and has been combined safely with many CTXs (Gokbuget and Hoelzer, 2006),
it should be noted that rituximab has been reported to increase risk of some solid tumors in
patients with lymphoma also treated with high-dose CTX and stem cell autografts (Tarella et
al., 2011). Alternatively, the clinical success of ibrutinib, an irreversible small molecule
inhibitor of BTK (expressed by both B cells and myeloid cell subsets), engenders support for
the notion that targeting protumoral B cells and humoral immune-activated pathways may
improve overall survival in patients with tumors regulated by these pathways, when
administered in combination with standard-of-care CTX.

While studies presented herein identify SCCs as potentially benefiting from αCD20 mAb/
CTX, the clinical relevance of αCD20 mAb may not be limited to just these solid tumors.
Growth of experimental lung adenocarcinoma is reduced in B cell-deficient mice, with an
improved CTX response observed upon co-administration with IL-15, a TH1 cytokine with
IL-2-like anti-tumor bioactivities (Chapoval et al., 1998). Moreover, in a mouse model of
melanoma, B cell-deficiency provided a therapeutic advantage to a melanoma vaccine where
enhanced tumor protection in the absence of B cells was associated with increased
magnitude and longevity of specific cellular immune responses provoked by vaccination
(Perricone et al., 2004). We also observed a striking increase in Ig expression in human
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples and are currently evaluating whether this
signature translates into a functional role in murine pancreas cancer models. Notably, a
limited clinical study of advanced colon cancer patients treated with rituximab resulted in
reduced numbers of CD21-hyperpositive lymphocytes associated with apparent 50%
reduction in tumor burden with no ill-effects due to therapy (Barbera-Guillem et al., 2000).
Since human SCCs appear to be enriched with tumor promoting B cells, we propose these as
tractable cancers in which to examine efficacy of αCD20 mAb, or other antagonists
blocking protumoral B cell/humoral immunity programs, such as Syk or BTK inhibitors, in
combination with CTX.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Microarray data normalization and integration
Microarray data reflecting CD20 and Ig mRNA in human tumor samples were queried from
a commercially available dataset (BioExpress® System, Gene Logic Inc., Gaithersburg,
MD) originally generated on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
(Affymetrix) and normalized by standard Robust Multichip Average (RMA) procedure. A
single probe set of the highest variance among samples was chosen to represent CD20
(228592_at; MS4A1) and Ig (211430_s_at; IGHG1, IGHG2, IGHV4-31, IGHM),
respectively. To ensure data consistency, results from additional probe sets were compared
to a single probe set. Median value was used to calculate fold change of expression in tumor
tissue compared to normal tissue. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon ranksum test to compare mRNA expression levels to their corresponding normal tissue controls.

Immunohistochemistry
Staining on human tissue sections was performed as described (Ruffell et al., 2012). Deidentified human tissue was received from the UCSF Department of Pathology under
approval from the UCSF Committee on Human Research (05028310), and the OHSU
Department of Dermatology Molecular Profiling Resource (IRB#809), with patient consent
forms obtained at the time of tissue acquisition. The use of samples occurred under “exempt
category 4” for individuals receiving de-identified biological specimens.
Animal husbandry and in vivo studies
Generation and characterization of K14-HPV16 and JH−/− mice have been previously
described (Andreu et al., 2010). Briefly, K14-HPV16 transgenic mice represent a wellcharacterized model of multi-stage epithelial carcinogenesis where human papillomavirus

type 16 (HPV16) early region genes are expressed under control of a human keratin 14
(K14) promoter, i.e., K14-HPV16 mice (Arbeit et al., 1994; Coussens et al., 1996; Coussens
et al., 1999; Coussens et al., 2000; Daniel et al., 2003; de Visser et al., 2004; de Visser et al.,
2005; Rhee et al., 2004; van Kempen et al., 2002). By 1-mo of age, K14-HPV16 mice
develop hyperproliferative lesions (hyperplasias) throughout skin. Between 3-6-mo, these
progress into 100% penetrant focal dysplasias and are predisposed to progress into multiple
histologic grades of SCC in ~50% of mice on the FVB/n strain background, 30% of which
metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Angiogenic vasculature is first evident in hyperplasias,
development of which is linked to infiltration of innate immune cells (de Visser et al., 2004;
de Visser et al., 2005; van Kempen et al., 2002). All experiments with mice complied with
National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the UCSF Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

αCD20 mAB (Clone 5D2; provided by Genentech, Inc.) was generated by immunizing
CD20-deficient mice with a murine pre-B cell line (300.19) transfected with murine CD20.
cDNAs encoding heavy and light chain were cloned from hybridomas and further used for
transfection and antibody production in CHO cells. Ragweed specific mouse IgG2a (αRW
mAb) was used as an isotype control. K14-HPV16 mice received αCD20 (200 μg) or αRW
(200 μg) mAb via i.p. at 2-week intervals commencing at 1 or 3 month of age. Mice bearing
syngeneic orthotopic tumors received αCD20 mAb (200 μg) or αRW mAb (200 μg) either at
the time of tumor cell inoculation (d0) or following appearance of palpable transplantable
tumors (e.g. d12) at 2-week intervals for a total of 3 treatments. K14-HPV16/FcRγ+/− (≥18
mice per cohort) and K14-HPV16/FcRγ−/− (≥10 mice per cohort) mice were fed chow
containing orally soluble fostamatinib (R788) at 2.0 g of fostamatinib per kg of chow, as
compared to control chow (AIN-76A) (Rigel Pharmaceuticals) ad libitum beginning at 1
month of age and continuing for a total of 12 weeks. Formulated chow was prepared by
Research Diets. R406 (R940406) is the active metabolite of fostamatinib that acts as an
ATP-competitive inhibitor (Ki =30 nM), thus selectively inhibiting Syk kinase activity as
assessed using a large panel of Syk-dependent and -independent cell-based assays
(Braselmann et al., 2006). Plasma R406 levels were monitored for 48-, 51-, 54-, 57-, and 58hrs, revealing peak plasma levels at 558 ng/ml in male FVB/n mice and peak levels in
female FVB/n mice at 118.9 ng/ml (data not shown). Thus, using 2.0 mg/ml (10-fold higher
than the tested dose), Syk kinase activity in female FVB/n mice was inhibited in vivo and
was monitored as a function of plasma R406 levels and Syk kinase activity in peripheral
blood leukocytes.
Orthotopic tumor transplantation
PDSC5 and WDSC cells (0.5×106 cells) were suspended in 100 μl of basement membrane
extract Matrigel (BD Pharminogen) in PBS (1:1) and inoculated orthotopically into back
skin of 7 week-old female FVB/n mice. Transplantable tumors were measured at 2-day
intervals using a digital caliper, and tumor volume calculated using the equation: V (mm3) =
a × b2/2, (a = largest diameter; b = smallest diameter). To assess effects of paclitaxel (PTX;
12 mg/kg; Novaplus), cisplatin (CDPP; 10 mg/ kg; Hospira), and carboplatin (CBDCA; 50
mg/ kg; APP Pharmaceuticals) on tumor growth, tumor-bearing mice were pretreated with
αCD20 mAb or αRW mAb as described above. Chemotherapeutic agents were injected

intravenously at 4-day intervals one week following administration of the second dose of
αCD20 or αRW mAb for a total of 3 treatments. Mice were sacrificed 4 days following the
last chemotherapeutic dose. For tumor regression studies, mice were treated with αCD20
mAb/PTX following regrowth of transplantable tumors. Mice received PTX at a 4-day
interval for a total of 3 treatments. For in vivo depletion studies, αCD4 (GK1.5) and αCD8
(YTS169.4) mAb were administered i.p. at 500 μg on day 4 following initial treatment with
αCD20 mAb at a 5-day interval, while αCSF1 (5A1) antibodies (all from Bio X Cell) were
administered i.p. at 1000 μg 4 days prior to the first chemotherapeutic dose, with subsequent
doses of 500 μg every 4 days. Clinical grade maraviroc was dissolved at 300 mg/L in
drinking water for ad libitum dosing (Ochoa-Callejero et al., 2013).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4 and/or InStat version
3.0a for Macintosh (GraphPad Software). Specific tests included Mann-Whitney (unpaired,
nonparametric, two-tailed), unpaired t-test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum, and are identified in the
respective figures. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant with *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 unless otherwise indicated.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The tumor immune microenvironment mediates all aspects of carcinogenesis, targeting of
which is an attractive approach for enhancing traditional and targeted anti-cancer
therapies. Herein, we identified human SCCs associated with high-risk human
papillomaviruses (HPV), as harboring immunoglobulin-producing B cells. Based on this,
we evaluated a murine model of HPV16-regulated SCC for efficacy of B cell-depletion
as monotherapy, and in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. Administration
of CD20 monoclonal antibodies significantly improved response to chemotherapy
dependent on expression of an altered repertoire of chemokines expressed by
macrophages, resulting in increased recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These
results indicate that the immune microenvironment in susceptible solid tumors can be
effectively reprogrammed to foster productive anti-tumor immune responses that bolster
response to cytotoxic therapy.

(A) Two stages of squamous carcinogenesis were evaluated: (i) K14-HPV16 mice were
enrolled at 1 month of age and received αCD20 or isotype control αRW at a 2-week interval
until mice were 4 months of age (Prevention), and (ii) B cell depletion or Syk inhibition was
initiated at 3 months of age at a 2-week interval until mice were 6 months of age
(Intervention). Fostamatinib (R788), an orally bioavailable Syk kinase inhibitor, was
administered through chow ad libitum at 2.0 g/kg/day to HPV16/FcRγ+/− and HPV16/
FcRγ−/− mice at 1 month of age as compared to mice receiving control chow until 4 months
of age. (B) Percentages of ear skin (area) exhibiting dysplasia by 4 or 6 months of age
following αCD20 mAb or fostamatinib administration. Values represent percentages of
dysplastic lesions compared to whole ear skin per mouse with 5-10 mice per experimental
group. Results shown represent mean ± SEM. Representative H&E sections from the
αCD20 mAb intervention study are shown to the right. Scale bars are at 50 μm. (C)
Percentages of CD45+ immune cells in single cell suspensions of skin as assessed by flow
cytometry. Results shown represent mean ± SEM. (D) Immune cell lineage analysis by flow
cytometry as percentages of total CD45+ leukocyte infiltrates in ear tissue. (E) Angiogenic
vasculature in skin of cohorts as evaluated by CD31/PECAM-1 IHC. Values represent
average of five high-power fields of view (FOV) per mouse. (F) Keratinocyte proliferation
in skin of mice cohorts as assessed by automated counting of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)positive keratinocytes per mm2 of premalignant tissue. Data reflects ≥ 3 mice per group with
statistical significance determined via an unpaired t-test with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
0.001. See also Fig. S2.

Figure 6. B cell depletion repolarizes tumor-associated macrophages in SCC

Cartoon showing a putative model for improved chemotherapeutic responses in SCCs
following B cell depletion. Left: During tumor development, autoantibody production by B
cells leads to deposition of immune complexes (IC) within neoplastic tissue. Signaling of
these complexes through activating FcγR activates several protumor pathways, including
angiogenic, tissue remodeling and pro-survival pathways in mast cells and TH2-tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs). Right: αCD20 mAb therapy reduces presence of B cells
and Ig, the absence of which fosters development of TAMs that instead express increased
levels of angiostatic (CXCL10, 11), and CCR chemokines that enhance CD8+ T cell
infiltration of malignant tumors culminating in improved response to chemotherapy. Tumor
growth to end-stage is thereby significantly slowed by enhanced cytotoxic effects on tumor
cells and indirectly through effects on vasculature.
