ABSTRACT
The two transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B are central signaling molecules
in leukemias driven by Abelson fusion tyrosine kinases and they fulfill all criteria of
drug targets. STAT5A and STAT5B display unique nuclear shuttling mechanisms and
they have a key role in resistance of leukemic cells against treatment with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI). Moreover, STAT5A and STAT5B promote survival of leukemic
stem cells. We here discuss the possibility of targeting up-stream kinases with TKI,
direct STAT5 inhibition via SH2 domain obstruction and blocking nuclear translocation
of STAT5. All discussed options will result in a stop of STAT5 transport to the nucleus
to block STAT5-mediated transcriptional activity. In summary, recently described
shuttling functions of STAT5 are discussed as potentially druggable pathways in
leukemias.

STAT5 biology

The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator
of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is highly
conserved throughout evolution. Initial signaling starts
upon ligand binding at the cytokine and growth factor
receptor, emanating a signal from the cell membrane
to the nucleus (Figure 1). The activation of receptorassociated tyrosine kinases – the JAKs – is followed by
activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs
[1]. STAT inactivation is largely carried out by tyrosine
phosphatase action. Moreover, control by suppressor of
cytokine signaling (SOCS), protein inhibitors of activated
STAT (PIAS), signal transducing adaptor molecule
(STAM), Sprouty-related Ena/VASP homology 1-domaincontaining protein (SPRED) and SPROUTY proteins
were described as negative regulators of JAK/STAT
activation [2, 3]. STAT proteins can regulate proliferation,
differentiation, growth and apoptosis [4]. In mammals,
seven different STATs are known which share several
conserved functional domains, but the transactivation
domain (TAD) at the C-terminus is the most diverse part
(Figure 2B).

Only upon ligand binding to the cytokine receptor,
the associated JAK kinase dimer becomes trans-activated
and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic part of the receptor
on distinct tyrosine residues [5]. Newest findings present
a complete model of receptor-linked JAK2 activation
after growth hormone (GH) binding [6]. Once the GH
receptor dimer is activated, the transmembrane helices
rearrange from a parallel to a left-handed cross-over
state. This causes the removal of one JAK2 pseudokinase
domain from the kinase domain of the respective JAK2
binding partner, trans-activation of the kinases and
phosphorylation of the receptor. Another recent study
enlightens the interaction between the JAK kinase,
tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and the interferon-α receptor
(IFNAR1) [7]. Binding to IFNAR1 resembles a SH2-like
phosphopeptide interaction with Tyk2, with a glutamate
replacing the usual phosphotyrosine residue when
co-crystallized. STAT proteins bind via their N-terminus
and SH2 domain to the phosphorylated cytokine

Figure 1: STAT5 – the central signaling node in BCR-ABL1+ leukemia. Canonical activation of STAT5 starts at the
cell membrane with cytokine binding to specific receptors. Receptor dimers undergo conformational changes followed by
pY phosphorylation and activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. JAK2 mediates phosphorylation of the
receptor at the cytoplasmic end at specific sites. STAT5 can bind to the receptors as preformed parallel and anti-parallel
dimers regardless of its phosphorylation status and is activated by JAK2. The activated STAT5 proteins form parallel homoor hetero (STAT5A/A; STAT5A/B; STAT5B/B) dimers via their SH2 domains and translocate to the nucleus to bind to the
DNA. In BCR-ABL1-induced leukemias a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 occurs and results in a constitutive
active cytoplasmic tyrosine fusion kinase. Depending on the break-point within the BCR gene three predominant variants
of the BCR-ABL1 kinase are known: p190BCR-ABL1, p210BCR-ABL1, p230BCR-ABL1. The associated leukemias are shown next to
the different fusion kinases. BCR-ABL1 activity rewires the JAK/STAT signaling in the leukemic cell. STAT5 is directly
pY phosphorylated by BCR-ABL1 which makes JAK2 signaling dispensable. STAT5 tetramers and STAT oligomers (with
activated STAT3 dimers) bind to the DNA and result in elevated target gene expression for the indicated cellular processes
in a leukemic cell.

receptors and crystal structure analysis revealed their
pre-dimerization without the necessity of tyrosine
phosphorylation as parallel/anti-parallel dimers [8].
Tyrosine phosphorylated STATs form efficient dimers
via their SH2 domains and translocate to the nucleus to
bind DNA. The two variants of STAT5 (STAT5A/B) are
activated by more than 20 different cytokines, hormones
and growth factors. Prominent cytokines include
interleukin (IL)-2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21, erythropoietin
(EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), prolactin (PRL), and
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) and GH [5]. Activation is associated with tyrosine
694/699 phosphorylation in human STAT5A/B, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is a prerequisite for stable parallel dimer formation and
initiation of transcription of STAT5-regulated genes [5].
Specific isoforms of STAT5A/B were associated with
human cancer types, but the exact roles for each isoform
in distinct cancer types are not studied yet [4]. Both
proteins are widely expressed, but differences became
also apparent in single knock-out mice. Loss of Stat5a
results in impaired mammary gland development [9],
whereas deletion of Stat5b causes stunted body growth
and NK cell defects [10]. Stat5a/b double knock-out
mice die perinatal on a C57BL/6 and Balb/c genetic
background, but Sv129/C57BL/6 Stat5a/b double
knock-out mice have a compensatory mechanism via

amino acids [105]. So far, somatic mutations in the STAT5B SH2 domain have been described in LGL, T-ALL, T-PLL and HSTL. Asterisks
indicate the GOF mutation position. (B) The C-terminus of STAT5A and B is the most divergent part and shares 78% sequence identity
between the two closely related proteins. Lysines (K- dark blue) nearby and in the tyrosine phosphatase binding domain (light blue) undergo
acetylation or sumoylation, which positively or negatively regulates pYSTAT5, respectively [106]. Apart from tyrosines 694/699 (pink),
serines sites (red) 726/780 in STAT5A are constitutively phosphorylated and crucial for leukemic transformation. As upstream kinases
CDK8 and PAKs have been identified. GOF mutations have been described for S710/S715 in retro virally induced screening methods and
I704 in T-ALL. The transactivation domain (green) is rich in aspartic (D) and glutamic acid (E) forming a highly negatively charged region,
the acidic blob, which interacts with other factors of the transcriptional machinery.

high pYSTAT3 activity and a sub Mendelian fraction of
severely sick mice can survive up to 5 weeks [11]. The
reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT proteins
is regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) of
which 109 different family members are known [12].
SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2
(SHP-2), PTP1-B as well as serine protein phosphatase
2A (PP2A) have been reported to be associated with
STAT5 regulation but it remains largely unknown which
particular phosphatases act on STAT5A/B in specific
cell types [13–15]. Interestingly, serine phosphatase
PP2A-activating drugs were recently found to kill therapyresistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem cells [16].

STAT5 is unmutated and its constitutive activation is a
secondary event and triggered by oncogenic upstream
tyrosine kinases such as BCR-ABL1 (Figure 1). The
requirement of STAT5 in BCR-ABL1+ leukemias for
transformation and disease maintenance has been
well described [21]. Further, the role of the different
STAT5A/B isoforms has recently been addressed,
where in a BCR-ABL1-inducible cellular system,
knock-down of STAT5B sensitized leukemic cells to
imatinib treatment [22] and the attenuation of STAT5A
resulted in enhanced basal oxidative stress and DNA
damage of normal CD34+ and CML cells as well as
growth inhibition of CD34+ cells from patients with
acquired imatinib resistance [23].
CML is a prototype of a myeloid neoplasm where
a single driver mutant, BCR-ABL1, initiates activation
of multiple pro-oncogenic signaling molecules, including
STAT5 [24]. In the chronic phase of CML, BCR-ABL1
is essential for the survival and proliferation of leukemic
cells. In line with this concept, BCR-ABL1-targeting drugs
are able to produce stable complete responses in many
patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+)
CML [25]. Indeed, for these patients, the development
of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) remains
a huge success story. The first active compound with

STAT5, the central signaling node in
BCR-ABL1+ leukemias
Persistent activation of STAT5 is found in many
solid cancers as well as in the majority of hematologic
malignancies [4]. Especially in myeloid malignancies,
the role and oncogenic properties of STAT5 are well
established [17–20]. The role of STAT5 proteins in solid
cancers is less clear due to largely lacking conditional
targeting approaches in appropriate genetic cancer
models. With regard to most hematopoietic cancers,

of BCR-ABL1 mutations [42]. Formal proof for STAT5
as proto-oncogene in hematopoietic diseases was
obtained by retroviral transduction of normal murine
bone marrow (BM) cells followed by transplant with gain
of function (GOF) Stat5 variants. Thus, hyperactivity of
STAT5 as mimicked by expression of a constitutively
activated STAT5A (cSTAT5A) variant suffices to induce a
multilineage leukemia upon transplantation [43].

large clinical applications in CML was imatinib [26]
followed by dasatinib, which binds BCR-ABL1 and other
oncogenic kinases, such as SRC family kinases in both
configurations of inactive or active kinase state [27].
Further TKI improvement came from the higher binding
affinity and selectivity than imatinib through the follow-up
substance nilotinib (AMN107) [28]. In addition, bosutinib
(SKI-606) was developed, a second line inhibitor which
has the broadest target spectrum inhibiting SRC, ABL
and TEC, as well as serine kinases CAMK2G and
STE20, but bosutinib does not target PDGFR and KIT
[29, 30]. Finally, the third line inhibitor ponatinib has been
developed and shown to exhibit substantial efficacy in
patients with CML in whom the polyresistant BCR-ABL1
T315I mutation is expressed in leukemic cells [31].

Somatic mutations of STAT5 on the rise
Since 2013, somatic STAT5B mutations were
discovered in large granula lymphocytic leukemia (LGL)
[44], in T-promyelocytic leukemia (T-PLL) [45], in acute
T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) [46,47] and hepatosplenic T-cell
lymphoma (HSTL) [48], where more mutations can be
expected through progress in the cancer genome project
[200]. Over-expression of the mutated STAT5B versions
resulted in increased transcriptional activity and was
associated with poor disease outcome. Surprisingly and
interestingly, most mutations occur in the SH2 domain
of STAT5B, with the point mutation N642H being the
most frequent. How these mutations might affect nuclear
shuttling of STAT5 is unclear. A graphical scheme of
GOF somatic STAT5B mutations is given in Figure 2A.
In addition, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, STAT5B
translocates and fuses with the retinoic acid receptor
(RAR) alpha with resulting enhanced STAT3-mediated
signaling [49]. cSTAT5A triggers leukemogenesis
through the N-terminus, which regulates STAT5
tetramer formation and oligomerization among multiple
STAT family members [43]. Furthermore, cSTAT5
in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) was shown to be
crucial for development of leukemia and knock-down
of STAT5A was associated with inhibiting growth of
CML CD34+ cell from patients with acquired resistances
towards TKI [23,50]. Interestingly, in leukemic cells,
tyrosine phosphorylated STAT5A (pYSTAT5) not only
localizes in the nucleus but it is also found predominantly
localized in the cytoplasm where it can form a signaling
complex with GRB-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2)
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) leading to protein
kinase B (PKB) activation [51]. It is unclear and hard
to dissect whether the cytoplasmic activity of STAT5
contributes to its oncogenic potential, but studying the
effects of inhibitors of nuclear STAT5 transport could
illuminate the role of cytoplasmic STAT5 in the context
of leukemogenesis.

STAT5 enhances resistance to therapy
Overall, TKI have changed the fate of patients
suffering from BCR-ABL1-driven CML [25] or Ph+ acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite this great success,TKI
are not curative and in most cases medication needs to be
taken life-long to prevent relapse [32]. On the other hand,
CML might be cured with TKI in some cases as shown by
the Stop imatinib (STIM) trial [33]. Within a cohort of 100
patients who were treated with imatinib for at least two
years and had achieved a complete molecular remission
(CMR), the probability to persist in CMR was 41%.
Nevertheless, CML is a chronic hematopoietic disease
derived from transformed long-term hematopoietic stem
cells (LT-HSC) that can act as leukemic stem cells (LSC)
and maintain the disease by signaling via STAT5 [34].
Majoritarian, TKI treatment results in the decimation of
LSC below detection limits but is unable to completely
eradicate the LSC [35]. This TKI resistance can be
explained by the behavior of LSC like non-transformed
stem cells rather than oncogene addicted CML cancer
stem cells [36]. Further, CML stem cells are capable of
autocrine TNF-α production which supports the expression
of IL-3 and GM-CSF receptor and is associated with cell
survival and enhanced proliferation [37]. Moreover, CD25/
IL-2 receptor high expressing CML stem cells were shown
to have a higher capacity to induce leukemia than CD25
negative CML stem cells [38]. Interestingly, a similar
important role for STAT5-regulated CD25 expression as
a leukemic stem cell marker was demonstrated to be a
predictive biomarker in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
for sensitivity of PIM kinase inhibitors [39]. These new
findings further underline the role of STAT5 signaling in
CML or AML stem cells.
15–25% of all patients develop resistance towards
imatinib mostly mediated by point mutations of the
BCR-ABL1 oncogene [40]. In this regard it is of interest
that high levels of STAT5 suffice to enhance imatinib
resistance in CML cells [41]. High STAT5 expression
levels were also shown to correlate with the occurrence

Blocking STAT5 nuclear translocation
Several lines of evidence argue for a critical role
of STAT5A/B in leukemia. Based on the essential role of
these molecules in leukemia evolution and progression,
several targeting approaches have been proposed [52, 53].
We could show that serine phosphorylation of STAT5A is
9567

Oncotarget

a prerequisite for nuclear translocation [54]. Here, we
propose that the inhibition of this transport by direct
or indirect interaction with the transcription factor or
upstream regulators of nuclear import (summarized
in Figure 3) could be a feasible targeting approach.
Unbiased cell-based screens with various smallmolecule compound libraries are one way to identify
new targets of already approved drugs. By employing
STAT5 transcriptional activity and luciferase reporter
assays, pimozide was identified as a potential STAT5
inhibitor in BCR-ABL1+ leukemic cells and in an
AML mouse model [55, 56]. Pimozide was found to
inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, but did
not target BCR-ABL1. The mechanistic details of
STAT5 inhibition by pimozide are unclear but most

likely indirect. A direct interaction between STAT5 and
pimozide was not demonstrated and the use of high
molecular concentrations suggests that the effects of
pimozide on STAT5 might be secondary and not potent
enough to be considered for clinical application [55].
Still it was the first experimental tool to target STAT5 in
clinically relevant cell systems. A current study identifies
the synthetic chalone α-Br-TMC as an inhibitor of
JAK2/STAT5 signaling [57]. Although, cytotoxic effects
are only observed at high concentrations (100 µM) in
cells expressing cSTAT5, tyrosine phosphorylation
of STAT5 and JAK2 was strongly reduced at 10 µM.
STAT5 dependant target gene transcription is altered but
is remains to be determined whether STAT5 inhibition is
direct or a secondary effect.

the presence of Rho GTPases and might travel through the nuclear pore complex assembled to those. Here, targeting Rho GTPases and the
down-stream effectors, PAKs, seem reasonable. Cdc42 is a close homologue of Rho, but it interacts with membranes via post-translational
C-terminal geranylgeranyl lipid modification. It is unclear if Cdc42 is involved in shuttling processes of STAT5 (marked by a ?) and it is
thus not found in the nucleus. SRC-family kinases (SFK) retain pYSTAT5A in the cytoplasm. Thus, targeting SFK could enhance STAT5
nuclear localization, which might not be therapeutically beneficial. (2) Targeting the complex formation of pYSTAT5A in the cytoplasm
with Gab2 and PI3K which lead to PKB activation. (3) JAK2 inhibition targets the canonical signaling and nuclear translocation which
was shown to be relevant in the CML stem cell. (4) Targeting oncogenic Ras which promotes nuclear localization of STAT5 in HSC.

model [70]. Competitive transplantation studies showed
that loss of JAK2 enabled leukemia initiating cells to
outcompete the normal HSC. This again relativizes
the possible benefit of JAK2 inhibition in BCR-ABL1+
leukemia, as the kinase is a critical factor in normal
hematopoiesis. Thus, JAK2 inhibition might affect HSC
and LSC in comparable manner and even abolish the
therapeutic efficacy [71]. Nevertheless, early clinical trials
aim to assess the possibility to combine the JAK2 inhibitor
ruxolitinib in CML patients receiving already treatment
with TKI [201, 202]. A recent study demonstrated
reduction and apoptosis of CD34+ CML cells upon
combined treatment with nilotinib and ruxolitinib, rather
than single application [72]. In the mouse model the
combination of TKI showed toxicity toward healthy HSC,
but to a lesser extent than toward CD34+ CML cells, which
suggested that combinatorial TKI therapy is advantageous
over TKI monotherapy.

The transcriptional activity of STAT5 requires
phosphorylation on tyrosine and parallel dimer formation
via SH2 domains. Inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain of
STAT5B have been identified but very high concentrations
of these compounds were required to induce apoptosis
in lymphoma cells [58]. In a report by the Gunning
group salicylic acid-based small molecules targeting
STAT5 SH2 domain also required high IC50 values to
counteract growth of BCR-ABL1+ cells (20 µM) [59].
The same group improved STAT5 SH2 domain inhibitors
further that now work in vitro in a nanomolar range
(Cumaraswamy et al. 2014 accepted in ACS Medicinal
Chemistry Letters). Of interest is also a STAT3 SH2
domain-targeting compound that showed low micromolar
effects (1 µM) in combination with imatinib on survival
of CD34+ cells obtained from CML patients with BCRABL1-independent TKI resistance [60]. This is of clinical
importance as STAT3 was shown to mediate resistance in
these leukemias.

Controversial: targeting SFK
Other kinases that have been reported to activate
STAT5 in BCR-ABL1+ disease belong to the SRC-family
kinases (SFK). The SFK members HCK and LYN were
found to be highly activated in p210BCR-ABL1 cells [73].
SRC interacts with STAT5 and can phosphorylate STAT5
on tyrosine 694 upon EPO receptor stimulation [74].
Similarly, HCK is capable of phosphorylating STAT5B
in BCR-ABL1-transformed cells [75]. The effects of the
BCR-ABL1 TKI dasatinib, which also inhibits SRC kinase
activity and the dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor bosutinib
on CML stem cells appeared mild and no strong proapoptotic response could be achieved [76,77]. Recently,
the SRC kinases HCK and SRC, but not LYN, were shown
to retain STAT5A in the cytoplasm of BCR-ABL1+ cells
[78]. The significance of this observation is indicative of
a potential negative control of SFK to retain pYSTAT5
in the cytoplasm blocking or causing diminished nuclear
pYSTAT5-induced transcription. Thus, SFKs might balance
the high levels of STAT5 which was shown to associate
pretty much in a 1:1 stoichiometry in K562 BCR-ABL1+
cells to relieve oncogenic stress induced by STAT5 [67,79].
Thus, inhibition of this control mechanism by targeting
SFKs might explain partly why SFK inhibitors failed for
clinical applications since their inhibition could accelerate
pYSTAT5 nuclear translocation.

Up-stream regulator JAK2
The receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2 is
the main activator of STAT5 in hematopoietic cells and
is thus considered an obvious target in JAK-STAT-driven
malignancies. Further, the identification of activating
mutations in JAK kinases in Ph- myeloproliferative
neoplasms, with JAK2 (V617F) being the most frequent
[61–63], has changed therapeutic strategies dramatically.
Moreover, many JAK mutations were shown to be
associated with acute leukemias [64,65]. Indeed,
JAK-targeting TKI have reached the clinics recently,
several of which also target JAK2 with low micromolar
concentration to exert pro-apoptotic effects in CML
cells in vitro (reviewed in [66]). However, BCR-ABL1induced myeloid transformation and disease maintenance
is independent of JAK2 in mouse models and STAT5
is highly activated despite deletion of JAK2 in these
leukemia models [67]. Off-target effects of JAK2 TKI
inhibitors explain this apparent contradiction. Most JAK2targeting TKI are capable of inducing apoptosis not only
in JAK2 wild-type cells but also in JAK2-deficient cells
by inhibiting BCR-ABL1 kinase itself. Transformation
by BCR-ABL1 rewires signaling and BCR-ABL1 itself
phosphorylates and activates STAT5. Another layer of
complexity was introduced by the fact that knock-down
of BCR-ABL1 in CD34+ human CML stems cells fails to
efficiently eradicate these leukemic cells [68]. Reduced
colony formation of CD34+ CML cells in the presence
of dasatinib was complemented upon administration of
cytokines that provide survival signals via JAK2 [69].
On the other hand, the absence of JAK2 dramatically
accelerated disease progression in a BCR-ABL1+ mouse

STAT5 serine phosphorylation
STAT5 harbours serine phosphorylation sites within
the C-terminal TAD, with only partially understood
biological functions (reviewed in [80]). Both, STAT5A and
STAT5B harbour a serine residue at position 725 or 730
within a conserved PSP motif that becomes phosphorylated
upon stimulation with GH, PRL and IL-2 (see graphical

9569

Oncotarget

scheme Figure 2B). Mutation of the conserved serine site
was shown to negatively influence transcriptional activity
of STAT1 and STAT3. Interestingly, human STAT5A has
a unique serine site at position 780 within an LSSP motif.
The role of those serine sites in BCR-ABL1+ leukemia
has recently been clarified. STAT5A is highly serinephosphorylated in human CML cells. Friedbichler et al.
showed that loss of serine 725 and 779 phosphorylation
impaired leukemogenesis induced by cSTAT5A [81]. The
fact that regular hematopoiesis was largely unaffected
placed STAT5 serine phosphorylation into the lime light
of potential target sites.
In fibroblasts, the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor
flavopiridol reduced STAT5 serine 725 phosphorylation
triggered by the growth-factor GM-CSF and knock-down
experiments identified CDK8 as a responsible up-stream
kinase phosphorylating STAT1 on serine 727 [82]. In
leukemias this STAT1 serine site is also critical as natural
killer (NK) cells lacking phosphorylation on STAT1
serine 727 displayed enhanced cytotoxicity and were
capable to eradicate leukemic cells significantly better
when compared to wild-type STAT1-expressing cells [83].
Treatment with CDK8 inhibitors could thus improve
tumor surveillance by enhancing NK cell-mediated
cytotoxicity. Flavopiridol was the first serine/threonine
kinase inhibitor in clinical trials and is currently tested
in clinical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), AML,
and CML trials. A Phase I clinical trial with combination
therapy consisting of imatinib and flavopiridol in CML
and BCR-ABL1+ ALL patients has already been conducted
with considerable success [84].

are essential for the nuclear translocation of STAT
transcription factors in cytokine-induced and oncogenic
(Flt3-ITD) signaling [90,91]. Our recent work bridges the
gap and allows us to understand the mechanistic details
underlying these observations. In particular, STAT5S779
phosphorylation has been identified as a prerequisite
for STAT5A to translocate into the nucleus and nuclear
accumulation of STAT5A is prevented by PAK I group
kinase inhibitors in BCR-ABL1+ leukemias [54]. The
importance of STAT5S779 for nuclear translocation has long
not been recognized perhaps because it has been masked
by endogenous wild-type STAT5 [92–94]. We introduced
a YFP-tagged STAT5S779A mutant into BCR-ABL1expressing HEK 293T cells and observed no accumulation
in the nucleus but an even distribution throughout the cell
[54]. Upon co-transfection with untagged STAT5 wildtype, nuclear accumulation of YFP-tagged STAT5 was
observed. Thus, with a STAT5 molecule with intact S779
within the dimer, transport to the nucleus is possible.
This might also explain why dominant-negative STAT5
lacking the TAD with the serine site 779 is still able to go
nuclear [95]. Further, the massive over-expression might
also promote STAT5 into the nucleus. Human STAT5B
also harbours a serine site at position 779 in the TAD but
it shows essential differences to STAT5A as the motif
is not flanked by prolines (DSQ) [102]. The role of this
phosphorylation site has not been addressed so far. The
mechanistic details of STAT5B translocation to the nucleus
remain unknown, but it is generally accepted that STAT5B
can be transported to the nucleus in a heterodimer with
STAT5A and upon GH stimulation STAT5B homodimers
efficiently go nuclear [96].

Targeting p21-activated kinases

GTPases and STAT cellular shuttling

In BCR-ABL1+ leukemias, STAT5A mutants lacking
serine phosphorylation on S725 and S779 strongly
impaired the viability of the leukemic cells and did not
support transformation by Abelson oncogenes [54].
The mutation of a single serine (STAT5S779A) sufficed to
prolonged disease onset in BCR-ABL1-driven leukemic
mouse model. We identified p21-activated kinases
(PAK) as major up-stream kinases and thus triggers of
pSTAT5S779. Biochemical studies confirmed the direct
interaction and phosphorylation of STAT5S779 by PAK
which required the concomitant presence of the Rho
GTPase family [54]. Further evidence for a key role of
PAK in hematopoietic malignancies stems from a report
on c-kit-induced myeloid neoplasms where PAK acts in
conjunction with Rac kinase to support leukemogenesis
[85]. Interestingly, Rac-dependant signaling has also
been implicated in the signaling cascades downstream
of p210BCR-ABL1 in CML stem and progenitor cells
[86–89]. Rac1 and its up-stream activator MgcRacGAP,
a nuclear localizing signal-containing nuclear chaperone,

STAT proteins were also shown to be able to
undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport through the cell
without being tyrosine phosphorylated (U-STAT), whereas
the re-translocation of pYSTAT from the nucleus back into
the cytoplasm requires its dephosphorylation. In order to
translocate into the nucleus, molecules need to pass the
nuclear pore complex (NPC) which consists of about
30 different proteins, the nucleoporins (Nups) (reviewed
in [97] and [98]). Large proteins such as the STAT proteins
(95-100 kDA) cannot freely pass the NPC. Two modes of
transfer through the NPC have been postulated: (i) carrierindependent transport mediated by direct interaction
with the Nups or (ii) carrier-dependent transport, where
the cargo protein is associated with the transport factors
importins for nuclear import and chromosome region
maintenance 1 (CRM1) protein for export from the
nucleus. The Ras-related nuclear (Ran) proteins are present
in the cell in two nucleotide bound forms: GDP- and GTPbound. The asymmetrical distribution of Ran-GTP, which

9570

is highly concentrated in the nucleus and Ran-GDP, with
high levels in the cytoplasm, drives nuclear shuttling.
Non-tyrosine phosphorylated STAT proteins were shown
to travel by carrier-free transportation mediated by direct
interactions with the Nups as well as through carrierdependant transport out of the nucleus mediated by
interaction with CRM1 [99]. For nuclear export of STAT
proteins, a ternary complex of CRM1-RanGTP with a
Leucine-rich nuclear export signal needs to be formed
in the nucleus and this complex is then disassembled by
GTP hydrolysis by Ran GTPase activating protein in the
cytoplasm. These shuttling processes are dependent on
small GTPase activity which seems to be in line with the
finding that phosphorylation of STAT5A on serine 779
by PAKs requires the presence of members of the Rho
GTPase family which might travel in complex with the
STAT5 proteins through the nuclear pore. This implies
that translocation of STAT5A is regulated by small
GTPases, that can be therapeutically targeted with small
molecule compounds. However, we want to mention that
small GTPases such as oncogenic Ras are difficult to be
targeted due to the high affinity of GTP to small GTPases
[100]. Interestingly, oncogenic Ras was recently linked
to promote enhanced nuclear accumulation of STAT5
in HSC, partly through diminished Socs2 expression
promoting renewal and engraftment under competitive
transplant situation and accelerated growth of HSC
and the myeloid progenitor pool in particular [101].
Inhibitors targeting Rho GTPase family members and their
downstream effectors have been developed [102,103] and
only a few were adopted for clinical use and therefore data
on toxicity in mammals are limited (reviewed in [104]).

cells. Thus, modulation of the irregular signaling in the
cancer cell towards the normal levels is a promising
avenue to target STAT5-dependent leukemia such as
CML.
Formerly, transcription factors like the STAT family
members were considered to be undruggable as they lack
a catalytic activity. Today, there are many possibilities
to target STAT proteins indirectly via interfering with its
up-stream regulators thereby negatively influencing the
nuclear translocation of STAT proteins and inhibiting
their transcriptional activity. The direct inhibition via SH2
domains has been a long discussed issue considering that
formerly developed SH2 domain inhibitors lacked potency
and specificity. However, continuous improvements were
achieved in this field and the development of the first
inhibitor displaying low micromolar antileukemic potency
might soon have consequences for the clinics.

Treatment of TKI-resistant CML is an emerging
challenge in experimental and applied hematology. In fact,
CML LSC exhibit multiple forms of resistance and may
escape treatment with novel TKI. This has accelerated the
search for alternative therapies and drug targets in CML.
As described in this article, STAT5 fulfils all criteria of
a major drug target in BCR-ABL1+ leukemia. However,
there are other potential indications for STAT5 inhibitors.
Notably, STAT5 is important for efficient generation
of many blood lineages and it is essential for proper
immune function. Moreover, it is an important regulator
in function and differentiation of epithelial cell types. It
can be a driver or preventer of solid cancers and STAT5
protein ablation might not turn out favourable, but it was
surprisingly well tolerated in genetic mouse models of
Stat5a/b ablation. The path to therapeutic success might
involve the targeting of modulators such as serine kinases
or small GTPases and interacting proteins of STAT5.
The specific inhibition of components of the aberrant
signaling to which STAT5 is a central mediator can result
in differentiation, growth arrest or apoptosis of leukemic
