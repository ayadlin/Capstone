BACKGROUND. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs) have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly those with tumors that have EGFR-TK domain
mutations. Moreover, the EGFR and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 pathways are known
to enhance the procarcinogenic effects of each other in different tumor types.
Therefore, it was hypothesized that tumor EGFR mutation status may influence
the effectiveness of simultaneous EGFR and COX-2 inhibition in patients with

NSCLC.

METHODS. Three NSCLC cell lines with varying EGFR mutation status and sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs were selected: H3255 (L858R), H1650 (del E746-A750), and
H1781 (wild-type EGFR). Cells were treated with erlotinib, gefitinib, or celecoxib
alone, and the combination of both EGFR-TKI inhibitors with celecoxib. Cell survival and apoptosis was assessed and correlated with the expression of COX-2,
EGFR, pEGFR, Akt, pAkt, expression, and derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).

RESULTS. Celecoxib by itself was found to have no effects on cell growth or apoptosis in any of the cell lines. Erlotinib and gefitinib inhibited cell growth and
induced apoptosis in both mutant cell lines and did so in H1781 cells at 10-fold
higher concentrations. Celecoxib when added to erlotinib or gefitinib significantly
enhanced the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in both mutant cell lines

but had no additional effects in H1781 cells. Greater down-regulation of COX-2,
EGFR, pEGFR, Akt, pAkt, and PGE2 was found when H3255 cells were treated
with the combination compared with any of the single agents alone.

CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study demonstrate that the effectiveness
of the addition of celecoxib to an EGFR-TKI is significantly greater in NSCLC cells
with EGFR mutations, which is likely due to more complete inhibition of both
pathways. Cancer 2007;110:2775–84.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the U.S., with a 5-year survival rate of only 15%.1 Therefore, there is a great need to evaluate novel agents to better treat
this disease. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is expressed in many nonsmall cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs) and is involved in various aspects of carcinogenesis.2
Based on promising preclinical data, the EGFR tyrosine kinase
(EGFR-TKIs) inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib were evaluated
in patients with NSCLC.3–5 Phase 2 studies of these agents

demonstrated a modest response rate of 10% and
median survival of 6 to 8 months. However, these initial trials suggested that the probability of clinical
benefit was greater in patients with certain clinical
characteristics such as nonsmoking status, adenocarcinoma or bronchioalveolar histology, female sex,
and East Asian ethnicity.5–7
Retrospective analyses of tumors of patients treated with EGFR-TKIs revealed that the presence of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the
EGFR gene was predictive of response and clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs.8,9 Subsequently, other investigators have suggested that increased EGFR gene copy
number and EGFR expression may be more predictive
of clinical benefit.10 The importance of each of these
factors in predicting benefit from these agents has varied between the various retrospective analyses and the
true relevance of each factor remains to be determined
in prospective clinical trials. It is interesting to note
that EGFR mutations and increased EGFR gene copy
number occur more frequently in tumors from
patients with clinical characteristics that predict for
increased likelihood of benefit with EGFR-TKIs.10,11
One of the downstream effects of EGFR signaling
is induction of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme.12
COX is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs).13
There are 2 isoforms of COX: COX-1, a constitutive
enzyme expressed in most cells, and COX-2, an inducible isoform of COX that is overexpressed in
inflammatory and neoplastic tissues in response to
various stimuli.12,14–16 COX-2, primarily through the
production of PG, appears to be involved in various
aspects of carcinogenesis.17–20 Many NSCLC tumors
express COX-2 and preclinical evidence suggests that
the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib can inhibit
NSCLC growth.21–23
Because both EGFR and COX-2 appear to be
involved in the carcinogenesis of many epithelial
tumors, there has been an interest in evaluating simultaneous inhibition of both pathways. Preclinical studies have suggested that there is an overlap between
the 2 pathways.12 EGFR signaling induces COX-2
expression and increased prostaglandin production,
whereas COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can
enhance signaling through EGFR.24–26 In addition,
recent studies have shown that COX-2 expression may
result in resistance to EGFR-TKIs.27,28 Preclinical studies have also shown that the combination of EGFR
and COX-2 inhibitors is more effective in inhibiting intestinal tumor formation than either agent alone.29
Based on the relevance of the EGFR and COX-2
pathways in NSCLCs and the overlap between the 2
pathways, we conducted a clinical trial evaluating

the combination of gefitinib plus celecoxib in
patients with recurring NSCLC.30 The overall results
of the study (median survival of 5 months and
response rate of 12%) did not suggest a benefit from
the addition of celecoxib to gefitinib. However, 1
nonsmoking female patient with adenocarcinoma
has had prolonged disease control while receiving
therapy for >3 years. We were unable to determine
the EGFR mutation status of this patient’s tumor due
to lack of adequate tumor specimen. However, her
clinical features make it likely that her tumor harbored an EGFR mutation. Her clinical outcome could
be from the effect of gefitinib alone but her clinical
course raised the possibility that the combination
may produce greater benefit in EGFR mutant NSCLC.
We therefore hypothesized that the overlap between
the EGFR and COX-2 pathways is more prominent in
EGFR mutant tumors than in wild–type tumors and
therefore dual inhibition will produce a greater benefit in tumors with EGFR mutations.
Our results suggest that the combined inhibition
of the EGFR and COX-2 pathways is most beneficial
in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR mutations, with no
additive benefit observed in NSCLC cell line with
wild–type EGFR. Our results also suggest that this
enhanced effect of the combination in the mutant
tumors is a result of more effective inhibition of both
EGFR and COX-2 pathways by the combination than
any of the single agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Reagents
Three NSCLC cell lines with varying EGFR mutation
status and sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs were used: H3255
(L858R; erlotinib IC50 41.72 nM), H1650 (del E746A750; erlotinib IC50 100 nM), and H1781 (wild–type;
erlotinib IC50 >10 mM). H3255 was a generous gift
from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston,
Mass) and were grown in ACL-4 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. H1650 and H1781
were obtained from the American TypeCulture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, Va) and grown in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Gefitinib and erlotinib were generous gifts from
AstraZeneca (Wilmington, Del) and OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, NY), respectively.
Cell Growth Inhibition by MTT Assay
H3255, H1650, and H1781 were seeded at a density of
3000 to 5000 per well in a 96-well plate for 24 hours.
Based on the initial results, the concentration of erlotinib (50 nM and 100 nM), gefitinib (1 nM and 5 nM),
celecoxib (5 mM), and their combination for 72 hours

was chosen for both MTT and apoptosis assays. In
addition, for the nonsensitive cell line H1781, a higher
concentration of erlotinib (10 mM), gefitinib (10 mM),
celecoxib (5 mM), and its combination with celecoxib
5 mM was performed to determine whether any potentiation in growth inhibition was possible. Cell survival
was determined by MTT assay using 0.5 mg/mL of
MTT for 2 hours. The color intensity was measured
with a TECAN microplate fluorometer (Research
Triangle Park, NC) at 595 nanometers (nm).

Quantification of Apoptosis by Enzyme-Linked
Immunoadsorbent Assay
The Cell Death Detection ELISA (enzyme–linked
immunoadsorbent assay) kit (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, Ind) was used to detect apoptosis. Cells
seeded in 6-well plates were treated with erlotinib
(50 nM and 100 nM), gefitinib (1 nM and 5 nM), or
celecoxib (5 mM), and the combination of erlotinib
and celecoxib or gefitinib and celecoxib. In addition,
for the nonsensitive cell line H1781, a higher concentration of erlotinib (10 mM), gefitinib (10 mM), celecoxib (5 mM), and its combination with celecoxib
5 mM was performed to detect any enhanced apoptosis. The cells were lysed and the supernatant fluid
was transferred to an antihistone-coated microtiter
plate. Samples were then incubated with anti-DNA
peroxidase followed by color development with ABTS
substrate. The TECAN microplate fluorometer was
used to measure color intensity at 405 nm.
Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis
H3255 and H1650 cells treated with erlotinib (50
nM), gefitinib (5 nM), or celecoxib (5 mM), and the
combination of erlotinib and celecoxib or gefitinib
and celecoxib for 72 hours was used to evaluate the
effects of treatment on COX-2, EGFR, pEGFR, Akt,
pAkt, and b-actin expression. Cells were lysed in
buffer consisting of 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris buffer
(pH 7.5), 5 mM of ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM sodium
fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovandate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and 1 mg/mL pepstatin for 30 minutes on ice. Protein concentration was
then measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce, Rockford, Ill). The samples were loaded
on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Each
membrane was incubated with appropriate primary
antibodies. The signal intensity was then measured
using chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce).
Autoradiograms of the Western blot analysis were

PGE2 Immunoassay for Quantitation of Prostaglandin E2
Based on the basal level of PGE2, we tested the effect
of treatment on PGE2 level on H3255 and H1781 cells
only. Erlotinib (10 nM), gefitinib (1 nM), and celecoxib (1 nM) were chosen at the lowest concentration possible to see the effect of both of the
combinations. H1781 cells were treated with a higher
concentration of erlotinib (10 mM), gefitinib (10 mM),
and celecoxib (5 mM) to determine whether there
was any decrease in the PGE2 level with the higher
concentration as used in MTT and apoptosis assay.

by celecoxib was observed. No potentiation was observed in H1781 cell line
with any of the drugs or the combination.

The drugs were added for 4 hours and the culture
medium was collected, measured, and analyzed for
PGE2 concentration according to the manufacturer’s
protocol using the PGE2 high sensitivity immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn). The optical density was measured at 450 nm and the
concentration of PGE2 was calculated from the
standard curve. The results are expressed as PGE2 in
pg/106 cells.

Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of treatment outcome were tested for
statistical differences using the Student t test for
paired data. Statistical significance were assumed at
a P-value of .05.

RESULTS
EGFR and COX-2 Expression in NSCLC Cell Lines
The baseline expression of EGFR, pEGFR, Akt, pAkt,
and COX-2 expression in the 3 cell lines is shown in
Figure 1. The expression of E-cadherin and p-STAT3
were also evaluated because previous studies have
shown that these proteins may correlate with EGFR-

TKI activity.28,31 H3255 expressed the highest levels
of COX-2, EGFR, and pAkt, but the lowest levels of Ecadherin, and was the only cell line that expressed pSTAT-3 (Fig. 1A). H1781 expressed low levels of COX2, EGFR, and pAkt, and moderate levels of E-cadherin, but did not express p-STAT-3. H1650 cells
expressed EGFR and the highest level of E-cadherin,
but failed to express COX-2, pAkt, or p-STAT-3.

Determination of Basal Level of PGE2
The baseline level of PGE2, a product of the enzymatic activity of COX-2, was also determined in the
cell lines (Fig. 1B). PGE2 was not detectable in
H1650, a finding that is consistent with nondetectable COX-2 levels in this cell line. PGE2 levels were
detected in both H3255 and H1781 and were higher
in H3255 in concordance with the higher expression
of COX-2 in this cell line.

extent than H3255 cells. No potentiation of apoptosis was observed in the
H1781 cell line.

(1 nM and 5 nM), celecoxib (5 mM), or the combination of erlotinib plus celecoxib (Fig. 2A) or gefitinib
plus celecoxib (Fig. 2B) was determined by the MTT
assay. Single-agent celecoxib had no growth inhibitory activity of its own in any of the cell lines at the
concentration tested. In the H3255 and H1650 cell
lines, the addition of celecoxib to erlotinib or gefitinib resulted in potentiation of the growth inhibition
when compared with erlotinib or gefitinib alone (Fig.
2A and 2B). In H1781, the cell line with wild–type
EGFR, no effects with either the single agents or the
combinations were observed at the concentrations
tested in H3255 and H1650. Therefore, we evaluated
the effects of erlotinib and gefitinib at the higher
concentration of 10 mM with or without celecoxib (5
mM) in these cells. At the 10 mM concentrations, the
EGFR-TKIs induced 50% growth inhibition of 1781

the observed growth inhibition. Erlotinib (50 nM and
100 nM), and gefitinib (1 nM and 5 nM) induced apoptosis in the 2 cell lines with EGFR mutations,
H3255 and H1650, but had minimal effect in H1781
cells with wild–type EGFR (Fig. 3A and 3B). Celecoxib
(5 mM) induced apoptosis in H3255 but was found to
have very minimal effect in H1650 and H1781. However, the addition of celecoxib to either erlotinib or
gefitinib significantly enhanced apoptosis in H3255
and H1650 cells when compared with treatment with
single agents. As with growth inhibition, the
enhancement of apoptosis by the addition of celecoxib was greater in H3255 than in H1650. In the
H1781 cell line, no significant apoptosis was
observed by any single agent treatment or combination. With the IC50 concentration of erlotinib (10 mM)
or gefitinib (10 mM), induction of apoptosis (Figs. 4A
and 4B) was observed in H1781 but it was not
enhanced by the addition of celecoxib.

significant changes in the expression of COX-2,
EGFR, or pAkt were observed after treatment with
any of the single-agent concentrations tested in any
of the 3 cell lines. Celecoxib and erlotinib did reduce
pEGFR levels in H3255 cells. A significant decrease in
the expression of COX-2, EGFR, pEGFR, Akt, and
pAkt protein levels was observed in H3255 cells after
treatment with either of the combinations. In H1650
cells, basal levels of COX-2 and pAkt were not
detected, so the effect of treatment on the expression
of these proteins could not be adequately assessed.
However, no significant effect on EGFR, Akt, and
pEGFR expression was detected in H1650 after treatment with any of the single agents or combinations.
Similarly, no change in any of the protein expression
was observed in the H1781 cell line at the concentrations tested (data not shown).

tions of all 3 drugs chosen for PGE2 assay were very
low compared with either growth inhibition assay or
protein level to determine the differences in drug
combinations. With the lowest concentration of all 3
drugs, a decrease in the PGE2 levels with each of the
single agents and both the combinations were
detected in H3255 cells but not in H1781 cells (data
not shown). The P values were calculated with a Student t test using GraphPad prism software (San
Diego, Calif) and were found to be statistically significant. For H1781 cells (wild–type EGFR cells), a
higher concentration of celecoxib (5 mM) demonstrated a significant decrease in the PGE2 level, but
erlotinib (10 mM), or gefitinib (10 mM) did not appear
to have an effect on the PGE2 levels and the addition
of the EGFR-TKIs did not enhance the effect of celecoxib (Fig. 6B). These studies were not conducted in
H1650 cells because no basal levels of PGE2 were
detected.

harbor activating mutations in the kinase domain of
the EGFR gene. Sordella et al.33 suggested that EGFR
mutant tumors become dependent for survival on
the antiapoptotic signals activated by the mutant
EGFR, a concept that has been termed ‘oncogenic
addiction.’ Therefore, in such cells EGFR-TKIs,
through the inhibition of antiapoptotic signals, can
induce extensive apoptosis and clinical benefit.
Recently, a prospective study of first-line single-agent
erlotinib in patients with NSCLCs that harbored
EGFR mutations reported a response rate of 82%
(13% complete response), results that to our knowledge are unprecedented in the treatment of
advanced NSCLC.34
Our observations in a clinical trial of gefitinib
plus celecoxib led us to speculate that the combination of an EGFR-TKI and a COX-2 inhibitor may be
most beneficial in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. We chose 3
NSCLC cell lines to test our hypothesis. Both H3255,
a cell line with an EGFR mutation in exon 21, and

H1781, with wild–type EGFR, were studied in what to
our knowledge is 1 of the original reports regarding
EGFR mutations.9 We also selected H1650 because it
harbors a different EGFR mutation (del E746-A750)
and is known to be less sensitive to EGFR-TKIs than
H3255.35 This allowed us to evaluate the addition of
celecoxib to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with
varying EGFR mutation status and varying sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs.
Although celecoxib had no single-agent activity,
it enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis when
combined with EGFR-TKIs in both of the EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines despite their varying sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs. The enhanced effect with the
addition of celecoxib was found to be greater in
H3255, the cell line that is more sensitive to EGFRTKIs than H1650 cells. In H3255 cells, both erlotinib
and gefitinib reduced COX-2 and PGE2 levels,
suggesting that EGFR inhibition reduced COX-2 transcription and thus the production of PGE2. Consist-

Synthesis of PGE2 was significantly
reduced with the combination of both
erlotinib and gefitinib with celecoxib in
H3255 cells compared with cells treated with either drug alone. No change
in the PGE2 level was noted in any of
the combinations in H1781 cells.

ent with the prior observation that COX-2 can activate EGFR, celecoxib reduced pEGFR levels in H3255
cells.22 In addition, the levels of EGFR, phosphoEGFR, COX-2, and PGE2 were found to be significantly reduced with the combination than singleagent alone. We could not assess these changes in
H1650 cells because we did not detect COX-2 and
PGE2 expression in this cell line. The changes in protein levels in H3255 cells suggest that the enhanced
effect of the combination in mutant NSCLC cell lines
is a result of more effective inhibition of both EGFR
and COX-2 pathways with the addition of celecoxib
to EGFR-TKIs than any of the single agents.
In H1781 cells, the addition of celecoxib did not
appear to enhance the growth inhibitory or the apoptotic effects of EGFR-TKIs at any concentration of
EGFR-TKIs tested, including the higher concentration
of 10 mM. PGE2 was detected in H1781 cells, but at
levels less than that of H3255 cells. Celecoxib at a
concentration of 5 mM lowered the PGE2 levels. Thus,
despite inhibition of COX-2 activity, celecoxib did not
enhance the effects of EGFR-TKIs. In addition, the
EGFR-TKIs, even at the 10 mM concentration, did not
appear to have any effect on the PGE2 levels in this
cell line with wild–type EGFR. These results suggest
that in the H1781 cells, unlike in H3255 cells, the
combination did not result in greater inhibition of
both pathways than either agent alone. It is possible
that the interdependency of the EGFR and COX-2
pathways is greater in mutant cell lines than in
NSCLC cell lines with wild–type EGFR and this

provides the basis for enhanced inhibition of both
pathways by the combination in the mutant cell
lines. In addition, this interdependency of the 2 pathways may vary in mutant cell lines based on the sensitivity of the tumor cells to EGFR-TKIs. In this
regard, the effects of the combination were more
potent in H3255 cells, the more sensitive cell line,
than in H1650 cells.
These results also suggest that COX-2 expression
or single-agent celecoxib activity do not predict for
the ability of celecoxib to improve the antitumor
effect of EGFR-TKIs. Thus, despite the lack of COX-2
expression in H1650, celecoxib enhanced the antitumor effect of EGFR-TKIs in this cell line, whereas
although H1781 does express COX-2, celecoxib did
not enhance the effect of EGFR-TKIs in H1781. We
speculate that the increased dependency of the mutant cells on the EGFR pathway may increase the
relevance of the overlap that exists between EGFR
and COX-2 pathways and therefore lead to the
enhancement of the antitumor effects of EGFR-TKIs
by celecoxib. This may explain the benefits observed
with the addition of celecoxib in H1650 despite the
lack of COX-2 expression. However, this hypothesis
will have to be confirmed in future experiments.
One of the primary antiapoptotic pathways activated by EGFR is the Akt pathway. In H3255 cells,
the combinations of erlotinib or gefitinib plus celecoxib resulted in significantly greater reduction in
phospho-Akt levels than was observed with erlotinib,
gefitinib, or celecoxib alone. This suggests that the

EGFR-TKI and COX-2 Inhibitor in NSCLC/Gadgeel et al.

dual inhibition is better than the EGFR-TKIs alone at
inhibiting the antiapoptotic signals activated in this
cell line. Thus, the benefit of adding celecoxib to an
EGFR-TKI in this cell line is not just the result of
adding another targeted drug, but appears to be due
to the amplification of the apoptotic signal induced
by EGFR-TK inhibition via the inhibition of an overlapping oncogenic pathway. No changes were noted
in the phospho-Akt levels with the combination in
H1781 cells because an enhanced growth inhibitory
or apoptotic effects were not observed in this cell
line and in H1650, because basal levels of phosphoAkt were not detected.
Reckamp et al.36 recently reported the results of
a phase 1 study evaluating the combination of erlotinib and celecoxib and found the optimal biologic
dose of celecoxib, based on inhibition of urinary
levels of a PG metabolite, to be 600 mg twice daily
when combined with erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg.
This dose is higher than that used in cancer prevention or therapeutic trials to date. The investigators
observed an impressive objective response rate of
33% (7 of 21 patients), suggesting the relevance of
the higher dose of celecoxib for adequate dual inhibition, although responses were observed at dosages
lower than 600 mg twice daily of celecoxib. In addition, of the 7 responders, 5 patients had EGFR mutations. The other 2 responders, whose tumors did not
have EGFR mutations, were never-smokers. In the
large randomized study that documented the clinical
benefit of erlotinib in patients with recurring NSCLC,
the most important factor found to be associated
with benefit was nonsmoking status.32 Based on retrospective analyses, the rate of EGFR mutations in
nonsmokers is approximately 50%.37 It is unclear
whether the higher probability of benefit among
nonsmokers is completely accounted for by the presence of EGFR mutations or whether other factors
make NSCLC in nonsmokers dependent on the EGFR
pathway. Thus, it is possible that in the study by
Reckamp et al. the benefits of dual inhibition were
limited to patients with tumors that have some
degree of EGFR dependency. Those investigators are
planning a phase 2 study of erlotinib (at a dose of
150 mg) and celecoxib (at a dose of 600 mg twice
daily) in patients with advanced NSCLC.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
demonstrate that the addition of celecoxib to EGFRTKIs enhances growth inhibition and apoptosis in
NSCLC cell lines with EGFR mutations but does not
do so in a cell line with wild–type EGFR. We have
also shown that in a mutant cell line the combination showed more effective inhibition of both EGFR
and COX-2 pathways than either agent alone. Our

2783

results suggest that the combination of celecoxib and
EGFR-TKI is likely to be most beneficial in NSCLC
with activating mutations in the EGFR-TK domain.
Our results do not suggest that the combination will
not have any benefit in NSCLC with wild–type EGFR
but that the benefit in these tumors is likely to be
limited to higher concentration of the drugs and that
this benefit is likely to be modest. We plan to conduct animal studies to duplicate our in vitro findings
and we also plan to conduct further in vitro studies
to better define the mechanisms that underlie this
observation.
