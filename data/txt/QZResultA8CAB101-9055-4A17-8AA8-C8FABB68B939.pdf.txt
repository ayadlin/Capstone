ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are emerging as a novel class of antitumor drugs. But the effect of HDACIs in tumors treatment has been disappointing,
which mainly due to the acquisition of resistance to HDACIs. However, the underlying
mechanisms have not been clearly understood. In this study, it was found that
HDACIs SAHA and TSA increased P-gp expression in CRC cells, which has been well
known to contribute to drug resistant. The mechanisms underlying these effects
were investigated. We showed that HDACIs enhanced transcriptional activity of P-gp
protein encoding gene ABCB1. HDACIs treatment also increased the protein and
mRNA expression of STAT3, but not PXR, CAR, Foxo3a or β-catenin, which are known
to be involved in ABCB transcription regulation. Interestingly, knockdown of STAT3
significantly attenuated HDACIs-induced P-gp up-regulation in colorectal cancer cells,
suggesting that STAT3 plays a crucial role in HDACIs-up-regulated P-gp. Furthermore,
this study revealed for the first time that HDACIs enhanced the stability of ABCB1
at post-transcriptional level. Taken together, these results proved that HDACIs
induced P-gp expression by two distinct ways, transcriptional activation and mRNA
stabilization. Our results suggested that more attention should be paid to the cancer
treatment using HDACIs since they will induce multidrug resistance in cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

membrane transport proteins, especially P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) [3].
P-gp, a transmembrane glycoprotein encoded
by the ABCB1 (also called multiple drug resistance
1, MDR1) gene, is the most important member of the
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family. P-gp
is an ATP-dependent efflux pump which decreases the
intracellular concentration of a variety of anticancer drugs
and is involved in the multidrug resistance [4]. Increasing
evidences indicated that the activity and expression of
efflux ABC transporters can be rapidly induced after
exposure to some xenobiotics [5, 6]. The expression of
ABC transporters can be regulated both at transcriptional
or post-transcriptional levels. At transcriptional level,

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the three leading
causes of mortality induced by malignancies in humans
worldwide. Recently, research revealed that the incidence
of CRC in worldwide has obviously increased [1]. The
optimal treatment for CRC is surgical resection, while
chemotherapy servers as a crucial adjuvant therapies for
CRC treatment. Currently, the emergence of multidrug
resistance (MDR), by which cancer cells are resistant to
broad spectrum anticancer drugs, is a major impediment
to the success of CRC chemotherapy [2]. It has been
demonstrated that the development of MDR phenotype
in cancer cells is often attributable to high expression of

two nuclear receptors mainly expressed in the liver,
the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and the constitutive
androstane receptor (CAR), are widely considered to play
a vital role in the regulation of ABCB1 expression [7–9].
Furthermore, other specific ligand-activated transcription
factors, such as STAT3, Foxo3a and β-catenin, have
been proved that could up-regulate mRNA expression of
ABCB1 by directly combined to its promoter [10–12].
Besides transcriptional regulation, ABCB1 has also been
demonstrated can be controlled via post-transcriptional
levels, such as mRNA stability alteration [13, 14].
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are
appreciated as one of novel class of anti-tumor drugs
tested clinically to cure a variety of cancers, including
colorectal cancer. Their anti-tumor activities include
promoting cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis,
and inhibiting angiogenesis [15]. Several HDACIs, such
as Trichostatin A (TSA) and vorinostat (suberolanilide
hydroxamic acid, SAHA) have shown potent anti-tumor
activities [16]. Clinically, SAHA has been approved by
USFDA for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
[17]. As a potent anti-tumor drug, HDACIs have broadspectrum antitumor activity and hypotoxicity in normal
cells [18]. Moreover, HDACIs have been demonstrated
to exhibit synergy with a variety of antitumor drugs,
including cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, paclitaxel and
gemcitabine [19].
Despite HDACIs serve as an emerging class of
potent anti-tumor drug, a few researches have proved
that treatment cancer cells with HDACIs can give rise to
broadspectrum anti-tumor MDR, leading to cells that are
resistant to many functionally and structurally irrelevant
drugs [20]. However, the underlying mechanisms
are not entirely clear. In this study, we showed that
HDACIs SAHA and TSA increased P-gp expression in
HCT116 and SW480 cells. We also demonstrated that
HDACIs enhanced P-gp expression by two distinct ways,
transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization.

can influence transcriptional activity of ABCB1. The
dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that SAHA and
TSA obviously promote ABCB1 promoter transcriptional
activity in HCT116 and SW480 cells compared with
DMSO (Figure 1C).

HDACIs induce drug resistance in CRC cells
To discuss the effect of HDACIs on drug resistance,
MTT assay was performed. HCT116 and SW480 cells
were treated with various concentrations of SAHA or TSA
for 48 h then the cell viability was determined by MTT
assay. As shown in Figure 2A, 0.6 μM SAHA and 100 nM
TSA almost have no effect on cell viability. Further,
HCT116 cells were exposed to various concentrations
of Oxalipatin for 24 h after 48 h treatment with DMSO,
SAHA or TSA and cell viability was determined. We
found that compared to DMSO, treatment with SAHA
and TSA obviously increase drug resistance in HCT116
cells (Figure 2B). To investigate if the increase in P-gp
expression was accompanied by induction of a functional
P-gp, we determined the effect of SAHA and TSA on
the intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine123, a
fluorescent P-gp substrate. As shown in Figure 2C, SAHA
and TSA attenuated the intracellular accumulation of
Rhodamine123. These results indicated that induction of
P-gp expression by SAHA and TSA can efficiently release
drugs from the cells, which lead to the acquirement of
drug resistance.

HDACIs increase the expression of STAT3
We further discussed the underlying mechanism
of HDACIs-induced P-gp expression. As HDACIs can
enhance transcriptional activity of ABCB1, we detected
the expressions of a series of proteins which were reported
can increase P-gp expression by directly binding to the
promoter of ABCB1, such as STAT3, β-catenin, PXR,
CAR, Foxo3a, etc.. The expressions of these proteins
were detected by western blotting in HCT116 and SW480
cells treatment with SAHA and TSA. Interestingly, the
results showed that SAHA and TSA distinctly increase the
expression of STAT3, but not the others (Figure 3A). We
next measured the mRNA expressions of these proteins
in HCT116 and SW480 cells treatment with SAHA and
TSA. Similarly, SAHA and TSA increase the mRNA
level of STAT3, but have no significant effect on the other
proteins (Figure 3B). Based on these results, we assessed
that STAT3 may be crucial for HDACIs-induced P-gp
expression in HCT116 and SW480 cells.

RESULTS
Effect of HDACIs on P-gp expression
P-gp induces the ATP dependent efflux of a variety
of chemotherapeutic agents [21]. To investigate the effect
of HDACIs on P-gp expression, we analyzed the protein
level of P-gp by western blotting in HCT116 and SW480
human colorectal carcinoma cell lines in the presence
and absence of SAHA and TSA. As shown in Figure 1A,
compared to DMSO, treatment with SAHA and TSA
obviously increase the expression of P-gp protein. P-gp
is encoded by ABCB1. We next detected mRNA level of
ABCB1 in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated by SAHA
and TSA. Results in Figure 1B showed that treatment with
SAHA and TSA induce an increase in ABCB1 mRNA
levels. Furthermore, we investigated whether HDACIs

HDACIs increase the activity of STAT3

HCT116 and SW480 with SAHA or TSA respectively

time. The results showed that the mRNA level of STAT3
was enhanced rapidly after SAHA or TSA stimulation and
increased time-dependently (Figure 4A). Before STAT3
transfers into the nucleus to regulate its target gene, it
must be phosphorylated [22]. To determine whether the
activation of STAT3 is influenced by HDACIs, we treated
HCT116 cells with SAHA or TSA for 0.5–6 h, and then
the expression of p-STAT3 were determined by western
blotting. We found that SAHA and TSA increased the
expression of p-STAT3 in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 4B). As a transcription factor, STAT3 can only
take effect when it transfers into the cell nucleus, we
also determined the nuclear translocation of STAT3 by

immunofluorescence. As shown in Figure 4C, compared
with DMSO, SAHA and TSA significantly increased the
nuclear translocation of STAT3.

STAT3 is crucial for HDACIs-mediated P-gp
expression
To further verify the role of STAT3 in HDACIsinduced P-gp expression in colorectal cancer cells, the
siRNAs were used to suppress the expression of STAT3.
HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with siRNAs were
treated with SAHA or TSA and the expressions of P-gp
and STAT3 were detected by western blotting. The results

showed that silencing of STAT3 attenuated HDACIsinduced up-regulation of P-gp, which was not observed
in control si-RNA-transfected cells (Figure 5A and 5B).
Taken together, these observations demonstrated that
STAT3 is essential for HDACIs-induced P-gp expression
in colorectal cancer cells.

a broadspectrum anti-cancer MDR [20]. However, the
underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. In the
present study, we showed that HDACIs SAHA and TSA
increased P-gp expression in CRC cells, which has been
well known to contribute to drug resistant in various cell
lines. Previous studies have showed the up-regulation of
Pgp in cancer cells exposed to HDACIs, including TSA
and VPA [25, 26]. But the molecular mechanisms involved
in HDACIs induced up-regulation of P-gp expression are
not perfectly elucidated. Our study first reported that
HDACIs SAHA and TSA induced P-gp expression by
two distinct ways, transcriptional activation and mRNA
stabilization.
Pgp is a membranebound transporter which can
pump out drug metabolites and natural toxins, as well as
anticancer drugs from the plasma membrane, which in turn
gives rise to drug resistance [27]. We found that SAHA and
TSA increased P-gp protein expression and its encoding
gene ABCB1 mRNA expression (Figure 1A and 1B). Since
transcriptional activation is the most common mechanism
involved in the promotion of ABCB1 gene expression, we
measured transcriptional activity of ABCB1 influenced
by HDACIs. The results of dual luciferase reporter gene
assay showed that SAHA and TSA could obviously
enhance transcriptional activity of ABCB1 (Figure 1C).
Several transcription factors have been characterized and
identified in the regulation of ABCB1 promoter region.
The nuclear receptors PXR and CAR have been proved
that play an important role in ABCB1 gene tanscription
regulation [28, 29] and are cellular biosensors capable of
responding to chemical stimulation [30, 31]. Moreover,
transcription factors β-catenin and Foxo3a have been
reported that could increase ABCB1 mRNA expression by

HDACIs increase the mRNA stability of ABCB1
A recent study found that P-gp expression
in leukemic cells is regulated at two distinct steps,
translational initiation and mRNA stabilization [23].
We have demonstrated that HDACIs can increase
transcriptional activation of ABCB1 (Figure 1C). To
further investigated whether HDACIs can affect the
mRNA stability of ABCB1 in colorectal cancer cells,
HCT116 and SW480 cells were treated with DMSO,
SAHA or TSA for 24 h, after which the transcription
inhibitor actinomycin D (Act-D) was added for the
following 24 h to inhibit nascent RNA synthesis. Then
the ABCB1 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR.
The results showed that SAHA and TSA significantly
enhanced the stability of ABCB1 in HCT116 and SW480
cells compare with DMSO (Figure 6A and 6B).

DISCUSSION
The development of chemoresistance is a main
impediment for any cancer therapy [24]. Despite HDACIs
are known as a novel class of potent anti-cancer agent,
several studies have found that HDACIs treatment can
result in cancer cells resistant to many structurally and
functionally irrelevant drugs, leading to cells acquire

directly combined to its promoter [11, 12]. We investigated
their potential role in the HDACIs-mediated up-regulation
of ABCB1 gene. However, the results of western blotting
and RT-PCR showed that SAHA and TSA treatment

altered neither protein nor mRNA levels of PXR, CAR,
β-catenin and Foxo3a (Figure 2A and 2B), suggesting
that exist other mechanisms involved in up-regulation
of ABCB1 transcription. A recent study demonstrated

that transcription factor STAT3 was involved in the
regulation of ABCB1 transcription by binding with its
promoter region in leukemia cells [10]. Importantly, in
our study, we found that SAHA and TSA treatment not
only markedly increase STAT3 protein expression but also

rapid up-regulate STAT3 mRNA expression in CRC cells
(Figure 2A and Figure 4A). Furthermore, SAHA and TSA
treatment enhanced STAT3 activity in a time-dependent
manner and promoted its nuclear translocation (Figure 3A
and 3B). To investigate the potential role of STAT3 in the

HDACIs-mediated up-regulation of P-gp, STAT3 specific
siRNA was used to knockdown the expression of STAT3.
The results revealed that knockdown STAT3 inhibited
HDACIs-induced up-regulation of P-gp in CRC cells
(Figure 4A and 4B). Taken together, these observations
proved that STAT3 played an important role in HDACIsmediated up-regulation of P-gp in CRC cells. Therefore,
STAT3 can be designed as a target for overcoming MDR
of cancer cells induced by HDACIs in clinical cancer
therapy.
Besides
transcriptional
activation,
posttranscriptional regulation, such as mRNA stability
alternation, was demonstrated to be an important process
in P-gp expression [32]. Previous studies showed that
a few of drugs, including doxorubicin, vinblastine,
etoposide, colchicine and daunorubicin, can promote
ABCB1 gene expression in mammalian cells by enhancing
its mRNA stability [23, 33]. In addition, a recent research
found that TSA could modulate Claudin-1 mRNA
stability in CRC cells [34]. Therefore, we speculated that
HDACIs may regulate ABCB1 mRNA stability in CRC
cells. Interestingly, in our study, the stability of ABCB1
mRNA was indeed significantly enhanced by SAHA and

TSA treatment, suggesting that HDACIs inhibited the
degradation rate of ABCB1 mRNA thus contributing, at
least in part, to the up-regulation of P-gp expression. This
is, to our knowledge, the first study showing that HDACIs
is able to increase ABCB1 mRNA stability. The particular
mechanisms of ABCB1 mRNA stabilization in all of
the above researches are unknown. The mRNA stability
is tightly regulated by the interaction beteewn specific
mRNA sequences and trans-acting factors, such as mRNA
binding proteins and some microRNAs [6, 34]. Recently,
mRNA binding proteins HuantigenR and Tristetraprolin
have been reported play a crucial role in TSA-induced
Claudin-1 mRNA stability [34]. Moreover, microRNAs
have been implicated in the regulation of ABCB1 mRNA
stability [35, 36]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate
that HDACIs may activate a specific trans-acting factor,
which then leading to increased ABCB1 mRNA stability.
It is worth to further elucidate the detailed mechanisms of
HDACIs-mediated ABCB1 mRNA stabilization.
In conclusion, this report found that as a novel class
of anti-tumor drug, HDACIs is able to promote multi-drug
resistance protein P-gp expression in CRC cells. Moreover,
we investigated the underlying mechanisms of HDACIs-

induced P-gp up-regulation, which is mainly via two
distinct ways. On one hand, HDACIs up-regulate STAT3
expression, which then promote transcriptional activation
of ABCB1. On the other hand, HDACIs enhance mRNA
stability of ABCB1. Our results have significant clinical
implications about drug disposition alteration and provide
insight into the potential for development of multidrug
resistance during CRC clinical treatment using HDACIs.

Cell culture

Western blotting analysis

The HCT116 and SW480 colorectal carcinoma cell
