BACKGROUND: Improved outcomes have recently been reported for rituximab (R) plus rituximab plus infusional etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) chemotherapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-associated, aggressive B-cell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The objective of the current analysis was to assess whether
patient selection or other factors contributed to this improvement and to identify patients who are at the greatest risk for lethal
toxicity. METHODS: The authors performed a pooled analysis of 2 consecutive trials that included 150 patients with HIV-associated
NHL who received either R-CHOP (n ¼ 99; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome [AIDS] Malignancy Consortium Trial 010
[AMC010]) or R-EPOCH (n ¼ 51; AMC034). Age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI), CD4 count at lymphoma diagnosis
(<100/lL vs 100/lL), and treatment (R-CHOP vs R-EPOCH) were included as variables in a multivariate logistic regression model
for complete response (CR) and in a Cox proportional hazards regression models for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival
(OS). RESULTS: Features that were associated significantly with an improved CR rate and improved EFS and OS included a low aaIPI
score and a baseline CD4 count 100/lL. When the analysis was adjusted for aaIPI and CD4 count, patients who received concurrent
R-EPOCH had improved EFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.23, 0.69; P < .001) and OS (HR, 0.38; 95% CI,
0.21, 0.69; P < .01). Treatment-associated death occurred significantly more often in patients with CD4 counts <50/lL (37% vs 6%;
P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis provided additional level 2 evidence supporting the use of concurrent R-EPOCH in
patients with HIV-associated lymphoma and a CD4 count >50/lL, and the results support the design of an ongoing phase 3 trial
comparing concurrent R-EPOCH with R-CHOP in immunocompetent patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (National Clinical

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is up to approximately 600-fold greater in individuals with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Despite a decrease in the incidence of HIV-associated NHL since the
advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), NHL remains the most common HIV-associated malignancy in the
United States.1–5
Rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, Calif) is a monoclonal antibody directed against the cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) antigen present on malignant and normal B lymphocytes. Rituximab is a highly effective treatment
for immunocompetent patients with B-cell lymphoma, whether used alone in selected patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with low-grade and aggressive B-cell lymphoma.6,7 It is approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CD20-positive NHL. It has been demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to standard combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy or to CHOP-like regimens significantly improves complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS) rates in patients
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in several trials.8-10 For HIV-associated lymphoma only 1 phase 3 study with
rituximab has been reported. The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Malignancy Consortium (AMC) compared rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) with CHOP alone and observed that the addition of rituximab resulted in fewer
deaths from lymphoma (14% vs 29%; P < .05) offset by a higher infectious death rate (14% vs 2%; P < .05) in the

R-CHOP arm, resulting in comparable rates of CR rates
and OS (AMC Trial 010 [AMC010]).11 Other phase 2
trials in HIV-associated lymphoma have documented
safety and efficacy for R-CHOP,12,13 suggesting that the
addition of rituximab to chemotherapy should be considered the standard of care for most HIV-infected patients
with B-cell lymphomas.14
Several phase 2 trials have suggested that infusional
cytotoxic therapy may be more effective than CHOP in
patients with aggressive B-cell NHL, including immunocompetent15,16 and HIV-positive17,18 patients, whether or
not they receive rituximab concurrently with chemotherapy. In AMC034, patients with HIV-associated, aggressive
B-cell NHL were randomized to receive infusional etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH) chemotherapy either concurrently with
rituximab (R-EPOCH) or followed sequentially by rituximab given weekly for 6 weeks after the completion of
chemotherapy.19 The CR rate was 69% in the concurrent
arm (95% confidence interval [CI], 56%-79%) and 53%
in the sequential arm (95% CI, 41%-64%). In that
randomized ‘‘pick-the-winner’’ phase 2 trial design, the null

hypothesis that the CR rate was 50% versus the alternative
of 75% was rejected for the concurrent arm in favor of the
alternative (P ¼ .005) and was accepted for the sequential
arm (P ¼ .39), suggesting that concurrent R-EPOCH is
more effective than sequential therapy. The objectives of
the current pooled analysis, which included patients who
received concurrent rituximab plus chemotherapy in
AMC010 (R-CHOP) and AMC034 (R-EPOCH), were to
determine whether the apparent benefit of infusional therapy persisted after adjustment of known prognostic covariates and to identify patients at high risk of lethal toxicity
when receiving rituximab plus chemotherapy.

eligibility criteria. HIV positive patients aged 18 years
with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status from 0 to 2 and adequate organ function were
eligible if they had previously untreated, aggressive,
CD20-positive B-cell NHL that was stage II or greater (or
stage I with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level). Both
protocols included Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis and
the use of myeloid growth factors. Meningeal prophylaxis
was administered at the discretion of the treating physician and was recommended for patients at high risk of
central nervous system relapse, as defined previously.11,19
No antibiotic prophylaxis for neutropenia was recommended in AMC010, whereas fluoroquinolones and fluconazole were added in AMC034. Antiretroviral therapy
was mandatory for patients in AMC010 but was left at the
treating investigator’s discretion in AMC034.
Statistical Analysis

We pooled data from 99 patients who received R-CHOP
in AMC010 and 51 patients who received concurrent
R-EPOCH in AMC034. Normally distributed data are

presented as the mean  standard deviation. For univariate associations of variables, means were compared using
the Student t test for normally distributed data and,
alternatively, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.
Proportions were assessed for associations using the Pearson chi-square test or the nonparametric Fisher exact test.
Actuarial graphs for the outcomes event-free survival
(EFS) (defined as time between registration and either
relapse or progression of lymphoma or death from any
cause) and OS were plotted according to the KaplanMeier method. The log-rank test was used to compare the
treatment arms with respect to EFS and OS. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds
ratio (OR) for the outcome complete response (CR)
(defined as confirmed or unconfirmed complete response
[CR/CRu] according to international response criteria20).
Other variables that we included were the age-adjusted
International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) (low-risk score
[0-1] or high-risk score [2-3]), CD4 count (<100/lL or
100/lL), and treatment (R-CHOP or R-EPOCH). A
Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the outcomes EFS and
OS. Test assumptions for all statistical tests were evaluated, and we established that they were not violated. A
P value < .05 was considered statistically significant and
resulted in rejection of the null hypothesis; all statistical
tests were 2-sided. The 95% CI was calculated whenever
applicable. Statistical analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical software package (version 9.2; SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patients

The characteristics of patients from both trials who were
included in this analysis are provided in Table 2. There
were no significant differences in age, sex, CD4 count at
lymphoma diagnosis, or histology between the study
groups, although patients treated on AMC034 tended to
have a higher median CD4 count. The most common
histologic lymphoma subtype in both trials was DLBCL.
Relation Between Treatment and Event-Free
Survival and Overall Survival

We evaluated the relation between treatment and clinical
outcomes without adjustment for CD4 count or aaIPI.
For all patients, R-EPOCH was favored significantly over
R-CHOP for OS (P < .01) (Fig. 1a) and EFS (P < .001)
(Fig. 1b). When stratified by aaIPI, similar benefits were
observed for R-EPOCH in patients with low aaIPI risk
(Fig. 1c,d) and high aaIPI risk (Fig. 1e,f).

Relation Between Treatment and Clinical
Outcomes After Adjustment for Baseline
Covariates by Multivariate Analysis

Results of the multivariate analyses are provided in
Table 3. The OR for achieving a CR was significantly
greater in patients with low-risk aaIPI scores (OR,
4.6; P < .001) and a CD4 count 100/lL (OR, 2.7;
P ¼ 01). There was a trend toward an improved CR
rate for R-EPOCH that was not statistically significant
(OR, 1.9; P ¼ .12). With regard to EFS, the features
associated with a significantly lower HR for 2-year EFS
included both low risk aaIPI (HR, 0.30; P < .001) and
a CD4 count 100/lL (HR, 0.42; P < .001). Low-risk
3980

aaIPI and a high CD4 count also were associated with
significantly improved 2-year OS rates. When adjusted
for these covariates, treatment with R-EPOCH was
associated with significant improvements in the EFS
rate (HR, 0.4; P < .001) and the OS rate (HR, 0.38;
P < .001). In other words, patients who received
R-EPOCH had 60% lower likelihood of death or
progressive lymphoma and 62% lower risk of death
compared with patients who received R-CHOP after
adjusting for the baseline covariates aaIPI and CD4
count. When the analysis was restricted to patients with
DLBCL, similar benefits with respect to CR, EFS, and
OS were observed (Table 4).

Safety

The rate of treatment-associated deaths in both trials is
summarized in Table 5. The treatment-associated mortality rate was 14% for R-CHOP in AMC010 and 9% for
R-EPOCH in AMC034.11,19 Treatment-associated
deaths occurred significantly more often in patients with
CD4 counts <50/lL when the results from both trials
were combined (37% vs 6%; P < .01) and individually
for patients who received either R-CHOP (36% vs 6%, P
< .001) or R-EPOCH (38% vs 5%; P ¼ 02). The cause
of treatment-related death for patients with CD4 counts
<50/lL was cryptosporidiosis, sepsis, and John Cunningham (JC) virus infection in AMC034 (n ¼ 3) and sepsis
syndromes in AMC010 (n ¼ 8).
DISCUSSION
In a pooled analysis of sequentially performed trials for
HIV-associated, aggressive B-cell NHL, we observed
improved clinical outcomes for patients who received rituximab plus infusional EPOCH compared with rituximab plus standard CHOP chemotherapy, including
significantly improved EFS and OS. This benefit likewise
was observed after adjustment for baseline covariates that
were associated with inferior clinical outcomes, including

at least 2 poor-risk IPI features (stage III-IV disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, or poor performance status)
and a low CD4 count (<100/lL) at the time of lymphoma diagnosis. The studies were performed by the
same clinical trials organization and group of clinical
investigators. Antiretroviral therapy was at the discretion
of the treating physician in AMC034 and was used concurrently with chemotherapy in 70% of the patients,
whereas it was mandatory in AMC010. Antibacterial and
antifungal prophylaxis was not required in AMC010 but
was mandatory in AMC034. Other guidelines for supportive care were similar between the 2 studies. These similarities should mitigate the impact of unknown or
unmeasured factors on the improved outcomes we
observed. Moreover, in AMC034, the EPOCH arm followed sequentially by rituximab did not meet the prespecified efficacy endpoint, which was met for patients who
were randomized to receive concurrent R-EPOCH, providing additional evidence that the benefits of concurrent
R-EPOCH indeed were attributable to that specific
3981

therapeutic regimen. Similar benefits for R-EPOCH were
observed in both the low-risk aaIPI group and the highrisk aaIPI group. We also observed that patients who
received R-CHOP or R-EPOCH and had CD4 counts
<50/lL experienced a 35% to 40% rate of treatmentrelated mortality, suggesting that alternative therapeutic
approaches should be considered in this population. For
patients with CD4 counts 50/lL, both regimens were
associated with similar treatment-associated mortality
rates of approximately 5% to 6%, indicating a more favorable therapeutic index for rituximab.
The efficacy of R-EPOCH observed in the multiinstitutional AMC034 trial is also consistent with the
results reported from other trials that were performed at
individual centers. Little and colleagues21 demonstrated a
CR rate of 74% with a progression-free survival (PFS) rate
of 73% and an OS rate of 60% at 53 months in patients
with HIV-associated NHL who received dose-adjusted
EPOCH; the addition of rituximab improved these outcomes in a study by Dunleavy and colleagues,18,22,23 who
reported a CR rate of 92% and 4-year PFS and OS rates
of 86% and 70%, respectively, for patients who received
EPOCH-RR (rituximab on days 1 and 5 of each cycle).
We adjusted our clinical outcome estimates for the 2
strongest predictors of outcome in HIV-associated lymphomas: IPI score and CD4 cell count. The aaIPI is a validated and commonly used index for predicting outcomes
in immunocompetent patients with aggressive NHL,24
and it has also been validated in patients with HIV-associated NHL.25-28 Low CD4 counts consistently have been
associated with poor outcomes in the pre-cART and
cART era.5,27-29 When considered together in the same
patient population, Bower and colleagues observed that
the IPI and the CD4 cell count remained the only independent predictors for mortality in patients diagnosed
with HIV-associated NHL in the cART era,30 supporting
our strategy of including only these 2 baseline covariates
in addition to treatment in our analysis.
The main limitations of our analysis are that patients
were not concurrently randomized to R-CHOP versus REPOCH, and the analysis was conducted in a post-hoc
manner. Although we controlled for the most important
prognostic factors (CD4 count and aaIPI score), the association of R-EPOCH with improved clinical outcomes
compared with R-CHOP still may be secondary to unaccounted confounding factors.
In summary, our finding that the treatment of HIVassociated lymphomas with R-EPOCH results in superior
outcomes compared with R-CHOP is consistent with the
results from other trials assessing the efficacy of these regi3982

mens. These results provide level 2 evidence supporting
the use of R-EPOCH for selected patients with HIV-associated B-cell NHL and a CD4 count 50/lL. Benefits
were observed in both high-risk and low risk patients but
were more pronounced in the high-risk IPI group. Based
on these findings, the ongoing AMC075 trial includes
R-EPOCH as the control arm for patients with HIVassociated DLBCL and high aaIPI risk or other poor risk
features (ie, high Ki67 proliferation rate) by comparing
R-EPOCH alone or in combination with the histone
deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. However, additional confirmation is required in prospective, randomized clinical
trials. Currently, this is the objective of an ongoing effort
led by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), in
which immunocompetent patients with DLBCL are
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either R-CHOP or
R-EPOCH (CALGB 50303; national clinical trials no.
NCT0118209). The results of this trial eventually will
provide level 1 evidence that may define a role for infusional R-EPOCH therapy in DLBCL.
