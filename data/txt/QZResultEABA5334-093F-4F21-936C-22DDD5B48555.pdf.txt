Resistance to BRAF Inhibitors: Unraveling Mechanisms and
Future Treatment Options
Jessie Villanueva, Adina Vultur, and Meenhard Herlyn

Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has emerged as a central target for melanoma therapy
due to its persistent activation in the majority of tumors. Several BRAF inhibitors aimed at curbing MAPK
pathway activity are currently in advanced stages of clinical investigation. However, their therapeutic success is
limited by the emergence of drug resistance, as responses are transient and tumors eventually recur. To develop
effective and long-lasting therapies for melanoma patients, it is essential to understand the mechanisms
underlying resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we briefly review recent preclinical studies that have provided
insight into the molecular mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors and discuss potential strategies to treat
drug-resistant melanomas. Cancer Res; 71(23); 7137–40. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Current therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, offer limited clinical
benefit. Patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis
and a 5-year survival rate of less than 20% (1). In the past
decade, however, the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway began to take center stage in melanoma
therapy because it is commonly activated in tumors through
mutations in BRAF, NRAS, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),
and G-coupled protein receptors, or by growth-factor–mediated stimulation (2, 3). The MAPK pathway regulates many
key biologic processes, including proliferation, survival, and
metastasis, and thus curbing its activity is an attractive
therapeutic endeavor (4). Early efforts were focused on the
development of mutant BRAF inhibitors due to the presence
of BRAF mutations in 50% of melanomas (5). The most
common BRAF mutation (T1799A; BRAFV600E) causes constitutive kinase activity and hyperactivation of the MAPK
pathway, providing a MAPK-relevant, tumor-specific target.
Preclinical and clinical studies have now shown that targeting
BRAF with the use of RAF-selective inhibitors results in
remarkable tumor shrinkage in BRAFV600E melanomas
(4, 6–9). Other activating mutations, such as V600K/D/R, also
seem responsive to BRAF inhibitors (10). In a recent phase III
trial in which patients with BRAFV600E melanomas were
treated with the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032/
RG7204), 48% of the patients had confirmed objective

responses and 84% showed increased overall survival compared with those treated with dacarbazine (64%) at 6 months
(11). Despite these encouraging results, responses to RAF
inhibitors are transient, resistance to these compounds develops, and tumors invariably recur. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors is now critical
to maximize their clinical success; achieve complete, durable
responses; and improve patient outcomes.
Resistance to targeted agents, a frequent cause of therapy
failure, can be mediated by diverse mechanisms, including
secondary mutations or epigenetic changes in the target gene,
modifications in drug metabolism, and activation of compensatory pathways, leading to increased tumor cell survival.
Investigators are only now beginning to unravel what mechanisms are at play as a result of RAF inhibition and when are they
engaged.

Modeling Resistance to BRAF Inhibitors—Key
Findings
Our group and others have been intensively investigating
the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to BRAF
inhibitors using a variety of approaches (12–14). In our
studies, we modeled the emergence of resistance to BRAF
inhibitors by selecting a panel of BRAFV600E/PTENþ melanoma cells that are highly sensitive to BRAF inhibition and
chronically exposing them to increasing doses of SB-590885
(GlaxoSmithKline), a BRAF-selective inhibitor (15). Drug-resistant cells emerged 6 months after persistent drug exposure and were able to proliferate and survive in the continuous
presence of 1 mmol/L of SB-590885, unlike their parental
counterparts. Of importance, chronic BRAF inhibition led
to cross-resistance to several BRAF-selective inhibitors, including PLX4032, indicating that resistance is not likely to be
easily overcome by switching to a new RAF inhibitor. All
resistant clones were able to proliferate at normal rates, retain

their anchorage-independent growth, and grow in a 3-dimensional tumor-like microenvironment even in the presence of
high doses of BRAF inhibitors.
Although a frequent mechanism of anticancer drug resistance is the development of secondary mutations in the target
gene, we did not identify secondary mutations in BRAF in any
of our resistant cell lines, all of which retained the BRAFV600E
mutation. Biochemically, our resistant melanoma cells were
able to reactivate the MAPK pathway in a BRAF-independent
manner. Although the parental (BRAF-inhibitor–sensitive)
cells rely on BRAF for MAPK activation, the BRAF-inhibitor–resistant cells had somewhat elevated expression of CRAF
and ARAF, and were able to dynamically use either of these 2
RAF isoforms to sustain MAPK activity and promote proliferation. Nevertheless, the resistant cells were still sensitive to
MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors that target downstream of
RAF (Fig. 1). Treatment of BRAF-inhibitor–resistant cells with
various structurally different MEK inhibitors had mostly
cytostatic effects, suggesting that additional bypass mechanisms could be promoting survival. Indeed, our resistant cells
displayed differential activation of several RTKs, in particular
insulin-like growth factor receptor I (IGF-IR). Although the
parental melanoma cells, like all cells of melanocytic origin,
express IGF-IR, some of our BRAF-resistant melanomas
expressed higher surface levels of IGF-IR. We observed that
treatment of parental cells with BRAF inhibitors led to a
decrease in phospho-IGF-IR levels; however, phosphorylation

of IGF-IR was sustained in our BRAF-inhibitor–resistant cells.
We further noted that enhanced IGF-IR–mediated signaling
was not due to amplification or mutations of the IGF-IR gene.
Even though the precise mechanisms of enhanced IGF-IR
expression and signaling in the context of chronic BRAF
inhibition are not yet completely understood, our results
suggest possible cross-talk between BRAF and RTKs (particularly IGF-IR–dependent networks) that requires further investigation.
IGF-IR plays an important role in survival and resistance to
anticancer therapies (16) that may be mediated through
activation of MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling. In the context of resistance to BRAF inhibition,
we found that IGF-IR promotes activation of PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT, but it has no effect on the MAPK pathway.
Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of IGF-IR inhibited only
downstream PI3K/AKT signaling; exogenous IGF-I increased
PI3K-mediated signaling but was not sufficient to induce
resistance. Additionally, the MAPK and PI3K pathways
seemed to jointly regulate the levels of the antiapoptotic
factor Mcl-1 to promote survival. Clearly, the MAPK and
IGF-IR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways cooperate to promote
the survival and expansion of BRAF-inhibitor–resistant
cells. Validating this conclusion, we found that coinhibition
of these 2 pathways induced apoptosis of BRAF-inhibitor–
resistant cells more effectively than did inhibition of
each individual pathway. The combination of MEK

inhibitors (e.g., GSK1120212 or AZD6244) with PI3K inhibitors
(e.g., GSK2126458) or IGF-IR inhibitors led to striking cytotoxic effects in 3-dimensional BRAF-inhibitor–resistant melanoma spheroids. Our findings strongly support the potential
use of these combinatorial approaches to treat patients who
are refractory to BRAF inhibitors.
To assess the clinical relevance of our studies, we compared
paired biopsies (pretreatment and postrelapse) in 5 patients
with metastatic melanoma treated with PLX4032. All 5
patients initially responded to PLX4032 but relapsed after 4
to 15 months of treatment. Sequencing of all 5 paired tumor
biopsies indicated that the mutation encoding BRAFV600E
was present in all samples (pretreatment and postrelapse), but
no secondary mutations in BRAF, CRAF, or RAS were identified. Through immunohistochemical analysis of these biopsies, we found increased levels of IGF-IR in the postrelapse
samples of 2 patients, 1 of which also had increased levels of
phosphorylated AKT. These findings are consistent with our in
vitro data suggesting that enhanced IGF-IR expression and
PI3K/AKT activity are associated with resistance to BRAF
inhibitors in some patients. We also noted a homozygous loss
of PTEN and increased pAKT levels in the postrelapse biopsy
of 1 patient, suggesting that PTEN loss could also be linked to
resistance to BRAF inhibitors in some patients; however, it is
not likely to be the sole player. These findings need to be
further investigated both in vitro and in clinical samples.

Multiple Resistance Mechanisms Can Bypass
BRAF Inhibition
Because melanoma is a complex and heterogeneous disease
composed of biologically, genetically, and histopathologically
distinct subtypes, it is not surprising that multiple mechanisms
of resistance can compensate for chronic BRAF inhibition.
Unlike other malignancies in which the development of secondary or "gatekeeper" mutations in the target gene is a common
mechanism of resistance, so far no secondary mutations have
beenidentifiedinBRAF-inhibitor–resistantmelanomas,despite
the use of highly sensitive sequencing methods such as nextgeneration targeted deep and ultradeep sequencing (13, 14).
Notwithstanding the fact that a diverse array of molecular
mechanisms seem to be linked to acquired resistance to BRAF
inhibitors, which poses a challenge for clinical translation,
some common mechanistic themes have emerged (12–14). In
most instances, reactivation of the MAPK pathway is required
to circumvent chronic BRAF inhibition and resume proliferation; therefore, the MAPK pathway remains a good therapeutic target. Our studies support this observation and show
that melanoma cells, which are initially addicted to BRAF, can
switch and use one of the other RAF isoforms (ARAF or CRAF)
to reactivate the MAPK pathway and continue proliferating.
Additionally, overexpression of CRAF or the MAP3K8 COT can
also lead to MAPK reactivation (14). Alternatively, treatment
with BRAF inhibitors could select for minor, preexistent NRAS
mutant clones that do not respond to BRAF inhibitors but
paradoxically hyperactivate the MAPK pathway (17–20). In
fact, Nazarian and colleagues (13) identified 2 different NRAS
mutations (Q61K and Q61R) in 1 of 12 patients resistant to

vemurafenib. Persistent addiction to MAPK despite BRAF
inhibition renders the resistant cells partially sensitive to
MEK inhibitors and provides an opportunity to use compounds such as GSK1120212 and AZD6244, which are in
advanced stages of clinical investigation, to treat patients
who are refractory to BRAF inhibitors.
Another emerging common theme is the activation of RTKs,
in particular IGF-IR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR), possibly due to alterations in feedback loops or
compensatory survival mechanisms. Increased expression of
IGF-IR and PDGFR has been noted in 2 of 5 (12) and 4 of 11 (13)
postrelapse patient samples, respectively. Both IGF-IR and
PDGFR can activate PI3K/AKT signaling and modulate survival. Indeed, previous studies have shown that AKT can protect
melanoma cells from PLX4720-mediated apoptosis (21). More
recently, a MEK1-C121S mutation was identified in 1 patient
who developed resistance to PLX4032 (22). However, how
frequently MEK or RAS mutations occur and how significant
their contribution to resistance is, remain to be determined in a
larger cohort of patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.

Future Directions
Melanomas seem to engage a number of strategies to
bypass BRAF inhibition; however, issues regarding the prevalence of each compensatory mechanism and whether other
mechanisms will emerge in the clinical setting are still being
investigated. Collectively, all of the studies published to date
on resistance to BRAF inhibitors have put forward new
strategies to potentially override tumor recurrence (Fig. 1).
Reactivation of the MAPK pathway renders the resistant
tumors susceptible to MEK or extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK) inhibitors. Although MEK inhibitors have shown
mostly cytostatic effects or tumor stabilization in the clinical
setting, our results suggest that combining them with BRAF or
PI3K inhibitors may prove useful. Resistance associated with
activation of RTKs, including IGF-IR and PDGFR, or the
serine/threonine kinase COT, could be abrogated by a growing
number of pharmacologic inhibitors or blocking antibodies.
Encouragingly, multiple RTK inhibitors, as well as anti-IGF-IR
antibodies, are now under clinical investigation and could be
used in combination with RAF or MEK inhibitors. Targeting
molecules downstream of the receptors is another option.
PDGFR and IGF-IR can activate the PI3K pathway; therefore, it
is possible that this survival mechanism can be blocked by
pan-PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitors (12). Meanwhile, resistance caused by RAS or MEK mutations is potentially more
challenging because no effective inhibitors of RAS or mutant
MEK are currently available; however, the use of combination
therapies with MEK and PI3K, or BRAF and MEK inhibitors
may restrain these resistant tumors.
The complexity of bypass mechanisms suggests that personalized second-line treatment strategies may be needed. Despite
this challenge, however, certain commonalities indicate that
sometherapeuticapproachescouldbeeffectiveinlargercohorts
of patients regardless of the specific resistance mechanism. For
example, inhibitors of BRAF/MEK in combination with compounds targeting PI3K/AKT could potentially be used to treat

tumors with MAPK reactivation and enhanced PI3K-mediated
survival. Additionally, it is quite possible that novel inhibitors
will be developed to prevent paradoxical MAPK pathway reactivation or to keep both the MAPK and PI3K pathways in check.
The drug development field has not run out of options yet, and
we are optimistic about future developments.
Currently, several clinical trials are planned or in progress
to help sustain the effects of BRAF inhibitors and prevent
resistance, including trials combining selective BRAF and
MEK inhibitors. However, to guide future trials, comprehensive preclinical studies that consider the genetic and biologic
heterogeneity of melanoma should be designed to identify the
most effective and least toxic combinations. Carefully
designed phase I trials will also be required to determine
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the
experimental agents given in combination.
The melanoma field has made tremendous progress over the
past decade in elucidating the biology of this deadly disease,
and the encouraging clinical results are proof that this hard

work is paying off. We have many options and agents available
for combination treatments, and increasing knowledge about
the molecular mechanisms that underlie drug resistance will
facilitate the design of new effective, long-lasting therapies. We
are confident that this approach will result in sustained tumor
growth inhibition and improved patient outcomes.
