ABSTRACT
Recent studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be significant
functional regulators in tumor development, including bladder cancer. Here, we
found that PVT1 was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cells. Further
experiments revealed that PVT1 promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell
apoptosis. Furthermore we also used the emerging technology, synthetic biology,
to create tetracycline-inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors which silenced
PVT1 in a dosage-dependent manner to inhibit the progression of bladder cancer. In
conclusion, data suggest that PVT1 could be an oncogene and may be a therapeutic
target in bladder cancer. Synthetic “tetracycline-on” switch system can be used
to quantitatively control the expression of PVT1 in bladder cancer in response to
different concentration of doxycycline to suppress the progression of bladder cancer.

development of various human diseases, especially in
cancers [5–9]. PVT1 is upregulted in prostate cancer
and associated with cancer development [10]. In ovarian
cancer, PVT1 may be a vital downstream target for
therapy [11]. Besides, PVT1 promotes progression of
gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [12–14].
Furthermore, PVT1 overexpression acts independently of
MYC to promote cell proliferation and suppress apoptosis
in ovarian and breast cancer [15]. However, whether PVT1
also participates in development of bladder cancer is still
unknown and needed to be studied.
Tetracycline-inducible system is the most
widely utilized regulatory system and may be a useful
tool in the emerging era of medical synthetic biology
[16, 17]. The inducer, doxycycline, is nontoxic and used
widely in preclinical and clinical studies [16]. It can

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer is one of the most common leading
causes of cancer-related death in the world [1, 2]. Surgery,
radiation therapy and chemotherapy are current major
therapies for the treatment of patients diagnosed with
bladder cancer but survival rate remains disappointed
[3, 4]. One of the important reasons is lack of full
understanding of the mechanism to treat bladder cancer.
Recent studies suggest many oncogenes and tumor
suppressors including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
are key regulators for bladder cancer development. It
indicates that lncRNAs may be novel indicators for
treatment of bladder cancer.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are
greater than 200 nucleotides in length, involve in the

treat bladder cancer.
In this study, we found that PVT1 was upregulated
in bladder cancer tissues and cells, and functioned as an
oncogene in bladder cancer. shRNA sequences targeting

indicated that long non-coding PVT1 may function as an
oncogene in bladder cancer. Patients’ clinical parameters
are listed in Table 2.

PVT1 promoted cell proliferation of bladder
cancer in vitro
To investigate functional role of PVT1 in bladder
cancer cells, qRT-PCR was used to measure the relative
expression level of PVT1 at 48 h post-transfection in T24
and 5637. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, the relative
expression level of PVT1 in T24 and 5637 cells were
down-regulated significantly by si-PVT1 (p < 0.001 in
two cell lines). CCK-8 assay was performed to observe
whether si-PVT1 suppressed the proliferation of T24
and 5637 bladder cancer cells. The results showed that
si-PVT1 suppressed cell growth significantly in bladder
cancer cells (p < 0.001 in two cell lines) (Figure 3A
and 3B). Then, a more specific and sensitive method
[18, 19], EdU assay, was carried out to further detect
function of PVT1 in promoting cell growth. As shown
in Figure 4A, more EdU positive T24 or 5637 cells in
si-NC group and less EdU positive T24 or 5637 cells in
si-PVT1 group were observed after transfection of the
related siRNAs. EdU assay also showed that the number
of EdU positive cells in si-PVT1 group was reduced by
40% in T24 (P < 0.01) and decreased by 50% in 5637
(P < 0.01) (Figure 4C and 4D). These results indicated
that PVT1 promoted cell proliferation in bladder cancer.

RESULTS
PVT1 was upregulated in bladder cancer
tissues, cells and its correlation with clinical
pathologic factors
The relative expression level of PVT1 was detected
by performing real-time qPCR in a total of 32 patients with
bladder cancer. Compared with normal counterparts, the
PVT1 expression was upregulated significantly in 62.5%
(20 of 32) of cancer tissues (P < 0.01) (Figure 1A and 1B).
Compared with the SV-HUC-1 cell line, the PVT1
expression was increased significantly in bladder cancer
cells, T24 (P < 0.01) and 5637 (P < 0.001) (Figure 1C
and 1D). As Table 1 showed, upregulation of PVT1 was
highly correlated with bladder cancer histological grade
(P = 0.028). TNM stage also had a high association
with upregulated expression of PVT1 (P = 0.002). But
gender, age, tumor size and lymph node metastasis had
no associations with PVT1 expression level. These data

significantly when added with different concentration
of doxycycline (P < 0.01 in two cell lines) (Figure 2C
and 2D). When 1 μg/ml doxycycline was added to cells
transfected with PVT1 shRNA plasmids, the expression
level of PVT1 in group transfected with tetracyclineinducible PVT1 shRNA was decreased by 58% in T24
(P < 0.01) and decreased by 60% in 5637 (P < 0.001). And
it showed that doxycycline induced the expression of PVT1
shRNA to inhibit the expression of PVT1 in a dosagedependent manner. As 1 μg/ml doxycycline induced the
expression of PVT1 shRNA to inhibit PVT1 maximumly,
we chose the concentration, 1 μg/ml, for further study.

To investigate whether PVT1 suppresses apoptosis
of bladder cancer cells, cells were transfected with
si-PVT1 or si-NC and cell apoptosis was detected by the
caspase 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
Hoechst 33258 staining assay and flow cytometry assay.
Compared with cells transfected with si-NC, the activities of
caspase 3 (P < 0.01 in T24 cells; P < 0.001 in 5637 cells) and
the apoptosis ratio (P < 0.01 in two cell lines) were increased
significantly in cells transfected with the si-PVT1 (Figure
5A, 5B and 5G; Figure 6A and 6B). These results confirmed
that PVT1 inhibited cell apoptosis in bladder cancer.

Medical synthetic biology utilizing the principles
of engineering has emerged during the past several
years for treating human diseases such as bladder cancer
[17, 26, 27]. Inspired by the engineering principles
of synthetic biology, we designed the tetracyclineinducible switch which are widely used and well known
in synthetic devices to control the expression of shRNA
[17, 26].
In this study, we created the shRNA device
controlled by the tetracycline-inducible switch and
measured its anti-cancer effects. Our data suggested PVT1
was an oncogene in bladder cancer and the tetracyclineinducible shRNA targeting PVT1 inhibited the expression
of PVT1 in a dosage-dependent manner, and suppressed
cell growth and induced apoptosis in bladder cancer
cells. However, we should consider that this tetracyclineinduced device is not absolutely efficient. Efficiency of
the device may depend on the transfection efficiency.
Optimizing the transfection system or packing this device
as lentiviral vector may be a good choice to solve this
problem.
In conclusion, PVT1 promotes progression of
bladder cancer cells. Using the principles of synthetic
biology, we use the synthetic platform to construct the
device regulated by one of the synthetic parts, tetracyclineinducible switch, to control the expression of shRNA
targeting oncogene PVT1. Our results indicate this device
can quantitatively inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell
apoptosis in bladder cancer cells.

Tetracycline-inducible PVT1 shRNA induced
apoptosis of bladder cancer in vitro
The relative activity of caspase 3 was detected using
ELISA assay. The apoptosis ratio was tested using Hoechst
33258 staining assay and flow cytometry assay. The
relative activity of caspase-3 was significantly increased
when cells were treated with the PVT1 shRNA induced by
1 ug/ml doxycycline (P < 0.01 in two cell lines) (Figure 5C
and 5D). In the results of Hoechst 33258 staining assay,
the number of apoptotic cells in group transfected with
tetracycline-inducible PVT1 shRNA was significantly
larger than group transfected with the negative control
vector (P < 0.01 in two cell lines) (Figure 5E, 5F, 5H
and 5I). Compared with the negative control group, the
number of early apoptotic cells was increased significantly
in tetracycline-inducible PVT1 shRNA group (Figure 6C
and 6D).

DISCUSSION
LncRNAs involve in gene regulation and extend
our understanding of the biological behavior in diseases
inclusive of cancers [20, 21]. As a famous oncogene in
other cancer, PVT1 is located in chromosome 8q24 and is
closely near MYC which promotes progression of bladder
cancer [22, 23]. PVT1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer
and promotes cell growth through repressing p15 and p16
[13]. Upregulation of PVT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma
activates cell proliferation through stabilizing NOP2
[24]. Mouse PVT1 locus activates T lymphomagenesis
through encoding several overexpressed microRNAs
[25]. However, the association between PVT1 and bladder
cancer is not clear.
This is the first report to illustrate the functions
of PVT1 in bladder cancer. In this research, we found
that the expression of non-coding RNA PVT1 was
upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cells. PVT1
was also highly correlated with histological grade and
TNM stage of bladder cancer. To further understand
the biological roles of PVT1 in bladder cancer, we used
the CCK8, EdU assays and cell apoptosis assays to
detect cell growth and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells
through silencing PVT1. Cell growth arrest and increased
apoptosis were observed in bladder cancer cells and these
results indicated that PVT1 promoted the development of
bladder cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Human bladder cancer cells (T24, 5637) used in
this experiment and SV-HUC-1 cells were purchased
from the Institute of Cell Research, Chinese Academic
of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The T24 cells were
maintained in DMEM (Invirtogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
plus 1% antibiotics (100U/ml penicillin and100 μg/ml
streptomycin sulfates) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
at 37°C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in incubator. The
5637 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (1640) media
provided with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics in incubator
(37°C, 5% CO2). The SV-HUC-1 cells were maintained in
F12K medium (Invirtogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) plus 1%
antibiotics (100U/ml penicillin and100 μg/ml streptomycin
sulfates) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with
an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in incubator.

Patient samples
Thirty-two patients diagnosed with bladder cancer
were included in this study. Bladder cancer tissues and
matched para-cancer tissues were resected and then snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen quickly. Written formal approval

was also acquired from all the patients. This research was
admitted by the Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen
Second People’s Hospital.

Cell proliferation was monitored using Cell
Counting Kit-8, CCK-8 (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) and 5-ethynyl-20deoxyuridine (EdU) assay kit (Ribobio, Guangzhou,
China), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For CCK-8 assay, 5 × 103 cells per well were
seeded in a 96-well plate for 24 hours, then transiently
transfected with siRNAs or plasmids. CCK-8 assay was
performed according to the previous study [29]. EdU
incorporation assay was carried out according to previous
studies [30, 31]. All experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Creation of synthetic tetracycline-inducible
shRNA vectors targeting PVT1
The sequences of the related tetracycline-inducible
shRNA targeting PVT1 and the negative control were
designed and inserted into plasmid vector PEV-Lv208
which was brought from FulenGen firm, Guangzhou,
China. The tetracycline-inducible shRNA was generated
with CAGCCATCATGATGGTACT.

Transfection of cell lines

Caspase 3 ELISA assay

T24 and 5637 cells were transiently transfected
with specific siRNA oligonucleotides, PVT1 siRNA,
according to a previous study [28]. We chose the sequence,
‘CAGCCATCATGATGGTACT’, for further study. Nonspecific siRNA (si-NC) and si-PVT1 were purchased
from GenePharma, Suzhou, China. Bladder cancer cells
were seeded in six-well plates and get 30–50% confluence
before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected
with si-PVT1 (100 nM) and si-NC (100 nM) by using
Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Plasmid Midiprep kits (Promega, Madison,
USA) were used to get the plasmid vectors (PVT1 shRNA,
NC shRNA) for transfection.

T24 and 5637 baldder cancer cells were transiently
transfected with siRNA or plasmid in 12-well plates. After
48 hours, the activity of caspase 3 was detected by the
caspase 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
assay kit (Hcusabio, Wuhan, China) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. All experiments were performed
at least three times.

Hoechst 33258 staining assay
Two days after transfection, the Hoechst 33258
staining kit (Life, Eugene, OR, USA) was utilized to
observe the apoptotic cells induced by si-PVT1 or PVT1
shRNA plasmid [32]. Each assay was carried out at least
three times.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis

Flow cytometry assay

The TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA) were used to extract total RNA from
tissues or cells after transfection according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was transformed
to cDNA by utilizing PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with
gDNA Eraser (Takara, Dalian, China). The primer
sequences were shown: PVT1 primers [22] forward:5′GCCCCTTCTATGGGAATCACTA-3′,
reverse:
5′-GGGGCAGAGATGAAATCGTAAT-3′;
GAPDH
primers forward: 5′-CGCTCTCTGCTCCTCCTGTTC-3′,
reverse: 5′–ATCCGTTGACTCCGACCT TCAC-3′. A
standard SYBR Green PCR kit (Takara, Dalian, China)
was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) and qPCR was
executed in a final reaction volume of 20 μl according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. GAPDH was used as
the internal control and the data were normalized to the
expression of GAPDH. The reactions were carried out
on an ABI PRISM 7500 Fluorescent Quantitative PCR
System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
in triplicate. The results were analyzed by calculating
the relative amount of PVT1 using the comparative ΔCt
method. All experiments were carried out at least three
repetitions.

Bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells were transiently
transfected with siRNAs or plasmid vectors. 48 hours
after transfection, cells were harvested and then collected.
The FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (TransGen,
Perking, China) was utilized to double stain cells with
FITC-Annexin V and PI according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Flow cytometry (EPICS, XL-4, Beckman,
CA, USA) was utilized to observe cell apoptosis. In the
graphs, cells were discriminated into dead cells, living
cells, early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic cells.
The ratio of early apoptotic cells was regarded as an
observation index to compare the experimental group and
negative group. Each experiment was done at least three
times.

Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). All statistical analyses were executed
by using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).
Paired samples’ t test was used to analyze the PVT1
expression difference between bladder cancer tissues and
