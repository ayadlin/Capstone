BACKGROUND. The utility of sentinel lymph node (SNL) biopsy (SLNB) as a predictor of axillary lymph node status is similar in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patients who undergo surgery first. The authors of this
study hypothesized that patients with positive SLNs after neoadjuvant therapy
would have unique clinicopathologic factors that would be predictive of additional positive non-SLNs distinct from patients who underwent surgery first.

METHODS. One hundred four patients were identified who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, had a positive SLN, and underwent axillary dissection between
1997 and 2005. At the time of presentation, 66 patients had clinically negative
lymph nodes by ultrasonography, and 38 patients had positive lymph nodes confirmed by fine-needle aspiration. Eighteen factors were assessed for their ability

71%; P 5 .017). On multivariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, the method
for detecting SLN metastasis, multicentricity, positive axillary lymph nodes at
presentation, and pathologic tumor size retained grouped significance with a
bootstrap-adjusted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.762. The resulting nomogram
was validated in the external patient cohort (AUC, 0.78).

CONCLUSIONS. A significant proportion of patients with positive SLNs after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy had no positive non-SLNs. The use of a nomogram
based on 5 predictive variables that were identified in this study may be useful
for predicting the risk of positive non-SLNs in patients who have positive SLNs

he accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) for
predicting the status of axillary lymph nodes in patients with
early-stage breast cancer has been confirmed in several studies, and
SLNB rapidly is replacing axillary dissection as the initial surgical
approach to the axilla in clinically lymph node-negative patients.1–5
For patients who have negative SLNs, no further axillary surgery is
performed; however, for patients who have positive SLNs, completion axillary dissection remains the standard practice. Low axillary
recurrence rates have been reported for SLN-positive patients who
do not undergo completion axillary dissection in the adjuvant

setting; however, only a few larger studies have confirmed initial reports from single institutions with
short-term follow-up.6–10
Questions have arisen regarding the utility of
SLNB for patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy as the use of this technique has become
more prevalent in clinical practice. The timing of
SLNB in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been debated, although studies have
demonstrated that SLNB is accurate both before and
after therapy.11,12 Some clinicians favor SLNB before
neoadjuvant chemotherapy so that lymph node staging information can be used to help choose a specific chemotherapy regimen. Others prefer to perform
SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been
completed, because some initially lymph node-positive patients may have a complete pathologic
response in the lymph node basin and, thus, they
potentially may avoid a completion axillary lymph
node dissection.13–15 In general, patients who have
positive axillary lymph nodes identified before
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, either by ultrasoundguided biopsy or by SLNB, are committed to standard axillary dissection after they complete chemotherapy. However, patients who have negative axillary
lymph nodes before neoadjuvant chemotherapy may
not need to undergo a standard axillary dissection
after they complete chemotherapy.
Currently, a nomogram designed by investigators
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is
being used in clinical practice to predict the probability of non-SLN metastases in patients who have a
positive SLN.16 This nomogram, which helps to identify patients with positive SLNs who may be spared
additional axillary surgery, has been validated by
several institutions, yet it may not be useful for the
subset of patients who have received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.17 We sought to develop a nomogram
designed specifically to predict the likelihood of positive non-SLNs in patients with a positive SLN after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To develop this nomogram, we analyzed multiple clinical and pathologic
factors for their ability to predict positive non-SLNs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
By using a prospective database, we identified 104
patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, who had a positive SLN on subsequent SLNB,
and who underwent a completion axillary lymph
node dissection between 1997 and 2005. Individual
clinical and tumor characteristics, treatment regimens, and patient outcomes were recorded. An SLN
was considered positive if it contained a tumor de-

2647

posit that measured >0.2 mm, in accordance with
the sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer Staging Manual.18 All patient information was
reviewed for accuracy by examination of the primary
source documents. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (M. D. Anderson)
with waiver of informed consent.
We evaluated 18 factors for their ability to predict positive non-SLNs in patients with positive
SLNs: estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor
status, HER-2 status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI),
method of detection of SLN metastasis (immunohistochemical analysis, hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)
staining, or touch preparation cytology), nuclear
grade, multifocality, multicentricity, pathologic tumor
size, primary tumor clinical response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, lymph node clinical response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, use of taxanes in the
neoadjuvant regimen, duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<4 months or 4 months), number of
negative SLNs, number of positive SLNs, presence of
positive axillary lymph nodes at initial presentation
(determined by axillary sonography and fine-needle
aspiration [FNA] biopsy), maximum SLN metastasis
size (defined as largest SLN metastasis size), and presence of extranodal extension in the SLN. Univariate
assessment of the 18 potential predictors of positive
non-SLNs was performed by using chi-square analysis. Then, a multivariate logistic regression model
was used to construct a nomogram to predict nonSLN metastases among patients with SLN metastases
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All 18 variables of
interest were entered into a full model, and the final
model was selected by using a backwards elimination
procedure with Akaike’s information criterion to
determine whether a factor should be deleted from
the model.19 The nomogram was validated internally
with 200 bootstrap samples, and the bootstrapadjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the
nomogram’s ability to rank patients on the basis of
risk. According to this evaluation, a nomogram with
good discrimination will predict a higher probability
of non-SLN metastases for a patient who has nonSLN metastases than for a patient who does not.
The nomogram was validated externally with
data from 41 patients with breast cancer who were
treated at the University of Michigan. Pretreatment
lymph node status for these patients was determined
by using sonography and FNA biopsy with or without
SLNB. Patients who were identified as lymph node
negative by sonography and FNA underwent an
SLNB to confirm lymph node status. Patients who

were identified as lymph node positive were treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a subsequent SLNB; then, all patients underwent a completion axillary dissection. The M. D. Anderson
nomogram (available at http://www.mdanderson.
org/postchemoSLNnomogram) was used to predict
the odds of positive non-SLNs for each patient. Performance of the nomogram in this group of patients
was assessed by plotting the receiver operating characteristic curve and calculating the AUC. The 95%
confidence interval of the AUC for the validation set
was determined by calculating the AUC for 10,000
bootstrap samples and calculating the 2.5% and 97.5%
quantiles. Analyses were performed by using R 2.3.1
with the contributed packages Design and ROCR.20–22

RESULTS
Patient Data
Demographics for the 104 patients who were treated
at M. D. Anderson whose information was used to
develop the nomogram are shown in Table 1. The
median age for the study population was 52 years.
The median clinical tumor size at presentation was
4 cm, and the median postneoadjuvant chemotherapy
pathologic tumor size was 0.7 cm. At the time of initial presentation, 66 patients had clinically negative
lymph nodes by sonography, and 38 patients had
positive axillary lymph nodes determined by ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy. The majority of tumors
were estrogen receptor positive (83%), progesterone
receptor positive (67%), HER-2 negative (80%), and
negative for LVI (75%). The maximum SLN metastasis
size was 0.57 cm, and metastases were detected most
commonly by H&E staining (52%). Overall, 58 patients
(56%) had positive non-SLNs.
Nomogram
In univariate analyses, the factors that were associated significantly with non-SLN metastases at the
P<.05 level were positive axillary lymph nodes at presentation, method of SLN metastasis detection, presence of LVI, multicentricity, lymph node response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nuclear grade, number
of positive SLNs, and maximum SLN metastasis size.
Patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes
at presentation were less likely to have positive nonSLNs than patients with FNA biopsy-positive axillary
lymph nodes at presentation (47% vs 71%; P 5 .017).
The presence of positive non-SLNs by pathologic
tumor classification (T) was as follows: T0, 0% (0 of
2 patients); T1a, 25% (1 of 4 patients); T1b, 58% (7 of
12 patients); T1c, 59% (19 of 32 patients); T2, 50%
(20 of 40 patients); and T3, 79% (11 of 14 patients).

FIGURE 1. Five-variable nomogram. This nomogram was based on 5 variables to predict positive nonsentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs) after neoadjuvant therapy. To calculate the probability of non-SLN metastasis, Pr (NSLN),
for an individual patient, sum the points for each variable (Points), locate
that sum on the Total Points line, and draw a line straight downward.

SLN metastasis were detected by immunohistochemistry, the tumors were not multicentric, and no
patient had initial positive lymph node disease. Pathologic tumor size for the 6 patients was as follows:
2 patients, 0.5 cm; 1 patient, 1.0 cm; 1 patient, 1.45
cm; 1 patient, 1.50 cm; and 1 patient, 2.0 cm.

External Validation
All patients from the University of Michigan who
were used for external validation of the nomogram
had positive axillary lymph nodes at initial presentation. The majority of these patients had tumors that
were negative for LVI (26 patients; 63%) and negative
for multicentricity (40 patients; 98%). The median
postneoadjuvant chemotherapy final pathologic tumor size was 1.2 cm. Final tumor size was unknown
for 2 patients. In this validation group, 17 patients
(41.5%) had non-SLN metastases identified. Metasta-

ses were detected by H&E staining. A comparison of
characteristics of the University of Michigan patients
and the M. D. Anderson patients using the nomogram variables is provided in Table 3. Figure 3 shows
the receiver operating characteristic curve based on
the University of Michigan validation group. The
AUC was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.92).
When applying the nomogram to the validation
cohort, no patients had a predicted probability of
additional positive non-SLNs of <10%. Figure 2B
shows the distribution of patients according to total
point scores for the validation cohort.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we observed that 44% of
patients who had a positive SLN after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy had no additional axillary lymph node
disease. Thus, a significant proportion of the patients
in this series were exposed to the potential morbidity
of a completion axillary dissection without a significant benefit. With the nomogram derived and validated in this study, we now have a tool to predict the
likelihood of positive non-SLNs in patients who have
positive SLNs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This
new nomogram is composed of 5 clinical and pathologic factors: LVI, method of detection of SLN metastasis, multicentricity, initial lymph node status, and
pathologic tumor size. The data available from application of the proposed nomogram can be used both
intraoperatively and postoperatively, depending on
the clinical scenario. Data obtained from this nomo-

gram should be used in conjunction with the clinical
context of individual patients to aid in the surgical
decision-making process. Physicians can apply the
data from this tool when there is a need to risk stratify patients who are treated in the neoadjuvant setting to help determine the potential benefit of a
completion axillary dissection.
Over the last several decades, there has been a
paradigm shift in the surgical treatment of patients
with breast cancer away from maximally invasive
procedures to more minimally invasive techniques.
Outcomes for these less invasive surgeries largely
have been favorable, have produced equal survival,
and often have spared patients considerable morbidity. The use of SLNB for staging in patients with
clinically lymph node-negative breast cancer is an
example of this change in surgical practice. Because
many studies have demonstrated that SLNs are the
only positive lymph nodes in the majority of patients
who undergo surgery first, the need for completion
axillary dissection in this patient population has
been questioned.
In recent years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has
been used with increasing frequency, and it has been
determined that patients who present with biopsy-

proven axillary lymph node disease can be converted
to a lymph node-negative status with the use of such
therapy.13,14 Further support for the finding that
neoadjuvant chemotherapy can convert patients to
lymph node-negative status comes from the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-18
study, in which patients who were assigned randomly
to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a lower
percentage of positive lymph nodes after treatment
than patients who underwent primary surgical therapy.23 This lymph node conversion facilitated by
neoadjuvant treatment is the rationale for attempts
to define which patients with a positive SLN after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy can forego a completion
axillary lymph node dissection.
For patients who undergo surgery first, the incidence of positive non-SLNs in patients with a positive SLN ranges from 34% to 40%.24,25 In patients
who have documented axillary lymph node involvement at initial evaluation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in the eradication of lymph node
metastases in 22% to 30% of patients.12–14,26 Earlier
studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy that included
patients with clinical findings suggestive of axillary
lymph node involvement produced a complete axillary lymph node response rate that ranged from 25%
to 38%.14,27–30 In a previous report by Kuerer et al.,
53% of patients who had a negative axilla identified
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by clinical examination and sonography had positive axillary lymph

nodes at pathologic examination.31 However, 97% of
those patients had only 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes
or had small-volume disease (2–5 mm).31 These findings suggest that a subset of patients with positive
axillary lymph nodes before neoadjuvant chemotherapy will have minimal or no residual axillary disease
after they receive neoadjuvant treatment, further
supporting investigation of the potential use of SLNB
as a definitive procedure in patients who have a
complete clinical axillary response.
Lymph node basins are evaluated after chemotherapy, because any residual lymph node disease
has been considered a potential source of locoregional and systemic recurrence.32 Several series have
demonstrated that, in patients who undergo surgery
first and have negative SLNs on SLNB, the axillary
failure rate is very low.8,33–38 In addition, to date, 5
studies with relatively small patient numbers have
demonstrated that patients who undergo surgery first
and have a positive SLN on SLNB also have a low
recurrence rate after SLNB alone.6–10 One additional
study subselected patients who had only micrometastases in SLNs and reported that this small patient
group was recurrence free after SLNB alone at a median follow-up of 42 months.39 Those studies provide
the only information available to date regarding the
risk of recurrence in patients with a positive SLN on
SLNB who do not undergo completion axillary dissection. It is noteworthy that none of the patients in
those studies received neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
and most patients had early-stage disease.
Several studies have examined factors that are
predictive of lymph node involvement beyond the
SLNs in patients who undergo surgery as initial treatment. Factors that have been associated with positive
non-SLNs in these patients include SLN metastasis
size, primary tumor size, LVI, lack of drainage on
lymphoscintigraphy, more than 1 positive SLN, presence of extranodal extension, and number of positive SLNs.25,40–53 A meta-analysis performed by
Degnim et al. confirmed these findings and demonstrated that macrometastasis, extranodal extension,
larger tumor size, more than 1 positive SLN, and LVI
were the most important predictors of non-SLN disease in patients who underwent surgery first.54 Bedrosian et al. specifically looked at patients with larger
primary tumors and observed that the factors predictive of positive non-SLNs included tumor size
3 cm and macrometastasis, factors similar to those
reported for patients with earlier stage disease.55 Far
fewer studies have examined the likelihood of
non-SLN involvement in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, because these patients typically have been committed to a completion axillary

2651

dissection regardless of their response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Factors predictive of any persistent lymph node involvement in the neoadjuvant
setting have included clinical and pathologic
response of the primary tumor, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, size of the primary tumor, and
patient age.13,14,26,56
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
to define unique clinicopathologic factors for nonSLN involvement in patients who have a positive
SLN after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On the basis of
multivariate analysis, the nomogram we developed
considers 5 clinicopathologic factors to assess patient
risk: LVI, method of SLN metastasis detection, multicentricity, initial lymph node status, and pathologic
tumor size. These markers largely are consistent with
those reported for patients who undergo surgery first.
The method of SLN metastasis detection and initial
lymph node status most likely reflect the macrometastatic nature of the SLN tumor burden. The presence of multicentricity and pathologic tumor size
likely are reflective of a larger primary tumor. Finally,
LVI was a predictor of non-SLN disease in nearly all
studies, both in patients who underwent surgery first
and in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, supporting the significance of this biologic
marker as a measure of lymph node disease burden.
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering nomogram is
being used in clinical practice to facilitate surgical
decision making for patients who undergo surgery
first and have a positive SLN identified.16 This nomogram may not be applicable to patients who are
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.16 In fact, a
group that is attempting to validate the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering nomogram with an external cohort
of patients who received neoadjuvant therapy
reported an AUC of 0.66, which was not considered
sufficient to provide good discrimination for this
patient subset.17 The M. D. Anderson nomogram, in
contrast to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering nomogram,
was designed specifically to be predictive for patients
who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering nomogram consists of 7 components: nuclear grade, LVI, multifocality, estrogen
receptor status, number of positive and negative
SLNs, pathologic tumor size, and method of detection of SLN metastasis.16 Three components from
the M. D. Anderson nomogram overlapped with the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering nomogram: LVI, pathologic
tumor size, and method of detection. In the M. D.
Anderson nomogram, multicentricity was a better
predictor of additional lymph node involvement than
multifocality in both univariate and multivariate
analyses. Some of the patients in this study may

have been candidates for surgery first, yet the use of
neoadjuvant therapy has increased considerably to
include also patients who are striving for improved
cosmesis or who prefer to pursue genetic testing during neoadjuvant therapy before making a surgical
plan. In light of these more recent changes in patient
management, the data obtained from the proposed
neoadjuvant nomogram should be contributory,
regardless of the primary presenting stage of the
patient.
It is interesting to note that initial lymph node
status also was a unique component of the M. D.
Anderson nomogram. It is standard practice at our
institution to perform routine axillary ultrasonography as a component of preoperative staging. Patients
are assessed with ultrasonography and FNA biopsy of
suspicious axillary lymph nodes during the initial
workup and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer. This procedure, which allows for more definitive
clinical staging of patients, is not standard practice
at many institutions, which may be an obstacle to
widespread use of the proposed neoadjuvant nomogram. However, as the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy continues to expand, it is likely that more
clinicians will implement additional rigorous clinical
staging techniques to facilitate the identification of
patients who would benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. Therefore, definitive knowledge of initial lymph
node status may become more widespread and the
proposed nomogram may become more widely applicable in the near future.
The M. D. Anderson nomogram was validated
prospectively in a group of patients who received
neoadjuvant therapy at the University of Michigan.
In this group of patients, the M. D. Anderson model
performed well, demonstrating an AUC of 0.78. This
finding demonstrates the predictive ability of the M.
D. Anderson nomogram for patients who are treated
with neoadjuvant therapy in a large academic setting.
Most attempts at external validation of the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering nomogram have demonstrated good
correlation, although not all have been successful.17,57–60 These findings underscore the importance
of external validation before a proposed nomogram
can be applied in general clinical practice. We encourage other groups, both in the community and in
academic settings, to test the utility of the M. D.
Anderson nomogram further in additional patient
populations who are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
The current study indicates that patients who are
treated with neoadjuvant therapy and who have positive SLNs are at high risk for having positive nonSLNs. However, 44% of the patients in the study did

not have non-SLN disease and, thus, underwent an
unnecessary completion axillary dissection. Because
the morbidity of axillary dissection is often a great
concern for patients, the use of this M. D. Anderson
nomogram will help to inform both clinicians and
patients regarding the potential necessity of axillary
dissection in the setting of positive SLNs after neoadjuvant treatment. Although the standard of therapy
continues to be a completion axillary dissection in
all patients with positive SLNs, the ultimate goal is to
individualize therapy such that only patients who
will benefit from a treatment will be subjected to the
potentially associated morbidity. Clinical trials examining the outcomes of patients with regional lymph
node disease who undergo directed surgical resection
or observation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will
aid in determining the ultimate utility of SLNB or regional lymphadenectomy as a means for establishing
definitive breast cancer prognosis and regional control of disease.
