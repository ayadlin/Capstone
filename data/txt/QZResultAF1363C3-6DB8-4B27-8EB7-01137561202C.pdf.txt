ABSTRACT
Increasing interest in repurposing the diabetic medication metformin for
cancer treatment has raised important questions about the translation of promising
preclinical findings to therapeutic efficacy, especially in non-diabetic patients. A
significant limitation of the findings to date is the use of supraphysiologic metformin
doses and hyperglycemic conditions in vitro. Our goals were to determine the impact
of hyperglycemia on metformin response and to address the applicability of metformin
as a cancer therapeutic in non-diabetic patients. In normoglycemic conditions, lower
concentrations of metformin were required to inhibit cell viability, while metformin
treatment in hyperglycemic conditions resulted in increased glucose uptake and
glycolytic flux, contributing to cell survival. Mechanistically, maintenance of c-Myc
expression under conditions of hyperglycemia or via gene amplification facilitated
metabolic escape from the effects of metformin. In vivo, treatment of an ovarian
cancer mouse model with metformin resulted in greater tumor weight reduction in
normoglycemic vs. hyperglycemic mice, with increased c-Myc expression observed in
metformin-treated hyperglycemic mice. These findings indicate that hyperglycemia
inhibits the anti-cancer effects of metformin in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our
results suggest that metformin may elicit stronger responses in normoglycemic
vs. hyperglycemic patients, highlighting the need for prospective clinical testing in
patients without diabetes.

INTRODUCTION

clear need for the identification of economical, safe,
and effective drugs for the treatment of ovarian cancer,
potentially through the repurposing of drugs used for
alternative indications.
In recent years, epidemiological studies have
identified an association between use of a common
diabetes treatment, metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide
hydrochloride), and improved survival in diabetics
with gynecologic cancers (reviewed in [6]), including
ovarian [7, 8]. Metformin use has also been associated
with improved survival in hepatocellular [9], colorectal
[10, 11], prostate [12], and pancreatic [13] cancers.
These studies, however, provide little information on the
potential benefits of metformin for cancer patients without
diabetes. Metformin functions in the treatment of type 2

Drug repurposing is a paradigm in which a Food
and Drug Administration-approved drug is utilized for a
new indication, accelerating the timeline and decreasing
the cost of drug development [1]. Such a strategy is
particularly attractive for the treatment of ovarian
cancer, where platinum-based therapies have been in use
since the late 1970s and improvements in survival have
been minimal [2]. In an effort to improve survival, a
VEGF inhibitor, bevacizumab, has recently been added
to the conventional carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen.
This combination results in modest improvements in
progression-free survival [3, 4], but comes at a cost
of approximately $58,050 per patient [5]. There is a

diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing
serum glucose concentrations, largely through inhibition of
hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhanced muscular glucose
uptake [14]. If the anti-cancer benefits of metformin in
diabetic patients occur as a result of a systemic reduction
in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, survival benefits
may not translate to non-diabetic patients [15, 16].
In addition to its systemic effects, metformin
directly alters the energy balance in cells through
inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron
transport chain, resulting in an increase in the AMP/ATP
ratio. Subsequent activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) works to restore energy balance in the cell
by inhibiting energy-consuming processes, including fatty
acid and protein synthesis [14, 15]. As recently reviewed
[6], preclinical studies demonstrate that metformin inhibits
tumor growth and alters metabolism in gynecologic
cancers. In ovarian cancer, metformin treatment has been
shown to activate (phosphorylate) AMPK, inhibit fatty
acid and protein synthesis, and result in cell death [17,
18]. However, these studies, and most in vitro studies
in other cancer types, used doses of metformin (10-40
mM) which would not be achievable in patients [15, 16].
Whether these increased concentrations of metformin
are truly necessary to achieve anti-cancer effects, or if
they are merely a result of the inherent artificiality and
hyperglycemic nature of in vitro experiments, has been a
source of recent study [19-22].
In the present study, we sought to determine the
impact of lower doses of metformin on ovarian cancer
under normo- and hyperglycemic conditions. To approach
this, we used multiple ovarian cancer cell lines, primary
cells from a patient with ovarian cancer, and a syngeneic
mouse model to test the hypothesis that hyperglycemic
conditions inhibit the anti-cancer effects of metformin by
allowing for a compensatory increase in glycolysis and
escape from the energetic stress induced by metformin
treatment. Overall, our goals were to determine if antiovarian cancer effects can be attained with lower doses of
metformin and to begin to address the clinical question of
the applicability of metformin as a cancer therapeutic for
patients without diabetes.

nu, and HeyA8 cell viability. In contrast, in “standard”
cell culture conditions, which are hyperglycemic (25
mM glucose [23]), metformin’s cytotoxic effect was
suppressed (Figure 1A). A similar response was observed
using primary human ovarian cancer cells isolated from
ascites, with increased cytotoxicity noted following
metformin treatment in normoglycemic conditions (Figure
1B). Additionally, a dose-response relationship was noted,
with increasing concentrations of glucose resulting in
decreasing metformin cytotoxicity in HeyA8 cells (Figure
1C). To ensure that increased metformin response in
normoglycemic conditions was not mediated solely by the
acute reduction in glucose levels in the cell culture media,
long-term cultures were performed. Here, HeyA8 cells
were cultured in media containing 5.5 or 25 mM glucose
for two weeks. The media was changed daily and glucose
levels were monitored to ensure that stable glucose
concentrations were maintained. Following long-term
exposure to normo- or hyperglycemic conditions, cells
cultured in 5.5 mM glucose continued to demonstrate an
enhanced response to metformin, as determined by effects
on cell viability (Figure 1D).

Higher doses of metformin are necessary to
activate AMPK in hyperglycemic conditions
One hypothesized mechanism by which metformin
inhibits cancer growth is through phosphorylation
and activation of AMPK [14, 15]. As a measure of
metformin response, three ovarian cancer cell lines and
primary ovarian cancer cells were treated with a range of
metformin concentrations in normo- or hyperglycemic
conditions and the phosphorylation of AMPK (pAMPK)
at Thr172 was analyzed. Metformin treatment at doses
≤ 5 mM led to a dose-dependent increase in pAMPK in
all three cell lines and primary cells in media containing
5.5 mM glucose, while there was only minimal AMPK
activation (phosphorylation) in media containing 25 mM
glucose (Figure 2A-2B). A similar effect was noted when
cells underwent long-term exposure to differential glucose
conditions. Increased activation of AMPK by metformin
was noted in cells cultured for two weeks in 5.5 mM
glucose as compared to 25 mM glucose (Figure 2C).
To test whether glycemic conditions altered the
effects of metformin on targets downstream of AMPK
activation, a key mediator of fatty acid synthesis (acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC)) and a marker of protein
synthesis (ribosomal protein S6) were evaluated [24].
Phosphorylation (inactivation) of ACC at Ser79 was
increased by metformin treatment in 5.5 mM glucose,
but not in 25 mM glucose (Figure 2D). Likewise,
phosphorylation of S6 at Ser240/244 was suppressed
by metformin treatment in 5.5 mM glucose, but not in
25 mM glucose (Figure 2D). These data suggest that
in normoglycemic conditions low doses of metformin

the response to metformin, three ovarian cancer cell lines
were treated with a range of metformin concentrations

mM glucose, but only a slight effect in 25 mM glucose
(Figure 3C), suggesting that, similar to metformin, lower
doses of phenformin induce anti-ovarian cancer effects in
normoglycemic conditions.

Response to phenformin is also suppressed by
hyperglycemia

Increased glycolytic flux decreases metformin
sensitivity in hyperglycemic conditions

Phenformin, another member of the biguanide class
of drugs, has been shown to have more potent anti-cancer
effects than metformin in vitro, likely due to its increased
lipophilic nature and greater uptake/transport as compared
to metformin [25, 26]. To determine if our findings were
biguanide-specific, the effect of phenformin on ovarian
cancer growth and AMPK activation was evaluated in
normo- and hyperglycemic cell culture conditions. Like
metformin, the ability of phenformin to inhibit cell
viability was significantly reduced in hyperglycemic (25
mM) as opposed to normoglycemic (5.5 mM) conditions
(Figure 3A). In addition, increasing glucose levels dosedependently inhibited phenformin response (Figure
3B). Treatment with phenformin at one-tenth of the
concentration of metformin (100 µM phenformin vs. 1
mM metformin) led to a robust increase in pAMPK in 5.5

To explore the mechanism by which cells in
hyperglycemic conditions escape the cytotoxic and
AMPK-activating effects of biguanides, glucose
metabolism was evaluated. A significant increase in
glucose uptake was noted following metformin treatment
in 25 mM glucose but not in 5.5 mM glucose (Figure
4A). In addition, metformin treatment resulted in a dosedependent increase in glycolytic flux in hyperglycemic
conditions, which was not observed in normoglycemic
conditions (Figure 4B). Consistent with the effects on
glucose uptake and glycolysis, increased production of
lactate as a glycolytic output was observed following
metformin treatment, with the greatest increase in lactate
production occurring in hyperglycemic conditions
(Figure 4C). Interestingly, pentose phosphate pathway

Differential effects of metformin in normo- and
hyperglycemic conditions are mediated by c-Myc

(PPP) activity was suppressed by metformin treatment
in normoglycemic but not hyperglycemic conditions,
suggesting the necessity of glucose utilization for
energy production rather than anabolic processes in
normoglycemic conditions (Figure 4D).
Next, we asked whether inhibiting glycolysis
would improve metformin sensitivity in hyperglycemic
conditions. To test this, cells were treated with metformin
plus the glycolytic inhibitors 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG)
or
3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one
(3PO), which inhibit the activities of hexokinase and
6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3
(PFKFB3), respectively [27, 28]. In the presence of either
glycolytic inhibitor, cells in hyperglycemic conditions
were sensitized to metformin; the combined treatment
also increased the toxicity of metformin in normoglycemic
conditions (Figure 4E). Together, these findings suggest
that in hyperglycemic conditions ovarian cancer cells
escape the effects of metformin through activation of
glycolysis.

c-Myc is an important oncogenic transcription
factor which regulates the expression of many enzymes
and nutrient transporters involved in cellular metabolic
processes [29]. Since modulation of c-Myc expression can
alter glycolytic output to enable metabolic adaptation [30],
we examined the effect of metformin treatment on c-Myc
protein levels in differential glycemic conditions. c-Myc
expression was strongly inhibited by metformin treatment
in normoglycemic conditions, while this effect was largely
attenuated in hyperglycemic conditions (Figure 5A).
Reflecting the decrease in c-Myc expression, expression
of the c-Myc transcriptional target hexokinase-2 (HK2),
the enzyme which phosphorylates glucose to glucose6-phosphate, was also suppressed following metformin
treatment in normoglycemic conditions (Figure 5A).

conditions, a robust increase in PDK1 expression was

and glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase (PKM2)
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), was not altered
by metformin treatment in either glycemic condition
(Supplemental Figure S1).
To further understand the role of c-Myc in metformin
response, cells were treated with a c-Myc inhibitor, 10058F4 (denoted as F4) [31], alone or in combination with
metformin. In hyperglycemic conditions, the addition
of F4 to metformin inhibited the induction of PDK1
expression (Figure 5B). In a cell viability assay, addition
of F4 also increased the cytotoxic effect of metformin in
hyperglycemic conditions. In fact, co-treatment with F4
eliminated the difference in metformin response between
hyperglycemic and normoglycemic conditions. In
contrast, addition of the c-Myc inhibitor did not enhance
metformin response in normoglycemic conditions (Figure
5C), consistent with the strong reduction in c-Myc
expression observed following metformin treatment in
these conditions. Overall, these results suggest that, in
hyperglycemic conditions, the inability of metformin

to inhibit c-Myc expression allows for increased PDK1
expression and aerobic glycolysis, which facilitates
metformin resistance.

Metformin response is inhibited in cell lines with
MYC gene amplification
To further evaluate the impact of c-Myc
on metformin sensitivity, metformin response in
normoglycemic conditions (5.5 mM glucose) was
assessed in three ovarian cancer cell lines with MYC
gene amplification (Kuramochi, SNU-119, and 59M) and
one cell line without MYC amplification (HeyA8) [32].
As compared to the cell line without MYC amplification
(HeyA8), the cytotoxicity of metformin was lower in
the three cell lines with MYC amplification (Figure 6A).
Treatment of MYC-amplified cells (Kuramochi and SNU119) with the combination of metformin and a c-Myc
inhibitor (10058-F4, denoted as F4) led to increased
metformin sensitivity (Figure 6B). Furthermore, treatment

of a MYC-amplified cell line (Kuramochi) with metformin
in normoglycemic conditions had no effect on c-Myc or
HK2 expression, while PDK1 expression was increased
(Figure 6C), in direct contrast to our findings in a cell
line without MYC amplification (HeyA8, Figure 5A).
Together, these results suggest that maintenance of c-Myc
expression, whether through hyperglycemia or gene
amplification, inhibits metformin response.

ovarian cancer cell lines, ID8 cells exhibited decreased
sensitivity to metformin treatment in hyperglycemic
conditions as compared to normoglycemic conditions
(Figure 7A). To evaluate the effect of glycemic conditions
on metformin efficacy in vivo, hyperglycemia and glucose
intolerance were induced in a syngeneic mouse model of
ovarian cancer (Figure 7B). Using a cancer prevention
strategy (Supplemental Figure S2), the effect of metformin
on tumor burden was compared to placebo. At the time
of sacrifice, hyperglycemic mice had significantly
increased tumor burden as compared to normoglycemic
mice and metformin treatment did not significantly
reduce tumor weight. In contrast, normoglycemic mice
treated with metformin had significantly reduced tumor
weight compared to placebo controls (Figure 7C).

treatment resulted in a greater reduction in tumor weight in
normoglycemic mice as compared to hyperglycemic mice,
with suppression of AMPK phosphorylation and induction
of c-Myc expression observed in the hyperglycemic mice
treated with metformin.
Only by evaluating metformin in glucose conditions
that more closely reflect normal physiology will we begin
to get a comprehensive understanding of the molecular
mechanisms mediating the drug’s anti-cancer effects.
We demonstrate that ovarian cancer cells specifically
in hyperglycemic conditions, but not normoglycemic
conditions, are able to escape the cytotoxic effects of
metformin by increasing glucose uptake and glycolytic
flux, and that addition of a glycolytic inhibitor (2DG or
3PO) improves metformin response. These results are
consistent with findings in other cancers indicating that
metformin increases extracellular acidification [33] and
that 2DG enhances the cytotoxic effects of metformin [34,
35]. Furthermore, under normoglycemic conditions, we
were able to identify a suppressive effect of metformin
on the pentose phosphate pathway; a finding that, to
our knowledge, has not yet been reported and likely
contributes to the anti-cancer effects of metformin.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sustained
c-Myc expression facilitates metformin resistance.
Consistent with reports in breast and prostate cancer

showed that metformin-treated hyperglycemic mice
had decreased AMPK phosphorylation as compared
to placebo-treated mice. In contrast, tumors from
metformin-treated normoglycemic mice had increased
AMPK phosphorylation as compared to placebo-treated
controls. Interestingly, c-Myc expression was increased
in metformin-treated hyperglycemic mice, suggesting that
compensatory pathways similar to those found in vitro
also occur in vivo (Figure 7D).

DISCUSSION
Although metformin has shown significant promise
as an anti-cancer therapeutic in preclinical studies,
concerns remain about the translation of these findings
- especially those utilizing high doses of metformin - to
potential clinical efficacy in patients without diabetes. In
this study, we demonstrate that low doses of metformin
inhibit ovarian cancer cell viability and activate AMPK
when tested under physiologic normoglycemic conditions
(5.5 mM glucose). Furthermore, we show that, in
the setting of hyperglycemia, cancer cells undergo a
compensatory increase in glycolysis that is likely
mediated by c-Myc activity (Figure 8). In support of the
in vitro findings, in a syngeneic mouse model, metformin

Figure 8: Metabolic compensation in hyperglycemia reduces metformin sensitivity. We hypothesize that cancer cells in

hyperglycemic conditions are less sensitive to the energetic stress induced by metformin due to compensatory upregulation of glycolysis
mediated by c-Myc. Under these conditions, metformin treatment results in increased PDK1 expression, thereby inhibiting PDH activity
and shuttling glycolytic output towards lactate production. In normoglycemic conditions, however, c-Myc expression is inhibited by
metformin treatment, and this survival-promoting metabolic mechanism does not occur.

indicating that metformin suppresses c-Myc expression
through miRNA-mediated inhibition [36] or posttranslational modification [37], we show that metformin
reduces c-Myc expression in ovarian cancer specifically
under normoglycemic conditions. In contrast, in
hyperglycemic conditions, metformin does not reduce
c-Myc expression, instead resulting in increased PDK1
expression and glycolytic flux. Consistent with our
findings, addition of a PDK1 inhibitor, dichloroacetate,
enhanced metformin response in prostate cancer cells
[38]. Further supporting a role for c-Myc in metformin
resistance, ovarian cancer cell lines with MYC gene
amplification were relatively insensitive to metformin
treatment even in normoglycemic conditions. Together,
these findings not only explain the attenuated effect of
metformin in hyperglycemic conditions, but also suggest
that, clinically, MYC amplification in patient tumors might
serve as a predictive biomarker of metformin response.
As outlined above, the molecular mechanisms
mediating the anti-cancer effects of metformin are multifaceted and context-dependent. However, clinically,
the most important question is: Will metformin, at
physiologically attainable doses, have anti-cancer effects
in patients without diabetes? In this report we show that,
compared to prior studies [17, 18], 10-20-fold lower
doses of metformin are effective if cell culture conditions
are normoglycemic. As the epidemiological evidence
suggesting potential anti-cancer effects of metformin is
from patients using metformin as treatment for diabetes,
some argue that metformin will not work as a cancer
therapeutic in patients without diabetes. Our findings
suggest the opposite. Using a hyperglycemic syngeneic
mouse model we showed that metformin’s inhibition of
ovarian cancer growth was greatest in normoglycemic
mice and, in fact, metformin did not significantly reduce
tumor growth under conditions mimicking hyperglycemia
in poorly controlled diabetes. Complementing our in
vitro findings, c-Myc expression was strongly induced in
hyperglycemic mice treated with metformin, reflective of
compensatory metabolic changes promoting cancer cell
survival.
In summary, we report that low doses of metformin
can inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth if cell culture
conditions are normoglycemic, and that metformin
sensitivity is reduced in hyperglycemic conditions.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that c-Myc-mediated
compensatory metabolic changes inhibit response to
metformin and that the anti-cancer effects of metformin
can be restored through the addition of either a glycolytic
or c-Myc inhibitor. Our findings, both in vitro and in
vivo, using a hyperglycemic mouse model, support the
hypothesis that metformin will have anti-cancer benefits
in non-diabetic patients. However, this question can
ultimately only be answered through the prospective
clinical testing of metformin as adjuvant treatment in
cancer patients without diabetes. Preclinical reports in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ovarian cancer indicate that metformin increases response
to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy [17, 39-42].
Building on these findings, several clinical trials are
underway for gynecologic malignancies [6], including
our ongoing trial of standard chemotherapy with or
without metformin as up-front treatment for ovarian
cancer (NCT02122185, https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Equally
important to prospective testing, future evaluation of the
molecular mechanisms of action mediating metformin’s
anti-cancer effects should only be undertaken with
serious consideration of the impact of glucose levels,
perhaps aided by the utilization of innovative cell
culture techniques to increase the reliability of in vitro
experiments [43]. Ultimately, understanding the effects
of the nutrient environment and cellular metabolic
regulation on metformin response will aid the design and
interpretation of preclinical experiments and inform the
clinical use of metformin in the treatment of ovarian and
other cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and cell lines
The HeyA8, Tyk-nu, DOV13, and ID8 ovarian
cancer cell lines were provided by Dr. Gordon Mills, Dr.
Kenjiro Sawada, Dr. Maria Barbolina, and Dr. Katherine
Roby, respectively. The Kuramochi, SNU-119, and 59M
ovarian cancer cell lines were purchased from the Japanese
Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank, the Korean
Cell Line Bank, and the European Collection of Cell
Cultures, respectively. All cell lines were authenticated
by IDEXX BioResearch (Columbia, MO). Metformin
(1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride), phenformin
(phenethylbiguanide hydrochloride), and 2DG were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 3PO and
5-​[(4-​ethylphenyl)methylene]-​2-​thioxo-​4-​thiazolidinone
(10058-F4) were purchased from Calbiochem/Millipore
(Billerica, MA) and Cayman Chemical Company (Ann
Arbor, MI), respectively. The pAMPK Thr172 (40H9),
AMPK (23A3), GAPDH (14C10), pS6 Ser240/244, S6
(54D2), pACC Ser 79, c-Myc (D84C12), PDK1 (C47H1),
HK2 (C64G5), and HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit and horse
anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA). The ACC and β-actin (AC15) antibodies were from Millipore and Sigma-Aldrich,
respectively.

Isolation of primary ovarian cancer cells from
ascites
Ascites were collected from a chemotherapy-naïve
ovarian cancer patient via paracentesis under a protocol
approved by the University of Chicago Institutional
23556

Oncotarget

Glycolytic flux assay

Review Board. Ascites (100 mL) were immediately
centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The resulting cell pellet
was re-suspended in PBS and passed through a 40 µm
nylon mesh cell strainer to enrich for cancer cell spheroids.
Cells were re-suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS,
non-essential amino acids, and vitamins and incubated
in tissue culture plasticware for 6 h to remove remaining
immune and mesothelial cells via differential adhesion.
The supernatant containing cancer cells was transferred to
new tissue cultureware and cells were allowed to adhere
for 72 h prior to use in experiments.

Glycolytic flux was assayed by quantifying the
H2O produced from [5-3H]glucose through the enolase
step of glycolysis, as described in [46, 47] with minor
modifications. Cells were plated in 12-well plates
overnight in DMEM containing 5.5 or 25 mM glucose
and subsequently treated with 0.5, 1, or 5 mM metformin
for 24 h. Following treatment with metformin, all cells
were changed to fresh media containing 1 µCi/mL [5-3H]
glucose (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) for 1 h. The media
was then collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000 rpm.
To separate the 3H2O produced by the cells, 150 µL of
media were placed in a tube surrounded by 1 mL H2O in a
closed system and allowed to equilibrate for 48 h at 37°C.
The tube containing media was then removed and 3H was
quantified using a Tri-Carb scintillation counter (Packard/
PerkinElmer), as a measure of glycolytic flux. Counts
were normalized to protein concentration.

Cell viability assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates in quintuplicate
overnight and subsequently treated as indicated. Cell
viability was determined via MTT assay with 0.5 mg/mL
thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich), as
previously described [44]. For ID8 cells, cell number was
determined by cell counting and trypan blue exclusion.

Pentose phosphate pathway assay

Immunoblotting

Pentose phosphate pathway flux was assayed by
quantifying the 14CO2 produced from [1-14C]glucose and
released with the concomitant generation of ribulose-5phosphate, as described in [48] with minor modifications.
Cells were plated in T-25 flasks in DMEM containing
5.5 or 25 mM glucose and allowed to attach overnight.
To measure the 14CO2 released, a well (Kimble Chase,
Vineland, NJ) containing filter paper saturated in 10 M
KOH was inserted into each flask and the cells were
treated with 5 mM metformin in DMEM containing
5.5 or 25 mM glucose. The cells were simultaneously
labelled with 3 µCi/mL [1-14C]glucose. After 24 h, 1 mL
3 N acetic acid was added to each flask and incubated at
room temperature for 1 h for complete release of 14CO2
from the media. The filter paper was then removed from
the chamber and 14C was quantified using a Tri-Carb
scintillation counter (Packard/PerkinElmer), as a measure
of pentose phosphate pathway flux.

Cells were plated in 60 mm dishes overnight
in DMEM containing 5.5 or 25 mM glucose and
subsequently treated as indicated. Lysates were prepared
and immunoblotting was performed as previously
described [17].

Long-term culture in
hyperglycemic conditions

normoglycemic

or

HeyA8 cells were cultured in DMEM containing
5.5 or 25 mM glucose. Cells were passaged every three
days with media changed daily to maintain glucose levels.
Glucose concentrations were measured daily using a
FreeStyle glucometer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
IL). Following >2 weeks of culture in the indicated levels
of glucose, cells were subjected to cell viability and
western blot assays as described.

Lactate assay

Glucose uptake assay

Production of lactate was determined using the
EnzyChrom™ L-Lactate Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems,
Hayward, CA). Cells were plated in 96-well plates
overnight in DMEM containing 5.5 or 25 mM glucose
and subsequently treated with 5 mM metformin for 24
h. Following treatment with metformin, medium was
collected from the cells and lactate levels were assayed
via colorimetric detection at 595 nm according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was normalized
to protein concentration.

Cells were plated in black 96-well plates overnight
in DMEM containing 5.5 or 25 mM glucose and
subsequently treated with 5 mM metformin for 24 h.
Glucose uptake was determined using a fluorescently
labeled glucose analog, 2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose (2-NBDG; Cayman
Chemical Company) [45], according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Relative fluorescence was normalized to
protein concentration.

3 trial of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer. N Engl J Med.
2011; 365:2484-2496.

A model of hyperglycemia was generated by
feeding 5 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) a 60% kCal fat diet (Harlan
Teklad, Indianapolis, IN) for 4 months. Normo- and
hyperglycemic mice were then treated with metformin
(200 mg/kg/day) or placebo (PBS) intraperitoneally
for 3 weeks. ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cells (1.2×106)
were injected orthotopically into the ovarian bursa and
treatment with metformin or placebo was continued for 12
weeks before the mice were sacrificed. Glucose tolerance
tests were performed following a 16 h fast by injecting
2 g/kg D-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) intraperitoneally
and measuring blood glucose levels with a FreeStyle
glucometer (Abbott Laboratories). Mean tumor weight
in the ovary was compared between normo- and
hyperglycemic mice treated with metformin or placebo.
Tumors were homogenized in RIPA buffer and protein
expression was analyzed by western blot. All animal
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Chicago.
