ABSTRACT
Accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes contributes to cancer
development and progression. Compared with gene mutations or deletions,
epigenetic changes are reversible, which alter the chromatin structure remodeling
instead of changes in DNA sequence, and therefore become a promising strategy for
chemotherapy. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of enzymes that responsible
for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. MPT0G030 is a potent and selective
class I HDAC inhibitor which showed broad-spectrum cytotoxicity against various
human cancer cell lines. in vitro fluorometric HDAC activity assay showed that
MPT0G030 effectively inhibited Class I HDACs (HDAC1~3), which were overexpressed
in many malignant neoplasms. Interestingly, MPT0G030 not only induced histone
acetylation and tumor suppressor p21 transcription, but also redistributed E-cadherin
and activated Protein Kinase C δ (PKCδ), which was linked to cell apoptosis and
differentiation. Further, activation of PKCδ was demonstrated to be modulated
through HDAC1. The in vivo anticancer activity of MPT0G030 and the importance of
PKCδ were confirmed in the HT-29 tumor xenograft models. Taken together, those
results indicate that MPT0G030, a class I HDAC inhibitor, has great potential as a new
drug candidate for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) comprise a class of
enzymes responsible for the epigenetic regulation of gene
expression, and play critical roles in cellular processes
including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation
and angiogenesis [2]. Numerous reports indicate HDACs
are overexpressed in many cancers, especially HDAC1,
HDAC2, and HDAC8 are overexpressed in colon cancer,
and inhibit specific tumor suppressor genes, resulting in
an aberrant epigenetic status compared to adjacent normal
cells [3, 4]. Therefore, HDAC inhibitors have the potential
to become a new class of chemotherapy drugs for cancer
treatment.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common
malignant neoplasm worldwide. In contrast to other
cancers, the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence
is well established as an ordered process of sequential
accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in
tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes [1]. Compared
with gene mutations or deletions, epigenetic changes,
which are alterations of chromatin structure rather than
changes in DNA sequence, are reversible. Therefore, they
can be used as a promising strategy for chemotherapy.

Interestingly, HDAC families play critical roles
in regulating normal homeostasis of colonic epithelium
cells, especially in the proliferative crypt compartment.
Considerable evidence shows that that knockdown of
class I HDACs 1 and 2 inhibits cell growth and survival
in various colon cancer cell lines [5-7]. In contrast to
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drug treatment, HDAC
inhibitor treatment of colon cancer cells results in
enhanced differentiation and accelerated apoptosis [4, 8].
Thus, differentiation therapy has been recently proposed
as an alternative medical treatment for colon cancer
chemotherapy.
Protein Kinase C (PKC) family consists of numbers
of serine-threonine protein kinases involved in regulating
diversified signaling transduction cascades. Activation of
PKCα and β isoforms contributes to tumor proliferation,
invasion, drug resistance, and genetic instability [9].
However, many studies have implicated downregulation,
rather than activation, of PKCδ in sporadic human colonic
cancer in resistance to apoptosis and differentiation [9,
10]. Transient overexpression of PKCδ has been linked
to tumor-suppressive functions, including suppression
of anchorage-independent cell growth [11], reversal of
colonic epithelial cells transformation via Src [12], and
inhibition of neoplastic phenotype via p53 [13]. Therefore,
PKCδ is thought of as a tumor suppressor. Moreover,
accumulating evidence suggests that HDAC inhibitors
could activate protein transcription through protein kinase
signaling pathways, rather than chromatin remodeling.
It has been shown HDAC inhibitor modulates Sp1dependent gene expression through the PKCδ signaling
pathway [14]. However, the degree and mechanism
underlying the HDAC involvement in protein kinase
activation remain unexplored.
MPT0G030
(3-[7-amino-1-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-5-yl]-N-hydroxyacrylamide) (Figure 1A) is a novel class I HDAC inhibitor
that shows broad-spectrum cytotoxicity against various
human cancer cell lines. However, the molecular action
mechanism of class I HDAC inhibitor in colorectal cancer
has not been clearly elucidated. The studies described
here reveal the signaling mechanisms responsible for
MPT0G030-induced cell differentiation and apoptosis in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

human colorectal HT-29 cancer cells.

RESULTS
MPT0G030 inhibits cell growth and induces cell
death in human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells
To evaluate the biological effects of MPT0G030,
human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells were grown in
the absence or presence of indicated concentrations
of MPT0G030 for 24 or 48 h. As revealed by the
sulforhodamine B assay (SRB) assay, MPT0G030 affected
cell growth inhibition in a concentration-dependent
manner, not only in the HT-29 cells (Figure 1B, GI50 =
0.145 ± 0.01 μM), but also in various other cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Table 1). MPT0G030’s cytotoxicity
effect was measured using MTT assay, Figure 1C showed
that MPT0G030 caused 50% cell death at a concentration
of 1 μM or higher (IC50 = 0.985 ± 0.06 μM). To verify
whether MPT0G030-induced cell death is concomitant
with any alteration of cell cycle distribution, FACScan
flow cytometry was performed following MPT0G030
treatment with concentrations and times as indicated.
MPT0G030 induced a significant increase in the number
of apoptotic cells (subG1 phase) in concentration- and
time-dependent manners (Figure 1D and 1E). In addition,
to distinguish whether MPT0G030-induced cell death
is due to apoptosis or necrosis, a photometric enzyme
immunoassay was conducted. The data showed that
MPT0G030 increased the relative amount of cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragments in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 1F), supporting the hypothesis
that MPT0G030 induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells.
Compared with SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid),
which is the HDAC inhibitor currently approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cancer therapy
drug, MPT0G030 showed more effective on inducing
cell apoptosis. These results confirmed that MPT0G030
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HT-29
cells.

MPT0G030 inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC)
activity

demonstrating a respective IC50 of 75.07 ± 4.65 nM, and
241.75 ± 47.65 nM (Table 1). MPT0G030 is a markedly
stronger inhibitor of HDAC1 than is SAHA. Interestingly,
by contrast to SAHA, MPT0G030 (IC50 = 4368.21 ±
42.07 nM) has almost no ability to inhibit HDAC6 (IC50
of SAHA= 78.31 ± 8.96 nM) (Table 1).
Inhibition of Class I HDACs is linked to
upregulation of histone H3 acetylation and p21 mRNA and
protein expression [2], which have been associated with
anti-proliferative activity. It has also been reported that
HDAC6 functions as an α-tubulin deacetylase, modulating
tubulin stability [2]. We decided to further investigate the
relationship between protein expression and function of
MPT0G030. As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, accumulation
of acetylated histone H3 was accompanied by increased
expression of p21 protein level in MPT0G030-treated
HT-29 cells concentration- and time-dependently, but no

MPT0G030 was designed as a HDAC inhibitor;
its ability to inhibit HDACs was evaluated using two
different fluorometric HDAC activity assays under
varying conditions (with or without cells, total HDACs
or individual HDAC isoforms). Relative to SAHA,
MPT0G030 showed significantly higher inhibition of
total HDACs in HT-29 cells with its IC50 being 6.45 ±
1.39 μM (Figure 2A, IC50 of SAHA = 29.62 ± 2.62 μM).
HDACs are divided into four classes based on their
sequence homology. To evaluate the inhibition effects of
MPT0G030 on individual HDAC isoforms, assays were
performed with recombinant HDAC enzymes. MPT0G030
was an effective inhibitor of HDAC1 and HDAC2,

acetyl-α-tubulin was detected. In addiction, p21 mRNA
was also upregulated before p21 protein was detectable
(Figure 2D). These results suggest that, in contrast to the
pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA, MPT0G030 is an effective
and selective class I HDACs inhibitor.

differentiation, the adherens junction protein E-cadherin
is important in maintaining cell structures; functional
E-cadherin is associated with the cytoskeleton stability
and is located in cell-cell adhesion [16]. By using
immunofluorescence analysis, we found E-cadherin was
significantly redistributed in response to MPT0G030
treatment (Figure 3B). Translocation of the E-cadherin
protein was detected by concentration- and timedependent increases in cytoskeleton fraction following
incubation with different concentrations of MPT0G030
and over time (Figure 3C). Additionally, E-cadherin
mRNA was upregulated by treatment with MPT0G030
(Figure 3D). These results suggest that MPT0G030
promotes differentiation and changes the morphology of
colon cancer cells through E-cadherin redistribution.

and

The class I HDACs is important regulators of cell
proliferation and survival in the colonic proliferating
crypt compartment, and they also function as inhibitors
of cell maturation. Interestingly, by using phase-contrast
light microscopy, we observed that MPT0G030 treatment
of colon cancer HT-29 cells changed their morphology
in a concentration-dependent fashion. Generally, control
HT-29 cells were circular, oval, or slightly polygonal
in appearance, even at varying cell densities (Figure
3A). Following incubation with MPT0G030 for 24 h,
a decreased cell number and the appearance of floating
cells reflected the cytotoxic effect of MPT0G030-induced
apoptosis (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, Figure 3A showed
that HT-29 cell morphology was altered, changing from
circular to columnar and elongated (the so-called domelike structure), which is a typical feature of the induction
of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation [15]. During

Activation of PKCδ contributes to MPT0G030induced cell differentiation and cell death
Previous studies have shown PKCδ participates
in HDAC inhibitor-induced differentiation of colon
cancer and the resultant growth arrest and apoptosis in
various cancers, but the mechanisms underlying this
effect remains unclear [14, 17]. To investigate whether
MPT0G030 activates or regulates PKCδ at the level of
transcriptional control in colon cancer cells, HT-29 cells

were incubated with MPT0G030 and compared with timematched controls. MPT0G030 treatment induced PKCδ
mRNA expression in a concentration- and time-dependent
manner as detected by quantitative PCR (Figure 4A). In
addition, PKCδ protein levels also increased with time
(Figure 4B). Because the activity of PKCδ is controlled via
phosphorylation at conserved serine/threonine sites [10],
phosphorylation of PKCδ at threonine 505 was monitored
by Western blot. In Figure 4B, PKCδ phosphorylation
progressively increased from 6 to 24 hours following
MPT0G030 treatment. To further confirm the contribution
of PKCδ to MPT0G030-induced biological effects,
rottlerin, a specific PKCδ inhibitor, was used to suppress
the activation of PKCδ. The combination of MPT0G030
and rottlerin markedly reversed the induction of cell death
seen with MPT0G030 alone (Figure 4C). Meanwhile, HT29 cells were transiently transfected with PKCδ siRNA
to deplete its expression. PKCδ siRNA specifically and
efficiently downregulated the expression of PKCδ, but
control siRNA had no effect. In contrast with control
groups, PKCδ siRNA-transfected cells reversed the
MPT0G030-induced cleavage of PARP, which as a marker
for programmed cell death (cell apoptosis) (Figure 4D).
Previous studies have shown that PKCδ plays a critical
role in E-cadherin trafficking in epithelial cells [18]. We
examined the effect of PKCδ on MPT0G030-induced
E-cadherin redistribution. The translocation of E-cadherin

was attenuated in PKCδ siRNA-transfected cells (Figure
4E), whereas the E-cadherin mRNA was not affected
(Figure 4F). These results suggest that the activation of
PKCδ caused by MPT0G030 contributes to both colon
cancer differentiation and cell death.

MPT0G030-induced PKCδ activation is mediated
by HDAC1
Since MPT0G030 is designed to be an HDAC
inhibitor, the contribution of HDACs to MPT0G030induced PKCδ expression was investigated. This was
achieved by evaluating MPT0G030-induced PKCδ mRNA
and protein levels after overexpressing HDAC1 in HT-29
cells. We observed that the change of PKCδ mRNA was
imperceptible when HDAC1 was overexpressed without
MPT0G030 treatment (Figure 5A). Additionally, the
increase of PKCδ mRNA was not reversed in HDAC1overexpressing cells with drug treatment (Figure 5A).
However, the protein level and phosphorylation of
PKCδ was reduced significantly, and MPT0G030induced cell apoptosis was also reversed when HDAC1
was overexpressed (Figure 5B). Collectively, these
results show that HDAC1 participates in translation and
activation of PKCδ, which implicating HDAC1 regulates
PKCδ from functional level but not transcriptional level.

real-time RT-PCR after 1.5, 3, 6, 9 h treatment of MPT0G030. (B) HT-29 cells were treated with vehicle or different concentrations of

MPT0G030 inhibits HT-29 tumor cell growth in
the mouse xenograft models

HT-29 xenograft samples were stained with Hematoxylin
and Eosin and Ki-67. These experiments revealed that
MPT0G030 significantly decreased cell proliferation, of
which Ki-67 is a marker (Figure 6C). Tumor homogenates
were also prepared for Western blots, and the results
showed agreement with the in vitro studies (Figure 6D).
In particular, HDAC1 was significantly decreased within
tumors when treated with MPT0G030 (Figure 6D). Taken
together, these findings indicate that MPT0G030 exhibits
good ability and advantage as an anti-cancer drug for
colon cancer in vivo and in vitro.

To further evaluate the in vivo anti-cancer activity
of MPT0G030, HT-29 tumor xenograft models were
established using athymic nude mice. Mice bearing
established HT-29 tumors were treated by oral gavage
with vehicle or MPT0G030 (100 mg/kg qd (once every
day), 200 mg/kg qd) for the duration of the experiment
(18 days), where SAHA (200 mg/kg qd) was used as
reference. In contrast to the vehicle-treated group,
administration of MPT0G030 resulted in significant
inhibition of tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 6A). Baseline body weight, which is an indicator
of the health of the mice, was not affected by MPT0G030
during the study period, suggesting that mice tolerated
the treatment without experiencing evident toxicity in
vivo (Figure 6B). Furthermore, histological sections of

DISCUSSION
The colonic crypt is the basic functional unit of
the human intestine, a highly regenerative organ of the
human body formed by a single sheet of colon epithelial
cells [19, 20]. Mature differentiated colon cells increase
the ability of water absorption and mucus secretion, and
then undergo apoptosis at the end of the colonic life cycle
[19]. Tumorigenesis in colon epithelial cells is associated
with uninhibited tissue regeneration and cell proliferation.
The normal physiologic roles of HDACs have been
studied for several decades and identified as important
tumor promoters that inhibit colon cell maturation and
transformation [4]. Abundant literature has shown that
treatment with HDAC inhibitors arrests cell growth and
stimulates differentiation and apoptosis of colon cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo [4, 6-8, 17]. Therefore, other than
existing cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, HDAC inhibitors
may redirect cancer cells back into the normal colonic life
cycle of cell differentiation and apoptosis, implicating a
rational and promising strategy for colon cancer therapy.
Considerable evidence implies that HDAC
inhibitors reprogram cell terminal differentiation
and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells in vivo
and in vitro [4, 8]. Differentiation and apoptosis are
physiological processes that are closely linked and in fact
inseparable, sharing numerous common features such as
chromatin condensation and activation of caspases [21].
Therefore, apoptosis is considered as the endpoint of the
differentiated-colonocyte life cycle in vivo [17, 19, 22].
In our study, MPT0G030 rapidly induced cell apoptosis
after 6-12 h of being administered (Figure 1E), during
which redistribution of E-cadherin was detected (Figure
3E). This suggests that apoptosis and differentiation might
occur simultaneously in MPT0G030-treated cells.
Previous studies have shown that HDAC inhibitorinduced differentiation is PKCδ-dependent in colon cancer
cells [17], and that PKCδ enhances the differentiation
and accelerates the apoptosis in PKCδ-overexpressing
colon cancer CaCo-2 cells [22]. We observed that PKCδ
mRNA and protein levels increased after MPT0G030
treatment (Figure 4A, 4B). The role of PKCδ was further
elucidated: our experiment with PKCδ siRNA-transfected
cells revealed that E-cadherin distribution was modulated

by PKCδ (Figure 4E), but the expression of E-cadherin
mRNA was not altered (Figure 4F), implying that PKCδ
regulated E-cadherin at the protein functional level.
Meanwhile, in the presence of MPT0G030, co-treatment
with rottlerin significantly increased cell viability (Figure
4C), and transfection with PKCδ siRNA also reversed
PARP cleavage (Figure 4E). These results show that
MPT0G030-induced PKCδ participates in cell apoptosis
and concomitantly promotes differentiation of colon
cancer cells through E-cadherin redistribution and changes
in cell morphology.
Taking into account the different epigenetic and
genetic expression profiles of colon cancer cell lines, the
drug effect of MPT0G030 was also examined in HCT116
cells. HCT116 cell line is known to harbor KRAS
mutation, p53 wild type and normal APC; HT-29 has
mutated BRAF, p53 and truncated version of APC. Even
so, MPT0G030 inhibited HCT116 cell growth effectively
(Supplementary Table 1) and increased PKCδ expression
and activity (Supplementary Figure 1A). Demonstrating
that alteration of PKCδ by MPT0G030 might is general
effect for colon cancer but not particular for one cell line.

The E-cadherin-catenin complex plays a critical
role in regulating a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases via
direct and/or indirect interactions; for instance, as reported
for the EGF and Met receptors [23, 24]. In colorectal
carcinomas, loss or mislocalization of E-cadherin protein
is a functional perturbation rather than a simple protein
decrease, resulting in dedifferentiation, invasion and
metastasis [25]. The expression pattern of E-cadherin
has therefore been identified as an important prognostic
factor for assessing colon cancer tumor grade. E-cadherin
mRNA was upregulated with MPT0G030 treatment
(Figure 3D), and the distribution was evidently at the site
of cell-cell adhesion (Figure 3B, 3C). What is more, PKCδ
activation plays a critical role in E-cadherin trafficking in
epithelial cells via the Met signaling pathway [18, 24].
The tyrosine kinase receptor Met, whose expression is
normally confined to epithelium cells, is a proto-oncogene
that plays a crucial role in cell regeneration, proliferation,
and migration [26]. Abundant evidence demonstrates
that c-Met is overexpressed in a large variety of cancer
types, especially in cells of epithelial origin [27]. We also
investigated Met mRNA and protein expression after

MPT0G030 treatment, discovering that the activation
of Met was significantly inhibited and Met protein level
was progressively decreased (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Collectively, MPT0G030 might act by increasing the
tumor suppressor PKCδ expression and decreasing the
proto-oncogene Met expression via HDAC inhibition,
with both these effects contributing to the observed
E-cadherin redistribution.
Increasing evidences indicated that histone
acetylation by HDAC inhibitors is not the only
mechanism of transcriptional activation; post-translational
modifications through multiple protein kinases including
MAPKs, PI3K, Akt, and PKCδ have also been identified
[2, 4, 14]. Our research shows that the activation of
PKCδ was inhibited by HDAC1 (Figure 5). In our study,
MPT0G030 slightly decreased HDAC1 mRNA but not
altered total protein levels of HDAC1 in vitro (Data not
shown). Therefore, we further focused on the enzyme
activity inhibition of HDAC1 caused by MPT0G030
in vitro. However, we found that PKCδ was activated
and HDAC1 was significantly decreased within tumors
after MPT0G030 treatment (Figure 6D), suggesting that
MPT0G030 might contribute more to inhibit HDAC1
expression, which was linked to PKCδ activation, in
human colorectal HT-29 xenograft. However, many
studies indicate that overexpressing individual HDACs do
not entirely compensate for the simultaneous inhibition
of multiple HDACs by HDAC inhibitor [7]. This may
be because transcription-independent effects induced by
HDAC inhibitor are equally important in the alteration of
gene expression as are in their anticancer activities, linked
as they are to biological effects such as apoptosis. Notably,
closely related HDACs may compensate for each other to
maintain functional integrity; for example, HDAC1 might
cover HDAC2 function [28].
However, the unselective pan-HDAC inhibitor
SAHA, currently approved for treatment of leukemia and
solid tumors, may cause a number of unwanted side effects
due to the significance of HDACs in normal physiology
[29]. Meanwhile, considering the compensation effect
between related HDACs in individual HDACs family,
development of drugs that selectively target individual
HDACs family has emerged as a new approach in
cancer therapy. In this paper, we explored the HDAC
inhibition effects of MPT0G030. Compared with SAHA,
MPT0G030 is more potent and selective in inhibition
of class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2 and 8), and especially in
its non-targeting of HDAC6 (IC50 of MPT0G030 >55
fold x IC50 of SAHA, Table 1). In addition, MPT0G030
also selectively induced cytotoxicity in various cancer
cells without causing significant toxicity in normal
(human umbilical vein endothelial) cells; the IC50 value
of MPT0G030 in normal cells was about thirty times
higher than that in HT-29 cells (Supplementary Figure
1C; whereas SAHA was about six fold). Recently, the
selective HDAC class I inhibitor entinostat (MS-275) has
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been undergoing phase 1/2 clinical trials targeting various
cancers, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma, breast cancer
and lung cancer. However, according to results seen in HT29 cells (GI50 = 1.29 μM) [30], MPT0G030 may well show
better efficacy (GI50 = 0.145 ± 0.01 μM). The potential of
individual HDACs inhibitors as drug targets in cancer
therapy are worthy of consideration. Taken together,
our studies indicate that MPT0G030, a class I HDAC
inhibitor, has great potential as a new drug candidate for
cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
MPT0G030 (Figure 1A) was designed and
synthesized by Professor Jing-Ping Liou’s Lab. (School
of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical
University). RPMI-1640 medium and fetal bovine
serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Penicillin-Streptomycin Amphotericin B
Solution was obtained from Biological Industries (BeitHaemek, Israel). Antibodies against various proteins
were purchased from following sources: PKCδ and
phosphor-PKCδ (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA);
caspase-3 (Imgenex Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA);
PARP-1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA); actin (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA); goat
anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); goat antirabbit IgG-FITC (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA);
VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA); Propidium iodide,
Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA).

Cell Culture
The human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29 was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin 100 U/ml,
streptomycin 100 μg/ml, and amphotericin B 2.5 μg/ml.
Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2/95% air.

Sulforhodamine B (SRB) Assay
Cells were inoculated into 96-well plates in
growth medium. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 10%
trichloroacetic acid (TCA), to represent a measurement
of the cell population at the time of drug addition (Tz).
After incubation with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or different
5659

Oncotarget

concentrations of compound for 48 h (Tt), cells were
fixed with 10% TCA and stained with 0.4% SRB. After
staining, unbound SRB was removed by 1% acetic acid.
Bound SRB was solubilized with 10 mM trizma base and
the absorbance was measured at 515 nm. Percentage of
growth inhibition was calculated as: 100−[(Tt-Tz)/(CTz)] ×100. Tt represents absorbance of compound-treated
group, and C means absorbance of vehicle-treated group.

equivalent amounts of protein fractions were loaded and
separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were
incubated with specific primary antibodies and appropriate
secondary antibodies. Detection of signal was performed
with chemiluminescence detection kit (Visual Protein
Biotechnology, Taipei, Taiwan).

Transient Transfection

MTT Assay

Silencer select siRNA against PKCδ was purchased
from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA). HT-29 cells were
transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection
Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Transfected cells were grown at 37°C then
harvested for Western blot analysis.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in growth
medium overnight. Cells were treated with vehicle (0.1%
DMSO) or different concentrations of compound for 24
h, then incubated with MTT reagent at 37°C for 1 h. After
incubation, the insoluble formazan produced in living
cells. The formazan crystals were dissolved with DMSO
and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm.

Immunofluorescence Analysis.

FACScan Flow Cytometric Assay

Cells were grown on 8-well chamber slides
and treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or different
concentrations of compound for 24 h. Cells were fixed
with ice-cold methanol and incubated with 2% BSA/
PBS blocking buffer. E-cadherin was stained with antiE-cadherin primary antibody and anti-rabbit IgG-FITC
secondary antibody. Subsequently, mounted the slide in
VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium and sealed the edges.
Photomicrographs were taken using the Carl Zeiss LSM
510 Meta Confocal Microscope.

HT-29 cells were exposed to vehicle (0.1% DMSO)
or different concentrations of MPT0G030 for indicated
time and then fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol at −20°C
overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended
in PI solution containing propidium iodide (80 μg/ml) and
RNase A (100 μg/ml) at room temperature. Then, cellular
DNA content was detected with FACScan flow cytometry
(BD Biosciences). Cells were counted and cell cycle was
analyzed by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Quantitative RT-PCR

Fluorometric HDAC Activity Assay

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent by the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, USA). 5 µg mRNA
was incubated with random primer at 65°C for 5 min, then
mixed with M-MLV RT at 37°C for 1 h to obtain cDNA.
The SYBR Green PCR reaction (SYBR® Green PCR
Master Mix; Roche, Switzerland) was used to evaluate
the amplification of p21, c-Met, PKCδ and E-cadherin
genes. Primer sequences used for amplification are as
follows: p21, 5’-GGC AGA CCA GCA TGA CAG ATT3’ and 3’-GCG GAT TAG GGC TTC CTC T-5’; PKCδ,
5’-AAC CAT GAG TTT ATC GCC ACC-3’ and 3’-AGC
GTT ACA TTG CCT GCA TTT-5’; E-cadherin, 5’-ATT
CTG ATT CTG CTG CTC TTG-3’ and 3’-AGT CCT GGT
CCT CTT CTC C-5’. Fluorescent signal was detected and
recorded by StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, USA), and each amplification reaction was
checked for the absence of nonspecific PCR products by
melting curve. Relative fold changes in gene expression
are calculated as 2-∆∆Ct.

Two different types of in vitro HDAC activity assays
were used (with or without cells). Test compounds were
incubated with individual recombinant HDAC isoforms
(HDAC 1-9) and the assay was performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (BPS Biosciences, USA). HT-29
cells were treated with MPT0G030 and SAHA for 24 h,
and then total cell lysates were analyzed with Fluorometric
HDAC Activity Assay Kit (BioVision, USA).

Western Blotting and Cell Extraction
Cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO)
or different agents for indicated time and harvested by
trypsinization. Resuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold
cell lysis buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA,1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM
NaF, 10 μg/mL leupetin, 10 μg/mL aprotinin]. The cell
lysate was centrifuged after incubation on ice for 15
min. Soluble and insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions
were prepared as previous described [16, 31]. Then,

HT-29 cells were injected subcutaneously into
athymic nude mice to establish HT-29 xenograft model
(~100 mm3), and then divided into four groups (n = 7)
and dosed by gavage with (a) vehicle (1% carboxymethyl
cellulose + 0.5% Tween 80), (b) MPT0G030 100 mg/
kg qd (once every day), (c) MPT0G030 200 mg/kg
qd, (d) SAHA 200 mg/kg qd. Tumor volumes were
calculated using caliper measurements twice per week
using the formula volume (mm3) = (length × width2)/2.
Body weights were measured daily during the first week
and twice per week thereafter. Mice were housed under
standard conditions (12 h light/12 h dark at 21~23 °C and
60~85% humidity) with ad libitum access to sterilized
food and water. The protocols of the in vivo study were
approved by the Animal Care and User Committee at
National Taiwan University.
