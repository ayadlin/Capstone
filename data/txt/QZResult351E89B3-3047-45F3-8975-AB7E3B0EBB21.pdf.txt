Abstract
The magnetic nanoparticle has emerged as a potential multifunctional clinical tool that can provide cancer
cell detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement as well as targeted cancer
cell therapy. A major barrier in the use of nanotechnology for brain tumor applications is the difficulty in
delivering nanoparticles to intracranial tumors. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP; 10 nm in core size) conjugated to a purified antibody that selectively binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) deletion
mutant (EGFRvIII) present on human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells were used for therapeutic targeting and MRI contrast enhancement of experimental glioblastoma, both in vitro and in vivo, after convectionenhanced delivery (CED). A significant decrease in glioblastoma cell survival was observed after nanoparticle
treatment and no toxicity was observed with treatment of human astrocytes (P < 0.001). Lower EGFR phosphorylation was found in glioblastoma cells after EGFRvIIIAb-IONP treatment. Apoptosis was determined to
be the mode of cell death after treatment of GBM cells and glioblastoma stem cell–containing neurospheres
with EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs. MRI-guided CED of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs allowed for the initial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles within or adjacent to intracranial human xenograft tumors and continued dispersion days
later. A significant increase in animal survival was found after CED of magnetic nanoparticles (P < 0.01)
in mice implanted with highly tumorigenic glioblastoma xenografts (U87ΔEGFRvIII). IONPs conjugated to
an antibody specific to the EGFRvIII deletion mutant constitutively expressed by human glioblastoma tumors
can provide selective MRI contrast enhancement of tumor cells and targeted therapy of infiltrative glioblastoma cells after CED. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6303–12. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Despite the use of conventional therapeutic modalities
such as surgery, chemotherapy, and ionizing radiation, the
prognosis in patients with malignant gliomas remains poor
(1). Virtually all glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors,
the most common malignant glioma, recur at the site of their
initial treatment due to the presence of infiltrating cancer
cells in the surrounding normal brain that resist therapy or
go untreated. Infiltrating cancer cells include a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) shown to be integral

to tumor development, perpetuation, and therapy resistance
(2, 3). Imaging and targeted therapy of infiltrating GBM cells
within the normal brain remain limited.
The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is a tumor-specific mutation that is expressed in malignant gliomas and not in the normal brain. This mutation
encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that enhances
tumorigenicity and accounts for radiation and chemotherapy
resistance (4, 5). The 801-bp in-frame deletion in the extracellular domain of the EGFR results in the fusion of normally distant EGFR gene and protein sequences (6, 7). The
14-amino-acid fusion junction sequence has been chemically
synthesized and used to create an anti–synthetic peptide
antibody that is highly specific for the deletion mutant EGFR
protein compared with the intact EGFR protein (8, 9). Vaccination of the fusion junction peptide sequence has been
shown to be efficacious immunotherapy in syngeneic murine
models and in humans with two consecutive and one multiinstitutional phase II trials (10).
The magnetic nanoparticle has emerged as a potential multifunctional clinical tool that can provide cancer cell detection
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement
as well as therapy by cancer cell–targeted delivery of therapeutic agents (antibodies, drugs, and small-molecule inhibitors)

or by local hyperthermia generated by absorbing energy from
an alternating magnetic field. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP)
in the size range of 10 to 25 nm have unique magnetic properties, generating significant transverse T2 relaxation time
shortening and susceptibility effects resulting in strong T2weighted contrast on MRI (11). IONPs can evade the immune
system and target cancer cells for destruction while simultaneously providing MRI contrast. Most IONPs are biodegradable and considered to have low toxicity (12). IONPs have
been used in the clinical setting with humans (13). Currently,
various formulations of IONPs have been developed for drug
delivery schemes (14), magnetic cell separation and cell targeting (15), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement (16–20), and hyperthermia treatment of cancer (17, 21–23).
Cell-specific imaging by nanotechnology for detection and
treatment monitoring holds great promise for the therapy of
various cancers including central nervous system (CNS)
tumors (24, 25). However, a major barrier in the use of nanotechnology for brain tumor applications is the difficulty in
delivering nanoparticles to intracranial tumors. Conventional
systemic delivery is limited due to the nonspecific nanoparticle uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and problems
in penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Convectionenhanced delivery (CED) is a minimally invasive surgical
procedure that provides fluid convection in the brain by a
pressure gradient that bypasses the BBB. Therapeutic agents
can be delivered into the brain by CED in high concentrations (26, 27) without toxicity to normal tissue and organs
commonly associated with systemic delivery. The use of
CED can also allow for therapeutic targeting of infiltrating
cancer cells, a major cause for brain tumor recurrence after
surgery. We report the use of IONPs conjugated to an anti–
synthetic peptide antibody (EGFRvIIIAb) specific to the deletion-mutant EGFR for image-guided CED in a mouse glioma
model. The EGFRvIIIAb-IONP complex can provide MRI
contrast enhancement of human glioblastoma cells in vitro
and an antitumor effect both in vitro and in vivo after CED.

Materials and Methods
Animals, cells, and EGFRvIII antibody
The human glioblastoma cell line U87MG was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection within the last
6 months and maintained in standard culture conditions.
The U87MG cell line was stably transfected with either a
plasmid for overexpression of the deletion mutant EGFRvIII
(U87ΔEGFRvIII) or the wild-type (wt) EGFR (U87wtEGFR)
and tested by Western blot analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Neurospheres were harvested from patient GBM specimens (patients #74, 1002, and 30) at the time of surgical
resection and cultured using serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors. Patient tumor specimens were
harvested with approval by the Emory University Institutional
Review Board (protocol #642-2005). Glioblastoma neurospheres were tested by Western blot analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S2) for the GSC stem cell marker CD133 (Cell Signaling),
EGFRvIII (GenScript Corp.), and wt EGFR (Cell Signaling).

Overexpression of the deletion mutant EGFRvIII confers
enhanced tumorigenicity in immunocompromised rodents
(4). Six- to seven-week-old athymic nude (nu/nu) mice were
used, and all procedures were done with approval by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory
University. The IgG polyclonal EGFRvIII antibody (6 nm and
150 kDa) was generated by GenScript in rabbits and purified
as described in a prior publication (8). Briefly, the rabbit polyclonal EGFRvIIIAb represents an anti–synthetic peptide antibody that reacts to the fusion junction of the deletion mutant
EGFRvIII receptor expressed in human glioblastoma tumors.
IONP bioconjugation
Briefly, activation of the carboxyl groups on the IONPs was
performed for conjugation of the EGFRvIII antibody, after
addition of an activation buffer, ethyl dimethylaminopropyl
carbodiimide (EDC), and sulfo-NHS. The EDC/NHS solution
was mixed vigorously with the IONPs at 25°C for 15 minutes.
Excess EDC and sulfo-NHS were removed from the activated
nanoparticles by three rounds of centrifugation (1,000 × g)
and resuspension in PBS using Nanosep 10K MWCO OMEGA
membrane (Pall Life Sciences). The IONPs with activated
carboxyl groups were then reacted with the EGFRvIII antibody (50 μL at 2 mg/mL) at 25°C for 2 hours, and the reaction mixture was stored at 4°C overnight. Excess antibody
was removed by three rounds of centrifugation and resuspension in PBS using 300K MWCO OMEGA membranes.
Mobility shift in 1% agarose gel was visualized by staining
with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue in 45% methanol, 10%
acetic acid for 1 hours and destaining in 30% methanol,
10% acetic acid overnight (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Binding of IONPs to glioblastoma cells
Glioblastoma cells (U87ΔEGFRvIII) were seeded in triplicate in 60-mm flat-bottomed plates and incubated overnight
at 37°C. Confluent monolayers of cells (1 × 106) were incubated
with the IONP or EGFRvIIIAb-IONP solution (0.15 mg/mL)
for 1 or 2 hours for MRI experiments. Washing of cells was
performed with 10% PBS to remove the excess nanoparticle
solution. Treated cells were collected after scraping and placed
in 10-mL tubes containing warm 0.8% agarose solution. MRI
measurements were made with a 3-T clinical capable scanner.
The T2 relaxation times of cells treated with IONPs were
measured using a multi-echo fast spin echo sequence with
32 TE values ranging from 6 to 180 ms and an interval of
6 ms. The T2 relaxation time was calculated by fitting the
decay curve using the nonlinear monoexponential algorithm
of M(TE) = M0 × exp(−TE/T2). See Supplementary Methods
for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies.
Human astrocyte and glioblastoma cell IONP
toxicity studies
Human astrocytes were kindly provided by the Yong Laboratory at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The astrocytes were cultured based on a prior published protocol (28).
Toxicity experiments were performed on human astrocytes
seeded in triplicate in 48-well flat-bottomed plates (105 astrocytes per well). Cells were treated with free IONPs (0.3 mg/mL)

EGFRvIII-Targeted Therapy of GBM by IONPs after CED

or control vehicle (serum-free medium) for 1 hour at 37°C.
Glioblastoma cells (U87MG and U87ΔEGFRvIII) were seeded
in triplicate in 48-well flat-bottomed plates (80,000 cells per
well) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Confluent monolayers
of cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with control
(PBS), IONPs (0.2 mg/mL), EGFRvIIIAb (0.2 mg/mL), or EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (0.2 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then
washed with PBS and a crystal violet cell viability assay was
performed at 0, 1, and 3 days. Cells were stained with 100 μL
of crystal violet solution (1% crystal violet, 1% HCl, and 10%
ethanol) at 37°C for 30 minutes. Absorbance measurements
were performed on a microtiter plate reader at a wavelength
of 570 nm. Absorbance values are presented as the mean of
three wells per treatment ± SD.
Glioblastoma apoptosis and EGFR cellular signaling
studies after IONP treatment
Glioblastoma cells (U87MG, U87ΔEGFRvIII, and
U87wtEGFR) and neurospheres from patients #30 and
74 were seeded in six-well flat-bottomed plates (500,000 cells
per well) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Cells were treated
with control IgG (0.3 mg/mL), IONPs (0.3 mg/mL), EGFRvIIIAb (0.3 mg/mL), and EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (0.3 mg/mL)
for 2 to 3 hours in PBS at 37°C. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 1% NP40,
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors]. Western blot
analysis of protein levels was performed with cleaved
caspase-3 and caspase-3 primary antibodies (Cell Signaling)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
For EGFR signaling studies, glioblastoma cells were treated with control (PBS), IONPs (0.5 mg/mL), EGFRvIIIAb
(0.5 mg/mL), and EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (0.5 mg/mL) for 2 hours
in PBS at room temperature. Cell lysates were harvested
in RIPA buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L EDTA, and 1% NP40, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors]. Western blot analysis of protein levels was
performed with primary antibodies against phospho-EGFR
(Transduction Laboratories), phosho-Akt (Cell Signaling),
Akt (Cell Signaling), phospho-extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK)-44/42 (Cell Signaling), and ERK44/42 (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and a chemoluminescent HRP detection solution
(Denville Scientific, Inc.) were used to detect the proteins.
Tumor inoculation and IONP convection procedure
Anesthetized athymic nude mice were placed in the
stereotaxic instrument and U87ΔEGFRvIII cells (5 × 105)
were stereotactically inoculated into the right striatum,
3 mm below the dural surface, on day 0. On day 7 after tumor
implantation, mice were randomized into four groups: (a)
CED of HBSS (untreated control), (b) CED of IONPs, (c)
CED of EGFRvIIIAb, and (d) CED of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs.
All animals underwent CED of a 10-μL volume at a rate of
0.5 μL/min (20 minutes of total infusion) on day 7 using
the same coordinates as used earlier for tumor cell implantation. For the CED methods, see Supplementary Methods.

www.aacrjournals.org

The volume of distribution and volume of dispersion of
IONPs after CED
Mice inoculated with U87ΔEGFRvIII cells (5 × 105) were
also followed by MRI to investigate the initial volume of distribution (VD) and volume of dispersion (VDI) of IONPs over a
period of 11 days after CED. Animals underwent CED of
IONPs (n = 3 free IONPs and n = 3 EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs) as
described above on day 9 after tumor implantation. These
animals were scanned on a 4.7-T animal MRI scanner using
a dedicated mouse coil (Varian Unity) on days 0, 4, 7, and
11 after CED. The V D was determined for each animal
(n = 4) on days 0, 4, 7, and 11 after CED. The VDI of the IONPs
on days 4, 7, and 11 was determined by subtracting the VD at
day 0 from the VD calculations on days 4, 7, and 11 after CED
of the IONPs (e.g., VDI day 4 = VD day 4 − VD day 0). For VD
and VDI measurements, see Supplementary Methods.
Histology
Mouse brains were harvested and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin on days 7 and 9 after tumor implantation. Coronal sections were made at the level of the needle tract to
mark the center of the xenograft tumor. Serial sections of the
cerebral hemisphere were examined from each animal. Tissue
blocks were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 μm). Prussian blue staining was performed after slides of formalin-fixed
tissue were placed in a coplin jar containing a 1:1 mixture of 5%
potassium ferrocyanide and 5% HCl for 30 minutes at 37°C in a
water bath. The slides were rinsed well with distilled water
and counterstained with nuclear fast red for 20 minutes (Supplementary Fig. S4). EGFRvIII immunohistochemistry was
performed (day 7 after tumor implantation) after deparaffinization of tissue sections (Supplementary Fig. S5). The primary
rabbit polyclonal EGFRvIII antibody (GenScript) and a biotinylated antirabbit secondary antibody provided in a rabbit ABC
staining system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.
Animal survival studies
All athymic nude mice were observed daily to monitor
external appearance, feeding behavior, and locomotion.
Animals were sacrificed at the first sign of an adverse event
(paresis, inability to feed) and brains were removed.
Statistical analysis
Cell viability data represent the average of three independent absorbance values on day 3 of the crystal violet assay.
Statistical cell viability differences were assessed using unpaired two-sample Student's t test assuming equal variance.
Animal survival data were entered into Kaplan-Meier plots
and statistical analysis was performed using log-rank test.
P = 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

hydrophobic protective inner layer around a single crystal of
IONP with carboxylate groups in the outer layer for functionalization (29). Bioconjugation was performed with the aminoterminal fragment of the antibody and carboxyl groups on
the copolymer coating of the IONPs (Fig. 1). Confirmation of
the antibody conjugation to IONPs was performed by agarose
gel electrophoresis analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Confirmation of binding of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs to
human glioblastoma cells by MRI and TEM
The binding affinity of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs to human GBM
cells that overexpress the EGFRvIII mutated protein was
evaluated. The EGFRvIIIAb-IONP conjugate was able to selectively bind to U87ΔEGFRvIII cells and induce T2-weighted
MRI contrast enhancement after 1 and 2 hours of treatment
(Fig. 2; Table 1), as evidenced by the MRI signal drop compared with the control samples of cells treated with free
IONPs. Such strong T2 shortening and the magnetic susceptibility effects of IONPs lead to spin dephasing and substantial MRI signal drop, which generated a “darkening” contrast
as seen in the T2-weighted MR images. TEM confirmed binding of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs to the cell surface of EGFRvIIIexpressing glioblastoma cells as shown in Supplementary
Fig. S6. No evidence of endocytosis and endosome-filled
EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs was found in glioblastoma cells based
on TEM. In contrast, treatment of cells with free IONPs
revealed nonspecific cell surface binding, uptake, and
IONP-filled endosomes within the cytoplasm of U87ΔEGFRvIII
cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).
IONPs exhibit no toxicity to human astrocytes
To determine whether IONPs are toxic to human astrocytes, cells were treated with control vehicle (serum-free

medium) or IONPs (0.3 mg/mL) for 1 hour. After cell washing, a crystal violet cell viability assay was performed. There
was no significant toxicity found with human astrocytes
3 days after treatment with IONPs (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A).
Antitumor effect of IONPs on human glioblastoma cells
Human glioblastoma cells (U87-MG or U87ΔEGFRvIII)
were incubated with control (PBS), EGFRvIIIAb, IONPs, or
EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs for 1 hour (Fig. 3B and C). Cells were
washed and cell viability assay was performed at 0, 1, and
3 days after treatment. At day 3, there was a significant
decrease in cell survival in U87ΔEGFRvIII cells treated with
IONPs, EGFRvIIIAb, or EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (P < 0.001). There
was a less pronounced but statistically significant decrease in
cell survival in U87MG cells treated with IONPs, EGFRvIIIAb,
or EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (P < 0.01). Nonspecific uptake of free
IONPs likely accounts for cell toxicity and the antitumor effect
found in both glioblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Apoptosis as a mode of cell death of GBM
cell– and GSC-containing neurospheres after
EGFRvIIIAb-IONP treatment
Human glioblastoma cells (U87MG, U87ΔEGFRvIII, and
U87wtEGFR) and neurospheres were incubated with control
IgG, EGFRvIIIAb, IONPs, and EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (Fig. 4).
Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of cleaved
caspase-3 in glioblastoma cells (Fig. 4A) and neurospheres
(Fig. 4B) treated with EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs. No levels of cleaved
caspase-3 were found with treatment of glioblastoma cells
with free IONPs, control IgG, or EGFRvIIIAb. Elevated levels
of cleaved caspase-3 and apoptosis were found in human
glioblastoma neurospheres harvested from patients #30
and 74 after treatment with the EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs

EGFRvIII-Targeted Therapy of GBM by IONPs after CED

Figure 2. Binding of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs to human glioblastoma cells and
MRI contrast enhancement. The binding of EGFRvIIIAb-conjugated
IONPs to human GBM cells that overexpress the EGFRvIII mutated
protein was confirmed by MRI contrast changes (lower signal intensity
at longer TE in T2-weighted imaging and reduction of T2 values as
shown in Table 1B and C after 1 and 2 h of treatment) when compared
with the control samples of free IONPs (A).

(Fig. 4B). Glioblastoma neurospheres from patient #30 are
characterized by EGFRvIII, wt EGFR, and CD133 GSC marker
expression, whereas neurospheres from patient #74 express
wt EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Glioblastoma EGFR signaling and IONPs
Ligand activation of the EGFR leads to a series of downstream signaling events after phosphorylation and activation
(30, 31). Western blot analysis of EGFR cellular signaling
proteins was performed in glioblastoma cells (U87MG,
U87wtEGFR, and U87ΔEGFRvIII) treated with control (PBS),
IONPs, EGFRvIIIAb, or EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (Fig. 4C). Levels of
phosphorylated EGFR, phospho-Akt, Akt, ERK44/42, and phospho-ERK44/42 were determined. Both U87wtEGFR and
U87ΔEGFRvIII showed elevated levels of phosphorylated
EGFR as expected due to the overexpression of EGFR in these
cell lines. U87ΔEGFRvIII cells showed the greatest EGFR phosphorylation due to the constitutive activity of the EGFRvIII
receptor. Treatment of these cells with EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs
showed a lower level of EGFR phosphorylation. Treatment of
U87wtEGFR and U87ΔEGFRvIII glioblastoma cells with either
IONPs or EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs resulted in less phosphorylation
of Akt and no phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting that IONPs
may affect downstream EGFR signaling in glioblastoma cells.
Treatment of U87wtEGFR and U87ΔEGFRvIII glioblastoma
cells with EGFRvIIIAb alone resulted in increase in phosphorylated Akt and ERK levels.
CED of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs in a mouse glioma model
Athymic nude mice (n = 6) implanted with human GBM
xenografts that express the mutated EGFRvIII protein
(U87ΔEGFRvIII) underwent CED of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs
(n = 3) or IONPs (n = 3) in aqueous solution (0.2 mg/mL concentration; 10 μL volume; 0.5 μL/min rate for a total of
20 minutes) 9 days after tumor implantation. MRI was performed before CED to confirm proper growth of the xeno-

www.aacrjournals.org

graft in each mouse brain (Fig. 5) and then 0, 4, 7, and
11 days after CED of the nanoparticles to determine localization, initial VD, and VDI of the IONPs administered (Fig. 5).
Average VD values were 11.2, 19.2, 22.7, and 22.9 mm3 on
days 0, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. The averaged VDI values
were 8.0, 11.5, 15.5 mm3 on days 4, 7, and 11 after CED. There
was no statistically significant difference in the VD and VDI of
free IONPs and EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs. Prussian blue staining
was performed to confirm the presence of EGFRvIIIAbIONPs in human xenograft tumors and the surrounding
mouse brain after CED (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Several initial findings support the feasibility of the MRIguided CED of IONPs in human xenograft brain tumors: (a)
EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs can be distributed within or adjacent to
brain tumors with CED; (b) outstanding contrast induced by
IONPs enables MRI to monitor and follow the distribution of
the nanoparticle complex in the tumor and in the surrounding brain after CED; (c) intracerebral infusion is safe, as all
animals survived from the procedures and showed no signs
of toxicity; (d) CED led to a long retention of the EGFRvIIIAbconjugated nanoparticles and slow dispersion of the agents
at the tumor site as shown on MRI; (e) MRI can delineate and
quantify the extent of dispersion of the IONP complex after
CED with T2-weighted MRI.
Animal survival studies and therapeutic efficacy of
EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs after CED
Animal survival studies were performed in four groups of
mice implanted with highly tumorigenic U87ΔEGFRvIII
xenografts (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S5). Each group of
animals (n = 10) underwent CED of control (HBSS), unconjugated IONPs (0.2 mg/mL), EGFRvIIIAb (0.2 mg/mL), or
EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs (0.2 mg/mL) 7 days after tumor implantation. All the animals that underwent HBSS CED were dead
by 14 days after tumor implantation (median survival, 11 days).

Discussion
Accurate targeting and better delivery efficiency are two
major goals in the development of therapeutic agents for
the treatment of malignant brain tumors. Ideally, a therapeutic agent would be able to overcome the BBB and selectively be enriched in tumors with minimal toxicity to

EGFRvIII-Targeted Therapy of GBM by IONPs after CED

Figure 5. CED of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs in a mouse glioma model. A, examples of T2-weighted images of mouse brains (mouse 1 and mouse 2) show
the presence of intracranial xenograft (shown by white arrows) and reveal the localization, distribution, and dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles at
days 4 and 7 after CED (shown by black arrows). T2-weighted MRI shows a decrease in signal after CED of IONPs. Areas with signal drop increased 7 d after
CED, showing dispersion of nanoparticles. B, initial nanoparticle VD after CED is shown at day 0. The VDI was determined at 4, 7, and 11 d after CED,
confirming dispersion of nanoparticles.

normal tissues. Conjugation of agents to antibodies or other
ligands that bind to antigens or receptors that are usually
abundantly or uniquely expressed on the tumor surface
represents a promising approach in the treatment of glioblastoma tumors (32, 33). Unfortunately, the ability to image therapeutic agents in the brain for adequate tumor
delivery and the proper assessment of treatment efficacy
remain limited.
The use of nanotechnology is now being applied to CNS
cancer applications (13, 25, 34–39). One potential problem

that can attenuate the targeted therapy and imaging of
CNS tumors by systemic delivery of nanoparticles is their
being “trapped” in the liver, spleen, and circulating macrophages after i.v. administration due to nonspecific uptake.
Additionally, systemic delivery is also limited by the BBB,
nontargeted distribution, and systemic toxicity. CED is an
approach developed to overcome the obstacles associated
with current CNS agent delivery (26, 27, 40) and is increasingly used to distribute therapeutic agents for treatment of
malignant gliomas (27). Recently, multiple clinical trials

have been performed using CED for the treatment of recurrent GBM (32, 33, 41). In CED, a small hydrostatic pressure differential imposed by a syringe pump to distribute
infusate directly to small or large regions of the CNS is
used in a safe, reliable, targeted, and homogeneous manner
(42). Difficulty in CED imaging of therapeutic agents in the
brain is one major limitation of this approach. Groups
have radiolabeled their therapeutic agent, co-infused their
agent with radiolabeled albumin (123I-labeled albumin), or
used liposomes containing an MRI contrast agent (e.g., gadoteridol) for CED imaging (33, 43, 44). Radiolabeling of
therapeutic agents relies on single-photon emission computerized tomography for agent imaging, which is a lowresolution imaging modality of the brain. Co-infusion of
an MRI contrast agent or radiolabeled albumin may not
allow for precise therapeutic agent distribution analysis
in the brain due to the differences in molecular weight
and surface properties between each infusate. Recently,
CED of biodegradable, nonfunctionalized maghemite magnetic nanoparticles has been depicted by MRI in a normal
rat brain model (45). Direct imaging of magnetic nanoparticles by MRI can permit distribution studies of nanoparticles in the brain after CED.
Currently, two major types of systemic anti-EGFR agents
have entered the clinical setting: anti-EGFR antibodies and
small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (46–48).
These agents have shown modest efficacy in patients with
GBM tumors. The development of new agents that can target
the EGFR deletion mutant EGFRvIII can permit direct targeting of glioblastoma cells while sparing the normal brain
(9, 49–52). Furthermore, the targeting of GSCs and/or GSCspecific molecules (e.g., CD133) may form the basis of more
effective treatments against glioblastoma tumors and prevention of relapse (2).
We report for the first time the use of IONPs bioconjugated to an EGFRvIII deletion mutant antibody for MRIassisted CED and targeted therapy of human glioblastoma.
The bioconjugated EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs permit MRI contrast
enhancement or “darkening” of U87ΔEGFRvIII cells with
T2-weighted MRI. The EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs caused a significant decrease in glioblastoma cell survival, and a greater
antitumor effect was found after treatment of EGFRvIIIexpressing glioblastoma cells with EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs in
comparison with human glioblastoma cells, which did not
express the EGFR. This provided further evidence of a biomarker-targeting effect by the EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs. The pronounced antitumor effect of free IONPs in glioblastoma
cells is likely due to the nonspecific uptake of the nanoparticles by the tumor cells. Uptake of IONPs by glioma cells has
been shown in culture and in vivo in the past (53, 54). The
influence of surface functionalization has recently been
shown to enhance the internalization of magnetic nanoparticles in cancer cells (55). Our IONPs are functionalized
through surface coating of amphiphilic polymers, which
may promote uptake within glioblastoma cells and result
in cell toxicity.
No significant toxicity was found with IONP treatment in
human astrocytes or in animals after intracerebral adminis-

tration. No toxicity to human astrocytes and a significant killing effect of both free IONPs and EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs form the
basis of targeted therapy of GBM cells in the brain. Apoptosis
was determined to be a mode of cell death after treatment of
glioblastoma cells and neurospheres by the conjugate EGFRvIIIAb-IONP. Apoptosis was found after treatment of GSCcontaining neurospheres harvested from a glioblastoma
patient (patient #30) with elevated expression of EGFRvIII
and the GSC marker CD133. Although we were not able to
find apoptosis induction in glioblastoma cells after treatment
with free IONPs or the EGFRvIIIAb alone, a significant antitumor effect was found both in vitro and in our animal survival studies. Mechanistic studies suggest that EGFR
downstream signaling may be affected by IONPs with less
EGFR phosphorylation after glioblastoma cell treatment with
EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs. Furthermore, IONPs resulted in less
phosphorylation of Akt and ERK in glioblastoma cells overexpressing the EGFR.
CED of IONPs in a mouse glioma model results in MRI
contrast of the nanoparticles and effective intratumoral
and peritumoral distribution of nanoparticles in the brain.
A significant therapeutic effect was found after CED of
both IONPs and EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs in mice. Dispersion
of the nanoparticles over days, after the infusion has finished, may potentially target infiltrating tumor cells outside the tumor mass that are potentially responsible for
tumor recurrence and the demise of patients. Use of
bioconjugated magnetic nanoparticles may permit the
advancement of CED in the treatment of malignant gliomas due to their sensitive imaging qualities on standard
T2-weighted MRI and therapeutic effects. Better targeting
of infiltrative glioblastoma tumors by MRI-guided CED of
magnetic nanoparticles may provide more effective treatment of these devastating brain tumors. We recognize that
the rodent model may not be the ideal animal model
to study CED; however, our studies provide a proof-ofprinciple concept for future CED studies using other cancer nanotechnology agents.
In conclusion, the preclinical use of IONPs conjugated to a
glioblastoma-specific antibody may form the basis of a future
clinical trial of image-guided CED of magnetic nanoparticles
for patients with glioblastoma tumors.
