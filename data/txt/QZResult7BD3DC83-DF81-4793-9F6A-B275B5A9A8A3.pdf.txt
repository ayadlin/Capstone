Abstract
Cellular microtubules composed of a-b-tubulin heterodimers that are essential for cell shape, division, and
intracellular transport are valid targets for anticancer therapy. However, not all the conserved but differentially
expressed members of the b-tubulin gene superfamily have been investigated for their role in these settings. In this
study, we examined roles for the hematologic isoform b-tubulin VI and functional genetic variants in the gene.
b-tubulin VI was highly expressed in blood cells with a substantial interindividual variability (seven-fold variation
in mRNA). We characterized DNA missense variations leading to Q43P, T274M, and R307H, and a rare nonsense
variant, Y55X. Because variations in the hematologic target of microtubule-binding drugs might alter their
myelosuppressive action, we tested their effect in cell lines stably expressing the different b-tubulin VI full-length
variants, ﬁnding that the T274M change signiﬁcantly decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced tubulin
polymerization. Furthermore, patients treated with paclitaxel and carrying b-tubulin VI T274M exhibited a
signiﬁcantly lower thrombocytopenia than wild-type homozygous patients (P ¼ 0.031). Together, our ﬁndings
deﬁne b-tubulin VI as a hematologic isotype with signiﬁcant genetic variation in humans that may affect the
myelosuppresive action of microtubule-binding drugs. A polymorphism found in a tubulin isoform expressed
only in hemapoietic cells may contribute to the patient variation in myelosuppression that occurs after treatment with microtubule-binding drugs. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4744–52. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Microtubules are ubiquitous and highly dynamic polymers
of a-b-tubulin heterodimers indispensable for a variety of
cellular functions such as structure maintenance, intracellular
transport, cell signaling, migration, and mitosis. Several of the
most common chemotherapeutic drugs, such as taxanes,
vinca-alkaloids, and epothilones, base their mechanism of
action on binding to microtubules and altering their dynamics,
which leads to mitosis arrest and cell death (1, 2). The therapeutic target of these drugs is b-tubulin, which consists of 8

isotypes encoded by multiple genes that exhibit a tissuespeciﬁc expression. In a previous study, we showed that
isotypes I, IVb, and V are constitutive, isotypes IIa, IIb, III, and
IVa are neuronal, and isotype VI is hematopoietic cell-speciﬁc
and was detected in platelets, lymphocytes, bone marrow, and
spleen (3, 4). The b-tubulin isotypes are highly conserved and
have similar sequences, however, the C-terminal region exhibits higher variability and seems to confer differences in
microtubule polymerization and stability. The fact that rare
mutations in b-tubulin IIb and III lead to a spectrum of severe
neuronal disorders suggests speciﬁc functions that cannot be
compensated by alternative isotypes (5, 6). b-Tubulin VI
knockout mice studies proved a specialized role for this protein
in platelet synthesis, structure, and function (7, 8).
Because of the crucial role of b-tubulin in cells, genetic
variation is not allowed. However, the hematologic isotype VI is
an exception, and a common missense polymorphism (Q43P)
has been associated with an altered risk of cardiovascular
disease by modulating platelet function and structure (9, 10).
There is also a report on a rare b-tubulin VI missense variant
(R318W) responsible for congenital macrothrombocytopenia
(11). Other genetic variations in b-tubulin isotypes correspond
to cell lines and lead to acquired resistance to microtubulebinding drugs (12–14). Variations in b-tubulin isotype composition in tumors have also been associated with decreased
sensitivity to these drugs (15–18). Thus, polymorphisms in
b-tubulin VI, leading to a variant protein or altered expression,

b-Tubulin VI Variability and Paclitaxel Toxicity

might result in differences in the effect of b-tubulin–binding
drugs among patients. Because of the hematologic role of
b-tubulin VI, these polymorphisms could affect the action of
the drugs in blood cells, leading to interpatient differences in
myelosupression. However, at the moment, the expression of
b-tubulin VI has not been well-established, and polymorphisms in this gene have not been investigated.
In this study, we characterized b-tubulin VI expression in
hematologic cells and screened for genetic variation by
sequencing the coding region of the b-tubulin VI gene (TUBB1).
We generated cell lines stably expressing the variant b-tubulin
VI proteins detected and conducted functional assays. Furthermore, the clinical implications of these polymorphisms
were studied in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with paclitaxel.

Materials and Methods
Human samples and patients
cDNAs from 7 different blood fractions were obtained from
BD Biosciences (Human Blood Fractions MTC Panel), peripheral blood lymphocytes, platelets, and neutrophils were isolated from healthy volunteers, and CD34 bone marrow cells
were isolated from bone marrow aspiration following previously described procedures (19). Frozen samples from peripheral T-cell lymphomas were collected through the Spanish
National Cancer Centre (Madrid, Spain) tumor bank network
from pathology departments of different hospitals in Spain
(20). The main characteristics of this human material and cell
lines used for mRNA quantiﬁcation are shown in Supplementary Table S1. For the estimation of allele and haplotype
frequencies, we used DNA isolated from unrelated individuals
from different ethnic groups, speciﬁcally, 481 Caucasians from
Spain, 106 Asians from China, and 71 Africans from Tanzania.
Forty-nine patients with hematologic malignancies planned
for autologous transplant (20 with lymphoma, 15 with multiple
myeloma, and 14 with acute leukemia), who underwent mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells with paclitaxel
170 mg/m2 i.v. by continuous infusion for 24 hours followed
by 8 mg/kg s.c. recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) daily, and that had leukapheresis
product available, were included in the study (21). In this
series, recruited between 1999 to 2008, the time elapsed from
the last cytotoxic treatment was at least 3 weeks, to allow
recovery of peripheral blood counts before paclitaxel administration. Peripheral blood counts were assessed on days 5, 7,
and daily afterward. Maximal hematologic toxicity was
retrospectively assessed and recorded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.
The characteristics of the patients, including age at treatment,
previous treatments, state of disease at stem cell harvest, weeks
from the last treatment, and baseline platelet counts at paclitaxel treatment initiation are provided in Supplementary
Table S3.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from blood cells, cell lines, and frozen
tumoral tissue using TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center

www.aacrjournals.org

Inc.) and the concentration quantiﬁed by using Nanodrop ND1000 (Wilmington). One microgram of total RNA was reverse
transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and an oligo dT14
primer following the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA
content of the different b-tubulin isotypes was quantiﬁed by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) with the
Sequence Detection System 7900HT (Applied Biosystems)
using conditions, primers, and probes previously described
(4). Normalization was carried out with the internal standard
b-glucuronidase (GUS). Negative controls were present in all
PCR series and assays were carried out in triplicates. The DDCt
method (22) was used for the calculation of mRNA content.
DNA isolation, sequencing, and genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood
lymphocytes of the healthy volunteers and from the leukapheresis product of the hematologic patients using FlexiGene DNA
Kit (QIAGEN), and the DNA concentration was determined
using PicoGreen dsDNA quantiﬁcation reagent (Invitrogen).
For TUBB1 sequencing, the exons and proximal promoter
region were ampliﬁed by PCR using speciﬁc primers designed
to avoid cross-reactions with other b-tubulin isotype genes/
pseudogenes (Supplementary Table S2). PCR ampliﬁcation
products were puriﬁed using the PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (QIAGEN) and run on an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer capillary
sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Genotyping for the TUBB1
coding polymorphisms was conducted in duplicates with the
KASPar SNP Genotyping System (KBiosciences) using 15 ng of
genomic DNA. All assays included DNA samples with known
genotypes and negative controls. The sequence detection
system 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) was used for ﬂuorescence detection and allele assignment.
Platelet activation and aggregation assays
The effect of b-tubulin VI R307H polymorphism in platelet
function was investigated by conducting aggregation assays in
6 healthy volunteers of known genotype (3 women homozygous for the wild-type allele and 2 women and 1 man homozygous for the variant allele). Platelet aggregation was measured in nonadjusted-citrated platelet-rich plasma obtained by
centrifuging blood at 140  g for 12 minutes. Platelets were
stimulated with 6-mer thrombin receptor agonist at 0.78 to
25 mmol/L (Sigma-Aldrich), collagen at 0.125 to 2 mg/mL
(Menarini Diagnostics), ADP at 0.16 to 0.5 mmol/L (Menarini
Diagnostics), arachidonic acid at 0.4 to 1.6 mmol/L (Bio-Rad),
and ristocetin at 0.75 to 1.25 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich). Changes
in light transmission of platelet-rich plasma over baseline were
recorded for 5 minutes using an Aggrecorder II aggregometer
(Menarini Diagnostics).
Generation of cell lines expressing b-tubulin VI wild-type
and variant proteins
We ampliﬁed the full coding sequence of TUBB1 using
speciﬁc primers that introduced NheI and NotI cleavage sites
(Supplementary Table S2) and cDNA from peripheral blood
lymphocytes that carried in homozygosity the wild-type TUBB1
coding region. The PCR product was cloned into pIRESpuro2
vector (Clontech) to generate pIRESpuro2_TUBB1 wild-type

plasmid. By means of the GeneTailor Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's
indications and adequate primer pairs (Supplementary Table
S2), the pIRESpuro2_TUBB1 wild-type construct was used
to generate plasmids that contained TUBB1 sequence with
variants encoding for the following protein changes: Q43P,
Y55X, T274M, R307H, and T274M/R307H. Correct TUBB1
sequence and lack of artifacts was conﬁrmed by sequencing.
MCF7 breast cancer cells were provided by Dr M. Esteller
(IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain). MCF7 cells were chosen for
heterologous expression of b-tubulin VI based on their lack
of endogenous expression of this protein and sensitivity to
microtubule-binding drugs. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with the different TUBB1 constructs and the empty
vector by using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer's instructions. To generate stable cell lines, the
different TUBB1 constructs and the empty vector were electroporated using the Gene Pulser XCell Electroporation System
(Bio-Rad) into cells and 24 hours later, 0.5 mg/mL of puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added for selection. Puromycin-resistant
clones were analyzed for b-tubulin VI expression by Western
blot analysis. Control cells were also selected with puromycin, all resistant empty vector clones pooled together. Stable
transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin,
and puromycin at a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL.
b-Tubulin VI protein detection
For Western blotting, total cell extracts from cell lines were
separated by using the Criterion XT Gels Bis-Tris 10% and the
Criterion electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad) and transferred to
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (Immobilon-P Membrane,
Millipore) using the Trans Blot Semi-Dry Blotter (Bio-Rad).
Protein concentration was measured by using Bio-Rad Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad), and equal loading of proteins was veriﬁed by
Ponceau S staining. The membranes were blocked and then
incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody speciﬁc for human
b-tubulin VI (from Dr. Paraskevi Giannakakou; ref. 3), a mouse
antibody recognizing all b-tubulin isotypes (clone 2.1, Sigma;
1:1,000 dilution), or a rat anti-a–tubulin (clone YL1/2; Chemicon International; 1:1,000 dilution). After washing, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary
antibody: goat anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor 680 nm, Molecular
Probes; 1:15,000 dilution), goat anti-mouse (DyLight 800,
Thermo Scientiﬁc; 1:10,000 dilution), or donkey anti-rat (IRdye
800 nm, Rockland Immunochemicals; 1:15,000 dilution). The
ﬂuorescence signal was detected using the Odyssey infrared
imaging system (LI-COR).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was conducted as previously described (23). In brief, cells were cultivated on coverslips
overnight and ﬁxed the next day with 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with Triton-X-100 0.5% in TBS, and blocked with
10% goat serum. The same primary antibodies as those
described for Western blotting were used. Speciﬁc secondary
antibodies, Alexa-rabbit-405 nm and Alexa-rat 568 nm, were
used. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 5 LIVE confocal
microscope using a 40/1.3 EC Plan Neoﬂuar objective, a 63/
1.4 Plan APOCHROMAT objective, and 100/1.4 Plan APOC-

4746

Cancer Res; 72(18) September 15, 2012

HROMAT objectives. All images were acquired and analyzed
using Zeiss LSM 5 LIVE software.
Tubulin polymerization assay
Quantitative drug-induced tubulin polymerization assays
were conducted as previously described (12). In brief, cells
were grown in 24-well plates overnight and incubated for
6 hours with paclitaxel at concentrations of 0, 10, 100, and
1,000 nmol/L. The cells were washed twice with PBS before
lysis at 37 C for 5 minutes in the dark with 100 mL of hypotonic
buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L
EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P40) containing protease inhibitors
(Protease Cocktail inhibitor tablets; Roche). The lysates were
transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, rinsed with 100 mL of
hypotonic buffer, mixed by vortexing, and centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature. The 200 mL supernatants containing soluble (cytosolic) tubulin were transferred
to another tube, and pellets containing polymerized (cytoskeletal) tubulin were resuspended in 200 mL of hypotonic buffer.
The cytosolic and cytoskeletal fractions were each mixed with
electrophoresis sample buffer, sonicated, boiled, and analyzed
by immunoblotting. The percentage of polymerized tubulin
was determined by dividing the densitometry value of polymerized tubulin by the total tubulin content (the sum of the
densitometry values of soluble and polymerized tubulin) in at
least 3 independent experiments.
Statistical analysis
The myelotoxicity of the patients was analyzed taking into
account gender, age at paclitaxel treatment, type of disease,
previous treatments, state of disease at stem cell harvest, weeks
from last treatment, and baseline platelet counts at the initiation of paclitaxel and genotypes. For the analysis, quantitative
variables were dichotomized according to the median. To
include previous chemotherapy as a covariable, we used a
bone marrow toxicity scoring system, which takes into account
drugs and number of chemotherapy cycles used (24). This
chemotherapy score correlates with damage to the stem cell
pool caused by previous chemotherapy and with the ability to
mobilize hematopoietic cells (25, 26). Acute leukemias were
excluded from this analysis because, although treatments only
include low/medium myelotoxic drugs and they have low
chemotherapy score, the intense dosages in these protocols
cause prolonged aplasias (Supplementary Table S3). The c2
test and Fisher exact test were used to compare the hematologic toxicity grade of patients with clinical variables and
genotype. To correct for the possible effect of previous treatments on the thrombocytopenia, the Mantel–Haenszel test
was used. Nominal 2-sided P values < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were carried out
using SPSS software package version 17.0 (SPSS).

platelets, lymphocytes, bone marrow, and spleen; however, a
detailed characterization of b-tubulin VI expression has not
been conducted. Here, we show that b-tubulin VI mRNA was
detected in all blood samples tested with the highest expression corresponding to erythrocytes, platelets, and monocytes
(cells of myeloid origin; Fig. 1A). To further investigate the
expression of b-tubulin VI, we also determined b-tubulin VI
mRNA content in hematologic malignancies by studying
tumoral cell lines and samples. Again, cells of myeloid origin
showed higher expression than those of lymphoid origin, with
the megakaryocytic MC-3 and CHRF288-11 cell lines showing
the highest expression levels (Fig. 1B).
To conﬁrm the relevance of b-tubulin VI in blood cells, we
studied its expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes from
100 healthy volunteers. Figure 2A shows that isotype VI was the
major b-tubulin component of lymphocyte microtubules, followed by b-tubulins IVb and I, accounting for 82, 10, and 7.5% of
the total b-tubulin content, respectively. Interestingly, b-tubulin VI mRNA content was subjected to a substantial interindividual variability (7.2-fold variation in expression; Fig. 2B). To
substantiate this variability, we also measured the expression
of the ubiquitous and highly conserved b-tubulins IVb and I in
the same samples, ﬁnding a 2.5- and 2.2-fold variation in mRNA
content, respectively (data not shown).
TUBB1 gene has common missense polymorphisms
To determine whether TUBB1 gene could differentiate from
the other b-tubulin isotypes and be subjected to common
genetic variability, we sequenced the 4 exons and part of the 50
and 30 untranslated region of TUBB1 in genomic DNA from 20

unrelated Caucasians. In addition to the already studied missense polymorphisms, rs463312 (Q43P) and rs415064 (Q43H),
we found 2 other nucleotide changes leading to amino acid
changes, rs35565630 (T274M) and rs6070697 (R307H), and one
resulting in a premature stop codon (c.585G>A; Y55X). To
determine the allelic frequency of these genetic variations, we
conducted genotyping in a series of unrelated Caucasians,
Asians, and Africans (Table 1). The nucleotide change leading
to an early stop codon was only detected in the initial case used
for sequencing. Regarding the other variants, the polymorphism
leading to R307H was the most frequent, followed by those
corresponding to Q43P, Q43H, and T274M, this latter not
detected in Asians. When we established the haplotypes formed
by these missense variants (Table 1), we found that, as previously observed, rs463312 and rs415064 were in total linkage
disequilibrium resulting exclusively in Q43P. rs35565630 was
found only in the presence of rs6070697, thus, encoding a protein
with 2 amino acid changes (T274M and R307H), whereas a
relatively high number of cases carried only rs6070697 (R307H).
Concerning the putative effect of the TUBB1 coding variants,
previous results have shown that Q43P affects cardiovascular
risk through an alteration of platelet aggregation. To determine
whether the newly described missense polymorphisms could
also alter platelets function, we isolated DNA from 100 healthy
volunteers and identiﬁed individuals carrying the variants in
homozygosity. For T274M, we could not ﬁnd homozygous
variant individuals, thus, we conducted platelet activation and
aggregation assays only for rs6070697 (R307H) and wild type
homozygous individuals; however, we did not detect signiﬁcant differences (data not shown). In addition, we tested

whether the missense polymorphisms could be associated with
an altered TUBB1 mRNA content and thus explain the interindividual variation found in the expression of this gene (Fig.
2B); however, none of the polymorphisms was signiﬁcantly
associated with an altered mRNA content (data not shown).
Sequencing of TUBB1 proximal promoter region in individuals
with maximal and minimal mRNA content did not identify
polymorphisms associated with the expression of the gene.
b-Tubulin VI T274M alters paclitaxel effect on tubulin
polymerization and is associated with decreased
thrombocytopenia in patients treated with paclitaxel
To test the effect of the TUBB1 missense polymorphisms,
we carried out transient transfections using appropriated

expression vectors in MCF7 cells. These cells are derived from
a solid tumor and do not express b-tubulin VI protein. As shown
in Fig. 3A and B, the exogenously expressed b-tubulin VI
proteins were correctly produced and colocalized with a-tubulin, indicating a correct incorporation into the cytoskeleton of
the transfected cells. Cells stably expressing the different
b-tubulin VI proteins were used to study tubulin polymerization
after treatment with increasing amounts of paclitaxel. We found
that in control cells, transfected with the empty vector, most
of the cellular b-tubulin shifted to a polymerized form at
100 nmol/L paclitaxel. This same effect was also appreciated
in cells expressing wild-type, Q43P, and R307H b-tubulin VI
proteins. However, cells expressing T274M and T274M/R307H
variant proteins had signiﬁcantly higher amounts of soluble

were lysed and the polymerized (P) and the soluble (S) tubulin fractions were separated by centrifugation, loaded on adjacent lanes in SDS-PAGE, and
immunoblotted with an antibody against total b-tubulin. No statistically signiﬁcant differences were found for any of the variant proteins, except for those with
T274M. Arrows indicate the lanes with signiﬁcant differences. D, the percentage of polymerized (%P) and soluble (%S) tubulin was determined by
dividing the densitometric value of polymerized (P) and soluble (S) tubulin by the total tubulin content (P þ S). The bars in the graph represent the mean values
of 3 different experiments.

b-tubulin at 100 nmol/L paclitaxel (P ¼ 0.011; see Fig. 3C and D).
These results suggest that b-tubulin VI T274M variant protein is
less sensitive to the polymerization effect of paclitaxel.
Because b-tubulin VI is a hematologic isotype, we investigated whether b-tubulin VI T274M patients could be less
sensitive to the myelosuppressive effect of paclitaxel. To determine this, we genotyped a series of 49 patients with nonsolid
tumors scheduled for autologous transplant treated for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells with paclitaxel
170 mg/m2 i.v. by continuous infusion for 24 hours, followed
by 8 mg/kg s.c. rhG-CSF daily. With this highly myelosupressive
protocol, grades III and IV leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 55% and 43% of patients, respectively. We did
not ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant association between clinical
variables (e.g. type of disease, previous treatments, state of
disease at stem cell harvest, weeks from last treatment, and
platelet counts at baseline before the initiation of treatment
with paclitaxel) and the hematologic toxicity of the patients;
however, we found a statistically signiﬁcant effect for T274M
polymorphism. Heterozygous T274M patients showed significantly lower thrombocytopenia than homozygous wild-type
subjects. The 2 T274M patients exhibited grade I toxicity,
whereas 85% of homozygous wild-type patients developed
higher thrombocytopenia grades (II, III, or IV; P ¼ 0.031; Fig.
4). The association was also signiﬁcant (Mantel–Haenszel test,

www.aacrjournals.org

P ¼ 0.028) when the previous chemotherapy treatments were
taken into account. No signiﬁcant association was found
between T274M and neutropenia. We also genotyped the
patients for Q43P and R307H variants and, as expected, no
differences in thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were found
(data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we show that b-tubulin VI is a hematologyspeciﬁc isotype subjected to a substantial genetic difference
that is likely contributing to the interindividual variability
observed in the myelosuppressive effect of paclitaxel. A thorough characterization of b-tubulin VI expression in cells of
hematopoietic lineage revealed a high b-tubulin VI expression
not only in lymphocytes and platelets, as previously described
(3, 4), but also in most blood cells and several hematologic
malignancies (Fig. 1). These data and the lack of b-tubulin VI in
nonhematopoietic tissues (4) indicate that this is a hematology-speciﬁc isotype, and hence a major target mediating the
hematologic toxicity of the b-tubulin–binding drugs. In contrast, the low expression of this isotype in hematologic malignancies of lymphoid origin does not support a major role of the
b-tubulin VI in the physiopathology of these diseases. Furthermore, we found substantial interindividual variability in

b-tubulin VI mRNA content and common amino acid changes
affecting TUBB1 gene (Fig. 2 and Table 1).
So far, b-tubulin isotype genes have been considered highly
conserved (27); however, here we prove that b-tubulin VI
differentiates in this respect from the rest of isotypes and
exhibits common variation in the coding region. b-tubulin VI
Q43P was previously described and associated with a reduced
risk of arterial thrombosis and an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage by modulating the platelet function and
structure (9, 10). In addition, a rare b-tubulin VI variant,
R318W, was described in a case of congenital macrothrombocytopenia (11). In this study, a nonsense variant (Y55X) was
detected in heterozygosity; however, no deviations from normal ranges were found in the hemograms of this individual. So
far, all the b-tubulin pathogenic variants are missense mutations (5, 6, 11), suggesting that early truncated proteins, that do
not integrate into microtubules, might not be as damaging as
variant proteins that lead to altered dynamic instability of
microtubules (5, 6). This is in agreement with the lack of Y55X
phenotype. The R307H polymorphism is located in a conserved
region encoding b-tubulin VI M-loop; however, computational
algorithms (PolyPhen and SIFT) predicted a benign variant and
we found no signiﬁcant effects on platelet activation and
aggregation. T274M change also affects a conserved amino
acid in the M-loop and was predicted as probably damaging by
PolyPhen and SIFT; however, we detect this variant in the
general population, suggesting it will not substantially alter its
function. In regard to the microtubule-targeted drugs, residue
274 is located near the taxanes binding site (28).
We found that cells stably expressing b-tubulin VI 274M
variant, alone or in combination with 307H, were less sensitive
to the polymerizing effect of paclitaxel compared with control
cells transfected with the empty vector and those expressing

b-tubulin VI wild-type, 43P, and 307H variant proteins (Fig. 3).
Human b-tubulin isotypes are essentially invariant within
paclitaxel-binding site and, speciﬁcally, residue 274 is evolutionarily conserved in all vertebrate b-tubulins and all known
b-tubulin isotypes in these organisms (29). Interestingly, residue 274 clusters in a space that has been identiﬁed as essential
for interaction of paclitaxel with tubulin and an acquired
mutation in residue 274 of b-tubulin I (T274I) renders cell
lines resistant to paclitaxel and epothilone A (28, 30). These
data suggest that variants affecting threonine 274 can lead to
impaired drug binding and, thus, patients carrying the T274M
variant could be resistant to the myelosuppressive effects of
these microtubule-binding drugs. To investigate the impact of
this polymorphism in patients and its potential as a marker
of hematologic toxicity, we worked with a series of patients
treated with paclitaxel. Because paclitaxel hematologic toxicity
greatly depends on the time used for drug infusion (31), we
decided to work with an outstanding set of 49 patients treated
with a highly myelosuppressive protocol used for mobilization
of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Although only 2 patients
were T274M carriers, they showed a statistically signiﬁcant
lower grade of thrombocytopenia (P ¼ 0.031; Fig. 4), suggesting
that TUBB1 T274M conferred protection against this paclitaxel toxicity. It is important to highlight that the T274M
carriers had similar characteristics than the noncarriers in
terms of age, disease state, base line platelets, and chemotherapy score (Supplementary Table S3). With respect to the type of
disease, both were patients with myeloma with treatments that
have an important effect on platelet production. Concerning
the interval from last chemotherapy, the two carriers were
among the patients with shorter times. No signiﬁcant associations were found for leukocytopenia, but the results are
inconclusive, because patients were treated with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate the production
of neutrophils, and this is an important confounding factor.
The effect found for T274M in thrombocytopenia risk is
supported by the critical role that b-tubulin VI plays in platelets, showed both in knockout mice (7) and in patients carrying
a mutation in this gene (11). Although in these previous studies,
no pathogenic phenotypes were reported in neutrophils, we
detected high contents of b-tubulin VI in these cells (Fig. 1A).
This, together with the fact that the microtubule-binding agent
2-methoxyestradiol does not have an effect on b-tubulin VI (3)
and does not result in any type of myelosupression (32),
supports a function of this isotype also in neutrophils and
consequently in drug induced neutropenia. The similar structure of paclitaxel and docetaxel, which share the binding
domain with epothilones, and the fact that cell lines expressing
b-tubulin I T274I are resistant to all of these agents (28),
warrants further studies to investigate the role of T274M in
the hematologic toxicity of these drugs. It can be estimated that
approximately 7% of Caucasians carry T274M and might show
differences in myelosupression.
In summary, this is the ﬁrst study showing that b-tubulin VI
is a hematology-speciﬁc isotype that differentiates from other
b-tubulin genes by relevant genetic and expression variability.
In addition, we show that b-tubulin VI T274M decreases the
effect of paclitaxel on tubulin polymerization and, although
