Abstract
Mus81 plays an integral role in the maintenance of genome
stability and DNA repair in mammalian cells. Deficiency of
Mus81 in human and mouse cells results in hypersensitivity to
interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents and elevated levels of
genomic instability. Furthermore, Mus81-mutant mice are
susceptible to spontaneous lymphomas. The role of cellular
checkpoints in mediating the phenotypes observed in Mus81deficient cells and mice is currently unknown. In this study,
we have observed increased activation of p53 in Mus81 /
cells in response to ICL-induced DNA damage. In addition,
p53 inactivation completely rescued the ICL hypersensitivity
of Mus81 / cells, signifying p53 is essential for the elimination of ICL-damaged cells in the absence of Mus81. Confirming
that p53 acts as a critical checkpoint for the Mus81 repair
pathway, a synergistic increase of spontaneous and ICLinduced genomic instability was observed in Mus81 / p53 /
cells. To clarify the genetic interactions of Mus81 and p53
in tumor suppression, we monitored Mus81 / p53 / and
control mice for the development of spontaneous tumors.
Significantly, we show that loss of even a single allele of Mus81
drastically modifies the tumor spectrum of p53-mutant mice
and increases their predisposition to developing sarcomas.
Our results reveal a key role for p53 in mediating the response
to spontaneous and ICL-induced DNA damage that occurs in
the absence of Mus81. Furthermore, our data show that loss
of Mus81, in addition to p53, is a key step in sarcoma
development. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8527–35]

Introduction
DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents, such as cisplatin and
mitomycin C (MMC), are commonly used as antitumor agents in
the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers (1). The therapeutic
use of these drugs has generated increased interest in understanding the mechanisms by which ICLs are repaired in mammalian
cells. ICL agents disrupt replication of the genome by inducing the
formation of stalled replication forks, which, in turn, can collapse
into broken forks that can lead to double-strand breaks (DSB) and
chromosomal rearrangements (2). ICL agents also interfere with

critical cellular processes, such as transcription and recombination
(3). Yeast and bacterial studies have shown that both nucleotide
excision repair and homologous recombination pathways are
involved in ICL repair, but the mechanisms of mammalian ICL
and stalled replication fork repair remain poorly characterized (4–7).
Mus81 (methyl methanesulfonate, UV sensitive, clone 81) was
first identified in yeast as a member of the XPF family of
endonucleases that physically interacts with the cell cycle
checkpoint protein Cds1 (yeast homologue of mammalian Chk2)
and the DNA repair protein Rad54 (8, 9). Studies in yeast identified
that Mus81 and its binding partner Eme1 formed a DNA structurespecific endonuclease (10–13). Yeast mutants of Mus81 were found
to be sensitive to DNA-damaging agents that induce stalled
replication forks but not DSBs (8, 9). Meiotic defects in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants for Mus81 suggested that
the Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease plays a key role in Holliday junction
resolution (9). Subsequent in vitro studies indicated that the yeast
Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease is involved in the resolution of nicked
Holliday junctions that may arise during recombination and repair
processes. However, recent studies have indicated that the
mammalian Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease preferentially cleaves
stalled replication fork intermediates and has weak Holliday
junction resolution activity (14–17). Furthermore, Mus81 / mice
were found to be fertile, indicating that mammalian Mus81 is
dispensable for the processing of Holliday junctions that may arise
during meiosis (18, 19). Cellular phenotypes of Mus81-deficient
murine and human cells include exquisite sensitivity to ICL agents
and elevated levels of spontaneous and MMC-induced genomic
instability (18–20). Importantly, our previous study showed that
Mus81+/ and Mus81 / mice spontaneously develop tumors, thus
establishing Mus81 as a novel haploinsufficient tumor suppressor
gene (18).
The mechanisms underlying the ICL sensitivity of Mus81deficient cells have not yet been elucidated but may involve the
activation of p53-dependent or p53-independent cellular checkpoints. Moreover, the role that p53 plays in suppressing the
genome instability and tumors associated with Mus81 deficiency
still remains to be addressed. In this study, we have generated
double-knockout Mus81 / p53 / mice and addressed the effect
of dual loss of p53 and Mus81 on development, DNA damage
responses, genomic instability, and cancer. Our data show that
p53 inactivation rescues the ICL sensitivity of Mus81-deficient
cells at the expense of increased genomic instability. Dual
inactivation of p53 and Mus81 in mice resulted in accelerated
tumorigenesis, showing cooperativity of these tumor suppressors
in cancer. Furthermore, Mus81 mutation altered the tumor
spectrum of p53 / mice. p53 / mice predominantly developed

thymic lymphomas, whereas Mus81-mutant mice developed mainly
T-cell or B-cell lymphomas; however, Mus81 +/ p53 / and
Mus81 / p53 / mice were drastically predisposed to sarcomas
and multiple tumors. Our study indicates that p53 plays a critical
role in DNA damage responses in Mus81-deficient cells and
shows that Mus81 plays an essential role in suppressing sarcoma
formation in p53 / mice.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Mus81+/ mice (18) were crossed with p53 / mice (Taconic) to
obtain Mus81+/ p53+/ mice. Double heterozygote mice were then crossed
to obtain Mus81+/ p53 / and Mus81 / p53 / mice. All mice studied
were in a mixed 129/J  C57BL/6 genetic background and were genotyped
by PCR (primer sequences and PCR conditions available on request). All
experiments were done in compliance with the Ontario Cancer Institute
animal care committee guidelines.
Flow cytometry. Thymocytes, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow
cells were harvested from 8- to 12-week-old mice and stained with the
following monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen): anti-CD4, anti-CD8, antiThy-1, anti-B220, anti-TCRah, anti-CD43, and anti-IgM. Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analyses were done using a FACSCalibur
(Becton Dickinson).
Proliferation assay. For proliferation in response to T-cell stimuli,
lymph nodes were isolated and 5  105 cells were placed into roundbottomed 96-well plates in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, and 1%
h-mercaptoethanol) and stimulated in triplicate with soluble anti-CD3
(5 Ag/mL) with or without anti-CD28 (1 Ag/mL) or interleukin-2 (IL-2;
50 units/mL). Cells were pulsed for the last 18 h with 1 ACi [3H]thymidine
(Amersham) per well and harvested at 48 and 72 h after treatment.
Similarly, proliferation of B cells was assessed using 5  105 splenocytes
stimulated with anti-IgM (20 Ag/mL; Jackson ImmunoResearch) with or
without anti-CD40 (5 Ag/mL; PharMingen) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
10 Ag/mL; Sigma).
Cell cycle analysis. Peripheral T lymphocytes were grown on platebound anti-CD3 and culture medium for 24 h followed by a 1-day culture in
the presence of murine IL-2 (50 units/mL). The activated cells were treated
with 0.5 Ag/mL MMC (Sigma) for 18 h. Cells were spun down and washed
thrice with PBS and resuspended in fresh medium and cultured for an
additional 18 h. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, and DNA was stained with
5 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Sigma) as described previously (21).
Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining. Peripheral
T lymphocytes were stained with 5 Amol/L carboxyfluorescein diacetate

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and then activated with plate-bound anti-CD3
and culture medium for 24 h followed by a 1-day culture in the presence of
murine IL-2 (50 units/mL). Untreated and 0.1 Ag/mL MMC-treated
lymphocytes were grown for an additional 72 h. Cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry to determine CFSE levels, and population values were
determined using FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star).
Western blot analysis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were plated
on 10-cm plates at 30% to 40% confluency and cultured in the presence of
0 to 25 Ag/mL of MMC for 0 to 24 h. Protein cell extracts were prepared
using 3% NP40 lysis buffer, and Western blots were done using rabbit
polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (FL-393, 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti–phosphorylated p53 (Ser15; 1:200 dilution;
Cell Signaling), an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against
amino acids 190 to 211 of murine Mus81 (1:500 dilution), antitubulin
(1:1,000 dilution; Sigma), and antiactin (1:1,000 dilution; Sigma).
Genomic instability analysis. Splenocytes were harvested from mice of
8 to 12 weeks of age and cultured in medium containing 10 Ag/mL LPS for
48 h in the presence or absence of MMC (40 ng/mL). Cells were then
incubated with colcemid (0.1 Ag/mL) for 4 h, harvested, and treated with
hypotonic buffer (0.075 mol/L KCl) at 37jC for 15 min. After fixation in icecold methanol/acetic acid (3:1) buffer, cells were dropped onto glass slides
and stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) and chromosome number and gross chromosomal rearrangements were determined
for a minimum of 60 metaphase spreads per cell type as described
previously (18).
Histology. Tumor and normal tissue paraffin sections were evaluated by
H&E staining in conjunction with anti-Ki-67, anti-CD31, anti-CD3, and antiB220 staining of adjacent sections as described previously (21).
Bone marrow colony forming assay. Bone marrow cells were derived
from femurs of 6-week-old mice. Bones were isolated and flushed with
culture medium. Cells were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes at a density of
1  105/mL in MethoCult GF M3434 medium (Stemcell Technologies, Inc.).
MMC (0–40 ng/mL) was added to the cell suspensions just before plating.
Colonies were counted 10 days after plating.
;-Irradiation sensitivity. T lymphocytes were irradiated with 0, 2, or
4 Gy. Viability was assessed 12 h after irradiation by doing 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining (Sigma).

Results
Mus81 / cells express elevated levels of p53 in response to
DNA damage. Although studies have shown that Mus81 plays an
important role in the response of cells to DNA-damaging agents,

evidence describing the molecular mechanisms that underlie
Mus81-mediated DNA repair is lacking (9, 18, 20). As such, we
first addressed if Mus81 expression is altered in response to DNA
damage by examining the effect of the ICL agent MMC on MEFs
(Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis showed that Mus81 expression
levels remained unchanged in cells treated with 10 Ag/mL MMC for
4, 8, or 24 h. To confirm that the MMC did induce genotoxic stress
in the treated MEFs, we examined the expression of p53 as it is upregulated in response to MMC-induced damage (22). Elevated
levels of p53 were observed 24 h after treatment with 10 Ag/mL
MMC, confirming that the MMC was inducing a damage response.
To assess the effect of Mus81 mutation on p53 activation, we
generated Mus81 / MEFs. Similar to their wild-type (WT)
controls, Mus81 / MEFs did not show elevated basal levels of
p53 expression (Fig. 1B) and their proliferation was unaffected
(Supplementary Fig. S1). However, Western blot analysis indicated
increased levels of p53 induction in Mus81 / MEFs compared
with WT MEFs treated with 10 and 25 Ag/mL of MMC (Fig. 1B).
In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated at Ser15 by
apical kinases, such as DNA-dependent protein kinase and ataxiatelangiectasia mutated, resulting in its activation. To evaluate
if MMC-induced damage results not only in increased expression
but also in activation of p53 in Mus81 / cells, we examined
phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C).
We observed increased Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 in Mus81 /
MEFs compared with WT MEFs as early as 4 h after treatment
with 10 Ag/mL MMC, showing that Mus81 / cells exhibit

elevated levels of p53 activation in response to ICL-induced
damage.
In accordance with our previous study (18), Mus81 / MEFs
displayed increased cellular sensitivity to MMC (P = 0.03 for
10 Ag/mL; Fig. 1D). Our data suggest that the increased activation
of p53 observed in Mus81 / cells following MMC treatment
plays an important role in the ICL hypersensitivity of Mus81deficient cells.
Combined p53 and Mus81 deficiency leads to female
embryonic lethality. Mus81-deficient mice are predisposed to
developing lymphomas presumably due to elevated levels of
genomic instability, a hallmark feature of carcinogenesis. However,
cancer involves multiple genetic alterations, including loss of
cellular checkpoints (23). We hypothesized that the p53 tumor
suppressor pathway plays an important role in suppressing the
genomic instability and tumorigenesis in Mus81-deficient mice and
in the hypersensitivity of Mus81-deficient cells to ICL-induced DNA
damage.
To identify the functional interactions between p53 and
Mus81, double-knockout mice deficient for Mus81 and p53 were
generated. Surprisingly, our crosses to generate Mus81+/ p53 /
and Mus81 / p53 / mice did not yield the expected Mendelian
ratios (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The number of Mus81 / p53 /
offspring (47 mice) was much lower than expected (86 mice). Of the
47 offspring, only 3 were females, indicating that the observed
decreased viability of Mus81 / p53 / mice was female specific
(P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, we observed a

significantly reduced number of female Mus81+/ p53 / mice (only
1 female of 20 Mus81+/ p53 / mice). Analysis of embryos at day
9.5 of gestation indicated that 24% of Mus81 / p53 / females
displayed exencephaly, a defect in neural tube closure (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Previous studies have shown that loss of p53
results in a reduction of female progeny (10–30% depending
on background) due to a variety of developmental abnormalities
(24, 25). From our double heterozygote crossings (Mu81+/ p53+/
 Mus81+/ p53+/ ), we noticed a slight but not significant
deficiency in p53 / females (P > 0.1; Supplementary Table S1).
Our findings show that Mus81 mutation drastically enhances the
embryonic lethality associated with p53-null females.
Deficiency of p53 and Mus81 does not affect immune cell
differentiation and proliferation. Male Mus81 / p53 / mice are
fertile and seem undistinguishable from their WT, Mus81 / , or
p53 / littermates. Cell counts and determination of the various
immune cell populations by FACS analysis of thymus, lymph node,
spleen, and bone marrow indicated that the development of the
immune system of Mus81 / p53 / males was not compromised
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The effect of dual loss of p53 and Mus81
on the in vitro proliferative capacity of T and B cells derived from
adult mice was also assessed. No significant differences were
observed in the activation-induced proliferation of T and B cells

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

from Mus81 / p53 / mice when compared with single mutant and
and WT cells (Fig. 2A and B).
These data indicate that combined loss of Mus81 and p53 in
male mice does not affect their embryonic development or the
development of their immune system. In addition, combined loss
of Mus81 and p53 does not alter the proliferative capacities of
T and B cells derived from adult males.
Mus81 is dispensable for the response to ;-irradiation–
induced DNA damage. p53 is critical for initiating cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation (26). We previously
reported that Mus81 mutation does not impair the cellular
response to g-irradiation–induced DNA damage (18). To investigate the effect of combined loss of Mus81 and p53 in g-irradiation
sensitivity, we assessed the viability of lymphocytes 12 h after
irradiation using 7-AAD staining (Fig. 2C). As expected, p53 /
lymphocytes were highly resistant to g-irradiation compared with
WT cells. Mus81-null cells displayed a modest but not significant
sensitivity to g-irradiation compared with WT cells (P > 0.1).
Importantly, Mus81 / p53 / cells displayed equivalent g-irradiation resistance when compared with p53 / cells. These findings
show that Mus81 does not play a significant role in cellular
responses to g-irradiation and its inactivation does not impair the
resistance of p53 / cells to g-irradiation–induced DNA damage.
Loss of p53 rescues the MMC sensitivity of Mus81-deficient
cells. Mus81 deficiency increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents in yeast and mammals (8, 9, 18–20). In particular, loss of
mammalian Mus81 results in hypersensitivity to MMC. We have
shown that MMC-induced DNA damage results in elevated levels
and activation of p53 in Mus81 / cells (Fig. 1A). To elucidate the
requirement of p53 for the DNA damage sensitivity of Mus81 /
cells, we examined the response of Mus81 / p53 / cells to MMC.
Because MEFs can lose cellular checkpoints and become
immortalized during in vitro culturing, we did colony forming
assays in the presence or absence of MMC using primary bone
marrow cells isolated from 6-week-old WT, Mus81 / , p53 / , and
Mus81 / p53 / mice. Colony formation was assessed at day 10 of
culture and colony numbers were normalized to untreated controls
to determine the sensitivity to MMC (Fig. 2D). Mus81-deficient
bone marrow cells were found to be 6-fold more sensitive to MMC
than WT cells (P < 0.01; colony survival: 13 F 1% for Mus81 / and
79 F 4% for WT cells). p53-null cells displayed a modest but not
significant resistance to MMC compared with WT cells (colony
survival: 91 F 11% for p53 / and 79 F 4% for WT cells).
Remarkably, loss of p53 completely rescued the MMC sensitivity
of Mus81 / cells, as Mus81 / p53 / cells displayed similar sensitivity as WT cells (colony survival: 78 F 5% for Mus81 / p53 /
and 79 F 4% for WT cells). These data confirm the MMC
hypersensitivity of Mus81 / cells and show that p53 plays a
critical role in mediating this sensitivity.
Having determined that Mus81 / cells display clonogenic
sensitivity to MMC, we questioned if this sensitivity is due to a
proliferative defect of Mus81 / cells in response to ICLs. To assess for
this possibility, we examined the proliferation of Mus81 / cells and
their controls by doing CFSE staining on activated lymphocytes
(Fig. 3A). In response to MMC, the proliferation of Mus81 / cells was
hampered the greatest, as we observed an 81% reduction in proliferation compared with a reduction of only 66% in WT cells and
20% in p53 / cells. Strikingly, Mus81 / p53 / displayed only a
23% decrease in cellular proliferation in response to MMC. These data
show that Mus81 / cells have impaired proliferation in response
to MMC and that this reduction in proliferation is p53 dependent.

p53 and Mus81 in Genome Stability and Cancer

Role of p53 in the G2 arrest of MMC-treated Mus81 / cells.
DNA damage sensitivity and genomic instability in cells are often
accompanied by cell cycle progression defects. Because Mus81deficient cells are hypersensitive and display impaired proliferation
in response to ICLs, we examined the cell cycle progression of WT,
Mus81 / , p53 / , and Mus81 / p53 / activated lymphocytes in
the absence and presence of MMC-induced damage. WT, Mus81 / ,
p53 / , and Mus81 / p53 / cells displayed similar cell cycle
profiles in untreated conditions (Fig. 3B). Treatment with MMC for
18 h resulted in a significant accumulation of Mus81 / cells in the
G2 phase (39%, an increase of 20% compared with untreated cells),
whereas only a moderate accumulation of WT cells in the G2 phase
was observed (28%, an increase of 11% compared with untreated
cells). In contrast to WT and Mus81 / cells, p53 / cells (22%,
an increase of 1% compared with untreated cells) did not display
a G2 accumulation in response to MMC. Significantly, loss of
p53 diminished the arrest of Mus81 / cells in the G2 phase, as
Mus81 / p53 / cells (25%, an increase of 8% compared with
untreated cells) displayed only a slight G2 accumulation. Taken
together, our data show that the ICL repair defect of Mus81-null
cells results in an accumulation of cells in the G2 phase and that
this accumulation is at least partially dependent on p53.
p53 suppresses Mus81-associated genomic instability. Previous reports have shown that Mus81 / cells have increased
levels of spontaneous genomic instability (18–20). Unexpectedly,
Mus81 / cells have comparable survival and proliferation rates
and do not have elevated levels of p53 in the absence of MMC by

comparison with WT cells. This may be explained by the fact that
only a small fraction of Mus81 / cells have increased genomic
instability (<10%); therefore, it may be difficult to detect changes in
proliferation and p53 expression at a population level under these
conditions. Therefore, we analyzed metaphase spreads of splenocytes from WT, Mus81 / , p53 / , and Mus81 / p53 / mice for
chromosomal aberrations to evaluate the role of p53 in suppressing
the genomic instability occurring in the absence of Mus81 (Fig. 4A
and B). In untreated conditions, Mus81 / (9.8 F 1% of total
metaphases) and p53 / cells (7.3 F 3% of total metaphases)
displayed elevated genomic instability compared with WT cells
(0.8 F 1% of total metaphases). Increased aneuploidy and
chromosomal breaks were observed in Mus81 / cells (5.3 F
0.1% and 6.2 F 1%, respectively) in comparison with WT cells
(0% and 0.8 F 1%, respectively). p53 / cells also displayed an
increase in aneuploidy but only a mild increase in spontaneous
chromosomal breaks (7.3 F 1.5% and 3.6 F 2%, respectively).
Remarkably, combined loss of Mus81 and p53 resulted in f3-fold
increase in spontaneous genomic instability compared with
Mus81 / cells and 4-fold increase compared with p53 / cells,
as 28% of Mus81 / p53 / metaphases displayed chromosomal
aberrations. Elevated levels of aneuploidy (12.9 F 3%), chromosomal breaks (12 F 0.5%), and triradial-like structures (2.4 F 1%)
were observed in Mus81 / p53 / metaphases.
Because Mus81 / cells are particularly sensitive to MMC, we
examinedthelevelofgenomicinstabilityinWT,Mus81 / ,p53 / ,and
and Mus81 / p53 / cells that were treated with 40 ng/mL MMC.

Elevated rates of aneuploidy, chromosomal breaks, and triradiallike structures were observed in all four genotypes in response to
MMC. Strikingly, MMC treatment affected Mus81 / p53 / cells
the most, as they displayed the largest increase in total
chromosomal aberrations in response to MMC (98% compared
with 68%, 54%, and 38% increases for p53 / , Mus81 / , and WT
cells, respectively). Taken together, our data highlight the important
role of p53 in the suppression of genomic instability in Mus81 /
cells.
Cooperativity of p53 and Mus81 in tumor suppression. To
clarify the in vivo role of p53 in Mus81-associated tumorigenesis,
we monitored the health and survival of Mus81 / , p53 / ,
Mus81+/ p53 / , Mus81 / p53 / , and WT cohorts for a period
of 1 year (Fig. 5A). All moribund mice that were examined were
found to have tumors. Only 67% of Mus81 / mice (26 of 39;
mean survival, 44.7 weeks) and 15% of p53 / mice (3 of 20; mean
survival, 27.8 weeks) were viable and healthy at the end of the
year. Remarkably, no Mus81+/ p53 / mice (0 of 17; mean
survival, 25.6 weeks) or Mus81 / p53 / mice (0 of 20; mean
survival, 17.5 weeks) survived up to 1 year and all were moribund
by 47 and 30 weeks of age, respectively. Log-rank analysis
indicated that tumor latency was significantly decreased in
Mus81 / p53 / mice compared with p53 / or Mus81 / mice
(P < 0.001), showing that the combined loss of Mus81 and p53
cooperates in tumorigenesis.
Characterization of tumors was done by examination of cellular
morphology and staining of tissue sections with cell- and
proliferation-specific markers. Similar to our previous study (18),

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

the majority of sick Mus81 / mice that were examined were
found to be afflicted with T-cell or B-cell lymphomas (8 of 12,
66%; Supplementary Table S2). As has been described previously
(27), p53 / mice predominantly developed thymic lymphomas
(10 of 12, 83%). Interestingly, the combined loss of Mus81 and p53
led to a unique tumor spectrum, as 64% of Mus81 / p53 / mice
(9 of 14; Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 5B and C) developed
sarcomas. In contrast, only 8% of Mus81 / mice (1 of 12) and 17%
of p53 / mice (2 of 12) developed sarcomas (Supplementary
Table S2; Fig. 5B). In addition, Mus81 / p53 / mice also
developed T-cell or B-cell lymphomas, carcinomas, and thymic
lymphomas that are associated with inactivation of Mus81 or p53
(Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 5C, D, and H). Loss of one allele of
Mus81 in a p53-null background did not decrease tumor latency in
comparison with p53 / mice (P > 0.1; Fig. 5A) but did alter tumor
spectrum. Similar to Mus81 / p53 / mice, Mus81+/ p53 / mice
predominately developed sarcomas (7 of 12, 58%; Supplementary
Table S2; Fig. 5B and C), indicating that loss of one allele of
Mus81 is sufficient for increasing the predisposition of p53 / mice
to sarcomas (P < 0.01). Southern blot analysis of the Mus81 locus
was done on three sarcomas isolated from Mus81+/ p53 / mice
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We did not observe any gross genomic
alterations or loss of the Mus81 allele, indicating that loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) is not essential for the sarcoma development
in Mus81+/ p53 / -mutant background.
Combined loss of Mus81 and p53 not only resulted in decreased
tumor latency and changes in the tumor spectrum but also
promoted the incidence of multiple tumors (P < 0.01; Fig. 6).

p53 and Mus81 in Genome Stability and Cancer

Whereas only 8% of Mus81 / mice (1 of 12) and no p53 /
mice (0 of 12) developed multiple independent tumors, 43% of
Mus81 / p53 / mice examined (6 of 14) were characterized with
multiple tumors (Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 6A–C). Similarly,
Mus81+/ p53 / mice (6 of 12, 50%) also had an increased
incidence of multiple tumors, indicating that biallelic expression
of Mus81 is required for the suppression of multiple independent
tumors in a p53-null background.

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that Mus81 plays an important role
in the repair of ICL-induced structures, such as stalled replication
forks, primarily in the late S phase and G2 phase of the cell cycle
(12, 20, 28). The role of p53 in irradiation-induced cell cycle
checkpoints and DSB repair responses has been well documented.
However, the role of p53 in responding to stalled replication forks
remains poorly characterized. Elucidating the tumor suppressor
functions of p53 in the response to stalled replication forks is of
significant importance, as defective repair can predispose for
cancer and ICL agents, such as MMC, are frequently used for
cancer therapy.
To examine the cooperativity of Mus81 and p53 in DNA repair
responses and tumorigenesis, we generated Mus81 / p53 /

mice. Unexpectedly, we observed smaller litter sizes and abnormal Mendelian ratios for Mus81+/ p53 / and Mus81 / p53 /
pups. Sex genotyping and embryo analysis indicated that
Mus81 +/ p53 / and Mus81 / p53 / female embryos had
drastically reduced viability, showing that Mus81 is critical for
proper female embryonic development in the absence of p53.
Previous studies have identified that loss of p53 results in lethality
of a subset of females during embryonic development due to a
variety of developmental defects, including excencephaly (24, 25). It
has been speculated that the developmental defects in these mice
may be due to increased genomic instability in p53-mutant
backgrounds. Although the mechanisms behind the decreased
viability of Mus81 / p53 / and Mus81+/ p53 / female embryos
require further investigation, it may be linked at least partially to
the overall increased genomic instability observed in the absence of
Mus81 and p53. Our data establish a requirement for the biallelic
expression of Mus81 to suppress female-specific embryonic
lethality in the absence of p53.
Studies of embryonic stem cells, transformed MEFs, and mice
have shown that Mus81 deficiency leads to ICL sensitivity (18, 19).
In this study, we have examined the role that p53 plays in
mediating the MMC sensitivity of Mus81-deficient cells and have
found that Mus81 / cells display elevated levels of p53 in response

to MMC. Furthermore, inactivation of p53 rescued the MMC
sensitivity of Mus81 / cells to WT levels. Our data show that p53
is critical for the elimination of Mus81 / cells damaged by MMC.
Through its ability to arrest the cell cycle progression of cells with
DNA damage, p53 prevents amplification of chromosomal aberrations
that can otherwise lead to oncogenic-promoting genetic alterations.
By monitoring the proliferation of cells using CFSE staining and cell
cycle analysis, we have shown that the increased MMC sensitivity of
Mus81 / cells is due to a proliferative defect in response to ICLs,
resulting in an arrest of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.
Furthermore, we have shown that the G2 arrest of MMC-treated
Mus81 / cells is p53 dependent and speculate that the G2 arrest is
important in preventing the replication of cells that harbor
chromosomal aberrations due to defective ICL repair mechanisms.
Supporting this notion are reports describing other ICL-sensitive cells,
such as Fanconi anemia and Brca1-deficient cells, which display a G2
arrest in response to MMC (29, 30).
The predisposition of Mus81-mutant mice for T-cell and B-cell
lymphomas suggests that cellular checkpoints may play a critical role
in the suppression of tumors in other tissues. Our demonstration that
the loss of p53 in Mus81 / mice significantly accelerates tumorigenesis, and alters the tumor spectrum, leading to increased
susceptibility to multiple tumors and sarcomas, supports this notion.
Importantly, the elevated levels of genomic instability observed in
Mus81 / p53 / mice are correlated with accelerated tumorigenesis
and thus provide further evidence that genomic instability is the
driving force behind Mus81-associated tumorigenesis.
Unlike Mus81 / p53 / mice, Mus81+/ p53 / mice did not
display significantly decreased tumor latency. However, both
Mus81+/ p53 / and Mus81 / p53 / mice displayed a strong
shift in tumor spectrum toward sarcomas. Southern blot analysis
indicated that LOH of Mus81 is not required for sarcoma
development in p53 / background. We have previously shown
that loss of a single allele of Mus81 results in an f50% reduction in
protein levels and spontaneous genomic instability and tumor
susceptibility (18). Based on our findings in this study, we speculate

that a gene dosage reduction of Mus81 in p53-null mice promotes
the genetic alterations required for sarcoma development.
Several recent studies have indicated that p53 plays an
important role in the repair of stalled replication forks (31–33).
In fact, Subramanian and Griffith (34) have shown that cancerderived p53 mutants have weaker binding to stalled replication
forks. Because Mus81 is able to efficiently resolve stalled replication
forks in vitro, it is possible that Mus81 deficiency in vivo results in
an increase in the frequency of stalled forks and that the binding of
p53 to these structures is critical for repair by alternate pathways.
We suggest, in addition to the cell cycle and apoptotic functions of
p53, its role in stalled fork repair may play an important role in
maintaining genome stability and suppressing tumorigenesis of
Mus81 / mice. Whereas human studies have identified p53
inactivation as the most common genetic alteration leading to
sarcoma formation (35), no studies have yet linked mutation of
Mus81 or other molecules involved in ICL repair with sarcoma
formation. We have identified a novel role for Mus81 as a critical
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that collaborates with p53 in
suppressing sarcoma formation. Furthermore, our data warrant
investigation of the collaborative roles of human Mus81 and p53 in
cancer suppression, which will provide important insight into the
molecular mechanisms that underlie sarcoma initiation and
progression.
