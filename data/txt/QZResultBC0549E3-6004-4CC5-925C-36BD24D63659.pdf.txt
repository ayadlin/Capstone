Abstract
Identifying and understanding changes in cancer genomes is essential for the development of
targeted therapeutics1. Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon
tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and
copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include
several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes

such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for
significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint
kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and
corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq
data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin
family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO
fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in
the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO
fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and
several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for
therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most prevalent cancer, accounting for over 50,000
deaths per year in the United States2. Approximately 15% of CRCs have microsatellite
instability (MSI) arising from defects in the DNA mismatch-repair (MMR) system3,
whereas the other ∼85% of microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRCs are the result of chromosomal
instability3. Genomic studies have identified mutations in genes, chromosomal structural
variants and pathway alterations that probably contribute to CRC development3–6.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In an effort to understand better the pathogenesis of human CRCs we generated exome
sequences (72 tumour–normal pairs, 15 MSI and 57 MSS; Supplementary Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table 2), RNA-seq (68 tumour–normal pairs), Illumina 2.5M singlenucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) array data (74 tumour–normal pairs) and whole-genome
sequences (1 MSI and 1 MSS tumour–normal pair) for a set of 74 colon tumour–normal
pairs (Supplementary Table 1).

Exome sequencing identified 95,075 somatic mutations, of which 36,303 were protein
altering (Fig. 1a). Two MSS samples were hypermutated (24,830 and 5,780 mutations, of
which 9,479 and 2,332 were protein-altering mutations, respectively; Fig. 1a) and were not
included in background mutation-rate calculations. We found 12,153 somatic mutations in
55 MSS samples studied (3,922 missense, 289 nonsense, 6 stop lost, 69 essential splice site,
20 protein-altering insertions/deletions (indels), 1,584 synonymous, 4,375 intronic and 1,888
others) and 52,312 somatic mutations in the 15 MSI samples (18,436 missense, 929
nonsense, 22 stop lost, 436 essential splice site, 363 protein-altering indels, 8,065
synonymous, 16,675 intronic and 7,386 others) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 3, 4 and
5). About 98% (35,524 out of 36,303) of the protein-altering single-nucleotide variants
identified are new and are not reported in COSMIC v58 (ref. 7). We further confirmed a
subset of the mutations reported to be somatic using RNA-seq data and/or mass
spectrometry genotyping (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table 3). In addition, we confirmed the presence of aberrant/alternate
transcripts for 112 genes with canonical splice-site mutations using RNA-seq data
(Supplementary Table 4). We observed a mean non-synonymous mutation frequency of 2.8
mutations per 106 bases (31–149 coding-region mutations in 55 samples) for the MSS
samples and 47 mutations per 106 bases (764–3,113 coding-region mutations in 15 samples)
for the MSI samples, consistent with the MMR defect in the latter (Fig. 1a) and the presence
of alterations in one or more of the MMR genes in ∼80% of the samples (Supplementary
Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6). Consistent with previous mutation reports4,6,8, analysis
of base-level transitions and transversions at mutated sites using both exome and wholegenome sequencing (WGS) showed that C to T transitions were predominant in CRCs,
regardless of MMR status (Fig. 1b, c), except for the two hypermutated tumour samples,
which also showed a higher proportion of C to A and T to G transversions (Fig. 1b, c).

In an effort to understand the impact of the mutations on gene function we applied SIFT9,
PolyPhen10 and mCluster11 and found, based on at least two of the three methods, that 34%
of the somatic mutations probably have a functional consequence (Supplementary Table 3).
We applied a previously described Q score metric to rank significantly mutated cancer
genes12. In MSS samples, we identified 23 significantly mutated cancer genes (Q score, ≥ 1;
false discovery rate, ≤ 5%; Supplementary Table 7). The MSS CRC genes identified from
this analysis included previously reported genes such as KRAS, APC, TP53, SMAD4,
FBXW7 and PIK3CA and several new genes including the cell cycle checkpoint gene ATM
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 7). KRAS and TP53 were among the top mutated MSI
CRC genes; however, owing to the limited number of samples analysed, none of the genes
achieved statistical significance.
Of the 432 candidate CRC genes identified in colon cancer mouse model screens13,14, 356
were mutated in this study (Supplementary Table 8). Frequently mutated genes that
overlapped included KRAS, APC, SMAD4, FBXW7 and EP400, as well as genes involved
in chromatin remodelling such as SIN3A, SMARCA5, NCOR1 and histonemodifying
enzyme JARID2 (Supplementary Table 8). TCF12, a CRC gene identified in a mouse model
screen, was mutated in five of the MSI samples. A hotspot mutation in TCF12 at Arg 603
(three out of five mutations) was found within the TCF12 helix–loop–helix domain and
probably abolishes its DNA-binding ability (Fig. 2b).

Mutational hotspots are indicative of functionally relevant driver genes. In this study we
have identified 274 genes with hotspot mutations (Supplementary Table 9 and
Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), 40 of which were not previously reported in COSMIC7.
Comparison with mutations reported in COSMIC7 identified an additional 435 hotspot
mutations in 361 genes (Supplementary Table 10), 18 of which were also identified in
mouse CRC screens13,14 (Supplementary Table 8). Mutations in the TET family of genes
that encode methylcytosine dioxygenases have not been reported in CRC4,15. We found that
all three family members—TET1, TET2 and TET3—were mutated in our study (Fig. 2c). In
addition, ERBB3, which was mutated in 8% (6 out of 72) of the samples, contained multiple
hotspot mutations that were oncogenic, as reported in a separate study (B.S.J. et al.,
submitted).

The top differentially expressed genes identified using RNA-seq (Supporting Methods,
Supplementary Figs 6 and 7 and Supplementary Table 11) included FOXQ1 and CLDN1,
both of which have been implicated in colon tumorigenesis16. Notably, we also identified
IGF2 upregulation in 12% (8 out of 68) of the samples (Supplementary Fig. 7). Most (7 out
of 8) of the tumours with IGF2 overexpression also showed focal amplification of the IGF2
locus as measured by Illumina 2.5 M arrays (Supplementary Fig. 8). Overall, the
differentially expressed genes affect multiple signalling pathways, including Wnt and
glutamate receptor signalling (Supplementary Fig. 26 and Supplementary Table 12).
We assessed copy-number alterations in 74 tumour–normal pairs by applying GISTIC17 to
the circular binary segmented (CBS)18 copy-number data. In addition to the IGF2
amplifications, we found known amplifications involving KRAS (13%; 10 out of 74) and
MYC (23%; 17 out of 74) located in a broad amplicon on chromosome 8q (Supplementary
Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 13). Deletion involving FHIT, a tumour-suppressor gene19,
was observed in 30% (22 out of 74) of the samples (Supplementary Table 14 and
Supplementary Fig. 9). We also detected deletion of APC (8%; 6 out of 74), PTEN (4%; 3
out of 74) and SMAD3 (9%; 10 out of 74). SMAD4 and SMAD2 are both altered in 27%
(20 out of 74) of the samples and are located within 3 megabases (Mb) of each other on
chromosome 18q, which is frequently lost (Supplementary Fig. 9). Finally, we found
chromosome 20q to be frequently gained (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Using RNA-seq data we identified 36 rearrangements that result in gene fusions20, including
two recurrent ones (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 15). The recurrent
fusions found in MSS samples involve the R-spondin family members, RSPO2 (3%; 2 out of
68) and RSPO3 (8%; 5 out of 68). R-spondins are secreted proteins that can potentiate
canonical Wntsignalling21. The recurrent RSPO2 fusion identified in two tumour samples
involves EIF3E exon 1 and RSPO2 exon 2 (Fig. 3b). This fusion transcript is expected to
produce a functional RSPO2 protein driven by the EIF3E promoter (Fig. 3d). A second
RSPO2 fusion that was not expected to produce a functional protein, EIF3E(e1)–
RSPO2(e3), was also detected in the same samples (Supplementary Table 15). To confirm
the nature of the alteration at the genome level, we performed WGS of the tumours
containing RSPO2 fusions. Analysis of junction-spanning reads, mate-pair reads and copynumber data derived from the WGS data identified a 158 kilobases (kb) deletion in one
sample and a 113 kb deletion in the second sample, both of which places exon 1 of EIF3E in
close proximity to the 5′ end of RSPO2 (Supplementary Figs 11 and 12), further supporting
the fusions observed.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The RSPO3 gene fusions were observed in 5 out of 68 tumours and involve PTPRK as the
5′ partner. We identified two different RSPO3 fusion variants consisting of either exon 1 or
exon 7 of PTPRK and exon 2 of RSPO3 (Fig. 3f–h and Supplementary Fig. 13). WGS reads
from the five tumours expressing the RSPO3 fusions showed rearrangements involving a
simple (three samples) or a complex (two samples) inversion that places RSPO3 in
proximity to PTPRK on the same strand as PTPRK on chromosome 6q (Supplementary Figs
14–18). The PTPRK(e1)–RSPO3(e2) transcript found in four samples is an in-frame fusion
that preserves the entire coding sequence of RSPO3 and replaces its secretion signal
sequence with that of PTPRK (Fig. 3h). The PTPRK(e7)–RSPO3(e2) fusion, detected in one
sample, is also an in-frame fusion that encodes a ∼70 kDa protein consisting of the first 387
amino acids of PTPRK, including its secretion signal sequence, and the RSPO3 amino acids
34–272 lacking its native signal peptide (Supplementary Fig. 13c). Interestingly, RNA-seq
data showed that the expression of RSPO2 and RSPO3 in colon tumour samples containing
the fusions was elevated compared with the tumour samples lacking R-spondin fusions (Fig.
3e). Furthermore, all of the RSPO-positive fusion tumours expressed the potential R-spondin
receptors LGR4,LGR5 and LGR6 (refs 22–24), although LGR6 expression was lower
compared with LGR4 and LGR5 (Supplementary Fig. 19).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm the functional relevance of the R-spondin fusion proteins, we first expressed Rspondin fusion constructs in 293T cells and confirmed that the fusion proteins were
expressed and secreted as predicted (Fig. 4a). We then examined the biological activity of
the R-spondin fusions using a Wnt-responsive luciferase reporter, TOPbrite22–25. As
observed with wild-type RSPO2 and RSPO3, conditioned media from cells transfected with
RSPO fusion expression constructs led to activation of the Wnt pathway (Fig. 4b). The
observed activation, although apparent in the absence of exogenous Wnt, was further
potentiated in the presence of recombinant Wnt, consistent with the known role of Rspondins in Wnt signalling21–24. In addition to 293T cells, we confirmed the ability of
RSPO fusion proteins to activate Wnt signalling in HT-29, a human colon cancer cell line
(Supplementary Fig. 20).
To characterize further the RSPO gene fusions we analysed them in the context of other
mutations (Fig. 4c, d, Supplementary Figs 21 and 25 and Supplementary Table 16). We
found that most of the colon tumours carried alterations in Wnt, TGF-β, Rtk/Ras and TP53
pathways (Supplementary Figs 22–26). Interestingly, the RSPO2 and RSPO3 fusions were
mutually exclusive and occurred in tumours that did not contain APC mutations or copy loss
(Fig. 4d; P = 0.038, Fisher's exact test), with the exception of one tumour that contained an
RSPO2 fusion and a single APC allele (Fig. 4d). In addition, the RSPO gene fusions were

mutually exclusive with mutations in CTNNB1, another Wnt pathway gene that is mutated
in CRC. However, all the samples with RSPO gene fusions also carried a mutation in either
KRAS or BRAF (Supplementary Fig. 21). Most APC mutant samples also have Ras
pathway gene mutations, indicating that the RSPO gene fusions may function analogously to
APC mutations in promoting Wnt signalling during colon tumour development. This is
further supported by the fact that the RSPO fusion-positive tumours showed up regulation of
Wnt pathway target genes similar to tumours carrying APC mutations (Supplementary Fig.
27). Interestingly, transposon-based insertional mutagenesis screens in mouse models of
CRC identified Rspo2 as a top-candidate cancer gene14 (Supplementary Table 8).
Furthermore, analysis of these mouse colon tumours showed that the transposon insertions
were in most cases mutually exclusive between Apc and Rspo2 (Supplementary Fig. 28a),
confirming the mutual exclusivity observed in human samples. Most of the transposon
insertions in the mouse Rspo2 gene occur near the transcriptional start site in the same
orientation as the Rspo2 promoter, and probably lead to elevated Rspo2 expression
(Supplementary Fig. 28b). Consistent with this and with the elevated expression of RSPO
genes observed in human tumours, we found a ∼ 20-fold increase in Rspo2 messenger RNA
expression in a mouse tumour carrying a transposon insertion near the Rspo2 transcription
start site, compared with adjacent normal tissue (Supplementary Fig. 28c). Taken together,
our findings indicate that the R-spondins probably function as drivers in human CRCs.
Although further studies will be required to fully understand the role of R-spondin fusions in
CRC development, they represent attractive targets for antibody-based therapy in CRC
patients positive for R-spondin fusions. In addition, other therapeutic strategies that target
downstream components of the Wnt signalling cascade will probably be effective against
tumours positive for R-spondin fusions.

Methods
Samples, DNA and RNA preparation and MSI testing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Patient-matched fresh–frozen primary colon tumours and normal tissue samples with
appropriate Institutional Review Board approval and patient-informed consent were
obtained from commercial sources (Supplementary Table 1) and subjected to genomic
analysis described below. The human tissue samples used in the study were de-identified
(double-coded) before their use and hence the study using these samples is not considered
human subject research under the US Department of Humanand Health Services regulations
and related guidance (45 CFR Part 46). All tumour and normal tissues were subject to
pathology review. From a set of 90 paired tumour–normal samples we identified 74 sample
pairs for further analysis. Tumour DNA and RNA were extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep
DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen). Tumour samples were assessed for microsatellite instability using
an MSI detection kit (Promega).
Exome capture and sequencing
In total, 72 tumour samples and matched normal tissues were analysed by exome sequencing
(Supplementary Table 1). Exome capture was performed using SeqCap EZ human exome
library v2.0 (NimbleGen) consisting of 2.1 million empirically optimized long
oligonucleotides that target ∼30,000 coding genes (∼300,000 exons, total size 36.5 Mb). The
library is capable of capturing a total of 44.1Mb of the genome, including genes and exons
represented in RefSeq (Jan 2010), Consensus CDS Project (CCDS; Sept 2009) and miRBase
(v.14, Sept 2009). Exome-capture libraries generated were sequenced on HiSeq 2000
(Illumina). One lane of 2×75 base pair (bp) paired-end data were collected for each sample.
The targeted regions had a mean coverage of 179 × with 97.4% bases covered at ≥ 10 times
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).

RNA-seq

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA from 68 colon tumour and matched normal sample pairs was used to generate RNAseq libraries using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina). RNA-seq libraries were
multiplexed (two per lane) and sequenced on HiSeq 2000 as per manufacturer's
recommendation. We generated ∼30 million paired-end (2 × 5bp) sequencing reads per
sample (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Sequence data processing
All short-read data were evaluated for quality control using the Bioconductor ShortRead
package26. To confirm that all samples were identified correctly, all exome and RNA-seq
data variants that overlapped with the Illumina 2.5M array data were compared and checked
for consistency. An all-by-all sample comparison was done on germline variants to check
that all pairs were matched correctly between the respective patient tumour and matched
normal sample and correspondingly did not match with any other patient pair above a cutoff
of 90%.
Variant calling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sequencing reads were mapped to the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) human
genome (GRCh37/hg19) using Burrows–Wheeler alignment (BWA) software27 set to
default parameters. Local realignment, duplicate marking and raw variant calling were
performed as described previously28. Known germline variations represented in dbSNP
Build 13129, but not represented in COSMIC v548, were filtered out. In addition, variants
that were present in both the tumour and normal samples were removed as germline
variations. Remaining variations present in the tumour sample but absent in the matched
normal were predicted to be somatic. Predicted somatic variations were additionally filtered
to include only positions with a minimum of 10× coverage in both the tumour and matched
normal as well as an observed variant allele frequency of <3% in the matched normal and a
significant differencein variant allele counts using Fisher's exact test. To evaluate the
performance of this algorithm we randomly selected 807 protein-altering variants and
validated them using Sequenom nucleic acid technology as described previously13. Of these,
93% (753) validated as cancer specific, with the invalidated variants being equally split
between not being seen in the tumour and also being seen in the adjacent normal (germ line).
In addition, we also targeted and validated 164 mutations belonging to significant Q score
genes and 212 hotspot mutations using Sequenom mass spectrometry technology. All
variants that invalidated were removed from the final set. Indels were called using the
GATK Indel Genotyper Version 2, which reads both the tumour and normal BAM file for a
given pair28.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify additional variants that had a lower mean allele frequency or were affected by a
specific mapper, we included Sequenom validated variants using the following algorithm.
Reads were mapped to the UCSC human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using GSNAP30. Variants
seen at least twice at a given position and greater than 10% allele frequency were selected.
These variants were additionally filtered for significant biases in strand and position using
Fisher's exact test. In addition, variants that did not have adequate coverage in the adjacent
normal as determined as at least a 1% chance of being missed using a binomial distribution
at a normal allele frequency of 12.5% were excluded. All new protein-altering variants
identified by the second algorithm were validated by Sequenom, which resulted in a total of
515 additional variants. The effect of all non-synonymous somatic mutations on gene
function was predicted using SIFT10 and PolyPhen11. All variants were annotated using
Ensembl (release 59, http://www.ensembl.org).

Validation of somatic mutations and indels

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used single base pair extension followed by nucleic acid mass spectrometry (Sequenom)
to validate the predicted somatic mutations as described previously13. Tumour and matched
normal DNA were whole-genome amplified using the REPLI-g Whole Genome
Amplification Midi kit (Qiagen) and cleaned up as per manufacturer's recommendations.
Variants found as expected in the tumour but absent in the normal DNA were designated
somatic. Those that were present in both tumour and normal samples were classified as
germline. Variants that could not be validated in tumour or normal samples were designated
as failed. For indel validation we designed primers for PCR that generated an amplicon of
∼300bp that contained the indel region. We PCR-amplified the region in both tumour and
matched normal samples using Phusion (New England Biolabs) as per manufacturer's
instructions. We then purified the PCR products on a gel, isolated the relevant fragments and
Sanger-sequenced them. The sequencing trace files were analysed using Mutation Surveyor
(SoftGenetics). Indels that were present in the tumour and absent in the normal sample were
designated somatic and are reported in Supplementary Table 4.
Mutational significance and pathway analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We evaluated the mutational significance of genes using a previously described method13.
In brief, this method can identify genes that have more statistically significant proteinaltering mutations than what would be expected based on a calculated background-mutation
rate. The background-mutation rate is calculated for six different nucleotide mutation
categories (A, C, G, T, CG1, CG2), in which there was sufficient coverage (≥10×) in both
the tumour and matched normal sample. A non-synonymous to synonymous ratio, ri, was
calculated using a simulation of mutating all protein-coding nucleotides and seeing if the
resulting change would result in a synonymous or non-synonymous change. The background
mutation rate, fi, was determined by multiplying the number of synonymous somatic
variants by ri and normalizing by the total number of protein-coding nucleotides. The
number of expected mutations for a given gene was determined as the number of proteincoding bases multiplied by fi and integrated across all mutation categories. A P value was
calculated using a Poisson probability function given the expected and observed number of
mutations for each gene. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–
Hochberg method and the resulting Q values were converted to Q scores by taking the
negative log10 of the Q values with a maximum possible value of 16. Given that different
mutation rates existed for the MSI and MSS samples, Q scores were calculated separately
for each, with the two hypermutated samples being removed completely. To avoid
underestimating the background mutation rates, samples with less than 50% tumour content
were excluded from the analysis. Pathway mutational significance was also calculated as
previously described13, with the exception that the BioCarta Pathway database was used,
which was downloaded as part of the MSigDB31. For quilt plots a fourfold increase or
decrease compared with the matched normal was used as the cutoff (Fig. 4d and
Supplementary Figs 20–24). A log2 tumour to normal ratio of 0.585 and −0.7 was used for
copy-number gain and loss, respectively, for these plots. Samples where exome data were
not collected were excluded from the plot (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs 20–24), Only
samples with either a copy number change and/or a mutation are depicted. To help
differentiate single-copy from double-copy loss in MMR genes a cutoff of −1 was used for
copy-loss events (Supplementary Fig. 3)
WGS and analysis
Paired-end sequence reads were aligned to GRCh37 using BWA. Further processing of the
alignments to obtain mutation calls was done in a similar manner to the exome-sequencing
analysis using the GATK pipeline. Copy number was calculated by computing the number
of reads in 10-kb nonoverlapping bins and taking the tumour–normal ratio of these counts.

Chromosomal breakpoints were predicted using BreakDancer32. Genome plots were created
using Circos33. For detection of genomic alteration in tumours with RSPO fusion, reads
aligning to the genomic region containing the RSPO, EIF3E and PTPRK genes were
analysed further to reveal the deletions and insertions.
RNA-seq data analysis
RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human genome version GRCh37 using GSNAP30.
Expression counts per gene were obtained by counting the number of reads aligning
concordantly within a pair and uniquely to each gene locus as defined by CCDS. The gene
counts were then normalized for library size and subsequently variance stabilized using the
DESeq Bioconductor software package34. Differential gene expression was computed by
pairwise t-tests on the variance-stabilized counts followed by correction for multiple testing
using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.
SNP array data generation and analysis
Illumina HumanOmni2.5_4v1 arrays were used to assay 74 colon tumours and matched
normal for genotype, DNA copy and loss of heterozygosity at ∼2.5 million SNP positions.
These samples all passed our quality-control metrics for sample identity and data quality
(see below). A subset of 2,295,239 high-quality SNPs was selected for all analyses.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

After making modifications to permit use with Illumina array data, we applied the PICNIC35
algorithm to estimate total copy-number and allele-specific copy number/loss of
heterozygosity. Modifications included replacement of the segment-initialization component
with the CBS algorithm36, and adjustment of the prior distribution for background raw copynumber signal (adjusted mean of 0.7393 and s.d. of 0.05). For the pre-processing required by
PICNIC's hidden Markov model, we used a Bayesian model to estimate cluster centroids for
each SNP. For SNP k and genotype g, observed data in normal samples were modelled as
following a bivariate Gaussian distribution. Cluster centres for the three diploid genotypes
were modelled jointly by a six-dimensional Gaussian distribution, with mean treated as a
hyperparameter and set empirically based on a training set of 156 normal samples. Cluster
centre and within-genotype covariance matrices were modelled as inverse Wishart, with
scale matrix hyperparameters also set empirically, and with degrees of freedom manually
tuned to provide satisfactory results for a wide range of probe behaviour and minor allele
frequencies. Finally, signal for SNP k (for the A and B alleles separately) was transformed
with a nonlinear function y=αkxγk + βk, with parameters selected on the basis of the
posterior distributions computed above.

Sample identity was verified using genotype concordance: pairs of tumours from the same
patient were expected to have >90% concordance, and all other pairs <80% concordance.
Samples failing these criteria were excluded. Quality of the overall HMM fit was assessed
by root mean squared (r.m.s.) error with respect to fitted values; samples with a r.m.s. error
of >1.5 were excluded. Finally, to account for two commonly observed artefacts, fitted copy
number values were set to‘NA’ for singletons with a fitted total copy number of 0, or when
the observed and fitted means differed by more than 2 for regions of inferred copy gain.
Recurrent DNA copy-number gain and loss
Genomic regions with recurrent DNA copy gain and loss were identified using GISTIC,
version 2.017. Probe integer total copy-number values obtained from PICNIC, c, were
converted to log2 ratio values, y, as y = log2(ctumour + 0.1) – log2(ccontrol + 0.1). These ratio
values were then segmented using CBS18. Cut-offs of +0.584 and −0.7 were used to
categorize log2 ratio values as gain or loss, respectively. A minimum segment length of 20
SNPs and a log2 ratio ‘cap’ value of 3 were used. The same CBS segmented data and

significant by GISTIC, which is reported in Supplementary Tables 13 and 14.

Fusion detection and validation
Putative fusions were identified using a computational pipeline we have developed called
GSTRUCT-fusions. Our pipeline is based on a generate-and-test strategy that is
fundamentally similar to our methodology reported previously for finding read-through
fusions37. Paired-end reads were aligned using our alignment program GSNAP37. GSNAP
has the ability to detect splices representing translocations, inversions and other distant
fusions within a single read end.
These distant splices provided one set of candidate fusions for the subsequent testing stage.
The other set of candidate fusions derived from unpaired unique alignments, in which each
end of the paired-end read aligned uniquely to a different chromosome, and also from
paired, but discordant unique alignments, in which each end aligned uniquely to the same
chromosome, but with an apparent genomic distance that exceeded 200,000 bp or with
genomic orientations that suggested an inversion or scrambling event.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Candidate fusions were then filtered against known transcripts from RefSeq and aligned to
the genome using GMAP38. We required that both fragments flanking a distant splice, or
both ends of an unpaired or discordant paired-end alignment, map to known exon regions.
This filtering step eliminated approximately 90% of the candidates. We further eliminated
candidate inversions and deletions that suggested rearrangements of the same gene, as well
as apparent read-through fusion events involving adjacent genesinthe genome, which our
previous research indicated were likely to have a transcriptional rather than a genomic
origin.
For the remaining candidate fusion events, we constructed artificial exon–exon junctions
consisting of the exons distal to the supported donor exon and the exons proximal to the
supported acceptor exon. The exons included in the proximal and distal computations were
limited so that the cumulative length along each gene was within an estimated maximum
insert length of 200 bp. As a control, we also constructed all exon–exon junctions consisting
of combinations of exons within the same gene, for all genes contributing to a candidate
fusion event.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the testing stage of our pipeline, we constructed a genomic index from the artificial exon–
exon junctions and controls using the GMAP_BUILD program included as part of the
GMAP and GSNAP package. We used this genomic index and the GSNAP program with
splice detection turned off to re-align the original read ends that were not concordant to the
genome. We extracted reads that aligned to an intergenic junction corresponding to a
candidate fusion, but not to a control intragenic junction.
We filtered the results of the re-alignment to require that each candidate fusion have at least
one read with an overhang of 20 bp. We also required that each candidate fusion have at
least ten supporting reads. For each remaining candidate fusion, we aligned the two
component genes against each other using GMAP and eliminated the fusion if the alignment
had any region containing 60 matches in a window of 75 bp. We also aligned the exon–exon
junction against each of the component genes using GMAP and eliminated the fusion if the
alignment had coverage greater than 90% of the junction and identity greater than 95%.
Validation of gene fusions was done using an RT–PCR approach using both colon tumour
and matched normal samples. 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed to
complementary DNA with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life

Technologies) following manufacturer's instructions. 50 ng of cDNA was amplified in a 25
μl reaction containing 400 pM of each primer, 300 μM of each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate and 2.5 U of LongAmp Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR
was performed with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C
for 10s, 56 °C for 1 min and 68 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 68 °C for 10min. 3
μl of PCR product was run on 1.2% agarose gel to identify samples containing the gene
fusion. Specific PCR products were purified with either a QIAquick PCR Purification
kitorGel Extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA was either sequenced directly with PCR
primers specific to each fusion (Supplementary Table 14) or cloned into TOPO cloning
vector pCR2.1 (Life Technologies) before Sanger sequencing. The clones were sequenced
using Sanger sequencing on an ABI 3730 XL (Life Technologies) as per manufacturer's
instructions. The Sanger sequencing trace files were analysed using Sequencher (Gene
Codes Corp.).
RSPO fusion activity testing
A eukaryotic expression plasmid pRK5E driving the expression of carboxy-terminal Flagtagged EIF3E, PTPKR (amino acids 1–387), RSPO2, RSPO3, EIF3E(e1)–RSPO2(e2),
PTPRK(e1)–RSPO3(e2) and PTPRK(e7)–RSPO3(e2) was generated using standard PCR
and cloning strategies.

Cells, conditioned media, immunoprecipitation and western blotting
HEK293T and HT-29 cells were obtained from Genentech's cell banking facility. HEK 293T
cells were maintained in DMEM buffer supplemented with 10% FBS. HT-29 cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. For expression analysis and
condition media generation 3 × 105 HEK29T3 cells were plated in six-well plates in 1.5 ml
DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with 1 mg DNA using Fugene 6
(Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. Media was conditioned for 48 h, collected,
centrifuged and used to stimulate the luciferase reporter assay (final concentration, ×0.1–
0.4). For expression analysis, media was collected, centrifuged to remove debris and used
for immunoprecipitation.
Luciferase reporter assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HEK293T (50,000cells perml) or HT-29cells (110,000 cells per ml) were plated in 90 μl of
media containing 2.5% FBS per well of a 96-well plate. After 24 h, cells were transfected
using Fugene 6 according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche) with the following DNA
per well: 0.04 μg (HEK293T) or 0.08 μg (HT-29) TOPbrite Firefly reporter25 and 0.02μg
(HEK293T) and 0.04 μg (HT-29) pRL-SV40 Renilla (Promega) constructs. Cells were
stimulated with 25 μl of either fresh or conditioned media (described above) containing 10%
FBS with or without recombinant murine Wnt3a (20–100 ng per ml (final), R&D Systems).
After 24 h stimulation, 50 μl of media was removed and replaced with Dual-Glo luciferase
detection reagents (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. An Envision
Luminometer (Perkin–Elmer) was used to detect luminescence. To control for transfection
efficiency, firefly luciferase levels were normalized to Renilla luciferase levels to generate
the measure of relative luciferase units. Experimental data are presented as mean ± s.d. from
three independent wells.
Immunoprecipitation and western blotting
To confirm that the RSPO wild-type and RSPO fusion proteins were secreted, Flag-tagged
proteins were immunoprecipitated from the media using anti-Flag–M2 antibody-coupled
beads (Sigma), boiled in SDS–PAGE loading buffer, resolved on 4–20% SDS–PAGE
(Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. RSPO and other Flag-tagged

proteins expressed in cells were detected from cell lysates using western blot as described
previously. In brief, immunoprecipitated proteins and proteins from cell lysates were
detected by western blot using Flag–horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and Super
signal West Dura chemiluminescence detection substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Transposon-based genetic screen
In brief, a cohort of triple-transgenic mice (Rosa26–LsL–Sb11, T2/Onc, Villin–Cre) were
generated to allow tissue-restricted mobilization of a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon
in the gastrointestinal epithelium6. Triple-transgenic mice developed intestinal
intraepithelial neoplasias, adenomas and adenocarcinomas. In total, 135 tumours from 47
mice were analysed for transposon-insertion sites by DNA extraction, linker-mediated PCR
to amplify genomic DNA-transposon junctions, and 454 pyrosequencing. 16,000 nonredundant transposon insertion sites were mapped, and a Monte Carlo method was used to
define common insertion sites (CISs) that were recurrently targeted by transposon insertions
at a higher frequency than predicted by chance.
