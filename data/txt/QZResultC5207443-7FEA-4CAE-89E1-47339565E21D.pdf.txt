ABSTRACT:
Somatic mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are frequent in
low grade and progressive gliomas and are characterized by the production of
2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from α-ketoglutarate by the mutant enzyme. 2-HG is an
“oncometabolite” that competitively inhibits α-KG dependent dioxygenases resulting
in various widespread cellular changes including abnormal hypermethylation of
genomic DNA and suppression of cellular differentiation. Despite the growing
understanding of IDH mutant gliomas, the development of effective therapies has
proved challenging in part due to the scarcity of endogenous mutant in vivo models.
Here we report the generation of an endogenous IDH1 anaplastic astrocytoma model
which rapidly grows in vivo, produces 2-HG and exhibits DNA hypermethylation. Using
this model, we have demonstrated the preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action of
the FDA approved demethylating drug 5-azacytidine in vivo. Long term administration
of 5-azacytidine resulted in reduction of DNA methylation of promoter loci, induction
of glial differentiation, reduction of cell proliferation and a significant reduction in
tumor growth. Tumor regression was observed at 14 weeks and subsequently showed
no signs of re-growth at 7 weeks despite discontinuation of therapy. These results
have implications for clinical trials of demethylating agents for patients with IDH
mutated gliomas.

INTRODUCTION

in the catalytic domain of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1
(IDH1) of progressive gliomas and targeted sequencing
found additional mutations in the mitochondrial family
member IDH2 [1, 2]. Remarkably, more than 70% of
grade II-III gliomas and secondary GBMs were found
to bear mutations in IDH1 or IDH2. Both the IDH1 and
IDH2 mutations were highly conserved, confined to a
single residue, R132 and R172, respectively, and most
frequently a single allele was mutated with the wild type
allele retained [1]. Since its identification as an oncogene
in glioma, IDH mutations have been identified in a
number of cancer types, including a large percentage of

Gliomas are a classification of nervous system
tumors arising from glial cells, the most common of which
are astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, arising from
astrocytes and oligodendroglia, respectively. The most
aggressive glioma is the WHO grade IV astrocytoma, or
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which can arise de novo
(primary GBM) or can progress from a WHO grade II or
III glioma (secondary or progressive GBM).

[3, 4] as well as a small percentage of prostate cancer
[5], cholangiocarcinoma [6, 7], and chondrosarcoma [8].
Overall evidence suggests that gain-of-function IDH1 or
IDH2 mutations affect one or several fundamental cellular
processes that underlie several types of malignancies.
Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed the
probable mechanism of this oncogene: IDH mutations
alter the enzymatic function of the protein to produce
D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from α-ketoglutarate (αKG)[9]. Normally not present in human cells at significant
concentrations, 2-HG functions as an “oncometabolite”
that competitively inhibits several α-KG dependent
dioxygenases [10]. Of particular importance, 2-HG
has been shown to inhibit both the TET family of
5-methylcytosine hydroxylases and the H3K9 demethylase
KDM4C, leading to the accumulation of repressive histone
and DNA methylation alterations and a subsequent
transcriptional block of differentiation gene expression
[11, 12]. It has recently been shown that IDH mutations
alone are sufficient to induce a global hypermethylated
phenotype that is characteristic of the gliomas with these
mutations [12, 13].
Abnormal DNA hypermethylation has been
recognized as a possible target in cancer and DNA
methylation reducing drugs, including 5-azacytidine that
was reported nearly 40 years ago [14]. 5-azacytidine is
an analogue of cytidine and it is incorporated into DNA
and RNA. At therapeutic doses, 5-azacytidine inhibits
DNA methyltransferase leading to a reduction in DNA
methylation. In particular, 5-azacytidine is a potent
inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), inducing
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the protein [15].
Unfortunately, despite the growing understanding
of IDH mutant gliomas, the development of effective
therapies has proved challenging. IDH mutant tumors do
not adapt well to growth in culture, including ‘stem cell’
media and endogenous mutant models remain scarce [16,
17]. Engineered cell lines have been useful in elucidating
the complex network underlying IDH mutations but lack
the appropriate genetic and mutational context found in
patient derived IDH mutant gliomas. Patient derived
endogenous IDH mutant models are therefore critical for
the development and testing of therapies which target IDH
driven oncogenenic pathways and mechanisms.
Here we report the generation of an endogenous
IDH1 anaplastic astrocytoma and the preclinical
demonstration of efficacy and mechanism of 5-azacytidine
in this model. Long term administration of 5-azacytidine
resulted in inhibition of DNMT1, loss of methylation of
key genomic markers, in vivo induction of differentiation,
reduction of cell proliferation and a significantly reduced
tumor growth. Tumor growth was essentially arrested at
14 weeks and subsequently showed no signs yet of regrowth after removal of the therapy.

Establishment and serial passage of an IDH1
(R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma model
Tumor was obtained from the resection of an
anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) from an adult
patient with a history of glioma who presented with a
large right temporal lobe tumor. The patient had been
previously diagnosed with a low grade astrocytoma
(WHO grade II) after his initial craniotomy twelve years
prior. The resected WHO grade III tumor was found
to have a high degree of anaplasia but lacked areas of
necrosis and vascular proliferation. Direct sequencing
of IDH1 exon 4 demonstrated that the grade III tumor
bore a heterozygous G395A (R132H) mutation (Figure
1C), validated by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1B).
Fresh tissue was collected from the specimen and directly
implanted subcutaneously into athymic nude mice.
Additionally, neurosphere cultures from the same patient
were attempted in multiple media conditions including
serum-free media containing hFGF and hEGF, but these
cells did not propagate. However, a first generation tumor
quickly arose in the nude mouse approximately one month
after implantation as a large, localized subcutaneous mass.
The resulting IDH1 (R132H) tumor model was designated
as JHH-273. Direct sequencing of the xenograft tissue
revealed preservation of the IDH1 (G395A) mutation,
but revealed a loss of the wild type copy (Figure 1C).
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong IDH1
(R132H) expression throughout the tissue (Figure 1B). All
subsequent serial passages have retained the hemizygous
IDH1 (R132H) mutation and exhibit robust expression of
the mutant protein.

Xenografts show histopathological similarity and
diffuse growth pattern
Histopathological analysis of H&E samples
obtained from the patient’s recurrent tumor sample and
subsequently xenograft tissue showed that both the flank
and orthotopic xenografts maintain histopathological
similarity to the patient tumor and maintain morphological
characteristics of anaplastic astrocytomas (Figure 1A).
The patient’s recurrent tumor was a cellular infiltrating
astrocytoma with scattered gemistocytic cells as well
as rare tumor giant cells. Scattered mitotic figures were
identified consistent with the diagnosis of an anaplastic
astrocytoma. Immunostaining for mutant IDH1 was
strongly and diffusely positive. JHH-273 xenografts
maintained many of the features of the primary tumor
including a typical astrocytic morphology as well as
scattered tumor giant cells, mixed with vascular, stromal,
and skeletal muscle elements characteristic of this

(Figure 2B). In contrast, 2-HG was nearly undetectable

Recent data has shown that one consequence of IDH
mutation is the induction of global DNA hypermethylation
which is believed to contribute to tumor formation
and maintenance [12, 21, 22]. In order to determine
the methylation status of JHH-273, we performed
pyrosequencing analysis of bisulfate-converted genomic
DNA at five genetic loci. Targets were selected based
on the reported frequency of hypermethylation in IDH1
(R132H) primary tissue and engineered cell systems as
well as their known functional impact in tumoriogenesis or
tumor maintenance [21-31]. The analysis was performed
using genomic DNA obtained from both early and late
passage xenograft tissue (passages 1, 7 and 10) as well
as two unrelated IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma

The JHH-273 model grows rapidly in the flank
(Figure 2A). Serially transplantable flank xenografts reach
maximum size (2.0 cm3) approximately 7 weeks after
implantation and grow as dense, localized, hypercellular
masses.
Production of 2-HG from α-KG is a hallmark of IDH
mutations and its accumulation is believed to underlie the
pathogenesis of IDH mutations. Therefore, we investigated
whether our patient-derived model produces 2-HG. LC/
MS analysis was performed on snap frozen tissue from
well-established flank xenograft (passage 7). JHH-273
produced high levels of 2-HG which correspond to the
endogenous levels reported in IDH1/2 mutant gliomas

samples and three IDH1 (WT) glioma primary patient
samples as controls. The original patient tumor exhibited
high degrees of CpG methylation at three of the five loci
(the RBP1 locus did not amplify), which was maintained
in the xenograft tissue at all passages analyzed (Figure
3A). The high levels of CpG methylation were consistent
with other primary patient IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic
astrocytoma samples. In contrast, wild type IDH1 gliomas
exhibited low levels of methylation at all targets analyzed,
consistent with reported data. Of note, although SOX9
hypermethylation in IDH mutant gliomas has been
reported in several studies, we did not detect significant
methylation in either primary tissue sample or xenograft.
Overall, JHH-273 reflects the hypermethylated genomic
landscape of the original patient tumor and characteristic
of an IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma.
To determine whether hypomethylating agent
5-azacytidine is able to reverse methylation of the JHH273 tumors in vivo, we analyzed CpG methylation of
flank tumors following treatment with one cycle of
5-azacytidine (1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg). 5-azacytidine was
able to reduce CpG hypermethylation at four of the five
targets analyzed in a dose specific manner (Figure 3B).
Although a significant tumor regression was observed in
the high dose treatment group, this was accompanied with
significant toxicity (data not shown).

To extend the relative exposure time of JHH-273
tumor to 5-azacytidine, serial passage of flank tumors from
treated mice was performed using the strategy outlined
in Figure 4. A moderate reduction of tumor burden was
observed within one treatment cycle, but this decrease was
not significant (p=0.27) (Figure 5A). Following passage
of 5-azacytidine treated flank tumors, a second cycle of
treatment with the 5-azacytidine was resumed as before
and continued until maximum tumor burden was reached.
5-azacytidine significantly reduced tumor burden by
the fourth week of Cycle 2 (p<0.01), and the difference
between untreated and treated increased throughout the
treatment period (Figure 5B). During passage of tumor
after Cycle 2, the tissue was found to be unusually firm
and encapsulated by gelatinous tissue. Enzymatically
disassociated fractions of the tumor were found to be
less than 10% viable by Trypan blue exclusion (data not
shown).
5-azacytidine serially treated tumors were implanted
for a third time into two groups of athymic nude mice
(Cycle 3). To assess the durability of the therapeutic
response, treatment was withdrawn in one group.
Significant tumor regression was observed in both groups,

shows that the original patient tumor exhibits high levels of

performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue.
Compared with untreated tissue, 5-azacytidine treatment
markedly increased the fraction of GFAP-positive cells
(Figure 6C). These results confirm that IDH mutations
plays an active role in repressing cellular differentiation,
a deficiency which is reversible with long term treatment
with hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine.
To test whether 5-azacytidine induced differentiation
translated to a decrease in proliferation, tumors from
5-azacytidine treated mice were stained with the
proliferation marker Ki-67. 5-azacytidine treatment
significantly reduced the fraction of Ki-67 positive cells
in a time dependent manner, with the greatest decrease
in proliferation during the 7 to 14 week period of Cycle
2 (Figure 6D).

Treatment
with
5-azacytidine
induces
differentiation and reduces the proliferative index
Intracellular 5-azacytidine activity was confirmed
by DNMT1 expression in tissue from untreated and
5-azacytidine treated tumors (Cycles 1 and 2). DNMT1 is
expressed at high levels in untreated tumors but expression
of the protein is robustly inhibited following treatment
with 5-azacytidine. DNMT1 protein was undetectable
after one treatment cycle of 5-azacytidine (Figure 6A).
Prior studies had proposed that the IDH mutation
inhibits DNA and histone demethylation leading to a
block in cellular differentiation [24]. Additionally in a
study published in this issue, treatment of endogenous
IDH1 mutant glioma cell lines with hypomethylating
agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine was found to drive
differentiation in vitro [32]. To test whether reduction of
hypermethylation by 5-azacytidine leads to an increase
in cellular differentiation in vivo, immunoblotting was
performed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in
tumors treated with 5-azacytidine. GFAP expression
was undetectable in the untreated tumors, confirming
the undifferentiated phenotype of IDH (R132H) tumors.
Following one cycle of 5-azacytidine treatment, GFAP
expression was robustly increased and protein levels were
maintained throughout the second treatment cycle. To
validate these findings, immunohistochemical analysis was

JHH-273. This model was established after many
attempts, which underscores the difficulty most labs have
had at growing IDH mutant astrocytomas. The goal of
establishing the xenografts was to enhance translational
studies with more accurate models harboring relevant
mutations that developed during the course of human
tumorigenesis. Importantly, we show in that IDH1
(R132H) expression is stable through multiple passages,
2-HG is robustly produced in the tissue, and the model
bears a hypermethylated CpG phenotype characteristic of
IDH1 mutant glioma.
Once evidence emerged that hypermethylation
was a likely oncogenic mechanism of IDH mutations,
demethylating agents became an attractive choice for
translational investigation. When 5-azacytidine treatment
was first tested in the JHH-273 model, a decrease in
methylation was observed in a dose specific manner but
was associated with only marginal reduction of tumor
burden. We were able to achieve a significant in vivo
response by lowering drug dosing and extending the
relative exposure time of tumor to drug by passaging pre-

percentage of low grade and progressive gliomas. IDH
mutant gliomas are associated with a pro-neural gene
expression profile, a characteristic pattern of DNA
hypermethylation and a signature of repressive histone
methylation [12]. A mechanism by which the 2-HG
produced by IDH mutations are believed to promote
tumorigenesis is by blocking cellular differentiation via
hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes involved in
differentiation [11-13, 21, 22].
The current therapy for low grade gliomas is surgical
resection followed by monitoring with periodic MRI
scans. Unfortunately, the majority of these tumors recur or
progress to a high grade glioma. Although repeat surgery
and additional treatment with radiation can temporarily
slow tumor growth, if the gliomas progress to high grade
no curative therapy is available. Median survival for
grade II astrocytoma (fibrillary or diffuse astrocytoma) is
approximately 5 to 7 years and for grade III astrocytoma
(anaplastic), median survival is 4 to 5 years [33].
In this work, we report the first in vivo model of
a patient derived IDH mutant anaplastic astrocytoma,

treated tumor tissue into treatment naïve mice.
Short term 5-azacytidine treatment (1 cycle, 7
weeks) perhaps started to slow tumor growth, but by
doubling treatment time, we were able to achieve tumor
regression. Treatment with 5-azacytidine for 2 cycles
elicited a durable treatment response as treatment
withdrawal for an additional 6 weeks did not produce any
visible signs of tumor re-growth (although we continue
to monitor the mice). At the end of 2 treatment cycles,
the tumors had changed dramatically in appearance with
the presence of hard fibrous tissue and less than 10%
cell viability. Additionally, with 7 weeks of treatment
5-azacytidine drives cellular differentiation to the
astrocytic linage as seen by increase in GFAP expression,
further underscoring the reversal of the presumed
mechanism of mutant IDH1 oncogenesis. These data
are consistent with the hypothesis that demethylating
drugs may promote re-expression of previously silenced
Polycomb controlled genes and subsequently activate
genes involved in differentiation [21, 34].
The observed induction of cellular differentiation
and subsequent reduction in proliferation following
treatment with a hypomethylating agent in IDH mutant
glioma is surprisingly consistent with an independent
study that is simultaneously reported in this journal [32].
In this companion work, decitabine, a closely related
demethylating agent, was found to preferentially induce
differentiation in IDH mutant glioma cells but not in wild
type cells. This work showed very similar mechanistic
results to this study, and since both the drug and the models
utilized are independent, the collective evidence supports
the hypothesis that the gene expression reactivated by
demethylating agents is sufficient to produce terminal
differentiation in the self renewing malignant cells of the
tumor.
5-azacytidine is currently FDA approved for the
treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and well tolerated
in patients. Its close structural analogue, decitabine, can
effectively cross the blood brain barrier in laboratory
animals [35]. Experimentally, pre-treatment of cells with
transient, low dose exposure of 5-azacytidine has been
shown to decrease tumorigenicity and percentage of
stem-like cells in several cancer models [36]. In addition
to considering 5-azacytidine or decitabine for recurrent
or high grade IDH mutant glioma, 5-azacytidine therapy
may also be useful as a maintenance therapy following
tumor resection. Due to the infiltrative growth pattern of
astrocytoma, complete resection is nearly impossible and
the remaining tumor frequently recurs, often as a higher
grade glioma. Low-dose treatment with 5-azacytidine
following resection may drive the remaining mutant
IDH glioma cells into differentiation, thereby delaying
recurrence.
This work supports the further investigation of
demethylating drugs such as 5-azacytidine for its use
against mutant IDH gliomas both in the laboratory and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in clinical trials. Although it is very likely that these
drugs have the potential to help patients with IDH1
mutant gliomas, the optimal demethylating drug,
patient population, dosing strategy, delivery and drug
combinations have yet to be determined.

METHODS
Flank xenograft establishment and passage
A fresh tissue sample was obtained during the
resection of an anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade
III) from a male patient. The tissue was implanted
subcutaneously into a 4–6-week old female athymic nude
mice (NCI-Frederick) under a Johns Hopkins approved
protocol as previously described [18]. Briefly, the freshly
harvested tumor tissue was mechanically dissociated
using scalpels, mixed with an equal volume of growth
factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, CA), and
injected subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic nude
mice (0.2cc/flank). Xenografts were passaged in a similar
fashion and animals were monitored frequently for signs of
tumor growth. All animal protocols and procedures were
performed in accordance with the Johns Hopkins Animal
Care and Use Committee guidelines. Orthotopic tumors
were established using cells obtained from flank tissue
disassociated using a 2:1 ratio of collagenase (10mg/mL,
Invitrogen, NY) and hyaluronidase (1000 units/mL, Sigma
Aldrich, MO). Cross-sectional samples were obtained at
each passage and fixed in formalin. The samples were
then embedded in paraffin and stained by H&E or used
for immunohistochemistry. The IDH1 (R132H) mutation
was validated by direct sequencing for each passage.

Sequencing of IDH1
Genomic DNA was isolated from patient tissue
and flank xenografts using the DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. PCR and sequencing was conducted as
previously described [19]. Briefly, 60 ng of genomic
DNA was added to a standard PCR reaction to amplify
a portion of exon 4 of IDH1 (forward5’-GTAAAACGA
CGGCCAGTTGAGCTCTATATGCCATCACTGC 3’,
reverse 5’-CAATTTCATACCTTGCTTAATGGG-3’).
The PCR product was purified using the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, CA) and submitted for
sequencing (Genewiz, NJ) using targeted primers (forward
5’-CGGTCTTCAGAGAAGCCATT-3’, and reverse
5’-GCAAAATCACATTATTGCCAAC-3’).

Pyrosequencing of target genes

2-hydroxyglutarate levels were analyzed from
snap frozen flank xenograft samples. Prior to extraction,
frozen samples were thawed in a water bath at ambient
temperature. Tissue homogenates were prepared at a
concentration of 200 mg/mL in methanol. A 10 µL aliquot
of homogenized tissue was added to a borosilicate glass
test tube (13x100 mm) containing 10 µL of acetonitrile
solution and 2-phosphonomethyl pentanedioic acid (1
mg/mL), which was used as the internal standard. The
tube was mixed vigorously and evaporated under nitrogen
gas at 4°C until completely dried. After the samples
were dried, 100 µl of acetonitrile and 100 µL of N-tertButyldimethysilyl-N-methyltrifluoro-acetamide
were
added sequentially. The tubes were incubated at 80°C
for 1 hour then diluted 1:10 with acetonitrile. 100 µl of
the top layer was transferred to a 250-µL polypropylene
autosampler vial sealed with a Teflon crimp cap. 10 µL
of each sample was injected onto the LC/MS/MS for
quantitative analysis using a temperature-controlled
autosampling device operating at 10°C. Chromatographic
analysis was performed using an ACQuity TM UItra
Performance LC (Waters, MA). Separation of the analyte
from potentially interfering material was achieved at
ambient temperature using X-Terra® RP18 column (20 x
2.1 mm, Waters, MA) packed with a 3.5 µm RP18 material
(Milford, MA). The mobile phase used for the
chromatographic separation was composed of acetonitrile
with 0.1% formic acid and 2mM ammonium acetate in
water (80:20, v/v) and delivered using an isocratic flow
rate of 0.3 mL/minute. The column effluent was monitored
using a QTRAP R 5500 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX,
MA). The instrument was equipped with an electrospray
interface, operated in a positive mode and controlled by
the Analyst 1.5.1 software. The mass spectrometry was
programmed to monitor the following MRM’s 491.0 to
359 for 2HG and 683.0 to 551.4 for the IS. Samples were
quantified over the assay range of 0.02 to 2 µg/mL. The
standard curve of ratio response (analyte peak area/IS peak
area) vs. concentration was plotted using linear regression
with 1/x weighting for the data analyzed.

Bisulfite conversion was carried out using EpiTect
Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, CA) with 1μg genomic DNA. PCR
was carried out using PyroMark PCR kit (Qiagen, CA)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples
were run in a 25 µL reaction with 2.5 µL of primer
reconstituted according to manufacturer’s instructions.
The thermocycler conditions are an initial activation step
of 95ºC for 15 minutes, 45 cycles of 94ºC for 30 seconds,
56ºC for 30 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds, and a final
extension of 72ºC for 10 minutes. Controls included 100%,
50%, and 0% human methylated control DNA (Zymo
Research Corp, CA), and a no-template control. Samples
plus controls were amplified using primer kits Hs_
PYCARD_03_PM, Hs_RBP1_02_PM, Hs_MGMT_01_
PM, Hs_SOX9_08_PM, and Hs_BMP4_02_PM (Qiagen,
CA). Amplified DNA was then pyrosequenced using the
PyroMark CpG Assay kit (Qiagen, CA) on the PyroMark
24 system (Qiagen, CA). Bisulfite conversion, PCR
amplification and pyrosequencing was performed at the
Genetic Resources Core Facility, Johns Hopkins Institute
of Genetic Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

Therapeutic administration of 5-azacytidine to

above. Five days after implantation, mice received daily
i.p. injections of 5-azacytidine (Sigma Aldrich, MO; 3 mg/
kg) diluted in sterile water for five days followed by a two
day rest period. Treatment continued until tumors reached
maximum allowable size (Cycle 1). Following sacrifice,
tumors were harvested and passaged individually into
another set of female athymic nude mice, identically as
before. 5-azacytidine treatment was resumed immediately
after tumor implantation and continued until tumors
reached maximum allowable size (Cycle 2). Following the
second cycle of treatment, tumors were again resected and
passaged into two groups of mice. To assess the durability
of the therapeutic response, 5-azacytidine treatment
was withdrawn in one group of pre-treated animals and
resumed immediately in the other (Cycle 3). Treatment
strategy is outlined in Figure 4. Tumors were measured
weekly and volume was calculated as: H×L×W (mm3).

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded (5 micron) sections were
deparaffinized, and stained with either hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) or immunohistochemical stains
as specified. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was
performed for 36 minutes at 98°C in target retrieval
buffer. Immunohistochemical staining was performed
using antibodies specific for IDH1 (R132H) (Dianova,
DIAH09LM), GFAP (Dako, Z0334) and Ki-67 (Ventana,
790-4286). Immunostaining was visualized using the
ultraView DAB detection system (Ventana Medical

Immunoblotting
Protein lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
and immunoblot analysis was performed as previously
described [20]. Briefly, protein lysates were obtained

from freshly resected flank tumors using RIPA buffer
(ThermoScientific, MA) containing Halt protease inhibitor
cocktails (Pierce, IL) according to the recommendations
of the manufacturer. Lysates (50 μg) were heated to 95°C
in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min and separated on
SDS polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in Western
transfer buffer [25 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mmol/L
glycine, and 20% methanol]. For Western blot analysis,
membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in
5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20)
and incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies against
GFAP (Cell Signaling Technology, MA), or DNMT1
(New England Biolabs, MA). After washing, membranes
were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat
anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody
detection was achieved by chemiluminescence according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Pierce, IL).
