ABSTRACT
Recent studies have shown that dysfunctional microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved
in the progression of various cancers. Dysfunctional miRNAs may jointly regulate
their target genes and further alter the activities of canonical biological pathways.
Identification of the pathways regulated by a group of dysfunctional miRNAs could
help uncover the pathogenic mechanisms of cancer and facilitate development of new
drug targets. Current miRNA-pathway analyses mainly use differentially-expressed
miRNAs to predict the shared pathways on which they act. However, these methods
fail to consider the level of differential expression level, which could improve our
understanding of miRNA function. We propose a novel computational method,
MicroRNA Set Enrichment Analysis (MiRSEA), to identify the pathways regulated by
dysfunctional miRNAs. MiRSEA integrates the differential expression levels of miRNAs
with the strength of miRNA pathway associations to perform direct enrichment analysis
using miRNA expression data. We describe the MiRSEA methodology and illustrate
its effectiveness through analysis of data from hepatocellular cancer, gastric cancer
and lung cancer. With these analyses, we show that MiRSEA can successfully detect
latent biological pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs. We have implemented
MiRSEA as a freely available R-based package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/
web/packages/MiRSEA/).

INTRODUCTION

between states of health and disease, and maps their target
genes to biological pathways for enrichment analysis [5].
However, it has been demonstrated that this method
usually identifies similar biological pathways even if the
phenotypes of interest are very different [6, 7]. Thus, this
method may be biased and lead to inaccurate results.
To more accurately identify pathways regulated
by dysfunctional miRNAs, several studies integrated
matched miRNA and gene expression data. Nam et al.
developed a method, MicroRNA and MRNA Integrated
Analysis (MMIA), which integrates miRNA and mRNA
expression data with miRNA target information to identify
the pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNA sets [8].
MMIA identifies significantly dysfunctional miRNAs from
miRNA expression data as well as significantly inversely
correlated mRNAs of dysfunctional miRNAs from mRNA

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA
molecules that are correlated with regulation of cell
homeostasis and various biological processes such as DNA
replication, cell development, cell cycle and cell apoptosis
[1]. Recent studies have shown that dysfunctional
miRNAs are involved in the initiation and progression of
various complex diseases, especially cancers, and these
dysfunctional miRNAs always participate in regulating
several biological pathways [1, 2]. Thus, identifying
biological pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs
could help us understand disease classification, diagnosis
and prognosis [3, 4]. To discover the pathways regulated
by a group of dysfunctional miRNAs, the most widely
used method compares differentially-expressed miRNAs

expression data. Pathway enrichment analysis is performed
for the intersection of predicted target mRNAs and the
inversely correlated mRNAs. Xin et al. applied a similar
strategy in their work and identified biological pathways
regulated by down-regulated and up-regulated miRNAs in
MCF7-FR cells [9]. Nevertheless, these methods require
matched miRNA and gene expression data sets, which
limit their application. Using only miRNA expression
profiles to assess the role of miRNAs in regulating
biological pathways would greatly expand the utility of
the analysis.
Godard et al. proposed an improved method to
identify the pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs
through enrichment analysis of converted miRNA
pathways [7]. In this method, they mapped miRNAs to
their pathways according to miRNA-target interactions, and
thus pathways of protein-coding genes were converted into
lists of miRNAs. A hypergeometric test was then performed
by comparing the lists of differentially-expressed miRNAs
to the lists of miRNAs in the converted pathways. This
method obtains results specific to miRNA signatures, but it
treats all differentially-expressed miRNAs equally and fails
to consider the effect of miRNA differential expression
levels. Similar to genes, prioritizing miRNAs according
to their differential expression levels may provide more
detailed and comprehensive biological insights. However,
this method maps miRNAs to a pathway if only one of
their target genes is located in the pathway, and does not
consider the total number of genes in the pathways they
target.
In the current study, we developed a novel method,
MicroRNA Set Enrichment Analysis (MiRSEA), to
identify the pathways regulated by a group of dysfunctional
miRNAs. MiRSEA integrates the differential expression
levels of miRNAs with the strength of miRNA pathway
associations, then performs direct enrichment analysis
using miRNA expression data. We initially used the
hypergeometric test to calculate the weights of miRNAs
associated with pathways using miRNA-target interaction
information from four public databases (miRTarBase [10],
TarBase [11], miRecords [12] and mir2Disease [13]). In
this way, pathways of protein-coding genes were converted
into pathways of miRNAs according to miRNA-pathway
weights. We then evaluated the differential expression
levels of miRNAs between two phenotypes of interest.
For each converted miRNA pathway, we integrated the
differential expression levels of miRNAs and miRNApathway weights, and used the weighted Kolmogorov–
Smirnov statistic to calculate a pathway enrichment
score. Finally, the permutation test was implemented to
estimate the statistical significance of enrichment scores.
We applied the MiRSEA method to hepatocellular cancer,
gastric cancer and lung cancer datasets, and compared our
results with two other miRNA-pathway analysis methods.
Based on these analyses, we validated that MiRSEA is

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

able to identify the biological pathways regulated by
dysfunctional miRNAs in the development of diseases.

RESULTS
MiRSEA was developed to identify the pathways
regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs through direct
enrichment analysis of miRNAs in converted pathways.
A workflow diagram of the MiRSEA methodology is
shown in Figure 1. In the study, we first demonstrated the
ability of MiRSEA to provide biologically meaningful
insights using three real miRNA expression datasets from
hepatocellular cancer, gastric cancer and lung cancer.
In each case, we searched for significant biological
pathways regulated by a dysfunctional miRNA set. We
then tested if MiRSEA could consistently obtain these
results by applying MiRSEA to two independent lung
cancer datasets. Finally, we compared the results of
MiRSEA with two other pathway enrichment analyses
of miRNAs.

Analyses of hepatocellular carcinoma data
The first case we chose to evaluate the effectiveness
of MiRSEA was human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
data published by Shih et al. [14]. This dataset contains
miRNA expression profiles of 21 non-tumor liver tissues
and 68 HCC samples. We applied MiRSEA to identify
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs in the
HCC data. All the pathways were prioritized using FDR
(Supplementary Table S1).
Using FDR < 0.01 pathway significance threshold,
the Normal > HCC analysis identified 22 pathways
enriched in down-regulated miRNAs in the HCC samples
(Table 1). Most of the pathways were readily interpreted in
terms of current knowledge of HCC. The most significant
pathway was the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, which
was proposed to be correlated with tumor cell migration
and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma [15]. We took
this pathway as an example to interpret the rationale of
the MiRSEA method. Specifically, we first converted
pathways of protein-coding genes into pathways of
miRNAs with weights, and the weight reflects the strength
to which miRNAs regulate pathways. We then defined a
miRScore to integrate the differential expression level of
the miRNA and the miRNA-pathway weight. A ranked
miRNA list was constructed according to decreasing
miRScore. The miRNAs in the converted pathway were
mapped to the ranked miRNA list, and a running-sum
statistic was calculated by increasing the statistic when
we encountered a miRNA in the converted pathway and
decreasing it when we encountered miRNAs not in the
converted pathway (Figure 2A). The maximum deviation
from zero of the statistic was used as the miRNA

enrichment score (miRES) of the pathway. In a converted
miRNA pathway, only a subset of miRNAs in the pathway
contributes to the miRES, and these miRNAs will typically
participate in a biological process. We thus defined the
core miRNAs in a pathway to be those miRNAs appearing
in the ranked miRNA list L at and before the point where
miRES(P) is obtained (or after if miRES(P) < 0). Five core
miRNAs were identified in HCC data (Supplementary

miR-375 and miR-769-5p. Compared to normal samples,
we found these miRNAs were down-regulated in HCC

miRNAs, in particular, miR-1, miR-125b and miR-375,
has been proposed to be correlated with growth of HCC
cells [16–18]. The down-regulation of these miRNAs
may result in up-regulation of their targets. By mapping
the targets of these miRNAs to the original sphingolipid
metabolism pathway, we found that a high number of
genes in the pathway were targeted (Figure 2C). This may
alter the properties of sphingolipid metabolism in HCC
and contribute to cancer progression [19].
The complementary analysis (HCC>Normal)
identified 11 statistically significant pathways enriched by
up-regulated miRNAs in HCC with FDR<0.01 (Table 1).

Almost all are clearly demonstrated to be associated
with HCC. These pathways include the chemokine
signaling pathway, which plays a paramount role in HCC
progression, growth and metastasis and immune response
to HCC [20, 21]; genes encoding proteins in the tight

junction pathway that are associated with recurrence of
primary HCC [22]; and kinases in the phosphatidylinositol
signaling pathway that mediate acquired resistance to
sorafenib (a drug approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration for HCC) in HCC cells [23].

Specifically, in the chemokine signaling pathway, 25 core
miRNAs were identified (Supplementary Figure S1A and
Supplementary Table S3) and their expression was upregulated in HCC (Supplementary Figure S1B). They
include miR-96, miR-221, miR-182 and miR-135a,
which may be associated with initiation and progression
of HCC. For instance, miR-96 was frequently found to be
up-regulated in HCC [24]. Overexpression of miR-221
stimulated growth of tumorigenic murine hepatic progenitor
cells, and the use of synthetic inhibitors of miR-221
was shown to be a promising approach in liver cancer
treatment [25]. Wang et al. found that miR-182 was
up-regulated in a rat model of HCC and could act as an HCC
oncogene [26]. Moreover, miR-135a promoted invasion and
metastasis in vitro and in mouse models of HCC [27]. The
accumulation of these core miRNAs may jointly alter the
activity of chemokine signaling pathway in HCC.

matrix metalloproteinase-9, ras homolog family member
A and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, have been
demonstrated to be associated with tumor migration
and invasion [32–34]. The second significant pathway
was focal adhesion, in which kinase gene amplification
was significantly correlated with cancer progression
and poor prognosis in GC [35]. In this pathway, 21 core
miRNAs were identified (Supplementary Table S6). These
dysfunctional miRNAs may cooperatively change the
activity of the original pathway by regulating their targets.
The reciprocal analysis (GC > Normal) did not
yield any significant pathway with FDR<0.01; however,
two pathways fell just short of the significance threshold
(FDR < 0.01) (Table 2). These two pathways are the
one carbon pool by folate pathway correlated with the
chemoprevention of gastric carcinogenesis [36], and the
amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway
which may be related to gastric cancer risk [37]. As these
pathways were enriched with up-regulated miRNAs in the
GC samples, their activity may be altered by the miRNAs
in the development of GC.

Analyses of gastric adenocarcinoma data
The second case we chose to evaluate was miRNA
expression data of gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) [28].
This dataset compiles the expression of miRNAs from 60
primary GC tissues and eight surrounding non-cancerous
tissues. We applied MiRSEA to this dataset, with the full
list of ranked pathways shown in Supplementary Table S4.
With FDR < 0.01, the Normal > GC analysis
identified 15 significant pathways enriched by downregulated miRNAs in the GC samples (Table 2). These
include pathways involving leukocyte transendothelial
migration, focal adhesion, Fc gamma R-mediated
phagocytosis and selenoamino acids metabolism. These
pathways were enriched with miRNAs associated with
normal tissue function, and their dysfunction may
promote the generation and development of GC. For
instance, the most significant pathway involved leukocyte
transendothelial migration, which was reported to be a
critical component in tumor progression [29]. For this
pathway, the miRNA enrichment score was obtained by
calculation of the running-sum statistic (Figure 3A), and
13 core miRNAs were identified (Supplementary Table
S5). The core miRNAs, including miR-204, miR-133a
and miR-610, were down-regulated in GC samples (Figure
3B) and are clearly correlated with gastric cancer. Sacconi
et al. showed that down-regulation of miR-204 promoted
colony-forming ability, migration and tumor engraftment
of GC cells [30]. And miR-133a was proposed to be
correlated with the proliferation, invasion and cell cycle
progression of GC cells [31]. Finally, Wang et al. found
that miR-610 functioned as a tumor suppressor miRNA
and was down-regulated in GC, which may represent a
novel therapeutic approach to limit GC metastasis [32].
These core miRNAs may modulate their pathways
through their targets in the pathway. We further mapped
the targets of these core miRNAs to the original pathway
and found a number of genes were targeted (Figure 3C).
Interestingly, overexpression of these targets, such as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Analyses of lung cancer data
To further evaluate the results of MiRSEA, we
utilized sample-matched miRNA-mRNA expression
datasets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC;
GSE29248 and GSE29249) [49], which included six
NSCLC tissues and six adjacent normal tissues. We first
applied MiRSEA to the miRNA expression data and then
validated the results using the sample-matched mRNA
expression data. With FDR < 0.01, MiRSEA found 64
significant pathways enriched by up-regulated miRNAs
in NSCLC. These pathways, such as the gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) signaling, Fc gamma
R-mediated phagocytosis and gap junction pathway, have
been well reported to be associated with the initiation
and development of NSCLC in the published literatures
[38–40]. To verify if these pathways were modulated
by dysregulated miRNAs, we examined changes in the
expression of genes targeted by dysregulated miRNAs
in the pathways. For the GnRH signaling pathway, we
identified 22 core miRNAs that were up-regulated in
NSCLC (Supplementary Figure S2A). By intersecting
the targets of core miRNAs and genes in the pathway,
we obtained 25 genes. Interestingly, 72% (18/25) of the
intersecting genes were down-regulated in the NSCLC
samples (Supplementary Figure S2B). In the same way,
we found that 62% (18/29) and 52% (11/21) of the
intersecting genes were down-regulated in the Fc gamma
R-mediated phagocytosis and gap junction pathways,
respectively (Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). These
results indicate that the pathways identified by MiRSEA
may be controlled by dysregulated miRNAs in NSCLC.
To determine if MiRSEA could obtain consistent
results, we applied MiRSEA to another NSCLC dataset
(GSE36681). With FDR<0.01, 56 significant pathways

Comparison of MiRSEA with two other methods

were identified. We compared the results from GSE29248
and GSE36681 datasets. To provide a more general
comparison, we used the top 30 pathways from each
dataset to test how many pathways are overlapped. The
results showed that approximately 50% (14/30) pathways
were shared between the two datasets (Figure 4A). These
pathways include the insulin signaling pathway, hedgehog
signaling pathway and focal adhesion pathway, which
have been demonstrated to be correlated with NSCLC in
published literature [41–43]. Furthermore, the NSCLC
pathway was also identified as overlapped between the
two datasets. We further tested if this pathway identified
from different datasets was regulated by the same
miRNAs. Interestingly, 33 and 36 core miRNAs were
identified in the NSCLC pathway from the GSE29248 and
GSE36681 datasets, respectively, of which 18 miRNAs
were shared (Figure 4B). The shared miRNAs include
miR-503, which is correlated with the development
of drug resistance in human NSCLC [44]; miR-34a,
which mediates suppression of Notch-1 expression in
NSCLC cell lines [45]; miR-128, shown to be correlated
with human NSCLC tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis [46]; and miR-106a and miR-192,
which are both overexpressed in NSCLC [47]. These core
miRNAs may contribute to altering the properties of the
NSCLC pathway. The above analyses thus indicate that
the MiRSEA method is able to provide consistent results
from different datasets with the same phenotype.

To further explore whether MiRSEA could provide
new biological insights, we compared the results of
MiRSEA with two other miRNA pathway analyses. The
first was enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes,
which has been widely used in recent studies (we here
refer to it as the Traditional method [5]). This method
identifies the original differentially-expressed miRNAs
and then maps their target genes to the pathways for
enrichment analysis. The second method was enrichment
analysis of miRNAs proposed by Godard et al. [7]. In
this method, miRNAs are mapped to a pathway when at
least one of their target genes is located in that pathway.
The enrichment analysis is conducted by comparing
differentially-expressed miRNAs to the lists of miRNAs
in different pathways. The differential expression analysis
was performed by Student t-test and the miRNAs with
FDR < 0.01 were deemed as differentially expressed.
We applied MiRSEA, the Traditional method
and the Godard et al. method to identify KEGG
pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs in five
cancer datasets, including human HCC (GSE36915),
gastric adenocarcinoma (GSE26595), oral carcinoma
(GSE45238), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (GSE56489)
and lung cancer (GSE36681). The number of pathways
detected by each method for all datasets is provided in
Supplementary Table S7. For the human HCC data,

MiRSEA identified 33 significant pathways (22 HCCdownregulated and11 HCC-upregulated pathways)
with a pathway significant threshold of FDR<0.01. In
contrast, the Traditional method found 60 significant
pathways (33 HCC-downregulated and 27 HCCupregulated pathways) and the Godard et al. method did

not identify any statistically significant pathways in the
HCC dataset. By comparing the results, 21 pathways
identified by MiRSEA were missed by the other two
methods (Supplementary Table S8). Interestingly, these
pathways, such as the sphingolipid metabolism pathway
[15], the phosphatidylinositol signaling system [23],

cysteine and methionine metabolism pathways [48]
and pyruvate metabolism [49], have been thoroughly
documented as related to HCC. These results indicate
that MiRSEA may be able to identify new pathways
regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs in the development
of HCC. Moreover, the MiRSEA method can identify the
core miRNAs for significant pathways which may alter
the activity of those pathways. Although the Traditional
method also identified several pathways exclusively, it
was found that even random and meaningless miRNA
lists produced significant functional pathways using this
method [6, 7]. Thus, the Traditional method is biased and
leads to inaccurate results. Additionally, the Godard et al.
method did not yield any statistically significant pathways.
This may have occurred because the Godard et al. method
uses only differentially-expressed miRNAs to identify
pathways and ignores the effect of several modestly
cancer-related miRNAs. Moreover, the extent to which
miRNAs are associated with pathways is ignored by this

method. In fact, the MiRSEA method, which integrates
the differential expression level of miRNAs and the extent
of miRNA- associated pathways, may complement the
Godard et al. method. In agreement with these results,
MiRSEA also identified three pathways in GC data, zero
pathways in oral carcinoma data, 40 pathways in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia data and nine pathways in lung
cancer data, which were missed by the other two methods.
These results indicate that MiRSEA may detect new
biological pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs.

DISCUSSION
MiRNAs are correlated with regulating DNA
replication, cell development, cell cycle and cell apoptosis
by inhibiting the expression of their target genes.
Dysfunctional miRNAs may promote the occurrence
and development of various cancers. In systems biology,
dysfunctional miRNAs may jointly activate or inhibit their

target genes and further alter the activity of their canonical
biological pathways. Thus, elucidating the pathways
regulated by a group of dysfunctional miRNAs may
help uncover the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases and
identify new drug targets. Here, MiRSEA was developed
to identify canonical pathways regulated by dysfunctional
miRNA sets. MiRSEA applies the degree to which
miRNAs are differentially expressed which has been
neglected by recent miRNA-pathway analyses. Moreover,
considering that a miRNA may be more likely to regulate
a pathway as the number of genes it targets in the pathway
increases, we used the hypergeometric test to calculate the
weight for each pair of miRNAs and pathways containing
the miRNA-target interaction (See Methods). However,
any other suitable metric, such as Bleazard’s unbiased
analysis [6], can be used to calculate this weight. To avoid
false positive interactions from miRNA-target prediction
algorithms, we collected experimentally validated
miRNA-target interaction data from four public databases
(miRTarBase (V4.5), TarBase (V6.0), miRecords (V4.0)
and mir2Disease). Using the miRNA-pathway weights, we
converted pathways of protein-coding genes into pathways
composed of miRNAs. Finally, we mapped the miRNA
expression data to the converted miRNA pathways, and
used the weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic to
perform direct enrichment analysis.
We applied the MiRSEA method to HCC, GC
and two NSCLC datasets. Based on these analyses, we
demonstrated that MiRSEA can effectively identify
pathways enriched by dysfunctional miRNAs. Moreover,
for each significant pathway, MiRSEA can provide the
core miRNAs which may alter pathway activity. For the
gastric adenocarcinoma data, the most significant pathway
was that for leukocyte transendothelial migration, in which
we identified 13 core miRNAs (Supplementary Table S5).
Most of these core miRNAs, including miR-204, miR-133a
and miR-610, have been clearly demonstrated to be
associated with gastric cancer in the published literature
[30–32]. Although the roles of some core miRNAs are
unknown in gastric cancer, their identification may help
biologists understand the pathogenic mechanism of cancer
and develop new therapeutic targets.
We also compared the results of MiRSEA with two
other miRNA pathway analyses, namely, what we call the
Traditional method [5] and the method of Godard et al.
[7], using five cancer datasets (Supplementary Table S7).
For instance, in the HCC dataset, MiRSEA identified
33 significant pathways (22 HCC-downregulated and
11 HCC-upregulated pathways) with FDR < 0.01, while
the Traditional method identified 60 significant pathways
(33 HCC-downregulated and 27 HCC-upregulated
pathways). By comparing these results, we found 21
pathways which were identified by MiRSEA as highly
related to HCC that were not detected by the Traditional
method, including pathways involving sphingolipid
metabolism [15], the phosphatidylinositol signaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

system [23], cysteine and methionine metabolism [48]
and pyruvate metabolism [49]. Although the Traditional
method also identified several pathways exclusively, it
has been shown to produce similar biological pathways
with even random and meaningless miRNA sets [6, 7].
Thus, the Traditional method is apparently biased and
may lead to inaccurate results. In addition, the Godard
et al. method yielded zero significant pathways. This
may have occurred because this method only compares
the lists of differentially-expressed miRNAs to the lists
of miRNAs in the different converted pathways, which
may ignore the effect of several modestly cancer-related
miRNAs. Moreover, the Godard et al. method performs
enrichment analysis directly based on miRNAs, regardless
of the number of genes in the pathway they targeted.
MiRSEA, which integrates the weight of miRNApathway association and miRNA differential expression
level, can effectively identify the pathways regulated by
dysfunctional miRNAs in the disease phenotype.
Some studies have integrated miRNA and gene
expression data to discover pathways regulated by
dysfunctional miRNAs [8, 9]. Although these studies
introduced more information for analysis and produced
several significant results, they still required both
miRNA and gene expression data, which may limit their
application. Thus, there remains an unfulfilled need for
more powerful and accurate tools to identify biological
pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs using only
miRNA expression data.
To make MiRSEA broadly applicable, MiRSEA
was implemented as a freely available R-based package
on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
MiRSEA/). The user only needs to input miRNA
expression data from normal and disease samples, and
the MiRSEA package will produce a prioritized list of
pathways regulated by dysfunctional miRNAs. MiRSEA
was applied to KEGG pathways in this study, but it can
also be applied to other pathway databases and functional
biological categories.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Experimentally-validated miRNA-target interactions
were used in the study. We collected the miRNA targets
from four public databases (miRTarBase (V4.5) [10],
TarBase (V6.0) [11], miRecords (V4.0) [12] and
mir2Disease [13]). For humans, 12 113 targets are
associated with 576 miRNAs in miRTarBase, 11 933
targets are associated with 217 miRNAs in TarBase, 1105
targets are associated with 244 miRNAs in miRecords
and 403 targets are associated with 181 miRNAs in
mir2Disease. We merged these databases to obtain 40
990 human-specific miRNA-target interactions including
15 917 genes and 879 miRNAs. Pathways of protein

coding genes were obtained from the KEGG database
[50]. Additionally, we downloaded 186 KEGG pathways
from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) [51].
To illustrate the effectiveness of MiRSEA, we used
three cases of miRNA expression profiles from the Gene
Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/). The first case was a human hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) analysis published by Shih et al.
(accession no. GSE36915) [14]. This data contains
miRNA expression profiles of 68 HCC and 21 non-tumor
liver tissues. The second case, obtained from Lim et al.,
was an analysis of miRNA expression in primary gastric
adenocarcinoma (GC; accession no. GSE26595) [28]
and includes data from 60 primary GC tissues and eight
surrounding non-cancerous tissues. The third case utilized
two independent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
datasets (accession no. GSE29248 [52] and GSE36681
[53]). One dataset analyzed six NSCLC cancer tissues and
six adjacent normal tissues, and the other examined 56
NSCLC cancer tissues and 56 uninvolved lungs.

overly narrow or broad functional categories, pathways
with more than 10 miRNAs and less than 200 miRNAs
were used for direct enrichment analysis in the following.

Calculating the enrichment score for each
converted pathway
If the miRNAs in a converted pathway possess both
large differential expression levels and miRNA-pathway
weights, that pathway will be regulated by the miRNAs
in a specific phenotype. We thus defined a miRScore to
integrate the differential expression level of the miRNA
and the miRNA-pathway weight. The formula for
miRScore is given by:
miRScore = (1 + Wi) × DEi)		

where Wi is the weight of miRNA i with a given
pathway and DEi is the differential expression level of
miRNA i. We used the signal-to-noise ratio (S2N) [51] to
evaluate the differential expression levels of miRNAs in
the study. However, any other suitable metric can be used.
A miRNA in a pathway with miRScore greatly different
from zero indicates that the miRNA would probably
regulate the pathway in the specific phenotype.
For a given pathway, the weight for each miRNA
in an expression profile associated with the pathway
was initially calculated. We then ranked the N miRNAs
in the profile to form a miRNA list L = <miR1, miR2, ...,
miRN> according to decreasing miRScore. We mapped the
miRNAs involved in the given pathway (miRNAs with
W > 0) to the ranked miRNA list L. Obviously, when the
miRNAs in a given pathway cluster at the top or bottom
of list L, that pathway may be regulated by a group of
dysfunctional miRNAs in the specific phenotype. We
used a weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic used
previously in the gene set enrichment analysis method [51]
to calculate a miRNA enrichment score (miRES), which
reflects the degree to which the pathway is overrepresented
toward the extremes (top or bottom) of the ranked miRNA
list L. The miRES was calculated by walking down the
ranked miRNA list L, increasing a running-sum statistic
when we encountered a miRNA in the pathway and
decreasing it when we encountered a miRNAs not in
the pathway. In detail, at a given position k in list L, we
evaluated the fraction of miRNAs in the pathway (Fhit)
weighted by their miRScores and the fraction of miRNAs
not in the pathway (Fmiss) as follows:

Converting pathways of protein-coding genes
into miRNA pathways
To perform direct enrichment analysis of miRNAs,
we converted pathways of protein-coding genes into
pathways of miRNAs. A miRNA primarily regulates
biological pathways through its targets. We defined a
weight of miRNAs associated with pathways (miRNApathway weight), which was used to reflect the strength
to which miRNAs regulate pathways. We used the
hypergeometric test to calculate the miRNA-pathway
weight for each pair of miRNAs and pathways. The weight
of the association between miRNA i and pathway j (Wij) is
given as follows:
Wij = 1 − p		
(1)

t  m − t 
 

x n − x
		
(2)
p =∑  
 m
x=r
 
n 
where m represents the number of genes in the
whole genome; t is the number of genes involved in
pathway j; n represents the number of targets of miRNA
i; r is the number of overlaps between targets of miRNA
i and genes in pathway j. In this way, each miRNA is
assigned a weight with pathway j. If miRNA i does not
target any one of the genes in pathway j, the Wij will be
zero; otherwise, Wij will be larger than zero, and a large
Wij indicates that miRNA i regulates pathway j to a
large extent. Thus, each pair of miRNAs and pathways
is assigned a weight. Then, we constructed a weighted
miRNA-pathway matrix. When Wij > 0, miRNA i was
mapped to pathway j to form a miRNA pathway. To avoid

the number of miRNAs in the list L not in the pathway.
With the position k walking down the miRNA list L,
the miRES of the pathway (miRES(P)) was calculated
as the maximum deviation from zero of Fhit−Fmiss. If the
miRNAs are randomly distributed in the miRNA list, the
miRES(P) will be relatively small, but if the miRNAs
cluster at the top or bottom of the list, the miRES(P) will
be high. The parameter q was used to weight miRNAs in
the pathway with their miRScores normalized by the sum
of the miRScores over all for the miRNAs in the pathway.
We set q = 1 for the examples in this study. For some
particular phenotypes, if only a small subset of miRNAs
in the pathways are overrepresented toward the extremes
in the miRNA list, it may be desirable to set q > 1. For
each converted miRNA pathway, the respective miRES
was calculated in the above way.
In a converted miRNA pathway, only a subset of
miRNAs in the pathway contributes to the miRES, and
these miRNAs will contribute to a biological process.
Thus, it is meaningful to extract the core miRNAs of the
converted miRNA pathways. Here, we defined the core
miRNAs in a pathway to be those miRNAs appearing in
the ranked miRNA list L at and before the point where
miRES(P) is obtained (or after if miRES(P) < 0).

We performed a phenotype-based permutation
test procedure, which preserves the complex correlation
structure of miRNA expression, to estimate the statistical
significance (empirical p-value) of the miRES for each
pathway. Specifically, we redistributed the phenotype
labels of miRNA expression data and recomputed the
miRES for the permuted data. This generates a background
set of miRES after performing N permutations, which
was designated as miRESperm. The empirical p-value was
computed as p-value=M/N, where M is the number of
miRESperm greater than the observed miRES(P) when the
observed miRES(P) > 0, or M is the number of miRESperm
less than the observed miRES(P) when the observed
miRES(P) < 0; N represents the number of permutation
times, and was set at 1000 in this study. The phenotypebased permutation preserves miRNA-miRNA correlations
and thus would be reasonable for biological assessment of
significance. To correct for multiple hypotheses testing, we
applied the false discovery rate (FDR) method proposed
by Benjamini and Hochberg [54] to adjust the empirical
p-value. In our study, the FDR at 0.05 was used as the
pathway significance threshold.
We further normalized the miRES for each converted
miRNA pathway to account for the size of the pathway
and allow inter-pathway comparisons with miRES. The
normalized miRNA enrichment scores (NmiRES) for
the pathways were produced by separately rescaling the
observed positive and negative enrichment scores by
