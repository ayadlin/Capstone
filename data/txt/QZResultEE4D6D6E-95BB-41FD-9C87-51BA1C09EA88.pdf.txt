ABSTRACT:
In human cells TORC1 mTOR (target of rapamycin) protein kinase complex
renders heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1) competent for stress activation. In
such cells, as well as in yeast, the selective TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin blocks this
activation in contrast to Hsp90 inhibitors which potently activate Hsf1. Potentially
therefore rapamycin could prevent the Hsf1 activation that frequently compromises
the efficiency of Hsp90 inhibitor cancer drugs. Little synergy was found between the
effects of rapamycin and the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol on yeast growth. However
certain rapamycin resistance mutations sensitised yeast to Hsp90 inhibitor treatment
and an Hsp90 mutation that overactivates Hsf1 sensitised cells to rapamycin.
Rapamycin inhibition of the yeast Hsf1 was abolished by this Hsp90 mutation, as
well as with the loss of Ppt1, the Hsp90-interacting protein phosphatase that is
the ortholog of mammalian PP5. Unexpectedly Hsf1 activation was found to have a
requirement for the rapamycin binding immunophilin FKBP12 even in the absence of
rapamycin, while TORC1 “bypass” strains revealed that the rapamycin inhibition of
yeast Hsf1 is not exerted through two of the major downstream targets of TORC1,
the protein phosphatase regulator Tap42 and the protein kinase Sch9 – the latter the
ortholog of human S6 protein kinase 1.
Significance: A problem with most of the Hsp90 inhibitor drugs now in cancer
clinic trials is that they potently activate Hsf1. This leads to an induction of heat shock
proteins, many of which have a “pro-survival” role in that they help protect cells from
apopotosis. As the activation of Hsf1 requires TORC1, inhibitors of mTOR kinase could
potentially block this activation of Hsf1 and be of value when used in combination
drug therapies with Hsp90 inhibitors. However many of the mechanistic details of
the TORC1 regulation of Hsf1, as well as the interplay between cellular resistances
to rapamycin and to Hsp90 inhibitors, still remain to be resolved.

chaperone function essential for the conformational
maturation, activation and maintenance of proteins
essential for sustaining all of the hallmarks of cancer. As
such it is now a prime target for drug development, with
several Hsp90 inhibitors currently in cancer clinic trials
[1, 2]. Inhibitors of Hsp90 may prove to be most useful
for treating those malignancies where the oncogene driver
(e.g. HER2, ALK) has a high dependency on Hsp90 or, in
situations such as multiple myeloma, where the buffering

of proteotoxic stress is critical for survival [2]. One factor
that often compromises the efficiency of these drugs is
their tendency to activate heat shock transcription factor 1
(Hsf1). This leads to the induction of heat shock proteins,
many of which have a “pro-survival” role in that they help
to protect cancer cells from apopotosis [2, 3]. Attention is
therefore being directed to developing combination drug
therapies that will enable a dual targetting of both Hsf1
and Hsp90 [4]. Like Hsp90, Hsf1 is itself a key permissive
factor in cancer progression [5] and overexpressed in
certain aggressive cancers (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma
[4]). Furthermore Hsf1 inhibition may not be toxic to
normal tissues since Hsf1 knockout mice are viable [5].
A number of small molecule inhibitors of Hsf1
have been identified [6-10]. However the recent discovery
that the activation of Hsf1 requires mTOR (target of
rapamycin) protein kinase [11] indicates the possibility
that TOR kinase inhibitors might be as effective as these
inhibitors which act directly on Hsf1 in blocking the Hsf1
activation with by Hsp90 inhibitor drug treatment. Until
now, studies that have investigated the combinatorial
use of the selective TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin with an
Hsp90 inhibitor have not addressed whether the observed
effects might be partly due to the rapamycin abrogating
the induction of Hsf1 [12-14]. However while this paper
was under review, an unbiased drug screen was reported
for compounds that could block the Hsf1-directed
increases in Hsp70 with Hsp90 inhibition. It revealed that
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR inhibitors
could effectively inhibit this increase and potentiate the
antitumour efficacy of an Hsp90 inhibitor in many in vivo
models [15].
As with both Hsp90 and Hsf1, mTOR is often
overactivated in cancer; certain gain of function mutations
in the mTOR kinase domain being tumorigenic in
animal models [16, 17]. This protein kinase forms the
catalytic subunit of two distinct multiprotein complexes
(TORC1/2), complexes which are central to many of the
pathways regulating cell growth and proliferation since
they act as the integration “hubs” for diverse signalling
inputs [16]. Studies of rapamycin, the natural antibiotic
identified as the first highly selective inhibitor of TORC1
(see below), either for treating cancer or to promote a
healthier, longer life have been well publicized (especially
since this agent has been shown to extend lifespan in
flies and mice [18, 19]). Unfortunately the results of the
cancer trials of rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogues)
have mostly been undistinguished, despite isolated
successes. In some cancer cells rapamycin actually
promotes oncogenic activity [13], due to an activation of
AKT and other signalling molecules of the IGF-1R/IRS1 signalling system which reflects the loss of a negative
feedback regulation on IRS-1 and TORC2 [20, 21]. In
addition it can increase NFκB activity and upregulate the
expression of IGF-1R and HER2 [22]. Rapamycin also
has some undesirable side effects, with low dose, long

term treatment inducing insulin resistance [23]. Attention
is therefore now being directed to the development of
inhibitors that will selectively target the catalytic site of
mTOR, drugs that will inhibit both TORC1 and TORC2
[24, 25] (identifier: www.clinicaltrials.gov). There are
indications that such drugs might be highly effective
when used in combination with Hsp90 inhibitors. Thus
both mTOR inhibitors [13] and Hsp90 inhibitors [1, 2]
exert potent antiangiogenic activity, with the expectation
that improved antiangiogenic therapies may result from
a combined use of these agents. The antiangiogenic
properties of the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin are partly
attributable to an inhibition of PI3/AKT signalling in
endothelial cells, a process strongly activated by vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [26]. The synergism
between rapamycin and Hsp90 inhibitors in cultured
breast cancer and multiple myeloma has generally been
attributed to key downstream targets of IRS-1 and TORC2
signalling being “clients” of Hsp90 [12, 13]. Indeed the
rapamycin-promoted oncogenic activity observed in
certain tumors employs a number of signaling components
highly dependent on Hsp90 (e.g. IGF-1R, IRS-1, HER2,
Erk). It should therefore be abrogated by Hsp90 inhibition.
However the discovery that the activation of Hsf1 in
human cells requires TORC1 [11], opens the possibility
that the results of combinatorial usage of rapamycin with
an Hsp90 inhibitor may be partly caused by the rapamycin
inhibition of TORC1 abolishing the Hsf1 activation with
inhibition of Hsp90.
In this study we have employed well-characterised
mutant strains of yeast to unravel specific details of the
interplay between cellular resistances to rapamycin and
an Hsp90 inhibitor; of the TORC1 regulation of Hsf1;
of whether the rapamycin inhibition of Hsf1 might be
overridden by Hsp90 inhibitor treatment; and of how
Hsp90 chaperone system defects might impact on the
rapamycin inhibition of Hsf1 activity.

RESULTS
Hsp90 inhibitor treatment does not sensitise yeast
cells to rapamycin.
On the basis of current evidence cellular resistances
to rapamycin and to Hsp90 inhibitors might be expected
to be, at least to a degree, interdependent. Firstly, both
in mammalian systems (see Introduction) and in yeast
[27] Hsp90 inhibitors activate Hsf1, whereas rapamycin
inhibits the activation of Hsf1 [11](see below). Secondly,
the activation of Hsf1 downregulates TORC1 activity
and sensitises yeast to rapamycin [28]. Initially therefore
we investigated whether there are any synergistic effects
between the inhibitory effects of rapamycin and an Hsp90
inhibitor on yeast growth and whether these might be

influenced by the loss of the inducible heat shock response.
For this analysis we used two yeast strains (NSY-A,
NSY-B; Table 1) which differ in whether they express
either a full length or a truncated (residue 1-583) forms
of Hsf1. The latter, a form of this transcription factor
that lacks the C-terminal activatory domain, provides the
Hsf1 function needed for growth to 37°C yet lacks much
of the inducible heat shock response [29, 30]. The cells
expressing this truncated (1-583) Hsf1 were appreciably
more sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol, consistent
with their lower levels of Hsp90 [31]. However they were
not sensitised to either rapamycin or caffeine (Fig. 1)(the
actions of caffeine in yeast having been largely attributed
to its inhibition of TORC1 [32]). Importantly, there was
very little synergy between the growth inhibitory effects
of the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol and either rapamycin or
caffeine, irrespective of whether the cells were expressing
the normal full length Hsf1 or the truncated (1-583) Hsf1
(Fig. 1). Therefore, though Hsp90 inhibition normally
leads to an activation of Hsf1 and the activation of Hsf1
in the absence of stress has the potential sensitise cells
to rapamycin [28], neither the presence nor absence
of a stress-activatable Hsf1 appeared to be causing any
appreciable synergy between the inhibitory effects of these
two drugs, at least in this model system.

mutations causing rapamycin resistance in yeast [33].
Resistance was generated either through the loss of the
immunophilin that binds rapamycin (FKBP12) or with
alterations to a conserved serine residue within the
FKBP12-rapamycin complex binding (FRB) domain of
either of the two distinct TOR proteins in yeast (S1972R in
Tor1 (the TOR1-1 allele); S1975I in Tor2 (TOR2-1)). Later
rapamycin resistance was demonstrated in mammalian
cells with the mutation of this conserved serine (S2035)
in the single mammalian TOR kinase, mTOR [34, 35].
Not only does the TOR1.1 mutation generate rapamycin
resistance, but it also diminishes Tor kinase activity [36].
Extending these studies in yeast we found that both TOR11 and TOR2-1 generated a partial sensitivity to radicicol
(Fig. 2a), the most potent natural inhibitor of Hsp90 [37].
Whilst assembly of the TORC1/2 complexes
needs the Hsp90 chaperone system [38] no evidence has
emerged to date to indicate that the enzymatic activities
of these complexes are Hsp90-dependent. Of TORC1/2
subunits, only Raptor (Kog1 in yeast) has been shown to
interact with Hsp90 [39, 40]. Therefore we investigated
whether this effect of TOR1-1 and TOR2-1 sensitising
cells to Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig. 2a) might be correlated with
an altered regulation of Hsf1. Consistent with this, it was
found that these mutations reduced the cellular capacity
for induction of a heat shock element (HSE) driven
β-galactosidase gene reporter of Hsf1 activity (HSE-lacZ;
Fig. 2b). An increased sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition
and dramatically lowered HSE-lacZ induction were also
found in the tor1Δ mutant (Figs. 2a, 3a,c), a strain which
has lowered TORC1 kinase activity due to its lack of the

As described above, rapamycin resistance also arises
with the loss of FKBP12, the immunophilin that binds
rapamycin. When we investigated HSE-lacZ expression

Hsf1 activation is lost in yeast, not just with the
rapamycin inhibition of TORC1, but also with
loss of the rapamycin binding immunophilin
FKBP12.
The requirement for TORC1 to render Hsf1
competent for stress activation is clearly apparent from the
effects of the selective TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. We
found that in yeast, as in human cells [11], administration
of this antibiotic rapidly abolished Hsf1 induction (Figs.
2b; 3a,c). Rapamycin must be exerting this effect through
its inhibition of TORC1, since it did not inhibit the stress
induction of Hsf1 in TOR1-1 and TOR2-1 strains, where
the above mutations are causing a genetically dominant

Fig. 3a) we unexpectedly found an almost total absence
of stress activation even in the absence of rapamycin. An
FPR1 gene-bearing plasmid was able to restore HSE-lacZ
activation in this strain (Fig. 3b). Therefore the stress
activation of Hsf1 in yeast has a hitherto undiscovered
requirement for FKBP12.
Binding of the inhibitory FKBP12/rapamycin
complex to TORC1 is known not to require the peptidyl
prolyl isomerise activity of the immunophilin FKBP12
[34]. To analyse whether the activation of Hsf1 has a
requirement for this peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity

we expressed both wild type and F43Y mutant forms of
FKBP12 in fpr1Δ cells. F43Y corresponds to a mutation
which, in the human FKBP12, lowers the peptidyl prolyl
isomerise activity 1000-fold [34]. This F43Y mutation did
not abolish the capacity of an introduced FPR1 gene to
rescue stress activation of Hsf1 in fpr1Δ cells (Fig. 3b),
revealing that FKBP12 does not require its peptidyl prolyl
isomerase activity in order to facilitate the activation of
Hsf1.
The Hsf1 activation defects of tor1Δ and fpr1Δ
mutant cells (Fig. 3a) are one probable reason why both of

these mutants are slightly temperature sensitive (identifier:

temperatures did the loss of FKBP12 cause an increased

by other protein kinases (Sch9 by Pkh1/2, functional
orthologs of mammalian phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase 1; Atg13 by protein kinase A [43]). Tap42 is
rendered constitutively active and independent of upstream
signals from TORC1 with the loss of its negative regulator,
Tip41 [44]. Sch9, the protein kinase whose inactivation
causes most of the rapamycin-induced changes to the yeast
phosphoproteome [45], is rendered constitutively active
and independent of upstream signals from TORC1 when
the amino acids normally phosphorylated by TORC1 at its
C-terminus are replaced by acidic residues (the Sch92D3E
allele [41]).
To determine whether the TORC1 regulation of
Hsf1 in yeast (Fig. 2b,c) acts through either Tap42 or
Sch9 we investigated how rapamycin affects the stress
induction of Hsf1 in TORC1 bypass (tip41Δ, Sch92D3E
single mutant and tip41Δ, Sch92D3E double mutant) strains
(Table 1). We were unable to detect any altered sensitivity
to Hsp90 inhibitors in such strains (not shown). Hsf1
induction was still inhibited by rapamycin in tip41Δ
cells, lacking the TORC1 regulation of Tap42; Sch92D3E
cells lacking the TORC1 regulation of Sch9; as well as
in the tip41Δ, Sch92D3E double mutant (Fig. 4). Therefore

Rapamycin inhibition of Hsf1 is not exerted
through the TORC1 regulation of Tap42 or Sch9,
the latter the ortholog of mammalian S6 protein
kinase 1.
In yeast one can address the issue of whether the
TORC1 activation of Hsf1 is direct, or operates through
the known signalling events downstream of TORC1.
This model organism can be engineered so that each
downstream target phosphorylated by TORC1 is rendered
independent of TORC1 activity [41]. Yeast TORC1 is
known to directly phosphorylate Tap42 (a regulator of
PP2A and PP2A-like protein phosphatases [42]), Sch9
(the budding yeast ortholog of the mammalian S6 protein
kinase 1 (S6K1) [41]) and Atg13, a subunit of the Atg1
kinase complex. All three targets are also regulated

the Hsf1 inactivation upon rapamycin inhibition of
TORC1 (Fig. 2b) does not involve the downregulation of
TORC1 signalling through either Tap42 or Sch9. Instead
it is possible that TORC1 acts more directly upon Hsf1 in
order to render the latter competent for stress activation. It
should be noted that a number of the strains studied here
(e.g. TOR1-1 and TOR2-1 (Fig. 2b); Sch92D3E (Fig. 4)) are
also defective in the rapamycin-mediated phosphorylation
of eIF2α, leading to downregulation of protein synthesis
[41]. The rapid rapamycin inhibitions of HSE-lacZ
expression, measured as loss of β-galactosidase induction
in these experiments (Figs. 2b, 3a,c), are primarily not
therefore a reflection of the general downregulation of
protein synthesis which normally accompanies the loss of
Sch9 activity.

another strain in which the sole Hsp90 lacks its terminal
–EEVD motif (PP30-hsp82(-EEVD); Table 1). In this
PP30-hsp82(-EEVD) the HSE-lacZ induction with stress
was only partially abolished under our conditions of
rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5d). In contrast to hsp82-E381K
cells, with their high basal HSE-lacZ expression (Fig.
5b), the ppt1∆ mutant and the cells in which the Hsp90
lacks the terminal –EEVD displayed essentially unaltered
basal levels of HSE-lacZ expression (Fig. 5) as well as
sensitivities to radicicol and rapamycin (not shown).
Together these results provide the first demonstration
that the rapamycin inhibition of Hsf1 can be lost through
Hsp90 mutation or with the loss of an Hsp90 system
cochaperone. Rapamycin inhibition of Hsf1 is also lost
with rapamycin resistance mutations (Fig. 2b), but these
act by abolishing the rapamycin/FKBP12 complex binding
to TORC1. In contrast the Hsp90 system defects analysed
here do not generate rapamycin resistance (hsp82-E381K
instead sensitising cells to this antibiotic (Fig. 5a)). It
is quite probable therefore that these Hsp90 chaperone
defects are preventing the rapamycin inhibition of HSElacZ induction at the level of the Hsp90 suppression of
Hsf1 activity.

Rapamycin inhibition of Hsf1 can be lost with
mutation of the Hsp90 chaperone system.
Hsp90 inhibitors potently activate Hsf1, due to the
inverse correlation between the activity of Hsf1 and the
activity of the Hsp90 chaperone. The resultant induction
of antiapoptotic heat shock proteins is one of the main
drawbacks to the use of these drugs in cancer therapy (see
Introduction). In yeast, los of this Hsp90 suppression of
Hsf1 can occur not just through Hsp90 inhibitor treatment
[27], but also with mutation to Hsp90 itself (e.g. the
hsp82-E381K mutant [27, 46]) and with defects in certain
nonessential cochaperones of the Hsp90 chaperone
system [47]. Strain PP30-hsp82(E381K)(Table 1) possess
a point mutation in its Hsp90 that causes its Hsf1 to be
constitutively hyperactive even in the absence of stress
[46] (this Hsf1 activation possibly being the reason
this strain displays an increased sensitivity to Hsp90
inhibitors [27]). We found that this PP30-hsp82(E381K)
also exhibits an extreme, FKBP12 (Fpr1)-dependent
hypersensitivity to rapamycin (its growth being inhibited
by just 1-2nM rapamycin; Fig. 5a). This sensitisation to
rapamycin can be attributed to its high Hsf1 activity, since
Hsf1 activation in the absence of heat stress is known to
enhance sensitivity to rapamycin [28]. Moreover, unlike
the normal Hsf1 activity of PP30-HSP82 cells expressing
the wild type Hsp82, this elevated Hsf1 activity of PP30hsp82(E381K) - though still FKBP12-dependent - was not
subject to inhibition by rapamycin (Fig. 5b).
We found that rapamycin also did not inhibit the
activation of Hsf1 in cells that lack the serine/threonine
protein phosphatase Ppt1 (the ppt1∆ mutant, Fig. 5c). Ppt1,
the yeast ortholog of mammalian protein phosphatase 5
(PP5), is a dedicated regulator of the Hsp90 chaperone
system, its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs)
interacting with the -EEVD motif found at the extreme
C-terminus of cytosolic Hsp90s [48]. Finding that this
ppt1∆ strain displayed a normal HSE-lacZ induction with
stress, not inhibited by rapamycin, led us to investigate

DISCUSSION
It is important to develop strategies for the
inhibition of Hsf1, since this transcription factor is a
driver of cancer progression and the Hsf1-directed heat
shock response frequently causes a degree of resistance
to Hsp90 inhibitor cancer drugs (see Introduction). This
study has exploited well characterised mutants of yeast
to investigate the rapamycin inhibition of the native Hsf1
in this model organism; as well as how this is inhibition
might be affected by the inhibition and mutation of the
Hsp90 chaperone machine. Both in yeast and in human
cells rapamycin and Hsp90 inhibitors have potent, yet
opposing, effects on the activity of Hsf1. Rapamycin is
an inhibitor of Hsf1 activity (Fig. 2b) [11], while Hsp90
inhibitors are activators of Hsf1. The issue therefore
arises of what happens to both growth inhibition and Hsf1
activity when rapamycin is used in combination with an
Hsp90 inhibitor.
In this study we found little synergy between the
inhibitory effects of rapamycin and the Hsp90 inhibitor
radicicol on the growth of yeast, irrespective of whether
the cells possessed a stress-inducible form of Hsf1 (Fig.
1). This may be due to an overriding effect of rapamycin,
which rapidly blocked any Hsf1 induction by the Hsp90
inhibitor (Fig. 3a). Such findings contrast with those of
a recent study in which mTOR inhibitors were found to
potentiate the efficacy of the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib
in several tumor cell lines [15]. Such differences - yeast
versus tumor cells - are perhaps to be expected, especially
considering the considerably less complex role of TORC1
in yeast as compared to mammalian systems.

The novelty of this work is that it has provided the
first demonstration that Hsp90 inhibitor resistance can be
influenced by mutations causing resistance to rapamycin
(Fig. 2a) and, conversely, that rapamycin resistance can be
influenced by mutations in the Hsp90 chaperone machine
(Fig. 5a). While rapamycin inhibits the activation of Hsf1,
it is without any appreciable effect on immediate HSElacZ expression in cells that substantially lack an inducible
Hsf1 (e.g. tor1∆, fpr1∆; Fig. 3a). In yeast this inhibition of
Hsf1 is not exerted through either Tap42 or Sch9, major
downstream targets phosphorylated by TORC1 (Fig. 4). It
may therefore reflect a more direct TORC1 activation of
Hsf1. In human cells Hsf1 activation is known to require
its TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of serine 326 [11].
The phosphorylation of this serine residue is attracting
increased attention as a marker of the highly malignant
state [49].
This study found that the TOR1.1, TOR2.1 and
fpr1Δ rapamycin resistance mutations sensitise cells to
Hsp90 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 2a, 3c) and abrogate the
inducible heat shock response even in the absence of
rapamycin (Fig. 2b,3a); that the rapamycin inhibition of
Hsf1 activation does not involve the downstream TORC1
regulation of Tap42 or Sch9; also that the rapamycin
inhibition of Hsf1 can be overridden by Hsp90 mutation
and with loss of an Hsp90 system cochaperone (Fig. 5).
Notably we find that Hsf1 activation has a requirement for
the rapamycin-binding immunophilin FKBP12, though not
the peptidyl prolyl isomerise activity of this FKBP12 (Fig.
3). It will be interesting to discover if the Hsf1 activation
in human cells has a similar requirement for the conserved
immunophilin FKBP12.
In mammalian systems, the signalling downstream
of TORC1 is considerably more complex than in yeast.
However much of it still operates through S6K1 [16].
An extension of these yeast genetic studies therefore has
the potential to reveal yet more details of how TORC1
regulates Hsf1, how the inhibition of TORC1 acts to
suppress the inducible heat shock response and how this
inhibition, in turn, impacts on the Hsp90 suppression of
Hsf1 activity. Many of the mechanisms uncovered this
way are likely to be conserved, yeast to man. Furthermore
the human Hsf1 can, by mutation, be rendered functional
in yeast whereupon much of its regulation is found to be
conserved in this model eukaryote [50, 51].
In aging cells and tissues the levels of TORC1
activity are one of the factors driving senescence, with
the result that decreases in this activity have the potential
to slow aging [52]. In cancer drug therapy the aim is
generally a downregulation of mTOR and Hsf1, whereas
in healthy aging an increased Hsf1 activity should
potentially be beneficial in that it will increase chaperone
levels, thereby causing the improved proteostasis that
could counteract sarcopenia and neurodegenerative disease
[3, 10]. This study has found that the TORC1 regulation
of the transient heat shock response of vegetative yeast
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

occurs independently of Sch9 (ortholog of S6K1; Fig. 4).
However a decreased activity of S6K, yet an increased
activity of Hsf1 are increasingly being identified as two
factors important for extending the chronological lifespan
of model organisms [18, 19]. They are also - at least to
a degree - interdependent, Hsf1 being essential for the
extension to lifespan when S6K is downregulated in aging
Caenorhabditis elegans [53]. Future studies will therefore
need to address the issue of whether the TORC1 regulation
of Hsf1, studied here in the inducible heat shock response
of vegetative yeast cells, differs from how TORC1 might
regulate Hsf1 in the normal processes of aging.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table
1. These were routinely maintained on YPD (2% (w/v)
bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) 1.5% agar
plates. Transformations with a URA3 vector bearing a
LacZ gene under heat shock element control (HSE-LacZ)
and measurement of levels of β-galactosidase expression
were as previously described [27]. Cultures containing this
plasmid were grown on standard defined (SD) minus uracil
dropout medium and subjected to stress and/or antibiotic
treatment as described in the figure legends. For the study
in Fig. 3c strain BY4741 fpr1∆ containing this HSE-LacZ
vector was transformed with additional YCplac111-based
LEU2 vectors bearing either the wild type or F43Y mutant
forms of the FPR1 gene under native promoter control,
then grown on SD minus uracil and leucine prior to
measurements of their HSE-LacZ expression.
For drug sensitivity assays, overnight YPD cultures
were either serially diluted, then pinned onto YPD agar
containing the indicated antibiotic and the plates incubated
as indicated in the figure legends; or they were inoculated
into complete SD medium (1x105 cells/ml), this dilution
being used to set up radicicol and rapamycin or radicicol
and caffeine dose response matrixes (final volume 0.2
ml/well) in 96-well microtiter plates. After 46h growth
at 28°C the cells were re-suspended by agitation, their
absorbance determined at 595 nm with a Multiskan Ascent
platereader with correction for the background from
the corresponding medium, and the data quantitatively
displayed with color using the program Java Treeview
1.1.3 (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/).
