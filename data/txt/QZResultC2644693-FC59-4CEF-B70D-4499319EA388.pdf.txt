Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a vital role in
tumor angiogenesis. VEGF is produced by human melanomas,
and the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is expressed by most
advanced stage melanomas, suggesting the possibility of an
autocrine loop. Here, we show that bevacizumab, an antiVEGF antibody, inhibits proliferation of VEGFR-2+ melanoma
cell lines by an average of 41%; however, it failed to inhibit
proliferation of VEGFR-2neg melanoma cell lines. The growth
inhibitory effect of bevacizumab was eliminated by VEGFR-2
knockdown with small interfering RNA, showing that VEGF
autocrine growth in melanoma is mediated through VEGFR-2.
However, bevacizumab inhibition of autocrine signals did not
completely inhibit cell proliferation nor cause cell death. Cell
survival is mediated partially through mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), which is inhibited by rapamycin. Combination of bevacizumab with rapamycin caused loss of half of
the VEGFR-2+ melanoma cells, but no reduction in the number
of VEGFR-2neg melanoma cells. The results show (a) an
autocrine growth loop active in VEGFR-2+ melanoma, (b)
a nonangiogenic mechanism for inhibition of melanoma by
blocking autocrine VEGFR-2 activation, and (c) a possible
therapeutic role for combination of inhibitors of mTOR plus
VEGF in selected melanomas. [Cancer Res 2008;68(11):4392–7]

Introduction
Malignant melanoma remains poorly responsive to systemic
therapy. Treatments targeting molecular changes that underlie
malignant behavior hold promise. Such approaches may target
cell signaling pathways critical for cancer growth and survival or
tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. However, the clinical benefit
of targeted therapies as single agents has been less than desired.
We are interested in enhancing antitumor effects in melanoma by
combining targeted therapies that inhibit growth and survival of
melanoma cells. We previously showed melanoma proliferation
was inhibited by low-dose rapamycin (1), a drug that inhibits
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and is a Food and Drug Administration–
approved agent for immunosuppression posttransplant. The

Clinical Trials Evaluation Program of the NIH has initiated a
program of clinical trials of combination therapies for selected
malignancies.
Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a humanized anti–vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody approved for therapy
of colorectal and lung cancers based on a significant increase in
survival, when given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy
(2). This agent was developed to block angiogenesis, a critical
process for the survival of tumors as they increase in size (3, 4).
Recognition of VEGF as an angiogenic factor was followed by the
discovery that it is produced by both cancer cells and stromal cells,
creating a microenvironment favorable for tumor growth (5–10).
Production of VEGF seems to be an integral part of melanoma
cancer progression because normal melanocytes do not produce
it (11, 12), whereas tumor-derived melanoma cell lines express it
(12–14). VEGF expression is up-regulated in melanoma cells (15),
and elevated serum VEGF levels directly correlate with stage of
disease progression in melanoma patients (16, 17). The VEGF
receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is the major mediator of mitogenic, angiogenic, and permeability-enhancing effects of VEGF (3). VEGFRs are
not expressed on normal melanocytes (11, 15, 18), but VEGFR-2
expression is up-regulated in some human melanoma cells during
malignant transformation (15). These results suggest a role of
VEGF in the development and progression of melanomas. Expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 by some human melanoma cells raises
the possibility that VEGF may be an autocrine growth factor for
some human melanoma cells. Therefore, bevacizumab might have
an effect on melanomas, independent of its antiangiogenic effects.
Here, we tested bevacizumab and rapamycin, singly and in
combination, for their effects on proliferation of multiple tumorderived human melanoma cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Melanoma cell lines used in this study were cultured from
tumor-involved lymph nodes surgically resected from patients at University
of Virginia (VMM5A, VMM14, VMM15, VMM17, VMM18, and VMM39) or
from patients at Duke University (DM6, DM13, DM93, DM122, and DM331)
as described previously (1, 19–21). The VMM1 melanoma cell line was
derived from a metastatic tumor in the brain surgically resected from a
patient at University of Virginia (21). SKMel24 and HT144 were both
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. All of the cell lines were
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin
(100 Ag/mL) at 37 jC in 5% CO2, unless otherwise indicated.
Reagents and inhibitors. One hundred milligrams (25 mg/mL) of
bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech List No. 15734) was purchased from
University of Virginia Hospital Pharmacy and used at 50 Ag/mL in cell

and the levels were normalized to the geometric mean of GAPDH and HPRT1
as controls. Results are plotted on a logarithmic scale to allow comparison of the
1,000-fold range in mRNA levels. Error bars, SD from triplicate samples. The

amount of GAPDH, and plotted (B ) relative to DM13 (set as 100). The cell lines
are arranged in the same order as in A.

number assays. Rapamycin (R-5000) was purchased from LC Laboratories,
and a stock solution was made in DMSO and used at 1 nmol/L in cell
number assays.
Assay of cell number. Melanoma cells (1,000 cells per well) were plated
in triplicate in 96-well plates with 5% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight.
After 12 to 16 h, the cells were washed and treated with serum alone or with
inhibitors, as indicated. Cell numbers were assayed 48 h later (or 7 d later
for Fig. 4C) using Cell Titer-Glo (Promega), according to the instructions
provided by the manufacturer. This assay uses luciferase to measure ATP;
because ATP levels are kept constant in living cells, the level is proportional
to the number of viable cells (22). Relative light units (RLU) measured in
that assay are used to determine the number of viable cells. The assay has
been validated and used extensively in lieu of other assays, such as

reduction of chromogenic substrates [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] or pulse-labeling of DNA synthesis (23, 24).
Statistical analysis. The logarithm transformation of the RLUs (raw
data), instead of cell numbers calculated from RLUs, was the outcome for
analysis, and linear regression was performed. The six cell lines were
grouped into either high or low VEGFR-2 expression. Within either group,
several comparisons were examined, including effects of individual drugs
(in serum-containing media) versus the control serum, as well as the effects
of both drugs given in combination versus the control serum, each drug
alone, and the expected effects of the two drugs working in combination but
acting independently. These comparisons were analyzed for significant
differences between the VEGFR-2 high and low groups.
Western blot analysis. For analysis of proteins, cells from all 14
melanoma lines (VMM18, HT144, VMM5A, DM331, DM13, DM6, SKMel24,
VMM15, VMM14, VMM1, VMM17, VMM39, DM93, and DM122) were plated
in 100 mm Petri dishes and incubated for 24 h in RPMI medium plus 5%
FBS. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed twice
with 10 mL PBS, harvested, and lysed, as described previously (1). Protein
yields were determined by bicinchoninic acid analysis. Proteins were
resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer and heated for 10 min at
100jC, and 20 Ag/lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels and
transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 1%
bovine serum albumin in 50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20, and 0.01% antifoam A. Membranes were probed with antibodies
listed below. Proteins were detected with Pierce SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent substrate as recommended by the manufacturer and
used to expose to Kodak BioMax film.
Antibodies. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (used at 1:500) was purchased from Chemicon International. Anti–
VEGFR-2 antibody (used at 1:1,000) was purchased from Cell Signaling.
Anti-VEGF antibody (used at 1:1,000) was purchased from Abcam. This is an
antibody to VEGF-A. Anti–phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein
kinase [MAPK; extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)], clone
12D4 antibody (used at 1:500), was purchased from Upstate. Anti-mouse
IgG, peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibody from sheep,
secondary antibody (used at 1:5,000), and anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-linked
species-specific whole secondary antibody from donkey (used at 1:5,000)
were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA samples were obtained using
the RNEasy mini kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen).
Reverse transcription was done with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase
(Applied Biosystems) and random hexamers, as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. The resulting cDNA was then subjected to quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously (25). The data collected from
these quantitative PCRs defined a threshold cycle (C t) of detection for the
target (VEGFR-2) or the control genes [GAPDH and hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1)] in each cDNA sample. To convert
the C t value into a relative abundance of target and control gene per
sample, a standard curve was generated for the control gene using serial
dilutions of cDNA sample: an arbitrary value of template was first assigned
to the highest standard and then corresponding values were assigned to the
subsequent dilutions, and these relative values were plotted against the C t
value determined for each dilution, resulting in the generation of the
standard curve. The relative amount of target and control genes in each
sample was then determined using the comparative C t method (Applied
Biosystems). The ratios of VEGFR-2 transcript are normalized by the
geometric mean of the two control genes, GAPDH and HPRT1, and are
plotted on the graph.
ELISA. For the quantitative determination of VEGF concentrations from
each of the 14 melanoma cell cultures, 2.5  106 melanoma cells were plated
on 100-mm dishes in 5 mL and the medium was collected 24 h later. ELISA
was performed with the Quantikine Immunoassay to Human VEGF kit
(R&D Systems), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer,
with the exception that 100 AL of medium was used. A standard curve was
generated using the supplied reagents, VEGF (pg/mL) was determined for
each of the melanoma cell supernatants using the average value from
triplicate samples, and medium with serum was used as a blank.

Results

Figure 2. Expression of VEGF by human melanoma cell lines. A , Western
blot analysis of VEGFR-2+ and VEGFR-2neg melanoma cell lines with VEGF
antibody (top ) as described in Materials and Methods. GAPDH was
immunoblotted as a loading control (bottom ). B, ELISA for analysis of
secreted VEGF collected from human melanoma cell lines after 24 h in culture
(in pg/mL). DM331 was too high to measure. The melanoma cell lines are in
the same rank order as Fig. 1A .

Small interfering RNA experiments. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
oligonucleotides that target VEGFR-2 and a nontargeting siRNA pool were
purchased from Upstate and resuspended according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For transfection, 1  106 melanoma cells (DM6 and VMM18)
were used in each condition (100 nmol/L SMARTpool or nonspecific
negative control) with the Amaxa nucleofector kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions, and plated into each well of a 12-well dish and

VEGFR-2 in melanoma cell lines. Levels of VEGFR-2 mRNA
and protein were analyzed in 14 melanoma cell lines (Fig. 1). qRTPCR for VEGFR-2 expression revealed mRNA in all 14 cell lines;
however, the expression varied over a 1,000-fold range, normalized
with GAPDH and HPRT1 (Fig. 1A, note a logarithmic scale).
Extracts of the 14 melanoma cell lines were analyzed by
immunoblotting for VEGFR-2 protein and quantitated by densitometry normalized to GAPDH as a loading control (Fig. 1B and C).
The results revealed that seven of the eight cell lines with the
highest mRNA levels also expressed VEGFR-2 protein. DM331 was
the exception in this group, without detectable VEGFR-2 protein.
None of the six melanoma cell lines with the lowest levels of mRNA
exhibited any VEGFR-2 protein (Fig. 1B). Among the cell lines that
expressed VEGFR-2 protein, the levels of protein did not
correspond to the relative levels of mRNA, suggesting that there
are posttranscriptional mechanisms for regulation of VEGFR-2.
From this set of 14 melanoma cell lines, we chose for further study
the three lines with the highest levels of VEGFR-2 protein (VMM18,
DM13, and DM6) and the three cell lines with the lowest levels of
mRNA and no detectable VEGFR-2 protein (DM122, DM93, and
VMM39).
VEGF in melanoma cell lines. Western blotting showed that
melanoma cell lines expressed VEGF, whether or not they
expressed VEGFR-2 (Fig. 2A). As expected, RT-PCR analysis showed
VEGF mRNA was expressed in all six of these cell lines (not shown).
We also analyzed, by ELISA, VEGF secreted from all 14 melanoma
cell lines (Fig. 2B). There was greater than a 3,000-fold range in the
amount of secreted VEGF in the 14 melanoma cell lines. The data
for secreted VEGF are arranged in rank order based on the levels of
the VEGFR-2 mRNA (Fig. 1A). This shows there is no correspondence between the levels of secreted VEGF and the levels of
VEGFR-2 mRNA or VEGFR-2 protein. It seems that melanoma cell
lines independently produce VEGF and VEGFR-2.

Combined Inhibition of mTOR, VEGF/VEGFR-2 in Melanoma

Figure 4. Knockdown of VEGFR-2 prevents cell death in response to rapamycin
and bevacizumab. DM6 (A ) and VMM18 (B ) cell lines were transfected
with siRNA to VEGFR-2 (lane 2), as well as a nonspecific control (lane 1)
and analyzed by Western blot (insets of graphs ). Separate cultures of
siRNA-transfected DM6 and VMM18 cells were maintained in media plus
serum and treated without drug (white), bevacizumab (dotted), rapamycin
(hatched ), or a combination of bevacizumab and rapamycin (black ), as
indicated. C , relative cell number after 7 d of growth is plotted for VMM18 and

therapeutic human dosing (27). Bevacizumab added alone
significantly inhibited proliferation of the VEGFR-2+ cell lines
VMM18, DM13, and DM6 (P < 0.001), but did not inhibit
proliferation of cell lines without detectable VEGFR-2 protein
DM122, DM93, and VMM39 (P = 0.18). We concluded that there is
an autocrine loop where VEGF, which is produced by all of the
melanoma cell lines, promotes proliferation only of those
melanoma cell lines that express VEGFR-2.
Rapamycin added alone inhibited proliferation of all six
melanoma cell lines with a mean inhibition of 72% compared
with control (P < 0.001). Combination of bevacizumab plus
rapamycin did not just inhibit cell proliferation, but caused a net
loss of VEGFR-2+ cells, consistent with an induction of cell death.
In contrast, bevacizumab plus rapamycin had no additional effect
compared with rapamycin alone (77% versus 73%) in the VEGFR2–negative cell lines. Thus, bevacizumab does not have a
significant additive effect on melanoma cells without VEGFR-2,
whereas bevacizumab kills VEGFR-2+ melanoma cells in combination with rapamycin.
Knockdown of VEGFR-2 by siRNA prevents cell death from
combination of bevacizumab plus rapamycin. Bevacizumab
only had effects on VEGFR-2+ melanoma cells, and we wanted to
test whether the observed effects were dependent on VEGFR-2.
Using an siRNA SMARTpool for VEGFR-2 and a nonspecific siRNA
control, we knocked down VEGFR-2 in both the DM6 and VMM18
cell lines (Fig. 4A and B). Immunoblotting showed that the VEGFR2 siRNA resulted in the loss of detectable protein. Cell proliferation
assays showed that bevacizumab alone did not inhibit the VEGFR-2
knocked down cell lines compared with the same cell lines
transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 4A and B). Combination
treatment with bevacizumab plus rapamycin in the VEGFR-2
knocked down cell lines did not produce cell death and was no
different than treatment with rapamycin alone. These results show
that VEGFR-2 is necessary for the negative effects of bevacizumab
on melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for net cell death when
used in combination with rapamycin.
If VEGF was promoting melanoma cell growth with VEGFR-2,
then knockdown of the receptor would be expected to inhibit cell
proliferation. We did not detect an effect on proliferation at 48
hours; so to test this hypothesis, VMM18 and DM6 melanoma cell
lines were transfected in parallel with control siRNA or VEGFR-2
siRNA and evaluated at 7 days. Knockdown of VEGFR-2 reduced
cell proliferation in both VMM18 and DM6 by f50% (Fig. 4C).
Bevacizumab inhibited proliferation of VEGFR-2+ melanoma
cells; however, this did not involve significant reduction in ERK
activation. Immunoblotting for phosphorylated ERK was not
reduced in VMM18 cells treated with bevacizumab compared with
untreated controls (data not shown). Therefore, ERK activation did
not depend on VEGFR-2, and the VEGFR-2 receptor must have
other intracellular effectors that contribute to proliferation.

Discussion
Bevacizumab and rapamycin effects on melanoma cell
proliferation. We examined proliferation of human melanoma
cell lines in vitro and the effects of bevacizumab and rapamycin
individually and in combination (Fig. 3). Cells were grown with or
without bevacizumab at concentrations estimated to be achieved
in serum with therapeutic human dosing (26) and with or without
rapamycin below levels estimated to be achieved in serum with

www.aacrjournals.org

Our results show that VEGFR-2 renders melanomas especially
susceptible to combination therapy of bevacizumab plus rapamycin. The combination therapy is lethal to cells with VEGFR-2,
and knockdown of VEGFR-2 by siRNA renders them insensitive.
Thus, melanoma-derived VEGF can cause not only angiogenesis,
but also autocrine activation of tumor cells that express VEGFR-2.
This discovery may be useful to guide therapy for individual
patients.

The melanoma cell lines examined fell into two groups, VEGFR2+ and VEGFR-2neg. All 14 melanoma cell lines expressed VEGFR-2
transcript. However, only about half had detectable levels of the
VEGFR-2 protein, and these had high levels of mRNA. However,
some cell lines with high levels of mRNA had no detectable VEGFR2 protein; therefore, we suspect that there may be other modes of
regulation, such as microRNAs, that limit accumulation of the
protein even when the mRNA is expressed. Regardless of the
VEGFR-2 protein expression levels, we observed that every
melanoma cell line tested produced VEGF in secreted and cellbound forms. This is consistent with reports of VEGF in melanoma
patient biopsies, based on immunohistochemistry (12, 14, 28–31). It
also is consistent with prior reports with epithelial cancers of a
growth protective effect of VEGF induced by radiation exposure
(32–34).
VEGF has three receptors: VEGFR-1 is thought to be a less active
‘‘decoy receptor’’ (35), VEGFR-2 is a protein tyrosine kinase that
activates a variety of cell signaling pathways to promote cell
proliferation (36), and VEGFR-3 is closely related to VEGFR-2, but
its expression is primarily in lymphatic endothelial cells (35, 37).
VEGFR-2 is believed to be the dominant effector of VEGF function
on cells other than lymphatic endothelial cells (38). VEGFR-2 has
been found in 50% to 80% of melanomas by immunohistochemistry, with incidence increasing with advanced disease stage (11, 12,
16, 17, 31, 39). Using a receptor tyrosine kinase antibody array, we
detected selective activation of VEGFR-2 in VMM18 (a VEGFR-2+
cell line), but not in DM122 (a VEGFR-2neg cell line; data not
shown). Our hypothesis was that melanoma cells expressing
VEGFR-2 were dependent on VEGF for proliferation. We found
that bevacizumab inhibited the proliferation of three of three
VEGFR-2+ melanoma cell lines tested. Knockdown of VEGFR-2 by
siRNA prevented this inhibition. This showed that the response to
VEGF was due to VEGFR-2. Furthermore, knockdown of VEGFR-2
reduced the proliferation of VEGFR-2+ melanoma cell lines. Overall,
these findings show that melanoma-derived VEGF interacts with
cell-surface VEGFR-2 on melanoma cells, providing an autocrine
growth signal (15, 39–41).
Melanoma cell proliferation is thought to be mediated in part
through activation of the mTOR pathway. mTOR is an enzyme that

regulates translation and transcription during cell growth; thus, it
is a logical therapeutic target, and its inhibitors, rapamycin
(sirolimus) and CCI-779 (temsirolimus), may have therapeutic
potential in cancer. However, in clinical trials to date, clinical
activity of CCI-779 was low when it was used as a single agent in
melanoma patients (42). Clinical efficacy of mTOR inhibition likely
will require combination therapy that inhibits other growth
pathways as well.
VEGFR-2 is believed to signal cell proliferation and survival
through MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathways, but our prior results,
recently confirmed in other cancer cell lines, showed crosstalk between these pathways (1, 43). We did not find evidence
of decreased activation of ERK with inhibition of VEGF,
which suggests that the effect of VEGFR-2 on melanoma cell
proliferation is mediated through other pathways. It is also
possible that VEGFR-2 signaling may differ in melanomas with or
without BRAF or RAS mutations. Additional studies are planned
for elucidating the downstream effects of blocking the VEGF/
VEGFR-2 autocrine loop. Regardless, the combination of bevacizumab plus rapamycin causes not only synergistic inhibition of
proliferation, but also death of human melanoma cells expressing
VEGFR-2. These data provide rationale for combination therapy
with inhibitors of VEGF and mTOR in patients with VEGFR-2+
melanomas.
