ABSTRACT
Background: Second-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients includes monotherapy with a third-generation cytotoxic drug (CT)
or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). These options are the actual standard for EGFR
wild-type (WT) status, as patients with EGFR mutations achieve greater benefit by the
use of TKI in first-line treatment. Some clinical trials and meta-analyses investigated
the comparison between CT and TKI in second-line, but data are conflicting.
Methods: We designed a retrospective trial to gather information about TKI
sensitivity in comparison with CT. We selected from clinical records patients treated
with at least 1 line of CT and at least 1 line of TKI. We collected data about age, sex,
performance status, comorbidity, smoking status, histotype, metastatic sites, EGFR
status, treatment schedule, better response and time-to-progression (TTP) for each
line of treatment and overall survival (OS).
Results: 93 patients met selection criteria. Mean age 66,7 (range: 46–84). M/F
ratio is 3:1. 39 EGFR-WT and 54 EGFR-UK. All patients received erlotinib or gefitinib
as second-line treatment or erlotinib as third-line treatment. No TTP differences
were observed for both second-line (HR:0,91; p = 0,6333) and third-line (HR:1.1;
p = 0,6951) treatment (TKI vs CT). A trend of a benefit in OS in favor of 3rd-line TKI
(HR:0,68; p = 0,11).
Conclusions: This study explores the role of TKIs in EGFR non-mutated NSCLC
patients. OS analysis highlights a trend to a benefit in patients who received TKI in
third-line, even if this result is statistically non-significant. Further analysis are needed
to find an explanation for this observation.

8%, and 4%, respectively. Targeted therapy became the
new standard of care in a subgroup of patients selected
according to their tumor molecular profile. Both epidermal

kinase inhibitors (TKI) are currently recommended as the

best treatment option for patients whose tumors harbor
EGFR sensitizing mutations or EML4-ALK translocations,
respectively, resulting in a significant improvement of
survival outcomes, which nearly doubled compared to
standard chemotherapy [1–4].
For the majority of NSCLC patients without a
targetable oncogene driver, platinum-based combinations,
including gemcitabine and pemetrexed/bevacizumab,
for squamous and non-squamous histology, respectively,
represent still the backbone. The advent of the continuum
maintenance strategy with pemetrexed or bevacizumab
has further improved the survival outcomes of patients
with adenocarcinoma histology, reaching a new plateau
of about 14–16 months [5–7], while fewer options remain
available for patients with squamous cell lung cancer.
Unfortunately all NSCLC patients develop acquired
resistance within 6–10 months of treatment, with only
20% and 8% of all diagnosed population being able to
tolerate second- and third-line therapy, respectively [8].
After several years of research, new drugs have
recently emerged as effective therapeutic options also
in pre-treated patients who have been characterized by
a particular poor prognosis and limited survival. The
addition of the anti-angiogenic agents Nintedanib or
Ramucirumab to docetaxel has shown a modest but
significant survival benefit in patients who progressed to
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy [9–14], leading
to the approval of both drugs in this setting of patients.
Immunotherapy, including anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1
monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), represents another
promising strategy, which shows a significant superiority
compared to standard chemotherapy in pre-treated NSCLC
patients [15–17], while ongoing studies are exploring its
potential application also in first-line setting.
However we are still far from their introduction into
clinical practice. Therefore the current treatment options
available in second-line treatment include docetaxel,
pemetrexed, and the EGFR-TKI erlotinib, which is the only
one approved also as third-line therapy, as highlighted by the
BR.21 study, first showing a clinical benefit of erlotinib over
placebo in a pre-treated and unselected NSCLC population
[18]. After this trial several studies included in two recent
meta-analyses compared erlotinib to standard secondline chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and pemetrexed,
showing conflicting results [19–27]. Most of such studies
included an unselected population with an unknown EGFR
status, showing no significant differences between the two
treatment arms in all patients’ outcomes [28]. However
also the results of the studies performed in EGFR wildtype (WT) patients are controversial [29, 30], suggesting a
potential survival benefit in favor of chemotherapy [31], but
highlighting the urgent need of direct comparisons between
TKI and chemotherapy in this setting of NSCLC patients.
We compared clinical outcomes of erlotinib and of singleagent chemotherapy in EGFR-WT or unknown NSCLC
patients who progressed to first-line platinum-chemotherapy.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In EGFR wild-type NSCLC the EGFR pathway is
activated, even though the excessive activity of kinase
domain as in the mutant EGFR receptor lacks. This
explains why EGFR driver mutations have an oncogenic
effect. The modestly activated non-mutated EGFR has
anyways a role in cancer promotion by the induction of
cell proliferation, apoptosis inhibition, angiogenesis,
cellular motility and invasiveness [32].
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the best
second-line treatment option in a real-life EGFR-WT or
unknown NSCLC population, trying to identify a preferred
sequence of treatment, considering at least two or three
lines of therapy and alternating respectively chemotherapy
and TKI. The results could help to understand the role of
EGFR-TKI in the sequence strategy. This information
could help decision making in light of the new options for
second-line treatment in EGFR-WT patients.

RESULTS
Patients characteristics
93 patients have met the criteria and have been
selected for the first evaluation. 69 were male while
24 female and the mean age at diagnosis was 66,7 (range
46–84). 39 EGFR-WT and 54 EGFR-UK. All patients
received a first-line chemotherapy and a TKI as secondor third-line treatment: 80 among them were treated
with a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, while 13
with single-agent chemotherapy. All patients received at
least one line of EGFR-TKI: 67 as second-line and 26
as third-line treatment after second-line chemotherapy.
Table 3 and Figure 3 summarize the main characteristics
of the 93 cases analyzed. Among patients treated with
TKI as second-line treatment, 13 received gefitinib and
54 erlotinib. Among patients treated with TKI as thirdline treatment all received erlotinib. The following
analyses were conducted comparing two defined groups
of patients: patients treated in sequence with two lines of
chemotherapy followed by TKI in the third (CT-CT-TKI)
and patients treated with first-line chemotherapy, TKI in
second and subsequent third-line chemotherapy (CT-TKICT). We evaluated TTP of the second-line and the thirdline treatment, and OS. For the comparison of these main
endpoints (TTP and OS) for the second-line treatment, we
included data even from patients treated with only two
lines of treatment (CT-TKI).

(TKI vs CT)
No statistically significant difference was found, in
terms of TTP, for EGFR-WT or EGFR-UK patients treated
with TKI or chemotherapy as second-line treatment:

overlap of the two strategies (TKI and CT): mTTP 2 vs

every day clinical practice. Although the best outcomes
are obtained from the use of TKIs as upfront treatment
in EGFR mutated patients, all the international guidelines
agree to recommend erlotinib as potential treatment option
even for EGFR-WT patients who progressed to first-line
platinum-chemotherapy [33]. Indeed a modest activation
of the EGFR signaling pathway has been demonstrated
also in EGFR-WT NSCLC, promoting cancer cells
proliferation, motility and invasiveness, stimulating
tumor angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis processes
[32, 34]. Additionally several phase II studies have shown
encouraging activity and survival outcomes of erlotinib as
second/third-line treatment in EGFR-WT NSCLC patients
[35–37], whereas the randomized phase III BR.21 study
demonstrated a significant benefit of erlotinib over placebo
in a pre-treated and unselected NSCLC population [18],
leading to its approval in such setting in 2004. A real-word
cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in NSCLC
patients who received erlotinib after prior chemotherapyregimens, suggesting it as a cost-effective treatment in this
setting of patients [38]. However it has not been clarified
yet the best allocation of EGFR-TKI (second- or third-line
setting) in the treatment strategy of such patients.
This study was intended for the assessment of the
efficacy of EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib) compared
to standard single-agent chemotherapy (docetaxel or
pemetrexed) as second- or third-line treatment in EGFRWT/UK NSCLC population. The aim was the finding of
support to identify a preferred sequence of treatment for
these patients. Overall the baseline patients’ characteristics
in the present study were similar to those reported in
other prospective randomized studies, including the high
percentage of both adenocarcinoma histology and good

Overall survival
For OS analysis we compared EGFR-WT and
EGFR-UK patients treated with TKI as second- (CT-TKI)
or third-line therapy (CT-CT-TKI) respectively. The results
showed a trend toward a benefit for patients in the thirdline TKI group: mOS 26 vs 15 months (third-line TKI vs
second-line TKI), HR: 0,68, 95% CI: 0,42–1,09; p = 0,11.
No statistical significance have been found (Figure 3).
Among patients treated with TKI as second-line treatment,
a consistent number of them (N = 40) were treated only
for two lines of therapy, showing lower survival (Table 3).
However in the survival comparison between patients
who have been treated with at least three lines of therapy
(CT-CT-TKI vs CT-CT-TKI), a statistically non-significant
trend has been also confirmed in favor of the TKI in the
third-line treatment (mOS 26 vs 18 months; HR: 0,7;
p = 0,21) (Figure 4 and Table 3).

DISCUSSION
This retrospective analysis has been carried out in
order to find confirmation of the rationale of EGFR-TKI
use for EGFR-WT and EGFR-UK NSCLC patients in

PS [18, 25, 39]. The results of our analyses showed the
substantial equality in terms of TTP of the two treatment
strategies (TKI vs CT) both in second- and in third-line
setting. Such data are opposite to the results from the most
recent published randomized trials, including TAILOR,
CTONG0806 and DELTA studies [25–27]. All of these ones
show a significant superior PFS in favor of chemotherapy
over TKI in EGFR-WT NSCLC patients who progressed
to first-line treatment. Such discordance could be explained
by the high percentage (58%) of patients with an unknown
EGFR mutational status included in our study. Another
possible explanation may entail the lower sensitivity of the
techniques used for the assessment of EGFR mutational

status in our study, compared to the advanced platforms
with higher sensitivity used in more recent trials (i.e. Sanger
Sequencing vs Next-Generation Sequencing, respectively).
As regards the OS analysis, our results suggest that
treatment with EGFR-TKI is not inferior to the standard
single-agent chemotherapy. Trends toward better OS were
observed with third-line EGFR-TKI in both the comparisons
(CT-TKI vs CT-CT-TKI and CT-TKI-CT vs CT-CT-TKI),
although such differences were not statistically significant.
According to other recently published randomized trials
[25, 26], such evidences suggest a potential superiority
of second-line chemotherapy over EGFR-TKI in NSCLC
patients with EGFR-WT/UK, which failed to reach a

statistical significance because of the effect of the treatment
cross-over on the outcomes. Furthermore we can affirm
that the potential OS benefit in favor of second-line CT
is not induced by the number of treatment lines, but it’s
likely related to the right sequence of drugs. Anyway the
significance of results in a retrospective analysis remains
uncertain. Indeed as a retrospective study, our work has
several limitations, primarily the small number of subjects
included as well as the high percentage of patients with an
unknown EGFR mutation status, which of course reduce
the reliability of our data. Analyzing our results we can
conclude that, as recommended by all the international
guidelines, both chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI are equal
treatment options for NSCLC patients who progressed
to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. However
for those patients with good PS who are fit to receive it,
chemotherapy could represent the preferred second-line
option, reserving EGFR-TKI as third-line therapy. Similarly
EGFR-TKI, thanks to its peculiar tolerability profile can
be considered as a valid alternative to chemotherapy for
those patients with a poor PS or other comorbidities, who
are unable to tolerate single-agent chemotherapy but are
eligible for a second-line treatment. Moreover the LUXLung 8 trial compared afatinib with erlotinib, as second-line
treatment for patients with advanced squamous NSCLC.
PFS and OS were improved by afatinib. So this irreversible
EGFR-TKI should be considered as an alternative option in
this setting [40].
Recently several studies investigated the potential
role of a “proteomic scoring” by mass spectrometry
analysis of serum to identify EGFR-WT patients most

likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI [41–43]. Recently a
phase III randomized study has shown that patients with
a “poor proteomic score” had inferior OS with EGFR-TKI
compared to chemotherapy [44]. Other studies evaluated
germline genetic polymorphisms as predictors of response
to EGFR-TKIs, showing that genetic polymorphisms of
EGFR and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathways
may be surrogate biomarkers of EGFR-TKI activity and
toxicity in NSCLC patients [45–48]. Such data suggest that
there is a high inter-patient variability likely related to their
pharmacogenetic heterogeneity. However such findings
have not been translated into clinical practice yet. Therefore
clinical criteria, including patient’s age, PS, comorbidities
and toxicities, remain still crucial in the choice of the best
second-line treatment, which should be individualized
according to every patient’s characteristics and preferences.

CONCLUSIONS
This study, far to draw any definitive conclusions, is a
report of real-life clinical practice, which aims to stimulate
the current open debate on the best treatment algorithm
in EGFR-WT NSCLC patients, highlighting the urgent
need for further studies on this topic. EGFR-TKI should
be considered as a treatment option after progression upon
progression to first-line treatment. Probably the advent of
new drugs recently approved in second-line setting will
lead to new treatment algorithms, but it is still far from
clinical practice. In this framework this study could support
the use of EGFR-TKI as third-line treatment option after
new second-line treatment regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

•	 EGFR mutated status;
•	 Treatment with TKI after the third-line treatment;
•	Interruption of any of the treatments before two
months from the beginning.

Objectives of the study
Primary objective of the study has been to determine
what is the most appropriate treatment between TKI and
chemotherapy in EGFR-WT (ascertained non-mutated
EGFR status) or EGFR-UK (unknown EGFR mutational
status) advanced NSCLC patients, after progression from a
first-line chemotherapy. The two second-line options would
be compared on the basis of efficacy data: time to progression
(TTP) and overall survival (OS). The same comparison
would be also carried out for the third-line treatment.
Secondary objective of the study was to evaluate
the influence of activity and effectiveness of the first-line
chemotherapy, and the activity and effectiveness of TKI as
second-line treatment. To address this objective we would
analyze the association between the first-line chemotherapy
responders and responders to the second-line treatment
with TKI. As “responders” we mean those patients that
have shown complete (CR), partial response (PR) or stable
disease (SD) lasting six months or more. Conversely “nonresponders” are those patients who have shown progressive
disease (PD) or SD ≤ 6 months. In addition, we would
evaluate the influence of the TTP to first-line chemotherapy
on the TTP to second-line treatment with TKI.

Data collection
Data would be collected from paper or electronic
databases after the obtainment of written informed consent
to cancer treatment and processing of personal data. The
following characteristics were evaluated for every single
patient.
Patient’s data: 1) sex; 2) age at diagnosis; 3) smoking
status; 4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance
Status (ECOG PS) at diagnosis; 5) Comorbidities. Disease’s
data: 1) histotype; 2) stage at diagnosis (IIIB or IV); 3)
sites of metastases; 4) EGFR mutational status (EGFR-WT
or EGFR-UK); 5) type of EGFR mutation. Treatments and
outcomes: 1) type of treatment (schedules and drugs); 2)
best objective responses (complete response (CR), partial
response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease
(PD), according to RECIST criteria); time-to-progression
(TTP), meant as the time in months from the beginning of
any treatment and progression; overall survival (OS) meant
as the time in months from the beginning of the treatments
and death or the last visit.

Study design

Statistical analysis

This study was carried out as a retrospective
analysis by data collected from medical records of
patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally
advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIB–IV) NSCLC and
treated for at least two lines of therapy and at least one
line of EGFR-TKI. We evaluated patients treated from
2005 to present in various cancer centers in Italy. Patients
with EGFR mutations were excluded and we selected
for the analysis only EGFR-WT and EGFR-UK patients
evaluating the second- and third-line treatment, after firstline chemotherapy.

The analyses were performed by MedCalc version
14.12.0. For the comparison of the effectiveness of CT
and TKI at second- and third-line for TTP and OS, we
performed the Kaplan-Meyer test with use of the logrank test to calculate median TTP (mTTP) and median
OS (mOS). For all statistical tests, a p < 0.05 has been
considered as statistically significant.
