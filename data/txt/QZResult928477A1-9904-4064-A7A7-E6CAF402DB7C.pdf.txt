Abstract

Author Manuscript

RAS-driven malignancies remain a major therapeutic challenge. The two-stage 7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) model of
mouse skin carcinogenesis has been used to study mechanisms of epithelial tumor development by
oncogenic Hras. We used mice with a HrasG12V knock-in allele to elucidate the early events after
Hras activation, and to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of farnesyltransferase (FTI)
inhibition. Treatment of Caggs-Cre/FR-HrasG12V mice with TPA alone was sufficient to trigger
papilloma development with shorter latency and a ~10-fold greater tumor burden than DMBA/
TPA-treated WT controls. HrasG12V allele copy number was increased in all papillomas induced
by TPA. DMBA/TPA treatment of HrasG12V knock-in mice induced an even greater incidence of
papillomas, which either harbored HrasG12V amplification, or developed a HrasQ61L mutation in
the second allele. Laser-capture microdissection of normal skin, hyperplastic skin and papillomas
showed that amplification occurred only at the papilloma stage. HRAS mutant allelic imbalance
was also observed in human cancer cell lines, consistent with a requirement for augmented
oncogenic HRAS signaling for tumor development. The FTI SCH66336 blocks HRAS
farnesylation and delocalizes it from the plasma membrane. NRAS and KRAS are not affected as
they are alternatively prenylated. When tested in lines harboring HRAS, NRAS or KRAS mutations,
SCH66336 delocalized, inhibited signaling and preferentially inhibited growth only of HRASmutant lines. Treatment with SCH66336 also induced near-complete regression of papillomas of
TPA-treated HrasG12V knock-in mice. These data suggest that farnesyl transferase inhibitors
should be reevaluated as targeted agents for human HRAS-driven cancers, such as those of
bladder, thyroid and other epithelial lineages.

Introduction
Hras, KrasA, KrasB and Nras are plasma membrane GTPases that exist in an active, GTPbound, or inactive, GDP-bound, state. Many human tumors have a predilection for
mutations in one RAS gene family member. HRAS mutations are less common overall, but
they have a particularly high prevalence in cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, skin,
thyroid and urinary bladder. KRAS mutations predominate in pancreas, lung, and colorectal
malignancies, whereas NRAS mutations are found in melanomas and hematopoietic tumors
(1, 2).

Author Manuscript

Ras isoforms differ in their respective C-terminal hypervariable regions responsible for lipid
modification, subcellular localization, intracellular processing and trafficking (3–7). It is
clear that they have distinct functions, as knockout mice of each Ras gene display different
phenotypes (8–10). However, there is no definitive explanation for the predilection for
individual RAS oncogenes in different tumor lineages.

The two-stage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis has been extensively used for the study
of tumor initiation, promotion and progression. In 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)
-treated mouse skin, repeated topical applications of the tumor promoter 12-otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) triggers skin papilloma development and
progression into carcinomas. Mutant Hras alleles, mainly Q61L, are found in a high
proportion of benign papillomas initiated by DMBA (11, 12). Targeted deletion of the Hras
gene decreases the papilloma burden following a DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis protocol (13,
14), further establishing the importance of Hras in papilloma formation. These are often
accompanied by an increase in copy number of the mutant allele (15). However, it is not
clear whether Hras allelic imbalance is an obligate step in skin papilloma development. An
increase of the mutant-to-wild-type Hras allelic ratio has been implicated in progression
from squamous to spindle cell carcinomas (16). Loss of the wild-type Hras allele is also
seen in papillomas after chemical skin carcinogenesis, leading to the presumption that the
wild-type protein may function as a tumor suppressor. Recent data suggest that loss of the
wild-type Hras allele may promote tumor progression rather than initiation (14). Despite the
well-established role of Hras mutations in papilloma initiation in the skin 2-stage
carcinogenesis model, Schuhmacher et al reported that papillomas failed to develop after
topical administration of TPA to mice with an HrasG12V knock-in allele (17). In this paper
we revisit this question in an independently derived HrasG12V knock-in mouse model of
Costello’s syndrome that spontaneously developed papillomas (18), and exploit this system
to evaluate targeted therapeutics of Hras-driven tumors.
All Ras isoforms are farnesylated. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) block the addition
of an isoprenoid group to the C-terminal portion of Ras to prevent formation of active Ras.
FTIs block Hras farnesylation, membrane localization, and inhibit oncogenic Hras-driven
cellular transformation in vitro (19, 20) and in vivo (21). However, in most clinical trials

FTIs showed no significant antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors such as
lung, pancreatic and colon cancers, which mainly harbor KRAS mutations (22–24), or with
acute myeloid leukemia, which primarily have mutations of NRAS (25). The refractoriness
to FTIs of RAS-driven cancers has been attributed to compensatory
geranylgeranylprenylation of KRAS and NRAS, which preserves their membrane targeting
and function (26–28). However, the HRAS selectivity of FTIs versus K- or NRAS-driven
tumors has not been extensively studied in cells or in a mouse model, and no trial with an
FTI has been done exclusively in patients with HRAS mutant tumors.
The FTI class of anti-cancer drugs has gone into disfavor in part because of the failure of
clinical trials in patients that were not appropriately selected based on the oncogenic driver
of the tumor. The data provided in this study present a strong preclinical rationale for
revisiting the potential efficacy of FTIs in HRAS mutant tumors.

Results
HrasG12V is sufficient to initiate skin tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript

We treated the skin of Caggs-Cre/FR-HrasG12V mice, which have a knock-in HrasG12V
allele that is globally expressed at endogenous levels (18), with the tumor promoter TPA
only and examined them for tumor development. As shown in Fig 1, topical administration
of TPA alone to HrasG12V mice is sufficient to trigger rapid papilloma development. The
tumor latency is shorter and the incidence about 7-fold higher than in wild-type mice
subjected to sequential DMBA/TPA treatment. However, combined DMBA/TPA treatment
of HrasG12V mice resulted in about 1.8-fold more tumors than those treated with TPA alone,
indicating that DMBA cooperated with the endogenously activated mutant Hras allele in
tumor initiation. Histological examination at week 15 showed TPA-induced hyperplastic
changes in the epidermis and typical papillomas associated with increased Ki67 staining in
HrasG12V/ mice (Supplementary Fig 1). These observations indicate that oncogenic Hras is
a tumor initiator and that it is sufficient to trigger the skin neoplastic process.
Hras allelic imbalance is an obligate step in papilloma development and occurs only at the
papilloma stage

Author Manuscript

We previously reported that Hras gene copy number changes are almost always associated
with the development of spontaneously-arising skin and forestomach papillomas, as well as
angiosarcomas in HrasG12V mice (18). As shown in Fig 2A, 10/10 papillomas arising in
HrasG12V mice treated with TPA alone had increased copies of the mutant Hras allele. By
contrast, 7/10 randomly-selected papillomas induced by DMBA/TPA in HrasG12V mice had
increased copies of the HrasG12V allele, whereas the remaining 3 had acquired an HrasQ61L
mutation (Fig 2B,C), which was located in the second Hras allele (Supplementary Fig 2).
This helps to explain the greater tumor burden induced by DMBA/TPA in HrasG12V mice
compared to TPA alone (Fig 1). In DMBA/TPA-treated WT mice, 14/15 papillomas had
only an HrasQ61L mutation, as expected (See Table 1). To determine the stage of tumor
development at which Hras mutant allelic imbalance takes place we performed a PCR-based
analysis of laser-capture microdissected specimens of normal skin, hyperplastic skin and
papillomas from TPA-treated HrasG12V mice (Supplementary Fig 3). As shown in Fig 2D,

there was no gain in Hras mutant allele copy number in hyperplastic samples, whereas the
adjacent papillomas from the same animals had a higher number of HrasG12V alleles. Mutant
Hras copy gain was also associated with increased expression of mutant Hras mRNA
relative to wild-type (Supplementary Fig 4A and B). These data suggest that Hras-induced
tumor formation requires augmented oncogenic Hras signaling, either through increased
mutant Hras gene copy number or through acquisition of mutations in the second Hras
allele. This also applies to the human cancer cell lines harboring HRAS mutations that we
tested (Hth83, C643 and T24), all of which had two or more copies of mutant HRAS
(Supplementary Fig 5).
The farnesyl transferase inhibitor SCH 66336 preferentially inhibits growth of HRASmutant human cancer cell lines

Author Manuscript

Covalent lipid modification of G proteins is required for their membrane localization. All
RAS isoforms are farnesylated, whereas NRAS and KRAS, but not HRAS, are also weak
substrates for geranylgeranylprenyltransferase-1 (GGTase-1) (26–28). The disappointing
results of clinical trials with farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTI) are thought to be due at
least in part to the fact that they were tested in patients with KRAS or NRAS mutant cancers,
in which the oncoprotein could still be prenylated and hence remain functional. We tested
the effects of SCH 66336 on growth of 15 cell lines with different RAS mtations: 5 HRAS,
5°NRAS and 5 KRAS. As shown in Fig 3A, the 5 cancer cell lines with HRAS mutations
were sensitive to the compound, with IC50 ranging from 34 - 197nM. By contrast, the cell
lines with NRAS or KRAS were mostly resistant, with 6 of them having an IC50 > 600nM.
These differences in FTI-responsiveness of HRAS vs K- or NRAS lines were also reflected in
the growth curves (Fig 3B). Accordingly, SCH6636 also caused a profound inhibition of
DNA synthesis in HRAS, but not in KRAS or NRAS mutant cells (Fig 3C and Fig 3D).

HRAS-specific delocalization and inhibition of MAPK signaling by SCH 66336

Author Manuscript

We next investigated whether the HRAS-selective effects on cell growth were also
associated with corresponding effects on membrane targeting of the three RAS isoforms. As
shown in Fig. 4A, SCH 66336 delocalized only HRAS from the membrane compartment to
the cytosol of Hth83 cells, whereas KRAS and NRAS were unaffected. Treatment of Hth83
cells with SCH 66336 resulted in a time-dependent shift in migration of HRAS, which also
accumulated over time (Fig 4B). This was already apparent 6h after addition of the
compound, and peaked at about 48h. The timing of inhibition of pMEK closely paralleled
HRAS defarnesylation, whereas cleavage of PARP was only apparent when pMEK was
profoundly inhibited. We next performed dose-response studies of 4 HRAS and 4 KRAS or
NRAS mutant lines incubated with SCH 66336 for 72h. SCH 66336 abrogated MAPK
signaling, as determined by pMEK and pERK levels, in all 4 HRAS mutant lines in a dosedependent manner, whereas AKT signaling was not decreased (Fig 4C). Interestingly, there
was a paradoxical increase of pS473-AKT by the FTI in the HRAS-mutant Hth83 cells. This
is likely an off-target effect, since knockdown of HRAS in these cells by RNA interference
inhibited AKT phosphorylation at this site (Supplementary Figure 6B). SCH 66336 had no
effect on MAPK signaling in cells with KRAS or NRAS mutation, despite inhibiting the
farnesylation of wild-type HRAS (Fig 4D). Interestingly, although the NRAS mutant lines
Hth7 and Act1 were relatively sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of the compound

(IC50 of ~ 200 nM; Fig 3), SCH 66336 did not inhibit pMEK in these lines even at the
highest concentrations (1 μM). As Rheb GTPases are also farnesylated proteins, it is
conceivable that the growth inhibitory effect of SCH 66336 on these NRAS mutant lines was
exerted through their delocalization from endomembranes. This would be predicted to
decrease mTOR activity, which was not observed, based on no detectable effect on
phosphorylation of its substrate ribosomal S6. The mutant RAS dependency for signaling
and growth is further demonstrated in Supplementary Fig 6 and Supplementary Fig 7. Thus,
knock-down of mutant HRAS inhibited MAPK signaling and proliferation of Hth83 cells,
whereas depletion of WT KRAS or NRAS had no appreciable effect on signaling and only a
modest inhibitory effect on proliferation. Accordingly, in KRAS-mutant Cal62 cells and
NRAS mutant Hth7 cells, only the respective mutant knockdown inhibited cell signaling and
growth, whereas knockdown of the WT RAS isoforms was without effect on signaling and
only modestly inhibited cell growth.

SCH 66336 induces regression of papillomas in Hras G12V mice

Author Manuscript

We next tested the effects of SCH 66336 on papillomas arising in 8 – 12 week-old HrasG12V
mice treated with TPA for 12 to 16 weeks. Mice were continuously treated with topical
TPA, and randomized to vehicle or SCH66336 80mg/kg BID by gavage, and tumor growth
monitored every 2–3 days by caliper measurements. As shown in Fig 5A and 5B, treatment
of tumor-bearing mice with SCH 66336 induced an almost complete regression of the
papillomas within 10 days. By contrast, tumors from mice in the vehicle-treated group
continued to increase in size. Body weight was unchanged between both treatment groups.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that SCH66336-treated tumors had decreased Ki67
staining and lower pERK positivity (Fig 5C), consistent with the in vitro findings.
Hepatocytes are the only cell type exhibiting clearly increased downstream signaling
following endogenous expression of HrasG12V in vivo (18). As shown in Fig 5D, SCH
66336 inhibited Hras farnesylation and decreased pERK in HrasG12V mouse livers,
consistent with appropriate targeting of the drug in vivo.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our studies show that endogenous expression of mutant Hras is likely sufficient to initiate
skin tumorigenesis, as exposure of HrasG12V mice to TPA alone resulted in papilloma
development with shorter latency and greater tumor burden compared to DMBA/TPA
treated Hras-wt mice. These results differ from those of a prior study in an independentlyderived HrasG12V knock-in mouse model, in which topical administration of TPA failed to
induce papillomas (17). Although this could be due to a mouse strain effect, in our view it is
more likely that the co-expressed IRES-β-geo cassette included in the 3′UTR of the
HrasG12V targeting vector in the Schuhmacher study may have interfered with endogenous
expression of the oncoprotein, so that the required threshold for tumor initiation was not
achieved. This is also supported by the fact that the HrasG12V-IRES-β-geo mouse model had
an attenuated developmental phenotype compared to the one described here.
Tumor initiation can be achieved by activating mutations or copy gains of oncogenes. We
find that Hras-induced transformation is universally associated with copy gains of the

genomic locus containing the mutant allele, suggesting that Hras allelic imbalance is
obligate for tumor development. The evidence for this is quite compelling. Thus, 10/10
papillomas arising in HrasG12V mice treated with TPA alone had increased copies of the
mutant Hras allele. Moreover, all 10 randomly-selected papillomas induced by DMBA/TPA
in HrasG12V mice had either increased copies of HrasG12V or an acquired Q61L mutation in
the second Hras allele. All spontaneously arising skin papillomas, forestomach papillomas
and angiosarcomas arising in these mice also had HrasG12V amplification (18). Hras mutant
copy number increases have also been observed in DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas from
wild-type mice (15). We also found HRAS copy gains in 2/3 human cancer cell lines we
tested, with the other having a homozygous HRAS mutation, possibly due to uniparental
disomy at that locus. HRAS activating mutations are also associated with gene copy gains in
human Spitz nevi tumors (29) and human thyroid neoplasms (30). As might be predicted,
Hras mutant allelic imbalance was not present in normal skin or in hyperplastic specimens,
whereas it was consistently found in papilloma tissues. The association of oncogene
mutation and amplification is not uncommon. For instance, an increase in EGFR (31) or
KRAS (32) mutant allele copy number is seen in many non-small cell lung cancers.
However, mutant allelic imbalance is not required for transformation, as many NSCLCs
harboring these mutations have a single copy of the oncogene.

Author Manuscript

The role of wild-type Ras alleles in cell transformation is complex (33). On the one hand,
wild type Kras and Nras can act as tumor suppressors in cells with a corresponding mutant
Ras allele (34), an effect that has been shown to be dose-dependent (35, 36). Our results
suggest that loss of the wild-type Hras allele is not required for transformation of the skin
epithelium by mutant Hras, as only a minor subset of papillomas had loss of WT Hras in
HrasG12V knock in mice (18). Recent data from the Balmain lab is consistent with these
findings, as Hras heterozygosity appears to be primarily involved in malignant
transformation of skin tumors, rather than on tumor initiation (14). We found that WT-HRAS
alleles are present in most human cancer cell lines harboring HRAS mutations. Instead, our
results suggest that intensification of mutant Hras signaling through copy-number
imbalances may play a key, and possibly rate-limiting, role in papilloma initiation, as
supported by the fact that this imbalance is only seen at the papilloma stage. This was also
noted in Rat 1 fibroblasts harboring a single HrasG12V mutant allele introduced by
homologous recombination (37). Finney and Bishop found that endogenous HrasG12V
expression was not sufficient to induce Rat 1 fibroblast transformation in vitro, whereas
cells commonly had excess copies of the mutant Hras allele when transformed clones
developed after serial passaging.

Author Manuscript

We found that knockdown of Hras or Kras in cell lines expressing the corresponding mutant
oncoprotein markedly decreased basal MAPK signaling, whereas individual knockdown of
the wild type Ras isoforms did not. These data do not challenge the conclusions of recent
studies that point to an important supportive role of wild-type Ras in signaling activated by
oncogenic Ras (38–40), since we did not attempt to deplete all wild-type Ras isoforms.
Silencing of oncogenic Ras in three different RAS-mutant cell lines inhibited cell growth
more profoundly than depletion of each of the wild-type Ras isoforms, although the latter

also dampened cell growth to a modest extent, consistent with a cooperative role of wildtype Ras proteins in tumorigenesis (38–40).

Author Manuscript

All Ras isoforms (Hras, Kras and Nras) are farnesylated. Although ~30% of human cancers
harbor RAS mutations, the therapeutic efficacy of FTIs in the treatment of cancer patients
has been disappointing (22–25). We found that human cancer cell lines harboring HRAS
mutations are more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of the FTI SCH 66336 than those
carrying KRAS or NRAS mutations. Using FTI SCH 66336 across a panel of 5 different cell
lines from different tissues with HRAS mutation, the FTI reduced growth at IC50s ranging
from 34 – 197nM. By contrast, the cell lines with NRAS or KRAS were mostly resistant, with
six of them having an IC50 > 600nM (Fig. 3). Treatment of HrasG12V mice harboring
papillomas with SCH66336 resulted in profound tumor regression associated with inhibition
of Hras downstream signaling. Although this effect is likely exerted through inhibition of
Hras signaling in the transformed epithelial cells, we cannot exclude an effect of the FTI on
stromal cells or on the tumor vasculature, as the mutant allele is ubiquitously expressed.

The failure of clinical trials with FTIs can now be explained based on a better understanding
of their mechanism of action. Unlike HRAS, which is exclusively farnesylated, KRAS and
NRAS can be prenylated by geranylgeranyl transferases upon blockade of farnesylation, and
remain functional (27, 28). Consistent with this, we found that SCH 66336 delocalized
HRAS, but not KRAS or NRAS, from the membrane to the cytoplasm, and abrogated its
downstream signaling via MAPK. Clinical trials with FTIs did not consider this mutational
specificity in their criteria for selecting patients for enrolment. This was in part due to
preclinical studies that showed that some cell lines with KRAS or NRAS mutations, or even
cells that were wild-type for all RAS oncogenes, were variably growth inhibited by FTIs.
Bernhard et al showed that an FTI inhibitor, when used at concentrations that inhibited
farnesylation but not geranylgeranylation, increased the radiosensitivity of two HRAS
mutant lines but not two KRAS mutant cell lines (41). By contrast, Sepp-Lorenzino et al
noted that the effects of a peptidomimetic FTI were unrelated to the RAS mutation status of
the cells. In hindsight, this is not surprising as there were no HRAS mutant cell lines used in
their experiments (42). The FTI SCH 66336 was found to selectively delocalize HRAS and
induce G1/S arrest in cell lines expressing oncogenic HRAS, while showing inhibitory
effects on the G2-M transition and on anchorage-independent growth in cells with NRAS
mutation or that were wild type for RAS (43). These and other preclinical reports, and the
fact that KRAS and NRAS are mutated far more frequently in human cancers than HRAS,
may have led to these agents being tested in trials with patients selected irrespective of
tumor genotype. Hence, the clinical activity of these compounds has not yet been evaluated
in patients harboring the cancers that are most likely to respond.
A recent clinical trial with the FTI lonafarnib shows that benefits can be derived when the
patient population is selected based on a better understanding of the therapeutic target.
Children with the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome harbor a germline mutation in
LMNA which disables a proteolytic cleavage site in lamin A required to remove its
farnesylated C-terminus during its post-translational processing. Treatment with the FTI
lonafarnib showed improvement of vascular stiffness, bone structure and audiological status
in a significant fraction of these children (44). According to the COSMIC database, the

frequency of HRAS mutations is about 15 % in salivary tumors, 10% in tumors of the
urinary tract, 8% in tumors of the cervix and upper aerodigestive tract and about 4% in
prostate and thyroid cancers. In certain subtypes of thyroid cancer the prevalence of HRAS
mutation is particularly high, such as in sporadic medullary thyroid cancers (45, 46). Based
on all these considerations, we propose that FTIs should be reappraised in properly designed
clinical trials against their validated therapeutic targets.

FR-Hras G12V mice, which harbor a latent HrasG12V knock-in allele under the regulatory
control of its endogenous gene promoter, were crossed with Caggs-Cre mice to obtain
widespread endogenous expression levels of oncogenic Hras (18). Six to eight weeks old
mice were shaved before a single 25 μg dose of DMBA (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied to the
dorsal skin. A week later, TPA (12.5 μg, Sigma-Aldrich) was applied twice per week for 15
weeks. The farnesyl transferase inhibitor SCH 66336 (Merck) was dissolved in 20% (wt/vol)
2-hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin and administered to mice b.i.d by oral gavage at a dose of
80mg/kg. Skin tumors were monitored and recorded and measured twice per week for the
duration of the studies.
Tissue preparation, histopathology and immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. Normal and tumor tissue lysates were prepared for
extraction of RNA, DNA or protein as described (18). Histology was performed on H&Estained formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections. Antibodies used for IHC are listed in the
SI section. Animal care and all procedures were approved by the MSKCC Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Hras Allelic Imbalance Analysis
The genomic DNA from tissues was used as a template for PCR amplification with primers
that distinguish mutant (666 bp product due to insertion of loxp) from WT Hras alleles (622
bp). The primers and PCR conditions were previously described (18).
Laser-Capture Microdissection
Mouse skin was promptly excised after killing and immediately frozen with liquid N2.
Frozen sections (8 μm were used to microdissect skin epithelial cells of normal, hyperplastic
and papilloma tissues by laser capture using an Arcturus microdissection system. DNA was
extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN).

Author Manuscript

Average number of tumors per mouse during the time course of the study. There were five
groups of mice: HrasG12V mice treated with a single dose of DMBA followed by TPA
treatment twice per week (n=7), Hras G12V mice treated with TPA only (n=7), wild type
mice treated DMBA followed by TPA (n=7), Hras G12V mice treated with the vehicle
acetone (twice per week) (n=8) and FR-Hras mice (harboring the targeted Hras allele,
unrecombined, because of the absence of Caggs-Cre) treated with TPA (n=7).

A) PCR of genomic DNA of 10 papillomas or tails from TPA-treated HrasG12V mice with
primers that distinguish mutant from WT Hras alleles. W: wild-type 622 bp allele; M: 666bp
targeted allele. The mutant Hras allele copy number was increased in all 10 papillomas
induced by TPA alone. B) PCR of DNA from 10 randomly selected papillomas from
DMBA/TPA-treated HrasG12V mice, tails from HrasG12V mice and papillomas from
DMBA/TPA treated WT mice. 7/10 papillomas had M>W allelic imbalance. The three lanes
marked by an asterisk had ~ 1/1 ratio of M/W alleles. C) Representative Hras Sanger
sequence traces of PCR products of tumor DNAs from panel B: Left: Tumor with M>W
Hras allelic imbalance, showing the Hras G12V mutation, and a WT Hras Q61 codon.
Right: Tumor (*) without Hras allelic imbalance (M=W), harboring both Hras G12V and
Q61L mutations. G12V and Q61L are located in different alleles (Suppl Fig 2). D) Lasercapture microdissection (LCM) of normal skin epithelium, hyperplasia and papilloma. PCR

A) Western blots of subcellular fractions of Hth83 cells treated with 250nM SCH 66336 for
48hr, probed with the indicated antibodies. SCH 66336 delocalized HRAS, but not KRAS or
NRAS. C: Cytoplasmic; M: Membrane; N: Nucleus. B) SCH 66336 inhibits HRAS
signaling with a delayed time course in Hth83 cells. Hth83 cells were incubated with 250nM
SCH 66336 for the indicated time. The cell lysates were Western blotted with the indicated
antibodies. U: unfarnesylated HRAS; F: farnesylated HRAS. C) SCH 66336 blocked MAPK
signaling in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blots of 4 HRAS mutant cell lines
treated with the indicated concentration of SCH 66336 for 72hr probed with indicated
antibodies. D) SCH 66336 had no effect on MAPK signaling in cell lines with KRAS or
NRAS mutations, despite inhibiting farnesylation of WT HRAS in these lines.

Author Manuscript

A) Representative photos of mice after treatment with vehicle or SCH 66336 for the
indicated times. HrasG12Vmice were first treated with TPA for 12 to 16 weeks to induce
papilloma development. Mice then were treated with 80mg/kg SCH 66336 b.i.d. (n=5) or
vehicle (n=6) by gavage for the indicated times. B) Tumor volumes at the indicated times
during treatment with vehicle (n=10) or SCH 66336 (n=11) from the mice described above.
Tumor size was measured on days 0, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Bars represent mean ± SEM. C) SCH
66336 decreased cell proliferation and pERK in papillomas. Representative H&E and IHC
staining for Ki67 and pERK in sections of mouse papillomas treated with vehicle or SCH
66336. D) Western blot of liver tissues from HrasG12Vmice treated with vehicle (n=4) or
SCH 66336 (n=4), probed with the indicated antibodies. SCH 66336 decreased MAPK
signaling and inhibited Hras farnesylation in livers of HrasG12V mice.
