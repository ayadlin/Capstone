Growth of Pancreatic Cancer

Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exists in a complex desmoplastic microenvironment, which
includes cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts [also known as pancreatic stellate cells (PSC)] and immune cells that
provide a ﬁbrotic niche that impedes successful cancer therapy. We have found that mast cells are essential for
PDAC tumorigenesis. Whether mast cells contribute to the growth of PDAC and/or PSCs is unknown. Here, we
tested the hypothesis that mast cells contribute to the growth of PSCs and tumor cells, thus contributing to
PDAC development. Tumor cells promoted mast cell migration. Both tumor cells and PSCs stimulated mast
cell activation. Conversely, mast cell–derived interleukin (IL)-13 and tryptase stimulated PSC proliferation.
Treating tumor-bearing mice with agents that block mast cell migration and function depressed PDAC growth.
Our ﬁndings suggest that mast cells exacerbate the cellular and extracellular dynamics of the tumor microenvironment found in PDAC. Therefore, targeting mast cells may inhibit stromal formation and improve therapy.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States
(1), and from the perspective of cancer mortality it is one of the
deadliest diseases (2). With a 5-year relative survival rate of 6%
(3), PDAC has an extremely poor prognosis, which is related to
its inherent resistance to virtually all therapeutic modalities,
including conventional chemotherapy, treatment with targeted agents, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy (3–6).
Tumor cells do not exist in isolation during disease progression. The presence of an intense ﬁbro-inﬂammatory reaction, composed of immune cells (7) and cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts [also known as the pancreatic stellate cell (PSC);
refs. 8, 9], is a prominent pathologic feature of PDAC (10). These
components of the microenvironment provide a niche in which
pancreatic cancer cells can resist treatment. Essentially, the
robust desmoplastic response accompanies the progression
from normal histology to a malignant state in human pancreatic cancer (7) and promotes resistance by limiting the delivery
of chemotherapeutic agents (5, 9, 11, 12). The cells responsible

for the production of the desmoplastic reaction around pancreatic tumors are the PSCs (13).
Several investigators have reported that PSCs promote
tumor progression as well as chemoresistance (9, 13–15). PSCs
not only increase tumor cell viability in vitro, but they also
increase tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo (9, 14, 15). In
addition, PSCs produce secreted factors that render PDAC cells
more resistant to therapy (9). Despite these advancements,
many unanswered questions remain, particularly those relating to maintenance of the tumor ﬁbrotic microenvironment
during disease development.
Ehrlich (as reviewed by Ribatti and Crivellato, ref. 16) was the
ﬁrst to observe mast cell inﬁltration in chronic inﬂammation,
accompanied by a ﬁbrotic tissue response. Mast cells regulate
connective tissue turnover in wound healing, liver cirrhosis,
and pulmonary ﬁbrosis (17). Mast cells also regulate adaptive
immunity to tumors. Three recent reports indicate that
increased numbers of mast cells inﬁltrating into the PDAC
tumor microenvironment represent a poor prognostic indicator (18–20). Mast cell inﬁltration is zone speciﬁc in PDAC, and a
high mast cell count in the intratumoral border zone and the
distance to the tumor border is an independent risk factor for
decreased survival of patients with pancreatic cancer (18).
However, it is still unknown whether hindering the migration
of mast cells to the tumor site will dampen the aggressiveness
of PDAC and/or favor increased survival of tumor-bearing
hosts. The dynamic cellular interactions and complex interplay
between cell components in the human pancreatic cancer
microenvironment have not been well deﬁned. The precise
contribution of mast cells remains unknown.
In this study, we investigated the interactions among mast
cells, cancer cells, and PSCs. We found that pancreatic cancer
cells induce mast cell migration. Treating mast cells with
conditioned media from tumor cells and PSCs induced mast

cell activation. Conversely, mast cell–derived cytokines interleukin (IL)-13 and tryptase induced increased proliferation of
PSCs. IL-13 activated proliferation through the TGF-b2 pathway in a STAT6-independent manner. Blocking mast cell
migration and function in vivo suppressed PDAC growth and
improved survival of PDAC-bearing hosts. Our data suggest
that the dynamic cellular and extracellular interactions among
mast cells, tumor cells, and stellate cells contribute to the
desmoplasia found in pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human PDAC, Panc1, BxPC3, and AsPC-1 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). L3.6pl cells
were kindly provided by Dr. I.J. Fidler (The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Human PSCs were
isolated in primary culture from a surgical specimen of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and a stable cell line was generated by
immortalization (9). The PDAC and PSC cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
with penicillin and streptomycin (both from Invitrogen) at
37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2. The immortal
human pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) was provided as a generous gift from Dr. Ming-Sound Tsao (Ontario
Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada; refs. 21, 22) and was
cultured in keratinocyte-serum-free medium (SFM; Invitrogen). The human mast cell lines HMC-1 (kindly provided by Dr.
J.H. Butterﬁeld, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), and LAD2 (kindly
provided by Dr. A.S. Kirshenbaum, NIH, Bethesda, MD) were
cultured as described previously (23, 24). Cell lines were
validated by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA ﬁngerprinting
by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Characterized Cell
Line Core using the AmpF‘STR Identiﬁler Kit according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, cat. no.
4322288). The STR proﬁles were compared with known ATCC
ﬁngerprints (ATCC.org), to the Cell Line Integrated Molecular
Authentication database (CLIMA) version 0.1.200808 (http://
bioinformatics.istge.it/clima/; Nucleic Acids Research 37:
D925-D932 PMCID: PMC2686526), and to the MD Anderson
ﬁngerprint database. The STR proﬁles matched known DNA
ﬁngerprints or were unique.
Conditioned media preparation
Human PDAC, PSC, and HPDE cells were grown to 70% to
80% conﬂuence in complete culture media. The medium was
changed to serum-free RPMI-1640, and cells were cultured for
an additional 48 hours. The nonadherent HMC-1 and LAD2
cells (5  105/mL) were resuspended in serum-free RPMI-1640
and cultured for 48 hours. Medium was collected and ﬁltered
with 0.22-mm ﬁlters (Millipore).
Migration assay
The 8-mm pore Transwell polycarbonate membrane chambers (Corning) were used. A total of 5  104 HMC-1 or LAD2
cells in 500 mL SFM was added to the upper chamber.
Conditioned media from human PDAC, PSC, or HPDE cells
was added into the lower chamber. The cells were allowed to
migrate through the membrane for 24 hours at 37 C in 5%

3928

CO2 atmosphere. The nonmigrating cells on the upper surface
of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The
migrating cells in suspension in the lower chamber were
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde. No mast cells were found
adherent to the lower surface of the membrane after ﬁxation.
Migrating cells were collected, stained with hematoxylin, and
counted.
Cell proliferation assay
Proliferation of mast cells, pancreatic cancer cells, and
PSCs was assessed using Alamar Blue. Ten microliters of
sterile Alamar Blue was added per 5,000 cells. During the
incubation period, the conversion of the nonﬂuorescent
indicator dye (resazurin) to a bright red color (resoruﬁn)
by metabolically active cells was monitored by reading
absorbance at 570 and 600 nm. Proliferation was deﬁned
by calculating the percentage conversion of Alamar Blue, as
described previously (25).
Mast cell activation and ELISA
Supernatants from cultures of mast cells, mast cells cocultured with PDAC, or mast cells cocultured with PSCs (50:50 mix
of cells) were collected, and tryptase secretion was measured
by ELISA. Plates were coated with mouse anti-human tryptase
antibody (AbD Serotic) and samples were added. Alkaline
phosphatase–conjugated mouse anti-human tryptase antibody (Millipore) was used for detection. After adding the
substrate, the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. TNF-a
release was measured with a Human TNF-a Immunoassay kit
(R&D Systems).
Antibody neutralization
PSCs were cultured in mast cell conditioned medium with
the following neutralizing antibodies: (i) anti-human tryptase b-2/TPSB2 antibody [monoclonal mouse immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) clone #349414; R&D Systems; 4.2 mg/mL
equals 3 times the ND50]; and (ii) anti-human IL-13 antibody (monoclonal mouse IgG1 clone #32116; R&D Systems;
2.2 mg/mL equals 3 times the ND50; ref. 26). Mouse IgG1
isotype control (monoclonal mouse IgG1 clone #11711; R&D
Systems) was used at the same concentration of the neutralizing antibody. SFM was used as the positive control. Percentage suppression of proliferation ¼ (average proliferation
index of antibody blocking group  average proliferation
index of negative control group)/(average proliferation index
of positive control group  average proliferation index of
negative control group)  100%.
Dye eFluor 670 labeling and ﬂow cytometry analysis
PSCs were labeled with 5 mmol/L eFluor 670 (eBioscience; 10
min at 37 C) and 2  104 PSCs were added into each well of a
24-well plate. The cells were then cultured with medium only,
mast cell conditioned media, or 2  104 HMC-1. Upon 95%
conﬂuency (8 days), the cells were washed, resuspended in
PBS, and supplemented with 2% FBS. Upon cell proliferation,
the dye was equally diluted into daughter cells. Fluorescence
was measured with a LSRII ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Mast Cells Promote PDAC Tumor and Stellate Cell Growth

Western blotting
Lysates were prepared from PSCs. Samples containing 40 mg
protein per well were loaded in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were incubating in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry
milk/PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by an
overnight incubation at 4 C in the presence of antibodies
directed against TGF-b2 (R&D Systems), STAT6 (Cell Signaling
Technology), pSTAT (Millipore), pSmad2 (Millipore), b-actin
(Thermo Scientiﬁc), and b-tubulin (Epitomics). Membranes
were washed with PBS–0.1% Tween 20 and incubated in the
presence of horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody. Band detection was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Dura; Thermo-Fisher Scientiﬁc) and captured by X-ray ﬁlms. Blot quantiﬁcation
was conducted with NIH ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.
gov/nih-image/).
Orthotopic implantation of PDAC and AMD3100 or
cromolyn treatment
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
The mice were maintained in facilities approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International in accordance with current regulations
and standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and NIH. All animal
procedures were reviewed and approved by the MD Anderson
Cancer Center Animal Care and Use Committee. Orthotopic
implantation of PDAC was conducted as described previously
(27). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (via inhalation, 4% isoﬂurane in 96% O2), and a 1-cm incision in the left
subcostal region was made. Murine PDAC cells (Panc-02, or KrasG12Dp53/; refs. 5, 28) were injected into the caudal pancreas. The peritoneum and skin were closed with the EZ Clip
Wound Closing Kit (Stoelting Co.). Analgesia (buprenorphine;
0.5 mg/kg) was administered postoperatively to minimize pain.
Seven days after PDAC implantation, a group of the mice
received a CXCR4 chemokine receptor antagonist, AMD3100
(Sigma-Aldrich; 10 mg/mouse, intraperitoneal injection) every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 3 weeks, as described
previously (27). Another group of the mice received daily
injection of cromolyn (10 mg/kg body weight; ref. 29) into the
peritoneal cavity. PBS was used as a control. Twenty-eight days
after implantation, the mice were sacriﬁced, and tumor
volumes were estimated using the formula (p  long axis 
short axis  short axis)/6. Mast cell inﬁltration into the
pancreas was measured using Toluidine blue and analyzed
using ImageJ software (NIH) as described previously (27). To
determine the effect of AMD3100 on survival, drug treatment
continued and mice were sacriﬁced when they became moribund. In those experiments, we implanted C57BL/6 albino
mice with K-rasG12Dp53/ cells transfected with enhanced
ﬁreﬂy luciferase (30). At various times after tumor implantation, the mice were injected with D-luciferin (150 mg/mouse;
Caliper Life Sciences) and bioluminescence was measured with
the IVIS imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences). Tumor volume
was measured every week by imaging luciferase signals until
the endpoint was reached.

Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between control and experimental
groups was determined using the unpaired, two-tailed, Student
t test; a one-way ANOVA, followed by the Fisher least significant difference (LSD) multiple comparison test; or two-way
ANOVA (GraphPad Prism V4 and SPSS for Mac, Inc.). Survival
curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and
statistical signiﬁcance was determined using the log-rank test.
P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Representative experiments are shown; each experiment was
repeated independently at least 3 times.

Results
PDAC cells promote mast cell migration
Few mast cells can be found in the normal pancreas;
however, it has been reported that increased mast cell numbers
in tumor stroma represent a poor prognosis for patients with
pancreatic cancer (18–20). Therefore, we ﬁrst wanted to determine which cell in the tumor microenvironment promoted
mast cell migration. We cultured HMC-1 or LAD2 mast cells in
conditioned media derived from different pancreatic cancer
cells or nontumorigenic PSC or HPDE cells and measured
mast cell migration in vitro. The 4 pancreatic cancer cells that
we used represent different stages of human pancreatic cancer:
high (L3.6pl, AsPC-1) or low (Panc-1, BxPC-3) metastatic
potential; resistant (Panc-1, AsPC-1) or sensitive (BxPC-3,
L3.6pl) to gemcitabine chemotherapy. Compared with the
negative control (SFM), conditioned medium from all 4 different pancreatic cancer cell lines signiﬁcantly upregulated
mast cell migration (Fig. 1; P < 0.0001). On the other hand,
conditioned media from human nontumorigenic pancreatic
cell lines did not induce mast cell migration (PSCs vs. SFM,
HPDE vs. SFM; P > 0.05).
PDAC cells and PSCs stimulate mast cell activation
Next, we determined which elements within the tumor
microenvironment affect mast cell function. We asked if
coculturing tumor cells or stellate cells with mast cells would
result in mast cell activation. Two different human mast cell
lines were used, HMC-1 and LAD2. HMC-1 cells represent
immature mast cells, do not express the FceRI receptor, and
grow independent of stem cell factor (23). Cytokine (TNF-a)
release is a standard method to measure HMC-1 activation
(31). LAD2 cells represent mature mast cells with functional
FceRI receptors and are dependent upon stem cell factor for
growth (24). More than 98% of LAD2 cells are tryptase-positive,
and tryptase released to the culture supernatant is used as a
measure of LAD2 activation and degranulation (32). Using
these parameters, we tested the ability of human PDAC and
PSC cells to activate human mast cells. Compound 48/80 was
used as a positive control (33). A signiﬁcant increase in tryptase
release was observed when LAD2 cells were cocultured with all
the PDAC cell lines tested (P < 0.01 vs. mast cells cultured
alone). Similarly, culturing LAD2 with PSCs resulted in a small,
but signiﬁcant tryptase release [Fig. 2A; mast cells (MC) þ PSC
vs. MC only; P ¼ 0.001]. The activation of HMC-1 cells is shown
in Fig. 2B. Here again, coculturing the mast cells with the PDAC
cell lines or PSCs resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in TNF-a

release (P < 0.001). Our results indicate that both PDAC and
PSC cells trigger mast cell activation.
Conditioned media from mast cells stimulate PDAC
proliferation
To investigate the potential role of mast cells in driving
tumor growth, we cultured PDAC in mast cell conditioned
medium (Fig. 3). Compared with the serum-free controls, mast
cell conditioned medium increased proliferation of all 4 of the
pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A, Panc-1, 13.6% of total
increment; Fig. 3B, BxPC-3, 12.4% of total increment; Fig. 3C,
L3.6pl, 18.9% of total increment; and Fig 3D, AsPC-1, 16.5% of
total increment).
Mast cells promote PSC proliferation
Mast cell inﬂux and ﬁbrosis coexist in chronic inﬂammation (17), suggesting that there may be a role for mast cells
in ﬁbrosis of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we tested the

3930

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

hypothesis that mast cells affect PSC proliferation. When
PSCs were cultured with conditioned medium from mast
cells, PSC proliferation increased (Fig. 4A; 14.7% of total
increment).
We then measured, by ﬂow cytometry, the doubling times of
eFluor 670 dye–labeled PSCs cultured in control medium or
mast cell conditioned medium or PSCs cocultured with mast
cells. We found that the doubling time of PSCs was decreased
when the cells were grown in mast cell conditioned medium
(24.15  0.06 hours), compared with the control (25.04  0.22
hours; Fig. 4B and C). Strikingly, the doubling time of PSCs
cocultured with mast cells was even shorter (22.68  0.43
hours; Fig. 4B and C). Taken together, these results support our
hypothesis that mast cells promote desmoplastic response by
inducing PSC proliferation. It seems that both secreted mast
cell products and direct cell-to-cell contact are involved;
however, direct cell-to-cell contact provides the best stimulus
for PSC proliferation.

Mast cell–derived IL-13 promotes PSC proliferation
IL-13, a mast cell–derived T-helper cell 2 (TH2)-type
cytokine (34), is a major inducer of organ ﬁbrosis. It has
been identiﬁed as a dominant ﬁbroproliferative cytokine in
liver ﬁbrosis induced by schistosomiasis as well as in pulmonary ﬁbrosis caused by asthma via allergic mechanisms
(35–37). To determine whether mast cell IL-13 promotes PSC
proliferation, we treated mast cell conditioned medium with
neutralizing anti-IL-13 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, neutralizing IL-13 activity suppressed the PSC proliferation
(51.53% of blocking rate; P ¼ 0.0015), compared with the
positive control (IgG1).
We next investigated if the increase in proliferation in PSCs
is due to activation of the downstream effectors of IL-13. Stat6
phosphorylation is the latent cytoplasmic event that plays a
central role in IL-13–regulated signal transduction and gene
expression (38). IL-13 regulation of the TGF-b and phosphorSmad2 (39) pathway was recently reported to play a role in
ﬁbrosis (40, 41). We hypothesized that IL-13 promotes PSC
proliferation by regulating Stat6 phosphorylation or TGFb–pSmad2 pathway. To examine this hypothesis, we evaluated
Stat6, phosphorylated Stat6, TGF-b, and pSmad2 expression by
Western blotting. Stat6 and phosphorylated Stat6 (Supplemen-

tary Fig. S1) expression levels in PSCs were not affected by
either mast cell conditioned media or IL-13 antibody blocking.
However, TGF-b2, as well as pSmad2, in PSCs (Fig. 5C and
D) were upregulated in mast cell conditioned medium, and
TGF-b2 expression and Smad2 phosphorylation were modulated by anti-IL-13 antibody. Therefore, we suggest that IL-13
increases PSC proliferation by enhancing TGF-b2 production
and Smad2 activation, which is independent of Stat6 or its
phosphorylation.
Mast cell–derived tryptase promotes PSC proliferation
Tryptases are serine proteases implicated in asthma and
other inﬂammatory disorders and are highly expressed in
human mast cells (42, 43). Tryptase, a potent mitogen for
ﬁbroblasts, has been recognized as a molecular link between
mast cell activation and ﬁbrosis (44). A recent study showed
the importance of tryptase for inducing a cardiac myoﬁbroblastic phenotype, ultimately leading to the development of
cardiac ﬁbrosis (45). We hypothesized that tryptase inﬂuences
PSC proliferation, which is essential to the ﬁbrotic tumor
microenvironment. Adding anti-tryptase antibody to mast cell
conditioned medium suppressed PSC proliferation (38.06% of
blocking rate; P ¼ 0.0032; Fig. 5).

Blocking mast cell migration to the tumor
microenvironment suppresses PDAC growth and
promotes increased survival in vivo
Given the fact that PDAC development was suppressed in
genetically mast cell–deﬁcient mice (20), we explored pharmacologic approaches to verify that blocking mast cell
function can achieve the same effects on PDAC development. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that mediates mast
cell migration to its ligand, CXCL12 (46). The CXCR4 antagonist (47), AMD3100, blocks mast cell migration in vivo (27).
To determine if blocking mast cell migration to the tumor
microenvironment affects tumor growth in vivo, we tested
the effect of AMD3100 using an orthotopic model of PDAC.
Treating tumor-bearing mice with AMD3100 suppressed
tumor volume by 50% [286.6  45.3 mm3 vs. 574.9  66.2
mm3 (Fig. 6A; P < 0.005; AMD3100 vs. placebo control] and
increased survival (Fig. 6B; P < 0.0142; AMD3100 vs. placebo
control). Decreased tumor size and increased survival were
associated with decreased mast cell migration into the
tumor site (Fig. 6C–E). Collectively, the data indicate that
tumor cells activate mast cell migration to the pancreas, and
that blocking mast cell migration in vivo suppressed PDAC
growth and increased the survival of the tumor-bearing
hosts.

Blocking mast cell degranulation results in therapeutic
responses to PDAC in vivo
To determine whether targeting mast cell function has a
therapeutic effect in PDAC, we injected tumor-bearing
C57BL/6 mice with cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer. The
growth of surgically implanted K-rasG12Dp53/ tumors was
signiﬁcantly suppressed by cromolyn treatment (Fig. 7A–E;
P < 0.001; treated mice vs. saline control at day 42 after
treatment). Tumor measurement was conducted at the
endtime point (day 50) after treatment. The mean tumor
sizes in the saline- and cromolyn-treated groups were 31.3
and 5.2 mm3, respectively. A P value of 0.017 was determined
using Student t test. Similarly, mast cell degranulation in the
tumor microenvironment was inhibited in the cromolyntreated group compared with the saline-treated control
group (Fig. 7A–E). The growth of Panc-02 tumor cells was
also signiﬁcantly suppressed by cromolyn treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2; P < 0.001; treated mice vs. saline control

articles have shown a critical role for mast cells in PDAC (18–
20). In this study, we measured the interactions among mast
cells, tumor cells, and PSCs to determine how these 3 different
elements of the tumor microenvironment contribute to the
growth of pancreatic cancer. We found that tumor cells recruit
mast cells to the tumor site and stimulate mast cell activation
and that blocking mast cell function in vivo suppresses tumor
growth and increases survival. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst effective example that targeting mast cells in the tumor
microenvironment in the immunocompetent PDAC tumorbearing host can block tumor growth and promote increased
survival. Conversely, mast cells stimulate the proliferation of
PDAC and PSC cells. We suggest that the cross-talk between
mast cells, tumor cells, and stellate cells promotes mast cell
migration and activation, promotes cancer growth, and may
contribute to the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment that
promotes PDAC tumorigenesis.
We found that both the PDAC and PSC cells can trigger
mast cell activation and cytokine release. Conversely, mast cell
activation favors tumor cell proliferation, suggesting a feedback loop in the tumor microenvironment. Strouch and colleagues (19) reported that mast cells induced the proliferation
of 2 gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell lines (Panc-1 and AsPC-1).
Our results conﬁrm this observation and expand the concept
to the most representative PDAC cells, including the gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC cell lines (BxPC-3 and L3.6pl). Thus, mast
cells stimulate PDAC proliferation regardless of the metastatic
potential or drug resistance of the cell line in question.
More importantly, we identiﬁed a central role for mast cells
in promoting PSC proliferation. Although mast cell conditioned medium stimulated a signiﬁcant increase in PSC proliferation, the effect was minimal. This may reﬂect the culture
conditions used in this experiment, in which SFM was used.
Because we used SFM in the migration experiments shown
in Figs. 1 and 2, we wanted to keep the conditions in each
experiment as similar as possible. On the other hand, the

3934

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

maximal effect was found when culture conditions allowed
for direct contact of mast cells and PSCs. Mixed culture of mast
cells and PSCs led to a much shorter doubling time of PSCs
than observed when PSCs were treated with mast cell conditioned medium. This may suggest that in vivo, direct contact
between mast cells and PSCs is required to see the maximal
increase in PSC proliferation.
In many different tissues and organs and in a variety of
benign and malignant diseases (48), mast cell aggregates are
accompanied by ﬁbrosis (49). However, despite the frequent
occurrence and severity of the ﬁbrosis, little is known about a
cause and effect relationship, and this is particularly true in
pancreatic cancer. Our ﬁndings indicate that activated mast
cells secrete IL-13 and tryptase, which accelerates cancerassociated ﬁbroblast proliferation. This suggests that mast
cell inﬁltration and activation in pancreatic cancer contributes
to the dense ﬁbrotic stromal formation that is so prevalent in
this disease. With regard to the mechanism of IL-13 in PSC
proliferation, we tested a panel of extracellular matrix–related
factors, including TGF-b1, TGF-b3, TGF-a, TNF-a, IL-8, stromal cell–derived factor-1 (CXCL12), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and hyaluronic acid. We found that mast cell–derived IL-13 enhanced
TGF-b2 production and Smad2 phosphorylation without regulating Stat6 expression or phosphorylation. This was not
totally unexpected, as TGF-b2 has been known to induce
extracellular matrix formation (50). This growth-stimulating
effect of mast cell–derived IL-13 on stellate cells might lead
to the ﬁbrogenesis of pancreatic cancer. None of the other
factors mentioned earlier in this report were upregulated by
mast cell–derived IL-13 in our study.
Of course, the following must be taken into account in
interpreting the data presented here. First, our in vitro ﬁndings
are limited in that only immortalized human tumor cell lines
and nontumorigenic cell lines rather than ex vivo primary cells
were used here. This in part is due to the difﬁculty in isolating

Mast Cells Promote PDAC Tumor and Stellate Cell Growth

primary tumor cells. Second, our antibody neutralization
studies indicated a role for IL-13 and tryptase in inducing
stellate cell proliferation. Antibodies to a whole panel of
secreted mast cell products were included in these studies,
including TSLP, TSLP receptor, IL-1b, IL-10, and CXCL12;
however, only neutralizing tryptase and IL-13 had any effect
on PSC proliferation. Also, although we noted a signiﬁcant
reduction in PSC proliferation in the presence of anti-tryptase
and/or anti-IL-13, we were not able to reduce PSC proliferation
to background levels. This suggests as yet unidentiﬁed component(s) in mast cell conditioned medium may be playing a
role. Third, although the in vivo data presented in Figs. 6 and 7
indicate that both AMD3100 and cromolyn affect mast cell
migration into and function in the tumor site, it is important to
keep in mind that these agents can affect other cells in the
pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Cromolyn has been
shown to bind to S100P on pancreatic cancer cells, which
prevents the activation of RAGE, thus inhibiting tumor growth
and invasion (51). Cromolyn has also been shown to block
angiogenesis (52). However, in our analysis, angiogenesis was
not affected by cromolyn. We found that cromolyn treatment
did not affect the density of CD31-labeled vessels in the tumor
microenvironment (data not shown). AMD3100, a CXCR4
antagonist, was used here because it interferes with the in
vivo migration of mast cells (27). Others have shown, however,
that AMD3100 also prevented the noncanonical activation of
the sonic hedgehog pathway and the induction of epithelial–
mesenchymal transition in vitro (53). It is also important to
note that both cromolyn and AMD3100 have been shown by
others to downregulate the expression of TGF-b (54, 55). On the
basis of our observation that mast cell–derived IL-13 upregulation of TGF-b plays a role in the proliferation of stellate cells
(Fig. 5), it is entirely possible that both cromolyn and AMD3100
may be playing a similar role here. Regardless of the exact
mechanism by which cromolyn and AMD3100 affect pancreatic cancer development, our ﬁndings indicate an additional
function for these drugs in the tumor microenvironment:
inhibition of mast cell migration and function.
In summary, based on our in vitro and in vivo data, we suggest
a new paradigm for how mast cells promote the desmoplastic
response that favors PDAC development. Initial mast cell
migration was initiated by pancreatic cancer cells, not the
stroma or benign cells. Pancreatic cancer cells and stromal
cells activated the tumor-inﬁltrating mast cells as evidenced by
degranulation (tryptase release) and cytokine release. Degranulation and secretion of the cytokines from mast cells produced
a nourishing microenvironment that triggered a feed-forward
loop favoring cancer development. As a result, active mast cells

stimulated pancreatic cancer and stromal cell proliferation.
The presence of mast cells and their cytokines, including IL-13
and tryptase, in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic
cancer leads to stromal cell proliferation with TGF-b2 production and Smad2 phosphorylation, which eventually culminates
in tumor progression. Blocking mast cell migration with the
CXCR4-antagonist AMD3100 or inhibiting mast cell degranulation with cromolyn disrupted the feedback loop to a certain
extent. This ﬁnding may help to explain the signiﬁcant tumor
shrinkage in cromolyn-treated tumor-bearing hosts and longer
survival in AMD3100-treated tumor-bearing hosts, which suggests that blocking mast cell function to the tumor microenvironment may be a critical step to interrupt the positive
feedback loop of mast cell promoting PDAC progression. The
ﬁndings reported here provide proof of principal that mast cells
contribute to the desmoplastic microenvironment found in
PDAC by promoting the proliferation of PSCs. Therefore,
treatments targeting mast cell function may be one way to
overcome stromal formation and improve PDAC therapy.
