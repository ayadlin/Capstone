ABSTRACT
The combination of time and order-dependent chemotherapeutic strategies has
demonstrated enhanced efficacy in killing cancer cells while minimizing adverse
effects. However, the precise mechanism remains elusive. Our results showed that
pre-treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib or lapatinib significantly enhanced the
cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging agents compared to coadministration of the EGFR
inhibitor and DNA-damaging agent. Sequential application of erlotinib and doxorubicin
increased activated caspase-8 by promoting pro-caspase-8 homodimerization and
autocatalytical cleavage, whereas coadministration did not. We found that EGFR
inhibitors promoted pro-caspase-8 homodimerization by inhibiting ERK pathway
signaling, while doxorubicin promoted it. Our data highlight that ERK has the potential
to inhibit the formation of pro-caspase-8 homodimers by phosphorylating procaspase-8 at S387. In conclusion, the pretreatment of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
promote pro-caspase-8 dimerization that sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging
agents. Our findings provide rationale for novel strategies for the implementation of
combined targeted and cytotoxic chemotherapy within a new framework of time and
order-dependent therapy.

INTRODUCTION

above pathways is a potentially catastrophic event for
the cell and remains one of the mechanisms by which a
malignant cell can kill itself in the presence of a drug [7].
A better understanding of the mechanisms by which anticancer drugs exert such effects is essential to improving
the efficacy of combination therapies and limiting the
likelihood of resistance development. Doxorubicin (DOX)
is a major anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent used
in the treatment of breast cancer despite dose-limiting
adverse effects, such as cardiotoxicity, and the potential
for facilitating the development of multidrug resistance [8,
9]. To address these limitations and improve its efficacy,

Over the past decades, several important,
physiologic mechanisms of cell death have been described:
(1) Apoptosis, a mechanism of programmed cellular death,
involves two major pathways: the ‘extrinsic’ and ‘intrinsic’
pathway [1, 2]; (2) Autophagy, is known as a nonapoptotic model of cell suicide but the details regarding
its underlying process remain controversial [3, 4]; (3)
Necroptosis, like apoptosis and autophagy, is controlled
by a regulated program but characterized microscopically
by a necrotic phenotype [5, 6]. Activation of any of the

DOX is often supplemented by combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents [10]. However, this genotoxic
combination induces the intrinsic apoptosis pathway
through DNA damage additionally [11, 12]. Thus, the
combined use of chemotherapies with similar mechanisms
of action has limited efficacy and can potentially facilitate
the development of drug resistance.
Novel targeted therapies have shown considerable
clinical efficacy with improvements in overall survival
across a spectrum of human cancers [13-15]. The potential
efficacy of a novel, combined therapeutic strategy utilizing
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) alongside cytotoxic
chemotherapy has previously been explored in the
treatment of breast cancer. However, EGFR inhibition in
combination with genotoxic agents such as cisplatin have
resulted in less than a 10% survival benefit [16]. Moreover,
the addition of EGFR inhibitor cetuximab to carboplatin
did not improve outcomes in a randomized phase II trial in
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients [17]. While
these results are far from encouraging, experimental data
indicate that time-staggered EGFR inhibition, as opposed
to simultaneous co-administration, can dramatically
sensitize a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cells
to genotoxic drugs [18]. The same phenomenon has also
been demonstrated in non-small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC). In four randomized phase III trials [19, 20],
while concurrent administration of erlotinib or gefitinib
with standard platinum-doublet chemotherapy did not
improve survival compared with chemotherapy alone, the
sequential, staggered scheduling of erlotinib followed by
cytotoxic chemotherapy led to a significant improvement
in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
advanced NSCLC, in the multicenter, randomized phase
II First-Line Asian Sequential Tarceva and Chemotherapy
Trial (FAST-ACT) [21]. Pre-clinical evidence indicates a
potential antagonism that exists between the constituents
of such combination therapies when they are administered
simultaneously [22]. On the other hand, the molecular
mechanism underlying the efficacy of sequential coadministration has not been elucidated.
It has been shown that erlotinib-dependent
caspase-8 activation occurs following DNA damage,
which activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but the
underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive [18].
Caspase-8 activation through dimerization is known to
recruit oligomeric activation platforms that assemble
subsequent to activation of the extrinsic pathway [23-25].
It is also well-established that caspase-8 phosphorylation
induces the formation of a stable, inactive cytosolic dimer,
and this hypothesis has been proven through Lyn induced
pro-caspase-8 phosphorylation and dimerization [26].
The aim of our work was to identify cytosolic proteins
affected by EGFR inhibition that promote caspase-8
activation in a breast cancer model. We found that
procaspase-8 activation was induced by EGFR inhibitors,
with subsequent activation of the downstream caspasewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dependent pathways, including both the extrinsic and the
intrinsic apoptotic cascades. Our findings demonstrate
a potential mechanism underlying the efficacy of
sequential scheduling of combined TKIs and genotoxic
chemotherapy administration.

RESULTS
Sequentially application of EGFR inhibitor
followed by doxorubicin mediated cell death
The growth inhibition of the EGFR inhibitors
erlotinib and lapatinib in the breast cancer MCF-7 cells
was examined. Surprisingly, both erlotinib and lapatinib
did not yield an apparent effect on MCF-7 cell viability,
even at 10 μM concentration and 48 h incubation (Figure
1A and 1B). This negligible inhibition indicates that
MCF-7 cells exhibit strong resistance to EGFR inhibition.
To improve the growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells, the
time-staggered administration of EGFR inhibitors
was conducted followed by DNA intercalating agent
doxorubicin, which has been reported to dramatically
inhibit a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cells.
We found that 10μM doxorubicin could reduce cell
proliferation by 30-50% (Figure 1C and 1D). Simultaneous
co-administration showed no difference compared to
doxorubicin alone. Interestingly, however, combinations
in which EGFR inhibitors were administered 24 h prior to
doxorubicin demonstrated a markedly enhanced inhibition
of proliferation, with an inhibitory rate of 70-90%. When
the order of drug presentation was reversed— doxorubicin
given before erlotinib – cell killing was not enhanced
relative to treatment with doxorubicin alone (Figure 1C
and 1D). We next studied cell death responses to the
combination of erlotinib and doxorubicin by AnnexinVPI staining (Figure 1G). Consistent with the MTT assays,
time and order-dependent combination of erlotinib and
doxorubicin led to a markedly enchanced apoptotic rate.
Our results are consistent with a prior study by Lee et al.
[18].
Although EGFR is overexpressed in MDA-MB-468
cells, they were also insensitive to EGFR inhibition. To
verify and validate the efficacy of the order and timing
of drug administration in this model, the potential for
synergistic killing was also explored following timestaggered pre-treatment with either erlotinib or lapatinib in
combination with doxorubicin. As expected, pre-treatment
with EGFR inhibitors could also sensitize the MDAMB-468 cells to doxorubicin (Figure 1E and 1F).

Sensitization to doxorubicin-induced cell death

Activation of the NF-κB family of transcription factors is
known to mediate cellular responses to DNA-damaging
therapies; however, there was no apparent difference in
the activation of the NF-κB pathway between these two
groups (Figure 2A). As DNA damaging agents commonly
induce apoptosis through activation of caspase-9,
key mediator of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, we
investigated the role of caspase-9 in the sequential,

We next sought to identify the molecular basis for
the observed difference in therapeutic efficacy between
simultaneous co-administration versus sequential dosing.

combined administration of erlotinib and doxorubicin.
Interestingly, although silencing of caspase-9 by siRNA
reduced the inhibitory rate of both simultaneous and
sequential co-administration, the staggered, sequential
treatment strategy was still effective (Figure 2B). Then
the extrinsic apoptotic pathways were analyzed. The
results of Western blotting revealed that pre-treatment with
erlotinib followed by doxorubicin markedly increased
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells compared with simultaneous
co-administration, as evidenced by higher levels in
cleaved PARP after sequential treatment (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, levels of the activated form of caspase-8,
intermediate fragments p43/p41 and p18, were also
increased in sequential dosing (Figure 2D). Based on these
findings, the role of the initiator caspase of the extrinsic
apoptotic pathways, caspase-8, was further investigated.
Treatment of MCF-7 cells with a pan-caspase inhibitor,
Z.VAD-FMK, significantly suppressed doxorubicin-

induced cell death and attenuated the difference between
simultaneous co-administration and sequential dosing
(Figure 2E left). To confirm the involvement of caspase-8
in erlotinib-mediated chemosensitization to doxorubicin,
MCF-7 cells with silencing of caspase-8 by siRNA was
preformed. Consistent with the result of Z.VAD-FMK
administration, silencing of caspase-8 also significantly
suppressed doxorubicin-induced cell death and attenuated
the difference between co-administration and sequential
dosing (Figure 2E right). These results indicated that
pre-treatment with erlotinib sensitized MCF-7 cells to
doxorubicin by inducing the caspase-8 mediated extrinsic
apoptotic pathway.

Erlotinib
promotes
homodimerization

pro-caspase-8

Erlotinib
induces
pro-caspase-8
homodimerization by inhibiting pERK 1/2

It is well known that activation of pro-caspase-8
results from its homodimerization. We asked whether
erlotinib may have an effect on the dimerization of procaspase-8 in MCF-7 cells. To investigate this issue, the
native-page was performed, and the band around the
130KD mark was regarded as a dimer of caspase-8,
which has been previously reported and validated. MCF7 cells were treated with either erlotinib or doxorubicin
respectively at indicated times. Interestingly, we
found that erlotinib increased levels of this caspase-8
dimer while doxorubicin reduced it (Figure 3A). To
demonstrate that this was indeed a homodimer, a homolog
of caspase-8, FLIP, which lacks a functional caspase
domain but can form a heterodimer with caspase-8, was
detected simultaneously. Indeed, FLIP was not detected
at the same position around 130KD, confirming that this
dimer was the homodimer of caspase-8. Furthermore,
we constitutively expressed FLAG-caspase-8 and HAcaspase-8 in MCF-7 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation
revealed that erlotinib increased the combination of Flagcaspase-8 and HA-caspase-8, which was consistent with
our native-page result (Figure 3B). Taken together, these
data indicate that pre-treatment with erlotinib sensitized
MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin by promoting pro-caspase-8
homodimerization and activity.

Dimerization plays a crucial role in the activity of
many kinases, including Raf, CDK2 (cyclin-dependent
kinase 2) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
[27]. However, dimerized conformational states are
often stabilized by the appropriate phosphorylation
of the appropriate residues. When pro-caspase-8
homodimerization and activity was investigated, Lyn
was demonstrated to phosphorylate pro-caspase-8 at
Tyr380, thereby inducing the formation of an inactive
pro-caspase-8 homodimer, while the mechanism inducing
the formation of an active pro-caspase-8 homodimer
was unknown. Previous reports have suggested that
caspase-8 can be phosphorylated at its S387 residue
and is a substrate of P-ERK [28]. Since P-ERK is a the
major downstream effector of the EGFR pathway, which
could also be downregulated by erlotinib-mediated EGFR
inhibition, we asked whether erlotinib could induce procaspase-8 homodimerization by attenuating pERK 1/2
mediated phosphorylation of pro-caspase-8 at S387. To
investigate this possibility, P-ERK was analyzed in MCF7 cells treated with either erlotinib or doxorubicin. As
expected, without impacting the level of ERK, erlotinib
downregulated P-ERK expression, while doxorubicin
upregulated its expression (Figure 4A). Based on these
findings, we hypothesized that ERK represents a key
molecule in the phenomenon of sequential dosing. Thus,
we replaced erlotinib with MEK inhibitors, AZD6244 and
U0126 , which have been reported to significantly reduce
P-ERK levels. We found that ERK inhibition was sufficient
to mimic the effects of erlotinib in sequential applications
of anti-cancer drugs, as pre-treatment with AZD6244 or

U0126 could also sensitize MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin
treatment (Figure 4B). Furthermore, compared with
negative controls, ERK knockdown by siRNA could also
sensitize MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin treatment (Figure
4C). These results provide further, adjunctive evidence
that pre-treatment with erlotinib sensitized MCF-7 cells
to doxorubicin by inhibiting downstream activation of
P-ERK.
To demonstrate that P-ERK reduces pro-caspase-8
homodimer, MCF-7 cells were treated with MEK
inhibitors and siRNA knockdown and pro-caspase-8
homodimer levels were measured. Our data indicated
that either MEK inhibition or siRNA knockdown could
increase levels of this dimer (Figure 4D).

5A and 5B). Moreover, the non-phosphorylatable
(S387A) caspase-8 attenuated the synergistic effects of
the sequential application of erlotinib and doxorubicin
compared to co-administration, suggesting that caspase-8
S387 plays a key role in the synergistic effects of
sequential administration of erlotinib and doxorubicin
(Figure 5A and 5B). These experiments allowed us to
conclude that P-ERK impaired caspase-8 activity in this
system.
Next, we examined whether phosphorylation at the
S387 residue by P-ERK modulates caspase-8 dimerization.
The native-page showed that MCF-7 cells with caspase-8
S387A did not increase or even reduced dimerization with
erlotinib or doxocubicin compared to the empty vector
control (Figure 5C). Further experiment showed that the
expression of caspase-8 S387A in MCF-7 cells eliminated
the difference of pro-caspase-8 autocatalytic activation
with doxorubicin alone, simultaneous co-administration
of erlotinib and doxorubin, as well as their sequential
administration. In addition, apoptosis was activated
equally among these three different treatment groups,
as cleaved PARP showed no apparent difference (Figure
5D). Apoptosis analysis by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining
showed that caspase-8 S387A in MCF-7 cells attenuated
the enhanced apoptotic effect facilitated by the sequential
application of erlotinib and doxorubicin (Figure 5E),

mutant significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell

In this study, we found that pre-treatment with erlotinib
followed by doxorubicin could lead to activation of
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is mediated by
caspase-8, while the simultaneous co-administration of
these two distinct classes of anti-cancer agents showed no
induction of extrinsic apoptosis. We hypothesize that the
synergistic therapeutic effect of sequential administration
of EGFR inhibitor followed by doxorubicin was related
to the co-induction of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
pathways.

in treatment response and chemoresistance has been
recognized [32]. The canonical MAPK signaling cascade,
depending on the extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(ERK), can provide a protective effect, thereby limiting
DNA damage [33]. P-ERK is known to protect cancer
cells from undergoing death receptor-mediated apoptosis
by phosphorylating pro-caspase-8 [28]. However, its
underlying molecular mechanism has not been previously
elucidated.
In this study, we provide evidence for a mechanism
underlying the synergy between pre-treatment with EGFR
inhibitors followed by DNA-damaging chemotherapy
application in breast cancer cell lines. Upon DNA damage,
cancer cells undergo defensive biological behavior tactics
that promote cell survival and facilitate DNA repair, for
instance, by activating several known survival pathways.
We found that treatment with doxorubicin resulted in
P-ERK activation and ultimately led to chemoresistance
in breast cancer cells. Activated ERK inhibited caspase8-induced apoptosis by preventing pro-caspase-8
homodimerization. Since EGFR inhibitors can reduce
P-ERK levels, DNA-damaging agents in simultaneous
combination with EGFR inhibitors should provide a
synergistic effect. However, the co-administration of
these two classes of anti-cancer agents shows no enhanced
efficacy over DNA-damaging agents alone. Interestingly,
our data demonstrate that pre-treatment with EGFR
inhibitors can sensitize breast cancer cells to DNAdamaging agents.
Our study showed that although ERK can be
inhibited through simultaneous co-administration of
these two kinds of anti-cancer agents, the formation of
pro-caspase-8 homodimer was not increased, whereas
pre-treatment with erlotinib could increase levels of this
critical dimer. Our data suggest that pre-treatment with
erlotinib can increase the pro-caspase-8 homodimer and
thereby sensitize cancer cells to strong apoptotic stimuli,
such as doxorubicin.
Ras family proteins are essential downstream
components of the EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling pathways
and Ras mutations are frequently detected in several
cancers [34], thereby limiting the clinical benefit of
EGFR inhibitors. In these Ras mutant cell lines, sequential
application of EGFR inhibitors and doxorubicin may
not demonstrate a superior, synergistic effect over their
concurrent co-administration. However, our experiments
suggest that replacing the EGFR inhibitors with more
downstream inhibition via MEK-targeted therapy may also
produce the same therapeutic effect.
In the past decades, therapeutic strategies for
cancer have begun to shift from the use of individual
agents to combined therapeutic regimens, and it is wellestablished that cytotoxic chemotherapies are most
effective and can produce synergistic effects when given
in combination. However, these strategies are limited by
the highly complex signaling networks that enable cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell populations to evolve towards drug-resistant clones.
Thus, identification of effective combinatorial therapeutic
strategies will be vital. Our study highlights one potential
synergistic mechanism underlying the superior efficacy of
sequential scheduling of TKIs and cytotoxic compounds
compared to concurrent co-administration and provides a
rationale for designing novel combination therapies.
