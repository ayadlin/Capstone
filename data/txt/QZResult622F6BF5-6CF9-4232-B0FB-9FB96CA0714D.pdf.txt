Development of Curcumin as an
Epigenetic Agent
Siqing Fu, MD, PhD and Razelle Kurzrock, MD

The clinical benefits of curcumin as a single agent were demonstrated in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in
a phase 2 study despite pharmacokinetic analysis showing a much lower plasma concentration of curcumin in
humans than in vitro. The diverse and broad biological activities of curcumin are mediated through direct interaction
of curcumin with target proteins as well as epigenetic modulation of target genes, supported by evidence that
curcumin modulates gene expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in human cancer cells. This
review delineates the novel mechanisms of curcumin as an epigenetic agent through its interaction with histone
deacetylases, histone acetyltransferases, DNA methyltransferase I, and microRNAs. Accumulating data support
curcumin’s functionality in modulating multiple biological processes at low concentrations through its activity as an
epigenetic agent. The development of curcumin as an epigenetic agent warrants further preclinical and clinical
studies to explore its diversity and efficacy in cancer treatment and in combination with other anticancer agents.

Curcumin as a single agent displayed clinical benefit in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer1 despite pharmacokinetic analysis showing its much lower plasma concentration in humans than in vitro. A possible explanation for its
activity in humans is that accumulation of curcumin and its metabolites in cells during daily exposure occurs because it is
its highly hydrophobic nature.2 Another explanation may be that curcumin exerts its biological activities through epigenetic modulation, which requires lower concentrations. This review summarizes the current data surrounding curcuminmediated epigenetic modulation and its role in anticancer treatment.
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a yellow hued polyphenol, is an active component of the perennial herb Curcuma
longa, commonly known as turmeric.2 The major components in the curcuminoid complex are curcumin (approximately
80%), demethoxycurcumin (approximately 17%), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (approximately 3%).3 Curcumin is
minimally soluble in water but quite soluble in organic solvents. Its enolic and beta diketone forms are stable in acidic pH,
but unstable in neutral and basic pH solutions, where they are degraded to ferulic acid and feruloylmethane. Curcumin is,
however, more stable in 10% fetal calf serum and human blood, with <20% of curcumin decompensation in the first
hour after administration.4
Curcumin has diverse molecular targets associated with numerous biochemical and molecular cascades with activity
exerted via direct interaction with and/or epigenetic modulation of gene expression. To date, curcumin has been found to
physically bind to as many as 33 different proteins, including thioredoxin reductase, COX2, protein kinase C, 5-lipoxygenase, and tubulin.5 The various molecular targets modulated by curcumin include transcriptional factors, growth factors
and their receptors, cytokines, enzymes, and genes regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.
Cancer epigenetics is characterized by heritable patterns of specific DNA methylation and chromatin modification.6
Epigenetic factors can also affect microRNA expression.7 Neoplasia is characterized by distinct patterns of disrupted
pathways involving genetic alterations and epigenetic changes mediated by DNA methyltransferases, methyl-CpGbinding domain proteins, histone acetyltransferase (HAT), histone deacetylase (HDAC), histone methyltransferases, and

histone demethylases, resulting in DNA global hypomethylation, and promoter-localized hypermethylation.8
Here we delineate the factors responsible for curcumin’s
promise as an epigenetic agent for cancer therapy drug
development.
Curcumin and Histone Deacetylases
At least 18 HDACs have been identified in humans,
primarily occupying 4 classes based on homology with
yeast deacetylases.9 HDAC enzymes do not bind to DNA
directly but rather interact with DNA through multiprotein complexes that include corepressors and
coactivators.
Among 33 carboxylic acid derivatives, curcumin was
the most effective HDAC inhibitor at 50 to 500 lM in
HeLa nuclear extracts at an IC50 of 115 lM. Molecular
docking studies performed for human HDAC8 showed
that curcumin has a free binding energy (8.55 DG kcal/
mol) and inhibition constant (Ki ¼ 539 nM) comparable
to Trichostatin A and vorinostat (8.59 and 7.65 DG
kcal/mol, and Ki ¼ 504 nM and 2.47 lM, respectively),
and that it is more potent than valproic acid and sodium
butyrate (4.41 and 4.65 DG kcal/mol, and Ki ¼ 564
and 365 lM, respectively). Analysis of curcumin’s
molecular docking in a complex with human HDAC8
revealed that the ligand adopted a stable binding conformation extended toward the entrance domain.10
One study showed that Raji cells, a cell line of
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes with surface
Fc receptors, treated with different concentrations of
curcumin for 0, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours inhibited
cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner
with an IC50 of 36 hours at 24 lM.11 Another study
revealed that the expression of HDAC1, 3, and 8 was
significantly higher in untreated Raji cells compared with
curcumin-treated cells, leading to significantly greater
levels of acetylated histone H4 in cells treated with 25 lM
of curcumin for 24 hours. Western blots showed that
HDAC1, 3, and 8 protein levels decreased in a dosedependent manner with curcumin exposure,12 but did
not show whether curcumin could directly inhibit HDAC
enzyme activity. Increased acetylated histone H4 was associated with decreased levels of HDAC1, 3, and 8 proteins.
Another study found that curcumin at nanomolar concentrations restored corticosteroid function in monocytes
exposed to oxidants by maintaining HDAC2 activity via
preventing oxidant-induced degradation of HDAC2
through down-regulating gene expression associated with
protein degradation.13 Although controversy exists about

Cancer

the ability of curcumin to inhibit HDAC enzymes, it
likely modulates HDAC activity through regulating gene
expression. Further research is required to validate this
hypothesis.
Curcumin and Histone Acetyltransferases
HATs including at least 25 members are organized into
4 families based on primary structure homology.14 The
disparate family of HATs, acetylates, histones, and nonhistone targets is involved in diverse processes such as
transcription activation, gene silencing, DNA repair, and
cell cycle progression.15
Recent enzymatic studies dealing with the p300
HAT domain support the existence of a Theorell-Chance
catalytic mechanism combined with broad substrate
specificity independent of a specific Asp/Glu general base
mechanism. Despite evidence that p300 acts as a tumor
suppressor, some studies showed that when p300 was
down-regulated and inhibited, tumor regression resulted,
along with activation of a senescence checkpoint, which is
logical given the finding that p300/CBP is important for
the G1/S cell cycle transition.16 This suggests that the role
of p300/CBP in cancer biology is versatile and contextdependent, supporting curcumin’s role as a specific
inhibitor of p300/CBP capable of inducing apoptosis in
cancer cells without producing cytotoxic effects in healthy
cells. Thus, p300/CBP HAT is an excellent target for
novel cancer treatment drug development.17
Curcumin has been identified as a specific inhibitor
of p300/CBP HAT activity in vitro and in vivo, but not
of p300/CBP-associated factor, a HAT that associates
with p300/CBP. Filter binding and gel HAT assays
showed that acetylation of histones H3 and H4 by p300/
CBP was strongly inhibited covalently by curcumin, with
an IC50 of approximately 25 lM, whereas p300/CBPassociated factor HAT activity did not change even in the
presence of 100 lM curcumin.18 These findings demonstrate curcumin’s high specificity for p300/CBP HAT
activity, but not for other enzymes that have histone substrates. The binding site on p300/CBP was specific for
curcumin, and binding led to a conformational change,
resulting in a decrease in the binding efficiency of histones
H3 and H4 and acetyl CoA.19 These findings are significant in cancer because of the complex role of HATs in
cancer, as is specifically explained later in this review.
Kinetic studies of enzymatic activity showed
curcumin binding to p300, but not as an allosteric inhibitor with binding to active sites of histone or acetyl CoA.18
In addition, curcumin was a potent and specific inhibitor

4671

Review Article

of p300/CBP HAT activity-dependent chromatin
transcription. Curcumin induced cervical cancer cell
apoptosis at concentrations of 50 to 100 lM associated
with inhibiting acetylation of histones and p53 in vivo
through specific inhibition of p300/CBP.20 In brain
glioma cell lines, curcumin induces histone hypoacetylation to activate poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase- and caspase-3–mediated apoptosis.21 In addition,
inhibition of p300 mediated by curcumin decreases
acetylation of RelA, which attenuates interaction with
IjBa, leading to decreased IjBa-dependent nuclear
export of the complex through a chromosomal region
maintenance-1–dependent pathway.22 Therefore, curcumin’s ability to suppress p300/CBP HAT activity, may
account, at least in part, for its potent nuclear factor kappa
B (NF-jB) inhibitory activity.
Curcumin and DNA Hypomethylation
Molecular docking of the interaction between curcumin
and DNA methyltransferase I suggested that curcumin covalently blocks the catalytic thiolate of C1226 of DNA
methyltransferase I to exert its inhibitory effect.23 Curcumin exists predominantly in solution as the enol form,
which serves as a Michael acceptor to covalently block the
catalytic thiol group in DNA methyltransferase I through
the C3 keto-enol moiety of the curcumin compounds,
demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin.
To validate the results of a DNA methyltransferase I
homology modeling study, inhibition of the enzymatic
activity of M.Sss1 (methyltransferase Sss1, an analog of
DNA methyltransferase I) by curcumin was assessed in
vitro. The methylation level of the double-strand oligonucleotide directly correlated with the enzymatic activity
of M.Sss1 with exposure to various concentrations of curcuminoids from 1 nM to 100 lM. The apparent IC50 of
curcumin with respect to M.Sss1 inhibition was identified
as 30 nM.23
Genomic DNA was extracted from a leukemia cell
line exposed to curcuminoids at concentrations of 0, 1, 3,
and 30 lM for 72 hours. Analyses of global DNA methylation levels showed stability at 1 lM curcumin, but
decreased by approximately 15% to 20% at 3 lM and
30 lM curcumin compared with untreated basal methylation levels, which was equivalent to decitabine-induced
decreases in global DNA methylation levels.23 These data
show that curcumin is a potent DNA hypomethylating
agent, which is consistent with its broad activity in inflammation, cancer, and many other diseases, while remaining
relatively safe in normal healthy cells. Further exploration

4672

and validation of curcuminoids as DNA hypomethylating
agents is warranted. Coincidentally, a phase 1 trial with
curcumin administered several days before docetaxel in
patients with metastatic breast cancer resulted in 5 partial
remissions and stable diseases in 3 of 8 patients.24 This
unexpectedly high response rate might result from the
clever sequential delivery of the 2 agents, which capitalized on and maximally used curcumin’s epigenetic activity
for cancer treatment.
Curcumin and Epigenetic Changes
Impacting microRNAs
MicroRNAs are small, noncoding regulatory RNAs ranging in size from 17 to 25 nucleotides, which are matured
by Dicer/Drosha (an RNase) from hairpin-structured precursors.25 MicroRNAs post-transcriptionally repress gene
expression by recognizing complementary target sites in
the 30 -untranslated regions of target mRNAs. Currently,
>500 microRNAs have been identified in humans.26
Many microRNAs exhibit characteristic expression
patterns.27 Expression of a specific microRNA can be
measured by Northern blot, RNase protection assay,
primer extension assay, and global microRNA expression
profiles.28 MicroRNAs are aberrantly expressed in diverse
cancers, differentially characteristic for specific cancer
phenotypes, stages, and other clinical variables, and play
important roles in cell cycling, programmed cell death,
cell differentiation, tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.29
Aberrant expression of microRNAs can arise
through numerous mechanisms, including genomic
abnormalities, transcriptional regulation, and processing
of microRNAs.7 Epigenetic factors also affect the expression of microRNAs.25 In many cancers, hypermethylation
of CpG islands in promoter regions and histone modifications result in heritable transcriptional silencing of tumor
suppressor genes. Some microRNAs are up-regulated by
hypomethylating agents30 and/or inhibition of histone
deacetylation.31 In addition, microRNAs may counteract
CpG methylation and the epigenome.32 For example,
miR-29 directly targets DNMT-3A and -3B. Consistent
with this observation, ectopic expression of miR-29
resulted in a global reduction of DNA methylation, abrogating the expression of tumor suppressor genes previously silenced by promoter methylation in cancer cells.33
Interestingly, curcumin modulated microRNA
expression in human pancreatic cells, up-regulating
microRNA-22 and down-regulating microRNA-199a*
through an unknown mechanism.34 Combined with the

Epigenetic Modulation by Curcumin/Fu and Kurzrock

recent finding that curcumin is a DNA hypomethylating
agent, epigenetic modulation of microRNA expression
may be an important mechanism underlying curcumin’s
biological effects. Microarray analyses of microRNA
expression in pancreatic cancer cells exposed to curcumin
at concentrations of up to 10 lM for 72 hours revealed
11 microRNAs that were significantly up-regulated and
18 microRNAs that were significantly down-regulated.
MicroRNA-22 demonstrated tumor suppressor activity
through inhibition of at least 50 target genes, showing
that a key effect of curcumin on cancer cells was mediated
by epigenetic modulation of microRNAs, which, in turn,
regulated many target genes involved in tumorigenesis,
development, and metastasis. Modulating microRNA
expression is yet another novel strategy that ultimately can
be embraced as a potential therapy for the prevention and
treatment of human cancer.29
Curcumin and Gene Expression
The diverse and broad biological activities of curcumin
are mediated through direct interaction of curcumin with
target proteins as well as epigenetic modulation of target
genes, supported by evidence that curcumin modulates
gene expression in a time- and concentration-dependent
manner in human cancer cells.35 Gene expression changes
in human colon cancer cells in response to curcumin
revealed early response genes, defined as differentially
expressed genes after exposure to curcumin for 3 to
6 hours, involved in the cell cycle (p16INK4, BUB1B,
STK6, STK12, PLK, Rb, p53, cyclin G1, and cyclin E1),
signal transduction (STAT3, STAT5b, MAPK, AKT,
VEGF, and FGFR1), DNA repair (hMLH1, MSH3, and
ERCC2), gene transcription (HDAC1, ATF4, and
EGF1), cell adhesion (annexin and integrins), and xenobiotic metabolism (GSTT2, GSTM4, and CYP1B1)
while the cells accumulated in the G2/M phase with
increased apoptosis. Expression of metallothionein genes
changed in response to curcumin at 12 to 24 hours. Tubulin genes were down-regulated after 3 hours of exposure
to curcumin at 25 lM, but up-regulated after 48 hours of
exposure to curcumin at 100 lM.36
When RNA expression profiles were compared,
diverse cell lines had variable responses to curcumin in a
time- and concentration-manner, suggesting that clinical
responses to curcumin differ because of substantial
physiologic differences in cancer cells that contribute to
diverse gene expression profiles.37 In the LNCaP prostate
cancer cell line, the number of genes regulated by curcumin with a >4-fold increase in expression were 8, 73,

Figure 1. Schematic shows curcumin’s roles in gene expression through direct interaction with transcriptional factors
such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), epigenetic modulation via inhibiting
DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1), and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes.
Cancer cell death induced by curcumin is mediated by reactivating expression of tumor suppressor genes and/or inactivating expression of oncogenes via microRNA (miRNA)
modulation.

181, 3, and 0 at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, respectively.
At 12 hours, curcumin up-regulated 181 genes and downregulated 13 genes by >4-fold in the androgen-responsive
LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, and 27 and 13 genes in
the C4-2B androgen-refractory prostate cancer cell line,
respectively.37 Therefore, curcumin-induced gene expression was dependent on dose and cell context.
Treatment of cancer cells with curcumin results in a
dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation
associated with time-, dose-, and cell context-dependent
changes in gene expression. However, the precise mechanisms by which curcumin modulates gene expression
have not been delineated. One theory is that curcumin
modulates gene expression through direct interaction
with diverse intracellular signal transduction pathways.
Here we propose the hypothesis that curcumin produces
an integrated modulation of signal transduction pathways
and epigenetic modulation (Fig. 1). In addition to direct
and indirect interactions with intracellular signal transduction pathways regulating gene expression, curcumin
inhibits both DNA methyltransferase I and HATs to
epigenetically modulate gene expression, as shown in
Table 1.
Development of Curcumin as an
Epigenetic Agent
Epidemiological evidence has shown that people who
incorporate high doses of curcumin in their diets have a
lower incidence of several common cancers such as breast,
colorectal, and prostate cancer. Numerous preclinical
reports demonstrated curcumin’s anticancer activity

through induction of apoptosis as well as sensitization of
cancer cells to other anticancer agents. Phase 1 studies of
curcumin as a single agent showed that it can be administered safely at oral doses of up to 8 g per day.38,39 In
a phase 2 study of curcumin in 21 evaluable advanced
pancreatic cancer patients, single-agent curcumin achieved
1 partial response with a 73% tumor regression, and 1
patient had stable disease for approximately 2.5 years.1
Although these data show curcumin’s promise as a single
agent for cancer control, its further development in combination with other anticancer agents is warranted. One
strategy would be to target the NF-jB pathway for chemosensitization.40 Another strategy would be to develop curcumin as a hypomethylating agent and HAT inhibitor.
DNA methylation plays an essential role in regulating normal biologic processes as well as carcinogenesis.41
DNA methylation is a heritable, DNA methyltransferaseinduced modification of DNA structure that does not
alter the specific sequence of base pairs responsible for
encoding the genome, but that can directly inhibit gene
expression.8 Two patterns of DNA methylation have been
observed in cancer cells: global hypomethylation across
the genome, and localized hypermethylation at specific
CpG islands within the gene promoter regions of specific
genes.42 Decreased methylation because of global hypomethylation could facilitate the expression of previously
quiescent proto-oncogenes and prometastatic genes and
promote tumor progression. Alternatively, an aberrant
increase in methylation patterns at previously unmethylated sites, such as the promoter regions of tumor
suppressor genes, could result in transcriptional silencing
and inability to control tumorigenesis.42 Thus far, the US

4674

Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine
and decitabine as hypomethylating agents for treating
myelodysplastic syndrome. Preclinically and clinically,
azacitidine and decitabine have demonstrated an ability to
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents as well as
biological targeted agents. Therefore, exploring curcumin
as a hypomethylating agent to induce cancer cell chemosensitization is a particularly attractive anticancer strategy.
The reversible process of histone acetylation occurring at the e-amino group of lysine residues in the Nterminal tails of core histones mediates conformational
changes in nucleosomes, and is controlled by HATs and
HDACs. The anticancer effects of HDAC inhibitors are
well known and have been shown in clinical trials. In contrast, the chemotherapeutic potential of HATs has not yet
been established. The role of HATs in cancer is complex.
Because maintaining a specific histone acetylation process
is crucial to various cell functions such as cell cycle
progression, DNA repair, cell proliferation and differentiation, mutations and/or chromosomal translocations
involving HAT genes result in development of malignancies. Loss of p300 heterozygosity and p300 mutations is
associated with glioblastoma and colorectal cancer. CBP
knockout mice had an increased incidence of cancers as
well as defects in cell proliferation. Thus, p300/CBP
appears to exert both tumor suppressor and tumor promoter properties, depending on the specific cellular context. Experiments with HAT inhibitors showed a clear
correlation between the HAT-inhibitor potency of these
compounds and their effects on cell proliferation, suggesting that HAT inhibitors have a potential role in cancer
therapy.43,44 In addition, coexposure of an HDAC inhibitor such as Trichostatin A improves the anticancer activity
of low concentrations of curcumin in human leukemia
cells,45 providing evidence that inhibition of HDACs and
HATs together may be a novel strategy for cancer
treatment.
When HATs and HDACs are physically linked as a
complex they interact with other regulators.46 One might
hypothesize that optimal therapeutic regimens can be
developed by modulating histone acetylation along with
other therapeutic approaches such as inhibition of DNA
methylation, intracellular signal transduction pathways,
and transcriptional factors, and induction of apoptotic
pathways.47 In addition to its direct interaction with
intracellular signal transduction pathways, curcumin has
enormous potential to be developed as an epigenetic
agent. Specifically, its suppression of methylation and
HATs warrants further exploration.

Epigenetic Modulation by Curcumin/Fu and Kurzrock

Although curcumin is able to directly interact with
multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways and
other target proteins, accumulating data support the
concept that epigenetic modulation by curcumin might
play a major role in cancer treatment. Thus, an understanding and application of the findings cited in this review will
facilitate clinical development of curcumin in combination
with other anticancer agents for cancer treatment.
