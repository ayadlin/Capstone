Abstract
The oncogene DJ-1 has been associated with multiple cancers,
including prostate cancer, where it can be stabilized by
androgens and antiandrogens. However, little data exist on the
expression pattern and function of DJ-1 in prostate cancer. To
address the function of DJ-1 in prostate, a yeast two-hybrid
screen was done to identify novel DJ-1 binding proteins. The
androgen receptor (AR) was identified and confirmed as a DJ1 binding partner. This is the first evidence that DJ-1 directly
interacts with AR. We also show that modulation of DJ-1
expression regulated AR transcriptional activity. Importantly,
both the subcellular localization of DJ-1 and the interaction
with AR are regulated by androgens and antiandrogens.
Additionally, immunohistochemical staining on two human
prostate cancer tissue arrays was done providing the first
large-scale expression analysis of DJ-1 in prostate. DJ-1
expression did not change with Gleason pattern but increased
after androgen deprivation therapy, indicating that it may be
involved in the development of androgen independence. These
data provide a novel mechanism where DJ-1–mediated
regulation of AR may promote the progression of prostate
cancer to androgen independence. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4630–7]

Introduction
Multiple molecular events are involved in prostate cancer
initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis. Despite the diverse
etiology, there is at least one universal similarity to the disease—
the requirement of androgens and androgen receptor (AR) for
tumor progression (1–7). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; also
known as neoadjuvant hormone therapy) is initially effective to
treat prostate cancer and remains the most common treatment
regimen for advanced disease. Although ADT initially causes tumor
regression, the eventual evolution of prostate cancer from an
androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent phenotype
allows continuation of tumor progression (reviewed in ref. 8).
There are many hypotheses for the development of androgenindependent prostate cancer (AIPC). Some of these involve
increased cellular proliferation/decreased apoptosis and, in some
patients, increased serum prostate-specific antigen corresponding
with promiscuous or increased AR activity (9, 10).
We hypothesized that identification of proteins that increase
during ADT would modulate molecular changes that promote and/

or maintain AIPC. To this end, a proteomic analysis of primary
human prostate epithelial (HPE) cells after treatment with the
antiandrogen flutamide was done (11). DJ-1 was identified as one
protein that increased during flutamide treatment. Western blot
analysis confirmed this result, showing that DJ-1 and AR protein
levels increased following treatment with dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), the synthetic androgen R1881, or the antiandrogen
hydroxy-flutamide (OH-flutamide) in LNCaP cells. Blocking protein
synthesis with cycloheximide revealed that the increase in DJ-1 was
due to increased protein stability (11). This indicated that DJ-1 and
AR expression was regulated by both androgens and antiandrogen
therapy and may be involved in AIPC.
DJ-1 is a 20-kDa ubiquitous cytoplasmic and nuclear oncogene
also known as PARK7 (12–14). Increased DJ-1 expression is capable
of transforming NIH 3T3 cells either alone or, to a greater extent, in
conjunction with c-myc or H-ras overexpression (15). Since this
initial discovery, overexpression of DJ-1 has been associated with a
number of human diseases including Parkinson’s disease (12, 14)
and carcinomas of lung, breast, and prostate (16, 17). Increased DJ1 expression in lung cancer correlates with poor clinical prognosis.
Further, increased expression of DJ-1 in breast cancer has been
associated with decreased expression of the tumor suppressor
phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10
(PTEN; ref. 17). Despite the oncogenic properties of DJ-1, its
functional significance in prostate cancer development and
progression has not been determined.
Previously, we showed that antiandrogen treatment could
stimulate AR-regulated signaling in a subpopulation of HPE cells
cultured from prostate biopsy specimens (11). Proteomic analysis
identified DJ-1 as a protein whose expression was up-regulated by
both androgen and antiandrogen treatment and that this increase
was due to DJ-1 and AR protein stability. Therefore, identification
of DJ-1 binding proteins would help elucidate the DJ-1 pathway in
prostate cancer and its role in AIPC. To address this, primary HPE
cells were derived from a punch biopsy of human prostate and the
androgen responsiveness of these cells was determined using the
transiently infected gene reporter assay as described (11). Briefly,
this assay uses an androgen-responsive reporter to determine
whether AR-regulated signaling in primary HPE cells is androgen
responsive, androgen independent, or flutamide activated. Because
we previously showed that DJ-1 increased after flutamide
treatment, flutamide-activated HPE cells were used to generate a
novel cDNA library. This library was screened using DJ-1 and
identified AR as a DJ-1 binding partner. Previously, DJ-1 was
thought to control AR activity through an indirect mechanism,
although these studies were done after transient transfection of AR
and DJ-1 in nonprostate cell lines (18, 19). This is the first evidence
that endogenous DJ-1 directly binds AR. Additionally, DJ-1
subcellular localization and AR binding are hormonally regulated.

Further, two prostate cancer tissue arrays were analyzed, which
provided the first large-scale expression analysis for DJ-1 in
prostate cancer. The first of the two arrays is arranged by Gleason
pattern, and the second is arranged by length of time of ADT. DJ-1
immunohistochemical staining on these arrays shows that DJ-1 is
expressed in benign as well as high Gleason pattern regions. DJ-1
expression increased significantly in patients receiving >6 months
of ADT, indicating that DJ-1 may contribute to the development of
AIPC. Taken together, these data provide a new mechanism for
regulation of AR in androgen-independent prostate epithelial cells.

Materials and Methods
Yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast two-hybrid assay was done using the
Matchmaker System (Clontech) following the manufacturer’s protocols. A
cDNA library was generated from primary HPE cells that exhibited AR
activation via TIGR assay (11). cDNAs were cloned into the pGADT7
plasmid (Clontech) where they were expressed as fusion proteins to the
GAL4 activation domain. For the bait protein, full-length human DJ-1 cDNA
was cloned into the pGBKT7 plasmid and expressed as a fusion to GAL4
DNA binding domain. Plasmids were transformed into AH109 yeast strain
and positive clones were selected on high-stringency dropout plates ( Leu/
Trp/ His/ Ade) containing X-a-galactose. Plasmid DNA was extracted,
transformed into DH5-a competent E. coli, and sequenced using T7
promoter.
Cell culture and transfection. The LNCaP human prostate cancer
cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and was
cultured as described (11). The LAPC4 human prostate cancer cell line was
a gift from Dr. Charles L. Sawyers. LAPC4 cells were cultured in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, with 1 penicillin/
streptomycin.
Western blot analysis. Protein concentration analysis and SDS-PAGE
were done as described (11). After blocking with 5% skim milk, membranes
were incubated with the following dilutions of various antibodies: 1:1,000
goat anti–DJ-1 antibody (Abcam); 1:1,000 rabbit anti-AR (N-20) antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:5,000 mouse anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Imgenex); 1:1,000 mouse anti-RhoA (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); and 1:1,000 [in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)]
mouse anti–histone H1 (Abcam). Membranes were washed and subjected to
1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-antigoat immunoglobulin
G (IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-antirabbit IgG;
or 1:10,000 HRP-antimouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins
were visualized as described (11).
Immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in 300-AL cold lysis buffer [1%
Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 5 mmol/L
NaF, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce
Biotechnology)] in the cold room. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation
and 400 to 500 Ag of total protein were immunoprecipitated overnight at
4jC using 10 Ag rabbit anti-AR antibody or 5 Ag mouse anti-hemagglutinin
(HA) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Complexes were pulled down
using ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G beads (Pierce Biotechnology).
Immunoprecipitates were washed in 1 phosphate buffed saline (PBS),
resuspended in 1 Lammeli buffer, and subjected Western blot analysis.
Luciferase assays. LAPC4 cells were plated in 24-well plates (Falcon)
and transfected with androgen-responsive luciferase reporter, ARR2PBluciferase. Firefly luciferase is driven by the androgen-responsive region of
the rat probasin promoter similar to the ARR2PB-CAT reporter (11, 20).
Medium was changed to IMDM containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1 penicillin/streptomycin, supplemented with
10 9 mol/L DHT. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were lysed in 1
Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation and
protein concentration was determined as described above. Twenty microliters of lysate were loaded into 96-well plates (Corning) and luciferase
activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a
LUMIstar luminometer (BMG Lab. Technologies, Inc.). Firefly luciferase

activity was normalized to protein concentration and expressed as fold
change over nontransfected controls. Each column represents the mean of
at least three replicates F SE and each experiment was repeated at least
twice.
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Cells were plated onto six-well
plates (Falcon) and allowed to attach overnight. On the second day, cells
were washed in Hanks buffer and changed to medium containing 10%
charcoal-stripped FBS. On the third day, medium was again replaced with
fresh medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and the following
treatments: ethanol (vehicle control), 10 8 mol/L DHT (LNCaP), 10 9 mol/L
DHT (LAPC4), 10 5 mol/L OH-flutamide (LNCaP), 10 6 mol/L OHflutamide (LAPC4), 10 5 mol/L bicalutamide (LNCaP), or 10 6 mol/L
bicalutamide (LAPC4). Optimal concentrations of androgens and antiandrogens for LNCaP cells were experimentally determined previously (11)
whereas concentrations for LAPC4 cells were communicated from Dr.
Sawyers’ lab. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were harvested by
trypsinization, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared using
NEPER Kit and HALT protease inhibitors according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Pierce Biotechnology).
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. LNCaP and LAPC4
cells were grown on glass chamber slides (Lab-Tek Products). Cells were
treated as described in nuclear/cytoplasmic extract section. Twenty-four
hours after treatment, slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for
15 min, washed in PBS, permeabilized in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min,
and blocked in PBS with 3% BSA and 3% donkey serum for 30 min at room
temperature. Slides were incubated with 1:1,000 dilution anti–DJ-1; 1:500
dilution ( for LNCaP) or 1:100 dilution ( for LAPC4) anti-AR; and 1:2,500
dilution of mouse anti–SC-35 (Sigma) antibody overnight at 4jC, and
subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated donkey antirabbit, Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated donkey anti-goat, and Alexa Fluor 654–
conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for
1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed, mounted in 50% glycerol,
and imaged with a Zeiss LSM510 Meta Laser Scanning microscope. Stacks
were acquired with LSM510 software; Z-projections and merged images
were made with NIH ImageJ. All confocal images were acquired with a PlanApochromat 63/1.4 oil differential interference contrast microscope
objective at the following settings: wavelength 488 nm 5%, 543 nm 37%,
and 633 nm 10%; filters: Ch2-1: BP 505-550, Ch3-2: BP 560-615, and ChS1-3:
649-756 with a pinhole of 281 micrometers. Images have identical
microscope settings between treatment groups. Image brightness/contrast
was not altered between treatment groups; thus, intensity comparisons
could be made. Quantification and images of colocalization were obtained
using Metamorph software.
Human tissue arrays and immunohistochemistry. Tissue microarrays
(TMA) were generated using H&E slides from 112 radical prostatectomy
specimens ( from 1989 to 2003) obtained from the Vancouver General
Hospital. Benign and cancer sites were identified and marked in donor
paraffin blocks using matching H&E reference slides. TMA was constructed
using a manual tissue microarrayer (Beecher Instruments). Each marked
block for benign and cancer was sampled four times with a core diameter of
0.6 mm arrayed in rectangular pattern with 1 mm between the centers of
each core creating a quadruplicate TMA layout. Samples were ordered by
histopathology and tumor Gleason grade or by length of ADT. The Gleason
TMA contains 336 tissue cores representing 84 patients. ADT patients
received monotherapy or combination therapy with the luteinizing
hormone–releasing hormone antagonists Lupron or Zoladex and the
antiandrogens flutamide or cyproterone acetate. The ADT TMA contains
294 cores representing 98 patients. DJ-1 immunohistochemistry was done
using 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti–DJ-1 antibody (Abcam) and visualized
using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine and standard techniques.
Hormones. DHT is commercially available from Sigma. OH-flutamide
was purchased from LKT Laboratories, Inc. Bicalutamide was provided by
AstraZeneca, Inc.
Plasmids and siRNA. DJ-1 cDNA was cloned into pCruz-HA plasmid
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and transiently transfected into LAPC4 cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells expressing NH2-terminally HAtagged DJ-1 were selected using 400 Ag/mL G418. Western blot confirmed

expression of tagged DJ-1. To knock down DJ-1 expression, pooled
siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon) directed against DJ-1 were
transfected (200 pmol per well of a six-well plate) into LAPC4 cells using
Lipofectamie 2000. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection. To ensure
specificity of the chosen siRNA pool, a pool of nonspecific siRNAs (200 pmol
per well of a six-well plate) was used as a control (Dharmacon Nontargeting
siRNA #1).

Results
DJ-1 binds the AR. To identify DJ-1 binding partners, the yeast
two-hybrid system and a cDNA library from flutamide-activated
HPE cells were used. Full-length DJ-1 cDNA was used to screen the
library and identified a region of AR (Fig. 1B). The AR fragment
contained a region of the NH2-terminal activation domain, the
entire DNA binding domain, and a portion of the ligand binding
domain (Fig. 1A).
The DJ-1-AR interaction was confirmed by AR immunoprecipitation in the LAPC4 cell line. These androgen-dependent cells
were derived from a lymph node metastasis and retain wild-type
AR and prostate-specific antigen expression, unlike most prostate
cancer cell lines that have lost AR expression or have AR
mutations (21). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous AR pulled
down DJ-1 (Fig. 1C). The reciprocal immunoprecipitation was
done in LAPC4 cells expressing a NH2-terminally HA-tagged DJ-1.
Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody coimmunoprecipitated HA-tagged DJ-1, endogenous DJ-1, and AR. DJ-1 exists as an
obligatory dimer (22). Therefore, we postulate that HA-DJ-1 binds
endogenous DJ-1, explaining the precipitation of both tagged and
untagged DJ-1 (Fig. 1D).
Hormonal treatment increases the interaction between DJ-1
and AR. Immunoprecipitations following hormonal treatment in
LAPC4 and LNCaP cells were used to determine if these treatments
regulated the DJ-1-AR interaction. LAPC4 and LNCaP cells were
serum starved overnight and then treated with ethanol, 10 8 mol/L
DHT (LNCaP), 10 9 mol/L DHT (LAPC4), 10 5 mol/L OHflutamide (LNCaP), 10 6 mol/L OH-flutamide (LAPC4), 10 5 mol/L
bicalutamide (LNCaP), or 10 6 mol/L bicalutamide (LAPC4) for

24 h. In both LAPC4 and LNCaP cells, antiandrogen treatment with
either OH-flutamide or bicalutamide increased the amount of DJ-1
bound to AR (Fig. 2). DHT treatment seemed to increase the DJ-1AR interaction in LNCaP cells more than in LAPC4 cells (Fig. 2).
Androgens and antiandrogens increase DJ-1 nuclear localization. To determine localization of DJ-1 in the prostate cancer
cell lines LAPC4 and LNCaP, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were
prepared. Cells were treated as described above. Twenty-four hours
after treatment, cells were harvested and cytoplasmic and nuclear
extracts were prepared using the NEPER kit (Pierce). Western blot
analysis revealed that DJ-1 was predominantly cytoplasmic, but
both androgen (DHT) and antiandrogen (OH-flutamide and
bicalutamide) treatment increased DJ-1 expression in the nuclear
fraction (Fig. 3A). As expected, AR expression was very low in the
absence of androgens, but when treated with DHT, AR expression
increased and was predominantly nuclear (Fig. 3A). Histone H1 and
RhoA were used as nuclear and cytoplasmic controls, respectively,
to show equal loading between lanes (Fig. 3A; ref. 23). The same

experiment was done in LNCaP cells, where an increase in DJ-1
after hormonal treatment was previously documented (11). LNCaP
cells showed increased nuclear DJ-1 after hormonal treatment, with
a greater increase in nuclear DJ-1 with DHT than in the LAPC4 cell
line (Fig. 3B). AR was predominantly nuclear in all treatment
groups, consistent with previous reports (24–26).
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to
confirm the presence of DJ-1 in both nuclear and cytoplasmic
compartments. LAPC4 and LNCaP cells were plated on chamber
slides and treated as described above. Cells were stained for DJ-1,
AR, and SC-35 and visualized with appropriate secondary anti-

bodies. SC-35 is a nuclear speckle marker and was included to
identify sites of active transcription (27). As with nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts, DJ-1 (green) was predominantly cytoplasmic
but was also present in the nucleus in both LAPC4 and LNCaP cell
lines (Fig. 3C). AR (red) localization also confirmed results from
nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts in that AR expression was low in
the absence of androgens in LAPC4 cells but driven to the nucleus
on treatment with DHT (Fig. 3C). Further, AR-positive nuclei were
observed regardless of treatment in LNCaP cells, confirming
observations from Western blot analyses (Fig. 3C). The merged
images show colocalization between DJ-1 and AR, indicated by

yellow in merged images (Fig. 3C, white arrows) but these areas
appear distinct from nuclear speckles (Fig. 3C, white asterisks).
Inset areas show low-magnification images of individual channels
(Fig. 3C).
Yellow pixels from the LNCaP images in Fig. 3C were displayed
alone and indicate that DJ-1-AR colocalization increased during
hormonal treatment (Fig. 3D). White dashed lines outline nuclei
(Fig. 3D). Colocalization of DJ-1 and AR was quantified by
determining the percentage of colocalized pixels per image
(Fig. 3D). DJ-1-AR colocalization was greatest with DHT treatment, followed by OH-flutamide and bicalutamide. Each treatment showed a distinct pattern. DHT and bicalutamide treatment
resulted in similar colocalization throughout the nucleus, whereas
DJ-1-AR with OH-flutamide treatment seemed to concentrate
just within the nuclear perimeter. DJ-1-AR colocalization was not
quantified in LAPC4 cells due to low AR levels except after DHT
treatment.
DJ-1 regulates AR transcriptional activity. An androgenresponsive luciferase reporter was used to determine how
modulation of DJ-1 expression affected AR activity. A region of
the probasin promoter, termed (ARR2PB), containing two androgen
responsive regions, was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase
gene resulting in the ARR2PB-luciferase reporter (11, 20). Overexpression of DJ-1 (HA-DJ-1 + luc) increased AR activity f20-fold
(P < 0.001) compared with parental LAPC4 cells transfected with
the luciferase reporter and with cells transfected with reporter and
an empty plasmid control (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis showed
that transfection with pCruz-HA-DJ-1 plasmid doubled the
expression level of DJ-1 but did not change the expression level
of AR (Fig. 4B).
Similarly to overexpression, knockdown of DJ-1 expression
influences AR-regulated transcription. Pooled siRNAs were cotransfected into LAPC4 cells along with the ARR2PB-luciferase reporter.

Knockdown of DJ-1 expression decreased AR activity 5- to 10-fold
compared with LAPC4 cells with reporter alone (P < 0.01; Fig. 4C).
The decrease in DJ-1 expression after transfection of siRNAs
resulted in f50% decrease in DJ-1 protein level compared with
GAPDH loading control (Fig. 4D ). Transfection of control
nonspecific siRNA did not change DJ-1 expression compared with
nontransfected LAPC4 cells. Knockdown of DJ-1 did not change AR
expression, indicating that AR expression was not regulated by DJ-1
(Fig. 4D).
DJ-1 expression does not increase with Gleason pattern.
Prostate samples from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1989 and 2003 were obtained from Vancouver
General Hospital. These patients received no treatment before
surgery. The samples were grouped based on Gleason score and
arranged on the slide based on predominant Gleason pattern for
each tissue core in the following groups: benign, Gleason 2, Gleason
3, Gleason 4, and Gleason 5. The total number of patients represented by each group is shown (Fig. 5A).
DJ-1 immunohistochemical staining was done on this array and
quantitated based on intensity. Four areas per tissue core were
evaluated using the following scale: 0, no staining of any cells; 1,
faint staining; 2, moderate intensity staining; and 3, intense
staining. DJ-1 was present in all five sample groups at moderate
intensity, but no statistically significant change was observed,
indicating that DJ-1 does not increase with Gleason pattern
(Fig. 5B). Figure 5C shows representative areas from each group at
low and high magnifications (bars, 20 Am). DJ-1 is predominantly
expressed in luminal epithelial cells and is both cytoplasmic and
nuclear.
DJ-1 expression increases in human prostates with ADT. The
second tissue array was generated identically to the first. This array
was composed of samples from patients who received no ADT,
<3 months ADT, 3 to 6 months ADT, or >6 months ADT before

expression by 50%. AR expression did

The percent knockdown of DJ-1 compared
with nonspecific siRNA was determined
by densitometric analysis using ImageJ
software.

undergoing radical prostatectomy surgery at Vancouver General
Hospital. Figure 6A indicates the number of patients per group.
DJ-1 staining intensity was evaluated identically to Gleason
TMA. DJ-1 expression increased significantly in the >6 months ADT
group as compared with the untreated group (P < 0.01; Fig. 6B).
Figure 6C shows representative cores from each treatment group at
low and high magnifications (bars, 20 Am). DJ-1 was both
cytoplasmic and nuclear in luminal epithelial cells. The increase
in the intensity of DJ-1 staining after prolonged ADT treatment
suggests that DJ-1 may be involved in the emergence of AIPC as our
previous data suggested.

Discussion
DJ-1 is a diverse signaling protein that seems to have multiple
roles that may largely depend on cell type and cellular environment
(13, 15–17, 19, 28, 29). DJ-1 was initially thought to activate AR
through indirect mechanisms [e.g., by interacting with the AR
binding region of protein inhibitor of activated STAT-a (PIASx-a)
and preventing it from binding and inhibiting AR; ref. 19]. It has
also been reported that DJ-1 represses AR activity in the SK-NBE(2)C neuroblastoma cell line (30). From these conflicting reports,
it seems that DJ-1 regulation of AR may be cell type dependent. We
show that DJ-1 directly interacts with AR and functions as a
positive regulator of AR signaling in two prostate cancer cell lines,
possibly through multiple mechanisms.
Direct interaction between DJ-1 and AR was determined using
a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library generated from
flutamide-activated HPE cells (Fig. 1). Multiple yeast two-hybrid
screens have been done to identify DJ-1 binding partners, but AR
has never been reported among them (18, 19, 28, 29, 31). DJ-1 was
shown to interact with the apoptotic protein Daxx when a human
brain cDNA library was screened using this technique. This
interaction was confirmed and shown to prevent cellular

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptosis following apoptotic stimuli in neuronal cells (28). The
current screen did not identify previously identified DJ-1 binding
partners, which may be due to differences in the cDNA libraries
and cell lines used. Previous studies were done in COS and
293 cells and relied on transient transfection into these ARnegative cell lines, whereas our experiments were carried out with
prostate cell lines and largely examined endogenous proteins.
The DJ-1-AR interaction is hormonally regulated in both LNCaP
and LAPC4 cell lines. Specifically, antiandrogen treatment
increased the DJ-1-AR interaction in both cell lines to a greater
extent than DHT (Fig. 2). Immunofluorescence also showed that
hormonal treatment increased the colocalization between DJ-1 and
AR in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3C and D). Colocalization was not
quantified from immunofluorescent images in LAPC4 cells due to
low AR levels except after DHT treatment.
Further, both androgens and antiandrogens increased nuclear
localization of DJ-1, providing a potential mechanism for DJ-1
regulation of AR in the nucleus. Increased nuclear DJ-1 was
observed after androgen and antiandrogen treatment in both
LAPC4 and LNCaP cell lines (Fig. 3A–C). In LAPC4 cells, DHT,
OH-flutamide, and bicalutamide treatment resulted in approximately equal levels of nuclear DJ-1 (Fig. 3A). However, in LNCaP
cells, DHT treatment resulted in higher levels of nuclear DJ-1 than
either OH-flutamide or bicalutamide (Fig. 3B–D). Additionally,
DHT and bicalutamide treatment resulted in DJ-1-AR colocalization throughout the nucleus, whereas DJ-1-AR seemed to
concentrate just inside the nuclear perimeter after OH-flutamide
treatment. These differences may be due to the well-characterized
AR T877A substitution mutation in LNCaP cells (32–34). This
mutation allows flutamide to exhibit agonist activity; however,
because this mutation causes an AR conformational change, it
could inhibit the interaction with DJ-1. Alternatively, the differences between the LNCaP and LAPC4 cells may be due to

differences in signaling pathways between the cell lines. For
example, DJ-1 has been shown to antagonize the tumor
suppressor PTEN (17). LNCaP cells lack functional PTEN (35)
whereas the PTEN pathway is intact in LAPC4 cells (36). Because
the exact role of DJ-1 in the PTEN pathway remains unclear, it is
possible that loss or inactivation of members of this pathway
alters the function of DJ-1.
Modulation of DJ-1 expression regulated AR transcriptional
activity in LAPC4 cells, suggesting that overexpression of DJ-1
could facilitate AR activation in the absence of androgens (Fig. 4A
and C). We previously identified DJ-1 as a protein that was upregulated with antiandrogen treatment in primary HPE and
LNCaP cells. TMA analysis of DJ-1 expression shows that DJ-1 did
not change with Gleason pattern but increased significantly after
6 months of ADT (Figs. 5 and 6). This correlates with previous
data and is the first reported large-scale evaluation of DJ-1
expression in prostate cancer. Additionally, the importance of this
study should be emphasized due to the difficulty in obtaining
tissue samples from patients who received ADT before surgery.
However, the current study did not evaluate DJ-1 staining
intensity in relation to the patient’s overall prostate cancer risk,
which is determined by clinical variables such as prostate-specific
antigen and total Gleason score. This is a potential future
direction and will determine whether DJ-1 staining intensity
correlates with prostate cancer recurrence or time to recurrence.
Current and previous data show that antiandrogens stabilize
DJ-1, increase nuclear localization, and increase the interaction

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

between DJ-1 and AR. Further, DJ-1 expression increases in
patients who received >6 months ADT providing clinical evidence
that DJ-1 may participate in AIPC. Taken together, these data
show that DJ-1 is a novel AR binding protein that may be part of
a class of coregulators modulated by antiandrogens. Factors that
are regulated by antiandrogens, such as DJ-1, may increase during
antiandrogen therapy to activate AR in the absence of androgens.
Future studies are needed to identify other antiandrogenregulated genes and to better understand the role they play in
prostate cancer progression and activation of AR signaling in the
absence of ligand.
