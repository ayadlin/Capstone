Abstract
Notch signaling is important for tumor angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor A. Blockade of
the Notch ligand Dll4 inhibits tumor growth in a paradoxical way. Dll4 inhibition increases endothelial cell sprouting,
but vessels show reduced perfusion. The reason for this lack of perfusion is not currently understood. Here we report
that inhibition of Notch signaling in endothelial cell using an inducible binary transgenic system limits VEGFAdriven tumor growth and causes endothelial dysfunction. Neither excessive endothelial cell sprouting nor defects of
pericyte abundance accompanied the inhibition of tumor growth and functional vasculature. However, biochemical and functional analysis revealed that endothelial nitric oxide production is decreased by Notch inhibition.
Treatment with the soluble guanylate cyclase activator BAY41-2272, a vasorelaxing agent that acts downstream of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by directly activating its soluble guanylyl cyclase receptor, rescued blood
vessel function and tumor growth. We show that reduction in nitric oxide signaling is an early alteration induced by
Notch inhibition and suggest that lack of functional vessels observed with Notch inhibition is secondary to
inhibition of nitric oxide signaling. Coculture and tumor growth assays reveal that Notch-mediated nitric oxide
production in endothelial cell requires VEGFA signaling. Together, our data support that eNOS inhibition is
responsible for the tumor growth and vascular function defects induced by endothelial Notch inhibition. This study
uncovers a novel mechanism of nitric oxide production in endothelial cells in tumors, with implications for
understanding the peculiar character of tumor blood vessels. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2402–11. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of normal and
pathologic vascular remodeling (1, 2). In endothelial cells, NO
is mainly produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS; refs. 3
and 4). Genetic ablation of eNOS and pharmacologic
approaches have shown that NO contributes to tumor progression by maintaining blood ﬂow (5–7), inducing vascular hyperpermeability (7, 8), recruiting pericytes and promoting vessel
morphogenesis (4), and reducing endothelial cell–leucocyte
interactions (6). eNOS is activated by phosphorylation of the
Ser1117 residue, which is regulated by multiple signaling path-

ways (1, 2). In this context, the prototypical pro-angiogenic
agent VEGFA was shown to activate eNOS in various studies (1,
2). The VEGFA-NO signaling axis is also believed to play a role in
tumor angiogenesis but the mechanisms involved are not fully
characterized. Recently, we have shown that Notch activates
eNOS during embryonic heart development (9).
The Notch family comprises 4 heterodimeric transmembrane receptors and 5 ligands (10). Ligand-mediated Notch
activation culminates in the cleavage of the Notch receptor,
resulting in untethering of the intracellular domain that then
translocates to the nucleus to induce transcription of genes
involved in various aspects of cellular function (10). During
normal and tumor angiogenesis induced by VEGFA, Notch
signaling regulates blood vessel patterning (11). VEGFA
induces the expression of the Notch ligand Dll4 in endothelial
tip cells, which in turn activates Notch in the stalk endothelial
cell, and results in decreased expression of VEGFR2. This
diminishes endothelial cell responsiveness to VEGFA and thus
limits endothelial cell sprouting. Conversely, strategies that
hinder Dll4 signaling produce vascular networks with
increased ramiﬁcations but with reduced blood perfusion,
consequently inhibiting tumor growth (12–14). In contrast,
activation of Notch by its ligand Jagged1 has a distinct role on
angiogenesis during neonatal retina development (15). Jagged1
promotes angiogenesis by blocking Dll4 interaction with the

Notch-Induced NO Is Required for Tumor Blood Vessel Function

Notch1 receptor, restricting Notch activation in stalk cells, and
increasing VEGFR3 expression in tip cells (15). The glycosamamnylltransferases of the Fringe family ﬁne-tune this tipstalk cell selection by increasing the afﬁnity of the Notch
receptor for Delta member Notch ligands while decreasing
Jagged1-Notch afﬁnity (15).
Despite several studies documenting that Notch inhibition
results in the generation of nonproductive vasculature when
Dll4 is blocked, the mechanism for this phenomenon has not
been fully deﬁned (12–14). Furthermore, the effect of endothelial-speciﬁc pan-Notch inactivation in endothelial cell during tumor neovascularisation remains unexplored as previous
studies used strategies to block Dll4 to inhibit Notch in
endothelial cell, which is expressed mainly in tips cells (12–14).
Here we used an inducible transgenic mouse model to study
the role of endothelial-speciﬁc Notch inactivation during
tumor neovascularization. In this model, all activated Notch
members are blocked by Tet-inducible, endothelial-speciﬁc
expression of dominant-negative (dn)MAML (9). Lewis lung
carcinoma (LLC) cells engineered to express VEGFA showed
poorly perfused vasculature and diminished tumor growth in
vivo in dnMAML mice without inducing aberrant increased
ramiﬁcation of the microvasculature as reported for Dll4
blockade (12–14). This observation led us to hypothesize that
the Notch-VEGFA signaling axis in endothelial cell may have an
important role in tumor blood vessel function independent of
regulating sprouting angiogenesis. Indeed, we found that
speciﬁc endothelial Notch activity in the context of increased
VEGF signaling is required for eNOS activation, and that the
NO–soluble guanyl cyclase (sGC) ligand–receptor pairing and
activation is critical for permitting tumor perfusion in larger
blood vessels but not in capillaries. Improving vascular function by activating sGC independent of NO bypasses the Notch
inhibitory effect on tumor perfusion. Our results suggest that
endothelial cell Notch is important for tumor growth and blood
vessel perfusion in response to VEGF by regulating NO
production.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Animal studies were approved by the University of British
Columbia Animal Care Committee. LLC control cells transduced with empty vector (LLC-neo) or a VEGFA165 construct
(LLC-VEGFA) were generated with the retroviral system
MSCV-pac as previously described (16). B16F10 melanoma
cells expressing VEGFA (B16F10-VEGFA) were generated as
described for LLC-VEGFA (16). All parental cell lines were from
American Type Culture Collection and not authenticated. All
cells lines were regularly tested and found negative for
mycoplasma.
Animals and tumor studies
VE-cadherin (VEC)-tTA transgenic (Tg; ref. 17), control
(wild-type and single Tg VEC-tTA or TetOS-dnMAML-GFP
Tg; ref. 9) and double Tg mice VEC-tTA-TetOS-dnMAML-GFP
from the mating of C57Bl6 with CD1 background in which the
different transgenic lines were generated as previously
described (9). In some experiments, CD1 mice backcrossed

www.aacrjournals.org

into the C57Bl6 background for 8 generations to conduct
isogenic tumor experiments were also used. Doxycycline (Dox;
100 mg/mL) was added to the drinking water from breeding,
changed every other day, and withdrawn 7 days before tumor
implantation to induce dnMAML-GFP expression. To generate a
short induction of dnMAML-GFP expression, Dox was replaced
by tetracycline (Tet; 100 mg/mL) 5 days before tumor implantation. Tet was changed every day and withdrawn 16 hours
before tumor harvest as indicated. BAY41-2272 (10 mg/kg)
was injected intraperitoneally at days 8, 10, and 12 posttumor
implantation to activate soluble guanylyl cyclase (NO receptor)
independent of NO. The vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was injected as a control treatment. The eNOS inhibitor N5-(1iminoethyl)-L-ornithine, dihydrochloride (L-NIO; Cayman) was
injected intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg) every day from day 7 to 13.
The vehicle saline was injected similarly as a control treatment.
LLC-VEGFA or B16F10-VEGFA cells were implanted subcutaneously in the ﬂank of 6- to 8-week-old mice.
Flow cytometry, immunoﬂuorescent staining, and image
analysis
Flow cytometry following staining with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole or propidium iodide, CD45-APC-Cy7, CD31PerCPeFluor710, or PDGFRb-APC (eBiosciences) was performed on an Inﬂux cell sorter (BD BioSciences) as described
(18). Tumor cryosections were ﬁxed and stained with rat antimouse VE-cadherin, rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen),
rabbit anti-human Desmin (Lab Vision), rabbit anti-phosphoSer1117 eNOS (Cell Signalling), and anti-goat anti-GFP-FITC
(Abcam). Functional blood vessels were quantiﬁed by tail vein
injection of either DiOC7 or DilC18 (3) depending on the
ﬂuorophore used for the vascular markers. The NO-reactive
dye diaminorhodamine 4M-AM (DAR4M, 25 mmol/kg; SantaCruz) was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before mice were
killed as described (9). A custom robotic microscope was used
to image immunoﬂuorescent staining across entire tumor
sections at 0.75 mm/pixel resolution, as previously described
(19). Images were quantiﬁed using customized NIH-ImageJ
software (19). The quantiﬁcation of NO production in the
microvasculature and larger vessels was performed with the
activated eNOS (phospho-Ser1117)-speciﬁc antibody and the
NO-speciﬁc probe DAR4M. For microvasculature quantiﬁcation of activated eNOS and DAR4M staining was performed
across the entire cryosection. For larger vessels, images of
cross-sections from mural cell-invested blood vessels, which
have larger lumina were separately analyzed from the microvasculature. Identical thresholds for object pixel size and
brightness were used for the quantiﬁcation of microvasculature and larger vessels.
Endothelial coculture assay
HMEC control (empty vector) or overexpressing a human
Jagged1 (Jag1) construct (20) were cultured with MCDB (Sigma) supplemented with 20% FBS, penicillin–streptomycin,
glutamine, ECGS, and heparin. A total of 10,000 HMEC parental
cells along with 10,000 HMEC-control or HMEC-Jag1 cells were
seeded in multiculture chamber slides (BD Biosciences) the
day before treatment with 2 mmol/L of the speciﬁc VEGFR2

DAR4M (10 mmol/L; ref. 9) for the last hour treatment with
Ki8751, washed with PBS, ﬁxed with PFA 4% for 10 minutes,
rinsed, dried, and imaged by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
Reverse transcription PCR assay
FACS-sorted cells were washed once with PBS and snap
frozen at 80 C in lysis buffer until RNA extraction with the
RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer instructions (Qia-

gen). The cDNA from total RNA samples of sorted or total cell
fractions were generated using SuperScript II with random
nonamers primers according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The ﬁnal 50 mL cDNA mixture was diluted
by adding 150 mL H2O and 2.5 mL of this dilution was used with
5 mL of primers (1 mmol/L each) and 7.5 mL of SybrGreen
(Roche) for qPCR reactions using an ABI 7900 Thermal cycler
instrument (Applied Biosystems). The Gapdh gene was used to
normalize expression.

is also impacted. We hypothesized that increasing VEGFA
signaling would sensitize tumors to Notch inhibition, as
VEGFA activates endothelial cell Notch signaling by increasing Dll4 expression in tip cells (12–14, 27). As expected,
tumor growth of LLC overexpressing VEGFA (LLC-VEGFA)
was signiﬁcantly reduced in VEC-tTA  TetOS-dnMAMLGFP double Tg animals compared with littermate control
mice (Fig. 1A), but LLC-vector cells, which express low levels
of VEGFA (28), were not impacted by Notch inhibition (Fig.

conﬁrmed endothelial cell–speciﬁc expression of the
dnMAML-GFP transgene. As expected, the expression of
Notch target genes Hey1, Hes1, and Dll4 were reduced in
the tumor endothelial cell (Fig. 1D; ref. 15). In addition, Hey1

Results
Endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition blocks tumor
growth but does not increase microvessel density
To study the role of endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch blockade on tumor angiogenesis, we used a tetracycline (Tet)based inducible system expressing a dominant-negative
form of the Notch coactivator MAML fused to GFP
(dnMAML-GFP; ref. 9). dnMAML has been used to assess
the effect of pan-inhibition of Notch signaling used in
various vascular models, and although found to be specifically inhibitory to Notch signaling (22–26), one cannot
entirely rule out the possibility that some unknown pathway

pan-endothelial cell Notch inhibition in double Tg mice in
both tip (Dll4þ) and stalk (Dll4) cells.
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis conﬁrmed endothelial cell–
speciﬁc expression of the dnMAML-GFP transgene (Fig. 2A).
In contrast to Dll4 blockade, which leads to excessive
sprouting of the tumor vasculature, microvessel density—
as measured by the tumor area occupied by endothelial cell
(CD31 or VE-cadherin)—was not affected by pan-Notch
inhibition (Fig. 2B; refs. 12–14). Analysis of smaller LLCVEGFA tumors at 6 days of growth when they reach a
palpable size also showed that the abundance of blood
vessels was not changed, suggesting that the absence of
aberrant sprouting in endothelial cell-Notch–inhibited (double Tg) animals is not related to a late tumor effect (Fig. 2C).
In addition, short induction of dnMAML-GFP expression for 16
hours (Tet pulse) did not affect the abundance of blood vessels
(Fig. 2C). Together, these results suggest that tumor growth
inhibition induced by speciﬁc endothelial Notch-inhibition in
VE-cadherin-tTA  TeTOS-dnMAML-GFP is independent of
the aberrant sprouting of the tumor vasculature.

Endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition reduces
functional vasculature
To determine whether Notch inhibition affects vascular
perfusion in this context, as described for Dll4 inhibition
(12–14), we analyzed the effect of blocking endothelial cell
Notch on blood vessel function. Concordant with studies
using Dll4 blockade, injection of the ﬂuorescent tracer
DioC7 intravenously showed reduced perfusion in tumors of
double Tg mice (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1). The
decrease in functional vasculature correlated signiﬁcantly with
increased expression of dnMAML-GFP in tumor blood vessels
(Fig. 3C).
Analysis of pericyte abundance in response to
endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition
Vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes control blood
ﬂow and previous studies have demonstrated the importance of Notch signaling in regulating these cells in tumor
and retinal angiogenesis (14, 15). However, staining of tumor
sections did not show a difference in immunostaining for the

pericyte marker Desmin between double Tg and control
mice (Fig. 4A and B). Furthermore, pericyte distribution
relative to endothelial cell was not different between control
and double Tg mice (Fig. 4C), and Desmin-positive cells were
closely opposed to dnMAML-GFP-expressing endothelial cell
(Fig. 4A inset), suggesting that the recruitment of pericytes to
blood vessels is not affected by endothelial cell Notch blockade.
The differentiation of pericytes, which impacts on the function
of blood vessels (29), was also similar in tumors of double Tg
versus control Tg mice as determined by the expression of early
(RGS5 and PDGFRb) and late (NG2, Desmin, and a-SMA)
markers of pericyte differentiation (Fig. 4D). In support of
this, ﬂow cytometry analysis showed similar abundance of
PDGFRbþ cells in LLC-VEGFA tumors of control Tg versus
double Tg (Supplementary Fig. S2). Together, these results
suggest that pericyte abundance, maturation, and recruitment
to endothelial cells are not responsible for the functional
vascular deﬁciency observed in response to blockade of endothelial Notch in tumor blood vessels.
Endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition reduces
functional vasculature and tumor growth through a NOdependent mechanism
We have recently shown that Notch is a regulator of eNOS
during cardiac cushion differentiation (9). We thus hypothe-

A

sized that the decrease of functional vasculature in double
Tg animals results from a defect of NO production. Initial
quantitative analysis from whole tumor sections showed no
signiﬁcant changes of activated eNOS (phospho-Ser1117) and
binding of the NO-speciﬁc probe DAR4M in LLC-VEGFA
tumors of double versus control Tg animals (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B). We hypothesized that inhibition of Notch
may have distinct effects in the production of NO in endothelial
cell of larger vessels compared with the microvasculature,
as NO would be expected to have a greater impact on
vasodilation of larger vessels because of the thicker perivascular wall comprising vascular smooth muscle cells. To
verify this hypothesis, cross-sections of larger tumor vessels
were quantiﬁed for activated eNOS and DAR4M (NO) retention. As expected, activation of eNOS and NO production
was reduced in tumors of larger vessels of double Tg mice
(Fig. 5A and B).
To further validate the role of NO in the vascular function
defect of double Tg mice, we performed a rescue experiment
with BAY41-2272, a NO-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Treatment with BAY41-2272 restored vascular
function in double Tg mice (Fig. 5C), supporting the thesis that
defective eNOS activation and consequent inhibition of NO
production is responsible for limiting vasodilation and tumor
perfusion in mice that have endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch

blockade. Treatment with BAY41-2272 also tended to rescue
the tumor growth in double Tg, although the difference
failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.08; Supplementary
Fig. S4). In addition, short induction of dnMAML-GFP expression for 16 hours (Tet removal) before tumor harvest also
decreased phospho-eNOS in larger vessels (Fig. 5D), indicating
that inhibition of eNOS activation is an early effect of Notch
inactivation in endothelial cell of larger vessels rather than a
secondary effect of tumor growth inhibition in double Tg
animals. Accordingly, treatment with the L-NIO, a potent eNOS
inhibitor (30), reduced LLC-VEGFA tumor growth (Fig. 5E).
Similar observations were obtained using a B16F10-VEGFA
tumor model (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, our
ﬁndings indicate that Notch inactivation-mediated inhibition
of eNOS activity results in vascular dysfunction in larger vessels
of the tumor vasculature affecting tumor growth. Our data
support other studies showing that eNOS inhibition using
genetic or pharmacologic strategies reduces tumor blood ﬂow
and growth (5–8, 31).
VEGFR2 positively regulates Notch-mediated NO
production
VEGFR2 is a major effector of VEGFA signaling (32, 33). To
assess the role of VEGFR2 signaling in Notch-mediated
production of NO in endothelial cell, we quantiﬁed DAR4M
staining in cocultures of HMEC overexpressing the Notch
ligand Jagged1 with HMEC parental cells (9) in the presence
of VEGFR2-speciﬁc inhibitor Ki8751 (21). As expected, in this
system NO production increased in HMEC-Jag1 cocultures
compared with HMEC-control vector cocultures (Fig. 6A and
B), and treatment with the VEGFR2 inhibitor Ki8751 reduced
Jag1-mediated NO stimulation (Fig. 6A and B). This ﬁnding
suggests that Notch is required for VEGFR2-induced NO
production in endothelial cell.
Expression analysis of genes involved in vascular tone
A recent study shows that Notch in endothelial cell
is important to control the expression of genes involved in
vasodilation/vasoconstriction (34). We thus determined
whether the expression of these genes is affected by endothelial
cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition in tumors. Interestingly, the
expression of the vasodilation genes Nts and Adm was
decreased in endothelial cell from LLC-VEGFA tumors of
double Tg (Supplementary Fig. S6), compatible with reduced

perfusion in the tumors of mice with endothelial cell–speciﬁc
Notch inhibition. In contrast, expression of other genes with
vasoactive function suggested to be affected by Notch were not
detectable in tumor endothelial cell, although present in the
bulk tumor population (Supplementary Table S1). These ﬁndings suggest that the gene expression program regulating
vasodilation is diminished in response to endothelial cell–
speciﬁc Notch inhibition.

Discussion
Although a better understanding of Notch function in the
microvasculature is being established, questions remain
about the mechanistic role of endothelial Notch in the tumor
vasculature. This study reveals that Notch signaling in
endothelial cell of larger vessels facilitates blood ﬂow by
increasing production of the vasodilatory agent NO. These
ﬁndings are compatible with previous studies showing that
eNOS-targeted mice exhibit reduced LLC tumor growth and
blood vessel permeability (8). Furthermore, our data suggest
a mechanism in which Notch induces endothelial NO in a
VEGFA–VEGFR2 axis-dependent manner. Elucidation of this
mechanism in this study stems from multiple observations
generated using various experimental strategies: (i) speciﬁc
inhibition of Notch in endothelial cell inhibits blood vessel
perfusion and tumor growth in experimental mouse tumor
models in which the tumor cells produce VEGFA; (ii) NO
production and activated eNOS activity is rapidly decreased
in larger vessels in response to endothelial cell–speciﬁc
Notch inhibition; (iii) activation of the NO receptors gastric
cancer with the vasodilation agent BAY41-2272 rescues
vascular function defects induced by endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition; (iv) speciﬁc pharmacologic inhibition
of VEGFR2 blocks Notch-mediated NO production in endothelial cell; and (v) endothelial cell–speciﬁc Notch inhibition
reduces the expression of Nts and Adm, 2 genes that simulate
vasodilation.
Our observations that inhibition of Notch in endothelial
cell decreases tumor perfusion as well the expression of
vasodilatory genes Nts and Adm is at odds with a previous
study showing that Dll4-mediated Notch signaling induces
the expression of vasoconstrictor genes, and diminishes
vasodilator gene expression (34). The nature of this discrepancy is not clear, but may be because of the different models
of vascular development, that is, tumor vasculature in this

antibody against eNOS phospho-Ser1177. Quantiﬁcation was performed on microvasculature and cross-sections from mural cell-invested blood vessels,
which have larger lumina than capillaries and thus are more dependent on mural cell vasorelaxation as described in Materials and Methods (control
Tg, n ¼ 6; double Tg, n ¼ 9). B, the micrographs show that larger tumor blood vessels in double Tg animals produce less NO (DAR4M). DiOC7 and immunostaining
of GFP was used to analyze vascular perfusion and dnMAML-GFP expression, respectively, of tumor blood vessel cross-sections from control and double
Tg animals. Scale bar, 100 mm. C, the NO-independent soluble guanylyl cyclase (NO receptor) agonist BAY41-2272 rescues vascular function in tumors grown in
double Tg mice (n ¼ 6). BAY42-2272 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) was injected intraperitoneally at day 8, 10, and 12 posttumor implantation and DilC18
was injected by tail vein before killing the mice to analyze vascular function. The graph shows the % area of tumor section covered by DilC18 dye (control Tg,
n ¼ 24; double Tg, n ¼ 24). The micrographs show representative CD31 and DilC18 staining from control and double Tg mice used for analysis in C. D, the decrease
of eNOS activation is an early effect of endothelial Notch inhibition. Tumors were grown for 8 days in the presence of Dox followed by 5 days treatment
with Tet, which was then withdrawn for the last 16 hours of tumor growth to induce a short pulse of dnMAML-GFP expression. The graph shows the proportion of

study versus retinal angiogenesis during development. In
line with this supposition, tumor blood vessels are known to
behave aberrantly and are notably more tortuous and leaky
than vessels from normal vascular remodeling tissues such
as the developing retina (32). Moreover, the genetic model
used in our study to induce pan-Notch inhibition in endothelial cell versus Dll4 blockers used in the study of Lobov
and colleagues (34) could also account for the difference
observed in the 2 studies. Finally, we speciﬁcally sorted
endothelial cells to examine expression, whereas the previous study examined the entire retinal tissue, which includes
a variety of cell types.

The observation that endothelial-speciﬁc Notch inhibition
does not induce sprouting angiogenesis defects in this study
could be a consequence of Notch activation signals that have
opposing effects during sprouting angiogenesisas seen with
the distinct outcomes resulting from targeting Dll4 or Jagged1 (15). Interestingly, Jagged1 was shown to block Dll4mediated Notch activation (15). Indeed, the observation that
Jagged1 can also induce Notch target genes in the context of
low Fringe expression (15) and during tumor neovascularization (35) raises the question whether Jagged1 (or Notch
ligands other than Dll4) can also inhibit sprouting angiogenesis by inducing Notch activation signaling in a speciﬁc
subset of endothelial cell of the nascent blood vessels. It is
also possible that the strength of the Notch signal may
activate different signaling pathways that have different
functional effects during tumor angiogenesis. A recent study
demonstrated this dose-dependence of Notch signaling for
endocrine progenitors in the zebraﬁsh intrapancreatic duct
(36). Future studies in transgenic expression systems allowing dynamic assessment of Notch activity during tumor
neovascularization will be needed to investigate these
important questions.
A previous study has reported that NO production is important for recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells and
pericytes in tumors (4). In this study we did not ﬁnd that the
abundance of these perivascular cells was affected by Notch
inhibition-mediated reduction of NO. The nature of this discrepancy could be explained by the increase of VEGFA signaling in LLC-VEGFA tumors. Indeed, VEGFA has been shown to
reduce recruitment of pericytes (37) and thus high VEGFAexpressing tumors may be less sensitive to NO-dependent
pericyte recruitment.
In conclusion, our study reveals that Notch activates the
production of the vasorelaxing agent NO in endothelial cell of
tumor vasculature, which is important for blood vessel function and consequently tumor growth.
