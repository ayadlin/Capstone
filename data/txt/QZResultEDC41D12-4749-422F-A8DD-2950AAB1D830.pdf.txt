ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a serious life-threatening malignancy.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Gefitinib
and Erlotinib, are effective clinical medicines for advanced NSCLC patients harboring
EGFR-activating mutations. However, this therapy just benefits a small percentage of
sufferers. Worse still, all patients treated with drugs ultimately develop resistance.
Hence, there is still an unmet medical need among patients with NSCLC. In this
account, we report a novel multikinase inhibitor SKLB-178, which potently inhibits
both EGFR-activating and resistant mutations, as well as the activities of Src and
VEGFR2 kinases. SKLB-178 potently inhibited cancer cell growth in both Gefitinibsensitive and resistant NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, SKLB-178 significantly suppressed
the migration, invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells, and the growth of
intersegmental vessel in zebrafish. The in vivo pharmacodynamic studies further
demonstrated that SKLB-178 had wider potency than Gefitinib, and could significantly
prolong survival of animals in A549 experimental metastasis model. These advantages
together with the low toxicity of SKLB-178 indicate that SKLB-178 deserves to be
further developed as a potential drug candidate for NSCLC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

21 L858R mutation, and EGFR amplification [3–5]. It
has successfully launched a new era of NSCLC therapy.
Nevertheless, this therapy just benefits a sub set of NSCLC
patients [6]. Furthermore, all sufferers treated with drugs
ultimately develop resistance [7–9]. These disadvantages
seriously restrict the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in clinic.
Therefore, development of novel anti-NSCLC medicines
with broad activity and capability to overcome Gefitinib
resistance is still strongly demanded.
NSCLC is a highly heterogeneous disease with multifactorial pathological signatures. There is multiple crossstimulation among targets along several pathways of signal
transduction that result in malignancy of NSCLC. Therefore,

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung
cancer cases. Molecular targeted therapy is considered a
more promising strategy for the treatment of advanced
NSCLC compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, given
its relatively high efficiency and weak side effect [1, 2].
Gefitinib, a first generation small-molecule epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, is highly active
in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR-activating mutations
including exon 19 deletion (E746-A750) mutation, exon

agents targeting multiple tumor-associated pathways may be
expected to benefit the clinical therapeutic effect of NSCLC
[10, 11]. Among targets associated with NSCLC, EGFR
is a well characterized mutated oncogene, and undisputed
the preferred therapeutic target [3, 12]. Moreover, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src is a promising target for cancer
therapy, as inhibition of Src leads to suppression of multiple
oncogenic pathways including PI3K/Akt, Ras/Raf/MAPK,
JAK/Stats and SFK/FAK/p130CAS cascades [13, 14].
Numerous studies have shown that aberrant Src activation
is implicated in the development, metastasis and even
resistance of NSCLC [15–19]. Src inhibitors could improve
the efficacy of some molecular targeted drugs and cytotoxic
agents for NSCLC therapy in preclinical studies [20, 21].
Hence, inhibition of Src activity may be of particular
clinical interest in the treatment of NSCLC. In addition,
accumulating evidence from the literature indicates that
anti-angiogenic therapy is a well-established and effective
strategy for the treatment of solid tumors [22–24]. NSCLC
is also a highly vascular tumor, and numerous angiogenesis
inhibitors have been tested clinically for NSCLC therapy
[25–28]. Thus, targeting angiogenesis- associated
targets, especially VEGFR2 which plays a pivotal role in
pathological angiogenesis, is also a particularly attractive
therapeutic approach for NSCLC.
In this account, we report a novel multikinase
inhibitor SKLB-178, which efficaciously inhibits both
EGFR-activating and resistant mutations, as well as
the activities of Src and VEGFR2 kinases. SKLB-178
potently inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and induced
apoptosis in cellular assays. Meanwhile, SKLB-178
could significantly suppress the migration, invasion and
tube formation of endothelial cells, and the growth of
intersegmental blood vessel in zebrafish. The in vivo
pharmacodynamic studies further demonstrated that SKLB178 had wider potency compared with Gefitinib, and could
exert its anti-NSCLC activity directly by suppression of
tumor cell growth and indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis.
Furthermore, treatment with SKLB-178 led to a significant
improvement in survival in A549 experimental metastasis
model. These advantages together with the low toxicity of
SKLB-178 indicate that SKLB-178 is a promising drug
candidate for NSCLC therapy.

at 1 μM (100% inhibition rate). Additionally, SKLB-178
exhibited a relatively low inhibitory rate of 10%, 0%, 1%,
0%, 0%, 27%, 2%, and 0% against FAK, FGFR1, MEK,
MKK4, mTOR, PDGFRβ, PI3K, and PLK1, respectively,
at 10 μM. Similarly, SKLB-178 just inhibited the activities
of IGF-1R, PDGFRα, and Syk by 11%, 58%, and 28%,
respectively, at 1 μM. Taken together, these results
indicated that SKLB-178 was a multikinase inhibitor
mainly targeting EGFR mutations, Src, and VEGFR2.

SKLB-178 inhibits NSCLC cell viability and
proliferation in vitro
The anti-viability activity of SKLB-178 was tested
in a panel of 13 NSCLC cell lines using MTT assay.
SKLB-178 could potently inhibit the viability of HCC827,
PC-9, HCC4006, H292, A549, H358, H1975, H441,
H1993, H820, and H460, with IC50 values of less than
2 μM, exhibiting a wider range of activity than Gefitinib
(Figure 1B). Three typical NSCLC cell lines HCC827
(EGFRdelE746-A750), H1975 (EGFRL858R/T790M) and A549
(KRASG12S) were selected for further comparative studies.
As denoted in Figure 1C, SKLB-178 showed comparable
anti-viability activity compared with Gefitinib on Gefitinibsensitive HCC827 cells, the corresponding IC50 values
for SKLB-178 and Gefitinib were 2.5 nM and 1.6 nM,
respectively. Meanwhile, SKLB-178 efficiently inhibited
the viability of Gefitinib-resistant H1975 and A549 cells,
with IC50 values of 1.1 μM and 0.58 μM, respectively.
As a positive control for EGFR gatekeeper mutation, the
covalent inhibitor Afatinib exhibited strong inhibitory
effects on EGFR-mutant cells, but showed weaker antiviability activity than SKLB-178 on A549 cells.
To complement the results from short-term
treatments, long-term colony formation assay was
then performed to assess the cytoreductive activity of
SKLB-178. As shown in Figure 1D, SKLB-178 dosedependently decreased the formation of colonies in all of
the three NSCLC cell lines, while Gefitinib significantly
reduced colonies of HCC827 cell line. The similar results
were also observed in EdU cell proliferation assay. Both
SKLB-178 and Gefitinib markedly reduced the number of
proliferating HCC827 cells (red nuclei), but only SKLB178 had significant anti-proliferation effects on H1975 and
A549 cells (Figure 1E). To sum up, these data indicated
that SKLB-178 had efficacies of anti-viability and antiproliferation on both Gefitinib-sensitive and resistant
NSCLC cells, showing a wider potency than Gefitinib .

RESULTS
Kinase inhibition activity of SKLB-178
The kinase inhibition potency of SKLB-178
was measured using the gold-standard 33P radiolabeled
technology. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, SKLB178 completely inhibited the activities of EGFR, EGFR
L858R mutation, EGFR L858R/T790M mutation, KDR
(VEGFR2), and Src either at 10 μM or at a lower dose of
1 μM. SKLB-178 also showed inhibitory activity against
MET kinase at 10 μM (88% inhibition rate), and ErbB4

than 10 nM (Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained
after treatment with Gefitinib, and the percentage of cells
in G0/G1 phase was increased from 56.02% to 93.42% and
93.81% for SKLB-178 (100 nM) and Gefitinib (100 nM),
respectively. In H1975 and A549 cells, SKLB-178 also led
to accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent
manner, however, Gefitinib at the concentration of 10 μM
just had a slight effect on cell-cycle arrest (Figure 2A).
The NSCLC cells PC-9 (harboring the same EGFRactivating mutation as HCC827) and H1975 were used for
cell apoptosis analysis. Exposure of both cells to SKLB178 for 24 h resulted in obvious increases of Annexin
V-positive populations in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2B), demonstrating that SKLB-178
had strong effect on inducing apoptosis. By contrast,
Gefitinib could also induce apoptosis in PC-9 cells at a
concentration of 1 μM, however, the apoptotic rate of
Gefitinib-treated H1975 cells showed no significant
difference compared with vehicle (Figure 2B). Taken
together, SKLB-178 could effectively induce cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells, no matter they are
sensitive or resistant to Gefitinib.

invasion and tube formation are all pivotal steps. We
carried out wound healing assay to evaluate the inhibitory
effect of SKLB-178 on endothelial cells migration. As
indicated in Figure 4A, the number of migrating cells
was significantly diminished by SKLB-178 (1 μM) as
compared with vehicle. In transwell invasion assay, SKLB178 strongly inhibited HUVEC invasion at a concentration
of 1 μM. The similar effect was also observed in Matrigelbased tube formation assay, in which the ability of
HUVEC assembling into branched capillary-like structure
was also effectively depressed by 1 μM SKLB-178. The
ability of SKLB-178 to inhibit the VEGFR signaling was
further assessed in HUVEC. As the Figure 4B shows,
VEGFR2 (KDR) and its downstream signaling molecule
ERK were activated upon stimulation by VEGF, while this
activation could be intensively suppressed by SKLB-178
at concentrations higher than 0.3 μM.
To further test the antiangiogenic effect of
SKLB-178 in vivo, transgenic zebrafish assay was adopted
for assessment. As shown in Figure 4C, SKLB-178 at a
concentration of 1 μM could partly inhibit the growth
of zebrafish intersegmental blood vessels, and 3 μM
SKLB-178 led to almost complete blockade of the
intersegmental vessel formation. The antiangiogenic
activity of SKLB-178 was comparable to that of the
positive control Sorafenib. All of these results revealed
that SKLB-178 could efficiently restrain angiogenesis in
vitro and in vivo mainly through suppression of VEGFR
signaling pathway.

Targeting of multiple signaling pathways by
SKLB-178 in NSCLC cells
Western blot analysis was performed to assess
the ability of SKLB-178 in the blockade of EGFR and Src
signaling pathways. In HCC827 cells, SKLB-178 potently
inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, and the downstream
signaling proteins Akt and ERK at concentrations higher
than 0.1 μM (Figure 3A). Similar effects were also
observed in cells treated by Gefitinib (1 μM). In the
EGF-stimulated H1975 cells, SKLB-178 restrained EGFdependent phosphorylation of EGFR, Akt, and ERK in
a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated IC50 value
of 1 μM (Figure 3B). In contrast, the EGFR signaling
in H1975 cells was not significantly inhibited by either
Gefitinib or Vandetanib at the concentration of 10 μM
(Figure 3B). The inhibitory activity of SKLB-178 against
Src and its downstream pivotal proteins was determined in
A549 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, Src phosphorylation
was significantly blocked at concentrations higher than
1 μM. The downtream kinases including FAK, Stat3,
Akt, and ERK were also dose-dependently inhibited with
IC50 values between 0.3 and 1 μM, while Gefitinib had
little inhibition effect against Src cascades even at 10 μM
concentration. Collectively, these results suggested that
SKLB-178 was a multikinase inhibitor, and inhibited the
growth of NSCLC cells mainly through suppression of
EGFR and Src signalings.

Antitumor efficacy and mechanisms of action of
SKLB-178 in human NSCLC xenograft models
The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of SKLB-178 was
assessed in HCC827, H292, H1975, A549, H1993 and Calu6 tumor xenograft models. Once daily oral administration of
SKLB-178 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth in all models examined (Figure 5B). Full growth
inhibition profiles are shown for four typical xenograft
models (Figure 5A). Among them, HCC827 and H292
models were sensitive to EGFR inhibitor. Both SKLB-178
and Gefitinib could result in tumor regression in these two
models at middle and high doses (Figure 5A). In Gefitinibresistant H1975 model, SKLB-178 was still able to suppress
the growth of tumor efficaciously, and the anti-tumor
activity of SKLB-178 at the high dose (150 mg/kg) was
similar to that obtained with the positive control Afatinib
(20 mg/kg). Specifically, TGI values were 83.48% and
83.31%, respectively (Figure 5B). Moreover, Sorafenib,
an angiogenesis inhibitor, also exhibited a moderate tumor
inhibitory activity in H1975 model, with tumor growth
inhibition rate of 66.42% at 100 mg/kg. In the A549
xenograft model, oral administrations of SKLB-178 at 100
and 150 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent
manner at rates of 62.16% and 76.95%, respectively (Figure
5B). However, treatment with Gefitinib at 100 mg/kg

produced only a marginal effect on tumor growth. Of note,
when compared with the vehicle group, severe weight loss
and pathological changes of major organs were not observed
in SKLB-178-treated animals even at a high dose of 150 mg/
kg (Figure 5A and 5C), indicating the low toxicity of SKLB178. By comparison, the weight of mice treated by Afatinib
fluctuated remarkably, demonstrating potential side effects
of this agent. Collectively, these results showed that SKLB178 was efficacious and well tolerated in NSCLC xenograft
models, and had broader anti-NSCLC activity than Gefitinib.
To elucidate the mechanisms of action of
SKLB-178-mediated anti-tumor effects in vivo,
immunohistochemical staining assays were carried out on
the tumor tissues. As indicated in Supplementary Figure
S1, SKLB-178 potently inhibited the phosphorylation
levels of EGFR and Src just as depicted in in vitro assays,
leading to a significant decrease in proliferating tumor
cells (Ki67-positive cells) and substantial increase in
apoptotic cells (TUNEL-positive cells) compared with
the corresponding control in HCC827 and A549 models
(Figure 5D and 5E). The anti-proliferation effect of SKLB178 was also detected in H1975 xenograft model, but not
in Calu-6 model (Figure 5D). In addition, SKLB-178 also
exhibited effective anti-angiogenesis activity in vivo, and
a significantly reduced microvessel density was observed
in the SKLB-178-treated tumors (Figure 5F). Taken
together, these results demonstrated that SKLB-178 could
still inhibit specific targets in vivo, and exert its anti-tumor

effects through inhibition of proliferation and induction of
apoptosis, as well as restraining angiogenesis.

Antimetastatic activity of  SKLB-178
We ulteriorly assessed the effect of SKLB-178 on
the metastasis-associated survival by injecting A549
cells via tail vein in BALB/c nude mice. As shown in
Figure 6A, the mean survival time (MST) was 72.2 days
in vehicle treatment group, with all mice expired by day
76. SKLB-178 treatment significantly prolonged survival
of animals, and metastasis-related mortality just occurred
at day 104 and 115. There were still 3 mice alive even at
the end of the experiment (day 150). In contrast, the mean
survival time of mice in Gefitinib and Sorafenib treatment
group were 96 days and 101.8 days, respectively,
indicating a weaker antimetastatic activity compared
with SKLB-178. Additionally, histological anatomy
of dead animals demonstrated that they all died of lung
metastases (marked by white arrow) (Figure 6B). H&E
staining further confirmed that the dead mice developed
macrometastasis in the lungs (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
The EGFR family, also known as the ErbB/HER
family, is a group of receptor tyrosine kinases implicated
in the development of cancer, especially NSCLC. Src is

known to be both downstream transducer and upstream
activator of EGFR. It can be activated by EGFR, and also
transactivate EGFR by phosphorylating tyrosine residue
Y845 [29, 30]. They have synergistic functions. As many
tumors overexpress both EGFR and Src, it is reasonable to
infer that inhibition of both targets may be beneficial for
cancer therapy. Furthermore, VEGFR and EGFR share
common downstream signalings, and have direct and

indirect auxo-action on the development of tumor and
angiogenesis [11, 31, 32]. Combined inhibition of EGFR
and VEGFR signaling pathways has been proven effective
in the treatment of NSCLC [11, 33]. Hence, synergistic
targeting of these targets mentioned above may be beneficial
for NSCLC therapy. SKLB-178 reported in this account
is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor with inhibitory
potency against EGFR, Src, and VEGFR2 kinases.

There are at least two advantages of SKLB-178 in
the treatment of NSCLC. The first one is its inhibitory
potency against both EGFR-activating mutations and
EGFR gatekeeper mutation (T790M). The latter is the
main acquired resistance mutation to Gefitinib, and
accounts for up to 50% of all resistant cases [7, 34]. Thus,
SKLB-178 can effectively restrain the proliferation of
both HCC827 (harboring EGFR-activating mutation)
and H1975 (harboring EGFR T790M mutation) in vitro
and in vivo. The second one is that SKLB-178 can not
only inhibit the growth of tumor cells, but also block
tumor angiogenesis. This could be used to interpret why
SKLB-178 shows weaker anti-viability activity against
H1975 cells compared with the positive control Afatinib
in vitro, but could achieve comparable anti-tumor potency
in H1975 xenograft model. This is also the main reason
why SKLB-178 significantly prolongs survival compared
with either EGFR inhibitor or angiogenesis inhibitor in the
experimental metastasis model.
Another attractive point of SKLB-178 is its antiproliferation effect in some KRAS mutant cells. KRAS
is a most frequently mutated oncogene causing NSCLC
patients resistant to Gefitinib. It has been one of the most
powerful predictive markers for resistance to EGFR
inhibitors [35, 36]. However, due to the complexity of
KRAS signaling, there are still many challenges for

therapeutic targeting. Recent studies have demonstrated
that Src is a potential target for the treatment of KRAS
mutant tumors [37, 38], and targeting Src with the pan
SFK inhibitor Dasatinib could sensitize some KRAS
mutant tumors to Cetuximab [39]. On the basis of the
previous studies between KRAS and Src, the potency of
SKLB-178 against some KRAS mutant NSCLC cells,
especially A549 (KRASG12S), may be mainly attributed to
its inhibitory activity against Src kinase.
In summary, SKLB-178 is a compound that combines
inhibition of EGFR-activating and resistant mutations,
as well as Src and VEGFR2 kinases in one molecule. It
effectually inhibited tumor cell growth and angiogenesis
both in vitro and in vivo, exhibiting broad anti-NSCLC
activity in preclinical pharmacodynamic study. SKLB178 has the convenience of oral administration, and is well
tolerated. Taken together, SKLB-178 deserves to be further
developed as a potential drug candidate for NSCLC therapy.

obtained from commercial source. All of the compounds
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the
final concentration of DMSO in the incubation mixture
did not exceed 0.1% (v/v) in each experiment in vitro.
Human NSCLC cell lines were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and
National Platform of Experimental Cell Resources for
Sci-Tech (China). All tumor cell lines were cultured
according to standard procedures and passaged for less
than 6 months after receipt for resuscitation. Human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) was isolated
from human umbilical cord veins and grown in EGM-2
medium (Millipore, USA). HUVECs at passage 2–6 were
used for all studies.

profiles were determined by flow cytometry (Becton
Dicknson, USA) and analyzed using the ModFit LT 3.2
software (Verity Software House, USA). For apoptosis
analysis, cells were detremined using the Annexin
V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (KeyGEN Bio TECH,
China) following the manufacturer’s instruction.

Wound healing assay
Cells were cultured to confluence in 24-well plates
and wounded by scratching with a 200-μL sterilized
pipette tip, followed by treatment with vehicle or 1 μM
SKLB-178 for 20 h. Pictures were taken under an
OLYMPUS light microscope.

Transwell invasion assay

Kinase inhibition assay

The Transwell compartments (Millipore, USA)
were inserted into a 24-well plate and pre-coated with
50 μL diluted Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA). HUVECs
were suspended in EBM-2 medium and seeded in the
upper chamber, followed by treatment with vehicle or
1 μM SKLB-178. EGM-2 medium (EBM-2 medium
supplemented with various growth factors) was added to
the lower chamber, and then cells were allowed to migrate
for 24 h at 37°C. The migrated cells were stained with
0.05% crystal violet (w/v) and photographed using a light
microscope (Leica, Germany).

Kinase inhibition assay was conducted by
KinaseProfiler service provided by Millipore as described
previously [40].

Cell viability was measured using MTT assay.
Cells growing in 96-well plates were treated with DMSO
control or the indicated compounds for 72 h. 20 μL of
MTT solution (5 mg/mL, Sigma, USA) was then added to
each well, and the plates were incubated for another 4 h at
37°C. The formazan crystals were dissolved with acidified
SDS (20%, w/v) overnight, and absorbance was detected
at 570 nm on Multiskan MK3 (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Tube formation assay
The tube formation assay was conducted as
described previously [41]. In Brief, 50 μL per well of
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) was added to the 96well plate and allowed to solidify at 37°C for 30 min.
HUVECs were then seeded on the Matrigel and cultured in
the presence of vehicle or SKLB-178 (1 μM). Cells were
photographed with an OLYMPUS digital camera 6 h later.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a concentration
of 5,000 cells per well, and cultured in the presence of
agents for 10 days. At the end of incubation, cells were
fixed with methanol for 15 min, followed by staining with
crystal violet (0.05%, w/v) for another 15 min.

Zebrafish

EdU cell proliferation assay

Anti-angiogenesis effect of SKLB-178 and
Sorafenib was assessed in transgenic zebrafish (FLK-1:
EGFP) following the protocol reported previously [42].
Briefly, zebrafish embryos were incubated with vehicle,
SKLB-178 or Sorafenib from 15 h postfertilization
(hpf) until 31 hpf. Then zebrafish were anesthetized and
imaged under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging, Germany).

Cells growing in 96-well plates were cultured in the
presence of different concentrations of agents for 24 h.
Cell proliferation was determined by EdU incorporation
assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol (RIBOBIO,
China). The images were captured by ArrayScan VTI HCS
reader (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis
analysis

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime, China)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell extracts
were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore,
USA), followed by immunoblot with antibodies. All

Cells were treated with vehicle or agents for 24 h
and harvested. For cell cycle analysis, cells were incubated
with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide, 100 μg/mL RNase and
0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min in the dark. The cell cycle

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Xenograft studies

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

All animal studies carried out were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University
(Chengdu, Sichuan, China). Tumor xenograft models were
established by subcutaneously injecting 5 × 106 tumor
cells into the hind flank region of BALB/c nude mice.
After tumor development, mice were randomized (n = 6
each), and drugs were administered orally once daily.
Tween-80 (0.1%, v/v) was used as vehicle. Tumor sizes
were measured every 3 days with caliper, and the volume
was calculated as length × width2 × 0.5. Inhibition rate of
tumor growth was calculated using the following formula:
100 × {1 - [(tumor volumefinal - tumor volumeinitial) for the
compound-treated group] / [(tumor volumefinal - tumor
volumeinitial) for the vehicle- treated group]}.
For the metastasis study, A549 cells (1 × 106) were
injected into female BALB/c nude mice via tail vein, and
the animals were immediately divided into four groups:
0.1% tween-80 as vehicle control, 100 mg/kg SKLB-178
treatment group, 100 mg/kg Gefitinib treatment group,
and 100 mg/kg Sorafenib group. Drugs and vehicle were
administrated orally once a day for 50 days. Survival was
determined by observation when the animals became
moribund.

H&E and immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissues and organs were dissected from the
sacrificed BALB/c athymic mice after treatment with
SKLB-178 for the indicated time. Paraffin-embedded
sections of the major organs and tumors were stained
with H&E according to the standard protocols. Frozen
or paraffin-embedded tumors were subjected to
immunostaining with p-EGFR, p-Src, Ki67, TUNEL,
or CD31 antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology or
Abcam. The representative images were taken under a
light microscope (Leica, Germany).
