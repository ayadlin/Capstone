BACKGROUND: Sunitinib malate is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is active against many tyrosine
kinase receptors involving crucial pathways in both healthy tissues and malignant tissues. Because its use in clinical
practice is quite recent, many of its possible side effects remain unknown. In this report, the authors describe the incidence of new-onset hyperparathyroidism in a cohort of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received
treatment with sunitinib. METHODS: Twenty-six patients who received first-line sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma were enrolled in this study for a mineral and parathyroid function assessment. Plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone; serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 1,25-dihydrovitamin D3; and urinary
24-hour calcium and phosphorus excretion all were measured in each patient. Biochemical evaluations were performed before the beginning of treatment and at the end of each sunitinib treatment period. RESULTS: Eighteen of
26 patients (69.2%) developed hyperparathyroidism with normal serum calcium levels, and 6 of them developed
hypophosphatemia. Patients presented with a mean elevation of parathyroid hormone after 2.2 cycles of sunitinib.
The levels of 25-OH vitamin D3 were stable over the course of treatment, whereas 1,25-OH vitamin D3 levels were
increased in 5 hyperparathyroid patients. Those who presenting with elevated parathyroid hormone levels had low or
undetectable urinary calcium levels. Parathyroid hormone elevation usually persisted but did not progress during
long-term therapy with sunitinib. Permanent treatment interruption resulted in a resolution of hyperparathyroidism.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperparathyroidism developed in an high percentage of patients on sunitinib. Therefore, the
authors concluded that sunitinib may affect parathyroid function and bone mineral homeostasis, possibly resulting in

INTRODUCTION
Sunitinib malate (Sutent; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is an orally bioavailable, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) currently approved for the treatment of imatinib-intolerant or refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). To date, this molecule has demonstrated the ability to inhibit vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) receptors (PDGFR-a and PDGFR-b), stem cell growth factor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), colony-stimulating
factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET).1
Like other TKIs, sunitinib was modeled specifically to target the activity of only selected enzymes. However, many
off-target kinases are targets of this drug, resulting in unexpected side effects. Moreover, VEGF, PDGF, and other pathways that are inhibited selectively by sunitinib are expressed in healthy tissue, in which they play a critical role in cell differentiation and survival; their pharmacologic inhibition is related to some sunitinib-induced adverse events. Therefore,
considering the extremely wide range of signaling pathways inhibited by sunitinib, widespread toxicities would be
expected during sunitinib administration. Nonetheless, it is usually well tolerated with minor or moderate toxicities.
Several studies have attributed many side effects of sunitinib to the inhibition of its molecular targets in healthy tissue, including hypertension, hemorrhages, anemia or other disorders involving blood cells, cardiotoxicity, hand-foot syndrome, and mucosal inflammation.2,3 To our knowledge, the effects of sunitinib on bones have not been described.

However, a reduction in serum phosphate levels was
reported among patients who were receiving sunitinib,
suggesting the possible dysregulation of mineral metabolism and, more extensively, of bone homeostasis.2,4
Since 2007, we have observed an unexpected elevation of intact plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) in
some patients on sunitinib. All of these patients were
receiving sunitinib for mRCC. These findings prompted
us to prospectively evaluate parathyroid and mineral metabolism parameters among patients who received firstline sunitinib to assess a possible relation between the
drug and phosphorus and calcium homeostasis. In this article, we report the results of our evaluation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between May 2007 and December 2010, 26 patients who
were admitted consecutively to our department, all of
whom were affected by mRCC with a clear cell histology,
were evaluated prospectively and observed. Fifteen
patients were men, and 11 patients were women. The median patient age was 63.9 years (range, 50-85 years; median age: men, 61.9 years; women, 66.6 years [all
postmenopausal]). At the time of diagnosis 22 patients
had undergone nephrectomy or nephron-sparing surgery
for RCC. The other remaining 4 patients did not undergo
surgery because of the extent of malignant tissue and the
presence of contraindications. In these patients, the histologic diagnosis of RCC was established by fine-needle biopsy of the renal mass or metastases. The characteristics of
all patients are reported in Table 1.
All patients received front-line therapy with sunitinib 50 mg daily according to a classic 6-week schedule (4
weeks of daily 50 mg administration [ON] followed by 2
weeks of rest [OFF]). Depending on toxicities, treatment
interruptions or dose adjustments were performed according to manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. Patients had no
food or medical restrictions, and medications other than
sunitinib were not standardized. When patients were
receiving sunitinib, vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate
supplements were not allowed. Patients who did not
receive sunitinib for at least 12 weeks because of disease
progression or toxicity were excluded from the analysis.
Four patients presented with bone metastatic disease.
Because of the presence of limited bone involvement and
contraindications, 2 of these patients did not receive
bisphosphonate therapy. Each of the other 2 patients
underwent surgical excision of a single bone metastasis
before starting sunitinib because of the high risk of frac-

ture, and these patients did not receive bisphosphonate
therapy while they were receiving sunitinib.
At baseline, all patients presented with adequate renal function, with an average serum creatinine level of
1.19 mg/dL (range, 0.59-1.68 mg/dL; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.15 mg/dL). All patients provided fasting
serum and plasma samples as well as urine samples from a
24-hour collection to perform biochemistry measurements; and all patients had an intact PTH plasma assessment at baseline and in last week of each sunitinib
administration cycle. Creatinine, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and serum and urinary phosphate and calcium levels also were measured within 1
month before the beginning of treatment. Blood tests
were repeated at the end of each sunitinib ON period
(between days 22 and 28 of a 6-week cycle). Urinary calcium and phosphate levels (expressed as 24-hour excretion) were measured for each patient every 3 months or as
soon as plasma PTH values increased above the upper laboratory range. All patients provided informed written
consent before the beginning of the study.
These analysis were performed at our university hospital in the same laboratory. Serum and urinary samples
were collected, handled, and analyzed according to internal standard operating procedures. Measurements were
performed in accordance with international standardized
methods. Our laboratory reference ranges are 1.3 to 7.6
pmol/mL for PTH, 8.2 to 10.7 mg/dL for serum calcium,
2.5 to 5 mg/dL for serum phosphate, 100 to 300 mg/24

30 and 100 ng/mL is considered normal, whereas <10
ng/mL is considered a severe impairment.
The primary objective of this study was an assessment of parathyroid function and bone mineral metabolism abnormalities among patients who were receiving
sunitinib for mRCC. The data are summarized descriptively as frequency counts, means, and ranges. Both absolute and relative changes in biochemical parameters
during treatment and at the end of treatment were analyzed. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value < .05
was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
All 26 patients who received sunitinib were eligible for
evaluation. The mean treatment duration was 7.2 sixweek cycles and ranged from 2 cycles to 22.5 cycles. All
patients had adequate renal function at baseline, and creTable 2. Baseline Biochemical Characteristics of the Study

atinine variations during treatment were not significant
(P > .05). Plasma PTH levels and urinary and serum calcium and phosphorus levels were within normal range
before the beginning of sunitinib administration in all enrolled patients. Baseline biochemical data are summarized
in Table 2.
During sunitinib administration, an increase above
the upper limit of plasma PTH was observed in 18 of 26
patients (69.2%), although serum calcium levels remained
stable during treatment. On average, an increased in PTH
developed after 2.2 complete sunitinib administration
cycles (range, 1-6 cycles); whereas, in 9 patients, an
increase in PTH already was observed within the first
cycle of sunitinib. Once the PTH level increased, it
resulted stable during treatment. Moreover, we did not
observe a significant reduction in plasma PTH during
sunitinib OFF periods.
In the patients who developed hyperparathyroidism,
PTH serum levels also were measured after sunitinib was
discontinued because of disease progression or toxicity. It
is noteworthy that PTH levels progressively returned to
the normal range within 2 to 4 months after sunitinib
interruption (Fig. 1). This was observed in all 18 patients
who developed hyperparathyroidism during sunitinib
administration.
While patients were receiving sunitinib, PTH levels
were elevated compared with baseline. The mean PTH
level was 5.91 pmol/L at baseline (95% CI, 13.3 pmol/
L), 105.5 pmol/L in the first cycle (95% CI, 15.6 pmol/

Figure 2. This chart illustrates mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (in pmol/L), serum calcium levels (in mg/dl), and phosphorus levels (in mg/dl) for the entire study cohort of 26 patients. The PTH level rapidly increases above the laboratory reference
range then remains stable over time. It is noteworthy that the serum calcium level remains stable within the laboratory reference
range despite PTH elevation. Also note that, during the period analyzed, the number of patients on sunitinib decreased, and the
mean values reported here are related to a smaller sample of patients.

the sixth cycle (95% CI, 19.9 pmol/L; change from
baseline, Ã¾140.06%; P Â¼ .004) (Fig. 2). We observed a
mean PTH maximal increase of 152% compared with the
baseline level (P < .001).
Unexpectedly, serum calcium levels were within the
laboratory range, as mentioned above; whereas serum
phosphate levels were slightly reduced (mean serum calcium, 9.48 mg/dL at baseline; mean serum phosphate,
2.88 mg/dL at baseline; mean serum calcium range, 9.129.53 mg/dL during sunitinib administration; mean serum
phosphate range, 2.15-3.25 mg/dL during sunitinib
administration) (Fig. 2). In particular, hypophosphatemia
was observed in 6 patients, including 3 who did not develop a hyperparathyroid state. To assess a possible elevation of serum ionized calcium, this was measured
randomly in some hyperparathyroid patients and was
always within the reference range.
At baseline, in accordance with observations reported
from the general population,5 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were in the range of inadequacy (mean, 15.25 ng/mL)
and major variations during sunitinib administration were
not reported. Conversely, we observed an increase from
baseline 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels in some patients
who developed a hyperparathyroid state (mean 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at baseline, 46.16 pg/mL; mean 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 on sunitinib, 60.3 pg/mL; P > .05).
In particular, 5 of 18 patients (27.7%) developed an
increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 above the
laboratory reference range, which was an expected consequence of increased PTH.
Each patient had urinary calcium excretion monitored while they were receiving sunitinib, and the levels

3168

were lower compared with baseline. In particular, low or
even undetectable urinary 24-hour calcium excretion was
observed in patients who developed increased plasma
PTH levels (mean urinary calcium, 20.3 mg/24 hours
while receiving sunitinib among hyperparathyroid
patients) with an average decrease from baseline of
94.14% (P < .001) (Fig. 2). Twenty-four-hour urinary
phosphate excretion remained within the laboratory reference range without a significant change from baseline
(mean urinary phosphate, 779 mg/24 hours at baseline;
624 mg/24 hours on sunitinib; P > .05). The results of
biochemical evaluations are summarized in Table 3 and in
Figures 2 and 3.
A correlation analysis was performed in patients
with hyperparathyroidism in which PTH was compared
with serum and urinary phosphate and calcium and vitamin D. Although the patient numbers were small
patients, the development of hyperparathyroidism was
associated with low or undetectable urinary calcium
(Pearson correlation index, 0.6).
To asses the relation between these laboratory
abnormalities and bone homeostasis, collagen degradation products, bone alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin
were measured in a subgroup of 6 patients who presented
with hyperparathyroidism during sunitinib administration. Three of these patients presented with reduced levels
of osteocalcin, and the others presented values within the
laboratory range. With regard to bone resorption biomarkers, bone alkaline phosphatase levels were within the
laboratory range during sunitinib administration, whereas
collagen n-telopeptide levels were increased only in 1
patient.

Measurements were performed during the last week of treatment (ON period). Creatinine, PTH, serum calcium, and phosphate levels were measured at each
cycle. Urinary calcium and phosphate were levels measured in all patients every 3 months or as soon as plasma PTH levels increased over the upper laboratory range. Mean values of urinary calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D are related only to patients who had hyperparathyroidism.

Figure 3. Mean plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (in pg/mL) and 24-hour urinary excretion (in mg/24 hours) are illustrated from baseline and through 6 cycles of sunitinib treatment. Only hyperparathyroid patients are represented. The development of hyperparathyroidism is accompanied by a marked reduction in urinary calcium excretion.

DISCUSSION
PTH is the most important regulator of body calcium and
phosphorus levels within bone and blood through a regulatory effect on 3 mechanisms: resorption of phosphate
and calcium by the kidneys, absorption by the gut, and
dissolution from bone. This hormone acts on boneresorbing osteoclasts in the bone to increase the dissolution of calcium and phosphate, increase the renal resorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate, and stimulate
the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which
stimulates phosphate and calcium resorption by the gut
and kidneys. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by increased plasma levels of PTH and may be the

result of an autonomous hyperproduction of PTH by
parathyroid glands, usually resulting in a hypercalcemic
state; or, conversely, it may be a physiologic consequence
of hypocalcemia from attempting to correct serum calcium levels.6
In the current study, we demonstrate that nearly
70% of patients on sunitinib develop hyperparathyroidism with a series of changes in bone-related mineral metabolism. Because serum calcium levels were stable over
time, it is possible that there is a secondary pathogenesis
of this hyperparathyroid state. Furthermore, increased
PTH levels were strictly associated with a marked reduction in 24-hour calcium urinary excretion, as

3169

Original Article

demonstrated by urinary calcium measurements and elevation in some patients of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels, possibly resulting in increased calcium absorption by
the gut and kidneys. Perhaps, in patients on sunitinib, as
observed among those with end-stage chronic kidney disease, a progressive slight reduction in the serum calcium
level could generate a hyperparathyroid state followed by
an increase in urinary calcium retention and gut absorption that, finally, would result in a normalization of serum
calcium. It is noteworthy that these biochemical changes
persisted, but did not progress, during long-term therapy.
Moreover, once treatment was interrupted definitively,
PTH plasma levels returned to within the laboratory
range in a few months, confirming the hypothesis that
these alterations in mineral homeostasis are a consequence
of sunitinib administration.
Similar events have been described among patients
who received imatinib.7-13 Since 2006, different groups
have reported on the incidence of altered phosphate levels
and hyperparathyroidism in at least 50% of patients who
receive imatinib therapy.7-10 Different mechanisms have
been proposed as the cause of these abnormalities. Among
them, reduced efflux of calcium and phosphate from bone
to extracellular space because of decreased bone resorption
not corrected by a reduction in osteoblast activity; or, conversely, an increase in osteoblast activity not balanced by
an increased osteoclast function; or both at the same time,
seem to be the most likely mechanisms.14 Thus, as a consequence of these early events, a decreased serum ionized
calcium level would stimulate PTH secretion, promoting
calcium and phosphate dissolution from bone and calcium resorption from kidneys, resulting in a normalization of serum calcium levels. This hypothesis is supported
by data indicating that changes in bone density parameters, as well as hyperparathyroidism and serum mineral
abnormalities, may occur in patients who are receiving
imatinib.11,12,15 Some evidence about the effects of imatinib on the proliferation and activity of cells involved in
bone homeostasis (both osteoclasts and osteoblasts) supports this theory14; however, the exact pathogenic mechanism (or mechanisms) of this alteration remain to be fully
elucidated.
Several known imatinib targets may contribute to its
antiosteoclastogenic and osteoblastic activity. PDGFR-a
and PDGFR-b represent the best candidates to explain
the mechanism whereby imatinib affects bone. In particular, imatinib administration is supposed to interfere in
vivo with osteoclast function directly by inhibiting
PDGFR-b on osteoclasts or indirectly by inhibiting

3170

PDGFR-a on osteoblasts tightly coupled with osteoclasts
through the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway.16-21
Imatinib inhibits tyrosine kinases commonly targeted by sunitinib, resulting in common side effects, with
common pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, a possible
role of sunitinib in altering bone and mineral homeostasis
could be expected.
In our experience, we observed a new-onset, secondary, normocalcemic hyperparathyroid state in a major percentage of patients on sunitinib, supporting the
hypothesis that sunitinib may affect bone-related mineral
metabolism and, more extensively, bone remodeling.
Commonly described biochemical effects of hyperparathyroidism, such as reductions in calcium excretion and
serum phosphate and an increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also were observed in some of our patients.
Therefore, we hypothesize that sunitinib may alter bone
homeostasis, possibly through the inhibition of PDGFR
on both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, as suggested with
regard to imatinib.14 This may induce a decreased efflux
of calcium and phosphate from bone matrix to extracellular space because of decreased bone resorption and formation. We suppose that, as a possible consequence of a
transient hypocalcaemia, a secondary hyperparathyroid
state would occur, promoting calcium mobilization from
bone and its resorption from kidney (as demonstrated by
low urinary calcium levels), both directly by PTH action
and indirectly by an increase of active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, finally resulting in a normalization of calcemia.
During long-term therapy, this may result in profound
bone alterations, causing unexpected consequences for
bone health by an excessive resorption of matrix and minerals or abnormal formation.
Although bone turnover biomarkers were not analyzed prospectively in all patients enrolled in this preliminary study, we report some unexpected observations in
some patients that support our hypothesis. In particular,
levels of osteocalcin, a noncollagenous bone protein used
as marker of bone formation, commonly increased in
patients who present in a hyperparathyroid state, were low
or normal; whereas bone resorption biomarkers, such as
bone alkaline phosphatase, were within the laboratory reference range. It is noteworthy that these results are not in
accordance with the presence of a hyperparathyroid state,
because increased osteocalcin and bone resorption biomarkers would have been expected but were not observed.
However, considering some alteration in bone homeostasis as the primary cause of sunitinib-induced hyperparathyroidism, especially reduced bone resorption and

Sunitinib-Induced Hyperparathyroidism/Baldazzi et al

formation or, more extensively, an â€˜â€˜adynamic boneâ€™â€™ state,
these data could be explained more easily. Despite this, we
are aware of the limitations of our results related to our
small sample size, different timing of sampling during
treatment, and absence of baseline control parameters.
It is interesting to note a recent observation that
sunitinib was able to interfere with a myeloid cell blood
profile and circulating monocytes, a known source of
bone osteoclasts, confirming a possible role for this drug
in bone homeostasis. In particular, an increase in blood
monocytes was reported among patients who were receiving sunitinib, and this was related to tumor response,22,23
Therefore, it appears that an alteration in bone metabolism is the most appropriate explanation for the altered
mineral metabolism and parathyroid function we describe
in this preliminary work.
Recently, an increased incidence of joint osteonecrosis was reported among patients who were receiving
VEGF and VEGFR inhibitors, especially when associated
with the administration of diphosphonates.24-26 This observation supports a possible interaction of drugs that target the VEGF pathway and bone homeostasis.
Like in patients who are receiving imatinib,
throughout an inhibition of PDGFR, sunitinib could
affect bone formation and resorption, a feature common
to TKIs that are active on the PDGFR itself. It might be
of interest to define whether bone alterations appear only
in patients who develop hyperparathyroidism or are common to all patients undergoing sunitinib.
It is noteworthy that, among patients who are receiving sunitinib, an association has been described between
the occurrence of toxicities as hypothyroidism and better
outcomes.27,28 Similarly, the occurrence of hypophosphatemia during imatinib therapy has been related to
improved response rates in patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia.13 In our cohort of patients, we analyzed the
progression-free survival rate of patients according to
parathyroid function state; however, possibly because of
the small sample of patients, we did not identify any significant difference in survival (9.1 months vs 10.6 months
progression free for hyperparathyroid patients; P > .05).
Moreover we did not observe a significant relation
between the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction and hyperparathyroidism, because we observed it both in hypothyroid patients and in euthyroid patients.
In summary, although sunitinib inhibits tyrosine kinases associated with specific disease, in vivo inhibition of
molecular targets in healthy tissue may occur with unexpected clinical consequences. It is reassuring that we did

Cancer

June 15, 2012

not observe an increase in calcium levels above the normal
range, even during long-term therapy with its potentially
life-threatening consequences. In our experience, the
occurrence of hyperparathyroidism is not followed by
hypercalcemia; therefore, no patient in the current cohort
required a specific treatment for hyperparathyroidism.
These data, with evident limitations based on a small sample of patients, suggest that sunitinib affects phosphorus
and calcium homeostasis. However, the exact incidence
and possible consequences of this side effect have to be
confirmed in larger analysis, possibly including bone turnover biomarkers. If this is confirmed, then routine monitoring of serum calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D levels
as well as controls on bone mass density, would be advisable to prompt an adequate treatment especially for
patients who are receiving long-time therapy.
