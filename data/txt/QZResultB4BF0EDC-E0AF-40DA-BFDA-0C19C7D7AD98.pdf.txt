ABSTRACT
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are prone to folate deficiency
(FD). Here we showed that, in cell line-specific manner, FD caused resistance to
FD-induced oxidative stress and multi-drug resistance (MDR). This resistance was due
to upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and Survivin. Using siRNA
and Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), we found that GRP78 and Survivin cooperatively
conferred MDR by decreasing FD-induced ROS generation. Our data showed that FD
increases GRP78 and Survivin, which serve as ROS inhibitors, causing MDR in HCC.
We suggest that folate supplementation may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy.

they suggested that low blood folate status could be a risk
factor for tumor progression. These studies established
that folate deprivation is a risk factor for HCC.
Nutritional deficiencies, such as folate deprivation,
and chemotherapeutic drugs can cause cell death
via generation of oxidative-nitrosative stress (ONS)
[19–22]. However, some types of cancer cells exhibit
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
that may promote cell proliferation and in many cases
can be coupled to redox adaptation (RA) to promote
cell survival and drug resistance. RA can explain
how cancer cells survive under persistent endogenous
ROS stress and become resistant to certain anti-cancer
agents. Thus far, research efforts focusing on whether
or not folate deficiency (FD)-induced ONS on the
induction of RA and its potential impacts on the MDR
acquisition of HCC cells have been relatively sparse.
Our data demonstrated that some poorly-differentiated
and invasive subclone variant, such as SK-Hep-1 cells,
could withstand FD-induced ONS via evading apoptosis
and becoming MDR through RA-mediated upregulation
of GRP78 and Survivin, which decrease oxidative stress
and promote survival.

INTRODUCTION
Folic acid (folate; vitamin B9) is an essential
micronutrient and a critical coenzymes for the
de novo synthesis of purine and thymidylate
nucleotides and methylation and demethylation of
homocysteine/methionine [1–3]. Folate receptor
overexpressed in tumor tissues and disruption
of one-carbon metabolism can cause oxidative
stress-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis [4–9].
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
leading cause of death [10], with low response to
conventional chemotherapies [11, 12]. Most HCC
patients are prone to folate deficiency [13–15]. Meenam
et al. [16] observed that folate content was lower in
tumors than the adjacent normal cells. Furthermore,
dietary methyl deficiency and Hcy-aggravated hydrogen
peroxide production have been demonstrated to be a pair
of contributing factors in promoting mutagenesis and
hepatocarcinogenesis [17, 18]. Importantly, Kuo et al.
[15] reported that approximately 60% of HCC patients
were deficient in folate and established that folate levels
decreased drastically as HCC stage progressed. Thus,

cisplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Our results
indicate that without exception, all the drug-treated
GRP78 KD cells were substantially more susceptible to
be eradicated by these drugs as compared to scramble
cells (Figure 3). These data unequivocally demonstrate
that GRP78 per se is a legitimate chemoresistant effector.

Folate deficiency (FD) can transform redox
adaptation-prone hepatoma cell lines into MDR
phenotype
A group of HCC subclone variants including
Hep G2, Hep J5, Mahlavu and SK-Hep-1 were cultivated
under either FC or FD condition for one-week, followed
by the treatment of these cells with various concentrations
of a group of ROS-producing anti-cancer drugs including
sorafenib, cisplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. As
judged by the viability data, except for Hep G2 cells
(redox adaptation-null; Supplementary Figure 1), all three
other HCC cell types cultivated under FD condition could
unilaterally transform themselves into MDR phenotype.
However, this acquired MDR attribute could apparently
be restituted either partially or even completely by folate
resupplementation (FR) (Figure 1). This finding implies
that folate micronutrient per se can confer the cells with
the capacity to reverse MDR acquisition. *p < 0.05;
**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.

Direct targeting of either forcedly expressed
or constitutively endowed GRP78 with EGCG
effectively improves the eradicating efficiency of
HCC cells
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of direct
targeting of GRP78 with its binder EGCG for the
eradicating efficiency, several types of experiments were
performed. First, we purposely grew SK-Hep-1 cells under
FD condition to allow these cells to overexpress GRP78.
Subsequently, these cells were treated with various
concentrations of EGCG and continued to cultivate for
an additional three days. Our data clearly demonstrated
that only GRP78-overexpressing SK-Hep-1 cells
(forcedly expressed subline) were particularly sensitive
to be eradicated by EGCG treatment (Figure 4A). To
confirm this applicability, we then tested the effect of
EGCG on HCC Mahlavu cells genetically endowed
with overexpressed GRP78. Again, a similar effect of
EGCG could be reproduced (Figure 4B). **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001.

FD-evoked MDR acquisition is linked to the
redox adaptation (RA)-mediated upregulation of
GRP78 and Survivin
Cultivation of SK-Hep-1 cells under FD condition
could trigger the upregulation of ER stress chaperone
protein 78 (GRP-78) expression. The underlying
mechanism associated with this observed phenomenon
was demonstrated to be mechanistically linked to the
increased cleavage of ATF-6α (90 kDa) transcription factor
to its active subunits (50 kDa) and nuclear translocation to
release GRP-78 from its conjugated complex (Figure 2B).
Along this same vein, FD condition could also capacitate
SK-Hep-1 cells to upregulate Survivin expression which
in turn can cooperatively act as the inhibitors for caspase
3 expression (Figure 2C). The functional attribute of
overexpressed GRP78 was demonstrated to serve as a
ROS sinker which alleviated the ROS production to evade
apoptotic lethality as reflected by flowcytometric data
using DCF-DA as the probe (Figure 2D).

Constitutively overexpressed GRP78
efficaciously confers MDR attribute
Two HCC subclone variants representing
GRP78-overexpressing (Mahlavu and Hep J5) sublines
and its non-expressing counterpart (SK-Hep-1) were
used to compare their sensitivities toward a group of
anti-cancer drugs including sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), and doxorubicin. Our data indicated that
GRP78-overexpressing subclones were substantially
more resistant to these drugs as compared to their
non-expressing SK-Hep-1 cells (Figure 5). This finding
implied that constitutively overexpressed GRP78 was also
a contributing factor for the MDR acquisition. **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001.

Either GRP78 or survivin silencing discloses two
types of drug resistance mechanisms

To further confirm that GRP78 is a genuine
chemoresistant effector, SK-Hep-1 cells were
grown under FD condition for one-week in order to
allow GRP78 induction. Subsequently, GRP78 thus
induced was allowed to be knockdowned (KD) by
lentivirus-mediated knockdown technique. The scramble
and two types of GRP78 KD cells were then treated
with a group of anti-cancer drugs including sorafenib,

alterations of functional attributes of the KD cells were
uncovered. First, both GRP78 and Survivin silencing

treated with all four drugs [designated as folate resupplemented group (FR)]. All the drug-treated cultured plates (FC, FD, and FR) were
allowed to grow for additional 48-h and the viability of all cultured plates was then measured by SRB method. Remarkably, we observed
that except for Hep G2 cells, all three other types of HCC cells cultivated under FD condition could transform themself into multi-drug
resistant (MDR) phenotype. Even more interestingly, cells from FR group could apparently restitute themselves back to drug-sensitive
attribute implying that folate micronutrient per se was capable of reversing MDR attribute. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.

vulnerable to be eradicated by these drugs as compared
to scramble cells (Figure 7). This finding further
demonstrates that both GRP78 and Survivin are a pair
of genuine chemoresistant effectors.

Exogenous agents that increase ROS generation or
decrease antioxidant capacity shift the redox balance
in favor of an overall increase in the levels of ROS,
which can ultimately induce cell death [25, 26]. This
scenario was observed in hepatoma Hep G2 cells,
a well-differentiated and least oxidatively stressed
subclone variant, which underwent apoptosis when
exposed to folate deprivation (FD)-induced ONS, as
reported previously by our group [18, 27, 28]. A similar
scenario has been reported [21, 22]. However, in
sharp contrast to Hep G2 cells, three HCC cell lines
including SK-Hep-1, Mahlavu and Hep J5 were found
to be capable of evading FD-induced apoptosis and

apoptotic lethality. In order to delineate the possible role of GRP78 and Survivin in MDR acquisition, we generated GRP78 knockdown
(si-GRP78) and Survivin knockdown (si-Survivin) cells using small interfering RNA technique A. First, we observed that Mahlavu cells
with constitutively overexpressed GRP78 and Survivin were highly tolerable to FD-induced oxidative-nitrosative stress (ONS). However,
both si-GRP78 and si-Survivin cells were shown to be extremely sensitive to FD-induced ONS-mediated cell death B and C. Further
flowcytometric studies revealed that either GRP78 or Survivin alone could serve as ROS sinker via alleviating ROS generation and
maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) during an episode of FD condition D. Consequently, with the
protection of either GRP78 or Survivin, Mahlavu cells could capacitate themselves to evade from FD-induced apoptotic lethality E.

becoming MDR against a group of ROS-producing
anti-cancer agents including doxorubicin, paclitaxel,
cisplatin and sorafenib (Figure 1). Interestingly,
this transient drug resistance can be overcome by
supplementation of folate to the culture medium. This
finding has important clinical application.
Next, we investigated mechanism(s) of survival
under FD-induced ONS. Recent work showed that
ROS can cause redox adaptation, survival under ROS
stress and resistance to certain anti-cancer agents [26].
As shown by Landriscina et al. [25], one of mechanism
is heat-shock protein (HSP) expression. Elevated HSP
expression prevents spontaneous apoptosis and apoptosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

caused by therapeutic agents. We hypothesized that
FD-induced ONS activates HSP pathways that confers
MDR. Indeed, we found that SK-Hep-1 cells, but not
Hep G2 cells, unilaterally activate chaperone protein
78 (GRP78). GRP78 plays role in the ER-Ca2+ balance
via transmembrane ER stress sensor and controls
protein folding [29–31]. As a biomarker of unfolded
protein response (UPR), GRP78 overexpression has
been associated with chemoresistance in a variety of
cancers including head and neck squamous carcinoma,
glioma, melanoma, breast and hepatoma [32–36].
Resupplementation of folate can effectively downregulate
GRP78 expression in SK-Hep-1 cells, indicating that
26112

folate can be used to overcome drug resistance by FD. This
finding underscores the clinical significance of monitoring
the folate status prior to the therapeutic intervention.
Our data demonstrated that FD-induced ONS probably
upregulates an ER stress-associated GRP78 pathway via
an enhanced cleavage of ATF6α (90 kDa) transcription
factor to its active ATF6α (50 kDa) subunit and nuclear
translocation to release GRP78 from its conjugated
complex (Figure 2). FD was also induced overexpression
of Survivin, which could enable SK-Hep-1 cells to evade
apoptosis by inhibiting caspase 3 activation (Figure 2C).
Both GRP78 and Survivin could then cooperatively
alleviate ROS production [24] (Figures 2D and 6B).
Our work can help to improve tumor response and
patient survival. We hypothesized that agents capable of
abrogating such adaptation mechanisms in combination
with conventional chemotherapy should improve
therapeutic outcomes. We first utilize (-)-Epigallocatechin
gallate (EGCG), one of the major constituents of green
tea [37–41]. GRP78 overexpressed SK-Hep-1 cells
after cultivating under FD condition for 2-week could be
re-sensitized by EGCG to be eradicated more efficaciously
than control cells without GRP78 expression. To further
confirm this notion, we utilized Mahlavu cell, which
is genetically endowed with overexpressed GRP78.
When both Mahlavu and SK-Hep-1, cultivated under
folate sufficient (FC) condition, only GRP78-expressing
Mahlavu cells were more susceptible to be eradicated
by EGCG targeting strategy. Besides GRP78-targeting
strategy, we also performed the knockdown study via
small RNA interfering technique on forced GRP78
overexpression induced by growing SK-Hep-1 cells under
FD condition. As indicated in Figure 3, GRP78 KD cells
(si-GRP78–1352 and si-GRP78–1932) were extremely
vulnerable to be eradicated by all four anti-cancer
drugs tested when compared to the scramble cells. Both
GRP78 targeting strategy and Grp78 knockdown studies
demonstrate that Grp78 is a contributing factor for MDR.
To test the universality of this finding, we thus set
out to evaluate the relative sensitivity of two types of
GRP78-overexpressing subclones (Mahlavu and Hep
J5) and SK-Hep-1 (Grp78-nonexpressing subclone) cells
toward a group of ROS-producing anti-cancer drugs
including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and sorafenib.
Our data showed that indeed GRP78 plays a pivotal
role in MDR acquisition because SK-Hep-1 cells were
relatively more vulnerable to be eradicated by these
ROS-producing anti-cancer drugs owing to the deficiency
of GRP78 expression (Figure 5). In summary, GRP78,
either constitutively endowed or forcedly expressed,
could indeed contribute to the survival by defending
exogenously ROS insults.
To further obtain evidence to substantiate the
mechanistic link between GRP78, Survivin and MDR,
we performed GRP78 and Survivin silencing experiment
using siRNA technique. There are two important findings.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

First, either GRP78 or Survivin silencing result in
downregulation of heavy subunit of γ-glutamylcysteine
synthetase (γ-GCSh), a critical catalytic enzyme
responsible for the biosynthesis of GSH. Second, either
GRP78 or Survivin silencing could drastically promote
the production of ROS under FD condition as reflected
by an approximately 3- to 6-fold increases in DCF
fluorescence intensity observed flowcytometrically
(Figure 6B). This  finding implicates that both GRP78
and/or Survivin may play pivotal role as a ROS sinker.
Consequently, elevated ROS production in cells without
GRP78 or Survivin expression will ultimately provoke
the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential
(∆Ψm) leading to apoptotic lethality (Figure 6E). Along
the same vein, either GRP78 or Survivin silencing could
sensitize Mahlavu cells to be effectively eradicated by
a group of ROS-producing anti-cancer drugs including
sorafenib, 5-FU, paclitaxel and doxorubicin (Figure 7).
Several conclusions can be drawn from the current
studies. First, our study adds to the literature on the
direct and concrete evidence linking the relationship
between FD-induced ONS and enhanced MDR
acquisition. Second, our findings link FD-induced ROS
to redox adaptation-mediated upregulation of GRP78
and Survivin. Third, disruption of GRP78 expression
with EGCG and siRNA knockdown sensitized
GRP78-expressing HCC cells to be eradicated. Fourth,
our results suggest that prior to chemotherapeutic
treatment, monitoring of nutritional status of folate
probably should be necessary. In another words,
treatment with folate to prevent its deficiency may be
of critically importance to achieve satisfactory result of
chemotherapy. Finally, the overall interactions of various
pathways activated by FD-mediated ONS, which confer
MDR, can be summarized diagrammatically in Figure 8.

(1: 1000), ATF4 (1: 250), ATF6α (1: 250), Survivin
(1: 1000), pro-caspase 3 (1: 1000), PARP-1 (1: 1000),
β-catenin (1: 1000) and SP-1 (1: 500). After washing in
TBST buffer, the membrane was further incubated with
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Chemicon, Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) for 1-h. Detection was performed
by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) after incubation with a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. β-actin
was used as the loading control.

The GRP78 and Survivin knockdown of
Mahlavu cells were carried out according to the
procedures of Chang et al. [23, 24]. Briefly, the
target sequence for the human GRP78 mRNA was
5′-AAGGTTACCCATGCAGTTGTT-3′
and
the
human Survivin mRNA was 5′-TGGGAGCCA
GATGACGACC-3′. The scrambled siRNA sequence was
5′-AAGGTGGTTGTTTTGTTCACT-3′. The GRP78
siRNA, Survivin siRNA and scrambled siRNA were
inserted into the pSUPERIOR vector and transfected into
the cells. We applied 1 pulse for 20 milliseconds under
a fixed voltage of 1.4 kV on a pipette-type microporator
Neon (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Cells that were
successfully transfected were selected by antibiotic
resistance.

Flowcytometric measurement of intracellular
ROS and mitochondrial membrane
potential (∆Ψm)
All fluorescence probes were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified.
Intracellular ROS production was measured using
DCFH-DA probe. Briefly after cells were cultivated under
FD condition, the culture medium was then replaced with
new FD medium and followed by the incubation with
10 μM DCFH-DA for 30 min in the dark. Cells were then
washed once with PBS, detached by trypsinization and
collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in PBS.
To measure cellular mitochondrial membrane
potential (∆Ψm), FC or FD cells were incubated with
5 μM rhodamine 123 for 30 min in the dark. Cells were
then washed twice with PBS, detached by trypsinization
and collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in
PBS. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in a 6-well plastic plate and
exposed to 1, 5 μM doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), 20, 40 μg/ml cisplatin (Platinol®), 1, 5 μg/ml
paclitaxel (Taxol®), 20, 40 μM sorafenib (Nexavar®) in
duplicate for 48-h in at least two independent experiments
(n = 4). Cell viability was assayed by the sulforhodamine
B (SRB) method. Growth inhibition was calculated as
the percentage of surviving cells in drug-treated versus
untreated cells (which were incubated with FD for 1 or 2
weeks). In SRB method, cultures fixed with trichloroacetic
acid and were stained for 30 minutes with 0.4% (w/v) SRB
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in 1%

Apoptotic cell death was assayed by using
an Apo-BrdU in situ DNA fragmentation assay kit
(Promega, Medison, WI, USA). This kit measures the
fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells by catalytically
incorporating fluorescein-12-dUTP at 3′-OH DNA ends
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme.
The fluorescein-12-dUTP-labeled DNA can then be
quantitiated by flowcytometry. In this study, Mahlavu cells
were cultivated in either FC or FD condition for six days
and the fluoressein-12-dUTP-labeled fragmented DNA of
apoptotic cells were quantified using Becton-Dickinson
FACS-Calibur flow- cytometer.
