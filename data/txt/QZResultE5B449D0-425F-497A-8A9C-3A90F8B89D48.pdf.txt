Abstract
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) have a strong propensity for
aggressive growth and metastasis. We showed that the
secreted Wnt antagonist Frzb exhibited potent antitumor
activity against prostate cancer, an epithelial type of malignancy. In this study, we further showed the antitumor efficacy
of Frzb in STS, a mesenchymal group of cancer. Frzb
transfection of HT1080 ( fibrosarcoma) and SW872 (liposarcoma) cell lines and their conditioned media resulted in
a significant reduction in cellular invasion, motility, and
colony formation in soft agar compared with vector control–
transfected cells. In a xenograft mouse model, Frzb dramatically suppressed tumor growth of HT1080 cells in nude mice.
In a tail-vein injection metastatic model, Frzb-transfected
HT1080 cells formed fewer and smaller lung nodules than
vector control cells. In addition, we identified new mechanisms for Frzb antitumor activities. Frzb reduced c-Met
expression and inhibited Met-mediated signaling, associated
with up-regulation of epithelial markers (i.e., keratins 8
and 18) and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers (i.e.,
vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, Slug, and Twist). Similar
to Frzb, silencing of c-Met by short hairpin RNA or using a
dominant-negative LRP5 receptor also suppressed Met signaling, leading to reduced cellular motility, invasion, and in vivo
tumor growth. Given recent studies indicating an important
role of c-Met in sarcoma development and progression, our
data showed that Frzb expression was significantly inversely
correlated with Met expression in both STS cell lines and
tissues. These results suggested the usefulness of Frzb in
modulating Met signaling as a new treatment strategy for STS.

Introduction
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin, among which liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma are the most common histologic subtypes in adults (1).
The mortality rates of STS approach 50% (1). Despite advances in
cancer therapy, the mainstay of treatment for STS is still surgical
resection. Complete response to conventional chemotherapy is
rare, and the prognosis for patients with unresectable or metastatic

disease remains dismal. Radiation therapy improves local control
for high-grade tumors. However, local control does not always
translate into better overall survival as systemic disease continues
to be a major prognosticator (1). Currently, there is no convincing
evidence that conventional chemotherapy significantly alters the
natural history of STS. Therefore, more effective strategies are
needed to improve systemic and local control.
In the canonical Wnt pathway, Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled
receptors (Fz) and coreceptors low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated proteins (LRP5/LRP6), leading to activation of disheveled
(Dsh), inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h), and
disaggregation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Axin, and
GSK3h. As a consequence, degradation of h-catenin is blocked,
leading to cytoplasmic accumulation and nuclear translocation of
this protein. Inside the nucleus, h-catenin binds to lymphoid
enhancer factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF), inducing the transcription of Wnt target genes (2).
Wnt signaling has been implicated in several human tumors,
among which are skin, connective tissue, colon, gastric, lung,
breast, and prostate (3–9). In addition, recent studies highlighted
the potential role for Wnt signaling in STS. Sporadic mutations of
Wnt components, such as h-catenin and APC, have been reported
in STS (10, 11). Recently, Wnt5A and Fz10 have been shown to be
highly expressed in synovial sarcomas (12). Wnt-1 blockade by a
monoclonal antibody or small interfering RNA (siRNA) can induce
cell death in rhabdomyosarcoma (13). These findings strongly
suggest that Wnt activation at the membrane level plays an
important role in STS pathobiology.
Frzb (also known as sFRP3) belongs to the secreted Fz-related
protein family, whose members share a characteristic cysteinerich domain (CRD) with Fz receptors (14). Frzb blocks receptor
signaling by binding to extracellular Wnt ligands and thus preventing ligand-receptor interaction (15, 16). The Gly324 variant of
Frzb with attenuated ability to antagonize Wnt has been associated
with an increased risk of colon cancer (17). Recently, Mandal
et al. (18) reported that Frzb expression was down-regulated in
osteosarcoma tissue and cell lines. Together, these findings strongly
suggest a tumor suppressor role for Frzb. To examine the role of
Frzb in STS, we established stable fibrosarcoma and liposarcoma
cell lines expressing this protein. Blocking Wnt signaling by Frzb
led to a marked reduction in cell motility, invasiveness, and tumorigenesis. These effects were associated with decreased expression
and activity of c-Met and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).
In liposarcoma cell line SW872, decreased invasiveness was also
associated with increased expression of epithelial markers (i.e.,
keratins 8 and 18) and decreased expression of mesenchymal
markers (i.e., vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, Slug, and Twist).
Our results implicated an important tumor suppressive function
for Frzb in sarcomas.

Frzb Modulates Met in Fibrosarcoma

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and plasmid. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF)
and skeletal muscle stromal cells (SMSC) were obtained from the Clonetics
collection (Cambrex Corp.) and maintained in the following Cambrex
media: FGM-2 medium (NHDF cells) and ScGM medium (SMSC cells).
HT1080 cell line ( fibrosarcoma), SW872 cell line (liposarcoma), and
SK-LMS-1 cell line (leiomyosarcoma) were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. SYO-1 cell line (synovial sarcoma) was a gift from Marc
Ladanyi (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). HT1080 cells were
maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen).
SK-LMS-1 and SYO-1 cells were maintained in MEMa with 10% FBS. SW872
cells were grown in Liebovitz’s L-15 medium with 10% FBS. All cell lines
were maintained at 37jC in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, except for
SW872 cells, which was cultured without CO2. PcDNA3.1 expression vector
was obtained from Invitrogen. The PcDNA3.1 vector expressing bovine Frzb
was described previously (3). The dominant-negative LRP5 plasmid
(DNLRP5, a generous gift from Dr. Matthew Warman, Children’s Hospital
Boston) encodes a secreted form of LRP5 (DTM; ref. 19). The TCF4
luciferase reporter (Super TOPFLASH and Super FOPFLASH) and full-length
h-catenin plasmids were from Dr. Marian Waterman (University of
California). h-Galactosidase plasmid was obtained from Invitrogen.
Stable transfection. HT1080 cells and SW872 cells were plated at
2  105 per well in six-well plates. After 24 h, 60% confluent cultures were
transfected with Frzb or DNLRP5 construct using Fugene 6 (Roche) as
reported (20). As controls, HT1080 and SW872 cells were also transfected
with PcDNA3.1. Transfected cells were then selected with G418 (800 Ag/mL)
starting at 24 h after transfection, and all stable transfectants were pooled
to avoid cloning artifacts.
RNA interference. The SureSilencing Met short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
plasmids were obtained from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation. Each
vector contains a U1 promoter and neomycin resistance gene for stable
selection. A human c-Met shRNA (5¶-gcgaagtcctcttaacatctaCTTCCTGTCAtagatgttaagaggacttcgc-3¶) was used to achieve stable knockdown. A
scrambled artificial sequence(5¶-ggaatctcattcgatgcatacCTTCCTGTCAgtatgcatcgaatgagattcc-3¶), which does not match any human or mouse gene, was
used as a negative control. All constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with G418. The pooled stable
transfectants were examined.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was
isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was performed
as previously described (3). PCR condition was as follows: 95jC for 5 min,
40 cycles of 30 s at 95jC, 30 s at 68jC, 60 s at 72jC. Relative fold change
compared with control was calculated using the comparative C t method
(21). C t is the cycle number at which fluorescence intensity first exceeds the
C t (actin). Gene specific primer
threshold level. DC t is C t (target gene)
sequences are available upon request. Specificity of amplification products
were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis.
Western blot analysis. Twenty to 80 Ag of protein lysate were separated
electrophoretically on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against E-cadherin
and N-cadherin (BD Bioscience); vimentin, keratin 8, keratin 18, and fibronectin (Lab Vision); AKT, phosphorylated AKT, mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), phosphorylated MAPK, phosphorylated Met, and Frzb
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); and Slug, Twist, Met, and h-actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Blots were exposed to secondary antibodies and visualized
using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).
For loading control, membranes were stripped and reprobed with h-actin.
Immunofluorescence. Transfected cells were grown overnight in LabTek II Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International) and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min and methanol for 2 min. After
blocking with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, cells were
incubated with primary antibodies (dilution, 1:50 to 1:100) for 1 h. After
washing in PBS, cells were incubated for 45 min with an Alexa-488–
conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) and mounted in
Vectashield. Immunostaining was analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S

fluorescent microscope (magnification, 200) using the 488-excitation
wavelength.
Gelatin zymography. Conditioned medium was collected by culturing
cells in serum-free medium at 90% confluence for 48 h. The medium was
concentrated 20 using Centricon filters (Millipore). Samples were applied
to non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatin.
After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated
overnight at 37jC in zymography buffer, and stained with Coomassie
brilliant blue (3). Gelatinolytic activity was visualized as clear areas of lysis
in the gel.
Luciferase and B-galactosidase assays. STS cells stably expressing
PcDNA3.1, Frzb, or DNLRP5 were grown in six-well plates and transiently
cotransfected with 1 Ag Super TOPFLASH or Super FOPFLASH and
0.1 Ag cytomegalovirus (CMV)–h-galactosidase plasmids (Invitrogen) using
FuGENE 6. After 24 h, cells were harvested, and the luciferase and
h-galactosidase activities were measured using Bright-Glo luciferase assay
system and h-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). The relative
luciferase unit for each transfection was adjusted by h-galactosidase activity
in the same sample.
Motility and Matrigel invasion assays. These assays were performed as
previously described (20). For motility, cells were allowed to migrate
through uncoated filters for 8 to 12 h at 37jC. The number of migrating
cells was determined by counting 10 fields (100) on each membrane and
calculated as mean number of cells per field. For invasion, incubation was
carried out for 16 h (HT1080 cells) and 28 h (SW872 cells) at 37jC in
humidified air with 5% CO2. The number of invading cells was determined
by counting 10 fields at 100 magnification. All cell lines were assayed in
triplicate for each experiment, and the mean F SE was determined.
Transient transfection. For Met rescue experiments, a cDNA clone
containing a full-length human Met ORF was purchased from Invitrogen
(Ultimate ORF Clone, Invitrogen) and subcloned into a PcDNA40
destination vector (Invitrogen). The resulting Met expression construct
was transiently cotransfected into Frzb-transfected HT1080 and SW872 cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). PcDNA40 empty vector was
cotransfected into PcDNA-transfected cells as a control. At 24 h after
transfection, cells were harvested and used for motility and Matrigel
invasion assays.
To examine h-catenin–mediated effects, HT1080 and SW872 cells stably
transfected with Met shRNA or control shRNA were transiently cotransfected with h-catenin expression construct (a gift from Dr. Marian
Waterman, University of California-Irvine) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). PcDNA empty vector was cotransfected as a control. At
24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and used for motility and
Matrigel invasion assays.
Colony formation assay. This assay was done in six-well plates with
each well containing 2 mL of 0.8% agar in complete medium as the bottom
layer, 1 mL of 0.38% agar in complete medium with 4,000 cells as the feeder
layer, and 1 mL of complete medium as the top layer. The number of
colonies was determined using an inverted microscope at 100 magnification. A group of >10 cells was considered a colony. The data represent
means F SE of four independent wells at 18 d after seeding.
In vivo tumor growth and metastasis assays. NCR-nu/nu (nude)
mice were obtained from Taconic. Stably transfected HT1080 cells
(1  106/200 AL PBS) were injected s.c. into the right flank. Tumor size
was measured every 3 d with a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated by
the formula 1/6pab 2 (p = 3.14, a = long axis, and b = short axis of the
tumor). Growth curves were plotted from the mean tumor volume F SE
from 10 animals in each group.
For lung metastasis, stably transfected HT1080 cells (1  106/200 AL PBS)
were injected i.v. via the tail vein. Animals were sacrificed on day 40 after
injection. Lungs were harvested and fixed in Bouin’s solution. Surface lung
nodules were counted under a dissecting microscope. Microscopic lung
metastases were visualized on 5-Am paraffin-embedded sections. All animal
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the University of California-Irvine.
Immunohistochemistry. Flank tumors and lung tissues were fixed in
formalin and sectioned. Antigen retrieval was done using 10 mmol/L

sodium citrate (pH 6.0) at 95jC for 15 min. Slides were incubated with an
anti-Flag M2 antibody (Stratagene) at 1:50 dilution for 12 h at room
temperature. Slides were then incubated with a biotinylated secondary
antibody. Staining was performed using a Cell and Tissue Staining kit (R&D
Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and photographed using a light microscope.
Negative control samples were exposed to a secondary antibody with a
similar IgG isotype (Cell Signaling) to the primary antibody.
Paired human STS tissue array slides were purchased from Cybrdi, each
containing paraffin-embedded STS samples that were pathologically
confirmed: leiomyosarcoma (n = 11), fibrosarcoma (n = 7), liposarcoma
(n = 13), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1). No paired normal tissues were
available for these samples. The histologic diagnoses were confirmed by a
musculoskeletal pathologist, and immunohistochemical staining of tissue
array slides were done using human Met (C-28, 1:250 dilution) or Frzb
(C-20, 1:100 dilution) primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
biotinylated secondary antibodies. Stained sections were scored by two
independent investigators (one of whom is a musculoskeletal pathologist)
and classified as 0 (negative), 1+ (low), 2+ (moderate), or 3+ (high) according to the staining intensity. Xenograft tumor tissues were stained with
IgG and Frzb or Met antibodies for negative and positive controls,
respectively.
Statistical analysis. Comparisons of number of invading cells, agar
colonies, levels of mRNA expression, levels of protein expression, and
luciferase activity between different transfection groups were done using
Student’s t test. To correlate Met and Frzb protein expression on Western
blots, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated from densitometry
measurements of protein bands. For tumor growth, repeated measures
ANOVA were used to examine the differences in tumor size among different
time points. Additional posttest was performed to examine the difference in
tumor size between vector control and other transfection at each time point
by using conservative Bonferroni method. All statistical tests were twosided. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Because tissue
immunostaining intensity is an ordinal categorical variable, Spearman’s
rank-order correlation coefficients were calculated and the test of the
correlation coefficient equals 0 was performed using Student’s t test.

Results
Frzb expression is down-regulated and inversely related to
Met expression in STS cell lines and tissues, and Frzb
transfection decreases anchorage-independent growth of
HT1080 cells associated with Wnt inhibition. Endogenous levels
of Frzb mRNA were examined in two normal human primary cell
lines (NHDF and SMSC) and four STS cell lines ( fibrosarcoma,
HT1080; liposarcoma, SW872; leiomyosarcoma, SK-LMS-1; synovial
sarcoma, SYO-1) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Frzb mRNA
levels in all STS cell lines were down-regulated when compared
with NHDF control (Fig. 1A, left; P < 0.04). In contrast, mRNA levels
of LRP5 (a coreceptor required for canonical Wnt signaling) were
significantly up-regulated in HT1080, SW872, and SYO-1 cell lines
compared with NHDF control (Fig. 1A, right; P < 0.01). Due to low
endogenous levels of Frzb and high LRP5 expression, HT1080 and
SW872 cell lines were selected for further analysis of Wnt signaling
blockade by secreted Wnt antagonists Frzb and DNLRP5. By
Western blotting, we found a very significant inverse relationship
between Frzb and Met protein expression in three STS (HT1080,
SW872, Sk-LMS-1) and two normal control cell lines (NHDF, SMSC;
Fig. 1B, top and bottom). Correlation of densitometric measurement of Frzb and Met protein bands (Pearson correlation
coefficient, 0.68; P < 0.01) suggested that Frzb may negatively
influence Met expression at least in a subset of STS cells. In
addition, immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays (Fig. 1C;
Supplementary Table S1) comprising of leiomyosarcoma, lipo-

sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 32) revealed a
significant inverse correlation between Frzb and Met levels of
expression (Spearman rank order correlation coefficient, 0.47;
Student’s t test, P < 0.05).
By Western blot analysis, we confirmed expression of Frzb and
DNLRP5 fusion proteins using anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies,
respectively (Fig. 1D). To evaluate the levels of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity, HT1080 and SW872 cells expressing PCDNA3.1,
Frzb, or DN-LRP5 were transiently cotransfected with reporter plasmids containing either wild-type (Super TOPFLASH) or mutant
(Super FOPFLASH) consensus TCF/LEF binding elements and
CMV-galactosidase plasmids. Compared with controls, Frzb reduced
LEF/TCF transcriptional activity by 68% (HT1080) and 73% (SW872;
Student’s t test; P < 0.05; Fig. 1D). Similarly, DNLRP5 decreased
transcriptional activity in HT1080 and SW872 cells by 83% and 82%
of controls, respectively (Student’s t test; P < 0.05; Fig. 1D).
In soft agar, Frzb-transfected HT1080 cells formed 83.1% less
colonies than vector control cells (Student’s t test; P = 0.01;
Supplementary Fig. S1), whereas DNLRP5 transfection abrogated
colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggest
that Frzb and DNLRP5 can reduce anchorage-independent tumor
growth, parallel with their ability to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling
(Fig. 1D). We were unable to study anchorage-independent growth
of SW872 cell line given this line did not form any colony in
soft agar.
Frzb inhibits in vivo tumor growth of fibrosarcoma. We next
performed xenograft experiments to determine the ability of secreted Wnt antagonists Frzb and DNLRP5 in inhibition of in vivo
tumor growth in nude mice. Figure 2A shows that tumor volume in
Frzb-transfected HT1080 cell line is significantly lower than that of
vector control cell line (Student’s t test, P = 0.03; Fig. 2A). In
addition, tumors from Frzb-transfected cell line did not enlarge
15 days after mice bearing tumors from vector-transfected cells
were sacrificed (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis
using an anti-FLAG antibody confirmed Frzb-transfected tumors
expressed the FLAG-tagged Frzb protein compared with vector
control–transfected tumors (Fig. 2B). Consistent with its Wnt
inhibitory activity (Fig. 1D), DNLRP5 transfection resulted in a
complete suppression of tumor growth in nude mice (Fig. 2C).
No tissue is available in the DNLRP5 transfection group for immunohistochemical analysis. Parental and control-transfected SW872
cells did not show in vivo tumorigenic or metastatic potential in
nude mice (data not shown). Therefore, we cannot measure
reduced tumorigenicity or metastatic potential by Frzb using this
particular cell line.
Frzb suppresses in vitro motility and invasiveness. To
examine whether Wnt antagonists Frzb and DNLRP5 also affect
the invasiveness of STS cell lines, we have performed transwell
motility and Matrigel invasion assays. Figure 3A showed that
at 8 hours (HT1080) and 12 hours (SW872) after seeding, Frzbtransfected and DNLRP5-transfected cell lines exhibited significantly lower motility compared with vector control–transfected
cells (P = 0.03, Student’s t test). The in vitro Matrigel transwell assay
showed that Frzb decreased the number of invading cells by 80%
(HT1080) and 60% (SW872) compared with vector control cells
(Student’s t test, P < 0.01; Fig. 3A). Similarly, DNLRP5 reduced
invasive capacity of HT1080 and SW872 cells by 48.5% and 45.5%,
respectively (Student’s t test, P < 0.03; Fig. 3A). To examine the
physiologic effect of Frzb protein, we collected conditioned media
from stable SW872/Frzb and SW872/PcDNA cell lines and treated
HT1080 and SW872 parental cells. Figure 3 showed that Frzb

conditioned media (50% final concentration) decreased the
Matrigel invasive capacity of HT1080 and SW872 cells by 57%
and 61%, respectively, compared with control conditioned media
(Student’s t test, P < 0.01).

Frzb modulates Met signaling, expression of epithelial-tomesenchymal transition–related markers, and MMP-2 activity
in STS cells. Based on the information that Wnt signaling affects
multiple target genes (2, 3), we predicted that Frzb may affect

HT1080/Frzb, HT1080/DNLRP5, SW872/PcDNA, SW872/Frzb, and SW872/DNLRP5) were cotransfected with Super TOPFLASH and Super FOPFLASH luciferase
reporters with h-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The relative TCF/LEF transcriptional activity in Frzb and DNLRP5
transfectants was compared with vector control transfectants after normalizing transfection efficiency by the activity of h-galactosidase. Columns , means of relative

several pathways responsible for tumor invasion, metastasis, and
growth. First, given that c-Met, a potential Wnt target gene, plays
an important role in sarcoma progression (22, 23), we examined
whether Frzb modulates Met signaling in HT1080 and SW872 cell
lines. Frzb and DNLRP5 transfection decreased protein expression
and phosphorylation of c-Met (Fig. 4A). Consistently, Frzb and
DNLRP5 also inhibited Met-mediated downstream events AKT
and MAPK phosphorylation in both cell lines (Fig. 4A). Frzb

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

conditioned media (50% final concentration) decreased Met
protein expression in both HT1080 and SW872 cell lines compared
with conditioned media from PcDNA control culture (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Met downstream event AKT phosphorylation was
decreased in SW872 cell line. In HT1080 cells, however, phosphorylated AKT band was not detected in either control or Frzb-treated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A), perhaps partially due to a low
concentration of HGF in the mixture containing growth medium
and serum-free conditioned media, low autocrine HGF secretion,
and no constitutive Met receptor activation in HT1080 cell line.
To examine whether Wnt stimulation can positively modulate
Met signaling, we treated parental SW872 cells with 50%
conditioned media from Wnt3a secreting L cells. Both Met protein
expression and downstream event phosphorylated AKT were
up-regulated in response to exogenous Wnt3a (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). To examine the effects of other Wnt antagonist, such as
Dkk-1 on Met signaling, we transiently transfected SW872 cells with
a human Dkk-1 expression construct. Our preliminary results
showed that Dkk-1 overexpression decreased Met protein expression and phosphorylation similar to the effects of Frzb.4
Second, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has
been shown to be important for cancer progression and metastasis.
We have shown that Frzb caused a reversal of the EMT in prostate
cancer PC-3 cells (3). Therefore, we examined whether Frzb can
modulate EMT-related markers associated with tumor invasion in
STS cells. Figure 4B showed that Frzb-transfected SW872 cells
exhibited up-regulation of epithelial markers keratin 8 and keratin
18 by Western analysis and E-cadherin by real-time RT-PCR.
We were unable to detect E-cadherin protein using Western blot
or immunofluorescence, perhaps due to the low endogenous
protein level of E-cadherin in SW872 cells. Conversely, mesenchymal markers (i.e., N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin) were
markedly down-regulated in Frzb-transfected SW872 cells (Fig. 4B).
Transcription factors Slug and Twist, both known to repress
E-cadherin and promote a mesenchymal phenotype (24), were also
down-regulated (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescent staining showed
down-regulation of keratin 18 and up-regulated vimentin (Fig. 4B)
without noticeable changes in cellular morphology. We were
unable to detect any changes in EMT-related markers in Frzbtransfected HT1080 cell line (data not shown). Our data further
support the role of Frzb in modulating EMT-related events,
depending on specific cellular context.
Third, several MMPs are additional Wnt target genes that play
an important role in promoting sarcoma invasion (25–28). Thus,
we also examined the effects of Frzb and DNLRP5 on MMPs
expression. Frzb reduced expression of pro-MMP-2 protein in both
HT1080 and SW872 cell lines (Fig. 4C), whereas expression of
MMP-9 and MMP-14 were not affected (data not shown). Figure 4E
showed that Frzb consistently reduced MMP-2 enzyme activity by
zymography. DNLRP5 transfection showed similar effects on proMMP-2 expression and enzymatic activity (Fig. 4C). These results
suggest that down-regulation of MMP-2 is also one of the mechanisms by which secreted Wnt antagonists suppress the invasiveness of STS.
Taken together, our data suggested that inhibition of Wnt
signaling by secreted antagonists Frzb and DNLRP5 affected
multiple Wnt-related pathways in STS cell lines, leading to reduced
cellular invasiveness.

Frzb Modulates Met in Fibrosarcoma

Inhibition of c-Met by RNA interference reduces in vitro
invasion and in vivo tumor growth. We next examined whether
c-Met expression is at least in part required for in vitro and in vivo
tumor growth of STS cells. Figure 5A showed that c-Met protein
expression in HT1080 and SW872 cell lines was efficiently

inhibited up to 90% using a predesigned plasmid-based shRNA
compared with a control shRNA construct encoding a scrambled
artificial sequence. Down-regulation of c-Met protein by shRNA
led to a marked reduction in cellular motility and invasion
compared with control shRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5B; P < 0.01).

Figure 3. Frzb and DNLRP5 decrease
motility and invasiveness of STS cells.
Invasive capacity and motility were
determined by transwell invasion assays
with and without Matrigel. A, porous
membranes without Matrigel were used to
assess motility. HT1080 and SW872 cells
were allowed to migrate for 8 and 12 h,
respectively. Matrigel-coated membranes
were used to assess invasion activity.
HT1080 and SW872 cells were allowed to
invade through Matrigel for 16 and 24 h,
respectively. B, Matrigel invasion assays
were performed with control and Frzb
conditioned media. Nonmigrating cells in
the upper chamber were removed with
cotton swabs. Cells on the lower surface
of the membrane were fixed in methanol
and stained with hematoxylin. Motility and
invasion activity was determined by
counting 10 fields at 100 magnification
on each membrane and calculated as
mean number of cells per field. Columns,

Frzb Modulates Met in Fibrosarcoma

The control shRNA-transfected HT1080 and SW872 cell lines did
not show any difference in c-Met expression and cellular invasion
with their parental cell (data not shown). Consistently, c-Met
silencing by shRNA led to inhibition of its downstream events,
AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Met shRNA also
caused induction of epithelial markers (keratin 8/keratin 18) and
down-regulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and
vimentin) in SW872 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting
that c-Met act downstream of Frzb to partially modulate the
EMT.
To determine the relative contribution of c-Met to Wnt-mediated
invasive activity of STS cells, we transiently cotransfected a
h-catenin expression construct into Met shRNA-transfected
HT1080 and SW872 cells. In control-transfected HT1080 cells,
h-catenin increased cellular invasiveness by 63%, whereas in
HT1080/Met-ShRNA cells, h-catenin only increased invasiveness by
6% (Student’s t test, P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similarly,
h-catenin increased invasiveness by 221% in control SW872 cells,
whereas in SW872/Met-ShRNA cells, h-catenin only increased
invasiveness by 71% (Student’s t test, P < 0.05; Supplementary
Fig. S4A). In contrast, h-catenin–mediated cell motility was less
dependent on Met expression. h-Catenin transfection increased
motility by 62% and 66% in control and Met ShRNA-transfected
SW872 cells, respectively (Student’s t test, P = 0.77; Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Similarly, h-catenin increased motility by 21% in control
and 37% in Met shRNA-transfected HT0180 cells (Student’s t test,
P = 0.23; Supplementary Fig. S4B). Together, these data suggested
that Met expression was at least partially required for Wntmediated cellular invasiveness.
To further examine whether the effect of Met siRNA is independent of the Wnt pathway, overexpression of a full-length Met
construct was used to rescue the phenotype found in Frzb and
DNLRP5-transfected cells. In Frzb-transfected HT1080 cells, Met
overexpression significantly increased motility and invasiveness
compared with control-transfected cells (Student’s t test, P < 0.05;
Fig. 5C). Similarly, overexpression of Met significantly increased
motility and invasiveness of DNLRP5-transfected HT1080 cells
compared with controls (Student’s t test, P < 0.01; Fig. 5C). In
SW872 cells, overexpression of Met either restored (Student’s
t test, P < 0.9; Fig. 5C) or significantly increased (Student’s t test,
P < 0.05; Fig. 5C) motility and invasiveness of Frzb-transfected
or DNLRP5-transfected cells. These results indicated that Met can
overcome the repression induced by Wnt antagonists, therefore
suggesting that Met acts as a downstream target for Wnt signaling
in STS.
In addition, we showed that HT1080 cell line with stable Met
suppression by shRNA did not form overt tumors in nude mice
(Fig. 5D), whereas HT1080 cell line stably transfected with a control
shRNA grew as rapidly as the parental cell line (data not shown).
Together, these results suggest that inhibition of Met signaling by
Frzb and DNLRP5 may at least in part be responsible for the
antiinvasion and antitumor growth activities of these two
antagonists.
Role of Frzb in the formation of lung metastasis in vivo and
tissue immunostaining. Given that Frzb decreased STS cell
motility and invasion in vitro, we examined whether Frzb can affect
metastasis formation in vivo. For these experiments, HT1080 cells
were used due to their propensity to form lung metastasis in nude
mice by tail vein injection. Figure 6A showed that Frzb-transfected
cell line formed 67.3% fewer lung nodules than control-transfected
cells (Student’s t test, P < 0.01). In addition, nodules formed by

www.aacrjournals.org

Frzb-transfected cells seem smaller by histologic examination than
nodules from control-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). Consistent with its
Wnt inhibitory activity (Fig. 1C), DNLRP5 transfection abrogated
the formation of metastatic foci in tail-vein injected animals
(data not shown). These results suggested that secreted Wnt
antagonists negatively regulated the formation of lung metastasis
by reducing the ability of STS cells to colonize lung tissue.

Discussion
Frzb/sFRP3, originally isolated as a chondrogenic factor from
articular cartilage, is a potent antagonist of the Wnt signaling
pathway (14, 29). We previously showed that Frzb had a dramatic
tumor suppressive activity in vivo on prostate cancer cell line PC-3,
a cell type of epithelial origin (3). In this study, we further showed
that Frzb markedly suppressed tumorigenicity of HT1080 cell line,
which is of mesenchymal origin. These results suggest the
generality of Frzb tumor suppressive function in cancer.
In addition to in vivo data, our in vitro studies showed that
Frzb reduced cell motility and invasion associated with inhibition
of Met signaling, up-regulation of epithelial markers (i.e., keratins
8 and 18), down-regulation of mesenchymal markers (i.e.,
vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, Slug, and Twist), and reduced
expression and activity of MMP-2. Given c-Met was reported as a
Wnt target gene (6) and silencing of c-Met by shRNA achieved
similar in vitro and in vivo effects as Frzb (Fig. 5), our data suggest
that Met may serve as a downstream event of Frzb-induced
effects in STS cell lines. Recent reports indicate that c-Met
expression is regulated by Wnt signaling, at least in certain
cellular context (6). Consistent with these reports, Frzb and
DNLRP5 transfection led to down-regulation of c-Met, with a
concomitant decrease in invasiveness of STS cell lines. ShRNAmediated silencing confirmed that c-Met was partially responsible
for the invasive activity and a reversal of EMT-related events
(i.e., up-regulation of keratin 8/keratin 18 and down-regulation
of fibronectin, N-cadherin, and Twist) in SW872 cell line. It is
intriguing that although Wnt/TCF can induce c-Met expression,
LEF/TCF binding sites in the Met promoter have not yet been
identified (6). Further studies are necessary to elucidate detailed
mechanisms of c-Met regulation by Wnt signaling.
Frequent dysregulation of Met expression has been reported in
mesenchymal tumors (22), and overexpression of c-Met can transform normal osteoblasts into osteosarcoma cells (23). Met signaling
can be activated in tumor cells through several mechanisms.
Overexpression of c-Met can lead to spontaneous dimerization of
this receptor and subsequent activation, even in the absence of
ligand (30). Another mechanism of Met activation is by liganddependent autocrine or paracrine stimulation, as seen in many
types of mesenchymal tumors (31). For instance, osteosarcoma and
rhadomyosarcoma cells often coexpress c-Met and HGF, forming
an autocrine circuit for constitutive Met signaling (22, 32, 33).
This overactivity of Met signaling then promotes tumor growth
and invasion (34). Conversely, down-regulation of c-Met by shRNA
has been shown to inhibit proliferation, invasion, and anchorageindependent growth of rhabdomyosarcoma (35). Here, we showed
that suppression of c-Met by shRNA in HT1080 cell line resulted
in a complete inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice. In addition,
c-Met knockdown also reduced motility and invasion of HT1080
and SW872 cell lines (Fig. 5B). Together, these results suggest that
c-Met is a critical target for treatment of mesenchymal tumors. In
addition, our study indicates that secreted Wnt antagonists Frzb

and DNLRP5 can serve as a means to down-regulate c-Met and its
mediated signaling in STS tumors.
The mechanism of Wnt activation have not been ascertained in
the majority of sarcomas. Haydon et al. (36) have shown that
cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of h-catenin occurred in
osteosarcoma without any activating mutation. Sievers et al. (37)
reported that APC gene promoter was hypermethylated without
mutations in myxoid liposarcoma. Protocols are in progress in our
laboratory to obtain clinical specimens to determine whether
down-regulation of secreted Wnt antagonists or APC by hypermethylation or deletion are responsible for enhanced Wnt activity
in STSs.
Oncogenic EMT is a well known phenomenon for invasive
cancers, characterized by a conversion of epithelial cells into highly
motile mesenchymal cells (38). On a molecular level, EMT is defined
by loss of cell-cell adhesion, loss of epithelial differentiation, and
induction of mesenchymal markers. Here, we showed that liposarcoma cells underwent a partial reversal of the EMT after Frzb
transfection, shown by induction of epithelial markers (keratin 8/
keratin 18) and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin, and fibronectin) without significant change in
E-cadherin protein expression and EMT-related cell morphology.
Lack of E-cadherin changes may be due to complex posttranscriptional and/or translational regulation in this cell line (39). This

partial EMT reversal after Frzb transfection is accompanied by
reduced motility and invasive capacity of liposarcoma cells. These
data confirmed our recent reports on EMT reversal in prostate
cancer PC-3 and osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell lines by Frzb and
DNLRP5 (3, 40). Slug and Twist, major transcriptional factors
regulating the EMT process, have been shown to function as Wnt
target genes (41, 42). Thus, our results strongly suggest that Slug and
Twist are the transcriptional factors responsible for Frzb-induced
EMT reversal.
In addition to c-Met, several studies have indicated that MMP-2
plays an important role in tumor growth and invasiveness (43, 44).
The suppression of cellular invasion in vitro and lung metastasis
formation in vivo by secreted Wnt antagonists Frzb and DNLRP5 is
associated with significant down-regulation of pro-MMP-2 and its
enzyme activity (Fig. 4C). A recent investigation by Wu et al. (25)
suggests that MMP-2 is also a direct transcriptional target of Wnt.
Therefore, secreted antagonists, such as Frzb or DNLRP5, may
inhibit MMP-2 through direct modulation of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity in STS cells.
In conclusion, secreted Wnt antagonists Frzb and DNLRP5
inhibited Wnt signaling, leading to down-regulation of several
potential Wnt target genes (e.g., c-Met, Slug, Twist, MMP-2) in STS
cell lines. Given the involvement of Wnt target genes in sarcoma
progression (11, 32, 45) and the pronounced inhibitory effects of

Frzb and DNLRP5 on tumorigenesis, invasion, and EMT reported in
this study, secreted Wnt antagonists deserve further investigation
as a new strategy for treatment of human sarcoma. Importantly,
a secreted Wnt antagonist consisting of the CRD of Fz8 fused
with human IgG has recently showed potent antitumor efficacy in
animal models of teratocarcinoma (46). These results strongly
suggest the feasibility of developing Frzb fusion protein as a new
therapeutic agent. Further studies in our laboratories are in
progress to establish the stability, bioavailability, and antitumor
efficacy of Frzb fusion protein in animal models.
