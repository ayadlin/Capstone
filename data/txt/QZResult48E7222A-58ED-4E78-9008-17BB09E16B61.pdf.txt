ABSTRACT
Cellular senescence evasion caused by the inactivation of tumor suppressive
programs is implicated in tumor initiation and therapeutic resistance. Our previous
study has shown that the downregulation of growth arrest and DNA damage 45G
(GADD45G) contributes to senescence bypass in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Here, we report that the Smad-interacting protein-1 (SIP1) is transcriptionally
activated and functions critically in the GADD45G-induced tumor cell senescence.
Knockdown of SIP1 significantly abrogates the suppressive effects of GADD45G on
the growth of xenografted liver tumor in vivo. The essential role of SIP1 in GADD45G
activities is further validated in the model of the proteasome inhibitor MG132-induced
cell senescence. We further show that JNK but not p38 MAPK activation is involved in
the GADD45G-mediated SIP1 upregulation, and that JNK inhibition counteracts the
GADD45G-induced cellular senescence. More importantly, we show that GADD45G
and SIP1 expression are coincidently downregulated in primary human HCC tissues.
Together, our results establish that the dowregulation of GADD45G-SIP1 axis may
contribute to cellular senescence evasion and HCC development.

INTRODUCTION

premature senescence in murine HCCs [7]. miR-34a
regulates cellular senescence through the modulation of
telomere pathway by targeting the c-Myc and FoxM1
gene in HCC tissues and cell lines [8]. In addition to the
functional defeats in the classical cell cycle check-points,
such as p53, retinoblastoma (Rb), and INK4a-ARF, the
dys-regulation of nonclassical senescence inducers, as
an independent or a complementary mechanism, may
be also required for senescence evasion and efficient
tumorigenesis [9-12].
Cell senescence, a physiological program of
terminal growth arrest in response to alterations of
telomeres or different forms of stress, is considered to be
a strong anticancer mechanism [13, 14]. Unlike reversible
cell cycle arrest (quiescence), a characteristic of senescent
cells is loss of proliferative potential, while the quiescent
cells still have the ability to restart proliferation [15].
There is a terminology named geroconversion for the
transition of proliferative arrest to irreversible senescence.
This process can be driven by growth-promoting pathways

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly lethal
cancer, is one of the most common tumors worldwide.
HCC development is usually associated with liver
cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis
C virus (HCV) infections [1]. Emerging evidence has
shown that in order to acquire the peculiarity of cellular
immortality, human tumors frequently exhibit loss of p53
and p16INK4a-Rb-medieated senescence program [2, 3].
Similarly, HCC tumor cells are also believed to bypass
hepatocellular senescence to gain immortality [4]. Indeed,
HCC is one of the major tumors displaying p53 mutations
and p16INK4a inactivation [5]. Downregulation of p16 via
DNA methylation is responsible for Hepatitis C virus Core
protein to overcome stress-induced premature senescence
in HCC [6]. Studies have shown that senescence process
can be reactivated in HCC cells if the protumorigenic
events are inactivated. For instance, the suppression of
c-myc oncogene results in tumor regression by inducing

such as mTOR pathway and suppressed by Rapamycin
[16, 17].
Growth arrest and DNA damage 45G (GADD45G)
encodes a stress-responsive protein that is involved in
DNA damage response and cell growth arrest through
modulating a number of cellular proteins, including the
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p21, Cdk1,
cdc2/cyclin B1, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
[18-21]. Moreover, GADD45G levels are remarkably
downregulated in the different types of solid tumors
compared to their corresponding normal tissues [22]. We
have previous shown that GADD45G can robustly elicit
HCC cell senescence independently of the functional
presence of p53, p16INK4a and Rb, and that GADD45G
downregulation may contribute to senescence bypass and
promote tumor growth in the development of HCC cells
[23]. However, the mechanisms underlying GADD45Gmediated antitumor activity are not well understood. In

this study, we show that the Smad-interacting protein-1
(SIP1) is a key effector downstream of GADD45G in
programming cellular senescence in liver tumor cells.
The coincident downregulation of GADD45G and
SIP1 in clinical HCCs further indicates the pathological
relevance of the deregulation of GADD45G-SIP1 axis in
the development of HCC.

RESULTS
SIP1 is required for GADD45G-induced tumor
cell senescence
In agreement with previous observation, we
confirmed that the induction of GADD45G expression
in Sk-Hep1 cells (Tet-on-GADD45G-Sk-Hep1) and

SMMC-7721 cells (Tet-on-GADD45G-SMMC-7721)
resulted in characteristic morphological changes common
in senescent cells and a dramatic increase in the proportion
of SA-β-Gal-staining positive cells (Figure 1A). Since
GADD45G-induced senescence is related to the repression
of hTERT, we therefore examined the change pattern of
the hTERT upstream regulatory genes, including SIP1,
FRK, MEN1, MCPH1 [24], in Sk-Hep1 and SMMC7721 cells with or without GADD45G induction. As
expected, GADD45G induction significantly inhibited
the expression of hTERT mRNA. Surprisingly, we found
that the levels of SIP1 mRNA were significantly elevated
in the cells upon GADD45G induction (Figure 1B, 1C).

The change in SIP1 mRNA expression was also reflected

at the protein levels in Sk-Hep1 and SMMC-7721 cells
upon GADD45G induction (Figure 1D, 1E). In addition,
GADD45G-induction of SIP1 expression similarly
occurred in H-Ras V12-transformed mouse p53-/- liver
progenitor cells (LPC-H-Ras V12 cells) (Figure 1F).
Previous work has revealed the roles of SIP1 in
negative regulation of hTERT and in reprogramming
replicative senescence in p53- and p16INK4a-dificient HCC
cells [25]. Therefore, we raised the question of whether
SIP1 induction is critical for GADD45G-induced tumor
cell senescence. We treated Sk-Hep1 and SMMC-7721
cells with siRNA targeting SIP1 or the control siRNA

was confirmed by Western blot. (E-F) hTERT mRNA levels were measured in Tet-on-GADD45G-Sk-Hep1 (E) and Tet-on-GADD45GSMMC-7721 (F) cells with the indicated treatments. Data shown are mean ± SD from three independent experiments (*P < 0.05, **P <

for 24 hours and then cultured these cells with or without
DOX (Tet-on) for GADD45G induction. At 72 hours after
DOX treatment, we found that SIP1 knockdown efficiently
counteracted GADD45G-induced senescence, as scored
by the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells (Figure 2A,
2B). The efficiency of the siRNA for inhibiting SIP1
expression in cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis
(Figure 2C, 2D). Meanwhile, we detected whether the
SIP1 downregulation was able to prevent GADD45Gmediated inhibition of hTERT expression. Indeed, the
decrease in hTERT expression in the cells with GADD45G
induction was blocked by SIP1 inhibition (Figure 2E,
2F). Consistently, the results of cell-cycle analyses
demonstrated that SIP1 knockdown by siRNA efficiently
attenuated GADD45G-induced G1 arrest (Figure 2G,
2H). These results collectively indicate that SIP1 plays an

important role in GADD45G-induced cell senescence.

GADD45G and SIP1 function in the proteasome
inhibitor MG132-induced tumor cell senescence
Considering that GADD45 family proteins act as key
players in cellular stress responses, we examined whether
endogenous GADD45G-SIP1 activation contribute
to stresses-triggered cell senescence. We employed a
model of the drug MG132-induced cell senescence, in
which process the essential role of GADD45G has been
demonstrated [23]. As shown in Figure 3A, 3B, transient
treatment of Sk-Hep1 and SMMC-7721 with 3 µM
MG132 for 2 hours, significantly increased levels of SIP1
and GADD45G were displayed; however, in the cells

pretreated with siRNA specific for GADD45G, levels of
SIP1 were accordingly downregulated. As expected, at
24 hours after MG132 treatment, approximately 60%80% of these cells were stained positively for SA-β-gal
activity, whereas knockdown of GADD45G by siRNA
markedly decreased the percentages of SA-β-gal-positive
cells (Figure 3C). Intriguingly, in the cells pretreated with

siRNA for the downregulation of SIP1, MG132-induced
cell senescence was profoundly abrogated (Figure 3D,
3E, 3F). These results suggest that the activation of
GADD45G-SIP1 axis may play a significant role in certain
drugs- mediated tumor cell growth arrest.

JNK activation is required for GADD45Ginduced SIP1 expression

JNK but not p38 MAPK activation that contributes to
GADD45G-induced SIP1 expression.

SIP1 inhibition abrogates GADD45G-mediated
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo

We next investigated the mechanisms underlying
SIP1 upregulation in GADD45G-induced cell senescence.
Previous evidence has shown that GADD45 family
proteins function as the stress sensors in cells through
activating p38 MAPK and JNK pathways [26, 27].
We therefore analyzed whether GADD45G-mediated
activation of these MAPK pathways was responsible
for SIP1 upregulation. As shown in Figure 4A, 4B,
after GADD45G induction for the indicated times, the
phosphorylation of JNK was substantially enhanced in
Sk-Hep1 and SMMC-7721 cells. To test whether JNK
inhibition is sufficient to suppress the GADD45G-induced
activation of SIP1, we treated Sk-Hep1 and SMMC7721 cells with JNK Inhibitor II for 1 hour and cultured
them for another 24 hours in the presence or absence
of GADD45G induction. The results showed that JNK
inhibition remarkably reduced the GADD45G-induced
upregulation of SIP1. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of
c-Jun, a transcription factor specifically phosphorylated
by JNK, increased after GADD45G induction and the
level of p-c-Jun decreased with JNK inhibitor treatment
(Figure 4C, 4D). c-Jun is a major component of activating
protein-1 (AP-1), which is a dimeric transcription
factor[28]. Based on previous studies, c-Jun is effective
in regulating SIP1 transcription via interacting with
the AP-1 binding sites within SIP1 locus [29-31]. We
further performed ChIP assays to test whether c-Jun
directly regulates SIP1 mRNA transcription in Sk-Hep1
and SMMC-7721 cells with GADD45G induction. It
was found that c-Jun could efficiently bind to the AP-1
cis-element located about 2.5kb downstream of the
transcription start site (TSS) in the SIP1 promoter (Figure
4E, 4F, and data not shown). Taken together, these data
indicate that JNK/c-Jun pathway directly activates SIP1
transcription. In addition, the cellular senescence induced
by GADD45G was profoundly reduced in cells with JNK
inhibitor pretreatment (Figure 4G, 4H).
We next examined whether p38 MAPK activation
could contribute to SIP1 expression and senescence
induction by GADD45G. Indeed, we observed an
increase in p38 MAPK activity in cells upon GADD45G
induction, as revealed by the levels of p-p38 and the
activation of its substrate HSP27. However, the treatment
of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, which efficiency
was confirmed by the decrease in levels of p-HSP27, did
not decrease SIP1 expression in cells with or without
GADD45G induction (Figure 4I, 4J). Intriguingly,
SB203580 treatment significantly inhibited senescence
induction as indicated by SA-β-gal staining in SkHep1 and SMMC-7721 cells (Figure 4K, 4L). It seems
likely that the involvement of p38 MAPK activation in
GADD45G-induced senescence is independent of SIP1
induction. Collectively, these results indicate that it is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We next investigated the effects of SIP1 expression
on the growth of liver tumor cells in vivo. Sk-Hep1
cells with Tet-on-GADD45G expression cassette were
infected with lentiviruses carrying shRNA against SIP1
or the control shRNA, respectively. These cells were
subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice and feed
with normal water or DOX-containing water to induce
GADD45G expression. All mice developed tumors at
day 41 after tumor cell injection. As expected, the mice
inoculated with tumor cells with GADD45G induction
(Tet+ GADD45G/Vector) developed visible tumors
much later than did the mice injected with the tumor
cells without inducible GADD45G expression (Control:
Tet- GADD45G/Vector). However, the average latency
for tumor onset in the group with shRNA-mediated SIP1
inhibition and GADD45G induction (Tet+ GADD45G/
shSIP1), was comparable to that in the groups without
GADD45G expression, and much shorter than that in the
group with GADD45G induction alone (Tet+ GADD45G/
Vector ) (Figure 5A, 5B). In addition, the average volume
of the tumors from the Tet+ GADD45G/shSIP1 group
was significantly larger than those in the Tet+ GADD45G/
Vector group (Figure 5A, 5C). Successful induction of
GADD45G and knockdown of SIP1 in the xenograft
model were verified by Western blot (Figure 5D). These
results indicated that the GADD45G-induced inhibition
of tumor growth was dependent on SIP1 upregulation.
Moreover, the immunostaining results showed that, in the
presence of GADD45G induction, the expression of the
proliferation marker Ki-67 was robustly augmented in the
tumor cells with SIP1 inhibition relative to those without
SIP1 shRNA expression (Figure 5E). Taken together, these
results clearly demonstrate that SIP1 downregulation
abolishes the GADD45G-mediated inhibition of tumor
growth in vivo.

GADD45G and SIP1 expression levels are
correlated in human hepatocellular carcinoma
In order to investigate the correlation between
GADD45G and SIP1 expression in human HCC samples,
IHC staining of GADD45G and SIP1 was performed on 40
pairs of human liver tissue sections, including non-HCC
and HCC tissues. We observed that both GADD45G and
SIP1 expression were coincidently downregulated in the
tissue sections from the same patient in HCC specimens
compared to non-HCC tissues (Figure 6A, 6B). Box-andwhisker plots showed that the levels of GADD45G and
SIP1 proteins were significantly lower in HCC sections
33641

than those in non-HCC tissues (P < 0.001) (Figure
6B). According to IHC scores of GADD45G and SIP1,
approximately 72.5% (29 of 40) of adjacent nontumor
regions showed GADD45G positivity (defined as score
greater than 4), whereas only 9 of 40 (22.5%) HCC
tissues were positive for GADD45G staining; similarly,
positive staining of SIP1 was detected in approximately
92.5% (37 of 40) of nontumor sections and in 25% (10
of 40) of tumor areas (data not shown). Of note, there
was a significant difference in SIP1 expression between
GADD45G-negative and -positive tumors by statistical
analysis (Figure 6C, left). When categorized with SIP1
expression in HCC tissues, the negative group had
remarkably lower GADD45G expression than the positive

group (Figure 6C, right). Overall, these results based on
clinical HCC samples showed that GADD45G protein
levels correlated with the abundance of SIP1 protein,
indicating that GADD45G has a major role in controlling
SIP1 expression in human HCC.

DISCUSSION
Stress sensors GADD45 family proteins have been
implicated in the integration of cellular stress signals that
regulates cell survival, proliferation and differentiation.
GADD45G functions as a tumor suppressive gene via
activating an array of downstream effectors to induce
cell growth arrest. Particularly, GADD45G can strongly

elicit cellular senescence in HCC cells independently
of the function of p53, p16 and Rb. In this study, our
observations show that SIP1 induction is essential for the
stress sensor GADD45G-mediated tumor cell senescence,
and that the GADD45G-SIP1 axis is downregulated in
clinical HCC.
SIP1, a member of the δ-crystallin enhancer binding
factor 1 family, is initially recognized as a two-handed
zinc finger transcription factor that binds to Smad1, which
plays a critical role in TGF-β signaling and the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway [32, 33]. The
tumor suppressive activity of SIP1 has been appreciated
by several studies, in which SIP1 has been shown to
induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin D1
expression in squamous carcinoma cells, or to repress
hTERT expression, resulting in replicative senescence in
HCC cells [25, 34]. In addition, SIP1 has been found to
be downregulated in HCC because of aberrant promoter
methylation [35]. In accordance with previous studies,
our studies also show that the knockdown of SIP1 restores

hTERT expression and contributes to the bypass of cell
senescence induced by GADD45G. The present study
provides evidence that GADD45G is located upstream
of SIP1 in the induction of cellular senescence. It is
conceivable that the stress signaling elicited either by
environmental clues or by certain agents may affect
GADD45G-SIP1 pathway and thereby determine the
ultimate fate of the premalignant liver cells or the
progression of HCC.
In the present study, we show that JNK activation
is the downstream effector of GADD45G that induces
SIP1 expression. It has been well acknowledged that
JNK is promptly phosphorylated and activated in cellular
response to many environmental stresses [36]. JNK
activation controls diverse cellular functions such as cell
proliferation, aging and apoptosis [37]. For instance,
JNK phosphorylates its downstream FOXO4, leading to
upregulation of MnSOD expression and EPC senescence
[38]. Similarly, PAB triggers a ROS-JNK-p53 positive
feedback loop that is a key event in PAB-induced

senescence [39]. In line with our observation that ectopic
GADD45G expression induces cell senescence and
activates the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, GADD45
proteins have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at
G2/M phase in HepG2 hepatoma cells, wherein the
p38 MAPK and JNK act critically [40]. Of note, our
results further delineate the distinct roles of p38 MAPK
and JNK activation in the GADD45G-induced SIP1
expression and cellular senescence, since the p38 MAPK
inhibitor SB203580 suppressed the GADD45G-induced
cell senescence but did not change the levels of SIP1.
Therefore, p38 MAPK activation and SIP1 induction
are two independent events downstream of GADD45G,
but, they are functionally integrated in the process of the
GADD45G-induced cellular senescence.
We have also reported that GADD45G induces
cell senescence by inhibiting Jak/Stat3 activation in
HCC cells [23]. Our studies demonstrated that both Stat3
dephosphorylation and SIP1 upregulation contributed
to GADD45G-mediated repression of hTERT. With the
approaches of Stat3 reactivation by a constitutively active
Stat3 mutant and SIP1 knockdown, however, we did not
find a mutual regulation between Stat3 signaling and SIP1
expression in the GADD45G-induced cell senescence
(data not shown). Strikingly, either Stat3 reactivation or
SIP1 inhibition can efficiently counteract GADD45Ginduced cell senescence, indicating that Stat3 inhibition
and SIP1 activation are parallel, but both of them are
essential in GADD45G-induced cell senescence.
Our study demonstrates that decreased GADD45G
expression correlated with SIP1 downregultion in clinical
HCC tissues, indicating a pathological relevance of the
GADD45G-SIP1 axis in HCC development. Considering
the efficient activity of GADD45G in triggering
HCC cell senescence and suppressing tumor growth,
pharmacological activation of GADD45G-SIP1 pathway
may have a therapeutic potential for HCC patients,
especially for those with the defects in p53/p16 or Rb
pathways.

fetal liver progenitor cells (LPCs) were isolated from p53-/mice as described previously [41, 42] and cultured for the
retroviral delivery of H-Ras V12. All of the cell lines were
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Lentivirus infection and RNA interference
To establish cell lines with inducible expression
of GADD45G, FLAG-tagged human GADD45G cDNA
was cloned into pTRIPZ lentiviral vectors (a Tet-on
expression vector, Open Biosystems, USA). To produce
lentiviral particles, plasmids were transfected into
HEK293T packaging cells by using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The stable GADD45Goverexpressing cells were selected with 5µg/mL of
puromycin for 1 week. The small interfering RNA
(siRNA) against GADD45G (SASI_Hs01_00036488)
was designed and synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. The
siRNA against SIP1 was synthesized at Invitrogen and
the target sequence was as follows: 5′-GCAUGUAUGCAUGUGACUU-3′. Lentivirus-based knockdown
of SIP1 is achieved by construction of pPRIME-CMVdsRed-FF3 containing the SIP1-targeted sequence.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA were extracted from tumor cell
lines using the RNAiso Reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China), and cDNA was prepared using primeScript
RT Master kit (Takara). The genes of interest were
quantitated by quantitative real-time PCR (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (TaKaRa). Primers used for reactions are
as follows: 5’-AAACAAGCCAATCCCAGGAG-3’
and
5’-GGGTTGGCAATACCGTCATC-3’
for
SIP1; 5’-CGGAAGAGTGTCTGG-AGCAA-3’ and
5’-GGATGAAGCGGAGTCTGGA-3’ for hTERT;
5’-ATCACAGG-TTGGAGCCCAGTA-3’
and
5’-CTACCCAGGCATGATCCTCAG-3’ for MEN1;
5’-AGAAAAGACGAGATGGCTCCAG-3’
and 5’-ATCTTCCGATTGCTCCAAA-GAA-3’ for
FRK;
5’-TGGTCATCCAATGGAACAGAAA-3’
and 5’-TGCTCTGG-TAGCCATCTTTGAA-3’ for
MCPH1; 5’-TCCTGTTCGACAGTCAGCCGCA-3’ and
5’-ACCAGGCGCCCAATACGACCA-3’ for GAPDH.
The mRNA level of specific genes was normalized against
human GAPDH.

Western blot analysis

Immunohistochemistry staining

Cell lysates were suspended in RIPA lysis buffer
(Beyotime, Nantong, China) including Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Protein concentrations
were determined by BCA assay. Equal amounts of proteins
(100µg) were separated on 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE, then
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall, Glen Cove,
NY, USA). After being blocked with 5% BSA for 1 hour,
the filters were incubated with the primary antibodies
at 4°C overnight and incubation with the secondary
antibody for 1.5 hours, and the bound was detected with
the ChemiDocTM XRS system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). The antibodies used are as follows: anti-SIP1, antiGADD45G, anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA); anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/
Tyr182), anti-p38, anti-phospho-JNK1/2 (Thr183/185),
anti-JNK1/2, anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-c-Jun
(Cell Signaling Technology; CST, Danvers, MA,USA);
anti-phospho-HSP27 (Ser82) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY,
USA); anti-HSP27 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA).

Immunohistochemistry was performed on
the tumor sections from sacrificed mice with tumor
xenografts to determine the expression of Ki67 (42031, Epitomics, dilution 1:100). Tissue sections were
deparaffinized and treated with citrate buffer (pH6.0)
for antigen retrieval. The sections were incubated with
primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing, the
sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Next,
the slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 90
seconds with diaminobenzidine (Metal Enhanced DAB
substrate Kit, 34065, ThermoScientific, USA). The slides
were washed with distilled water and counterstained
with hematoxylin for 30 seconds (Beyotime, Shanghai,
China), washed twice with distilled water and examined
using a brightfield microscope. Human HCC tissue
microarrays were commercially from the Xi’an Alena
Biotech Company, and this study was conducted under
the approval of the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Cancer
Institute. GADD45G (NBP1-55835, NOVUS Biologicals,
dilution 1:150) and SIP1 (ab25837, Abcam, dilution
1:150) staining were reported separately according to the
German semiquantitative scoring system. In brief, the
percentage of the stained cells was classified as follows:
0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), and 4 (76100%); the staining intensity was graded relatively as :
0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong).
The final immunoreactivity scores were obtained by the
formula: IHC scores=percentage score × intensity score.

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity
assay
To detect the senescence ratio of cells after
treatment, SA-β-gal activity was determined by using the
SA-β-gal kit (Beyotime , Nantong, China) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The SA-β-Gal-positive cells
were expressed as a percentage of total cells.

Tumor xenograft model

Cell-cycle analysis

A total of 8×106 viable cells were resuspended in
equal volumes of PBS and injected subcutaneously in male
BALB/c nude mice (6-8 weeks of age). The mice bearing
Tet-on-GADD45G-Sk-Hep1/Vector or Tet-on-GADD45GSk-Hep1/shSIP1 were randomly divided into two groups
(five mice in each group). One group was given with 2
mg/mL DOX in the drinking water and the other was
given normal water. The tumor volumes were monitored
by bidimensional measurements using a caliper. Tumorbearing mice were killed at 50 days after inoculation, and
then the tumors were removed for further study. All the
animal protocols in this study were approved by the Ethics
Committee of Shanghai Cancer Institute.

Cells were harvested at indicated times, fixed
with 70% cold ethanol. Propidium iodide was added to
the cells and the samples were then analyzed by FCM
(Becton‑Dickinson, California, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin was immunoprecipitationed with
an ChIP assay kit (17-371, Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The
antibody used in ChIP experiment is anti-c-Jun from Cell
Signaling Technology. The immunoprecipitated DNA was
analyzed by qPCR. Primer sequences used were: forward:
5’-CGCTTTGTGTTTGTTACTGTTTGG-3’ and reverse:
5’-TTCCCTCATACGGTCAGGAGTTAT-3’.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
16.0. For the in vivo studies, the percentage of mice tumorfree in each group was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier’s
survival analysis. For the in vitro studies, two-tailed t test
