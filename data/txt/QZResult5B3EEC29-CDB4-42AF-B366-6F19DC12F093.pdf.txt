BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) are active cytotoxic agents for the treatment
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS). A randomized trial comparing the efficacy
and toxicity of paclitaxel and PLD was performed, and the effects of therapy on symptom palliation and quality of
life were determined. METHODS: Patients with advanced HIV-associated KS were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m2 intravenously (iv) every 2 weeks or PLD at a dose of 20 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks. The
KS Functional Assessment of HIV (FAHI) quality of life instrument was used before and after every other treatment
cycle. RESULTS: The study included 73 analyzable patients enrolled between 1998 and 2002, including 36 in the
paclitaxel arm and 37 in the PLD arm; 73% of patients received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and 32%
had an undetectable viral load (<400 copies/mL). Treatment was associated with significant improvements in pain
(P ¼.024) and swelling (P < .001). Of the 36 patients who reported that pain interfered with their normal work or
activities at baseline, 25 (69%) improved. Of the 41 patients who reported swelling at baseline, 38 (93%) improved.
Comparing the paclitaxel and PLD arms revealed comparable response rates (56% vs 46%; P ¼.49), median progression-free survival (17.5 months vs 12.2 months; P ¼.66), and 2-year survival rates (79% vs 78%; P ¼.75), but somewhat
more grade 3 to 5 toxicity for paclitaxel (84% vs 66%; P ¼.077). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with either paclitaxel or
PLD appears to produce significant improvements in pain and swelling in patients with advanced, symptomatic, HIVC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a neoplasm caused by the KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).1 Although the introduction of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a markedly reduced incidence of KS associated with HIV infection and the
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),1-7 the disease still develops in approximately 15% of AIDS patients in
developed countries and may occur despite well-controlled HIV infection.8,9 KS incidence remains very high in SubSaharan Africa, where coinfection with KSHV and HIV is far more common than in high-income locales and HAART is
not as widely available.10,11 Furthermore, although KS may regress after the initiation of HAART, this has been documented primarily among patients with limited KS, whereas patients with advanced, symptomatic KS generally receive
HAART combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy.6

Liposomal anthracyclines are safe and effective for
the treatment of AIDS-related KS. Randomized trials
conducted before the introduction of HAART found
them to be superior to combination therapy with bleomycin and vincristine, with or without nonliposomal doxorubicin.12-14 Furthermore, a trial that compared the
combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)
and HAART with HAART alone demonstrated a significantly higher response rate for the combination.15 Paclitaxel has also demonstrated efficacy in phase 2 trials in
patients with AIDS-related KS whose disease had progressed after receiving 1 chemotherapy regimens.16,17
Given the single-agent activity of both PLD and
paclitaxel, we sought to compare their effectiveness as initial cytotoxic therapy in a phase 3 trial for advanced,
symptomatic KS in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival
(PFS). As a secondary objective, we sought to compare the
regimens with respect to quality of life (QoL). The trial was
terminated prematurely because of slow accrual. We report
herein the results of the trial in 73 evaluable patients, which
provided a sufficient sample size to estimate antitumor efficacy and toxicity for each treatment arm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible patients had a serologic diagnosis of HIV infection and biopsy-proven, measurable KS with any of the
following features: progressive cutaneous disease; symptomatic oropharyngeal or conjunctival lesions; visceral
involvement; or tumor-related lymphedema, ulceration,
or pain. Patients had to be aged 18 years and have an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy for KS was not permitted. Radiotherapy could
not have been delivered to marker lesions and had to be
discontinued 7 days before randomization. Other
requirements included adequate bone marrow function
(absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1000/mm3, hemoglobin 8 g/dL, and platelet count 50,000/mm3), renal
function (creatinine 2.1 mg/dL), and hepatic function
(aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase
5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and bilirubin
<1.5 times the ULN [unless isolated elevation of conjugated bilirubin was associated with indinavir administration]). Pregnant or nursing women were excluded and
women of childbearing potential and sexually active men
were advised to use effective contraception. Other exclu-

3970

sion criteria included a history of cardiac insufficiency
(New York Heart Association Functional Classification of
II or higher); active, untreated infection; prior or concomitant malignancy (other than curatively treated in situ cervical carcinoma or basal/squamous cell skin carcinoma);
or sensitivity to Escherichia coli (E. coli)-derived proteins
that would preclude the use of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Patients were required to be receiving a stable antiretroviral drug regimen for at least 14 days
before study enrollment.
Treatment Plan
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb [BMS], Princeton,
NJ) at a dose of 100 mg/m2, infused intravenously (iv)
over 3 hours every 14 days or PLD (Doxil; Ortho Biotech,
Horsham, PA) at a dose of 20 mg/m2, infused iv over 30
to 60 minutes every 21 days. Paclitaxel was provided to
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) by BMS, whereas
commercially available PLD was used for trial participants. Treatment cycles were repeated if the ANC was at
least 1000/uL, the platelet count was at least 50,000/uL,
and the patient had satisfactorily recovered from nonhematologic toxicity to grade 1 or less. Dose modifications
were required for grade 3 to 4 hematologic, skin, hepatic,
and other toxicities. Premedication given before each
paclitaxel infusion included dexamethasone (at a dose of
20 mg iv or orally), diphenhydramine (at a dose of
50 mg), and cimetidine (at a dose of 300 mg) or an alternative H2 blocker. Erythropoietin use was allowed. If
neutropenia of grade 3 or higher occurred within 24 hours
before the scheduled day of treatment, G-CSF was administered in all subsequent cycles (at a dose of 5 lg/kg starting on the day after chemotherapy and continuing until
neutrophil recovery). Patients with an absolute CD4positive (þ) count <200 cells/mm3 or <15% CD4þ
lymphocytes were required to receive Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Patients with a complete
response (CR) remained on therapy for 2 cycles beyond
the first documented CR. Patients with a partial response
(PR) or stable disease remained on therapy until KS progressed or unacceptable toxicity developed.
Response and Toxicity Criteria
Tumor responses were graded as CR, PR, stable disease,
or disease progression using previously described criteria.18 The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0)
were used to evaluate and grade adverse events. KS

evaluation and staging were performed as previously
described18 at baseline and after every third cycle.
QoL Assessments
The KS Functional Assessment of HIV (FAHI) QoL
instrument,19,20 with 3 supplemental questions addressing pain, swelling, and satisfaction with physical appearance, was used to collect QoL data in 5 categories:
physical well-being, emotional well-being, functional and
global well-being, social well-being, and cognitive functioning. QoL data were collected before every other cycle.
The FAHI is part of the Functional Assessment of
Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) measurement system,
which assesses both generic and disease-specific QoL for
patients with chronic illnesses including malignancy and
HIV and is based on a core instrument, the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT).21 Nine HIV-specific items were subsequently developed using interviews
with 5 HIV specialists and 15 patients. QoL assessment
was performed at baseline and after every third cycle.
Design and Analysis
Randomization was stratified based on tumor classification (T0 or T1),22 CD4þ count (<150 cells/mm3 or
150 cells/mm3), and viral load (<400 copies/mL, >400
to <5000 copies/mL, or 5000 copies/mL). The trial
was originally designed with PFS as the primary endpoint.
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression, censored at the date of last disease assessment for those patients who had not developed disease
progression. On the basis of results of prior studies of
PLD and paclitaxel,12-14 we assumed that the median PFS
for the patients treated with PLD would be 6 months and
would be 9 months for those treated with paclitaxel. The
sample size of 216 eligible patients provided an 80%
power to detect at least a 3-month difference in the median PFS while allowing for 2 interim (at 35% and 70%,
respectively, of the statistical information time) and 1
final analysis. The sample size and power were based on a
2-sided log-rank test using an overall significance level of
.05. The group sequential method of O’Brien and Fleming23 was used for the 2-sided test. Secondary endpoints
included changes in health-related QoL, overall and complete response rates, toxicity, and effects on HIV infection. On the basis of prior studies demonstrating the
overall response rate to PLD to be approximately 70%,
216 patients would provide at least 83% power to detect
differences of 17% in the overall response rate.

The binomial proportion and its 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) were used to estimate the tumor
response rate. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method and the median PFS with its 95% CI.24 For each
of the 5 categories of the FAHI, the Student t test for
paired data was used to evaluate changes from the pretreatment value to the best value observed while the
patient received treatment. There were also 3 KS-specific
supplemental statements. Agreement with these statements was graded using a Likert scale from 0 to 4, with 0
indicating ‘‘not at all’’ and 4 indicating ‘‘very much.’’
Changes from pretreatment value to the best value
observed on treatment for the KS-specific statements were
evaluated using the kappa statistic. All P values shown in
the analysis were 2-sided.
Informed Consent and Regulatory Approval
The study was reviewed and approved by the Cancer Evaluation Therapy Program of the NCI, and by the institutional review board at each participating institution
(Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT00003350). All patients
provided written informed consent, which was reviewed
and approved by the local institutional review board.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
This trial originated in ECOG, but was later expanded to
include enrollment from the AIDS Malignancy Consortium. Of a planned accrual of 240 patients, 89 were
accrued at 16 trials sites between November 20, 1998 and
May 9, 2002. The ECOG Data Monitoring Committee
terminated the trial before reaching its accrual goal
because of slow accrual. Eleven patients were ineligible
(the majority because they had not been receiving antiretroviral therapy for >14 days), 4 never had therapy initiated, and no data were submitted for 1 patient. Therefore,
73 patients, 36 in the paclitaxel arm and 37 in the PLD
arm, were considered analyzable and included in the main
analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 73 analyzable patients. In general, the groups were well balanced
and there were no significant differences between the 2
treatment arms. The majority of the patients (97%) were
male, and approximately two-thirds had an advanced tumor stage (T1). The median age of the patients was 39
years in the paclitaxel arm and 36 years in the PLD arm.
Approximately 50% or more of the patients in each arm
were Hispanic or African American. Greater than half of
the patients in each arm had a CD4þ count <150 cells/
mm3, and 40% of patients in the paclitaxel arm and 46%

in the PLD arm had a prior history of opportunistic
infection.
At baseline, 53 of the 73 patients were receiving a
combination HAART regimen containing either a protease inhibitor (N ¼ 20), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor without a protease inhibitor (N ¼ 21), or
both (N ¼ 12). Approximately 33% of patients had a
baseline HIV viral load <400 copies/mL, and >40% had
a viral load 5000 copies/mL.
Treatment Administration
The median total number of chemotherapy cycles was 8
(range, 0-33 cycles) in the paclitaxel arm. Among the 35
patients in the PLD arm for whom data were available,
the median number of treatment cycles was 7 (range, 0-33
cycles). Table 2 summarizes the reasons for discontinuing
treatment. The most common reasons in both treatment
arms were patient withdrawal (25% in the paclitaxel arm
and 29.4% in the PLD arm) and toxicity (25% in paclitaxel arm and 14.5% in the PLD arm).

in the paclitaxel arm and 7 in the PLD arm. Using an
intent-to-treat analysis, the overall CR and PR rate was
56% (95% CI, 39-75%) for the paclitaxel arm and 46%
(95% CI, 30-62%) for the PLD arm (P ¼ .486). The CR
rate was 8% (95% CI, 7-19%) for the paclitaxel arm and
5% for the PLD arm (95% CI, 0.6-18%) (P ¼ .674).
There was no significant difference noted with regard to
response rate between patients receiving HAART at study
entry and those not receiving HAART.
Progression-Free Survival
Of the 73 evaluable patients, 4 patients who did not have
a disease assessment or progression date were initially
included in the analysis using a censored PFS value of 2
months. The median PFS was 17.5 months (95% CI,
12.8-21 months) for the paclitaxel arm and 12.2 months
(95% CI, 8.2-33.7 months) for the PLD arm (P ¼ .66)
(Fig. 1 Top). If the 4 patients who did not have disease
evaluation were excluded from the analysis (1 in the paclitaxel arm and 3 in the PLD arm), the median PFS was
17.5 months (95% CI, 12.8-21 months) for the paclitaxel
arm and 12.2 months (95% CI, 8.2-13.9 months) for the
PLD arm (P ¼ .653).

OS rate was 79% (95% CI, 62-96%) for the paclitaxel
arm and 78% (95% CI, 56-84%) for the PLD arm
(P ¼ .748). The median follow-up time for the 48 surviving patients in both treatment arms was 36 months
(range, 0.9-90.9 months).
Adverse Events
Toxicity data were available for 82 patients, and are summarized in Table 4. The most common grade 3 or 4
laboratory abnormalities were low CD4þ counts, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia. The overall incidence of grade 3 or greater toxicity was somewhat higher
in the paclitaxel arm (84% vs 66%; P ¼ .077), including
neutropenia (58% vs 41%; P ¼ .184). Grade 1 to 2 alopecia (57.8% vs 11%; P < .001) and sensory neuropathy
(26% vs 9%; P ¼ .045) were found to be significantly
more common in the paclitaxel treatment arm compared
with the PLD treatment arm. Hematologic toxicity was
not associated with the use of zidovudine, which has been
reported to be associated with anemia and neutropenia.25
Infection rates were similar (16% in the paclitaxel arm vs
14% in the PLD arm; P ¼ 1). There was 1 toxicity of
grade 5 (lethal) in the paclitaxel arm; the patient died of a
pulmonary embolism on Day 9.

There was a marginally significant (P ¼ .0582) difference in time to disease progression favoring patients

Quality of Life
Of the 73 analyzable patients in both treatment arms, 56
had FAHI QoL data available at baseline and during treatment, as shown in Table 5. There was no significant
change in the global FAHI score noted to be associated
with treatment, nor in the physical well-being or emotional well-being subscales; however, there was a trend
toward an improved functional and global well-being subscale, and there was significant improvement noted in
social well-being and cognitive function. There were also
significant differences reported between baseline and
treatment values for pain (P ¼ .024) and swelling (P <
.001), but not for satisfaction with appearance. Of the 36
patients who reported that pain interfered with their normal work or activities at baseline, 25 (69%) had improvement with treatment. Of the 41 patients who reported
swelling at baseline, 38 (93%) reported improvement
with treatment. None of the QoL measures was found to
be correlated with tumor response.

PLD and paclitaxel are both active cytotoxic agents for the
treatment of advanced, symptomatic KS. Because KS

treatment is considered palliative rather than curative, and
because each agent has a different spectrum of toxicity, we
sought to compare the effectiveness and toxicity of these 2
agents as initial therapy for patients with advanced KS.
We evaluated not only objective response and time to disease progression, but also used the FAHI QoL instrument
to capture symptomatic improvements that might be
afforded by each therapy.
The assumptions made in designing the trial were
based on data obtained before the widespread introduction of HAART. However, by the time the trial began to
accrue patients in late 1998, several such combination
antiretroviral regimens had been available for 1 to 2 years.
Although declines in the incidence of HIV-associated KS
had been noted before the availability of HAART, a more
precipitous decline occurred after HAART became widely
used in clinical practice.1-7 In addition, some patients
with established KS demonstrated spontaneous tumor
regression after the initiation of HAART therapy, and
HIV-associated KS was more frequently associated with an
indolent clinical course in the presence of HAART.26-31
These factors contributed to the slow accrual in our trial.
In addition, the subjects enrolled in both arms of the
current trial were found to have a much longer median
PFS compared with those treated in the pre-HAART

era.12,13,17 In fact, in both treatment arms, the median
PFS was approximately twice what was anticipated when
the protocol was designed. For the observed difference
(17.5 months for the paclitaxel arm and 12.2 months for
the PLD arm) to have been statistically significant would
have required 340 patients (ie, 170 patients per group),
suggesting that the concomitant administration of
HAART to the majority of patients led to the observed
increases.
Although this trial did not meet its prespecified
accrual goal, several conclusions may be drawn. First,
both paclitaxel and PLD are active agents for patients
with advanced, symptomatic KS treated in the HAART
era, with response rates in the range of 50% to 60%.
Second, these agents have somewhat different toxicity
profiles, with paclitaxel being associated with more grade
3 to 4 hematologic toxicity and more alopecia and sensory neuropathy. Third, although we found no correlation between objective response and relief of tumorassociated symptoms, the majority of patients who
reported pain or tumor-associated edema at baseline
demonstrated improvement in these symptoms, and
overall social well-being and cognitive functioning were
found to improve with treatment. These findings suggest that even among those individuals not meeting the

criteria for objective tumor response, chemotherapy may
provide clinical benefits with respect to KS-related
symptoms, but they also may reflect the long-term benefits of coadministered HAART. These results also confirm earlier findings by Osoba et al,32 who reported
significant improvements in pain and energy/fatigue,
and possible improvements in general health, social
functioning, and overall QoL in patients with AIDS/KS
treated with PLD in the pre-HAART era. However, in
that study, the investigators used a different instrument
to assess health-related QoL and associations with objective response were not sought. Lastly, approximately
75% of patients were alive at 2 years irrespective of the
initial chemotherapy treatment given. This suggests that
each treatment may be an acceptable option, although
the administration of HAART during and/or after the
receipt of chemotherapy likely made a major contribution to OS.
In conclusion, PLD and paclitaxel appear to be
active first-line agents for the treatment of advanced,
symptomatic KS, producing comparable clinical outcomes but with somewhat different adverse event profiles.
