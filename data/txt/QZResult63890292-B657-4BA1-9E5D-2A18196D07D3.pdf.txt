ABSTRACT
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common
cancer, with 600,000 new cases every year worldwide. Although chemotherapeutics
exist, five-year survival is only 50%. New strategies to overcome drug resistance
are required to improve HNSCC treatment. Curcumin-difluorinated (CDF), a synthetic
analog of curcumin, was packaged in liposomes and used to evaluate growth inhibition
of cisplatin resistant HNSCC cell lines CCL-23R and UM-SCC-1R generated from the
parental cell lines CCL-23 and UM-SCC-1 respectively. Growth inhibition in vitro and
expression levels of the CD44 (cancer stem cell marker), cytokines, and growth factors
were investigated after liposomal CDF treatment. The in vivo growth inhibitory effect
of liposomal CDF was evaluated in the nude mice xenograft tumor model of UM-SCC1R and the inhibition of CD44 was measured. Treatment of the resistant cell lines in
vitro with liposomal CDF resulted in a statistically significant growth inhibition (p <
0.05). The nude mice xenograft study showed a statistically significant tumor growth
inhibition of UM-SCC-1R cells and a reduction in the expression of CD44 (p < 0.05),
indicating an inhibitory effect of liposomal CDF on CSCs. Our results demonstrate that
delivery of CDF through liposomes may be an effective method for the treatment of
cisplatin resistant HNSCC.

INTRODUCTION

advancements, the overall survival rate for patients with
advanced HNSCC has remained poor. The five-year
survival rate for all patients with head and neck cancer is
57%, and for patients with stage III and IV oral cancers
the survival rate is 10-20% [3, 4]. Close to half of these
(30 to 50%) patients develop local or regional recurrence
and another 10-40% of patients develop second primary
tumors of the aerodigestive tract due to field cancerization
[5].

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
affects 600,000 people worldwide annually, including
42,000 in the United States [1, 2]. HNSCC includes oral,
laryngeal and pharyngeal malignancies, with about 40% of
these arising in the oral cavity. Current treatment methods
for advanced head and neck cancer include radiation
therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. Despite medical

Cisplatin or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
(CDDP) is a widely used drug in the class of platinumbased chemotherapies which include carboplatin and
oxaliplatin. The platinum compounds work by the
formation of DNA adducts within cells, leading to
apoptosis and cellular senescence. The toxic effects of
cisplatin are dose dependent and include renal, otologic,
and bone marrow suppression. Cisplatin therapy alone
has not been found to be effective in treating patients
with HNSCC, and it is frequently used in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy
[4, 5]. Certain head and neck cancers have been found to
be resistant to cisplatin, a feature that conveys a poorer
prognosis with a tendency for disease recurrence [4, 5].
The precise molecular mechanism of cisplatin is not
known, but there is evidence from our studies that cisplatin
works through p16 and p53 dependent mechanisms [6,
7]. Both p16 and p53 are tumor suppressor genes, and
mutations in these genes are linked to cancer development
and cisplatin resistance which results in selective growth
of cancer stem cells (CSCs). There have been ongoing
investigations of alternative therapies with reduced
morbidity and toxicity to minimize the adverse effect of
cancer treatments.
CSCs represent cells that undergo an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the activation of
growth factors [8]. These cells show higher expression
levels of cell surface and metabolic markers such as CD44,
CD133, and ALDH, and these markers have been used for
the isolation of CSCs [9-11]. Hallmarks of CSCs include
self-renewal, ability to form spheroids and colonies in soft
agar, formation of tumors in nude mice, and differentiation
into stem and non-stem cells in vivo [11]. Existence of
CSCs has been demonstrated in leukemias, lymphomas,
and solid tumors. CD44 and ALDH have been the markers
of choice for the isolation of CSCs from colon, lung,
breast, head and neck, and pancreatic tumors [11-14].
Compared to the greater than 106 tumor cells required
to induce tumors in nude mice, less than 1000 CSCs are
sufficient to form tumors, indicating the existence of CSCs
in the bulk tumor population. Tumors formed in vivo from
CD44hi cells are shown to contain both CD44hi and CD44lo
cells, pointing to the differentiation capacity of CSCs [15].
Enhanced expression of cell surface markers in
CSCs is also associated with increased expression of
cytokines and growth factors through the activation of
transcription factors. Among the transcription factors,
NF-κB seems to be a central player in the activation of
jak/stat, AKT, and other signaling pathways [16]. NF-κB
functions in a variety of human diseases such as asthma,
AIDS, septic shock, and cancer. This protein is activated
in many cell types in response to a broad range of
stimuli which include mitogens, inflammatory cytokines,
extracellular stress, cigarette smoke, and UV irradiation
[17, 18]. NF-κB activation occurs as it is transported from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon phosphorylation and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

degradation of its inhibitory molecule IκBα [19]. The IκB
kinase (IKK) is a complex consisting of three proteins
IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ or NF-κB essential modulator
(NEMO). IKK is responsible for the phosphorylation of
the IκBα subunit of IκB, resulting in the ubiquitination
and rapid degradation of IκBα [19]. We have previously
shown that p16 mediated down-regulation of NF-κB in
cisplatin sensitive cells is achieved in association with an
E3 ubiquitin ligase gigaxonin, a protein mutated in giant
axonal neuropathies [7]. This indicates that the loss of p16
expression in cisplatin resistant cells is connected to the
enhanced expression of NF-κB. The studies suggest small
molecule inhibitors could also be identified for the downregulation of NF-κB.
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), commonly known
as the spice turmeric, is derived from the rhizome of the
East Indian plant Curcuma longa. It has been consumed
as a dietary supplement for centuries and is considered
pharmacologically safe [20]. Epidemiological studies
attribute the low incidence of colon cancer in India to the
chemopreventive and antioxidant properties of diets rich
in curcumin [20]. Curcumin is soluble only in organic
solvents, but liposomal formulations have been used
in growth inhibitory studies of pancreatic and head and
neck cancers [21, 22]. We have shown that curcumin
sensitizes head and neck cancer cell lines to cisplatin and
acts through an AKT independent pathway. Although
a number of human clinical trials have been carried out
using curcumin, the results have not been successful due
to poor absorption of curcumin by the gastrointestinal
system. Attempts are being made to isolate curcumin
derivatives or analogs that have better absorption qualities
and enhanced cell-killing properties.
Curcumin-difluorinated (CDF), a synthetic analog
of curcumin, has been shown to be more effective than
curcumin in the growth inhibition of a number of human
tumor cell lines [23-26]. However, curcumin and CDF
have never been shown to directly inhibit growth of CSCs
in HNSCC. In this study, we show the growth inhibition of
curcumin and CDF on isolated and CSC enriched cisplatin
resistant head and neck cancer cell lines.

RESULTS
Cisplatin targets p16 positive and CD44lo cells
Studies from our own and other laboratories have
shown that cisplatin kills differentiating CD44lo cells
without any effect on p16 non-expressing CD44hi cells.
It should be noted that all cells express CD44 in variable
levels meaning both CD44lo and CD44hi cells exist within
cancer cell lines and primary tumors.
To determine cisplatin’s effect on p16 and CD44lo
cells, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting

(FACS) analysis on p16 nuclear positive and cisplatin
sensitive CCL-23 [7], and p16 nuclear absent and cisplatin
resistant UM-SCC-1 cells with fluorescent tagged p16 and
CD44 antibodies. A 4.4% to 14.8% shift to the lower p16
expressing cells was seen in CCL-23 cells (Figure 1A),
indicating cell death of p16 nuclear positive cells. UMSCC-1 cells did not have a similar shift. Although there
was cell death in the absence of nuclear p16 expression as
measured by the live cell count assay, UM-SCC-1 cells did
not show a reduction in the level of p16 expression.
To find out whether cisplatin targeted CD44lo
cells, UM-SCC-1 cells were treated with 10 and 20 µM

cisplatin, 3.0 and 6.0 µg/mL respectively, for 5 hours and
grown in cisplatin free medium. Live cells were counted
24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment then evaluated by
FACS to determine the fraction of CD44hi and CD44lo
cells. The MTT assay 48 hours after treatment showed
a 25% increased cell death in 10 µM cisplatin treated
cells and a 50% increased cell death with the 20 µM
cisplatin treated cells. FACS analysis showed a greater
shift towards CD44hi cells with higher concentrations of
cisplatin treatment (Figure 1B). Differentiation of CD44hi
to CD44lo cells was observed in each of the treatment sets,
confirming the stem cell nature of CD44hi cells. Thus there

a shift in p16 positive cells to the lower p16 expressing cells (4.4% becomes 14.8%) pointing to the killing of p16 positive cells. Such a shift
is not observed in cisplatin treated UM-SCC1 cells. These cells have cytoplasmic p16 expression, and are devoid of nuclear p16 expression
indicating the targeting of nuclear p16 in CCL-23 cells by cisplatin. B. Treatment of UM-SCC-1 cells with 10 and 20 µM (3.0 and 6.0 µg/
mL respectively) cisplatin concentrations show a shift from CD44lo to CD44hi expressing cells with increasing cisplatin concentration; the
fraction of CD44hi cells increased from 38.57% in the control cells to 80.77% and 85.11% one day after treatment with 10 µM and 20 µM
concentrations, respectively. A similar trend is seen at day 2 in cisplatin treated samples. Differentiation of CD44hi to CD44lo cells is also
observed at different days. MTT assays have shown a 25% and 55% cell death with 10 µM or 20 µM cisplatin treatment respectively in 3
days after which the cells remain resistant to cisplatin treatment.

indicated that cisplatin treatment of the drug resistant cell
line UM-SCC-1 induces apoptotic cell death of CD44 lo
expressing cells which lead to an overall increase in CD44
expression of surviving cells.

Retention of CD44hi cells after cisplatin treatment

CD44hi cells exhibit properties of cancer stem cells

If cisplatin targets CD44lo cells, a shift in CD44
expression and cell death should be observed in the cells.
We used a CD44 stain to observe this shift and with
annexin stain to account for apoptosis. UM-SCC-1 cells
were double stained 48 hours after a 5 hour cisplatin
treatment. Cisplatin treatment resulted in 3-fold increase
of dead and apoptotic cells from 7.67 to 22.54 (Figure
2). A similar fraction of cell death was also observed in
CD44 and annexin doubly stained cells (see the sum of the
right quadrants of the bottom panels; control 9.17 vs 25.73
in treated cells). Cell death was accompanied by a shift
toward CD44hi cells, and CD44lo cells were reduced from
11.54% to 2.23% after treatment (Figure 2). There was
also a loss in CD44hi cells from 79.29 to 72.04, possibly
representing those differentiating to CD44lo expressing
cells. The results also showed a 2.6-fold increase in the
cell fraction representing CD44hi cells after cisplatin
treatment from 265.03 to 707.62. These results clearly

To determine whether CD44hi cells exhibit CSC
properties such as cisplatin resistance and formation of
higher numbers of larger soft agar colonies, the untreated
UM-SCC-1 cells were sorted for high or low CD44
expression. The top 10% of high and low expressing cells
were collected as CD44hi and CD44lo cells, respectively.
The sorted cells were grown in RPMI media for 48 hours
for the cells to recover, grown overnight in serum free
media and then treated with 20 µM cisplatin for 5 hours
in serum containing media. Growth assay in comparison
to the unfractionated UM-SCC-1 cells showed a higher
growth rate in CD44hi cells indicating that CD44hi cells
are resistant to cisplatin treatment (Figure 3A). CD44lo
cells showed a slower growth rate than the unfractionated
cells indicating higher cell death. CD44hi cells also formed
larger and higher numbers of soft agar colonies than the
CD44lo cells (Figures 3B-3C). These results indicated that

cells after cisplatin treatment (see the circled data in the middle table, 265.03 vs. 707.62 cells).

demonstrated increased expression of IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10,
bFGF, VEGF, MMP-1, and MMP-9 growth factors in the
cisplatin resistant UM-SCC-1 cells (Figure 4A). Similarly
enhanced expression of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 cytokines
was also observed in cisplatin resistant CCL-23R cells
in comparison to the parental CCL23 cells (Figure 4B).
Higher expression of bFGF and MMP-9 growth factors
was seen in the cell free supernatants of cisplatin resistant
UM-SCC-1 and CCL-23R cells (data not shown). Elevated
expression of growth factors were related to AKT signaling
as evidenced by increased expression of AKT pathway
proteins GSK-3b and p70S6K in the cisplatin resistant cell
lines (Figure 4C). Overexpression of cytokines IL-6 and
IL-8 in the cisplatin resistant cell lines and their inhibition
by curcumin has also been demonstrated in single antigen
specific ELISA assays [27]. These results indicated a

and growth factors to cisplatin resistance in the HNSCC
cell lines.

Higher sensitivity of cisplatin resistant cell lines to
liposomal CDF

Curcumin treatment leads to the killing of CD44hi
cells

To compare the growth inhibitory effect of curcumin
and CDF, resistant HNSCC cell lines were treated with
liposomal curcumin and liposomal CDF. Cisplatin resistant
UM-SCC-1 cells (selected after growth in 3 µg/mL-10 µM
cisplatin) and cisplatin resistant CCL-23 cells (selected
after treatment with 6 µg/mL-20 µM cisplatin) were
selected and named UM-SCC-1R, CCL-23R respectively.
In the case of CCL-23R cells, a 50% cell death required
100 µM liposomal curcumin treatment. An equivalent cell
death was observed with 5.0 µM liposomal CDF treatment
indicating a 20 fold increased induction of cell death by
liposomal CDF (Figure 5B). Similarly an increased growth
inhibitory effect was also seen in UM-SCC-1R cells after
liposomal CDF treatment. In this case, a 45% cell growth
inhibition was achieved with 25 µM liposomal CDF
versus 100 µM liposomal curcumin (Figure 5C). A qRTPCR analysis showed a statistically significant reduction
in the expression of CD44 in liposomal CDF treated UMSCC-1 cell lines compared to the liposome alone treated
controls (Figure 5D). Although there was a reduction in
CD44 expression with liposomal CDF treatment of CCL23R cells, it did not reach a statistical significance. This
could be due to a low base level CD44 expression in
CCL-23R cells in comparison to the high base level CD44
expression in UM-SCC-1R cells. These results clearly

To find out whether CD44hi cells could be targeted
by curcumin, UM-SCC-1 cells were treated with suboptimal 50% concentration of cisplatin with and without
liposomal curcumin [28]. Cells were treated with 25 µM of
liposomal curcumin for 8 hours, and 10 µM cisplatin for 5
hours, 3 hours post-curcumin treatment. Cells were grown
for 48 hours post-treatment in drug free media then CD44
expression and cell death were evaluated. Cisplatin plus 25
µM liposome treated cells and untreated cells were used as
controls. In comparison to the untreated cells, there was a
28% cell death in cisplatin plus liposome treatment which
increased to 44% from cisplatin with liposomal curcumin
treatment, pointing to an additional 16% cell death through
curcumin in cisplatin resistant cells. The control cells and
cisplatin plus liposome treated cells have a similar ratio of
CD44hi and CD44lo cells reflecting cell death of both CD44
expression levels from cisplatin. However, there was an
additional 25% reduction in CD44hi cells in the cisplatin
plus liposomal curcumin treatment indicating that CD44hi
cells were targeted by the addition of liposomal curcumin
(Figure 5A).

described [29]. The results indicated a decrease in tumor
growth in mice receiving liposomal CDF in comparison
to the controls and liposome alone treatment (Figure
6A). The growth rate comparison suggests only a modest
additional inhibitory effect by the one-time cisplatin
treatment in the 5th week of liposomal CDF treatment.
The mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment
and the tumors were excised. A clear difference in tumor
size was observed in mice treated with liposomal CDF in
comparison to the untreated and liposome alone treated
mice (Figure 6B). To identify whether the tumor cell
growth inhibition was related to CD44 expression, the
expression level of CD44 was determined from the tumor
tissues. The qRT-PCR analysis normalized to the LDHA
internal house-keeping gene control expression showed a
statistically significant reduction in CD44 expression of
liposomal CDF treated tumors, confirming the effect of
CDF on CD44hi expressing cancer stem cells (Figure 6C).

Inhibition of in vivo UM-SCC-1 tumor cell growth
by intravenous liposomal CDF treatment
To determine the in vivo effect of liposomal CDF
in tumor growth inhibition, nude mice were injected with
UM-SCC-1R cells. One week after cell line injections,
5 mice each were intravenously injected with liposomal
CDF or control liposome 5 days per week for 4 weeks.
At the end of the fourth week the mice received an
intraperitoneal (i.p) 100 µL injection of 7.5 µg/mL
cisplatin in saline/mouse. Two mice without liposome
or liposomal CDF treatment were used as controls.
Tumor growth was measured every week after tumor
cell injections and the tumor volume was calculated as

liposomal curcumin shows a higher fraction of cell death compared to cisplatin and liposome alone treatment (44% vs 28% cell death

targets cisplatin resistant CD44hi cells. Cell numbers in brackets represent live cells after 48 hours. B.-C. Treatment of CCL-23R and
UM-SCC-1R cells with liposomal curcumin or liposomal CDF shows higher sensitivity of resistant cells to liposomal CDF treatment.
There is 20 and 4 fold increased sensitivity for liposomal CDF in CCL-23R and UM-SCC-1R cells respectively. D. Reduction in CD44
expression (qRT-PCR) of CCL-23R cells treated with liposomal CDF did not reach statistical significance (liposomal CDF vs liposome
alone is p = 0.3951) possibly due to a lower base level expression of CD44 in this cell line. However, statistically significant reduction
of CD44 expression is observed in UM-SCC-1R cells after treatment with liposomal CDF (liposomal CDF vs liposome alone is p =
0.04160). Statistical significance in UM-SCC-1R cells could be attributed to the higher base level expression of CD44. LDHA (lactate
dehydrogenase A) expression was used as the control house-keeping gene for the normalization.

DISCUSSION

or its analog CDF. Our studies also demonstrate that
liposomal CDF is more potent than curcumin both in vitro
and in vivo tumor cell growth inhibition and that CDF
is non-toxic. These results indicate that CDF could be
potentially used in human clinical trials.
There are close to 70 human clinical studies on
curcumin with 20 of them in human cancers including
colon, pancreatic, breast, prostate cancers, and multiple
myelomas [30-33]. In these trials, curcumin dosage has
varied from 0.2 to 8 grams daily and the duration of
treatment has varied from 10 days to 6 months. In phase
I and II trials of curcumin in patients with advanced

Cisplatin resistant head and neck cancer cell lines
was isolated by treating cells in culture with gradually
increasing concentrations of cisplatin, from 0.5 µg/mL
to 6.0 µg/mL. These cell lines were shown to exhibit
higher expression of CD44, cytokines and growth factors.
The FACS sorted CD44hi cells showed enhanced in vitro
growth and higher number of larger colonies in soft agar
indicating the isolation of cisplatin resistant cancer stem
cells. These cells were also growth inhibited by curcumin

Figure 6: UM-SCC-1R xenograft tumor cell growth inhibition by liposomal CDF. A. UM-SCC-1R cells isolated from 10µM

(3.0 µg/mL) cisplatin treatment were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice (2 × 106 cells/mouse). One week after tumor implantation
when tumor nodules were seen, liposome CDF (50 mg/kg, 1 mg for the 20 g mouse in a maximal volume of 100 µl in saline) or liposome
control were injected 5 days a week for 4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks mice received an i.p. injection of cisplatin (100 µl of 7.5 µg/mL in
saline solution). Statistically significant tumor cell growth inhibition is observed in liposomal CDF treated mice (p<0.05). B. Representative
tumors are shown indicating growth inhibition in liposomal CDF treated mice. C. Statistically significant decrease in CD44 expression is
seen in liposomal CDF injected animals in comparison to untreated and liposome alone injected animals (Liposomal CDF T3 vs Liposome
T2/Liposome T3 and Controls is p = 0.0065, Liposomal CDF T4 vs Liposome T2/Liposome T3 and Controls is p = 0.0013). Quantitative
RT-PCR data represent average of 4 values. D. Proposed mechanism of cisplatin and curcumin mediated growth inhibition of cancer stem
cells. Cisplatin (CDDP) induced senescence operates through p16 and p53 which could also result in the activation of transcription factors
and development of CSCs by the senescence associated proteins (SAPs). HPV infection could attract macrophages for the removal of
senescent cells. The HPV non expressing tumors lose their ability to attract macrophages leading to the development of chemo-radiation
resistant CSCs. Curcumin through the inhibition of transcription factors could play a role downstream of SAPs for the growth inhibition of
chemo-radiation resistant CSCs.

pancreatic cancer, oral doses of up to 8 grams daily
for 3 months were well-tolerated [30-33]. Outcomes
from all these clinical studies have been modest due to
poor absorption, inactivation by glucoronidation, and
excretion through urine and feces. Attempts to increase
bioavailability through modifications such as complexing
with soy phosphotidylcholine, reconstitution with non
curcuminoid components of turmeric, or adjuvant therapy
with piperine, an inhibitor of hepatic and intestinal
glucuronidation, have shown promising results for the
absorption and retention of curcumin in blood [32, 33].
Higher concentrations of proinflammatory and
proangiogenic cytokines are correlated with advanced
stage, metastatic disease, or large tumor burdens of
various cancers including head and neck cancers [3437]. One study identified elevated levels of the cytokines
interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and VEGF in
patients with HNSCC compared to patients with laryngeal
papilloma or age-matched controls [35]. Another study
detected increased concentrations of IL-8 in the saliva of
patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) compared with age- and sex-matched
control subjects [36]. Wong et al. have further shown that
there was enhanced expression of IL-8 in oral cancers
using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of 375 patient
salivary samples [37]. We have shown that chewing two
500 mg tablets of curcumin for 10-15 minutes resulted in
decreased expression of salivary cytokines and growth
factors [34]. Our results therefore indicated that even a
short period of treatment with curcumin had an effect on
the expression of cytokines and growth factors in head and
neck tumor cells. These studies revealed that increased
cytokine expression specifically that of IL-8 could be a
bio-marker of CSC development and curcumin could
target CSCs involved in the up-regulation of cytokines
and growth factors.
In the present investigation we have seen
overexpression of AKT signaling proteins in the cisplatin
resistant cell lines. Our previous studies have shown that
curcumin inhibits tumor cell growth through an AKT
independent pathway [22]. These two results may not be
contradictory, as curcumin inhibits NF-κB activation and
AKT activation is also related to the cytokine feedback
loop activated by NF-κB. Our data on both the in vitro
and in vivo inhibitory effect on CD44 clearly demonstrates
that curcumin targets CSCs and could reduce CD44hi CSC
accumulation during cisplatin treatment. This suggests that
curcumin supplements may increase efficacy of HNSCC
cisplatin treatment. We believe that a clinical evaluation
of CDF through oral treatment of head and neck cancer
patients for a longer period could provide evidence on the
utility of CDF in cancer treatments. It will also provide
an opportunity to understand the long-term effect of CDF
on growth factors and cytokines, and help determine the
toxicity of CDF in cancer patients.

(HPV) sequences, specifically those of oncogenic types,
HPV 16 and 18, has been reported in head and neck
cancer. These tumors, termed basaloid tumors, show
higher expression of p16 and are sensitive to cisplatinbased chemo-radiation treatment. Immunohistochemical
evaluation of p16 expression is used as a surrogate marker
for the presence of HPV. While it is possible that the
inactivation of Rb gene by the E7 protein of HPV could
result in re-expression of p16 through the E2F feedback
loop, we hypothesize that p16 mediated down-regulation
of NF-κB leads to decreased immune response at the
tumor site, and HPV is an opportunistic infection [7].
We therefore believe that the presence of HPV does not
alter the development of CSCs or development of chemoradiation resistance. Our hypothesis is supported by the
report that the development of cisplatin resistance in CSCs
was not altered by the expression of HPV E6/E7 genes
in the isolated CSCs [38]. Tang et al. conclude that HPV
status does not reflect the proportion of CSCs and does not
diminish resistance to cisplatin treatment [38]. In any case,
chemo-radiation treatment of head and neck cancer results
in the elimination of the bulk of the tumor expressing p16.
The p16 non-expressing cells acquire the properties of
cancer stem cells including chemo-radiation resistance.
There are reports indicating HPV mediated
immune response playing a surveillance role through
the removal of senescent cells by macrophages [39].
The senescence-associated proteins (SAPs) released
by the senescent cells have been suggested to activate
transcription factors leading to the development of
CSCs and chemoresistance [40, 41]. The removal of
senescent cells by the macrophages therefore could
improve chemosensitivity of head and neck cancer cells.
However, with the elimination of HPV/p16 positive cells
after chemotherapeutic treatment, there will be increased
activation of transcription factors by the SAPs followed
by an increase in CSC development. From the inhibitory
effect of curcumin on transcription factors shown by
various studies including our investigations, we propose
that a combination treatment of cisplatin-based chemoradiation treatment with curcumin or CDF could result in
the elimination of both the CSCs and non-CSCs, leading
to a better therapeutic response (Figure 6D). In such a
scenario, a lower cisplatin dose could be utilized reducing
toxic side effects to head and neck cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HNSCC cell lines and cell culture
The HNSCC cell lines CCL-23 and UM-SCC-1
representing laryngeal and oral cavity carcinomas
respectively were used. The CCL-23 cell line was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and
18512

Oncotarget

the UM-SCC-1 cell line was obtained from Dr. Thomas
E. Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). MTT
growth viability assays were carried out using the
established protocol. The CCL-23 cell line was grown
in Eagle minimum essential medium (Omega Scientific,
Tarzana, CA) with the addition of L-glutamine, 10% fetal
bovine serum, and nonessential amino acids. The UMSCC-1 cell line was grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle
medium containing high levels of glucose (4500 mg/L)
and L-glutamine (4 mmol/L) with the addition of 10%
fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids [7, 22,
27]. While CCL-23 cell line contains HPV 18 sequences,
UM-SCC-1 is a HPV negative cell line. Two hyper
variable regions (HVR1: 50-585 bp, HVR2: 16005-16503
bp) of mitochondrial genome of the revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence (rCRS) were used for the cell line
authentication [42]. The PCR products were sequenced at
the UCLA genome sequencing core facility on January 20,
2015, and the data showed six different single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in HVR1 and four different SNPs
in HVR2 in each of the two cell lines.

100 mmol/L stock solution. [28]. Liposomal CDF was
prepared the same way using the CDF provided by Dr.
Fazlul H. Sarkar (department of Pathology, Wayne State
University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI). The freeze
dried powder was used to make a 1.0 mM stock solution
in sterile 0.9% saline solution.

Treatment with cisplatin, liposomal curcumin, or
liposomal CDF
Cell lines were plated in 24-well plates, with 15,000
to 20,000 cells per well, and allowed to grow for 24 hours
to reach 60-70% confluence. The cells were then serum
starved for 12 to 24 hours to synchronize the cells to the
G0 phase of the cell cycle [22, 27]. Cells were treated with
cisplatin alone or in combination with liposome, liposomal
curcumin or liposomal CDF for 8 hours, with the addition
of cisplatin 3 hours after the treatment with liposome,
liposomal curcumin or liposomal CDF. Control liposomes
served as controls for the liposomal curcumin treatments.
Media was aspirated out at the end of 8 hour treatment
period and complete media was added.

Cisplatin treatment

Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis

The parental CCL-23 and, UM-SCC-1 cell lines
were plated in 12-well plates at 37°C and grown to
50% confluence. Cisplatin 600 µg/mL stock solution
in DMSO was used, and the dilutions were made in the
complete media used for the growth of cells. The cells
were incubated with cisplatin at 37°C for 5 hours for each
trial. Media was aspirated out at the end of the treatment
period and replaced with complete media. The cells were
incubated at 37°C for different time periods before harvest
[6, 22]. For the isolation of cisplatin resistant cell lines,
CCL-23 and UM-SCC-1 cell lines were treated with
increasing concentration of cisplatin, starting from 0.5 µg/
mL in the cell line media. While we could isolate CCL23R cells resistant to 6 µg/mL cisplatin, we could only
isolate UM-SCC-1 cells resistant to 3 µg/mL cisplatin. The
cells tended to dislodge from the culture plates at higher
concentrations.

Liposomal curcumin
preparation

and

liposomal

The CCL-23 and UM-SCC-1 cell lines were treated
with different combinations of cisplatin, liposome,
liposomal curcumin, and liposomal CDF, and stained with
CD44-FITC (Cat #555478, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
or Annexin-PE (Oncogene Research products, Boston,
MA). Intracellular P16 was stained using intracellular
staining kit protocol (Cat #415, BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) prior to staining with extracellular membrane
staining with anti-CD44-FITC or anti-Annexin-PE.
Stained cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson
FACScan analytic flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). Samples were protected from light
and maintained on ice and analyzed within an hour of
staining [6, 10, 11].

Annexin V assay

CDF
Characterization of apoptosis was carried out by
established method as described earlier [43]. Briefly,
cells were labeled with propidium iodide (PI) and
Annexin V-FITC staining using the apoptosis detection
kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), followed by flow
cytometric analysis at 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
5 × 105 cells were treated with cisplatin and subjected to
Annexin V staining. The cells were washed in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 100 µl of binding
buffer containing a FITC-conjugated anti-Annexin
V antibody, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow

A 9:1 ratio of lipids 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
was dissolved in tert-butanol at a concentration of 10 mg/
mL. Sterile water (1/20 volume) was added and 1 part
curcumin (purity 97%, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI) was added for a final lipid to curcumin ratio of 10:1.
The solution was sterile-filtered, frozen in dry ice and
acetone, and lyophilized overnight. Liposomal curcumin
was suspended in sterile 0.9% NaCl at 65°C to yield a

The values represent average of four readings of the Meso
Scale measurements.

FACS analysis and cell sorting

Quantitative RT-PCR of CD44

FACS analysis was done using the Becton Dickinson
FACSCalibur Analytic Flow Cytometer [10, 11]. Cell
sorting was performed using the Becton Dickinson FACS
Vantage SE Sorting Flow Cytometer at the UCLA-JCCC
Flow-cytometry core facility. CD44hi and CD44lo cells
were collected as the top and bottom 10% of CD44 stained
cells as described [11].

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and concentration was determined
by spectrophotometry. Reverse transcription of 1.0 μg total
RNA was completed using the iScript Advanced cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed on a
CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad)
using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) with 300
nM primer concentration and ~5 ng cDNA input. Raw
Ct values were calculated as an average of four technical
replicates. Relative gene expression values were calculated
after normalizing to the values of the housekeeping gene
lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and relative to control
samples. Primers used were: CD44 forward 5’- CCC AGA
TGG AGA AAG CTC TG -3’, CD44 reverse 5’- GTT
GTT TGC TGC ACA GAT GG -3’, LDHA forward 5’CTG CCA CCT CTG ACG CAC CA -3’, LDHA reverse
5’- AAA CAT CCA CCT GGC TCA AGG GG -3’.

Cell viability/MTT assay
Cell viability assay was performed according
to well established protocol [28]. Briefly, media was
aspirated from 24 well culture plate-wells and 1.0 mL
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) solution (1 mg/mL in complete medium;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added, incubated at
37°C for 4 hours, MTT solution was aspirated out of the
wells, air-dried for 5 minutes, dissolved in isopropanol,
and absorbance values were read in an ELISA microplate
reader at 570 nm.

Tumor growth inhibition studies in mice

Colony assay

Athymic Nude (NU/NU) mice, 5 weeks old female
were used for xenograft tumor studies, obtained from
Harlan, San Diego. Mice studies were conducted with the
protocols approved by local IACUC committee at West
Los Angeles VA Medical Center. Nude mice were injected
subcutaneously with UM-SCC-1R cells as described
above. Briefly, each mouse was injected with 2 × 106
cells suspended in 100 µL of sterile saline solution. Mice
were observed daily and one week after injection when
small tumor nodules were noticed, intravenous tail vein
injections of 1mg liposome or liposomal CDF in 100
µL of saline per mice were carried out five days a week
for 4 weeks. Tumor size was measured weekly using an
electronic caliper and the volume was calculated using the
formula V = 4/3π(W2L) where W is half of shorter axis
diameter and L is half of longer axis diameter as described
[29]. At the end of the 4th week, the mice also received
a one-time i.p. injection of cisplatin (100 µL of 7.5 µg/
mL in saline solution). Tumors were excised one week
later. Blood, liver, and kidney were collected for toxicity
studies.

Sorted CD44hi cells, CD44lo cells, and unsorted UMSCC-1 cells were plated at 1000 cells/well in triplicates in
six-well culture plates containing 0.35% top agar layered
over 0.5% base agar (DNA Grade) in culture media.
Colonies were counted at 3 weeks post plating and the
results are represented as the mean of three independent
experiments [11].

Meso Scale cytokine level and AKT pathway
protein measurement
Cytokine levels (bFGF, VEGF, MMP-1, MMP-9,
IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8) and AKT pathway
proteins (Akt, p-AKT, GSK-3b, p-GSK-3b, p7056K,
p-p7056K) in culture supernatant and solubilized
cell pellets were determined using the Human 9-Plex
Ultrasensitive Electrochemiluminescent MULTI-SPOT
Assay from Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD).
Cell pellet proteins were solubilized through the addition
of 100-200 μL of a detergent-containing extraction
buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). 25 μL of culture
supernatant or cell pellet protein were used for the
MULTI-SPOT assays which were performed according
to the manufacturer’s directions. Cytokines were detected
using the SECTOR Imager 6000 CCD camera (Meso
Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) [34]. The assays were
done in duplicates and were repeated at least once more.

laboratory did not reveal any systemic toxicity for
liposomes or liposomal CDF. Complete blood counts,
electrolytes, and the liver and kidney function tests
were within the reference range for the liposome or the
liposomal CDF treated mice. Histologically, kidney and
liver appeared normal in the treated animals, indicating
liposome and liposomal CDF to be non-toxic.
