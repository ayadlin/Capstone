institutional database. Age, histology, pathologic tumor size, modified Scarff-Bloomemboli (PVE), HR status, and the number of involved axillary lymph-node were considered as prognostic factors of recurrence.

RESULTS. Among 715 patients who met the inclusion criteria, a distant recurrence
occurred in 38 patients (5.3%) within the first 3 years of tamoxifen therapy. Significant prognostic factors of early recurrence were mSBR, axillary lymph node involvement, tumor necrosis, mitotic index, PVE, and pathologic tumor size. Grade 1 and/
or lymph node-negative tumors were excluded from the multivariate analysis (1 recurrence in 208 patients). In this model, mSBR grade 3 was the only significant predictive factor of early recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.72; P <.001).

CONCLUSIONS. In this study, a subset of patients was identified that was at low-risk
of early recurrence (mSBR grade 1 and/or negative lymph node status). Women in
that subset could be treated using sequential hormone therapy with tamoxifen and
AIs. In women with mSBR grade 3 or lymph node-positive tumors, an upfront treatment with AIs seemed to be the current optimal strategy. Cancer 2007;109:2197–

amoxifen-based endocrine therapy long has been the standard
adjuvant treatment for patients with hormone receptor (HR)positive breast cancer. In the adjuvant setting, the pivotal role of
tamoxifen has been established in successive overviews by the Early
Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group. A 5-year tamoxifen
treatment reduces the annual breast cancer recurrence and death
rates by 41% and 33%, respectively.1

The introduction in the 1990s of third-generation
aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (anastrozole, exemestane,
and letrozole) challenged the position of tamoxifen.
AIs demonstrated a similar or superior activity compared with megestrol acetate as second-line therapy
for advanced breast cancer after tamoxifen failure.2–5
The direct comparison of AIs with tamoxifen as firstline hormone therapy for advanced breast cancer
resulted in equivalent efficacy or a significant benefit
in favor of AIs.6–9 These results have led to the evaluation of AIs in the adjuvant setting according to 3
different strategies: an upfront comparison with tamoxifen for 5 years,10,11 a 5-year sequential treatment starting with 2 or 3 years of tamoxifen followed
by 2 or 3 years of AI,12,13 and an extended treatment
with AIs after 5 years of tamoxifen.14 Irrespective of
the treatment sequence, results from randomized phase
III trials displayed significant and constant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) with AI adjuvant
endocrine therapy.10–14 Widely disseminated treatment guidelines now incorporate AIs into the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.15
A side-by-side comparison of these trials must
be interpreted cautiously, because inclusion criteria
and definitions of primary endpoints differed. However, it appears that the 5-year sequential treatment
may provide a higher reduction in the risk of recurrence (27%–41%) than a 5-year treatment with AI
alone (17%–19%).10–13 The sequential strategy also
could reduce the risk of cumulative toxicities. However, according to Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in
Combination (ATAC) and Breast International Group
1–98 (BIG 1–98) trials, the sequential strategy of using
upfront tamoxifen resulted in a higher risk of early recurrence, whereas absolute differences of 1.7% and
2.5%, respectively, were observed in favor of AIs after 3
years of follow-up.10,11 To identify patients who were
eligible for sequential endocrine therapy, we performed
a monocentric, retrospective analysis to identify risk
factors of early recurrences among postmenopausal
women within the first 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Between 1986 and 2000, 4987 consecutive patients
with nonmetastatic, operable breast cancer were
entered onto our database. Postmenopausal, HRpositive (ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor
[PgR]-positive) women with operable breast cancer
who underwent surgery in our institution (Institut
Bergonie, Bordeaux, France) without receiving previ-

ous neoadjuvant treatments were eligible for the
analysis. These patients had to receive adjuvant tamoxifen for at least 3 years in the absence of disease
recurrence. Exclusion criteria included a previous history of breast carcinoma, concurrent contralateral
breast cancer, pathologic data missing, premenopausal status, negative or undetermined HR status,
and no tamoxifen therapy. Patients who were followed for <3 years and did not develop distant recurrences were excluded from the analysis. Patients who
had received chemoendocrine therapy were excluded
because of the small number of patients involved
(n ¼ 27). Follow-up was performed according to the
European Good Clinical Practice requirements and
consisted of regular physical examinations, an annual
x-ray mammogram, and additional assessments in
case of suspected metastases.

Definition of Prognostic Factors
Age, histology, pathologic tumor size, histoprognostic
tumor grade, mitotic index, tumor necrosis, peritumoral vascular emboli (PVE), ER/PR status, and the
number of involved axillary lymph nodes were considered as possible prognostic factors of recurrence.
Clinical and pathologic characteristics were analyzed
according to the hospital-recorded file at the time of
treatment initiation. Pathologic tumor size was measured on fresh surgical specimens. A modified version
of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (mSBR) grading system was used. Mitotic index was calculated as a
function of the number of observed mitoses in 10
consecutive high-power fields (3400): A score of 1
was associated with <5 mitoses, a score 2 indicated
from 5 to 15 mitoses, and a score 3 indicated >15
mitoses. Tumor necrosis was coded according to the
presence or absence of necrosis. PVE were defined as
the presence of neoplastic emboli within unequivocal
vascular lymphatic or capillary lumina in areas adjacent to the breast tumor. The vascular structures
involved (lymphatic vessels or veins) were not specified.16 ER status and PgR status were determined by
a radioligand assay with cut-off values of 10 fmol/mg
and 15 fmol/mg proteins, respectively. There was a
mean number of 15 lymph nodes per axillary dissection. Each lymph node was cut into 2-mm-thick
slices, and the entire lymph node was submitted for
pathologic analysis.17
Immunohistochemistry
An additional exploratory immunohistochemical analysis was performed on a tissue microarray (TMA) to
control for HR status and to detect the expression of
biologic factors that potentially implicated tamoxifen
resistance. Hollande-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor

Tamoxifen and Early Metastases/Debled et al.

blocks were obtained from the primary breast tumors
of women who presented with distant recurrences
during the first 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. Clearly
defined tumor areas were selected and, 4 tissue cores,
which measured 0.6 mm in greatest dimension, were
obtained from each donor block and mounted onto a
recipient block using a TMA instrument according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Alphelys, France).
Four-micrometer TMA sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated, and treated in a pressure cooker for 20
minutes in a 0.01-M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, before
processing in an automatic immunohistochemistry
staining machine according to standard procedures
(TechMate 500; DakoCytomation, Trappes, France).
Tissue sections were incubated for 60 minutes with
HER2 antibody (DA485; DakoCytomation; 1/2000
dilution), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
2 (VEGF-R2) antibody (sc-6251; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif; 1/1000 dilution),18 ER antibody (1D5; DakoCytomation; 1/100 dilution), and PgR
antibody (PgR636; DakoCytomation; 1/100 dilution).
Staining for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
was performed using the EGFR PharmDx kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (DakoCytomation).
HER2 and EGFR expression levels were evaluated
semiquantitatively according to a standard protocol
(Herceptest; DakoCytomation). ER and PgR expression levels were evaluated semiquantitatively with
cut-off values of 10% positive invasive tumor cells.
VEGF-R2 expression was evaluated as described previously.18 Briefly, the intensity of VEGF-R2 cytoplasmic staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using a
classification from 0 to 31 to indicate lack of staining
(0), low staining intensity (11), intermediate staining
intensity (21), and high staining intensity (31).

Statistical Analysis
All inclusion and exclusion criteria and selected
prognostic factors were defined prospectively before
the analysis began. Endpoints were planned according to usual published analyses. The events analyzed
consisted of supraclavicular or distant recurrences of
breast cancer that occurred within 3 years after the
initiation of adjuvant tamoxifen. All events reported
beyond that period were censored. Event-free survival (EFS) rates were calculated by using the
Kaplan-Meier method. The significance of each prognostic factor was computed using a log-rank test,
and the test was considered statistically significant
when the P value was .05. A multivariate analysis
(Cox proportional-hazards model) was adjusted for
predefined prognostic factors. Prognostic factors that
were entered onto the multivariate model had to
reach the statistical significance level of .05 in the

2199

univariate analysis. This analysis was conducted
according to the Reporting Recommendations for
Tumor Marker guidelines for prognostic studies reported by the Statistics Subcommittee of the National
Cancer Institute-European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer Working Group on Cancer
Diagnostics.19

RESULTS
Patient and Treatment Characteristics
According to the criteria for inclusion and exclusion,
715 patients were selected from the 4987 women who
were entered into our database. The reasons for
exclusion from the analysis included a history of breast
carcinoma or concurrent contralateral breast cancer
(n ¼ 499 women), pathologic data missing (n ¼ 370
women), premenopausal status (n ¼ 1257 women),
negative or undetermined HR status (n ¼ 1040
women), no tamoxifen treatment (n ¼ 1030 women),
adjuvant chemotherapy (n ¼ 27 women), and death
without recurrence or <3 years of follow-up (n ¼ 49
women). The main clinical and pathologic characteristics of assessable patients are summarized in Table
1. Among the selected patients, 154 patients (21.5%)
did not receive radiation therapy.
Recurrence and Analysis of Prognostic Factors
During the first 3 years of tamoxifen therapy, 38
patients developed a distant recurrence (5.3%). The
3-year EFS rate was 94.7%. The distribution of events
over the time is shown in Table 2.
In the univariate analysis, significant prognostic
factors of early recurrence were mSBR grade, axillary
lymph node involvement, tumor necrosis, mitotic
index, PVE, and pathologic tumor size (Table 3).
Although the likelihood was not significant, patients
with negative PgR status were more likely to develop
a recurrence (7.2% vs 4.1%; P ¼ .068). Neither age
nor histology was associated significantly with early
recurrences. Because there was only 1 recurrence
among the 155 patients who had negative lymph
node status and only 1 recurrence among the 169
patients who had mSBR grade 1 tumors, these subsets
of patients were not suitable for the Cox regression
model. The multivariate analysis included patients
who presented with lymph node-positive and mSBR
grade 2 or 3 ductal carcinomas; thus, mSBR grade, tumor necrosis, mitotic index, PVE, and pathologic tumor size were selected as prognostic factors. In this
model, mSBR grade 3 was the only significant predictive factor of early recurrence during the first 3 years of
tamoxifen therapy (hazard ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence
interval, 1.79–7.73; P < .001). Approximately 16% of

patients (7.9%) with recurrent disease were identified
as HR-negative (for ER and PgR) using an immunohistochemical technique (the 1D5 antibody for ER

(13.2%) overexpressed HER2 (31), and 1 additional
patient expressed HER2 with 21 positivity. The majority of patients (89.4%) with recurrent disease did
not express EGFR, whereas no correlation was
demonstrated for the expression of VEGF-R2.

of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Two groups of
patients were identified clearly, as expected. First,
8.2% of patients who had lymph node-positive,
mSBR grade 2 or 3 tumors developed an early systemic recurrence, and this rate reached 15.6% among
patients who had lymph node-positive, grade 3
tumors. These results must be interpreted with caution, because no patients had received adjuvant
chemotherapy according to the standard treatment
procedures during the time frame of recruitment.
Meanwhile, several randomized trials have demonstrated a significant improvement in DFS with
anthracycline-based, chemoendocrine therapy compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal

2201

women with HR-positive breast cancer.20–23 Conversely, we also identified a large subset of patients
(40%) with a very low risk of early recurrence, ie,
patients with lymph node-negative and/or mSBR
grade 1 tumors. However, the absence of early recurrence in lymph node-negative patients does not preclude the risk of later distant recurrence, which
reaches a 10-year incidence of 30% according to previously published data.24,25 Indeed, it has been
demonstrated that several factors have a nonproportional effect on hazards.26–28 The ER level is a major
concern, because positive ER status has been associated with a protective effect on recurrences within
the first 3 years, but that association switches to a
negative effect on disease outcome after 3 years.27
Consequently, the commonly used Cox proportionalhazards regression may not be the best statistical
method for the analysis of prognostic factors in
patients with breast carcinoma. Considering only
events that occur over a restricted period is one way
to limit the impact of a violation of proportional
hazards rules.27
The analysis of early recurrence in a cohort of
homogeneously tamoxifen-treated patients also has
provided information regarding which factors are
were predictive of resistance to treatment. Negative
PgR status has been linked to a decreased benefit of
tamoxifen in the metastatic setting29 and in the adjuvant setting, in which a greater benefit from anastrozole versus tamoxifen was reported in ER-positive/
PgR-negative subgroups compared with ER-positive/
PgR-positive subgroups.30 Conversely, no interaction
between treatment effect and PgR expression was
reported by the BIG 1–98 trial in a comparison of tamoxifen versus letrozole.11 Because the overexpression of HER2 and EGFR has been associated with a
low response to tamoxifen in both metastatic and
neoadjuvant settings,31–35 the indication for adjuvant
tamoxifen also is controversial in patients who present with those features. In our analysis, we did not
notice a significantly increased incidence of negative
PgR status in patients who developed an early distant
recurrence. Furthermore, exploratory immunohistochemical analyses performed on primary tumors that
recurred during tamoxifen treatment did not reveal
any unusual expression of EGFR, HER2, or VEGF-R2
that could have suggested a role in tamoxifen resistance.18 However, we did not compare the incidence
of marker expression between tumors from patients
who recurred and patients who did not recur, making
it difficult to draw any conclusions. Genetic variation
in tamoxifen-metabolizing enzymes may be another
important factor to consider. Tamoxifen is converted
by the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) in

antiestrogenic metabolites, which are more potent
than tamoxifen itself. Thereby, women with a low activity of CYP2D6 may develop a substantial decrease
in tamoxifen activity.36 Recently, a study of 256 patients
with breast cancer who had received adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years indicated that patients who had
2 variants of CYP2D6 alleles (7% of patients) had a
higher risk of recurrence than patients who had 1 or
2 normal alleles.37 An immediate, broad peak in the
recurrence-free survival hazard rate was observed for
patients with decreased metabolism. In contrast, the
hazard rate for patients with high metabolism was
reduced and did not peak until almost the fourth
year.37
AI therapy is recommended widely for postmenopausal women with HR-positive breast cancer,
although the optimal strategy remains under discussion. Hopefully, mature results from the BIG 1–98
and Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational
(TEAM) trials will provide a conclusive answer.
Meanwhile, the choice of a therapeutic strategy is
required. To date, the only tools at our disposal are 2
mathematic modeling estimates.38–40 These models
have reported conflicting results, probably because
of methodological differences in the definition of
endpoints and a possible carryover effect of AI therapy beyond 5 years of treatment. The surface model
favored an upfront treatment with AI,38 whereas the sequential strategy appeared to be preferable for patients
with ER-positive/PgR-positive tumors according to the
Markov model.39,40 These estimations must be interpreted carefully interpreted because of the limitations
of such modeling.
The safety profile of endocrine therapy also
should be considered. With regard to upfront treatments, the results from 2 substudies of the TEAM
and ATAC trials did not indicate any major differ-

ences in terms of quality of life between AI and tamoxifen.41,42 Nevertheless, women who received AI
reported fewer cold sweats and vaginal discharge but
presented with more vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, and loss of sexual interest compared with
women who received tamoxifen. Muscular and joint
pains also were more frequent with AI. For long-term
toxicity, a potential advantage of sequential strategy
may be the decrease in cumulative toxicities, such as
thromboembolic diseases and endometrial carcinoma related to tamoxifen or cardiovascular risk
with AI. It is a major concern that the risk of osteoporosis and clinical fractures were increased with the
use of AIs, regardless of treatment strategies. The
onset of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen, which
increases bone mineral density, may be of interest in
women who have preexisting osteoporosis, and the
results of ongoing trials are awaited. In addition, it
has been demonstrated that vitamin D is a potent
stimulator of CYP19 (P450 aromatase gene) transcription, although prophylaxis with vitamin D in AItreated patients requires further assessment before it
can be recommended.43 The current lack of knowledge about the potential long-term side effects of
AIs, including their impact on cognitive function,44
also should be considered. Finally, the results from 2
recent analyses indicted that 3 years of AI subsequent to 2 years of tamoxifen were associated with
the lowest cost/quality-adjusted life years, regardless
of the type of costs, ie, costs related to the risk of
fractures or recurrences.45,46
Results have shown that the upfront strategy provided a reduction of approximately 2% in metastatic
recurrences within the first 3 years of treatment compared with tamoxifen.10,11 Therefore, the identification of patients who have a high risk of distant
recurrence is crucial in the choice between upfront

Tamoxifen and Early Metastases/Debled et al.

and sequential treatments. An important finding of
our analysis is the identification of patient subsets
that present with low risk or high risk of early recurrence during tamoxifen therapy. Despite differences
in methodology and inclusion criteria, 3 recent retrospective analyses that addressed this topic converged
on similar conclusions: The risk of early recurrence
during tamoxifen or toremifen therapy was correlated
highly with axillary lymph node involvement.47–49 A
high histoprognostic grade was associated significantly with an increased risk of early recurrence,
regardless of studies, and remained significant in 2
studies according to multivariate analyses.48 Along
with tumor volume and proliferation markers, HR
status should be considered as an independent
marker of early recurrence (Table 6).47,48
In conclusion, the optimal strategy for hormonal
adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women currently is discussed, and results from the 4-arm BIG
1–98 and TEAM studies are warranted. Waiting for
clearer answers, the choice between upfront and
sequential strategies with AIs should be based on
different parameters, including menopausal status,
knowing the risk of ovarian function recovery, predictive factors of early recurrence, comorbidities, safety
profile, cumulative toxicities, and cost. Our findings,
in association with the results from 3 other analyses,
indicated clearly that the most important criteria to
be considered for the risk of early recurrence during
tamoxifen treatment were lymph node status and
histoprognostic tumor grade. The analysis of genetic
variations in tamoxifen-metabolizing enzymes may
be an important concern in the prediction of tamoxifen sensitivity.
