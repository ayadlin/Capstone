BACKGROUND. Garlic-derived organosulfur compounds such as diallyl sulfide
(DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) provide significant
protection against carcinogenesis.

METHODS. Dose-dependent cytotoxic effects of the garlic compounds (DAS,
Department of Neurosciences, Medical University
of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.

DADS, and DATS) were tested in human glioblastoma T98G and U87MG cells.
Wright staining and ApopTag assay confirmed induction of apoptosis. Measurements showed that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase
in intracellular free [Ca21] promoted apoptosis. Western blot analysis indicated
that increased expression and activities of the stress kinases and cysteine proteases caused apoptosis. Use of JC-1 showed changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) for mediation of apoptosis. Use of the specific inhibitors
monitored the activation of different kinases and proteases in apoptosis.

RESULTS. Treatment of glioblastoma cells with garlic compounds triggered production of ROS that induced apoptosis with the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK
and activation of the redox-sensitive JNK1 pathway. Pretreatment of cells with
ascorbic acid attenuated ROS production, p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and JNK1
activation. Pretreatment with JNK1 inhibitor I also significantly reduced cell
death. Increases in intracellular free [Ca21], expression of calreticulin, and activation of caspase-4 indicated involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in
apoptosis. Other events in apoptosis included overexpression of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and some BIRC proteins, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c
and Smac into the cytosol, and activation of calpain, caspase-9, and caspase-3.

CONCLUSIONS. Garlic compounds induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells due
to production of ROS, increase in ER stress, decrease in Dwm, and activation
of stress kinases and cysteine proteases. Cancer 2007;110:1083–94.  2007

lioblastoma is the most malignant type among all primary brain
tumors.1 The median survival, even with aggressive multimodality treatments, does not exceed 1 year. Thus, new therapeutic strategies need to be explored. Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is a widely
consumed herb in foodstuffs and medicines.2 Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory studies have shown that crushed or processed

diverse biologic activities including antitumorigenesis
effects.3 Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of anticancer action of garlic compounds may
involve modulation of signal transduction pathways.4
Induction of apoptosis by garlic products can be
dependent on production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS).5 Some inducers of apoptosis work via production of ROS that can activate the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.6 The MAPK kinase
kinases (MAPKKKs) phosphorylate and activate
downstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) that ultimately
activate the MAPK pathway. Many extracellular stimuli are transduced to the cells through these intracellular signaling cascades. Activation of p38 MAPK
is generally associated with induction of apoptosis,
whereas activation of p42/44 MAPK exerts cytoprotective effects.7,8 DADS induces apoptosis in leukemia HL-60 cells and breast cancer MDA-MB-231
cells with activation of caspase-3,6,9 and suppresses
colon tumor cell proliferation and cell cycle
arrest.10,11 The antitumor effects of DADS may be
related to its ability to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.12 However, the role of
the p38 MAPK pathway in inducing apoptosis in glioblastoma cells after exposure to garlic compounds is
unclear.
The current study was conducted to understand
the mechanism of induction of apoptosis by garlic
compounds in human glioblastoma T98G and
U87MG cells. We revealed activation of stress kinases, calpain, and caspases for apoptosis in human
glioblastoma cells treated with DAS, DADS, and
DATS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 378C in a fully humidified incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide. Before
treatments, cells were starved in RPMI-1640 medium
with 0.5% FBS for 24 hours. Stock solutions of DAS
and DADS (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo)
and DATS (LKT Laboratories, St. Paul, Minn) were
prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) just before
the experiments. An equal amount of DMSO (0.01%)
was added to untreated control cells. Dose-response
studies were conducted to determine that treatment
of cells with 100 lM DAS, 100 lM DADS, and 25 lM
DATS for 24 hours could induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. After treatments, cells were used for
the determination of amounts of apoptosis and specific proteins involved in this process.

Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion Test
Residual cell viability in the attached and detached
cell populations was estimated by Trypan blue dye
exclusion test.12 At least 600 cells were counted in 4
different fields for determination of residual cell viability.

Wright Staining and ApopTag Assay
The cells from each treatment were sedimented onto
the microscopic slide and fixed in methanol before
examination of apoptosis by Wright staining12 and
ApopTag assay.12 Wright staining detected characteristic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation, cell-volume shrinkage, and membrane-bound
apoptotic bodies. ApopTag assay kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) was used for biochemical detection of
DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. The nuclei
containing DNA fragments were stained dark brown
with ApopTag assay and were not counterstained
with methyl green that, however, stained normal
nuclei pale to medium green. After ApopTag assay,
cells were counted to determine percentage of
apoptosis.

Determination of ROS Production
The fluorescence probe 20 ,70 -dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) was used for assessment of ROS
production13 in T98G and U87MG cells. Briefly, cells
were seeded (1 3 105 cells/well) in 6-well culture
plates and the next day cells were washed twice with
Hank balanced salt solution (GIBCO-BRL, Grand
Island, NY) and loaded with 500 ll Hank balanced
salt solution containing 5 lM DCF-DA and different
concentrations of DAS, DADS, and DATS. Cells were
then incubated at 378C for different timepoints (0–
1440 minutes) and the intracellular fluorescence intensity was measured at 530 nanometers (nm) after
excitation at 480 nm in Spectramax Gemini XPS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif). The increase in
fluorescence intensity was used to assess the net production of intracellular ROS.

Fura-2 Assay
The fluorescence Ca21 indicator fura-2/AM was
used, as we described previously,12 for determination
of intracellular free [Ca21] in T98G and U87MG cells.
The value of Kd, a cell-specific constant, was determined experimentally to be 0.387 lM for the T98G
cells and 0.476 lM for the U87MG cells, using standards of the Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit with Magnesium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore).

Analysis of mRNA Expression
Extraction of total RNA, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and agarose gel
electrophoresis were performed as we described previously.14 All primers (Table 1) for the RT-PCR experiments were designed using Oligo software (National
Biosciences, Plymouth, Minn). The level of b-actin
gene expression served as an internal control.
Antibodies
Monoclonal antibody against b-actin (Sigma Chemical Company) was used to standardize cytosolic protein loading on the SDS-PAGE. Anti-cytochrome c
oxidase subunit IV (COX4) antibody (Molecular
Probes) was used to standardize the mitochondrial
protein loading. The inner mitochondrial membrane
protein COX4 remains in the mitochondria regardless
of activation of apoptosis.15 Antibodies against cytochrome c (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif), a-spectrin
(Affiniti, Exeter, UK), phospho-p38 MAPK (Promega,
Madison, Wis), and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (New
England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass) were also used. All
other primary immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz,
Calif). We used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat antimouse IgG secondary antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, Ohio) for detecting all primary IgG
antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (ICN Biomedicals) for detecting calpain and a-spectrin.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as we described
previously.12 The autoradiograms were scanned using
Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Seattle, Wash)
and the optical density (OD) of each band was determined using Quantity One software (BioRad, Hercules, Calif).

Measurement of Dwm
For measurement of Dwm, cells were treated with
DAS, DADS, or DATS in medium containing 5 lg/mL
JC-1 from 0 to 24 hours.13 After JC-1 staining, the
cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended. After excitation at 488
nm, the fluorescence emission of JC-1 was measured
in a fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, Calif) at wavelengths corresponding to its
monomer (530 nm) and J aggregate (590 nm) forms.
Any decrease in the JC-1 monomer (530 nm): J aggregate (590 nm) ratio indicates a drop in Dwm in the
cells.
Analyses of Cytosolic, Mitochondrial,
and Nuclear Proteins
Preparations of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear
fractions were performed by standard procedures.12
Cytochrome c in the supernatant fluids and pellets
and also caspase-3 activated DNase (CAD) in nuclear
fractions were analyzed by Western blotting.
Colorimetric Assays for Measuring Caspase-9 and
Caspase-3 Activities
Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities in the cells were
measured based on the release of p-nitroanilide (pNA) from LEHD-p-NA and DEVD-p-NA, respectively,
using the commercially available colorimetric assay
kits (Sigma Chemical Company). Concentration of
the p-NA released from the substrate was calculated
from the absorbance at 405 nm.
Treatment With Stress Kinase Inhibitors
The cell-permeable JNK inhibitor I and SB203580
(Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif) were used at 10 lM for
specific inhibition of phosphorylation of JNK1 and
p38 MAPK, respectively. Lower concentrations did
not show significant inhibition of phosphorylation
and higher concentrations were toxic. Inhibitor was
added 1 hour before the addition of a garlic compound and maintained throughout the experiment.
Treatment With Protease Inhibitors
Cells were pretreated (1 hour) with either 10 lM calpeptin (Calbiochem), or 10 lM caspase-9 inhibitor I
(Calbiochem), or 10 lM caspase-3 inhibitor IV (Calbiochem) at 378C for prevention of cell death due to
subsequent treatment with a garlic compound. Control cultures were pretreated (1 hour) with an equivalent amount of DMSO (0.01%) or left untreated.
The residual viable cells did not uptake Trypan blue
dye and the percentage of viability was calculated.

sulfide (DAS) and diallyl disulfide (DADS).

Measurement of Glutathione S-Transferase Activity
We measured total glutathione S-transferase (GST)
activity in cell homogenates by using the standard
GST assay kit (Sigma Chemical) that contained 1chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) for covering the
total activity of the broadest range of GST isozymes.
On conjugation of the thiol group of glutathione to
the substrate CDNB, there is an increase in the absorbance at 340 nm.
Statistical Analysis
Results obtained from different treatments were analyzed using StatView software (Abacus Concepts,
Berkeley, Calif). Data were expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD) of separate experiments (n  3)
and compared by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by the Fisher post hoc test. Significant differences from control values are indicated by P < .05
(*, #, or y) and P < .001 (**, ##, or yy).

RESULTS
Garlic Compounds Decreased Cell Viability and
Increased Apoptotic Death
Garlic compounds (DAS and DADS) dose-dependently decreased residual cell viability in both T98G
and U87MG cells (Fig. 1). Apoptotic death (Fig. 2)
was determined using Wright staining (Fig. 2A) and
ApopTag assay (Fig. 2B). We found that treatment of
the cells with 100 lM DAS or 100 lM DADS was optimum to induce apoptosis. Cells from the ApopTag
assay were counted for determination of amounts of
apoptosis. Compared with control (CTL) cells, treat-

ment with DAS and DADS increased the percentage
of apoptosis (Fig. 2C). Notably, DADS was more
effective than DAS for induction of apoptosis.

DAS and DADS Triggered ROS Production
We measured ROS production in T98G and U87MG
cells after exposure to DAS and DADS for different
times (Fig. 3). Time-dependently, DAS and DADS
increased the ROS production in T98G cells (Fig. 3A)
as well as in U87MG cells (Fig. 3B) and ROS production could be completely blocked by pretreatment of
cells with ascorbic acid (Asc). These results indicated
that DAS and DADS induced apoptosis by a mechanism that required increase in intracellular ROS
levels in T98G and U87MG cells.
ROS Induced p38 MAPK Phosphorylation
Leading to Apoptosis
Because ROS production could activate the stress
kinase pathway, we examined phosphorylation of
stress kinases (Fig. 4). Treatment of glioblastoma cells
with DAS and DADS induced an increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) selectively
because no increase in phosphorylation of p42
MAPK or p44 MAPK occurred (Fig. 4A). Compared
with CTL cells, DAS and DADS caused a significant
increase in p-p38 MAPK (Fig. 4B). Asc was used as
an antioxidant to examine its effect on the level of
expression of p-p38 MAPK (Fig. 4C). Asc completely
blocked an increase in expression of p-p38 MAPK
(Fig. 4D), indicating the involvement of ROS in inducing p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The levels of
expression of p38 MAPK remained almost the same

in all treatments. To determine whether p38 MAPK
phosphorylation was required for induction of apoptosis, we tested the effect of SB203580 that could
specifically inhibit p38 MAPK phosphorylation.16 Pretreatment of the cells with 5 lM SB203580 almost
completely blocked apoptosis in glioblastoma cells
(data not shown). Together, these results suggested
that ROS production induced selective phosphorylation of p38 MAPK for apoptosis in glioblastoma cells
after exposure to DAS and DADS.

DAS and DADS Activated JNK1 Pathway for Cell Death
The active form of JNK1 is phosphorylated JNK1 (pJNK1) that regulates the transcription of several
genes for induction of cell death. We performed Western blot analysis to examine levels of expression of

p-JNK1 (Fig. 5). Increased expression of p-JNK1
occurred in glioblastoma cells after treatments with
DAS and DADS (Fig. 5A). The involvement of activated JNK1 pathway in cell death was confirmed
using the cell-permeable JNK inhibitor I (Fig. 5B).
Pretreatment of the cells with 10 lM JNK inhibitor I
provided protection from cell death (Fig. 5B), indicating activation of the JNK1 pathway in cell death.

DAS and DADS Increased Intracellular Free [Ca21]
An abrupt increase in intracellular free [Ca21] after
treatment with anticancer agents could activate
Ca21-dependent proteases for induction of apoptosis.
We used the fura-2 assay to determine the intracellular free [Ca21] in T98G and U87MG cells (Fig. 6).
Compared with CTL cells, treatment with DAS or

DADS caused a significant increase in intracellular
free [Ca21] in T98G and U87MG cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that garlic compounds caused Ca21 influx
leading to apoptosis.

Apoptosis With an Increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 Ratio
A commitment of cells to apoptosis was measured
by examining any increase in the Bax expression
and/or decrease in Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 7). Our RT-

PCR experiments demonstrated that garlic compounds increased mRNA expression of the bax gene
and slightly decreased mRNA expression of the bcl-2
gene (Fig. 7A). Also, Western blot analysis with a
monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing both
21-kilodalton (kD) Baxa and 24-kD Baxb bands
showed an increase in Bax levels, whereas another
antibody detected almost no change in 26-kD Bcl-2
levels after exposure to garlic compounds (Fig. 7B).
Densitometric analysis of the Western blots confirmed that, compared with CTL cells, garlic compounds significantly increased the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio
(data not shown), making a commitment of the glioblastoma cells to apoptosis.

Loss of Dwm and Mitochondrial Release of Cytochrome
c for Activation of Caspase-9
We examined mitochondrial events leading to activation of caspase-9 for cell death (Fig. 8). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) is readily
measured using the JC-1 staining of mitochondria in
the cells.13 As expected, a high JC-1 ratio (590 nm:
530 nm), indicating normal Dwm in control T98G
(Fig. 8A) and U87MG cells (Fig. 8B). Treatments with
DAS and DADS dropped slowly the mean red and
green fluorescence ratio of the mitochondria in a
biphasic way, indicating loss of the Dwm for cell
death. The loss of Dwm was associated with the disappearance of 15-kD cytochrome c from the mitochondrial fraction and its subsequent appearance in
the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 8C). We monitored expression of COX4 as an internal control in mitochondrial
fraction. The mitochondrial release of cytochrome c
into the cytosol aided formation of the active 37-kD

caspase-9 fragment in T98G and U87MG cells after
treatment with DAS and DADS (Fig. 8C). Further, colorimetric assay demonstrated a significant increase
in caspase-9 activity in both glioblastoma cells after
treatments with garlic compounds (Fig. 8D). Pretreatment of cells with caspase-9 inhibitor I prevented
cell death (Fig. 8E), suggesting the involvement of
caspase-9 in cell death. Together, these results suggested that loss of Dwm, mitochondrial release of
cytochrome c, and subsequent activation of caspase9 played key roles in cell death.

Mitochondrial Release of Smac Into the Cytosol for
Suppression of BIRC
In response to apoptotic stimuli, Smac is released
from mitochondria into the cytosol to block the inhibitory function of inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins
(IAPs) and thereby promote caspase-9 activation.17
Because all IAPs bear 1 or more characteristic zincfinger motif termed baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR), the
whole family of these proteins is now more precisely
known as BIR-containing (or BIRC) proteins rather
than IAPs. We examined the levels of Smac and BIRC
proteins in apoptosis of T98G and U87MG cells after
treatments with DAS and DADS (Fig. 9). Both DAS
and DADS induced mitochondrial release of Smac
into the cytosol (Fig. 9A) and thereby significantly
decreased the level of mitochondrial Smac (Fig. 9B).
The protein levels of BIRC-2, -3, -4, and -5 were
examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 9C). The mitochondrial release of Smac into the cytosol correlated well with the decrease in BIRC-2, -3, -4, and -5
levels. These results indicated that DAS and DADS
induced apoptosis in T98G and U87MG cells with
mitochondrial release of Smac into the cytosol and
suppression of BIRC proteins.
Association of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress With
Activation of Caspase-4, Calpain, and Caspase-3
We monitored endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in
the overexpression of calreticulin (an ER luminal protein)18 and activation of caspase-4 (localized in ER
and cleaved to the active form in response to ER
stress)19 and calpain in glioblastoma cells after exposure to garlic compounds (Fig. 10). An increase in
expression in calreticulin was associated with activation of caspase-4 in glioblastoma cells (Fig. 10A).
Degradation of 270-kD a-spectrin to 145-kD spectrin
breakdown product (SBDP) and 120-kD SBDP has
been attributed to proteolytic activities of calpain
and caspase-3, respectively.12 Treatment of cells with
DAS and DADS caused increases in 145-kD SBDP
and 120-kD SBDP, indicating increases in activities of
calpain and caspase-3, respectively (Fig. 10A). In-

creased calpain activity was also associated with Bid
cleavage to tBid (Fig. 10A). Caspase-3 activation was
further confirmed in the generation of active 20-kD
caspase-3 fragment (Fig. 10A). Garlic compounds significantly increased caspase-3 activity, as determined
by a colorimetric assay (Fig. 10B). Pretreatment of

DAS and DADS Decreased Calpastatin Expression at
mRNA and Protein Levels
The proteolytic activity of calpain is controlled by
calpastatin (the endogenous calpain inhibitor) that,

however, may be degraded by calpain and caspases
during apoptosis.20 We examined the levels of calpastatin in both T98G and U87MG cells after treatments
with DAS and DADS (Fig. 11). Our RT-PCR results
demonstrated a substantial reduction in calpastatin
at the mRNA level (Fig. 11A). In addition, Western
blot analysis demonstrated a similar decrease in calpastatin at the protein level (Fig. 11B). A decreased
level of calpastatin might not be sufficient to effi-

ciently inhibit the increased calpain activity in T98G
and U87MG cells after treatment with DAS and
DADS.

DAS and DADS Induced CAD Activation
In apoptosis, activation of caspase-3 cleaves the inhibitor of caspase-3-activated DNase (ICAD) to
release CAD.12 Free CAD is active and can enter the
nucleus to degrade chromosomal DNA. We performed Western blot analysis for estimation of CAD
in nuclear fraction (Fig. 12). One set of gel was
stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure equal
amounts of nuclear protein loading in all lanes. The
levels of nuclear CAD were increased in T98G and
U87MG cells after treatment with DAS and DADS.
Low Dose of DATS Induced Cell Death
in Glioblastoma Cells
In addition to DAS and DADS, we examined the efficacy of DATS (another garlic compound) for induction of apoptosis in glioblastoma cells (Fig. 13). We
found that DATS induced cell death in a dosedependent manner in T98G (Fig. 13A) and U87MG
(Fig. 13B) cells. Notably, DATS was more potent than
DAS and DADS for induction of cell death. The
mechanism of DATS-mediated cell death in T98G
(Fig. 13C) and U87MG (Fig. 13D) cells was associated
with ROS production, which was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with Asc. We also observed that
treatment of glioblastoma cells with a low dose of
DATS caused loss of Dwm (Fig. 13E) and increased activities of caspase-9 (Fig. 13F) and caspase-3 (Fig. 13G),
indicating involvement of mitochondria in mediation
of cell death. Because up regulation of GST activity

monitor equal amounts of loading of nuclear protein in each lane.

in the cells could be a potential mechanism of resistance to alkylating agents such as garlic compounds,
we measured the levels of GST activity in both T98G
and U87MG cells after exposure to DAS, DADS, and
DATS (Fig. 13H). Our data showed nonsignificant
increases in GST activity in glioblastoma cells
exposed to all 3 garlic compounds (Fig. 13H), suggesting that any nonsignificant increase in GST activity would not be sufficient to protect the cells from
significantly increased ROS-mediated cell death.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that the garlic compounds
(DAS, DADS, and DATS) are effective for the induction of apoptosis in human glioblastoma T98G and
U87MG cells (Figs. 1–13). Based on the results, we
propose a schematic diagram to show different components and pathways leading to apoptosis in glioblastoma cells after treatment with garlic compounds
(Fig. 14).
Production of ROS may play a role in causing
apoptosis via death receptor and mitochondria.5,21
Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induces apoptosis,
whereas phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK exerts
cytoprotective effects.22,23 We detected phosphorylation of p38 MAKP but not p42/44 MAPK in glioblastoma cells after exposure to DAS and DADS. A
decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by a specific inhibitor (SB203580) markedly decreased induction of apoptosis (data not shown). The addition of
Asc completely blocked the phosphorylation of p38
MAPK, suggesting the involvement of ROS in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Thus, production of ROS
provided a signal for selective phosphorylation of
p38 MAPK and induction of apoptosis in glioblastoma cells after treatment with garlic compounds.
Pretreatment of cells with the JNK inhibitor I (a synthetic peptide) demonstrated a reduction in cell
death, suggesting an essential role of JNK1 in induc-

tion of apoptosis in glioblastoma cells treated with
garlic compounds. The JNK inhibitor I inhibits apoptosis due to specific inhibition of phosphorylation
of JNK1, indicating involvement of the JNK1 pathway
in apoptosis.22,23 In addition, an increase in intracellular free [Ca21] is known to cause apoptosis in

several cell culture models.12 Garlic compounds
increased intracellular free [Ca21] in glioblastoma
cells, suggesting that induction of apoptosis also
required activation of Ca21-dependent pathways.

on our results, we suggest that garlic compounds
activate multiple pathways for induction of apoptosis
in glioblastoma cells. It should be noted that garlic
compounds do not require a p53-dependent pathway
for mediation of apoptosis because they are capable
of inducing apoptosis in both T98G (containing mutant p53) and U87MG (containing wild-type p53)
cells.
In conclusion, the garlic compounds (DAS,
DADS, and DATS) were found to exert cytotoxic
effects via ROS production for signaling the activation of stress kinases and cysteine proteases for apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells.

from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into
the cytosol.24 Cytochrome c then interacts with procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 to activate caspase-9 and then
switch on caspase-3 activity, leading to apoptosis.24
Thus, we examined the levels of Bax and Bcl-2 and
found an increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of
caspase-9 in glioblastoma cells after treatment with
garlic compounds. Smac was also released from mitochondria in glioblastoma cells treated with garlic
compounds. The inhibitory effects of various BIRC
proteins on apoptosis have previously been shown in
different cell culture models.25,26 Because Smac could
suppress survival effects of BIRC proteins, we examined alteration in the levels of BIRC proteins in T98G
and U87MG cells after treatment with garlic compounds and found that some of these survival proteins (BIRC-2 to BIRC-5) were down-regulated for
promoting apoptosis.
In the course of this investigation, we discovered
that calreticulin plays a key role in ER stressmediated apoptosis in glioblastoma cells after treatment with garlic compounds. We also observed caspase-4 activation that contributed to cell death in
glioblastoma cells. In addition, proteolytic activities
of calpain and caspase-3 were increased, Bid was
cleaved to tBid, calpastatin was down-regulated, and
ICAD was cleaved to release and translocate CAD to
the nucleus. It is interesting to note that the most
potent garlic compound, DATS, at a low dose
induced cell death in glioblastoma cells. We used
specific inhibitors to confirm that glioblastoma cells
committed cell death with activation of proteolytic
activities of calpain, caspase-9, and caspase-3. Based
