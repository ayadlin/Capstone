ABSTRACT
Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are frequently activated in T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), mainly due to the loss of PTEN function.
Therefore, targeting PI3Ks is a promising innovative approach for T-ALL treatment,
however at present no definitive evidence indicated which is the better therapeutic
strategy between pan or selective isoform inhibition, as all the four catalytic subunits
might participate in leukemogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that in both PTEN
deleted and PTEN non deleted T-ALL cell lines, PI3K pan-inhibition exerted the
highest cytotoxic effects when compared to both selective isoform inhibition or dual
p110γ/δ inhibition. Intriguingly, the dual p110γ/δ inhibitor IPI-145 was effective in
Loucy cells, which are representative of early T-precursor (ETP)-ALL, a T-ALL subtype
associated with a poor outcome. PTEN gene deletion did not confer a peculiar reliance
of T-ALL cells on PI3K activity for their proliferation/survival, as PTEN was inactivated
in PTEN non deleted cells, due to posttranslational mechanisms. PI3K pan-inhibition
suppressed Akt activation and induced caspase-independent apoptosis. We further
demonstrated that in some T-ALL cell lines, autophagy could exert a protective role
against PI3K inhibition. Our findings strongly support clinical application of class I
PI3K pan-inhibitors in T-ALL treatment, with the possible exception of ETP-ALL cases.

molecules [1]. Among the binding partners, there are the
serine-threonine protein kinases Akt and phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Recruitment to the plasma
membrane brings these two proteins in close proximity,
allowing PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate Akt which
in turn phosphorylates target proteins affecting cell
growth, cell cycle progression, and cell survival [2].
The activation of the PI3K pathway is controlled by
the 3′-phosphate lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase
and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) which

prevents the accumulation of PIP3 converting it back into
PIP2 [3]. Members of class I PI3Ks are further divided
into two subfamilies, class IA consisting of a p85α,
p85β or p55γ regulatory subunit and a p110α, p110β or
p110δ catalytic subunit, and class IB consisting of a p101
regulatory subunit and a p110γ catalytic subunit, which
receive activation inputs from tyrosine kinases or GTPase
signaling, respectively [1]. Unlike the ubiquitous p110α
and p110β, p110δ and p110γ isoforms are preferentially
expressed in leucocytes [4]. PI3K regulates many steps
in the development, differentiation, and activation
of T-cells. p110δ and p110γ are widely involved in
thymocyte development and differentiation, especially
during β-selection and transition between immature
DP (double positive) and mature SP (single positive)
thymocytes [4, 5]. Nevertheless, PI3K subunits seem to
have a redundant role, and other isoforms could markedly
impact T cell development [6]. Due to the crucial role of
PI3Ks in regulating cell cycle, metabolism, and survival,
the PI3K signaling cascade is one of the most frequently
altered pathways in human cancers [7–9], and different
compounds targeting members of the PI3K network have
been developed and entered clinical trials [1].
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
is an aggressive neoplastic disorder of T-lymphocytes
characterized by a poor clinical outcome, especially
for relapsed patients [10]. In T-ALL, the PI3K pathway
is frequently up-regulated mainly due to alterations,
including phosphorylation, oxidation and gene deletion/
mutation, that affect PTEN function [11–13]. Deregulation
of the PI3K signaling pathway confers a proliferative
advantage to malignant cells and might contribute
to drug-resistance mechanisms. Therefore, targeting
PI3K pathway may be an attractive novel therapeutic
intervention in T-ALL. However, which class of agents
among isoform-specific or pan-inhibitors can achieve the
greater efficacy is still an open question. Indeed, if on
the one hand the use of selective inhibitors might reduce
systemic toxicity, on the other hand pan-inhibitors could
display increased efficacy. In relation to this issue, it has
been documented that PTEN-null T-ALL cells exclusively
relied on p110γ and p110δ, as their combined absence
decreased the tumor incidence in a PTEN-deficient
mouse model, suggesting their predominant roles in
sustaining malignant transformation [14]. Moreover, in
human T-ALL cells devoid of PTEN, pharmacological
blockade of both p110γ and p110δ impacted on tumor
cell proliferation and survival, supporting the relevance of
these isoforms as therapeutic targets for T-ALL treatment
[14]. On the contrary, a more recent study highlighted
the importance of blocking all class I PI3K isoforms to
efficiently inhibit cell proliferation in PTEN deficient
T-ALL cell lines [15]. However, in T-ALL patients PTEN
genomic alterations are low frequency events, as PTEN
gene deletions and mutations predicted to cause protein

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

truncation occur collectively in about 10% of T-ALL cases
[11, 12, 16]. In T-ALL, the predominant mechanisms
responsible for PTEN functional inactivation and
constitutive PI3K pathway activation are phosphorylation
and/or oxidation, which have been detected at level
above of control thymocytes in 91.7% and 81.3% of
primary T-ALL samples, respectively [11]. Therefore,
in the present study we aimed to further investigate the
effects of PI3K inhibition in both PTEN deleted and non
deleted T-ALL cell lines. For this purpose, we employed
a pharmacological approach to compare the effects of
selective and PI3K pan-inhibition. We used compounds
which specifically target p110α, p110β, p110γ, and
p110δ PI3K catalytic subunits, along with dual p110γ/
p110δ and pan-PI3K inhibitors, and we evaluated their
effects on leukemic cell proliferation and survival. Our
results demonstrated that PI3K pan-inhibition exerted
the most powerful effects on leukemic cell proliferation
and survival in all the tested cell lines, irrespectively
of PTEN status, with the possible exception of Loucy
cells. Therefore, our findings strongly support clinical
application of class I PI3K pan-inhibitors rather than dual
γ/δ or single-isoform inhibitors for the treatment of the
major part of T-ALL patients.

RESULTS
In vitro assessment of PI3K inhibitor effects on
cell viability
In order to establish the role of the different
PI3K catalytic subunits in supporting leukemic cells
proliferation and survival, we exploited a pharmacological
approach by using selective inhibitors, dual p110γ/δ, or
pan-inhibitors. The pan-inhibitor BKM-120 has been
evaluated in both preclinical hematologic and solid
tumor models [17, 18] and phase I clinical trials [19–21],
whereas ZSTK-474 [22–24] and PIK-90 [15] efficacy has
been assessed only in preclinical models. To specifically
inhibit p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ we employed
A-66, TGX-221, CAL-101, and AS-605240, respectively,
whose selectivity has been reported elsewhere [14, 15, 25],
and that, at least in several instances, have shown
effectiveness in hematological malignancies [26]. Because
of the prominent role of p110δ and p110γ isoforms in
T-lymphocytes [5], effects of the γ/δ dual inhibitor ­IPI-145,
as well as of a combination consisting of CAL-101 and
AS-605240 were also evaluated. Several clinical trials
have shown the efficacy of CAL-101, which displayed
substantial anti-leukemic effects as single agent in both
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [27] and indolent
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) [28] patients with an
acceptable safety profile. On this basis, the dual inhibitor
IPI-145, initially developed as an anti-inflammatory drug
[29], has been tested in phase I clinical trials enrolling

relapsed/refractory lymphoma [30] or advanced CLL
[31]. Results suggested that the drug is safe and effective
and encouraged further evaluation of IPI-145 as a targeted
drug also in newly diagnosed CLL patients.
Cells were cultured with increasing concentrations
of the drugs for 48 h followed by metabolic activity
assessment by MTT assay (Fig. 1A and 1C). In both
PTEN deleted (Jurkat and Loucy) and PTEN non deleted
(DND-41 and ALL-SIL) cells, growth rate decreased
after treatment with BKM-120 and ZSTK-474 with IC50
values ranging between 1.05–2.34 μM for BKM-120
and 0.99–3.39 μM for ZSTK-474. Conversely, PIK-90
only mildly affected T-ALL cell line viability, with the
exception of Loucy cells (IC50 0.096 μM). As expected,
selective inhibition of p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ
isoforms resulted ineffective, with IC50 values not attained

at the tested concentrations. We further investigated
the effectiveness of combining p110δ and p110γ
inhibitors, by treating T-ALL cell lines with CAL-101
and AS-605240 at a fixed ratio (1:1). As shown in Fig.
1B and 1D, the inhibitors resulted in a strong (CI < 0.3)
to moderate (CI < 0.9) synergism in ALL-SIL, Loucy,
and Jurkat cells at concentrations above 1 μM, whereas
in DND-41 cells the drug combination did not exert a
synergistic but rather an antagonistic (at 1 and 2 μM)
or additive (at 4 and 8 μM) effect. Nevertheless, IC50
values achieved by the combined treatment were much
higher compared to those of pan-inhibitors (Fig. 1C).
Interestingly, the dual p110γ/δ inhibitor IPI-145 was
effective only in Loucy cells. Overall, PI3K isoform
pan-inhibition was much more efficient in affecting
T-ALL cell viability when compared to specific as well

displayed an irregular pattern. Jurkat and DND-41 cell
proliferation was unaffected, conversely in Loucy and
ALL-SIL cells either p110δ inhibition or dual p110γ/δ
inhibition significantly impaired cell growth (Fig. 2A).
Compared to untreated controls, ZSTK-474 markedly
slowed down the doubling time in Loucy, DND-41, and
ALL-SIL cells, whereas a negative doubling time was
estimated in Jurkat cells, suggesting cell death induction
(Fig. 2C). Importantly, in Loucy cells, the only cell
line responsive to IPI-145, proliferation was impaired
already at 0.5 μM after treatment with this dual inhibitor
(Fig. 2B and 2C).
To ascertain whether the observed effects of
ZSTK-474 on cell growth rate were due to a proliferative
impairment, we also evaluated by flow cytometry the
expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67, a nuclear
antigen which is a well established marker of cell

PI3K pan-inhibition affects cell proliferation in a
PTEN independent fashion
We investigated in more detail the effects of
the PI3K pathway inhibition on cell proliferation, by
analyzing the long-term cell growth over 3 days posttreatment with the drugs. The pan-inhibitor ZSTK-474
significantly impaired cell proliferation in all the cell lines,
independently from PTEN status, whereas p110α and
p110β inhibition produced negligible effects (Fig.  2A).

proliferation [32]. In agreement with the growth analyses,
Ki-67 decreased broadly in all the cell lines after 72 h
treatment with the pan-inhibitor ZSTK-474 (Fig. 2D).
These results demonstrated that overall PI3K paninhibition impaired cell proliferation more efficiently than
dual p110γ/δ inhibition.

Firstly, we investigated cell lines with regard
to PI3K isoforms and PTEN expression. As shown in
Fig. 3A, the catalytic subunits p110α, −β, −γ and −δ

were expressed in control as well as treated samples to
a similar extent. As expected, PTEN protein was absent
in Jurkat and Loucy cells, but abundantly expressed and
unaffected by drug treatments in ALL-SIL and DND-41
cells. Nevertheless, in both of these cell lines, PTEN was
phosphorylated at Ser380, which is a marker of PTEN
posttranslational inactivation by CK2 and consequent
PI3K pathway activation [12, 33].
To evaluate the impact of the inhibitors on PI3K
activity, total PIP3 levels were then quantified by flow
cytometry [11]. Pan-inhibition was able to induce a
significant reduction of PIP3 in all cell lines after a 6 h
treatment with the drugs. Regarding the isoform selective
inhibitors, all the compounds induced a decrease in
PIP3 levels, suggesting that each PI3K catalytic isoform
could contribute to PIP2 phosphorylation in T-ALL cells
(Fig. 3B). However, there were differences related to the
cell type. While in Jurkat cells all the inhibitors drastically
decreased PIP3, in the other cell lines a significant decrease
in PIP3 could be detected only with some of the inhibitors
(CAL-101 in DND-41; A-66, AS-605240 and combination
of AS-605240 plus CAL-101 in ALL-SIL; A-66, CAL-101
and combination of AS-605240 plus CAL-101 in Loucy
cells). Moreover, PIP3 decreased in a concentrationdependent fashion in Loucy cells treated with the dual
p110γ/δ inhibitor IPI-145 (0.5, 1 and 5 μM; Fig. 3B).

These observations suggested a peculiar addiction to
PI3K isoforms of the different cell lines with regard to
PIP2 phosphorylation, suggesting a potential influence of
cellular-specific mechanisms in PIP3 generation. However,
PIP3 reduction did not fully correlate with the observed
anti-proliferative effects induced by the inhibitors.
Taken together, these data demonstrated that each
isoform can sustain PIP3 synthesis in T-ALL cells, but
PIP3 total cellular amount was not fully related to cellular
proliferation.

PI3K pan-inhibition impairs Akt-mediated
signaling
We next examined the effects of the different
inhibitors on signaling downstream of PI3K. One of the
major PI3K targets is the serine/threonine kinase Akt,
which is recruited to the plasma membrane through direct
interaction with PIP3 and subsequent phosphorylation
on Thr308 by PDK1 and Ser473 by mTORC2 for full
activation [7]. In all cell lines, selective p110α, −β or −γ
inhibition was unable to reduce Akt phosphorylation at
Thr308, whereas both p110δ and dual p110γ/δ inhibition
induced a comparable decrease, suggesting a major role
for the p110δ isoform in the phosphorylation of this Akt
amino acidic residue (Fig. 4A). Conversely, ­pan-inhibition

in the presence of 5 μM of the different PI3K inhibitors, as indicated, and western blot analysis was then performed. The pan-inhibitor
ZSTK-474 and the combination of p110γ and p110δ inhibitors (AS-605240 and CAL-101) induced the dephosphorylation of the main
PI3K downstream targets Akt, P70S6K , and S6RP (A and B) but only ZSTK-474 decreased both the phosphorylated residues of Akt,
Thr308 and Ser473. Only in Loucy cells, the dual p110γ/δ inhibitor IPI-145 exerted a concentration-dependent activity on PI3K downstream
targets. (C) The phosphorylation of PDK1, PKCα and PKCβII was not modulated by inhibition of PI3K. Thirty μg of protein was blotted to

To formally prove that, we treated T-ALL cell lines with­
ZSTK-474 in the presence or absence of the pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Aspfluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk). As presented in Fig. 5D,
cell death induced by pan-inhibition was not affected by
caspase inhibition.
Overall, these results demonstrated that PI3K
inhibition caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 cell phase but
only pan-inhibition was able to efficiently induce cell
death with a caspase-independent mechanism.

exerted the strongest effect on Akt activation, with a
complete abrogation of phosphorylation at Thr308.
Most importantly, only pan-inhibition induced a significant
reduction of Akt phosphorylated at Ser473, either after
6 h (Jurkat, Loucy, and DND-41 cells; Fig. 4A) or 24 h
(ALL-SIL cells; Fig. 4B) treatment, suggesting mTORC2
inhibition. Analysis of Akt downstream targets showed a
congruent pattern of dephosphorylation, with a decrease
in p-P70S6K both at Thr421/Ser424 (auto-inhibitory
domain) and at Thr389 (mTORC1 phosphorylation site),
and p-S6RP at Ser235/236, after pan- or, to a lesser
extent, dual p110γ/δ inhibition (Fig. 4A). In all cases, total
protein levels were unaffected. Consistently with the cell
viability and proliferation analyses, only in the Loucy cell
line down-modulation of p110γ/δ activity with the dual
inhibitor IPI-145 was as effective as PI3K pan-inhibition
and displayed a concentration-dependent trend (Fig. 4A).
To assess if other targets beyond Akt could be
affected by PI3K inhibition, we further investigated PDK1
and some of its downstream targets, PKCα and PKCβ
(Fig. 4C). We observed that neither selective, nor dual
or pan-inhibitors reduced phosphorylated levels of PKC
isoforms [34]. Therefore, block of PI3K activity mainly
inhibited Akt and its downstream targets.

Autophagy is a protective mechanism against
PI3K pan-inhibition
Autophagy is a homeostatic cellular process which
regulates protein and organelle turnover through their
lysosomal destruction [35]. However, autophagy also
executes cell death, and autophagic cell death is one of the
better recognized caspase-independent programmed cell
death mechanisms [36]. To analyze possible autophagy
induction, we investigated the expression of LC3B
I/II, a recognized autophagy marker [37]. Western blot
analysis demonstrated a marked increase in LC3B II,
the lipidated form of the protein which is bound to the
autophagosome membranes, in Loucy, ALL-SIL and
DND-41 cells, especially following 24 h ZSTK-474
treatment, whereas no changes were observed in Jurkat
cells (Fig. 6A). Because PI3K pan-inhibition with ZTK474 treatment induced a considerable percentage of cell
death in Jurkat cells compared to the other cell lines, we
supposed a protective role of autophagy in this context.
To test our hypothesis, we inhibited autophagy with
the early-stage autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine­
(3-MA) and subsequently evaluated cell death induced
by treatment with ZSTK-474. The results demonstrated
that 3-MA increased the cytotoxic effect of pan PI3K
inhibition, as the percentage of Annexin V/PI positive cells
was significantly higher in Loucy, ALL-SIL, and DND-41
cells compared to that of samples treated with ZSTK-474
alone (Fig. 6B). On the contrary, in Jurkat cells, where
pan-inhibition did not induce LC3B lipidation, inhibition
of autophagy did not increase cytotoxicity (Fig. 6B). To
ascertain whether the different behavior between Jurkat
cells and the other cell lines was related to a different
modulation of autophagy-related genes, a screening for
gene expression was performed using a quantitative realtime PCR assay which interrogates 82 genes related to the
autophagic pathway (Tab. 1 and Fig. 6C). Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering showed similarities in autophagy
gene expression in each paired cell line (untreated and
treated samples) (Fig. 6C), although untreated Loucy cells
showed a basal higher expression of these genes compared
to the other cell lines. Moreover, no differentially clustered
transcripts were observed in Jurkat cells, despite the fact
that this cell line did not activate the autophagy process

Anti-proliferative activity of PI3K pan-inhibition
acts through cell cycle arrest and caspaseindependent apoptosis
Since PI3K/Akt signaling controls different cellular
pathways, we examined the inhibitor effects on cell cycle
and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, cell cycle was
affected in all the cell lines following pan-inhibition
(ZSTK-474 treatment for 48 h) (Fig. 5A). Flow cytometric
analysis documented an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1
phase of the cell cycle and a consequent decrease of cells
in the S or G2/M phases, as previously reported [23],
which reached a statistical significance in ALL-SIL and
DND-41 cells. Moreover, in Jurkat, Loucy, and ALLSIL cells, ZSTK-474 increased the subG1 cell fraction,
which comprises death cells. Less dramatic effects were
observed with the other inhibitors, which affected only
ALL-SIL and Loucy cells. In particular, the combination of
AS-605240 and CAL-101 altered cell cycle phase
distribution in Loucy cells, by increasing the G0/G1 fraction.
However, the dual γ/δ inhibitor IPI-145 had no effects.
Annexin V-FITC/PI analysis confirmed a significant
increase in apoptotic cells following treatment with ZSTK474 for 48 h in all the cell lines, whereas dual p110γ/δ
inhibition had limited effects, inducing a significant cell
death only in the Loucy cell line (Fig. 5B).
Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated the
absence of cleaved effector caspase 3 both at 24 and 48 h
of treatment with the inhibitors (Fig. 5C and data not shown)
suggesting that caspases did not contribute to cell death.

WIPI1, MAP1LC3B, and ATG16L2, all involved in
autophagic vesicle nucleation and expansion, as well
as increased expression of genes involved in autophagy
induction and regulation (INS, PIK3C) or prosurvival
genes (BCL2, EIF2AK3). In contrast, in Jurkat cells,
pan-inhibition had limited effects on autophagy-related
gene induction, as the only upregulated gene was ULK1.
However, we observed a > 2 fold change in expression of
the tumor suppressor gene CDKN1B, as well as in CTSS
(cathepsin S) gene. Interestingly, low levels of cathepsin S
or its pharmacological inhibition have been related to the
induction of autophagy in cancer cells [38, 39].
These results demonstrated that PI3K pan-inhibition
could induce autophagy which plays a protective role in

following PI3K pan-inhibition. Nevertheless, we further
investigated the modulation of autophagy in more detail, by
comparing for each cell line untreated and treated samples
and assessing for each gene the fold change, expressed as
2−∆∆Ct. A 24 h treatment with ZSTK-474 had limited effects
on autophagy at a transcriptional level, as the majority of
genes resulted expressed equally to the control (2−∆∆Ct = 1)

with or without the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (200 μM) and cell death fraction was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Autophagy
inhibition significantly increased cell death in Loucy, ALL-SIL, and DND-41 cell lines, whereas it did not affect Jurkat cells. Results are the
mean of three different experiments ± SD. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences with respect to untreated cells (*p < 0.05; 
**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). C. Real-time PCR expression profiling of 82 autophagy-related genes in T-ALL cell lines untreated (Ctr) or
treated for 24 h with 5 μM ZSTK-474 were visualized using an unsupervised heat map. Data are presented as 2−∆Ct (∆Ct = Ct target gene – Ct RLP0).
D. Histograms represent the relative gene expression of several autophagy-related genes in T-ALL cells treated with ZSTK-474 and
compared to untreated paired sample. Data are presented as 2−∆∆Ct (∆∆Ct = ∆Ct treated sample – ∆Ct Ctr sample). When fold change values are = 1,
the regulation in treated samples is equal to the paired control sample. When fold change values are > 1 or < 1, the autophagy-related genes
are up- or down-regulated, respectively, compared to untreated samples.

oncogenic potential of p110β [43] has emerged in breast
[44] and prostate cancers [45]. Tumor cells addiction to
the activity of specific class I PI3K isoforms had led to
the development of therapies based on the application
of selective PI3K inhibitors which target the catalytic
subunits [46]. In T-ALL, PI3K signaling up-regulation
has been found in nearly 90% of cases [11] and targeting
PI3K is an attractive novel strategy to treat these patients.
Nevertheless, at present is still controversial the role
carried out by the different PI3K catalytic subunits in
T-ALL and, therefore, which might be the most useful
therapeutic strategy. It is well established that both
p110γ and p110δ, enriched in leucocytes, are involved
in thymocyte development [5]. The catalytic subunits

DISCUSSION
PI3K signaling is often deregulated in malignancies
and contribute to the oncogenic process. The mechanisms
responsible for class I PI3Ks up-regulation diverge
among the distinct tumors. For example, gain of function
mutations in PIK3CA, that encodes the catalytic subunit
p110α, have been detected in a wide variety of human
solid cancers [40], whereas p110δ is implicated in cancers
derived from B lymphoid cells [41, 42]. Recently, the

that all the PI3K isoforms contribute to its synthesis in
T-ALL cells. However, inhibitor effects on PIP3 levels did
not fully correlate with their cytotoxicity. This apparent
contradiction might be due to the presence of different
PIP3 pools which mediate specific cellular processes,
so that reduction of total PIP3 could not fully reflect the
impairment of cell proliferation/survival mechanisms
[52]. Moreover, it is emerging that PI3K could control
other downstream targets in cancer cells, including
serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (SGK3), in a
manner which is independent from PIP3, but dependent on
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [53].
Only PI3K pan-inhibition switched off Akt
signaling, as demonstrated by the reduction or complete
abrogation of both Thr308 and Ser473 p-Akt levels. It
has been previously reported that a limited PI3K activity
is sufficient to support cell survival and proliferation
and, consequently, complete PI3K inhibition is required
to induce cell death [48]. Consistent with that, in spite
of changes in cell cycle progression, we observed a
significant cell death induction almost exclusively after
PI3K pan-inhibition, with the exception of Loucy cells
where the dual inhibition of p110γ/δ was also effective.
Importantly, we demonstrated that, at least in the case of
ZSTK-474, the mechanisms involved in cell death are
independent of caspase activity as a pan-caspase inhibitor
did not reduce cell death.
Numerous studies have highlighted the existence
of various types of programmed cell death besides
apoptosis, including autophagy, an important catabolic
mechanism which can play both a pro-survival or prodeath role [54]. Importantly, PI3K and autophagy
pathways are tightly related, as mTORC1 suppress
autophagy by inhibiting ULK1, and the transcription
factor FoxO3, which is inhibited by active Akt, regulates
a number of autophagy-related genes, including LC3,
GABARAPL1, BNIP3, PIK3C3, and ULK1 [35, 55, 56].
Our findings demonstrated that activation of autophagy
can sustain cell survival after PI3K pan-inhibition. In
fact, inhibitors that interfere with the autophagic flux
increased the cytotoxic effects of ZSTK-474. However,
autophagy activation took place only in some T-ALL
cell lines, suggesting the influence of a more complex
cellular background. To address this issue we examined
the expression of autophagy-related genes. No specific
expression profiles resulted related to autophagy activation
or PI3K pan-inhibition and overall gene expression of
paired samples was similar. Neverthelss, inhibition of
PI3K specifically modulated a few genes that might
trigger autophagy. While the Loucy cell line displayed a
higher autophagy gene expression profile already at basal
level, we observed the up-regulation of genes involved
in the autophagic machinery and regulation in all the
T-ALL cell lines we studied. Increase of these transcripts
appeared to be cell type-dependent, as ALL-SIL,­

p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed so that it is
extremely difficult to dissect their role in lymphocytes, due
to the embryonic lethality induced by loss of either p110α
or p110β [47]. However, there is a complex interplay
between the class I PI3K members, as inhibition or loss of
a specific isoform might be compensated by the others in
interleukin-3-dependent mouse hematopoietic cells [48].
Moreover, recent findings have highlighted that in solid
tumors inhibition of a single PI3K isoform (either α or β)
could be compensated by reactivation of another isoform
[49, 50].
Recently, Subramanian et al., by employing the dual
γ/δ inhibitor CAL-130, proposed the predominant role of
p110γ and p110δ in PTEN deleted T-ALL, suggesting
the possibility to target this malignancy by inhibiting
specifically these isoforms [14]. It should be underscored,
however, that after this initial report, no other papers
dealing with the effects of CAL-130 have been published.
In contrast, a more recent work contradicted these results,
showing higher cytotoxic effects of the PI3K pan-inhibitor,
PIK-90, in PTEN deleted T-ALL cell lines [15]. However,
both of these studies did not take into account that PTEN
deletions or inactivating gene mutations are relatively
rare in primary T-ALL patients, whereas posttranslational
inactivation of PTEN is a much more frequent event
[11]. In light of those contradictory findings, we have
used isoform-selective, pan- and dual p110γ/δ inhibitors
to compare their effects in both PTEN deleted and non
deleted T-ALL cell lines. Our results demonstrated that
blockage of all the class I PI3K catalytic isoforms exerted
a greater anti-cancer effect compared to dual p110γ/δ
inhibition, as exemplified by the lower IC50 attained in
all the cell lines, whereas isoform-selective inhibition
produced negligible effects. Among the three PI3K paninhibitors we tested, PIK-90 was effective only in Loucy
cells, highlighting that chemical structure might affect
drug efficacy. Moreover, only Loucy cells were sensitive
to the dual γ/δ inhibitor, IPI-145. The peculiar sensitivity
of Loucy cells to PI3K pathway inhibition is remarkable,
as this cell line displays a transcriptional signature
similar to that of early T-precursor (ETP)-ALL, a T-ALL
subtype associated with an extremely poor prognosis
[51]. Therefore, it will be very critical to test this drug on
primary cells derived from patients with ETP-ALL.
Moreover, we did not observe differences between
PTEN deleted and non deleted cell lines. Indeed, despite
the expression of PTEN protein, we confirmed that in
non deleted cells, PTEN was phosphorylated at Ser380
and thus inactivated. This observation underlines the
importance of assessing PI3K pathway activation in
T-ALL patients rather than just PTEN deletions/mutations,
for a better evaluation of patient outcome or possible
therapeutic intervention with pathway modulators. We
also observed a decrease in total PIP3 levels following
inhibition of each PI3K catalytic subunit, suggesting

DND-41 and, partially, Loucy cells, which activated
autophagy after PI3K pan-inhibition, up-regulated
numerous genes involved in the formation of
autophagosomes (DRAM1, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2,
MAP1LC3B, ATG16L2, WIPI1, PIK3C3), as well as antiapoptotic genes (BCL2) and genes of the unfolded protein
response signaling (EIF2AK3). Conversely, in Jurkat
cells, which did not activate autophagy, gene modulation
was affected to a much lower extent and preferentially
involved anti-proliferative targets, as the cell cycle
inhibitor CDKN1B, and the autophagy inhibitor CTSS.
These observations suggest a role for the PI3K pathway
in modulating at a transcriptional level the complex
relationship between pro- and anti-survival signals and
ultimately the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.
Of course, more studies are needed to clarify these
relationships.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a higher
efficacy of PI3K pan-inhibition in both PTEN deleted and
non deleted T-ALL cell lines. Although dual inhibition of
p110γ/δ PI3K isoforms could be less toxic and reduce side
effects [25], its efficacy might be limited only to the subset
of T-ALL patients with ETP-ALL. Moreover, our findings
shed light about the protective role of autophagy in case
of PI3K pan-inhibition, supporting the evaluation of
combining autophagy inhibitors for increasing citotoxicity
induced by PI3K inhibition. Further investigation will be
necessary to discriminate the cellular contexts responsible
for autophagy activation. Addressing this question will
be critical to select which T-ALL patients may best
benefit from a therapeutic strategy involving class I PI3K
inhibition. Indeed, progress in better understanding the
biology of different T-ALL subtypes should help the
development of personalized therapy targeted at blocking
multiple defective signaling pathways of leukemic
cells [57].

To test the effects of PI3K inhibitors, T-ALL
cell lines were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the
vehicle (DMSO 0.1%) or increasing drug concentrations,
and cell viability was determined using the MTT [3-(4,
5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] cell proliferation kit (Roche Diagnostic, Basel,
Switzerland), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For drug-combination experiments, a combination index
(CI) number was calculated using the CalcuSyn software
(Cambridge, UK) based on the Chou and Talalay method
[58]. CI values between 0.1–0.9 define different grades
of synergism, values between 0.9–1.1 are additive,
whereas values > 1.1 are antagonistic. Growth curves
were generated by counting viable and non-viable cell
numbers by the Trypan blue dye exclusion method. Cells
were seeded in 6-well plates, treated with the inhibitors
(5 μM) or the vehicle alone (DMSO 0.1%) and counted at
regular intervals up to 72 h. Doubling time was calculated
with Roth V. 2006 (http://www.doubling-time.com/
compute.php).

Flow cytometry analysis of Ki-67 and PIP3
In order to evaluate effects on proliferation, Ki-67
antigen expression during the different phases of cell
cycle was evaluated. After 72 h treatment, cells were
permeabilized with methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and
incubated with a primary antibody to Ki-67 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Afterwards,
samples were stained for 1 h with a FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA)
followed by further 20 min incubation with Propidium
Iodide (PI). To detect PIP3 levels, control (DMSO 0.1%)
and treated (6 h) cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10
min, washed in PSB 1X with 1% BSA and incubated over
night at 4°C with a FITC-conjugated anti-PIP3 antibody
(Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Analyses
were performed on an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter) with the appropriate software (CXP, Beckman
Coulter).

Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated either from control (DMSO
0.1%) and from 24 h ZSTK-474 treated cells using
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration
was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm;
for all samples, the OD 260/OD 280 absorbance ratio
was of at least 2.0. 3.5 μg of total RNA were reversetranscribed into cDNA using the iScriptTM Advanced
cDNA Syntesis Kit (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Gene
expression of specific autophagy markers was measured
using the PrimePCRTM Assay for real-time (Bio-rad). For
each sample, cDNA was mixed with 2x SsoAdvancedTM
universal supermix (25 ng cDNA/reaction) containing
SYBR Green (Bio-rad) and aliquoted in equal volumes
to each well of the real-time PCR arrays. The quantitative
PCR reaction was performed using a 7300 Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The quantitative PCR thermal protocol consisted
of 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C
for 5 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds. RLP0 was used
as control gene and the relative gene expression among
samples was calculated as 2−∆Ct [61]. These data were then
subjected to hierarchical clustering using the Spearman’s
rank correlation metric and the average-linkage method
and heatmaps were generated using the data analysis tool
TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (http://www.tm4.org/)
[62]. To examine the effects of pan PI3K inhibition in
the different cell lines, gene expression of the treated cell
lines was compared with that of untreated control and fold
change due to the treatment was expressed as 2−∆∆Ct [61].
A 2.0-fold change in gene expression was used as the cutoff threshold.
