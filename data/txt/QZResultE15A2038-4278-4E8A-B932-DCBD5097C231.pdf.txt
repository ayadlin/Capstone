BACKGROUND: Double-hit lymphomas (DHLs) are collectively defined as B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas harboring rearrangements
of MYC as well as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and/or B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6). To the authors’ knowledge, the impact of specific
oncogene rearrangements on outcomes of patients with DHL who are treated with immunochemotherapy has not been previously
described. METHODS: The authors identified patients whose diagnostic tissue specimens underwent metaphase karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization for MYC as well as both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements. Cohorts were defined by the presence (1) or
absence (2) of rearrangements: MYC1/BCL21/BCL62 (BCL2-DHL), MYC1/BCL22/BCL61 (BCL6-DHL), and MYC1/BCL21/BCL61
(triple-hit lymphoma; THL). RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included in the current analysis (76 BCL2-DHL patients, 16 BCL6DHL patients, and 25 THL patients). Compared with patients with BCL2-DHL, those with BCL6-DHL were more likely to be classified
as having a non-germinal center cell of origin, presented with extranodal disease, and appeared to achieve higher rates of complete
response despite receiving intensive induction therapy less frequently. However, patients with BCL6-DHL experienced a shorter median overall survival if achieving an initial complete response compared with patients with BCL2-DHL. Patients with THL experienced
survival outcomes similar to those of patients with BCL2-DHL. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the specific oncogene rearrangements

INTRODUCTION
Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) is most commonly defined as a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) with rearrangements of MYC as well as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), or, rarely, other oncogenes.1-3 Although
patients with DHL frequently are analyzed as a single cohort, a few published reports have specifically described patients
with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements4,5; MYC and BCL6 rearrangements6,7; or MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements
(so-called triple-hit lymphoma [THL])8 individually or distinguished these DHL subtypes within a larger case series.9 However, the inconsistency of uniform testing for all 3 gene rearrangements as well as the lack of clear reporting of outcomes
based on treatment received have limited the current understanding of potential differences in DHL based on genetic profile.
Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of patients with DHL by genetic subtype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From our previously described database of patients with DHL,3 we identified patients whose diagnostic tissue specimens
underwent metaphase karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC as well as both BCL2 and BCL6
rearrangements. Cohorts were defined by the presence (1) or absence (2) of rearrangements: MYC1/BCL21/BCL62

(BCL2-DHL), MYC1/BCL22/BCL61 (BCL6-DHL),
and MYC1/BCL21/BCL61 (THL). The histologic
classification of these cases was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with
features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BCLU)/Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL) for most
patients. Cell of origin classification was determined via
immunohistochemical staining (IHC) as per the algorithm of Hans et al.10 Therapy was administered at the
discretion of the treating physician.
Statistical Analysis

Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last documented follow-up.
Categorical variables were analyzed using the Fisher exact
test. Survival times were analyzed using logistic regression
560

and depicted by Kaplan-Meier survival plots. Univariate
and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, and variables with a
2-sided P<.05 on univariate analysis were considered to
be statistically significant and included on multivariate
analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata
statistical software (version 13; StataCorp, College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Of the 311 DHL patients captured in our database, 117
underwent testing for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements (BCL2-DHL in 76 patients, BCL6-DHL in 16
patients, and THL in 25 patients) and were included in
the current analysis. Baseline characteristics are described

tissues specimens classifiable by Hans algorithm, a
germinal center B (GCB) cell of origin was more common
in patients with BCL2-DHL (92%) compared with those
with BCL6-DHL (56%) (P 5.001). Other baseline clinicopathologic features, including histologic classification,
percentage of Ki-67 expression, and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, did not appear to differ significantly based on genetic subtype group.
Treatment received and outcomes are described in
Table 2. Receipt of intensive induction therapy (IIT)
(defined as rituximab-EPOCH [etoposide, prednisone,
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin],
rituximab-hyper-CVAD [hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone

between patients with BCL2-DHL, BCL6-DHL, and
THL (55%, 44%, and 68%, respectively) as was receipt of
any central nervous system prophylaxis (61%, 44%, and
60%, respectively). A trend toward a higher complete
response (CR) rate was noted more often in patients with
BCL6-DHL (75%) compared with those with BCL2DHL (54%; P 5 0.17) and THL (46%; P 5.10). A similar nonstatistically significant trend was found for patients

receiving IIT because those with BCL6-DHL also experienced a higher CR rate (86%) compared with those with
BCL2-DHL (55%; P 5.22) and THL (63%; P 5.37).
Of those patients in first CR (CR1), 14 of 39 patients
with BCL2-DHL (36%), 2 of 12 patients with BCL6DHL (17%), and 6 of 11 patients with THL (55%)
underwent consolidative stem cell transplantation (SCT).
All these patients underwent autologous SCT except for 2
patients each with BCL2-DHL and 2 patients with THL
who underwent allogeneic SCT. The rate of disease recurrence was similar for all patients with BCL2-DHL,
BCL6-DHL, and THL (42%, 50%, and 23%, respectively) as well as for those receiving IIT (36%, 33%, and
25%, respectively).
OS is shown in Figure 1. With a median follow-up
of 24.5 months, the median OS for patients with BCL2DHL, BCL6-DHL, and THL was 34.8 months, 14.5
months, and 17.2 months, respectively (Fig. 1A); if the
patients received IIT, the median OS was 37.5 months,
12.1 months, and not yet reached, respectively (Fig. 1B).
For patients achieving CR1, the median OS was 14.5
months for those with BCL6-DHL and was not yet
reached for patients with BCL2-DHL and THL (Fig.
1C). Patients with BCL2-DHL experienced a significantly longer median OS compared with patients with
BCL6-DHL if achieving CR1 (P 5.02). Valid comparisons of survival outcomes based on receipt of SCT in CR1
could not be made across genetic subtypes due to the small
sample size.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the largest reported series of patients with BCL2-DHL, BCL6DHL, and THL by genetic subtype reported to date, and
analysis of this study highlights 2 important findings.
First, patients with BCL6-DHL may have the poorest
prognosis of all genetic subtypes of DHL. This is supported by an independent analysis of DHL patients by
genetic subtype that demonstrated a significantly shorter
median OS for 13 patients with BCL6-DHL compared
with 20 patients with BCL2-DHL,11 as well as reports of
a median OS of 9 months in 10 patients7 and only 1 of 4
patients surviving >6 months6 in 2 cases series of patients
with BCL6-DHL. It is interesting to note that an analysis
of baseline characteristics did demonstrate a significantly
higher percentage of BCL6-DHL patients to have lymphomas of non-GCB cell of origin compared with BCL2DHL patients and, given the poor prognosis of non-GCB,
high-grade B-NHL, an unfavorable cell of origin may
explain the survival outcomes experienced by patients with
BCL6-DHL. However, univariate analysis did not demonstrate cell of origin to be predictive of OS in patients with
BCL6-DHL, although the relatively small sample size of
patients with BCL6-DHL in the current study should be
acknowledged when interpreting this finding. Because
Cancer

Outcomes by Double-Hit Genetic Subtype/Landsburg et al

BCL6-DHL is underreported in the literature compared
with BCL2-DHL, and therefore potentially underrecognized as a poor prognosis entity in clinical practice, the
results of the current study highlight the importance of
analyzing diagnostic tissue specimens for BCL6 rearrangements to better inform treatment decisions.
Second, despite the presence of a concurrent BCL6
rearrangement, patients with THL may experience outcomes similar to those of patients with BCL2-DHL.
This finding is in agreement with findings reported in a
case series of 14 patients with THL whose survival did
not differ significantly from that of patients with MYC
and BCL2 rearrangements.9 This clinical outcome may
be supported by a pathologic analysis of follicular lymphoma cases that demonstrated that those with only a
BCL2 rearrangement had morphologic characteristics
similar to those with concurrent BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, suggesting that the presence of a BCL6 rearrangement may not affect the phenotype of follicular
lymphomas also containing a BCL2 rearrangement.12
The findings of the current study suggest that the additional BCL6 rearrangement noted in patients with THL
may not indicate a worse prognosis than that of patients
with BCL2-DHL, and clinicians should consider the use
of similar therapies for both groups of patients.
We recognize the limitations of the current analysis.
First, treatment decisions, particularly the use of IIT and
SCT in patients achieving CR1, were not standardized for
patients across institutions. Furthermore, small cohort
sizes, particularly in the BCL6-DHL and THL cohorts,
may have prevented the identification of true differences
in outcome. However, when compared with combined9
or individual series of patients with BCL6-DHL6,7 or
THL,8 we believe the current study represents the largest
comprehensive analysis of patients with BCL2-DHL,
BCL6-DHL, and THL performed to date. In terms of
cytogenetic assays, cutoff values for the reporting of positive FISH results were not standardized across participating institutions; nevertheless, we believe that the cases of
DHL reported herein are valid because tissue specimens
were analyzed by expert cytogeneticists at large academic
medical centers. Furthermore, we included DHL cases
that were diagnosed in part by metaphase karyotype,
which is not as sensitive as FISH for the detection of specified gene rearrangements. However, DHL cases determined by metaphase karyotype also have been included in
other large DHL series,4,9 and we believe that including
these cases in the current analysis is valid.
In addition, the current analysis did not address the
significance of overexpression of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6
Cancer

protein by IHC, a finding that also may carry a poor prognosis in patients with high-grade B-NHL. Increased
expression of MYC and BCL2 protein by IHC (“double
expression”) has been associated with reduced survival in
older,13 but not younger,14 patients with DLBCL treated
with R-CHOP who were enrolled in clinical trials of the
German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study
Group; however, to our knowledge, a biologic rationale
for this difference is unclear. Furthermore, patients with
DLBCL with double expression were reported to have
improved survival in one analysis15 but a similar survival
in another analysis16 compared with patients with BCL2DHL, demonstrating the uncertainty of the prognostic
significance of double expression compared with BCL2DHL. Finally, decreased expression of BCL6 in combination with increased expression of MYC has been associated with reduced survival in patients with DLBCL,13
suggesting that decreased BCL6 expression by IHC may
in fact be predictive of an unfavorable outcome. Given
these reported findings, as well as a lack of standardized
cutoff values used to define increased protein expression
across studies, the significance of overexpression of MYC,
BCL2, and BCL6 by IHC should be carefully considered
by treating clinicians.
The classification of DHL by genetic subtype may
not only be prognostic, but also may be potentially predictive of response to emerging targeted therapies. Responses
to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 as well as the BCL2-specifc
BH3 mimetic ABT-199 alone and in combination with
cytotoxic chemotherapy have been reported in a transgenic mouse model harboring MYC and BCL2 rearrangements,17,18 and patients with recurrent/refractory NHL
achieved an overall response rate of 62% when treated
with ABT-199 combined with immunochemotherapy.19
Although to the best of our knowledge direct BCL6 inhibitors have been studied only in preclinical models,20 the
heat shock protein 90 inhibitor PU-H71 has demonstrated suppression of tumor growth in BCL6-dependent
cell lines21 and is currently being studied in patients with
advanced lymphomas (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01393509).
Oncogene rearrangement patterns may be prognostic for patients with DHL, and the importance of identifying specific oncogene rearrangements may become more
clinically relevant in the near future with the emergence of
oncogene-specific targeted agents.
