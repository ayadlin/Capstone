ABSTRACT
The c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein is deregulated in a large proportion of diverse
human cancers. Considerable effort has therefore been directed at identifying
pharmacologic inhibitors as potential anti-neoplastic agents. Three such groups of
small molecule inhibitors have been described. The first is comprised of so-called
“direct” inhibitors, which perturb Myc’s ability to form productive DNA-binding
heterodimers in association with its partner, Max. The second group is comprised
of indirect inhibitors, which largely function by targeting the BET-domain protein
BRD4 to prevent the proper formation of transcriptional complexes that assemble
in response to Myc-Max DNA binding. Thirdly, synthetic lethal inhibitors cause the
selective apoptosis of Myc over-expressing either by promoting mitotic catastrophe
or altering Myc protein stability. We report here a common mechanism by which all
Myc inhibitors, irrespective of class, lead to eventual cellular demise. This involves
the depletion of ATP stores due to mitochondrial dysfunction and the eventual downregulation of Myc protein. The accompanying metabolic de-regulation causes neutral
lipid accumulation, cell cycle arrest, and an attempt to rectify the ATP deficit by upregulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). These responses are ultimately futile
due to the lack of functional Myc to support the requisite anabolic response. Finally,
the effects of Myc depletion on ATP levels, cell cycle arrest, differentiation and AMPK
activation can be mimicked by pharmacologic inhibition of the mitochondrial electron
transport chain without affecting Myc levels. Thus, all Myc inhibitors promote a global
energy collapse that appears to underlie many of their phenotypic consequences.

INTRODUCTION

importance of this goal is underscored by the fact that Myc
is required for the proliferation and/or survival of many
cancers even when it is not obviously deregulated [8, 9].
Thus, unlike most targeted therapies, which are typically
directed against specific tumor types harboring diseasespecific mutant forms of driver oncoproteins [10, 11],
Myc represents a more universal target. However, the fact
that Myc is seldom mutated in human cancer, possesses
no readily targetable enzymatic activities and is also

c-Myc (Myc) is among the most frequently deregulated oncoproteins encountered in human cancers and
is a well-studied cause of numerous experimental cancers
[1-3]. As a result, considerable effort has been directed at
identifying small molecule inhibitors of Myc or selective
downstream Myc target gene products that are necessary
to confer or maintain the transformed phenotype [4-7]. The

expressed by normal proliferating cells raises considerable
challenges to the eventual implementation of such specific
therapies without engendering undue toxicities [5-7].
To date, three broad groups of small molecule Myc
inhibitors have been identified which we have previously
classified into “direct”, “indirect” and “synthetic lethal”
categories [5]. Direct inhibitors are represented by
molecules such as 10058-F4, 10074-G5, IIa6B17, JKY-2169 and others which affect the interaction between Myc
and its obligate bHLH-ZIP hetero-dimerization partner
Max [12-17]. In so doing, these inhibitors either prevent
heterodimer formation or alter its conformation in a
manner that renders it incapable of binding its target DNA
[12, 17]. In either case, they interfere with Myc’s role in
activating transcription by promoting acetylation-mediated
chromatin relaxation and RNA Pol II-mediated promoterproximal transcriptional pause release [18-20].
“Indirect” inhibitors, represented by the thienotriazolo-1,4-diazepine JQ1 [21] do not affect MycMax heterodimerization. Rather, they act downstream
of DNA binding by competitively inhibiting binding
of the BET domain protein BRD4 to acetylated lysine
residues of histone H3, thereby attenuating Myc-mediated
transcriptional up-regulation [22-24]. The reduced density
of histone H3 acetylation at intended Myc target genes also
likely serves to reduce the efficiency with which promoter
pause-release factors such as pTEFb and promoter
clearance factors such as TFII-H are recruited to the MycMax transcriptional complex. Because the MYCC gene
is heavily bound by BRD4 at a highly acetylated region
approximately 2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start
site, JQ1 treatment also inhibits Myc transcript and protein
expression in some cell types [22, 23]. The combination of
reduced BRD4 binding at both Myc target genes and the
MYCC gene itself likely accounts for the high specificity
and potency of this compound in some human cancers.
Lastly, synthetic lethal Myc inhibitors also act
indirectly but differ from true indirect inhibitors in that
they selectively promote tumor cell proliferative arrest
and/or apoptosis only when Myc is clearly deregulated and
over-expressed. Included among this group are inhibitors
of GSK3β, which phosphorylates and de-stabilizes Myc
via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [25]. The resultant
pathological accumulation of Myc protein in the face of
these compounds may trigger apoptosis. Other types of
synthetic lethal inhibitors include compounds targeting
CDK1 and Aurora B kinases, which are required for
the proper assembly and function of the mitotic spindle
[26, 27] and derivatives of the anti-malarial compound
artemisinin, which presumably de-stabilize Myc by
increasing rather than inhibiting GSK3β and promoting
more efficient Myc protein degradation in tumors whose
survival is highly Myc-dependent [28]. As a group, these
synthetic lethal inhibitors seem to promote tumor cell
demise either by altering the balance of Myc protein
needed for tumor cell viability or by capitalizing upon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Myc’s tendency to promote aneuploidy [13, 29] by
compromising the transformed cell’s ability to faithfully
partition its abnormal chromosome complement.
In the current work, we have tested representative
compounds from each of these three groups of inhibitors
and show that, despite their widely differing chemical
structures and means of inhibiting Myc, they share a
common core mechanism that involves the depletion of
cellular ATP. Because Myc is needed to sustain glycolysis,
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation
(Oxphos) [30-32], the loss of its function upon inhibitor
treatment leads to a rapid suppression of these energygenerating pathways and terminal differentiation when
this course is an option or apoptotic demise when it is
not. Myc inhibitor-treated cells respond to the loss of
ATP by appropriately activating AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), a serine/threonine kinase that normally
replenishes ATP by promoting glycolysis and Oxphos
[33-35]. However, AMPK activation is ultimately futile
due to the inability of the Myc inhibitor-treated cells to
up-regulate these Myc-dependent processes. Collectively,
these studies underscore the importance of Myc in
maintaining the high anabolic demands of proliferating
tumor cells. Thus, irrespective of their class, Myc
inhibitors ultimately exert a common inhibitory effect on
cancer cells by promoting an irreversible global energy
collapse.

RESULTS
Disparate classes of Myc inhibitors promote HL60
cell cycle arrest and differentiation
For the studies reported here, we selected 9
direct, indirect and synthetic-lethal Myc inhibitors as
representative of their class (Supplementary Figure
1). Within the first class were two previously wellcharacterized compounds, 10058-F4 and 10074-G5 [13,
18, 36, 37], along along with two more potent analogs
of each: 12Rh and 28Rh for 10058-F4 and 3JC-91-2 and
3JC-91-7 for 10074-G5 [12, 15, 38]. Extensive analyses
10058-F4 and 10074-G5 have shown them to bind to
geographically distinct regions of Myc’s intrinsically
disordered monomeric bHLH-ZIP dimerization domain
where they promote a regional conformational distortion
and prevent heterodimerization with Max, Myc’s obligate
bHLH-ZIP partner protein [36, 39-43]. An additional
direct small molecule inhibitor with a mechanism of
action distinct from that of 10058-F4 and 10074-G5
and their analogs was the recently described JKY-2169, a proteomimetic, that was specifically designed to
interact with Myc only in its α−helical conformation that
it assumes upon dimerizing with Max [17, 44]. We have
shown that JKY-2-169 promotes the loss of DNA binding

by perturbing the conformation of Myc-Max heterodimers
without causing their dissociation [17].
Representing the indirect class of inhibitors was
JQ1, which binds to the acetyl lysine recognition domain
of BRD4 [21]. DNA binding by Myc-Max heterodimers
in the nucleus initiates chromatin remodeling by recruiting
a multi-protein complex that includes histone acetylases
such as GCN5 and TIP60 [23]. The subsequent recruitment
of BRD4 to sites of dense histone H3 acetyl lysine content
is necessary to abrogate transcriptional pausing and the
promotion of uni-directional read-through by RNA Pol II.
Lastly, and representative of the synthetic lethal
class of Myc inhibitors, was dihydro artemisinin (DHA),
a common metabolite of the potent anti-malarial drug
artemisinin and its analogs, which has been shown to
selectively promote the proliferative arrest and apoptosis
of Myc over-expressing cells [28, 45]. Although the
precise means by which DHA promotes these phenotypes
remains to be determined, it appears to destabilize Myc
protein by promoting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
degradation [28, 45]. Because many tumors have been
proposed to be dependent upon or “addicted” to high-level
Myc expression [46, 47], its loss may selectively impair
their survival.
Because Myc is necessary to drive the proliferation
of virtually all transformed cells [8, 9, 46], we first
examined the cell cycle effects on the above-described
Myc inhibitors in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells,
which over-express Myc due to gene amplification and
which have been previously used to assess many Myc

inhibitors [12, 15, 38, 48]. As seen in Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure 2, all the above Myc inhibitors
induced a dose-dependent Go/G1 arrest which is a
common response in many cell types depleted of Myc
either pharmacologically or genetically [9, 19, 28]. In
most cases, maximal arrest was observed within 24 hr of
inhibitor addition with longer periods of exposure leading
to apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 3).
Inhibition of Myc in HL60 and other leukemias
promotes differentiation. Moreover, chemically-induced
differentiation by agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide is
typically preceded by a rapid down-regulation of Myc
[23, 28, 49-52]. Moreover, differentiation in these and
many other cell types can be inhibited by the enforced
over-expression of Myc or its v-Myc counterpart [5256]. To determine whether the Go/G1 arrest observed
with Myc inhibitor-treated cells was associated with a
differentiated phenotype, HL60 cells were treated for
5 days with representative inhibitors from each of the
groups and the surviving cells were then assessed for
the expression of differentiation-specific cell surface
markers using fluorescently-tagged mAbs that recognize
the myeloid-specific antigen CD15 and the macrophage/
monocyte antigen CD14 [57]. Control cells were either
left untreated or were exposed to DMSO or the phorbol
ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which
induce myeloid and macrophage/monocyte differentiation,
respectively [58, 59]. As seen in Figure 2, DMSO upregulated CD15 10-fold while only minimally increasing
CD14 expression (approx. 2.5-fold). In contrast, treatment

with TPA led to a concurrent up-regulation of both CD15
(12-fold) and CD14 (24-fold). By way of confirmation,
Wright-Giemsa-stained samples of these same cells
revealed the expected morphological changes associated
with myeloid- and macrophage-specific differentiation
(Supplementary Figure 4). All Myc inhibitors induced
a predominantly myeloid phenotype, although with
some variability. The modest degree of macrophage/
monocyte differentiation observed by flow cytometry
in response to JKY-2-169 (Figure 2) was not apparent
from morphological assessment. Thus, consistent with
previously identified roles for Myc, all three classes
of Myc inhibitors promoted a primarily myeloid
differentiation, as previously described for some of these
agents [28, 60].

the form of ATP [32, 61]. In Myc’s absence, mitochondrial
mass is significantly reduced and the remaining organelles
become atrophic, decrease their rates of Oxphos, display
abnormalities in ETC structure and function and sharply
curtail their production of ATP [31, 32]. For example,
basal ATP levels in myc-/- fibroblasts are only about 20%
those of their myc+/+ counterparts despite the former cells
having slower growth rates and reduced ATP consumption
[32]. Because Myc also regulates glycolysis [30, 32, 62,
63], the profound energy deficit cannot be reversed simply
by up-regulating this pathway. The increased cytoplasmic
accumulation of neutral lipids that has been described
in Myc- and N-Myc depleted cells [61, 64] likely arises
as the result of an increased utilization of fatty acids for
β−oxidation as a way of compensating for the profound
mitochondrial dysfunction [61]. However, because their
rate of uptake exceeds their rate of metabolism, the
excess fatty acids are stored as neutral lipid. We therefore
hypothesized that all Myc inhibitors might ultimately
converge on a common pathway leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction and fatty acid accumulation. To test this, H460
lung cancer cells, which are quite sensitive to Myc levels

[9], were exposed to representative Myc inhibitors for two
days and then stained with the fluorescent, cell-permeable
and neutral lipid-specific dye BODIPY-493/503. Flow
cytometry-based quantification of BODIPY-493/503
uptake indicated that all Myc inhibitors caused significant
increases in the accumulation of neutral lipids although
the magnitude of the change in response to JQ1 and DHA
was low (Figure 3).
To further explore the consequences of Myc
depletion on metabolism, we measured ATP levels in
HL60, H460 and CaLu1 lung cancer cells following
exposure to Myc inhibitors. As seen in Figure 4 for HL60
cells and Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 for H460 and
CaLu1 cells, time-dependent decreases in ATP content
were observed as early as 16 hr after the addition of most
inhibitors and reached their nadir by 24-48 hr. Interestingly,
although both JQ1 and DHA were able to reduce ATP
levels in HL60 and CaLu1 cells (Supplementary Figure
5 and 6), they did so only minimally in H460 cells,
thus suggesting an explanation for the inability of these
inhibitors to promote anything more than only modest
amounts of neutral lipid accumulation (Figure 3).
Indeed, when BODIPY-493/503 staining was repeated
on HL60 cells exposed to these inhibitors, a much more
robust accumulation of neutral lipid was observed that
correlated well with the correspondingly lower ATP
levels (Supplementary Figure 7). These findings are thus
consistent with the idea that ATP depletion, initiated by
Myc inhibitor-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is

ultimately responsible for the accumulation of neutral
lipids [61, 64].
One of the general cellular consequences of an
energy-depleted state, irrespective of its cause, is an
attempt to remedy the deficit by replenishing ATP. The
means by which this is accomplished are intimately
connected and largely mediated by the phosphorylationdependent activation of AMPK [33, 35]. The pleiotropic
consequences of this up-regulation include a marked
reduction in energy-consuming process such as
macromolecular bio-synthesis and cell proliferation and
a stimulation of energy-producing processes such as
glycolysis and Oxphos [33, 34]. To determine whether
Myc inhibitors affected this pathway, we assessed total
and phospho-Thr172-AMPK (pAMPK) in all three cell
types following exposure to members of each of the
three classes of Myc inhibitors. As seen in Figure 5 and
Supplementary Figures 8 and 9, marked phosphorylationdependent AMPK activation was observed in each case
that largely paralleled the previously documented changes
in ATP levels. That AMPK was activated in H460 cells
in response to JQ1 and DHA, despite these compounds
having little effect on cellular ATP or neutral lipid levels
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 5), suggested that
even minor or transient declines in energy levels or
perturbed mitochondrial function might be sufficient to
trigger a response or that phosphorylation of AMPK was
being regulated by factors other than the ATP:AMP ratio
such as ROS that can arise as a result of mitochondrial

Figure 5: Myc inhibitors activate AMPK. Myc inhibitors were added to log-phase HL60 cells for the indicated periods of time. The

cells were then harvested and immuno-blotted for total AMPK or its activated, Thr172-phosphorylated form (pAMPK). See Supplementary

dysfunction [65, 66]. Taken together, these results indicate
that, while AMPK is, to a large degree, appropriately
activated in response to Myc inhibitor-mediated ATP
depletion, it is in most cases unable to restore a normal
energy balance.

ATP depletion alone mimics Myc inhibitor
treatment

JQ1 has been reported to negatively regulate Myc
expression by virtue of the fact that, in at least some cell
types, the MYCC gene’s promoter is a transcriptionally
important site of BRD4 binding to acetylated histones
[22]. In addition, DHA may regulate Myc protein
stability by altering its proteasomal degradation [28]. We
and others have also noticed that cells exposed to other
direct Myc inhibitors for periods of time longer than are
necessary to inhibit Myc activity also demonstrate lowered
Myc protein levels [67, 68 and unpublished observations].
In order to determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction,
ATP depletion and other phenotypes were associated
with reduced Myc expression, we assessed Myc protein
levels by standard immunoblotting at various times after
exposure to the inhibitors. As shown in Figure 6 for
HL60 cells and in Supplementary Figures 10 and 11 for
H460 and CaLu1 lung cancer cells, each of the cell lines
significantly down-regulation of Myc protein within 24-48
hr of the addition of most inhibitors. A notable exception

The foregoing findings suggested that a common
mechanism to explain the effects of structurally
diverse Myc inhibitors on cancer cell survival and/or
differentiation might be their ability to deplete cellular
ATP pools as a consequence of their dual effects on
Myc protein abundance and function and, ultimately, on
glycolysis and Oxphos. To test this directly we depleted
ATP in HL60 cells with two structurally unrelated
inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
(ETC), namely metformin, which inhibits Complex I [6971] and oligomycin A, which inhibits Complex V (ATP
synthase). Although the degree of ATP depletion achieved
was somewhat less than that obtained with most Myc
inhibitors (Figure 7A), robust AMPK activation with still
observed and was associated with cell cycle arrest (Figures
7B and C). Concurrently, HL60 cells acquired a highly

differentiated phenotype in which both CD14 and CD15
were even more highly expressed than in cells treated with
Myc inhibitors, DMSO and TPA (Compare Figure 7D and
Figure 2). Morphological changes were also observed and
were more in keeping with were more in keeping with the
more myelomonocytic form of differentiation induced by
TPA (Figure 2) (Figure 7E). Finally, immunoblots for total
Myc protein showed that unlike DMSO, whose induction
of HL60 differentiation was associated with a nearly
complete disappearance of Myc protein as previously
described [72-75], neither metformin nor oligomycin
caused such a pronounced decline (Figure 7F). From
these studies, we conclude that ATP depletion alone is
sufficient to promote many of the same phenotypes that
are associated with Myc depletion.

association, the distortion of the Myc-Max heterodimer
into a non-DNA binding complex, the interference of MycMax transcriptional regulation by inhibiting BRD4 and
the enhanced proteolysis of the Myc protein itself [12-17,
23, 26-28, 38]. While these distinctions may be useful for
heuristic purposes, they are undoubtedly somewhat oversimplified and their actual mechanisms are likely more
heterogeneous and overlapping. For example, in addition
to preventing BRD4 binding to acetylated histones on
Myc target genes, JQ1 also induces Myc protein loss by
inhibiting transcription of the MYCC gene whose own
promoter also binds BRD4 at a densely acetylated site
[22]. Indeed, the sensitivity of some multiple myelomas
to JQ1 arises in part from a similar loss of Myc expression
in cases where translocated MYCC coding sequences are
juxtaposed to the IgH enhancer, which also binds BRD4
[23]. At this level then, JQ1 functionally resembles certain
synthetic lethal inhibitors such as DHA, which destabilize
Myc post-translationally by increasing its susceptibility
to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [28]. The

accompanies cellular quiescence may be an additional
common feature of all inhibitors.
Irrespective of the means by which the different
classes of Myc inhibitors limit the oncoprotein’s function,
it is clear from the work presented here that they ultimately
converge on a single overriding mechanism that involves
the depletion of cellular energy stores. According to this
model (Figure 8), Myc over-expression by tumor cells is
necessary to maximize glycolysis and Oxphos in order to
support the high level of ATP consumption and biomass
accumulation demanded by rapid, proliferation-associated
anabolism [31, 32]. This coincides with significant
increases in mitochondrial mass (and Oxphos) and explains
how, relative to normal cells, those with de-regulated Myc
can increase ATP turnover without affecting basal levels
[32]. Conversely, Myc’s absence leads to mitochondrial
atrophy, ATP depletion and neutral lipid accumulation
[31, 32, 64]. This latter phenotype has recently been
shown to be due to an increase in fatty acid uptake and
β−oxidation in an attempt to compensate for the impaired
mitochondrial utilization of glucose and glutamine as

energy-generating substrates [61]. An imbalance between
fatty acid uptake and metabolism leads to the former
outpacing the latter with the excess intracellular fatty acid
being directed into neutral lipid stores. Even in the face of
increased β−oxidation, the ATP deficit cannot be corrected
due to the profound mitochondrial dysfunction. The
accumulation of lipid droplets is likely further enhanced
as a result of the reduced need to utilize their stored lipids
and sterols for de novo membrane biogenesis following
Myc depletion and the onset of proliferative arrest (Figure
1 and Supplementary Figure 2) [76-78].
The responses to ATP depletion that ensue as
a result of Myc inhibitor exposure include Go/G1
arrest, which reduces anabolic demand. However, in
appropriate cell types such as HL60 promyelocytes,
terminal differentiation also occurs (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure 4), thus ensuring that cell cycle
arrest remains permanent. AMPK is also activated (Fig. 5
and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9), which, along with Myc
inhibition, likely contributes further to cell cycle arrest
[34]. In Myc-replete cells, the normal response to AMPK

Figure 8: Common mechanism of Myc inhibitor action. By virtue of their ability to prevent DNA binding by Myc-Max

heterodimers and to promote Myc protein loss, Myc inhibitors down-regulate glycolysis and Oxphos [32, 61]. The ensuing depletion of
cellular ATP pools leads to the activation of AMPK, which attempts to replenish ATP levels by down-regulating ATP-consuming processes
such as proliferation and up-regulating ATP-generating processes such as glycolysis and OxPhos. However, because Myc is needed in
concert to facilitate these functions, AMPK’s effect is ultimately abortive and the cell remains chronically ATP-deprived. The lack of
functional Myc also likely affects proliferation and differentiation independent of ATP levels as a result of failure to properly regulate genes
encoding proteins necessary for cell cycle progression such as certain cyclin-dependent kinases and their inhibitors (dotted line) [82].

activation includes increases in glycolysis, mitochondrial
biogenesis and Oxphos [33]. However, because these
processes are highly Myc-dependent [31, 32, 61], they are
impaired if the oncoprotein’s function is disabled either by
genetic or pharmacologic intervention. As a consequence,
ATP levels are unable to normalize, thus likely explaining
the eventual onset of apoptosis. Further supporting this
idea is the finding that, in myc-/- fibroblasts, AMPK is
chronically activated, ATP levels remain at 20% of normal
and the cells show reductions in size, protein content and
proliferation [32, 61].
That ATP depletion alone is sufficient to recapitulate
most of the phenotypes elicited with Myc inhibitors
(Figure 7) further supports the idea that these latter
compounds ultimately serve to inhibit tumor growth by
depleting cellular energy stores. However, Myc is wellknown to control many genes involved in cell cycle
progression and survival that operate through pathways
quite distinct from those controlling metabolism [79-82].
Thus, Myc’s effect on ATP levels likely provides only a
partial explanation of how it regulates overall tumor cell
fitness (Figure 8).
Collectively, our findings provide an empirical
foundation upon which to suggest that maximal benefit
from the clinical implementation of Myc inhibitors,
regardless of their class, may derive from their combined
use with agents that act to further compromise cellular
energy supplies.

directions of the supplier. Two color flow cytometry was
performed on BD FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer and
analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences)
and Flowing Software 2.5.1 (www.flowingsoftware.com).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Neutral lipid measurements

Cell lines

Cells were seeded into 6 well plastic tissue culture
plates (2 x 105 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight.
Fresh medium containing the indicated concentration of
Myc inhibitor was then added and the incubation was
continued for an additional 2-3 days. Cells were then
trypsinized, washed in PBS and then stained in suspension
with BODIPY-493/503 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
(2 µg/ml for 30 min). BODIPY-493/503 uptake was then
assessed by flow cytometry using Cell Quest Pro software.

HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, human
H460 large cell undifferentiated lung cancer cells and
human CaLu1 non-small cell lung cancer cells were
cultured as previously described [12, 38]. Briefly, HL60
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium and H460
and CaLu1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s minimal essential medium (D-MEM). Both sets
of media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml Penicillin G and
100 µg/ml streptomycin. All reagents were obtained from
Atlanta Biologicals (Flowery Branch, GA).

ATP assays
Cells in 6-well plates were treated with Myc
inhibitors for the indicated periods of time. The cells
were then counted and lysed in 96 well plates. ATP
determinations were performed using the ATP Lite ATP
detection system (Perkin-Elmer, Inc. Downers Grove, IL)
according to the directions of the supplier. Each point was
assayed in quadruplicate and mean values +/- 1 standard
error determined. ATP luminescence was normalized to
the total number of cells used per assay and presented
as a relative value compared with non-treated control.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad

Cell cycle analysis
Sub-confluent cultures of cells at >90% viability
were plated into fresh medium at densities that were
typically about 10% of those attained at the point of
density arrest. The next day, Myc inhibitors at the stated
concentrations were added for 24-48 hr. The cells were
then harvested, washed twice in PBS and stained with
propidium iodide as previously described [29, 83]. Cell

Cells were exposed to Myc inhibitors for the
indicated periods of time and then harvested and lysed
in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Equivalent amounts of protein were subjected
to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting according to
previously-described procedures [12, 13]. Antibodies
used included mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
against AMPK (1:1000 dilution: catalog no. 2532, Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and Myc (1:500
dilution: Clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Santa Cruz, CA) a rabbit polyclonal antibody against
AMPK phospho-Thr172 (1:1000 dilution, catalog no.
2535, Cell Signaling Technologies). As a control for
protein loading, blots were also probed with a mouse
mAb against β−actin (1:10,000 dilution: cat. no.3700S
Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoblots were developed
using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent according
to the directions of the supplier (SuperSignal West Femto
Maxmum Sensitivity Substrate, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Inc. Waltham, MA).
