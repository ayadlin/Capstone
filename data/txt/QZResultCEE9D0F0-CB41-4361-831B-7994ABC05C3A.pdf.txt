BACKGROUND: A pathologic complete response (pCR) and minimal residual disease (pMRD) after preoperative
chemotherapy (PCT) for early stage or locally advanced breast cancer (BC) correlates with a good prognosis. METHODS: Patients who received from 6 to 8 cycles of PCT for BC were monitored by 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET), and the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated
at baseline, after 2 cycles, after 4 cycles, and at the end of PCT. SUVmax percentage changes (D-SUV) were compared with the pathologic response rate. Patients who had a pCR or pMRD in the tumor and an absence of cancer
cells in ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes were defined as having obtained an optimal pathologic response (pR),
whereas all the other conditions were classified as a pathologic nonresponse (pNR). RESULTS: Of 34 patients, 7
(21%) achieved a pR (3 patients had a pCR, and 4 patients had pMRD). After the second cycle, the D-SUV threshold
with optimal negative predictive value to predict a pR was 50%. Twenty-six patients (76%) had a D-SUV >50%,
including all 7 patients who had a pR and 19 patients who had a pNR. Conversely, all 8 patients who had a D-SUV
50% had a pNR. All 8 of those patients had estrogen recepetor-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Early evaluation of
metabolic response by 18F-FDG-PET during PCT was able to identify 30% of patients, all with estrogen receptor-posiC 2010
tive tumors, who would not obtain pR after completion of chemotherapy program. Cancer 2010;116:805–13. V

Preoperative chemotherapy (PCT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and is an optional
treatment modality for women who would prefer conservative surgery when it is not immediately achievable. Indeed, in
the majority of patients, PCT can induce a reduction in the tumor volume that makes conservative surgery feasible. Currently, the achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR) has emerged as the primary endpoint of PCT in patients
who have operable breast cancer. In fact, a pCR is associated with a favorable prognosis, because patients who achieve a
pCR have a far lower risk of subsequent recurrence and a better overall survival than patients who have residual invasive tumor at the time of surgery.1-3 These results support pCR after PCT as a prognostic factor and as a potentially useful shortterm endpoint for testing new therapies.4 However, application of the pCR definition across clinical trials of PCT is not
uniform. The current consensus is that the preferred definition of pCR is the absence of both residual invasive cancer
within the breast and in the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes.5 Because the presence of residual disease after neoadjuvant
treatment includes a broad range of actual responses, from a near pCR to frank disease resistance, a composite index of the
residual cancer burden after PCT recently was proposed.6 Patients with minimal residual disease had the same 5-year

prognosis as those with pCR irrespective of the type of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered, whether they
received adjuvant hormone therapy, or the pathologic residual disease stage. Therefore, the combination of pCR
and minimal residual disease expands the subset of
patients who can benefit substantially from PCT.
The availability of an early predictive test of the
pathologic response to PCT could allow for the better tailoring of individual patient treatment, including treatment interruption if there is limited activity. In this
instance, stopping treatment also could avoid unwarranted side-effects. Because the standard duration of PCT
varies between 4 and 8 cycles, the optimal timing to
obtain a response prediction appears to be after the early
cycles, at a stage when changing the treatment strategy is
still a viable and reasonable option. Until now, early
changes at physical examination and breast imaging7,8
have exhibited a low correlation with the ultimate pathologic assessment of residual disease and are not considered
useful in predicting pathologic response in clinical
practice.
Over the last few years, is has been reported that
18
F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is capable of predicting the
pathologic response at an early stage during PCT for early
stage and locally advanced breast cancer9-15 by virtue of
the precocious changes in tumor metabolism that can be
demonstrated by FDG-PET. However, the heterogeneity
of methodologies and, to some extent, the findings across
the studies currently make the role of early FDG-PET
evaluation in clinical practice unclear.
In the current study, we investigated the value of
FDG-PET scan monitoring to predict the pathologic
response after PCT, and we paid particular attention to
the optimal timing of early evaluation and its correlation
with the standard biopathologic tumor profile. This study
is a part of a broader study project on PCT for early or
locally advanced breast cancer that started at our institution in 2004 (the Arianna 1 Project).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed early and
locally advanced breast cancer (tumor [T] classification
T2-T4, lymph node [N] classification N0-N3, and metastasis [M] classification M0 according to the International
Union Against Cancer TNM classification16) and who
had adequate medical status for chemotherapy and breast

surgery were eligible for the study. Patients who had M1
oligometastatic breast cancer also were eligible provided
that the therapeutic program included breast surgery postchemotherapy. The histologic diagnosis of breast cancer
was confirmed by core-needle biopsy. Physical examination, mammography, breast ultrasound, breast magnetic
resonance imaging, chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans, bone scans, and FDG-PET/CT studies
were obtained at baseline in all patients. Physical examination, mammography, breast ultrasound, breast magnetic
resonance imaging, and 18F-FDG-PET/CT studies were
repeated every other cycle and before surgery. Written
informed consent was provided by all patients, and the
study was approved by the local ethics committee.
Treatment
Patients received from 6 to 8 cycles of anthracyclinebased and taxane-based PCT every 21 days. Surgery
(including axillary lymph node dissection) was undergone
after patients completed PCT and consisted of a conservative procedure whenever possible. Patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery subsequently received
radiotherapy.
Pathologic Assessment
Fresh surgical specimens (breast and axillary lymph
nodes) obtained postchemotherapy were evaluated by an
experienced breast pathologist (D.S.). The surgically
removed specimen was thinly sliced and fixed immediately in neutral buffered formalin. If the tumor was
detected macroscopically, then its size was measured; if no
macroscopic lesion was identified, t hen wide slides of all
breast tissue were sampled guided by radiographic images
of the specimen, according to Proceedings of the 2003
Consensus Conference on Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in
Carcinoma of the Breast held in Philadelphia.17 The
whole tumor area or ‘‘tumor bed’’ was taken for histologic
examination. Handling sections were fixed according to
standard procedures in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Then, 5-lm-thick sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. The histologic response to chemotherapy was
assessed by the same pathologist using a grading system
according to the Miller-Payne classification described by
Smith et al. and Ogston et al.3,18 This grading system
assesses the degree of reduction in tumor cellularity
obtained by comparing the tumor cellularity a pretreatment core biopsy with the tumor cellularity observed in
the residual breast tumor tissue removed at surgery. The

tumors were graded on a scale from 1 to 5 as follows: tumor regression grade (TRG) 1, no response to treatment;
TRG 2, <30% reduction in cellularity; TRG 3, from
30% to 90% reduction in cellularity; TRG 4, >90% and
<100% reduction in cellularity; and TRG 5, a complete
response with no residual tumor. Histologic grading of
the pathologic response also was evaluated concomitantly
on the axillary lymph nodes as the lymph node regression
grade (NRG). In particular, axillary lymph node status
(ALN) was classified according to a 4-grade scale as follows: A, true ALN negative; B, ALN positive, no therapeutic response; C, ALN positive, evidence of a partial
pathologic response; and D, ALN previously positive but
converted to lymph node negative after chemotherapy.
TRG and NRG served as the reference standards for the
evaluation of treatment response with FDG-PET. Two
regression groups based on pathologic response were
defined: optimal responders (TRG 4 and 5 with NRG A
and D) and nonresponders (TRG 1, 2, and 3 with no
NRG).
PET Imaging
18
F-FDG-PET/CT studies were repeated after each PCT
cycle in the first 10 patients. From those preliminary data,
we observed that the main metabolic changes in tumor
localization occurred after the second course of PCT19;
therefore, subsequent patients underwent PET/CT scans
at baseline, after the second and fourth cycles of PCT, and
at the end of all PCT treatment, before surgery.
18
F-FDG was produced in the local radiopharmacy
by using standardized synthesis techniques. All imaging
studies were obtained with a hybrid PET/CT scanner
(Discovery LS; GE Medical System, Waukesha, Wis).
18
F-FDG-PET/CT studies were obtained according to
standard procedure.20 The patients fasted for at least 6
hours, and glycemia levels were monitored in patients
with diabetes. Patients received an intravenous injection
of 18F-FDG 5.3 megabecquerels per kilogram (MBq/Kg),
and imaging acquisition started from 60 to 70 minutes after the radiotracer injection. Patients were asked to urinate
immediately before image acquisition to minimize bladder activity.
18
F-FDG-PET/CT emission data were acquired for
4 minutes per bed position; then, 35 images were reconstructed after a correction for CT data nonuniform
attenuation. The CT parameters were 120 kV, 60 mA,
0.8 seconds per tube rotation, and 30-mm bed speed per
gantry rotation (multislice technology enabled the acquisition of slices from 4 mm to 5 mm thick per tube rota-

tion). Thus, we demonstrated that CT does not release a
high radiation dose to the patient but still is efficient for
distinguishing different tissues with good spatial resolution. CT images subsequently were merged with PET/CT
images to obtain an accurate localization of 18F-FDGPET/CT findings.
The PET/CT scan was read by 2 nuclear medicine
physicians, and the report was written by consensus: Any
area of increased 18F-FDG uptake was taken into account
for evaluation. The metabolic activity of each pathologic
lesion was measured using the maximum standardized
uptake value (SUVmax) method. The SUVmax was calculated on the basis of the following formula: tissue concentration (MBq/g)/injected dose (MBq)/body weight
(g). The SUVmax was measured at the breast tumor and
at the ipsilateral axilla level before and during treatment.
The SUVmax from PET/CT scans obtained after
the second, fourth, sixth, or eighth courses of CT were
compared with the SUVmax from PET/CT scan obtained
at baseline, which was considered as the reference value, to
obtain the percentage reduction in SUVmax (D-SUV). A
PET/CT metabolic response was considered complete
when tumor SUVmax during treatment became equal to
the normal surrounding tissue uptake (usually values <2).
Statistical Analysis
To identify an optimal threshold value of D-SUV capable
of separating patients who had an optimal pathologic
response (pR) and patients who had a pathologic nonresponse (pNR), a receiver operating characteristic analysis
was performed after 2 cycles of PTC using STATA software (version 9; StataCorp, Chicago, Ill). The area under
the curve with 95% confidence interval, standard error,
sensitivities, and specificities were assessed. The test was
considered positive when the D-SUV value was greater
than the cutoff value, and vice versa. Statistical analyses
were performed by running SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Cary, NC) on a PC. Two-tailed P values
<.05 were considered statistically significant.

PCT consisted of anthracycline-based and taxanebased regimens for 6 cycles in 8 patients and anthracycline-based and taxane-based, sequential 4-cycle regimens
for a total of 8 cycles in 26 patients. All but 2 patients
underwent surgery at a median interval of 24 days (range,
11-52 days) between the last cycle of chemotherapy and
surgery. Intervention consisted of conservative surgery in
19 patients and mastectomy in 13 patients. One patient
underwent simultaneous mastectomy and wedge resection
of 3 liver metastases.
Pathologic responses after the completion of chemotherapy are reported in Table 2. Five patients were not
evaluable: Three 3 of those 5 patients chose to undergo
surgery at another hospital; however, from a review of
their surgical specimens by our pathologist, they were classified as nonresponders. Two of those 5 patients did not
undergo surgery because of the persistence of over-large
local disease extension; however, they did undergo a new
breast core-needle biopsy and were classified as nonresponders. Overall, 3 patients (9%) had a pCR and 4
patients (12%) had pathologic minimal residual disease;
thus. an overall pR was observed in 7 patients (21%), and
a pNR was observed in 27 patients (79%). It should be
noted that the patient who had liver metastases had TRG
5 both in the breast lesion and in the liver lesions.

The D-SUV after 2 cycles, after 4 cycles, and before surgery is detailed for individual patients in Table 3. All but
1 patient presented with a reduction in SUVmax after 2
cycles. The median D-SUV after 2 cycles, 4 cycles, and 6

the difference did not reach statistical significance.

sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV). The highest NPV was obtained with a 50% D-SUV decrease
threshold. All 7 patients who had a pR had D-SUV values
>50%, and all 8 patients who had D-SUV values 50%
had a pNR, as illustrated in Figure 2. At this cutoff level,
the sensitivity, specificity, and NPV of the D-SUV after 2
cycles were 100%, 30%, and 100%, respectively. Of 27
patients who had a pNR, 8 patients (30%) were identified
correctly by a 50% D-SUV threshold. In 6 of those 8
patients, the pNR was represented by poor reduction in
tumor cellularity (TRG 1 or 2). Although no changes
occurred at a 45% threshold, lower values of sensitivity,
specificity, and NPV were obtained at a 55% threshold
(Table 4). By increasing the number of cycles, sensitivity

810

and the NPV with a 50% threshold remained the same,
whereas specificity decreased (Table 5). FDG-PET accuracy turned out to be scarce at any time during monitoring
because of the very low specificity as a result of the high
number of false-positive findings.
The analysis of the relation between the pathologic
and metabolic response after 2 cycles of PCT according to
estrogen receptor (ER) status and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is reported in Table 6. All 8 patients who had D-SUV values 50% (true
nonresponders) had ER-positive tumors, representing the
40% of this patient class (8 of 20 patients). None of the
13 patients who had ER-negative tumors had D-SUV values 50%. At the same time, 6 of 7 true nonresponders
had HER2-negative tumors. Overall, FDG-PET monitoring predicted that 6 of 16 individual patients (37.5%)
who had ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors would
obtain a pNR.

cancer during PCT have evidenced a correlation between
early changes in the SUVmax and the pathologic
response; however, the role of this kind of monitoring in
clinical practice remains unclear because of the substantial
heterogeneity of the results. Some important issues underlying the heterogeneity across studies are the definition of
pathologic response, the timing of early FDG-PET evaluation, and the choice of the D-SUV threshold to separate
responsive and nonresponsive patients.
The definition of a histopathologic response differs
across studies9,10,12,13 or is lacking completely14: either information on the concomitant pathologic status of axillary
lymph nodes is not reported10,12,15 or, ultimately, patients
who obtain a suboptimal pathologic response are included
in the group of responsive patients.12 Consequently, the
incidence of patients who are considered optimal pathologic responders has wide variability (range, 17%15 to
47%).12 We used the Miller-Payne grading system
because it is considered the most complete classification:
It grades pathologic remission in both the primary tumor
and the axillary lymph nodes by comparing negative
lymph nodes with those that already have responded to
chemotherapy,19 and it restricts the definition of an optimal pathologic response (pR) only to those patients whose
tumors had a very high response (ie, a reduction in cellularity >90%) with the concomitant absence of tumor cells
in the axillary lymph nodes. Patients with all other conditions were considered to have obtained a pNR. By using
this grading system, our pR rate was 21%.
Various investigators have reported the results of
PET monitoring after the first cycle,13 after the first and
second cycles,10,15 or at various subsequent time points
during PCT in addition to the first and second
cycles.10,12,13 There does not appear to be a consensus
regarding the optimal timing of early PET evaluation.
The changes in SUV occur rapidly during the first part of

treatment; and, even if the decrease in SUVmax continues
up to the end of chemotherapy, the curve tends to flatten
out (Fig. 1). In our study, the SUVmax curves declined in
responsive and nonresponsive patients and tended to
diverge over the whole PTC treatment: The mean differences were 7% after 2 cycles and 20% by the end of treatment. From Figure 1, we can observe that the difference
between the 2 curves after the first cycle was lower than after 2 cycles. McDermott et al.13 have suggested that the
best time to monitor chemotherapy response is most likely
between the end of the first cycle and the chemotherapy
midpoint. Bearing in mind the need to look for indications that may be helpful in the decision-making process,
based on our results, we suggest that the best timing to
perform the early evaluation of response by FDG-PET is
immediately before the third cycle.
A critical point concerns the choice of the D-SUV
cutoff value to identify patients who will attain a pR and
those who will not reach this result. In the clinical setting
of primary systemic treatment for surgically operable early
breast cancer, a reliable test to identify the individual
patients who will not respond optimally after 2 cycles
would allow us to bring forward the surgical procedure or
to change the medical treatment schedule, ie, change over
to a different chemotherapy regimen or move on to the
other chemotherapy regimen directly when the sequential
2-regimen PCT program had been planned. Conversely,
when the clinical setting is characterized by locally
advanced breast cancer, the same early information could
make a change in the strategy a feasible option, even if it
most likely has a more limited clinical bearing and prognostic significance. Hence, the capacity of early FDGPET to identify individual patients who will not respond
optimally is more interesting for clinical practice. Consequently, the NPV, rather than the overall accuracy of the
test, has major relevance in the analysis of the results. The

811

Original Article

D-SUV cutoff value after 2 cycles should have a very high
NPV, possibly 100%. In the study by Rousseau et al.,12
the highest NPV (85%) was obtained with a 40% D-SUV
threshold after 2 cycles. This result appears to have limited
clinical application because of the relatively high proportion of false-negative findings, most likely because those
investigators included patients who had a suboptimal
pathologic response in the group of responders. SchwarzDose et al.,15 using a definition of optimal pathologic
response according to Honkoop et al.,21 obtained a 96%
NPV with a 45% cutoff value in a multicenter study that
included 64 patients who underwent FDG-PET monitoring after 2 cycles. This corresponds to 1 false-negative
patient in 23 negative patients. These results are very close
to those observed in our study, in which an NPV of 100%
was obtained with a D-SUV threshold of 50%.
In the current study, PET early identified 8 of 27
individual patients (30%) who would not achieve a pR.
This corresponds to 23.5% of the whole series of enrolled
patients. This percentage appears to be too low to recommend the introduction of FDG-PET in the standard baseline workup and monitoring of PTC for patients with
early or locally advanced breast cancer. However, in our
analysis according to biologic tumor characterization, the
early identification of nonresponders was set aside exclusively for patients who had ER-positive tumors and for
those who had ER-positive/HER2 negative tumors when
both parameters were available. In particular, early PET
evaluation predicts pNR in 40% ER-positive tumors. In
previous reports on the role of early PET evaluation during PCT, an analysis of the correlation between biologic
characteristics of individual tumors and the D-SUV was
lacking. Our results are in keeping with the well known
lower chemosensitivity of ER-positive tumors compared
with ER-negative tumors in the preoperative setting.22,23
In addition, the subgroup of ER-positive/HER2-negative
tumors is biologically heterogeneous, because these
tumors generally are both responsive to hormone manipulations to various degrees and variously responsive to
chemotherapy, including poor sensitivity and resistance
to cytotoxic agents.
Potential drawbacks for the generalization of our
observations include the variability of PET/CT technology in current international clinical practice and the consequent possible differences in SUV values from center to
center. It is well known that many factors may influence
the SUV calculation. Several reports indicate that injection accuracy,24 uptake time, fasting period, and glucose
levels25 affect SUV values. However, the influence of these

812

factors can be minimized by standardizing the methodological approach as much as possible.26 SUV calculations
also may depend on other factors, such as the type of tomography, the acquisition, and the reconstruction parameters.27 This finding implies that there is significant
variability in SUV values across centers; and, finally, it
prevents the possibility of deriving an absolute SUV cutoff
value from 1 institution to another. Therefore, only SUV
changes expressed as percentage modifications (D-SUV)
can be considered, because the exact same protocol is used
to calculate those values.
The chief weakness of the current study is the small
number of patients studied. For this reason, the results
(and, in particular, the identification by FDG-PET monitoring of individual patients with ER-positive tumors and
possible ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors who will not
obtain a pR with PCT) must be confirmed. A much larger
study will be necessary to determine whether PET/CT has
any role to play in the early detection of nonresponders.
For PET/CT to have value, it must reliably identify these
patients in a prospective manner so that therapeutic intervention may be redirected thoughtfully. Consequently,
our findings are to be considered only as a proposal that
will require confirmation.
In conclusion, the current study confirmed that the
early evaluation of metabolic response by FDG-PET
monitoring during PCT for breast cancer correlates with
the pathologic response documented at the time of surgery. However, such evaluation does not appear to be useful in selectively identifying those patients who will
achieve an optimal pathologic response (pCR or pMRD)
because of the high number of false-positive results. Conversely, FDG-PET individually was able to identify 30%
of patients who would not have an optimal pathologic
response. It is noteworthy that this predictive power is
limited only to ER-positive tumors, an observation that
warrants further study in a larger patient series. If these
findings are confirmed, then FDG-PET performed at
baseline and after 2 cycles of PCT could supply important
information to be used in the decision-making process.
