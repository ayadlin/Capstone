ABSTRACT:
Sorafenib (Nexavar), a multiple kinase inhibitor, is the only clinically approved
drug for patients with advanced HCC. However, its therapeutic success is limited by
the emergence of drug resistance. Here we found that p21 and pGSK3βSer9 are major
players in the resistance to sorafenib. We recently reported that aberrant Notch3
expression in HCC contributes to doxorubicin resistance in vitro and, therefore, we
focused on the mechanisms that associate Notch3 to acquired drug resistance. In
this study we first found that Notch3 inhibition significantly increased the apoptosis
inducing effect of sorafenib in HCC cells via specific down-regulation of p21 and
up-regulation of pGSK3βSer9. Using a mouse xenograft model we further found that
Notch3 depletion combined with 21 days of sorafenib treatment exerts a substantial
antitumor effect in vivo. Interestingly, we showed that, upon exposure to sorafenib
treatment, Notch3 depleted xenografts maintain lower levels of p21 and higher levels
of pGSK3βSer9 than control xenografts. Thus, this study demonstrated that inhibition
of Notch3 signaling prevents HCC-mediate drug resistance and sensitizes HCC cells
to sorafenib. Finally, we validated our in vitro and in vivo results in primary human
HCCs showing that Notch3 protein expression positively correlated with p21 protein
expression and negatively correlated with pGSK3βSer9 expression. In conclusion, the
results presented in this study demonstrated that Notch3 silencing enhances the
effect of sorafenib by overcoming drug resistance. Notch3 inhibition in combination
with sorafenib can be a promising strategy for treatment of HCC.

INTRODUCTION

cannot be selective for neoplastic cells and, given the
central importance of this organ, liver failure is a deadly
complication of HCC therapy. The recent introduction of
molecularly targeted drugs has opened a new scenario for
HCC treatment. In particular, sorafenib, a multi-kinase
inhibitor mainly acting on vascular cells, was shown to
significantly improve survival in patients with advanced
HCC (SHARP and ASAP), even though prognosis still
remained dismal with mean survival rates assessing
at 10 and 6.2 months in the different settings (contr

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly
malignant liver tumor that most often arises in
cirrhotic livers and is quite unrensponsive to common
chemotherapeutic agents. In liver cirrhosis, which is
today considered a premalignant condition, it is often
possible to observe early signs of derangement in the same
proliferative and apoptotic pathways driving the growth
of HCC cells. Therefore, chemotherapeutic strategies

sharp and asap) [1, 2]. Thus the exploration of possible
combinations between targeted drugs whose effects are
addictive or synergic, raises the possibility to find effective
combinations with low toxicity. Accordingly, molecules
expressed in HCC tissue and not in cirrhosis represent
targets of considerable interest to preserve non neoplastic
tissue and reduce side effects. The Notch3 receptor is
aberrantly expressed in nearly 80% of HCCs with a
negligible expression in normal liver as well as in cirrhotic
tissue surrounding HCC [3]. Given the fundamental
roles played by Notch in cell fate during embryonic
development, it is not a surprise that alterations in Notch
signaling have been associated with tumor development
[4]. Inhibition of Notch expression by antisense retrovirus
or pharmacologic blocking of γ-secretase activity has
shown striking antineoplastic effects in Notch-expressing
transformed cells in vitro and in xenograft models [5,
6]. Recently, we showed that Notch3 depleted HCC
cells have the same rate of apopotosis of control cells.
However, Notch3 silencing in liver cancer cells was able
to strongly enhance the therapeutic effects of doxorubicin
by up-regulating p53-dependent apoptosis [7]. With
regard to HCC resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, we
hypothesized that Notch3 may function as a positive factor
for multi-drug resistance. Indeed there is evidence that
Notch3 over-expression confers resistance to carboplatin
and is related to the recurrence of ovarian cancer [8].
The main purposes of the present study are to assess
whether Notch3 inhibition enhances sorafenib effects in
HCC and to individuate which molecular pathways are
interacting in their therapeutic effects.
We showed that the specific block of Notch3
signaling with shRNA enhanced sensitivity to sorafenib in
vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that Notch3 inhibition
holds promise as an additional strategy to improve
molecular cancer therapy, in particular when resistance to
and/or escape from existing therapies evolve.

found that sorafenib treatment in Notch3 KD cells resulted
in an increase of Caspase-8, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3
cleavage in conjunction with enhance Annexin V-FITC
intensity (Fig.1C and 1E) but LDH was not increased
in the medium when compared to GL2 cells (Suppl. Fig
1C). Taken together these results indicate that sorafenib
treated Notch3 KD cells die because of apoptosis. Next
we better examined the contributions of either apoptotic
pathways for sorafenib induced apoptosis using Caspase-8
and Caspase-9 selective inhibitors (Fig. 1D). Annexin
V-FITC staining showed a reduction in apoptosis in
cells treated with caspase 8 inhibitor both in GL2 and in
Notch3 depleted cells whereas caspase 9 inhibitor affects
apoptosis only in Notch3 silenced cells (Fig. 1E) in line
with the high levels of p53 (Fig. 1A) [7]. Taken together
our data show that in Notch3 depleted cells sorafenib
activates both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Effects of Notch3 depletion and sorafenib
treatment on in vivo tumor growth and
angiogenesis.
Targeting tumor vasculature as a cancer therapy
is an established concept to benefit patients with a wide
variety of tumor types because tumor angiogenesis implies
a rapidly growing tumor.
In addition to targeting Raf serine /threonine kinases
sorafenib inhibits several RTKs known to promote
angiogenesis, as VEGFR2, in human endothelial cells [11].
Interestingly, both VEGFR2 and CD31, a transmembrane
molecule expressed on endothelial cells, have been shown
to transduce signals that mediate angiogenesis, vascular
remodelling and cellular proliferation and their expression
correlates with prognosis in HCC [12]. Our experiments
showed that the treatment with sorafenib (60 mg/kg/d)
for 21 days inhibited tumour growth significantly more in
both Huh7 (p=0.04) and HepG2 (p=0.01) Notch3 depleted
xenografts than in GL2 xenografts. (Fig.2A). Indeed, after
21 days of sorafenib exposure Notch3 depleted xenografts
showed a much lower proliferation and vessel density than
Notch3 undepleted ones, as shown by immuno-staining for
Ki67, VEGFR2 and CD31 (Fig.2B-E).

RESULTS
Notch3 KD enhances apoptosis of Sorafenib
treated HCC cells.

Notch3 and Sorafenib share common pathways

Sorafenib was approved for HCC therapy in 2007
and represents the standard of care for patients with
advanced-stage disease [9]. Sorafenib slows tumor growth
by blocking different signaling pathways involved in cell
proliferation [10] and angiogenesis.
We initially explored the effects of Notch3 ablation
(Fig. 1A) on sorafenib activity in the two HCC cell
lines used in this study. Trypan dye uptake in multiple
experiments revealed that after 72 h of sorafenib exposure
the mortality due to Notch3 KD increased by 3,8 and 5
fold in HepG2 and Huh7 cells respectively (Fig.1B). We

To better investigate the mechanisms associated with
the enhanced sorafenib sensitivity observed in Notch3
depleted cells, we first examined the phosphorylation
status of well established targets of sorafenib such as
ERK1/2 and Akt [13] in Notch3 KD cells. As shown in
Figures 3A & 3B, GL2 and Notch3 KD cells had very
similar expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt in either
untreated or sorafenib treated cells, suggesting that these
molecules are not associated with the response to sorafenib
in Notch3 KD cells. We next examined GSK3β, a kinase

status (pGSK3βSer9). We found that pGSK3βSer9 was
markedly increased in Notch3 KD cells compared with

GL2 cells (Fig.3A) and that the high pGSK3βSer9 levels
were maintained in response to sorafenib exposure
(Fig.3B).

Finally, we examined whether sorafenib treatment
modifies the expression of two proteins regulated by

Notch3, p21 and p53, known to affect the responsiveness
to chemotherapeutics drugs [7, 14]. Supplemental Figure

p21 mRNA expression but an increased expression of p53
mRNA (Suppl. Fig.2B). Interestingly, Notch3 depleted
cells retain lower levels of p21 and the same levels of p53
then GL2 cells after exposure to sorafenib (Suppl. Fig.2C).

not the only reason for the enhanced sorafenib sensitivity
following Notch3 depletion. In addition to transcriptional
regulation by both p53 and Hes1 proteins, p21 functions
can be regulated at post-translational level by GSK3β [15].
However, the lower levels of p21 observed in sorafenib
treated HepG2 and Huh7 were not dependent by GSK3β.
Indeed GSK3β silencing did not down-regulate p21
protein expression (Fig.3D) suggesting that the effect
of sorafenib in p21 depleted cells was independent of
GSK3β.

P21 down-regulation contributes to sorafenibinduced cell death in HCC cells.
To determine if lower p21 levels were functionally
associated with the enhanced sorafenib sensitivity
shown by Notch3 KD cells, we ablated endogenous p21
expression by transient siRNA transfection (Fig.4A).
Transfected cells were treated with 4 uM sorafenib for 48
h and 72 h. p21 knockdown increased apoptosis induced
by sorafenib as revealed by trypan blue uptake in three
independent experiments and by increased levels of
cleaved caspase 3 (Fig.4B-C). From the data it appears,
that sorafenib treatment was more effective in Notch3 KD
cells than in p21 silenced cells, suggesting that p21 was

endogenous levels of both p21 and GSK3β by transient

for 72 h. Down regulation of both p21 and GSK3β resulted
in enhanced cell death as revealed by trypan blue uptake
in three independent experiments (Fig.4E). Cell death
upon sorafenib exposure increased 3.85 fold in cells
silenced for both p21 and GSK3β compared to negative
control (Fig.4E) (p<0.001). Considering that Notch3
depletion alone enhances sorafenib sensitivity 3.8 fold in
HepG2 cells (Fig.1B), it seems that p21 and pGSK3βSer9
expression are the main reasons for the increased sorafenib
sensitivity of Notch3 silenced cells in vitro.

To determine if lower p53 levels observed in
sorafenib treated HepG2 and Huh7 cells were functionally
associated with drug sensitivity, we ablated endogenous
p53 expression by transient siRNA transfection (Suppl.
Fig.3A). Transfected cells were treated with sorafenib for
48 h and 72 h. Down-regulation of p53 reduced cellular
death of both HepG2 and Huh7 only after 48 h of sorafenib

exposure, as revealed by trypan blue uptake. After 72 h of
treatment with sorafenib no difference were observed in
cell death between control and p53 silenced cells (Suppl.
Fig.3B) probably because sorafenib treatment downregulates p53 (Suppl. Fig.2B) causing the same effect
of p53 silencing. Our findings are in line with a recent
study showing that the sensitization effect of sorafenib on
cisplatin can be mediated via both p53-dependent andindependent mechanisms [16].These results strengthen the
above observation indicating that p21 and pGSK3βSer9 are
the major effectors of the enhanced sorafenib sensitivity of
Notch3 depleted HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

pGSK3βSer9, p21 and p53 protein levels (Fig.5A-C).
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed similar
results for p21 gene transcription (Fig.5D). These results
lets us to hypothesize that ERK1/ 2 mediate p21 downregulation via p53. However, sorafenib treatment of
ERK1/2 silenced cells resulted in increased pGSK3βSer9
(Fig. 5E) suggesting that sorafenib regulates GSK3β
phosphorylation through mechanisms independent of
ERK1/2. Accordingly, pGSK3βSer9 was up-regulated
in both untreated and sorafenib treated Notch3 KD
cells although pERK1/2 protein levels were unchanged
(Fig.3A-B). To further investigate the mechanism involved
in GSK3β phosphorylation, HepG2 Notch3 silenced
cells were treated with a phosphate inhibitor (Okadaic
acid) ore with a kinase inhibitor (GDC-0941) alone or
in combination with sorafenib. Phosphatase inhibition
resulted in the same increase in pGSK3βSer9 observed in
sorafenib treated cells. Interestingly combined treatment
has the same effect on GSK3β phosphorylation than single
compounds suggesting that this phenomenon is due to
phosphatase inactivation by sorafenib (Fig. 5F). Moreover,
in agreement with this observation, kinase inhibitor GDC0941, alone or in combination with sorafenib, reduces the
levels of pGSK3βSer9 compared to sorafenib treated cells
(Fig. 5G).

Sorafenib regulates p21 and pGSK3βSer9through
ERK dependent and independent mechanisms.
ERK proteins associates with and phosphorylates
different proteins including GSK3β and p21 resulting
respectively in their inactivation or degradation [17,
18]. In addition ERK1/2 act as activators of p53 and
consequent cellular response [19]. To analyze if ERK1/2
are responsible for the alterations observed in the levels of
p21 and pGSK3βser9 following exposure to sorafenib, their
expression was assessed in ERK1/2 silenced cells.
ERK1/2 silencing resulted in decreased

Liver tumor cells confere resistance to sorafenib
through pERK1/2 and p21 up-regulation and
pGSK3βSer9 downregulation.

Notch3 KD cells, we examined their expression in tumor
xenografts after sorafenib treatment. We found that
Notch3 KD tumors had significant lower levels of p21 and
increased levels of pGSK3βSer9 than GL2 tumors (Fig.6C).
In line with the above reported in vitro results, Notch3
depletion did not affect phosphorylation and localization
of ERK1/2 which resulted almost identical in GL2 and
Notch3 tumors. (Fig.6D). The correlation between in vivo
and in vitro studies suggest that, by keeping lower levels
of p21 and higher levels of pGSK3βSer9, Notch3 depleted
cells did not acquire resistance to sorafenib.

It was recently shown that ERK phosphorylation
levels in tumor tissues correlate with the time to
progression of patients affected by HCC. Indeed, in
resistant HCC patients ERK1/2 activity was highly
increased after 21 days of treatment with sorafenib [20].
We then explored possible mechanisms of sorafenib
resistance in the HepG2 cells because an enhanced
sorafenib sensitivity due to Notch3 ablation was higher
in Huh7 cells than in HepG2 cells in vitro (Fig.1B). We
found that ERK phosphorylation decreased after 24-48 h
of treatment with sorafenib (Suppl.Fig.2A) and gradually
increased after long sorafenib exposure (Fig.6A). In line
with these observations, increased levels of p21 and
decreased levels of pGSK3βSer9 were also observed while
p53 protein levels were almost unaffected (Fig.6A).

Notch3 regulates pGSK3βSer9 and p21 protein
levels in human HCC.
To assess to what extent our in-vitro findings are
representative of what occurs in human HCC, we analyzed
the expression of Notch3, p21 and pGSK3βSer9 proteins in
20 surgically resected HCCs by immunohistochemistry.
We found a significant inverse correlation between
Notch3 and pGSK3βSer9 proteins accumulation (Spearman
ρ= -0.666, p<0.01) and a significant direct correlation
between Notch3 and p21 proteins expression (Spearman
ρ= 0.681, p <0.01) (Fig.7) suggesting that Notch3
participates in the control of GSK3β phosphorylation and
p21 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.

resistance in vitro and since p21 levels and pGSK3βSer9
are down-regulated and up-regulated respectively in

DISCUSSION

sorafenib sensitivity observed in Notch3 depleted HepG2
cells was mostly dependent on p21 and pGSK3.
Considering that resistance to sorafenib has been
observed in different clinical trials we analyze whether
p21 and pGSK3βSer9 were involved in mediating resistance
to the drug. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was rapidly reduced
after exposure to sorafenib but progressively returned to
baseline levels restoring the expression of p21, p53 and
pGSK3βSer9 proteins in HepG2 cells. In contrast with this
in vitro observation, Notch3 KD xenografts expressed
lower levels of p21 and higher levels of pGSK3βSer9 than
GL2 xenografts upon exposure to 21 days of sorafenib
whereas no difference were observed in p53 expression
between the two xenografts. In vivo, the association of
sorafenib and Notch3 depletion resulted in slower tumor
growth as demonstrated by reduced tumor volume and
decreased Ki-67 labeled growth fraction
Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is considered a
major mechanisms of HCC response to sorafenib. HCC
is a hypervascular tumor, and the use of anti-angiogenic
therapy has been extensively studied [30]. However antiangiogenic therapy elicits forms of adaptive resistance
that take to treatment failure [31]. Notch signaling
participates in multiple aspects of vascular development
including angiogenesis, differentiation and remodelling of
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) [32]. We proved
that combination of sorafenib and Notch3 depletion
significantly decreased both CD31 staining and VEGFR2
in vivo suggesting that Notch3 signaling by cancer cells
plays a role in neo-angiogenesis.
The results presented in this study demonstrate,
for the first time, that Notch3 inhibition enhances the
effect of sorafenib in human HCC. Importantly, we
present evidence that the effects of Notch3 depletion in
sorafenib response are mediated by p21 and pGSK3βSer9
and, probably, by neo-angiogenesis inhibition. Our data
suggest also that the synergistic activity of sorafenib
with Notch3 mainly ends up in avoiding drug resistance.
Altough γ-secretase inhibitors are today evaluated as
promising inhibitors of Notch signaling in neoplastic
disease [33, 34], targeting Notch3 should be preferred for
HCC therapy to avoid additional damage to non neoplastic
cirrhotic liver [3].

It was recently shown, in large clinical trials, that
sorafenib treatment significantly prolongs survival of
patients with advanced HCC [1, 2], but the tumor response
rate was short because of drug resistance [21]. Therefore,
it is of great importance to either identify metabolic or
signalling cellular pathways that could be targeted to
enhance HCC sensitivity to sorafenib, or to understand
the mechanisms of sorafenib resistance. Notch pathway
is frequently deregulated in human cancer and inhibition
of Notch signaling has been described as a promising
strategy for tumors treatment [22]. It functions as an
oncogene but can also act as a tumour suppressor. These
apparently contradictory functions of Notch signalling
strongly indicate that the effects of Notch activation are
dependent on the cellular context [23]. In the present
study we report that Notch3 depletion enhances sorafenib
toxicity towards HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. We
found that either sorafenib treatment or Notch3 depletion
resulted in p21 down-regulation and pGSK3βSer9 upregulation whereas sorafenib, but not Notch3 depletion,
decreased p53 expression. Extensive studies have
demonstrated that sorafenib mediates apoptosis through
MEK/ERK-dependent and independent mechanisms.
Examples include Gadd45β, the translation initiator elF4E
and Mcl-1 [24-26]. In line with this we showed that the
reduced levels of p21 observed in sorafenib treated cells
are ERK1/2 dependent. Conversely, sorafenib can increase
pGSK3βSer9 levels whereas ERK1/2 silencing cannot. We
then demonstrated that p21 silencing in association with
GSK3β silencing or inactivation enhanced sorafenib
sensitivity of HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. Thus our
observations are consistent with the active role assigned
to p21 in inhibiting apoptosis [20, 27, 28] and with the
critical role played by GSK3β in cell survival [29]. As far
as p53 is concerned, we found that sorafenib treatment
in HCC cells resulted in enhanced mRNA expression
but reduced protein levels. The induction of p53 mRNA
is probably related to the pro-apoptotic stimulus induced
by sorafenib. However, the lower level of p53 protein
in sorafenib treated cells were consistent with reduced
expression of the sorafenib targets ERK1/2. In support of
the latter possibility, siRNA mediated ERK1/2 knockdown
also reduced p53 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cells.
Moreover p53 depletion does not affect the sensitivity to
long sorafenib exposure in HCC cells suggesting that p53
is not a key factor in mediating sorafenib response. Of
interest here is our previous finding that Notch3 protects
HCC from doxorubicin-induced death by controlling p53
levels [7]. Therefore, it seems that different pathways
might be involved when Notch3 depletion is associated
to the administration of a chemotherapeutic agents, like
doxorubicin, or to the administration of a biologically
active agent [29].
Overall, the above data indicate that the enhanced

Cell lines and Notch3 knockdown by retroviral
transduction of shRNAs

using US imaging. At the end of the treatment, animals
were sacrificed and each tumor mass was collected for
laboratory analysis.

The human hepatocarcinoma cell lines HepG2
and Huh7 were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) at the end of
2011. Cells have not been authenticated by the authors.
HepG2 cells were maintained in Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Media (MEM) while Huh7 cells were maintained
in RPMI. Media were supplemented with 10% of fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100
mg/ml of streptomycin (all reagent from ATCC) at 37
°C in 5% CO2 incubator. Notch3 knock down (KD) was
obtained using short hairpin oligonucleotides targeted
to different Notch3 exons inserted into the pSuper.
puro expression vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) as
previously described (7). Since two Notch3 specific
shRNAs were equally effective in our previous study
(7) we performed the experiments by selecting a single
shRNA (shN3). Cells harbouring a pSuper.puro provirus
expressing a GL2 luciferase specific shRNA were used as
negative control (35).

Small interfering RNA transfections
HepG2 and Huh7 cells were seeded into 6 well
plates and transfected with 20 nM of p53 (Invitrogen) ,
p21(IDT, Thief River Falls , MN, USA), GSK3, ERK1/2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) siRNAs or scrambled
siRNA (scRNA) using Lipofectamine2000 (InVitogen).
Transfection efficiencies were greater than 90% as
determined by co-transfection with a fluorescein-labelled
siRNA (InVitrogen). Five hours were allowed to elapse
before treatment with sorafenib 4 µM. Cells were collected
at 5 h and 72 h post-transfection and proteins expression
was analyzed by western-blot.

SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
Protein extraction and quantification were performed
as previously described [7]. Primary antibodies were as
follows: anti-Notch3 polyclonal antibody (sc-5593, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) , anti-p21 monoclonal antibody
(Clone SX118, Dako, Denmark), anti-p53 monoclonal
antibody (Clone DO-7, Dako), anti-Cleaved Caspase 3
monoclonal antibody (9664, Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA), anti-p-ERK monoclonal antibody (sc7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal
antibody (9102, Cell Signaling) anti-GSK3β monoclonal
antibody (sc-7291, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p
GSK3β monoclonal antibody (9323, Cell Signaling)
anti-pAkt monoclonal antibody (2965, Cell Signaling),
anti-VEGF Receptor 2 monoclonal antibody (2479, Cell
Signaling), anti-CD31 polyclonal antibody (ab28364
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-β-actin monoclonal
antibody (Clone AC-40, Sigma) Immunoreactivites were
revealed with the EnVision dextran polymer visualization
system (Dako).

Compounds and cell death assays
Sorafenib was obtained by Bayer Healthcare (BAY
43-9006, Italy), Okadaic acid was purchased from Sigma
and GDC-0941 was obtained by Selleckem (Houston, TX,
USA). Caspase 8 inhibithor (Z-IETD-FMK), Caspase 9
inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) and negative control (Z-FAFMK) were from BD (Oxford, England).
Stably infected cell populations of HepG2 and Huh7
were seeded into 6-well dishes and allowed to attach for
24 hours before treatments. Cell death was revealed and
quantified by multiple criteria. Our primary quantitative
assay was trypan blue uptake. Apoptosis was also revealed
by Annexin V-FITC (Bender Medsystems, Vienna,
Austria) staining via FACS. Initiation of cell death was
assessed by the appearance of cleaved caspase 8, 9 and
3 in western blots (36). Cellular necrosis was assessed
by LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release by control vs.
sorafenib treated cells.

RNA analysis
Total cellular RNAs were prepared with Trizol
(InVitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Two micrograms of total
RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II
(InVitrogen). Relative gene expressions were determined
by semi-quantitative end-point PCR. PCR primers were
as follow:
NOXA (FW 5’cgagaattcgagatgcctgggaag-3’,
REV 5’ cttggtaccggttcctgagcag-3’)

Xenografts mouse model and treatments.
Seven-to eight week-old NOD/SCID female mice
(Harlan, Udine, Italy) were inoculated subcutaneously
with 5 x 106 HepG2 cells (GL2 or shN3) or with 3 x 106
Huh7 cells (GL2 or shN3). Treatment with sorafenib
was initiated when tumor nodules reached 130 mm3 to
200 mm3 in volume as determined by ultrasonography
(US) imaging. Sorafenib was given by oral gavages for
21 consecutive days at 60 mg/kg dose; tumor volume
during treatment period was monitored weekly by

expressed as the mean ± SE from three independent
experiments. T-test was also used to explore significant
difference in tumor growth between control and Notch3
silenced xenografts. Spearman’s correlation was used
to explore the relationships between Notch3 and p21
or Notch3 and pGSK3βser9 expression in HCC tissues.
P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 19.0.

Patient samples
Twenty patients of both sexes undergoing partial
hepatectomy for HCC entered the study. Informed
consent was obtained from each patient according to
Italian guidelines and the latest version of the Helsinki
Declaration. Exclusion criteria were a previous history
of local or systemic treatments for HCC. Tissues sample
were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded for
histopathology and immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The presence and localization of pERK1/2,
CD31and Ki67 (Dako) in tumor xenografts and the
expression of Notch3, p21, pGSK3βSer9 , in human HCCs,
were immunohistochemically assessed on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded sections. Serial 4 µm thick sections
were processed for haematoxylin and eosin staining and
for immunohistochemistry. Endogenous peroxidases
were inhibited by incubating slides in 3% H2O2–methanol
for 20 min at 4°C. For antigen retrieval, slides were
immersed in pH 6.0 citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled
using a microwave owen. Negative controls were obtained
by omitting the primary antibody. Immunoreactivity
was revealed with the EnVision system (DAKO), and
diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen (Sigma, ST Louis,
USA).
Slides were counterstained in Meyer’s hematoxylin,
coverslipped and examined by light microscopy.
Microvessel density (MVD), calculated as the average
of microvessel counts in seven randomly selected 40x
fields using a motorized stage (Marzhauser, Wetzlar,
Germany), was used to represent tumor angiogenesis
activity. Ki67 staining was quantified by image cytometry
using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, USA) on at
least 7 randomly selected consecutive fields at 40 x and
expressed as the percentage of positive nuclei over the
total nuclei (Labeling index:LI). Staining was assessed by
two independent observers (L. G., C. G.) who evaluated
the percentage of positive hepatocytes in each fields.
Results represent the average of the percentage from 10
consecutive 20 x magnification fields.
