Abstract
Metformin (Met) is an approved antidiabetic drug currently
being explored for repurposing in cancer treatment based on recent
evidence of its apparent chemopreventive properties. Met is weakly
cationic and targets the mitochondria to induce cytotoxic effects in
tumor cells, albeit not very effectively. We hypothesized that
increasing its mitochondria-targeting potential by attaching a
positively charged lipophilic substituent would enhance the antitumor activity of Met. In pursuit of this question, we synthesized a
set of mitochondria-targeted Met analogues (Mito-Mets) with
varying alkyl chain lengths containing a triphenylphosphonium
cation (TPPþ). In particular, the analogue Mito-Met10, synthesized
by attaching TPPþ to Met via a 10-carbon aliphatic side chain, was

nearly 1,000 times more efﬁcacious than Met at inhibiting cell
proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Notably, in PDAC cells, Mito-Met10 potently inhibited mitochondrial
complex I, stimulating superoxide and AMPK activation, but had
no effect in nontransformed control cells. Moreover, Mito-Met10
potently triggered G1 cell-cycle phase arrest in PDAC cells,
enhanced their radiosensitivity, and more potently abrogated
PDAC growth in preclinical mouse models, compared with Met.
Collectively, our ﬁndings show how improving the mitochondrial
targeting of Met enhances its anticancer activities, including aggressive cancers like PDAC in great need of more effective therapeutic
options. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3904–15. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (10). The organic cation transporter is responsible for Met uptake into tumor cells,
while more lipophilic Met analogues (e.g., phenformin) are taken
up into cells via alternate mechanism(s) (11). Phenformin is
more potent than Met in inhibiting pancreatic tumor cell proliferation (12). However, phenformin was taken off the market in
the United States because of increased incidence of acidosis
during antidiabetic therapy (13). Additional clinical research
repurposing phenformin as an antitumor drug was recently
recommended (14).
Previous reports suggest that mitochondria-targeted cationic
agents induce antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in tumor cells
without markedly affecting normal cells (15, 16). For example,
conjugating a nitroxide, quinone, a chromanol moiety of
a-tocopherol to the triphenylphosphonium (TPPþ) group via an
aliphatic linker increased their antiproliferative effect in tumor
cells (15, 16). Selective toxicity to tumor cells as compared with
normal cells was attributed to enhanced uptake and retention of
TPPþ-containing compounds in tumor cell mitochondria (16).
Met has been used in the clinic for over 50 years and has a very
good safety proﬁle (diabetic patients tolerate daily doses of 2–3 g;
refs. 1–4). Efforts to improve and enhance efﬁcacy of Met involved
modiﬁcation of structure by attaching alkyl or aromatic groups
`(e.g., butformin, phenformin; ref. 17; Fig. 1A). We hypothesized
that improved mitochondrial targeting of Met by attaching a
positively charged lipophilic substituent would result in a new
class of mitochondria-targeted drugs with signiﬁcantly increased
antitumor potential. To this end, we synthesized and characterized several Met analogues (e.g., Mito-Met2, Mito-Met6, MitoMet10, Mito-Met12; Fig. 1A) conjugated to an alkyl substituent
containing a TPPþ moiety (Supplementary Fig. S1). The current

Metformin (Met) is a synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring biguanides. It is an antidiabetic drug (1, 2) that exerts
anticancer effects in diabetic individuals with pancreatic cancer
(3, 4). Met exists as a hydrophilic cation (Fig. 1A) at physiologic
pH and weakly targets mitochondria (5). A prevailing view is that
Met exerts antitumor effects by elevating cellular AMP/ATP ratio
and activating the 50 -AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK)/
mTOR pathway (6, 7) and/or by decreasing circulating insulin
and blood glucose levels (8). Met also inhibits complex I in the
mitochondrial electron transport chain and tumor mitochondrial
respiration (9). Met suppresses gluconeogenesis by inhibiting

results show that Mito-Met10 is nearly 1,000-fold more effective
than Met in inhibiting pancreatic ductal adenoma cell (PDAC)
proliferation in vitro and more effective than Met in abrogating
PDAC tumor growth in vivo. Mito-Met10 inhibited mitochondrial
complex I, stimulating superoxide generation and AMPK activation, more potently than Met in MiaPaCa-2 cells. Reports suggest
that Met (1 mmol/L) pretreatment followed by radiation resulted
in enhanced cancer cell killing (17–19). In this study, we show
that Mito-Met10 enhanced radiation sensitivity in PDAC to the
same extent as did Met (1 mmol/L) but at a 1,000-fold lower
concentration (1 mmol/L). The ﬁnding that relatively nontoxic
mitochondria-targeted Met analogues alone or in combination
with radiotherapy could inhibit pancreatic cancer cell proliferation is highly relevant.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, HPNE, IEC-6, and MCF-10A cell lines
were obtained from the ATCC, where they were regularly authenticated. N27 cell line was a gift from Dr. Anumantha Kanthasamy
(Iowa State University, Ames, IA). FC-1242 cell line was a gift of
Dr. David Tuveson and Dr. Dannielle Engle (Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY), and was derived from
C57BL/6(B6) KPC transgenic mice that spontaneously developed
pancreatic tumors. This cell line was subsequently engineered to
express luciferase (FC-1242-luc) to enable monitoring of in vivo
tumor growth (20). All cells were obtained over the last ﬁve years,
stored in liquid nitrogen, and used within 20 passages after
thawing.
Respiratory enzyme activity in intact and permeabilized cells
The mitochondrial function in intact and permeabilized cells
was measured using a Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience). Assays in intact cells were performed as
described previously (21). Measurement of the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in permeabilized cells was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy,
intact cells were permeabilized using 1 nmol/L Plasma Membrane
Permeabilizer (PMP, Seahorse Bioscience) immediately before
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurement by XF96. The
oxygen consumption derived from mitochondrial complex I or
complex II activity was measured by providing different substrates
to mitochondria, for example, pyruvate/malate for complex I and
succinate for complex II (22, 23). Rotenone, malonate, and
antimycin A were used as speciﬁc inhibitors of mitochondrial
complex I, II, and III, respectively.
Clonogenic assay and cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded as indicated in 6-well plates and treated with
Mito-Met10 or Met for 24 hours. The plates were kept within the
incubator and media changed every 3 to 4 days until the control
cells formed sufﬁciently large clones. The cell survival fractions
were calculated as before (21).
Cell proliferation was measured using a label-free, noninvasive
cellular conﬂuence assay by IncuCyte Live-Cell Imaging Systems
(IncuCyte FLR, Essen Bioscience), as described previously (21).
Three-dimensional spheroid cell culture
MiaPaCa-2 cells (5  103 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well
plates containing Matrigel (Corning). The culture medium (con-

3906 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

taining appropriate concentration of Met or Mito-Met10) was
replaced every two days. At days 3, 7, and 14, the images were
acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon
Inc.). Spheroid-forming cells were counted using the Nikon NIS
Elements imaging software.
Cytotoxicity assay
To determine the cytotoxicity of Mito-Met analogues and other
TPPþ-conjugated compounds, we used the Sytox Green–based
assay as described previously (16). MiaPaCa-2 cells were treated
for 24 hours, and dead cells were monitored in real time in the
presence of 200 nmol/L Sytox Green (Invitrogen) under an
atmosphere of 5% CO2:95% air at 37 C. Data are represented
as a percentage of dead cells after normalization to total cell
number (measured with Sytox Green after a 3-hour treatment
with 0.065% Triton X-100) for each group.
Immunoblotting
Cells were serum-starved for 5 hours (AMPK) or 24 hours
(FOXM1). Stimulations with Met or Mito-Met10 were performed
for 30 minutes in serum-free medium (AMPK) or for 24 hours in
full growth media (FOXM1). After stimulation, cells were washed,
lysed using a modiﬁed RIPA buffer, and the proteins immunoblotted. Antibodies against FOXM1 (D12D5), cyclin D1 (92G2),
phospho-AMPK(40H9), or total AMPK (D5A2) anti-sera were
from Cell Signaling Technology. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence and quantiﬁed by densitometric analysis using the
FluorChem HD2 software (Cell Biosciences).
Cell-cycle analysis
PANC1 cells (5  105) were seeded into 35-mm dishes and
immediately treated with 10 mmol/L Met or 10 mmol/L MitoMet10 in complete media. At 48 hours after treatment, cells were
ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100
in PBS, and stained using a propidium iodide/RNase solution
(20 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, respectively). Data were collected on
the BD-LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed
using Flow-Jo (Flow-Jo LLC).
Quantiﬁcation of intracellular Mito-Met analogues by
LC-MS/MS
Cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and incubated with the
compounds for 24 hours in full media. The protocol for extraction
of Mito-Met analogues was the same as described previously, but
without butylated hydroxytoluene (16). LC-MS/MS analyses were
performed using a Kinetex Phenyl-Hexyl column (50 mm  2.1
mm, 1.7 mm, Phenomenex) equilibrated with water:acetonitrile
mixture (4:1) containing 0.1% formic acid. Compounds were
eluted by increasing the content of acetonitrile from 20% to 100%
over 4 minutes and detected using the MRM mode.
Radiation experiments
MiaPaCa-2, HPNE, and MCF-10A cells (5  105/dish) were
seeded in 6-cm dishes and treated with Mito-Met10 or Met for 24
hours. The control cells were treated with the vehicle (0.1%
DMSO), where appropriate. The cells were then exposed to Xradiation (0–6 Gy). After irradiation, cells were suspended and
seeded at various densities (100–8,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates
for clonogenic assay as described above. The plates were kept
within the incubator and media changed every 4–6 days for

Enhanced Antiproliferative Effects of Mito-Metformin

2 weeks. Wells with 10 to 50 sufﬁciently large clones were chosen
for calculating the cell survival fractions.
In vivo studies and bioluminescence imaging
An orthotopic syngeneic engraftment model was used to assess
metastatic homing and tumor progression after treatment with
Met or Mito-Met10. Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane and were injected with 1  106
luciferase-expressing FC-1242 (FC-1242-luc) cells (24). To generate FC-1242-luc cells, the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene was cloned into
the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/hygro(-) cells transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life
Technologies). A cell line stably expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase was
generated by culturing cells in growth medium supplemented
with 0.5 mg/mL hygromycin and limited dilution cloning. A
stable FC-1242-luc clone was expanded to generate a frozen stock.
Cells were pretreated for 48 hours with Met (1 mmol/L) or MitoMet10 (0.5 mmol/L) and then orthotopically engrafted to the
pancreas as described previously (24–26). Starting the day of
implantation, mice were treated daily with 1 mg/kg Met or MitoMet10 administered via an intraperitoneal injection in a 200-mL
volume. Tumor growth and metastasis was monitored using
bioluminescence imaging (Lumina IVIS 100, Perkin Elmer) on
days 1, 7, and 13 (26, 27). After 13 days, mice were euthanized,
and the size of primary tumor determined using calipers. Metastasis to the liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and lung was
assessed ex vivo using bioluminescence imaging.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.
Paired analyses were performed using a Student t test. Multiple
comparisons were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey
post hoc tests to identify pair-wise differences between distinct
experimental groups. All values provided represent mean  SD.

Results
Syntheses and characterization of mitochondria-targeted Met
analogues with varying side-chain lengths
The Mito-Met analogues (Fig. 1A) were synthesized according to
the reaction shown in Supplementary Fig. S1E and characterized by
nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. S1). Mito-Mets (n ¼ 2, 6, 10, and 12) were obtained by
reacting the corresponding aminoalkyltriphenylphosphonium
substrate with dicyanamide and puriﬁed by preparative-HPLC.
Experimental details are provided in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Mito-Met inhibits PDAC cell and PDAC spheroid growth more
potently than Met
To compare the antiproliferative effects of Met and Mito-Met10,
human MiaPaCa-2 cells were treated with Met (0.1–2 mmol/L) or
Mito-Met10 (0.1–1 mmol/L). Cell proliferation curves, as measured by cell conﬂuence kinetics and representative phase contrast
images, are shown in Fig. 1B. Under the conditions used, untreated cells reached 100% conﬂuence in 5 to 6 days. Mito-Met10
treatment (0.2 and 1 mmol/L) inhibited cell growth by 70% and
>90%, respectively. In contrast, Met inhibited cell growth by 80%
at 1,000-fold higher concentrations (1 mmol/L; Fig. 1B). A similar
trend was noticed at 20% and 1% oxygen (Fig. 1B). Mito-Met10
was also signiﬁcantly more potent than Met in inhibiting proliferation of mouse pancreatic cancer cells, FC-1242 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We also monitored colony formation in MiaPaCa-2 cells after a
24-hour treatment with different concentrations of Met or MitoMet10 under similar conditions. Almost no colony formation
was detected in cells treated with 3 mmol/L of Mito-Met10 and
3 mmol/L of Met (Fig. 1C, left). The survival fraction analysis
(Fig. 1C, right) showed that the IC50 values determined for Met
and Mito-Met10 were 1.3 mmol/L and 1.1 mmol/L, respectively.
Thus, results from two independent cell growth assays revealed
that Mito-Met10 is nearly 1,000-fold more potent than Met in
inhibiting MiaPaCa-2 cell proliferation.
To compare the cytotoxic effects of Met, Mito-Met10, and
selected other TPPþ-linked compounds, MiaPaCa-2 cells were
treated with Mito-Met10 (100 mmol/L) or Met (30–100 mmol/L)
and other TPPþ-linked compounds for 24 hours and cell death
was monitored in real time using the Sytox Green assay (Supplementary Fig. S3). Surprisingly, there was no detectable cell death
induced by Mito-Met10 even at 100-fold higher concentrations
(100 mmol/L) than needed to completely block cell proliferation.
In contrast, other mitochondria-targeted agents (e.g., Mito-CP,
Mito-Q, Mito-CP-Ac, Mito-Tempol, and Mito-Chromanol) were
considerably more cytotoxic to MiaPaCa-2 cells under these
conditions. Intracellular ATP levels measured under these conditions for selected compounds are consistent with the results
obtained using the Sytox Green assay.
We also tested the antiproliferative effects of Mito-Met10 and
Met in a multicellular tumor spheroid model. As shown in Fig. 2,
Mito-Met10 (0.5 mmol/L) more potently inhibited PDAC spheroid
growth than Met (10 mmol/L). Thus, both two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) cell growth assays indicate that Mito-Met10 is
1,000- to 10,000-fold more effective than Met in inhibiting PDAC
proliferation.

Effects of Mito-Met analogues in normal and cancer cells: ﬁne
tuning alkyl side-chain length and potency
We compared the relative antiproliferative potencies of other
Mito-Met analogues (Mito-Met2, Mito-Met6) with Mito-Met10,
phenformin, and Met in normal and cancer cells. Figure 3A
compares the antiproliferative effects of Mito-Met10 (left) and
Met (right) in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 and in nonmalignant
control cells, HPNE, IEC-6, and N27 cells. Mito-Met10 and Met
more potently inhibited proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1
cells as compared with normal cells (HPNE, IEC-6, and N27; Fig.
3A). Furthermore, we performed detailed cell viability analyses in
Mito-Met10 and Dec-TPPþ (same length of the aliphatic linker as
Mito-Met10) treated MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells and in nonmalignant HPNE and IEC-6 control cells. Over a wide range of
concentrations and incubation times, Dec-TPPþ did not show any
selectivity with regard to inhibition of cell viability in PDAC versus

nonmalignant cells. However, Met conjugated to TPPþ (e.g., MitoMet10) more potently decreased pancreatic cancer cell viability as
compared with normal cell viability, with signiﬁcantly lower IC50
values in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells as compared with HPNE
and IEC-6 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 3B shows the
relative potencies of Mito-Met analogues (Mito-Met2, Mito-Met6,
and Mito-Met10, phenformin, and Met) in inhibiting MiaPaCa-2
colony formation. Mito-Met2 and Mito-Met6 were relatively less
potent than Mito-Met10 in inhibiting MiaPaCa-2 cell proliferation
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Next, we investigated the relative uptake of different Mito-Met analogues (MitoMet2, Mito-Met6, and Mito-Met10) and phenformin in MiaPaCa-2
cells by LC-MS (Fig. 3C). Cells were treated with respective Met
analogue (1 mmol/L) for 1 hour. As shown in Fig. 3C, there was a
dramatic increase in Mito-Met cellular uptake as a function of
increasing carbon–carbon side-chain length and Mito-Met10 was

taken up nearly 100-fold more than phenformin. Under these
treatment conditions, Met uptake was considerably lower than
phenformin.
Effects of Met and Mito-Met analogues on mitochondrial
bioenergetics in MiaPaCa-2 cells
The oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were measured as a
readout of mitochondrial function (28). We compared the immediate OCR changes in MiaPaCa-2 cells in response to different

concentrations (e.g., at IC50 or higher values determined by
clonogenic assay) of Met, Mito-Mets, and phenformin
(Fig. 4A). Met dose-dependently decreased the OCR at relatively
higher concentrations (1–10 mmol/L). In contrast, the more
lipophilic phenformin inhibited OCR to the same extent (as did
Met) at more than 10-fold lower concentration (Fig. 4A). MitoMet10 inhibited proliferation most potently at submicromolar
concentration, but did not inhibit OCR at 1 mmol/L concentration. However, there was a slight inhibition at a higher

concentration of Mito-Met10 (10 mmol/L). Similar results were
observed at higher concentrations of Mito-Met6 and no inhibition
was noted with Mito-Met2 (Fig. 4A).
Next, we monitored the mitochondrial respiration rates in
MiaPaCa-2 cells after longer treatment (24 hours) with Met,
Mito-Mets, and phenformin followed by a washout and replenishment with fresh assay media. A signiﬁcant decrease in OCR was
observed after a 24-hour treatment with all compounds tested
(Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that the extent of OCR
inhibition was dependent on the alkyl chain length with MitoMet2, Mito-Met6, and Mito-Met10 showing similar effects at the
concentrations of 25, 16, and 1 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Effect of Mito-Met10 and Met on PDAC radiosensitivity, cell
cycle, and AMPK activation
Both PDAC and control nonmalignant cells pretreated for 24
hours with Met (1 mmol/L) or Mito-Met (1 mmol/L) were subjected to X-irradiation, followed by a clonogenic assay. As shown
in Fig. 5A, Met pretreatment decreased MiaPaCa-2 cell growth
after irradiation, in agreement with previous reports indicating
radiosensitizing effects of Met in PDAC (29, 30). Radiation dose–
response results show that 1 mmol/L Mito-Met was as effective as 1
mmol/L Met in radiosensitization (Fig. 5A), whereas no radiosensitization was observed in nonmalignant cells (MCF-10A or
HPNE) pretreated with Mito-Met10 (Fig. 5A). Enhanced radiosensitivity in MiaPaCa-2 cells could be attributed to an increased
uptake and retention of Mito-Met10 in these cells, as compared
with normal (MCF-10A) cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Detailed
cell-cycle analysis showed that treatment with Mito-Met10, but not
Met, arrested PANC-1 cell growth in the G1 phase with a concomitant decrease in cyclin D1 levels (Fig. 5B).
Next, we investigated whether treatment with Mito-Met10 or
Met would have an effect on the FOXM1 pathway. FOXM1 is a
redox-responsive transcription factor that we have previously
shown is downregulated in malignant mesothelioma cells upon
treatment with mitochondria-targeted nitroxides (31). Treatment
of MiaPaCa-2 cells with Mito-Met10, but not Met, resulted in a
signiﬁcant decrease in FOXM1 levels (Fig. 5C, left). Similar results
were observed for PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). To better
understand potential upstream signaling events, we investigated
the AMPK–mTOR energy signaling pathway. The extent of AMPK
activation, measured as a ratio of phosphorylated to total protein,
showed an approximately 2-fold increase in active AMPK in
human (Fig. 5C, middle) and an approximately 4-fold increase
in pAMPK in murine FC-1242 PDAC cells treated with Mito-Met10
and Met (Fig. 5C, right). The increase in AMPK activation occurs at
a 1,000-fold lower concentration of Mito-Met10 than Met. Treatment with dorsomorphin (Compound C), a potent, reversible
AMPK inhibitor, counteracted the antiproliferative effects of MitoMet10 (Fig. 5D), suggesting a role for AMPK signaling mechanism.
Effects of Mito-Met analogues and Met on complex I activity
To better understand the role of mitochondrial respiratory
complex in Mito-Met and Met-mediated signaling pathways, we
used permeabilized and intact cells. The use of permeabilized cells
avoids differences in cellular uptake of compounds. Supplementary Figure S8 (left) shows OCR changes in control permeabilized
cells and in rotenone- or malonate-treated cells. Rotenone (complex I inhibitor) greatly diminished OCR that was restored by
adding succinate. However, in the presence of malonate (complex

3910 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

II inhibitor), addition of succinate did not stimulate OCR. Antimycin A decreased both pyruvate- and succinate-induced OCR.
These studies established the use of permeabilized cells in bioenergetics function assay (22, 23). Next, we used this model to
probe the effects of Met and Mito-Met analogues. The IC50 values
for Met and Mito-Met10 to inhibit complex I-mediated oxygen
consumption upon injection to permeabilized cells were determined to be 0.8 mmol/L and 2 mmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9). Next, we tested the effects of a 24-hour pretreatment of intact cells with Mito-Met10 or Met on complex I
activity. A signiﬁcant inhibition of complex I-dependent OCR was
observed (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S8). The IC50 values for
complex I inhibition in MiaPaCa-2 cells determined for Met and
Mito-Met10 were 1.1 mmol/L and 0.4 mmol/L, respectively. This
increased potency of Mito-Met10 to inhibit complex I activity is
consistent with the >1,000-fold enhanced antiproliferative effect
of Mito-Met10 versus Met. In contrast to pancreatic cancer cells,
higher concentrations of Mito-Met10 were required to inhibit
complex I in HPNE and IEC6 cells (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. S8). These results demonstrate the selectivity of Mito-Met10 in
inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in PDACs and suggest that
the enhanced antiproliferative effects of Mito-Met10 in PDAC cells
are related to their enhanced ability to inhibit complex I activity.
Inhibition of complex I enhances formation of superoxide and
other oxidants
One of the consequences of complex I inhibition is enhanced
generation of cellular oxidizing species (32). We used the cellpermeable probe hydroethidine (HE) to detect reactive oxygen
species. HPLC traces (Fig. 6B, left) and quantitative analyses of
products are shown (Fig. 6B, middle). Results indicate that MitoMet10 treatment of MiaPaCa-2 cells increased the formation of 2hydroxyethidium (2-OH-Eþ), a diagnostic marker product of HE/
superoxide reaction (Fig. 6B, right). In addition, a marked increase
in diethidium (Eþ-Eþ) formation was observed (Fig. 6B, middle),
indicating that Mito-Met10 also induced generation of one-electron oxidants. Under these conditions, Mito-Met10 did not stimulate O2  formation in control HPNE cells (Fig. 6B, middle),
consistent with its lack of inhibition of mitochondrial complex I
at the concentration tested. However, at the concentrations equal
or higher than IC50 (Fig. 3A), Mito-Met10 treatment increased the
formation of 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-Eþ) in HPNE cells (Supplementary Fig. S10).
A proposed model for Mito-Met10–induced antiproliferative
effect in PDAC via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity,
enhanced O2  generation, and AMPK activation is shown
in Fig. 6C.

Mito-Met inhibits tumor growth of KPC autografts in vivo
In vivo data show that Mito-Met suppresses tumor growth in a
preclinical mouse model (Fig. 6D). Syngeneic KPC cells expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase (FC-1242-luc) were orthotopically
implanted in the pancreas of C57BL/6 mice and tumor growth
monitored using bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 6D). Mice orthotopically autografted with FC-1242-luc cells (25) were treated
daily with Met (1 mg/kg) or Mito-Met10 (1 mg/kg). Consistent
with the cell culture data, Mito-Met10 was considerably more
effective than Met in mitigating PDAC growth (Fig. 1B) and the
treatment resulted in markedly smaller primary tumors at the
completion of the experiment (Fig. 6D). Weekly tracking

Enhanced Antiproliferative Effects of Mito-Metformin

detected an increased accumulation of this compound in liver,
kidney, spleen, and tumor tissues (Supplementary Fig. S11).
Collectively, results from the in vivo experiments indicate a potent
antitumor activity of Mito-Met10, with negligible off-target
toxicity.

Discussion
Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most
severe and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer with limited
chemo- and radiotherapeutic options to improve survival. Currently available standard-of-care chemotherapy offers limited
survival beneﬁt. There is critical unmet need for new therapeutic
approaches to mitigate therapeutic resistance mechanisms and
maximize multimodal treatment approaches in pancreatic cancer.
Here, we have developed new mitochondria-targeted metformin
analogues that alone and in combination with radiotherapy
markedly inhibited PDAC proliferation. The enhanced potency
of Mito-Met10 is attributed to mitochondrial ROS-dependent
activation of signal transduction pathway (involving AMPK activation) in PDAC cells. These mitochondria-targeted Met analogues may have signiﬁcant clinical and translational potential in
PDAC treatment.
Delocalized lipophilic cations inhibit tumor cell proliferation through selective accumulation into mitochondria and
inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (15, 16, 32). The mitochondrial membrane potential is much higher (more negative
inside) in tumor than in normal (nontransformed) cells (33).
The cationic compounds tethered to an alkyl chain accumulate
preferentially in tumor mitochondria depending upon the alkyl
side-chain length (15, 16). TPPþ-linked agents conjugated to
aromatic and heterocyclic groups (Mito-Chromanol, Mito-CP)
also exerted selective cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in various
tumor cells (15, 16, 34). Met exerts biologic activity through
alterations of cellular bioenergetics without undergoing any
detectable metabolism itself (1). Selective targeting of cancer
cell mitochondrial bioenergetics is an emerging chemotherapeutic strategy (5, 35). We, therefore, surmised that enhancing
its mitochondrial uptake would greatly increase Met's biologic
activity. Although several lipophilic variants of Met were synthesized and shown to exert increased antitumor potency, none
of these modiﬁcations included mitochondrial targeting cationic function. In this study, we showed and characterized, for
the ﬁrst time, that ﬁne-tuning of Met structure by attaching a
TPPþ group tethered to different alkyl chain lengths is synthetically feasible, and that these modiﬁed analogues increasingly
target tumor mitochondria. Consistent with enhanced intracel-

lular uptake, Mito-Met analogues were more potent than Met in
their ability to inhibit PDAC proliferation. The antiproliferative
potency of Mito-Met analogues increased with increasing
length of the alkyl linker (Mito-Met10 > Mito-Met6 > MitoMet2; Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5). Elongation of the
aliphatic linker to twelve carbon atoms (Mito-Met12) had no
further effect on its antiproliferative efﬁcacy, as compared with
Mito-Met10 (not shown). A major reason for the selective
antiproliferative effect of Mito-Met analogues in tumor cells
is due to their preferential accumulation and inhibition of
mitochondrial complex I activity in tumor cells as compared
with normal, nonmalignant cells.
At present, the mechanism(s) responsible for the enhanced
antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of Mito-Mets in
cancer cells remain unknown. It is likely that Mito-Met10 exerts
antiproliferative effects in PDACs via targeting the energy-sensing
bioenergetics pathway(s). Mito-Met10 activated AMPK in MiaPaCa-2 cells nearly 1,000-fold more potently than did Met (Fig.
5). AMPK, a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, is
typically activated by enhanced intracellular AMP (36). Under
conditions wherein intracellular ATP levels are decreased along
with a concomitant increase in AMP (enhanced AMP/ATP ratio),
AMPK is activated via phosphorylation of its threonine-172
residue (37). Previous research has shown that AMPK represses
the FOXM1 transcription factor expression through inhibition of
the AKT/FOXO3 signaling cascade, leading to regression of cervical cancer cell growth (31). Thus, it is conceivable that MitoMet10 and related analogues act on the AKT/FOXO3/FOXM1
signaling pathway.
Recently, it was reported that ROS activate two proteins, AMPactivated kinase and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in C. elegans and
that balancing ROS at optimal levels was crucial for their health
and longevity (38). Factors responsible for activation of AMPK
still need to be ascertained, although mitochondrial ROS was
implicated (38). We propose that Mito-Met10–mediated inhibition of complex I and superoxide generation, accompanied by
activation of AMPK, play an important role in inhibiting PDAC
proliferation (Fig. 6C).
As reported previously (29), pretreatment with Met increased
radiosensitivity of MiaPaCa-2 cells. The current data demonstrate
that Mito-Met10 is signiﬁcantly more effective than Met in PDAC
radiosensitization. Prevailing views suggest that the antiproliferative effects of Met are mediated by activation of the AMPK
pathway and/or improved tumor oxygenation (i.e., decreased
hypoxia) due to inhibition of mitochondria, leading to decreased
tumor cell respiration in irradiated tumors (29). The enhanced
radiosensitivity upon treatment with Mito-Met analogues may be

attributed to increased tumor oxygenation (i.e., decreased hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia (pO2 < 10 mm Hg), an intrinsic property of
numerous solid tumors including the pancreas, results from an
imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption
(39). Studies suggest that decreasing oxygen consumption with
pharmacologic drugs is an effective route for increasing tumor
oxygenation and radiosensitivity (40–42). Met (1–10 mmol/L)
reportedly improves tumor oxygenation and enhances tumor
radiosensitivity (29). The current results show that Mito-Met10
decreases mitochondrial respiration in MiaPaCa-2 cells after
24 hours. Mito-Met10 inhibited mitochondrial complex I activity
and tumor cell respiration at micromolar levels, whereas Met
inhibited respiration to a similar extent at millimolar levels. It is
likely that Mito-Met10 stimulates tumor oxygenation at concentrations 1,000-fold lower than that of Met. A plausible mechanism
by which Mito-Met10 decreased mitochondrial respiration may be
due to increased accumulation of Mito-Met10 in mitochondria,
leading to enhanced inhibition of complex I in the mitochondrial
electron transport chain (43). In the presence of radiation and
Mito-Met10, it is possible that two or more mechanisms operate.
AMPK-activating drugs increase tumor radiosensitivity (44). Radiation itself activates the AMPK energy sensor pathway (45).
However, the degree to which AMPK induces tumor oxygenation
and radiosensitivity remains poorly understood. Although Met
inhibits growth of glioblastoma cells and mTOR pathway, the
effects were found to be independent of AMPK (46). The same
study suggests that AMPK could potentially function as a tumor
growth supporter. Met-induced mTOR inhibition and suppression of glioma proliferation were attributed to enhanced
PRAS400 s association with RAPTOR (46). Clearly, the antiproliferative mechanism of action of Met and Mito-Met may also be
related to other mechanisms (i.e., activation of PRAS40/RAPTOR
association).
Recent reports suggest that suppression of FOXM1 enhances the
radiosensitivity of different human cancer cells (47). Mito-Met10,
at concentrations 1,000-fold lower than Met, inhibited mitochondrial respiration, activated AMPK, and signiﬁcantly decreased
FOXM1. Clearly, this is an exciting ﬁnding with signiﬁcant potential to clinical translation and requires additional mechanistic

studies. More recently, it was shown that at conventional antidiabetic doses of Met, there was no signiﬁcant therapeutic effect in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (48). The investigators
suggested that more potent biguanides should be used in cancer
treatment because of vastly reduced plasma concentrations typically detected in diabetic cancer patients treated with Met (48). It
is conceivable that Mito-Met10 exhibiting a 1,000-fold higher
potency than Met would achieve a therapeutically effective plasma concentration in humans.
