ABSTRACT:
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men in developed
countries. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, design of novel
personalized treatments is required to achieve efficient therapeutic responses. We
have recently identified phospholipase 2 group VII (PLA2G7) as a potential drug target
especially in ERG oncogene positive prostate cancers. Here, the expression profile
of PLA2G7 was studied in 1137 prostate cancer and 409 adjacent non-malignant
prostate tissues using immunohistochemistry to validate its biomarker potential
and putative association with disease progression. In order to reveal the molecular
alterations induced by PLA2G7 impairment, lipidomic and gene expression profiling
was performed in response to PLA2G7 silencing in cultured prostate cancer cells.
Moreover, the antineoplastic effect of statins combined with PLA2G7 impairment was
studied in prostate cancer cells to evaluate the potential of repositioning of in vivo
compatible drugs developed for other indications towards anti-cancer purposes. The
results indicated that PLA2G7 is a cancer-selective biomarker in 50 % of prostate
cancers and associates with aggressive disease. The alterations induced by PLA2G7
silencing highlighted the potential of PLA2G7 inhibition as an anti-proliferative, proapoptotic and anti-migratorial therapeutic approach in prostate cancer. Moreover,
the anti-proliferative effect of PLA2G7 silencing was potentiated by lipid-lowering
statins in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results support the potential of
PLA2G7 as a biomarker and a drug target in prostate cancer and present a rationale for
combining PLA2G7 inhibition with the use of statins in prostate cancer management.

therapeutic approaches. Given the heterogeneous nature
and the complexity of molecular pathways in prostate
cancer, combining different therapies may be a necessary
step towards significant therapeutic progress.

INTRODUCTION
Although prostate cancer is the most commonly
diagnosed malignancy and the second most common cause
of cancer mortality in men in developed countries [1], there
is a prevailing lack of efficient targeted and personalized

regulated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)
with oncogenic ETS transcription factors [2]. Ectopic
expression of the most frequent fusion partner, ERG (v-ets
erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog, avian),
promotes multiple signaling pathways associated with
cancer formation and progression [3-7]. However, ETS
gene fusions are a challenge to target and ERG mediated

oncogenic processes may be bypassed in advanced
prostate cancer [8]. Therefore, novel more efficient
therapeutic approaches for this patient group, as well as
for the early disease, would be of great importance.
Phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) was recently
found to be highly expressed especially in the tumors with
high ERG expression [4, 9]. ERG was shown to induce

strongly associates with prostate cancer. PLA2G7 was
expressed in 50.0 % of the primary prostate tumor samples,
whereas only 2.7 % of the adjacent normal tissues showed
any staining (Figure 1B-C and Supplemental Table S1).
Importantly, the positive staining of PLA2G7 significantly
correlated with high (≥ 7) Gleason score (Figure 1D and
Supplemental Table S1). In accordance to the association
of PLA2G7 expression and higher Gleason score, the
results from Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that
PLA2G7 positivity associates with poor survival and
more aggressive disease (Figure 1E).

the expression of PLA2G7, and knock-down of PLA2G7
significantly reduced the growth of ERG positive, but not
ERG negative, prostate cancer cells in vitro, indicating
potential as a biomarker and personalized drug target in
ERG positive prostate cancers [9]. Furthermore, PLA2G7
silencing was shown to sensitize prostate cancer cells to
oxidative stress [9]. However, the molecular alterations in
response to PLA2G7 expression in prostate cancer remain
to be elucidated.
In contrast to cancer, the role and therapeutic
potential of PLA2G7 has been under intensive research
in the area of cardiovascular diseases. Although PLA2G7
has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in a
variety of experimental models, it also degrades apoptosis
inducing oxidized phospholipids and simultaneously
generates atherogenic inflammatory products [10-12].
Accordingly, PLA2G7 mass and activity have been
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
diseases [13-16]. Interestingly, early results with PLA2G7
inhibitor, darapladib, have been promising in the
prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease [11,
17]. In addition, lipid-lowering statins are known to reduce
PLA2G7 mass and activity in plasma and atherosclerotic
plaques [14, 18, 19].
The aim of this study is to validate PLA2G7
as potential cancer selective biomarker, deepen our
understanding on its molecular and cellular function
and study the growth inhibitory potential of PLA2G7
impairment combined with statin exposure in cultured
prostate cancer cells. PLA2G7 expression was studied in
a large set of non-malignant prostate and prostate cancer
tissues using immunohistochemistry. In order to reveal
the changes induced by PLA2G7 impairment in prostate
cancer cells, lipidomic and gene expression profiling
was performed in cultured prostate cancer cells. The
antineoplastic effect of statins combined with PLA2G7
impairment was studied in prostate cancer cells to evaluate
the potential for repositioning of in vivo compatible drugs
developed for other indications towards anti-cancer
purposes.

PLA2G7 silencing decreases

of

Supporting the key role of altered lipid metabolism
in prostate carcinogenesis, westernized corn oil
containing diet has been shown to enhance cancer
progression in mice, whereas thiazolidinediones
have been reported to inhibit prostate cancer cell
growth in vitro and in vivo [20, 21]. In order to reveal
the lipidomic changes induced by PLA2G7 impairment,
cellular lipidomic profiles were analyzed in ERG positive
VCaP prostate cancer cells expressing PLA2G7 at high
levels (Figure 2A). Target gene silencing was confirmed
using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis (Figure 2B).
Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass
Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) results indicate that the most
prominent change in response to 48 h PLA2G7 silencing
was a decrease in the cellular lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC,
PC(16:0/0:0),
1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine) level (Figure 2C and Supplemental Table
S2). This is in agreement with the known function of
PLA2G7 in cardiovascular diseases and previous results
with PLA2G7 inhibitor treatment showing significant
decrease in LPC levels in the arteries of pigs with induced
diabetes and hypercholesterolemia [11].

PLA2G7 silencing induces apoptosis

RESULTS

To get additional insights into the molecular
mechanisms regulated by PLA2G7, genome-wide gene
expression profiling was performed in PLA2G7 impaired
prostate cancer cells. The results indicated that cell-tocell signaling and interaction, as well as cell death were
the most significantly enriched biological processes in
response to PLA2G7 silencing (Table 1 and Supplemental
Table S3). Induction of cell death, validated by measuring
pro-apoptotic CASP8 and anti-apoptotic BCL2L1 mRNA
expression (Figure 2D), is in accordance to our previous
results, since PLA2G7 silencing was shown to induce
caspase 3 and 7 activity in VCaP cells [9], indicating that
PLA2G7 silencing activates both intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptotic pathways.

PLA2G7 is a potent biomarker distinguishing
prostate cancer from non-malignant prostate
tissues
Tissue microarray (TMA) containing samples from
primary prostate tumors (n = 1137) along with adjacent
normal tissues (n = 409) was utilized to study PLA2G7
expression in prostate tissues. The samples were stained
with previously validated PLA2G7 specific antibody, and
the staining intensity was scored as presented in Figure
1A [9]. The results confirmed that PLA2G7 expression

well as metastasis-initiating prostate cancer cells [25].
Taken together, these results support the association of
PLA2G7 expression with aggressive disease and suggest
that PLA2G7 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis via
inducing ALDH activity.

PLA2G7 silencing reduces tumorigenesis
inducing aldehyde dehydrogenase activity
The presence of self-renewing and multi-potent
cancer stem cells has been studied also in prostate cancer
and signaling pathways implicated in the regulation of
stem cell features such as neuroendocrine differentiation
have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets in
prostate cancer [22]. Interestingly, PLA2G7 silencing
reduced the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1
(ALDH1A1) (Figure 2E), described as a prostate cancer
stem cell marker and associated with poor prostate
cancer outcome [23, 24]. Furthermore, PLA2G7 silencing
reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity to the
same level as ALDH inhibitor (Figure 2E). High ALDH
activity has been reported to identify tumor-initiating as

PLA2G7 silencing reduces cell adhesion and
motility
The results from the genome-wide gene expression
profiling indicated that cell motility and invasion
related canonical pathways were among the top altered
processes in response to PLA2G7 silencing (Table 1
and Supplemental Table S3). Furthermore, the most
outstanding change in the gene expression profile 48 h
after PLA2G7 knock-down was the increased mRNA

prostate cancer. Since VCaP cells do not migrate in wound
healing experiment nor grow in 3D matrix [26], PC-3 cells,
expressing PLA2G7 (Figure 2A), were selected as a model
to validate the functional effect of PLA2G7 silencing on
prostate cancer cell motility and invasion. Interestingly,
as previously seen in LNCaP cells [9], PLA2G7 silencing
did not affect PC-3 cell viability (Figure 4B). However,
the migratory capacity of PC-3 cells both in 2D and 3D
cultures was decreased (Figure 4C-D) confirming the role
of PLA2G7 in promoting prostate cancer cell migration
and invasion.

prostate cancer cells have revealed that long exposure
time (ad 5d) and micromolar concentrations of statins are
needed to reduce cell growth in vitro [27-30].
The results from this study indicated that although
PLA2G7 protein levels were not consistently affected by
statins, the enzymatic activity of PLA2G7 was reduced
by all four statins studied (Figure 5A-B). Furthermore,
simvastatin, fluvastatin and lovastatin were able to
inhibit PLA2G7 enzymatic activity synergistically with
PLA2G7 siRNA. Due to these results connecting statins
with PLA2G7 function also in prostate cancer, the effect
of statins in combination with PLA2G7 knock-down on
VCaP cell viability was analyzed. Interestingly, even
though the changes in cell viability were studied already
after 48 h combinatorial treatment, the results indicated
that statins synergistically reinforced the anti-proliferative
effect of PLA2G7 silencing (Figure 5C).

Statins potentiate the antiproliferative effect of
PLA2G7 inhibition
Since statins are known to inhibit PLA2G7 in
atherosclerotic plaques [19], their ability to reduce
PLA2G7 expression and activity in VCaP prostate cancer
cells was elucidated. However, although epidemiologic
evidence supports the possible chemopreventive potential
of statins in prostate cancer, previous studies with cultured

cancer management. By determining the expression
level of PLA2G7 in malignant and healthy prostate
samples from 453 prostate cancer patients, the biomarker
potential of PLA2G7 and the size of the potential patient
group benefiting from PLA2G7 inhibition therapy, was
evaluated. The cellular responses to PLA2G7 inhibition
were studied to understand the PLA2G7 driven biological
and oncogenic processes in prostate cancer cells.
Furthermore, as combinatorial therapeutic approaches
may be required to obtain significant therapeutic progress,
the ability of statins to potentiate the anti-proliferative
effect of PLA2G7 impairment in prostate cancer cells was
investigated.
Immunohistochemical staining results indicated that
PLA2G7 is a potential prostate cancer biomarker present
in approximately 50 percent of tumors in our cohort, and
associating with high grade prostate tumors. Moreover,

PLA2G7 impairment reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity, considered as a marker of prostate cancer stem
cells as well as tumor- and metastasis-initiating prostate
cancer cells [23-25] supporting the possibility that
PLA2G7 expression may have prognostic significance.
This hypothesis is further supported by our previous
results demonstrating PLA2G7 protein expression in
70 % of metastatic prostate tumors compared to the 50
% positivity observed in the primary tumors [9]. Since
PLA2G7 is induced by ERG and is highly expressed
especially in the ERG positive prostate cancers, it is a
putative biomarker for this subgroup of prostate cancers
[4, 9]. The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect
of PLA2G7 impairment was seen in the ERG positive
prostate cancer cells, indicating that ERG positive
prostate cancer cells are dependent on PLA2G7 function
[9]. However, PLA2G7 positivity is not restricted to ERG

positive cancer cells since other oncogenic mutations have
been recently shown to induce PLA2G7 expression [31].
PLA2G7 impairment modulated the levels of multiple
lipids in prostate cancer cells, the most striking being the
reduction in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). In addition
to promoting cardiovascular diseases, LPC is known to
increase the expression of cell-to-cell adhesion molecules
on endothelial cells and to induce the migration and
proliferation of smooth muscle cells [32, 33]. Furthermore,
LPC has been linked to cancer cell migration and metastasis
via promoting invadopodia formation in multiple cancer
cell lines as well as migration of PC-3 prostate cancer
cells [34, 35]. Our results support a similar role for LPC
in prostate cancer cells since PLA2G7 silencing followed
by reduced LPC levels resulted in changes in multiple
adhesion molecules, such as decrease in the expression
of cell-to-cell adhesion molecules NCAM1 and DSCAM,

ERG activation

and increase in extracellular matrix binding ITGB1. In
addition to accelerated adhesion to fibronectin, PLA2G7
silencing reduced cell migration and invasion in prostate
cancer cell culture models. Furthermore, Rac1, CDC42
and STAT3 signaling, known to promote invadopodia
formation and metastasis, were reduced by PLA2G7
impairment [36, 37]. STAT3 is also known to promote
androgen-independent growth in cultured prostate cancer
cells [38], giving additional support to the beneficial effect
of PLA2G7 inhibition in prostate cancer management. The
anti-migratory effect was not restricted to ERG positive
prostate cancer cells supporting the rationale of PLA2G7
inhibition in the prevention and treatment of aggressive
and metastatic tumors. Interestingly, PLA2G7 silencing
was recently shown to reduce xenograft growth of colon
cells expressing mutant p53 and activated Ras [31],
indicating that in addition to prostate cancers, PLA2G7

PLA2G7 expression and enzymatic function can be activated by e.g. ERG oncogene, inflammation or by substrates produced by oxidative
stress [9, 43]. Our results suggest that PLA2G7 is a potential novel prognostic and therapeutic biomarker associating with aggressive
disease. Therapeutic intervention impairing the expression or function of PLA2G7 induces multiple antineoplastic effects in cultured
prostate cancer cells. PLA2G7 inhibition sensitizes prostate cancer cells to oxidative stress induced damage, decreases tumorigenetic
potential and proliferation, as well as induces apoptosis and inhibits cancer cell migration. Moreover, clinically widely used statins inhibit
the enzymatic activity of PLA2G7 and synergistically inhibit prostate cancer cell viability with RNAi induced PLA2G7 inhibition.

may have potential as a drug target in other cancer types
as well.
In melanoma cells heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)
inhibitors have been suggested to exert part of their
antineoplastic effects by modulating phospholipase
activity and related metabolic changes [39]. Furthermore,
in cardiovascular diseases widely used and clinically well
tolerated lipid-lowering statins are known to exert part
of their beneficial effects via PLA2G7 inhibition [14,
18, 19]. This knowledge in combination with frequent
expression and vital function of PLA2G7 in ERG positive
prostate cancer cells provides a significant opportunity for
drug repositioning. Epidemiologic evidence supports the
possible chemopreventive potential of statins especially in
advanced prostate cancer, and recently statins have been
associated with better outcomes among men receiving
radiotherapy for prostate cancer [27, 28, 40, 41]. Statins
decrease androgen receptor protein expression and induce
apoptosis and cell growth arrest in cultured prostate
cancer cells, and suppress tumor growth in prostate cancer
mice xenografts [29, 30, 42]. Here we show for the first
time that statins reduce the enzymatic activity of PLA2G7
in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, a synergistic
anti-proliferative effect was observed in response to
combinatorial treatment with PLA2G7 inhibition and
statins in cultured prostate cancer cells.
In conclusion, we propose PLA2G7 as a prognostic
and theranostic biomarker, as well as a putative therapeutic
target in prostate cancer (Figure 6). PLA2G7 promotes
several oncogenic processes such as cell viability,
migration and invasion in prostate cancer. Moreover, this
is the first study connecting statin treatment with reduced
PLA2G7 activity in prostate cancer cells, and presents a
rationale for combining PLA2G7 inhibition with statins in
prostate cancer management.

ranging from 1 % to 100 %, and the median post-surgery
follow-up time was 13.3 (11.3 – 25.0) years.

Immunohistochemistry and statistical analysis of
stainings
Tissue microarray (TMA) blocks were constructed
using archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
prostatectomy blocks. Recipient blocks were predrilled
with an automated TMA instrument (TMA Master, 3D
Histech) and donor block cores (Ø 1.0 mm) were punched
manually (Tissue-Tek® Quick-RayTM, Sakura Finetek).
The TMA blocks consisted of four samples from each
patient; two tissue cores from the area containing the most
dominant Gleason grade pattern, one core out of the area
with second most dominant Gleason grade pattern and one
core from an adjacent benign glandular area. TMA blocks
contained a total of 1,802 cores. All cancer cores were
graded individually by experienced pathologists (A.S.,
S.N.) according to contemporary Gleason grading criteria.
Freshly cut TMA sections mounted on electrically
charged glass slides (SuperFrost® Plus, MenzelGläser, Germany) were stained with a fully automatic
immunohistochemical system Benchmark XT (Ventana
Medical Systems, Illkirch, France) using a biotinfree multimer-based detection system (ultraView™
Universal Red, Ventana Medical Systems). The slides
were pre-treated with standard cell conditioning using
CC1 buffer and incubated for 60 minutes with the rabbit
polyclonal primary antibody (1:150, Cayman Chemical).
Hematoxylin II and Bluing Reagent (Ventana Medical
Systems) were used as counterstains. Experiment included
normal salivary gland as an external positive control
tissue. Negative controls were performed by replacing the
primary antibody with corresponding rabbit IgG.
The TMA slides were digitized with an automated
whole slide scanner (Mirax Scan, Zeiss, Göttingen,
Germany), using a 20 x objective (numerical aperture 0.75)
and a Sony DFW-X710 camera with a 1024 x 768 pixel
CCD sensor (Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The pixel
resolution was 0.26 μm. The images were compressed to
a wavelet file format (Enhanced Compressed Wavelet,
ECW, ER Mapper, Erdas Inc, Atlanta, Georgia) with a
conservative compression ratio of 1:5. The compressed
virtual slides were uploaded to a web server (http://
fimm.webmicroscope.net) running image server software
(Image Web Server, Erdas Inc, Atlanta, Georgia).
The expression of PLA2G7 was evaluated by
the pathologists (A.S., S.N., T.M.) blinded to the
clinicopathological data at the time of scoring. Disease
specific survival was defined as the time from diagnosis
to the time of death due to prostate cancer. Patients who
died of intercurrent causes were censored. Survival curves
were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and patient

METHODS
Clinical prostate cancer samples
Samples from 453 prostate cancer patients treated
with total prostatectomy between the years 1982 and 1998
at the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland, were
included in this study. The allowance was obtained from
the local ethical committee and all tissue samples were
acquired and used according to contemporary regulatory
guidelines. Median age of the patients at diagnosis was
63 (44 – 83) years. None of the patients had received
adjuvant therapy before or immediately after the surgery.
Histopathological features were re-viewed using the
corresponding haematoxylin and eosin or herovici stained
slides by two experienced pathologists (A.S. and S.N.),
and clinical follow-up information was collected from
patient files. Median tumour area (the percentage of

and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0) at concentration levels of 0.10.2 μg / sample. The samples were vortexed for 2 min,
incubated 30 min at RT and centrifuged at 7800 g for 3
min.
After extraction, the lower phase (60 μl) was
separated and spiked with the labelled internal standard
mixture containing PC(16:1-D3/0:0), PC(16:1/16:1-D6)
and TG(16:0/16:0/16:0-13C3) at concentration level
of 0.1 μg/sample. Lipid extracts were analysed on a
Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with
an Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM (UPLCTM). The
column used was an Acquity UPLCTM BEH C18 2.1 ×
100 mm with 1.7 μm particles. The solvent system was
A) ultrapure water (1% 1 M NH4Ac, 0.1% HCOOH) and
B) LC/MS grade acetonitrile/isopropanol (1:1, 1% 1M
NH4Ac, 0.1% HCOOH) and the gradient started from
65% A / 35% B, reached 80% B in 2 min, 100% B in 7
min and remained there for 7 min. The flow rate was 0.400
ml/min and the injected aliquot 2.0 μl (Acquity Sample
Organizer, at 10 °C). Leucine enkephaline was used
as the lock spray reference compounds. The data were
collected at mass range of m/z 200-1,200 in negative ion
mode with scan duration of 0.2 s. The data were processed
using MZmine 2 software (http://mzmine.sourceforge.
net/) and the lipid identification was based on an internal
spectral library and tandem mass spectrometry. Protein
content of the samples was determined from the PBS
homogenate of the cells (5 μl) which was diluted further
for Micro BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford,
IL). Spectrophotometric determination was performed on
a Multiskan EX instrument (Thermo Scientific, Vantaa,
Finland), and the total protein content of the sample was
used in the normalization of the data.

TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
RNA samples extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen), were reversely transcripted to cDNA (High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied
Biosystems) and PCR reaction samples were analyzed in
96-well or 384-well format. TaqMan quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (Finnish DNA
Microarray Centre, Centre for Biotechnology, University
of Turku) was performed using ABI Prism 7900 (Applied
Biosystems) and quantitation was carried out using the
CT method with RQ manager 1.2 software (Applied
ΔΔ
Biosystems). At least two replicate samples were studied
for detection of target mRNA expression and β-actin was
used as an endogenous control. The primers and probes
were designed and selected with the help of Universal
ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center (Roche Diagnostics)
(Supplemental Table S4).

Immunofluorescence staining
For the immunofluorescence staining, 10 μM
lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC, 1-hexadecanoyl-snglycerol-3-phosphorylcholine; Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI) was added to the siRNA transfected cells at 24
h time point. Cells were fixed at 72 h time point with 4 %
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2
% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3 % BSA / PBS. Cells
were stained with Alexa conjugated Phalloidin (1:100,
Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), nuclei with Vectashield
