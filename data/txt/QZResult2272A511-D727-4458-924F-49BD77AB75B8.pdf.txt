ABSTRACT
We investigated the efficacy of targeting the PIM kinase pathway in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. We provide evidence that inhibition of PIM,
with the pan-PIM inhibitor SGI-1776, results in suppression of classic PIM effectors
and also elements of the mTOR pathway, suggesting interplay between PIM and
mTOR signals. Our data demonstrate that PIM inhibition enhances the effects of
imatinib mesylate on Ph+ leukemia cells. We also found that PIM inhibition results in
suppression of leukemic cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis of Ph+ leukemia
cells, including those resistant to imatinib mesylate. Importantly, inhibition of PIM
results in enhanced suppression of primary leukemic progenitors from patients with
CML. Altogether these findings suggest that pharmacological PIM targeting may
provide a unique therapeutic approach for the treatment of Ph+ leukemias.

Notably, over 90 mutations have been already identified
in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain [3, 4] and it is possible
that additional ones will be identified with time. Options
for patients with CML in whom multiple TKIs have failed
include recently FDA approved drugs ponatinib and
omacetaxine mepesuccinate [5–8]. However, significant
adverse effects have been reported with these latter agents,
and a significant number of patients treated with ponatinib
have developed severe thrombosis and/or vascular occlusive
disease [5, 9]. These difficulties in the management of
patients with refractory Ph+ leukemias underscore the need
to develop novel agents and unique therapeutic approaches
to overcome resistance to BCR-ABL1 TKIs.
One pathway that has attracted attention for
anticancer drug development is the proviral insertion site
in Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinase pathway
[10, 11]. To date, three PIM kinases (PIM1, PIM2, and

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) evolves from
abnormal hematopoietic stem cells of myeloid origin. Its
signature characteristic is the genetic translocation, t(9;22)
(q34;q11) BCR-ABL1, also known as the Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph+) [1, 2]. This abnormality is found in
about 90 to 95% of CML, approximately 25% of adult acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 3 to 4% of cases of
pediatric ALL [1, 2]. The treatment of CML with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) changed the way we approach the
management of Ph (+) leukemias, and heralded a new era
of clinical oncology with implications in many different
fields. However, despite success with TKIs, some patients
with early phase CML and the great majority of those with
advanced disease develop resistance and/or intolerance
to therapy, and represent a significant clinical challenge.

PIM3) have been identified, and are characterized by
substantial amino acid homology, as well as increased
protein expression in different malignancies [10, 11].
Increased PIM kinase expression has been reported in
prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic
lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma [10–12]. In addition, previous studies have
shown that there may be functional redundancies of
the different PIM genes, as PIM1-/- mice do not have a
significant phenotype [13] compared with PIM1/2/3 -/mice [14]. Furthermore, loss of PIM1 in a lymphoma
mouse model resulted in upregulation of PIM2 [15].
Thus, treatment of malignancies using agents with panPIM inhibitory properties may be important in hindering
potential compensatory effects and optimizing responses.
Although not yet well understood, the PIM kinase
pathway is involved in the regulation or transmission of
many signals that lead to leukemogenesis. For example,
PIM-mediated phosphorylation of histone 3 at serine 10
increases MYC-dependent transcription of genes such as
MCL-1 [12, 16]. Cell cycling is increased by PIM kinases
phosphorylating cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (p21
and p27) and phosphatases (cdc25a and cdc25c) [17–20].
PIM kinases promote cell survival by phosphorylation of
BAD at Ser112 [21–23]. Another mechanism by which
PIM kinases are involved in leukemogenesis appears
to involve cross-talk with the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. PIM1 has been shown to
directly phosphorylate PRAS40 at Thr246 [24], while
there is evidence that PIM2 is upstream of mTORC1 and
regulates its activity by phosphorylating TSC2 [25].
In the present study, we sought to test the efficacy
of PIM inhibition alone or in combination with imatinib
mesylate on Ph+ leukemia cells. Our data shows that
inhibition of PIM, with the pan-PIM inhibitor SGI-1776,
results in suppression of the mTOR pathway as well as other
downstream effectors. We also found reduced leukemic
cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of
colony formation in Ph+ cell lines including those resistant
to imatinib. In imatinib-sensitive cell lines, an enhanced
effect was seen when combining inhibition of PIM with
imatinib. Moreover, we establish that PIM inhibition results
in suppressive effects on primary leukemic progenitors from
CML patients, further suggesting a potential role for PIM
targeting as a novel therapeutic approach for Ph+ leukemias.

levels of expression of PIM1 compared to wild-type
BV173 cells (Figure 1A). All 3 isoforms of PIM2 (34, 37,
and 40 kDa isoforms) were expressed in K562 and KT1
cells, while BV173 and BV173R cells mainly expressed
2 isoforms; 37 and 40 kDa [10, 11] (Figure 1A). PIM3
was mainly expressed in K562 and KT1 cells, and to a
lesser extent in BV-173 cells (Figure 1 A). Taken together,
these findings suggested that pan-PIM inhibition would
be important for induction of antileukemic responses, as
PIM kinases have functional redundancies and the ability
to compensate for each other [13–15].
We subsequently examined the effects of SGI-1776
on downstream components of the PIM kinase pathway.
Treatment with SGI-1776 inhibited the phosphorylation
of histone 3 on serine 10 and as well as Mcl-1 expression
(Figure 1B). When the effects of SGI-1776 on components
of the mTOR pathway were assessed, we found that the
phosphorylation of several mTOR effectors was inhibited
in the different cell lines. Specifically, phosphorylation
of p70S6 kinase at Thr389, ribosomal protein S6
ser235/236, 4E-BP1 at Thr 37/46, (Figure 1C), as well as
phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473 and PRAS40 on Thr246
(Figure 1D) were significantly inhibited by SGI-1776.
The potent inhibitory effects of SGI-1776 on PIM
effectors and elements of the mTOR pathway suggested
potential cross-talk between PIM- and mTOR-mediated
signals in BCR-ABL1 transformed cells. This led us to
determine whether there is inhibition at the level of capdependent mRNA translation. To assess whether PIM
inhibition resulted in inhibitory effects on cap-dependent
mRNA translation, polysomal fractionation analysis was
carried out. SGI-1776 treatment of KT1 cells treatment
resulted in marked suppression of polysomal peaks
(Figure 2A, left panel). Furthermore, the area under the
curve (comparison of the polysomal profiles) indicated over
two-fold reduction in polysomal fractions (Figure 2A, right
panel). We also examined whether SGI-1776 modulates
polysomal mRNA levels for cyclin D1 (CCND1), a gene
encoding for a protein that promotes cell proliferation and
is highly expressed in different malignancies [27]. Realtime qRT-PCR assays demonstrated a significant SGI1776-dependent reduction of polysome-associated CCND1
transcript levels in KT1 cells (Figure 2B), consistent with
inhibitory effects on CCND1 mRNA translation.
PIM kinases promote cell cycling, proliferation, and
cell survival [10–12]. We therefore determined whether
PIM inhibition results in growth inhibitory/cytotoxic
effects in the Ph+ leukemia cell lines. In WST-1 viability
assays, we found that the IC50 values of inhibition by
treatment with SGI-1776 were 3.5 μmol/L and 5 μmol/L
for K562 and KT1 cells, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B).
We also examined the effects of the inhibitor on BV173
cells and BV173 cells harboring the T315I mutation
(BV173R). The IC50 value for wild-type BV173 was
2.5 μmol/L versus 3.5 μmol/L for BV173R (Figure 3C).
The IC50 values were comparable, suggesting that PIM

of all 3 PIM kinases in K562, KT1, BV173, and BV173R
cell lines, by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 1A,
different patterns of expression of PIM isoforms were
noticeable in the different lines. PIM1 was expressed in
all lines (Figure 1A). KT1 cells expressed both isoforms
of PIM1, 34 and 44 kDa, [10, 11] while the T315I kinase
domain mutation cell line, BV173R [26], exhibited higher

domain mutation, there are other mutations that can cause
imatinib-resistance [3, 4]. We therefore further assessed
the effects of SGI-1776 on cell viability of Ba/F3 cells
expressing mutants for 3 other commonly seen mutations,

All cell lines were sensitive to SGI-1776, suggesting that
treatment with SGI-1776 is effective in reducing cell
viability in TKI-resistant cells expressing distinct BCRABL mutations.
We next sought to determine whether the
combination of SGI-1776 with imatinib mesylate
exhibits more potent effects than each agent alone.
The combination of imatinib mesylate with low
concentrations of SGI-1776 resulted in more potent
suppression of the phosphorylation of the downstream
mTOR substrates, ribosomal protein S6 at ser235/236 and
p70 S6 kinase at Thr389 (Figure 4A and 4B). SGI-1776
also suppressed K562- and LAMA-84-derived leukemic

progenitor colony formation (Figure 4C and 4E), while
there was an enhanced inhibition of colony formation by
combining SGI-1776 with imatinib mesylate (Figure 4C
and 4E). Interestingly, there was noticeable reduction in
leukemic progenitor colony size by SGI-1776 treatment
of cells (Figure 4D). When the effects of SGI-1776
and imatinib mesylate on apoptosis were examined, we
found significant induction of apoptosis in K562 cells
by treatment with either SGI-1776 or imatinib mesylate,
but such apoptotic cell death was further enhanced by the
combination of the two agents (Figure 4F and 4G).
In further studies, we examined the antileukemic
effects of two pan-PIM inhibitors, SGI-1776 and AZD-1208,

on primitive leukemic progenitors from patients with
CML. There was significant reduction of primary leukemic
CFU-GM progenitor colony formation by either SGI-1776
(1 μmol/L) (Figure 5A) or AZD-1208 (1 μmol/L)
(Figure 5C). When lower concentrations of SGI-1776

colony formation when comparing control with SGI-1776

in combination (Figure 5B). Importantly, an enhanced
reduction in colony formation was seen at very low doses
of SGI-1776 (0.5 μmol/L) when combined with imatinib
mesylate (Figure 5B). Notably, SGI-1776 and AZD-1208
were extremely potent in suppressing colony formation
in primary CML patient-derived leukemic progenitors at
significantly lower doses when compared to K562 and
LAMA-84 cell lines (Figure 5B).

targets and elements of the mTOR pathway, suggesting
interplay between PIM and mTOR signaling in the context
of BCR-ABL1 transformation.
Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been shown
to be activated in CML [26, 35]. Previous studies have
also shown that PIM kinases activate mTORC1 signaling
through phosphorylation and inhibition of the negative
regulators of the pathway, TSC2 and PRAS40 [24, 25, 31].
The phosphorylation of these substrates was significantly
inhibited by SGI-1776, supporting a regulatory
involvement of PIM kinase activity on mTORC1
engagement, likely similar to what is observed in AML
[31]. In our studies, the phosphorylation of AKT at
Ser473 by mTORC2 is inhibited by SGI-1776 suggesting
a potential regulatory effect of PIM kinases on mTORC2.
The potential mechanism by which PIM kinases modulate
mTORC2 is unknown at this time and should be the focus
of future studies. Altogether, our data clearly establish that
SGI-1776 significantly inhibits components of the mTOR
pathway in Ph+ cell lines.
Importantly, our studies demonstrate that
PIM kinase inhibition of mTORC1 signals results
in negative regulatory effects on mRNA translation
of genes encoding for mitogenic proteins in BCRABL transformed cells, as evidenced by the effects
on leukemic polysomal profiles and the inhibition of
mRNA translation of the Cyclin D1 gene, providing a
mechanism or generation of growth inhibitory responses
by PIM inhibition. Moreover, our data establish that PIM
activity plays an important role in survival of BCR-ABL1
transformed cells, as shown by the induction of leukemic
cell apoptosis in response to PIM pharmacological
targeting. A possible mechanism for the induction of
apoptosis may involve modulating phosphorylation of

DISCUSSION
The PIM kinase pathway involves many
signaling elements that play roles in the regulation of
leukemogenesis [12, 28–31]. Because of their important
roles in malignant cell proliferation and survival, PIM
kinases are attractive therapeutic targets. It was previously
shown that PIM1 was important for BCR-ABL1-mediated
transformation [32]. Ph+ cell lines have been shown to
have an increased half-life of PIM1 leading to an increase
in PIM1 expression [33]. In addition, there is some
evidence that RNAi-targeting of PIM1 and PIM2 impairs
survival of hematopoietic cells transformed by oncogenic
protein tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL1 [34]. In
the present study, we demonstrate that pharmacological
inhibition of PIM kinases blocks both classical PIM

histone H3 on serine 10 that leads to effects on MYCdependent transcription [16]. Consistent with this
hypothesis we have found that treatment of different
Ph+ leukemia cell lines with the PIM inhibitor SGI1776 results in inhibition of phosphorylation of histone
H3 on Ser10. Taken together with previous studies that
showed similar effects in AML [29] but not in CLL cell
lines [28], our findings raise the possibility of specific
function of the PIM pathway in myeloid cells. Consistent
with an effect of SGI-1776 on MYC-dependent
transcription we also see reduction in the level of
protein expression of the MYC-dependent gene, MCL-1.
MCL-1 has been shown to promote survival in BCRABL1 transformed cells [36, 37]. Notably, other studies
have established PIM inhibition-dependent decrease in
expression of MCL-1 [12, 28, 29].
Finally, we provide direct evidence that PIM
inhibition results in potent suppression of primitive
leukemic progenitors from patients with CML and
enhances antileukemic responses to imatinib mesylate
in vitro. Notably, pharmacological PIM inhibition appears
to exhibit activity against T315I-BCR-ABL1-expressing
cells, suggesting that targeting the PIM kinase pathway
may provide an approach to overcome resistance to
tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML. Future studies to test
PIM inhibitors in in vivo mouse models of CML or Ph+
ALL, especially imatinib resistant models, is warranted
and may have important clinical-translational implications
for the treatment of CML and Ph+ ALL.

These assays were performed essentially as
previously described [39]. Briefly, cells were plated in
triplicate in 96 well plates and allowed to incubate for
4 days with increasing concentrations of SGI-1776. Cell
viability was assessed by adding WST-1 (Roche) to each
well according to the manufacturer’s instructions and was
measured using an Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer
(BioTek). IC50 curves were generated using Prism
GraphPad 6.0.

Clonogenic leukemic progenitor assays in
methylcellulose
These assays were performed essentially as in our
previous studies [26]. Peripheral blood or bone marrow
samples were obtained from patients with CML after
obtaining informed consent approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Northwestern University. Mononuclear
cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma Aldrich)
sedimentation. To assess the effects of drugs on leukemic
progenitor (CFU-L) colony formation, cells were then
plated in methylcellulose (MethoCult™ H4534 Classic
without EPO, Stem Cell Technologies).

Polysomal profiling and fractionation
Briefly, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) with 100 μg/ml
cycloheximide and then lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton
X 100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
2.5  mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KCl 100 μg/ml cycloheximide,
2 mM DTT, protease inhibitor and 1U/μl RNase inhibitor).
Lysates were then centrifuged at 12000g for 5 minutes at 4°C
and supernatants were collected and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. To isolate ribosomal fractions, lysates were layered
on a sucrose gradient of 5 to 50%. Samples were centrifuged
at 4°C for 110 minutes at 35000 rpm in a Beckman SW41-Ti
rotor. The absorbance was measured at 254 nm continuously
in an ISCO density gradient fractionator with the following
settings: pump speed, 0.80 ml/min; fraction size, 10 drops
per fraction; chart speed, 300 cm per hour; sensitivity, 1;
peak separator, off; noise filter, 0.5 seconds. A 5% sucrose
solution was used to set the baseline in an UA-6 detector for
all experiments. Polysomal RNA from the fractions were
isolated using a Qiagen AllPrep RNA/Protein kit. RNA was
reverse transcribed using oligodT primers and the Qiagen
Omniscript RT PCR kit, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative real-time (RT) PCR was carried out
by using validated Taqman FAM-labeled probes, and Taqman
PCR master mix (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The probes used were as follows:
GAPDH, Hs99999905_m1; Cyclin D1, Hs00765553_m1.
GAPDH was used for normalization as indicated, and results
were plotted as a ratio of Cyclin D1/GAPDH.

2 trial of ponatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive
leukemias. N Engl J Med. 2013; 369:1783–1796.

Briefly, either 1 or 2 x 105 of K562 or KT1 cells were
plated per well and treated for 24 hours with SGI-1776,
imatinib mesylate, or SGI-1776 plus imatinib mesylate.
Samples were stained with Annexin V and 4′-6-diamidino2-phenylindol (DAPI)-DNA stain according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence
was measured on stained cells using a LSRFortessa
Analyzer (BD Biosciences). Data was analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
