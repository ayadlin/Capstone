Abstract
The poor prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) routinely treated with ionizing radiation (IR) has been attributed to
the relative radioresistance of glioma-initiating cells (GIC). Other studies indicate that although GIC are sensitive,
the response is mediated by undeﬁned factors in the microenvironment. GBM produce abundant transforming
growth factor-b (TGF-b), a pleotropic cytokine that promotes effective DNA damage response. Consistent with
this, radiation sensitivity, as measured by clonogenic assay of cultured murine (GL261) and human (U251,
U87MG) glioma cell lines, increased by approximately 25% when treated with LY364947, a small-molecule
inhibitor of TGF-b type I receptor kinase, before irradiation. Mice bearing GL261 ﬂank tumors treated with 1D11,
a pan-isoform TGF-b neutralizing antibody, exhibited signiﬁcantly increased tumor growth delay following
IR. GL261 neurosphere cultures were used to evaluate GIC. LY364947 had no effect on the primary or secondary
neurosphere-forming capacity. IR decreased primary neurosphere formation by 28%, but did not reduce
secondary neurosphere formation. In contrast, LY364947 treatment before IR decreased primary neurosphere
formation by 75% and secondary neurosphere formation by 68%. Notably, GL261 neurospheres produced
3.7-fold more TGF-b per cell compared with conventional culture, suggesting that TGF-b production by GIC
promotes effective DNA damage response and self-renewal, which creates microenvironment-mediated resistance. Consistent with this, LY364947 treatment in irradiated GL261 neurosphere-derived cells decreased DNA
damage responses, H2AX and p53 phosphorylation, and induction of self-renewal signals, Notch1 and CXCR4.
These data motivate the use of TGF-b inhibitors with radiation to improve therapeutic response in patients with
GBM. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4119–29. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a signiﬁcant therapeutic challenge that poses an unmet medical need. Despite
advances in radiation therapy and improvements in chemotherapeutics and targeted therapies, outcomes remain
poor, with a median survival of 14.6 months when current
standard of care, such as concurrent chemoradiation therapy
and adjuvant chemotherapy, are used (1). Although the exact
origin of GBM (and other malignant brain tumors) is unknown,
it is hypothesized that a fraction of tumor cells have cancer
stem cell characteristics (glioma-initiating cells, GIC) and true
tumorigenic potential (2, 3). Originally proposed 25 years ago
(4), it is generally hypothesized that the resistance of GIC
contributes to the poor response to radiation and chemotherAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Departments of Radiation Oncology and 2Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York; and

apy and inevitable tumor recurrence (reviewed in ref. 5). The
exact mechanism of treatment resistance is unknown; however, GIC's intrinsic hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt and PTEN
pathways (6, 7) and increased activation of DNA damage
checkpoint pathways (8) are expected to contribute.
The microenvironment, in addition, can contribute to radiation responses (reviewed in ref. 9). Toﬁlon and colleagues
showed that GBM cells irradiated under orthotopic conditions
have a greater capacity to repair DNA double-strand breaks
than GBM cells irradiated in vitro (10). A critical component of
the GBM microenvironment is the pleotropic cytokine transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b). TGF-b has a range of effects
on the glioma microenvironment, including extracellular
matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and invasion (reviewed in
ref. 11). Both TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 have been implicated in
autocrine tumor growth regulation (12). TGF-b2 is overexpressed in gliomas (13). Higher levels of TGF-b1 have been
found in anaplastic gliomas (WHO grade III) than in GBM
(WHO grade IV), indicating a potential role of TGF-b1 in the
early stages of tumorigenesis (14).
The TGF-b family has been shown to play a role in both
pluripotent stem cells (reviewed in ref. 15) and neural stem
cells speciﬁcally (16). In addition, TGF-b has been implicated
in GIC biology. Penuelas et al. showed that exposure of

patient-derived tumor neurospheres to TGF-b increased the
number of neurospheres in a dose-dependent fashion, and
injection of these neurospheres into mice resulted in earlier
appearance of more aggressive tumors (17). Ikushima and
colleagues reported that autocrine TGF-b contributes to the
tumorigenicity of the GIC population by activation of Sox4 and
Sox2 (18). More recently, Seone and colleagues showed that
TGF-b inhibitors affect a CD44high/Id1high GIC population via
Id1 and Id3, which they propose controls the "master regulators" of the TGF-b–GIC gene program, including leukemia
inhibitory factor (LIF), Sox2, Sox4, and CD44 (19).
Ionizing radiation (IR) induces TGF-b in vitro and in vivo in
both normal and cancer cells (20–22). We have shown previously that reactive oxygen species are possibly involved in the
radiation-induced activation of TGF-b (23) and the process is
mediated by a conformational change in latency-associated
peptide (LAP)–TGF-b complex, allowing the release of active
TGF-b1 (24). Our studies and others have directly linked TGF-b
to DNA damage responses and radiosensitivity (25, 26). Inhibiting TGF-b decreases radiation-induced phosphorylation
of p53, chk2, H2AX, and rad17, all of which are substrates of
ataxia telangectasia mutated (ATM), a kinase critical in the
molecular response to IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks.
ATM, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3kinase) family, is hypothesized to be a master controller of
cell-cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that are required for
cell response to DNA damage and for genome stability. Moreover, there is evidence using proteomic proﬁling that prolonged TGF-b treatment of cells can affect DNA damage repair
such as Rad51 in a Smad-dependent manner (27). Notably,
breast cancer cell lines treated with a small-molecule TGF-b
type I receptor kinase inhibitor showed increased radiosensitivity as measured by clonogenic assay and decreased DNA
damage responses to radiation, including nuclear foci of the
histone variant H2AX, regardless of sensitivity to TGF-b growth
control. A syngeneic model of triple-negative breast cancer
showed increased tumor growth delay in response to single or
fractionated radiation treatment with the addition of TGF-b
neutralizing antibodies during radiotherapy (28).
The current study was aimed at determining the effects of
TGF-b inhibition on radiation sensitivity of the GIC population. To assess the therapeutic potential of TGF-b inhibition during radiotherapy, we determined the relationship
between sensitivity to TGF-b-mediated growth inhibition,
GIC formation, molecular responses to radiation, and radiosensitivity in human and murine GBM in vitro and in vivo.
We determined that neurosphere cultures, compared with
bulk populations, produce more TGF-b, whose inhibition
signiﬁcantly compromises both DNA damage response and
self-renewal of GIC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The murine glioma, GL261 (obtained from the National
Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Tumor Repository,
Frederick, MD; authenticated in 2012 by Idexx Radil) and
human glioma U251 (a generous gift of Dr. Kevin Camphausen;

4120

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

authenticated in 2010 by Idexx Radil) cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) GlutaMAX (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% pyruvate
(Gibco). Human glioma U87MG [obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in 2011] cells were cultured
in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS,
at 37 C with 5% CO2. All cell lines were tested for Mycoplasma
and were found negative (Cellshipper Mycoplasma test;
Bionique).
For cell proliferation experiments, cells were cultured in 10%
serum replacement medium (SRM; Knockout SR, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing either 2 ng/mL TGF-b1 (R&D Systems), 400 nmol/L small-molecule inhibitor of the TGF-b type I
receptor kinase, LY364947 ([3-(pyridin-2-yl)-4-(4-quinonyl)]
(4)-1H-pyrazole; Lilly designation HTS466284; Calbiochem),
10 mg/mL of 1D11, a pan-isoform, neutralizing TGF-b monoclonal antibody, or 13C4, a murine monoclonal isotype control
antibody (kindly provided by Genzyme Inc.). Cells were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter counter at 24 and 48 hours
post-treatment.
Mink lung cell luciferase assay
To measure secreted active and latent TGF-b in conditioned media, luciferase induction by conditioned media was
measured in the mink lung epithelial cells transfected with
truncated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter fused
to the ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene as previously described
(29). Active TGF-b was measured directly in untreated samples, whereas total TGF-b (active and latent) was measured
following heat activation at 80 C for 5 minutes (30). Unconditioned media was used as a control in all experiments,
which was subtracted, and each condition was repeated in the
presence of pan-speciﬁc TGF-b neutralizing antibody to
conﬁrm speciﬁcity. All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and results represent the mean measured value per 106
cultured cells.
Neurosphere assay
Cells were diluted in serum-free growth medium (1,000
cells/mL) and plated in 500 mL in non–adherent 24-well
plates (Corning-Costar). Cells were fed with 125 mL of serumfree growth medium every other day for 14 days. The culture
medium consisted of serum-free DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10 U/mL heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2%
B27 (Invitrogen), human recombinant ﬁbroblast growth
factor 2 (FGF-2, 20 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and epidermal
growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). After 14 days,
spheres were measured, and those >100 mm were counted as
a neurosphere-forming unit. To generate secondary neurospheres, primary neurospheres were gently centrifuged,
mechanically dissociated, and then incubated with trypsin
at 37 C for 5 minutes. After centrifugation and washing with
PBS, cells were diluted using neurosphere media to 1,000
cells/mL and plated onto non–adherent 24-well plates, as
described above. Spheres were counted and measured from
6 different wells for each experiment. Data on the neurosphere number and size are the average  SE of 3 independent experiments consisting of 3 replicates.

Microenvironment-Mediated Radiation Resistance

Clonogenic assay
To assess clonogenic survival of cells in monolayer culture,
human and murine glioma cell lines were grown for 48 hours to
70% conﬂuence, wherein cells were incubated with serum
replacement media containing 400 nmol/L of LY364947 kinase
inhibitor or 10 mg/mL pan-speciﬁc TGF-b-neutralizing antibody 1D11 or control antibody 13C4 for 48 h before and 3 h post
radiation exposure. Cells were irradiated with 1 to 8 Gy using a
Varian Clinac 2300 C/D linear accelerator (Varian), trypsinized
3 hours post-irradiation, and plated in triplicates at 3 dilutions
into 6-well cell culture plates in serum-containing media.
Colonies were allowed to grow for 10 to 12 days followed by
ﬁxing and staining with crystal violet. Colonies containing >50
cells were counted to determine percent survival and the
number of colonies obtained from 3 replicates was averaged
for each treatment. These mean values were corrected according to plating efﬁciency of respective controls to calculate cell
survival for each dose level.
To assess clonogenic survival of cells in neurosphere culture,
neurospheres were cultured for 14 days under the neurosphere
conditions described above, then treated with 400 nmol/L of
LY364947 kinase inhibitor for 48 before and 3 hours post
irradiation (2 Gy). Cells were centrifuged, media aspirated,
and plated in triplicate at 3 dilutions into 6-well cell culture
plates in serum-containing media. The remainder of the assay
was conducted as described above.
Western blotting
To examine the DNA damage response and TGF-b signaling,
5  105 cells were grown in complete media for 48 hours,
followed by LY364947 treatment (400 nmol/L) in 10% SRM for
24 hours. The cells were irradiated with 5 Gy and lysed after 1
hour, or treated with 500 pg/mL TGF-b and lysed after 30
minutes. Thereafter, the extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with one of the primary antibodies: phosphoSmad2 on serine 465/467 at 1:500 (clone 138D4, CAT#3108, Cell
Signaling), Smad2/3 at 1:500 (CAT#610842, Becton Dickinson
Transduction Laboratories), phospho-p53 on serine 15 at 1:500
(CAT#92845, Cell Signaling), p53 at 1:500 (Clone Ab-8,
CAT#MS-738-P, Neomarkers and CAT#554157, Becton Dickinson Biosciences), ATM serine1981 phosporylation at 1:500
(CAT#2152-1, Epitomics), and ATM, clone 2C1 at 1:500
(CAT#GTX70103, GeneTex). Protein estimation was carried
out using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). One hundred
microgram of protein was electrophoresed on a 4% to 15%
gradient gel (BioRad) and transblotted on polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) Immobilion-FL membrane (Millipore Corporation). The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer and
probed with a primary antibody. The membrane was washed 3
times for 10 minutes with 0.1% Tris-buffered saline Tween 20
(TBST), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies
(goat anti-mouse, CAT#926-32220 and goat anti-rabbit,
CAT#926-32211, Odyssey) for 1 hours at room temperature.
The membrane was washed 3 times for 10 minutes with TBST
0.1% and scanned on the Odyssey LICOR system. Using ImageJ
1.45s software (NIH), the raw integrated density was measured
for each band of the protein of interest in all 3 cell lines. After
correction for loading using actin, the ratio of phosphorylated

www.aacrjournals.org

to total protein was determined, normalized to the control
group, and represented as fold change from the control group.
Representative ﬁgures are displayed in grayscale.
Comet assay
The persistence of DNA damage following fractionated
irradiation on neurosphere cultures was assessed by CometAssay. Neurospheres were cultured and treated with 400
nmol/L of LY364947 kinase inhibitor as described above and
irradiated with 2 Gy for 3 consecutive days beginning on day 10
in culture. Neurospheres were dissociated and harvested 24 h
following the third fraction. Single-cell gel electrophoresis
at 19 V (300 mAMP, 40 min) was conducted by Alkaline
CometAssay (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. SYBR Green-stained DNA comets were imaged
at 100 magniﬁcation and the extent of DNA breaks was
quantiﬁed as tail moment using CometScore software.
Immunoﬂuorescence
GL261, U251, and U87MG cells (2  104) were grown in
chamber slides in complete media for 48 hours, followed by
LY364947 treatment (400 nmol/L) in 10% SRM for 24 hours
before 2 Gy radiation. GL261-derived neurospheres, tumor
cryosections or cells prepared as described above were ﬁxed
using 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 100% methanol for 20
minutes at 20 C. Then, specimens were blocked with the
supernatant of 0.5% casein/PBS, stirred for 1 hours, incubated
with mouse detective antigen (Biocare Medical) for an additional 3 h for murine glioma tumors, and incubated with a
mouse monoclonal gH2AX antibody (clone JBW301, Upstate
Biotechnology; Charlottesville, VA) at 1:500, rabbit monoclonal
phospho-serine 465/467 Smad2 antibody at 1:100 (clone 138D4,
CAT#3108, Cell Signaling), goat polyclonal CXCR4antibody
(CAT# ab1670, Abcam) at 1:300, or rabbit monoclonal Notch1antibody (CAT# ab8925, Abcam) at 1:100, overnight at 4 C,
followed by washes and incubation with Alexa-488- or Alexa594-labeled anti-mouse/anti-rabbit/anti-goat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 hours at room temperature.
Specimens were counter-stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and washed in PBS-Tween20 0.1% before
mounting with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs).
Specimens were imaged using a 40 objective with 0.95
numerical aperture Zeiss Plan-Apochromat objective on a
Zeiss Axiovert (Zeiss) equipped with epiﬂuorescence. All
images were acquired with a CCD Hamamatsu Photonics
(Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany) monochrome camera
at 1392  1040 pixel size, 12 bits per pixel (bpp) depth and
assembled as false-color images using the Metamorph imaging
platform (Molecular Devices, Inc.). Foci were enumerated as
previously described (31).
In vivo tumor studies
Animal studies were conducted using protocols that had
undergone institutional review and approval. Female C57/BL6
mice, age 6 to 8 weeks, obtained from Taconic were used for
animal experiments. Animals were housed in a temperaturecontrolled animal care facility with a 12-hour light–dark cycle

and allowed chow and water ad libitum. GL261 cells (106) were
injected into the right ﬂank of mice and allowed to grow. After
the tumors reached an average size of 140 mm3, animals (n ¼
10 in each group) were randomized to receive 1D11 TGF-b
neutralizing antibody or 13C4 control antibody (10 mg/kg,
intraperitoneal injection). Twenty-four hours later, tumors
were irradiated with a dose of 6 Gy using a Varian Clinac
2300 C/D linear accelerator ﬁtted with a 25-mm radiosurgery
conical collimator (BrainLAB AG). Superﬂab bolus (1.5-cm
tissue equivalent material) was placed over the tumor, and
a source-to-skin distance of 100 cm was set. Radiation was
delivered at 600 cGy/min with 6 MV X-rays. Mice were monitored thrice weekly for signs of toxicity, and tumor volumes
were measured with a caliper. Tumor volumes were calculated
as length  width2  0.52 with all measurements in millimeter.
Animals were sacriﬁced when tumors reached 10  10 mm in
two dimensions. Two hours before sacriﬁce, animals were
injected with pimonidazole (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal, HPI).
Tumors were harvested and portions were formalin ﬁxed and
frozen in O.C.T. (Sakura Tissue-Tek). All animal experiments
were carried out in accordance with guidelines speciﬁed by
New York University's institutional animal care and use committee. For analysis, each tumor was normalized to its pretreatment volume.

cance of the difference between the mean values for graded
doses of radiation in clonogenic assays, neurosphere formation,
and gH2AX foci quantiﬁcation was calculated by conducting a
one-way ANOVA test with Tukey post hoc test. ANOVA with the
Student Newman–Keuls Multiple Comparison posttest was
used to determine signiﬁcance between in vivo tumor growth
delay measured by time-to-reach 3 times the pretreatment
volume. A P value of <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Inhibition of TGF-b radiosensitizes glioma cells
In serum-free conditions, glioma murine GL261 and human
U251 and U87MG cell lines produced comparable amounts of
active and latent TGF-b; GL261 162.3  11.7 pg/mL and 477.6 
67.8 pg/mL; U251 123.1  15.0 pg/mL and 420.5  97.9 pg/mL;
U87MG 82.5  18.6 pg/mL and 350.5  144.2 pg/mL, respectively, and showed intact TGF-b signaling through Smad
phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Murine GL261 and human U251MG
cells were not responsive to growth modulation by exogenous
TGF-b or blockade of endogenous TGF-b signaling by the
addition of the TGF-b small-molecule inhibitor LY364947.
U87MG cells were growth inhibited by addition of TGF-b by
19.7%  8.8% at 24 h and 55.3%  9.3% at 48 h, an effect that was
reversed by the addition of the TGF-b small-molecule inhibitor

Regardless of TGF-b-mediated growth modulation, addition
of the TGF-b inhibitor LY364947 signiﬁcantly increased the

ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test). The dose-enhancement
ratio (DER) at 10% cell survival was 1.25 to 1.30, which
indicates that 25% less dose was necessary to kill 90% of the
cells by radiation when TGF-b signaling was blocked. In
addition, LY364947 signiﬁcantly decreased radiation-induced
phosphorylation of ATM Ser1981 and P53 Ser15 (Fig. 2A).
Consistent with prior studies in human and mouse epithelial
cells (25, 28), radiosensitization was correlated with signiﬁcantly fewer gH2AX foci, a marker of DNA damage response
(Fig. 2B). These data indicate that TGF-b inhibition in
glioma cells compromises the response to DNA damage and
increases radiosensitivity.

There are 3 pharmacologic routes to blocking TGF-b: neutralizing the ligand, inhibiting expression, and truncating the
signaling cascade (32). The pharmacokinetic properties of
antibody and small-molecule kinase inhibitors result in considerable differences in the duration of TGF-b signal modulation. Several TGF-b neutralizing antibodies that are in clinical
development have shown safety and efﬁcacy in ﬁbrotic disorders (32, 33). We compared in vitro efﬁcacy of TGF-b ligand
captured using 1D11 pan-TGF-b neutralizing antibodies to
that of LY364947 in monolayer GL261 cells. Pretreatment with
pan-speciﬁc TGF-b neutralizing antibody, 1D11, produced the
same level of radiosensitization as LY364947 (Fig. 3A; P ¼ 0.04,
ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test).

A, inhibition of TGF-b using a panspeciﬁc monoclonal antibody, 1D11, resulted in similar level of radiosensitization (1.22 at 10% cell survival) as seen with the use of the small-molecule inhibitor
LY364947. P ¼ 0.04, ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. B, treatment with 1D11 neutralizing antibody resulted in decreased gH2AX immunoﬂuorescence (green)

To test whether increased radiosensitivity conferred therapeutic beneﬁt, we established ﬂank tumors of GL261 cells
in C57bl mice. A single intraperitoneal injection of 1D11
antibody (10 mg/kg) did not affect tumor growth rate of
established tumors (150 mm3) compared with control–
antibody-treated mice. Immunohistochemical detection of
gH2AX in tumors harvested 1 h after radiation was reduced
in mice treated with 1D11 (Fig. 3B). Consistent with inhibition
of DNA damage recognition, the tumor growth delay of mice
treated with 1D11 injected 24 h before a single 6 Gy fraction
was signiﬁcantly increased compared with IR alone (Fig. 3C
and D).
Radiosensitivity of GL261 neurosphere formation
Tumor regrowth is hypothesized to be, in large part, due to
the relative response of GIC (5); therefore, we next examined
the effect of TGF-b on GL261 neurosphere-forming capacity as
a surrogate of GIC. Addition of LY364947 to GL261 neurosphere
cultures did not affect either primary or secondary neurosphere-forming capacity. Irradiation (2 Gy) of monolayer
GL261 cells signiﬁcantly decreased primary neurosphere-

forming capacity by 28% (P < 0.001; ANOVA). Addition of
TGF-b inhibitor LY364947 decreased primary neurosphere
formation by another 47% for a total reduction of 75% (Fig.
4A; P < 0.001; ANOVA). Surprisingly, irradiation of primary
neurospheres did not affect secondary neurosphere formation.
However, LY364947-treated, irradiated primary neurosphere
cultures showed signiﬁcantly decreased secondary neurosphere-forming capacity, leading to a 68% reduction (Fig.
4B; P < 0.001; ANOVA).
Given that secondary neurosphere formation, a measure of
GIC self-renewal, was resistant to radiation but the majority of
cells in a neurosphere are not GIC, we explored whether both
populations were afforded the same degree of resistance by
measuring clonogenic survival of GL261 cells dissociated from
treated neurospheres. Consistent with monolayer cultures,
radiation decreased colony-forming efﬁciency, and addition
of TGF-b inhibitor LY364947 further increased the radiosensitivity of these cells by a similar magnitude to the effect seen
in GL261 bulk culture. Irradiation (2 Gy) reduced the surviving
fraction by 43% and the addition of LY354947 further reduced
clonogenic survival by an additional 20% (Fig. 4C). Thus, non-

murine glioma cells were cultured under neurosphere conditions. A, treatment with LY364947 (24 hours, 400 nmol/L) alone had no effect on primary
neurosphere formation. Irradiation (2 Gy) decreased primary neurosphere-forming capacity by 28%, and LY364947 treatment for 24 hours before irradiation
decreased neurosphere formation by an additional 47%, resulting in 75% fewer neurospheres. B, treatment with LY364947 (24 hours, 400 nmol/L) alone had
no effect on secondary neurosphere formation. Irradiation of primary neurospheres had no effect on secondary neurosphere-forming capacity, yet LY364947
treatment of primary neurospheres before irradiation decreased secondary neurosphere formation by 68%. C, pretreatment with LY364947 for 24 hours
decreased neurosphere-derived clonogenic cell survival after irradiation (2 Gy). After 2 Gy irradiation, the survival fraction of untreated neurospheres

GICs were not afforded protection from IR in neurosphere
culture. These data support the contention that GIC are
speciﬁcally protected from radiation (8); however, this is
conditional, that is, speciﬁc to neurosphere culture.
TGF-b inhibition reduces DNA damage response in GL261
neurospheres and radiosensitizes the GIC population. We
hypothesized that lack of radiation effect on secondary neurosphere formation, which is indicative of self-renewal, would be
reﬂected in the DNA damage response. To test this hypothesis,
gH2AX foci induced by 2 Gy were measured at 30 minutes postradiation in GL261 neurospheres (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, we
observed that the number of foci per cell was 6 in neurospherederived cells versus 19 in monolayer culture at the same time
after the same dose. The difference between monolayer and
neurosphere culture could be a failure to recognize damage, a
more effective DNA damage response, or both (34). Nonetheless, addition of TGF-b inhibitor LY364947 in neurosphere
culture reduced radiation-induced gH2AX foci by 5.2-fold
(6.2 foci/nucleus compared with 1.2 foci/nucleus; Fig. 5B),
indicating that TGF-b inhibition compromised the molecular
recognition of DNA damage in this population, as well as in
GL261 bulk culture.

www.aacrjournals.org

These data indicate that DNA damage recognition is compromised and that fractionation, which is standard in radiotherapy,
would amplify this effect and further compromise DNA repair.
To test this hypothesis, we exposed GL261 neurospheres to
3 daily fractions of 2 Gy with or without LY364947 and conducted
comet assays to evaluate unresolved DNA damage at 24 h after
the ﬁnal dose (Fig. 5C). Radiation signiﬁcantly increased the
mean tail moment of cells isolated from neurospheres. The mean
of those treated with radiation and LY364947 was 19.8  17 SD
compared with 6  6 SD for fractionated radiation alone. Less
than 5% of non-irradiated cells had tail moments more than 10,
compared with 17% for those treated with fractionated radiation
and 64% of those from cells treated with the small-molecule
TGF-b signaling inhibition and fractionated radiation. These
data indicate that TGF-b inhibition not only compromises DNA
damage recognition but also prevents DNA repair.
Previously, our studies showed that Tgfb1 null cells fail to
mount the full DNA damage response and were radiosensitive
(25), as was observed by inhibiting TGF-b signaling in monolayer GBM cultures. Because GIC appeared to be radioresistant, but were sensitized by TGF-b blockade, we hypothesized
that increased TGF-b production and/or activity could

underlie their phenotype. Active and total TGF-b levels in
media conditioned for 72 hours from GL261 monolayers or
neurospheres were measured using the mink lung epithelial
cell luciferase assay. As previously reported, the TGF-b2 isoform accounts for 85% of total TGF-b produced by cells grown
under either condition, determined by isoform-speciﬁc neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). GL261 cells in neurosphere culture produced signiﬁcantly more (3.7-  1.4-fold, P <
0.001, ANOVA) total TGF-b and a trend toward more active
TGF-b (1.9-  1.5-fold, P > 0.05) than GL261 cells in monolayer
culture (Fig. 5D). Irradiation before treatment with conditioning media under either of the culture conditions did not
signiﬁcantly affect TGF-b levels. Thus, increased production
of TGF-b by GL261 neurospheres could be protective as
evidenced by a more effective molecular response to radiation-induced DNA damage leading to radiation resistance.
To test the idea that TGF-b inhibition affects GIC selfrenewal following IR, we examined CXCR4 and Notch1, which
have been implicated in GIC self-renewal pathways (35, 36).

Irradiation (2 Gy) of primary neurospheres signiﬁcantly
induced both markers, measured 3 hours following radiation
treatment, which was blocked by TGF-b inhibition with
LY364947 (Fig. 5E and F). Thus, we concluded that GIC are
protected from radiation-induced cell kill by increased TGF-b
production under conditions approximating the niche (i.e.,
neurosphere culture), which promotes effective DNA damage
response and self-renewal via CXCR4 and Notch 1. Inhibition of
TGF-b signaling compromises both mechanisms.

Discussion
GBM is a cancer characterized by a high degree of radioresistance, evidenced by inevitable local and/or disseminated
recurrence. Our study indicates that high TGF-b levels confer
resistance for both GIC and more differentiated tumor cells to
DNA damage. Tumors have been described as "wounds that do
not heal", whose considerable similarities with the process of
wound healing include TGF-b activity. Ionizing radiation is

Microenvironment-Mediated Radiation Resistance

certainly another source of injury to tumor cells and tumor
microenvironment, as well as surrounding normal tissue (20–
22, 37). Pharmaceutical TGF-b inhibition circumvents this
microenvironment-mediated protection by compromising
DNA damage recognition and, therefore, repair, as evidenced
by increased clonogenic cell death and unrepaired DNA measured by comet assay. The potential for beneﬁt is likely even
higher in situ, as there are multiple sources of TGF-b and
multiple modes of action of TGF-b besides the DNA damage
response on both cell behavior and tumor microenvironment.
Indeed, several studies have shown potential therapeutic beneﬁt for TGF-b inhibition in preclinical glioma models, including antiangiogenesis (38) and anti-invasion (39, 40).
Our previous work showed that genetic depletion of TGFb1 compromises the DNA damage response in vivo and in
vitro (25, 26), and we have now shown in vitro and in vivo
radiosensitization with TGF-b inhibitors in breast cancer
models (28). The negative impact of TGF-b on response to
radiation therapy has been observed in multiple tumor types,
further illustrating the well-established pleotropic effects of
this cytokine in the tumor microenvironment. The addition of
TGF-b inhibitors improves radiation response in preclinical
models of GBM (41, 42). Zhang and colleagues speciﬁcally
reported that the addition of the small-molecule inhibitor of
TGF-b receptor type I and II kinase, LY2109761, to the current
standard of care treatment, radiation and the oral alkylating
agent temozolomide, provided beneﬁt. In addition to radiosensitization and tumor growth delay, TGF-b-signaling blockade had antiangiogenic and antimigration effects as well.
Mengxian and colleagues similarly reported radiosensitization, tumor growth delay, and improved survival with the
addition of the same small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-b,
LY2109761, without combining with temozolomide. They
further showed that either TGF-b inhibition or radiation decreased self-renewal of glioma stem-like cells in a neurosphere assay, and a greater decrease was noted when these
were combined. Our study provides an explanation of these
ﬁndings in that autocrine TGF-b potentiates an effective molecular DNA damage response as well as self-renewal.
TGF-b inhibitors are already in phase II/III clinical trials for
ﬁbrosis (32, 33). Phase I/II clinical studies using the antisense
oligonucleotide AP-12009 (Antisense Pharma, Regensberg,
Germany) to target TGF-b2 in recurrent or refractory WHO
grade III or IV glioma showed prolonged survival when compared with historical controls (43). More recently, a randomized phase IIb study of AP-12009 in patients with recurrent or
refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma showed tumor
control rate superiority of lower dose AP-12009 over standard
chemotherapy in anaplastic astrocytoma and comparable
survival in GBM, with lower rates of toxicity observed with
AP-12009 compared with chemotherapy (44).
Our study includes several aspects that add signiﬁcantly to
the growing body of evidence indicating that TGF-b is a
therapeutic target in GBM. First, we used both a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-b type I receptor kinase, LY364947, as
well as a pan-speciﬁc TGF-b neutralizing antibody, 1D11, to
target the TGF-b pathway in combination with IR. Potential
advantages seen with clinical use of neutralizing antibodies to

www.aacrjournals.org

TGF-b or its receptor include their longer half-life and potentially more consistent inhibition than small-molecule inhibitors, as well as targeting of all 3 TGF-b isoforms that could be
beneﬁcial by affecting not only tumor cells but also the tumor
microenvironment. Although the blood–brain barrier does
prevent antibody entry into normal brain tissue, the situation
is much more complex in the setting of GBM, in which the
tumor itself can modulate the blood–brain barrier's permeability (45). Indeed, the pan-speciﬁc TGF-b neutralizing antibody 1D11 has been shown in preclinical orthotopic models to
concentrate intratumorally (46). Furthermore, the recent success with bevacizumab (Avastin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal
antibody), in both recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM, highlights the feasibility of therapeutic antibodies in CNS tumors
(reviewed in ref. 47). Although outcomes have improved,
concern over the altered pattern of relapse in patients with
bevacizumab-treated GBM, characterized by distant inﬁltration of the brain by tumors that show increased invasiveness,
has emerged (48). Combination therapy with strategies to
inhibit invasion have been proposed, and the TGF-b pathway
is a logical approach, given the documented role TGF-b plays in
glioma migration and invasion (11).
The magnitude of radiosensitization seen in the current
study (DER 1.25 by clonogenic assay) must be taken into
context of a disease as difﬁcult to treat as GBM. The DERs
currently reported are well within the level of radiosensitization seen in models of glioma. Zheng and colleagues used
siRNA silencing of TNF receptor-associated Factor 2 (TRAF2)
to radiosensitize U251 glioma cells in vitro with a DER of 1.2 to
1.39 (49). Golding and colleagues reported radiosensization
with DERs of 1.6 to 2.1 in vitro using ATM kinase inhibitors KU55933 in U87MG glioma cells (50) and KU-60019 in U1242
glioma cells (51). Our study showed that ATM kinase activity is
reduced with TGF-b inhibition. More importantly, Kil and
colleagues showed a DER of 1.32 using U251 glioma cells
treated with temozolomide (52). Considering that the addition
of temozolomide to radiation therapy in the treatment of GBM
was one of the largest breakthroughs in this disease in decades
and is now considered the standard of care, radiosensitization
of this magnitude reported here must be considered signiﬁcant, particularly because the radiation sensitivity of GIC
increased nearly 3-fold.
Debate exists about whether GIC are more (8) or less (53)
radioresistant than the tumor cell population as a whole,
but it is hypothesized that the GIC population contributes to
the inevitable recurrence of GBM (54). Several recent studies
have shown that the TGF-b pathway is important in GIC
biology (17–19). Although we did not observe inhibition of
neurosphere self-renewal with TGF-b inhibition alone (seen
in several of the abovementioned studies), we found that
TGF-b inhibition in combination with IR prevents selfrenewal mediated by CXCR4 and Notch1. These data resolve
the paradoxical literature as to GIC radiation sensitivity. We
postulate that TGF-b production in the GIC niche is evidence of microenvironment-mediated resistance, and as
such represents a very promising target to improve GBM
radiotherapy and provide multifaceted beneﬁts that could
prevent GBM recurrence.
