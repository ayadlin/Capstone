cancer cell lines may inhibit chemical- and radiation-induced
apoptosis (5, 6). Given the important role of chemotherapy for
treating cancers, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular
mechanism by which ARC influences chemotherapy.
Doxorubicin is the most widely used chemotherapeutic agent in
the treatment of human tumors. It has been well-documented that
doxorubicin exerts its death effects by inducing apoptosis.
Although doxorubicin may initiate apoptotic program by using
molecules such as p53, reactive oxygen species, and caspases (7, 8),
the detailed mechanism by which doxorubicin induces apoptosis
has not been fully clarified.
Apoptosis can be initiated through the extrinsic and/or the
intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is initiated through the
death receptors, whereas the intrinsic pathway is initiated through
mitochondria. A death signal can initiate apoptotic program by
inducing the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins such
as cytochrome c (9), apoptosis-inducing factor (10), and Smac/
Diablo (11, 12).
It has been recently shown that the mitochondrial morphology is
an important determinant of mitochondrial function (13). Mitochondrial fusion and fission participate in the regulation of
apoptosis. Mitochondrial fusion is able to inhibit apoptosis,
whereas mitochondrial fission is involved in the initiation of
apoptosis (14, 15). It remains largely unknown as to whether
doxorubicin triggers apoptosis through inducing mitochondrial
fission.
ARC is originally identified to be a caspase-inhibiting protein
and can specifically inhibit the activation of caspase-2 and caspase8, thereby blocking apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli
requiring the engagement of these caspases (1). Further studies
reveal that ARC may also elicit its antiapoptotic function by other
means. It can interact with Bax (16, 17), inhibit cytochrome c
release (18), and maintain mitochondrial membrane potential
(19, 20). Furthermore, ARC seems to be a calcium-binding protein
and can suppress the intracellular Ca2+ increase thereby blocking
Ca2+-mediated apoptosis (21). In addition, our previous work
shows that ARC is regulated by protein kinase CK2. CK2 can
phosphorylate ARC at threonine-149 enabling ARC translocation
from cytoplasm to mitochondria. ARC requires T149 phosphorylation to protect cells against oxidative stress–induced apoptosis
(22). Strikingly, ARC phosphorylation by CK2 is constitutive,
indicating the importance of phosphorylation for ARC function
(22, 23). Despite of these observations, it is not yet clear whether
ARC is able to regulate mitochondrial fission.
Mitochondrial fission requires the activity of a dynamin-related
protein-1 (Drp1; ref. 24). Drp1 is a GTPase that causes scission of
the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in fission of
mitochondrial tubules into fragments. Drp1 is responsible for
cytochrome c release and caspase activation (14). The introduction

Abstract
One obstacle of cancer therapy is the development of cancer
resistance to chemotherapy. The molecular mechanisms by
which the resistance is developed remain to be fully
understood. Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment
domain (ARC) is an endogenous antiapoptotic protein. Here,
we report that ARC contributes to chemotherapy resistance by
abolishing mitochondrial fission mediated by dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1). Our results show that both HeLa and
human gastric cancer (SGC-7901) cells have a high expression
level of ARC. Doxorubicin at a low dose can slightly induce
apoptosis in HeLa and SGC-7901 cells. In contrast, knockdown
of ARC by its RNA interference enables the same low dose of
doxorubicin to significantly induce apoptosis in HeLa and
SGC-7901 cells. These data indicate that ARC is responsible for
the cell resistance to doxorubicin treatment. Mitochondrial
fission has recently been shown to be involved in triggering
apoptosis. In exploring the molecular mechanism by which
ARC participates in antagonizing doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, we observed that doxorubicin is able to induce
mitochondrial fission that can be inhibited by ARC. Our
results further show that Drp1 accumulates in mitochondria
and mediates the signal of doxorubicin to induce mitochondrial fission. ARC is able to prevent Drp1 accumulations in
mitochondria. Finally, we identified that PUMA is required for
Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria. ARC inhibits Drp1
accumulations in mitochondria by directly binding to PUMA.
Taken together, our results reveal a chemotherapy-resistant
model in which ARC inhibits PUMA-mediated Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria and the consequent mitochondrial
fission. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):492–500]

Introduction
One obstacle of cancer therapy is the development of cancer
resistance to chemotherapy. The molecular mechanisms by which
the resistance is developed remain to be fully understood.
Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is
an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis. Previous studies reveal that
ARC is specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (1, 2).
However, a growing body of evidence shows that ARC is also
expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and primary
human cancers (3, 4). In particular, overexpression of ARC in

of mutation in its catalytic GTPase active site has been shown to
block mitochondrial fission and cytochrome c release during
apoptosis (24, 25). It has been reported that Bax/Bak promotes
sumoylation of Drp1 and its stable association with mitochondria
during apoptosis (26). PUMA is a member of Bcl-2 family, and
exclusively located to mitochondria. It can bind to Bcl-2 and BclX(L), thereby inducing cytochrome c release and the consequent
activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (27, 28). It remains unknown
as to whether PUMA can facilitate Drp1 accumulations in
mitochondria.
The present study was designed to elucidate whether doxorubicin induces apoptosis by triggering mitochondrial fission, and if
so, whether it is regulated by ARC. Our results show that the
susceptibility of doxorubicin to inducing mitochondrial fission and
apoptosis in cancer cells is dependent on the expression levels of
ARC. ARC is able to inhibit mitochondrial fission induced by
doxorubicin. Strikingly, ARC prevents Drp1 accumulations in
mitochondria through directly associating with PUMA, the latter
facilitates Drp1 to accumulate in mitochondria. Our data suggest
that ARC contributes to cell resistance to chemotherapy by
targeting the mitochondrial fission machinery.

manufacturer’s instructions. The specificity of the oligonucleotides was
confirmed by comparison with all other sequences in Genbank using
Nucleotide BLAST. There was no homology to other known human DNA
sequences.
Adenovirus construction and infection. Adenovirus harboring the
cDNA of ARCT149A (AdARCT149A) was constructed using the Adeno-X
Expression System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Adenovirus ARC (AdARC) and adenovirus h-galactosidase (Adh-gal) were
as we described (31). Viruses were amplified in 293 cells. Cells were infected
with the virus at the indicated multiplicity of infection (moi). After washing

with PBS, culture medium was added and cells were cultured until the
indicated time.
Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as we
described (29). In brief, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4jC in a lysis buffer.
To perform immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were precleared with
10% (vol/vol) protein A-agarose (Roche) for 1 h on a rocking platform.
Specific antibodies were added and rocked for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates
were captured with 10% (vol/vol) protein A-agarose for another hour. The
agarose beads were spun down and washed thrice with NET buffer. The
antigens were released and denatured by adding SDS sample buffer.
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as we reported
earlier (29). In brief, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4jC in a lysis buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 3 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L DTT,
250 mmol/L sucrose, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1%
Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail]. Samples were subjected to
12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal-protein
loading was controlled by Ponceau red staining of membranes. Blots were
probed using primary antibodies. Blots were then probed by horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruse). Antigen-antibody
complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Cell Signal
Biosciences).
Preparations of subcellular fractions. Subcellular fractions were
prepared as we described (23). In brief, cells were washed twice with PBS
and the pellet was suspended in 0.2 mL of buffer A [20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L PMSF, 250 mmol/L sucrose] containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail. The cells were homogenized by 12 strokes in a
Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 750 g for
5 min at 4jC to collect nuclei and debris. The supernatants were
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4jC to collect mitochondria-enriched
heavy membrane pellet (HM). The resulting supernatants were centrifuged
to yield cytosolic fractions.

by doxorubicin. Enforced expression of ARC could attenuate
mitochondrial fission upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1C).
To understand whether the effect between ARC and doxorubicininduced mitochondrial fission exists in other types of cancer cells,
SGC-7901 cells were used. We observed a similar result in SGC-7901
cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, it seems that ARC is able to inhibit
doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial fission.
Drp1 is required for doxorubicin to induce mitochondrial
fission. Drp1 is involved in mitochondrial fission (14, 26). We asked
whether Drp1 is necessary for doxorubicin to induce mitochondrial
fission. To this end, we prepared the siRNA construct of Drp1. Drp1
levels could be reduced by its siRNA but not its scramble form
(Fig. 2A). Mitochondrial fission could be induced by doxorubicin
in the absence but not presence of Drp1 siRNA (Fig. 2B). Concomitantly, doxorubicin-induced cell death could be attenuated
by Drp1 siRNA (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the role of Drp1 in
doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial fission, we produced another
Drp1 siRNA construct. This construct could reduce mitochondrial
fission and cell death induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 2D). These
results suggest that Drp1 is a prerequisite for doxorubicin to induce
mitochondrial fission and cell death.
ARC prevents Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria. Drp1
participates in regulating mitochondrial fission by translocating
from the cytoplasm to mitochondria (14, 32). We detected the
subcellular locations of Drp1 upon doxorubicin treatment. The
levels of Drp1 in HM were increased upon doxorubicin treatment in
HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence was used to further
detect the localizations of Drp1 before and after doxorubicin
treatment. In the control untreated cells, Drp1 was distributed
throughout the cytoplasm and showed a distinct pattern from the
mitoTracker. Upon doxorubicin treatment, Drp1 accumulated
around the perinuclear region, and its pattern coincided very

Results
Doxorubicin induces mitochondrial fission inhibited by
ARC. It has been previously found that ARC is highly expressed in
the cardiac and skeletal muscle (1, 2). Recent studies have shown
that ARC also is expressed in some types of cancer cells (5, 6).
However, the role of ARC in the chemotherapeutic resistance
remains largely unknown. Mitochondrial fission is related to the
initiation of apoptosis. We tested whether ARC is related to
mitochondrial fission in doxorubicin-induced cell death. ARC could
be detectable in cancer cells including HeLa and SGC-7901 but not
in the normal HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1A ). Administration of
doxorubicin at a high dose (2 Amol/L) could induce mitochondrial
fission in HeLa cells as revealed by the morphologic alterations
(Fig. 1B). We counted the cells undergoing mitochondrial fission
upon doxorubicin treatment. A time-dependent increase in
mitochondrial fission could be observed (Fig. 1B, right). We
analyzed the expression levels of ARC in response to doxorubicin
treatment. Doxorubicin led to a decrease in ARC expression levels
in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, right). These data suggest that ARC can be a
target of doxorubicin in its apoptotic program. The reduction in
ARC expression levels upon treatment with doxorubicin led us to
consider whether ARC can influence mitochondrial fission induced

abolishment of Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria induced by
doxorubicin (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that PUMA is necessary
for Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria.
To understand whether the regulation of PUMA on Drp1
accumulations plays a functional role in mitochondrial fission,
we detected whether PUMA knockdown can influence mitochondrial fission. Doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial fission could be
attenuated by PUMA knockdown (Fig. 4C). Concomitantly,
knockdown of PUMA resulted in a reduction in cell death upon
doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4D). A second siRNA construct of
PUMA exerted a similar effect on mitochondrial fission induced by
doxorubicin (Fig. 4E). Thus, it seems that PUMA is required for
Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria and the consequent fission of
mitochondria.
ARC prevents Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria by
directly binding to PUMA. The regulation of PUMA on Drp1
accumulations in mitochondria led us to consider whether it can
be interrupted by ARC. ARC could inhibit Drp1 accumulations in
mitochondria in response to PUMA stimulation (Fig. 5A). PUMA
has been shown to be exclusively located in mitochondria (27, 28).
Our previous work has shown that the phosphorylated ARC
at threonine-149 is located in mitochondria, whereas the
nonphosphorylatable ARC with threonine-149 mutated to an

closely with that of the mitoTracker (Fig. 3B). These results suggest
the accumulations of Drp1 in mitochondria in response to
doxorubicin treatment.
Because ARC is able to prevent mitochondrial fission as shown
in Fig. 1, we asked whether ARC can influence Drp1 distributions.
Enforced expression of ARC could attenuate Drp1 accumulations in
mitochondria in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). ARC also could inhibit Drp1
accumulations in mitochondria in SGC-7901 cells upon treatment
with doxorubicin (data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that
ARC can prevent Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria.
PUMA is required for Drp1 to accumulate in mitochondria.
In the following experiments, we explored the molecular
mechanism by which ARC inhibits Drp1 accumulations in
mitochondria. PUMA has been shown to be a prerequisite for
doxorubicin to initiate apoptosis (27, 28, 33). Our previous work
has shown that ARC is able to target PUMA, thereby preventing
PUMA-mediated apoptosis (31). This encouraged us to test
whether PUMA is related to Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria
in the apoptotic pathway of doxorubicin. To this end, we
produced the siRNA construct of PUMA. Doxorubicin treatment
led to an elevated level of PUMA. PUMA siRNA but not its
scramble form could attenuate PUMA elevation induced by
doxorubicin (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of PUMA resulted in the

association between ARC and PUMA could be observed in response
to doxorubicin treatment. A strong association between ARC and
PUMA could be observed in cells expressing exogenous ARC.
Enforced expression of ARCT149A led to no significant alterations
in ARC and PUMA association levels (Fig. 5D). Taken together,
these data indicate that there is a cross-talk between ARC and
PUMA in regulating mitochondrial fission.
Knockdown of endogenous ARC sensitizes doxorubicin to
inducing Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria. We carried out
experiments to test whether endogenous ARC participates in
the regulation of mitochondrial fission. First, we used RNAi
technology to knockdown ARC. Doxorubicin at a low dose was
able to slightly induce Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria. In
contrast, doxorubicin at the same low dose induced a significant
elevation of Drp1 levels in mitochondria upon ARC knockdown.
The scramble form of ARC-siRNA had no obvious effects on
doxorubicin-induced Drp1 accumulations (Fig. 6A). These data
suggest that endogenous ARC participates in controlling Drp1
accumulations in mitochondria.

alanine residue (ARCT149A) is localized in the cytoplasm.
Furthermore, the phosphorylated ARC but not ARCT149A is able
to inhibit apoptosis (23). To confirm the role of ARC in controlling
Drp1 accumulations induced by PUMA, we tested whether
ARCT149A is able to influence Drp1 accumulations. The accumulations of Drp1 in mitochondria could not be significantly
influenced by ARCT149A (Fig. 5A, lane 5, middle and bottom),
although it had a comparable expression level as ARC (Fig. 5A, lane
5, top). These data suggest that ARC can control PUMA-induced
Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria.
Subsequently, we detected whether ARC can influence mitochondrial fission and cell death in response to PUMA stimulation.
PUMA was able to induce mitochondrial fission that was inhibited
by ARC but not ARCT149A (Fig. 5B). Also, cell death induced by
PUMA could be attenuated by ARC but not ARCT149A (Fig. 5C).
These data indicate that ARC plays a functional role in controlling
PUMA-induced mitochondrial fission and cell death.
We tested whether ARC inhibits PUMA-mediated Drp1 accumulations through directly interacting with PUMA or not. A weak

Subsequently, we detected mitochondrial fission and cell death.
As shown in Fig. 6B, 0.2 Amol/L doxorubicin alone induced a

death. Strikingly, an elevated amount of cells underwent mitochondrial fission and death in response to the same dose of
doxorubicin treatment upon ARC knockdown. A second siRNA
construct of ARC could exert a similar effect on Drp1 localization
(Fig. 6C), mitochondrial fission, and cell death (Fig. 6D). These data
suggest that the abrogation of endogenous ARC can reduce the
resistance of cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment.

been shown that the anticancer action of doxorubicin is elicited
through DNA damage and/or reactive oxygen species generation by
redox reaction (7, 34). Doxorubicin also can activate caspases (8).
Our present study shows that doxorubicin is able to activate the
mitochondrial fission machinery. It would be interesting to
elucidate the relationship between mitochondrial fission and other
events such as reactive oxygen species generation in the apoptotic
cascades of doxorubicin.
The molecular mechanism by which Drp1 is recruited from the
cytosol to the mitochondrial surface is not fully understood. It has
been shown that Drp1 accumulation in mitochondria is likely
mediated by membrane-associated receptors (35, 36). hFis1 is an
outer membrane protein that is proposed to mediate Drp1
accumulation in mitochondria in mammalian cells (37). On the
contrary, a recent study shows that the accumulation of Drp1 in
mitochondria results from its irreversibly locking on the membrane
in an hFis1-independent but Bax/Bak-dependent manner (26).
However, there is also opposite evidence showing that the fission of
mitochondria is a dispensable event in Bax/Bak-dependent
apoptosis (38). PUMA is a member of Bcl-2 family, and can be
up-regulated by p53. It can bind to Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) thereby
inducing cytochrome c release and the consequent activation of
caspase-9 and caspase-3 (27, 28). We have previously showed that
PUMA can be activated by daunomycin in a p53-dependent
manner (31). Our present work reveals that PUMA is a prerequisite
for doxorubicin to induce mitochondrial fission. In contrast to Bax
that is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm (39, 40), PUMA
is exclusively located to mitochondria (27, 28). If the recruitment of

Discussion
Chemotherapy plays an important role for the treatment of a
variety of cancers. However, there is a distinct problem that the
cancer cells are resistant to a variety of therapeutic drugs such as
doxorubicin. In exploring the mechanism by which the cancer cells
are resistant to doxorubicin, our present study reveals that
doxorubicin triggers apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial fission.
However, this effect of doxorubicin can be inhibited by the
antiapoptotic protein ARC in the cancer cells. Our results further
revealed that doxorubicin activates PUMA, the latter facilitates
Drp1 accumulations in mitochondria. Strikingly, ARC inhibits
mitochondrial fission by directly targeting PUMA. Our data may
provide a new clue in understanding the molecular mechanism of
chemotherapy resistance.
Doxorubicin is the most widely used chemotherapeutic agent in
the treatment of human tumors. However, the mechanism of
apoptosis induced by doxorubicin has not been fully clarified. It has

ARC Inhibits Mitochondrial Fission

that p53 can negatively regulate ARC expression (31). p53 is known
to play an important role in mediating DNA damage–induced
apoptosis (44). The chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin
require p53 to initiate apoptosis (33). It would be interesting to
understand the role of p53 in mitochondrial fission.
The induction of apoptosis is beneficial for the treatment of those
diseases that are related to abnormal cell proliferation such as
cancers. In contrast, the heart is an organ composed of terminally
differentiated postmitotic cardiac myocytes. Induction of apoptosis
in cardiomyocytes may lead to pathophysiologic disorders. In fact,
doxorubicin has been shown to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis,
thereby leading to heart failure (45, 46). ARC is the first antiapoptotic protein thus far identified to be highly expressed in the
heart. Our present study reveals that doxorubicin needs to be in a
high dose to induce apoptosis in cancer cells expressing ARC. The
cardiotoxicity induce by doxorubicin at a high dose limits its usefulness in chemotherapy. In light of the key role of ARC in controlling doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, it is necessary to find out
the molecular approaches that can down-regulate ARC expression
in cancer cells but up-regulate ARC in cardiomyocytes. Our present
work warrants further studies to explore ARC as a potential target
for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Drp1 in mitochondria is due to its irreversibly locking on the
membrane (26), it can be speculated that PUMA may directly
or indirectly facilitate the locking of Drp1 in mitochondrial
membrane.
Our present study reveals that ARC can inhibit doxorubicininduced mitochondrial fission. We and others have previously
shown that ARC plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity
in multiple ways. These include the prevention of cytochrome
c release from mitochondria into cytosol (18, 23), and the
maintenance of mitochondrial permeability transition (18).
The consequent events of mitochondrial fission include the
collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome
c release (24, 25, 38). It is possible that ARC elicits its effects against
the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome
c release through inhibiting mitochondrial fission. This hypothesis
needs to be tested in future studies.
The subcellular localization of ARC in cancer cells is cell type
dependent. For example, ARC is predominantly distributed in the
nuclei of HCT116 and A549 cells (4, 6). However, in melanoma cell
lines ARC is predominantly distributed in the mitochondria (3).
Our present study reveals that ARC is localized in the mitochondria
in HeLa and SGC-7901 cells. PUMA is exclusively localized in the
mitochondria (27, 28). Our results show that ARC can directly bind
to PUMA. This further suggests the functional site of ARC is in
mitochondria. Bax has been show to be involved in Drp1
accumulations in mitochondria (26), whereas ARC is able to bind
to Bax thereby inhibiting Bax-mediated apoptosis (16, 17). Bax in
the healthy cells is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. In
response to apoptotic stimulation, it translocates to mitochondria
where it triggers cytochrome c release (41–43). It remains to be
determined as to whether the association between ARC and Bax
occurs in the cytoplasm and/or mitochondria.
It is of note that the expression levels of ARC are decreased in
response to doxorubicin treatment. Our recent work has shown
