Novel role of Engrailed 1 as a prosurvival transcription factor in
basal-like breast cancer and engineering of interference peptides
block its oncogenic function
AS Beltran1, LM Graves1 and P Blancafort1,2
Basal-like breast tumors are aggressive cancers associated with high proliferation and metastasis. Chemotherapy is currently the only
treatment option; however, resistance often occurs resulting in recurrence and patient death. Some extremely aggressive cancers are
also associated with hypoxia, inﬂammation and high leukocyte inﬁltration. Herein, we discovered that the neural-speciﬁc transcription
factor, Engrailed 1 (EN1), is exclusively overexpressed in these tumors. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of EN1
triggered potent and selective cell death. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of EN1 in normal cells activated survival pathways and
conferred resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Exogenous expression of EN1 cDNA reprogrammed the breast epithelial cells toward
a long-lived, neural-like phenotype displaying dopaminergic markers. Gene expression microarrays demonstrated that the EN1 cDNA
altered transcription of a high number of inﬂammatory molecules, notably chemokines and chemokine receptors, which could mediate
prosurvival pathways. To block EN1 function, we engineered synthetic interference peptides (iPeps) comprising the EN1-speciﬁc
sequences that mediate essential protein-protein interactions necessary for EN1 function and an N-terminal cell-penetrating peptide/
nuclear localization sequence. These EN1-iPeps rapidly mediated a strong apoptotic response in tumor cells overexpressing EN1, with
no toxicity to normal or non EN1-expressing cells. Delivery of EN1-iPeps into basal-like cancer cells signiﬁcantly decreased the ﬁfty
percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of chemotherapeutic drugs routinely used to treat breast cancer. Lastly, matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-time of ﬂight mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that EN1-iPeps captured targets
involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, the EN1-iPeps bound the glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase
(EPRS) target, which has been associated with the transcript-speciﬁc translational control of inﬂammatory proteins and activation of
amino-acid stress pathways. This work unveils EN1 as an activator of intrinsic inﬂammatory pathways associated with prosurvival in
basal-like breast cancer. We further build upon these results and describe the engineering of iPeps targeting EN1 (EN1-iPeps) as a novel
and selective therapeutic strategy to combat these lethal forms of breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Basal-like breast cancers lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(HER2). The presence of stem cell-like signatures, frequent
mutations of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and breast cancer
1, early onset (BRCA1) and genomic instability are major hallmarks
of these tumors.1–3 The response of these cancer types to ﬁrst-line
chemotherapy is often hindered by acquired resistance to
treatment, recurrence and metastatic disease.1,4,5 It has been
recognized that survival and resistance of cancer stem cell-like
cells to therapy is associated with a deregulated immunoresponse
and/or excessive inﬂammation in the tumor microenvironment.
High expression of inﬂammation (e.g. aberrant secretion of
inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines by breast cancer cells
or stromal cells) and angiogenesis-related gene signatures are
associated with poor prognosis.2,6–11 Importantly, there is a lack of
selective therapeutic agents to target these tumors and patients
are left only with chemotherapy options.12,13

Recent large-scale studies of breast carcinomas have elucidated
the fundamental role of transcription factors (TFs) as driving
forces of oncogenesis in basal-like breast cancers.13–18 Notably,
many developmental homeodomain (HD) containing TFs (TFHDs)
are aberrantly expressed in cancer and are drivers of cancer
initiation, disease recurrence and resistance to treatment.18–20
However, despite their critical role in cancer, TFs have not been
successfully targeted with conventional small molecules and have
been considered ‘undruggable’.
In this paper, we discovered the highly selective overexpression
of neural-speciﬁc TFs, notably Engrailed 1 (EN1) in basal-like breast
cancers. In humans, two paralogs, EN1 and EN2, control pattern
formation during development of the central nervous system.21
EN1 is expressed in neural progenitor cells and may expand and
maintain the pool of dopaminergic neurons with prosurvival
activity. A proposed function of EN1 in dopaminergic neurons is to
promote survival and resistance to apoptotic insults, which
preserves the longevity of these cells throughout adult life.22

Targeting EN1 in basal-like breast cancer
AS Beltran et al

4768
Mutations in the Engrailed genes cause neural cell degeneration
induced by caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, which is one of the
pathological features of Parkinson’s disease.21 Interestingly, in a
recent study, the EN2 paralog has been associated with nonresectable prostate cancers.23 The functional signiﬁcance of the
overexpression of Engrailed members in cancer, and more
particularly, in basal breast cancer, is not known.
Our results outline the critical role of the neural-speciﬁc TFHD
EN1 in controlling inﬂammatory signals, survival and resistance
to cell death in highly aggressive basal-like breast cancers
having stem/progenitor cell characteristics. We also show that
novel synthetic peptides or interference peptides (iPeps)
comprising the highly conserved EN1-hexamotif sequence
involved in protein–protein interactions, induce potent and
selective apoptosis in highly resistant basal-like breast cancer
cells. These peptides could be used as a novel selective
therapeutic strategy to combat these forms of tumors for which
no successful targeted treatment is available.
RESULTS
EN1 is overexpressed in the basal-like intrinsic subtype of breast
cancer
To identify oncogenic TFHDs in basal-like breast cancers, we ﬁrst
examined the mRNA expression of more than 200TFHDs using the
UNC337 gene expression tumor database.24 A total of 114 TFHDs
were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed (Po0.05) across tumor
subtypes, with high representation of neural speciﬁc TFHDs. The
TFHDs EN1 and EN2 were differentially expressed across the intrinsic
subtypes (Figure 1a). However, EN1 had the highest and most
selective enrichment in the basal-like breast cancers with B4-fold
increased expression (P ¼ 4.65e  50) over normal-like, HER2, luminal
A and B subtypes (Figure 1a and Supplementary Table S1).
To address whether EN1 expression in cancer patients
correlated with poor survival, we took advantage of the MERGE
550 tumor database.25 Cancer patients with higher EN1 expression
had the lowest relapse-free survival (P ¼ 0.00399), indicating an
association of high EN1 expression with poor clinical outcome
(Figure 1b). Conversely, EN2 expression did not exhibit a
signiﬁcant impact on overall survival (data not shown).
To validate the gene expression microarray data, we quantiﬁed
EN1 mRNA levels in a panel of breast cancer cell lines
encompassing all of the six different intrinsic subtypes of breast
cancer. In accordance with the microarray data, the EN1 gene was
highly expressed in basal-like cell lines with highest expression in
SUM149PT, and absent in luminal lines, such as MCF-7 and normal
breast epithelial cells (human mammary epithelial cells (HUMEC);
Figure 1c). The EN1 protein expression levels in the cell lines were
in accordance with mRNA levels, as assessed by immunoﬂuorescence. EN1 protein expression was detected in a sub-population of
cells, which displayed mostly strong nuclear staining (Figure 1d).
The EN1 expression in triple-negative tumor specimens with
basal-like features (e.g. high-grade ductal invasive carcinomas)
revealed some cytoplasmic and mostly nuclear localization. Similar
to the detection pattern in the cell lines, the EN1 staining in the
tissue sections was heterogeneous. In contrast, none of the
hormone receptor-positive tumors or normal-like tissue examined
(e.g. breast tissue from a mammoplastic reduction) revealed any
detectable EN1 staining (Figure 1e). Basal-like tumors are
associated with germ-line mutations in the breast cancer 1, early
onset (BRCA1) and p53 genes.3,14,16,26 We next took advantage of
cell lines derived from genetically engineered mouse models to
interrogate the expression of EN1 in these samples. Interestingly,
high EN1 mRNA expression was detected in two cell lines
possessing stem cell-like characteristics: the T11 line, isolated
from p53-deﬁcient mice,27,28 and the BRCA1-A1.8 line, isolated
from a BRCA1 mutant mice29–31 (Supplementary Figure S1). In
summary, these results suggest that EN1 was overexpressed in a
Oncogene (2014) 4767 – 4777

sub-population of triple-negative breast cancer cells with basallike features.
EN1 expression confers survival features to breast cells
To decipher the role of EN1 in breast cancer cells, we used
lentivirally delivered short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knockdown
EN1 expression in the basal cancer cell line SUM149PT cells. Fortyeight hours after transduction, the EN1-speciﬁc shRNAs (but not
control shRNA) triggered a strong cell death (Figure 2a) that was
due to induction of apoptosis, as assessed by caspase-3 (Figure 2c)
and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-cleavage assays (Figure 2d). In
contrast, transfection of EN1-shRNAs in the low-EN1-expressing
MDA-MB-231 cell line did not reveal any signiﬁcant changes in
caspase-3 activity relative to control (Supplementary Figure S2).
The above results indicated that shRNA-mediated knockdown of
EN1 selectively impacted survival pathways in cell lines expressing
high levels of EN1.
In the neural system, it has been proposed that EN1 protects
neurons from mitochondrial complex I insults.22 Likewise, we
investigated whether EN1 could have a similar role in the basallike breast cancer cell lines. EN1 cDNA was overexpressed in
SUM149PT cells using a lentiviral vector, and the transduced cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of rotenone, a
mitochondrial complex I toxin, and taxol, a microtubuledestabilizing agent. Transfection of EN1 cDNA increased EN1
protein expression (Supplementary Figure S3a) and signiﬁcantly
increased the ﬁfty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for
rotenone (from 1.078 to 19.61 mM; Figure 2e) and taxol (from 7.24
to 47.81 mM; Figure 2f) relative to control transduced cells. In fact,
EN1 overexpression in breast cancer cells did not result in
enhanced cell proliferation (Supplementary Figures S3b and c)
or tumorigenic potential, as shown by soft agar colony formation
assays (Supplementary Figures S3d and e). Similarly, the overexpression of the EN1 cDNA in other cell lines, including cell lines
not expressing the EN1 gene, such as MDA-MB-231, also resulted
in an increased resistance to neurotoxins and other chemotherapeutic insults (data not shown).
Lastly, we examined potential downstream transcriptional
targets of EN1 by performing genome-wide gene expression
microarray analysis of SUM149PT cells overexpressing the EN1
cDNA and control vector (Supplementary Table S2). We speciﬁcally
chose SUM149PT cells as they represent one of the few cell lines
isolated from inﬂammatory breast cancer.32,33 Gene ontology
analysis of differentially regulated genes revealed the
upregulation of pathways involved in inﬂammation, cytokine
and chemokine activity and angiogenesis (e.g. CXCL11, CD69,
IL23A, interleukin 1 receptor-like 1/2, CXCL6, interleukin 8 and
vascular epithelial growth factor A; Supplementary Table S3).
These results suggest a potential link between EN1 expression and
inﬂammatory breast cancer via the activation of downstream
chemokine signaling pathways.
To better understand the function of EN1 in the pathology of
breast cancer, the EN1 cDNA was overexpressed using a lentiviral
vector in primary preparations of HUMECs generated from
reduction mammoplasties. HUMEC cells were transduced with
either EN1 cDNA or a control enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein
(EGFP), and 72 h after transduction, these cells were seeded in
ﬁbroblast feeder cultures with human embryonic stem cell
medium, conditions that favor the propagation of mammary
stem/progenitor cells.20 Although the primary HUMEC control cells
could not be maintained in culture or passaged after 3 weeks, the
EN1-overexpressing cells survived for more than 6 months in
culture with a very low division rate (Figure 2g). Furthermore, the
HUMEC-EN1 cells differentiated into neural-like cells within a
period of 3 weeks when placed in a neural differentiation medium.
As EN1 is normally expressed in mesencephalic dopaminergic
neurons, the expression of mesencephalic dopaminergic-speciﬁc

A1 was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence. The HUMEC-EN1 cells
displayed strong EN1 nuclear and faint cytoplasmic staining, the

Interestingly, these cells also displayed strong dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter expression
(Figure 2g, lower right panel) as well as tyrosine hydroxylase
and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (Figure 2g,
lower left panel). Despite the increase in dopaminergic markers,
the HUMEC-EN1 cells failed to display typical neuronal excitability
as assessed by whole-cell electrophysiological recording (data non
shown), suggesting that more than a single TF is necessary for full

conversion to functional dopaminergic neurons. Alternatively,
transduction of EN1 could give rise to dopaminergic neurons at a
very low frequency. Overall, these results suggest that expression
of EN1 in breast cells could activate developmental pathways
similar to those of dopaminergic neurons, providing cells a means
to sustain survival against apoptotic stimuli.
Targeting EN1 with iPeps
To inhibit the function of EN1 as a TF in basal-like breast cells, we
engineered synthetic iPeps comprising the EN1-speciﬁc hexamotif
and ﬂanking protein sequences from the N terminus of the HD.
Synthetic peptides comprising either the murine EN2 or HOXA9
hexamotifs have been previously shown to compete in vitro with

mediating penetration of peptide cargos containing hydrophobic
residues, such as W and Y.35
The EN1-iPeps and iPep controls were ﬁrst tested in SUM149PT
cells carrying high EN1 expression. Cells were treated with a fulllength 29-mer peptide (iPep624) comprising the N terminal, less
conserved amino-acid sequences, the hexamotif, and the C-terminal tail. As a control, we generated the iPep624DHEX in which the
hexamotif was mutated from the wild-type (wt) WPAWVY to the
GAAGAG sequence. These mutations were expected to dramatically abolish the activity of the peptide. Both peptides were
included in the culture medium of the basal cancer cells in
increasing (0–100 mM) concentrations and incubated for 8 h at
37 1C. Treated cells were ﬁrst analyzed using the Cell Titer Glo
(CTG) assay, which monitors metabolic viability. Although cells
treated with the iPep624DHEX did not show signiﬁcant changes in
cell viability, even at 100 mM, the cells treated with iPep624 showed
strongly reduced viability in a dose-dependent manner with an
IC50 of 17.5 mM (Figure 3d). This IC50 value is in the range of

the EN2-PBX1 or HOXA9-PBX1 complexes and disrupt TFHD–TFHD
interactions necessary for cooperative DNA binding.34 As shown in
Figure 3a, the interaction between PBX1 and HOXA9 is mediated
by a hexamotif-like sequence. A similar hexamotif sequence
(WPAWVY) is present in human EN1 protein, and located at the N
terminus of the HD. We reasoned that the delivery of a synthetic
peptide comprising the human EN1 hexamotif and ﬂanking
sequences would phenocopy the effect of the EN1-speciﬁc
shRNAs and induce selective cell death in the basal-like breast
cancer cells.
Sequence comparison showed that the hexamotif WPAWVY
and the CTRYSDRPS C-terminal sequence of the human EN1
protein were highly conserved among vertebrate and invertebrate
species (Figure 3b). A speciﬁc cell-penetrating peptide (sequence
KKKRKV) that acts as nuclear localization sequence was included in
the N terminus of the iPep sequence variants (Figure 3c). We
chose this speciﬁc nuclear localization sequence/cell-penetrating
peptide sequence as it has been shown to be effective in

concentrations observed with other peptides delivered with cellpenetrating peptides.35 Both caspase-3 activity (Figure 3e) and the
number of apoptotic nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation
(Figure 3f) were signiﬁcantly higher in the iPep624-treated cells
as compared with non-treated or iPep624DHEX-treated cells.
Furthermore, the cell viability defect provoked by iPep624 was
rescued by ectopic transfection of the EN1 cDNA (Figure 3g),
suggesting that with higher EN1 expression, more peptide is
needed to inhibit its function. These experiments indicate that the
apoptotic response induced by EN1-iPep624 was speciﬁc and
dependent on the expression of EN1.
To rule out the possibility that differences in apoptosis were the
consequence of differential internalization and/or intracellular
distribution of the peptides, real-time peptide internalization
studies were performed. Both active and mutant iPeps were
coupled to a C-terminal ﬂuorescein molecule and delivered into
SUM149PT cells. Cells were imaged every 2 min over a 60-min
period using a confocal microscope. The total ﬂuorescence per
image was measured as the total number of pixels captured at
488 nm. We found that both active and inactive iPeps entered in
the cytoplasm in o2 min and reached a plateau with saturating
levels of ﬂuorescence attained after B40 min (Figures 4a and b;
Supplementary Figure. S4).
EN1-iPeps selectively target basal-like breast cancer lines
expressing EN1
To test the speciﬁcity of the EN1-iPep in cell lines expressing EN1,
we delivered the iPeps into a panel of breast cancer cell lines
expressing different amounts of EN1. The iPep624 selectively
decreased cell viability of basal-like EN1-expressing cell lines such
as SUM149PT, SUM159PT, SUM102 and SUM229 but had no effect
on cell viability in low or non-expressing EN1 cell lines, such as the
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HUMEC cell lines (Figure 5a). In addition,
the mutant iPep624DHEX peptide did not signiﬁcantly affect cell
viability of any of the breast cancer cell lines at the maximum
tested concentrations (100 mM) (Figure 5b).
To investigate the requirement of the two W residues in the
activity of the peptide, mutant iPeps were generated with either the
ﬁrst (iPep624W1DA) or the second tryptophan (iPep624W2DA)
mutated to alanine and delivered into SUM149PT cells. These
mutations were expected to disrupt the structure of the hydrophobic pocket necessary for EN1 to cooperatively bind other
binding partners in the cell. Both W mutants retained activity but
signiﬁcantly increased the IC50 as compared with the wt iPep624.
Molecular modeling analysis of the alanine mutations suggests a
iPep697

wide hydrophobic pocket in the iPep624W2DA and a narrow
interacting interface in iPep624W1DA (Figure 5c, right). These results
highlight the structural selectivity of the peptide and the requirement of the W residues in the EN1 hexamotif for inhibitory activity.
Next, we mapped the minimal EN1-iPep sequence retaining cell
growth inhibitory activity in vitro. We generated peptide EN1iPep682 (Figure 3c) lacking the less evolutionarily conserved ﬁve
N-terminal residues, and two C-terminal residues of the parent
peptide iPep624. The iPep682 was even more effective than the
parent full-length iPep624 peptide decreasing the IC50 from 17.5
to 12.5 mM (Figure 5d). Interestingly, a 13-mer peptide lacking all
the N-terminal residues upstream of the hexamotif (iPep697) was
less active than the wt EN1-p624 peptide (Figure 5d), suggesting
that the N-terminal arm of the peptide immediately adjacent to
the hexamotif (comprising the proline–valine–leucine residues)
also provides sequence-speciﬁc determinants essential for inhibitory activity.
Lastly, we investigated the capability of the active EN1-iPep
(iPep682) to sensitize breast cancer cells to Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs, such as taxol and 5-ﬂuorouracil.
SUM149PT cells were particularly resistant to these agents with an
IC50 of 7.6 mM for taxol (Figure 5e) and 610 mM for 5-ﬂuorouracil
(Figure 5f) after 48 h of treatment with these agents. However,
cells treated for 48 h with drug and for 8 h with low concentration
of the iPep682 (500 nM) signiﬁcantly decreased the IC50 of taxol
from 7.6 mM to 49 nM (Figure 5e), and 5-ﬂuorouracil from 610 to
29.47 mM (Figure 5f). These experiments demonstrate that the low
doses of iPeps could further sensitize highly resistant breast
cancer cells to chemotherapy agents.
EN1-iPeps capture intracellular targets involved in control of
translation and transcriptional regulation
To investigate the binding partners of the iPeps in cancer cells, we
carried out afﬁnity capture immunoprecipitation experiments
using the biotinylated active iPep624 as bait, and the iPep624D
HEX as negative control. We used total protein extracts from
SUM149PT cells to capture endogenous proteins able to bind
these peptides in vitro. Elutes were loaded on a one-dimensionalsodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel to
visualize the enrichment of individual proteins. As shown in
Figure 6a, a protein of B170 kDa was differentially enriched in the
iPep624-elutes relative to iPep624DHEX. Protein identiﬁcation
using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of ﬂight/
time of ﬂight mass spectrometry revealed a highly signiﬁcant
score for the glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), an enzyme

captures and binds EPRS from total extracts of SUM149-PT cells. Left: SDS–PAGE gel outlining the bands differentially bound to iPep624 and

the amino-acid stress factor DDIT3 is stimulated upon EPRS
inhibition.36 To investigate if these targets were modulated
by the EN1 cDNA and the EN1-iPeps, both control and
EN1-overexpressing SUM149PT cells were challenged with active
iPep624 or inactive iPep624DHEX and processed by real-time PCR.
As expected, the targets COLA1, COLA2 and S1004A were
signiﬁcantly downregulated in the EN1-overexpressing cells, and
this downregulation was signiﬁcantly inhibited by the addition of
active peptide. Conversely, the DDIT3 target was signiﬁcantly
upregulated in EN1-overexpressing cells by the active iPep over
control, in accordance with the speciﬁc pharmacological inhibition
of EPRS by halofuginone.36 Interestingly, treatment of SUM149PT
cells with halofuginone, iPep624 (Figure 6d) or an EPRS-speciﬁc
shRNA (data not shown) induced potent breast cancer cell death.
Cotreatment of SUM149PT cells with iPep624, but not peptide
control, sensitized the basal-like breast cancer cells to halofuginone
(Figures 6d-e). Consistent with EN1 providing resistance to cell
death, the combination of iPep624 and halofuginone was more
effective in SUM149PT-control cells than the SUM149PT-EN1expressing cells (0.041 versus 0.49 nM). Overall, these studies
indicated that EPRS was bound by iPep624 and full-length EN1 in
the cancer cells. Moreover, these results suggested that pharmacological inhibition of EPRS using iPeps or the combination of iPeps
with speciﬁc inhibitors of EPRS, (halofuginone), was extremely
effective for inhibition of basal-like breast cancer cell survival.
Lastly, we examined whether iPep624 could also interact with
other TFHDs expressed in basal-like cancers, using immunoprecipitation and western blotting. We observed speciﬁc interactions
of iPep624, but not control peptide, with the PBX family members,
notably PBX1 and PAX6 (Supplementary Figure S5). PBX1 and PAX6
are well-known partners of Engrailed proteins in other cell systems,
particularly in dopaminergic neurons.37 We also discovered a
speciﬁc interaction between EN1-iPep and the TFHD Distaless 6
(DLX6), which was found expressed at very high levels in the basal
cancers in our tumor gene expression database (Supplementary
Table S1). DLX6 expression has been associated with organ-speciﬁc
breast cancer metastases.38 In summary, our data demonstrate that
the EN1-iPeps are able to inhibit the oncogenic function of EN1 in
basal cancer cells expressing EN1, by interacting with multiple
intracellular partners involved in transcriptional regulation
(particularly in the neural system) and further suggest that EPRS
could be a novel downstream effector of EN1.
DISCUSSION
In our effort to discover biomarkers suitable for speciﬁc targeting
of basal-like breast cancer, we explored a new approach by
searching the breast cancer DNA microarray database for TFs
speciﬁcally upregulated in the basal breast cancer subtype. Our
analyses demonstrated that EN1 was selectively and highly
expressed in basal-like breast cancers with an average of fourfold
over all the other subtypes. These results are in agreement with a
recent study in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma where
high EN1 was correlated with histologic tumor grade, tumor
location and patient outcome.39
Interestingly, one of the functions of EN1 is to modulate
mitochondrial signals in adult dopaminergic neurons that protect
cell survival pathways. We sought to determine if EN1 has a similar
role in models of basal-like breast cancer, which frequently respond
to treatment but later acquire drug resistance. Knocking down EN1
expression in basal-like breast cancer cells with a speciﬁc shRNA
resulted in a strong apoptotic response as demonstrated by caspase3 activation assays. These results are similar to those observed in
mouse mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, where an shRNA
targeting the Engrailed genes activated caspase-3 and induced
apoptosis in o24 h.40 Interestingly, EN1-overexpressing cells treated
with rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, or taxol, a
microtubule inhibitor, were more resistant to these chemotherapy
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

regimens than control-transduced cells. Thus, these results suggest
that EN1 conferred protective features to breast cancer cells, similar
to that observed in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons.22
On the basis of these and other studies, we propose that basallike tumor phenotype is the result of the development of unique
survival pathways, some of which are expressed in long-lived neuralstem cells, and EN1 maintains those traits. The discovery of EN1 as a
potential biomarker for basal-like breast cancer represents an
opportunity to target selectively the tumor cells that are at the
origin of dormancy, and resistance to anti-cancer treatments. In the
future, the expression of EN1 needs to be determined in a larger
number of triple-negative breast cancer samples, with known clinical
variables, particularly BRCA1 status, comprising the tissue before and
after acquired resistance or relapse (e.g. drug resistant metastatic
tissues), to ascertain whether EN1 is a marker involved in acquired
resistance beyond the initial sensitivity to therapy in cancer patients.
Our gene expression microarray analysis of EN1-overexpressing
cells show differential regulation of multiple cytokines and
other immunomodulators normally engaged in inﬂammatory
responses, T-cell immunity, ﬁbrosis and angiogenesis (e.g.
interleukin 8, interleukin 1 receptor-like 1, CD69, ﬁbronectin 1
and vascular epithelial growth factor A). Cytokines and
chemokines have emerged as one of the main mechanisms by
which inﬂammation promotes breast cancer development,
therapy-resistance and metastasis.6,7 Recent gene expression
data suggest that the immune response proﬁle and
inﬂammatory signature of breast cancers provide prognosis
information and may predict response to treatment.8,11 This
inﬂammation gene expression signature demonstrates aberrant
overexpression of cytokines, chemokines, vascular epithelial
growth factor A, ﬁbronectin 1 and other immunomodulators,
notably T-cell tumor immunity.8,11 Similarly, cytokines and
cytokine receptors are also expressed by dopaminergic neurons
and have been associated with prosurvival, oxidative stress and
resistance to cell death.41–43 The high EN1-expressing cell line
SUM149PT was isolated from inﬂammatory breast cancer,32
suggesting a novel, potential link between EN1 expression,
inﬂammation and basal-like cancer.
To inhibit the function of EN1 as a TF in basal breast cells, we
generated iPeps, which encompassed the sequence known to
mediate protein–protein interactions between TFHDs.44–46 We
designed iPep624 using the structural information from the HOXPBX interactions.46 We have shown that the active iPeps
comprising the wt EN1 hexamotif selectively targeted cells
expressing EN1, potentially by interfering or competing with EN1
partners in the cancer cell. In a similar study by Morgan and
co-workers,47–50 short peptides derived from the HOX-family of
TFs were able to abolish cancer cell growth in leukemia and other
cancer models.23,47–50 These studies also demonstrated that
peptides derived from HOX proteins were able to bind PBX in
the cancer cells by competing with the endogenous HOX TFs.
Interestingly, our studies demonstrate that EN1-iPeps were able to
bind several important TFs that act as oncogenes in the mammary
gland, such as PBX, Paired and Distaless family members. Our
proteomics analysis also suggests that the EN1-iPeps bind a novel
target, EPRS, which has been involved in the control of translation
of inﬂammatory proteins and amino-acid stress responses, and that
pharmacological inhibition of EPRS represents a potentially new
treatment for basal-like breast cancer. In myeloid cells, EPRS has
been shown to be a critical component of the interferon-gactivated inhibition of translation (GAIT) complex, which controls
transcript-speciﬁc translation of inﬂammatory gene expression.51–53
Future research will be necessary to investigate the exact
mechanism of action of the iPeps by mapping the sites of
interaction and the effect on the activity on EPRS and downstream
effectors in the cancer cells.
In summary, our work demonstrates that EN1 is overexpressed
exclusively in basal-like breast cancers, where it has a role in
Oncogene (2014) 4767 – 4777

promoting survival and resistance to chemotherapy. As basal-like
breast cancers are enriched in cancer stem/progenitor cell
signatures,24,54 we propose that EN1 might represent a potential
novel biomarker for these cancer stem/progenitor cells.
Furthermore, iPeps can be further developed and used to treat
recalcitrant cancers and to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy
and other treatments. Our work suggest that iPeps represent
customable agents that could be similarly tailored to inhibit other
TFs overexpressed in other cancer types in the near future, such as
EN2, and even other TF families that require highly conserved and
cooperative protein–protein partnerships for biological activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lentivirus preparation and transduction of breast cell lines
Plasmids expressing the EN1 cDNA (vector EX T1021-Lv107, Genecopoeia,
Rockville, MD, USA) or EN1 shRNAs (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)
were transfected with Gagpol-, VSVG- and RSV-REV-coding plasmids in HEK
293T cells using Lipofectamine and Plus Reagent cationic lipids (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transduction of breast cells was performed as
described.20

EN1 expression and prediction of relapse-free survival
To estimate the expression of EN1 across the intrinsic molecular subtypes
of breast cancer, we calculated the mean expression of EN1 in the entire
median centered UNC337 patient database using the subtype calls
described in Prat et al.24 Relapse-free survival was calculated using
MERGE-550 database.55

probed with antibodies speciﬁc for PAX6, DLX6, PBX1, PBX2 and PBX3
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Detection was performed with
ECL Detection System (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and quantitated
using Image J version 1.46 (ImageJ; NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Mass spectrometry/identiﬁcation of EPRS
Proteins were eluted from the streptavidin beads coated with biotinylated
iPep624 or iPep624DHEX, resuspended with SDS–PAGE sample buffer and
applied to SDS–PAGE (10% acrylamide; Figure 6a). Gels were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue and select bands unique to the EN1 immunoprecipitates were excised, digested with trypsin and the peptides were
extracted and analyzed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of ﬂight/time of ﬂight mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA,
USA; 4800 Plus). Mass spectrometry spectra were obtained in reﬂector
positive ion mode and peaks with signal-to-noise ratio above 10 were
selected for MS/MS analysis (maximum of 45 tandem mass spectrometry
spectra per spot). All spectra were searched using GPS Explorer, Version 3.6
(AB Sciex) linked to the Mascot (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA, USA)
search engine and a Human IPI database was used.

Gene expression microarrays
The stable cell lines SUM149PT-EGFP and SUM149PT-EN1 (N ¼ 3) were used
for gene expression analyses. RNA was puriﬁed, ampliﬁed, labeled and
hybridized57 using Agilent 4  44K oligo microarrays (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA; platform GPL10481). The probes/genes were ﬁltered
by requiring the lowest normalized intensity values in all samples to be
410. The normalized log 2 ratios (Cy5 sample/Cy3 control) of probes
mapping to the same gene were averaged to generate independent
expression estimates. All microarray data have been deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus under accession number GEO: GSE47358.

Quantitative real-time PCR
The quantitative RT–PCR reaction was performed with TaqMan Fast
Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as
described.56
