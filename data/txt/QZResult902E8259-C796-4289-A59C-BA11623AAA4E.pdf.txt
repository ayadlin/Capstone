BACKGROUND. The primary objective of this prospective phase 2 study of CPT-11
in adult patients with recurrent temozolomide-refractory anaplastic astrocytoma
(AA) was to evaluate 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).

METHODS. Forty patients (27 men and 13 women) ages 17 to 58 years (median
age, 38 years) with radiographically recurrent AA were treated. All patients had
of

been treated previously with surgery, involved-field radiotherapy, and adjuvant
chemotherapy. Fifteen patients were treated at first recurrence with an alternative

CPT-11 administered intravenously once every 3 weeks, which was defined operationally as a single cycle. Neurologic and neuroradiographic evaluations were
performed every 9 weeks.

RESULTS. All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 39 patients were evaluable
for response. In total, 302 cycles of CPT-11 (median, 6 cycles; range, 1–22 cycles)
were administered. CPT-11-related toxicity included diarrhea (19 cycles), leukopenia (16 cycles), fatigue (11 cycles), anemia (6 cycles), delayed nausea/vomiting (5
cycles), neutropenia (5 cycles), and renal failure (1 patient, 1 toxic death). Two
patients (5%) patients required erythrocyte transfusions. Nine patients (23%)
demonstrated a radiographic complete response (1 patient) or partial response (8
patients), 16 patients (41%) demonstrated stable disease, and 14 patients (36%)
had progressive disease after 3 cycles of CPT-11. The median time to tumor progression was 4.1 month. The median survival was 6.9 months, and the 6-month
and 12-month PFS rates were 40% and 5%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. CPT-11 demonstrated modest efficacy with acceptable toxicity in
this cohort of adult patients with recurrent AA, all of whom had failed on prior
temozolomide chemotherapy. Cancer 2008;112:2038–45.  2008 American Cancer

he treatment of recurrent, high-grade glioma (HGG) is problematic, because established therapeutic modalities are only modestly effective. These therapies include chemotherapy, radioactive
implants, stereotactic radiotherapies, immunotherapy, and reoperation.1–29 Chemotherapy for recurrent, malignant, primary brain
tumors has limited benefit, primarily because response to chemotherapy is of limited duration. In an analysis of 8 institutional Phase
II studies of chemotherapy for recurrent HGG, Wong et al. reported
that response rates in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma
(AA) were 14%, and the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at
6 months was 31%.13 The most active drugs in use are the nitrosoureas
(eg, carmustine and lomustine [CCNU]), temozolomide (TMZ), pro-

carbazine, cis-retinoic acid, and platinum compounds.1–28 Another chemotherapy with purported activity in recurrent HGG is CPT-11 (irinotecan).29–35
The primary objective of this 4-institution, prospective, phase 2 trial was to observe whether CPT-11
given every 3 weeks (dosing: 600 mg/m2 per day for
patients on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs
[EIAED] or 350 mg/m2 per day for patients on nonenzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs [NEIAED])
could significantly delay progression in patients with
neuroradiographically recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma
(AA). Forty adult patients with recurrent supratentorial
AA previously treated with surgery, radiotherapy and
TMZ were entered into study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was performed at the University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center
and Hospital, the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Center, the University of Massachusetts, and the
University of South Florida H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center and Research Institute. The study was activated in January 2000 and closed in January 2007.
Approval of the protocol and informed consent by
the university Human Investigation Committee was
obtained. Informed consent was obtained from each
patient.

Objectives and Endpoints
The 2 primary objectives of this study included
determination of efficacy and toxicity of CPT-11 in
the treatment of patients with TMZ-refractory, recurrent or progressive AA. The primary response endpoint was PFS at 6 months (6-month PFS).
Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS),
time to disease progression, and response. Toxicity
was evaluated in all eligible patients who received at
least 1 cycle of CPT-11.
Eligibility Criteria
Patients were required to have histologically proven,
neuroradiologically confirmed, recurrent AA. Patients
must have progressed after definitive radiotherapy
and TMZ chemotherapy. Patients may have had no
more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. At least
4 weeks must have elapsed since the last dose of
chemotherapy, and patients must have recovered
from the adverse effects (AEs) of prior therapy.
Patients could not have received prior CPT-11 therapy. Patients were required to have radiographically
measurable intracranial disease in which recurrent
tumor was measurable bidimensionally (1 cm 3
1 cm) on cranial contrast-enhanced magnetic reso-

nance imaging (MRI) studies. Histologic confirmation of tumor recurrence was not required for entry
into the study. Pregnant or lactating women were not
permitted to participate. Patients of childbearing
potential were required to implement adequate contraceptive measures during participation in this
study. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky
performance status 60 and a life expectancy
>3 months.
Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic functions were required and were defined as follows:
absolute granulocyte count > 1500/dL or white
blood cell count > 4000/dL, platelet count > 100,000/
dL, total bilirubin level < 1.8 mg/dL, transaminase
levels < 4 times the upper limit of normal, and creatinine concentration < 1.8 mg/dL (or creatinine clearance 60 mL/m2/1.73).
All patients were aware of the neoplastic nature
of their disease and willingly consented to participate
after they were informed regarding the procedures to
be used, the experimental nature of the therapy,
alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks, and
discomforts. Patients with carcinomatous meningitis
were not eligible. No serious, concurrent medical illnesses or active infection could be present that
would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive
CPT-11 therapy. Patients could not have an active,
concomitant malignancy except skin cancer (squamous cell or basal cell). Eligible patients ranged in
age from 18 years to 80 years.

Drug Schedule
CPT-11 (irinotecan; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Princeton, NJ) was administered at a dose of 350 mg/m2 to
patients on NEIAED or 600 mg/m2 to patients on
EIAED. CPT-11 was administered intravenously over
120 minutes on a single day.31 Concurrent dexamethasone was permitted for control of neurologic signs
and symptoms. Premedication included antiemetics
(ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron), dexamethasone (20 mg), and atropine (0.5 mg), all administered intravenously. Prechemotherapy hydration of
0.50 liter of normal saline was given intravenously
over 1 hour. No posthydration intravenous fluids
were administered.
Postchemotherapy medication included prochlorperazine for nausea or vomiting and loperamide
for diarrhea. A cycle of therapy was defined operationally as 21 days during which CPT-11 was administered on Day 1. Treatment with CPT-11 was
repeated every 21 days provided that all hematologic
toxicity from the previous cycle had resolved to grade
2 or less and that all nonhematologic toxicity had
recovered to grade 1 or less. If recovery had not

occurred by Day 21, then the subsequent cycle of
CPT-11 could be delayed by no more than 2 weeks
until these criteria were met. All toxicities because of
CPT-11 therapy were rated according to the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria
(CTC) (version 3.0).
No dose escalations were permitted. The CPT-11
dose was reduced by 25% in patients with Grade 3
toxicity. Only 2 dose reductions were allowed.
Patients who had grade 3 toxicity of any type after 2
dose reductions were removed from study.
Oral dexamethasone was used concurrently in
26 patients and was increased in 8 patients who had
clinical disease progression. The dexamethasone
dose was decreased in 6 patients as their clinical status permitted.

Method of Evaluation
Recurrent AA was defined by objective neuroradiographic progression (>25% increase in tumor size)
compared with prior baseline neuroradiographic
images using the criteria reported by Macdonald
et al.36 All neuroradiographic studies were reviewed
locally by 2 neuroradiologists who were blinded to
treatment and by the principal investigator (M.C.C.).
All patients underwent cranial MRI that demonstrated progressive disease within 2 weeks of CPT-11
administration.
Blood counts were obtained weekly, neurologic
examinations were performed every 3 weeks, and
contrast-enhanced cranial MRI studies were obtained
every 9 weeks after every 3 cycles of CPT-11. Neuroradiographic response criteria, as defined by Macdonald et al., were used.36 A complete response (CR)
was defined as the disappearance of all enhancing or
nonenhancing tumor on consecutive computed tomography (CT) or MRI scans at least 1 month apart
with the patient off corticosteroids and neurologically stable or improved. A partial response (PR) was
defined as a reduction >50% in tumor size on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least 1 month apart,
with the corticosteroid dose stable or decreased and
with the patient neurologically stable or improved.
Progressive disease (PD) was defined as an
increase >25% in tumor size or any new tumor on
CT or MRI scans, or if the patient worsened neurologically with a stable or increased corticosteroid dose.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as all other situations. A response of SD, similar to CR and PR,
required a confirmation MRI scan 1 month after documenting the best response.
In patients with SD, PR, or CR, 3 additional
cycles of CPT-11 were administered; then, patients
were assessed again as described above. Patients

were continued on CPT-11 therapy until documentation of PD, when patients were removed from the
study and were either monitored or offered alternative therapy.
PFS and OS were defined as the time from the
first day of treatment with CPT-11 until progression
or death (PFS) or death (OS). Patients were removed
from the study if there was PD, development of
unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, or noncompliance with protocol requirements.

Experimental Design and Statistical Methods
The primary objective was to determine whether
CPT-11 significantly delays progression in patients
with recurrent AA. Historic values were obtained
from analysis of a database of 350 patients with
recurrent, HGG (including 125 patients with AA) who
were treated on consecutive, prospective, phase 2
trials in which the 6-month PFS rate was 31% for
patients with AA.13 The hypotheses tested were H0
(p  p0) versus H1 (p  p1), where p is the probability of remaining alive and progression free at
6-months with a Type I error a  .05 and a Type II
error b  .20. For patients with AA, p0 was set at
0.25, and p1 was set at 0.45, and we sought an
improvement in the 6-month PFS probability of 14%.
The current study was designed to accrue 40 patients
with AA. Success was defined as observing that >18
of 40 patients remained alive and progression free at
6 months (yielding a 5 .03 and b 5 .21). The associations of OS and PFS with patient’s baseline characteristics were evaluated by using the log-rank
test.38–43 The Pike estimate of relative risk (RR) based
on the log-rank test38 was used to provide a quantitative summary of the data, including 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).39,40 Initially, univariate
survival analyses were used to evaluate the association of all prognostic factors with OS and the time to
progression. The log-rank test was used to test the
association of survival or time to progression with all
baseline characteristics, adjuvant therapies, and salvage therapies. The median survival, the time to progression, and the associated 95% CIs were computed.
Kaplan-Meier plots41 were constructed to display the
estimated probabilities of OS and time to progression.

RESULTS
Study Population
Forty patients (27 men and 13 women) who ranged
in age from 17 years to 58 years (median age, 38
years) and who had recurrent AA (original pathology
was reviewed and confirmed in all patients by the
participating institution) were treated with CPT-11

(Table 1). Patients presented at the time of tumor recurrence with the following signs and symptoms:
increased intracranial pressure, as manifested by
increasing headache (n 5 28 patients; 70%), worsening seizures (n 5 14 patients; 35%), altered mental
status (n 5 6 patients; 15%), progressive hemiparesis
(n 5 6 patients; 15%), new-onset homonymous
hemianopsia (n 5 2 patients; 5%), and gait ataxia
(n 5 2 patients; 5%). Patient performance status
using the Karnofsky scale ranged from 70 to 100 (median, 80) at the time of documented tumor recurrence and initiation of CPT-11 therapy. Eight patients
were on EIAED, 24 patients were being treated with
an NEIAED, and 8 patients were on no antiepileptic
drug. Tumor locations, including multilobar tumors,
were as follows: frontal lobe, n 5 25 tumors (62.5%);
temporal lobe, n 5 10 tumors (25%); parietal lobe,
n 5 8 tumors (20%), thalamus, n 5 2 tumors (5%),
and occipital lobe, n 5 1 tumor (2.5%). Twenty-nine
patients had lobar tumors, and 11 patients had multilobar tumors. Pathology (reviewed by a panel of 2
neuropathologists at each participating institution)
indicate that all tumors were AA according to World
Health Organization criteria.
All patients had undergone surgery at diagnosis,
and a complete resection was accomplished in 12
patients (resection of all visible, contrast-enhancing
tumor confirmed in the immediate postoperative period), a partial resection was accomplished in 14
patients, and 14 patients underwent biopsy only (Table 1). Twenty patients (50%) underwent a second

surgery (biopsy in 2 patients, subtotal resection in 18
patients), and 2 patients underwent a third surgery
before study entry.
All patients had previously been treated with adjuvant limited-field radiotherapy (Table 1); and, in all
patients, conventional fractionated radiotherapy was
used in which 1.8 to 2 grays (Gy) were administered
daily (median tumor dose, 60 Gy; range, 54–60 Gy).
One patient received stereotactic radiotherapy at
the time of recurrence before the administration of
CPT-11.
All patients were treated with either TMZ29 or
carmustine10 chemotherapy after they received radiotherapy (Table 1). TMZ was administered on the
standard 5-day schedule. Patients received a median
of 10 TMZ cycles of therapy (range, 2–12 cycles). The
10 patients who were treated initially with carmustine received TMZ at first recurrence. Four patients
received other chemotherapy (carboplatin in 2
patients, sorafenib and CCNU in 1 patient each) after
adjuvant TMZ at the time of first recurrence and
before initiating CPT-11. All other patients began
CPT-11 immediately after they had documentation of
an initial recurrence (except for the 14 patients mentioned above), as demonstrated by neuroradiographic
progression (all patients) or clinical disease progression (60% of patients). The median time to initiation
of CPT-11 after initial surgery was 35 months (range,
4.4–167 months). In total, 302 cycles of CPT-11 were
administered. A minimum of 3 cycles of CPT-11 was
administered to each patient with 1 exception (a
patient who died after a single course of CPT-11) for
a median of 6 cycles (range, 1–22 cycles). CPT-11
was administered at the prescribed dose to all
patients. No other antiglioma agents aside from
dexamethasone were used during the study.

Toxicity
Toxicity was recorded using the NCI CTC (version
3.0). Table 2 lists all grade 2 through 5 toxicities that
were observed: Each number in the table represents
the sum of the highest grade of toxicity attained, per
toxicity, per cycle for all patients. In total, 302 treatment cycles were administered, during which there
were 17 grade 3 AEs (6% of all cycles) in 8 patients
(20% of all patients), no grade 4 AEs, and 1 grade 5
AE (diarrhea with dehydration and acute renal failure) in a single patient (2.5% of all patients). Grade 3
or greater AEs that were recorded included diarrhea
(4 patients; 10%), delayed vomiting (4 patients; 10%),
delayed nausea (2 patients; 5%), fatigue (2 patients;
5%), granulocytopenia (2 patients; 5%), leukopenia (1
patient; 2.5%), thrombophlebitis (1 patient; 2.5%),
neutropenic fever (1 patient; 2.5%), and anemia (1

patient; 2.5%). Two patients required transfusion
with packed erythrocytes. One patient developed febrile neutropenia with negative body fluid cultures.
One treatment-related death occurred related to
acute renal failure from dehydration.

Response
All patients were assessable for survival, and 39
patients were assessable for response. After 3 cycles
of CPT-11, the first MRI evaluations indicated that 14
patients (35.9.5%) had PD. Fifteen patients (37.5%)
received 3 cycles of therapy, and 23 patients (57.5%)
received >3 cycles of therapy. Patients who failed to
respond to CPT-11 were offered alternative or supportive therapy.
The median time to tumor progression was 4.1
months (95% CI, 2.1–6.2 months). No statistically significant association was observed between OS and
patients’ baseline characteristics, anticonvulsant type
(EIAED or NEIAED), or primary or salvage treatments. The risk of disease progression was greater in
men compared with women, but the 95% CI was
very wide (RR, 1.57; P 5 .045; 95%CI, 0.77–3.19).
Because only 16 patients (40%) achieved a PFS of at
least 6 months, rather than the 18 patients (45%)
prespecified in the study design, this trial failed to
meet its primary endpoint. The median survival was
6.9 months (95% CI, 5.1–10.8 months). The probability of survival at 12 months (standard deviation)
was 23%  8%, and the probabilities of 6-month and
12-month PFS were 40%  8% and 5%  3%, respectively. One patient (3%) demonstrated a CR; 8
patients (21%) demonstrated a neuroradiographic PR

Salvage Chemotherapy With CPT-11/Chamberlain et al.

(95% CI, 11%–39%); and 16 patients (41%) demonstrated SD (95% CI, 25%–57%).
There was no association observed between
response to CPT-11 and response to the prior regimen of TMZ, however, very few responses to TMZ
were observed. No difference was observed in the
pretreatment tumor volume in patients with either a
PR to CPT-11 or SD as compared with patients who
had PD.

DISCUSSION
In a seminal study on AA, Prados et al. concluded
that patients can be expected to have a median
survival >3 years; that young age and high Karnofsky
performance status have a positive influence on survival; and that salvage therapies may extend survival
after the onset of tumor progression for nearly a
year.21 In a separate European analysis of anaplastic
gliomas (predominantly AA), the median OS was
29 months (with a 5-year probability of survival of
38%.22 In another analysis by Prados et al., the
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group database was
reviewed and compared patients with newly diagnosed AA who were treated according to protocol
with either carmustine or combined procarbazine,
CCNU, and vincristine (PCV) adjuvant chemotherapy
after surgery and conventional external beam radiotherapy.2 From that retrospective analysis, there did
not appear to be any survival benefit to PCV adjuvant
chemotherapy. The study also posited that the inclusion of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients
with newly diagnosed AA, although it is a common
practice, could not be endorsed pending a randomized study. The Medical Research Council Brain
Tumor Working Group reported on the largest randomized trial comparing patients who received radiotherapy alone (RT) with patients who received RT
and PCV chemotherapy.1 Of 594 eligible patients,
19% (113 patients) had AA histology. There was no
difference in median survival (13-month median survival for the RT-only group); however, a trend was
reported for improved 2-year survival in the RT and
PCV group (2-year survival rate, 37% for RT only vs
42% for RT and PCV). In a recent meta-analysis by
the Glioma Meta-Analysis Trialists Group of 12 randomized trials, adjuvant chemotherapy improved
2-year survival by 6% in patients with AA (31% vs
37%).11 The above-mentioned studies suggest a modest benefit for the inclusion of chemotherapy in the
adjuvant treatment of AA, although the optimum adjuvant chemotherapy agent remains unsettled. Since
the introduction of TMZ into clinical practice in
2000, the established efficacy of TMZ in the treat-

2043

ment of recurrent AA and its modest toxicity have
resulted in TMZ supplanting nitrosoureas and other
regimens for the treatment of newly diagnosed AA.16
The majority of patients in the current study received
TMZ after radiotherapy—an increasingly common
neuro-oncology practice that is supported in part by
a recent European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer trial of adjuvant TMZ for glioblastoma multiforme demonstrating a survival benefit compared with historic controls (15 months vs
12 months).23
The best way to manage recurrent AA remains ill
defined notwithstanding a variety of studies. The majority of studies (including the current study) are
Phase II, nonrandomized trials comparing patient
outcomes with historic controls. In a randomized
trial of TMZ versus procarbazine for recurrent AA,
Yung et al. demonstrated an advantage to TMZ with
a 6-month PFS of 46%, an objective neuroradiographic response rate of 35%, and an OS of 13.6
months.16 In the study by Yung et al., 60% of patients
had received adjuvant carmustine, 18% underwent
reoperation at the time of recurrence, and the median time to tumor recurrence was 15.2 months.
These values are similar to the current findings,
except that 100% of our patients received adjuvant
chemotherapy, and 50% underwent reoperation at
time of tumor recurrence. Brem et al. reported on
another randomized trial of patients with recurrent
glioma (HGG) and compared surgery with or without
placement of biodegradable carmustine polymers
(Gliadel).24 Twenty-eight of 88 patients (32%) who
were enrolled in that study had AA. The results
demonstrated a 35% improvement in OS survival (31
weeks vs 23 weeks) and a 50% increase in 6-month
PFS (64% vs 44%). Although 32% of patients entered
onto that study had AA, a separate analysis of the
group was not reported. These robust results suggest
that reoperation is of benefit in patients with AA;
and, when a near complete resection can be performed, Gliadel may be an effective therapy. Unfortunately, only a fraction of patients (50% in the current
study) with recurrent AA are candidates for reoperation. Therefore, the majority of patients with active
disease are offered chemotherapy at progression.
Accordingly, Jaeckle et al. recently reported on the
combination of TMZ and cis-retinoic acid (Accutane)
for patients with recurrent HGG, of whom 22% were
chemotherapy naive.25 A 46% 6-month PFS and a
47-week median OS were reported among patients
with AA. These are compelling results, although
the dataset of patients with AA was small (n 5 28).

radiopharmaceutical toxins and molecularly targeted
therapies (such as small-molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases) currently are under active
study.26,27
The current study was directed at the population
of patients with AA who had failed prior TMZ chemotherapy and for whom further treatment appeared
to be warranted. The study did not require histologic
proof of recurrent AA, and it is possible that a portion of the group had radiation necrosis as opposed
to recurrent tumor. This appears to be unlikely for
the following reasons: The median time to treatment
with CPT-11 was 35 months, a time when issues of
pseudoprogression are unlikely.44 Only a single
patient received stereotactic radiotherapy, and the
risk of radiation necrosis is <5% in patients who
receive standard fractionated radiotherapy. Furthermore, 15 patients (37.5%) underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography studies, and
10 patients (25%) underwent MRI spectroscopy in
which recurrent, viable tumor was confirmed radiographically, although the limitations of both types of
imaging studies in differentiating necrosis from tumor are well recognized. Finally, 20 patients (50%)
who had histopathologically confirmed AA underwent reoperation. The study did not require reexamination of specimens from second surgeries; thus, a
proportion of patients who we assumed had AA may
have progressed to glioblastoma. Therefore, the study
may have evaluated both patients with AA and
patients with secondary glioblastoma.
CPT-11 appears to be attractive, because prior
single-agent studies have suggested that it has activity against HGG and particularly against AA.29–35
Nonetheless, CPT-11 has been studied primarily in
patients with glioblastoma multiforme, and there is a
relative dearth of data regarding response in patients
with AA. By way of example, Batchelor et al. reported
on 5 patients with AA without histology-specific outcome data, Friedman et al. reported on 10 patients with
AA (1 patient who achieved a PR and 6 patients with
SD), and Prados et al. reported on 13 patients with
AA (22% 6-month PFS).29,33,35 Furthermore, CPT-11
toxicity is manageable (approximately 25% grade 3–5
toxicity in the current study) and noncumulative, permitting administration without growth factor support.
Topoisomerase inhibitors such as CPT-11 do have
pharmacodynamically important interactions with
EIAED (which are used almost universally in patients
with recurrent AA). The induction of cytochrome P450
enzymes by NEIAED such as carbamazepine and phenytoin dramatically reduces the area under the concentration time curve of CPT-11.45 Fortunately, the
necessary dosage adjustments for CPT-11 in patients

who are receiving such anticonvulsant agents have
been defined well by prior studies.36
In conclusion, CPT-11 used at the dose and on
the schedule described in this study of patients with
previously treated, TMZ-refractory, recurrent AA
appears to have modest benefit (6-month PFS, 40%),
although the primary response endpoint of our study
(a 45% 6-month PFS rate) was not achieved. Outside
the setting of a clinical trial, CPT-11 is a reasonable
choice for patients with recurrent AA who have previously failed TMZ. Recent data reporting on the use
of combination therapy for patients with recurrent,
HGG, with CPT-11 given in conjunction with targeted
therapies such as bevacizumab or the oral panvascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor
AZD2171, appear promising.46,47 Such regimens may
enhance the antiglioma activity of CPT-11 and
should be investigated.
