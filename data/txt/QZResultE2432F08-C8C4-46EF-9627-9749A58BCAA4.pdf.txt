ABSTRACT
Objective: Gene therapy is a frontier in modern medicine. In the present study,
we explored a new technique for the effective treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR)
breast cancer by combining fully the advantages of multidisciplinary fields, including
image-guided minimally invasive interventional oncology, radiofrequency technology,
and direct intratumoral gene therapy.
Results: Combination treatment with PHSP-TK plus RFH resulted in significantly
higher TK gene transfection/expression, as well as a lower cell proliferation rate
and a higher cell apoptosis index, than those of control groups. In vivo validation
experiments with MRI confirmed that combination therapy resulted in a significant
reduction of relative tumor volume compared with those of control animals, which
was supported by the results of histologic and apoptosis analyses.
Materials and methods: The heat shock protein promoter (PHSP) was used to
precisely control the overexpression of thymidine kinase (TK) (PHSP-TK). Serial in vitro
experiments were performed to confirm whether radiofrequency hyperthermia (RFH)
could enhance PHSP-TK transfection and expression in a MDR breast cancer cell line
(MCF7/Adr). Serial in vivo experiments were then carried out to validate the feasibility
of the new technique, termed interventional RFH-enhanced direct intratumoral PHSP-TK
gene therapy. The therapeutic effect of combination therapy was evaluated by MRI
and confirmed by subsequent laboratory correlation.
Conclusions: This study has established “proof-of-principle” of a new technique,
interventional RFH-enhanced local gene therapy for MDR breast cancer, which
may open new avenues for the effective management of MDR breast cancers via
the simultaneous integration of interventional oncology, RF technology, and direct
intratumoral gene therapy.

INTRODUCTION

recurrence after surgical removal of breast cancer.
However, currently-available chemo-drugs are effective
only in certain subgroups of patients with breast cancer
because they target specific proteins within tumors (e.g.,
trastuzumab targets breast cancers with HER2 expression).
In addition, multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer leads
to recurrence at distant metastatic sites in a proportion of

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
in women worldwide, accounting for 29% of new
cancer cases among women in 2015, with an estimated
annual mortality rate of 15% in the United States [1].

breast cancer patients after adjuvant chemotherapeutic
treatment. Drug resistance to chemotherapy can be divided
into two types: intrinsic and acquired. Intrinsic resistance
comprises cancers that possess chemodrug resistance
related factors before the initiation of chemotherapy.
Acquired resistance denotes cancers that acquire
chemotherapy resistance during chemotherapy after
being initially chemodrug sensitive, This may be caused
by mutations or the activation of compensatory signaling
pathways [2].
Cancer cells can adapt and develop one or more
chemotherapeutic resistance pathways, which can result
in treatment failure. In addition, it is known that multidrug
resistance leads to failure of chemotherapy in over 90%
of metastatic breast cancer patients [3]. Once tumor cells
become resistant to a single class of anticancer agent,
resistance to other unrelated drugs is more likely to occur.
Despite advances in chemotherapy of breast cancer,
resistance to chemotherapy remains a major obstacle to
effective chemotherapy. Thus, it is necessary to explore
alternative therapeutic approaches for the effective
treatment of MDR breast cancer.
Gene therapy is a frontier in modern medicine.
To date, more than 1000 gene therapy clinical trials and
applications have been completed or are in progress
worldwide. Most of these clinical trials have focused
on oncology [4–6]. Among different gene therapies, the
Herpes Simplex Virus Thymidine Kinase (HSV-TK) gene
has been recognized as a promising tool for oncologic
gene therapy. The HSV-TK gene is a suicide gene that
converts non-toxic ganciclovir (GCV) monophosphate
to toxic ganciclovir triphosphate, thereby killing cancer
cells [7]. In addition, overexpression of TK genes can
result in a bystander effect, via which phosphorylated
GCV is transferred from TK-expressing cancer cells to
neighboring non-gene transferred cancer cells, resulting in
the death of the neighboring cancer cells [8]. The efficacy
of gene therapy is primarily dependent on the amount and
duration of gene expression. Therefore, regulating the
expression of HSV-TK in the target organ is critical for
the success of gene therapy.
Heat shock protein (HSP) is a highly conserved
polypeptide that plays a role in the response to a variety
of stresses, such as hyperthermia, aging, oxidative stress,
and metabolic challenge. HSP-70 is a subgroup of the
HSP family that is inducible and shows negligible basal
expression in various types of cells [9]. The expression of
HSPs increases sharply in the presence of heat shock [10],
and the HSP-70 promoter is therefore commonly used to
establish heat-controlled gene expression systems [11–13].
Previous studies from our group and others have shown
that adjuvant hyperthermia at approximately 41°C to 45°C
can enhance the effects of different therapeutics in various
cancers [14–16]. However, hyperthermia-enhanced
therapies are limited by various factors, including the
availability of devices for local heat delivery to the target,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

unsatisfactory penetration of transporting heat to the
target, thermal injury to healthy tissues adjacent to the
targets, and the toxicity and mutagenic potential of heating
vehicles. These weaknesses restrict the clinical application
of hyperthermia-enhanced cancer therapies [17, 18].
Recent rapid advances in cancer therapy include
image-guided, minimally invasive interventional
oncology techniques [19, 20]. Previous studies from
our group indicated that a combination treatment with
local heat-controlled chemotherapy and interventional
radiofrequency hyperthermia (RFH) enhances the therapy
of various types of malignancies [21–23]. These results
encouraged us to develop a new oncologic therapy
technique, employing interventional mild RFH for
enhanced heat-controlled suicide gene therapy, to solve the
problem of multidrug resistance in breast cancer patients.

RESULTS
In vitro experiments
The PHSP-TK plasmid was transfected into MCF7/
Adr cells, and detection of GFP fluorescence indicated the
successful expression of the PHSP-TK gene (Figure 1B).
PHSP-TK gene expression was induced by RFH at 37°C and
45°C (Figure 1C). Real-time PCR demonstrated that RFH
significantly enhanced PHSP-TK gene expression in MCF7/
Adr cells (Figure 1D).
When the RF generator was operated at 2–3 Watts
through the MRIHG, the temperature in chamber  1
increased from 37°C to approximately 45°C, which
generated a stable heat gradient along the four chambers
(Figure 2).
RFH enhanced the cell killing efficacy of the PHSP-TK
gene, resulting in a decrease in cell survival compared
with other cell groups (Figure 3A). This was confirmed by
performing cell proliferation assays, the results of which
showed that combination treatment with PHSP-TK plus RFH
significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, resulting in
a lower cell viability rate (3.8% ± 0.2%) than that of the
other treatment groups (100% ± 3.22% vs. 91.4% ± 3.7%
vs. 49.8% ± 2.0% vs. 92.6% ± 6.4% vs. 73.3% ± 5.5%,
Control, Mock, PHSP-TK, RFH, and RFH + Mock groups,
p < 0.0001) (Figure 3B). Cell apoptosis assays showed that
the combination treatment with PHSP-TK + RFH resulted
in a higher rate of apoptosis (65.99% ± 0.78%) than other
treatment groups (2.13% ± 0.27% vs. 1.99% ± 0.19% vs.
28.89% ± 1.72% vs. 3.25% ± 0.18% vs. 3.49% ± 0.21%,
Control, Mock, PHSP-TK, RFH, and RFH + Mock groups,

+ RFH) than in the control, RFH-only, or PHSP-TK-only
treatment groups (Figure 5B). Representative images of
excised tumors are shown in Figure 5C. The average RTV
was significantly smaller in the PHSP-TK + RFH group
(1.10 ± 0.29) than in the control, RFH, or PHSP-TK groups
on day 14 after gene therapy (3.72 ± 0.72, 6.04 ± 1.52,
and 7.27 ± 1.71, respectively; p < 0.05, p < 0.0001, and
p < 0.0001; Figure 5D).
Subsequent laboratory examinations further
confirmed that the number of apoptotic cells and average

apoptosis index of the PHSP-TK + RFH group (38.94% ±
3.21%) were significantly higher than those of the control,
RFH, or PHSP-TK groups (13.66% ± 0.64%, 20.30% ±
2.68%, and 28.17% ± 2.64%, respectively; p < 0.001,
p < 0.001, and p < 0.05; Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy is one of the three principal
treatments for breast cancer, namely surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The resistance of tumor

cells to anticancer agents results in treatment failure in
breast cancer. Overcoming this obstacle has become an
urgent issue for the effective management of patients
with breast cancer. Gene therapy is becoming a promising
option to the treatment of MDR breast cancer. Suicide
gene therapy has been applied to different cancers, with
some effectiveness [24–26]. However, some unresolved
issues, such as the limited dose of systemically delivered
genes and low level of gene expression at the targets
in vivo, have limited the clinical application of cancer
gene therapy. In this work, we attempted to solve these

problems. We first constructed the heat shock protein
promoter-mediated HSV-TK gene-carrying plasmid and
transfected it into breast cancer cells. After RFH, HSV-TK
gene expression was significantly increased (Figure 1C
and 1D). Our study have confirmed that the proliferation
of tumor cells was inhibited in vitro, and tumor volume
was reduced in vivo, compared with control, RFHonly, or PHSP-TK-only treatment groups (Figure 5D).
These results indicate that RFH can increase HSV-TK
gene expression and thereby enhance the killing effects
of suicide gene therapy on chemodrug resistant breast

cancers. The potential mechanisms of RFH-enhanced
gene expression include tissue fracture via heating, higher
permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, higher cellular
metabolism, and activation of the HSP pathway [27–29].
These mechanisms facilitate the entrance of therapeutics
into target tumor cells, thereby promoting the effective
destruction of tumor tissue.
Temperature fluctuation can influence the efficiency
of gene expression, so the heating temperature must be
precisely controlled. Some groups have employed placing
mice bearing tumor xenografts in preheated air [30] or a
water bath [31] to promote the therapeutic effects. These
conventional hyperthermia methods can result in nonuniform heating and irregular changes in temperature. To
overcome this barrier, we placed a sensitive fiber optic
temperature sensor into the tumor mass near the RFH
antenna, which ensured that RFH at the target site could
be precisely controlled.
Current technologies allow the delivery of
therapeutic genes using a systemic approach, which often
results in limited doses of therapeutic genes at the target.
In addition, the systemic delivery of genes creates a risk
of toxicity to healthy and vital organs, particularly when
the amount of intravenously-administered therapeutic gene
dose is increased to reach the target [32]. Image-guided
minimally invasive interventional techniques provide the
advantage of delivering highly concentrated genes locally
and directly to targets without causing damage to healthy
organs [33, 34]. Recently, some studies have confirmed
that local hyperthermia at 40–45°C via an interventional
approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness of
different therapeutics, including genes, in various cancers
[21, 35].
In the present study, we attempted to overcome
the disadvantages of current gene therapy techniques by
combining the advantages of (i) interventional techniques
for direct intratumoral delivery of highly concentrated
therapeutic genes to targets; and (ii) interventional RFmediated local hyperthermia to enhance gene expression
at the target sites. This combination treatment smoothed
the way for the treatment of chemodrug-resistant breast
cancers.
Although our results are encouraging, further
studies to optimize the therapeutic protocol and long-term
follow-up to evaluate the therapeutic effects of this novel
combination are warranted.

simultaneous integration of interventional oncology, RF
technology, and direct intratumoral gene therapy, instead
of systemic gene therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present study included two primary
components: in vitro experiments were performed in
MCF7/Adr to establish “proof-of-principle” for the RFHenhanced killing effect of genes on multidrug-resistant
human breast cancer cells; and in vivo experiments on
living animals were used to validate the feasibility of
the new technique, interventional RFH-enhanced direct
intratumoral gene therapy for chemotherapeutic-resistant
breast cancer.

In vitro experiments
Construction of the PHSP-TK plasmid
The gene expression plasmid (PHSP-TRE/TNFalpha/IRES/tTA) was kindly provided by Prof. Masamichi
Kamihira (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). The
promoter sequence of HSP and the TRE and IRES-tTA
elements were from the plasmid PHSP-TRE_TNFalpha_IRES_tTA, whereas the HSV-TK gene sequence
was from the plasmid pQMSCV/PTNIG. The DNA
fragments encoding the HSV-TK gene were inserted into
the PHSP-TRE_TNF-α_IRES_tTA plasmid, replacing the
TNF-α sequence. Then, the fragments were ligated into
the lentivirus vector TPV4107, which included a green
fluorescence protein (GFP) gene (Shengbo Company,
Shanghai, China). The overall cloning process of the final
therapeutic gene product, PHSP-TK, is shown in Figure 1A,
and the DNA sequences were subsequently confirmed
using a DNA sequencer. The lentiviral vector, TPV4107,
was used as the mock vector, which did not include the
PHSP-TK gene.

Preparation of lentivirus
Lentiviruses were produced and purified as
previously described [36]. Lentiviral vectors were cotransfected into 293T cells to produce lentiviral particles
with Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Thermo Fisher,
Waltham, MA, USA ). After 16 h, the 293T cells were
cultivated with fresh medium at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator
for 24 h. Collected and pooled supernatants were then
centrifuged at 70,000g for 2 h at 20°C. After discarding
the supernatants, the viral pellets were resuspended in
100 ul of 1× HBSS and stored at −80°C for future use.

CONCLUSIONS
The present study confirmed that interventional
RFH can promote HSP promoter-mediated TK suicide
gene transfection and expression in chemotherapeuticresistant breast cancers, thereby enhancing the efficacy
of TK/GCV gene therapy. This technical development
may open new avenues for the effective management of
chemotherapeutic-resistant breast malignancies via the

Gao (College of Pharmacy, Zhejiang University). This
human breast cancer cell line was used because the
MCF7/Adr cell line is resistant to multi-chemodrugs (such
as Doxorubicin, the first-line chemodrug for systemic
treatment of breast cancer). The cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
100 mg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
MA, USA). Cultured cells were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Mock plus RFH; (v) Mock transfection-only; and (vi) no
treatment as a control. For statistical analysis, each group
included six chambers. For gene transfection, PHSP-TK/
lentivirus (MOI = 20/chamber) was added to the cellcontaining chamber for 48 h, followed by heating at 45°C
for 20 min using an RF system. For the cell groups with
RF heating, a 0.032 inch magnetic resonance imagingheating-guidewire (MRIHG) was placed under the bottom
of chamber, and then connected to a 2450 MHz RF
generator (GMP150, OPTHOS, Rockville, MD, USA) to
heat the slides at 45°C for 20 min. The temperature of
the chambers was constantly recorded by a thermometer
(Photon Control, Burnaby, British Colombia, Canada)
(Supplementary Figure S1).
After the treated cells were incubated for 48 h,
the culture medium of these cells was replaced by fresh
culture medium containing GCV (10 μg/ml) for another
48 h.

Detection of PHSP-TK gene transfection and
expression
MCF7/Adr cells were split into four-chamber plates
(4 × 104/chamber). After 24 h, the cells were incubated
with PHSP-TK/lentivirus [multiplicity of infection (MOI)
= 20] for 12 h, followed by the addition of fresh culture
medium. Subsequently, qPCR was performed to determine
HSV-TK gene expression at 72 h post-transfection. qPCR
was performed using an ABI 7700 sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and
the amplifications were performed using SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan).

Cytotoxic and cell apoptosis assays
Cytotoxic and cell apoptosis assays were performed
to evaluate the cell killing effects of PHSP-TK/GCV
on breast cancer cells. Cell proliferation was assessed
using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, CCK8 solution (100 μl) was added into the cell chamber and
incubated for 2 h, and the absorbance of each chamber
was measured at 450 nm using a Universal Microplate
Reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Then, cell apoptosis assay was performed as described
in the Annexin V-APC apoptosis detection kit using flow
cytometry analysis (Becton Dickinson FACScan, Mount
View, VA, USA). Then, the apoptosis index was analyzed
by counting the number of Annexin V positive cells (red
staining) per HPF (high-power field, 40×) in 10 slides for
each group.

Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was
performed using 1 µg of total RNA. The thermal cycling
conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 35 cycles at
95°C for 30 sec, 59°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 45 sec.
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was used as an internal control to normalize the gene
expression level. The relative quantification of gene
expression was detected using the 2-ΔΔCt method [37]. The
primer sequences are shown in Table 1.

Statistical analysis

(PBS) as a control. Human chemotherapeutic-resistant
breast cancer cells (5 × 106) were subcutaneously and
unilaterally implanted into the back of mice to create
animal models with breast cancers. Once the tumor grew
to approximately 5 mm in diameter, 10–15 ul concentrated
viruses were injected into tumors each time with a total of
6–10 injections per tumor. Thus, 1 × 108 TU/100 µl PHSPTK/lentivirus were directly injected into the tumor mass.
Two days after the gene therapy, the 0.032 inch MRIHG
was inserted into the gene-targeted tumor for local
heating at 45°C for 20 min. A 2.7 mm micro-thermometry
fiber was placed in parallel to the MRIHG, to instantly
measure the temperature changes caused by RFH at the
target tumor (Supplementary Figure S2). Subsequently,
intraperitoneal GCV (25 mg/kg) was administered every
2 days for 14 days.

Statistical analyses were performed by one-way
ANOVA to compare in vitro gene expression rates, cell
killing efficacies, and apoptosis indices. Two-way ANOVA
was performed to compare in vivo tumor sizes among
different subject groups at three time points. A p-value
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

GRANT SUPPORT
This study was supported by a China 973 Program
(2014CB744505), National Natural Science Foundation
of China (Grant No. 81401504, 81430040, 81571738),

2014PYA010), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science
Foundation of China (LY15H180003), and National
Institutes of Health grant (R01EB012467).

MRI
Mice were mechanically ventilated with 1–3%
isoflurane mixed with 0.5 l/min oxygen for MRI followup. MRI was performed with a 3.0-Tesla MR scanner
(GE Healthcare Corporation, Chicago, USA) by placing
the mouse into a 100 mm-diameter micro-imaging
coil. T2-weighted images (T2WI) were acquired by
rapid acquisition with the following OAx T2 FSE spin
echo sequence: TR/TE = 2660/80 ms, field of view =
8 cm, matrix = 256 × 256, section thickness = 1.5 mm,
intersection gap = 0.5 mm, NEX = 2, and total scan time
= 1 min and 51 sec. MRI was performed on days 0, 7, and
14 after the gene therapy. In this study, tumor growth was
followed up for up to two weeks and combination therapy
did not prolong overall survival after the treatments. This is
because the human breast cancer xenografts developed in
this study grew fast, posing the risk that those in the control
group could reach a large size (over 10% body weight),
which is not permitted by the IACUC in this study.

After achieving satisfactory MRI, the animals were
euthanized and tumors were harvested. The volume (V)
of each tumor mass was calculated with the following
formula: V = A*B2/2 (where A is the longer diameter and
B is the shorter one) [4]. Because of variation in tumor
size, the relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated with
the following formula: RTV = Vn/V0 (where Vn = tumor
volume on day 7 or 14 post-treatment and V0 = tumor
volume pre-treatment). Then, the tumor tissues were
examined using different laboratory methods, including
(i) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to confirm the
formation of breast tumors; and (ii) terminal dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) to examine cell apoptosis. The
number of apoptotic cells was counted by Image-Pro Plus
6 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA).
