ABSTRACT:
Despite their ubiquitous expression and high conservation during evolution,
precise cellular functions of vault ribonucleoparticles, mainly built of multiple major
vault protein (MVP) copies, are still enigmatic. With regard to cancer, vaults were
shown to be upregulated during drug resistance development as well as malignant
transformation and progression. Such in a previous study we demonstrated that human
astrocytic brain tumours including glioblastoma are generally high in vault levels while
MVP expression in normal brain is comparably low. However a direct contribution to
the malignant phenotype in general and that of glioblastoma in particular has not
been established so far. Thus we address the questions whether MVP itself has a
pro-tumorigenic function in glioblastoma. Based on a large tissue collection, we reconfirm strong MVP expression in gliomas as compared to healthy brain. Further,
the impact of MVP on human glioblastoma aggressiveness was analysed by using
gene transfection, siRNA knock-down and dominant-negative genetic approaches.
Our results demonstrate that MVP/vaults significantly support migratory and invasive
competence as well as starvation resistance of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. The
enhanced aggressiveness was based on MVP-mediated stabilization of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling axis.
Consequently, MVP overexpression resulted in enhanced growth and brain invasion
in human glioblastoma xenograft models. Our study demonstrates, for the first time,
that vaults have a tumour-promoting potential by stabilizing EGFR/PI3K-mediated
migration and survival pathways in human glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

and the invasion of tumour cells into the adjacent tissue
making total surgical resection mostly unachievable
[3]. The successful chemotherapeutic treatment of brain
tumours is mainly limited by the blood-brain-barrier and
the expression of ABC-transporter proteins, acting as drug
efflux pumps [4]. Another protein frequently linked with
drug resistance is the major vault protein (MVP), also

Human glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV,
GBM) represents the most common and aggressive form
of primary brain tumour in adults with a median survival
of less than 15 months [1]. This dismal prognosis is based
on both, the resistance to current therapeutic options [2]

known as lung resistance protein (LRP) [5]. MVP forms
the outer shell of the vault, a large and highly abundant
ribonucleoparticle complex [6]. In addition to MVP, vaults
contain vault poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (vPARP),
telomerase-associated protein (TEP-1) and several small
untranslated RNAs (vRNA) [7-9]. Multiple in vitro studies
demonstrated that MVP is almost generally overexpressed
in drug-resistant human cancer cells selected against
diverse chemotherapeutic agents [10]. However, the role
of MVP and vaults in drug resistance is controversially
discussed [5, 11, 12].
Vaults are widely expressed in eukaryotic organisms
including humans but surprisingly are missing e.g. in flies,
worms and plants [9]. Due to their hollow-barrel structure
which can dynamically open and close, vaults were
suggested to be involved in transport mechanisms [5, 7,
13]. Consequently, vaults are of interest in nanotechnology
and are currently developed as natural nano-capsules e.g.
for drug delivery applications [14]. Furthermore, vaults
participate in the regulation and fine-tuning of a variety
of intracellular signal pathways, including mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) signalling [9]. Additionally, our group has
identified MVP as an interferon-stimulated gene regulating
phosphorylation and hence nuclear translocation of STAT1
[15].
In the healthy human organism the highest levels
of vaults are found in tissues potentially exposed to
exo- or endotoxins like the epithelia of the lung and the
gastrointestinal tract as well as in macrophages [16].
During malignant transformation or cancer progression
MVP expression is initiated or upregulated in various
tumours [9] including gliomas [17]. Nevertheless a
definite tumour-promoting function of vaults has not been
conclusively worked out so far.
Previously, our group and others have reported
constitutive upregulation of vaults in cells and tissues
of astrocytic brain tumours [17-19]. Consequently,
we investigated in this study the impact of MVP
overexpression on growth dynamics and aggressiveness of
human GBM in vitro and in vivo. Our data assign -for the
first time- a tumour-promoting function to vault particles
overexpressed in many cancer types [5].

were comparably low in MVP mRNA (Figure 1A).
Consistent data regarding MVP mRNA expression
upregulation in human GBM were derived from diverse
in silico datasets like https://www.genevestigator.com/
gv/ (data not shown). Immunofluorescence staining of
MVP revealed a dotted, cytoplasmic distribution pattern
indicating formation of vault particles in human GBM
cells (shown representatively in the MVP-positive
GBM cell line MR-1 in Figure 1B). Out of all patientderived primary cultures and cell lines analysed, only
one GBM cell model, namely H7, almost completely
lacked MVP. Consequently we established stable MVPoverexpressing (H7/MVP) and corresponding empty
vector control subclones (H7/vc) to analyse the impact
on GBM cell behaviour. Selection for MVP-positive
clones was significantly more efficient as compared to
the vector control already indicating a positive impact of
MVP expression on H7 clonogenic cell survival (Figure
1C and D). Comparably to the endogenous MVP, also
ectopically expressed MVP localized mainly to dotted,
preferentially cytoplasmic structures (Figure 1E). Vault
particle formation in H7/MVP cells was also confirmed
by 1) 100000×g centrifugation leading to complete MVP
pelleting and 2) accumulation of MVP to the 45% fraction
in sucrose-gradient centrifugation [10] (Figure 1F). All
MVP-positive subclones displayed distinctly changed
spindle-shaped morphology as compared to parental and
vector control-transfected H7 cells (Figure 1G).

MVP supports the migratory potential of GBM
cells
Wound-healing assays demonstrated that ectopic
MVP expression significantly increased cell migration
at all time-points analysed (Figure 2A). This MVPsupported migration was even more pronounced in
transwell-chamber experiments (Figure 2B) where only
MVP-overexpressing cells were able to cross the pores
of the filter. Accordingly, videomicroscopy revealed
a robust migratory activity of H7/MVP cells and only
minor cell displacements of the vector controls (Figure
2C; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). In order to confirm
that the migratory potential was indeed mediated by
vaults, siRNA experiments were performed in MVPtransfected and endogenously MVP-expressing GBM cell
models. MVP-targeting siRNA reduced MVP expression
at the mRNA (Supplementary Figure S1A) and protein
(compare Figure 4C) levels by around 50-60%. Higher
efficacy was unobtainable owing to the extended half-life
of MVP assembled into vaults [15]. However, already this
partial knock-down resulted in a significant reversal of the
migratory phenotype in MVP-transfected H7 cells (Figure
2D) while vector control cells remained widely migrationincompetent (Supplementary Figure S1B). Accordingly,
MVP siRNA significantly attenuated transwell migration
in several endogenously MVP-expressing GBM cell

reduce the amount of intact vault particles more efficiently,
a dominant-negative EGFP-MVP deletion variant
(dnMVP) was expressed in GBM cells (compare Material

and Methods; Supplementary Figure S2A). Also dnMVP
distinctly reduced the migratory potential of MVP-positive
GBM cell models as compared to the empty vector control
(Figure 2E) again suggesting an important contribution of

expressing cells (Figure 3A) corresponding to a reduced
tendency towards spontaneous cell death induction
(Figure 3B). Accordingly, only in the MVP-positive
GBM cell models knockdown of MVP moderately but
significantly upregulated the spontaneous cell death rate
(Figure 3C; Supplementary Figure S2B). This suggests
that vaults support GBM cell survival specifically under
the stress of low density seeding. Correspondingly, MVP

MVP-mediated upregulation of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway promotes migration and
starvation resistance in human GBM cells

by MVP siRNA (Figure 3D). In accordance, interference
with endogenous MVP expression/function by siRNA
or dnMVP specifically reduced clonogenic growth in all
tested GBM cell lines (Figure 3E and F).
When the impact of MVP expression on GBM
cell survival was tested under serum starvation stress,
the differences became even more distinct. MVPoverexpressing H7 cells were mostly resistant against
long-term starvation (75% viable cells after 5 days
without serum and growth factors), whereas the majority
(mean = 92%) of MVP-negative vector control cells
underwent apoptosis in this setting (Figure 3G). Data from
microscopic evaluation were confirmed by performing
viability-indicative ATP assays (Figure 3H).

Vaults have been shown to interact with several
intracellular signal cascades including the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway known to exert important roles in survival
of diverse stress conditions and cell migration [20, 21].
Thus, we decided to investigate whether an impact on
this pathway plays a role in MVP-mediated GBM cell
survival and migration. Indeed, phosphorylation of the
PI3K pathway mediators AKT and S6 was upregulated in
total protein extracts of MVP-overexpressing H7 cells and
this effect was more pronounced under serum withdrawal
(Figure 4A). Correspondingly, blockade of MVP by

cells seeded at low density (2x104) in 6 well plates was monitored every other day for 2 weeks. The experiment was repeated twice leading
to comparable results. B. and C. Spontaneous cell death was determined by Hoechst33258/propidium iodide staining at day three after
seeding (B) or following siRNA-mediated MVP downregulation at day 4 after transfection (C). The percentage of PI-positive cells (dead)
relative to the total cell number (Hoechst-positive) was calculated. D. Clonogenic survival potential was compared between H7/MVP and
H7/vc cells 7 days after seeding (left panel) or 8 days after siRNA-mediated MVP down-modulation (middle and right panels). Bar graphs
represent the cell number counted in 4 defined optical fields per well. E. Clonogenicity was determined in U373 and RAEW cells 8 days
after siRNA-mediated MVP down-modulation. F. Impact of a dominant-negative MVP variant (dnMVP) on clonogenicity of U373 cells
was determined 8 days after infection. E and F. The crystal violet absorbance was determined as optical density (OD) at 560nm. B-F. Bar

reduced phosphorylation of AKT and even stronger of
S6 in MVP-expressing cell models only. To analyse
whether this PI3K pathway upregulation is involved in
the MVP-mediated effects on GBM migration, scratch
assays with the mTOR and PI3K inhibitors temsirolimus
and LY294002, respectively, were performed. Both drugs
completely reversed the higher migratory potential of H7/

MVP cells to levels of the vector control (Figure 4D).
Correspondingly, the profoundly enhanced survival of
the MVP-expressing subline under serum withdrawal was
almost completely reversed already by 1 nM temsirolimus
(Figure 4E, upper panel). Similarly, clonogenic survival
was significantly reduced by mTOR blockade specifically
in the H7 MVP-positive background (Figure 4E, lower
panel) and all endogenously MVP-expressing GBM cell

against different PI3K signalling cascade molecules, it
turned out that MVP-overexpressing cells were not only
hypersensitive against blockade of mTOR and PI3K,
but also the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (Supplementary
Figure S5). This suggests that enhanced PI3K signalling
in MVP-overexpressing cells might at least in part be
based on hyperactivation of the EGFR. Accordingly,
only the MVP-transfected H7 subline significantly

responded to EGF stimulation by enhanced proliferation
(Figure 5A). Additionally, the migratory phenotype of
H7/MVP cells -detectable also under serum starvationwas markedly enhanced by EGF while H7/vc cells
remained unresponsive (Figure 5B). Correspondingly,
the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, comparable to LY294002
and temsirolimus (compare Figure 4D), completely
reversed the MVP-mediated migratory potential (Figure

5C). EGF stimulation of serum-starved cells induced
hyperactivation of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways in
the MVP-positive background (Figure 5D, quantification
in Supplementary Figure S6A). Accordingly, we
observed a MVP-mediated upregulation of EGFR in both
membrane-enriched and postnuclear supernatant protein
fractions of H7 cells (Figure 5E). Furthermore, video
analysis of EGFP-MVP revealed enhanced translocation
of vault particles to distinct membrane-subdomains and
ruffling edges in response to EGF stimulation especially
under starved conditions (Supplementary Figure S6B,
Supplementary Movie 3 and 4). In contrast, siRNAmediated downregulation of endogenous (RAEW)
and transfected (H7/MVP) MVP under serum-starved,
EGF-stimulated conditions resulted in decreased EGFR
expression and reduced AKT and S6 phosphorylation
(Figure 5F). Summarizing, these data suggest that MVP
enhances responsiveness of human GBM cells to the EGF/
EGFR signalling axis by upregulating EGFR levels at the
GBM cell membrane.

adverse prognosis [5]. Additionally, chemotherapy failure
and radiation resistance have been frequently linked
to enhanced MVP/vault expression [5, 25]. However
a possible direct contribution of vaults to malignant
phenotypes remains largely unexplored. Here we
demonstrate that MVP supports aggressiveness of human
GBM cells and xenografts by fostering an EGFR/PI3K/
AKT pathway-mediated migratory/invasive potential as
well as starvation resistance.
In a survey of human tissues and organs, brain
was found to be characterized by comparably low MVP
expression levels with only the microglia displaying
clear-cut immunohistochemical staining [16, 26]. Thus,
in an earlier study, we were surprised to detect an almost
constitutive and intense overexpression of MVP in
astrocytic brain tumour-derived cell lines [17]. In the
present study, we now re-confirm activation of MVP gene
expression in human gliomas as compared to normal
brain based on extended expression array data sets. In
accordance, overexpression of MVP in human glioma
tissues has also been reported by other groups [18, 19].
The molecular mechanisms and signals underlying the
activation of MVP expression in gliomas are still unknown.
Interestingly, however, enhanced levels of MVP were
repeatedly found in epileptic brain areas and considered
as a possible factor causing failure of treatment with antiepileptic drugs [27-29]. Moreover, considerable amounts
of MVP were also present in explanted primary astrocytes
suggesting that the induction of MVP expression might
represent a more general stress-induced protection signal
of neuroectodermal cells [17]. Accordingly, upregulation
of MVP was also found as a consequence of neuronal/
spinal injury in several model species including rat [30],
electric ray [31] and zebrafish [32]. A direct functional
involvement of MVP in neuroregeneration was proven in
a spinal cord injury zebrafish model [32]. Together these
observations implicate a stress/injury-inducible, survivaland migration-promoting function of vaults in the central
nervous system.
With regard to gliomas, our present study suggests
that such MVP-mediated migration- and survivalpromoting functions are also activated during the
malignant transformation/progression of astrocytes.
Concerning cell migration, several previous studies
reported that at different stages of evolution vaults are
highly expressed in diverse cells with motile potential
from Dictyostelium amoeba up to mature human dendritic
cells, macrophages and the microglia [16, 26, 33, 34].
The hypothesis on a promigratory function of vaults,
has now been proven in our GBM cell models by both
up- and down-regulation of the migratory GBM cell
potential following MVP overexpression and knockdown, respectively. Additionally, we observed distinctly
enhanced brain invasion induced by MVP over-expression
in an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft. Consequently,
GBM-associated MVP activation might have direct

MVP overexpression in human GBM induces
increased aggressiveness in vivo
To test the in vivo relevance of the in vitro data,
H7/MVP and vector control cells were transplanted both
subcutaneously and orthotopically into SCID mice. At
the subcutaneous location MVP induced significantly
enhanced tumour growth of H7 cells and resulted in a
distinctly reduced survival time of mice (Figure 6A and B).
Protein extracts of tumours revealed stable overexpression
of the MVP transgene during in vivo tumour formation
(Western blot inset in Figure 6A). Accordingly, when
injected orthotopically into the brain (Figure 6C) the
number of mitotic cells (Figure 6D) was enhanced in
histological sections of the MVP-positive cell model.
Additionally, the number of apoptotic figures was, like
under in vitro conditions, significantly reduced by MVP
transfection (Figure 6E). Strikingly, MVP-overexpression
induced distinct tissue invasion into normal brain with
fissured margins and multiple Ki-67-positive tumour
islets invading the surrounding brain parenchyma (Figure
6C and F). Immunohistochemical staining proved besides
the stable expression of transfected MVP during xenograft
growth (Figure 6G) also an enhanced number of cells
stained positively for phosphorylated AKT (Figure 6H and
6I). Taken together these data suggest that MVP induces
pro-survival and pro-migratory phenotypes in GBM cells
leading to enhanced tumour aggressiveness in vivo.

DISCUSSION
With regard to malignant progression, enhanced
levels of MVP and vault particles have been reported in

clinical relevance considering that diffuse invasion
is, besides therapy resistance, the main cause of the
devastating prognosis of GBM patients [35, 36].
A second distinct consequence of MVP
overexpression was uncovered by culturing glioblastoma
cells under serum-starved conditions. Both overexpression
and knock-down experiments indicated a major role of
MVP in preventing apoptosis induction as a consequence
of growth factor deficiency. In accordance, MEFs from
MVP-deficient mice were hypersensitive to serum
withdrawal reacting with enhanced apoptosis induction
[37]. Interestingly, also knock-out of the two MVP genes
present in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum
resulted in growth defects specifically under starvation
conditions [33]. Together these observations suggest
an evolutionary conserved role of vaults in starvation
resistance. Additionally, Rhy et al. reported on enhanced
MVP expression as a contributor to aging-associated
apoptosis resistance against diverse stress signals in
human fibroblasts [38]. These protective functions might
be hijacked in the malignant tissue where cancer cells are
constantly threatened by shortage in oxygen and nutrition.
One important intracellular signalling pathway
known to be able to mediate both migratory competence
and starvation resistance is the PI3K/mTOR/AKT cascade
[20, 21] activated by diverse potentially oncogenic receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) including the EGFR. With regard
to GBM, inhibition of the PI3K pathway by knock-down
strategies resulted in decreased proliferation, migration,
and invasion [39]. Several previous observations have
suggested that vaults might interfere with the PI3K
cell survival signal axis. Thus an MVP-mediated, cytoprotective effect against hyperosmotic stress was found
to be dependent on enhanced PI3K pathway activation
in SW620 colon cancer cells [40]. Additionally, the first
intracellular signalling regulator found to interact with
MVP was the PI3K antagonist and tumour suppressor
PTEN [24], frequently deregulated in human GBM
by gene deletion, mutation, promoter methylation or
miRNA mediated suppression [41, 42]. Subsequently, two
studies by the group of C. Eng reported MVP-mediated
nuclear translocation of PTEN which might sequester
this phosphatase away from its lipid substrates at the
cell membrane [22, 23]. In accordance with these data,
we found enhanced levels of PTEN in nuclear extracts
but reduced levels in membrane-enriched fractions of
MVP-transfected GBM cells. These data suggest that
vaults might support PI3K activation by PTEN inhibition.
However, small molecule kinase inhibitor studies revealed
that not only blockade of PI3K and mTOR but also of
EGFR, one of the major oncogenic RTK molecules in
human GBM [43], completely reversed the effects of
MVP on GBM cell migration and starvation resistance.
Thus we hypothesized that EGFR hyperactivation might
synergize with PTEN inhibition in MVP-mediated
PI3K signal stabilization and consequently GBM

aggressiveness. Accordingly, regulation of MVP tyrosylphosphorylation by SHP-2 was suggested to support
EGF-mediated MAPK pathway activation but probably
also IGF-driven PI3K/AKT survival signals in fibroblasts
[37]. Indeed, we found that MVP has a profound impact
on EGFR expression levels and EGF-responsiveness of
our GBM cell models. Interestingly, this seems to be a
lineage-specific effect since in the case of hepatoma cell
lines we observed gefitinib resistance as a consequence
of MVP overexpression [44]. This might rely on the fact
that alterations in EGFR are pivotal and very frequent in
primary human GBM but not hepatoma. Accordingly, an
association between MVP expression and the proteomic
signalling network activated by the oncogenic EGFRvIII
variant in GBM cells was reported recently [19]. Video
analysis of GBM cells revealed that the transport of vault
particles to distinct membrane-subdomains and ruffling
edges was enhanced in response to EGF stimulation
especially under growth factor-starved conditions. This
suggests that MVP might directly interact with EGFR or a
binding partner leading to enhanced protein stabilization
or altered receptor recycling rates. These possibilities are
addressed by on-going projects in our lab.
Taken together our data demonstrate, to the best
of our knowledge for the first time, that vault particles
contribute to cancer aggressiveness. We found that MVP
expression is almost constitutively activated during
malignant transformation in tumours of astrocytic
origin and supports EGFR/PI3K signalling pathway
activation leading to enhanced starvation resistance
and migration/invasion potential. A possible quality of
MVP overexpression as predictive marker for GBM
responsiveness to EGFR, PI3K or mTOR targeting agents,
as suggested by our transgenic cell models, needs to be
addressed using well-characterized patient material from
controlled clinical studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and chemicals
Temsirolimus was obtained from Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals Inc. Erlotinib was generously supplied
by Roche and LY294002 was obtained from LC Labs. All
solutions were freshly prepared before use. All other drugs
were purchased from Sigma.

Cell lines, primary cell cultures and human tissue
U373 GBM and A549 NSCLC cells were obtained
from the ATCC and grown in minimal essential medium
(MEM) (PAA) containing 10% FCS (PAA), 1 mM sodium
pyruvate and 1% non-essential amino acids and in RPMI1640 medium (PAA) with 10% FCS, respectively. RAEW

cells, established at the Department of Neurosurgery,
Wagner-Jauregg Hospital in Linz, were cultured in
RPMI-1640. Furthermore, MR-1 GBM cells were kindly
provided by Dr. T. Kurata, Tokyo, Japan and were grown
in RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS. The H7 GBM cell line was
established at the Institute of Cancer Research, Vienna
from a 39 years old male patient diagnosed with GBM.
All cell lines and subclones used were authenticated by
array-comparative genomic hybridization [45] and DNA
fingerprinting and periodically checked for Mycoplasma
contamination (Mycoplasma Stain Kit; Sigma).

with 4mM glutamine. The culture plate was kept in a 37
°C custom designed incubator built around an inverted
phase-contrast microscope (World Precision Instruments).
Images of 3 neighbouring microscopic fields were taken
at five-minute intervals for 1 day before and 2 days after
treatment with 50ng/ml EGF. Images from the phase
contrast microscope were analysed for migration data
with a cell-tracking program enabling manual marking of
individual cells and recording their position parameters
into data files. The parameter “migrated distance” was
calculated by averaging for each cell the displacement for
each time interval up to 24 hours. For each condition at
least 20 cells were tracked from different fields of view
and all experiments were repeated twice. Cell proliferation
index was also assessed on the basis of the videos by
counting cell divisions within the first 48 hours after EGF
stimulation.

Stable MVP expression
Stable MVP-overexpressing H7 cell clones and the
corresponding vector control cells were established as
described previously [46].

Protein isolation, cell fractionation and Western
blot analysis

Silencing of MVP
For transient gene silencing cells were transduced
with ON-TARGETplus SmartPOOL siRNA for MVP
or for control siRNA (Dharmacon) as described [44].
Oligofectamine (Life Technologies) was used as
transfection reagent.

Total cellular protein extracts were isolated from
untreated semiconfluent cell cultures grown in T-25
cm2 flasks. For knock-down experiments proteins were
extracted 4 days after siRNA transfection or adenoviral
infection. After evaluation of protein concentrations
using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce),
immunoblots were performed as described [44]. Isolation
of 100000xg protein fractions and sucrose gradient
centrifugation were performed as described [10, 50]. Cell
membranes were isolated as published [51]. For extraction
of postnuclear supernatant and nuclear protein fractions
the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit
was used (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following
primary antibodies were diluted 1 : 1000 in TBS with
3% BSA and 0,1% Tween: MVP monoclonal mouse
clone 42 (Transduction Laboratories), phospho-ERK1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204), ERK1/2, phospho-S6 ribosomal
protein (Ser240/244), S6, phospho-AKT (Ser473), AKT,
PTEN and EGFR were all purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. ß-actin AC-15 and lamin A/C antibodies
were both obtained from Sigma. The immunoreactive
bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labelled
antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For band
quantification the QuantiScan software (Biosoft) was used.

Migration assays
Cell migration was tested by wound-healing or
transwell-chamber assays. Confluent monolayers were
wounded using a sterile 200 µl tip and treated with the
respective kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, LY294002 and
temsirolimus). Photomicrographs from at least three fixed
positions of scratches were taken at 0, 24 and 48 hours
on a Nikon Eclipse inverted microscope. Gap-width was
determined using Tscratch software [47]. Results were
calculated as percentage open area relative to the starting
gaps after 24 and 48 hours. Transwell-chamber assays
were performed as published [48]. The migratory potential
was analysed by counting crystal violet-positive cells of
at least 4 defined fields at the bottom of each filter (Image
J software, National Institutes of Health). Alternatively,
migrated cells were destained using a 2% SDS solution
and absorbance of free crystal violet was measured at
560nm. All experiments were performed in duplicates and
repeated at least twice.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

Videomicroscopy analysis

Consecutive tissue sections from formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded brain specimens were deparaffinised
and rehydrated. After heating for 10 min in 10mM citrate
buffer (pH 6.0), the slides were incubated overnight at 4°C
with LRP-56 (for MVP, 1:20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and p-AKT (Ser473; 1:25; Cell Signalling Technology)
antibodies, respectively. To evaluate proliferation, sections

For migration analysis [49] 50 000 cells were plated
in each well of a 24-well plate with complete growth
medium. After overnight cell attachment the medium
was changed to CO2-independent medium (Gibco-BRL
Life Technologies, UK) without FCS but supplemented

Subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts

were stained with the Ki-67 (clone MiB-1) antibody from
DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark; 1: 100) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Binding of primary antibodies was detected
with the UltraVision LP detection system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
followed by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and
counterstaining with haematoxylin. Haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining were used to localize the tumour
mass in the brain and to count the number of apoptotic
and mitotic cells. The percentage of pAKT-positive,
apoptotic and mitotic cells were evaluated by counting
at least four visual fields per slide microscopically. With
regard to invasive potential, the number of Ki-67-positive
islets without junction with the primary tumour mass of
at least 6 slides from 2 time points (20 and 30 days after
orthotopic transplantation) was determined.
For immunofluorescence cells were grown in
chamber slides and after attachment fixed with 4%
formalin/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by
permeabilization with 0.5% TritonX/PBS. All further
procedures were done as described [15]. The following
primary and secondary antibodies were used: LRP-56
and PTEN as listed above, (all 1:50 in PBS/1% BSA),
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled anti-mouse (F1010) or anti-rabbit (F-9887) and tetramethyl rhodamine
isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labelled anti-mouse (T6528) (all
1:500; Sigma). Actin filaments were visualized with FITCphalloidin staining (1:500; Sigma). Stained cells were
mounted with DAPI (Vectorshield) and further analysed
using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss Invert
Axio Observer.Z1, Two-channel LSM 700 URGB)
equipped with LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 25x/0.8 Imm
Korr DIC M27 and EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.3 Oil DIC
M27 objective lenses. Digital images were taken using the
Zeiss ZEN (2011) software.

Six- to 8-week-old female, immunodeficient C.B17/IcrHsd-Prkcdscid SCID mice were purchased from
Harlan and kept in a pathogen-free environment. For
subcutaneous tumour formation 1 x 106 H7/MVP and H7/
vc cells were injected into the right flanks of mice. Animals
were continually controlled for distress development
and tumour size was determined as described [48].
Orthotopically growing brain tumours were generated by
injection of 1 x 105 or 1 x 106 H7/MVP and H7/vc cells
into the striatum of mouse brain as described earlier [53].
Cell injection was carried out in anaesthesized animals
using Lab Standard Stereotaxic Instrument supplied
with Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelting) at
constant speed 0.5 µl/min. At 10, 20 and 30 days after
cell injection mice were euthanized under anaesthesia by
transcardial perfusion using PBS and Accustain solution
(Sigma). Brains were post-fixed by immersion in the
Accustain fixative for at least 12 hours at 4 °C. After
paraffin embedding, tissues were further analysed. All
experiments were performed according to the Federation
of Laboratory Animal Science Association guidelines
for the use of experimental animals and approved by the
institutional ethics committee and Austrian government
authorities (BMWF-68.205/0064-II/3b/2011 and BMWF66.009/0157-II/10b/2008).

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical
significance of differences was analysed by using unpaired
Student´s t-test or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate
followed by Bonferroni post-tests. Survival analysis was
performed using Kaplan–Meier curves. A p-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Throughout the
study the following classification is used: *, p < 0.05; **,
p < 0.01 ***, p < 0.001.

Cell viability, cell death, and clonogenic assays
For cell viability 3 × 103 cells were seeded into 96well plates and 24 hours later cells were exposed to drugs
as indicated. Activity of anticancer drugs was screened by
MTT assay (EZ4U, Biomedica). Additionally, cell survival
was measured 5 days after serum withdrawal by CellTiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability assay (Promega). Cell
death rates were determined by simultaneous staining
with Hoechst33258 and propidium iodide as published
[52]. For clonogenic assays, cells were seeded (in the
respective experiments 24 hours after transfection or viral
infection) at a density of 3 × 103 cells per well into 6-well
plates and monitored for at least 7 days. In drug exposure
experiments, 24 hours after seeding cells were treated with
the respective drugs for 6 days. Cells were stained with
crystal violet and either counted using Image J software,
or quantified by densitometry as described above.
