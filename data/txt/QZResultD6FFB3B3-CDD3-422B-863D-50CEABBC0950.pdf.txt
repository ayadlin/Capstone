Abstract
Aging is the predominant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and contributes
to a considerably more severe outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, is a caloric restriction mimetic with
potential anti-aging properties which has emerged as a beneficial nutraceutical for
patients with cardiovascular disease. Although resveratrol is widely consumed as a
nutritional supplement, its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated fully. Here,
we report that resveratrol activates human nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
(NAMPT), SIRT4 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in human aortic
smooth muscle cells. Similar observations were obtained in resveratrol treated
C57BL/6J mouse heart and liver tissues. Resverotrol can also augment telomerase
activity in both human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and A549 cells.
Blocking NAMPT and SIRT4 expression prevents induction of hTERT in human aortic
smooth muscle cells while overexpression of NAMPT elevates the telomerase activity
induced by resveratrol in A549 cells. Together, these results identify a NAMPT-SIRT4hTERT axis as a novel mechanism by which resveratrol may affect the anti-aging
process in human aortic smooth muscle cells, mouse hearts and other cells. These
findings enrich our understanding of the positive effects of resveratrol in human
cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction

disease. During the past decade dietary supplementation
with the plant-derived polyphenol resveratrol
(3,5,4´-trihydroxystilbene) has emerged as a promising
approach to counteract age-induced pro-atherogenic
phenotypic changes in the vasculature. Resveratrol has
been shown to exert significant anti-aging actions in
vertebrates [3]. Resveratrol induced gene expression
patterns resembled those induced by caloric restriction
(CR) and delayed aging-related deterioration [4]. Both
resveratrol and CR have beneficial effects in various
mammalian models of aging and cardiovascular diseases

Aging is the predominant risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases [1] and contributes to a
significantly more severe outcome in patients with
acute myocardial infarction [2]. These risks are partly
attributable to an age-related decline in the ability of
vascular cells to resist stress and effectively remodel
the arterial wall. Vascular smooth muscle cells are
especially important in this regard. Strategies to prevent
the premature senescence of vascular smooth muscle
cells could be an effective approach for reducing vascular

effects of resveratrol in relation to coronary artery disease
can be found here [6]. Although significant progress has
been achieved in elucidating the cellular mechanisms
activated by resveratrol, the signal transduction pathway
and mechanisms of its effect in the vascular system
remains to be further elucidated.
One possible mechanism for the protective effects
of resveratrol is the preservation of telomere length.
Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences located at
the extreme ends of chromosomes and are considered to
be indicators of biological age. The telomerase enzyme
is responsible for the maintenance of telomeres through
the addition of nucleotides. Tchirkov and Lansdorp
proposed the importance of both sufficient telomerase
activity and maintenance of telomere length for aging in
primary human fibroblast [7]. Stimulation of the catalytic
subunit of telomerase, the telomerase reverse transcriptase
(TERT), stabilized telomere length and provided the cells
with unlimited replicative potential without generating
malignant properties [8]. Thus, telomerase reactivation
can prevent or delay the cellular aging process triggered
by significant telomere shortening.
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT),
also known as Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor
(PBEF) and Visfatin, is the rate-limiting enzyme for
NAD+ biosynthesis of a mammalian salvage pathway
from nicotinamide [9]. The intracellular levels of NAD+
and nicotinamide have recently been linked to cellular
responses necessary for cell survival. These response
pathways include members of the sirtuins, a family of
protein deactylases [10]. Overexpression of NAMPT has
been shown to increase SIRT1 activity [9], and protect
cells from apoptosis through activation of SIRT3 and
SIRT4 [11]. NAMPT has also been suggested to extend
the lifespan of human vascular smooth muscle cells by
activating SIRT1 and preventing the accumulation of p53
[12]. Therefore, because both resveratrol and NAMPT
have been shown to be effective protective agents in the
vasculature, we sought to identify a potential mechanistic
link between the two agents in their anti-aging effect.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that
resveratrol may trigger hTERT, which stabilizes telomere
length, in human aortic smooth muscle cells as a potential
mechanism for its role in the prevention and treatment
of vascular diseases. Our results indicate that resveratrol
treatment indeed leads to activation of hTERT. Further
investigation identified that hTERT activation is dependent
upon resveratrol first inducing the expression of NAMPT
followed by SIRT4. We present here evidence of a
NAMPT-SIRT4-hTERT axis as the novel mechanism of
anti-aging effects of resveratrol in human aortic smooth
muscle cells, and propose that this pathway contributes
to the positive outcomes observed in the vasculature that
coincide with increased exposure to resveratrol.

Resveratrol induces hTERT and telomerase
activity in human Aortic Smooth Muscle, A549,
and HMVEC-L cells
To examine whether resveratrol can induce hTERT
expression and determine the optimum dose and time
course of its potential effect in human ASM cells, we
performed Western blots to assess hTERT protein levels in
resveratrol treated cells compared to those in control cells.
As shown in Fig.1 A and C resveratrol at concentrations
of 25, 50 and 100 μM significantly induced 2.3±0.2,
2.4±0.3, 1.8±0.1 fold increases of hTERT compared to
DMSO reagent treated controls, respectively. Based on
this observation, we used a 50 μM dose of resveratrol for
the time course experiment. As shown in Fig.1B, when
we treated ASM cells with 50 µM of resveratrol over a
period of 24 h, we determined that resveratrol induced
hTERT expression which peaked at 6 h after treatment
with a 3.6±0.3 fold increase compared to controls (Fig.
1D). Thus, we selected a dosage of 50 μM and the 6 h time
point of resveratrol treatment for most of our experiments.
To examine whether the resveratrol effect is due to
an increase in the levels of hTERT mRNA, we performed
semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of hTERT mRNA in
resveratrol treated human aortic smooth muscle cells. As
shown in Fig. 1E and F, an increase in hTERT mRNA level
was observed at 3 h post resveratrol treatment by 1.9±0.1
fold compared to untreated controls. hTERT mRNA levels
were also upregulated by 1.6±0.2 fold compared to control
after 6 h of resveratrol treatment. These observations
were validated further by qRT-PCR analyses showing
that resveratrol upregulated hTERT expression to 2.3±0.1
and 3.6±0.5 fold after 3 and 6 h, respectively. (Fig.
S1B). These results suggest that upregulation of hTERT
by resveratrol is mainly via its effect on the increase of
hTERT mRNA level.
Moreover, we applied the TRAPeze Gel-Based
Telomerase Detection Assay to check if resveratrol
increases telomerase activity. The resulting gel image
from ASM cells (Fig. 1G), shows that the 36-bp standard
internal control band (S-IC) is observed with similar pixel
density in every lane except the TRS8 template control
lane, suggesting a high efficiency of PCR amplification
and an equal amount of protein analyzed for each reaction.
The cell lysate for the telomerase positive control cells
(provided with the kit), lane PC, showed a ladder pattern
of PCR products with 6-base increments starting at 50
nucleotides (i.e. 50, 56, 62, 68, and so forth). Cells were
considered positive for telomerase activity when a 36bp internal control band and a ladder of PCR products
with 6-base increments similar to that of the telomerasepositive control lane were present (Fig. 1G, Lane PC).

There were no obvious TRAP product ladders detected
in untreated ASM cells (Lane Cntl). However, after ASM
cells were treated with 50 µM resveratrol for 3 h, the lane
showed a very weak ladder pattern. After 6 h treatment,
the TRAP products were observed clearly, similar to the
positive cells. Our TRAPeze assay data indicated that
resveratrol increases telomerase activity in ASM cells,
especially at the 6 h treatment time point.
Increased telomerase activity was also observed
in A549 and HMVEC-L cells (Fig. 1H and I). Unlike
ASM cells, in which telomerase activity in controls was
undetectable, untreated A549 cells and HMVEC-L cells
were positive for telomerase activity. However, after
treatment with resveratrol for 3 and 6 h, the telomerase
activities in A549 cells increased in a time-dependent
manor (Fig. 1H). In addition, increased telomerase
activity was also observed in HMVEC-L cells after 6 h of
treatment with resveratrol (Fig. 1I).
Pixel densities within all DNA bands above 50 bp
for each sample were measured to quantify the resveratrol
induced telomerase activity. Our data showed that
telomerase activity was increased significantly to 3.8±0.3,
1.7±0.2 and 2.5±0.3 fold following 6 hrs of reveratrol
treatment relative to DMSO treated controls in ASM
(Fig. 1J), A549 (Fig. 1K), and HMVEC-L (Fig. 1L) cells,
respectively.
The above data collectively suggest that resveratrol
not only induced human TERT both at the protein and
mRNA levels in ASM cells, but also increased telomerase
activity in ASM, A549, and HMVEC-L cells.

fold changes, respectively, compared to DMSO controls
(Fig. 2 A and 2B). Second, we performed a time course
experiment over 24 h using 50 μM of resveratrol (Fig.

To investigate whether resveratrol also induces
NAMPT expression, we quantified NAMPT protein in
resveratrol treated ASM cells. First, we performed a doseresponse experiment (Fig. 2A). Treating cells with 50,
100, 200 µM of resveratrol significantly elevated cellular
NAMPT protein levels to 2.3±0.1, 2.4±0.1, and 2.3±0.2

2C). Our results show an increase in NAMPT beginning
at 3 h and reverting to the baseline by 24 h post treatment.
Resveratrol treatment induced positive fold changes in
NAMPT of 2.1±0.1, 2.5±0.1, and 2.4±0.2 compared
with untreated controls at 3, 6, and 12 h time points, as
evaluated by pixel density, respectively (Fig. 2D). Thus,
we also selected a dosage of 50 μM and a 6 h time point
of resveratrol treatment for the subsequent experiments.
To examine whether resveratrol’s effect on
NAMPT protein expression occurs at the mRNA level,
we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of
NAMPT mRNA in resveratrol treated human ASM cells.
In line with our Western blotting results, our RT-PCR
results clearly showed that at both 3 h and 6 h time points,
NAMPT mRNA was induced by resveratrol, particularly
at the 3 h time point (Fig. 2E), where there was a 1.5±0.1
fold increase compared to DMSO controls (Fig. 2F). These
observations were validated further by qRT-PCR analyses,
as resveratrol upregulated NAMPT expression 1.5±0.3 and
1.7±0.5 fold after 3 and 6 hours, respectively, compared to
untreated ASM cells (Fig. S1A).
These results suggest that upregulation of NAMPT
by resveratrol is mainly via its effect on the increase of
NAMPT mRNA levels rather than post-translational
regulation of protein level.

a 2.1±0.2 fold increase of NAMPT in the untreated group
of cells compared to the DMSO control. Similar results
were observed in the No RNA group of cells (Fig. 3B).
Resveratrol induced a 1.5±0.3 fold increase of hTERT,
and a 1.5±0.1 fold increase of NAMPT in the siRNAcntl group, but hTERT was not significantly increased in
siRNA-NAMPT treated cells (Fig. 3B).
Telomerase activity was also measured in ASM
cells in which NAMPT was knocked down (Fig. 3C). In
line with our data (Fig.1G), in no-siRNA treated cells,
telomerase activity was not detected, but after treatment
with resveratrol for 6 h, the TRAP bands appeared.
In siRNA-cntl cells, resveratrol treatment increased
telomerase activity. However, in the cells transfected
with siRNA against NAMPT, resveratrol did not elevate
telomerase activity to the same level as in siRNA-control
cells (Fig. 3C). Quantification of pixel densities within
bands above 50 bp showed that telomerase activity was
elevated 2.4±0.4; 2.1±0.2, and 1.1±0.2 fold following 6 hr
resveratrol treatment relative to the corresponding DMSO
treated controls in noRNA, siRNA control, and siRNANAMPT transfected ASM cells, respectively (Fig. 3D).

Resveratrol-induced hTERT expression in ASM
cells requires NAMPT
To address whether resveratrol-induced hTERT
is NAMPT-dependent, we transfected ASM cells with
NAMPT siRNA to knock down NAMPT and then assessed
whether resveratrol could still induce hTERT expression in
these cells. In this experiment, we used 4 groups of ASM
cells as shown in Fig.3: Untreated control group (UNT),
transfection reagents control group (NoRNA), NAMPT
knocked down with siRNA group (siRNA-NAMPT), and
siRNA control group (siRNA-cntl). NAMPT was knocked
down approximately 90% using NAMPT siRNA (Fig. 3A).
In the NAMPT-siRNA group, resveratrol’s ability to elicit
an increase in hTERT expression was abolished (Fig. 3A).
Resveratrol induced a 2.0±0.2 fold increase of hTERT, and

higher than in cells transfected with pCAGGS-NAMPT
(Fig.4A). We then performed the telomerase activity
assay on protein extracts isolated from the transfected
cells (Fig.4B). Our data showed that in H247E transfected
cells (H247EOE), resveratrol elevated telomerase activity
slightly, compared to the resveratrol-untreated cells.
In the case of the pCAGGS-NAMPT transfected cells
(NAMPTOE), larger, more intense TRAP product bands
were observed, along with additional bands between
36 bp and 50 bp in the cells treated with resveratrol
compared to both the untreated pCAGGS-NAMPT cells
and the resveratrol treated, pCAGGS-vector control

To explore further the role of NAMPT in
resveratrol-induced hTERT, A549 cells were transfected
with pCAGGS-vector (vector control), pCAGGS-NAMPT
or pCAGGS-NAMPT-H247E, a mutant NAMPT without

cells. According to the telomerase activity detection kit’s
manual, the extra bands appearing between 36 and 50 bp
suggests high telomerase activity.
Pixel densities within bands (shown in { in Fig.
4B) were measured and the telomerase activity was
induced by resveratrol to 1.8±0.3 fold of controls in A549
cells transfected with empty vector, while in the cells
transfected with either H247E or NAMPT expression
vectors, resveratrol induced 1.3±0.3 and 2.4±0.4 fold
increase in telomerase activity compared to DMSO treated
controls, respectively (Fig. 4C). These findings suggested
telomerase activity was increased further when NAMPT
was overexpressed.
These data suggest a pivotal role for NAMPT in
resveratrol-induced hTERT expression and telomerase
activity in both ASM and A549 cells.

The SIRT1 gene was upregulated by 1.3±0.1 and 1.6±0.1
after 3 and 6 hours, respectively (Fig. 5B). The expression
of SIRT3 and SIRT1 mRNA were validated further by
TaqMan qRT-PCR analyses showing that resveratrol
upregulated SIRT1 expression 1.6±0.1 and 1.6±0.2 fold
after 3 and 6 hours, respectively, compared to untreated
ASM cells (Fig. S1C). Protein levels of SIRT1 and SIRT4
were also investigated in response to resveratrol, as SIRT4
was the most modulated protein and SIRT1 was reported
to be target of resveratrol (16). Western blot results
showed that resveratrol induced SIRT4 after 1, 3, and 6
h treatment time and peaked at 3 h post treatment with a
1.9±0.1 fold change increase over untreated controls (Fig.
5C and 5E),while SIRT1 was induced by resveratrol at a
lower level than SIRT4 (Fig. 5D and 5F).
To test the hypothesis that upregulation of hTERT is
also SIRT4 dependant, we knocked down SIRT4 in ASM
cells using SIRT4 siRNA. SIRT4 was knocked down
approximately 80% by its cognate siRNA. Accordingly,
the effect of resveratrol on hTERT induction was
attenuated (Fig. 5G and 5H). Furthermore, we explored
the relationship between NAMPT and SIRT4 in this
pathway. SIRT4 knock down attenuated resveratrol
mediated hTERT upregulation but did not detectably
affect resveratrol mediated NAMPT upregulation (Fig.
5H). These results suggested that in addition to NAMPT,
resveratrol-induced hTERT is also SIRT4 dependent and
SIRT4 is down-stream of NAMPT in this process.

Resveratrol elevated the NAD+ plus NADH levels
in ASM cells
Intracellular NAMPT is an essential and ratelimiting enzyme in a key mammalian NAD+ biosynthetic
salvage pathway. As our data showed, resveratrol induced
NAMPT in ASM cells. Therefore, we tested the effects
of resveratrol on NAD+ plus NADH levels in ASM cells
(Fig. S2). ASM cells treated with 50 µM resveratrol for
3, 6, and 24 h increased intracellular NAD+ plus NADH
levels significantly, with a peak at the 6 h treatment time
point. At the 1 h treatment time point, resveratrol did not
show obvious effects on NAD+ plus NADH levels in ASM
cells (Fig. S2).

Resveratrol-induced Tert, Nampt, Sirt4, and
telomerase activity in mice

Resveratrol regulates members of the SIRT family
in ASM cells

To validate our findings further, we assayed protein
expression and telomerase activity in mice treated with
resveratrol. Male mice (11-12 weeks old, n=6) were
randomly assigned to either the resveratrol treated group
(n=3) or the DMSO treated control group (n=3). Mouse
heart lysates were used for both Western blot analyses
and telomerase activity assays (Fig. 6). In line with our in
vitro results, Western blotting showed that expression of
Tert, Nampt and Sirt4 were greatly induced in the hearts
of mice treated with resveratrol (Fig. 6A). Compared
with the control group, Tert, Nampt, and Sirt4 levels
increased 4.3±0.4, 3.1±0.6, and 2.5±0.8 fold, respectively,
in resveratrol treated mice compared to DMSO treated
mice (Fig. 6B). Telomerase activity was also increased
in heart tissue from resveratrol treated mice compared
to DMSO vehicle treated control mice (Fig. 6C). In 3
control mice, we observed 4 weak TRAP product bands
in each sample, while in resveratrol treated mice, all of
the TRAP product bands were brighter and more dense,
which suggested higher telomerase activity in the hearts
of resveratrol treated mice (Fig. 6C). The mean levels
of telomerase activity in resveratrol treated mice were
4.3±0.8 fold higher than the activity in hearts isolated from

Since NAMPT is known to regulate the SIRT
family of NAD dependent deacetylase genes [11, 13],
we investigated further whether resveratrol regulates
SIRT1-7 in ASM cells as a possible link between NAMPT
and hTERT. Specific primers for SIRT1 through SIRT7,
spanning at least one intron, were designed as shown in
Table 1, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed in
resveratrol treated ASM cells. Our data show that after 3 h
of exposure to resveratrol (50µM), mRNA levels of SIRT1,
SIRT3, and SIRT4, were upregulated while SIRT6 was
down-regulated (Fig. 5A). Expression of SIRT 2, 5 and
7 seemed unaffected by this dose of resveratrol. Among
these upregulated SIRT genes, SIRT4 was the most highly
expressed following resveratrol treatment. SIRT4 mRNA
levels were elevated 1.9±0.1 and 2.4±0.1 fold compared
to the DMSO treated controls at 3 h, and 6 h, respectively
(Fig. 5B). These observations were validated further by
TaqMan qRT-PCR analyses (Fig. S1D). SIRT3 expression
was increased by 1.4±0.1 and 1.5±0.1 fold compared to the
DMSO control after 3 and 6 hours, respectively (Fig. 5B).

DMSO treated control mice, as evaluated by measuring
pixel density within bands above 50 bp (Fig. 6D).
Telomerase activity assays and Western blotting
were also performed on liver tissue isolated from
C57BL/6J female mice of different ages. Telomerase
activity decreased with age in resveratrol untreated mice
(Fig. S3A). Using 0.04 µg protein for the assay, we clearly
observed more TRAP bands in 6-week aged mouse liver
than 11-week aged mouse liver, and more TRAP bands
were observed in 11-week aged mouse liver than 27
week-aged mouse liver (Fig. S3A). In the 27-week aged
mouse, we detected stronger TRAP bands in resveratrol
treated mouse than untreated two mice (Fig. S3B).
Because in 11-week aged mice, the telomerase activities
were too high that most of bands appeared between 36
bp internal control and 50 bp bands in resveratrol treated
mice (data not shown). In order to clearly show the effects
of resveratrol, we then diluted the lysate 10 times in this
group of miceand performed the telomerase activity
assays again. Our data showed that resveratrol induced a
noticeable increase in telomerase activity in 11-week aged
mice (Fig. S3C). Both the number and the pixel density
of TRAP bands above 50 bp were increased in resveratrol
treated mice than untreated mouse (Fig. S3C). Western
blot analysis of liver lysates further strengthened our
findings (Fig.S3D). Tert expression decreased with age in
untreated mouse liver. Resveratrol induced Tert expression
in both mice at age of 11-weeks. In 27-week aged mice,
resveratrol failed to induce an increase in Tert expression
as significantly as in the 11-week aged mice, which is in
line with our results from the telomerase activity assay
(Fig. S3B and C). Furthermore, resveratrol induced both
Nampt and Sirt4 in the 27-week and 11-week aged mice
(Fig. S3D).
Our data strongly suggests that resveratrol induced
telomerase activity, along with Tert, Nampt, and Sirt4
expression in vivo.

cardiovascular diseases, have become increasingly
appreciated in recent years [14]. There are numerous
known targets of resveratrol linked to its cardioprotective
activity, as previously reviewed [15], however, the details
about many of these signal transduction mechanisms
involved in these processes remain to be elucidated fully.
In this study we demonstrate that resveratrol activates
the human TERT gene, which is generally considered to
be a longevity gene in mammalian cells. We established
further that this activation is dependent upon enhanced
NAMPT and SIRT4 expression. These findings implicate a
NAMPT-SIRT4-hTERT axis as a fundamental determinant
of resveratrol action in human aortic smooth muscle cells.
Both cardiovascular risk factors and common
cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, heart
failure, and hypertension, are associated with short
leukocyte telomeres [16]. In our study system, resveratrol
greatly increased activation of hTERT in ASM cells.
Resveratrol also induced higher telomerase activity in

ASM and HMVEC-L cells, relative to the induction in
A549 cells, which already had high levels of telomerase
activity (Fig. 1G, 1H, and 1I). In conjunction with previous
studies that resveratrol activates hTERT in endothelial
progenitor cells [17], but down-regulates hTERT in breast
cancer cells [18], our findings may suggest resveratrol
acts differently in normal cells compared to cancer cells.
Further studies are needed to determine the validity of this
idea.
We utilized the sensitive TRAP-eze assay system
to detect telomerase activity in lysates isolated from
resveratrol treated cells. We showed that 50µM of
resveratrol increased TRAP products significantly,
especially at the 6 h treatment time point not only in
ASM cells, but also in A549 cells and HMVEC cells
(Fig.1G, 1H, 1I), strongly suggesting resveratrol increases
telomerase activity in ASM, A549, and HMVEC cells.
These data support the idea that resveratrol induction of
hTERT results in increased telomerase activity.
The role of NAMPT as a driver of cellular stress
resistance and longevity is noteworthy in the context
of its expression profile. NAMPT is upregulated by
stressful stimuli including infection and pro-inflammatory
cytokines [19-21]. Recent studies also identify NAMPT
as underlying an aging suppression pathway in smooth
muscle cells, with potential relevance to controlling
atherosclerosis and possibly other diseases of aging [22].
In this study, we first report that resveratrol increases
both NAMPT mRNA and protein (Fig. 2) in ASM
cells. Furthermore, we found that treatment with 50 µM
resveratrol for 6 hours also increased intracellular NAD+
plus NADH levels significantly in ASM cells, presumably
via the upregulation of NAMPT, which is a key enzyme in
NAD synthesis (Fig. S2).
The NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin
(SIRT) family of proteins promotes cell survival, stress

resistance, and longevity as reviewed by Guarente [23].
The majority of our knowledge of the SIRT family
pertains to SIRT1, though the functions for the other SIRT
genes, SIRT2–7, in mammalian physiology have recently
emerged. Decreased expression of SIRT1 is associated
with endothelial dysfunction in arteries from aged mice
and humans [24]. It is generally accepted that resveratrol is
a SIRT1 activator [12]. In this study, we explored SIRT1-7
using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and our results showed
resveratrol up-regulates SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT4, and downregulates SIRT6 in ASM cells (Fig.5A and B). Of these
four genes, SIRT4 was the most highly upregulated. In
accordance with these results, protein levels of SIRT4
and SIRT1 in resveratrol treated ASM cells were also
enhanced (Fig. 5C and D). The induction of both SIRT4
and SIRT1 were validated further by qRT-PCR (Fig. S1D
and C). We then investigated if NAMPT, and SIRT4 were
required for resveratrol-induced hTERT. Transfection of
ASM cells with siRNA specific for NAMPT and SIRT4
reduced expression by 90% and 80%, respectively. In both
instances when NAMPT or SIRT4 were knocked down,
resveratrol induction of hTERT was blocked (Fig. 3A and
B; Fig. 5G and H), suggesting NAMPT and SIRT4 are
necessary for resveratrol induction of hTERT. Meanwhile
knockdown of SIRT4 did not block resveratrol induction
of NAMPT (Fig.5G), suggesting that NAMPT functions
upstream of SIRT4. We also explored the role of SIRT1
in this process, but we did not observe the significant
difference in hTERT induction between ASM cell and
SIRT1 knocking down ASM cells (data not shown).
Our results is in line with the other group showing that
NAMPT-mediated cell protection from stress–induced cell
death requires SIRT3 and SIRT4, not SIRT1 [11].
To strengthen our findings that NAMPT plays a
pivotal role in resveratrol-induced hTERT and telomerase
activity, we transfected A549 cells with pCAGGS10821

dangerous because the resulting proinflammatory
and non-reparative condition can induce both lesion
disruption and acute vascular occlusion. Our findings
show that resveratrol could activate human telomerase
via a NAMPT and SIRT4 dependent pathway. Thus, we
propose a NAMPT-SIRT4-hTERT axis, as illustrated in
Fig. S4, which may represent a novel signal transduction
mechanism for the anti-aging effects of resveratrol in
human ASM cells enriching our understanding for how
resveratrol contributes to positive outcomes in human
cardiovascular diseases. Our validated observations in
resveratrol treated mouse heart tissues, HMVEC-L cells,
and A549 cells suggest that “NAMPT-SIRT4-hTERT
axis” may be a generalized mechanism underlying the
reseveratrol’s beneficial role in human physiology.

NAMPT (NAMPTOE) and pCAGGS-NAMPT-H247E
(H247EOE). pCAGGS-H247E is a mutated form of
NAMPT and its overexpression does not have enzymatic
activity. In our system, although A549 cells transfected
with H247E expressed more NAMPT protein than the
pCAGGS-NAMPT transfected cells (Fig. 4A). The
telomerase activity was not increased by resveratrol as
high as in the cells transfected with NAMPT (Fig.4B and
C), suggesting that NAMPT enzymatic activity is crucial
in resveratrol-induced hTERT expression and telomerase
activity.
We observed that the baseline of hTERT expression
and telomerase activity were increased slightly by siRNANAMPT (Fig.3A and B), which may be due to the side
effects of the transfection reagents. To understand fully
the effect of resveratrol-induced telomerase activity,
we performed animal experiments in our study. As a
preliminary experiment, we treated a few mice at different
age groups. After treating the mice with resveratrol (30
mg/kg) or the same volume of DMSO (vehicle control)
for ten days, we performed telomerase activity assays
and Western blot analyses on mice livers. The telomerase
activities in untreated mice livers were shown to decrease
with age, suggesting the high reliability and efficiency
of our experimental system (Fig. S3A). Although we did
not examine a large sample size in every age group, our
findings suggested that resveratrol induced telomerase
activity and Tert expression are related with age. Increased
telomerase activity induced by resveratrol was detected
more obviously in 11-week old mice compared to the 27week old mice both for telomerase activity assays and for
Western blot analysis (Fig. S3). Thus, we then used 1112 weeks of aged male C57 BL/6J mice and performed
telomerase activity assays and Western blot analyses on
heart tissues, as the benefit of resveratrol on cardiovascular
system is the major goal of our study. Our in vivo data
strongly strengthened our in vitro findings (Fig. 6). We
observed weaker bands in untreated three mice, and after
treatment with resveratrol, the telomerase activities were
elevated in all 3 mice hearts as the TRAP product bands
are all much denser and brighter (Fig. 6 C and D). Western
blot analyses also showed that resveratrol induced Tert,
Nampt, and Sirt4 protein expression in the hearts of
resveratrol treated mice (Fig. 6A and B).
Moving forward we hope to elucidate further the
connection between additional SIRT family members
and the described resveratrol pathway. Natural targets
of investigation include overexpression of NAMPT and
SIRT4 in vitro. It would also be interesting to investigate
whether SIRT1 plays a role in this pathway even though it
was not as highly affected by resveratrol as SIRT4.
Cell senescence, as well as the decline of tissue
regenerative potential, are strongly implicated in agerelated pathologies as previously reviewed [25]. In
addition, vascular smooth muscle cell senescence, a key
feature of atherosclerotic lesions [26], can be especially
