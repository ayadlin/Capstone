Abstract
1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an important industrial and environmental chemical classified as a human carcinogen based on
epidemiologic studies in occupationally exposed workers and
animal studies in laboratory rats and mice. BD is metabolically activated to three epoxides that can react with
nucleophilic sites in biomolecules. Among these, 1,2,3,4diepoxybutane (DEB) is considered the ultimate carcinogen
due to its high genotoxicity and mutagenicity attributed to its
ability to form DNA-DNA cross-links. Our laboratory has
developed quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography–MESI+–tandem mass spectrometry methods for two
DEB-specific DNA-DNA cross-links, 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3butanediol (bis-N7G-BD) and 1-(guan-7-yl)-4-(aden-1-yl)-2,3butanediol (N7G-N1A-BD). This report describes molecular
dosimetry analysis of these adducts in tissues of B6C3F1 mice
and F344 rats exposed to a range of BD concentrations (0–625
ppm). Much higher (4- to 10-fold) levels of DEB-DNA crosslinks were observed in mice compared with rats exposed to
the same BD concentrations. In both species, bis-N7G-BD
levels were 1.5- to 4-fold higher in the liver than in other
tissues examined. Interestingly, tissues of female animals
exposed to BD contained higher concentrations of bis-N7G-BD
adducts than tissues of male animals, which is in accord with
previously reported differences in tumor incidence. The
molecular dosimetry data presented herein suggest that
species and gender differences observed in BD-induced cancer
are directly related to differences in the extent of BD
metabolism to DEB. Furthermore, a rat model of sensitivity
to BD may be more appropriate than a mouse model for
assessing human risk associated with BD exposure, because
rats and humans seem to be similar with respect to DEB
formation. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2479–86]

Introduction
1,3-Butadiene (BD) is a high-volume industrial chemical used
in the production of plastics and rubber (1). It is also an
environmental toxin present in automobile exhaust and in cigarette
smoke (2, 3). BD is classified as a human carcinogen based on
laboratory animal data linking it to the formation of tumors;

human epidemiology data revealing increased incidence of
leukemia and lymphohematopoietic cancers in occupationally
exposed workers; and genotoxicity data for laboratory animals
demonstrating the induction of point mutations, large deletions,
and chromosomal aberrations following exposure to BD (4–8). Due
to the ubiquitous human exposures to BD, there is a pressing need
to identify biomarkers of BD exposure for use in quantitative risk
assessment. In particular, specific biomarkers of the metabolic
activation of BD to DNA-reactive intermediates are required.
BD is metabolized by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases to
generate three reactive epoxides, e.g., 3,4-epoxybutene, 3,4-epoxy1,2-butanediol, and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB; Fig. 1; refs. 9–11).
Although all three epoxide metabolites can react with DNA, DEB is
considered the ultimate carcinogenic form of BD because of its
potent genotoxicity and its ability to form bifunctional DNA
adducts such as DNA-DNA cross-links and exocyclic DNA lesions
(12–14). Studies in human cell culture reveal that DEB is 100- to
200-fold more mutagenic than BD-derived epoxides that possess a
single epoxide functionality (15). DEB preferentially alkylates the
N7 position of guanine bases in DNA to form N7-(2¶-hydroxy-3¶,
4¶-epoxybut-1¶-yl)-guanine (N7-HEB-dG) adducts (16). The epoxide
group of N7-HEB-dG can then be hydrolyzed to N7-(2¶,3¶,4¶trihydroxybut-1¶-yl)-guanine (THBG), or, less frequently, can react
with another site in DNA, such as the N7 of another guanine or
the N1 of an adenine (13, 17). The latter reaction forms 1,4-bis(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol (bis-N7G-BD) and 1-(guan-7-yl)-4-(aden1-yl)-2,3-butanediol (N7G-N1A-BD) cross-links (Fig. 1; refs. 13, 17).
Alkali-catalyzed Dimroth rearrangement of N7G-N1A-BD leads to
the corresponding N7G-N6A-BD adducts (Fig. 1; ref. 18).
Chronic BD inhalation studies in mice and rats revealed that it
was carcinogenic in both species, but with a striking difference in
sensitivity and tissue specificity. Mice developed tumors following
exposure to as low as 6.25 ppm BD (8), whereas in rats, tumors
were not observed until the exposure reached 1,000 ppm BD (19).
Furthermore, the target tissues for BD-induced cancer in mice
(lung, heart, hematopoietic system) were different from those in
rats (thyroid, pancreas, testis, uterus; refs. 8, 19). The increased
susceptibility of mice to the carcinogenicity of BD may result from
a more efficient metabolic activation of BD to DEB in this species
(20–22). Indeed, several studies have found that target tissues of
BD-exposed mice, especially lung, contain significant levels of DEB
(23). DEB-specific N,N-(2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-butanediyl)-valine (pyrVal) globin adducts were detected in mice treated with as little as 3
ppm BD by inhalation (24). In contrast, the formation of DEB in rat
tissues is negligible, providing a possible explanation for the weak
tumorigenic response to BD in this species (22–25). Consistent with
this model, rat, mouse, and human cells are equally sensitive to the
genotoxic effects of DEB when it is introduced directly into isolated

lymphocytes (26, 27). However, the formation of DEB-specific DNADNA adducts in tissues of laboratory mice and rats exposed to BD
has not been previously investigated.
Earlier studies analyzed DEB monoadducts in rodent tissues in
an attempt to explain the observed interspecies differences in
carcinogenic response. Koc and colleagues examined the formation
of THBG adducts (Fig. 1) in the liver DNA of B6C3F1 mice and F344
rats treated with 20 to 625 ppm of BD for 4 weeks (28). THBG levels
were only 2-fold higher in mice than in rats (28) and thus are
unlikely to account for the 1,000-fold greater sensitivity of mice to
BD-mediated cancer. The study concluded that >95% of the THBG
adducts were formed not from DEB but from another, more
prevalent metabolite of BD, 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (Fig. 1; ref. 28).
These results emphasized the need for a unique biomarker for DEB
to use in predicting the carcinogenic risk of BD (28, 29).
We have recently developed a quantitative high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methodology for two types of
DEB-specific DNA-DNA cross-links, 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol (bis-N7G-BD) and 1-(guan-7-yl)-4-(aden-1-yl)-2,3-butanediol
(N7G-N1A-BD; refs. 18, 30). In our approach, the cross-linked
nucleobases are released from the DNA backbone by neutral
thermal or mild acid hydrolysis, enriched by ultrafiltration and

HPLC or solid phase extraction, and analyzed by capillary HPLCESI-MS/MS using the corresponding 15N-labeled adducts as
internal standards (18, 30). The N7G-N1A-BD adducts are
converted to the corresponding 1-(guan-7-yl)-4-(aden-6-yl)-2,3butanediol (N7G-N6A-BD) lesions via forced Dimroth rearrangement before analysis to improve the sensitivity of the method and
to eliminate adduct decomposition during sample processing (18).
We found that liver DNA of female C57BL/6 and B6C3F1 mice
exposed to 625 ppm BD by inhalation contained bis-N7G-BD
adducts in 10-fold greater amounts than N7G-N1A-BD (18, 30).
However, unlike bis-N7G-BD cross-links that are hydrolytically
labile and are spontaneously released from DNA by depurination
(t 1/2, 81.5 hours), N7G-N1A-BD lesions may persist in DNA and
accumulate in tissues over time (13, 18).
The objective of the present work was to quantify DEB-induced
DNA-DNA cross-links in tissues of laboratory rats and mice
exposed to BD by inhalation in an attempt to establish the
structural basis of species differences in sensitivity to BD-mediated
carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. We obtained dose-response
relationships for DEB-induced DNA-DNA cross-links in tissues of
B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats exposed to increasing concentrations
of BD (6.25, 62.5, 200, and 625 ppm for 2 weeks). Unlike previous
results for THBG adducts (28), the amounts of DEB-specific

bifunctional DNA adducts exhibited important interspecies and
gender differences that correlate with previously observed differences in tumorigenic susceptibility, supporting the idea that DEB
plays an important role in BD-mediated cancer in mice.

Materials and Methods
Note: DEB is a known carcinogen and must be handled with adequate
safety precautions.
Materials and methods. All chemicals and solvents were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, unless stated otherwise. Racemic and meso bis-N7G-BD,
[15N10]-bis-N7G-BD N7G-N1A-BD, and [15N3,13C1]-N7G-N1A-BD were prepared in our laboratory as described elsewhere (18, 31).
Animals and treatment. Animals (B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats) were
randomly separated into air-control and exposure groups by weight and
were housed individually in hanging wire stainless-steel cages according to
NIH guidelines (NIH Publication 86-23; 1985). All procedures involving the
use of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Experimental animals were exposed using multitiered wholebody exposure chambers (H-2000, Laboratory Products). Rodents in one
chamber received filtered air only as a control group, and rodents in the
other chamber received nominal 6.25, 62.5, 200, or 625 ppm BD for 2 wk
(6 h/d, 5 d/wk). Animals were housed within exposure chambers
throughout the experiment and had free access to food and water except
for removal of food during the 6-h exposure periods. Within 2 h after
cessation of the final day of exposure, animals were euthanized via cardiac
puncture, and tissues were harvested and snap-frozen for storage at 80jC.
Tissues were shipped on dry ice to the University of Minnesota where they
were stored at 80jC until DNA extraction.
DNA isolation. DNA was isolated using NucleoBond AXG500 anion
exchange cartridges (Macherey-Nagel) according to manufacturer’s procedures. In brief, tissues (0.1–0.4 g) were homogenized and incubated with
RNase and proteinase K at 50jC for 2 to 4 h. Samples were loaded on
NucleoBond AXG cartridges, which were prepared and washed following
the kit instructions. Following elution, DNA was precipitated by the
addition of isopropanol. The DNA was spooled, washed thrice with cold
70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in Milli-Q water (500 AL). DNA purity and
amounts were determined by UV spectrophotometry. Typical A 260/A 280
ratios were between 1.7 and 1.9, ensuring minimal protein contamination.
Bis-N7G-BD sample preparation. DNA (100 Ag) was dissolved in
200 AL of water, added to racemic and meso 15N10-bis-N7G-BD internal
standards (300 fmol each), and heated at 70jC for 1 h to release
N7-alkylguanine adducts. Following thermal hydrolysis, the partially
depurinated DNA backbone was removed by ultrafiltration with Centricon
YM-10 filters (Millipore Corp.). The filtrates containing bis-N7G-BD were
further purified by offline HPLC as described below, whereas partially
depurinated DNA was recovered for future analysis of N7G-N1A-BD (see
below; ref. 18). Offline HPLC purification of bis-N7G-BD was performed
using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.6  150 mm, 5 Am) column. Bis-N7G-BD
was eluted with a gradient consisting of 0.4% formic acid in H2O (A) and
acetonitrile (B). The column was maintained at 0% B for 5 min, followed by
a linear increase to 3% B in 10 min, and then further to 40% B over 5 min.
The system was equilibrated for 15 min between runs. The retention time of
bis-N7G-BD (12.4 min) was determined with 15N10-labeled internal standard
to prevent carryover contamination. Samples were added to 2¶-deoxythymidine (retention time 9.8 min) and 2¶-deoxyadenosine (retention time 16.6
min; 0.5 Ag each) as HPLC retention time markers. HPLC fractions
containing bis-N7G-BD were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in
0.05% acetic acid (25 AL) before liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS
analysis.
N7G-N1A-BD sample preparation. Partially depurinated DNA backbone recovered from neutral thermal hydrolysis was added to 13C1,15N3N7G-N1A-BD (300 fmol, internal standard for mass spectrometry) and
hydrolyzed in the presence of 0.1 mol/L HCl to release all purine bases,
including N7G-N1A-BD. The hydrolysates were filtered by YM-10 filters and
purified by solid-phase extraction on C18 cartridges as previously reported

www.aacrjournals.org

(18). Samples were heated in base (1.0 mol/L NH4OH at 70jC for 16 h) to
force Dimroth rearrangement of N7G-N1A-BD to N7G-N6A-BD (18). The
ammonium hydroxide was removed under vacuum, and samples were
dissolved in 0.05% acetic acid (25 AL) before LC-MS/MS analysis.
HPLC-MESI+-MS/MS. MS instrumentation and chromatographic separation of bis-N7G-BD was achieved using previously published methods
(30), with minor changes to HPLC conditions to improve sensitivity. Our
optimized method uses 0.05% acetic acid (A) and methanol (B) as HPLC
solvents. A Zorbax Extend C18 column (3.5 Am, 150  0.5 mm) was eluted
with a gradient of 0% to 10% B in 5 min, further from 10% to 60% over
10 min, and ramped back to 0% B over 3 min. The HPLC flow rate was
10 AL/min, the column temperature was maintained at 40jC, and the
injection volume was typically 8 AL. With this solvent system, the retention
time of racemic bis-N7G-BD was 9.9 min, whereas meso bis-N7G-BD eluted
at 10.9 min.
Liquid chromatography-nanoESI-MS/MS analysis of N7G-N6A-BD.
A Waters nanoAquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system
(Waters Corp.) interfaced to a Thermo-Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp.) was used for these analyses.
HPLC solvents were 0.01% acetic acid in water (A) and 1:1 LC-MS grade
methanol/acetonitrile (B). Samples (4–8 AL) were loaded on a trapping
column (Symmetry C18 nanoAcquity 0.18  20 mm) for 1 min at 0% B.
Chromatographic separation was achieved using an Atlantis C18 (75  100
Am, Waters) column eluted at a flow rate of 0.350 AL/min. A linear gradient
program was used as follows: from 0% to 12% B in 2 min, further to 25% B
over 7 min, and finally to 45% B over 15 min. The column was equilibrated
at 0% B for at least 12 min before each run. Under these conditions, both
racemic and meso N7G-N6A-BD eluted at 16.9 min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in the selected reaction monitoring mode by the following
mass transitions corresponding to the neutral loss of guanine from
protonated molecules of the adduct: m/z 373.1 ! m/z 222.1 [M + H - Gua]+
(N7G-N6A-BD) and m/z 377.1 ! m/z 222.1 [M + H - [13C1,15N3]Gua]+
(13C1,15N3-N7G-N6A-BD) (18).
N7G-N1A-BD method validation. Three replicates of control mouse
liver DNA (partially depurinated and collected from YM-10 filters) were
added to N7G-N1A-BD (1 fmol) and internal standard (300 fmol). The
validation samples were processed (by acid hydrolysis, filtration, SPE, and
forced Dimroth rearrangement) following the same methods as real
samples. The validation samples were each analyzed on three separate
days to determine accuracy and precision of the methods.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet analysis tools. A Student’s t test (two samples assuming
unequal variances) was used to determine the P values for female/male
differences in adduct levels.

Results
Optimization and Validation of HPLC-MS/MS
Methods
The capillary HPLC-ESI+-MS/MS methods for bis-N7G-BD and
N7G-N1A-BD previously developed in our laboratory (18, 30) were
not sensitive enough to quantify DEB-specific DNA-DNA crosslinks in tissues of laboratory mice and rats exposed to low
concentrations of BD. Therefore, both methods were further
optimized to improve sensitivity and reproducibility. The assay
for bis-N7G-BD was optimized by incorporating an off-line HPLC
clean-up step instead of solid-phase extraction. In addition, the
solvent system for capillary HPLC-ESI+-MS/MS analysis was
changed from ammonium acetate buffer/ACN to water/methanol.
With these modifications, the limit of quantitation was improved
from 10 fmol/100 Ag DNA to 2 fmol/100 Ag mouse liver DNA (or 6
bis-N7G-BD/109 nts). The quantitative methods for N7G-N1A-BD
were optimized by incorporating nanospray HPLC-ESI+-MS/MS,
leading to an improved limit of quantitation from 5 fmol/100 Ag
DNA to 1 fmol/100 Ag DNA (or 3 N7G-N1A-BD/109 nts). The

optimized methods were validated by analyzing control DNA
samples added to known amounts of analyte and internal standard.
Intraday accuracy and a precision of 91 F 14% were observed for 1
fmol N7G-N1A-BD added to control mouse liver DNA ( full
validation data and representative nanospray-MS/MS chromatogram can be found in Supplemental Information S1 and S2).
Because all three stereoisomers of DEB are formed metabolically
(R,R; S,S; and meso DEB; ref. 11), three stereoisomers of the DEBDNA cross-links can potentially be formed (Fig. 1). Our current
methods analyze R,R and S,S bis-N7G-BD isomers as a racemic
mixture separate from meso bis-N7G-BD. N7G-N1A-BD adducts are
converted to the corresponding N7G-N6A-BD adducts by forced
Dimroth rearrangement (Fig. 1), because our previous studies
showed that this results in a greater sensitivity for in vivo sample
analyses (18). Based on our in vitro studies, N7G-N1A-BD is the
most abundant Gua-Ade cross-link of DEB, whereas little N7G-N6ABD is formed at concentrations below 500 Amol/L DEB (17, 18).
Therefore, the majority of N7G-N6A-BD adducts being measured by
our methods represent N7G-N1A-BD lesions formed in vivo.

Dose-response Curves
The optimized HPLC-ESI+-MS/MS methods described above
were used to quantify bis-N7G-BD and N7G-N1A-BD/N7G-N6A-BD
cross-links in liver DNA of B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats exposed to a
range of BD concentrations (0–625 ppm) by inhalation for 10 days
(Figs. 2 and 3). We found that S,S + R,R (racemic) bis-N7G-BD was
the most abundant DNA cross-link formed upon exposure to BD in
both species, followed by meso bis-N7G-BD and N7G-N1A-BD/N7GN6A-BD. The molar ratio of G-G and G-A DEB cross-links observed
in the current work (f10:1) is consistent with a lower reactivity of
adenine nucleobases toward epoxide electrophiles (32) and is
similar to the molar ratios of N 7-(2¶,3¶,4¶-trihydroxybut-1¶-yl)guanine
(N7-THBG) and N 6-(2¶,3¶,4¶-trihydroxybut-1¶-yl)adenine (N6-THBA)
monoadducts reported previously (33, 34).

Significant interspecies differences were observed between DEBDNA adduct levels in mouse and rat DNA (Fig. 2). Concentrations
of racemic bis-N7G-BD were 4- to 10-fold higher in mice than in
rats at all exposure levels. Whereas the shape of the bis-N7G-BD
dose-response curve for mice appears curvilinear, bending
downward slightly between 200 and 625 ppm BD, rat adduct levels
reached a plateau at 62.5 ppm, suggesting that the metabolic
activation of 3,4-epoxybutene to DEB is saturated in this species
(Fig. 2). The only DEB-DNA cross-link observed at the lowest BD
exposure (6.25 ppm) in mice was S,S+R,R bis-N7G-BD (0.32 F 0.09
adducts/107 nts). The lowest exposure at which measurable levels
of bis-N7G-BD were observed in rats was 62.5 ppm, although we
did not have access to tissues of animals exposed to BD amounts
between 6.25 and 62.5 ppm.
A similar trend was observed for N7G-N1A-BD/N7G-N6A-BD,
which was significantly more abundant in liver DNA of mice
compared with the corresponding rat tissue (Fig. 3). The doseresponse curve for N7G-N1A-BD/N7G-N6A-BD is much steeper in
the mouse than in the rat, which exhibits signs of metabolic
saturation at exposures above 62.5 ppm BD (Fig. 3). These results
are fully consistent with the data for bis-N7G-BD (Fig. 2).
Tissue distribution of bis-N7G-BD. To analyze the tissue
distribution of DEB-DNA adducts following exposure of laboratory
mice and rats to BD by inhalation, bis-N7G-BD adduct levels were
determined in liver, lung, kidney, brain, and thymus tissues. In both
species, bis-N7G-BD levels were highest in the liver (Table 1). For
BD-exposed mice, liver adduct levels (3.95 S,S + R,R bis-N7G-BD/
107 nts) were 3–10-fold higher than in the other tissues (0.38–1.35
S,S + R,R bis-N7G-BD/107 nts; Table 1). In BD-exposed rats, liver
adduct levels (0.36 S,S + R,R bis-N7G-BD/107 nts) were f1.5-fold
higher than in the other tissues (0.21–0.30 S,S + R,R bis-N7G-BD/107
nts; Table 1).
Gender differences in DEB-DNA adduct formation. Female
mice develop tumors at lower BD exposure than males, indicating

gender differences in susceptibility (15). It has been previously
reported that when exposed to 62.5 ppm BD for 6 hours, the
concentration of DEB in the blood of female rats is 6-fold greater
than in males (22). Similarly, the formation of DEB-specific globin
adducts [N,N-(2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-butanediyl)-valine, pyr-Val] is 2- to
4-fold higher in female than in male rats exposed to 1,000 ppm BD
(24). Therefore, we investigated potential gender differences in the
formation of bis-N7G-BD adducts in the liver DNA of female and
male mice and rats exposed to 625 ppm BD (Fig. 4). We found that
in both species, the amounts of S,S, R,R bis-N7G-BD were 2- to 2.5fold higher in female animals compared with males subjected to
the same exposure conditions. Furthermore, the amounts of meso
bis-N7G-BD adducts were 3-fold higher in female mouse liver DNA
than the corresponding amounts in male mouse liver DNA (data
not shown). Tissues were not available for full dose response
analyses in male animals; however, similar gender differences were
observed in animals exposed to 200 ppm BD (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Although BD is a known mutagen and carcinogen present
ubiquitously in urban air, the exact mechanisms of its mutagenic
and carcinogenic activity remain to be established. Furthermore,
human BD exposure risk assessment is complicated by large
interspecies differences in sensitivity to BD-induced cancer. BD is a
potent carcinogen in mice, but is only a weak carcinogen in rats.
B6C3F1 mice develop tumors at BD exposure concentrations three
orders of magnitude lower than those that cause cancer in
Sprague-Dawley rats (19, 22, 23). It has been proposed that the
carcinogenic potency of BD in a given organism can be predicted
from the relative amount of the diepoxide metabolite, DEB,
generated upon metabolic activation (27, 29). However, in vivo
formation and repair of bifunctional DEB-DNA adducts in
laboratory rats and mice exposed to BD have not been previously
investigated.
We have developed sensitive and specific HPLC-ESI-MS/MS
methods, which, for the first time, quantify the formation of DEB-

Our results for dose-dependent formation of bis-N7G-BD and N7GN1A-BD/N7G-N6A-BD in tissues of laboratory mice and rats
exposed to 0 to 625 ppm BD by inhalation (Figs. 2 and 3) reveal
remarkable interspecies differences between adduct levels. For
example, the concentrations of bis-N7G-BD adducts in mouse liver
following 10-day exposure to 625 ppm BD were 10-fold greater than
in rats exposed at the same conditions (Fig. 2). Both bis-N7G-BD
and N7G-N1A-BD/N7G-N6A-BD reach a plateau in rat after
inhalation exposures above 62.5 ppm, possibly a result of enzymatic
saturation, P450 2E1 inactivation through phosphorylation (35), or
suicide inhibition of the protein by covalent binding of epoxide
products to the active site (36). These results are consistent with a
greater sensitivity of laboratory mice to BD-mediated carcinogenesis (8, 19), suggesting that DEB-induced bifunctional DNA lesions
play an important role in BD-mediated cancer.
Our results are in accord with previously published dose
response data for DEB-specific hemoglobin adducts (pyr-Val),
which revealed that DEB adduct levels in mice were 4 to 10 times
greater than levels in rats exposed to the same conditions (37). The
dose-response curves for both DEB-induced hemoglobin adducts
(37) and DNA-DNA cross-links (Figs. 2 and 3) in the rat are
supralinear, providing evidence for the saturation of metabolic

activation pathways in this species following exposure to 62.5 ppm
BD (38). In contrast, the dose-response curves for the formation of
DEB-specific DNA adducts in the mouse are curvilinear between
6.25 and 625 ppm BD and do not show any signs of metabolic
saturation (Figs. 2 and 3).
Taken together, these results suggest that the interspecies
differences in the carcinogenic potency of BD in rats and mice
are related to metabolic differences (11). Mice form 5-fold more
DEB than rats per unit of BD exposure (39), which is reflected in a
higher efficiency for the formation of DEB-globin adducts (37) and
DEB-DNA adducts in this species (Table 2). As shown in Table 2,
the number of bis-N7G-BD adducts per BD exposure level in mice
is greatest following a low BD exposure, but exceeds the efficiency
of DEB-mediated DNA cross-linking in the rat at all BD exposures
examined.
In addition to significant differences in sensitivity to BD
carcinogenesis, rats and mice also differ in tissue specificity of
BD-mediated tumor formation. In long-term inhalation studies,
mice developed tumors of the lung, lymphatic system, liver,
forestomach, and heart, whereas rats exhibited tumors in different
tissues, including pancreas, testis, mammary gland, and thyroid
gland (7). Our results presented in Table 1 indicate that these
differences are not a result of tissue-dependent generation/
accumulation of DEB. In both species, DEB-DNA adduct levels
were highest in the liver (Table 1), consistent with the high activity
of cytochrome P450 enzymes that activate BD to DEB in this tissue.
Bis-N7G-BD concentrations in extrahepatic tissues (lung, kidney,
brain, and thymus) were 1.5-3-fold lower than those in liver DNA,
but similar to one another. These results are consistent with a
model in which DEB is formed primarily in the liver and is
transported throughout the body to reach other tissues (22).
Several recent studies suggested that there may be gender
differences in cancer susceptibility and BD metabolism in
laboratory animals. In carcinogenesis studies on BD, female mice
develop tumors at lower BD concentrations than males (15).
Furthermore, female rats contained higher blood DEB concentrations than male rats following a single 6-hour exposure to 62.5
ppm BD (22). Female rats also had 3- to 4-fold greater levels of pyrVal hemoglobin adducts than male rats following a 90-day exposure
to 1,000 ppm BD (24). Our results presented here are consistent
with these earlier findings. Bis-N7G-BD adduct amounts in female
rats and mice exposed to 625 ppm BD are 2- to 2.5-fold higher than
in males (Fig. 4). A similar trend is observed following lower BD
exposure (200 ppm; Fig. 4). In contrast, human epidemiology
studies comparing male and female industry workers exposed to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

BD observed no significant differences in gene mutations (e.g.,
HPRT mutant frequencies) or sister chromatid exchanges between
male and female workers (40, 41). Future studies of DNA and
protein adducts in occupationally exposed humans are needed to
determine whether gender differences in biomarker levels of BD
exposure and metabolism are observed in humans.
The possible roles of bis-N7G-BD and N7G-N1A-BD/N7G-N6ABD lesions investigated in the present work in the genotoxicity of
DEB remain to be established. Several laboratories, including our
group, have shown that bis-N7G-BD cross-links are formed
preferentially within the 5¶-GNC sequence context (31, 42, 43),
with nucleosome structure having little effect on sequence
selectivity of DEB-DNA cross-link formation (43). Interestingly,
whereas the S,S stereoisomer of DEB produces a greater number of
interstrand cross-links, all three DEB stereoisomers target 5¶-GNC
trinucleotides (44). Large local distortions of the DNA helix are
required to accommodate 1,3-interstrand bis-N7G-BD lesions
because the four-carbon tether length (6 Å) is much shorter than
the spacing between the distal N7-dG atoms in 5¶-GNC sequences
of canonical B-DNA (8.9 Å). In addition, meso DEB is capable of
inducing 1,2-intrastrand bis-N7G-BD lesions (31). Molecular
dynamics simulations predict that the base stacking and hydrogen
bonding interactions in the vicinity of 1,3-interstrand and 1,2intrastrand bis-N7G-BD cross-links are disrupted as a result of
twisting of the cross-linked residues with respect to the basepairing plane (31). The 3¶-exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli
polymerase I is blocked one nucleotide ahead of the interstrand
bis-N7G-BD lesions (31), consistent with an induced structural

change in the vicinity of the cross-link. These structural changes
may be important for the recognition of bis-N7G-BD adducts by
DNA repair enzymes.
Another factor that must be considered when evaluating
possible contributions of bis-N7G-BD and N7G-N1A-BD crosslinks to BD-mediated mutagenesis and cancer is differences in
their hydrolytic stability. All N7-alkylguanine adducts are hydrolytically labile because of the intrinsic destabilization of the
glycosidic bond when the N7 position of guanine is alkylated (45).
Both glycosidic bonds of bis-N7G-BD cross-links can be hydrolyzed, with a half-life in double-stranded DNA of 147 hours
(interstrand) and 35 hours (intrastrand; ref. 31). In contrast,
spontaneous depurination of the N7-guanine portion of N7G-N1A
and N7G-N6A DEB cross-links (Fig. 1) results in hydrolytically
stable adenine adducts containing a butanediol cross-link to free
guanine in one DNA strand and an abasic site in the other
(Supplement S3). If produced in vivo, semidepurinated interstrand
cross-links may be important to DEB mutagenesis because repair
synthesis on either strand must proceed past the damaged
nucleobase in the opposite strand.
In addition to interspecies differences in BD metabolism, the
concentrations of DEB-DNA adduct levels in tissues of rats and mice
can be affected by variations in DNA repair pathways. Experiments
examining the potential roles of nucleotide excision repair and base
excision repair pathways in the removal of bis-N7G-BD and N7GN1A-BD adducts are currently in progress in our laboratory.
In summary, our results presented herein provide additional
support to the hypothesis that DEB is the key metabolite largely
responsible for the interspecies differences in sensitivity to BD-

induced cancer (37, 39). Our study provides a greater molecular
detail of the consequences of interspecies metabolic differences by
quantifying DNA-DNA lesions specific for DEB. This work also has
implications for human risk assessment. Whereas the mouse model
is sometimes preferred because mice are the more sensitive species
to BD-induced cancer, studies in liver microsomes suggest that
mice form DEB at faster rates than both rats and humans (11). In
addition, human microsomes have higher epoxide hydrolase
activity than rats and mice and therefore hydrolyze DEB more
efficiently than both rat and mouse microsomes (11). Therefore, if
DEB is responsible for BD-induced cancer in the mouse, a rat
model of sensitivity may be more appropriate for setting limits of
human exposure.
