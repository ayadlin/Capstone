ABSTRACT
2-Dodecyl-6-methoxycyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione
(DMDD)
is
a
cyclohexanedione found in the roots of Averrhoa carambola L., commonly known as
starfruit. Researchers have shown that DMDD has significant therapeutic potential for
the treatment of diabetes; however, the effects of DMDD on human cancers have never
been reported. We investigated the cytotoxic effects of DMDD against human breast,
lung and bone cancer cells in vitro and further examined the molecular mechanisms of
DMDD-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. DMDD suppressed the growth
of breast carcinoma cells, but not normal mammary epithelial cells, via induction of
G1 phase cell cycle arrest, oxidative stress and apoptosis. DMDD increased the level
of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DMDD-induced ROS generation
was found to be associated with the mitochondrial activity. The cytotoxicity that was
induced by DMDD was attenuated by co-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylL-cysteine (NAC). DMDD-induced cell apoptosis involved the activation of both the
intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and the extrinsic receptor pathway. In addition,
DMDD inhibited the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway at all steps, including TNF-α
production, phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα, as well as TNF-α activated NF-κB
p65 nuclear translocation. Collectively, our studies indicate that DMDD has significant
potential as a safe and efficient therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

development of effective drugs with less adverse effects
for the chemopreventive intervention of cancers is the top
priority in cancer research.
Averrhoa carambola L. (Oxalidaceae) is a
perennial herb widely distributed in Southeast Asia.
Its roots have been employed in Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years as a remedy for
arthralgia and chronic paroxysmal headaches. Previously,
a cyclohexanedione, 2-Dodecyl-6-methoxycyclohexa2,5-diene-1,4-dione (DMDD) (Figure 1), was isolated

Human cancers are one of the leading causes of
death worldwide and breast cancers cause the highest
mortality in women amongst cancers. It is estimated that
232,670 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in
the US in 2014 and breast cancer represents 14.0% of
all new cancer cases in the U.S. [1]. Current therapeutic
treatments for cancer usually cause serious side effects,
such as bladder, kidney, lung or heart damage. Thus the

from the roots of Averrhoa carambola L. and found
to exhibit hypoglycemic and anti-lipid peroxidative
effects in diabetic mice [2, 3, 4]. Apart from their use as
pesticides as well as synthetic precursors to many organic
compounds, cyclohexanediones and their derivatives
have also attracted considerable attention because of their
broad range of biological properties such as antimicrobial,
antimalarial, and antitumor activities [5, 6, 7, 8]. However,
the effects of DMDD on human cancers have not yet been
investigated.
Because of recent studies linking diabetes and breast
cancer [9, 10, 11, 12] and the fact that the antidiabetic drug
metformin can effectively treat breast cancer [13, 14], we
decided to investigate whether DMDD could be used as
an antitumor agent against breast cancer. Tumor cells have
a myriad of aberrant physiological properties compared
to normal healthy cells and these differences have been
targeted in the development of anticancer agents. Potential
anticancer therapeutics have included agents that can
induce apoptosis, increase oxidative stress, inhibit the
global transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-κB), or suppress the relaxed cell cycle of cancer cells.
Numerous studies have shown that a wide range
of anticancer agents induce apoptosis in cancer cells in
vitro. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is crucial
for the elimination of abnormal cells and the prevention
of tumorigenesis [15]. Apoptosis involves two major
pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [16]. The
extrinsic pathway, also known as the death receptor
pathway, is triggered by a death ligand binding to a death
receptor, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).
The extrinsic pathway initiates the caspase-8 dependent
signal cascade. The intrinsic pathway, also known as the
mitochondrial pathway, involves the release of apoptotic
proteins, such as cytochrome c from mitochondria.
Cytochrome c recruits Apaf-1 and caspase-9 and forms
an apoptosome complex, which subsequently cleaves
caspase-9. Crosstalk can occur between the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways. Both pathways activate caspase-3, -6
and -7, and induce a variety of cellular events including
proteolysis and DNA fragmentation, which causes cell
death [15, 16].
Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the
production of free radicals, referred to as oxidants or
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a cell’s ability to
eliminate them by protective mechanisms is crucial for its
survival [17]. Oxidative stress often occurs from exposure
to ultra-violet (UV) light, environmental stress, or toxins.
When cells undergo oxidative stress, ROS accumulate in
the cells and damage intracellular molecules including
proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA [18]. Studies have shown
that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in a number of
conditions such as vascular disease, neurodegeneration,
anemia, auto-immune diseases, inflammatory responses
and cancer [19, 20]. ROS levels have opposing effects:
ROS activation below a specific threshold promotes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell survival; however, excessive ROS are known to be
toxic, leading to cell death [21]. It is well established that
oxidative stress induced by cancer therapy is essential to
fight cancers. Examples of chemotherapeutic treatments
that increase ROS are paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and
cisplatin [22].
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcription
factor that plays a critical role across many cellular
processes including embryonic and neuronal development,
immune responses to infection, inflammation, cell
proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis [23, 24, 25].
Because the NF-κB pathway regulates the transcription
of anti-apoptotic and cell proliferation genes, it is often
critical for the survival of cancer cells. There has been
increasing interest in targeting the NF-κB signaling
pathway as a therapeutic option for cancer treatments.
A variety of widely used anticancer agents suppress
proliferation and induce apoptosis of various cancer cells
by regulating NF-κB activities [23, 26].
In the present study, we demonstrated that the
cyclohexanedione DMDD dramatically inhibits the
proliferation of human breast, lung and bone cancer cells
in vitro. We further investigated the molecular mechanism
of DMDD’s anti-proliferation effects, and demonstrated
that DMDD suppresses the growth of breast carcinoma
cells via induction of G1 phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
oxidative stress, and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling
pathway.

RESULTS
DMDD exhibits anti-proliferation activity in
human breast, lung and bone cancer cells
Because the antidiabetic drug metformin is known
to be effective against breast cancer, we first evaluated
the anti-proliferation activity of DMDD in different types
of human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, BT20,
MDA-MB-231) and in the normal human mammary
epithelial cell lines (HMEC and MCF10A) as controls.
To test whether DMDD might be effective against other
cancers as well, we also tested DMDD in the human lung
carcinoma cell line A549 and the human osteosarcoma
cell line U2OS and in the normal human peripheral lung
epithelial cell line HPL1A and the normal human primary
umbilical vein endothelial cell line HUVEC as controls.
We observed a concentration dependent anti-proliferation
effect of DMDD in all tested cancerous cells after 48 h
treatment, with IC50 values ranging from 3.13 μM to 5.57
μM (Table 1). In contrast, DMDD exhibited significantly
less cytotoxicity against normal cells, especially mammary
epithelial cells, with IC50 values ranging from 9.0 to 48.8
μM. It is notable that treatment with 3.2 μM DMDD
caused a 25-57% growth inhibition of all of the cancerous

cells that were tested, but had no effect on any of the
normal cells that were tested.
A morphological examination of the cancerous
cells was performed using an inverted microscope. MCF7, BT20, MDA-MB-231, A549 and U2OS cells treated
with DMDD at various concentrations (3.2-100 μM) for
24 and 48 h showed significant morphological changes
indicative of apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage and reduced
cell density (data not shown). Because DMDD was most
effective and selective against breast cancer cells, we
chose to proceed with determining the mechanism of
action of DMDD in breast cancer cells.

integrity was examined by a mitochondrial membrane
potential dye which accumulates in healthy mitochondria
with intact membrane potential, but not in depolarized
mitochondria. Untreated MCF-7 and BT20 cells displayed
normal sized nuclei, intact plasma membrane and
brightly labeled mitochondria. After 24 h treatment with
DMDD, the cells exhibited increased plasma membrane
permeability as evidenced by higher green florescence
intensity and loss of mitochondrial potential as evidenced
by lower red florescence intensity, suggesting that they
were undergoing severe cellular injury (Figure 2A). We
observed dose-dependent effects of DMDD on membrane
permeability and mitochondrial potential in MCF-7 and
BT20 cells as shown in Figure 2C and 2D. In addition,
MCF-7 treated with 33 and 100 μM DMDD and BT20
cells treated with 100 μM DMDD showed a significant
decrease in nuclear size (***P < 0.001 or *P < 0.01)
(Figure 2B).

DMDD causes nuclear condensation, increase of
cell permeability and disruption of mitochondrial
potential in breast cancer cells
We examined the cellular changes of DMDD
treated cells including nuclear morphology, cell
membrane permeability and mitochondria membrane
potential (ΔΨm), in parallel using high-content screening
(HCS) analysis. The change of nuclear morphology was
monitored by Hoechst dye staining. The cell membrane
permeability was monitored by a permeability dye which
only stains nuclei in permeabilized cells. Mitochondrial

DMDD induces both the intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptosis pathways in human breast cancer cells
We employed the Annexin V/7-AAD double
staining assay to confirm that DMDD promoted apoptosis
in MCF-7 and BT20 cells. We found that DMDD induced

apoptosis in MCF-7 and BT20 cells (Figure 3A) and that
the apoptosis induction was concentration-dependent
(Figure 3B).
Next, we evaluated caspase 8, an early apoptotic
marker and initiator of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway;
caspase 9, an initiator of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway;
as well as caspase 3/7, the executioner caspase that
triggers apoptosis [28], using luminescence assays. As
shown in Figure 3C, 3D and 3E, in MCF-7 and BT20 cells
treated with DMDD for 4 h, the activities of caspase-3/7,
-8, and -9 increased significantly in a concentrationdependent manner compared to untreated cells (*P <
0.05, **P < 0.01 or ***P < 0.001). To further confirm
the caspase-dependency of DMDD-induced cell death,
we pre-treated MCF-7 and BT20 cells with the general
caspase inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[Omethyl]-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-FMK), and found
that 100 μM z-VAD-FMK exhibited significant protection
against cell death induced by 10-50 μM DMDD (**P <
0.01 or ***P < 0.001) (Figure 3F). Pretreatment with 100
μM of z-VAD-FMK could not attenuate the cytotoxicity
induced by 100 μM of DMDD (data not shown).
To clarify whether DMDD also induced the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway, we determined whether cytochrome c

was released from the mitochondria of the treated cells.
As shown in Figure 4A, cytochrome c was released from
the MCF-7 and BT20 cells treated by DMDD for 24 h. We
also investigated the regulation of apoptotic proteins using
a human apoptotic protein array. The protein expression
profile revealed that the death receptors TNF-α-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1
and TRAIL-R2), the pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2associated death promoter (Bad) and BH3 interactingdomain death agonist (BID), are significantly up-regulated
by DMDD (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, or ****P < 0.0001)
(Figure 4B). Meanwhile, the apoptosis inhibitors, cellular
inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP), X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (XIAP) and Survivin are significantly
down-regulated by DMDD (****P < 0.0001) (Figure 4C).

DMDD induces oxidative stress in human breast
cancer cells
We determined the effect of DMDD on cellular
ROS levels in MCF-7 and BT20 cells using HCS and
an oxidative stress assay. The generation of ROS in
cells was quantified by the oxidation of non-fluorescent
dihydroethidium (DHE) to fluorescent ethidium. As shown

in Figure 5B, a marked and immediate increase in ROS
generation was detected after 15 min of DMDD treatment
in both MCF-7 and BT-20 cells and after 24 h of DMDD
treatment even higher ROS levels were detected in both
MCF-7 and BT-20 cells, An intermediate concentration
of DMDD (32 μM) enhanced ROS levels nearly threefold versus the non-treated control, while high and low
concentrations (100 μM and 10 μM) of DMDD enhanced
ROS nearly two-fold versus the untreated control (Figure
5A and 5C). To further investigate whether DMDDinduced cytotoxicity was associated with ROS levels,
we co-treated MCF-7 or BT20 cells with the antioxidant
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and different concentrations
of DMDD for 48 h. We observed that 10 mM NAC

attenuated DMDD-induced cell death of breast cancer
cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5C).
It is notable that NAC almost completely reversed the
cytotoxic effect caused by 10 μM DMDD in both MCF-7
and BT20 cells.

DMDD arrests the cell cycle of cancer cells at G1
phase
To examine if DMDD altered the distribution of the
cell cycle, we performed a cell cycle analysis with MCF-7
and BT-20 cells. As shown in Figure 6, DMDD induced
a significant increase in the cell number at the G1 phase

after treatment for 24 h, with a corresponding decrease in
the S and G2-M phases in both breast cancer cell lines. In
MCF-7 cells, the percentage of G1 phase cells increased
from 52±2% to 67±2% at 10 μM concentration; and in
BT20 cells, the percentage of G1 phase cells increased
from 46±1% to 63±2% at 10 μM concentration. These
results suggest that DMDD disrupts the G1-S transition

DMDD suppresses the canonical NF-κB signaling
pathway
We assessed the ability of DMDD to inhibit NF-κB
activation induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α
by using anti-NF-κB p65 antibody conjugated with a
fluorescent dye to monitor the NF-κB translocation from
the cytoplasm to nuclear region. As shown in Figure 7C,
in non-treated MCF-7 cells, a high fluorescence intensity
of NF-κB was found in the cytoplasm, but rarely in the
nuclei, indicating that NF-κB is not activated under normal
conditions. Following stimulation with TNF-α, the NF-κB
fluorescent intensity significantly increased in the nuclear
region, indicating NF-κB translocation from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus. We observed significant inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation in both MCF7 and BT20 cells treated with DMDD as evidenced by
decreased intranuclear NF-κB fluorescence intensity (*P <

DMDD inhibits TNF-α production in LPS induced

μM DMDD did not affect the viability of THP-1 cells
after treatment with or without LPS stimulation (data not
shown). As shown in Figure 7A and 7B, DMDD caused a

MB-231, A549 and U2OS), while causing notably less
toxicity in the normal epithelial and endothelial cell lines
(HMEC, MCF-10A, HPL1A and HUVEC). Collectively,
our results indicate that DMDD is selective against cancer
cells, especially breast cancer cells. Consistent with
our in vitro findings, Zheng et al. [4] also showed that
administration of a single dose of DMDD at 5,000 mg/kg
body weight did not cause any acute toxicity in vivo.
The cytotoxic effect of DMDD on breast cancer
cells was accompanied by the induction of apoptosis.
In addition to nuclear condensation and mitochondrial
permeability changes shown by high-content screening
(HCS) multiplex cytotoxicity analysis, the dose-dependent
apoptosis induction was further confirmed by Annexin
V/7-AAD double staining and a marked and rapid
activation of several apoptosis-inducing caspases (-3/7, -8
and -9).
Apoptosis can be induced by either the intrinsic or
the extrinsic pathway. We found that both pathways were
activated during DMDD-induced cell death. Caspase-8,

however, in BT20 cells, the lowest concentration (10
μM) yielded more significant inhibition than medium
(32 μM) and high (100 μM) concentrations.To further
investigate the mechanism of DMDD suppression of
NF-κB activation, we examined the effects of DMDD
on TNF-α stimulated phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and
IκBα. As shown in Figure 7E, TNF-α stimulated strong
phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα, and the effect
was suppressed by the treatment with DMDD in a dosedependent manner. These results suggest that DMDD
suppresses the NF-κB canonical signaling pathway.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that the
cyclohexanedione DMDD potently inhibited the growth
of the human carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, BT20, MDA-

the initiator caspase of the extrinsic pathway, was
activated by DMDD and the death receptors TRAIL-R1
and TRAIL-R2 were upregulated in an apoptotic antibody
array. We also showed that DMDD-induced apoptosis
was accompanied by cytochrome c release, the hallmark
of apoptosis induction by the intrinsic pathway [29, 30].
Several studies have demonstrated evidence of cross talk
between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in apoptosis [31,
32]. In the extrinsic pathway, once caspase-8 is activated, it
can either directly cleave caspase-3 or cleave BID, which
subsequently translocates to the mitochondrial membrane,
disrupts the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and
releases cytochrome c [33]. Therefore, it’s not surprising
that DMDD activated both signaling pathways in
breast cancer cells. More importantly, we showed that
pretreatment with the general caspase inhibitor z-VADFMK rescued the cell viability of DMDD-treated MCF7
and BT20 cells, thus confirming the caspase-dependence
of DMDD-induced cell death.
Mitochondria are one of the main sources of ROS
in mammalian cells and the generation of ROS has
been suggested to be one of the causes of mitochondrial
disruption [34, 35, 36]. Evidence has also shown that ROS
are common mediators of apoptotic cell death [21]. In the
apoptotic process, initial stress-induced damage does not
kill cells directly; rather it triggers an apoptotic signaling
program that leads to cell death [37]. DMDD treatment
immediately induced a sustained ROS overproduction
in MCF-7 and BT20 cancer cells and co-treatment with
the general antioxidant NAC almost completely blocked
DMDD-induced cell death, suggesting that DMDDinduced oxidative stress is the underlying mechanism of
cytotoxicity. The elevation of intracellular ROS appears to
be an upstream signal that initiates the series of apoptotic
events induced by DMDD. Moreover, oxidative stress is
known to inhibit the transition of cells from G1 to the S
phase by oxidation of membrane lipids that prolong the G1
phase [21]. This is consistent with our finding that DMDD
inhibits the cell cycle transition from G1 to the S phase in
the cancer cells.
NF-κB has been associated with cancer due
to its ability to create a positive feedback loop of
inflammation [25]. While NF-κB is dormant in the
cytosol of normal cells, many cancer cells have been
shown to possess constitutively active NF-κB, either
due to mutations in the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, or in NFκB itself that allow for its continuous activation [38].
Without regulation, this ongoing activation enhances
cancer cell proliferation. Inhibition of NF-κB activation
blocks cancer cell proliferation and therefore targeting
the NF-κB signaling pathway has become an important
therapeutic option for cancer treatments. NF-κB may be
activated from its inactive precursors by two signaling
pathways: the canonical pathway (or classical pathway),
which is activated in the presence of inflammatory
cytokines or compounds, and the noncanonical pathway
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(or alternative pathway) which is activated during B
cell development [23]. The canonical pathway is most
usually associated with cancer, and is mainly activated
by TNF-α, IL-1, and LPS [39]. In the canonical pathway,
IκBα is phosphorylated by IKK, resulting in the nuclear
translocation of p65-containing heterodimers [40]. Our
results showed that DMDD not only significantly reduced
the TNF-α level in cells treated with LPS, but also
dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα and
NF-κB p65 as well as NF-κB p65 translocation from the
cytoplasm to the nuclei. These results suggest that DMDD
serves as an inhibitor of the canonical NF-κB pathway in
human breast carcinoma cells and can potentially prevent
the initial inflammatory cascade in cancer cells that drives
further proliferation.
How DMDD-induced oxidative stress is involved in
the negative regulation of NF-κB pathway is an interesting
question. ROS can regulate NF-κB activation both
positively or negatively through various mechanisms that
are dependent on the cell type [41, 42, 43]. It is known that
sustained oxidative stress can inhibit NF-κB activation
by glutathionylation of IκBα [43] or by inactivating
the proteasome [44]. Thus DMDD-induced sustained
oxidative stress can potentially prevent NF-κB pathway
activation through the above mentioned mechanisms. In
future experiments, the detailed mechanism of DMDDinduced NF-κB inactivation and its regulation by ROS will
be investigated.

CONCLUSION
DMDD induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells
through the generation of intracellular ROS and the
inhibition of NF-kB activation. DMDD-induced apoptosis
in breast cancer cells involved both the extrinsic and
intrinsic signaling pathways and DMDD inhibited the
activation of each step of the canonical NF-κB signaling
pathway as shown in Figure 8. DMDD affects the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway by suppressing TRAIL receptors and
caspase 8, and affects the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by
damaging mitochondrial membrane potential, releasing
cytochrome c and activating caspase 9 and caspase
3/7. DMDD also inhibits the production of TNF-α and
suppresses the phosphorylation of IκBα, which leads to
IκBα degradation and release of NF-κB. DMDD further
inhibits NF-κB phosphorylation and translocation to the
nucleus, which subsequently inhibits transcription of
target genes including anti-apoptotic proteins such as
cIAP, XIAP and Survivin. The ability of DMDD to inhibit
the growth of human breast carcinoma cells without
severe toxicity to normal cells indicates that DMDD is
a promising candidate for cancer treatment, and results
from this study suggest a potential important mechanism
of DMDD for cancer therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

µM, 3.2 µM, 1 µM, and 0.32 µM. An experimental control
with cells only was also included. After incubation for 48
h, the viability of cells was assessed using PrestoBlue dye
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The
fluorescence intensity was measured on a SpectraMax
M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) at a
fluorescent excitation wavelength of 555 nm and emission
wavelength of 590 nm. The results were expressed as a
percentage, relative to untreated control cells, and the
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were
calculated using non-linear regression analysis. For the
caspase inhibitor assay, the cells were treated with 100 μM
z-VAD-FMK (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 1 h, and treated
with different concentrations of DMDD for 24 h before
the viability test. For the NAC attenuation assay, the cells
were treated with different concentrations of DMDD
followed by incubation with or without 10 mM NAC
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 48 h, and then cell viability
was assessed.

Plant materials and extraction and isolation of
DMDD
The plant material Averrhoa carambola L. was
collected from Linshan County, Guangxi Autonomous
Region, China, in June 2010 and was identified by Prof.
Lai Mao-xiang. The collections were carried out on private
land under the permission of the land owner. The voucher
specimen (No. 20100605) was deposited in the Guangxi
Institute of Chinese Medicine & Pharmaceutical Science
herbarium (Guangxi, China). The isolation of DMDD was
performed as described by Zheng et al. [4]. DMDD stock
solutions were prepared by dissolving DMDD in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM. In all
tests, the DMDD stock solution was further diluted in cell
culture medium by 100 fold or more, and 1% DMSO was
used as a vehicle control in the untreated cells.

Multi-parameter cytotoxicity measurement

Cell culture

MCF-7 and BT20 cells were seeded in a 96-well
plate (Corning, USA) at a density of 4,000 cells/well
and subsequently treated with different concentrations
(10, 32, 100 μM) of DMDD. Cells treated with DMSO
only and cells treated with 100 μM Valinomycin (SigmaAldrich, USA) served as negative and positive controls,
respectively. After 24 h, the cells were stained with a
mixture of fluorescent dyes including Hoechst 33342,
cell permeability dye and mitochondrial membrane
potential dye (Thermo Scientific, USA). These dyes
indicated changes in nuclear morphology (Channel 1), cell
membrane permeability (Channel 2) and mitochondrial
trans-membrane potential (Channel 3), respectively.
The cells were fixed and washed, and images for each
fluoroprobe were acquired at different channels using
suitable filters with a 20X objective and analyzed on
the Arrayscan VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Scientific,
USA). The Cell Health Profiling BioApplication
(Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for image acquisition
and analysis. For each well, at least 400 cells were
automatically acquired and analyzed. The average
fluorescent intensity was used to quantify changes in each
channel.

BT20, A549, and THP-1 (ATCC, USA) were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (ATCC, USA) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) with 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
HMEC and U2OS (ATCC, USA) were maintained in
McCoy’s 5A medium (ATCC, USA). MCF-10A (ATCC,
USA) was maintained in MEBM basal medium (Lonza
corporation, USA) supplemented with the MEGM
SingleQuot Kit (Lonza corporation, USA) and 100 ng/ml
cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). HPL1A was obtained
from Nagoya University, Japan, and maintained in
DMEM/F-12K medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). HUVEC
(ATCC, USA) was maintained in Vascular Cell Basal
Medium (ATCC, USA) supplemented with the Endothelial
Cell Growth Kit-BBE (ATCC, USA). All mediums were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life
Technologies, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and all cells were incubated in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

was used for image acquisition and analysis. For each
well, at least 400 cells were automatically acquired and
analyzed. Oxidative stress activation was assessed by the
DHE staining in the nucleus and measured by the average
intensity of fluorescent ethidium in the identified nuclear
region (MEAN_CircAvgIntenCh2).

Cytochrome c release assay
MCF-7 and BT20 cells were seeded in a 96-well
plate (Corning, USA) at a density of 8,000 cells/well
and were subsequently treated with 100 µM of DMDD
for 24 h. The percentage of cells releasing cytochrome c
from mitochondria was determined using the FlowCellect
Cytochrome c Kit (Millipore, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were permeabilized,
fixed, and stained with either anti-IgG1-FITC Isotype
control or anti-Cytochrome c-FITC dye. Data was
acquired and analyzed using a Guava flow cytometer and
InCyte software (Millipore, USA).

MCF-7 and BT20 cells were first synchronized in
the G0 phase by culturing cells for 24 h in serum-free
medium, and then treated with 100 μM DMDD for 24 h.
Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide
(PI) (Millipore, USA) staining as described [27]. Cells
were analyzed using a Guava flow cytometer with InCyte
software (Millipore, USA).

Caspase-3/7, -8, -9 activation assays

Human TNF-α ELISA

Caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 activities were analyzed
using an in-situ luminescent maker in MCF-7 and
BT20 cells respectively. Cells were seeded in a whitewalled 96-well plate (Greiner, USA) and treated with
different concentrations (10, 32, 100 μM) of DMDD
for 4 h. Caspase activities were then determined using
the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega, USA), CaspaseGlo 8 Assay (Promega, USA), or the Caspase-Glo 9
Assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, equal volumes of Caspase-Glo 3/7, 8
or 9 reagents containing protease inhibitor MG-132 were
added to the treated cells in a final volume of 200μl per
well. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h
and the luminescence of each sample was measured using
a SpectraMax M5 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices,
USA). Cells treated with DMSO only served as the
negative control, and the data is shown as fold-induction
relative to the negative control.

THP-1 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a
density of 5x105 cells/well, and incubated with 100 nM
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) for 72 h. After washing the wells with warm
RPMI 1640 medium, cells were pretreated with various
concentrations (12.5, 25, 50 μM) of DMDD for 30 minutes
followed by stimulation with 100 ng/ml Salmonella
enterica serotype typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 4 h. Dexamethasone (SigmaAldrich, USA) at 1 µM was used as a positive control.

permeabilized, and sequentially stained with NF-κB p65
primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, USA),
DyLight 488-conjugated secondary antibody, and Hoechst
33342 dye. The Hoechst and DyLight fluorophores detect
changes in nuclear morphology (blue fluorescence) and
NF-κB distribution (green fluorescence), respectively. The
samples were analyzed on an Arrayscan VTI HCS Reader
(Thermo Scientific, USA). The Nuclear Translocation
BioApplication (Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for
image acquisition and analysis. For each well, at least

MCF-7 and BT20 cells were seeded in a 96-well
tissue culture-treated plate (Corning, USA) at a density
of 8,000 cells/well and were subsequently treated with
different concentrations (10, 32, 100 μM) of DMDD for
24 h. Cells treated with DMSO only served as the negative
control, and cells treated with 1 μM Retenone (SigmaAldrich, USA) served as the positive control. Afterwards,
the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo
Scientific, USA) and dihydroethidium (DHE) (SigmaAldrich, USA), fixed and evaluated on an ArrayScan VTI
HCS Reader (Thermo Scientific, USA). The generation
of ROS in cells was quantified by the oxidation of
