ABSTRACT
Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is both a tumor suppressor and an oncoprotein. Cav-1
overexpression was frequently confirmed in advanced cancer stages and positively
associated with ABC transporters, cancer stem cell populations, aerobic glycolysis
activity and autophagy. Cav-1 was tied to various stresses including radiotherapy,
fluid shear and oxidative stresses and ultraviolet exposure, and interacted with stress
signals such as AMP-activated protein kinase. Finally, a Cav-1 fluctuation model
during cancer development is provided and Cav-1 is suggested to be a stress signal
and cytoprotective. Loss of Cav-1 may increase susceptibility to oncogenic events.
However, research to explore the underlying molecular network between Cav-1 and
stress signals is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

(multidrug resistance protein 1, MRP1) and ABCG2
(BCRP), are thought to affect cancer chemosensitivity
[4]. Numerous natural or synthetic inhibitors targeting
ABC transporters were developed to reverse MDR.
However, neither strong evidence nor clinical trial data are
available to confirm the feasibility of these inhibitors for
improving chemotherapeutic bioavailability or restoring
drug sensitivity in resistant cancer patients [5]. Insufficient
specificity, potency and intrinsic toxicity obstruct
identifying ideal inhibitors to suppress ABC transporter
activity. Also, substantial overlapping specificities exist
among major ABC transporters, and some ABC proteins
are expressed on vital organs for protective functions [6].
Thus, finding novel membrane transporters related to
MDR is required for designing better drugs.
Caveolin-1(Cav-1) is an essential constituent protein
of specialized membrane invaginations, referred to as
caveolae. Research indicates that Cav-1 is a molecular
hub, integrating transduction of multiple signals including
Src, EGFR, HER2, and the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) cascade [7]. Cav-1 silencing was reported
to result in activation of these survival signals and promote

Multidrug resistance (MDR) can influence cancer
clinical outcomes and ~90% of cancer mortality is
correlated to primary or acquired MDR and consequent
metastases [1]. Thus, elucidating underlying molecular
mechanisms of MDR can improve clinical outcomes for
cancer patients. Currently three major mechanisms of
MDR have been proposed: decreased chemotherapeutic
uptake, absorption and distribution; aberrant drug
metabolism that diminishes therapeutic efficacy, such
as target alterations, DNA damage repair and cell death
signaling pathway dysregulation; and finally, increased
energy-dependent efflux of hydrophobic drugs by ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporters [2].
Of these mechanisms, drug efflux by ABC
transporters may explain more MDR. ABC transporters
are encoded by 48 genes and classified into seven
subfamilies (ABCA-ABCG) based on sequence homology
and domain organization [3]. To date, sixteen members
have been identified, but only three major ABC drug
transporters, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCC1

cancer transformation and initiation [7]. Meanwhile,
loss of Cav-1 was frequently observed in various types
of malignancies such as breast and colon cancers and
ovarian carcinomas [8]. Therefore, Cav-1 may be a tumor
suppressor gene. Recent work also indicates that Cav-1
may be a stress-related molecule mediating cancer drug
resistance and metastasis. Cav-1 was up-regulated in MDR
colon cancer cells, adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells
and taxol- and gemcitabine-resistant lung cancer cells [9].
Research indicated that Cav-1 expression was positively
correlated to ABCB1 in various cancers such as acute
myeloid leukemia [10-12]. Clinical findings also suggested
that cancer patients with high Cav-1 expression had a
worse chemotherapeutic response and worse progressionfree survival or overall survival [13]. Moreover, Cav-1 was
highly expressed on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and affected
CSCs’ chemosensitivity [14]. Also, Cav-1 was found to be
a critical regulator of aerobic glycolysis, a key metabolic
switch influencing cancer chemosensitivity [15]. Finally,
Cav-1 inhibition was shown to be correlated to autophagic
induction, an important regulatory mechanism to protect
cells from stress. However, autophagy overactivation can
cause type II programmed cell death [16]. These data
suggest that Cav-1 might be a stress-response protein and
involved in the modulation of cancer chemosensitivity.
Thus, targeting Cav-1 may offer a novel strategy for
preventing cancer drug resistance and improving clinical
outcomes.
Here, we summarize current evidence of a
relationship between Cav-1 and cancer drug resistance,
discuss pathophysiological implications of this pathway
and propose a targeted therapeutic strategy. A greater
understanding of Cav-1 and its role in modulating drug
resistance will help us understand cancer therapy and
discover better chemotherapeutics.

domain (CSD) is a region that can mediate protein-protein
interactions, such as Src-family tyrosine kinases, H-Ras,
HER2, estrogen receptor, MAPK and G protein-coupled
receptors (Figure 1) [7, 19]. Moreover, due to alternative
splicing or initiation, Cav-1 exists in two isoforms, α or
β. Cav-1β is distinct in that it has a 31 amino acid residue
deletion at the amino terminus [7].
Cav-1 was initially described as a prevalent target
for tyrosine phosphorylation in Rous sarcoma virus
transformed chicken fibroblasts. Upon stimulation by
agonists including insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF),
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), mechanical stress
or oxidative stress, tyrosine 14 site of Cav-1 can be
phosphorylated, subsequently transmitting extracellular
signals via intracellular pathways [21]. Co-localization
and co-fractionation bioassays demonstrated that Cav-1
not only interacted with many signal transduction proteins,
such as Ras-p44/42 MAPK, Her-2, src family kinases and
eNOS, but also inhibited their catalytic activity [22]. Many
components of the Ras-p44/42 MAPK cascade localize
within caveolae, including EGFR, PDGFR, H-Ras, Raf
kinase, ERK1/2 kinases, Shc and Grb [23-25]. Suppression
of Ras-p42/44 MAPK activity by treatment of PD98059 (a
MAPK kinase inhibitor) was found to upregulate Cav-1
expression in Ras-transformed cells [26]. In contrast, Cav1 overexpression inhibited Ras-p42/44 MAPK signaling
by acting as an endogenous inhibitor of EGFR, MEK1 and ERK1/2 in vitro and in vivo via the CSD domain
[27]. Similar reciprocal regulation was also observed
between Cav-1 and c-ErbB2, a proto-oncogene encoding
Her-2 in human breast carcinomas. Cav-1 expression is
significantly reduced in mammary tumors of c-ErbB2
transgenic mice [28]. Conversely, Cav-1 upregulation
blocks Her-2 mediated signal transduction in vivo by
directly inhibiting the Her-2 autophosphorylation via its
CSD domain [27]. In addition, Cav-1 is known to bind and
sequester Src family kinases in an inactive configuration
[29, 30]. Accordingly, Cav-1 deprivation leads to a
marked increase in Src family tyrosine kinase activity,
and therefore significantly contributes to the migration
and anchorage-dependent growth of osteosarcoma cells
[31]. Meanwhile, Cav-1 loss is suggested to trigger
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
and induce cell transformation in mammary epithelial
cell line MCF-10ACE [32]. Furthermore, Cav-1 was
shown to participate in the formation of a multi-protein
complex, which includes E-cadherin/β-catenin and helps
sequester β-catenin to the membrane, thereby precluding
β-catenin/Tcf-Lef-dependent transcription of genes such
as survivin, COX-2 and cyclin D1 [33]. Notably, Cav-1
was also shown to inhibit eNOS enzymatic activity and
nitric oxide production in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
fashion [34]. Overall, Cav-1 was reported to have a
central role in regulating cell survival, proliferation, and
apoptosis. Elucidation of Cav-1 in cancer development
and progression may be significant for improving patient

CAV-1 SIGNALING
Caveolins are 21-24 KDa membrane-associated
proteins highly enriched in caveolae [17]. Each caveolae
contains approximately 100 to 200 caveolin molecules
formed by three principle members, Cav-1, -2, and -3
[18]. Cav-1 and -2 are ubiquitously co-expressed on
epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth
muscle cells, adipocytes and pneumocytes, while Cav-3
expression is mainly restricted to muscle and glia cells
[19]. The CAV1 gene consists of three exons and maps to
7q31.1, where is close to a known fragile site (FRA7G)
frequently deleted in cancer. CAV1 encodes a 21- to 24kDa integral membrane protein, and the topology of Cav-1
can be divided into three domains including a C-terminal
spanning domain (residues 135-150), a transmembrane
domain (residues 102-134), an N-terminal scaffolding
domain (residues 82-101) and an oligomerization domain
(residues 61-101). Both the C- and N-termini face the
cytoplasm (Figure 1) [20]. Notably, the Cav-1 scaffolding

clonogenic capacity and promoted features of muscular
differentiation [37]. Next, Cav-1 associates with known
tumor suppressors. In MCF-7 cells, transfection of murine
Cav-1 cDNA led to increased BRCA1 transcription and
protein overexpression in a P53 dependent manner [38].
BRCA1 was also found to activate the Cav-1 promoter
region and induce redistribution of Cav-1 from the
cytoplasm to the cell membrane [39]. Several studies
indicate that Cav-1 expression was positively correlated
with PTEN in mammalian cells, and Cav-1 restoration
in fibroblasts could elevate membrane PTEN, inhibit
Akt phosphorylation, and suppress proliferation [40]. In
addition, a series of tumor suppressors including deleted
in liver cancer 1 (DLC-1), INK4a and RB, were revealed
to be closely correlated to Cav-1 status [41-43]. Finally,
in vivo studies confirmed that the absence of Cav-1
resulted in mammary ductal hyperplasia, precocious
lobuloalveolar development and gestational lactation
[44]. Meanwhile, hybridization of Cav-1 knockout
mice with tumor prone transgenic mice (MMTV-PyVT)
decreased tumor development latency, doubled tumor
burden and lung metastatic lesions [28, 45]. Accumulating
evidence indicates that Cav-1 was significantly reduced
or absent in mammary tumors from MMTV-c-Myc,
-Her2, -Src, -Ha-Ras and p53 null transgenic mice [46].
Notably, clinical studies with microarray analysis and

CAV-1 AND CANCER DEVELOPMENT
Despite advancements in understanding Cav1 structure and function, the relationship between
dysfunctional Cav-1 and tumorigenesis is unclear.
Downregulation of Cav-1 and its tumor suppression
function has been validated in breast, colon, and ovarian
cancer and soft-tissue sarcomas. First, studies show
that Cav-1 is negatively associated with cancer cells’
transformation. Xie’s group found that Cav-1 expression
was significantly down-regulated in 3-phosphoinositidedependent
protein
kinase-1
(PDK1)-mediated
transformation of mammary epithelial cells [35]. Another
study revealed that stable expression of HPV E6 viral
oncoprotein in NIH 3T3 cells increased Cav-1 protein.
In contrast, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Cav1 in SiHa cells, a human cervical squamous carcinoma
cell line, abrogated their anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar [36]. Similar findings were also
validated in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. The Cav-1
expression was found either undetectable or very low
in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas cell lines and tumor
samples, whereas Cav-1 reintroduction impaired cells

receptors, and eNOS and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In addition, the scaffolding domain may mediate proteasome degradation of

immunohistochemistry revealed that Cav-1 expression
was equally decreased in either mammary invasive lobular
carcinomas or invasive ductal carcinomas [47]. Similar
findings were also confirmed in other malignancies
including colon and ovarian cancers and osteosarcomas
[47].
Intriguingly, opposing evidence supports a
role for Cav-1 as a tumor-promoting protein. Cav1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is positively
associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1
expression is correlated to Ki67, P53 in tumor tissues
and serum CA 19-9 serum [48]. Other work suggested
that Cav-1 expression was significantly correlated to
tumor diameter, histological grade and poor prognosis in
pancreatic cancer, and indicated that Cav-1 might be an
independent negative predictor of survival [49]. Similar
findings were confirmed in renal cancer. Campbell’s
group suggested that high Cav-1 expression was closely
correlated to larger and higher grade tumors, as well as
microvessel density, and survival analysis confirmed that
increased Cav-1 staining portended shorter survival [50].
In hepatocellular carcinoma, Cav-1 expression was also
markedly upregulated in specimens or cell lines, and
Cav-1 upregulation positively correlated with histological
differentiation, venous invasion, intrahepatic metastasis
and VEGF expression [51]. Even in breast cancer, a strong
association was found between elevated Cav-1 and a basallike phenotype [52]. Cav-1 expression was upregulated
in inflammatory breast cancer cells and tissues [53] and
Cav-1 overexpression significantly contributed to cancer
metastasis. With using proteomic identification, Cav-1 was

found to be elevated in metastatic hepatocellular cancer
cell lines [54]. A microarray analysis also supported Cav-1
as a metastasis-related gene by comparing gene expression
profiles between weakly and highly invasive breast cancer
cells [55]. Specifically, Cav-1 silencing was effective for
reducing metastatic activity of prostate cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo, whereas Cav-1 restoration was shown
to enhance the motility of tumor cells in lung cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma [56]. In addition,
as early as 2001, Hayashi’s group reported that the Cav1 mutant form P132L was identified in 16% of primary
breast cancers and mutation-positive cases were mostly
invasive scirrhous carcinomas [57]. Subsequent studies
revealed that Cav-1 (P132L) behaves in a dominantnegative manner, causing mislocalization and intracellular
retention of WT Cav-1 [58]. Mechanistic investigation
further verified that Cav-1 (P132L) upregulated the
expression of estrogen receptor-α and significantly
increased cell migration, invasion and experimental
metastasis. Gene profile analysis demonstrated that
Cav-1 (P132L) mutation was associated with stem cell/
metastasis-associated gene signature, including Cdcp1,
Cyr61, Fox1a, Krt14, Pif, Tacstd1, Tnc and Wnt10a [59].
However, several studies also claimed that the P132L
mutation was not identified in breast cancer samples,
either by direct DNA sequencing or restriction fragment
length polymorphism analysis [60-63]. Thus, reevaluating
the existence and frequency of P132L mutations in breast
cancer is needed. Here, we summarize conflicting evidence
regarding Cav-1 during cancer development (Figure 2).
Cav-1 may be a duplex signal during cancer progression,

and its expression status might be closely correlated to
tumor stage. During cancer transformation and initiation,
Cav-1 acted as a tumor suppressor gene in breast, lung,
cervical, gastric, glioma and pancreatic malignancies
[64-69]. Cav-1 loss not only inactivate tumor suppressors
BRCA1, P53 and PTEN but also promoted cell cycle
progression and activated pro-survival signaling such as
PI3K/Akt and MAPK [36, 38, 70]. However, with cancer
advanced progression, Cav-1 re-expression was observed
in various cancers including breast, lung, prostate, liver,
ovarian, pancreas, melanoma, thyroid, colorectal, gastric,
renal and pleomorphic malignancies [51, 54, 57, 71-79].
Cav-1 overexpression was found in metastatic lesions of
breast cancer and was closely correlated with tumor stage
and clinical prognosis [80]. Meanwhile, Cav-1 positively
correlated with CSC self-renewal and the tumor biomarker
CA19-9 in cancer patients [81, 82]. These data suggest
that validating Cav-1 in cancer development with time
point-guided detection and genetic intervention tools to
investigate the function of Cav-1 in different cancer stages
are needed. Although the underlying mechanisms of Cav-1
fluctuation during cancer progression are unclear, studies
to better understand the therapeutic and prognostic values
of Cav-1 for cancer—especially for chemosensitivity and
chemoresistance—are underway.

after whole body irradiation [88]. In a prostate cancer
animal model, combined dasatinib and anti-Cav1 antibody
treatment or sunitinib and anti-Cav1 antibody produced
greater tumor regression than either treatment alone [89].
More importantly, a clinical study revealed that Cav-1
expression was correlated to chemotherapy response in
non-small lung cancer. Patients who had tumors samples
with strong Cav-1 staining had less response to therapy
and worse progression-free and overall survival [90].
Similar findings were also confirmed on gastric cancer.
Cav-1 was positively associated with tumor stage and
nodal status, and was inversely correlated with the
response to ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil)
chemotherapy administrated to gastric cancer patients [91].
Another study validated the value of Cav-1 in predicting
chemoresponse. A comprehensive methylation microarray
analysis of 49 patients with advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), suggested that Cav-1 was a powerful
predictor for therapeutic response after platinum-taxane
based treatment [92]. Cav-1 methylation was significantly
associated with improved overall survival [92]. Therefore,
the underlying mechanisms between Cav-1 and cancer
chemosensitivity modulation warrant study.

IMPLICATION OF CAV-1 IN CANCER
DRUG RESISTANCE

Since the discovery of the first ABC family member,
ABCB1, in multidrug resistant ovarian cancer cells in
1976, research to identify drug transporters contributing
to cancer drug resistance has been underway. Currently, at
least seven ABC subfamilies (A-G) encoded by 48 genes
have been identified [4]. Among them, ABCB1 is the
most well-studied target to regulate cancer drug resistance
and develop chemosensitizing agents. Numerous
studies show that ABCB1 can extrude hydrophobic
compounds central to most chemotherapeutic regimens,
including vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, taxanes and
epipodophyllotoxins [93]. In addition, some tyrosine
kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib and erlotinib,
can be exported by ABCB1 [94]. ABCB1 is normally
expressed in the transport epithelium of the liver, kidney
and gastrointestinal tract so it is difficult to justify the
role of ABCB1 for predicting chemosensitivity of tumors
originating from these sites. However, clinical studies
revealed a positive correlation between ABCB1 expression
and poor prognosis in breast cancer, sarcoma and certain
types of leukemia, because ABCB1-positive biopsies from
these cancers can be compared with ABCB1-negative
patients [95]. Interestingly, a close association has been
observed between Cav-1 and ABCB1. Both proteins are
predominantly located in the Lubrol-based detergentinsoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains
and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirm that Cav1 interacts with ABCB1 in brain capillaries, rat brain
endothelial, Chinese hamster ovary and breast cancer cells
[96]. Sucrose gradient fractionation revealed that Cav-1

CAV-1 AND ABC TRANSPORTERS

Studies suggest that Cav-1 is a chemotherapyresponse gene independent of cancer type. Cav-1
expression was significantly upregulated in a series of
drug-resistant cancer cells. In a taxol-resistant (9-fold
resistant to taxol) lung cancer cell line A549, Cav-1
expression increased 3.4-folds compared to the parental
cell line. Increasing resistance taxol to 17-fold, increased
Cav-1 expression 9.5-fold [83]. Meanwhile, increased
Cav-1 expression has been reported in other drugresistant cancer cells, such as SKVLB1 cells resistant to
vinblastine, HT-29 cells resistant to colchicine and MCF-7
cells resistant to adriamycin [83, 84]. In addition, Cav1 expression is significantly induced after treating lung
cancer cells with etoposide or bleomycin, indicating
that Cav-1 might be a stress-related protein [11]. Thus,
genetic and pharmacological studies confirmed a
correlation between Cav-1 and drug resistance. Cav-1
silencing increased chemosensitivity or radiosensitivity
in diverse cancer cells such as Ewing’s sarcoma cells
A4573, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells MDCKII
and the pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2 [84-86].
Cav-1 silencing increased susceptibility of human renal
carcinoma cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and
inhibited lung metastasis. In contrast, Cav-1 restoration
promoted resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
in Ewing’s sarcoma cells [87]. Cav-1 knockout mice had
less survival compared with the Cav-1 wide-type mice

co-localized with ABCB1 in lipid rafts. The interaction
seems to be mediated by a Cav-1-binding motif in the
N-terminal portion of ABCB1 (37-FSMFRYSNW-45)
[97]. Clinical studies indicated a positive correlation
between Cav-1 and ABCB1 mRNA in acute myeloid
leukemia independent of tumor stage [9]. However,
studies suggested that Cav-1-regulated chemosensitivity
was ABCB1 independent. In ABCB1 deficient taxolresistant A549 cancer cells, Cav-1 upregulation was
observed [83] and Cav-1 overexpression correlated with
little ABCB1 protein expression in human ovarian cancer
cells, and ABCB1 overexpression was not localized in
caveolae [98]. Although accumulating evidence suggested
a potential molecular interaction between Cav-1 and
ABCB1, detailed signaling pathways between the two
molecules are unknown, and more studies of Cav-1 to
understand the transcriptional and translational expression
of ABCB1 are urgently needed.
Other than ABCB1, ABCG2 is a high-capacity
transporter widely expressed in drug resistant cancer
cells. ABCG2 substrates include organic anion conjugates,
nucleoside analogs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, organic
dyes, cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate and food toxins
or carcinogens. Compared with ABCB1, ABCG2 is
a mediator of MDR in breast, colon, small cell lung,
ovarian, gastric and intestinal cancers and melanomas
[99]. Several reports also indicated a potential correlation
between Cav-1 and ABCG2. Cav-1 silencing in MDCKIIBCRP cells led to a reduction of ABCG2 activity by 35%
[86]. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated
a physical interaction between Cav-1 and ABCG2, which
were co-localized in detergent-resistant membranes [11].
Another study indicated that Cav-1 was highly expressed
on breast cancer stem cells or side-population cells, which
were enriched with ABCG2. Furthermore, Cav-1 silencing
may decrease ABCG2 expression via accelerating
β-catenin proteasomal degradation [14]. Because CSCs
are considered a root of drug resistance, the study also
suggested a role for Cav-1 in regulating chemosensitivity
mediated by stem cells.

of CSCs. Research with CSCs suggests that they are
relatively resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
High expressions of ABCG2, ABCB1, or ABCC1 were
validated in CSCs in various cancers, and the ability of
CSCs to extrude Hochest 33342 by ABCG2 was used to
develop the “side population” method, which is frequently
used to isolate stem-like cells from primary tumors or
cancer cell lines [102]. Clinical studies also revealed a
positive correlation between CSCs population size and
poor prognosis in cancer patients. Neumeister’s group
applied CD44 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)
biomarkers to define CSCs in formalin-fixed paraffinembedded breast cancer tissue. Through a retrospective
analysis of 642 patients, they found that specimens with
high expression of both markers predicted worse outcomes
(P = 0.0003), and multivariate analysis confirmed that
the marker combination is independent of tumor size,
histological grade, nodal status, ER, PR, and HER2 status
[103]. Meanwhile, another study reported that during
neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer patients,
ALDH1-positive tumors were significantly associated with
a low pathological complete response. More importantly,
the proportion of ALDH1-positive cancer cells increased
dramatically (P < 0.001) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
indicating that CSCs were relatively chemoresistant [104].
Similar to breast cancer, a meta-analysis of hepatocellular
carcinoma patients revealed that the presence of CSCs
was significantly associated with a poor histological grade
(OR = 3.16, P = 0.003), overall survival (HR = 1.62, P
< 0.00001) and disease-free survival (HR = 1.85, P <
0.00001). Notably, there were no significant correlation
between the populations of CSCS and tumor size, tumor
stage, hepatitis and cirrhosis, indicating that CSCs subset
might be an independent factor influencing the clinical
outcomes of cancer patients [105]. At present, mechanisms
underlying therapeutic resistance of CSCs have not been
fully elucidated. However, several mechanisms have been
suggested, including: (i) stem cells remain quiescent,
making them resistant to cell-cycle active drugs; (ii) high
DNA repair ability; (iii) high expression of drug efflux
proteins such as ABCG2; and (iv) most current therapies
do not target signaling pathways regulating CSCs selfrenewal. Elucidation of molecular networks regulating
drug sensitivity of CSCs might be essential for eliminating
cancer cells.
In recent years, increasing interests have been paid to
explore the possible link between Cav-1 and stem cells. It
was found that in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
Cav-1 expression was significantly increased when cells
were induced to senescence, while Cav-1 lost remarkably
increased the proliferation of MSCs, indicating that
Cav-1 might be closely associated with the maintenance
and self-renewal abilities of stem cells [106]. Cav-1 has
positive effects on mediating estradiol-17β 0or fibronectininduced mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation and
DNA synthesis via RhoA-PI3K/Akt-ERK1/2 pathway

CAV-1 AND CSCS
The first compelling evidence of CSCs came from
acute myeloid leukemia in 1997 which indicated that
only CD34+CD38- cells could passage hematopoietic
malignancy in NOD/SCID mice after serial dilution
[100]. Similar phenomena were subsequently validated
in various types of cancers, such as breast cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric and lung cancers. Based
on accumulating evidence, the American Association for
Cancer Research (AACR) defined CSCs as “a cell within
a tumor that possesses the capacity to self-renew and to
cause heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise
the tumor” [101]. Therefore, self-renewal and multidifferentiation abilities are considered basic characteristics

[107]. With regard to the multi-differentiation ability
of stem cells, several reports also indicated that Cav-1
knockdown could enhance human MSC osteogenesis,
and bone marrow MSCs from the Cav-1 knockout mice
had greater osteogenic potential [106]. Cav-1 null mouse
mammary gland also showed dramatically accelerated
lobuloalveolar development, early milk production
and a premature lactation phenotype during lactation,
indicating that Cav-1 lost might favor the differentiation
process of mammary epithelial cells [108]. Mechanistic
studies suggest that Cav-1 expression and caveolar
structure help maintain pluripotency marker expression
(Oct4, Sox2, FoxD3, Rex1) in mouse embryonic stem
cells [109]. All of these findings suggested that Cav-1
may influence self-renewal and multi-differentiation of
stem cells. With regard to CSCs, it was found that nitric
oxide administration promoted CSC-like phenotype via
elevating Cav-1 expression in lung cancer cells [110].
Also, through genome-wide transcription profile analysis,
Cav-1 was identified as a key protein for determining the
formation of lung CSCs in a carbon nantotube-induced
carcinogenesis animal model. Cav-1 was confirmed to
be enriched in lung CSCs and significantly promoted
tumorigenesis and metastasis through P53 dysregulation
[81]. Emerging studies suggested that Cav-1 may
regulate chemoresistance of CSCs. Yuan’s group found
that epirubicin increased the activity of the human Wnt6
promoter through Cav1-dependent binding of β-catenin
to the proximal Wnt6 promoter in gastric cancer, which
is considered an important regulator of CSCs [91].
Another study of Wang’s group confirmed that Cav-1
was upregulated in breast CSCs compared with nonCSCs. In addition, Cav-1 silencing sensitized breast
CSCs by limiting their self-renewal ability but promoting
differentiation through β-catenin regulation. Meanwhile,
in vivo animal models indicated that Cav-1 silencing
significantly impaired tumorigenicity and chemoresistance
of breast CSCs [14]. Thus, current research for Cav-1 in
mediating therapeutic resistance of CSCs is limited to a
few cancer types, and a more comprehensive approach is
needed to validate a critical role of Cav-1 for determining
the therapeutic response of CSCs in cancers, and to clarify
the physiological function of Cav-1 in maintaining stem
cell survival and its molecular network. The hybridization
of Cav-1-null mice with a spontaneous cancer model may
be helpful.

cancer cells have developed altered metabolism that
permits greater proliferation rates. Cancer cells could
predominantly produce energy by glycolysis followed
by lactic acid fermentation, even in the presence
of oxygen—known as the “Warburg Effect” [111].
Currently, the phenomenon has been exploited clinically
to detect tumors by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET). Some key enzymes involved in
the glycolysis pathway were also developed as promising
targets for cancer therapy and drug development.
LDH-A is one such attractive target in the glycolytic
pathway because its expression is largely confined to
skeletal muscle. Moreover, human subjects with LDH-A
deficiency only experience myoglobinuria under intense
anaerobic exercise, and individuals with a complete lack
of the LDH-A subunit have been documented to have no
apparent increase in hemolysis [112]. Numerous studies
confirm that overexpression of LDH-A in various types of
cancer, and LDH-A inhibition in cancer cells could result
in significant stimulation of mitochondrial respiration,
decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and finally
lead to cancer cell death [113]. Interestingly, recent reports
also revealed a close association between the Warburg
effect and development of cancer drug resistance. Zhou’s
group studied a parental breast cancer cell line MDAMB-435 and reported a significant elevation of LDH-A
protein in taxol-resistant 435R1 and 435TRP cell lines.
Meanwhile, taxol treatment led to a dose-dependent
increase of LDH-A expression in MDA-MB-435 cells,
and LDH-A stability appeared to be elevated after taxol
administration, indicating that LDH-A might be biomarker
for detecting chemosensitivity [114]. In addition, LDH-A
silencing or the use of a glycolysis inhibitor oxamate
significantly re-sensitized the taxol-resistant cells to taxol
treatment. Notably, combination treatment with LDH-A
siRNA and oxamate increased sensitivity in taxol-resistant
cell viability compared with either agent alone [115].
Also, compared to gemcitabine-sensitive AsPC-1 cells,
gemcitabine-resistant cells Panc-1 and Pan-1GemR had more
mRNA for many glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase
II, glucose phosphate isomerase, 6-phosphofructo-2kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4, aldolase, pyruvate
kinase M2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3. Upon
exposure to glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor CG5, the proliferation of Panc-1 and Pan-1GemR was greatly
limited, and was accompanied with suppression of AktmTOR signaling, activation of amp-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), and suppressed expression of a series of
oncogenic proteins, such as cyclin D1, Sp1, and Skp2 [15].
Interestingly, glycolytic activity of tumor stromal cells
was also reported to contribute to cancer drug resistance.
Breast cancer MCF-7 cells are is preliminarily sensitive
to tamoxifen. However, when co-culturing breast cancer
cells MCF-7 with cancer-associated fibroblasts, MCF-7
cells gained resistance to tamoxifen. Mechanistic studies
indicated that glycolytic fibroblasts produced lactate that

CAV-1 AND WARBURG EFFECT
Cancer cells can be distinguished from normal
cells by several hallmarks; one is that cancer cells have
a fundamentally different bioenergetic metabolism
from non-neoplastic cells. In normal cells, energetic
metabolism mostly relies upon mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation, which consumes glucose that is finally
metabolized to carbon dioxide, water and ATP. In contrast,

was sufficient to provide nutrients to support cancer cell
survival [116]. Thus, the Warburg effect is correlated
to the development of chemoresistance and tumor
progression, and elucidation of key modulators involved in
the Warburg effect may offer strategies for treating cancer
drug resistance.
Considering the significance of Cav-1 in nutrient
delivery and cancer development, emerging studies
are underscoring the role of Cav-1 in regulating cancer
metabolism. Raikar’s group reported that Cav-1 affects
expression of glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase
and aldolase and that co-localization of Cav-1 and
phosphofructokinase or aldolase occurred throughout
A7r5 cells. Overexpression of Cav-1 shifted
phosphofructokinase and aldolase towards the plasma
membrane, indicating that Cav-1 may influence activity
and cellular distribution of glycolytic enzymes [117]. Also,
Cav-1 loss significantly downregulated glucose uptake,
intracellular ATP and lactate accumulation in colon cancer
cells, whereas Cav-1 overexpression increased glucose
uptake and ATP production by stimulating HMGA1medaited transcription of the glucose transporter SLC2A3/
GLUT3, which was reported to play a significant role in
the development of drug resistance [118]. Similar findings
were also observed in prostate cancer for which Cav1 overexpression significantly elevated glucose uptake

and lactate production, and this was accompanied with
upregulation of glucose transporter 3 and hexokinase 2.
However, these events did not alter enolase1, LDHA,
pyruvate kinase M2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
1 protein. Mechanistic studies indicated that Cav-1induced aerobic glycolysis was mediated through the AktmTORC1 pathway and independent of β-catenin signaling
[119]. Recently, evidence suggests a function for Cav-1
in tumor stroma. Immunohistochemical studies of human
breast cancer specimens revealed that biopsies lacking
stroma Cav-1 overexpressed key glycolytic enzymes,
such as PKM2 and LDH. Meanwhile, transcriptional
profiles of Cav-1-negative (-) tumor stroma revealed upregulation of 238 genes and downregulation of 232 genes
compared to Cav-1 positive (+) breast cancer stroma.
Notably, a significant gene upregulation of hypoxic target
genes (65 transcripts), glycolysis/pyruvate metabolism
(15 transcripts), and autophagy (22 transcripts) were
involved in the Cav-1-negative (-) tumor stroma [120].
In a Cav-1 knockout mice model, bone-marrow-derived
stroma cells upregulated both myofibroblast markers and
glycolytic enzymes [121]. Accelerated glycolytic activity
of stroma fibroblasts provided nutrients to support cancer
cell survival and growth—there was high expression
of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4, for lactate
extrusion) in cancer associated fibroblasts, whereas

Figure 3: Cav-1 may act as a stress-response signaling during cancer development in Cav-1 enriched cells. When Cav-

1 is maintained at the normalized level, it protects Cav-1 enriched normal cells from hazardous damage. However, when Cav-1 declines
below the threshold, cells will become sensitive to oncogenic stress and initiate malignant transformation. With cancer progression to the
advanced stage or is treated with cytotoxic agents, Cav-1 may re-overexpress to help cancer cells escape death, causing drug resistance and
metastasis.

adjacent breast cancer cells expressed MCT1 (for lactate
uptake), suggesting metabolic coupling occurred between
cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts [116]. Lactate secreted
from fibroblasts could be reabsorbed by cancer cells to
enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and be metabolized
into ATP and substrates for DNA or protein synthesis.
This hypothesis was validated by increased tumor growth
observed after co-injecting breast cancer cells and CL4
fibroblasts into nude mice cancer xenograft [122]. In
addition, several studies suggest that stromal Cav-1 loss
is an independent factor associated with poor clinical
prognosis of breast cancer patients, indicating that stromal
Cav-1 loss may assist cancer metastasis or drug resistance
[82, 123, 124]. Thus, the effects of Cav-1 on aerobic
glycolysis may be opposite in cancer cells and tumor
stroma. Combined targeted therapy should be considered
when designing novel treatment strategies based on Cav1 to overcome cancer metastasis or drug resistance. In
addition to direct silencing of Cav-1 to target cancer cells,
it is necessary to protect Cav-1 from downregulation in
tumor stroma. Thus, it is more prudent to combine Cav1-targeting agents with antibodies against tumor specific
antigens, such as EGFR, HER2, and mucins, etc. On
the other hand, combining Cav-1 silencing agents with
glycolysis inhibitors to prevent glycolytic activation in
tumor stroma may also avoid the risk of fueling cancer
cell growth.

potential targets for regulating chemosensitivity.
At present, genetic screens in yeast have identified a
large family of core autophagy-related genes (ATG), such
as Atg1, Atg4, LC3/Atg8, and BECN1 (Beclin-1) [131].
Moreover, mTOR also serves as the main regulator of
autophagy. Under nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, genomic
instability or other stress, mTOR suppression triggers the
autophagic cascade and inhibits cell proliferation [132].
Mechanistic work revealed that mTORC1 activation
can negatively regulate autophagy by phosphorylating
a complex of autophagic proteins such the Unc51-like
kinases (ULK1/2), which interfere with the formation of
autophagosomes [133]. Furthermore, as a central sensor
of cellular nutrient status or energy, AMPK is involved
in autophagic regulation and may serve as an upstream
regulator of mTORC1 [134]. AMPK activation can
subsequently trigger TSC2 to repress mTORC1 and
activate autophagy. In addition, research suggests that
AMPK may directly phosphorylate multiple sites in ULK1
(S317, S467, S555, T575, S637, and S777) and promote
ULK1 function in autophagy. Even with molecular
elucidation of autophagic regulation, more detailed
signaling networks await exploration.
Intriguingly, recent work indicates a potential
correlation between Cav-1 and autophagy. Lay reported
that in Cav-1 knockout adipocytes, autophagy marker
LC3-II/LC3-I ratios were significantly elevated and
this was validated in Cav-1 null mice using electron
microscopy and LC3II/LC3-I ratios in adipose tissue
[135]. Similar work confirmed that mammary pads of Cav1 null mice generated a lethal tumor microenvironment
and constitutively underwent autophagy by increased
oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines, which
provides recycled nutrients to feed cancer cells [136].
Shi’s group also demonstrated that Cav-1 deficiency could
induce autophagy via enhancing lysosomal function and
autophagosome-lysosome fusion in human breast cancer
cells [16]. A recent mechanistic study confirmed that
Cav-1 can directly interact with and regulate expression
of ATG12-ATG5, an ubiquitin-like conjugation system
crucial for autophagosome formation, in lung epithelial
Beas-2B cells [137]. Cav-1 deletion increased basal
and starvation-induced ATG12-ATG5 and autophagy,
whereas mutation of the Cav-1 binding motif on ATG12
disrupted this interaction and augmented autophagy [138].
Thus, Cav-1 loss may cause autophagic flux. Current
evidence also explains why Cav-1 expression is restored
in metastatic or drug-resistant cancer cells. Thus, Cav-1
re-expression can cause autophagy suppression, which
can inhibit lysosomal degradation of ABC transporters,
but also block autophagic cell death. Finally Cav-1
enriched cancer cells acquired drug-resistant properties
and stem-like characteristics [9, 14]. Although indirect
evidence indicates that Cav-1 is positively associated with
expression of ABC transporters and a population of stem
cells, the role of autophagy in mediating these molecular

CAV-1 AND AUTOPHAGY
Autophagy is emerging as a crucial response
to metabolic and therapeutic stresses, attempting to
maintain cellular homeostasis via eliminating excessive
or unnecessary proteins and damaged organelles through
lysosome degradation [125]. However, persistent stress
can promote extensive autophagy, inducing type II
programmed cell death. Increasing evidence suggests that
cytotoxic anti-cancer agents including other drugs, tyrosine
kinase inhibitors imatinib and cetuximab, tamoxifen and
cyclooxygenase inhibitors may induce autophagy in cell
culture and animal models [126]. Interestingly, autophagic
inhibition opposed camptothecin-induced cytotoxicity
in osteosarcoma, whereas autophagic induction by
roscovitine assisted cell killing by doxorubicin, indicating
that might become a novel strategy to enhance cancer
chemosensitivity [127, 128]. Additionally, autophagic
induction may overcome drug resistance during cancer
therapy. The constitutive expression of ABCB1 in
hepatocellular cancer cells was positively linked to Bcl2
and mTOR overexpression, rendering these cells resistant
to autophagy [129]. In contrast, autophagic induction by
vocamine activated autophagic cell death in doxorubicinresistant osteosarcoma cells, which was accompanied by
decreased ABCB1 expression [130]. Thus, autophagy is
important for regulation of cancer drug resistance and
molecules that can induce autophagic cell death may be

activation by Cav-1 silencing may be a novel strategy for
overcoming cancer drug resistance.

be understood by using conditional knockout models and
xenografts to study its precise role in carcinogenesis or
chemosensitization process in the future.
Taken together, an improved understanding of Cav1 regulation and its role in chemosensitivity modulation
is required to improve cancer prevention and therapy.
Drugs targeting Cav-1 are expected to be developed and
thereby provide powerful tools to explore Cav-1 molecular
biology. Furthermore, larger clinical studies are needed to
confirm the pathological significance of Cav-1 in cancer
onset and response to conventional therapy.

PERSPECTIVE
After drug treatment, cancer cells must activate
self-protection systems for survival. Cav-1, as a key
membrane-associated protein hub guiding signal
transduction and nutrient delivery, may be a first-line
response to chemotherapy. Studies indicate an elevation
of Cav-1 in cancer cells after chemotherapeutic exposure
[47]. Meanwhile, exogenous elevation or knockdown
of Cav-1 expression confirmed a critical role for Cav1 in mediating cancer chemosensitivity [9]. Other than
this drug-induced response, Cav-1 may be active after
radiotherapy, fluid shear stress, oxidative stress, high
osmolarity, and ultraviolet exposure [139, 140]. Therefore,
Cav-1 may be a stress-related molecule. Studies indicate
that Cav-1 is closely associated with stress signals such
as AMPK. Cav-1 silencing could induce autophagy in
an AMPK-dependent pathway. Additionally, the AMPK
activator metformin required Cav-1 to induce AMPK
phosphorylation and an AMP/ATP ratio increase in nonsmall-cell lung cancer [78, 141]. Notably, Cav-1-null
mice had lower body temperatures after fasting or fasting/
cold treatment and this was accompanied by a significant
reduction of AMPK expression [142]. Moreover, the
lifespan of Cav-1-null mice was reduced, indicating that a
stress-response for these mice may be weaker after Cav-1
knockout [143]. Therefore, Cav-1 might be a key stressrelated molecule protecting cells from hazardous stimulus.
This explains Cav-1’s behavior in cancer development.
During cancer initiation, malignant transformation may
be accelerated due to Cav-1 loss and this would sensitize
normal cells to oncogenic events. In contrast, when cancer
progress to later stage and is treated, expression of Cav1 would be upregulated to protect cancer cells escape
death by speeding aerobic glycolysis, increasing stem cell
populations or overexpressing ABC transporters (Figure
3) [46,144,145,146]. Nevertheless, this model may be
only restricted to Cav-1 enriched normal cells such as
mammary and lung epithelial cells. Since not all normal
cells express Cav-1 and not all cells with low/no Cav-1
expression are primary cancer cells, Cav-1 might be just
one of critical molecules responsible for assisting cells
defending harmful stress. Beside Cav-1, a number of
molecules including glucose regulated proteins (GRP78,
GRP94, GRP170) [147], some miRNAs (miRNA-25,
miRNA-30c, miRNA-23a, miRNA-200b, etc) [148]
or LncRNAs (UCA1, H19, MRUL, etc) [149], were
also recorded as stress-response targets. Therefore, the
value of Cav-1 as a diagnostic or therapeutic target to
improve chemoresistance is still needed to be validated
on independent cancer type. On the other hand, molecular
networks underlying Cav-1 and other stress signals must
