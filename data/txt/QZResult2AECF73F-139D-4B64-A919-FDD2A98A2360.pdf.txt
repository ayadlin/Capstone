ABSTRACT
This study explored combinational anticancer therapy using α-helical peptides
HPRP-A1/HPRP-A2 with the chemical drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and epirubicin
(EPI). The in vitro activity of these drugs against different cancer cell lines was
synergistically increased, as was their activity in a HeLa xenograft model in BALB/c
nude mice. We delineated the mechanism of this synergy by studying the apoptosis
pathway and morphologic changes in the HeLa cell membrane. The mechanism of the
HPRP-A1/DOX combination was found to involve enhanced apoptosis, which seemed
to be caspase-dependent and involved both the extrinsic and intrinsic parts of the
caspase cascade in HeLa cells. Combined application of HPRP-A1 and DOX at low
concentrations was significantly more effective than either drug alone against HeLa
tumors in the mouse xenograft model. This type of combination therapy appears to
have great clinical potential.

therapy, the effective cytotoxic doses of chemotherapeutic
drugs are dramatically reduced with a concomitant
decrease in adverse events, so this strategy represents a
superior approach to the use of single drugs [4, 9, 10].
Multi-component therapeutics with several compounds
that interact with diverse targets has become a renewed
research focus [11]. Currently, nearly all successful cancer
chemotherapy regimens are combinations of multiple
agents given simultaneously, thereby achieving better
therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects [9].
Many studies have shown that some synthetic
and natural cationic peptides exhibit anticancer activity,
including rapid cytotoxicity, a broad spectrum of activity
and high specificity for cancer cells [12, 13]. The clinical
anticancer potential of cationic peptides derives from
their targeting of the cytoplasmic membrane, allowing
them to bypass the cellular mechanisms of multidrug
resistance and produce membrane lysis or increased
permeabilization [14, 15]. Some cationic peptides (such
as defensins and cecropins) not only induce cell death
(by increasing membrane permeability leading to cell
lysis and/or changes in membrane barrier function)
but also have the potential to enhance the efficacy of
different chemotherapeutics against multidrug-resistant

INTRODUCTION
Although breakthroughs in tumor treatment are
frequently reported, severe toxicity in normal cells and
low efficacy against multidrug-resistant cancer cells still
preclude the successful development of new conventional
anticancer drugs for clinical use [1, 2]. However, to
overcome adverse drug reaction, novel approaches
for cancer therapy are urgently required. Doxorubicin
(DOX) and epirubicin (EPI) are stereoisomers with a
broad spectrum of antitumor activity and are taken up
by tumor cells through slow passive diffusion across the
plasma membrane. However, DOX has a disappointing
30% overall response rate, which is a major factor in
limiting its uptake into tumor cells [3, 4]. There has been
much research interest into the design of nanocarriers
and hydrophilic peptide conjugants for anticancer drugs
[5, 6]. However, these carriers often have limited drug
loading capacity and are thus unlikely provide a significant
clinical improvement [7]. Sugahara et al. showed that
co-administration of iRGD (a tumor-penetrating peptide)
with different types of cancer drugs was slightly more
effective than the conjugated drug at inhibiting tumor
growth and tumor accumulation [8]. In combination

tumor cells [16]. Furthermore, some cationic peptides are
highly specific towards tumor cells rather than normal
cells [17–19]. Hence, these cationic peptides may be
an important complementary adjunct to conventional
chemotherapeutics.
In this study, we hypothesized that cell membrane
disruption by α-helical anticancer peptides should
increase the intracellular concentration of a conventional
chemotherapeutic agent given simultaneously, thus
enhancing its anticancer effect. We systematically
studied the synergistic effect between α-helical peptides
and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. HPRP-A1
and its enantiomer HPRP-A2 consist of 15 all-L- or
all-D-amino acids, respectively. These peptides were
employed together with DOX and EPI to investigate their
combined efficacy in vitro and in vivo and to delineate the
mechanism of their synergistic action. The objectives of
this study were three-fold: first, to explore the combined
anticancer activity of peptides and chemotherapeutic
drugs; second, to understand the synergistic mechanism

of these two types of anticancer agents; and third, to verify
the clinical potential of this new high efficacy, low toxicity
approach to cancer chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Peptides and anticancer activity
As shown in Fig. 1, peptide HPRP-A1 is a 15-residue
α-helical amphipathic membrane-active peptide. Compared
with the N-terminus of ribosomal protein L1 (RpL1)
of Helicobacter pylori, HPRP-A1 shows more than
86% homology in amino acid sequence and forms an
amphipathic α-helical structure in the hydrophobic
environment with complete polar and non-polar faces
[20]. Composed of all D-amino acids, HPRP-A2 is the
enantiomer of HPRP-A1. HPRP-A1/HPRP-A2 showed
strong anticancer activity and low toxicity against human
red blood cells (Table 1). Although the anticancer efficacy
of the peptides was inferior to that of the chemical drugs,

their greater molecular weight facilitated much faster
cytotoxicity, indicating that their mechanism of action
was different to the chemical drugs. Similar IC50 values
between the two enantiomeric peptides indicated that there
was no stereochemical effect in the anticancer action of
HPRP-A1/HPRP-A2. The all-D peptide has comparable
anticancer activity to the all-L analog, indicating that these
two α-helical peptides do not act through interaction with
a chiral center, such as a receptor or enzyme.

the chemical drugs had similar anticancer activity in
combination with both peptide stereoisomers (HPRP-A1/
HPRP-A2 or DOX/EPI), we used only HPRP-A1 and
DOX in subsequent experiments.

Combination with HPRP-A1 enhanced cellular
uptake of DOX
Time-dependent intracellular accumulation of DOX
fluorescence was detected by fluorescence microscopy and
by flow cytometry using HeLa cells. As clearly shown in
Fig. 3A, intracellular DOX fluorescence (red) was more
intense in cells incubated with a combination of HPRP-A1
and DOX than with DOX alone after incubation for 1 h and
3 h, respectively. These findings were further confirmed by
flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). As expected, the flow cytometric
histogram of the cells incubated with HPRP-A1+DOX
revealed higher fluorescence intensity than with DOX
alone after incubation at all measured time points (2, 4, 6
and 24 h). The corresponding flow cytometric quantitative
comparison of fluorescence intensity in Geomean at these
different incubations showed a similar trend, namely that
combining HPRP-A1 and DOX enhances cellular uptake
of DOX compared with DOX alone (Fig. 3C).
The mechanism of drug uptake into cells was further
analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. As showed
in Fig. 3D, untreated HeLa cells exhibited an adherent
smooth surface. In contrast, pores are visible on the surface
of cells after treatment with a combination of HPRP-A1/
DOX. Furthermore, while treatment with HPRP-A1 or
DOX alone caused a small effect on the integrity of the
cell membrane, combination therapy resulted in a severely
disrupted cell membrane with significant cavity formation
and loss of microvilli and membrane integrity.

Co-treatment induces HeLa/HepG2 cell
death in vitro
Two well-studied cell lines (HeLa and HepG2)
were selected to study whether low-dose drug
combinations produces synergistic effects on cell growth
in vitro. Cells were treated with HPRP-A1/HPRP-A2
alone (16, 12 and 8 μg/ml), DOX/EPI alone (1.2, 0.8
and 0.4 μg/ml) and various peptide-drug combinations
(HPRP-A1/DOX, HPRP-A1/EPI, HPRP-A2/DOX and
HPRP-A2/EPI) for 24 h. MTT assays were used to
evaluate the effects of these combinations on cell growth.
The drug concentrations used were selected based on the
IC50 values of each drug alone (Table 1). At sub-threshold
doses, there was no distinct cytotoxicity or growth
reduction when used alone. However, these same drug
doses used in the peptide-drug combinations (HPRP-A1/
DOX, HPRP-A1/EPI, HPRP-A2/DOX, and HPRP-A2/
EPI) produced significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1). According to the Jin’s formula
[21], all Q (combination index) values were >1.15, which
indicates that there were significant synergistic effects
between the α-helical peptides and the conventional
anticancer drugs in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). Because

apoptosis population observed after the treatment with the
combination therapy (Fig. 4A & 4B).

To investigate the effect of combination therapy on
cell apoptosis, HeLa cells were incubated with HPRP-A1,
DOX or HPRP-A1+DOX for 24 h. Flow cytometric
analysis of Annexin V/PI staining of cells treated with
HPRP-A1+DOX at IC10 concentrations (HPRP-A1
12 μg/ml, DOX 0.8 μg/ml) revealed synergistically (rather
than summatively) increased early apoptosis (45.70%)
compared with each compound alone (HPRP-A1: 9.27%;
DOX: 6.71%) (Fig. 4A). The synergistic trend was also
apparent at IC20 concentrations (HPRP-A1 16 μg/ml, DOX
1.2 μg/ml), where the combination treatment resulted
in 56.29% of cells being in the early apoptosis phase
compared with only 19.86% and 26.40%, respectively,
with HPRP-A1 and DOX treatment alone. The activities of
caspase-3, -8 and -9 were tested using the corresponding
caspase activity detection kits, and Fig. 4B shows that
these enzymes were minimally activated by each agent
alone but were strongly activated by the combination
therapy.

HPRP-A1/DOX combination inhibits HeLa cell
growth in vivo
To evaluate this synergistic antitumor action in vivo,
mice were inoculated with HeLa cells (1 × 106 in 100 μl
PBS) subcutaneously into the right armpit. After tumors
had grown to about 200 mm3 (~10 days), the animals were
divided into four groups such that weight and tumor-size
differences among the groups were minimized. In the next
15 days, the animals were given DOX (1 mg/kg weight,
based on the minimum side effects [4]) and/or HPRP-A1
(10 mg/kg weight, based on the IC50 ratio of HPRP-A1/
DOX) once every two days by direct injection into the
tumors. PBS was given as the control. After this time (25
days total), mice were sacrificed and the tumors collected.
Fig. 5A and 5B reveals marked differences in tumor
volume at the end of the experiment. Tumor volumes in
the combination group (395.40 mm3) were significantly
smaller than those in the control (870.86 mm3), HPRP-A1
alone (771.29 mm3) and DOX alone (597.17 mm3)
groups. Fig. 5C shows that the average tumor weight in
the combination group was lower than in the control,
HPRP-A1, and DOX groups (0.32 g vs. 0.69 g, 0.66 g,
and 0.39 g, respectively). Fig. 5D clearly shows that
mice treated with the combination therapy experience
much greater tumor growth inhibition (54.60%) than
animals treated with DOX alone (31.43%) or HPRP-A1
alone (11.43%). There was no obvious body weight

Cell cycle analysis
HPRP-A1 and DOX trigger G0/G1 and G2/M arrest

in Fig. 4C, HeLa cells treated with the two drugs together
for 24 h resulted in an increase in sub-G1 arrest (64.82%
compared with 4.07% in DOX) and in G2/M arrest
(29.80% compared with 10.42% in DOX). These findings
also strengthened the increased caspase-3 activity and cell

and DOX produces significant antitumor effects in vivo.

chemical drugs in passing the cytoplasmic membrane, thus
concentrating them within their intracellular targets.
In the in vitro and in vivo study, we have
demonstrated that co-application of HPRP-A1
or HPRP-A2 with either DOX or EPI produces
synergistically increased growth inhibition of HeLa and
HepG2 cancer cells by enhancing apoptosis. All Q values
were >1.15, which indicates the synergy of combined
therapy in vitro. Our data further suggested that the
HPRP-A1 enhancement of DOX-mediated apoptosis
appeared to be caspase-dependent and involved both the
extrinsic and intrinsic parts of the caspase cascade in HeLa
cells. Through cell cycle analysis and flow cytometry,
we also showed that cell apoptosis was correlated with
the induction of cell cycle arrest in G2/M, as it is when
using DOX alone. We also used a HeLa mouse xenograft
model to produce in vivo confirmation that the HPRP-A1/
DOX combination has synergistically higher antitumor

DISCUSSION
HPRP-A1 and HPRP-A2 are amphipathic α-helical
peptides with potent antimicrobial activity against various
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and negligible
hemolytic activity against human red blood cells [20].
Here, these peptides have been demonstrated to possess
significant anticancer activity in two cancer cell lines.
These α-helical membrane-active peptides disrupt the
target cell membrane by a necrotic mechanism at high
concentrations [22]. However, we have demonstrated
here that, at lower concentrations, they induce target
cell apoptosis. In addition, these peptides assist other

activity than HPRP-A1 and DOX used alone, validating
the clinical potential of this combined therapy.
It is interesting to see that, compared with DOX
alone, the volume of tumor treated by HPRP/DOX
decreased significantly, while the weight of tumor did
not change as much as the tumor volume (Fig. 5B and
5C). This phenomenon may be attribute to the fact that
cell apoptosis can readily decrease the volume of the cell
but not the weight, since one of the characteristics of cell
apoptosis is apoptotic shrinkage and detachment of cells
[23] and cells are not totally degraded at this time. Hence,
the changes of the tumor volume are greater than those
of the tumor weight. The tumors from mice treated with
HPRP-A1+DOX had more apoptotic cells than those from
mice treated with control, HPRP-A1 alone or DOX alone
(Fig. 5F). Moreover, H&E staining of tumor sections also
demonstrated the superior efficacy of the combination
therapy in inhibiting tumor proliferation (Fig. 5F). Our
previous study showed that α-helical membrane-active
peptides produce pores or channels in eukaryotic cell
membranes and bind quickly to the surface of HeLa cells
via a strong electrostatic interaction [22]. This previous
study concluded that the sole target of HPRP-A1 was
the cytoplasmic membrane because it exhibits a broad
spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal activities [20].
Normal cell membranes, such as those in red blood cells,
are characterized by zwitterionic phospholipids. By
contrast, cancer cells have more anionic phospholipids in
their outer leaflet, much like prokaryotic cell membranes
[24–26]. In addition, many cancer cell membranes contain
O-glycosylated mucin, a type of glycoprotein which
increases the negative charge on the cancer cell surface
[27]. The resultant increase in electrostatic interaction
between cationic anticancer peptides and the negativelycharged cancer cell surface, together with the selectivity
of these peptides for cancer cell membrane components,
contributes to their high selectivity for cancer cells over
healthy eukaryotic cells [12, 19]. In addition, there is a
higher number of microvilli on cancer cells than normal
cells [28], which increases the membrane surface area
and thus the concentration of bound peptide on the cancer
cell surface [24, 29]. This study thus confirms that the
HPRP-A1/HPRP-A2 target is the cancer cell membrane,
in stark contrast to the mechanism of DOX anticancer
activity which is believed to involve DNA damage
through topoisomerase II inhibition and free radical
generation via a redox reaction [30, 31]. The therapeutic
efficacy of many anticancer drugs is limited by their poor
penetration into tumor tissue, which limits the doses of
drugs that can be safely administered to cancer patients,
leading to reduced efficacy and the development of drug
resistance. A study on mouse tumor models shows that
a previously characterized tumor-penetrating peptide,
iRGD, increased vascular and tissue permeability in a
tumor-specific manner, allowing coadministered drugs
to penetrate into extravascular tumor tissue. Systemic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

injection with iRGD improved the therapeutic index of
drugs of various compositions, including a small molecule
doxorubicin [8]. We believe, in this study, the HPRP-A1
and HPRP-A2 increase the membrane permeability and
allow DOX/EPI to penetrate into tumor cells like iRGD;
moreover, the peptides can cause the death of tumor cells
simultaneously, which is superior to iRGD.
The synergy shown here permits the use of relatively
low concentrations of peptides and drugs (<IC20) to
achieve significant anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.
This dose reduction minimizes drug effects on normal
cells, enabling an effective apoptosis-mediated anticancer
effect without inducing harmful adverse events. In
addition, because HPRP-A1 and HPRP-A2 were equally
effective at potentiating the effects of DOX/EPI, we are
confident that the synergy does not depend on the stereoisomeric structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptides
α-Helical peptides HPRP-A1 and HPRP-A2
(peptide sequence Ac-FKKLKKLFSKLWNWK-amide,
consisting of all L- or all D-amino acids, respectively)
were synthesized by solid-phase methods using Fmoc
(9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described
previously [20] and purified (>95% purity) by RP-HPLC.
Further characterization was by mass spectrometry
and amino acid analysis. Doxorubicin hydrochloride
(DOX·HCl) and epirubicin hydrochloride (EPI·HCl) were
purchased from Meilun Biology Technology Co., Ltd.
(Dalian, China).

Cell culture
Human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) and human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) cells obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection which
authenticates the cell lines by short-tandem repeat DNA
testing, were used within 6 months of resuscitation and
grown in DMEM with fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10% v/v),
penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml) in a
humid atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Cell viability assay
HepG2 and HeLa cells (8 × 103) were plated in
triplicate in a 96-well microtiter plate. Complete medium
was replaced after 24 h with 100 μl of fresh medium
containing various concentrations of drugs. After a further
24 h, cells were incubated with MTT at 37°C for 4 h.
Thereafter DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan
crystals and the absorbance at 492 nm was measured
with a microplate reader (GF-M3000; Gaomi Caihong
Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd. Shandong, China). Jin’s
1775

formula was used to further quantify the synergistic effect
of the combination treatment of HPRP-A1 and DOX.
The formula is: Q = Ea+b / (Ea + Eb ˗ Ea × Eb), where
Q is the combination index; Ea + b represents the cell
proliferative inhibition rate of the combined drug; Ea and
Eb are signs of the cell proliferative inhibition rate of each
drug. After calculation: Q < 0.85, Q > 1.15 and 0.85 <
Q < 1.15 indicate antagonism, synergy, and additive effect,
respectively.

HeLa cells were seeded in a 24-well plate with
sterilized cover slips and incubated overnight. HPRP-A1
and/or DOX (IC20 concentrations) were added the
following day and the plate was incubated at 37°C for
24 h. Preparation of cells for electron microscopy was
performed as described previously [22] and cells were
analyzed using an S3400 scanning electron microscope
(Hitachi, Japan).

Hemolytic activity

Apoptosis assay

Peptide or drug samples were serially diluted
in PBS in round-bottomed 96-well plates to give a
volume of 70 μl sample solution in each well. Human
erythrocytes anticoagulated with EDTA were collected
by centrifugation (1000 × g) for 5 min, washed twice
with PBS, then diluted to a concentration of 2% in PBS.
Erythrocytes (70 μl of 2% suspension) were added to
each well to give a final concentration of 1% human
erythrocytes in each well, and plates were incubated
at 37°C for 1.5 h. The plates were then centrifuged for
10 min at 3000 rpm and the supernatant (90 μl)
transferred to a flat-bottomed 96-well plate. The release of
hemoglobin was determined by measuring the absorbance
of the supernatant at 540 nm. Hemolytic activity was
determined as the minimal peptide concentration to cause
hemolysis. Erythrocytes in PBS and distilled water were
used as negative (0%) and positive (100%) hemolysis
controls, respectively.

Apoptosis of HeLa cells was detected using
the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD
Biosciences). HeLa Cells (1 × 106) were seeded in 6-well
plates for 24 h. After induction with HPRP-A1 or/and
DOX (IC10 and IC20 concentrations, respectively) for 24
h, the cells were collected. Subsequent procedures were
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
AnnexinV-FITC apoptosis detection was by flow
cytometry. Activity of caspase-3, -8 and -9 was tested
using the corresponding caspase activity detection kits
(BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturers’
instructions.

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle arrest was studied using flow cytometry.
HeLa Cells (1 × 106) were cultivated in 6-well plates
containing 2 ml media and allowed to attach overnight
at 37°C. Medium (2 ml) containing HPRP-A1 (12 μg/
ml) and/or DOX (0.8 μg/ml) was then added to each
well. Medium alone was used as a negative control. After
incubation for 24 h, cell cycle distribution was determined
by a FACScan cytometer and Cell Quest software
(FACSCalibur, Becton-Dickinson). All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Flow cytometric analyses
HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were seeded in sixwell plates. DOX (1.0 μg/ml) or/and HPRP-A1 (12 μg/ml)
were then added to each well. After incubation, the cells
were collected at different time intervals (2, 4, 6 and 24 h)
for measurement of doxorubicin fluorescence using flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton-Dickinson, San Jose,
CA, USA).

Mouse tumor xenograft model
Six-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (obtained
from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. China)
were housed in appropriate animal care facilities during
the experimental period, and were handled in accordance
with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
in China. All animals were inoculated subcutaneously
into the right armpit with 1 × 106 HeLa cells in 100 μl
PBS. After tumors had grown to about 200 mm3 (~10 d),
the animals were divided into four groups such that
weight and tumor-size differences between groups were
minimized. Over the next 15 d, HPRP-A1 (10 mg/kg
body weight) and/or DOX (1 mg/kg body weight) were
given once every two days by direct injection into the
tumors. Mice treated with PBS were used as controls

Fluorescence microscopy
Cells were treated with DOX and/or HPRP-A1
for different time intervals (1 and 3 h) at a final DOX
concentration of 15 μg/ml in basal DMEM. Untreated
cells were used as a control. Cells in a 6-well plate
were harvested, and washed three times with PBS
before being fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol for
5 min at 4°C. Cell nuclei were then stained with 4,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindile (DAPI, blue) for 30 min
at room temperature. Images of cells were obtained by
fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Japan). All images
are at 400× magnification.

(Supplementary Fig. S2). Tumor volumes [(major axis)
× (minor axis)2 × 1/2] were measured at defined time
periods. The inhibition rate of tumor growth (%) was
calculated using the following formula: (tumor volume of
control - tumor volume of experiment)/tumor volume of
control × 100%. Mice were sacrificed and the tumors were
collected for further immunohistochemistry and TUNEL
assays.
