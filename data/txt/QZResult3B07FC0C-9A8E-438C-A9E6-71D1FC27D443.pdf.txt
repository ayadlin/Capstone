Abstract

Author Manuscript

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells harboring activating mutations of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) tend to display elevated activity of several survival signaling pathways.
Surprisingly, these mutations also correlate with reduced phosphorylation of ERK and SHP2, a
protein tyrosine phosphatase required for complete ERK activation downstream of most receptor
tyrosine kinases. Since ERK activity influences cellular response to EGFR inhibition, altered
SHP2 function could play a role in the striking response to gefitinib witnessed with EGFR
mutation. Here, we demonstrate that impaired SHP2 phosphorylation correlates with diminished
SHP2 function in NSCLC cells expressing mutant, versus wild-type, EGFR. In NSCLC cells
expressing wild-type EGFR, SHP2 knockdown decreased ERK phosphorylation, basally and in
response to gefitinib, and increased cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. In cells expressing EGFR
mutants, these effects of SHP2 knockdown were less substantial, but expression of constitutively
active SHP2 reduced cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. In cells expressing EGFR mutants, which do
not undergo efficient ligand-mediated endocytosis, SHP2 was basally associated with GAB1 and
EGFR, and SHP2′s presence in membrane fractions was dependent on EGFR activity. Whereas
EGF promoted a more uniform intracellular distribution of initially centrally localized SHP2 in
cells expressing wild-type EGFR, SHP2 was basally evenly distributed and did not redistribute in
response to EGF in cells with EGFR mutation. Thus, EGFR mutation may promote association of
a fraction of SHP2 at the plasma membrane with adapters which promote SHP2 activity.
Consistent with this, SHP2 immunoprecipitated from cells with EGFR mutation was active, and

EGF treatment did not change this activity. Overall, our data suggest that a fraction of SHP2 is
sequestered at the plasma membrane in cells with EGFR mutation in a way that impedes SHP2′s
ability to promote ERK activity and identify SHP2 as a potential target for co-inhibition with
EGFR in NSCLC.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tumor response to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and
erlotinib is generally limited to the 10-20% of NSCLCs carrying kinase-activating EGFR
mutations.1-3 NSCLC cells harboring these mutations often display elevated
phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5
(STAT3/5), ERBB3, and MET.2,4-6 Recently, it was shown that these EGFR mutations also
surprisingly result in impaired EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of both ERK, an important
determinant of cell response to gefitinib, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2,7 which
is required for complete ERK activation by most receptor tyrosine kinases.8 Thus, the
striking responsiveness of tumors with EGFR mutation to EGFR inhibition may result from
an imbalance in EGFR oncogenic signaling wherein activating mutations promote some
signaling pathways while simultaneously impairing others.

Author Manuscript

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, results in SHP2 phosphorylation at
Y542, which is required for normal SHP2-mediated ERK activation in response to many
growth factors.9 Receptor activation and phosphorylation also results in SHP2 recruitment to
receptors via direct binding or through adapters, which activates SHP2 through relief of
auto-inhibitory intramolecular interactions.8 SHP2 is recruited to EGFR through binding to
phosphorylated adapter proteins including GRB2-associated binder 1 (GAB1),10 whose
association with EGFR is mediated by GRB2 upon EGFR phosphorylation at Y1068 and
Y1086.11 Downstream of EGFR, SHP2 is primarily associated with promoting ERK activity
by regulating RAS.12 SHP2-activating mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome,
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia.13,14 SHP2-activating
mutations have also been found in lung cancer, although the consequences of these
mutations are not fully understood.15

Author Manuscript

The aforementioned differences in SHP2 and ERK phosphorylation in NSCLC cells with
EGFR mutation suggest SHP2 function may be perturbed in this setting. However, the role
of SHP2 in NSCLC has not been thoroughly evaluated. In previous studies, HeLa cells
expressing dominant-negative dynamin,16 a GTPase required for clathrin-mediated EGFR
endocytosis, displayed diminished EGF-mediated phosphorylation of SHP2 and ERK.7
Since the EGFR-activating mutations observed in NSCLC result in impaired EGFR
endocytosis,7,17 differential EGFR trafficking may explain the defects in SHP2 and ERK
phosphorylation in NSCLC cells expressing EGFR mutants. SHP2 localization could also be

altered in the context of EGFR mutation via association with internalization-impaired
EGFR.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we find diminished SHP2 function in NSCLC cells expressing mutant versus
wild-type EGFR. In cells expressing wild-type EGFR, SHP2 knockdown reduced ERK
phosphorylation and increased cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. In cells expressing EGFR
mutants, the effects of SHP2 knockdown were less pronounced, but expression of
constitutively active SHP2 reduced cellular sensitivity to gefitinib. In cells expressing EGFR
mutants, SHP2 was basally associated with GAB1 and EGFR, and the presence of SHP2 in
membrane fractions was dependent on EGFR activity. In cells expressing wild-type EGFR,
EGF promoted redistribution of initially centrally localized SHP2, but SHP2 was basally
evenly distributed and did not redistribute in response to EGF in cells expressing EGFR
mutants. SHP2 was catalytically active in cells expressing EGFR mutants, consistent with
the finding that SHP2 association with adapters was not impaired, but rather basally
elevated, in these cells. Overall, our data suggest that a fraction of SHP2 is sequestered at
the plasma membrane in cells with EGFR mutation in a way that interferes with SHP2mediated ERK activation and promotes cellular sensitivity to EGFR inhibition.

Results
Effects of SHP2 knockdown on ERK phosphorylation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To assess the signaling role of SHP2 in NSCLC cells, we examined the effects of SHP2
knockdown on ERK phosphorylation in response to gefitinib in a panel of cell lines (Figure
1 and Supplementary Figure S1). In H322 and H292 cells (EGFRWT), SHP2 knockdown
reduced ERK phosphorylation in untreated cells by more than 90%. In H1666 and H1781
cells (EGFRWT), SHP2 knockdown resulted in notable, but more modest, reductions in
baseline ERK phosphorylation of ∼60% and 20%, respectively, as well as reductions in the
gefitinib IC50 values for ERK phosphorylation. In H3255 cells (EGFRL858R), which display
impaired EGF-mediated SHP2 phosphorylation relative to cells expressing wild-type EGFR
(7; Supplementary Figure S2), SHP2 knockdown had no substantial effect on ERK
phosphorylation at any concentration of gefitinib. In HCC827 cells (EGFRdelE746-A750),
which also display impaired SHP2 phosphorylation (7; Supplementary Figure S2), there was
a reduction in baseline ERK phosphorylation with SHP2 knockdown compared to controls,
but the effect was less substantial than that observed in cells expressing wild-type EGFR,
other than H1781. There was also no enhancement in gefitinib's ability to inhibit ERK
phosphorylation in SHP2-depleted HCC827 cells relative to controls. Relative to ERK
phosphorylation, SHP2 knockdown produced smaller changes in AKT and STAT3
phosphorylation in H1666 and H292 cells (Supplementary Figure S3).
Effects of SHP2 knockdown on cellular response to gefitinib
In H322 and H1666 cells, SHP2 knockdown reduced gefitinib IC50 values for cell
proliferation by 15- and 3-fold, respectively (Figure 2). In H1781 cells, a gefitinib-resistant
cell line, the IC50 was reduced from > 10 μM to 2.55 μM. SHP2-depleted H292 cells were
only modestly sensitized to gefitinib but were significantly growth inhibited in the absence
of gefitinib (Supplementary Figure S4a). Thus, gefitinib may have been unable to enhance

the already striking effects of SHP2 knockdown on H292 proliferation. In contrast, H3255
cells showed virtually no effect of SHP2 knockdown on sensitivity to gefitinib (Figure 2e).
HCC827 cells displayed a small shift in sensitivity to gefitinib in response to SHP2
knockdown (Figure 2f), but we measured no proliferative effect in the absence of gefitinib
(Supplementary Figure S4b).
To ensure the measured effects were specific for SHP2, we knocked down SHP2 in a
representative cell line expressing wild-type EGFR using an independent hairpin targeting
the 3′ untranslated region of SHP2 and reconstituted cells with SHP2WT or SHP2Y542F
(Figure 3). As before, SHP2-depleted cells displayed impaired ERK phosphorylation and
enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib. These effects were partially rescued by reconstitution with
SHP2WT or SHP2Y542F.

SHP2 association with GAB1 and EGFR and subcellular compartmentalization

Author Manuscript

To investigate the mechanism underlying apparent differential SHP2 function in cells with
or without EGFR mutation, we examined SHP2 association with GAB1 and EGFR. In
H3255 and HCC827 cells, SHP2 was basally associated with GAB1 and phosphorylated
EGFR to a significantly greater degree than in either H322 or H1666 cells (Figure 4a). In
H3255 cells, these associations were diminished by gefitinib (Figure 4b). EGF enhanced
SHP2 association with GAB1 and EGFR in all cell lines, but the fold increases in
association were generally smaller in H3255 and HCC827 cells (Figure 4a). Since EGFR
mutants fail to undergo efficient EGF-mediated endocytosis,7,17 we interpreted these
findings as indicating that a fraction of SHP2 was sequestered at the plasma membrane in
cells with EGFR mutation. To further substantiate this, we analyzed SHP2′s distribution in a
subset of these cells by subcellular fractionation. In H1666 and H3255 cells, the majority of
SHP2 was cytosolic. Only in H3255 cells, however, did gefitinib reduce SHP2 levels in
crude membrane fractions, suggesting that SHP2 was membrane-localized in an EGFRdependent manner (Figure 4c). The EGFR activity-independent presence of SHP2 in H1666
membrane fractions could be explained by SHP2 localization to membrane compartments
which settle with plasma membrane in the crude membrane fraction generated by our
protocol. This possibility is suggested by previous studies.18
Intracellular distribution of SHP2

Author Manuscript

We further examined EGF's ability to alter the intracellular distribution of SHP2 in H1666
and H3255 cells by immunofluorescence. In H1666 cells, the distribution shifted from one
where SHP2 was concentrated around the cell center to one where some SHP2 moved
toward the cell periphery and SHP2 was distributed more uniformly (Figure 5). Similar
changes were noted by confocal microscopy, including movement of SHP2 to membrane
ruffles (Supplementary Figure S5). EGF also caused the formation of EGFR- and RAB5positive endocytic vesicles in H1666 cells (Supplementary Figure S6). In H3255 cells, SHP2
was basally uniformly distributed. EGF did not alter this distribution or generate endocytic
vesicles (Figure 5; Supplementary Figures S5 and S6), consistent with previous reports of
impaired EGFR internalization in these cells.

Role of GAB1 in SHP2 localization and EGF-mediated effects

Author Manuscript

GAB1 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S7a) did not alter basal association of SHP2 with
Y1068-phosphorylated EGFR in H3255 cells (Figure 6a), nor did it alter SHP2′s
intracellular distribution in either H1666 or H3255 cells (Supplementary Figure S7b),
suggesting that recruitment of SHP2 to EGFR and the cell periphery can be accomplished
independent of GAB1 binding, potentially through GAB2. GAB1 knockdown did, however,
diminish EGF-mediated ERK and SHP2 phosphorylation, reduce ERK and AKT
phosphorylation in response to gefitinib, and increase cellular sensitivity to gefitinib in
H1666 cells (Figures 6b-d and Supplementary Figure S7c-d). Although GAB1-depleted
H3255 cells displayed a modest reduction in SHP2 phosphorylation, there was no effect on
ERK phosphorylation (Figure 6b), suggesting that the mechanism by which SHP2 function
is impaired in these cells may simultaneously perturb GAB1 function.

SHP2 activity

Author Manuscript

Effects of SHP2 mutation

SHP2 knockdown in H1666 and H3255 cells resulted in fractional reductions of measured
phosphatase activities comparable to the reductions in immunoprecipitated SHP2 levels
(Figure 7a), indicating that SHP2 was active in both cell lines. In response to EGF, SHP2
activity increased in H1666 cells, with p = 0.08 for this comparison (Figure 7b). EGF
elicited no change in SHP2 activity in H3255 cells (p = 0.50). Note that comparison of
activity between cell lines is not straightforward because more SHP2 was
immunoprecipitated from H3255 lysates, lysates were not controlled for cell numbers due to
proliferation differences, and only a fraction of SHP2 was adapter-bound in each cell line.
Thus, the lower apparent normalized SHP2 activity in H3255 versus H1666 cells may not
necessarily reflect a lower total SHP2 activity level on a per cell basis.

Author Manuscript

In H1666 cells, expression of constitutively active SHP2D61A or SHP2E76A mitigated
gefitinib-mediated reductions in ERK phosphorylation, and expression of catalyticallyinactive SHP2C459S reduced ERK phosphorylation basally and in response to gefitinib
(Figure 8a). Despite increased ERK phosphorylation in H1666 cells expressing SHP2D61A
or SHP2E76A, there was no change in gefitinib sensitivity in these cells (Figure 8b),
suggesting that the parental cell line's capacity to activate ERK was at a threshold level for
maintaining cell survival. However, H1666 cells expressing SHP2C459S were more
responsive to gefitinib, mirroring the effects of SHP2 knockdown. In H3255 cells,
expression of SHP2E76A augmented ERK phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib and
substantially decreased cellular sensitivity to gefitinib (Figure 8c and d). As expected,
SHP2C459S expression had little effect on ERK phosphorylation or gefitinib response in
H3255s.
Importance of SHP2-mediated effects downstream of MET
Since SHP2-GAB1 association is required for sustained ERK activation downstream of
MET,19 we hypothesized that SHP2 could play a role in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)mediated resistance to EGFR inhibition in NSCLC cells by maintaining GAB1-mediated
signaling in the presence of gefitinib.20,21 To explore this idea, we treated SHP2-depleted

H1666 and HCC827 cells with gefitinib in the presence or absence of HGF. Although HGF
sustained phosphorylated GAB1 Y627, a SHP2 binding site, in the presence of gefitinib,
SHP2 knockdown did not affect HGF-mediated rescue of ERK phosphorylation in either
cell line (Supplementary Figure S8).

Discussion
Magnitudes of SHP2-mediated effects

Author Manuscript

Other than in H292 cells, where SHP2 knockdown substantially inhibited cell growth, SHP2
depletion in cells expressing wild-type EGFR increased sensitivity to gefitinib by 3- to 15fold, as measured by XTT assay. Gefitinib IC50 values for cells expressing wild-type or
mutant EGFR typically differ by a factor of ten or more.22 Thus, SHP2 depletion in cells
expressing wild-type EGFR generally produced an effect consistent with differences on the
lower end of what is observed among NSCLC cells with or without EGFR mutation. Of
course, other factors contribute to differences in NSCLC cellular sensitivity to gefitinib,
including differential regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and
STAT3/5.2,4,5 Our study appears to be the first, however, to identify a mechanism wherein a
survival signaling pathway is impaired by EGFR-activating mutations in a way which
impacts cellular response to EGFR inhibition.

Author Manuscript

We also found that SHP2 depletion most strongly impaired ERK phosphorylation in cells
expressing wild-type versus mutant EGFR. However, H1781 (EGFRWT) cells were an
outlier in terms of the relatively modest effect of SHP2 knockdown on ERK
phosphorylation. Despite this, there was a substantial effect of SHP2 knockdown on cellular
response to gefitinib. H1781 cells express a constitutively active HER2 mutant (VC
insertion at G776) and are dependent on HER2 for ERK and AKT phosphorylation.23 Since
HER2 can sequester EGFR at the plasma membrane,24,25 the possibility exists for SHP2 to
be sequestered with EGFR in these cells as well. Indeed, this appeared to occur
(Supplementary Figure S9). However, as SHP2 promotes RAS activity downstream of
HER2,26 HER2-mediated SHP2 function may contribute to the modest effect of SHP2
knockdown on ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Further studies are needed to parse the
effects of SHP2 downstream of EGFR and HER2 in these cells.
Differential roles of SHP2 and GAB1

Author Manuscript

A previous study demonstrated impaired SHP2 phosphorylation in NSCLC cells expressing
EGFR mutants,7 but the phenotypic implications of SHP2 phosphorylation status were not
directly evaluated. Our finding that reconstitution of SHP2Y542F in SHP2-depleted H1666
cells rescued ERK phosphorylation as efficiently as SHP2WT suggests that SHP2 Y542
phosphorylation is dispensable for SHP2-mediated activation of ERK, consistent with
previous findings regarding EGF-mediated ERK activation in 3T3 fibroblasts.9 Thus,
impaired SHP2 phosphorylation with EGFR mutation may not be the cause, but rather a
result, of a mechanism whereby SHP2 function (but not activity) is diminished by SHP2
sequestration. We also note that despite the lack of an effect of SHP2 knockdown in H3255
cells (EGFRL858R), there were small effects of SHP2 knockdown in HCC827 cells
(EGFRE746_A750del). This difference between H3255 and HCC827 cells could reflect a

functional difference between the two EGFR mutants or a differential role of receptors such
as MET, which is basally phosphorylated to a higher degree in HCC827 cells.6
Based on our studies of GAB1 knockdown, GAB1 function may also be perturbed by EGFR
mutation. GAB1 also appears to be an important determinant of cellular response to gefitinib
in an NSCLC cell line expressing wild-type EGFR. This could be due to the function of
GAB1 upstream of SHP2 in regulating ERK phosphorylation, the function of GAB1 in
promoting AKT phosphorylation by recruiting PI3K, or both. Additional work is needed to
clarify the role and regulation of GAB1.
Mechanistic insights

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our data suggest that EGFR mutation promotes constitutive binding of a fraction of SHP2 to
EGFR through GAB1 and other adapters. Since adapter engagement of SHP2′s SH2
domains promotes SHP2 activity, it is perhaps not surprising that SHP2 was biochemically
active in cells with EGFR mutation. Given these findings, our immunofluorescence
microscopy and subcellular fractionation results, and previous findings that EGFR mutants
are endocytosis-impaired, EGFR mutation appears to result in sequestration of at least some
SHP2 at the plasma membrane in a state where it should be biochemically active. The
finding that not all SHP2 was sequestered at the plasma membrane in cells with EGFR
mutation (as observed by immunofluorescence and fractionation) could be a stoichiometric
effect. Indeed, in A431 cells, with over 3 × 106 EGFR/cell, a more complete redistribution
of SHP2 to the cell periphery was observed in response to EGF than we observed.27
Moreover, in EGFR mutant cells, the SHP2 which is not sequestered, and less likely to be
adapter-bound, should be at a lower activity and therefore less functionally relevant. This
model is consistent with our findings that in EGFR mutant cells, where only a fraction of
SHP2 was sequestered, SHP2 depletion had relatively small effects, but expression of
constitutively active SHP2 rescued ERK phosphorylation and sensitivity to gefitinib. The
reason why SHP2 sequestration may impede SHP2′s ability to promote ERK
phosphorylation could be related to previous findings that normal EGFR endocytosis is
required for complete ERK activation in some cellular contexts.16 This coupling between
endocytosis and ERK could involve a role for SHP2 localization wherein normal trafficking
of SHP2-containing complexes promotes ERK activity by allowing complex access to
substrates in the cell interior (Figure 9).
Therapeutic implications

Author Manuscript

SHP2 knockdown in an NSCLC cell line was previously shown to slow xenograft growth in
mice.28 In addition, SHP2-activating mutations have been found in solid tumors, including
NSCLC.15 As far as we are aware, however, the effects of SHP2 expression and mutation on
cellular response to EGFR inhibition have not previously been evaluated. Our finding that
SHP2 knockdown in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR enhanced cellular response
to gefitinib suggests that combined inhibition of EGFR and SHP2 may improve response in
tumors that are unresponsive to EGFR inhibition alone. The largest effects of SHP2
knockdown on enhancing response to EGFR inhibition in cells with wild-type EGFR tended
to occur at or below 1 μM gefitinib, the maximum achievable plasma concentration at a
clinically relevant dose.29 Thus, it is conceivable that such a co-inhibition strategy could

have clinical impact. Our finding that expression of constitutively active SHP2 mutants
mitigated the effects of gefitinib on ERK phosphorylation in H1666 and H3255 cells
suggests that SHP2 activity can maintain the activity of ERK in the presence of EGFR
inhibitors. Although we noted no major effect of ectopic expression of these mutants on
sensitivity to gefitinib in H1666 cells, H3255 cells expressing SHP2E76A displayed
decreased sensitivity to gefitinib. It would therefore be interesting to explore the
implications for drug resistance in cells with SHP2 mutation.
Summary

Author Manuscript

Our findings point to SHP2 as a potential target to be co-inhibited with EGFR in the
treatment of NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR. Expanding these studies to an in vivo
model would be helpful in determining if a clinical benefit for combined SHP2/EGFR
inhibition exists, although such studies would be hampered by the present lack of effective
and specific SHP2 inhibitors. Our findings also highlight the non-intuitive possibility for
activating mutations of receptors such as EGFR to impair the function of specific signaling
pathways in ways which promote cellular response to receptor-targeting therapeutics.

500 μg of total protein from cell lysates was incubated overnight with agarose beads
conjugated to an SHP2 antibody. Beads were washed with lysis buffer and split into two

resuspended in assay buffer containing 100 μM 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate
(Invitrogen). The reaction was performed at 37°C for 30 min with occasional mixing, and
reaction product fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360

Coverslips were washed again, mounted on glass slides, and treated with Prolong Gold

To analyze individual cells from these images, MATLAB was used to determine pixel
intensities as a function of distance from the cell center. This was done by outlining
individual cells, locating cell centers, and generating lines from the center to the cell
periphery in all angular directions, along which pixel intensities were quantified. Data were
averaged and normalized to obtain a vector of intensities versus normalized distances from
the cell center.
Subcellular fractionation
Serum starved cells were treated with 0 or 5 μM gefitinib, washed, and collected in
hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with
1 mM PMSF, additional protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. Crude lysates were
generated with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 3000 and 9300 rpm, for 5 min at
each speed, to remove nuclei and mitochondria, respectively. Cleared lysates were
centrifuged at 100 000 g for 60 min to separate membrane and cytosol fractions. Membrane

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Cellular RNA was isolated using an RNEasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and cDNA
was transcribed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosciences, Foster City, CA, USA). Using the cDNA as a template, qPCR was performed
with previously developed primers for GAB1 mRNA using SYBR Green Master Mix
(Applied Biosciences).31 Reactions were monitored on a Model 7300 Real Time PCR
System (Applied Biosciences). RNA polymerase II mRNA was quantified as a
normalization control using 5′-GCACCACGTCCAATGACAT-3′ as the forward primer and
5′-GTGCGGCTGCTTCCATAA-3′ as the reverse primer.

GAB1 and EGFR are basally associated with SHP2 in NSCLC cells expressing EGFR
mutants and are induced to associate with SHP2 by EGF in NSCLC cells expressing wildtype EGFR. Serum-starved cells treated with or without 10 ng/mL EGF for 5 min (a), or
serum-starved H3255 cells treated with or without 5 μM gefitinib for 15 min (b), were lysed.
Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either an SHP2 or control antibody, and
immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against the
indicated proteins. Images are representative of three sets of biological replicates.
Densitometry data in (a) are represented as mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3); * denotes p < 0.05 relative
to wild-type EGFR-expressing cells not stimulated with EGF. (c) Subcellular fractions were
prepared from H1666 and H3255 cells treated with or without gefitinib, as described in
Materials and Methods, and equivalent relative amounts of the fractions for both cell lines
were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against indicated proteins. To improve
signals, membrane fractions were 10× more concentrated than cytosolic fractions in terms of
the relative amount of total lysate loaded. Images are representative of three sets of
biological replicates. Blots were quantified to determine the relative difference in
membrane-localized SHP2 in H1666 versus H3255 cells. For each condition, SHP2 signal
from the membrane fraction was divided by the SHP2 signal from the cytosol fraction to
determine a membrane/cytosol SHP2 signal. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. (n = 4);

Sequestration of SHP2 at the plasma membrane may enhance gefitinib response in cells
expressing EGFR mutants by reducing ERK activity. In the proposed mechanism, EGFR
activation and phosphorylation leads to recruitment of GRB2, which is constitutively bound
with GAB1 via an SH3 domain-mediated interaction. Phosphorylated GAB1 (and possibly
other adapters) recruits SHP2, whose activity leads to ERK activation through
dephosphorylation of a RASGAP binding site on GAB1 (as shown) or through other
mechanisms (as depicted by dotted arrow), such as dephosphorylation of CSK binding sites
on PAG/CBP and paxillin. The function of SHP2 in this complex at both the plasma
membrane and the cell interior leads to complete ERK phosphorylation. When SHP2 is
sequestered at the plasma membrane in complex with internalization-impaired mutant EGFR
(e.g. EGFRL858R), ERK phosphorylation is impaired. Due in part to impaired ERK activity
resulting from sequestration of SHP2, cells with EGFR mutants display increased sensitivity
to EGFR inhibition.
