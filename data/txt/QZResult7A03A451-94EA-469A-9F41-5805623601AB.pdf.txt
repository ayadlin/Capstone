ABSTRACT
Cisplatin (CisPt) is frequently used in the therapy of urothelial carcinoma (UC).
Its therapeutic efficacy is limited by inherent or acquired drug resistance. Here, we
comparatively investigated the CisPt-induced response of two different parental
urothelial carcinoma cell lines (RT-112, J-82) with that of respective drug resistant
variants (RT-112R, J-82R) obtained upon month-long CisPt selection. Parental RT-112
cells were ~2.5 fold more resistant to CisPt than J-82 cells and showed a different
expression pattern of CisPt-related resistance factors. CisPt resistant RT-112R and
J-82R variants revealed a 2–3-fold increased CisPt resistance as compared to their
corresponding parental counterparts. Acquired CisPt resistance was accompanied by
morphological alterations resembling epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). RT112R cells revealed lower apoptotic frequency and more pronounced G2/M arrest
following CisPt exposure than RT-112 cells, whereas no differences in death induction
were observed between J-82 and J-82R cells. CisPt resistant J-82R cells however were
characterized by a reduced formation of CisPt-induced DNA damage and related DNA
damage response (DDR) as compared to J-82 cells. Such difference was not observed
between RT-112R and RT-112 cells. J-82R cells showed an enhanced sensitivity to
pharmacological inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and, moreover, could be resensitized to CisPt upon Chk1 inhibition. Based on the data we suggest that mechanisms
of acquired CisPt resistance of individual UC cells are substantially different, with
apoptosis- and DDR-related mechanisms being of particular relevance. Moreover, the
findings indicate that targeting of Chk1 might be useful to overcome acquired CisPt
resistance of certain subtypes of UC.

INTRODUCTION

generated by CisPt are DNA intrastrand crosslinks (GpG
and ApG). Only 1–2% of the DNA crosslinks formed by
CisPt are DNA interstrand crosslinks [6, 7]. Platinuminduced DNA crosslinks cause a substantial distortion
of the DNA double helix, resulting in transcription and
replication blockage [8, 9]. In consequence of stalled
replication forks, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can
arise as secondary lesions [10]. DSBs are potent triggers
of cell death [11] and can be repaired by DNA doublestrand break repair (homologous recombination (HR)
or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)). The removal
of CisPt-induced DNA crosslinks involves nucleotide
excision repair (NER), including transcription-coupled

Bladder cancer is a frequent type of cancer worldwide. In most countries, the majority of bladder cancers
are urothelial carcinoma (UC) [1]. Cisplatin (CisPt)based therapeutic regimen are commonly used both in the
perioperative (neoadjuvant, adjuvant) setting for muscleinvasive UC as well as in the palliative setting for recurrent
or metastatic UC [2]. CisPt enters cells by passive
diffusion as well as by help of transporters [3, 4]. Upon
replacement of its chloride ligands by water, DNA adducts
are formed by SN2 mechanism (nucleophilic substitution)
[5]. The vast majority (60–80%) of DNA adducts

NER (TC-NER) [9]. The relevance of NER mechanisms
for the tumor cell response to CisPt is highlighted by the
fact that the expression of the NER factor ERCC1 predicts
the therapeutic efficacy of CisPt in lung tumors [12, 13]
and also seems to be of relevance for UC [14]. The
efficacy of platinum-based therapy is limited by intrinsic
or acquired drug resistance [15]. Factors that contribute to
CisPt resistance are manifold and are poorly characterized
for UC [16, 17]. Recently, mechanisms affecting resistance
to CisPt have been classified according to their site of
action as pre-, on-, post- and off-target [17], with drug
transport, DNA repair, apoptosis and signal transduction
at membranes, respectively, being representatives of these
mechanisms.
Upon induction of DNA damage a highly complex
cellular stress response program, known as the DNA
damage response (DDR), is activated. It tightly controls
cell cycle progression by activation of cell cycle
checkpoints and fine-tunes mechanisms of DNA repair and
cell death [18, 19]. Activation of the DDR is considered
as an inducible barrier against early tumorigenesis [20, 21]
and, moreover, to precede genomic instability in bladder
cancer [22]. In case of error prone repair of DSBs,
genomic instability of bladder carcinomas is favoured
[23]. DSBs as well as replication- and transcriptionblocking DNA lesions are particular efficient activators
of the DDR. The PI3-like kinases ATM and ATR play
key roles in the regulation of the DDR [24, 25]. These
kinases phosphorylate numerous substrates, among
others checkpoint kinases (e.g. Chk1, Chk2) and p53,
which eventually affect survival or death of the damaged
cell. The relevance of DDR mechanisms for the CisPt
sensitivity of UC cells and, most importantly, for CisPt
resistant variants, is largely unknown.
Urothelial cancer cells segregate into epithelial and
mesenchymal subsets [26]. Therefore, we included both
RT-112 and J-82 cells, which are described as UC cells
of mainly epithelial- and mesenchymal-like phenotype,
respectively [27, 28], in our study. To select CisPt resistant
variants we took into account that the therapeutic regimen
commonly used in CisPt-based anticancer therapy comprises
repetitive treatment cycles, where CisPt is administered by
infusion, intermitted by treatment free periods. Therefore,
parental RT-112 and J-82 UC cells were selected for
resistance by multiple pulse-treatments with CisPt followed
by extended recovery periods. The aim of the study was
to comparatively analyze CisPt resistant UC cell variants
(RT-112R and J-82R) with their respective parental cell types
regarding (i) DDR capacity, (ii) the expression of putative
CisPt resistance factors as suggested by Galluzzi et al.
[17] and (iii) the response to a subset of pharmacological
modifiers of the DDR and DNA repair, including inhibitors
of checkpoint kinases, which are promising novel anticancer
compounds acting by selectively increasing replicative
stress and cell death in malignant cells [29]. In doing so,
we aimed to identify mechanisms that are of relevance

for acquired CisPt resistance of UC cells and, moreover,
to figure out therapeutic options to overcome their CisPt
resistant phenotype.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of the CisPt response of the urothelial
carcinoma cells RT-112 and J-82
In light of the fact that urothelial cancer cells
can segregate into epithelial and mesenchymal subsets
[26], RT-112 und J-82 cells, which are representative of
epithelial- and mesenchymal-like UC cells, respectively
[27, 28], were used in the present study. RT-112 cells differ
from J-82 regarding morphology (Figure 1A) and a higher
mRNA expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin as
well as a lower expression of the mesenchymal marker
vimentin (Figure 1B) as expected. Proliferation rate was
higher in RT-112 as compared to J-82 cells (Figure 1C).
Analyzing the influence of CisPt on cell viability 24–72
h after CisPt pulse-treatment, we observed that RT-112
cells are 2–3-fold more resistant to moderate doses of
CisPt than J-82 cells (Figure 1D–1F). This is reflected
by IC50/IC80 values of 10.7 µM / 44.3 µM and 3.9 µM /
13.5 µM for RT-112 and J-82, respectively, as determined
after a post-incubation period of 72 h by the Alamar blue
assay (Figure 1F). This difference in drug sensitivity is
not detectable anymore at very high CisPt doses of ≥
80 µM (Figure 1D–1G). Measuring cell viability via an
alternative method, i.e. the Neutral red assay, similar
results were obtained (Figure 1G). Based on a recent
report of Galluzzi et al. [17], who has classified putative
CisPt resistance factors of tumor cells, we assembled a
96 well-based quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR array to
comparatively analyze the mRNA expression of these
factors in RT-112 and J-82 cells. The results of this
analysis revealed large cell type-specific differences in
the basal mRNA expression of both pre-, on-, post- as
well as off-target factors [17]. In more detail, we observed
a significantly stronger mRNA expression of ATP7A,
BRCA1, VDAC, Calpain, p53, Caspase 6 and ERBB2
in RT-112 cells as compared to J-82 cells. By contrast,
J-82 cells revealed an enhanced expression of MT1A,
XAF1, BCL2, DYRK1VB, HMOX1, GPX1 and HSPA1B as
compared to RT-112 cells (Figure 2A, 2B). Analysing gene
expression 72 h after treatment with the IC50 of CisPt, we
found upregulation of GPX1 and XAF1 concommitantly in
both RT-112 and J-82 cells (Figure 2C, 2D). Notably, J-82
cells responded to CisPt treatment with the upregulation of
various DNA repair-related factors (i.e. BRCA1, BRCA2,
MSH2, XRCC3) (Figure 2D). This response was not found
in RT-112 cells (Figure 2C). Taken together, the data show
that both basal and CisPt-stimulated mRNA expression of
factors affecting CisPt sensitivity [17] considerably vary
between the two examined UC cell lines, indicating that
the basal defence capacity of epithelial- and mesenchymallike UC cells against CisPt-induced injury might be

analyzing the CisPt response of additional UC cell lines of
epithelial or mesenchymal origin both in vitro and in vivo.

and J-82 cells were repeatedly pulse-treated twice a
week (for each 4 h) with the corresponding IC50 of CisPt,
followed by a recovery period of one week (Figure 3A).
After a total selection time of 10 weeks, CisPt resistant
RT-112R und J-82R cells were obtained (Figure 3B–3D).
Measuring cell viability by the Alamar blue assay, the
resistant variants revealed an about 3-fold increase in
the IC50 as compared to the corresponding parental cells
(Figure 3B–3D). Similar results were obtained using

the Neutral red assay (data not shown). Gain of CisPt
resistance was accompanied by morphological alterations,
in particular cell enlargement and distinct cell protrusions
(Figure 3B–3D). Both RT-112R and J-82R cells showed
an increased mRNA expression of the intermediate
filament vimentin (Figure 3C–3E) as compared to
their respective parental cells. As vimentin expression
represents a prototypical marker of mesenchymal cells,
we hypothesize that the development of an EMT-like
phenotype is favoured in epithelial-like RT-112 cells and
is further promoted in J-82 cells during the selection of
CisPt resistant UC cell variants. A coherence between
EMT and acquired drug resistance was reported by

others [26, 30–32]. Flow cytometry-based analyses
performed 72 h after CisPt treatment showed a reduction
of apoptotic cell death in RT-112R cells as compared to
RT-112 (Figure 4A). This effect was only observed in
RT-112R cells (Figure 4A, upper panel) but not in J-82R
cells (Figure 4A, lower panel). Both RT-112R and J-82R
cells were characterized by a more pronounced activation
of G2/M checkpoint mechanisms as compared to their
corresponding parental counterparts (Figure 4B). The data
show that the mechanisms of acquired CisPt resistance
differ between individual UC cell lines with protection
from CisPt-induced apoptotic mechanisms and alterations
in checkpoint control mechanisms being involved.

relevant.

Induction of DNA damage and activation of the
DNA damage response (DDR) in parental and
CisPt resistant UC cell variants

as secondary lesions from primary DNA platinumadducts that stall replication forks [10]. As observed
4 h and 24 h after CisPt pulse-treatment for 4 h, we
found a significant reduction in the number of DSBs in
J-82R cells, but not in RT-112R cells (Figure 5A–5B).
This finding indicates that CisPt resistance of J-82R cells,
but not of RT-112R cells, might result from a reduced
formation of highly cytotoxic DSBs and/or attenuated
DDR following CisPt treatment. Bearing in mind that
CisPt-induced DSBs mainly originate from primary Pt(GpG) DNA adducts, we next monitored the formation
of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks by Southwestern blot
analyses. The data show that DNA intrastrand crosslink
formation was significantly lower in the J-82R subline
as compared to J-82 parental cells (Figure 5D). Based
on these observations we suggest that acquired CisPt

In order to measure the induction of DNA damage
following CisPt treatment, ATM/ATR-catalyzed S139
phosphorylation of histone H2AX and the recruitment
of 53BP1 to sites of damage were monitored by
immunocytochemistry (Figure 5A–5B). Moreover, the
level of CisPt-induced DNA intrastrand crosslinks was
monitored by Southwestern analysis (Figure 5C–5D).
The formation of nuclear γH2AX foci and 53BP1 foci
is part of the DNA damage response (DDR) and is
believed to reflect predominantly the formation of DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) [19]. Following CisPt
treatment, DSBs are believed to be mainly generated

resistance of J-82 cells involves a reduced formation of
primary (i.e. Pt-(GpG) adducts) and secondary (i.e. DSBs)
DNA damage following CisPt treatment. Mechanistically,
it is feasible that pre-target resistance mechanisms such
as transport or detoxification mechanisms take part [17].
In this context it is noteworthy that the level of CisPt-

induced Pt-(GpG) DNA intrastrand crosslinks is higher
in parental J-82 cells as compared to RT-112 cells (Figure
5C) if the corresponding IC50 and IC80 were used. This
finding indicates that the level of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand
crosslinks does not necessarily predicts the level of
cytotoxicity.

In a next step we comparatively analyzed the DDR
of UC parental cells and corresponding CisPt resistant
variants following CisPt treatment by Western blot
analysis. The data obtained uncover large variations in the
activation of DDR mechanisms already in J-82 versus RT112 parental cells, as reflected on the levels of γH2AX,
p-Chk1, p-p53 and p-Kap1 (Figure 6A–6B). In general,
J-82 revealed a more profound activation of the DDR than
RT-112 cells. This is likely related to the higher level of
Pt-(GpG) adducts in J-82 cells (see Figure 5C), resulting
in stronger activation of DDR mechanisms. Comparative
analyses of J-82 cells versus CisPt resistant J-82R cells
showed lower phosphorylation levels of H2AX, Chk1,
p53 and Kap1 in the CisPt resistant variants (Figure 6A).
Again, this is in line with the observed decrease in Pt(GpG) DNA adducts and DSB formation described in J-82R
as compared to J-82 cells (see Figure 5). RT-112R cells
revealed a specifically increased phosphorylation of Chk1
as compared to RT-112 parental cells (Figure 6B). This is
indicative of a selectively increased potency of RT-112R

cells to activate checkpoint control mechanisms that might
contribute to protection from CisPt induced apoptotic
mechanisms (see Figure 4A).

Expression of CisPt susceptibility factors in
CisPt resistant UC cells
Next, we analyzed the mRNA expression of
CisPt-related susceptibility factors reported by Galluzzi
et al. [17] in RT-112R and J-82R cells as compared to the
corresponding parental cells. Regarding RT-112R cells, we
found a significant increase in the mRNA expression of
metallothionein (MT1A) and the XIAP-associated factor
1 (XAF1) as compared to RT-112 cells (Figure 7B). In
J-82R cells we observed an elevated mRNA expression of
the antioxidative factors heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and
glutathione S-transerase M1 (GSTM1) as well as of XAF1
as compared to the corresponding controls (Figure 7A).
Hence, the two types of CisPt resistant UC cell variants
were characterized by an increased mRNA expression of

CisPt resistant cells. Parental (J-82 (A) and RT-112 (B)) and CisPt resistant (J-82R (A) and RT-112R (B)) cells were treated with the IC50
or IC80 of CisPt (according to Figure 1F) for 4 h. After post-incubation periods of 4 h or 24 h cells were harvested for Western blot analyses
using phospho-specific antibodies as indicated. For control, cells were irradiated with 10 Gy (IR) and analysis was performed 1 h later. Data
shown are representative of two independent experiments. Expression of β-actin was determined as protein loading control.

XAF1. In this context we would like to note that selection of
CisPt resistant J-82 and RT-112 cells by a selection protocol
using continuous treatment with increasing CisPt doses
over a time period of 4 month also resulted in increased
level of XAF1 mRNA in CisPt resistant J-82 cells but not
in RT-112 cells (Supplementary Figure S1). The finding
of upregulated XAF1 mRNA expression in drug resistant
UC cell variants was unexpected considering that XAF1 is
known to inhibit the anti-apoptotic factor XIAP, and hence
is anticipated to promote cell death [33]. Correspondingly,
high XAF1 level was suggested as predictive marker in
pancreatic cancer associated with better overall survival
[34]. Therefore, it appears possible that its increased
mRNA expression in J-82R cells accidentially correlates
with CisPt resistance but is not causative for acquired
CisPt resistance of UC cells. Alternatively, XAF1 might
have a so far not yet decribed pro-survival function in CisPt
resistant UC cells. In this context it is noteworthy that a
cell cycle regulatory function has been suggested for XAF1
in gastrointestinal cancer, which rests on its interaction
with Chk1 [35]. Interestingly enough induction of XAF1
mRNA expression was also observed in both J-82 and
RT-112 parental cells 72 h after CisPt addition (see Figure

2C–2D). So, forthcoming studies are clearly required to
dissect the role of XAF1 in the response of UC cells to
CisPt. In addition, the data indicate that the improvement
of anti-oxidative capacity, as reflected by the upregulation
of HMOX1 and GSTM1, and increased expression of
metallothionein MT1A might be of particular relevance for
acquired CisPt resistance of some subtypes of UC. Bearing
in mind that oxidative stress contributes to the cytotoxicity
of CisPt [36, 37], upregulation of anti-oxidative
mechanisms might be a meaningful cytoprotective strategy
of UC cells, as is the upregulation of metallothioneins [38].
Noteworthy, upregulation of the mRNA expression of DNA
repair factors (i.e. BRCA1, BRCA2, ERCC1, MLH1, MSH2,
XRCC3), which are involved in the repair of CisPt-induced
DNA damage, was not observed in the CisPt resistant
variants.

J-82R cells show enhanced sensitivity to a Chk1
inhibitor
In search of pharmacological approaches to
overcome acquired CisPt resistance of J-82R cells,
we examined their sensitivity to a selected subset of

resistant J-82R (A) and RT-112R cells (B) as compared to the corresponding parental cells by qRT-PCR. Relative mRNA expression in
parental J-82 cells was set to 1.0. Only alterations in gene expression of ≤ 0.5 or ≥ 2.0 between wild-type (J-82 and RT-112) and CisPt
resistant variants (J-82R and RT-112R) were considered as biologically relevant. Shown are the genes that are either up- or downregulated
in CisPt resistant cells as compared to the parental cells.

lost upon freezing. For these analyses inhibitors of the

targeting of ATR/Chk1-regulated replicative stress
responses of tumor cells has recently been suggested as
a novel therapeutic strategy [29]. As additional candidate
inhibitors we analyzed the impact of the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine, the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib, which is frequently used as anticancer
drug in the clinic, as well as of inhibitors of the DNA
repair proteins RAD51 (RI-1) and PARP-1 (olaparib) on
the viability of parental J-82 versus resistant J-82R cells.
As a further candidate inhibitor we employed lovastatin,
because statins have been shown to exhibit anticancer
activity in various preclinical model systems [39] and
are discussed to overcome acquired drug resistance to
doxorubicin in neuroblastoma cells [40].
J-82R cells turned out to be slightly more sensitive
to treatment with the pan Chk inhibitor AZD-7762
(Figure  8A) and showed a significantly enhanced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitivity to the Chk1-specific inhibitor LY2603618 as
compared to parental cells (Figure 8B). The J-82R cells also
revealed a tendentially enhanced sensitivity to the Wee1
kinase inhibitor MK-1775 (Figure 8C) but not to the CDK
inhibitor roscovitine (Figure 8D). The pronounced loss
of cell viability of J-82R cells following Chk1 inhibition
seems to be specific as it was not observed upon inhibition
of ATM/ATR kinase or the DNA repair factors RAD51
and PARP-1 (Table 1). Pre-treatment of J-82R cells with
low non-toxic concentration of Chk inhibitors increased
their sensitivity to CisPt (Figure 8E–8F), indicating that
targeting of Chk might be particular useful to overcome
acquired CisPt resistance of some subtypes of UC cells.
Whether targeting of Chk is equally effective in epithelial
and mesenchymal-like UC cells remains to be elucidated
in forthcoming studies. Noteworthy, Chk inhibition was
reported to overcome CisPt resistance of head and neck
cancer cells [41] as well as of clear cell carcinoma of the
ovary [42] in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that targeting
of Chk might be a useful approach to deal with acquired
CisPt resistance of different types of tumor cells. Taken
together, our data support the current view that increasing
replicative stress in tumor cells might be a promising
therapeutic strategy also in UC [29]. In fact, the antitumor
potency of Chk1 inhibitors is currently investigated in
41329

Oncotarget

clinical trials. Whereas AZD-7762 revealed inacceptable
cardiotoxicity [43], SCH-900776 seems to be better
tolerated in humans [44].
Taken together the data show that different
molecular mechanims are involved in acquired resistance
of different types of UC cells to CisPt. Apparently,
molecularly different sets of CisPt defence programs can
become activated in individual UC cells. We hypothesize
that acquired CisPt resistance in (epithelial-like) RT-

112 cells might be preferentially related to protection
from pro-apoptotic mechanisms, whereas gain of CisPt
resistance in (mesenchymal-like) J-82 UC cells seems to
be characterized by a lower level of CisPt formed DNA
damage and attenuated DDR. Mechanisms of transport
and DNA repair seem to be of minor relevance for
aquired CisPt resistance of UC cells. Hence, therapeutic
targeting of apoptosis- and/or DDR-related mechanisms
are suggested as preferential to overcome acquired

Determination of cell viability

CisPt resistance in UC. Importantly, inhibitors of Chk
might be useful to handle CisPt resistance in UC cells.
Forthcoming in vivo studies are required to scrutinize the
potency of Chk1 specific inhibitors to work against the
non-responsiveness of urothelial carcinoma cells to CisPtbased anticancer therapy in a clincally relevant setting.

Cell viability was determined using the Alamar blue
assay [45]. In this assay, viable cells are detectable by their
ability to effectively metabolize the non-fluorescent dye
resazurin (Sigma, Steinheim (Germany)) to fluorescent
resorufin. Cells were incubated for 1.5 h with the resazurin
solution (final concentration 40 µM) before fluorescence
was measured (excitation: 535 nm, emission: 590 nm,
5 flashes, integration time: 20 µs). Relative viability in
the untreated controls was set to 100%. In addition, cell
viability was also determined by use of the Neutral red
assay [46]. In this assay, viable cells accumulate the
red dye 2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethylaminophenazine
in lysosomes, whereas dead cells are unable to do so.
Thus, the staining intensity is directly proportional to the
number of viable cells. For this assay, cells were incubated
for 1.5 h with the neutral red solution (Sigma Aldrich
(Steinheim, Germany)) (final concentration 0.1  mg/ml)
before fixation with 1% formaldehyde. Afterwards the
dye was extracted with 50% ethanol and absorption was
measured at 550 nm. Relative viability in the untreated
controls was set to 100%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
RT-112 and J-82 urothelial carcinoma cells originate
from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Culture (DSMZ) (Braunschweig, Germany). Cisplatin
was obtained from the pharmaceutical department of
the University Hospital Düsseldorf and originates from
TEVA (Ulm, Germany). The following antibodies were
used: antibodies detecting Ser139 phosphorylated histone
H2AX (γH2AX), H2AX (Millipore (Billerica, MA,
USA)), b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA)), 53BP1, p-p53, p-Chk1, p-p38 (Cell Signaling
(Denvers, MA, USA)), p-Chk2 (Abcam (Cambridge,
UK)), p-RPA32 and p-KAP1 (Bethyl Laboratories
(Montgomery, AL, USA)). The antibody detecting GpG
intrastrand crosslinks induced by CisPt was generously
provided by J. Thomale (Essen, Germany) and has been
described before [30]. The fluorescent antibodies Alexa
Flour 488 and 546 were obtained from Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies were purchased from Rockland
(Gilbertsville, PA, USA). ATM/ATR inhibitor VE-822
(CatNo:S7102) and Wee1 kinase inhibitor MK-1775
(CatNo: S1525) were obtained from Selleckchem (Munich,
Germany), lovastatin (CatNo: M2147), cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor roscovitine (CatNo: R7772) and the pan
(i.e. Chk1 and Chk2) checkpoint kinase (Chk) inhibitor
AZD-7762 (CatNo: SMLO350) from Sigma Aldrich
Life Science (Darmstadt, Germany), Rad51 inhibitor
RI-1 (CatNo: 553514) from Calbiochem (San Diego,
CA, United States), Chk1-specific inhibitor LY2603618
(CatNo: A8638) and PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib (CatNo:
A4154) are from Apexbio (Houston, TX, USA) and the
Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Heidelberg, Germany) (CatNo:
Sc-220125).

Flow cytometry-based analysis of cell cycle
distribution and cell death
Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry. Adherent cells were trypsinized and combined
with the medium that contains floating cells. After
centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min, RT), cell pellet was
washed and resuspended in PBS. Afterwards, the cells
were fixed with ice-cold ethanol (–20°C, ≥ 20 min). After
centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min, 4°C) the supernatant was
discarded. The cells were resuspended in PBS containing
RNase A (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH (Heidelberg,
Germany)) (1 µg/µl) and incubated for 1 h at RT. After
adding of propidium iodide (Sigma (Steinheim, Germany))
cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis (Becton
Dickinson (Heidelberg, Germany)). The SubG1 fraction
was considered as a measure of dead (apoptotic) cells.

Analysis of DNA damage induction
The formation of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) was investigated by measuring the level of S139
phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX), which is a surrogate
marker of DNA damage [47, 48], by Western blot analysis
or by immunocytochemistry-based detection of nuclear
γH2AX and 53BP1 foci. For immunocytochemical
analysis, the cells were seeded onto coverslips. After
treatment the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (MERCK (Darmstadt,
Germany)) (15 min, RT) and incubated with ice-cold
methanol (over night, –20°C). After blocking (1.5 h, RT;
blocking solution: 5% BSA in PBS/0.3% Triton X-100,

Cell culture
RT-112 and J-82 cells were grown in DMEM
(Sigma (Steinheim, Germany)) containing 10% of fetal
calf serum (FCS) (PAA Labratories (Cölbe, Germany) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma (Steinheim, Germany))
at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. If not stated
otherwise, treatments of logarithmically growing cells
were performed 24 h after seeding.

incubation with γH2AX antibody (mouse) and 53BP1
antibody (rabbit) was performed (1:500, over night,
4°C), followed by further washing with PBS/0.3% Triton
X-100 and addition of the secondary fluorescence-labelled
antibody (1:500, 1 h, RT, in the dark). After washing, the
cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories
(Burlingame, CA, USA)) containing DAPI. Nuclear
gH2AX and 53BP1 foci were counted by microscopical
analysis using an Olympus BX43 fluorescence microscope
and the number of co-localized gH2AX and 53BP1 foci
was calculated.
The level of Pt-(GpG) DNA intrastrand crosslinks
was monitored by Southwestern blot analysis. To this
end, genomic DNA was isolated using the “DNeasy
Blood and Tissue” kit (Qiagen (Hilden, Germany)).
The concentration and purity of the DNA was measured
photometrically (NanoVueTMPlus (GE Healthcare, UK)).
0.5 μg of the DNA was diluted in 100 μl of TE buffer,
denatured by heating (10 min, 95°C) and cooled on ice.
Afterwards, 100 μl ice-cold ammonium acetate (2 M) was
added. A nitrocellulose membrane was soaked in 1 M
ammonium acetate and fixed into a slot-blot apparatus
(Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany)). The DNA was transferred
onto the membrane by use of a vacuum pump. After
washing with 1 M ammonium acetate and water, the
membrane was incubated with 5 × SSC (10 × SSC: 1.5 M
NaCl, 150 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 5 min and
baked for 2 h at 80oC before it was blocked in 5% non-fat
milk in TBS/0.1% Tween 20 over night at 4°C. Incubation
with the primary antibody directed against Pt-(GpG)
intrastrand crosslinks (1:200) [49] was conducted for 1 h
at RT, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated
anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (1:2000, 2 h, RT).
Visualization of the Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks was
done by chemiluminescence and autoradiographies were
densitometrically analyzed. Additionally, the membrane
was stained with methylene blue (MP Biomedicals (Santa
Ana, CA, USA)) to ensure equal DNA loading.

(MERCK (Darmstadt, Germany)) (2 h, RT), the membrane
was incubated with the corresponding primary antibody
(1:1000, over night, 4°C). After washing with TBS/0.1%
Tween 20 the secondary (peroxidase-conjugated) antibody
was added (1:2000, 2 h, RT). For visualization of the
bound antibodies the Fusion FX7 imaging system (PeqLab
(Erlangen, Germany)) was used.

Quantitative real-time PCR-based mRNA
expression analyses
Putative markers of CisPt susceptibility were
selected on the basis of a recent review by Galluzzi et al.
[17] who has classified putative CisPt resistance factors
of tumor cells into mechanisms of pre-, on-, post- and
off-target. Based on this report we assembled a 96 wellbased quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR array to analyze
the mRNA expression of these factors in RT-112 und
J-82 cells. In addition, mRNA expression of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin as well as the mesenchymal marker
vimentin and the proliferation factors c-Myc and cyclinD1
was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was purified using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen (Hilden, Germany)). The
reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction was performed by use
of the OmniScript Kit (Qiagen) with 2000 ng of mRNA.
For each PCR reaction 40 ng of cDNA and 0.25 µM of the
corresponding primers (Eurofins MWG Synthesis GmbH
(Ebersberg, Germany)) were used. Quantitative real-time
PCR analysis was performed in triplicates employing the
QPCR-SYBR Green Fluorescein Mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Dreieich, Germany)) and a CFX96 Real-Time
System (BioRad (Munich, Germany)) with the Bio-Rad
CFX Manager 3.1 software. PCR runs (35–40 cycles) were
done as follows: 95°C – 10 min; 95°C – 15 s; 60°C – 30 s;
72°C – 40 s; 72°C – 10 min. At the end of the runs, melting
curves were analyzed to ensure the specificity of the
amplification reaction. mRNA levels of β-actin, GAPDH,
PPIA, RPL32 and 18S were taken for normalization. If not
stated otherwise, relative mRNA expression of untreated
control cells was set to 1.0.

Western blot analysis

Statistical analysis

The activation status of the DNA damage response
(DDR) machinery was investigated by Western blot
analysis employing a set of phospho-specific antibodies,
which detect prototypical factors that become activated
by phosphorylation in the course of the DDR. Total cell
extracts were obtained by lysing an equal number of
cells in Roti®-Load buffer (Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe,
Germany)) (5 min, RT). After sonication (EpiShear™
Probe sonicator, Active Motif (La Hulpe, Belgium))
proteins were denatured by heating (5 min, 95°C) and
separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel). Subsequently,
proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK)) via the Protean
Mini Cell System (BioRad (München, Germany)). After
blocking in 5% non-fat milk in TBS/0.1% Tween 20

For statistical analysis the unpaired two-tailed
Student’s t-test was applied using the GraphPad Prism 5.01
software. p-Values ≤ 0.05 were considered as significant
and were marked with an asterisk.
