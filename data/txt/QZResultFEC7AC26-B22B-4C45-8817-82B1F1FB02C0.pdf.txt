BACKGROUND. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a relatively rare but aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options. Previous genome-wide expression studies have demonstrated the overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor alpha2 (IL13Ra2) in some
human malignancies. METHODS. The authors evaluated IL13Ra2 mRNA and protein expression in 21 normal samples, 78 benign samples, 10 primary malignant samples, and 25 metastatic/recurrent samples and performed functional analyses with IL13 ligand and IL13
Ra2 knockdown in vitro. The sensitivity of 2 ACC cell lines (NCI-H295R [high IL13Ra2 expression] and SW13 [low IL13Ra2 expression])
to a highly specific IL-13 conjugated with Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL-13-PE) also was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo models.
RESULTS. IL13Ra2 was overexpressed in malignant tumors compared with benign and normal samples (15-fold higher; P < .05).
Immunohistochemistry also confirmed higher protein expression in malignant and benign tumors than in normal adrenocortical
tissues (P < .05). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration for IL-13-PE was 1.3 ng/mL in the NCI-H295R cell line and 1000 ng/mL in
the SW13 cell line. Mice that received intratumoral or intraperitoneal IL-13-PE injection had a significant reduction in tumor size and
increased tumor necrosis compared with control groups (P < .05) and also had prolonged survival (P < .05). IL13Ra2 protein expression increased in cells that were treated with IL-13 ligand along with cell invasion (P < .05). Direct IL13Ra2 knockdown decreased cellular proliferation and invasion (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that IL13Ra2 is overexpressed in ACC and
regulates cell invasion and proliferation. IL13Ra2 is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human ACC. Cancer 2012;118:5698708. Published 2012 by the American Cancer Society*.

INTRODUCTION
With an annual incidence of approximately 0.72 cases per million, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy of the
adrenal cortex with a poorly understood mechanism of development.1-4 Currently, surgical resection is the only possible curative therapy for patients with ACC; however, because the majority of patients present with metastatic disease, the 5-year survival
rate is <10%.1,5 Therefore, there is a significant need for new therapeutic options that may be effective in patients with ACC.
Because the molecular mechanism of adrenocortical tumorigenesis is not clearly defined, genome-wide gene expression profiling analysis of adrenocortical tumors has been used to determine dysregulated gene expression associated with
ACC.6-11 Interleukin-13 (IL-13) receptor alpha2 (IL13Ra2) has been identified as 1 gene that is overexpressed in ACC.10
IL13Ra2 is a high-affinity receptor of the T-helper 2 cell-derived cytokine IL-13 and is overexpressed in several tumors
compared with low or absent expression in normal cells and tissues.12-18 Initial studies suggested that IL13Ra2 binds IL13 ligand with high affinity but without activating any signal transduction pathways.19 Therefore, it was hypothesized
that the function of the extracellular domain of IL13Ra2 was to serve as a decoy receptor to regulate the signaling of type
II IL-13R complex (IL-13, IL13Ra1, and IL-4a) through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription
6 (JAK-STAT6) pathway.20,21 However, recently, it was demonstrated that high-affinity binding of IL-13 ligand to
IL13Ra2 does signal through a STAT6-independent activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway, which leads to increased transforming growth factor-b activity.22
Targeting cell-surface receptors or antigens with small molecules or immunotoxin therapies is an attractive strategy
for developing effective cancer therapy.23,24 It has been demonstrated that a chimeric fusion protein that consists of IL-13
and a mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL-13-PE) is highly cytotoxic to IL13Ra2-positive cancer cells in both in
vitro and vivo models of several malignancies.15,25,26

IL13Ra2 in Adrenocortical Carcinoma/Jain et al

In the current study, we demonstrate that IL13Ra2
is overexpressed in ACC. Furthermore, IL13Ra2 influences ACC cell invasion and is a good therapeutic target in
ACC cells in both in vitro and in vivo models using IL13-PE immunotoxin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Specimens

Our Institutional Review Board approved the protocol,
and all materials were collected after written informed
consent was obtained from patients. Adrenal tissues were
snap frozen at the time of surgery and stored at 80 C.
IL13Ra2 mRNA and protein expression were determined
in 134 human adrenocortical tissue specimens (21 normal
tissues, 78 benign adrenocortical tumors, 10 primary
ACCs, 23 ACC metastases, and 2 ACC recurrences). The
diagnosis of unequivocal ACC was confirmed in all cases
by histologic examination, the presence of lymph nodes
metastasis, distant metastasis, and/or the development of
locoregional recurrent disease during follow-up.
Cell Culture and Reagents

The NCI-H295R and SW13 ACC cell lines (American
Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md) were grown and
maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 1% insulin transferrrin selenium (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass) and 2.5% Nu-Serum I (BD
Biosciences) in a standard humidified incubator at 37 C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. PM-RCC, a renal cell carcinoma cell line, was maintained in Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bio-Whittaker Inc., Walkersville, Md), 1 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 lg/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/
mL streptomycin (Bio-Whittaker Inc.). The recombinant
IL-13-PE used in our studies has been described previously.25,27 IL-13 was obtained from Sigma Chemical
Company (St. Louis, Mo).
Immunohistochemical and Immunocytochemical
Staining

Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated
with the primary anti-IL13Ra2 goat polyclonal antibody
(AF146; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn) at 15
lg/mL dilution overnight at 4 C followed by biotinylated
secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, Calif) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were developed using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine DAB
as the chromogen (ABC Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories)
and counterstained with hematoxylin. The slides were
scanned under an Olympus light microscope (Nikon,
Cancer

November 15, 2012

Tokyo, Japan), and images were acquired at 20 and
40 magnification. A semiquantitative scoring system
was used to analyze IL13Ra2 expression; the expression
level was classified as 0 (no staining), 1 (<30% stained
cells), 2 (30%-50% stained cells), and 3 (>50% stained
cells). Two observers, who were blinded to the tumor
type, independently scored each sample.
Immunofluorescence staining was done using cultured NCI-H295R cells (1  105 cells in 1 mL) on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Rochester, NY). The cells were
allowed to adhere to slides for 48 hours and were incubated with IL-13 at 50 ng/mL for another 48 hours. Cells
were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed
with 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes. The cells were
incubated with primary anti-IL13Ra2 goat polyclonal
antibody at 1:100 dilution overnight (AF146; R&D Systems Inc.) at 4 C. The primary antibodies were detected
with fluorophore conjugated with RedTX antigoat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). The
slides were then rinsed and mounted with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting solution. Images were
captured with a Zeiss Axioskop-2 microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) at 20 and 40
magnification.
Reverse Transcription and Real-Time
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction

RNA samples from tissue samples and cell lines were subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis. Total RNA (200-500 ng) was reversetranscribed using a High Capacity Reverse Transcription
cDNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA expression levels, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) mRNA amplification from the same samples
served as an internal control. The normalized gene expression level was represented as 2̂ Ct of the gene of interest
 Ct of GAPDH)  100%, where Ct is the PCR cycle
threshold. The PCR primer probes for IL13Ra2
(Hs_010180383_m1) and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1)
were obtained from Applied Biosystems. All reactions
were performed in a final volume of 10 lL with 2 lL of
cDNA template on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycler condition
was 95 C for 12 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95 C
for 15 seconds and at 60 C for 1 minute.
Cell Culture and Transient Transfection

Cells were seeded onto 240-well and 6-well plates (4 
104 cells in 0.5 mL and 1.6  105 cells in 2 mL,
5699

Original Article

respectively). Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells
were transfected either with a nonspecific negative control
small interfering RNA (siRNA) (AM4613) or with a combination of IL13Ra2-specific siRNAs at a final concentration of 80 nM (s7376 and s7374; Applied Biosystems).
The TransIT-siQuest reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison,
Wis) was used to deliver siRNA to the cells according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell Proliferation

Cells were plated at a concentration of 5  103 cells per
100 lL culture medium in a 96-well plate in 6 replicates.
Cell numbers were determined by using the CyQUANT
assay kit (Invitrogen) and a fluorometric microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) at 480 nm/
520 nm.
Flow Cytometry

Seven days after transfection, the cells (1  105) were
incubated with 5 lg/mL of mouse monoclonal antiIL13Ra2 (Diaclone; B-D13; Rockland, Gilbertsville, Pa).
Positive staining or binding in the cells was detected using
secondary goat-antimouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Mo). The fluorescence associated with the live cells was
measured using a FACS Calibur device (BD Biosciences).
The cells were gated using secondary FITC-conjugated
antibody control.
Cell Invasion Assay

The extent of cell invasion was assessed using the BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In total, 1 
105 cells were seeded onto the inserts (8-lM pore sized
polycarbonate membranes) coated with a thin layer of
Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences).
The inserts were placed into a 24-well plate with 10%
serum-containing culture medium as a chemoattractant.
The plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 C. Cells that
invaded the Matrigel matrix to the lower surface of the
membrane were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Dade
Behring, Newark, NJ) and counted under a light
microscope.
Protein Synthesis Inhibition Assay

In total, 1  104 cells were plated in 96-well plate in 100
lL of complete growth medium for 24 hours. After 24
hours, the plates were replaced with leucine-free medium
(Biofluids, Rockville, Md) for 6 hours. IL-13-PE immunotoxin was added to the cells at 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL and
incubated for 20 hours at 37 C. Then, 1 lCi of (3H)labeled leucine (NEN Research Products, Boston, Mass)
was added to each well and incubated for an additional
5700

4 hours. The cells were harvested, and labeled leucine
incorporation was measured by a b plate counter (Perkin
Elmer, Waltham, Mass). The half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) was defined as the concentration of a
drug at which the proliferation was reduced by 50%.
A protein synthesis inhibition assay was performed
on Day 3 after IL13Ra2 siRNA and negative control
transfection. The transfection was carried out at a final
concentration of 100 nM IL13Ra2 siRNA and negative
control using 0.2 lL per well of TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC). After 48 hours, the cells
were treated with different concentrations of IL-13-PE
immunotoxin to assess the biologic activity of silenced
IL13Ra2. The IC50 values of the silenced cells were compared with negative control and medium. The experiment
was performed in quadruplicate with 2 independent biologic repeats.
Tumor Spheroids

In total, 1  105 NCI-H295R cells per well (in 0.5 mL)
were plated into 24-well Ultra Low Cluster Plates (Costar,
Corning, NY) to generate tumor spheroids. The plates
were cultured at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 1 week, and the medium was changed every 3 days. After 1 week of culture,
tumor spheroids were photographed under a dissecting
microscope and were treated with different concentrations
of IL-13-PE (0.13-6.5 ng/mL) or vehicle (0.2% human
serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) in duplicate.
The tumor spheroids were treated for 2 weeks (and were
dosed every first and third day).
Adrenocortical Carcinoma Xenografts in
Athymic Nude Mice

The institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
approved the ACC xenograft animal study protocol. Fiveweek to 6-weeks old (body weight, 20-22 g) female athymic NCr nu/nu mice were obtained from the Frederick
Cancer Center Animal Facilities (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Md). The mice were maintained according to the guidelines of the institute’s Animal Advisory
Committee. NCI-H295R cells were implanted by subcutaneous injection into the left flank with 4  106 cells in
100 lL Dulbecco modified Eagle medium and Matrigel
(1:1 dilution). Tumor sizes were measured every 7 days
and recorded in mm3 (length  width2/2). For tumor
therapy experiments, the mice were grouped into 5 groups
with 6 mice per group. Group I and II mice received intratumor injections (using Hamilton syringes; Hamilton80400-22s,2 inch) with 25 lL IL-13-PE (100 lg/kg) every other day for 1 week and 2 weeks, respectively. Group
III mice received intraperitoneal injection (using 27-gauge

but not in adjacent normal tissues.
Interleukin-13 Signals Through Interleukin-13
Receptor Alpha2 and Influences Adrenocortical
Carcinoma Cell Invasion

Given the high levels of IL13Ra2 expression in ACC, next,
we determined whether the receptor was biologically active.
Specifically, because it is believed that IL-13 signals through
IL13Ra2, we attempted to evaluate the responsiveness of the
IL13Ra2-overexpressing ACC cell line, NCI-H295R, to
IL-13 ligand. We observed significant induction of
IL13Ra2 in cells that were treated with 50 ng/mL of IL-13
5702

ligand (Fig. 2A). In addition, IL13Ra2 immunofluorescence
indicated that the receptor was expressed predominantly in
cell membrane and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A).
To better understand the potential biologic effects of
IL-13 and IL13Ra2 signaling in ACC cells, we also evaluated invasion as a measure of metastatic potential in NCIH295R cells in the presence or absence of IL-13. It was
demonstrated previously in pancreatic cancer cell lines that
IL-13 signals through IL13Ra2 to promote invasion.28 To
assess this response in ACC, we used siRNA to knockdown
IL13Ra2 expression in NCI-H295R cells. This approach
resulted in a 84% to 88% reduction in mRNA expression
within 24 hours compared with a negative control group,
and the reduction lasted up to 7 days (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we observed a 75% decrease in cell surface protein
expression of IL13Ra2 compared with negative controls after 7 days of transfection (Fig. 3A). NCI-H295R cells were
incubated with IL-13 to assess invasion. We observed that
the number of invading cells increased by 15% with IL-13
treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition, after quantification, the
number of invaded cells decreased by 44.7% in an
IL13Ra2-silenced group compared with an siRNA-negative control in the presence of IL-13 (P ¼ .007) and
decreased by 30% in the absence of IL-13 (P ¼ .006) (Fig.
3C). These results suggest that IL-13 signals through
IL13Ra2 and promotes ACC cell invasion. In addition,
there was a 28.5% to 33% decrease in cell proliferation after days 11 and 14 of IL13Ra2 knockdown compared with
negative controls (P < .001) (Fig. 3D).

Because IL13Ra2 is overexpressed in ACC, we evaluated
its potential as a therapeutic target for ACC in vitro and
in vivo. The sensitivity of 2 ACC cell lines (NCI-H295R
with high IL13Ra2 expression and SW13 with low
IL13Ra2 expression) to a highly specific immunotoxin
(IL-13-PE) was determined (Fig. 4A). In addition, the
renal cell carcinoma cell line PM-RCC, which has high
IL13Ra2 mRNA expression, was used as a positive control. The IC50 for IL-13-PE was significantly lower (1.3
ng/mL and 0.2 ng/mL) in NCI-H295R and PM-RCC
cells, respectively, with high IL13Ra2 expression (Fig.
4B) than the IC50 of 600 ng/mL in SW13 cells, which
have lower IL13Ra2 expression (P < .05) (Fig. 4C). The
IC50 of IL-13-PE also was administered in negative control and siRNA-transfected cells to evaluate the specificity
of IL-13-PE to IL13Ra2. The treatment resulted in loss
of sensitivity in siRNA-transfected cells compared with

using a protein synthesis inhibition assay and was significantly lower in the negative control and untreated groups
(0.9 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL) compared with the siRNA-treated
group (1000 ng/mL; P < .05) (Fig. 4E).
To further confirm the cytotoxic effect of IL-13-PE in
a 3-dimensional model that mimics solid tumors better, it
also was administered to NCI-H295R tumor spheroids.
NCI-H295R cells were cultured for 1 week to form spheroids; then, the spheroids were treated with different concentrations of IL-13-PE for 2 weeks. We observed a significant
reduction in the spheroid size and disaggregation of cells
during treatment within 1 week of treatment (Fig. 4F).

cells, and treatment was initiated after the tumors reached
a size of approximately 50 to 60 mm3. After 14 days, the
mice were randomized into 5 groups. The routes of IL13-PE administration were all well tolerated with no
observed toxicity on histologic examination of vital organs
(liver, kidney, spleen, and lung). In addition, there was no
significant difference in weight between the groups. Nineteen days after treatment, mice with 1 week and 2 weeks

Day 25 compared with the vehicle control group (Group
V; P < .05) (Fig. 5B). We also observed significantly longer survival in Groups I, II, and III (108 days, 106 days,

and V (69 days and 84 days, respectively; P < .05). In
addition, histologic analysis in the intraperitoneal and

therapeutic target. IL13Ra2 knockdown in ACC cells
resulted in the suppression of invasion, suggesting that it
may influence cell-invasive phenotype in ACC. Our data
also demonstrate that IL13Ra2 is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ACC with IL-13-PE.
Our study demonstrates IL13Ra2 mRNA and protein overexpression in ACC, as has been observed in other
malignancies.12,14,16,27,29,30 It is noteworthy that
IL13Ra2 mRNA expression was lower in tumors from a
cohort of patients with metastatic and recurrent ACC
who received prior systemic chemotherapy before undergoing surgical resection, but expression levels still were
well over 5-fold higher than levels in normal adrenocortical tissue. These results suggest that IL13Ra2 expression
may vary because of treatment. Thus, because IL13Ra2
expression is low or absent in normal organs, it would be
reasonable to consider IL-13-PE therapy for patients with
metastatic or locally advanced ACC.
Given the overexpression of IL13Ra2 in ACC, we
were interested in evaluating whether the receptor was
functional in ACC. By using siRNA knockdown, the number of invading cells was reduced significantly compared
with negative controls. In addition, incubation of cells with
IL-13 ligand increased invasion compared with the negative
control group, and the effect was lost in IL13Ra2-silenced
cells. Therefore, these results suggest that IL13Ra2 is

involved in ACC invasion and that IL13Ra2 mediates IL13 signaling in NCI-H295R cells. In addition, an invasive
feature (capsular invasion) was observed in the histology of
malignant tumors that had higher IL13Ra2 overexpression.
Previously, it was demonstrated that IL-13 activates AP-1
transcription factor, which, in turn, activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and thereby may influence metastatic potential in pancreatic cancer cells.28 MMPs are
associated with tumor invasion and metastasis of malignant
tumors with different histogenetic origins.31,32 The current
findings also are supported by other studies that reported
elevated IL13Ra2 levels in breast cancer metastasis and glioma cells with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor.28,33,34 Our findings indicate that IL-13 mediates
signaling through IL13Ra2 and influences cellular invasion
and proliferation in ACC cells.
Because of the specific overexpression of IL13Ra2
in ACC and the lack of IL13Ra2 expression in the vast
majority of normal tissues, we were interested in evaluating its role as a therapeutic target. It has been demonstrated that IL-13-PE inhibits the growth of different
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.26,27 We tested the sensitivity and specificity of ACC cell lines to IL-13-PE in
monolayer culture and observed that the IC50 was low in
the IL13Ra2-positive NCI-H295R cell line compared
with SW13, a receptor-negative cell line. In addition, IL5705

Figure 5. Intratumoral (IT) and intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with interleukin-13 (IL-13) conjugated with Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL13-PE) in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) xenografts significantly reduced tumor growth. (A) Tumor growth is compared between
the vehicle-treated and IL-13-PE IT-treated groups (100 lg/kg once daily for 1 week and 2 weeks, as indicated by vertical arrows).
(B) Tumor growth is compared between the vehicle treatment group and the IL-13-PE IP treatment group (50 lg/kg twice daily for
1 week). Each point represents the mean  standard error of the mean for 6 mice from 2 independent experiments. Asterisks indicate statistically significant values (single asterisk, P < .05; double asterisks, P < .01). (C) Tumor histology is illustrated in mice that
had ACC xenografts after treatment with IL-13-PE. These representative hematoxylin and eosin images from (1,2) the IT group and
(3,4) and the IP vehicle group (0.2% human serum albumin) indicate the presence of viable tumor cells; and images of hematoxylin
and eosin-stained sections from mice that received IL-13-PE in (5,6) the IT group (100 l/kg) and (7,8) the IP group (50 lg/kg;)
reveal the presence of few viable cells with necrotic mass (original magnification, 2.5 and 20, as indicated).

13-PE treatment led to a significant decrease in sensitivity
and IC50 in siRNA-transfected cells (1000 ng/mL)
compared with a negative control group (0.9 ng/mL).
These results suggest that IL-13-PE is highly specific to
IL13Ra2. With these encouraging results, we also evaluated sensitivity in 3-dimensional in vitro culture of spheroids to confirm the efficacy of IL-13-PE in ACC. The
spheroid model resembles a solid tumor and is used for
studying therapeutic drug testing, tumor growth, and cellular differentiation and invasion.35,36 Our results
revealed a dramatic effect on tumor spheroids at very low
concentrations of IL-13-PE, confirming the efficacy and
specificity of IL-13-PE to IL13Ra2-positive ACC cells.
5706

On the basis of the positive cytotoxicity results in
monolayer and spheroid culture, IL-13-PE efficacy also
was determined in an in vivo model of subcutaneous xenografts. ACC xenografts were developed using NCIH295R cells, and administration of IL-13-PE through
intratumoral and intraperitoneal routes of injection
resulted in significant reductions (70% and 47%, respectively) in established tumors within 3 weeks with no
observable signs of toxicity. Intratumoral injections probably were more effective because of the direct route of
administration, because longer treatment (higher cumulative dose) with this route of administration resulted in no
significant difference tumor reduction. This result is in

concordance with the previous studies in other IL13Ra2positive tumor types, such as glioma, renal cell carcinoma,
and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.15,17,27,37 In addition,
histologic analysis of the xenograft tumors revealed significant necrosis in tumors that were treated with IL-13-PE,
whereas vehicle-treated tumors had evidence of viable
cells. Thus, as demonstrated in previous studies using IL13-PE–based immunotoxin, our results indicate that this
agent causes cell death and tumor necrosis.38-40
In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study
to demonstrate that IL13Ra2 is overexpressed in ACC
and is a novel therapeutic target for ACC. IL-13-PE
immunotoxin is specific to IL13Ra2 and significantly
inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in a human xenograft
ACC animal model. Therefore, our results suggest that
IL13Ra2 may be used as novel target and support the testing of IL-13-PE immunotoxin in a clinical trial among
patients with advanced and metastatic ACC.
