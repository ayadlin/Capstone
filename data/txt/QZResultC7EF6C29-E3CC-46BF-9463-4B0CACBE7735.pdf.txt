Abstract
A phase I trial of ABT-888 (veliparib), a PARP inhibitor, in combination with topotecan, a topoisomerase
I–targeted agent, was carried out to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and
pharmacodynamics of the combination in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas. Varying
schedules and doses of intravenous topotecan in combination with ABT-888 (10 mg) administered orally twice a
day (BID) were evaluated. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetics were assessed and levels of poly(ADP-ribose)
(PAR) and the DNA damage marker gH2AX were measured in tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC). Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Significant myelosuppression limited the ability to coadminister
ABT-888 with standard doses of topotecan, necessitating dose reductions. Preclinical studies using athymic
mice carrying human tumor xenografts also informed schedule changes. The MTD was established as topotecan
0.6 mg/m2/d and ABT-888 10 mg BID on days one to five of 21-day cycles. Topotecan did not alter the
pharmacokinetics of ABT-888. A more than 75% reduction in PAR levels was observed in 3 paired tumor biopsy
samples; a greater than 50% reduction was observed in PBMCs from 19 of 23 patients with measurable levels.
Increases in gH2AX response in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and PBMCs were observed in patients receiving
ABT-888 with topotecan. We show a mechanistic interaction of a PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, with a topoisomerase I
inhibitor, topotecan, in PBMCs, tumor, and CTCs. Results of this trial reveal that PARP inhibition can modulate the
capacity to repair topoisomerase I–mediated DNA damage in the clinic. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5626–34. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
PARP enzymes are involved in the recognition of DNA
damage and the facilitation of DNA repair. Inhibition of PARP
activity is a promising approach for enhancing the DNAdamaging effects of chemotherapeutic agents (1, 2). PARP
inhibitors in clinical development have generated considerable interest for patients whose tumors are driven by BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutations, based on reports of increased sensitivity of
homozygous BRCA-deficient cells to PARP inhibition (3, 4).
ABT-888 (veliparib) is a potent, orally administered small
molecule inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2. In preclinical

models, ABT-888 potentiates the antitumor activity of multiple cytotoxic agents, including topoisomerase I–targeted inhibitors (5). PARP inhibition prevents efficient repair of DNA
damage induced by camptothecins (6–10). Therefore, we
hypothesized that coadministration of ABT-888 with topotecan would enhance the antitumor activity of this topoisomerase I inhibitor.
We conducted a phase I trial of ABT-888 combined with
topotecan hydrochloride in patients with advanced, refractory
solid tumors and lymphomas. The objectives were to establish
the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
the combination of ABT-888 with topotecan; to evaluate the
pharmacokinetics of each agent alone and in combination;
and to determine the effects of the study treatment on the
level of PARP activity and DNA damage in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC), circulating tumor cells (CTC), and
tumor biopsy samples.

Prior anticancer therapy must have been completed at least
4 weeks prior to enrollment. Prior therapy with a PARP
inhibitor was allowed. Patients were excluded if they had
an uncontrolled intercurrent illness or were pregnant or
lactating.
This trial was conducted under a National Cancer Institute
(NCI)-sponsored IND with Institutional Review Board
approval. The protocol design and conduct complied with
all applicable regulations, guidance, and local policies.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00553189.
Trial design
This was an open-label, single-arm phase I study of the
combination of ABT-888 administered orally with topotecan
hydrochloride administered intravenously in patients with
advanced malignancies. ABT-888 was supplied under a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement between the
Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, and Abbott
Laboratories, Inc. Topotecan was obtained from commercial
sources.
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
of each agent alone compared with the combination, we
initially evaluated a schedule of topotecan administered alone
on day 8, followed a week later by ABT-888 administered
twice a day (BID) on days 1 to 7, and topotecan on days 2 to 5
for cycle 1. Starting on cycle 2, ABT-888 was administered on
days 1 to 7 and topotecan on days 1 to 5 (21-day cycle; Fig. 1,

schedule A). The starting dose was topotecan 1.2 mg/m2/d
and ABT-888 10 mg BID (dose level 1; Table 1). However, we
observed grade 4 myelosuppression at this dose level, initially
necessitating dose reduction of topotecan to 0.9 mg/m2/d
with ABT-888 10 mg BID, followed by a revision of the drug
administration schedule. We hypothesized that administering
a dose of topotecan a week before giving 4 additional days of
topotecan with 5 days of ABT-888 may be priming bone
marrow progenitors, increasing the likelihood of myelosuppression (11). Therefore, we revised the schedule to administer
topotecan on days 1 to 5 and ABT-888 on days 2 to 5 in cycle 1
and then gave both drugs together on days 1 to 5 in subsequent cycles (21-day cycles; Fig. 1, schedule B). The topotecan dose was reduced to 0.75 mg/m2/d. However, we again
observed grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression, resulting in reduction of the topotecan dose to 0.6 mg/m2/d given on days 1 to 5
(dose level 3). This dose level was well tolerated. Because of
the clinical toxicities, human xenograft model studies were
carried out indicating that delivering 1 day of ABT-888 with
5 days of topotecan produced the same antitumor effect as
5 days of both drugs (Fig. 2). Therefore, to safely escalate the
dose of topotecan, we explored administering topotecan at
0.75 mg/m2/d given on days 1 to 5, with ABT-888 administration on day 1 only in each cycle (21-day cycles; Fig. 1,
schedule C).
Adverse events were graded according to NCI Common
Terminology Criteria version 3.0. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
was defined as an adverse event that occurred in the first 2
cycles (given that the schedules were different between cycles
1 and 2), was believed to be study drug related, and fulfilled
one of the following criteria: grade 3 or higher nonhematologic
toxicity (except for nausea/vomiting and diarrhea without
maximal symptomatic/prophylactic treatment); grade 4

more; or febrile neutropenia. Any degree of anemia, leukopenia in the absence of neutropenia as defined above, or
lymphopenia was not considered dose limiting. Patients were

not allowed to receive prophylactic growth factors for the first
2 cycles.
Three patients were initially enrolled per dose level. Patient
enrollment and dose escalation followed a traditional 3þ3
design. The MTD was defined as the dose at which no more
than 1 of 6 patients or 33% or less experienced a DLT (one dose
level below the dose at which at least 2 of 3 to 6 patients
experienced DLT).
Safety and efficacy evaluations
A complete patient history and physical examination were
conducted at baseline and prior to each cycle. Complete blood
counts with differential and serum chemistries were done at
baseline, weekly for the first 2 cycles, and then prior to each
cycle. More frequent blood counts were done for patients
experiencing grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression to determine
the duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and to
document recovery. Radiographic evaluation was done at
baseline and every 2 cycles to assess for tumor response based
on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST
1.0; ref. 12).

(1.5 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection once a day for 5
consecutive days (QD5) starting on study day 9. ABT-888 (3.13 mg/kg)
was administered orally starting on study day 9 as follows, relative to
topotecan: 1 hour before the first dose (QD1), first and second doses
(QD2), first, second, and third doses (QD3), and first, second, third,
fourth, and fifth doses (QD5). The antitumor efficacies of the revised dose
schedules (1, 2, or 3 days of ABT-888 administration in combination with
5 days of topotecan), measured on day 31, were not significantly different
from 5 days of ABT-888 administration. Animal weight loss did not exceed
10% in any cohort. Data presented as mean  SD.

Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples (7 mL) for pharmacokinetic analysis were
collected during cycle 1 at baseline prior to drug administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 24 hours postdose on days 8, 1,
and 2 for dose levels 1 and 1; days 1 and 2 for dose levels 2
and 3; and days 1 and 3 for dose level 1A.
A urine sample of 10 mL was collected before drug administration and at every void from 0 to 24 hours postdose on the
same days that blood was collected for pharmacokinetic
analysis.
Total topotecan plasma concentrations were measured by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection as previously described (13). ABT-888

plasma concentrations were measured by an HPLC-based
method (14) modified to include drug isolation by solid-phase
extraction by using a Bond Elut Certify (Varian) column and
fluorescence (excitation, 255 nm and emission, 390 nm)
detection (R. Klecker, personal communication). Additional
details are included in the Supplementary Appendix. Topotecan and ABT-888 plasma concentration–time data were
analyzed by standard noncompartmental methods by using
the program WinNonlin Pro (Pharsight Corp).
Pharmacodynamics
Blood samples for PBMCs were collected in 8-mL Cell Prep
Tubes (Becton Dickinson) before drug treatment and 2, 4, 7,
and 24 hours after drug administration on the first day of
topotecan alone, ABT-888 alone, and the combination. PBMCs
were isolated as previously described (15). A pretreatment
biopsy was obtained just prior to drug administration on
study, and a postdose biopsy was collected 3 to 7 hours after
administration of the combination. Levels of poly(ADP-ribose)
(PAR), a product of PARP, were measured by using a validated
chemiluminescent PAR immunoassay as previously described
(15, 16). Blood samples were also collected pre- and postdosing (day 2 or 5) to examine the effect of the combination on
phosphorylated histone H2AX (gH2AX), a marker for the
formation of DNA double-strand breaks, in CTCs by using a
quantitative, validated assay (17).
gH2AX was also measured in tumor samples by using a
quantitative immunofluorescence assay as previously
described (18). gH2AX in PBMCs was measured as described
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Human tumor xenograft models
Xenograft models were used before and during the trial to
help determine an optimum clinical dosing schedule. The
effects of ABT-888, topotecan, or the combination on tumor
growth were assessed in athymic nude (nu/nu NCr) mice
bearing A375 (topotecan sensitive) human melanoma xenografts as described in the Supplementary Appendix. A375 cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, cultured for less than 6 months, and not reauthenticated.

Results
Patient demographics
A total of 24 patients were enrolled between November 2007
and June 2009 (Table 2). All patients had previously received
prior standard therapy and had evidence of disease progression. In the initial cohorts, most patients had received more
than 5 prior systemic therapies (range 2–14). In light of the
degree of myelosuppression observed, we enrolled less heavily
pretreated patients (3 or fewer prior systemic therapies)
starting with patient 13.
Toxicity
We observed 3 DLTs in the first 6 patients enrolled on dose
level 1 (ABT-888 10 mg BID on days 1 to 7; topotecan 1.2 mg/
m2/d on day 8 and days 2 to 5 in cycle 1 and on days 1 to 5 in
cycle 2 onward; schedule A, Fig. 1). One patient developed

grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, one had grade 4
neutropenia lasting longer than 5 days, and one had febrile
neutropenia. All 6 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression in the first 2 cycles, necessitating a topotecan
dose reduction to dose level 1 (0.9 mg/m2/d). One patient
developed grade 4 neutropenia for longer than 5 days, meeting
the criteria for DLT. Because 2 other patients on this dose level
also developed grade 4 neutropenia (even though it was less
than 5 days in duration), the dose level was not considered
tolerable. The drug administration schedule was revised to
reduce the number of days of ABT-888 dosing, eliminate
treatment on day 8, and further reduce the dose of topotecan (schedule B, Fig. 1). On dose level 2, topotecan (0.75
mg/m2/d) was administered on days 1 to 5 of every cycle, with
ABT-888 (10 mg BID) administered on days 2 to 5 in cycle 1
and days 1 to 5 in cycle 2 onward. Three patients were enrolled
and 2 DLTs were observed, febrile neutropenia and grade 4
neutropenia lasting longer than 5 days. This necessitated a
reduction in topotecan dose to 0.6 mg/m2/d for dose level 3;
3 patients were treated at this dose level, and no DLTs were
observed.
In view of the toxicities observed, we then employed
xenograft models to explore alternative dosing schedules in

an attempt to escalate both agents. Results from these studies
indicated that 1 day of ABT-888 administration (dose of 3.13
mg/kg) with 5 days of topotecan (1.5 mg/kg) produced a
nearly equivalent antitumor effect as 5 days of both drugs
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S1). On the basis of these preclinical data, we amended the trial to evaluate escalating the
dose of topotecan while reducing the duration of ABT-888
administration to 1 day only (schedule C, Fig. 1). Five patients
were enrolled on dose level 1A, and 2 developed grade 4
thrombocytopenia, meeting criteria for DLT. Three additional
patients were enrolled on dose level 3; no DLTs were
observed. Thus, the MTD was established as topotecan 0.6
mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5 and ABT-888 10 mg BID on days 1 to 5
in 21-day cycles.
Efficacy
Four of 6 patients on dose level 1 had stable disease after 2
cycles; however, these patients were taken off study because of
toxicity. One patient with Hurthle cell thyroid cancer received
a total of 33 cycles on dose level 3 with disease stabilization.
One patient (dose level 3) with refractory melanoma
received a total of 14 cycles with disease stabilization. One
patient with colorectal cancer and one with bile duct adenocarcinoma (both on dose level 1A) received total of 6 and 4
cycles, respectively, with disease stabilization.
Pharmacokinetics
The mean ( SD) half-life for topotecan administered alone,
1 week before beginning combination treatment (schedule A),
was 3.6  3.0 hours, with mean ( SD) clearance and steadystate volume of distribution values of 9.2  5.0 L/hr/m2 and
35.1  17.3 L/m2, respectively. The mean ( SD) half-life,
clearance, and steady-state volume of distribution values for
topotecan after administration of ABT-888 were 3.0  1.4
hours, 9.8  5.1 L/hr/m2, and 35.7  16.3 L/m2, respectively.
Topotecan half-life, clearance, and steady-state volume of
distribution values were also not altered by concomitant
administration with ABT-888 in schedules B and C (data
not shown). Topotecan was predominantly excreted in the
urine: 24 hours after intravenous administration, the cumulative urinary recovery of total topotecan (mean  SD) ranged
from 94.1%  29.5% (day 1, n ¼ 11) to 105.1%  16.7% (day 2)
of the administered doses. The mean values ( SD, n ¼ 9) for
maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma
concentration, half-life, and area under the concentrationtime curve extrapolated to infinity for ABT-888 (10 mg, BID)
administered alone in schedule A were 262  80 nmol/L, 1.6
 1.1 hours, 4.4  1.4 hours, and 1,460  450 nmol/L*h,
respectively. When administered with topotecan in schedules
B and C, the values were 255  125 nmol/L, 1.8  0.9 hours,
4.9  1.8 hours, and 1,740  786 nmol/L*h, respectively. Thus,
there was no evidence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between the 2 drugs.
Pharmacodynamics

this trial is included in Supplementary Table S2. PARP was

dules studied and in the majority of patients. Topotecan did
not seem to alter the ability of ABT-888 to inhibit PARP. In
PBMCs, a greater than 50% mean reduction in PAR was
observed after administration of ABT-888 in all dose levels,
except for the level with the highest dose of topotecan (1.2 mg/
m2/d; Fig. 3A). Supplementary Figure S1 shows data by
schedule for the 23 patients with evaluable PBMC PAR levels.
A greater than 75% reduction in PAR levels in tumors was
observed in each of the 3 patients for whom paired tumor
biopsies were available (Fig. 3B); 2 of these patients also had a
greater than 60% reduction in PAR levels in PBMCs. The
baseline PAR level in PBMCs from the third patient was below
the required minimum for analysis.
Levels of gH2AX were measured in PBMCs after administration of topotecan alone and after the combination. One of 3

patients had elevated levels of gH2AX in PBMCs after a dose of
0.75 mg/m2/d topotecan alone, but elevations were not
observed with lower doses. However, after topotecan was
given with ABT-888, PBMCs from 2 of 7 patients on dose
level 3 (0.6 mg/m2/d topotecan) and all 3 patients on dose
level 2 (0.75 mg/m2/d topotecan) showed increases in
gH2AX (Fig. 4A). The increases in gH2AX were small but
tended to be greater with the higher topotecan dose (dose
level 2). By 24 hours after dosing, gH2AX levels had returned
to baseline levels. The two patients on dose level 3 who had
increased gH2AX levels in PBMCs after administration of
ABT-888 with topotecan also had a reduction in PAR in
PBMCs. These patients had a 100% PAR reduction in PBMCs
at 2 hours postdose and 100% and 76.3% reductions at 4 hours
postdose, compared with a 60.2%  29.6% PAR reduction
(mean  SD) at 2 hours postdose for the 5 patients on that
dose level in whom a gH2AX response was not observed (4
hours; 73.5%  22.1%). Paired tumor biopsies from 2 patients,
one on dose level 1 and one on dose level 3, were analyzed
for gH2AX, but no effect of study treatment on gH2AX levels
was measured (data not shown).
Total CTCs and the number of gH2AX-postitive CTCs were
measurable in samples from 4 patients at baseline and after
combined ABT-888 and topotecan treatment (Fig. 5A and B).

www.aacrjournals.org

The percentage of gH2AX-positive CTCs increased in 3 of the 4
patients. The average increase for the 4 patients was 23% (95%
CI: 5–40; the change is nonnegative with 0.06 significance, 1
sided, by the nonparametric sign test). Interestingly, whereas
the patient with the highest total number of CTCs, patient 21,
had a decrease in total CTCs after treatment, this patient had
an increase in the percentage of gH2AX-postitive CTCs. Data
from day 5 were available from one patient (patient 24). For
this patient, the fraction of CTCs positive for gH2AX increased
from 16% at baseline to 100% by day 5, whereas the number of
CTCs remained constant.

Discussion
This trial evaluated the toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and
pharmacodynamics of ABT-888, a potent PARP inhibitor, in
combination with a topoisomerase I inhibitor in clinical

definition of DLT included drug-related adverse events that
occurred in the first 2 cycles (given that the schedules were
different between cycles 1 and 2). As 6 evaluable patients
received at least 2 cycles without DLT at dose level 3,
which included the regimen of a full 5 days of dosing of both
ABT-888 and topotecan starting with cycle 2, this regimen

was established as the MTD (topotecan administered intravenously at 0.6 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5 and ABT-888 given
orally at 10 mg BID on days 1 to 5, in 21-day cycles).
Myelosuppression was the principal toxicity on this trial,
which is consistent with the severe neutropenia in 65% to
75% of courses and severe thrombocytopenia in 25% to 30%
of courses when topotecan is administered to patients with
lung or ovarian cancer at FDA-approved doses of 1.5 mg/m2/
d for 5 days with 2 dose reductions allowed to 1 mg/m2/d
(19, 20). Combination trials of topotecan with other cytotoxics such as cisplatin have required dose reduction of
topotecan to 0.75 mg/m2/d or lower (21). Because of the
degree of myelosuppression observed with topotecan alone,
especially in heavily pretreated patients, it is difficult to draw
conclusions about the contribution of ABT-888 to the toxicity of the combination regimen.
We used preclinical models during the conduct of the trial
to evaluate our clinical observations and to revise the trial
design. Although preclinical models indicated a better safety

profile for 1 day of ABT-888 in combination with 5 days of
topotecan, we were unable to dose escalate topotecan in the
clinic by reducing the number of days of ABT-888. It seems
likely that a major reason for our difficulty in translating the
results of our modeling of the ABT-888 plus topotecan combination in A375 melanoma xenografts to the clinic is the
remarkable tolerance of mouse (versus human) bone marrow
progenitors to topotecan (22).
One important question in developing PARP modulators is
whether coadministration of a PARP inhibitor with reduced
doses of topotecan results in superior benefit-to-risk profiles
than full doses of topotecan alone. Enhanced normal tissue
toxicity has been an important consideration in combination
trials of PARP inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapies,
requiring chemotherapeutic dose reductions (23, 24). As
exemplified by our trial and trials with other PARP inhibitors
in combination with chemotherapy, it has been difficult to
define an optimum combination dose and schedule that
would improve the therapeutic ratio. This could not be
addressed in the current phase I dose escalation study because
of a relatively small number of patients with a variety of
refractory tumors. On the basis of our recent study in cancer
cell lines with XPF-ERCC1 inactivation, it is possible that the
potential benefit of using PARP inhibitors and topoisomerase
I–targeted drugs will be seen in tumor cells with preexisting
DNA repair deficiencies (10). To determine the effect of
underlying genetic defects in the DNA repair pathways, such
as ATM, ATR, BRCA, XRCC, XPF, and Fanconi anemia pathway, we are conducting this analysis in tumor samples from
patients in our ongoing trial of the combination of ABT-888
with cyclophosphamide.
This is the first clinical study showing significant reduction
in PAR levels (more than 75%) in all 3 paired tumor biopsies
compared with baseline after administration of ABT-888 at
10 mg. Similar reductions were also observed in PBMCs.
Whether this degree of PARP inhibition is sufficient (or a
higher degree of inhibition is needed) to derive clinical benefit
is currently unknown, making it difficult to define the "optimal
biologic dose" of ABT-888 in combination with chemotherapy.
Escalating the PARP inhibitor dose to the MTD may not be
necessary to derive clinical benefit, especially given the narrow
therapeutic index of certain combination regimens.
As previously reported in our phase 0 study of ABT-888 (15),
tumor cells are more sensitive to PARP inhibition than
PBMCs. Therefore, we evaluated the number of CTCs and
the presence of gH2AX in these tumor cells as a marker of drug
effect on tumor. gH2AX is a sensitive marker of DNA damage
(18, 25). We hypothesized that increased DNA damage caused
by the addition of an inhibitor of DNA repair, ABT-888, to
topotecan could produce a measurable increase in gH2AX
levels in surrogate tissue and tumor (10). We observed an
increase in gH2AX in PBMCs after treatment with the combination of ABT-888 and topotecan when compared with
topotecan alone. We did not observe a change in gH2AX in
the 2 paired tumor biopsies examined. The lack of increased
gH2AX in tumor biopsy samples may reflect an actual absence
of effect on the level of DNA damage in tumor, given the low
dose of topotecan administered, or the fact that tumor biopsy

Phase I Trial of ABT-888 with Topotecan

timing was optimized to observe effects on PAR levels, and not
gH2AX levels, which are transient.
CTCs offer a relatively noninvasive way to repeatedly sample tumor cells over time, allowing assessment of dynamic
markers. An increase in gH2AX in CTCs following administration of topotecan has been previously reported by our
group (17). In the current trial, we detected an increase in
the fraction of CTCs positive for gH2AX in 3 of 4 patients for
whom CTC data were available after administration of the
combination of topotecan with ABT-888 (Fig. 5). In the only
patient in whom posttreatment samples were obtained at
day 5 (following completion of all doses of study drugs),
gH2AX levels increased from 16% at baseline to 100%, suggesting an appreciable DNA damage response to drug treatment.
This is the first clinical trial showing an increase in a marker of
DNA damage in CTCs following administration of the combination of a PARP inhibitor with chemotherapy. The significance of these findings will be explored in further clinical
trials. The actual number of CTCs collected (less than 10 at all
time points in 3 of 4 patients) illustrates one of the major
challenges for the wider application of CTCs to assess drug
effect on target (Fig. 5B). Thus, newer technologies for CTC
capture, which have been reported to substantially increase
the number of CTCs harvested from a patient, could have a
great impact on the future utility of CTCs as pharmacodynamic markers in clinical trials.
We investigated varying schedules of ABT-888 administration with topotecan in xenograft models after encountering
toxicities with the initial schedule. Efficacy was equivalent
whether ABT-888 was administered for 1 to 2 days or 5 days
(with shorter treatment being better tolerated). This raises the
question of the duration of exposure to PARP inhibitors
necessary to derive clinical benefit. Ongoing clinical trials
investigating combinations of PARP inhibitors with cytotoxic
chemotherapies commonly evaluate multiple days of PARP
inhibitor administration before, during, and after chemotherapy, in an attempt to increase DNA damage and delay DNA
repair. The xenograft experiments carried out during this trial
challenge the dogma that more is better. Issues such as
chronic versus intermittent schedules and optimal sequencing

based on kinetics of DNA damage caused by the cytotoxic
agent need to be explored further in clinical trials to maximize
clinical benefit while ensuring patient safety. Further characterization of tumor-specific genetic defects in DNA repair
and checkpoint pathways might also reveal the patients whose
tumors will respond best to a combination of PARP- and
topoisomerase I–targeted therapies.
Enhancing the therapeutic ratio between tumor cell killing
and bone marrow toxicity for the combination of ABT-888 and
topotecan will require evaluation of multiple, pharmacodynamically driven treatment schedules in the clinic. However,
to our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial showing a
mechanistic interaction between a PARP inhibitor and a
topoisomerase I inhibitor in PBMCs, tumor, and CTCs. Results
of this trial show that a PARP inhibitor can modulate the
capacity to repair topoisomerase I–mediated DNA damage in
the clinic.
