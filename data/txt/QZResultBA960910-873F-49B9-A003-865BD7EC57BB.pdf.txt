Abstract
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Tumour metastasis is a complex process involving reciprocal interplay between cancer cells and
host stroma at both primary and secondary sites, and is strongly influenced by microenvironmental
factors such as hypoxia1. Tumour-secreted proteins play a crucial role in these interactions2–5 and
present strategic therapeutic potential. Metastasis of breast cancer to the bone affects
approximately 85% of patients with advanced disease and renders them largely untreatable6.
Specifically, osteolytic bone lesions, where bone is destroyed, lead to debilitating skeletal
complications and increased patient morbidity and mortality6,7. The molecular interactions
governing the early events of osteolytic lesion formation are currently unclear. Here we show
hypoxia to be specifically associated with bone relapse in ER-negative breast cancer patients.
Global quantitative analysis of the hypoxic secretome identified Lysyl Oxidase (LOX) as
significantly associated with bone-tropism and relapse. High expression of LOX in primary breast
tumours or systemic delivery of LOX leads to osteolytic lesion formation whereas silencing or
inhibition of LOX activity abrogates tumour-driven osteolytic lesion formation. We identify LOX
as a novel regulator of NFATc1-driven osteoclastogenesis, independent of RANK Ligand, which
disrupts normal bone homeostasis leading to the formation of focal pre-metastatic lesions. We
show that these lesions subsequently provide a platform for circulating tumour cells to colonise

Using a primary tumour hypoxic signature8, retrospective analysis of a cohort of lymphnode-negative breast cancer patients who received no systemic adjuvant therapy9 revealed a
significant association with metastasis specifically within oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative
(ER-) but not ER-positive (ER+) patients (Fig. 1a). Moreover, analysis of metastatic site
showed significant association with bone metastases over lung, liver and brain (Fig. 1b and
Extended Data Fig. 1a). We performed global differential quantitative mass-spectrometrybased proteomic analysis of the hypoxic secretome associated with osteotropism using the
human ER- MDA-MB-231 parent and matched bone tropic (clone 1833) (MDA-BT)10
breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1c). LOX was one of the most highly upregulated secreted
proteins in MDA-BT cells (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Information 1 and Extended Data Fig.
1b–d). Querying the publically available data sets for the full panel of MDA-MB-231 clonal
lines10, which exhibit differing levels of osteotropism, we found LOX was significantly
associated with increasing osteotropism (Fig. 1e). LOX has previously been strongly
implicated in cancer metastasis3,11–13, identifying it as an important candidate for further
investigation.

Retrospective analysis of LOX in our patient cohort9 confirmed it is significantly associated
with metastasis in ER- patients but not ER+ breast cancer patients (Extended Data Fig. 2a,
b), consistent with previous reports13. Furthermore LOX is significantly associated with
reported bone relapse across all patients and ER-, but not ER+, patients (Fig. 1f). Coxregression analysis showed LOX is associated with increased hazard ratio in ER- patients for
metastasis in general and bone relapse (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis showed LOX is indicative of metastatic dissemination
(including to the bone) in ER- but not ER+ breast cancer (Extended Data Fig. 3a).
Importantly, our observations were confirmed in a second data set14 (Extended Data Fig.
3b). Our findings strongly implicate LOX in bone metastases in ER- breast cancer patients.
We further investigated our findings in the immune-competent 4T1-BALB/c syngeneic
model of spontaneously metastasizing ER- breast cancer which expresses high levels of
LOX3,13 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The MDA-MB-231 lines are not suitable as a progression
model since bone metastases do not occur from orthotopic implantation. Micro-computed
tomography (micro-CT) analysis of bones from 4T1 tumour-bearing mice showed decreased
trabecular and cortical bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, and
increased focal osteolytic lesions over time (Fig. 2a–c and Extended Data Fig. 4b–e).
Significant changes were detectable from 2 weeks after implantation when tumour hypoxia
is a salient feature (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Bone marrow explants and quantitative PCR
with reverse transcription (qRT–PCR) confirmed osteolytic lesion formation preceded the

arrival of tumour cells (Extended Data Fig. 4g–i). Strikingly, osteolytic lesion formation and
cortical bone loss were also induced in a tumour-free model through injection of hypoxic
tumour-conditioned media (‘CM’) (Fig. 2b, c)3. Our data show early osteolytic lesions are
formed in the absence of tumour cells by hypoxia-induced tumour-secreted factors.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To determine LOX-dependency, mice were implanted with 4T1shLOX tumours, with
decreased LOX expression and decreased LOX in sera (Extended Data Figs 4a and 5a).
Micro-CT analysis revealed decreased osteolytic lesions in these mice (Fig. 2d, e), with no
effect on primary tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Immunological inhibition of LOX
in 4T1 scrambled control (4T1scr) tumour-bearing mice with our antibody that binds
specifically to LOX12 and blocks enzymatic function13, also decreased focal osteolytic
lesion formation (Fig. 2f). Consistently, in tumour-free models, injection of 4T1shLOX CM
generated fewer focal osteolytic lesions than 4T1scr CM (Fig. 2g).
We confirmed our findings in another, previously published human colorectal cancer model
with manipulated LOX expression15. SW480 is a non-metastatic colorectal cancer cell line
with low LOX expression, whose metastatic ability is increased by overexpression of wildtype LOX (+LOX) but not a catalytically inactive mutant (K320A) (+mutLOX)15.
SW480+LOX CM injection showed increased frequency and size of osteolytic lesions
compared with SW480+mutLOX or SW480+EV CMs (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 5c).
While bone metastases in patients with colorectal cancer are rare, our data show that high
levels of secreted active LOX drive focal osteolytic lesion formation in the bone
independently of tumour presence across multiple cancer types. Injection of recombinant
LOX (rLOX) into both immune-compromised nude and immune-competent BALB/c mice
also led to the formation of focal osteolytic lesions (Fig. 2i) and increased circulating
carboxy terminal telopeptide (CTX), a biomarker of bone turnover (Extended Data Fig. 5d).
Our data clearly demonstrate tumour-secreted LOX as a mediator of osteolytic lesions.

Bone homeostasis is a balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation
by osteoblasts. This balance is typically disrupted in cancer metastasis. Addition of rLOX
(in the absence of RANK ligand (RANKL)) to pre-osteoclast cultures was a highly effective
stimulator of osteoclastogenesis, generating greater numbers of osteoclasts (Fig. 3a) with a
higher resorptive capacity than RANKL-stimulated cultures (Fig. 3b, c). Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for RANKL in rLOX-treated culture supernatants showed
no RANKL, ruling out autocrine production of RANKL, and mass spectrometry analysis of
rLOX preparations excluded the presence of contaminating effectors (Extended Data Fig. 6a,
b). Our data show LOX can stimulate the generation of fully differentiated, active osteoclasts
independently of RANKL.
Osteoclastogenesis is driven by the nuclear translocation of NFATc1, the master regulator of
osteoclastogenesis16. Addition of rLOX (in the absence of RANKL) induced greater nuclear
localization of NFATc1 than RANKL (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6c), which was
disrupted by treatment with our LOX-targeting antibody in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
3e and Extended Data Fig. 6c). A by-product of LOX activity is the reactive oxygen species
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Reactive oxygen species have previously been suggested to
influence osteoclast differentiation and function17,18. Treatment of human pre-osteoclast

cultures with rLOX in the presence of catalase (which rapidly degrades H2O2) abrogated
rLOX-driven NFATc1 nuclear localization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3f). Our data
identifies a novel, LOX-activity-dependent mechanism of de novo osteoclastogenesis which
occurs independently of RANKL. Addition of rLOX to primary calvarial mouse osteoblasts
decreased proliferation and led to an increase in terminal differentiation, which was
attenuated by our LOX blocking antibody (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Similarly,
high LOX 4T1scr CM decreased proliferation and increased differentiation of the human
osteoblast SaOS-2 cell line (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f), which was attenuated by treatment
with our LOX antibody. Our data show LOX leads to a loss of proliferative phenotype and
increased terminal differentiation of osteoblasts.
Consistent with LOX tipping the balance of bone homeostasis in the favour of osteoclast
resorption, quantification of osteoblasts and osteoclasts on the endocortical surface of tibiae
from tumour-bearing mice showed decreased osteoblast and increased osteoclast number in
4T1scr tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 3h–j). Partial reversion was evident in mice treated with
our LOX antibody and in mice bearing 4T1shLOX tumours (Fig. 3h–m and Extended Data
Fig. 7a). Thus, tumour-secreted LOX is an important modulator of bone homeostasis.
Treatment of tumour-bearing and CM-injected mice with clinically relevant concentrations
of the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid abrogated focal osteolytic lesion formation (Fig. 4a–
c) without affecting primary tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Our data highlight the
potential for therapeutic intervention of LOX-mediated osteoclast-driven pre-metastatic
lesion formation in the bone.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The functional consequence of LOX-mediated pre-metastatic focal osteolytic lesion
formation was tested by pre-conditioning BALB/c mice with either 4T1scr CM with or
without LOX antibody, or 4T1shLOX CM to stimulate focal osteolytic lesion formation. 4T1
luciferase-expressing tumour cells (4T1Luc) were then injected intracardially.
Bioluminescent IVIS imaging and micro-CT analysis revealed increased tumour burden in
4T1scr CM-conditioned mice compared with LOX antibody treated or 4T1shLOX CMconditioned mice (Fig. 4d–f). A Pearson correlation coefficient showed a positive correlation
between IVIS signal and lesion number (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Our data demonstrate that
LOX-mediated pre-metastatic focal osteolytic lesions generate niches within the bone
microenvironment that support colonization of circulating tumour cells and the formation of
overt bone metastases. Treatment with bisphosphonate during 4T1scr CM conditioning of
mice significantly reduced the ability of intracardially injected 4T1Luc cells to colonize the
bone 1 week after injection and to develop bone metastases 5 weeks after injection (Fig. 4g,
h). Thus, bisphosphonate treatment of patients with high-LOX-expressing tumours after
surgery could prevent the establishment and growth of circulating tumour cells within the
bone.
Pre-metastatic preparation of secondary sites to facilitate subsequent tumour cell
colonization has been reported by us and others3,4,19 in several organs across multiple
cancers; however, so far, the formation of pre-metastatic focal osteolytic lesions directly by
tumour-secreted factors has not been described. We are the first to demonstrate, to our
knowledge, that LOX activity modulates bone homeostasis, acting directly on osteoblasts
and osteoclasts (Fig. 4i). Global bone loss before tumour cell arrival has been previously

linked to indirect effects of tumour-secreted factors through RANKL-dependent
mechanisms20. We present a novel mechanism of deregulation of bone homeostasis
independent of RANKL, yet acknowledge that other factors probably contribute to this
inherently complex process. Interestingly, the post-translationally cleaved LOX propeptide,
known for its opposing inhibitory effects to that of the mature LOX enzyme21, has been
reported to modulate osteoblast behaviour through an intracellular mechanism inhibiting
mineralization ability22. Yet embryonic day (E)18.5 Lox-/- mice exhibit markedly decreased
mineral nodule formation and osteoblast differentiation23, supporting our data and
suggesting context-dependent effects. LOX is reportedly expressed in osteoblasts and
induced by TGF-β released during bone resorption24, which could further stimulate
osteoclastogenesis leading to unbalanced coupling of bone homeostasis and focal osteolytic
lesions. Since LOX-dependent pre-metastatic lesions form in the bone at the same time as
those formed in the lungs and liver3, we believe that these osteolytic lesions are
independent, forming simultaneously through unrelated mechanisms.
Our data suggest LOX may well be a useful marker for predicting the likelihood of
metastases to the bone in ER- breast cancer patients and identifying these patients for
adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment. Our data highlight that the dosing and administration of
LOX inhibitors under development will be critical as genetic targeting yielded more potent
effects than our antibody in this study, and earlier work has shown that treatment with the
non-specific LOX inhibitor β-aminopropionitrile can reduce bone colonization in
intracardiac models when administered at the time of inoculation25. In summary, our insight
into the very early mechanisms of bone metastases before, and independent of tumour cell
arrival, identifies a new step in bone metastasis and novel opportunities for therapeutic
intervention.

Methods
For in vivo experiments, sample size was estimated to be eight mice per treatment group to
ensure more than 80% power with 95% confidence, based on 25% practical difference and
15% coefficient of variation.
Patient data analysis
Evaluation of the expression of a previously published hypoxic signature8 and LOX with
respect to metastasis and organ specific relapse was conducted using a published cohort of
344 primary breast cancers from lymph-node-negative patients who had not received
systemic adjuvant therapy and with available gene expression data and site of relapse
information. Details on patients and gene expression analysis can be found in ref. 9. P values
were derived from a Mann–Whitney test and were two-tailed. An additional Kruskal–Wallis
test between reported bone relapse, relapse elsewhere and no relapse patients with an
additional contrast test wherein all pairwise groups were considered was conducted for LOX
expression. Cox-regression using log2(LOX expression data) was used to estimate the hazard
ratio in two analyses. One analysis used the no-relapse patients and the bone relapse
patients, and the second analysis included all patients. An alternative second patient data

Unless stated otherwise in the following sections, all cell lines were routinely cultured in
DMEM with 100 U ml-1 penicillin and 100 mg ml-1 streptomycin, plus 10% FBS. For CM
collection experiments, cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM without phenol red and
incubated at either 21% oxygen (normoxia) or 1% oxygen (hypoxia) for 24 h in a
Hypoxystation (Don Whitley Scientific). All CMs were filtered before use. For SILAC for
mass spectrometry studies, tumour cells were grown in DMEM containing labelled isotopic
amino acids, either light isotope (12C-,14N-arginine; 12C-,14N-lysine) (R0/K0) or heavy
isotope (13C-,15N-arginine; 13C-,15N-lysine) (R10/K8) for five passages before
incorporation was assessed. A minimum of 97–98% labelled arginine and lysine
incorporation, with less than 1% proline conversion, was required for subsequent proteomics
studies. The MDA-MB-231 BT cell line was obtained from J. Massague at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The 4T1 wild-type cell line was obtained from F. Miller at
the University of Michigan. The SaOS-2 cell line was obtained from J. Gallagher at
Liverpool University. The MDA-MB-231 parental cell line was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (distributed by LGC Standards), where cell lines are
authenticated on a regular basis. The 4T1Luc line was from SibTech. The 4T1 wild-type cell
line was used to generate the 4T1shLOX line as previously published3. The SW480+EV,
+LOX and +mutLOX cell lines were previously generated and authenticated using short
tandem repeat analysis26. All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma and tested
negative for murine pathogens by IMPACT testing (IDEXX Laboratories).

After collection, label-free and SILAC-labelled CMs were filtered and reduced in volume
using 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off filters. The remaining protein was dissolved in 6 M
urea, 2 M thiourea and 10 mM HEPES pH 8, after which exact protein amounts were
determined using a Bradford assay. In SILAC-labelled repeats, the two SILAC labels
(R10/K8 and R0/K0) were mixed 1:1. In label-free repeats, the samples were left unmixed as
depicted in Fig. 1c, but equal amounts of starting material were used for processing. Proteins
were reduced in 1 mM DTT (Sigma) for 45 min at room temperature (21°C), alkylated for
45 min using 5.5 mM chloroacetamide (Sigma), and digested with 1:50 (enzyme:protein
ratio) of mass spectrometry (MS)-grade trypsin (Sigma) overnight at 37°C. Peptides were
acidified with trifluoroacetic acid at a final concentration of 2%, and 5 mg of peptides were
loaded onto a 50 cm C18 reverse-phase analytical column (Thermo EasySpray ES803) using
an EASY nanoLC 1000. Peptides were eluted over a 4 h gradient ranging from 6 to 60% of
80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and the Q-Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was run
in a DD-MS2 top10 method. Full MS spectra were collected at a resolution of 70,000, with
an AGC target of 3 x 106 or maximum injection time of 20 ms and a scan range of 300–1750
m/z. The MS2 spectra were obtained at a resolution of 17,500, with an AGC target value of
1 x 106 or maximum injection time of 60 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 45 s, and ions
with a charge state <2 or unknown were excluded. MS performance was verified for
consistency by running complex cell lysate quality control standards, and chromatography

was monitored to check for reproducibility. Raw data were processed using MaxQuant
version 1.5 and Perseus version 1.4. Results were analysed using scripts written in-house in
Python, and statistically tested for significance using the quantile function in the R statistical
framework. To ensure high confidence identifications and quantification, a MaxQuant score
of >50 and a minimum of two unique peptides per protein seen by tandem MS in all repeats
were required. Initial analysis was undertaken using a label-free approach (two repeats) for
global pairwise analyses, and data subsequently validated in a standard and reverse-label
SILAC approach (two repeats). Identified intracellular contaminants were removed and
secreted proteins retained by using the cellular compartment annotations in Ensembl and
PantherDB, and Gene Ontology annotation enrichment for extracellular-associated terms.

Microarray data analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells
Previously published microarray data for parental and in vivo selected osteotropic subclones
of the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer line were retrieved (GEO accession number

mildly or strongly osteotropic10. All data sets were normalized and centred to the median of

Before the start of experiments, mice were randomly allocated into cages. Each mouse
within the same cage received the same treatment. Cages were subsequently randomly
allocated for treatment. Sample size was estimated to be eight mice per treatment group to
ensure >80% power with 95% confidence, based on 25% practical difference and 15%
coefficient of variation. For tumour-bearing studies, 2 x 105 4T1scr or 4T1shLOX or
4T1Luc cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female BALB/c mice
(Taconic). The tumour-free model has been previously described3, where 300 μl of tumourcell CM is injected intraperitoneally daily into mice for 3 weeks. Rabbit anti-LOX (aLOX)
antibody or rabbit IgG control treatments were administered intraperitoneally twice a week
at 1 mg kg-1 2 days after implantation. The LOX antibody (synthesized by OpenBiosystems)
targets a conserved peptide sequence from the active site of human and mouse proteins,
blocking function as previously described13, and has been shown not to bind other LOX
family members12. For bisphosphonate studies, 0.6 mg kg-1 zoledronic acid was injected
intraperitoneally twice a week. Primary tumour measurements were performed twice a week
using calipers. All experiments were performed in accordance with UK Home Office
regulations following UK Coordinating Committee for Cancer Research Guidelines for the
Welfare and Use of Animals in Cancer Research, or under authorization and guidance from
the Danish Inspectorate for Animal Experimentation. Cell line sources are stated above in
‘In vitro culturing of tumour cells’ and were tested negative for murine pathogens by
IMPACT testing (IDEXX Laboratories). A second previously published human model of
colorectal cancer with manipulated LOX expression15 was used to validate LOX-dependent
findings. SW480 is a non-metastatic colorectal cancer cell line with low LOX expression,

Eight-week-old female nude mice (Charles River) were injected daily with 300 μl
SW480+EV (empty vector), SW480+LOX (full-length active LOX) or SW480+mutLOX

LOX (OriGene Technologies) in PBS was injected twice a week (25 μg kg-1)
intraperitoneally into 8-week-old female nude (Charles River) or BALB/c mice (Taconic) for
3 weeks. Exclusion criteria for data analysis were pre-established such that those mice
terminated before defined experimental endpoints for ethical and/or licence reasons such as
undue pain, suffering, distress and/or apparent lasting harm, or unexpected premature death,

Micro-CT imaging of tibia
Legs were removed from euthanized mice and fixed in either 4% paraformaldehyde solution
or periodate–lysine–paraformaldehyde fixative. Fixed bones were dissected free of tissue
and scanned on a micro-CT scanner (model 1172 Skyscan) at 50 kV with a 0.5 aluminium
filter using a detection pixel size of 5 μm. The scanned images were reconstructed using
Skyscan Recon software and analysed using Skyscan CT analysis software. A standard
trabecular volume of interest was chosen starting 0.2 mm from the growth plate and included
all trabeculae in a 1 mm3 region of bone. Trabecular volume and number were assessed in
this region. Total bone volume was also determined in a length of the bone from the top of
the epiphysis to 3 mm below. Osteolytic lesions were measured through 360° of the bone on
a three-dimensional model in a 3 mm length of cortical bone, starting at the growth plate.
Holes smaller than 50 μm in diameter were excluded from the analysis as these represent
normal physiological structures in bone. During analysis, investigators were blinded to
specific treatment groups.

In vivo quantitation of osteoblast and osteoclast number
Tibiae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, decalcified in 14.3% EDTA for 4 days
at 37°C with daily changes of EDTA, then embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were cut (at 3
μm) using a Leica Microsystems Microtome and stained with tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP) as described previously27. The numbers of osteoblasts and TRAPpositive osteoclasts were determined on a 3 mm length of endocortical surface starting 0.25
mm from the growth plate and viewed on a DMRB microscope (Leica Microsystems). All
histomorphometric parameters were based on the report of the American Society for Bone
and Mineral Research histomorphometry nomenclature28 and were obtained using the
OsteoMeasure bone histomorphometry software (OsteoMetrics). During preparation and
analysis of tibiae, investigators were blinded to specific treatment groups.

positive osteoclasts and the amount of resorption were determined as previously described30.
For NFATc1 nuclear localization, human peripheral blood monocytes were grown in
standard osteoclastic conditions and the ability of LOX to induce nuclear localization of the
transcription factor NFATc1 was measured at day 14 (mature, functional osteoclasts). For
the role of LOX upon NFATc1 nuclear localization, cultures were treated for 24 h with
rLOX; rLOX in the presence of the LOX antibody at 4 mg ml-1; or LOX antibody alone at 4
mg ml-1. To determine whether LOX-induced NFATc1 nuclear localization was mediated by
reactive oxygen species, additional cultures were treated with 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 U
ml-1 catalase with and without rLOX (150 ng ml-1). Primary murine calvarial osteoblasts
were isolated from neonatal BALB/c mice as previously described27, and seeded into 96well plates. To determine the effect of LOX on the differentiation and function of primary
osteoblasts, cells were grown to confluence in normal medium (DMEM GlutaMAX with
sodium pyruvate without phenol red, 100 U ml-1 penicillin and 100 mg ml-1 streptomycin,
10% FBS), and then switched to osteogenic medium (DMEM GlutaMAX with sodium
pyruvate without phenol red (Life Technologies), 100 U ml-1 penicillin and 100 mg ml-1
streptomycin, 0.5% FBS and 50 mg ml-1 L-ascorbic acid (Sigma)) and treated with 10 nM
dexamethasone (positive control), 150 ng ml-1 rLOX, or rLOX + LOX antibody. Cells were
cultured in osteogenic medium for 3 weeks with the medium and treatments replaced every
2–3 days, and 5 mM inorganic phosphate added to all treatments 3 days before the end of the
culture. Human osteoblast-like cells (SaOS-2), maintained as previously described30, were
treated with CM from 4T1 cells as previously described13 and the effect after 3 days on cell
number was measured. SaOS-2 cells were also grown in osteogenic medium and the effect
of the CM on the differentiation of these cells and their ability to mineralize was assessed
after 7 days by quantification of alizarin red staining.

Cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 100% ethanol overnight at 4°C. Nodules formed by

Bioluminescent intravital imaging of bone colonisation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Adult female BALB/c mice (8 weeks old) were conditioned as described above. After 3
weeks of conditioning, mice were anaesthetized and 1 x 105 4T1Luc cells were injected
intracardially into the left cardiac ventricle. Once a week, mice were injected with 120 mg
kg-1 luciferin and metastatic dissemination of the cells was monitored using IVIS Lumina II
(Caliper LifeSciences). Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation 3–5 weeks after tumour cell
injection. Metastatic burden was quantified using Living Image software (Caliper Life
Sciences) by measuring the luminescent signal from each leg; regions of interest are shown
in Fig. 4. During analysis of IVIS data, investigators were blinded to specific treatment
groups.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting for lysyl oxidase was as previously described3,13. Conditioned media and
cellular lysates were prepared as previously described3,13. Primary LOX antibody (Open
Biosystems) was used at 1:100 and β-actin (Abcam) at 1:10,000, with incubation overnight
at 4°C. Species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies were used at 1:25,000 and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and visualization performed using ECL Plus
(Amersham, GE Healthcare).
Immunohistochemistry for tumour hypoxia

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with pimonidazole (60 mg kg-1) 1 h before culling.
After excision, tumours were fixed in 4% PFA overnight before processing and embedding
in paraffin according to standard histopathology techniques. Sections (4 μm) were cut and
deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained with Hypoxyprobe (Hypoxyprobe) overnight after
citrate-buffer-mediated antigen retrieval according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Hypoxyprobe binding was visualized with 3,3-diaminobenzidine before counterstaining with
haematoxylin. Images were taken on a NanoZoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu).
Explant cultures
The 4T1Luc line was implanted orthotopically as described above. Explant cultures of 4T1
tumour-bearing mice were generated at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks after implant in the following
ways. From primary tumour, small 5 mm3 biopsies were taken and mechanically
disaggregated to produce a single cell suspension. From lung, the left lobe was removed,
washed and mechanically disaggregated to produce a single cell suspension. From bone,
hindlimbs were separated at the joint and all extraneous tissue removed. Tibiae were opened
at both end and bone marrow as well as tumour cells were flushed by syringe three times
using PBS. From skin, a small 5 mm2 punch of distant skin was mechanically disaggregated
to produce a single cell suspension. Collected cells were washed and plated in standard
serum containing media. Forty-eight hours after seeding, media were changed to remove
non-adhered cells and 500 mg ml-1 Zeocin (the selective marker for the luciferase cassette)

mg ml-1 was added just before bio-luminescent imaging using the IVIS Lumina II, and
quantification of luminescent signal used Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences).
Q-RTPCR

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRizol (Invitrogen) and purified RNA treated with
DNase I (New England Biolabs), both according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Complementary DNA synthesis were performed using an M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Kit
(Invitrogen). qRT–PCR for β-actin and firefly luciferase was performed using a LightCycler
480 (Roche). Firefly luciferase was amplified using the primers 5’CTCACTGAGACTACATCAGC-3’ and 5’-TCCAGATCCACAACCTTCGC-3’, and for βactin 5’-GAGGCCCAGA GCAAGAGAGG-3’ and 5’-TACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAA-3’.
ELISA
ELISA plates were coated with sera from 4T1scr and 4T1shLOX tumour- bearing mice at
4°C overnight. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA at 37°C for 3 h. Our anti-LOX antibody
was prepared in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, and 100 μl was added to wells for 2 h at room
temperature. Binding of anti-LOX antibody to LOX protein was detected using horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-labelled secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). The CTX-I ELISA
(RatLaps) was used for quantitative determination of bone-related degradation products
from CTX of type I collagen in mouse serum released by osteoclasts. All procedures were
performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines using sera from animals taken
at time of cull. A sandwich ELISA for detecting human RANKL in the osteoclast medium
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (DuoSet, R&D Systems Europe). The
sensitivity of the RANKL ELISA was 78.1–5,000 pg ml-1.

considered shows that in all patients, LOX expression is associated with bone relapse
compared to no relapse (P=0.0389). This also pertains to ER-negative patients (P=0.0126)
but not ER-positive patients (P=0.9537). c, Cox-regression using log2-LOX expression data
was used to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR) in two analyses. One analysis was performed
using the no-relapse patients and the bone relapse patients (data belonging to Fig.1f) and the

Figure 3. Tumour-secreted LOX modulates osteoclasts and osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo.

a, rLOX (in the absence of RANKL) stimulates osteoclastogenesis. b, c, rLOX generated
osteoclasts exhibit high resorptive ability; arrow = osteoclast, arrowheads = resorption
tracks. (a-c)(n: osteoclast count from 12 independent osteoclast assays per group). d, rLOX
induces nuclear localization of the master transcription factor NFATc1 in the absence of
RANKL (n: osteoclast NFATc1 nuclear intensity; control 12; +RANKL 196, +rLOX 191
across 3 independent experimental repeats [donors] from 16 fields of view per donor). e,
LOX antibody treatment blocks NFATc1 localization. f, Catalase treatment blocks rLOXinduced nuclear localization of NFATc1 (e,f represents data from 32 measurements of
NFATc1 nuclear intensity from each of 3 independent donors [96 total]) g, rLOX added to
primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts increases mineralization ability (DEX =
dexamethasone) (n: alizarin red S intensity; 16 wells per group across 2 independent
experimental repeats) h, 4T1scr mammary tumours decrease osteoblast number compared to
shLOX (n: mice; Control 10; 4T1scr Tumour 7; 4T1 shLOX Tumour 9) and i, increase
osteoclast number on the endocortical surface of bone (per mm bone perimeter)(n: mice;
Control 10; 4T1scr Tumour 8; 4T1 shLOX Tumour 9). j, Representative images of
osteoblasts (arrows) and osteoclasts (*) in sections of bone. k, 4T1scr tumour bearing mice
treated with the anti-LOX antibody show similar effects on osteoblast l, osteoclast number
(n: mice; 4T1scr Tumour + IgG 5; 4T1scr Tumour + LOX Ab 7). m, Representative sections

Figure 4. LOX-mediated lesions are osteoclast-driven and enhance circulating tumour cell
colonisation.

a, Representative 3D reconstructions of tibiae from tumour bearing mice with or without BP
treatment b, Tibial bone loss is abrogated in tumour bearing mice treated with
bisphosphonate (n: mice; Control 5; 4T1scr Tumour 4; 4T1scr Tumour + BP 4) c, Similar
effects are observed in CM conditioned models treated with bisphosphonates (n=5 mice all
groups) d, Quantification of e, Whole body IVIS imaging of intracardially injected 4T1Luc
tumour cells following conditioning with 4T1scr or 4T1shLOX CM. White boxes – tumour
burden analysis region of interest (n: mice; 4T1scr CM+IgG 8; 4T1scr CM+LOXAb 8;
4T1shLOX CM+IgG 10) f, Micro-CT lesion analysis of mice after intracardiac injection
following pre-conditioning (n: mice; 4T1scr CM+IgG 6; 4T1scr CM+LOXAb 8; 4T1shLOX
CM+IgG 8) g, Representative whole body IVIS imaging of 4T1Luc tumour cells at 1 week
and 5 weeks after intracardiac injection. Mice were conditioned with hypoxic 4T1scr CM
with and without simultaneous treatment with bisphosphonate. White boxes – tumour
burden analysis region of interest. h, Log2 quantitation of (g) (n=5 mice all groups) i,
Schematic of LOX mediated effects on bone homeostasis in vivo. (b-d,f,h) Data shown is
mean ± SEM. P-values derived from unpaired parametric two-tailed t-tests. (*P<0.05,
