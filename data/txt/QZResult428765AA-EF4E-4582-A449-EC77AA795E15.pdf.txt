ABSTRACT
In glioblastoma several histone demethylase genes (KDM) are overexpressed
compared to normal brain tissue and the development of Temozolomide (TMZ)
resistance is accompanied by the transient further increased expression of KDM5A
and other KDMs following a mechanism that we defined as “epigenetic resilience”. We
hypothesized that targeting KDMs may kill the cells that survive the cytotoxic therapy.
We determined the effect of JIB 04 and CPI-455, two KDM inhibitors, on
glioblastoma cells and found that both molecules are more effective against TMZresistant rather than native cells.
Because of its lower IC50, we focused on JIB 04 that targets KDM5A and
other KDMs as well. We have shown that this molecule activates autophagic and
apoptotic pathways, interferes with cell cycle progression, inhibits cell clonogenicity
and dephosphorylates Akt thus inactivating a potent pro-survival pathway. We
performed combination temozolomide/JIB 04 in vitro treatments showing that
these two molecules, under certain conditions, have a strong synergic effect and we
hypothesize that JIB 04 intercepts the cells that escape the G2 block exerted by TMZ.
Finally we studied the permeability of JIB 04 across the blood-brain barrier and found
that this molecule reaches bioactive concentration in the brain; furthermore a pilot
in vivo experiment in an orthotopic GB xenograft model showed a trend toward longer
survival in treated mice with an Hazard Ratio of 0.5.
In conclusion we propose that the combination between cytotoxic drugs and
molecules acting on the epigenetic landscape may offer the opportunity to develop
new therapies for this invariably lethal disease.

INTRODUCTION

in the tumor [3–5]. Nevertheless GB rapidly recurs
becoming refractory to other treatments. The constitutive
and acquired drug resistance in GB likely reflects the
cellular and molecular heterogeneity of this tumor and
the presence of Glioma-Initiating Cells, a cell population
with distinct phenotypic and molecular characteristics,
diverse differentiation potential and unique properties of
invasiveness and self-renewal that is considered responsible
for therapeutic failure and tumor recurrence [1, 6].

For many years chemotherapy has had only a
marginal role in glioblastoma (GB) treatment because of
the intrinsic resistance of this tumor to chemotherapy and of
the limited permeability of the blood-brain barrier to drugs
[1–4]. Adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) treatment resulted in
a limited but significant benefit for the patients particularly
if the MGMT gene is inactivated by DNA methylation

The epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair gene
MGMT has a pivotal role in the constitutive resistance
to TMZ, whereas its role in acquired resistance is
controversial [1, 3, 5, 7–11].
Utilizing an in vitro model of inducible drug
resistance [12] we have shown that GB primary cultures
enriched in cancer stem cells respond to the acute
TMZ treatment by developing transient and reversible
resistance through a mechanism that we have defined as
“epigenetic-resilience” to describe the plasticity of tumor
cells in response to “offending” stimuli [12]. We have
hypothesized that the early, reversible, response is largely
epigenetic and that is followed by further alterations
that render GB cells irreversibly resistant to TMZ. In
glioblastoma, several histone demethylase genes (KDMs)
are overexpressed in comparison to normal brain cells and
their expression is transiently further increased during the
acquisition of TMZ resistance [12]. KDMs function as
“partners” of oncogenes and are believed to have a central
role in maintaining normal cell functions as well as in
cancer cells biology and are considered potential targets in
adult and pediatric glioblastoma [13–19] In particular, the
overexpression of KDM5A was found in “Drug Tolerant
Persister” cells (DTP), a subpopulation of tumor cells that
give rise to expanded populations of drug resistant cells
[20] including TMZ- resistant GB cells [12].
In agreement with the hypothesis that KDM5A is
a driver of drug resistance in GB, we showed that the
plasmid-mediated overexpression or RNAi-mediated
silencing of KDM5A mimics TMZ resistance or sensitivity
respectively [12]. KDM5A-mediated drug resistance
likely is a mechanism common to different tumors since it
has been described also in lung, prostate and breast cancer
established cell lines [20–22]. On the other hand KDM1
[14], and more recently KDM6A/B [13] were found to
have a role in glioblastoma and KDM1, KDM4A, KDM5A
and KDM5B are transiently overexpressed in GB cells that
have acquired TMZ resistance [12].
For long time, selective KDM inhibitors (KDMi)
have been available only for KDM1 [23]. Recently two
KDMi, CPI-455 and YUCA1, were identified and found
to inhibit the entire KDM5 family (CPI-455) or KDM5A
and at a lesser extent KDM5C and to prevent the growth
of drug-tolerant cells [24, 25].
Given the potential involvement of many KDM
genes in GB, their targeting could be performed utilizing a
cocktail of selective KDMi; however molecules possessing
multiple specificities might be equally valuable.
JIB 04 is small molecule inhibiting the activity of
the Jumonji family of KDMs [26] and, when tested on
purified proteins, exerts its maximal inhibitory activity
against KDM5A (IC50: 230 nM) and has, as secondary
targets, KDM4D/4B/4A/6B/4C (IC50: 340–1100 nM).
Beside KDM1, KDM4A and KDM5A/5B are up-regulated
in TMZ-resistant GB cells [12], KDM4B is up-regulated
in response to irradiation [27, 28] and KDM6B was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

identified as a possible therapeutic target in the childhood
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) [17]. JB 04
diminishes the growth rate of breast and lung cancer
continuous cell lines in vitro and prolongs survival of mice
with subcutaneous tumor xenografts [26]. As such, JIB 04
appears as a potential candidate for experimental therapies
in GB.
Along this line, taking advantage of the multiple
specificities of JIB 04, we have studied the activity of this
molecule and of the KDM5-specific inhibitor CPI-455
against native and TMZ-resistant GB cells alone and in
combination with TMZ as a preclinical step toward the
development of combination therapies targeting the GB
cells that escape the first line of therapy.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
JIB 04 and CPI-455 preferentially inhibit
proliferation of TMZ-resistant GB cells
GB cells are intrinsically resistant to radio and
chemotherapy. Nevertheless, resistance to TMZ is widely
variable, and depends largely but not exclusively from the
methylation of the MGMT gene [3, 5]. By MTS, we have
evaluated TMZ sensitivity in a panel of GB cell lines and
patients’-derived stem-enriched GB cells and found IC50
values comprised between 174 and 1500 μM for both cell
types (Figure 1, Panels 1A and 1B, unpublished results,
Supplementary Table 1A).
Having previously shown that GB cells overexpress
several KDM genes and that the inhibition of KDM5A by
shRNA sensitized TMZ-resistant GB cells to TMZ [12],
we wanted to determine if the inhibition of the KDM5A
enzyme activity had a similar effect. Accordingly we
tested the activity on GB cells of two recently identified
molecules possessing inhibitory activity on KDM: JIB
04 is a multi KDM inhibitor having its maximal activity
against KDM5A [26] and CPI-455 is a molecule that
selectively inhibits the KDM5 family [24].
As shown in Figure 1, Panels 1C and 1D, in
Supplementary Figure 1, Panel 1A and in Supplementary
Table 1B and 1C, the multispecific KDM inhibitor JIB 04
significantly inhibits the proliferation of GB cell lines and
stem-enriched cultures. In general, the cells presenting
higher TMZ resistance were also those less sensible to
the effect of JIB 04 and this finding raised the possibility
that TMZ resistance and JIB 04 sensibility could be
interlinked.
We then generated three U251 cell lines resistant
to 200, 300 and 400 µM TMZ (Figure 1 Panel E1 and
Supplementary Figure 1, Panel 1C) and we treated them
with JIB 04 for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. As Shown in
Figure 1, Panels E2–E5 and in Supplementary Figure 1,
Panels 1B and 1C, after 24 hours of treatment the IC50
values of TMZ resistant cells were significantly lower
than those of native cells. After 48 hours the IC50 values

JIB 04 treatment modulates the expression
of genes involved in the control of cancer cell
growth and leads to hypermethylation of H3K4

of the resistant cells was approximately half of that
of native cells although this difference did not reach
statistical significance. At 72 and 96 hours TMZ resistant
and native cells were equally sensitive to JIB 04. A
similar effect, although less evident, was seen also in two
distinct TMZ-resistant patients’ derived, stem enriched
GBM3 cells generated from the same parental culture at
the distance of one year each from the other (Figure 2,
Panels A1 and A2).
Overall these results demonstrate that the inhibition
of KDM activity reduces the proliferation of glioma
cells and that TMZ resistant cells are, up to a certain
extent, more sensitive to JIB 04 than native cells likely
because these cells, overexpressing KDM genes, are more
efficiently targeted by KDM inhibitors.
To test the effect of JIB 04 on non- or slowproliferating cells, we cultured GB cells grown in stempermissive conditions or induced to differentiate by the
addition of serum to the medium. Under differentiated
conditions the cells reduce their proliferative activity and
eventually stop dividing while undergoing morphological
changes (Supplementary Figure 2, Panel 2A). Stem and
differentiating primary GB cultures present striking
differences in JIB 04 sensitivity and, as shown in
Supplementary Figure 2, Panel 2B, the differentiating
cells that proliferate slowly or do not proliferate at all are
resistant to JIB 04 over a wide range of concentrations
compared to their stem-enriched, proliferating, counterpart.
JIB 04 exerts its maximal inhibitory activity against
KDM5A. However, since this molecule is active also
against other KDMs overexpressed in glioma cells, it
was impossible to unequivocally attribute its effect on
cell survival to the inhibition of a specific KDM and
particularly to KDM5A that we have hypothesized to
be a mediator of drug resistance in GB cells [12]. To
directly address the role of the KDM5 family in the
survival of TMZ-resistant GB cells we have utilized the
selective KDM5 inhibitor CPI 455 [24]. As shown in
Figure 2, Panel 2B, CPI 455 had a modest but significant
effect on cell viability of native GB cells only at high
concentration. Conversely, the activity of CPI 455 against
independently derived TMZ resistant cell was significantly
stronger than that exerted on the parental cells (Figure 2,
Panel 2C). Overall this result demonstrates that the
inhibition of the KDM5 enzyme activity reduces the
proliferation of TMZ resistant GB cells and fully agrees
with our previous results showing that silencing KDM5A
sensitizes the cells to TMZ. Moreover, the overexpression
of KDM genes in TMZ resistant GB cells, increasing
KDM enzymatic activity, render these cells preferential
targets for these molecules.
Although both JIB 04 and CPI 455 are active against
TMZ resistant GBM cells we focused our further study on
JIB 04 because its IC50 is much lower than that of CPI
455 making easier, in principle, to reach clinically relevant
concentration for in vivo studies.

Previous mRNA profiling studies conducted on
the non-small cell lung cancer cell line H358 showed
that JIB 04, within 4 hours of treatment, upregulated
approximately 100 genes including many negative
regulators of proliferation and genes responsive to DNA
damage or to oxidative stress and downmodulated a set of
20 genes that includes several pro-growth genes [26]. We
have examined, in GB cell lines A172 and U251, the effect
of JIB 04 on the transcription of two proliferation genes
(CCNB1 and PCNA), and of two other genes that, at large,
could be functionally considered as tumor suppressors
(DEPP and DDIT4). The stress-responsive DEPP gene
(c10orf10) leads to the activation of the autophagy
pathway [29] whereas DDIT4 is a gene responsive to
hypoxia and DNA damage and activates p53-mediated
apoptosis [30].
As shown in Figure 2, Panel C, short (4H) treatment
of A172 and U251 downmodulated CCNB1 and PCNA
and strongly upmodulated DEPP and DDIT4. To explore
the mechanism of JIB 04 induced overexpression of
DEPP, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
with an antibody against trimethylated H3K4 followed
by real time amplification and, consistently with the
inhibitory activity of JIB 04 on KDM5A, we found that
the chromatin region upstream the transcription start site
of DEPP was highly enriched in H3 trimethylated at K4
(Figure 2, Panel 2D).

JIB 04 activates the autophagy and apoptotic
pathways and inactivates PI3K
Having determined that JIB 04 is a potent inhibitor
of the proliferation of GB cells either native or resistant
to TMZ, we explored some of the mechanisms that
potentially could take part in the antitumor activity of this
molecule.
To determine if the overexpression of DEPP in
response to JIB 04 could activate the autophagy pathway
we measured by flow cytometry the extent of LC3
translocation into autophagosomes [31] in A172 and
U251 cells treated with JIB 04 for 4 hours. As show in
Figure 3, Panel 3A, the exposure to JIB 04 for 4 hours,
induced autophagy by 4.0 and 5.1 folds (red profile) over
untreated cells (grey profile) in A172 and U251 cells
respectively.
Longer (48–96 hours) exposure of the cells
to JIB 04 resulted in the time-dependent significant
strong induction of apoptosis under a wide range of
molecule concentrations in both primary and established
cultures as well as in TMZ resistant GB cells (Figure 3,
Panel 3B, Supplementary Figure 3, Panels 3A–3C, and
Supplementary Table 2).

The activation of the PI3K pathway
(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/rapamycinsensitive mTOR-complex (mTOR) pathway) is one of the
most potent pro-survival pathways whose inappropriate
activation is a frequent finding in human tumors. Targeting
the PI3K pathway is considered one of the most promising
avenues for cancer treatment [32]. In glioblastoma the
levels of Phospho-PI3K, Phospho-Akt and Phospho-p70s6k,
indicative of the PI3K activation, were associated with
reduced apoptosis and shorter survival time of the patients
[33]. Importantly, the activation of this pathway was put
in relation with resistance to TMZ and radiotherapy in
GB [33, 34]. Consequently, targeting the PI3K pathway
in GB patients is being actively exploited as a potential
innovative therapy for glioblastoma [35].
We have studied by cytometry the effect of JIB 04
on the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, an activating
modification of Akt. We have analyzed a panel of
primary and established GB cells for Akt activation and
found that the baseline level of Akt phosphorylation is
widely variable (from more than 80% to less than 5%
of positive cells, data not shown). In U251 the majority
of the cells carries phosphorylated Akt (Figure 3,
Panel 3C, left) but the treatment with 1 μM JIB 04 for
1 hour was sufficient to significantly decrease the extent
of Akt phosphorylation and to increase the fraction of
cells bearing inactivated Akt. After 24 hours the effect of
JIB 04 on Akt phosphorylation was even more evident
and in the majority of the cells Akt was inactivated. In
A172 Akt is constitutively inactive in more than 70% of
the cells (Figure 3, Panel 3C, right ). Nevertheless, the
treatment with JIB 04 resulted in the significant decrease
of the number of cells bearing the activated form of Akt
(from 23.1 to 6.5 %) with the consequent increase of those
with the inactive form. After 24 hours of treatment in
91.1 % of the cells Akt was inactivated. In U251TMZ R
cells, phosphorylation of AKT was higher than that of the
native counterpart (77.5 vs 63.9) and the decrease of Akt
phosphorylation upon JIB 04 treatment was significant
but much less evident than that of the native cells after 1
hour of treatment. However, after 24 hours the decrease of
phosphorylation became much more evident and highly
significant (Supplementary Figure 2, Panel 3D). Overall
these results confirm the role of the PI3K pathway in
drug resistance and demonstrate that the KDM inhibitor
JIB 04 can interfere with multiple pathways involved
in the control of tumor cell growth in native and TMZ
resistant cells.

Materials and Methods) after treatment of the primary
GBM3 cell culture with JIB 04. As shown in Figure 4,
Panel 4A and in Supplementary Table 3, the significant
reduction of cell viability was time and dose-dependent
and was detectable, at high JIB 04 concentrations,
1 hour after the beginning of the treatment. The extent of
reduction slightly increased after 4 and 24 hours reaching
its maximum level after 72 hours. We initially tested
the effect of JIB 04 on clonogenicity after treatments of
24 and 48 hours and found that, under these conditions,
no colonies could be detected in native and TMZ-resistant
GB cells at the concentrations tested (600 and 1200 nM,
data not shown). The effect of JIB 04 on clonogenicity is
evident even at low concentration and short exposure time.
Indeed, the dramatic reduction of the clonogenic property
of the cells can be observed, in primary and established
cell lines, even after 1 hour of treatment (Figure 4,
Panels 4B, 4C and 4D). Importantly, the potent inhibitory
effect of JIB 04 on colony formation is not restricted to
native cells and extends to the TMZ resistant derivatives
with similar kinetics (Figure 4, Panels 4C and 4D).

JIB 04 cooperates with TMZ in killing GB cells
TMZ, along with surgery and radiotherapy, is part of
the standard care for glioblastoma patients. Unfortunately
the clinical efficacy of TMZ is diminished by the therapydriven chemoresistance and recurring tumors are often
hypermutated and resistant to further therapies [36].
We have shown that the early stages of TMZ resistance
are epigenetically-driven and partially reversible and
we reasoned that hitting the cells that escape from
TMZ treatment before acquiring mutations leading to
irreversible drug resistance could offer new opportunities
for GB treatment. In this respect JIB 04 is a molecule
that, in principle, could potentiate the effect of TMZ since
inactivates several KDMs including the product of the
KDM5A gene whose overexpression or silencing mimics
TMZ resistance or sensitivity, respectively [12].
We initially performed combination experiments
cultivating A172 and GBM 3 cells simultaneously with
TMZ and JIB 04 and monitoring the effects of the two
molecules by MTS and induction of apoptosis. The
dose-effect relationships of the drug combination were
evaluated utilizing the mass-action law and the medianeffect equations to calculate the Combination Index (CI)
as measure of the interaction between TMZ and JIB 04
as described by Chou and Talalay [37]. According to
this equation, a CI < 1 is indicative of synergy between
two drugs whereas CI = 1 and CI > 1 indicate additive
or antagonistic effects, respectively. As shown in
Figure 5, Panel 5A, the combination of TMZ and JIB 04,
showed a weak synergism between the two molecules
(CI: 0.30–0.71). The synergy between the two molecules
became very strong when the cells were exposed to
TMZ only for 48 hours followed by further 12 hours of

A brief treatment of GB cells with JIB 04 is
sufficient to strongly reduce clonogenicity
The dephosphorylation of Akt after a 1-hour
exposure of the cells to JIB 04 prompted us to investigate
the biological consequences of this brief treatment. We
initially measured cell viability by Real-Time MT (see

JIB 04 treatment (CI: 0.02–0.1) (Figure 5, Panel 5B). A
conflicting result was initially obtained when we tested the
TMZ-JIB 04 combination on the primary stem-enriched
GBM 3 culture. As shown in Figure 5, Panel 5C, the two
molecules showed a moderate to strong antagonist effect
if utilized together (CI: 2.1 -> 10). However, when the
cells were exposed first to TMZ for 48 hours and then
to JIB 04 for 12 hours, the combination showed, as in

A172, a synergic effect that turned into additive only at
the lowest drug concentration (CI: 0.44–1.06) (Figure 5,
Panel 5D). This result likely reflects the cellular
heterogeneity of primary GB cultures that mimic the
molecular and cellular complexity of the tumor.
Although we do not yet have a mechanistic support
to explain the synergy between JIB 04 and TMZ when
administered sequentially, we hypothesize that, under our

experimental conditions, this effect could be the result of
the different interference of TMZ and JIB 04 on cell cycle.
It is known that TMZ-treated GB cells accumulate at the
G2 checkpoint. and we have shown that the cells that
acquire TMZ resistance overcome the G2 checkpoint and
continue to proliferate entering in G1 [12]. The cell cycle

analysis of GB cells treated with JIB 04 for 48 hours,
show the progressive dose-dependent accumulation in
G0/G1 (Supplementary Figure 4). We hypothesize that
JIB 04 intercepts the cells that escape G2 before they
progress through the cell cycle and eventually acquire new
mutations that renders them permanently drug resistant.

the CI indicates an additive effect at the lowest concentration and moderate synergy between the two molecules at higher concentrations.
(Panel E) Working hypothesis on the mechanism of the combined effect of JIB 04 and TMZ. TMZ blocks the cell cycle at the G2
checkpoint. The cells that acquire TMZ resistance can pass G2 and resume proliferation. JIB 04 target these cycling cells cooperating with
TMZ (see also Supplementary Figure 4 for the effect of JIB 04 on cell cycle).

In vivo analysis of the effect of JIB 04 in an
orthotopic mouse model of GB

molecule can interfere with the growth of glioblastoma
cells in vivo in an orthotopic setting.

In spite of many clinical and experimental trials
with novel drugs, no substantial improvement in survival
was obtained over the standard protocol. Many anticancer
agents strongly active in vitro against GBM cells cannot
penetrate and diffuse the brain because the Blood Brain
Barrier (BBB) impedes the delivery of clinically relevant
concentrations of these drugs and the tight grid formed
by glial cells strongly limits the diffusion of therapeutic
molecules at the tumor site.
For the initial assessment of acute toxicity in vivo we
utilized JIB 04 from different manufacturers. Although the
effect on cell proliferation in vitro was essentially equivalent
between JIB 04 from different Companies (Supplementary
Figure 4, Panel 4B), we observed that adverse effects
in vivo occurred between 80 and 110 mg/kg depending from
the batch and from the manufacturer (data not shown).
To determine if JIB 04 could pass through the
BBB we developed a mass spectrometry protocol to
unequivocally identify this molecule in tissue extracts
(Supplementary Figure 5). We then performed a
preliminary biodistribution analysis in 6 mice treated
with 50 mg/kg of JIB 04 in a single i.p. administration.
Under these conditions we observed a plasmatic peak
at 30′ followed by the accumulation of the molecule in
the liver and kidney. Mass spectrometry of whole brain
extract showed detectable amount of JIB 04 indicative of
the passage of the molecule through the BBB (data not
shown). To determine if clinically relevant amount of
JIB 04 could reach the brain, we treated daily for 5 days
9 mice with 60, 40 and 20 mg/kg of JIB 04, a schedule
well tolerated by the mice. At the end of the treatment
the mice were sacrificed and the concentration of JIB
04 was measured in the brain and in plasma. As shown
in Figure 6, Panel 6A, JIB 04 was readily detectable in
the brain of healthy mice with an intact BBB and at the
dosage of 60 mg/kg the concentration in the brain reached
approximately 200 nM.
In an earlier study it was demonstrated that JIB
04 inhibits cancer growth in mice xenografted with
a non-small lung carcinoma cell line [26]. To assess
the antitumor effect of JIB 04 in a stringent orthotopic
context, we performed a pilot in vivo treatment in 5 mice
xenografted in the brain with the GB cell line DBTRG
and compared utilizing the product-limit method (KaplanMeier), the outcome of the treated mice with that of other
5 xenografted mice that received the vehicle alone. As
shown in Figure 6, Panel 6B, the survival curves of treated
and control mice were clearly distinct, but the difference
did not reach statistical significance possibly because of
the very limited number of mice included in this pilot
study. Nevertheless, the Hazard Ratio of the JIB 04 treated
mice/placebo was about 0.5, suggesting that indeed this

Cell lines, GB CSC cultures and drugs
The human GB cell lines A172, U251, CAS1,
DBTRG and U87 were obtained from the Biological
Bank and Cell Factory of IRCCS AOU San Martino - IST
(www.iclc.it) and were grown in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine. The authenticity
of the cells was certified by the Biological Bank utilizing
eight highly polymorphic STR loci plus amelogenin (Cell
IDTM, Promega).
GB cultures derived from primary GB, were
cultivated in stem-permissive, serum-free medium as
previously described [49, 50]. Cell differentiation was
carried out by shifting GBM CSCs in serum-containing
medium (10% FBS). TMZ resistance was induced as
previously described [12].
Temozolomide (TMZ) was acquired from SigmaAldrich (Milano, Italy), JIB 04 from Tocris (Bristol, UK)
or Selleckchem (Munich, Germany) and CPI 455 was
from Axon Medchem (Groningen, NL). TMZ and CPI 455
were dissolved in DMSO at 100 and JIB 04 was dissolved
in DMSO at 10 mM. All chemicals were stored at −80°C
and diluted in culture medium immediately before use.

Cellular analyses
Cell proliferation and viability were measured
by colorimetric MTS (One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay, Promega, Milano, Italy) or, when indicated, by
continuous-read luminescent MT assay (RealTime-Glo
MT Cell Viability Assay, Milano, Italy).
Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis (measured by annexin
V staining), induction of autophagy measured by LC3
staining into autophagosomes and PI3K activation were
determined utilizing a Muse Cell Analyzer and the
dedicated kits (Millipore-Merck, Vimodrone MI, Italy).
Cell assays were performed in duplicate or
triplicate and each experiment was repeated at least twice.
Clonogenicity assays were performed as previously
described [12].

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionPCR and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
(CHIP)
Real Time PCR analysis was carried out as
described [12]. Primers for CCNB1, PCNA and DEPP
were those utilized by Wang et al. [26], Primers for DDIT4
were designed by Primer 3 (http://primer3.ut.ee/) and their

CCTGGACAGCAGCAACAGT. Relative quantification
of each target gene transcript was obtained using
comparative Ct method. Reference genes (ATP5b, SDHA1,
and CYC1) were selected using GeNorm (PrimerDesign
Ltd, Southampton, UK). For each cDNA, the duplicate Ct
values were averaged and normalized (geometric mean).
The copy number was expressed relative to a calibrator
sample using the 2−(ΔΔCt ± SD) method.
CHIP was performed utilizing the Epitect®
ChIP One Day Kit (Qiagen, Milano, Italy) utilizing the
technical conditions reccomended by the manufacturer.
Immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti
H3K4me3 Polyclonal Antibody (Epigentek, Farmingdale
NY, USA). As irrelevant antibody we utilized a chicken

correction for multiple comparisons). The accepted value
of significance was 0.05. All statistical analyses were
performed using Graph Pad Prism software (GraphPad
Software, San Diego CA, USA).
Interaction between TMZ and JIB 04 was evaluated
by testing the activity of TMZ and JIB 04 combined
together at a constant ratio. The Combination Index (C.I.)
that quantitatively express drug interaction, was calculated
according to the Chou-Talalay equations utilizing the
CompuSyn software (www.combosyn.com) [37].

In vivo experiments and animal model
For in vivo experiments mice were housed in
pathogenic-free conditions, and they were handled in
agreement with guidelines conforming to current Italian
regulations for the protection of animals used for scientific
purposes (D.lvo 27/01/1992, no.116).
Procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee
for Animal Experimentation of the National Institute of
Cancer Research and by the Italian Ministry of Health
(#751/2016-PR) and were performed according to the
National Regulation on Animal Research Resources.

Statistical analysis and drugs interaction
Statistical significance was determined by analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni

For the evaluation of JIB-04 toxicity and organ
distribution, groups of 4 C57 BL6/J mice (8 weeks old;
Charles River Laboratories, Lecco, Italy) were injected i.p.
with singles scalar doses of the drug, up to 110 mg/kg in
10% DMSO 90% sesame oil. Blood samples (0,1 ml) were
collected by retro-orbital bleeding at 30 min, 3 and 6 hours
after drug administration. Following mice euthanasia
after the last bleeding time point, brains were harvested
weighted and homogenized in ice-cold water (5 ml/g
tissue). For chronic administration, the same procedure
was repeated after 5 days dosage at 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/die.
Intracranial tumor inoculation was performed on
adult NOD-SCID mice (6–8 weeks old; Charles River
Laboratories, Lecco, Italy) as already described (PMID:
24443327). Briefly, animals were positioned into a
stereotactic apparatus and injected into the left striatum
with 3 μ l of cell suspension, containing 3e5 trypan bluenegative DBTRG cells. One week after tumor inoculation,
mice were randomly assigned to treatment and control
groups (5 mice/group). Treated mice received 80 mg/kg
3 times weekly for 3 weeks. Mice were monitored daily
and sacrificed at the onset of neurological symptoms.

place during the first isocratic step, a strong hydrophobic
washing step is required to assure the complete elution of
highly lipophilic molecules contained in the brain tissues.
The eluent flow was directly sent to the electrospray (ESI)
ion source of the 6210 Time of Flight mass spectrometer
(Agilent Technology) to characterize the HPLC peaks.
The following operation parameters were applied:
capillary voltage: 3000 V; nebulizer pressure: 20 psig;
drying gas: 5 L/min; gas temperature: 300°C; fragmentor
voltage: 200 V; skimmer voltage: 60 V; octapole RF: 250
V. The instrument performed the internal mass calibration
automatically, using a dual nebulizer electrospray source
with an automated calibrant delivery system. The fullscan data, recorded using the Agilent’s Mass Hunter
software, were processed with Mass Hunter Qualitative
Analysis (Agilent Technology). Mass spectra, ranging
from 100-1000 m/z, were acquired in reflectron positive
ion mode and the relative amount of JIB-04 was measured
by extracted ion current (EIC) peak area (m/z 309.09
[M+H]+).

Pharmacokinetic of JIB 04

In an attempt to improve the outcome of GB
patients, many clinical trials were launched in the last
years to test the efficacy of consolidated “biological
drugs”, and of targeted and immunological therapies
active against many other tumor types (reviewed in ref.
[38]). Overall, the results of many phase I/II and III
clinical trials were highly disappointing showing, at best,
a very limited efficacy often with severe adverse effects
[38–40]. The results of the ongoing phase I/II/III trials that
include the blockers of “immune checkpoints” PD1 and/
or CTLA-4 that have a proved efficacy in other tumors
[41] and in preclinical GB models [42] appear promising,
although not impressive [43, 44] .
In the recent years the recognition of the
involvement of epigenetic mechanisms and epigenetic
alterations in cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance
has opened the possibility for the development of new
drugs aimed at these targets. In this respect epigenetics
and epigenomics are becoming important tools not only
for therapeutic intervention [19, 23, 24, 26, 45], but also as
predictor of drug response [46, 47]. In particular, histone
demethylases have gained a particular importance because
of their central role in a variety of aspects of the cells’
functionality and as therapeutic targets [23, 48].
In this report we show that targeting KDMs with
synthetic inhibitors of their activity can interfere with
tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Having identified
KDM5A as a demethylase involved in TMZ resistance in
GB, we targeted this enzyme with JIB 04, a multi-KDM
inhibitor with maximal activity against KDM5A, [12, 20–
22, 24] and with CPI 455 a selective KDM5 inhibitor [24].
We showed that both molecules can efficiently inhibit GB
cell growth in native and TMZ-resistant GB cells. JIB 04
is sensibly more potent than CPI 455 as antineoplastic

CONCLUSIONS

For each sample 205 µl of acetonitrile were added
to 45 µl of tissue homogenate. Samples were vortexed for
30 seconds, incubated at room temperature for 10 min and
then centrifuged for 15 min. Finally, 200 µl of supernatant
were collected, lyophilized and stored at −20°C until
used. The same procedure was also applied for the
analysis of the plasma samples. A JIB 04 calibration curve
was prepared in brain homogenate. The concentration
of the calibration curve ranged from 0.005 µM to
10 µM containing the following JIB 04 concentration:
0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 µM. Each point was
assayed in duplicate. JIB 04 content was determined by
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/mass
spectrometry (MS). The separation was carried out using
an HPLC system consisting of a vacuum degasser, an
autosampler, a capillary pump and a thermostated column
compartment (Agilent series 1200, Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA, USA). Briefly, the lyophilized samples
were reconstituted with 60 µl of acetonitrile and sonicated
for 5 minutes, then 40 µl of water were added to each
tube and the samples were centrifuged for 15 min. Two
microliters of sample were injected onto a 0.5 mm ×
250 mm, 5 µm particle size, ZORBAX SB-C18 column
(Agilent Technologies). Mobile phases A was 20 mM
ammonium formate in acetonitrile–water-formic acid
(60:40:0.1); mobile phase B was isopropanol-acetonitrile
(80:20). The flow rate was 20 µl/min, and the elution was
performed in this sequence: isocratic 100% A for 10 min,
a linear gradient over the course of three min to 100%
B, maintained at 100% B for 25 min and finally a linear
gradient to 100% A in three min. The re-equilibration time
in 100% A was 25 min. Although the JIB 04 elution takes

agent and was utilized for all subsequent experiments.
From a mechanistic point of view, we have shown that
JIB 04 demethylates H3K4 and activates the expression
of cancer-inhibiting genes, interferes with the PI3K/
AKT pathway, one of the central survival mechanisms of
cancer cells and that 60-minutes treatments are sufficient
to activate death mechanisms and to drastically reduce or
abolish the clonogenic properties of GB cells. The higher
potency of JIB 04 over CPI 455 could be explained by its
inhibitory activity over many KDMs possibly involved in
GB cells proliferation and in drug resistance. Indeed we
have previously shown that several KDMs inhibited by
JIB 04 are overexpressed in GB and that their expression
is transiently increased during the acquisition of TMZ
resistance [12]. The determination of the precise role of
these KDMs in GB is presently underway.
We have shown that JIB 04 synergizes with TMZ
and can pass the BBB. In this respect our pilot in vivo
study supports the concept that, in principle, this molecule
can be the prototype of a novel class of drugs. It can be
foreseen that the rapid advances on the knowledge of
KDMs and KDMi(s) [23] will lead to the discovery of
more selective and potent KDM inhibitors [24, 25] that
will likely open the possibility to therapeutically finely
tune histone methylation and that could be amenable for
the utilization in a clinical setting
