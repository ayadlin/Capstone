Past studies have shown that ampliﬁed insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/IGF1 receptor (IGF1-R) signalling has an important role in
colorectal cancer (CRC) development, progression and resistance to treatment. In this report, we demonstrate that downregulation
of microRNA-497 (miR-497) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells. MiR-497
and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 30 untranslated region (30 UTR) binding seed sequence and
are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of CRC tissues relative to paired adjacent normal
mucosa. However, only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 30 UTR activity and downregulation of the
endogenous IGF1-R protein in CRC cells. This was associated with inhibition of cell survival, proliferation and invasion, and increased
sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and 5-ﬂuorouracil, and the death
ligand tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The biological effect of miR-497 on CRC cells was largely mediated
by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling, as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell
survival and proliferation, recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R. Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared
to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1, where these miRs are located at proximity. Similarly to
miR-195, the members of the same miR family, miR-424 that was upregulated, and miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 that were
unaltered in expression in CRC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa, did not appear to have a role in regulating
the expression of IGF1-R. Taken together, these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of
upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells that contributes to malignancy of CRC.

INTRODUCTION
Inappropriate activation of survival signalling pathways causes
uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and increased
motility of cells, and has an important role in cancer development,
progression and resistance to treatment.1,2 In colorectal cancer
(CRC), one of the mechanisms leading to increased activation of
survival signalling pathways, in particular, the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is aberrant expression of type 1
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1-R).3,4 Ampliﬁed
IGF-1/IGF-1R signalling is not only associated with an increased
relative risk for development of CRC, but also contributes to CRC
cell survival, invasion, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.3–8 More recently, it has been shown that IGF1
enriches CRC stem cells, and that targeting IGF1-R results in
reduction of CRC stem cell phenotype in colon cancer.9,10
IGF1-R is a transmembrane protein that contains two extracellular a subunits with the ligand-binding site and two
transmembrane b subunits with intracellular tyrosine kinase
activity.6,8 It is activated by engagement with IGF1 and IGF2 and
has an important physiological role in regulating cell growth and
proliferation that has been established in knockout mice.6,8,11,12

Although upregulation of IGF1-R has been found in many types
of cancers including colon cancer,8 the mechanism(s) of the
increase remains elusive. Recent studies have pointed to a role
of microRNAs (miRs) in post-transcriptional regulation of
IGF1-R.13–16 While a group of miRs including miR-470, miR-669b
and miR-681 are involved in repression of IGF1-R in long-lived
mutant mice,13 miR-375 and miR-7 target IGF1-R in oesophageal
and tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells, respectively.14,16 In
addition, miR-145 targets the docking protein of IGF1-R, insulin
receptor substrate-1, thus inhibiting IGF1-R signalling.17
The expression of miRs is highly tissue and cell type speciﬁc, so
is the functional signiﬁcance of an expressed miR.18–20 How these
speciﬁcities are determined is to be elucidated, but it is known
that miRs are frequently regulated by genomic alterations in
human cancer.7,21 Like in many other cancer types, the expression
and functional importance of miRs in CRC has been studied
extensively in recent years.22–27 Although this has resulted in
identiﬁcation of a large number of miRs that are either
downregulated or upregulated leading to alterations in the
expression of their target genes,22–26 the potential role of miRs
in regulating the expression of IGF1-R and its downstream

signalling in CRC cells has not been investigated. In this report, we
show that miR-497 targets IGF1-R and is frequently
downregulated by gene copy number reduction in CRC. In
addition, we demonstrate that downregulation of miR-497
contributes to elevated activation of PI3K/Akt signalling and
malignant behaviour in CRC cells.

in general decreased levels of the miRs compared with the
CRL-1831 line (Figure 1e). Similarly, miR-424 appeared to be
upregulated in colon cancer cell lines, whereas the levels of miR15a, miR-15b and miR-16 remained unaltered between cultured
colon cancer cells and normal colon epithelia cells (Supplementary
Figure 2).

RESULTS
MiR-497 is downregulated in CRC cells
We compared miRNA expression proﬁles between CRC tissues and
paired adjacent non-cancerous mucosa from 10 individual
patients using a Human miRNA Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) that containing 15 024 probes
corresponding to 939 human miRNA genes. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-195 and miR-497 of the miR-15/16/
195/424/497 family were expressed respectively more than
twofold lower in colon cancer tissues than in normal mucosa. In
contrast, miR-424 was markedly upregulated (42 times) in CRC
samples, whereas there was no signiﬁcant difference (p2 times) in
the expression levels of miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 (Figures 1a
and b; Supplementary Table 1). The decreased miR-195 and miR497 and increased miR-424 expression was conﬁrmed in 137
additional paired samples by qPCR analysis, which showed that
miR-195 and miR-497 were downregulated at least twofold in
colon cancer tissues in 107 and 106 cases, respectively, and miR424, upregulated in 99 cases (Figure 1c; Supplementary Table 2).
Of note, the levels of miR-195 and miR-497 were signiﬁcantly
correlated (Figure 1d), suggesting that their expression may be
regulated in CRC by similar mechanisms.
Despite the alterations in the expression of miR-195, miR-497 and
miR-424 in CRC tissues compared with corresponding normal
mucosa, there was no signiﬁcant difference in their expression
between pooled early stage (stages I–II) and late stage (stages III–IV)
CRC samples, or between those with different anatomic origins (the
ascending, the transverse, the descending, the sigmoid colon or the
rectum), sex or ages (Supplementary Table 2). These results suggest
that downregulation of miR-195 and miR-497 and upregulation of
miR-424 may be a common early event in CRC development.
Nevertheless, analysis of paired colon adenoma tissues and adjacent
normal mucosa (n ¼ 8) showed that there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the expression of these miRs (Supplementary Figure 1).
We also examined the expression of miR-195 and miR-497 in a
panel of six colon cancer cell lines in comparison with the normal
colon epithelial line CRL-1831 by qPCR. Consistent with the results
in colon cancer tissues, cultured colon cancer cell lines expressed

MiR-497 downregulates IGF1-R
One of the predicted common targets of miR-15/16/195/424/497
family members is IGF1-R (http://www.targetscan.org; http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm/htdocs/targets/v5). Since
the latter has an important role in colon cancer cell survival,
proliferation and resistance to treatment,5–7,28 we investigated if
these miRs impinge on the expression of IGF1-R in colon cancer
cells. To this end, we cloned a 1080-bp fragment of the 30 UTR of
IGF1-R that contains the binding region of the miRs into a vector
with the ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene (Figures 2a and b;
Supplementary Figure 3). Introduction of this construct into
HCT116 colon cancer cells showed that the reporter activity was
suppressed, albeit moderately, by the presence of the 30 UTR of
IGF1-R, relative to basal levels observed with the control vector
(Figure 2c). This suppression was reversed when the binding
region was mutated (Figures 2a–c; Supplementary Figure 3),
suggesting that the 30 UTR of IGF1-R was inhibited by the
endogenous expression of one or more members of this miR
family, in particular, miR-424 that is increased in CRC cells.
However, inhibition of miR-424 by co-introduction of anti-miR-424
did not alter the report activity (Figure 2d). Similarly, cointroduction of anti-miR-15a, anti-miR-15b, anti-miR-16 or antimiR-195 did not cause any signiﬁcant change in the activity
(Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast, co-introduction of anti-miR497 triggered an increase in the report activity (Figure 2d),
indicating that miR-497, but not the other miRs, has a role in
inhibiting the 30 UTR of IGF1-R. In support, the addition of miR-497
mimics, but not the addition of miR-195, miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16
or miR424 mimics, further inhibited the reporter activity
(Figure 2e; Supplementary Figure 5). Consistent with the results
of luciferase assays, introduction of miR-497 mimics downregulated, whereas introduction of anti-miR-497 upregulated
endogenous IGF1-R protein levels. On the other hand, introduction of miR-195 mimics or anti-miR-424 had no effect on the
expression of IGF1-R (Figure 2f).
The effect of miR-497 on the expression of IGF1-R in colon
cancer cells was further consolidated by examination of representative colon cancer tissues that expressed increased levels of
miR-424 (42 times) compared with normal mucosa and were

levels of miR-424, colon cancers with low miR-497 expression
displayed relatively high levels of IGF1-R, whereas high miR-497
expression was associated with relatively low levels of IGF1-R
(Figure 2g). Similarly, normal colon cancer mucosa that had in

triggered suppression of IGF1-R is reﬂected in regulation of PI3K/
Akt signalling in colon cancer cells. As expected, introduction of
miR-497 mimics into HCT116 cells caused inhibition of constitutive
Akt activation as determined by the expression of phosphorylated
Akt (pSer473-Akt) (Figure 3a). Consistently, miR-497 mimics
inhibited activation of Akt in response to stimulation with insulin
in HCT116 cells under serum starvation conditions (Figure 3b). Of
note, the levels of Akt activation in cells introduced with miR-497
mimics appeared similar to those in cells introduced with
scramble controls after serum starvation, reiterating that the
inhibitory effect of miR-497 on activation of Akt is mediated by
blockage of upstream signalling resulting from extracellular
stimulation, consistent with its role in inhibition of IGF1-R. In
support, overexpression of IGF1-R abolished the inhibitory effect
of miR-497 mimics on constitutive activation of Akt (Figure 3c),
whereas knockdown of IGF1-R recapitulated the effect miR-497 on
Akt activation in response to insulin stimulation under serum
starvation conditions (Figure 3d). These results indicate that miR497 has an important role in regulation of activation of PI3K/Akt
signalling in colon cancer cells. Similarly to activation of Akt,
activation of ERK was also downregulated, albeit moderately,
when miR-497 was overexpressed, suggesting that miR-497 may
Oncogene (2013) 1910 – 1920

also have a role in regulating activation of the MEK/ERK signalling
pathway (Figure 3e).
MiR-497 inhibits proliferation and invasive behaviour in colon
cancer cells
Having demonstrated that miR-497 regulates activation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway, we examined whether it has a role in
regulation of colon cancer cell survival and proliferation. While
introduction of miR-497 mimics did not cause signiﬁcant
apoptosis in HCT116 cells (around 10% apoptotic cells; Figure 2e
and Supplementary Figure 7), it did result in more signiﬁcant
inhibition of cell viability and proliferation (Figure 4a). Associated
with this was the decreased phosphorylation of GSK3b and
increased expression of p27 and p21, downstream targets of
Akt signalling that are important in regulating cell-cycle progression (Figure 4b). Co-introduction of an IGF1-R-expressing
construct, or an activated form of Akt (myr-Akt), to HCT116 cells,
partially blocked inhibition of cell viability by miR-497 mimics29
(Figures 4a and c), indicating that reduced cell viability in colon
cancer cells when miR-497 is overexpressed is related to
downregulation of IGF1-R and decreased activation of Akt

signalling. In contrast, overexpression of an active form of MEK1
had only a minimal effect on inhibition of cell viability mediated
by miR-497 mimics (Figure 4d), suggesting that the moderate
inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway does not have a major role in
reduced cell viability when miR-497 is overexpressed in colon
cancer cells.
Because the PI3K/Akt pathway also has an important role in
regulating migration and invasion of malignant cells,1,2 we
investigated whether the regulatory effect of miR-497 on IGF1-R/
PI3K/Akt signalling is also reﬂected in its impact on colon cancer
cell invasive behaviour. To this end, we seeded HCT116 cells that
had been introduced with the scramble sequences or miR-497
mimics for 24 h onto Boyden chambers coated with Matrigel.
Cells treated with miR-497 mimics displayed reduced ability to
invade through Matrigel in comparison with those treated
with scrambled sequences, which was efﬁciently reversed by
overexpression of IGF1-R (Figures 2e, 3c, and 4e). These results
suggest that that miR-497-mediated downregulation of IGF1-R
also has a role in inhibition of invasive behaviour of colon
cancer cells.
MiR-497 confers increased sensitivity of colon cancer cells to
apoptosis
Although overexpression of miR-497 did not cause signiﬁcant
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 7), it remains possible that miR497 impinges on sensitivity of colon cancer cells to apoptosis
induced by other stimuli. To test this, HCT116 cells introduced
Oncogene (2013) 1910 – 1920

with scramble controls or miR-497 mimics were exposed to the
DNA-damaging drug, cisplatin, the thymidylate synthase inhibitor,
5-FU, and the death ligand tumour necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Overexpression of miR-497
resulted in increased sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis induced
by all these apoptotic stimuli, as shown by accumulation of
sub-G1 DNA content, enhanced activation of caspase-3 and
cleavage of its substrate PARP (Figures 5a and b). This sensitization
was, at least in part, due to downregulation of IGF1-R and
inhibition of Akt activation, in that co-introduction of an IGF1-Rexpressing construct blocked enhancement in induction of
apoptosis afforded by overexpression of miR-497 mimics
(Figures 3c and 5c), and that co-introduction of an activated form
of Akt (myr-Akt) recapitulated the inhibitory effect of IGF1-R
(Figures 4c and 5d). Similarly, the general caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk or co-introduction of a Bcl-2-expressing construct inhibited
induction of apoptosis even when miR-497 was overexpressed
(Supplementary Figure 8), pointing to the involvement of the
caspase cascade and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Downregulation of miR-497 is associated with DNA copy number
reduction
The ﬁnding that miR-497 and its relative miR-195 are concurrently
downregulated in the majority of colon cancer tissues suggests
that these miRNAs may be regulated by similar mechanisms. One
possibility is that their downregulation is due to genomic
alterations that are frequently involved in regulation of miRNA

expression.7,21 Indeed, the miR-497 and miR-195 genes are located
at proximity to a segment of chromosome 17p13.1 (Figure 6a),
which was found to be deleted in 6 of 10 colon cancer samples
compared with corresponding normal mucosa by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH; Figures 6a and b). Copy
number reduction at this fragment (78K–15M) was conﬁrmed in
the cohort of 131 paired CRC tissue and normal mucosa samples
by genomic qPCR, which showed that B71% of colon cancers had
DNA copy number reduction at this segment (Figure 6c). Of note,
the levels of miR-497 and miR-195 were signiﬁcantly lower in
colon cancer samples with deletion of the segment of chromosome 17p13.1, indicating that downregulation of these miRNAs in
colon cancers is closely related to their DNA copy number
reduction (Figure 6d). As a control, the product of the tumour
suppressor gene TP53 that maps to the same fragment of
chromosome 17p13.1 was also markedly lower in colon cancer
samples with deletion of the locus (Supplementary Figure 9).

DISCUSSION
In this report, we present evidence that miR-497 has an important
role in inhibiting IGF1-R expression and activation of PI3K/Akt
signalling, and in suppressing proliferation, survival and invasive
behaviour in human colon cancer cells. While its expression is
commonly reduced in colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
relative to normal colon epithelial tissues, introduction of
exogenous miR-497 into colon cancer cells resulted in downregulation of IGF1-R and decreased activation of Akt. This was
associated with inhibition of cell proliferation, decreased invasive
potential and enhancement in sensitivity to apoptosis. Our results
also associate the downregulation of miR-497 in colon cancer cells
with the genomic deletion of a fragment of chromosome 17p13.1,
where miR-497 maps.
MiR-497 belongs to the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family. Members of this miR family share the same 30 UTR binding seed
sequence and have been reported to cooperatively regulate a

number of targets, including CDK6, CARD10 and CDC27 leading to
regulation of cell proliferation in concert in colon cancer cells.30
Similarly, miR-15, -16, -195 and -497 have been shown to target
Bcl-2, thus promoting induction of apoptosis, although these
ﬁndings were made in different cell types.27,31–34 However, unlike
miR-497, miR-15, -16, -195 and -424 did not appear to target the
30 UTR of IGF1-R in colon cells. The reason for this discrepancy
remains to be deﬁned, but it is known that seed pairing may not
invariably be a reliable predictor for miR-target interaction.35,36
Other factors, such as AU-rich nucleotide composition and relative
position of binding sites to the stop codon may also have a part in
determining miR targeting speciﬁcity.35,36 It is well documented
that while functional consequences of miR expression are
commonly tissue and cell type speciﬁc, regulation of target
expression by miRs is also in a cell type-dependent manner.7,20 Of
note, results from this study and others indicated that there were
wide variations in the expression of many miRs among normal
colon mucosa samples,37 suggesting that the expression of miRs
in normal tissues is also highly individual dependent.37–39 Whether
this is related to patients’ age, gender, nutritional conditions and
other factors requires further investigation. The miR expression
viability in human cervical tissues has been suggested to be
associated with the presence or absence of the human
papillomavirus in samples.39
The differential expression of a number of miRs in colon cancer
tissues has been proposed to be potential biomarkers for
prognosis and responses to treatment.22–27 For example, the
increased expression of miR-21 was identiﬁed as an independent
predictor of overall survival of colon cancer patients, whereas
let-7g and miR-18b expression was closely associated with
resistance of colon cancer to treatment with S-1, an analogue of
5-FU.40,41 In addition, downregulation of miR-195 has been shown
to correlate with poor prognosis of patients with colon cancer.42
However, because most patients from whom the colon cancer and
control tissues were obtained and analysed in this study are still
alive, we are unable to conclude at present whether the reduced
expression of miR-497 is of signiﬁcance in predicting disease
progression and prognosis of patients. Nevertheless, our results
indicate that the levels of miR-497 are correlated with the levels of
miR-195 in colon cancer tissues, suggesting that downregulation
of miR-497 may, similarly to the reduced expression of miR-195,
associate with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients.42
Moreover, our ﬁnding showing that downregulation of miR-497
and miR-195 and upregulation of miR-424 may be early events in
colon cancer development suggest that the altered expression of
these miRNAs may be a useful biomarker in diagnosis of colon
cancer.
MiR-encoding genes are frequently located to clusters at fragile
sites in the genome where genomic alterations frequently take
place.7,21 In colon cancer, particular chromosomal regions are
commonly gained and overexpressed or lost and underexpressed
in comparison with normal colon mucosa, suggesting that these
changes may be tumorigenic.43 In this study, we found that a
segment of chromosome 17p13.1 where both miR-497 and miR195 are located was frequently deleted in colon cancer cells,
indicating that downregulation of these miRs in the cells is related
to gene copy number reduction. This was further supported by
the result showing that colon cancer samples with deletion of the
fragment had lower levels of miR-497 and miR-195 than those
without the deletion. Consistently, downregulation of miR-497
and miR-195 as a consequence of copy number reduction of
chromosome 17p13.1 has been reported in peritoneal carcinoma
cells.44 Of note, the tumour suppressor gene TP53 also maps to the
same fragment of chromosome 17p13.1, which is frequently
underexprssed in colon cancer cells.45 Together, these results
suggest that deletion of the segment of chromosome 17p13.1 may
have a role in colon cancer tumorigenesis, whereas miR-497 and
miR-195, like p53, may have potential roles as tumour suppressors.
Oncogene (2013) 1910 – 1920

In support of our results, deletions of parts of chromosomal 17p have
been previously reported in colon cancer cells.43
The functional signiﬁcance of miR-497 in regulating malignant
behaviour of colon cancer cells is echoed by its downregulation in
colon cancer tissues in vivo, and is further supported by the
negative association between its expression levels and the levels
of IGF1-R. The increased expression of the latter has an important
role in colon cancer cell proliferation, invasion and resistance
to apoptosis by activation of survival signalling pathways,
in particular, the PI3K/Akt pathway.3–7 Targeting IGF1-R is in
development for clinical use in the treatment of cancer.46,47 Our
results suggest that restoration of the expression of miR-497 may
be a useful alternative strategy for inhibition of IGF1-R in CRC. As a
precedent, replacement therapy has been shown to be efﬁcacious
in a mouse model of colon cancer for miR-145 and miR-33a.48
With continuing investigations into in-vivo delivery systems for
miRs this approach is likely to be achievable.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HCT28, LoVo, Colon205, SW480 and
SW620 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Rockville, MD, USA) and Dr Shafren DR (Faculty of Health, University of
Newcastle, NSW, Australia), and were maintained as monolayers in DMEM
containing 5% FCS (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne, VIC,
Australia). The normal fetal human colon epithelia cell line CRL-1831 was
from ATCC and Dr Chen JZ (Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute,
University of Wollongong, Australia), and were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of
Ham’s F12 and modiﬁed DMEM containing HEPES (25 mM), cholera toxin
(10 ng/ml), insulin (5 mg/ml), transferrin (5 mg/ml) and hydrocortisone
(100 ng/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Recombinant
human insulin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against
Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), ERK, MEK1, phosphorylated GSK3b and GSK3b,
and IGF1-R were from Cell Signalling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
Antibody against p-ERK and Bcl-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies against p27, PARP and
p53 were purchased from BD Biosciences (Bioclone, Marrickville, NSW,
Australia). The antibody against Caspase-3 was from Stressgen (Victoria, BC,
Canada). The cell-permeable general caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)CH2F (z-VAD-fmk) was purchased from Calbiochem (Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany). Mature has-miR-195, -497, -15a, -15b, -16 or -424
mimics (double-stranded oligonucleotides designed to mimic the function
of endogenous miR) and anti-has-miR-195, -497, -15a, -15b, -16 or -424
(antisense RNA oligonucleotides designed to inhibit the function of
endogenous miR) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (North
Ryde, NSW, Australia).

Human tissue samples
Human CRC samples and paired normal mucosa were obtained from
patients undergoing surgical resection of sporadic CRCs in Shanxi Cancer
Hospital. The study was approved by Human Research Ethics Committee of
the hospital. All participants provided written informed consent. In every
case, a histopathological diagnosis of CRC had been ascertained, and a
family history of CRC had been excluded. All tissue samples were selected
by an experienced pathologist immediately after surgical resection, snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at  80 1C. Age, gender and
staging information is given in Supplementary Table 2.

miR microarray
RNA labelling and hybridization on miRNA microarray chips were
performed as previously described49,50 by CapitalBio (Capital-Bio Corp.,
Beijing, China). Brieﬂy, 100 mg total RNA was puriﬁed by using mirVANA
miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) to enrich small RNA fraction.
Puriﬁed RNA was labelled with Cy3 and hybridization was carried out on
miRNA microarray chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) containing 15 024
probes, corresponding to 939 human miRNA genes. To exclude extreme
outliers, miRNAs with expression more or lower than a threshold (mean
fold change 41.2 or o0.8) were eliminated. The remaining data were
normalized, mean-centred and log2 transformed. After SAM analysis
selection, data of 63 miRNAs were assessed using unsupervised

hierarchical clustering. Metric (distance) and Linkage were set as ‘euclidean
distance’ and ‘Average’, respectively.

Quantitative reverse transcription and real-time PCR analysis of
miRs
Total RNA was reverse transcripted from 50 ng total RNA with MMLV
Reverse Transcriptase using following speciﬁc primers: RT-miR-195:
50 -GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACGCCAA
T-30 ; RT-miR-497: 50 -GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATAC
GACACAAAC-30 ; RT-U6: 50 -CGCT TCACG AATTTGCGTGTCAT-30 . Quantitative
reverse transcription and real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) was performed using the
ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA)
with SYBR Green MasterMix. As a control, the small housekeeping U6 was
ampliﬁed and quantitated. Gene-speciﬁc primers used were miR-195 forward,
50 -GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-30 ; miR-195 reverse, 50 -GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-30 ;
miR-497 forward, 50 -GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-30 ; miR-497 reverse, 50 -TAGCCTGC
AGCACACTGT GGT-30 ; U6 forward, 50 -GCTTCGGCAGCACATATACTAAAAT-30 ;
U6 reverse, 50 -CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-30 . Cycle threshold (Ct) values
for speciﬁc genes were normalized to the Ct value of U6. For miR-15a (Assay
ID: 000389), miR-15b (Assay ID: 000390), miR-16 (Assay ID: 000391) and miR424 (Assay ID: 000604), TaqMan microRNA assay were used according to
manufacturer’s instruction (Applied Biosystems).

multi-detection microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Foldactivation values were measured relative to the levels of Renilla luciferase
activity in cells transfected with negative control oligonucleotides and
normalized by luciferase activities.

Cell viability assays (MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
salt) assays)
MTS assays were performed as reported previously.51

Apoptosis
Quantitation of apoptotic cells was carried out by measurement of sub-G1
DNA content using propidium iodide on a ﬂow cytometer as described
elsewhere.52

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously.53 The
intensity of bands was quantitated relative to corresponding GAPDH bands
with the Bio-Rad VersaDoc image system (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, NSW,
Australia).

Matrigel invasion assays
qPCR analysis of copy number variations
Genomic DNA was extracted with the Genomic DNA extraction Kit
(Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Duren, Germany) according to manufacturer’s
instruction. The quality of DNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The speciﬁc primers used to examine copy number variations of the
fragment (78K–15M) of chromosome 17p13.1 were forward, 50 -CCACCTGG
CAAGAAGTTTGTG-30 ; reverse, 50 -TGTGGTGTTAGAGCGAGGGTG-30 . As a
control, the housekeeping HBB was ampliﬁed and quantitated. The
primers for HBB were forward, 50 -ACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC-30 ; reverse,
50 -CAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC-30 . qPCR was performed using the ViiA 7
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green MasterMix.
Cycle threshold (Ct) values were normalized to the Ct value of HGG.

Array comparative genomic hybridization
One microgram puriﬁed high molecular weight DNA from each pair of
samples was differentially labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 and co-hybridized to
HG18_WG_CGH_v3.1 arrays (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The
array provides measurements from 135 000 unique genomic loci and yields
about 22 176 bp of average probe spacing. The aCGH experimental
procedure was performed by CapitalBio (Capital-Bio Corp., Beijing, China).
aCGH data were extracted and analysed using NimbleScan software and
SignalMap software (Roche Diagnostics). To determine the threshold for
scoring of gain or loss, normalized, log2-transformed ratios were used.
Based on the variation in autosomal genomic regions, which should not
vary between the two reference samples, thresholds for averaged log2
ratio data were set to 0.1 and  0.1 for gains and losses, respectively.

Invasion assays were performed by using QCMTM 24-well Cell Invasion
Assay Kit with 8 mM membrane (Millipore Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany). Cells were seeded at a density of 1  105/chamber well in
triplicate and were allowed to invade through the Matrigel for 48 h. Growth
medium was applied to both sides. Cells that had invaded to the lower
surface of the membrane were dissociated from the membrane, and
subsequently lysed and detected by the patented CyQuant GR dye. The
ﬂuorescence of invaded cells was quantiﬁed by Synergy 2 multi-detection
microplate reader (BioTek) using 480/520 nm ﬁlter set.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel 2003 software.
Two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to assess differences in values
between experimental groups. A P-value of o0.05 was considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant.
