ABSTRACT
Background: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for approximately 3%
of all malignancies. Despite extensive laboratory and imaging efforts, the primary
site usually cannot be unequivocally confirmed, and the treatment for the most part
remains empirical. Recently, identification of common cancer pathway alterations in
diverse cancer lineages has offered an opportunity to provide targeted therapies for
patients with CUP, irrespective of the primary site.
Patients and Methods: 1806 cancers of unknown primary were identified among
more than 63,000 cases profiled at Caris Life Sciences. Multiplatform profiling of
the tumor samples included immunohistochemistry, gene sequencing and in situ
hybridization methods in an effort to identify changes in biomarkers that are predictive
of drug responses.
Results: Biomarkers associated with a potential drug benefit were identified
in 96% of cases. Biomarkers identified included those associated with potential
benefit in nearly all classes of approved cancer drugs (cytotoxic, hormonal, targeted
biological drugs). Additionally, biomarkers associated with a potential lack of benefit
were identified in numerous cases, which could further refine the management of
patients with CUP.
Conclusion: Comprehensive biomarker profiling of CUP may provide additional
choices in treatment of patients with these difficult to treat malignancies.

such cases administration of presumed primary site-specific
therapy remains empirical and for most cases is not driven
by predictive biomarkers  [5]. Recently, identification of
shared, actionable pathway alterations in tumors from
diverse primary sites has offered an opportunity to suggest
pathway-specific therapies independent of tissue lineage
[9–12]. Therefore, one of the most relevant strategies for
effective use of targeted treatment modalities in CUP is
the proper identification of the predictive biomarkers, and
use of individualized therapies driven by those identified
aberrations [13].
In the present study we reviewed 1806 CUP case
data obtained through multi-platform tumor profiling at

INTRODUCTION
Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a
heterogeneous clinicopathologic syndrome constituting 3%
of all malignancies [1]. Historically, CUP was associated
with a poor prognosis [1–4], and patients are offered
limited, non-selective (“broad-spectrum”) treatment choices
[1, 2, 4–6]. Extensive tumor sample investigations to
identify the presumed tissue of origin had been developed,
utilizing gene expression arrays and immunohistochemistry
[3, 4, 7], which may provide an indication of the potential
primary site [8]. However, in true CUP by definition, the
diagnosis of the primary cancer cannot be verified. In all

2 steroid receptors). Loss of the expression of MGMT
[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] was found
in 40% of CUPs. Decreased expression or loss of PTEN
[phosphatase and tensin homolog] was identified in 52%
of cases, while under-expression of TS [Thymidylate
Synthase] was recorded in 64% of the cases.
Protein expression changes that were associated
with a lack of potential benefit to therapeutic agents
were also investigated. The most common changes in
this group were overexpression of MRP1 [multidrug
resistance–associated protein 1] detected in 80% of cases,
and overexpression of BCRP [breast cancer resistance
protein, a member of the superfamily of ABC transporter
proteins] in 75% of cases. ERCC1 [excision repair­
cross-complementation group 1] was overexpressed in
32% of the CUP cases, suggesting potential resistance to
platinum-based chemotherapies.
Programmed cell death receptor (PD-1) and its
ligand (PD-L1), which can be targeted by monoclonal
antibodies (Anti-PD-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475,
and pidilizumab), were studied in 70 recently analyzed
CUP cases. PD-1 expression in tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes and PD-L1 cancer cells’ expression were
observed in 63% and 21% of the cases, respectively.
Co-expression of both markers was detected in 11 out of
70 (16%) tested cases.

RESULTS
Patients’ and tumor sample characteristics
The cohort included 44% male and 56% female
patients with respective mean ages of 61.8 and 63.0 years
(range, 1 to 92) with only 7 patients (~0.4%) under the
age of 20 years. The most common biopsy site was liver
(24%), followed by lymph nodes (17%), skin/soft tissues
(14%), lung (8%), alimentary tract (7%), bones/joints
(6%), and a variety of other sites at less than 5% each.
The diagnosis of CUP was previously established
in all cases from the referring clinicians and institutions;
IHC stains performed at the referring pathology
laboratories did not unequivocally establish the primary
site in any of the cases tested. Upon accessioning, all
cases were reviewed by a board certified pathologist
to verify the adequacy of the sample. The majority of
the cases (82%) were confirmed to be carcinomas, of
which 45% were adenocarcinomas. The remaining 18%
were neuroendocrine tumors (9%), undifferentiated
malignancies (8%) and sarcomas and melanomas (~1%).

Gene alterations (copy number variations,
re-arrangements and mutations)

Biomarker expression and drug associations
In all but 15 cases (<1%) the identified biomarker
aberration resulted in an association with either a benefit
or lack of benefit with known therapeutics. In 96% of
cases, a biomarker was found that identified a therapy of
potential benefit. In 98% of cases, a biomarker was found
that identified a therapy with potential lack of benefit. The
frequencies of associations are shown in Figure 1.

The most commonly amplified genes in our series
were EGFR and HER2 (17% and 5% of the cases,
respectively). cMET and TOP2A were rarely amplified
(1% and 3%, respectively), despite the common expression
of the respective proteins (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Translocations of ALK and ROS1 were not observed in any
cases analyzed (108 and 12 cases, respectively).
The most commonly mutated genes in this CUP
cohort were TP53 and KRAS (38% and 18%, respectively)
with three additional genes that were mutated with
a frequency at ≥5% (BRCA2, PIK3CA, and STK11)
(Figure 3). Although overexpression of EGFR protein
was common (detected in 55% of the cases), EGFR
mutations were identified in only 4 out of 473 CUPs
tested (E746_A750del, L858R, and two with M600T).
A case of activating EGFR mutation (E746_A750del)
was identified in the biopsy of a young woman’s sacrum
(without radiologic evidence of lung or other primary
cancer and equivocal IHC profile, which included diverse
possible primary sites such as upper GI tract, pancreas and
biliary tree, as well as triple-negative breast cancer). She
was treated with erlotinib and had a near-complete clinical
response at 5 months.
Similarly, cKit protein expression was observed in
11% of the cases, while cKIT mutations were found in
only 1% of cases (7 of 559). Six out of 7 detected cKIT

Protein expression
A number of cytotoxic and targeted therapy
responses are dependent on either the presence or
overexpression of a protein or loss of or reduced
expression of a protein. IHC was utilized to assess levels
of protein expression in the specimens. All IHC stains
were reviewed by a board certified pathologist and
interpreted utilizing thresholds published in the literature.
IHC profiling of the protein biomarkers and their drug
associations are outlined in Figure 2.
The most commonly identified protein changes
associated with a potential benefit using targeted
therapies were over expression of two topoisomerases
(Topo1 and Topo2α), identified in 55% and 64% of all
CUPs, respectively. Overexpression of targetable steroid
receptors (estrogen receptor, 8%, progesterone receptor,
9%, androgen receptor, 7%) was seen in 20% of all
CUP cases (4% of cases had co-expression of at least

mutations represented variants of unknown significance.
However, pathogenic cKIT mutation (P551_M552del)
in a neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary
was associated with over-expression of the protein and
the patient received targeted therapy (Imatinib), which
resulted in durable (>46 months) response [14].
Analysis of the BRAF mutated cases (n=24)
showed that 20 cases (83%) were carcinomas (all
positive for pan-cytokeratin and negative for melanocytic
markers [e.g. S-100, Melan-A and HMB-45] by IHC;
5 were suggestive of colorectal primary with CK20
and CDX-2 positivity) while 4 cases (17%) were nonepithelial CUPs (all negative for pan-cytokeratins:
three undifferentiated malignancies and one malignant
melanoma). Evidence of a potential role of EGFR
pathway activation (EGFR protein over expression or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

gene mutation) was seen in 10/19 of these cases (53%);
KRAS mutations were identified in three cases (13%;
Table 2). Of note, EGFR activation and co-mutation with
KRAS favored tumors with non-V600 BRAF mutations.
EGFR overexpression was present in 6/9 non-V600
mutated samples while 3/10 V600 mutated samples had
EGFR overexpression. All three samples with KRAS
co-mutation had non-V600 mutations. This suggests that
non-V600 BRAF mutations may be sufficient to initiate
cancer but may require further alterations in the RAS
pathway for tumor progression, as non-V600 mutations
are not as potent in activating the RAS pathway as V600
mutation in BRAF [15].
Although molecular profiling of CUP has a limited
potential in identifying the primary site of a tumor, in
some cases it can lead to the refinement of the diagnosis.

In a case submitted for analysis as melanoma from an
unknown cutaneous primary site, metastatic to the T10
intradural space, our profiling identified GNA11 Q209L
mutation. This result identified the tumor as a primary
leptomeningeal melanoma because of the characteristic
association between the mutation and this tumor
type [16].

tumor reduction was seen (please see Acknowledgement
section for cases described in the manuscript).
We also note the importance of interpretation of
the biomarker expression within the context of relevant
histologic classification of CUPs. For example, activating
BRAF mutations (e.g. V600E) have been associated
with a benefit using vemurafenib in melanomas, but not
in colorectal carcinomas due to the activation of EGFR
pathway in colon cancer [23]. As Table 2 indicates, we
found BRAF activating mutations in 24 CUP cases, one
of which was a melanoma without evidence for EGFR
pathway alterations while more than half of the remaining
twenty-three cases show potential EGFR pathway
activation, suggesting they may not be ideal candidates for
BRAF targeted mono-therapy. However, such cases may
be considered for the combination therapy targeting both
EGFR and BRAF, as had been described in a patient with
BRAF V600E mutated colorectal cancer [24].
Alterations within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway are among the most frequent in human cancers
[25–27]. Here, we describe frequent alterations of the
pathway including PTEN protein loss and mutations, as
well as PIK3CA mutations, which may provide a rationale
for the targeted therapy with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors
in up to 49% of CUPs.
Recently, PD-1 and PD-L1 have been identified
as potential immune therapy biomarkers not just in
melanomas but also in various solid malignancies including
renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma
[28, 29]. Our study revealed the presence of these two
immune check-point proteins in a subset of CUPs, which
may open an unexplored avenue for the clinical trials with
anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies in these patients.
This study has several limitations. Due to the low
frequency of occurrence of CUP, a lack of prospective clinical
trials exist by which to determine the true clinical significance
of biomarkers tested in our patient cohort. Therefore, we
relied primarily on the available evidence, which consisted
primarily of single case reports. In the absence of robust
clinical studies, case reports may be relevant for treatment
of CUP [30]. Some of the biomarkers investigated in this
study over a period of time have accumulated contradictory
evidence on their predictive role (e.g. ERCC1) [31], which
could be due to differences in analytic and interpretation
platforms. Further, many confounding factors may contribute
to patient response to therapy including gender, age, specific
haplotypes, life style and comorbidities, which all were
beyond the scope of this study.
In conclusion, pathway analysis and identification of
biomarkers for targeted therapies is applicable to CUP and
identifies many individualized treatment options which are
not traditionally considered for CUP. Common molecular
alterations identified in many CUPS indicate a potential
paradigm shift in management of CUP by the inclusion
of pathway driven therapeutic strategies, as supported by
several recently published case reports [14, 18, 19].

DISCUSSION
CUPs pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges
due to uncertain tissue of origin in the era of lineage-based
(histology driven) therapies. However, recent work from
The Cancer Genome Atlas project demonstrated that the
tissue of origin of a cancer may be much less relevant to
prognosis and response to therapy than identification of
causative mutations [17]. These studies identified shared
biomarkers, potentially responsive to drug therapies across
a diverse group of cancers with known primary sites. We
report here that a similar approach should be employed in
cancers of unknown primary sites using comprehensive,
multiplatform biomarker testing.
Sequencing of CUPs detected a limited variety of
genetic mutations (only 5 genes were mutated at ≥5%
frequency) with rather narrow therapeutic (actionable)
applicability. Some of the detected mutations, albeit at low
frequency, have not been previously reported in CUPs,
including cKIT mutations, but may be of clinical relevance
for the patients with refractory, metastatic disease, as
exemplified by a case report where a patient with an
activating KIT mutation and protein overexpression was
successfully treated with sunitinib [14]. Similarly, CUP
cases that harbored activating EGFR mutations were
successfully targeted by EGFR inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib),
as shown in our cohort and in two recent reports [18, 19].
Furthermore, a subset of CUP cases in our cohort harbored
potentially actionable HER2 and EGFR amplifications,
which may benefit from multiple targeted treatment
modalities [20, 21].
For the most part, results of our mutational analysis
are comparable with the data published in two recent
limited studies of CUPs [19, 22].
Our study showed that the vast majority of
druggable targets in CUPs were identified using
established protein biomarkers using standard, widely
available IHC techniques. These biomarkers can be used
to tailor therapeutic modality utilizing conventional
therapies, in addition to targeted biological drugs in CUPs.
For example, we profiled a case of poorly differentiated
carcinoma metastatic to liver (CK+/CK7-/CK20-/TTF1-/
p63+/SYN-/ CD56-) who, after 6 cycles of carboplatin/
paclitaxel had liver recurrence. Caris molecular profiling
identified TOPO1+/Thymidylate synthase- immunoprofile
of the tumor, indicating a potential therapeutic benefit
from irinotecan/5-FU based chemotherapy. The patient
was thus treated with FOLFIRI and at 6 months significant

3%). Multiple profiling of tumors from different sites or at
different times in the same patients was performed in 103
of these cases (6%).

Methods
The Caris Molecular Intelligence (CMI)
tumor profiling service (available at: http://www.
carismolecularintelligence.com/) is a CLIA/CAP/ISO
certified laboratory which utilizes multiple standard
platforms and methodologies, including tumor protein
expression [immunohistochemistry (IHC)] (23 markers,
Figure 2), somatic gene mutation analysis [Nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing,
pyrosequencing, qPCR, and Restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP)]) analysis] (47 genes total, the list
is available at: http://www.carismolecularintelligence.
com/next-generation-sequencing-profile), and tumor
gene copy number alterations [DNA in-situ hybridization:
Fluorescent (FISH) and chromogenic (CISH)] (7 genes:
EGFR, HER2, TOP2A, cMET, PIK3CA, ALK, ROS1),
DNA fragment analysis and in some cases quantitative
mRNA analysis (RT-qPCR) [32].
The associations between a biomarker result and
drug benefit(s) were determined using recommendations
from published clinical evidence in humans, which
includes peer-reviewed literature and/or the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines
[33], not restricted to cancer type. No preclinical or
experimental (unapproved) drug associations were made;
however, biomarker associations to drugs in advanced
stage clinical trials were made.
