ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the
United States. Patients expressing the estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and
PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) tumor markers have favorable
prognosis and efficacious therapeutic options. In contrast, tumors that are negative
for these markers (triple-negative) have a disproportionate share of morbidity and
mortality due to lack of a validated molecular target.
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are a critical component of ubiquitinproteasome-system degradation and have been shown to be differentially expressed
and activated in a number of cancers, including breast, with their aberrant activity
linked to cancer prognosis and clinical outcome. We evaluated the effect of the DUB
inhibitors b-AP15 and RA-9 alone and in combination with early- and late-stage
lysosomal inhibitors on cell viability in a panel of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
cell lines.
Our results indicate small-molecule DUB inhibitors have a profound effect
on TNBC viability and lead to activation of autophagy as a cellular mechanism to
compensate for ubiquitin-proteasome-system stress. Treatment with sub-optimal
doses of DUB and lysosome inhibitors synergistically kills TNBC cells. This supports
the evaluation of DUB inhibition, in combination with lysosomal inhibition, as a
therapeutic approach for the treatment of TNBC.

hormone production and action or agents that inhibit HER2 [2–6]. However, tumors that are negative for ER, PR,
and HER-2 markers, referred to as triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC), account for about 20% of breast cancer in
the Unites States and have a disproportionate share of the
morbidity and mortality. This is likely due to its aggressive
behavior, increased incidence in younger women, and lack
of effective targeted therapies [7–9]. Unfortunately, TNBC
is insensitive to some of the most effective breast cancer
therapies. Given the lack of validated molecular target and
the poor outcome, there is a great need for development of
better therapies in patients with TNBC.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer in women and accounts for over a 40,000 deaths
every year in the Unites States alone [1]. Breast cancer can
be divided into subtypes based on the expression levels
and amplification status of the specific markers estrogen
and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) and human
epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2). This distinction
is clinically relevant as patients that express ER, PR,
and HER-2 have a very favorable prognosis and wider
therapeutic options including agents that interfere with

The ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS) and
lysosomal pathway are two major paths for protein
degradation within eukaryotic cells, responsible for
degradation of short- and long-lived proteins, respectively
[10, 11]. Accumulating evidence suggests a crosstalk
between these two degradation pathways, with the
lysosomal pathway compensating for degradation of shortlived ubiquitinated proteins when USP activity is impaired
[12, 13]. It has been previously shown that, independent
of the genetic causes leading to malignant transformation,
cancer cells exhibit up-regulation of components of protein
degradation pathways [14]. This includes up-regulation of
deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), a critical component
of UPS degradation, which are responsible for removal
of ubiquitin monomers and chains prior to proteasomal
degradation. Members of the DUB family have been
shown to be differentially expressed and activated in a
number of cancer settings, including breast cancer, with
their aberrant activity linked to cancer prognosis and
clinical outcome [15–18]. Importantly, we have recently
shown that targeting ubiquitin-mediated degradation
upstream of proteasomes, whether by targeting DUBs
[19–21] or ubiquitin receptors [22] has preclinical efficacy
without apparent side effects in preclinical models of
ovarian and breast cancer.
Here, we show that treating TNBC cells with the
recently identified small-molecule DUB inhibitors b-AP15
and RA-9 has a profound effect on ubiquitin-dependent
protein degradation and leads to caspase-3 mediated
onset of apoptosis. Mechanistically, b-AP15 and RA-9
treatment leads to autophagy activation as a cellular
mechanism to compensate for unsustainable proteotoxic
stress in breast cancer cells. Lastly, because misfolded and
ubiquitinated proteins are degraded via both proteasomes

and lysosomes, simultaneous inhibition of proteasome and
lysosomal pathways synergistically induces cell death in
TNBC cells. In light of this mechanism, we suggest that
evaluation of DUB inhibition alone or in combination
with lysosomal inhibition is a novel potential therapeutic
approach for treatment of TNBC.

RESULTS
Inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs
induces UPS stress in TNBC cells
The effect of the small-molecule DUB inhibitor
b-AP15 on ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was
evaluated in the TNBC breast cancer cell lines MDAMD-231 and MDA-MB-468. Specifically, breast cancer
cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of b-AP15
(0–20 μM) over a period of 24 hours; the effect on
cellular protein ubiquitination was evaluated by Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1A, b-AP15 treatment
resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in MDA-MB-231 (left panel) and
MDA-MB-468 (right panel) cell lines starting at 5 μM
b-AP15 treatment. Quantification of the changes in highmolecular weight ubiquitin species in each respective cell
line, versus control, is given in Figure 1B (top and bottom
panels). Next, we monitored the rate of poly-ubiquitinated
protein accumulation in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
breast cancer cell lines exposed to 5 μM b-AP15 over a
period of 24 hours. As shown in Figure 1C, immunoblot
analysis revealed a rapid, occurring as early as 4 hours
from drug exposure, and a time-dependent increase of
high molecular weight poly-ubiquitinated species in MDAMB-231 (left panel) and MDA-MB-468 (right panel) cells.

Inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs
induces onset of autophagy

Quantification of the changes in high-molecular weight
ubiquitin species in treated cells versus control is given
in Figure 1D (top and bottom panels). Taken together,
these data suggest that inhibiting proteasome-associated
DUBs severely compromises ubiquitin-mediated protein
degradation in TNBC cells lines.

We have previously shown that inhibition of
proteasome-associated DUBs via small-molecule
inhibitors induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
response as a mechanism to compensate for unsustainable
proteotoxic stress [23]. Here, we evaluated whether
inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs with the specific
inhibitors b-AP15 or RA-9 would trigger autophagy as a
cytoprotective response in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231
cells were transiently transfected with the mCherryGFP-LC3 reporter and exposed to mock (control) or 5
μM b-AP15 treatment for 18 hours. Onset of autophagy
was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. As
shown in Figure 4A, TNBC cells treated with b-AP15
displayed a punctate LC3 localization characteristic
of autophagosome formation. Autophagy activation
following inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs
was further confirmed by measuring protein expression
levels of the LC3-I and LC3-II isoforms by Western blot
analysis. During autophagy, the cytosolic form of LC3
(LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to
form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes.
This causes accumulation of the LC3-II isoform over the
LC3-I isoform [24]. Here, MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 TNBC cells were exposed to increasing doses
of b-AP15 over 18 hours and analyzed by Western blot
with an anti-LC3 antibody to assess levels of both LC3-I
and its lipidated, autophagic vescicle-associated LC3-II
isoform [25, 26]. Consistent with our initial hypothesis
of autophagy activation, b-AP15 treatment caused dosedependent accumulation of LC3-II isoforms in each
cell line (Figure 4B, left and middle panels) and RA-9
treatment caused time-dependent accumulation of LC3II isoforms in MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B, right panel).
We have recently shown that inhibition of ubiquitindependent protein degradation upstream of proteasome
causes activation of ER stress responses in ovarian
cancer cells [27]. To test whether a similar event occurs
in TNBC, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were
exposed to 5 μM b-AP15 over a period of 24 h and the
cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis for the ERstress marker GRP-78. We found that b-AP15 exposure
caused a time-dependent increase in the steady levels of
GRP-78 in both MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4C) and MDAMB-468 cells (Figure 4D). Quantification of the changes
in the steady state levels of GRP-78 in MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells are provided in the right panels of
Figures 4C and 4D, respectively.
Next, we wanted to test whether tested whether
activation of autophagy following DUB inhibition is a
unique event in breast cancer cells or a common feature
in other cancer types. To this end, ES-2 ovarian cancer
cells were exposed to mock, 5 μM RA-9 treatment for

Inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs is
associated with loss of cell viability in TNBC
cells via onset of apoptosis
We and others have previously shown that, due to
their higher requirement for metabolic activity, cancer
cells are highly dependent on proteasome degradation
[12, 20]. Therefore, we sought to test whether
accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated protein following
b-AP15 exposure results in loss of cell viability. To this
end, the highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-435 and weakly invasive MDA-MB-468 cell lines
were exposed to increasing doses of b-AP15 over of 24
and 48 hour period and residual cell viability evaluated
by XTT assay. Our results indicate that exposure to
increasing concentrations of b-AP15 compromised the
cell viability of the breast cancer cell lines tested in a
time-dependent fashion (Figure 2A) with the IC50
ranging from ≅10 to ≅6 μM following 48 hours of drug
exposure (Figure 2B).
To test whether the reduction in cell viability in
TNBC cells following drug exposure is accompanied by
the onset of apoptosis, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
cell lines were exposed to increasing concentrations
of b-AP15 (5–20 μM) over a period of 18 hours. Onset
of apoptosis was evaluated via FACS analysis following
cell double staining with Annexin V and 7-AAD. As shown
in Figure 3A (top and bottom panel), exposure to b-AP15
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the percentage
of double positive cells in MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells respectively. Quantification of the increase
in Annexin-V and 7-AAD double-positive cell populations
following b-AP15 in both cell lines is presented in Figure 3B
(top and bottom panel).
Finally, we measured the levels of cleaved Poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a substrate of
caspase-3, in both cell lines. MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were exposed to increasing doses of b-AP15
over 18 hours and were analyzed by Western blot using
an antibody that recognized both full-length and cleaved
PARP. As shown in Figure 3C (left and right panels),
treatment with b-AP15 resulted in a dose-dependent
accumulation of the cleaved formed of PARP with doses
of 20 μM in both cell lines. Quantification of the ratio
of cleaved PARP to full-length PARP for each dose of
b-AP15 in both cell lines is presented in Figure 3D (left
and right panels). Taken together these data suggest
b-AP15 treatment induces loss of cell viability through
caspase-3 mediated apoptotic cell death in TNBC cells.

amino acid starvation in presence of PBS for a period of
3 h. As shown in Figure 5A, both amino acid starved and
RA-9 treated ovarian cancer cells displayed punctate LC3
localization characteristic of autophagosome formation.
Figure 5B show the percent of cells that contained visible
puncta per each condition. Consistent with the observation
of increased LC3-II levels in TNBC cells following DUB
inhibition, RA-9 treatment also resulted in increased
levels of the LC3-II lipidated form in the ovarian cancer
cell. (Figure 5C). However, because LC3-II degradation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

occurs via autophagy, stabilization of its lipidated isoform
could be the result of autophagy inhibition rather than its
activation. To rule out this possibility, we measured the
autophagic flux cancer cells treated with either b-AP15
and the autophagy inhibitor Chloroquine alone or in
combination. As shown in Figure 5D, blocking the last
step of autophagic flux with Chloroquine prevented the
lysosomal degradation of LC3-II in autophagosomes,
resulting in further LC3-II isoform accumulation in the
ovarian cancer cells. Taken together this strongly suggests
that inhibition of protein-associated DUBs causes onset

tested the effect of exposing TNBC cell lines, including
MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, to
the combination of the proteasome-associated inhibitor
b-AP15 and Vorinostat or Chloriquine over a period
of 48 hours. As shown in Figure 6A, analyses of cell
death indicated synergistic activity for the b-AP15 and
Vorinostat combination in all of cell lines tested, with

killing with CIs of 0.84, 0.83 and 0.78 for MDA-MB-435,

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, respectively, though
to a lesser extent. These data indicate that rather than a
simple additive killing, the combination of a DUB and
lysosome inhibitor is highly to moderately synergistic.
To further confirm that inhibition of autophagy
is responsible for the increased cell killing observed
following DUB inhibition and Vorinostat and Chloroquine
treatment, we took advantage of knock-down technology
to selectively knock-down Beclin-1, which is known
to regulate autophagy by promoting the fusion of the
autophagosomes to the lysosomes [29]. Specifically
Beclin-1 was knocked down in MCF-7 breast cancer cells
and the effect on protein levels was evaluated via Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6B (top panel) Beclin-1
expression levels were reduced by 60% in Beclin-1 shRNA
cells as compared to control. Next, Beclin-1 and control
knockdown cells were exposed to escalating concentrations
of the DUB inhibitor b-AP15 over a period of 48 hours
and residual cell viability measured via WST-1 assay as we
previously described [27]. As shown in Figure 6B (bottom
panel) Beclin-1 knockdown MCF-7 breast cancer cells
show a statistically significant higher degree of sensitivity
to b-AP15 as compared to the parental cells. Importantly,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line expresses both the
estrogen and the progesterone receptor, thus suggesting
that concomitant inhibition of DUBs and autophagy could
be used as a therapeutic option for patients whose tumors
are hormone sensitive.
We have previously shown that activation of
autophagy is a cytoprotective event to limit proteasome
inhibitor-induced cell death [13] and that inhibition of
proteasome-associated protein degradation via proteasome
inhibitors is associated with the formation of aggresomes.
Therefore we performed immunofluorescence analysis to
investigate the fate of poly-ubiquitinated protein following
DUB inhibition. Specifically, the GFP-LC3 expressing ES-2
ovarian cancer cell line was treated with b-AP15 (5 μM),
Vorinostat (20 μM) or combination of both for 18 hours
and the sub-cellular localization of LC3, was visualized
by immunofluorescence. As shown on Figure 6C, b-AP15
treatment led to the visualization of LC3 localization
characteristic of autophagosome formation while Vorinostat
treatment did not cause significant LC3 accumulation.
Simultaneous treatment with b-AP15 and Vorinostat, on
the other hand, caused the appearance of poly-ubiquitinated
proteins at multiple punctate sites throughout the cytoplasm.

This is consistent with a cytoprotective role of autophagy
following DUB inhibitor treatment.

The proteasome- and lysosome-mediated protein
degradation are the two mechanisms for protein
degradation within eukaryotic cells. Under physiological
circumstances these two evolutionarily conserved
mechanisms for protein degradation work independently,
the first being responsible for the degradation of over 90%
of short-lived proteins the latter being responsible for
degradation of long-lived proteins. A cross-talk between
proteasome- and lysosome-mediated protein degradation
has been suggested in cancer, signifying that proteasomeand lysosome-assisted protein degradation are functionally
coupled.
In support of this hypothesis, our results indicate
treatment of TNBC cells with sub-optimal concentrations
of the DUB inhibitors b-AP15 and RA-9 causes activation
of autophagy as a mechanism for cells to escape to
unsustainable levels of UPS stress. Importantly activation
of autophagy occurs well before onset of apoptosis,
suggesting that activation of autophagy is a protective
cellular mechanism to decrease the levels of proteotoxic
stress rather than cause cellular death.
Lastly, we wanted to explore whether
pharmacological inhibition of proteasome-associated
DUBs have the potential as part of combination
treatment for TNBC patients. Our results indicate that
pharmacological inhibition of DUB function via the
small-molecule b-AP15 and of autophagy via Vorinostat
or Chloroquine induces synergistic cell killing in a panel
of TBNC cells with CIs ranging from 0.51–0.84, providing
justification for further exploration of this combinatorial
treatment as a therapeutic agents for TNBC.

DISCUSSION
Independent of the genetic components that
predispose individuals to breast cancer, malignant
transformation is accompanied by progressive cellular
adaptation to cope with increasing levels of metabolic
stress inherent to the cancer phenotype [12–14, 30, 31]
and targeting of these compensatory mechanisms results
in selective killing of cancer cells.
DUBs are a large family of proteases responsible
for removing ubiquitin (monomers and chains) from the
substrates prior to their degradation by proteasomes.
This is needed for proper protein homeostasis as deubiquitination is essential for degradation of proteins by
proteasomes. DUBs represent attractive and novel “drugable” targets for cancer as they are substrate specific and
directly responsible for controlling the steady levels of
proteins crucial for maintaining the malignant phenotype.
Recent evidence suggests a link between activation
status of certain DUB family members and cancer
progression and chemoresistance in a number of cancer
settings, including breast cancer [16–18], thus supporting
the concept of DUBs playing a crucial role in cancer
development and its outcome. Studies have also suggested
that pharmacological inhibition of DUBs decreases
tumor burden and increases overall survival in xenograft
models of human cancers [15, 22, 32–34], supporting the
feasibility of targeting DUBs for cancer treatment
To assess the feasibility of inhibiting DUBs for
TNBC treatment we initially evaluated the effect of the
recently identified small-molecule DUB inhibitors RA-9
and b-AP15 on ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation
and cell viability in a panel of TNBC cell lines. Our data
show that protracted UPS stress following exposure to
suboptimal concentration of DUB inhibitors cause doseand time dependent proteotoxic stress in TNBC cell lines
which is consistent with a decrease in cell viability at
pharmacologically achievable concentrations.
A number of recent studies suggest that DUBs are
responsible for deubiquitinating of a number of cell cycle
regulators and consequent regulation of their steady state
levels [35]. For instance, DUBs have been proposed to
play a critical role in regulating NF-κB pathway [36],
TGFβ signaling [37] as well as p53 and MDM2 [38]
levels and activity suggesting that DUB dysregulation is a
frequent event in cancer.
Our present study shows that treatment of TBNC
cells with the DUBs inhibitor b-AP15 causes dosedependent caspase-3 activation and apoptosis both of
which occurs well after onset of proteotoxic stress,
suggesting that apoptosis mediated cells death is a
consequence of unsustainable levels of UPS stress in
breast cancer cells following DUBs inhibition.

monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and as previously described [12].
Data analysis was performed using CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System).

Cell viability assay

The combination index (CI) of b-AP15 and
Vorinostat or Chloriquine was calculated by the method
of Chou and Talalay [42] and further regression analyses
were performed to stabilize estimates. CI < 1 indicates
synergism, CI = 1 indicates additivity, and CI > 1 indicates
antagonism.

Statistical analysis

Cell viability was determined by 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt
(WST-1, Cayman Chemicals) assay as previously described
[19, 41]. Briefly, cells were seeded at the concentration
of 1,000 per well in 100 μL medium in 96-well plate and
treated with the indicated concentrations of drugs. At the
indicated time points, cells were incubated according
to the manufacturer’s protocol with the WST-1 labeling
mixture for 2 hours. Formazan dye was quantified using a
spectrophotometric plate reader to measure the absorbance at
450nm (ELISA reader 190; Molecular Devices).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Antibodies and western blot analysis

DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL
CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

Total cellular protein (10–20 μg) from each sample
was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF
membranes and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Antibodies for Western blot analysis were obtained by
the following commercial sources: anti-ubiquitin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PARP (BD Pharmingen), antiLC3 (Cell Signaling) anti–β-actin (Sigma), anti-Beclin-1
(Abcam), anti-GRP-78 (Cell signaling). Peroxidase-linked
anti-mouse Immunoglobulin G and peroxidase-linked antirabbit Immunoglobulin G were from Amersham.

The authors declare no conflict of interests.
