ABSTRACT
The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a variety of cancers, including
gastric cancer, which has one of the highest mortality rates of all human cancers.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been suggested to have important causal
roles in gastric cancer. However, the interaction between lncRNAs and EBV has
not yet been studied. To this end, we sequenced 11,311 lncRNAs and 144,826
protein-coding transcripts from four types of tissue: one non-EBV-infected gastric
carcinoma (EBVnGC) and its adjacent normal tissue, and one EBV-associated gastric
carcinoma (EBVaGC) and its adjacent normal tissue. Five lncRNAs showed EBVaGCspecific expression; of those, one (SNHG8) was validated using real-time PCR in an
independent cohort with 88 paired gastric cancer and adjacent tissue samples. To
explore the functions of SNHG8, we identified its mRNA targets on the lncRNA–mRNA
co-expression network of the Illumina Body Map, which contains the RNA sequencing
data of mRNAs and lncRNAs from 16 normal human tissues. SNHG8 lncRNA was found
to affect several gastric cancer-specific pathways and target genes of EBV. Our results
reveal the intertwined tumorigenesis mechanisms of lncRNA and EBV and identify
SNHG8 as a highly possible candidate biomarker and drug target of gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are with
≥ 200 nt but without open reading frames (ORFs). Many
studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs have diverse
biological functions, such as regulating epigenetic
modulation, transcription, and translation [5, 6], and
that they are dysregulated in various cancers [7–10].
Furthermore, lncRNAs are being increasingly recognized
as master regulators of cancer [6, 8, 11].
In gastric cancer, lncRNA dysregulation is
associated with larger tumors, greater tumor invasion,
more widespread metastasis, and lower survival rates
[12, 13]. For example, expression of the lncRNA PANDAR
(promoter of CDKN1A antisense DNA damage activated
RNA) is greater in cancerous tissue than in adjacent

Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer
worldwide and ranks second on the cause list of cancer
death. [1]. It is a complex and highly heterogeneous
disease. One type of gastric cancer is Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC), which
constitutes almost a tenth of all gastric carcinomas [2].
EBV is absent in noncancerous mucosa but present in all
cancer cells, and has a clonal nature in neoplastic cells;
therefore, it is considered to have a causal role in gastric
carcinoma [2, 3]. EBVaGC has been well-characterized
molecularly and genomically [4]. However, the pathogenic
mechanism of EBVaGC remains poorly understood.

healthy tissue, and ectopic expression of this promoter is
associated with various measures of cancer severity [14].
Another study showed that overexpression of the lncRNA
H19 promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and
metastasis of gastric cancer [15]. However, there have
been no reports investigating lncRNAs in EBVaGC.
Deep sequencing is a high-throughput technique that
enables rapid and comprehensive exploration of a large
number of lncRNAs and can be used to identify sequence
variations and discover novel lncRNAs [16, 17]. Here,
we used deep sequencing to examine the lncRNAs and
protein-coding transcripts in four samples: EBVaGC and
its adjacent normal tissue, and non-EBV-infected gastric
cancer tissue (EBVnGC) and its adjacent normal tissue.
Five lncRNAs were specifically expressed in EBVaGC.
Analysis of lncRNA and mRNA co-expression and
virus–host interactions revealed that the lncRNA SNHG8
interacts with EBV proteins and regulates several important
target genes that affect downstream cancer pathways.

The lncRNAs specifically expressed in EBVaGC
tissue were identified using criteria of ≥ 5-fold change
between FPKM values of the EBVaGC sample and the
other three tissues (EBVnGC sample, EBVaGC adjacent
sample, EBVnGC adjacent sample). Five EBVaGCspecific lncRNAs were identified: RNU12, H19, SNHG8,
RP11-359D14.3, and MIR143HG (Table 1).

Polymerase chain reaction validation of the
EBV-specific lncRNA SNHG8
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to further validate
the expression levels of the five EBV-specific lncRNAs in
a cohort of 88 patients with gastric cancer, with primers
designed in Primer Premier 5.0 software (Supplementary
Table S1). The RP11-359D14.3 primer was difficult to design
and was removed after unsatisfactory quality control results.
There were no pathological differences between the gastric
carcinoma samples used for RNA sequencing and those used
for RT-PCR validation (Supplementary Table S2). SNHG8
expression was concordant with the lncRNA sequencing
assay. The RT-PCR results of non-significant lncRNAs,
RNU12, H19 and MIR143HG are shown in Supplementary
Figures S1–S3. Notably, SNHG8 expression in EBVaGC
was significantly higher than in EBVnGC (Figure 2) and in
EBVaGC adjacent tissue (Figure 3).

RESULTS
EBVaGC definition
EBVaGC is a lymphoepithelioma-like, diffusetype carcinoma with dense lymphocytic infiltration. It
is identified by the expression of EBV-encoded small
ribonucleic acid 1 (EBER1) in cancer cell nuclei, using
in situ hybridization. Lymphoid stroma surrounds the
EBER1-positive nuclei (Figure 1).

Biological functions of SNHG8 target genes

Whole genome lncRNA and mRNA expression
profiles

Next, we identified the target mRNAs of SNHG8 by
analyzing its coexpression with mRNAs according to the
Illumina Body Map dataset. Using the online gene function
annotation tool DAVID [21], which includes numerous
annotation categories such as Gene Ontology (GO) and
KEGG Pathways, we explored the functions of the target
genes of SNHG8 (Table 2). These results indicated that
SNHG8 targets pathways such as hsa03010 (ribosome),
GO:0006412 (translation), GO:0045449 (regulation of
transcription), GO:0006350 (transcription), GO:0008380
(RNA splicing), GO:0016071 (mRNA metabolic process),
GO:0008134 (transcription factor binding), GO:0003677
(DNA binding), and GO:0030528 (transcription regulator
activity). Notably, many of these functions, such as
“transcription” and “mRNA metabolic process”, were wellknown pathways or processes targeted by EBV [22–24].

Ultra-high-depth RNA sequencing data sets were
generated from two tumor samples (EBVaGC sample with
70.6 million pair-end reads; EBVnGC sample with 65.2
million pair-end reads) and two matched normal samples
(EBVaGC adjacent sample with75.5 million pair-end reads;
EBVnGC adjacent sample with 53.5 million pair-end reads).
A Trim Galore! Cutadapt wrapper (v1.9.dev6) was
used to trim raw sequencing reads, and low quality bases
(< Q20) were removed using Trimmomatic v0.32 [18].
FastQC v0.11.3 was used to evaluate the qualities of the
raw sequencing data and the trimmed data by analyzing
base quality, GC content and sequence length distribution.
TopHat2 v2.1.1 [19] was used to align the trimmed reads
to the human genome (GRCh37) with reference annotation
from Gencode v19. More than 90% of reads were mapped
and over 85% of reads were uniquely mapped. rRNA
genes were masked, and Cufflinks v.2.2.1 [20] was
used to generate transcriptome assemblies. Transcriptlevel expression was measured as FPKM (fragments
per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped).
The average numbers of expressed genes and transcripts
(FPKM > 1) were 14,360 and 24,505, respectively.

Relationship between SNHG8 and EBV in
EBVaGC
We further investigated the relationship between
SNHG8 and EBV by analyzing the co-expression between
host human mRNAs and EBV mRNAs. We used an EBV
genomics dataset to identify target mRNAs of EBV genes.

Using the hypergeometric statistical test, we evaluated
the overlap between EBV target genes and SNHG8 target
genes. The enrichment results (Table 3) show that SNHG8
interacts significantly with EBV genes such as BHLF1, LF3,
BHRF1, and BNLF2a.
The EBV genes BHLF1 (BamHI H leftward reading
frame 1) and LF3 (leftward reading frame 3) consist of
repetitive sequences of 125 and 102 bp, respectively.
They are both found in the polyribosomal fraction of cells
infected with EBV and expressed transcriptionally in virusassociated tumors [25]. There is evidence that BHLF1 and
LF3 are associated with the lytic replication cycle, which
seems to take place mainly in epithelial cells. This type of
replication is essential for the spread of the virus, and its
suppression maintains the tumor phenotype [26].
BHRF1 has 38% primary sequence homology with
the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and shares three of its
four conserved regions (Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains,
BH1–BH3) [27]. The functions of BHRF1 are also similar
to those of Bcl-2, and it imparts anti-apoptotic protection

to EBV-infected cells [28], allowing the development of
virus persistence and facilitating oncogenesis.
BNLF2a is another early lytic gene, and encodes
a tail-anchored protein situated in the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum [29]. The BNLF2a protein has two
domains: a hydrophilic, cytosolic N-terminal domain and
a hydrophobic, membrane-spanning C-terminal domain
[30]. Both domains are required for immune escape, which
involves the disruption of viral peptide transport into the
endoplasmic reticulum and of peptide loading onto human
leukocyte antigen class I molecules; this disruption leads
to lower levels of endogenous antigen presentation, thus
preventing recognition by CD8+ T-cells [30, 31].

EBV target genes with the same expression
pattern as SNHG8
The target genes of EBV that are also targeted by
SNHG8 are listed in Table 3. As described above, SNHG8
expression in EBVaGC was significantly higher than in

The highly conserved gene EIF4A2 is a member of
the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A family, and encodes a
protein synthesis initiation factor for binding mRNA to
the ribosome. EIF4A2 is involved in the progression of
breast cancer and melanoma [37] and in the development
of non-small-cell lung cancer, and has been suggested as a
potential prognostic marker [38].
Nucleosome assembly protein-1 (Nap1) plays a role
in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, as well as
nucleosome assembly [39, 40]. Nap1-like 1 (Nap1L1) is
highly homologous to Nap1 and shares some functions
with it, such as nucleosome assembly, although it also
has a more active role in nucleosome disassembly [40].
Nap1L1 is overexpressed in certain tumors such as
hepatoblastoma [41] and carcinoid of the small intestine
[42]. It epigenetically promotes tumor cell proliferation
in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms by inhibiting the
tumor suppressor p57Kip2 and the mTOR pathway [43].

EBVnGC and adjacent tissues. Next, we explored the
target genes for EBV and SNHG8, and identified those
that showed the same expression pattern: EBVaGC
FPKM expression level ≥ 5 and greater expression than in
EBVnGC and in EBVaGC adjacent tissue (Table 4).
TRIM28, also known as KAP1 and TIF1b, is a
universal co-repressor that mediates transcriptional
control by interacting with Krüppel-associated box zinc
finger proteins [32, 33]. TRIM28 is an essential partner
in several multiple-protein complexes and has a variety
of functions including the regulation of pluripotency
and proliferation [34, 35]. It participates in epithelial–
mesenchymal transition via the regulation of histone
acetylation and methylation on E- and N-cadherin
promoters in lung cancer cell lines. TRIM28 is involved
in cancer progression; it is overexpressed in colorectal and
gastric cancer and is an independent prognostic factor for
poor overall and relapse-free survival [36].

PLD3 encodes a lipase family protein associated
with the endoplasmic reticulum, which is widely
expressed in the brain, including in the hippocampus and
most of the cortex [44, 45]. PDL3 has been implicated
in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and might contribute
to a range of cellular functions including differentiation,
epigenetic modification, neurotransmission, and signal
transduction [44, 45].
Ribosomal protein L18a (RPL18A) is a component
of the eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit (60S). RPL18A
interacts with the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry
site (IRES) and might be involved in IRES-mediated
translation and viral replication [46, 47].

including breast carcinoma and head/neck cancer [52–54].
Furthermore, TRPM7 might regulate exocrine pancreatic
development, and aberrant TRPM7-mediated signaling
contributes to the development of pancreatic cancer [54].

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have evaluated the profiles
of lncRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in EBVaGC, and
confirmed expression levels of the lncRNA SNHG8 by
RT-PCR. The putative functions of SNHG8 were explored
by examining co-expression of lncRNA and mRNAs.
Mounting evidence suggests that lncRNAs, initially
considered transcriptional noise, play pivotal roles in
carcinogenesis [11, 55]. In gastric cancer, the dysregulation
of several lncRNAs is associated with tumorigenesis,

transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOT-AIR), one of the
most widely known lncRNAs, was shown to be associated
with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in patients
with gastric cancer. HOT-AIR also promotes invasion and
epithelial–mesenchymal transition by directing polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to silence HOXD9 [57,
58]. Homeobox A transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP)
is markedly overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and

stage and overall survival. Furthermore, overexpression of
HOTTIP was identified as an independent poor prognostic
factor for patients with gastric cancer. Together, this
indicates that lncRNAs are an excellent prospect as a new
type of biomarker [56]. Our study also shows that SNHG8
expression was markedly elevated in EBVaGC tissues
compared with normal control samples.
It has long been accepted that small nucleolar
RNAs (snoRNAs) guide RNA in post-translational
ribosomal RNA modification processes [59, 60]. However,
80995

accumulating evidence suggests that these non-coding
RNAs might play a much more important role in cell fate
determination and oncogenesis than previously thought
[61, 62]. In patients with gastric cancer, SNHG5 was
significantly downregulated and associated with TNM
stage [63]. Furthermore, SNHG20 was upregulated in
hepatocellular carcinoma and, in an in vitro study, its
suppression distinctly inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [64]. SNHG8,
located on 4q26, is thought to encode the smaller
snoRNAs. Our study showed that SNHG8 expression
in EBVaGC tissues is markedly elevated compared with
normal control samples.
EBV is a lifelong latent infection present in more
than 90% of the human population and has been linked
etiologically to a wide range of human malignancies [65].
EBV-encoded proteins, such as EBV nuclear antigen 1
and latent membrane proteins, can alter gene expression,
accelerate growth, increase survival, and facilitate invasion
of transformed cells [66, 67]. A number of viral non-coding
RNAs have also been linked to latent EBV infection; for
example, EBV BamHI-A rightward transcripts (BARTs), a
family of alternatively spliced mRNAs expressed in EBV
latency programs, are closely associated with clinical
and pathological measures of tumor progression [68].
BART1 induces metastasis via PTEN-dependent pathway
regulation [69]; BART3 promotes cell growth by its action
on deleted in cancer 1 (DICE1) [70]; and BART5 inhibits
apoptosis by modulating the pro-apoptotic protein p53

upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) [71]. This
suggests that EBV plays a causal role in the development
of malignancies, metastasis of tumors, and evasion of the
host immune system.
EBVaGC
has
unique
clinicopathologic
characteristics, including better prognosis than EBVnGC.
Several well-recognized viral genes such as BHRF1,
BLLF1, BRLF1, BZLF1, EBNA1, and LMP2A are highly
expressed in EBVaGC [72, 73]. Expression of LMP2A
is involved in the upregulation of survivin protein and
causes genome-wide aberrant methylation in host cells
[74]. Patients with EBVaGC show typical genetic and
epigenetic alterations, and approximately 205 host cell
genes are usually mutated including AKT2, CCNA1,
MAP3K4, and TGFBR1 [74].
In our study, the lncRNA SNHG8 was expressed
in an EBV-specific manner. SNHG8 expression in
EBVaGC was higher than in EBVnGC and in EBVaGC
adjacent tissue. Based on our analysis of SNHG8 and
EBV targets, we propose a theory of how SNHG8 triggers
gastric cancer (Figure 4). SNHG8 interacts with the
EBV proteins LF3, BHLF1, BHRF1, and BNLF2a and
regulates the expression of TRIM28, EIF4A2, NAP1L1,
PLD3, RPL18A, and TRPM7. Functional analysis of
TRIM28, EIF4A2, NAP1L1, PLD3, RPL18A, and
TRPM7 suggested that they play direct roles in gastric
cancer. This reveals the regulatory roles of lncRNAs and
viruses in gastric carcinoma, and contributes to a more
comprehensive understanding of tumorigenesis.

Figure 4: SNHG8, EBV, and their targets in EBV-associated gastric cancer. Co-expression and enrichment analysis showed that

SNHG8 interacted with the EBV proteins LF3, BHLF1, BHRF1, and BNLF2a. These proteins in turn regulated the expression of TRIM28,
EIF4A2, NAP1L1, PLD3, RPL18A, and TRPM7, which play important roles in gastric cancer pathways, contributing to processes such as
DNA repair, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and ribosomal function.

v2.1.1 [19] was used to align the trimmed reads to the
human genome (GRCh37) with reference annotation from
Gencode v19. More than 90% reads were mapped while
over 85% reads were uniquely mapped. rRNA genes were
masked, and transcriptome assemblies were generated
using Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) [20].

Patient and tissue samples
RNA deep sequencing samples
Two gastric cancer tissues (one EBVnGC and one
EBVaGC) and their pair-matched adjacent gastric tissues
were obtained from two patients at Fujian Provincial
Cancer Hospital. The patients were male with poorly
differentiated stage IIIB adenocarcinoma and lymph node
metastasis.

Criteria for defining EBV-specific lncRNAs
EBV-specific lncRNAs were defined by fold
changes (≥ 5) between FPKM values of the EBV-positive
tumor sample and the other three samples.

Validated samples

Real-time RT-PCR assay

Eighty-eight patients, including 39 with EBVaGC,
were included in this study. They took gastric carcinoma
resection from July 2012 to April 2015. The patients (69
males and 19 females) had a median age of 58.2 years
(ranging from 22.0 to 79.0 years) and had a median tumor
size of 5.5 cm (1.0–15.0 cm). None of them received
chemotherapy before surgery. Fresh stomach tumor tissues
and their adjacent non-tumorous tissues were obtained
immediately after tumor resection. One portion of the
tissues was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and then stored at −80°C; and the other portion was ﬁxed
in 10% buffered formalin and then embedded in parafﬁn.
Lauren’s criteria [75] was used to determine the histologic
subtypes of the tumors. EBVaGC was identified by in situ
hybridization for EBER1 (Dako, Denmark) (Figure 1) [76].
The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital,
China. Informed consent from all patients was obtained
before participation.

Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the
sequencing results. Total RNA from 88 paired gastric
cancer and adjacent tissues was treated with DNaseI
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) to eliminate any genomic
DNA contamination. Reverse transcription for lncRNAs
was performed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Takara, Japan). The cDNA template was amplified by
real-time RT-PCR using the SYBR Green Master Mix
(Roche, USA). Primers were designed using Primer
Premier 5.0 software. Real-time RT-PCR reactions were
performed in triplicate on the ABI7500 system (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA).
Using the comparative Ct method 2−ΔΔCt [79, 80]
and gastric carcinoma sample No. 9 as a calibrator, the
relative expression levels in all gastric carcinoma samples
and adjacent non-tumorous tissues were quantified.
Expression levels of lncRNA were normalized to β-actin
mRNA expression.

Identification of mRNA targets of lncRNAs

Sequencing and assembly

To identify the mRNA targets of lncRNAs, we
analyzed the RNA sequencing dataset of the Illumina
Body Map [81], which included 16 normal human tissues.
Expression levels of 14,886 lncRNAs from the LNCipedia
database [82] and 21,721 protein-coding genes from
UCSC hg19 [83] were calculated using TopHat [84] and
Cufflinks [85] with default parameters. If the expression
level of a protein-coding gene was correlated with that of
a lncRNA with an absolute Pearson correlation coefficient
> 0.5, they were deemed a co-expression pair. The coexpressed mRNAs were considered to constitute the
microenvironment around the lncRNA and were used to
annotate the functions of the lncRNA.

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was examined by
gel electrophoresis and only high quality RNA was used
for subsequent analysis. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared
using an Illumina HiSeq 3000 sequencing system with a
50 bp single-end protocol (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA) [77]. In total, there were 52 and 59 million 2 × 150
paired-end reads of the paired GC/control mucosa RNA
samples [77, 78].
The raw sequencing reads were analyzed with
Trim Galore! Cutadapt wrapper v1.9.dev6 (http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)
and Trimmomatic v0.32 [18]: the adapters were trimmed
with the Trim Galore! Cutadapt wrapper using the –paired
option, and low quality bases (< Q20) were removed
with Trimmomatic. FastQC v0.11.3 (http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was used
to manually evaluate the qualities of the raw and trimmed
sequencing data by checking per base quality, per base
GC content and sequence length distribution. TopHat2

Identification of human target genes of EBV
proteins
The target genes of EBV proteins were obtained
from EBV Genomics (https://ebv.wistar.upenn.edu) [86].
We downloaded the human gene expression levels and
EBV expression levels in 201 samples, and then calculated

Enrichment between lncRNA and EBV
Enrichment between lncRNA and EBV genes can
be represented by the hypergeometric test P value [87–89]
of the target gene of lncRNA, L(i), and the target gene of
EBV, V(j), which can be computed by:

M  N −M 

where N represents the total number of human genes,
M and n represent the number of target genes of EBV gene
j and the number of target genes of lncRNA i, respectively,
and m represents the number of lncRNA target genes
that also target genes of EBV gene j. The smaller the
P value for a lncRNA and an EBV gene, the stronger the
suggested association between them. The hypergeometric
test P value was adjusted to the false discovery rate using
the Benjamini method [90]. A false discovery rate of
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Gastric cancer is an important malignancy with
high morbidity and mortality rates and many risk factors.
EBV is known to occur often in gastric cancer samples,
but certain lncRNAs are also emerging as risk factors for
cancer, although their precise roles in the disease remain
unclear. To identify the key lncRNAs and investigate
their functions and interactions with EBV, we sequenced
one EBVnGC tissue and its adjacent normal tissue, and
one EBVaGC and its adjacent EBV-associated tissue.
The lncRNA SNHG8 was expressed in an EBV-specific
manner. Co-expression network analysis revealed
significant interactions of SNHG8 and EBV LF3, BHLF1,
BHRF1, and BNLF2a. Together, these factors regulate
several functional genes in gastric cancer, such as TRIM28,
EIF4A2, NAP1L1, PLD3, RPL18A, and TRPM7. This
regulatory pathway model of lncRNA, virus, and target
genes provides novel insights into gastric tumorigenesis
and suggests potential drug targets for intervention.
