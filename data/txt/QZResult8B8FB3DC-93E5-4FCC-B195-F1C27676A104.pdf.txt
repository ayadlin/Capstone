Abstract
Tumors contain a heterogeneous myeloid fraction comprised
of discrete MHC-IIhi and MHC-IIlo tumor-associated macrophage
(TAM) subpopulations that originate from Ly6Chi monocytes.
However, the mechanisms regulating the abundance and phenotype of distinct TAM subsets remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)
in TAM differentiation and polarization in different mouse tumor
models. We demonstrate that treatment of tumor-bearing mice
with a blocking anti-M-CSFR monoclonal antibody resulted in a
reduction of mature TAMs due to impaired recruitment, extravasation, proliferation, and maturation of their Ly6Chi monocytic
precursors. M-CSFR signaling blockade shifted the MHC-IIlo/
MHC-IIhi TAM balance in favor of the latter as observed by the

preferential differentiation of Ly6Chi monocytes into MHC-IIhi
TAMs. In addition, the genetic and functional signatures of
MHC-IIlo TAMs were downregulated upon M-CSFR blockade,
indicating that M-CSFR signaling shapes the MHC-IIlo TAM
phenotype. Conversely, granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSFR
had no effect on the mononuclear tumor inﬁltrate or relative
abundance of TAM subsets. However, GM-CSFR signaling
played an important role in ﬁne-tuning the MHC-IIhi phenotype. Overall, our data uncover the multifaceted and opposing
roles of M-CSFR and GM-CSFR signaling in governing the
phenotype of macrophage subsets in tumors, and provide new
insight into the mechanism of action underlying M-CSFR
blockade. Cancer Res; 76(1); 35–42. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Ly6Chi monocytes differentiate into distinct TAM subsets with
specialized functions and a different intratumoral localization:
normoxic M1-like MHC-IIhi TAM and hypoxic M2-like MHC-IIlo
TAM (3, 4). As hypoxia is not the main driver of TAM inﬁltration
and differentiation (4), we considered myelopoietic growth factor
receptor signaling as governor of TAM heterogeneity. In this
respect, M-CSF–driven macrophage activation leads to the expression of a substantial part of the M2 transcriptome, while granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces a
M1 phenotype (5, 6). As such, blocking M-CSFR (CSF1R, CD115)
signaling in myometrial macrophages stimulated the occurrence
of an M1-like MHC-IIhi population at the expense of M2-like
MHC-IIlo macrophages in the pregnant mouse uterus (7). M-CSFR
signaling was recently also shown to be critical for TAM
differentiation and shaping the M1/M2 TAM phenotype (8–
11). However, which aspects of the monocyte-to-TAM differentiation pathway are inﬂuenced by M-CSFR and whether GM-CSF
also skews the TAM phenotype remain largely unexplored (12).
Using mouse tumors of different histologic origin, we show
here, that Ly6Chi monocytes depend on M-CSFR signaling for
their recruitment and extravasation to tumors and differentiation
to mature TAM. M-CSFR signaling governs the phenotype of M2like MHC-IIlo TAM, and its blockade resulted in a preferential
differentiation of monocytes to M1-like MHC-IIhi TAM. Although
GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR, CSF-2R, or CD116) signaling is not
determining monocyte recruitment and differentiation, it ﬁne
tunes the molecular proﬁle of MHC-IIhi TAM, hence uncovering

Tumors are often highly inﬁltrated with inﬂammatory cells
such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs are now
considered to promote tumor growth in multiple ways, including
induction of angiogenesis, remodeling of the extracellular matrix,
stimulation of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, and inhibition of adaptive immunity (1), the clinical signiﬁcance of which
is evidenced by the correlation between high TAM density and
worse outcome in most cancer types (2).

isotype control/PECy7 (eB149/10H5; eBioscience) as was
described before (7, 13).

Materials and Methods

Intravital imaging
Intravital imaging was performed following a previously
reported protocol (14) with minor modiﬁcations (Supplementary Information).

Detailed Materials and Methods can be found in the Supplementary Information
Mice, cell lines, and tumor models
Female C57BL/6 mice and ubiquitin-GFP mice (C57BL/6) were
purchased from Janvier and Jackson, respectively. Cx3cr1gfp/þ
(C57BL/6), GM-CSFR/ (Csf2rb/) (C57BL/6), Il4ra/
(C57BL/6), and MMTV-PyMT (FVB) mice were respectively provided by Frank Tacke (Aachen University, Germany), Melanie
Greter (University of Zurich, Germany), Frank Brombacher (University of Cape Town, South Africa), and Massiliano Mazzone
(KULeuven, Belgium). Procedures followed the guidelines of
the Belgian Council for Laboratory Animal Science. C57BL/6 or
Balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 3  106 3LL-R
Lewis lung carcinoma or TS/A breast carcinoma cells, respectively.
Tumor preparation, ﬂow cytometry, and cell sorting
Tumor single-cell suspensions were prepared as described (3).
Antibodies for cell surface staining are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. To prevent aspeciﬁc binding, TAMs were preincubated
with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (2.4G2, BD Biosciences). Delta
median ﬂuorescence intensity (DMFI) was calculated as: (MFI
staining)  (MFI isotype staining). FACS data were acquired using
a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo
(Tree Star, Inc.). To purify monocytes or TAM, cells were sorted
using a BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) from 4 to 8 pooled
tumors or pooled blood from 6 to 8 mice.
Anti–M-CSFR antibody administration
Anti–M-CSFR antibody (300 mg per intravenous injection;
clone AFS98) or isotype control antibody [anti-human CD44
Hermes-1 (rat IgG2a)] producing hybridomas were originally
provided by Miriam Merad and antibodies were prepared inhouse. Treatment schedules of mice are listed in the legend of each
ﬁgure. Brieﬂy, mice were either treated every two days starting
from tumor inoculation or received one shot of antibody before
sacriﬁce depending on the experiment.
Measurement of IL34, M-CSF, GM-CSF, and CCL2 production
Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines were measured
by ELISA following the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems;
see Supplementary Information).
Adoptive bone marrow and monocyte transfers
Blood and bone marrow Ly6ChiGFPþ monocytes were sorted
from ubiquitin-GFP mice. A total of 106 cells were intravenously
injected in 3LL-R tumor-bearing mice. The fate of the GFPþ
progeny was determined 48 hours later. For bone marrow adoptive transfers, 107 bone marrow cells from ubiquitin-GFP mice
were injected 4 hours before checking GFPþLy6Chiþ monocyte
presence in blood and tumor.
Extravasation of monocytes
Mice were intravenously injected 1 minute before sacriﬁce with
1 mg rat anti-CD45/PeCy7 (30-F11; eBioscience) or rat IgG2b

In vitro phagocytosis assay
For in vitro latex uptake, freshly isolated tumor single-cell
suspentions were cultured for 40 minutes at 4 C (control) or
37 C, in the presence of yellow–green latex microspheres (Polysciences; 0.5 mm) diluted 1:5,000. Latex uptake by tumor CD11bþ
Ly6G cells was assessed via ﬂow cytometry.
Bromodeoxyuridine labeling
Tumor-bearing mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of
1 mg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) 4 hours before sacriﬁce.
Tumors were collected and BrdUrd intracellular staining was
performed following the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences; Supplementary Information).
RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and quantitative real-time
PCR
These experiments were performed as described before (3).
RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and was reverse
transcribed with oligo(dT) and SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen).
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in an iCycler, with iQ
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S2. PCR cycles consisted of 10 94 C, 4500
55 C, 10 72 C. Gene expression was normalized using ribosomal
protein S12 (Mrps12) as a housekeeping gene.
Statistical analysis
Signiﬁcance was determined by the Student t test or ANOVA
followed by a post test using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. A P
value < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. All graphs
show mean  SEM.

Results
M-CSFR signaling blockade impairs the extravasation of tumorinﬁltrating Ly6Chi monocytes
Treatment with blocking anti-M-CSFR monoclonal antibody
(mAb) AFS98, but not an isotype control mAb, caused a significant reduction of the CD11bþLy6GSiglecF inﬁltrate in subcutaneous 3LL-R lung carcinoma tumors (Fig. 1A, gating strategy in
Supplementary Fig. S1A), subcutaneous TS/A mammary carcinoma tumors, and transgenic MMTV-PyMT mammary carcinomas
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To assess whether anti-M-CSFR treatment impaired the extravasation of monocytes into 3LL-R tumors, we injected anti-CD45/
PECy7 intravenously to label all intravascular hematopoietic cells
(7, 13) and one minute later (a time span that is too short for
labeled cells to extravasate) quantiﬁed labeled versus unlabeled
Ly6Chi monocytes in excised tumors. Signiﬁcantly, more Ly6Chi
monocytes remained in the tumor vasculature upon M-CSFR
blockade (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These ﬁndings were corroborated via intravital microscopy of anti-M-CSFR–treated tumors in
CX3CR1gfp/þ mice (Fig. 1B). Reduced monocyte recruitment and
extravasation could be secondary to an anti-M-CSFR–mediated

decrease in local CCL2 production, as was demonstrated before in
other tissues (7). However, when GFPþ bone marrow cells were
transferred intravenously to tumor-bearing mice pretreated with
anti-M-CSFR, the recruitment of GFPþLy6Chi monocytes into
tumors was not signiﬁcantly reduced compared with control
mAb–pretreated mice, arguing against major chemoattractant
alterations caused by anti-M-CSFR (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, CCL2
protein levels in the tumor were not inﬂuenced by M-CSFR
blockade (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
To assess whether M-CSFR signaling blockade has monocyteintrinsic effects, GFPþ bone marrow cells were pretreated with
anti-M-CSFR in vitro before transfer into tumor-bearing mice.
Signiﬁcantly less anti-M-CSFR–bound GFPþLy6Chi monocytes
could be traced back in the tumor (Fig. 1C). Importantly, their
numbers did not differ in peripheral blood, excluding monocyte
elimination in the circulation as underlying mechanism for their
reduced tumor penetrance (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Notably,
the expression of adhesion molecules known to be involved in

monocyte extravasation (15) were not affected by anti-M-CSFR
(Supplementary Fig. S1F). Hence, M-CSFR blockade lowers
monocyte recruitment and extravasation to tumors in a monocyte-intrinsic fashion.
M-CSFR signaling blockade impairs the proliferation of
peripheral and tumor-inﬁltrating Ly6Chi monocytes
M-CSFR signaling may drive monocyte proliferation and as
such contribute to tumor-inﬁltrating mononuclear cell numbers.
BrdUrd pulse labeling in combination with an intravenous injection of CD45-PeCy7 1 minute before sacriﬁce revealed that the
proliferative capacity of Ly6Chi monocytes in isotype-treated mice
dropped while migrating from peripheral blood (11.7%  2.5%)
to the tumor vasculature (4.8%  0.9%) and ﬁnally to the tumor
mass (0.27%  0.05%; Fig. 1D). In all sites, the proliferation of
Ly6Chi monocytes depended on M-CSFR signaling, as it signiﬁcantly dropped after M-CSFR blockade (Fig. 1D). Of note, costaining with AnnexinV/7AAD revealed that M-CSFR antibody

treatment had no effect on the viability of Ly6Chi monocytes nor
TAM subsets (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, M-CSFR signaling
blockade impairs the recruitment and proliferation of Ly6Chi
monocytes, resulting in a reduced mononuclear tumor inﬁltrate.
Notably, the amount of Ly6Chi monocytes was unaltered in the
peripheral blood and spleen and was even increased in the bone
marrow after M-CSFR blockade (Supplementary Fig. S3), possibly
resulting from the combined effect of a lower proliferation rate
and reduced recruitment to the tumor.
M-CSFR signaling blockade impedes the differentiation of
Ly6Chi monocytes into MHC-IIlo TAM
We next assessed whether M-CSFR signaling affected the differentiation pathway of the Ly6Chi monocytes that were still able
to inﬁltrate the tumor. Upon anti-M-CSFR treatment, proportionally more monocytes and immature TAM (gates 1 þ 2 þ 3) and
less mature TAM (gates 4 þ 5, with especially a strong effect on
MHC-IIlo TAM in gate 4) were found within the CD11bþ
Ly6GSiglecF tumor inﬁltrate (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig.
S4A and S4B), suggesting a monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation block. This conclusion is corroborated by the diminished
gene expression level of the macrophage differentiation regulators
Pu1.1 and Mafb in tumor-associated Ly6Chi monocytes from antiM-CSFR–treated mice (Fig. 2B). In this context, it is important to
note that especially M-CSF, but much less the alternative M-CSFR

ligand IL34, is secreted in the tumor microenvironment (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and that blocking the M-CSFR tends to reduce
the presence of this cytokine in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Interestingly, mainly the generation of MHC-IIlo TAM was
hampered upon M-CSFR blockade, as the MHC-IIlo/MHC-IIhi
TAM balance shifted from an excess of MHC-IIlo TAM towards
equal amounts of both TAM subsets (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S4). Notably, also the presence of tumor-associated dendritic
cells (gate 6) was not affected. Accordingly, the differentiation
pathway of adoptively transferred GFPþLy6Chi monocytes shifted
from yielding mainly MHC-IIlo TAM in isotype-treated mice to
predominantly MHC-IIhi TAM upon anti-M-CSFR treatment (Fig.
2C). Importantly, the altered MHC-IIlo/MHC-IIhi TAM balance
caused by M-CSFR blockade was also seen in TS/A (Supplementary Fig. S6).
M-CSFR and GM-CSFR signaling play opposing roles in
determining the phenotype of MHC-IIlo and MHC-IIhi TAM
Finally, we wondered whether M-CSFR signaling also inﬂuences the phenotype of the mature TAM subsets. Both MHC-IIlo
and MHC-IIhi TAM expressed the M-CSFR, but the expression level
in MHC-IIlo TAM was signiﬁcantly higher (Fig. 2D), possibly
explaining the greater sensitivity of this subset to M-CSFR blockade. When analyzing a panel of genes we previously identiﬁed as
being associated with the distinct TAM subsets, it became clear

M-CSF and GM-CSF Receptor in Determining the TAM Phenotype

that most (but not all) MHC-IIlo TAM-associated genes (3, 4),
such as Mrc1, Arg1, Cd163, and Mmp9 were downregulated in the
MHC-IIlo TAM upon M-CSFR inhibition, while several MHC-IIhi
TAM-associated genes, such as Mgl2, Cdh1, Cldn1, Retnla, Ptgs2,
and Ccl17 were upregulated in these cells (Fig. 3A). Hence, MCSFR blockade enhanced the MHC-IIhi TAM gene signature in
MHC-IIlo TAM. Accordingly, the protein expression level of markers highly expressed on MHC-IIlo TAM (MMR, SR-A and IL4Ra)
signiﬁcantly dropped after M-CSFR blockade (Fig. 3B). The drop
in IL4Ra expression may imply that part of the anti-M-CSFR–
mediated effects on gene expression are due to diminished IL4Ra
signaling. Although some genes were indeed regulated by IL4Ra
in the tumor microenvironment, the effects of M-CSFR blockade
are largely maintained in IL4Ra-deﬁcient mice and are thus IL4/
IL13-independent (Supplementary Fig. S7). Notably, the inherent
phagocytic capacity of the MHC-IIlo TAM, which is one of its
hallmark functions (3), was strongly diminished by M-CSFR

blockade as evidenced by lower uptake of latex beads ex vivo (Fig.
3C). In addition, the capacity of both MHC-IIlo and MHC-IIhi
TAM to stimulate na€ve CD4þ and CD8þ T cells was increased
following M-CSFR blockade, further evidencing a functional shift
(Supplementary Fig. S8).
M-CSF and GM-CSF were reported to have opposing effects on
the macrophage activation state (5, 6). Both TAM subsets
expressed high levels of the GM-CSFR, with the highest expression
seen on the MHC-IIhi population (Fig. 2D). To assess whether
GM-CSF regulates the TAM phenotype, 3LL-R tumors were inoculated in GM-CSFR–deﬁcient mice. Notably, the abundance of
the mononuclear tumor inﬁltrate was comparable between GMCSFR KO and WT tumors, the Ly6Chi monocytes expressed similar
levels of maturation markers (Fig. 3D) and the relative abundance
of TAM subsets was unaltered (Fig. 3D). These data illustrate that
GM-CSF does neither regulate monocyte extravasation nor their
intratumoral differentiation. However, several genes that are

highly expressed by MHC-IIhi TAM (3, 4), such as Mgl2, Cdh1,
Cldn1, Retnla, Ptgs2, Ccl17, and IL1b were strongly downregulated
in GM-CSFR KO MHC-IIhi TAM (Fig. 4A). Conversely, genes that
are typically associated with the MHC-IIlo TAM were either
unchanged or upregulated in the GM-CSFR KO MHC-IIhi population (except Arg1). A similar general trend was observed in GMCSFR KO MHC-IIlo TAM (Fig. 4A). At the protein expression level,
the MHC-IIhi TAM marker CD11c dropped in GM-CSFR KO
MHC-IIhi TAM, while surface markers associated with a MHC-IIlo
TAM signature (IL4Ra, MMR, and SRA) increased or remained
unaltered (Fig. 4B). In addition, the phagocytic capacity of both
TAM subsets was enhanced in the absence of GM-CSFR, while
having no effect on the Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4C).
Interestingly, treatment of GM-CSFR–deﬁcient mice with
blocking anti-M-CSFR mAb caused a signiﬁcant reduction of the

CD11bþLy6GSiglecF tumor inﬁltrate (Supplementary Fig.
S9A), hampered the generation of MHC-IIlo TAM (Supplementary
Fig. S9B), and enhanced the MHC-IIhi TAM gene and protein
signature in MHC-IIlo TAM (Supplementary Fig. S9C and S9D),
similar to blocking M-CSFR signaling in WT mice (Figs. 1A, 2A,
and 3A and B). Hence, the induction of a more M1-like TAM
phenotype upon M-CSFR blockade is GM-CSF–independent.
Together, these data validate the distinct role of M-CSFR and
GM-CSFR signaling in macrophage polarization in tumors in vivo
(Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Strong reductions in the number of TAM have been reported in
various tumor models upon blocking M-CSFR signaling using

M-CSF and GM-CSF Receptor in Determining the TAM Phenotype

several M-CSFR blockers (12). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this study, we show that MCSFR, but not GM-CSFR, signaling, is responsible for the recruitment, extravasation, proliferation, and maturation of tumorinﬁltrating Ly6Chi monocytes. The exact mechanism by which
M-CSFR signaling regulates monocyte extravasation remains
unknown, but appears not to be CCL2 driven like in some other
tissues (7). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
process of extravasation is driven by other M-CSFR–regulated
chemokines in these tumors. Another M-CSFR–regulated molecule, involved in monocyte and macrophage migration and
activation is the GTPase Rac2 (16), which could be an interesting
candidate for further investigation.
We also show that M-CSFR, but not GM-CSFR, inhibition
abrogated the differentiation of Ly6Chi monocytes to M2-like
MHC-IIlo TAM. M-CSFR blockade was previously shown to induce
a shift in phenotype from MHC-IIlo to MHC-IIhi TAM in a
syngeneic mouse model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma (9),
to drive the repolarization of protumoral M2 to M1 TAM in a
mouse glioblastoma model (8) and to cause the preferential
depletion of M2-like MMRhi TAM (10). Notably, M2-like
MMRhi TAM may be MHC-IIhi in some models and are also
depleted by M-CSFR blockade (11, 17). Overall, these data suggest
that M-CSFR blockade preferentially depletes mature M2-like
TAM. Administration of M-CSFR blocking mAbs to patients with
diffuse-type giant cell tumors even led to clinical responses,
validating M-CSF and its receptor as a therapeutic target (18).
We now show for the ﬁrst time that M-CSFR and GM-CSFR
signaling are in fact opposing driving forces in the tumor microenvironment, regulating the MHC-IIlo and MHC-IIhi TAM phenotype, respectively. While M-CSFR predominantly regulated the
differentiation and M2-like properties of MHC-IIlo TAM in a GMCSFR–independent fashion, GM-CSFR ﬁne-tuned the M1-like
MHC-IIhi phenotype. A differential expression of the respective
receptors may mediate part of this effect. However, as distinct TAM
subsets are differentially located within the tumor, with the MHCIIlo TAM associated with more hypoxic regions (3, 4), a locoregional production of M-CSF and GM-CSF in different compartments of the tumor microenvironment may also be involved.
Interestingly, many of the genes that were shown to be regulated

by GM-CSFR in MHC-IIhi TAM in the current study were reported
before as typical GM-CSF–induced genes in bone marrow–
derived macrophages in vitro (Cldn1, Cdh1, Ccl17, IL1b; ref. 19).
Hence, even in the complex tumor microenvironment harboring a
multitude of potential macrophage-regulating cues, M-CSFR and
GM-CSFR signaling are important for skewing macrophage
polarization.
