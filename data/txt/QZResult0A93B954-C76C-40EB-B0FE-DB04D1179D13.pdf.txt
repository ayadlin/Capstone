BACKGROUND: The secondary epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation Thr790Met (T790M) accounts for approximately
half of acquired resistances to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Recent reports have demonstrated that the emergence of T790M
predicts a favorable prognosis and indolent progression. However, rebiopsy to confirm T790M status can be challenging due to limited tissue availability and procedural feasibility, and little is known regarding the differences among patients with or without T790M
mutation. METHODS: The study investigated 78 EGFR-mutant patients who had undergone rebiopsy after TKI failure. The peptide
nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method was used in EGFR mutational analyses. Various patient
characteristics and postprogression survivals (PPSs) after initial TKI failure were retrospectively compared in patients with and without T790M. RESULTS: The T790M mutation was identified in 4 (17%) of 24 central nervous system lesions, and in 22 (41%) of 54 other
lesions (P 5.0417). No other characteristics had a statistical association with T790M prevalence. Median PPS was 31.4 months in 26
patients with T790M, and 11.4 months in 52 patients without T790M (P 5.0017). In the multivariate analysis, statistically significant factors for longer PPS included T790M-positive, good performance status, and no carcinomatous meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of T790M in central nervous system lesions was rare, compared with other lesions. Patients with T790M after TKI failure
appear to have better prognoses than those without T790M. TKI rechallenge or continuous administration beyond progression may

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers, and the majority are already unresectable and metastatic upon their initial diagnosis. Cytotoxic chemotherapies such as platinum-based regimens were the primary therapeutic option in metastatic NSCLC, but
their advancement has reached a plateau. Recently, molecular targeted therapies have been developed and have provided a
remarkable benefit to patients harboring specific genetic alterations. Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been identified in patients with radiographic responses to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs).1,2 Currently, the efficacy of upfront EGFR-TKIs has been established for patients harboring EGFR-sensitive
mutations in prospective randomized phase 3 trials, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is approximately 12
months.3-7 Despite an initial dramatic response, most patients harboring EGFR mutations acquire resistance to EGFRTKIs. Several resistance mechanisms have been identified,8-13 and the secondary EGFR mutation, a point mutation in
exon 20 (T790M) accounts for approximately half of acquired resistances to EGFR-TKI. Recent reports have

demonstrated that the presence of T790M predicts a
favorable prognosis and indolent progression, compared
to the absence of T790M after TKI failure.14 However,
rebiopsy to confirm T790M status can be challenging due
to limited tissue availability and procedural feasibility,15
and little is known regarding the differences among
patients with or without T790M.
We conducted this study to compare various patient
characteristics between T790M-positive and T790Mnegative populations, and to investigate the prognosis in
patients who underwent rebiopsy by analyzing postprogression survival (PPS) after initial TKI failure. We also
examined therapeutic strategies with TKI after initial TKI
failure such as TKI rechallenge or continuous administration beyond progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Between May 2008 and October 2012, we retrospectively
investigated 78 patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations who had undergone rebiopsy to confirm the emergence of T790M after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI.
Acquired resistance was defined as Jackman et al previously proposed.16 In the criteria, response or durable stable disease (> 6 months) was confirmed on TKI followed
by progression while receiving TKI. Patients who reported
never having smoked in their lifetime were defined as
never smokers; those who had smoked within 1 year of diagnosis were categorized as current smokers; and the rest
were considered former smokers. Informed consent
regarding EGFR mutational analysis was obtained from
all patients.

specimens, on which it is difficult to perform precise pathological examinations, and we did not routinely conduct
an immunohistochemical staining for small cell carcinoma, even in tissue specimens.
Comparison Between T790M-Positive and
T790M-Negative Populations

Patient characteristics (age, sex, smoking history, performance status, EGFR mutation site, initial TKI,
response to initial TKI, line of initial TKI, PFS with initial TKI, and biopsy site) and PPSs after initial TKI failure, were retrospectively compared in patients with and
without T790M. PPS was herein defined as the period
from progressive disease (PD) on initial TKI therapy to
death. We also divided the T790M prognosis analysis
into patients with carcinomatous meningitis and patients
without. Multivariate analysis of PPS was performed on
selected variables based on univariate analysis and important clinical factors.
TKI Use After Acquired Resistance to Initial
EGFR-TKI

We examined therapeutic strategies with TKI after initial
TKI failure such as TKI rechallenge or continuous administration beyond progression. The efficacy of TKI rechallenge was analyzed in the cohort of our present study. We
adopted the data on initial TKI rechallenge if the patients
received TKI rechallenge in multiple lines. Those who
had received another TKI without TKI-free interval after
initial TKI failure were categorized as patients who underwent TKI rechallenge.
Statistical Analysis

EGFR Mutational Analysis

Rebiopsy was performed at various sites using various procedures in the above 78 patients at our institutes. We isolated tumor DNA from these 78 specimens, and EGFR
mutations were analyzed using the peptide nucleic acidlocked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
clamp method, as previously reported by Nagai et al.17
Seven patients received rebiopsies at multiple sites, and
the initial analyses were adopted. Almost all mutation
analysis was performed in malignant-cell-confirmed
specimens, but 2 cytology-negative cerebrospinal fluids
(CSFs) revealed EGFR mutations. This study was
designed to investigate the association between T790M
status and relevant clinical factors or survival. No other
acquired resistant molecular mechanisms (eg, MET) were
examined, nor did we examine a transformation to small
cell carcinoma. Many of our samples were cytological
4326

PD of initial TKI was judged by each doctor in charge,
according to clinical progression or objective progression
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1. PFS was defined as time until PD
or death, and PPS was defined as date from PD on initial
TKI until death. Each patient characteristic was compared
between T790M-positive and T790M-negative patients
using Fisher’s exact test. PPS and PFS curves were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. PPSs and
PFSs were compared between T790M-positive and
T790M-negative patients using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis of PPS was performed using the proportional hazards model, and a backward stepwise approach
was adopted for our variable selection. A P value < .05
was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical
analysis was performed using JMP 7 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between May 2008 and October 2012, we retrospectively
investigated 78 patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations who had undergone rebiopsy to confirm the emergence of T790M after exhibiting acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKI. At the initial mutational analyses, the types
of EGFR mutation observed before the initial TKI
included 42 (54%) deletional mutations in exon 19, 33
(42%) L858R point mutations in exon 21, and 3 (4%)
point mutations in exon 18 (G719X). Rebiopsy was performed at various sites using various procedures in the
above 78 patients at our institutes. Median interval
between initial TKI progression and rebiopsy was 4.1
months (range, 0-60.1 months). Table 1 shows the details
of the rebiopsy sites, specimens, procedures, and T790M
prevalence. Because of their easy accessibility and practical
necessity, serous effusions such as CSF and pleural effusion account for more than half of the specimens.
T790M Prevalence

Relevant patient characteristics and T790M prevalence
were compared (Table 2). T790M was identified in 4
(17%) of 24 central nervous system (CNS) (20 CSF and 4
brain tissue) specimens, and in 22 (41%) of 54 other
lesions (26 lung tissue, 25 pleural effusion, and 3 lymph
node) (P 5 .0417). Other characteristics had no statistical
association with the detection of T790M. Almost all sensitizing EGFR mutations detected in rebiopsy specimens
were concordant with pretreatment mutations, but only
one cytology-positive sample revealed EGFR wild-type,
despite L858R at the initial analysis.
Comparison of PPS Between T790M-Positive
and T790M-Negative Populations

The comparison of PPS between T790M-positive and
T790M-negative populations is shown in Fig. 1. The median
PPS of the T790M-positive group (n 5 26) was 31.4 months
(95% confidence interval [CI] 5 20.6-51.7 months), and

(n 5 6) was 22.6 months (95% CI 5 1.9-undeterminable
months), and that of the T790M-negative group (n 5 28)
was 11.2 months (95% CI 5 8.1-17.8 months)
(P 5 .0567). In 44 patients without carcinomatous meningitis, the median PPS of the T790M-positive group
(n 5 20) was 45.4 months (95% CI 5 21.6-undeterminable months), and that of the T790M-negative group
(n 5 24) was 14.5 months (95% CI 5 9.7-26.8 months)
(P 5 .0117).
TKI Use After Acquired Resistance to Initial
EGFR-TKI

None of our patients received a chronic TKI continuation
after initial TKI failure. Some patients (12 of 78) were
considered to have oligoprogressive disease after initial
4328

TKI failure,18,19 but none of them received the same TKI
continuation after local ablative therapies.
Fifty-nine (76%) of the 78 patients underwent TKI
rechallenge. We investigated the efficacy of TKI rechallenge. Twelve of 59 patients achieved partial response
(PR), and 23 stable disease, resulting in response rate
(RR) and disease control rate (DCR) of 20.3% (95%
CI 5 11.0-32.8%) and 59.3% (95% CI 5 45.8-71.9%),
respectively. Median PFS of the 59 patients was 2.7
months (95% CI 5 1.8-4.8 months).
We analyzed the association between T790M status
and the efficacy of rechallenge, though examination periods of T790M status were variable. The RR in patients
with T790M (n 5 18) was 16.7%, and without T790M
(n 5 41) 22.0% (P 5 .7388). The DCR in patients with
T790M was 66.7%, and without T790M 56.1%
(P 5 .5685). Median PFS of patients with T790M was

T790M 2.7 months (95% CI 5 1.4-4.8 months)
(P 5 .4170) (Fig. 3).
We also analyzed the association between a TKIfree interval and the efficacy of rechallenge. Median
TKI-free interval was 1.8 months (range, 0-28.2
months). The RR of TKI rechallenge with TKI-free
interval < 6 months was 22.2% (8 of 36, PR), and
> 6 months, 17.4% (4 of 23, PR). The DCR < 6
months was 63.9%, and > 6 months, 52.2%. Median
PFS < 6 months was 2.7 months, and > 6 months,
2.3 months. No statistical significance was confirmed
in the RR, DCR, and PFS.
Sixteen patients had carcinomatous meningitis
when initial TKI rechallenge was administered. Eight
(50%) of 16 patients obtained clinical benefit (magnetic resonance imaging response and/or improvement
of neurological symptoms) from TKI rechallenge.
Multivariate Analysis of PPS

Multivariate analysis of PPS was performed on variables
selected by univariate analysis and important clinical factors. The results of the proportional hazards model are
shown in Table 3. We identified 3 factors associated with
the duration of PPS using a backward stepwise approach
for variable selection. T790M status (positive versus negative, P 5 .0077, HR 5 0.66, 95% CI 5 0.46-0.90), PS
(0-1 versus 2-4, P 5 .0166, HR 5 0.69, 95% CI 5 0.690.94), and carcinomatous meningitis (with versus without, P 5 .0368, HR 5 1.46, 95% CI 5 1.02-2.09) were
statistically significant factors in determining the duration
of PPS.

DISCUSSION
In our present data, the median PPS in the T790Mpositive population (n 5 26) was 31.4 months, and in the
T790M-negative population (n 5 52) it was 11.4 months
(P 5 .0017). Oxnard et al reported the median PPS in the
T790M-positive population (n 5 58) to be 19 months,
and in the T790M-negative population (n 5 35) it was 12
months (P 5 .036), findings that represent similar results
from a Caucasian population.14 Notably, preclinical data
have shown more indolent growth of T790M-positive
cancer cells than parental cell lines.20 Uramoto et al also
found the 5-year survival rate of T790M-positive patients
(n 5 8) to be 87.5% and that of T790M-negative patients
(n 5 11) to be 14.8% (P 5 .01) in a Japanese population.21 T790M-positive status was a statistically significant (P 5 .0077) factor for longer PPS in our multivariate
analysis, taking confounding factors into consideration.
Although our data included many patients with carcinomatous meningitis, better prognosis in patients with
T790M was demonstrated, even in a limited population
without carcinomatous meningitis. Our data validate the

clinical value of T790M as a prognostic marker in EGFRmutant NSCLC after initial TKI failure.
Our study showed that T790M was identified in 4
(17%) of 24 CNS specimens, and in 22 (41%) of 54 other
lesions, mainly thoracic lesions (P 5 .0417). This result
suggests that the emergence of T790M in CNS is rare
compared with other lesions. The low incidence of
T790M implies the existence of other specific resistance
mechanisms in CNS. This is partially due to poor drug
penetration into the CNS. Some recent reports demonstrated the efficacy of high-dose EGFR-TKIs in refractory
CNS lesions after the failure of standard-dose EGFRTKIs.22-27 In preclinical data, T790M-negative cancer
cells have accelerated growth potential and frequently
metastasize to extrathoracic sites including CNS.14,20
Poor TKI exposure to CNS may induce T790M-negative
rapid growth cells in CNS, resulting in poor prognosis. In
our study, T790M-positive patients without carcinomatous meningitis obtained remarkably longer PPS than
other cohorts. Thus, the importance of sufficient TKI exposure to CNS was suggested, and better control of CNS
metastases may contribute to longer survival.
Many patients (76%) in our study underwent TKI
rechallenge after initial TKI failure. Although the efficacy
of TKI rechallenge was reported to be moderate (response
rate of 0%-10%, disease control rate of 30%-50%, and
median PFS of 2-3 months),28-30 some patients can
obtain much more clinical benefit from TKI rechallenge.
It is important to identify such patients, and some reports
have demonstrated several clinical factors that can predict
the efficacy of TKI rechallenge. Heon et al demonstrated
that 16 patients with a longer TKI-free interval (> 6
months) were able to obtain greater benefit from erlotinib
rechallenge than 8 patients with a shorter TKI-free interval ( 6 months) (median time to progression: 4.4
months versus 1.9 months, P 5 .026).28 We also previously showed that higher efficacy of TKI rechallenge with
erlotinib after gefitinib failure can be achieved with proper
patient selection criteria, including good PS, a benefit
from prior gefitinib treatment, and the insertion of cytotoxic chemotherapies between gefitinib and erlotinib
therapies.31 Preclinically, Chmielecki et al demonstrated
that T790M is mediated by TKI exposure, and TKI withdrawal reduces the proportion of T790M-harboring cells
in an EGFR-mutant tumor.20 Oxnard et al proposed that
resistant tumors are likely to be a mixed population of
TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant cells, and upon withdrawal of the selective pressure from TKI, previously
arrested TKI-sensitive cells can repopulate more quickly
than TKI-resistant cells, and tumors may regain their
4330

sensitivity to TKI.32 Considering these reports, longer
TKI-free intervals (presumably interspersed with cytotoxic chemotherapies) may reduce TKI-resistant clones,
and induce the restoration of EGFR-TKI sensitivity.
Unfortunately, our data did not show the efficacy of
rechallenge was associated with T790M status or TKI-free
interval. Several studies23,31 and our data suggested notable effectiveness of TKI rechallenge for carcinomatous
meningitis. We believe that a sophisticated TKI rechallenge therapy can provide a survival benefit in patients
after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI.
Many of our patients received TKI rechallenge, but
almost no patients underwent a chronic TKI continuation
after initial TKI failure. On the other hand, Oxnard et al
continued EGFR-TKIs in 80% to 90% of cases even after
initial TKI failure, to prevent the growth of TKI-sensitive
clones in their clinical practice.14 As we mentioned above,
TKI withdrawal reduces T790M-positive indolent
growth cells and induces repopulation of T790Mnegative accelerated growth cells.20 Based on these phenomena, TKI continuation beyond progression may be
reasonable for the maintenance of indolent T790Mpositive cells and the prevention of repopulation of
T790M-negative accelerated growth cells. Some recent
reports have suggested the efficacy of TKI continuation
beyond progression. Nishie et al showed that the continuous use of EGFR-TKI beyond progression prolonged
overall survival in their retrospective analysis.33 The median overall survival was 32.2 months in 39 patients continuing EGFR-TKI, and 23.0 months in 25 patients
switching to chemotherapy, which represents a significant
difference between the 2 groups (P 5 .005). Cox analysis
also showed that continuous EGFR-TKI after progression
(HR 5 0.42, 95% CI 5 0.21-0.83, P 5 .013) was associated with improved survival. Oxnard et al investigated a
total of 42 patients after acquired resistance to erlotinib.34
Their results suggested the effectiveness of postprogression erlotinib continuation with or without local therapies
such as radiation and surgery. Nineteen (45%) and 9
(21%) patients were able to delay alternate systemic therapy for more than 3 and 12 months, respectively. Similarly, Weickhardt et al exhibited the efficacy of local
ablative therapy with TKI continuation for oligoprogressive disease.19 In patients with oncogene-addicted
NSCLC having oligoprogressive disease, local ablative
therapy with TKI continuation was associated with more
than 6 months of additional disease control. Preclinical
and clinical data support the continuation of TKI beyond
progression, and prospective trials are needed to confirm
the effectiveness of this strategy.

Prognostic Impact of T790M Mutation/Hata et al

Our study includes several limitations. First, our
data set is small in size, and the data are retrospective.
RR and PFS are very soft endpoints, and the interval
for the restaging imaging was highly variable, and this
represents a bias for PFS assessment. Second, our data
were limited to cases who were able to undergo
rebiopsy. Cases exhibiting an extremely poor general
condition after initial TKI failure were excluded. In
addition, the data were limited to cases who had targetable lesions on which rebiopsy could be performed.
We included no cases without targetable lesions, which
would probably be cases with a relatively small tumor
burden and would have a better prognosis than those
with targetable lesions. Third, the different intervals
between the initial TKI progression and rebiopsy might
have affected the T790M status. In our data, the median interval between initial TKI progression and
rebiopsy was 4.1 months (range, 0-60.1 months). Early
rebiopsies were frequently performed in cases with carcinomatous meningitis or pleuritis. Lumbar puncture
and thoracocentesis were necessarily done in our routine clinical practice to diagnose carcinomatous meningitis or pleuritis. The majority of our patients
underwent rebiopsies before TKI rechallenge to examine their T790M status, and these patients received a
rebiopsy 4 to 6 months after the initial failure of
EGFR-TKI. On the other hand, some patients were
rebiopsied after a long TKI-free interval. Interestingly,
some recent reports have suggested that T790M can
disappear and become undetectable by PCR methods.13,35 The prevalence of T790M (outside CNS) in
our study (41%) was slightly lower compared with pivotal data (approximately 50%).13 Variation in the
TKI-free interval and the interval between initial TKI
progression and rebiopsy may affect the prevalence of
T790M. Fourth, our study does not address other
mechanisms of resistance besides T790M. Several other
resistant mechanisms have been identified,36 and their
prognoses may be different after acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKI.
In conclusion, the emergence of T790M in CNS
was rare compared with other lesions. Patients with
T790M after TKI failure appear to have better prognoses
than those without T790M. To obtain a better prognosis
in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, more effective therapeutic
strategies for refractory CNS metastases, including highdose EGFR-TKI therapy, should be developed. Moreover, more sophisticated TKI rechallenge or continuous
administration beyond progression may contribute to
longer survival. Further investigations are warranted to

develop more optimal treatment strategies after acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKI.
