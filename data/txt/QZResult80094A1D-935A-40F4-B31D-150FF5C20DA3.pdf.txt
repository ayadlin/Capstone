Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in humans and will on average affect up to one
in eight women in their lifetime in the United States and Europe1. The Women’s Health Initiative
and the Million Women Study have shown that hormone replacement therapy is associated with
an increased risk of incident and fatal breast cancer2,3. In particular, synthetic progesterone
derivatives (progestins) such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), used in millions of women
for hormone replacement therapy and contraceptives, markedly increase the risk of developing
breast cancer. Here we show that the in vivo administration of MPA triggers massive induction of
the key osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) in

mammary-gland epithelial cells. Genetic inactivation of the RANKL receptor RANK in
mammary-gland epithelial cells prevents MPA-induced epithelial proliferation, impairs expansion
of the CD49fhi stem-cell-enriched population, and sensitizes these cells to DNA-damage-induced
cell death. Deletion of RANK from the mammary epithelium results in a markedly decreased
incidence and delayed onset of MPA-driven mammary cancer. These data show that the RANKL/
RANK system controls the incidence and onset of progestin-driven breast cancer.
RANKL (also known as ODF, TRANCE, OPGL and TNFSF11) and its receptor RANK
(also known as TRANCE-R and TNFRSF11A) are essential for the development and
activation of osteoclasts4,5. The RANKL/RANK system also controls lymph-node
organogenesis, the development of thymic medullary epithelial cells4–6, central thermoregulation7 and the formation of a lactating mammary gland during pregnancy8. The
expression of both RANKL and RANK has been observed in primary breast cancers in
humans and breast cancer cell lines9, and we and others have proposed that the RANKL/
RANK system can regulate bone metastases of epithelial tumours9,10. On the basis of the
clinical importance of RANKL inhibition being approved for potentially millions of patients
to prevent bone loss11, the genetically defined role of RANKL/RANK in mammary
epithelial proliferation in pregnancy8 and the regulation of the RANKL/RANK system by
sex hormones8,12, we speculated that RANKL/RANK might affect the development of
primary, hormone-driven mammary cancer.

Progesterone and its synthetic derivatives (progestins) are used in combined hormone
replacement therapy in postmenopausal women13. MPA is the most frequently and longest
used progestin in hormonal contraceptives14 and is commonly used for hormone
replacement therapy15. Because we8 and others12 have previously shown that progesterone
can induce RANKL in vivo, we tested whether MPA can also induce RANKL expression.
Treatment with MPA resulted in a more than 2,000-fold induction of messenger RNA
encoding RANKL in isolated mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 1a). Expression of mRNA
encoding RANK, osteoprogesterin16, PTHrP (parathyroid-hormone-related protein) and
TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)16 were not changed.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed the induction of RANKL protein in the mammary gland
(Fig. 1b). Western blotting showed induction of the 19-kDa soluble form of RANKL
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), most probably resulting from alternative splicing (Supplementary
Fig. 1b–d) as well as induction of matrix metalloproteinase 14 and ADAM17 (a disintegrin
and metalloproteinase 17, also called TACE (tumour-necrosis-factor-α-converting enzyme)
(Supplementary Fig. 1e), two proteases known to shed RANKL16. In addition, MPA might
induce mammary-gland prolactin receptor, which then triggers RANKL by means of Jak-2/
STAT5 signalling17. Whereas MPA triggers the substantial production of RANKL protein in
female control mice, we failed to detect RANKL induction in prolactin receptor mutants
(Supplementary Fig. 1f). Thus, MPA, through progesterone receptors, triggers massive
RANKL expression in the mammary gland.
To examine the potential role of RANKL/RANK in MPA-mediated tumorigenesis we
generated K5-Cre rankflox/Δ mice and murine-mammary-tumour virus (MMTV)-Cre
rankflox/Δ mice to delete RANK from mammary epithelial cells7. Both mouse lines seemed
healthy. As expected from our previous studies on whole-body RANKL and RANK
mutants4,8, K5-Cre rankflox/Δ mice showed normal development of mammary glands in
puberty; however, these mice did not develop milk-secreting structures during pregnancy
(Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). In MMTV-Cre rankflox/Δ mice, the formation of milk-secreting
lobulo-alveolar structures in pregnancy seemed normal (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). To
exclude any issue of development effects in K5-Cre rankflox/Δ mice we therefore used

MMTV-Cre rankflox/Δ mice. These MMTV-Cre rankflox/Δ mutant mice are hereafter termed
RANKΔmam.

Treatment with MPA triggers a massive proliferation of mammary epithelial cells18. MPAinduced proliferation of mammary epithelial cells was significantly decreased in
RANKΔmam females (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Accordingly, intraperitoneal
RANKL injections into nulliparous females triggered the proliferation of mammarygland
epithelial cells through RANK (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e). Endogenous progesterone can
affect the numbers of Lin-CD24+CD49fhi stem cells during pregnancy19 and the oestrous
cycle20. In these studies the RANKL/RANK system was implicated; however, it is not
known whether this is a direct effect. Treatment with MPA resulted in a twofold expansion
of Lin-CD24+CD49fhi cells. This expansion did not occur in MPA-treated RANKΔmam
females (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 4f). These data provide genetic proof that the
RANKL/RANK system controls the expansion of Lin-CD24+CD49fhi cells.

In the Women’s Health Initiative and the Million Women Study, the use of progestins has
been linked epidemiologically to the onset and incidence of breast cancer2,3. Because
RANKL is induced by MPA in vivo, we speculated that RANKL/RANK might affect sexhormonedriven mammary cancer. Progestin-driven mammary cancer can be modelled in
female mice18, in which the implantation of slow-release MPA pellets in the presence of the
DNA-damaging agent 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) triggers mammary cancer
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). In control females, treatment with MPA and DMBA
induced a rapid onset of palpable mammary tumours. In RANKΔmam females we observed a
marked delay in the onset of mammary cancer induced by MPA and DMBA (Fig. 2b and
Supplementary Fig. 5c, d) and markedly enhanced survival (Supplementary Fig. 5e).
Southern blotting of the tumours that developed in RANKΔmam females confirmed the
efficient deletion of RANK (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 5c). All
tumours that developed in control and RANKΔmam females showed a histopathology typical
of E-cadherin+ ductal adenocarcinomas of the cytokeratin5+ (CK5+) and CK14+ basal cell
subtype (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Ductal adenocarcinomas arising in
RANKΔmam females frequently developed extensive areas of squamous metaplasia (Fig. 2c
and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). In line with these histopathological changes, gene-expression
profiling of mammary carcinomas from control and RANKΔmam females showed distinctive
differences in their molecular signatures as assessed by gene clustering (Supplementary
Information and Supplementary Fig. 7a–c).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One week after the last DMBA treatment, all RANK-expressing control females already
showed multiple in situ carcinomas and even invasive mammary tumours. By contrast, at
this time point we observed very few carcinomas in situ and never any invasive mammary
carcinomas in RANKΔmam animals (Fig. 2d). Three weeks after the last DMBA challenge,
the incidence of carcinomas in situ was similar in control and RANKΔmam females, but
invasive carcinomas were still infrequent in the RANKΔmam mice (Fig. 2e). Proliferation
was typically decreased in tumours from RANKΔmam females (Fig. 2d, e). Deletion of
RANK in multiple other tissues including the liver, heart, muscle and the haematopoietic
compartment, but not in mammary epithelial cells, using Mx-Cre rankflox/flox mice did not
delay the onset of mammary cancer induced by MPA and DMBA (Supplementary Fig. 8a–
c), suggesting that the effects of RANK deletion are restricted to mammary epithelial cells.
In MMTV-NeuT transgenic mice, mammary-gland-specific deletion of RANK did not alter
the incidence of mammary cancer (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e) or the histopathology of
adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). In NeuT tumours we observed very low levels
of RANKL (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e). However, we cannot exclude effects of the RANKL/
RANK system on some aspects of NeuT-driven tumorigenesis, for example metastatic

behaviour. Thus, genetic inactivation of RANK in mammary epithelial cells results in a
markedly delayed onset and decreased incidence of progestin-driven mammary cancer.

Previously, we8 and others21 have shown that the RANKL/RANK system signals through
IκBkinase-α (IKK-α)–NF-κB–cyclin D1 in mammary epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.
10a). Stimulation with RANKL did indeed result in p65 NF-κB and IκB-α phosphorylation
in mouse primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) (Fig. 3a). In addition, stimulation of
MECs with RANKL triggered phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPKs) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Supplementary Fig. 10b). A
three-day in vivo treatment with MPA resulted in the accumulation of phosphorylated IkB-α
in the nucleus, indicative of an active NF-κB pathway22, and the induction of cyclin D1
protein expression in mammary epithelial cells, both of which were severely decreased in
RANKΔmam females (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). Moreover, in MPA/DMBA-induced
mammary adenocarcinomas from control and RANKΔmam females we found impaired
activation of the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 3b) and downregulated mRNA expression of cyclin
D1 (Fig. 3c). In these primary tumours we also observed upregulation of p21 mRNA (Fig.
3c), a gene that is transcriptionally suppressed by the Id2 pathway23. The Id2 pathway is a
second genetically confirmed downstream pathway for RANKL/RANK in mammary
epithelial cells23. To extend these findings to humans we assayed SKBR3 breast tumour
cells. Stimulation with RANKL induced NF-κB, p38 MAPKs and ERK activation and
proliferation in SKBR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). We next assessed the ability of
these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner, which correlates well with
tumorigenicity in vivo24. In a similar manner to stimulation with epidermal growth factor
receptor, we observed that RANKL induced the growth of SKBR3 cells in soft agar (Fig.
3d); that is, RANK signalling not only triggers proliferation but also acts as a transforming
agent to induce anchorage-independent growth.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In osteoclasts, besides the NF-κB pathway, the calcineurin-NFATc1 signalling pathway is
essential for RANKL/RANK-mediated osteoclastogenesis16. NFATc1 can also be regulated
by the Id2 pathway during RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis25. We therefore generated
MMTV-Cre nfatc1flox/Δ (NFATc1Δmam) and MMTV-Cre Ikkαflox/flox (IKK-αΔmam) mice to
delete NFATc1 and IKK-α in mammary epithelial cells. Both mutant mouse strains appear
healthy. When challenged with MPA and DMBA, IKK-αΔmam mice showed a delayed onset
of mammary cancer (Fig. 3e). In tumours from IKK-αΔmam mice we found normal
expression of IKK-β and IKK-γ but decreased NF-κB activation as determined by increased
IκB protein levels and decreased p65 NF-κB phosphorylation (Fig. 3b) and downregulated
mRNA expression of the NF-κB target gene encoding cyclin D1 (Fig. 3c). As expected, the
Id2 pathway gene p21 was not affected in tumours from IKK-αΔmam mice (Fig. 3c). We did
not observe any significant differences in tumour onset between control and NFATc1Δmam
mice (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that downstream signalling requirements are
different in osteoclast progenitors and mammary-gland epithelial cells. Thus, deletion of
IKK-α, but not NFATc1, in mammary-gland epithelial cells affects the onset of progestindriven mammary cancer.
Although treatment with MPA induces very rapid and massive proliferation of mammary
epithelial cells, MPA alone is not sufficient to trigger mammary cancer, which requires a
carcinogen to induce DNA mutations18. To analyse the role of RANKL in the cellular
response to DNA damage, we treated MECs and the RANKL-responsive human breast
cancer cell line SKBR3 with the DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin or γ-irradiation.
Treatment with RANKL did not alter the induction of γ-H2AX and p53 or the activation of
Chk1, prototypic markers of a functional DNA-damage response (Supplementary Fig. 13a).
Moreover, RANKL did not alter the early cell-cycle arrest after DNA damage with γirradiation (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c) or doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. 14a, b).

However, treatment with RANKL resulted in marked protection from cell death in response
to γ-irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c) and doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. 14a, b).
Mechanistically, γ-irradiation-induced upregulation of the pro-apoptotic molecules Bim,
Puma and Noxa did not occur in the presence of RANKL (Supplementary Fig. 14c). We
next assessed the effects of the MPA–RANKL/RANK axis on γ-irradiation-induced
apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells26. Treatment with MPA did indeed give protection
from γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells in vivo. Loss of RANK
expression on mammary epithelial cells abrogated the protective effects of MPA on γirradiation-induced cell death (Fig. 4a, b). Moreover, the IKK-α pathway is involved in
MPA-induced protection of the mammary epithelium after γ-irradiation (Supplementary Fig.
15a, b). Thus, in addition to promoting cell-cycle progression, MPA can protect from cell
death after DNA damage, by means of RANKL/RANK and IKK-α signalling.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recently it has been shown in humans and mice that mammary tumours might arise from
stem-cell populations27. We therefore tested whether a loss of RANK affects mammary
cancer stem cells; that is, tumour-initiating cells (TICs). TICs can be functionally assayed by
their ability to form non-adherent mammospheres27,28. Freshly isolated cancer cells from
control and RANKΔmam females were able to form primary mammospheres; however, after
dispersion into single cells the ability to form secondary mammospheres was significantly
impaired when TICs from RANKΔmam mice were used (Fig. 4c, d). These data indicate that
a loss of RANK expression markedly impairs the self-renewal capacity of putative cancer
stem cells.
On the basis of our results we propose the following molecular model to explain how
progestins such as MPA drive mammary cancer: MPA triggers an enormous induction of
RANKL in the mammary gland. RANKL, through RANK on mammary epithelial cells,
drives these cells into the cell cycle and protects mouse and human mammary-gland
epithelial cells from apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Moreover, the RANKL/RANK
system controls self-renewal of TICs (defined by mammosphere assays) and anchorageindependent growth in vitro. Thus, the progestin-induced RANKL/RANK system provides a
growth and survival advantage to damaged mammary epithelium, a prerequisite to the
initiation of mammary cancer29. These effects seem to be mediated, at least in part, by IKKα–NF-κB signalling.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These data have some intriguing implications. For instance, progestins have been associated
with an increased risk of having an abnormal mammogram30. Because mammograms detect
microcalcifications and glandular density30, and RANKL/RANK are crucial in bone
metabolism4,5, one could speculate that the RANKL/RANK system contributes to the
calcification of such lesions and/or glandular densities. Millions of women take
progesterone derivatives in contraceptives and for hormone replacement therapy. Because
our results show that the RANKL/RANK system is an important molecular link between
progestins and epithelial carcinogenesis, RANKL inhibition should be considered as a novel
approach to the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer.

METHODS SUMMARY

Mice carrying the rankflox allele, and MMTV-Cre, MMTV-NeuT, Mx-Cre, K5-Cre, IKKαflox
and NFATc1flox mice have been described previously (see Methods). In all experiments,
only littermate mice from the same breedings were used. Mice were bred and maintained in
accordance with institutional guidelines.

MPA and DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Treatment with MPA and DMBA was performed as described18,28. Six-week-old female
mice were anaesthetized with ketamine–xylazine and subcutaneously implanted withslowrelease MPA pellets (50 mg, 90-day release). DMBA (200 μl; 5 mg ml−1) was administered
by oral gavage six times throughout the following eight weeks as outlined in Fig. 2a. Onset
of mammary tumours was determined by palpation. We did not observe differences in
tumour onset in Cre-negative control females and littermates expressing the MMTV-Cre
transgene, indicating that Cre expression does not itself alter tumour incidence in the MPA
and DMBA mammary tumour model.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of primary mammary epithelial cells
Purified mammary epithelial cells were stained with the following antibodies: biotinconjugated anti-CD31 (catalogue no. 553371; BD), which labels endothelial cells, and
biotinylated CD45+ and Ter119+ (StemSep murine chimaera cocktail, catalogue no.
13058C; Stem Cell Technologies) both of which label haematopoietic cells. Haematopoietic
and endothelial cells were excluded by FACS with streptavidin-conjugated allophycocyanin
(catalogue no. 554067; BD). Staining with anti-CD49f (catalogue no. 551129; BD) and
CD24 (catalogue no. 553261; BD) was used to identify the mammary-stem-cell-enriched
population37,38.

Mammosphere assays
Similar-sized tumours (1 cm3 volume) were digested in complete EpiCult medium with 2.5
× collagenase/hyaluronidase. Cells (2 × 105) were then cultured in serum-free EpiCult
medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng ml−1 epidermal growth factor (Protech)
and 20 ng ml−1 basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma), using ultra-low-attachment plates.
Primary mammospheres were collected on day 7, digested into single-cell suspensions with
trypsin, and assayed for their ability to form secondary mammospheres28,39.

METHODS
Mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

rankflox mice have recently been generated in our laboratory7. MMTV-Cre31, MMTVNeuT32, Mx-Cre33, K5-Cre34, IKKαflox (ref. 35) and NFATc1flox (ref. 36) mice have been
described previously In brief, to generate mice carrying a null allele of rank (rankΔ allele),
rankflox mice were crossed to β-actin-Cre ubiquitous deleter mice. Mice carrying the rankflox
or rankΔ alleles and also the MMTV-Cre mice were backcrossed seven times onto a BALBc
background before generating the MMTV-Cre rankΔ/flox mice. MMTV-NeuT mice were
provided by G. Forni. MMTV-Cre (stock no. 003553) and Mx-Cre mice (stock no. 003556)
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Mouse genotypes were determined by PCR and
Southern blot analysis. In all experiments described in this paper, only littermate mice from
the same breedings were used. All mice were bred and maintained in accordance with
institutional guidelines.
Mammary carcinogenesis induced with MPA and DMBA
Treatment with MPA and DMBA was performed as described18,28. In brief, six-week-old
female mice were anaesthetized with ketamine–xylazine and surgically implanted with
slow-release MPA pellets (50 mg, 90-day release; Innovative Research of America)
subcutaneously on the right flank. DMBA (200 μl; 5 mg ml−1 diluted in cottonseed oil) was
administered by oral gavage six times throughout the following eight weeks as outlined in
Fig. 2a. Onset of mammary tumours was determined by palpation. We did not observe
differences in tumour onset in Cre-negative control females and littermates expressing the

Mammary tissue transplants
For transplantation studies, mammary epithelial tissue was isolated from nulliparous threeweek-old donors and implanted into cleared mammary fat pads (devoid of endogenous
epithelium) of three-week-old host nu/nu mice as described40. Cleared fat-pad
transplantation is a standard technique in mammary-gland biology to assess the cellautonomous effect of genetic ablation studies40. The mammary anlage is laid down close to
the nipple and will only start to grow through the mammary fat pad during puberty, giving
rise to the mammary epithelial tree. This epithelial anlage can be removed (‘cleared’) by
surgery in three-week-old mice, leaving the bulk of the fat pad free of epithelium.
Transplantation of primary mammary epithelial cells from a donor mouse results in the
outgrowth of these cells into a functional mammary epithelial tree with luminal and
myoepithelial cells that can generate milk-secreting alveoli on pregnancy. In our
experiments, three weeks after surgery, host females were mated and, in all cases, mammary
tissue was isolated for analysis on day 1 of lactation.
Histology, whole-mount staining and immunohistochemistry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For histological analysis, 5-μm sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
Whole-mount staining of mammary glands was performed as described8.For immunoperoxidase staining, paraffin-embedded sections were dehydrated and antigenic epitopes
were exposed by using a 10 mM citrate buffer and microwaving. Sections were incubated
with antibodies against cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 14, E-cadherin, anti-Ki67 (Novocastra)
and anti-active caspase-3 (Cell Signaling) and revealed with peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Histomorphometric indices (proliferation and apoptosis) were
calculated as the number of positive epithelial cells divided by the total number of epithelial
cells, with no fewer than 1,000 nuclei for Ki67 stainings and no fewer than 5,000 cells for
active caspase-3 staining counted per section.
Western blotting

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The human epithelial breast tumour cell line SKBR3 and primary non-transformed mouse
mammary epithelial cells were left untreated or stimulated with recombinant murine
RANKL41. Adenocarcinomas were isolated from control and mutant mice and total protein
lysates were prepared. Western blotting was performed with standard protocols. In brief,
blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% BSA in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C
(diluted in TBST in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol). Primary antibodies

in TBST for 30 min, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:2,000 dilution; Promega) for 1 h at 20–25 °C, washed three times in TBST for 30 min,
and revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence.

DNA damage responses
For measurement of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, primary mouse mammary epithelial
cells and SKBR3 human breast cancer cells were seeded at a cell density of 105 cells per
well in a six-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were then treated with
doxorubicin (1 μM) or γ-irradiation (2 Gy) in the absence or presence of recombinant
RANKL (1 μ gml−1). Cell-cycle arrest and numbers of dead cells were determined by
staining with propidium iodide. To determine in vivo mammary-gland epithelial cell death,
control and RANKΔmam littermate females were γ-irradiated with a total dose of 5 Gy. Six
hours later, mammary glands were isolated and immunostained for active caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling), indicative of apoptosis.

dissociation was used to generate single-cell suspensions: lymph nodes were removed from
both inguinal mammary fat pads; fat pads were then digested for 2.5 h in 2 ml of complete
EpiCult medium (EpiCult-B basal medium; catalogue no. 05610; StemCell Technologies)
supplemented with EpiCult-B proliferation supplements, 10 ng ml−1 basic fibroblast growth
factor (catalogue no. 02634; StemCell Technologies), 10 ng ml−1 epidermal growth factor
(catalogue no. 02633; StemCell Technologies), 4 μ gml−1 heparin (catalogue no. 07980;
StemCell Technologies), 2.5 ml of FBS (5%) and antibiotics) with 2.5×collagenase/
hyaluronidase (for example, 500 μl of 10×collagenase plus 1.5 ml of Epicult per mouse)
(catalogue no. 07912; StemCell Technologies) in 50-ml Falcon tubes at 37 °C. After
vigorous vortex-mixing, pellets were washed with 10 ml of HF medium (Hanks Balanced
Salt Solution Modified (catalogue no. 07913; StemCell Technologies) plus 2% FBS). Pellets
were then resuspended in 2 ml of prewarmed trypsin-EDTA. After a further wash with 10
ml of HF medium, pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) dispase
(catalogue no. 07913; StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 200 μl of 1 mg ml−1
DNase I (catalogue no. 07900; StemCell Technologies). After a final wash in HF, cells were
counted and prepared for FACS staining. Cells (106) were incubated with the following

antibodies: biotin-conjugated anti-CD31 (catalogue no. 553371; BD), which labels
endothelial cells, and biotinylated CD45+ and Ter119+ (StemSep murine chimaera cocktail;
catalogue no. 13058C; Stem Cell Technologies; 3.5 μl per 100 μl), which labels
haematopoietic cells, for 10 min at room temperature. Haematopoietic and endothelial cells
were excluded by FACS with streptavidin-conjugated allophycocyanin (catalogue no.
554067; BD). Staining with anti-CD49f (catalogue no. 551129; BD) and CD24 (catalogue
no. 553261; BD) was used to identify the mammary-stem-cell population as described
previously37,38.
Cancer stem-cell assays
Self-renewal of mammary cancer stem cells (TICs) was assayed with a mammosphere assay
as described previously28,39. In brief, similar-sized tumours (1 cm3 volume) were minced
and digested in complete EpiCult medium with 2.5×collagenase/hyaluronidase (catalogue
no. 07912; Stem Cell Technologies). Cells (2×105) were then cultured in serum-free EpiCult
medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng ml−1 epidermal growth factor (Protech)
and 20 ng ml−1 basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma), using six-well ultra-low-attachment
plates (Corning Costar). The primary mammospheres, which formed over 7 days, were
collected by gentle centrifugation (60g), digested into single-cell suspensions with trypsin
(0.05%, 10 min), and assayed for their ability to form secondary mammospheres as above.

Anchorage-independent growth
The ability of cells to grow in soft agar was assayed as described previously24. In brief,
DNA-grade agarose (1% in DMEM) was used as the bottom layer (2 ml in six-well plates)
and 2×104 SKBR3 cells were seeded in 1.5 ml of agarose (0.3% in DMEM). Cells were
overlaid with 1.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and cultured for 24 days.
Statistics
All values in the paper are given as means ± s.e.m. Comparisons between groups were made
with Student’s t-test. For the Kaplan–Meier analysis of tumour onset, a log-rank test was
performed. P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. In addition to the log-rank test
a post-hoc power analysis was performed (PS Power and Sample Size Calculations,
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/PowerSampleSize) to calculate the probability of correctly
rejecting the null hypothesis of equal tumour onset times given the number of experimental
animals. For the study involving the RANKΔmam animals, the null hypothesis can be
rejected with a probability (power) of 0.933 and for the IKK-αΔmam animals with a
probability of 0.766. The type I error probability associated with this test of this null
hypothesis is 0.05.
