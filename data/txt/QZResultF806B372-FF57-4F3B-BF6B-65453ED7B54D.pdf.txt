ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have high oxidative phosphorylation and
mitochondrial mass and low respiratory chain spare reserve capacity. We reasoned
that targeting the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), which indirectly controls
oxidative phosphorylation, represents a therapeutic strategy for AML. POLRMTknockdown OCI-AML2 cells exhibited decreased mitochondrial gene expression,
decreased levels of assembled complex I, decreased levels of mitochondriallyencoded Cox-II and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. POLRMT-knockdown
cells exhibited an increase in complex II of the electron transport chain, a complex
comprised entirely of subunits encoded by nuclear genes, and POLRMT-knockdown
cells were resistant to a complex II inhibitor theonyltrifluoroacetone. POLRMTknockdown cells showed a prominent increase in cell death. Treatment of OCI-AML2
cells with 10-50 µM 2-C-methyladenosine (2-CM), a chain terminator of mitochondrial
transcription, reduced mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation,
and increased cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of normal
human hematopoietic cells with 2-CM at concentrations of up to 100 µM did not
alter clonogenic growth, suggesting a therapeutic window. In an OCI-AML2 xenograft
model, treatment with 2-CM (70 mg/kg, i.p., daily) decreased the volume and mass of
tumours to half that of vehicle controls. 2-CM did not cause toxicity to major organs.
Overall, our results in a preclinical model contribute to the functional validation of
the utility of targeting the mitochondrial RNA polymerase as a therapeutic strategy
for AML.

INTRODUCTION

of the electron transport chain [5]. Mitochondrial RNA
is relatively abundant, accounting for 5% of the total
messenger RNA in most cell types [6], and is transcribed
from the mitochondrial genome by the mitochondrial
RNA polymerase (POLRMT). POLRMT is a singlesubunit RNA polymerase structurally related to the RNA
polymerase of bacteriophage and structurally unrelated to
other mammalian RNA polymerases [7].

A critical feature of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
is that it exhibits high oxidative phosphorylation, elevated
mitochondrial mass, and reduced spare reserve capacity of
the mitochondrial respiratory chain [1-4]. Mitochondrial
transcription indirectly controls oxidative phosphorylation
since the mitochondrial genome encodes crucial subunits

RESULTS

POLRMT is overexpressed in most haematologic
malignancies [8], and overexpressing the mitochondrial
RNA polymerase increased tumour growth in a xenograft
model of breast cancer [9], suggesting that POLRMT
contributes functionally to tumour growth. A number of
nucleoside analogues used as antiviral agents to target
viral RNA polymerases demonstrate off-target inhibition
of POLRMT [10]. One of these, 2-C-methyladenosine
(2-CM), was employed in the current study as a small
molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription. The
inhibition of mitochondrial translation as a therapeutic
strategy for leukemia has shown preclinical efficacy [1]
and has progressed to Phase I clinical trials (Clinicaltrials.
gov identifier NCT01332786). In the current work, we
asked whether inhibiting POLRMT either with shRNA or
with 2-CM would also have potential anticancer properties
in AML cells.

POLRMT knockdown decreases POLRMT
protein levels
shRNA delivery of sequences directed against
POLRMT was achieved using lentiviral infection in OCIAML2 cells. Western blotting revealed that the levels
of the 135 kD POLRMT protein were reduced in cells
infected with four different shRNAs targeting POLRMT
(Figure 1A). In order to better control the kinetics of
the shRNA-mediated knockdown, the same shRNA
sequences were cloned into a single-plasmid doxycyclineinducible system [14]. Doxycycline decreased the levels
of POLRMT protein in the doxycycline-inducible system
(Figure 1B). The POLRMT gene also has been reported
to express an alternative transcript [13] encoding single

polypeptide RNA polymerase IV (spRNAP-IV). shRNA
against spRNAP-IV reduced the levels of spRNAP-IV
transcript (Figure 1C). However, spRNAP-IV protein was
not detectable by Western blotting or immunofluorescence
(Figure S1), consistent with a recent report indicating that
spRNAP-IV protein is not detectable in human cells [15].

the 13 protein-encoding mitochondrial genes, we chose
to assess the four mitochondrial genes ND6, ND3, CO2
and ATP8 since this set includes a transcript from the
light strand promoter (ND6) and from the heavy strand
promoter 2, from which the remaining 12 mRNAs are
produced. We chose to include mtDNA-encoded subunits
of complex I (ND6, ND3), complex IV (CO2) and
complex V (ATP8). As a positive control for decreased
mitochondrial gene expression, we treated OCI-AML2
cells with ethidium bromide (0.04 µg/mL) for 3 hours, a
relatively low concentration that inhibits the expression
of mitochondrial genes ND1 and CO2 by at least 50%
[16]. Expression of all four mitochondrial genes was

significantly reduced by ethidium bromide (Figure S2).
In OCI-AML2 cells, POLRMT knockdown had no effect
on the expression of 18S ribosomal RNA, and data were
normalized to 18S. POLRMT knockdown resulted in
the decreased expression of all four mitochondrial genes
relative to shGFP controls (Figure 2A).

increased the level of a nuclear DNA-encoded complex
II subunit (succinate dehydrogenase B) (Figure 2C). The
functional relevance of the observed elevation in complex
II was tested by treating POLRMT-knockdown cells with
a complex II inhibitor, theonyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)
(Figure 2D). shGFP-treated cells were sensitive to 100 nM
TTFA, while shPOLRMT-treated OCI-AML2 cells were
resistant, consistent with the elevated levels of complex II
in shPOLRMT-treated cells observed by the multiplex and
Western blotting approaches.

Effect of POLRMT knockdown on electron
transport chain proteins
We simultaneously measured assembled forms
of ETC complexes I-V by employing a magnetic bead
multiplex assay that utilizes antibodies raised against
assembled ETC complexes [17]. In POLRMT-knockdown
cells, the level of assembled complex I was significantly
reduced. In contrast, the level of assembled complex II,
the only ETC complex comprised entirely of subunits
encoded by nuclear DNA, was two-fold higher than in
shGFP-infected cells (Figure 2B). Western blotting with
antibodies directed against subunits of each complex
showed that POLRMT knockdown reduced the levels of
a mtDNA-encoded complex IV subunit (mtCOX-II) and a
nuclear DNA-encoded complex I subunit (NDUFB8), and

In order to determine whether POLRMT knockdown
affects oxidative phosphorylation, we measured basal
oxygen consumption in intact cells as an index of
oxidative phosphorylation and used an extracellular flux
analyzer. In OCI-AML2 cells treated with shPOLRMT
#1, basal oxygen consumption was reduced relative to
the non-targeting control (Figure 2E). In the doxycyclineinducible system, OCI-AML2 cells infected with
doxycycline-inducible shPOLRMT #1 had a basal oxygen

consumption rate that was lower than the non-targeting
control (Figure 2F). To confirm that the decrease in
oxygen consumption rate was not unique to OCI-AML2
cells, K562 cells were also treated with shRNA against
POLRMT or a non-targeting control, and a decrease in
basal oxygen consumption rate with shPOLRMT treatment
was observed (Figure 2G), similar to OCI-AML2 cells.
Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed
with the potentiometric dye tetramethylrhodamine, methyl
ester (TMRM) and flow cytometry. Frequency histograms
revealed a TMRM-negative peak representing cells with
depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, and a
TMRM-positive peak, representing cells with a polarized
mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 2I). In OCIAML2 cells, POLRMT knockdown resulted in the loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential relative to shGFP
controls (Figure 2H).

Several ribonucleoside analogue antiviral drugs
designed to inhibit the viral RNA polymerases of the
hepatitis C virus or the dengue fever virus exhibit off-target
inhibition of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase,
presumably due to similarities in the structures of these
RNA polymerases from different species [10]. In OCIAML2 and K562 cells, 2-CM treatment (10-50 µM) did
not affect the expression of 18S ribosomal RNA, and data
were normalized to 18S. 2-CM decreased mitochondrial
gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner
in both OCI-AML2 and K562 cells (Figure 4A). 2-CM
decreased basal oxygen consumption in a concentrationdependent manner in both OCI-AML2 and K562 cells
(Figure 4B). In K562 cells with POLRMT knockdown,
basal oxygen consumption was normalized to shGFP
controls; for POLRMT knockdown cells, 2-CM had no
effect on the basal oxygen consumption rate, consistent
with POLRMT being a relevant target for 2-CM (Figure
4B). In OCI-AML2 cells, 2-CM caused a concentrationdependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
(Figure 4C) and a concentration-dependent increase in
the proportion of early apoptotic cells, as measured by
the proportion of Annexin V positive/PI negative cells
(Figure 4D). To assess the potential effects of 2-CM on
normal human hematopoietic cells, colony forming assays
were performed on normal human CD34+ hematopoietic
cells. Treatment of human CD34+ cells with 2-CM up to
concentrations of 100 µM did not alter clonogenic growth
(Figure 4E), while in a parallel clonogenic assay with
OCI-AML2 cells, clonogenic growth was impaired at
2-CM concentrations of 10 µM and greater (Figure 4E).
To assess proliferation in bulk cultures of OCI-AML2
cells, these cells were treated with 2-CM for two weeks
and a concentration-dependent reduction in cell number
was observed (Figure 4F). 2-CM concentrations as low
as 200 nM reduced the cumulative cell number. In order
to assess the efficacy of 2-CM in multiple leukemia
and lymphoma cell lines, four additional cell lines were
assessed for viability after 2-CM. The IC50 values for
2-CM in K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), U937
leukemic monocyte lymphoma, OCI-LY17 (non-Hodgkin
lymphoma) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) were in
the mid-micromolar range (Figure 4G). In order to assess
the effect of 2-CM on cell cycle, nuclear DNA content was
assessed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry.
The proportion of cells in S phase was similar between
vehicle controls (25%) and cells treated with 5 µM (24%),
10 µM (24%) or 20 µM (29%) 2-CM for 24 hours (Figure
4H).

POLRMT knockdown reduces growth and
viability of OCI-AML2 cells
To determine the cellular consequences of inhibiting
POLRMT, we assessed the effect of POLRMT knockdown
on the growth and viability of OCI-AML2 cells (Figure
3). Proliferation curves revealed that cumulative cell
number was lower in POLRMT-knockdown cells relative
to shGFP controls (Figure 3A). Early apoptosis, assessed
by the proportion of Annexin-V positive/PI negative cells,
was measured at 6-7 days post-infection, a time prior
to or at which the differences in the proliferation curve
were beginning to become apparent. In OCI-AML2 cells
infected with four different shRNA constructs against
POLRMT, apoptosis was increased up to 3-fold relative
to shGFP controls (Figure 3B), indicating that the effects
of POLRMT knockdown were more than cytostatic.
Proliferation and apoptosis were also measured in the
doxycycline-inducible system (Figure 3C, 3D). At 10
days of doxycycline treatment, the cumulative cell number
was lower in cells where POLRMT shRNA was induced
by doxycycline (Figure 3D). At 6 days of doxycycline
treatment, the proportion of early apoptotic Annexin V
positive/PI negative cells was elevated two-fold in cells
infected with inducible shPOLRMT#1 (Figure 3C). In
order to assess whether POLRMT knockdown affected
cell cycle progression, nuclear DNA content was assessed
by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. The
proportion of cells in S phase was similar between shGFP
controls (11%) and shPOLRMT-treated cells (16%) at 6
days post-infection (Figure 3E).

DISCUSSION

chain, where they then act as chain terminators [10]. In the
current study with leukemia cells, the shRNA knockdown
of POLRMT or the treatment with 2-CM had similar
effects on mitochondrial gene expression, oxidative
phosphorylation, apoptosis and cell proliferation,
consistent with previous reports that 2-CM inhibits
mitochondrial transcription in human cells [10]. We
consider 2-CM to be a tool molecule rather a candidate
for therapeutic application. One limitation of 2-CM is
that it can also inhibits elongation by RNA polymerase
II [10]. However, the proofreading ability of TFIIS
excises 2-CM from transcripts of RNA polymerase II,
and the transcriptional elongation of the RNA polymerase
II transcript GAPDH in human cells is unaltered by
concentrations of 2-CM up to 200 µM [10]. 2-CM does
not affect DNA polymerases alpha, beta or gamma at
concentrations up to 50 µM [22], but its potential effects
on RNA polymerases I and III are unknown.
POLRMT-knockdown cells and leukemia cells
treated with 2-CM showed a decrease in oxidative
phosphorylation. This observation is consistent with the
reliance of AML cells on oxidative phosphorylation for
growth and viability, and the high mitochondrial mass and
the low spare reserve capacity of AML cells [23] along
with the antileukemic effects of inhibiting mitochondrial
translation [1]. Leukemia stem cells are unable to respond
to decreased oxidative phosphorylation by increasing
glycolysis [4], confirming the functional importance of
the reliance on oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover,
mutations in mtDNA-encoded subunits of complex IV
have been associated with poor disease-free survival in
AML patients [24], supporting the importance of mtDNAencoded electron transport chain subunits in AML.
Results from the colony-forming assays in normal
human hematopoietic CD34+ cells suggest the existence
of a therapeutic window for 2-C-methyladenosine, where
OCI-AML2 cells show decreased clonogenic growth at
10 µM, while the clonogenic growth of CD34+ cells was
unaffected at concentrations up to 100 µM. In addition, for
CD34+ cells, the number of granulocyte-, macrophageand eosinophil-colony forming units and erythroid burstforming units was unaltered by concentrations of 2-CM
up to 100 µM, suggesting that 2-CM did not affect the
differentiation of CD34+ cells along multiple lineages.
2-CM is not toxic to human liver cells at concentrations up
to 100 µM [22]. Results from xenograft experiments with
OCI-AML2 cells treated with 70 mg/kg 2-CM indicate
that 2-CM has antileukemic activity in vivo, as measured
by reduced tumour volume and tumour mass. These
antileukemic effects occurred in the absence of organ
toxicity, as measured by serum enzymes and histology of
major organs.
In conclusion, these results contribute to the
functional validation in cell culture and in vivo of the
utility of targeting the mitochondrial RNA polymerase as
a therapeutic strategy for AML. The strategy of targeting

The main conclusions drawn from the results of the
current study are that POLRMT knockdown or treatment
with 2-C-methyladenosine, an inhibitor of mitochondrial
transcription, triggers the death of AML cells. Moreover,
2-C-methyladenosine showed antileukemic activity in vivo
in the absence of organ toxicity.
For POLRMT, it has been reported that a minor
splice variant, spRNAP-IV results in an N-terminal
truncated protein [13, 18]. Recent studies have been
unable to replicate the involvement of spRNAP-IV in the
transcription of nuclear genes [15]. We were similarly
unable to detect spRNAP-IV protein, and shRNA directed
against the spRNAP-IV transcript did not affect cell
proliferation (data not shown). We conclude that the
functionally relevant product of the POLRMT gene in
OCI-AML2 cells is POLRMT, the mitochondrial RNA
polymerase.
POLRMT knockdown or 2-CM treatment decreased
mitochondrial gene expression. Since mitochondrial
transcription occurs in a continuous polycistronic fashion,
transcription of the genes furthest from the transcriptional
start site (such as the cytochrome b gene on the mtDNA
heavy chain) are predicted to be most affected by the chain
terminating action of 2-CM.
In POLRMT knockdown cells, we observed that
the mitochondrially-encoded COX-II protein, a subunit
of complex IV, was decreased. In POLRMT knockdown
cells, the level of assembled complex I was reduced, likely
as a result of the high proportion of mtDNA-encoded
subunits in complex I [5]. The level of a nuclear-encoded
subunit of complex I was also decreased in POLRMTknockdown cells, as has been observed in cells lacking
TFAM, a major transcription factor for POLRMT [19]. We
also noted that complex II, an ETC complex composed
entirely of nuclear DNA-encoded subunits, was elevated
in POLRMT knockdown cells. A similar finding of
elevated complex II accompanied by decreases in complex
I and sometimes decreases in complexes III-V have been
observed in cells in which TFAM has been deleted [19,
20]. The mechanism of complex II elevation is unknown
but may relate to an alternative entry point of electrons
into ETC via complex II.
We observed that POLRMT knockdown or 2-CM
treatment increased cell death without affecting cell cycle.
Our results are consistent with a genome-wide RNAi study
indicating that in HeLa cells, POLRMT RNAi does not
alter cell division but does decrease viability [21].
Several ribonucleoside analogues designed to
inhibit viral RNA polymerases such as those of the
hepatitis C and Dengue fever viruses inhibit mitochondrial
transcription [10]. Some of these ribonucleoside analogues
can be triphosphorylated intracellularly. Several of these

in the pLKO.1 vector was employed (Sigma-Aldrich
Oakville, Ontario, Canada). In order to generate additional
shRNA against POLRMT and spRNAP-IV, the pLKO.1
plasmid [12] was obtained (Addgene plasmid 10878
Addgene, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., originally
generated by Dr. David Root). The plasmid was cut with
AgeI and EcoR1 and the relevant hairpin oligonucleotides
were inserted. The oligonucleotides were designed against
the published targeting sequences [13] for spRNAPIV (target region is GGCAAAGAAGGTAACACAA)
and for the exon 3 of POLRMT (target region
is
CAAAGATACTGGAGAAGGATA),
termed
shPOLRMT#4. Cloning was confirmed by DNA
sequencing.
To generate lentivirus, the pLKO.1 plasmids were
mixed with plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 (Addgene
plasmids 12259 and 12260, originally generated by Dr.
Didier Trono) and TransIT LT-1 transfection reagent
(Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A.) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The plasmid mixture
was added to Lenti-X 293T packaging cells (Clontech
Laboratories, Inc., Moutain View, California, U.S.A.)
and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. Media was then
exchanged for media containing 30% fetal bovine serum,
and cells were grown for an additional 24 hours. Media
was harvested, concentrated 30-fold through 100 kD
cutoff centrifugal concentrator columns (EMD Millipore,
Billerica Massachusetts, U.S.A.) at 4,000 x g for 20
minutes and frozen at -80 degrees C. For infections, virus
was added to OCI-AML2 cells in media containing 5 µg/
37224

Oncotarget

mL protamine for 24 hours, then media was removed and
replaced with media containing 2.5 µg/mL puromycin for
72 hours of selection.
For the doxycycline-inducible shRNA system, a
single lentiviral vector [14] plasmid system was employed.
Using Gateway cloning, shRNA oligonucleotides
were generated by PCR and cloned into the Entry
vector pDONR221 using the BP clonase reaction,
and transformed into One Shot® OmniMAX ™ 2 T1
Phage-Resistant Cells E. coli and selected with 100
ug/mL ampicillin. For the cloned shRNAs, the prefix
“i” was added to indicate inducible. Target sequences
designed against regions common to both isoforms of
POLRMT were (3114, CGGTGGATGTACCCATGCTTT
(targets 1984 of coding sequence) i shPOLRMT #1;
GACTCCAAGGTCAAGCAAATA (targets 3309 of
coding sequence) ish POLRMT #2 ;
CAACACACGTAAGCAGAAGAA (targets 3386
of coding sequence) ish POLRMT #4; sequence designed
against spRNAP-IV: GGCAAAGAAGGTAACACAA
(ish spRNAP-IV), or sequence designed against the
exon 3 of POLRMT: CAAAGATACTGGAGAAGGATA
(targets 424 of coding sequence). A negative control nontargeting shRNA (using Non-Target shRNA #1, Sigma)
was also cloned in parallel. Cloning was confirmed by
sequencing. Gateway cloning was used (LR clonase
reaction) to transfer the shRNA into the desination vector
pLV719G; transformants were selected with kanamycin.
pLV719G-ShRNA plasmids were mixed with plasmids
pMD2.G and psPAX2 (Addgene plasmids 12259 and
12260) and TransIT LT-1 transfection reagent and added
to 293EMT. Viral supernatant was concentrated as
above. For infections, virus was added to OCI-AML2
cells in media containing 5 µg/mL protamine for 24
hours, then media was removed and replaced with media
containing tetracycline-free FBS (Clontech Laboratories,
Inc., Moutain View, California, U.S.A.) and 2.5 µg/mL
puromycin for 72 hours. To induce the expression of
shRNA, infected OCI-AML2 cells were grown in media
containing 1 µg/mL doxycycline.
For the overexpression of spRNAP-IV, the vector
pLX304 (Addgene plasmid 25890) was employed, and
Gateway cloning was used to insert a truncated version of
POLRMT (starting with the ATG corresponding to a N262
truncation mutant), using as a template I.M.A.G.E. clone
6572256 that contains the POLRMT cDNA.
Lentivirus was produced as above, and HeLa or OCIAML2 cells were infected and selected with blasticidin.

priming and Superscript III (Life Technologies.) TaqMan
analysis of genes ND3, ND6, CO2, ATP8 and 18S was
performed using primers and probes (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.) and Taqman Gene expression master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) and an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time
PCR instrument. Standard curves with variable amounts
of cDNA input were conducted to confirm linearity of
response. Experiments were performed in triplicate and
relative expression was determined using the delta delta Ct
method. Mitochondrial gene expression was normalized to
18S expression, and data were expressed relative to shGFP
controls. RNA content was determined using A260/280 on
a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
For spRNAP-IV expression, primers p2
(Intron 1 forward) GTGGTTTCTTATGCAGCCTC
gtggtttcttatgcagcctc and p3 (exon 3 reverse)
ATCCTTCTCCAGTATCTTTGC
were
employed.
KiCqStart Master Mix (Sigma) was utilized, with
amplification in a BioRad CFX96 Real-time PCR
machine, and expression was normalized to 18S.

Measurement of assembled electron transport
chain complexes
The level of assembled electron transport chain
complexes was determined using a Human Oxidative
Phosphorylation Magnetic Bead Panel Milliplex MAP
Kit, according to the manufacturer’s (EMD Millipore)
instructions. 10 µg of protein lysate from OCI-AML2
cells infected with shGFP or shPOLRMT#1 for 6 days
was run in triplicate on a Luminex 200 instrument
(EMD Millipore). The levels of nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase were also measured to confirm equal
loading of samples.

Western blotting
2 X 106 OCI-AML2 cells were pelleted and frozen
at -80 degrees. For the detection of POLRMT, cells were
lysed in RIPA lysis buffer and proteins were separated
on a 7.5% PAGE minigel (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For
mitochondrial proteins, cells were lysed in 1.5% n-betamaltoside (Sigma) dissolved in PBS. Lysates were
supplemented with Halt protease inhibitors (Thermo
Scientific) and 0.5 mM EDTA. For mitochondrial proteins,
separation was performed on a 12% PAGE gel. Semi-dry
transfer was performed (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad) onto
PVDF membranes. Primary antibodies and concentrations
were: POLRMT, Abcam ab32988, 1:250; OXPHOS
cocktail, Abcam ab110411, 1:1,000 (contains antibodies
against complex I, NDUFB8, complex II, SDHB, complex
III, UQCRC2, complex IV, COXII, complex V, ATP5A),
and alpha-tubulin, 1:1000.

Gene expression assays
Total RNA was isolated from infected OCI-AML2
cells using the RNEasy plus kit (Qiagen) or an Aurum
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) Cells were assessed at 4
or 6 days post-infection for the shRNA studies, or at 24
hours after 2-CM. cDNA was synthesized using random

Flow cytometry

Xenograft model

OCI-AML2 cells were treated with shRNA for 7
days, or 2-CM for 3 days. For TMRM studies, OCI-AML2
cells were incubated with IMDM containing 400 nM
Tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM) (Invitrogen,
Burlington, ON, Canada) for 20 minutes. Cells were
pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed on a flow
cytometer. For Annexin staining, OCI-AML2 cells were
pelleted, washed in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 150
µL binding buffer containing 5 µL of Annexin-V-FITC
and 50 µg/mL propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen). Flow
cytometry analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur
or a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
Mississauga, ON, Canada) and FLOJO software (Tree
Star, Ashland, OR, USA). 10,000 events were recorded per
sample, and single cells were gated using forward and side
scatter. Experiments were performed in triplicates, and
repeated twice to ensure reproducibility. For DNA content,
cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with propidium
iodide, and analysis performed as above. Cell cycle phases
were estimated using the Dean-Jett-Fox model and FloJo
software.

Twenty male SCID mice, 10-12 weeks of age,
were implanted subcutaneously with 3 X 105 OCI
AML2 cells. Eight days later, mice were randomized
into two groups: 10 mice were injected with 70 mg/kg
2-C-methyladenosine, i.p. and 10 mice were injected with
vehicle controls (DMSO with cremophor, 10%v/v in 0.9%
sodium chloride solution). Mice were injected daily, once
a day, for eleven days. Tumour volume was measured
with calipers at days 8,11,13, 15, 18 and 19 at which time
mice were euthanized. Tumours were weighed, serum was
taken, and major organs (liver, kidney, lung, muscle and
heart) were harvested. All animal studies were carried out
according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care and with the approval of the Ontario Cancer
Institute Animal Ethics Review Board.

Statistics
Data were analyzed statistically using one-way
ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or t-tests as appropriate and
P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software,
Inc.). On graphs, * indicates P < 0.05, ** indicates P <
0.01 and *** indicates P < 0.001.

Measurement of respiration by extracellular flux
analysis

Abbreviations

Cellular energy metabolism in intact cells was
determined by the measurement of metabolic profiles
over time. OCI-AML2 cells were treated with shRNA for
6 days or with 2-CM for 2 days at which time they were
resuspended in unbuffered medium, and seeded at 1.2x105
viable cells/well in XF96 plates (Seahorse Biosciences),
then incubated for for 45 min at 37oC in a CO2-free
incubator. Oxidative phosphorylation was measured by the
oxygen consumption rate (pMol/min) using the Seahorse
XF24 Extracellular Flux analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences,
Billerica, MA). Experiments were performed in triplicates,
and repeated at least twice to ensure reproducibility.
