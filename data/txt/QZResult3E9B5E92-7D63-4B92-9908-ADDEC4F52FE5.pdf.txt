Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor CCI779 (temsirolimus) is a recently Food and Drug Administration–approved anticancer drug with efficacy in certain solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies. In cell culture studies,
CCI-779 at the commonly used nanomolar concentrations
generally confers a modest and selective antiproliferative
activity. Here, we report that, at clinically relevant low micromolar concentrations, CCI-779 completely suppressed proliferation of a broad panel of tumor cells. This ‘‘high-dose’’
drug effect did not require FKBP12 and correlated with an
FKBP12-independent suppression of mTOR signaling. An
FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) binding–deficient
rapamycin analogue failed to elicit both the nanomolar and
micromolar inhibitions of growth and mTOR signaling,
implicating FRB binding in both actions. Biochemical assays
indicated that CCI-779 and rapamycin directly inhibited
mTOR kinase activity with IC50 values of 1.76 F 0.15 and
1.74 F 0.34 Mmol/L, respectively. Interestingly, a CCI-779–
resistant mTOR mutant (mTOR-SI) displayed an 11-fold
resistance to the micromolar CCI-779 in vitro (IC50, 20 F
3.4 Mmol/L) and conferred a partial protection in cells
exposed to micromolar CCI-779. Treatment of cancer cells
with micromolar but not nanomolar concentrations of CCI779 caused a marked decline in global protein synthesis
and disassembly of polyribosomes. The profound inhibition
of protein synthesis was accompanied by rapid increase in the
phosphorylation of translation elongation factor eEF2 and
the translation initiation factor eIF2A. These findings suggest
that high-dose CCI-779 inhibits mTOR signaling through an
FKBP12-independent mechanism that leads to profound
translational repression. This distinctive high-dose drug effect
could be directly related to the antitumor activities of CCI-779
and other rapalogues in human cancer patients. [Cancer Res

have shown promising antitumor activity of CCI-779 in other
tumor types, including breast cancer (1), glioma (2), endometrial
cancer (3), and mantle cell lymphoma (4). The anticancer activity
of CCI-779 likely involves multiple pharmacologic actions, including its antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties (5, 6).
The molecular mechanism of CCI-779 antitumor effect involves
inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase
function. mTOR is an evolutionary conserved serine/threonine
kinase, the founding member of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K)–related kinase family. In mammals, mTOR kinase acts
as a key metabolic sensor that coordinates cell growth and proliferation with the availability of growth factors, nutrients, and
intracellular ATP (7). Rapamycin or its analogues form tight
binary complex with the small immunophilin FKBP12 (FK506
binding protein), which is highly abundant in human cells. The
rapamycin-FKBP12 complex binds mTOR in a unique region
called FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB; ref. 8). Accumulating evidence points to the potential regulatory role for the FRB
region in ligand-mediated mTOR activity and/or mTOR signal
transduction in cells. Although the exact mechanism by which
rapamycin inhibits mTOR catalytic activity remains unclear, earlier
findings suggest that the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex acutely
destabilizes mTOR complex 1 and, in certain cell types, interferes
with the assembly of the mTOR complex 2 (9–11). Rapamycin
might also compete with phosphatidic acid for binding to FRB,
thereby interfering with activation of mTOR by phosphatidic
acid (12, 13).
In vitro, CCI-779 and rapamycin at the commonly used
nanomolar dose range effectively suppress the cellular phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1. However, the
growth inhibitory effects at these same drug concentrations are
generally modest and selective against certain tumor cell lines,
including brain, breast, prostate, rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Recent
clinical studies in patients with various solid malignancies showed
that concentrations of CCI-779 in whole blood generally reach
micromolar levels (1, 14–16). Although most of the in vitro studies
that investigate CCI-779 and/or rapamycin action in cancer cells
use nanomolar drug concentrations, they do not address the
inhibitory response and underlying cellular mechanism(s) to the
drug at the clinically relevant micromolar doses.
In this report, we have identified a distinct pharmacologic mode
of action of the rapamycin and its analogues. We show that a broad
and profound suppression of tumor cell growth can be achieved by
the clinically relevant low micromolar concentrations of CCI-779,
a phenomenon we term as the ‘‘high-dose effect.’’ This enhanced
antitumor activity is mechanistically linked to a previously unreported FKBP12-independent suppression of mTOR kinase
activity and mTOR signaling in cancer cells. We show that the
micromolar but not the nanomolar concentrations of CCI-779

uniquely affect the function of the cellular translation machinery,
leading to a marked decline in global protein synthesis, and
profound inhibition of cell growth. This high-dose drug effect could
be highly relevant to the treatment of human cancer patients with
CCI-779 and other rapamycin analogues.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. All general chemicals used for buffers and assays were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. mTOR inhibitors CCI-779, rapamycin, and the rapamycin derivative WAY-179639
were provided by Wyeth Chemical and Pharmaceutical Development.
FK506 was obtained from EMD Calbiochem. All inhibitors were dissolved
in DMSO as concentrated stocks and diluted before use in DMSO for
in vitro enzyme or binding assays or diluted in culture media for cellbased assays.
Cell culture, growth assays, and transfections. Human lung tumor
lines (A549, H157, H460, H446), colon tumor lines (HCT116, HT29, SW480,
DLD1, Caco2), prostate tumor lines (LNCap, DU145), breast lines (MDA468,
MDA231), and the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. PC3-MM2 were obtained from
Dr. C. Discafani of Wyeth Oncology. Cells were cultured in a 37jC incubator
with 5% CO2 using standard cell culture methods. All culture media,
supplements, and transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.
For growth assays, cells were plated in 96-well culture plates at 1  to
3  103 cells per well. After 24 h, cells were treated with various doses of
inhibitors. Three days after drug treatment, viable cell densities were
determined by MTS dye conversion using CellTiter AQ assay kit (Promega).
To create an mTOR-SI cell line, the empty vector pIRESneo3 (Clontech) or
pIRESneo3-mTOR-SI (S2035I, created by site-directed mutagenesis) were
transfected into HEK293 cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and
selected by G418. The effect of each treatment was calculated as percentage
of control growth relative to the vehicle DMSO-treated cells grown in the
same culture plate. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown
experiments, HCT116 cells were seeded at 30% confluence on 24-well
culture plates and transfected with 60 nmol/L siRNA using Lipofectamine
RNAiMax. siRNA transfections were repeated 48 h later, and the cells were
then incubated for additional 24 h, followed by the drug treatment. The
eEF2K siRNA pool and nontargeting siRNA pool were obtained from
Dharmacon.
Protein lysates and immunoblotting. For all experiments, cells were
plated in six-well plates in complete growth media for overnight. Various
doses of CCI-779 or rapamycin analogues were added alone or with FK506
for indicated periods of time. Total cellular lysates were prepared using
NuPAGE-LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of proteins were
subjected to immunoblotting analysis using NuPAGE electrophoresis
system (Invitrogen). Antibodies for phosphorylated S6K1 (Thr389), total
S6K1, phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Thr70 and Thr46), phosphorylated AKT
(Ser473), total AKT, phosphorylated GSK-3 (Ser9/21), phosphorylated
mTOR (Ser2481), phosphorylated eEF2 (Thr56), total eEF2, phosphorylated
eIF2a (Ser51), phosphorylated eEF2K (Ser366), and cyclin D3 were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies for total GSK-3 and activating
transcription factor 4 (ATF-4; H-290) were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The p21/Cip1 antibody was from BD Transduction
Laboratories and the h-actin antibody was from Chemicon-Millipore.
Immunoblots were probed with appropriate primary and secondary
antibodies following manufacturer’s instructions and detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). h-Actin immunoblotting
and/or reversible Ponceau-S staining of nitrocellulose membranes after the
transfer (17, 18) were used to visualize the total protein loading.
Production and binding assays of FKBP12 and FRB. The human
FKBP12 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from human placenta
Quick Clone cDNA (Clontech) and was inserted into the XhoI/HindIII sites
of the Escherichia coli vector ptrcHis (Invitrogen). The FRB domain of
human mTOR (amino acids 2015–2114) was generated by PCR from the
mTOR cDNA (19) and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the E. coli

www.aacrjournals.org

vector pGEX2T (GE Healthcare). His6-FKBP12 and glutathione S-transferase–FRB were produced and purified according to the respective vendor’s
instructions. FKBP12 binding assay was done in the 96-well format nickel
chelate flashplate with [3H]FK506 (NEN-PerkinElmer; Supplementary
Materials and Methods). FRB binding by the rapamycin analogues was
assessed in an FKBP12-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex formation assay in
the 96-well MaxiSorp Fluoro plates (Nunc; Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
In vitro assay of mTOR catalytic activity. The Flag-tagged wild-type
human mTOR (Flag-mTOR) and Flag-mTOR-SI (S2035I, created by sitedirected mutagenesis) DNA constructs were transiently transfected into
HEK293 cells. Protein extraction and purification of Flag-mTOR and FlagmTOR-SI were carried out 48 h later as described previously (19). In vitro
kinase assays of purified Flag-mTOR and Flag-mTOR-SI without or with
FKBP12 were done and detected by dissociation-enhanced lanthanide
fluorescent immunoassay (DELFIA) as described (19).
Analysis of global translation. Global protein synthesis was measured
by determining incorporation of [3H]methionine into TCA-insoluble cellular
components (Supplementary Materials and Methods). Analysis of polysome
profiles was done as described previously (20) with minor modifications
(Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Results
CCI-779 at low micromolar concentrations broadly suppresses tumor cell proliferation via an FKBP12-independent
mechanism. During our studies on tumor cell proliferation in
culture, we noted that CCI-779 displayed a biphasic dose response
in a panel of human tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A). In the commonly
used dose range of 10 nmol/L to <5 Amol/L, the drug exhibited
a generally flat and cell-selective inhibition of cell proliferation. The
most sensitive cell lines that were inhibited by z50% included
LNCap, PC3MM2, MDA468, H446, and Caco2, whereas those
with V25% inhibition were SW480, HT29, HCT116, and H460.
Interestingly, at higher dose range of 5 to 15 Amol/L, the drug
manifested a more profound antiproliferative activity in nearly
all cell lines (Fig. 1A). A similar biphasic inhibition pattern was
observed for rapamycin (data not shown). These observations
raised the possibility that at the low micromolar doses, CCI-779
may exert a previously uncharacterized inhibition mechanism.
Because rapamycin in complex with FKBP12 inhibits mTOR
with high affinity (f3 nmol/L; ref. 21), we first performed FK506
competition experiments to determine whether the second phase
inhibition (called micromolar inhibition) similarly requires
FKBP12. CCI-779 was titrated in LNCap and MDA468 cell
proliferation assay, with or without 0.3, 3, and 10 Amol/L FK506,
to completely inhibit the binding of CCI-779 to FKBP12 (Fig. 1B).
In both cell lines, antiproliferative effect of CCI-779 at concentrations of V10 Amol/L was largely reversed by FK506, indicating
that the interaction with FKBP12 was essential for low-dose
inhibition of cell growth by CCI-779. However, the high-dose
growth inhibitory effect of the drug was completely resistant to
cotreatment with 10 Amol/L FK506 in both LNCap and MDA468
cells. These data indicate that the biphasic inhibition of cell
proliferation elicited by CCI-779 reflects both FKBP12-dependent
and FKBP12-independent actions of this drug at low versus high
concentrations respectively.
The growth inhibitory action of rapamycin at nanomolar
concentrations is well known to be largely cytostatic. To determine
whether the micromolar CCI-779 also elicits cytostasis, we
measured viability of several representative cell lines after 24 and
48 h of exposure to 20 nmol/L or 20 Amol/L CCI-779. Consistent
with the previous finding, no cell death was detected in 20 nmol/L

Figure 1. CCI-779 displays biphasic inhibitions of tumor cell proliferation via both FKBP12-dependent and FKBP12-independent mechanisms. A, indicated human
lung, colon, breast, and prostate tumor cell lines were plated in 96-well culture plates. DMSO vehicle and various doses of CCI-779 were added 24 h later. Viable
cell numbers were determined 3 d post–drug treatment, as described in Materials and Methods. Cell growth data in CCI-779–treated wells are expressed as percentage
of control value obtained from vehicle-treated wells on the same culture plate. B, LNCap and MDA468 cells were assayed in growth inhibition by CCI-779 with 0,
0.3, 3, and 10 Amol/L of FK506. The assays were done and analyzed similarly as in A.

CCI-779–treated cells. In cells treated with 20 Amol/L CCI-779, cell
death for HCT116, HT29, A549, and HEK293 was minimal at both
time points. Interestingly, both PTEN-negative cell lines LNCap and
MDA468 exhibited a small but significant reduction in viability
as early as 24 h (Supplementary Table S1). To further examine
whether these cells undergo apoptosis, we performed immunoblotting for PARP cleavage as well as caspase activity assays. CCI-779
(20 Amol/L) caused PARP cleavage in LNCap and MDA468 cells but
not in HT29 and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The caspase3/caspase-7 activity was also increased in LNCap (4.9-fold) and
MDA468 (6.6-fold) cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Thus, micromolar CCI-779 seems to inhibit proliferation via a largely cytostatic
mechanism in most of the cells tested, whereas it induces apoptosis in the PTEN-negative tumor cells.

Micromolar inhibition of proliferation correlates with
FKBP12-independent inhibition of cellular mTOR signaling.
To define the mechanism responsible for high-dose growth
inhibition by CCI-779, we initially examined the effect of CCI-779
on cell proliferation and mTOR signaling at nanomolar versus
micromolar drug concentrations. These assays were done in the
absence or presence of FK506, which competes with CCI-779
for binding to intracelullular FKBP12. At low concentrations (e.g.,
20 nmol/L), CCI-779 exhibited an FK506-reversible inhibition of
growth (Fig. 2A), which correlated with the reversible dephosphorylation of mTOR substrates S6K1 (Thr389) and 4E-BP1 (Thr70;
Fig. 2B). In contrast, the inhibitory effects of high-dose CCI-779
(10–20 Amol/L) on growth and mTOR substrate phosphorylation
were not reversed by FK506, suggesting that high-dose CCI-779

Suppression of mTOR and Cancer Growth by Micromolar CCI-779

suppresses both mTOR signaling and cell growth through an
FKBP12-independent mechanism. The mTOR complex 2 is
insensitive to low concentrations of rapamycin and its analogues
(22, 23). However, the effects of higher drug concentrations on
this second mTOR complex are unclear. Consequently, we examined the phosphorylation state of the known mTORC2 substrate
AKT and its downstream target GSK-3 in CCI-779–treated cells.
At concentrations of 10 and 20 Amol/L, CCI-779 dramatically inhibited phosphorylation of Ser473 of AKT and Ser21/9 of GSK-3 with
maximal suppression of both responses observed after 24 h of drug
exposure (Fig. 2C). Partial inhibition of AKT and GSK-3 phosphorylation was also observed after 24 h of cellular treatment with a
low concentration (20 nmol/L) of CCI-779, and this CCI-779 effect
was fully reversed by cotreatment with FK506. The decreases in
AKT and GSK-3 phosphorylation after long-term CCI-779 exposure
were consistent with previous findings, and the blockade of the
CCI-779 effects by FK506 indicates that the low-dose effect of CCI779 was fully dependent on FKBP12. In contrast, FK506 cotreatment failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of 10 or 20 Amol/L
CCI-779. In fact, concomitant FK506 exposure noticeably augmented the acute (6 h) effects of CCI-779 on AKT and GSK-3
phosphorylation. Although the actual mechanism underlying this

enhancing effect is unknown, we speculate that FK506 may
saturate irrelevant binding sites (including those exposed by FKBP
family members), thereby increasing the pool of free intracellular
CCI-779.
CCI-779/rapamycin micromolar action requires binding
to the FRB domain of mTOR. Structural information regarding
the interactions between rapamycin, FKBP12, and the FRB domain
of mTOR has supported rational approaches to the generation
of rapamycin derivatives with varying affinities for FKBP12 or
FRB. We used select rapamycin analogues to further investigate the requirements for FKBP12 and/or mTOR binding in the
dose-dependent effects of CCI-779 on cell proliferation and signaling functions. WAY-179639, a triene-perturbed derivative,
retained potent FKBP12 binding (EC50, 8 nmol/L) but was inactive
in an FKBP12-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex formation assay
(EC50, >5,000 nmol/L; Fig. 3A). Interestingly, this compound
was not growth inhibitory against LNCap, HEK293 (Fig. 3B), and
other cells (data not shown) at the doses up to 30 Amol/L.
The observed lack of activity in proliferation assays is presumably
due to the lack of inhibition of cellular mTOR signaling as
evidenced by the normal levels of S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C).
To ascertain whether WAY-179639 actually penetrated cells, we

were assayed in growth inhibition by CCI-779 with 0, 5, and 10 Amol/L of FK506. The assays were done and analyzed as in Fig. 1. B, cells were plated in six-well plates
in growth media overnight, and treated for 6 h with indicated doses of CCI-779 with or without 5 and 10 Amol/L of FK506. Total cellular lysates were prepared and
subjected to immunoblotting. The blots were stained with Ponceau-S for total proteins and probed with antibodies for phosphorylated S6K1, total S6K1, phosphorylated
4E-BP1, cyclin D3, and p21/Cip1. Arrowheads, migration of phosphorylated versus dephosphorylated form of p70 S6K1. C, cells were similarly treated for 6 and

used it as a competitor against CCI-779 in a growth inhibition
assay. Cotreatment with WAY-179639 overcomes the growth
inhibitory effect of CCI-779 at concentrations of V10 Amol/L,
consistent with the ability of WAY-179639 to penetrate cells and

to compete with CCI-779 for binding to FKBP12 (Fig. 3D).
These results indicate that the high-dose inhibition of cell growth
by CCI-779 correlates with its ability to bind the mTOR FRB
domain.

in Materials and Methods. FK506, rapamycin, and WAY-179639 were assayed at 0.3 to 5,000 nmol/L for competing with [3H]FK506 for binding. An EC50 value was
determined as the dose required for 50% inhibition of bound radioactivity. Right bottom, FK506, rapamycin, and WAY-179639 were assayed at 0.1 to 5,000 nmol/L in an

supported complex formation. B, WAY-179639 and CCI-779 were assayed for growth inhibition in LNCap and HEK293 as in Fig. 1. Note that WAY-179639 was inactive
in both the nanomolar and micromolar inhibitions of growth. C, HEK293 cells were treated with the indicated doses of CCI-779 or WAY-179639 for 6 h and subjected

Suppression of mTOR and Cancer Growth by Micromolar CCI-779

Figure 4. mTOR kinase activity is inhibited directly by CCI-779 or rapamycin.
A, purified recombinant Flag-mTOR was assayed for phosphorylation of
His6-S6K1 or His6-4E-BP1 with indicated doses of CCI-779 as described in
Materials and Methods. Substrate phosphorylation was analyzed by
immunoblotting. The blots were stained with Ponceau-S for total substrate and
probed with antibodies against phosphorylated S6K1 and phosphorylated
4E-BP1. B, Flag-mTOR was assayed for phosphorylation of His6-S6K1 with
indicated doses of CCI-779 or rapamycin. Substrate phosphorylation was
measured by a 96-well format DELFIA as described in Materials and Methods.
Inhibition dose-response curves were plotted for generation of IC50 values.
The graph presented is based on mean values of at least three independent
experiments.

Direct inhibition of mTOR enzymatic activity by CCI-779 and
rapamycin in the absence of FKBP12. To obtain biochemical
evidence of inhibition of mTOR directly by CCI-779 and rapamycin,
we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified, recombinant
Flag-mTOR in the presence of various concentrations of CCI-779
without FKBP12. Assay products were first analyzed by immunoblot
analysis with phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation
of both mTOR substrates, His6-S6K1 (Thr389) and His6-4E-BP1
(Thr46), tested in these assays was inhibited by CCI-779 at
concentrations of z800 nmol/L (Fig. 4A). Direct inhibition of
mTOR kinase activity was quantified with a DELFIA-based mTOR
kinase assay using His6-S6K1 as the substrate (19). Pooled data from
three experiments yielded mean IC50 values of 1.76 F 0.15 and 1.74
F 0.34 Amol/L for CCI-779 and rapamycin, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Our results show that both CCI-779 and rapamycin directly inhibit
mTOR catalytic activity in the absence of FKBP12. Furthermore, the
IC50 values for rapamycin obtained in our DELFIA assay were well
correlated with those reported in a recent study in which mTOR
activity was measured in an immune complex kinase assay (24).
FRB mutant mTOR-SI confers resistance to nanomolar and
micromolar CCI-779 inhibitions in vitro and in vivo. Rapamycin-resistant mTOR alleles can be created by substitution of a

www.aacrjournals.org

conserved residue Ser2035 in the FRB domain with a more bulky
amino acid, such as isoleucine (21, 25). To assess whether CCI-779
shows a similar dependence on Ser2035 for binding to the FRB
domain in the absence of FKBP12, we examined the sensitivity of an
mTOR (Ser2035!Ile) mutant, termed mTOR-SI, to CCI-779 in the
presence or absence of FKBP12. Wild-type Flag-mTOR was efficiently
inhibited by the FKBP12-rapamycin complex (IC50, 11 F 1 nmol/L);
however, mTOR-SI was not inhibited by the immunophilin-drug
complex at concentrations of up to 160 nmol/L (Fig. 5A, top). In the
parallel assays without FKBP12, inhibition of mTOR-SI was only
observed at drug concentrations considerably higher than those
required for inhibition of wild-type mTOR. The mean IC50 value of
20 F 3.2 Amol/L (Fig. 5A, bottom) for CCI-779 was f11-fold higher
than that measured with the wild-type mTOR enzyme (Fig. 4B).
Thus, the Ser2035!Ile mutation in the FRB domain also confers a
substantial resistance to CCI-779 in the absence of FKBP12.
To determine whether these results could be extended to intact
cells, we generated HEK293 cell–derived stable cell lines expressing
either the control vector or mTOR-SI allele. Phosphorylation of
S6K1 at Thr389 and AKT at Ser473 and autophosphorylation of mTOR
itself at Ser2481 was restored in mTOR-SI cells acutely (6 h) treated
with 0.02 Amol/L CCI-779, consistent with previously published
studies (Fig. 5B; refs. 26, 27). Importantly, compared with vector
control, mTOR-SI cells were also protected against the inhibition of
above markers by 10 Amol/L and, to a lesser extent, by 20 Amol/L
CCI-779 (Fig. 5B). We further investigated whether such restoration
of mTOR signaling is sufficient to rescue long-term (3 days) growth
suppression induced by various concentrations of CCI-779. As
expected, although the vector control cells showed 55% reduction in
growth in response to 0.05 Amol/L CCI-779, growth of mTOR-SI
cells was inhibited only minimally (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, although
15 and 20 Amol/L drug equally inhibited the growth of both vector
and mTOR-SI cells, mTOR-SI cells remained significantly more
resistant to 1 and 10 Amol/L CCI-779 (Fig. 5C). The failure of mTORSI cells to exhibit significant protection against higher doses of CCI779 is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that the mTORC1
complexes in these cells contain both wild-type mTOR (rapamycinsensitive) and mTOR-SI mutant (rapamycin-resistant) proteins.
Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that the micromolar
effects of CCI-779/rapamycin in the cells are specifically mediated
through mTOR and require the binding of the drug to FRB.
Micromolar CCI-779 profoundly inhibits cellular translation. Treatment of sensitive cell types with low concentrations of
rapamycin provokes the accumulation of cells in G1 phase of cell
cycle, in part due to the translational suppression of a subset of
proliferation-related mRNAs, including the c-Myc and cyclin D1
transcripts (28, 29). The considerably more profound inhibition of
cellular proliferation induced by high-dose CCI-779 treatment
prompted more detailed analysis of the effects of micromolar
CCI-779 on global protein synthesis. We first measured serumstimulated incorporation of radiolabeled methionine into newly
synthesized proteins in LNCap, HCT116, and HEK293 cells after
acute treatment with 20 nmol/L and 20 Amol/L CCI-779. In cell
populations treated with 20 nmol/L CCI-779, no significant
inhibition of protein synthesis was observed in any of the tested
populations (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast,
treatment with 20 Amol/L CCI-779 strongly inhibited global
translational activity to a level comparable with that observed
with a benchmark protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Such
profound suppression of global protein synthesis by micromolar
CCI-779 is unlikely due to a secondary response of the cells to the

growth delay, as an unrelated control drug Taxol, a potent cell
growth inhibitor, was not active in this assay. To extend these
findings, we analyzed polysome profiles of HEK293 and HCT116
cells treated with 0.02 or 20 Amol/L CCI-779 (Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S2B). These studies revealed that 0.02 Amol/L
CCI-779 caused a significant decrease in the ratio of polysomes to
monosomes, an effect consistent with previously reported for
rapamycin (30, 31). However, exposure to 20 Amol/L CCI-779
caused much more profound reduction in polysomes, accompanied
by a strong increase in the 80S monosomal peak. Thus, the dramatic decrease in translational activity induced by 20 Amol/L CCI779 is likely related to the disassembly of actively translating
polysomes into monosomes.
Modulation of phosporylation of multiple translation
factors. To shed light on the mechanism underlying the
translational arrest provoked by high-dose CCI-779, we investigated
phosphorylation states of several translation factors in HEK293
cells treated with 0.02, 10, or 20 Amol/L CCI-779, with or without
10 Amol/L FK506, to competitively inhibit the binding of CCI-779 to
FKBP12. Consistent with the profound suppression of translational activity (Fig. 6A and B), we observed striking increase in
inhibitory phosphorylations of eukaryotic translation initiation
factor eIF2a on Ser51 and eukaryotic translation elongation factor
eEF2 on Thr56 (Fig. 6C). Both of these alterations occurred within
1-hour exposure to 10 to 20 Amol/L CCI-779 and were not reversed
by concomitant exposure to FK506 (Fig. 6C). Similar results
were obtained in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells exposed to 10 to
20 Amol/L CCI-779 (Supplementary Fig. S2C, left). It is also
noteworthy that micromolar CCI-779 induced accumulation of the
transcription factor ATF-4 (Fig. 6C, left), which might be secondary
to the phosphorylation of eIF2a.
The nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2 complex is negatively
regulated by phosphorylation of eIF2a subunit on Ser51 in response
to numerous growth inhibitory signals (32), although a role for
mTOR in regulating eIF2a in mammalian cells has not been
reported. The phosphorylation of key inhibitory residue Thr56 in
eEF2 is attributed to the activation of eEF2K, which itself is
regulated by an inhibitory phosphorylation event on Ser366. The
mTORC1-stimulated protein kinase S6K1 has been identified as
one of the upstream effectors of eEF2K phosphorylation at Ser366
(33). Nevertheless, the eEF2 phosphorylation elicited by micromolar CCI-779 seemed to involve an S6K1-independent mechanism
because it did not correlate with S6K1 activity or Ser366
phosphorylation of eEF2K (Fig. 6C, right). To further explore the
role of eEF2K in eEF2 phosphorylation, we depleted this protein
from HCT116 cells using specific siRNAs. Knockdown of eEF2K
completely abolished the eEF2 (Thr56) phosphorylation induced by
high-dose CCI-779 (Supplementary Fig. S2C, right), indicating that
eEF2K was fully responsible for the dramatic increase in eEF2
(Thr56) phosphorylation seen in these cells. A similar result was
observed in U87MG glioma cells (data not shown). The exact
mechanism whereby high-dose CCI-779 activates eEF2K remains to
be elucidated; regardless, the combined effects of this drug on
eIF2a and eEF2 phosphorylation suggest that high-dose CCI-779
interferes with cellular protein synthesis by blocking both the
initiation and elongation steps of translation.

Discussion
CCI-779 blocks growth of different types of tumors, in part, by
inducing G1 arrest and inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells.

Suppression of mTOR and Cancer Growth by Micromolar CCI-779

Although some malignancies respond well to CCI-779 treatment,
others exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance to the drug both in
preclinical or clinical settings. In this report, we showed for the first
time that increasing concentrations of CCI-779 to 10 to 20 Amol/L
not only led to a sharp decrease in proliferation of sensitive cells,
but also overcame the resistance of many tumor cell lines to the
drug, such as colon cancer cells HCT116 or HT29. Similar doses of
rapamycin were used in several reports; however, this phenomenon

has been neither noted nor studied previously (34–36). We showed
that the profound antiproliferative effect of micromolar CCI-779 is
largely attributed to its cytostatic action on most of the tested cells;
however, it also elicits apoptotic response in some PTEN-negative
tumor cells.
Whereas the mechanisms of intrinsic resistance of tumor cells
to the nanomolar CCI-779 and rapamycin analogues in general are
not fully defined, deregulation of several signaling pathways is

known to contribute to the sensitivity of cancer cells to rapamycin
and its analogues in vitro and in vivo. For example, breast, prostate, or renal cancer cell lines that display a loss of PTEN or VHL
tumor suppressors or an activation of AKT signaling are more
sensitive to CCI-779 inhibition (37–39). Response of tumor cells
to the commonly used nanomolar concentrations of rapamycin
may be limited by the feedback loop, whereas suppression of
S6K1 signaling by rapamycin stimulates IRS-PI3K pathway to
promote AKT activity. Herein, we found that micromolar CCI-779
dramatically reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, as
evidenced by the decrease in the phosphorylation of Thr389 of
S6K1, Thr70 of 4E-BP1, as well as phosphorylation of Ser473 of
AKT and Ser9/21 of GSK-3, which may in part contribute to the
uniform inhibition of proliferation in our cell line panel by
micromolar CCI-779. It is also interesting to speculate that
micromolar CCI-779 may disrupt the function of both mTORC1
and mTORC2 complexes in cancer cells in a more efficient manner
than nanomolar compound. Further studies will be needed to
address this hypothesis.
We found that the profound inhibition of mTOR signaling
and cell proliferation elicited by micromolar CCI-779 did not
require FKBP12, suggesting that FKBP12 independent binding
of CCI-779 to the FRB domain of mTOR is required for the observed
phenotypes. This view is further supported by the observation
that an FRB-binding defective rapamycin analogue failed to
display any growth inhibitory properties, even at micromolar
concentrations. These results implicate the rapamycin triene
interaction with FRB as necessary for both the nanomolar and
micromolar dose activity of the drug. Additional findings helped
to explain the mechanism of micromolar CCI-779 action at the
biochemical level. First, CCI-779 was able to inhibit mTOR
kinase activity at micromolar doses directly in the absence of
FKBP12, with an IC50 value of 1.76 Amol/L. Second, the kinase
activity of the FRB mutant mTOR-SI was 11-fold more resistant
to the micromolar CCI-779 compared with the wild-type mTOR.
mTOR-SI also conferred a partial protection to mTOR signaling
and cell growth in response to micromolar doses of CCI-779.
The lack of significant resistance of mTOR-SI cells to the growth
inhibitory effect of the drug at the highest concentrations (z15
Amol/L) can be explained by the fact that (a) endogenously
expressed wild-type mTOR allele renders at least a subset of
mTORC1 complexes sensitive to CCI-779, (b) mTOR-SI allele
seems to be hypomorphic with respect to reconstitution of
mTORC1 signaling functions (25), and (c) the mTOR-SI mutant
enzyme is partially inhibited by 10 to 20 Amol/L CCI-779 in vitro
(Fig. 5A). Together, our current findings are in accord with
recent reports that rapamycin is able to bind FRB domain of
mTOR directly, without FKBP12, and our IC50 value for CCI-779
agrees well with K d value reported in these studies (12, 24, 40).
These reports, however, do not address biological effects of direct
interactions between rapamycin and FRB on mTOR signaling in
the cells.
mTOR kinase coordinates protein synthesis and abundance of
the various components of the translational machinery with the
continuous changes in nutrient, mitogen, or energy status of the
cell. Despite numerous studies implicating mTOR in control of
general translational factors, the effects of nanomolar rapamycin
on global protein synthesis rates are subtle and cell selective.
A marked reduction in general protein synthesis in response to
micromolar CCI-779, as indicated by both methionine incorporation and polysome profiles data, suggests a potential mechanism

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

for the suppression of cell proliferation at elevated concentrations
of the drug. In our studies, micromolar CCI-779 dramatically
increased the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor
eIF2a on Ser51 and elongation factor eEF2 on Thr56 in an FKBP12independent manner. It is likely that modulation of the above
factors, as well as reduction in phosphorylation of S6K1 and
4E-BP1, may collectively contribute to the observed decrease in
global protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of eIF2a on Ser51 by four
kinases (PERK, GCN2, PKR, HRI) inhibits eIF2a-GTP-Met-tRNA
ternary complex formation and results in attenuation of global
protein synthesis under diverse stress conditions (32). The kinase(s)
that phosphorylates eIF2a following the exposure to micromolar CCI-779 remains to be determined. It is well established
that phosphorylation of Thr56 of eEF2 by eEF2K decreases
elongation rates and blocks protein synthesis in transformed
human cells (41, 42). mTOR mediates inhibitory phosphorylation of
three sites on eEF2K: Ser366 via S6K1, Ser359 and Ser78 through the
unknown kinases (43). Our results indicate that stimulation of
Thr56 of eEF2 by micromolar CCI-779 is not mediated by
dephosphorylation of eEF2K at Ser366 or modulated by S6K1.
It is likely that phosphorylation changes in residue(s) other
than Ser366 and/or other biochemical mechanism(s) may mediate
eEF2K activation and eEF2 hyperphosphorylation. Whereas AMPK
pathway also impinges on eEF2K in certain cellular contexts,
preincubation of cancer cells with compound C, a direct and
specific inhibitor of AMPK, did not eliminate the effect of
micromolar CCI-779 on eEF2 phosphorylation (data not shown).
Finally, the silencing of eEF2K using siRNA prevented the effects
of micromolar CCI-779 on eEF2 phosphorylation, thus substantiating the role of eEF2K in regulating eEF2 activity under above
conditions. Alternative mode of regulation independent on eEF2K
cannot be ruled out where the exposure to micromolar dose of
CCI-779 may suppress the activity of PP2A phosphatase, thereby
delaying the rate of Thr56 dephosphorylation. Similar mechanism
was recently proposed for the ethanol-induced eEF2 phosphorylation in C2C12 myocytes (44).
Whereas it remains an open question whether this newly
described mechanism of CCI-779 action contributes to antitumor efficacy in the clinic, a number of recent clinical studies
suggest that micromolar drug levels are present in blood of
CCI-779–treated patients with breast cancer (1), advanced renal
cancer (15), and malignant glioma (16). Therefore, the high-dose
drug concentrations that are used in our work are well within
the clinically relevant drug concentrations. Interestingly, in a
randomized phase II renal cancer trial, patients who received
the highest weekly dose of CCI-779 of 250 mg (whole blood
exposure of 16 Ag/mL) had a higher median survival and
higher probability of survival than those in the lower dosage
groups (15). Therefore, we speculate that the newly described
pharmacologic effects exerted by micromolar CCI-779/rapamycin action in cancer cells contribute to its therapeutic efficacy
in vivo.
