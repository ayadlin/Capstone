ABSTRACT
Drug resistance and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching limit conventional
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although several small molecule drugs
are clinically used, single drug administration is not sufficient to cure AML, which has
a high molecular diversity. Metabolic homeostasis plays a key role in determining
cellular fate. Appropriate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) maintain the
redox system balance, and excessive amounts of ROS cause oxidative damage,
thus providing a strategy to eliminate cancer cells. CPPTL is a novel analogue of
parthenolide that exhibited significant cytotoxicity to AML cells in vitro and induced
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, CPPTL’s prodrug DMA-CPPTL
decreased the burden of AML engraftment and prolonged survival in a mouse model
administered human primary AML cells in vivo. CPPTL induced apoptosis of AML cells
by stimulating ROS production, and accumulation of ROS then activated the JNK
pathway, thereby promoting mitochondrial damage. These results demonstrated that
CPPTL effectively eradicated AML cells in vitro and in vivo and suggested that CPPTL
may be a novel candidate for auxiliary AML therapy.

INTRODUCTION

of normal physiological processes and maintenance of
the redox balance [7, 8]. Excessive generation of ROS
causes cellular damage and apoptosis [9], which has
been proposed as an approach to eliminate cancer cells.
Stimulation of ROS generation has anti-tumor effects
against cancers including lung cancer [10], gastric cancer
[11], bladder cancer [12], cervical cancer [13], esophageal
cancer [14]. Indeed, several novel small molecules that
induce apoptosis through ROS-dependent pathways have
been investigated in leukemic cells. Claudia P. Miller has
reported that the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 induces
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) apoptotic cell death in vitro
and in vivo by increasing the ROS levels [15]. Michele
Milella has found that perturbation of AML cell redox
status may play a role in the observed pro-apoptotic
synergism between MEK inhibitors and retinoid [16].

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most
common hematological malignancy in adults [1].
Chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
transplantation are conventional treatments for AML
[2, 3]. However, approximately 30%-40% of AML
patients cannot receive HSC transplantation, because of
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching limitation.
Moreover, the sequelae of autologous or allogeneic HSC
transplantation can affect patient quality of life [4]. In
addition, some patients are resistant to chemotherapeutics
[5, 6], and high-dose chemotherapy drugs can cause severe
side effects. Therefore, screening selective small molecule
drugs for AML treatment is necessary and urgent.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are small,
highly reactive molecules, play key roles in the regulation

CPPTL decreased engraftment of primary AML
samples and prolonged survival in a mouse
model

Therefore, stimulating excessive ROS generation may be
an adjuvant therapy for leukemia.
Apoptosis results from caspase activation and two wellstudied evolutionarily conserved pathways: the cell surface
death receptor pathway [17, 18] and the mitochondriainitiated pathway [19]. In the mitochondria-initiated pathway,
the BCL-2 family, comprising antiapoptotic proteins, such as
BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1, and proapoptotic proteins,
such as BAX and BAK, have key roles in regulating
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. The ratio of
these two types of proteins, such as BCL-2/BAX, controls
the threshold of susceptibility to apoptosis [20]. If the
balance of BCL-2/BAX is disrupted, and the ratio decreases,
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) decreases and
induces release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c and Apaf1 recruit pro-caspase-9, thus facilitating formation of the
apoptosome complex. Activated caspase-9 cleaves and
then activates pro-caspase-3, which triggers apoptosis [20].
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is one of the major
substrate of caspase-3 in vivo, and cleaved PARP facilitates
cellular disassembly and induces apoptosis [21, 22].
Extending these previous findings, we herein report
that the small molecule CPPTL exhibits cytotoxicity
in vitro and decreases latency for AML development
in vivo. Our study revealed that CPPTL induces apoptosis
of AML cells by rapidly stimulating ROS generation,
thereby rapidly triggering downstream caspase activation.

CPPTL exhibited significant anti-leukemic
effects in vitro, which prompted us to evaluate the
effects of CPPTL in vivo by using a NOD/SCID
xenotransplantation mouse model. However, CPPTL
showed weak solubility in water. Therefore, CPPTL
was converted to its prodrug, DMA-CPPTL (Figure
2B). The protocol for the in vivo experiment is shown
in Figure 2A. We transplanted 30 NOD/SCID mice
with primary human AML MNCs and randomly divided
into three groups immediately. As shown in Figure 2C,
DMA-CPPTL, compared with the vehicle control and
the positive control adriamycin (ADR), significantly
prolonged the survival of mice. Flow cytometry was used
to analyze the percentage of CD45+ cells in bone marrow
after AML mice died naturally; the results indicated the
engraftment level of AML. Compared with the vehicle
control, the conventional chemotherapy drug ADR did
not substantially prevent invasion of leukemic cells.
However, the DMA-CPPTL treatment group exhibited
lower engraftment of leukemic cells (Figure 2D). Half
of the mice treated with DMA-CPPTL had lower levels
of engraftment (<5%), but almost all ADR-treated mice
exhibited high levels of engraftment (> 40%) (Figure
2E). These results suggested that CPPTL effectively
eliminated leukemic cells in vivo and improved the
survival of NOD/SCID mice transplanted with primary
AML cells.

RESULTS
CPPTL inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis

CPPTL induced apoptosis by stimulating ROS
generation

CPPTL, whose chemical structure is shown in
Figure 1A, is a cyclopropyl analogue of parthenolide [23].
To determine whether CPPTL had anti-leukemic effects,
we determined its effects on five typical leukemia cell
lines: HL-60 (APL cell line), HL-60/ADR (ADR-resistant
APL cell line), K562 (CML cell line), K562/ADR (ADRresistant CML cell line) and KG1a (AML cell line). CPPTL
exhibited significant cytotoxicity to leukemic cells (Figure
1B). For sensitive cell lines, CPPTL was more specific to
acute leukemia cells than chronic leukemia cells. Because
HL-60 represents only acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), we therefore selected KG1a to perform subsequent
phenotypic and mechanistic studies. In particular, CPPTL
induced apoptosis of KG1a and primary AML cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C and 1F). Moreover,
we collected fifteen primary AML samples with different
subtypes of AML to test the effects of CPPTL (Table 1).
CPPTL, compared with the vehicle control, eliminated
more than 70% of AML cells at 5 μM (Figure 1D). In
contrast, CPPTL did not induce significant cytotoxic
effects in normal mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from
human umbilical cord blood in vitro (Figure 1E).

Apoptosis is involved in an increase in
mitochondrial membrane permeability and release of
cytochrome c, thus decreasing ΔΨm. A fluorescent
dye, tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl-ester (TMRE), was
used to examine ΔΨm with flow cytometry to quantify
apoptosis. TMRE binds to the mitochondrial membrane
only when ΔΨm is high; otherwise, it is released from
the mitochondrial membrane. Cytochrome c was released
(Figure 3A), and ΔΨm was decreased (Figure 3B) after
CPPTL treatment, thus indicating that CPPTL induced
mitochondria-initiated apoptosis. We detected ROS levels
of KG1a cells after CPPTL treatment for 24 hours to
determine whether CPPTL-induced apoptosis is facilitated
by intracellular ROS accumulation. CPPTL stimulated
ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
3C and 3F), and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a free radical
scavenger, prevented CPPTL-induced ROS accumulation
after co-treatment with CPPTL and NAC (Figure 3D).
Moreover, NAC effectively inhibited apoptosis of KG1a
cells induced by treatment with different concentrations

of CPPTL (Figure 3E). Through monitoring the dynamic
ROS levels, we found that in contrast to other ROS
activators, CPPTL stimulated ROS production rapidly
within 15 minutes. ROS levels peaked in 30 minutes, and
subsequently, ROS levels decreased and were maintained
at a certain level (Figure 3G). In summary, these data
revealed that CPPTL stimulated production of ROS, thus
inducing apoptosis.

As shown in Figure 5, we hypothesized that CPPTL
induces apoptosis by inducing ROS generation, which
subsequently leads to activation of JNK. Phosphorylated
JNK may inhibit the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 and then
promote release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Free
cytochrome c may bind to Apaf-1 and consequently recruit
pro-caspase-9, thus allowing formation of the apoptosome.
The apoptosome then cleaves caspase-9, activates procaspase-3 and PARP, and ultimately induces apoptosis.

JNK activation contributed to CPPTL-induced
apoptosis of AML cells

DISCUSSION

Our study demonstrated that CPPTL promotes ROS
production, thereby inducing apoptosis. Several factors
are known to activate mitochondria-initiated apoptosis.
However, the protein that is activated to trigger this series
of reaction is not known. As shown in Figure 4A, CPPTL
promoted phosphorylation of JNK and p38 and decreased
expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in a dosedependent manner. Although the pro-apoptotic protein Bax
also decreased, there was no effect on apoptosis of KG1a
cells treated with CPPTL. Notably, cleavage of caspase-9,
caspase-3 and PARP, key proteins associated with apoptotic
activation, increased in a dose-dependent manner.
To validate the effects of ROS in this pathway, we
used NAC to block ROS and then analyzed the protein
expression. As shown in Figure 4B, NAC substantially
blocked the CPPTL-induced phosphorylation of JNK and
p38, the release of cytochrome c, the decrease in Bcl-2,
and the cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP, but
NAC had no effect on any of these events.

AML is the most common acute leukemia in
adults, accounting for ~80 percent of cases in this group
[24]. Given the complexity of AML classification,
the most common treatments in clinical use are still
chemotherapy and HSC transplantation. Nevertheless,
researchers are still exploring the molecular mechanisms
underlying the origin of AML to find more effective
drug targets. In recent years, FLT3-ITD [25], STAT
[26, 27] and IDH1/IDH2 [28] have been identified as
effective therapeutic targets, and several inhibitors of
these proteins are currently undergoing clinical trials. In
addition, monoclonal antibodies [29] and CART therapy
[30] remain research hotspots. Although novel targeted
therapies hold promise for effective anti-leukemia
treatment with low toxicity from off-target effects, single
drug administration is insufficient to cure AML, which
has a high molecular diversity. Therefore, combinations
of different treatment methods and therapeutic targets are
necessary.

In both normal cells and cancer cells, homeostasis
of cellular metabolism determines the cellular fate.
Indeed, disrupting this balance may be a potential
therapeutic strategy to eradicate cancer cells. Increasing
evidence indicates that ROS stress is different between
normal cells and cancer cells. ROS are essential for

biological functions and participate in signaling cell
growth and differentiation, regulating the activity of
enzymes, mediating inflammation by stimulating cytokine
production, and eliminating pathogens [31, 32]. The effect
of ROS on cancer cells is double-edged. A certain amount
of ROS can promote the proliferation of cancer cells, but

excessive amounts of ROS cause oxidative damage to kill
the cancer cells [33]. Thus, manipulating ROS levels is
a strategy to selectively eliminate cancer cells without
causing toxicity to normal cells [34]. Therefore, our group
has studied the relationship between ROS and leukemia
and has screened novel agents targeting leukemia. On the
basis of our previous studies, we evaluated a novel small
molecule compound, CPPTL, and its anti-leukemia effect.
CPPTL exhibited significant anti-leukemic effects
in vitro and in vivo. For common AML cell lines, CPPTL
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, CPPTL was more specific
to AML than CML. NOD/SICD mouse model assays
demonstrated that DMA-CPPTL, a water soluble prodrug
of CPPTL, decreased the capacity of primary AML sample
xenotransplantation in vivo. DMA-CPPTL, compared with
the vehicle control and positive control, prolonged the
survival time significantly, and the percentage of CD45+
cell engraftment was lower. These results suggested that

CPPTL may be a promising anti-leukemia drug candidate.
In addition, we found that CPPTL induced apoptosis
by stimulating ROS generation, thereby triggering JNK
pathway activation. ROS levels were sustainably maintained
at a certain level; nevertheless ROS increased rapidly after
CPPTL treatment, within 15 min. Excessive ROS promotes
phosphorylation of JNK and activates mitochondriainitiated apoptosis [35]. JNK has multiple targets, including
Bcl-2 family members, which bind to the mitochondrial
membrane [36]. In fact, phosphorylated JNK should
promote Bax by inhibiting Bcl-2. However, in our western
blot results, the Bax expression unexpectedly decreased. We
hypothesized that although Bax expression decreased, Bcl-2
was decreased even more. Therefore the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax
also decreased and triggered ΔΨm alteration, thus inducing
release of cytochrome c. After cytochrome c was free from
the mitochondria, apoptosis was induced.
Moreover, CPPTL exhibited a strong ability to
kill drug-resistant CML cells compared with sensitive

CML cells, thus suggesting that CPPTL might overcome
drug-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
Indeed, it has been reported that ROS has a key role in
inducing apoptosis or death in drug-resistant cancer cells.
Muhammad Altaf et al. have synthesized new bipyridine
gold(III) dithiocarbamate-containing complexes that
have potent anticancer capacity against cisplatin-resistant
cancer cells by increasing ROS levels [37]. In addition to
solid tumors, the novel agent RRx-001 overcomes drug
resistance in multiple myeloma cells via release of ROS to
activate caspase [38]. More importantly, in 2007, Jennifer
S. Carew et al. have reported that the combination of
chloroquine and SAHA augments anticancer activity by
targeting autophagy, thus overcoming Bcr-Abl-mediated
drug resistance, and the generation of ROS plays an
important role during this process [39].
ROS play a decisive role in eradicating AML stem
cells [40]. AML stem cells tend to have a lower metabolic
activity and thus lower ROS production than AML cells
overall. Lagadinou Eleni D has demonstrated that the
majority of AML stem cells are enriched in ROS-low cell
populations, and Bcl-2 is overexpressed in this group [41].
Several compounds target leukemia stem cells through
ROS production [41–45]. Integration of ROS with other
key LSC signaling interference strategies had powerful
toxic effects on AML stem cells [40]. Our group has
focused on the effects of small molecules on AML and
AML stem cells through ROS production [46, 47]. In
addition, compared with other AML cell lines, KG1a cells
exhibit a CD34+CD38- LSC-like phenotype. Collectively,
CPPTL may have the potential to target LSC selectively.
Thus, our future research will focus on the effects of
CPPTL on drug-resistant CML and AML stem cells.
In conclusion, we report that CPPTL can eliminate
AML cells in vitro and in vivo. CPPTL activates the JNK
pathway and consequently induces mitochondria-initiated
apoptosis by stimulating ROS production. In conclusion,
our results suggested that modulation of ROS levels
may be used as an auxiliary method of AML treatment.
However, the detailed mechanisms underlying CPPTL
function have not been elucidated. Therefore, more indepth research and optimization should be carried out in
future studies.

FBS/10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Primary human
AML samples were retrieved and cultured in serum-free
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM).

Synthesis of CPPTL and DMA-CPPTL
CPPTL was synthesized according to our previously
reported procedure [23]. The compound was dissolved in
DMSO and stored at –80°C at a concentration of 20 mM.
The compound was diluted with relevant medium for
cellular experiments.
A mixture of CPPTL (590 mg, 2.4 mmol), Me2NH.
HCl (2.94 g, 36 mmol), CH2Cl2 (120 mL), and K2CO3
(9.95 g) was heated to reflux for 5 h. The reaction mixture
was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced
pressure to yield a crude solid, which was purified on
silica gel column, thus yielding a white solid (645 mg).
The resulting solid was dissolved in methanol, and then,
fumaric acid (257 mg) was added. The mixture was stirred
10 min at room temperature and then concentrated under
reduced pressure to give DMA-CPPTL (902 mg, 92%).

MTT cell proliferation assay
Briefly, leukemia cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 5×103cells/ well. Cells were treated
with CPPTL at a concentration gradient for 72 h. After
treatment, MTT was added at a final concentration of
0.5 mg/ml and allowed to react with cells for 4 h. The
formazan precipitate was dissolved in DMSO, and the
absorbance was read at 570 nm.

Apoptosis assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apoptosis of KG-1a cells and primary human
AML samples was detected with an Annexin V-FITC/PI
Apoptosis Detection Kit (SUNGENE BIOTECH, China).
KG-1a cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of
1 × 105cells/well for 24 h and treated with CPPTL alone or
together with 5 mM NAC. Primary human AML samples
were cultured in 24-well plates treated with CPPTL for
24 h, at a density range from 2×105 to 5×105cells/well
depending on the total cell numbers of different samples.
After 24 h, cells were washed with cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), re-suspended in 1×binding buffer

ROS detection

Authorsʼ contributions

ROS levels were detected with a Reactive Oxygen
Species Assay Kit (Beyotime, China). Before CPPTL
treatment, DCFH-DA was added in the culture medium at
a final concentration of 10 μM. Then, 1 × 105 KG1a cells
were seeded in 24-well plate with medium containing
DCFH-DA and treated with CPPTL. After treatment, the
cells were collected and washed three times with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). All samples were analyzed with a
BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).

Western blotting

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

KG1a cells (1 × 106) were incubated with the
indicated concentrations of CPPTL and washed with
PBS, then lysed for 30 min on ice. The supernatant was
centrifuged and collected to determine the total protein
concentration by using BCA reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, America). Aliquots of protein extract samples
(~20 µg) were separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) - polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% skim milk
for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated
with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in PBST at
4°C overnight and then washed three times with PBST
before being incubated with the corresponding secondary
antibodies for 2 h at room temperature (1:20,000 dilution
with PBST). The immunoreactive bands were detected
with Western Lightning Plus-ECL reagent (PerkinElmer,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
The following primary antibodies were used: anti-βactin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), anti-Bcl-2 (#4223), antiPhospho-p38 (#4511), anti-Bax (#5023), anti-Caspase-9
(#9502), anti-PARP (#9532), and anti-Caspase-3 (#9665),
all of which were from Cell Signaling Technology, USA.
