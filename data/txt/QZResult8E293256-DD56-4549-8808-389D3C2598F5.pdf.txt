ABSTRACT
Oncogenic protein E6 of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is believed
to involve in the aberrant methylation in cervical cancer as it upregulates DNA
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) through tumor suppressor p53. In addition, DNA
demethylating agent induces the expression of one of the HPV-16 E6 regulated
microRNAs (miRs), miR-23b, in human cervical carcinoma SiHa cells. Thus, the
importance of DNA methylation and miR-23b in HPV-16 E6 associated cervical cancer
development is investigated. In the present study, however, it is found that miR-23b
is not embedded in any typical CpG island. Nevertheless, a functional CpG island is
predicted in the promoter region of C9orf3, the host gene of miR-23b, and is validated
by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing analyses. Besides,
c-MET is confirmed to be a target gene of miR-23b. Silencing of HPV-16 E6 is found to
increase the expression of miR-23b, decrease the expression of c-MET and thus induce
the apoptosis of SiHa cells through the c-MET downstream signaling pathway. Taken
together, the tumor suppressive miR-23b is epigenetically inactivated through its
host gene C9orf3 and this is probably a critical pathway during HPV-16 E6 associated
cervical cancer development.

transactivation or transrepression in ways similar as that
for the protein-coding genes [5]. The transcription factors,
such as p53, c-myc, E2F and NFκB, were reported to be
involved in the regulation of miRNA expressions [5–8].
On the other hand, the regulation of miRNAs may also be
at the post-transcriptional level, such as miRNA maturation
process. Discrepancies among the levels of primary
transcript, precursor and mature miRNA species have
been reported. The biogenesis of mature miRNAs mainly
involves two RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer.
Previous studies showed that a large fraction of miRNA
might be regulated at the Drosha processing step [4, 9].
Epigenetic
modification
such
as
DNA
hypermethylation often results in the silencing of genes
while aberrant DNA methylation is detected in many
cancers. Thus, epigenetic silencing may also be one
of the possible mechanisms that contribute to miRNA
regulation, especially for miRNAs that with tumor
suppressive function, such as miR-124a and 127 [10,

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNA (miR), a class of small non-coding
single-stranded RNA of 19 to 24 nucleotides in length,
is recently believed to participate in the development of
cancer, including cervical cancer. The main function of
miR is to repress the expression of target mRNA by either
cleavage or translational silencing. The silencing action
depends on the degree of complementation of miRNA
sequence with the 3’-UTR of target mRNAs [1–3].
“Knowing” the mechanisms that regulate the
expression of miRNAs is critical in understanding the
role of miRs in cervical cancer development. So far, the
molecular mechanisms however remain largely unknown.
Several microarray profiling studies showed that the
expression pattern of a large number of miRNAs can be
attributed to the regulatory sequences present in their
promoters [4]. Therefore, miRNAs may probably be
controlled by nuclear transcription factors through either

11]. Oncogenic viruses, such as human papillomavirus
(HPV), are often thought to be involved in the alteration
of DNA methylation in the host cells, a process appears
to be critical in cancer progression [12–14]. In fact, DNA
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), a major enzyme for DNA
methylation, was found to be overexpressed in human
cervical cancer [15].
Nearly half of the miRNAs are located within
the introns of protein-coding genes or non-coding
transcriptional units, which are known as the host genes.
miR-23b is located in the intron 14 of the host gene
C9orf3 on chromosome 9. Recent studies showed that the
expression of miR-23b could be regulated via the upstream
promoter region of the host gene [5, 16] and may also be
epigenetically regulated.
One of the target genes identified for miR-23b is
c-MET, which is believed to act as a protooncogene and
participate in cell proliferation [17, 18]. c-MET was also
overexpressed in many human solid tumors including
uterine cervix carcinomas and its overexpression served
as an important prognostic indicator [19, 20].
In the present study, HPV-16 E6 was confirmed to
regulate miR-23b indirectly through the DNA methylation
of host gene C9orf3 and thus induce c-MET and inhibit
apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. The uniqueness and the
significance for indirect epigenetic regulation pathway of
miRs, from the host gene C9orf3 to miR-23b, is worth
further investigation.

in miR-23b expression, ectopic expression of HPV-16
E6 in HCT116 parental and DK cells was carried out
by transfecting the cells with HPV-16 E6 cDNA [22].
HPV-16 E6 suppressed miR-23b expression in HCT116
parental cells but failed in the DK cells, indicating that
the suppression effect of HPV-16 E6 on miR-23b was
mediated through DNMTs (Figure 1B). On the other
hand, in HPV-16 E6 positive human cervical cancer SiHa
cells, knockdown of HPV-16 E6 by E6 siRNA increased
the miR-23b level in cells. Such increase, however, was
lessened by 84% upon the co-transfection with DNMT1
cDNA (Figure 1C). This further indicated that DNMT1
might mediate the suppressive effect of HPV-16 E6 on
miR-23b.

Lack of CG rich region in the miR-23b upstream
sequence
DNMT1 is known to regulate the expression of
genes through DNA methylation. Whether DNMT1
may mediate the HPV-16 E6 effect on miR-23b through
DNA methylation is to be examined. By quantitative
RT-PCR analysis, a 2-fold increase in the expression of
miR-23b was observed in SiHa cells treated with DNA
demethylating agent, 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine (ADC),
indicating the likely involvement of DNA methylation in
the regulation of miR-23b (Figure 1D).
By then, the upstream sequence of miR-23b
spanning from 1kb upstream to the mature miR-23b
was analyzed for the presence of any CG rich region,
where presumably DNA methylation may occur. Using
the conventional online algorithms for CpG island
prediction, such as Methprimer, no typical CpG island
(200 nucleotides or more with CG content greater than
50%) was detected. Despite the failure in the prediction of
putative CpG island in the miR-23b upstream sequence,
the possibility of the sequence being methylated was
still examined by the methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
analysis. No significant difference was however detected
between the ADC-treated cells and the untreated cells
or the HPV-16 E6 knockdown cells and the pSilencer
transfected control cells (Supplementary Figure 1).
Also, when SiHa cells were transfected with the luciferase
reporter containing the miR-23b upstream sequence,
the reporter activities in cells with or without the ADC
treatment were found to be similar. All the results
suggested the lack of CG rich region in the upstream
sequence of miR-23b and the unlikely involvement of this
sequence in the DNA methylation regulation of miR-23b.

RESULTS
Reduced miR-23b expression in DNMT
knockout cells
miR-23b is suggested to be epigenetically regulated
in the previous study. miR-23b together with a number of
miRs were found to be overexpressed in human colorectal
carcinoma HCT116 double DNMT1 and DNMT3b
knockout (DK) cells as compared to the HCT116 parental
cells [21]. It is therefore believed that these miRs may
be regulated epigenetically. miR-23b was confirmed to
be overexpressed in DK cells by quantitative RT-PCR
analysis in the present study (Figure 1A). In addition,
similar to DK cells, the miR was also overexpressed in
DNMT1 knockout (D1) cells (Figure 1A), suggesting
that DNMT1 may suppress the expression of miR-23b,
presumably by methylation, in cells.

HPV-16 E6 was previously found to upregulate

methylation to regulate the expression of miR-23b. To

regulated with their host genes [23–25]. Thus, HPV-16
E6 may regulate miR-23b, an intronic miRNA, indirectly
through the methylation of its host gene rather than
directly the miRNA’s upstream sequence. To test this
hypothesis, the effects of HPV-16 E6 and ADC on the
expression of the host gene C9orf3 were first determined.
Knockdown of HPV-16 E6 by HPV-16 E6 siRNA resulted
in an increase while full-length E6 cDNA transfection led
to a decrease in the expression of C9orf3 mRNA in SiHa
cells (Figure 2A).
On the other hand, ADC treatment increased the
expression of C9orf3 mRNA (Figure 2B) as well as the
activity of the reporter containing the C9orf3 upstream
sequence in SiHa cells. Furthermore, in HCT116 DK
and D1 cells, the level of C9orf3 mRNA was elevated

as compared with the parental cells (Figure 2C). The
results therefore suggested that HPV-16 E6 may probably
epigenetically regulate C9orf3 and thus miR-23b by
DNMTs.

HPV-16 E6 induced methylation of C9orf3
promoter through DNMT1
To elucidate the role of HPV-16 E6 in DNA
methylation regulation of C9orf3, HPV-16 E6 was
overexpressed in HCT116 parental and DK cells. Similar
to that observed for miR-23b (Figure 1B), HPV-16 E6
suppressed C9orf3 mRNA in the parental cells but not in
the DK cells (Figure 3A). On the other hand, transfection
with HPV-16 E6 siRNA increased the level of C9orf3

mRNA while co-transfection with DNMT1 cDNA offset
such increase in SiHa cells (Figure 3B). These indicated
that HPV-16 E6 controlled the expression of C9orf3 in the
same manner as that of miR-23b.
Using online CpG island prediction algorithms,
a putative CpG island was identified in the region 1 kb
upstream from the transcription start site of C9orf3
mRNA. MSP and bisulfite sequencing analyses were
therefore performed to validate the functional roles of
HPV-16 E6 and DNMT1 in the methylation of this C9orf3
upstream sequence. By MSP analysis, hypomethylation
in the C9orf3 upstream sequence was found in SiHa
cells after the treatment with ADC as well as HPV-16 E6
knockdown (Figure 4A to 4D). Furthermore, the level of
hypomethylation after HPV-16 E6 knokdown was reduced

with the over-expression of DNMT1. (Figure 4C and 4D)
The MSP results were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing
analysis. The methylation of selected CpG islands was
less in SiHa cells after HPV-16 E6 knockdown but was
partly restored by DNMT1 overexpression (Figure 4E).
This verified that HPV-16 E6 induced the methylation of
the C9orf3 promoter through DNMT1.

Induction of C9orf3 promoter methylation
suppressed miR-23b expression
The level of mature miRNA may be affected by
the processing of miRNA from the host gene. Therefore,

expression, the role of miRNA processing should also be
examined. Drosha is a RNase III that plays an initiative
role in miRNA processing. Silencing of Drosha by
Drosha-specific siRNA led to a nearly 50% reduction in
the expression of miR-23b in SiHa cells, whereas C9orf3
mRNA expression was slightly increased (Figure 5A).
This indicated the role of Drosha in the processing of
host gene C9orf3 into miR-23b. The ADC treatment
upregulated both miR-23b and C9orf3 mRNA in SiHa
cells and both effects appeared to be unchanged even
with Drosha silencing (Figure 5A). The ratio between
the relative expression of miR-23b or C9orf3 mRNA
in Drosha and control siRNA transfected cells was not
affected by the ADC treatment (Figure 5A and 5B). Taken
together, the results supported the idea that HPV-16 E6

may suppress the expression of miR-23b through the
methylation of C9orf3 promoter.

c-MET as a gene target of miR-23b
c-MET, also known as hepatocyte growth factor
receptor (HGFR), is a protooncogene reported to be overexpressed in uterine cervical cancer [19]. Notably, it was
found to be a gene target of miR-23b [26]. To verify this
relationship in human cervical carcinoma cells, c-MET
mRNA and protein levels were assessed in SiHa cells
with miR-23b precursor vector or anti-miR-23b inhibitor
transfection [27]. By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the
c-MET mRNA was decreased to 34.8% or increased
to 146.4% of the control in SiHa cells transfected with

miR-23b precursor vector or anti-miR-23b inhibitor
respectively (Figure 6A). The interaction between miR23b and c-MET mRNA was further investigated by dualluciferase reporter assay. SiHa cells were transfected with
the reporter construct containing the 3’-UTR of c-MET
mRNA [26] together with either miR-23b precursor vector
or anti-miR-23b inhibitor. The precursor vector suppressed
the reporter activity by 29.7% and the inhibitor raised that
by 71.5% (Figure 6B). Therefore, c-MET is confirmed to
be the gene target of miR-23b in SiHa cells.

that HPV-16 E6 may repress the expression of c-MET
through DNMT1 and miR-23b. To prove that, SiHa cells
were transfected with HPV-16 E6 siRNA alone or cotransfected together with either DNMT1 cDNA or antimiR-23b inhibitor. The expression of c-MET mRNA
was reduced to 26.5% of the control with only HPV-16
E6 siRNA transfection but 64.4% or 54.0% when cotransfected with DNMT1 cDNA or anti-miR-23b inhibitor
respectively (Figure 7). This supported a link from HPV16 E6, DNMT1, miR-23b to c-MET.

HPV-16 E6 downregulated c-MET through
DNMT1 and miR-23b

HPV-16 E6 silencing promoted apoptosis in SiHa
cells through miR-23b and c-MET

Since HPV-16 E6 downregulated miR-23b through
methylation of its host gene C9orf3 and c-MET was
identified as a target of miR-23b, it was hypothesized

Knockdown of HPV-16 E6 was reported to induce
apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma cells [28, 29] and
the effect was observed in SiHa cells (Figure 8A). To see

if HPV-16 E6 may act through miR-23b and c-MET in
regulation of apoptosis, the roles of c-MET and miR-23b
in apoptotic induction during cervical cancer development
were investigated. Knockdown of c-MET by c-MET
siRNA resulted in an 18% increase in apoptosis in SiHa
cells. Similarly, overexpression of miR-23b led to an 8%
increase in apoptosis in SiHa cells. (Figure 8A)
In addition, upon co-transfection together with antimiR-23b inhibitor, the apoptosis in SiHa cells with HPV16 E6 siRNA transfection was decreased from 25% to 11%
(Figure 8B). In the case of c-MET siRNA transfection, the
apoptosis was decreased from 18% to 11% (Figure 8C).
This suggested the counteracting action between miR-23b
and c-MET in apoptotic induction. This demonstrated that
miR-23b and c-MET might mediate the effect of HPV-16
E6 on apoptotic regulation in SiHa cells.
As the receptor of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
c-MET was believed to regulate apoptosis through the
Akt signaling pathway [18]. Phosphorylation of c-MET
and Akt subsequently inhibits the activity of proapoptotic
Bad by Serine-136 phosphorylation [30, 31]. Transfection
with c-MET siRNA resulted in the dephosphorylation of
c-MET and Akt in SiHa cells. This in turn deactivated the

proapoptotic Bad through dephosphorylation and may
lead to apoptotic induction. The c-MET/Akt deactivation
cascade (Figure 9) was also demonstrated in SiHa cells
transfected with miR-23b precursor vector or HPV-16
E6 siRNA, indicating HPV-16 E6 silencing promoted
apoptosis through the miR-23b-mediated c-MET/Akt
deactivation pathway.

DISCUSSION
HPV-16 E6 regulated miR-23b through DNMT1
Cancer cells generally exhibit a lower miRNA
expression level compared to normal cells [21]. These
miRNAs probably demonstrated a tumor suppressive
function and could be regulated by DNA methylation.
Oncogenic protein E6 of HPV-16 upregulated DNMT1
through the repression of tumor suppressor p53 [22].
This indicated that HPV-16 E6 may likely be responsible
for the aberrant methylation in cervical cancer. Besides,
HPV-16 E6 was reported to be involved in the miRNA
deregulation during cervical cancer development [32, 33].
Amongst, miR-23b was one of the miRNAs suppressed by

HPV-16 E6 in SiHa cells [27]. Thus, it was hypothesized
that miR-23b might be regulated by HPV-16 E6 through
DNMT1. This was confirmed as: (i) the miR-23b
expression was decreased in SiHa cells treated with DNA
methyltransferases inhibitor, 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(ADC) (Figure 1D); (ii) HPV-16 E6 lacked the ability
to suppress miR-23b expression in HCT116 DK cells
(Figure 1B); and (iii) DNMT1 overexpression in SiHa
cells counteracted the effect of HPV-16 E6 knockdown on
miR-23b expression (Figure 1C).

present study, miR-23b, however, is not embedded in any
typical CpG island. On the other hand, a CG rich region
was previously predicted in the promoter of its host gene
C9orf3 [36]. Also, a putative CpG island located within 1
kb upstream to the transcription start site of C9orf3 mRNA
was predicted by online prediction algorithm MethPrimer
and later on was verified by both methylation-specific
PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing analyses. Thus,
HPV-16 E6 was believed to regulate miR-23b through the
methylation of its host gene C9orf3 as intronic miRNAs
may be transcribed as part of the host genes [5, 37, 38]. It
is supported as miR-23b responded to epigenetic silencing
in the same way as C9orf3 mRNA, for examples, the
effect of HPV-16 E6 in HCT116 DK cells (Figure 1B and
3A) and the effect of ADC treatment (Figure 1D and 2B),
even though typical CpG island was not detected in the
upstream sequence of miR-23b. Most importantly, HPV-

Some of the epigenetically regulated intronic
miRNAs are embedded in CpG islands, such as miR-1-1

expression in human cervical cancer cells was therefore
examined. The expressions of miR-23b and C9orf3
mRNA in the ADC-treated p53 knockdown SiHa cells
were found to be higher than those in the ADC-untreated
p53 knockdown cells (Supplementary Figure 3). This
indicated the presence of the epigenetic regulation of
miR-23b through its host gene in the cervical cancer
development. However, further investigation is required
for determining the dominance of each pathway.
To sum up, this study introduces another possible
unique regulatory mechanism for miR-23b, which
appears to be another major pathway during cervical
carcinogenesis. Knockdown of oncogenic HPV-16 E6
protein reduces DNMT1 and thus increases miR-23b
expression through hypomethylation of the host gene
C9orf3. This in turn decreases the expression of c-MET
and deactivates the subsequent signaling pathway to
induce apoptosis in human cervical cancer cells. The
results suggest that targeting miR-23b may be effective in
curing cervical cancer.

HPV-16 E6 silencing induced apoptosis through
miR-23b and c-MET downstream signaling
pathway
The protooncogene c-MET is a potential therapeutic
target for cancers [39]. It is often overexpressed
and mutated in various human solid tumors [17, 40,
41], including cervical carcinomas [19], while its
overexpression was thought to be associated with the
infection of oncogenic HPVs [42]. Recent studies showed
that c-MET was the gene target of different methylationregulated miRNAs, for examples, miR-1-1 [34] and miR199a* [43]. Similar to previously reported, c-MET was
identified as a target of miR-23b in the present study,
which is also methylation-regulated. The c-MET mRNA
level was suppressed by miR-23b presumably by direct
interaction between the miR and the 3’UTR of c-MET
mRNA (Figure 6). In addition, the counteraction between
HPV-16 E6 siRNA and miR-23b inhibitor on c-MET
mRNA expression further verified the regulatory pathway
from HPV-16 E6 to miR-23b/c-MET (Figure 7).
As a result, HPV-16 E6 may act through miR-23b
and then c-MET to regulate apoptosis in human cervical
cancer cells as: (i) silencing of c-MET was shown to
induce apoptosis in SiHa cells (Figure 8A); (ii) miR-23b,
the negative regulator of c-MET, also triggered apoptotic
induction (Figure 8A); (iii) the anti-miR-23b inhibitor
reduced the apoptosis induced by knockdown of either
c-MET or HPV-16 E6 (Figure 8B). c-MET was shown to
activate diverse intracellular signaling pathways [44]. One
of the major effectors downstream of c-MET is Akt [43].
Akt is responsible for the promotion of survival through
the phosphorylation of Bad, thereby preventing cell death
[45]. Reduced levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-Bad
were demonstrated in SiHa cells transfected with HPV16 E6 siRNA, miR-23b precursor vector or c-MET
siRNA, indicating the increased susceptibility of cells to
apoptotic cell death (Figure 9). In addition, transfection
with HPV-16 E6 siRNA, miR-23b precursor vector or
c-MET siRNA also reduces cell proliferation of SiHa
cells (Supplementary Figure 2), which is also known to
be regulated by c-MET.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Human cervical carcinoma SiHa cells, human
colorectal carcinoma HCT116 parental cells (P), DNMT1
gene knockout HCT116 cells (D1) and double DNMT1
and DNMT3b genes knockout HCT116 cells (DK) were
cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine (Invitrogen, CA, USA). All cells were
incubated in humidified incubator with 10% CO2 at 37°C.

Construction of HPV-16 E6 siRNA and fulllength HPV-16 E6 cDNA expression vectors
The construction of HPV-16 E6 siRNA and fulllength HPV-16 E6 cDNA expression vectors were
performed as previously described [27]. All plasmids
were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) for 24 h.

Treatment with DNA demethylating agent
Cells were treated with 5 μM DNA demethylating
agent, 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine (ADC; Calbiochem) for 24
h either before sample extraction or 24 h after transfection.

p53 regulated miR-23b both transcriptionally
and epigenetically
Epigenetic regulation of miR-23b by DNMT1
through its host gene C9orf3 was shown in the present
study. Also, the critical role of HPV-16 E6 in the
transcriptional regulation of DNMT1 and miR-23b
through direct interaction of tumor suppressor p53 acting
on their promoters were previously reported [22, 27]. The

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIreagent
(Molecular Research Centre, OH, USA). For mRNA
expression analysis, first strand cDNA synthesis was
performed using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega,
12169

Oncotarget

WI, USA) with oligo dT primer (Invitrogen). For
miRNA expression analysis, cDNA conversion was
done by using QuantiMir RT kit (System Biosciences,
CA, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
using 1X SYBR green PCR master mix in ABI 7500
Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA). For mRNA expression analysis, the primers were
5’-TGCAAAGCTGCCAGTGAAGT-3’ (Forward) and
5’-GCCAAAGGACCACACATCTGA-3’ (Reverse) for
c-MET [46] and 5’-CCCTGCCGCTTCCAGAATGCTT-3’
(Forward) and 5’-AAGGAGGGATCAGCCGCAGAAG-3’
(Reverse) for C9orf3. For miR-23b, the mature sequence
of miR-23b was used as the forward primer and the 3’
universal reverse primer was provided by the QuantiMir
RT kit. Real-time PCR analysis with primers specific
for β-actin and human U6 RNA were also performed as
internal control for mRNAs and miR-23b respectively.
Relative standard curve (2-ΔΔCt) method was used to
determine the relative mRNA and miRNA expressions of
miR-23b.

CCTATAAATATTCTTC-3’ (Reverse). The construct was
designated as pMIR-REPORT/cMET3’UTR.

Western blot analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted using DNAzol reagent
and denatured by 0.2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 50°C
for 10 min. Samples (1 μg) were incubated under mineral
oil with freshly prepared 10 mM hydroquinone and 3 M
sodium bisulfite (pH 5) at 50°C for 16 h. Modified DNA
was then purified and desulfonated with 0.3 M NaOH,
followed by ethanol precipitation and water elution. MSP
was then carried out using methylation-specific primers
(Forward: 5’-TTTGAGTAGTTGGGATTATAGGTGT-3’
and reverse: 5’-ACTTTAAAAAACCAAAACAAAC
AAA-3’) or unmethylation-specific primers (Forward:
5’-TTTCGAGTAGTTGGGATTATAGGC-3’ and reverse:
5’-CTTTAAAAAACCGAAACAAACGA-3’)
for
amplifying methylated and unmethylated CpG islands in
the C9orf3 promoter region respectively. The PCR was
started at 95°C for 5 min, then 15 touchdown cycles (30 s
at 95°C, 45 s at 66.5°C with 0.5°C decrease each cycle and
60 s at 72°C), and 35 cycles with annealing temperature
at 59°C, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 min.
PCR products were then resolved in 2% agarose gel.
The band intensity was analyzed by ImageJ software
(version1.41o). The percentage of C9orf3 promoter
methylation was calculated as M x 100% / (U+M). U:
band intensity of the methylated PCR products; M: band
intensity of methylated PCR products.

Luciferase reporter assay
The cells were seeded in a 24-well plate for 24 h
and then transfected with the c-MET 3’-UTR reporter
constructs together with miR-23b precursor vector or
anti-miR-23b inhibitor for 24 h. At the same time, control
vector containing the Renilla luciferase pRL-CMV
was also included in the transfection for monitoring the
transfection efficiency. The firefly luciferase activity was
measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega).
Relative luciferase activity was first normalized with
Renilla luciferase activity and then compared with those
of the respective control.

Bisulfite modification and methylation-specific
PCR (MSP) analysis of C9orf3 promoter region

Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [27]. Primary antibodies against MET
(L41G3), phosphor-MET (Tyr1234/1235), Akt (pan)
(11E7), phosphor-Akt (Ser473), phosphor-Bad (Ser136)
(Cell singling, MA, USA), Bad (C-20) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA) and β-actin (Sigma, MO, USA)
were used.

Ectopic miR-23b expression and inhibition
The upregulation or downregulation of miR-23b
expression in cells was performed as previously described
[27]. In each experiment, empty vector control or anti-miR
negative control (Ambion) were also used in parallel.
