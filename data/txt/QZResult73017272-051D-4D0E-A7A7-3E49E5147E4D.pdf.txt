ABSTRACT
Inheritance of a gene mutation leads to the initiation of 5 to 10% of most cancers,
including colon cancer cases. We developed a chemoprevention strategy using a
novel combination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) sulindac plus the
anthelminthic benzimidazole, mebendazole. This oral drug combination was effective
in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Treatment with
35 mg/kg daily mebendazole reduced the number of intestinal adenomas by 56%
(P = 0.0002), 160 ppm sulindac by 74% (P < 0.0001), and the combination by 90%
(P < 0.0001). The combination significantly reduced microadenomas, polyp number
and size in both the small intestines and colon when compared to untreated controls
or sulindac alone. Mebendazole as a single agent decreased COX2 expression, blood
vessel formation, VEGFR2 phosphorylation, and worked synergistically with sulindac
to reduce overexpression of MYC, BCL2, and various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Given
the low toxicity of mebendazole, these preclinical findings support the consideration
of clinical trials for high risk cancer patients using mebendazole either alone or in
combination. The findings have implications for populations with moderate and above
risk for developing cancer.

An animal model for FAP is the C57BL6 ApcMin/+
mouse, which carries a mutation in the murine APC gene.
The ApcMin/+ mouse has a similar phenotype to FAP, with
multiple intestinal adenomas [4]. It is frequently used for
preclinical testing of cancer preventative agents.
The APC tumor suppressor is the initiating mutation
for most cases of colon cancer progression [5]. It functions
to determine intestinal cell fate via negative regulation
of the β-Catenin/Wnt pathway [6]. Approximately 1%
of CRCs are a result of an inherited APC mutation and
nearly all sporadic CRCs are initiated by APC or β-catenin
mutations [2, 7]. Inactivation of APC results in activation
of MYC and CCND1 (cyclin D1) expression promoting
aberrant crypt foci and subsequent microadenoma
formation [6, 8, 9].
A risk factor and initiating mechanism for CRC is
chronic inflammation of the colon epithelium. Deregulated

INTRODUCTION
Individuals at high risk for cancer, for example those
with a germline cancer causing mutation, have limited
options to reduce cancer risk. Hereditary cancers represent
a significant fraction of cancers. For colorectal cancer
(CRC) about 5 to 10% of cases are Mendelian inherited [1].
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is an
autosomal dominant inherited form of colon cancer caused
by germline mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) tumor suppressor gene which is characterized, by
hundreds of thousands of polyps in the gastrointestinal
tract [2]. In FAP patients, benign polyps develop early in
the teen years and one or more will transform to colorectal
cancer by age 40, if left untreated [3]. Prophylactic
colectomy reduces mortality in FAP patients, but not
completely and has an associated morbidity.

Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 (PTGS2, aka
COX2) and increased levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
serve as mediators of inflammation and tumorigenesis
[10].
These
promote
β-catenin/TCF4-mediated
transcription and upregulation of the anti-apoptosis protein
BCL2 [11].
Inflammatory cell infiltration and increased proinflammatory cytokines further drive tumor formation
and progression [10]. Intestinal polyp formation in the
ApcMin/+ mouse coincides with increased pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as TNF, IL1B, IL6, and CCL2 (MCP-1),
likely driven by constitutively activated NFKB1 [12].
The VEGF/VEGFR2 pathways are also activated
during colon tumor progression [10, 14]. VEGF activation
contributes to the inflammatory process and promotes
angiogenesis [15]. Complex interconnected pathways such
as chronic inflammation and sustained angiogenesis work
in concert to drive formation and progression of CRC.
Due to redundancy of the processes driving tumor
formation, inhibition of multiple targets could be more
effective than single targets. Safe and effective drug
combinations (and lifestyle changes) that can better
decrease inflammation and possibly angiogenesis and/or
apoptosis are a potential means to reduce cancer incidence
in high risk individuals.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
such as sulindac, represent an effective class of compounds
for the prevention of colon cancer [16, 17], and a logical
starting point for more effective chemo-preventative drug
combinations. Preclinical and clinical studies support
sulindac’s ability to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis
via both COX2 dependent and independent mechanisms
[16, 18]. However, use of sulindac for chemoprevention
is tempered by a risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and
adverse cardiovascular events [17]. Sulindac unfortunately
shows no benefit in recurrent colorectal cancer, and
resistance to sulindac’s benefit has been documented in
FAP patients [19]. Lower doses of sulindac, combined
with a safe and effective agent with a complementary
mode of action, has been suggested for colon cancer
chemoprevention in high risk patients [20].
Mebendazole (MBZ) is an FDA approved
anthelmintic benzimidazole that has shown preclinical
anti-cancer activity in a variety of malignancies including
colorectal cancer [21, 22], likely through a combination
of molecular mechanisms that include tubulin disruption
and VEGFR2-mediated anti-angiogenesis [23, 24].
Preclinical investigations have suggested mebendazole
might be useful for treatment of colon, brain, lung, and
other cancers [21, 23–28]. Case reports of mebendazole
repurposing for colorectal and other cancers have been
reported and clinical trials repurposing mebendazole for
cancer therapy are currently underway [22, 29].
Given mebendazole’s safety and lack of toxicity
in adult and pediatric patients, multiple anticancer
mechanisms and possible effectiveness as a cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy, we hypothesize that mebendazole could be
repurposed as a chemoprevention drug for patients
at high risk for developing cancer. Since the ApcMin/+
mouse has the most reported data as a colorectal cancer
chemoprevention model [30], we chose this model to
test mebendazole’s ability for chemoprevention. In this
study, we confirmed that mebendazole can slow colon
cancer xenograft growth when used therapeutically.
More importantly, we reveal in this study that
mebendazole has the ability to reduce tumor initiation
and this effect is most potent in combination with
sulindac to inhibit polyp formation in the intestines
of the ApcMin/+ mouse via mechanisms that include
inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammation.

RESULTS
MBZ suppresses tumor growth in CRC cell lines
and xenografts
The MBZ half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) for DLD-1, HCT-116, HT29 and SW480 were
0.28 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.20 μM, and 0.81 μM respectively,
similar to previous data [21]. Flank xenografts of HT29
and SW480 were used to assess MBZ efficacy (Figure
1A-1D). In the HT29 flanks, the MBZ treated tumors
were 62% smaller by volume (1759 mm3 vs. 675 mm3, P
= 0.0419) and 65% smaller by weight (1.28 g vs. 0.45 g,
P=0.0131) compared to control. In the SW480 flanks, the
MBZ treated tumors were 67% smaller by volume (1389
mm3 vs 452 mm3, P = 0.0119) and 59% smaller by weight
(0.80 g vs. 0.33 g, P = 0.0182) compared to control.
Paraffin-embedded flank tissue sections (n=3 tumors per
treatment group) were stained with Ki67 and the average
percentage of positively stained nuclei were calculated
from five randomly selected fields (20X) per tumor.
Expression of Ki67 was significantly lower in the MBZ
treated tissue versus untreated tissue in both xenografts
(HT29 P = 0.0011, SW480 P = 0.0356) (Figure 1E and
1F). This work and previously published data strongly
indicates that MBZ inhibits colon cancer cells [21]. We
next investigated a more novel hypothesis, if MBZ would
work as a chemopreventative.

MBZ treatment reduces intestinal tumorigenesis
in the ApcMin/+ mouse
Oral mebendazole prevented tumor formation in the
intestine of ApcMin/+ mice and the best chemoprevention
occurred when MBZ was combined with sulindac (Figure
2A). Compared with the total number of tumors in the
intestine of untreated ApcMin/+ mice (62.5 ± 7.50), 35 mg/
kg MBZ continuous dose administered in the feed for
9 weeks significantly reduced the number of tumors by
56% (27.25 ± 2.68, P = 0.0002) as a single agent. We
also administered MBZ at 50 mg/kg five days per week

for 9 weeks via oral gavage to mimic the dosing regimen
successfully used in brain tumor chemotherapy [23],
but found that this treatment schedule did not produce a
significant outcome (P = 0.1588) and there was a high
degree of variability in the final tumor counts (42.86 ±
11.88). Sulindac alone at a dose of 160 ppm in the drinking
water for 11 weeks inhibited polyp formation by 74% (16

± 1.57, P < 0.0001) as expected based on previous reports
[18, 30, 31]. However, the combination of sulindac plus
MBZ produced an even greater chemoprotective effect,
reducing polyp number by 80% (12.25 ± 0.95, P=0.002)
when 50 mg/kg MBZ gavage was used and by 90% (6.58
± 0.73, P < 0.0001) when 35 mg/kg MBZ in feed was
used. These results indicate that MBZ is chemoprotective

MBZ and MBZ plus sulindac inhibit tumor
formation in each intestinal segment

as a single agent and works synergistically with sulindac.
The addition of MBZ to sulindac reduced tumor formation
compared to the current standard of care of sulindac
alone (P<0.0001). A summary of total polyp counts and
distribution for the entire study can be found in Table
1. Macrodissection of intact intestinal tissue allowed us
to quantify polyp number and size and compare tumor
burden between treatment groups, with representative
pictures shown in Figure 2B.

We observed that MBZ is most effective in the ApcMin/+
model when administered at 35 mg/kg daily continuous oral
dose in the feed, a reasonable dosing regimen for long term
chemoprevention. The average distribution of polyps in the
small intestine of the untreated control ApcMin/+ mice (Figure
3A) was: proximal (15.50 ± 2.28), middle (28.83 ± 3.74),
distal (16.92 ± 2.37). In the proximal small intestine, there

ApcMin/+ mutation were weaned onto a high fat diet at 3 weeks of age and randomized into treatment groups. Sulindac was provided in
buffered drinking water (0.16g/L) starting at 3 weeks of age. MBZ treatment was initiated at 5 weeks of age and was provided in a high-fat
custom feed at 35 mg/kg seven days a week or administered by oral gavage at 50 mg/kg five days per week. At 100 days of age, the small
intestines and colon of ApcMin/+ mice were analyzed and the total number of polyps/mouse were averaged and compared across treatment
groups. B. Representative tissue from middle and distal small intestines are shown to compare polyp burden in untreated control, 35 mg/kg

was a 70% (4.58 ± 0.65, P = 0.0001) reduction in polyps
with MBZ and a 69% (4.77 ± 0.68, P=0.0001) reduction
using sulindac compared to control. In the middle segment
of the small intestine, there was a 57% (12.42 ± 1.22,
P=0.0004) reduction in polyps with MBZ and a 79% (6.08
± 0.94, P<0.0001) reduction with sulindac compared to
control. In the distal small intestine, polyps were reduced
by 42% (9.83 ± 1.40, P=0.0174) with MBZ and by 79%
(3.62 ± 0.53, P<0.0001) with sulindac compared to control.
The combination of sulindac + MBZ had the most potent
inhibitory effect in the small intestine by reducing polyp

92% in middle (2.42 ± 0.37, P<0.0001), 92% in distal (1.37
± 0.30, P<0.0001) compared to control. The combination
of the two drugs significantly outperformed single agent
therapy in every segment.
MBZ alone was also compared to SUL alone (not
shown), with SUL overall being more effective than MBZ
(p = 0.0012). However this was due to the relative efficacy
of SUL in the small intestines and the larger number of
polys in the small versus the large intestines in this model.

1.25). A similar increase in colon polyps due to sulindac
has been observed by multiple researchers using the
ApcMin/+ mouse [32]. Our results show that MBZ alone
decreased tumor burden by 66% (0.42 ± 0.19, P=0.0397)
and mitigated tumorigenic effects of sulindac leading to
a decrease of 70% (0.37 ± 0.14, P=0.0083) in the MBZ +
sulindac combination treatment group, as seen in Figure
3A. The colon is the primary site of polyp formation in
human FAP patients, and it would of course be favorable
to have a therapy that is more effective in the colon.

Sulindac plus MBZ eliminates larger polyps and
microadenomas
Table 1 summarizes the average number of polyps
in each treatment group that fall within a particular size
range. 35 mg/kg MBZ reduced the number of larger polyps
compared to control. As with polyp multiplicity, we saw a
combination effect between the two drugs to significantly
suppress the formation of visible adenomas. The four panels
in Figure 3B allow an up close comparison of sulindac as
a single agent versus MBZ + sulindac in each segment of
the intestine. Combination treatment resulted in significant
reduction in the smallest polyps (<1 mm) in all intestinal
segments and significant reduction in the 1-2 mm polyps
in the middle, distal, and colon when compared to sulindac
treatment alone. MBZ + sulindac combination therapy
resulted in a total elimination of all polyps over 2 mm in
the middle small intestine and colon. H&E stained intestinal
segments from each treatment group were analyzed for
microadenoma formation by an independent, board-certified
veterinary pathologist (D.Huso). The conclusion was that

no detectable BCL2 after MBZ treatment (Figure 5C). We
then looked at expression of these proteins in control versus
treated ApcMin/+ intestinal tissue lysate. For MYC, there was
a 29% decrease with MBZ, a 22% decrease using sulindac,
and a 78% decrease using MBZ + sulindac. For BCL2,
there was a 69% decrease with MBZ alone, a 73% decrease
using sulindac alone, and a 98% decrease using the MBZ +
sulindac combination treatment (Figure 5D). ApcMin/+ mice
with a large polyp burden develop splenomegaly so, as a
result, spleen weight is a useful surrogate marker of polyp
load [33]. In our experiment, the average spleen size for the
Control group, MBZ feed, sulindac, MBZ feed + sulindac
and wild-type age matched mice were 406, 207, 126, 108,
and 70 mg, respectively. Reduction in MYC has been shown
to reverse splenomegaly in ApcMin/+ mice and protect from
tumorigenesis, as seen in the mutant ApcMin/+ MYC+/- mouse
model [34]. The present data demonstrate that MBZ is
effective as a single agent and in combination with sulindac
at reducing expression of proteins that are critical for early
intestinal adenoma initiation and tumor progression.

MBZ treatment suppresses oncogenes that drive
proliferation and survival
Immunohistochemistry of HT29 flank xenograft
tissue and ApcMin/+ intestinal tissue with MYC, COX2,
and BCL2 antibodies showed that MBZ treatment had
an antitumor effect. Comparing untreated tissue versus
50 mg/kg/day MBZ for four weeks treated tissue showed
a 71% reduction in MYC and a 32% reduction in COX2
expression (Figure 5A). ApcMin/+ intestinal polyps that
received MBZ treatment at 35 mg/kg daily showed a
35% decrease in MYC expression and a 19% reduction
in COX2 expression. BCL2 expression in the intestinal
villus was reduced 88% after MBZ treatment (Figure
5B). Lysates from flank and intestinal tissue were probed
using MYC and BCL2 antibodies via western blotting. The
intensity of the bands for each group were averaged and
values were expressed as percent change for control versus
treated. In HT29, there was an 83% decrease in MYC and
no detectable BCL2 expression after MBZ treatment. In
SW480, there was a 75% decrease in MYC, and again,

endothelial cell proliferation, neovascular survival, and
vascular permeability by binding to the VEGF-receptor
2 (VEGFR2) [33]. MBZ has been previously shown to
reduce CD31-positive microvessel formation in nonsmall cell lung cancer xenografts and in orthotopically
implanted medulloblastomas [24, 35]. MBZ inhibits
the tyrosine kinase function of VEGFR2 by blocking
autophosphorylation at the Y1175 binding site [24]. We
hypothesized that inhibiting neovascularization might
be a mechanism for MBZ to suppress polyp formation
or growth. Anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) endothelial marker
was used to assess microvessel formation in flank and
intestinal ApcMin/+ tumors. There was a 63% inhibition
(P=0.0005) in microvessel density in flank tumors and

51% inhibition (P=0.0257) of microvessel density in
MBZ treated ApcMin/+ polyps versus untreated controls
(Figure 6A and 6B). ApcMin/+ tumors were dual-stained for
VEGFR2 and pVEGFR2-Y1175 and immunofluorescent
secondary antibodies were used to visualize a mild
reduction in VEGFR2 auto-phosphorylation (Figure 6C).

changes [10]. An increase in inflammatory stress has been
reported to correlate with the development of intestinal
polyposis in ApcMin/+ mice. Starting at 12 weeks of age, the
polyp burden dramatically increases along with levels of
cytokines IL6, TNF, IL1B, and CCL2 [12]. Once the tumor
vasculature has been established, the stroma is infiltrated
by macrophages that drive cytokine production. Since
MBZ has the ability to prevent tumor vessel formation, we
hypothesized that it may decrease inflammatory cytokines
that can accumulate in the ApcMin/+ intestine.
To examine the effects of MBZ alone and MBZ
+ sulindac combination on various pro-inflammatory
cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors, we used a colorimetric

Mouse ELISA strip reactive to TNF, IL6, VEGF, CCL2,
IL1B, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and FGF2 (Figure 7). The relative
absorbance values were averaged for each treatment group
(n=3 mice per group) and the percent difference in values
was compared to the results of the untreated control mice. In
the small intestine, MBZ alone decreased the levels of TNF
(22%), IL6 (10%), VEGF (12%), IL1B (10%), G-CSF (5%),
GM-CSF (5%), FGF2 (8%). MBZ + Sulindac decreased
the levels of TNF (31%), IL6 (28%), VEGF (33%), CCL2
(24%), IL1B (24%), G-CSF (24%), GM-CSF (24%), and
FGF2 (28%). In most cases, the combination treatment
reduced the cytokines to values that were very similar to the
levels observed in wild type littermate controls.

DISCUSSION

What are possible mechanisms for this combination
of a NSAID and mebendazole that allow a significant
reduction of adenoma initiation and growth? Evidence
here supports a reduction of both inflammation and
neovascularization. Sulindac and other NSAIDs work
to prevent colon cancer through an inhibition of COX2
[17, 31]. We observed that mebendazole alone also
reduces COX2 in the ApcMin/+ mouse adenomas, and
even more so when combined with sulindac. Importantly,
the combination reduces inflammatory cytokines in the
intestinal epithelium more than either treatment alone,
to levels very similar to those in APC wild type mice.
Although there were scant adenomas left for analysis from
the combination treatment, the reduction of COX2, MYC,
and BCL2 in the mebendazole only tumors also points to
reduced inflammation beyond sulindac alone.
Why should mebendazole, whose best documented
mechanism is tubulin inhibition [36, 37], inhibit COX2
or inflammation? One possibility is revealed in Figure 6,
where mebendazole inhibits VEGFR2 phosphorylation
and reduces tumor vascularization (as shown by CD31
staining) in adenomas. We have shown previously
in medulloblastoma xenografts that MBZ works via
angiogenesis inhibition [24]. The molecular target for
mebendazole’s kinase inhibition is the ATP binding site
on VEGFR2, thus inhibiting its activation [24]. This offtarget effect is in addition to its tubulin binding. Whereas
it might be difficult to explain how a tubulin inhibitor can
prevent adenoma formation, inhibition of VEGF and antiangiogenesis has a more readily understood mechanism.
In addition to lack of vessel growth starving the nascent

We observed that treating ApcMin/+ mice with the
mebendazole plus sulindac combination resulted in 90%
less polyps versus untreated mice. At the microscopic
level, there was close to normal histopathology and
no microadenomas could be found in the combination
treated ApcMin/+ mice examined, suggesting that this
drug combination acts by preventing tumor initiation,
accounting for the 90% reduction. The simplest
explanation to account for the 10% adenomas remaining,
is that they are the fraction that initiated prior to the start
of therapy at 5 weeks.
The size of the remaining treated adenomas was
also reduced, consistent with mebendazole’s ability to
slow tumor growth. There was a ~50-fold reduction in the
largest (3 mm) adenomas (Table 1). In each segment of
the intestines there was a reduction in the number and size
of tumors for the combination therapy, compared to either
control or sulindac alone. Our findings were consistent
with previous publications showing that sulindac alone
is not effective in preventing colon adenoma formation
in the ApcMin/+ mouse and may promote tumorigenesis in
the colon, despite being effective in the small intestines
[32]. When comparing MBZ alone to the combination,
MBZ alone was as effective in the colon, and only in the
small intestines was the addition of sulindac helpful. In the
colon, the MBZ + sulindac combination treatment group
had a four-fold reduction of adenomas relative to sulindac
alone and a three-fold relative reduction compared to
untreated control mice.

Figure 7: The combination of MBZ plus sulindac decrease inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors in the
ApcMin/+ intestine more than either drug alone. A colorimetric Mouse ELISA strip reactive to TNF, IL6, VEGF, CCL2, IL1B, G-CSF,
GM-CSF, and FGF2 was used to measure the reduction of pro-inflammatory markers in each treatment group. The relative absorbance
values were averaged and the percent difference in values was compared to the results of the untreated control mice (n=3 mice averaged
for each treatment group).

been limited to the ApcMin/+ mouse model of FAP, the
implications of these results are broader. Many colon and
other cancer types are initiated or driven at least in part by
inflammation. Colon cancer is common and there are other
high risk populations where the benefits of this therapy
would outweigh risk.
While further mechanistic and translational
development of employing mebendazole plus NSAID
for chemoprevention are warranted, it is not too early
to consider pilot clinical studies for the FAP patient.
These patients are in immediate need of more effective
chemoprevention strategies. A clinical study of the effect
of the MBZ/NSAID combination or mebendazole alone,
as assessed by colonoscopy for patients prior to (but not
delaying) prophylactic colectomy could yield a relatively
rapid assessment of mechanism and efficacy in humans.

tumors of oxygen and nutrients, VEGF pathway inhibition
itself has an anti-inflammatory effect [15], which likely
acts at an earlier stage of tumorigenesis. This model of
combined inhibition of inflammation and angiogenesis fits
the existing data and is supported by previous mechanistic
studies [24].
The important considerations for a chemopreventative drug are safety, efficacy and lack of toxicity.
Mebendazole is relatively non-toxic with a 44-year track
record of safe use, with millions of patients who have
taken the drug. In many regions of the world mebendazole
is sold over the counter. We achieved the best results
with continuous dosing of mebendazole in the feed,
with an effective dose averaging 35 mg/kg/day. The 5
day a week oral gavage, did not work as well despite an
equivalent weekly dose, perhaps due to the interruption in
therapy. Daily oral dosing of 35 mg/kg or more is readily
achievable in humans where up to 200 mg/kg/day have
been used for years of hydatid disease therapy [38] and
have been used during a phase 1 trial for newly diagnosed
glioblastoma. We recommend a dose range of 40 to 75 mg/
kg/day of mebendazole in humans for chemoprevention,
along with monthly monitoring of blood counts and serum
chemistry including liver function enzymes.
The toxicity of NSAIDs for use in this therapy is of far
greater concern. Sulindac was chosen as a positive control
because it had the best supporting data showing efficacy in
the ApcMin/+ mouse, has been demonstrated in humans, and it
is as close to a standard of care for FAP patients as possible
[39]. However, unlike mebendazole, its potential cardiac
side effects or bowl perforations can be lethal. We noted in
our study that the combination of MBZ + sulindac reduced
sulindac’s toxicity, with no weight loss and other side effects
compared to sulindac alone. Despite this positive effect of
mebendazole to both increase efficacy and reduce apparent
toxicity of sulindac, it will be prudent to investigate other
NSAID/mebendazole combinations or even consider the use
of mebendazole alone for colon adenoma prevention given
it’s favorable efficacy to toxicity ratio.
We do not think other anti-parasitic benzimidazoles
will work as well as mebendazole, based on our empirical
preclinical testing of most of the approved drugs in this
class. However, in this study we did employ an improved
mebendazole formulation of pure polymorph C [40].
Although we have not directly compared different
formulations of mebendazole in the ApcMin/+ mouse, the
polymorph C version of mebendazole is better absorbed
than the other polymorphs or several generic versions of
mebendazole, yielding more favorable pharmacokinetics
and better anti-tumor efficacy [40].
All versions of mebendazole can be obtained at low
cost, and over the counter in many countries. This is an
advantage to reach larger numbers of patients, in particular
in economically underprivileged populations.

of the combination of mebendazole plus NSAID has

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inhibition of CRC cell lines and xenografts with
Mebendazole
Growth inhibition of MBZ on DLD-1, HCT-116,
HT29 and SW480 colon cancer cell lines was measured
by CCK-8 cell viability (Dijindo), as previously
described [23]. HT29 and SW480 were each implanted
subcutaneously into the flank of Athymic Nude mice,
with growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Sciences, San
Jose, CA). After 5 days the mice were randomized into
control and 50 mg/kg MBZ gavage treatment groups,
n=5 mice per group. Mebendazole polymorph C tablets
were crushed and mixed with 1:1 PBS/sesame oil and
administered by oral gavage 5 days per week as previously
described [23]. Tumor measurements were taken 2x per
week with a digital calipers for 4 weeks of treatment.

ApcMin/+ mouse chemoprevention study
Heterozygous male C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J mice and
wild-type female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME) were bred. The presence of the ApcMin/+
mutation was confirmed in the tail snips of affected mice
by Transnetyx, Inc (Cordova, TN). Affected pups were
weaned at 21 days of age onto a mouse diet consisting
of 45% kcal% fat (D12451, Research Diets), containing
soybean oil and lard for fat. The mice were randomized
into these groups: untreated control (n=12), 50 mg/
kg MBZ gavage (n=7), 35 mg/kg MBZ in feed (n=12),
160 ppm sulindac (n=13), 50 mg/kg MBZ gavage + 160
ppm sulindac (n=5) or 35 mg/kg MBZ in feed + 160 ppm
sulindac (n=19).
At 3 weeks of age, drinking water with 160
ppm (0.5 mg/day) Sulindac (Sigma) in 4 mM sodium
phosphate buffered drinking water was supplied [18], as
previously described as an effective dose [30, 31]. MBZ
by gavage was 50 mg/kg for 5 days per week as previously

described [23], starting at 5 weeks of age. MBZ was also
administered by a custom feed of MBZ polymorph C in
the high fat mouse diet, starting at 5 weeks of age. All
animal experiments were performed under an approved
protocol and in accordance with Johns Hopkins Animal
Care and Use guidelines.
At 100 days of age, mice were euthanized and the
intestines were removed, opened and the tumors counted
with a dissecting microscope at 20x magnification in the
colon and the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the
small intestines [41]. Individual polyps were measured
with digital calipers and categorized for ≤ 1.0 mm, 1.0-2.0
mm, 2.1-3.0, and ≥ 3.0 mm in diameter. Tissue segments
were swiss-rolled and fixed in 10% formalin [42] and
scanned at 40X with a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer-XR
digital slide scanner for histology and microadenomas.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Deparaffinized tissue sections were rehydrated
and antigens were unmasked using citrate buffer and
endogenous peroxidase and biotin were blocked.
Immunohistochemical staining was on slides coated in
10% goat serum/1% BSA solution containing primary
antibodies for Ki67 (1:500), MYC (Abcam, 1:500), COX2
(Cell Signaling, 1:500), BCL2 (Santa Cruz, 1:400), CD31
(Thermo Scientific, 1:50), and incubated overnight at 4°C.
Super Sensitive Link-Label IHC biotin-conjugated/HRP
secondary antibodies (Biogenex) and DAB chromogen
substrate (Biogenex) were used for detection. Slides
were counterstained with hematoxylin scanned at 20X
using an Aperio AT2 slide scanner. For microvessel
density (MVD), tumor sections were viewed under 20X
magnification to identify microvessel “hotspots” [43] and
the average MVD was calculated from 10 fields from each
treatment group. Dual immunofluorescent visualization of
vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor 2 inhibition
was performed as previously described [23].
