ABSTRACT:
BRCA1/p220-assocaited and triple negative/basal-like (TN/BL) tumors are
aggressive and incurable breast cancer diseases that share among other features
the no/low BRCA1/p220 expression. Here we show that BRCA1/p220 silencing in
normal human mammary epithelial (HME) cells reduces expression of two RNAdestabilizing proteins, namely AUF1 and pCBP2, both proteins bind and destabilize
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in HME cells triggers expression of
several TN/BL markers, e.g., cytokeratins 5 and 17, p-cadherin, EGFR and cyclin E
as well as expression and activation of the pro-survival proteins; AKT and survivin.
BRCA1-IRIS silencing in the TN/BL cell line, SUM149 or restoration of BRCA1/p220
expression in the mutant cell line, HCC1937 reduced expression of TN/BL markers,
AKT, survivin, and induced cell death. Collectively, we propose that BRCA1/p220
loss of expression or function triggers BRCA1-IRIS overexpression through a posttranscriptional mechanism, which in turn promotes formation of aggressive and
invasive breast tumors by inducing expression of TN/BL and survival proteins.

INTRODUCTION

Transcription upregulation, enhanced mRNA
stabilization or suppression of protein degradation can
all lead to increase in gene expression [18]. The rate of
decay of certain mRNAs is regulated by the interaction
of sequence-specific trans-acting, mRNA destabilizing
proteins (reviewed in [19]), such as the poly(U)-binding
factor (aka hnRNPD/AUF1, see [20,21]) and the poly(rC)binding proteins (aka hnRNPE/pCBP1-4, see [22]) or
mRNA stabilizing proteins, such as HuR (aka ELAVL1,
see [23]) with cis-acting AU- or C-rich elements (ARE)
in the 3`-UTR of these mRNAs. In human, ~10% of
the genes mostly oncogenes are regulated by this posttranscriptional mechanism [24-27]. Not surprisingly,
several of these destabilizing proteins are downregulated
in cancers [28,29].
BRCA1-IRIS is a recently identified, 1399 residue
BRCA1/p220 locus proto-oncogene [30] made from the
first 11 exons and 34-amino acid encoded by BRCA1/
p220 intron 11 (for details see [30]). BRCA1-IRIS
overexpression inhibits geminin function, thus promoting
DNA replication [30], triggers cyclin D1 expression, thus
promoting cell proliferation [31,32] and prevents p53 and/
or p38MAPK activation or enhances AKT and survivin

Women with BRCA1/p220 mutations are predisposed
to early-onset breast cancer [1,2]. Although triple
negative/basal-like (TN/BL) are sporadic tumors, they
share many phenotypical, immunohistochemical, clinical
and molecular characteristics with BRCA1/p220-mutant
cancers [3,4]. Loss of BRCA1/p220 tumor suppression
function often leads to profound increase in genomic
instability [5,6], likely due to lack in DNA damage
repair [7], in cell-cycle checkpoints activation [8] or in
ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of proliferation (e.g.,
estrogen receptor [ER]) or survival (e.g., AKT) proteins
[9-11].
Apoptosis evasion allows further transforming
mutations to accumulate in cancer cells and increase
the possibility of disease progression and/or resistance
to therapy [12,13]. About 50% of breast cancers carry
dysfunctional p53 [14], and thus fail to arrest the cell
cycle when damaged becoming chemo-drug resistant
[14]. Similarly, ~40% of breast cancers show increase
AKT kinase activity [15] and are apoptosis and chemodrug resistant [16,17].

expression/activation, thus increases cell tolerance to cell-/
geno-toxic stimuli [33,34].
Here, we show that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression
in breast tumor cells is, at least partially, BRCA1/
p220-dependent. BRCA1/p220 silencing in HME cells
downregulated expression of the RNA destabilizing
proteins, AUF1 and pCBP2, that bind to BRCA1IRIS mRNA 3`-UTR and destabilize it. BRCA1-IRIS
overexpression in HME cells triggered expression of the
TN/BL markers, cytokeratins 5 and 17 (CK5 and 17),
p-cadherin (CDH3), EGFR and cyclin E [35] as well as
expression and activation of the survival factors, AKT
and survivin. BRCA1-IRIS silencing or BRCA1/p220
overexpression in BRCA1/p220-mutant or TN/BL cancer
cell lines reduced expression of these TN/BL markers,
AKT and survivin and induced cell death. Our data show
that BRCA1/p220 loss of expression or function generates
aggressive breast cancer cells, in part, by upregulating
BRCA1-IRIS expression, implying that chemotherapeutic
targeting of BRCA1-IRIS could be pursued for breast
cancer patients with BRCA1/p220-associated or TN/BL
diseases.

HME cell lines expressing high levels of BRCA1/p220
protein (Figure 1A) and mRNA (Figure 1B), BRCA1-IRIS
protein (Figure 1A) and mRNA (Figure 1B) levels were
significantly lower. In contrast, in sporadic or BRCA1/
p220-mutant (e.g., HCC1937), low or none BRCA1/p220expressing cell lines, respectively (see figure 1A and 1B),
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and protein expression significantly
increased (Figure 1A and 1B).

BRCA1/p220 does not affect BRCA1-IRIS protein
stability
To understand the underlying molecular mechanism
behind this inverse relationship, we considered three
mutually exclusive scenarios. BRCA1/p220 could directly
or indirectly; a) suppress BRCA1-IRIS gene transcription,
b) decrease BRCA1-IRIS mRNA stability, or c) trigger
BRCA1-IRIS protein degradation (BRCA1/p220 forms
an E3 ligase with BARD1, see [9,10]). To distinguish
between these possibilities, BRCA1/p220 or BARD1 were
silenced in HME cells for 72h (see Figure 2A, far right
panels) and cells were exposed to 10µM of cycloheximide
(protein synthesis inhibitor) during the last 24h.
The levels of BRCA1-IRIS and actin proteins were
measured using western blot on proteins isolated from
these cells using sonication. All data were normalized
to actin protein level in siLuc/no cycloheximide treated
cells, which was taken as 1 (Figure 2A, left). As
expected BRCA1-IRIS protein level decreased following
cycloheximide treatment in control-, BARD1- and
BRCA1/p220-silenced cells (Figure 2A, left). In the
absence of cycloheximide, however, BRCA1-IRIS protein
level was higher in BRCA1/p220-silenced cells, compared
to control and BARD1-silenced cells (Figure 2A, left).
Moreover, the levels of BRCA1-IRIS and GAPDH mRNAs
was measured using real-time RT/qPCR on RNAs isolated
from these cells. All data were normalized to GAPDH

RESULTS
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in BRCA1/p220
none-/low-expressing breast cancer cells
We showed earlier an inverse correlation between
BRCA1-IRIS and BRCA1/p220 expressions in breast
cancer cell lines [30]. Here, we confirmed that by
analyzing proteins and RNAs isolated from several
exponentially growing breast cancer cell lines and 2
normal HME cell lines. As expected western blot analysis
using mouse monoclonal antibodies [30,36] and real
time RT/qPCR, respectively, showed that in normal

mRNA level in siLuc/no cycloheximide treated cells,
which was taken as 1 (Figure 1A, right). BRCA1-IRIS
mRNA level increased in control and BARD1-silenced
cells following cycloheximide treatment only (Figure
1A, right), whereas in BRCA1/p220-silenced cells before
and after cycloheximide treatment (Figure 1A, right).
These data argue against an effect of BRCA1/p220 and/
or BRAD1 on the stability of BRCA1-IRIS protein. In
fact, previously we were unable to detect any interaction
between BRCA1-IRIS protein and BRCA1/p220 or

BRCA1/p220 destabilizes BRCA1-IRIS mRNA
Next, we studied whether BRCA1/p220 affects
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA stability (known to be controlled by
elements in the 3`-UTRs of mRNAs). A BRCA1-IRIS
cDNA that includes the entire 3`-UTR of BRCA1-IRIS
(see [30]) was cloned in a doxycycline (Dox) inducible

mammalian expression vector, infected in HME cells
and one uninducible (IRISa) and two inducible (IRISb
and c) clones were selected to study further (Figure 2B,
right upper panel). We reasoned that since BRCA1-IRIS
is expressed in these cells from an exogenous promoter,
they should be a good system to explore whether BRCA1/
p220 affects BRCA1-IRIS expression by a transcriptional
or post-transcriptional mechanism. Thus parental, IRISa,
b and c were grown in the absence or presence of Dox
(2µg/ml), in the presence of Dox but cells were transfected
with BRCA1-IRIS or BRCA1/p220 siRNAs. RNAs and
proteins (using sonication) were isolated at 24, 48, 72
or 168h post-siRNA transfection and the expression of
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and protein in each treatment was
measured using real time RT/PCR (Figure 2B, left) and
western blot (Figure 2C), respectively.

In the absence of Dox the 4 cell lines expressed
normal levels of BRCA1-IRIS mRNA (black lines in
Figure 2B, left) and protein (Figure 2C). Dox induced
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA (compare green to black lines in
Figure 2B, left) and protein (Figure 2C) expression in
IRISb and c and not parental or IRISa starting at 24h.
BRCA1-IRIS silencing decreased BRCA1-IRIS mRNA
(see red lines in Figure 2B, left) and protein (Figure 2C)
in all cell lines (although less pronounced in induced
IRISb and IRISc). The expression returned to pre-siRNA
transfection levels at 168h (see red lines in Figure 2B, left
and 2C). BRCA1/p220 silencing (Figure 2B, right lower
panels), however, increased BRCA1-IRIS mRNA (blue
lines in Figure 2B, left) and protein (Figure 2C) levels in
all cell lines starting at 24h. These effects also disappeared
at 168h post-siRNA transfection (blue lines in Figure 2B,

left and 2C) when the effect of BRCA1/p220 siRNA
disappeared (see Figure 2B, right lower panels).
To ascertain that these effects are dependent on
the 3`-UTR of BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and not an artifact
from the plasmid 5`-UTR (known inducer of mRNA
translation), BRCA1-IRIS + 3`-UTR cDNA was cloned
into several other mammalian expression vectors.
Transient transfection of any of the plasmids into HME
cells with BRCA1/p220 siRNA led to stabilization of the
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA (not shown). We thus concluded that
BRCA1/p220 loss stabilizes BRCA1-IRIS mRNA through
an effect on its 3`-UTR.

in MDAMB468 and SKBR3 cells starting at 24h and
thereafter (Figure 3B, right).
To directly assess the effect of AUF1 and pCBP2 on
BRCA1-IRIS expression, they and BRCA1/p220 were
separately silenced in HME cells (72h, Figure 3C, upper
panels), MCF7 or MDAMB231 (72h, Figure 3D, left).
AUF1 or pCBP2 and not HuR (control) silencing like
BRCA1/p220 silencing significantly increased the level of
BRCA1-IRIS protein in HME (Figure 3C, lower panels),
MCF7 and MDAMB231 (Figure 3D, left) cells. Moreover,
AUF1- or pCBP2-silencing increased BRCA1-IRIS mRNA
levels in MCF7 and MDAMB231 cells (shown at 25 PCR
cycle at 72h, Figure 3D, right). These data confirm that
expression of BRCA1-IRIS in normal and cancer cell
lines is, at least partially, BRCA1/p220/AUF1 and pCBP2dependent.

Identification of BRCA1/p220 induced transacting proteins that de-stabilize BRCA1-IRIS
mRNA

BRCA1/p220 effect on BRCA1-IRIS is posttranscriptional and not transcriptional

In an attempt to identify whether BRCA1/p220
has an effect on mRNA stability, we searched recently
performed gene expression microarray data comparing
BRCA1/p220-expressing to BRCA1/p220-silenced HME
cells for 3`-UTR binding and destabilizing proteins. Using
this approach we found that the expressions of the mRNA
3`-ITR binding and destabilizing proteins, AUF-1 and
pCBP2 (see introduction) were significantly decreased in
BRCA1/p220-silenced HME cells (data not shown).
To confirm that, we silenced BRCA1/p220 for 24168h in normal HME cells, MCF7 (estrogen receptorpositive, ER+) or MDAMB231 (ER-) breast cancer cell
lines (both express detectable levels of BRCA1/p220
protein, see Figure 1A and 3A, left). We also transiently
overexpressed (for 24-168h) BRCA1/p220 in two none-/
low-BRCA1/p220 expressing breast cancer cell lines,
MDAMB468 (TN/BL) and SKBR3 (Her2+) (see Figure
1A).
Compared to control treated cells, BRCA1/p220
silencing (72h) significantly reduced AUF1 and pCBP2 but
not HuR protein levels in HME, MCF7 and MDAMB231
cells, and its overexpression (48h) in MDAMB468 and
SKBR3 cells significantly enhanced AUF1 and pCBP2 but
not HuR protein levels (see Figure 3A, right). In contrast,
BRCA1/p220-silencing increased the level of BRCA1IRIS protein in HME, MCF7 and MDAMB231 to different
degrees (see Figure 3A, left), whereas its overexpression
significantly decreased BRCA1-IRIS protein expression
in MDAMB468 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 3A, right).
This was also confirmed at the mRNA level. Indeed in
real-time RT/PCR and after normalization to the level of
GAPDH mRNA in each cell line, we found that BRCA1/
p220 silencing increased BRCA1-IRIS mRNA in HME,
MCF7 and MDAMB231 cells starting at 24h (Figure
3B, left) until 72h, but returned to control levels at 168h
(Figure 3B, left). BRCA1/p220 overexpression, on the
other hand, decreased the level of BRCA1-IRIS mRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To rule out any effect of BRCA1/p220 on BRCA1IRIS gene transcription and to directly assess the effect of
BRCA1/p220, AUF1 or pCBP2 on BRCA1-IRIS mRNA
stability, BRCA1-IRIS mRNA half-life (t1/2) was analyzed
in control-, BRCA1/p220-, AUF1-, pCBP2- or HuRsilenced (72h) HME cells following exposure to the de
novo transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Act D) during
the last 10h. Total RNAs were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10h after Act D treatment and analyzed by real-time RT/
qPCR for BRCA1-IRIS and GAPDH expression.
After normalization to the level of 18S rRNA, the
none-target and stable GAPDH mRNA level remained
unchanged following all siRNA transfections (Figure 3E).
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA t1/2, on the other hand, was 2.5-3h in
control and HuR-silenced cells (Figure 3F), increased to
>10h in BRCA1/p220-silenced (Figure 3F) and to >6h
in AUF1- or pCBP2-silenced HME cells (Figure 3F).
These data demonstrate that BRCA1/p220 does not affect
BRCA1-IRIS gene transcription, but instead destabilizes
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA.

Identification of destabilizing cis-acting elements
in BRCA1-IRIS mRNA 3`-UTR
Indeed, in silico search of BRCA1-IRIS 3`-UTR
showed the presence of several cis-acting putative ARE
consensus binding elements for AUF1 (class II AU rich
binding motifs, see red in Figure 4A) and for pCBP2
(C-rich binding motifs, see green in Figure 4A), suggesting
that the 3`-UTR destabilizes BRCA1-IRIS mRNA, in vivo.
To experimentally confirm that, the entire BRCA1-IRIS
3`-UTR was cloned downstream of the luciferase coding
region in the RSV-Luc plasmid (see atop of Figure 4B).
The 3`-UTR of c-fos (known ARE containing) was also
304

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 299-313

cloned downstream of the luciferase coding region in the
same plasmid to be used as positive control. Backbone
plasmid transfection in HME cells produced high-level
basal luciferase expression (Figure 4B). Introducing
BRCA1-IRIS or c-fos 3`-UTR downstream of the luciferase
gene in this plasmid abolished that expression when cotransfected in HME cells with siGFP and siHuR (negative
controls, Figure 4B), but not when co-transfected with
BRCA1/p220, AUF1 or pCBP2 siRNA (Figure 4B).
Taken together these data suggest that like c-fos 3`-UTR,
BRCA1-IRIS 3`-UTR carry AUF1 and pCBP2 binding and
mRNA destabilizing motif(s).

To measure endogenous association between these
trans-acting factors and the cis-acting elements in BRCA1IRIS 3`-UTR, cytoplasmic proteins (polysomes) were
collected 72h after control- or BRCA1/p220-silencing in
HME cells in conditions that maintain RNA stability and
were processed for immunoprecipitation with BRCA1/
p220, AUF1, pCBP2, HuR or IgG (negative control)
antibodies. All immunoprecipitated samples were DNaseI
digested to ensure they were free from any genomic
contaminations before they were RT/PCR interrogated
for BRCA1-IRIS mRNA. GAPDH mRNA (none target)
was not immunoprecipitated by any antibody (Figure 4C),

and no PCR amplification was detected when no reverse
transcriptase (RT) was added to the reactions (Figure 4C).
In siLuc-transfected cells, AUF1, pCBP2, HuR and not
IgG or BRCA1/p220 antibodies co-immunoprecipitate
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA (Figure 4C). This association was
abolished when BRCA1/p220 was silenced (Figure 4C).
Finally, to confirm that these antibodies
immunoprecipitate their cognate proteins, HME cells were
transfected with BRCA1/p220 siRNA or the BRCA1/p220
mutant cell line; HCC1937 was infected with wild type
BRCA1/p220 expressing virus. Sp1 (negative control)
antibody immunoprecipitated similar amounts of Sp1 from
control and BRCA1/p220-silenced HME cells (Figure 4D,
left) as well as vector and BRCA1/p220 infected HCC1937
cells (Figure 4D, right). Higher AUF1 and pCBP2 were
immunoprecipitated from control- than BRCA1/p220silenced HME cells (Figure 4D, left), and increased
amount of BRCA1-IRIS was immunoprecipitated from
BRCA1/p220- compared to control-silenced HME cells
(Figure 4D, left). Furthermore, BRCA1/p220, AUF1
and pCBP2 were immunoprecipitated from BRCA1/
p220- and not vector-infected HCC1937 cells (Figure
4D, right) and increased amount of BRCA1-IRIS was
immunoprecipitated from vector- compared to BRCA1/
p220-infected HCC1937 cells (Figure 4D, right).
The
amounts
of
BRCA1-IRIS
mRNA
immunoprecipitated from control or BRCA1/p220 silenced
HME cells by IgG, AUF1, pCBP2, HuR and BRCA1/p220
antibodies were compared to the total BRCA1-IRIS mRNA
in polysome extracts using RT/qPCR. While equal amount
of BRCA1-IRIS mRNA was immunoprecipitated with
AUF1, pCBP2 and HuR antibodies from control treated
cells (~30-35% of total BRCA1-IRIS polysomic mRNA
see siLuc in Figure 4E), the amount immunoprecipitated
by AUF1 and pCBP2 dropped to <10%, while the
amount immunoprecipitated by HuR antibody increased
to ~50% in BRCA1/p220-silenced cells (Figure 4E). In
line with that, from polysome extracts, Sp1 antibody
immunoprecipitated no BRCA1-IRIS mRNA from
controls, BRCA1/p220-silenced HME cells or BRCA1/
p220-overexpressing HCC1937 cells (Figure 4F).
BRCA1/p220 silencing in HME cells decreased, whereas
BRCA1/p220 overexpression in HCC1937 cells increased
the level of BRCA1-IRIS mRNA immunoprecipitated by
AUF1 or pCBP2 antibody (Figure 4F). These data show
that BRCA1-IRIS mRNA is a target for the mRNA de/
stabilizing factors AUF1, pCBP2 and HuR in normal and
breast cancer cells, and that AUF1, pCBP2 and not HuR
expression is BRCA1/p220-dependent in these cells.

aggressive diseases expressing no-/low-BRCA1/p220,
made us wonder whether BRCA1/p220 loss enhances
the TN/BL phenotype via upregulating BRCA1-IRIS.
To test this hypothesis, BRCA1/p220 was silenced in
the BRCA1/p220-high-/BRCA1-IRIS-low expressing
HME cells (Figure 5A, upper panels). Total RNAs and
proteins collected from these cells were then probed for
the expression of the TN/BL markers, CK5, CK17, CDH3,
EGFR and cyclin E [35]. As expected, BRCA1/p220
silencing upregulated the expression of the mRNAs and
proteins of these markers (which otherwise expressed at
low levels in HME cells, see Figure 5A, lower panels).
More importantly, BRCA1-IRIS co-silencing in these
cells decreased the expression of these markers (Figure
5A, lower panels).
Furthermore, BRCA1-IRIS silencing in the TN/BL
cell line, SUM149 that expresses high levels of BRCA1IRIS, CK5, CK17, CDH3, EGFR, cyclin E but no BRCA1/
p220 (Figure 5B) significantly decreased the expression
of these TN/BL markers mRNAs and proteins (Figure
5B). Whereas, HCC1937, the BRCA1/p220 mutant cell
line that expresses high levels of BRCA1-IRIS and TN/
BL markers, but no wild type BRCA1/p220 (Figure 5C),
reconstitution with full-length BRCA1/p220 cDNA or
silencing BRCA1-IRIS in them (Figure 5C) decreased the
levels of TN/BL markers and BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and
protein (Figure 5C). These data establish that BRCA1/
p220 loss of expression or function enhances the TN/BL
phenotype in breast cancer cells via upregulating BRCA1IRIS expression.

BRCA1/p220 binds AUF1 and pCBP2 promoters
while BRCA1-IRIS binds CK5, CK17, CDH3,
EGFR and cyclin E promoters
Next, we asked whether these effects are
transcriptional. In chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments, exponentially growing HME cells
were cross-linked, sonicated (to generate ~500bp DNA
fragments), then extracts were immunoprecipitated with
IgG (negative control), BRCA1-IRIS or BRCA1/p220
monoclonal antibodies. After Immunoprecipitation, crosslinking was reversed and PCR was used to search for
specific DNA fragments immunoprecipitated with these
antibodies. BRCA1-IRIS co-immunoprecipitated CK5,
CK17, CDH3 and EGFR promoter fragments (Figure
5D, left), whereas BRCA1/p220 co-immunoprecipitated
AUF1 and pCBP2 promoter fragments (Figure 5D,
left). All promoters were present in the input of each
experiment (Figure 5D, left), and while inputs also
contained the fragments located ~10kb upstream of each
promoter (Figure 5D, right), these fragments were not
co-immunoprecipitated by BRCA1-IRIS or BRCA1/
p220 (Figure 5D, right) antibodies. These data show that
BRCA1/p220 binds AUF1 and pCBP2, while BRCA1-

since BRCA1/p220 silencing upregulates BRCA1-IRIS
expression, a slightly increased in luciferase expression
from CK5, EGFR and cyclin D1 promoters was measured
in these cells (Figure 5F, right). On the other hand, c-Jun
silencing suppressed luciferase expression from cyclin D1,
CK5 and EGFR promoters (Figure 5F, right) and more
importantly, BRCA1-IRIS silencing also significantly
reduced luciferase expression from these promoters
(Figure 5F, right). Luciferase expression from AUF1,
pCBP2 and GADD45 promoters was not affected by c-Jun
or BRCA1-IRIS silencing (Figure 5F, left). These data
show that BRCA1/p220 induces expression of AUF1 and
pCBP2 through binding to and activating Oct1 on their
promoters, whereas BRCA1-IRIS enhances expression of
this subset of TN/BL genes by binding to and activating
c-Jun on their promoters.

Potential transcriptional links necessary for
BRCA1/p220 or BRCA1-IRIS
Using in silico analysis we compared AUF1 and
pCBP2 (~1000bp upstream of +1 position) promoters in
search for common factors that could link BRCA1/p220
to these genes transcription. An Oct1 binding site was
common between AUF1 and pCBP2 promoters, which
is interesting, since BRCA1/p220 was shown recently to
induce transcription of several genes, including GADD45
through binding to Oct1 [37]. Also using in silico analysis
we compared the promoter regions of these TN/BL
genes (~1000bp upstream of +1 position) for common
transcription binding sites, and found that all but cyclin
E share an AP1 binding site. Importantly, we recently
showed that BRCA1-IRIS induces cyclin D1 expression
through binding to c-Jun/AP1 [32].
To study that, c-Jun was silenced in the BRCA1IRIS-overexpressing MDAMB231 cell line (72h,
Figure 5E, left upper panels) and Oct1 was silenced
in the BRCA1/p220-expression HME cell line (72h,
Figure 5E, right upper panels). ChIP analysis of extracts
isolated from these cells confirmed that c-Jun-silencing
in MDAMB231 cells significantly reduced the amounts
of CK5, CK17, CH3 and EGFR promoter fragments coimmunoprecipitated by BRCA1-IRIS antibody (Figure
5E, left lower panels), and Oct1-silencing in HME cells,
dramatically reduced the amount of AUF1 and pCBP2
promoter fragments co-immunoprecipitate by BRCA1/
p220 antibody (Figure 5E, right lower panels).
To ascertain these relationships further, CK5,
EGFR, AUF1, pCBP2 promoters were cloned upstream
of the luciferase gene in the pGL3 reporter plasmid. Three
Sp1 binding sites cloned upstream of the luciferase gene
in this reporter plasmid was used as negative control.
Positive controls for BRCA1-IRIS transcription activity
was cyclin D1 promoter driving luciferase reporter (see
[31]), and for BRCA1/p220 induced transcription activity
was GADD45 driven luciferase reporter (see [37]). The
pGL3-AUF1, -pCBP2 and -GADD45, -CK5, -EGFR
and -CycD1 constructs were co-transfected with GFP-,
BRCA1/p220-, Oct1-, BRCA1-IRIS- or c-Jun-silenced
HME (inset in Figure 5F) or MDAMB231 (not shown)
cells, respectively. Luciferase activity from each reporter
following the different treatments was measured in each
case 72h later.
As expected Oct1 silencing significantly decreased
luciferase expression from GADD45, AUF1 and
pCBP2 promoters (Figure 5F, left), but had no effect on
CK5, EGFR or cyclin D1 promoters (Figure 5F, right).
Importantly, BRCA1/p220 silencing also significantly
suppressed luciferase expression from GADD45, AUF1
and pCBP2 promoters (Figure 5F, left), and as expected

Loss of BRCA1/p220 enhances tumor cell survival
via BRCA1-IRIS overexpression
Next, we studied whether BRCA1-IRIS
overexpression in no/low BRCA1/p220 expressing
cells promotes their survival and hence drug resistance
phenotype associated with TN/BL breast cancers. BRCA1IRIS and BRCA1/p220 were separately or together
silenced or BRCA1-IRIS was overexpressed alone or
in BRCA1/p220-silenced (i.e. BRCA1/p220 silenced in
induced IRISb cells) in HME cells. Sonicated proteins
were analyzed for expression and activation of AKT
and its down-stream targets survivin and BAD 72h later
[38,39].
Control treated HME cells express high levels
of BRCA1/p220, AKT, survivin (Figure 6A) and low
levels of BRCA1-IRIS, phosphorylated (on T308/
S473)/activated AKT (hereafter p-AKT, Figure 6A) and
phosphorylated (on S112/136)/inactivated BAD (hereafter
p-BAD, Figure 6A). BRCA1-IRIS silencing had no effect
on BRCA1/p220 expression (Figure 6A), dramatically
decreased AKT, and survivin expression (Figure 6A,
also [34]) and led to significant decrease in HME and
HCC1937 cells viability as measured using MTT and
activated caspase3/7, respectively (Figure 6C and D).
BRCA1/p220 and BRCA1-IRIS co-silenced cells showed
similar phenotypes to BRCA1-IRIS only silenced cells
(Figure 6A-D).
Conversely, BRCA1/p220 silencing upregulated
expression of BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, p-AKT, survivin and
p-Bad (Figure 6A), which led to a slight but significant
increase in viability and decrease in caspase3/7 activation
(Figure 6C). BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (i.e. induced
IRISb cells) had no effect on BRCA1/p220 expression,
dramatically increased AKT, p-AKT, survivin (Figure
6B, also see [34]) and p-BAD expression (Figure 6B) and
significantly increased HME and HCC1937 cells viability
(Figure 6C and D). Indeed, BRCA1/p220 silencing in

induced IRISb cells (which significantly increased
BRCA1-IRIS, AKT, p-AKT, survivin and p-BAD
levels, Figure 6B) or BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in
HCC1937 dramatically reduced the level of activated
caspase 3/7, which led to increase in cell number in
both cell lines above control treated cells (Figure 6C
and D). Importantly, overexpressing of wild type or
clinically relevant BRCA1/p220 mutant in HCC1937
could not overcome the inhibitory effect observed with
BRCA1-IRIS silencing (Figure 6D).
Finally, colony assay was used to assess
the transformation capabilities of BRCA1-IRIS
overexpression or BRCA1/p220 silencing. HME
cells were transfected with control or BRCA1-IRISexpressing vector, HCC1937 cells were transfected
with control or BRCA1/p220-expressing vector, and
MDAMB468 cells were transfected with appropriate
control, BRCA1-IRIS siRNA or BRCA1/p220expressing vector. All cell lines were grown in soft

agar for 2 weeks, at which time formed colonies were
stained and counted. Compared to control treated
cells, BRCA1-IRIS overexpression increased the
number of HME colonies (Figure 6E, left), BRCA1/
p220 overexpression reduced the number of HCC1937
colonies (Figure 6E, middle) and BRCA1-IRIS
silencing or BRCA1/p220 overexpression reduced
MDAMB468 colonies (Figure 6E, right). These data
show that BRCA1-IRIS overexpression, like BRCA1/
p220 dowregulation initiates and/or maintains the
transformation of mammary cells.

DISCUSSION
BRCA1-IRIS is a novel BRCA1/p220 locus
produced oncogene. BRCA1/p220 inhibition or
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in mammary epithelial
cells enhances expression of cyclin D1, AKT and
several other proliferation and survival proteins [31-

34,40,41, and this study]. BRCA1/p220 loss [42] or
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (ElShamy, unpublished)
confers tamoxifen resistance in mammary epithelial
cells. These observations support the view that BRCA1IRIS overexpressing cells are phenotypically equivalent
to no/low BRCA1/p220 expressing cells. In this study
we presented a mechanistical support for this notion. We
showed that, at least partially, BRCA1/p220 loss increases
BRCA1-IRIS expression by a post-transcriptional
mechanism, explaining the inverse relationship between
the two genes.
Human and rat BRCA1/p220 mRNA 3`-UTR
(~1.5kb) contains several HuR binding sites [43]. The
BRCA1-IRIS 3`-UTR (~300bp from intron 11), on the
other hand contains binding sites for pCBP2 [22], AUF1
and HuR [21]. It is possible that HuR stabilizes both
mRNAs, and that we fail to detect an effect of HuR on
BRCA1-IRIS mRNA in HME cells is because the effect
is perhaps masked by the fact that these cells are BRCA1/
p220 proficient and hence express high levels of AUF1,
that binds the same sites as HuR [21]. When BRCA1/p220
expression and/or function are lost and AUF1 expression
is dropped (e.g., in cancer cells), BRCA1-IRIS mRNA is
perhaps stabilized by HuR.
In fact, we recently performed immunohistochemical
analysis of breast cancer tissue microarray (containing
>300 aggressive breast cancer tumor samples) and
discovered that compared to normal tissue, BRCA1IRIS is overexpressed in the majority of these tumors,
that expressed very low levels of AUF1 and pCBP2,
high levels of cytoplasmic HuR and no BRCA1/p220
(ElShamy WM, unpublished data). Cytoplasmic HuR was
proposed recently to be an independent prognostic factor
for familial breast cancers and a poor prognosis factor for
sporadic and familial breast cancers, or could even be a
contributing factor to the disease [44,45]. In fact, in our
recent publication [33] we showed a strong correlation
between BRCA1-IRIS overexpression and cytoplasmic
localization of HuR, in vitro [33].
pCBP2 binds to and activates BRCA1/p220
promoter [46]. It is possible that a positive feedback
mechanism between BRCA1/p220 and pCBP2 exists,
which is broken in BRCA1/p220-mutant or TN/BL cells.
Further studies to elucidate the role of posttranscriptional
mechanisms controlling BRCA1/p220 and BRCA1-IRIS
mRNA expression in normal and breast cancer cells are
required to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the
development of familial and TN/BL breast cancers.
The inverse relationship we propose here between
expression of BRCA1/p220 and BRCA1-IRIS seems
not to be complete. For instance, although MCF7 and
MDAMB231 cell lines express high levels of BRCA1IRIS, both cell lines still express detectable levels of
BRCA1/p220 (see above). It is possible that while
intriguing, this mechanism is perhaps not the only
mechanism involved. In this regard, we recently found
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that BRCA1-IRIS was overexpressed in xenograft
or orthotopic tumors generated using HME cells
overexpressing TERT/LT/RasV12 [47]. Oncogenic Ras
is known to suppress expression of several transcription
factors, including vitamin D during mammary epithelial
cell transformation [48]. It is possible that vitamin D is a
transcription suppressor of BRCA1-IRIS. However, this
remains only a hypothesis until the promoter of BRCA1IRIS has been cloned.
Alternatively, oncogenic Ras overexpression was
shown recently to decrease the expression of AUF1
during mammary cell transformation [49]. It is possible
that in BRCA1/p220 expressing breast cancer tumor cells,
RasV12 instead stabilizes BRCA1-IRIS mRNA leading
to its protein overexpression. However, what was even
more surprising is the fact that tumors generated using
HME cells overexpressing TERT/LT/BRCA1-IRIS
were BRCA1/p220-negative [47]. If true also in human
tumors, this suggests that BRCA1/p220 loss of expression
increases BRCA1-IRIS, which in a negative feedback
mechanism suppress BRCA1/p220 expression.
It is possible that patients with tumors lacking
BRCA1/p220 expression or function are hit twice. Once
by losing the powerful tumor suppressor, BRCA1/p220,
which is involved in DNA-damage repair, cell cycle
arrest, transcription and chromatin remodeling and a
second time by gaining the powerful oncogene, BRCA1IRIS, which enhances cell proliferation and survival when
overexpressed. This combined effect, perhaps, contributes
to increase aggressiveness and drug resistance phenotypes
in no/low BRCA1/p220 expressing breast tumors, and
support the view that the two proteins affect a linear
pathway(s), in which BRCA1/p220 silencing and/or
BRCA1-IRIS overexpression gives survival advantages to
cancer cells and promotes the formation of death resistant
TN/BL breast cancer cells. We therefore propose that
chemotherapeutical targeting of BRCA1-IRIS might be
beneficial in eradicating BRCA1/p220-associated or TN/
BL tumors cancer diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
Human mammary epithelial cells were cultured in
MEGM modified medium (Lonza). All other breast cancer
cell lines used in this study were grown in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% FBS. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting BRCA1/p220 and BRCA1-IRIS were
described earlier [30], whereas BARD1, AUF, pCPB2
and HuR siRNAs were from Dharmacon. Transfections
of plasmids with or without siRNAs were done using
oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Plasmid transfection was
done using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were

harvested after transfection at the indicated times.

Establishment of doxycycline-induced BRCA1IRIS expression in HME cells

mRNA stability
For mRNA half-life assessments, three independent
experiments were performed. Actinomycin D (5µg/
ml) was added and total RNA was prepared at the
times indicated; mRNA half-lives were calculated after
quantifying by RT/qPCR, normalizing to 18S RNA levels
(using a 1:20 dilution of the stock sample), plotting on
logarithmic scales using GraphPad Prism, and calculating
the time period required for a given transcript to undergo a
reduction to one-half of its initial abundance (at time zero,
before adding actinomycin D) using non-linear regression
analysis. Comparisons of treatment outcomes were tested
for statistical differences using the Student t-test for paired
data. Statistical significance was assumed at a p-value of
≤ 0.05.

Full-length BRCA1-IRIS cDNAs containing the
entire 3`-UTR was amplified from HME total RNA using
primers described earlier [30] was cloned in the pRevTRE
plasmid (Clontech). pRev-TRE-IRIS was subsequently
transfected into selected, rtTA-producing HME clones
followed by selection with 150µg/ml hygromycin B
(Sigma). Tet-responsive expression of BRCA1-IRIS
by doxycycline (1-2 µg, Clontech) was monitored by
using real time RT/PCR and/or by western analysis. The
authenticity of all constructs used for transfections was
verified by sequencing.

Transient infection of BRCA1-IRIS or BRCA1/
p220 cDNA

Immunoprecipitation of RNP complexes

In some experiments a lentivirus expressing fulllength BRCA1/p220 or BRCA1-IRIS was used to express
either protein in transient expression. Verification of
expression was done using western blotting.

Immunoprecipitation (IP) of AUF1, pCBP2 or HuR
and BRCA1-IRIS mRNA complexes from HME cell lysates
was used to assess the association of the endogenous
proteins with endogenous BRCA1-IRIS mRNA. The IP
assay was performed essentially as described earlier [33].
Following Immunoprecipitation, extensive washes and
digestion of proteins in the IP material [33], the RNA
was extracted and used to perform reverse transcription
(RT) followed by PCR to detect the presence of BRCA1IRIS mRNA using gene-specific primer pairs described in
[30]. GAPDH mRNA was used to normalize the data. We
routinely normalized the results by measuring in parallel
the binding of BRCA1-IRIS mRNA to IgG and to antiAUF1, pCBP2 or HuR antibodies [33].

Western blot analysis.
Whole-cell lysates were prepared using cell
sonication [33,34]. Protein lysates were resolved
by NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto
nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. Antibodies used
to detect BRCA1-IRIS are mouse monoclonal antibody
developed in the lab, to detect BRCA1/p220 we use the
mouse monoclonal antibody SG-11 (Calbiochem, San
Diego, Calif), AUF1, pCBP2, HuR and β-actin (Sigma),
AKT1, AKT2, p-(T308/S473)-AKT, survivin and
p-(S112/136)-BAD (Cell Signaling), rabbit monoclonal
CK5 (ab75869), CK17 (ab51056), mouse monoclonal
CDH3 (ab19350), EGFR (ab5368-13) and rabbit
polyclonal cyclin E (ab93161) all from abcam. Following
secondary antibody incubations, signals were visualized
by enhanced chemo-luminescence.

Luciferase analysis
A 210bp representing the entire 3`-UTR of BRCA1IRIS or the 3`-UTR of c-fos [30,50,51] were subcloned
into the HpaI site of the Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase
(RSV-Luc) expression vector. A plasmid encoding RSVβ-galactosidase (RSV-β-Gal; ATCC) was co-transfected
as an internal control. In other experiments, fragments
(~1-3kb) containing human AUF1, pCBP2, CK5, EGFR,
CycD1 or GADD45 genes promoter elements were
generated by PCR amplification from human genomic
DNA (G304A, Promega). Each promoter fragment was
cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene
in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) using the protocol
described in Chock et al., 2010a. The resultant plasmids
were designated as pGL3-AUF1, -pCBP2, -GADD45,
-CK5, -EGFR and –CycD1. Comparisons of treatment

RT/PCR analysis
Total RNA, isolated with Trizol (Gibco, Life
Technologies) and DNaseI-treated, was routinely used in
RT-PCR experiments using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR
with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). Routinely, 5 μg of total
RNA or 10 μg of poly A+ RNA were used as a template in
each reaction for amplification of ~450bp of BRCA1-IRIS
RNA (that is, nucleotides 3,744–4,199 of BRCA1-IRIS
cDNA), ~486bp of BRCA1/p220 RNA (that is, nucleotides
4,674–5,160 of BRCA1 cDNA) or ~350bp of GAPDH
RNA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
