ABSTRACT
The successes of targeted therapeutics against EGFR and ALK in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) have demonstrated the substantial survival gains made possible
by precision therapy. However, the majority of patients do not have tumors with
genetic alterations responsive to these therapies, and therefore identification of
new targets is needed. Our laboratory previously identified MER receptor tyrosine
kinase as one such potential target. We now report our findings targeting MER with
a clinically translatable agent – Mer590, a monoclonal antibody specific for MER.
Mer590 rapidly and robustly reduced surface and total MER levels in multiple cell lines.
Treatment reduced surface MER levels by 87%, and this effect was maximal within
four hours. Total MER levels were also dramatically reduced, and this persisted for
at least seven days. Mechanistically, MER down-regulation was mediated by receptor
internalization and degradation, leading to inhibition of downstream signaling through
STAT6, AKT, and ERK1/2. Functionally, this resulted in increased apoptosis, increased
chemosensitivity to carboplatin, and decreased colony formation. In addition to
carboplatin, Mer590 interacted cooperatively with shRNA-mediated MER inhibition
to augment apoptosis. These data demonstrate that MER inhibition can be achieved
with a monoclonal antibody in NSCLC. Optimization toward a clinically available antiMER antibody is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against mutated EGFR
or ALK fusion proteins have transformed treatment
outcomes for the ~10% and ~4%, respectively, of Western
NSCLC patients whose tumors are driven by one of these
activated oncogenes. This has improved survival over
conventional chemotherapeutics while offering a more
tolerable side effect profile [4-8]. Monoclonal antibodies
are another method to specifically target proteins that
promote tumorigenesis or allow tumor survival. Thirteen

Optimization of conventional chemotherapy
regimens has led to modest gains in survival in NSCLC
over the past few decades, and studies suggest that new
treatment strategies must be pursued in order to achieve
more impressive clinical gains [1-3]. Toward this end,
therapies that target specific molecular aberrations in
NSCLC cells have begun to emerge. Small molecule

antibodies are currently FDA approved for the treatment
of various neoplastic diseases, with many more in various
stages of pre-clinical development [9]. Only one, the antiVEGF-A antibody bevacizumab, is FDA approved for
the treatment of NSCLC, in combination with paclitaxel
and carboplatin [10]. Despite these advances, targeted
therapies are not currently available for the majority of
patients, whose tumors are not driven by these specific
molecular aberrations. Identification of novel targets
is therefore a priority in order to increase the number
of patients who will benefit from biologically-oriented
therapeutics.
One family of proteins that has gained increased
attention as a possible target for cancer therapy is the
TAM family, composed of the receptor tyrosine kinases
TYRO3, AXL, and MER. Monoclonal antibodies against
TYRO3 have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical
melanoma models, and antibodies against AXL have been
efficacious in breast and lung cancer models [11,12]. The
third member of the family, MER, has also been validated
as a potential drug target in cancer. MER is over-expressed
or aberrantly expressed in a wide variety of human
malignancies [13-21]. Importantly, MER activates an
extensive network of pro-oncogenic downstream signaling
pathways mediating survival, proliferation, and migration
of cancer cells [22]. In NSCLC in particular, MER is overexpressed in approximately two-thirds of patient tumors,
regardless of histology, and inhibition of MER by shRNA
in NSCLC cell lines promoted apoptosis and reduced
colony formation in soft agar, as well as prevented in vivo
tumor growth in a murine subcutaneous xenograft model
[13]. These data suggest that development of clinically
relevant MER inhibitors is warranted. Our group has been
developing MER-selective small molecule inhibitors, and
in this study we report our efforts to target MER using
a novel monoclonal antibody, Mer590 [19, 23-26]. We
have previously demonstrated that Mer590 decreases
glioblastoma cell migration in vitro [27]. Here we further
advance the case for development by providing preclinical evidence characterizing its mechanism of action,
its effects on downstream signaling, and its combinatorial
effects with conventional chemotherapy and a second
mechanism of MER inhibition in NSCLC cells.

levels of the closely related receptor tyrosine kinase,
AXL (Figure 1A). Comparable results were obtained
after 48 hours of Mer590 treatment (data not shown).
Additional experiments with HCC15 cells demonstrated
persistent knockdown of MER seven days after a single
application of Mer590 (data not shown). As total MER
decrease was consistent in all four NSCLC cell lines
assayed, we selected two representative cell lines for
further study: Colo699 because it does not express AXL
and is MER-dependent, and H2009 as a representative
cell line expressing both MER and AXL. Like total MER
expression, surface MER expression as measured by flow
cytometry was also decreased after Mer590 treatment,
with a reduction of 87% after 48 hours of treatment in the
Colo699 cell line (Figure 1B). Dose-response curves were
generated, and indicate that a concentration of 6.25 ng/ml
of Mer590 was sufficient to decrease MER surface levels
by 50%, while a concentration of 50 ng/ml was sufficient
to produce the maximal decrease in MER surface levels
(Figure 1C). Finally, the kinetics of the Mer590-induced
decrease in MER surface levels were determined, again
by surface flow cytometry. At concentrations of 6.25 or
200 ng/ml of Mer590, maximal reduction of surface MER
was achieved within four hours of Mer590 exposure,
independent of the dose (Figure 1D).

Mer590 Induces Receptor Internalization of MER
Possible explanations for the reduction of total MER
protein levels in response to Mer590 treatment include
promotion of MER extracellular domain (ECD) shedding,
and induction of MER internalization and degradation. A
number of antibodies have been developed to target the
MET receptor tyrosine kinase, and both mechanisms of
action have been demonstrated, depending on the specific
antibody utilized [28,29]. Additionally, the MER ECD can
be cleaved from the cell surface under basal conditions,
and ECD shedding is increased in response to stimulation
with lipopolysaccharide or phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate, posing the possibility that MER ECD shedding
may also be induced by Mer590 administration [30]. To
distinguish between these two mechanisms, levels of MER
ECD in culture media with and without Mer590 were
measured by western blot analysis (Figure 2A). Soluble
MER protein was visualized at the expected molecular
weight of 120-130 kDa [30]. Administration of Mer590
resulted in decreased MER ECD levels in the culture
media compared to mIgG1 treated cells. Whole cell
lysates were used to confirm efficacy of MER decrease
by Mer590 (Figure 2B). The reduction of MER ECD in
conditioned media would not be expected if the action of
Mer590 was to increase receptor cleavage. The result is
consistent with Mer590-induced receptor internalization,
reducing surface MER available for cleavage.
To further test the hypothesis that Mer590 induces
receptor internalization, cells were incubated with Mer590

RESULTS
Mer590 Decreases Total Cellular and Surface
MER Expression
We generated a novel monoclonal antibody,
Mer590, against the extracellular domain of human MER
in mouse hybridoma cells [27]. A 24-hour exposure
to 0.5 μg/ml Mer590 significantly reduced MER total
protein levels in four NSCLC cell lines, without affecting

at 4° C for 20 minutes. Although antibody binding occurs
at this temperature, receptor internalization cannot [32].
Half of the samples were subsequently kept at 4° C and
half were moved to 37° C for 20 minutes, a temperature
permissible for receptor internalization. Cells were
then fixed and either stained to detect surface MER, or
permeabilized and stained to detect total MER. Median
fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels were then determined
by flow cytometry. After moving to the permissive
temperature, cell surface levels of MER decreased by
52.6% and 58.4%, in the Colo699 and H2009 cell lines,
respectively, while total MER levels were decreased by
only 24.9% and 20.0% (Figure 2C) If Mer590 induced
receptor cleavage, an equal loss would be expected from
the cell surface and total levels; however, the selective loss
of MER from the cell surface is consistent with receptor

internalization. The small loss of total MER levels may be
due to lysosomal degradation, the end-point of receptor
internalization, taking place within the 20 minutes at the
permissive temperature prior to fixation.
Together, the decreased MER ECD shedding
into the media, and the decreased surface:total MER
ratio, demonstrate that Mer590 promotes receptor
internalization.

Mer590 Prevents MER Phosphorylation and
Downstream Signaling
MER is activated by several ligands, including
Gas6, which induces receptor autophosphorylation and
activation of a wide variety of downstream signaling

(A) A549, H2009, HCC15, and Colo699 cells were cultured in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml Mer590, 0.5 μg/ml isotype control murine

expression after Mer590 treatment without affecting expression of the related receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. Tubulin was used as a loading

pathways [22]. To determine if Mer590 interferes with
these signaling processes, cells were pre-treated with
Mer590 or vehicle control for 48 hours, then cultured with
or without serum in the continued absence or presence of
Mer590 for two hours. At this point, cells were stimulated
with either Gas6 or vehicle control for ten minutes. Cells
were lysed and total and phospho-MER levels assessed by
immunoprecipitation and western blotting (Figure 3A). As
expected, Gas6 induced MER phosphorylation; this was
prevented by Mer590 treatment (lanes 5,6, 11, and 12).
Mer590 also reduced basal levels of phospho-MER in
H2009 cells cultured in complete medium (lanes 7,8), as
well as residual levels of phospho-MER in serum starved
H2009 cells (lanes 9,10). In Colo699 cells, both phosphoMER and total MER were undetectable in samples treated
with Mer590 (lanes 2, 4, and 6). To determine if inhibition
of MER activation translated to reduced downstream
signaling, cells were treated with Mer590 for 24 hours

in the absence of serum, then stimulated with Gas6 for
ten minutes. Phosphorylated and total STAT6, AKT,
and ERK1/2 levels were then assessed by western blot.
Mer590 pre-treatment resulted in decreased levels of
Gas6-activated STAT6, AKT, and ERK1/2 in the Colo699
cell line, and decreased levels of Gas6-activated AKT and
ERK1/2 in the H2009 cell line (Figure 3B).

NSCLC Colony Formation is Reduced by Mer590
Treatment
To determine the long-term effects of Mer590, we
utilized a re-plating assay. In this experiment, cells were
treated for 72 hours with Mer590 or vehicle control,
and then counted. Equal numbers of live cells were then
re-plated at low density in fresh media and allowed to
grow and form colonies for 10 days in the absence of

containing 10% FBS. The next morning, the medium was replaced with serum-free RPMI containing vehicle control (PBS), isotype antibody
control (1 μg/ml mIgG1), or Mer590 (0.5 or 1 μg/ml). After 24 hours, the culture supernatants were collected, filtered to remove any floating
cells and cellular debris, and concentrated approximately 40-fold using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (Millipore UFC803096).

minutes at 4°C to allow binding to MER without induction of internalization. Cells were then either kept at 4°C or shifted to 37°C for 20
minutes to allow for internalization before fixing in paraformaldehyde. Half of the samples were then stained for surface MER, while half
were permeabilized and stained for total MER, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative histograms are shown above, with
quantification of median fluorescence index (MFI) values below. MFI values relative to samples kept at 4°C were determined, such that loss
of MER in each compartment upon shifting to 37°C could be assessed.

any treatment. This experiment determines the residual
effects of Mer590 treatment on cells that have survived
the initial treatment period, but may be compromised in
their ability to re-populate when Mer590 is withdrawn.
As demonstrated in Figure 3C, treatment with Mer590
significantly decreased Colo699 colony number by 27.8%
(p=0.0353). These results were confirmed in a second
cell line, H2009, in which administration of Mer590
reduced colony formation in the re-plating assay by 36.8%
(p=0.0013).

carboplatin. Live, early apoptotic, and dead cells were
quantified by flow cytometry after staining with YoPro1-iodide and propidium iodide (Figure 4A,B). Treatment
with 1μg/ml Mer590 alone reduced the number of live
cells from 71.5% to 60.0% compared to mIgG1 treated
cells (p=0.0214), while 10 μM or 15 μM carboplatin (plus
mIgG1) reduced the percentage of live cells to 51.6% and
49.6%, respectively (p=0.0015, p=0.0091). Treatment with
a combination of Mer590 and 10 μM or 15 μM carboplatin
resulted in the greatest induction of cell death, with only
40.3% and 31.5% live cells remaining, respectively
(p=0.0009, p<0.0001). Induction of apoptotic cell death
was confirmed biochemically by western blot analysis of
PARP cleavage, which was highest in cells treated with
both carboplatin and Mer590. (Figure 4C). Additionally,
carboplatin alone induced a dose-dependent increase in
pERK levels. However, Mer590 administration reduced
carboplatin-induced pERK activation, potentially blocking
a pathway used to escape carboplatin-induced apoptosis.

Mer590 Enhances Carboplatin-Induced Apoptosis
Carboplatin and cisplatin are commonly
administered with pemetrexed as the standard of care
regimen for patients with NSCLC [33]. We determined
whether Mer590 increased induction of apoptosis in
NSCLC cells in response to treatment with chemotherapy.
Colo699 cells were treated with vehicle control, mIgG1,
or Mer590 in the presence or absence of 10 μM or 15 μM

were cultured for 24 hours in serum-free medium containing Mer590 (2 μg/ml) or PBS vehicle. 200 nM rmGas6 was added for 10 minutes

5A). Interestingly, carboplatin treatment increased total
levels of MER expression (Figure 5A), possibly as a
compensatory survival response. The chemotherapyinduced MER up-regulation may reflect an increased
reliance on MER signaling in the presence of carboplatin,
and provide a rationale for carboplatin and MER-targeted
agent combinations.

In addition to chemotherapy, Mer590 could also be
administered in combination with alternative mechanisms
of MER inhibition. Mer590 plus shRNA against MER
synergized with carboplatin to cause increased apoptosis.
A dual inhibition strategy against a single receptor has
been successfully utilized against the ERBB family of
receptors, where the antibodies cetuximab, panitumumab,
or trastuzumab have been combined with small molecule
inhibitors, including gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or
lapatinib, in several clinical trials [35]. The combination
of cetuximab and afatinib showed promising results in a
phase Ib/II trial in NSCLC, and cetuximab paired with
either gefitinib or erlotinib has generated promising data
in patients with colon cancer. The most impressive clinical
data thus far; however, have been generated in breast
cancer, in which the combination of trastuzumab plus
lapatinib has increased survival in two phase III clinical
trials. In one trial, the effect was compared to lapatinib
alone, while in the second, where the drug combination
was given in combination with paclitaxel, survival was
increased as compared to paclitaxel plus either targeted
therapy alone.
In conclusion, we have developed a novel
monoclonal antibody, Mer590, that inhibits MER receptor
tyrosine kinase, a recently validated target in NSCLC.
This manuscript describes critical pre-clinical experiments
demonstrating the mechanism of action and the therapeutic
potential of this antibody. Treatment with Mer590 is
sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death and reduce colony
formation and these effects can be augmented when given
in conjunction with carboplatin or genetic inhibition
of MER. Taken together, these data validate antibodymediated targeting of MER as an attractive strategy for
treatment of lung cancer that deserves further optimization
and investigation.

DISCUSSION
Our group has previously validated MER as a
potential therapeutic target in NSCLC by demonstrating
that shRNA-mediated MER knockdown results in
decreased pro-oncogenic signaling, synergy with standard
chemotherapeutic agents, increased induction of apoptosis,
and decreased colony and tumor formation in long-term
assays [13]. In this study, we furthered this work by
demonstrating that a clinically relevant therapeutic agent,
a novel anti-MER monoclonal antibody, can phenocopy
the effects of genetic inhibition of MER.
Mer590 treatment of NSCLC cells resulted in
reduced surface and total levels of MER. This effect
occurred rapidly (over one to four hours), lasted for up
to seven days, and could be achieved with concentrations
in the low nanogram/milliliter range. MER inhibition
translated to a decrease in phosphorylated MER and a
concurrent decrease in activation of downstream prooncogenic signaling molecules, including STAT6, AKT,
and ERK1/2. Functional effects of these biochemical
changes included increased apoptosis and decreased
colony formation, mediated by Mer590 as a single agent
and in combination with carboplatin or shRNA against
MER.
The apoptosis and re-plating assays used here
complement each other and highlight the ability of Mer590
to induce both short-term increases in apoptosis and the
delayed effect of decreased colony forming potential
even in cells that survive the initial treatment period. This
residual defect in colony formation could theoretically
be important in reducing the ability of cancer cells to
repopulate leading to recurrence after a treatment cycle.
An additional feature of clinically relevant MERtargeted therapy is a potential increased efficacy of
standard chemotherapeutics, which have previously been
shown to interact synergistically with shRNA-mediated
MER inhibition in NSCLC, and with small moleculemediated MER inhibition in ALL [13, 25]. In this study,
Mer590 interacted synergistically with carboplatin, a
commonly used chemotherapy for NSCLC treatment.
These data indicate the possibility that co-administration
of MER-targeted agents with carboplatin may decrease
tumor burden more effectively than carboplatin alone.
Alternatively, utilization of MER-targeted agents may
allow for dose-reduction of standard chemotherapy, with
the goal of fewer or less severe side effects for NSCLC
patients.

1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4) supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Molecular
Biochemicals), or washed with PBS and scraped into lysis
buffer. Total protein concentrations were determined and
western blotting was performed as previously described
[13].

Sub-confluent cultures (approximately 5 x 105 cells)
were pre-treated with 2 μg/mL Mer590 or PBS vehicle
control in serum-free RPMI culture medium for 24 hours.
200 nM rmGas6 was then added to each well for 10
minutes before cells were lysed. Lysates were quantified
by Bradford assay and analyzed by western blot.

Antibodies for western blotting and flow
cytometry

Flow cytometric detection of surface and total
proteins

For western blotting, the following antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling: pAKT (S473, Cat# 9271),
AKT (Cat# 9272), Enolase-1 (Cat# 3810), pERK1/2
(T202/Y204, Cat# 9106), ERK1/2 (Cat# 9102), PARP
(Cat# 9542), pSTAT6 (Y641, Cat# 9361), STAT6 (Cat#
9362), TYRO3 (Cat# 5585), and α-tubulin (Cat# 2125).
Additional antibodies used for western blotting include
AXL (R&D Systems, AF154), pMER (Y749, Y753,
Y754, PhosphoSolutions), and MER (Abcam 52968).
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, Bio-Rad 170-6515; goat antimouse, Bio-Rad 170-6516; donkey anti-goat, Santa Cruz
sc-2020) were used for enhanced chemiluminescence
of western blots. The following antibodies were used
for measurement of indirect immunofluorescence using
flow cytometry: mouse monoclonal anti-MER (Caveo
Therapeutics, CVO-590) and phycoerythrin-conjugated
donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch, 715116-150) (Figure 1) or Mer590 and allophycocyaninconjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch,
715-136-150) (Figure 2). All antibodies were used as
recommended by the manufacturer unless otherwise
specified.

Sub-confluent cultures (approximately 5 x 105 cells)
were washed with PBS and lifted with 0.02% EDTA in
PBS. Harvested cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Figure 2C) or not (Figure 1), then washed in FACS
wash buffer (2% FBS and 0.02% azide in PBS) prior to
staining in 50 μl staining solution (1% FBS and 0.02%
azide in PBS) containing primary antibody, murine
immunoglobulin (mIgG1, R&D Systems, MAB002), or
vehicle control, for 15-30 minutes at 4°C. Cells were
washed again in FACS wash buffer, and then incubated
in staining solution containing fluorophore-conjugated
secondary antibody or vehicle control for 15-30 minutes
at 4°C. Stained cells were washed in FACS wash buffer,
resuspended in staining solution, and fluorescence
of surface-bound antibodies was measured by flow
cytometry. For assessment of total MER, cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in FACS wash buffer,
permeabilized in permeabilization/wash buffer (BD,
554723), resuspended in staining solution containing
secondary antibody or vehicle control for 30 minutes at
4°C, washed in perm/wash buffer, and resuspended in
staining solution before analysis by flow cytometry.

Assessment of downstream signaling

of

Lentiviral transduction and isolation of clonal
populations

Cells were treated with the phosphatase inhibitor
pervanadate (0.12mM Na3VO4 in 0.002% H2O2 in PBS) for
5 minutes (H2009) or 1 minute (Colo699), and then lysed.
Lysates were incubated with antibodies against MER
(R&D Systems MAB8912) and rec-Protein G-sepharose
4B beads (Invitrogen 10-1242) overnight. Beads were
washed twice with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were
eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl
pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS,
and 0.01% bromophenol blue). Proteins were resolved

Lentiviral vectors (pLKO.1) containing shRNA
sequences targeting MER (shMer1, Oligo ID:
TRCN0000000862), or non-silencing control GFP
(shControl, catalog no. RHS4459) were obtained from
Open Biosystems. Lentiviral particles were produced in
293FT cells and Colo699 target cells were transduced as
previously described [13]. Polyclonal populations were
maintained in selection medium containing puromycin (2
μg/ml). Stable clonal isolates were obtained by single-cell
sorting using flow cytometry. Clonal populations were
cultured in puromycin for 2-3 doubling times every 2-3
