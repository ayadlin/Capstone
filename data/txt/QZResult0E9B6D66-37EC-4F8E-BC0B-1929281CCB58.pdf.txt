Abstract
Noninvasive detection of dysplasia provides a potential
platform for monitoring the efficacy of chemopreventive
therapy of premalignancy, imaging the tissue compartments
comprising dysplasia: epithelium, microvasculature, and
stromal inflammatory cells. Here, using respiratory-gated
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the anatomy of premalignant and malignant stages of cervical carcinogenesis in
estrogen-treated K14-HPV16 transgenic mice was noninvasively defined. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI was
used to quantify leakage across premalignant dysplastic
microvasculature. Vascular permeability as measured by
DCE-MRI, K trans, was similar in transgenic (0.053 F 0.020
min 1; n = 32 mice) and nontransgenic (0.056 F 0.029 min 1;
n = 17 mice) animals despite a 2-fold increase in microvascular area in the former compared with the latter. DCE-MRI
did detect a significant decrease in vascular permeability
accompanying diminution of dysplastic microvasculature by
the antiangiogenic agent, vascular endothelial growth factor
Trap (K trans = 0.052 F 0.013 min 1 pretreatment; n = 6 mice
versus K trans = 0.019 F 0.008 min 1 post-treatment; n = 5
mice). Thus, we determined that the threshold of microvessel
leakage associated with cervical dysplasia was <17 kDa and
highlighted the potential of DCE-MRI to noninvasively
monitor the efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs or chemoprevention regimens targeting the vasculature in premalignant cervical dysplasia. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):7945–52]

Introduction
Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy
affecting women worldwide (1). Although effective screening has
markedly diminished cervical cancer incidence in the United
States, dysplasia remains a common clinical challenge requiring
surgical extirpation for high-grade lesions (1, 2). As such,
noninvasive therapy for premalignant, but high-risk, dysplasias
would be a tremendous boon to gynecologic care.
Dysplastic lesions are characterized by disorganized epithelial
differentiation. The uterine cervical squamous epithelium can
harbor dysplasia initiated by oncogenic human papillomaviruses
(HPV), most frequently types 16 and 18 (1). Normal cervical

epithelium is composed of a basal layer that is immature and
proliferative and multiple suprabasal layers of differentiating
squamous cells that are ultimately shed from the top of the
epithelium into the cervical canal or vaginal lumen. Increasing
grades of dysplasia are characterized by progressive occupation of
the suprabasal layer by basaloid squamous cells (1). High-grade
dysplasia, if untreated, has an extremely high incidence of
conversion to malignancy (2). Cervical dysplasia and dysplastic
lesions, in general, activate an angiogenic switch that both
increases the subepithelial microvasculature and produces stromal
inflammation (3, 4). Angiogenesis and inflammation are features
that could be exploited for imaging by a technique measuring
tissue vascularity and leakage, such as dynamic contrast enhanced
(DCE)–magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DCE-MRI, studied
extensively in solid malignancies (5–7), uses bolus contrast agent
administration to noninvasively visualize tumor microvasculature
and quantify leakage across microvessels (8, 9). Time-resolved
images, collected as contrast agent enters and exits tissue (10), are
pharmacokinetically modeled (11, 12), providing quantitative
measures of important physiologic parameters, such as tissue
microvascular integrity (vascular permeability).
Here, we used respiratory-gated MRI to obtain high-resolution
images of the entire mouse reproductive tract and delineated an
invasive squamous carcinoma in a late-stage (13–15), estrogentreated K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse. We also interrogated the
microvascular biology associated with premalignant dysplasia
using DCE-MRI with a 17-kDa contrast agent, Gadomer. No
differential dysplastic microvascular leak was detectable, consistent
with experiments showing undetectable physical leakage of an i.v.
injected marker protein, suggesting that dysplastic microvessels
have a maximal permeability pore size <17 kDa. However, DCE-MRI
detected a significant decrease in dysplastic vascular leak following
treatment with the antiangiogenesis agent, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) Trap (16, 17). Thus, DCE-MRI can serve as a
platform for noninvasively monitoring antiangiogenic drug efficacy,
potentially deployed with chemoprevention programs, for high-risk
premalignant disease.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice. One-month-old female K14-HPV16:FVB/n congenic
transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermate controls were treated for 3 or
6 months with s.c. insertion of 17h-estradiol pellets, 0.05 mg/60 day release
(Innovative Research of America; ‘‘estrogen’’; refs. 13, 15). The Animal
Studies Committee of Washington University in St. Louis approved all
procedures in this study.
MRI. MR images were collected on a Varian NMR Systems 4.7T INOVA
scanner described previously (18) using Stark Contrast 2.0 or 2.5 cm
birdcage RF coils. Mice were anesthetized and maintained on isoflurane/O2
(1–1.25% v/v), and a 3-inch length of PE-10 tubing (Becton Dickinson) was

inserted via the urethra into the bladder for drainage throughout data
collection. Core body temperature was maintained at 37 F 1jC by warm air
circulation through the magnet bore.
For anatomic imaging, 500 AL Omniscan (gadodiamide; GE Healthcare)
contrast agent, diluted 1:10 in saline to yield a 50 mmol/L solution, was
administered i.p. immediately before placing the animal into the magnet.
High-resolution images were collected using a respiratory-gated, twodimensional, multi-slice spin-echo sequence (18), and all images were
collected during post-expiratory periods. Imaging parameters were
repetition time f3 s, echo time 20 ms, field of view 2.5  2.5 cm2
(transaxial)/4.0  4.0 cm2 (coronal), 128  128 data points, and slice
thickness 0.5 mm.
DCE-MRI data were collected using a T1-weighted, gradient spoiled,
multi-slice gradient-echo sequence. Imaging parameters were flip angle
30j, repetition time 0.06 s, echo time 0.002 s, field of view 2.5  2.5 cm2,
number of slices 15, in-plane resolution 195 Am, and slice thickness
0.50 mm. The temporal resolution was f15 s. Early DCE-MRI data were
collected following i.v. injection of Omniscan. However, values of vascular
permeability (K trans) were all derived from experiments using Gadomer
(Bayer Schering Pharma). Pre-contrast, T1 maps were produced using a
variable flip-angle, three-dimensional, gradient-echo sequence (19, 20)
with flip angles of 2.5j, 5.0j, 7.5j, 10.0j, and 15.0j. After 1 min of
scanning ( four images at 15 s/image), 60 AL of a solution of Gadomer
that is 50 mmol/L Gd (a dose of 0.12 mmol Gd/kg body weight for a
25 g mouse) were injected over 10 s using a Harvard 2 dual syringe
pump (Harvard Clinical Technology) via either a tail or a jugular venous
catheter.
Modeling DCE data. The starting point for our analysis was the
Patlak model containing independent parameters v p ( fractional bloodplasma volume) and K trans (volume transfer constant between blood
plasma and extravascular extracellular space; refs. 21, 22). Significant
deviation from linearity in the Patlak plot led us to include a third
independent parameter, v e ( fractional volume of extravascular extracellular space), to account for contrast agent efflux from extravascular
extracellular space to blood plasma (21, 23). Conversion of signal
intensity to concentration of contrast agent was achieved by standard
methods (10). Negligible T2* weighting of the images and the fastexchange limit were both assumed (10, 12). Values of T10 were 1.6 s for
cervix (24) and 1.4 s for leg muscle (see below; ref. 25); r1 of Gadomer
was taken to be 9.1 mmol/L 1 s 1 (26).
The determination of v p, v e, and K trans requires knowledge of contrast
agent concentration in the blood plasma [arterial input function (AIF)]

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

throughout the experimental time course. Traditionally, the AIF is
measured from a large vessel within the image, carefully avoiding inflow
and partial volume artifacts (10, 27, 28). However, direct AIF
determinations in mice are often difficult due to small spatial
dimensions and motion effects. Instead, we derived the AIF from leg
muscle reference tissue (29, 30) using the following parameter values for
muscle tissue: K trans (Gadomer) = 0.002 min 1, v p = 0.021, and v e = 0.085
(31). To convert contrast agent concentration data into physiologic
parameters, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn over the transformation zone of the cervix and the data were modeled in Matlab
(Mathworks) using a variable projection (VARPRO) nonlinear leastsquares approach (32).
Detection of antiangiogenesis mediated by VEGF Trap. K14-HPV16
transgenic mice were scanned by DCE-MRI before treatment, treated
biweekly for 2 weeks with 500 Ag VEGF Trap (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals)
or vehicle (5 mmol/L phosphate, 5 mmol/L citrate, 100 mmol/L NaCl,
0.005% Tween 20) via i.p. injection, and then rescanned to test therapyassociated microvascular permeability alterations.
Determination of microvessel density. Isoflurane anesthetized mice
were i.v. injected with 50 Ag FITC-conjugated Lycopersicon esculentum lectin
(Vector Laboratories); after 3 min, the left ventricle was perfused with 10%
formalin (Fisher Scientific International) for 3 min followed by 10% sucrose
for 1 min (Perfusion One Rodent System; McCormick Scientific). The entire
reproductive tract was removed, and the vaginal cavity was filled with OCT
freezing medium, embedded in OCT (posterior-side down), flash-frozen
using liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC. Cryosections (60 Am) were
mounted using SlowFade Gold with 4¶,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and viewed under appropriate filter sets using an Olympus BX61
microscope equipped with a Fire Wire Colorview II camera (Olympus).
Images of lectin-perfused vessels in the cervical transformation zone taken
at 40 magnification were analyzed using Olympus MicroSuite Biological
Suite software. For each image, four equally sized rectangular ROIs were
identified along the epithelial-stromal border of the transformation zone.
Subepithelial microvasculature was delineated by creating RGB color
detection profiles to increase signal-to-noise and identify as many vessels as
possible. These profiles were used for all images.
Determination of physical molecular leakage. ChromPure sheep IgG,
Fc fragment, 50 Ag in 50 AL PBS (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories),
was injected i.v. and allowed to circulate for 2 h followed by FITC-lectin
injection, formalin perfusion, OCT whole-organ embedding, and 60 Am
cryosectioning as described above. Air-dried sections were rinsed in PBS
three times, blocked for 3 h with DAKO protein block, incubated overnight

(DAKO), and mounted using SlowFade Gold with 4¶,6-diamino-2-phenylindole. For visualizing Fc Fragment leakage, images were captured using the
Cy3 filter from the sample with the highest signal, which was used to
determine the optimal camera gain settings. A control image from a
noninjected mouse was used to correct for the Cy3 background signal. A
ROI obtained from the control image was used for background subtraction
for analysis of signal intensity of Fc-injected experimental tissue sections
using the MicroSuite software.
Statistical analysis. Data are mean F SD. Mann-Whitney U, paired or
unpaired Student’s t tests were used to determine statistical significance

Results
Cervical transformation zone MRI and histopathologic
correlation. First, we developed MRI techniques to visualize the
entire mouse female reproductive tract, including the vagina,
cervix, and lower uterus (Fig. 1B). High-resolution, in vivo
respiratory-gated spin-echo coronal and transaxial MR images
were obtained of a 3-month-old, estrogen-treated, nontransgenic
mouse with an in-plane resolution of 150 Am (Fig. 1A and C). The
coronal MR image (Fig. 1A) was a striking reproduction of the
actual organ anatomy delineating the cervical isthmus, canal, outer
cervix, and upper vagina (Fig. 1B). Transaxial images also
delineated all three zones of the cervix: the upper cervical-uterine
junction (data not shown), the mid-cervix with the transformation
zone and isthmus division septum leading to the two uterine horns
(Fig. 1C, top), and the lower cervix, here containing a single central
canal and laterally bounded by the adjacent vaginal walls (Fig. 1C,
middle), and the vagina (Fig. 1C, bottom).
Anatomic MRI also detected cervical cancer that occurs in 80%
of K14-HPV16 transgenic mice treated with estrogen for 6 months
(refs. 13, 15; Fig. 2A and B, multiple delineating black and red
arrowheads, respectively). The malignancy was first evident in the
mid-cervix both histologically and in the MRI (data not shown).
Histologic analysis further showed spread of the cancer to the
lower cervix, as determined by the single ‘‘X’’-shaped lumen
(Fig. 2A, green arrows indicate upper vagina), which invaded almost
through the anterior cervical wall adjacent to the bladder (Fig. 2A,
six o’clock position), and effaced the right portion of the cervical
canal. MRI delineated the same extent of tumor invasiveness
(Fig. 2B, red arrowheads), but with the additional feature of obliteration of the right cervical lumen, not evident on the histopathology
(Fig. 2A). This slight discordance of the MRI vis-à-vis histology is

due either to volume averaging in the former or, more likely, tissue
shrinkage during processing in the latter.
Differential histology and microvascular area in transgenic
premalignant high-grade dysplasia. As high-grade dysplasia,
usually arising from the cervical transformation zone, is the source
of subsequent invasive cervical cancer in both humans (1) and this
transgenic model (13) and is a potential target for chemoprevention, we focused our histopathologic (Fig. 3A-D), microvascular (Fig. 4A-D), and MRI analyses on this anatomic region and
this stage of progression in the transgenic mice treated with
estrogen for 3 months (13). Moderate to high-grade cervical
dysplasia (Fig. 3B and D), but no cervical cancer, was evident,
similar to our previous experience (13). Nontransgenic littermates
treated with the same dosage and duration of estrogen evidenced
hyperplasia without dysplasia (Fig. 3A and C).
Induction of angiogenesis and increased microvascularity has
been documented previously in patients with cervical dysplasia
and also in dysplastic skin lesions in K14-HPV16 transgenic mice
(33). Thus, we first determined differences in microvascular
morphology in transgenic cervical dysplasia (Fig. 4A, top and
bottom right) compared with nontransgenic estrogen-induced
hyperplasia (Fig. 4A, top and bottom left). There were two distinct
zones of microvasculature in the mouse cervix: the subepithelial
region and the deep stromal area (Fig. 4A, top left, white
arrowheads and arrow). The subepithelial region was most
affected by mouse genotype, with the transgenic microvasculature
forming tufts and projections into the overlying dysplastic
epithelium (Fig. 4A, top right, arrowhead , and higher-magnification image in bottom right). In contrast, nontransgenic microvasculature was flattened and linearly arrayed in the stroma
immediately beneath the hyperplastic epithelium (Fig. 4A, top
and bottom left). Image analysis revealed that the area of the
subepithelial microvasculature in K14-HPV16 mice was 42.6 F
8.8% compared with 24.3 F 8.5% in nontransgenic cervices (Fig.
4B). These data were similar to immunohistochemical analysis of
dysplastic microvessel density in this model (14).
Using DCE-MRI to detect vascular permeability changes in
premalignant cervical dysplasia. The increased subepithelial
microvascularity in 3-month-old, estrogen-treated transgenic
cervices led us to investigate microvessel biology using DCE-MRI,
particularly because K14-HPV16 transgenic mice were known to
accumulate activated stromal inflammatory cells that could, via
chemokine/cytokine release, induce leakage even in premalignant
dysplasia (14). Initially, we conducted these DCE-MRI experiments
using Omniscan, a low-molecular weight, Gd-based contrast agent.

Figure 3. Histopathology of mid- to high-grade
cervical dysplasia in estrogen-treated K14-HPV16
transgenic mice. Histologic images of
transformation zones in 3-month-old,
estrogen-treated nontransgenic (A and C ) and
transgenic (B and D ) mice. The sharp demarcation
of squamous with columnar epithelium in a
nontransgenic mouse (A and C, arrowheads )
contrasted with the squamous metaplasia of the
transgenic cervix extending into the lower
uterine horns (B ). Papillation of the dysplastic
transgenic epithelium was also evident
(B, arrowhead ). Mid- to high-grade dysplasia
contained mitotic, apoptotic, enlarged, and
anaplastic squamous epithelial cells (D, white
arrowhead in clockwise orientation).

Visual analysis of sequential temporal images from a DCE-MRI
experiment using a nontransgenic mouse revealed a distinct
pattern and distribution of Omniscan contrast agent over time
(Fig. 5A; Supplementary Movie). Initial pre-injection images were
dark (Fig. 5A, left). Immediately following injection, the pelvic
branches of the internal iliac artery were visualized; coincidently,
the luminal lining of the isthmus and cervical canal was brightly
enhanced (Fig. 5A, middle). This compartment was presumably the
subepithelial microvasculature. Finally, contrast was evenly distributed in the cervix, consistent with permeation throughout the
deep cervical stroma (Fig. 5A, right). We observed a swift, large
signal enhancement following Omniscan injection in both transgenic and nontransgenic animals, consistent with rapid extravasation, making it very difficult to collect high-resolution DCE-MRI
data rapidly enough for determination of contrast agent kinetics.
As such, we switched to Gadomer, a 17-kDa, dendrimer-based
contrast agent with permeability that was significantly lower than
that of Omniscan, for DCE-MRI. Following data collection, ROIs
were drawn in the cervical transformation zone (Fig. 5B, left) and
image intensity versus time curves were derived from within these
ROIs (Fig. 5C, left). Intensity versus time data were converted to
concentration versus time curves, and physiologic parameters were
derived, as described above. The red circles in Fig. 5C are

experimental data points, whereas the red curve represents the
modeling of this concentration versus time data using an AIF
derived from a reference tissue, muscle (refs. 29, 30; Fig. 5B, right). A
representative contrast agent concentration versus time curve for
muscle is plotted as the blue circles, whereas the derived AIF is
shown as the dashed blue curve (Fig. 5C, left). Based on our analysis
of the DCE data, we determined the transfer constant (K trans) for a
ROI within the cervical transformation zone in 32 transgenic and
17 nontransgenic mice (Fig. 5C, right). Average K trans values for the
nontransgenic (0.056 F 0.029 min 1) and transgenic mice (0.053 F
0.020 min 1) were indistinguishable.
To investigate the possibility of low-level microvascular leak to
which DCE-MRI was insensitive, we determined the physical
leakage (Fig. 5D). Injection of Fc fragments of 50-kDa molecular
weight showed a robust microvascular leakage both within an
invasive cancer (Fig. 5D, left) and within a dysplasia adjacent to the
malignancy (Fig. 5D, middle). In contrast, we did not detect
microvascular leak in dysplastic microvessels in 3-month-old,
estrogen-treated transgenic mice (Fig. 5D, right). Thus, despite a
2-fold increase in microvascular density (Fig. 4B), the switch to leaky
vessels occurred later in this model, possibly at the 4.5-month point
wherein carcinoma in situ and microinvasive cancer first appear (15),
or was restricted to frank invasive malignant lesions.

Anatomic response of microvasculature associated with
premalignant cervical dysplasia to antiangiogenic therapy.
Noninvasive detection of the response of dysplastic lesions to
antiangiogenic or antineoplastic therapies would be a tremendous
boon to assess efficacy of cancer prevention. We determined the
morphologic response of the transgenic cervical microvasculature
to VEGF Trap and then the sensitivity of DCE-MRI to detect
alterations of microvascular leakage. We used VEGF Trap (16, 17),
because VEGF has also been shown to be incrementally upregulated in both human dysplastic and malignant cervix (34) and
the cervical dysplasias and malignancies of estrogen-treated, K14HPV16 transgenic mice (14).
Following a 2-week course of VEGF Trap, there was an obvious
pruning of the epithelial tufting and a marked overall reduction in
microvascular density in the treated mice (Fig. 6A, vehicle, left,
and VEGF Trap–treated, right). Subepithelial microvascular area
decreased 50% in VEGF Trap–treated mice compared with vehicletreated transgenic mice (Fig. 6B), to a level below that of estrogentreated nontransgenic controls (Fig. 4B). Despite the marked
subepithelial microvascular pruning, there was no difference in the
extent or grade of epithelial dysplastic histopathology in VEGF Trap–
treated versus vehicle-treated transgenic mice (data not shown).
DCE-MRI detects antiangiogenic efficacy in premalignant
dysplasia. Next, we tested the ability of DCE-MRI to detect a
permeability response that potentially accompanied the VEGF
Trap–mediated decrease in microvascular area in cervical dysplasia. Pre- and post-VEGF Trap DCE-MRI showed a significant 63%
decrease in K trans in all of the treated transgenic mice (0.052 F
0.013 min 1 pretreatment versus 0.019 F 0.008 min 1 posttreatment; n = 6 mice; Fig. 6D). DCE-MRI data in vehicle control
transgenic mice were heterogeneous and bivariant (Fig. 6C), but all

values fell within the range that we previously determined for this
group (Fig. 5C, right). Overall, there was no statistical difference in
the pretreatment/post-treatment values either for each vehicletreated mouse in a paired Student’s t test (Fig. 6D) or within the
entire vehicle-treated group (0.048 F 0.015 min 1 baseline and
0.045 F 0.021 min 1 after 2 weeks; n = 5 mice). The uniformity of
K trans reduction in VEGF Trap–treated mice compared with the
variable response of vehicle-treated transgenic mice suggests that,
at a 17-kDa cutoff, DCE-MRI was detecting the marked reduction
in microvascular area in VEGF Trap–treated mice rather than an
inherent effect on the microvessel stability of neoplastic vessels.

Discussion
The estrogen-treated K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse model of
cervical carcinogenesis has been extensively studied since inception (14, 35–37), and its relevance for human disease has been
validated by both detailed histopathologic and genome-wide
expression analysis (15, 36, 38). Other work has shown angiogenesis
induction coincident with high-grade dysplasia, similar to our
findings (14). Moreover, dysplastic and malignant angiogenesis in
this model has been linked to both macrophage and neutrophil
expression of proteases and angiogenic factors (3, 14). Thus, the
emerging importance of the K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse as a
preclinical platform for testing drugs that target both malignant
and dysplastic angiogenesis (3, 14) motivated us to undertake a
detailed MRI-based analysis to both noninvasively determine
cervicovaginal anatomy and interrogate microvascular biology
associated with premalignant dysplasia.
Here, in vivo MRI at 4.7 T clearly distinguished epithelium and
subepithelial microvasculature from the relatively avascular deep

from nontransgenic (A, top and bottom left) and transgenic (A, top and bottom right ) mice revealed subepithelial and interior stromal microvascular compartments
(A, top left, arrowheads and arrow , respectively). Subepithelial microvessels were linearly arrayed in nontransgenic (NTG) mice, whereas they formed tufts
projecting into the neoplastic epithelium in transgenic mice (A, top right, arrowhead , and bottom ). Microvessel quantification (see Materials and Methods) revealed a
statistically significant increase in subepithelial microvascular density in the transgenic cervix (B).

cervical stroma and detected cervical cancers in transgenic mice.
The next challenge was determination of microvascular leak in
premalignant cervical dysplasia using DCE-MRI. DCE-MRI of the
lower female reproductive tract poses several unique data
acquisition and analysis challenges, including the relatively small
size of the target organs (only a few pixels in many images),
bladder proximity, and respiratory motion effects. Nonetheless,
we successfully determined the transfer constant (K trans),
describing vascular permeability/leak in the cervical transformation zone. Within each of these groups of animals, we observed
a wide range of K trans, although the average values for transgenic
and nontransgenic mice were indistinguishable. The DCE-MRI
data were supported, in part, by the lack of detection of
immunofluorescent analysis of Fc fragment leakage, although the
molecular mass of this protein (50 kDa) was larger than

Gadomer (17 kDa). Thus, the DCE-MRI data suggest that
microvessels associated with dysplastic lesions at the midpoint
of carcinogenic progression do not elaborate fenestrations or
other leakage-associated structures (39) despite their increased
density, abnormal morphology, and associated stromal inflammation (3, 4, 14).
In contrast, we were clearly able to detect and monitor the
decrease in cervical microvasculature due to VEGF Trap (16, 17) in
transgenic dysplasias. The antiangiogenic potency of VEGF Trap
was highlighted by the marked 50% reduction in K trans in VEGF
Trap–treated compared with vehicle-treated transgenic mice.
VEGF Trap also decreased dysplastic microvascular area to a level
that was 25% lower than the estrogen-treated nontransgenic
controls. These data suggested that VEGF was the predominant
coordinator of angiogenesis of cervical dysplasia despite the

post-contrast injection, and f15 min post-injection.
All other DCE-MRI data reported in this figure were
collected following i.v. injection of Gadomer (60 AL of a
solution that is 50 mmol/L Gd injected over 10 s).
ROIs drawn in the cervical transformation zone (B, left)
and in a reference muscle region (B, right ) were used to
derive the AIF. For a typical mouse, the cervical
transformation zone was defined by 30 to 50 pixels and
the muscle region by 2,400 to 3,000 pixels. Contrast
agent concentration versus time curves were
constructed for a cervical transformation zone ROI:
red circles, experimental data points; red curve, the
model (C, left). The reference contrast agent
concentration versus time curve for muscle, plotted with
blue circles , and the derived AIF, shown as the dashed
blue curve (C ). K trans values (C, right ) for a ROI within
the cervical transformation zone were statistically
indistinguishable. C, right, the horizontal line within each
box is the median value of K trans, the dot at the middle
of each box is the mean, the edges of the box are F1 SD,
and the whiskers are the maximum and minimum values.
Injection of sheep Fc fragment (50 kDa) and
immunofluorescent analysis showed leakage in a large
cervical cancer in a 6-month-old, estrogen-treated
transgenic mouse (D, left ), and adjacent dysplasia
(D, middle ), whereas leak was undetectable in the
3-month-old, estrogen-treated transgenic cervix
(D, right ).

MRI and Transgenic Cervical Carcinogenesis

Figure 6. Effect of VEGF Trap on the
transgenic cervical microvasculature.
VEGF Trap treatment of transgenic mice
produced a marked pruning of the cervical
microvasculature in VEGF Trap (A, right ),
compared with vehicle control transgenic
mice (A, left), with a statistically significant
decrease in subepithelial microvascular
area (B). DCE-MRI detected a significant
decrease in microvessel leakage within
VEGF Trap–treated transgenic mice (D )
compared with lack of significance
within the highly variant vehicle-treated
transgenic group (C ). *, P < 0.05,

Student’s t test (C and D ).

documented contribution of platelet-derived growth factor-C and
fibroblast growth factor-2 to this process in this model (4). These
data also highlighted a correlation between K trans and microvascular area within the 17-kDa pore size cutoff.
The lack of efficacy of VEGF Trap in ameliorating cervical
dysplasia, despite its pronounced microvascular potency, suggests
the need for combining antiangiogenic therapy with agents
targeting dysplastic epithelium as in clinical scenarios for
established malignancies (40). However, our study also highlights
the ability of DCE-MRI to potentially detect reduction in the
microvasculature that would likely accompany effective therapy for
dysplasia. As a prominent goal of future prevention therapies is
noninvasive ablation of high-risk dysplasia, DCE-MRI could
become a valuable monitoring tool for treatment efficacy.
