ABSTRACT
Cofilin is a member of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) family protein, which
plays an essential role in regulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis. It remains unclear
how cofilin regulates the mitochondrial apoptosis. Here, we report for the first time
that natural compound 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate (erucin) found in consumable
cruciferous vegetables induces mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in human breast
cancer cells through the mitochondrial translocation of cofilin. Importantly, cofilin
regulates erucin-induced mitochondrial fission by interacting with dynamin-related
protein (Drp1). Knockdown of cofilin or Drp1 markedly reduced erucin-mediated
mitochondrial translocation and interaction of cofilin and Drp1, mitochondrial
fission, and apoptosis. Only dephosphorylated cofilin (Ser 3) and Drp1 (Ser 637)
are translocated to the mitochondria. Cofilin S3E and Drp1 S637D mutants, which
mimick the phosphorylated forms, suppressed mitochondrial translocation, fission,
and apoptosis. Moreover, both dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of
cofilin and Drp1 are dependent on ROCK1 activation. In vivo findings confirmed that
erucin-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in a breast cancer cell xenograft mouse
model is associated with the mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and Drp1, fission
and apoptosis. Our study reveals a novel role of cofilin in regulation of mitochondrial
fission and suggests erucin as a potential drug for treatment of breast cancer.

characterized by the opening of their tubular junction. This
process results in the complete release of proapoptotic
factors, such as cytochrome c, which is required in the
cytosol for the activation of downstream effector caspases
[6]. A number of evidence revealed that dynamin-related
protein 1 (Drp1) participates in mitochondrial fission.
Drp1 is a GTPase that causes scission of the mitochondrial
outer membrane, resulting in fission of mitochondrial
tubules into fragments [7, 8]. Drp1 translocates from the
cytosol to the mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial
fission prior to caspase activation and apoptosis [9].
Drp1 is responsible for cytochrome c release and caspase

INTRODUCTION
Mitochondria are double membrane-bound
organelles found in most eukaryotic cells, where they play
essential and diverse roles in cellular physiology, including
growth, division, energy metabolism, and apoptosis [1–3].
Mitochondrial morphology is regulated by the balance of
two continuous antagonistic processes: fusion and fission
[4]. Under physiological conditions, mitochondria are
elongated and filamentous, but they undergo extensive
fragmentation during apoptosis [5]. Apoptotic fission
is associated with remodeling of the cristae, which is

activation [10]. However, the mechanism by which Drp1
is recruited to mitochondria remains unresolved.
Cofilin is a member of the ADF/cofilin family
of small actin-binding proteins found in all eukaryotic
cells, and it regulates actin dynamics by increasing the
rate of actin depolymerization and facilitating actin
filament turnover [11]. Cofilin plays an essential role in
regulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis [12]. Recent
findings indicate that after induction of apoptosis, cofilin
translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria prior
to the release of cytochrome c [12, 13]. Knockdown of
cofilin results in the inhibition of both cytochrome c release
and of apoptosis [12]. In addition, recent evidence has
implicated cofilin in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics
and functions [13]. Cofilin functions as a biosensor that
integrates cytoskeletal regulation with mitochondrial
function. The results of another study indicated that under
certain cellular conditions cofilin might directly or indirectly
associate with mitochondria and modulate mitochondrial
functions [14]. However, the mechanism by which cofilin
affects mitochondrial dynamics and functions, and is
responsible for mitochondrial apoptosis remains unknown.
Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase
1 (ROCK1) belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases
that are activated by Rho GTPases or caspase-3 via cleavage
the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain away from the kinase
active site [15, 16]. Recent studies have shown that ROCK1
plays an important role in regulation of apoptosis in various
cell types and animal disease models [16–18]. It has been
shown that ROCK1 plays a critical role in mitochondrial
fission, which results in recruitment of dynamin-related
protein-1 (Drp1) to the mitochondria [19]. ROCK1 has
also been shown to play a critical role in dephosphorylation
and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin [17]. However,
the precise mechanism by which ROCK1 regulates
the phosphorylation status of Drp1 and cofilin during
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis remains unclear.
The natural compound 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate
(erucin) is found in consumable cruciferous vegetables and
possesses chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities
[20]. Increasing evidence suggests that erucin exerts its
antiproliferative effects by inducing cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in various cancer cell lines in vitro [21, 22] and in
tumor xenograft models in vivo [23]. The results of recent
studies suggest that a mitochondrion-dependent pathway
may play an important role in erucin-mediated apoptosis
[24]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which erucin
regulates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in human
breast cancer cells has not yet been explored. Here, we report
for the first time that erucin potently induced mitochondrial
fission and apoptosis through mitochondrial translocation and
interaction of cofilin and Drp1. Importantly, Rho-associated
coiled coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) was found
to play an important role in regulating the dephosphorylation
of cofilin and Drp1. Our in vivo findings indicated that the
erucin-mediated inhibitory effects on tumor growth in a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model was also associated
with dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of
cofilin and Drp1, mitochondrial fission, and apoptosis. These
findings provide a novel mechanistic basis for the application
of erucin in the treatment of breast cancer.

RESULTS
Erucin induces apoptosis and mitochondrial
fission in human breast cancer cells
First, we examined the effects of erucin on apoptosis
and mitochondrial injury in human breast cancer MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry analysis
revealed that exposure of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
to erucin resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial
injury (loss of △Ψm) and apoptosis in dose- and timedependent manners (Fig. 1A and 1B). Consistent with
these findings, the same erucin concentrations and
exposure intervals caused cleavage and activation of
caspase 9 and caspase 3 and degradation of PARP. These
events were also accompanied by significant increases in
the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the
cytosol (Fig. 1C and 1D). Immunofluorescence assay also
revealed that cytochrome c was release from mitochondria
to cytosol after erucin treatment (Fig. 1E and 1F).
Mitochondrial fission is related to the initiation of
apoptosis [4, 12, 25], and therefore, we examined the effects
of erucin on mitochondrial fission in both MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 cells. Mitochondria were labeled by staining with the
mitochondrion-selective probe Mitotracker Red CMXRos.
Exposure of cells to erucin resulted in significant decreases
in the average length of mitochondria (Fig. 1E and  1F).
The electron microscopic studies revealed the increased
mitochondrial fragmentation, as evidenced by a significant
increase in small, punctate mitochondria in erucin-treated
cells compared with control cells, which exhibited elongated
filamentous mitochondria (Fig. 1G and 1H). Taken together,
these findings suggest that erucin induced mitochondrial
fission, leading to the release of cytochrome c from
mitochondria and cell death in human breast cancer cells.

Erucin induces translocation of cofilin and Drp1
from the cytosol to mitochondria
Recent evidence revealed that cofilin and Drp1 play
critical roles in regulation of mitochondrial function by
translocating from the cytosol to mitochondria [14, 17,
26–28]. We next investigated whether mitochondrial
translocation of cofilin and Drp1 is necessary for erucin
to induce mitochondrial fission. Treatment of cells
with erucin significantly increased the levels of cofilin
and Drp1 in mitochondria and decreased cofilin and
Drp1 levels in the cytosol in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to
further detect the sub-cellular localization of cofilin and

treated with erucin, cofilin and Drp1 signals were localized
at the mitochondria (Fig. 2B and 2C). Mitochondrial
fission was also observed following erucin treatment.
These findings suggest that translocation of cofilin and
Drp1 from the cytosol to the mitochondria is required for
erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission.

suggest that both cofilin and Drp1 are localized at the outer
mitochondrial membrane after erucin treatment.
Because both cofilin and Drp1 participate in
mitochondrial fission induced by erucin, we questioned
whether cofilin could interact with Drp1 in response to
erucin treatment in MDA-MB-231cells. Surprisingly,
immunoprecipitation assay indicated that cofilin and
Drp1 coimmunoprecipitated when cells were treated
with erucin (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, immunofluorescence
microscopic studies revealed a significant colocalization
of cofilin and Drp1 in cells treated with erucin (Fig. 3C).
Taken together, these findings indicate that the interaction
and colocalization of cofilin and Drp1 at the outer
mitochondrial membrane were essential for erucin-induced
mitochondrial fission.

Erucin induces the interaction and colocalization
of cofilin and Drp1 at the outer mitochondrial
membrane
To determine whether cofilin and Drp1 were localized
at the outer mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial
fractions from MDA-MB-231 cells were digested with
proteinase K as described previously [12], cofilin and Drp1
proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Both
mitochondrial cofilin and Drp1 induced by erucin were
digested completely by proteinase K, whereas Cyto c and
CoxIV, which are internal mitochondrial markers are not
digested by the protease treatment (Fig. 3A). These findings

approach was used to stably knockdown cofilin expression.
Knockdown of cofilin markedly reduced erucin-mediated
cofilin translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria
(Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation of the mitochondrial
fraction revealed that knockdown of cofilin markedly
reduced the interaction between cofilin and Drp1 mediated
by erucin (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of cofilin also reduced the
colocalization between cofilin and Drp1 induced by erucin
(Fig. 4C). Knockdown of cofilin significantly abrogated
erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission and resulted in
mitochondrial elongation (Fig. 4D and 4E). Moreover,
depletion of cofilin significantly abrogated erucinmediated cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation and
apoptosis (Fig. 4F–4H).

shRNA affected erucin-induced mitochondrial fission and
apoptosis. Infecting cells with Drp1 shRNA lentivirus
significantly reduced Drp1 expression and erucinmediated Drp1 translocation from the cytosol to the
mitochondria (Fig. 5A). Drp1 knockdown also markedly
reduced the interaction and colocalization between cofilin
and Drp1 mediated by erucin compared to that in control
shRNA cells (Fig. 5B and 5C). Knockdown of Drp1
inhibited erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission and
resulted in mitochondrial elongation (Fig. 5D and 5E).
Moreover, Drp1 suppression by shRNA significantly
abrogated erucin-mediated cytochrome c release, caspase
3 activation and apoptosis (Fig. 5F–5H).

at Ser 637 and Ser 616. Exposure of cells to erucin resulted
in significantly decrease in the levels of phospho-Drp1 at
Ser 637, but had no effect on phosphorylation of Drp1 at
Ser 616 (Fig. 6A). To further examine the role of Drp1 Ser
637 dephosphorylation in erucin-induced mitochondrial
fission and apoptosis, we generated a mutant of Drp1 Ser
637D (S637D) to mimic the constitutively phosphorylated
form or a mutant of Drp1 Ser 637A (S637A) to mimic the
dephosphorylated form. Overexpression of Drp1 S637A

Moreover, Drp1 S637A significantly increased, whereas
Drp1 S637D reduced, erucin-mediated cytochrome c release,

findings indicated that dephosphorylation of Drp1 Ser 637
is required for erucin-induced mitochondrial translocation of
Drp1, mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.

(Fig. 7F and 7G).
To further confirm these results, a lentivirus
shRNA approach was used to stably knockdown ROCK1
expression. Knockdown of ROCK1 significantly blocked
erucin-mediated dephosphorylation of cofilin (Ser 3)
and Drp1 (Ser 637) (Fig. 7H), Knockdown of ROCK1
also blocked erucin-mediated translocation of cofilin
and Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria (Fig. 7I).
ROCK1 suppression by shRNA significantly inhibited
erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission (Fig. 7J and 7K).
Furthermore, depletion of ROCK1 also significantly
decreased erucin-mediated cytochrome c release, caspase 3
activation and apoptosis (Fig. 7L and 7M). Taken together,
these findings indicated that activation of ROCK1 played
a critical role in erucin-mediated dephosphorylation
and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and Drp1,
mitochondrial fission, and apoptosis.

Erucin inhibits tumor growth in a MDA-MB-231
xenograft mouse model

ROCK1 is involved in erucin-induced
dephosphorylation and mitochondrial
translocation of cofilin and Drp1, mitochondrial
fission, and apoptosis

To determine whether our in vitro findings
could be replicated in vivo, nude mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with MDA-MB-231 cells followed by
injections with vehicle or erucin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 50
days starting one week after tumor inoculation. Treatment
with erucin resulted in a significant increase in survival
compared with untreated controls (P < 0.001) (Fig. 8A).
Treatment with erucin resulted in a significant suppression
of tumor growth after 3 weeks of drug exposure (P < 0.01
or P < 0.0001 vs vehicle control) (Fig. 8B). However, there
were no significant changes in body weight (Fig. 8C) or
other signs of potential toxicity such as agitation, impaired
movement and posture, indigestion or diarrhea.
To evaluate the effect of erucin on mitochondrial
dynamics in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft in vivo, we
used immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the
morphology of mitochondria in primary cells isolated
from the MDA-MB-231 xenograft in vehicle control or
erucin-treated mice. Following treatment with erucin,
mitochondria became short and fragmented, as evidenced
by a significant decrease in the average length of
mitochondria (Fig. 8D and 8E). Moreover, apoptosis and
Western blot analyses showed that treatment with erucin
significantly increased cytochrome c release, caspase 3
activation and apoptosis in primary cells isolated from the
MDA-MB-231 xenograft (Fig. 8F and 8G).
Western blot analysis was used to further evaluate
whether mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and Drp1
occurred during erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission
and apoptosis in primary cells. Cofilin and Drp1 were
found in mitochondrial fractions following treatment with
erucin, concomitant with the disappearance of cofilin
and Drp1 from cytosolic fractions (Fig. 8G). Thus, our
data indicated that mitochondrial translocation of cofilin

It has been shown that cofilin can be
dephosphorylated by the phosphatases PP1 and PP2A,
which are regulated by the ROCK1 signaling pathway
[17, 32–35], and phosphorylated by LIM kinase,
which is also regulated by ROCK1 [36–38]. ROCK1
is involved in the regulation of Drp1 phosphorylation
status and promote Drp1 translocation to mitochondria,
leading to mitochondrial fission [19]. We next examined
whether erucin affects the expression of ROCK1, PP1,
PP2A, LIMK1, LIMK2 and phospho-LIMK1(Thr508)/
LIMK2(Thr505). Treating cells with erucin resulted in a
marked decrease in the levels of ROCK1 and increased
cleavage of ROCK1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7A).
Exposure of cells to erucin also resulted in marked increase
in levels of PP1 and PP2A in time-dependent manners.
However, the levels of LIMK1, LIMK2 and phosphoLIMK1(Thr508)/LIMK2(Thr505) were not altered by
erucin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To further assess the functional significance of
ROCK1 activation in regulating the phosphorylation
status and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and
Drp1, a ROCK1 inhibitor Y-27632 was employed.
Pretreating cells with Y-27632 significantly decreased
erucin-mediated ROCK1 cleavage/activation and
dephosphorylation of cofilin (Ser 3) and Drp1 (Ser 637)
(Fig. 7B). Pretreatment with Y-27632 also markedly
decreased erucin-mediated translocation of cofilin
and Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria (Fig. 7C).
Y-27632 also significantly decreased erucin-induced
mitochondrial fission (Fig. 7D and 7E). Moreover,

was due primarily to the interaction and recruitment of
cofilin and Drp1 to mitochondria. Cofilin is a member of
the ADF/cofilin family, which regulates actin dynamics by
increasing the rate of actin depolymerization [11]. Recent
evidence has demonstrated that mitochondrial translocation
of cofilin induces the release of cytochrome c and
apoptosis in neutrophils and neuroblastoma and lymphoma
cells [12, 39]. However, the mechanism by which cofilin

showed that erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission and
apoptosis was accompanied by mitochondrial translocation
of cofilin. Knockdown of cofilin markedly reduced erucinmediated mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Thus, these
data suggest that mitochondrial translocation of cofilin
is crucial for erucin-mediated mitochondrial fission and
apoptosis.
The most interesting finding of the present study was
that the interaction and colocalization of cofilin and Drp1 at
mitochondria was involved in erucin-mediated mitochondrial
fission during apoptosis. The dynamin-related protein Drp1
is essential for most types of mitochondrial fission [26,
40]. Drp1 is a cytosolic GTPase that has been proposed to
couple GTP hydrolysis to membrane constriction and fission
[41]. Recent evidence has revealed that Drp1 translocates
to mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial fission [42].
Drp1 homo-oligomerizes and forms a ring around the
mitochondrial tubule [43]. Drp1 complexes might generate
mechanical force via conformational changes, leading to
membrane constriction and fission [44]. The role of cofilin
in erucin-mediated Drp1 recruitment and mitochondrial
fission is strongly supported by several lines of evidence.
First, both cofilin and Drp1 translocated from the cytosol to
mitochondria during erucin-induced mitochondrial fission.
Second, cofilin and Drp1 interacted and colocalized at the
outer mitochondrial membrane during erucin-mediated
mitochondrial fission. Third, knockdown of cofilin or Drp1
significantly blocked the interaction and colocalization
between cofilin and Drp1, mitochondrial fission and
apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report to demonstrate that the interaction and mitochondrial
translocation of cofilin and Drp1 are required for erucinmediated mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.
Here, we report that erucin-induced mitochondrial
fission depends on the phosphorylation status of cofilin and
Drp1. The regulation of cofilin involves the phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation of its Ser 3 residue; cofilin is
inhibited by phosphorylation [45] and translocates to
mitochondria only in its dephosphorylated (active) form
[12]. The dephosphorylated form of cofilin (S3A) promotes
oxidant-mediated mitochondrial damage and apoptosis
[39]. Consistent with these findings, our data indicate that
only dephosphorylated cofilin translocates to mitochondria.
Interestingly, we found that constitutively active cofilin
S3A (dephosphorylated) enhanced, whereas the dominantnegative cofilin S3E (phosphorylated) blocked, the
mitochondrial translocation of cofilin, mitochondrial fission
and apoptosis induced by erucin. Thus, erucin-mediated
dephosphorylation of cofilin at Ser 3 is required for the
translocation of cofilin to mitochondria and increased
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.
The dynamin-related protein Drp1 is essential for
most types of mitochondrial fission [4, 26]. The majority
of the available evidence has revealed that regulation of
Drp1 by post-translational modifications is important for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Drp1 translocation to mitochondria [46, 47]. It has been
reported that calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of
Drp1 at Ser 637 regulates its translocation to mitochondria
and subsequent mitochondrial fission [48]. The increased
dephosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser 637 regulates its
translocation to mitochondria and induces mitochondrial
fission, which leads to an increased response to apoptotic
stimuli [49–51]. However, another report demonstrated
that phosphorylation of Drp1 Ser 600 (corresponding to
Ser 637 in human) of mouse podocytes promotes Drp1
translocation to mitochondria and increases mitochondrial
fragmentation [19]. Our findings demonstrate that
dephosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser 637 regulates its
translocation to mitochondria and induces mitochondrial
fission in response to erucin based on the following
evidence. First, erucin induced dephosphorylation of
Drp1 at Ser 637 but not Ser 616. Second, overexpression
of Drp1 mutant S637A (dephosphomimetic) increased,
whereas Drp1 mutant S637D (phosphomimetic) reduced,
the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1, fission and
apoptosis. Thus, dephosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser 637
by erucin is required for the translocation of Drp1 to
mitochondria and increased mitochondrial fission and
apoptosis.
The present study demonstrated that activation of
ROCK1 was essential for dephosphorylation of cofilin
(Ser 3) and Drp1 (Ser 637), which promoted cofilin and
Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria and mitochondrial
fission. Recent studies have shown that ROCK1 plays an
important role in regulation of apoptosis in various cell
types [16, 17]. ROCK1 has diverse functional activities
in different cell types [18, 37]. ROCK1 activation can
regulate activation/dephosphorylation of cofilin by
induction of PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activities [17,
32], or control phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase
[36–38]. Our data indicate that erucin-induced ROCK1
activation and subsequent activation/dephosphorylation of
cofilin are mainly caused by increasing the PP1 and PP2A
phosphatase activities. The LIM kinase seems not to be
involved in this process. It has been shown that ROCK1
plays an important role in remodeling mitochondrial
morphology by regulating the phosphorylation and
mitochondria translocation of Drp1 in podocytes [19].
Our previous study showed that ROCK1 activation
plays a critical role in regulating cofilin mitochondrial
translocation and apoptosis in leukemia cells [17].
Our findings suggest that activation of ROCK1 plays
a critical role in erucin-mediated dephosphorylation
and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and Drp1,
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis, based on the
following evidence: (i) Erucin induced activation of
ROCK1 in a time-dependent manner; (ii) Inhibition of
ROCK1 activity by Y-27632 or knockdown of ROCK1
by shRNA attenuated erucin-mediated cofilin and Drp1
dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation;
(iii) Inhibition of ROCK1 activity by Y-27632 or
1845

knockdown of ROCK1 by shRNA significantly reduced
erucin-induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.
In summary, the present findings demonstrate
for the first time that erucin induces mitochondrial
fission and apoptosis in breast cancer cells through
mitochondrial translocation and interaction of cofilin
and Drp1. Collectively, these observations suggest a
hierarchy of events in erucin-induced apoptosis in which
ROCK1 activation represents the primary event, leading
to the dephosphorylation of cofilin (Ser 3) and Drp1
(Ser 637), which are translocated from the cytosol to
the mitochondria, culminating in mitochondrial fission,
cytochrome c release and apoptosis.

(n = 30 per group). One week after tumor inoculation,
the mice received either erucin (50 mg/kg, i.p., five
times per week) or an equal volume of vehicle. Signs of
potential toxicity, such as agitation, impaired movement
and posture, indigestion or diarrhea, and areas of redness
or swelling were observed during the treatment. Tumor
volume, body weight and survival time were measured
at various time intervals throughout the study. Tumor
volumes were calculated according to the formula (width2
