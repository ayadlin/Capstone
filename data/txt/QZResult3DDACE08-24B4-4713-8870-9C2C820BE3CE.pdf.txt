BACKGROUND: Targeting the tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis is a novel lymphoma therapeutic strategy.
The authors report safety, activity, and angiogenic profiling results with the rituximab and thalidomide plus prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, and cyclophosphamide (RT-PEPC) regimen in patients with recurrent mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). METHODS: RT-PEPC included induction (Months 1-3) of rituximab 4 times weekly, daily thalidomide
(50 mg), and PEPC followed by maintenance thalidomide (100 mg), oral PEPC titrated to the neutrophil count, and
rituximab every 4 months. Endpoints included safety, efficacy, quality of life (QoL), and translational studies, including tumor angiogenic phenotyping, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and circulating endothelial
cells. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and 22 were evaluable. The median age was 68 years (range,
52-81 years), 24 patients (96%) had stage III or IV disease, 18 patients (72%) had an International Prognostic Index
(IPI) score of 3 to 5, and 20 patients (80%) had high-risk Mantle Cell International Prognostic Index (MIPI) scores.
Patients had received a median of 2 previous therapies (range, 1-7 previous therapies), and 15 patients (60%) had
progressed on bortezomib. At a median follow-up of 38 months, the overall response rate was 73% (complete
response [CR]/unconfirmed CR rate, 32%; partial response [PR] rate, 41%; n ¼ 22 patients), and the median progression-free survival was 10 months. Four CRs were ongoing (6 months, 31 months, 48 months, and 50 months).
Toxicities included grade 1 and 2 fatigue, rash, neuropathy, and cytopenias, including grade 1 and 2 thrombocytopenia
(64%) and grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (64%). Two thromboses and 5 episodes of grade 3 or 4 infections occurred.
QoL was maintained or improved. Correlative studies demonstrated tumor autocrine angiogenic loop (expression of
VEGF A and VEGF receptor 1) and heightened angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in stroma. Plasma VEGF levels
and circulating endothelial cells trended down with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PEPC had significant and durable
activity in MCL with manageable toxicity and maintained QoL. Novel, low-intensity approaches warrant further evaluC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Original Article

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents 5% to 8%
of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and occurs primarily in the
elderly. The median failure-free survival for patients with
MCL is approximately 8 to 20 months with standard regimens,1-3 although high-intensity chemotherapy with or
without stem cell transplantation provides longer progression-free survival (PFS).4,5 The disease course is characterized by recurrences and by a reported median survival of
4 to 5 years.6
The management of recurrent MCL is limited by
age and comorbidities. Single agents, such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus, and the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, provide modest response
rates (22%-53%) with response durations of approximately 4.8 to 9.2 months.7-12 Without a curative option
in general, regimens that offer disease control with convenience and tolerability (to preserve quality of life) are
valuable to patients with MCL—particularly the elderly.
One strategy is represented by novel regimens, including
metronomic therapy, that target the tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis.
The prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, and cyclophosphamide (PEPC) metronomic regimen13 consists of
oral prednisone (20 mg), etoposide (50 mg), procarbazine
(50 mg), and cyclophosphamide (50 mg) administered
orally on a continuously schedule. In a retrospective analysis of 22 patients with recurrent MCL, we reported a
response rate of 82% (including a 46% complete response
[CR] rate) and a median time on therapy of 17 months.
Treatment was tolerated well, although precise characterization was limited by the retrospective assessment.13 We
hypothesized that the addition of another putative antiangiogenic agent (thalidomide) potentially could augment
therapy. The combination of rituximab and thalidomide
(RT) demonstrated activity in a pilot MCL study14 in
which 13 of 16 evaluable patients had responses (5 CRs, 8
partial responses [PRs]) and the median PFS was 20
months. However, toxicity mandated significant thalidomide dose reductions.
In this article, we report a prospective phase 2 study
of the RT-PEPC combination incorporating low-dose
thalidomide (50-100 mg) with assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of life in patients with recurrent and refractory MCL. Maintenance rituximab was incorporated
with an attempt to maximize response durations.15 Translational studies explored the angiogenic profiles of primary tumor cells and tumor vasculature and correlated
antiangiogenesis with clinical response by measuring both
2656

soluble and cellular markers of angiogenesis, including
plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
circulating endothelial cells (CECs).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients had confirmed MCL with t(11;14)(q13;q32)
translocation or cyclin D1 overexpression; recurrent or
persistent disease after at least 1 therapy, measurable disease, and a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 50% or
higher. They were required to have an absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) 1000 cells/lL, platelets 50,000 cells/
lL, total bilirubin and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),
and creatinine 2 times the ULN. Key exclusion criteria
included central nervous system lymphoma or human immunodeficiency virus, previous therapy or major surgery
within 3 weeks, and preexisting grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy.
Study Design
This study was approved by the Weill Cornell Medical
College Institutional Review Board. Written informed
consent was obtained from all study participants. RTPEPC therapy included an induction phase (Months 1-3)
of rituximab 4 times weekly during Month 1, daily thalidomide (50 mg during Months 1-2, then 100 mg after
Month 2), and daily PEPC with prednisone 20 mg, etoposide 50 mg, procarbazine 50 mg, and cyclophosphamide 50 mg. PEPC was held when the ANC dropped to
<2000 cells/lL and was restarted on an alternate-day or
fractionated weekly basis when the ANC returned to
2000 cells/lL. A maintenance phase (Month 4 until
progression) continued with daily thalidomide at 100 mg,
PEPC dosing titrated to an ANC >2000 cells/lL, and rituximab 4 times weekly every 4 months (Fig. 1). Daily aspirin 81 mg was initiated for thromboprophylaxis after 2
episodes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred.
Efficacy and Safety Assessments
Response criteria followed the guidelines reported by
Cheson et al.16 Toxicities were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Thalidomide was
dose-reduced or discontinued for persistent grade 3 or
greater neuropathy. During induction, patients were evaluated weekly during Month 1 and monthly during
Months 2 and 3 for toxicity assessment. Response

were used to compare the difference in means between
different time points.

Figure 1. The combined rituximab (R) with thalidomide (T)
plus prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, and cyclophosphamide (PEPC) treatment schedule is illustrated. Treatment was
comprised of induction and maintenance phases. Patients
received weekly rituximab 4 (Month 1), daily thalidomide at
a dose of 50 mg (Months 1 and 2; the dose subsequently was
escalated to 100 mg if it was tolerated after Month 2), and
daily PEPC with prednisone 20 mg, etoposide 50 mg, procarbazine 50 mg, and cyclophosphamide 50 mg during induction. PEPC was put on hold when the absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) dropped to <2000 cells/lL and was restarted
on an alternate day or fractionated weekly basis to maintain
an ANC 2000 cells/lL. A maintenance phase (Month 4 until
disease progression) was continued with daily thalidomide
50 mg to 100 mg, PEPC dosing titrated to an ANC 2000
cells/lL, and maintenance rituximab every 4 months.

Quality-of-Life Assessment
Quality-of-life (QoL) assessments were obtained with version 3 of the Functional Assessment of Cancer TherapyGeneral (FACT-G) instrument at baseline, every 2
months until Month 6, and every 6 months until disease
progression.17 The FACT-G questionnaires include 5
subscales (physical well being, social/family well being,
relationship with physician, emotional well being, and
functional well being). The sum of physical well being
and functional well being scores was defined as the modified Trial Outcome Index (TOI). An ANOVA was used
to compare the difference between mean QoL total scores
and the modified TOI for the different time points.
Angiogenesis Biomarker Studies
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis
of VEGF receptor expression on MCL B-cells

Baseline MCL B-cells were isolated from either
lymph nodes or peripheral blood (if it was involved by disease) using CD19-positive magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, Calif) and were subjected to RNA extraction
with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). The MCL cell
line Jeko-1 and CD19-selected, normal donor peripheral
B-cells were used for comparisons. Quantitative VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression analysis was performed with
Taqman expression assays for VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and
VEGFR-3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif).

measurement began at Month 3. During maintenance,
patients were evaluated every 3 months for the first year,
every 4 months to 6 months thereafter until disease
progression, and indefinitely for survival.

Immunohistochemistry

Statistical Analysis
Study endpoints included overall survival (OS) and PFS,
which were summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves, and
objective response (CR, unconfirmed CR [CRu], and
PR), which was summarized as an exact 95% confidence
interval (CI). The 2-year OS and PFS rates were calculated based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate response
status and risk factors associated with PFS. All analyses
were performed using the S-PLUS software package (version 8.0 for Windows; TIBCO Software, Palo Alto,
Calif). For correlative studies, statistical significance
between samples was analyzed using a 2-tailed t test. P values from pair-wise comparisons were adjusted using the
Bonferroni method. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs)

Frozen lymph node tissue was obtained at baseline
from 7 patients, and paraffin tissues were obtained from
10 patients for correlative studies. Frozen tissue sections
were stained with anti-VEGFR-1 (FB5; ImClone Inc.,
New York, NY), VEGFR-2 (1121; ImClone Inc.),
VEGFR-3 (3C5; ImClone Inc.), VEGF-A (VG1; Zymed,
South San Francisco, Calif), CD34 (QBEnd10; Dako,
Carpinteria, Calif), and Lyve-1 (Abcam, Boston, Mass).
Paraffin tissue sections were stained with anti-CD34,
a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) (1A4; Sigma Chemical
Company, St. Louis, Mo), and podoplanin (AngioBio
Company, Del Mar, Calif). Double staining was performed with the following antibodies: VEGFR-2/CD34,
VEGFR-2/VEGF-A, CD34/Lyve-1, a-SMA/CD34, and
CD34/podoplanin. All staining experiments included
positive and negative controls.

VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Blood samples were collected at baseline, monthly
for the first 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter
(until at least Month 6). Plasma VEGF was quantified
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
of circulating endothelial cells

Mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll-Paque
PLUS (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) gradient centrifugation from 10 mL of peripheral blood collected in ethylene diamine tetracetic acid tubes within 24 hours of blood
collection. CECs were labeled with peridinin chlorophyll
protein complex/anti-CD45, fluorescein isothiocyanate/
anti-CD31, phycoerythrin/anti-CD146, and allophycocyanin/anti-CD34 (all from BD Pharmingen, San Jose,
Calif). Appropriate isotype controls were included. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif). For each
flow reaction, 300,000 to 500,000 events were collected.
Because most mononuclear cells fell in the lymphocyte
gating after Ficoll gradient purification, the numbers of
CECs per lL were calculated as the absolute lymphocyte
count/lL  CECs/lymphocyte gate count.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition
Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and 22 of those
patients were assessable for response (3 patients were enrolled but received no therapy) (Table 1). The primary
analysis was performed using the 22 evaluable patients,
who had a median follow-up of 38 months based on the
Kaplan-Meier estimate. The median patient age was 68
years, 96% had stage III and IV disease, and 64% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Patients generally had unfavorable baseline International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores
(72% had IPI scores of 3-5) and Mantle Cell International
Prognostic Index (MIPI) scores (12% had MIPI intermediate-risk disease, and 80% had MIPI high-risk disease).
The median time from diagnosis was 2 years (range, 1-13
years), and patients had received a median of 2 previous
therapies (range, 1-7 previous therapies). Twenty-two
patients (88%) had received a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)-based regimen (mostly rituximab plus CHOP), and 15 patients
(60%) progressed after a previous bortezomib-containing

Figure 2 shows disease measurements in 2 responders.
The median time to response was 119 days (range,
76-692 days). At a median follow-up of 38 months, the
2-year OS rate was 45% (95% CI, 28%-76%), the 2-year
PFS rate was 24% (95% CI, 10%-56%), and the median
PFS was 10 months (95% CI, 5-23 months) (Fig. 3). No
IPI factors were correlated with OS or PFS in a multivariate Cox regression analysis, whereas the majority of
patients had high-risk MIPI scores. Response (CR/PR) to
RT-PEPC treatment was associated favorably with PFS
(hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.48; P < .002).
Response to a previous regimen trended toward a correlation with response to RT-PEPC, although the trend was
not statistically significant (P ¼ .07).
Six patients remain on study. Four patients had
durable responses with 3 ongoing CRs at 50 months,
48 months, and 31 months and with 1 PR at 43
months. Of 16 patients who discontinued treatment, 10
patients died, 1 patient went to hospice, 3 patients
received additional treatment, and 2 patients successfully
underwent stem cell mobilization and consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation while in clinical response
(1 CR and 1 PR).
Toxicities
Therapy generally was well tolerated. By design, the primary toxicity was reversible myelosuppression. Grade 3 or
4 neutropenia occurred in 14 patients (64%), including 3
patients who had febrile neutropenia. Other grade 3 or 4
hematologic toxicities included anemia (5% of patients)

and thrombocytopenia (18% of patients) (Table 3). Nonhematologic toxicity generally was mild and consisted
mainly of grade 1 or 2 events, including fatigue (100% of
patients), constipation (64% of patients), cough (64%
of patients), nausea (59% of patients), neuropathy (59%
of patients), dyspnea (50% of patients), and rash (45% of
patients). Five patients (23%) developed grade 3 infections. One patient each had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and cytomegalovirus retinitis. Thrombosis
developed in 3 patients with 2 episodes of DVT/pulmonary embolism and 1 transient ischemic attack before the
institution of thromboprophylaxis with aspirin. One episode of early myelodysplasia (bone marrow aspirate morphology only with normal cytogenetics and blast count)
occurred in a patient who had received previous high-dose
therapy and stem cell transplantation. She subsequently
underwent reduced-intensity, matched, related donor
allogeneic stem cell transplantation and has remained in
CR. No long-term hematologic toxicity or bone marrow
dysfunction occurred in other patients.
QoL Assessment
Responders generally reported sustained or improved
QoL, whereas nonresponders reported worsening status
related to progression. At baseline, the mean (standard
deviation) total FACT-G score was 83.3  18.8, and the
modified TOI was 38.7  13.6). The mean baseline
FACT-G scores did not correlate with IPI scores or with
clinical responses to RT-PEPC. In 4 long-term responders

unchanged (total FACT-G score, 89.4  5.5 [P ¼ .16];
TOI, 43.5  3.5 [P ¼ .27]) during treatment (Fig. 4).
Angiogenesis Biomarker Results
Angiogenesis biomarkers were analyzed on the available
pretreatment tissue specimens to assess tumor cells and
the vascular microenvironment. In addition, dynamic levels of plasma VEGF and CECs at baseline and during
therapy were measured and correlated with response in a
subset of patients with available specimens.
VEGFR expression

VEGFR-1 expression was detected consistently
by immunohistochemistry on the surface of neoplastic
B-cells in addition to neovasculature (Fig. 5A1-A2).
VEGFR-1 expression in primary MCL B-cells was higher
than that in the MCL cell line Jeko-1 or in normal donor
B-cells according to real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 5A3)
(P ¼ .02). VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 expression on MCL
B-cells could not be demonstrated.

Vascular stroma profiling

Stromal angiogenesis was assessed using blood vascular and perivascular markers, including VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, CD34, and a-SMA, as well as lymphatic vascular markers of VEGFR-3, podoplanin, and Lyve-1. In addition to VEGFR-1, tumor neovessels were marked by
VEGFR-2 and CD34. The majority of CD34-positive tumor endothelial cells coexpressed VEGFR-2. Tumor B-cells
expressed VEGF-A in a paracrine fashion in relation to
VEGFR-2-positive tumor endothelia (Fig. 5B1-B3). Most
CD34-positive tumor microvessels were ensheathed by
a-SMA-positive pericytes (data not shown). Evident in the
tumor-infiltrating sinus zone was significant lymphangiogenesis activity marked by VEGFR-3-positive, podoplaninpositive, and Lyve-1-positive lymphatic vessels, some of
which coexpressed CD34 (Fig. 5C1-C3). The heightened
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in MCL implicated
their role in promoting lymphoma growth and spread.
Plasma VEGF

The median baseline plasma VEGF level (N ¼ 20)
was 109.5 pg/mL (range, 7-319 pg/mL; n ¼ 20)

compared with 68.2 pg/mL (range, 8-98 pg/mL; n ¼ 5)
in normal controls. There were no statistically significant
differences between responders and nonresponders (100.5
pg/mL vs 155.9 pg/mL, respectively; P ¼ .44), although
the median VEGF level trended higher in nonresponders.
Thirteen patients (11 responders and 2 nonresponders
with SD) had consecutive samples obtained during therapy that were analyzed in an exploratory fashion to correlate levels with clinical responses. Although the trend was
not statistically significant, median VEGF levels trended
down with time during treatment in both responders and
nonresponders (Fig. 6A). At 3 months, 62% of the 13
patients had a reduction in plasma VEGF, whereas 38%
had an increase.
Circulating endothelial cells

Total CECs, defined as CD45-negative, CD146positive, CD31-positive, CD34-positive cells, were

during treatment. The median baseline CEC level was
47.9 cells/mL (range, 4.7-254.3 cells/mL). At Month 1,
8 of 10 patients had an increase in CECs, whereas 2
patients had a decrease. Compared with baseline CECs,
median CECs at Month 1 trended up, although the
trend was not statistically significant, and then trended
down after Month 2 (Fig. 6B). No significant differences in median CEC values were detected between responders and nonresponders.

DISCUSSION
In this article, we report the first prospective study to our
knowledge evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral, lowdose, metronomic PEPC chemotherapy with RT in
patients with recurrent MCL. In MCL, angiogenesis is
increased in the tumor microenvironment, and we combined 2 putative antiangiogenic regimens, namely, PEPC
oral chemotherapy13 and rituximab with thalidomide.14
This study was novel in several important aspects: We
prospectively combined these regimens, assessed QoL,
and explored a putative mechanism of action (antiangiogenesis). In addition, we used a lower, more tolerable dose
of thalidomide compared with the previously used RT
regimen.14 The ultimate clinical objective of this study
was to develop a novel, low-intensity treatment regimen
that could produce durable responses with preservation of
QoL, particularly for elderly patients. The RT-PEPC regimen compared favorably in efficacy and tolerability with

data reported from alternative treatment strategies in this
patient population.7-12,15
Patients in the current study generally had unfavorable baseline IPI scores (72% had IPI scores of 3-5) and
MIPI scores (12% had intermediate-risk MIPI scores, and
80% had high-risk MIPI scores) in addition to other clinical features typical for MCL, including predominantly elderly patients (median age, 68 years) with advanced-stage
diseases. Most had progressive disease on bortezomib,
which is the only agent that has been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration in this setting. Compared
with immediate previous therapies, 70% of nonprogressors (including CR þ PR þ SD) achieved longer PFS on
RT-PEPC, and 45% had better response quality (ie, from
previous PD or SD to either a PR or a CR on RT-PEPC).
Durable responses generally occurred in complete res-

ponders. Most patients eventually would be maintained
on PEPC dosing once or twice weekly and thalidomide
dosing of 50 mg to 100 mg daily. Treatment was convenient (at home except for rituximab) and was tolerated
well, as reflected by QoL.
Both metronomic therapy and thalidomide putatively target tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis.18,19 Metronomic therapy has broad applicability in
lymphoma, including refractory disease.13,20,21 It is
believed that the principal targets of metronomic therapy
are the endothelial cells of the growing tumor vasculature.
In addition, it has been demonstrated that metronomic
therapy suppresses the surge of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell mobilization after conventional
‘‘maximal tolerated dose’’ therapy.22,23 Metronomic
chemotherapy can be combined with new compounds to

Figure 6. These are individual profiles of (A) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and (B) total circulating endothelial cells (CECs) over time. The individual time course of

augment antiangiogenic effects, as in the RT-PEPC
combination. In recurrent breast cancer24 and aggressive
non-Hodgkin lymphoma,21 responses to metronomic
regimens appeared to be associated with overall declining
levels of CECs and an increased fraction of apoptotic endothelial cells. We explored the correlation between
angiogenesis biomarkers and clinical responses in a subset
of our study patients. Although we were limited by sample
size, nonresponders appeared to have higher baseline
VEGF levels, and plasma VEGF levels generally trended
down with therapy in both responders and nonresponders. Our data also indicate that CECs declined in response
to treatment in both responders and nonresponders. A
nonstatistically significant increase in total CECs was
noted at Month 1 for 80% of the sample. Because we did
not differentiate total CECs from apoptotic CECs, it is
possible that this may represent a temporary increase in
apoptotic CECs as a result of the treatment. The declining
trend of both plasma VEGF and CECs levels in response

to therapy may reflect a potential antiangiogenic effect of
the RT-PEPC regimen with the caveat that disease in
nonresponders may have developed resistance through alternative mechanisms. Further investigations with larger
sample sizes will be needed in trials of conventional or
antiangiogenic treatment strategies to better define the
prognostic significance of these angiogenesis biomarkers.
Although the precise role of tumor angiogenesis in
MCL pathogenesis remains under active investigation,
our exploratory correlative study data indicate that MCL
has increased angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with the Southwest Oncology Group
S0108 trial,25 we detected VEGFR-1 over expression in
MCL B-cells compared with normal B-cells. VEGFR-1
expression promotes leukemic proliferation in an autocrine fashion and through extramedullary metastasis.26
The universal expression of VEGFR-1 in primary MCL
cells suggests a role in MCL proliferation and extranodal
metastasis. We also demonstrated that VEGFR-2 and
VEGFR-3 were expressed primarily in a paracrine fashion
by CD34-positive neovascular blood and lymphatic vessels in relation to VEGF-A-producing lymphoma cells,
implicating heightened angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in MCL. The presence of both an autocrine loop
through VEGF and VEGFR-1 expression on MCL tumor
cells and a paracrine loop between tumor VEGF and neovascular VEGFR-2 supports the strategy of targeting
VEGF in MCL. Like in solid tumors, single-agent bevacizumab has limited activity in MCL,25 and current
approaches involving bevacizumab in combination are
under evaluation in MCL and other lymphomas. Other
agents that target angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
pathways also are in development, and our data indicate
their potential utility in MCL.
The RT-PEPC regimen offers significant and durable
clinical activity in patients with MCL while maintaining
QoL, in part by targeting lymphoma microenvironment
and angiogenesis. This approach compares favorably to
other regimens for recurrent MCL. Novel, low-intensity
antiangiogenic approaches warrant further evaluation in
MCL and other lymphomas, either as part of a chronic
maintenance treatment strategy or as initial therapy in
elderly patients.
