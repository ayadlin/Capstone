MET-Mediated Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors: An Old Liaison
Rooted in Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells
Carla Boccaccio1,2, Paolo Luraghi1, and Paolo M. Comoglio1,2

Abstract
Inhibitors of EGFR are currently approved for the therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer (as well as other
tumors), but their beneﬁts are limited by inherent and acquired resistance, whose mechanisms are the subject of
intense investigation. It is known that such resistance relies on a handful of genetic lesions and/or extracellular
signals bypassing the requirement of EGF for cell proliferation and survival. As recently shown, these mechanisms
may imply oncogenic activation of MET or its stimulation by the ligand hepatocyte growth factor. However, it is
still largely obscure if sensitivity or resistance to EGFR inhibitors operates in cancer stem cells. Convincing
evidence indicates that this elusive cell subpopulation is present at the roots of colorectal cancer. Conceivably,
cancer stem cells accumulate the genetic lesions driving tumor onset and progression, as well as the genetic
determinants of sensitivity or resistance to conventional and targeted therapies. Recent studies enlighten the
expression of functional EGFR and MET in colorectal cancer stem cells and the outcome of their inhibition.
Evidence is provided that, in patients sensitive to EGFR therapy, association of MET inhibitors fosters cancer stem
cell eradication and durable tumor regression. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3647–51. Ó2014 AACR.

EGFR Is a Therapeutic Target in Colorectal
Cancer
Targeted therapies are usually effective when they hit the
product of an activated oncogene that plays an indispensable
role in cell proliferation and survival, thereby sustaining the socalled "oncogene addiction" (1). However, this rule has apparent exceptions. Colorectal cancer is an example, where antibodies targeting EGFR offer clinical beneﬁts even in the
presence of a wild-type receptor (2, 3). This beneﬁt is explained,
at least in part, by the observation that EGFR signaling is
crucial for homeostasis of intestinal stem cells, the putative
origin of colorectal cancer (4, 5). However, colorectal cancer is
frequently resistant to EGFR therapy, often as a result of
genetic lesions that constitutively activate signal transduction
pathways downstream EGFR, namely the RAS–ERK and PI3K–
AKT pathways, controlling cell proliferation and survival.
Direct stimulation of these pathways by activated oncogenes
affords a "bypass track"—or compensatory signaling mechanism—that subtracts cell proliferation and survival from EGFR
control, making EGFR inhibition ineffective (2). Such a resistance can manifest ab initio ("intrinsic" or "primary" resistance)
or after the selective pressure imposed on tumor subclones by

EGFR therapy itself ("acquired" or "secondary" resistance). It is
not surprising that the same oncogene can be the protagonist
of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR therapy, as it
was shown in the case of RAS (6–8) or ERBB2 (9, 10). The same
could occur for other genes implied in resistance such as
PIK3CA (11), BRAF, PTEN (12), and MET (13).

MET Activation Is a Mechanism of Resistance to
EGFR Inhibition
The MET oncogene, encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor
for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; ref. 14), was ﬁrst recognized as a factor of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung
cancers driven by EGFR mutations. Ampliﬁcation of this
oncogene was found in 20% of patients that developed
acquired resistance to the selective EGFR kinase inhibitor
geﬁtinib (15, 16). In experimental settings, MET ampliﬁcation
emerged concomitantly with resistance in an "EGFR-addicted"
cell line treated with increasing concentration of geﬁtinib. In
these cells, MET was shown to reactivate the proliferative/
antiapoptotic MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT pathways, quenched
by the inhibitor, thereby conferring bypass track resistance
(15). These studies also provided the proof of principle that the
combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors could be beneﬁcial
in lung cancers driven by EGFR mutations (15, 16). Interestingly, later, it was shown that rare subclones harboring MET
ampliﬁcation may pre-exist in EGFR-mutated lung cancers.
These subclones are not driven by EGFR mutations and thus
are positively selected by therapy with EGFR inhibitors (17).
The ﬁnding that MET ampliﬁcation (or another genetic
alteration, ref. 3) confers acquired resistance to EGFR therapy
links the concept of resistance to the presence of a cellautonomous, selectable genetic lesion, mirroring the

mechanism of oncogene addiction. On the other hand, sensitivity to targeted therapy may rely on the normal activity of an
essential pathway—such as the one downstream EGFR in
colorectal cancer—and refractoriness may be sustained by
physiologic, inherent signaling circuits. Indeed, it has recently
emerged that resistance to targeted therapies may be sustained
by growth-promoting cues coming from the tumor microenvironment. As an example, in cancer cell lines addicted to
mutationally active kinases, the response to speciﬁc inhibitors
was efﬁciently counteracted by a variety of growth factors (18–
20). In this context, among the many factors screened, HGF
displayed a prominent role in protecting BRAF-mutant melanomas or ERBB2-driven carcinomas from their respective
inhibitors (18, 19). Consistently, an association between high
levels of HGF expression and resistance to kinase-targeting
agents was found also in bioptical samples of BRAF-mutant
melanomas (18,19). Again, in an experimental setting, HGF,
EGF, and FGF were shown to reciprocally rescue cells from
inhibition of their respective receptors (20), a compensation
mechanism that may be critical for resistance of colorectal
cancer stem cells to targeting agents (see below).
The speciﬁc role of HGF in sustaining resistance to EGFR
inhibition was ﬁrst shown in lung adenocarcinomas driven by
EGFR mutations (17, 21). Lately, it was shown that HGF
protects colorectal cancer cells from inhibition of wild-type
EGFR (13, 22, 23). Recently, by analyzing microarrays of colorectal tumors treated with an anti-EGFR antibody as monotherapy, a correlation between increased expression of HGF
and poor therapeutic response was highlighted (24, 25).
As MET is widely expressed in human tumors (14), and HGF
is abundantly produced by cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (26,
27), activation of the wild-type receptor by its ligand may have a
widespread role, sustaining both biologic aggressiveness and
protection from antibodies or drugs targeting kinases, EGFR in
particular. So far, however, the contribution of HGF may have
been underestimated in the experimental setting, for a limitation inherent in cancer cell xenografting: murine HGF does
not efﬁciently cross-react with human MET (28, 29).

Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells: The Root of the
Tumor Resistance to Therapy
Colorectal tumors contain cells endowed with heterogeneous
tumorigenic potential (30, 31). Indeed, different cell subpopulations were isolated from whole tumors by cell surface markers
and cell sorting: only a minor cell subset displayed the distinctive properties of "cancer stem cells" such as (i) to generate a
xenograft that phenocopies the original tumor, (ii) to self-renew
in vivo, that is to sustain serial passages of xenografting, and
(iii) to give rise to a progeny that, although proliferating, can
not establish or propagate a xenografted tumor (30).
From colorectal tumors, it was also possible to isolate cells—
retaining the above properties—which were not prospectively
isolated through cell surface markers, but were selected in a
stem cell culture medium (25, 32). This methodology generated
the so-called "colospheres": spheroid colonies growing in suspension, each virtually clonal, and originated by cells with stem
properties. As they were not prospectively isolated by cell

3648

surface markers, such cells should be more appropriately
referred to as "cancer-initiating cells" (C-IC; refs. 30, 32).
It is debated whether cancer stem cells (or C-IC) are ﬁxed
entities, or represent a transient functional status, and if there
is interconversion between the nonstem and the stem status; if
so, it is unclear which extracellular cues could mediate such
interconversion (30). Interestingly, among a few hints, it has
been shown that induction of the so-called "epithelial–mesenchymal transition" by exogenous signals reprograms cells to
reactivate latent stem properties (33). HGF, also known as
"scatter factor," is a well-known inducer of cell dissemination
and invasive growth, a complex process starting with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (14, 34). Moreover, HGF induces
Wnt signaling in colorectal C-IC (35). These features whisper
that HGF sustains the cancer stem cell phenotype, as envisioned by considering the role of its receptor MET during
development and tissue regeneration (36).
At present, the dilemma about the "stem status" (ﬁxed vs.
transitory and interchangeable) is largely unresolved, and the
"cancer stem cell model" is burdened with controversy on the
relative extent of the stem cell subpopulation in individual
tumors (30). However, whatever the outcome of the arguments,
the relevance of stem cells in cancer therapy is increasingly
evident. It is quite established that cancer cells obeying to the
operational deﬁnition of "stem cells" are highly resistant to
conventional therapies, and thus are the most likely cause of
tumor recurrence (30). In colorectal C-IC, chemoresistance has
been associated with the activity of autocrine IL4 (37), or the
paracrine stimulation by IL17A, a factor that promotes also
self-renewal (38), or the activity of transcription factors ID1
and ID3, critical for sustaining the stem phenotype (32).
Altogether, these data support the conclusion that "determinants of stemness" deeply contribute to therapeutic resistance
(30) and enhance the interest in the stemness promoting
activity of HGF as a cause of failure of conventional and
targeted therapy.

EGFR: A Master Regulator of Colorectal Cancer
Stem Cells
In cancer stem cells, the role of EGFR and MET signaling is
largely obscure, as well as the outcome of their targeted
inhibition. To shed light on these issues, we systematically
isolated C-IC from a previously established ample cohort of
patient-derived xenografts of metastatic colorectal cancer
("xenopatients"). These xenografts were validated as faithful
representatives of the original tumors, able to retain their
genetic and phenotypic features across multiple serial passages, and displaying a therapeutic response to EGFR inhibitors comparable with that of matched patients, and correlated
with the genotype (9). As expected, mutations in genes encoding signal transducers of the RAS pathway conferred primary
resistance. Moreover, this xenopatient cohort was used to
perform population-based studies, resulting in the identiﬁcation of two new mechanisms of resistance to therapy with
the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab: ERBB2 ampliﬁcation
(for primary resistance; ref. 9) and MET ampliﬁcation (for
acquired resistance; ref. 13). Colospheres were generated from

sufﬁcient to fully prevent proliferation and survival. However,
when the same cells were cultured in a medium produced by
cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts, secreting a plethora of cytokines
and growth factors, and mimicking the tumor microenvironment (27), a strong inherent resistance to EGFR inhibition
became evident (25).

xenopatient tumors by culture in stem cell–selective medium.
These cells, for brevity called "xenospheres," displayed the
operational properties of C-IC (see above). Indeed, xenospheres long-term self-propagated in vitro and generated
phenocopies of the original tumors after transplantation in
mice ("spheropatients"; Fig. 1). Notably, xenospheres retained
the most essential property of C-IC, as they could be rederived
from the spheropatient and sustain serial transplantation.
Finally, the matched human patient, xenopatient, xenosphere,
and spheropatient retained the genetic determinants of response to anti-EGFR therapy. Altogether, these ﬁndings provide
a proof of concept that therapeutic sensitivity/resistance of
colorectal cancer to EGFR inhibitors resides in C-IC (25).
In the majority of colorectal C-IC, isolated as xenospheres,
EGFR was highly expressed. However, those harboring RAS
mutations (RASmut) were completely autonomous in their
growth, insensitive to EGF, and refractory to EGFR inhibitors
(even when cultured in the presence of EGF). This conﬁrmed
that, in colorectal C-IC, RAS constitutive activation sustains a
bypass track compensatory mechanism of cell proliferation
and survival. On the contrary, xenospheres harboring wild-type
RAS pathway genes and normal ERBB2 gene copy number (for
brevity referred to as RASwt) displayed strong dependence on
EGF for their growth and survival, and, in some cases,
expressed autocrine loops of EGFR ligands. As expected, when
RASwt xenospheres were grown in the presence of exogenous
or autocrine EGF as the sole growth factor, cetuximab was

MET: A Dangerous Coregulator of Colorectal
Cancer Stem Cells
Among factors produced by cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts,
HGF is prominent (25, 27). Its receptor MET was widely
expressed, at high levels, in all xenospheres, and, unlike EGFR,
was mostly downregulated when cells were cultured in prodifferentiating conditions. This observation strongly associates
MET functions with the stem/progenitor status. When RASwt
xenospheres were cultured in the medium produced by cancerassociated ﬁbroblasts, in spite of the presence of multiple
growth factors, MET inhibition was sufﬁcient to abolish proliferation, survival, and the underlying RAS/ERK and PI3K/
AKT signaling. On the contrary, in the same setting, EGFR
inhibition was ineffective (25). These results prompted us to
reconsider the importance of MET inhibitors for colorectal
cancer therapy. Indeed, previous preclinical models, based on
xenografts in regular NOD/SCID mice, failed to show a
response to MET inhibitors (39). However, as mentioned (see
above), dependence of HGF is difﬁcult to assess in the mouse,

(xenopatient, 2). From these
xenografts, cancer-initiating cells
(cancer stem cells) are selected
and expanded in stem cell medium
(xenospheres, 3). After
transplantation in mice
(spheropatient, 4), these cells
generate tumors that faithfully
retain the genotypic and
phenotypic features of the original
tissues. Xenospheres provide an
in vitro model to identify the cellautonomous and non–cellautonomous determinants of
sensitivity and resistance to
therapies that cannot be fully
elucidated in vivo. Both
xenospheres (5) and the recipient
mice (6) are amenable to genetic
manipulation so as to assess
experimental hypothesis.

because murine HGF does not efﬁciently cross-react with
human MET expressed by colorectal C-IC. Thus, a preclinical
model was set up to ensure the presence of human HGF, either
by inducing an HGF autocrine loop in xenospheres or by
transplanting xenospheres in a genetically engineered NOD/
SCID mouse, where the endogenous gene was replaced by the
human HGF gene. In this setting, the superior efﬁcacy of the
combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors for the therapy of
RASwt tumors was striking. Interestingly, this combination
treatment was accompanied by signs of stem cell marker loss
and increased tumor differentiation (25).

Studying the Therapeutic Response at Cancer
Stem Cell Level: Opportunities and Pitfalls
To date, a major limitation to study the therapeutic response
of cancer stem cells has been the lack of integration between
genomic and functional traits (30). We can now move ahead
and bridge the gap by isolating cancer stem cells (or C-IC) from
individual tumors, by validating the correspondence between
the genetic proﬁle of the original tumor and the stem cell
derivatives, and by studying in this setting the mechanism of
sensitivity or resistance to targeted therapies.
In the past, cell lines have been invaluable for identifying and
validating targets for cancer therapy, but C-IC growing in
cultures may open a new era of discovery, as they more
faithfully retain the genetic make-up of the original tumor
(40). This is essential when assessing the mechanisms of
intrinsic and acquired resistance, which often depend on
cell-autonomous–speciﬁc genetic lesions. Besides the conceptual implications, the practical value of C-IC in vitro cultures
resides in their property to indeﬁnitely propagate while retaining a remarkable genetic stability. This value is independent of
the deﬁnition of "cancer stem cells," a concept still controversial and suffering from prejudicial interpretation that leaves
uncomfortable many researchers working at the interface
between bench and bed. Of course, drawbacks exist, ﬁrst of
all the cumbersome technology for isolating stem cells from
human tumors. However, the improvement of platforms of
patient-derived xenopatients—feasible for the majority of
tumors—may signiﬁcantly increase the efﬁciency of cell
derivation.
By characterizing cancer stem cells in vitro, the interplay
between the genetic make-up and the signaling circuits inherently operating in these cells can be recognized. Many of these

circuits are expected to depend on extracellular cues emanated
from the tumor microenvironment, which often plays the role
of a "cancer stem cell niche." The impact of these cues on the
response to targeted therapies may be underestimated in
classical xenopatients, if, as in the case of HGF, murine
environmental factors weakly cross-react with human receptors. This limitation can be now circumvented by genetic
modiﬁcation of either cancer stem cells or the murine host,
the spheropatient (Fig. 1). In sum, the population-based studies in xenopatients can be integrated by a reductionist
approach in isolated cancer stem cells, and a new hypothesis
emerging in vitro can be assessed by a further xenografting step
in a more sophisticated mouse recipient. The hope is that such
a xenopatient–xenosphere–spheropatient system, in colorectal as well as in other tumors, may offer a more rapid and robust
ﬂux of information reverberating to the patient. This information should contribute to rigorously deﬁne the sensitivity of the
critical cellular target (the cancer stem cell) to the targeting
agent, to recognize the factors supporting primary and secondary resistance, and to identify biomarkers for monitoring
target inhibition. Sad to notice, but these obvious actions,
required to predict and control the therapeutic response, are
often slackly implemented in the translational setting, and fail
to guide the design of clinical trials. As a result, the clinical and
molecular interpretation of the therapeutic outcomes may
remain inconclusive. The case of combined inhibition of EGFR
and MET in lung cancers (41), recently discontinued for lack of
clinical beneﬁt, is one of the last, paradigmatic examples.
