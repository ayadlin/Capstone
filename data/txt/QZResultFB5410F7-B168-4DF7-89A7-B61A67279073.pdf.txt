ABSTRACT
Transcription factor NFAT1 has been recently identified as a new regulator of the
MDM2 oncogene. Targeting the NFAT1-MDM2 pathway represents a novel approach to
cancer therapy. We have recently identified a natural product MDM2 inhibitor, termed JapA.
As a specific and potent MDM2 inhibitor, JapA inhibits MDM2 at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be fully elucidated
for its inhibitory effects on MDM2 transcription. Herein, we reported that JapA inhibited
NFAT1 and NFAT1-mediated MDM2 transcription, which contributed to the anticancer
activity of JapA. Its effects on the expression and activity of NFAT1 were examined in
various breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors
in vivo. The specificity of JapA in targeting NFAT1 and NFAT1-MDM2 pathway and the
importance of NFAT1 inhibition in JapA’s anticancer activity were demonstrated using
NFAT1 overexpression and knockdown cell lines and the pharmacological activators and
inhibitors of NFAT1 signaling. Our results indicated that JapA inhibited NFAT1 signaling
in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, which plays a pivotal role in its anticancer
activity. JapA inhibited the nuclear localization of NFAT1, disrupted the NFAT1-MDM2
P2 promoter complex, and induced NFAT1 proteasomal degradation, resulting in the
repression of MDM2 transcription. In conclusion, JapA is a novel NFAT1 inhibitor and the
NFAT1 inhibition is responsible for the JapA-induced repression of MDM2 transcription,
contributing to its anticancer activity. The results may pave an avenue for validating the
NFAT1-MDM2 pathway as a novel molecular target for cancer therapy.

role in cancer development and progression via p53-dependent
and p53-independent mechanisms of action [3–7]. MDM2 has
been demonstrated as a promising molecular target for cancer
therapy and many MDM2 inhibitors have been developed
as new anticancer drugs [8–15]. In an effort to screen small
molecule inhibitors of MDM2 for the development of novel
and effective cancer therapeutics, we identified a potent and
selective MDM2 inhibitor, termed JapA (Figure 1A) [13].
JapA is a structurally unique dimeric sesquiterpenoid
that was isolated from the aerial part of Inula japonica

medicine for the treatment of inflammation, diabetes,
digestive disorders, and bronchitis [16–18]. JapA has the
similar structural features of artemisinin and parthenolide,
which are under preclinical and clinical studies for cancer
therapy [19]. However, due to its dimerization status and
unique mechanisms of action, JapA is considered to be
more effective than these analogs as an anticancer drug.
We have demonstrated that JapA inhibits the tumor growth
and prevents metastasis in breast cancer xenograft models,
without inducing any host toxicity [13]. It has also been
observed that JapA is safe and effective in treating other
human cancers containing high expression levels of
MDM2, e.g., Burkitt lymphoma and lung cancer [20–21].
Mechanistically, JapA decreases MDM2 protein stability
and inhibits MDM2 transcription, regardless of p53 status
of the cells or tumors [13]. At the post-translational level,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

JapA directly binds to MDM2 protein and induces MDM2
auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. JapA has
also been found to inhibit MDM2 transcription in a nuclear
factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-dependent manner, but
the molecular mechanism is still not clear yet.
NFAT is a group of inducible transcription factors
with five distinct family members NFAT1 to NFAT5,
and it has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in
the regulation of various aspects of the immune system
and numerous developmental programs in vertebrates
(reviewed in references [22–23]). The NFAT proteins
regulate diverse cellular functions, such as cell
survival, cell cycle progression, migration, invasion, and
angiogenesis [24–25]. Increasing evidence suggests the
dual roles for NFAT isoforms as oncogene and tumor
suppressor in different types of human cancer [24, 26].

NFAT1, the first identified member of NFAT family is
overexpressed and constitutively activated in several
human cancers, including breast cancer [27–30]. NFAT1
is involved in the tumor growth and metastasis through
regulating the expression of its target genes, e.g., c-Myc
and Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) [24–26]. We have recently
discovered that NFAT1 activates the MDM2 oncogene and
this pathway contributes to the overexpression of MDM2
in cancer cells with non-functional p53 [31]. Therefore,
targeting NFAT1 and NFAT1-MDM2 pathway could be
a promising strategy for the discovery of novel cancer
therapeutic agents.
The present study was designed to investigate the
molecular mechanisms for NFAT1-mediated inhibitory
effects of JapA on MDM2 transcription and to demonstrate
the role of NFAT1 in JapA’s anticancer activity in vitro
and in vivo. Since the initial evidence for JapA-induced
MDM2 inhibition was obtained with in vitro and in vivo
breast cancer models [13], we utilized the same models in
the present study. Our results not only helped elucidate the
molecular mechanism of JapA as a new class of NFAT1
inhibitor, but also would facilitate the validation of the
therapeutic potential of targeting NFAT1 and NFAT1MDM2 pathway, providing a basis for further preclinical
and clinical development of NFAT1-MDM2 inhibitors for
human cancer therapy.

levels of NFAT1 in both the MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 breast cancer xenograft models, as detected by
immunohistochemical staining (Figure 1D) and western
blotting (Figure 1E). Consistent with the in vitro results,
JapA treatment also reduced the protein levels of c-Myc
and COX-2 in the tumors (Figure 1E). Together, these
results suggested that JapA inhibits NFAT1 signaling in
breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

JapA inhibits NFAT1-mediated MDM2 protein
expression
Considering that NFAT1 upregulates MDM2
expression in a p53-independent manner [31], we
examined the effects of JapA on NFAT1-mediated MDM2
expression. As shown in Figure 2A, JapA decreased the
MDM2 protein expression in both MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines, regardless of p53 status of the cells.
However, the enforced expression of NFAT1 induced
MDM2 protein expression and reduced the inhibition
of MDM2 by JapA. Similar results were observed in
breast cancer cells transfected with or without HA-tagged
constitutively-activated NFAT1 (CA-NFAT1) followed by
JapA treatment (Figure 2B). In contrast, the transfection
of a dominant-negative NFAT (DN-NFAT) (Figure 2C) or
NFAT1 siRNA (Figure 2D) led to the downregulation of
MDM2 expression, which was further enhanced by JapA
in both breast cancer cell lines. These results indicated
an inhibitory effect of JapA on NFAT1-activated MDM2
protein expression.

JapA inhibits NFAT1 signaling in breast cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo

JapA represses NFAT1-mediated MDM2
transcription

JapA has been found to inhibit the MDM2
transcription in an NFAT-dependent manner, while
NFAT1 has been recently identified as a novel activator
of the MDM2 oncogene [13, 31]. Therefore, we examined
whether JapA (Figure 1A) affects NFAT1 expression in
human normal breast cells and breast cancer cells. As
shown in Figure 1B, a significant inhibition of NFAT1
expression by JapA was observed in MCF-7 (p53 wildtype), MCF-7/p53−/− (p53 knockdown), MDA-MB-231
(p53 mutant), and MDA-MB-468 (p53 mutant) human
breast cancer cell lines. There was no apparent reduction of
NFAT1 expression levels in human breast epithelial MCF10A and human mammary luminal epithelial (HMLE)
cell lines. We further demonstrated that JapA inhibited
the protein expression of NFAT1 and its transcriptional
responsive genes c-Myc and COX-2 in a concentrationdependent manner in both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cell lines (Figure 1C).
The effects of JapA on the NFAT1 signaling were
examined in the same breast cancer xenograft tumors
we used in the previous study [13]. The significant
downregulation of MDM2 expression levels by JapA
has been observed in these tumor samples. Compared
with vehicle-treated tumors, JapA reduced the expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We further examined the effects of JapA on NFAT1mediated MDM2 transcription. As shown in Figure 3A,
HA-NFAT1 overexpression increased the MDM2 mRNA
levels (P < 0.01), and JapA reduced both the basic and
HA-NFAT1-induced MDM2 mRNA expression (P < 0.05)
in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. However,
JapA treatment had no significant effects on the DNNFAT-attenuated MDM2 mRNA expression in these
cells (Figure 3B). Similarly, JapA reduced the MDM2
mRNA expression that was induced by ionomycin (ION,
an activator of calcineurin) (Figure 3C), but it did not
show significant enhancement of the downregulation
of the MDM2 mRNA levels by cyclosporine A (CsA, a
calcineurin inhibitor) (Figure 3D). Furthermore, enforced
NFAT1 expression increased the MDM2 luciferase
activity (P < 0.001), which was reduced by JapA treatment
(P < 0.05) (Figure 3E). Similar results were observed
when NFAT1 was activated using ION (Figure 3F).

COX-2, and MDM2, resulting in cancer cell proli­feration
and migration [31–34]. Therefore, we further examined
the effects of JapA on NFAT1 localization in both MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. As shown in Figure 4A,
JapA decreased the protein levels of both cytoplasmic
and nuclear NFAT1, which could be partially restored
by ION and further decreased by CsA. The inhibitory
effects of JapA on NFAT1 nuclear localization were also
confirmed by an immunofluorescence study in both cell
lines. As shown in Figure 4B, JapA treatment decreased
the immunostaining of NFAT1 in the nucleus, which led
to the repression of its transcriptional activity.

the binding (Figure 5A). We then performed a chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay combined with a realtime quantitative PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 5B,
endogenous NFAT1 from MDA-MB-231 cells specifically
bound the P2 promoter of MDM2 (P < 0.01), and JapA
reduced the binding of NFAT1 to the MDM2 P2 promoter
(P < 0.05).

JapA induces the ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of NFAT1
We next examined the mechanisms responsible
for the JapA-induced NFAT1 inhibition. As shown in
Figure 6A, JapA increased NFAT1 protein degradation
in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor,
cycloheximide (CHX), shortening the half-life of the
NFAT1 protein in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cell lines. Further studies showed that the NFAT1
reduction induced by JapA was prevented by MG-132
(a proteasome inhibitor) treatment (Figure 6B), which
indicated that JapA could induce the proteasomal
degradation of NFAT1. These results were supported
by the fact that JapA promoted NFAT1 ubiquitination
(Figure 6C). Together, JapA promoted the ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation of NFAT1, and thereby
inhibited the expression and activity of NFAT1 in breast
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

JapA inhibits the interaction between NFAT1
and the MDM2 P2 promoter
Since NFAT1 activates MDM2 transcription through
direct binding to the MDM2 P2 promoter [31], we then
examined whether JapA affects the interaction between
NFAT1 and the MDM2 P2 promoter. As shown in
Figure 5A, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
showed that endogenous NFAT1 from MDA-MB-231 cells
was specifically bound to the MDM2 P2 promoter, and
this binding was significantly reduced by JapA treatment.
In addition, the nuclear extracts from ION-treated cells
showed the enhanced binding of NFAT1 to the MDM2
probe, whereas simultaneous treatment with CsA inhibited

(Figure 8A) and reduced the effects of JapA on NFAT1MDM2 pathway (Figure 8A), cell viability (Figure 8B),
and apoptosis (Figure 8C). However, NFAT1 KD
decreased the expression levels of MDM2 (Figure 8D) and

DISCUSSION

novel molecular mechanisms distinct from other MDM2
inhibitors under development [13]. JapA directly binds to
MDM2 protein and induces MDM2 autoubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. JapA also inhibits MDM2
transcription in an NFAT-dependent manner, suggesting
that JapA inhibits MDM2 via alternative mechanisms
different from the MDM2 inhibitors that target MDM2-p53
interaction and MDM2 itself. It has been reported that the
transcription factor NFAT1 activates MDM2, independent
of p53 [31]. In the present study, we demonstrated that the
inhibitory effects of JapA on MDM2 transcription depend
on the inhibition of NFAT1, regardless of the p53 status
of the cells.
NFAT proteins (NFAT1-NFAT5) are a group of
inducible transcription factors and have been implicated in
many biological processes, including cancer development
and progression [24–26]. We and other investigators
have suggested NFAT as a potential molecular target for
cancer therapy [24–26]. NFAT1, also named NFATp or
NFATc2, is overexpressed and hyperactivated in human
cancers, including breast cancer [27–30]. Aberrant
activation of NFAT1 signaling results in the upregulation
of genes associated with tumor growth and metastasis,
such as MDM2 and c-Myc [24–26]. Recent evidences
have suggested that NFAT1 plays a critical role in breast
cancer development and progression. It has been found that

In the present study, we demonstrated that the newly
discovered MDM2 inhibitor JapA inhibits NFAT1 and
NFAT1-MDM2 signaling, which plays a critical role in its
anticancer activity. Our findings provide evidence for the
value of NFAT1 and NFAT1-MDM2 signaling as novel
targets in developing effective targeted therapy for human
cancers.
We have made several important discoveries in
the present study. First, JapA represents a new class of
NFAT1 inhibitors that target both NFAT1 and NFAT1MDM2 signaling. Second, JapA inhibits the expression
and activity of NFAT1 in breast cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo. Third, JapA inhibits NFAT1-mediated expression of
the transcriptional responsive genes by inhibiting NFAT1
nuclear localization and disrupting NFAT1-DNA binding.
Fourth, JapA induces NFAT1 protein ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. Finally, the inhibition
of NFAT1 and NFAT1-MDM2 pathway is critical for
JapA’s anticancer activity. Our results demonstrated the
characterization of JapA as a novel NFAT1 inhibitor and
the importance of NFAT1 and NFAT1-MDM2 signaling in
JapA’s inhibitory effect against human cancer.
Our previous studies have demonstrated that JapA
is a selective and potent inhibitor of MDM2 and has

intensity ratio under each band was obtained by IMAGEJ software analysis normalized on untreated control. B. MDA-MB-231 cells were
treated with JapA (2 μM) or the vehicle for 24 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with NFAT1 or IgG antibodies. The DNA bound
to the endogenous NFAT1 was eluted and quantified using primers specific for the MDM2 P2 promoter by PCR. All of the experiments were
repeated three times. (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, “ns” denotes “not significant”).

NFAT1 promotes breast cancer cell motility and invasion
by regulating COX-2 and glypican-6 [30, 34–35]. NFAT1
also functions as a critical factor in Akt/protein kinase B
(PKB) and Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) signaling
pathways to regulate the breast cancer metastasis [36].
In addition, NFAT1 promotes intratumoral neutrophil
infiltration by regulating interleukin-8 (IL8) expression
in breast cancer [37]. NFAT1 and signal transducer and
activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) signaling cascades have
been found to antagonize each other in breast cancer, which
may affect breast cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis
[28]. Importantly, the constitutive activation of NFAT1
signaling has been observed in diagnostic breast cancer
cases, and it is essential to the tumorigenic and metastatic
potential of breast cancer cells [38]. Therefore, targeting
NFAT1 is a promising strategy for developing novel and
effective anti-breast cancer therapy.
NFAT1 exerts its oncogenic functions in human
cancer through calcineurin-dependent and –independent
pathways [24–26]. Once activated, calcineurin directly
dephosphorylates NFAT1 protein, leading to its nuclear
translocation and the transactivation of its target genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[24, 26]. The balance between nuclear import and export
of the NFAT1 protein is also regulated by various kinases,
such as GSK3β, casein kinase 1 (CK1), and protein
kinase A (PKA), independent of calcineurin [24]. Several
strategies have been demonstrated to develop novel
NFAT inhibitors. First, targeting the upstream regulators
of NFAT proteins, such as calcineurin and GSK3β, to
inhibit NFAT protein dephosphorylation and nuclear
translocation; second, directly targeting NFAT proteins
themselves to inhibit NFAT expression and nuclear
translocation; and third, blocking NFAT-DNA binding to
inhibit NFAT transcriptional activity. Thus far, most of the
NFAT inhibitors under development have been designed
by following the first strategy, such as VIVIT peptides
[39–40], PxIxIT peptides [41], CsA [42–44], FK-506
[44–45], and NCI3 [46].
Increasing evidences have suggested that different
NFAT isoforms even have opposite roles in the same cancer
type. For example, the overexpression and hyperactiva­
tion of NFAT1 and NFAT2 are frequently observed
in human cancer and contribute to cancer develop­
ment, progression, and metastasis [24, 26, 31, 47–49].

Figure 6: Effects of JapA on NFAT1 protein stability. A. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with JapA or vehicle,
followed by exposure to a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX, 15 μg/mL). The NFAT1 protein levels were detected by
Western blotting at the indicated times after exposure to CHX. Graphs (right) show the quantification of the immunoblotting data. B. The
cells were treated with JapA or vehicle (1 and 2 μM, respectively, for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells) for 24 h, then exposed to MG-132

under each band was obtained by IMAGEJ software analysis normalized on untreated control. C. The cells were co-transfected with NFAT1
and ubiquitin plasmids, followed by treatment with JapA for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an NFAT1
antibody. The ubiquitinated NFAT1 was detected using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. All of the experiments were repeated three times.

However, NFAT3 has been reported to be specifically
expressed in estrogen receptor α positive breast cancer
cells and reduce cancer cell motility by inhibiting the
expression of Lipocalin 2 [50]. Up to date, most of the
NFAT inhibitors have been developed to nonspecifically
inhibit all calcineurin-responsive NFAT isoforms no
matter whether they exert their roles as an oncogene or a
tumor suppressor, resulting in suboptimal efficacy against
human cancer and unexpected side effects on human
immune system. Several NFAT inhibitors that target
either oncogenic NFAT isoforms, such as helenalin [51]
and zoledronic acid [52], or NFAT-DNA binding, such as
imperatorin [53] and digitoxin [54] have shown significant
anticancer activities in vitro and in vivo. The present study
reports, for the first time, a novel NFAT1 inhibitor JapA
that targets both oncogenic NFAT1 and NFAT1 interaction
with the MDM2 P2 promoter.
We have demonstrated that JapA is a novel
NFAT1 inhibitor. Several assays have been performed to
demonstrate the specificity of JapA in targeting NFAT1 and
NFAT1-MDM2 pathway in breast cancer cells. First, the
inhibitory effects of JapA on the expression of NFAT1 and
its target genes, MDM2, c-Myc and COX-2, were shown
in human breast cancer cells in vitro and breast xenograft
tumors in vivo. Second, the inhibitory effects of JapA on
NFAT1-mediated MDM2 activation were demonstrated
using breast cancer cells with NFAT1 OE or KD, as well
as other pharmacological inhibitors and activators of
calcineurin-NFAT signaling. Third, the inhibitory effects
of JapA on NFAT1 nuclear localization and NFAT1DNA binding were demonstrated using immunostaining,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EMSA and CHIP assays. NFAT1 activates MDM2 through
interacting with the MDM2 P2 promoter but not the P1
promoter, while our results have shown that JapA inhibits
the binding of NFAT1 to MDM2 P2 promoter, independent
of p53. Importantly, the positive regulation of MDM2
by NFAT1 has been observed in human hepatocellular
carcinoma tissue samples, regardless of the p53 status
of the tumors [13]. Since JapA represents a new class of
MDM2 inhibitors that inhibit both MDM2 and its activator
NFAT1, it could be more effective than other NFAT1 or
MDM2 inhibitors in treating tumors with high expression
levels of both NFAT1 and MDM2. Moreover, its excellent
efficacy for treating tumors with both wild-type p53 and
non-functional p53 is also expected. Fourth, the JapAinduced NFAT1 protein destabilization was attributed
to NFAT1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation,
which was elucidated using protein synthesis inhibitor and
proteasome inhibitor and determined by an ubiquitination
assay. Although it has been reported that the NFAT1
ubiquitination is mediated by MDM2 through its E3
ubiquitin ligase activity [30], more direct evidence is still
needed for the role of MDM2 in JapA-induced NFAT1
protein degradation.
We have further demonstrated that NFAT1 and
NFAT1-MDM2 pathway play a critical role in JapA’s
inhibitory effects against human cancer, as indicated
in NFAT1 OE and KD MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) and
MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant) breast cancer cell lines.
Despite these results, there is no direct evidence that
JapA just specifically inhibits NFAT1 and further studies
on its effects on other NFAT isoforms are needed. The

by treatment with various concentrations of JapA for (D) 24 h for the expression of NFAT1 and MDM2; (E) 24 h for the colony formation
assay; and (F) 48 h for the apoptosis assay. The intensity ratio under each band was obtained by IMAGEJ software analysis normalized on
untreated control. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01).

determination and validation of the direct binding of
JapA to NFAT1 would help address these issues partially.
Moreover, it is possible that JapA may have other
molecular targets that are important for its anticancer
activity; further exploration of additional targets also needs
to be considered, such as MDMX and other oncogenic
NFAT isoforms.
Of note, we have shown the in vivo efficacy of JapA
and its safety profile at two dose levels (15 and 30 mg/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

kg/day) in breast cancer xenograft models [13]. We have
found that JapA effectively inhibits the tumor growth and
the protein expression of MDM2 and NFAT1 in vivo,
without inducing any apparent host toxicity. It is expected
that JapA at these dose levels is safe and effective in
treating other tumors with high expression levels of
MDM2 and NFAT1, regardless of p53 status of the tumors.
However, the toxicological profile of JapA needs to be
further characterized using more clinically relevant animal

models, especially syngeneic models, since NFAT1 plays a
critical role in human immune system and developmental
programs. The effects of JapA on the expression and
activity of NFAT1 should be further examined in both
immune cells and tumor cells to determine if JapA affects
the immune system or it is selective for tumor cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that JapA
inhibits the expression and activity of oncogenic NFAT1
through inhibiting NFAT1 nuclear localization and NFAT1DNA binding and promoting NFAT1 ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation, which contributes to the
anticancer activity of JapA. These results indicate that JapA

and luciferase assay

is a novel anticancer drug candidate with a dual-targeting
mechanism and provide new insights into the future
development of novel dual inhibitors of NFAT1 and MDM2
for cancer therapy. However, it is tempting to speculate that
the unique inhibitory effects of JapA on NFAT1-MDM2
pathway and its efficacy and toxicological profile should
be further explored for the elucidation of uncharacterized
mechanisms of action, as well as the development of safe
and effective anticancer therapy.

For real-time quantitative PCR analysis, total
RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) and analyzed as described previously
[59–60]. For immunoblotting assay, cell lysates and
tissue homogenates were prepared in NP40 lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The
protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford
reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The expression levels
of various proteins were examined as described previously
[58–59]. For luciferase assay, cells were co-transfected
with full-length human MDM2 P2 promoter vector with
the Renilla luciferase reporter as an internal control [13].
After exposure to JapA for 24 h, the luciferase activity
of the MDM2 promoter reporters was determined using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega,
Madison, WI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
and MDA-MB-468) and non-malignant epithelial
(MCF-10A) cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Human
mammary luminal epithelial (HMLE) cells were obtained
from Zen-Bio, Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC). The
MCF-7 p53−/− and the inducible NFAT1 OE MCF-7 cell
lines were established previously [31, 55–56]. HMLE cells
were grown in mammary luminal epithelial cell growth
medium (Zen-Bio, Inc.). Other cell lines were cultured as
reported by us earlier [13].

Ubiquitination assay
Cells were co-transfected with NFAT1 and ubiquitin
plasmids and treated with various concentrations of
JapA. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiNFAT1 antibody, and the bound proteins were purified
with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO),
resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by an anti-ubiquitin
antibody [13].

Chemicals, reagents, antibodies, plasmids,
and siRNA
JapA was obtained as previously reported [13], with
the purity being > 95% as confirmed by IR, ESI-MS, NMR,
and HPLC/MSn [16–17]. All chemicals and solvents were
of the highest analytical grade available. The anti-human
NFAT1 (1/NFAT-1) antibody was from BD Biosciences
(San Jose, CA). The anti-human COX-2 (C-20) and c-Myc
(0.N.222) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc. (Dallas, TX). The anti-human MDM2 (Ab-2) antibody
was from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA). The anti-human
ubiquitin (6C1) and β-actin (AC-15) antibodies were from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and
goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were obtained from Bio-Rad
(Hercules, CA). The human full-length MDM2 P2 promoter
reporters were kind gifts from Dr. J.P. Blaydes (Southampton
General Hospital, UK). Vectors expressing HA-NFAT1,
CA-NFAT1, and DN-NFAT were kindly provided by Dr.
C.W. Chow (Yeshiva University). NFAT1 siRNA or control
siRNA were from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Both
plasmids and siRNAs were transfected into cells using the
same protocols as we reported previously [57].

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with JapA
(2 μM), ION (4 μM), and/or CsA (2 μM) for 24 h, and
nuclear factions were extracted using the NE-PER
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL). The NFAT1 DNA-binding
activity was measured as described previously [31].
The prepared nuclear extracts were preincubated with
1 μg of poly-(dI:dC) (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) and then reacted with a biotin-labeled MDM2
probe at room temperature for 30 min. The sequences
of the biotin-labeled probe were MDM2 forward,
5′-gcaggttgactcagcttttcctcttgagctggtcaagttca-3′ and MDM2
reverse, 5′-tgaacttgaccagctcaagaggaaaagctgagtcaacctgc-3′.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DMSO
or JapA (2 μM) for 24 h, then the chromatin immuno­
precipitation (ChIP) assay was performed in the
treated cells as described previously [31]. The specific
primer pairs used were: 5′-cccccgtgacctttaccctg-3′ and
5′-agcctttgtgcggttcgtg-3′ for qualitative or quantitative
PCR amplification of the responsive element of the MDM2
promoter.

Assays for cell viability, colony formation
and apoptosis
The cells were treated with various concentrations
of JapA, and the cell viability, cell colony formation and
apoptosis assays were performed as described previously
[58–59].

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Cell immunofluorescence assay
and immunohistochemistry

The authors declare that they have no competing
financial interests.

For immunofluorescence assay, cells were seeded on
coverslips in a 12-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells/
well, allowed to attach overnight, and treated with JapA for
12 h. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence
detection as reported [58]. For the immunohistochemical
studies, the fresh tumor tissues were dissected from the
mice bearing both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 xenograft
tumors [13]. These breast cancer xenograft models were
developed by following the animal study protocols that have
been approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care
Committee of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center. The dose, dose frequency, and administration route
were chosen based on the previous studies [13, 18, 20].
The dissected tumor tissues were fixed and stained for the
protein expression and location of NFAT1 following the
reported protocols [13].
