Abstract
The anti-HER receptor antibodies cetuximab, trastuzumab,
and pertuzumab are used widely in clinic to treat metastatic
cancer. However, activation of the extensive crosstalk among
the HER receptors as well as other RTKs, particularly HER-MET
crosstalk, has emerged as a likely source of drug resistance. In
this study, we developed two new types of tetra-speciﬁc antibodies that recognize EGFR, HER2, HER3, and VEGF. These
tetra-speciﬁc antibodies, termed FL518 (four-in-one antibody)
and CRTB6 (tetra-speciﬁc, tetravalent antibody), not only
inhibited signaling mediated by these receptors in vitro and

in vivo but unexpectedly also disrupted HER-MET crosstalk.
When compared with two-in-one antibodies and a series of
bispeciﬁc antibodies in multiple tumor models, FL518 and
CRTB6 were more broadly efﬁcacious. We further showed that
tetra-speciﬁc antibodies were far more effective than bispeciﬁc
antibodies in inhibiting the growth of anti–HER-resistant cancer cells, which exhibited elevated levels of MET activation both
in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results establish a new principle
to achieve combined HER inhibition and limit drug resistance
using a single antibody. Cancer Res; 75(1); 159–70. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

erlotinib and geﬁtinib. Another family member, HER3, has recently emerged as a novel drug target because its upregulation is an
adverse prognostic factor in many tumor types and is associated
with worse survival (4–6). Although HER inhibitors have been
widely evaluated in clinic, these promising anticancer drugs are
effective only for a limited time, due to the resistance developed
by tumor cells (7). Signaling shift has been proved for when such
intensely proliferative cancer cells faced a strong signaling inhibitor. For instance, HER3 has also been implicated in the development of resistance to anti-EGFR or anti-HER2 therapy (8–10). A
shift from HER1 homodimer to HER1/HER3 heterodimer signaling in response to sustained treatment with EGFR inhibitors leads
to reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and bypasses the therapeutic action of these compounds. Upregulation of HER3 seems
to be driven by negative feedback from AKT (11). Ampliﬁcation of
the tyrosine kinase receptor MET induces HER3 phosphorylation
and PI3K activation, representing another mechanism by which
HER3 confers resistance to EGFR-targeting therapies (11, 12).
Data increasingly indicate the signiﬁcant status of combined
inhibition strategies for directing key signaling networks of the
HER family, including cetuximab plus trastuzumab (13), cetuximab plus bevacizumab (14), and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab
(2). Recently, generation of bispeciﬁc antibodies that have the
capacity to bind two different antigens simultaneously has
become a new trend of engineering antibodies (15), and a number
of recombinant strategies have been developed to synthesize
bispeciﬁc antibodies (8, 16, 17). Indeed, in 2009, catumaxomab
(Removab, Neovii Biotech) was approved as the ﬁrst bispeciﬁc
antibody drug for the treatment of malignant ascites (18). For
anti–HER-targeted therapy, previous studies have shown that
bispeciﬁc antibodies engineered from anti-EGFR or -HER2 may
give promising results (19, 20). Moreover, two-in-one antibodies,
which created a surface that speciﬁcally binds two target antigens
with high afﬁnity using a single antibody binding site (21, 22),

Deregulation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor
(HER) family plays a signiﬁcant role in tumorigenesis and progression (1). The basic and clinical research into two of the family
members, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) and
HER2, has led the way in transforming therapeutic biomolecules
from bench to bedside, including the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, the anti-HER2 antibodies trastuzumab
and pertuzumab (2, 3), and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

have aroused abundant interest in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the in vivo
properties, such as pharmacokinetics, stability, and effector function, of the IgG-based bispeciﬁc antibodies are expected to be
similar to those of standard monoclonal antibodies, which are
crucial for clinical use. Thanks to the design of two-in-one antibodies, we were able to create IgG-based tetra-speciﬁc antibodies
using current antibody engineering methodologies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, antibodies, and animals
All cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), except HCC827 and gastric cancer cell
line MNK45, which were purchased from the German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. All the cell lines were
authenticated twice by morphologic and isoenzyme analyses
during the study period. Cell lines were routinely checked for
contamination by mycoplasma using Hoechst staining and consistently found to be negative. Cells were cultured in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% FCS in 5% CO2 at 37.8 C in
a humidiﬁed incubator. Cetuximab was purchased from Merck.
Trastuzumab and bevacizumab were purchased from Roche Ltd.
Six-week-old female BALB/c nude mice and eight- to 12-week-old
C.B-17 SCID mice were obtained from the Shanghai Experimental
Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China). All animals were treated in accordance with guidelines of
the Committee on Animals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Designed antibodies
Four-in-one CrossMab FL518 were generated from MEHD7945A
(23) and bH1-44 (24) as previously described (25). Four-in-one
dual-variable domain antibodies (DVD-Ig) methodology (26) was
utilized to generate DVD Ig CRTB6, together with the "knobs into
holes" (KiH) methodology and the CrossMab methodology. Bispeciﬁc crossmabs CT9, CB12, RT6, and RB4 were generated from
cetuximab/trastuzumab, cetuximab/bevacizumab, RG7116 (antiHER3)/trastuzumab, and RG7116/bevacizumab.
Construction, expression, and protein puriﬁcation
Residues 1–619 of the extracellular domain of EGFR (EGFRECD), residues 1–513 of the HER3-ECD, residues 1–646 of
HER2-ECD, and residues 8–109 of human VEGF were prepared
as described previously (27, 28) except that we employed the
pcDNA3.1(þ)-expressing vector (Invitrogen) and the FreeStyle
293 expression system (Invitrogen). Four-in-one antibodies
and bispeciﬁc crossmabs were cloned, expressed, and puriﬁed
following reported procedures (29).
Immunoblotting
Cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies in serumfree medium for 1 hour at 36.5 C, then treated with EGF (0.5
nmol/L), HRG (0.5 nmol/L), VEGF (0.5 nmol), or not for 15
minutes. After washing, the cells were lysed and the lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with
antibodies against EGFR, phospho-EGFR-Tyr1068, phosphoHER2-Tyr1221/1222, phospho-HER3-Tyr1289, phospho-METTyr1234/5, AKT, phospho-AKT-Ser473, phospho-STAT3-Ser705,
p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p44/42 ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204, EGFR,
HER2, and MET (all from Cell Signaling Technology), and HER3
(Santa Cruz). All assays were performed independently three
times.

Coimmunoprecipitation assays
Coimmunoprecipitation assay was used to evaluate the
HER/MET heterodimerization as previously described (28, 30).
Cells were lysed in 1 mL RPMI lysis buffer [1% v/v DevelopTriton
X-100, 1% w/v CHAPS, 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.2)], in RPMI
medium containing 0.2 mmol/L PMSF, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10
U/mL aprotinin, and 1 mmol/L Na3VO4. Heterodimers were
immunoprecipitated from 500 mL of lysate using indicated antibodies covalently coupled to agarose (Pierce ultralink) for 1 hour
at 36.5 C. Recombinant human EGF and HRG (R&D Systems)
were added at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 nmol/L, respectively.
Complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer and resuspended in
SDS sample buffer and boiled. Samples were separated on a 4% to
12% polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in 10% BSA/TBST and
probed with indicated antibodies. Western blot and protein
immunoprecipitation analyses were performed after the CST
protocol.
Cell proliferation assay
H1666 cells (4,000 cells/well) and H1993 cells (3,000 cells/
well) were plated in 96-well plates. The next day, cells were treated
with indicated concentrations of antibody in 1% serum-containing medium. Depending on the cell line, ligand was added
simultaneously. After 3 to 4 days, AlamarBlue (Invtiogen) was
added to the wells and ﬂuorescence was read using a 96-well
ﬂuorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission of 590 nm.
The results are shown as relative ﬂuorescence units (RFU). For
MTS assay, cells were treated with 10 mg/mL recombinant antibodies. Recombinant human EGF, HRG, and VEGF (R&D Systems) were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 nmol/L, respectively. After an additional 4- to 7-day incubation, cell proliferation
was determined by Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega). All assays were performed
independently three times.
In vivo therapy study
C.B-17 SCID mice were inoculated with 5  106 BxPC3
cells suspended in HBSS. For MDA-MB-231, BT474, MCF-7,
HCC1954, or ReHCC1954 in vivo xenograft studies, 3  106
BT474 or MCF-7 cells, 4  106 HCC1954, or ReHCC1954 cells
were inoculated into the mammary fat pads of female BALB/c
nude mice implanted with 0.72-mg 60-day release 17b-estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America; ref. 31). For
HCC827 or ReHCC827 xenograft studies, 5  106 HCC827
or ReHCC827 cells were inoculated into BALB/c nude mice.
Mice were randomly split into groups of 10 mice each as tumor
volumes reached an average of about 150 mm3. Multiple dose
studies comprised 4 weeks of treatment, with the ﬁrst dose (day
of randomization) being a 2 loading dose. Tumors were
measured with calipers at least once a week for the duration
of the study. Tumors were measured with digital calipers, and
tumor volumes were calculated by the formula: volume ¼
length  (width)2/2.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the Student unpaired t test
to identify signiﬁcant differences unless otherwise indicated, with
P value of less than 0.05 considered signiﬁcant difference. Additional methods can be found in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Novel Four-in-One Antibodies

chain interactions was achieved using the CrossMab methodology (Fig. 1B; ref. 34).
Because one Fab of FL518 can bind either EGFR or HER3 and
the other Fab can bind either HER2 or VEGF, a certain concentration of FL518 antibodies can directly bind to EGFR, HER3,
HER2, and VEGF on the surface of the cell membrane during the
same period. However, this kind of four-in-one antibody has its
own limits in that one antibody molecule can only binds two of
the targets. Thus, we employ the DVD-Ig methodology (35), the
KiH methodology, and the CrossMab methodology to make a
tetra-speciﬁc, tetravalent antibody termed as CRTB6 (Fig. 1C). For
this antibody design, one IgG-like antibody molecular now can
bind to four targets. We use the V region of cetuximab and
RG7116 (36) in the Fab arms for EGFR and HER3, for their ability
to block the EGF- and HRG-dependent homo- or hetero-dimerization and signaling and the V region of trastuzumab, which has
shown its unique effect on ligand-independent EGFR/HER2 or
HER3/HER2 signaling (37). In addition, anti-VEGF antibody
bevacizumab was added to make this tetra-speciﬁc, tetravalent
antibody more comparable with FL518. Because the dimerization
and communication among HER family members are the key
events of EGFR, HER2, and HER3, there is reason to suspect that
this tetra-speciﬁc, tetravalent antibody may be more efﬁcacious
than FL518.
FL518 binding to immobilized HER3-ECD or immobilized
HER2-ECD was observed to reduce in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amounts of EGFR-ECD or VEGF, respectively. Conversely, FL518 was competed away from immobilized EGFR-ECD or immobilized VEGF by soluble HER3-ECD
or HER2-ECD protein, respectively. As expected, given their
relative binding constants, higher concentrations of soluble
EGFR-ECD or VEGF were needed to compete with the binding
of FL518 to immobilized HER3-ECD or HER2-ECD. These data
were consistent with the parental antibodies MEHD7945A and
bH1-44 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, no such data can be detected for
DVD-Ig CRTB6 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Competitive binding
assays employing antibodies were also performed and showed
that the epitopes of these four-in-one antibodies overlap with
the epitopes of MEHD7945A and bH1-44 on EGFR, HER3,
HER2, and VEGF (Fig. 1E).
The afﬁnities of the four-in-one antibodies and the parental
antibodies for EGFR, HER3, HER2, and VEGF were determined
by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As suggested by molecular modeling, the afﬁnities of the four-in-one antibodies to
their respective ligands did not differ signiﬁcantly from those
of the parental antibodies and simultaneous binding to both
ligands could be shown by SPR assay (Supplementary Table
S1). In addition, as summarized in Supplementary Table S2,
the main PK parameters of FL518 and CRTB6 in mice were very
close to those of MEHD7945A, bH1-44, and trastuzumab. The
data presented in Supplementary Table S2 also show that
FL518 and CRTB6 had PK properties analogous to those of
a conventional IgG molecule. Taken together, these data indi-

cate the favorable stability properties of the four-in-one
antibodies.
Four-in-one antibodies potently inhibit receptor
phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and VEGFR2
To evaluate their inhibitory efﬁcacy on EGFR and downstream
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, we pretreated high EGFR-expressing
Caco-2 cells (38) with parental antibodies, FL518, or CRTB6
before EGF stimulation and determined that FL518 and CRTB6
inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2, respectively (Fig.
1F), with an effect similar to the MEHD7945A and the monospeciﬁc antibody cetuximab. No signiﬁcant inhibition was
observed for bH1-44, trastuzumab, or bevacizumab. Moreover,
four-in-one antibodies had a superior inhibitory effect on the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Next, we chose MCF-7 cells for which
HRG treatment potently activates the HER2/HER3 pathway in our
assay. Treatment with both FL518 and CRTB6 before HRG stimulation potently inhibited the phosphorylation of HER3 and
markedly decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2
(Fig. 1G). Treatment with MEHD7945A or RG7116 achieved
similar results in the phosphorylation of HER3 but was less
effective in phosphorylating AKT and ERK1/2.
Moreover, we assessed ligand-independent HER2 signaling as
well as VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in BT474
cells. Treatment with FL518 or CRTB6 potently inhibited the autophosphorylation of HER2 (Fig. 1H) and VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Fig. 1I) and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT. MEHD7945A modestly decreased the phosphorylation of HER2 but had no effect on the phosphorylation of
VEGFR2, whereas the bH1-44 had a comparable effect on the
phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and a small effect on that of HER2.
These antibodies were less effective in the phosphorylation of AKT
than the four-in-one antibodies.
Four-in-one antibodies have superior antitumor activity in vitro
and in vivo
Having established FL518 and CRTB6 as potent inhibitors of
EGFR, HER3, HER2, and VEGF signaling, we sought to compare
them with bispeciﬁc antibodies in cell proliferation assays with the
stimulation of EGF, HRG, and VEGF. Thus, in contrast to the
parental antibodies MEHD7945A and bH1-44, we generated
another four bispeciﬁc antibodies (CT9, CB12, RT6, and RB4)
using the KiH methodology and the CrossMab methodology
from cetuximab/trastuzumab, cetuximab/bevacizumab, RG7116/
trastuzumab, and RG7116/bevacizumab (Fig. 2A). Characterization of these bispeciﬁc antibodies shows similar or better inhibition proﬁles than their parental antibodies in our in vitro and in vivo
assays (Supplementary Fig. S2). We chose the human non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H1666 (11) that expresses EGFR,
EGFR ligands, HER2, and HER3 in our cell proliferation assay.
CB12 and bH1-44 did not drastically inhibit cell growth, but a
dose-dependent decrease in proliferation was observed with RB6,
CT9, and RB4. MEHD7945A also exhibited signiﬁcant inhibition

(Continued.) Cell proliferation relative to an untreated control was measured after 7 or 6 days using AlamarBlue staining. D, MTS assay examining the effects of
10 mg/mL of the indicated antibodies on breast or pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in the absence or presence of EGF, HRG, and VEGF (0.5 nmol/L each).

in the cell proliferation assay. However, the greatest inhibition of
cell growth was obtained with the four-in-one antibodies (Fig. 2B).
Intriguingly, four-in-one antibodies potently inhibited cell proliferation at lower antibody concentrations than the combination of
MEHD7945A and bH1-44, and the tetravalent DVD-Ig CRTB6 was
more effective than FL518. The greater potency may be due to the
four-in-one antibodies' unique ability to simultaneously engage
more receptors on the surface of cells. The inhibition mechanism
underlying the tetravalent antibody is hard to predict because it
depends not only on the afﬁnity for the antigens but also on the
local antigen concentration. Similar inhibition results can be observed for H1993 cells, which also exhibited a high level of
expression of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 (Fig. 2C; ref. 25). The combination of MEHD7945A and bH1-44 caused signiﬁcant inhibition
of cell proliferation; however, four-in-one antibodies had a better
inhibition proﬁle.
Next, we performed similar proliferation assays for breast
cancer MDA-MB-231 (high EGFR expression; ref. 36), BT474
(high HER2 expression), and MCF-7 (low HER2 expression)
cells as well as for BxPC3 cells (21), a pancreatic cancer cell line
driven by HER3 activation (Fig. 2D). In MDA-MB-231 cells,
bispeciﬁc antibodies did not exhibit signiﬁcant inhibition, but
the combination of MEHD7945 and bH1-44 had a considerable toxic effect. However, four-in-one antibodies, particularly
the DVD-Ig CRTB6, showed a unique inhibitory effect on these
cells. In BT474 cells, MCF-7 cells and BxPC cells, anti-HER3
antibodies RT6, RB4, and MEHD7945A had better performance
than anti-EGFR/HER2 antibodies or anti-VEGF antibodies,
whereas FL518 inhibited proliferation more potently than
bispeciﬁc antibodies and the combination of MEHD7945A
and bH1-44. CRTB6 exerted the greatest inhibitory effect in
all the cell lines. Taken together, these data suggested that fourin-one antibodies exhibit increased antiproliferative activity
compared with bispeciﬁc antibodies in vitro.
To test four-in-one antibody activity in vivo, BxPC3 cells were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice, and established tumors
were treated once a week with four-in-one antibodies or bispeciﬁc
antibodies. For BxPC3 cells, RT6 inhibited tumor growth by 55%
compared with the vehicle control (P < 0.001; Fig. 2E, left), and
RB4 suppressed tumor growth by 66% (P < 0.05), whereas CT9,
CB12, and RB4 had only marginal effects. bH1-44 had a small
effect and MEHD7945A signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth by
72%, whereas the four-in-one antibody FL518 inhibited tumor
growth by nearly 92% compared with the vehicle control (P <
0.0001), which was even more effective than the combination of
parental antibodies (P < 0.001, MEHD7945A plus bH1-44, TGI
77%). Notably, tumor growth was inhibited nearly 100% with
CRTB6 treatment compared with the vehicle control (P < 0.0001),
and the established tumors were ultimately eradicated in tumorbearing mice.
To further investigate and compare the potency of four-in-one
antibodies with other antibodies in additional xenograft models,
breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were injected subcutaneously into female BALB/c nude mice. In our assay, the
tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts (Fig. 2E, middle) was
inhibited by MEHD7945A (TGI 57%), BH1-44 (TGI 28%), CT9
(TGI 12%), CB12 (TGI 5%), RT6 (TGI 43%), and RB4 (TGI 34%),
whereas the combined blockade in cell signaling caused by FL518
and CRTB6 was most effective in inhibiting tumor growth
(TGI 83% and TGI 97%, respectively). The combination of
bispeciﬁc antibodies did not signiﬁcantly enhance inhibition

164 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

(MEHD7945A plus bH1-44, TGI 66%). Moreover, the tumor
growth of MCF-7 xenografts (Fig. 2E, right) was inhibited by
bispeciﬁc antibodies MEHD7945A (TGI 39%), bH1-44 (TGI
38%), CT9 (TGI 19%), CB12 (TGI 33%), RT6 (TGI 29%), and
RB4 (TGI 22%). Although the combined blockade in cell signaling by a combination of bispeciﬁc antibodies resulted in a gain in
the inhibitory effect [MEHD7945A plus BH1-44 (TGI 50%)],
FL518 was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth (TGI
73%, P < 0.001), and the tetravalent antibody CRTB6 had the
best inhibition rate (TGI 100%, P < 0.00001) of tumor xenografts
in nude mice.
Only four-in-one antibodies have the ability to disrupt
HER/MET crosstalk
The above results showed that simultaneously targeting
several proliferation and survival signals will provide better
clinical outcomes; however, two observations drew our attention. First, more signiﬁcant inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2
signaling was attained using a single agent of four-in-one
antibodies than with any other antibody applied in the same
concentration. Second, in the in vitro and in vivo cancer cell
proliferation assays, four-in-one antibodies, especially DVD-Ig
CRTB6, had a far greater inhibition rate than other antibodies,
even the combination of parental antibodies. These data show
that simultaneously targeting EGFR, HER2, HER3, and VEGF
may involve a mechanism of inhibition other than only
inhibition of the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and
VEGFR2. Interestingly, in MKN45 cells (39) and HCC827 (40)
cells stimulated with EGF and HRG, although phosphorylation
of EGFR, HER2, HER3 could be inhibited by MEHD7945A or
bH1-44, downstream ERK1/2 or STAT3 signaling was not
interrupted (Fig. 3A), even at an extremely high dose (Fig.
3B). Moreover, phosphorylation of receptors was even significantly inhibited by the combination of these two types of
antibodies. Downstream ERK1/2 was only inhibited with an
IC50 value of 18.6 mg/mL, and STAT3 signaling was not
interrupted in MKN45 cells (Fig. 3C). Particularly, phosphorylation of MET, the oncogene that is often coexpressed in
tumors with EGF family receptors, was only inhibited when a
signiﬁcant high dose of a combination of MEHD7945A and
bH1-44 was administered (IC50: 13.5 mg/mL). However, the
inhibition of MET was attained by the four-in-one antibodies
Fl518 and CRTB6 with an IC50 value of 0.37 mg/mL and 0.14
mg/mL, respectively. Downstream phosphorylation of STAT3
occurred with an IC50 value of 0.17 and phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 occurred with an IC50 value of 0.28 mg/mL (Fig. 3D
and E). Accordingly, only four-in-one antibodies have the
unique ability to disrupt the MET/EGFR or MET/HER3 heterodimers in MKN45 cells (Fig. 3F). We concluded that blocking
MET/HER crosstalk is a novel mechanism underlying the
superior inhibition ability of four-in-one antibodies.
A MET/HER signaling shift is crucial for the resistance to
HER-directed therapeutic antibodies
Because anti-HER antibodies cetuximab, trastuzumab, and
pertuzumab are three widely used clinical antibody drugs, we
ﬁrst generated cetuximab-resistant HCC827 cells (ReHCC827)
using previously described methods (40). Next, we modeled the
development of acquired resistance treating the trastuzumabinsensitive breast cancer cell line HCC1954 cells in vivo by exposing xenografts to increasing concentrations of trastuzumab and

pertuzumab to generate dual-resistance cells ReHCC1954. Afterward, we validated the resistant phenotype in vivo and in vitro (Fig.
4A and B). Importantly, although the cancer cell line HCC1954
can be inhibited by trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (Fig. 4B),
cancer cells developed resistance to this current-evaluated treatment strategy in clinic in our assay. Next, we tested phosphotyrosine signaling in parental and resistant cell lines and found that
the amounts of MET, phosphorylation of MET, phosphorylation
of HER3, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and phosphorylation of
STAT3 were signiﬁcantly enhanced in the resistant cells compared
with the parental cells (Fig. 4C). Consistent with this, the resistant
cells showed a dramatic increase in EGFR/MET and HER3/MET
heterodimers (Fig. 4C). In addition, the resistant cells expressed
higher levels of EGF-like ligands (EGF, HRG, BTC, and HGF) than
the parental cells (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that overexpression of MET and EGF-like ligands may be associated with resistant
phenotypes.
Next, we examined the effect of siRNA knockdown of MET on
the resistant cell lines. Transfection of MET siRNA dramatically
downregulated the amount of MET in both cell lines (Fig. 4E).
Treatment with MET siRNA effectively inhibited EGF-induced
MET/EGFR signaling and cell growth (Fig. 4F) in ReHCC827
cells. Our data also showed that treatment with MET siRNA
resulted in effective inhibition of HRG-mediated HER3 signaling
and cell growth (Fig. 4G) in ReHCC1954 cells. In addition, MET
siRNA treatment in both cell lines considerably resensitized
resistant cells to cetuximab or dual trastuzumab and pertuzumab
treatment (Fig. 4F and G). Together, these data further suggest

that enhanced MET/EGFR and MET/HER3 crosstalk and signaling may be acquired antibody resistance mechanisms.
Four-in-one antibodies, but not bispeciﬁc antibodies,
overcome resistance to HER-directed therapeutic antibodies
in vitro and in vivo
Our experiments have established that for cetuximab administration–induced acquired resistance ReHCC827 cells, EGFR
signaling has shifted to EGFR/MET signaling, whereas for
ReHCC1954 cells, HER2/HER3 signaling has shifted to HER3/
MET signaling. Because four-in-one antibodies have been shown
to block MET signaling, inhibiting MET/EGFR or MET/HER3
crosstalk, next we tested whether they could overcome acquired
resistance to the HER direct therapy antibodies. Similar to the
previous result, only four-in-one antibodies potently inhibited
EGF-induced MET/EGFR heterodimerization/signaling and HRGdependent MET/HER3 heterodimerization/signaling as well as
downstream phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and AKT in the
resistant cells (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, the extent of in vitro growth
inhibition by four-in-one antibodies was similar to the parental
and resistant cells, whereas bispeciﬁc antibodies did not show
signiﬁcant inhibition in the resistant cells (Fig. 5B). Four-in-one
antibody treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited the tumor growth in
both established parental and resistant cell tumors in all tumorbearing mice (Fig. 5C), whereas bispeciﬁc antibody treatment
failed to lead to signiﬁcant tumor inhibition. We also showed that
the combination of bispeciﬁc antibodies was signiﬁcantly less
effective than four-in-one antibodies in inhibiting the in vitro

this, the in vivo antitumor activity of the antibodies in combination was much lower than that of four-in-one antibodies in the
resistant xenograft mouse model (Fig. 5B and C).

Discussion
Herein, we provide evidence that a four-in-one antibody,
FL518, generated from two-in-one antibodies, MEHD7945A and
bH1-44, is capable of binding one EGFR and one HER2, one EGFR

and one VEGF, one HER3 and HER2, or one HER3 and one VEGF
simultaneously. Moreover, we generated another four-in-one
DVD-Ig–like antibody, CRTB6, which is capable of binding one
EGFR, one HER2, one HER3, and one VEGF simultaneously. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to describe this type of
antibody. Interestingly, four-in-one antibodies were more active
than all the bispeciﬁc antibodies in all in vitro and in vivo models.
Unexpectedly, our cell signaling assays revealed that four-in-one
antibodies not only exhibited a blocking effect on EGFR, HER2,

HER3, and VEGF signaling but also had the capacity to block HER/
MET crosstalk. Combination use of the anti-EGFR/HER3 antibody MEHD7945A plus the anti-HER2/VEGF antibody bH1-44
has a similar effect but required an extremely high dose. Although
in the DVD-Ig design of four-in-one antibodies, cetuximab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, and a new anti-HER3 antibody RG7116
were used to be comparable with FL518. However, as the efﬁcacy
of adding bevacizumab in anti–HER-targeted therapy has been
controversial and the cardiac safety may also arise as a disadvantage, using other options for this arm may gain more potent
therapeutic biomacromolecules, especially those antibodies that
recently have been suggested to enhance the immune response
of antibody drugs, such as anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab or
anti-CD3 antibody.
Sensitivity to a speciﬁc anticancer agent evolves during administration (8, 39). A variety of compensatory mechanisms may
underlie acquired resistance to EGFR- or HER2-targeted agents,
including switching dimerization partners (7), upregulation of
ligands for HER3 or EGFR (24, 26, 41), or overexpression of
particular receptors, especially HER3, which are identiﬁed as an
evolved response to current anti-HER/ErbB agents needing early
and direct blockade (42). In a previous study, a bispeciﬁc antibody generated from trastuzumab and pertuzumab also supported this hypothesis, overcoming acquired resistance to trastuzumab by effectively blocking HER2/HER3 heterodimerization
(19). Moreover, receptor crosstalk of MET plays a critical role in
the development of resistance to EGFR family inhibitors. Ampliﬁcation of MET occurs in patients with NSCLC who develop
resistance to the RTK inhibitors such as geﬁtinib or erlotinib
(11, 43, 44). In NSCLC cells selected for resistance to geﬁtinib
or erlotinib in vitro, MET is ampliﬁed and activated and stimulates
MET/EGFR or HER3 phosphorylation and signaling to AKT
(11, 25). In Met-ampliﬁed gastric cancer cell lines, EGFR and
HER3 are basally phosphorylated, which is abrogated in the
presence of Met inhibitors (23). Stimulation with both HGF and
EGF promotes downstream activation of several signaling pathways, including AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 (45). Met is also
expressed at elevated levels in HER2-ampliﬁed human breast
cancers, and cooperative signaling between MET and HER2 might
be a mechanism by which MET promotes cancer progression (46).
HER3/MET crosstalk and signaling were observed to play a crucial
role in the resistance to direct HER2 blocking therapy, especially
for the cancer cell lines resistant to the dual therapy of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, which is currently under evaluation in
clinics and has promoted good outcomes (2). Because MET was
proved to be a select partner of HER family members, it is not
surprising that use of anti-HER agents would result in the activation of HER/MET dimerization and signaling. In our present
report, only simultaneous targeting of EGFR, HER2, and HER3
proved efﬁcient to block the crosstalk between HER/MET, and
superiority of four-in-one antibodies was also observed. Although
the combination of two-in-one antibodies to block EGFR, HER2,
and HER3 can also inhibit such crosstalk, four-in-one antibodies
have the unique advantage of low dose.
Direct oncogenic-signal stress through competing with natural
ligands of HERs and inducing blockade of the HER signal pathway, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect
mediated through the Fc portion of the antibody, are the two
mechanisms that underline the antitumor effect of anti-HER
antibodies. However, in our in vivo data, xenografts were using
immunodeﬁciency mice for human cancer cells, we cannot direct-

168 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

ly evaluate ADCC effect between four-in-one antibodies and
bispeciﬁc antibodies. An evaluation of whether targeted antibody
treatment of cancer could reduce tumor burden in syngeneic
wild-type mice (47) is ongoing. Moreover, it is also interesting
that whether other RTK crosstalks may involve in the HER receptors that can be disrupted by novel antibodies, especially recent
evidence had shown that the RTK AXL may be a key mediator of
cetuximab resistance (48), providing a rationale for the cetuximab
usage that would raise the crosstalk between EGFR and other
RTKs. However, a detailed mechanism needs further investigation. In addition, it is well known that binding of cetuximab to
EGFR also resulted in induction of apoptosis, whereas HER2/
HER3 signaling inhibits cell death through the PI3K–AKT– mTOR
pathway. AKT includes three distinct enzymes, each of which is a
member of the protein kinase family that is speciﬁc for serine–
threonine and that inhibits apoptosis. Nevertheless, trastuzumab
alone did not efﬁciently induce cancer cell apoptosis, partly due to
its weak effect on the HRG-dependent HER2/HER3 activation.
However, combined therapy to block HER2/HER3 signaling, such
as trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, is currently under investigation
in clinical use. Thus, four-in-one antibodies, particularly the tetraspeciﬁc, tetravalent antibody, which combined anti-HER antibodies in a single antibody, would amplify the apoptosis effect. All in
all, our data greatly support the hypothesis that simultaneously
targeting more than one proliferation and survival signal or
targeting a resistance mechanism will provide better clinical outcomes. The unique potential of FL518 and CRTB6 to target EGFR,
HER2, HER3, and VEGF to interrupt MET/HER crosstalk and delay
direct anti-HER drug resistance warrants their consideration as
promising anticancer therapies in the clinic.
