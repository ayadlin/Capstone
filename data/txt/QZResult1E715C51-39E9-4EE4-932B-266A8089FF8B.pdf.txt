ABSTRACT
We examined IL-6 effects on growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
process, and metastatic ability of CD133+ and CD133– cell subpopulations isolated
from three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: A549, H157, and H1299. We
developed IL-6 knocked-down and scramble (sc) control cells of A549 and H157 cell
lines by lentiviral infection system, isolated CD133+ and CD133– sub-populations, and
investigated the IL-6 role in self-renewal/growth of these cells. IL-6 showed either
an inhibitory or lack of effect in modulating growth of CD133– cells depending on
intracellular IL-6 levels, but there was higher self-renewal ability of IL-6 expressing
CD133+ cells than IL-6 knocked down cells, confirming the promoter role of IL-6 in
CD133+ cells growth. We then examined tumor growth of xenografts developed from
CD133+ cells of A549IL-6si vs. A549sc cell lines. Consistently, there was retarded
growth of tumors developed from A549IL-6si, CD133+ cells compared to tumors
originating from A549sc, CD133+ cells. The effect of IL-6 in promoting CD133+
self-renewal was due to hedgehog (Hhg) and Erk signaling pathway activation and
higher Bcl-2/Bcl-xL expression. We also investigated whether IL-6 regulates the EMT
process of CD133− and CD133+ cells differently. Expression of the EMT/metastasisassociated molecules in IL-6 expressing cells was higher than in IL-6 knocked down
cells. Together, we demonstrated dual roles of IL-6 in regulating growth of CD133–
and CD133+ subpopulations of lung cancer cells and significant regulation of IL-6 on
EMT/metastasis increase in CD133+ cells, not in CD133– cells.

INTRODUCTION

CSCs are responsible for chemo- [5] and radio-resistance
[6, 7], thus research may reveal potential therapeutic
targets in improving the outcome of NSCLC treatments.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a
broad range of cellular and physiological responses. It
is a pleiotropic cytokine that influences antigen-specific
immune responses and inflammation [8]. In patient sera
of many types of cancers, the IL-6 level is elevated and
suggested to be associated with poor clinical outcome
[9, 10]. The implication of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has
been suggested. Liao et al. [11] showed that a high IL-6
level is associated with shorter overall survival in NSCLC.
Pine et al. [12] observed a correlation between patient
sera level of IL-6 within two years prior to the subsequent
diagnosis of lung cancer. In addition, the circulating

Lung cancer is the predominant cause of cancer
deaths in both men and women [1]. While lung cancer is
heterogeneous in cell types, it is generally divided into
two major subtypes: small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs)
and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), with the
latter comprising 85% of all lung cancer cases [2]. Despite
decades of research and clinical trials testing different
therapeutic interventions, the treatment outcome of lung
cancer remains unsatisfactory.
Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that tumors
contain putative cancer stem cells (CSCs). The existence
of CSCs in lung tumors and in established NSCLC cell
lines has been reported [3, 4]. It has been suggested that

IL-6 level has been suggested as a prognostic marker
for survival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with
chemotherapy [13]. Nevertheless, in analysis of patient
sera or cell lines, inconsistent results were obtained. In
sera analyses, IL-6 was detectable in 29 of 75 patients
with lung cancer (39%) and not detectable in patients
with benign lung diseases [14]. In cell line studies, only
53% of NSCLC cell lines express IL-6 mRNA and protein
[15]. Bihl et al. [16] suggests existence of two subtypes
of NSCLC cells: IL-6-dependent and IL-6-independent.
Meanwhile, recent publications have revealed
a significant association of the IL-6 gene promoter
polymorphism with NSCLC. The IL-6 -174G/C and
174G/G genotypes were suggested as one of the biological
markers in the etiology of NSCLC [17, 18]. The IL-6
antibodies have been already used in in vitro studies
(tocilizumab, [19]), in mouse experiments (siltuximab,
[20]), and Phase I clinical studies (clazakizumab [formerly
ALD518, BMS-945429]) [21].
Recently, several groups reported the role of IL-6 in
promoting CSC growth. Yi et al. [22] showed that the use
of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) led to inhibition of CSC growth,
indicating the IL-6 role in promoting CSC growth. Liu
et al. [23] reported the IL-6 role in enriching lung CSClike cells by epigenetic control of p53 and p21 molecules.
In contrast, the reports on the effects of IL-6 on modulating
total NSCLC cell growth have been controversial. Yamaji
et al. [15] and Bihl et al. [16] did not observe any influence
of IL-6 on NSCLC cell growth, while Takizawa et al. [24]
reported an inhibitory effect of IL-6 on A549 cell growth.
However, Kim et al. [19] reported on the promoter role
of IL-6 in proliferation of several NSCLC cell lines by
showing inhibitory effect of the IL-6 antibody. To clarify
this issue, we were determined to investigate the IL-6
role in CD133+, CSC-like and CD133– non-CSC cells
separately.
Besides the IL-6 role in regulating the growth of
lung cancer cells or CSCs, the IL-6 role in controlling the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process has also
been suggested [25, 26], and the role of IL-6 in regulating
the EMT process in CSCs has never been addressed.
Therefore, we conducted studies on the IL-6 effects on
regulating the EMT/metastasis of CD133+ and CD133–
subpopulation cells.

exhibited biological features of CSCs [27, 28]. Flow
cytometry analysis has confirmed the purity of the isolated
CD133+ cells from the immunomagnetic separation,
with greater than 90% positivity of CD133 expression
cells (Figure 1A). In all three cell lines, CD133+ cells
constituted only a minority of total cells in the parental
cell lines, showing varied percentages from 0.8 to 8.2%.
The H1299 cell line showed the highest percentage
of CD133+ population among the three cell lines. To
examine whether the isolated CD133+ cells had CSC
characteristics, we analyzed expression of the typical
CSC markers Nanog [27, 29], Oct4 [4], Sox2 [27], and
ALDH [29] in parental vs. CD133+ NSCLC cells. High
expression levels of these CSC markers were consistently
detected in isolated CD133+ cells, but not in parental cells
(Figure 1B, quantitation shown in right side panels). The
CD133+ cells did grow in sphere forms in low-adherence
culture conditions in serum-free media supplemented with
growth factors (Figure 1C), as well as grow in spheres
when mixed with Matrigel (Figure 1D). Such anchorageindependent growth is a known characteristic of CSC [30].
Based on these results, we applied the enriched CD133+
and parental (CD133– ) cells as sources of putative CSC
and non-CSCs in subsequent experiments.

Effects of exogenous IL-6 on the growth/selfrenewal of CD133– and CD133+ subpopulations
of NSCLC cells in vitro
We tested effects of exogenous IL-6 on the growth/
self-renewal of the CD133– and CD133+ cells of three
NSCLC cell lines. We detected no significant effect on
the growth of the CD133– cells in the A549 and H157
cell lines, while observing the reduction in the CD133–
cell growth in the H1299 cell line upon IL-6 addition
(Figure 2A). In contrast, we found a significant stimulatory
effect on the self-renewal of CD133+ cells of all three cell
lines in sphere formation assay (Figure 2B).

Effects of silencing endogenous IL-6 on the
growth of CD133– and CD133+ cells
To further investigate the differential effects of
IL-6 on the regulation of the growth/self-renewal of
CD133– vs. CD133+ cells of NSCLC cell lines, we
developed in vitro IL-6 expression-manipulated cell lines.
To select appropriate cell lines for in vitro manipulation
of IL-6 expression, we examined baseline IL-6 expression
levels in the A549, H157, and H1299 NSCLC cell lines.
The ELISA test results showed that A549 and H157 cell
lines secreted IL-6 at high levels, but the H1299 cell
line did not (Figure 3A). mRNA expression levels were
consistent with the result of ELISA assay as shown in
Figure 3B. The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) level in the H1299
cell line was also found to be lower than the other two cell
lines (Figure 3C).

RESULTS
Isolation and characterization of CD133+ cells
from NSCLC cell lines
We have isolated CD133+, CSC-like cell population
of A549, H1299, and H157 NSCLC cell lines by
immunomagnetic separation using the CD133 antibody
conjugated-microbeads. The CD133 molecule is the
most widely used surface marker for the NSCLC CSC,
and previous studies have shown that the CD133+ cells

In vivo examination of the promoter role of IL-6
in CD133+ cells-derived tumor

Using the A549 and H157 cells that express high
basal levels of IL-6, we knocked down the IL-6 levels
via lentiviral transduction. The qPCR test results showed
90–95% IL-6 knockdown efficiency in these two cell lines
(Figure 3D). We then isolated the CD133+ and CD133–
cells from these IL-6 knocked down A549 (A549IL-6si)
and H157 (H157IL-6si) cells as well as their scramble
control (A549sc and H157sc) cells, and analyzed their
growth. We found that growth rates of the CD133– cells
of A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si cell lines were higher than
those of scramble control cells (Figure 3E), suggesting
an inhibitory role of IL-6 in CD133– cell growth. On
the contrary, the self-renewal (sphere formation) of
CD133+ population of the IL-6 knocked down cells was
significantly reduced compared to their control cells
as shown in the sphere formation assay (Figure 3F),
supporting a promoter role of IL-6 in CD133+ cells’ selfrenewal. The contrasting results of IL-6 effects on the
CD133– vs. CD133+ cells support dual effects of IL-6 in
regulating the growth of CD133– (an inhibitory role) and
CD133+ (a promoter role) cells of NSCLC cell lines.

To explore if our in vitro discovery of the promoter
role of IL-6 in the self-renewal of CD133+ cells can be
demonstrated in vivo, we performed investigations using
human tumor xenografts in nude mice. We generated the
in vivo model by subcutaneously inoculating CD133+ cells
(1 × 104), isolated from A549IL-6si (A549IL-6si-CD133+)
vs. A549sc (A549sc-CD133+) cell lines into the bilateral
flanks of mice and monitored tumor growth twice a week.
We inoculated lower number of cells of CD133+ cells in
consideration of the higher tumorigenicity of CD133+
cells than CD133– cells [27]. Indeed, when we inoculated
the same number of CD133– cells (1 × 104), we did not
observe tumor generation (data not shown), supporting the
higher tumorigenicity of CD133+ cells than CD133– cells.
IL-6 expression in CD133+ cells from A549sc and
A549IL-6si CD133+ cells were examined before inoculation
into nude mice. Figure 4A shows immunofluorescence (IF)
stains confirming IL-6 knockdown in the CD133+ cells

corroborated the in vitro finding that IL-6 played a positive
role in promoting the CD133+ cell growth.

isolated from the A549IL-6si cell line to be inoculated
in mice. The growth of xenograft tumors from CD133+
cells derived from A549 sc vs. A549IL-6si cells were
examined. As shown in Figure 4B, we found significantly
retarded tumor growth in xenografts derived from CD133+
cells isolated from the A549IL-6si cell line compared to
xenograft tumors derived from the CD133+ cells of the
A549sc cell line, supporting that intrinsic IL-6 stimulated
CD133+ cell growth in xenograft tumors. Tumors were
subsequently excised from mice (Figure 4C) and H & E
stain confirmed tumor phenotypes of IL-6 expression
(Figure 4D). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with the
proliferation marker Ki67 and the tumors derived from the
CD133+ cells of A549IL-6si cell line showed significantly
reduced Ki67 staining than the tumors derived from the
CD133+ cells of the A549sc cell line (Figure 4E), again
demonstrating reduced proliferation of CD133+ cells in

Mechanistic investigation of signaling pathways
modulated by IL-6 in CD133+ cells
To explore the mechanism involved in the promoter
role of IL-6 on CD133+ cells, we first examined the
activation of several signaling pathways that had been
reported to be important in CD133+ cells for self-renewal,
including Sonic Hedgehog (Hhg) [31], Wnt [32], and
Notch3 [33]. We detected the activation of these signaling
pathways in CD133+ subpopulation for both A549 and
H157 cells when compared with parental cells (Figure 5A).
In addition to these signaling pathways, we also detected
the activation of signaling pathways of Akt, extracellular

signal-regulated kinases (Erk), Stat3, and mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK)
in CD133+ cells compared to the parental cells (Figure
5A). In addition, we found a marked increase of Bcl-2 (an
anti-apoptotic marker) expression in CD133+ cells than
parental cells (Figure 5A). We then investigated whether
IL-6 signaling can further trigger the activation of these
signaling pathways. Western blot analyses were performed
in extracts of A549-IL-6si-CD133+ vs. A549sc-CD133+,
and H157IL-6si-CD133+ vs. H157sc-CD133+ cells (Figure
5B: A549IL-6si-CD133+ vs. A549 sc CD133+; Figure 5C:
H157IL-6si-CD133+ H157 CD133+ cells). The findings
in both cell lines were consistent in that IL6-si CD133+
cells had lower levels of expression of Hhg, p-Stat3,
p-Erk, p-MEK, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1expression when

compared to respective control sc CD133+ cells of both
cell lines. Data suggest that IL-6 expression in CD133+
cells modulates the up-regulation of Hhg, p-Stat3, p-Erk,
p-MEK, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl but has no effect on Wnt,
and also affects the down-regulation of Akt activation.
To further explore if the IL-6 expression-associated
molecular signaling pathways discovered in Figure 5B and 5C
may play a role in the growth and renewal of CD133+ cells,
we applied available molecular inhibitors that specifically
targeted these signaling pathways and investigated their
effects on sphere formation of A549sc-CD133+ cells.
Sphere formation assays were done in the presence of
ABT737 (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor) [34], cyclopamin (Hhg
inhibitor) [35], U0126 (Erk/MEK inhibitor), LY294002
(Akt inhibitor), SB203850 (MAPK inhibitor), and AG490

Effects of IL-6 on the EMT/migration abilities of
CD133– and CD133+ cells

(JAK/Stat3 inhibitor). We observed significantly reduced
sphere numbers of A549sc-CD133+ cells by treatment with
ABT737, cyclopamin, and U0126 (Figure 5D), and the level
of reduction reached the similar level of sphere numbers of
A549IL-6si-CD133+ cells. We did not observe any significant
inhibition of self-renewal of A549sc-CD133+ cells treated
with LY294002, SB203850, and AG490 (Figure 5D).
Combined data from these inhibitor studies suggest that
targeting the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, Hhg, and Erk/MEK signaling
pathways can potentially inhibit the IL-6-mediated CD133+
cell growth enhancement, providing a rationale of applying
strategies by targeting these three signaling pathways, Erk/
MEK, Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, and Hhg, in blocking the growth of
CD133+ cells of NSCLC.

We next investigated whether IL-6 also differentially
regulates the EMT process in CD133+ and CD133– cells.
We isolated CD133– and CD133+ cells from A549IL-6si/
sc and H157IL-6si/sc pairs, obtained cell extracts, and
examined expression of the EMT (E-cad, N-cad, vimentin,
and Twist) and metastasis-associated (MMP9, TGF-β1,
VEGF) molecules in Western blot analyses. We found no
significant regulation in expression of these molecules in
CD133– cell sets, but observed significant IL-6 regulation
in CD133+ cell sets (Figure 6A). We found significantly
higher expression of these molecules in CD133+ cells of

DISCUSSION

the IL-6 expressing A549sc/H157sc cell lines than the
cells of IL-6 knocked down cell lines. The migration assay
results support this finding. As shown in Figure 6B, no
significant difference in migration ability of CD133– cells
was observed whether or not they express IL-6 in cells,
but significantly higher numbers of migrated cells were
detected in the migration test using the CD133+ cells of
sc cells compared to the cells of IL-6 knocked down cell
lines. Differences in these markers were also observed in
immunostaining of tumor tissues obtained in xenograft
studies (Figure 4). When we stained tumor tissues of
CD133+, A549IL-6si- andCD133+, A549sc-xenografts
with the EMT/metastasis markers, we observed higher
numbers of cells positively stained with these markers in
tumor tissues of CD133+, A549sc-xenografts than those of
CD133+, A549IL-6si-xenografts (Figure 6C). These results
indicate that the IL-6 effect in promoting the EMT process
in CD133+ cells and increasing their migration abilities
were significant in CD133+ cells, not in CD133– cells.
We also investigated expression of several cell
adhesion-associated molecules, such as CD44 and
integrin. We could not detect the IL-6 regulation of CD44
in both population cell sets, but observed significant
IL-6 regulation in integrin levels in CD133+ cell sets
(Figure 6A). The integrin level was significantly higher
in CD133+ cells of the IL-6 expressing A549sc/H157sc
cells than in the cells of IL-6 knocked down cell lines.
Consistently, we observed aggregation of CD133+ cells
of the IL-6 expressing A549sc/H157sc cell lines in
migration tests.

In this report, we discovered differential roles
of IL-6 in regulation of the growth/self-renewal of two
subpopulation (CD133+ CSC-like, CD133–) cells of
NSCLC cell lines. We found that IL-6 promoted the
self-renewal of CD133+ cells, but inhibited the growth
of CD133– cells. The IL-6 role in promoting growth of
CD133+ cells has been implicated in previous reports
[22, 23], but we revealed the dual roles of IL-6 in these
two subpopulation cells, which clarifies the controversial
issues on the IL-6 role in growth of total cells [15, 16, 24].
Our results with the exogenously added IL-6 on
growth of CD133– cells were not consistent among these
3 cell lines. We detected almost no effect of IL-6 on the
growth of CD133– cells of A549 and H157 cell lines
that bear high basal levels of IL-6, while observing an
inhibitory effect on the growth of CD133– cells of H1299
cell line that did not express IL-6. It is probable that
demonstrating inhibitory effects in cell lines expressing
high levels of IL-6 (A549 and H157) may be difficult.
However, our further experimental approach of in vitro
manipulation of intracellular IL-6 level enabled us to
detect an inhibitory effect of IL-6 on CD133– cell growth
(Figure 3E). This result suggests that the autocrine IL-6
signals may be more critical than the paracrine IL-6
signals in triggering the inhibitory effect.
Contrasting the CD133– cell studies results, our
in vitro and in vivo data clearly showed the promoter role
of IL-6 in regulating the CD133+ CSC-like cells growth.

It may account for the important implication of IL-6 in
lung cancer progression and chemo- and radioresistance.
Mizutani et al. [36] showed that blocking IL-6 increased
chemosensitivity to cisplatin in renal cancer cells, and our
recently published results also showed that IL-6 plays a
role in chemoresistance in NSCLC cells by increasing
DNA repair and blocking apoptosis [37]. Moreover, our
data using the CD133+ and CD133– cells of A549 and
H157 cell lines showed that CD133+ cells have higher
resistance than CD133– cells to cisplatin treatment
(unpublished results), so we speculate that the role of
IL-6 in chemoresistance may be more critical in CD133+
cells than in CD133– cells. In addition, recent studies
in our laboratory revealed the importance of IL-6 in
rendering radioresistance to CD133+ cells of lung cancer
(manuscript in press). Therefore, although CD133+ cells
comprise only a minority portion of cells in the parental
cell lines (0.8–8.2% Figure 1A), we believe that the IL-6
role in promoting CD133+ cell growth may be important
and have high clinical significance.

However, tumor tissues are thought to be hetero­
geneous in IL-6 expression as the previous results on
NSCLC cell lines indicated IL-6 expression in only 53%
of NSCLC cell lines among the NSCLC cell lines tested
[15, 16] and the report on patient tumor tissues also
showed heterogeneous expression of IL-6 in lung tumor
tissues [14]. In addition, the IL-6 role in the milieu of the
tumor microenvironment is considered clinically important
because there is a report indicating the interaction of IL-6
with other molecules in affecting these cells’ growth [38].
Therefore, it will be necessary to isolate CD133+ and
CD133– cells from tumor tissues and investigate the IL-6
role to understand the IL-6 effect on growth of CD133+
and CD133– cells.
We next showed that the IL-6 expressing CD133+
cells have significantly higher expression of EMT-related
molecules (lower E-Cad, higher N-Cad, vimentin, and
TWIST), as well as higher expression of metastasis-related
molecules (MMP9, TGF-β1) than IL-6 knocked down
CD133+ cells (Figure 6A). The IL-6 effect was slightly

observed in CD133– cell sets, but the effect was not as
significant as in CD133+ cell sets. These in vitro data were
also proved in in tumor tissue analyses.
TGF-β1 is also suggested to be important in inducing
the EMT process [39] and we observed higher expression
of this molecule in the IL-6 expressing CD133+ cells than
IL-6 knocked down CD133+ cells. VEGF has been known
to be involved in angiogenesis process [40], but a recent
publication showed that VEGF is important in migration
of mesenchymal stem cells [41]. Therefore, we speculate
that the IL-6-mediated high expression of VEGF may also
contribute to the increased migration ability of CD133+ cells.
It is interesting to note that the IL-6 expressing
CD133+ cells showed aggregation in the migration tests
(Figure 6B). In investigating several adhesion-associated
molecules, we found integrin is highly expressed in the
IL-6 expressing CD133+ cells compared to the IL-6
knocked down CD133+ cells, but not much difference
was detected in CD44 level. As the aggregated tumor
cells were suggested to bear higher metastatic ability than
non-aggregated cells [42], we believe the IL-6 regulation
of aggregation of CD133+ cells may also have a clinical
significance and further studies are thought to be necessary.
The anti-IL-6 strategy is expected to be effective on
blocking growth and EMT/metastatic abilities of CD133+
cells. It has been suggested in lung cancer therapeutics and
already been applied in clinical trials [21, 43]. However,
using anti-IL-6 therapy to target the growth of CSC and
CSC-derived EMT/metastasis has never been attempted.
In addition, given the complexity of the physiological
activities of IL-6 in producing both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in the immune system [44], any
therapeutic approach using anti-IL-6 agents may result in
complicated and unforeseen untoward outcomes. In this
respect, selectively targeting IL-6 downstream signaling
may be a better strategy than anti-IL-6 agents and this
strategy may come from the result of our mechanistic
investigation. In the mechanism dissection studies on
revealing signaling pathways responsible for the IL-6
role in promoting CD133+ cells growth, we found several
signaling pathways including Hhg, Wnt, and Notch that
were up-regulated in CD133+ cells compared to total
cells. We also found that IL-6 knockdown decreased
the expression of Hhg, p-stat 3, p-Erk, p-MEK, Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, but not the Wnt and p-Akt signaling
(Figure 5). Further inhibitor studies confirmed that Hhg,
Bcl-2, and Erk/MEK are the essential signaling pathway
or molecules in triggering the promoter role of IL-6 in
CD133+ cell growth. Su et al. [45] earlier suggested that
IL-6 modulated Hhg signaling in leukemia, but our finding
of IL-6 modulation of Hhg signaling in CD133+ CSClike cells of NSCLC has not been reported previously.
Activation of Bcl-2 has been reported in prostate CSC
studies [46], but its activation and the regulation by IL-6
signaling in lung cancer CSCs have not been addressed
before. Taking together findings from our mechanism
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies, our data suggest that Hhg, Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, and Erk/
MEK are important target molecules in triggering the IL-6
effect on promoting CD133+ cell growth and expansion.
In lung cancer therapeutics, a pilot trial of combined use of
anti-Bcl-2 G3139 antisense oligonucleotide and paclitaxel
has been applied [43], but no objective responses were
observed. Likewise, the therapeutic approaches targeting
Hhg pathway have also been proposed in several types
of cancers, including lung cancer [47], but effects of
therapies blocking these two signaling pathways to retard
CSCs growth have never been tested in the clinical setting.
Nonetheless, we did not investigate possible
regulation of IL-6 on other signaling pathways, such as
IGF and NFκB, which were also reported to be important
in CSC growth in other cancers in this study. On the other
hand, the IL-6 regulation of epigenetic modification was
also reported to be important in CSC growth [23]. We
speculate that IL-6 can modulate several different ways to
control CSC growth and through the signaling pathways
we revealed in this study may be one of them.
To reveal target molecules in triggering the IL-6
effect in increasing the EMT/metastasis and aggregation of
CD133+ cells, we may need further mechanism dissection
studies. However, we speculate that integrin may be one of
the IL-6 downstream molecules we may consider to target
to block the CSC-mediated metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
A549, H1299, and H157 cell lines were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS.
CD133+ CSCs were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with ITS (insulin, transferin, selenium,
Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), and 20 ng/ml FGF
(Invitrogen). All cells were maintained in a humidified 5%
CO2 environment at 37°C.
For inhibition studies of sphere formation of
CD133+ cells, we applied the inhibitors LY294002
(10 µM, Sigma, St Louis, MO), SB203850 (10 µM,
Sigma, St Louis, MO), AG490 (5 µM, Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA), U0126 (10 µM, Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA), ABT737 (0.1 µM, Selleckchem Houston, TX), and
cyclopamine (5 µM, Selleckchem Houston, TX) that
inhibit Akt, MAPK, and JAK/Stat3, Erk/MEK, Bcl-2, and
Hhg signaling pathways, respectively.

Isolation of CD133+ CSC-like cells using
microbead immunoseparation
Cells (2 × 107) were detached from tissue culture
plates with 5 mM EDTA, centrifuged, and incubated
with magnetic microbeads conjugated with anti-CD133
antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Cambridge, MA). The bead6634

bound cells (CD133+) and unbound cells (CD133–) were
separated in QuadroMACS™ Separation Unit (Miltenyi
Biotec, Cambridge, MA). The purity of the isolated
CD133+ cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analyses,
and by Western blot analyses. The isolated CD133+ cells
were cultured in stem cell media as described above.

CFX96 system with SYBR green to determine the mRNA
expression level of a gene of interest. Expression levels
were normalized to GAPDH level.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL
aprotinin, 0.2 mM PMSF) and proteins (20–40 µg) were
separated on 8–10% SDS/PAGE gel and then transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After
the blocking procedure, membranes were incubated
with primary antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies, and visualized in Imager (Bio-Rad) using
ECL system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY).
GAPDH, bcl-2, bcl-xL, Notch, Hhg, Wnt1, CD44, and IL6R antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). CD133 antibody was from Miltenyi Biotec
(San Diego, CA), and ALDH antibody was obtained
from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). p-Stat3, p-Akt,
p-Erk, p-MEK, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Mcl-1 antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The
antibodies of E-cad, N-cad, Twist, MMP9, and TGF-β1
were obtained from Abgent (San Diego, CA) and Integrin
and VEGF antibodies were purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK).

Plasmids and cell infection using lentiviral
system
For the incorporation of IL-6 siRNA or scrambled
control plasmids into A549 and H157 cells, lentiviral
plasmids carrying either control (scramble) or IL-6
siRNA (pLenti-II vector) (Applied Biological Materials
Inc, Canada) sequence were transfected into 293T cells
as a mixture of pLent-II-IL-6 siRNA, psPAX2 (viruspackaging plasmid), and pMD2G (envelope plasmid)
(4:3:2 ratio) using PolyFect Transfection reagent (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). The virus supernatants were infected
into A549 and H157 cells and the positive cell clones
were selected by puromycin (2 μg/ml) (Sigma) and then
maintained in media containing 0.1 μg/ml puromycin.

Growth assay and sphere formation assay
CD133– cells or total cells of A549, H1299, and
H157 cell lines were seeded into 24-well plates (1 × 104
cells/well) and cell growth at different time points (days
2, 4, and 6) was analyzed by cell counting. For sphere
formation assay, single-cell suspensions (1 × 103 cells) were
mixed with cold Matrigel (BD, Franklin Lakes) (1:1 ratio,
v/v, total volume of 100 µl)) and the mixture was placed
along the rim of the 24-well plates. The culture plates were
placed in 37°C incubator for 10 min to let the mixture
solidify and 500 µl medium was then added into the wells.
In testing inhibitor effects, appropriate concentration of
individual inhibitor was added into the medium. Sphere
numbers of higher than 50 µm in diameter were counted
after 7–14 days under an Olympus light microscope. A
minimum of three triplicate experiments were performed.

Migration assay
Cells (CD133– and CD133+ cells isolated from
A549IL-6si/sc and H157IL-6si/sc pairs, 1 × 104) were
placed in upper layer of transwell plates (Corning, 8 μm
pore size, 24 well plates, no serum containing media).
Migrated cells at the end of 24 hours of incubation were
visualized by staining with crystal blue solution and counted
under microscope. Three independent experiments (with
triplicates) were done and quantitation was obtained from
average numbers of positively stained cells in 3 phases.

In vivo xenograft studies

IL-6 ELISA

The CD133+ cells (1 × 104 cells per site) that had
been isolated from A549sc (control group) and A549IL-6si
(test group) cell lines were subcutaneously injected (100 µl
total injection volume, mixture of 1:1, media: Matrigel,
v/v) into 8-week old female nude mice (NCI) (10 mice
per group for a total of 20 mice). Tumor development and
growth were monitored twice a week.

IL-6 in the supernatant of A549, H157, H1299,
A549sc, A549IL-6si, H157sc, and H157IL-6si cell
lines was determined by the ELISA kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD, Franklin Lakes). The
secreted IL-6 level was normalized by cell number.
