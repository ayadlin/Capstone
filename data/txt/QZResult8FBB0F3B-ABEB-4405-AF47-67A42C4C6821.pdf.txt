Abstract
Cancer cells use stress response pathways to sustain their
pathogenic behavior. In breast cancer, stress response–associated
phenotypes are mediated by the breast tumor kinase, Brk (PTK6),
via the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1a and HIF-2a. Given that
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is highly expressed in triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), we investigated cross-talk between stress
hormone–driven GR signaling and HIF-regulated physiologic
stress. Primary TNBC tumor explants or cell lines treated with
the GR ligand dexamethasone exhibited robust induction of Brk
mRNA and protein that was HIF1/2–dependent. HIF and GR
coassembled on the BRK promoter in response to either hypoxia
or dexamethasone, indicating that Brk is a direct GR/HIF target.

Notably, HIF-2a, not HIF-1a, expression was induced by GR
signaling, and the important steroid receptor coactivator PELP1
was also found to be induced in a HIF-dependent manner.
Mechanistic investigations showed how PELP1 interacted with
GR to activate Brk expression and demonstrated that physiologic
cell stress, including hypoxia, promoted phosphorylation of GR
serine 134, initiating a feed-forward signaling loop that contributed signiﬁcantly to Brk upregulation. Collectively, our ﬁndings
linked cellular stress (HIF) and stress hormone (cortisol) signaling
in TNBC, identifying the phospho-GR/HIF/PELP1 complex as a
potential therapeutic target to limit Brk-driven progression and
metastasis in TNBC patients. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1653–63. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

types such as growth factor–induced cell migration, anchorageindependent growth, modulation of EMT markers, metastasis,
and resistance to targeted therapies (2, 7, 9–13). Although precocious Brk expression clearly enhances aggressive breast cancer
biology (14), a thorough understanding of the mechanisms
driving persistent Brk overexpression is lacking.
We demonstrated robust Brk induction following physiologic
cell stress stimuli, such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and
reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 2), mediated by the hypoxiainducible factors (HIF), HIF-1a and HIF-2a, master regulators of
responses to physiologic cell stress (15). Although triple-negative
breast cancers (TNBC) lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER)
and progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is
highly expressed in 15% to 40% of TNBC tumors (16–18). GRs
are members of the nuclear steroid receptor family and bind
glucocorticoids (GC). GCs have diverse cell type–speciﬁc effects,
promoting apoptosis in cells of lymphoid origin and conversely
promoting survival in cells of epithelial origin (19, 20). In solid
tumors, GR/GCs are emerging as mediators of cell survival and
resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell death (21, 22), and GR
expression is predictive of decreased survival and increased risk of
metastasis in ER breast tumors (18).
Herein, we report Brk induction via GR/GC and HIF signaling
cross-talk. Our studies demonstrate a novel mechanism of integration of physiologic cell stress (HIF-dependent) and stress
hormone (cortisol)–driven pathways, epigenetic signaling events
that may drive persistent aggressive tumor cell behavior. Targeting
the inducible mediators of tumor progression may lead to
increased longevity for breast cancer survivors subjected to
chronic therapy during management of metastatic disease.

Breast tumor kinase (Brk), also known as protein tyrosine
kinase 6 (PTK6), is a soluble tyrosine kinase, distantly related to
the c-Src family kinases (1). Although Brk is absent or low in cell
line models of normal mammary epithelial cells (2), recent
studies show that Brk is elevated but activated (i.e., phosphorylated) and membrane-localized in cancer relative to normal
tissues (3). Although Brk undergoes modest to high-level gene
ampliﬁcation in breast tumors (cBioPortal), Brk is most frequently upregulated at the mRNA level (4–6), with highest protein
levels in advanced tumor grades (7, 8). Brk is activated downstream of multiple growth factor receptors, including MET, EGF
receptor, and ErbB2, and confers aggressive breast cancer pheno-

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 cell lines were obtained in April 2012 from a
collaborating laboratory (Dr. Roland Wenger, Institute of Physiology and Zürich Center for Integrative Human Physiology
(ZIHP), University of Zürich, Z€
urich, Switzerland) and cultured,
and stable knockdown of HIF1A and HIF2A genes was generated
as previously described (2). The MDA-MB-231 cell lines were
authenticated on December 8, 2015, by ATCC, and results were
compared with the ATCC short-tandem repeat (STR) database.
Hs578T and BT20 cell lines were obtained in April 2012 from a
collaborating laboratory (Dr. Doug Yee, Masonic Cancer Center,
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) and cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were
maintained in 5% CO2 at 21% O2 (normoxia, ambient air) or at
1% O2 (hypoxia).
Human breast cancer explant experiments
Fresh breast cancer tissues were obtained with informed consent from women undergoing surgery at the Hospitals of the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX; see
Supplementary Table S1 for clinicopathologic characteristics).
The procedure for establishment of explant followed the previous
description (23). The tissues were also either incubated with
vehicle (ethanol) alone or dexamethasone (10 mmol/L) and were
cultured in a sterile 5% CO2 incubator at 37 C for 24 hours, then
harvested by snap freezing for protein extraction or preserved in
RNAlater (Invitrogen) for gene expression analyses.
Immunoblotting
For experiments without hormone treatment, cells were plated
and treated 24 hours later with 1% O2 for 6 or 24 hours or 100
mmol/L H2O2 for 1 hour. For experiments requiring hormone
treatment, cells were starved for 18 to 24 hours in iMEM with 10%
DCC, then cells were treated, if applicable (treatment conditions
noted in Figure legends), and whole-cell lysates were isolated as
described previously (2) and probed with primary antibodies: Brk
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1188), GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1003), actin, ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology,
9102L), HIF-1a (Novus Biologicals, NB100-479), HIF-2a (Novus
Biologicals, NB100-122), p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology,
9212), phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, 4511p),
phospho-S134 GR (custom made, Pierce Biotechnology), or
PELP1 (Bethyl Laboratories, A300-180A). Representative images
of triplicate experiments are shown. Densitometry was determined via ImageJ analysis and normalized to the loading control.
qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR assays were conducted as described previously (2),
with MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in normoxia or hypoxia with or
without 1 mmol/L dexamethasone or ethanol vehicle for 1 to 24
hours. Target gene expression was normalized to the expression of
internal control genes, TATA-binding protein (TBP), Actin, or 18S.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted as described previously (2), with MDA-MB-231 cells
treated with 1 mmol/L dexamethasone or ethanol at either normoxia or hypoxia for 1 hour. ChIP–ReChIP assays were performed; ﬁrst immunoprecipitating with a GR antibody for 4 hours

1654 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

and subsequently immunoprecipitating was a HIF-2a antibody
overnight (18 hours).
Coimmunoprecipitation assays
Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed as
described previously (24). Brieﬂy, MDA-MB-231 or HeLa cells
were plated and starved (described above) before a 1-hour dexamethasone (1 mmol/L) or H2O2 (100 mmol/L) treatment. Cells
were lysed with ELB buffer and lysates were analyzed as described
previously.
Soft agar assays
Soft agar experiments were performed as described previously
(25), and results presented are representative of three experimental repeats. Treatment conditions included 10 nmol/L doxorubicin, 1 mmol/L dexamethasone, or both.
Gene expression analysis
Results are represented as means  SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance
for qRT-PCR and ChIP-qPCR assays was determined via unpaired
Student t tests. PELP1 expression was explored among The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast tumor samples stratiﬁed by clinical
IHC triple-negative status (88 TNBC, 434 non-TNBC; ref. 26). The
published TCGA median-centered expression data were downloaded and quantile normalized. PELP1 expression levels were
plotted along with their mean  95% CI. Welch two-sample t test
was performed between the groups.

Results
Glucocorticoids induce Brk in TNBC
In addition to our ﬁnding of Brk upregulation via cellular
stressors that input to HIF stabilization (2), we sought to investigate Brk regulation by another primary stress-sensing axis, GR/
GC signaling. TNBC tumor samples were obtained immediately
following surgical resection (Supplementary Table S1). Uniform
sets of fresh tumor fragments were maintained on gelatin sponges
suspended in media containing vehicle or dexamethasone, a
synthetic GC. Notably, 5 of 7 (71%) TNBC tumors showed robust
induction of Brk mRNA (and protein) following dexamethasone
treatment (24 hours) relative to vehicle-treated internal (i.e., same
tumor) controls (Fig. 1A). Brk mRNA expression remained
unchanged following dexamethasone treatment in one tumor
explant, whereas another showed decreased Brk mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). Brk protein and mRNA induction relative to vehicle
control are shown for two representative explants (Fig. 1B).
Interestingly, GR protein was also induced in 3 of 4 explants
following dexamethasone treatment; two representative explants
are shown (Fig. 1B).
To investigate the mechanism of Brk induction by GC signaling,
we utilized cell line models of TNBC. MDA-MB-231 cells, which
express GR but lack ER or PR, were treated with increasing doses of
dexamethasone for 24 hours. Brk mRNA was signiﬁcantly
increased in response to 1 mmol/L dexamethasone treatment
relative to vehicle (Fig. 1C). Similarly, Brk mRNA was signiﬁcantly
increased in response to dexamethasone treatment in Hs578T and
BT-20 TNBC cell lines. Brk protein was also dose dependently
induced in response to dexamethasone and over a time course
that peaked at 24 to 30 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Our remaining dexamethasone studies were performed using
1 mmol/L dexamethasone, a physiologically relevant dose (27,
28) that is standard in the GR ﬁeld (29). Together, these data

indicate that GR/GC signaling induces Brk expression in primary
human TNBC tumors and cell lines.
GR requires HIFs to induce Brk
To determine whether HIFs are required for GR/GC–induced
Brk expression, we utilized MDA-MB-231 cells expressing a nontargeting control shRNA (shControl) or shRNAs speciﬁc to both
HIF-1a and HIF-2a, resulting in a double knockdown (HIF1/2shRNA) of HIF-1a and HIF-2a. MDA-MB-231 shControl and
HIF1/2-shRNA cells were cultured in normoxia or hypoxia and
treated with vehicle or dexamethasone for 24 hours, and Brk
mRNA expression was assessed via qRT-PCR. MDA-MB-231
shControl cells, but not HIF1/2-shRNA cells, signiﬁcantly induced
Brk expression following dexamethasone treatment compared
with vehicle (Fig. 2A; right). GR mRNA expression was unaltered
between cell lines, and the known GR target gene serum and
glucocorticoid–regulated kinase 1 (SGK-1) was similarly dexamethasone-regulated in both shControl cells and HIF1/2-shRNA
cells (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that ligand-activated GR requires
HIF-1a and/or HIF-2a to induce robust Brk mRNA expression.
The BRK promoter contains a glucocorticoid response element
(GRE) present 852 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start
site, near a known hypoxia response element (HRE), to which we
previously demonstrated recruitment of both HIF-1a and HIF-2a
during hypoxia (2). ChIP assays showed robust recruitment of
GR to the GRE in the BRK promoter following dexamethasone
treatment in either cell line model relative to vehicle treatment
or IgG-negative controls (Fig. 2C). These data suggest Brk is a

www.aacrjournals.org

direct GR target gene. Ligand-activated GR is also recruited to the
BRK promoter in dexamethasone-treated HIF1/2-shRNA cells,
although Brk mRNA is not induced, suggesting that HIFs are
required for GR/GC coactivation of transcription or other downstream event(s) subsequent to GR recruitment to this region of
chromatin.
HIF-2a is a novel GR target gene in TNBC
To test the dependence of HIF-induced Brk expression on GR/
GC signaling, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in hypoxia or
normoxia with or without dexamethasone or the GR antagonist,
RU486. As described above (Fig. 1), Brk mRNA was signiﬁcantly
induced in response to dexamethasone treatment, but blocked by
the GR antagonist RU486 as expected (Fig. 3A). Brk mRNA was
signiﬁcantly increased in response to hypoxia alone, relative to
normoxia, and was further induced upon dexamethasone treatment during hypoxia. Interestingly, when MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with hypoxia, dexamethasone, and RU486 simultaneously, Brk mRNA expression returned to levels seen in hypoxic
conditions but were not further reduced to the basal expression
levels observed during normoxia. Thus, while GR/GC–induced
Brk expression requires HIFs (Fig. 2A), HIFs induce Brk during
hypoxia independently of ligand-activated GR (Fig. 3A).
Although the expression of HIF-1a/2a is canonically regulated
by oxygen tension through proteasomal degradation, cancers
frequently utilize alternative methods to inappropriately stabilize
HIFs (30, 31). We speculated that GR may regulate HIFs in TNBC
cells as a means of "presetting" the components necessary for

rapid upregulation of select target genes, including Brk. To test
this, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with or without dexamethasone and hypoxia and as expected, HIF-1a and HIF-2a protein
levels were substantially induced in hypoxia relative to normoxia.
Surprisingly, HIF-2a, but not HIF-1a, protein levels were
increased in response to dexamethasone relative to vehicle controls. Alone, dexamethasone or hypoxia signiﬁcantly induced
HIF2A mRNA expression relative to vehicle (Fig. 3B), and combination treatment resulted in additive induction. Similar results
were observed in Hs578T TNBC cells (Fig. 3C). To determine
whether HIF-2a was a direct GR target gene, we performed ChIP
assays to a GRE present in the HIF2A (EPAS1) promoter in MDAMB-231 cells following dexamethasone and hypoxia treatment
and observed robust recruitment of GR in response to dexamethasone treatment compared with vehicle (Fig. 3D). Interestingly,
ligand-independent recruitment of GR was observed during hypoxia relative to normoxia and may account for the modest, but
signiﬁcant, increase in HIF2A mRNA observed during hypoxia
(Fig. 3B). These data indicate that GR directly binds the EPAS1
promoter prior to induction of HIF2A mRNA in both liganddependent and -independent conditions.
HIF-1a/2a are recruited to multiple active regions of the BRK
promoter in response to physiologic cell stress stimuli (2). To
determine whether GR and HIF-2a were present in the same
transcriptional complexes at the BRK promoter in response to
hypoxic cell stress and stress hormone exposure, we performed
ChIP-ReChIP assays. Following ﬁrst-round immunoprecipitation
(IP) with an antibody speciﬁc to GR, and subsequent IP with an
antibody speciﬁc for HIF-2a, we detected strong corecruitment of
these transcription factors to the BRK promoter following combined dexamethasone and hypoxia treatment and relative to
vehicle controls (Fig. 3E). Thus, GR and HIF-2a interact in the
same transcriptional complexes at the BRK promoter following
dexamethasone and during hypoxia.
PELP1 interacts with GR to induce Brk expression
Common signaling pathways may exist across diverse hormone-driven cancers. We thus considered common SR coactivators in our models of TNBC. Proline glutamate and leucine-rich
protein 1 (PELP1/MNAR) is a known SR coactivator, with important functions in prostate and breast tumor biology and progression (32). PELP1 mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly higher in
TNBC tumors compared with non-TNBC breast tumors (Fig.
4A). We thus evaluated PELP1 protein expression in our ex vivo
tumor explant models (as in Fig. 1). Tumor samples (patient #5)
were treated with increasing doses of dexamethasone, and PELP1
protein was highly induced following 10 mmol/L dexamethasone
treatment relative to vehicle (Fig. 4B). Notably, in the same tumor,
Brk and GR protein levels were also robustly induced following
dexamethasone treatment. In total, PELP1 was clearly dexamethasone-induced in 4 of 7 tumor explants and tracked with GR
induction. Conversely, we observed no increase in PELP1 mRNA
or protein following dexamethasone treatment of TNBC cell line
models, perhaps due to already high basal PELP1 expression.
Alternatively, tumor stromal components may be required for
stable dexamethasone-induced PELP1 upregulation (Fig. 4B).
Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors of TNBC had significant enrichment for HIF-1a and HIF-2a relative to similarly
propagated luminal tumors (2). To investigate the impact of
hypoxia and HIFs on the expression of PELP1 in TNBC cells,
MDA-MB-231 shControl or HIF1/2-shRNA cells were cultured in

normoxia or hypoxia. Interestingly, PELP1 mRNA was signiﬁcantly induced in MDA-MB-231 shControl, but not HIF1/2shRNA (HIF-null) cells cultured in hypoxia relative to normoxia
(Fig. 4C). In addition, basal levels of PELP1 mRNA and protein
were signiﬁcantly reduced in HIF1/2-shRNA cells relative to
shControl cells (Fig. 4C, inset). ChIP assays demonstrated robust
HIF-2a recruitment to an HRE-containing region of the PELP1
promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells in response to hypoxia relative to
normoxia (Fig. 4D). Conversely, recruitment of HIF-1a to this
region was not consistently detected in hypoxia. Taken together,
these data suggest that PELP1 is a HIF-2a target gene in TNBC cells.
We ﬁrst demonstrated ER/PR/PELP1 signaling and transcriptional complexes in luminal breast cancer models (33). However,

no studies have deﬁned a role for GR in PELP1-containing
transcriptional complexes in breast cancer cells. Co-IP experiments performed in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with or without
dexamethasone revealed basal GR interaction with PELP1 that
increased upon dexamethasone treatment relative to vehicle
controls (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed in Hs578T TNBC
cells (Fig. 5B). ChIP assays in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with or
without dexamethasone showed robust PELP1 recruitment to the
GRE located in the BRK promoter following dexamethasone
treatment compared with vehicle (Fig. 5C). Together, these data
indicate that GR and PELP1 interact in whole-cell lysates and are
recruited to the same location in the BRK promoter in response to
dexamethasone treatment. To determine whether PELP1 is
required for dexamethasone-induced Brk expression, MDA-MB231 cells were treated with the PELP1 peptidomimetic inhibitor
D2, which was previously shown to inhibit PELP1/AR interaction
via disruption of protein–protein interactions (23). As seen
previously, dexamethasone treatment resulted in an increase in
Brk mRNA expression, which was signiﬁcantly diminished
when cells were pretreated with D2 prior to dexamethasone
treatment (Fig. 5D). Moreover, ChIP assays demonstrated inhibition of dexamethasone-induced recruitment of both GR and
PELP1 to the Brk promoter in cells subjected to D2 pretreatment relative to dexamethasone treatment alone (Fig. 5E and
5F). Thus, PELP1 is a key cofactor for GR/GC induction of Brk
expression in TNBC cells.

Phosphorylation of GR S134 is important for Brk induction
Ligand-independent phosphorylation of GR occurs at serine
134 (S134) via p38 MAPK in response to physiologic cell stress
stimuli in U2OS osteosarcoma cells (34). We hypothesized that
phosphorylation of GR-S134 provides a mechanistic link between
HIF- and hormone- (GC) mediated cell stress–induced inputs to
Brk upregulation in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with increasing doses of H2O2, and phosphorylation of GR-S134
was visualized by Western blotting using phospho-S134 antibodies. H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of
GR-S134 (Fig. 6A). Notably, we observed constitutive, basal
phosphorylation of GR-S134, as previously observed in U2OS
cells (34), as well as activation of p38 MAPK. To determine
whether GR-S134 is phosphorylated in response to hypoxic cell
stress, MDA-MB-231 cells and HeLa cells were cultured in hypoxia
or with H2O2 as a positive control. Phosphorylation of GR-S134
increased at 6 and 24 hours of hypoxia relative to normoxia in
both cell lines (Fig. 6B), whereas total GR protein levels remained
unchanged. We next assessed the phosphorylation of GR-S134 in
two TNBC PDX cell lines, HCI-2 and HCI-10, previously shown to
have high levels of HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and Brk protein expression
(2). Hypoxia induced robust GR-S134 phosphorylation in both
HCI-2 and HCI-10 TNBC models (Fig. 6C). To determine whether
GR-S134 was phosphorylated in vivo, we measured Brk, phosphoS134 GR, and total GR in primary TNBC patient samples via
Western blotting (Fig. 6D). Patient tumors #8, #10, and #12

To test the requirement for GR-S134 phosphorylation in GR/
PELP1 interaction in TNBC cells, co-IP assays were performed
with MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, increased levels of GR were
seen in PELP1 immunoprecipitates following H2O2 treatment (i.
e., to induce phosphorylation of GR-S134) relative to vehicle (Fig.
6E). To deﬁnitively assess the requirement of this phosphorylation event, co-IP assays were conducted in MDA-MB-231 cells
stably expressing either ﬂag-tagged wild-type (WT) GR (WT ﬂagGR) or a mutant GR, in which S134 was mutated to a nonphosphorylated alanine residue (S134A ﬂag-GR). We observed
decreased PELP1 in S134A ﬂag-GR immunoprecipitates relative
to levels present in WT ﬂag-GR immunoprecipitates, both basally
and in response to dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 6F). These data
suggest that GR phosphorylation at S134 occurs during hypoxic
stress and facilitates or stabilizes GR/PELP1 association.
Highest levels of phosphorylation of GR-S134 were observed
following exposure to H2O2 (i.e., during generation of ROS) in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6). To implicate phosphorylation of GRS134 on dexamethasone-induced GR recruitment to the BRK
promoter, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with or without dexamethasone, H2O2, or both agents, and GR recruitment was
assessed via ChIP assay. As previously seen, GR was recruited to
the BRK promoter following dexamethasone treatment relative to
vehicle. We also detected a slight increase in GR recruitment to the
BRK promoter in the presence of H2O2 alone. Notably, combined

1658 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

dexamethasone and H2O2 treatment further enhanced recruitment of GR to the BRK promoter relative to either dexamethasone
or H2O2 treatment alone (Fig. 7A). We then tested the requirement for p38 MAPK activity in dexamethasone-induced recruitment of GR to the BRK promoter. MDA-MB-231 cells were
pretreated with SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, which effectively blocks phosphorylation of GR-S134 (Fig. 7B; inset), followed by dexamethasone or vehicle treatment. SB203580 pretreatment resulted in diminished basal recruitment of unliganded
GR to the BRK promoter relative to vehicle control (Fig. 7B).
Interestingly, combined treatment with both SB203580 and
dexamethasone substantially decreased GR recruitment to the
BRK promoter relative to dexamethasone alone. These data suggest that inhibition of GR-S134 phosphorylation hinders the
ability of GR to associate with a GRE-containing region of the
BRK promoter. Regulation of two classic GR target genes, DUSP1
and GILZ, remained unaltered in similar conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2C–F); both were robustly dexamethasone-induced in
HIF1/2-shRNA cells relative to vehicle controls (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and B), demonstrating the speciﬁcity of phospho-GRS134 target gene selection.
Finally, to deﬁnitively test the requirement of GR-S134 phosphorylation for recruitment of GR to the BRK promoter, we
performed ChIP assays with MDA-MB-231 cells expressing either
WT ﬂag-GR or S134A ﬂag-GR. As expected, WT ﬂag-GR was
recruited to the BRK promoter following dexamethasone treatment relative to vehicle controls. However, the association of
S134A ﬂag-GR with the BRK promoter was basally reduced and
was not signiﬁcantly increased in response to dexamethasone

relative to vehicle controls (Fig. 7C). These data suggest that
phosphorylation of GR-S134 is required for recruitment of
ligand-bound GR to the BRK promoter. Our data collectively
suggest a mechanism through which PELP1, GR, and HIF-2a
cooperatively induce Brk expression following physiologic (HIF)
and hormone (GC) stress signaling. Indeed, ChIP assays conﬁrmed that all three molecules are simultaneously recruited to the
same region of the BRK promoter in response to stress stimuli in
MDA-MB-231 treated with dexamethasone and H2O2. (Fig. 7D).
To link GR/GC–induced TNBC cell survival to Brk expression, we
performed soft agar assays with MDA-MB-231 cells expressing
shControl, HIF1/2-shRNA (Brk-null), or HIF1/2-shRNAþBrk (in
which Brk expression is restored), grown in the presence of
doxorubicin with or without dexamethasone. MDA-MB-231
shControl cells treated with dexamethasone exhibited signiﬁcantly more colonies per ﬁeld relative to doxorubicin treatment alone
(Fig. 7E). Brk-null HIF1/2-shRNA cells exhibited decreased ability
to form colonies in the presence of doxorubicin and complete loss
of dexamethasone-mediated cell survival. Notably, HIF1/2shRNAþBrk cells exhibited increased colony formation with
doxorubicin treatment relative to Brk-null models, and importantly, the protective effect of dexamethasone treatment was
restored. These data suggest that HIFs are required for GR/GC–
induced cell survival, but that exogenous Brk expression can
bypass this requirement, perhaps in part via reestablishment of
feed-forward signaling (i.e., via Brk-induced activation of p38
MAPK) at additional phospho-S134 GR and PELP1 target genes
(Fig. 7F).

Discussion
Our data demonstrate a remarkable hormone (GC)-dependent signaling pathway, wherein GR-S134 acts as an additional
"stress sensor" of cellular stressors (ROS, hypoxia, etc.) that

www.aacrjournals.org

stabilize HIFs. This phosphorylation event facilitates GR/PELP1
interactions at novel GR/PELP1/HIF target genes typiﬁed by
Brk, an important mediator of advanced cancer phenotypes and
tumor progression. This mechanism of integration of HIFdependent cell stress signaling pathways with GR/GC signaling
suggests that these pathways may overlap more than previously
thought. Notably, many HIF responsive genes have functions
relevant to cancer biology, such as glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell migration (35). HIF-1a overexpression in
breast cancer is predictive of relapse and higher risk of metastasis, and high levels of HIF-1a are speciﬁcally associated with
TNBC (36, 37). Similarly, HIF-2a is emerging as an important
mediator of cancer metastasis (38). Targeting PELP1, HIFs
(including HIF-2a), and/or blocking GR-S134 phosphorylation
via inhibition of upstream p38 MAPK signaling may provide a
means of "redirecting" GR away from genes that promote
prosurvival and tumor progression during cancer chemotherapy while preserving the desired protective (i.e., to inﬂammation) effects of therapeutic corticosteroids.
Remarkably, PELP1 expression is HIF-dependent (Fig. 4C).
PELP1 is primarily associated with ER or androgen receptor
(AR) transactivation but can both transrepress and transactivate
GR in a cell type–speciﬁc manner (39). Our data support a role
for PELP1 as an important GR coactivator. Like GR, PELP1
mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly increased in TNBC compared
with non-TNBC (Fig. 4A). PELP1 expression is dysregulated in
multiple cancer types, including 60% to 80% of breast tumors
(40, 41). Notably, high PELP1 expression in breast tumors is
associated with increased tumor grade, cell proliferation,
metastasis, and decreased disease-free survival, as well as the
appearance of basal cytokeratin markers (40–43). Patients with
PELP1/Ki-67 double high tumors experienced shorter diseasefree survival and overall survival (44). Expression of PELP1 is
inversely associated with expression of ER, PR, or AR (41). Ours

GR S134 is phosphorylated in hypoxia and
required for GR/PELP1 interaction. A, MDA-MB231 cells were treated with vehicle or increasing
doses of H2O2 for 1 hour, and Western blot
analysis was performed with antibodies to
phospo-S134, total GR, phospho-p38 MAPK, or

is the ﬁrst study to link PELP1 expression and function to GR.
Consistent with the concept of GR is a key mediator of
increased TNBC cell survival (Fig. 7E; refs. 18, 29, 45), PELP1
knockdown in mutant p53 TNBC cells enhanced chemotherapy-induced cell death, in part via modulation of gain-offunction mutant p53 activity (46). PELP1 inhibitors are currently in development, primarily for prostate cancer and ER/
PR–positive luminal breast tumors (23). Our studies suggest
that PELP1 inhibitors may have utility in treating aggressive
TNBC, especially in patients whose tumors exhibit PELP1/Ki-67
double high expression (44).
Like Brk (47), GR is a mediator of prosurvival in breast cancer.
TNBC cells treated with combination chemotherapy and dexamethasone, in vitro and in vivo, undergo signiﬁcantly decreased cell
death relative to chemotherapy alone (29). Pang and colleagues
identiﬁed multiple GR target genes that mediate this prosurvival
effect, such as SGK-1 and dual-speciﬁcity serine phosphatase 1
(DUSP1; refs. 29, 45). Relevant to these ﬁndings, increased
phosphorylation of GR at S134 resulted in association of GR
with the adaptor protein 14-3-3zeta and ultimately globally
changed GR target genes in response to dexamethasone treatment
of osteosarcoma cell models (34). Notably, as with Brk, GR,
PELP1, and HIFs, expression of 14-3-3zeta is also very high in

1660 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

TNBC (i.e., as determined via TCGA analysis), suggesting that
these molecules cooperate to alter gene expression and cell fate
in TNBC. Our current study identiﬁes phospho-S134 GR as a
critical regulator of novel GR/PELP1/HIF complexes. We suspect
that phospho-S134-GR/PELP1/HIF signaling complexes are markers of aggressive tumors and drive a new gene program to
promote tumor cell prosurvival and progression to metastasis.
As Brk is known to promote these aggressive phenotypes, it is
likely a key downstream effector of GR/HIF–dependent stress
signaling in TNBC.
Brk may be representative of a larger gene program that is
jointly regulated by HIFs, phospho-GR, 14-3-3zeta, and PELP1.
Going forward, it will be important to identify risks associated
with GC-based therapies. Breast cancer patients typically receive
high-dose GC treatment prior to chemotherapy to alleviate
adverse side effects. Furthermore, organ transplant patients chronically treated with GCs to achieve immunosuppression (48)
experience greatly increased rates of metastatic melanoma (49),
an aggressive cancer that is typically Brkþ (50). Thus, a detailed
understanding GR/GC signaling in cancer biology and its impact
on aggressive tumor phenotypes is urgently needed. Our studies
demonstrate a novel feed-forward loop, in which components of
the stress pathways (p38 MAPK, Brk, HIFs, GR, and PELP1)
