ABSTRACT:
The high intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of many types of cancers, including
breast cancer (BC), poses great challenge to development of subtype-specific
prognosis. In BC, the classification of tumors as either ERα+ (Luminal A and Luminal
B), HER2+ (ERα+ or ERα-) or triple-negative (TNBC)(Basal-like, claudin-low) guides
both prognostication and therapy. Indeed, prognostic signatures for ERα+ BC are
being incorporated into clinical use. However, these signatures distinguish between
luminal A (low risk) and Luminal B (high risk) BC; signatures that identify low/
high risk patients with luminal B BC are yet to be developed. Likewise, no signature
is in clinical use for HER2+ or TNBC. The major obstacles to development of robust
signatures stem from diversity of BC, clonal evolution and heterogeneity within each
subtype. We have recently generated a prognostic signature for HER2+:ERα- BC based
on the identification of genes that were differentially expressed in a tumor-initiating
cell (TIC)-enriched fraction versus non-TIC fraction from a mouse model of HER2+
BC (MMTV-Hers/Neu). Here we describe the rationale behind development of this
prognosticator, and present new features of the signature, including elevated PI3K
pathway activity and low TNFalpha and IFNgamma signaling in high-risk tumors.
In addition, we address controversies in the field such as whether random gene
expression signatures significantly associate with cancer outcome. Finally, we suggest
a guideline for development of prognostic signatures and discuss future directions.

INTRODUCTION

of these tumors may not develop macro-metastases, and
therefore surgical removal alone with local radiation or
hormonal therapy can cure patients. In contrast, other
tumors form distal metastases that are virtually incurable.
The goal of prognostic signatures is to segregate patients
with primary tumors into low and high-risk groups,
thereby identify patients who would benefit from
withholding harsh therapy and those who will benefit from
aggressive intervention.
Heterogeneity within a tumor can affect its
dissemination potential and response to therapy. In
addition, many types of cancer exhibit hierarchical
organization whereby only a fraction of cells, termed
cancer stem cells (CSC) or, as they are operationally

Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease that
includes ERα+ (~65%; luminal A and B), HER2+ (~10%
HER2+:ERα+; ~10% HER2+:ERα-), and triple negative
(~15%; Basal-like, Claudin-low, metaplastic) forms [1].
Luminal A tumors have the best prognosis followed by
luminal B and HER2+:ERα+, with HER2+:ERα-, Basal-like
and Claudin-low having the worst outcome. Patients with
ERα+ tumors are treated with tamoxifen and aromatase
inhibitors [2], HER2+ tumors with chemotherapy plus
anti-HER2 antagonists such as trastuzumab, a monoclonal
antibody directed against HER2 [3-5], whereas TNBCs
are currently treated with chemotherapy alone [6]. Many

defined by transplantation assays, Tumor Initiating
Cells (TICs), sustains growth, whereas the remaining
tumor cells, which descend from TICs, have lost their
tumorigenic potential [7]. Early prognostic signatures
were developed irrespective of this hierarchy or the
diversity of BC. These signatures, such as Oncotype [8],
predict outcome for ERα+ BC, the majority of cases, but
not for HER2+ or triple negative BC [9]. These signatures
also seem to segregate Luminal A (low proliferation,
low risk) from Luminal B (high proliferation, high risk)
patients, but not good/bad prognosis within each subtype.
A second type of prognostic signature was developed
for cancer stem cells (CSC/TICs). Thus, an invasiveness
gene signature (IGS) was generated from CD44+/CD24-/
low
breast TICs isolated from Pleural effusions from
patients with metastatic disease [10]. When analyzed
against several independent cohorts, this signature
scored modestly for ERα+ BC (HR, 2.12) but poorly for
TNBC (HR, 1.08) and HER2+ (HR, 0.96) patients [8].
A third type of prognostic signature was designed for
specific breast cancer subtypes but irrespective of tumor
hierarchy. This includes a stromal-derived prognostic
predictor (SDPP) [11], which we found to be more
predictive for HER2+:ERα+ than for HER2+:ERα- BC [12].
A signature has recently been developed for TNBC, based
on microarray data from whole tumors [13]. A molecular
signature of normal breast epithelial and stromal cells
from Li-Fraumeni syndrome with p53 mutations has
also been established [14]. Whether it predicts clinical
outcome for TNBC or HER2+ BC patients, in which p53
is frequently inactivated, remains to be seen. For a more
detailed discussion of prognostic signatures, mainly for
ERα+ BC, we refer readers to excellent recent reviews [15,
16]. Importantly, none of these signatures were developed
on the basis of TICs for a specific BC subtype. Here
we discuss development of a TIC-derived signature for
HER2+:ERα- BC, some new features of the signature, and
lessons learned in this process.

Generation of a TIC-enriched
signature for HER2+:ERα- BC

independent HER2+ cohorts. Its prognostic power was
independent of other predictors, stratified lymph node+
HER2+ BC into low- and high-risk subgroups, and was
specific for HER2+:ERα- patients (hazard ratio (HR)=5.57;
P=0.002)). Retrospective analyses revealed that patients
with HTICS+ HER2+:ERα- tumors resisted chemotherapy
but responded to chemotherapy plus trastuzumab [12].
HTICS is therefore a promising new prognostic signature
for HER2+:ERα- BC that may be used to identify high-risk
patients that would benefit from anti-HER2 therapy.
Notably,
a
substantial
percentage
of
HTICS+:HER2+:ERα- patients still developed metastasis
(27%) or died (22%) within 4 years post-surgery even
when treated with trastuzumab. HTICS+ patients may
relapse because they are inherently resistant to trastuzumab
and/or are prone to become drug-resistant. HER2+ TICs
depend on HER2 signaling [17]. Therefore HTICS+ tumors
should exhibit increased sensitivity to trastuzumab. On
the other hand, in HTICS+ patients, a high frequency of
TICs with enhanced self-renewal capacity may facilitate
the accumulation of new mutations or epigenetic changes
that can lead to clones with increased drug resistance
(e.g. SRC activation [18]. Alternatively, HTICS+ tumors
may represent a distinct, more aggressive subtype of
HER2+:ERα- BC (see below).

HTICS: proliferation and immune response genes
HTICS included 8 up-regulated (Aurkb, Ccna2,
Scrn1, Npy, Atp7b, Chaf1b, Ccnb1, Cldn8) and 9 downregulated genes (Nrp1, Ccr2, C1qb, Cd74, Vcam1, Cd180,
Itgb2, Cd72, St8sia4). Pathway analysis of these genes,
shown in Fig. 1A-B, classifies HTICS genes into 4 groups
(i) cell cycle progression (Aurkb/Aurora kinase B, Ccna2/
CyclinA2, Ccnb1/cyclinB1, Chaf1b/chromatin Assembly
Factor 1 Subunit B); (ii) immune-response (Scrn1, Npy,
C1qb, CD74, Vcam1, CD180, CD72); (iii) angiogenesis
(Nrp1, Ccr2, Itgb2); and (iv) others (Atp7b, Cldn8,
St8sia4).  Some of these genes, e.g. Aurora kinase B, are
potential therapeutic targets.
We have recently performed gene expression
analysis on human (HER2+ and Basal) BC cell lines, and
confirmed expression of 11 HTICS genes (Aurkb, Ccna2,
Scrn1, Npy, Atp7b, Chaf1b, Ccnb1, Nrp1, Vcam1, Itgb2,
and St8sia4; Fig. 1B). In contrast, analysis of human
peripheral blood monocyte cells revealed expression of
Nrp1, Ccr2, C1qb, CD74, CD180, CD72, and St8sia4.
The composition of HTICS is therefore consistent with
previous reports that improved clinical outcome for HER2+
BC patients correlates strongly with immune response [19,
20]. HTICS may be powerful because it encompasses both
proliferation and immune-response/stromal genes.
The identification of immune related genes in
HTICS is somewhat surprising given that the signature
was developed from lineage-depleted TICs. Indeed, the
generation of a prognostic signature from TICs has the

Cognizant of the complexity of human BC,
we have sought to derive a prognostic signature for
HER2+:ERα- BC using TICs from this subtype. As we
can use transplantation into immune-competent host
to operationally define TICs in the mouse, we chose to
analyze tumors from MMTV-Her2/Neu mice, which
give rise to HER2+:ERα--like mammary tumors, for these
studies. We first identified through transplantation assays
HER2+:ERα- TICs as CD24+:JAG- [12]. TIC frequency
was ~2-4.5%. Next, using differentially expressed genes
between the TIC-enriched fraction and non-TIC fraction
we developed a 17-gene Her2-TIC-enriched signature
(HTICS) that predicted clinical outcome on several

express many informative markers, are intentionally

tumors, we found that the CD24+:JAG1- population was
enriched for TICs, whereas the CD24-:JAG1- doublenegative population contained both mammary epithelial
and stroma cells including immune-cells. The latter was
evident from gene expression profiling and pathway
analysis [12] (Fig. 1). Thus, the presence of contaminating
stroma in the double-negative fraction inadvertently
contributed to robustness of our signature.

informative – whereas biological signatures are directed
(i.e. HTICS+ correlates with poor prognosis). This
constraint would reduce random correlation by a factor of
2. In addition, for signatures that comprise up-regulated
and down-regulated genes, randomness in a specific
direction would be reduced by another factor of 2. Finally,
the Venet et al. manuscript tested for prognostic value
of the 3 unrelated signatures against only one cohort
(NKI). But for a signature to be valuable, it must be able
to predict outcome on multiple independent cohorts.
Thus, if a signature has a genuine biological basis, it
will predict clinical outcome on independent cohorts
whereas a randomly selected signature that performs
well on one cohort will fail on others. Indeed, using a
computer algorithm to optimize signatures on a training
cohort, we identified signatures for HER2+ BC with HR
of over 20, which were completely uninformative when
tested against other cohorts. To directly test our prediction,
we analyzed the “social defeat in mice” signature from
Venet et al. (which gave HR of 2.4 on the NKI cohort),
on multiple BC cohorts. This gave HR of approximately

Ruling out randomness
A recent report by Venet and colleagues state that
most random gene expression signatures are significantly
associated with breast cancer outcome [21]. Specifically,
3 unrelated signatures (e.g. “social defeat in mice”)
were shown to be significantly associated with clinical
outcome of breast cancer patients (P < 0.05). However,
the HRs predicted by these examples were low (2.4, 1.9
and 1.8). Moreover, the signatures were not directed, i.e.
both positive and negative correlations were considered

Figure 2: Weak prognostic power of “Mouse Social Defeat Signature” compared with 1000 random signatures in
HER2+ breast cancer patients. Of the 163 genes in the Mouse Social Defeat (MSD) signature, 148 were found on GPL570 and 127 on

GPL96 platforms. Analysis was performed with 116 HER2+ patients from 2 GPL570 cohorts (GSEs 16446 and 20685 with Overall Survival
(OS) data) and 145 HER2+ patients from 6 GPL96 cohorts (GSEs 2034, 2603, 5327, 6532, 11121, and 25066 with Metastasis-Free Survival
(MFS) data). The MFS cohorts contain 53 HER2+:ER- patients, sufficient for independent analysis. A set of 1000 random signatures with
the same number of genes was generated from atmosphere background noise (random.org) for the OS analysis, and another set for MFS.
We then used SSM algorithm (assuming all genes are up-regulated) to differentiate samples in OS and MFS cohorts. The signatures were
ranked by HR and compared with Mouse Social Defeat Signature (red boxes). The % signatures with significant HR > 2.0 are listed at the
bottom. Comparing to 1000 sets of random signatures, Mouse Social Defeat Signature ranked 124 for HER2+ MFS samples, 363 for HER2+
OS samples, and 368 for HER2+:ER- MFS samples.

~0.8, 1.2 and 1.1 (Fig. 2), demonstrating that at least this
randomly selected signature performs poorly when tested
on independent cohorts.
To test for significance of a candidate signature,
Venet et al., suggested to test 1000 random signatures
of the same composition against the same cohorts, and
determine whether less than 5% of these random signatures
(i.e. p< 0.05) have similar HR. For the “social defeat in
mice”, comparison to 1000 random sequences of similar
structure ranked this signature at 124, 363 and 368 (Fig 2).
In contrast, when such analysis was performed on HTICS,
we found that only 3.3% of 1000 random signatures (with
the same gene composition of HTICS) gave significant HR
of more than 2.0, and importantly, HTICS scored highly in
all cohorts, e.g. 2nd best on HER2+:ERα- patients (Fig. 3).
Thus, for a signature to be valid, both to support
a biological process and to predict clinical outcome, we
suggest the following guideline:
1. The signature should predict clinical outcome on
multiple cohorts with high and significant HR (we suggest
>4).

2. The signature should identify a substantial
number of patients in high/low risk groups (>10% total)
to have clinical utility.
3. A collection of 1000 random signatures of the
same size and composition (up- and down-regulated
genes) should contain less than 5% of signatures that
can predict outcome with similar HR as the candidate
signature.

TIC-derived prognostic signatures and cancer
biology
As TICs sustain tumorigenesis, it seems intuitive
that a tumor with a high percentage of TICs would be
more deadly than a tumor that has relatively fewer TICs. It
is important to note however that we used a TIC-enriched
fraction, not a pure population of TICs. The percentage of
TICs in the CD24+:JAG1- fraction was still <5% and in
most human cancers it is much lower. Thus, the majority
of cells in the “TIC-enriched fraction” are non-TICs.

Figure 3: Comparing the prognostic power of HTICS with 1000 random sets of signatures in HER2+ breast cancer
patients. All HTICS 17 genes (8 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated) were present on both GPL570 and GPL96 platforms. Analysis
was performed with 116 HER2+ patients from 2 GPL570 and GPL96 cohorts (see legends to Figure 2). A set of 1000 random signatures
with the same number of genes (8 genes up-regulated, 9 down-regulated) were generated from atmosphere background noise (random.
org) for OS analysis, and another for the MFS, and then SSM algorithm was employed to differentiate samples in OS and MFS cohorts.
The signatures were ranked by HR and compared with HTICS (blue boxes). The % of signatures with significant HR > 2.0 is listed at the
bottom. Comparing to 1000 sets of random signatures, HTICS ranked 2nd for HER2+ MFS, 12th for HER2+ OS, and 2nd for HER2+:ER- MFS.

Possibly, the actual percentage of TICs may be higher
and underestimated due to death of most TICs following
transplantation. This view implies that TIC frequency as
determined by xenograft assays reflects the hierarchical
organization of cancer cells plus the stochastic survival of
TICs after transplantation. In this case, the TIC enriched
fraction may contain high percentage of TICs, and the
signature may indeed reflect the gene expression profile
of TICs. Alternatively, the TIC-enriched fraction may
comprise low percentage of TICs, and high percentage
of TIC-derived progenitors with similar cell surface
markers; the signature in this case may reflect the gene
expression profile of progenitor cells, which may revert at
low frequency back to TICs [22].
There is strong evidence that the rate-limiting
step in metastasis is formation of macro-metastases at
distal sites, not tumor dissemination (reviewed in [23]).
Since we identified TICs through transplantation assays,
this population has proven ability to regenerate tumors.
Therefore HTICS+ tumors may have many TICs, which
are more likely to self renew, form micro-metastases at
distal sites, and acquire the necessary genetic or epigenetic
alterations required for outgrowth of disseminated lesions.
Indeed, 4 of 8 up-regulated genes in HTICS are directly
involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication and
mitosis (Fig. 1).

CD133+, but only a subclass of CD133+:CXCR4+ cells
located at the invasive front of tumors have metastatic
potential [24]. Thus, ideally signatures should be derived
from a TIC sub-fraction that contains metastatic initiating
cells. Second, the underling assumption of a linear
relationship between primary tumors and their metastases
is not always correct. Recent sequencing and genetic
analyses of paired tumors and metastases reveal that in
certain cases, primary tumors and metastases evolve in
parallel with the latter arising from a small fraction of
primary tumor cells [25, 26]. It remains to be seen whether
in such tumors, a transplantation assay would identify the
same small fraction of TICs that metastasize in human,
i.e. whether the transplantation assay in mice detects
cells that metastasize in patients, or whether even tumor
cells that do not metastasize in human can score as TICs
following injection into immune-compromised mice. In
the latter case, it would seem impossible to generate useful
prognostic signatures on the basis of enriched TICs.
Third, highly heterogeneous primary tumors may
have more than one type of TIC. In such tumors, TICs
may be found in different fractions or may have similar
cell surface markers hence sorted in the same fraction. In
this case, the TIC-enriched signature would be a mixture
of 2 different types of TICs. This may reduce (or increase)
efficacy of a signature. One way to address this issue is to
inject single tumor cells into recipient mice and compare
multiple secondary tumors with their parental primary
tumor. We performed such analysis on MMTV-Her2/Neu
tumors, and found that independent secondary tumors
arising from injection of single cells within the TICenriched fraction were indistinguishable from primary
tumors [12]. These results indicate that MMTV-Her2/
Neu tumors have a single type of TIC, and therefore gene
expression profiles from enriched TIC fractions can be
used to predict the behavior of this BC subtype. Thus, a
prerequisite for generation of a TIC-derived signature is

TIC-derived prognostic signatures and TIC
biology
The forgoing discussion pertains to tumors driven
by a single type of TIC. Clonal and parallel evolution
among TICs may complicate generation of TIC-derived
prognostic signatures. First, there is evidence that TICs
with metastatic potential represent a subclass of TICs.
For example, in human pancreatic cancer, TICs express

patients with bad prognosis (red line, group 2). (B) A typical KM curve with signature-negative patients with good prognosis (group 1);

the demonstration that the specific tumor subtype has a
single type of TIC. Clearly, this prerequisite is difficult
to satisfy by single cell transplantation assays for most
human tumors, which show much reduced TIC frequency.
Together, we suggest that prognostic signatures based on
enriched TIC fractions are unlikely to be predictive for
cancers that exhibit high heterogeneity, clonal evolution
and multiple/distinct TICs. However, for many cancer
types with single type of TIC, this approach should yield
potent prognostic signatures.

stratify patients with similar KP curves seen in Figure 4A
because they identify as signature-negative the luminal-A
patients that have excellent prognosis. However, for other
BC subtypes, a typical KM survival curve identifies four
groups as shown in Figure 4B. Groups 1 and 2 behave
as in the idealized curve (Fig. 4A). Yet, group 2 includes
patients who succumb to the disease right off the bat and
those who die after several years. Tumors from the former
group of patients likely have already acquired oncogenic
mutations that drive aggressive dissemination/metastasis.
In contrast, the latter group may have not yet acquired
such mutations at the time of biopsy, but because their
tumors have a high number of TICs that self-renew, they
are more likely to acquire such mutations that facilitate
metastatic disease.
Group 1b represents patients that die despite
being signature-negative, whereas group 2b represents
patients who survive despite having signature-positive
tumors. Survival of group 2b is a welcome outcome;
it may reflect successful therapy or timely removal of
primary lesions through surgery before tumor cells have
disseminated. Group 1b is a major obstacle to clinical
use of prognostic signatures because death of signaturenegative patients suggests that the entire cohort should

Interpretation of signature-positive and signaturenegative Kaplan-Meier survival curves
Figure 4A depicts idealized and typical KaplanMeier (KM) survival curves of patients segregated on the
basis of a prognostic signature. In the idealized curve,
all signature-negative patients survive (black line),
whereas all signature-positive patients die (red line).
In such hypothetical curve, signature-negative patients
would clearly benefit from receiving minimal or no
treatment at all, while signature-positive patients should
be treated aggressively. For ERα+ BC, many signatures

box) and p values (by t-test).

be aggressively treated even if most patients in this group
would do well with minimal intervention. Thus, to justify
withholding aggressive drugs from signature-negative
patients, the signature should be predictive enough to
render group 1b a small minority. Group 1b may represent
a subset of patients that the signature fails to identify
as having a poor prognosis. Alternatively, these tumors
may be misdiagnosed (e.g. they are ERα+ or TNBC not
HER2+:ERα-). It is also possible that these tumors are
heterogeneous with some aggressive clones (signaturepositive) that were not included or were diluted out in the
biopsy from which RNA was extracted for microarray
profiling. Alternatively, the tumor may have evolved
to become more aggressive (signature-positive) post
biopsy. Thus, it is possible that group 1b is unavoidable.
The challenge is to generate prognosticators that can
separate signature-negative and -positive curves wide
enough so that risk of death for group 1b is out-weighted
relative to the risk of side effects from aggressive therapy
on signature-negative patients. Intriguingly, if HTICSpatients can be classified as a subgroup of HER2+:ERα- BC
(see next section), there is a possibility that other clinical
parameters or signatures could further separate group 1b
and help identify novel treatments for these patients.

If signature-negative and signature-positive tumors
represent distinct tumor subtypes, what makes them
different? With the advent of genome-wide analysis
of genetic and epigenetic alterations, this question can
now be directly addressed. At a more basic level, one
can calculate activity for multiple pathways to identify
features that distinguish signature-positive from -negative
tumors. We calculated pathway activity for 18 signaling
pathways as defined by [29], for 29 HER2+:ERα-:HTICS+
versus 24 HER2+:ERα-:HTICS- tumors. Strikingly, we
found that PI3K pathway activity was significantly
elevated in HTICS+ versus HTICS- tumors, whereas TNFα
and INFγ pathway activities were significantly reduced
(Fig. 5). This is in agreement with our HTICS signature
analysis where the up-regulated genes are involved in
cell proliferation and down-regulated genes are related to
immune response (Figure 1B). These results suggest that
HTICS+ and HTICS- HER2+:ERα- tumors are inherently
distinguishable, at least in part, by levels of PI3K,
TNFalpha and INFgamma signaling. Sequencing genes on
these pathways may identify mutations that activate these
pathways, separate HER2+:ERα- tumors into HTICS+ and
HTICS- subtypes, and underlie their differential prognosis.
PIK3CA is the second most frequently mutated
oncogene whereas the PI3K pathway is frequently
activated in BC [30]. Drugs targeting this pathway,
including PI3K, AKT, mTOR and autophagy inhibitors,
are in different phases of clinical trials and many new
drugs are being developed [31]. It was shown that
PI3K inhibitors are more effective against tumors with
Pik3ca mutations [32]. Our findings therefore suggest
that HER2+:ERα-:HTICS+ patients, with elevated
PI3K signaling, may be highly responsive to PI3K
pathway inhibitors in combination with anti-HER2 and
chemotherapy.

Are signature-negative and signature-positive
tumors close variants or different subtypes?
Elevated PI3K signaling and reduced TNFalpha and
INFgamma signaling in HTICS+ HER2+:ERα- patients
While we tend to view signature-negative and
signature-positive patients as close variants of the
same tumor subtype (e.g. HER2+:ERα-), they may
represent different cancer subtypes that conventional
immunohistochemistry with limited markers or microarray
profiling (e.g. PAM50) fail to distinguish. Indeed, HTICS
may classify seeming related tumors into two different
subtypes, e.g. HER2+:ERα-:HTICS+ and HER2+:ERα:HTICS-, which differ by TIC frequency, immune response,
etc. The question is, at what point can one classify tumors
as distinct subtypes rather than close variants? Alterations
in a single gene can determine response to therapy. For
examples, the response of HER2+ BC to trastuzumab is
strongly affected by phosphorylation /activity of SRC
[18], expression of the autophagy gene ATG12 [27] or cotreatment with metformin [28]. Therefore, highly related
tumors may be separated into 2 groups when response to
a single drug is considered. However, if tumors can be
classified into 2 groups based on clinical outcome even
without therapy, then, for all intent and purposes, these
groups may be viewed as distinct subtypes. Interestingly,
we showed that HER2+:ERα-:HTICS+ and HER2+:ERα:HTICS- patients have a different outcome even when
not treated with chemotherapy [12], and may therefore
represent distinct subtypes.

Rationale design of TIC-derived prognostic
signatures
When designing TIC-derived prognostic signatures,
one should consider the source of tumor samples, identify
TICs and address their stability, secure independent
cohorts with gene expression and clinical data, optimize
a signature on one cohort (training) and then validate on
multiple other (test) cohorts. Finally, the signature should
be adopted for use on clinical samples. Here we review
major steps in this process.
1. Tumor samples.
Ideally, a TIC-derived prognostic signature should
be derived from related primary tumors. However,
this is technically very difficult especially given the
heterogeneity of cancer. For example, HER2+:ERαtumors represent ~10% of BC samples. To obtain at least
5-10 independent HER2+:ERα- tumors - to identify TICs
and derive the signature - one needs fresh biopsies in
1324

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 1317-1328

sufficient quantities from at least 50 patients. Our success
in obtaining a good prognostic signature for human cancer
using a mouse model for HER2+:ERα- BC [33], suggests
that this approach may be applicable to other well-defined
cancer subtypes. Mouse models of cancer provide ample
supply of primary tumors and the ability to identify TICs
in an immune-proficient host. Excellent mouse models for
very specific breast cancer subtypes are being constantly
created (e.g. [34-38]) and they offer great opportunity to
generate subtype-specific signatures.
While prognostic signatures are typically derived
from primary tumors, it would be interesting to determine
whether metastatic lesions could prove a better source.
Intuitively, primary tumors should have the upper hand
because they harbor the genetic/epigenetic information
that determines TIC frequency and metastatic potential.
Moreover, the prognostic test will ultimately be
performed on primary tumor samples. Yet, given the
heterogeneity and parallel evolution of some cancers,
primary tumors may not be enriched for TICs that sustain
metastatic disease, as has recently been demonstrated in
Medulloblastoma [39]. Thus, TICs (or metastatic initiating
cells) from metastases may provide better prognostic
information than primary tumors.

be used to “train” the signature, and then at least 2-3
independent cohorts to assess its utility.
4. Bioinformatics.
To generate a prognostic signature, a training cohort
is used to first determine the clinical relevance of each
gene of interest. These genes can be identified through
statistical analysis such as ANOVA or SAM by comparing
expression in specific cell types (e.g. TIC-enriched vs.
non-TICs). Alternatively, all genes on the microarray are
used to correlate expression with clinical outcomes. A
simple “training” process assesses the association of each
individual gene with good or bad clinical outcome using
Pearson’s correlation or cluster analysis, choosing the
most predictive genes [12]. A more sophisticated approach
involves binary regression to identify a set of genes with
the highest ability to differentiate patients with good/bad
prognosis [11, 13]. The advantage of the latter method is
that it takes into account the effect of gene combination,
rather than individual genes in isolation, to predict
clinical outcome. In addition, cross-validation procedures
like leave-one-out can be used to test for robustness of
a signature. This is done by randomly selecting multiple
subsets from the training cohort to gauge signature
efficacy [13]. Ultimately, the effectiveness of a signature
has to be validated on multiple independent cohorts.  

2. Identification of TICs and their stability.
A prerequisite for generation of a TIC-derived
signature is the identification of cell surface markers
that can distinguish between TICs and non-TICs. In
mouse models of mammary adenocarcinomas, CD24
and CD49f, which are used to identify mammary stem
cells, are expressed on most tumor cells and cannot be
used to segregate TICs from non-TICs. For MMTV-Wnt1
tumors, CD24 and Thy1 were successfully used to identify
a small fraction of cells that is highly enriched for TICs
[40]. For MMTV-Her2/Neu, surface markers CD49f, Sca1, CD29, CD90, CD18 and CD14 failed to subdivide the
CD24+ cell population for enrichment of TICs [41, 42].
We found that JAG1 (and Notch1) could subdivide the
CD24 cell population into highly and moderately enriched
fractions [12]. The CD24+:JAG1- population contained
TICs at a frequency of 1-4.6%. As noted, TIC stability
should be determined by comparing multiple secondary
tumors derived from single cells to the primary tumors
from which they were derived using global gene profiling
methods.

5. Bringing prognostic signatures to the clinic.
Because microarray analysis requires large amount
of intact RNA, which can only be obtained from freshly
biopsied samples, it is not practical to perform this
analysis as a diagnostic tool in the clinic. Indeed, most
clinical samples are archived as Formalin-Fixed, ParaffinEmbedded (FFPE) tissues. NanoString technology, which
does not involve PCR amplification, allows for accurate
measurement of gene expression even from degraded RNA
samples including FFPE samples at pico molar levels [43].
This technology enables international multi-centered
testing with thousands of formalin-fixed specimens,
including old archived samples. One limitation of
NanoString technology is that unlike microarray analysis
in which genes of the entire transcriptome are measured,
only a few hundred genes can be monitored at the same
time. However, for short signatures such as Oncotype (21
genes) PAM50 (50 genes), NanoString technology has
already proved successfully [44], and can be applied to
other signatures such as HTICS.

3. Cohorts with microarray and clinical data.
Success in developing prognostic signatures very
much depends on availability of cohorts with clinical
and transcript expression data based on RNA extracted
from fresh tumor biopsies. For breast cancer, there are
relatively large cohorts that are publicly accessible. For
many other cancer types, this is a serious limitation. Even
for breast cancer, the available cohorts are old and from
patients given outdate treatment regimens. This problem
is confounded by the fact that one large cohort should

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
While much effort has been invested in RNA
expression-based technologies to generate sensitive
prognostic signatures, the advent of exome sequencing at
reduced cost (now approaching $1000/sample), opens the
door for exome-based prognosis or specific sequencing
of genes associated with a particular cancer. This may

soon revolutionize diagnosis and treatment at a patient/
tumor-specific gene resolution. Sequencing-based
prognosis alone may prove to be sufficiently powerful
to guide therapy. However, given the complexity of
gene regulation, splice form variants, genetic, epigenetic
and post-translational effects, we envision that ultimate
predictors would be based on complex analysis of several
parameters including gene expression and mutation
analysis. The applications of such next-generation
signatures with effective therapies will likely transform
personalized medicine, and dramatically reduce mortality
rates in years to come.
