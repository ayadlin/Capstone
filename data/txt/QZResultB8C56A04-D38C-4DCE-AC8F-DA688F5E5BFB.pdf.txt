of Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

Abstract
Glioblastoma is the most common form of primary brain tumor
in adults and is essentially incurable. Despite aggressive treatment
regimens centered on radiotherapy, tumor recurrence is inevitable
and is thought to be driven by glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC)
that are highly radioresistant. DNA damage response pathways are
key determinants of radiosensitivity but the extent to which these
overlapping and parallel signaling components contribute to GSC
radioresistance is unclear. Using a panel of primary patient-derived
glioblastoma cell lines, we conﬁrmed by clonogenic survival assays
that GSCs were signiﬁcantly more radioresistant than paired tumor
bulk populations. DNA damage response targets ATM, ATR, CHK1,
and PARP1 were upregulated in GSCs, and CHK1 was preferentially activated following irradiation. Consequently, GSCs exhibit
rapid G2–M cell-cycle checkpoint activation and enhanced DNA

repair. Inhibition of CHK1 or ATR successfully abrogated G2–M
checkpoint function, leading to increased mitotic catastrophe and a
modest increase in radiation sensitivity. Inhibition of ATM had
dual effects on cell-cycle checkpoint regulation and DNA repair that
were associated with greater radiosensitizing effects on GSCs than
inhibition of CHK1, ATR, or PARP alone. Combined inhibition of
PARP and ATR resulted in a profound radiosensitization of GSCs,
which was of greater magnitude than in bulk populations
and also exceeded the effect of ATM inhibition. These data demonstrate that multiple, parallel DNA damage signaling pathways
contribute to GSC radioresistance and that combined inhibition
of cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair targets provides the
most effective means to overcome radioresistance of GSC. Cancer

Introduction

varies on the basis of frequency and/or quantitative features
and underpins the evolution of resistant disease (6). Consistent
with this, GSCs that express stem cell markers such as CD133,
SSEA-1 (CD15), nestin, SOX2, and OLIG2 (7–10) are more
resistant to radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy than
more differentiated "tumor bulk" cells (10–14). There is an
urgent need to develop targeted treatment strategies that will
overcome the innate resistance of GSCs, improve local tumor
control, and extend patient survival.
Radiotherapy is a vital therapeutic modality for glioblastoma
that causes single- and double-stranded DNA breaks that evoke a
multifaceted DNA damage response (DDR). At the apex of the
DDR lie the serine/threonine protein kinases ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR),
which maintain genomic integrity by activating cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair pathways (15). ATM is mainly activated by
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), whereas ATR responds to
single-stranded regions of DNA generated at stalled replication
forks and during processing of DSBs by nucleases (16–19). The
MRN (MRE11–RAD50–NBS1) complex has key roles in sensing
and processing DSBs as well as activating ATM and ATR (20). ATR
activates cell-cycle checkpoint kinase proteins, including CHK1,
whereas ATM functions primarily through activation of CHK2.
These downstream checkpoint kinases activate G1 and G2–M cellcycle checkpoints through phosphorylation of phosphatases
CDC25A and CDC25C and kinases CDK1 and WEE1 that regulate
cell-cycle progression (21). In addition, ATM promotes repair of a
subset of DSBs. PARP facilitates repair of radiation-induced
single-strand breaks (SSB), and the radiosensitizing effects of
PARP inhibitors are well-characterized (22).

Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in
adults. Despite optimal treatment consisting of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant
temozolomide chemotherapy, median survival remains dismal
at 12 to 15 months (1). Treatment responses are inevitably
followed by relapse, typically within the maximally irradiated
volume (2, 3). In glioblastoma, tumorigenic cells display
complex clonal dynamics in which genetically distinct subclones have variable serial repopulating activity in vivo (4, 5).
This readout is likely to represent activity of self-renewing
glioblastoma "stem-like" cells (GSC) whose self-renewal ability

Radiosensitization of Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

There is growing evidence that DDR signaling is upregulated in
glioblastoma and integral to GSC radioresistance. Analysis of
glioblastoma clinical samples has revealed high levels of p-ATM,
p-CHK1, p-CHK2, and PARP1 compared with normal brain tissue
(23, 24). Furthermore, basal levels of p-CHK1, p-CHK2, and
RAD17 have been shown to be higher in CD133þ GSCs than in
nontumorigenic CD133 populations, a ﬁnding that was associated with radioresistance of the GSC population (10). However,
subsequent studies have either failed to show differences in DNA
repair capacity based on CD133 status or revealed increased
radiosensitivity of CD133þ GSCs compared with established
glioblastoma cell lines (25, 26). Such discrepancies may reﬂect
methodologic differences or comparisons between nonisogenic
cell lines. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that radioresistance of GSC populations is associated with enhanced ATMdependent DSB repair proﬁciency (27).
Currently, there is intense research into the development of
small-molecule inhibitors of DDR proteins (DDRi), one aim of
which is to increase the therapeutic index of standard treatments
(28). This is driven by several factors: (i) DNA is the major target
for many anticancer therapies, (ii) constitutive activation of DDR
is frequently observed in cancers (29), and (iii) activation of DDR
is associated with resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Several preclinical studies have successfully used DDRi to increase chemoand radiosensitivity in glioblastoma models, but these results
were not substantiated in the treatment-resistant GSC population
(30–34). More recently, we have shown the ATM inhibitor
KU55933 to be a potent radiosensitizer of GSC (27), and inhibition of PARP has also been shown to overcome radioresistance
of GSCs (35). These ﬁndings corroborate and extend the landmark
study by Bao and colleagues in which inhibition of CHK1 and
CHK2 was shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of GSCs (10).
The observation that GSCs exhibit upregulated DDR signaling
provides both opportunities and challenges. While targeting
individual DDR components can increase GSC radiosensitivity,
the relative impact on radioresistance of these and other components of the multiple DDR pathways remains unexplored. We
addressed this by using paired, primary, patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines cultured to enrich for or deplete the GSC population ("GSC" and "bulk" populations, respectively). We show
that GSCs express higher total and activated levels of DDR targets
than bulk populations and that this phenotype is maintained in
orthotopic xenograft models and glioblastoma patient specimens. Our mechanistic studies highlight rapid activation of
cell-cycle checkpoints and enhanced DNA repair as key determinants of GSC radioresistance. We show that although selective
inhibition of either pathway increases radiosensitivity of GSC,
effects are limited by reciprocity between these signaling conduits.
Accordingly, combined inhibition of ATR and PARP1 enhanced
the radiosensitivity of GSCs more profoundly than bulk populations. We propose that targeting of parallel DDR pathways is
required to maximize radiosensitization of GSCs and optimize
outcomes for patients with glioblastoma.

protocols described previously (22, 36) and in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Patient consent was sought before surgery, and tissue collection was approved by the local regional
Ethics Committee (LREC ref 04/Q0108/60) and compliant with
the UK Human Tissue Act 2004 (HTA Licence ref 12315). Cell
lines were validated in 2014 by expression of glioblastoma and
GSC markers and by their capacity to generate orthotopic tumors
in CD1 nude mice that recapitulate the key histopathologic
features of glioblastoma.
Generation of orthotopic tumors and immunohistochemistry
Tumors were generated by injecting 1  105 cells in CD1 nude
mice as described previously (37) and in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Drug treatment and radiation
ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (Tocris Bioscience), ATR inhibitor
VE821, PARP inhibitor olaparib, CHK1 inhibitors SCH900776
and CHIR-124 (Selleckchem), hydroxyurea and aphidicolin
(Sigma) were all dissolved in DMSO. For drug–radiation combination studies, cells were exposed to fresh media containing the
inhibitor or relative DMSO control for 1 hour prior to irradiation
(IR) in tissue culture vessels using an XStrahl RS225 cabinet at
room temperature with 195 kV/15 mA X rays producing a dose
rate of 1.6 Gray per minute. For UV studies, media containing the
drug were removed after 1 hour, and cells were irradiated using a
UV Stratalinker (Stratagene).
Clonogenic and neurosphere assays
Paired GSC and bulk population from E2 and G7 cell lines
formed countable colonies and were seeded at a density of 250
cells per well in Matrigel-coated 6-well dishes for 24 hours. Wells
were treated with the inhibitors or relative DMSO control for 1
hour followed by mock or 1 to 5 Gy IR. Cells were then incubated
for a further 24 hours followed by replacement with fresh media.
E2 and G7 colonies were ﬁxed after 2 or 3 weeks, respectively, in
methanol followed by staining with crystal violet. Colonies consisting of minimum 50 cells were counted manually and using
an automated colony counter (GelCount, Oxford Optronix).
Clonogenic survival data were ﬁtted using a linear quadratic
model, and SER0.37 and SF4 Gy values were calculated from the
ﬁtted curve. ANOVA test was used to analyze differences between
clonogenic survival curves.
Neurosphere assay was performed as described previously (27)
and in Supplementary materials and Methods.

Materials and Methods

Immunoﬂuorescence
Paired bulk and/or GSCs were plated on coverslips coated with
Matrigel and treated with radiation alone or in combination with
the inhibitors for 24 hours. Cells were ﬁxed and incubated with
g-H2AX or p-His H3 S10 antibodies overnight at 4 C followed by
incubation with secondary conjugated antibodies. g-H2AX foci
data are presented as box and whisker plots from 3 independent
experiments unless otherwise stated and analyzed using Mann–
Whitney U test as they were not normally distributed.

Derivation and maintenance of primary patient-derived
glioblastoma cell lines
Primary patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines E2, G7, R10,
R15, and R24 were derived in Cambridge, UK, from freshly
resected tumor specimens and maintained according to published

Flow cytometry and cell proliferation
For analysis of mitotic population, cells were treated and ﬁxed
with 70% ethanol and incubated with p-His H3 S10 antibody
followed by g-H2AX antibody and analyzed using ﬂow cytometry.

Combined Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) analysis was
carried out according to manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Analysis of GSC markers was carried out using conjugated CD133 and CD15 (Miltenyi Biotech). FACS was carried out
using FACSAria Fusion following labeling with CD133/CD15
phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies. Live cells were gated
and sorted populations were plated into 6-well plates in identical
stem cell culture media for 3 to 7 days before harvesting. Cell-cycle
distribution was determined following 40-minute incubation
with 10 mmol/L BrdUrd (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed
using FlowJo software (Tristar). Analysis of caspase-3/7 activity
was carried out using Caspase-Glo 3/7 kit (Promega).
Cell proliferation was measured in 96-well plates as described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Western blotting
For immunoblotting, whole-cell lysates were prepared and
processed in SDS buffer, blotted onto membranes, and probed
with primary antibodies (Supplementary Materials and Methods)
overnight followed by appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 to 3
hours. Bound antibodies were visualized using chemiluminescence and bands quantiﬁed using ImageJ.
Statistical analyses
All experiments were repeated three times unless otherwise stated
and data points reported as mean  SEM. Statistical analysis and
graphs were produced using Minitab 16 and GraphPad Prism 6.
Unpaired t test or one-sample t test were used to generate P values.

Results
GSC populations are radioresistant
We previously characterized two primary glioblastoma cell
lines (E2 and G7; refs, 27, 37). Using the same techniques, three
additional primary glioblastoma cell lines (R10, R15, and R24)
were expanded by culturing under selective media to enrich for or
deplete the GSC population. In immunodeﬁcient mice, GSCenriched populations of E2, G7 (27, 37), R10, and R15 cells
generated orthotopic tumors that recapitulated the human disease whereas GSC-depleted tumor bulk populations did not
(Supplementary Fig. S1). While the neural stem cell markers
nestin, SOX2, CD133, Olig2, and CD15 were heterogeneously
expressed across GSC cultures, expression of these markers was
consistently increased in GSCs compared with bulk populations
(Fig. 1A and B). Clonogenic survival assays in E2 and G7 cells
conﬁrmed GSC cultures to be more radioresistant than paired
bulk populations. Dose modifying factors calculated at 37%
survival (DMF0.37) showed that E2 and G7 GSCs were more
radioresistant than corresponding bulk populations by factors
of 1.36 (P ¼ 0.001) and 1.44 (P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1C–E).
Radioresistance of GSC populations was conﬁrmed by comparing
surviving fraction at 4 Gy (SF4 Gy, Supplementary Table S1). These
ﬁndings were consistent with the observation that GSCs were
refractory to cell death after high radiation doses (15 and 30 Gy) as
measured by Annexin V and PI staining (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2) and caspase-3/7 activity assays (Fig. 1G).
GSCs express high levels of DDR targets under basal conditions
and activate CHK1 rapidly following IR
DDR targets have previously been shown to be upregulated and
associated with GSC radioresistance (10, 27, 35). We explored this

4418 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

further in our GSC and bulk culture models and observed an
overall pattern of higher levels of total and phosphorylated CHK1
(S345) and ATR (S428) in GSCs compared with bulk populations
(Fig. 2A). Importantly, this was not an artifact of culture conditions, as CD133- or CD15-positive sorted cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated CHK1 than negative
sorted populations of E2, R24, and G7 cell lines cultured in the
same conditions (Fig. 2B). Higher levels of total CHK1 were also
observed in R24 and G7 cells expressing the relevant stem cell
marker.
We next explored whether differences in cell-cycle distribution
could account for the disparate CHK1 levels observed in GSC and
bulk populations, as CHK1 is typically expressed in S and G2
phases of proliferating cells. Analysis of BrdUrd incorporation
indeed revealed signiﬁcant differences in cell-cycle proﬁles (Fig.
2C and Supplementary Fig. S3) with GSCs exhibiting a marked
increase in the percentage of cells in S and G2 phases of the cell
cycle. Interestingly, the differences in cell-cycle distribution had
no signiﬁcant impact on cell doubling times, which were similar
in GSC and bulk populations in both E2 and G7 cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S3). While these results might explain the
observed increase in CHK1 levels in GSC, they also indicate that
enhanced radioresistance of GSCs is not a consequence of reduced
proliferation.
Further interrogation of DDR markers revealed higher levels of
PARP1 and phosphorylated ATM (p-ATM, S1981) in most GSC
populations (Fig. 2A). These ﬁndings were veriﬁed in vivo in our E2
and G7 GSC orthotopic xenograft models. Analysis of tumor
sections revealed heterogeneous staining for p-ATM (S1981) and
PARP1, highlighting differential protein expression between different cell populations (Fig. 2D). PARP1 staining in G7 tumors
was abundant and homogeneous, consistent with previous
reports proposing PARP1 as a glioblastoma marker (24). These
ﬁndings were reproduced in a clinical glioblastoma specimen,
which exhibited marked p-ATM and PARP1 expression in the
majority of tumor cells (Fig. 2D). These data illustrate collective
upregulation and/or activation of DDR targets in GSC populations under basal conditions in vitro and in a subpopulation of
glioblastoma cells in vivo.
We next sought to investigate how differences in basal CHK1
levels between GSC and bulk populations affect the DDR. Irradiation of E2 GSCs evoked more pronounced activation of CHK1
than in corresponding bulk populations as demonstrated by a
signiﬁcantly greater increase in the phospho-CHK1 S345:total
CHK1 ratio within 15 minutes that was maintained for at least 3
hours (Fig. 2E and F). Reduced CHK1 activation in E2 bulk cells
occurred despite similar levels of DNA damage induction
(g-H2AX). While the relative extent of radiation-induced CHK1
activation was similar in bulk and GSC populations of G7 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4), absolute levels of CHK1 and p-CHK1
were signiﬁcantly higher in G7 GSCs than in paired bulk cells both
under basal conditions and following IR. CHK2 activation (T68
phosphorylation) was similar in E2 GSC and bulk populations,
although differences were observed between G7 bulk and GSC
populations (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S4). We explored the
possibility that enhanced activation of CHK1 in GSC could be
caused by "priming" of the MRN DNA damage sensor complex
under basal conditions. No differences in total or phosphorylated
MRE11 and NBS1 between GSC and bulk populations were
observed under basal conditions or following IR, but modest
upregulation of RAD50 was observed in E2 and G7 GSCs

CHK1 activation was delayed (rather than reduced) in bulk cells
was excluded by demonstrating that S296 phosphorylation of
CHK1 was attenuated in E2 and absent in G7 bulk cells but
maintained in both GSC cultures at 6, 12, and 24 hours after IR
(Fig. 2G). While some variation in the kinetics of CHK1 activation
in GSCs was observed between different experiments, attributable
to the use of different batches of frozen primary patient-derived
cells, both phosphorylated and total CHK1 levels were consistently higher in GSCs than in bulk cells and were reproducibly
augmented at all time points following radiation. Finally,

enhanced activation of CHK1 (S345 and S296 phosphorylation)

pathways in glioblastoma (Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 38). However, analysis of the G2–M checkpoint by ﬂow cytometric quantiﬁcation of mitotic cells identiﬁed by S10 phosphorylation on
histone H3 (p-His H3) revealed that GSC activated G2 arrest
signiﬁcantly more efﬁciently than paired bulk populations,
requiring less time to reduce the mitotic cell population by
50% following IR treatment (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig.
S6). Consistent with this, E2 CD133þ sorted cells activated G2
arrest more rapidly and completely than CD133 cells cultured in
the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. S7). Intriguingly, E2
bulk cells failed to fully activate the G2–M checkpoint at any time
point (Fig. 3C). Dose–response studies revealed that depletion of
mitotic cell fraction by 75% occurred after signiﬁcantly lower
radiation doses in E2 and G7 GSC compared with bulk populations (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S6) and that E2 and G7 bulk

cells were released from the G2–M checkpoint earlier than GSC
(Fig. 3C). These results indicate that increased and/or more rapid
activation of CHK1 might be responsible for enhanced radioresistance of GSC and that the relative radiosensitivity of tumor
bulk cells (Fig. 1) might be, at least partly, explained by these cells
entering mitosis carrying unrepaired DNA damage (see also Fig. 6).
Radiosensitizing effects of CHK1 inhibition are more
pronounced in glioblastoma bulk cells than GSCs
Reasoning that radioresistance of GSCs might be driven by
enhanced CHK1-mediated activation of the G2–M checkpoint, we
hypothesized that inhibition of CHK1 would abrogate the G2–M
checkpoint and increase radiosensitivity. To investigate this, we used
SCH 900776 (SCH), a well-characterized CHK1-speciﬁc inhibitor,
which had no signiﬁcant effect on CHK2 activity as highlighted by

unaltered phosphorylation of T68 (Fig. 4A–C; refs. 39, 40). As expected, SCH treatment alone inhibited CHK1 S296 autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner and induced CHK1 S345
phosphorylation through CHK1-dependent inhibition of the PP2A
phosphatase feedback loop (Fig. 4A and C; Supplementary Fig. S8;
ref. 41). Treatment of E2 GSCs with SCH resulted in enhanced
induction of CHK1 S345 phosphorylation by UV or IR along with
increased g-H2AX levels reﬂecting increased DNA damaging signaling in response to CHK1 inhibition (Fig. 4A–C and Supplementary
Fig. S8). Induction of CHK2 T68 phosphorylation was also observed
following combined SCH/IR treatment, suggesting compensatory

addition, SCH treatment alone generated a g-H2AX signal highlighting a basal function of CHK1 in maintaining genomic stability (43).
Additional biomarkers of CHK1 inhibition included downregulation of phosphorylated WEE1 (S642) and CDC25C (T48), whereas
upregulation of CDC25A was observed following SCH treatment
alone and augmented in combination with radiation, consistent
with enhanced cell-cycle progression despite the presence of damaged DNA (Fig. 4B and C and Supplementary Fig. S8).
Because our earlier results showed that GSCs rapidly activate
the G2–M cell-cycle checkpoint in response to IR (Fig. 3), we

Radiosensitization of Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

CHIR-124 (Supplementary Fig. S9; ref. 44). While these data support
the assertion that CHK1 inhibition has therapeutic potential in
glioblastoma, the observation that overexpression and constitutive
activation of CHK1 in GSCs was not associated with increased
radiosensitization by CHK1 inhibitors indicates that additional
mechanisms could be responsible for limiting the radiosensitization
effects of CHK1 inhibition in the GSC population.

hypothesized that CHK1 inhibition would abolish this effect and
thus overcome the radioresistant GSC phenotype. Indeed, SCH
treatment abrogated radiation-induced G2 arrest in E2 and significantly attenuated it in G7 GSCs, whereas SCH treatment in the
absence of radiation was sufﬁcient to drive E2 and G7 GSCs into
mitosis (Fig. 4D). Clonogenic survival assays conﬁrmed signiﬁcant
radiosensitization of E2 and G7 GSC by CHK1 inhibition as
illustrated by sensitization enhancement ratios at 37% survival
(SER0.37) of 1.9 and signiﬁcant reductions in surviving fractions at
4 Gy (SF4 Gy) in both cell lines (Fig. 4E and F). Despite the limited
ability of bulk populations to phosphorylate CHK1 and induce G2
–M checkpoint activation in response to radiation, a similar or
greater magnitude of radiosensitization (SER0.37 ¼ 2.3–2.4) was
observed in bulk populations treated with SCH. This unexpected
observation was conﬁrmed using an alternative CHK1 inhibitor

combined SCH and IR treatment compared with individual
treatments alone (Fig. 5A and B). SCH treatment alone induced
a g-H2AX response, conﬁrming our earlier observations (Fig. 4A–
C). Because this signal was observed predominantly in S-phase
cells, we inferred that CHK1 inhibition exacerbates replication
stress in GSCs. Because SCH treatment also inhibited the G2–M
checkpoint (Fig. 4D), we investigated whether treated GSCs
would enter mitosis with damaged DNA. Indeed, following SCH
treatment, we observed a distinct population of mitotic cells
with high g-H2AX signal that was signiﬁcantly increased after
combined treatment with SCH and IR (Fig. 5C and D). Immunoﬂuorescent analysis conﬁrmed these results, demonstrating a
distinct mitotic cell population with intense, pan-nuclear g-H2AX
staining (middle row, Fig. 5E). This is likely to represent cells in
the initial stages of mitotic catastrophe, which was clearly visible
in a separate population of mitotic cells characterized by loss of
membrane integrity and fragmented morphology (bottom row).
Both populations were augmented in GSCs following combined

treatment with SCH and IR relative to either treatment alone. In
addition, we evaluated the consequence of mitotic division in
cells with damaged DNA and found a signiﬁcant increase in the
percentage of GSCs harboring one or more micronucleus following combined treatment (Fig. 5F). These data demonstrate that
CHK1 inhibition sensitizes GSC to IR by preventing G2–M checkpoint activation, allowing mitotic entry of cells bearing damaged
DNA, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and genomic instability.
Limited radiosensitization of GSCs by CHK1 inhibition is
explained by enhanced DNA repair
We next sought to identify the mechanism responsible for
limiting the radiosensitizing effects of CHK1 inhibition in GSCs
by comparing effects of IR plus SCH with those observed in paired
bulk cell populations in which SCH had shown more pronounced
radiosensitizing effects (Fig. 4E and F). Analysis of G7 cells
revealed a signiﬁcant increase in both total and mitosis-speciﬁc
g-H2AX–positive cells in the bulk population compared with

Radiosensitization of Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

GSCs following treatment with SCH alone or in combination with
radiation (Fig. 6A and B). Similarly, signiﬁcantly more mitotic
catastrophe events were observed in bulk populations than in
GSCs (Fig. 6C). Although E2 GSCs treated with SCH and IR
showed an increased total number of g-H2AX–positive cells
compared with the paired bulk cells, this did not translate into
increased mitotic damage or mitotic catastrophe (Supplementary
Fig. S10). Indeed, even when SCH and IR had increased the DNA
damage burden in E2 GSCs, the majority of these cells proceeded
to mitosis having repaired this damage, as indicated by a significant reduction in g-H2AX–positive mitotic cells and fewer cells
exhibiting mitotic catastrophe compared with the paired bulks
population (Supplementary Fig. S10). Thus, enhanced DNA
repair appears to compensate for the signiﬁcant increase in DNA
damage observed in GSCs treated with radiation and CHK1
inhibitor. Consistent with this, analysis of micronuclei, which
are formed as a direct consequence of mitotic division in cells with
unrepaired DNA DSBs, revealed that GSCs exhibit signiﬁcantly
enhanced DNA repair capacity when compared with bulk cells in
both E2 and G7 cell lines (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S10).
This theory is also corroborated by the observation that a significantly higher percentage of bulk cells than GSCs harbor micronuclei under basal conditions. To substantiate this hypothesis,
detailed analysis of DNA DSB repair was conducted by quantiﬁcation of g-H2AX foci in CENPF-positive (G2–M) and -negative
(G1) cells 24 hours after high dose radiation (10 Gy). This clearly
showed increased repair proﬁciency of GSCs compared with bulk
population (Fig. 6E and F), supporting our earlier hypothesis that
enhanced DNA repair is responsible for the attenuated radiosensitizing effects of CHK1 inhibition in E2 and G7 GSCs.
Optimum radiosensitization of GSCs through parallel
inhibition of DDR pathways
To identify the optimum targets for GSC radiosensitization, we
evaluated small-molecule inhibitors of additional DDR proteins
that were upregulated in GSCs (Fig. 2A). DNA repair was targeted
using the PARP inhibitor olaparib, cell-cycle checkpoints were
inhibited using the ATR inhibitor VE821, and combined targeting
of cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair was evaluated using the
ATM inhibitor KU55933. Results in E2 cells showed that ATR
inhibition sensitized GSC and bulk populations equally,
although there was a trend toward increased radiosensitization
of bulk cells (Fig. 7A and B). SER0.37 values for ATR and CHK1
inhibition were comparable. In contrast, inhibition of PARP or
ATM revealed a trend toward increased radiosensitization of
GSCs. The ATM inhibitor KU55933 proved to be the most potent
radiosensitizer of GSC (SER0.37 ¼ 2.60, Fig. 7B).
To understand the reasons for the different magnitudes of GSC
radiosensitization by the DDR inhibitors, we investigated their
effects on cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. Whereas inhibition of either ATR or CHK1 completely ablated radiationinduced G2–M checkpoint activation (Fig. 7C), inhibition of ATM
had only a partial effect. In contrast, ATM inhibition signiﬁcantly
impaired repair of radiation induced DSBs as demonstrated by a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of unresolved g-H2AX foci 24
hours post-IR (Fig. 7D). A similar effect on DNA repair was
observed following PARP inhibition. Considering that ATM inhibition was associated with the greatest radiosensitization of GSCs,
we hypothesized that dual inhibition of cell-cycle checkpoint
activation and DNA repair might provide optimum radiopotentiation. This was investigated by concomitant inhibition of DNA

repair and cell-cycle checkpoint function by combined treatment
with inhibitors of PARP and ATR. As predicted, the radiosensitizing effect of this combination in GSCs exceeded that of any of the
inhibitors individually (SER0.37 ¼ 3.20, Fig. 7E) and was significantly greater than that observed in the paired bulk cells. This is
likely to be due to increased unrepaired DSBs, as combined
inhibition of ATR and PARP was shown to be associated with a
signiﬁcant increase in g-H2AX foci in GSCs compared with the
bulk population (Supplementary Fig. S11). To support the clinical
relevance of this result, we performed neurosphere formation
assays using E2 GSCs and conﬁrmed that dual inhibition of ATR
and PARP achieved maximum potentiation of the inhibitory
effects of radiation on neurosphere formation (Fig. 7F). Taken
together, our results show that optimal radiosensitization of GSCs
is achieved through parallel inhibition of DDR pathways.

Discussion
Glioblastomas are heterogeneous tumors that are thought to be
dependent on a cellular hierarchy that includes a privileged GSC
subpopulation resistant to conventional therapy and capable of
tumor propagation. Uncertainty over the ideal model(s) in which
to study radiation responses of the GSC population may account
for the disparities in the existing published studies (10, 25, 26).
We generated paired cultures of primary, patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines (10, 35) in which the GSC population was
either enriched or depleted (27). While the use of sorted cell
populations on the basis of a speciﬁc stem cell marker such as
CD133 has been questioned because both CD133þ and CD133
cells have been capable of generating tumors in vivo (45), we used
this technique to validate observations made in our enriched
populations and to exclude the potential confounding effects of
different cell culture conditions. The GSC "signature" is likely to
be complex, modulated by the cellular microenvironment and
governed by multiple parameters, including epigenetic and genetic aberrations, that impact upon the expression of key regulatory
proteins. In keeping with this interpretation, a recent publication
highlights 4-core neurodevelopment transcription factors that are
crucial to GSC maintenance and tumorigenicity (46).
Our study shows that GSCs are more radioresistant than paired
bulk populations and exhibit higher expression of total and
activated DDR targets under basal conditions. The reason for this
is unclear; we speculate that it may reﬂect an endogenous response
of neural stem cells to DNA damage, which is subsequently
maintained as part of mutagenic selection and the malignant
phenotype. In addition, genetic differences between GSCs and
bulk cells may affect cellular biochemistry, possibly accounting
for lower proteasomal activity in GSCs contributing to higher
levels of DDR targets (47). More recently, increased levels of
reactive oxygen species have been proposed as a mechanism
responsible for upregulated PARP1 in GSCs (35).
One surprising observation was the apparent lack of CHK1
activation in bulk cells exposed to IR. This observation and the
slower DNA repair kinetics of these cells might explain why they
are signiﬁcantly more radiosensitive than the GSC population.
While our results support this, it should be emphasized that the
bulk cells remain relatively radioresistant, suggesting that alternative pathways might compensate for the lack of CHK1 activation and attenuated DDR. Indeed, noncanonical DDR pathways,
including NOTCH, TGFb, and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling,
have all been associated with glioblastoma radioresistance and

Radiosensitization of Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells

may be activated in these cells (reviewed in ref. 48). Alternatively,
bulk cells may rely on DNA damage tolerance (DDT) mechanisms,
which use translesion synthesis polymerases to bypass lesions for
repair at later time points (49). This provides a mechanism to
tolerate DNA damage allowing cells to continue replicating and
might explain survival of bulk cells following IR despite the lack of
checkpoint activation and early checkpoint release.
Our study shows that multiple DDR targets, including ATR,
ATM, CHK1, and PARP1, are upregulated in GSCs compared with
the bulk population and that some are also preferentially activated. Although some of these targets have overlapping functions,
individually they have distinct roles, which suggest that multiple
DDR pathways contribute to GSC radioresistance. We showed
that both GSC and bulk populations were radiosensitized by
CHK1 or ATR inhibition despite higher expression and activity of
these proteins in GSCs. This led us to propose that alternative
DDR pathways might mitigate the radiosensitizing effects of
CHK1 or ATR inhibition in the GSC populations. In support of
this explanation, inhibition of ATM, with its dual functions in
DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoint activation, yielded the most
potent single-agent radiosensitization of GSCs. We conﬁrmed this
hypothesis by demonstrating that combined inhibition of ATR
and PARP generated maximum radiosensitization and that this
effect was of signiﬁcantly greater magnitude in GSCs than in bulk
populations. Inhibition of PARP resulted in a signiﬁcant increase
in DNA DSBs, likely generated during S-phase from unrepaired
DNA SSBs. In the context of ATR inhibition, these cells were
unable to activate the G2–M cell-cycle checkpoint and thus
entered mitosis carrying high levels of unresolved DSBs. We
therefore propose that GSC radioresistance is driven by both
enhanced cell-cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair and
that optimal radiosensitization can only be achieved by dual
inhibition of both pathways.
Our data strongly support further preclinical evaluation of
ATR and PARP inhibitors in combination with IR as a potential
treatment for glioblastoma. This is an entirely novel approach
that to our knowledge has not been investigated in any cancer
models. Clearly, there will be concerns over the potential in vivo
toxicity of this combination treatment modality: ATR is essential
for tissue homeostasis, highlighted by embryonic lethality of
ATR-knockout mice, whereas PARP1 knockout is less deleterious. However, clinical experience with PARP inhibitors has been
extremely promising; it is tolerated well as a single agent and
clinical studies in combination with radiation are progressing.
To our knowledge, only one clinical study is currently recruiting
patients to explore ATR inhibition as a radiosensitizing strategy
in advanced solid tumors (www.clinicaltrials.gov). However, a
preclinical study using the ATR inhibitor VE822 has demon-

strated radiosensitization of pancreatic tumors in mice with no
apparent in vivo toxicity (50). The high proliferation indices of
most glioblastoma is predicted to render them more sensitive to
the combination of radiotherapy, PARP inhibition (33) and ATR
inhibition, and the GSC-speciﬁc radiosensitization mechanisms
outlined in this article are associated exclusively with S, G2, and
M phases of the cell cycle. Because normal brain tissues are
composed almost entirely of nonreplicating, postmitotic cells
with intact G1–S checkpoint and DNA repair pathways, we
predict that the radiosensitizing effects of the proposed combination will be exerted exclusively upon glioblastoma tumor cells
and will have particular impact on the radioresistant GSC
population.
In summary, our study provides the ﬁrst detailed examination
of DDR responses in GSCs and has important implications for the
management of glioblastoma. Our results support the notion that
GSCs are profoundly radioresistant and identify a novel drug
combination strategy targeting both cell-cycle checkpoint and
DNA repair functions that has potential to overcome this. Future
studies will focus on in vivo characterization of this strategy
and will identify optimal radiation–drug combination scheduling
to take forward to phase I clinical trials in patients with
glioblastoma.
