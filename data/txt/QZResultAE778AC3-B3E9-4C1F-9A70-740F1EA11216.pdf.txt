BACKGROUND: The current study investigated the prevalence and prognostic value of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in
patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from an area in southern China in which HBV and NPC are endemic. METHODS: A
total of 1301 patients with nonmetastatic, histologically proven NPC who were treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were
retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In this series, 142 of the 1301 patients (10.9%) had chronic HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] seropositive). The percentages of non-cancer-related deaths (15.0% vs 12.1%; P 5.618) and severe hepatic adverse events
(3.5% vs 0.9%; P 5.145) were similar among patients with NPC with and without HBV infection. The 5-year overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival (PFS), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rates for patients with NPC with or without HBV
infection were 70.9% and 80.8% (P 5.003), 63.7% and 73.0% (P 5.016), and 81.7% and 88.2% (P 5.035), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified chronic HBV infection in patients with NPC as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (hazards ratio
[HR], 1.684; P 5.003), PFS (HR, 1.451; P 5.015), and LRFS (HR, 1.573; P 5.048). Further analysis revealed that chronic HBV infection
was an unfavorable, independent prognostic factor in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC, but not those with early-stage disease. In patients with stage III=IV NPC, HBsAg-positive patients had poorer OS (64.0% vs 77.2%; P 5.003), PFS (56.2% vs 70.6%;
P 5.004), and LRFS (76.2% vs 88.3%; P 5.002) compared with HBsAg-negative patients. On multivariate analysis, chronic HBV infection was found to be an independent adverse prognostic predictor for OS (HR, 1.734; P 5.004), PFS (HR, 1.644; P 5.003), and LRFS
(HR, 2.108; P 5.003) in patients with stage III=IV NPC. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic HBV infection is an independent adverse prognostic

INTRODUCTION
The highest incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) reportedly occurs in southern China, with the yearly incidence
rate varying between 15 and 50 cases per 100,000 population.1 Radiotherapy (RT) is the primary treatment modality for
all patients with locally and regionally confined stages of NPC. As in most solid tumors, the TNM staging system is currently the most reliable method for determining clinical treatment strategies and predicting treatment outcome. However,
according to recent studies, the TNM staging system is not satisfactorily accurate in terms of risk segregation and survival
prediction.2 Thus, the identification of new prognostic factors is of great importance in improving outcome prediction
and tailoring individualized treatment in patients with NPC.
Southern China has one of the highest incidences of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, with hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity rates of between 10% to 12% in the general population.3 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that chronic HBV infection may be an important comorbidity in patients with NPC in southern China.
Chronic HBV infection represents a serious public health problem worldwide, and is a major cause of chronic hepatitis,
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.4 Recently, HBV has been associated with hematopoietic cancers, including lymphoma and leukemia,5,6 and pancreatic cancer.7 In addition, HBV-infected patients with cancers such as diffuse large

Chronic HBV Infection in NPC/Liu et al

B-cell lymphoma8 or multiple myeloma9 have distinct
clinical characteristics and=or outcomes compared with
uninfected patients.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to
date has investigated the characteristics and outcomes of
patients with NPC and chronic HBV infection. Given
that both NPC and HBV are endemic in southern China,
the objective of the current study was to gain insight into
the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in patients with
NPC, and evaluate the impact of chronic HBV infection
on the clinical features and survival outcomes of NPC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

A retrospective review was conducted on the case records
of patients with NPC treated at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, People’s Republic of
China) between February 2003 and January 2007. A
total of 1403 newly diagnosed patients with nonmetastatic and histologically proven NPC were identified. Of
these, 112 cases were excluded due to a lack of substantial
information or hepatitis viral infections other than HBV;
the remaining 1301 cases were included in the current
study. This retrospective study was conducted in compliance with the institutional policy to protect the patients’
private information and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer
Center. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Clinical Staging

All patients included in the current study had undergone
routine pretreatment evaluations including a complete
medical history, physical examinations, and hematology
and biochemistry profiles, as well as magnetic resonance
imaging of the neck and nasopharynx, chest radiography,
abdominal sonography, and whole-body bone scans
using single-photon emission computed tomography.
Furthermore, positron emission tomography-computed
tomography was performed on 123 of 1301 patients
(9.5%). All patients were restaged according to the seventh edition of the Union for International Cancer Control=American Joint Committee on Cancer staging
system for NPC.10 All magnetic resonance imaging and
clinical records were reviewed separately by 2 radiologists
(L.Z.L. and L.T.) to minimize heterogeneity in restaging;
disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Virological and Liver Function Studies

Because HBV is endemic in southern China, all
patients treated at the study institution were screened for

serological HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis
B e antigen, hepatitis B e antibody, and hepatitis B core
antibody using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays
at the time of diagnosis. In addition, all patients were also
tested for serum human immunodeficiency virus antibody, hepatitis A virus antibody, hepatitis C virus antibody, hepatitis D virus antigen, hepatitis D virus
antibody, and hepatitis E virus antibody. However, the
HBV viral loads were not routinely determined. Chronic
HBV infection was defined as HBsAg seropositivity.
In our department, patients who underwent chemotherapy underwent routine liver function tests including
analysis of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels every 2 weeks during
treatment, as well as at every follow-up visit. The severity
of hepatic dysfunction and adverse events were defined
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0). Disruption of chemotherapy was defined as either a premature termination of
chemotherapy or a delay of > 8 days between chemotherapy cycles.11
Treatment

All patients were treated with definitive-intent RT. The
majority of the patients (761 of 1301; 58.5%) were
treated with 2-dimensional conventional RT, whereas
38.9% of patients (506 of 1301) received intensitymodulated RT and the remaining 2.6% (34 of 1301)
were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT. Details
of the RT techniques used at the Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center have been described previously.12-15
Overall, 504 of 1301 patients (38.7%) were treated
with RT only, and 797 of 1301 patients (61.3%) received
neoadjuvant, concomitant, or adjuvant chemotherapy.
The majority of the patients (640 of 872; 73.4%) with
stage III or IV NPC (classified as T3-T4 and=or N2-N3
disease) received chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given when the waiting time was considered to be
longer than acceptable or when it was considered advantageous to downsize bulky tumors. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin with 5fluorouracil or cisplatin with taxane administered every 3
weeks for 2 or 3 cycles. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin given on weeks 1, 4, and 7 of RT or
weekly cisplatin. The regimens and dosages were not
altered according to the serum HBsAg status. Seventy-six
patients in the HBsAg-positive group (53.5%) and 570
patients in the HBsAg-negative group (49.2%) received
concomitant

or a combination of the 2 was delivered to 20 (14.1%)
patients and 131 patients (11.3%) in the HBsAg-positive
and HBsAg-negative groups, respectively.
Prophylactic antiviral therapy was not routinely
administered. When possible, salvage treatments (including afterloading, surgery, and chemotherapy) were provided in the event of documented disease recurrence, or if
the disease persisted.
Patient Follow-Up and Statistical Analysis

Patients returned for follow-up appointments at least
every 3 months during the first 2 years, and then every 6
months thereafter until death. The follow-up duration
was calculated from the first day of therapy to the day of
death, or to the last examination. The median follow-up
time was 55.0 months (range, 2.7 months-119.5 months)
for the HBsAg-positive group and 58.2 months (range,
2.8 months-121.2 months) for the HBsAg-negative
group. The following endpoints were assessed: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional
recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS). We calculated OS from the first
day of treatment to death, and PFS was calculated from
the first day of treatment to the date of disease progression
or death from any cause. For LRFS and DMFS analyses,
we recorded the latencies (ie, time from the first day of
treatment) to the first locoregional failure or remote failure, respectively.
SPSS (version 16.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) was used
for all statistical analyses. We compared the categorical
variables in different groups using the chi-square test or
Fisher exact test if indicated. Actuarial rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences
were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model was used to
test for independent significance by backward elimination
of insignificant explanatory variables. Covariates including host factors (ie, age and gender), tumor factors (ie, T
and N classification), RT (ie, RT techniques), and chemotherapeutic intervention (ie, RT alone or chemo-RT)
were included in all tests. The criterion for statistical significance was set at an a of .05 and all P values were based
on 2-sided tests.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of the Patients

In total, 142 of the 1301 patients (10.9%) were seropositive for HBsAg. HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative
patients were similar in terms of the majority of host
factors, histological categories, and tumor factors. In

addition, there were no significant differences with regard
to the RT techniques or the use of chemotherapy noted
between the groups. However, the HBsAg-positive group
had a higher percentage of younger patients (ie, those
aged < 50 years) compared with the HBsAg-negative
group (76.1% vs 65.5%; P < .012) (Table 1). Liver function data were available for 1034 of the patients at baseline

patients compared with those who were HBsAg negative
(42.6% vs 18.6%; P < .001) (Table 1).

Patterns of Treatment Failure and Causes of
Death

The patterns of treatment failure and causes of death are
summarized in Table 2. Up to the last day of follow-up,
23 of 142 patients in the HBsAg-positive group (16.2%)
and 127 of 1159 patients in the HBsAg-negative group
(11.0%) experienced locoregional failure, and 30 of 142
patients in the HBsAg-positive group (21.1%) and 181 of
1159 patients in the HBsAg-negative group (15.6%)
developed distant metastases. Moreover, 40 of 142
patients in the HBsAg-positive group (28.2%) and 214 of
1159 patients in the HBsAg-negative group (18.5%)
died; the majority of deaths (85% and 87.9%, respectively) were attributed to NPC. There was no significant
difference noted with regard to the percentage of noncancer-related deaths between HBsAg-positive and
HBsAg-negative patients (15.0% vs 12.1%; P 5 .618)
(Table 2).
Hepatic Adverse Events

Data regarding hepatic adverse events were available for
630 of the 797 patients who received chemotherapy
(79.0%). We compared the incidence of hepatic adverse
events in HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative patients.
Hepatic adverse events were found to be more common
among those who were HBsAg positive (44.2% vs 19.2%;
P < .001). However, the incidence of severe hepatic
adverse events (grade 3) was similar between groups
(3.5% vs 0.9%; P 5 .145); no grade 4 hepatic adverse
events or deaths related to liver failure were reported to

have occurred. Among the 96 HBsAg-positive patients
who received chemotherapy, 4 (4.2%) experienced disruption of chemotherapy due to hepatic adverse events;
these patients received hepatica (diammonium glycyrrhizinate, glycyrrhizin, reduced glutathione, or polyene
phosphatidylcholine) with or without lamivudine. After
the patients’ hepatic function recovered, they all completed the planned chemotherapy. No patients in the
HBsAg-negative group experienced disruption of chemotherapy due to hepatic adverse events.
Prognostic Value of Chronic HBV Infection in
Patients With NPC

The 5-year OS rate (70.9% vs 80.8%; P 5 .003) (Fig.
1A), PFS rate (63.7% vs 73.0%; P 5 .016) (Fig. 1B), and
LRFS rate (81.7% vs 88.2%; P 5 .035) (Fig. 1C) for
HBsAg-positive patients were significantly lower than the
corresponding rates for HBsAg-negative patients with
NPC; the difference in the DMFS rates between HBsAgpositive and HBsAg-negative patients with NPC nearly
reached statistical significance (77.3% vs 84.0%;
P 5 .062) (Fig. 1D). Overall, on univariate analysis,
patients with NPC who were HBsAg positive had a significantly poorer prognosis in terms of OS, PFS, and LRFS
compared with HBsAg-negative patients.
Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for
various prognostic factors. Consistent with the results of
the univariate analysis, HBsAg seropositivity was found to
be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS
(hazards ratio [HR], 1.684; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 1.198-2.366 [P 5 .003]), PFS (HR, 1.451;
95% CI, 1.076-1.955 [P 5 .015]), and LRFS (HR,
1.573; 95% CI, 1.005-2.463 [P 5 .048]) (Table 3).
HBsAg-positive patients with NPC also had an increased
risk of distant metastasis compared with HBsAg-negative
patients; this difference was marginally statistically significant (HR, 1.471; 95% CI, 0.999-2.167 [P 5 .051])
(Table 3). Both advanced T classification and advanced N
classification were associated with an increased risk of
death, disease progression, and distant metastasis in the
entire cohort (Table 3).

P 5 .418) (Fig. 2E), and DMFS (84.6% vs 88.6%;
P 5 .617) were comparable between patients who were
HBsAg positive and those who were HBsAg negative.
Among patients with stage III=IV NPC, HBsAg-positive
patients had poorer OS (64.0% vs 77.2%; P 5 .003) (Fig.

LRFS (76.2% vs 88.3%; P 5 .002) (Fig. 2E) rates, and
trended toward inferior DMFS rates (74.2% vs 81.7%;
P 5 .065) compared with HBsAg-negative patients. On
multivariate analysis, chronic HBV infection was found
to be an independent prognostic factor for poorer OS
(HR, 1.734; 95% CI, 1.195-2.517 [P 5 .004]), PFS
(HR, 1.644; 95% CI, 1.180-2.291 [P 5 .003]), and
LRFS (HR, 2.108; 95% CI, 1.288-3.449 [P 5 .003])
(Table 4) in patients with stage III=IV NPC; the effect of
chronic HBV infection on DMFS was found to be marginally significant (HR, 1.530; 95% CI, 0.989-2.366
[P 5 .056]) (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
According to previous studies, the prognosis of patients
with NPC is far from clearly defined.2 To our knowledge,
the current study is the first large-scale study to determine
the impact of chronic HBV infection on the prognosis of
patients with nonmetastatic NPC from a population with
a high prevalence of both HBV infection and NPC. The
HBsAg seropositivity rate in our cohort of patients with
NPC was 10.9%, which was similar to that of the general
population in this area.3 Moreover, patients with NPC
and chronic HBV infection tended to be younger than
patients without HBV infection. Previous studies regarding the association between HBV infection and malignant
diseases have mainly focused on HBV reactivation, a complication that can be induced by immunosuppressive
therapies.16 However, to the best of our knowledge, few
studies to date have investigated the influence of chronic
HBV infection on the prognosis of patients with cancer,

especially those with nonhematological malignancies. The
current study is the first to our knowledge to provide evidence that chronic HBV infection represents a significant,
unfavorable prognostic factor in patients with nonmetastatic locoregionally advanced NPC.
The extent of hepatic injury noted during chemotherapy in the current study was mild, which is consistent
with our previously published clinical trial in which no
grade 3-4 hepatic adverse events occurred.17 However,
HBV reactivation and the associated liver failure are crucial complications in HBV-infected patients with cancer
who are receiving chemotherapy.16,18 Compared with
uninfected patients, Yeo et al reported a significantly
higher incidence of severe hepatitis in HBV-infected
patients with NPC who underwent chemotherapy without antiviral prophylaxis, including 1 death that was attributable to HBV reactivation.11 However, in the current
study cohort, the incidence of severe hepatitis during
chemotherapy did not differ significantly between
HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative patients, with only
3.5% of patients developing hepatitis of grade 3 or higher
and no HBV reactivation-related deaths being reported.
This inconsistency might be due to some obvious

differences between the patients included in the study by
Yeo et al11 and the current study. Only patients with nonmetastatic disease who were treatment-naive were eligible
for the current study. However, compared with the current study, nearly one-half of the patients (9 of 21
patients) included in the study by Yeo et al11 received salvage chemotherapy, which may include more intensive
chemotherapy regimens and increased cycles of chemotherapy. Also, patients with recurrent or metastatic disease
who receive salvage chemotherapy are believed to have a
poorer tolerance to cytotoxic agents, and 2 patients in the
study by Yeo et al had preexisting liver metastases.11 However, given the retrospective nature of these studies, hepatic injury in HBV-infected patients with NPC
undergoing chemotherapy still needs further study.
In the current study, HBV reactivation and the
related liver failure were not found to be significant complications in HBsAg-positive patients with NPC who
were receiving chemotherapy. The HBsAg-positive
patients in the current study did not receive prophylactic
antiviral agents, because such prophylaxis was not highly
recommended in the guidelines at the time the treatment
was administered. This makes HBV reactivation the first
suspected cause of the poorer survival outcomes observed
in HBsAg-positive patients with NPC. According to previous studies, HBV reactivation can occur in patients with
cancer, particularly those with hematological malignancies, who are receiving treatment with corticosteroids,
anthracycline, or rituximab.16 However, these risk factors
for HBV reactivation do not apply to patients with NPC.
Moreover, there was no significant difference noted
regarding the incidence of non-cancer-related deaths
between the HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative
patients with NPC. These results suggest that HBV reactivation was not the primary factor responsible for the
poorer survival outcomes observed in HBsAg-positive
patients with NPC. Consequently, it is reasonable to speculate that chronic HBV infection negatively affects the
survival of patients with locoregionally advanced NPC via
a mechanism other than HBV reactivation.
The latent mechanism leading to the unfavorable
prognosis in HBV-infected patients with NPC may be
linked to certain types of immunological dysfunction.
HBV is associated with immune dysfunction, as demonstrated by hepatitis B-related nephritis19 and its association with lymphoma.8 Overexpression of the
immunosuppressive protein programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on total CD8-positive T cells20 and the
lower proliferative capability of activated B cells21 indicate
the existence of immune system dysfunction in patients

patients with NPC who are receiving chemotherapy is
unnecessary due to the retrospective nature of the current
study and the finding that HBV DNA fluctuations were
not monitored. The guidelines for the management of
chronic HBV infection published by the European Association for the Study of the Liver, which were updated in
2009, strongly recommend that all HBsAg-positive
patients who are candidates for chemotherapy should
receive antiviral prophylaxis, regardless of their HBV
DNA load.4 Moreover, the influence of antiviral prophylaxis on the survival of HBV-infected patients with NPC
is of great interest and warrants further research.
Conclusions

In the current study, chronic HBV infection was found to
be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in
patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. Further prospective studies of large cohorts of patients with NPC that
include an analysis of HBV DNA load are warranted to
confirm these results. In addition, the latent mechanism
by which chronic HBV infection leads to poorer survival
outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC
needs to be investigated.
FUNDING SUPPORT

receive chemotherapy, which would add additional insult
to the already injured immune system. Thus, a subtle
interplay may exist between the influence of chronic HBV
infection and NPC cells on the immune system, which
may negatively affect host immunological monitoring of
malignant cells in patients with locoregionally advanced
NPC. However, this hypothesis needs to be addressed in
future studies. In addition, the potential value of immunotherapeutic strategies in HBV-infected patients with
locoregionally advanced NPC needs to be explored.24
The results of the current study provide what to our
knowledge is the first evidence of the poor prognostic
impact of chronic HBV infection on the prognosis of
patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. Therefore,
researchers conducting clinical trials in patients with NPC
should pay attention to the HBsAg seropositivity rates in
different treatment arms, especially in regions of endemic
chronic HBV infection. However, because of a lack of
data regarding HBV DNA load, which is a major drawback of the current study, it remains unknown whether
patients with NPC who displayed higher HBV replication
rates had poorer survival outcomes. Conversely, although
hepatic adverse events noted in the current study were
mild and no HBV-related liver failure was documented,
we cannot conclude that prophylactic antiviral therapy for
