Patterns of Psychiatric Medication Use Among Nationally
Representative Long-Term Cancer Survivors and Controls
Ilana M. Braun, MD1; Sowmya R. Rao, PhD2,3; Fremonta L. Meyer, MD1; and Giuseppe Fedele, MD1,4

BACKGROUND: Investigations of long-term cancer survivors (LTCS) indicate that this population is not appreciably different from
cancer-naive peers with respect to several neuropsychiatric domains. The current study sought to determine whether differences in
psychiatric medication use might help to explain the negative findings. METHODS: In a nationally representative sample, 5692 subjects were queried for cancer history, psychiatric diagnoses, and psychotropic medication use. The LTCS were defined as those individuals who were 5 years from diagnosis and whose cancer was in remission or cured. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
were obtained from multivariable logistic regression models evaluating the relationship between cancer status and use of psychiatric
medications. The interaction between case/control status and psychiatric diagnoses was also tested in a logistic regression model to
predict psychotropic medication use. RESULTS: A total of 225 participants met the criteria for LTCS and 3953 met the criteria for
cancer-naive controls (CNC). The LTCS were no more likely than CNC to carry a psychiatric diagnosis. Despite the LTCS reporting
somewhat greater psychotropic medication use compared with the CNC (28.8% vs 22.3%), unadjusted and adjusted differences did
not reach statistical significance, possibly due to sample size. The interaction between case/control status and carrying a psychiatric
diagnosis was not found to be significantly associated with receiving a psychiatric medication. CONCLUSIONS: LTCS and CNC demonstrated comparable rates of psychiatric prescription medication use. The relationship between taking a psychiatric medication and
carrying a psychiatric diagnosis was not found to be significantly different between the case and control groups. These findings contribute to an emerging hypothesis that in general LTCS are not a particularly psychiatrically vulnerable group. Cancer 2015;121:132-8.

INTRODUCTION
Advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment have contributed to a sharp increase in the number of individuals surviving
cancer. Between 1971 and 2007, cancer survivors, defined as individuals living with a history of cancer, increased from
1.5% to 3.9% of the US population.1 In 2012, approximately 64% of US cancer survivors had been diagnosed with cancer
within the previous 5 years, and 15% within the previous 20 years.2 Expansion of the cancer survivor population has justifiably prompted inquiries into whether survivors carry a distinct symptom burden that invites tailored medical or mental
health care. In fact, in a previous publication, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although not specifically
addressing mental health issues, called for the implementation of “evidence-based cancer plans that include all stages of
cancer survivorship.”3
In general, cancer survivors require mental health treatment at higher rates than cancer-naive controls (CNC).4-6
Although this appears to be the case for cancer survivors in general, investigations of long-term cancer survivors (LTCS),
strictly defined as individuals surviving >5 years after diagnosis with cancer in remission or cured, indicate that this subpopulation is not appreciably different from their cancer-naive peers with respect to several neuropsychiatric domains. When
compared with controls in large nationally representative databases, cancer survivors who are 4 years from diagnosis do
not appear to demonstrate increased rates of current major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder, panic disorder, or cognitive symptoms.7-10 In the single instance in which a positive association was found,
the results were potentially confounded by the inclusion of LTCS who were still undergoing active cancer treatment, as

well as a reliance on broadly defined psychological distress, a term that does not necessarily map onto psychiatric
diagnoses.11
This body of findings raises a fundamental question
that to the best of our knowledge remains unexplored:
namely, whether LTCS take more psychotropic medications, thereby contributing to the explanation for the absence of increased rates of psychiatric symptoms noted in
this population. Evidence suggests that a substantial percentage of patients with cancer who are in active treatment
receive psychotropic drugs. A large case-control study
based on insurance data in the Netherlands demonstrated
that patients with cancer are significantly more likely than
CNC to receive prescriptions for psychiatric medications.12 Another study determined that >50% of a waiting room sample of patients with breast cancer had been
prescribed either an antidepressant or anxiolytic.13 Plausibly, some patients with cancer might continue to receive
psychiatric medications after the completion of active cancer treatment, or remain better connected than their
cancer-naive peers to systems of providers that might prescribe them.
The National Comorbidity Study Replication
(NCS-R) provides a rare opportunity to probe this question. In the study, a total of 9282 individuals in a probability sample (weighted to approximate the 2000 US
census) were interviewed regarding psychiatric disorders,
treatments, and risk factors. A subset of 5692 participants
was also queried about cancer status and history. The current study harnesses these rich data to compare LTCS and
CNC with regard to use of psychiatric medications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
National Comorbidity Study Replication

The NCS-R is a psychiatric, cross-sectional, cluster area
probability study conducted by trained lay interviewers in
the contiguous United States. Complete methodological
information is available elsewhere.14 Investigators identified potential participants through a multistage sampling
process that consisted of probability samples, first of
counties or metropolitan areas, then units of 50 to 100
households, and then a single household. Once a household was identified, researchers selected a potential participant randomly from among English-speaking individuals
aged 18 years. Residents of military bases, nursing
homes, and chronic care facilities were excluded. The
overall participation rate was 74.6%.
All NSC-R participants (n 5 9282) received part 1
of the survey, which covered lifetime psychiatric disorders
Cancer

and demographic data; a subset of participants
(n 5 5692) also received part 2. By design, this subset
oversampled those with psychopathology and included all
participants with a lifetime psychiatric disorder, 59% of
those who were below the threshold for a psychiatric disorder or who reported ever having received mental health
services, and 25% of those who neither met the criteria for
a lifetime psychiatric disorder nor reported ever having
received mental health services. Part 2 of the survey collected data regarding risk factors, additional psychiatric
diagnoses, and medical comorbidities. The final data were
weighted to adjust for differential probabilities in selection, nonresponse rates, and poststratification differences
in demographic variables. For these analyses, we used the
public access NCS-R database.15
Sample

Participants who indicated that they had a history of cancer were queried regarding the type of cancer, date of diagnosis, and current status (“in treatment,” “cured,” “in
remission,” or “don’t know”). In the current analyses, we
considered an LTCS to be someone who reported having
been diagnosed with cancer after the age of 18 years
(because of the effects cancer might have on psychological
maturation) and who at time of the interview was either
cured or in remission and at least 5 years from diagnosis.
The CNC group consisted of individuals who denied cancer histories.
Medications

In addition to the number of prescription and nonprescription medications (psychiatric or otherwise) a subject had
used in the 7 days before the interview, the investigators
gathered detailed information regarding psychotropic medication use under the supervision of a physician within the
year before the interview. Interviewers provided subjects
with a list of 215 psychotropic drugs, both brand name and
generic, and were instructed both to continue probing until
all drugs were mentioned and to consult medication bottles
for names when participants encountered memory lapses
(discussions were held in a respondent’s home).14 These
medications were categorized in the original NCS-R database under the following umbrella headings:
“antidepressants,” “sleeping pills/sedatives” (ie, nonbenzodiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor agonists), “tranquilizers”
(ie, benzodiazepines), “amphetamines/stimulants,” and
“antipsychotics.” Because chronic pain is a common report
among LTCS, we added an umbrella term of “psychotropic
drugs with possible pain indications.” These medications
occasionally are used, either on-label or off-label, to manage
133

Original Article

neuropathic pain and include tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, gabapentin, and venlafaxine (duloxetine
was not in widespread use when the NCS-R was administered). For each psychotropic medication, subjects were
asked to identify the reason for taking it and the prescriber
(“psychiatrist,” “general or family physician,” “some other
physician,” “some other health professional,” and “no one
prescribed the medication”). The latter 4 categories were
combined as “other” in the current analyses.
Covariates
Demographics

Age, sex, marital status (married/cohabiting, divorced/
separated/widowed, or never married), race (white, black,
Hispanic, or other), education (<12 years, high school
graduate, some college, or college graduate), and household income are among the demographics collected by
the NCS-R and adjusted for in the study’s regression
analyses.
Psychiatric Variables

The NCS-R relied on the World Health Organization’s
World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview hierarchical algorithm to determine psychiatric diagnoses based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria. A psychiatric diagnosis was established only if the participant
met the criteria in the year before the interview.
Medical Variables

Two physical health variables were evaluated: a subjective
health status rating (“excellent,” “very good,” “good,” “fair,”
or “poor”) and a yes/no response to whether a subject had
been limited within the last 3 months as a result of health
problems. In the regression analyses, we grouped subjects
into those with fair or poor health status and those with
good, very good, or excellent health status. If a subject indicated that she or he was limited within the past 3 months,
she or he was included in the fair/poor status group, regardless of how she or he responded to the initial query. Similarly, a conglomerate chronic pain variable was constructed
based on yes/no responses to the questions of whether the
subjects ever had: 1) arthritis/rheumatism; 2) chronic back/
neck problems; 3) frequent/severe headaches; 4) medically
unexplained chronic pain; or 5) any other chronic pain?
Statistical Analysis

All analyses used the NCS-R’s weights to obtain estimates
representative of the US population in 2000. Part 1
weights were used for the analysis of variables from part 1,
part 2 weights were used for the analysis of part 2 varia134

bles, as well as for the regression analysis, in which variables from both parts were included.15 Analyses were
conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN statistical software (version 10.0.1; RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC), as appropriate.
Analyses were restricted to subjects aged 30 years
because no LTCS aged <30 years existed in the current
study sample. Significant differences between groups with
regard to demographic and psychiatric covariates were
assessed using 2-sided Student t tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. For each
outcome variable (use of a particular psychotropic medication class), we fit serial multivariable logistic regression
models to evaluate the association with case/control status
adjusting for other independent variables (covariates).
The first model was unadjusted; the second was adjusted
for demographic variables (age, income, sex, marital status, ethnicity, and education); and the third was adjusted
for demographic, medical (lifetime history of having had
chronic pain and a self-reported overall physical health
rating), and psychiatric (presence within the last 12
months of major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,
and alcohol or drug abuse) variables. From these models,
we generated unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with
95% confidence intervals. Tests were 2-sided and P values
<.05 were deemed statistically significant.
To understand whether the relationship between
psychotropic drug use and psychiatric diagnoses differed
by case-control status, we conducted separate bivariate
analyses for cases and controls evaluating the association
between psychotropic medication use (yes/no) and the
presence of a psychiatric diagnosis within the past year
(yes/no). Unfortunately, not all DSM-IV diagnoses were
available in the NCS-R and our conglomerate variable
(“carrying a psychiatric diagnosis”) consisted of attention
deficit disorder; agoraphobia with and without panic disorder; alcohol abuse and dependence; anorexia; binge eating disorder; bipolar disorder I, II, and subthreshold;
bulimia; conduct disorder; drug abuse and dependence;
dysthymia; generalized anxiety disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; major depressive episode; panic attack
and disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; social phobia;
specific phobia; and nicotine dependence. We tested the
interaction between case-control status and the presence
of a psychiatric diagnosis for its ability to predict use of
psychotropic medication in the logistic regression models,
unadjusted as well as adjusted for the abovementioned demographic and medical variables.

RESULTS
Of the 5692 NCS-R subjects who were queried regarding
their cancer history, 225 were identified as LTCS and
3953 as CNC aged >30 years. Excluded from analyses
were 159 subjects who reported cancer histories but did
not meet the criteria for LTCS. Table 1 shows the distribution of characteristics by cases and controls. In comparison with CNC, LTCS were likely to be older (mean age
of 59.5 years vs 49.2 years; P < .001); of lower income
(mean household income of $57,113 vs $63,532;
P 5.05); divorced, separated, or widowed (33.6% vs
25.1%; overall P < .001); and white (84.1% vs 76.2%;
overall P 5.002). Although they were found to be no
more likely than CNC to meet the criteria for a DSM-IV
diagnosis, they were significantly more likely to report a
lifetime history of having experienced chronic pain
(80.1% vs 63.6%; P < .001) and to rely on greater numbers of prescription and nonprescription medications,

psychiatric or otherwise (3.0% vs 1.8% [P < .001] and
2.3% vs 1.8% [P<.001], respectively). It is interesting to
note that these variables were included as covariates in the
study’s multivariable regression models.
For LTCS, the median age at the time of the cancer
diagnosis and the number of years from diagnosis were
47.6 years (standard error, 1.5) and 13.6 years (standard
error, 1.4), respectively. Since the NCS-R data were
originally collected, several cancer subtypes in the public
access database have been folded into the category of
“other” to minimize the risk of subject identification.
The current distribution of cancer subtypes in the sample is as follows: breast, 19.9%; melanoma, 19.6%; cervical, 15.1%; uterine/ovarian, 9.8%; prostate, 6.2%; and
other, 24.6%. Frequently nonlethal malignancies such as
breast, melanoma, and cervical cancers were the most
common, with >50% of the sample reporting at least 1
such diagnosis.

As depicted in Table 2, approximately 28.8% of
LTCS versus 22.3% of CNC reported using at least 1 psychotropic medication. This trend toward the increased
use of psychiatric medications among LTCS was replicated with antidepressants (19.6% vs 16.2%), tranquilizers (8.7% vs 6.2%), and sleeping medications (9.9% vs
8.6%), but not with antipsychotics (0.3% vs 1.2%),
stimulants (0.5% vs 0.7%), and psychotropic medications
with possible pain indications (27.0% vs 28.3%). As
depicted in Table 1, LTCS were no more likely than
CNC to receive a psychiatric medication from a psychiatrist as opposed to another provider (18.1% vs 25.8%;
P 5.15). LTCS were more likely to report “poor sleep” as
a reason for taking the psychotropic medications they
were receiving (10% vs 5.5%; P 5.02); there were no
other significant differences noted between LTCS and
CNC with regard to the reported reasons psychiatric medications were taken (Table 3).
Serially more complex regression analyses did not
reveal significant differences between LTCS and CNC
with regard to psychotropic medication use; only the
results from the fully adjusted model are presented in Table 2. LTCS did not demonstrate an increased odds of
psychotropic medication use compared with CNC in the
unadjusted or partially adjusted regression models. Similarly, there were no differences noted between LTCS and
CNC with regard to the use of specific categories of psychotropic medications. Unadjusted as well as controlling
for the covariates mentioned above, LTCS did not manifest increased odds of using antidepressants, tranquilizers,
sleeping pills, or psychotropic drugs with possible pain
indications. We did not report regression analyses for
amphetamines/stimulants and antipsychotics due to the
small numbers of individuals who reported using these

DISCUSSION

with regard to neuropsychiatric health, and to the best of
our knowledge is the first of its kind to rigorously evaluate
whether differential psychiatric medication use might
help to explain the absence of increased psychiatric diagnoses among LTCS. Although a trend toward LTCS taking more antidepressants and sedatives existed, this small
difference (6.5%) was neither clinically meaningful nor
statistically significant. Strikingly, with the exception of
insomnia, the reasons that LTCS and CNC turned to psychiatric medications were identical. In addition to the absence of a main effect, no significant interactions were
found; the relationship between taking a psychiatric medication and carrying a psychiatric diagnosis was not significantly different for LTCS and CNC. Taken together,
these findings suggest the absence of a prominent therapeutic bias toward LTCS. Furthermore, the results of the
current study depicted a LTCS population with rates of
psychiatric illness that were no higher than those of CNC,
if with a suggestion of elevated medical involvement (they
relied on greater quantities of total prescription and overthe-counter medications).
The findings of the current study reinforce an
emerging hypothesis that, on the whole, posttreatment
LTCS resemble the general population with regard to
mental health symptoms.7-10,16,17 Certainly, this conclusion excludes cancer survivors who are <5 years from diagnosis as well as those >5 years from diagnosis but still
with active disease. Nonetheless, this news will likely reassure patients in active treatment or early survivorship who
are diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or cognitive symptoms and fearing symptom permanence. It invites further
research into 1) subpopulations of LTCS who might be
differentially vulnerable to long-lasting neuropsychiatric
sequelae; and 2) the possibility that LTCS experience
nonspecific psychiatric distress or isolated symptoms,
such as insomnia, that in themselves do not meet the criteria for a psychiatric syndrome.
There are several important limitations to the current study. First, NCS-R data, including health status,
were gleaned through self-report and did not rely on
objective measures such as medical records. Second,
details of the subjects’ cancer histories (eg, cancer grade,
stage, and treatment characteristics) were lacking. Third,
225 cancer survivors may not allow for enough power to
detect subtle differences between groups with regard to
some of the variables of interest, including the use of psychotropic medications. Particular types of LTCS may
have significantly higher rates of psychotropic drug use
compared with controls, but were either excluded from
the study by virtue of being institutionalized or were too
Cancer

small in number to impact the study’s findings. For example, the median duration since cancer diagnosis was
approximately 14 years (a finding common to
population-based studies of LTCS), raising the possibility
that increased rates of psychiatric disorders exist among
LTCS closer to the time of diagnosis and treatment.4,7-11
Particularly because modest psychosocial interventions
can improve mental health among LTCS, another weakness is that the number of individuals who answered
queries regarding psychotherapy were too small to be
included in analyses.18 Finally, the current study
neglected subsyndromal dysphoria and anxiety, as well as
illness concerns (ie, fear of disease recurrence) that are
likely to be prevalent among cancer survivors but do not
necessarily trigger psychiatric diagnoses. The results of the
current study should not be taken to negate the existence
or functional impact of these psychological symptoms for
certain LTCS.
The current study also possesses important
strengths. The majority of studies evaluating the mental
health of LTCS have focused on one or a few cancer types,
chiefly cancers of the breast and prostate.16,18 By contrast,
the current study used a nationally representative sampling methodology supporting maximal ecological validity. Second, the NCS-R allowed for precise, Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID)-based definitions of psychiatric diagnoses. Similarly, the NCS-R
was rigorous in its data collection with regard to medication use. Expert synthesis of the pharmacoepidemiologic
literature indicates that, overall, individuals are able to
accurately report current and past medication use, particularly when the process is aided by a list of drug names, as
it was in NCS-R interviews.19 Furthermore, interviewers
were trained to be persistent in their quest for a complete
list of psychotropic drugs used by respondents. Because
interviews were conducted in the respondent’s home,
interviewers were encouraged to review medication
bottles.
The role of the psychiatrist or other prescriber treating LTCS encompasses a set of issues beyond writing prescriptions. Experience in working with patients with
cancer helps providers to recognize the range of expected
and reasonable emotional states in cancer survivors in
comparison with physically healthy patients with mood or
anxiety disorders that require drug interventions, and also
to work with long-term survivorship comorbidities and
drug interactions that are less commonly encountered by
generalists. Nonetheless, the findings of the current study
may have implications for the allotment of specialized
mental health resources for cancer survivors. For example,
137

Original Article

the increased education of mental health generalists
regarding cancer-specific considerations may enable the
majority of LTCS to receive quality care in a community
setting as opposed to a cancer center or other cancerspecific setting. In a resource-constrained environment,
further research into the question of how to appropriately
allocate mental health resources for cancer survivors is certainly warranted.
