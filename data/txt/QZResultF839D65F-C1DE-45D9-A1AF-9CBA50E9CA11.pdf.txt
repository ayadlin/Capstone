BACKGROUND: This study sought to characterize Modern patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and identify pretreatment clinical predictors of survival. METHODS: A cohort of men with CRPC with and without metastases (M) treated with secondary hormonal therapy (2eHT) and/or chemotherapy (CT) was identified from the authors’ institutional database. Associations of
patient and disease characteristics at diagnosis, at androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) initiation, at CRPC index date, and survival
were evaluated. CRPC index date was defined as the start date of either 2eHT or CT, whichever came first. RESULTS: In the cohort of
622 men, 434 men (70%) had M-positive disease; 552 men (89%) received 2eHT and 70 men (11%) received CT as their initial CRPC
treatment. There were 410 deaths (66%) at the time of analysis. Median overall survival (OS) was 35 months (quartile 1, quartile 3: 21
months, 61 months). In multivariate analyses, higher biopsy Gleason score, the presence of M at ADT initiation, shorter time from ADT
start to CRPC, higher prostate-specific antigen and poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at CRPC and M
at CRPC were predictive of shorter OS. Interestingly, whereas some men with biopsy Gleason scores of 6 died of their disease
(N 5 42), they had a longer OS after CRPC compared with those with a Gleason score  7. CONCLUSIONS: This large retrospective
study of patients with CRPC in a tertiary cancer center shows that biopsy Gleason score of 6 is associated with a less aggressive
C 2013
CRPC course, and the impact that M at ADT initiation and CRPC have on outcome is quantified. Cancer 2013;119:2990-8. V

INTRODUCTION
The number of treatment options demonstrating a survival benefit for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) has greatly increased since 2004, when docetaxel was shown to provide a survival benefit (eg, abiraterone, sipuleucel-T).1-4
When patients develop CRPC, the ability to evaluate prognosis is critical in order to counsel patients effectively
about long-term outlook and for identification of optimal treatment. In the CRPC population, pretreatment nomograms
predicting survival have been developed and validated and are widely used.5,6 In addition, a series of prognostic models
have been published in relation to clinical trials evaluating response to certain drugs; however, the majority of those studies
were conducted solely in patients with metastatic CRPC.7
In our practice, 70% of patients have metastases when they develop CRPC and 30% do not.8 In general, the diagnosis of CRPC is followed by treatment with sequential secondary hormonal therapies (2eHT) before initiating chemotherapy. However, a subset of patients have rapidly progressive disease and receive chemotherapy rather than 2eHT when they
develop CRPC. A better understanding of the clinical course of patients placed on 2eHT versus chemotherapy at CRPC
and identifying clinical predictors of outcomes can help physicians negotiate complex treatment decisions.
The objective of this study was to characterize a modern CRPC patient population and to identify clinical predictors
of survival in men with CRPC before treatment using our institutional clinical database of patients treated with a series of
CRPC treatments at a large tertiary cancer center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database

This cohort was generated from the Prostate Clinical
Research Information System (CRIS) database at DanaFarber Cancer Institute (DFCI).9 The DFCI Institutional
Review Board approved this study. All patients provided
written informed consent allowing analysis of clinical data
for research purposes. Data are stored in an Oracle database (Oracle, Redwood Shores, Calif). In general, all
patients seen at DFCI with a diagnosis of prostate cancer
are approached to participate in the database. The current
version of the Prostate CRIS database became available
for prospective data entry in November 2001. The consent rate is 86%. All clinical data in CRIS is quality controlled (QC) on a regular basis; the most recent QC
demonstrated a  10% error rate.
Eligibility

Eligible patients included those with CRPC treated with
2eHT and/or chemotherapy and who received primary
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) after 1996. Patients
were excluded from the analysis if systemic data problems
were identified during QC or if they received abiraterone,
because this agent was not approved at the time of the current study’s data cutoff date.
Quality Control

For this study, a physician (M.N.) reviewed the medical
records of approximately 10% of the original cohort
(N 5 822). Overall, 378 data points were reviewed, and
the database’s data were 86% concordant with the data
generated from this review.
Statistical Analysis

Patient and disease characteristics were summarized as
numbers and percentages for categorical variables; continuous variables were summarized with either a mean and
standard deviation or a median and interquartile range.
The CRPC index date was defined as start date of first
treatment for CRPC.
Duration of primary ADT was defined as time
between date of first injection of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist/antagonist or date of bilateral
orchiectomy and CRPC index date. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT were not included in the duration of primary
ADT. Duration of subsequent therapy for CRPC was calculated as the time between the start date of treatment and
the start date of subsequent treatment. The primary outcome variables were overall survival (OS) and maximal
percent prostate-specific antigen (%PSA) change from
Cancer

baseline during first CRPC treatment. Maximal %PSA
change was calculated as percent difference between the
smallest PSA value during the first CRPC treatment and
the PSA value prior to initiation of first CRPC treatment.
When patients are still alive or lost to follow-up, OS
was censored either at date of last follow-up, last known
PSA level, or imaging date, whichever comes latest. The
OS distribution (median and 95% confidence intervals
[CIs]) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
modeling was used to assess the association of patient and
disease characteristics prior to CRPC treatment initiation
with OS from CRPC. Univariate and Cox proportional
hazards modeling was conducted to evaluate the association between OS from second-line CRPC treatment and
maximal %PSA decline from baseline during first-line
CRPC treatment. Continuous characteristics were dichotomized at the median value within the cohort. An
unknown category was created for any missing data in
order to include all patients in the analysis.
The statistical analysis was performed using SAS,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and P < .05 (2sided) was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Study Cohort

A total of 822 patients treated with 2eHT and/or chemotherapy for CRPC were identified in our database9; 200
patients were excluded from further analysis for lack of
documentation of 2eHT or chemotherapy (CT) for
CRPC (N 5 56), absence of follow-up data (N 5 41),
ADT start date in 1995 or before (N 5 75), or database
error (N 5 28). The final cohort consisted of 622
patients. Subjects were initiated with primary ADT
between January 1996 and June 2010. Median follow-up
after diagnosis was 7.3 years (quartile 1, quartile 3: 3.8
years, 11.4 years).
Patient and Disease Characteristics

Overall, 552 men (89%) received 2eHT as first
CRPC treatment (2eHT-first) whereas 70 men (11%)
received CT as first CRPC treatment (CT-first) (Table 1).
Notably, 268 (43%) patients had biopsy Gleason score of
8 or greater disease, and 235 (38%) had clinically localized disease at diagnosis and were considered high-risk
according to D’Amico criteria (T2c or PSA > 20 or
Gleason score  8); only 32 men (5%) had low-risk disease ( T2a and PSA  10 ng/mL and biopsy Gleason
score  6), 26 men (5%) in the 2eHT-first group and 6

had metastatic disease at diagnosis.
Men treated with chemotherapy as initial CRPC
therapy were significantly more likely to have metastatic
disease at diagnosis and to exhibit a shorter time from diagnosis to CRPC index date as well as shorter time from
ADT start to CRPC index date.
At CRPC index date, patients who received CT-first
were 5 years younger (P 5 .0012), had significantly higher
PSA (median PSA 5 31.3 ng/mL [quartile 1, quartile 3:
4.1 ng/mL, 140.0 ng/mL] versus 7.0 ng/mL [quartile 1,
quartile 3: 2.1 ng/mL, 18.4 ng/mL] in the 2eHT-first
group, P < .0001) and were more likely to have metastatic
disease (94% versus 67%; P < .0001) than the 2eHT-first
group. Chemotherapy was given first in 4 men with metastasis (M)-negative disease because their PSA doubling
time on primary ADT was less than 3 months.

10-27 months). Docetaxel was the most commonly used
first-line CT agent, followed by mitoxantrone.
Median maximal %PSA change on any type of first
CRPC treatment was 225% (quartile 1, quartile 3:
increase of 32%, decline of 70%). For 2eHT-first
patients, median maximal PSA decline was 24% (quartile
1, quartile 3: increase of 33%, decrease of 69%) and for
CT-first patients, it was 30% (quartile 1, quartile 3:
increase of 12%, decrease of 75%). Median time to maximal PSA decline during the any-first CRPC treatment
was 2.0 months (quartile 1, quartile 3: 1 months, 4
months) (N 5 496). In univariate analysis, a maximal
%PSA decline < 25% (from baseline during any-first
CRPC treatment regardless of the type of treatment) was
significantly associated with a shorter OS from secondline CRPC treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 5 0.64,
P < .0001).

Univariate Analysis: OS From CRPC Index Date

Statistically significant predictors of longer OS from
CRPC index date included biopsy Gleason score  6,
PSA level at ADT start (< 18.4 ng/mL) and at CRPC
index date (< 7.8 ng/mL), absence of M disease, time
from ADT start to CRPC index date (duration of primary
ADT; > 19 months) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status 0 at CRPC index
date (Table 2). PSA at diagnosis was not associated with
OS from CRPC index date.
Multivariate Analysis

In multivariable analysis, statistically significant factors of
longer OS were biopsy Gleason score  6, absence of metastatic disease at ADT initiation, longer time from ADT
start to CRPC index date (duration of primary ADT),

Gleason  6 Cancer Can Progress to CRPC

A total of 81 (13%) men in the cohort who developed
CRPC had Gleason  6 disease at diagnosis. Given the
significant association of Gleason  6 with OS in this
cohort, we further characterized the differences in clinical
characteristics between men with biopsy Gleason  6 and
Gleason  7 disease (Table 4). At diagnosis, men with
biopsy Gleason  6 disease were slightly older than those
with higher Gleason scores (62.9 versus 61.2 years,
P 5 .040). None of the patients with biopsy Gleason
scores  6 had N1 or M1 disease. Thirty-two men (40%)
were classified as having low-risk disease, and 93% (75)
received definitive local therapy, as compared to 61%
(276) men with Gleason 7 or above at diagnosis
(P < .0001). Men with biopsy Gleason score  6 disease
experienced a more indolent course than men with higher
Gleason scores: duration of primary ADT was 10 months
longer (28 versus 18 months) (P 5 .0016), median time
from diagnosis to CRPC index date was 5.6 years longer

Gleason Upgrading in Men With Biopsy Gleason
Score  6

Among 44 patients (54%) who had biopsy Gleason
score  6 and radical prostatectomy (RP), RP pathology was available in 42 men (52%) (2 cases with
RP Gleason grading unknown). Gleason score was
upgraded to Gleason score  7 in 32 patients (76%)
after RP. Notably, in only 15 cases were both biopsy
and RP Gleason scores reviewed at the same institution. The remaining 27 cases were reviewed at outside hospitals. There were 18 deaths in 32 patients

whose Gleason score was upgraded and 7 deaths in
10 patients whose Gleason score was not upgraded.
DISCUSSION
This study represents the largest cohort to date reporting
the natural history of CRPC treated at a large tertiary cancer center. In the current cohort, clinical predictors of OS
include biopsy Gleason score, presence of metastatic disease at ADT initiation and at CRPC (not at diagnosis),
duration of primary hormonal therapy, PSA at CRPC, as
well as ECOG performance status at CRPC.
In this cohort, 10% of all CRPC patients received
CT first for CRPC. We found that patients who receive
CT first for CRPC differ substantially from those who
first receive 2eHT; the CT-first group were slightly
younger at CRPC, demonstrated a shorter duration of
response to primary ADT, had higher PSA levels, and
were more likely to have metastatic disease when they
developed CRPC. In our current practice, medical oncologists are concerned that this type of disease is less likely
to be responsive to hormonal therapy and are more
inclined to start CT as initial treatment for CRPC. It is
interesting that physician practice, by initiating CT
instead of starting 2eHT for first-line CRPC treatment,
turned out to be prognostic.
We also examined the association of response to
first-line CRPC treatment and OS. Maximal PSA
decline < 25% from baseline during the first-line CRPC
treatment (regardless of type of treatment) was significantly associated with shorter survival. Notably, our findings are similar to previously published results of the
TAX327 and SWOG 99-06 studies in which PSA decline
of 30% within 3 months of treatment initiation provided
surrogacy for OS.10,11 The presented 30% cutoff had a
higher degree of statistical surrogacy than traditional 50%
cutoff by using the most stringent surrogacy criterion, the
proportion of treatment effect explained (PTE) in
SWOG 99-06.12
In this study, we found that 13% of men with
CRPC had biopsy Gleason  6 disease at diagnosis. The
median follow-up of this patient population was 12.4
years: median time from diagnosis to CRPC in these men
was 9 years (compared with 3.4 years in men with higher
Gleason scores). Even after developing CRPC, biopsy
Gleason  6 cancer continued to behave less aggressively
than Gleason  7 disease. These data are informative
given the recent interest in active surveillance for men
with low-risk prostate cancer.
With early detection of prostate cancer by PSA
screening, the number of men diagnosed with low-risk
Cancer

disease has significantly increased. The recent publication
of Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial
(PIVOT) study provided some insight into the natural
history of low-risk disease in the post-PSA era.13 In that
study, a total of 731 men were randomized to RP or
watchful waiting (WW) and followed for a median of 10
years. Although the study was underpowered, consisted of
older patients (mean age 67), and 20% men on WW were
treated with curative intent, a subgroup analysis of 148
men with low-risk disease showed no benefit to RP over
WW in OS or prostate cancer-specific death.
However, with longer follow-up, the current study
identified a subset of men with biopsy Gleason  6 cancer
that progressed to a lethal disease after treatment. The
magnitude of this subset is no doubt influenced by referral
bias to our tertiary cancer center, as is the fact that only
40% of these men with biopsy Gleason  6 in our cohort
had low-risk disease. However, the existence of these men
identified with lethal disease after many years should be
recognized by all practitioners. Observation for men with
low-risk prostate cancer has gained increasing attention in
recent years, and the identification of men with lethal biopsy Gleason  6 disease in our cohort underscores the
need for improved prognostic tools such as biomarkers to
distinguish lethal from indolent disease at diagnosis.
Retrospective database studies of prostate cancer are
plagued by limitations regarding Gleason scoring, in particular the shift to higher Gleason scores over time and
interobserver variability among pathologists.14 This
cohort consists of a heterogeneous population spanning
more than 30 years (prostate cancer diagnosis ranged
from 1977 to 2010). In our referral clinic, central pathology review of all outside biopsy and RP samples is impossible. Therefore, our conclusions regarding the natural
history of Gleason score 6 disease reflect the heterogeneity
of community grading as well as changing practices with
regard to Gleason grading and to biopsy technique over
these years. In addition, it has been reported consistently
in the literature that approximately 30% of cancers are
upgraded from biopsy Gleason score at RP (consistent
with our unpublished data; Yoo S et al, March 2013). In
this cohort, 76% of Gleason score 6 cancers were
upgraded. However, given that our pathology was not
centrally reviewed, it is difficult to assess the impact of this
finding. Because of these limitations, it must be emphasized that conclusions regarding Gleason scoring in this
article reflect the grading practices in the community over
the past 3 decades.
The pathological features at RP for low-risk disease
are not uniformly favorable; increasingly, the proportion
2997

Original Article

of Gleason pattern 4 in RP specimen is being recognized
as a critical factor in predicting biochemical recurrence
and prostate cancer specific mortality.15 According to
recent studies, tertiary 4 pattern in Gleason  6 cancer
could increase the risk of relapse.16 Because of the retrospective nature of our study, evaluation of the volume of
high grade cancer in initial biopsy specimens is not feasible; however, we could speculate that tertiary 4 patterns
might have played a role in the development of lethal
Gleason  6 cancers in our cohort. Characterization of
pathological Gleason patterns using RP specimens to
identify molecular markers that define the aggressiveness
of low-risk disease is currently ongoing.
In this study, we present a natural history of CRPC
patients treated at a large tertiary cancer center and identify clinical predictors of survival in contemporary
patients with CRPC regardless of the status of metastatic
disease. The present cohort demonstrates that despite
mounting evidence that many men with low-risk prostate
cancer are treated unnecessarily, biopsy Gleason  6 cancer can progress to CRPC after a median of 12.4 years;
however, even in these men with lethal disease, initial
Gleason score continues to be a useful tool to predict outcomes. Further studies are warranted to understand and
predict the different biological behavior of individual cancers in order to select the most effective treatment for individual patients. The predictors identified in this study
must be validated in a prospective study.
