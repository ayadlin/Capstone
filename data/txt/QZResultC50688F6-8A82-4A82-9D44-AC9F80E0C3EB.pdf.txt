BACKGROUND. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the biochemical effects of gefitinib on its target signal-transduction pathways in patients with
recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The secondary objectives included
assessing clinical activity and toxicity and determining the association between
biochemical and clinical outcomes.

METHODS. Twenty-four heavily pretreated patients with EOC who had good
end-organ function and performance status and who had measurable disease received gefitinib 500 mg daily. Prospectively planned core-needle tumor biopsies were obtained before treatment and after 4 weeks. Protein
expression of total and phosphorylated (p) epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)

was quantified in microdissected tumor cells using tissue lysate array proteomics.

RESULTS. All tumor samples had detectable levels of EGFR and p-EGFR. A
decrease in the quantity of both EGFR and p-EGFR was observed with gefitinib
therapy in >50% of patients. This was not associated with clinical benefit, nor
were responses observed. However, trends for increased gastrointestinal and skin
toxicity were observed with greater phosphorylation or quantities of EGFR, ERK,
and AKT in tumor samples (P  .05). Gefitinib had limited clinical activity as
monotherapy despite documented target inhibition.

CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study demonstrated that gefitinib inhibited
the phosphorylation of EGFR in EOC tumor cells, providing proof of target in a
clinical setting. Combinatorial therapy with molecular therapeutics against complementary targets may prove successful. Cancer 2007;109:1323–30.

pithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from
gynecologic malignancy among American women.1 Debulking
surgery followed by adjuvant platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy
is highly effective in remitting disease.2 However, most women who
are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease eventually develop recurrences. Various cytotoxic agents are used that produce response
rates in the range of 10% to 30%. In all, approximately 70% of all
women who are diagnosed with EOC will die of their disease. Thus,

there is a critical need for the development and
assessment of new agents.
One potential target for anticancer therapy is the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a
regulator of cell growth and differentiation in normal
tissues and plays a role in promoting cell proliferation, apoptosis inhibition, and angiogenesis in malignancy.3–5 EGFR is overexpressed in from 35% to 70%
of epithelial ovarian cancers, depending on the
assessment technique used.6,7 Increased EGFR signaling has been associated with the development of
an invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer cell lines8,9
and is detected more often in metastases than in primary tumor samples.10 The relation between EGFR
overexpression and clinical prognosis is less clear,
with some reports suggesting a prognostic importance5,7 and others refuting that association.11 EGFR
homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with other members of the erbB family upon ligand binding.12,13 This
leads to activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase
domain, autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation, and initiation of downstream signaling cascades.5,14
EGFR is a promising target for molecular therapeutics because of its well-studied prosurvival role.
Both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR have been tested in
the clinic.4,15,16 Gefitinib (Iressa) is a small-molecule
inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase of EGFR. It attaches
to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding domain
of the receptor, preventing phosphorylation and activation of both EGFR and important downstream signaling molecules.17 Gefitinib inhibits EGF-stimulated
growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro; this effect is
cytostatic, with an increase in apoptosis observed at
higher doses and when, used in combination with
conventional chemotherapy, producing supraadditive
growth arrest.18,19 Gefitinib also has been tested in
xenograft models of ovarian cancer, resulting in inhibitory effects on cell growth and increased survival
of mice in the treatment groups.16,20
Phase I trials of gefitinib in solid tumors, including EOC, have demonstrated tolerable toxicity and
promising clinical results.15,21–24 We hypothesized
that gefitinib would inhibit the activation of EGFR in
patients with ovarian cancer, effect downstream signal-transduction events, and lead to regression or
stabilization of disease. The primary objective of this
study was to evaluate the biochemical effects of gefitinib on signal-transduction pathways in tumor. The
secondary objectives included assessing the clinical
activity and toxicity of gefitinib in EOC and determining the association between biochemical and
clinical outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD).
Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment. Eligible patients had histopathologically confirmed EOC. All patients had progressing disease and
were 4 weeks from their most recent therapeutic
intervention. Other criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, a
leukocyte count 3000/mm3, platelets 100,000/mm3,
serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL, transaminase levels
(alanine and aspartate aminotransferase) 2.5 3 the
upper limit of normal, bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, measurable disease on a computed tomography (CT) scan, and
a sentinel lesion amenable to percutaneous biopsy.
Toxicity from prior therapies must have recovered to
grade 1. Patients with evidence of central nervous system involvement, a history of myocardial infarction or
angina within the previous 6 months, a history of
another invasive malignancy within 5 years, ongoing or
active infection, previous treatment with any EGFR inhibitor, and concurrent treatment with alternative or
complementary medications were excluded from study.

Treatment Plan
Patients received oral gefitinib 500 mg daily on 28-day
cycles until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
or withdrawal. They were seen every 4 weeks for history, physical, and pelvic examinations and laboratory
tests, including CA125. Response was assessed every 8
weeks by imaging studies and was scored according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.25 All
patients were required to keep a diary to document
compliance and adverse events. Toxicity was assessed
by using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). Symptomatic management
was provided to patients with gastrointestinal and dermatologic toxicities. Grade 3 or hematologic grade 4
toxicities required treatment interruption until they
resolved to grade 1. Patients were not eligible to resume therapy if the time to resolution was >2 weeks
or 4 weeks if they had evidence of clinical benefit.
Patients had their gefitinib dose reduced to 250 mg
daily in the setting of grade 3 or 4 toxicity or of recurrent grade 2 dermatologic toxicity. Further dose reductions were not allowed.
The study prospectively planned the collection of
percutaneous 18-g core-needle tumor biopsies to evaluate target modulation. Biopsies were obtained under
imaging guidance prior to initiation and after 4 weeks
of gefitinib treatment and were cryopreserved immediately in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance,

Gefitinib in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer/Posadas et al.

CA). Biopsy sections that measured 6 lm were cut for
pathology review and laser-capture microdissection
(LCM) (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Samples
with predominant necrosis or lymphocytic infiltration
were not assayed. Tumor and stromal cells were collected by using LCM as reported previously26,27 and
were analyzed independently.

Tissue Lysate Array Preparation and Analysis
Captured cells were lysed, and the proteins were
extracted as described previously28 in a 1:1 preparation of Tris-glycine/sodium dodecyl sulfate sample
buffer (Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent; Pierce,
Rockford, IL) plus 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol for 30
minutes at 758C. An estimated 30,000 cells were
obtained yielding 30 lL of lysate to print 30 replicate
arrays. EGF-treated A431 cell lysate (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) was used as a positive control. Lysates
were loaded into 384-well plates in a 5-point 1:1
dilution curve and printed in triplicate onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (Schleicher and Schuell
Bioscience, Keene, NH) using a GMS 417 pin and
ring arrayer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)29 and were
stored desiccated at 208C. Arrays were incubated
with Reblot antibody stripping solution (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA), rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline,
and blocked in I-Block (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Each slide was probed with primary antibody (Table 1) using an automated slide stainer
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and detected with the Dako
Catalyzed Signal Amplification system.30 Primary
antibody was omitted on 1 slide to serve as the nonspecific background control. One slide from each set
was stained with Sypro ruby stain to quantitate total
protein load (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and was
visualized on a FluorChem imaging system (Alpha
Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Protein intensity was
quantified from stained arrays using ImageQuant
(version 5.2; Molecular Dynamics; Sunnyvale, CA).
Expression signals were normalized to total protein
content then standardized to a control lysate of A431
cells printed onto each slide.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint was defined prospectively as
the modulation of EGFR, protein kinase B (AKT), and
extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK) after 1 month of
gefitinib therapy. Secondary endpoints included clinical response and toxicity and the association of clinical and biochemical effects. We estimated that a
minimum of 15 paired tumor biopsies would be
required to address the primary endpoint. This number would be adequate to detect a difference of 1
standard deviation of change with 80% power,

assuming that a 1-tailed t test would be used at the
.008 significance level based on an assumption of
undertaking 6 paired comparisons to allow at least
implicitly for a Bonferroni correction that accounted
for multiple comparisons.

Triplicate values were averaged to yield the single
NIV for a given tissue-lysate array (TLA) parameter
at a given time (pretreatment or posttreatment) for
either tumor or stroma. The relative difference used
for analysis after determining that the actual difference was more dependent on pretreatment than the
relative difference and, hence, was less suitable as an
endpoint. It was defined as follows: (posttreatment
valuepretreatment value)/pretreatment value. A 2tailed Wilcoxon signed rank-test was used to determine whether the relative changes between posttreatment and pretreatment differed from zero. An
exact Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test was used to test
for an association between grade of gastrointestinal
toxicity or worst toxicity and each TLA parameter.
Parameters in patients with or without diarrhea or
skin toxicity were compared using an exact Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. In view of the large number of parameters that ultimately were evaluated in this exploratory study, although no formal correction for
multiple comparisons was performed, a P value
<.005 was considered necessary to interpret a result
as statistically significant, whereas .005 < P < .05
would suggest a trend.

Patients
Twenty-four patients with recurrent EOC were enrolled between November 2002 and January 2005 to

demographics are summarized in Table 2. No patient
had a kinase-activating EGFR mutation (data not
shown).

Tumor Response
Sixteen patients completed 2 cycles of therapy and,
thus, were evaluable for clinical assessment. There
were no complete or partial responses. The median
time on treatment was 2 months (range, from 3 days
to 5 months). Nine patients (37%) had stable disease
for >2 months. CA125 values were consistent with
radiographic changes: Fifteen patients had a steady
rise in CA125 value during treatment, and 8 patients
had a decrease at some point during treatment,
including 4 patients who were on study for 4
months. One patient presented with a solid cervical
lymph node mass that became soft and fluctuant 3
months into therapy. A CT scan showed the development of cystic regions in the mass and histologically
necrotic tumor tissue with a few viable tumor cells
in the floor of the cavity. The patient had progressive
disease after 4 months of therapy despite this promising beginning.
Safety and Toxicity

mild. The most common adverse events attributed to

rhea was managed successfully with loperamide therapy in most patients. An acneiform rash was observed
in 42% of patients and improved with topical clindamycin treatment. Five patients had asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases and/or alkaline
phosphatase. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities related to gefitinib administration were rare. Grade 4 hyponatremia
was reported in a patient who had multiple baseline
electrolyte abnormalities resulting from short bowel
syndrome and underlying adrenal insufficiency: She
experienced drug-related, grade 3 liver enzyme elevations. A patient who was receiving enoxaparin for a
synthetic aortic graft developed a grade 4 hemorrhage
because of splenic rupture. Its attribution to gefitinib
treatment was unclear. Thirty percent of patients
required dose modification to 250 mg per day; 1
patient was reduced during Cycle 1, 3 patients were
reduced in Cycle 2, and 3 patients were reduced at or
after Cycle 3. Seven patients required short treatment
interruptions for recovery of diarrhea or fatigue (median, 3.5 days; range, 1–10 days). Both patients with
grade 4 toxicity had treatment discontinued.

Signal Profiling
Pretreatment and posttreatment tumor specimens
were obtained from 23 patients and 18 patients,
respectively; the disease sites are listed in Table 4.
No second biopsy was obtained if there was no solid
tumor in the first biopsy or if treatment was discontinued early. No complications occurred during sample acquisition. Several biopsies were considered

unsuitable for microdissection because of the absence of tumor, excessive lymphocyte infiltration, or
overwhelming necrosis. Matched data on protein
expression in stroma were available for a limited
number of patients, because many biopsies had
minimal dissectable stroma. Fifteen paired tumor
biopsies were used for proteomic evaluation.

Demonstration of target modulation
Target quantity and phosphorylation could be measured in varied numbers of patients (Table 5). Figure 1
shows changes in the primary parameters of total and
phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) (pY-1148), AKT, and
ERK with 1 month of gefitinib therapy. The ratio of NIV
values are presented for expression of the protein in tumor obtained during gefitinib therapy as a function of
baseline values. Reductions in total EGFR and p-EGFR
were observed in several patients. However, no absolute or relative differences were considered suggestive
of a significant change.
Clinical association with signaling events
The extent of adverse events observed was associated
with changes in signaling parameters in several
instances. Tables 5 and 6 show sample statistics for
signaling parameters and clinical toxicity by grade
and type of toxicity for those parameters for which
there was at least a trend toward an association
between relative change in the parameter and the
type of toxicity noted. Increasing EGFR, AKT, p-ERK,
and p-EGFR moieties in tumor on treatment demonstrated at least a trend toward an association with
increasing overall toxicity (P  .05), gastrointestinal
toxicity (P < .05), and skin toxicity (P 5 .03). No pretreatment biochemical parameters were predictive of
toxicity. Several strong trends were observed in this
study and will need to be confirmed in a larger cohort
because of the small number of patients studied.

despite the lack of an activating mutation. We were
able to demonstrate that gefitinib inhibits the phosphorylation of EGFR in ovarian cancer cells, providing proof of target in a clinical setting. It also has
been shown that gefitinib inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of EGFR with the corresponding
inhibition of downstream signaling cascades and a
decrease in cell proliferation and tumor cell growth
in laboratory and animal models.16 Prior preclinical
and clinical studies have shown decreased EGFR and
diminished activation in unproven surrogates.19,32 To
our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to
provide tumor-specific evidence of tyrosine kinase
inhibition by gefitinib in a clinical setting. We also

demonstrated that inhibition of p-EGFR results in
the inhibition of downstream signaling molecules
known to transmit the EGFR growth response. A
decrease in phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK
was observed with gefitinib therapy. These results in
ovarian cancer are similar to recent data in breast
cancer that indicated a down-regulation of p-EGFR
with gefitinib therapy, as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of sequential tumor biopsies.33
Less downstream inhibition was observed in the
breast cancer cohort with a decrease in p-ERK but
not p-AKT in tumor cells. A 500-mg dose of gefitinib
daily was effective biochemically in tumor cells from
patients with ovarian cancer.
Gefitinib had limited activity as monotherapy in
this population of heavily pretreated patients with
recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer despite some
target inhibition in 82% of patients. No patient
attained stabilization of disease of at least 6 months,
which was the clinical target parameter. The gefitinib
Phase II trial for ovarian cancer patients coordinated
by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG 170C) had
a primary endpoint of progression-free survival,34
and the patients were limited to fewer prior treatment regimens. Similar to our trial, the median number of cycles received by patients in the GOG trial
was 2 cycles. Four patients achieved stable disease
for >6 months, and 1 partial response was observed
in a patient who had an EGFR mutation. It has been
demonstrated that activating mutations of EGFR predict the response to gefitinib in some patients. The
majority of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer

Gefitinib in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer/Posadas et al.

(NSCLC) who responded to gefitinib (77% in recently
compiled data from multiple trials) had mutations of
EGFR in or near the ATP-binding region of the kinase
domain; these mutations were observed rarely in
patients with NSCLC who did not respond.35–38 The
somewhat more promising results from the GOG trial
may have been caused by differences in the patient
populations. Our more heavily pretreated patient
population was a group known to have limited response to new agents.39
The adverse events observed in the current trial
generally were mild and were comparable to those
observed in other Phase II trials of gefitinib33,40–42:
diarrhea and rash, which are common adverse
events with gefitinib. Greater quantities or phosphorylation of EGFR or its downstream signaling partners were associated with increased overall,
gastrointestinal, and skin toxicities in our study.
These toxicities and their associations imply effective levels of EGFR inhibition in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. The lack of clinical activity of
single-agent gefitinib, despite some target effects in
tumor tissue, indicates that the presence and extent
of these toxicities cannot be used as surrogates for
intratumoral effects.
The question presented by this trial is the lack
of an association between the biochemical and clinical effects of gefitinib. It appears that blocking the
activity of the EGFR kinase is not sufficient to produce a clinical effect in ovarian cancer. There are 3
possible explanations: 1) the target is not important
in the tumor biology; 2) the target is important, but
its modulation is not sufficient; or 3) the target is
important and is inhibited sufficiently, but this
effect can be overcome by paracrine or parallel signaling to the same downstream targets. The second
explanation implies a possible incomplete inhibition
of EGFR phosphorylation. The necessary threshold
for EGFR inhibition and the specific key phosphorylation sites are unknown. Although a decrease
>50% was observed in the level of p-EGFR expression, detectable levels of p-EGFR still were present
in all tumor biopsies, and the proportion of EGFR
activation remained unchanged by treatment. This
may be adequate to stimulate tumor growth and
proliferation. There are other promalignant pathways that promote tumor development and survival
in molecularly heterogeneous cancers like ovarian
cancer.43 These progrowth molecular signals may
compensate for or overcome inhibition of the EGFR
pathway. The finding that EGFR phosphorylation
has a limited clinical effect but has biochemical activity provides additional rationale for the exploration of gefitinib in combination with signal-

1329

transduction inhibitors that effect downstream targets. The inhibition of 1 pathway at multiple levels
or of several pathways in parallel may have an additive or even supraadditive effect.
This study also demonstrated that tissue lysate
arrays may be a sensitive technique for detecting
protein expression and activation in ovarian cancer.
They provide a method for quantifying protein expression, something that cannot be achieved easily
with immunohistochemistry.28,29 Tissue lysate arrays
also allow the simultaneous study of a large number
of protein endpoints. Our proteomic evaluation, as a
pilot study, was relatively limited; potentially, up to
30 different proteins could be probed in the analysis
of 1 small tumor biopsy. Although the use of tissue
lysate arrays in the clinical setting still is exploratory,
the current study has demonstrated the feasibility
and applicability of the technique to monitoring biochemical responses to molecularly targeted therapies.
