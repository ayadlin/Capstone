BACKGROUND. Previous studies have evaluated 3-week and weekly docetaxel
schedules in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The varying efficacy
results and toxicity profiles noted in these earlier studies led to a comparison of
the schedules to determine which was safer and more efficacious.
METHODS. A phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in patients with MBC who were
treated with docetaxel either every 3 weeks or once weekly to determine and
compare response rate and duration, time to disease progression, progressionfree survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Patients were randomized
to receive docetaxel at a starting dose of either 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or 35
mg/m2 weekly for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest.

RESULTS. A total of 118 patients underwent efficacy analysis; 59 patients were
randomized to the every-3-week treatment arm and 59 to the weekly arm. The
response rate was 35.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 23.6–49.1%) for the
every-3-week arm versus 20.3% (95% CI, 11.0–32.8%) for the weekly arm. There
was no statistical difference between the every 3-week and the weekly treatment
arms with regard to median PFS (5.7 months vs 5.5 months; P 5 .46) or OS (18.3

who received docetaxel every 3 weeks had a higher response rate but experienced
similar PFS and OS and a more pronounced toxicity. Cancer 2008;112:1455–61.

ocetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane, a class of anticancer agents
that has a novel mechanism of action in that its cellular target
is the b subunit of the tubulin heterodimer, which is the key component of microtubules.1,2 Drugs in this class bind to b-tubulin and
hyperstabilize the microtubules, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest
and subsequent apoptosis.1–3
Docetaxel was first approved for the treatment of anthracyclinerefractory locally advanced metastatic breast cancer (MBC), with
response rates ranging from 53% to 61%.4,5 Several phase 3 trials
confirmed the activity of docetaxel in the first-line treatment of and
in anthracycline-resistant MBC.6–10 Single-agent docetaxel and docetaxel-based regimens demonstrated clinical activity in stage II to III
breast cancer11–13 and were later approved for the adjuvant treatment of early high-risk breast cancer14 as well as other solid tumors,

including advanced nonsmall cell lung, gastric, and
hormone-refractory prostate cancers.6 The most
common toxic effect observed with the 3-week
administration of docetaxel was myelosuppression
and its complications, neutropenic fever and/or
infection.4–14 Other observed toxic effects have
included alopecia; gastrointestinal toxicity, manifested by brief and mild nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; rare acute anaphylactoid-type reaction
manifested by pruritus, flushing, and rash; and mild
to moderate cumulative fluid retention.4–14
In an attempt to alter the toxicity profile and
improve the therapeutic index of docetaxel, investigators conducted several phase 1 trials of docetaxel
administered by weekly schedule in patients with
advanced cancers, including breast cancer.15,16 These
trials demonstrated that the toxicity profile of docetaxel was markedly altered when administered
weekly. Fatigue and asthenia were the dose-limiting
toxicities, and myelosuppression was mild and
uncommon. Several phase 2 studies have described
the use of weekly docetaxel, with doses ranging from
30 to 45 mg/m2 for the treatment of patients with
MBC. The response rates ranged from 21% to 48%.17–19
The evidence of efficacy and the different toxicity
profiles observed with weekly docetaxel led us to
compare the 2 schedules, weekly versus every 3
weeks, to determine the safer schedule with the
higher efficacy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for our phase 3 clinical trial, patients
had to meet the following criteria: 1) patients had to
have histologic proof of breast cancer and evidence of
metastatic disease; 2) patients must not have received
>1 prior chemotherapy regimen for their metastatic
disease (prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy was
permitted but prior treatment with docetaxel was not,
and prior adjuvant paclitaxel was permitted if the last
dose had been taken at least 12 months previously);
3) patients must have had measurable disease, a life
expectancy of 12 weeks, and a performance status
score of 2 on the Zubrod scale20; and 4) patients
were required to have adequate bone marrow function, defined as an absolute granulocyte count of
1500/lL; a platelet count of 100,000/lL; adequate
renal function, defined as a serum creatinine concentration <2.0 mg/dL; and a total bilirubin level less
than the upper limit of normal.
Patients were not eligible for the study if they
had evidence of uncontrolled brain metastases or
other serious uncontrolled illnesses. All participants

signed an informed consent form as approved by the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board.

Treatment Plan
Before patients entered the study, a complete medical history was obtained and they underwent a physical examination that included an evaluation of
performance status and weight. Laboratory data
included a complete blood cell count, blood chemistry studies, and a serum pregnancy test in women of
childbearing potential.
Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel infused over 1 hour on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle
or docetaxel infused over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8,
and 15 of a 4-week cycle. For patients randomized to
the 3-week treatment arm, the starting dose of docetaxel in the first cycle was 75 mg/m2. If no grade 4
neutropenia lasting >7 days or associated with fever
or infection was observed, the dose for the second
cycle was increased to 100 mg/m2. For patients randomized to the weekly treatment arm, the starting
dose of docetaxel during the first 3 treatment cycles
was 35 mg/m2/week. If no grade 4 neutropenia, as
previously described, was observed, the dose for the
second cycle was increased to 40 mg/m2/week.
Doses for both treatment arms were escalated at the
discretion of the investigator. Before receiving each
dose, patients randomized to the 3-week treatment
arm were premedicated with dexamethasone at a
dose of 8 mg orally twice a day for 3 days, starting
the day before chemotherapy. Patients randomized
to the weekly treatment arm received a total of 3
doses of dexamethasone, each consisting of 4 mg
given orally every 12 hours, starting 12 hours before
each administration of docetaxel.
Toxic effects were graded using the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version
2.0). For grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxic effects,
treatment was withheld until the toxic effect resolved
to grade 1 and was then reinstituted at a 25% dose
reduction. If treatment was withheld for longer than
3 weeks because of a grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity, the patient was withdrawn from the study. A
maximum of 2 dose reductions of 25% was allowed
per patient. In case of an unacceptable hematologic
toxicity, the next treatment cycles were administered
at the same dose but with the addition of prophylactic granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor. Unacceptable hematologic toxicity was defined as grade 4
neutropenia lasting 7 days, repeatedly low daily
absolute neutrophil counts at 1000/mm3, grade 4
neutropenia associated with fever (1 oral temperature >38.58C or 3 oral temperatures of >38.08C in a

Docetaxel Schedules in Breast CA/Rivera et al.

24-hour period), or grade 4 neutropenia with infection.

Treatment Assessments
Within 7 days of their entry into the study and before
treatment randomization, the patients’ medical history was obtained and a physical examination performed; within 30 days before study entry a
radiologic evaluation was performed. Before receiving each dose of docetaxel, patients underwent a
complete blood cell count. Blood chemistry studies
were repeated before each treatment cycle. Radiologic assessments were performed after every 2 treatment cycles (6 or 8 weeks, depending on the
schedule) unless required sooner because of the clinical situation. After a response had been documented, a confirmatory study was obtained 4 weeks later.
Statistical Analyses
A maximum of 160 patients were to be accrued and
assigned treatment by a 1:1 randomization using a
permuted block design. The randomization was stratified by previous taxane use (yes or no) and the
number of previous chemotherapy regimens received
for metastatic disease (0 or 1). The primary outcome
was 2-dimensional and consisted of both response
(complete or partial) and toxicity. The historical
probabilities of these 2 events with the standard
schedule were presponse 5 .3 and ptoxicity 5 .2. The
goal of the trial was to improve both of these values
to presponse  .32 and ptoxicity  .10. Values of either
presponse  .20, a drop of  .10 below the null
response rate, or ptoxicity  .20, at or above the null
toxicity rate, were considered unacceptable.
In the comparison of toxicity rates, data from
160 patients would provide 80% power to detect an
absolute difference of 0.14, assuming that the higher
rate of toxicity is 0.20 (ie, severe toxicity rates of 6%
vs 20%) at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.
Accrual of 160 patients randomized on a 1:1 basis
between groups would provide 80% power to detect
this difference at a 1-sided significance level of 0.05,
assuming an overall response rate of 0.30. A recommendation for trial termination would be made only
for superiority of the weekly regimen in response
(1P < .005) and severe toxicity (2P < .001). The factors
duration of response, time to disease progression,
progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival
(OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Outcomes were compared using log-rank tests.
All patients who received at least 1 drug infusion
were analyzed for toxic effects. Nausea, vomiting,
and/or diarrhea that responded to symptom-directed
measures were excluded.

RESULTS
Between January 2001 and September 2004, 125
patients were enrolled in this study, with 62 patients
randomized to the every-3-week treatment arm and
63 patients randomized to the weekly treatment arm.
The patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Overall, the groups were well balanced.
The median number of delivered cycles was 9.5
cycles (range, 1–34 cycles) for the every-3-week treatment arm and 7 cycles (range, 1–43 cycles) for the

weekly arm. The median cumulative dose of docetaxel
was 609.5 mg/m2 (range, 75–2646 mg/m2) for the every-3-week treatment arm and 429.5 mg/m2 (range,
35–2975 mg/m2) for the weekly treatment arm. The
patients in the every-3-week treatment arm received a
median dose intensity of 25.65 mg/m2/week (range,
17.4–33.6 mg/m2/week), which reflects the finding that
most of these patients were able to receive the planned
dose of chemotherapy. Conversely, the patients in the
weekly treatment arm received a median dose intensity
of 27.65 mg/m2/week (range, 13.5–35 mg/m2/week), or
79% of the planned dose of chemotherapy. Ten patients
in the every-3-week treatment arm and 13 in the
weekly treatment arm were able to tolerate an escalated dose of docetaxel after their first cycle of chemotherapy. Another 10 patients in the every-3-week
treatment arm, but only 4 in the weekly treatment arm,
were able to tolerate an escalated dose of docetaxel after their second cycle of chemotherapy.
On the basis of efficacy and toxicity findings
from an interim analysis performed in June 2005 and
a slow accrual rate, the Data Monitoring Committee
recommended early termination of the trial.

Efficacy
Seven patients were found to be either ineligible or
not evaluable for both toxic effects and response,
none of whom received treatment in this study. Specifically, 2 patients did not meet the eligibility criteria, 2 decided to undergo treatment at an outside
institution, 1 decided to initiate hormonal therapy,
and 2 started a different chemotherapy regimen.
Thus, of the 118 patients eligible for an efficacy analysis, 59 were randomized to the every-3-week treatment arm and 59 to the weekly treatment arm.

The objective response rate was 35.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 23.6–49.1%) in the every-3week treatment arm compared with 20.3% (95% CI,
11.0–32.8%) in the weekly treatment arm. No complete responses were reported in either treatment
arm. Twenty-one partial responses were observed in
the every-3-week treatment arm and 12 in the weekly
treatment arm. Patients who did not achieve a partial
response were considered nonresponders. The difference in the objective response rates between both
treatment arms was 15.3% (95% CI, 23.4% to 33.5%).
The response duration was measured from the
date of response to the date of disease progression
or death. In the every-3-week treatment arm, 16 of
the 21 responders experienced either disease progression or death, with a median time to event of 7.9
months. In the weekly treatment arm, 10 of the 12
responders experienced either disease progression or
death, with a median time to event of 6.9 months.
The response duration was not found to be statistically different between the 2 groups (P 5 .87).
The median duration of follow-up was 15.1
months (range, 0.5–51.6 months). PFS was calculated
from the start of treatment to the date of disease
progression or death. PFS data are shown in Figure
1. In the every-3-week treatment arm, 50 patients
experienced either disease progression or death, with
a median time to event of 5.7 months. In the weekly
treatment arm, 55 patients experienced either disease
progression or death, with a median time to event of
5.5 months. PFS was not found to be statistically different between the 2 groups (P 5 .46).
OS time was calculated from the start of treatment to the date of death. OS is shown in Figure 2.
In the every-3-week treatment arm, 36 patients died,
with a median time to death of 18.3 months. In the

Docetaxel Schedules in Breast CA/Rivera et al.

weekly treatment arm, 39 patients died, with a median time to death of 18.6 months. OS was not found
to be statistically different between the 2 groups
(P 5 .34).

TABLE 2
Grade 3/4 Toxic Effects Reported*

Toxicity
The toxicity analysis included data from the 118
patients who received at least 1 drug infusion. Overall, 52 patients in the every-3-week treatment arm,
but only 33 in the weekly treatment arm, experienced
a serious toxic effect. The difference in the toxicity
rate between the 2 treatment arms was found to be
statistically significant, with a rate of 88.1% (95% CI,
77.1–95.1%) for the every-3-week treatment arm
compared with 55.9% (95% CI, 42.4–68.8%) for the
weekly treatment arm (P 5 .0001). A grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity level was observed more frequently in
the every-3-week treatment arm compared with the
weekly treatment arm. Granulocytopenia was
reported in 48 patients (81%) in the every-3-week
treatment arm compared with 6 patients (10%) in
the weekly treatment arm. Neutropenic fever was
also observed more commonly in the every-3-week
treatment arm (6 patients [10%]) compared with the
weekly treatment arm (2 patients [3%]). Serious nonhematologic toxicity was also more common in
patients with fatigue and myalgia in the every-3week treatment arm than in the weekly treatment
arm (15 [25%] vs 8 [14%], respectively, in patients
with fatigue and 16 [27%] vs 2 [3%], respectively, in
those with myalgia).
Although serious toxic effects were noted more
frequently in the every-3-week treatment arm compared with the weekly treatment arm, more toxic
effects were occasionally observed in the weekly
treatment arm. Among patients who developed grade
2 and 3 epiphora, for example, 11 patients (19%) and
3 patients (5%), respectively, were in the every-3week treatment arm compared with 14 patients
(24%) and 10 patients (17%), respectively, in the
weekly treatment arm. There were also fewer patients
who developed severe effusions in the every-3-week
treatment arm (2 patients [3%]) than in the weekly
treatment arm (7 patients [12%]). Additional details
regarding the grade 3/4 toxicity for each arm are
shown in Table 2.
Dose reductions secondary to treatment-related
toxicity were made in 7 patients (12%) in the every3-week treatment arm and in 15 (25%) in the weekly
treatment arm. One patient in the every-3-week
treatment arm had 2 dose reductions. The median
dose reduction for patients in the every-3-week treatment arm was 22.5% (range, 20–25%) compared with
15% (range, 12.5–25%) for those in the weekly

DISCUSSION
Docetaxel is active in the treatment of metastatic
and early-stage breast cancer. However, uncertainty
remains concerning the best schedule to use for its
administration. Recent reports of studies with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic and early breast
cancer suggest that activity is enhanced when it is
administered weekly rather than every 3 weeks.21,22
This could be in part because paclitaxel’s activity is
directly related to the cell cycle; therefore, more frequent or continuous administration would potentially result in higher efficacy. Conversely, docetaxel
is a schedule-independent drug. The current study
was specifically designed to determine the differences in the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel used
either every 3 weeks or weekly in patients with MBC.
To our knowledge, previous single-arm studies and 1
randomized phase 2 study have addressed this issue.
In the study by Tabernero et al.23 the population of
patients with MBC was similar to that in the current
study, with the primary endpoint being an evaluation
of drug activity and tolerability. Eighty-three patients
were randomized to receive 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel
every 3 weeks or 40 mg/m2 weekly for 6 consecutive
weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. That study
demonstrated no difference in response rates
between treatment arms, although the toxicity level
was greater with the every-3-week schedule compared with the weekly schedule.23 Their study was
smaller than the current one and used a different

1460

CANCER

weekly schedule and doses, which possibly
accounted for the lack of difference noted with
regard to efficacy in either treatment arm, in contrast
with the difference in efficacy we found. However,
the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events in both
treatment arms of that study was similar to that in
the current study (76% in the every-3-week treatment
arm and 49% in the weekly treatment arm23).
Di Maio et al.24 recently reported the meta-analysis of 5 small randomized studies comparing 3week versus weekly docetaxel as second-line therapy
in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
in whom a previous platinum-based regimen had
failed. The authors concluded that weekly docetaxel
demonstrated similar efficacy, including OS, compared with 3-week docetaxel. However, neutropenicrelated events were significantly lower for the weekly
docetaxel schedule. To the best of our knowledge,
the current study is the largest ever reported in MBC
patients to evaluate the use of docetaxel on an every3-week versus weekly schedule. Unlike the 2 previously reported studies, the current study demonstrated a significant difference in response rate in
favor of the every-3-week compared with the weekly
schedule. However, no significant differences in PFS
and OS were observed between study arms in any of
the reported studies. This may have been related to
the low number of patients enrolled in all 3 studies.
All of these studies, including the current one, are
significantly underpowered. Therefore, it is unknown
whether a larger study would have demonstrated an
improvement in OS for the 3-week treatment arms.
Conversely, a modest increase in response rate is
unlikely to impact OS in patients with advanced
MBC.
It is interesting to note that both studies found
significantly increased grade 3/4 toxicity with the every-3-week treatment schedule compared with the
weekly administration of docetaxel. Of more importance is that in all the studies, hematologic toxicity
was the most commonly observed grade 3/4 toxicity
and increased the risk of morbidity and mortality in
the every-3-week treatment arm. As demonstrated in
a previous report,25 docetaxel administered weekly
has a unique nonhematologic toxicity profile,
although it is associated more frequently with disabling epiphora and its anatomic correlate, canalicular stenosis, than when it is administered every 3
weeks.
These study results strongly suggest that the clinical benefit of docetaxel is not heavily dependent on
its schedule of administration. The clinical findings
from these studies correlate with the pharmacokinetics findings of an evaluation of the every-3-week

and the weekly treatment schedules. Baker et al.26
found no differences in the clearance or half-life of
docetaxel when it was administered at a dose of 100
mg/m2 every 3 weeks or at a dose of 35 mg/m2
weekly.
Sparano et al.27 recently reported the second
analysis of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) 1199, a phase 3 study of adjuvant weekly
versus 3-week paclitaxel or docetaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in patients with previously untreated stage II/III breast cancer.
Neutropenic-related events, fever, and/or infection
were found to be higher in the 3-week docetaxel
treatment arm. However, excessive tearing was
higher in the weekly treatment arm. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was numerically higher in the
3-week docetaxel treatment arm (81.2%) versus the
weekly treatment arm (77.6%). However, OS was similar in both arms.
In summary, the decision of which docetaxel
schedule to use in patients with MBC should be
based on the patient’s convenience and on the risk
of developing a specific docetaxel-related toxic effect.
In elderly patients or in those at risk of developing
neutropenic complications, for example, weekly docetaxel should be chosen. In addition, although the
response rate in our study favored the every-3-week
treatment schedule, the lack of survival benefit noted
between the 2 treatment arms and the lower toxicity
rate observed with the weekly dosing arm support
consideration of the weekly schedule for patients
about to begin docetaxel treatment for MBC.
