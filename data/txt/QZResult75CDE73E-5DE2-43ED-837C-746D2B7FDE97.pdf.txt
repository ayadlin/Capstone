Abstract
Activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in colorectal cancer
(CRC) is associated with enhanced tumor growth and a poorer
prognosis. In addition, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression
contributes to tumor growth and invasion. COX-2 inhibitors
exhibit important anticarcinogenic potential against CRC, but
the molecular mechanism underlying this effect and the
relation with RTK signaling remain the subject of intense
research effort. Therefore, the rapid effects of COX-2 inhibition
in CRC on the complement of all cellular kinases were
investigated using a kinase substrate peptide array, Western
blotting, transfection, small interfering RNA assays, and CRC
cell lines. The resulting alterations in the kinome profile
revealed that celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, impairs
phosphorylation of substrates for the RTKs c-Met and insulinlike growth factor receptor, resulting in decreased downstream
signaling. The decrease in c-Met activation is accompanied
with an increase in glycogen synthase kinase 3B kinase activity
together with a rapid increase in phosphorylation of B-catenin.
In agreement, a significant reduction of B-catenin-T-cell
factor–dependent transcription is observed both with celecoxib and selective inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation by
small molecules. Hence, corepression of c-Met–related and Bcatenin–related oncogenic signal transduction seems a major
effector of celecoxib in CRC, which provides a rationale to use
c-Met inhibitors and celecoxib analogous to target c-Met and
Wnt signaling in a therapeutic setting for patients with CRC.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancerrelated death worldwide despite recent advances in adjuvant
chemotherapeutic regimens. In the last decade, extensive research
has been made in the development of new therapeutic regimens for
CRC. Targeted therapy against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),
such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor, has been shown to improve
survival in patients with CRC (1, 2). In addition, a large amount of
data is available describing both clinically chemopreventive and
preclinically anticancer activities of selective cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

(NSAIDs; refs. 3–5). However, precise molecular mechanisms still
remain to be established.
The main event and the most characterized mechanism of
carcinogenesis in CRC is the disruption of a functional
adenopolyposis coli (APC) complex due to a mutation of the
APC gene or the b-catenin gene, leading to inappropriate
activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (6, 7). This results in
nuclear accumulation of h-catenin, which associates with the
T-cell factor (TCF)-4, leading to transcription of genes involved in
dedifferentiation, cell proliferation, and survival, events involved in
carcinogenesis. In addition, overexpression or activating mutations of RTKs, such as the EGFR, the insulin-like growth factor
receptor (IGFR), and c-Met, a receptor for hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF), contribute to the survival and progression of CRC
(8–11). c-Met is frequently overexpressed in advanced stages of
CRC and is correlated with a poor prognosis (12). c-Met activation
by HGF or by amplification results in cell dissociation, migration,
scattering, and invasion, important processes in cancer progression and metastasis (9–11, 13).
Evidence has emerged suggesting functional interaction
between COX-2 enzymatic activity, RTK signaling, and Wnt activity
(14–17). COX-2 activity enhances the cross-talk between the
membrane tyrosine kinases c-Met and EGFR, resulting in nuclear
accumulation of h-catenin; however, precise mechanisms remain
unclear (18). Previous studies have shown that relative high
concentrations of NSAIDs are able to down-regulate the Wnt
signaling cascade in colon cancer cells (19–22). Although c-Met
activation has been shown to enhance Wnt signaling in non–APCmutated, non-CRC cells, neither the relationship between c-Met
activation and its downstream signal transduction and Wnt
signaling nor the effect of COX-2 inhibition on c-Met signaling in
CRC has been clarified (23).
Because COX-2 has a crucial role in the carcinogenesis and
progression of CRC, exploration of its mechanisms can lead to
new therapeutic targets to improve survival of CRC. Celecoxib, a
selective COX-2 inhibitor, has been shown to posses the highest
anticarcinogenic capacity of NSAIDs and coxibs. Therefore, we have
explored the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib on
signal transduction in CRC cells. To this end, a peptide array was
used, which contains 1,176 different kinase substrate consensus
sequences, generating a comprehensive overview of the total
complement of cellular kinase activity and thus enabling analysis
of celecoxib effects without a priori assumptions as to signaling
pathways affected by the compound. The generated data have been
extensively validated (24–28). Our results suggest that celecoxib
represses c-Met–dependent signaling, resulting in down-regulation
of oncogenic Wnt signaling in CRC. These findings both stress the
importance of the tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met in carcinogenesis
and provide a rationale to target c-Met in therapeutic modalities.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Aspirin and NS398 were purchased from Sigma. Celecoxib
(pure reagent) was kindly provided by Pharmacia. Primary antibodies
against the following targets were used: phosphospecific h-catenin (Ser33/37/
Thr410), non-phospho-h-catenin, phospho-insulin receptor (INSR; Tyr1361),
phospho-EGFR (Tyr845), EGFR, phospho-c-Met (Ser1234/5), c-Met, phosphoGab-1 (Tyr6270), Gab-1, phospho-Akt (Ser473), Akt, phospho-Lck (Tyr505),
phospho-Src (Tyr527), phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h; Ser9),
GSK3h, phospho-PTEN (Ser380), and PTEN (Cell Signaling Technology).
Antibodies against c-Myc (9E10), anti-c-Met (c12), and h-actin (c19; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) were also used. LY294002 and small interfering RNA
(siRNA) GSK3a/h were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. A novel
small molecule inhibiting c-Met phosphorylation (PHA665752) was kindly
provided by Pfizer, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were all derived from DAKO.
Cell culture. Human colon cancer cell lines DLD1 (COX-2 negative) and
HT29 (COX-2 positive; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in
DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS (Integro), 5 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen Corp.) at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were passaged
20 times maximally. The concentration range of celecoxib in the experiment
was chosen to resemble the in vivo situation (5–50 Amol/L).
Cell viability in cell culture. The cell viability was assessed by
mitochondrial function, measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction activity. Briefly, cells were seeded
in a 14-well plate and stimulated with increasing concentrations of
celecoxib (5–50 Amol/L). After 48 h, 0.5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) was
added for 30 min at 37jC. Subsequently, the medium was aspirated and the
cells were lysed in isopropanol/0.04 mol/L HCl.
Kinome array analysis. A kinase substrate peptide array consisting of
1,176 peptides with specific phosphorylation sites was used to comprehensively evaluate the effects of aspirin and celecoxib on the kinome, as have
been previously described (24–26). After celecoxib treatment, the cells were
washed in ice-cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford analysis

(Bio-Rad). To study kinase activity, 50 AL of cell lysate (5 mg/mL protein)
were cleared on a 22-Am filter on ice, after which 10 AL of activation mix
were added, containing 50% glycerol, 50 Amol/L ATP, 60 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.05% (v/v) Brij-35, 0.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 2,000 ACi/mL
[g-33P]ATP. The resulting samples were incubated on the PepChip arrays
(Pepscan) containing 1,176 kinase substrate peptides in duplicate for 2 h in a
humidified stove at 37jC. Subsequently, the arrays were washed in 2 mol/L
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and H2O, after which slides were
dried and exposed to a phosphoimaging screen for 24 h. Experiments were
performed in duplicate and repeated independently (n = 3). The robustness
of this array technology was confirmed by repeating each experiment (each
time with a different print run of the array) and by using different dilutions of
the same lysate and different exposure times to ensure that spots were
analyzed in the linear range of the enzymatic kinase reaction.
Data acquisition and statistical analysis. Imaging of the incorporated
[g-33P]ATP was performed using a phosphoimager (Fuji) at 50 Am/pixel.
Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences 11.5 (SPSS, Inc.). After image acquisition and
quantification using ArrayVision software 6.0 (Molecular Dynamics), each
spot was corrected for its individual background. To reduce variation
induced by incubation and imaging conditions, the data of each array were
corrected with a linear trimmed median normalization method for each
array and each individual experiment. After excluding inappropriate
duplicates for further analysis, the resulting data matrix consisted of the
phosphorylation levels of 1,176 peptides induced by the HT29 lysate treated
with celecoxib relative to the control. To identify biologically relevant
activity changes, we calculated the differences in variance relative to the
regression curve (SD > 1.96). Data were considered relevant for analysis
when the signal to noise ratio in both conditions was >1.8 and a z1.7 fold
change was observed in both conditions.
Transfection and luciferase activity assays. The HT29 and DLD1 colon
carcinoma cells were transiently transfected with Renilla constructs and
5 Ag of either TOPflash or FOPflash TCF reporter constructs (Upstate
Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Five
hours after transfection, complete culture medium was added and the cells
were stimulated. Forty-eight hours after stimulation, cells were lysed in lysis
buffer (Luciferase Assay System, Promega), and 20 AL of each lysate were

monitored for luciferase activity using luciferase assay substrate buffer
(Promega). Light units were recorded using a luminometer. Transfection
efficiency was determined by cotransfection with the Renilla luciferase
reporter vector pRL-CMV (Promega). The resulting transfection efficiency
was used to correct for differences in transfection in each culture well in
each experiment. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated
independently thrice.
Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of lysates of HT29 and DLD1 cells
were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were
blocked with TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer) and 1%
casein. Primary antibody incubation was done overnight at 4jC, diluted
1:1,500 in blocking buffer. Subsequently, the membranes were washed and
incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO) diluted in
blocking buffer. The bands were visualized using Lumilight Plus substrate
(Roche) and chemiluminescence detection by a Lumi-Imager (Roche). Each
sample was corrected for loading by comparison with the appropriate
h-actin signal.
Small interfering RNA transfection. SignalSilence GSK3 siRNA kit (Cell
Signaling Technology) was used to down-regulate GSK3a/h protein in CRC
cell lines. In brief, HT29 cells were transfected with siRNA ( final
concentration of 100 nmol/L) using transfection reagent (Cell Signaling
Technology). After 12 h, the cells were treated with celecoxib. After 2 days,
cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. Control cells
were transfected with nonspecific siRNA and cultured under the identical
conditions.

Results
The effects of celecoxib on viability of CRC cell lines. Before
embarking on peptide array analysis of celecoxib effects on cellular
physiology, we decided to first characterize the effects of NSAID
treatment on cell proliferation and survival in our model system
using a MTT assay. Celecoxib potently reduced mitochondrial
activity on 72 h of incubation, which was observed in both HT29
cells (COX-2 positive) and DLD1 cells (COX-2 negative), whereas
the administration of aspirin or NS398, another selective COX-2
inhibitor, had little effect (Fig. 1A). This supports the well-described
phenomenon that the anticancer activity of celecoxib is more
potent than other NSAIDs and is COX-2 independent (3).
Interestingly, it was noted that the effects of celecoxib on cellular

www.aacrjournals.org

viability were dependent on the amount of FCS present in the
medium. Higher amounts of FCS reduced the celecoxib-induced
reduction in mitochondrial activity significantly (Fig. 1B). We
concluded that our experimental setup was valid for investigating
celecoxib-specific effects on CRC cell physiology.
Analysis of kinome alterations on aspirin and celecoxib
administration in HT29 cells. Because almost all cellular
biochemical pathways are under strict control of reversible
phosphorylation of rate-limiting enzymes, we assumed that the
effects of celecoxib would be reflected in altered activity of cellular
kinases. Therefore, we have examined the effects of celecoxib on
rapid signal transduction in cell lysates of HT29 cells after shortterm treatment with 25 Amol/L celecoxib using a peptide array
containing 1,176 different, spatially addressed oligopeptide kinase
substrates in duplex as described (24–26). After in vitro phosphorylation of the peptide substrates by kinase activities in cell lysates
and [g-33P]ATP and substrate phosphorylation quantification, the
Spearman’s correlation between independently performed experiments was always in excess of 0.85. Therefore, the data were
considered as valid for analysis of the celecoxib-induced effects on
CRC cell kinase activity (n = 3). Thirty minutes of celecoxib
treatment resulted in significant changes in the cellular phosphorylation patterns of HT29 cells, reflecting the potent effects of
celecoxib on CRC cellular signal transduction (Fig. 2). Table 1
provides the top 20 affected substrates. Strikingly, a celecoxibdependent, significant decrease in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)-associated signal transduction, including reduced phosphorylation of substrates for IGFR/c-Met, protein kinase C~ (PKC~), and
Akt. In agreement, a concomitant increase in phosphorylation of a
substrate for GSK3h was apparent after celecoxib treatment. Taken
together, the peptide array analysis suggests that celecoxib acts on
growth factor–related signal transduction by inhibition of IGFRinduced and c-Met–induced kinase activity.
Dephosphorylation of c-Met on the Y1234 autophosphorylation site is induced by celecoxib in HT29 CRC cells. The results
of the peptide array indicate that celecoxib inhibits IGFR and c-Met
autophosphorylation followed by diminished activation of kinases
downstream in the PI3K signaling pathway (Table 1). To confirm

this observations, short-term (30 min) incubation experiments
were performed in HT29 cells and phosphorylation levels were
evaluated by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 3A). In agreement with the peptide array analysis,
celecoxib completely eliminated c-Met Y1234/5 autophosphorylation
within a 30-min time frame. As the peptide substrate used in the
array does not distinguish well between the c-Met receptor and
INSR, the autophosphorylation status of the INSR was investigated,
providing functional validation. Only a minor decrease in INSR
autophosphorylation was observed (possibly the result of crossreactivity of the INSR antibody with pY1234/5 c-Met; data not
shown). The EGFR phosphorylation was not affected. Important
regulating kinases involved in other pathways, such as Src and Lck,
were altered in activation, as shown by their phosphorylation
status. Moreover, the activity of PTEN, the phosphatase regulating
the PI3K signal transduction, was not changed (Fig. 3A) on
celecoxib administration, indicating a direct and specific effect on
c-Met and validating the results of the peptide array.
Kinetic analysis of celecoxib action on impaired c-Met Y1234/5
autophosphorylation showed that, already after 2 min after
celecoxib treatment, a markedly reduced autophosphorylation is
evident (Fig. 3B). In addition, a concentration-dependent decrease
of phospho-c-Met by celecoxib was observed (Fig. 3C). This effect
of celecoxib on c-Met autophosphorylation was corroborated by
experiments in which we directly addressed the phosphorylation
status of the adaptor protein Gab-1, which is activated on c-Met
activation, enabling signal transduction to multiple pathways.
Figure 3A and B shows that Gab-1 Y307 phosphorylation was
rapidly down-regulated by celecoxib with kinetics closely resembling the effects observed on c-Met autophosphorylation. In c-Met,
signal transduction phosphorylation of Gab-1 in turn produces
stimulation of the PI3K pathway followed by Akt phosphorylation
(29). In agreement with the observed celecoxib-induced blockage of
constitutive c-Met RTK activity and also with the reduced
phosphorylation of an Akt-specific substrate on the peptide array
following celecoxib treatment, Akt phosphorylation was substantially reduced following celecoxib treatment when assayed on
Western blot (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the increase in GSK3h activity as
shown in the peptide array experiment corresponded a decrease of
GSK3h phosphorylation of the Akt target S9 in GSK3h on celecoxib
treatment, an event associated with decreased activity of this
enzyme (30).

COX-2 Inhibition Inhibits c-Met Kinase and Wnt Activity

Together, these results show that the findings of the peptide
array correspond with those of conventional techniques. Selective
COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib efficiently down-regulates c-Met
receptor activity, resulting in both decreased activity of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases and PI3K
pathway, the latter evident from decreased Akt and GSK3h
phosphorylation. These results also strongly suggest that the
celecoxib-induced inhibition of c-Met–dependent signaling
decreases the level of Wnt activity in colon cancer cells because
the levels of phospho-h-catenin are increased on celecoxib
administration.
Wnt signaling is decreased by celecoxib. The results
described above suggest that c-Met activation by phosphorylation
is a relevant target for celecoxib with respect to CRC cell
cytotoxicity but leave the mechanism by which diminished c-Met
activation may have an anticancer effect unexplored. As it is well
established that activity of the Wnt pathway is critical factor for
CRC cell survival and proliferation, the effects of celecoxib on the
activity of this pathway were determined. The major defect in the
regulation of the Wnt pathway in APC-mutant cells is the decrease
in levels of phospho-h-catenin, causing diminished breakdown of
h-catenin by the proteosome and subsequent increased nuclear

translocation of the protein. Interestingly, celecoxib-induced c-Met
dephosphorylation was followed by a substantial increase of the
levels of phospho-h-catenin (Fig. 3C). Because phosphorylation of
h-catenin enables breakdown of the protein and thus to a decrease
of TCF-h-catenin–dependent transcription, the effect of celecoxib
on the transcription activity of TCF-h-catenin was explored.
Therefore, DLD1 and HT29 cells were transfected with a specific
TCF reporter (TOP) construct and corrected results for cell death
using a constitutive Renilla firefly construct as well as by using a
construct containing a scrambled TCF-responsive motif (FOP).
Following celecoxib treatment for 36 h, h-catenin/TCF–activated
TOPflash activity was abrogated in both DLD1 and HT29 cells
(Fig. 4A). The inhibition of TCF-mediated transcription was
observed after treatment of relative low concentrations
(12.5 Amol/L) of celecoxib by HT29 cells, whereas 25 Amol/L was
needed in DLD1 cells.
This indicates a specific effect of celecoxib on the TCFmediated transcription in both HT29 and DLD1 cell lines, which
coincides with the increase in h-catenin phosphorylation. In
agreement, a dose-dependent, celecoxib-induced down-regulation
of the established Wnt targets, Myc and cyclin D1, was observed on
protein levels (Fig. 4B). Thus, the inhibition of c-Met signaling by

kinomic analysis and identifies Met and
downstream Akt, GSK3, as a target for
COX-2 inhibition. A, Western blot analysis
with phosphospecific antibodies of HT29
cells incubated with celecoxib or control for
30 min confirms the results of the peptide
array. B, kinetic analysis of celecoxib

transfected with scrambled siRNA as a
control (right three lanes ). When
transfected with siRNA, GSK3h is still
present but, after 36 h, in less quantity.

cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. These results show that
GSK3h is functionally active and necessary to induce phosphorylation of h-catenin in these cells. In addition, treatment with LiCl,
an inhibitor of GSK3h, did result in similar decreased h-catenin
phosphorylation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3D, celecoxib
did not induce h-catenin phosphorylation in combination with
GSK3h siRNA. This confirms that GSK3h mediates the phosphorylation of h-catenin and suggests that the effects of celecoxib on
h-catenin/TCF–dependent transcription are mediated upstream of
GSK3h.
c-Met activation enhances Wnt signaling in colon cancer
cell lines. To determine whether HGF was able to stimulate TCF
transcription, by stimulating c-Met, HT29 cells were transfected
with a TCF reporter vector, TOPflash, which contains a
combination of TCF-binding elements. Exposure to HGF increased
the transcriptional activity of TOPflash f10-fold (Fig. 5). As a
positive control, cotransfection with a LEF-1 expression vector
increased the activity of TOPflash f40-fold. In contrast, the
reporter construct containing mutated TCF sites, FOPflash, had
very low activity in HT29 cells; treatment with HGF did not
significantly increase luciferase activity of this construct. To
investigate the effect of endogenous HGF on TCF activity, we
treated HT29 cells with PHA665752, a selective c-Met kinase
inhibitor. Previous studies have shown that the PHA665752 is

celecoxib coincides with reduced activity of Wnt/h-catenin
pathway.
Celecoxib induces decreased activity of GSK3B resulting in
increased phospho-B-catenin. The observed increase in the
phosphorylation of h-catenin together with decreased phosphorylation of both Akt and one of its downstream targets, GSK3h,
suggest that the GSK3h enzyme has remaining functional activity
to the phosphorylation of h-catenin in cell lines with an APC
mutation. To investigate whether GSK3h is essential for the
observed increase in phosphorylation of h-catenin on COX-2
inhibition, despite the presence of the APC mutation, HT29 cells
were transfected with siRNA against GSK3h and subsequently
treated with celecoxib for 30 min. In Fig. 3D, it is shown that
celecoxib treatment did not result in increased h-catenin phosphorylation in cells transfected with GSK3h siRNA compared with

specific for c-Met, not blocking other kinases. It is shown that the
addition of PHA665752 in the presence of HGF completely
abrogated the effect of HGF on TCF transcriptional activity,
thereby confirming that the HGF-induced effect is specific and acts
by activation of c-Met.

Discussion
Although the antagonistic effect of COX-2 inhibitors on the
mortality from CRC is undisputed, the nature of the underlying
molecular mechanism remains unestablished. In the present study,
we have aimed to clarify this issue by investigating the effects of
celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor with both preventive and therapeutic
properties, on phosphoregulated signal transduction in CRC cells
without a priori assumptions as to the kinase pathways affected by
the treatment. To this end, we used a relatively novel peptide array
approach investigating multiple kinase activities in parallel in
combination with conventional techniques to validate the findings
and to translate kinase activity to mechanisms in CRC. The results
obtained suggested that celecoxib targets c-Met autophosphorylation, resulting in impaired downstream activity of the Gab/PI3K
pathway.
The identification of c-Met autophosphorylation and subsequent
signaling through the PI3K pathway as a target for celecoxib was
unexpected but makes sense as viewed from the body of currently
available literature. The expression of c-Met is an important
prognostic factor for CRC progression and metastasis (12, 31, 32).
Similar results are found for other adenomatous cancer types.
Furthermore, PI3K activity is a well-known phenomenon in CRC
and literature is available showing that celecoxib treatment reduces
activity of this pathway (33). The results presented in the current
study suggest that activity of this pathway is partly driven by the
basal c-Met activity. We have previously shown that c-Met
expression can be regulated by the Wnt pathway, whereas also
data have been presented that activation of c-Met results in
enhanced activity of the Wnt pathway (12, 23, 32). Thus, a positive
feedback between activation of the pathway on one hand and
activity of c-Met signaling on the other hand seems to exist. This
notion is reinforced by our observation that celecoxib treatment
resulted in a rapid reduction of c-Met phosphorylation and
subsequent downstream signaling through both ERK and Akt and
GSK3h. This decrease is followed by a diminished transcriptional
activity of the Wnt pathway as assessed by the TOP/FOP assay and
expression levels of established Wnt targets as well as by the
stimulation of h-catenin phosphorylation in celecoxib-treated cells.
Although we have shown that presence of GSK3h is essential for the
celecoxib-induced phosphorylation of h-catenin, these findings are
in disparity with the presence of APC mutations in these cells,
which are generally assumed to abolish the capacity of GSK3h to
interact and thus phosphorylate h-catenin (34). However, recently,
Li et al. (35) showed that GSK3h is still capable of regulating
phosphorylation of h-catenin despite the presence of an APC
mutation in CRC cells, supporting our findings. In mammary

epithelial cells with a functional APC complex, HGF-dependent
inhibition of GSK3h activity results in diminished phosphorylation
of h-catenin and increased nuclear accumulation of the protein
(36). In our study, we observed an increased GSK3h activity
following celecoxib treatment in the peptide array experiments.
These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis showing that
celecoxib diminishes phosphorylation of GSK3h S9, an event
associated with increased GSK3h activity (37). Thus, it is possible
that also in CRC cells harboring APC mutation increased GSK3h
activity mediates the increase of h-catenin phosphorylation and
subsequent decreased transcriptional activity of the Wnt pathway.
Hence, a possible interpretation of the present study is that
inhibition of c-Met autophosphorylation followed by reduced c-Met
activation contributes to celecoxib-dependent growth reduction
and cytotoxicity in CRC cells.
To translate the results shown in vitro, we have chosen celecoxib
concentration that can be achieved in vivo as shown in serum from
patients (38). Furthermore, we have previously shown in a clinical
phase 2 trial in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma that both
COX-2 and Met expression in cancer tissue, both highly expressed in
esophageal adenocarcinoma, were down-regulated after 4 weeks of
celecoxib treatment (17). A phase 2 trial in which patients with CRC
have been treated with celecoxib neoadjuvantly is currently under
investigation to show molecular effects in tumor tissue in vivo.
The mechanism by which celecoxib influences c-Met autophosphorylation remains unclear as the effect of celecoxib is overcome
by high concentrations of HGF. Diminished prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) production by inhibition of the COX-2 activity may be
implicated. Indeed, PGE2 enhances activation of c-Met, possibly via
activation of prostanoid receptors, in turn cross-linking growth
factor receptors and subsequent downstream signal transduction
(18, 36). The observation that HGF is capable of inducing Wnt
signaling, which can be reversed on c-Met inhibition, provides
evidence that c-Met inhibition is essential for the effects described
in this study regardless of PGE2.
The present study shows that corepression or c-Met and hcatenin oncogenic signal transduction is a major effector of
celecoxib-induced effects in CRC cells. Despite the negative reports
showing an increased cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors,
which indeed negates the use of COX-2 inhibitors for CRC
prevention, celecoxib administration as (neo-) adjuvant therapy
or in combination with other drugs for advanced disease could be
of therapeutic benefit for patients with CRC. The importance of
c-Met as a target for selective therapy in patients with CRC will
need further clinical investigation.
