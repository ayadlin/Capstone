ABSTRACT:
Neurofibromin regulates cell motility via three distinct GTPase pathways acting
through two different domains, the Ras GTPase-activating protein-related domain
(GRD) and the pre-GRD domain. First, the GRD domain inhibits Ras-dependent changes
in cell motility through the mitogen activated protein cascade. Second, it also regulates
Rho-dependent (Ras-independent) changes by activating LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2), an
enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin (an actin-depolymerizing factor).
Third, the pre-GRD domain acts through the Rac1 GTPase, that activate the P21
activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-LIMK1-cofilin pathway. We employed molecular modeling
to identify a novel inhibitor of LIMK1/2. The active sites of an ephrin-A receptor
(EphA3) and LIMK2 showed marked similarity (60%). On testing a known inhibitor
of EphA3, we found that it fits to the LIMK1/2-ATP binding site and to the latter’s
substrate-binding pockets. We identified a similar compound, T56-LIMKi, and found
that it inhibits LIMK1/2 kinase activities. It blocked the phosphorylation of cofilin
which led to actin severance and inhibition of tumor cell migration, tumor cell growth,
and anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar. Because modulation of
LIMK by neurofibromin is not affected by the Ras inhibitor Salirasib, we examined the
combined effect of Salirasib and T56-LIMKi each of which can affect cell motility by a
distinct pathway. We found that their combined action on cell proliferation and stressfiber formation in neurofibromin-deficient cells was synergistic. We suggest that this
drug combination may be developed for treatment of neurofibromatosis and cancer.

INTRODUCTION

of actin filaments and participates in numerous cellular
functions, such as cell migration, cell cycle processes,
and neuronal differentiation[6, 7]. In its phosphorylated
state cofilin is inactive and does not affect the cell
cytoskeleton. Hyperphosphorylation of cofilin typically
occurs in many human diseases and pathological
conditions, such as cancer cell invasion and metastasis[8],

The
actin-depolymerizing
factor
(ADF)/
cofilin family of proteins plays a prominent role in
promoting actin depolymerization [1, 2]. Cofilin is
phosphorylated mainly by LIMK1 and LIMK2[3-5].

as well as in neurodevelopmental disorders, for example
Williams syndrome [9]. LIMKs are important targets in
drug development because their inhibition will induce
an increase in the levels of the unphosphorylated active
cofilin.
Activation of LIMKs is regulated by the Rho
GTPase family of proteins; LIMK2 is activated by
the Rho GTPase pathway and LIMK1 by the Rac-1
GTPase pathway [5, 10](see Fig. 1). Recent studies have
shown that p-cofilin levels are high in cells deficient in
neurofibromin (NF1-/- cells). These cells present relatively
high levels of stress fibers [2, 11]. Neurofibromin 1, the
NF1 gene product, is a 2818-amino acid protein [12-14]
containing four domains: a cysteine/serine-rich domain
(CSRD), a functional Ras GTPase-activating protein
(GAP)-related domain (GRD) that follows the pre-GRD
domain, a leucine repeat domain, and a C-terminal domain
(CTD) (see Fig. 1). The best characterized of the four
is the GRD domain, which facilitates GTP hydrolysis
by Ras, and exerts the major tumor-suppressor activity
through its ability to downregulate the active Ras protooncogene and its pathways [13, 14]. The relatively high
levels of active Ras.GTP that occur in NF1 deficient cells
contribute to neurofibromatosis and to cancer in NF1‑/-

patients [15]. Our group has previously shown that the
high Ras.GTP phenotype of neurofibromin-deficient cells
can partially be corrected by the Ras inhibitor S-trans,
trans-farnesylthiosalicyclic acid (FTS; Salirasib), and that
such treatment leads to the inhibition of Ras downstream
effectors including MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and Ral guanine
nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS). This
inhibition leads in turn to reduced proliferation of NF1/cells and tumors [16].
The GRD of nuerofibromin is known to enhance
cell motility by regulating actin-filament dynamics via
the Rho-ROCK-LIMK2-cofilin pathway (see Fig. 1) [1,
2, 17]. NF1 siRNA indeed shows elevated levels of Rho.
GTP, increased cofilin phosphorylation and decrease
in stress-fiber formation. However, dominant-negative
Ras, which itself acts upstream of Rho as well as ROCK
inhibitors, suppress only partially the increased p-cofilin
levels NF-/- cells. In addition, Rho activation through
the GRD does not involve the classic Ras downstream
pathways [2]. Those results suggested that NF1-/- cell
motility is controlled by additional pathways.
Recently we showed that Ras inhibition by FTS
in NF1-/- cells inhibits their motility and spreading,
alters gene expression, and eliminates the expression

The GRD domain inhibits the Ras-dependent pathway, which controls Raf-MEK-Erk-dependent gene expression and the motility and
spreading of NF1-/- cells. The GRD domain also inhibits a Rho-dependent pathway which activates LIMK2[2, 18]. The pre-GRD domain
inhibits the Ras-independent Rac1-activation pathway, which regulates LIMK1[11]. LIMKs are widely expressed in a variety of tissues
and play a critical role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. LIMKs phosphorylate cofilin, rendering it inactive and unable to bind and
sever actin filaments.

of regulators of cell–matrix interaction[16]. These
phenomena are indicative of a phenotypic reversion
of NF1-deficient cells by FTS through inhibition of the
BMP4 and TGF-β pathways [18]. Those relationships are
directly related to the lack of GRD in the NF1-deficient
cells [16]. However, re-expression of the entire GRD of
NF1 results in only partial restoration of the excessive
formation of stress fibers in neurofibromin-deficient HeLa
and human fibrosarcoma cells, consistent with the notion
that an additional NF1 domain or domains contribute to
cytoskeleton reorganization [2].
The functional attributes of most of the
neurofibromin domains other than the GRD are less well
characterized than those of the GRD. Recent data support
a specific role for a non-GRD domain, suggesting a Rasindependent function of NF1[3, 11]. We recently examined
the possibility that the pre-GRD, N-terminal domain of
neurofibromin has a regulatory function associated with
remodeling of the cytoskeleton [11]. This hypothesis is
supported by the non-GRD control over the cytoskeleton
mentioned above, as well as by the marked evolutionary
conservation of this domain. Furthermore, many missense
pathogenic mutations in this domain are found in

neurofibromatosis patients, suggesting that such mutations
are associated with the disease, independently of the GRD
[19].
We found that NF1 1-1162, the pre-GRD region
of neurofibromin indeed alters the expression of genes
that participate in cell adhesion and migration, and
acts as a negative regulator of the Rac1/Pak1/LIMK1/
cofilin pathway [5, 11, 17], a pathway highly involved in
cancer [10, 20, 21] (see scheme in Fig. 1). Accordingly,
in neurofibromin-deficient glioblastoma and mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the levels of Rac1-GTP,
p-Pak1, p-LIMK1 and p-cofilin are relatively high,
whereas expression of the NF1 1-1163 polypeptide leads
to a significant decrease in each of these active signaling
enzymes [11]. Concomitantly, upon expression of the
NF1 1-1163 polypeptide, actin stress fibers and focal
adhesion are disassembled and cell migration is halted
in neurofibromin-deficient cells [11]. These effects are
independent of Ras signaling pathways. Thus, NF1
1-1163, through its negative regulation of Rac-1, shifts
the balance from inactive to more active cofilin, resulting
in the severing of F-actin and a decrease in actin stress
fibers [11].
Altogether, these studies pointed to the possibility
that neurofibromin is a participant not only in a Rasdependent mechanism but also in a Ras-independent
mechanism that regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Loss
of neurofibromin would affect both pathways (Fig. 1).
The newly discovered functions of NF1 [11] might be of
clinical relevance for understanding the invasiveness and
tumor progression of NF1-associated tumors and for drug
development. In particular, it seems reasonable to target
the LIMKs for cancer therapy [3]. Accordingly, based on
the results of bioinformatics computational modeling, we
have designed and prepared a new LIMK inhibitor.

RESULTS
Analysis of LIMK1/2 structures.
The LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) are dual
specificity (serine/threonine and tyrosine) kinases that
share 70% structural similarity in their kinase domain (3,
20).
We wanted to design an inhibitor of LIMK2 that
is controlled by the best characterized NF1 domain, the
GRD, which inhibits the Rho-ROCK-LIMK2- cofilin
pathway (see Fig. 1). LIMK2 consists of two LIM
domains, a PDZ domain, a proline/serine-rich region
and a protein kinase domain. The LIM domains play an
important role in regulating kinase activity [22] and their
structure was solved by NMR (PDB ID: 1X6A). The PDZ
domain influences nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling [23], and
its structure was also solved by NMR (PDB ID: 2YUB).

the Protein BLAST [26] and I-TASSER[27] webservers.
The first homologous structure we identified was the
recently solved LIMK1 (PDB ID: 3S95), which has the
best sequence identity with the kinase domain of LIMK2
(64% sequence identity). LIMK1 was crystallized together
with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor staurosporine. This
inhibitor competes with high activity but low selectivity
with ATP on binding sites of many kinases, and therefore
staurosporine inhibition was not examined further.
The second LIMK homologue we identified was
found, surprisingly, to be the human EphA3 kinase
receptor (31% sequence identity with LIMK2). One of the
PDB structures of EphA3 kinase (PDB ID: 3DZQ) was
crystallized with an inhibitor termed AWL-II-38.3, which
is bound in the substrate-binding pocket of the EphA3
(formula: N-(2-methyl-5-({(3-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)carbonyl} amino)phenyl)
isoxazole-5-carboxamide). We applied MODELLER [28]
to model the structure of the kinase domain of LIMK2
using the EphA3 kinase structure as a template and
compared the inhibitor-binding sites of the two proteins.
The binding site was highly conserved between EphA3
and LIMK2, suggesting to us that the EphA3 inhibitor
might also inhibit LIMK2. Comparison between the
binding sites of EphA3 and LIMK1 disclosed lower
conservation, which might reflect a lower affinity of the
inhibitor for LIMK1 than for LIMK2 (Fig. 2 A).

Bioinformatic identification of a LIMK inhibitor.
The first LIMK inhibitor to be discovered was
N-{5-(2-(2,6-dichloro-phenyl)-5-difluoromethyl-2Hpyrazol-3-yl)-thiazol-2-yl}-isobutyramide (compound
3 in Ross-Macdonald, 2008, hereafter referred to as
BMS-5) [24]. It was found by screening a synthetic
series of more than 400 phenyl-substituted pyrimidines
[25]. BMS-5 inhibits both LIMK1 and LIMK 2 [24]. In
the present study we attempted to identify an inhibitor
of LIMK2 by another method. Using bioinformatic
analysis to search for proteins homologous to LIMK,
we identified a protein (the kinase receptor EphA3) that
exhibits 31% sequence identity with it, and has a solved
crystal structure, including an inhibitor, which blocks its
active site. Moreover, modeling of the LIMK2 sequence
on the EphA3 structure as a template revealed marked
conservation of the binding-site residues.
We searched for proteins homologous to LIMK
in solved structures deposited in the PDB and by using

compound we identified as a potential LIMK2 inhibitor
occupies both the ATP-binding and the substrate-binding
sites. This might provide enhanced affinity and selectivity
toward LIMK2.
The binding sites of EphA3 and LIMK1 are less
well conserved. The aromatic and bulky Phe632 of EphA3
is replaced by Gly346 in LIMK1, and Ile697 of EphA3 is
replaced by Phe411 of LIMK1. These differences might
change the shape of the binding site and reduce the affinity
of the inhibitor for LIMK1 (see Fig. 2 A).
Using the ZINC database [30] we searched for
commercially available compounds that are similar to the
EphA3 inhibitor AWL-II-38.3. One of the compounds that
most closely resembled it was T56-LIMKi. The stuctures
of the two compounds are depicted in Figure 2, panel C.
Upon careful analysis of the modeled LIMK2 binding site,
it appeared that two additional commercially available
compounds might fit into the active site of LIMK2
(MolPort-006-847-897 and MolPort-005-968-461, not
shown). We next examined the effect of the T56-LIMKi
compound on LIMK phosphorylation of its known
substrate, cofilin, the major substrate of the LIMKs in the
cells.

Comparison between the inhibitor-binding sites in
EphA3 and the LIMK2 model (Fig. 2B) revealed very
high conservation. Of the 20 amino acids in the binding
sites, 13 showed sequence identity (65%), 6 had a different
residue but the same hydrophobic property (Ala, Val, Ile
and Met), and in only one amino acid (S135A) the residue
differed, causing LIMK2 to lose a hydrogen bond with
the inhibitor (Table 1 and Fig. 2). This high conservation
supported our contention that the EphA3 inhibitor, or a
similar compound, is likely to inhibit LIMK2. Our model
suggested that—unlike other common kinase inhibitors
which compete for the ATP binding site [29]—the

T56-LIMKi reduces phosphorylated
(p-cofilin) in NF1-/- MEFs.

Having previously shown that p-cofilin levels are
high in NF1-/- MEFs [11], we used these cells to examine
the impact of T56-LIMKi on phosphorylation of the
LIMK substrate cofilin. We assumed that if LIMK is
inhibited by T56-LIMKi, the amount of p-cofilin in the
cells will be reduced by the inhibitor. NF1-/- MEFs were
serum starved for 24 hours and then incubated for 2
hours with different concentrations of T56-LIMKi. The
cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with
anti-p-cofilin, anti-cofilin, and anti-β-tubulin (loading
control) antibodies (Fig. 3). We found that T56-LIMKi
(10-50 μM) reduced p-cofilin in a dose-dependent manner.
Notably, the inhibitor did not affect the amounts of total
cofilin (Fig. 3). These results strongly suggested that
T56-LIMKi inhibited LIMK, as predicted by our model
(Fig. 2). A similar experiment performed with the LIMK
inhibitor BMS-5 yielded comparable results, except that
this inhibitor was more potent than T56-LIMKi (Fig. 3).
Nonetheless these findings, taken together, strengthened
the conclusion that the bioinformatic modeling procedure
had predicted a novel LIMK inhibitor. These results did
not distinguish, however, between the possible inhibition
of LIMK 2, LIMK 1, or both by T56-LIMKi.
Next, we examined the impact of the new LIMK
inhibitor on the growth of NF1-/- MEFs. The cells were
plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per
well. Treatment of the cells with different concentrations
of T56-LIMKi resulted in a dose-dependent decrease

the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% FCS and
the indicated amount of T56-LIMKi. After further incubation

μM ± 5.3 (n = 9). We also examined the effects of the
Ras inhibitor FTS on cell proliferation, alone and in
combination with T56-LIMKi. Growth inhibition by 5
μM T56-LIMKi in the absence of FTS was only 13% ±

4.9%, but was much stronger in its presence (60% ± 2.5%;
Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with 25 μM T56LIMKi (growth inhibition was 51% ± 2.3% in the absence
of FTS and 85.5% ± 1.1% in its presence; Fig. 4). Because
FTS alone caused growth inhibition of only 33% ± 1.6%

(Fig. 4; zero T56-LIMKi), it seemed that the combination
inhibited the growth of the NF-/- cells synergistically.
According to the Loewe additivity synergistic calculation

statistically significant reduction in the number of cells
exhibiting stress fibers (a decrease of 26% ± 7.7%; n =
300 cells; P < 0.05; Fig. 5).
Note that only 30% inhibition was obtained by the
relatively high concentration of T56-LIMKi (50 μM) that
inhibited 70% of cell proliferation (Fig. 4) and inhibited
about 50% of cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK (Fig. 3).
These results appear to support the notion that some of
the LIMKs were still active. In agreement with previous
results, FTS alone decreased stress fiber formation in
NF-/- cells by 20% ± 5.6% (Fig. 5). The decrease in
stress fiber formation following the combined treatment
was synergistic (74% ± 1.5%; the combination index
calculated by the Loewe additive method was 0.43, i.e.,
less than 1, indicating synergism [31]; Fig. 5). The above
results supported the notion that FTS and LIMK inhibitor
operate through different pathways.

synergistic

The results described above led us to investigate the
effect of T56-LIMKi on the actin cytoskeleton, structures
that exhibit dramatic changes during cell migration [32].
To this end we stained control (untreated) NF1-/- MEFs
and NF1-/- MEFs treated with T56-LIMKi or FTS or their
combination with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin, which
labels polymeric F-actin. We then examined the effect
of the T56-LIMKi alone on the cell cytoskeleton, and
specifically on stress-fiber formation. Quantitative analysis
of NF-/- MEFs indicated that 50µM T56-LIMKi caused a

inhibit Rho, which are deficient in neurofibromin [11].
Accordingly, it is possible that the potential regulation of
cofilin by Ras is cancelled in NF1-/- cells. Taken together,
these data suggest that combinations of inhibitors of each
of the above pathways may act synergistically to inhibit
NF1-/- cell spreading and motility
In a recent review of LIM kinases it was indeed
suggested that these enzymes are attractive targets for drug
therapy. However, only a few small-molecule modulators
that are useful for drug treatment have been identified [17].
Small LIMK-inhibitor molecules have been identified by a
screening of small-molecule libraries [24]. Recent studies
suggested computer-based techniques for identification of
new LIMK inhibitors [3, 17]. Here we employed a new
computer-based procedure in which we identified the new
inhibitor by searching for structural homologues of LIMK,
such as EphA3, which has a known inhibitor. Following
homology modeling, we first found that the active sites
of the EphA3 receptor and LIMK2 are highly similar. We
then used the structure of the known EphA3 inhibitor,
AWL-II-38.3, and found that it fits to LIMK2 and LIMK1
ATP-binding and substrate-binding pockets (Fig. 2, C).
We therefore decided to use a similar compound (T56LIMKi), which was expected to bind with LIMK2/1 (Fig.
2, C) and block their kinase activity.
Next, we tested the compound T56-LIMKi
biologically and found that it is indeed a novel inhibitor
of LIMK. T56-LIMKi inhibited the phosphorylation of
cofilin (see Fig. 3). Notably, the reduction in p-cofilin
was accompanied by actin severing (Fig. 5) and inhibition
of cell migration (Fig. 6), cell proliferation (Fig. 4), and
anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar
(Fig. 7). Because LIMK1/2 regulation by NF1 is Rasindependent [2, 11, 17, 18], and because we observed a
synergistic inhibition of NF1-deficient cell proliferation
and stress-fiber formation by combined treatment with
T56-LIMKi and the Ras inhibitor FTS (Fig. 5), we
propose this combination as a novel approach of potential
value for NF1 therapy. It is important to bear in mind that
Ras regulates additional pathways including the MAPKERK, the PI3K, and the RalGDS pathways, all of which
control cycle control, apoptosis, and proliferation[35]
and are inhibited by FTS [36, 37] . Inhibition of these
pathways, together with inhibition of the LIMKs by T56LIMKi or other inhibitors, may also synergistically reverse
the malignant phenotype of neurofibromin-depleted cells,
including NF1-/- schwannoma in neurofibromatosis, and of
other cancer cells. The present study thus offers a possible
new method for the treatment of neurofibromatosis
patients

To examine the effect of the inhibitor on cell
migration, we performed a wound-healing cell migration
assay [33] using wild-type (wt) and NF1-/- MEFs. The
cells were plated in 35-mm plates and incubated with or
without the T56-LIMKi inhibitor. After 24 hours a scratch
wound was inflicted on both sets of cells. To inhibit
cell proliferation the cells were maintained in medium
containing 0.5% FCS, and the width of the gap formed
by the scratch was monitored at the indicated time points.
Figure 6A shows the results of a typical experiment
using wt and NF1-/- MEFs, with and without T56-LIMKi
inhibitor. The quantified results are shown in Fig. 6B. The
gap closed faster in the untreated NF1-/- MEF cells than
in the treated cells (Fig. 6). For example, in the untreated
cells 50% of the gap was closed within 3 hours, whereas
only 10% of the gap was closed in the T56-LIMKi-treated
cells (Fig. 6A and B). The mobility of the wt MEFs, unlike
that of the NF1-/- MEFs, was not affected by the inhibitor
(Fig. 6A and B).

anchorageindependent cell growth of NF1-/- MEFs.
As a measure of cell transformation we examined
whether T56-LIMKi affects the anchorage-independent
growth of the NF1-/- MEFs. These cells grow in soft
agar and have the ability to form colonies ([11]; Fig.
7), whereas the wt MEFs do not grow in soft agar (data
not shown). We found that T56-LIMKi inhibited colony
formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7).

DISCUSSION
Neurofibromin appears to regulate cell motility by
three distinct GTPase pathways through two different
domains, the GRD and the pre-GRD domains (Fig. 1). The
first pathway, which is controlled by the GRD domain, is
the Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK pathway. This pathway is inhibited
by the Ras inhibitor FTS [16]. It regulates the expression
of genes that control cell spreading and cell motility [16].
The second pathway is also regulated by the GRD domain,
not through classic Ras downstream effectors but rather
via the Rho-ROCK-LIMK2-cofilin pathway [2]. However,
in previous experiments [11], confirmed here (not shown),
reduction in p-cofilin levels was not detectable by the
Ras inhibitor FTS. The third pathway is regulated by the
pre-GRD domain and is mediated through Rac-Pak1LIMK1-cofilin [11, 17]. In line with previous findings, we
expected that Ras would also be involved in regulation
of cofilin because both Rho and Rac can be regulated
by Ras (32‒34). It is possible, however, that Ras affects
Rho and Rac in different directions, namely, it activates
Rac, which (as reported in U87 glioblastoma [34]) in turn

MATERIALS AND METHODS

μM). In each plate three areas were scratched, creating
three gaps of similar widths. The media and the inhibitors
were then replenished. Immediately thereafter, and at the
time points indicated in Results, phase-contrast images of
the plates were obtained with a CCD camera connected
to an Olympus fluorescence microscope (×10 objective).
We marked the region imaged at zero time to enable us
to photograph the same area at different times, so that we
could examine a specific population of migrating cells. The
widths of gaps treated with the inhibitor and at different
time points were measured with the aid of Image-Pro Plus
software. The data acquired from the three scratches on
each plate were averaged to obtain the mean gap width
at a given time. Statistical analysis disclosed either the
mean gap width (in arbitrary units) of T56-LIMKi-treated
cells relative to the control at different time points (means
± SD, n = 9) or the percentage of migration, calculated
as the width of the gap still open at the final time point,
expressed as a percentage of the gap size at zero time for
each treatment (means ± SD, n = 9).

Bioinformatics
Homologous proteins were identified by the
Protein BLAST [26] and the I-TASSER [27] webservers.
Homology modeling was performed by MODELLER
[28]. We used the ZINC database [30] to search for a
commercially available compound that might inhibit
LIMK2. (For more details see the Results section.)
Cell culture procedures and materials.
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), both wildtype and NF1 knockout (NF1-/-), were prepared from
NF1+/- mice, as described previously [38]. Cells were
grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS),
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/
mL streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.
Compound T5601640 (defined here as T56-LIMKi)
was purchased from Ambinter (Paris, France). The LIMK
inhibitor BMS-5 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) was purchased
from SynKinase (Shanghai, China).

Western blot analysis.
NF1-/- MEFs were plated at a density of 1× 105 or 5
× 105 cells in 6-well plates or 10-cm dishes, respectively,
and were allowed to grow overnight in medium containing
10% FCS. The medium was then replaced with medium
containing 0.5% FCS, and the cells were treated for 2
hours with the indicated doses of T56-LIMKi. We then
lysed the cells with solubilization buffer (50 mMTrisHCl (pH 7.6), 20 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5%
NP40, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors),
and the lysate (50 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE
and then immunoblotted with one of the following
antibodies: anti-p-cofilin (1:1000), anti-cofilin (1:1000),
anti-β-tubulin (1:500). The immunoblots were exposed
to peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500), and protein
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
and quantified by densitometry (EZ-Qant). Rabbit anticofilin and p-cofilin (Ser3) were from Cell Signaling
Technolgy (Beverly, MA); mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody
was from Sigma-Aldrich; peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG
and peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA).

Anchorage-independent cell proliferation in soft agar.
Noble agar 2% (Difco, Detroit, MI) was mixed
with medium (DMEM × 2, containing 10% FCS, 4 mM
L-glutamine, 200 units/mL penicillin, and 0.2 mg/mL
streptomycin). The mixture (50 μL) was poured into each
well of 96-well plates to provide the base agar at a final
agar concentration of 1%. Agar (0.6%) was mixed with
DMEM × 2, containing cells at a density that provided 8
× 104 cells per well, and 50 μL of the mixture was plated
on the base agar (at a final concentration of 0.3%). T56LIMKi was prepared in DMEM × 1 containing 5% FCS
at different concentrations, and 100 μL of the mixture
was placed in each well so that the final concentrations
of T56-LIMKi were 0, 25 or 50 μM per well. The
cells were incubated for 14 days and then stained for
4 hours with 1 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), which stains active mitochondria in living
cells, and the colonies were imaged. Colonies larger than
0.16 mm2 (mean ± SD, n = 5) were counted using ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA).
The average percentage of colonies in each group (means
± SD, n = 5) was calculated by dividing the number of
colonies of a particular treatment and specific group
size by the number of colonies of the same size in the
corresponding untreated control group.

Fluorescence staining and confocal microscopy.
MEFs were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well
plates at densities of 2.5 × 104 cells per well. After 24
hours the medium was replaced with medium containing
0.5% FCS and the indicated doses of T56-LIMKi. Cells
were incubated for a further 24 hours and were then fixed,
permeabilized, and washed. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin
was added for 30 minutes and the slides were then washed,
mounted, and imaged. F-actin was visualized and then
photographed under an LSM510 confocal microscope
(×63 objective) fitted with rhodamine filters. For statistical
analysis we counted 100 cells from each slide, with or
without stress fibers, under an Olympus fluorescence

Scratch-induced migration assay.
This was done as described elsewhere [34]. NF1knockout and wt MEFs were seeded on 35-mm plates at a
density of 1.5 × 105 per plate. After 24 hours the medium
was replaced with 0.5% FCS containing DMEM, and
the cells were treated for 24 hours with T56-LIMKi (50
