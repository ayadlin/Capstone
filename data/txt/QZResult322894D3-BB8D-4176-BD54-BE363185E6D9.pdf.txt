ABSTRACT
Patients with pathological complete remission (pCR) after treated with neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) have better long-term outcome and may receive conservative
treatments in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The study aimed to evaluate the
value of forceps biopsy and core needle biopsy in prediction of pCR in LARC treated with
nCRT. In total, 120patients entered this study. Sixty-one consecutive patients received
preoperative forceps biopsy during endoscopic examination. Ex vivo core needle biopsy
was performed in resected specimens of another 43 consecutive patients. The accuracy
for ex vivo core needle biopsy was significantly higher than forceps biopsy (76.7%
vs. 36.1%; p < 0.001). The sensitivity for ex vivo core needle biopsy was significantly
lower in good responder (TRG 3) than poor responder (TRG ≤ 2) (52.9% vs. 94.1%;
p = 0.017). In vivo core needle biopsy was further performed in 16 patients with good
response. Eleven patients had residual cancer cells in final resected specimens, among
whom 4 (36.4%) patients were biopsy positive. In conclusion, routine forceps biopsy
was of limited value in identifying pCR after nCRT. Although core needle biopsy might
further identify a subset of patients with residual cancer cells, the accuracy was not
substantially increased in good responders.

To date, there are still no reliable methods to identify
patients with pCR before radical surgery. As a result,
clinical complete response (cCR), defined as no clinical
detectable tumor by physical examination, endoscopic
evaluation, and imaging, is designed as a surrogate
endpoint for pCR [4, 6]. However, the concordance
between cCR and pCR varies from 22% to 96% in
different reports [7–10], which questions the clinical value
of such strategies. Therefore, it is of crucial significance
to develop novel strategy to predict pCR for patients after
nCRT in LARC.
Forceps biopsy and core needle biopsy are
frequently used for the diagnosis of malignant tumors.

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by
total mesorectal excision (TEM) and systemic chemotherapy
is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced
rectal cancer (LARC) [1]. With this approach, 15–36% of
patients have no residual viable cancer cells at pathological
examination, referred as pathological complete remission
(pCR), and these patients have better long-term outcome
[2, 3]. Studies suggest that conservative approaches, such
as local excision or even avoidance of surgery, might be
alternative choices without compromising the oncologic
outcome for patients with pCR [4, 5].

Core needle biopsy is considered to be more accurate
especially in tumor beneath epithelium which is a common
phenomenon in LARC after neoadjuvant CRT. So far,
there is no study reporting its value in evaluating pCR
in the patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT. This study
aimed to evaluate the value of forceps biopsy and core
needle biopsy in predicting pCR in LARC after nCRT.

Among 35 patients with residual cancer cells in the
final resected specimens, 17 patients were TRG ≤ 2; 17
patients were TRG = 3; and 1 patient was pathological
complete regression in primary tumor (ypT0 or TRG4) but
had residual tumor cells in the lymph nodes (ypN+). The
sensitivity was 94.1% with TRG ≤ 2 and 52.9% with TRG
= 3. The sensitivity was significantly different between
TRG ≤ 2 and TRG = 3 (p = 0.017) (Table 6).

RESULTS

Diagnostic performance of in vivo core
needle biopsy

Patients’ demographics

Sixteen patients with good response evaluated
by digital rectal examination, colonoscopy and forceps
biopsy, and MRI after nCRT received in vivo core needle
biopsy. Residual cancer cells were detected in 11 (68.8%)
patients at the final pathologic examination, among
whom 4 patients were biopsy positive. The sensitivity was
36.4%, and the specificity was 100%. Of the 12 patients
negative at in vivo core needle biopsy, 5 patients achieved
pCR. The negative predictive value was 41.7%. The
overall accuracy was 56.3% (Table 7). Except for some
discomfort experienced during the biopsy, no serious
procedure-related complications were observed in any of
these 16 patients.

Sixty-one patients received endoscopic forceps biopsy,
among whom 12 (19.7%) patients achieved pCR. Ex vivo
core needle biopsy was performed in 43 patients, among
whom 8 (18.6%) achieved pCR. No statistically significant
differences in the baseline characteristics were found
between patients undergoing forceps biopsy and ex vivo core
needle biopsy, except the interval between radiotherapy (RT)
completion and biopsy (Table 1). In vivo core needle biopsy
was performed in 16 patients with good response after CRT,
and 5 (31.3%) patients achieved pCR (Table 2). There was
no overlapping between different groups.

Diagnostic performance of endoscopic
forceps biopsy

DISCUSSION

Sixty-one patients received endoscopic forceps
biopsy, among whom 51 patients were negative at biopsy
and only 12 patients had no viable cancer cells found
in the final resected specimens. The negative predictive
value referred as the predictive value of pCR was 23.5%.
Forty-nine patients had residual cancer cells in the final
surgical specimens, among whom 10 patients were biopsy
positive. The sensitivity was 20.4%, and the specificity
was 100%. The overall accuracy was 36.1%. The result
of histopathological findings of forceps biopsy compared
with the surgical specimen was listed in Table 3.
Of the 49 patients with residual cancer cells at
resected specimen (non-pCR), 16 (32.7%) patients were
TRG ≤ 2 and 33 (67.3%) patients were TRG = 3. The
sensitivity was not significantly different between TRG ≤
2 and TRG = 3 (31.3% vs. 15.2%; p = 0.351) (Table 4).

Our study demonstrates that forceps biopsy is an
inaccurate method of identifying patients with pCR after
nCRT. Although the accuracy of ex vivo core needle
biopsy has been markedly improved compared to forceps
biopsy, the accuracy of in vivo core needle biopsy is far
from perfect in the patients with good response. To our
knowledge, it is the first study to analyze the value of
core needle biopsy in predicting pCR through ex vivo and
in vivo. The findings of this study may have significant
clinical implications because they highlight the limitation
of forceps biopsy and core needle biopsy in prediction of
pCR in LARC treated with nCRT.
In patients with negative forceps biopsy, only 23.5%
patients achieved pCR, which is consistent with the
previous reports showing that the negative predictive value
for forceps biopsy was 21.4% and 36% [11, 12]. Similarly,
in a Habr-Gama’s study, the negative predictive value was
21% for those with significant tumor downsizing [13].
The low accuracy might be attributed to the redistribution
of the residual cancer cells after CRT. Duldulao MP et al
revealed that residual cancer cells in rectal cancer after
CRT preferentially located to the invasive front of the
tumor, and at least 25% patients with cT2 tumors and
more than 40% patients with cT3/4 tumors after CRT
that did not achieve pCR would have no residual cancer
cells in the mucosa or submucosa [14]. Dana M. Hayden
and Fraser M. Smith reported that residual tumor cells
were presented lateral and distal to the residual mucosal

Diagnostic performance of ex vivo core needle
biopsy
Ex vivo core needle biopsy was performed in
43 resected specimens. Of the 18 patients with biopsy
negative, 8 achieved pCR. The negative predictive value
was 44.4%. Thirty-five patients had residual cancer cells
in the final resected specimens, among whom 25 patients
were positive at core needle biopsy. The sensitivity was
71.4%, and the specificity was 100%. The overall accuracy
was 76.7%. Concordance between surgical specimen and
ex vivo core needle biopsy samples was listed in Table 5.

abnormalities in patients after neoadjuvant radiotherapy
[15, 16]. The current study reinforces that forceps biopsy
is of limited clinical value due to the inherent flaws of
inability to obtain specimens deep to the muscularis or
subserosa layer.
To date, there is no study reporting the value of
core needle biopsy in predicting a pCR. Therefore,
we hypothesized that core needle biopsy might improve
the diagnostic performance. In the current study, we
first confirmed the hypothesis by performing an ex vivo
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

core needle biopsy in the tumor bed in the resected
specimen. Our results showed that the overall accuracy
was significantly improved compared to forceps biopsy
(76.7% vs. 36.1%; p < 0.001). We further tested the
hypothesis by in vivo core needle biopsy guided by
ERUS in good responders. Although the method is able
to identify additional 36.4% of patients with residual
disease after ruling out patients with obvious nonpCR, the overall accuracy is far from perfect. These
were not unexpected since a false-negative result was

of in vivo core needle biopsy, which may contribute to
the low accuracy. Meanwhile, it might be more difficult
to determine the target lesion in ERUS than direct
observation in ex vivo core needle biopsy.

Of note, one patient (11.1%) obtained ex vivo core
needle biopsy achieved primary tumor regression (ypT0)
but had residual tumor cells in the lymph nodes (ypN+).
This incidence ranged from 2% to 17% in previous
studies [17, 18]. The inability of those biopsy approaches
or radical imagine techniques to accurately identify these
patients might challenge the less aggressive strategy.
Limitations in this study should be mentioned. Several
studies demonstrated that a prolonged interval to assess
tumor response could maximize tumor regression and result
in a higher chance of pCR [19, 20]. In this study, patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

underwent ex vivo core needle biopsy nearly 2 weeks later than
other approaches, which may account for some discrepancies.
In addition, this study was performed in a single-institution and
the selected population of in vivo core needle biopsy in good
responders might also leaded to bias.
In conclusion, the current study showed that forceps
biopsy was of limited clinical value in identifying patients
with pCR after CRT. Although, core needle biopsy might
further identify a subset of patients with residual cancer
cells, the accuracy was not substantially increased in good
responders.

ulcer or former tumor location. Before the biopsy, patients
received routine cleansing enema by 0.1% soap solution.
Patients were examined initially with the ultrasound probe
in the left lateral decubitus position. When hypoechoic
area of the rectal wall was identified through ERUS and
felt to represent the suspicious site of residual tumor, core
needle biopsy would be performed under direct ultrasound
guidance with an 18-gauge core needle. At least 3 samples
were achieved in each patient.

Patients
Between Nov. 2011 and Dec. 2013, a total of 120
patients with LARC treated with nCRT at Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center were prospectively included in
this study. This study was approved by the Institutional
Ethical Review Boards of the Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center, and performed in accordance with the
ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient
before enrollment in the trial. All patients were biopsyproven adenocarcinoma. Clinical staging of local tumor
was performed by Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) and
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).
The total dosage of radiotherapy was 50 Gy
consisted of 23 fractions of 2 Gy to clinical target volume
and 2 fractions of 2 Gy to gross tumor volume. Patients
received two cycles of modified XELOX (Oxaliplatin
100 mg/m2 d1, Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid, d1–14)
regimens on day 1–14 and day 21–34 concomitant to
radiotherapy. The standard TME surgery was planned 6 to
8 weeks after completion of nCRT.

Pathologic assessment
All the biopsy samples were sent for routine
pathological analysis and compared with the
histopathological result of the resected specimens.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and accuracy were analyzed.
Pathological stage was determined according to
the AJCC 7th edition [21]. Neoadjuvant CRT effect was
evaluated using tumor regression grade (TRG) system
by Dworak et al as follows [22]: Grade 0: no regression;
Grade 1: dominant tumor mass with obvious fibrosis and/
or vasculopathy; Grade 2: dominantly fibrotic changes
with few tumor cells or groups (easy to find); Grade 3 (or
nearly pCR): very few (difficult to find microscopically)
tumor cells in fibrotic tissue with or without mucous
substance; Grade 4: no tumor cells, only fibrotic mass
(total regression or response).

Forceps biopsy, ex vivo core needle biopsy, and
in vivo core needle biopsy
Firstly, 61 patients were consecutively enrolled
into the forceps biopsy group to evaluate the value in
prediction of pCR. These patients underwent forceps
biopsies during the endoscopic examination using 2.8mm biopsy forceps about 6 weeks after the completion
of nCRT. At least 3 biopsy samples were taken from the
suspicious sites from every patient.
To evaluate the possible role of core needle biopsy
in the diagnosis of pCR, 43 patients were subsequently
enrolled to the ex vivo core needle biopsy group before
proceeding with the procedure in vivo. The standard
TME surgery was performed 6 to 8 weeks after the end
of nCRT. Once the specimen was removed and opened,
the researcher performed an ex vivo core needle biopsy
with an 18-gauge core needle direct to three representative
regions of the tumor bed. In patients with suspected
macroscopic complete response, the scar tissue was
biopsied accordingly.
To validate the ex vivo findings and evaluate the
safety of the procedure, core needle biopsy was further
performed in vivo about 6 weeks after the completion of
nCRT in 16 patients with good response. The definition
of good response, determined by clinical examination,
endoscopy and forceps biopsy, and MRI, was (1)
substantial tumor downsizing (>30% reduction of the
initial tumor size); (2) No obvious residual tumor or deep
ulceration at endoscopy. A superficial ulcer or scar might
be acceptable; and (3) negative forceps biopsies from the
