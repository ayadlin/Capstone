SUMMARY
Inhibition of BCR-ABL by imatinib induces durable responses in many patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML), but resistance attributable to kinase domain mutations can lead to relapse and a
switch to second-line therapy with nilotinib or dasatinib. Despite three approved therapeutic options,
the cross-resistant BCR-ABLT315I mutation and compound mutants selected on sequential inhibitor
therapy remain major clinical challenges. We report design and pre-clinical evaluation of AP24534,
a potent, orally available multi-targeted kinase inhibitor active against T315I and other BCR-ABL
mutants. AP24534 inhibited all tested BCR-ABL mutants in cellular and biochemical assays,

SIGNIFICANCE
The ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib is the current standard first-line therapy for patients with BCR-ABL-positive leukemia. The secondline ABL kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib are effective salvage therapies for patients who relapse on imatinib. BCRABLT315I, a mutant resistant to all approved ABL kinase inhibitors, is emerging as a common pathway of failure on all three inhibitors.
AP24534 is an orally active multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits BCR-ABLT315I. It may represent a treatment option
for patients with this mutation and complement the current clinically employed inhibitors. Longer term, a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor such
as AP24534 may offer important strategic advantages in a first-line capacity by minimizing BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation-based
drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION
The judicious use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target BCR-ABL constitutes an effective
strategy for sustained disease control in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The exemplar of
targeted therapy in CML is the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec; STI571), a safe and
effective first-line therapy for most patients diagnosed with chronic phase disease (Druker et
al., 2006). Although most patients attain a durable complete cytogenetic response, minimal
residual disease persists in nearly all patients, and active disease recurs if treatment is
discontinued. More importantly, discontinuation of imatinib due to intolerance or resistance is
necessary in up to 30% of patients within the first five years on therapy. Also, durable responses
are uncommon in patients with advanced CML or Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Resistance to imatinib usually involves point mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL
that impair inhibitor binding. A broad spectrum of kinase domain mutations that confer
resistance to the drug have been reported (Hughes et al., 2006). Clinically, identification of a
BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation provides a potential explanation for imatinib resistance
and suggests a clear treatment strategy: second-line therapy with an ABL kinase inhibitor active
against the particular BCR-ABL mutant present in the patient (Jabbour et al., 2009). To date,
two ABL kinase inhibitors have achieved regulatory approval for second-line use: the imatinib
family member nilotinib (Tasigna; AMN107) and the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib
(Sprycel; BMS-354825) (Shah et al., 2004; Weisberg et al., 2005). With the availability of
these three oral BCR-ABL inhibitors, most patients are successfully matched to an appropriate
and effective drug, leading to retained or recaptured response. However, several kinase domain
mutations confer high-level resistance to one or more of these therapies, in particular the BCRABLT315I mutation, which confers resistance to all three (reviewed by (O’Hare et al., 2007)).

Given the location of the T315 residue in the gatekeeper region of the ATP-binding site, the
T315I mutant has proven difficult to inhibit with ATP mimetics. Modeling analysis indicates
that the mutation eliminates a critical hydrogen bonding interaction required for high-affinity
binding of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib and alters the topology of the ATP-binding pocket
(Tokarski et al., 2006; Weisberg et al., 2005). Although several reports have described
approaches to overcome this, compound-to-clinic progress has been slow (reviewed by
(Quintas-Cardama and Cortes, 2008)). Several ATP competitive inhibitors originally designed
to target the Aurora kinase family have been found to be active against ABLT315I, including
MK-0457, PHA-739358, AT9283, and XL-228 (Quintas-Cardama and Cortes, 2008). These
molecules have been formulated for intravenous administration in the clinic, and MK-0457
has shown some activity as salvage therapy for advanced phase CML patients harboring the
T315I mutation (Giles et al., 2007), but clinical development has been halted due to toxicity
concerns.
The importance of controlling mutation-mediated resistance is underscored by recent reports
on the potential for sequential ABL kinase inhibitor therapy to select for compound (multiple
mutations in same BCR-ABL allele) mutants resistant to all current ABL inhibitors, including

some that do not involve T315I (Shah et al., 2007). Therefore, an optimal next-generation ABL
inhibitor capable of exerting a high level of disease control in CML would incorporate potent
activity against BCR-ABLT315I and the full range of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations as
well as the native (unmutated) enzyme, while matching the pharmacologic advantages of the
currently approved therapies. Here we report on the design and pre-clinical testing of AP24534,
an orally active pan-inhibitor of BCR-ABL, including BCR-ABLT315I.

RESULTS
Design of AP24534 and Crystallographic Analysis of AP24534:ABLT315I
Recent X-ray crystallographic studies on the ABL kinase domain reveal that the threonine to
isoleucine gatekeeper mutation, T315I, acts as a simple point mutant without significant
perturbation of the overall protein structure (Zhou et al., 2007). Thus, as imatinib, nilotinib,
and dasatinib each form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of T315 in native ABL, we
designed ligands devoid of this interaction by introducing vinyl and ethyl linkages into a purinebased inhibitor scaffold (Wang et al., 2008) targeting both DFG-in (active) and DFG-out
(inactive) binding modes. One DFG-out targeted compound also inhibited ABLT315I in
biochemical and cellular assays (M. Azam, personal communication; (Huang et al., 2009)).
Subsequent structure-guided design experiments led to AP24534 (Figure 1A), which
accommodates the T315I side chain by virtue of a carbon-carbon triple bond (ethynyl) linkage.

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

X-ray crystallographic analysis of AP24534 in complex with the murine ABLT315I kinase
domain confirmed that AP24534 binds in the DFG-out mode (Figure 1B and 1C) and maintains
a network of protein contacts similar to imatinib (Figure 1D and 1E). Specifically, the imidazo
[1,2b]pyridazine core of AP24534 occupies the adenine pocket of the enzyme, the
methylphenyl group occupies the hydrophobic pocket behind the gatekeeper residue, the
trifluoromethylphenyl group binds tightly to the pocket induced by the DFG-out conformation
of the protein, and the ethynyl linkage of AP24534 makes favorable van der Waals interactions
with the I315 mutated residue. A total of five hydrogen bonds are made between the inhibitor
and the protein, including: with the backbone of M318 in the hinge region, with the backbone
of D381, and with the side chain of E286 (Figure 1C), as well as two hydrogen bonds from the
methylpiperazine group (not shown). The P-loop of the kinase is collapsed in this conformation,
bringing Y253 into van der Waals contact with AP24534. Additional favorable contacts are
made between the inhibitor and F382 of the DFG motif, displaced outwards into the ligandbinding site in the DFG-out mode. Although the methylphenyl groups occupying the
hydrophobic pocket and hinge hydrogen bonding moieties of AP24534 and imatinib are placed
similarly (Figure 1D), superposition of the two inhibitors shows AP24534 engaging in
productive van der Waals interactions with I315, while steric clash between imatinib and the
I315 side chain is evident (Figure 1E).
AP24534 Inhibits the Catalytic Activity of ABLT315I
We tested the activity of AP24534, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib in biochemical assays
with purified, dephosphorylated, native ABL and ABLT315I. All inhibitors diminished the
enzymatic activity of native ABL, but only AP24534 was effective against the ABLT315I
mutant (Figure 2). Similar potent inhibition by AP24534 was observed for additional imatinibresistant ABL mutants tested, including ABLG250E, ABLY253F, and ABLE255K (not shown),
establishing that AP24534 directly targets native and mutant ABL kinase, including
ABLT315I.
Kinase Selectivity Profile of AP24534
The in vitro potency and selectivity of AP24534 was assessed in kinase assays with multiple
recombinant kinase domains and peptide substrates (Table 1 and Table S1). AP24534 potently

inhibited native ABL (IC50: 0.37 nM), ABLT315I (IC50: 2.0 nM), and other clinically important
ABL kinase domain mutants (IC50: 0.30–0.44 nM) (Table 1). AP24534 also inhibited SRC
(IC50: 5.4 nM) and members of the VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR families of receptor tyrosine
kinases (Table 1 and Table S1). AP24534 did not inhibit Aurora kinase family members, nor
did it inhibit insulin receptor or cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)/Cyclin E (IC50 > 1000-fold
relative to native ABL).
AP24534 Inhibits the Growth of Cells Expressing Native or Mutant BCR-ABL
Cellular proliferation assays were performed with parental Ba/F3 cells and Ba/F3 cells
expressing native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL with a range of single mutations in the kinase
domain. AP24534 potently inhibited proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL
(IC50: 0.5 nM). All BCR-ABL mutants tested remained sensitive to AP24534 (IC50: 0.5–36
nM; Table 2) including BCR-ABLT315I (IC50: 11 nM). Annexin V staining confirmed that
inhibition of proliferation by AP24534 correlated with induction of apoptosis (not shown).
Growth of parental Ba/F3 cells was inhibited only at significantly higher IC50 (1713 nM),
indicating a substantial differential selectivity for inhibition of BCR-ABL-positive cells. Ba/
F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells grown in the presence of IL-3 exhibited an IC50 (1804 nM) similar to
that of parental Ba/F3 cells.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We also tested AP24534 against BCR-ABL-positive and -negative cell lines derived from
leukemic patients. While we observed potent growth inhibition of K562, KY01, and LAMA
cells (derived from CML patients in blast crisis), there was no significant activity against three
BCR-ABL-negative leukemia cell lines (Table 2).
AP24534 Inhibits BCR-ABL-Mediated Signaling in Cells Expressing BCR-ABLT315I
To confirm target inhibition in Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I,
we examined the effect of AP24534 on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of BCR-ABL
(Figure S1) and the direct BCR-ABL substrate CrkL (Figure 3), with the three approved ABL
inhibitors included for comparison. Monitoring CrkL tyrosine phosphorylation status as a
surrogate for BCR-ABL kinase activity has been the preferred pharmacodynamic assay in
clinical trials of BCR-ABL inhibitors (Druker et al., 2001; Talpaz et al., 2006). In the CrkL
gel shift assay, the percentage of tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkL (upper band) decreases in
response to inhibition of BCR-ABL. While all tested inhibitors were effective against Ba/F3
cells expressing native BCR-ABL (Figure 3A), only AP24534 demonstrated activity against
the T315I mutant (Figure 3B). Inhibition of BCR-ABL phosphorylation was observed in
parallel experiments (Figure S1).

Treatment of CML Primary Cells with AP24534 Inhibits Cellular Proliferation
To assess the efficacy of AP24534 on primary cells from patients with BCR-ABL-driven
leukemia, we exposed mononuclear cells derived from blood or bone marrow from CML
myeloid blast crisis patients harboring native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I and from healthy
individuals to graded concentrations of AP24534 and assayed viable cells after 72 hr.
Consistent with biochemical and cell line viability data, AP24534 induced a selective reduction
of viable cell numbers in primary CML cells, with IC50 values approximately 500-fold lower
than those observed with normal cells (Figure 4A). Neither imatinib nor dasatinib reached an
IC50 (highest concentration: 1000 nM) in primary CML BCR-ABLT315I cells (data not shown).
AP24534 Inhibits BCR-ABLT315I Kinase Activity and Colony Formation in Primary CML Cells
To monitor target inhibition following ex vivo exposure to AP24534 of mononuclear cells
obtained from a CML T315I lymphoid blast crisis patient, we carried out an assay similar to
that described for Ba/F3 cell lines, wherein cells were incubated with inhibitors and then

analyzed for CrkL phosphorylation by immunoblot. Exposure to AP24534 resulted in a
reduction in phosphorylated CrkL signal while none of the other ABL inhibitors had an effect
(Figure 4B); similar results were obtained upon analysis for global tyrosine phosphorylation
by flow cytometry (Figure 4C).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We also evaluated the efficacy of AP24534 in myeloid colony formation assays using
mononuclear cells from a CML T315I accelerated phase patient and from a healthy individual.
Whereas neither nilotinib nor dasatinib showed an effect against patient-derived T315I cells,
AP24534 inhibited the formation of colonies in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure
S2A) and exhibited no toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells at concentrations below 500 nM
(Figure S2B), consistent with cellular proliferation assay data obtained using normal cells
(Figure 4A).
Oral AP24534 Prolongs Survival and Reduces Tumor Burden in Mice with BCR-ABLT315IDependent Disease

HHMI Author Manuscript

To examine the pharmacologic properties of AP24534, mice were administered a single oral
dose and plasma concentrations were then measured at multiple time points. In mice
administered a dose of 2.5 mg/kg, mean plasma levels of 90, 58, and 2 nM were achieved at
2, 6, and 24 hr post-dose, respectively. At a dose of 30 mg/kg, mean plasma levels reached
782, 561, and 8 nM at the same time points. These results demonstrate that plasma levels
exceeding the in vitro IC50 values for all tested BCR-ABL mutants can be sustained in mice
for >6 hr at oral doses that are well tolerated, indicating that adequate target inhibition for a
therapeutic effect should be reached (Shah et al., 2008).
We next evaluated the efficacy of AP24534 in a survival model in which Ba/F3 cells expressing
native BCR-ABL were injected intravenously. As shown in Figure 5A (left), the median
survival time for vehicle-treated mice was 19 days. Daily oral treatment with 2.5 or 5 mg/kg
AP24534 for 19 days prolonged median survival to 27.5 and 30 days, respectively (p<0.01 for
both dose levels). These results were comparable to those achieved following daily oral
administration of 5 mg/kg dasatinib (a regimen previously reported to be efficacious
(Lombardo et al., 2004)), in which median survival was 27 days (p<0.01).
In a survival model in which mice were instead injected with Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells,
administration of dasatinib at doses as high as 300 mg/kg had no effect on survival time, as
expected (Figure S3). By contrast, treatment with AP24534 prolonged survival in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5A, right). AP24534 dosed orally for 19 days at 5, 15, and 25 mg/
kg prolonged median survival to 19.5, 26, and 30 days, respectively compared to 16 days for
vehicle-treated mice (p<0.01 for all three dose levels).

HHMI Author Manuscript

The anti-tumor activity of AP24534 was further assessed in a xenograft model in which Ba/
F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells were injected subcutaneously into mice. Tumor growth was inhibited
by AP24534 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5B, left) compared to vehicle-treated mice,
with significant suppression of tumor growth upon daily oral dosing at 10 and 30 mg/kg (%T/
C = 68% and 20%, respectively; p<0.01 for both dose levels). Daily oral dosing of 50 mg/kg
AP24534 caused significant tumor regression (%T/C = 0.9%, p<0.01), with a 96% reduction
in mean tumor volume at the final measurement compared to the start of treatment. AP24534
was well tolerated at all efficacious dose levels for the duration of the study; maximal decreases
in body weight were <5%, <5%, and <12% for the 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg dose groups,
respectively, with no signs of overt toxicity.
To confirm target inhibition, levels of phosphorylated BCR-ABLT315I and phosphorylated
CrkL were assessed in tumors from mice harvested 6 hr after one-time dosing with vehicle or

AP24534. As shown in Figure 5B (right), a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg markedly decreased
levels of phosphorylated BCR-ABL and phosphorylated CrkL.
Single-Agent AP24534 Completely Suppresses Outgrowth of Resistant Clones

HHMI Author Manuscript

To survey for potential sites of vulnerability to resistance, we tested AP24534 in our established
accelerated mutagenesis assay. This assay has previously been used to characterize the
resistance profile of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, and has proved to be predictive of clinical
experience with these inhibitors (Bradeen et al., 2006). In this screen, a BCR-ABL-driven cell
line is exposed to mutagen, and then plated into tissue culture wells with graded concentrations
of inhibitor. Outgrowth of cells reflects the emergence of resistant subclones, which are
sequenced to identify BCR-ABL mutations.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Initially, we performed mutagenesis experiments using Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCRABL at several concentrations of AP24534 (5–40 nM) and found a concentration-dependent
reduction in both the percentage of wells with outgrowth and in the scope of mutations observed
(Figure 6A). At 5 nM AP24534, all wells (576/576) exhibited outgrowth and 90% of the
sequenced representative subclones expressed native BCR-ABL (Table S2). Raising the
concentration of AP24534 to 10 nM resulted in both a marked reduction in outgrowth
(168/1440 wells; 11.7%) and an increased frequency of mutated subclones (33.1%; Table S2).
Mutations recovered included occurrences at several P-loop residues (G250, Q252, Y253, and
E255), a cluster at the C-helix (K285, E292, and L298), and T315 (T315I), as well as F317,
V339, F359, L387, and S438. Among the recovered mutations, nearly all have been previously
encountered in resistance to imatinib, nilotinib, and/or dasatinib (reviewed by (O’Hare et al.,
2007)). No mutations were encountered that were specific for AP24534 only.
We next investigated 20 nM AP24534 and found that outgrowth was sharply curtailed (3/1440
wells; 0.2%), with only two mutations, E255V and T315I, persisting (Figure 6A and Table
S2). Thus, within our extensive survey, no previously undiscovered mutations capable of
conferring high-level resistance to AP24534 were identified. At 40 nM AP24534, which is 43fold lower than the IC50 for parental BaF/3 cells, complete suppression of in vitro resistance
was achieved. This absence of resistant outgrowth was further confirmed at higher
concentrations of AP24534 (80–320 nM; not shown).
Effects of AP24534 on Compound Mutants

HHMI Author Manuscript

Having identified a limited resistance susceptibility profile for AP24534 at the level of single
mutations, we wanted to investigate the vulnerability to compound mutations, defined as two
kinase domain mutations in the same allele, which have been detected in some treatment
failures (Khorashad et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2007; Stagno et al., 2008). To simulate the situation
in which AP24534 is used to treat a patient with a predominant T315I subclone, we repeated
the accelerated mutagenesis assay, this time starting with an existing T315I mutation (Figure
6B and Table S3). We found that there was still a concentration-dependent hierarchy and that
AP24534 at a concentration of 160 nM or lower overcame all compound mutants involving
T315I except Y253H/T315I and E255V/T315I. At 320 nM, the only remaining compound
mutant was E255V/T315I, which couples the two most resistant single mutants, and outgrowth
was completely suppressed at the highest concentration (640 nM) tested, still ~3-fold below
the IC50 for parental Ba/F3 cell line inhibition. This resistance profile was confirmed in a
subsequent screen starting from a background of BCR-ABLE255V, the most resistant single
BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation to AP24534, with the E255V/T315I compound mutant
again persisting to 320 nM and being eliminated at 640 nM (Table S4).

DISCUSSION

HHMI Author Manuscript

AP24534 is a next-generation ABL kinase inhibitor optimized using structure-based drug
design to bind to the inactive, DFG-out conformation of ABL and ABLT315I. The key structural
feature of the molecule is a carbon-carbon triple bond linkage that makes productive
hydrophobic contact with the side chain of I315, allowing inhibition of the T315I mutant. The
triple bond also acts as an inflexible connector that enforces correct positioning of the two
binding segments of AP24534 into their established binding pockets. AP24534 maintains an
extensive hydrogen-bonding network and occupies a region of the kinase that overlaps
significantly with the imatinib binding site.

HHMI Author Manuscript

A key design feature of AP24534 underlying its pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor profile is
incorporation of multiple contact points to confer very high potency and to balance and
distribute the overall binding affinity. While each of the hydrogen-bonding and contact residue
interactions contribute substantially to the inhibitor’s affinity for its target, mutation-based
disruption of one element of the binding network or distortion of a sub-region within the binding
pocket results in only a slight reduction in affinity. As a consequence, AP24534 also retains
potency against other imatinib-resistant ABL mutants in addition to ABLT315I. While
mutations that destabilize the inactive conformation of ABL to which AP24534 binds,
including T315I and E255V, result in modest reductions in binding affinity, substantial
reductions would be expected to require at least two changes at non-proximal residues – a
prediction consistent with findings from our mutagenesis screen.
Kinase selectivity studies showed that AP24534 does not inhibit Aurora kinases, clearly
distinguishing it from other T315I inhibitors in development. These studies also revealed
inhibition of SRC, LYN, PDGFRα, and c-KIT with <10-fold selectivity compared to
ABLT315I. Several of these kinases are important clinical targets of imatinib, nilotinib and/or
dasatinib, although only dasatinib has been reported to inhibit SRC family kinases. Although
assay differences preclude direct comparison of the kinase profiles of AP24534 and dasatinib,
a comprehensive kinase interaction map for dasatinib was recently reported (Karaman et al.,
2008). In general, the linearity of the triple bond in AP24534 is predicted to minimize steric
clash between the inhibitor and hydrophobic gatekeeper residues. This feature probably
contributes to the relatively broad kinase specificity profile of AP24534, which includes
VEGFR and FGFR family kinases, receptors not inhibited by the three currently approved
BCR-ABL drugs. As SRC, VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR family kinases are potential targets
in a variety of other malignancies, this supports the potential testing of AP24534 in a wider
range of cancers.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Evaluation of AP24534 in cellular proliferation assays confirmed its potent pan-BCR-ABL
inhibition against cells expressing native or mutant BCR-ABL, including BCR-ABLT315I,
while retaining a high degree of selectivity (>1000-fold) for Ph-positive cells. Among the BCRABL mutants tested, the E255V mutant, which confers high-level resistance to imatinib and
intermediate-level resistance to nilotinib and dasatinib (O’Hare et al., 2007), was most resistant
to AP24534. Notably, AP24534 potently inhibited mutants at residues Y253 and F359 (which
have been reported in patients failing nilotinib (Cortes et al., 2007; Kantarjian et al., 2007)),
as well as F317 (implicated in clinical resistance to dasatinib (Burgess et al., 2005; Cortes et
al., 2007; Khorashad et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2007; Talpaz et al., 2006)). While clinically
achievable and effective doses will need to be determined, the sizeable selectivity for BCRABL-expressing cells (regardless of mutational status) over normal cells suggests the potential
for efficacy with minimal toxicity.
In clinical studies of BCR-ABL inhibitors, pharmacodynamic evaluation of target inhibition
is an important component of dose optimization. In the preclinical studies reported here we

monitored phosphorylation of CrkL, a direct substrate of native and mutant BCR-ABL, by
immunoblot analysis. In both Ba/F3 cells and primary CML BCR-ABLT315I cells, treatment
with AP24534 resulted in a marked reduction in phosphorylated CrkL, while imatinib,
dasatinib, and nilotinib had no effect. This assay was recently used to monitor BCR-ABL
activity in patients treated with nilotinib; values of percent phosphorylated CrkL from serially
collected peripheral blood samples were consistent with BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation
status and matched closely with other measures of response, including BCR-ABL transcript
levels and white cell counts (La Rosee et al., 2008). Given its extensive validation in the clinic,
this assay is being employed to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of AP24534 in its phase
1 evaluation.

The oral bioavailability of AP24534 was confirmed in mouse pharmacology studies, where
concentrations above the IC50s for all tested mutants could be safely sustained following daily
oral dosing. AP24534 demonstrated potent activity after daily oral administration in a series
of mouse models of CML driven by native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I. In a survival model
using Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL, AP24534 significantly prolonged survival at
low doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg and demonstrated similar efficacy to dasatinib. In an analogous
model using BCR-ABLT315I cells, AP24534 significantly extended survival whereas dasatinib,
as expected, was inactive. AP24534 was also active in a subcutaneous BCR-ABLT315I tumor
model, where tumor stasis or regression occurred at doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg, and suppression
of BCR-ABL signaling was demonstrated using the shift CrkL phosphorylation assay.
AP24534 was well tolerated at all dose levels used in these studies. Thus, AP24534 is orally
bioavailable, inhibits its molecular target, and has a wide therapeutic range (5–50 mg/kg) in
BCR-ABLT315I dependent CML animal models.

Mutation-mediated resistance to clinical ABL inhibitors is the main route of BCR-ABL
signaling reactivation, particularly in chronic phase disease. As AP24534 advances into clinical
evaluation, anticipating potential resistance liabilities, especially compared to those of nilotinib
and dasatinib, will be important for prospective treatment decisions. Several mutations have
been reported in association with clinical resistance to nilotinib (L248V, Y253F/H, E255K/V,
T315I, F359C/V; (Cortes et al., 2007; Kantarjian et al., 2007)) or dasatinib (V299L, T315A/
I, F317I/L; (Cortes et al., 2007; Khorashad et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2007)) which are largely
consistent with our in vitro profiling (Bradeen et al., 2006). In our accelerated mutagenesis
screens for AP24534, we found a concentration-dependent reduction in both the percentage of
wells with outgrowth and in the range of mutations observed. Although at 10 nM AP24534 we
observed 16 different substitutions across 13 different residues, the only resistant subclones
recovered at 20 nM harbored either a T315I or E255V mutation, and at 40 nM AP24534 and
above complete suppression of outgrowth was observed. Depending on achievable plasma
levels, our data suggest that AP24534 may have the potential to overcome single-mutationbased resistance in the clinical setting. This result has been previously achieved in this assay
only with combinations of nilotinib or dasatinib and a pre-clinical T315I inhibitor (O’Hare et
al., 2008). To our knowledge no other ABL kinase inhibitor has been shown to have this
potential as a single agent.
As compound (multiple) mutations of BCR-ABL represent a rare but challenging scenario
clinically, we carried out additional accelerated mutagenesis screens starting with cells
expressing either of the two individually most resistant mutants, BCR-ABLT315I or BCRABLE255V. This predictive assay implicated certain compound mutations, especially those
involving any two of Y253H, E255V, and T315I in moderate to high-level resistance to
AP24534. Among these, Y253H/T315I and E255V/T315I are predicted to be the most resistant
pairings, although high concentrations of AP24534 still prevented these mutations emerging.
Thus, AP24534 has the capability to eliminate compound mutations involving T315I and
E255V predicted to be highly resistant to all other inhibitors. Currently, the number of clinically

documented compound mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL associated with
treatment failure is low (Table S5). Nonetheless, they represent a formidable problem for those
patients harboring them, and incidence may increase with the prolonged survival of CML
patients and with more patients undergoing sequential ABL kinase inhibitor treatment (Shah
et al., 2007). Overall, although no mutagenesis screen can be completely exhaustive, our data
indicate AP24534 has the potential to address this currently unmet clinical issue.
Our pre-clinical profiling indicates that AP24534 has potential as an important option for
controlling resistance in CML. The combined results of our biochemical, cell-based, and in
vivo studies suggest that AP24534 exhibits sufficient activity against native BCR-ABL and
all tested BCR-ABL mutants to warrant consideration for single-agent use as a pan-BCR-ABL
inhibitor. Moreover, our results indicate that AP24534 holds promise for controlling compound
mutants involving T315I, while raising awareness that it is advantageous to eliminate resistant
subclones at the single-mutation stage. In the longer term, this may advocate for the potential
future use of a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor such as AP24534 in a first-line therapeutic capacity.
Clinical use of a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor active against T315I could make long-term
remissions an achievable goal at least for some patients with advanced CML. A phase 1 clinical
trial evaluating oral AP24534 in patients with refractory CML and other hematologic
malignancies is ongoing (NCT00660920, www.clinicaltrials.gov).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Inhibitors
AP24534, 3-(imidazo[1,2b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-(4-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)
methyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)benzamide was synthesized at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals.
Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib were purchased from the Oregon Health & Science University
(OHSU) pharmacy or made at ARIAD. All inhibitors were prepared as 10.0 mM stock solutions
and stored at −20°C. Serial dilutions of 10.0 mM stock solutions were carried out just prior to
use in each experiment.
Crystallization and Structural Determination of ABLT315I:AP24534 Complex
The kinase domain of murine ABLT315I (residues 229–515) was co-expressed with YopH
protein tyrosine phosphatase in E. coli as described (Zhou et al., 2007) and purified in the
presence of AP24534 to near homogeneity (> 95%) using metal affinity, Mono Q, and size
exclusion chromatography. The typical yield of purified ABLT315I bound with AP24534 was
about 1 mg/L.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Co-crystals of ABLT315I and AP24534 were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method
at 4oC by mixing equal volumes of the AP24534:ABLT315I complex (25 mg/mL) and well
solution (30% w/v polyethylene 4000, 0.2 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5). After 1–2
days, crystals reached a typical size of 50 × 50 × 300 μm3 and were harvested in mother liquor
supplemented with 30% v/v glycerol as cyroprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected
at 100K at beamline 19 BM (Advanced Photon Service, Argonne, IL). The data were indexed
and scaled in space group P21 by using the HKL2000 package (Otwinowski and Minor,
1997).
The structure of AP24534 in complex with ABLT315I was determined by molecular
replacement by AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using the structure of native ABL bound with imatinib
(PDB code: 1IEP). There were two ABLT315I molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure
was refined with CNX combined with manual rebuilding in Quanta (Accelrys Inc., San Diego,
CA), and AP24534 was built into the density after several cycles of refinement and model
building, which then continued until convergence was reached. The final model, refined to

1.95 Å, consists of residues 228 through 511, with 386–397 in the activation loop disordered.
The electron density for bound AP24534 as well as the side chain of I315 was well resolved
in both complexes, leaving no ambiguities for the binding mode of the inhibitor.

Autophosphorylation Assays For ABLT315I
Kinase autophosphorylation assays with full length, tyrosine-dephosphorylated ABL,
ABLG250E, ABLY253F, ABLE255K and ABLT315I (Invitrogen; San Diego, CA) were performed
in the presence of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or AP24534 (0–1000 nM) as per (O’Hare et
al., 2004).
Kinase Selectivity Profile of AP24534
AP24534 was profiled against >100 kinases by Reaction Biology Corporation (Malvern, PA)
using the Kinase Hotspot assay, which utilizes 10 μM [33P]-ATP, recombinant kinase domain,
peptide substrate, and a range of 10 concentrations of inhibitor to establish an IC50 value
(http://www.reactionbiology.com/pages/kinase.htm).
Collection of Patient Samples
Clinical samples were obtained with informed consent and under the approval of the OHSU
Institutional Review Board. Blood or bone marrow from patients or healthy individuals was
separated on a Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare) for isolation of mononuclear cells.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cell Lines
Ba/F3 transfectants (expressing native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL with a single kinase domain
mutation) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 unit/mL penicillin
G, and 1 mg/mL streptomycin (complete media) at 37°C and 5% CO2. The Ba/F3 BCRABLT315A cell line was a kind gift of Dr. Neil Shah, UCSF. Parental Ba/F3 cells (and as a
control, Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells) were supplemented with IL-3 provided by WEHIconditioned media. Prior to cell proliferation assays, RNA was isolated from each Ba/F3 cell
line, and kinase domain mutations were confirmed by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequence
analysis using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics, State College, PA).
Cell Proliferation Assays

HHMI Author Manuscript

Ba/F3 cell lines were distributed in 96-well plates (4 × 103 cells/well) and incubated with
escalating concentrations of AP24534 for 72 hr. The inhibitor ranges used were: 0–625 nM for
cells expressing BCR-ABL and 0–10,000 nM for BCR-ABL negative cells. Proliferation was
measured using a methanethiosulfonate (MTS)-based viability assay (CellTiter96 Aqueous
One Solution; Promega). IC50 values are reported as the mean of three independent experiments
performed in quadruplicate. For cell proliferation experiments with CML or normal primary
cells, mononuclear cells were plated in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) over graded
concentrations of AP24534 (0–1000 nM) in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine,
penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Following a 72 hr incubation, cell
viability was assessed by subjecting cells to an MTS assay. All values were normalized to the
control wells with no drug.
CrkL Phosphorylation in Ba/F3 Cell Lines
Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I (5 × 106 per well) were cultured
4 hr in complete media alone or with imatinib (2000 nM), dasatinib (50 nM), nilotinib (500
nM), or AP24534 (0.1–1000 nM). Lysates produced by boiling cells in SDS-PAGE loading
buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were subjected to SDSPAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CrkL antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz). Phosphorylated and

Ex Vivo Exposure of BCR-ABLT315I Patient Samples to AP24534
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with CML in lymphoid blast crisis (CML
L-BC) with a BCR-ABLT315I mutation were isolated by Ficoll centrifugation. RT-PCR and
sequencing analysis confirmed that the sample predominantly contained the BCR-ABLT315I
mutant. Mononuclear cells (5 × 106 cells/well) were cultured overnight in serum-free IMDM
media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% BIT (StemCell), 40 μg/mL human low-density
lipoprotein, and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol alone or with imatinib (1000 nM), dasatinib (50
nM), nilotinib (200 nM), or AP24534 (50 nM, 500 nM). Cells were lysed directly into boiling
SDS-PAGE loading buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CrkL antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz).
Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CrkL were distinguished based on differential band
migration. Band signal intensities were quantified by densitometry on a Lumi Imager (Roche).
Global Tyrosine Phosphorylation by FACS

HHMI Author Manuscript

Mononuclear cells (2 × 105) were cultured overnight in serum-free media alone or with imatinib
(1000 nM), dasatinib (50 nM), nilotinib (200 nM), or graded concentrations of AP24534 (50,
500 nM). Cells were fixed and permeabilized according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Caltag), incubated with 2 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences)
for 1 hr, washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide, and
fixed in 1% formaldehyde. FITC signal intensity was analyzed on a FACSAria instrument
(BD) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated. Values are reported as fold
increase in MFI relative to unstained controls.
Hematopoietic Colony Forming Assays of Primary CML Cells and Normal Bone Marrow

HHMI Author Manuscript

To assess the effect of AP24534 against primary CML cells harboring BCR-ABLT315I and
normal hematopoietic progenitors, bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated by Ficoll density
centrifugation were cultured with graded concentrations of AP24534 (CML patient: 0–50 nM;
healthy individual: 0–1000 nM). Cells were plated in triplicate (5×104 cells/plate) in 1 mL of
IMDM:methylcellulose media (1:9 v/v) containing 50 ng/mL SCF, 10 ng/mL GM-CSF, and
10 ng/mL IL-3 (Methocult GF H4534; Stem Cell Technologies) to assess granulocyte/
macrophage colony formation (CFU-GM). After culturing at 37°C for 14–18 days, colonies
(>50 cells) were counted and results reported as the percentage of colonies relative to untreated
control ± SEM.
Pharmacokinetics
All animal experiments were approved by ARIAD’s IACUC and conformed to relevant
regulatory standards. The pharmacokinetic profile of AP24534 (in citrate buffer, pH 2.74) was
assessed in CD-1 female mice after a single dose by oral gavage. Blood samples were collected
at various time points and AP24534 concentrations in plasma determined by an internal
standard LC/MS/MS method using protein precipitation and calibration standards prepared in
blank mouse plasma. Reported concentrations are average values from 3-mice/time point/dose
group.
Ba/F3 survival model
Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I were injected into the tail vein of
female SCID mice (100 μL of a 1×107 cells/mL suspension in serum-free medium). Beginning
72 hr later mice were treated once daily by oral gavage with vehicle (25 mM citrate buffer, pH

2.75), AP24534, or dasatinib for up to 19 consecutive days. Moribund animals were sacrificed
as per IACUC guidelines. On necropsy, mice had marked splenomegaly due to tumor cell
infiltration. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical
significance was evaluated with a Log-rank test (GraphPad PRISM) comparing the survival
time of each treatment group with the vehicle group.
Ba/F3 Tumor Model
Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of female nude
mice (100 μL of a 1×107 cells/mL cell suspension in serum-free medium). Mice were
randomized to treatment groups when the average tumor volume reached approximately 500
mm3. Mice were treated once daily by oral gavage with vehicle (25 mM citrate buffer, pH 2.75)
or AP24534 for up to 19 consecutive days. Tumor volume (mm3) was calculated using the
following formula: tumor volume = L×W2×0.5. To determine tumor growth inhibition when
the treatment period was finished, mean tumor volume for treatment group/mean tumor volume
for control group (%T/C) was calculated at the final measurement. The mean tumor volume
from the last measurement of all groups was compared using a one-way ANOVA test
(GraphPad PRISM) and each treatment group was further compared to that of vehicle-treated
mice for statistical significance using Dunnett’s test.

HHMI Author Manuscript

For analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated BCR-ABL and CrkL levels, tumor-bearing animals
were treated with a single dose of vehicle or 30 mg/kg AP24534 by oral gavage. Six hr after
dosing, animals (N=3/group) were sacrificed and tumor samples collected for immunoblot
analysis with antibodies against pBCR-ABL and eIF4E (Cell Signaling Technology) and total
CrkL (C-20; Santa Cruz).
Accelerated cell-based mutagenesis screen: Single-agent AP24534

HHMI Author Manuscript

Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL were treated overnight with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENU; 50 μg/mL), pelleted, resuspended in fresh media, and distributed into 96-well plates at
a density of 1×105 cells/well in 200 μL complete media supplemented with graded
concentrations of AP24534. The wells were observed for cell growth under an inverted
microscope and media color change every two days throughout the 28-day experiment. The
contents of wells exhibiting cell outgrowth were transferred to a 24-well plate containing 2 mL
complete media supplemented with AP24534 at the same concentration as in the initial 96well plate. If growth was simultaneously observed in all wells of a given condition, 24
representative wells were expanded for further analysis. At confluency, cells in 24-well plates
were collected by centrifugation. DNA was extracted from the cell pellets using a DNEasy
Tissue kit (QIAGEN). The BCR-ABL kinase domain was amplified using primers B2A (5′
TTCAGAAGCTTCTCCCTGACAT 3′) and ABL4317R (5′ AGCTCTCCTGGAGGTCCTC
3′), PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced by a commercial contractor (Agencourt
Bioscience) using primers ABL3335F (5′-ACCACGCTCCATTATCCAGCC-3′) and
ABL4275R (5′-CCTGCAGCAAGGTAGTCA-3′), and the chromatograms were analyzed for
mutations using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics). Results from this screen are
reported as the cumulative data from three independent experiments (see Table S2). The
mutagenesis screen was also conducted as described above for single-agent AP24534 starting
with Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABLT315I (see Table S3) or BCR-ABLE255V (see Table S4)
in single independent experiments.

or BCR-ABLT315I

(A) Immunoblot analysis of CrkL phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL
treated with imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or AP24534. Cells were cultured for 4 hr with
inhibitors, harvested, lysed, and analyzed by immunoblot using an antibody for CrkL, a
substrate of BCR-ABL whose phosphorylation is an established clinical marker of BCR-ABL
kinase activity. Both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms are resolved by
electrophoretic mobility, and bands are quantitated by densitometry and expressed as a %
phosphorylated CrkL. (B) Immunoblot analysis of CrkL phosphorylation in Ba/F3 BCR-

Figure 5. AP24534 is Effective in Mouse Xenograft Models of BCR-ABL-Driven and BCRABLT315I-Driven Tumor Growth

(A) Effect of AP24534 on survival of SCID mice after intravenous injection of Ba/F3 cells
expressing native BCR-ABL (left) or BCR-ABLT315I (right). Ba/F3 cells expressing native
BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I were injected into the tail vein of SCID mice, and animals were
treated once daily by oral gavage with vehicle, AP24534, or dasatinib for the indicated dosing
period (days 3–21).
(B) In vivo efficacy and BCR-ABL signaling suppression by AP24534 in a subcutaneous
xenograft model using Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells. Tumor-bearing animals were treated once
daily by oral gavage with vehicle or the indicated doses of AP24534 for 19 consecutive days
(dosing period indicated) with mean tumor volume plotted (error bars represent S.E.M.). Each
AP24354 treatment group was compared to the vehicle group using Dunnett’s test, with
statistical significance (p<0.05) indicated by an asterisk. BCR-ABL and CrkL phosphorylation
were evaluated by immunoblot in animals treated with a single oral dose of vehicle or 30 mg/
kg AP24534 (N=3 per group).

Figure 6. Single-Agent AP24534 Completely Suppresses Resistant Outgrowth in Cell-Based
Mutagenesis Screens

HHMI Author Manuscript

(A) Resistant clones recovered from ENU-treated Ba/F3 cells starting from native BCR-ABL
cultured with graded concentrations of AP24534 (10, 20, 40 nM). Each bar represents the
relative percentage of the indicated BCR-ABL kinase domain mutant among recovered
subclones. Since the percentage of surviving resistant subclones and the concentration of
AP24534 are inversely related, a different number of sequenced subclones are represented in
the graph for each concentration of AP24534 (Table S2). The percent of wells surveyed that
contained outgrowth is indicated to the right of each graph.
(B) ENU-treated Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells were cultured with graded concentrations of
AP24534 (40, 80, 160, 320, 640 nM). Experiments and data analysis were performed as
described in panel (A). All recovered subclones contain T315I in addition to the secondary
mutation indicated on each graph.
