Abstract
Antiangiogenic strategies can be effective for cancer therapy, but like all therapies resistance poses a major
clinical challenge. Hypoxia and nutrient starvation select for aggressive qualities that may render tumors resistant
to antiangiogenic attack. Here, we show that hypoxia and nutrient starvation cooperate to drive tumor
aggressiveness through epigenetic regulation of the histone demethylase JMJD1A (JHDM2A; KDM3A). In cancer
cells rendered resistant to long-term hypoxia and nutrient starvation, we documented a stimulation of AKT
phosphorylation, cell morphologic changes, cell migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in
culture. These qualities associated in vivo with increased angiogenesis and inﬁltration of macrophages into tumor
tissues. Through expression microarray analysis, we identiﬁed a cluster of functional drivers such as VEGFA,
FGF18, and JMJD1A, the latter which was upregulated in vitro under conditions of hypoxia and nutrient starvation
and in vivo before activation of the angiogenic switch or the prerefractory phase of antiangiogenic therapy.
JMJD1A inhibition suppressed tumor growth by downregulating angiogenesis and macrophage inﬁltration, by
suppressing expression of FGF2, HGF, and ANG2. Notably, JMJD1A inhibition enhanced the antitumor effects of
the anti-VEGF compound bevacizumab and the VEGFR/KDR inhibitor sunitinib. Our results form the foundation
of a strategy to attack hypoxia- and nutrient starvation–resistant cancer cells as an approach to leverage
antiangiogenic treatments and limit resistance to them. Cancer Res; 73(10); 3019–28. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis
(1, 2). VEGFs and their receptors (VEGFR) are key regulatory
factors of angiogenesis (3, 4). Therefore, targeting the VEGF/
VEGFR pathways by antiangiogenesis is a clinically validated
anticancer treatment (5). Antiangiogenic therapies are, however, limited to certain types of cancer and may elicit malignant

progression and metastasis (6, 7). Thus, the molecular mechanism of eliminating resistant and refractory cancer cells by
using such antiangiogenic treatments needs to be elucidated.
Under such treatments tumor cells may be exposed to both
hypoxia and nutrient starvation. We previously reported that
hypoxic and nutrient-starved tumor microenvironment may
play a critical role in tumor aggression and the refractoriness to
the antiangiogenic treatments (8) and that affected host cells
resulted in secondary leukemia in murine cancer models (9) In
addition, we found that an epigenetic regulator, histone
demethylase JHDM1D, suppressed tumor growth by regulating
angiogenesis under nutrient starvation (10). Epigenetic regulation of angiogenesis under hypoxia and nutrient starvation
can be important for tumor progression and aggression, but its
mechanism has not yet been elucidated. The present study was
conducted to investigate the mechanism of tumor aggressiveness, and our ﬁndings show that histone demethylase
JMJD1A plays an important role in tumor progression under
hypoxia and nutrient starvation.

cancer cell line, HSML, was kindly provided by Dr. Kudoh
(Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan). Cells were maintained
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Nacalai
Tesque) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere, except HSML cells, which were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque). Nutrient deprivation
was conducted as previously described under hypoxia (Fig.

Figure 1. Hypoxia and nutrient starvation double-deprivation increases Akt phosphorylation, cellular migration and invasion, and anchorage-independent
tumor cell growth in vitro. A, schematic diagram of a hypoxia and nutrient starvation DDS cycle. Human cancer cells were cultured under hypoxia (pO2, 1%) and
nutrient starvation (1:100 ratio) for approximately 3 days and recovered by culturing under normoxia in 30% nutrition for 1 day and then 100% nutrition
for more than a day until 80% to 90% conﬂuence was achieved. This hypoxia and nutrient starvation cycle was conducted for 10 or more cycles. B,
ten cycles of DDS (DDS10) in HeLa and T98G cells induced a cell morphologic change from epithelial cobblestone–like cells to mesenchymal-like spindle cells.
C, DDS stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HeLa and T98G cells. D, DDS increased the cellular migration, which was examined using a wound-healing
assay. E, DDS increased cellular invasion into Matrigel migration chambers. F, DDS increased anchorage-independent tumor cell growth in HeLa and

migrated distance was assessed using 9 measurements at time
point. Wounded area was calculated using the following
equation: Wounded ﬁlled (%) ¼ [(wound width at 12 hours 
wound width at 0 hours)/wounded width at 0 hours]  100.
The experiments were carried out in triplicate. SEM was
calculated and analyzed using the unpaired, 2-sided Student
t test.
Invasion assay
Twenty microliters of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was added
to a Boyden chamber insert containing 8-mm pores (BD Falcon)
and solidiﬁed for 2 hours in 37 C. Then, 200 mL of DMEM
supplemented with 0.5% FBS containing 5  104 cells were
plated on the upper chamber, and 300 mL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was added in the lower chamber. Cells were
cultured for 8 to 48 hours depending on the cell types, and the
number of invasive cells was counted following staining with
crystal violet.
Colony formation assay
Cells were suspended in DMEM containing 0.6% methylcellulose (Wako) supplemented with 10% FBS and seeded into 6well plates at a density of 1  104 to 2.5  104 cells per well in
triplicate. After 7 to 10 days, anchorage-independent colonies
were counted using a microscope.
Western blotting
Cell lysates were applied to a 7.5% to 15% PAGE and
transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Invitrogen). The membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal
anti-JHDM2A antibody, anti-histone H3K9me1, anti-histone
H3K9me3, anti-histone H3, anti-Akt, anti-phosphorylated Akt,
or mouse monoclonal anti-histone H3K9me2 and anti-b-actin
antibody (1:1,000; Millipore), followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (GE
Healthcare). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (GE Healthcare) and images
were acquired using a luminescent image analyzer (LAS3000,
FujiFilm).
Gene expression analysis using real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Isogen
reagent (Nippon Gene), converted to cDNA by using the
Prime Script reverse transcriptase (Takara) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and used for quantitative real-time
PCR ampliﬁcation using SYBR Green (Takara; Supplementary Table S1).
Gene expression proﬁling and statistical analysis
Total RNA (5 mg) was converted to aminoallyl-modiﬁed
cDNA by random 6-mer and oligo(dT)-primed polymerization
using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (Takara), coupled to Nhydroxysuccinimidyl esters of Cy3 (Agilent), and then hybridized to a human Oligo Microarray slide (human G4110F,
Agilent) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Arrays were
scanned using a G2565BA Microarray Scanner System and
analyzed using the GeneSpring GX software (Tomy Digital
Biology).

Animal studies and tumor xenograft
Murine B16 or human HeLa or A673 cells (1  107) were
subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6J or C.B17/Icr-scidJcl
scid/scid mice, respectively. Mice were treated with i.v. injection of 1 to 10 mg/kg/wk intraperitoneally (i.p.) of either
human IgG or anti-VEGF antibody (Chugai-Roche) every 7
days starting on day 2. VEGFR inhibitor (sunitinib) was
solubilized in methylselrose and administrated orally at the
concentration of 40 mg/kg/d. To visualize the hypoxic region in
the tumor tissue, 60 mg/kg of pimonidazole was administrated
(i.p./i.v.) at 30 to 45 minutes before perfusion ﬁxation. Tumor
volume was measured, and the data were analyzed using the
Student t test. All animal care procedures were in accordance
with institutional guidelines approved by the University of
Tokyo and Tokyo Medical and Dental University.
Histological analysis and immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissues were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA),
embedded in parafﬁn, and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Freshly frozen or 4% PFA-ﬁxed tumor tissues were cut 14mm thick by using a Cryostat (Leica) and stained with hamster
anti-CD31 (BD Biosciences), rat anti-CD11b (BD Biosciences),
rat anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec), mouse monoclonal anti-aSMA1
(Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-pimonidazole (Cosmo
bio). The sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody and the nuclear-staining dye To-Pro-3 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and then analyzed using a confocal
microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad). We quantiﬁed the number of CD31þ/aSMA1þ blood vessels/pericytes in the total area
of the tumor. We analyzed 5 to 10 ﬁelds per sample (n ¼ 5) for
quantiﬁcation of blood vessel density (k pixels). We also
counted the number of CD11bþ and F4/80þ cells in the total
area of the tumor in 5 to 10 ﬁelds for each sample (n ¼ 5).
siRNA
siRNAs were designed against human JMJD1A and obtained
commercially (Invitrogen Life Technologies). In this study, 2
sequences of siRNAs were used against hJMJD1A, designated as
siRNA1 (AGAAGAAUUCAAGAGAUUCCGGAGG) and siRNA2
(AACACAUUCCAGUUGCUCUUAUUGU). Cells were transfected with JMJD1A siRNAs or negative (scramble) control
siRNA by using the Lipofectamine RNAi MAX transfection
reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The ability of the siRNA to inhibit
JMJD1A expression was assessed at 48 hours after transfection.

Results
Hypoxia and nutrient starvation accelerate tumor
aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy
To clarify whether the hypoxia and nutrient starvation
double-deprivation stress (DDS) stimulates tumor aggressiveness in human cancer cells, we used the well-known human
cancer cell lines HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) and T98G
(human glioblastoma). As previously reported, we developed
a cell culture system for maintaining these cells under DDS

(Fig. 1A; refs. 8, 9). HeLa and T98G cells were continuously
exposed to 10 cycles of DDS (HeLa-DDS10 and T98G-DDS10
cells). HeLa-DDS10 and T98G-DDS10 cells showed cell morphologic changes (Fig. 1B), increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig.
1C), cellular migration (Fig. 1D), invasion (Fig. 1E), and anchorage-independent cell growth (Fig. 1F) in vitro. To investigate
whether increased invasion is due, in part, to the high proliferation rate of DDS cells, we compared the cell proliferation
rates of untreated HeLa and T98G cells to the proliferation
rates of HeLa- and T98G-DDS10 cells. We found no signiﬁcant

difference in the rate of cell proliferation in HeLa and T98G
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that cell proliferation
rate was not responsible for the increased migration and
invasiveness of DDS cells (Fig. 1D and E). Notably, HeLa-DDS10
and T98G-DDS10 cells were less sensitive to conventional
chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel (Fig. 1G, Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 8). This ﬁnding suggests that hypoxia- and
nutrient starvation–resistant human cancer cells develop
tumor aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents.

2G and H), angiogenesis (Fig. 2I), and monocyte (Fig. 2J) and
macrophage inﬁltration (Supplementary Fig. S5) compared
with implantation with original B16 cells (11, 13). Notably,
blood vessel functionality and coverage of pericytes
(a-SMA1þ) on CD31þ blood vessels were not signiﬁcantly
different between control and DDS cells in vivo (Supplementary
Fig. S6). In addition, HeLa-DDS10 cells were still sensitive to
treatment with anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab; 5 mg/kg/
wk1 i.p.) in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus, cancer cells
survived under the DDS-stimulated tumorigenicity by regulation of tumor angiogenesis.
Hypoxia and nutrient starvation cooperatively induce
the epigenetic regulator JMJD1A
To determine the molecular targets against oxygen and
nutrition DDS–resistant cancer cells, we conducted a microarray analysis of 4 different human cancer cells (HeLa, HepG2,
A431, and T98G) that were subjected to hypoxia, nutrition
starvation, and DDS. We found that a cluster of DDS-responsive genes such as VEGF-A, FGF18, and jumonji domain-containing protein 1A (JMJD1A) was upregulated in cancer cells
(Fig. 3A–C, Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig.
S8). Histone demethylase JMJD1A was upregulated under DDS
in both murine and human cancer cells (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table S3) and the upregulation prominently increased
following long-term exposure to DDS (48–72 hours; Fig. 3E). In
addition, JMJD1A expression was normalized by returning the

Cancer cells resistant to hypoxia and nutrient starvation
increased tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo
The extent of hypoxia and nutrient starvation in tumor
tissues following treatment with antiangiogenic agents was
examined by treating tumor-bearing immunodeﬁcient mice
with VEGF-neutralizing antibody (bevacizumab; 0–10 mg/kg/
wk i.p.), and the hypoxic- and nutrient-rich areas were visualized using anti-pimonidazol and a modiﬁed PAS, respectively. While tumor growth was signiﬁcantly suppressed after antiVEGF treatment (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S3A), hypoxic
(pimonidazolþ) and nutrient-starved (PAS) areas were
increased in tumor tissues in HeLa and A673 cells (Fig. 2B,
Supplementary Fig. S3B). In conclusion, hypoxia alone does not
affect cell proliferation, but hypoxia and nutrient starvation
cooperatively suppressed the cell proliferation of cancer cells
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To investigate whether cancer cells resistant to hypoxia and
nutrient starvation stimulate tumorigenicity, we subcutaneously inoculated 1  107 of original HeLa and HeLa-DDS10 cells
in scid/scid mice. HeLa-DDS10 cells showed increased initial
tumor growth (Fig. 2C and D), increased CD31þ vascular
formation (Fig. 2E), and inﬁltration of CD11bþ monocytes
(Fig. 2F) and F4/80þ macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S5),
suggesting a contribution of tumor-associated monocytes/
macrophages (TAM; refs. (11, 12). In addition, orthotopic
transplantation of B16-DDS10 cells in immunoproﬁcient mice
showed a signiﬁcant increase in the initial tumor growth (Fig.

Figure 4. JMJD1A was signiﬁcantly upregulated at the angiogenic switch
and the prerefractory phase of antiangiogenesis. A–C, JMJD1A was
highly expressed in avascular tumor tissues at angiogenic switch. The
angiogenic switch occurs between days 2 and 4 in a transplanted tumor
þ
of HSML cells determined by immunohistochemical staining of CD31
blood vessels in the tumor tissue, whereas the mRNA expression of
Jmjd1A was increased in avascular tumor tissues on day 2 ( , P < 0.01). A
total of 1  107 of HSML cells were subcutaneously injected to C57BL6J
mice (n ¼ 3 per time point). Quantitative PCR was carried out using RNA
from tumors at days 2 and 4. The source of values at day 0 was taken from
tumors before implantation (B, border of tumor; T, tumor). D and E,

culture conditions back to normal (10% FBS with DMEM) in
vitro (Supplementary Fig. S9). Notably, JMJD1A mRNA expression was upregulated in tumor tissues at the preangiogenic
switch in HSML cells (Fig. 4A–C) and B16 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S10) and at the refractory phase of anti-VEGF treatment
(Fig. 4D and E), suggesting that JMJD1A may play an important
role in tumor progression under DDS.
Inhibition of JMJD1A suppresses tumor growth and
angiogenesis, sensitizing cancer cells to VEGF and
VEGFR inhibitors
To investigate the role of JMJD1A in tumor progression, we
silenced JMJD1A in HeLa and A673 cells by using siRNAs (Fig.

5A). We chose these cell lines because previous work has shown
that these cells can grow as xenografts in scid/scid mice (14)
whereas T98G cells cannot (9). In addition, because A673 cells
have been shown to be sensitive to anti-VEGF antibody treatment (15), we examined the tumorigenicity of HeLa and A673
cells following treatment with antiangiogenic agents. JMJD1A
inhibition showed a minor effect on cell proliferation under
hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and DDS (Supplementary Fig.
S11), as well as anchorage-independent tumor cell growth in
HeLa and A673 cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S12). JMJD1A
inhibition slightly decreased cell migration and invasion in
vitro (Supplementary Figs. S13 and S14).
To investigate the role of JMJD1A in tumor growth in vivo,
we subcutaneously inoculated 1  107 of JMJD1A-silenced
HeLa and A673 cells in scid/scid mice (n ¼ 5). JMJD1A
inhibition signiﬁcantly suppressed HeLa and A673 cell
tumorigenicity in vivo (Fig. 5B). The siRNAs against JMJD1A
effectively suppressed JMJD1A expression for 8 days in HeLa
and A673 cells (Supplementary Fig. S15), resulting in an
overall reduction of tumor growth in vivo for longer than
8 days (Fig. 5B). In contrast, overexpression of JMJD1A
signiﬁcantly promoted initial tumor growth in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S16).
We next investigated whether DDS cells are sensitive to
siRNA-mediated knockdown of JMJD1A in vivo. Because HeLaDDS10 cells were more tumorigenic than the original HeLa
cells (Fig. 2D), HeLa-DDS10 cells were more sensitive to siRNA
against JMJD1A than the original HeLa-cells (Supplementary
Fig. S17).
To clarify the tumor-suppressive role following JMJD1A
inhibition, we examined the immunohistochemical staining
of tumor angiogenesis and the inﬁltration of TAM linage cells
in the tumor tissues of A673 cell–transplanted mice. CD31þ
vascular formation (Fig. 5C and D) and inﬁltration of CD11bþ
macrophage lineage cells (Fig. 5C and E) were signiﬁcantly
decreased in the tumor tissues under JMJD1A inhibition,
suggesting that JMJD1A participates in tumor angiogenesis
and the inﬁltration of TAMs.
To further investigate the antiangiogenic effects of JMJD1A
inhibition, we speciﬁcally examined the mRNA expression of
the tumor-secreted (human origin) and host-derived (mouse
origin) angiogenic factors in the tumor tissues of JMJD1Asilenced HeLa and A673 cells. The expression of tumor-derived
hFGF2, hHGF, and hAng2 and host-derived mAng2 were signiﬁcantly decreased by JMJD1A inhibition in the tumor tissues
of HeLa and A673 cells (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Table S1 and
Supplementary Fig. S18). Moreover, JMJD1A inhibition significantly increased the tumor-suppressive effects of the antiVEGF antibody treatment (bevacizumab) in both HeLa cells
(n ¼ 10; Fig. 6A) and A673 cells (Supplementary Fig. S19). In
addition, JMJD1A inhibition signiﬁcantly increased the tumorsuppressive effects of another antiangiogenic VEGFR inhibitor
(sunitinib) in vivo (n ¼ 10; Fig. 6B). We further examined the
mechanism of suppression of tumor angiogenesis by inhibition
of JMJD1A via microarray and gene ontology analysis following
siRNA against JMJD1A and/or anti-VEGF antibody treatment
(bevacizumab) in A673 cells. We found that inhibition of
JMJD1A speciﬁcally decreases expression of genes such as

Figure 5. JMJD1A inhibition suppressed tumor growth via downregulating angiogenesis in vivo. A and B, JMJD1A inhibition by siRNAs suppressed in vivo
tumor growth. Tumor volumes of the xenografts of JMJD1A-silenced HeLa and A673 cells were measured and compared with that of the controls ( , P < 0.05).
C–E, inhibition of JMJD1A decreased tumor angiogenesis and inﬁltration of macrophage cells and showed additive effects in combination with
þ
antiangiogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that JMJD1A inhibition decreased formation of CD31 blood vessels and inﬁltration of
CD11bþ cells in tumors ( , P < 0.05). F, expression of proangiogenic factors (Ang1, Ang2, and Hgf) in tumor tissues were decreased in siJMJD1A-treated tumor
examined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis ( , P < 0.05).

FGF2, CSF2, and S100A9 (Supplementary Table S4) related to
cell movement, leukocyte and myeloid cell migration, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S20). This
explains why an inhibition of JMJD1A by siRNAs can prevent
the inﬁltration of immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages into tumor tissue, resulting in decreased tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 5). Introducing epigenetic modiﬁcations in hypoxic and nutrient-starved cancer cells, such as by JMJD1A
inhibition, is an effective anticancer strategy for improving
antiangiogenesis (Fig. 7).

Discussion
Antiangiogenesis is a clinically validated cancer treatment
(5). However, the emergence of drug resistance and tumor
aggressiveness, partly due to an extreme tumor microenvironment, can be major clinical problems (6–9). In this study, we
investigated the mechanism underlying tumor aggressiveness
by using a model system of antiangiogenesis (8, 9). Oxygen and
nutrition deﬁciency stimulated cell migration, invasion (Fig. 1),
and tumorigenicity associated with increased tumor angio-

genesis and inﬁltration of TAMs (Fig. 2). We have shown that
histone demethylase JMJD1A, an epigenetic regulator, is highly
expressed in cancer cells in response to hypoxia and nutrient
starvation (Fig. 3) and that JMJD1A inhibition suppressed
tumor angiogenesis by downregulating ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF)2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and Ang2 and
resulted in signiﬁcant suppression of tumor growth and
improvement of anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) and
VEGFR inhibitor (sunitinib) treatment (Figs. 5 and 6). Taken
together, our results indicate that targeting cancer cell resistance to hypoxia and nutrient starvation can be a strategy for
overcoming resistance to antiangiogenic treatments.
Inhibition of angiogenesis suppresses the formation of
new tumor vasculature (5) and may normalize the vasculature,
resulting in increased efﬁcacy of the combination chemotherapy (16). We found that antiangiogenic treatments expanded
the hypoxic and nutrient-starved areas within the tumor
tissue (Fig. 2B) and that hypoxia- and nutrient starvation–
resistant cancer cells showed tumor aggressiveness such as
increased migration, invasion (Fig. 1), tumorigenicity, tumor

angiogenesis, and inﬁltration of tumor-associated monocytes
and macrophage cells, suggesting that DDS10 cells actively
recruit monocytes and macrophages (Fig. 2, Supplementary
Fig. S5). In addition, hypoxia- and nutrient starvation–resistant
cells became less sensitive to conventional chemotherapy (Fig.
1G; ref. 8), suggesting that cancer cell refractoriness following
antiangiogenic treatment (6, 7, 17, 18) could be due to resistance to the combinational chemotherapy, in addition to
activation of both tumor cells and associated cells (19). Thus,
combination chemotherapeutic regimens should be considered to perturb the DDS-resistant cancer cells and tumorassociated cells in combination with antiangiogenic treatment.
The adaptation of cancer cells to tumor microenvironments
involving oxygen or nutrient deﬁciencies, acidosis, and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) is required for tumor progression and
metastasis (20, 21). The oxygen or nutrient deﬁciency and
acidosis can be adapted by metabolic alterations to glycolysis
(Warburg effect), gluconeogenesis, and other pathways (22–
24). Although prokaryotic cells use a "stringent control" under

nutrient deﬁciencies by terminating cell proliferation while
synthesizing defective nutrient components (25, 26), the metabolic alteration can be achieved in mammalian cells via
transcriptional and epigenetic regulation (27). Epigenetic regulation of metastasis-related genes can also lead to resistance
to ROS (28). The "stringent control" of mammalian cells may
play important roles during nutrient starvation, but to date
there are no studies showing this. We previously reported that
histone demethylase JHDM1D is an essential epigenetic regulator in tumor progression under nutrient starvation by
angiogenesis downregulation (10). Interestingly, JMJD1A acts
as a pro-angiogenic regulator that promotes initiation of tumor
growth, whereas JHDM1D suppresses tumor growth, possibly
playing a role during the adaptation to both hypoxia and
nutrient starvation. Thus, epigenetic regulation under hypoxia
and nutrient starvation could also be essential for both tumor
aggressiveness and the shift in metabolism, but the control
mechanism underlying this has not yet been identiﬁed.
We identiﬁed that the histone demethylase JMJD1A is an
essential epigenetic regulator of tumor progression under
hypoxia and nutrient starvation. JMJD1A is involved in spermatogenic development (29), metabolism in obesity (30), and
hypoxic cancer cells under HIF1a regulation (31). Expression of
JMJD1A can be a poor prognostic maker in patients with
cancer (32). Loss of JMJD1A resulted in reduced proliferation
and invasiveness of human colon cancer cells in vitro, which
may lead to decreased tumor growth in vivo (32). In this study,
while JMJD1A signiﬁcantly decreased tumor growth in vivo
(Fig. 5), inhibition of JMJD1A showed only a minor effect on
proliferation and invasion of HeLa and A673 cells in vitro
(Supplementary Figs. S11 and S12). Therefore, we suggest that
JMJD1A alters the tumor microenvironment by affecting angiogenesis and TAMs.
However, the exact role of JMJD1A in tumor progression and
aggression has not been elucidated to date. JMJD1A inhibition
signiﬁcantly decreased tumor angiogenesis and macrophage
inﬁltration into tumor tissues (Fig. 5C–E). Although Ang1 and
Ang2 conduct antagonistic as well as agonistic functions on
the regulation of angiogenesis (33), expression of several

pro-angiogenic factors such as angiopoietins, FGFs. and HGF
was downregulated by JMJD1A inhibition within the tumor
tissues of HeLa and A673 cells (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Table S4
and Supplementary Fig. S18). Moreover, JMJD1A was signiﬁcantly upregulated at the angiogenic switch and the prerefractory phase of antiangiogenesis (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.
S10), suggesting the importance of JMJD1A at these stages.
Strikingly, JMJD1A inhibition delayed tumor growth in combination with anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) and anti-VEGFR
treatment (sunitinib); possibly, by affecting the refractory
phase of the tumor against antiangiogenesis (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. S19), suggesting that modiﬁcation of epigenetic
regulators can inﬂuence both cancer cells and tumor-associated cells.
Recently, small-molecule inhibitors targeting epigenetic
modulators have garnered much attention in the development
of cancer chemotherapy drugs. For example, DNA demethylase
inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine, commonly used in clinical cancer therapy (34). Many inhibitors of
histone modiﬁers such as Ezh2 are now in clinical trials. Thus,
it is possible that epigenetic modiﬁcation through inhibition
of JMJD1A can be a novel way to overcome the refractoriness
of tumors to antiangiogenic therapy. On the basis of our
results, therapies targeting cancer cells that are resistant to
hypoxic and nutrient-starved tumor microenvironments
can comprise an anticancer strategy for sensitizing cells antiangiogenic treatments and preventing tumor recurrence and
aggressiveness.
