BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive surgery (CS) and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (IPHC) can
improve outcomes for selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from colorectal cancer. The
presence of parenchymal hepatic metastases (HM) is considered a relative contraindication for CS and
IPHC. The purpose of the current study was to compare the overall survival of patients with HM to those
without and to examine predictive factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing CS and IPHC between 1991 and 2007. Clinicopathologic information was obtained from a prospectively collected database and electronic medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
performed to evaluate variables predictive for overall survival. RESULTS: There were 142 patients who
underwent CS and IPHC for PC from colorectal cancer, with 14 (9.9%) patients noted to have concurrent
HM. The median number and size of the liver lesions was 1 (range, 1-7 lesions) and 3.0 cm (range, 0.4 cm-12
cm), respectively. The median overall survival for patients with HM was 23.0 months. Two-year and 4-year
survival rates were 43.3% and 14.4%, respectively. Patients without HM had 2-year and 4-year survival rates
of 36.8% and 17.4%, respectively. Overall survival was not significantly different for patients with and without HM (log-rank P ¼ .39). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HM undergoing CS and IPHC for colorectal cancer
were found to have no significant difference in overall survival compared with those without HM. Most
patients had a single small lesion treated with a minor hepatic resection. Further study is indicated
to define which patients with HM benefit most from this multimodality approach. Cancer 2009;115:3427–

Peritoneal surface disease (PSD) results from intracavitary dissemination of tumor from a variety of primary
lesions. The prognosis of PSD from colorectal cancer is
poor.1 Among patients with digestive malignancies, PSD
represents 1 of the most common causes of death, with a
median overall survival (OS) that ranges between 3 and 6
months.2,3 In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,
current data indicate that multiagent systemic therapy
regimens can provide a median survival up to 24 months,
but with no long-term survivors.1
The treatment of patients with PSD is in evolution.
Surgical resection alone has not been demonstrated to be
effective for treatment of PSD, because the median survival after resection for PSD has been shown to vary from
0.7 to 6 months, depending on the origin of the primary
tumor.4 Local control of PSD with external beam radiation or brachytherapy has also failed to demonstrate efficacy.5 Likewise, systemic chemotherapy for PSD is
limited, because the plasma peritoneal barrier causes
decreased tissue levels of drug in the peritoneum. Moreover, many patients present with PSD after systemic
chemotherapy has already failed.6
A growing number of publications have demonstrated that a multimodality approach including cytoreductive surgery (CS) and intraperitoneal hyperthermic
chemotherapy (IPHC) can significantly improve survival
outcomes in patients with PSD from colorectal cancer.2,7,8 Patients undergoing complete resection of all
macroscopic disease with IPHC have been reported to
have a 5-year OS of 30%.9 However, despite a recent consensus statement published on the role of CS þ IPHC for
colorectal cancer, there is still controversy regarding the
role of this multimodality approach and which patients
are most appropriate candidates.10 There have been several studies examining prognostic factors predicting OS
after CS þ IPHC to help clarify patient selection. Characteristics such as bowel obstruction, malignant ascites,
poor performance status, and parenchymal hepatic metastases (HM) have been shown in several series to be independent predictors of decreased survival.2,11-13
The resection of isolated HM from colorectal cancer
is clearly accepted as the treatment providing the best
chance of long-term survival, and traditionally the presence of PSD has been considered a contraindication to
surgery. However, with the advent of new chemotherapeutic and biologic agents to treat microscopic disease
3428

and provide better symptom control as well as improved
surgical techniques and perioperative care, there has been
a trend toward more aggressive surgical approaches for
recurrent metastatic disease.
Several recent reports have indicated that patients
with synchronous PSD and HM can achieve similar outcomes from CS þ IPHC compared with patients with
PSD alone.2,11,12 This study reviewed our experience with
CS þ IPHC using mitomycin C (MMC) for patients
with synchronous PSD and HM from colorectal cancer. It
also compared the clinical outcomes of patients with PSD
only and examined baseline characteristics and prognostic
factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Comprehensive Cancer Center and institutional review board of
the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. This was
a retrospective study of patients undergoing CS þ IPHC
between 1991 and 2007. Clinicopathologic information
was obtained from a prospectively collected database and
electronic medical record.

Patient Selection Criteria
Patients were evaluated in the surgical oncology clinics
preoperatively. To be considered for CS þ IPHC,
patients needed to have malignant disease confined to the
abdominal cavity with normal organ function (serum creatinine <2 mg/dL alkaline phosphatase and serum aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase <3 times the
upper limit of normal, white blood cell count >4000/
mm3, and platelet count >100,000 mm3). With respect
to patients with PSD þ HM, CS þ IPHC was considered
on an individual basis in a multidisciplinary context.
Selection criteria considered age, functional status,
response to chemotherapy, tumor biology, size and number of HM, and the presence of distant metastases. In
some cases, parenchymal HM were discovered intraoperatively. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging
was obtained and pathology from the specimens acquired
at the time of CS was compared with preoperative pathology. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status was recorded for all patients in this
study.

Peritoneal Disease and Liver Metastases/Varban et al

Clinical and pathologic variables included basic
demographic information (age, sex, and race), history of
previous surgery or chemotherapy, presence of bowel
obstruction and/or malignant ascites, number and size of
liver metastases, resection status, number of blood transfusions required during surgery, and length of procedure.

Cytoreductive Surgery
Cytoreductive surgery involved removal of all macroscopic disease in involved organs, peritoneum, and associated tissues. Supracolic omentectomy was performed
routinely and peritonectomy was performed as indicated.
Tumor adherent to vital organs that could not be removed
was cytoreduced using the cavitational ultrasonic surgical
aspirator (CUSA, Valleylab, Boulder, Colo). HM were
removed by wedge resection, radiofrequency ablation
(RFA), and/or cryosurgery. Resection status was based on
the following classification system: R0, complete removal
of all visible tumor and negative cytologic findings or microscopic margins; R1, complete removal of all visible
tumor and positive postperfusion cytologic findings or
microscopic margins; R2a, minimal residual tumor, nodule(s) measuring 0.5 cm; R2b, macroscopic residual tumor, nodule >0.5 cm but 2 cm; R2c, extensive disease
remaining, nodules >2 cm.
Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic
Chemotherapy
IPHC involved passively cooling patients to a temperature
of 34 C to 35 C after the completion of CS. Peritoneal
perfusion inflow and outflow catheters were placed percutaneously, and temperature catheters were placed just outside the exit sites from the abdomen. The abdominal skin
incision was closed with a running cutaneous suture to
prevent leakage of perfusate. A perfusion circuit was established with 3 L of Ringer lactate, and flow rates of 600 to
1000 mL/min were obtained with a roller pump. The
circuit was managed by a perfusionist.
Through a heat exchanger, a target outflow temperature of 40.5 C was established, with a maximum inflow
temperature of 42.5 C. MMC was introduced into the
perfusion circuit once the target outflow temperature was
exceeded. The abdomen was then gently massaged for a
total of 120 minutes to improve drug distribution to all

peritoneal surfaces. The MMC dose allowed for concentrations >5 lg/mL in a 3-L circuit. To achieve this concentration, 30 mg of MMC was added to the perfusate at
the initiation of the IPHC; at 60 minutes, an additional
10 mg of MMC was added. Because of concerns regarding
potential toxic effects, for elderly patients, those with
extensive previous chemotherapy, those with poor performance status, and patients with extensive peritoneal
stripping during the operation, the MMC dose was
reduced to 30 mg total and/or perfusion time was reduced
to 60 or 90 minutes. At the completion of the IPHC, the
peritoneum was washed out with 3 L of lactated Ringer
solution, and the abdomen was reopened for removal of
perfusion catheters, completion of anastomoses or stomas
as indicated, and fascial closure.

Clinical Follow-up
Clinical follow-up occurred at 1 month, then at least every
6 months for up to 5 years, and annually thereafter. Laboratory tests included blood counts, liver functions, and tumor markers as indicated. Imaging studies included chest,
abdominal, and pelvic CT scans with oral and intravenous
contrast. Some patients were followed jointly with medical oncologists, and systemic chemotherapy was given at
their discretion.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were generated for baseline clinicopathologic variables, including means, medians, ranges,
and standard deviations for continuous data and frequencies and proportions for categoric data for patients with
and without HM. Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were
used to test differences between groups, except for number
of units transfused (Wilcoxon rank sum test) and ECOG
performance status (Cochran-Armitage trend test). OS
was calculated from the date of surgery to last known date
of follow-up or date of death. Estimates of survival were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank tests
were performed on demographic and pertinent clinicopathologic variables to determine their respective association with survival. Cox proportional hazards regression
was used to model clinicopathologic factors for OS. Analysis was performed comparing patients with and without
HM and also among HM patients only. A P value <.05

(9.9%) patients having concurrent HM. Patient demographics and baseline data for IPHC patients with and
without HM are presented in Table 1. The median follow-up was 14.6 months for all patients (with HM, 20.7
months; without HM, 13.4 months).
The median number and size of HM was 1 (range,
1-7) and 3.0 cm (range, 0.4 cm-12), respectively.

2 RFAs. Eleven patients had known hepatic metastases
before undergoing CS þ IPHC. Clinicopathologic variables comparing patients with known HM before surgery
with those at the time of surgery are presented in Table 2.

Overall Survival
The median OS for patients with HM was 23.0 months
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 12.7 months-37.0
months). Two-year and 4-year survival rates were 43.3%
(95% CI, 14.1%-70.0%) and 14.4% (95% CI, 0.8%45.7%), respectively. Patients without HM had 2-year
and 4-year survival rates of 36.8% (95% CI, 27.8%45.8%) and 17.4% (95% CI, 10.4%-25.8%), respecTable 2. Comparing Preoperative and Intraoperative HM

tively. These data are summarized in Table 3. Comparing
the OS for patients with and without HM yielded a logrank P of .39 and is depicted in Figure 1.
Predictors of OS
Univariate analysis of clinical and pathologic variables for
OS among patients with HM is presented in Table 4. No
predictors were found to be associated with lower OS at
the .05 level.
Morbidity and Mortality
Table 5 compares the morbidity and mortality of the
patients with and without HM who underwent CS þ
IPHC. Mortality was defined as postoperative death
directly attributable to the procedure that occurred during
the postoperative hospitalization or after discharge. Likewise, morbidity was defined as any complication that
occurred during the postoperative hospital stay or after
discharge. Among patients with HM, there was 1 postoperative death attributed to respiratory failure secondary to
pneumonia (7.1% mortality). Postoperative complications included 1 case of each of the following: sepsis,
pneumonia, bowel leak, ileus, deep venous thrombosis,
pancreatic fistula, neutropenia, and superficial wound
infection (57.1% postoperation complication rate). The
median operative time was 10 hours and ranged from 9 to
16 hours. The median number of blood transfusions was
1 U and ranged from 0 to 7 U. The median lengths of intensive care unit stay and total hospital stay were 1.5 days
and 10 days, respectively. There was no significant difference in morbidity (P ¼ .61) or mortality (P ¼ .62) when
comparing the PSD and PSD þ HM groups.
Among patients with HM, 11 patients were known
to have HM before IPHC, whereas 3 patients were found

Over the past 10 years, publications regarding the utility
of CS þ IPHC in patients with PSD from colorectal cancer have illuminated the therapeutic efficacy of this multimodality approach. In a consensus statement on the
management of PSD from colonic origin by CS þ IPHC,
Esquivel et al reviewed clinical outcomes from the most
recent literature. These demonstrated that median survival time ranged between 13 and 60 months, and overall
2-year and 5-year survival rates were 22% to 73% and
11% to 32%, respectively.10 Although resection status is 1
of the strongest predictors of survival, appropriate patient

selection and prognostic factors are still in evolution. Independent predictors of decreased survival among
patients undergoing CS þ IPHC for nonappendiceal
colorectal cancer were analyzed by Shen et al in an earlier
report from our institution. These included poor performance status, bowel obstruction, malignant ascites,
and incomplete resection of macroscopic disease. In that
analysis, the presence of parenchymal HM was found on
univariate analysis to be a predictor of poor survival.13
PSD is reported in 13% of all patients with colorectal cancer and in 25% of patients with recurrent disease.14-17 The liver is also a frequent site of metastasis,
because the portal vein is the principal drainage of the
large intestine. Approximately 35% to 55% of patients
with colorectal cancer develop HM during the course of
their disease.18 In contrast to PSD, there is a preponderance of evidence that supports a significant survival benefit to resection of HM in the setting of colon cancer. The
overall 5-year survival rates reported after hepatic resection with curative intent range from 35% to 58%.18
Resection of isolated disease could potentially prevent further dissemination of tumor, because the liver is often
considered the first site of metastases. Similarly, PSD

spreads by direct extension into the peritoneal cavity, and
therefore complete resection of all macroscopic tumor
may have the same oncologic benefit as in HM. The challenge of PSD is that the more varied anatomic distributions compiled with the lack of precise perioperative
imaging makes complete resection more difficult. Here is
where the application of IPHC may help to treat microscopic residual disease left behind after CS. The combination of a complete cytoreduction in the liver and
peritoneal cavity plus IPHC may still provide an improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with low-volume
hepatic disease.
Reports by Kianmanesh et al, Carmignani et al, and
Elias et al2,11,12 indicated that the presence of HM does
not adversely affect survival in patients who have undergone CS þ IPHC. Elias et al12 demonstrated that treatment of PSD þ HM by CS þ IPHC was shown to be
beneficial in select patients presenting with 2 metastases.
The 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates were
41.5% and 23.6%, respectively.12 The only significant
prognostic factor for decreased survival was having 3
HMs. Their study included 24 patients total, all of whom
had known HMs before surgery. Partial hepatectomy
with intermittent vascular exclusion was performed for all
detectable liver lesions. RFA was also used for small-sized
central HMs.12
Kianmanesh et al2 also stated that the presence of resectable HM does not contraindicate the prospect of a survival benefit in patients with synchronous PSD. In their
study, 43 patients with PSD of colorectal origin underwent CS þ IPHC. The median survival was 38.4 months.
Of the 43 patients, 16 patients had HM and underwent
concomitant liver resections along with CS þ IPHC. The
median OS for this group was 36 months. Their study
demonstrated that survival rates were not significantly different between patients who had CS þ IPHC for PSD
alone versus those who had associated HM resection.2 In
their study, minor HMs were resected by tumorectomies
or segmentectomies at the time of surgery. Larger hepatic
metastases requiring hepatectomies were performed several months later. No data were given on the size and
number of HMs, and the only significant prognostic factor was status of resection.
The management of synchronous PSD and hematogenous metastasis from colorectal cancer was also studied by Carmignani et al.11 Their study included 27
3433

Original Article

patients with PSD from colorectal origins with concomitant distant metastases. Among those with distant metastases, 16 had HMs. Location of other metastases included
lung and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Hepatectomy
occurred at the time CS was performed, but the size and
number of metastases was not included. The median survival for all patients with distant metastases was 15.2
months, and as with Kianmanesh et al,11 patients with
complete CS had a significant improvement in survival.
Our data revealed a median OS of 23.0 months for
PSD þ HM and 15.8 months for PSD alone. Both PSD
þ HM and PSD alone had comparable baseline clinicopathologic variables that were not statistically significant
except for the presence of ascites. The presence of malignant ascites was significantly different between the PSD
and PSD þ HM groups (P ¼ .04). However, when comparing the median survival of patients with PSD þ HM
þ malignant ascities (20.8 months) with those with PSD
alone and no ascities (23.0 months), there was no significant difference noted (log-rank P ¼ .97). HM were also
typically small in size (median, 3 cm) and number (median, 1), and the majority were amenable to wedge resection, cryoablation, or RFA. However, because the
application of CS þ IPHC is not standardized, and
patient selection is not uniform, it is difficult to compare
our results with other institutions. For example, MMC
was used exclusively for IPHC at our institution, and in
the consensus statement by Esquivel et al,9 MMC is the
most commonly used drug. However, all 3 comparative
studies mentioned previously used either MMC, 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin either alone or in combination. In some cases, chemotherapy was instilled into the
peritoneum in the postoperative setting and was not
heated as with IPHC. Moreover, IPHC can also be performed in an open or closed method, further adding to
the variability of results among institutions.
When comparing the results of the current study
with those of a previous study by Shen et al13 of IPHC for
nonappendiceal colorectal cancer, we found an improved
median OS among patients with HM. Data collected up
to 2002 demonstrated HM to be predictive of decreased
OS on univariate analysis, with a median OS of 12.7
months, although it was not found to be significant on
multivariate analysis.13 The current study includes data up
to 2007, with the addition of 7 patients with HM. With
these new data, we noted an improved median OS of 23.0
3434

months. The exact reason is not clear. The addition of new
systemic chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, and cetuximab may have played a
role in extending survival. After reviewing our data, 93%
of patients with HM undergoing IPHC þ CS had preoperative chemotherapy, and 67% had postoperative chemotherapy. Among patients with PSD alone, the majority
(72%) had postoperative chemotherapy.
Reported series show that CS þ IPHC carry high
morbidity and mortality rates that range 14% to 55% and
0% to 19%, respectively.1,10,19-23 In the current series, the
postoperative morbidity was 57.1% among patients with
HM and 40.1% among patients without HM. Collectively, the most common complications included neutropenia, sepsis, pneumonia, bowel leak, and wound
infection. Mortality among both HM and non-HM
groups was most commonly attributable to sepsis and respiratory failure. Although this morbidity and mortality
compares favorably with other published series, it is still
substantial for any surgical procedure. In the current series, we defined morbidity and mortality as complications
and deaths directly related to CS þ IPHC; it is not
bounded by a 30-day interval or postoperative hospitalization. It should also be noted that the surgical treatment of
HM did not significantly increase the surgical complication rate for this procedure.
The results of the current study do not demonstrate
significant predictive factors for OS. Resection status for
PSD failed to demonstrate statistical significance for
improved outcome, as described by previous studies. This
may be due in part to the small sample size of the PSD þ
HM group. In our study, 9 patients achieved an R0 or R1
resection, whereas 5 patients had an R2a resection, with
highly variable outcomes (OS between 1.4 months and
36.9 months). Of note, resection status for PSD is
reported separately from liver resections. In our study, disease-free margins for liver resections were obtained in
67% of patients undergoing wedge resection or hepatectomy. All patients who underwent cryotherapy and RFA
demonstrated CT evidence of recurrence on follow-up
imaging. After 2002, the data indicated that the majority
of HM were treated with wedge resection (78%), and if
the HM was known before CS þ IPHC, all had negative
margins for disease. Thus, improved techniques for liver
resection may have contributed to the improved outcomes
at our institution since 2002.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature as well as the small number of patients in the PSD þ
HM group. Because this was not a prospective clinical
trial, it was not powered a priori to detect a certain effect
size. When large variability in patient outcomes are
observed in small sample sizes, OS may be skewed. Moreover, this may have also contributed to a lack of significance in prognostic indicators within our univariate
analysis. Despite the small number of patients in the PSD
þ HM group, the addition of 7 patients between 2002
and 2007 improved OS from 12.7 to 23.0 months. At the
same time, when comparing the non-HM group from our
previous study (N ¼ 77) with that of our current study (N
¼ 128), we observed the same median OS of 15 months,
indicating a level of consistency in our outcomes.
With regard to the method of hepatic tumor control, such as wedge resection, segmentectomy, hepatectomy, cryosurgery, or RFA, the choice depended on the
tumor burden, location of HM, and available technology.
Small HM located on the periphery of the liver would be
amenable to wedge resection. Larger metastases that are
localized may require a segmentectomy or hepatectomy.
Likewise, metastases that abut the inferior vena cava or are
located in multiple segments are more safely managed by
cryosurgery or RFA. In reviewing the data, it appears that
the choice of cryosurgery versus RFA was dictated by the
date of the surgery and the available technology at the
time. For example, cryosurgery was performed during
1994 through 1996, whereas RFA was performed during
2003 through 2005. All patients who underwent CS þ
IPHC were free of abnormal hepatic function, cirrhosis,
or hepatitis, as determined by normal hepatic function
tests and coagulation studies. We acknowledge the finding
that resection is fundamentally different from cryosurgery
and RFA; however, all represent methods of tumor control that when compared, demonstrated no difference in
terms of outcomes in this series. After performing a multivariate analysis comparing cryosurgery/RFA (n ¼ 6) to
resection (n ¼ 8), no differences were found with respect
to OS (log-rank P value ¼ .71) or in the number of HM
(P ¼ .38) or size of the HM (P ¼ .14). The median OS
for the cryosurgery/RFA patients was 23.0 months versus
22.7 months for resection patients.
Despite the lack of prognostic indicators to guide
our approach to CS þ IPHC for patients with PSD þ
HM, our current patient selection strategy carefully conCancer

siders age, functional status, response to chemotherapy, tumor biology, number and size of HM, and presence of
distant metastases. Younger patients may benefit from
more aggressive treatments, which may offer longer OS.
Among patients in this study, 80% of patients had an
ECOG score of 0 or 1, because patients with a better functional status are more likely to tolerate longer surgeries and
the side effects of chemotherapy. Patients with stable or
improved disease burden after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
are considered to have favorable tumor biology that may
have a better response to IPHC, as concentrations of
chemotherapy to PSD will be higher during IPHC. With
regard to tumor burden to the liver, patients ought to have
a small number and size of HM, so they may be amenable
to either complete resection or ablation. Although R0
resection status is the primary goal of CS, it is often difficult to predict the extent of disease in the preoperative
setting by CT imaging alone. The presence of distant metastases, however, such as in the brain or lung, does not
favor a complete therapeutic response to CS þ IPHC.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that similar OS rates are
observed among PSD patients with HM when compared
with those without HM. Patients with PSD þ synchronous HM undergoing CS þ IPHC for colorectal cancer
had no significant difference in OS or morbidity compared with those with PSD alone. Most patients had a single small lesion treated with a minor hepatic resection or
ablative therapy. Patients with PSD from colorectal cancer
and low-volume HM may derive benefit from CS þ
IPHC if all disease can be completely resected. These
patients should be referred to a peritoneal surface malignancy center for multidisciplinary evaluation. Prospective
studies are needed to clarify patient selection and determine which patients benefit most from this multimodality
approach.
