BACKGROUND: A significant improvement in overall survival (OS) was demonstrated in patients with advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received sorafenib (Sor) in the Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol
(SHARP) study, in contrast to a response rate (RR) of 2% assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST). Modified RECIST (mRECIST) were developed to assess the response in patients with HCC, based on
measurement of viable tumor with arterial enhancement on a computed tomography (CT) scan. In the current study,
mRECIST were evaluated and were compared with RECIST in patients who received Sor for advanced HCC. METHODS:
The authors retrospectively analyzed 53 patients who received Sor for advanced HCC. Patients must to have undergone a 4-phase CT scan before treatment and repeatedly thereafter. CT scans were analyzed using RECIST 1.1 and
mRECIST. RESULTS: The rates of objective response (OR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) were
2%, 79%, and 19%, respectively, according to RECIST and 23%, 57%, and 21%, respectively, according to mRECIST (P <
.001). Patients who achieved an OR according to mRECIST had a longer OS than nonresponding patients with SD or
PD (median OS, 18 months and 8 months, respectively; P ¼ .013). In the 42 patients who achieved SD according to
RECIST, OS differed depending on tumor response according to mRECIST, with a median OS of 17 months, 10 months,
and 4 months for patients who achieved an OR (n ¼ 11), SD (n ¼ 29), and PD (n ¼ 2), respectively (P ¼ .016). CONCLUSIONS: The current series validated mRECIST in patients who received Sor for advanced HCC. The majority of
patients who had SD according to RECIST had a different prognosis according to mRECIST. The results indicated
that, for patients with HCC, mRECIST should be used for the standard assessment of treatment efficacy, particularly

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death from cancer worldwide1; and, at the time of
diagnosis, most patients have advanced stage disease. Therapeutic modalities for patients with advanced stage HCC were
very limited until results from the Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial were published.2
That trial tested the efficacy of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits certain tyrosine kinases (vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor [VEGFR], platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR], c-Kit) and raf serine/threonine kinase,3,4 compared with placebo in 602 patients with advanced stage HCC. Despite a disappointing 2% response rate
(RR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), sorafenib demonstrated a significant
improvement in overall survival (OS) (median OS increased from 7.9 months to 10.7 months) and in the median time
to radiologic progression (from 2.8 months to 5.5 months). In a confirmatory phase 3 study conducted in Asia (the

Asia-Pacific [AP] trial) that included 271 patients, similar
improvements in OS and the time to progression were
observed, also contrasting with a low RR (3.3%).5 Moreover, in the SHARP trial, there was no difference in RR
between sorafenib and placebo with regard to response or
stable disease (SD) according to RECIST in 2% and 71%
of patients, respectively, versus 1% and 67% of patients,
respectively. In clinical practice, this absence of any clear
sign of therapeutic efficacy can be a problem, particularly
in patients who are experiencing toxic adverse effects. It
also may be a major problem when second-line treatments
become available. Such results also could be problematic
in the context of a phase 2 trial, potentially leading to a
halt in the development of active drugs. These discrepancies and other difficulties in assessing response to locoregional treatments for HCC (percutaneous tumor ablation
or transarterial chemoembolization) have led to a recent
revision of evaluation criteria. Since the European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL) consensus conference
on HCC in 2000,6 it has been pointed out that vascularization of a lesion is the crucial key to evaluate response to
HCC treatment. Subsequently, an adaptation of
RECIST, termed modified RECIST (mRECIST), was
designed specifically for HCC.7,8 The major change from
RECIST is the definition of the target lesion, which is no
longer the whole lesion but only the contrast-enhanced
portion of the hepatic lesion at the arterial phase of a
dynamic imaging technique; the definitions of progression and response follow RECIST.9,10 mRECIST offer
clearly defined criteria for the assessment of this vascularization, enabling an evaluation of response with a routine
4-phase computed tomography (CT) scan (ceCT scan) or
magnetic resonance image.
We applied mRECIST to a series of patients who
received sorafenib. The objective of the current study was
to determine whether the application of mRECIST
improves prognosis classification compared with RECIST
1.1. To have a better overview for determining the RR,
only patients who had sufficient follow-up were included.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively analyzed data from all patients who
received sorafenib as treatment for advanced HCC in our
institution. Inclusion criteria were: HCC proven histologically or diagnosed by noninvasive criteria (in a patient
with known cirrhosis, either an intrahepatic lesion that
measured between 1 and 2 cm in greatest dimension with

148

arterial enhancement and portal wash out on 2 imaging
modalities or an intrahepatic lesion that measured >2 cm
with arterial enhancement on 1 imaging modality and
either portal wash out or a-fetoprotein [AFP]
>200 ng/mL)11; initiation and follow-up of treatment
done in our institution; a baseline ceCT scan obtained at
least 1 month before treatment and sufficient follow-up
with at least 2 ceCTscans obtained after the initiation of
the treatment; and at least 1 target lesion according to
RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST on the baseline CT scan.
Exclusion criteria were: concomitant antineoplastic treatment, transarterial treatment, or radiofrequency ablation
performed <3 months before the initiation of sorafenib.
Our standard imaging follow-up in patients who received
sorafenib is 1 CT scan in the first and second months and
every 2 months thereafter.
Data Collection and Radiologic Interpretation
We collected clinical and biologic data needed to classify
patients according to the Child-Pugh, Barcelona Clinic
for Liver Cancer (BCLC), and Cancer of the Liver Italian
Program (CLIP) classifications. Images were obtained on
a multidetector CT with multiphasic, contrast-enhanced
acquisitions at the arterial (40 seconds) and portal (70 seconds) phases. A 120-mL injection of iodine contrast
media (300 mg/mL) with an average flow rate of 3 mL/
second was performed. Every CT scan was reviewed retrospectively by 2 medical oncologists who specialized in
liver cancers, and tumor response was evaluated separately
according to RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST in a nonblinded
fashion.7,9,10 The target lesions were defined by both
physicians for all patients on their pretreatment CT scans;
then, each physician made separate measurements and
determined the RR; in case of disagreement, a consensus
was reached. A target lesion was defined as the whole
lesion for RECIST assessment and as the contrastenhanced portion of the lesion at the arterial phase for
mRECIST assessment. In case of discontinuous enhancement, the measure avoided zones of nonenhancement. In
case of residual multinodular enhancement, the largest
zone of continuous enhancement was measured (for
an example of RECIST and mRECIST evaluations, see
Fig. 1). Nonhepatic lesions, if present, also could be considered as target lesion but without taking into account
their vascularization. In the event of ascites, a cytologic examination was performed, and progression was retained
only after cytologic confirmation of its neoplastic nature.
Every target lesion was chosen on the baseline CT scan,
and the sum of the maximal dimensions of every target

lesion was calculated on every CT scan. In case of a mixed
response, the sum of greatest dimensions prevailed in the
evaluation of each target lesion measured separately. A
partial response (PR) was defined as a 30% decrease in the
sum of maximal dimensions, progressive disease (PD) was
defined as a 20% increase of the sum of maximal dimensions, and all other variations were classified as stable disease (SD), but documentation had to occur 6 weeks
after the baseline determination. A complete response
(CR) corresponded to the disappearance of all lesions for
RECIST evaluation and to the disappearance of all contrast-enhancement at the arterial phase for mRECIST
evaluation. Objective response (OR) was defined as the
sum of CRs and PRs. Every response had to be confirmed
by a subsequent CT scan. We also recorded the best variation (maximal decrease or minimal increase) in the sum of
greatest lesion dimensions for each patient.

Each survival analysis started at the time sorafenib
therapy was initiated. Overall survival analysis ended at
the time of death or was censored at the time of the last
follow-up visit.
Statistical Analysis
Each analysis was performed with the use of a 2-sided a
level of .05 by using the SPSS software package (version
17.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill). The chi-square test was
used for frequency comparisons, and Pearson tests were
used for correlation analyses. Survival data were analyzed
by using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test.

available, 54 patients (96.4%) could be evaluated by
RECIST, and 53 patients (94.6%) could be evaluated by
mRECIST. One nonevaluable patient according to both
criteria had only bone lesions, and the other had multiple
infracentimetric hepatic lesions. The only patient who
was evaluable by RECIST and nonevaluable by mRECIST had 2 intrahepatic lesions, received pretreatment
with transarterial chemoembolization 6 months before
the initiation of sorafenib, and had documented RECIST
progression of the lesions but without clear arterial
enhancement.
Patient characteristics are summarized Table 1.
Treatments received before sorafenib were surgery or radiofrequency ablation in 13 patients, transarterial procedures in 11 patients, pravastatin12 in 6 patients, and
systemic chemotherapy13 in 1 patient. All radiofrequency
and transarterial procedures were received >3 months
before the initiation of sorafenib, and patients experienced
documented progression by RECIST 1.1 after pravastatin
or chemotherapy.
Best responses as assessed by RECIST and mRECIST are reported in Table 2. Differences in response
measurements between the 2 investigators were rare and
were observed predominantly in voluminous lesions with
central necrosis. However, there was no discrepancy in

assessing response as CR, PR, SD, or PD. The OR rates
according to RECIST and mRECIST were 1.9% (1 of 53
patients) and 22.6% (12 of 53), respectively. Differences
in distribution of responses according to RECIST and
mRECIST (Table 2) were statistically significant (P <
.001). It is noteworthy that, among 42 patients who were
classified with SD by RECIST, 11 patients (26.2%) were
reclassified as overall responders by mRECIST, and 2
patients (3.8%) were reclassified with PD. Overall, a discordance between the response evaluations with the 2
methods was observed for 15 patients (28.3%). Examples
of discordance are presented in Figure 3. We did not
observe any particular imaging features on baseline CT
scans (involvement of >50% of the liver, portal vein
thrombosis, outside liver metastasis, massive necrotic
lesions, or small plain lesions) that could predict either
response or progression according to RECIST or mRECIST. There was no association between response and
Child-Pugh, BCLC, or CLIP classifications. However, a
performance status (PS) of 0 was associated with a 34.5%
OR rate by mRECIST, as opposed to a 8.3% OR rate in
patients with a PS of 1, although the difference was not
strictly statistically significant (P ¼ .063).

The observed maximal variations in the sum of the
greatest target lesion dimensions are presented in Figure 4
for both criteria methods. There was good correlation
(P < .001) between the 2 assessments (Pearson correlation
coefficient r ¼ 0.818). Differences between maximal variations in the greatest dimensions measured by RECIST
or mRECIST were particularly pronounced for patients
who had a decrease in greatest tumor dimension according
to RECIST.
Of the 12 patients who achieved an OR by mRECIST, the median time to response was 2.1 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.5-3.6 months). At the time of
analysis, progression was observed in 41 patients (77.4%).
Progression was defined only by the appearance of new
lesions, without progression of the target lesions, in 9
patients (22%). The median time to progression was similar between the 2 criteria and was 4.1 months (95% CI,
2.8-5.4 months) according to RECIST and 3.9 months
(95% CI, 2.8-5.1 months) according to mRECIST. Progression dates differed between the 2 methods in 10
patients (24.4%), and progression was observed with the
alternative method in the next CT scan in all but 2
patients, in whom progression according to mRECIST
preceded RECIST progression by 7.8 months and 9.6
months.
Survival Analysis According to Radiologic
Response
At the time of data analysis, 44 patients (83%) had
died, the mean OS for the entire population was 9.7
months, and the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were
41.6% and 23.7%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier
estimates of OS after the response evaluated by

Cancer

January 1, 2012

RECIST and mRECIST are presented in Figure 5.
Both methods provided good correlation of OS according to response (log-rank test: P ¼ .002 for RECIST;
P ¼ .001 for mRECIST). The median OS for patients
with OR, SD, and PD was 33.5 months (1 patient),
11.2 months (95% CI, 7.5-14.9 months; 42 patients),
and 4.2 months (95% CI, 0.9-7.5, months; 10
patients), respectively, for RECIST, and 18.2 months
(95% CI, 15.4-20.9 months; 12 patients), 9.7 months
(95% CI, 7.1-12.3 months; 30 patients), and
6.0 months (95% CI, 3.3-8.7 months; 11 patients),
respectively, for mRECIST.
The survival of patients who achieved an OR as
assessed by mRECIST was significantly better than the
survival of nonresponding patients (SD or PD), with a
median OS of 18.2 months (95% CI, 15.4-20.9 months)
and 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.3-9.0 months), respectively
(P ¼ .013) (Fig. 6). Finally, in the 42 patients who were
classified with SD according to RECIST, response
according to mRECIST distinguished a significantly different prognosis (Fig. 7), with a median OS of 17.1
months (95% CI, 14.6-19.7 months), 9.7 months (95%
CI, 5.9-13.5 months), and 3.7 months in patients who
had an OR (n ¼ 11), SD (n ¼ 29), or PD (n ¼ 2),
respectively (P ¼ .016).

DISCUSSION
Sorafenib represents a breakthrough in the treatment of
advanced HCC with a clinically meaningful improvement
in OS, despite a minimal RR as assessed by RECIST 1.0
of only 2%2 or 3.3%.5 This discrepancy, as well as others
observed with locoregional or transarterial treatments,14
led the EASL to recommend studying tumor vascularization for the evaluation of treatment response.6 After these
recommendations, numerous studies evaluated the RR
with different methodologies.15-27 Those studies tended
to indicate a benefit from taking tumor vascularization
into account and reported an increase in the RR despite
great variations in methodology.28,29 However, reproducibility is an issue when these techniques require the definition of a region of interest, which can be more prone to
bias than the measure of a single tumor dimension. In 1
study, investigators tried to correlate response as assessed
by World Health Organization (WHO), RECIST 1.0, or
EASL criteria with survival.23 That study concerned
patients who underwent chemoembolization or radioembolization, and the 3 methods of response assessment
allowed for a good correlation between response and

liver is shown (A) at baseline and (B) 1 month after the initiation of sorafenib treatment. The enhancement disappeared completely after treatment without any change to the global greatest lesion dimension, which is defined as stable disease according

mRECIST. (D) However, a later computed tomography scan revealed that the lesion progressed according to mRECIST. mRECIST
evaluation should draw the maximal dimension of continuous arterial enhancement in such lesions with central necrosis, avoiding
central necrosis. Note that the maximal dimension according to RECIST and mRECIST evaluation can be on different levels.

study examining mRECIST assessment of response to targeted therapies has been published to date. One study has
been presented that was based on a phase 2 brivanib (a
multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor) first-line trial, and
the results reflected increases in the RR and in the time to
progression using mRECIST compared with modified
WHO criteria.30 In other contexts, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors or antiangiogenic treatments, alternatives to RECIST focusing on tissue viability also have
been proposed, but they do not have the precision of
mRECIST.31,32 Another potential approach to response
assessment is the use of AFP. One study applied AFP
response in a population that underwent transarterial procedures,33 another study applied AFP response to patients
who received treatment with different antiangiogenic
drugs,34 and a third study applied AFP response to

patients who received chemotherapy.35 Those 3 studies
reflected better survival for responders; however, only the
third study tried to investigate the benefit of AFP response
in patients who were classified as stable according to
WHO criteria. Those authors observed a nonsignificant
trend toward better survival for AFP responders versus
nonresponders (median survival, 10.3 months vs
8.2 months; P ¼ .056).35
In our current retrospective study of patients who
received sorafenib, we compared RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST to determine whether mRECIST could be useful as
a tool for clinical research and clinical practice. Our population was composed of 70 patients in a 2.5-year period;
this population was somewhat biased (frequency of
patients with Child-Pugh B, of pretreated patients, and of

153

Original Article

patients with BCLC B disease) because of concomitant
phase 2 and 3 trials of novel agents in this setting. Nevertheless, our population was quite similar to patients who
are treated in routine clinical practice. Fourteen patients
were excluded because they had received another treatment (mostly radioembolization) while they were receiving sorafenib, or because their initial CT scan was of poor
quality (no arterial phase), or because they died too early
to allow an evaluation of response. Thus, among the 56
patients who had technically good imaging studies and
sufficient follow-up, mRECIST evaluation appeared to be
widely applicable for 53 assessable patients (94.6%) compared with 54 assessable patients (96.4%) by RECIST.
Only 1 patient assessed by RECIST could not be assessed
by mRECIST because of the absence of clear tumor
hypervascularization. In this retrospective study, we used
CT scans, because this modality is the most commonly
used in our institution. However, mRECIST also can be
applied to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, probably with the same feasibility and results as
attained with CT scanning.
mRECIST assessment of response to sorafenib identified a population that included 22.6% responders,
which is more in line with the efficacy of treatment in
terms of OS than the 2% to 3.3% RR as assessed by
RECIST (reported in the SHARP study,2 in the AP trial,5
and also in the current series). Maximal variations in the
analysis of target lesion greatest dimensions emphasizes
this point: Even with RECIST evaluation, decreases in
greatest tumor dimensions were noted, but they were not
sufficient to reach the threshold for an OR. mRECIST
evaluation increases the amplitude of the observed shrinkage and provides a more striking appraisal of the therapeutic effect. Such differences are of particular importance for
the evaluation of new drugs in phase 2 trials.36-38 It is
noteworthy that the development of sorafenib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma used an alternative phase 2
design: the randomized discontinuation trial.39 Otherwise, responses were observed quite early during treatment
(median time to response, 2.1 months). However, despite
small variations, there was no meaningful difference in
terms of progression between RECIST and mRECIST.
According to mRECIST evaluation, responders
have a better prognosis than nonresponders. This applies
to a much larger population of responders than the 2% of
patients classified as responders according to RECIST.
The difference is in the same range as the difference
observed with AFP responders reported by Shao et al34
(median OS, 18.2 months vs 7.7 months for mRECIST

154

responders and nonresponders, respectively, in our study
and 15.3 months vs 4.1 months for AFP responders and
nonresponders, respectively, in the study by Shao et al). In
any event, AFP response can be applied only to patients
who have elevated AFP levels before therapy, which
defines a narrower population than patients who are
evaluable by mRECIST, and AFP can be increased in liver
disease without HCC, particularly in patients who have
an underlying viral disease.
More important, in the 79.2% of patients classified
as stable by RECIST, the use of mRECIST enabled the
prediction of different prognostic subgroups with a significantly better median OS of 17.1 months for responding
patients compared with 9.7 months for stable patients.
Hence, the differences observed in vascularization reflect a
real biologic change in the tumor with clinically meaningful implications for the patient. Efforts should be made in
a different setting (eg, preoperative transarterial procedure) to address the correlation between radiologic mRECIST response and pathologic or biologic changes. In
some ongoing randomized controlled trials of targeted
therapies in HCC, an analysis of both RECIST and mRECIST is done, and we will have more robust prospective
data in the future.
However, in the current study, there was no significant difference in assessing the time to progression
between the 2 methods. Disease progression seems to
involve an increase in vascularization that immediately
translates into an increase in the greatest lesion dimension.
The time to progression in different subgroups according
to the 2 methods did not clearly differ; however, the 2month interval between the CT scan and the poor number of included patients may have hidden a difference.
Targeted therapies are expensive and are associated
with certain adverse effects that impair quality of life. It is
important in clinical practice to have a relevant tool to
guide treatment planning. ceCT scan is the usual method
for tumor assessment in HCC. In this retrospective study,
we observed that mRECIST provided a useful evaluation
of response to sorafenib. Determination was easy and
applicable in almost all patients. The prognostic information obtained was better than that obtained with
RECIST. mRECIST allowed us to characterize a population of responders, corresponding to >20% of patients,
who had significantly better outcomes than nonresponders. Moreover, among patients who were classified as
stable according to RECIST, the use of mRECIST differentiated a subset of patients that undoubtedly benefited
from sorafenib despite having the same prognosis

assessment provided by RECIST. Therefore, mRECIST
evaluation may help to guide the continuation of sorafenib, especially in patients who have difficulty tolerating
treatment. In such patients, stability is the most frequent
response according to RECIST (almost 80% of patients).
The value of AFP level changes in these stable patients
needs to be evaluated prospectively. If the patient is categorized as a responder by mRECIST, then efforts should
be made in supportive care to keep the patient on sorafenib; conversely, if the patient is categorized with PD by
mRECIST, then sorafenib probably should be stopped,
because there is a low probability that it will be useful
for the patient. It also would be interesting to study this
alternative to RECIST in other situations, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors or the evaluation of antiangiogenic therapies.31,32 In any event, mRECIST should
become the new standard for evaluating new treatments
in HCC.
