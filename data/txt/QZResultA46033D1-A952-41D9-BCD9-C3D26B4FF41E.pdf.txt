Abstract
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is constitutively activated in human myeloma, has
been implicated in bone destruction by this cancer, but the processes it recruits are obscure. In this study, we
show that p38 activity in myeloma inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, but also enhances
osteoclast maturation and bone resorption. p38 regulated the expression and secretion of the Wnt pathway
antagonist DKK-1 and the monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1. Attenuating p38, DKK-1, or MCP-1 were each
sufﬁcient to reduce bone lesions in vivo. Although it is well known that DKK-1 inhibits osteoblast
differentiation, we found that together with MCP-1, it could also promote osteoclast differentiation and
bone resorption. The latter effects were mediated by enhancing expression of RANK in osteoclast progenitor
cells and by upregulating secretion of its ligand RANKL from stromal cells and mature osteoblasts. In
summary, our study deﬁned the mechanisms by which p38 signaling in myeloma cells regulates osteoblastogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and bone destruction. Our ﬁndings, which may have implications for bone
invasion by other cancers where p38 is elevated, strongly suggests that targeting p38 for inhibition may
offer an effective therapeutic approach to treat osteolytic bone lesions in patients with myeloma. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Bone destruction is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. More
than 80% of myeloma patients have osteolysis, which is characterized by pathologic fractures, severe bone pain, spinal cord
compression, and hypercalcemia. These symptoms can severely compromise a patient's quality of life and performance
status (1, 2). It has been proposed that myeloma cells activate
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and inhibit osteoblastmediated bone formation (3–5), but the mechanism underlying
the association of myeloma cells with bone lesions remains
poorly elucidated.
Constitutive activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (p38 MAPK) has been found in benign bone diseases

and malignant osteolytic tumors, including multiple myeloma
(6–8). We recently discovered that p38 activity in myeloma
cells is a master contributor to osteolysis in multiple myeloma
(9). Our results show that the majority of established myeloma
cell lines and primary myeloma cells from patients have
high levels of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38). Injection of myeloma cells with high or detectable p38 levels into severe
combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID) and SCID-hu mice
not only established myeloma but also caused severe lytic
lesions in the murine and human bones; in contrast, injection
of myeloma cells with no detectable p38 activity only established myeloma. Furthermore, disruption of p38 activity in
myeloma cells by speciﬁc p38 shRNAs or inhibitors abrogated
myeloma-induced bone lesions in mice, without affecting
tumor growth, survival, or ability to home to the bones. In
this study, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of
activated tumor cell p38 in myeloma-mediated osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis.
Our results show that constitutive activation of p38 in
myeloma cells leads to monocyte chemotactic protein-1
(MCP-1) and dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) expression and secretion.
The p38-upregulated DKK-1 inhibits osteoblastogenesis,
whereas p38-upregulated DKK-1 and MCP-1 promote osteoclast maturation and function via enhancing RANK/RANKL
expression and activating NF-kB, p38, and ERK signaling
pathways in their progenitor cells. These studies elucidate a
novel mechanism of myeloma cell p38-induced osteolytic bone
lesions and provide a strong rationale for developing new
strategies targeting myeloma cell p38 activity for the treatment
or prevention of myeloma bone disease.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and primary myeloma cells
The myeloma cell lines ARP-1 and MM.1S have been
described previously (10). Other myeloma cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
These cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat
proﬁling and by matching with the proﬁle published in
ATCC. All myeloma cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Primary myeloma
cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirates obtained
from patients during routine clinic visits by magnetic bead
sorting for CD138þ cells (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, TX).
Plasmids and reagents
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) for p38 3 isoforms including
a, b, and g were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
and packed into the retroviral vector pSIREN-RetroQ (BD
Biosciences, Clontech). Retroviral infections were conducted
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Retroviral
vector supernatants of the p38 shRNAs were pooled and
used to infect myeloma cells at 1:4 dilution. Stable cell lines
were established in the presence of 1 mg/mL puromycin. In
addition, siRNAs speciﬁc for p38 a, b, and g were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In the experiments, cells
were harvested, plated on a 24-well plate at a concentration
of 2  105 cells per well, and transiently transfected with
pooled siRNAs or nonspeciﬁc/control siRNA at different
doses using the Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Mirus)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The p38
MAPK-speciﬁc inhibitors were purchased from Axon Medchem BV. Recombinant DKK-1 and MCP-1 were purchased
from R&D Systems.
Mouse model, antibody treatment, and detection of
osteolytic bone lesions by radiography
CB.17 SCID mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. All mice were maintained in the American Association of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facilities, and
the studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Six- to
8-week-old mice were inoculated intravenously with 1  106
myeloma cells. Serum was collected from the mice daily
during the treatment and tested for myeloma-secreted
M-proteins [human immunoglobulin (Ig)] or their light
chains by using ELISA. For antibody treatment, the mice
were injected intraperitoneally with neutralizing antibodies
speciﬁc for MCP-1 or DKK-1 or with control IgG twice per
week for 20 days. To measure lytic bone lesions, radiographs were obtained using a Faxitron X-ray cabinet (Faxitron X-ray).

Results
Myeloma cell p38 upregulates myeloma cell production
of osteolytic mediators DKK-1 and MCP-1
Recent studies have shown that myeloma cells release
multiple cytokines or chemokines to the bone marrow microenvironment and regulate the process of bone remodeling (3).
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying myeloma p38-mediated bone destruction, we speciﬁcally and stably knocked
down p38 using shRNAs (9) and examined cytokines and
chemokines that are regulated by p38 and play a role in bone
remodeling in myeloma cells (ARP-1 and MM.1S). A cytokine
array containing speciﬁc antibodies for 48 inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, the majority of which are known
regulators of bone remodeling, was used. As shown in Fig.
1A, the levels of 10 osteoclastogenesis-associated cytokines
were lower in p38 shRNA-treated ARP-1 (p38 shRNA-ARP-1)
cells than in vector control-treated ARP-1 (vector-ARP-1) cells.
Among these cytokines, MCP-1, which has recently been
shown to induce osteoclast differentiation in prostate cancer
(11), was highly expressed in vector-ARP-1 cells but signiﬁcantly downregulated in p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells (Fig. 1B; P <
0.01). Real-time PCR (Fig. 1C) and ELISA (Fig. 1D) conﬁrmed
the results (P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained with
MM.1S cells (data not shown). Because DKK-1 and RANKL,
2 important cytokines involved in bone resorption, were not
included in the cytokine array, we examined their expression in
the myeloma cells. Both real-time PCR (Fig. 1C) and ELISA (Fig.
1E) showed that the expression and secretion of DKK-1 are
downregulated in p38 shRNA-ARP-1 and p38 shRNA-MM.1S
cells (P < 0.001, compared with controls). RANKL (data not
shown) was not expressed by the cells. Consistent with these
results, DKK-1 and MCP-1 were the main cytokines that were
highly secreted by primary myeloma cells with high or detectable pp38 as compared with primary myeloma cells with
undetectable pp38 (Fig. 1F; P < 0.01). These results clearly
suggest that DKK-1 and MCP-1 are the products of p38 in
myeloma cells and might be involved in the formation of bone
lesions.
On the basis of these results, we focused on DKK-1 and MCP1 in subsequent studies. First, to verify the relationship
between p38 and the expression of DKK-1 and MCP-1 in
myeloma cells, the p38-speciﬁc inhibitor SB203580 (SB20) or
siRNAs were used to inhibit or knockdown p38 in myeloma
cells. Western blot analysis showed that treatment of ARP-1 or
MM.1S (data not shown) cells with SB20 signiﬁcantly downregulated, in a dose-dependent manner, the levels of phosphorylated MAPKPK-2 (pMK2), a downstream kinase of p38,
DKK-1, and MCP-1, but not p-p38 (Fig. 2A). Because SB20 does
not inhibit the phosphorylation of p38 but inhibits phosphorylation of its downstream kinase (12), slightly elevated levels of
pp38 were observed in SB20-treated cells. Moreover, siRNAs
speciﬁc for p38 (Fig. 2B) or the p38 upstream kinase MKK3/6
(Fig. 2C), but not control siRNAs (data not shown), also
signiﬁcantly inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the
expression of DKK-1, MCP-1, p-p38, and p38 or pMKK3/6 and

MKK3/6, respectively, in ARP-1 and MM.1S cells. ARP-1 and
MM.1S secretion of DKK-1 (Fig. 2D) and MCP-1 (Fig. 2E) into
culture supernatant was also inhibited by treatment with SB20
or siRNAs speciﬁc for p38 or MKK3/6 (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001).
More importantly, SB20 treatment also signiﬁcantly inhibited
secretion of DKK-1 (Fig. 2F) and MCP-1 (Fig. 2G) by primary
myeloma cells (P < 0.01).
To examine the role of these cytokines in myeloma cellinduced bone lesions in vivo, we measured and compared
the levels of circulating DKK-1 and MCP-1 in SCID mice
injected with the myeloma cells. Before tumor inoculation,
the levels of human DKK-1 (Fig. 3A) and MCP-1 (Fig. 3B) in
the mouse sera were undetectable. Eight weeks after tumor
injection, high levels of human DKK-1 and MCP-1 were
detected in mice injected with control ARP-1 or MM.1S
(data not shown) cells, and signiﬁcantly lower levels of the 2
cytokines were observed in mice injected with p38 shRNA-

revealed positive staining for DKK-1 and MCP-1 in vector-ARP-1 but not p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells in the bone

were also obtained in ARP-1- or MM.1S-xenografted SCID
mice (data not shown) and in primary myeloma cell-xenografted SCID-hu mice treated with or without the p38
inhibitor SD-169 (Fig. 3D). However, knocking down p38
activity in myeloma cells did not affect their growth in the
mice (9).
Neutralizing antibodies against DKK-1 or MCP-1 were
used to conﬁrm their roles in the formation of bone lesions
in vivo. SCID mice were injected intravenously with the
parental ARP-1 or MM.1S cells, and beginning at week 4
(when tumors were established, without bone destruction)
received intraperitoneal injections of anti-DKK-1 (10 mg/kg)
and/or anti-MCP-1 (20 mg/kg) antibodies twice a week for a

total of 8 injections. Injections of equal amounts of IgG or
PBS served as controls. Our results showed that treatment
with antibodies against MCP-1 or DKK-1, but not control
IgG, signiﬁcantly reduced lytic bone lesions (Fig. 3E; P < 0.01)
without affecting tumor burdens in the mice (data not
shown). Interestingly, treatment with antibodies against
both DKK-1 and MCP-1 almost prevented the development
of osteolytic bone lesions in most (8/10) of the myelomabearing mice. The neutralizing antibodies were also used in
primary myeloma-bearing SCID-hu mice, with similar
results (data not shown). Taken together, these ﬁndings
clearly indicate that myeloma cell-derived DKK-1 and
MCP-1 play a critical role in mediating the development of
osteolytic bone lesions in vivo.
Myeloma cell p38 inhibits osteoblast differentiation and
function via DKK-1
It is well known that bone remodeling is regulated by
osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclastinduced bone resorption (13). We have shown that myeloma
cell p38 inhibits osteoblastogenesis and enhances osteoclastogenesis in vivo in myeloma-bearing SCID and SCID-hu
mouse models. In this study, we examined the ability of
and mechanism by which tumor cell p38 downregulates
osteoblast differentiation and bone formation activity via
DKK-1 and/or MCP-1. The differentiation and maturity
of osteoblasts can be monitored by their production of
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in culture medium and their

6396

expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and
osteocalcin.
The results showed that vector-ARP-1 cells (data not shown)
or their conditioned medium suppressed the differentiation of
osteoblasts, as evidenced by large numbers of poorly differentiated cells that were BMP-2- and osteocalcin-negative (Fig.
4A), low production of ALP (Fig. 4B; P < 0.001), and compromised bone formation activity, as determined by Alizarin RedS staining assay (Fig. 4C; P < 0.01). In contrast, cultures
containing conditioned medium from p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells
generated BMP-2- and osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts, with
production of high levels of ALP and bone formation activity.
Similarly, conditioned medium of MM.1S cells (data not
shown) or primary myeloma cells (Fig. 4D; P < 0.001) with
high or detectable p38 activity (Pt 9) suppressed osteoblast
differentiation, as evident by the low production of ALP,
whereas primary myeloma cells with low or undetectable
p38 activity (Pt 10) had no such effects (Fig. 4E). Further
studies showed that DKK-1, but not MCP-1, secreted by
myeloma cells is mainly responsible for inhibited osteoblastogenesis, because the addition of neutralizing antibodies
speciﬁc for DKK-1, but not MCP-1 or control IgG (data not
shown), to the conditioned medium of vector-ARP-1 or MM.1S
(data not shown) cells restored the generation of functional
osteoblasts (Fig. 4F; P < 0.001). Similarly, the addition of
exogenous DKK-1, but not MCP-1, to conditioned medium
from p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells also inhibited osteoblastogenesis
(Fig. 4G; P < 0.001). Taken together, these results clearly

indicate that DKK-1 was responsible for myeloma p38-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and activity.
Myeloma cell p38 activates osteoclast differentiation and
bone resorption activity via DKK-1 and MCP-1
Next, we investigated the impact and mechanism of tumor
cell p38 activity on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in vitro. To mimic the in vivo bone marrow microenvironment, a Transwell coculture system was used in which
1  105 osteoclast precursors/mL were seeded on the bottom
of the wells and 10-fold numbers of mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC) were planted in the Transwell inserts. The cells were
cocultured in osteoclast medium, with or without RANKL. In
some experiments, conditioned media of different ARP-1 or
MM.1S cells were added to the cocultures. Mature multinuclear osteoclasts were generated in cocultures with addition of
RANKL and in cocultures without RANKL in the presence of
conditioned medium of vector-ARP-1 cells but not in the
presence of p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cell-conditioned medium (Fig.
5A and B; P < 0.001). As TRAP5b is the active component of
TRAP and is secreted only by mature osteoclasts, we measured
the levels of TRAP5b in media from the cocultures. The
addition of conditioned medium from vector-ARP-1, but not
from p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells upregulated TRAP5b secretion in

a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C; P < 0.01 to P < 0.001).
Similar results were obtained from cocultures of MM.1S (data
not shown) or primary myeloma cells with high, but not with
low, p38 activity (Fig. 5D; P < 0.001).
Furthermore, osteoclasts generated in the cocultures with
conditioned medium of ARP-1 cells resorbed efﬁciently mineralized matrices (Fig. 6A; top) and bone slices (bottom). Analysis
of the resorbed area indicates that the osteoclasts formed
larger resorption areas (Fig. 6B; P < 0.001) and deeper resorbed
bone pits (Fig. 6C; P < 0.001) and secreted more soluble CTX-1
(Fig. 6D; P < 0.001) in comparison with cells generated in
cocultures in medium devoid of RANKL or with the addition
of conditioned medium from p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells.
Because myeloma cells secreted DKK-1 and MCP-1, we
examined whether these cytokines were involved in osteoclastogenesis. Antibodies speciﬁc for DKK-1 and/or MCP-1 were
added to the coculture of osteoclast precursors and MSCs in
the presence or absence of conditioned medium of parental
ARP-1 cells. After a 7-day culture, the telomeric repeat ampliﬁcation protocol (TRAP)-positive, multinuclear osteoclasts
were counted and the levels of TRAP5b in the medium were
measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6E, the addition of either
anti-DKK-1 or anti-MCP-1 antibodies partially inhibited the
generation of mature osteoclasts, and the addition of both

antibodies had a greater effect (P < 0.001). Alternatively, the
addition of exogenous DKK-1, MCP-1, and especially both, to
the conditioned medium of p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells restored
the generation of mature osteoclasts in the cocultures devoid
of RANKL (Fig. 6F; P < 0.001). Taken together, these results
clearly indicate that DKK-1 and MCP-1 are responsible for
myeloma p38-mediated activation of osteoclast differentiation
and activity in vitro and in vivo.

Next, we examined signaling pathways in osteoclast activation in relation to tumor cell p38 activity. We focused on NFkB, PI3K/Akt, and MAPKs, such as ERK, p38, and c-jun-NH2-

kinase (JNK), because these pathways have been reported to be
involved in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation (14). In
the experiments, osteoclast precursors were treated with
conditioned medium of ARP-1 or MM.1S (data not shown)
cells for 3 days. The cells were then collected, and phosphorylation of IkBa, Akt, ERK, p38, and JNK was detected by using
Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7A, the addition of
tumor conditioned medium from vector-ARP-1, but not p38
shRNA-ARP-1 cells, upregulated the phosphorylation of IkBa,
p38, ERK1/2 and Akt, and slightly decreased the phosphorylation of JNK during osteoclast differentiation. The levels of
nonphosphorylated kinases (data not shown) and b-actin were
unchanged. These signaling pathways were essential for osteoclast differentiation, because the addition of kinase inhibitors

abrogated the generation of osteoclasts induced by the tumorconditioned medium (Fig. 7B; P < 0.001).
Recent studies have shown that IkBa, ERK1/2, and p38
signaling pathways are activated by RANKL, an osteoclast
activator, which binds to its receptor RANK on osteoclast
precursors. However, as myeloma cells express low levels of
RANKL (data not shown), we hypothesized that myeloma cells
activate RANK/RANKL signaling pathways in osteoclast precursors via secreted DKK-1 and MCP-1. By using Western blot
analysis, we examined the expression of RANK in CD14þ
monocytes and in M-CSF–induced osteoclast precursors treated with or without conditioned medium of vector- or p38
shRNA-ARP-1 or MM.1S (data not shown) cells. The conditioned medium of vector-ARP-1 cells signiﬁcantly increased
RANK expression in both monocytes and osteoclast precursors, whereas the medium of p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells only
slightly upregulated RANK expression (Fig. 7C and 7D). Our
studies also showed that conditioned medium of vector-ARP-1,
but not p38 shRNA-ARP-1, cells signiﬁcantly upregulated the
expression (Fig. 7E) and secretion (Fig. 7F; P < 0.001) of RANKL
by MSCs and mature osteoblasts. Hence, these results support
our hypothesis that myeloma cells modulate the expression of
RANK and RANKL in osteoclasts and marrow stromal cells.
To determine whether DKK-1 and MCP-1 mediate the
myeloma p38-induced increase of RANK/RANKL expression,
neutralizing antibodies against these cytokines were used. As
shown in Fig. 7G, antibodies against MCP-1, but not DKK-1,
signiﬁcantly abrogated conditioned medium-induced expression of surface RANK on CD14þ monocytes (P < 0.01). On the
other hand, anti-DKK-1 antibody remarkably inhibited tumor-

induced RANKL secretion in MSCs (Fig. 7H; P < 0.001). These
results indicate that tumor-derived DKK-1 upregulates RANKL
expression and secretion from stromal cells, and tumorderived MCP-1 enhances RANK expression in the progenitors
of osteoclasts, both of which activate RANK/RANKL-mediated
signaling pathways in the progenitor cells, leading to osteoclast
differentiation and activation.

Discussion
The p38 MAPK is an important signaling pathway involved
in cell growth, survival, differentiation and inﬂammatory
response, and can be activated by a variety of cellular stresses,
including inﬂammatory cytokines, endotoxin, ultraviolet light,
and growth factors (6–8). Functionally, p38 mediates the
production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and other factors
such as TNF-a (15, 16) and soluble RANKL (17, 18). Preclinical
studies indicate that inhibition of p38 suppresses the induction
of inﬂammatory, angiogenic, and proapoptotic cytokines from
bone marrow stromal cells (19). Moreover, p38 signaling plays
an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma,
including myeloma growth and survival and drug resistance
(20, 21). Our previous study has shown that activated p38
signaling in myeloma cells induces osteolytic bone lesions in
myeloma by inhibiting osteoblastogenesis and enhancing
osteoclastogenesis (9). The current study further elucidates
that myeloma cells express and secrete DKK-1 and MCP-1 as a
result of constitutive activation of myeloma p38 signaling.
Consequently, p38-upregulated DKK-1 and MCP-1 enhance
RANK/RANKL expression and activate NF-kB, p38, and ERK
signaling pathways in the progenitors of osteoclasts, leading to

Figure 6. Activated tumor cell p38 enhances osteoclast bone resorption. Osteoclasts were generated in cocultures of osteoclast precursors with MSCs in
osteoclast medium without (medium) or with RANKL, or in osteoclast medium in the absence of RANKL with addition of conditioned medium (CM) of
vector- or p38 shRNA-ARP-1 cells. A, resorption pit analysis showing pit formation on mineralized matrices (top) or dentin slices (bottom) by mature
osteoclasts generated in osteoclast medium devoid of RANKL with the addition of conditioned medium of vector-ARP-1 (Vector), but not of p38
shRNA-ARP-1 (p38 shRNA) cells. Color contours represent the depth of the resorption pits on dentin slices. Summarized data of resorption area per

Representative results of 5 experiments are shown. E, effects of DKK-1- and MCP-1–neutralizing antibodies on the differentiation of mature

osteoclast activation and bone resorption, whereas p38-upregulated DKK-1 inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone
formation, all of which result in bone destruction (Supplementary Fig. S1).
DKK-1 is a well-known inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation. Elevated levels of DKK-1 have been reported to induce
bone loss in patients with inﬂammatory rheumatoid arthritis (21) and myeloma (13, 26). Previous studies have shown
that DKK-1, produced by myeloma cells, inhibits osteoblast
differentiation (22–24) and may enhance osteoclast differentiation (25) and bone lesions (26) by upregulating RANKL
expression on stromal cells. However, the mechanism by
which myeloma cells produce DKK-1 is unclear. By the
analysis of Western blotting, real-time PCR and ELISA, we
for the ﬁrst time show that constitutively activated myeloma
cell p38 signaling upregulates DKK-1 expression and secre-

tion. Inhibition or shRNA knockdown of myeloma p38
signiﬁcantly downregulates DKK-1 secretion in vitro and in
myeloma-bearing mice. Furthermore, we also observe that
myeloma cell p38 signaling induces the expression and
secretion of MCP-1, a chemokine that recruits monocytes,
T cells, and dendritic cells to sites of infection or tissue
injury. MCP-1 is upregulated during osteoclastogenesis,
promotes the fusion of hematopoietic precursors to mature
osteoclasts (27), and determines osteoclast behavior in
inﬂammatory osteoporosis via binding to receptor CCR2
(28). MCP-1 is mainly released from bone marrow stromal
cells (29). However, our results show that myeloma cells also
secrete MCP-1 in vitro and in myeloma-bearing mice, as a
result of constitutive activation of myeloma cell p38. Knocking down myeloma cell p38 reduces MCP-1 expression by
myeloma cells.

Myeloma p38 Regulates Osteoclasts and Osteoblasts

Figure 7. Myeloma cell p38 activates RANK/RANKL signaling in osteoclast precursors via secreted DKK-1 and MCP-1. A, Western blot analysis
showing upregulated levels of phosphorylated (p) IkBa, p38, and ERK, but not JNK and Akt, in osteoclast precursors treated with conditioned medium of
vector-ARP-1 (V) or p38 shRNA-ARP-1 (p38sh) cells. Cells cultured in medium (Med) alone served as control. B, effects of inhibitors speciﬁc for IkBa (IkBinh,
15 mmol/L), p38 (p38inh, SB202190, 50 nmol/L), or ERK (ERKinh, PD98059, 50 mmol/L) on the generation of mature osteoclasts in cocultures with the addition
of conditioned medium (CM) of vector-ARP-1 as detected by the levels of secreted TRAP5b. Effects of conditioned medium of vector- ARP-1 (V) or
p38 shRNA-ARP-1 (p38sh) cells on the expression of RANK on monocytes (Mo) and osteoclast precursors (PreOC) detected by ﬂow cytometry
(monocytes only; C) or Western blot analyses (D) and on the expression of RANKL (E) or secretion of soluble RANKL (sRANKL; F) by MSCs and mature
osteoblasts (OB). G, effects of MCP-1- and DKK-1–neutralizing antibodies on RANK expression detected by ﬂow cytometry on monocytes or on the
secretion of soluble RANKL by MSCs, measured by ELISA (H), induced by conditioned medium of vector- ARP-1 (CMV) or p38 shRNA-ARP-1 (CM-p38sh)
cells. Representative results of 5 independent experiments are shown.   , P  0.01;    , P  0.001.

In addition, our results for the ﬁrst time observe that p38increased DKK-1 not only inhibits osteoblastogenesis, but also
induces osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by
enhancing RANKL secretion from bone marrow stromal cells.
On the other hand, p38-increased MCP-1 upregulates RANK
expression in the progenitors of osteoclasts and activated
RANK/RANKL signaling pathways such as NF-kB, ERK1/2,
and p38 in the cells, leading to osteoclast activation and bone
resorption. Neutralizing both DKK-1 and MCP-1 reduces myeloma-induced osteoclast activation in vitro and bone lesions in
vivo. These results provide an alternative explanation of
RANKL/RANK perturbation in myeloma.
Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate that the development
of myeloma-induced bone lesions is initiated and regulated by
activated p38 signaling in myeloma cells, but is sustained
through the interactions between myeloma cells and surrounding bone marrow cells via p38 upregulating cytokines
or chemokines by myeloma cells. These results shed light on
the regulation of osteolytic cytokine (such as DKK-1 and MCP1) production by myeloma cell p38 activity and identify novel
