(1–12). It is reasonable to propose that such variation in efficacy
reflects genetic heterogeneity in the tumors of treated patients,
and recent evidence strongly supports this possibility. For example,
the ability to respond to selective kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib,
erlotinib, and imatinib, has been correlated with mutations in the
target receptor (13–16). Detailed studies with gefitinib-responsive
(non–small cell lung carcinoma) NSCLC patients showed that
gefitinib efficacy is linked to activating mutations in the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) that sensitize the tumor to the drug,
possibly by stimulating drug-induced apoptosis (17). A causal
relationship between EGFR genotype and drug susceptibility is also
supported by the fact that some drug-resistant alleles carry secondsite mutations that seem to act as suppressors of EGFR-activating,
drug-sensitizing mutations (18, 19). Similar observations have
also been made for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors–derived cells that acquire resistance to
imatinib (20).
A number of EGFR mutations have been described that are
enriched in NSCLC adenocarcinomas and in female never smokers
of Asian ethnicity (21). The EGFR mutations include in-frame
deletions affecting residues 746 to 753, multiple isolates of
EGFR-L858R, and other point mutations in exons 18 to 21 (11).
EGFR-T790M is a second-site mutation that has been reported in
several NSCLC tumors that is strongly associated with resistance
to gefitinib (19). Similar mutational patterns have been reported
in HER2, and Shigematsu and coworkers (22) recently reported
that 11 of 671 (1.6%) of patients’ tumors contained HER2 mutant
alleles in a study of NSCLC. As observed for EGFR , the mutations
included primarily in-frame mutations in exon 20 and were highly
enriched in adenocarcinomas in female never smokers of Asian
ethnicity.
Cell-based studies suggest that the sensitizing mutations in
EGFR potentiate the ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to
activate the receptor, and that the activated mutant EGFR is more
susceptible to drug-dependent inhibition (11, 17, 18). This is
consistent with the fact that the activating mutations are located in
the tyrosine kinase domain and cluster in or near the ATP binding
pocket of EGFR. Cell-based studies typically measure the steadystate level of receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine, so it is currently
unclear if the mutations result in enhanced kinase activity,
enhanced activation by ligand, or reduced down-regulation.
Biochemical studies with purified receptors and structural studies,
including cocrystals with inhibitors, are needed to understand the
mechanism by which these mutations alter clinical outcome for
different drugs and different cancers.
Lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib are members of the 4anilinoquinazoline group of tyrosine kinase inhibitiors. Although
erlotinib and gefitinib are specific inhibitors of EGFR, lapatinib is a

Abstract
The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of non–
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)-associated mutations in
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and HER2
(ErbB2) on interactions with the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor
lapatinib. Biochemical studies show that commonly observed
variants of EGFR [G719C, G719S, L858R, L861Q, and #746–
750 (del15)] are enzyme activating, increasing the tyrosine
kinase V max and increasing the K m (app) for ATP. The point
mutations G719C and L861Q had minor effects on lapatinib
K is, whereas EGFR mutations L858R and del15 had a higher
K i for lapatinib than wild-type EGFR. Structural analysis of
wild-type EGFR-lapatinib complexes and modeling of the
EGFR mutants were consistent with these data, suggesting that
loss of structural flexibility and possible stabilization of the
active-like conformation could interfere with lapatinib binding, particularly to the EGFR deletion mutants. Furthermore,
EGFR deletion mutants were relatively resistant to lapatinibmediated inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation in
recombinant cells expressing the variants, whereas EGFR
point mutations had a modest or no effect. Of note, EGFR
T790M, a receptor variant found in patients with gefitinibresistant NSCLC, was also resistant to lapatinib-mediated
inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation. Two HER2 insertional variants found in NSCLC were less sensitive to lapatinib
inhibition than two HER2 point mutants. The effects of lapatinib on the proliferation of human NSCLC tumor cell lines
expressing wild-type or variant EGFR and HER2 cannot be
explained solely on the basis of the biochemical activity or
receptor autophosphorylation in recombinant cells. These data
suggest that cell line genetic heterogeneity and/or multiple
determinants modulate the role played by EGFR/HER2 in
regulating cell proliferation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):571–9]

Introduction
Several years of clinical experience with targeted tyrosine kinase
inhibitors have shown that the efficacy of these compounds in
the clinic is variable and difficult to predict with high accuracy

as described in the Supplementary Text. Values for the IC50 were
determined by the method of Levenberg and Marquardt (30) with Eq. A:

p.o. potent dual inhibitor of EGFR (ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2;
refs. 23, 24) that strongly down-regulates the antiapoptotic Akt
pathway in responsive cells (25). Biochemical studies show that
the EGFR-lapatinib complex has a long half-life and is characterized by a much slower dissociation rate than the erlotinib- or
gefitinib-receptor complexes (24). This mode of binding may
potentiate drug efficacy by prolonging drug-induced downregulation of receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activity. Indeed,
lapatinib has shown clinical benefit for the treatment of metastatic
breast cancers that overexpress HER2 when given alone or in combination with chemotherapy (26, 27) and was recently approved by
the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients
with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2.
The goal of this study was to characterize the interactions
of lapatinib with wild-type EGFR and several of the common
mutant variants of EGFR observed in NSCLC. For comparison,
receptor variants were also challenged with gefitinib. In addition,
the effect of lapatinib on four variants of HER2 was also examined.
The results presented here reveal distinct similarities and differences in the interaction between lapatinib or gefitinib and EGFR/
HER2.

PCR amplification, sequencing, and cloning. Amplification of the
EGFR gene was performed using genomic DNA from NSCLC cell lines H358,
H1734, H1975, H1650, H322, and A549 (ATCC). PCR primers were designed
within flanking intronic regions to amplify coding region (exons 2–28) in the
EGFR gene (NM_005228.3). Sequence data were not obtained for exon 1 in
any cell line due to high guanine-cytosine content. Primer pairs used for
EGFR amplification are listed in Supplementary Table S1. For direct
sequencing of amplicons, all sequence-specific forward primers were tailed
with the universal M13 forward primer sequence (5¶-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3¶), and all sequence-specific reverse primers were tailed with the
universal M13 reverse primer sequence (5¶-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3¶).
Sequence analysis of the HER2 (NM_004448.2) gene tyrosine kinase
domain (exons 18–24) was accomplished using genomic DNA from NSCLC
cell lines H1781S and Calu-3 (ATCC). Intron-based primers used for PCR
amplification of the HER2 tyrosine kinase domain were reported by
Shigematsu et al. (22) and are listed in Supplementary Table S3. See
Supplementary Text for detailed PCR and sequencing protocols and for
description of cloning and expression of EGFR and HER2 mutants.
Structural modeling. Due to the different EGFR conformations
observed in the erlotinib and lapatinib crystal structures, mutations were
considered in the context of both the active and inactive-like conformations. Models were constructed in both conformations for each mutant and
examined for interactions that would stabilize or destabilize inhibitor
binding. Coordinates from PDB1m17 and PDB1xkk were used as the
starting models for the active and inactive conformations of EGFR. It was
assumed that gefitinib would bind to the same conformation of the protein
as erlotinib.
Enzyme kinetic analysis: determination of catalytic rates V max and
K m (app) for ATP-Mg. V max and K m (app) for ATP-Mg were determined at a
fixed concentration of peptide substrate and variable concentrations of
ATP-Mg. The constructs of the enzyme were based on the intracellular
domain of EGFR (amino acids 671–1210). Enzyme purification and kinase
reaction conditions were as described by Brignola et al. (31). Briefly,
phosphorylated product was detected using 1 ACi [g-33P]ATP per reaction
and the phosphocellulose product detection method. Reaction buffers
contained 50 mmol/L 3-(N-morpholino) propane sulfonic acid (pH 7.5),
10 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mmol/L DTT, and 100 nmol/L
enzyme. Incubations were at 23jC. The peptide substrate, biotin-(aminohexanoic acid)-EEEEYFELVAKKK-CONH2, was used at a fixed concentration of 100 Amol/L. Eleven concentrations of ATP-Mg were used ranging
from 4 to 300 Amol/L. For each substrate concentration, initial rates were
determined from the linear portion of a 30-min time course sampled at 0,
10, 20, and 30 min. In all cases, product formation was <10% of the initial
ATP substrate and <20% of the peptide substrate. V max and K m (app) values
were estimated from these experiments by fitting the data to Eq. B:

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfections. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells
were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in
Ham’s F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Hyclone). CHO-K1 cells were seeded at 2.42  106 per 100-mm
dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were then incubated at 37jC in a CO2
incubator in complete medium containing 0.18 mL Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) and 12 Ag plasmid DNA per dish for 24 h. EGFR and HER2
expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation/Western analyses.
Human NSCLC cell lines NCI H1975, NCI H1650, NCI H1734, NCI H358,
NCI H322, NCI H1781S, Calu-3, and A549 were obtained from the ATCC.
All NSCLC lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% FBS.
Lapatinib and gefitinib treatment. Lapatinib and gefitinib were
synthesized as described (28, 29). Transfected CHO-K1 cells were exposed
to lapatinib or gefitinib at increasing concentrations (0, 0.14, 0.41, 0.12, 0.37,
1.1, and 3.3 Amol/L). Compounds were prepared in DMSO and diluted in
complete medium before dosing. Cells transfected with EGFR constructs
were exposed to drug for 4 h and stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF for 10 min
before cell lysis. Cells transfected with HER2 constructs were exposed to
drug for 4 h and then immediately harvested for cell lysate.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. EGF was from Sigma.
The anti-EGFR antibody for Western detection (aEGFR monoclonal
antibody-12) and the anti-EGFR antibody for immunoprecipitation (aEGFR
EGFR Ab-13) were from Lab Vision. The antiphosphotyrosine antibody aPT66 was from Sigma. The peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The anti-HER2
antibody for Western detection (aHER2 C-18) was from Santa Cruz. The
anti-HER2 antibody for immunoprecipitation (aHER2 Ab-4 Clone N12) was
from Lab Vision. The Alexa Fluor antibody for secondary detection of HER2
was from Invitrogen. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting
were performed as described previously (25).
Cellular growth inhibition studies. The NSCLC cell lines were plated in
100 AL of growth medium in 96-well tissue culture plates at the following
densities: H1975, 5,000 cells per well; H1650, 10,000 cells per well; H1734,
10,000 cells per well; H358, 5,000 cells per well; H322, 5,000 cells per well;
H1781S, 10,000 cells per well; A549, 4,000 cells per well; and CaLu-3, 10,000
cells per well, and the NSCLC cell lines were placed in a humidified 37jC
incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air, overnight. Stock solutions and
compound dilutions as well as the cell proliferation studies were performed

The fraction of a protein sample that is catalytically competent often
varies for mutant and wild-type or for different preparations of the same
enzyme. Therefore, to compare the catalytic activity of mutant enzymes
with each other and the wild-type enzyme, it is important to have an
independent measure of the fraction of the enzyme preparation that is
catalytically competent. The active fraction for enzymes is usually assumed
to be equal to the fraction of the preparation capable of binding a potent
inhibitor that binds in the active site. This value was obtained directly from
K i determinations for lapatinib and gefitinib (E in Eq. C below), and was
used to calculate V max. For wild-type EGFR and all of the EGFR point
mutations, the active fraction of the protein was between 80% and 100%.
For EGFR del15, f10% of total protein was active.

Lapatinib Inhibition of Erb Mutants
Estimation of K i for lapatinib and gefitinib. K i values for lapatinib and
gefitinib were estimated for wild-type and mutant EGFR using second-order
assumptions because these enzyme-inhibitor complexes exhibit tightbinding behavior. Reactions were carried out with variable inhibitor
concentration at several fixed enzyme concentrations. The lapatinib-EGFR
interaction also exhibits significant time-dependent (or slow-binding)
behavior. However, a 30-min preincubation period was sufficient to allow
EGFR-lapatinib binding to reach equilibrium under the conditions of these
experiments. For the EGFR-gefitinib complex, a 5-min preincubation was
sufficient because binding reaches equilibrium more quickly than for the
EGFR-lapatinib complex.
The concentration range for each EGFR-inhibitor pair used in this
analysis was independently selected to optimize the accuracy of the K i
estimate. For each experiment, six fixed concentrations of enzyme were used
that ranged up to six times the initial concentration. The initial nominal
concentration used for each enzyme was as follows: wild-type, 8 nmol/L;
L861Q, 8 nmol/L; G719C, 10 nmol/L; D746–750, 40 nmol/L; and L858R,
7 nmol/L. Thus, for wild-type EGFR, the six nominal concentrations used
were 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 nmol/L. A very similar concentration range
was used for all EGFR variants except D746–750, which was used at a
significantly higher nominal concentration because a relatively small fraction
of this enzyme variant was capable of binding the inhibitor (see Results).
Eleven concentrations of inhibitor were used evenly, spanning concentrations from 10-fold lower than the apparent IC50 to 10-fold higher than the
apparent IC50.
The rate of product formation was determined using the phosphocellulose filter–binding method (31). The concentration of ATP-Mg was 20 Amol/L,
the concentration of peptide, biotin-(aminohexanoic acid)-EEEEYFELVAKKK-CONH2, was 100 Amol/L, and the time of incubation was 20 min.
Each experimental condition was performed in quadruplicate, and the
average rate of product formation was determined. Reaction rates were
expressed as a percentage of the no-inhibitor control reaction for each
concentration of enzyme used. K i app estimates were obtained according
to the general method described by Morrison (32) by globally fitting the data
to Eq. C:

Results
Truncated forms of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4 have been
crystallized as apo proteins or as binary complexes. The binary
complex structures include inhibitors that target the intracellular
kinase domain or antibodies that bind the extracellular domain
(24, 34–41). From these structures, it is apparent that EGFR is
capable of relatively large conformational changes upon inhibitor
or ligand binding. Recent cocrystal structures of EGFR-erlotinib or
EGFR-lapatinib are very different from one another. EGFR-erlotinib
has a structure very similar to apo-EGFR. We assume that gefitinib
binds in a similar fashion. In contrast, lapatinib binding to EGFR
involves several structural changes (24, 41). The EGFR-lapatinib
structure suggested that lapatinib binding may be affected by some
of the common NSCLC mutations. This report is focused on the
following seven EGFR variants, which are found in human NSCLC
tumors: D746-750 (del15), D746-753S (del18), G719C, G719S, L858R,
L861Q, and T790M. Four HER2 mutants, YVMA, G776VinsC, H878Y,
and V659E, were also characterized in this study.
Kinetic analysis of tyrosine kinase activity of wild-type and
mutant EGFR. To understand the effect of specific EGFR
mutations on EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, the kinetic variables
of EGFR variants were determined using an in vitro kinase assay.
For these experiments, the intracellular domains of wild-type EGFR
and the mutants were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus
expression system, and mutant and wild-type proteins were
purified to f80% homogeneity. The apparent K m and V max values
for ATP-Mg were determined for wild-type and mutant EGFR at a
fixed concentration of peptide substrate (Table 1). Wild-type EGFR
had a V max of 0.52 mol/min/mol. All EGFR mutants in this study
had higher intrinsic catalytic activity than wild-type EGFR. L861Q
and L858R were the most active (23- and 17-fold higher V max than
that for wild-type EGFR, respectively). The V max for G719C and
del15 was 4- and 29-fold higher than that for wild-type EGFR,
respectively. At present, the mechanism for this activation is not
known; however, all the EGFR mutants characterized here have a
higher K m for ATP-Mg than wild-type EGFR.

Estimation of mutant and wild-type K i for lapatinib and
gefitinib. The estimation of K i for lapatinib and gefitinib is
complicated because EGFR exhibits slow-binding and tight-binding
characteristics with these inhibitors. The EGFR-lapatinib interaction is defined as slow-binding because it takes a relatively long
time for the protein and inhibitor to reach equilibrium at the
concentrations used in the studies (24). The EGFR interaction
with either inhibitor is defined as tight binding because the K i
values are below the concentration of the enzyme needed to
catalyze the formation of measurable amounts of product. Under
these conditions, the enzyme-inhibitor interaction is no longer first
order, and K i must be determined using relatively complicated
experiments and data analysis methods. To account for this kinetic
behavior, we determined K i using the general analytic method
described by Morrison (32), incorporating an enzyme-inhibitor
preincubation to allow the system to reach equilibrium before
initiating the reaction with substrate (31).
The K i for the lapatinib interaction with wild-type and EGFR
del15 was determined (Fig. 1A and B). With wild-type EGFR,
increasing the concentration of enzyme used in the assay results in
a shift in the apparent IC50. This occurs because the K i app for the
inhibitor is below the concentration of enzyme, and the apparent
IC50 is increased arithmetically by a factor of [Enzyme]/2 (33). With

EGFR del15, there is no shift in the apparent IC50 with increasing
concentrations of enzyme. This occurs because the K i app value is
above the highest concentration of enzyme used in the experiment.
A global fit of these data to Eq. C gives accurate estimates of both
the K i app value and the concentration of enzyme competent for
inhibitor binding. Lapatinib and gefitinib have been shown to be
competitive with ATP (24). Therefore, the K i app values can be
converted to K i values using Eq. D. The results showed that the K i
of lapatinib for wild-type EGFR is 0.10 nmol/L; in contrast, the K i
of lapatinib for EGFR del15 is 15 nmol/L, indicating a 150-fold
decrease in the affinity of lapatinib for EGFR. The K i of EGFR
L858R is 30-fold higher than wild-type EGFR, whereas the K i values
of G719C and L861Q are slightly higher than wild-type EGFR.
Lapatinib inhibition of EGFR and ErbB2 is time-dependent due to a
very slow off rate compared with other quinazoline inhibitors such
as gefitinib (24). The off rate of lapatinib for the mutant EGFR
proteins was determined (Fig. 1C and D). We found that the
increase in K i observed with del15 and L858R corresponded to a
significant decrease in the EGFR-lapatinib half-life (Table 1). The
effects of these mutations on the K i values for gefitinib are less
pronounced (Table 1): the K i values of EGFR del15 and G719C are
slightly lower than for wild-type EGFR, whereas the other
mutations have little or no effect on the K i for the drug.

and, therefore, is shown as a dashed line. The figure was prepared

3 of the h-sheet in the NH2-terminal lobe (Fig. 2A). In the EGFRlapatinib structure, the NH2 terminus of the C helix is shifted f9 Å
relative to its position in the apo or erlotinib structures, and this
shift accommodates the larger 3-fluorobenzyl-oxy substituent in
lapatinib (Fig. 2B). It is possible that this shift at the NH2 terminus
of the C helix is accommodated by the flexible loop, and that the
shift cannot occur in EGFR mutants with a deletion in this loop.
Thus, the active conformation of the C helix might be stabilized
in EGFR del15 and del18, such that gefitinib binding would be
favorable over lapatinib binding due to steric hindrance of the
bulky head group on lapatinib.
EGFR L858R also showed a slight differential sensitivity to
lapatinib and gefitinib. L858 is located on the EGFR activation

In this study, we have estimated lapatinib K i for wild-type EGFR to
be 0.1 nmol/L. In a previous publication (24), we used a different
method to estimate the K i that generated a value of 3 nmol/L. In the
previous study, we did not include an enzyme inhibitor preincubation. Thus, the estimate was higher because the system had not
reached equilibrium during the course of the experiment. Because of
the significant time dependence of lapatinib binding, we believe that

Figure 3. Inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation
by lapatinib and gefitinib. A, CHO-K1 cells were
transiently transfected with wild-type (wt) or mutant
EGFR or HER2 constructs as indicated. Cells
transfected with EGFR constructs were incubated
with the indicated concentrations of lapatinib or
gefitinib for 4 h, stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF for
10 min, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer buffer and immunoprecipitated with
anti-EGFR antibody. Cells transfected with HER2
constructs were exposed to drug for 4 h and
immunoprecipitated with anti-HER2 antibody.
Western blot analysis and quantification was carried
out using antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT-66 as
described in Materials and Methods. Western
quantification values are shown in Table 2 and
represent at least two independent experiments.

T790 is located at the back of the ATP binding site (Fig. 2C) and is
often called the gatekeeper residue (43). This mutation is analogous
to the T315L mutation in bcr-abl that leads to imatinib resistance
(44). In the EGFR-erlotinib structure, the side chain of T790 makes a
water-mediated hydrogen bond to N3 of the quinazoline. In the
EGFR-lapatinib structure, the threonine side chain is rotated relative
to its position in the erlotinib structure and makes a number of
direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the protein. Mutation
of this residue to methionine is predicted to sterically block inhibitor
binding because the methionine side chain would occupy part of the
same space as the quinazoline ring for both inhibitors (45).
The last three EGFR mutations examined in this study, G719C,
G719S, and L861Q, have moderate effects on the K i for lapatinib or
gefitinib. Thus, it is unlikely that G719 or L861 play significant roles

loop (Fig. 2A). In the crystal structures of apoEGFR and EGFRerlotinib, the hydrophobic side chain of L858 points toward a
charged and polar region of the substrate-binding cleft. Mutation of
this residue to arginine did not lead to any structural perturbations
in the active conformation of EGFR L858R complexed with gefitinib
(42). In the crystal structure of EGFR-lapatinib, the side chain of
L858 forms part of the back pocket that binds the 3-fluorobenzyloxy substituent. Mutation of L858 to R could influence the shape
and size of the back pocket. However, because the side chain of L858
is solvent exposed in the EGFR-lapatinib structure, it seems from
the cell and enzyme data that the arginine side chain can be
accommodated. Structural studies with this mutant and related
quinazoline inhibitors indicates that the arginine side chain can
rotate and point out into solution (data not shown).

Lapatinib Inhibition of Erb Mutants

G776VinsC are less susceptible to inhibition by either lapatinib or
gefitinib. In contrast, lapatinib was a potent inhibitor (25–50 nmol/L)
of receptor autophosphorylation of the point mutation HER2 H878Y,
which has been described in hepatomas and the activating point
mutation HER2 V659E when expressed in CHO cells (Table 2).
Inhibition of wild-type and mutant cell growth by lapatinib.
The ability of lapatinib and gefitinib to inhibit proliferation of
human NSCLC cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR was
also examined. The lapatinib IC50 for cell growth varied up to 10fold in four cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR (Table 3), and the
reason for this variation is not understood. However, IC50 for cell
growth was similar for lapatinib and gefitinib in each of these four
cell lines. Two of these wild-type–expressing cell lines were tested
for inhibition of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), and both compounds were effective (Supplementary Table S1). This is consistent
with the fact that lapatinib and gefitinib have similar potency for
wild-type-EGFR inhibition. NSCLC cell lines expressing mutant
variants of EGFR were also examined (Table 3). H1650 cells,
expressing EGFR del15 and H1975 cells, which are heterozygous for
EGFR L858R and T790M, were relatively resistant to lapatinib and
gefitinib. These data are consistent with recently published reports
examining the effect of gefitinib on the growth of NSCLC cell lines
(46) and the effects of gefitinib and lapatinib on the growth of
H1975 (47). H1781S cells, expressing mutant HER2 G776VinsC,
were relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by both lapatinib
and gefitinib, although HER2 receptor autophosphorylation is
susceptible to inhibition by lapatinib (Supplementary Table S1).
CaLu-3 cells, which overexpress wild-type HER2, were highly sensitive to growth inhibition by lapatinib, with an IC50 <100 nmol/L.
Gefitinib was 4-fold less effective on that cell line (Table 3).

in inhibitor binding. Structural modeling suggested that G719C
might sterically interact with the ribose ring of ATP, perhaps
explaining the observation that the K m for ATP is f10-fold higher
for EGFR719C than for wild-type EGFR.
Inhibition of wild-type and mutant receptor autophosphorylation by lapatinib in CHO cells. The effects of EGFR mutations
on EGFR activity in cells were tested by overexpressing each EGFR
variant in CHO cells in the presence or absence of lapatinib or
gefitinib. Cultures were exposed to EGF to activate receptor kinase
activity, EGFR was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and EGFR
autophosphorylation was measured by quantitative Western blot
analyses with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The results show
that the sensitivity to lapatinib and gefitinib is similar for wild-type
EGFR and EGFR point mutants G719C, G719S, and L861Q (Fig. 3
and Table 2). The only point mutant that is differentially sensitive to
either drug is L858R, which seems to be slightly more sensitive
to gefitinib than wild-type EGFR and has about the same sensitivity
to lapatinib as wild-type EGFR. In contrast, the two EGFR deletion
mutants, del15 and del18, are much less sensitive to lapatinib
inhibition than wild-type EGFR. Gefitinib inhibits these deletion
mutants with better potency than wild-type EGFR. Interestingly,
T790M is resistant to inhibition by both drugs. These results are in
general agreement with the biochemical results described above.
Recent studies identified several HER2 mutants expressed in
tumor cells from female never-smoker Asian NSCLC patients (22).
The most common variants observed were HER2 YVMA and HER2
G776VinsC. The latter variant is also expressed in human NCI cell
line H1781. These two variants were overexpressed in CHO cells, and
receptor autophosphorylation was measured in the presence and
absence of lapatinib and gefitinib (Fig. 3B and Table 2).
Wild-type HER2 is very sensitive to lapatinib inhibition, but not
to gefitinib inhibition, as expected. However, HER2 YVMA and HER2

Discussion
Several variables contribute to the effects of ErbB family receptor
mutations on receptor oncogenicity and kinase inhibitor efficacy.
Listed in order of increasing complexity, these variables include the
effect of the mutation on (a) the affinity of the drug for the
receptor, (b) the kinetic properties of the enzyme, (c) receptor
signaling and regulation, and (d) dependence of the tumor cell on
the signal from the receptor.
At the simplest level, the mutations may result in changes in
tyrosine kinase activity and inhibitor binding. The effect of
mutations on the biochemical properties of the receptor was
obtained by purifying EGFR catalytic domains and determining
enzyme kinetic variables with an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay. The
results indicate that EGFR mutations that are common in NSCLC
are highly activating (Table 1). For example, the V max values of
EGFR L858R and del15 were 17- and 30-fold higher than for wildtype EGFR, respectively. These activating mutations may be
advantageous to tumor cell growth, which may explain why they
are frequently isolated in NSCLC. The mutations also affect drug
affinity for EGFR. The lapatinib K i was 150-fold higher for del15
and 30-fold higher for L858R than for wild-type EGFR. Modest
effects on lapatinib K i were observed for other mutants and on the
affinity of del15 for gefitinib. The effects on inhibitor K i can be
explained by structural models derived from EGFR-inhibitor
cocrystals (24, 41). Lapatinib binding seems to require a
conformational change in the apo-EGFR structure, which allows
the bulky anilinoquinazoline headgroup to protrude into the back
pocket of the enzyme. The models suggest that EGFR deletions
affecting residues 748 to 754 (del15 and del18) reduce the

From Eq. D it is apparent that a higher K m ATP will result in a
lower IC50 for a kinase inhibitor in cells even if the inhibitor K i does
not change. Using these relationships, one may predict the
expected IC50 for inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation in
cells. For lapatinib, the predicted IC50s for wild-type and del15
EGFR are 22 and 270 nmol/L, respectively. These numbers are in
very good agreement with the measured values, 22 and 361 nmol/L,
respectively.
The susceptibility of human tumor cell lines expressing EGFR
mutations to lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition was also
examined in this study. Interestingly, lapatinib-mediated inhibition
of the growth of these cell lines did not correlate directly with
biochemical and autophosphorylation data. For example, the
lapatinib IC50 for receptor autophosphorylation was reduced to
V40 nmol/L in cells expressing wild-type EGFR (H1734) and
expressing the HER2 mutation G776VinsC (H1781S), but the
lapatinib IC50 for cell growth was above 2 Amol/L. In addition,
Wang and coworkers (51) recently reported a decrease in colony
formation of H1781 tumor cells with lapatinib but at a
concentration of 5 Amol/L. Furthermore, the lapatinib and gefitinib
IC50s for cell growth both varied up to 10-fold in four NSCLC cell
lines expressing wild-type EGFR. The resistance to lapatinib shown
for the H1650 cell line is not surprising because the del15 mutation
reduces the affinity of lapatinib binding and pEGFR is not inhibited
in these cells. The reason for the low potency of gefitinib on cell
proliferation, however, is not clear, and pEGFR is effectively
reduced with gefitinib treatment in these cells. This may indicate
that the cell lines are not dependent on EGFR or HER2 for growth,
and additional factors contribute to the susceptibility of these cells
to growth inhibition by lapatinib and gefitinib.
In summary, this is the first study that we are aware of to
report biochemical, structural, and biological data on the
inhibition of common NSCLC EGFR and HER2 variants by a
dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We have fully characterized the
inhibition of intrinsic catalytic activity of receptor variants by
lapatinib through structure-, enzyme-, and cell-based assays.
Structural models of EGFR-lapatinib interactions show that the
effect of EGFR mutations also depends on the magnitude of the
effect on conformation and structural flexibility. In addition, cell
line heterogeneity modulates the sensitivity of lapatinib in EGFR/
HER2 regulation of cell growth and survival. In this study, we
show that the HER2-overexpressing NSCLC cell line was most
responsive to growth inhibition by lapatinib and is consistent
with results from clinical trials of lapatinib in patients with HER2
overexpressing breast cancer (26, 27). The biochemical and
biological data on EGFR and HER2 presented here for NSCLC
highlights the complexity of receptor sensitivity and targeted
therapies and shows how understanding the potency of specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitors toward specific receptor variants can
contribute significantly to the design, execution, and interpretation of clinical trials for these agents.

conformational flexibility of the receptor, which may prevent the C
helix from moving to accommodate lapatinib binding. Gefitinib
binds to a structure very similar to apo-EGFR and does not require
this sort of conformational flexibility and is not affected by these
variants.
Recently, other studies comparing the biochemical properties of
wild-type EGFR to EGFR harboring mutations have been published
(42, 48, 49). The kinetic properties that we have measured are in
general agreement with these reports. For example, all of these
studies report that L858R or del15 result in an increase in K m ATP
and significantly increase the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
Yun et al. (42) determined the structure of EGFR L858R in complex
with the ATP analogue AMP-PNP or the inhibitor, gefitinib. They
found that the L858R mutation seems to stabilize the active
conformation of EGFR by preventing the activation loop from
adopting the inactive-like helical conformation. Presumably, these
findings explain the increase in measured catalytic rate (V max) of this
enzyme. Yun et al. (42) also found that the structure of the EGFRgefitinib complex is in the active-like conformation, and gefitinib
binding to wild-type EGFR is identical to gefitinib binding to EGFR
L858R. In spite of this structural similarity, they found that EGFR
L858R binds gefitinib tighter than wild-type EGFR (K d = 2.6 versus
53.5 nmol/L, respectively). They propose that this increase in affinity
for gefitinib results from the stabilization of the active-like
conformation of EGFR by the mutation. In contrast, we have
obtained essentially identical K i values for gefitinib with wild-type
and L858R EGFR (K i = 0.2nmol/L for both). Our K i determinations
were obtained by measuring substrate phosphorylation in an in vitro
kinase assay and are similar to other such measurements of gefitinb
affinity to wild-type EGFR (24, 50). Yun et al. (42) determined the
inhibitor K d by measuring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the
EGFR protein induced by inhibitor addition. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that fluorescent changes are induced
by compound binding to the total population of EGFR molecules in
solution, whereas substrate phosphorylation assays are only sensitive
to inhibitor binding to the fraction of active EGFR molecules.
Because gefitinib and lapatinib compete with ATP for receptor
binding, their potency in cells depends upon several factors
including the receptor K m for ATP, the concentration of ATP in the
cell, and inhibitor K i. The relationship between these variables is
described by Eq. D (33).
