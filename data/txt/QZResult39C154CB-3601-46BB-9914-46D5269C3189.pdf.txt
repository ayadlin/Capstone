PenÔ¨Çuridol: An Antipsychotic Agent Suppresses
Metastatic Tumor Growth in Triple-Negative
Breast Cancer by Inhibiting Integrin Signaling Axis
Alok Ranjan, Parul Gupta, and Sanjay K. Srivastava

Abstract
Metastasis of breast cancer, especially to the brain, is the major
cause of mortality. The inability of anticancer agents to cross the
blood-brain-barrier represents a critical challenge for successful
treatment. In the current study, we investigated the antimetastatic
potential of penÔ¨Çuridol, an antipsychotic drug frequently prescribed for schizophrenia with anticancer activity. We show that
penÔ¨Çuridol induced apoptosis and reduced the survival of several
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. In
addition, penÔ¨Çuridol treatment signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced the expression of integrin a6, integrin b4, Fak, paxillin, Rac1/2/3, and
ROCK1 in vitro. We further evaluated the efÔ¨Åcacy of penÔ¨Çuridol
in three different in vivo tumor models. We demonstrate that
penÔ¨Çuridol administration to an orthotopic model of breast

cancer suppressed tumor growth by 49%. On the other hand,
penÔ¨Çuridol treatment inhibited the growth of metastatic brain
tumors introduced by intracardiac or intracranial injection of
breast cancer cells by 90% and 72%, respectively. PenÔ¨Çuridoltreated tumors from all three models exhibited reduced integrin
b4 and increased apoptosis. Moreover, chronic administration
of penÔ¨Çuridol failed to elicit signiÔ¨Åcant toxic or behavioral
side effects in mice. Taken together, our results indicate that
penÔ¨Çuridol effectively reduces the growth of primary TNBC
tumors and especially metastatic growth in the brain by inhibiting
integrin signaling, and prompt further preclinical investigation
into repurposing penÔ¨Çuridol for the treatment of metastatic
TNBC. Cancer Res; 76(4); 877‚Äì90. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Published studies suggest an overall reduced risk of cancer in
schizophrenic patients using neuroleptic agents (14, 15). Interestingly, few agents like chlorpromazine and thioridazine have
shown anticancer activity (16‚Äì19). PenÔ¨Çuridol is an oral antipsychotic drug available since 1970 for the treatment of schizophrenia (20). Limited studies indicate that penÔ¨Çuridol exhibits
anticancer activity; however, mechanism of the anticancer effect of
penÔ¨Çuridol is not known (21).
In the present study, we investigated the antimetastatic effect of
penÔ¨Çuridol in TNBC. We observed signiÔ¨Åcant growth suppression
of breast cancer cells by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment through inhibition
of integrin signaling. Reduced cell migration and invasion of
metastatic TNBC cells were also observed by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment. Oral administration of penÔ¨Çuridol suppressed the tumor
growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells to brain by inhibiting
integrin a6b4 signaling. To the best of our knowledge, this the Ô¨Årst
report on the antimetastatic effects of penÔ¨Çuridol targeting integrin a6b4 signaling axis in TNBC.

Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the second
leading cause of mortality (1‚Äì4). Triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) is characterized by the absence of receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) as well as lack of HER-2 gene
(5). TNBC is considered to have basal characteristics, which
are associated with more aggressive cancer phenotype (6).
TNBC is more prevalent in younger females and accounts for
about 10% to 20% of breast cancer incidence with poor
prognosis (7). Metastatic TNBC is difÔ¨Åcult to treat, thus leading to extremely poor survival. About 25% to 46% patients
with TNBC are at higher risk of brain metastasis (8). Hence it
is crucial to search new treatment options for patients with
metastatic TNBC.
Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion family receptors, which
facilitate communication of the cells with extracellular matrix
and promote cell survival (9). Accumulating evidence suggests
a major role of integrins in cancer. Integrin a6b4 has been
implicated in breast cancer progression and metastasis, making
it an attractive target for breast cancer therapy (10‚Äì13).

with 10% FBS and 5% PSN. All the cells used in this study were
within 20 passages after receipt or resuscitation.
Cytotoxicity studies
Cells were plated at a density of about 3,000 cells/well in
96-well plates and incubated overnight. The cells were then
treated with different concentrations of penÔ¨Çuridol (SigmaAldrich). After desired duration of treatment (24, 48, and 72
hours), cells were Ô¨Åxed using ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid
followed by washing with water and staining with sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye. Plates were washed with 1% solution of
acetic acid and the optical density was measured in 10 mmol/L
Tris-base solution, using plate reader (BioTek Instruments) as
described by us previously (22, 23).
Wound-healing assay
Wound-healing assay was performed as described by us earlier
(24, 25). BrieÔ¨Çy, 4T1 cells were incubated to form a monolayer in
6-well dishes. Wound was created by scratching the monolayer
with a 1-mL sterile tip. The cells were washed with sterile PBS
thrice to remove the Ô¨Çoating cells and 4 mmol/L penÔ¨Çuridol was
added to the cell culture media. The cells were Ô¨Åxed using 10%
tricholoroacetic acid at desired time points. The wound was
imaged using bright Ô¨Åeld microscope (Olympus Inc.) after staining with SRB dye as described above. The wound widths were
quantitated using ImageJ software.
Transwell cell invasion assay
Cell invasion was performed using Transwell Boyden's chamber with 8.0 mm pore size membrane (BD Biosciences). The assay
was performed according to manufacturer's instructions and as
described by us previously (24, 25). BrieÔ¨Çy, serum-starved cells
were seeded in the upper well of Boyden's chamber. The lower
chamber was Ô¨Ålled with cell culture medium containing 10% FBS
and VEGF as chemo-attractants. After 2 hours of incubation,
4 mmol/L penÔ¨Çuridol was added to upper chamber of the well.
After 24 hours of penÔ¨Çuridol treatment, cells from the upper side
of membrane were removed, whereas cells that migrated to the
lower side of the membrane were Ô¨Åxed with 10% TCA and stained
with 0.4% (w/v) SRB solution. The SRB dye was solubilized in 10
mmol/L Tris buffer and the absorbance was taken using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments).
Integrin b4 and integrin a6 silencing
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with integrin b4 shRNA
(Addgene) or integrin a6 siRNA (Cell Signaling Technologies)
using Xfect (Takara Clonetech) or siPORT (Ambion Inc.) transfection reagent as per manufacturer's protocol. BrieÔ¨Çy, 2.5 mg
shRNA plasmid was suspended in dilution buffer and Xfect
polymer was added accordingly. The complexes were added to
the cells after 10 minutes of incubation. In another experiment,
cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L integrin a6 siRNA or
scrambled siRNA using siPORT reagent and after 24 hours after
transfection, cells were treated for additional 24 hours with 6
mmol/L penÔ¨Çuridol. The cells were collected after treatment and
processed for Western blot analysis.
Laminin and TGFb treatment
Laminin (Life technologies) was diluted in PBS to attain
a Ô¨Ånal concentration of 50 mg/mL and added to the wells

878 Cancer Res; 76(4) February 15, 2016

(1 mL/well in a 6-well plate) or coverslips (500 mL/well in a
24-well plate) to cover the surface and incubated overnight at
4 C. Next day after removing laminin solution, wells were
washed with PBS followed by a wash with prewarmed cell
culture medium and the cells were plated. The cells were
processed for Western blot analysis or microscopy after 24
hours treatment with penÔ¨Çuridol.
For TGFb (Peprotech) treatment, cells were serum-starved
overnight. Following day, media were replaced with normal cell
culture media containing 10% serum and 20 ng/mL TGFb
1 hour before penÔ¨Çuridol treatment. After 24-hour treatment
with 6 mmol/L penÔ¨Çuridol, cells were collected and processed
for Western blot analysis.
Western blot analysis
The whole-cell lysates were prepared using 4% (w/v) CHAPS
in urea-tris buffer. Proteins from whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the resolved proteins were transferred to
PVDF membrane. The membranes were probed for primary
antibodies against integrin a6, integrin b4, integrin a4, integrin
av, integrin b1, integrin b3, p-FAK (Y397), FAK, p-paxillin
(Y118), paxillin, Rac1/2/3, p-Rac1 (S71), ROCK1, and cleaved
caspase-3. All primary antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technologies except integrin b4 and FAK (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The membranes were developed as
described by us previously (22, 23, 26, 27).
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed as described by us previously (10, 28‚Äì30). BrieÔ¨Çy, 0.75  106 MDA-MB-231 cells were
plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and treated with 6 mmol/L
penÔ¨Çuridol. After 24-hour penÔ¨Çuridol treatment, whole-cell
lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated
with integrin b4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).
Immune complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for integrin a6.
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from control and penÔ¨Çuridol-treated
cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to
manufacturer instructions and the cDNA synthesis was carried out
as described by us earlier (29). About 2 mg of template cDNA was
used for cycling in a thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher). The PCR
products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with 0.5
mg/mL ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light using
BioRad Versa Doc imager.
ImmunoÔ¨Çuorescence analysis
ImmunoÔ¨Çuorescence analysis was performed as described by
us earlier (26). MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in a 24-well
plate on a coverslip (uncoated or laminin coated) at a density
of 0.1  106 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight followed by treatment with 4 mmol/L penÔ¨Çuridol for additional 24
hours. The cells were Ô¨Åxed with formalin and permeabilized
using Triton-X100 solution. After blocking with goat serum,
cells were incubated overnight with primary antibody for
integrin b4 (1:150). Next day, cells were washed and incubated
with AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). After
washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides using Prolong
Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies) and
images were taken using Ô¨Çuorescence microscope (Olympus).

PenÔ¨Çuridol suppresses cell survival, cells migration, and invasion. A, MDA-MB-231, HCC1806, and 4T1 cells were treated with different concentrations of
penÔ¨Çuridol for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell survival was measured by sulforhodamine B assay to estimate IC50 values. The experiments were repeated
three times with 8 replicates in each experiment. B, 4T1 cells were grown in 6-well plates to form monolayer. Wounds were created using 1 mL sterile tip. Cell
migration capacity was measured by the time taken to heal the wound in control and penÔ¨Çuridol (4 mmol/L)-treated cells. Statistically different at
P < 0.05 when compared with control. C, 4T1 cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight before plating cells in Transwell. Invading potential of
the cells was estimated by staining the cells invaded to lower side of the membrane using sulphorhodamine B dye. Invading potential of the cells in
the treatment was compared with the control. Values were plotted as mean  SD. Experiment was repeated three times and considered statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant with control at P < 0.05.

Breast tumor orthotopic model
Female Balb/c mice (4‚Äì6 weeks old) were obtained from
Harlan Laboratories. The experiments were conducted in strict
compliance with the regulations of IACUC, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (Amarillo, TX). Exponentially
growing 4T-1 cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and
resuspended in PBS at a density of 0.7  106 cells per mL. A
suspension of 0.1 mL containing 0.07  106 cells was injected
in the inguinal mammary fat pads of each recipient mouse.
Tumor volumes were measured three times a week as described
by us previously (10, 31) and calculated using the formula
[length  (width)2/2; refs. 32, 33]. Two days after tumor cells
injection, mice were randomly segregated into two groups with
seven mice in each group. Test group of mice received 10 mg/kg
penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage every day till day 27, whereas control

mice received vehicle alone. PenÔ¨Çuridol stock was made in
DMSO, which was further diluted in water/PEG300/ethanol/
2% acetic acid in 8:3:3:1 v/v (34). Experiment was terminated
at day 27 by euthanizing mice with CO2 overdose. The tumors
were removed aseptically from each mouse, weighed, and snap
frozen in liquid-nitrogen for Western blot analysis. A part of
tumor was Ô¨Åxed in formalin for IHC analysis.
Intracardiac brain metastasis model
Female Balb/c mice (4‚Äì6 weeks old) were obtained from
Charles River and maintained as per the IACUC guidelines. For
the metastatic breast cancer model, we used a method Ô¨Årst
described by Conley and colleagues in 1979 (35) and since then
it is widely used to study metastasis to bone and brain (36, 37).

Intracranial tumor model
Female Balb/c mice (4‚Äì6 weeks old) from Harlan Laboratories
were used for intracranial injection and the experiments were
conducted in strict compliance with the regulations of IACUC,
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Exponentially
growing 4T1-luc cells were harvested, washed twice with sterile
PBS, and resuspended in PBS at a density of 5  106 cells per mL. A
suspension of 5 mL containing 0.025  106 cells were injected
by intracranial route at a Ô¨Çow rate of 1 mL/minute using Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelting Co.) in each recipient
mouse using stereotaxic apparatus. Following this, mice were

randomly divided into two groups with 6 mice in each group.
Of note, 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage was administered
to mice a day after tumor cells injection and then every day after
that. The tumor growth was monitored by noninvasive in vivo
live animal imaging as described before (24). Experiment was

serum and incubated with primary antibodies for integrin b4
(1:100), and cleaved caspase-3 (1:100) overnight at 4 C. Next
day the slides were stained using Ultravision ONE HRP Polymer Kit (Thermo Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc) as per the manufacturer's
instructions. The sections were counterstained with Mayer's
hematoxylin and dehydrated. The slides were mounted using
Permount (Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc) and imaged using Olympus microscope (Olympus America Inc.).
Dose tolerance and mice behavioral analysis
Female CD1 mice (4‚Äì6 weeks old) were obtained from
Charles River. The use of CD1 mice and their treatment was
approved by the IACUC, Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center. Mice were randomly divided into two groups with 5
mice per group. Mice were administered 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol
by oral gavage every day for 55 days. Control mice received the
vehicle only. Mice weights were monitored once a week and
mice were observed for general signs of toxicity. After 55 days
of treatment, behavioral activity of mice was assessed using
Versamax (AccuScan Instruments Inc.). Versamax is a ventilated chamber equipped with infrared sensors along the side
wall to monitor mice activity. Each mouse was acclimatized in
chamber for 15 minutes before taking the reading. The readings were taken for control and penÔ¨Çuridol treatment groups.
At the end of experiment, mice were humanely euthanized and
plasma was carefully collected for analysis of liver transaminases. The enzymatic activities of AST and ALT were determined using a commercially available kit (Pointe ScientiÔ¨Åc,
Inc.), according to manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (10). Mice organs were also collected and
weighed for comparison between control and penÔ¨Çuridol
treatment group.
Statistical analysis
Prism 6.0 software was used for all the statistical analysis
(GraphPad Software Inc.). Results are represented as mean  SD
or SEM. Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was analyzed using Student t test
or Mann‚ÄìWhitney test and outcomes were considered statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at P < 0.05.

Results
PenÔ¨Çuridol suppresses proliferation of TNBC breast cancer
cells
To evaluate the growth-suppressive effects of penÔ¨Çuridol, we
Ô¨Årst performed the cytotoxicity assay in MDA-MB-231, HCC1806,
and 4T1 TNBC cells. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of penÔ¨Çuridol for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Our results
showed that treatment with increasing concentrations of penÔ¨Çuridol signiÔ¨Åcantly suppressed the growth of all the three breast
cancer cell lines in a concentration and time-dependent manner.
The IC50 of penÔ¨Çuridol after 24 hours treatment ranged 6 to 8
mmol/L in all the three cell lines (Fig. 1A). The IC50 values were
further reduced to about 4 to 5 mmol/L and 2 to 4 mmol/L after 48
and 72 hours treatment, respectively, in all the cell lines (Fig. 1A).
These results suggest potential cytotoxic effects of penÔ¨Çuridol in
TNBC cells.
PenÔ¨Çuridol inhibits migration and invasion of breast cancer
cells
To determine the effects of penÔ¨Çuridol on metastatic potential of cells, cell migration using wound-healing assay was

www.aacrjournals.org

evaluated. Our results indicated that the migration of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated 4T1 cells was signiÔ¨Åcantly delayed as compared
with control cells. PenÔ¨Çuridol treatment inhibited the migration of 4T1 cells by 61% and 76% at 18 and 36 hours,
respectively (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the effect of penÔ¨Çuridol
on cell invasion was conÔ¨Årmed by Transwell invasion assay.
Our results showed that invasion of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated cells
was only 60% as compared with 100% in control cells (Fig.
1C). These observations indicated that penÔ¨Çuridol treatment
inhibits cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells,
suggesting antimetastatic potential.

PenÔ¨Çuridol inhibits integrin signaling
To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the growth-suppressive effects of penÔ¨Çuridol, we performed Western blot
analysis of whole-cell lysates of MDA-MB-231, HCC1806, and
4T1 cells treated with 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mmol/L penÔ¨Çuridol for
24 hours. Our results showed that expression of integrin a6 and
integrin b4 was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment in MDA-MB-231 and
HCC1806, human breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A and B).
Surprisingly, in 4T1, a murine breast cancer cells, we did not
observe much change in integrin a6 but integrin b4 expression
was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner
by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment (Fig. 2C). PenÔ¨Çuridol treatment also
reduced the expression of integrin a4, integrin av, integrin b1
and integrin b3 in concentration-dependent manner in MDAMB-231, HCC-1806, and 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
addition, we observed a notable inhibition of the downstream
effector molecules of integrin signaling such as FAK, p-paxillin
(Y118), and paxillin by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment. Integrin signaling modulates Rac and ROCK1 proteins to activate cell migration and invasion (Fig. 2A and B). Interestingly, penÔ¨Çuridol
treatment signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited p-Rac1 (S71), Rac1/2/3, and
ROCK1 expression (Fig. 2A and B). These results indicate that
penÔ¨Çuridol suppresses cell survival and motility by inhibiting
integrin signaling.
Silencing integrins a6 and b4 enhances the effects of
penÔ¨Çuridol
To conÔ¨Årm the role of integrins in penÔ¨Çuridol attributed
effects, we genetically silenced integrin a6 and b4 in MDAMB-231 cells using siRNA and shRNA, respectively. Using
siRNA, silencing 32% integrin a6 caused suppression of p-FAK
(Y397), p-Rac-1, ROCK1 (Fig. 3A), and augmented the effects of
penÔ¨Çuridol treatment on integrin signaling as well as cleavage of
caspase-3 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, using shRNA, we were able to
inhibit about 43% integrin b4 expression (Fig. 3B). Our results
further showed that silencing of integrin b4 signiÔ¨Åcantly suppressed the levels of p-FAK (Y397), Rac1/2/3 as well as ROCK1
(Fig. 3B). The effect of penÔ¨Çuridol in suppressing the level
of these molecules was further enhanced in MDA-MB-231 cells
with silenced integrin b4. A 17-fold increased cleavage of
caspase-3 was observed in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated cells with silenced
integrin b4 expression as compared with only 6-fold in the cells
with basal expression of integrin b4 (Fig. 3B). These observations prove that penÔ¨Çuridol treatment inhibits integrin a6b4
signaling to suppress breast cancer cell growth as well as migration and invasion potential.

In Vivo Suppression of Breast Cancer Metastasis to Brain by PenÔ¨Çuridol

Activation of integrins a6 and b4 signaling suppresses efÔ¨Åcacy
of penÔ¨Çuridol
We further used laminin, the ligand of integrin a6b4 and
TGFb, to activate integrin signaling and then evaluated the
effects of penÔ¨Çuridol in breast cancer cells. Our results showed
that the cells cultured on laminin-coated surface increased pFAK(Y397) and p-paxillin (Y118) by 1.10- and 1.70-fold,
respectively; however, levels of these phosphorylated protein
was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment (Fig. 3C). In
addition, increased integrin a6b4 signaling by laminin reduced
cleavage of caspase-3 induced by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment in MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, TGFb treatment also activated
integrin signaling, as exhibited by increased phosphorylation
of FAK (Y397) and p-paxillin (Y118; Fig. 3D). In line
with these observations, activation of integrin a6b4 signaling
by TGFb blocked the cleavage of caspase-3 mediated by penÔ¨Çuridol in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3D). Taken together these
results conÔ¨Årmed integrin a6b4 as targets of penÔ¨Çuridol in
suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells.
PenÔ¨Çuridol treatment disrupts integrin a6b4 heterodimer
To delineate the mechanism of inhibition of integrins, effects
of penÔ¨Çuridol on heterodimerization of integrin a6 with integrin b4 were evaluated by immunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitated integrin b4 from penÔ¨Çuridol-treated MDA-MB231 cells showed reduced association of integrin a6 with
integrin b4 (Fig. 3E). We further evaluated the effect of penÔ¨Çuridol on integrin a6 at the transcriptional level by performing PCR analysis. Our results showed that penÔ¨Çuridol treatment inhibited the mRNA levels of integrin a6 by 76% in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3F). In addition, the immunoÔ¨Çuorescence analysis also conÔ¨Årmed inhibition of integrin b4 by
penÔ¨Çuridol treatment (Fig. 3G). We also induced integrin b4
signaling by using laminin and then treated the cells with
penÔ¨Çuridol. The green staining for integrin b4 was reduced
signiÔ¨Åcantly in the cells treated with penÔ¨Çuridol or in cells
treated with laminin and penÔ¨Çuridol combination. Taken
together, these results demonstrate that integrin a6b4 are the
targets of penÔ¨Çuridol in breast cancer cells.
PenÔ¨Çuridol inhibits the growth of 4T1 orthotopic tumors
To test the efÔ¨Åcacy of penÔ¨Çuridol in vivo, we implanted
aggressive 4T1 murine breast tumor cells, representing stage
IV breast cancer, orthotopically in the mammary fat pads of
Balb/c mice and the mice were treated with 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage every day. Our results showed signiÔ¨Åcant
suppression of tumor growth in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice as
compared with control mice. At the end of experiment, average
tumor volume of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated group was about 342
mm3 as compared with 668 mm3 of control group, indicating
49% reduction in tumor volume (Fig. 4A). Tumors were col-

lected and weighed after humanely euthanizing the mice.
Average weight of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated tumors was about 42%
less as compared with control group (Fig. 4B and C). Tumor
lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. In Fig. 4D, each
band represents lysate from a separate tumor. In agreement
with our in vitro observation with 4T1 cells, no signiÔ¨Åcant
change in the expression of integrin a6 was observed in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated tumors as compared with control tumors
(Fig. 4D and E). However, a remarkable suppression of FAK,
ROCK1, Rac1/2/3, and enhanced cleavage of caspase-3 was
observed in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated tumor lysate (Fig. 4D and E).
These observations were also conÔ¨Årmed by IHC staining of
tumors from control and penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice for integrin
b4 and cleaved caspase-3. Our results demonstrated reduced
expression of integrin b4 as well as increased cleavage of
caspase-3 in tumor samples from penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice
(Fig. 4F). These results indicated that breast tumor growth
suppression by penÔ¨Çuridol was associated with inhibition of
integrin signaling and induction of apoptosis.
PenÔ¨Çuridol inhibits in vivo brain metastasis of 4T1 cells
The in vivo efÔ¨Åcacy of penÔ¨Çuridol was further validated in an
in situ metastatic breast cancer model. The 4T1-luc cells were
injected into the left ventricle of mouse heart so that the cells
lodge in the brain. Luminescence was detected in the brain of
mice within minutes of intra-cardiac injection of the tumor
cells (data not shown). Mice in experimental group received 10
mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage every day. Control mice
bearing metastatic breast tumor in brain starts succumbing
after 12 days so the experiment was terminated at day 12. Our
results showed an increase in brain luminescence starting day 6
after injection (Fig. 5A). At the end of the experiment, there was
a massive increase in luminescence signal in control group as
compared with penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice (Fig. 5A). On the basis
of luminescence, our results showed about 90% inhibition in
tumor growth by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment (Fig. 5A). At the end of
the experiment, brain from control- and penÔ¨Çuridol-treated
mice was removed and imaged. Average brain luminescence
from penÔ¨Çuridol-treated group was also suppressed by 90% as
compared with control group (Fig. 5B). The brain from control
and penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice was analyzed by IHC. Consistent
with our previous observations, tumors from penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice exhibited reduced expression of integrin b4 and
increased staining for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5C). These results
clearly indicated that penÔ¨Çuridol treatment suppressed metastatic growth of TNBC cells by inhibiting integrins and inducing
apoptosis.
PenÔ¨Çuridol inhibits the growth of 4T1 tumors in intracranial
tumor model
The antitumor effect of penÔ¨Çuridol was further validated in an
intracranial tumor model. 4T1-luc tumor cells were injected

Figure 7.
PenÔ¨Çuridol does not induce any side effects or affect behavioral activity in mice after chronic administration. Female CD1 mice were given 10 mg/kg
penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage everyday till day 55, whereas control group received vehicle only. Weight of mice was taken once a week. After terminating the
experiment at day 55, plasma from control- and penÔ¨Çuridol-treated group mice was collected and analyzed for liver transaminase. The weight of
brains, livers, kidneys, and spleens of mice was also taken and plotted. A‚ÄìG, mice weights (A), aspartate transaminase (AST; B) in the plasma, alanine
transaminase (ALT; C), and weight of brains, livers, kidney, and spleen (D‚ÄìG). Behavioral activity of mice was assessed using Versamax (Accuscan
Instruments) after 55 days of 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol administration by oral gavage every day. H‚ÄìL, clockwise revolution (H), counter clockwise revolution (I),
total distance (J), horizontal activity (K), vertical activity (L). Values were plotted as mean  SD.

directly into the brain through intracranial injection using
stereotaxic apparatus and the mice were treated with 10 mg/kg
penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage every day. Our results showed a steady
increase in brain luminescence, indicating fast tumor growth of
4T1-luc cells in the brain of control mice, whereas not much
increase of luminescence was observed in the brain of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice. At the end of the experiment (day 21),
luminescence in control mice was 3.5-fold higher than the
luminescence in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice (Fig. 6A). We also
analyzed luminescence in the isolated brains from both groups
after euthanizing the mice. Our results showed a clear suppression of tumor growth by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment as indicated by
reduced luminescence in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated brains as compared
with control brains (Fig. 6B). In addition, we also observed
reduction in average brain weight of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated group,
suggesting reduced tumor load (Fig. 6C). The isolated brains
were also examined by IHC. Consistently, we observed suppression of integrin b4 expression as well as increase in cleaved
caspase-3 in the tumors from the brain of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated
mice as compared with control mice (Fig. 6D). These results
established the growth inhibitory effects of penÔ¨Çuridol in metastatic tumors.
PenÔ¨Çuridol does not exhibit any toxicity in vivo in a chronic
toxicity model
Our in vitro and in vivo studies conclusively showed breast
tumor growth suppression by penÔ¨Çuridol in three different in
vivo models. However, it was not clear whether long-term treatment with penÔ¨Çuridol would cause any unwanted side effects or
toxicity. Hence, we studied long-term effects by treating the mice
with 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage every day for 55 days.
General signs of toxicity, such as, body weights, organ weights,
and plasma transaminases (ALT, AST) were evaluated. Our results
showed no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the overall weights of penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice as compared with control mice (Fig. 7A).
PenÔ¨Çuridol treatment modestly increased ALT activity, whereas
AST activity was reduced. The overall high basal level of AST and
ALT in our study compared with reported normal range could be
due to lysis of RBC while collection of plasma (Fig. 7B and C). We
also weighed the brains, livers, kidneys, and spleens of control and
penÔ¨Çuridol-treated mice after the experiment was terminated. No
difference in the average weights of any of these critical organs was
observed in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated group as compared with control
group of mice (Fig. 7D‚ÄìG). These results suggested that chronic
treatment with 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol was not associated with any
toxicity or side effects.
No apparent effects of penÔ¨Çuridol on behavioral activity of mice
penÔ¨Çuridol is a CNS acting drug; hence besides general signs
of toxicity, we also monitored behavioral activity of mice after
long-term penÔ¨Çuridol administration. The behavioral activity
of mice was monitored after 55 days of penÔ¨Çuridol treatment
using Versamax (AccuScan Instruments Inc.). The readings were
taken after administration of 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol every day
for 55 days. Our results showed no signiÔ¨Åcant changes in terms
of clockwise or counter-clockwise movement, total distance
covered, vertical and horizontal activity in penÔ¨Çuridol-treated
mice as compared with control mice (Fig. 7H‚ÄìL). These results
suggested that chronic administration of penÔ¨Çuridol does not
has any signiÔ¨Åcant effect on the behavioral activity of mice,
indicating that perhaps it is relatively safe for long term use.

Discussion
Our current study provides the Ô¨Årst in vitro and in vivo evidence for signiÔ¨Åcant activity of an antipsychotic drug penÔ¨Çuridol
against metastatic TNBC, a type of breast cancer, which is
currently untreatable. Our results indicated that penÔ¨Çuridol
treatment reduced the proliferation of TNBC by inhibiting integrin a6b4 signaling axis. Surprisingly, inhibition of integrin a6
was not observed by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment in 4T1, a murine
breast cancer cell line. Inhibitory activity of penÔ¨Çuridol on
integrin axis was also conÔ¨Årmed by silencing integrin a6 and
integrin b4, which further enhanced the effects of penÔ¨Çuridol in
TNBC cells. Furthermore, activation of integrin a6b4 by laminin
or TGFb, suppressed the inhibitory effect of penÔ¨Çuridol, which
was demonstrated by reduction in cleavage of caspase-3. To
determine the efÔ¨Åcacy of penÔ¨Çuridol in vivo, we used three
different tumor models. Interestingly, penÔ¨Çuridol suppressed
the growth of breast tumors in brain as well as in the breast as
evaluated in intracardiac, intracranial, and orthotopic models
respectively. Suppression of metastatic breast tumors in brain
and primary breast tumors by penÔ¨Çuridol was due to inhibition
of integrin signaling as demonstrated by Western blot analysis
and IHC staining of tumors and consistent with our in vitro
observations. Moreover, anticancer dose of penÔ¨Çuridol used in
our experiment was safe to use without any side effect or
behavioral changes as shown in our chronic toxicity study where
10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol was administered by oral gavage in mice
everyday till 55 days. Hence our study reveals a highly impressive
activity of penÔ¨Çuridol against TNBC.
Published studies indicate reduced cancer incidence with consumption of neuroleptic agents in patients with schizophrenia
(14, 15, 39). PenÔ¨Çuridol is an approved antipsychotic drug for
schizophrenia and upon administration shows good bioavailability in brain. Few studies have suggested that antipsychotic
drugs such as haloperidol, perphenazine, and Ô¨Çuphenazine have
anticancer effects. (17, 40). Consistent with those studies, our
results demonstrated the antimetastatic effects of penÔ¨Çuridol in
breast cancer model.
Wu and colleagues recently have shown the anticancer effects
of penÔ¨Çuridol by modulating cholesterol homeostasis (21). The
study showed that IC50 of penÔ¨Çuridol was between 2‚Äì4 mmol/L
after 48-hour treatment in B16/F10, LL/2, 4T1, and CT26 cells.
Similar to Wu and colleagues, we observed an IC50 of about
3.7 mmol/L in 4T1 cells at 48 hours. Our results showed an IC50
ranging between 5‚Äì8 mmol/L and 3‚Äì5 mmol/L after 24 and
48-hour treatment, respectively, in all the breast cancer cell lines
tested. In another recent study, penÔ¨Çuridol was shown to induce
apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by activating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; ref. 41). Our results also showed suppression
of cell migration and invasion by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment, suggesting antimetastatic effects in TNBC cells.
Integrins have recently gained attention as an important
therapeutic target in various cancer types (42, 43). The heterodimerization of integrin a6 with b4 plays signiÔ¨Åcant role in
breast tumor progression. In fact, overexpression of integrin
a6b4 has been observed in breast tumors (10). Our results
showed signiÔ¨Åcant suppression of integrin a6b4 by penÔ¨Çuridol
treatment. Integrin signaling is known to be mediated by
downstream activation of FAK, paxillin, Rac, ROCK proteins
(44). Interestingly, penÔ¨Çuridol treatment also inhibited the
expression as well as activation of these downstream proteins

In Vivo Suppression of Breast Cancer Metastasis to Brain by PenÔ¨Çuridol

in all the breast cancer cell lines tested. We have previously
shown that TGFb treatment increased the expression of integrin
a6, leading to reduced cleavage of caspase-3 induced by cucurbitacin B (10). In agreement, results from current study also
showed increased integrin a6 expression by TGFb treatment
and reduced cleavage of caspase-3 by penÔ¨Çuridol, indicating
integrin a6b4 as a target of penÔ¨Çuridol in breast cancer cells.
Integrin a6b4 has been shown to have role in cell migration by
laminin (45). Hence laminin-coated culture dishes were used
to evaluate the anticancer effects of penÔ¨Çuridol. Our results
showed that laminin reduced penÔ¨Çuridol-mediated suppression of integrin signaling. Interestingly, we also observed disruption of integrin a6b4 dimerization by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment. Furthermore, our results showed a signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced
mRNA level of integrin a6 by penÔ¨Çuridol treatment, indicating
that the inhibition of integrin a6 was at transcriptional level. In
addition to integrin a6b4, integrin avb3 heterodimer plays a
critical role in breast cancer metastasis to bones. Our results
showed that penÔ¨Çuridol treatment downregulated the expression of av and b3 integrin as well. These results clearly indicate
that penÔ¨Çuridol speciÔ¨Åcally inhibits integrin signaling in TNBC
cells.
PenÔ¨Çuridol is an orally bioavailable antipsychotic drug with
doses ranging from 20 to 250 mg/week. Wu and colleagues did
not observe any statistically signiÔ¨Åcant 4T1 tumor growth suppression with an oral dose of 0.06 to 0.12 mg/week/mouse (3‚Äì6
mg/kg/week) penÔ¨Çuridol in mice (21). Interestingly, our results
showed signiÔ¨Åcant tumor growth suppression in all the three
in vivo models by 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol administration every day
by oral gavage. The human equivalent dose of 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol used in mice is about 0.83 mg/kg. Moreover, 10 mg/kg
everyday administration of penÔ¨Çuridol in mice is equivalent to
1.4 mg/week. PenÔ¨Çuridol treatment substantially reduced the
establishment of metastasized breast tumors in the brain of mice
in the intracardiac model. PenÔ¨Çuridol treatment also signiÔ¨Åcantly
inhibited the growth of established breast tumors in the brain of
mice in an intracranial model. However, the inhibitory effect of
penÔ¨Çuridol was not as robust in orthotopic tumor model as
compared with intracardiac or intracranial model. The exact
reason behind the difference in efÔ¨Åcacy of penÔ¨Çuridol in different
models is not clear at this point. Consistent with our in vitro
observations, the tumor growth-suppressive effects of penÔ¨Çuridol

were associated with reduced expression of integrin b4 and increase
in cleavage of caspase-3, as evaluated by IHC in all the three tumor
models, suggesting similar mechanism. Mice did not show any
signiÔ¨Åcant behavioral side effects or any sign of toxicity when
treated with 10 mg/kg penÔ¨Çuridol by oral gavage for 55 days.
Overall, our study provides convincing results to establish
strong antitumor and antimetastatic effects of penÔ¨Çuridol in
TNBC. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the Ô¨Årst study to
demonstrate use of penÔ¨Çuridol for metastatic TNBC. Taken
together, the outcomes from our study are very encouraging as
they lay a foundation for repurposing penÔ¨Çuridol for TNBC,
which currently lacks any speciÔ¨Åc treatment options.
