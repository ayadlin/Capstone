Abstract
FET cells, derived from an early-stage colon carcinoma, are
nontumorigenic in athymic mice. Stable transfection of a
dominant-negative transforming growth factor B (TGFB) type
II receptor (DNRII) into FET cells that express autocrine TGFB
shows loss of TGFB signaling and increased tumorigenicity
in vivo indicating tumor suppressor activity of TGFB signaling
in this model. The ability of tumorigenic cells to withstand
growth factor and nutrient deprivation stress (GFDS) is widely
regarded as a key attribute for tumor formation and progression. We hypothesized that increased tumorigenicity of
FET/DNRII cells was due to loss of participation of autocrine
TGFB in a ‘‘fail-safe’’ mechanism to generate cell death in response to this stress. Here, we document that loss of autocrine
TGFB in FET/DNRII cells resulted in greater endogenous cell
survival in response to GFDS due to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/survivin pathway. Treatment of FET DNRII cells with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002)
inhibited Akt phosphorylation and reduced survivin expression resulting in increased apoptosis in FET/DNRII cells. We
also show that exogenous TGFB increased apoptosis in FET
cells through repression of the PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway
during GFDS. These results indicate that the PI3K/Akt/
survivin pathway is blocked by TGFB signaling and that loss
of autocrine TGFB leads to increased cell survival during
GFDS through the novel linkage of TGFB-mediated repression
of survivin expression. Inhibition of survivin function by
dominant-negative approaches showed that this inhibitor
of apoptosis family member is critical to cell survival in the
FET/DNRII cells, thus indicating the importance of this target
for TGFB-mediated apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3152–60]

Introduction
Transforming growth factor h (TGFh) is a group of multifunctional polypeptides that regulate a number of cellular processes
through binding to TGFh receptors. Three major types of TGFh
receptors, type I (RI), type II (RII), and type III (RIII), have been

identified in most cells (1). After TGFh binds to a heteromeric complex of RI and RII, RI is transphosphorylated by RII. The activated
RI kinase then transmits signals through Smads to regulate transcription of target genes (2, 3).
Many studies indicate that TGFh signaling can act either as a
tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor. The tumor promoter
function of TGFh has been associated with its ability to induce an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers resistance to the apoptotic effects of TGFh (4–6). Phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation has been shown to be required for
TGFh-mediated EMT, cell survival, and migration (7). Recent work
showed that TGFh activates PI3K activity through association of
TGFh RI and the p85 subunit of PI3K in its tumor promoter
function (8).
We and other investigators have shown that autocrine negative
TGFh mediates tumor suppressor activity in a variety of cancers,
including colon cancers, and that loss of autocrine TGFh activity
leads to acquisition and progression of malignancy (9–15, 33).
For example, ectopic expression of TGFh decreases breast tumor
formation in transgenic mice (16) and restoration of TGFh receptor(s) results in reduced tumorigenicity in many types of cancer
cells (11, 14, 15, 17). On the other hand, elimination of autocrine
TGFh activity in colon cancer cells by antisense TGFh transfection
or inactivation of TGFh RII by dominant-negative TGFh RII
(DNRII) transfection leads to increased tumorigenicity in athymic
mice (12, 13, 33). These studies indicate that autocrine TGFh
activity plays an essential role in tumor suppression. Therefore,
identifying the mechanism(s) by which tumor suppressor activity
is controlled is crucial for our understanding of tumor progression and for developing therapeutic strategies.
Apoptosis is an important aspect of tumor suppression. The
PI3K pathway has been shown to play an important role in
inhibition of apoptosis. Akt is an important downstream mediator
of PI3K-initiated cell survival signaling and has a number of downstream substrates whose modification by the enzyme may contribute to malignant transformation (18). Recently, Akt activation
has been linked to a member of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family,
survivin. It has been reported that Akt mediates survivin expression (19, 20). Survivin is inappropriately expressed in many types of
malignancies, including colorectal, lung, gastric, and breast cancer
(21–23). Survivin has the capacity to inhibit caspase-3, caspase-7,
and caspase-9, and its overexpression leads to resistance to apoptosis caused by various apoptotic stimuli (24).
It has been shown that TGFh induces apoptosis through a variety
of pathways in different cell types. For example, Perlman et al.
showed that TGFh-induced apoptosis is mediated by the adapter
protein Daxx that facilitates JNK activation in B-cell lyphomas and

mouse hepatocytes (25). Jang and colleagues showed that TGFh
induces apoptosis through Smad-mediated expression of the deathassociated protein kinase in Hep3B cells (26). Moreover, TGFh
induces apoptosis through Smad-dependent expression of the lipid
phosphatase SHIP in hematopoietic cells (27). Activation of Akt has
been shown to be necessary for protection from apoptosis induced
by receptor saturating levels of exogenous TGFh (28–30).
We show for the first time in this work that TGFh induces
apoptosis through repression of PI3K/Akt/survivin signaling and
that autocrine TGFh tumor suppressor activity is capable of
repressing endogenous cellular activity of Akt in response to
growth factor and nutrient deprivation stress (GFDS), thus
indicating that there may be negative crosstalk between the TGFh
tumor suppressor and PI3K/Akt pathways.
FET, a colon carcinoma–derived cell line with autocrine TGFh
activity, was isolated from a well-differentiated early-stage cancer.
FET cells form a small tumor nodule at the site of inoculation in
athymic nude mice that does not progressively grow and then
regresses over 3 to 5 weeks due to a high rate of apoptosis in the
tumor (33, 31). The inability of these colon carcinoma–derived cells
to generate progressive tumor growth in vivo suggests that, relative
to the more progressed models, FET cells retain many normal
growth controls, including inhibitory responsiveness to TGFh.
Moreover, they have normal colon epithelial cell differentiation
characteristics, such as the ability to form transport domes in tissue
culture (32). In contrast, as reported previously, FET cells stably
transfected with DNRII (FET/DNRII) do not have autocrine TGFh as
a result of the inactivation of the receptor (33). FET/DNRII cells
showed rapid and sustained tumor growth in vivo compared with
the Neo control cells (33). Thus, it seems that loss of TGFh tumor
suppressor response is permissive for the development of inappropriate growth and survival responses by the FET cells beyond their
initial immortalization. Taken together, these observations suggest
that loss of TGFh signaling enables the cells to withstand
environmental stresses, such as growth factor and nutrient
restriction that induce apoptosis in premalignant cells or early
malignant stage cells. This study uses the FET Neo and DNRII cell
model system to test the hypothesis that autocrine TGFh signaling
mediates GFDS-induced apoptosis. We show for the first time that
abrogation of autocrine tumor suppressor TGFh enables endogenous cell survival signaling in response to GFDS through a
mechanism involving activation of the PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway.
This link between loss of autocrine TGFh activity and increased
activation of Akt in the DNRII cells indicates that one aspect of
autocrine TGFh activity in its tumor suppressor context represses
PI3K signaling and thereby tips the balance between cell survival and
apoptotic signaling toward enabling apoptosis under stress conditions. Our results suggest that autocrine TGFh plays an important
safeguard during environmental stress by preventing the survival of
premalignant and/or early-stage tumor cells during the period of
stress before angiogenesis develops.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. The FET/DNRII cells were obtained by
transfection of DNRII into FET human colon carcinoma cells, whereas NEO
control cells were generated by transfection of a control plasmid as
described previously (33). FET Neo, FET/DNRII, GEO, and CBS colon
carcinoma cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 in SM medium [McCoy’s 5A serum-free medium (Sigma) with pyruvate,
vitamins, amino acids, and antibiotics] supplemented with 10 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor, 20 Ag/mL insulin, and 4 Ag/mL transferrin, as

described previously (34). When the cells were under GFDS, they were
cultured in SM medium in the absence of growth factor or serum
supplements for the indicated time periods without medium changes in
between.
Antibodies for caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology. Survivin and tubulin antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz and Research Diagnostics, Inc., respectively. Actin antibody
was from Sigma. pSmad2 antibody was from Chemicon. Caspase inhibitor
ZVAD-fmk, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and TGFh RI inhibitor were obtained
from Calbiochem.
PI3K assay. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer
[137 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L
CaCl2, 1% NP40, 100 Amol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride]. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid
protein assay reagent (Pierce). Lysates (400 Ag of protein) were incubated
with p85 antibody (Upstate) at 4jC overnight, followed by further
incubation with protein A–agarose for 2 h. Immune complexes were
washed twice with each wash buffer [PI3K wash 1, PBS 1% NP40/Na3VO4;
PI3K wash 2, 100 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4)/5 mmol/L LiCl/Na3VO4; PI3K wash
3, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4)/150 mmol/L NaCl/5 mmol/L EDTA/Na3VO4].
After the last wash was removed, PI3K assays were performed as described
previously (35). Briefly, samples were resuspended in 50 AL of PI3K buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.5 mmol/L EGTA], and
10 Ag of phosphatidylinositol were added. After 10 min at room temperature, 10 ACi of [32P]ATP and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 Amol/L
were added. After 10 min at room temperature, lipids were extracted, first
with 150 AL of CHCl3/methanol/HCl (10:20:0.2) and 100 AL of pure CHCl3.
The second extraction used 80 AL of methanol/1N HCl (1:1). Samples were
spotted on 1% potassium oxalate–treated TLC plates (Analtech) and
developed in CHCl3/methanol/NH4OH/H2O (129:114:15:21).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
NaVO3, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L DTT, 25 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 25 Ag/mL trypsin inhibitor, and 25 Ag/mL leupeptin] at 4jC.
The supernatants were cleared by centrifugation. Protein (30–100 Ag) was
fractionated on a 10% acrylamide denaturing gel and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (Life Science, Amersham) by electroblotting.
The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST [50 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] for 1 h at room
temperature or overnight at 4jC and washed in TBST. The membrane
was then incubated with primary antibodies at 1:100 to 1:200 dilutions for
1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST for 15 min, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody (Life Science, Amersham) at a 1:4,000 dilution for 1 h at room
temperature. After further washing in TBST for 15 min, the proteins were
detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham).
Apoptosis assays. FET cells were seeded in six-well plates and grown to
70% to 80% confluence. The cells were then stressed by deprivation of
growth factors for the indicated times (24–72 h) or treated with 5 ng/mL
TGFh or TGFh RI inhibitor (100 nmol/L) for 24 to 48 h. Apoptosis assays
were performed using a DNA fragmentation ELISA kit as described in the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Statistical analyses were done using
Student’s t test. Ps of <0.01 were considered significant.
FET/DNRII cells were plated in six-well plates and deprived of growth
factors to study the effects of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and TGFh RI
inhibitor on apoptosis. LY294002 or TGFh RI inhibitor was added to the
medium at a concentration of 25 Amol/L or 100 nmol/L, respectively. DNA
fragmentation assays were performed as described above.
DNA synthesis assays. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was used to
determine cell proliferation of FET Neo and DNRII cells after TGFh
treatment. The cells were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates and grown
to 60% confluence. At 48 h after TGFh treatment, the cells were labeled with
[3H]thymidine (7 ACi; 46 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) for 1 h. DNA was then
precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 0.2 mol/L
NaOH. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was analyzed by liquid
scintillation counting in a Beckman LS7500 scintillation counter.

Ecotopic expression of the wild-type and dominant-negative
survivin. Survivin dominant-negative constructs C84A (36) and D53A (37)
were generated by site-directed mutagensis and subcloned into a pBabebased retroviral vector. The 293GP packaging cells (Clonetech) were
cotransfected with pVSV-G and empty retroviral vector or retroviral vectors
containing the wild-type survivin cDNA, survivin dominant-negative C84A
or D53A cDNA. The viruses were harvested 48 h later and used to infect FET
DNRII cells.

Results
TGFB signaling inhibits PI3K activity and increases apoptosis in FET cells during GFDS. It has been reported that TGFh
increases PI3K activity through the binding of TGFh RI to the p85
subunit of PI3K in Cos 7 cells (8). However, other results indicate
that autocrine TGFh has a tumor suppressor function in colon
cancer cells (33, 9–15). This led us to hypothesize that tumorsuppressive TGFh signaling inhibits the PI3K pathway under stress
conditions that select for the malignant phenotype in vivo. To test
this hypothesis, we determined whether exogenous TGFh treatment inhibits PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation in colon
cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. We treated
TGFh-sensitive FET cells (38) with exogenous TGFh. As shown in
Fig. 1A and B, exogenous TGFh inhibited PI3K activity and Akt

phosphorylation in FET cells. Quantitation of repeat experiments
showed that 5 ng/mL TGFh inhibited f50% of PI3K activity
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) and 60% of Akt phosphorylation in FET
cells after 24 hours of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Survivin belongs to the IAP family. It has been reported that Akt
mediates survivin expression (19, 20); therefore, we determined
whether TGFh-mediated inhibition of PI3K results in diminished
expression of survivin as well. As shown in Fig. 1B, exogenous
TGFh reduced survivin expression in a concentration-dependent
manner. Quantitation of repeat experiments showed that survivin
expression in FET cells was inhibited by >50% after 24 h of TGFh
(5 ng/mL) treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Thus, these experiments provide an indication that, instead of activating PI3K,
TGFh tumor suppressor signaling inhibits PI3K activity and
phosphorylation of Akt in FET cells with concomitant inhibition
of the IAP family protein, survivin.
Given the importance of the PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway in
apoptosis/cell survival, we next determined whether exogenous
TGFh could induce apoptosis in FET cells during GFDS. FET
cells were treated with TGFh1 (5 ng/mL) while deprived of growth
factors. Apoptosis was measured by DNA fragmentation assays.
TGFh treatment increased apoptosis by 2.5-fold in FET cells after
24 hours of growth factor deprivation (Fig. 1C). Exogenous TGFh

also enhanced PARP cleavage in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner during growth factor deprivation (Fig. 1D).
These observations indicated that exogenous TGFh enhanced
apoptosis in FET cells during GFDS.
Caspase activation in FET cells by TGFB treatment. There are
two principle pathways to apoptosis called the mitochondrial
‘‘intrinsic’’ pathway and the transmembrane ‘‘extrinsic’’ pathway.
Caspase-9 is activated by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (intrinsic pathway), whereas caspase-8 is activated through
death membrane receptors (extrinsic pathway; ref. 39). To determine which caspases were activated in FET cells after TGFh treatment, Western blots were performed to detect caspase cleavage
using specific antibodies against caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively. There was a significant increase of cleaved caspase-9
fragments in FET cells after 24 hours of TGFh treatment (Fig.
2A). Caspase-8 was not activated by TGFh treatment in FET cells
(Fig. 2C). There was also a significant increase of cleavage of
caspase-3, a downstream effector caspase, after 24 hours of TGFh
treatment in FET cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, exogenous TGFh
increased cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that
exogenous TGFh-induced apoptosis during GFDS occurs through
activation of capase-9 and capase-3 in FET cells. To confirm the
role of caspase activation in TGFh-induced apoptosis, the caspase
inhibitor ZVAD-fmk was used. As shown in Fig. 2D, ZVAD-fmk

efficiently inhibited caspase-3 activation, as well as PARP cleavage
induced by TGFh treatment. This indicated that caspase activation
was critical to TGFh-induced apoptosis in FET cells. Inhibition of
caspases is thought to contribute to protection from apoptosis by
survivin (40).
Abrogation of autocrine TGFB signaling results in resistance
to GFDS-induced apoptosis. We next explored whether endogenous TGFh activity plays a role in GFDS-induced apoptosis
because it has been shown that endogenous TGFh activity, rather
than responsiveness to exogenous TGFh, is a key determinant of
tumor progression in colon cancer cells (12–14). We took advantage of the FET Neo and DNRII cell model to address this question.
FET/DNRII cells, FET cells that have been stably transfected with
DNRII, do not have autocrine TGFh nor do they respond to
exogenous TGFh as a result of the inactivation of TGFh RII (33).
This is reflected by the lack of Smad2 phosphorylation in DNRII
cells after TGFh treatment, whereas Smad2 was significantly phosphorylated in FET control cells transfected with empty vector (FET
Neo), indicating that TGFh signaling was abrogated in the DNRII
cells (Fig. 3A). DNRII cells were resistant to TGFh-induced growth
inhibition compared with the Neo control cells, further confirming
the lack of TGFh signaling in the transfected cells (Fig. 3B).
Comparison of FET Neo cells and their autocrine TGFh-null
DNRII counterpart showed that PI3K activity decayed rapidly in
the Neo cells during GFDS, whereas it remained unchanged for up

to 48 hours in the DNRII cells under GFDS (Fig. 3C). Quantitation
of repeat experiments showed that PI3K activity was reduced by
f20% and 50% in FET Neo cells after being deprived of growth
factors for 24 and 48 hours, respectively, whereas no significant
changes of PI3K activity was detected in DNRII cells under GFDS
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Consequently, phosphorylated Akt was
low in the FET Neo cells and continued to decrease dramatically
when the cells were growth factor deprived for 24 and 48 hours. In
contrast, FET/DNRII cells that had lost autocrine TGFh expressed
phosphorylated Akt at higher and more sustained levels than FET
Neo cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that loss of autocrine TGFh activity
relieved inhibitory constraints on Akt activation in the DNRII cells.
In addition, survivin expression decreased significantly during
GFDS in the Neo cells but not in the DNRII cells (Fig. 3D).
Quantitation of repeat experiments showed that Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by f30% and 60% in FET Neo cells after being
deprived of growth factors for 24 and 48 hours, respectively,
whereas survivin expression was reduced by 40% and 55% after
being deprived of growth factors for 24 and 48 hours, respectively.
No significant changes of both Akt phosphorylation and survivin
expression were detected in DNRII cells under GFDS (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These results indicated that, in its tumor suppressor
context, autocrine TGFh activity represses Akt activation and survivin expression, thereby tipping the balance between cell survival
and apoptotic signaling toward apoptosis. This was further confirmed in two other TGFh-responsive colon cancer cell lines CBS
and GEO. Consistent with increased PARP cleavage, phosphorylation of Akt and expression of survivin decreased significantly

during GFDS in these cell lines in a similar manner to FET cells
(data not shown).
To characterize the relationship between autocrine TGFh tumor
suppressor activity and cell survival signaling, we next determined
whether FET Neo cells and DNRII cells responded in the same way
to growth factor deprivation-induced stress. The DNRII cells and
Neo control cells were deprived of growth factors for 24, 48, and
72 hours, and apoptosis was measured by DNA fragmentation
assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was a significant increase of
apoptosis (up to 8-fold) in FET Neo cells compared with FET/DNRII
cells (up to 2.5-fold) during GFDS (P < 0.01). In addition, PARP
cleavage and caspase activation were measured by Western blot
assays. The appearance of cleaved PARP fragments was observed in
the Neo cells after deprivation of growth factors for 24 hours,
whereas it was not seen in the DNRII cells until 48 hours after
growth factor deprivation (Fig. 4B). There was a significant
increase of cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 after 48 hours of
growth factor deprivation in FET Neo cells but not in FET/DNRII
cells (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that the DNRII cells were
more resistant to GFDS-induced apoptosis than the Neo control
cells. They also suggest that autocrine TGFh plays an important
role in GFDS-induced apoptosis.
To further confirm the role of autocrine TGFh in GFDS-induced
apoptosis, we treated FET cells with a TGFh RI inhibitor
(Calbiochem) to abrogate TGFh signaling. The RI inhibitor is a
cell-permeable ATP-competitive inhibitor of TGFh RI kinase. It
has been shown to be potent and selective for inhibition of TGFh
signaling (41). As shown in Fig. 5A, the RI inhibitor effectively

inhibited Smad2 phosphorylation induced by TGFh treatment,
indicating that TGFh signaling was blocked by the RI inhibitor.
We next explored whether inhibition of TGFh signaling would
restore Akt phosphorylation and survivin expression in FET cells.
We found that treatment of FET cells with 100 nmol/L RI inhibitor
led to increased Akt phosphorylation and survivin expression
during GFDS (Fig. 5A and B, lanes 1 and 3). Quantitation of re-

peat experiments showed that Akt phosphorylation and survivin
expression were increased by f1.6-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively,
in FET cells after treatment with the RI inhibitor (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). The RI inhibitor not only increased survivin expression in
the absence of exogenous TGFh, it also antagonized exogenous
TGFh-mediated inhibition of survivin expression (Fig. 5A), suggesting that TGFh plays a role in regulation of survivin expression,

perhaps, through its effects on Akt. As a result, the RI inhibitor
protected FET cells from GFDS-induced apoptosis as reflected by
DNA fragmentation assays (Fig. 5C). Of note, the RI inhibitor did
not have any effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and c-Jun NH2 kinase (JNK) activation (data not shown), indicating
the specificity of the inhibitor. Taken together, these results
indicated that autocrine TGFh mediates GFDS-induced apoptosis
through suppression of the PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway.
The PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway is critical for increased
survival in the DNRII cells. Loss of TGFh signaling enables the
DNRII cells to have relatively high and sustained Akt activation during GFDS, which might be responsible for their resistance
to GFDS-induced apoptosis. To show that PI3K/Akt is critical
for enhanced survival in the DNRII cells, we used the potent
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block the enzyme activity. LY294002
was added to FET/DNRII cells when they were deprived of
growth factors. LY294002 inhibited Akt activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), indicating that the PI3K
pathway was blocked by LY294002. Blockade of PI3K/Akt activation resulted in decreased survivin expression (Fig. 6A), which
is consistent with previous reports that PI3K/Akt mediates survivin expression (19, 20). Quantitation of repeat experiments
showed that 48-hour treatment of LY294002 (25 Amol/L) inhibited
Akt phosphorylation and survivin expression by f50% and 60%,
respectively, in FET/DNRII cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Activation of MAPK and JNK was determined after LY294002 treatment to show the specificity of the inhibitor. As a result, LY294002
had no effect on their activation (data not shown). We next
determined the effect of LY294002 treatment on apoptosis induced
by GFDS. DNA fragmentation assays showed that treatment
with LY294002 increased apoptosis by 2-fold at 24 hours and by
2.8-fold at 48 hours after deprivation of growth factors in FET
DNRII cells (Fig. 6B, top). PARP cleavage, caspase-3, and caspase-9
activation were also increased in FET/DNRII cells in a concentration-dependent manner after LY294002 treatment (Fig. 6B,
bottom). Forced expression of survivin protected FET/DNRII cells
from LY294002-induced apoptosis during GFDS (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, survivin dominant-negative constructs C84A (36) and
D53A (37) sensitized FET/DNRII cells to GFDS-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 6D). These results indicate that inhibition of the PI3K/survivin pathway restored the sensitivity of the DNRII cells to GFDSinduced apoptosis and that PI3K/Akt/survivin signaling plays an
essential role in the resistance of DNRII cells to GFDS-induced
apoptosis. In summary, our results show that autocrine TGFh
tumor suppressor is responsible for GFDS-induced apoptosis by
inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway. Loss of this repressive function enables the induction of inappropriate endogenous cell survival signaling (i.e., PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway),
which leads to increased survival in response to cellular stress.
This could play an important role in both tumor initiation and
progression.

Discussion
The autocrine hypothesis was introduced originally for positive
growth factors, such as TGFa, to account for the growth advantage of malignant cells over their normal counterparts (42). On the
other hand, TGFh has been shown to be an autocrine-negative
growth factor, as evidenced by stimulation of growth of several
cell lines treated with TGFh-neutralizing antibody (11–14). Therefore, loss of autocrine TGFh could also provide malignant cells

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

a growth advantage. Previously, we showed that repression of
autocrine TGFh activity by TGFh1 antisense transfection led to a
robust malignant phenotype as reflected by the ability to form
large xenografts compared with the control cells that failed to
grow progressively in vivo due to the high intrinsic apoptosis.
Importantly, the cells targeted by this antisense approach retained
the ability to respond to any exogenous TGFh available because
the TGFh receptors were still intact (12, 13). Moreover, inactivation of TGFh RII also led to increased tumorigenicity in athymic
mice (33). In contrast, restoration of autocrine-negative TGFh
activity by replacing mutationally inactivated TGFh RII with
the wild-type RII resulted in reduced cell proliferation and diminished tumorigenicity (14, 15). However, responsiveness to growth
inhibition by exogenous TGFh in tissue culture was not reestablished, indicating that endogenous TGFh activity was sufficient for tumor suppression (14, 17). Taken together, this series
of studies indicated that autocrine-negative TGFh activity rather
than exogenous TGFh is necessary and sufficient to deter
malignant progression in human colon carcinoma cells in vivo.
However, the mechanisms underlying autocrine TGFh tumor
suppressor activity in relation to apoptosis remain largely
unknown. Therefore, exploration of the mechanisms by which
autocrine TGFh induces apoptosis is important for our understanding of the carcinogenic process and malignant progression.
The present study suggests that endogenous TGFh activity acts
as an intrinsic fail-safe system to initiate cell death and prevent
malignant progression through inappropriate activation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway.
Several studies have shown that exogenous TGFh induces
apoptosis in a variety of cell types through different mechanisms
(25, 26, 45). However, thus far, there are no studies characterizing
autocrine-negative TGFh in cell survival. We have made the novel
observation that endogenous cellular TGFh signaling increases
apoptosis during GFDS and that loss of autocrine TGFh in FET
DNRII cells resulted in increased PI3K/Akt activation and survivin
expression, as well as resistance to GFDS-induced apoptosis. This
mechanism of inducing apoptosis by suppressing cell survival
signaling is different from mechanisms that induce apoptotic
signaling in other cell systems, for example, TGFh induces
apoptosis by DPC4 through stress-activated protein kinase/JNK
signaling pathway in pancreatic carcinoma (46). Moreover, it has
also been shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and
c-Src kinases are involved in TGFh-induced apoptosis in FaO
hapatoma cells (47, 48). Taken together with its role in malignant
progression, the effect of autocrine-negative TGFh on apoptosis
provides another important mechanistic basis for its tumor
suppressor activity. The linkage of this apoptotic mechanism in
human colon cancer cell lines to repression of survivin expression
may be of significance, because survivin, which is generally not
expressed in differentiated cells, is strongly associated with poor
prognosis in colon cancer (49).
It has been recently reported that, in Cos7 cells, exogenous TGFh
activates PI3K through a mechanism by which TGFh receptor RI
binds to the p85 subunit of PI3K and activates the kinase (8). The
activation of the PI3K pathway by TGFh is associated with tumorpromoting effects of TGFh, including its ability to induce an EMT,
which confers resistance to the apoptotic effects of TGFh (4–6).
PI3K/Akt activation has been shown to be required for TGFhmediated EMT, cell survival, and migration (7, 50). In contrast,
our study shows that TGFh also represses PI3K/Akt activation,
which contributes to its tumor suppressor function.

There is a fine balance between cell survival and apoptotic signaling, which is maintained by oncogenes and tumor suppressors.
Activation of oncogenes (i.e., PI3K) and/or inactivation of tumor
suppressors (i.e., TGFh) are involved in promoting cell survival during tumorigenicity and metastasis. The ability of malignant cells to withstand environmental stresses is considered a
key factor in tumor development and progression (51). Escape
from TGFh-mediated apoptosis may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis through an enhanced survival capacity under conditions of poor blood supply or in the initial
formation of metastatic colonies. Because environmental restriction on growth seems to be common in solid tumors, such as colon
carcinoma, a mechanism for escape from an autocrine-negative

control that enables cell survival signaling would be highly
advantageous to malignant cells. Here, we have shown that abrogation of autocrine TGFh enables increased PI3K/Akt activation in
FET/DNRII cells under GFDS, which shifts the balance toward
survival, and this is the basis for resistance of the cells to GFDSinduced apoptosis.
