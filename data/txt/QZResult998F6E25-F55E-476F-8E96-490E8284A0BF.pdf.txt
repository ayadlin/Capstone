BACKGROUND. The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with highdose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) has resulted in durable tumor regression in a
minority of patients. The current study presents the authors’ 20-year experience
administering this immunotherapeutic agent.

METHODS. Patients with metastatic RCC (n 5 259) were treated with HD IL-2
alone from January 13, 1986 through December 31, 2006 at the Surgery Branch of
the National Cancer Institute. Potential predictive factors for response and survival, both pretreatment and treatment-related, were first subjected to univariate
analysis and then to multivariate logistic regression or a Cox proportional
hazards model. Finally, the authors investigated Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC) prognostic factors for survival to assess their predictive value in
the patient population in the current study.

RESULTS. A total of 23 patients experienced a complete response and 30 patients
achieved a partial response, for an overall objective response rate of 20%. All partial responders had developed disease recurrence at the time of last follow-up,
but only 4 complete responders had experienced disease recurrence by that time.
Despite toxicities, only 2 patients developed treatment-related mortalities over
this same time period. A higher baseline weight (P 5 .05) and MSKCC prognostic
factors (P 5 .02) were found to be the variables most associated with response.
For survival >4 years and overall survival, several pretreatment and treatmentrelated factors maintained significance, but none more so than response
(P < .0001).

CONCLUSIONS. HD IL-2 can induce complete tumor regression in a small number
of patients, and many patients have experienced extended disease-free intervals.
Given its relative safety, HD IL-2 should still be considered a first-line therapy in
patients with metastatic RCC who have an overall good performance status.

y current estimates, approximately 51,000 individuals in the U.S.
will have been diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in
2007 and 1 in 74 men and women will receive this diagnosis during
their lifetime. Over the last 20 years, there has been a significant
increase in the incidence of RCC. Although 5-year survival for disease diagnosed at stage I (T1a-T1bN0M0: tumor up to 7 cm in
greatest dimension [T1a-T1b], no regional lymph node metastasis
[N0], and no distant metastasis [M0]) is near 90%, the expected 5year survival for patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis is approximately 10%.1,2 Despite its relatively dismal progno-

sis, metastatic RCC has paradoxically been one of the
few solid human tumors that can still be cured after
metastasizing widely. Since the inception of its use in
the mid-1980s, treatment with high-dose interleukin2 (HD IL-2) has resulted in complete and durable
tumor regressions and long-term survival in a small
percentage of patients with metastatic RCC.
Based on our single-institution experience and
the results from 21 other sites, in 1992 the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of
HD IL-2 for patients with metastatic RCC. Over the
last 20 years, our group and others have attempted
to enhance the effectiveness of HD IL-2 by modifying
it using polyethylene glycol to extend its half-life or
combining it with interferon-a (IFN-a), lymphokineactivated killer (LAK) cells, or several chemotherapy
agents.3–7 In addition, attempts have been made to
mitigate the toxicities of HD IL-2 by using lower
intravenous doses or administering it as a subcutaneous injection.8–10 Despite these efforts, randomized
studies have failed to demonstrate that any of theses
various combinations were superior to HD IL-2
administered intravenously alone.11 Thus, HD IL-2
remains the standard IL-2–based treatment for eligible patients with metastatic RCC.
Multiple studies have demonstrated that HD IL-2
can produce an objective response rate of approximately 20% in patients with RCC. Complete tumor
regressions can occur in 7% to 10% of patients and
are generally durable, with nearly all patients
remaining free of disease up to 20 years after therapy. Although more common at approximately 10%
to 15%, partial responses have not been reported to
be as durable and the majority of patients develop
disease recurrence within 2 years.3,12,13 Given that a
minority of patients achieve a major benefit, many
groups have attempted to identify prognostic factors
that might help predict response or clarify the biologic mechanisms involved.14,15 In the current study,
we updated and reviewed our single-institution experience with HD IL-2 in the treatment of 259 patients
with metastatic RCC. We reanalyzed variables that
might be associated with response in this cohort
receiving only HD IL-2 and added an analysis of factors associated with prolonged survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients included in the current study all had measurable metastatic RCC and were treated at the
Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) between January 13, 1986 and December 31,
2006. Although only patients with RCC of clear cell

histology were considered for treatment, this
included tumors with sarcomatoid, granular, and
mixed papillary elements. Specifically, pure papillary,
collecting duct, medullary, and chromophobe tumors
were excluded. All patients had received no other
therapy for at least 4 weeks before beginning treatment with HD IL-2. Before enrolling, all patients
were evaluated with routine physical examination,
history, and screening blood studies. In the early
years, radiologic workup included computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest as well as bone and liver
scans, whereas in later years patients were routinely
evaluated with CT studies of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
of the brain. In addition, patients age >50 years were
required to undergo a pretreatment stress electrocardiogram or a stress radionuclide study. Those patients
found to have evidence of ischemic heart disease, significant arrhythmias, or other comorbidities were
excluded. All patients provided informed consent
before protocol enrollment. The Institutional Review
Board of the NCI approved all protocols.
Patients were not included in this review if they
had received any prior treatment with IL-2, IL-2 conjugated to polyethylene glycol, or IL-2 in combination with any other agent.

Interleukin-2
Recombinant IL-2 (Cetus Oncology Division, Chiron
Company, Emeryville, Calif) was reconstituted from a
lyophilized powder with 5% human albumin. The
drug was then administered intravenously at a dose
of 720,000 IU/kg over 15 minutes every 8 hours as tolerated up to a maximum of 15 doses. In recent years,
the maximum limit was reduced to 12 doses because
very few patients were able to tolerate 15 consecutive
doses. Patients withdrew from treatment before reaching the maximum number of doses because of their
refusal to continue treatment, early signs of mental
confusion, or because of grade 3 and 4 toxicities that
were not easily reversed by supportive therapy (determined according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria grading system).
After the initial treatment cycle, patients
returned 10 to 15 days later for a second cycle administered in the same fashion if possible. Two cycles
constituted 1 course of treatment. Patients with evidence of tumor regression or those with stable disease after a course of therapy would then proceed to
additional courses of treatment beginning every 2
months. The majority of patients received their treatment on a general surgical ward, although some
patients were transferred to the intensive care unit
for monitoring or if vasopressor therapy was war-

ranted. Common side effects from HD IL-2 were prevented or minimized by the routine administration
of antipyretics, anti-inflammatories, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and H2 antagonists.

Evaluation of Response
All metastatic lesions were measured by either radiologic or physical examination. Initially, responses
were calculated using the World Health Organization
criteria. These guidelines consider a partial response
to be a 50% reduction in the sum of the products
of the maximum perpendicular dimensions of all
lesions lasting at least 4 weeks with no new or growing lesions. A complete response was defined as the
complete disappearance of all known lesions confirmed to last at least 4 weeks. Progressive disease
was defined by WHO criteria as a 25% increase in
the product of the perpendicular dimensions of any
pre-existing lesions or the development of any new
lesions.16 In 1998, the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors was proposed by the RECIST group.
RECIST classifies a partial response as a 30%
decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the
target lesions. A 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions or the development of any new lesions are classified as progressive
disease.17 The current study includes patients measured using the criterion appropriate for the time during which their treatment was administered.
Statistical Analysis
Data were initially evaluated in a univariate fashion.
For continuous variables, comparisons between
responders and nonresponders and between those
patients surviving > 4 years or <4 years were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Four years
was chosen based on the stabilization of the overall
survival curves at approximately this time point after
the initiation of treatment. The same comparisons
between dichotomous variables were performed using
either the Fisher exact test or the Mehta and Patel
modification to the Fisher exact test.18 Those factors,
which were potentially identified to be associated
with either response or survival >4 years on univariate analyses, were then included in a multivariate
logistic regression model to determine whether any of
these factors may have a simultaneous association
with either of the 2 outcomes. All P values were 2sided with statistical significance being considered
when P was <.05. The results are reported without
any formal correction for multiple comparisons
because the analysis was intended to be descriptive.
While analyzing variables that might predict
survival, we also incorporated the Memorial Sloan-

Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic factors
as reported by Motzer et al.19 These negative prognostic factors included poor Karnofsky performance
status, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, low
hemoglobin, high corrected calcium, and lack of
prior nephrectomy. Normal limits for laboratory
values were defined by the central laboratory of the
NCI and some varied during the length of the current
study as methodologies changed. Because Motzer
et al.19 determined that survival with metastatic RCC
differed according to the aggregate number of factors
each patient possessed, the Cochran-Armitage test
for trend was used to analyze the association
between the actual number of factors (ie, 0, 1–2, or
>3) and survival of >4 years versus <4 years.20
Finally, to determine whether these factors and
others were associated with overall survival, a Cox
regression analysis was performed.

was between 24 and 221 months.
For all 259 patients, the median overall survival
was 19 months. Figure 2 demonstrates the differences in survival between the complete and partial
responders and nonresponders. Based on groups that
were determined retrospectively, the median survival
of the partial responders and nonresponders was
39.1 months and 15.1 months, respectively, from the
on-study date. The median survival of the complete
responders had not yet been reached at the time of
last follow-up. Response was observed at a variety of
sites, including the lung, liver, bone, and lymph
nodes.

our patients were men between the ages of 40 and
60 years. Greater than 75% of the patient population
in the current study were of good performance status, with an ECOG classification of 0. Only 6 of the
259 patients had not received any previous therapy.
The overwhelming majority had undergone surgery
and approximately 15% had received previous immunotherapy, with the majority of these patients having
received IFN-a.

Response to Therapy and Overall Survival
Of the 259 patients in this study, 23 (9%) experienced
a complete response and 30 patients (12%) achieved
a partial response, for an overall objective response
rate of 20%. The response durations are shown in
Figure 1 and Table 2. All patients who experienced a
partial response ultimately developed disease recurrence, with a median duration of response of 15.5
months. In contrast, of the 23 complete responders,
only 4 had developed disease recurrence at the time
of last follow-up, all within the first 4 years after the
initiation of treatment (Table 2). Three other ongoing
complete responders were censored at 141 months,
88 months, and 46 months because of death from
other causes. Of the remaining 16 ongoing complete

Toxicities
There were 2 treatment-related deaths during the
time period of the current study. These occurred
early in the course of our experience and there has
not been a death related to HD IL-2 toxicity in a
patient with RCC reported in 20 years. Hematologic
toxicities were generally limited to grade 1 and grade
2 and included decreases in serum hemoglobin, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (Table 3). Hepatic
toxicities included grade 1 and grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia and elevations in aspartate aminotransferase.
Other grade 1 and grade 2 toxicities included edema,
chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, diarrhea, and nausea.
Because of the capillary leak syndrome, vasodilation,
and diarrhea that HD IL-2 therapy can cause,
patients often experienced hypotension and oliguria.
Confusion and a depressed level of consciousness
were among the other major grade 3 and grade 4
toxicities. Grade 3 and grade 4 infections, both catheter-related and in general, are believed to be because
of neutrophil dysfunction from IL-2 but have become

relatively uncommon with the given routine use of
prophylactic antibiotics for indwelling devices.21
Overall, grade 3 and grade 4 toxicities have diminished significantly since we began treating patients
with HD IL-2. When comparing the first 65 and the
last 64 patients who were treated, grade 3 and grade
4 toxicities were found to have diminished from 209
and 48, respectively, to 56 and 6, respectively. Finally,
apart from the 2 treatment-related deaths, all toxicities were readily reversible after the discontinuation
of therapy.

Prognostic Factors Associated with Response to IL-2
First, it should be noted that a large number of pretreatment factors were not found to be associated
with response. As can be seen in Table 4, only fewer
MSKCC risk factors (P 5 .02), a higher baseline

297

weight (P 5 .05), and a lack of prior immunotherapy
(P 5 .05) were found to be significantly associated with
response to HD IL-2. Sites of disease were studied to
determine their possible association with response.
Again, no individual site of disease demonstrated statistical significance. However, there was a weak trend
toward a higher response rate in those patients who
had undergone a prior nephrectomy (P 5 .12).
Treatment-related variables, including laboratory
parameters assessed during treatment, also were evaluated for response. The analysis of the correlation
between IL-2 doses and response required several
refinements to avoid unintentional biases. Because
the number of total doses a patient received was
biased by the finding that only patients responding to
treatment receive additional courses, we examined
only the number of IL-2 doses in the first and second
cycles of the first course, the total number of IL-2
doses in the first course, and the total IU/kg of the
drug received in that first course. Of these factors,
only the total IU/kg of IL-2 received during that first
course was found to be associated with response
(P 5 .04 on the univariate analysis). This variable was
then included along with the previously mentioned
significant pretreatment factors in a multivariate
analysis, but it did not maintain its significance.

Prognostic Factors Associated with Survival >4 Years
Analyses for this outcome were restricted to the 249
patients who were not enrolled on study <4 years
before December 2006 and who remained alive at the
time of last follow-up because the outcomes of the
other 10 patient with respect to this endpoint were
not determined. Again, a multitude of pretreatment
variables were assessed and found not to be associated with survival of >4 years. Of those variables
that were, only fewer sites of metastatic disease (P 5
.0014) and a higher baseline albumin (P 5 .004) were
found to maintain statistical significance (Table 4).
The analysis was then performed examining
treatment factors. Univariate treatment factors found
to be predictive of survival of 4 years were included
along with sites of disease, baseline albumin, and
response to HD IL-2 in a logistic regression model.
Again, fewer sites of disease (P 5 .004) and a higher
baseline albumin (P 5 .0007) remained statistically
significant. In addition, a higher rebound lymphocytosis (P 5 .002), lower peak thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) (P 5 .012), and response (P < .0001)
were found to be strongly associated with survival of
>4 years. Of these 5 factors, however, a partial or
complete response to HD IL-2 emerged by far as the
strongest predictor of survival of >4 years with 31 of
50 responders (62%) surviving >4 years compared

with just 22 of 199 nonresponders (11%) achieving
that milestone. Incidentally, as with response, there
was no apparent association between survival of >4
years and the total doses or IU/kg of HD IL-2
received.
Similar to the previous logistic regression model,
a higher baseline albumin (P 5.0063), lower peak TSH
(P 5 .0005), response (P < .0001), lower platelet nadir
(P 5.0003), and better ECOG performance status (P 5
.0035) were factors that were considered to be predictive of longer overall survival in the Cox model (Table
5). Of most significance, there was strong association
between response to HD IL-2 and long-term survival
(P .0001). Although the addition of the MSKCC score
did not obviate the significance of any of the other 5
factors in the Cox model, it was itself not found to be

DISCUSSION
The goals of the current study were to update our
20-year experience administering HD IL-2 for the
treatment of patients with metastatic RCC. As of December of 2006, we had treated 259 patients with
this immunotherapy agent. Approximately 9% of our
patients (n 5 23) experienced a complete response
and 11% (n 5 30) achieved a partial response, for an
overall objective response rate of 20%. With what to
our knowledge is the longest follow-up currently
available, this study demonstrates that the majority
of patients achieving a complete response are likely
cured, with 19 of 23 complete responders remaining
free of disease at 24 to >221 months from the onset
of treatment (Fig. 1) (Table 2). Although all partial
responders do develop disease recurrence with time,
these individuals also appear to derive some benefit
from their treatment.
Analyzing associations between multiple parameters and clinical outcome after IL-2 therapy is hampered by relatively small sample sizes and a low
frequency of response or long-term survival. Analyses
of numerous parameters without corrected P values
are likely to misidentify chance associations as being
significant whereas strict corrections applied to P

values across multiple analyses and for parameters
with varying degrees of association with one another
may mask genuine associations as being nonsignificant when examining the results from trials with small
numbers of subjects. Therefore, it is of value to examine what parameters were found to be significantly
associated with response and survival in independent
studies by other investigators (Table 4).11–15,22,23
Because to our knowledge the current study encompasses the most recent and largest retrospective
analysis of patients with metastatic RCC published to
date, we added an analysis of the MSKCC risk factors
to our study of variables associated with improved
response and survival. Motzer et al.19 originally identified these risk factors in a retrospective analysis of
670 patients with metastatic RCC who were treated
at a single institution over a 21-year period. Of these
670 patients, 102 had been treated with IL-2 alone or
in combination with IFN-a. The primary purpose of
the study was to define pretreatment factors predictive of survival. A high LDH level (>1.5 times normal), low Karnofsky performance status (<80%), low
serum hemoglobin (< the lower limit of normal),
high corrected calcium, and an absence of nephrectomy were considered to be risk factors for shorter
survival.19 Applying this list to their patient population, the authors found that patients having none of
the identified risk factors had a median survival of 20
months, whereas those with 1 or 2 risk factors had a
median survival of 10.3 months; subjects with 3, 4,
or 5 risk factors experienced a median survival of
only 3.9 months.19
In a regression model limited to pretreatment
variables, we found that fewer MSKCC risk factors were
correlated more significantly with response to HD IL-2
(P 5 .02) rather than survival. Admittedly, MSKCC risk
factors include parameters that individually were
either not found to be statistically significant on the
univariate analysis (ie, prior nephrectomy, LDH level,
performance status, and corrected calcium) or lost
significance on the multivariate analysis (ie, baseline
hemoglobin). However, when applied to the current
study patients as a group, these variables appear to
be strong pretreatment predictors of response. With
regard to the association between a higher baseline
weight and response, the related factors of the total
amount of IL-2 and the body mass index were found
to be only marginally associated with response, suggesting that neither was the sole factor contributing
to the association observed.
None of the parameters elicited during treatment
proved to be significantly associated with response.
Several sequential analyses by the NCI Surgery
Branch have identified no prior immunotherapy and

299

a greater rebound lymphocytosis (here, peak minus
baseline lymphocyte count) as being associated with
a higher frequency of response to IL-2. Furthermore,
because 23 of 46 patients with prior immunotherapy
had received IFN-a, we also examined this subset of
patients individually and found, on the univariate
analysis, the suggestion of an association between
response and an absence of previous IFN-a therapy
(P 5 .05). Thus, although there may be some suggestion that prior immunotherapy could be detrimental
to achieving a response with HD IL-2, it remains
unclear whether treatment with other immunotherapeutic agents before HD IL-2 should be discouraged.
Although Upton et al., Atkins et al., and others
have found molecular and histologic features of clear
cell renal cancer to be predictive of a higher chance of
response, our treatment population was strictly limited to patients with clear cell tumors, potentially
negating this consideration in the current study.22–24
The analysis of factors associated with prolonged
survival after HD IL-2 therapy had not previously
been performed on our entire cohort of patients
receiving HD IL-2 monotherapy. Because the majority of patients do not appear to benefit in any discernable way from HD IL-2 therapy (although a
minority appear to demonstrate durable survival as
evidenced by stabilization of survival curves), we
chose to study survival of >4 years rather than
median survival as a way to determine factors that
might identify those patients who receive the greatest
benefit from HD IL-2 treatment. The number of
MSKCC risk factors demonstrated only a trend but
no significant association with prolonged survival in
the current study population, but our patients were
fewer and less diverse than those studied by Motzer
et al,19 which hampers our ability to detect significant associations across these categories. Other significant survival-associated factors in the current
study were fewer sites of disease, a higher baseline
albumin, higher rebound lymphocytosis, a lower
peak TSH, lower ECOG PS, and a lower platelet nadir.
It was reassuring to note that a response to HD IL-2
was by far the dominant factor associated with prolonged survival, dwarfing all other factors with regard
to significance and relative risk. Conversely, it was
important to note that the factors associated with a
higher probability of response were not sufficient to
also be associated with prolonged survival. The treatment-related factors of rebound lymphocytosis and
platelet nadir have previously been described, and
most often associated with a superior response rate,
but as known hematologic consequences of HD IL-2
administration they could simply be surrogates for a
brisk response to IL-2. Similar to the current study,

Palmer et al. also found fewer sites of disease to be a
predictor of survival.14 To our knowledge, the significance and interpretation of the association between
survival and baseline albumin and the inverse association between survival and peak TSH remain unexplained and not previously described.
Within the last few years, new agents have been
approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC. These
include tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib
and sorafenib, as well as the rapamycin kinase inhibitor temsirolimus. In phase 3 trials, sunitinib and sorafenib produced response rates of 31% and 10%,
respectively. In addition, both demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival and
trends toward improved survival.25,26 Temsirolimus
demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in
comparison with IFN-a.27 Beyond their demonstrated efficacy, the appeal of these agents is their
ease of administration and lack of acute or severe
toxicities. However, extensive experience has shown
that they rarely, if ever, induce complete regressions
of metastatic RCC and require chronic, ongoing therapy if tumor stability or regression is to be maintained. In contrast, a relatively brief course of HD IL2 therapy can result in durable complete regressions
in a small population of treated patients and no
maintenance therapy is required to preserve these
responses. In experienced centers, the risk of a HD
IL-2 treatment-related death has been reduced to
<1% and all other toxicities are subject to rapid reversal after the completion of therapy.
The results of this and other studies have shown
that HD IL-2 is the only systemic treatment that can
consistently cure a small percentage of patients with
metastatic RCC. Because such successes are not common, efforts to identify those patients with the best
chance of benefiting are important to avoid unnecessary treatment and to better triage patients between
the therapeutic choices now available. Choosing a tyrosine kinase inhibitor confers a higher likelihood of
achieving disease regression or stability, but current
data do not support the potential of a curative
response with these agents. One could argue that for
patients with the highest potential for responding to
HD IL-2, this should be their first-line option, with a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor selected if HD IL-2 is not
effective. The results of the current study would suggest such patients would be those with a superior
MSKCC score and no prior immunotherapy.
