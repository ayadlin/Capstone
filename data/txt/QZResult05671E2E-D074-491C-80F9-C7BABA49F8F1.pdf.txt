Abstract
Acquired resistance to EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a critical problem in the
treatment of lung cancer. Although several mechanisms have been shown to be responsible for acquired
resistance, all mechanisms have not been uncovered. In this study, we investigated the molecular and
cellular proﬁles of the acquired resistant cells to EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant lung cancers. Four EGFRmutant cell lines were exposed to geﬁtinib by stepwise escalation and high-concentration exposure
methods, and resistant sublines to geﬁtinib were established. The molecular proﬁles and cellular phenotypes of these resistant sublines were characterized. Although previously reported, alterations including
secondary EGFR T790M mutation, MET ampliﬁcation, and appearance of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) features were observed, these 2 drug-exposure methods revealed different resistance
mechanisms. The resistant cells with EMT features exhibited downregulation of miRNA-200c by
DNA methylation. Furthermore, the HCC827-derived subline characterized by the high-concentration
exposure method exhibited not only EMT features but also stem cell–like properties, including aldehyde
dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1A1) overexpression, increase of side-population, and self-renewal capability. Resistant sublines with stem cell–like properties were resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic
agents but equally sensitive to histone deacetylase and proteasome inhibitors, compared with their parental
cells. ALDH1A1 was upregulated in clinical samples with acquired resistance to geﬁtinib. In conclusion,
our study indicates that the manner of EGFR-TKI exposure inﬂuences the mechanism of acquired
resistance and the appearance of stem cell–like property with EGFR-TKI treatment. Cancer Res; 73(10);

Introduction
EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations are oncogenic alterations
in non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC; refs. 1, 2). Firstgeneration EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as
geﬁtinib and erlotinib, have exhibited signiﬁcant antiproliferative effects against NSCLC with EGFR mutations in
preclinical studies (1, 2) and have also resulted in prolonged
disease-free survival in randomized phase III studies (3–5).

However, patients with EGFR-activating mutations who
initially respond to EGFR-TKIs eventually acquire resistance,
which is a critical problem in the treatment of patients with
advanced NSCLC. Several mechanisms are believed to be
responsible for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, including
secondary EGFR T790M and minor mutations, MET ampliﬁcation, and activation of MET/HGF axis, acquiring an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature, and
transformation from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer
(SCLC; refs. 6–11). More recently, AXL kinase activation and
loss of the EGFR-mutant allele have been reported as possible mechanisms of resistance, but it is likely that additional
mechanisms remain to be identiﬁed (12, 13).
Establishment of resistant sublines is a common experimental method to investigate the mechanism of drug
resistance. The properties of resistant cells can vary according to the experimental methods used in the developing
process. For example, in endometrial cancer, cisplatin-resistant cells established by stepwise escalation exposure and
high-concentration exposure methods showed different cellular properties that may be either a cause or result of drug
resistance (14). This fact suggests that the mechanism of
EGFR-TKI resistance may vary according to in vitro culture

conditions, resulting in ﬁnding of novel features of resistant
cells. Although the majority of previously reported cells that
were resistant to EGFR-TKI were established with stepwise
escalation of EGFR-TKI concentration, we successfully
established resistant cells with the high-concentration exposure method as well as the stepwise escalation method, and
identiﬁed novel features of cells resistant to EGFR-TKI. The
purposes of this study were to investigate the acquired
mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKI and to explore strategies to overcome resistance to EGFR-TKI.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
EGFR-mutant HCC827 (exon19del E746–A750), PC-9
(exon19del E746–A750), HCC4006 (exon19del L747–E749), and
HCC4011 (L858R) cells were used. These cell lines except for
PC-9 were established by one of the authors (A.F. Gazdar). PC-9
was obtained from Immuno-Biological Laboratories. All the
cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented
with 10% FBS, and grown in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5%
CO2 at 37 C. EGFR-TKI–resistant sublines were established by
2 different methods: parental cells were cultured with stepwise
escalation of concentrations of geﬁtinib from 5 nmol/L to 2
mmol/L over 6 months (stepwise escalation method), or initially high concentration of geﬁtinib (2 mmol/L) over 6 months
(high-concentration method). Finally, geﬁtinib-resistant sublines named as HCC827-GR-step, PC-9-GR-step, HCC4006-GRstep, and HCC4011-GR-step were established by stepwise
escalation method, and HCC827-GR-high1, HCC827-GR-high2,
PC-9-GR-high, HCC4006-GR-high, and HCC4011-GR-high were
established by high-concentration method. About HCC827GR-high1 and high2, these 2 sublines were independently
established from different cultures with high-concentration
method. The identities of all the parental and resistant cells
were conﬁrmed by analyzing the short tandem repeat proﬁle
using the Cell ID System (Promega) and ABI Prism 310 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clonal-resistant cells were isolated by
limiting dilution.
Details about the reagents used in the cell proliferation assay
and the antibodies for Western blot analysis, ﬂuorescence immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry are included in the Supplementary Methods.
Determination of cell proliferation
Cell proliferation was determined by a modiﬁed MTS assay
with CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega) as
previously reported (15). The antiproliferative effects are
shown as IC50, which is the concentration of the drug required
to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%.
Western blot analysis
The detailed protocol for the Western blotting has been
described previously (15). Monoclonal antiactin antibody, used
as an equal loading control, was purchased from Merch KGaA.
The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect speciﬁc

signals, the membranes were examined using ECL Prime
Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare).
Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array and phosphokinase arrays
A Human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) Array
Kit and a Human Phospho-Kinase Array Kit (R&D Systems)
were used to measure the relative level of tyrosine phosphorylation of 42 distinct RTKs and the relative level of phosphorylation of 46 distinct intracellular kinases. Both arrays were
conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Fluorescence immunocytochemistry
The cells were cultured and ﬁxed by 4% formaldehyde on
chamber slides. Primary antibodies against EGFR, E-cadherin,
vimentin, aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1A1), and
ABCB1 were used. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
DNA and RNA extraction
Genomic DNAs were isolated from cell lines, frozen tumors,
or parafﬁn-embedded tumor by using DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen), standard phenol–chloroform (1:1) extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, or QIAmp DNA FFPE
Tissue Kit (Qiagen), respectively. Total RNAs were extracted
from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA
was synthesized from total RNA using High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Direct sequencing, PCR-based length polymorphism
assay, and subcloning
We determined the mutational status of EGFR, KRAS,
NRAS, and BRAF genes by direct sequencing, and PCR
conditions are provided in Supplementary Table S1A. EGFR
exon 19 deletion was also detected with PCR-based length
polymorphism assay, which have previously reported (16).
For subcloning, PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO vector using TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). One
hundred clones were randomly selected for PCR-based
length polymorphism assay.
Analyses of copy number by qPCR and FISH assays
Copy number gains (CNG) of EGFR and MET genes were
determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay
using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), as previously reported (17, 18). Primer sequences are
provided in Supplementary Table S1B. In brief, gene dosage
of each target and LINE-1 gene, a reference gene, was
calculated using the standard curve method. Relative copy
number of each sample was determined by comparing the
ratio of target gene to LINE-1 in each sample with the ratio of
these genes in human genomic DNA (EMD Biosciences). On
the basis of our previous study, we deﬁned high-level ampliﬁcation as values greater than 4 in cell lines and those
greater than 5 in clinical samples (17, 18).
A dual-color FISH assay was conducted using the LSI
EGFR SpectrumOrange/CEP7 SpectrumGreen probe (Vysis)

according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty metaphase spreads and 200 interphase nuclei were analyzed in
each slide.
Hybridoma production and TKI sensitivity analysis
The parental HCC827 cells were fused with HCC827-GRhigh2 using Sendai virus (hemagglutinating virus of Japan)
envelope (HVJ-E) GenomONE-CF (Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha
Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief,
HCC827 cells stained with PKH26 Red ﬂuorescent Cell Linker
Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 HCC827-GRhigh2 cells stained with PKH67 Green ﬂuorescent Cell Linker
Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The fused cells were conﬁrmed as doubleﬂuorescent positive cells in ﬂuorescent microscopy. Cells were
treated with 2 mmol/L of geﬁtinib and the presence of doubleﬂuorescent positive and single-ﬂuorescent positive cells
(HCC827 and HCC827-GR-high2) was examined 14 days after.
Expression proﬁling analysis
RNA from cells was proﬁled on Illumina HumanHT-12 V4
Expression BeadChip arrays according to the Illumina protocol. The array measures expression levels for more than
47,000 transcripts derived from the NCBI RefSeq Release 38.
BRB array tools (version 4.2) were used to conduct robust
spline normalization on background corrected data to generate log2-transformed normalized data. Fold change in
expression for individual probes was calculated and probes
with fold changes exceeding 2-fold or below 2-fold were
considered over- and underexpressed, respectively (Supplementary Table S2).
mRNA and miRNA expression analysis by qRT-PCR
mRNA expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on cDNA using TaqMan
probes and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). In miRNA expression analysis, the miRNA was
isolated with TaqMan MicroRNA Cells-to-CT Kit (Ambion),
and reverse transcription was conducted with TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcriptional Kit systems (Applied Biosystems)
using TaqMan primers for each miRNA. Primer and probe sets
(Supplementary Table S1C and S1D) were purchased from
Applied Biosystems and used according to manufacturer's
instructions. PCR ampliﬁcation was conducted on an ABI
StepOne Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems) and
gene expression was calculated using the comparative CT
method. Three replicates per sample were assayed for each
gene. To quantify the relative changes in gene expression, the 2
(DDCT) method was used and reactions were normalized to
endogenous control gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression levels in mRNA expression
analysis, and miR-374 expression level in miRNA expression
analysis, respectively.
DNA methylation analysis
DNA was subjected to bisulfate treatment using Epitect
Bisulﬁte Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA methylation status was examined by bisulﬁte genomic sequencing and methylation-speciﬁc PCR (MSP) as pre-

viously reported (19). Primers are listed in Supplementary
Table S1E and S1F.
Sphere formation assays in serum-free cultures
A total of 5  103 of cells were plated in 24-well plates with
Ultra-Low Attachment surface (Corning Inc.), and cultured in
serum-free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 ng/mL EGF and 10 ng/mL basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF; all from Sigma-Aldrich). The
numbers of spheres exceeding 150 mm in size for each well were
counted by microscope after 14 days of culturing.
Side-population analysis
The basic protocol for side-population analysis was based
on Goodell and colleagues (20). Cells were resuspended at
1  106/mL in prewarmed RPMI-1640, and Hoechst 33342
dye (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of
5 mg/mL in the presence or absence of verapamil (30 mg/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then incubated at 37 C for 75
minutes with intermittent shaking. Propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells, to a ﬁnal concentration
of 1 mg/mL, to gate the viable cells. The cell preparations
were ﬁltered through a 40-mm cell strainer to obtain single
cell suspension. The cell samples were then analyzed on a
BD FACSVantage SE (BD Biosciences) cell sorter. The side
population was identiﬁed as a group of cells that did not take
up the Hoechst dye, a characteristic abolished with verapamil treatment (20). These analyses were conducted at
ReproCELL.
Tumor cell implantation experiments
HCC827, HCC827-GR-high1, and HCC827-GR-high2 cells
were subcutaneously injected into the nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice purchased from Charles River. Groups of mice were inoculated
with each cell line at 5  106. Tumor growth was monitored
and individual tumor volumes were measured using a digital
caliper and approximated according to the formula V ¼ 1/2ab2
(a, the long diameter and b, the short diameter of the tumor).
At the end of experiments, mice were sacriﬁced after 4 weeks
and tumors were harvested, measured, photographed, and
pathologically examined.
Immunothistochemical anaylses of clinical samples
Tumor samples were obtained at Okayama University Hospital (Okayama, Japan) with patients' consent under Institutional Review Board–approved protocols. Biopsied samples
after acquisition of EGFR-TKI resistance were ﬁxed in 10%
formaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with ALDH1A1 (diluted 1:400 in PBS),
ABCB1 (1:200), E-cadherin (1:1,000), and vimentin (1:200) was
conducted. The detailed protocol for the IHC staining has been
described previously (21).
Statistical analyses
All data were analyzed using JMP v 9.0.0 software (SAS
Institute Inc.). P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All tests
were two-sided.

Results
Genotypic mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs
Four cell lines (HCC827, PC-9, HCC4006, and HCC4011)
with TKI-sensitive EGFR mutations were exposed to geﬁtinib
by 2 different methods: stepwise escalation (GR-step series)
and high-concentration exposure (GR-high series). From
these efforts, 9 sublines resistant to geﬁtinib were established: HCC827-GR-step, PC-9-GR-step, HCC4006-GR-step,
HCC4011-GR-step, HCC827-GR-high1, HCC827-GR-high2,
PC-9-GR-high, HCC4006-GR-high, and HCC4011-GR-high.
The IC50 values against geﬁtinib and erlotinib of these 9
resistant sublines exceeded 5 mmol/L (Table 1). The expressions of EGFR and its effector proteins in these cell lines
were proﬁled (Supplementary Fig. S1A). To explore the
genotypic changes following acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs, we examined the genomic DNA of both parental and
resistant cells. In sublines established with the stepwise
escalation method, qPCR revealed that HCC827-GR-step and
HCC4011-GR-step exhibited MET ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S1B), whereas PC-9-GR-step showed the presence of
EGFR T790M mutation detected by direct sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Among sublines established with the
high-concentration method, only HCC4011-GR-high showed
MET ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Fig S1B). These resistance mechanisms were consistent with the results of previous studies (22–24). Neither T790M nor MET ampliﬁcation
was observed in any of the other 5 sublines (HCC4006-GRstep, HCC827-GR-high1, HCC827-GR-high2, PC-9-GR-high,
and HCC4006-GR-high). No resistant sublines harbored secondary mutations in the KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF gene.
After acquiring resistance to EGFR-TKIs, all sublines
except HCC827-GR-high2 retained EGFR mutations, CNG, and
protein expression, as determined by direct sequencing, qPCR,
and Western blotting, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Originally, parental HCC827 cells showed focal ampliﬁcation of
EGFR with 32.3 copies estimated by FISH and qPCR assays. In
HCC827-GR-high2, qPCR, PCR-based length polymorphism
and FISH assays revealed progressive decrease in the EGFRmutant allele through the course of passages leading to the
disappearance of focally ampliﬁed EGFR alleles (Fig. 1). Subcloning of the PCR product from HCC827-GR-high2 produced
100 of 100 clones exhibiting wild-type EGFR instead of the exon
19 deletion, as determined by PCR-based length polymorphism
assay. In addition, 3 sublines from independent single cells
were established from HCC827-GR-high2. No mutant alleles
were detected in 2 of these sublines, whereas a small population of mutant alleles was identiﬁed in the third subline as
determined by direct sequencing. These data indicate that the
focal ampliﬁcation of the EGFR gene, which was considered a
mutant allele, disappeared in HCC827-GR-high2.
Phenotypic change in acquiring resistance
Microscopically, each of the 4 sublines, HCC827-GR-high1,
HCC827-GR-high2, HCC4006-GR-high, and HCC4006-GR-step,
exhibited a spindle cell–like morphology that was different
from their parental cell lines. As expected, these 4 sublines
displayed EMT features in Western blotting and ﬂuorescence
immunocytochemistry for E-cadherin and vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). In contrast, PC-9 and HCC4011 cells
and the derived resistant sublines did not show EMT features.
Expression proﬁle of mRNA and kinases in HCC827 cells
Because we had a great interest in HCC827-GR-high2 whose
ampliﬁed EGFR-mutant alleles disappeared, we examined the
mRNA expression proﬁle in HCC827-GR-high2 by using cDNA
microarray. Details of this expression proﬁle are presented in
Supplementary Table S2. We identiﬁed upregulation of many
genes, and particularly noticed upregulation in the expression
of genes encoding ALDH1A1 and ABC transporters, which were

Expression status of miR-200 family in resistant cell lines
with EMT features
The result of cDNA microarray in HCC827-GR-high2 indicated the upregulation of Zinc-ﬁnger enhancer binding (ZEB)
transcription factors (ZEB1 and ZEB2), which are crucial EMT
activators (25–27). Because EMT was reported to be regulated
by miR-200 family targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2, we analyzed the
expression status of the miR-200 family by qRT-PCR. As shown
in Fig. 3A, miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c were downregulated in both HCC827- and HCC4006-derived resistant
sublines with EMT features. In particular, miR-200c was extensively downregulated in HCC827-GR-highs compared with
parental HCC827. To investigate the mechanism of downregulation of miR-200 family, we examined the methylation
status of miR-200 family by MSP (Fig. 3B) and bisulﬁte genomic
sequencing (data not shown). Our results indicate that miR200 families were methylated and their expressions were
recovered following treatment with 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine
(Fig. 3C).

ﬂow cytometry. We found an extreme increase in the number
of side-population cells in HCC827-GR-highs as illustrated
in Fig. 4A. The majority of the side-population fraction in
HCC827-GR-highs was eliminated in the presence of verapamil, indicating the speciﬁcity of the side population. In addition, we conducted a sphere formation assay to examine the
cellular functional features of stem cell–like properties. We
found that HCC827-GR-highs acquired higher ability to form
spheres in suspension culture compared with parental HCC827
and HCC827-GR-step (Fig. 4B). To examine the stem cell–like
properties in vivo, we conducted tumor transplantation experiments (28, 29). We subcutaneously implanted HCC827,
HCC827-GR-high1, and HCC827-GR-high2 cells to examine
the tumor-forming capability in NOD/SCID mice. We found
that HCC827-GR-highs exhibited higher tumorigenicity than
parental HCC827 cells did. The HCC827-GR-highs established
larger tumors with shorter latencies than the parental HCC827
cells did (Fig. 4C). HCC827-GR-highs showed a signiﬁcant
increase in the expression of ALDH1A1, as indicated by IHC
staining (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results further indicate
that HCC827-GR-highs acquired stem cell–like properties. Of
interest, the histologic ﬁnding of HCC827-GR-highs was different from that of parental HCC827 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Even after culturing of HCC827-GR-highs with geﬁtinib-free
medium for 6 months, HCC827-GR-high2 still exhibited both
the EMT and stem cell–like features, and did not exhibit
production of EGFR-mutant–speciﬁc protein or further
increase of either mutant allele or EGFR copy number (Supplementary Fig. S5). The appearance of stem cell–like properties in HCC827-resistant sublines established by high-concentration method was independently conﬁrmed in 3 additional
different culture dishes.

Stem cell–like property in acquiring resistance
Upregulation of ALDH1A1 and ABC transporters suggests
that HCC827-GR-highs may acquire stem cell–like properties.
Thus, we quantiﬁed the side population by dual wavelength

Geﬁtinib sensitivity of HCC827 and HCC827-GR-high2

A hybridoma model was generated with parental and

upregulation of stem cell-related markers such as ALDH1A1,
ABC transporters, and CD44 was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2).
In addition, the upregulation of ALDH1A1 in HCC827-GR-highs
was conﬁrmed by Western blotting and ﬂuorescent immunocytochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). ALDH1A1
was not detected in the other sublines.
We conducted phospho-RTK array and phospho-kinase
array to ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences including AXL between
parental HCC827 and HCC827-GR-highs, except for the downregulation of phosphorylated EGFR protein in HCC827-GRhighs (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Figure 2. Relative gene expression levels of stem cell–related markers by qRT-PCR. The mRNA expressions of ALDH1A1, ABCB1, ABCG2, and CD44
were conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR. The expression of stem cell–related markers ALDH1A1, ABCG2, and CD44 were higher than that of the parental line in
HCC827-GR-highs. In addition, the expression of ABCB1 was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the parental line in HCC827-GR-step, HCC827-GR-highs,
PC-9-GR-high, and HCC4006-GR-high.

EGFR-TKI resistance in HCC827-GR-high2 that exhibited loss
of mutant EGFR alleles, EMT, and stem cell–like properties
involved either loss- or gain-of-function. A hybridoma cell line
was generated by fusing HCC827 with HCC827-GR-high2,
which was then treated with geﬁtinib. The hybridoma exhibited resistance to geﬁtinib at a concentration of 2 mmol/L,
indicating that the resistant cells had acquired drug-resistant
properties to parental cells, rather than having lost drug
sensitivity.
Sensitivity to various drugs in each cell line
Drug sensitivities against various agents are shown
in Table 2. The sublines of HCC827, PC-9, and HCC4006
generated under high concentrations of geﬁtinib exhibited
higher IC50 values for docetaxel and paclitaxel than those of

parental cells. Moreover, we examined the antitumor effects
of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors [trichostatin A and
vorinostat (SAHA)] and a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib). These inhibitors produced moderate to strong antitumor effects in both parental and resistant cells, which did
not acquire resistance to these drugs (Table 2; refs. 30, 31).
Molecular proﬁle of EGFR-TKI–resistant clinical
samples
Clinical tumor samples, which showed acquired resistance
to TKIs, were collected both before and after TKI treatment
and examined genetically and immunohistologically (Table 3).
Among 16 cases with acquired resistance to TKIs, corresponding pretreatment samples were available in 3 cases (no. 1, 5, and
16). After acquiring resistance, 3 cases exhibited EGFR T790M

samples harboring EMT features (based on E-cadherin and
vimentin expression status) also exhibited expression of stem
cell–related markers ALDH1A1 and ABCB1, determined by
IHC staining (Fig. 4D). In total, 5 of 16 cases exhibited
ALDH1A1 expression in samples that showed acquired resistance to TKI. In 3 cases whose pretreatment samples were
available, ALDH1A1 was not expressed prior to TKI treatment.
Among them, 2 cases (no. 5 and 16) exhibited ALDH1A1
expression after acquiring resistance to TKI. Of note, case no.

other anticancer drugs except geﬁtinib and erlotinib were

Discussion
In this study, we showed that the method of drug exposure in
cell culture inﬂuences the mechanisms of acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKI. Studies using EGFR-mutant cell lines have
indicated that the different types of resistance mechanisms
are determined within the individual cell lines in response to
certain conditions. For instance, both PC-9 and H3255 are
known to develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs through EGFR
T790M mutation as a result of stepwise escalation exposure
(22, 23). On the other hand, HCC827 is known to overcome
EGFR-TKI through MET ampliﬁcation (8, 32). Interestingly,
Suda and colleagues reported that HCC827 cells developed the
T790M mutation under the inhibition of MET signaling, sug-

gesting that the microenvironment of the tumor cells inﬂuenced the mechanisms of resistance (32). Indeed, in an analysis
using multiple geﬁtinib refractory tumors obtained from
autopsies, the lesions from patients exhibited T790M and/or
MET ampliﬁcation depending on the lesion sites (32). In
addition to these resistance mechanisms accompanying
somatic gene alterations, recent studies have indicated that
some biologic signatures such as acquisition of EMT phenotype and transformation to SCLC were associated with EGFRTKI resistance, the causative genetic alterations of which are
not known (11, 33, 34). EMT was observed in HCC4006 sublines
and HCC827-GR-highs, but not in HCC827-GR-step sublines.
Summarily, these observations suggest that cancer cells might
be able to enact different mechanisms based on the microenvironment to survive and escape cell death from apoptotic
pressure of EGFR-TKI.
Among identiﬁed EMT-related genes, ZEB1 expression was
reported to be most signiﬁcantly correlated with mesenchymal
phenotype in human malignancies including NSCLC (25, 26).
The cDNA array revealed upregulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression in HCC827-GR-high2 and we consequently focused
on the miR-200 family, which is reported to repress ZEB1 as a
key regulator of EMT (35). Indeed, our results indicate downregulated expression of the miR-200 family, especially miR200c, in resistant sublines with EMT features. Moreover, a
recent study has indicated that loss of miR-200c expression
with DNA methylation is associated with chemoresistant

Figure 4. Emergence of the stem cell–like properties in acquiring resistance to EGFR-TKI cells. A, side population analysis shows the extreme increase of sidepopulation cells in HCC827-GR-highs compared with parental cells. The majority of the side-population fraction in HCC827-GR-highs was eliminated
in the presence of verapamil. B, by sphere formation assay, HCC827-GR-highs acquired high ability to form spheres in suspension culture. C, the
HCC827-GR-highs established larger tumors with shorter latencies than the parental HCC827 cells did in NOD/SCID mice, indicating HCC827-GR-highs
exhibited higher tumorigenicity than parental HCC827 cells. D, representative images of IHC staining of pretreatment and recurrent tumor after

phenotype in NSCLC (36). Of note, it is now known that EMT
activators not only activate cellular motility but are also
associated with the maintenance of stem cell properties and
cell survival (37, 38). Our ﬁndings present the novel insight that
the repression of miR-200 family by DNA methylation is
responsible for EMT during the acquisition of resistance to
EGFR-TKI.
As an important ﬁnding, some resistant cells with EMT
signatures exhibited stem cell–like properties. Cancer stem
cells (CSC), which are characterized by the capacity for pluripotency and self-renewal, have been attracting interest as a
source of cancer cells (39). The signiﬁcance of stem cell–like
properties in lung cancer has been investigated in both basic
and clinical research (40, 41). However, the CSC of lung cancers
remains a subject of ongoing research, and its speciﬁc makers
have not yet been identiﬁed. In our study, several cell surface
proteins, including CD133, that may be candidate markers of
general CSC, were not upregulated in resistant sublines. These
results collectively suggest that understanding and overcom-

ing drug resistance from the viewpoint of stem cell identity
may present new and challenging opportunities.
We examined the sensitivity of various types of drugs,
including conventional chemotherapeutic agents, HDAC inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitor, to resistant sublines.
HCC827-GR-highs, HCC4006-GR-high, and PC-9-GR-high
exhibited signiﬁcant resistance to docetaxel and paclitaxel,
but not to cisplatin. This result is reasonable because docetaxel
and paclitaxel, unlike cisplatin, are considered to be efﬂuxed by
the ABC transporter system, which was upregulated in these
sublines. These results would lead to selection of appropriate
chemotherapeutic drugs following acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKI.
In our study, clinically usable HDAC inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor SAHA and bortezomib exhibited similar antitumor efﬁcacy for both parental and resistant cells. Clinical
studies have shown that SAHA is effective for NSCLC when
combined with other cancer therapies (42, 43). Notably, HDAC
inhibitors are reported to be effective in treating chronic

myelogenous leukemia, in which stem cells appeared after the
acquisition of resistance to imatinib mesylate (44). The proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib failed to produce antitumor effects
either alone or in conjunction with other drugs in a clinical
trial, although preliminary data suggested that bortezomib as a
single agent may show antitumor activity in patients with
NSCLC (45, 46). However, current research is rapidly working
toward the development of next-generation proteasome inhi-

bitors (47), and our data indicating that bortezomib activity
was not inﬂuenced by the EGFR-TKI resistance state may be
useful for the future development of proteasome inhibitors.
Our results support the usefulness of in vitro experiment to
investigate the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-TKI. In the
pharmacokinetic analysis of geﬁtinib, the plasma concentration of geﬁtinib was found to reach a steady-state level within 7
days, in most of the cases (48). Nakamura and colleagues

reported that the plasma concentration of geﬁtinib in patients
receiving 250 mg geﬁtinib daily ranged from 115 to 2,012 ng/mL
(0.257–4.502 mmol/L) on day 3 (D3) and 126 to 2,926 ng/mL
(0.282–6.547 mmol/L) on day 8 (D8), whereas the median D8-toD3 ratio was 1.578 and ranged from 0.758 to 6.094 (49). These
results indicate considerable variation in plasma concentration and the pharmacokinetics of geﬁtinib according to individual patients. Of note, D8-to-D3 ratio under 1.0 indicates that
drug concentration may reach a plateau shortly after initiation
of geﬁtinib treatment. This condition may be similar to that of
drug contact to cells in our high-concentration method. In
addition, Haura and colleagues reported that tumor levels
during treatment with geﬁtinib were higher than, but not
related to, plasma levels (50). Further resistance-related
research will require additional elaboration about culture
conditions and microenvironment.
It is still not known what caused the emergence of stem
cell–like properties in HCC827-GR-highs; however, 2 possibilities should be considered: (i) high-concentration exposure induces cells with stem cell–like properties; and (ii) the
cells with stem cell–like properties existed as minor clones
in HCC827 prior to geﬁtinib exposure, and these were ﬁnally
selected as the major clones. For the latter possibility, it is
also not clear as to why cells with stem–like properties
appeared as the major population only from the high-concentration exposure method.
In conclusion, culture conditions with EGFR-TKI seem to
inﬂuence the mechanism of acquired resistance, suggesting

that the microenvironment is a determinating factor for the
mechanisms underlying acquisition of resistance to EGFRTKI. Our study indicated that EGFR-TKI treatment induced
stem cell–like properties and is associated with EGFR-TKI
resistance.
