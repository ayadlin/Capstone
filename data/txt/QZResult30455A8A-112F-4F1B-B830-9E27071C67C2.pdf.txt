Abstract
Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a potent sphingolipid mediator
of diverse processes important for brain tumors, including
cell growth, survival, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis.
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), one of the two isoenzymes
that produce sphingosine-1-phosphate, is up-regulated in
glioblastoma and has been linked to poor prognosis in
patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In the present
study, we found that a potent isotype-specific SphK1 inhibitor,
SK1-I, suppressed growth of LN229 and U373 glioblastoma
cell lines and nonestablished human GBM6 cells. SK1-I also
enhanced GBM cell death and inhibited their migration
and invasion. SK1-I rapidly reduced phosphorylation of
Akt but had no significant effect on activation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2, another important survival
pathway for GBM. Inhibition of the concomitant activation
of the c-Jun-NH2-kinase pathway induced by SK1-I attenuated
death of GBM cells. Importantly, SK1-I markedly reduced the
tumor growth rate of glioblastoma xenografts, inducing
apoptosis and reducing tumor vascularization, and enhanced
the survival of mice harboring LN229 intracranial tumors. Our
results support the notion that SphK1 may be an important
factor in GBM and suggest that an isozyme-specific inhibitor
of SphK1 deserves consideration as a new therapeutic agent
for this disease. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6915–23]

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal
type of primary central nervous system tumors with a median
survival of 10 to 12 months, even after aggressive surgery, radiation,
and advanced chemotherapy (1). Poor prognosis of patients with
GBM has recently been correlated with elevated expression of
sphingosine kinase type 1 (SphK1; refs. 2, 3), one of the SphK
isoenzymes that generates the pleiotropic lipid mediator, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P has been implicated in the etiology of
GBM due to its involvement in various cell processes particularly
important for tumorgenicity, including growth, survival, invasion,
angiogenesis, and metastasis (4–7). The biological effects of this

serum-borne lipid are mainly mediated by a family of five specific G
protein–coupled receptors, designated S1P1-5 (8). Of those, S1P1-3,
are expressed in the majority of human glioblastoma cell lines and
are involved in S1P-mediated proliferation (4). Although S1P has no
effect on matrix metalloproteinase secretion, it enhances glioblastoma cell adhesion and also stimulates their motility and
invasiveness (9). Because S1P is present at high levels in brain
tissue, it is possible that autocrine or paracrine signaling by S1P
through its receptors enhances both glioma cell proliferation and
invasiveness (10).
To explore the therapeutic implications of targeting SphK1 for
treatment of GBM, we examined the effects of a newly developed
isozyme-specific inhibitor of SphK1, SK1-I (11), and found that it
inhibits growth of GBM in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that
specific SphK1 inhibitors might be useful for treatment, either
alone or in combination with advanced chemotherapeutic agents.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. U373-MG and LN229 human glioblastoma cells (American Type
Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. Primary
human nonestablished glioblastoma GBM6 cells were kindly provided by
Dr. C. David James (University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA)
and were passaged as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and subcultured for
1 wk following isolation from tumors in media containing 2% FCS to prevent
growth of contaminating rodent fibroblasts and then cultured in 5% FCS as
described (12). LN229 cells were transfected with H2B-EGFP plasmid and
stable colonies were isolated following selection with 1 mg/mL of G418.
LN229-H2B-EGFP cells were passaged as tumors as described above.
Xenograft tumors. Adult male National Cancer Institute (NCI) nu/nu
mice were purchased from NCI. All animal studies were conducted in the
Animal Research Core Facility at Virginia Commonwealth University School
of Medicine in accordance with the institutional guidelines. LN229 cells
(1  106) were injected in the flanks ( four sites per mouse). Palpable tumors
appeared in f1 wk. Five days later, when tumors reached 3 to 4 mm in
diameter, mice were randomly separated into two groups and injected i.p.
with saline or SK1-I (10 mg/kg) every other day. Tumor measurements were
made with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula:
[k  (length in millimeters)  (width in millimeters)2]/6. At the end of the
experiment, the animals were euthanized and the tumors removed, fixed in
formalin and embedded in paraffin, or frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Intracranial LN229 xenograft tumors. Adult female NCI nu/nu mice
were anesthetized and LN229-H2B-EGFP cells (2.5  104 in 1 AL PBS) were
stereotactically implanted in the putamen region (1 mm anterior and
2.5 mm lateral to the Bregma at the depth of 3.5 mm at a rate of
0.1 AL/min). Mice were monitored for recovery until complete wakening.
Twenty days after implantation, mice were injected i.p. with SK1-I
(20 mg/kg in PBS) every other day. Mice were observed daily following
tumor implantation and were euthanized on reaching a moribund state.

In vitro assays. Immunoblotting, cell proliferation and cell death assays
(13), SphK1 activity (11), and colony formation assays (14) were carried out
following standard protocols as detailed previously.

Results
SK1-I potently inhibits growth and survival of human
glioblastoma cells. Previous studies showed that S1P and SphK1,
the kinase that produces it, play critical roles in growth and
survival of glioblastoma cells (2, 4, 6). In agreement, downregulation of SphK1 expression decreased growth of both U373
cells, which express mutated PTEN, and LN229 cells expressing
wild-type PTEN, in serum-free medium as well as in the presence of
serum, which greatly enhanced their growth (Fig. 1A). Expression
of SphK1 in these cells was drastically reduced by siRNA targeted to
a specific sequence of SphK1 mRNA, as detected by Western
blotting with a polyclonal anti-SphK1 antibody (Fig. 1A). The
greater sensitivity of U373 cells to down-regulation of SphK1 might
be due to much lower SphK1 expression and enzymatic activity
compared with LN229 cells (Fig. 1B).
We recently described the first SphK1-specific inhibitor, SK1-I
(11). SK1-I inhibited growth of both U373 and LN229 cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). A significant inhibitory effect
was observed at 3 Amol/L. SK1-I at 10 Amol/L strongly inhibited
growth of U373 and LN229 cells cultured in the absence of serum
(Fig. 1C). SK1-I was less effective when cells were cultured in the
presence of serum, which contains multiple growth factors and
S1P. However, even in the presence of serum, within 2 to 4 days,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

there were severe reductions in cell numbers after treatment with
10 Amol/L SK1-I (Fig. 1C).
SK1-I inhibits migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells.
As S1P and SphK1 have been shown to regulate migration and
invasion of glioblastoma cells (5, 7, 9, 15), and SphK1 regulates
actin cytoskeletal dynamics (16) and lamellipodia formation (17),
it was of interest to examine whether inhibition of SphK1 by
SK1-I correlated with changes in reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton. Filamentous-actin (F-actin) was distributed across
unstimulated U373 cells, as revealed by staining with Alexa 488–
conjugated phalloidin (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In response to
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate the actin cytoskeleton underwent
dramatic reorganization, and more F-actin was condensed at the
leading edge within lamellipodia (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In
agreement with a previous study with human macrophages (16),
down-regulation of SphK1 markedly reduced the number of actinrich lamellipodia produced by treatment with PMA (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Similarly, inhibiting SphK1 with SK1-I
dramatically reduced PMA-stimulated F-actin reorganization at the
leading edge as well as formation of lamellipodia and induced
disassembly of filopodia (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D).
These results support the notion that SphK1 activity is required
for actin filament dynamics (16). Therefore, we next examined the
effect of SK1-I on migration and invasion of glioma cells. Directed
motility (chemotaxis) of U373 cells toward serum or epidermal
growth factor (EGF) in Boyden chamber assays was reduced by
SK1-I (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similarly, chemotaxis of LN229
cells, which show much greater rates of basal and stimulated
migration toward serum and EGF than U373 cells, is also

significantly inhibited by SK1-I (Fig. 2A). SK1-I also drastically
inhibited chemotaxis of LN229 cells toward lysophosphatidic acid
(LPA), another serum-borne lysophospholipid that has been shown
to be a potent chemoattractant for certain glioblastoma cell lines,
including LN229 cells (Fig. 2A; ref. 15). LPA, serum, and EGF also
stimulated in vitro invasion of LN229 cells (Fig. 2B), determined by
their ability to invade the basement membrane matrix Matrigel,
which was also greatly attenuated by SK1-I (Fig. 2B).
SK1-I reduces basal and stimulated Akt phosphorylation.
S1P-induced glioblastoma cell proliferation is greatly suppressed by
inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and

phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways (4). Thus, it was of
interest to examine the effects of SK1-I on these signaling
pathways. We used phospho-specific antibodies to examine
phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 in the activation loop and at
Ser473 at the COOH terminus, which are required for full activation
(18). Consistent with the expression of wild-type PTEN, LN229 cells
have low basal Akt phosphorylation, which was rapidly increased
by serum, LPA, and EGF, to a lesser extent (Fig. 2C). SK1-I reduced
Akt activation induced by all three stimuli. Treatment with SK1-I
for only 20 minutes markedly suppressed phosphorylation of Akt at
both Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 2C). SK1-I also reduced activation of

amounts of proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti–phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti–phospho-c-Jun (Ser63/73), anti–ATF-2 (Thr71), or anti-CHC
antibodies. C, LN229 cells were cultured for 24 h with vehicle or 10 Amol/L SK1-I in the absence or presence of 1 Amol/L SB202190, 1 Amol/L SP600125,
1 Amol/L U0126, or 10 Amol/L LY294002, and cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. D, LN229 cells were infected with a control empty vector virus (CMV ) or
adenoviruses to express dominant-negative Akt (dnAkt ), constitutively active Akt (caAkt ), dnMEK1, caMEK1, or Bcl-xL. Cells were then treated with vehicle or
10 Amol/L SK1-I and cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion 48 h after drug exposure. Where indicated, cells were also treated with the JNK inhibitory peptide
(JNK-IP, 10 Amol/L) 30 min before addition of SK1-I.

p70S6K (Thr389), a downstream target of Akt. In sharp contrast,
although serum, LPA, and EGF stimulated ERK1/2 in these shortterm assays, SK1-I did not significantly affect stimulated ERK1/2
phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 (Fig. 2C). Moreover, although
Akt is active in U373 cells because, such as many human gliomas,
they express a nonfunctional mutant form of PTEN that does not
inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway (18), SK1-I reduced their basal Akt
phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). A
significant inhibitory effect was observed within 20 minutes
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), which lasted for at least 24 hours (data
not shown). As expected, serum and EGF enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas SK1-I reduced it (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
The inhibitory effect of SK1-I on Akt phosphorylation was not due
to its degradation as there were no significant reductions in total
Akt levels after treatment with SK1-I. However, SK1-I did not
reduce EGF- and serum-induced ERK1/2 activation in both U373
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) and LN229 cells (Fig. 2C).
To substantiate that the effects of SK1-I were due to its ability
to inhibit SphK1, S1P add-back experiments were carried out.
Inhibition of EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by SK1-I was
reversed by addition of S1P (Fig. 2D). EGF has been shown to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

activate PI3K/Akt by phosphorylating growth factor receptor–
bound protein 2–associated binder 1 (19). However, SK1-I did not
affect EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor
(EGFR) or growth factor receptor–bound protein 2–associated
binder 1 (Gab1; Fig. 2D), indicating that SK1-I did not directly
interfere with EGFR activation. Thus, the SphK1 inhibitor SK1-I
specifically inhibits phosphorylation and activation of Akt in GBM
cells in an S1P-dependent manner, consistent with the reduction in
levels of S1P by SK1-I (Fig. 3A).
Because down-regulation of SphK1 not only decreases S1P, it
also increases ceramide levels (20–23), it was of interest to examine
the effects of inhibition of SphK1 with SK1-I on these sphingolipid
metabolites that have been reported to have opposing effects on
cell growth and apoptosis (24, 25). There was a significant
reduction in S1P levels within 20 minutes after addition of SK1-I
(Fig. 3A), which correlated with the rapid inhibition of Akt
phosphorylation. Furthermore, within 1 hour after addition of
SK1-I, S1P levels were dramatically decreased by 70% that
was accompanied by an increase in sphingosine levels without
major changes in ceramide levels (Fig. 3A). However, after 24 hours
of treatment with SK1-I, ceramide levels increased markedly,

particularly proapoptotic C16-ceramide. Unlike safingol (L-threodihydrosphingosine; ref. 26), a pan SphK inhibitor, only <1% of
SK1-I was converted to the tri-N-methyl metabolite after 24 hours
(Fig. 3A) and no other metabolites were detected. Moreover, in
contrast to its structural analogue, the immunosuppressant drug
FTY720, SK1-I is not readily phosphorylated, ruling out potential
actions through S1P receptors.
Inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase attenuates SK1-I–
induced cell death. In agreement with many previous studies
showing that down-regulation of SphK1 and ceramide elevation are
associated with increased apoptosis (reviewed in refs. 25, 27, 28),
treatment with SK1-I induced apoptosis of LN229 cells as shown by
increased cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (Supplementary
Fig. S3A), a substrate for caspase-mediated proteolysis during
apoptosis, increased fragmented and condensed nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S3B), and increased DNA strand breaks detected by
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover,

SK1-I markedly suppressed long-term survival of LN229 cells in
clonogenic assays (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Sphingolipid metabolites, S1P versus sphingosine and ceramide,
usually have opposing effects on Akt and the stress-related c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (24, 25). Concomitant with
the inactivation of the cytoprotective Akt pathway, exposure of
LN229 cells to SK1-I was accompanied by delayed activation of JNK
(Fig. 3B), without affecting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(data not shown). Increased phosphorylation of JNK after addition
of SK1-I was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of its
substrates, the transcription factors c-Jun (Ser63/73) and ATF-2
(Thr71; Fig. 3B).
The output of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling versus JNK signaling
represents a key homeostatic mechanism that in many cells
regulates the balance between cell survival and cell death processes
(29). Thus, we next examined the effects of a variety of agents that
perturb these signaling pathways on SK1-I–mediated lethality.
Inhibition of MAP/ERK kinase 1/2, PI3K, and p38 by U0126,

LY294002, and SB202190, respectively, enhanced SK1-I lethality,
whereas inhibition of JNK by SP600125 markedly attenuated the
effects of SK1-I in both U373 and LN229 cells (data not shown;
Fig. 3C). As expected, SP600125 efficiently blocked JNK activation,
as shown by inhibition of c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B).
Even at 1 Amol/L, a concentration believed to specifically inhibit
JNK without having nonspecific effects on other kinases, SP600125
markedly reversed SK1-I–induced lethality (Fig. 3C). We further
examined the importance of the JNK pathway using a specific JNK
peptide inhibitor. This peptide also significantly reversed the
cytotoxic effects of SK1-I (Fig. 3D), whereas the control peptide
was ineffective. Similarly, expression of dominant-negative MEK1
also enhanced SK1-I–induced LN229 cell death, whereas dominantnegative Akt did not (Fig. 3D). Moreover, expression of constitutively
activated Akt or MEK1, or expression of Bcl-xL, suppressed cell death
induced by SK1-I (Fig. 3D).
Effect of SK1-I on primary nonestablished glioblastoma. We
expanded our observations with SK1-I to primary nonestablished
human GBM6 glioblastoma cells, which have been shown to
produce invasive, diffuse tumors in the brains of mice (14, 30).
GBM6 express mutant p53, wild-type PTEN, and EGFRvIII, a

constitutively activated mutant form of EGFR (14, 31). Similar to
LN229 and U373 cells, growth of GBM6 cells was greatly reduced
by SK1-I (Fig. 4A). In the absence of serum, there was a dosedependent effect of SK1-I and significant growth inhibition was
observed at a concentration as low as 1 Amol/L (Fig. 4A). Moreover, as with the glioblastoma cell lines, 10 Amol/L SK1-I
markedly reduced growth of GBM6 in the presence of serum
(Fig. 4B). SK1-I also suppressed serum- and EGF-induced invasion
of GBM6 (Fig. 4C). Similar to the effects on the established
glioblastoma cell lines, SK1-I reduced basal as well as serum- and
EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, without affecting pERK1/2
(Fig. 4D).
SK1-I reduces tumor growth in mice. Encouraged by our
findings, we investigated the effect of SK1-I on subcutaneous tumor
growth of LN229 cells, which are fairly invasive and grow
phenotypically similar to invasive gliomas in situ (32). Tumors
appeared as palpable masses about 1 week after s.c. injection of
one million cells in the flank of a mouse (Fig. 5A). Five days later,
when the tumor size could be reliably measured (3–4 mm in
diameter), animals were randomized and SK1-I was injected i.p.
every other day at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Tumors in control animals

showed significant increases in volume as early as day 27, and
growth accelerated thereafter. Statistical analysis (single factor
ANOVA) revealed significantly smaller tumors in the SK1-I
treatment group (Fig. 5A). After 43 days, animals had to be

sacrificed due to the tumor burden in control mice. Tumors were
excised, weighed, and histologically examined. In addition to the
tumor volume and size (Fig. 5A and B), SK1-I treatment reduced
tumor weight by almost 4-fold (Fig. 5C) and decreased vascularization in tumors, as shown by H&E staining (Fig. 5D). Similar
reductions in blood vessel density were observed by staining with
antibodies to the mouse-specific endothelial cell marker CD31
(Fig. 5D). In agreement, immunohistochemistry for vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also revealed elevated expression
of this angiogenic factor in vehicle-treated tumors that was greatly
reduced in SK1-I–treated mice (Fig. 5D). The disruption of tumor
cyto-architecture by SK1-I was accompanied by increased TUNELpositive apoptotic tumor cells (Fig. 5D). In agreement with
attenuation of Akt phosphorylation in GBM cells by SK1-I,
immunostaining for phosphorylated Akt in tumors was markedly
decreased by treatment with SK1-I (Fig. 5D).
SK1-I enhances survival of mice with LN229 orthotopic
tumors. It was of interest to examine whether SK1-I was effective
in a more clinically relevant orthotopic model of intracranially
implanted LN229 cells. On the basis of trial growth rate analyses,
i.p. treatment with SK1-I was initiated at day 20 after intracranial
implantation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–labeled LN229
cells when the tumors would be established and the mice would be
expected to be asymptomatic. Animals in the vehicle-treated group
began to show symptoms of tumor burden at day 40 and were
euthanized on reaching a moribund state between day 43 and
49 (Fig. 6A). None of the SK1-I–treated mice showed any symptoms
at this point and SK1-I administration was then halted (Fig. 6A).
At day 48, T2W magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence
of a large tumor in the right hemisphere of vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 6B), whereas no tumors were evident in SK1-I–treated
mice (Fig. 6B). Gadolinium enhancement revealed a small tumor in
the brain of this SK1-I–treated mouse at the site of the injection
(Fig. 6C). Moreover, visualization of GFP-labeled LN229 cells in
intracranial tumor sections showed significantly fewer invading
cells and noticeable areas of necrosis in the middle of the tumors
from SK1-I–treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals
(Fig. 6D). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of intracranial glioblastoma xenografts showed significant survival benefit from SK1-I
administration compared with vehicle control animals (Fig. 6A),
indicating that SK1-I was remarkably efficacious in the brain even
when administered i.p.

Discussion

Figure 6. SK1-I enhances survival of mice with LN229 cells implanted
intracranially. A to D, LN229-H2B-GFP cells were implanted into the brain
of nu/nu mice 1 mm anterior, 2.5 mm lateral to the Bregma and at a depth of
3.5 mm. Twenty days later, tumor-bearing mice were randomized into two groups
and injected i.p. with saline or SK1-I (20 mg/kg) every other day until day 49.
A, Kaplan Meier survival curves for animals implanted with LN229 cells treated
with vehicle or SK1-I. B, representative magnetic resonance imaging images
at day 48 are shown: T2-weighted images of vehicle and SK1-I–treated
animals. Note the dramatic effect of SK1-I on tumor growth compared with the
massive tumor in untreated animal. C, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image
of SK1-I–treated animal. D, intracranial tumors of vehicle and SK1-I–treated
animals were visualized by confocal microscopy for GFP expression (green )
after counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 (blue ). Representative sections at
the site of injection are shown. Scale bars, 100 Am.

Currently available therapies only minimally improve the
prognosis of GBM patients, and new therapeutic targets are
desperately needed. Accumulating evidence suggests that SphK1 is
an attractive new target. SphK1 message and protein levels are upregulated in GBM (2) and in astrocytoma tissues compared with
adjacent normal brain (3). Patients whose tumors were among the
highest one-third with regard to SphK1 expression survived a
median of 102 days, whereas those within the lower two-thirds
survived a median of 357 days (2). High expression of SphK1
was shown to be a predictor of poor prognosis for astrocytoma
patients (3).
Here, we show that targeting SphK1 with SK1-I suppressed
proliferation of several human glioblastoma cell lines, including
U373, LN229, U87, and U118 cells as well as nonestablished GBM6
cells. SK1-I also potently induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion
of these cells. Similar to the effects of SK1-I, down-regulation of

SphK1 expression has been shown to reduce glioblastoma cell
growth, survival, migration, and invasion (2). SK1-I was effective in
GBM that are mutant for PTEN or p53 or have a constitutively
activated form of EGFR. This is particularly important because
>80% of GBMs show strong Akt activation, many due to lost or
mutated PTEN. Activation of EGFR is also a critical pathogenetic
event, with amplifications, mutations, or rearrangements commonly observed (33). SK1-I also showed significant antitumor
activity in vivo, inducing GBM tumor cell apoptosis and reducing
tumor vascularization.
We have begun to unravel the mechanisms by which inhibition
of SphK1 by SK1-I so profoundly reduces proliferation and survival
of GBM in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. SK1-I rapidly
suppresses phosphorylation of Akt and its targets p70S6K and
GSK3h, and thus interferes with signaling through the Akt pathway,
which is frequently activated in gliomagenesis (33). This inhibition
by SK1-I is not due to a direct effect on Akt, as it did not inhibit Akt
activity in an in vitro kinase assay (11). It is also well accepted that
S1P produced by activation of SphK1 is released from cells and
stimulates its receptors that are linked to activation of Akt. Indeed,
the reduction of S1P levels by SK1-I is rapid and could contribute
to decreased phosphorylation of Akt. The effects of SK1-I may not
be mediated solely by reduction of ‘‘inside-out signaling’’ by S1P
but also by reduction of intracellular S1P. Our results are consistent
with previous reports showing that SphK1 and intracellular S1P are
critical for Akt activation and cell proliferation independently of
S1P receptors (6, 34). Moreover, in 1321N1 glioblastoma cells, DNA
synthesis and cyclin D expression were increased in a SphK1- and
Akt-dependent manner independently of S1P receptors (6). In
agreement, overexpression of SphK1 promotes cell survival and
growth even in cells devoid of functional S1PRs (34). Similarly,
overexpression of SphK1 is a S1P receptor–independent oncogenic
event in progression of erythroleukemia that involves activation of
Akt (35). In agreement with previous results in leukemia cells (11),
SK1-I not only inhibited S1P production in glioma cells, it also
increased levels of its proapoptotic precursor ceramide that has
been shown to cause growth inhibition and apoptosis by inhibiting
Akt (25). Thus, biphasic inhibition of Akt is likely due to a rapid
decrease in intracellular S1P and later sustained increases in
ceramide. Furthermore, a recent study in glioma cells showed that

inhibition of the Akt pathway strongly up-regulated ceramide
levels by inhibiting conversion of ceramide to complex sphingolipids due to reduction of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi
trafficking of ceramide (36). Because ceramide in turn further
inhibits Akt, this positive feedback loop amplifies the apoptotic
effect of SK1-I. Activation of JNK may also be due to inhibition of
Akt following SK1-I treatment as several studies raised the
intriguing possibility that the ability of Akt to inhibit JNK signaling
is due to phosphorylation of specific upstream targets in this
pathway (37, 38).
Down-regulation of SphK1, similar to SK1-I, causes a marked
elevation in levels of ceramide (20–23). Consistent with the higher
expression of SphK1 in GBM, ceramide levels are lower in human
gliomas compared with surrounding brain tissue, and are inversely
related to tumor progression and short patient survival (39). Thus,
actions of SphK1 might be related to its role in regulation of
ceramide levels.
The existence of redundant survival pathways suggests that
targeting a single dysregulated pathway may not be sufficient to
eliminate tumors. Indeed, it has been suggested that effective GBM
therapy may require combinations of inhibitors targeting multiple
signaling pathways (40). Our finding that inhibiting SphK1 with
SK1-I further enhanced glioblastoma cell lethality induced by
inhibitors of other important signaling pathways that are
frequently desregulated in GBM may have implications for the
design of protocols combining SphK1 inhibitors together with
conventional anticancer agents or experimental therapeutics.
