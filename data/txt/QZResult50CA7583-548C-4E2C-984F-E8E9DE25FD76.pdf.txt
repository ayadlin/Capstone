Abstract
We describe the design, generation, and in vitro evaluation of
targeted amphipathic fusion peptides and immunoconjugates
for the ablation of prostate cancer cells. The overexpression of
the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was exploited
as means to specifically deliver cytotoxic peptides to prostate
cancer cells. Cationic amphipathic lytic peptides were
chosen as cytotoxic agents due to their ability to depolarize
mitochondrial membranes and induce apoptosis. Specific
delivery of the lytic peptide was facilitated by PSMA-targeting
peptides and antibodies. Our results indicate that although
the use of PSMA-targeted peptides only modestly enhanced
the cytotoxic activity of the lytic peptide, peptide-antibody
conjugates were two orders of magnitude more potent than
untargeted peptide. In addition to quantifying the cytotoxic
activities of the individual constructs, we also investigated
the mechanisms of cell death induced by the fusion peptides
and immunoconjugates. Although fusion peptides induced
oncotic/necrotic death in cells, treatment with immunoconjugates resulted in apoptotic death. In summary, immunoconjugates based on lytic peptides are a promising class of
therapeutics for prostate cancer therapy and warrant further
investigation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6368–75]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and
is the second leading cause of cancer death in men; f30,000 deaths
occur every year in the United States due to the disease
(1, 2). Localized prostate cancer is generally treated with surgery
(radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy, or cryotherapy (3).
However, disease relapse after surgery is a common occurrence,
mainly due to the outgrowth of minimal residual disease (3).
Currently, patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic
prostate cancer are treated by androgen deprivation alone or
in combination with local therapy. Although most patients initially
respond to androgen deprivation, a large fraction of patients suffer
disease progression and develop androgen-independent, hormonerefractory prostate cancer. The metastasis of these androgenindependent cells, which are also resistant to conventional therapies
such as radiotherapy, is the major cause of death in prostate cancer.
Treatment options in these cases are fairly limited, and most
available treatments rely on chemotherapeutic drugs (4), which
have variable efficacies and severe side effects. As a result, there

is a need to develop site-specific (targeted) therapeutics for the
treatment of residual and metastatic prostate cancer.
The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II
membrane glycoprotein with an intracellular segment (amino acids
1–18), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 19–43), and an
extensive extracellular domain (amino acids 44–750; refs. 5, 6).
PSMA is abundantly expressed in all stages of prostate cancer
disease; the expression of the protein increases in cases of
hormone-refractory disease, metastasis, and advanced disease,
making it an attractive target for site-specific prostate cancer
therapy (7–11). Although PSMA is also expressed by cells in the
small intestine, proximal renal tubules, and salivary glands, the
level of expression in these tissues is 100- to 1,000-fold less than in
prostate tissue, rendering a high degree of potential selectivity for
site-specific therapeutic agents (5, 7–11). Furthermore, PSMA is
also expressed in the neovasculature of a wide variety of malignant
neoplasms, including prostate, lung, colon, breast, and others, but
not in normal vascular endothelium (12). Significantly, PSMA and
PSMA-antibody complexes have been shown to undergo internalization through clathrin-coated pits (12, 13), indicating that the
receptor can be used for intracellular delivery of therapeutics.
Consequently, different strategies, including antibodies and antibody-conjugated toxins, have been investigated for targeting
PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells (14–16).
Peptides/fusion peptides are increasingly gaining popularity as
therapeutic agents for a variety of applications (17), including
antiretroviral therapy (18), nucleic acid delivery (19), tumor vaccines
(20), antimicrobial therapy (21), and neurodegenerative diseases (22).
Peptide-based therapeutics are also attractive candidates for anticancer therapy (23–26), including prostate cancer (27, 28). Peptide
therapeutics are easily produced using either recombinant or solidphase chemical synthesis techniques and are generally less expensive
than antibody-based therapeutics. In addition, as opposed to
immunoconjugates, the small size of fusion peptides makes it possible to deliver them using routes other than intraveneous injection
(17). However, the use of peptides as targeting agents in site-specific
delivery is often limited by their low binding affinities to their
respective targets compared with those of antibodies. Furthermore,
their small molecular size results in rapid clearance by the
reticuloendothelial system and degradation by proteases in the body.
The antimicrobial peptide KLA (ref. 29; single-letter amino acid
sequence: KLAKLAKKLAKLAK) has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, presumably due to its ability to depolarize mitochondrial membranes (23). The large negative potential (180 mV)
across the mitochondrial membrane (30) promotes the accumulation of the positively charged amphipathic peptide at its surface. In
time, this localization results in membrane depolarization, a
membrane permeability transition, and the release of mitochondrial
contents into the cytoplasm. The release of proapoptotic proteins
from the mitochondria, including cytochrome c, second mitochondrial derived activator of caspase, and apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF), ultimately results in apoptosis (31).

Amphipathic Peptide-Based Prostate Cancer Therapeutics

We describe the design, generation, and evaluation of PSMAtargeted fusion peptides and antibody-peptide conjugates as sitespecific therapeutics for advanced prostate cancer disease. The
recent identification of peptides targeting the extracellular portion
of PSMA (32) enables the development of peptide-based strategies
for targeting malignant prostatic tissue. We designed a fusion
peptide composed of a PSMA-targeting peptide (PTP) and the
cationic amphipathic peptide KLA, and investigated the in vitro
efficacy, selectivity, and mechanism of cell death induced by the
PTP-KLA fusion peptide in LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate
cancer cell lines. In addition, we explored the in vitro efficacy and
mechanisms of cell death induced by anti-PSMA antibody-KLA
immunoconjugates. Our results indicate that the although the
PTP-KLA fusion peptide possesses only moderate potency, the
antibody-KLA conjugate potently and selectively induces cell death
in PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells, thus meriting further investigation as a potential therapeutic for prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP
(PSMA positive) and PC-3 (PSMA negative) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI
1640 (ATCC) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Corp.) + 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). PC-3 cells were cultured in F-12K
media (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The
cells were cultured at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. All chemicals were
purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified.
Fusion peptides. The following peptides were purchased from the Tufts
University Core Facility, Medford, MA:
1. KLA: HHHHHKLAKLAKKLAKLAKC (the cationic amphipathic, lytic
peptide sequence is in bold font)
2. PTP: CQKHHNYLCGGHHHHH (the PTP, ref. 32, is in bold font)
3. PTP-KLA: CQKHHNYLCGGKLAKLAKKLAKLAKHHHHH
The peptides were chemically synthesized and purified by highperformance liquid chromatography. The molecular weights of the purified
fractions were verified by mass spectrometry, and those fractions (>98%
purity) that corresponded to the correct peptide molecular weight were
lyophilized for use in experiments. Stock solutions of the lyophilized
peptides were prepared in PBS, aliquoted, and stored at 20jC. Peptide
concentrations were calculated using the ninhydrin assay (33). For
cyclization of PTP (via formation of a disulfide bond between C1 and C9),
0.1 mg/mL peptide in deionized water was oxidized in air at room
temperature for 4 days. The formation of the disulfide bond was verified
using Ellman’s reagent (Pierce Biotechnology) and cysteine standards as
described in the vendor’s protocol. The peptide was then lyophilized
and resuspended in sterile PBS. All peptides were >98% pure and were
sterile filtered (polyethersulfone 0.2-Am syringe filter, Nalgene) immediately
before use.
Antibody-KLA conjugation. The anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody,
MLN591, was a gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. The MLN591
antibody was dialyzed thrice against PBS using a 3,500 molecular weight
cutoff float-a-lyzer membrane (Spectrum Labs) at 4jC. The MLN591
antibody was then conjugated with the KLA peptide using an N-succinidyl3-(2-pyridylothio)propionate (SPDP) linker (Pierce). Briefly, MLN591
(1 mg/mL; 1 mL) was reacted with 20 AL of 5 mmol/L SPDP dissolved in
DMSO at room temperature for 15 min with shaking. Unreacted SPDP was
removed by gel filtration using a Bio-Rad 10G desalting column (3 mL,
exclusion limit 3 kDa) under gravity. Fractions (1 mL) were collected by
flowing PBS through the column; the fractions were concentrated using a
spin vacuum system and pooled to make a final volume of 1 mL. To verify
the conjugation of the SPDP linker to the antibody, 100 AL of the pooled
fractions were diluted to 1 mL and reacted with 10 AL DTT (15 mg/mL in
PBS) for 15 min. DTT treatment results in release of for pyridine-2-thione

which can be monitored at 343 nm and is an indicator of the conjugation of
the SPDP linker to MLN591. The number of SPDP molecules conjugated per
MLN591 molecule was determined using the SPDP conjugation protocol
(Pierce). The MLN591-SPDP conjugate was then reacted with 300 AL of KLA
peptide (200–300 Amol/L in PBS) at room temperature. Before the reaction,
400 AL of KLA was mixed with 10 mg of Reductacryl (EMD Biosciences Inc.)
for 10 min to reduce cysteine thiols and enable conjugation to the MLN591SPDP conjugate. Following the reduction step, 300 AL of the reduced
peptide solution was recovered from the resin by centrifugation at 11,000  g
for 10 min. The kinetics of the MLN591-KLA conjugation reaction were
monitored using absorbance at 343 nm; in all cases, the reaction was
complete within 3 to 4 h. The number of KLA molecules conjugated to the
MLN591 antibody was estimated as described previously. Using this
protocol, we were consistently able to conjugate three to five molecules
of KLA per molecule of MLN591. Finally, the MLN591-KLA reaction mixture
was dialyzed thrice against PBS at 4jC to remove unreacted KLA, sterilefiltered through a 0.22-Am syringe filter, and stored at 4jC for further use.
Cytotoxicity assays. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were plated in 24-well cell
culture plates (Corning Inc.) at a density of 125,000 cells per well and
allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were incubated with different
concentrations of KLA, PTP-KLA, and MLN591-KLA, followed by an
analysis for viability. Briefly, following individual treatments, cells were
treated with 100 AL calcein AM-ethidium homodimer stock solutions
(Invitrogen; final concentrations: calcein, 2 Amol/L; ethidium homodimer,
4 Amol/L) for 30 min, centrifuged (Beckman GS-6R) at 4jC, washed with
1 mL PBS, centrifuged again at 4jC, resuspended in 1 mL PBS, and
immediately analyzed using flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter Epics Altra).
A total of 10,000 events were recorded for each sample, and cells that
stained red (ethidium homodimer positive) were considered dead. Cell
viability and proliferation was also analyzed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit (ATCC) using
absorbance at 570 nm. For the evaluation of antibody-based conjugates,
cells were treated with buffer-exchanged MLN591 (MLN591 dialyzed thrice
against PBS at 4jC), MLN591-KLA, or equivalent amounts of PBS (control)
for 72 h, after which they were harvested and analyzed for viability as
described above. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.
Apoptosis assays. For determination of the sub-G0 phase population,
LNCaP cells were treated with the peptides and the antibody conjugate as
described above, centrifuged, fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h at room
temperature, washed twice with PBS, and stained with propidium iodide for
45 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry; a
total of 10,000 events were evaluated. Apoptosis/oncosis was also
investigated using the annexin V–FLUOS/propidium iodide staining kit
(Roche Applied Sciences). Briefly, following treatment, LNCaP cells were
washed with 500 AL PBS and 20 AL annexin V–FLUOS, and propidium
iodide were dissolved in the incubation buffer, and cells were incubated
with 50 AL of this stock solution for 30 min. Cells were then washed with
500 AL PBS and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200M,
Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Cells stained with annexin V–FLUOS alone
(green fluorescence) were considered apoptotic, whereas those that stained
both green and red were considered oncotic.
To probe the possible involvement of the caspase-mediated apoptotic
pathway, cells were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk
(100 Amol/L; R&D Systems) for 2 h before treatment with KLA and PTPKLA peptides and MLN591-KLA conjugates. Cell viability was determined at
24 h for the peptides and at 72 h for MLN591-KLA immunoconjugates as
described above; viability of cells treated with the inhibitor was compared
with untreated cells to determine the involvement of the caspase-mediated
apoptotic pathway. The homogeneous caspase assay (Roche Applied
Sciences) was used to investigate caspase activation in LNCaP cells treated
with immunoconjugates, following protocols recommended by the vendor.
The release of rhodamine, which is an indicator of caspase activity in the
assay, was detected by fluorescence, and fluorescence intensity was used to
compare caspase activation across different treatments.
Mitochondrial depolarization. The JC-1 dye (Invitrogen) forms redfluorescent J-aggregates upon localization in healthy mitochondria, whereas
the monomeric form of the dye fluoresces green in the cytoplasm (34).

PTP enhances the cytotoxic efficacy of KLA in PSMAexpressing LNCaP cells. Although well documented in literature
(6, 35), we first verified the presence and absence of PSMA on the
surface of LNCaP and PC-3 cells, respectively, using immunofluorescence (data not shown). The cationic amphipathic untargeted
KLA peptide induced significant nonspecific cell death (> 70% loss
in viability) in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells at concentrations
>70 Amol/L (Fig. 1A). However, although lower KLA concentrations
(35 Amol/L) induced death in LNCaP cells, no PC-3 cell death was
observed under these conditions. Addition of the PSMA-targeting
peptide (PTP) to KLA increased its potency in LNCaP cells, but not
PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A). The loss of viability in LNCaP cells was accompanied by characteristic cell detachment and clumping (Fig. 1B).
To evaluate the mechanism by which PTP enhances the potency of
KLA, competitive inhibition experiments were carried out to
determine if PTP-KLA is internalized via specific interaction with
the PSMA receptor. Competitive inhibition experiments indicated
the inhibition of PTP-KLA activity by PTP (Fig. 1C). Although 25
Amol/L PTP completely reversed the cytotoxic effects of 22 Amol/L
PTP-KLA on LNCaP cells, less inhibition was observed upon raising
the PTP-KLA concentration to 30 Amol/L. We verified that PTP alone
was not cytotoxic under these conditions (data not shown). Preincubation with 500 nmol/L anti-PSMA antibody (MLN591) also resulted
in a reduction in cell death induced by PTP-KLA (data not shown).
PTP-KLA induces oncotic/necrotic death in LNCaP cells. We
then investigated the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis/oncosis)
induced by the two peptides in LNCaP cells. Preincubation with
the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk (100 Amol/L) did not inhibit
LNCaP cell death after treatment with 30 Amol/L PTP-KLA
(Fig. 2A), indicating that the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway
was not involved in cell death and further validating the
observation that oncosis was the primary mode of cell death. In
addition, LNCaP cells were treated with KLA and PTP-KLA and
stained with annexin V–FLUOS and propidium iodide to differentiate between purely apoptotic populations from a mixture of late
apoptotic/oncotic ones. Cells treated with 30 Amol/L PTP-KLA
stained positive for propidium iodide, indicating that the mode of
cell death induced by this concentration of the peptide was
primarily oncotic. Similar results were obtained with KLA
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Inhibition of the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-2 has been shown to enhance chemotherapeutic-induced
apoptotic death in prostate cancer cells (36). However, enhanced
cell death was not observed when cells were preincubated with
a cell-permeable Bcl-2 inhibitor (2 Amol/L; results not shown) for
90 min followed by incubation with 25 Amol/L PTP-KLA for 24 h.
To further investigate the mode of cell death, LNCaP cells were
treated with different concentrations of KLA and PTP-KLA for
24 h, fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and
analyzed by flow cytometry. Lower PTP-KLA concentrations
(10 Amol/L) induced mainly apoptotic death in a small fraction
of LNCaP cells as indicated by a small increase in the sub-G0
population of cells (Fig. 2B-i). However, higher concentrations of
PTP-KLA (25 Amol/L) induced oncotic death; Fig. 2B-ii indicates a
profile characteristic of cells undergoing G0-phase arrest. DNA
laddering assays supported these results (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Taken together, these results indicate that whereas low micromolar
(<15 Amol/L) concentrations of PTP-KLA and KLA induce
apoptosis in LNCaP cells, the percentage of dead/dying cells was
significantly lower (<25%) than when high micromolar (>30 Amol/L)

concentrations were used. Use of higher peptide concentrations,
however, resulted in oncotic/necrotic death. Finally, LNCaP cells
were treated with KLA, PTP-KLA, or equivalent volume of PBS
(control) for 24 h, stained with JC-1, and analyzed by flow
cytometry to investigate mitochondrial depolarization induced by
the KLA peptide (23). The decrease in the red/green fluorescence
ratio upon treatment with 30 Amol/L PTP-KLA indicated a
significant loss of mitochondrial potential (Fig. 2C).

Evaluation of MLN591-KLA (Antibody-Peptide)
Conjugates
Conjugation of KLA to anti-PSMA antibody MLN591
enhances its potency in LNCaP cells. In addition to the fusion
peptides described above, we investigated MLN591-KLA immuno-

conjugates as potential site-specific therapeutics for prostate
cancer. Briefly, primary amines on the MLN591 antibody were
reacted with the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker SPDP to obtain
MLN591-SPDP conjugates. The KLA peptide was then conjugated
to the activated MLN591 antibody via the thiol group of the COOHterminal cysteine on the peptide. A ratio of three to five peptide
molecules per antibody molecule was consistently obtained using
this method.
The antibody-KLA conjugate was significantly more cytotoxic to
LNCaP cells than KLA or PTP-KLA. Figure 3A compares the cell
viability of LNCaP and PC-3 cells when treated with different
concentrations of MLN591-KLA for 72 h; no loss of cell viability was
observed in either cell line at 24 h. The MLN591-KLA conjugate had
no effect on PC-3 cell viability but induced significant cell death in

LNCaP cells, indicating selectivity of the conjugate toward PSMAexpressing LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). Unconjugated MLN591 did not
result in a loss of cell viability in either PC-3 or LNCaP cells.
Furthermore, we verified that LNCaP cell viability was unaffected
by treatment with equivalent concentrations of either KLA or PTPKLA for 72 h (data not shown).
Figure 3B shows phase-contrast images of the morphologic
changes in LNCaP cells and the corresponding fluorescence images
showing ethidium homodimer staining. LNCaP cells treated with
unconjugated MLN591 (0.4 Amol/L; Fig. 3B-ii) exhibit normal
morphology, similar to cells treated with PBS (Fig. 3B-i), with only a
few cells in each field staining with ethidium homodimer. In
contrast, cells treated with MLN591-KLA (0.4 Amol/L) exhibit
extensive cell death, indicated by rounding, detachment, and
extensive staining with ethidium homodimer (Fig. 3B-iii).
MLN591-KLA induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells. The homogeneous caspase assay was carried out to investigate caspase
activation in LNCaP cells upon incubation with MLN591-KLA for
72 h. Figure 4A shows caspase activation when LNCaP cells were
treated with MLN591-KLA, whereas those treated with MLN591
exhibited caspase activity comparable to cells treated with PBS.

The assay detects caspases 2, 3, and 7, indicating a role for these
caspases in MLN591-KLA–mediated cell death. In addition, LNCaP
cells were preincubated with 100 Amol/L of the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk for 2 h before treatment with the MLN591KLA conjugate. Inhibition of caspase activity with z-VAD-Fmk
increased LNCaP viability (Fig. 4B), supporting a role for the
caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway in MLN591-KLA–induced cell
death. Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide–stained
LNCaP cells after MLN591-KLA treatment indicated that a
significant fraction of the cells (>80%) were apoptotic, as indicated
by the sub-G0 population in Fig. 4C-i. In contrast, equivalent
concentrations of the MLN591 antibody did not induce apoptosis
in these cells (Fig. 4C-ii). In addition, the MLN591-KLA conjugates
induced mitochondrial depolarization in LNCaP cells, which is
consistent with the proposed mechanism for cell death induced by
the cationic amphipathic peptide KLA (ref. 23; Fig. 4D). The
mitochondrial integrity of LNCaP cells treated with the unconjugated MLN591 antibody was similar to that of the untreated control.
Comparison of KLA, PTP-KLA, and MLN591-KLA. Dose
response studies were employed to determine the in vitro LC50
values (the concentration required to induce death in 50% LNCaP

cells. The LC50 value of the MLN591-KLA conjugate for LNCaP cells
was 0.28 Amol/L, which is approximately 70-fold lower than that of
PTP-KLA (19 Amol/L) and more than two orders of magnitude
lower than that of KLA (41 Amol/L), indicating that the anti-PSMA
antibody significantly enhances the potency of the KLA peptide
(Fig. 5). In addition, whereas PTP-KLA and KLA induced oncotic
death in LNCaP cells, MLN591-KLA induced caspase-mediated
apoptotic death.

Discussion
A number of chemotherapeutic strategies have been investigated
for the ablation of advanced prostate cancer cells (4). Of these,
targeted biologicals represent an emerging class of therapeutics
that can potentially reduce nonspecific cytotoxicity in collateral
organs such as the urethra and bladder, especially in cases of
residual disease and secondary metastasis. The transformation of
androgen-dependent prostate cancer disease to a highly tumori-

www.aacrjournals.org

genic, metastatic, and androgen-independent phenotype is a result
of the accumulation of significant genetic changes (2, 37). Several
studies have indicated that the overexpression of antiapoptotic
proteins plays a direct role in the abnormal growth of prostatic
tissue and correlates with the poor response to radiotherapy (38).
For example, overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2
inhibits the mitochondrial pore transition, contributing to the
resistance of the transformed cell to apoptosis. Therapeutic
strategies that induce mitochondrial depolarization, therefore, are
attractive because they can bypass apoptosis resistance mechanisms that act upstream of the mitochondria.
Energy from respiration is stored as a potential and pH gradient
across mitochondrial membranes in mammalian cells (chemoosmotic theory; ref. 39). Once internalized, cationic amphipathic
molecules preferentially localize at the mitochondria due to the
large negative potential gradient across the mitochondrial
membrane. Accumulation of a significant concentration of these
molecules at the mitochondrial membrane leads to its disruption
and, consequently, depolarization, ultimately leading to apoptosis.

We therefore investigated the cationic amphipathic peptide KLA as
a potential therapeutic candidate in prostate cancer.
We exploited the overexpression of the PSMA on the surface of
prostate cancer cells as means to selectively deliver KLA to these
cells. We investigated the potency and mechanism of cell death in
human prostate cancer cell lines treated with untargeted, peptidetargeted, and monoclonal antibody–targeted KLA constructs.
Peptides targeting the extracellular portion of PSMA have recently
been identified from a phage display library and have been shown
to possess micromolar (Amol/L) binding affinities to the extracellular portion of the receptor (32). In addition, aptamers (40–42) and
monoclonal antibodies (43, 44) have also been used to target the
PSMA receptor.
In vitro investigation indicated that the LC50 value was 41 Amol/L
for untargeted KLA and 19 Amol/L for the targeted PTP-KLA
peptide. The use of the PSMA-targeting peptide (PTP) sequence,
therefore, modestly enhanced the efficacy (2-fold) of the resulting
PTP-KLA fusion compared with the untargeted KLA peptide.
Coincubation of PTP-KLA with PTP resulted in lower LNCaP cell
death, indicating that the fusion peptide acted by interacting with
the PSMA receptor. However, this interaction is in addition to the
nonspecific uptake of the fusion peptide mediated by the cellpenetrating activity of the KLA segment.
Contrasting mechanisms of cell death have been proposed for
cationic amphipathic peptide-based cancer therapeutics (23, 25, 45,
46). Although some reports indicate that these peptides induce
apoptosis due to their ability to depolarize mitochondrial membranes (23, 25, 45), others have reported that these peptides induce
plasma membrane lysis leading to oncotic/necrotic death in cancer
cells (47). We therefore investigated the mechanism of cell death
induced by the peptide- and antibody-targeted KLA constructs.
At concentrations less than 15 Amol/L, PTP-KLA induced
apoptotic death in a small fraction of LNCaP cells as indicated
by propidium iodide staining/flow cytometry. However, higher
concentrations (30 Amol/L) of PTP-KLA induced oncosis in a larger
percentage (ca. 80%) of LNCaP cells. These results indicate that
plasma membrane permeabilization and cell lysis contribute to
necrotic cell death and are similar to those previously reported in

Figure 5. Comparison of the in vitro LC50 values of untargeted, peptidetargeted, and antibody-targeted fusions/conjugates of KLA with LNCaP cells.

the literature (47–49). Thus, in the case of PTP-KLA, the relative
affinities of PTP-PSMA interaction and the KLA-plasma membrane
interaction may represent competing processes underlying cellular
uptake and death. This observation has implications for the design
of targeted peptide therapeutics: to engineer fusion peptide
therapeutics with high selectivities, the affinity of the targeting
peptide (e.g., PTP) must be significantly greater than the plasma
membrane lytic activity of the cytotoxic peptide (e.g., KLA). We also
verified that the treatment with both KLA and PTP-KLA resulted
in mitochondrial depolarization. However, it is not clear whether
mitochondrial depolarization was responsible for the cell death
induced by KLA and PTP-KLA. It is more likely that the observed
depolarization is a consequence of oncosis.
Antibody-based conjugates have been explored as potential
therapeutics for a number of malignancies, including prostate
cancer. We conjugated KLA to MLN591, a monoclonal antibody that
targets the extracellular portion of the PSMA. This antibody has
nanomolar affinity for the receptor and can therefore deliver
therapeutic cargo with high selectivity to prostate cancer cells that
overexpress the receptor. In contrast to the peptides (KLA and PTPKLA), no cell death was observed when LNCaP cells were treated
with the MLN591-KLA conjugate for 24 h. Cells typically entered
apoptosis 36 to 48 h after treatment, necessitating measurement of
cell viability at 72 h. Significantly lower (submicromolar) concentrations of the MLN591-KLA conjugate were required to induce
death in LNCaP cells when compared with PTP-mediated delivery;
the antibody enhanced the efficacy of the conjugate by two orders of
magnitude compared with the untargeted peptide. Both MLN591
and MLN591-KLA were not toxic to PSMA-negative PC-3 cells under
the described experimental conditions. Although the decrease of the
LC50 of the MLN591-KLA conjugate are in agreement with previous
reports on immunoconjugates (45), the exact mechanism by which
conjugation of KLA to MLN591 results in the decrease of the LC50
value of the MLN591-KLA conjugate is not known. It is hypothesized
that the high binding affinity of MLN591 to the receptor results in
the localization and subsequently, internalization of KLA molecules
inside LNCaP cells. In addition, the presence of a cleavable disulfide
bond in the linker region between MLN591 and KLA can play a role
in the release of the KLA peptide into the cytoplasm which
ultimately results in LNCaP cell death (50).
Investigation of cell death mechanisms confirmed the role of
caspase-mediated apoptosis in the ablation of LNCaP cells treated
with MLN591-KLA. A significant proportion (>80%) of fixed LNCaP
cells stained with propidium iodide showed characteristics of a subG0 population when compared with the control (cells treated with
equivalent PBS), indicating that these cells underwent apoptosis. In
contrast, cells treated with an equivalent concentration of the
unconjugated antibody did not exhibit the presence of a sub-G0
population, indicating that the antibody alone did not induce
apoptosis in these cells. These results are consistent with the cell
death results (ethidium homodimer staining) in Fig. 3B and indicate
that apoptosis is the primary mechanism of cell death induced by
MLN591-KLA conjugates. Furthermore, caspase activation was
observed in LNCaP cells treated with the MLN591-KLA conjugate.
In addition to the enhanced targeting affinity due to the MLN591
antibody, it is possible that steric effects also play a role in
preventing cell membrane lysis by the lytic KLA peptide.
Conjugation of the (small) lytic peptide to the (large) antibody
can keep the former away from the cell membrane, whereas this is
not possible in case of the much smaller PTP-KLA fusion peptides.
Inhibition of caspase activity resulted in an increase in cell viability,

indicating a role for the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway.
Finally, we verified that the MLN591-KLA conjugate induced
mitochondrial depolarization in LNCaP cells after 72 h, in accordance with the previously proposed mechanism of KLA. However,
whereas it is tempting to speculate that mitochondrial depolarization is the cause of cell death induced by MLN591-KLA in
LNCaP cells, our results do not conclusively prove this. To do so
will necessitate the correlation of mitochondrial depolarization
kinetics with apoptosis kinetics in LNCaP cells treated with
MLN591-KLA, studies that are now ongoing in our laboratory.
Future work will also focus on evaluating the antibody-KLA construct in vivo, with orthotopically implanted LNCaP tumors in mice.

Conclusions
We have designed, generated, and evaluated targeted fusion
peptides and immunoconjugates based on the cationic amphipathic peptide KLA as potential targeted therapeutics for prostate
cancer. Our results indicate that antibody-KLA conjugates have
promise as potential therapeutics and warrant further investigation. We also investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by

these molecular therapeutics. In cases where cationic amphipathic
peptides are used, the affinity of the targeting sequence to the
receptor must be significantly higher than the membranepermeabilizing affinity of the lytic peptide to minimize nonspecific
death. Thus, whereas lower concentrations of MLN591-KLA are
sufficient to induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells due to the enhanced
affinity of MLN591 antibody to the receptor, further engineering of
peptides targeting the PSMA is required in order for them to be
useful in potential therapeutic applications.
