ABSTRACT
We synthesized, characterized and tested in a panel of cancer cell lines, nine
new bipyridine gold(III) dithiocarbamate-containing complexes. In vitro studies
demonstrated that compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 were the most cytotoxic in prostate,
breast, ovarian cancer cell lines and in Hodgkin lymphoma cells with IC50 values lower
than the reference drug cisplatin. The most active compound 1 was more active than
cisplatin in ovarian (A2780cis and 2780CP-16) and breast cancer cisplatin-resistant
cells. Compound 1 determined an alteration of the cellular redox homeostasis leading
to increased ROS levels, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential,
cytochrome-c release from the mitochondria and activation of caspases 9 and 3.
The ROS scavenger NAC suppressed ROS generation and rescued cells from damage.
Compound 1 resulted more active in tumor cells than in normal human Mesenchymal
stromal cells. Gold compounds were active independent of p53 status: exerted
cytotoxic effects on a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with different p53
status and in the ovarian A2780 model where the p53 was knocked out. In conclusion,
these promising results strongly indicate the need for further preclinical evaluation
to test the clinical potential of these new gold(III) complexes.

INTRODUCTION

complexes, such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin are along
with the most commonly used anticancer agents [4].
The extensive clinical success of platinum compounds
has improved the synthesis of other platinum and nonplatinum metallodrugs that might demonstrate different
cytotoxic properties and characterized by a different
prototype of anticancer specificities, active against
cisplatin-resistant tumor cells and with an encouraging
toxicological profile. Thus, in the span of three to four

The breakthrough of the anticancer properties of
cisplatin cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2] around 1965, promoted very
much attention in the area of metal-based anticancer
agents [1]. The anticancer effects observed for cisplatin
suggested that platinum and non-platinum metal-based
compounds might be as valuable as organic anticancer
drugs [2, 3]. Cisplatin, and a few related platinum

decades, a variety of metal compounds were investigated
as potential anticancer agents based on several nonplatinum metals such as ruthenium, palladium, titanium,
gold and copper [2–10].
It is known that Au(III) is iso-electronic with d8
system and iso-structural with Pt(II). Due to the structural
similarity, the square planar gold(III) complexes have been
qualified as appropriate candidates for the potential anticancer activity evaluation [3, 11–14].
Since the beginning of 21th century, a series of
new gold(III) complexes turned out to be stable under
physiological conditions and also exhibited appreciable
in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity [12, 13,
15–18]. Parish et al. [19] described the synthesis of
stable gold(III) complex using damp (2-(Dimethylamino)
methyl)phenyl) as uni-negative bidentate ligand as an
analogy in the structural features of cisplatin as neutral
coordination complex in the mid of 1990s. The acceptable
solution stability of these gold(III) compounds permitted
to put into practice extensive both in vitro and in in vivo
pharmacological testing. Therefore, several other series of
cytotoxic gold(III) compounds were synthesized in other
laboratories around the world, including the gold(III)
dithiocarbamates [20] and the gold(III) porphyrins [21, 22].
Multidentate ligands such as polyamines, cyclam,
terpyridine and phenanthroline were preferentially used
in order to augment the stability of the gold(III) center
and target gold(III) complexes with cationic coordination
spheres [Au(en2)]3+, [Au(dien)Cl]2+, [Au(cyclam)]3+,
[Au(phen)Cl2]+ and [Au(terpy)Cl]2+ were characterized.
The investigation of their solution behavior was carried
out through a variety of physical and chemical methods
and demonstrated their stability [23, 24].
There are many examples of gold(III) complexes
linked to dithiocarbamate, polyamine, polypyridine
and their derivative ligands [2, 3]. In particular,
dithiocarbamate ligands were combined with gold(III)
complexes to inhibit the interaction of the metal center
with thiol-containing renal enzymes and avoid cisplatininduced nephrotoxicity [16].
In this connection, the idea of coupling the wellknown anticancer properties of some metal ions with a
potential chemo-protective function of dithiocarbamates
was turned out to be an effective strategy. In fact, some
gold(III) dithiocarbamate compounds were demonstrated
to be cytotoxic, to inhibit both the proteasome and the
thioredoxin reductase activity in human breast and prostate
cancer cell cultures as well as in tumor xenografts [2, 3,
15, 17, 18, 25, 26].
Some other gold(III) complexes of bipyridine were
synthesized. Akhmadullina et al. described the synthesis of
[(bipy)AuCl2]BF4 and [(phen)AuCl2]BF4 [27]. Casini et al.
prepared and characterized square planar gold(III) complexes
that contain functionalized bipyridine ligands of general

formula [Au(N^N)Cl2][PF6] [where N^N = 2,2′-bipyridine,
4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine, 4,4′-dimethoxy-2,2′-bipyridine
and 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine] [28].
Ogawa et al. [29] recently elaborated the
introduction of a Au(III) ion into a mesogenic core,
[M(Bdt)(Cnbpy)]+ (Bdt = 1,2-benzenedithiolato and
Cnbpy = 4,4′-di-alkyl-2,2′-bipyridine (n = 13 (4,4′-ditridecyl-2,2′-bipyridine (C13bpy)) and 8,10 (4,4′-di-(3octyltridecyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (C8,10bpy), leading to the
formation of ionic molecular assemblies in crystalline
and mesophases. Successive syntheses of precursor
complexes, [AuCl2(Cnbpy)]PF6 (n = 13 (1) and 8,10 (2)),
followed by the target complexes, [Au(Bdt)(Cnbpy)]PF6
(n = 13 (3) and 8,10 (4)), were achieved [29].
In order to improve the antitumor properties and
reduce toxic side-effects of the previously reported
gold(III) analogues, we designed new gold(III) complexes
[Au(BPY)(S2CNR2)]Cl2 (BPY = 2,2′-bipyridine,
5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine, or 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′bipyridine and R = Methyl, Ethyl, or benzyl in S2CNR2
is Dialkyl/aryldithiocarbammate) with nitrogen and
sulfur donor ligands. Here, we report synthesis, chemical
characterization, and in vitro anticancer activity of these
new gold(III) complexes.

RESULTS
Characterization by FT-IR
Gold(III) mixed ligands complexes 1–9 were
identified via the presence of the stretching bands around
3030 and 2925 cm-1 for ν(C–H) the aromatic (phenyl and
2,2′-dipyridyl) and ν(C–H) saturated aliphatic methyl
and ethyl groups of coordinated ligands respectively. All
gold(III) compounds exhibited characteristic absorbance
peaks primarily for ν(C–N) and ν(C–S). The infrared
region 1480–1550 cm-1 is mostly related with the R2N–
CSS ‘thioureide’ band in the IR spectra of dithiocarbamate
compounds which defines the carbon-nitrogen bond order
between a single bond at 1250–1350 cm-1 and a double
bond at 1640–1690 cm-1 [30]. The thioureide band,
ν(C–N) was detected at 1470–1490 cm-1 in compounds
1–9 respectively. These frequency absorption bands lie
in between those associated with single C–N and double
C = N bonds, hence the partial double bond character
of ‘thioureide’ bond was confirmed for all gold(III)
compounds [31]. The presence of strong absorption band
in the range of 1470–1550 in FTIR spectra clearly indicates
the formation dithiocarbamato gold(III) compounds
[32, 33]. Similarly, C = S stretching with medium intensity
around 1070 and 970 cm-1 for compounds 1–9 is an
additional evidence of the formation of mixed ligands
compounds. These absorption bands are comparable to
free sodium salt of diethyldithiocarbamate ligands [31].

Characterization by NMR

Stability determination and interactions with
lysozyme

The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of all nine
compounds are given in synthesis part of experimental
section and small downfield and upfield shifts for
proton(s) of the coordinated dimethyl dithiocarbamate,
diethyl dithiocarbamate and dibenzyldithiocarbamate
have been seen in gold(III) compounds 1–9 in
comparison to free dialkyl/diaryldithiocarbamate ligands
[24, 34, 35]. The 13C NMR spectra of compounds 4, 7 and
1 showed seven and six resonances respectively; which
confirmed the coordination of dimethyldithiocarmato
and bipyridyl ligands with Au(III) ion (given in synthesis
part of experimental section). The 13C NMR spectra of
compounds 5, 8 and 2 showed one additional chemical
shift comparative to compounds 4, 7 and 1 spectra as
expected. Whereas, multiple chemical shifts are observed
in the 13C NMR spectra of compounds 3, 6 and 9 due
to presence of dibenzyl and pyridyl functional groups.
There is an up-field chemical shift of NC = S carbon of
coordinated dialkyl/diaryldithiocarbamate ligands with
respect to free dialkyl/diaryldithiocarbamate ligands for
all gold(III) compounds. The 13C chemical shifts of NC
= S carbon of bonded dimethyl thiocarbamate, diethyl
thiocarbamate and dibenzyl thiocarbamate are observed
in the range 186–200 ppm in our synthesized compounds
1–9 [24, 34, 35].

Electronic spectra were recorded on each complex
freshly prepared in DMSO solution at room temperature.
Then, their electronic spectra were monitored over
24 hours at 37oC. The resulting UV-Vis absorption spectra
of compound 1, 2 and 3 are shown in Supplementary
Figure S4A–S4C. The UV spectra of the compounds
confirm the stability under physiological temperature.
The interaction between compounds 1–3 and the
lysozyme in solution have been probed by studying the
change in their electrochemical profiles in presence of
different concentration of protein (Supplementary Figures
S5, S6 and S7). Both CV and SWV demonstrated that
in the presence of lysozyme all compounds 1–3 showed
a substantial decrease in the peak current as well as a
clear peak potential shift (Supplementary Figures S5, S6
and S7). The significant change of their redox state due
to their interaction with lysozyme suggests a significative
chemical interaction of such gold compounds and proteins
[36]. This chemical aspect deserves high attention because
it could be involved in the mechanism of action of these
innovative molecules as anticancer drugs.

Cytotoxic effects
Gold(III)complexes (compounds 1–9) (Figure 1)
were tested for in vitro cytotoxicity toward human
Hodgkin lymphoma (L-540), androgen-resistant prostate
cancer (PC3), breast cancer (MCF-7) and ovarian
adenocarcinoma cisplatin-sensitive (A2780) and -resistant
(A2780cis) cell lines. For comparison purposes, cisplatin
activity was also evaluated.
In L-540 cells gold(III) complexes showed an IC50
higher or similar to that of cisplatin (Table 1). Compounds
3, 6 and 9, all characterized by the addition of two
benzoic groups (Figure 1, right panel), were less active
than cisplatin in all cell lines tested showing higher or
similar IC50 values (Tables 1 and 2). The other gold(III)
complexes (compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8) (Figure 1) were
generally more active than the reference drug cisplatin
with an IC50 ranging from 0.27 to 0.47 µM in MCF-7
cells, from 0.42 to 1.6 µM in PC3 cells (Table 1), from
0.18 to 0.73 µM in A2780 cells (Table 2) and from 0.17 to
0.45 µM in its cisplatin-resistant clone A2780cis (Table 2).
Compound 1 showed the lowest IC50 values in the entire
panel of the investigated tumor cell lines (Tables 1 and 2)
and its representative dose-response curves are shown in
Figure 2A. It was proved about 60-fold and 80-fold
more active than cisplatin in inhibiting cell proliferation
of cisplatin-resistant ovarian adenocarcinoma A2780cis
cells (Table 2) and breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Table 1),
respectively. With reference to Table 1, the IC50 values for

Mass spectrometry characterization
Positive-ion mode ESI mass spectra for
electrosprayed aqueous-methanol solutions of compounds
1, 2 and 3 are presented in Supplementary Figure S1.
The mass spectra profile of compounds 1, 2 and 3
present a common peak ion at 157 m/z corresponding
to the protoned 2,2′-bipyridine moiety ligand (a) or its
sodium adduct (b) at 179 m/z as reported for compound
3. The ESI-MS spectra of compound 1 presents an
intense peak ion at 437 m/z assigned to a positive
ion where Au(III) is coordinated by two dimethyl
dithiocarbamate moieties. Compound 2 presents
instead an intense peak at 493 m/z corresponding to the
coordination of two diethyl dithiocarbamate moieties and
analogously the ESI-MS scan for compound 3 presents
a signal at 741 m/z associated to the coordination of
two dibenzyldithiocarbamate moieties. Compounds 4,
5 and 6 in solution present the same ESI-MS behavior
of compounds 1, 2 and 3 with the differences that
in all ESI-MS spectra scan of compounds 4, 5 and 6
present a common positive Ion at 185 m/z that can be
assigned to the free protoned dimethyl-2,2-bipyridine
ligand (g) (Supplementary Figure S2). The structure of
the dithiocarbamate derivatives c, d and f is shown in
Supplementary Figure S3.

complex 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 are comparable. Using three
representative gold(III) complexes (compounds 1, 2 and 3)
with different cytotoxic activity, we demonstrated the
intracellular gold uptake by L-540 cells. Consistently with
the cytotoxic effects, the gold uptake of both compound 1
and 2 was greater than that of compound 3 (Supplementary
Figure S8A).

(IC75) induced a time-dependent activation of caspase 3
(Figure 2C). Apoptosis induction was confirmed by DNA
fragmentation (Figure 2D) with Apo-Direct analysis.
Compound 1 was active at the same concentration in both
cisplatin-sensitive (A2780) and -resistant (A2780cis) [38]
ovarian cancer cells, and resulted more active in tumor
cells than in normal human Mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSCs) (Supplementary Figure S8B) (IC50 = 0.96 µM).
The final DMSO concentration was un-effective (data not
shown).

Induction of apoptosis
There are several mechanisms involved in the
anticancer activity of Gold(I) and (III) complexes
including the induction of apoptosis [15, 17, 37].
Therefore, we evaluated Annexin-V/PI double
staining, caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation
(Figure 2) in tumor cells treated with the most active
gold(III) complex (compound 1). As shown in
Figure 2B, compound 1 induced apoptosis in the cell lines
tested. Treatment with compound 1 resulted in a substantial
phosphatidylserine exposure (Annexin-V) together with
an high percentage of cells permeable to PI staining, thus
supporting apoptosis as a major mechanism of cell death
(Figure 2B). Consistently, treatment with compound 1

Inhibition of mitochondrial functions and
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation
Treatment with Compound 1 promoted
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (Figure 3A)
and cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) release (Figure 3B) from the
mitochondria and consistently induced activation of
caspase 9 (Figure 3C), suggesting that the anticancer
activity involves the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic
pathway. Compound 1 (IC75) increased mitochondrial
ROS levels, and especially in breast cancer MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4A). In order to establish a possible relationship

between ROS overproduction and decreased viability,
tumor cells were incubated with the ROS scavenger
NAC (Figure 4A and 4B). NAC blocked ROS production
(Figure 4A) and almost completely neutralized the antiproliferative effect of compound 1 (Figure 4B), suggesting
that the cytotoxic/pro-apoptotic activity is due to ROS
generation. Cell cycle progression was only slightly
affected by compound 1 (data not shown).

p53 deleted (Null-p53) were utilized to determine whether
the new gold(III) complexes have p53 dependence.
Compounds (3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) showed an IC50 ranging
between 0.16–4.1 μM. Representative dose-response
curves in A549 cells are shown in Figure 5A, which
indicate that compounds 4 and 7 have greater potencies
than compounds 3, 6 and 9 also in lung cancer cells.
Dose-response curves were used to obtain IC50 values
in the entire NSCLC panel, and are shown in Figure
5B–5F. These IC50 values indeed demonstrate that
compound 4 (IC50, 0.12–0.31 μM) and 7 (IC50,
0.14–0.29 μM) have greater potencies (at least 10-fold)
than compound 3 (2.4–4.1 μM), 6 (1.5–2.8 μM) and 9
(2.1–3.9 μM) in all NSCLC cell lines. It is clear that

structural differences regulate the potency of the
molecules. Moreover, these results indicate that the IC50
values in WT- p53 models were similar to those in Mutand Null-p53 cell lines. To confirm that sensitivity to
gold(III) complexes was not dependent on p53 status,
we utilized WT-p53 A2780 ovarian cancer cells in which
p53 was knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology
(CRISPR p53 KO). The corresponding control cells were
transfected with a control plasmid and retained WT-p53
status. Results from the MTT assay revealed there were no
significant differences in IC50 for representative compounds
3 (CRISPR Control, 0.87 ± 0.11 μM vs. CRISPR p53 KO,
1.13 ± 0.39 μM ) and 4 (CRISPR Control, 0.087 ± 0.003
μM vs. CRISPR p53 KO, 0.083 ± 0.003 μM) (Figure 6).
Thus, the potential of the gold complexes to
circumvent this resistance was investigated. For this
purpose the IC50 and fold resistance (A2780cis/A2780)
values for selected gold complexes were determined using
the sensitive A2780 cancer cell line and the corresponding
cisplatin-resistant A2780cis and 2780CP-16 [39] cell
lines. While the A2780cis (resistant) cells showed an IC50

for cisplatin about 7-fold higher than A2780 (sensitive)
cells, the IC50 of the most active compounds (1, 2, 4, 5,
7, 8) resulted similar or lower in A2780cis respect to A2780
(fold resistance or resistant factor less than 1) (Table 2).
Similar results were obtained also in the 20-fold cisplatinresistant 2780CP cells (data not shown), indicating that gold
complexes under investigation in this study have the ability
to overcome cisplatin-resistance to a substantial extent.

DISCUSSION
The design of more active and less toxic antitumor
agents is a major goal to develop new-targeted therapeutic
strategies. Dithiocarbammate gold(III) complexes have
recently gained increasing attention due to their strong
cytotoxic effects associated with low nephrotoxicity and
their capability to overcome cisplatin-resistance [15, 16].
In this study we described the synthesis and
evaluated the anticancer activity of new bipyridine
gold(III) dithiocarbamate-containing complexes. They
demonstrated a potent cytotoxic activity in ovarian, lung,

induced apoptosis and Reactive Oxygen species. They
were active in cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells
and independently of p53 status in both lung and ovarian
cancer cell lines and less toxic in non-cancer human
Mesenchymal stromal cells.
These new gold(III) complexes have dithiocar­
bamate ligands containing methyl (compounds 1, 4, 7)
and ethyl (compounds 2, 5, 8) chains. The less active
complexes (3, 6 and 9) have dithiocarbamate ligands
containing dibenzyl substitution. The aliphatic containing
dithiocarbamate ligands showed a higher anticancer
activity respect to the benzyl dithiocarbamate complexes,
summarized as Me ~ Et >> benzyl dithiocarbamate
containing complexes. The different in vitro cytotoxic
effects could be attributed to the small side chain of
Methyl and Ethyl chains compared to the large dibenzyl
group. However, even if our results indicate the consistent
difference in potency (IC50) between different compounds,
higher potencies are not an indicator of success at the
clinical level, and this is well demonstrated by the ~10fold difference in potency between cisplatin and the equal
successful carboplatin [40]. Thus, other factors have to be
taken into consideration to assess the clinical potential of
less active new gold complexes, such as in vivo toxicity.
Cisplatin resistance is a critical factor that limits
its clinical utility [1, 41]. The most active compounds
(1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8) were able to overcome the resistance to
the reference drug cisplatin in ovarian and breast cancer
cells, ruling out the occurrence of any cross-resistance
phenomena. A fundamental mechanism of cisplatin
resistance is the failure of this drug to activate p53, even
in tumor cells primed for wild-type p53 function [42, 43].

Therefore, the identification of new drugs that do not
depend for their anticancer activity on wild-type p53 status
is an important goal since both NSCLC and ovarian cancer
patients with p53 mutation have shorter overall survival
as well as shorter time to progression [44, 45]. We found
that the anticancer activity of the new gold(III) complexes
was independent of p53 status: it was similar in WT-p53
models, in Mut- and Null-p53 cell lines and in WT-A2780
cells in which p53 was knocked out.
According to the above reported experimental
results, complex 1 exerted a potent cytotoxic effect by
inducing apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin-V, activation
of caspase 3 and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, it
induces mitochondrial membrane depolarization,
cytochrome-c release and caspase 9 activation, indicating
that its anticancer activity is exerted through the
mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway. It induced ROS
overproduction and growth inhibition, which was blocked
by pre-treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC. However,
we cannot exclude that thiol-containing antioxidant NAC
could block the effects of compound 1 by binding with the
active site of compound 1, as demonstrated for other gold
complexes [46].
We found that the investigated compounds are
able to interact with the small protein lysozymes.
Moreover, the ESI-MS experiments indicated that in
aqueous-methanol solution the compounds fast rearrange
to generate stable derivatives where the gold(III)
was coordinated by the four sulfur atom from two
dithiocarbamate moieties. Indeed, we cannot exclude
that such dithiocarbamate derivatives may have a role
in the biological activity of the gold complexes. Further
deep studies are however needed to better establish which

Figure 6: Cytotoxicity of gold complexes is independent of p53. The IC50 values for compound 3 and 4 were obtained in an A2780
clone following transfection with either CRISPR control (Control) or CRISPR p53-sgRNA plasmid (p53 KO). Data are presented as mean
+/− SEM of three independent experiments.

Bone Marrow (BM) derived human Mesenchymal
Stromal Cells (MSCs) were from Lonza (Lonza,
Verviers, Belgium). MSCs were maintained in MSGM
bullet kit (Lonza) and experiments were performed
in DMEM medium (Cambrex Bio Science, Milano,
Italy) supplemented with 10% FCS. To evaluate effects
of compound 1, MSCs (5.0 × 103) were seeded in
96-well flat-bottomed microplates (100 μL) and incubated
for 24 h (to allow cell adhesion) before drug testing.
The medium was then removed and replaced with fresh
medium containing compound 1 to be tested at increasing
concentrations (from 0.1 to 1 μM) at 37°C for 72 h. Each
treatment was performed in triplicate. Cell proliferation
was assayed using the MTT assay.

PC3 (2.5 × 104), MCF-7 (5.0 × 104), A2780 and
A2780cis (5.0 × 104), and L-540 cells (2.0 × 105/mL)
were incubated in six-well plates with compound 1
(IC75) (Figure 1) for 72 h. Annexin-V binding (BectonDickinson [BD] Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) together
with propidium iodide (PI) staining was detected in tumor
cells by flow cytometry, as described [37, 38]. Caspase
3 and 9 activation was evaluated using the fluorochrome
inhibitors of caspases (FLICA) Caspa-TagTM caspase-3/7
(FAM-DEVD-FMK) and caspase 9 (FAM-LETD)
(Chemicon International, Milan, Italy). Briefly, cells
were treated with compound 1 (IC75), then harvested,
washed and resuspended in warmed complete medium
supplemented with FLICA for 1 h and then immediately
analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA fragmentation was
assessed using the Apo-Direct kit (Becton-Dickinson
Pharmigen, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. For mitochondrial ROS evaluation, cells
treated with compound 1 were incubated with 5 µM of
MitoSox reagent working solution (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Red fluorescence
was immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Viable
cells were identified according to their forward and rightangle scattering, electronically gated and analyzed on a
FACScan flow cytometer (BD), using CellQuest software
(BD). In another series of experiments, cells were exposed
to compound 1 (IC75) in the presence or absence of the
antioxidant and ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC;
5 mM) (Sigma). After 72 h, ROS formation and viable
cells number were evaluated by flow cytometry and
trypan blue dye exclusion assay, respectively. To evaluate
the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential,
200 nM MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) was added to the cell culture
for 30 min, then cells were washed twice and analyzed
by flow cytometry. Cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) release was
assessed using the mouse anti-Cytochrome-c antibody
(BD), followed by PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(BD), as explained elsewhere [49].

Cellular uptake of gold compounds
L-540 cells (2.0 × 105/mL) were seeded in 6 well
plates and treated for 24 hrs with 0.5 µM of compounds
1, 2 and 3. After treatment cells were washed with icecold PBS four times, dry cell pellet digested with 700 µL
of HNO3-HCl (1:3 ) solution for 2 h at 100°C and then
resuspended in 4 mL of milliQ water. The gold analysis
was performed with Agilent 7500 inductively-coupledplasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Results were
expressed as ng/gold/106 cells.

Cell proliferation assay and p53 knockdown
PC3 and MCF-7 cells (2.5 × 103), A2780, A2780cis
(4.0 × 103), A2780CP-16 and lung cancer cells (H460,
A549, H226, H838, H157, H1975, H2122, SKLU1
and H1299) were seeded in 96-well flat-bottomed
microplates (100 μL) and incubated for 24 h (to allow
cell adhesion) before drug testing. The medium was then
removed and replaced with fresh medium containing
the gold(III) complexes (compound 1–9) to be tested at
increasing concentrations (from 0.01 to 100 μM) at 37°C
for 72 h. Each treatment was performed in triplicate.
Cell proliferation was assayed using the MTT assay.
Alternatively, L-540 cells (2.0 × 105/mL) were seeded
in 96-well plates and treated as previously described
[37]. After treatment, cell proliferation was evaluated by
the MTS assay (Promega). IC50 (i.e., the half maximal
inhibitory concentration representing the concentration
of a substance required for 50% in vitro inhibition) IC75
and IC90 values (Supplementary Table S1) were calculated
using the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO,
USA) [47]. Dependence of activity on p53 was assessed in
A2780 cells following p53 knockdown by CRISPR [48].

CONCLUSIONS
Drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a
central problem in oncology. Results in this investigation
have identified members of a new class of gold(III)
compounds as potential candidates for application in
cancer chemotherapy. This is based on the demonstration
that gold(III) compounds are effective in cisplatinresistant, as well as in p53-defective cancers cells of
different tumor types. Moreover, since our compounds
contain a dithiocarbamate group capable of preventing a
reaction with other sulphur-containing proteins, we may
hypothesize a reduced toxicity in vivo. Thus, a gold(III)

502

Oncotarget

drug with an appropriate ligand, such as that presented in
this study, has the potential to be an alternative to platinumbased drugs in cancer treatment. Further preclinical
testing in vitro and in vivo will be essential to define their
mechanism of action, their side effects (toxicity) and to
select potential candidates for clinical activity.
