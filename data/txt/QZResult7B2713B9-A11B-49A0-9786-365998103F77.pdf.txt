ABSTRACT
Background: The mitochondrial accumulation of ATF2 is involved in tumor
suppressor activities via cytochrome c release in melanoma cells. However, the
signaling pathways that connect mitochondrial ATF2 accumulation and cytochrome
c release are not well documented.
Methods: Several melanoma cell lines, B16F10, K1735M2, A375 and A375-R1,
were treated with paclitaxel and vemurafenib to test the function of mitochondrial
ATF2 and its connection to Bim and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1).
Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to investigate the functional interaction
between the involved proteins. VDAC1 oligomerization was evaluated using an EGSbased crosslinking assay.
Results: The expression and migration of ATF2 to the mitochondria accounted
for paclitaxel stimuli and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Mitochondrial ATF2
facilitated Bim stabilization through the inhibition of its degradation by the proteasome,
thereby promoting cytochrome c release and inducing apoptosis in B16F10 and A375
cells. Studies using B16F10 and A375 cells genetically modified for ATF2 indicated that
mitochondrial ATF2 was able to dissociate Bim from the Mcl-1/Bim complex to trigger
VDAC1 oligomerization. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Bim interacts with
VDAC1, and this interaction was remarkably enhanced during apoptosis.
Conclusion: These results reveal that mitochondrial ATF2 is associated with the
induction of apoptosis and BRAF inhibitor resistance through Bim activation, which
might suggest potential novel therapies for the targeted induction of apoptosis in
melanoma therapy.

therapeutic approaches. Vemurafenib, the first highly
selective BRAFV600E inhibitor, elicited unprecedented
success for both response rate and overall survival [2, 3].
However, almost all of the patients eventually developed
drug resistance and relapsed within 6 to 8 months [3].
A critical issue moving forward is to address the molecular
mechanisms underlying the resistance of mutant BRAFexpressing melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibition.

INTRODUCTION
Among human malignancies, melanoma is extremely
aggressive and resistant to treatment [1], and the incidence
of melanoma continues to increase worldwide. BRAF
mutations play a critical role in melanoma oncogenesis and
have thus been shown to be a promising target for molecular

RESULTS

Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a member
of the activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor
superfamily [4, 5], can homodimerize or heterodimerize
with other members of the AP1 family to regulate diverse
cellular functions [6, 7]. Depending on its subcellular
localization, ATF2 can elicit divergent functions of
oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities [4, 8]. The
nuclear localization of ATF2 coincides with poor prognosis
in melanoma patients [4, 9], and the forced expression of
cytoplasmic ATF2 peptides induces apoptosis of melanoma
cells [10]. ATF2 mitochondrial localization is primarily
regulated by PKCε, which enables its mitochondrial
function. Thr52 is a PKCε phosphoacceptor site [4]. In
other tumors, tumor suppressor activity of cytosolic
ATF2 has also been observed [11, 12, 13]. Further studies
have shown that cytoplasmic ATF2 binds to VDAC1 to
regulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP), thereby controlling the release of cytochrome
c and promoting apoptosis [4]. Regarding the mechanism
of MOMP regulation, BH3-only proteins (BH3s), which
contain only a BH3 domain, such as Bim, Puma, and Noxa
regulate the activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax
and Bak to form a mitochondrial outer membrane channel
for cytochrome c release [14, 15, 16, 17]. Resistance
to BRAF inhibitors might involve the suppression of
Bim-mediated apoptosis through the inhibition of Bim
expression [18, 19, 20]. Bim-deficient lymphocytes are
resistant to several apoptotic stimuli, including cytokine
deprivation, Ca2+ ionophores, and Taxol [21, 22].
Evidence has shown that although the affinity
of Bim for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w is high [23, 24],
in response to apoptotic stimuli, Bim may be released
and translocate to the mitochondria to initiate MOMP
[25, 26], which controls the efflux of apoptogenic factors
such as cytochrome c [27]. According to these results,
we speculate that there might be a signaling relationship
between the ATF2 and BH3 proteins, which are involved
in mitochondria-based apoptosis and BRAF inhibitor
resistance in melanoma.
Here, we investigate the role of cytosolic ATF2 in
mitochondrial apoptosis and acquired BRAF inhibitor
resistance and the mechanisms underlying the interaction of
ATF2 with other pro-apoptotic proteins. In the present study,
we characterize the BH3-only protein Bim in the apoptosisinduced increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability
induced by ATF2 in the mitochondria. Our work revealed
that following ATF2 localization in the mitochondria,
Bim is released from Mcl-1 and then activates voltagedependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) for cytochrome c
release. Furthermore, VDAC1 oligomerization is involved
in apoptosis. These studies reveal novel insights into the
mechanisms underlying the function of mitochondrial
ATF2, which might provide mechanistic approaches
to restore the tumor suppressor function of ATF2 and
overcome resistance to BRAF inhibitors and other cytotoxic
agents during melanoma treatment.

Identification of ATF2/Bim involvement in
apoptosis and BRAF inhibitor resistance
We first examined ATF2 localization and performed
apoptosis induction assays in a panel of melanoma cell
lines, including B16F10, K1735M2, A375 and A375-R1
cells. ATF2 was localized to the mitochondria by
paclitaxel and vemurafenib treatment in a time-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B). At the same
time points, all of the tested cell types were sensitive
to apoptosis induction by the same stimuli (Figure 1A,
1B). We also observed ATF2 mitochondrial translocation
in A375 cells but not in the BRAF inhibitor-resistant
A375R cells, which is likely responsible for vemurafenib
resistance (Supplementary Figure S1B). Furthermore,
consistent with previous reports that the ATF2T52A
mutant localized to the cytoplasm and mitochondria
and the ATF2T52E mutant exhibited constitutive nuclear
localization, the localization of ATF2 to the mitochondria
by the exogenous expression of ATF2T52A sensitized
B16F10 and K1735M2 cells to paclitaxel (Figure 1A)
and A375-R1 cells to vemurafenib (Supplementary
Figure S1E). Furthermore, ATF2 depletion by shRNA
caused cells to become resistant to apoptosis induced by
paclitaxel (Figure 1B), suggesting that paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis and the restoration of vemurafenib sensitivity
might act via the mitochondrial localization of ATF2.
We next analyzed the level of the Bcl-2 family of
proteins following cytotoxic stimulation. As shown in
Figure 1C, the expression of Puma, Bid, Bad, and Bax
was initially enhanced (within 12 hrs) and then declined
in B16F10 and K1735M2 cells, with the exception of for
Bid (in both cell lines) and Bax (in B16F10 cells). There
were no significant changes in Bok, Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL expression up to 48 h after paclitaxel treatment. In
contrast, BimEL, BimL, and BimS levels were elevated
by 2- to 5-fold in cells 48 h after paclitaxel treatment.
Notably, coincident with ATF2 translocation, the
expression levels of Bim proteins were elevated as early as
12 h after paclitaxel treatment. Furthermore, we observed
no significant change in Bad, Bid, or Bax expression but
did observe a decrease in Bim levels when ATF2 was
depleted in shATF2-infected B16F10 cells (Figure 1D).
A slight decrease in Puma expression was observed in
shATF2-infected B16F10 cells but not in K1735M2 cells.
Additionally, for Mcl-1, an increase in Mcl-1 protein levels
upon ATF2 down-regulation was detected. Consistent with
this, the mRNA expression of Bim was rapidly (within
12 h) and robustly induced by vemurafenib in A375 cells
but not in A375R cells (Supplementary Figure S2B). We
inferred than Bim might be the predominant effector for
cytotoxic effects and BRAF inhibitor resistance compared
with the other related BH3-only proteins Bid or Puma in
B16F10, K1735M2 and A375R cells.

We next addressed whether there was a causative
mechanism for the concomitant induction of ATF2 and
Bim. Remarkably, when ATF2 was depleted, paclitaxelinduced upregulation of Bim in B16F10 cells was potently
inhibited to minimal levels, whereas the expression of
the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member Mcl-1 was
slightly increased. In contrast, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels
were slightly decreased upon ATF2 depletion (Figure 1D).
Further subcellular fractionation showed that most of the
three Bim isoforms generated by expression of ATF2T52A
were located in the mitochondrial fraction (Figure 1E),
and immunostaining of the cells with Bim-specific
antibodies confirmed the mitochondrial localization of Bim
(Figure 1F). Leptomycin B (LMB), thea nuclear export
inhibitor, whichthat could prevents mitochondrial
accumulation of ATF2, suppressed the mitochondrial
localization of Bim (Figure 1E). In the absence of ATF2, Bim
was diffusely distributed in the cytosol and nuclei of B16F10
cells, which did not change after paclitaxel treatment. This
result suggested that Bim expression was mainly promoted
by mitochondrial ATF2 and was not related to nuclear ATF2.
Notably, the expression of Bim proteins was enhanced as
early as 12 h after paclitaxel treatment, which was coincident
with the release of cytochrome c (Figure 1C, Supplementary
Figure S1F), suggesting that Bim proteins may be critical
for the ATF2-induced apoptotic mitochondrial changes that
commit cells to death.

following cycloheximide treatment, the half-life of Bim protein
was considerably elevated in ATF2T52A-expressing B16F10
cells (Figure 2C). The proteasome inhibitor PS 341 restored
Bim protein levels in ATF2-depleted B16F10 cells (Figure
2D). These results indicate that during paclitaxel treatment,
cytosolic ATF2 may inhibit proteasomal degradation, thereby
leading to Bim accumulation in B16F10, K1735M2 and A375
cells.

Bim mitochondrial localization is required
for ATF2-associated apoptotic changes in the
mitochondria and apoptosis
We next attempted to investigate whether Bim
plays an essential role in the apoptotic changes in the
mitochondria induced by ATF2. Cytotoxic stress reduced
mitochondrial membrane potential, as determined by
alterations in JC-1 dye aggregation, whereas ATF2
depletion did not alter either of the fluorescence signals
(Figure 3A). We further stably knocked down Bim
expression using a commercially available shRNA
specific to all Bim isoforms (Supplementary Figure
S3A). This shBim did not alter the expression of other
Bcl-2 family members (Figure 3B). Bim depletion (Figure
3C) eliminated alterations in the fluorescence signals of
JC-1 induced by paclitaxel treatment. The induction of
apoptosis (Figure 3D, 3E) and cytochrome c release (Figure
3F, Supplementary Figure S3B) were also potently inhibited
by Bim depletion. Consistent with B16F10 cells, in A375
cells, depletion of Bim exhibited consistent effects on
apoptosis and cytochrome c release following vemurafenib
treatment (Figure 3E, Supplementary Figure S3B).
Furthermore, we used ABT-737, a Bcl-2 homology
domain 3 (BH3) mimetic that is thought to act by
displacing Bim from Bcl-2, to restore paclitaxel sensitivity
of ATF2-depleted cells [23, 29]. As expected, introduction
of ABT-737 sensitized cells to paclitaxel treatment
via mitochondrial membrane potential alterations
(Supplementary Figure S3C), even when ATF2 was
depleted. ABT-737 also sensitized ATF2-depleted cells to
paclitaxel treatment-induced cell death to the same extent
as control cells (Supplementary Figure S3D).

Bim is not a direct target gene of ATF2 signaling
in B16F10 and A375 cells
Upregulation of Bim expression could potentially
occur at the level of transcription, translation, and/or protein
stabilization [28]. To test the mechanism of ATF2-mediated
regulation of Bim expression, we pursued the question
of whether Bim is an immediate, early target of ATF2
signaling (by directly upregulating Bim transcription).
Approximately 2-fold (B16F10 cells) and 12-fold (A375
cells) increases in Bim transcript levels were observed after
paclitaxel and vemurafenib treatment (determined by qRTPCR) (Supplementary Figure S2A, Figure S2B), whereas
Bim protein levels (determined by Western blot) increased
by approximately 5-fold (Figure 1C).
Actinomycin D, a known transcriptional inhibitor,
blocked the paclitaxel-induced increase of Bim mRNA levels,
indicating that the increase in Bim transcription levels could
be attributed to a transcriptional increase rather than a change
in mRNA stability (Figure 2B). Importantly, ATF2 depletion
had no significant effect on Bim mRNA induction in B16F10
and A375 cells (Figure 2A). These results indicated that the
half-life of Bim mRNA was not altered by ATF2 depletion,
suggesting that Bim was not transcriptionally upregulated by
ATF2. We next investigated whether ATF2 was able to increase
Bim levels through a post-translational mechanism affecting
Bim protein stability. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that

ATF2 induces mitochondrial VDAC
upregulation and dimerization in a Bimdependent manner
Previous studies have reported that ATF2 promotes
mitochondrial VDAC1 activation and leads to subsequent
cytochrome c release [4]. We next determined VDAC
activation (the dimerization-oligomerization status
of VDAC) in the presence and absence of paclitaxel
in B16F10 and K1735M2 cells. As revealed by an
EGS-based crosslinking assay, several distinct (68-,
99-, and 136-kDa) protein bands were observed that

corresponded to homodimers, trimers, tetramers, and
complexes containing VDAC (Supplementary Figure
S4A). VDAC oligomerization was dramatically elevated
(by as much as 20-fold) upon apoptotic stimuli or in cells
expressing cytosolic ATF2 (Figure 4A). In contrast, there
was no detectable VDAC homodimers or higher-order
oligomerization present in ATF2-depleted cells, even with
paclitaxel treatment (Figure 4A), suggesting that upon the
induction of apoptosis or cytosolic ATF2 localization, the
equilibrium of VDAC monomers and oligomers shifted
toward the oligomeric forms of VDAC.
Interestingly, depletion of Bim, but not of Bad,
almost completely abolished the formation of oligomeric
VDAC (Figure 4B), supporting the hypothesis that Bim

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but not Bad functions with VDAC1 activation. Similar
results were observed in A375 cells (Figure 4C). We
further observed that Bim did not alter the total cellular
content of VDAC1, as revealed by western blots of
proteins not crosslinked with EGS (Supplementary Figure
S4B). There was no formation of oligomeric VDAC1
in A375R cells even upon exposure to vemurafenib
treatment (Figure 4C), suggesting that VDAC1 is critical
for apoptosis in BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells.
ABT-737 was unable to restore the VDAC
oligomerization inhibited by Bim depletion in A375
cells (Figure 4F). We also demonstrated that DIDS,

c release (Figure 4D) and apoptosis in B16F10 cells
(Figure 4G), even upon expression of ATF2T52A (Figure
4E). Additionally, ABT737 showed only a limited or no
ability to overcome the inhibition of apoptosis induced
by DIDS (Figure 4G). These results further suggest that
Bim promotion by ATF2 facilitates VDAC1 activation
for the efflux of cytochrome c and further sensitizes
cells to apoptosis.

addressed whether Bim could directly bind to VDAC1.
As revealed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays
after paclitaxel treatment, the association of Bim with
VDAC1 was increased (Figure 6A, 6B) in B16F10 and
K1735M2 cells. The level of the Bim-VDAC1 complex
detected increased during the course of paclitaxel
treatment, and DIDS was able to disrupt this interaction
(Supplementary Figure S6A).
In ATF2T52A expressing cells, we found increased
accumulation of mitochondrial Bim (Figure 1E), as
well as significantly increased levels of VDAC1 protein
immunoprecipitated with Bim (Supplementary Figure S5A),
suggesting that mitochondrial ATF2 promotes the association
of mitochondrial Bim with VDAC1. This is likely derived
from the increase in Bim in the mitochondria (Figure 1C),
where VDAC1 is localized. The association of other BH3only proteins with VDAC1 was also examined. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S6B, with paclitaxel treatment, no
PUMA and a small amount of NOXA bound to VDAC1,
indicating that the association of Bim and VDAC1 is specific
and physiologically important.

ATF2 promotes the dissociation of Bim from
Mcl-1
We next explored whether mitochondrial
ATF2 directly binds to Bim to facilitate the efflux
of cytochrome c after paclitaxel treatment. First, we
immunoprecipitated Bim-containing protein complexes
from B16F10 and K1735M2 cells in the presence or
absence of paclitaxel and then probed for the indicated
proteins by western blot. As shown in Figure 5A, no
ATF2 was detected in the precipitated complexes,
even following paclitaxel stimulation. Consistent with
this, reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments
indicated that Bim was not detected in the ATF2
immunoprecipitated protein complexes (Figure 5B).
Some Bim was present in the supernatant, which most
likely accounted for paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial
apoptosis (Figure 5B) in B16F10 and K1735M2 cells.
Together, these results suggest that mitochondrial ATF2
does not directly associate with Bim and most likely
activates Bim via indirect mechanisms.
We next addressed whether mitochondrial ATF2
influenced the association or dissociation of Bim with
other binding partners. Immunoprecipitation experiments
were performed to determine the association profile
of Bim in ATF2-expressing B16F10 cells. We found
that following paclitaxel treatment, the association of
Bim with Mcl-1 was more pronounced compared with
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in B16F10 cells (Supplementary Figure
S5A). The Bim/Mcl-1 complex could be disrupted to a
large extent by mitochondrial ATF2 in B16F10 ATF2
T52A
-expressing cells (Supplementary Figure S5A, S5B),
suggesting that ATF2 facilitated Bim release from the
Mcl-1/Bim complex in B16F10 cells. In contrast, Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL remained bound to Bim in these B16F10 cells,
even with conditional mitochondrial ATF2 expression
(Supplementary Figure S5A).

Bim binds to VDAC1 in a manner that depends
on its dissociation from Mcl-1
Based on the above findings, we next explored
the effect of Mcl-1 on the association of VDAC1 and
Bim. Our immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that
following depletion of Mcl-1, more Bim was released in
the supernatant and was not bound to Mcl-1 in B16F10 and
K1735M2 cells (Figure 7A). Additionally, Mcl-1 depletion
promoted the association of Bim with VDAC1, which
was in contrast to the binding of Bim to Mcl-1 (Figure
7B). Moreover, Mcl-1 depletion preceded mitochondrial
apoptosis (Figure 7C). Consistently, Mcl-1 depletioninduced Bim/VDAC1 association (Supplementary Figure
S7A), cytochrome c release (Supplementary Figure S7B)
and mitochondrial cell death (Supplementary Figure S7C)
were prevented by DIDS treatment.
To determine whether Bim/VDAC1 association
and cell death are a consequence of caspase activation,
B16F10 and K1735M2 cells were treated with a pancaspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (100 μM), prior to
paclitaxel and vemurafenib treatment. We observed that
z-VAD-fmk addition prevented caspase activation but
not Bim/VDAC1 association and the generation of Bim.
Because 100 mM of Z-VAD-fmk was sufficient to block
caspase activation, the association of Bim with VDAC1
might be the initial signaling of the mitochondrial
apoptotic event rather than a coincident event or a
consequence of caspase activation (Supplementary
Figure S7D). These results indicate that following
paclitaxel treatment in B16F10 cells, the release of Bim
from Bim/Mcl-1 complexes promotes VDAC1 and Bim
association and then facilitates VDAC1 activation, which
is critical for initiating mitochondrial apoptosis.

ATF2 mitochondrial accumulation promotes the
association of Bim and VDAC1
The essential role of Bim in mitochondrial ATF2associated apoptosis and ATF2-dependent VDAC
activation raised the possibility that ATF2 might promote
the interaction of Bim with VDAC to form mitochondrial
permeabilizing pores for cytochrome c release, which
have been reported in other systems [30]. First, we

with ATF2 and Mcl-1 was detected by reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays. B16F10 cells (left panel) and K1735M2 cells (right panel)
were treated with paclitaxel (100 nM) for 24 h. Bim was immunoprecipitated, and western blot analyses were performed for ATF2, Mcl-1

paclitaxel. Alternatively, ATF2-depleted supernatants were subjected to western blot analysis to determine the proportion of ATF2-bound
and free Bim. Representative figures of multiple experiments are shown.

DISCUSSION

ectopic cytosolic expression of ATF2 restored sensitivity
to vemurafenib in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma
cells, suggesting that BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells
indeed maintain their addiction to the ATF2 pathway. We
also detected activation of Bim by mitochondrial ATF2.
Silencing of Bim in BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells further
confirmed that the acquired resistance involves the BH3only protein Bim [18].
It is well known that Bim is tightly regulated by a
variety of transcriptional as well asand post-translational
control mechanisms [28, 33]. During endoplasmic reticulum
ER(ER) stress, CHOP and C/EBPa cooperate to induce bim
transcription by binding to a site within the first intron. In our
ATF2-expressing cells, we first found that ATF2-induced Bim

To the best of our knowledge, the present
work provides the first evidence that mitochondrial
ATF2 contributes to VDAC1 activation via Bim and
Mcl-1, which account for apoptosis induction and BRAF
inhibitor resistance in several melanoma cell lines. The
present study revealed that various apoptosis-inducing
agents, including paclitaxel and vemurafenib, induce
mitochondrial localization of ATF2, which sensitizes cells
to apoptosis, and was consistent with previous reported
results in melanoma [5] and prostate cancer [8], as well
as in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s diseases [31, 32]. Furthermore, we show that

was immunoprecipitated from paclitaxel-treated (100 nM, 24 h) cells (Left panel: B16F10 cells; Right panel: K1735M2 cells), and western

upregulation does not occur at the transcriptional level. Bim
can be phosphorylated for proteasomal degradation [28, 34,
35], and proteasome-dependent Bim degradation was shown
to be critical for the apoptosis of osteoclasts and fibroblasts
[36, 37]. We confirmed that although ATF2 cannot directly
bind to Bim, ATF2 inhibits Bim proteasomal degradation
and promotes its translocation to the mitochondria. This
also explains the higher mitochondrial cytochrome c
release observed in paclitaxel-treated cells and supports the
importance of the regulation of Bim degradation as a priming
event to sensitize the apoptotic response. The mechanism by
which ATF2 regulates Bim phosphorylation in melanoma
remains to be elucidated.
Previous studies demonstrated that following apoptotic
stimuli, Bim is released from the Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w
complex to trigger mitochondrial apoptotic signaling
events [38, 39, 40]. Here, we revealed that accumulated
mitochondrial ATF2 resulting from paclitaxel treatment led
to the disassociation of Bim from the Bim/Mcl-1 complex.
The observation that immunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2 family proteins from Bim-containing complexes
was not altered by paclitaxel treatment further conforms
the specificity of the Bim and Mcl-1 association, which is

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

consistent with the finding that the Bim/Mcl-1 complex is
critical for apoptosis modulation in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia [41, 42]. Moreover, following ATF2 depletion,
Bim was no longer released from the Mcl-1/Bim complex;
hence, ATF2 specifically displaced Bim from Mcl-1 and then
triggered mitochondrial apoptotic events following apoptotic
stress. A similar mechanism was demonstrated in multiple
myeloma [43] and HeLa cell apoptosis [44]. In addition,
ABT-737, which displaced Bim from Bcl-2, thus functionally
mimicking Bim, restored the sensitivity of ATF2-depleted
B16F10 and K1735M2 cells to paclitaxel, supporting a role
for Bim as a critical apoptotic modulator of mitochondrial
ATF2. Considering this observation, we can infer that the
displacement of Bim might require coordinated paclitaxelmediated pro-death signals to neutralize anti-apoptotic
potential.
It has been accepted that VDAC1 oligomerization
is the general mechanism for MOMP and cytochrome c
release from the intermembrane space, leading to apoptosis
[45, 46]. In contrast, another controversial report [47]
proposed that VDAC1 is not necessary for mitochondrial
permeability channels in embryonic fibroblasts. There
may be both VDAC1-dependent and VDAC1-independent

mechanisms of cytochrome c leakage in different cell types
or in response to different apoptosis-inducing treatments
[48]. In this study, we obtained direct evidence that VDAC1
oligomerization is essential for apoptotic mitochondrial
changes, including cytochrome c release and mitochondrial
membrane potential loss in melanoma cells. Moreover,
vemurafenib exposure led to VDAC1 oligomerization
in the sensitive A375 cell line. In contrast, VDAC1
oligomerization was inhibited in acquired BRAF inhibitorresistant cells and Bim-depleted A375 cells. Therefore,
continued dependence on the Bim/VDAC1 pathway
may be an important contributor to BRAF inhibitorresistant melanoma. Previous reports have suggested
that mitochondrial ATF2 may disrupt the HK1-VDAC1
association for apoptosis induction [4]. Consistently, we
demonstrated here that the opening of mitochondrial
permeability transition pores (loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential) during the onset of ATF2-associated
apoptosis is inhibited by DIDS, a VDAC1 inhibitor. We also
revealed that DIDS significantly inhibits paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis. These results support our model that VDAC1
oligomerization plays a critical role in ATF2-dependent
apoptogenic cytochrome c release and apoptosis.

To completely understand the detailed mechanism
by which ATF2 modulates VDAC1, the elucidation of
the molecular structure of VDAC1 and the dynamics
of its interaction with other proteins in the presence
of ATF2 is essential. Interestingly, we also found that
Bim contributes to ATF2-associated apoptosis through
VDAC1 oligomerization (activation). In living cells, Bim
is localized at microtubules [49, 50], whereas VDAC1
is located in the mitochondria; normally, only a small
amount of Bim interacts with VDAC1. In response to
apoptotic stimulation as well as to the localization of ATF2
to the mitochondria, Bim translocates to the mitochondria.
Indeed, we observed the concomitant association of Bim
with VDAC1 in the mitochondria. Consistent with this,
Bim has been indicated to directly interact with VDAC
in isolated mitochondria and red blood cells. To explore
whether caspase activation is initiated by the Bim-VDAC1
association, we evaluated the Bim-VDAC1 association in
the presence of z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum pan-caspase
inhibitor [51]. We revealed that the association of BimVDAC1 was not inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk. Therefore, the Bim-VDAC1 association
must precede the activation of caspases and may also

precede cytochrome c release, which might lead to caspase
activation.
Taken together, we showed that mitochondrial
ATF2 is involved in the induction of apoptosis and
BRAF inhibitor resistance in some melanoma cell
lines. We further obtained evidence supporting the
novel mechanism that following ATF2 mitochondrial
localization, Bim is released from the Bim/Mcl-1
complex and then translocated to the mitochondria. In
doing so, mitochondrial ATF2 might function as a critical
molecular trigger that drives Bim activation. Moreover,
in the mitochondria, Bim activated VDAC1 and resulted
in the release of cytochrome c. These findings offer new
understanding for the mechanism of ATF2 mitochondrial
localization in apoptosis induction and BRAF resistance of
melanoma. Furthermore, this new signaling pathway could
be a molecular target to develop more effective regimens
to induce cell death in melanoma.

using an anti-VDAC1 polyclonal antibody. For the EGS
control, the quencher was added prior to the crosslinking
agents.

Confocal immunofluorescence assays
Cells from different treatment groups were
incubated with MitoTracker Red (25 nM) for 15 min,
fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies for the
detection of Bim. The primary antibodies were revealed
using either goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated
to Alexa fluor 488 (green) (1:500, diluted in blocking
solution) from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen. After 1 hour
of incubation, the slides were mounted, and the stained
cells were analyzed via fluorescence confocal microscopy
(Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Heidelberg,
Germany), with excitation at 488 nm and emission at
525 nm in 5 non-overlapping fields per experiment.
Quantitative colocalization analysis of confocal images
was performed using the plugin ‘colocalization threshold’
of WCIF ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda,MD) by at least two independent investigators.
The values of Pearson’s and Mander’s coefficients were
calculated using thresholds of the two channels (tM1
and tM2) and reported the overlap of the signals which
represents the degree of colocalization.

Apoptosis assay by annexin V/propidium iodide
staining
Apoptosis was measured by staining with fluoresceinconjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide using the
annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) detection kit (Biovision)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A total of 10,000 cells (within
whole-cell gates) per replica (3 independent experiments)
were subjected to flow cytometry analysis to monitor the
green fluorescence of annexin V and the red fluorescence
of DNA-bound PI via excitation at 488 nm. The raw data
obtained were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar,
OR). The results were normalized to the survival of control
cells that were treated with DMSO or ethanol.

Cytochrome c release assay
Isolated tumor cells (5 × 107) were collected and
assayed with the Cytochrome c Apoptosis Assay Kit
(Cat. #K257–100, Biovision, CA, USA). Briefly, the cells
were homogenized with the cytosol extraction buffer
provided in the kit and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for
30 minutes at 4°C; the pellet contained the mitochondrial
fraction, and the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic
fraction. These fractions were analyzed for cytochrome c
by western blot using the cytochrome c antibody provided
in the kit.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
The half-life of Bim mRNA was determined by
qRT-PCR analysis following actinomycin D treatment.
Total cell RNA was isolated using TRIzol according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was
then reverse transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse
Transcription Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems) and
amplified on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems) with TaqMan gene-specific primers (Applied
Biosystems). The relative amount of RNA for each gene
was expressed after normalization to β-actin. All standards
and samples were tested in triplicate wells, and data were
analyzed using SDS software version 2.3.

Mitochondrial membrane potential detection
The mitochondrial permeability transition was
determined by staining the cells with JC-1 (Molecular
Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) as described. Cells
were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at
a concentration of 1 million cells/ml. Each sample was
incubated with JC-1 for 20 min at 37°C and analyzed
by flow cytometry, with 10,000 events counted for each
sample.

Crosslinking experiments for VDAC1
Target cells were washed after the appropriate
treatment, and the crosslinking reagent EGS (Pierce,
Rockford, IL) was added at a final concentration of 3 mg/
ml in PBS (pH 8.3) for 15 min at 30°C. The crosslinker
was quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a
final concentration of 20 mM. Samples (50 μg) were then
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel

Biotechnology) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, protein A+G Sepharose beads were washed and
pre-incubated with primary antibody for 1 hour at 4°C.
Cells were lysed with CHAPS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 2% CHAPS;
Calbiochem). The beads were incubated in the presence
of 800 μg of protein overnight with constant agitation at
4°C. Bound protein was eluted off the beads by boiling
in sample buffer and was then analyzed by western blot.
