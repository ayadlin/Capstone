Abstract
Vitamin D3 is a promising preventative and therapeutic agent for prostate cancer, but its implementation is
hampered by a lack of understanding about its mechanism of action. Upon treatment with 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3, vitamin D3], the metabolically active form of vitamin D3, adult prostate progenitor/
stem cells (PrP/SC) undergo cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and differentiation to an androgen receptor–positive
luminal epithelial cell fate. Microarray analyses of control- and vitamin D3–treated PrP/SCs revealed global gene
expression signatures consistent with induction of differentiation. Interestingly, one of the most highly
upregulated genes by vitamin D3 was the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1a (IL-1a). Systems biology
analyses supported a central role for IL-1a in the vitamin D3 response in PrP/SCs. siRNA-mediated knockdown
of IL-1a abrogated vitamin D3–induced growth suppression, establishing a requirement for IL-1a in the
antiproliferative effects of vitamin D3 in PrP/SCs. These studies establish a system to study the molecular profile
of PrP/SC differentiation, proliferation, and senescence, and they point to an important new role for IL-1a in
vitamin D3 signaling in PrP/SCs. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5276–86. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second deadliest noncutaneous cancer in US men, accounting for an estimated 32,050 deaths in
2010 (1). The factors that lead to prostate cancer development
and progression are poorly understood. Epidemiologic,
genetic, and epigenetic studies contribute to the idea that
prostate cancer development and progression are associated
with vitamin D3 deficiency. Clinical studies correlating circulating serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and
prostate cancer incidence have been inconclusive (2). However, epidemiologic and laboratory studies collectively point
to a role for 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the
hormonally active form of vitamin D3, in the prevention of
prostate cancer (3). The "vitamin D hypothesis" in its essence
states that vitamin D3 maintains the differentiated phenotype
of prostate cells and that vitamin D3 deficiency allows prostate

cancer to progress to clinical disease stages (4). The mechanistic action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the prostate, however, remains
largely undefined.
1,25(OH)2D3 induces cell-cycle arrest and differentiation in
prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells (5, 6). Upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p21 and/
or p27 is common and is implicated in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated
differentiation of LNCaP and PC-3 cells (7–10). Accumulation
of prostate cells in G1 as a result of p21 and/or p27 upregulation
by 1,25(OH)2D3 may precede 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation (11). In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of
prostate cells is characterized by increased levels of prostatespecific antigen (PSA), kallikrein 2 (Klk2), E-cadherin, and
androgen receptor (AR; refs. 10, 12–14). Pieces of the complex
molecular mechanisms behind 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling in the
cells of the prostate are starting to be identified, and we aim to
add to this growing knowledge.
Recent studies including our own have identified putative
adult prostate stem cells that undergo self-renewal and multilineage differentiation into the epithelial cell types of the
prostate (15–19). The phenotypic attributes in common
between normal stem cells and tumor cells, as well as the
presence in the tumor of mutations in signaling pathways
important for normal stem cell self-renewal, have led to the
hypothesis that normal stem cells may be the target of
mutagenesis leading to tumor formation (20). A major goal
in prostate stem cell biology is to identify genes, pathways, and
networks that control self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Studies in this direction have been hampered by a lack
of suitable models that allow for long-term maintenance of a
stem cell population. Here, we present an in vitro system that
overcomes these barriers and provides a model for studying

Effects of Vitamin D in Prostate Stem Cells

the molecular profile of prostate stem cell differentiation
induced by 1,25(OH)2D3.
In accordance with the prostate cancer stem cell hypothesis,
we believe that the prostate progenitor/stem cell (PrP/SC) is
the most relevant target for chemoprevention. The PrP/SC has
a nearly unlimited replicative capacity, but it can respond
robustly to differentiation cues to enter a stage of limited or
no replicative capacity. Agents that promote PrP/SC differentiation and limit replicative capacity are strong candidates for
the development of a mechanism-based chemoprevention
strategy for prostate cancer (21). We have confirmed the
endogenous expression of 1-a hydroxylase (1aOHase), the
activating enzyme that converts 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3,
in PrP/SCs by reverse transcriptase PCR (Supplementary
Fig. S1), which supports our hypothesis that the PrP/SC is a
suitable model for studying the mechanistic response to vitamin D. We hypothesize that 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates differentiation of PrP/SCs, and we believe that the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3
on the normal stem cell have significant implications for
the functional role of vitamin D3 as a chemopreventative
agent.

Materials and Methods
Culture of mouse PrP/SCs
Adult mouse PrP/SCs were isolated and maintained as
described by Barclay and colleagues (15, 22). Experiments
were carried out between passages 20 and 30.
Antibodies and reagents
Antibodies used were as follows: Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), p21 and p27 (Cell Signaling
Technology), b-actin (Sigma Aldrich), pRb (Pharmingen), and
Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit (Invitrogen).
Reagents used were as follows:25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3
(BIOMOL International). When BIOMOL was integrated into
Enzo Life Sciences, 1,25(OH)2D3 was purchased from Sigma
Aldrich. IL-1a (R&D Systems; www.rndsystems.com).
Generation of Rb knockout PrP/SCs, pRbcre/cre cells,
and Ink4A/Arf-null cells
Ink4A/Arf homozygous-null mice with deletion of exons 2
and 3 and Rb homozygous-floxed mice were from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) Mouse Models of Human Cancer
Consortium (http://emice.nci.nih.gov/). Prostate epithelial
cells from Ink4A/Arf-null and pRbloxP/loxP animals were
harvested as described previously (15, 22). Late passage
pRbloxP/loxP cells were infected with 5,000 plaque forming
units (pfu) of adenovirus Cre recombinase vector (Ad-Cre;
ref. 23) in naked DMEM:Ham's F 12) supplemented with 2
mmol/L MgCl2CaCl2 on a 60-mm dish. After 4 hours, complete
medium was added to the infection medium and refreshed
after 2 days. Seven sequential reinfections were necessary to
generate pRbnull cells, as monitored by immunoblotting.
Isolation of VDR-null mouse prostatic epithelial cells
Animals were bred and mouse prostatic epithelial cells
(MPEC) were isolated as described previously (22). Vitamin

D receptor (VDR) knockout was confirmed using reverse
transcriptase PCR (New England Biolabs).
Flow cytometry
A total of 1  105 cells were treated with vehicle (0.1%
ethanol) or 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for the specified times
(n ¼ 3). Cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and collected
by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 1 PBS, fixed
with 70% cold ethanol, and stored at 4 C for at least 24 hours.
Fixed cells were centrifuged, washed in PBS, and incubated in
0.5 mg/mL ribonuclease A (RNAse A; Sigma) at 37 C for 6
hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in
1 mL of 50 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) solution (0.6%
NP-40 in water), and incubated overnight. Cells were analyzed
using a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson),
which acquired between 10,000 and 20,000 events for each
sample. The results were analyzed using Cell Quest (Becton
Dickinson), and the percent distribution of cells in G0–G1, S,
and G2–M was determined using ModFit LT v.2.0 software
(Verity Software House). Statistical evaluations were determined by ANOVA with post hoc analysis by Scheffe's F test.
Immunoblotting
Procedures for immunoblotting protein lysates from cells
grown in monolayer is described in detail elsewhere (22).
Microarray experiments
A total 1  105 PrP/SCs were grown to 70% confluency in 10cm culture dishes before treatment with vehicle (0.1% ethanol)
or 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 in culture media [detailed in ref.
22; n ¼ 3 or 4]. RNA was isolated at 6 and 48 hours by using the
Chomczynski and Sacchi method (24). The RNA was used to
probe Affymetrix 430A oligonucleotide arrays. The microarray
data are publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus
Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; accession number
GSE18993). The data from all Affymetrix chips were normalized using the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) program (25,
26). Comparative analyses were carried out with tests for P
value and B statistics for determination of significance (27).
Data were further analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis (IPA) program suite (www.ingenuity.com), GenMAPP
2.0 (www.genmapp.org), and DAVID (http://niaid.abcc.ncifcrf.
gov).
Growth assays
Trypan blue exclusion assays were done as described elsewhere (8).
Clonogenic assays
Clonogenic assays were done as described elsewhere (15).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
RNA was isolated in triplicate from PrP/SCs treated with
vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24
hours, quantified and converted to cDNA using reverse
transcriptase, and diluted at a 1:10 ratio in H2O. Quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using Bio-Rad iQ SYBR
green supermix. The results were analyzed using DDCt

Short hairpin RNA targeting
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors were generated as
described by Sui and colleagues (28). The IL-1a target sites
are GGTAGTGAGACCGACCTCATT (shRNA1) and GACTGCCCTCTATGACAGACTT (shRNA2). After infection with
ecotropic virus, single-cell clones were generated using cloning cylinders and the expression of IL-1a protein was evaluated by Western blotting after 24-hour treatments with 100
nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 or 0.1% ethanol. Viral infection efficiency
was validated by positive green fluorescent protein (GFP)
signal encoded by the virus.

ELISA was conducted according to the manufacturer's
instructions in a kit from R&D Systems (catalogue number
MLA00).
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was carried out as described elsewhere (29). Fluorescent signal images were captured using
a Nikon DXM1200F digital camera on a Nikon Eclipse 50i
microscope with an EXFO X-Cite 120 Fluorescence Illumination system.

Results
1,25(OH)2D3 induces cell-cycle arrest and senescence in
PrP/SCs
We first characterized the phenotypic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3
on proliferation and cell-cycle progression in PrP/SCs that
were isolated and maintained in our laboratory (15, 22). Briefly,
we defined a reproducible system for maintaining long-term
culture of adult mouse PrP/SCs isolated from 10-week-old
mice, termed WFU3 cells. A clonal population, WFU3 clone
3 (WFU3 cl.3), exhibited multilineage differentiation and selfrenewal in vivo, and they expressed known progenitor cell
markers Sca1 and CD49f as well as basal cell markers p63 and
cytokeratins 5 and 14. A previous study verified 1,25(OH)2D3mediated growth inhibition of the parental cell line WFU3, but
the mechanism is unknown (31). In this study, we used the
characterized WFU3 cl.3 cells, hereafter called PrP/SCs, to
study the phenotypic and genotypic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3.
PrP/SCs underwent dose-dependent growth inhibition and
clonogenic growth suppression in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 in
trypan blue exclusion assays and clonogenic assays, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). Western blot analysis indicated that
both p21 and p27 were induced by both 100 nmol/L 1,25
(OH)2D3 and 1 mmol/L 25(OH)D3, respectively, compared with
the control (0.1% ethanol; Fig. 1C). These data are consistent
with the 1,25(OH)2D3 response in other cell lines (7, 8).
p21 and p27 impact G1–S cell-cycle progression by inhibiting cyclin E/Cdk-2 kinase activation. A major downstream
target of Cdk-2 that regulates G1 to S progression is pRb.
However, it is becoming increasingly clear that other targets of
Cdk-2, such as proteins involved in replication, are also
important (6). To test the necessity of pRb in the 1,25

(OH)2D3-mediated antiproliferative response, we deleted exon
19 of the pRb locus (15). We previously reported the isolation
and characterization of PrP/SCs from pRbloxP/loxP animals (15,
22). These cells were infected in vitro with adenoviral Cre
recombinase (Ad-Cre) and validated for loss of pRb by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S2). pRbnull PrP/SCs were
robustly growth inhibited by 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 to an
extent similar to that in pRbloxP/loxP PrP/SCs (Fig. 1D). Prostatic epithelial cells isolated from animals with deletion of
exons 2 and 3 of the Ink4AArf locus (p16 and p19 null) were also
robustly growth inhibited by 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3
(Fig. 1D). As a positive control, we isolated MPECs from
littermate-matched VDR wild-type (VDRWT) and VDRnull animals (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 32). We confirmed that the
antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 are VDR dependent in
our system; VDRnull cells were not growth inhibited by 1,25
(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1D).

We next analyzed cell-cycle progression in asynchronously
dividing wild-type (WT) PrP/SCs, pRbloxP/loxP, and pRbnull PrP/
SCs treated with vehicle control or 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3
(Fig. 2A). Cell-cycle distribution was based on PI staining and
was analyzed by flow cytometry. At 24 hours posttreatment, all
3 cell lines showed a significant increase in the G1 phase
fraction, and the WT and pRbloxP/loxP cells showed a significant
decrease in the S-phase fraction. By 48 hours, all 3 cell lines had
significantly reduced the fraction of S-phase cells. However,
only the pRbloxP/loxP cells exhibited a significant increase in the
G1 phase fraction. Interestingly, they also exhibited a significantly greater fraction of cells in the G2–M phase. By 72 hours,
all cell lines showed a significantly greater fraction of cells in
the G2–M phase and significantly fewer cells in S-phase. Taken
together, these data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits global
cell-cycle progression of PrP/SCs by early effects at G1–S,
followed by more delayed effects at G2–M.

We recently discovered that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces senescence of prostate cancer cells (30). To test whether 1,25
(OH)2D3 can also induce senescence of PrP/SCs, we assayed
SA-b-gal activity in PrP/SCs treated with ethanol or 1,25
(OH)2D3. The cells exhibiting SA-b-gal expression have a
flattened, enlarged morphology characteristic of senescence,
which was apparent upon treatment with the doxorubicin
(Dox)-positive control (Fig. 2B). 1,25(OH)2D3 induced senescence in PrP/SCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B), which
likely contributed to the growth-suppressive effects of 1,25
(OH)2D3.
1,25(OH)2D3 induces global gene expression changes in
PrP/SCs
To identify novel targets of VDR transcriptional activity and
to assess global gene expression changes, we probed Affymetrix gene expression arrays with RNA from 100 nmol/L 1,25
(OH)2D3- or ethanol-treated PrP/SCs (Supplementary Fig. S3A
for schema; Gene Expression Omnibus Database accession
number GSE18993). At 6 hours, 263 genes were upregulated

5280

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

and 61 genes were downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 that were
statistically significant relative to the control treatment. At 48
hours, 326 genes were upregulated and 205 genes were downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3, also statistically significant (Supplementary Tables S1–4). The 6-hour time point is more likely
to capture direct transcriptional targets of the VDR in a robust
manner, whereas the 48-hour time point is likely to capture
more secondary and tertiary targets. Supplementary Table S5
summarizes the top 20 up- and downregulated genes in PrP/
SCs treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 6 and 48 hours, respectively.
The most highly upregulated gene at 6 and 48 hours is
Cyp24a1, which encodes 25(OH)D3 24-hydroxylase, the bestdocumented VDR transcriptional target that contributes to
negative feedback of 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling. The similarities
and differences in microarray profiles between 1,25(OH)2D3treated PrP/SCs and other prostate cells, such as RWPE-1
cells, highlights the sensitivity of 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling to
cellular context (33). Annotation of the genes according to
function by the IPA program suite indicated that a number
of the 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genes are associated with the

among the genes upregulated at 48 hours (Supplementary
Table S6).
Consistent with the cell-cycle analysis in Figure 2A, 100
nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 induced global regulation of genes
involved in cell-cycle progression (Fig. 3A). These include
genes encoding proteins important for G1–S progression, such
as cyclin E2, Cks1b, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna),
and multiple members of the E2F family of transcription
factors. There was also the regulation of genes involved in
DNA synthesis and replication fork loading, such as Cdc7,
Orc2l, and Mcm6. Most notably, 1,25(OH)2D3 regulated numerous genes, the corresponding proteins of which directly contribute to or modulate spindle assembly and mitosis (Fig. 3A).
Interestingly, neither p21 nor p27 was present in the gene lists
at 6 hours, which is consistent with other studies in our
laboratory that suggest that these proteins are regulated as
secondary targets of 1,25(OH)2D3 in prostate cells (Supplementary Tables S1–4; refs. 7, 8). Most notable among differentiation targets are AR and prostatic acid phosphatase
(Acpp), which are both increased by 6 hours and exhibit
further increases at 48 hours of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment accord-

ing to qPCR (Supplementary Table S6 and Fig. 3B). AR
signaling is thought to be essential for the antiproliferative
effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in LNCaP cells, although there is no
evidence that AR is a direct transcriptional target of 1,25
(OH)2D3 (34–36). The regulation of numerous differentiation
targets supports the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes
differentiation of PrP/SCs.
We confirmed a sample set of gene targets from the microarray results by qPCR, including AR, prostatic Acpp, Klk26,
keratin 4 (Krt4), prostate stem cell antigen (Psca), stefin A1
(Stfa1), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4), and bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A (Bmpr1a; Fig. 3B). Psca is a
misnomer for this gene/protein; Psca expression in the prostate
stem cell is low, but levels increase when the cell undergoes
differentiation into a transit-amplifying cell (37). The increase in
Psca in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 supports the hypothesis that
1,25(OH)2D3 drives differentiation of the PrP/SC into a transitamplifying cell. The other targets such as AR, Acpp, Krts, and Klks
suggest that the transit-amplifying cell population is progressing
toward a luminal cell phenotype. We believe that this in vitro
differentiation model will allow for in-depth analysis of the
molecular programming behind PrP/SC differentiation.

IL-1a is a novel target for 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling in PrP/
SCs
Our goal was to identify key pathways governing vitamin
D3–mediated effects so that we may better design rational
combinatorial strategies for prostate cancer chemoprevention. Although the array data were informative, it was not clear
which target(s) should be pursued based solely on fold induction; a systems biology approach was needed to make more
informed decisions. To do this, we evaluated the microarray
data using the IPA program suite, which identifies regulated
networks based on signaling pathways, protein–gene and
protein–protein interactions, biological functions, and diseases. Normalized and statistically significant array data were
evaluated by IPA, and networks were generated using protocols provided with the software. Figure 4 shows the topscoring network of annotated genes significantly regulated
by 1,25(OH)2D3 at 6 hours in PrP/SCs. This network was
focused around IL-1a signaling. When the top 8 most regulated networks were merged, IL-1a was centrally located,
which suggests a central role for IL-1a in the gene and protein
interactions in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The Affymetrix array data showed that IL1a was upregulated 6.8-fold at 6 hours and 4.8-fold at 48 hours

previously defined targets of IL-1a signaling such as

time point in the array data, suggesting that these are secondary targets of 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling mediated by IL-1a
(Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S3).
IL-1a is one of a 3-member family of related cytokines that
bind to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) and have roles in inflammation, proliferation, and differentiation (38). IL-1a is synthesized as a 33-kDa pro-IL-1a. The amino-terminal propeptide
contains a nuclear localization sequence sufficient to direct
the 33-kDa form to the nucleus where it is thought to impact
gene expression independently from the membrane-bound IL1R1. The propeptide must be cleaved by calpain in order for
the 17-kDa (mature) form to be tethered to the cell membrane
and/or secreted by a nonclassical mechanism (39, 40). The
effects of IL-1a are cell-type specific, and its potential role in
1,25(OH)2D3 signaling has previously been reported both in
osteoclast differentiation and in modulation of keratinocyte
inflammation (41, 42). Given the cell-specific effects of IL-1a,
its putative role in the nucleus, and the dominant location of
IL-1a in the array data and IPA analysis, we hypothesized that
IL-1a mediates the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in
PrP/SCs.

Effects of Vitamin D in Prostate Stem Cells

Figure 6. IL-1a is located within
the cytosolic and nuclear
compartments of PrP/SCs. The
speckled IL-1a signal (white

EtOH-treated cells and increased

(33 kDa) and mRNA levels within 6 hours, and levels peaked at
24 hours of treatment in PrP/SCs (Fig. 5A and B). We also saw
induction of IL-1a by 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 in additional
PrP/SC strains with different genetic backgrounds (Supplementary Fig. S5). Despite the strong induction of IL-1a by 1,25
(OH)2D3, IL-1a was not secreted into the medium beyond the
minimum detection level at 24 hours, as measured by an
ELISA, whereas at 48 hours, the levels of IL-1a in the medium
reached only 9 pg/mL (Fig. 5C). Because IL-1a secretion was
negligible, we used immunofluorescence to visualize IL-1a
localization. IL-1a appeared to reside in the cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments of PrP/SCs upon treatment with 1,25
(OH)2D3 (Fig. 6). In addition, Western blots did not detect a 17kDa band for the membrane-associated form of IL-1a.
Together, this suggests that IL-1a acts in a primarily intracellular (and not membrane-bound) manner in PrP/SCs,
consistent with arguments for intracrine actions of IL-1a
(38). However, high-dose exogenous IL-1a ((100 ng/mL)
elicited a 40% growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6),
suggesting the potential for receptor-mediated signaling to
contribute to the observed effects.
To evaluate the role of IL-1a in the antiproliferative effects
of 1,25(OH)2D3, we developed shRNA vectors that target IL-1a
and a control vector. We verified by Western blotting that IL1a expression was suppressed by the targeted shRNAs (Fig. 7A
and B). We also verified that shRNA-infected cells maintained
an intact VDR signaling pathway by assessment of Cyp24a1

www.aacrjournals.org

mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S7). Figure 7A and B
show that PrP/SCs infected with control shRNA (shRNA NC)
were significantly growth inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 1,25(OH)2D3 by 48 hours. In contrast, PrP/SC infected
with IL-1a shRNAs were resistant to the antiproliferative
effects of 1,25(OH)2D3. IL-1a suppression alone did not substantially alter PrP/SC proliferation (not shown), which is
unsurprising given the low basal levels of IL-1a in PrP/SCs.
To validate these results, we infected an additional strain of
PrP/SCs from a different genetic background (pRbloxP/loxP)
with control and IL-1a shRNA1 (Supplementary Fig. S8A).
Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 validated our findings that IL-1a
was necessary for the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3
in PrP/SCs (Supplementary Fig. S8B). To test whether IL-1a is
sufficient to restore growth inhibition by 1,25(OH)2D3, we
treated IL-1a shRNA–infected PrP/SCs with a range of dose
combinations of exogenous IL-1a and 1,25(OH)2D3 (Supplementary Fig. S9). IL-1a (10 ng/mL) was sufficient to rescue
1,25(OH)2D3-mediated growth suppression (Fig. 7C). However,
10 pg/mL IL-1a, the approximate concentration secreted from
PrP/SCs upon 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, was not sufficient to
rescue growth inhibition by 1,25(OH)2D3 in IL-1a knockdown
cells, suggesting a primarily intracellular role for IL-1a in 1,25
(OH)2D3 signaling (Fig. 7C).
1,25(OH)2D3, the hormonal form of vitamin D3, is commonly
used in vitro. However, nanomolar doses are superphysiologic.

(Supplementary Fig. S1), which converts 25(OH)D3 to 1,25
(OH)2D3. Physiologically relevant and safe levels of 25(OH)D3
can exceed 100 nmol/L. We treated control and IL-1a knockdown–infected PrP/SCs with physiologically relevant doses of
25(OH)D3 for 24 hours and observed induction of IL-1a in the
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S8C). Furthermore, 25(OH)
D3 induced dose-dependent growth inhibition of control PrP/
SCs and not IL-1a shRNA PrP/SCs (Supplementary Fig. S8D).
This further supports the necessity for IL-1a in the antiproliferative activity of vitamin D3 in PrP/SCs. In addition,
because 25(OH)D3 was sufficient to suppress PrP/SC growth
at doses readily achievable in vivo, it supports the relevance of
vitamin D3 in the chemopreventative setting.

Discussion
Here we explore the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 as a modulator of
prostate stem cell differentiation, proliferation, and senescence, and we present an in vitro model for studying the
molecular program behind these actions. It is unclear whether

5284

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

the induction of senescence is coincident with or in addition
to the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on cell-cycle arrest. The modest
effects of vitamin D3 on the cell-cycle imply that additional
mechanisms are important for overall growth regulation. We
used superphysiologic levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce senescence in vitro, and it will be important to test induction of
senescence by vitamin D3in vivo, given the disparate conditions. Senescence occurs in the prostate as a protective
mechanism against prostate cancer progression (43). However, senescence has not been reported to occur naturally in
the aged adult prostate. The finding that PrP/SCs undergo 1,25
(OH)2D3-induced senescence suggests a possible mechanism
for chemoprevention of prostate cancer by vitamin D3 that
needs to be tested in vivo.
Cancer cells have many phenotypic parallels to stem cells,
and an increasing number of genotypic parallels are being
made as well that have led to the cancer stem cell hypothesis.
These have best been characterized in the hematopoietic stem
cell system, with emphasis on the roles of Wnt, Notch, and
b-catenin signaling (20). Our array data revealed regulation of

Effects of Vitamin D in Prostate Stem Cells

genes involved in these pathways as well as BMP and TGFb
signaling pathways (Supplementary Tables S1–4 and S6).
These networks likely play roles in prostate stem cell maintenance and differentiation, and we are beginning to interrogate the impact of 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling on these pathways.
These experiments will provide insight into normal prostate
development as well as the mechanism behind maintenance
of prostate health by vitamin D, prompting rationale for an
effective chemopreventative regimen.
These studies are among those that support a functional
intersection between hormone and cytokine signaling. We
found that IL-1a is a critical component for vitamin D3
signaling in PrP/SCs. A previous report has shown that IL1a is not detected immunohistochemically in normal prostate
cells in vivo, whereas IL-1a is detected in benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) and in prostate cancer cells (44). However,
IL-1a was detected at the edges of the cell membranes, so it
was perhaps derived from the proinflammatory microenvironment associated with prostate cancer. The roles of endogenous IL-1a and its signaling components in these cell types
are unknown.
This is the first study reporting IL-1a in the normal adult
PrP/SC, notably in response to 1,25(OH)2D3, and we have
shown that IL-1a resides in the cytoplasm and nuclei of these
cells. We have identified a putative vitamin D response element (VDRE) upstream of the IL-1a coding region that aligns

with known consensus VDREs (refs. 45–48; Supplementary
Table S7). Our microarray data also showed that 1,25(OH)2D3
decreased expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and
IL-6, a common downstream target of IL-1a associated with
inflammation in the prostate (ref. 49; Supplementary Tables
S1–4). Together, this leads us to hypothesize that IL-1a
induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 does not act through its transmembrane receptor to promote inflammation in PrP/SCs. The
actions of IL-1a are cell-type specific, and our data support
an antiproliferative, intracellular role for IL-1a in the 1,25
(OH)2D3-induced growth inhibition of PrP/SCs. Overall, this
work provides mechanistic support for the use of vitamin D3
as a chemopreventative agent for prostate cancer.
