BACKGROUND. XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) negatively regulates the function
of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a member of the IAP family
that exerts antiapoptotic effects. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
pathway is thought to increase cell proliferation and to protect cells from apoptosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between the ERK1/
2 signaling pathway and XAF1 in colon cancer.
METHODS. Four human colon cancer cell lines, HCT1116 and Lovo (wildtype
p53), DLD1 and SW1116 (mutant p53), were used. Lovo stable transfectants with
XAF1 sense and antisense were established. The effects of dominant-negative
MEK1 (DN-MEK1) and MEK-specific inhibitor U0126 on the ERK signaling pathway and expression of XAF1 and XIAP proteins were determined. The transcription activity of core XAF1 promoter was assessed by dual luciferase reporter
assay. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined

was more sensitive to U0126-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of
XAF1 by antisense reversed U0126-induced inhibition of cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS. XAF1 expression was up-regulated by inhibition of the ERK1/2
pathway through transcriptional regulation, which required de novo protein synthesis. The results suggest that XAF1 mediates apoptosis induced by the ERK1/2
pathway in colon cancer. Cancer 2007;109:1996–2003.  2007 American Cancer

itogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) comprise a family of
serine/threonine protein kinases that mediate intracellular phosphorylation events linking receptor activation to the control of cell proliferation, chemotaxis, differentiation, and stress response.1 MAPKs are
activated through phosphorylation of a specific threonine and tyrosine by dual specificity MAPK kinases referred to as MEKs. Homologous kinases in several sequential protein kinase cascades have been
identified in yeast, mammalian cells, and plant, indicating conserved
MAPK modules for signal transduction in eukaryotes.2–4 Recently,
2 new groups of protein kinases have been added to the family of
mammalian MAPKs: the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) or

Jun kinases (JNKs) and the second family, the p38 kinases.5 Colon cancer displayed high levels of ERK1/2
phosphorylation.6 Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vitro by a synthetic MEK1/2 inhibitor,
PD184352, decreased soft agar growth and inhibited
the transformed phenotype of colon 26 cells. In vivo,
PD184352 suppressed the growth of mouse and
human colon tumor xenografts.7 Treatment of
HCT116 human colon cancer cells with the specific
mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor U0126 (5–
50 lM) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induction of
apoptosis.8 These results suggest that the inhibition of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation is responsible for at least
part of the induction of apoptosis.
The process of apoptosis is regulated at multiple
levels by several regulatory mechanisms, including the
inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs) family. X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), the best investigated member
of the IAP family, is differentially up-regulated in many
human cancers, including colon cancer.9 Caspase inhibiting activity of XIAP is negatively regulated by
some interacting proteins, including well-characterized
Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2/Omi. XIAP-associated factor
1 (XAF1) is a novel antagonist of XIAP.10 The incubation
of recombinant XIAP with caspase 3 in the absence or
presence of XAF1 demonstrated that XAF1 blocked the
inhibitory activity of XIAP for caspase 3.11
XAF1 was not only implicated as a tumor suppressor, we have also shown that it was involved in the
cellular stress response as well.12 However, its role in
apoptosis of colon cancer cells and its putative correlation with the MAPK pathway have not been investigated. In this study we report that inhibition of ERK1/
2-induced XAF1 expression might be correlated with a
different status of p53 in human colon cancer cells.
XAF1 is essential for U0126-induced apoptosis
through transcriptional regulation.

(Accession Nos. NT010718 and X99699) and we used
the normal genomic DNA isolated from peripheral
blood cells as a template. The XAF1 promoter region
located at 50 -flanking of XAF1 gene13 (F291, from –109
to 1164) was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the following primers: 50 GGGGTACC AGA TCT CCT CCC TCC CTG AA-30 and
50 -TCCGCTCGAG GTC TCC AGC TGC TTG TCC TC-30 .
The fragment was digested by 2 restriction enzymes,
KpnI and XhoI, and inserted into pGL3-basic plasmid
(Promega, Madison, Wis) then confirmed by sequencing analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Establishment of Stable Transfectants of XAF1
in Lovo Cells
Lovo cells were planted into 6-well plates (3 3 105 cells/
well) 18 hours before transfection and transfected with
4 lg/well of empty pcDNA3 plasmid (Lovo/vector),
pcDNA3-XAF1 (Lovo/XAF1), and pcDNA3-XAF1 antisense (Lovo/XAF1-as). All of the plasmids were constructed in our previous study.14 LipofectAMINE 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After transfection for 48 hours
the cells were passaged at 1:15 (volume/volume) and
cultured in medium supplemented with geneticin
(G418) at 1000 lg/mL for 8 weeks. The survival clones
were selected, amplified with XAF1 expression
detected by Western blot analysis, and maintained

Cell Culture
Four human colon cancer cell lines including
HCT1116 and Lovo (both with wild-type p53 gene),
DLD1 and SW1116 (both with mutant p53 gene), were
obtained from the American TypeCulture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, MD). The cells were cultured at
378C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco
BRL, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 100 units/
mL of penicillin, and 100 lg/mL of streptomycin.
Plasmid Construction
The primers were designed according to the genomic
sequence of XAF1 gene obtained from GenBank

Transient Transfection and Dual Luciferase
Reporter Assay
Transient transfection was carried out using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
1 3 105 cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. The cells were incubated until 70%
confluent. Cells in each well were transfected with
0.8 lg of pGL-3 plasmid DNA by 1 lL LipofectAMINE
2000 reagent. The renilla luciferase reporter pRL-CMV
plasmid (Promega) 0.01 lg/well was cotransfected as
an internal control. After transfection for 6 hours, cells
were transferred into normal medium. To inhibit ERK
activation, HCT1116, Lovo, DLD1, and SW1116 cells
were first transfected with pGL3-F291 plasmid for
6 hours, then incubated with 30 lM of U0126 for
24 hours without antibiotics. In another experiment,
the pGL3-F291 plasmid was cotransfected with DNMEK1 or MEK1-active. Finally, the cells were collected
and treated with passive lysis buffer (Promega). The
firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured
using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
with a luminometer (lumat LB 9507; Berthold, Bad
Wildbad, Germany).

experiments.

Western Blot Analysis
Protein (30 lg) extracted from control and treated
cells was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellular member. All target proteins
were immunoblotted by the appropriate primary antibodies: anti-XAF1, anti-XIAP, anti-cleaved caspase-3
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), antiphospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-p44/
42 MAPK, anti-p-MEK1/2 and anti-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass), respectively. Antib-actin antibody (Santa Cruz) probe was as an internal
loading control. Antigen-antibody complexes were
visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences,
Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Reverse Transcriptase-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the colorectal carcinoma cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA
was synthesized using the ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR System kit (Invitrogen). The PCR
primer sequences were: XAF1 (forward) 50 -AAG TCC
TCG CTG GAG TTT CA-30 ; (reverse) 50 -TTT CAG CAG
CTT GAC TTG GA-30 ; XIAP (forward) 50 -CGG TGC TTT

dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (forward) 50 -TGC CTC CTG
CAC CAC CAA CT-30 ; (reverse) 50 -CCC GTT CAG CTC
AGG GAT GA-30 . XAF1 was amplified using 30 cycles
and GAPDH using 28 cycles (948C for 45 seconds,
578C for 30 seconds, 728C for 45 seconds) after normalization to the GAPDH internal control.

Cell Viability Assay
Cells were seeded at 1 3 104 cells/well in 96-well
plates and incubated overnight within 200 lL of culture medium. Cells were then treated with different
concentrations of U0126 for indicated time intervals.
Five mg per mL MTT (Sigma Chemical Company, St.
Louis, Mo) (50 lL, final concentration 1 mg/mL) was
added and incubated for an additional 4 hours at
378C. The supernatant fluid was removed and 200 lL
of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) was added to
each well. A micro enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent
assay (ELISA) reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif) measured the absorbency at the wavelength of 570 nanometers (nm). The results are expressed as percentage
loss of cell viability compared with control.

Apoptosis Assay
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 5
3 104 cells/well for 24 hours and treated with 30 lM
of U0126 for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Then cells were
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and stained with Hoechst 33258. The effect on nuclear
morphology was determined by fluoroscopic microscopy. Apoptotic nuclei were identified by the condensation of nuclear heterochromatin and fragmentation
of the nucleus. Greater than 150 cells per field were
counted and the percentage of apoptotic nuclei was
determined.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with the EXCEL
program (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash).
The Student t-test was used to compare parameters
between the different study groups. Results were expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD). P-values
<.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Inhibition of ERK1/2 Up-Regulated XAF1 Expression in
Colon Cancer Cells
The effect of U0126 was detected in all 4 colon cancer
cell lines (DLD1, HCT1116, Lovo, and SW1116). After
treatment with U0126 (30 lM) for 48 hours the
expression of XAF1 in HCT1116 and Lovo cells was
significantly up-regulated. However, no change was
observed in DLD1 and SW1116 cells (Fig. 1A). Figures
1B and 1C show that U0126 stimulated XAF1 expression in dose- and time-dependent manners in Lovo cells.
To exclude the possibility that U0126 increased
XAF1 expression in an ERK-independent pathway, we
examined the effect of dominant-negative MEK-1
(DN-MEK1) plasmid on XAF1 expression. As shown in
Figure 1D, DN-MEK1 had the similar effect with
U0126 after transient transfection. Inversely, both
U0126 and DN-MEK1 suppressed XIAP expression
slightly. This finding was consistent with the previous
report.15 U0126 or DN-MEK1 significantly inhibited
the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and MEK1/2, but
did not alter the expression of total ERK1/2 and
MEK1/2 proteins (Fig. 1D).
Inhibition of ERK1/2 Up-Regulated XAF1 Expression
Through Transcription Regulation
To determine whether ERK1/2 inhibition induced
XAF1 expression at the transcriptional level, we first
checked the effect of U0126 on the transcription activity of a core promoter of XAF1 gene identified in our
previous publication.13 We transiently transfected
cells with the XAF1 promoter pGL3-F291 followed by

treatment with U0126. The transcriptional activities
were measured by dual luciferase assay. We showed
that U0126 treatment increased the promoter activities by 3.56-fold in HCT1116 cells and 3.09-fold in
Lovo cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, when we cotransfected
cells with pGL3-F291 and MEK1 constructs we
showed that DN-MEK1 caused 1.14-fold and 0.82-fold
increase of promoter activity in HCT1116 and Lovo
cells, respectively. Consistently, MEK1-active caused
63% and 54% reductions of XAF1 promoter activities
in these 2 cell lines, respectively (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggested that inhibition of
ERK1/2 pathway might regulate the transcriptional
activity of XAF1 gene.
Second, we investigated if the induced XAF1
expression required de novo protein synthesis. Emetine is known to be able to block translation and its
effect on protein synthesis is irreversible. In this study
we detected XAF1 expression with treatment with
U0126 alone or in combination with emetine. We
showed that XAF1 expression stimulated by U0126
was completely abrogated by pretreatment with emetine (Fig. 2C).
These findings indicated that ERK1/2 inhibition
induced XAF1 expression through the induction of
novel protein synthesis and the subsequent transcription regulation.

colon cancer cells.16 To further solidify our hypothesis,
we investigated whether ERK1/2 activation has effects
on XAF1 expression or not. Lovo cells were pretreated
with U0126 for 60 minutes and then treated with
rhEGF (20 ng/mL). RT-PCR was performed after
24 hours and Western blot analysis was performed after 48 hours. As shown in Figure 3, EGF alone had no
effect on expressions of either XAF1 and XIAP at both
the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3A,B). EGF activated ERK1/2 characterized by the increasing level of
phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein (Fig. 3B). U0126
inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2
and simulated XAF1 expression as well, even in the
presence of EGF (Fig. 3A and 3B).

Overexpression of XAF1 Rendered Lovo Cells More
Susceptible to U0126-Induced Apoptosis
It has been well established that inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 will eventually induce apoptosis in
human colon cancer cells.8 To check whether XAF1
was involved in this process or not, we first assessed
the effect of U0126 on cell proliferation. Lovo cells sta-

bly expressing XAF1 (Lovo/XAF1) or vector control
(Lovo/vector) were exposed to different doses of
U0126 for different times, followed by evaluation of
cell viabilities. We demonstrated that U0126 resulted
in the loss of cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas the overexpression of XAF1 magnified this effect of U0126 (Fig. 4A). Thirty micromolar
of U0126 inhibited cell proliferation of Lovo/XAF1 by
61.28% (24 hours), 26.88% (48 hours), and 21.43%
(72 hours) compared with 74.61% (24 hours), 55.94%
(48 hours), and 40.23% (72 hours) of that of Lovo/vector, respectively. A significant difference was found between Lovo/XAF1 and Lovo/vector (Fig. 4A) (P < .05).
Conversely, no significant difference was found
between 2 cell lines when a high concentration of
U0126 (60 lM) was used (P ¼ .265), indicating that
even the Lovo/vector cells were susceptible enough to
a high concentration of U0126-induced cell death.
Furthermore, we detected the effect of U0126 on
the activation of a featured apoptotic protein, caspase
3. As shown in Figure 4B, U0126 could induce cleavage of caspase 3 and its effect was amplified by overexpression with XAF1. Also, we showed that U0126
induced typical morphological changes of apoptosis
in Lovo cells characterized by a condensed nucleus,
exhibited after staining with a DNA-binding agent,
Hoechst 33258 (Fig. 4C). Similarly, overexpression
with XAF1 increased U0126-induced apoptosis. The
percentages of apoptotic cells were 27.24% (24 hours,
P ¼ .002), 64.62% (48 hours, P ¼ .003), and 70.26% (72
hours, P ¼ .016) in Lovo/XAF1 compared with 12.66%
(24 hours), 31.58% (48 hours), and 48.25% (72 hours)
of that of Lovo/vector.
These data suggested that overexpression of XAF1
rendered Lovo cells more susceptible to U0126induced apoptosis.

Down-regulation of XAF1 Expression With XAF1
Antisense Rescued Lovo Cells From Apoptosis
Induced by U0126
Finally, we examined if the inhibition of XAF1 could
reverse U0126-induced apoptosis. We established a
stable transfectant of Lovo cells expressing antisense
(Lovo/XAF1-as) of XAF1 and identified by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 5A). We showed that U0126 could not
induce XAF1 expression in XAF1 antisense transfectant
(Fig. 5A); in addition, its effect on suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis were also abrogated
to some extent by XAF1 antisense, as expected (Fig. 5C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we determined that a novel tumor suppressor, XAF1, is negatively correlated with the ERK1/2

XAF1 Mediates Apoptosis/Yu et al.

signal pathway in colon cancer cells. Inhibition of
ERK1/2 stimulated XAF1 expression through indirect
transcription regulation. Furthermore, XAF1 was an
effector in ERK inhibition-induced cell apoptosis. Our
finding implicated XAF1 as a novel target for a combined chemo- and geno-therapy of colon cancer.
Current studies demonstrate that XAF1 is 1 of the
intracellular XIAP-interacting proteins that directly
antagonizes the anti-caspase activity of XIAP. The tissue-expressing profile reveals that XAF1 is expressed
substantially by most of the normal but not malignant
tissues. These findings implied that it was a novel tumor suppressor. Although our previous data indicated
that it was conversely correlated with the stress
response of cancer cells,12 the direct role of XAF1 with
MAPKs has not been reported.
ERK1/2 activation is essential to maintain the
growth and malignant phenotype of cancer cells,
including colon cancer.17,18 It has been reported that
inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation decreased soft
agar growth and inhibited the transformed phenotype
of colon 26 cells in vitro and suppressed the growth of
mouse and human colon tumor xenografts.7 In this
study, our finding that XAF1 negatively correlated
with ERK1/2 activity provided further evidence supporting the notion of XAF1 as a tumor suppressor.
ERK1/2 is the downstream kinase of MEK1 and its
activation requires dominant active MEK1. In our
study, we found that U0126 induced XAF1 expression
significantly. However, to exclude the putative side
effect of this chemical, we specifically suppressed
ERK1/2 by transfection with a dominant-negative
MEK1 construct. This dominant site has been reported
to be crucial in maintenance of MEK1 activity.19 Its
effect on XAF1 expression further substantiates the
direct correlation between XAF1 and ERK1/2.

In our previous study, we identified the transcription starting site of the XAF1 gene to located at 26 nt
by 50 -RACE assay12 and further identified a putative
promoter segment13 that contained 107 base pairs
(bp) (upstream ATG codon) 50 -flanking region of the
XAF1 gene. To determine whether inhibition of ERK1/
2 induced XAF1 expression through transcription reg-

ulation or posttranslation modification, we examined
the effect of U0126 on the transcription activity of this
construct (pGL3-F291). The dual luciferase assay and
the use of the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine
determined that U0126 might induce the synthesis of
some novel transcription factors that up-regulated
XAF1 transcription. However, the direct mechanism
remains to be clarified.
In our study we found that not all colon cancer
cell lines responded to U0126 in the induction of
XAF1 expression. One candidate interpretation was
that the p53 status of these cell lines was different.
The 2 cell lines, HCT1116 and Lovo, which responded
well to U0126 treatment, were both expressing wildtype p53 protein, whereas both DLD1 and SW1116
expressed mutant p53. Our result was consistent with
other reports that U0126 induced cell death only in
p53 wild-type cells, wherever the p53-deficient cells
were not affected by blocking the MEK/MAPK pathway.20 In addition, studies using isogenic colon cancer
cell lines and RNA interference assay revealed that
loss of p53 significantly reduced MAPK phosphorylation and renders cells resistant to U0126 treatment.20
Lee et al.21 reported that the apoptosis-sensitizing and
growth-suppression function of XAF1 was markedly
impeded by blockade of p53 function. However, the
direct evidence concerning the interaction between
XAF1 and p53 remains to be collected.
Inhibition of ERK1/2 has been implicated in inducing cancer cell differentiation.22,23 In agreement, we
and other investigators have identified XAF1 as an
interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene11 and a mediator of
ATRA-induced differentiation of colon cancer.13 Although we did not evaluate the direct role of XAF1 in
U0126-induced cell differentiation, we did find that
XAF1 mediated U0126-induced cell growth suppression and apoptosis. It is well known that differentiation is accompanied by a loss of the capacity to
proliferate.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
demonstrate that inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway
induced the expression of XAF1 through transcription
regulation in colon cancer cells. XAF1 is essential in
U0126-induced apoptosis. Our findings reveal a novel
element in the signal pathway of ERK1/2 in regulating
cancer cell behaviors and provide a potential target
for the combined chemo- and geno-therapy of colon
cancer.
