BACKGROUND: O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a key enzyme in the DNA repair process after alkylating agent action. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation has
been associated with longer survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who
receive alkylating agents. In this study, the authors evaluated the prognostic value of different biomarkers
in recurrent GBM and analyzed the changes in MGMT status between primary tumors and recurrent tumors.
METHODS: Twenty-two patients who had recurrent GBM and who underwent surgery with carmustine
wafer implantation were enrolled prospectively between 2005 and 2007. The authors investigated the
correlation between MGMT silencing in the tumor at recurrence and survival taking into account other
clinically recognized prognostic factors. MGMT status was determined by using methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction analysis, a high-throughput quantitative methylation assay, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, expression analyses of human mutL homolog 1, human mutS homolog 2, and tumor
necrosis factor a-induced protein 3 at recurrence were conducted with regard to their prognostic impact.
RESULTS: The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates after recurrence were

3.6 months and 9.9 months, respectively, and the 6-month PFS rate after recurrence was 27.2%. On
multivariate analysis, only age (P ¼ .04) and MGMT promoter hypermethylation at recurrence, as
determined by MethyLight technology (P ¼ .0012) and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction
(MSP) analysis (P ¼ .004), were correlated with better PFS. On multivariate analysis, only MGMT promoter
hypermethylation at recurrence, as determined by using MethyLight technology (P ¼ .019) and MSP
analysis (P ¼ .046), was associated with better OS. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT methylation status was an
important prognostic factor in patients with recurrent GBM who underwent surgery plus carmustine wafer
implantation; therefore, it was useful in predicting the outcome of GBM therapy at recurrence. Cancer

The

O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase
(MGMT) is a key enzyme in the DNA repair process
after alkylating agents action. O6-guanine alkylating
agents, such as 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1 nitrosourea
(BCNU) and temozolomide (TMZ), exert their cytotoxic effect(s) on tumor cells by alkylating the O6 position of guanine. The suicide DNA repair protein
MGMT reverses the cytotoxic effect of alkylating
agents by removing the methyl or chloroethyl damage
at the O6 position of guanine. In case of MGMT promoter hypermethylation, which leads to low MGMT
expression or altered MGMT protein functions, some
authors have hypothesized that alkylation of the O6
position of guanine may cause the O6-methylguanine
to mispair with thymine, leading to mismatch repair
(MMR)-mediated cell death by inducing apoptosis.
The growing awareness that resistance in human
cancer probably is regulated by the coordinated alteration of molecular pathways suggests that many more
genes may be involved in the development of resistance phenotypes in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
than suggested by the changes described to date for a
limited number of resistance genes.1,2 Resistance of
GBM to alkylating agents, such as carmustine and
TMZ, seems to follow a more complex pattern than
the simple dependence on MGMT levels.2-5 It also
has been demonstrated that some functional alterations of the MMR system (namely, human mutS
homolog 2 [hMSH2] and human mutL homolog 1
[hMLH1]), as well as the expression level of tumor
necrosis factor a-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), a key
regulator of the nuclear factor-jB pathway, are
involved in the primary drug resistance of human malignant gliomas.6-8

Recently, epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene
by promoter methylation has been associated not only
with longer survival in patients with primary GBM but
also with a benefit of combining chemotherapy using
methylating agents with radiotherapy (RT).9 However,
to date, few data are available about the impact of
MGMT status in patients with recurrent GBM.10,11 In
this article, we report on our analysis of MGMT,
hMLH1, hMSH2, and TNFAIP3 status in 22 consecutive patients with recurrent GBM who underwent
surgery and carmustine wafer implantation at the time
of recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tumor Specimens
Twenty-two patients with recurrent GBM who underwent surgery and carmustine wafer implantation were
enrolled prospectively at a single institution (Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Center Timone, Marseille, France) between 2005 and 2007. All
surgeries were performed by 3 senior neurosurgeons
(P.M., S.F., and H.D.). Criteria for inclusion in the
study were 1) age >18 years; 2) recurrent, histologically
confirmed GBM; 3) treatment at recurrence, including
surgery and carmustine wafer implantation (Gliadel;
Eisai Corporation, Woodcliff Lake, NJ); 4) available frozen (at least 50 mg) and paraffin-embedded tissue; 5) absence of 1p 19q deletion; and 6) written inform consent.
Clinicopathologic data were collected, including age,
sex, preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS),
previous treatment, neuroimaging, extent of surgery,
progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival
(OS). Written informed consent was obtained from all

patients for tissue procurement and analysis. The study
was approved by the relevant institutional review board
(University of Aix-Marseille) and ethics committee. The
extent of surgery was considered total (gross total resection [GTR]) if no residual contrast enhancement was
observed on an early (<3 days) postoperative magnetic
resonance imaging scan, subtotal resection (STR) if
<10% residual preoperative contrast enhancement was
observed, and partial resection if >10% residual preoperative contrast enhancement was observed. Before DNA
preparation, a cryosection was obtained from all patients
to confirm that samples contained >50% tumor.
DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was prepared from frozen tissues as
described by the manufacturer (DNA purification kit;
Promega, Lyon, France). DNA was converted by using
the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf Cedex,
France).
MethyLight Technique
Methylation analysis was performed as described previously.12 Briefly, real-time, fluorescence-based polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the Light
Cycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA was amplified using a set of
primers and a fluorescent dye-labeled oligonucleotide
probe, resulting in a semiquantitative methylation analysis.12 For the CpG islands of the 15 investigated gene
regions (GENE), the primers and probes were designed
specifically for methylated DNA. All primer and probe
sequences have been published elsewhere,13 and the performance of the technique has been validated.14 The differences in amounts of input genomic DNA were
normalized by the collagen Type II, alpha 1 gene
(Col2A1). SssI-treated (New England Biolabs, Beverly,
Mass) genomic DNA (Roche Diagnostics) was used as a
standard. The percentage of methylated reference (PMR)
was calculated as follows: The methylated MGMT/
COL2A1 ratio for each sample was taken and divided by
the GENE/COL2A1 ratio of 100% SssI-treated genomic
DNA, and the values were multiplied by 100, resulting in
the PMR. Tumors assessed with this technique were considered methylated if the calculated PMR was different
from zero.

Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain
Reaction
The methylation status of the MGMT gene promoter
(National Center for Biotechnology Information no. AL
355531) was determined by using methylation-specific
PCR (MSP) analysis in all 22 patients (initial and recurrent tumors), as described previously by Esteller et al.15
For studying MGMT promoter status by MSP
analysis, we developed a nested PCR approach as
described previously.16 Primer pairs described in Table
1 were purchased from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise,
France). PCRs were performed in a 50-lL volume.
Samples were subjected to 40 cycles in the LightCycler

(Roche Diagnostics). Cycle parameters generally were
as follows: The initial denaturation step was at 95 C
for 10 minutes; the repeat cycle consisted of denaturation at 95 C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60 C for
30 seconds, and extension at 72 C for 30 seconds for
40 cycles; and the last extension was lengthened to
10 minutes. This first round of PCR generated a PCR
product of 287 base pairs (bp). The second amplification was conducted with the following conditions:
95 C for 10 minutes; then denaturation at 95 C for
15 seconds, annealing at 59 C for 15 seconds, and
extension at 72 C for 15 seconds for 30 cycles; followed by a 10-minute final extension to generate a
methylated product of 81 bp and a unmethylated
product of 93 bp.15
CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (Chemicon International, Hampshire, United Kingdom) and
Human Genomic DNA (Roche Diagnostics) were used as
positive and negative controls of the methylated PCR,
respectively. Controls without DNA were included in
each MSP assay. Samples were analyzed on an Agilent
2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France)
using the DNA 500 reagents kit, including an upper
marker size of 600 bp and a lower marker size of 15 bp.
Samples that yielded patterns equivalent to the positive
control were considered methylated.
Immunohistochemical Analysis
All immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were performed
in fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of initial tumors and
recurrent tumors, and 4-lm sections were obtained in all
cases. All immunochemistry techniques were analyzed by
2 observers (D.F.-B. and B.C.).
O6-Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase

The primary anti-MGMT antibody was clone
MT3.1 (Chemicon International) at a dilution of 1 of
100. Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized and
subjected to antigen retrieval by autoclave at 100 for
40 minutes in ethylene diamine tetracetic acid buffer,
pH 8.0; then, tissue sections were incubated with normal goat serum followed by the primary antibody for
60 minutes. The second-generation Histostain-Plus kit
(Zymed, San Francisco, Calif) was used as the detection system, and Vector Novared (Vector Laboratories,
4786

Burlingame, Calif) was used as the chromogen. Sections were counterstained with Mayer hemalum (Darnstadts, Germany). Sections from human colon
carcinoma tissue were used as a positive control in
each run, and omission of the primary antibody served
as a negative control. Samples that contained <10%
immunoreactive cells were considered negative, whereas
samples that contained >10% immunoreactive cells
were considered positive. We were particularly careful
to count tumor cells only and not vessels or immune
cells that were included in the samples.
Human mutL homolog 1, mutS homolog 2, and
tumor necrosis factor a-induced protein 3

An automated IHC analysis was performed with avidin-biotin-peroxydase complex on the BenchMark XT
system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz) with a
Ventana kit that included 3,30 -diaminobenzidine reagent.
The following antibodies were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol: anti-MLH1 (mouse monoclonal
antibody, clone G168-15; BD Biosciences Pharmingen,
San Jose, Calif; 1:50 dilution), anti-MSH2 (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone FE 11; Zymed; 1:80 dilution), and
anti-TNFAIP3 (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone
59A426l; Abcam, Cambridge, Mass; 1:25 dilution).
For hMLH1 and hMSH2, only nuclear staining was
considered to ensure retention of hMLH1 and hMSH2
protein, and cytoplasmic reactivity was nonspecific.
Tumors were scored with loss of hMLH1 expression or
loss of hMSH2 expression if the neoplastic cells had no
nuclear staining and the adjacent normal cells had
adequate nuclear staining as an internal positive control.
Intestinal sections that had positively stained cells in the
crypts of Lieberkuhn were used as a positive control with
each batch.
For TNFAIP3 immunostaining, only cytoplasmic
staining was considered positive, because the nuclear location of TNFAIP3 is restricted by its interaction with an
inhibitor that sequesters it in the cytoplasm. Tumors were
scored with loss of TNFAIP3 expression if the neoplastic
cells had no cytoplasmic staining.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were expressed as percentages, survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method,

and survival curves were compared by using the log-rank
test. The effect of potential risk factors on progressionfree and overall survival were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were 2-sided,
and the threshold for statistical significance was P ¼ .05.
Associations between qualitative variables were assessed
with the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows
version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between December 2005 and January 2007, 22 adult
patients who had recurrent GBM were enrolled (Table
1). There were 16 men and 6 women. The median age
at recurrence was 59 years. The preoperative KPS was
80 in 18 patients (86.4%). Surgically, GTR was
achieved in 14 patients (63.6%), STR was achieved in
6 patients (27.3%), and partial resection was achieved
in 2 patients (9.1%). First-line treatment included concomitant TMZ and RT according to the protocol
reported by Stupp et al in 14 patients (63.6%);
BCNU, TMZ, and RT in 6 patients (27.3%); and >2
chemotherapy treatments, including at least TMZ, in 2
patients (9.1%).
MGMT status in primary tumors and recurrent
tumors using methylation assays and IHC analysis is summarized in Table 1. IHC was successful in all samples
from which tissue was available, ie, in all 22 primary
tumors and in 20 of 22 recurrent tumors. Methylation
assays were performed successfully in 21 of 22 primary
tumors and in 19 of 22 recurrent tumors. MGMT promoter methylation status and expression were not related
to any clinical variables (age, sex, preoperative KPS),
location, or extent of surgery.
Nuclear hMLH1 staining was positive in 21 of 22
patients at first surgery and in all 22 patients at recurrence.
The median percentage of hMLH1 immunostaining was
65% at first surgery (range, 0%-85%) and 70% at recurrence (range, 10%-90%). Nuclear hMSH2 was positive
in all samples at first and second surgery. The median percentage of hMSH2 immunostaining was 80% at first surgery (range, 60%-90%) and 78% at recurrence (range,
50%-90%).

Survival
The median follow-up was 9.2 months (range, 3.1-28.7
months). At 6 months after the second surgery, 6
patients (27.2%) remained alive and free of recurrence.
The median PFS was 3.6 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 2.4-4.8 months). On univariate analysis
(Table 2), age <60 years (P < .005), KPS 80 (P ¼
.024), GTR-positive status (P ¼ .032), MGMT promoter hypermethylation status determined by MethyLight technology (P < .0001), MSP analysis (P ¼ .003),
and IHC (P ¼ .002) were associated with longer PFS
(Fig. 1). On multivariate analysis (Table 3), only age
<60 years (P ¼ .04) MGMT promoter hypermethylation status determined by MethyLight technology (P ¼
.0012), and MSP analysis (P ¼ .004) were confirmed as
significant, independent prognostic indicators.
At 12 months after the second surgery, 8 patients
(36.4%) remained alive. The median OS was 9.9 months
(95%CI, 6.5-13.2 months). On univariate analysis (Table
2), age <60 years (P < .01), KPS 80 (P ¼ .033), GTRpositive status (P ¼ .037), MGMT promoter hypermethylation determined by MethyLight technology (P ¼
.006), MSP analysis (P ¼ .031), and IHC (P ¼ .013)
were associated with longer OS (Fig. 2). On multivariate
analysis (Table 3), only MGMT promoter hypermethylation determined by MethyLight technology (P ¼ .019)
and MSP analysis (P ¼ .046) were confirmed as significant, independent prognostic indicators.
It is noteworthy that, MGMT promoter hypermethylation at first surgery, as determined by MethyLight technology, was correlated with better PFS (P <
.0001) and better OS (P ¼ .008) after recurrence.
MGMT promoter hypermethylation at first surgery, as
determined by MSP analysis, was correlated only with
better PFS after recurrence (P ¼ .029). MLH1,
hMSH2, and TNFAIP3 status were not correlated with
PFS or OS either at first surgery or at recurrence.
Treatment after second recurrence included a combination of carboplatin and etoposide (10 patients) or,
more recently, a combination of irinotecan and bevacizumab (7 patients), and, in some, cases palliative care (5
patients). However, because of the heterogeneity of these
treatments at the time of second recurrence and the small
size of our cohort, these treatments did not have a significant effect on survival.

Changes in O6-Methylguanine DNA
Methyltransferase Status Between Primary
and Recurrent Tumors
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the evolution of MGMT
status between primary and recurrent tumors. Among
the 6 patients who had methylated MGMT promoter
in their primary tumor assessed by MSP analysis, all
6 had methylated recurrent tumors. When tumors
were assessed with MethyLight technology, in the 6
patients who had MGMT promoter methylation at
first surgery, only 5 had methylated recurrent tumors.
Regarding MGMT expression, MGMT protein levels
were low (<10%) in the primary tumor in 8 patients
but became high in 3 of 8 patients at recurrence. It is
noteworthy that the mean percentage of immunostaining was 30.5% in unmethylated primary tumors and
4788

68.3% in unmethylated recurrent tumors. This difference was statistically significant (P ¼ .023).

Comparison Between Techniques for
Assessing O6-Methylguanine DNA

status using MethyLight technology and MSP analysis
revealed a statistically significant correlation in both primary tumors (P ¼ .0043; j ¼ 0.677) and recurrent
tumors (P ¼ .0039; j ¼ 0.760). There also was a significant correlation between MGMT promoter methylation
status and MGMT expression in primary tumors (P ¼

A recent, prospective, multicenter study that was conducted through a collaboration between the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and
the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that
the addition of TMZ to RT for patients with newly diagnosed GBM resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal toxicity.17
Consequently, combined RT and chemotherapy followed
by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ currently is considered standard adjuvant therapy for these patients. It also
was demonstrated that carmustine wafer implantation
4789

Original Article

after resection in patients with newly diagnosed GBM
increased their survival significantly in a phase 3 trial.18
The survival benefits derived from concomitant TMZ
therapy were correlated with genetic methylation status of
the DNA repair enzyme MGMT.9 Several authors have

assessed the impact of MGMT status on outcome and
response to other alkylating agents like carmustine in
high-grade gliomas with conflicting results.15,19-27
However, to our knowledge, no study has assessed the
potential impact of MGMT methylation status in patients
with recurrent GBM who received treatment with a
biodegradable alkylating agent, namely, carmustine
wafers.
In the current report, we present the results from a
prospective study that included 22 patients with recurrent GBM who underwent surgery and carmustine wafer
implantation at recurrence. Our objectives were to determine the impact of MGMT status and other biomarkers
(hMSH2, hMLH1, TNFAIP3) on survival and to assess
the evolution of MGMT status between first and second
surgery. Different techniques were used to assess
MGMT status and were compared in terms of their
prognosis impact. In this study, we were able to demonstrate the impact of MGMT status at recurrence on subsequent survival and also revealed the increase in
MGMT expression between first and second surgery.
Between the different techniques that we used to evaluate MGMT status, methylation assays seemed to be the
most clinically meaningful.

Although MGMT status has been studied extensively
in newly diagnosed GBM, it has been studied far less
in recurrent GBM.10,11,21,28,29 To our knowledge, the
prognostic value of MGMT status at recurrence has
been reported in only 1 study. Recently, some authors
evaluated the safety and efficacy of the standard 5-day
TMZ regimen in 19 patients with nitrosourea-

pretreated, recurrent GBM in conjunction with an
analysis of the prognostic value of MGMT protein
expression regarding response to TMZ and survival.10
Those authors reported that MGMT protein expression
was a strong and significant prognostic factor for
patients who were treated with TMZ at recurrence.10
In the current study, only MGMT promoter hypermethylation determined with MSP analysis and MethyLight technology was associated independently with
better PFS and better OS in multivariate analysis. It is
worth noting that patient age also was a significant, independent predictor of better PFS. In a recent phase
1 study on recurrent GBM in adults who were treated
with biodegradable carmustine wafers followed by systemic interferon alfa-2b, MGMT status did not correlate with response.11 However, in that study, MGMT
status was assessed only by IHC and microarray gene
profiling, and only 9 patients were included.11 It is
noteworthy that, according to our results, initial
MGMT status (at first surgery) assessed by MSP analyCancer

October 15, 2009

sis and MethyLight technology also was correlated with
PFS after recurrence and with OS after recurrence in
the MethyLight assay. To our knowledge, these findings have not been reported previously and, thus, need
to be validated in other studies. However, it would be
of great help for clinicians to have the ability to predict
the potential efficacy of a local therapy at recurrence
regarding MGMT status at first surgery.
In contrast to other reports,6-8 we did not observe
that TNFAIP3, hMLH1, or hMSH2 expression strongly
predicted prognosis. These potential prognostic markers
should be tested in larger series to be validated.
O6-Methylguanine DNA Methyltransferase
Status in Primary and Recurrent Tumors
Few data are available on changes in MGMT status (as
determined based on levels of either expression or promoter methylation) in primary GBM compared with
recurrent GBM after therapy. In the current study,
4791

Original Article

MGMT status determined by MSP analysis was the same
for primary tumors and recurrent tumors in all samples
that could be assessed successfully. By using MethyLight
technology, 1 of 6 patients (16.6%) who had primary
tumors with MGMT promoter methylation at first surgery had unmethylated recurrent tumors. These findings
were reported previously in 2 other studies in which up to
50% and 66% of methylated primary tumors reportedly
changed to an unmethylated status at recurrence using
MSP analysis and promoter sequencing, respectively.21,28
It is noteworthy that, in 1 of those studies and within the
same population of 10 patients who underwent at least 2
surgeries for recurrent GBM, a change in MGMT status
from unmethylated to methylated was reported in 4 of 7
patients (57.1%) by promoter sequencing and in 2 of 8
patients (25%) using MSP analysis.28 Regarding the
expression levels of MGMT in our population, it also is
noteworthy that >30% of the tumors that initially had
low MGMT expression (<10%) according to IHC had
high MGMT expression at recurrence. Furthermore, even
in tumors with high MGMT expression, the level of
MGMT protein increased significantly from first surgery
to second surgery. These findings are in good agreement
with those from 2 recent studies that used MGMT activity and an MGMT protein expression score in primary
and recurrent glioblastomas.10,29 There are several potential explanations for these changes, including intratumoral
regional variations, modification in the gene expression
pattern during progression, and/or therapy-related effects.
Glioblastomas are known as heterogeneous not only at the
macroscopic and microscopic levels but also at the molecular level,30,31 and IHC markers may be affected by this
heterogeneity.32,33 However, 2 recent studies indicated
that there was relative intratumoral homogeneity of
MGMT promoter hypermethylation determined by MSP
analysis and sequencing.28,34 It has been demonstrated
that the MGMT gene is the subject of regulation on the
transcription factor level. Thus, alkylating agent chemotherapy and RT are able to stimulate the rodent MGMT
gene and the human MGMT promoter, leading to
increased MGMT transcript and protein levels.35-39
Whether or not the MGMT gene can be induced in
human normal and tumor tissue in vivo remains
unknown. In the current study, all patients benefited
from therapy with an alkylating agent after first surgery
with RT (20 of 22 patients) or without RT (2 of 20
4792

patients). These data suggest that, during chemotherapy
with alkylating agents with or without RT, selection may
occur for pre-existing tumor cells that express high levels
of MGMT. Similarly, Wiewrodt et al observed a significant increase in MGMT levels in a population of patients
with recurrent GBM, but only in the subgroup of patients
who benefited from previous therapy with an alkylating
agent and not in the subgroup that received only adjuvant
RT after first surgery.29

Assessment of O6-Methylguanine DNA
Methyltransferase Status
Several methods have been used to determine MGMT
status in glioma tissue, including an MSP assay for
methylation status of the MGMT gene promoter
region,9,15 quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR for
MGMT messenger RNA (mRNA) expression,40 IHC,41
and DNA repair enzymatic activity assays for
MGMT.41,42 However, none of these assays have been
standardized or validated for clinical use, because contradicting results have been reported regarding the correlation between MGMT promoter hypermethylation and
MGMT protein or mRNA expression and its association
with patient survival.19,27,29,40,41,43,44 In the current
study, MGMT status at recurrence, as assessed by the 3
techniques described, was associated with patient survival
(PFS and OS) in univariate analysis, and there was good
correlation between the 3 techniques. In multivariate
analysis, only methylation assays were correlated independently with PFS and OS. The lack of an association
between MGMT promoter methylation and MGMT
expression probably is because of contamination by nonneoplastic cells or variability between observers, as
reported in others studies.24,45 Thus, in the our opinion,
methylation assays remain the more reliable technique
for assessing the prognostic impact of MGMT status.
