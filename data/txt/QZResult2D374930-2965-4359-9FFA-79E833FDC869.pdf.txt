BACKGROUND: Ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) is an important molecule in different types of cancer. The objective of this study
was to evaluate the predictive roles of RRM1 in the survival of patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received
treatment with gemcitabine or nongemcitabine adjuvant therapy. METHODS: In total, 122 patients underwent tumor resection for
pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the authors’ institution from October 1999 to December 2007. Total RNA was isolated from microdissected, paraffin-embedded tumors. RRM1 expression levels were measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (QRT-PCR) and were dichotomized using recursive partitioning analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
overall survival and progression-free survival, and the predictive value of RRM1 expression on survival was examined using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: RRM1 expression did not have significant prognostic value in the entire cohort regarding overall survival (P ¼ .2) or progression-free survival (P ¼ .7). In the subgroup of 44 patients who received adjuvant gemcitabine, patients
who had low RRM1 expression had longer overall survival (median, 47.8 months vs 14.1 months; P ¼ .005) and a trend toward longer
progression-free survival (median not reached vs 12.9 months; P ¼ .06). In contrast, in the subgroup of 35 patients who received nongemcitabine adjuvant therapy, patients who had high RRM1 expression had significantly longer overall survival (median, 41.9 months
vs 19.8 months; P ¼ .01) and progression-free survival (median, 70.0 months vs 11.8 months; P ¼ .04). These results were confirmed in
Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma, low RRM1
expression in the tumor predicted an overall survival benefit of adjuvant gemcitabine; and high RRM1 expression predicted the

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Approximately 40,000
new cases are diagnosed every year, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) is only 4%.1 Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma
often do not have symptoms until their disease reaches an advanced stage. Even for the 15% to 20% patients who have resectable tumors at initial presentation, the 5-year survival rate is only 18% to 24%.2 Many patients die from local recurrence or metastasis. Although adjuvant chemoradiation or chemotherapy with gemcitabine has been established as the standard of care,3
in a significant portion of patients, the disease still recurs. Therefore, identifying predictive markers of response to adjuvant
treatment is essential not only to individualized patient care but also to the stratification of patients in future clinical trials.
It has been demonstrated that the substrate and allosteric regulator binding subunit (M1) of ribonucleotide reductase, RRM1, plays 2 important roles in various types of cancer. First, RRM1 is a cellular target for gemcitabine, which is a
deoxycytidine analog commonly used as a chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors. The inhibition of RRM1 has been
implicated in tumor sensitivity toward gemcitabine in both preclinical and clinical settings. In vitro, RRM1 expression has
been related inversely to gemcitabine sensitivity in various tumor cell lines.4,5 Transfection of gemcitabine-resistant tumor
cells with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) into RRM1 increased their sensitization to gemcitabine.6 Clinically, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that low RRM1 mRNA levels predicted longer OS in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received gemcitabine and cisplatin.7 However, unlike NSCLC, both the prognostic
role and the predictive role of RRM1 in the response to gemcitabine among patients with pancreatic cancer, especially
those have resectable tumors, have been controversial.8-10
Second, RRM1 is a tumor suppressor. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its involvement in the suppression of
cancer cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis.4 Overexpression of RRM1 in mouse inhibited lung tumor formation

and metastasis, presumably through phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-regulated pathways.11 In line with
these findings, high RRM1 expression levels determined
by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry were associated with longer OS and progression-free survival (PFS)
in patients with early stage NSCLC who underwent tumor resection only.12 However, to our knowledge, the
role of RRM1 has not been studied in the setting of nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant therapy for patients
with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
On the basis of the results from our pilot study, we
hypothesized that low expression of RRM1 is predictive of
adjuvant gemcitabine treatment benefit in patients with
resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma, whereas this does
not hold true for nongemcitabine adjuvant therapy. In the
current study, our objective was to determine whether
RRM1 expression correlates with survival in patients with
resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and in those who
received adjuvant gemcitabine or nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective study of 122 patients who underwent surgical resection for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma at a single institution from October 1999 to
December 2007. The inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and pathologic
stage of T1-T3N0-N1M0. Exclusion criteria included
unresectable or metastatic disease, R2 resection, ampullary carcinoma, and indolent pancreatic tumors, such as
mucinous cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma,
and islet cell tumor. The institutional review board at the
Cleveland Clinic approved and monitored this study.
All 122 pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples
were either formalin-fixed (104 patients; 85.2%) or Hollande fixative (18 patients, 14.8%), paraffin-embedded
tissues. We reviewed the tumor-containing hematoxylin
and eosin-stained slides and microdissected the area with
the greatest tumor density (range, 30%-80%). Then, we
isolated total RNA from microdissected tumor samples
with 10-lm tissue sections according to a modified protocol using a high pure RNA paraffin kit (Roche Applied
Sciences, Indianapolis, Ind). After deparaffinization of tissue sections, the pellet was dried at 55 C for 10 minutes
and then suspended in 100 lL lysis buffer, 80 lL proteinase K, and 16 lL 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The mixture was swirled and incubated in a thermomixer at 55 C
and 400 rpm for 3 hours. The RNA samples were quantified by optical density 260/280 readings using a spectro174

photometer, diluted to a concentration of 50 ng/lL, and
stored at 80 C in RNase-free water.
We used a 100-ng RNA sample along with 2 reference genes (hydroxymethylbilane synthase [HMBS] and
ribosomal protein L13A [RPL13A]) in a 1-step, multiplex, quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) assay, which was
performed at Veridex LLC (San Diego, Calif). PCR primers and probes were designed to span an intron to prevent amplification of residual genomic DNA. Their
sequences for RRM1, HMBS, and RPL13A from 50 to 30
were as follows: RRM1 forward, CACATCAGAACACA
CATACGACTTTAA; RRM1 reverse, TTCAAGTTT
CGGACAACGACTTT; RRM1 probe, FAM-AGTTG
GCTGAAGTCAC-MGB; HMBS forward, CCTGC

AAACAGCTCATGA; RPL13A reverse, CCTCTGTGT
ATTTGTCAATTTTCTTCTC; RPL13A probe, FAMCGGAAACAGGCCGAGAA-BHQ. We optimized all
primers and probes to the same amplification efficiency.
Then, we used the ABI 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Frenso, Calif) with a 384-well
block format and a 10 lL reaction volume to conduct
PCR amplifications. The RNA samples, 4 lmol/L of each
primer, and 2.5 lmol/L of each probe were incubated at
48 C for 30 minutes for reverse transcription. This was
followed by Amplitaq activation at 95 C for 10 minutes
and then 40 cycles at 95 C for 15 seconds for denaturing
and at 60 C for 60 seconds for annealing and extension.
We calculated DCt, defined as the difference between the
crossover threshold (Ct) of the target gene and the Ct average of HMBS and RPL13A for each sample.13 In this
study, a larger DCt value indicates lower expression of the
targeted genes.
Statistical analysis for this retrospective study was
primarily descriptive in nature. Thus, we did not perform
any sample size calculation or power estimation. We summarized categorical data as frequency counts and percentages and continuous measures as means, standard
deviations, standard errors, medians, and ranges. All statistical tests were 2-sided. OS was calculated from the date
of tumor resection to the date of death. PFS was calculated
from the date of tumor resection to the date of either disease progression or death. Time-to-event data were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method with surviving
patients censored at the date of last follow-up. Different
groups of patients were evaluated using log-rank tests. We
used Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate
analyses of potential prognostic indicators in a stepwise

into the most homogeneous subgroups with respect to
survival (OS or PFS). Patients were assigned into high and
low RRM1 expression subgroups, which were carried forward into the univariate and multivariate analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical

RESULTS
Prognostic Value of RRM1 in the Entire Cohort
of Patients With Resectable Pancreatic
Adenocarcinoma

In total, 122 patients were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and underwent tumor resection
between October 1999 and December 2007. Overall, 68
patients (55.7%) were men, and the median age at the
time of tumor resection was 65 years (range, 40-93 years),
as indicated in Table 1. The surgical procedures included
a Whipple procedure in 100 patients (82%), distal pancreatectomy in 20 patients (16.4%), subtotal pancreatectomy, and uncinate excision. Thirty-eight patients
(31.1%) had a positive surgical margin. The mean tumor
size (standard deviation) was 3.4  1.5 cm. Both TNM
stage and overall stage were examined. No patient had
metastatic disease. The tumor grade was determined as
well differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly
differentiated. The median number of positive lymph
nodes was 1 (range, 0-21 lymph nodes). The tumors in 57
patients (46.7%) demonstrated lymphovascular invasion,
and the tumors in 77 patients (63.1%) had perineural
invasion. Forty-four patients (36.1%) received adjuvant
gemcitabine treatment or gemcitabine-based regimens,
and 35 patients (28.7%) received nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant therapy. The median follow-up was 14.5
months (range, 0.2-130 months). At the time of last follow-up, 106 patients (86.9%) had died.
RPA identified a cutoff value of 1.13465 for the
association of RRM1 expression with OS and a cutoff
value of 1.952 for the association of RRM1 expression
with PFS. For OS analysis, 96 patients were segregated
into a low RRM1 expression group, and 26 patients were
segregated into a high RRM1 expression group. For PFS
analysis, 37 patients were segregated into a low RRM1

In recursive partitioning analysis of RRM1 expression for OS, low RRM1 expression had a D Ct value 1.13465 (n ¼ 96), and high RRM1 expression had a
DCt value <1.13465 (n ¼ 26). In recursive partitioning analysis of RRM1 expression for PFS, low RRM1 expression had a DCt value 1.952 (n ¼ 37), and high

expression group, and 43 patients were segregated into a
high RRM1 expression group. Among the variables that
were included in univariate analysis, number of positive
lymph nodes, overall stage IIA/I and IIB/I, and perineural
invasion were associated with decreased OS, as indicated
in Table 2. Similarly, the number of positive lymph
nodes, overall stage IIB/I, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and lymph node status were associated
with decreased PFS. Patients who received adjuvant therapy had longer OS (median, 19.0 months vs 7.0 months;
P ¼ .0008) and PFS (median, 15.4 months vs 3.6
months; P < .0001) than patients who underwent surgical
resection only, as depicted in Figure 1. RRM1 expression
was not a prognostic factor for either OS or PFS.
In multivariable analyses (Table 3), adjuvant therapy was associated with both increased OS and increased
PFS. The number of positive lymph nodes was associated
with both decreased OS and decreased PFS.

Next, we performed similar analyses for a subpopulation
of 44 patients who received adjuvant gemcitabine treatment. RPA identified a cutoff value of 2.4778 for the association of RRM1 expression with OS and a cutoff value of
176

2.2479 for the association of RRM1 expression with PFS.
For OS analysis, there were 10 patients in the low RRM1
expression group and 34 patients in the high RRM1 expression group. For PFS analysis, there were 11 patients in the
low RRM1 expression group and 23 patients in the high
RRM1 expression group. In the univariate analysis depicted
in Table 4, high RRM1 expression (HR, 3.3; P ¼ .007),
higher T-classification (T2/T1, T3/T1), and the number
of positive lymph nodes were associated with decreased
OS. Only perineural invasion was associated with
decreased PFS. The high RRM1 expression group had a
trend toward worse PFS (P ¼ .07). Patients who had
tumors with low RRM1 expression had significantly longer
OS than patients who had tumors with high RRM1 expression, as depicted in Figure 1C (median OS, 47.8 months vs
14.1 months; P ¼ .005). Patients who had tumors with
low RRM1 expression had longer PFS than patients who
had tumors with high RRM1 expression (median PFS, not
reached vs 12.9 months; P ¼ .06), although the result was
not statistically significant (Fig. 1D).
The multivariable analyses depicted in Table 3 demonstrated that the number of positive lymph nodes and
perineural invasion were predictors of shorter OS and
shorter PFS, respectively. Low RRM1 expression predicted a benefit from adjuvant gemcitabine with longer
OS (HR, 0.3; P ¼ .01).

decreased PFS. The high RRM1 expression group had
both a favorable OS (HR, 0.4; P ¼ .01) and a favorable
PFS (HR, 0.4; P ¼ .047). Patients who had tumors with
high RRM1 expression had significantly longer OS than
patients who had tumors with low RRM1 expression (median OS, 41.9 months vs 19.8 months; P ¼ .01), as
depicted in Figure 1E. Patients who had tumors with high
RRM1 expression had longer PFS than patients who had
tumors with low RRM1 expression (median PFS, 70.0
months vs 11.8 months; P ¼ .04) (Fig. 1F).
The multivariable analyses illustrated in Table 3
confirmed that high RRM1 expression predicted a benefit
from nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant treatment of
both longer OS (HR, 0.3; P ¼ .005) and longer PFS
(HR, 0.3; P ¼ .02). In addition, the number of positive
lymph nodes was a predictor of worse OS and PFS.
DISCUSSION
Several potential prognostic and predictive factors have
been studied extensively to help guide individualized therapy and to facilitate patient stratification for future clinical trials in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.14 The results
from univariate analyses in the current study of patients
with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma recapitulated
common histopathologic prognostic factors. They were

nodes, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and
adjuvant therapy. These results indicate that the cohort in
the current study is a representative group of patients with
resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and is similar to the
patients reported in previous studies.
Since gemcitabine became the mainstay of therapy
for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma,1 several key
enzymes involved in the transportation and metabolism
of gemcitabine have been studied.9 Although it has been
demonstrated that RRM1 is a prognostic and predictive
marker in patients with NSCLC who received gemcitabine-based therapy,7 neither the prognostic ability nor the
predictive value of RRM1 have been clearly demonstrated
in patients with resected pancreatic cancer or in patients
who received adjuvant gemcitabine. In the study by Giovannetti and coworkers,9 RRM1 expression was stratified
into tertile and two groups by median as the cutoff in 81
patients treated with gemcitabine. However, there were
no significant correlations between RRM1 expression and
survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A later study from
Fujita and coworkers in Japan supported similar conclusion.10 Of 70 patients with resectable disease, including
40 patients who received adjuvant gemcitabine, RRM1
expression had neither prognostic significance nor predictive value. In contrast, Akita and coworkers8 evaluated 68
patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and

demonstrated that patients with high RRM1 protein
expression had significantly longer OS. Among the 28
patients in their study who received adjuvant gemcitabine,
low RRM1 protein expression was associated with better
response and longer OS.
The findings in our study suggest that RRM1 expression determined by QRT-PCR did not appear to be prognostic for the entire cohort of 122 patients with resectable
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, low RRM1 expression predicted an adjuvant gemcitabine benefit of prolonged OS for 44 patients who received this treatment in
the current study. This finding is consistent with the
results reported by Akita et al in 28 patients with resectable stage I and stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The
use of automated quantitative analysis based on immunohistochemistry by Akita et al8 also substantiates our conclusion regarding the value of RRM1 in predicting
response to adjuvant gemcitabine in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Several possible rationales may explain these apparent discrepancies. First, patients with different stages of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma were studied. The studies by
Giovannetti et al9 and Fujita et al10 included patients with
stage III and IV disease. Our study was similar to the study
by Akita et al,8 which involved only patients with stage I
or II disease. The prognosis and natural biology of resectable and unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma are different, as demonstrated in clinical practice.1,2 Therefore,
studies of these 2 different groups of patients were not
expected to yield similar results. Second, genotypic variations between Japanese patients in previous studies8,10
and Caucasian patients in the current study may explain
in part the different results. Recent studies on RRM1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated an
association between several SNPs collectively and gemcitabine toxicities as well as clinical outcomes.15 Third, different quantification methods were used to examine
RRM1 expression. Fujita et al10 used QRT-PCR for RNA
quantification in their study, although they used only 1
reference gene: b-actin. The study by Giovannetti et al9
included frozen biopsy specimens in addition to resection
tissue samples with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the QRT-PCR reference gene. In the
current study, we used QRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded
resection tissues with normalization to 2 reference genes
(RPL13A and HMBS). We also evaluated b-actin as the
reference genes. However, further analyses with the

demonstrated that b-actin was not as stable as the 2 reference genes we used in pancreatic cancer (unpublished
data). Finally, different methods were used to choose the
cutoff value for RRM1 stratification. In the current study,
we used RPA for dichotomization of the RRM1 level. The
same method was used in a previous study.10 Compared
with arbitrary cutoff level selections, such as medians and
tertiles in some of the previous studies,8,9 RPA provides
insights into the data structure and data partitioning
scheme that do not require user-performed calculations.16
With a prespecified plan for statistical analysis in this
study, RPA in a conditional inference framework17
allowed less variable selection bias and reportedly has better sensitivity and specificity18 and is accurate when it
works with time-to-event data.19 In this study,
the significance of these dichotomies also was confirmed
in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.
Our results from patients in this study who received
nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant therapy—mainly
chemoradiation and 5-fluorouracil—demonstrated a different predictive role of RRM1 expression in patients with
resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These findings
indicate that, after surgical resection, to achieve the best
survival, the level of RRM1 expression may be used to
stratify patients to receive either adjuvant gemcitabine for
the low RRM1 expression group (DCt 2.4778) or nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant therapy for the high
RRM1 expression group (DCt < 2.00195). Although this
implication is supported by the role of RRM1 as a tumor
suppressor4 and the previous findings from early stage
NSCLC studies,12 the conclusions should be interpreted
with caution, because this was a retrospective study in a
single institution, and our findings are not immune to
selection bias or information bias. The sample sizes of our
subpopulations for different adjuvant therapies were
relatively small. Also, our results indicate that nongemcitabine-containing adjuvant therapy, such as chemoradiation and 5-fluorouracil, leads to favorable clinical
outcome compared with surgical resection alone.
Although this result is consistent with the previous retrospective studies,20 it falls into the current debate on the
role of radiation therapy in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer brought about by the findings from previous randomized clinical trials.21-23 It is likely that more
evidence will need to be generated to clarify the current
controversy if the patients enrolled in clinical trials are
stratified and treated based on RRM1 expression status.
RPA identifies the best cutoff point at which each
subgroup is more homogeneous with respect to survival.
This type of cutoff point is not equivalent to a biologic

cutoff point, which is clinically meaningful but not usually available. The cutoff points identified by RPA for OS
in both the gemcitabine and nongemcitabine groups
(closer to the median of RRM1 level of DCt ¼ 1.906)
were much lower than the cutoff point for the entire
cohort (DCt ¼ 1.13465) in this study. The lower cutoff
points for both the gemcitabine and nongemcitabine
groups with respect to survival simply means that small
numbers of patients with relatively low RRM1 levels have
a more similar survival within each group. A validation
study should be conducted before the current findings,
including the cutoff points, can be clinically applied.
Alternatively, semiquantitative analysis, such as immunohistochemistry, may be used to stratify RRM1 protein
expression. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated a correlation between RRM1 mRNA levels and protein levels
determined using an automated, quantitative RRM1 protein assay,12 opening the door for the potential application of a semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis
of RRM1 as a simple and easily interpretable tool in clinical practice. However, this approach needs extensive
investigation, optimization, and standardization.
In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that
low RRM1 expression determined by QRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue predicts an OS benefit for patients who receive adjuvant
gemcitabine, whereas high RRM1 expression predicts a
survival benefit for patients who receive nongemcitabinecontaining adjuvant therapy. Further large, prospective
studies are warranted to confirm the current findings and
to provide guidance for individualized therapy.
