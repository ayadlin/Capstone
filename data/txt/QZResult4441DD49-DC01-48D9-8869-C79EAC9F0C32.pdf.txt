Summary

Author Manuscript

Immune-based interventions are promising strategies to achieve long-term cancer-free survival.
Fasting was previously shown to differentially sensitize tumors to chemotherapy while protecting
normal cells, including hematopoietic stem and immune cells, from its toxic side-effects. Here, we
show that the combination of chemotherapy and a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) increases the
levels of bone marrow common lymphoid progenitor cells (CLP) and cytotoxic CD8+ tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), leading to a major delay in breast cancer and melanoma
progression. In breast tumors, this effect is partially mediated by the down-regulation of the stressresponsive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These data indicate that FMD-cycles combined
with chemotherapy can enhance T-cell-dependent targeted killing of cancer cells both by
stimulating the hematopoietic system and by enhancing CD8+-dependent tumor-cytotoxicity.

Introduction
Immune cells act as sentinels that recognize peptides originating from mutated genes and
eliminate malignant and possibly pre-malignant cells (Rock and Shen, 2005). Cancer
immunotherapy exploits this property of the immune system to recognize and eliminate
cancer cells (Vesely et al., 2011; Zitvogel et al., 2008) by triggering the activation of
inherent antitumor T cells (Pardoll, 2012; Wolchok et al., 2013) or through the
reintroduction of engineered T cells into patients (Burns et al., 2010; Maude et al., 2014).
The importance of a healthy immune system is underlined by the fact that
immunosuppressed/immunocompromised subjects are at a higher risk for cancer (Zitvogel et
al., 2006). Moreover, some traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics rely on the cooperation
of the patient's immune system to eliminate cancer cells (Alizadeh et al., 2014; Arinaga et
al., 1986; Bracci et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

The immunosuppressive effect of some standard interventions, including radiotherapy and
chemotherapy (Weinblatt et al., 1985; Weiner and Cohen, 2002), can compromise their
therapeutic efficacy (Balow et al., 1975; Rasmussen and Arvin, 1982). Such therapeutic
inefficacy and tumor resistance can also be caused by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can
suppress the lymphocytic activity through a mechanism mediated by heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1) (Choi et al., 2005; El Andaloussi and Lesniak, 2007). Conversely, some
chemotherapeutics, such as anthracyclines, are known to stimulate the recognition of cancer
cells by the immune system (Arinaga et al., 1986; Casares et al., 2005; Orsini et al., 1977),
which may potentiate the effect of some immune-based therapies.

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that a short-term starvation (STS) can selectively sensitize cancer
cells to chemotherapeutics (differential stress-sensitization; DSS), while simultaneously
protecting normal cells from its side effects (differential stress-resistance; DSR) (Lee et al.,
2012; Raffaghello et al., 2008) via the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway (Lee et
al., 2010). Recently, we also reported that STS promotes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
self-renewal and reverses chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression (Cheng et al., 2014).
Because water only STS is challenging for mice and cancer patients, we have developed a
fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) that is low in calories, protein, and sugar (Brandhorst et al.,
2015). This FMD reduces circulating IGF-1 and glucose, two major factors involved in DSR
and DSS, to levels similar to those observed during STS (Brandhorst et al., 2015). Here, we

tested the effect of FMD in combination with chemotherapy on the immune system, and on
the immunogenicity of cancer cells.

Results
A Fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) alone or in combination with chemotherapy is as effective
as short-term starvation (STS) in reducing tumor progression

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that STS is safe and effective in inducing DSS via IGF-1
signaling (Lee et al., 2012; Raffaghello et al., 2008; Safdie et al., 2009). Here we tested the
efficacy of cycles of the FMD (Brandhorst et al., 2015) in inducing DSS in a syngeneic
murine breast cancer (4T1) model (Figure S1). Four days of FMD feeding were as effective
as two days of STS in retarding tumor growth and reducing circulating IGF-1 in the absence
of chemotherapy (Figures 1A and 1B), and in sensitizing cancer cells to doxorubicin (DXR)
and cyclophosphamide (CP) (Figures 1C, 1D, S2C, and S2D)(Lee et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2010; Raffaghello et al., 2008). Similar effects of the FMD were also observed in a murine
melanoma (B16) model, in which mice were treated with DXR (Figure 1E). The
combination of the FMD and DXR/CP had an additive effect on tumor suppression, causing
a three-fold reduction in tumor volume compared to that observed in ad lib-fed counterparts
(Figures 1C-1E).
FMD in combination with doxorubicin (DXR) promotes accumulation of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor bed

Author Manuscript

STS promotes HSC self-renewal and reverses chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression
(Cheng et al., 2014). As previously reported (Cheng et al., 2014), three cycles of the FMD
also caused a 33% increase in CD8+ circulating lymphocytes (Figure S2A) and a two-fold
increase in common lymphoid progenitor cells (CLP) in the bone marrow (Figures 2A and
S2B). This increase, likely due to HSC regeneration following re-feeding after STS (Cheng
et al., 2014), raises the possibility that the immune system may be involved in mediating
FMD-dependent DSS.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate whether FMD cycles could promote tumor immunogenicity, we measured the
level of TILs after three cycles of FMD+DXR in mice. Only the combination of FMD+DXR
significantly increased the number of CD3+/CD8+ TILs, as determined by both IHC
(Figures 2B and S2E-S2J) and FACS analysis, (Figure 2C-2E) but there were no
significant changes in the number of CD3-/CD8+ cells (Figure S2K). CD3+ cell infiltration
increased after the first FMD cycle (Figure S2E-S2G) whereas CD8+ cell infiltration
increased after the third FMD cycle, only in combination with DXR (Figure S2H-S2J). The
cytotoxic activity of TILs was reflected by increased levels of granzyme-B and apoptosis in
tumor cells, and by reduced tumor size (Figure S3). Similarly, higher levels of CD3+/CD8+
TILs were observed in C57BL/6 mice bearing melanoma (B16) that underwent FMD+DXR
treatment (Figures 1E and 2F).

CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes are key in FMD-mediated differential stress sensitization (DSS) to
chemotherapy
CD3+/CD8+ TILs are tumor-killing effector immune cells, which serve as an indicator of
favorable prognosis (Andre et al., 2013; Issa-Nummer et al., 2013). To test whether
CD3+/CD8+ TILs are required for FMD-induced tumor sensitization, we examined
immunocompromised nude BALB/c mice that are athymic and therefore do not produce T
lymphocytes. In contrast to the results in immunocompetent mice, the FMD was not
effective in reducing tumor progression in nude mice (Figure 3A), and showed no changes
in granzyme-B or cleaved-caspase-3 levels (Figure S4A-S4E). Nonetheless, the FMD
successfully protected nude mice against DXR-dependent and tumor-independent toxicity
(Figure 3B) (Raffaghello et al., 2008), implying that the FMD-induced protection of normal
cells, unlike tumor sensitization, is not affected by T lymphocyte function.

Author Manuscript

To directly test the role of TILs in mediating the FMD-dependent sensitization of tumors to
DXR, we selectively depleted CD8+ T lymphocytes using a neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (αCD8; clone YTS 169.4)(Carmi et al., 2015), or IgG (control) (Figures 3C and
3E). Notably, the depletion of CD8+ circulating cells was also associated with an increase in
the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs)(Figures 3D and 3E). The antibody-dependent
depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes reversed the effects of FMD+DXR on the progression of
grafted breast tumors (Figures 3F and 3G). Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from αCD8
antibody-treated mice caused significantly less cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells in vitro compared to
those from IgG-treated mice (Figure 3H).
These results indicate that activated TILs are important for the FMD-dependent sensitization
of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.

Anthracyclines can increase cancer cell immunogenicity and attract cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTLs) to the tumor (Michaud et al., 2011). To test whether the FMD directly increases
tumor immunogenicity, we cultured breast cancer cells (4T1) in FMD-like conditions
(referred to as STS for in vitro experiments and consisting of reduced glucose/serum) and
DXR prior to grafting them into immunocompetent mice. One week after grafting the preconditioned breast cancer cells, all mice were also grafted with “naïve” breast cancer cells
on the other flank (Figure 3I). Although all mice were “immunized” by grafting the same
number of live pre-conditioned breast cancer cells, DXR and STS+DXR groups did not
develop tumors (Figures 3J and S4F). Consistent with previous studies (Casares et al.,
2005; Inoue et al., 2014), “naïve” tumors on the other flank displayed retarded growth after
4 weeks in mice grafted with cells pre-cultured with DXR (Figure 3K). Notably, STSpreconditioning alone was more effective than STS+DXR, possibly because the less severe
apoptotic effects of the STS allowed the immunogenic cancer cells to live longer and
therefore provide a prolonged immunogenic stimuli after grafting in mice (Figures 3J, 3K,
and S4F).
Collectively, these results indicate that FMD (i.e. STS in vitro) increased DXR-dependent
tumor immunogenicity and expanded the pool of CD8+ TILs needed to effectively target
tumors.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a mediator of FMD/STS-dependent Differential Stress
Sensitization (DSS)

Author Manuscript

We performed microarray analysis to identify STS-dependent effects on the differential
expression in normal and cancer cells of genes that may be relevant to TIL-dependent
toxicity, and identified the inducible stress-responsive protein HO-1 as a potential candidate
(Figure S5A). Thereafter, we confirmed that both STS and FMD reduced the expression of
HO-1 in the grafted breast tumors (Figure 4A). On the contrary, STS differentially increased
HO-1 expression in normal tissues (Figure 4A). Notably, the expression of Nrf2, an
upstream regulator of HO-1, was also differentially reduced in the grafted breast tumors
following STS (Figure S5B). Similar effects on HO-1 expression were also observed in
vitro (Figures 4B, S5C, and S5D), specifically in the nucleus (Figure S5E). In fact, cancer
cells have been reported to show increased levels of nuclear HO-1 independent of its
enzymatic activity (Hsu et al., 2015).
To test the role of HO-1 in FMD-mediated DSS, we cultured 4T1 cancer cells in normal or
FMD-like conditions (referred to as STS for in vitro experiments and consisting of reduced
glucose/serum) and exposed them to the HO-1 activator hemin or its inhibitor zinc
protoporphyrin (ZnPP) in the presence of CP or DXR. The induction of HO-1 using hemin
(Figures 4C, 4E, and S5F) or its overexpression by stably transfecting a pHO-1 construct
(Suliman et al., 2007)(Figures S5G and S5H) in breast cancer cells (4T1) partially reversed
the STS-induced sensitization to DXR and CP in vitro (Figures 4D and 4F). Conversely, the
HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP sensitized breast cancer cells (4T1) to CP under normal conditions in
vitro (Figure 4G). Thus, the down-regulation of HO-1 is important for FMD-dependent
DSS.

Down-regulation of HO-1 in the tumor by FMD/STS is necessary for the decrease of Tregs
and for the immune-dependent targeting of cancer cells

Author Manuscript

HO-1 is known to confer protection against oxidative damage and apoptosis (Chen et al.,
2004), promote tumor progression (Hirai et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011; Metz et al., 2010),
and have immuno-modulatory roles that affect various T cell subpopulations including Tregs
(Brusko et al., 2005; Xia et al., 2008). In mice, ZnPP (40 mg/kg/day; IP) treatment was as
effective as STS in retarding breast tumor progression (4T1) (Figure 5A). In agreement with
the in vitro results, concurrent hemin treatment (30 mg/kg/day; IP) reversed STS-induced
retardation of breast tumors (4T1) whereas hemin alone did not show significant responses
(Figure 5B). Both the induction and overexpression of HO-1 (by hemin or stable
transfection, respectively), and the CD8+ CTL depletion reversed the FMD-induced (i)
sensitization of breast tumors (4T1) to DXR (Figures 5C, 5D, and 6A) and (ii)
accumulation of CD3+/CD8+ TILs (Figures 6B and 6D). Interestingly, HO-1 induction/
over-expression also increased CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ Tregs and, to a much smaller extent,
CD3+/CD8+/CD25+ Tregs in the tumor (Figures 6C, 6D, and S5K). Similar effects were
observed after CP treatment (Figure S6). As expected, CD8+ CTL depletion alone was not
associated with increased levels of tumor-associated Tregs (Figure 6C). In mammalian cells,
HO-1 is a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the degradation of heme to produce carbon
monoxide (CO), free iron, and biliverdin (Maines, 1988). Biliverdin can have antioxidative
effects (Abraham and Kappas, 2008; Otterbein et al., 2000), but its treatment alone was not

sufficient to reverse the FMD-dependent DSS (Figures S5I and S5J), suggesting a more
complex involvement of the HO-1 pathway. Because HO-1-dependent increase of CO has
been shown to interfere with angiogenesis (Ahmad et al., 2015), metastasis (Tertil et al.,
2015), and tumor growth (Wegiel et al., 2013) it will be important to further study the
potential role of CO in the antitumor effects of the FMD.
These results indicate that reduced HO-1 expression in tumors mediates, in part, the
anticancer effect of FMD by increasing CD8+ TIL-dependent cytotoxicity, which may be
facilitated by down-regulation of Tregs.

Discussion
We provide evidence that the FMD-dependent DSS is, in part, mediated by CD8+ TILdependent killing of cancer cells, associated with an increase in lymphoid progenitor cells.

Immunological approaches are among the most promising treatments with the potential to
result in cancer free survival. However, immunotherapies are expensive and often effective
only in a subset of patients. Here we show that fasting can be substituted with a low calorie
and protein FMD which provides high nourishment and is effective in inducing the targeted
killing of cancer cells. The efficacy of the FMD can be enhanced when administered in
combination with various chemotherapeutics. The efficacy of fasting in inducing DSS both
in in vitro and in vivo models has been extensively reported in the recent years and has been
proposed to be mediated, in part, by the reduction of circulating IGF-1 and glucose levels
(Lee et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2010; Raffaghello et al., 2008). Our study shows that T cells
play a key role in the killing of breast cancer cells during FMD/STS. Another important
component of the antitumor activity triggered by FMD/STS appears to be its effect on the
repopulation of the bone marrow with CLPs (Cheng et al., 2014). Our work extended from
the systemic benefits of the FMD on the immune system to those promoting a targeted
killing of cancer cells. Because of the strong association between the presence of CD3+/
CD8+ TILs in the tumor bed and positive outcome of the cancer treatment (Andre et al.,
2013; Issa-Nummer et al., 2013), our results are of potential therapeutic relevance as they
show the efficacy of a safe and inexpensive regimen in improving the efficacy of cancer
therapy by stimulating T cell-dependent cytotoxicity. Notably, FMD and STS are likely to
contribute to the killing of cancer cells both by immune-dependent and immune-independent
mechanisms, although the effects on 4T1 cells appear to be mostly dependent on the activity
of T cells.

HO-1 expression, which is often elevated in tumors, has been shown to be involved in the
pathogenesis of several types of cancers (Liu et al., 2004). Here, we show that FMD/STS
causes a reduction in HO-1 expression in cancer but not in normal cells. Thus, under FMD
conditions, cancer but not normal cells are sensitized to chemotherapy, in part by differential
regulation of HO-1. Moreover, HO-1 down-regulation in cancer cells can void their ability to
activate Tregs and overcome in situ immunoattack (Otterbein et al., 2000). In agreement
with an involvement of Tregs in HO-1-dependent regulation of DSS, the activation of HO-1
in mice rendered the FMD ineffective in inducing an immune-based attack of cancer cells,

while its pharmacological inhibition was sufficient to reduce tumor progression in the
absence of an FMD treatment.
Taken together, these results indicate that FMD can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by
enhancing tumor immunogenicity, in part by an HO-1-dependent mechanism, which
promotes the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to the tumor bed and reduces tumorassociated Tregs (Figure 7). Thus, FMD cycles have potential of clinical application based
on the enhancement of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to cancer cells in the presence or
absence of chemotherapy, but may also increase the efficacy of antibodies or other
immunological strategies being developed for the treatment of a wide variety of tumors.

Experimental Procedures
Animals

Author Manuscript

12-week old BALB/c (wild type) and BALB/c-nude mice were purchased from Simonsen
Laboratories (USA) or from Envigo (USA). 12-week old C57BL/6 female mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc (USA). The animals were
housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with 12h day/light cycles. All the
experiments were performed according to procedures approved by USC's Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Diet

Author Manuscript

Mice were maintained on irradiated TD.7912 rodent chow (Harlan Teklad). In brief, this diet
contains 3.75 kcal/g of digestible energy with calories supplied by protein, carbohydrate and
fat in a percent ratio of 25: 58: 17. Food was provided ad lib. On average, mice in the control
group consumed 14.9 kcal/day (or 3.9 g/day). Our experimental FMD diet is based on a
nutritional screen that identified ingredients allowing high nourishment during periods of
low calorie consumption (Brandhorst et al., 2013). Prior to supplying the FMD diet, animals
were transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on residual chow and coprophagy. The
FMD diet consists of two different components designated as day 1 diet and day 2-4 diet that
were fed in this order respectively. The day 1 diet contains 1.88 kcal/g and was designed to
adapt the mouse to a period of low caloric intake during the subsequent feeding days. The
day 2-4 diet is identical on all feeding days and contains 0.36 kcal/g. The day 1 and day 2-4
diets were fed as the average intake (~4 g) of the ad lib fed control group every two weeks.
Due to the different caloric densities of the supplied FMD diet, mice in this cohort had a
~50% reduction in consumed calories on day 1 and consumed 9.7% of the control cohort on
days 2 to 4. Mice consumed all the supplied food on each day of the FMD regimen and
showed no signs of food aversion. After the end of the day 2-4 diet, we supplied TD.7912
chow ad lib for 10 days before starting another FMD cycle.

Cancer cell lines and tumor cell injection

Author Manuscript

MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma (gift from Amy Lee – University of Southern
California), 4T1-luc murine breast cancer (SibTech, Inc.) and B16 murine melanoma (gift
from Noah Craft, UCLA) cell lines were cultured in high glucose (4.5g/L) Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.) at 37°C and 5% CO 2. To establish a subcutaneous cancer mouse model, we injected
female BALB/c mice or female C57BL/6 mice with 4T1 breast cancer cells or B16
melanoma cells, respectively. Before injection, cells in log phase of growth were harvested
and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and 100 μl (2 × 105
cells per mouse) were injected subcutaneously in the flank. Body weight was determined
periodically, and tumor size was measured with a digital vernier caliper. Tumor volume was
calculated with the following equation: tumor volume (mm3) = (length × width x height) / 2,
where the height, length and width are in millimeters.
Immunization with in vitro pre-conditioned cancer cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

4T1-luc murine breast cancer cells (SibTech, Inc.) were pre-treated in vitro by 48h culture in
normal conditions (2.0 g/L glucose supplemented with 10% FBS) or “fasting-mimicking
conditions” (i.e. STS; 0.5 g/L glucose supplemented with 1% FBS) at 37°C and 5% CO2.
For those cells undergoing doxorubicin pre-conditioning, the drug was added to the medium
to a final concentration of 5μM for the 24h preceding the tumor implantation. To induce a
“tumor vaccination”, the in vitro pre-conditioned cells were injected subcutaneously into the
left flank of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice. In the specific, cancer cells pre-conditioned
with normal and “fasting-mimicking” medium were inoculated in ad lib and FMD mice
respectively. Cells pre-treated in vitro with DXR under the same conditions described above
were injected in mice belonging to the DXR and FMD+DXR groups. One week after the
implantation of pre-treated 4T1 tumor cells, the mice were subject to implantation of
untreated 4T1 cells in the right flank. Before injection, cells in log phase of growth were
harvested, analyzed with trypan blue staining and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) at 2 × 106 living cells/ml, then 100 μl (2 × 105 cells per mouse) were injected
subcutaneously in the mouse. It is important to clarify that for this specific experiment, all
the mice were ad lib fed for the whole time and the only difference between one group and
the other was the different pre-conditioning of the cancer cells inoculated. All cells were
grown to 70% confluency and only live cells, determined by trypan blue exclusion, were
used for subcutaneous grafting. Equal number of live cells was injected into each mouse.
Generation of pHO-1 4T1 cells
4T1-luc murine breast cancer (SibTech, Inc.) cells were transfected with HO-1 plasmid
(Suliman et al., 2007), or its parental empty vector, DNA using Lipofectamine 3000.
Following incubation at 37°C for 48h, the transfected cells were incubated in selection
medium containing G418. The selection step was carried on for 7 days and the selecting
medium was replaced 48h. Upon seeding, single colonies were grown, selected and the

Statistical Analyses
ImageJ software was used for the quantification of the signal and GraphPad Prism v5.0c was
used for the graphic representation and statistical analysis of the data. The significance of
the differences between groups in mouse experiments was determined by using Analysis Of
Variance (ANOVA) analysis in GraphPad Prism v5.0c. Tukey test was used in the post
analysis and the differences were considered significant if the p value was ≤0.05.
Comparisons between groups were done with Student's t test using GraphPad Prism v.5.0c.
All the statistical analyses were two-sided and p values ≤0.05 were considered significant.

Significance
Cancer immunotherapy is a promising intervention for the targeted killing of tumor cells.
However, tumor-localized immunosuppression induced by cancer cells
(immunoresistance) often leads to limited T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover,
chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced immunosuppression can further reduce the
efficacy of immune-based treatments. Here we show that a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)
increases the levels of common lymphoid progenitor cells (CLPs) and of circulating
CD8+ lymphocytes. The combination of the FMD and doxorubicin increased the number
of cytotoxic CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The FMD-induced recruitment
of TILs was mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and was significantly correlated with
a lower number of regulatory T cells in the tumor bed. Thus, the FMD is a promising
intervention to potentiate immune-based and standard cancer therapies.

Figure 7. A model of FMD-dependent DSS in tumors

Author Manuscript

Two scenarios describing the rearrangement of tumor and immune system under different
dietary interventions are shown. FMD+DXR increases the immunogenicity of tumors in an
HO-1-dependent manner, and increases the recruitment of CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic
lymphocytes to the tumor bed (TILs), leading to the targeted attack of cancer cells. Such
increase of CD3+/CD8+ TILs is accompanied by the reduction of CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ Tregs
in the tumor bed. The latter scenario is also associated with an increase of CLP in the bone
marrow and of circulating CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Dendritic cells (DC) can
recognize DXR-induced apoptotic tumor cells stimulate circulating CD3+/CD8+ CTLs,
which, in our model, can be augmented by FMD cycles.
