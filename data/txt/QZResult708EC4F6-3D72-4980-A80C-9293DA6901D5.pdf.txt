ABSTRACT
Combination therapy, a treatment modality that combines two or more
therapeutic agents, is a cornerstone of cancer therapy. The amalgamation of anticancer drugs enhances efficacy compared to the mono-therapy approach because
it targets key pathways in a characteristically synergistic or an additive manner.
This approach potentially reduces drug resistance, while simultaneously providing
therapeutic anti-cancer benefits, such as reducing tumour growth and metastatic
potential, arresting mitotically active cells, reducing cancer stem cell populations,
and inducing apoptosis. The 5-year survival rates for most metastatic cancers
are still quite low, and the process of developing a new anti-cancer drug is costly
and extremely time-consuming. Therefore, new strategies that target the survival
pathways that provide efficient and effective results at an affordable cost are being
considered. One such approach incorporates repurposing therapeutic agents initially
used for the treatment of different diseases other than cancer. This approach is
effective primarily when the FDA-approved agent targets similar pathways found
in cancer. Because one of the drugs used in combination therapy is already FDAapproved, overall costs of combination therapy research are reduced. This increases
cost efficiency of therapy, thereby benefiting the “medically underserved”. In addition,
an approach that combines repurposed pharmaceutical agents with other therapeutics
has shown promising results in mitigating tumour burden. In this systematic review,
we discuss important pathways commonly targeted in cancer therapy. Furthermore,
we also review important repurposed or primary anti-cancer agents that have gained
popularity in clinical trials and research since 2012.

for common pediatric and adult cancer subtypes in the
North America are 65-95% and 14-56% respectively,
which are still quite low [1, 2]. Cancer remains the
leading cause of childhood deaths in the United States,
and the economic and financial burden for cancer
research is increasing [3]. Age-standard cancer mortality
rates for all types of malignancies have decreased, but
newer drugs only contribute to a small percentage of

this improvement [4]. This is primarily because the
development of new pharmaceutical anti-cancer agents
is laborious and expensive, requiring initial in vitro
and in vivo experimentation, and subsequent clinical
trials before receiving FDA approval. It is estimated
that a newly designed drug takes 15 years to enter the
pharmaceutical market [5]. Consequently, it is important
to find more efficient methodical approaches that are also
economically feasible. Newer approaches that do not rely
solely on a single agent’s traditional cytotoxicity profile
are required in order to provide a more targeted, efficient
and enhanced form of cancer therapy. For instance,
monoclonal antibodies and chemoprevention with
naturally- compounds are examples of new strategies to
prevent or treat cancer [6-9].
The combination of two or more therapeutic
treatments to specifically target cancer-inducing or cellsustaining pathways is a cornerstone of cancer therapy
[10, 11]. Although the mono-therapy approach is still
a very common treatment modality for many different
forms of cancer, this conventional method is generally
deemed less effective than the combination therapy
approach [SOURCE]. Conventional mono-therapeutic
techniques non-selectively target actively proliferating
cells, which ultimately leads to the destruction of both
healthy and cancerous cells. Chemotherapy can be toxic
to the patient with multiple side effects and risks, and can
also strongly reduce their immune system by affecting
bone marrow cells and increasing susceptibility to host
diseases [12, 13]. Although combination therapy can be
toxic if one of the agents used is chemotherapeutic, the
toxicity is significantly less because different pathways
will be targeted. Ultimately, this works in a synergistic or
additive manner, and therefore a lower therapeutic dosage
of each individual drug is required [14, 15]. Additionally,
combination therapy may be able to prevent the toxic
effects on normal cells while simultaneously producing
cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. This may occur if one
drug in the combination regimen is antagonistic, in terms
of cytotoxicity, to another drug in normal cells, essentially
protecting normal cells from cytotoxic effects [16].
Consider a combination regimen that includes a caspaseinhibitor, such as Z-DEVD-fmk, and an apoptosisinducing agent. Specifically, Z-DEVD-fmk-resistant
cancer cells that express p-glycoprotein will pump out
Z-DEVD-fmk, but the apoptosis-inducing agent would
induce apoptosis in cancer cells [16]. However, most
normal cells do not express p-glycoprotein and thus they
will be directly affected by Z-DEVD-fmk and apoptosis
will resume [16]. This method would essentially increase
the therapeutic index of cancer therapy and produce a
more potent cytotoxic effect [16]. Further, monotherapy
treatment is more susceptible to drug resistance because
the constant treatment with a single compound induces
cancer cells to recruit alternative salvage pathways [17,
18]. As an example, cells in adenocarcinoma, when
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treated with doxorubicin, upregulate an ATP-dependent
cassette pump to eliminate the drug, leading to a state
of drug resistance [17]. However, combination therapy
can produce a more effective treatment response in
fewer cycles, and therefore this treatment modality
reduces the incidence of resistance [19, 20]. Finally,
chemotherapeutics essentially does not eliminate cancer
stem cells (CSCs) successfully due to their non-selective
therapeutic approach. This is a major disadvantage
because neoplasms harbour a subpopulation of CSCs
that give the tumour its self-renewal, differentiation and
invasive potential [21]. However, combination therapy
that includes agents that target CSCs (examples are
the notch inhibitor and the gamma-secretase inhibitor)
would therefore reduce drug resistance and attenuate the
likelihood of relapse [22].
Combination therapy was first conceptualized
in 1965, where Emil Frei, James F. Holland and Emil
J. Freireich postulated the possibility of the first ever
combination chemotherapy for acute leukemia [23].
Pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia
were treated with the combination of methotrexate,
6-mercaptopurine, vincristine and prednisone (formally
known as the POMP regimen) and was proven successful
in reducing tumour burden and prolonging remission
[23]. As a consequence of the success of the POMP
regimen, research in cancer therapy became focused on
investigating combination therapies that target different
pathways to create a synergistic or additive effect. For
example, in a study by Quinn et al., it was discovered that
sabutoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, in combination with
minocycline, an antibiotic that has previously displayed
anti-cancer effects acted synergistically on the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway. In addition, this combination displayed
selective toxicity and a reduction in tumour growth in
vitro and in vivo on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
[24]. Thus, using a combination of compounds that target
different pathways, a synergistic or potentiation effect
could yield significant anti-cancer results.
Recently, a newer approach in cancer therapy that
focuses on restrictive combinations (RC) of drugs is
emerging, although this approach has not yet been tested
on human patients. This restrictive approach focuses
on strategic dosing and drug administration in order
to spare normal cells while simultaneously creating a
targeted cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. To achieve this,
the combination regimen takes advantage of the slight
differences between cancer cells and normal cells, such as
the absence of a target (lack of p53), or by the presence of
a target (surface marker) [25]. The type of drugs used in
the combination regimen and the sequence in which they
are administered depends on what the slight differences
are between cancerous tissue and the normal cells [25].
For example, a p53-inducing agent, such as low dose
doxorubicin, causes G1/G2 arrest in non-target cells [25].
This arrest only occurs in normal cells if the cancerous
38023

cells lack p53. This arrest further protects normal cells
from the cytotoxicity of the following drug that is intended
to specifically kill cancer cells. In the next step of the
combination regimen, taxol is added to induce mitotic
arrest in actively dividing cells, targeted towards cancer
cells [25]. Additional drugs can be added to increase the
therapeutic potency in a synergistic manner but without
undesirable side-effects [25]. Because cancer cells are
heterogeneous, this method of treatment is alternated with
standard therapy in order to eliminate all cancer cells. As a
result, RC limits treatment resistance, lowers toxicity, and
increases efficacy [25].
Another therapeutic approach that has gained
publicity in cancer research is “drug repositioning”. Drug
re-purposing is a therapeutic approach where current
pharmaceutical agents primarily used for non-cancerous
diseases are being used for cancer treatment [26]. This
approach is efficient because the FDA-approved drug
would have already passed drug safety protocols and has
a known pharmacokinetic profile [27]. One such example
of drug re-positioning is acetazolamide, (AZ; Diamox),
a pan-carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. AZ is typically used
for the treatment of glaucoma, epilepsy, and altitude
sickness, but has recently been tailored for the treatment of
cancer [15, 28]. Its cancer-targeting relevance came to the
attention of researchers when it was discovered that cancer
cells display high carbonic anhydrase activity, which
correlates with malignant behavior; therefore, inhibiting
this activity would create anti-cancer effects. In another
example, Rapalog, an immunosuppressant that is primarily
used after organ transplantation to prevent graft rejection,
has shown to have cancer prevention properties [29]. One
possible explanation for Rapalog’s cancer preventative
activity revolves around its mTOR inhibitory role [29].
Since mTOR activity is high in malignant cancerous
tissue, Rapalog counteracts mTOR activity, preventing the
formation of tumours [29].
Drug repositioning has also shown to be useful
when traditional anti-cancer monotherapy has failed to
provide a safe and tolerable treatment for cancer patients.
For instance, the combination of drugs may consist of a
repurposed neo-protector agent, such as a cytostatic agent
that protects normal cells by arresting cell growth, and
a secondary or tertiary agent that kills cancer cells [30].
The neo-protector may be a repurposed agent that was
normally intended either as an anticancer drug or another
disease-related therapeutic, but has shown to also display
neo-protective roles over normal cells in cancer therapy
[30]. In this way, drug repositioning has provided cancer
research with new insights into efficiency and efficacy,
while also reducing the financial burden associated with
novel drug discovery. All in all, it would be reasonable
to suggest that more adequately well-designed clinical
research studies that test the combination of a repurposed
therapeutic agent and another cytotoxic agent should be
done in order to achieve greater efficacy in an expedient
manner.

In this review, we discuss some important cellular
pathways in cancer whose investigations have produced
copious results in the PubMed database search engine.
Pathways involved in the induction and sustaining of
cancer that can be targeted include autocrine growth
factors, hypoxia, carbonic anhydrase, antioxidant
response, apoptosis, angiogenesis and epigenetic factors.
These pathways have strong implications in cancer, and
our current investigations, in particular, have further
supported their roles in tumorigenesis [15, 28, 31]. Here,
we provide an updated clinical review of the most current
repurposed and prospective therapeutic combination
treatments that target these pathways.

PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN TUMOUR
GROWTH
Regulation of anti-oxidant response and tumorigenesis
through Nrf2 activation
Under extreme oxidative intrinsic and extrinsic
stress, cells have developed a systematic pathway to cope
with the stress through an antioxidant response, namely the
Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Under quiescent conditions, Kelchlike ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), an electrophile
and oxidant sensor, functions as an adaptor of Cul3-based
E3 ligase and subsequently promotes Nrf2 degradation.
Specifically, Keap1 first homodimerizes at the BTB
domain, and the BTB domain targets the Neh2 region of
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a basic
leucine zipper transcription factor (bZIP) to the E3 ligase
complex. Once this interaction occurs, Nrf2 becomes
ubiquitinated, targeting it for proteasomal degradation
[32, 33]. However, under extreme oxidative stress, either
due to the build-up of carcinogens or reactive oxygen
species (ROS), Nrf2 is actively localized in the nucleus to
elicit an anti-oxidative response. Nrf2 is also involved in
regulating drug metabolism, cytoprotection, proliferation,
growth differentiation and apoptosis [33]. Moreover, the
Nrf2 antioxidant response regulates tumorigenicity in
two ways [32]. Firstly, Nrf2 regulation occurs through
Keap1-dependent and Keap1-independent mechanisms.
In the Keap1-dependent mechanism, when intracellular
ROS is elevated, the cysteine residues of Keap1 become
oxidized, enabling Keap1 to dissociate from Nrf2 [34].
The sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues are involved
in sensing redox and electrophilic changes in the local
environment by covalently binding to electrophiles [35].
Specifically, the cysteine residues (Cys273 and Cys288) in
the intervening linker region of Keap1 are most reactive
and sensitive to oxidative changes [36]. This dissociation
of Keap1 from Nrf2 leads to the translocation of Nrf2 to
the nucleus [34]. The Keap1-independent mechanisms of
Nrf2 regulation primarily involve xenobiotic interactions
(i.e. by; sulforaphane), Nrf2 transcriptional regulation and
38024

autoregulation, and post-transcriptional regulation, such as
through microRNAs, phosphorylation and acetylation [33].
Once Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, Nrf2 recruits other
transcriptional machinery, such as CREB binding protein
(CBP), coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase
(CARM1) and protein arginine methyl-transferase
(PRMT1), leading to transactivation [33]. Further, Nrf2
heterodimerizes with either MAF (proto-oncogene c-Maf),
activating transcription factor (ATF) or AP-1 (activator
protein-1 transcription factor) and subsequently binds
to a specific promoter region (a cis-acting enhancer
sequence (TCAG/CXXXGC), termed the antioxidant
response element (ARE) element of antioxidant genes
[33, 37, 38]. Phase 2 detoxifying enzymes, NAD(P)H
quinone reductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferases
(GSTs), heme oxygenase 1, thioredoxin reductase, and
keto reductases are primarily involved in detoxifying
carcinogens [34, 39, 40]. In addition, other enzymes such
as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione
peroxidases are also regulated by the ARE transcriptional
region [41]. Moreover, evidence of Nrf2-dependent
chemopreventive activity was observed by Iida et al.,
where Nrf2 double-knockout C57BL/6 mice were more
susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of a urinary bladderspecific carcinogen, N-nitrosobutyl (4-hydroxybutyl)
amine (BBN), even when oltipraz, an inducer of phase
2 detoxifying enzymes genes that has a carcinogenic
preventive role, was added [42].

Furthermore, the second way Nrf2 regulates
tumorigenicity is by promoting the growth and survival
of cancer cells that have been already initiated because
Nrf2 and its antioxidant response participate in helping
the tumour deal with oxidative stress [43]. Nrf2 promotes
cancer cell proliferation since activation of phase 2
enzymes helps to reduce reactive oxygen species that
would normally lead to apoptosis. For example, Nrf2 was
upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the same
study it was shown that Nrf2 positively regulates GSTP1
(an enzyme that has a role in detoxification) [38]. These
results indicate how upregulation of Nrf2 is a positive
indicator of tumorigenesis due to its ability to help cancer
cells cope with oxidative stress.

Combination of pharmaceutical agents targeting
antioxidant response pathways
Due to the role of Nrf2 in tumour prevention and
progression, there are some pharmaceutical agents
that induce the upregulation of Nrf2 expression. One
such pharmaceutical agent is curcumin, the principal
curcuminoid derived compound from turmeric (Curcuma
longa) in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae [44]. Curcumin
suppresses the activity of carcinogens in a Nrf2-dependent
manner [45]. Curcuminoids are linear diarylheptanoids
that upregulate Nrf2 expression and induce Nrf2
translocation to the nucleus to elicit its antioxidant

effects by stabilizing protein levels of Nrf2. In addition,
curcuminoids upregulate glutathione levels which have
been shown to reduce ROS levels and remove carcinogens,
aiding in chemoprevention [46]. In a phase II doubleblind randomized study, curcuminoids in combination
with chemotherapy have displayed enhanced efficacy
with regards to reduced adverse side effects and improved
quality of life in patients with solid tumors, such as
colorectal, gastric, and breast cancer [47]. Curcuminoids
in combination with chemotherapy have demonstrated an
overall positive outcome, and have also shown to increase
the survival rate in some patients [48, 49].
Resveratrol, a phytoalexin derived from plants, has
displayed anti-oxidative and chemopreventive effects
through the activation of Nrf2 and consequently GSH
expression [45].
Our studies, as well as others, have shown the
effectiveness of resveratrol in combination therapy in
vitro and in vivo [50-53]. Chemoprevention is difficult
to assess clinically, however, which contributes to the
lack of phase II and III trials. However, a phase I trial
has shown that micronized resveratrol (SRT501) is a
good drug candidate for metastatic prevention. In this
study, upregulation of caspase-3, an apoptotic marker,
occurred in 39% of patients with hepatic malignancies;
this demonstrates the effectiveness of resveratrol in
preventing malignancies in other organs [54]. Another
agent, squalene, a natural isoprenoid, has also displayed
chemopreventive properties. Our lab showed that this
antioxidant compound has cytoprotective properties
against the side effects of chemotherapy. Squalene
reduces ROS levels and upregulates glutathione levels
among other detoxifying enzymes, with no effect on
tumor cells as in neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma
and medulloblastoma xenografts [55]. Squalene appears
to protect against chemotherapy toxicity and might be a
potent adjunct to anti-cancer treatments.
Naturally derived, sulforaphane (SFN) has
gathered a lot of attention in cancer chemoprevention.
SFN, an  isothiocyanate in the family of  organosulfur
compounds, has chemopreventive properties that are
thought to be due to potent upregulation of Nrf2. Under
normal cellular conditions, the transcriptional activity of
Nrf2 is regulated by the interaction of Nrf2 with the Keap1
dimer; this interaction creates a Nrf2-Keap1 complex
and prevents Nrf2 from translocating into the nucleus
[40]. SFN has been shown to disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1
complex by targeting and modifying the C151 domain of
Keap1 and thus diminishing the interaction of Nrf2 with
Keap1 [40]. When Nrf2 is not bound with Keap1, it is
free to translocate to the nucleus and elicit its antioxidant
effects by upregulating Phase 2 enzymes (Figure 1) [40].
SFN, however, is theorized to also take on an inhibitory
role when combined with other cytotoxic drugs for the
treatment of cancer. To test this theory, Kallifatidis et al.,
combined SFN with taxol in treatment of prostate cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell line DU145, and observed that SFN potentiated the
effects of low doses of taxol; the combination inhibited
viability and the clonogenicity of this cell line [56].
Further, SFN has demonstrated a significant ability to
inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and induce G2/M
cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo in multiple myeloma
cells and myeloma xenograft model, respectively [57].
Although SFN showed efficacy in targeting myeloma
cells, SFN also enhances the cytotoxicity of other antimyeloma drugs when used in a combination regimen.
SFN positively enhanced bortezomib, lenalidomide, and
conventional drugs, such as dexamethasone, doxorubicin,
and melphalan in a synergistic manner [57]. Likewise,
SFN also potentiated the apoptotic effects of oxaliplatin
in colorectal cancer Caco-2 cells [58]. A similar pattern
was observed in our lab, where the combination of SFN
and AZ showed enhanced efficacy in reducing tumor
growth and clonogenic ability in bronchial carcinoid cell
lines H727 and H720 (Figure 1) [15] and bladder cell lines
HTB-9 and RT112(H) [28]. It is, therefore, reasonable
to argue that the use of combination therapeutics that
includes an isothiocyanate, specifically SFN, may show
enhanced therapeutic effects. So far, SFN has displayed
promising results in in vitro and in vivo studies but has not
yet been tested in clinical trials, although its efficacy in
combination therapy warrants further studies. Moreover,
many cancer cells with elevated levels of Nrf2 have shown
enhanced growth potential, and increased drug resistance.
One such example is seen in human lung cancer, where
elevated Nrf2 expression leads to cisplatin resistance
[59]. Thus, it can be argued that a therapeutic agent that
reduces Nrf2 expression would prevent cancer cells from
protecting themselves from oxidative stress, leading to
induction of apoptosis. For example, in a study by Young
Cha et al., a histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid,
was shown to sensitize papillary thyroid cancer cells
to the activity of a chemotherapeutic agent, TRAIL,
a tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand. Consequently, downregulating Nrf2 expression
in papillary thyroid cancer cells with upregulated Nrf2
expression led to apoptosis and significantly inhibited
tumour growth in an orthotopic thyroid mouse model
[43]. So far, there has been successful completion of one
clinical trial to date testing the efficacy of SFN as an anticancer agent, but no clinical trials have been assigned that
test SFN in a combination regimen. In a double-blinded,
randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, SFN
has shown to significantly reduce levels of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) (44.4% SFN group vs. 71.8% in
placebo), an antigen that is commonly elevated in prostate
cancer after radical prostatectomy and used as a partial
biomarker for “biochemical recurrence”. In addition, the
PSA doubling time for the SFN group was 86% longer in
comparison to the placebo group, all suggesting that SFN
provides clinical efficacy in cancer prevention, specifically
for prostate cancer [60].

In another example, metformin, an agent used
to treat type 2 diabetes, was found to increase the
susceptibility of wild-type p53 breast cancer cell line
MCF-7 to TRAIL by upregulating microRNA-34a
expression. This upregulation led to the downregulation of
Nrf2/Sirt1/Pgc-1alpha pathway and Nrf2 regulated genes
(HO-1 and SOD2) that are activated in an antioxidant
response. As a result, the breast cancer cells became
increasingly susceptible to oxidative stress and hence,
TRAIL-induced apoptosis [61]. Nrf2-downregulating
agents have displayed propitious outcomes, but there
are no clinical trials as of yet to test their anti-cancer
capabilities, although these agents warrant further studies.

be considered valuable candidates for cancer research due
to their high potential therapeutic benefits.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in combination
therapy
As discussed earlier, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(CAIs) have multiple treatment purposes, such as in
glaucoma therapy, epilepsy, anti-infective treatment,
and also certain types of cancers [66, 77, 78]. In the
1970s, CAI was first used for the treatment of peptic
ulcers by Ioan Puşcaş and colleagues [79]. The lack of
unwanted side effects ultimately resulted in CAI being
used for therapies against other medical conditions, and
it eventually led to the discovery of CAI being used as an
anti-cancer compound [79]. CAIs range from having nonisoform-specific activity to isoform-specific activity, and
thus, whether to use pan-CAI treatment verses isoformspecific CAI depends on the type of therapy required [78,
80]. AZ, for example, is a pan-CAI that is currently in
the development for the treatment of cancers, although
its former FDA-approved use is primarily for glaucoma
and epilepsy treatment. AZ has shown promising results
in anti-cancer activity when given solely since it displayed
anti-invasive effects on renal cell cancer lines and HT29
colorectal cancer cells [81, 82]. However, for the treatment
of bronchial carcinoid and bladder cancer, when AZ
is combined with SFN, cancer efficacy was additively
enhanced compared to monotherapy of each agent; the
enhanced efficacy was attributed to increased inhibitory
effects on clonogenic and invasive ability in vitro, and
increased tumor growth inhibitory effects in vivo (Figure
1) [15, 28]. SFN has also shown to play a significant role
in sensitizing ovarian carcinoma cell line derivatives,
adriamycin-resistant A2780/ADR and cisplatin-resistant
A2780/CP. Hypoxic conditions provide optimal conditions
for tumour growth and SFN modulates the pathways
involved in cell proliferation and survival. Specifically,
SFN activates various anti-cancer responses such as p53,
ARE, IRF-1, Pax-6 and XRE while suppressing proteins
involved in tumorigenesis and progression, such as
HIF1α, AP-1 and CA IX. SFN has thus shown to reduce
chemoresistance and may be a potential agent to be used
in conjunction with chemotherapeutics [83]. Recently,
benzenesulfonamide derivatives have been synthesized to
possess CAI activity for CA I, II and IX while displaying
cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cell line MCF-7, with
varying IC50s [84]. Another CAIX inhibitor, sulfamate
(S4), was tested on a laryngeal tumor model in a study
done by Meijer et al., but did not display significant antitumour and anti-proliferative effects to be used as a single
agent [85]. However, in another study, it was postulated
that in combination with the proton pump inhibitor
lansoprazole it potentiated the effects of melanoma
Me30966 cells treated with CAIX specific inhibitor FC9-

Hypoxia and the carbonic anhydrase pathway
Cancer cells have properties that differ from
normal cells, and one of those important properties is
their abnormal growth pattern due in part to an erratic
vasculature. This abnormal growth pattern consequently
results in a large diffusion distance between nutritive
blood vessels [62]. The lack of oxygenated blood
supplying the tumour creates strong hypoxic conditions
favouring the emergence of tumour-initiating cells;
the lack of oxygen inhibits tumor differentiation and
upregulates programming that allows CSCs to flourish
[63]. Additionally, hypoxic conditions drive cancer
cells towards adopting anaerobic glycolysis, instead of
oxidative phosphorylation, which inherently leads to lactic
acid build-up and a lower extracellular pH level in the
tumor microenvironment [64]. Moreover, during hypoxia,
hypoxic inducible factor-1 (HIF1alpha), a transcription
factor, translocates into the nucleus, where it dimerizes
with HIF-1beta and leads to the expression of various
genes involved in angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, cellular survival, and metastasis. It is
interesting to note that regulation of HIF1alpha via prolyl
hydroxylase, PHD (the O2 sensor) is another example like
Keap1-Nrf2 where the transcription factor HIF1alpha is
normally recycled (under normoxia) but is dissociated
from PHD under hypoxia. A particularly important gene
activated by HIF1alpha is carbonic anhydrase (CA) [65].
CAs help tumours adapt to hypoxic stress by catalyzing
the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to a proton and
bicarbonate and thereby neutralizing the acidic conditions
of the tumor microenvironment [65, 66]. Although there
are a total of 15 CA isoforms in the human body, CAIX
[67, 68] and CAXII [69] isoforms have been shown to
be the target of many carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(CAIs) because their overexpression in various tumors
is correlated with poor survival and progression (Figure
2) [70-72]. CAIX overexpression is correlated with poor
prognosis partly because these cells are highly enriched
in stemness properties [73-75]; in vivo testing has
demonstrated that stem cell regulation is highly dependent
on pH regulation [76]. Thus, agents that target CA should

399A or S4 treatment [86]. This combination resulted in an
enhanced dose-dependent tumor inhibitory response and
cytotoxicity. Moreover, combination therapy involving
CAIs continues to present promising results of enhanced
efficacy, such as those shown in a study done by Gieling
et al., where CAI, AZ, enhanced the efficacy and toxicity
of basic toxic agent, doxorubicin (DOX) in human colon
carcinoma cell line HT29 by enhancing the cellular uptake
of DOX. In addition, CA9/18 cells that have upregulated
CAIX expression showed the highest AZ+DOX
combinatorial efficacy [87]. Given this growing evidence,
it is reasonable to support the use of carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors in combination therapies for cancer. Although
CAI in combination therapy has shown promising anticancer effects in preclinical studies, clinical trials have yet
to be conducted. Only one recently completed clinical trial
testing the monotherapy treatment of CAI, SLC-0111, for
the treatment of solid tumours is reported [88].

cells exhibit a different DNA architecture in comparison to
normal cells, as cancer cells are typically less differentiated
and the chromatin contains more histones that compact the
DNA [89]. As a result, cancer cells typically expose fewer
open regions of DNA for transcription. As cancer cells
become characteristically less differentiated, they behave
more invasively because differentiation inhibits cellular
movement [90]. Consequently, epigenetic regulation
that modulates gene expression becomes highly active in
cancer and therefore offers valuable therapeutic targets.
There are various ways the epigenome is modified,
including DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone
phosphorylation, histone ubiquitination, and other
post-translational modifications [91]. Mutations in the
enzymes that regulate the epigenome can potentially
lead to cancer-like states because of their ability to create
gross effects [92]. Cancer mutations, such as mutations
in histone acetylase, histone deacetylase (HDAC), and
transcription factors, can lead to either an upregulation
or downregulation of gene products they target and
therefore the ability to drive a tumour into a more stemlike, undifferentiated state [92]. Due to the properties of
epigenetic modifiers, many important cancer treatments
target them.
In the past 10 years, histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACi) in particular, have emerged as important agents
of interest in clinical trials for all types of diseases [93].
The specific appeal of HDACi for cancer treatment is due
to their vast array of anti-cancer effects, such as the ability
to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
inhibit angiogenesis [94]. HDAC itself has also exhibited

Epigenetics and histone modulation pathway in
cancer
Epigenetics is the study of chromatin dynamics with
a focus on the regulation of gene expression as opposed
to changes in DNA sequences. Epigenetic regulation
accounts for the expression and silencing of certain genes
and regulates the structure of the genome to produce a
cellular homeostatic environment. As a consequence of
mutations and stress, the epigenetic modulation pathway
can be altered to give rise to cancer and correspondingly
up-regulation of proliferative activity. Additionally, cancer

extensive activity in cancer cells [94] because HDAC aids
in cancer morphology by compacting chromatin, creating
an un-differentiated state. In addition, tumour cells are
more sensitive to HDACi-induced apoptosis in comparison
to normal cells, albeit the reason is still unknown [94].
Moreover, the specific function of HDACi is to inhibit the
activity of histone deacetylases, enzymes that deacetylate
the lysine residues on histone molecules, leading to
the inaccessibility of transcriptionally active regions
of DNA (Figure 3). HDAC plays a role in epigenetics
and chromatin dynamics by essentially regulating gene
expression.
Although under-regulation of HDACs has been
involved or present in many cancers, over-regulation
of HDACs has been found in a variety of cancers. For
example, HDAC10 (one class of HDAC) have shown
to be increased in gastric cancers [95]. In another
study, it was found that HDAC1 mRNA expression
was upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer and was
associated with a low differentiated grade tumour,
while lung adenocarcinoma with upregulated HDAC1
mRNA expression was associated with poor prognosis
[96]. Also, a common modification of HDAC that
leads to many human cancers is a global loss o’{
f monoacetylation of the Lys16 residue of histone H4 [97].
Consequently, HDACi are able to effectively inhibit the
invasiveness and aggressiveness of cancer phenotypes
that express this Lys16 mutation amongst other HDAC
mutations [97].

Research on creating novel therapeutic treatments
utilizes the knowledge of common epigenetic modifier
mutations in specific cancers and uses them as therapeutic
targets. For example, studies have introduced epigenetic
modifier gene mutations into mouse hematopoietic
stem cells. Results show that the epigenetic mutation
increased cancer stem cell properties such as self-renewal
capability [98]. Furthermore, therapeutic treatments, such
as HDACi targeting epigenetic modifiers, are emerging
primarily because of the plasticity of the epigenome and
its reversibility. HDACs are common targets for cancer
therapy as their dysregulation is associated with many
forms of cancers; HDACi is therefore frequently tested in
clinical trials. Trichostatin A was the first HDACi tested
in clinical trials while vorinostat, a potent inhibitor of
HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC6, was the first
FDA-approved HDACi for the treatment of persistent,
progressive or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [99,
100]. Due to the successful results of vorinostat, many
other HDACi has been applied in the treatment of cancers,
such as romidepsin for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and
Panobinostat for the treatment of multiple myeloma [101,
102].
Repurposed HDACi have also been tailored for
the treatment of diverse cancers, such as valproic acid
(VPA) originally used for the treatment of epilepsy, and
romidepsin originally FDA-approved for hematological
cancers such as cutaneous and peripheral T-cell

lymphoma but have also shown anti-cancer effects in
solid tumours [103, 104]. Additionally, repurposed
HDACi in combination with other agents have been
tested in clinical trials; however, not all displayed
promising results due to the build-up of toxic side effects
or insignificant effects. For instance, recently a phase
II randomized study was done testing the effects of
VPA and decitabine on patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome [105]. The
results demonstrated that there were no significant
differences between the effects of single agent treatment
with decitabine and combination therapy with decitabine
and VPA. Complete remissions of 31% and 37%
(p=0.497) respectively were observed, although preclinical
studies demonstrated a significant difference in growth
inhibition and apoptosis. Similar results were obtained
in a randomized phase III study of VPA in combination
with an all-trans retinoid for intensive therapy in the
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in the elderly, where
the combination resulted in low complete remission
rates and increased VPA-related hematological toxicities
[106]. The combination of VPA (75-100 mcg/mL) and
5-azacytidine (5-AZA) (75 mg/m^2) delivered daily for 10
days in patients with advanced cancers such as colorectal,
melanoma and breast cancers, were deemed safe, but did
not particularly result in enhanced anti-cancer efficacy
compared to 5-AZA monotherapy [107]. Although these
studies do not particularly demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating VPA, further studies of VPA in combination
with other cytotoxic agents are still warranted. It may be
that VPA is too weak of an HDACi as compared to others
to be discussed.
Romidepsin, another repurposed agent, was tested
in combination with gemcitabine on solid advanced
tumours of the pancreas, breast, non-small cell lung
cancer, ovaries, and others [103]. Results have shown a
partial response of 7% of patients while 52% of patients
responded with a stable disease. In addition, a majority
of the adverse events seen were non-hematological, such
as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue while 47% of patients
also experienced hematological abnormalities. As stated
in the study, a phase 2 trial is warranted and demonstrates
the promising effects of repurposed drugs in combination
therapy. Moreover, FDA-approved HDACi were further
assessed in combination with other therapeutic agents
in clinical trials. For example, in a phase 1 clinical trial
study, proteasome inhibitor marizomib (0.7 mg/m^2 on
days 1, 8 and 15-82) in combination with vorinostat (300
mg/day on days 1-16) displayed enhanced therapeutic
benefits compared to either agent alone in patients with
melanoma [108]. The combination of both agents did not
increase toxicity beyond the toxicity profile of each agent
alone and appeared to synergistically induce cellular stress
levels because marizomib inhibits proapoptotic factor
degradation while vorinostat inhibits the formation of
aggresomes that marizomib induces. As a result, tumour
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

size decreased in in 39% of patients.
There is currently a synthetic benzamide HDACi,
MS-275 (entinostat or SNDX-275) that has undergone
several clinical trials [109, 110]. MS-275 selectively
inhibits HDAC1/2 [111]. Since HDAC1 expression
level is upregulated in prostate, gastric, colon and
breast carcinomas whereas HDAC2 expression level is
upregulated in colorectal, cervical and gastric cancers,
MS-275 treatment on these types of cancers seem
promising [112]. This therapeutic agent does not cause
cardiotoxicity, a major benefit of HDACi, as reported
in phase 1 clinical trials on solid and hematologic
malignancies [109, 113]. However, its half-maximal
inhibitory concentration is higher than most hydroxamic
acid HDACi, being in the micromolar range as opposed
to nanomolar [93]. Due to MS-275 requiring high
inhibitory concentrations to give the desired effect, it
can be argued that MS-275 in combination with another
therapeutic agent might demonstrate potentiation effects,
and thus lower the therapeutically required dose of MS275. Notably, in our preclinical study, we discovered that
the combination of AZ (40 μM) and MS-275 (0.75 μM)
displayed significantly higher effects on cell viability,
reduction in migration capacity, and growth inhibitory
effects compared to either agent alone for the treatment of
neuroblastoma. Although MS-275 is a potent HDACi, it is
toxic to both normal cells and cancer cells. In our study, we
saw that AZ potentiated the efficacy of MS-275 at a lower
dose, which creates the highest efficacy required with the
lowest possible toxic effects on normal cells [114]. This
finding is important since both drugs used in our study are
repurposed FDA-approved drugs and the doses fall within
the clinically accepted range. Combination therapy that
includes MS-275 has also undergone clinical investigation.
For example, in a phase I/II study, the combination of
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (30
mg/m^2/d, 40 mg/m^2/d) and MS-275 (7 mg) was
administered to patients with refractory advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Results obtained were encouraging
and warranted further study. This combination was safe
and well-tolerated, and the combination therapy was
shown to improve overall survival rate (6.4 months vs.
4 months) and progression-free survival compared to the
current therapeutics available for this type of cancer [115,
116]. In summary, HDAC poses a promising target in the
development of therapeutic treatments and repurposed
HDACi warrant further clinical studies.

Autocrine growth factors in cancer survival
Cellular physiology relies on cell signaling for
homeostatic equilibrium and communication. The
secreting cell varies in the type of secretion effector method
with regards to signaling. For instance, the secreting cell
can secrete substances either in an endocrine, paracrine,
or an autocrine fashion. When the effector substance is
38030

Oncotarget

secreted into the blood stream affecting a remote cell, it
is known as endocrine communication. The paracrine
and autocrine forms of communication are defined as
the secretion of messenger substances from one cell to
a neighboring cell through diffusion, and from one cell
onto itself through ligand/receptor interaction, respectively
[117]. One type of effector substance that is prevalent in
cancers operating to enhance a malignant characteristic is
the autocrine growth factor where pro-proliferative activity
is mediated through an autocrine growth loop [117]. There
are many types of autocrine growth factors, with the major
ones in cancer being vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like
growth factor-2 (IGF-2), epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin), to
name a few [117-120]. If growth factors do not respond
to negative regulatory signals, cancer may result as a
consequence of excessive proliferation. VEGF acts by
inducing angiogenesis in hypoxic conditions [119] and
will be discussed in depth in the next section (Figure 2).
IGF-1 is a growth factor involved in cancer proliferation
and inhibition of apoptosis. IGF-1 mechanism of action
involves the binding of IGF-1 to the IGF receptors, which
correspondingly activates intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity,
leading to autophosphorylation and subsequent secondary
messenger effects [121]. According to some epidemiologic
studies, patients with type 2 diabetes are at a higher risk
of developing cancer due to the elevated activity of IGF1[122].
5-HT, a potent bioactive molecule that primarily
acts on G-coupled protein receptors/5-HT receptors,
has diverse effects in the body, ranging from its
neurotransmitter role in depression to its hormonal role
in cancer [123]. There are 14 different 5-HT receptors,
which are distinguished based on their location on the
axonal terminal. Additionally, whether the signaling is
excitatory and inhibitory depends on the type of 5-HT
receptor on the membrane [123]. 5-HT biology is an
important area of cancer research as it has presented a
significant involvement in cancer. Specifically, 5-HT
has displayed tumorigenic effects in various cancers
in terms of cancer proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects,
angiogenesis, and cellular survival, through the activation
of a second messenger cascade [124, 125]. For instance,
5-HT receptors were shown to be overexpressed in
bladder cancer [126], prostate cancer [127], breast cancer
[128], and neuroendocrine type cancers [118]. Recently,
the role of 5-HT attenuation on angiogenesis has been
discovered, as it has been shown that 5-HT stimulates
angiogenic signaling kinases, which also demonstrates
its role in metastasis [129]. Our lab’s recent focus on
the role of 5-HT in cancer has yielded several reports,
illustrating the significance of 5-HT as an autocrine
growth factor in cancer and specifically, the pathobiology
of respiratory cancers [15, 130-132]. In normal lung
tissue, neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) produce and secrete
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significant amounts of 5-HT especially under hypoxic
conditions. HIF1alpha has been shown to be upregulated
in a significant portion of 5-HT positive cells [130, 131]
making a connection with this regulatory pathway. It was
discovered that hypoxia induces the release of 5-HT from
neuroepithelial bodies [133]. As the studies also used
5-HT-producing lung tumour cell lines, 5-HT is suggested
to serve as an autocrine factor regulating the proliferation
of the cells through an autocrine growth factor effect.
Furthermore, in the neuroendocrine bronchial atypical
carcinoid cell line H720, 5-HT appeared to stimulate
pro-proliferative effects via 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors
[118]. Thus, among the other growth factors, 5-HT has
displayed vigorous proliferative roles in cancer and as
a consequence, 5-HT may be vulnerable to therapeutic
intervention if the malignancy is dependent on an
autocrine growth factor loop [117].

Targeting 5-HT autocrine growth factor in
combination therapy
The 5-HT autocrine growth factor receptor is a
promising target for therapeutic intervention for cancer
cells that overexpress 5-HT receptors in in vitro and in
vivo studies. Specifically, in neuroendocrine tumors, it
was discovered that 5-HT2B receptor was only expressed
in neoplastic small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors of
enterochromaffin (SI-NET EC cell-derived) cell line and
not in normal EC cells [134]. Proliferative activity was
reduced in the KRJ-I cell line of SI-NET when targeted by
PRX-08066, a 5-HT2B inhibitor, through decreased 5-HT
autocrine secretion [134]. Thus far, 5-HT targeting agents
in combination therapy have yet to be tested in clinical
trials for cancer therapy but have displayed significant
outcomes in preclinical settings. For instance, it has
been previously reported that repurposed acetazolamide
(AZ) reduced 5-HT secretion and proliferation in human
renal carcinoma cells [81, 135, 136]. Additionally, it was
reported that SFN downregulates 5-HT receptor expression
in Caco-2 cells [137] Conclusively, in our previous study,
the combination of AZ and SFN significantly reduced the
5-HT-induced growth of bronchial carcinoid cell lines
H727 and H720 in an additive manner [15]. Due to the role
of 5-HT in proliferation, tumorgenicity, and in carcinoid
syndrome, as it was discovered that carcinoid syndrome
is due to an overexpression of 5-HT secretion [138],
it would be beneficial to consider clinical trial testing
of the combination of cytotoxic agents and therapeutic
agents that target 5-HT directly or indirectly, in order to
potentially create either a synergistic or additive effect for
efficacy.

metastasis from occurring and one of the approaches is
by inhibiting angiogenesis. Due to the high metabolic
requirements of cancer cells for growth, and the increased
diffusion distance between cancer cells and blood vessels,
tumours generally experience hypoxic conditions. As
a result, angiogenesis helps to sustain their metabolic
needs but also induces their invasive characteristics. This
process is firstly initiated by hypoxia-induced HIF1alpha
expression. HIF1alpha has been shown to mediate
the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) [145]. HIF1alpha binds to promoter elements in
the transcriptional region of VEGF-A, an autocrine growth
factor that contributes to the process of angiogenesis, and
thereby induces its expression [146]. Moreover, there
are a family of ligands (VEGF-A to-D) that bind to the
vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor
superfamily, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2; however, VEGF-A
and –B have shown to have the highest affinity for these
receptors [147]. VEGF-A bound to VEGFR-2 produces
the most prominent angiogenic effects [147]. There are
many cancers that exhibit high angiogenesis activity
either through overexpressing VEGF or its receptors
or downstream effectors in the VEGF/VEGF receptor
pathway, as in breast cancer [148], invasive bladder
cancer [149], colon cancer, [150] and melanoma [151].
Thus, anti-angiogenesis therapy would be an appropriate
approach as an anti-cancer modality.
Mechanistically, drugs that inhibit angiogenesis
deprive tumour cells of vital nutrients and oxygen, and
therefore they suppress tumor growth and progression
[152]. Anti-angiogenic activity is evident in metronomic
chemotherapy, a new approach to controlling tumor
growth. Here, chronic administration of a low dose of
drugs with anti-angiogenic properties is an effective
strategy in cancer treatment [153, 154]. As a result, it
is important to target factors upregulated in hypoxic
conditions prior to metastasis, such as VEGF/VEGFR for
the achievement of a potent anti-cancer effect.

There currently are various therapeutics in the
pharmaceutical drug market that target autocrine growth
factors in cancer. EGFR, a growth factor receptor that is
often regulated through the autocrine growth factor loop
in normal bronchial epithelial cells and lung cancer cells
[120], was investigated in a phase II study by Ichihara et
al., where gefitinib in combination with bevacizumab was
administered as a potential first-line therapy for patients
with non-small-cell-lung cancer with EGFR mutations.
This combination resulted in a 69% partial response,
4.7% complete response and 23.8% stable disease;
adverse effects were tolerable. The results conclusively
warrant additional studies [139]. Figitumumab, a
monoclonal antibody targeting IGF1R, combined
with chemotherapeutics displayed varying results. For
example, in a phase Ib dose-escalation open-label study,
figitumumab (20 mg/kg) combined with docetaxel (75
mg/kg) was deemed safe in patients with advanced
malignancies such as sarcoma, non-small cell lung
cancer, gastric, and ovarian cancers [140]. However, in a
phase II randomized study of figitumumab and docetaxel
combination on patients with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer, serious toxic adverse effects,
including grade 3/4-5 events, were observed, rendering
this combination unviable. [141]. In a randomized phase
III trial, the addition of IGF1R inhibitor, ganitumab,
displayed insufficient efficacy as a first-line therapy
for the treatment of patients with adenocarcinoma of
the pancreas, as it did not result in better survival rates
compared to gemcitabine monotherapy [142]. However,
in a phase 2 randomized double-blind study, ganitumab in
combination with gemcitabine displayed a better 6-month
survival rate and overall survival rate compared to the
placebo in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer,
which demonstrates that IGF1R inhibitors may display
propitious outcomes in combination therapy if the right
combinations are used [143].

Anti-angiogenesis therapeutic agents and their
use in combination therapy

Angiogenesis- a cancer-sustaining pathway

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
and its receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGFR) are normally expressed in many
cells but show significant upregulation in many types of
cancers, including bladder carcinoma [155], and breast
angiosarcoma [156]. As a result, many therapeutic agents
are aimed at targeting the VEGF/VEGFR complex.
Recently, a repurposed anti-angiogenic agent has been
selected and tested in clinical trials. Itraconazole, an
anti-fungal agent, has shown to inhibit endothelial cell
proliferation and migration, and inhibit activation of
VEGFR2 and FGFR3 in vitro and in vivo in non-small cell
lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H358, NCI-H1838, NCI-H596

Neoplasms that become aggressive are characterized
as malignant and have the potential to metastasize. In the
malignant state, tumour cells can potentially separate
from the primary mass and migrate towards capillaries,
eventually invading through the endothelium and
entering the blood circulation. Thereafter, tumour cells
can circulate throughout the body and migrate out of
the capillaries into distant organs, where they can form
another tumour, a process termed metastasis. Once cancer
has metastasized, it becomes very difficult to treat by
conventional therapeutics [144]. Therefore, it becomes
important to find pharmaceutical agents that prevent

Oncotarget

and NCI-H1975) [157]. Furthermore, itraconazole was
used in combination with pemetrexed, a chemotherapy
drug, for the treatment of non-squamous non-smallcell lung cancer in a phase II clinical trial. Results
demonstrated significant differences in the overall survival
media of 8 months and 32 months between the control,
pemetrexed monotherapy, and experimental, pemetrexed
and itraconazole combined treatment. In addition, toxicity
profiles were not significantly different between the
two treatments [158]. Furthermore, the combination of
itraconazole and chemotherapy agents (irinotecan-based)
on metastatic pancreatic cancer showed promising results
(8% complete response, 39% partial response, 32% stable
disease, 13% progressive disease and 47% response rate)
with limited toxicities [159].
One of the more common anti-angiogenic agents is
bevacizumab, an antibody that displays VEGF inhibitory
activity through antibody mediation. In a study by Yue et
al., bevacizumab in combination with turmeric ethanolic
extract (with absorbable curcumin) exhibited enhanced
anti-cancer effects in HT29 colonic cancer cells compared
to monotherapy through tumour growth inhibition, proapoptotic effects and blood vessel growth inhibition [160].
In a phase 2 open-labeled randomized trial, erlotinib
combined with bevacizumab was used as a first-line
therapy for patients with advanced non-squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations [161]. This
combination has shown promising results in terms of anticancer efficacy as all patients’ tumours were reduced in
size, while progression-free survival was maintained and
69% of patients displayed an objective response compared
to 64% of patients in the erlotinib alone group. While this
combination displayed some toxic effects, efficacy and
safety profiles are still being elucidated through BELIEF
(NCT01562028) and ACCRU RC1126 (NCT01532089).
Furthermore, adaptive resistance may pose
limitations on single agent treatment with anti-angiogenic
drugs. Adaptive resistance occurs when the treatment
creates unforeseen changes in the tumour morphology
and vascularization, and this resistance is partly due to
the induction of hypoxic factors that recruit other proangiogenic factors not targeted by the original therapeutic
intervention [162]. However, adaptive resistance can
be prevented by the use of combination treatment,
such as shown in a study by Hartwich et al., where the
suppression of HIF1alpha using topotecan potentiated the
effects of bevacizumab in neuroblastoma NB1691 cell
line, significantly reducing tumour growth compared to
either treatment alone [163]. The additional targeting of
hypoxia-inducing factors such as HIF1alpha or carbonic
anhydrases may contribute to enhanced anti-tumour
activity and reduce angiogenic resistance since it would
target a different angiogenic pathway that contributes to
the expression of VEGF and blood vessel formation. In a
preclinical study, we demonstrated that the combination of
the anti-angiogenic agent pazopanib and a topoisomerase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitor, oral metronomic topotecan, inhibited
tumour growth and reduced microvessel formation in
neuroblastoma xenografts, although some resistance was
observed [31]. Due to this promising result, our study
recently received permission to continue in a clinical trial
setting (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02303028).
Avastin, an anti-angiogenic drug, may also potentiate
chemotherapeutic drugs and consequently sensitize
cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy
[164]. First, metronomic therapy acts as anti-angiogenic
therapy, inducing hypoxic conditions as a result of lack
of blood flow to the tumour. Hypoxic conditions stabilize
HIF1alpha, trans-activating genes such as VEGF.
However, avastin specifically inhibits VEGF, and therefore
this combination demonstrates that avastin sensitizes
cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of metronomic
chemotherapy [164].
These aforementioned studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of repurposed and regular antiangiogenic agents combined with factors that decrease
or inhibit the hypoxic conditions or factors of the
tumor microenvironment. Thus there is a need for more
combination interventions that target these pathways either
synergistically, additively, or in a potentiating manner.

Apoptosis pathway in cancer
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a vital
function during normal development, as cells that
have undergone irreversible DNA damage or have
been negatively affected by carcinogens can lead to
tumour formation and potentially cancer. During cancer
development, inhibition of apoptosis is complemented
by activation of pro-survival mechanisms for cancer cell
progression and growth. Thus, many therapeutic agents
are designed to target apoptotic and cell cycle pathways.
There are two main apoptotic pathways involved in
normal human physiology: the extrinsic pathway and the
intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway constitutes death
receptors and ligands, FasL/FasR, APO-1/Fas (CD95),
TNF-alpha/TNFR1, Apo3L/DR3, Apo2L/DR4, and
Apo2L/DR5 that are part of the tumour necrosis factor
(TNF) gene superfamily. These death receptors trigger
intracellular signaling that results in the cleaving and
activation of caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-8,
which ultimately lead to apoptosis [165, 166]. The CD95
and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor
1/2 are the most commonly targeted death receptors in
therapeutic intervention. CD95 is a receptor-regulated in
immune activity, where the CD95 ligand activates T-cells,
producing an immune response that leads to programmed
cell death [165]. Cancer cells have evolved mechanisms
that disrupt the normal physiological response of apoptosis
through either downregulating the expression of surface
death receptors, such as CD95 and TRAIL receptors, or
by overexpressing decoy receptors that are involved in
38033

Oncotarget

preventing the normal apoptotic response [165]. This
apoptotic disruption is strongly correlated with drug
resistance; for example, downregulation of CD95 surface
expression leads to therapeutic treatment resistance in
leukemia [167].
An equally important apoptotic pathway that
cancer cells can manipulate is the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis. Members of the Bcl family, which are proapoptotic or anti-apoptotic factors, permeabilize the outer
mitochondrial membrane [165]. This process leads to the
release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the intermembrane
space into the cytosol, leading to apoptosis activation
[165]. In a study by Cotter et al., it was postulated that
various cancers have elevated levels of anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins [168]. Bcl-2 proteins contribute to cell
survival in a two-fold manner: Bcl-2 inhibits adaptors
that are required for apoptotic activation and also cleaves
caspases, leading to the nuclear and cell fragmentation
that are characteristic of apoptosis [169]. Bcl-2 is used
as a prognosis marker in non-small-cell lung cancer
(NCI-H460), and was correlated with unfavourable
histology in neuroblastoma (stages I-IV) and was
overexpressed in prostate cancer (LNCaP) [170-172].
Thus, it can be argued that therapeutics that aim to target
these anti-apoptotic or pro-survival proteins would lead to
increased anti-cancer efficacy.

An additional repurposed therapeutic agent that has
gained some attention from researchers is clarithromycin
(CAM), a macrolide antibiotic normally used to treat
bacterial infections involving the skin and respiratory
system [176]. This agent has been shown to enhance
endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis when
combined with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor,
although CAM has shown to only be efficacious when
administered in a combination regimen in breast cancer
and myeloma cells [177, 178]. In another study, the
combination of HDACi SAHA, with bortezomib and
CAM, induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. This
particular combination was chosen because these
compounds work synergistically and inhibit the ability
of cancer cells to adapt to cellular stress [179]. Although
in vitro studies using CAM in combination with other
agents have shown promising results, in vivo and clinical
testing have not yet been assessed; further studies are
recommended.
There are still many apoptosis-inducing agents out
in the market that are being evaluated in clinical trials,
whether as a single agent or in combination therapy [180182]. For instance, in a randomized phase II study, 10
mg/kg of conatumumab, a monoclonal antibody agonist
against TRAIL, combined with FOLFIRI chemotherapy
(folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) displayed
tolerable toxicity profiles and modest progressionfree survival in mutant KRAS metastatic colorectal
cancer [183]. Although this combination was not
statistically significant enough for further investigation,
clinical investigations of other combination therapies
involving conatumumab may still provide efficacious
results. Nonetheless, studies displaying the efficacy of
combination therapy set a precedent for more research
combining therapeutic agents that induce apoptosis.

Apoptosis targeting agents in combination
therapy
Many therapeutic agents aim to target factors that
either upregulate pro-apoptotic factors or inhibit prosurvival mechanisms (Figure 3). Repurposed therapeutic
agents have demonstrated many advantages both
therapeutically, temporally, and financially but there
are only a couple of repurposed drugs with apoptosisinducing properties that are currently under clinical
investigation. One repurposed agent that possesses the
ability to induce apoptosis indirectly is nitroglycerin, an
agent used to treat angina. Nitroglycerin is a nitric oxide
(NO) donor, and nitric oxide has been found to induce
apoptosis as a secondary effect alongside its primary role
in downregulating HIF1alpha and inhibiting angiogenesis
[173, 174]. Furthermore, one randomized phase II trial
demonstrated that nitroglycerin in combination with the
chemotherapeutics vinorelbine and cisplatin improved
overall survival of patients with untreated stage IIIB/IV
non-squamous cell lung cancer [175]. Due to the ability
of nitroglycerin to ameliorate hypoxic conditions, it was
postulated that it might improve resistance when combined
with chemotherapy, although definite answers have not yet
been provided. The results of this study demonstrated that
nitroglycerin improved the response rate to vinorelbine
with tolerable toxicity, and also stated that a phase III trial
is warranted, although one has not yet been initiated.

DISCUSSION
Multiple therapeutic designs have been developed
to target various cancer pathways. Combination therapy
has provided the most effective results with regards to
anti-cancer effects. Its superiority stems from the ability
to target multiple pathways, which essentially minimizes
drug resistance because cancer cells are frequently
incapable of adapting to the simultaneous toxic effects of
two therapeutic agents [184]. Moreover, various pathways
are dysregulated in cancer cells and have disrupted
homeostatic environments that generally contribute to the
rapid proliferation rate. For instance, studies have shown
that various cancers have mutations in tumour suppressor
genes, such as p53, that normally function to activate cell
cycle arrest when DNA is damaged. However, if tumour
suppressor genes are mutated, accumulation of damaged
DNA and inhibition of cell cycle arrest contribute
to increasingly rapid proliferation rates and a more
aggressive cancer [185]. Additionally, in cancer cells,

upregulated production of autocrine growth factors or an
upregulated autocrine loop can further contribute to the
growth of tumour cells [186, 187]. If the tumour size has
increased substantially, neoadjuvant chemotherapy might
be indicated prior to surgical resection of the tumour; here,
combination chemotherapy may potentially aid in survival.
With regards to autocrine growth factors, if VEGF is
upregulated, metastasis can also occur, which may worsen
the prognosis and survival rate [188, 189]. Therefore,
targeting various pathways via multiple drug combinations
can increase the chance of disease control and decrease the
chance of cancer cells becoming increasingly malignant
and incurable. Also, in some cases, the dose requirement
of each agent in combination therapy can be reduced,
which reduces the side-effects compared to monotherapy,
albeit some combination therapies have been shown to
increase toxicity [190, 191]. An additional advantage
of combination therapy is that multiple drugs can target
the heterogeneous nature of tumours, correspondingly
increasing the chance of killing all cancer cells, including
the cancer stem cell population that is known to contribute
to drug resistance and cancer recurrence after remission in
later years [192-194].
It should be noted, however, that studies have also
revealed some disadvantages of combination therapy use
in cancer. Firstly, the combination of multiple agents can
synergistically or additively create therapeutic benefits,
but can equally produce unwanted side-effects [191].
This can make it difficult to identify the responsible
agent and as a result, it would be difficult to assess which
agent’s dose should be lowered. If the therapeutic agents
act similarly, where their side-effect profiles are similar,
the accumulation of side-effects can create more severe
clinical symptoms and grade 3/4 toxicities that can
severely impact and alter the patient’s life expectancy. As
an example, in a phase I/II study performed by Berdeja
et al, the combination of panobinostat and carfilzomib
resulted in treatment-related heart failure (2%), while
treatment-related death rose (2%) in patients with
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma [195]. Obviously,
complications from combination therapies can create
further problems for patients in terms of financial and
general well-being. Drug interaction should be thoroughly
considered when creating a combination therapy regimen
for cancer [196]. For instance, one drug may inhibit
the metabolic activity of the secondary or tertiary
agent, formally leading to the buildup of toxicity which
consequently has a detrimental effect on the patient’s
health.
Combination therapies that include one or more
anti-cancer agents that target the pathways discussed
above, such as HDACi, CAi, 5-HT receptor inhibitors,
anti-angiogenic drugs, and pharmaceutical agents
targeting antioxidant pathways may display promising
results in cancer research. This is evident as the PubMed
database has displayed many results when using the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

keywords: histone deacetylase inhibitors, HDACi,
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, 5-HT receptor inhibitors,
5-HT inducers, 5-HT agents, autocrine growth factor
inhibitors, anti-angiogenics, Nrf2 inducers and Nrf2
inhibitors. It is particularly important to understand the
interactions between two or more anti-cancer agents in
a combination regimen to create the maximum efficacy
with the least amount of toxicity. There are many possible
agents that can combine to potentially result in significant
therapeutic efficacy, but that have not yet entered into
full investigation. For example, although bevacizumab
has shown promising anti-angiogenic activity, it does
not inhibit the interaction between VEGF RTKs and
neuropilin-1 (NRPs), which are contributing factors to
cancer stem cell survival [197]. VEGF/NRP cellular
signaling has also shown to contribute to tumour cell
survival by inducing the PI3K-AKT pathway, an important
pathway in tumour cell survival [198]. There have been
limited studies investigating the combination of agents
that target both of these angiogenic factors. With such
knowledge, it is reasonable to search for a combination
therapy regimen that includes the targeting of VEGF and
NRP interaction, while simultaneously displaying antiVEGF activity in order to contribute to the most promising
result.

CONCLUSION
Our review demonstrates that therapeutic agents
currently on the market are being used in combination
therapies that have either completed their clinical
evaluations, are still in progress, or warrant prospective
clinical trials. In terms of economic benefits, repurposed
therapeutic agents tailored to cancer treatment have
demonstrated promising results in the clinical setting
and have gained attention from oncologists worldwide...
Combination therapies that involve a repurposed
therapeutic agent have also demonstrated enhanced
efficacy and efficiency. Notably, drug repositioning
passes toxicity and safety profiles, and when used in
combination treatments shows enhanced efficacy in an
additive or synergistic manner, potentially also reducing
drug resistance.
