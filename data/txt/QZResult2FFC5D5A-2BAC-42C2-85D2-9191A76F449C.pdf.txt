control over proliferation, migration, metastasis, apoptosis, and
angiogenesis. Such a pan PI3K inhibitor, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8phenyl-4H-1benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) was reported by Vlahos
over 10 years ago (1) and shown to block all classes of PI3K with the
following IC50 values: (a) p110a, 720 nmol/L; (b) p110h, 306 nmol/L;
(c) p110g, 1.6 Amol/L; and (d) p110y, 1.33 Amol/L (2, 3). It also
inhibits a number of other PI3Ks, such as mTOR and DNAPK at
similar levels. Over 3,000 peer-reviewed publications have described
a large number of physiologic effects of this inhibitor on numerous
components of mammalian signaling. It has been shown in a
number of in vivo models to possess antitumor activity but suffers
from poor pharmacokinetics (4), poor water solubility, and
undesirable toxicity. The systemic administration of the pan PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 results in potent antitumor and antiangiogenic
activity in vivo (5, 6). Considering the published literature using this
compound and its desirable inhibition properties, we were
motivated to explore targeted conjugates that would overcome
the limitations and provide for a desirable inhibitory profile.
Herein, we report the development of a clinically viable pan
PI3K inhibitor, SF1126 for therapeutic application in cancer. We
describe chemical methods which result in the conversion of the
research compound LY294002, termed SF1101, to a well-tolerated
water-soluble antitumor agent in vivo. The chemical design
combines a targeting group which is an RGDS peptide–linked
integrin-targeted (avh3/a5h1 targeted) linked to a small molecule
inhibitor which inhibits all members of the PI3K family (termed
pan PI3K inhibitor). The preclinical development of a pan PI3K
inhibitor compared with an isoform-specific inhibitor is supported by our desire to gain a greater therapeutic effect on a
larger number of survival, proliferative, and/or angiogenic
signaling pathways downstream of multiple redundant cell
surface receptors (7). There are eight known mammalian PI3Ks
divided into three classes based on structure, function, and
substrate specificity (8). For a cancer treatment paradigm, we
sought to target all members of the PI3K family, including class Ia
and Ib isoforms. We describe the evaluation of pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamic, antitumor, and antiangiogenic activity in vivo
of SF1126 demonstrating marked improvement over the parental
compound LY294002.

Abstract
PTEN and the pan phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor
2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1benzopyran-4-one (LY294002)
exert significant control over tumor-induced angiogenesis
and tumor growth in vivo. The LY294002 compound is not a
viable drug candidate due to poor pharmacologic variables
of insolubility and short half-life. Herein, we describe the
development and antitumor activity of a novel RGDS-conjugated LY294002 prodrug, termed SF1126, which is designed to
exhibit increased solubility and bind to specific integrins
within the tumor compartment, resulting in enhanced delivery
of the active compound to the tumor vasculature and tumor.
SF1126 is water soluble, has favorable pharmacokinetics, and
is well tolerated in murine systems. The capacity of SF1126 to
inhibit U87MG and PC3 tumor growth was enhanced by the
RGDS integrin (AvB3/A5B1) binding component, exhibiting
increased activity compared with a false RADS-targeted
prodrug, SF1326. Antitumor activity of SF1126 was associated
with the pharmacokinetic accumulation of SF1126 in tumor
tissue and the pharmacodynamic knockdown of phosphorylated AKT in vivo. Furthermore, SF1126 seems to exhibit both
antitumor and antiangiogenic activity. The results support
SF1126 as a viable pan PI3K inhibitor for phase I clinical trials
in cancer and provide support for a new paradigm, the
application of pan PI3K inhibitory prodrugs for the treatment
of cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):206–15]

Introduction
The PI3K pathway is a target of significant interest in human
cancer due to the high frequency and broad spectrum of aberrations
in the pathway observed in human tumors. Multiple efforts are
under way in academia and industry to develop clinically relevant
inhibitors of this signaling pathway. To inhibit all classes of PI3K is
to potentially take a larger percentage of these elements of tumor
survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis out. Hence, we sought to
develop a clinically viable small molecule inhibitor against all
isoforms of PI3K (pan PI3K inhibitor). This manipulation, if
successful, would be tantamount to the inhibition of a larger
number of cell surface receptors, which would exert a powerful

collection, for each of the various time points outlined in the protocol at
13,000 rpm for 5 min in a Micromax 100 Centrifuge. A 100 AL aliquot of
plasma was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 100 AL of 50%
methanol in water acidified with 2% glacial acetic acid and phosphoric acid.
The samples were then snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and transferred to
a 80jC storage for later analysis of drug concentration. Tumor samples
were collected at specific time points and flash frozen for later analysis. The
analysis was performed using liquid chromatography with single-ion mass
spectrometric detection (Shimadzu 2010 LCMS) for the individual species at
308 and 427 with 10% to 60% acetonitrile water gradient and 100 AL
injection volume.
Animals for in vivo studies. Athymic female mice (CD-1 nu/nu,
20–25 g) were used for all of the in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.
Mice were purchased from Harlan or obtained from the NIH National
Cancer Institute repository and housed in on a 12-h light/dark cycle with
food and water ad libitum under specific pathogen-free conditions,
according to the guidelines of the Association for the Assessment and
Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International. All of the in vivo
studies were carried out under approved institutional experimental animal
care and use protocols.
Tumor implantation. U87MG, U251MG glioma, or PC3 prostate cancer
cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The
U251MG and LN229 glioma cell lines, stably transduced with the vIII
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant, were prepared as
described (9). The LN229 glioma cell line and LN229 cells transduced with
a reporter plasmid containing six copies of the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) promoter [hypoxic response element (HRE)–linked to the
firefly luciferase reporter; provided by Dr. Erwin Van Meir; ref. 10].
Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37jC in an incubator
with 5% CO2.
Treatment of mice with SF1126 and SF1326. Animals bearing tumors
of f100 mm3 in size were randomized into three groups receiving either
vehicle (acidified sterile water diluent for SF1126 or SF1326), SF1126, or
SF1326 via s.c. administration on the left flank for 3 weeks at a dose of
50 mg/kg and a frequency of thrice weekly. No untoward effects were noted
in mice treated with SF1126, SF1326, or vehicle. Measurement of tumor
volumes was performed in three coordinates using calipers.
Biochemical analysis. Evaluation of effect of PI3K inhibitors on AKT
and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) activity. U937 cells and baboon
endothelial cells (5–10  106) in 10% FBS-PBS were treated with 10 Amol/L
of SF1101, SF1126 (with RGD targeting moiety), and SF1326 (RAD-targeted
prodrug derivative) for 30 min with gentle shaking with or without prepulse
of 50 Amol/L RGD peptide (Biomol Research Lab., Inc.) for 15 min as
indicated in the individual experiments. At the end of treatment, cells were
solubilized with lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCL (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 100 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.05% NP40, 1%
aprotinin, 0.01 mg/mL leupeptin, and 0.08 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride] for Western blots. AKT kinase assays were performed using the
AKT1/protein kinase B (PKB), an immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit
(Upstate Biotechnology) following the instructions of the manufacturer as
described (11).
HIF-1A transcription activity. To determine the effects of SF1126 on
HIF-1a function, we used the LN229 glioma cell line, which is stably
transduced with four copies of the VEGF HRE promoter sequence upstream
of the firefly luciferase gene (4  HRE VEGF HRE; ref. 10). The HRE
response element is induced under hypoxic conditions (1% O2 for 4 h),
resulting in a robust activation of HIF-1a transcription activity (6-fold
induction). The LN229 glioma cells were treated with SF1126 at
concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 Amol/L for 15 min before placing
cells into hypoxic chamber (1% O2) for 4 h at 37jC.
CD31 immunohistochemistry. At the end of the efficacy studies,
tumors were harvested and placed in optimum cutting temperature blocks
for frozen section analysis or fixed in 10% buffered formalin and/or
processed into paraffin. Sections of tumor tissue at 4-Am thickness were
stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody for detection of the murine
tumor microvasculature (12).

Results
The pan PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has potent antitumor and
antiangiogenic activities in vivo (5, 6). A further analysis of the
chemical, pharmacokinetic, and toxicologic properties of LY294002
suggested that it would not be a viable drug (4). Hence, we set out
to develop a clinically viable tumor-targeted prodrug form of
LY294002/SF1101 that would be water soluble ( for facile clinical
administration) and would have a more favorable pharmacokinetic
and safety profile and hence have greater anticancer efficacy.
The LY294002/SF1101 compound has very poor water solubility
(200 Amol/L) with a cLogP value of +2.6 (1). The RGDS-conjugated
and RADS-conjugated prodrugs, termed SF1126 and SF1326,
respectively, were prepared using a solid phase synthesis approach
(Fig. 1). A solid phase organic synthesis procedure was established,
and a biophysical characterization of the SF1126 and SF1326
compounds was performed and yielded very similar profiles for (a)
water solubility profile (45 wt.%), (b) cleavage to the active moiety
(Fig. 2), and (c) cLogP ( 4.6).5 It should be noted that SF1126 has
no detectable PI3K inhibitory activity until hydrolyzed to SF1101,
which is in line with the known structure-activity relationship
known to be very sensitive to substitutions of the morpholino
group (1).
The SF1126 and SF1326 prodrug compounds were designed to
remain stable at acidic pH (pH < 5) and to spontaneously hydrolyze
at physiologic pH. The spontaneous cleavage of SF1126 (Fig. 2A) or
SF1326 (Fig. 2B) was determined at pH 7.0 in vitro. Importantly, the
cleavage rate and extent to which the SF1101 active compound was
liberated in vitro from SF1126 versus SF1326 was almost identical
between the two compounds (compare A to B). The pharmacokinetics of SF1126 given by three different routes (i.m., i.v., or s.c.)
was then determined as shown in Fig. 2C. It should be noted that
Fig. 2C depicts the plasma levels of active PI3K inhibitor SF1101/
LY294002. The results show that the prodrug SF1126 provides for
a significant increase in plasma half-life of SF1101/LY294002 after
the in vivo administration of SF1126 by multiple routes, especially
the s.c. administration route. The parental SF1101/LY294002
compound has a plasma half-life of <15 min (4) compared with
the extended release of SF1101 from SF1126, which is observed
with a half life of >1 h. In the same mice, we determined the effects
of each mode of administration on plasma glucose levels (D) as the
PI3K pathway mediates the effects of signaling through the insulin
receptor and also modulates the GLUT1/4 transporter translocation to the cell membrane to enable glucose uptake. A transient
pharmacodynamic effect of SF1126 was observed on plasma
glucose, which lasts for f2 h and spontaneously resolves by 3 to
4 h (Fig. 2D). These results provide evidence that our targeting
strategy has improved the pharmacokinetic profile for the delivery
of SF1101 and potentially suggest that the plasma glucose increase
observed shortly after a therapeutic dose of SF1126 may serve as
initial pharmacodynamic variable to follow in patients as we enter
phase 1 clinical trials.
Because SF1126 has an RGDS-targeting moiety, the inhibitory
effects of this drug in cell-based assays with limited exposure
times should be at least partially blocked by the prepulsing with
RGD peptide by virtue of occupying the RGDS-binding sites of
the avh3/avh5 and a5h1. Hence, we have studied the effect of

RGDS on SF1101/LY294002 or SF1326 is minimal, if any. The effect
of PI3K inhibition by SF1101, SF1126, and SF1326 was studied using
levels of phosphorylated Ser473-AKT and in vitro AKT kinase as
readouts in both human myeloid cell lines and primate primary
endothelial cells (Fig. 3). Figure 3A shows that a 10 Amol/L concentration of SF1126 or SF1101/LY294002 inhibited p-AKT (under
standard serum conditions, 10% FBS) as determined by Western
blot. The data show that AKT kinase activity was significantly
blocked (>25-fold) after the treatment of 10 Amol/L of SF1101/
LY294002, SF1126, or SF1326 (Fig. 3C). From these data, we
conclude that the RGDS targeting module contributes to the
pharmacodynamic activity of this prodrug.
The marked difference in the AKT inhibitory activity of SF1126
versus SF1326 under conditions where we pretreated with RGDS
peptide in vitro led us to design a series of in vivo experiments
comparing SF1126, at equivalent doses and timing, with the false
targeted SF1326 compound in two different in vivo xenograft
models for antitumor efficacy. We sought to determine if efficacy
would correlate with tumor delivery of SF1101/LY294002 in vivo.
The results show that SF1126 displays a greatly enhanced in vivo
efficacy against a glioma subcutaneous xenograft model (U87MG
cell line) versus SF1326, the ‘‘false-targeted’’ version of SF1126
(Fig. 4A and D). In other experiments, we show that treatment of
tumor-bearing mice with an equimolar amount of RGDS moiety
of SF1126, termed SF1174, has no significant antitumor activity
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S3). SF1126 displayed greater antitumor activity compared with SF1326 against the prostate cancer
cell line (PC-3) in nude mice (Fig. 4B). The results show marked
single agent antitumor efficacy of the SF1126 compared with
SF1326. SF1126 reduced tumor growth by 76% versus 23%
reduction noted with SF1326. Tumor growth remained depressed
for substantial period after cessation of treatment regimen. We

prepulsing of RGDS peptide on the inhibition of phosphorylated
AKT (p-AKT; levels of p-AKT and in vitro AKT kinase activity)
after treatment with SF1101/LY294002, SF1126, and SF1326. We
performed a prepulsing of cells with RGDS peptide for 15 min
to occupy all available receptors, followed by brief washing,
followed by a 20-min pulse with SF1101, SF1126, or SF1326,
followed by washing, and then prepared lysates to examine
pharmacodynamic effects. The data show that the inhibition of
p-AKT after SF1126 treatment was blocked by the prepulse of
50 Amol/L of RGDS peptide for 15 min in both U937 cells and
primate-derived endothelial cells (Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, a
pulse of RGDS peptide before treatment with SF1101/LY294002 or
SF1326 failed to block the inhibition of p-AKT. Interestingly, the
RADS conjugate SF1326 is not affected by preincubation with
RGDS however short pulses with SF1326 do result in significant
inhibition of p-AKT, a result which suggests that the RADS
conjugate may associate with cell surface receptors in an RGDSindependent manner. From these data, we conclude that SF1126
has a potent PI3K inhibitory effect (as observed by the inhibition of
AKT phosphorylation) as it converts from SF1126 to SF1101/
LY294002. The fact that this inhibitory action of SF1126 can be
specifically blocked by a prepulse of RGDS peptide confirms that
the activity of SF1126 under these conditions is at least partly
dependent upon the RGDS peptide moiety binding to cells. To
further confirm the importance of the RGDS targeting moiety on
SF1126 on tumor cells, we used a more sensitive in vitro kinase
assay for AKT kinase suppression. Unlike the p-AKT Western blot
that shows only a dynamic range of 2-fold to 3-fold, the in vitro
kinase assay shows a 10,000-fold difference in the presence of
SF1126. The capacity of SF1126 to suppress the in vitro kinase
activity of AKT in U937 cells is blocked 90% compared with a 5%
inhibition in the presence of RGDS. Comparatively, the effect of

and that the SF1126 selectively accumulates within the tumor
tissue. The amount of SF1101 found in the tumor is statistically
more by a factor of 2 after administration of SF1126 when
compared with the administration of SF1326 in tumor-bearing
mice (Fig. 4C).
In both tumor models, the increased efficacy associated with
SF1126 versus SF1326 was directly correlated with augmented
levels of the SF1101/LY294002 observed within the tumor tissue, a
result which provides in vivo evidence for the capacity of SF1126
to deliver more drug to the tumor site (2-fold increase; Fig. 4C).
SF1126 showed significantly improved in vivo efficacy (inhibition of
tumor growth) versus the false-targeted SF1326 (P = 0.0025)
although both were effective relative to the control group
(P < 0.0001 and P = 0.005, respectively). It should be noted that
both SF1126 and SF1326 differ only in an alanine substitution for
glycine in the tetrapeptide piece (Fig. 1) and convert at the same
rate to release the same amount of the SF1101/LY294002 PI3K
inhibitor (Fig. 2). This remarkable difference in one methyl group
encodes the RGD recognition receptor-binding ability to avh3/
a5h1 integrin of SF1126 in vivo. After the initiation of SF1126
therapy, PC3 prostate tumor tissue samples were obtained for
reverse-phase protein array analysis as described (13) and
processed to detect levels of p-AKT, S6 kinase, and phosphorylated

have also shown that SF1126 has marked antitumor activity in
other glioma models, LN229 and LN229vIII, and xenograft
models, U251 and U251vIII (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figs. S1B,
C and S4).
We performed liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of plasma and tumor tissue to quantitate tissue levels of these
inhibitors in an effort to correlate tumor response to enhanced
tumor uptake. The results show that unlike the parental SF1101/
LY294002 molecule (which has a half life of <10 min; not shown),
the SF1126 prodrug has a plasma half-life of 1 to 2 h and releases
the SF1101 active moiety into plasma and tumor compartment
over a period of 2 to 4 h (Fig. 4C). By measuring the amount of
SF1101 found in the tumor at 2-h postinjection, we show that the
tumor uptake of SF1126 is increased by a factor of 6-fold or 4-fold
in U87MG versus PC3 tumors, respectively, above serum levels
2 h after s.c. administration of the prodrug consistent with the
capacity of SF1126 to target the tumor site preferentially over
systemic levels for at least 2 h. It should be noted that tumor
concentrations of SF1101 approximating 30 Amol/L are observed at
2 h postinjection of 50 mg/kg of SF1126. These concentrations are
well above the enzymatic IC50 values for all PI3K isoforms. From
these data, we concluded that SF1126 has a favorable pharmacokinetic and chemical profile for further testing in vitro and in vivo

Pan PI3K Inhibitor Prodrug for Cancer Therapy

It has been suggested that tumors, which are transformed via the
activation of the PI3K signaling axis, may be more sensitive to
inhibitors of this pathway (16–18). This notion is supported by
both laboratory and clinical observations, wherein tumors which
have incurred mutations, for example, in EGFR or FLT3, are
more sensitive to inhibitors of these receptor tyrosine kinases. To
address this important question, we used isogenic tumor cell lines
manipulated in different ways to display activation of PI3K-AKT to
examine this important question, including (a) DOV13 ovarian
carcinoma cell line transduced with activated p110a or myristoylated AKT and (b) LN229 glioma cells stably transduced with
empty vector versus the mutated EGFR vIII (9). These different cell
lines activated directly or indirectly for PI3K-AKT signaling were
evaluated in vitro or in vivo for sensitivity to SF1126 (Fig. 6).
DOV13 cells transduced with activated p110a p110CAAX were more
sensitive to SF1126 than were the caAKT-transduced or parental
p110a wild-type cell lines (Fig. 6A). Finally, the LN229 were
compared in vivo to LN229 vIII cells for sensitivity to SF1126. The
results show a 3-fold greater response of LN229 vIII tumors to SF1126
compared with the parental LN229 cell line (Fig. 6C versus B). The
LN229 vIII displays a 4-fold increase in baseline p-AKT compared
with LN229 cells (Fig. 6D; ref. 9). Interestingly, both p-AKT and
phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase are suppressed
by SF1101 and SF1126 in LN229 cells. A similar observation was

obtained 12 h after the last injection with SF1126 versus vehicle
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). The results of these experiments show
significant pharmacodynamic knockdown of p-AKT (2-fold to
3-fold reduction in p-AKT) in the SF1126-treated tumors.
To further evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of SF1126 in
another tumor model, we examined its activity in the MDA-MB-468
orthotopic mouse mammary tumor model (Fig. 5). MDA-MB-468
human breast carcinoma cells were injected into the mammary fat
pad of nude mice. Mice were treated with 25 or 50 mg/kg/dose of
SF1126 thrice weekly. Next, because the PI3K-AKT signaling axis is a
known regulator of the GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4, known glucose
transporters in mammalian cells (15), we used 18FDG–positron
emission tomography (PET) imaging to evaluate the long-term
effects of SF1126 on MDA-468 tumors. The MDA-MB-468 orthotopic
mammary tumor model was used to determine if FDG-PET imaging
could serve as a noninvasive surrogate marker for response to
SF1126. Mice implanted with MDA-MB-468 tumors were treated for
3 weeks with SF1126 (25 or 50 mg/kg/dose MWF dosing; Fig. 5A).
No increase in activity was noted at the higher dose, possibly
indicating that the maximum biological effective dose is 25 mg/kg.
At the end of treatment regimen, mice were given an injection of
SF1126, and 18FDG-PET imaging was performed 2 h later (Fig. 5B).
The effects of SF1126 on tumor growth in this instance can be
measured and quantitated by this imaging modality (Fig. 5C).

Pan PI3K Inhibitor Prodrug for Cancer Therapy

SF1126 in 6 of 11 xenograft models (data not shown) shows
potent inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo.
Previous observations from our laboratory and other investigators suggest that pan PI3K inhibitors will sensitize tumor cells to
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation (9, 22–28). To test this idea
in vivo, we investigated the antitumor activity of combining pan
PI3K inhibition with a cytotoxic agent targeting the tubulin/
microtubule system taxotere (Supplementary Fig. S4). PC3 tumors
treated with taxotere at 6 mg/kg/dose  3 doses show reduced rate
of growth compared with untreated control mice as do animals
treated with SF1126 alone. PC3 tumors treated with a combination
of taxotere followed by SF1126 show dramatic induction of tumor
regression to an almost undetectable tumor volume by day 67.

shown to regulate the transcription factor HIF-1a, a control point
for the hypoxic induction of VEGF (19–21). As mentioned above,
the SF1126 is RGD targeted to angiogenic integrins avh3, avh5,
and a5h1; hence, it might be expected that this targeted prodrug
will display antiangiogenic activity. To investigate the effects of
the SF1126 on angiogenesis, we evaluated its effects on the
hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1a and on HIF-1a transcription
under hypoxic conditions in glioma cells. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2, the results show that SF1126 blocks
HIF-1a accumulation and profoundly inhibits HIF-1a transcription activity in LN229 glioma cells (90% suppression). Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of SF1126 on the capacity of LN229
vIII tumor cells to recruit a blood supply in vivo during thrice
weekly of treatments with SF1126 at 50 mg/kg (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). A quantitation of microvessel density in control versus
SF1126-treated tumors showed a 72% decrease in MVD in
SF1126*treated tumors, suggesting that this treatment has
significant antiangiogenic properties in vivo. The antiangiogenic
activity of SF1126 correlates with a block in the HIF-1a–VEGF
signaling in the tumor cell. Moreover, an analysis of the effects of

Discussion
The class Ia and Ib PI3Ks are all involved in the regulation of a
large number of important signaling events downstream of the
PI3K-AKT kinase cascade including, but not restricted to, (a) mdm2p53 axis (6), (b) IKKa–nuclear factor-nB pathway (29), (c) PAR-4

Figure 6. PI3K pathway activation predicts response to SF1126 therapy. We used isogenic tumor cell lines engineered to have greater activation of the PI3K or
AKT signaling pathway to test the hypothesis that pathway activation/addiction makes tumors more sensitive to PI3K pathway inhibition by SF1126. A, DOV13, a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, was stably transduced with empty vector, p110CAAX, or caAKT. Sensitivity to apoptosis was examined in vitro for all three cell lines
under conditions of SF1126 treatment. B and C, LN229 versus LN229 vIII as described above were implanted into nude mice. Biochemical analysis of PI3K-AKT
signaling axis (9) confirms 3-fold to 4-fold augmentation in p-AKT in the LN229 vIII versus LN229 (D ). Growth rate of tumors in vivo was significantly different.
The relative response to SF1126 therapy was compared at 25 mg/kg/dose given MWF.

into DOV13 cells, does not impart increased SF1126 sensitivity.
Therefore, the upstream activation of PI3K or direct mutational
activation of p110a results in cells which are more sensitive to
pan PI3K inhibition. Finally, we introduced into LN229 glioma
cells the EGFR vIII mutant receptor, which results in the
constitutively activation of the PI3K pathway (9). The results
suggest that the upstream activation of AKT via the mutated
EGFR vIII as seen in GBM tumors results in more marked
response to SF1126 in vivo.
Previous work from our laboratory established that the SF1101/
LY294002 compound targets both the tumor and the stromal
endothelial compartments (6). Because SF1126 is RGD-targeted to
avh3 and a5h1 expressed on both endothelial and tumor cells, it
was hypothesized that this agent might exert part of its antitumor
activity based on its effects on the tumor microenvironment.
Others have observed an effect of LY294002 on VEGF, HIF-1a, and
p53 in the context of antiangiogenesis (6, 21, 24). Based on these
prior results, we were interested in testing the SF1126 compound
for antiangiogenic activity. Our results show that SF1126 has potent
antiangiogenic activity in six different xenograft models tested thus
far. To further study the action of SF1126 on angiogenesis, we
examined its effect on a known positive regulator of tumor-induced
angiogenesis, the HIF-1a transcription factor. We measured the
hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1a protein in LN229 glioma cells by
Western blot analysis. To further confirm this observation, we
examined HIF-1a HRE-dependent transcription under hypoxic
conditions. Similar results were observed with SF1126 treatment of
glioma cells. From these data, we conclude that the PI3K pathway
controls the hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1a in glioma cells.
Moreover, both LY294002 and SF1126 block the hypoxic induction
of HIF-1a transcription activity in these glioma cells. The
mechanism by which PI3K or AKT regulate the hypoxic stability
of HIF-1a is unclear (19). Preliminary evidence from our studies
suggest that PI3K inhibitors may block the pathway by which
HIF-1a is degraded under hypoxic conditions because MG132
blocks the effect of SF1126 on HIF-1a under hypoxic conditions
(not shown).
In summary, we conclude that (a) SF1126 has potent antitumor
activity against multiple human tumor types in vivo, (b) SF1126 has
a favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effect on its
target as indicated by inhibition of the downstream kinase, AKT
in vitro and in vivo, (c) the RGD targeting moiety plays an
important role in its in vivo and in vitro activity, and (d) SF1126 is
well tolerated in mouse, rat, and canine models (data not shown).
Moreover, we suggest that (a) FDG-PET should be evaluated in
clinical trials to follow the therapeutic and pharmacodynamic
response to PI3K inhibitor therapy in vivo, (b) tumor biopsies can
be used to determine the degree of pathway inhibition potentially
allowing dose modification or augmenting dose finding studies,
(c) tumors with an activated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway are
likely to be more sensitive to SF1126 potentially allowing for the
enrichment of patients likely to respond in clinical trials, (d)
SF1126 inhibits the hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1a signaling axis in
tumor cells and is potently antiangiogenic in vivo suggesting an
effect on the tumor microenvironment, and (e) SF1126 augments
the antitumor activity of taxotere in a prostate cancer xenograft
model. These combined results strongly suggest that SF1126
warrants testing as a single agent in human phase I/phase II
clinical trials and subsequently in combinations with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A clinical trial of SF1126 is now
under way.

apoptotic pathway (30, 31), (d) BAD phosphorylation (32), (e)
Myc via GSK3 and MIZ1 phosphorylation (33), ( f ) MDM2 (23–25),
(g ) 14-3-3 interaction with phosphorylated BAD, (h) RAF via PAK
kinase (34), (i) TSC2-RHEB-mTOR-RS6 kinase (32), ( j) Forkhead
transcription factor (35), (k) ASK1 phosphorylation by AKT (36), and
(l) p27 kip1 regulation (37). Thus, PI3K represents an important
nodal point for the convergence of multiple cell surface receptors,
which then leads to the downstream activation of multiple serine/
threonine kinase cascades and the activation of multiple transcription factors.
It has been suggested that an important component of
successful application of PI3K inhibitors to cancer therapeutics
will be the capacity to measure the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic effects of these agents in vivo. To this end, we
have developed methods which allow us to quantitate SF1126/
SF1101 concentrations in tumor tissue and plasma and to measure
pharmacodynamic knockdown responses in tumor using biochemical and noninvasive PET imaging. The results show the capacity of
SF1126 to affect a sustained knockdown of p-AKT and phosphorylated RS6 kinase for up to 12 h after the administration of this
drug. To date, a limited number of preclinical studies with PTK
inhibitors, e.g., Tarceva, have carefully examined the relationship
between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic knockdown of
the target in tumor tissue (38). In some studies, a sustained
knockdown of the target kinase activity is observed after the
administration of kinase inhibitors despite a plasma and tumor
half-life of this agent of 2 to 4 h (38). Hence, the relationship
between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects for a
number of targeted therapeutic agents remains to be determined.
The observed sustained knockdown of p-AKT and phosphorylated
S6 kinase after a single dose of SF1126 supports the observed
efficacy of SF1126 when given in an every other day schedule.
It is clear from the literature that multiple tumor types exhibit
activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling axis either by PTEN loss
or by incurring mutations in PIK3CA gene (39). We have now
tested SF1126 against 11 different tumor cell lines representing
seven different tumor lineages in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Importantly, SF1126 displays significant single-agent antitumor
activity against multiple glioblastoma cell lines, as well as
prostate and breast cancer xenografts. We have determined
activity of SF1126 against renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma,
neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (Supplementary Fig. S5).5
Importantly, SF1126, when combined with taxotere in a prostate
cancer model (Supplementary Fig. S4), displays augmented
antitumor activity in vivo. These results support the current
focus, which is to use targeted therapeutic agents to modulate
chemoradiosensitivity in cancer. In this way, SF1126, by virtue of
its capacity to shut off a large number of downstream survival
and proliferative signals in both tumor and stromal compartment,
is an attractive signal modulator for other cytotoxic and genotoxic
stressors.
It has been suggested by a number of investigators that tumors
addicted to a specific biochemical pathway for growth, angiogenesis, and survival will display increased sensitivity to the inhibitors
which attack this pathway (16, 17). We used isogenic tumor cell
lines where the PTEN–PI3K-AKT axis is activated by different
genetic manipulations to test in vitro or in vivo sensitivity to
SF1126. The introduction of activated p110a catalytic subunit into
DOV13 ovarian carcinoma cell line makes them more sensitive to
SF1126 inhibitory activity in vitro. The transduction of activated
myristoylated AKT, which is independent of PI3K for its activation
