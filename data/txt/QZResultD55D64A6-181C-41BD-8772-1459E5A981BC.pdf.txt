BACKGROUND: A study was conducted to determine the 5-year recurrence-free survival in patients with high-risk
prostate cancer after neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy followed by surgery. Secondary endpoints included
safety, pathologic effects of chemotherapy, and predictors of disease recurrence. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients
were enrolled in a phase 1/2 study of weekly docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and escalating mitoxantrone to 4 mg/m2 before
prostatectomy. Patients were treated with 16 weeks of chemotherapy administered weekly on a 3 of every 4 week
schedule. A tissue microarray, constructed from the prostatectomy specimens, served to facilitate the exploratory
evaluation of biomarkers. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. Disease recurrence was defined as a
confirmed serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >0.4 ng/mL. RESULTS: Of the 57 patients, 54 received 4 cycles of
docetaxel and mitoxantrone before radical prostatectomy. Grade 4 toxicities were limited to leukopenia, neutropenia,
and hyperglycemia. Serum testosterone levels remained stable after chemotherapy. Negative surgical margins were
attained in 67% of cases. Lymph node involvement was detected in 18.5% of cases. With a median follow-up of 63
months, 27 of 57 (47.4%) patients recurred. The Kaplan-Meier recurrence-free survival at 2 years was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.0%-78.0%) and was 49.8% at 5 years (95% CI, 35.5%-64.1%). Pretreatment serum PSA, lymph
node involvement, and postchemotherapy tissue vascular endothelial growth factor expression were independent
predictors of early recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemotherapy with docetaxel and mitoxantrone is feasible. Approximately half of the high-risk patients remain free of disease recurrence at 5 years, and clinical and molecuC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Recent advances have lead to improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer; however,

treatment failure after primary therapy occurs in 35% to 40% of cases.1,2 The implementation of risk stratification models
has allowed for the identification of prostate cancer patients who are at greatest risk for recurrence after primary therapy.3,4
After radical prostatectomy, disease recurrence may occur locally, at distant sites, or both.5,6 Effective systemic therapy regimens capable of eradicating microscopic metastases and improving local control are needed to improve the outlook for
patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer.
Randomized controlled trials of neoadjuvant androgen-suppressive therapy have shown that 3 months of preoperative androgen suppression significantly alters tumor phenotype and surgical margin status, but does not reduce the risk of
prostate cancer recurrence.7-9 Complete pathologic responses, a validated marker in other tumor types, have only rarely
been observed with androgen suppression alone. Longer androgen suppression before prostatectomy has not shown a clinical benefit to date.10 These results strongly suggest that castration-resistant prostate cancer clones are present at the time

of initial diagnosis. Therapeutic agents that are active
against disseminated prostate cancer, and in particular,
castration-resistant prostate cancer, are likely to be necessary to improve outcomes in high-risk localized prostate
cancer.
The use of systemic chemotherapeutic agents has
only recently become standard treatment for patients with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Mitoxantrone and docetaxel are both active in advanced prostate
cancer.11,12 The availability of active cytotoxic agents
stimulated their experimental application in combination
with surgery in high-risk prostate cancer patients.13 Preoperative treatment also has the unique advantage of
allowing assessment of tumor response and collection of
pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue for molecular
interrogation.
To date, several groups have tested the safety and
preliminary efficacy of preoperative taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with high-risk disease.14-18 These studies have consistently shown that taxanes can be safely
administered in the preoperative setting. In studies of single-agent docetaxel, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reductions were observed in the majority of patients, although
pathologic complete responses were not observed. The
addition of androgen suppression therapy to systemic taxane treatment has also been evaluated.16,18 In these studies, both PSA and pathologic changes have been typical of
the expected responses with hormonal therapies. It is
somewhat encouraging that, in a recent study by Chi et al,
complete pathologic responses were observed in 3% of
patients treated with a combination of androgen suppression and docetaxel.19 The contribution of chemotherapy
to this outcome is unclear, because it was studied in combination with hormonal therapy and not in isolation.
As docetaxel and mitoxantrone exert antitumor
effects through distinct cellular mechanisms, this combination has potential for synergistic activity against prostate cancer. On the basis of the experience with similar
agents in breast cancer, incomplete cross-resistance
between these 2 agents would be expected. Indeed, evidence suggests that docetaxel is active in patients previously exposed to mitoxantrone, and that mitoxantrone
retains some activity in patients whose cancer has progressed after docetaxel.20 On the basis of these lines of evidence, we developed a regimen that combines both of
these agents. Previously we reported the results of mitoxantrone dose escalation to 4 mg/m2 with a fixed dose of
docetaxel (35 mg/m2) in our initial phase 1 cohort. Here
we report the pathologic, biomarker, and clinical out-

comes for this multimodality approach to the treatment
of high-risk prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligibility criteria for this study included histologically
confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, prostatectomy
planned as primary therapy, 10-year minimum life expectancy, and at least 1 of the following high-risk features:
clinical stage T2c or surgically resectable T3a, or serum
PSA 15 ng/mL, or Gleason grade 4 þ 3 (ie, 4 þ 3,
4 þ 4, or any 5 elements). Additional requirements
included a negative radionuclide bone scan and a pelvic
computerized tomographic scan to rule out pelvic lymph
node involvement (computed tomography required only
in patients with a PSA 40 ng/mL), Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1, and
left ventricular ejection fraction 50% by multigated acquisition technetium scan. Exclusion criteria were any
prior therapy for prostate cancer, any significant active
medical illness, a second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer within 5 years, grade 2 peripheral
neuropathy, hypersensitivity to drugs formulated with
polysorbate-80, significant contraindications to corticosteroids, white blood cell count <3000/mm3, neutrophil
count <1500/mm3, platelet count <100,000/mm3, conjugated bilirubin >upper limit of normal (ULN), alkaline
phosphatase >4.0  ULN, and alanine transaminase
(ALT) >2.0  ULN or ALT >1.5  ULN concomitant
with alkaline phosphatase >2.5  ULN.
Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. The protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards of all participating institutions.
Treatment
Docetaxel was administered at a fixed dose of 35 mg/m2,
whereas mitoxantrone was dose escalated in the first 10
patients, who received mitoxantrone at doses of 2 to 5
mg/m2,14 and was given at a dose of 4 mg/m2 in all
remaining patients. Patients received 4 28-day cycles of
chemotherapy with docetaxel and mitoxantrone administered as 3 weekly doses followed by a 1-week break. Dexamethasone 4 mg was given orally 12 hours and 1 hour
before and 12 hours after treatment. In patients who
weighed >130% of their ideal body weight (IBW, defined
as 50 kg þ 2.3 kg/inch for each inch of height over 5
feet),21 body surface was calculated based on adjusted
weight, defined as IBW þ 0.5(actual weight  IBW).

Dose Modifications
Hematologic events

Scheduled doses with both chemotherapeutic agents
were withheld for platelet count <75,000/mm3 or neutrophil count <1000/mm3 until count levels recovered to
above these parameters. The mitoxantrone dose was
reduced by 25% if recovery took >1 week, if counts were
below these parameters for 2 consecutive doses, or for any
grade 4 hematologic toxicity. The dose of docetaxel was
reduced by 25% if a patient again met these criteria despite the mitoxantrone dose reduction. Patients who had a
platelet count <75,000/mm3, a neutrophil count <1000/
mm3 that persisted >2 weeks, or had any grade 4 hematologic toxicity despite the 25% dose reduction of both
agents received no additional chemotherapy. Hematologic growth factors were allowed at the treating physician’s discretion; however, growth factor support could
not serve as a replacement for the preplanned dose
reductions.
Nonhematologic events

The dose of docetaxel and mitoxantrone was to be
reduced by 25% for aspartate transferase of 1.6 to
5  ULN. Therapy was withheld for bilirubin > ULN,
alkaline phosphatase >5  ULN, or ALT >5  ULN.
Therapy was resumed at a 25% dose reduction in patients
whose liver function tests recovered within 3 weeks.
Mitoxantrone therapy was to be discontinued for any clinical evidence of cardiotoxicity that was associated with a
>10% decline in ejection fraction. For all other persistent
and clinically significant grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities, therapy was to be withheld until resolution of toxicity and treatment resumed with a 25% reduction in the
dose of both agents.
Patient Monitoring
At Week 1 of each 4-week cycle, a chemistry panel, PSA,
and complete blood count with automated differential
were collected. A complete blood count was also obtained
at week 2 and 3, during each drug treatment visit. Serum
testosterone was measured before chemotherapy and after
4 cycles of treatment. A physical examination and assessment of toxicity was performed every 4 weeks. Perioperative surgical morbidities, operative time, blood loss, and
pathologic findings were recorded in all patients. After
completion of chemotherapy and prostatectomy, patients
are to be observed with serum PSA tests every 3 months
and regular clinic visits for 5 years or until evidence of
recurrence.

Translational Studies
Pre- and postchemotherapy plasma vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) were measured. Tumor expression
of VEGF, nuclear Ki67, nuclear and cytoplasmic p16,
and CD10 were characterized in a tissue microarray constructed from formalin-fixed prostatectomy specimens.
Detailed methods for these analyses are provided below.
Methods
Patient samples

Before the initiation of chemotherapy, each patient
underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (10 cores) for translational studies. Fresh biopsy samples were embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting
temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura, Torrence, Calif)
and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then
transferred to a 80 C freezer. Plasma samples were
obtained at enrollment and before each cycle of chemotherapy and stored at 80 C. At prostatectomy, surgical
specimens were immediately placed in a sealed specimen
bag and placed on ice. Unfixed portions of both cancer
and noncancer tissue from the prostatectomy specimen
were identified by microscopic examination of frozen sections and rapidly frozen after embedding in OCT.
Tissue microarray

To facilitate the analysis of biomarker studies, a tissue microarray was constructed from each prostatectomy
specimen. Tissue cores were removed from the paraffinembedded blocks and placed in a master paraffin block
using a precision tissue arrayer (MTA-1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, Wis). Three cores each of prostate
cancer tissue, normal prostate, and where applicable,
lymph nodes with metastatic cancer were placed in the
master paraffin block. To determine the appropriate location to sample for these 3 tissue types, H & E slides of
each donor block were examined microscopically. Dispersed among the study cores were control tissues from
nonstudy patients (ie, liver, prostate, lymph node, salivary
gland, kidney, and testis tissue), and untreated prostate
cancer cell lines (DU-145, PC-3, LNCaP). After sample
placement, the master block was heated to 37 C for 30
minutes and then cut into 5-lm sections.
Immunohistochemistry

Slides were incubated overnight at 4 C in a humid
chamber with primary antibodies diluted in 0.3% bovine
serum albumin in tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1%
sodium azide (NaN3). Primary antibodies included anti-

1701

Original Article

Ki-67 (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz), p16
(Ventana Medical Systems), CD10 (Ventana Medical
Systems), and VEGF (1:200, Zymed, San Francisco,
Calif). Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by immersing the tissue microarray slides in 3% H2O2 in 80%
methanol with 0.1% NaN3 for 15 minutes. The slides
were then washed in 0.05% Tween in TBS (2  5
minutes), rinsed in TBS alone, and incubated with avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
Calif) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, the
slides were washed in 0.05% Tween in TBS (2  5
minutes), in TBS alone, and then incubated in 0.1% 3,30 diaminobenzidine solution (DAKO, Carpentaria, Calif).
The slides were counterstained with Gill hematoxylin for
1 minute, then rinsed in tap water until clear. The slides
were then dehydrated in graded alcohols and xylene, and
coverslipped. Positive and negative control cores were
examined to ensure the adequacy of staining. For Ki-67
and p16 assessment, the percentage of positively staining
nuclei was reported regardless of staining intensity. CD10
expression was scored using a semiquantitative intensity
scale. The 4-point scale (0-3) represented an overall level
of staining characterized as none, weak, moderate, or
strong by a pathologist; this was assessed separately for benign and neoplastic tissues. For tissue VEGF staining,
cancer and normal epithelial cells separately were each
assigned a score based on the number of cells stained
according to the following definition: 0 ¼ <5%,
1þ ¼ 6% to 25%, 2þ ¼ 26% to 75%, or 3þ ¼ 76% to
100%. As each patient was represented by 3 core samples on
the tissue microarray, an average score was then calculated.
Plasma VEGF assays

Pre- and postchemotherapy plasma VEGF levels
were quantified using a human VEGF Quantikine Immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, samples
were added to a microplate coated with a mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody. After an incubation period, the
samples were aspirated, the microwells were washed, and a
polyclonal conjugate against VEGF was applied. Samples
were again aspirated, and microwells were washed. The
optical density of each well was determined at 450 nm after addition of a substrate.
Findings
Tissue Ki-67 expression

The Ki-67 protein is a well-known marker of proliferation in cancer cells that has been shown to correlate

1702

with the biological behavior of clinical prostate cancer.22,23 The mean number of positive cancer cells was
5.6% (standard deviation [SD], 6.7%; range, 0%44.4%).
CD10 tissue expression

CD10 is a transmembrane zinc metallopeptidase
that mediates signal transduction and local concentrations
of peptide factors.24 The mean CD10 intensity score for
all patients was 1.32 (SD, 1.02; range, 0-3) in neoplastic
tissues and 2.70 (SD, 0.50; range, 1-3) in benign
epithelium.
p16 tissue expression

p16 is a member of the INK4a cell cycle inhibitor
protein family, which has significant prognostic capability
in several tumor types. Expression of nuclear p16 was seen
in 47.7% of cells in cancer tissue (SD, 33.2%; range, 0%100%) and 17.4% of cells in normal tissue (SD, 20.8%;
range, 0%-80%).
Tissue VEGF expression

VEGF, a promoter of angiogenesis, is frequently
overexpressed in prostate cancer, and its expression correlates with more advanced stage as well as higher Gleason
scores. The VEGF score averaged 2.46 in cancer tissue
(SD, 0.61%; range, 0.5-3) and 2.17 in normal tissue (SD,
0.74; range, 0-3).
Plasma VEGF levels

Considerable heterogeneity in plasma VEGF was
observed. Mean pretreatment VEGF was 78.6 pg/mL
(SD, 80.7; range, 10.6-314.7). Post-treatment VEGF was
97.6 pg/mL (SD, 110.1; range, 10.6-687.6). No statistically significant change in plasma VEGF with chemotherapy was seen.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint for this study was to determine 5year recurrence-free survival after combination chemotherapy and prostatectomy. Disease recurrence was
defined as the detection and confirmation of a serum PSA
>0.4 ng/mL or any other clinical evidence of disease or
initiation of any prostate cancer-directed therapy. Sample
size and power calculations were previously described.14
For exploratory outcomes analyses, Gleason scores
were categorized into either 3 categories (6 vs 7 vs 8 and
higher) or 2 categories (6 and 7 vs 8 and higher). Pathologic and clinical T classifications were each split into T12 versus T3-4. Continuous variables were dichotomized

into high and low groups based on median values. Nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 were split into groups with
greater or less than 20% staining. In addition, each of
these variables was analyzed after stratification for surgical
lymph node status. Pre- and postchemotherapy testosterone levels and serum VEGF levels were compared using a
t test for paired data. PSA fluctuations during chemotherapy were calculated by determining the percentage change
from baseline. Values that remained between þ20% and
20% from baseline were considered stable.
Time-dependent analyses were carried out using
the Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of covariates on
time-dependent outcome variables was examined using
the log-rank test in univariate analyses and the Cox
proportional hazards ratio in multivariate analyses. Predictor variables tested included patient age, lymph
node status, surgical margin status, biopsy Gleason
score, pathological Gleason score, clinical and pathologic T stage, cancer tissue VEGF percent intensity,
prechemotherapy plasma VEGF, baseline PSA, PSA
density (serum PSA/prostate volume), PSA pattern of
change on therapy, prostate volume, nuclear Ki67, nuclear and cytoplasmic p16, and CD10 staining.

RESULTS
Patients
Between January 2001 and November 2004, 57 patients
with high-risk localized prostate cancer were recruited
from the clinics at all study sites. All screened patients
were eligible. The median age was 63 years (range, 49-74
years). Median ECOG performance status was 0. The median serum PSA was 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.4-58.6 ng/
mL), and the median biopsy Gleason score was 8 (range,
6-10). The pretreatment characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The median follow-up for recurrence-free
patients was 63 months (range, 7-88 months). The median follow-up for all patients (until last visit or until recurrence) was 55 months (range, 7-88 months).
Treatment
Of the 57 patients, 54 completed 4 cycles of therapy and
had surgery. Two patients completed <4 cycles of therapy
before going on to surgery because of the following factors: 1 patient had persistent grade 2 nausea after 8 of 12
planned doses, and 1 patient developed grade 2 neuropathy after 9 of 12 planned doses of treatment. One patient
was incarcerated out of the reach of our healthcare system
and was lost to follow-up.

Among the 54 patients who received 4 cycles of therapy and had surgery, 218 of 228 (96%) doses of chemotherapy were delivered as scheduled. All 10 of the missed
doses were because of neutropenia. Four patients received
erythropoietin (40,000 U weekly) for anemia, and no
patient received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors.
Toxicity
Treatment-related toxicity for the entire 4-cycle course of
therapy is detailed in Table 2. Neutropenia was the most
common treatment-related hematologic toxicity. Hyperglycemia, expected with dexamethasone premedications,
and onycholysis, commonly reported with weekly docetaxel, were the most common nonhematologic toxicities.
One patient suffered a calf venous thrombosis below the
popliteal vein while receiving chemotherapy.
Surgery After Chemotherapy
Acknowledging the limitations of sample size as well as
variations in individual pelvic anatomy and in operative
technique among different surgeons, observed operative
morbidity was comparable to most published data for
prostatectomy without prior chemotherapy.25-27 In the
absence of direct measures of technical difficulty, we evaluated commonly used surrogates. The median operative

time was 4.3 hours (mean, 4.4 hours; range, 2.4-6.5
hours). The median estimated blood loss was 900 mL
(mean, 1023 mL; range, 80-3100). There was 1 intraoperative complication, a rectal injury that was thought to be
possibly related to chemotherapy. Postoperative complications were limited to a wound infection in 1 patient.
There were no postoperative deep venous thromboses.
Effect of Chemotherapy on Serum
Testosterone and PSA Values
To ensure that any changes in PSA or tumor characteristics were not because of an effect on androgenic steroid

1704

production, pre- and postchemotherapy testosterone
measurements were compared. There was no change in
testosterone with therapy; the mean serum testosterone
concentration was 343 ng/dL before therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 303.7-382.1 ng/dL) and 352 ng/dL
after therapy (95% CI, 304.7-399.3 ng/dL) (n ¼ 53,
P ¼ .71).
The use of PSA as an indirect measure of antitumor
activity was facilitated by the finding that therapy did not
result in reduced testosterone levels. Considerable fluctuation in individual PSA measurements were seen, and conventional measures developed in metastatic hormone-

refractory prostate cancer are not readily applicable in this
setting. Hence, we examined the overall effect on PSA in
each patient. Three distinct patterns emerged. The first
group (n ¼ 28, 52%) had a decreasing PSA pattern
defined as sustained decline >20%. The second group
(n ¼ 12, 22%) had PSA levels that neither increased nor
decreased by >20% during chemotherapy. The third
group (n ¼ 14, 26%) had both increases and decreases of
>20% from 1 time point to the next. No patient developed sustained PSA progression defined as a confirmed
increase of >20%.
Initial Surgical Outcome
Pathologic outcome at surgery is summarized in Table 3.
Negative margins were attained in 36 of 54 patients
(67%; 95% CI, 53%-79%). There were no pathologic
complete responses. Postoperative PSA was <0.2 ng/mL
in 43 of 54 patients (80%; 95% CI, 66%-89%).

Biomarker Studies
Biomarker results are presented in supplementary data.
Briefly, the expression of Ki-67, CD10, p16, and plasma
VEGF concentrations were not predictive of clinical outcomes, whereas postchemotherapy tissue VEGF expression was an independent predictor of early recurrence.

Cancer Recurrence
Twenty-seven of 57 (47.4%) patients have experienced
disease recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier progression-free
survival for the entire study group was 65.5% (95% CI,
53.0%-78.0%) at 2 years and 49.8% (95% CI, 35.5%64.1%) at 5 years. For lymph node-negative patients, 2and 5-year recurrence-free survival probabilities were
77.9% and 58.7%, respectively.
Independent predictors of disease recurrence are
shown in Table 4. Biopsy Gleason score, PSA density,
increased VEGF expression in surgical specimens, and
lymph node involvement with tumor were independently
associated with risk of recurrence. The profound effect of
persistent disease in lymph nodes is illustrated in Figure 1.
The effect of tissue VEGF expression is shown in Figure
2. Because the presence of disease in lymph nodes after
induction chemotherapy was a dominant predictor of outcome, we also examined predictors of recurrence in the
subset of patients who did not have lymph node involvement identified at surgery. Only tumor VEGF expression
after chemotherapy was associated with early recurrence
in this subset. PSA decline during chemotherapy was not
predictive of VEGF expression or time to recurrence.

DISCUSSION
Studies of androgen suppression therapy before surgery
have shown a near uniform resistance to androgen suppression illustrated by the presence of residual tumor in
pathologic specimens.7-9 Several groups have therefore

explored the use of chemotherapy before or after surgical
removal of the prostate.13,22
The regimen developed in this study combines the 2
most active chemotherapy drugs in prostate cancer and
was well tolerated and feasible in a multicenter study of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.
Patients who participated in our study were similar
to those who took part in other contemporary taxanebased treatment trials developed for high-risk, localized
prostate cancer.16,19 Negative surgical margins, a favorable
pathologic finding in men undergoing radical prostatectomy,23 were attained in 67% of our cases. These results
compared favorably to high-risk patients undergoing surgery alone, where the rates of negative margins range only
from 35% to 54%.7-9 Our negative margin rates in
patients treated with chemotherapy alone were comparable to the results obtained with chemohormonal treatment, where negative margin rates were 73% to 78%.16,19
Further studies are needed to determine whether preoperative cytotoxic chemotherapy has a direct role in improving surgical margin status. Positive lymph nodes were
detected in 18.5% of cases in our trial, compared with 6%
in 2 other chemohormonal neoadjuvant trials.16,19 There
were no pathologic complete responses in the current
study, a finding that has been observed in the majority of
other neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials.15-18
With a median follow-up of 63 months for nonrelapsing patients, the Kaplan-Meier progression-free sur-

vival rates at 2 years and 5 years for all patients were
65.5% and 49.8%, respectively, comparable to those
reported from studies of neoadjuvant chemohormonal
therapy. Chi et al19 reported 70% recurrence-free survival
with a follow-up of 43 months, whereas Konety et al16
saw a 55% recurrence-free survival with a median followup of 29 months. As was the case with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, larger studies and long-term follow-up
would be required to determine whether preoperative
chemotherapy is beneficial and whether the addition of
hormonal therapy to chemotherapy in this setting adds
any benefit.
We studied predictors of recurrence because early
recurrences after surgery are associated with increased
mortality.24 In this study, the strongest predictor of treatment failure was the presence of lymphatic disease. These
findings support the pursuit of improved imaging methods with the capacity to identify these high-risk patients
so alternate strategies can be investigated. Not unexpectedly, pretreatment PSA was also predictive of disease
recurrence.
Prostate cancer biomarkers are needed to improve
the prediction of disease recurrence for high-risk patients.
We identified increased tissue VEGF expression as a new
independent predictor of recurrence in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by prostatectomy. This novel finding merits confirmation. This

finding supports the hypothesis that VEGF signaling may
be important in prostate cancer treatment resistance.
Although identified in a different setting and not yet confirmed, the finding is encouraging for the ongoing Cancer
and Leukemia Group B trial of docetaxel with or without
the VEGF antibody, bevacizumab.
An important limitation of this study is our inability
to isolate the effects of tumor biology, surgical skill, and
chemotherapy. Only a randomized clinical trial where the
systemic therapy is the sole variable can measure its impact
on recurrence-free survival. The clinical and biomarker
risk factor analyses should be interpreted as exploratory.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the 2 cytotoxic
drugs that are most commonly used in the treatment of
advanced prostate cancer can be safely combined. The
novel regimen developed here may warrant evaluation in
patients with advanced metastatic disease. We also demonstrated the feasibility of delivering multiagent chemotherapy before prostatectomy. The 5-year recurrence-free
survival results are encouraging despite the absence of
complete pathologic responses. Consideration should be
given to the evaluation of this multimodality strategy in a
randomized controlled trial.
