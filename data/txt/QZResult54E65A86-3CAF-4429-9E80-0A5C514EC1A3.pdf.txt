BACKGROUND. Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent that requires cytochrome
P450 3A (CYP3A) for bioactivation and metabolism. To the authors’ knowledge,
the correlation between dose, pharmacokinetics, CYP3A, and toxicity has not
been fully evaluated. A randomized Phase II trial was performed on 22 soft tissue
sarcoma patients treated with doxorubicin (60 mg/m2/cycle) and either highdose ifosfamide (12 g/m2/cycle) or standard-dose ifosfamide (6 g/m2/cycle). The
pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide and CYP3A measurements observed are reported.

METHODS. Pharmacokinetic parameters for ifosfamide, 2-dichloroethylifosfamide
(2-DCE), and 3-dichloroethylifosfamide (3-DCE) were collected after the first ifosfamide infusion in 13 patients. Bayesian designed limited pharmacokinetic data

were collected from an additional 41 patients. The erythromycin breath test
(ERMBT) was performed on 81 patients as an in vivo phenotypic assessment of
CYP3A activity.

RESULTS. Fourteen-hour (peak) plasma levels of ifosfamide, 2-DCE, and 3-DCE
were found to correlate strongly with the respective area under the curve (AUC)
0–24 values (r ¼ 0.97, 0.94, and 0.95; P < .0001). Patients who experienced a
grade 3–4 absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet, or creatinine toxicity (using
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2]) were found
to have statistically significantly higher median 14-hour plasma levels of ifosfamide, 2-DCE, and 3-DCE compared with patients with grade 0–2 toxicity. ERMBT
was not found to correlate with pharmacokinetic parameters of ifosfamide and
metabolites or toxicity.

CONCLUSIONS. The 14-hour plasma level of ifosfamide, 2-DCE, and 3-DCE is a
simple and appropriate substitute for describing the AUC of ifosfamide after 1
day of a 1-hour to 2-hour infusion of drug. Fourteen-hour plasma levels of ifosfamide and metabolites are useful predictors of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
and creatinine toxicity. ERMBT was not found to accurately correlate with ifosfamide pharmacokinetics or clinical toxicity. Cancer 2007;109:2315–22.  2007

fosfamide is a cancer chemotherapeutic drug that
belongs to the oxazaphosphorine class of alkylating
agents. Significant clinical toxicities involve the central nervous system and the genitourinary system, in
addition to myelosuppression, nausea, emesis, alopecia, and elevated liver enzymes.1–3 Ifosfamide has
complex pharmacokinetics (Fig. 1), which have been
extensively reviewed. The cytochrome P450 3A
(CYP3A) family, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, are the
major enzymes involved in bioactivation of this prodrug.4,5 Cytochrome 2B6 has also been implicated to a
minor degree.6,7 This process involves 4-hydroxylation
and ultimately yields phosphoramide mustard and
acrolein.8,9 Phosphoramide mustard is the therapeutically active metabolite that possesses DNA alkylating
activity.9,10 Acrolein is an inactive agent that is responsible for bladder toxicity.
A second metabolic pathway of ifosfamide
involves detoxification of the drug by side-chain Ndechlorethylation (Fig. 1). CYP3A is the main enzyme
responsible for the formation of therapeutically inactive metabolites 2-dechloroethylifosfamide (2-DCE)
and 3-dechlorethylifosfamide (3-DCE).5,6 The creation
of 2-DCE and 3-DCE yields equal amounts of chloroacetaldehyde, the metabolite responsible for neurotoxicity from ifosfamide.9,11,12 Chloroacetaldehyde is
rapidly degraded,13 and 2-DCE and 3-DCE measurements are often preferred assessments of this pathway.
Given its complex pharmacokinetics and the
potential for severe toxicities, we wished to better
understand the relation between metabolite levels
and ifosfamide toxicity and to explore the use of a
predictive test of hepatic CYP3A activity when using
ifosfamide. The erythromycin breath test (ERMBT) is
performed by intravenous injection of a trace dose of
radiolabeled erythromycin. CYP3A is the major
enzyme catalyzing the subsequent N-demethylation
of erythromycin and conversion to carbon dioxide.14
Exhaled radiolabeled carbon dioxide is then measured
to quantify this reaction.15
This test has been validated as a measure of
CYP3A activity. We have previously shown that the
ERMBT correlates with lower CYP3A activity levels
and clinical toxicity16 in patients receiving docetaxel,
a drug metabolized by the CYP3A system. To our
knowledge, there has been no prior report of using
predictive tests to assay CYP3A activity to assess the
pharmacokinetics and toxicity of ifosfamide.2
Recently, we reported on a Phase II evaluation of
high-dose ifosfamide (12 g/m2/cycle) versus standard
dose ifosfamide (6 g/m2/cycle) in conjunction with
doxorubicin (60 mg/m2/cycle) in patients with soft
tissue sarcoma.17 To better understand and predict

FIGURE 1. Activation and metabolism of ifosfamide.
the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of these treatments,
we performed serum and urine measurements of ifosfamide and metabolites (2-DCE, 3-DCE) and ERMBT
to assess CYP3A activity. Herein, we examine the correlation between dose, drug and metabolite levels,
ERMBT, and toxicities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design
Eligible patients were enrolled in a single-institution
randomized Phase II trial. Eligibility criteria included
patients with documented soft tissue sarcoma, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIIB
disease (grade G3, >5 cm in greatest dimension);
AJCC Stage IIB disease (grade G2, >5 cm in greatest
dimension and deep to initial fascia); or patients
with measurable, metastatic, high-grade (G2
lesions) disease who were previously untreated with
chemotherapy. Patients who had undergone primary
surgical resection received adjuvant chemotherapy,
whereas patients with unresected primary disease
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with
metastases received palliative treatment. Participants
were required to be at least 16 years old with a
Zubrod performance status of 2. Further eligibility
requirements included an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) of 1500 cells/mm3, a platelet count of
100,000 cells/mm3, total bilirubin 1.5 times the
upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine
1.2 times the ULN. Patients were required to have 2
functioning kidneys and an estimated creatinine
clearance of 50 cc/min. The study was approved by
the local Institutional Review Board and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Ifosfamide and Erythromycin Breath Testing/Chugh et al.

Patients were randomized to receive either highdose ifosfamide (3.0 g/m2/day given over 1–2 hours
on Days 1–4) and mesna (1800 mg/m2/day on Days
1–4) or standard dose ifosfamide (1.5 g/m2/day given
over 1–2 hours on Days 1–4) and mesna (1800 mg/
m2/day on Days 1–4). All patients received doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 given as a 72-hour continuous infusion starting Day 1) and filgrastim (5 mcg/kg/dose)
until the ANC was >1500 cells/mm3. Details of the
clinical design and primary clinical results have been
previously published.17

Laboratory Monitoring
Before enrollment, patients had a history and physical examination. Pretherapy laboratory studies
included a complete blood cell count with differential and platelet counts (CDP) and serum chemistries. Chemistries were monitored weekly and before
each cycle. A CDP was obtained on Days 1, 8, 10, 12,
15, 17, and 19 of each cycle.
Blood Sampling for Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
In 13 patients, blood samples were collected at
Hours 0, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0,
12.0, 14.0, 16.0, 24.0, 26.0, and 28.0 during the first
ifosfamide infusion of the first cycle. Additional
patients had blood samples taken at Hours 0, 14, and
26 of ifosfamide infusion. With each sample, a total
of 6 mL of blood was collected, centrifuged, separated into plasma, and frozen at 208C. Ifosfamide,
2-DCE, and 3-DCE were measured via a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS)-stable isotope
method. The accuracy and precision of ifosfamide
quantitation is 107.5% and 4.7%, respectively, at 1.5
lmol/L; 95.4% and 1.37%, respectively, at 20.0 lmol/
L; and 95.4% and 1.37%, respectively, at 100 lmol/L.
Urine was collected for 24 hours after the start of
the first ifosfamide infusion in a random subset of
patients treated on trial. Plasma and urine samples
were spiked with an internal standard solution containing the oxazaphosphorine derivative trofosfamide
and were subsequently extracted twice with dichloromethane. Simultaneous determination of ifosfamide,
its dechloroethyl metabolites, and trofosfamide was
performed by means of nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P)
flame ionization gas chromatography/nitrogen phosphorus flame ionization (GC/NPFID) using a fusedsilica capillary column (HP5 [5% PhMe Silicone]) under
isothermal conditions, with N2 serving as the carrier
gas. The temperature of the oven, injector, and detector
were set at 1958C, 3008C, and 3008C, respectively.18
Erythromycin Breath Test
Four lCi of [14C N-methyl] erythromycin dissolved in
2 mL of normal saline was injected intravenously

2317

into patients before the initiation of any therapy.14 A
single sample of exhaled carbon dioxide was taken
20 minutes later into vials that contained 4 mL of
benzethonium hydroxide and ethanol (1:1) and a
trace amount of thymopthalein. A total of 12 mL of
Aquasol was added to each sample, which was then
sealed in darkness for 24 hours. A scintillation counter measured the amount of radioactivity present.
The percentage of administered carbon exhaled per
minute was calculated assuming an endogenous carbon dioxide production of 5 mmol CO2/m2/min.

Toxicity Measurements
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity
Criteria (version 2.0) were used to classify adverse
events.
Statistical Analysis
The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for
the time period 0 to 24 hours using the standard
trapezoidal method. For ifosfamide only, Kel, the
elimination rate constant, was calculated using a
mixed effects model for the log10 of ifosfamide concentration. Each patient was allowed to have a random intercept (3-hour plasma measurement). The
Kel values were used to complete the exponential
decay of ifosfamide to calculate the AUC(0 to infinity). Metabolite AUC and 14-hour levels, and ERMBT
and 14-hour drug levels were compared using Spearman correlation coefficient. The occurrence of toxicity was dichotomized by grade into serious (grades 3
and 4) and none to mild/moderate (grades 0 to 2)
using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. Comparisons between continuous pharmacokinetic parameters and dichotomous toxicity outcomes were
conducted using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistic, which tests whether the median values between
toxicity groups were similar.
The pattern of changes in hematological parameters (white blood cell count [WBC], platelets, hemoglobin) over the first 4 cycles was analyzed using a
random effects model including fixed effects for
dose, cycle, day within each cycle, and interactions.
Measurements of serum creatinine were converted
into creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault
formula.

24 h). The coefficients of elimination of ifosfamide
used to calculate the AUC(0 to infinity) were 0.04398
and 0.03889 for the high- and low-dose groups,
respectively.
The AUC (n ¼ 13) values for each metabolite
were found to be strongly correlated with their 14hour (peak) levels (Table 1). Given this robust relation and the difficulty in obtaining extensive sampling of these metabolites in all patients, we
collected 14-hour drug levels in 41 additional
patients and performed further correlations based on
these values. This provides the basis for future evaluations of ERMBT and toxicity using our larger sample size of 14-hour metabolite levels (n ¼ 54).

ERMBT Results Do Not Correlate With Ifosfamide
14-Hour Levels
ERMBT was performed on 81 patients. Thirteen
patients had ifosfamide and metabolite AUC data for
comparison and 52 patients had 14-hour levels available for comparison. There was no relation observed
between ifosfamide, 2-DCE, 3-DCE AUC or 14-hour
levels and ERMBT (Table 2).

Urinary Ifosfamide and Metabolites Concentration
Correlates With 14-Hour Plasma Levels
Twenty-five patients treated on the high-dose ifosfamide arm had 24-hour urinary metabolite evaluations. The median total amount (in micromoles)
excreted for ifosfamide, 2-DCE, and 3-DCE were 2377
(range, 1075–4416), 814 (range, 288–1450), and 893
(range, 455–1703), respectively. Twenty-nine patients
treated with standard dose ifosfamide had median
total amounts (in micromoles) of ifosfamide, 2-DCE,
and 3-DCE excreted in the urine of 3680 (range, 705–
8622), 1101 (range, 301–3253), and 1500 (range, 363–
2974). The 14-hour plasma measurements were positively and significantly correlated with the 24-hour
urinary concentration (Table 3).

Characterization of Hematologic Toxicity in Patients
Treated on High- vs Low-Dose Ifosfamide Arms
WBCs, ANCs, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were
determined at 7 different time points during each
cycle of therapy. This information is plotted in Figure
2 and reveals the differential degree of hematologic
toxicity in patients treated on high-dose or low-dose
ifosfamide arms in conjunction with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF). Leukopenia, anemia,
and thrombocytopenia were found to be more severe
in the high-dose ifosfamide arm and worsened with
subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.
Patients on the low-dose ifosfamide arm exhibited 2 WBC peaks each cycle. This potentially indicates an early rise in WBC due to GCSF therapy
followed by suppression due to chemotherapy and a
second peak due to continued GCSF effect. The decrement in peak observed in the high-dose arm during the fourth cycle of chemotherapy may reflect
depletion of stem cells.
Reduction in hemoglobin was cumulative and
worsened with each subsequent cycle in both doses.
Platelet counts dropped more dramatically in the
high-dose arm and worsened with each cycle.

Correlation of Hematologic Toxicity With 14-Hour Levels
of Ifosfamide and Metabolites, ERMBT, and 24-Hour
Urinary Concentrations
Fourteen-hour levels of ifosfamide, 2-DCE, and 3DCE were compared with hematologic toxicity
experienced during the first cycle of treatment. There
was a statistically significant difference in the 14hour levels of each metabolite and both neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia (Table 4). Each 10-lL/L incremental increase in the 14-hour ifosfamide level
increased the likelihood of grade 3/4 neutropenia by
more than 2-fold (odds ratio of 2.1; 95% confidence
interval, 1.4–3.1). No correlation was observed with

hemoglobin toxicity, except with 3-DCE, but only 4
patients were found to experience grade 3/4 toxicity
after 1 cycle of therapy.
ERMBT results were also compared with hematologic toxicity and controlled for patients treated on
the high-dose and standard-dose ifosfamide arm. No
correlation was noted with ERMBT results and ANC
and hemoglobin toxicity. Patients with an ERMBT
2.0 were more likely to experience severe thrombocytopenia.
Urinary concentrations of metabolites were
found to exhibit a statistically significant correlation
with ANC toxicity (Table 5), but there was no significant association noted with either hemoglobin or
platelet toxicity.

Correlation of Nonhematologic Toxicity With 14-Hour
Levels of Ifosfamide and Metabolites and ERMBT
In all, 52 patients with relevant pharmacokinetic data
and creatinine toxicity data were evaluated. Two
patients experienced grade 1 toxicity, 2 patients
experienced grade 2 toxicity, and 1 patient experienced grade 4 toxicity. Despite the small numbers of
patients experiencing renal toxicity, there was a significant difference in 14-hour plasma levels in
patients with grade 0/1 toxicity compared with grade
2/3/4 toxicity (Table 6). Median levels of ifosfamide,
2-DCE, and 3-DCE in patients experiencing grade 2/
3/4 creatinine toxicity were more than twice that of
other patients. No correlation was identified with 24hour urinary concentrations or ERMBT results after
stratifying for both high-dose and low-dose ifosfamide arms (data not shown).
Seven patients with available pharmacokinetic
data were found to have any form of neurologic toxicity. No statistically significant difference was noted
in the 14-hour plasma levels and ERMBT results
when comparing patients with and without neurologic toxicity. However, the trend was similar to that
observed with renal toxicity. Patients with grade 0
neurologic toxicity were found to have a statistically
significant difference in 24-hour urinary concentra-

tion values compared with patients with grade 1–3
toxicities (498.6 vs 805.6; P ¼ .019). No other correlations were observed with the urinary concentrations.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we described ifosfamide pharmacokinetics in a trial of soft-tissue sarcoma patients
treated with 6 g/m2 or 12 g/m2 of ifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin (60 mg/m2). We demonstrated that the 14-hour level of ifosfamide taken on
Day 1 of a 3-day treatment is a useful substitute in
describing the pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide, and
correlates well with hematologic toxicity in the first
cycle of therapy. Clinically, this observation may be
useful in treating patients at high risk for complications with myelosuppression (ie, underlying lowgrade infections, poor performance status). With further validation, it could potentially allow for decreasing the dose of ifosfamide on subsequent treatment
days to decrease the risks associated with hematologic toxicity. Of course, such an intervention would
also decrease the tumor’s dose of ifosfamide, which
may or may not impact patient outcomes.17
As hematologic toxicities progressively worsen in
subsequent cycles (Fig. 2), the value of this observation made only during the first cycle of treatment
could be questioned. In addition, ifosfamide has
been reported to be subject to autoinduction and
thus drug metabolism may increase over time.3,19,20
Evaluation of similar pharmacokinetic parameters in
subsequent cycles may provide useful information.
Renal and neurologic toxicities were reported to
occur relatively infrequently in this limited population, making it difficult to reach conclusions regarding the predictive value of pharmacokinetic
parameters. A significant difference was observed for
all metabolites and renal toxicity. A significant difference was noted only in 14-hour plasma levels of ifosfamide in patients with and without any neurologic
toxicity. Because chloroacetaldehyde is believed to be
the metabolite responsible for neurologic toxicity, we

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test the equality of the median between toxicity groups.

expected to see an increase in both 2-DCE and 3DCE metabolites. Given the low incidence of these
toxicities in this trial, it is not surprising that only a
trend and not a more definitive association was
observed.
Although drug and metabolite urine concentrations and total amount excreted were found to be
significantly correlated with pharmacokinetic parameters, the correlation was not robust. Collecting 24hour urine samples even in a controlled setting is
problematic, and the practical value of urine sampling clinically for drug toxicity prediction is likely
limited.
ERMBT was not found to be of value in predicting ifosfamide pharmacokinetics or toxicity in this
study of combination ifosfamide and doxorubicin
therapy. Although the correlation between lower
ERMBT value and more severe thrombocytopenia
was considered significant, there were relatively few
numbers of affected patients.
ERMBT has been shown to be a reproducible
assessor of hepatic CYP3A4 activity in previous studies and has shown to predict the clearance of
CYP3A4 substrates, including docetaxel and cyclosporine.15,21 Although CYP3A4 is identified as the
main enzyme involved in ifosfamide activation and
metabolism, CYP3A5 and CYP2B6 have also been
shown to be involved to some extent, and are not
measured by the ERMBT (Fig. 1).5–7,15,22
In addition, although ERMBT has been shown to
correlate with CYP3A activity, the correlation
between ifosfamide and CYP3A levels is complex.
CYP3A is mainly responsible for the transformation
of ifosfamide to active product and the metabolism
to inactive product. Additional work to separate out
these 2 processes may be necessary to arrive at a

2321

predictive pharmacokinetic test. The concomitant
use of dexamethasone and other CYP3A4 inducers
and inhibitors by study patients may or may not
serve as additional confounding factors.16,22,23 The
CYP3A family may also play a role in doxorubicin
metabolism, which was coadministered with ifosfamide in this trial.24
The ERMBT has been the subject of much pharmacologic criticism. Full discussion has been
reviewed elsewhere.25 To summarize, ERMBT has to
date been shown to be a reasonable predictor of
CYP3A activity of some, but not all, substrates. Many
additional probes exist for evaluating CYP3A activity
including midazolam, dextromethorphan, verapamil,
and cortisol.26 The midazolam clearance test is currently the subject of investigation and offers the theoretical advantage of assessing both hepatic and
intestinal CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.27 It is interesting to
note that in some studies the ERMBT has been
found to have a significantly positive correlation with
midazolam clearance, whereas in others no correlation was observed.27,28 The midazolam clearance test
has been shown to be more predictive than the
ERMBT in a study examining the pharmacokinetics
of the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan, another
antineoplastic agent with complex metabolism involving both CYP3A4 and uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferase 1A1.29 Therefore, because the
ERMBT did not appear to be useful in this setting,
testing using other probes in future studies may
prove to be more fruitful.
There may be additional factors that may be useful in predicting ifosfamide toxicity that were not
evaluated in the current study. Ifosfamide is administered as a racemic mixture, and some studies suggest
that (R)ifosfamide may have a more favorable efficacy and toxicity profile.30 There also may be enantioselective differences in ifosfamide metabolism.
Specifically, in vitro studies have shown that CYP2B6
may be the key enzyme in creating (S)-2-DCE and
(S)-3-DCE.7 We did not investigate the difference in
stereoisomers of ifosfamide in this clinical investigation or any in vivo probes of CYP2B6 activity.
Although the metabolism of ifosfamide has been
studied extensively, it remains poorly understood. In
the current study, we demonstrated that pharmacokinetic data correlate with some forms of ifosfamide
toxicity and therefore have the potential to affect
clinical practice. Further validation of the use of
pharmacokinetic parameters in a prospective setting
may prove valuable. Although ERMBT was not found
to be a useful in vivo probe for our patients treated
with ifosfamide and doxorubicin, further investigation of in vivo CYP3A4 activity using the midazolam
