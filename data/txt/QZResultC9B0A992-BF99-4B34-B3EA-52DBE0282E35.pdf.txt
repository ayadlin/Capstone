ABSTRACT:
This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of molecular pathways and
their clinical relevance in melanoma. Metastatic melanoma was a grim diagnosis, but
in recent years tremendous advances have been made in treatments. Chemotherapy
provided little benefit in these patients, but development of targeted and new immune
approaches made radical changes in prognosis. This would not have happened without
remarkable advances in understanding the biology of disease and tremendous
progress in the genomic (and other “omics”) scale analyses of tumors. The big
problems facing the field are no longer focused exclusively on the development of
new treatment modalities, though this is a very busy area of clinical research. The
focus shifted now to understanding and overcoming resistance to targeted therapies,
and understanding the underlying causes of the heterogeneous responses to immune
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

The revolutionary discovery of a striking, if
temporary, effect that targeted inhibition of BRAF has on
the clinical course of metastatic melanoma has spiked a
new wave of research into molecular targets. In addition,
it has raised a number of new questions: what are the
mechanisms of both inherent and acquired resistance to
BRAF inhibitors and the possible ways to overcome this
resistance; how is the activating effect of BRAF inhibition

melanomas. Indeed, the rate of transversions characteristic
of UV-induced lesions is much higher in melanoma than
the rates of other nucleotide substitutions. The high rate
of mutations in melanoma makes it particularly difficult
to distinguish between causative (“driver”) mutations and
bystander (“passenger”) mutations.
In one recent study [1], a wide range of pointmutation rates was observed: they were lowest in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

melanomas in which primaries arose on non-UV-exposed
hairless skin of the extremities (3 and 14 mutations/
megabase [Mb] of genome); intermediate in those
originating from hair-bearing skin of the trunk (5-55
mutations/Mb); and highest in a patient with a documented
history of chronic sun exposure (111 mutations/Mb).
Uveal melanomas, tumors with generally poor prognosis,
nevertheless have a fairly low mutation rate [2].

BRAF

Interestingly, melanomas that are wild type for both BRAF
and NRAS have almost five times higher mutational loads
than tumors where one of these oncogenes is mutated [3].
The different types of melanoma appear to have
distinct sets of relevant somatogenic alterations (Tables
1 and 2). Some of the difference could be attributed to
the lack of UV involvement in pathogenesis of acral and
mucosal melanomas. Uveal melanoma was recognized
as distinct tumor for a long time, and it is reflected in
predominance of driver mutations in G protein subunits
rather then BRAF or NRAS mutations. Mutational
analyses of mucosal melanoma concluded that this subtype
shares with cutaneous melanoma relatively few mutations
in specific genes, suggesting different mechanisms of
carcinogenesis [4]. The rare conjuctival melanoma
apparently has a mutational landscape similar to cutaneous
melanoma [5], pending confirmation from an analysis of a
larger number of tumors.
This paper describes genetic alterations that are
known to occur in melanoma and information about their
role in melanomagenesis, as well as their suitability as
targets for therapeutic intervention. The latest information
on molecular events underlying inherent or acquired
resistance to targeted therapies is also included, along
with immunotherapeutic approaches and prognostic
methodologies.
Multiple cellular pathways have been implicated
in melanomagenesis, ranging from signal transduction to
developmental and transcriptional pathways and cell cycle
deregulation (Table 1). The search for driver mutations
in melanoma continues, with the previously identified
subtypes involving BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and
GNA11 expanded recently to include NF1 and telomerase
(Table 2). Together, these driver mutations are very
likely to define the vast majority of molecular subtypes
in melanoma and, eventually, the identified mutations in
drivers will guide targeted therapy choices. However, for a
number of reasons, such as oncogene-induced senescence
(discussed below), driver mutations result in a frank
tumorigenic phenotype only in the presence of “supporting
mutations” that are also listed in Table 2 and described
below. It is likely that these supporting mutations have to
be targeted along with driver mutations to achieve durable
responses. Finally, immunotherapies continue to play an
important role in melanoma treatment strategies and are
also described here.

BRAF mutations (V600E in 70%-80% of all BRAF
mutations in all cancers) occur early in melanomagenesis
and are found in a high percentage of melanocytic nevi.
Other mutations at the V600 position leading to alternate
amino acid substitutions (V600K, V600D, V600R)
account for another 5% to 15% of all BRAF mutations.
Mutations in BRAF alone do not induce melanoma, and
the high frequency of BRAF mutations in benign nevi
supports this conclusion [6]. Moreover, expression of
the BRAF mutations in preclinical models is associated
with the phenomenon known as oncogene-induced
senescence (OIS) [7], which results in a cell-cycle arrest in
BRAFV600E-expressing cells. Additional genetic events
in BRAF-mutant cells, such as deletion of CDKN2A or
PTEN, are necessary to elicit a fully cancerous phenotype
(reviewed by Flaherty, 2012 [8]).
Overall, about 50% of melanomas of all clinical
types have mutations in BRAF. BRAF mutations are more
frequent in melanomas that develop in intermittently
sun-exposed skin and less so in acral and mucosal
melanomas. BRAF mutations are not found in uveal
melanomas. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS (~20% of
melanomas of the same origin/location as BRAF-mutated
melanomas) are almost always mutually exclusive. The
V600E mutation in BRAF confers to this kinase the
ability to activate MEK (the only known downstream
target of BRAF) independent of RAS. A small subset of
melanomas that have no mutations in the major driver
oncogenes (Table 2) were found to harbor BRAF fusions
involving other genes. These might comprise 4 to 8% of
the “pan-negative” melanomas, and, while their growth
is not affected by BRAF inhibitors, they are sensitive to
MEK inhibitors.
The reported results of trials with selective oral
BRAF inhibitors showed efficacy in melanoma patients
with BRAFV600E mutations [9]. In addition, inhibition
of MEK (the only known phosphorylation substrate of
BRAF) is considered to be a valid therapeutic intervention
for both BRAF- and NRAS-mutated melanoma. However,
the success of BRAF inhibitors has not come without
problems:
•	 A significant minority of patients with mutant
BRAF show no response to BRAF inhibition
[10]. Preclinical results suggest that this group
has a variety of additional genomic somatic
alterations that confer the resistance phenotype
(discussed below).
•	 Most patients initially responding to BRAF
inhibitors develop resistance to those inhibitors
within a relatively short period of time (<1
year).
•	 About 20% of BRAF inhibitor-treated patients
developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas
[10]. These results from a paradoxical activation

of MEK-ERK in BRAF wild type cells [11]
Photodynamic therapy (PTD) was reported
to be effective in treatment of these usually
numerous tumors [12]. Recent data suggest
that activation of AMPK might attenuate the
effects of BRAF inhibition on proliferation of
BRAF-wild keratinocytes through inhibitory
phosphorylation of BRAF [13]. Accelerated
development of RAS-mutant leukemia in a
patient treated with vemurafenib was also
described [14], further raising concern about
the development of other malignancies as a
consequence of BRAF inhibition [15].
Paradoxical effects of BRAFV600 inhibitors
in activating wild-type BRAF and/or CRAF.
The mechanism of this is thought to be due to
conformational changes in wild-type BRAF
protein induced by binding of the inhibitors
promoting the formation of heterodimers with
other RAF isoforms, leading to MEK activation
[11]. This effect might trigger growth of new
malignant melanoma tumors that have wildtype BRAF, but high expression of RAS-GTP,
Akt, and cyclin D1 [16, 17]. A recent study
provided a possible mechanism of activation of
wild-type BRAF by inhibitors through a relief
of inhibitory autophosphorylation [18].

inhibitor trametinib showed some clinical responses
in BRAF-mutant patients that had undergone previous
immune- or chemotherapy, but had no effect in patients
who were previously treated with vemurafenib [25].
This strongly indicates that mechanisms involved in
development of resistance to mutant BRAF confer
resistance to MEK inhibition as well. FDA approved
trametinib/Mekinist for melanoma in May 2013.
Most importantly, it is increasingly clear that
combination treatments, such as BRAF and MEK
inhibition investigated in a recently reported clinical
study [26], have potential for a robust and lasting clinical
response in the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma.
Combination dabrafenib+trametinib trial responses were
not only more numerous compared to dabrafenib alone,
but also more durable. This combination is now being
considered for approval by the FDA. BRAF inhibitors
are explored in a number of clinical trials in combination
with inhibitors of MEK, including four phase III trials
(NCT01689519,
NCT01597908,
NCT01682083,
NCT01682083), the first of which involves a new MEK
inhibitor GDC-0973 or cobimetinib. Other early-phase
combination trials with approved BRAF inhibitors explore
addition of inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, CDK, HSP90, RTKs
and other targets, as well as immunotherapy.
Targeting ERK1/2, the kinases at the lower end of
the MAPK cascade, is an emerging therapeutic strategy,
with several candidate drugs in preclinical development.
ERK inhibitors have an important advantage of being
potentially active in the setting of acquired resistance to
inhibitors of BRAF or MEK [27].

Treatment approaches to BRAF mutations
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the mutant BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib/
Zelboraf in 2011. Another inhibitor, dabrafenib/Tafinlar,
was approved in May 2013. Dabrafenib showed clinical
responses in 59% of patients with V600E/K mutation,
including 7% complete responders [19]. A newer inhibitor,
LGX818, is in early stages of testing. New inhibitors are in
development to eliminate the side effects associated with
the paradoxical activation by vemurafenib of the ERK1/2
pathway in wild-type BRAF cells. PLX7904, a new
“paradox-breaking” BRAF inhibitor, appears to inhibit
ERK1/2 in BRAF-mutant cells without activating BRAF
in BRAF wild-type cells [20]. Dosing schedules with
BRAF inhibitors were explored in a genetically engineered
mouse model (GEMM), where intermittent inhibition
of BRAF by vemurafenib works better than continuous
treatment [21]. Intermittent dosing of vemurafenib has not
yet been tested in clinical trials.
Inhibition of MEK has been explored in clinical
trials for melanoma patients with mutant BRAF [22,
23]. A phase III randomized trial comparing MEK
inhibitor trametinib to chemotherapy showed a marked
improvement in both progression free and overall survival
(PFS and OS) in the trametinib arm [23]. Combination of
selumetinib/AZD6244 with alkylating agent dacarbazine
improved PFS in a randomized clinical trial [24]. MEK

BRAF mutations other than V600
A number of BRAF mutants other than V600 were
identified in human cancers [28]. Some of these have a
relatively low kinase activity compared to BRAFV600E
[29]. Three mutants with low activity—G469E, G466A,
and N581S—were shown to still activate ERK via a
mechanism involving their ability to strongly activate
CRAF[29]. The low-activity BRAF mutations G469E/
D594G that signal through CRAF were later identified in
a panel of melanoma cell lines [30]. Analysis of BRAF
exon 15 in 49 tumors negative for BRAFV600 mutations,
as well as other known driver mutations in KIT, NRAS,
GNAQ, and GNA11, showed that two (4%) harbored
L597 mutations and another two involved BRAF D594
and K601 mutations [30].
Melanomas with BRAF mutations other than V600
have not been specifically targeted in clinical trials. Kinase
inhibitor sorafenib is a better inhibitor of CRAF than
mutant BRAF; sorafenib induced apoptosis in vitro and in
a xenograft model in vivo in tumors with G469E/D594G
[30]. A patient with BRAF(L597S)-mutant metastatic
melanoma responded significantly to treatment with the
MEK inhibitor TAK-733 [31]. Another patient with this

inhibitor LEE011 for NRAS-mutant melanoma
is ongoing.
•	 Sensitivity of NRAS-mutant cell lines to MEK
inhibitors was shown to be associated with
expression of AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor)
in vitro [38].
•	 A study of combinatorial drug interactions in
vitro pinpointed the combination of simvastatin
with a CDK inhibitor as the only fairly effective
cytotoxic treatment for NRAS-mutated
melanoma cell lines [39].
The combinations of inhibitors to target NRASactivated signaling through MEK and PI3K, MEK and
AKT, MEK and PI3K/mTOR, as well as MEK and VEGFreceptor inhibition, are now in early phase clinical trials.
Only a few trials specifically target melanomas with
NRAS mutations, but a number of trials use combinations
of agents or single agents that could have therapeutic
benefits in this subgroup of melanoma. Single agents in
phase I or early phase II trials include inhibitors of CDK
(PD0332991, dinaciclib , LY2835219, BAY1000394,
LEE011), the Notch pathway (RO4929097), and
Aurora kinase A (MLN8237/alisertib, GSK1070916A)
(Supplemental Table 2).

NRAS
Approximately 20% of melanomas have mutations
in the GTPase NRAS. NRAS and BRAF mutations are
almost always mutually exclusive. Therapeutic approaches
targeting mutant NRAS directly have not been successful.
Combination treatments targeting the downstream
effectors of NRAS remain a viable option.

NRAS

The pathways downstream of NRAS that could
be targeted simultaneously in NRAS-mutant melanoma
include, but are not limited to, MEK, PI3K/mTOR, and
cell-cycle-related targets. PTEN abnormalities are rarely
found in NRAS-mutant tumors [32]. Monotherapy with
the MEK inhibitor MEK162 showed limited partial
responses (20%) in NRAS-mutant patients and represents
the most active single-agent targeted therapy evaluated to
date [33]. A recent study identified the basis of different
activity of MEK inhibitors in BRAF versus KRAS mutant
cancers. Unlike trametinib-like inhibitors that inhibit
phosphorylated MEK and are effective in the setting of
BRAFV600 mutants, the new class of inhibitors, like
GDC-0623, inhibit feedback activation of MEK by
RAF, and are therefore more efficacious in the setting of
mutant KRAS [34]. It is likely that GDC-0623, which is
currently in a phase I clinical trial, might be efficacious in
melanomas with mutant NRAS.
Preclinical studies indicate several potential points
of intervention
•	 NRAS-driven melanoma in genetically
engineered mice responded only to the
combination of MEK and PI3K/mTOR dual
inhibitors out of 16 treatment combinations
tested [35]. Combined targeting of MEK
and PI3K was superior to MEK and mTOR
inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines
and xenografts [36]. A number of clinical trials
examining this combination are ongoing.
•	 In an inducible model of NRAS-mutant
melanoma, genetic ablation of NRAS
triggered cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, while
pharmacological inhibition of MEK activated
apoptosis, but not cell-cycle arrest. CDK4 was
implicated as a key driver of these differences
and combined pharmacological inhibition
of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial
synergy in therapeutic efficacy in a mouse
model [37]. The phase I/II trial NCT01781572
with MEK inhibitor MEK162 and CDK
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GNAQ and GNA11
Activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11,
encoding members of the Gα(q) family of G protein α
subunits, are driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma [40, 41].
Mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 are mutually exclusive
and are present in the vast majority of uveal melanomas
[42]. GNA11 has a stronger association with metastatic
uveal melanoma than GNAQ. Mutations in these GTPbinding proteins activate the MAPK pathway.

Potential treatment approaches to GNAQ and
GNA11 mutations
A randomized phase II clinical trial compared
the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) with
temozolomide (NCT01143402) with results showing
superiority of selumetinib in terms of PFS and overall
response rate (ORR), but not OS (J Clin Oncol 31, 2013
suppl; abstr CRA9003). GNAQ mutation promotes
resistance in vitro to selumetinib, but the combination of
selumetinib with the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor
AZD8055 might be more promising [43]. A trial of
the MTOR inhibitor everolimus and the somatostatinreceptor-activating peptide pasireotide/SOM232 is
recruiting patients (NCT01252251).
Inhibition of both PI3K and MAPK, but neither of
them singly, might also work in uveal melanoma as seen
from in vitro experiments [44]. No trials involving this
combination are ongoing.

Enzastaurin and AEB071, PKC inhibitors, have
shown some activity against uveal melanoma cell lines
in vitro [45, 46]. PKC is involved in signal transduction
from GNAQ to MEK. AEB071 is tested in a phase I
clinical study NCT01430416 as a single agent, and
will be examined in combination with trametinib in
NCT01801358.
Recently, it was shown that the guanine nucleotide
exchange factor Trio is involved in mitogenic signaling
through GNAQ and GNA11. Trio is essential for activating
Rho- and Rac-regulated signaling pathways acting on JNK
and p38, thereby transducing proliferative signals from
Gα(q) to the nucleus independently of phospholipase C-β
[47]. These findings might open new avenues for treatment
of uveal melanoma.

metastatic disease and poor prognosis [56]. ATF2 control
of melanoma development is mediated, in part, through
its negative regulation of SOX10 and consequently,
of MITF transcription. In human patients, virtually all
congenital nevi and melanomas are SOX10 positive.
SOX10 silencing in human melanoma cells suppresses
neural crest stem cell properties, counteracts proliferation
and cell survival, and completely abolishes in vivo tumor
formation [57].
SOX10, PAX3, and MITF participate in regulation
of MET (HGF receptor), which is expressed at high levels
in human melanoma [58]. MITF and PAX3 bind directly
to the MET promoter; coexpression of these three proteins
is found in melanoma biopsies [59].
PPAR-γ coactivators PGC-1α and PGC-1β are
critical components of the melanogenic system governed
by MITF. Melanomas with high expression of PGC-1α
exhibit increased expression of mitochondrial respiration
complexes and increased oxidative phosphorylation [60].
The high MITF-high PGC-1α expressing cells have an
increased capacity to withstand oxidative stress, and,
unlike PGC-1α low cells, respond poorly to ROS-inducing
agents such as PEITC or piperlongumine [60]. In addition,
polymorphism studies reveal expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTLs) in the PGC-1β gene that correlate with
protection from melanoma in humans [61].
BCL2A1, a lineage-specific anti-apoptotic protein in
the BCL2 family, is amplified and overexpressed in MITFhigh melanomas, and confers resistance to BRAF inhibitor
[62]. Suppression of BCL2A1 might have clinical benefit
in this group of melanomas [62].
A recent paper proposed targeting of tyrosinase
(MITF transcriptional target) by first inducing expression
of MITF in melanoma cells using the well-known antifolate drug methotrexate. The second step is to target
the now high-MITF expressing cells with a designed
pro-drug that is converted to a cytotoxic anti-folate drug
by the MITF-induced tyrosinase [63]. The death of thus
targeted cells should then ensue as a consequence of
dTTP depletion. There are many questions regarding the
rationale and execution of this strategy, including how
methotrexate induces MITF expression, how to reconcile
the known oncogenic role of MITF in melanoma to further
increase its expression, and how targeting DHFR­—a long
explored target in cancer—could overcome the acquired
resistance long associated with methotrexate. The loss
of tyrosinase expression in advanced amelanotic tumors
would need to be considered as well.
The crystal structure of MITF was resolved recently,
paving the way for the future targeting of MITF in
melanoma and other cancers [64].

MITF
Microphthalmia-associated
transcription
factor  MITF is a lineage survival oncogene, amplified
in 20% of melanoma cases [48]; amplification of MITF
is associated with a reduced 5-year survival. MITF is
mutated in some familial melanomas [49]. The variant
MITF(E318K) co-segregates with affected individuals
in familial melanoma and is likely to be a gain-offunction (GOF) mutation. It abolishes a SUMO-ilation
site on MITF that reportedly acts to inhibit transcriptional
activity of MITF. Transcriptional targets of MITF have
been identified and, besides a large number of lineagespecific transcripts, include genes related to regulation
of cell cycle, among them CDK2 [50]. Considering that
MITF itself is currently not a druggable target, inhibition
of CDK2 is a plausible aim in melanoma with MITF
aberrations.
Other candidate targets in the MITF program
include receptor tyrosine kinase TYRO3, which regulates
expression of MITF in a SOX-10-dependent manner [51].
Ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) was shown to be
responsible for MITF deubiquitination and stabilization.
USP13 is essential for melanoma growth in vitro and
in vivo and might be another target in MITF-mutated
melanoma [52].
Hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1α was also reported to
be a transcriptional target of MITF[53], and its expression
is apparently stimulated by MITF with the well-known
consequences of stimulating tumor survival, angiogenesis,
and metastases. Paradoxically, expression of MITF itself is
reduced under hypoxic conditions in normal melanocytes
and melanoma via direct binding of transcription repressor
DEC1, which is activated by HIF1α [54]. This suggests a
negative feedback loop. A recent study implicated HIF1
factors in promoting melanoma invasion and metastases
without affecting proliferation of the primary tumors [55].
MITF is regulated by the transcription factor ATF2.
Primary melanoma specimens that exhibit a high nuclear
ATF2:MITF ratio were found to be associated with

patients with specific KIT genetic aberrations, such as
mutation K642E [73] and a small duplication [74]. Two
patients whose melanomas harbored L576P responded to
dasatinib [75]. Even when alterations in KIT are present
in tumors, not all are predictive of responses to kinase
inhibitors. Overexpression of KIT in melanoma was
found not to confer sensitivity to imatinib [76]. Sunitinib
malate was tested in another trial; again, no correlation
was observed between the degree of KIT expression and
longer PFS or OS [77].
Recently, trials of imatinib and nilotinib have
shown promising results in trials where patients were
selected for KIT mutations. Phase II trials of imatinib in
melanoma produced only modest responses to treatment,
but 9 of the 10 partial responses (PRs) were observed in
patients with mutations in exons 11 or 13 [78]. Another
phase II trial of imatinib in 28 patients with alterations
in KIT produced durable responses in 16% of patients,
predominantly in those with KIT mutations versus those
with amplifications [79]. Sunitinib induced responses in 3
out of 4 patients with KIT mutations in exons 11 and 13,
but only in one out of six patients with KIT amplification
[80]. Preliminary results of a trial with nilotinib were
published when it showed durable responses in patients
with KIT mutations [81]. A recent phase II trial of imatinib
in selected patient population with mucosal, acral, or
chronically sun-damaged melanoma concluded with an
overall disease-control rate of 50%, but the responses
were observed in 77% of patients with mutated KIT and
only in 18% of those with amplified KIT. The best ORR
was, respectively, 54% versus 0% [82]. Preexisting NRAS
mutations conferred intrinsic resistance to imatinib [82]
and to sunitinib (Minor et al., 2012) in patients with KIT
mutation. It is becoming clear that inhibitors of KIT should
be used in selected patient populations whose tumors have
KIT mutations in exon 11 and 13 but not where KIT is not
mutated but amplified [83].
At least 10 ongoing trials test the activity of the
aforementioned inhibitors in KIT-mutated melanoma
as single agents. Planned and ongoing trials include
combinations of KIT inhibitors with other targeted drugs
and immunotherapy. Trial NCT01738139 recruits patients
for the combination of imatinib with ipilimumab (an
immunomodulatory antibody to CTLA4) in patients with
various tumors that have somatic alterations of KIT.

These findings on MITF-mediated pathways remain
in the domain of preclinical research, although targeting
MET receptor is feasible because MET inhibitors
(cabozantinib et al.) are in clinical trials for cancers
other than melanoma. For now, panobinostat/ LBH589
(HDAC inhibitor) is in early clinical testing in melanoma
(NCT01065467), and also involves examining the effect
of panobinostat on MITF expression. The rationale
behind investigating HAD inhibitors is supported by a
study demonstrating efficacy of the HDAC inhibitor in
suppressing MITF expression in vitro and in vivo [65].
A new study opened a possibility of targeting
the nuclear translocation of ATF2 by inhibiting PKCε,
which phosphorylates ATF2 and induces its transport
to the nucleus. The two compounds found to promote
cytoplasmic localization of ATF2 were identified in an
image-based screen [66].

KIT
KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by
binding of the cytokine stem cell factor (SCF); mutations
and amplification of KIT are found in particular subsets
of melanoma. KIT mutations activate signal-transduction
pathways (MAPK and PI3K) that ultimately lead to cell
proliferation. Mutations in KIT are found in mucosal,
acral, and chronically sun-exposed skin melanomas [67].
KIT mutations are rare in melanoma, but the availability
of selective inhibitors for KIT has prompted interest in
targeting this oncogene. These inhibitors—imatinib,
sunitinib, nilotinib, and dasatanib—were developed
for different cancers (chronic myeloid leukemia,
gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and different kinases, but
they showed activity against KIT. Approximately 70% of
KIT mutations identified in melanoma are found in exon
11, most commonly L576P, and in the kinase domain
in exon 13, most often K642E [68]. The majority of
mutations of KIT found in melanoma also occur in other
cancers that are responsive to KIT inhibitors.

Treatment approaches to KIT mutations

NF1/neurofibromin

Targeting KIT with imatinib has demonstrated
remarkable efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST), but initial trials in melanoma were
unsuccessful, clearly due to the absence of selection of
patients with aberrations in KIT [69-71]. Dasatinib was
tested as a single agent in unselected melanoma patients
and also showed poor response and high toxicity [72].
Nevertheless, case reports continued to surface that
demonstrated the efficacy of imatinib in melanoma
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NF1 is a tumor suppressor regulating signaling from
RAS; germline mutations in NF1 deregulate both PI3K and
MAPK pathways and result in familial neurofibromatosis.
Some neurofibromatosis patients with inactivation of NF1
develop melanomas. Moreover, NF1 expression is low in
47% of uveal melanomas [84] and allelic losses are seen
in other types of melanoma [85]. Mutations in NF1 are
enriched in melanoma that have wild-type BRAF and
1709

Oncotarget

NRAS (25% of those had NF1 mutations as reported by
Hodis [32], albeit a relatively small number of patients
was analyzed), suggesting that they could be considered
as driver mutations in this subset that was, until now, not
amenable to targeted therapy approaches. In addition, NF1
mutations or suppression occur in human melanomas that
harbor concurrent BRAF mutations [32, 86]. Mutations
in the NF1 cooperate with BRAF mutations in a mouse
model of melanomagenesis by suppressing BRAFinduced senescence (OIS), promoting melanocyte
hyperproliferation and enhancing melanoma development.
Knockdown of NF1 in vitro promotes activation of both
KRAS and CRAF.

aberrations are often associated with the presence of
BRAFV600E, and cooperate with mutant BRAF in a
GEMM [90], most likely by overcoming OIS associated
with mutant BRAF. In support of this notion, while BRAF
mutations are present in both nevi and melanoma sections
of contiguous nevi-melanoma biopsies, activation of PI3K
(through loss of PTEN expression or activation of AKT3)
was detected in the melanoma portions only [91]. This
indicates that the AKT3/PI3K pathway is activated during
progression to malignant melanoma, most likely as a
means of overcoming OIS. PI3K pathway activation serves
as a rate-limiting event and dual inhibition of PI3K/mutant
BRAF eliminated cells resistant to BRAF inhibition in
vitro [91]. Several mutations in different components of
the PI3K pathway, from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
to PTEN and to AKT3, have been described.

Potential treatment approaches to NFI mutations
In recent studies NF1 could be successfully targeted
in mouse models with a combination of MEK and PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors [86]; a combination of irreversible RAF
inhibition and MEK inhibition was also effective in vivo
[87].

ERBB4
Mutations in this tyrosine kinase receptor are
found in 19% of melanomas, based on the results of
targeted sequencing of the tyrosine kinase family in
seven melanoma tumors [92]. The pattern of mutations,
however, did not exhibit recurrent hot spots. Subsequent
studies have reported either much lower incidence (2% of
271 tumors) of ERBB4 mutations in melanoma [93], or
lack of any in sampling of 117 tumors [94]. Nevertheless,
lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of EGFR, ERBB2, and
other kinases is currently in a clinical trial for advanced
melanoma with ERBB4 mutations (NCT01264081).

Telomerase
Two very recent studies—one based on analysis
of genomic alterations in a melanoma-prone family, the
other based on analysis of the genomic sequence data
from melanoma tumors—have revealed new, frequent,
and unexpected mutations in the regulatory regions of
the catalytic subunit of telomerase [88, 89]. Mutations
were found in 33% primary and 85% metastatic tumors
in the first study versus 71% of all tumors in the second
study. Mutations create a new binding motif for TCF/
ETS transcription factors and result in an increased
transcription from TERT promoter. Mutations in the
promoter region of TERT are considered to be driver
mutations because of their association with familial
melanoma and high frequency in sporadic melanoma.
TERT promoter mutations are not limited to melanoma,
and were found in 16% of tumor cell lines from diverse
cancers [89].

MET
Mutations in MET have not been described in
melanoma, but there is strong evidence that this RTK
is involved in melanoma growth and metastases (see
below: WNT pathway and HGF expression in stroma).
Copy number gains involving MET locus in melanomas
were documented [95]. SU11274, an inhibitor of MET,
has shown significant activity in a xenograft model [96].
Cabozantinib, an inhibitor of MET and other RTKs is in
clinical trials for a variety of cancers with deregulated
RTK signaling. In melanoma, cabozantinib will be trialed
in combination with vemurafenib (NCT01835184).

Telomerase inhibitor imetelstat sodium/GRN163L
(antisense oligonucleotide) is trialed in breast cancer and

Mutations in this RTK were detected in 4.6% of
Chinese melanoma patients (in 351 biopsies sequenced
in the study), mostly in acral and mucosal tumors. All 18
mutations identified were different, which casts a doubt
on their functional significance. However, five of the 12
analyzed had a gain of function effect on PFGFRa in vitro.
These were more sensitive to crenolanib than to imatinib

to play a key role in the predisposition to melanoma in
individuals carrying certain variants of melanocortin-1
receptor (MC1R). The mechanisms through which
MC1R variants associated with red hair and fair skin
predispose to melanoma were not understood until
recently, when it was shown that wild-type but not variant
MC1R protein associates with PTEN and protects it from
degradation after UVB exposure. Disrupted MC1R-PTEN
association was shown to be responsible for the oncogenic
transformation promoted by MC1R variants in presence of
BRAFV600E [106].

MERTK
MER, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) sharing a
family relationship with TYRO3 and AXL, was found
to be expressed at increasing levels during progression
from nevi to metastatic melanoma. Stimulation of MER
with its ligand GAS6 leads to activation of MAPK, PI3K,
and JAK/STAT pathways. Inhibition of MERTK with a
synthetic compound UNC1062 inhibits invasion and
induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro [98]. MERTK
and AXL are expressed alternatively in melanoma [99].
MERTK-expressing melanoma cells are more proliferative
than AXL-expressing cells, though the latter are more
invasive [99].

Other PI3K pathway mutations and alterations.
Mutations in other PI3K pathways genes MTOR,
IRS4, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, and PIK3R5 were detected
in 17% of BRAFV600 and in 9% of NRAS-mutant
tumors [107], even though their functional significance
remains to be determined. Phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase-1 (PDK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that
phosphorylates and activates kinases of the AGC family,
including AKT. Increased expression of PDK1 was
observed in a large cohort of melanoma samples compared
to nevi, and deletion of PDK1in a GEMM of melanoma
BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- significantly delayed development
of tumors and metastases [108].

AKT
Deregulated Akt3 activity was shown to promote
development of malignant melanoma; amplifications of
Akt3 were detected in melanoma [100]. Alterations of
AKT1 and AKT2 are rare, but genetic gain of Akt3 is seen
in 25% of melanoma tumors. A screen of 137 melanomas
and 65 cell lines identified an activating mutation E17A in
AKT1 (one patient) and AKT3 (one patient and two cell
lines), all with concurrent BRAF mutations [101]. High
activity of AKT3 was shown to promote progression of
BRAFV600E-positive nevi to melanoma [102]. A trial
combining MK2206 (Akt inhibitor) in combination with
AZD6244 (the MEK inhibitor selumetinib) is in progress
(NCT01519427).

MAPK pathway downstream of BRAF

MEK1 and MEK2
Sequencing of seven melanoma cell lines and
donor-matched germline cells found MAP2K1 and
MAP2K2 (MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) mutations,
resulting in constitutive ERK phosphorylation and higher
resistance to MEK inhibitors. Screening of a larger cohort
of melanoma tumors revealed the presence of recurring
somatic MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations at an overall
frequency of 8% [109].

PTEN
PTEN is a well-known tumor suppressor affected in
approximately 25% to 30% of melanoma, most commonly
via allelic loss and focal deletions [32, 103]. PTEN is also
deregulated in melanoma via loss of ZEB2, a competitive
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) [104]. In addition, disruptions
of MAGI2, a protein that associates with and stabilizes
PTEN, occur in melanoma [1]. PTEN aberrations are
often associated with the presence of BRAFV600E, and
cooperate with mutant BRAF in a GEMM [90], most
likely providing an OIS inhibitory function by activating
the PI3K pathway. In this model, growth of melanoma
could be inhibited by combined treatment with PD325901
(MEK inhibitor) and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor). PTENinactivating aberrations are not associated with NRAS
mutations, perhaps because the latter lead to activation
of PI3K in the absence of this pathway’s mutations.
PTEN mutations and copy losses are associated with
lower PFS in response to inhibition of mutant BRAF in
patients [105]. PTEN (or rather lack of PTEN) was shown

IQGAP1: a scaffold protein in MAPK pathway as
a possible target
There are new data indicating that it might be
possible to target the MAPK pathway without direct
inhibition of enzymatic activity of kinases in this pathway.
It is well known that kinases usually depend on scaffold
proteins that assemble signaling complexes. One of
these scaffold proteins, IQGAP1 is essential for activity
of ERK1/2, and disruption of IQGAP interaction with
ERK using a small peptide inhibited RAS- or BRAFdriven tumorigenesis and even overcame resistance to
vemurafenib [110].
1711

Oncotarget

RAC pathway

[116]. Significantly, CDK4 pathway is deregulated in
most melanomas as a consequence of increased activity of
ERK or deletion of CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4A (below).
In a clinical study of FOLFIRI (chemotherapeutic agent)
with the nonselective CDK inhibitor flavopirodol in solid
tumors, one melanoma patient had a complete response
[117]. Targeted CDK inhibitors are in clinical development
(PD0332991 (palbociclib), SCH 727965 (dinaciclib),
LY2835219, BAY1000394, LEE011), and are currently
in clinical trials for various advanced cancers including
melanoma.

RAC1 is a Rho GTPase, a GTP exchange protein
known to affect the cell cytoskeleton and motility. Its role
in conveying oncogenic signaling from mutant NRAS in
melanoma was described (Li et al. [111] and references
therein). Recently P29S mutations in the conserved switch
domain were described in melanoma, in 5% of tumors in
the experimental set [32, 112], and their functional role in
vitro was confirmed. Mutations were also found in other
Rho family members-RAC2 (P29L), RHOT1 (P30L),
and in CDC42 (G12D) -making RAC pathway a target
of frequent hotspot mutation. Activity of RAC pathway
is affected not only by mutations, but is regulated by
available cellular pool of GTP, which is controlled
by several enzymes including GMPR (guanosine
monophosphate reductase) which ultimately depletes
cellular GTP pools. High levels of GMPR downregulates
Rho-GTPase levels, and expression of GMPR is lost in
invasive melanoma where activity of RHO pathway
contributes to invasiveness of [113].

TP53 pathway
TP53 mutations are found in 19% of melanoma
tumors [32], a frequency relatively low compared to
other cancers, raising the possibility that melanomas
uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor
suppression. Indeed, several alterations in genes affecting
p53 activity have been discovered in melanoma. Among
them are the long known mutations in p14ARF[118],
overexpression of MDM2 [119], amplification of MDM4
in melanoma[120], elevated expression and the antiapoptotic role of p53-related protein p63 [121], and
increased expression of iASPP [122] -all of which act
to inhibit the function of p53. This means that the rare
“p53 mutant subtype” could now be expanded to a “p53
pathway aberrations” subtype.
CDKN2A locus is frequently deleted in melanoma
of all primary subtypes [123-125]. Two tumor suppressors
are encoded within this locus: p14ARF, which activates
p53 through inhibition of its major negative regulator
MDM2; and p16INK4a, a cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor that activates retinoblastoma (RB) through
negative regulation of CDK4. Loss of CDKN2A was
reported to occur in 16% to 41% of sporadic melanoma
and with a high frequency in familial melanoma [118].
Loss of CDKN2A and CCND1 correlate with poor
responses to dabrafenib [105].

MAP3K5 and MAP3K9
These MAP3 kinases are directly downstream of
Rac and Rho signaling activated by various stress signals.
Mutations and the loss of heterozygosity of MAP3K5
and MAP3K9 in 85% and 67% of melanoma samples,
respectively, suggest inactivation of these kinases. Indeed,
mutants MAP3K5 I780F and MAP3K9 W333* variants
had reduced kinase activity in vitro. Overexpression of
these mutants reduced the phosphorylation of downstream
MAP kinases, while siRNA-mediated depletion of
MAP3K9 in melanoma cells led to increased cell viability
after temozolomide treatment, suggesting that decreased
MAP3K activity acts as a pro-survival adaptation [114].

PREX2

MDM2

Mutations
of
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 were
found in 14% of a cohort of 107 tumors [1]. Functional
studies in vitro have confirmed a role for PREX2 in
melanomagenesis. Presence of mutations in three
functional components of RAC pathways (Rho family
proteins, MAP3K5 and MAP3K9, PREX2) strongly
indicates involvement of RAC pathway in pathogenesis
of melanoma.

This protein binds to p53 and promotes its
degradation and inactivation. MDM2 is considered to be
the major negative regulator of p53. Recently, it has been
reported that in a fraction of melanoma tumors MDM2
expression is upregulated owing to the silencing of a
microRNA, miR-18b, that targets Mdm2 mRNA [126].
The authors suggest that targeted overexpression of miR18b could be considered as a novel strategy for activation
of the p53 pathway in melanoma.

Cell cycle and apoptosis-related genes
CDK4, a cell cycle G1/S kinase, and cyclin D1
(CCND1), were shown to be amplified in melanoma [115].

apoptosis of melanoma in vitro and in vivo [131]. These
findings indicate an alternative strategy for combining
therapies that target MAPK pathway and cyclin B/CDK1
in wild-type p53 melanoma.

In a recent study it was shown that MDM4, a
negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in about 65%
of melanomas, and that melanocyte-specific MDM4
overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse
model of melanoma induced by NRAS [120]. Inhibition
of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function
in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity
to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the
BRAFV600E mutation. MDM4 could be a key determinant
of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and a
promising target for anti-melanoma combination therapy
[120].
Potential treatment of melanoma harboring
inactivated wild-type p53 would involve inhibition of
CDK4, and MDM2-p53 and MDM4-p53 interactions.
The MDM2-p53 interaction has attracted serious efforts
to develop specific inhibitors, of which Nutlin analogues
are the more advanced. The new generations of Nutlinbased drugs are in clinical studies for various solid tumors.
Encouraging results were reported for one of them,
RG7112, in early clinical testing for liposarcoma and
other tumors [127]. Nutlin3, an early prototype inhibitor
of p53-MDM2 interaction, was shown to synergize with
vemurafenib in inducing cell death in melanoma cell lines
and inhibiting tumor growth in vivo [128]. An alternative
approach under development is based on the use of
stapled peptides against MDM2/MDM4, which exhibit
high potency and selectivity [129]. A potent inhibitor of
MDM2 and MDMX interactions, ATSP-7041, reactivated
TP53 function and inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in
vivo [130].
P63, a protein related to p53, has been reported
to have an anti-apoptotic role in melanoma, which is
mediated through its interaction with p53. P63 is expressed
at high levels in melanoma cell lines and clinical samples
and prevents translocation of p53 to the nucleus [121].
This study further expands the role of the aberrations of
the p53 pathway in melanomagenesis.
iASPP is a conserved ankyrin repeat protein that
shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments,
and nuclear iASPP is found in proliferating cells. The
nuclear iASPP was shown to inhibit the pro-apoptotic
function of p53 [122]. High levels of nuclear iASPP
were observed in metastatic melanoma versus primary
melanoma [131]. The researchers found that iASPP is
phosphorylated by cyclin B/CDK1, which promotes its
nuclear localization and binding to p53, inhibiting its proapoptotic function. Prevention of iASPP phosphorylation
by CDK1 inhibitor or knock-down of iASPP induced
apoptotic death in melanoma cell lines, which is further
enhanced by Nutlin3 (inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction
and degradation of p53). Furthermore, inhibition of BRAF
with vemurafenib, or MEK with UO126, potentiated
effects of Nutlin3 and cyclin B /CDK1 inhibition, inducing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NFkB
As in many, many other tumors, the NFkB pathway
is activated in melanoma, but systemic inhibition of
NFkB might have catastrophic general adverse effects and
toxicity. A new facet of NFkB activation was described
recently in drug-treated melanoma cells that might acquire
a senescent secretory phenotype; the latter results in a proinflammatory and pro-metastatic phenotype characterized
by production of CCL-2. Activated NFkB and PARP-1
contribute to this phenomenon and could be involved in
the therapeutic failure [132].

BCL2
There is abundant literature that documents elevated
BCL2 expression in melanoma and its contribution to
melanoma and melanocyte cell survival. A member of
this family, BCL2A1, was shown to be amplified in
30% of melanoma and contribute to resistance to BRAF
inhibition [62] (see section “Intrinsic Resistance to BRAF
and MEK Inhibitors”). Another member of BCL2 family,
BCL2L12 is mutated in 4% of melanomas, but mutation is
synonymous. mRNA from this mutated BCL2L12 is stable
due to failure of targeting by specific miRNA and leads
to higher levels of protein. BCL2L12 binds and inhibits
tumor suppressor TP53 [133].
Attempts to target BCL2 with antisense RNA in
melanoma patients have not been successful. Obatoclax,
a drug inhibiting interaction of BCL2 with pro-apoptotic
proteins Bax and Bak, is in clinical trials for other
malignancies. BH3 mimetics to inhibit function of antiapoptotic proteins, such as BCL2 and BCL-xL, are still
subjects of significant interest. One of them, ABT-737,
resensitized both melanoma cell lines in vitro and tumors
in the in vivo model to common chemotherapeutics
(including the only FDA-approved chemotherapeutic
for melanoma, dacarbazine), leading to marked BIM
(Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) -mediated
apoptosis. ABT-737 may be a beneficial adjuvant therapy
to improve melanoma response rates when conventional
chemotherapy is the only option [134].

β-catenin and WNT pathway
A number of reports have heavily implicated WNT
signaling in melanoma progression and metastases.
β-catenin fortifies the cadherin-based adhesion at the
plasma membrane, but, when detached from cadherins,
1713

Oncotarget

ETV1

activates transcription of target genes, frequently with
oncogenic consequences. Rare mutations in β-catenin
and in other members of the WNT signaling family were
identified in malignant melanoma 10 years ago [135].
β-catenin suppresses expression of p16INK and cooperates
with NRAS in transformation to a frank melanoma [136].
WNT5a, in particular, by binding to the Frizzled4- LRP6
complex, activates ARF6 (guanosine triphosphatase
adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 6), leading to
displacement of β-catenin from N-cadherin in melanoma.
This stimulates signaling from β-catenin and increases
invasiveness [137]. Non-canonical WNT5A signaling was
implicated in the plasticity of melanoma cells expressed as
phenotype switching from expression of ROR1 to ROR2
during hypoxia and acquisition of invasive characteristics
[138]. Moreover, the increased WNT5a signaling and
expression of ROR2 are associated with metastases and
increased resistance to BRAF inhibition [138].
In a mouse melanoma model based on PTEN loss
and BRAFV600E mutation, β-catenin was shown to be
a central mediator of metastases as well as a regulator
of both MAPK and PI3K pathways. Recent findings
established WNT signaling as a metastasis regulator
in melanoma [139]. Mutant BRAF signaling is thought to
inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling. Endogenousβ-catenin
was apparently required for the efficacy of PLX4720 in
vitro; activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling was found to
enhance the anticancer activity of PLX4720 in vitro and
in vivo [140].
Negative regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling
by MAPK pathway was confirmed in an additional
study [141]. Treatment of BRAF-mutant and NRASmutant melanoma lines with WNT3A and the MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 induces apoptosis. The susceptibility
of BRAF- and NRAS-mutant lines to apoptosis correlated
with negative regulation of  Wnt/β-catenin signaling
by ERK/MAPK signaling and dynamic decreases in
abundance of the downstream scaffolding protein, AXIN1
[141]. WNT inhibitors such as PRI-724 (inhibitor of
interaction between β-catenin and CBP) and OMP-54F28
(a fusion protein antagonistic to Fzd8) are starting to enter
clinical testing in tumors other than melanoma.

This transcription factor from the ETS family was
implicated as an oncogene in melanoma and copy-gain
numbers were found in 40% of cases examined, with
amplification of ETV1 in 13% to18% of cases [142].

Other significant genetic abnormalities in
melanoma
NEDD9, an integrin adaptor protein related to
P130CAS, and a member of a family implicated in
pathogenesis of a variety of cancers, was identified as
a bona fide melanoma metastasis gene in melanoma.
NEDD9 enhanced invasion in vitro and metastasis in
vivo of both normal and transformed melanocytes, and
was frequently overexpressed in metastatic melanoma
relative to primary melanoma [143]. Fifty-seven percent of
melanomas were found to have amplification of NEDD9
[95].
PPP6C is a serine-threonine phosphatase, mutated in
12% of sun-exposed melanomas exclusively with BRAF
or NRAS mutations [32, 112]. PPP6C is the catalytic unit
of a phosphatase complex that negatively regulates activity
of the mitotic Aurora kinase, a known oncogene. Most
mutations map in the conserved domain that is involved
in interaction with the regulatory subunit of the complex.
TACC1 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing
protein 1) is mutated in 5% of an experimental set of
121. TACC1 is known to stimulate the PI3K and RAS
pathways and interact with Aurora kinase, which is notable
considering that PPP6C mutations (above) also inactivate
Aurora kinase [32]. At least 16 Aurora kinase inhibitors
are in clinical studies, of which two (MLN8237/alisertib,
GSK1070916A) are investigated in melanoma.
BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein-1/ubiquitin
carboxy-terminal hydrolase) is involved in metastatic
progression of ocular and cutaneous melanoma. BAP1
is a known tumor-suppressor gene. BAP1 mutations are
frequently found in uveal melanoma [144]. Germline
BAP1 mutations have recently been associated with
an increased risk of several cancers, including atypical
melanocytic tumors [145] and uveal melanoma [146].
Uveal melanoma might be sensitive to HDAC inhibitors
[147], and a clinical trial of HDAC inhibitor vorinostat/
SAHA in uveal melanoma is ongoing (phase II
NCT01587352).
SF3B1. Codon 625 of the SF3B1 gene, encoding
splicing factor 3B subunit 1, is consistently mutated in
low-grade uveal melanomas with good prognosis [148].
Mutations of SF3B1 are associated with disomy 3 [149],
are mutually exclusive with BAP1 mutations and lead to
aberrant splicing of transcripts of a number of genes [2].
SNX31 was identified as one of the 11 new
genes mutated in melanoma [32]. It encodes a poorly

Transcriptional factors in melanoma

This universal oncogene and transcriptional master
regulator is overexpressed or present at increased copy

metastatic behavior in vitro and in vivo [152]. Dasatinib,
an SRC inhibitor, was shown previously to exhibit a
higher activity towards YES rather than SRC, and could
be a promising treatment for LKB1-mutated melanoma
[152]. Metformin, an indirect activator of AMPK, the
downstream target of LKB1, is currently in a clinical
trial in combination with vemurafenib (NCT01638676).
Phenformin, another antidiabetic drug that is no longer
in use, also an AMPK activator, has a synergistic activity
with vemurafenib in BRAF mutant melanoma in vitro
and in vivo [153]. It should be noted that earlier studies
found that metformin could be accelerating growth of
NRAS mutant cell lines, and that vemurafenib could have
antagonistic effect in some BRAF mutant melanoma cell
lines, in particular those that are resistant to vemurafenib
[154, 155]
ARID2 is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatinremodeling complex. Loss-of-function mutations were
found in 7% of melanomas. Targeted search identified
mutations in other members of the ARID family (ARID1B,
ARID1A, SMARCA4), altogether amounting to 13% of
the experimental set [32].
TRRAP2. Identified mutations occur in 4% of
the melanoma set examined. TRRAP functions as
part of a multiprotein coactivator complex possessing
histone acetyltranferase activity that is central to the
transcriptional activity of p53, c-Myc, and E2F1 [156].
GRIN2A encodes the glutamate N-methyl-Daspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunit ε-1 that is part

characterized sorting nexin 31 protein. It could be a Ras
effector protein that selectively binds GTP-loaded H-RAS
[150].

STK19
A 5% mutation rate of this kinase gene with
unknown functions is seen in melanoma [32].

LKB1/STK11.
LKB1 might be a central kinase that integrates
energy metabolism and tumor growth, in part through
activation of the family of AMPK kinases. Germline
mutations in LKB1 (STK11) are associated with the
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which includes aberrant
mucocutaneous pigmentation, and somatic LKB1
mutations occur in 10% of cutaneous melanoma [151].
Somatic inactivation of LKB1 with K-Ras activation in
murine melanocytes led to highly metastatic melanoma
with 100% penetrance. AMPK was shown to attenuated
BRAF activity through direct phosphorylation and
disruption of its functionally important association with a
scaffold protein KSR [13]. Downstream events of LKB1
inactivation, in addition to AMPK-related effects, included
increased phosphorylation of the SRC family kinase YES,
increased expression of WNT target genes, and expansion
of a CD24(+) cell population in melanoma with increased

of the class of ionotropic glutamate receptors and bears
the agonist binding site for glutamate. GRIN2A was
found to be mutated in 25% of melanomas [156]; this was
confirmed in another study [114]. Many mutations are
missense or nonsense; therefore, it is unlikely to behave
as a canonical oncogene.
GRM3 is a metabotropic glutamate receptor,
a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that activates
phospholipase C upon ligand binding. It was found
to be mutated in melanoma through exome-capture
analysis of GPCR genes [157]. Mutated GRM3 was
shown to contribute to the proliferation and invasiveness
of melanoma cells in vitro and induce an increased
phosphorylation of MEK. AZD-6244, an inhibitor of
MEK, was able to reduce cell proliferation by inducing
apoptosis in vitro. There is some interest in using available
inhibitors of glutamate release for treatment of melanoma,
since one of them, riluzole, was shown to inhibit growth
of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo [158]. Even
though riluzole was shown to inhibit growth of cell lines
expressing GRM1, a clinical trial is ongoing to explore the
antitumor activity of riluzole in melanoma without prior
analysis of GRM3 status.
Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase PHGDH serves
to divert glycolytic carbon into serine and glycine
metabolism in some cancer cells to supply the increased
biosynthetic needs of transformed phenotype [159]. The
same study found that PHGDH is recurrently amplified
in a genomic region of a focal copy number gain most
commonly found in melanoma. PHGDH catalyzes the
first step in the biosynthesis of serine and subsequent
generation of nucleotides. Melanoma cell lines with
amplified PHGDH had increased flux through the serine
pathway. This pathway, as well as proliferation of cells
with high PHGDH, was sensitive to short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)-mediated knockdown of PHGDH [159].
WEE1. Cell cycle regulatory kinase Wee1 is
upregulated in melanoma and is associated with poor
prognosis [160]. Selective inhibitor of Wee1 MK-1775
showed somewhat promising results as a single agent in
previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma, but
additional trials are not being conducted at this time.
NUAK2 (AMPK-related kinase). High levels of
expression of NUAK2 were found in patients with acral
melanoma and are associated with increased risk of
relapse [161]. NUAK2 knockdown suppresses melanoma
cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo and has
been proposed as a new oncogene in acral melanoma.

expression of this tumor suppressor in melanoma.
Abrogated ZEB2 cooperates with BRAFV600E to
promote melanomagenesis [104]. ADAR1, a protein
of the family known as adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA, is substantially downregulated during metastatic
progression of melanoma. ADAR1 was found to regulate
expression of numerous miRNAs, as well as of the key
miRNA processing protein DICER. Two miRNAS were
implicated in silencing of ADAR1 itself [162]. These
findings reaffirm the significant contribution of epigenetic
miRNA regulation to melanoma pathogenesis.
Strategies to inhibit or increase expression of
ncRNAs in clinical setting are only beginning to emerge.
A growing interest in epigenetic alterations such as
chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and histone
modification regarding their role in melanomagenesis,
might lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets
(reviewed by van den Hurk[163]).

Intrinsic resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors
Resistance to BRAF inhibitors could be intrinsic (as
in lack of response to selective BRAF inhibitors in patients
with BRAF-mutated tumors) or acquired (development of
resistance after treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors).
Both are of the utmost concern. The current understanding
of the origins of intrinsic resistance, as well as possible
approaches to overcoming it, are addressed here (see Table
3).
It is well established that BRAF mutations play a
role in melanomagenesis; however, without additional
genetic alterations, tumor development is restricted by
OIS. As described in the earlier section, and in Table 1,
additional genetic alterations are present in BRAF-mutant
tumors, some of which serve to overcome OIS, and could
play a role in inherent resistance to mutant BRAF and
MEK inhibitors. These two groups overlap, as could be
expected. The necessity of targeting multiple signaling
pathways to overcome drug resistance of aggressive
melanoma was demonstrated in vitro [164]. Genomic
analyses and the informed choice of combinatorial
approaches analyzed in preclinical models are critical in
selecting the right combination of targeted therapies in a
personalized approach to melanoma treatment. In general,
in addition to the MAPK pathway that is deregulated in
most melanomas, the other targets might include any
of the ones listed in Table 1. Experimental evidence
indicating involvement of several pathways/genes in
inherent resistance to BRAF inhibition is cited below in
Table 3.

overcome BRAFV600E-induced OIS and contribute to
inherent resistance to BRAF inhibitors [91]. In particular,
loss of PTEN and consequent loss of expression of the
pro-apoptotic BIM that is distantly regulated by PTEN
were implicated in inherent resistance to BRAF inhibitor
in vitro [165] and to dabrafenib in patients [105]. PTENnegative or AKT3-overexpressing melanomas do not
undergo apoptosis in response to BRAF inhibition and do
not upregulate pro-apoptotic protein BIM. PLX4720 was
found to stimulate AKT signaling in the PTEN-, but not
the PTEN+, cell lines. A clinical trial with inhibitors of
both MAPK and PI3K showed promise in patients with
various solid tumors [166].
A recent study demonstrated an essential role
for ERK-phosphorylated MEK1 (pT292) in membrane
recruitment of PTEN and consequent negative regulation
of AKT [167]. Inhibition of BRAFV600-MEK1-ERK
therefore might lead to the inhibition of the restraining role
that this pathway has on activity of PI3K/AKT pathway
via PTEN.

[169].

Metabolic signature of melanoma sensitive to
mutant BRAF inhibition
An interesting study could not find correlation
between sensitivity to PLX4032 and genetic profiles in a
panel of BRAF-mutant cell lines. However, the sensitive
cell lines had a more profound inhibition of FDG uptake
upon exposure to PLX4032 than resistant cell lines.
This indicates that melanomas with a higher dependence
on glycolysis might be more sensitive to mutant BRAF
inhibition. This also indicates that FDG-PET could be
useful in assessing sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors [170].
Indeed, a clinical study that incorporated FDG-PET
monitoring of responses to vemurafenib strongly indicated
that there is a positive correlation between responses to
therapy (PFS) and reduction in the uptake of FDG [171].

MITF-PGC1a axis in resistance to BRAF
inhibition

CDK4 pathway

Inhibition of BRAFV600 and, to a lesser extent
of MEK, were found to induce expression of genes
involved in citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) in melanoma. Search for factors regulating
OXPHOS revealed that PGC1a is upregulated in resistant
melanoma lines [172]. PGC1a, in turn, was found to be
a direct transcriptional target of MITF [60, 172]. MITF
expression and, as a consequence, PGC1a levels, are
upregulated in melanoma lines and in tumors of patients
treated with Vemurafenib. Inhibition of BRAF leads to
inhibition of glycolytic pathway for ATP production, but
MITF-expressing melanomas can undergo a bioenergetics
adaptation via MITF-PGC1a-OXPHOS upregulation
[172]. The authors suggest targeting OXPHOS in this
group of patients prior to use of MAPK inhibitors because
lines selected to resistance to vemurafenib have elevated
levels of PGC1a.

Increased cyclin D expression mediates inherent
resistance to mutant BRAF inhibition [168], and copy
number changes in CDKN2A, CCND1 correlated with
the shortened duration of PFS in patients treated with
dabrafenib [105].

NF1 mutations
In a mouse model, NF1 ablation decreases the
sensitivity of NF1 wild-type melanoma cell lines to
BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients
following treatment with these agents. Nf1/BRAFmutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors, but are
sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition [86]. In
another study, NF1 mutations were documented in BRAFmutant tumor cells that were intrinsically resistant to
BRAF inhibition, and in melanoma tumors from patients
exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib, thus demonstrating
the clinical significance for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/
MEK-targeted therapies [87].

Tumor stroma influence.
An important study demonstrated production
of HGF by stromal cells in patients with melanoma,
which resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET,
reactivation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, and
resistance to BRAF [173]. Addition of growth factors was
shown to rescue various tumor cells lines from killing
by kinase inhibitors including vemurafenib in melanoma
[174]. High production of HGF was observed in the
stroma samples from patients who had a poor response
to the inhibition of mutant BRAF. In a cellular model,
co-treatment with BRAF and HGF or MET inhibitors
reversed drug resistance [173].

MET and SRC
The activation of MET and SRC signaling was
detected in two patient-derived melanoma cell lines
with BRAFV600E that were resistant to BRAF inhibitor
PLX4032. MET or SRC, respectively, were targeted with
siRNA or drugs in combination with PLX4032. This
was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell
invasion and migration, indicating a functional role for
MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032

its expression is limited to high-MITF-expressing

to overcome the resistance of cell lines with amplified
BCL2A1 to BRAF inhibition.

Inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 might
have a potential role in the future studies aimed to prevent
the development of resistance to BRAF inhibition. The
BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (inhibiting both Bcl2 and Bcl-xL)
sensitizes human melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by
selective BRAF inhibitors, but does not reverse acquired
resistance in vitro [175].

FOXD3-ERBB3
Transcription factor FOXD3 was shown to be
upregulated when mutant BRAF is inhibited in melanoma
cell lines [176]. Subsequent work revealed that FOXD3
directly activates expression of ERBB3, which contributes
to resistance to vemurafenib via activation of PI3K
pathway, with involvement of ERBB2. The latter finding
indicates a possibility of targeting ERBB2 alongside
BRAF to overcome resistance [177].

with intrinsic or acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition
[178]. In lab studies, treatment of melanoma cells with
XL888, the inhibitor of Hsp90, induced apoptosis
more effectively than dual MEK/PI3K inhibition in
several different models of resistance [179]. Multiple
proteins, including PDGFRβ, COT, IGFR1, CRAF,
ARAF, S6, cyclin D1, and AKT, were degraded as a
result of inhibition of Hsp90, which led to the nuclear
accumulation of FOXO3a, an increase in BIM expression,
and the downregulation of Mcl-1. XL888 was effective
against NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro and in
xenografts, most likely by decreasing protein levels of
AKT, CDK4, and WEE1 [180]. XL888 is now in clinical
studies in combination with vemurafenib (NCT01657591).
Another non-geldanamycin Hsp90 inhibitor, STA-9090
(ganetispib), is also in clinical trials.

TGF-β signaling through overexpression of the E3
ubiquitin ligase SMURF2, which resulted in increased
expression of the transcription factors PAX3 and MITF.
High MITF expression protected melanoma cells against
MEK inhibitor cytotoxicity. The study also found
increased SMURF2 expression in advanced stages of
melanoma [183].
Activation of the PI3K pathway was seen as a factor
in resistance of a panel of melanoma cell lines to novel
MEK inhibitor E6201. The sensitivity of cell lines to MEK
inhibition correlated with wild-type PTEN and mutant
BRAF [184].

Acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors
Mechanistic studies have provided insights into the
development of resistance through two major mechanisms:
new mutations in the RAF-MAPK pathway itself and
changes in other oncogenic pathways, mainly RAS and
PI3K, that relieve melanoma cells from reliance on BRAF
signaling [185]. Emergence of resistance in different
tumors from the same patient could involve different
mechanisms and genes [186].
The identification of mechanisms of acquired
resistance to BRAF inhibitors usually involves selection
of surviving cells/clones from BRAF-mutant cell lines
in vitro after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor and
identification of newly acquired mutations or other
somatic changes. Biopsies from relapsed patients are
then analyzed for the presence of these in vitro–identified
changes. Alternatively, biopsies are subjected to massive
sequencing for the identification of newly acquired
mutations/aberrations. A clinical study that examined
mechanisms of developing resistance to vemurafenib
concluded that it resulted mainly from reactivation of
MAPK signaling [187]. Based on findings described
below, it appears that many of the confirmed mechanisms
of resistance are indeed in this category, though activation
of pathways “parallel” to BRAF-MAPK has been
documented (Table 4).

mTORC1
In BRAF-mutant melanoma sustained mTORC1
signaling could be driven by alternative mechanisms of
ERK activation or concomitant activation of the PI3KAkt pathway, thus promoting resistance to RAF and
MEK inhibitors. Activity of mTORC1 after treatment of
melanoma cells in vitro with BRAF or MEK inhibitors
was found to be a faithful predictor of the response as
evidenced by the phosphorylation status of ribosomal
protein s6 [181]. . In patients, suppression of phospho-S6
was significantly associated with improved PFS [182].
Quantitation of p-S6 could serve as a biomarker to guide
treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma. It also suggests that
simultaneous inhibition of mutant BRAF and mTORC1
might be of clinical value. Repeated biopsies would be
needed to predict the effect of MAPK inhibition on
s6 phosphorylation and treatment responses. Report
presented at a recent meeting described the feasibility of
using fine needle tumor aspirates for evaluation of the s6
phosphorylation status (Corcoran R, AACR-NCI-EORTC
International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer
Therapeutics, Abstract C137). Several early-phase clinical
trials examining MEK inhibitors with PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors are recruiting patients (phase I NCT01363232,
NCT01337765, NCT01390818, NCT01392521).

New aberrations in BRAF
Unlike the experiences with other molecularly
targeted therapies of oncogenic kinases, treatment with
BRAFV600E inhibitors did not lead to the emergence
of gatekeeper mutations in BRAF itself. However,
amplification of mutant BRAF was detected in 4 of 20
patients who developed resistance to vemurafenib [188].
Analysis of a subset of cells resistant to vemurafenib
(PLX4032) in vitro detected the 61-kDa variant form of
BRAFV600E, p61BRAFV600E, which lacks exons 4 to
8, a region that encompasses the RAS-binding domain.
p61BRAFV600E shows enhanced dimerization in cells

full-length BRAFV600E that acts as a monomer. The
p61BRAFV600E-splicing variants lacking the RASbinding domain were identified in the tumors of 6 of
19 patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.
These data determined a novel mechanism of acquired
resistance in patients: expression of splicing isoforms of
BRAFV600E that dimerize in a RAS-independent manner
[189].

Enhanced ERBB3 signaling promoted resistance
to RAF pathway inhibitors in cultured melanoma cell
lines and in mouse xenograft models [177]. ERBB3 was
transcriptionally activated by FOXD3, and increased
ERBB3 signaling was dependent on ERBB2. Targeting
ERBB2 with lapatinib in combination with the BRAF
inhibitor PLX4720 reduced tumor burden and extended
latency of tumor regrowth in vivo versus PLX4720 alone.
ERBB3 was shown to be the main RTK undergoing rapid
hyperphosphorylation upon either treatment with a BRAF
inhibitor or with a MEK inhibitor in another publication
[194]. The mechanism of ERBB3 was traced to an
autocrine loop that resulted in production of high levels
of neuregulin by melanoma cells in response to MAPK
pathway inhibition.

Activation of signaling through RTKs

EGFR/SFK/STAT3
BRAF inhibitor–mediated activation of EGFR/SRC
family kinase/STAT3 signaling was shown to mediate
resistance in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines and was
confirmed in patient biopsies. In vitro treatments with an
EGFR inhibitor in combination with a BRAF inhibitor, or
monotherapy with dasatinib, appeared to overcome this
resistance and could deliver therapeutic efficacy in drugresistant BRAF-mutant melanoma patients [190].

PDGFR β activation.

Upregulation of FGFR3 signaling in selected
vemurafenib-resistant cells was described in vitro.
Signaling through FGFR3 activated the MAPK pathway
through RAS, but these cells were still sensitive to
inhibition of MEK or pan-RAF inhibition [191].

Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein, and tyrosine
phosphorylation were detected in a cell line model of
resistance to vemurafenib as well as in short-term cultures
and patient-derived biopsies [193].
NF1 expression is lost in tumors from patients
following treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors
[86]. NF1 mutations were observed in melanoma
tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to
vemurafenib, as already mentioned. However, cells
lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF
inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor [87].

IGF-1R/PI3K pathway

NRAS

Mutations in the IGF-1R/PI3K pathway were
identified as another way for developing resistance to the
BRAF inhibitor SB590885. IGF-1R/PI3K signaling was
enhanced in resistant melanomas; combined treatment
with IGF-1R/PI3K and MEK inhibitors induced death
of BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells. Increased IGF-1R
and pAKT levels in a post-relapse human tumor sample
were consistent with the proposed role for IGF-1R/PI3Kdependent resistance to BRAF inhibitors [192].
Activation of PDGFRβ signaling was shown to
occur during selection for BRAF inhibitor resistance
in vitro. The clones with PDGFRβ activation were also
resistant to MEK inhibition, implying that activation of
PDGFR bypasses the tumor dependence on RAF signaling
entirely [193]. These findings were validated in resistant
tumors [193].

Secondary mutations in NRAS were shown to
confer resistance to PLX4032 in vitro [186, 193]. These
acquired changes were mutually exclusive with PDGFRβ
activation observed in the same study. In contrast to
PDGFR-activated resistant cells, NRAS-mutated cells
were sensitive to MEK inhibitors. Mutations of NRAS
were also found in 4 out of 19 patients that developed
resistance to PLX4032 [193], and in additional patients in
a clinical trial exploring mechanism of acquired resistance
to vemurafenib [187]. New mutant BRAF inhibitors,
such as PLX7904, have been explored in vitro. PLX7904
inhibits ERK1/2 activation in cells with mutant BRAF, but
not in cells with wild-type BRAF [20]. Promisingly, PLX
7904 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mutant BRAF
melanoma cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib/
PLX4720 that is mediated by a secondary mutation in
NRAS.

Activation of AKT3 in response to BRAF inhibitor
PLX4720 or BRAF siRNA was implicated in the resistance
of primary three-dimensional cultures of melanoma cells
to BRAFV600E inhibitors [195]. A novel mutation of
AKT1 was observed in a resistant tumor [196].
ERK activation, independent of classical RAF/
MEK/ERK pathways, was shown to occur in resistant
lines with mutant BRAF. PI3K pathway activation could
be responsible for ERK activity. Inhibition of either
PIK3CA or ERK slowed the growth of these lines selected
in vitro for resistance to PLX4720 [197]. Targeting ERK
activation is a promising strategy to overcome resistance
to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. A new ERK inhibitor,
SCH772984, is active in nanomolar concentrations in vitro
and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. More importantly,
SCH772984 was able to overcome resistance to BRAF or
MEK inhibition in cells and tumors that became resistant
by acquiring mutations in NRAS or MEK1, respectively.
SCH772984 was able to suppress growth of melanoma
cells engineered to contain amplified BRAFV600E
and even growth of melanoma lines selected for double
resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition [198].

Insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) mediate
oncogenic signaling from IGF-1R and are upregulated
in melanoma cell lines resistant to BRAF inhibitors
or derived from patients that developed resistance to
vemurafenib treatment. A new class of drugs that promote
phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1/2 were also able
to overcome acquired resistance to vemurafenib in vitro
[202].

New candidate genes involved in acquired
resistance to BRAF inhibition
A CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out screening identified
additional candidate genes whose ablation conferred
resistance to BRAF inhibitor in melanoma cell
line, including neurofibromin 2 (NF2), Cullin 3 E3
ligase (CUL3), and members of the STAGA histone
acetyltransferase complex (TADA1 and TADA2B).
Previously identified NF1 was a top hit in this screen [203]

MAPK and PI3K adaptive alterations as
predominant resistance patterns

MAP3K8/COT

Recently, large-scale studies of the mechanisms of
resistance to BRAF inhibitor were performed. In one of
them, analysis of 100 biopsies from relapsed melanoma
identified MAPK alterations in 70% of patients, and 22%
had acquired alterations in PI3K pathway [204], including
a novel mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain
of AKT1[196]. The heterogeneity within individual
melanoma tumors contributed significantly to acquired
resistance.
In other studies, mutations in MAPK patwhay were
identified in 51% of relapsed tumors from 45 patients
treated with BRAF inhibitors. These included mutations
in MEK1, MEK2 and in MITF; and in three cases multiple
resistance conferring mutations within same tumor were
observed [205].
Dual “pre-emptive” inhibition of MAPK and PI3K
pathway was suggested as a strategy to induce more
durable responses in melanoma. Interestingly, a proteomic
study of cellular responses has identified DNA damage
response signaling activation in response to dual inhibition
of these pathways [206]. Among the most prominent
responses were activation-related phosphorylation of
ATM, and DNA-dependent protein kinases. Inhibition
of these kinases in vitro enhanced cell death induced by
MAPK and PI3K inhibitors [206].
A trial of a combination of pan-PI3K inhibitor
PX-866 and vemurafenib (NCT01616199) is ongoing;
preliminary results indicate a significant activity,
including in patients previously treated with vemurafenib

In a massive functional kinome screening study,
a kinase known as MAP3K8/COT was implicated in
both inherent and acquired resistance to BRAFV600E
inhibitors. COT is a MAPK independent of RAF and is
expressed highly in inherently resistant melanoma or in
cells from patients with acquired resistance. Its expression
drives resistance to BRAF inhibitors in vitro and occurs
in relapsing patient tumors [199]. COT-mediated
resistance to a RAF inhibitor cannot be overcome by a
MEK inhibitor, suggesting that activation of ERK in these
tumors occurs outside of the classical RAF-MAPK-ERK
pathway. COT might be a direct ERK phosphorylating
kinase.
MEK1 mutation C121S was identified in a patient
treated with vemurafenib [200]. This mutation was shown
to increase kinase activity of MEK1 and confer resistance
to both BRAF and MEK inhibition. Two new mutations
of MEK, E203K and Q56P, were found in tumors that
developed resistance to vemurafenib [187].
RND3
An in vitro study with a single BRAF-mutant
melanoma line showed that BRAF-inhibitor treatments
were associated with reduced expression of RND3, an
antagonist of RHOA activation, and elevated RHOAdependent signaling. Restoration of RND3 expression
or RHOA knockdown attenuated the migratory ability of
residual cells without affecting overall cell survival [201].

was added [210]. The mechanisms of resistance to
dual inhibition of MAPK pathway by vemurafenib or
dabrafenib and trametinib are only beginning to emerge
because relatively few patients were treated with this
combination in the clinical trials.
Alterations in MAPK patwhay were confirmed in
tumors of several other patients treated with dabrafenib
and trametinib. Three of these patients also had acquired
mutations in MAPK patwhay including a MEK2 mutation
[211]. These data suggest addictive dependence of
melanoma on MAPK signaling, and a possibility of
intervention at the level of inhibition of ERKs.
Inherent resistance, partial and low durability
responses, and acquired resistance are major problems
in the clinical development of targeted therapies. Recent
results of clinical studies combining two targeted
therapies have confirmed the long-held belief that
combinatorial approaches have significant advantages
over monotherapy [26, 166]. The obvious limitation of
these studies is that they were, by necessity performed
in vitro, and their results might not necessary translate
into clinical practice. Nevertheless, in a large scale study
of 150 small molecule inhibitors in a panel of 28 early
passage melanoma lines[39] analysis showed that the
most effective drug combination for BRAF-mutant lines
was that of vemurafenib, EGFR, and AKT inhibitors,
which was cytotoxic even in lines with primary resistance
to vemurafenib or in lines selected for resistance to
vemurafenib.

Factors that mediate acquired resistance to MEK
inhibitors (Table 4)
Similar to the adaptation of BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells to BRAF inhibition, resistance to MEK
inhibitors could involve multiple pathways. In a study of
triple-negative breast cancer treated with a MEK inhibitor,
it was found that inhibition of MEK, similar to inhibition
of BRAFV600E in melanoma, induces a reprogramming
of RTK activation [207]. It is possible that activation of
RTK when MEK is acutely inhibited is also involved in
responses of melanoma to MEK inhibition, though this has
not been shown yet.

Mutations in MEK1 and MEK2
De novo mutations in MEK1 were strongly
implicated in resistance to MEK inhibitor selumetinib/
AZD6244, both in treated cell lines and in a metastatic
tumor from a relapsed patient [208]. Mutations in selected
lines resulted in constitutive ERK phosphorylation and
higher resistance to MEK inhibitors, but also conferred
cross-resistance to mutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4023.
Variant MEK1(P124L) was identified in a resistant
metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient
treated with selumetinib.

IMMUNOTHERAPY
Malignant melanoma is a tumor extensively
investigated as target for immunotherapy for reasons
including its high immunogenic potential and the
availability of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
reactive against melanoma antigens [212]. Earliest
approaches had employed active immunization against
the constantly growing repertoire of melanoma regression
antigens [213], but enthusiasm subsided because of
the very modest objective responses to immunization,
mostly obtained for low volume disease [214]. The
puzzling question of why hasn’t successful immunization,
generating tumor-cognate lymphocytes, been yielding
measurable tumor responses led to the recognition of
the inhibitory role of immune check point modulators
expressed on melanoma cells or on activated lymphocytes
[215, 216]. Understanding the role of costimulation
opened a new era in the clinic and an intense search for
additional targets for immunotherapies with improved
efficacy to toxicity ratio.
Interleukin-2 was the earliest immunotherapy for
metastatic melanoma, approved by the FDA in 1998,
followed by interferon-α2b as an adjuvant therapy and
ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) as therapy for
advanced disease, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug

PI3K-AKT pathway
A study in vitro has identified basal and treatmentinduced activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as a
critical regulator of selumetinib sensitivity in BRAFmutant cutaneous melanoma cells. Sensitive, but not
resistant lines showed upregulation of PTEN expression
by selumetinib. Combination of a MEK inhibitor with
inhibitors of Akt, mTOR, or IGF1R was able to overcome
resistance to MEK inhibitors [209].

Factors that mediate acquired resistance to BRAF
and MEK inhibitors (Table 4)
MEK2 mutation Q60P was identified in a patient
that developed resistance to trametinib [210]. Interestingly,
the patient’s progression tumor also acquired amplification
of BRAFV600E. A xenograft tumor derived from a
second patient resistant to the combination of BRAF and
MEK inhibitors contained identical changes. These cells
were resistant to combination treatment with dabrafenib
and trametinib, but responded when mTOR inhibitor

Administration (FDA) for melanoma in March 2011.
While the response rates to IL-2 and ipilimumab given
as a single agent are in the range of 10% to 20% [217,
218], when induced, responses to IL-2 and ipilimumab
are typically long lasting and sometimes complete. The
reasons for lack of response to IL-2 are starting to emerge:
a recent study found that the T cell subset most induced
by IL-2 in melanoma patients is regulatory T cells (Treg)
expressing positive for CD4, CD25, Foxp3 and the
inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS). The high levels
of these ICOS expressing peripheral Tregs was a strong
predictor of the lack of response to IL-2 [219].
In recent years, investigational agents have included
adoptive T cell transfer, blocking antibodies against
inhibitory immune molecules, stimulatory antibodies for
immune cells, and immunization with distinct cancer cell
antigens. Recently, interest in the role of mutated antigens
being more immunogenic and therefore triggering a more
robust immune response, has risen [220]. Identification
and validation of biomarkers predictive of responses to
immunotherapy is a rapidly developing field (reviewed by
Ascierto et al. [221]). These might include a variety of
tumor and tumor microenvironment–specific alterations,
the immune parameters of the individual patient. The
mutational load of a tumor could be also a predictive
factor, as it is plausible that highly mutated tumors are
more immunogenic, therefore triggering a more robust
immune response.
In light of the complexity of the immune response,
it is very likely that combining immunotherapies will be
necessary to induce better clinical responses, but even at
this point it is clear that there is a life-prolonging effect of
immunotherapy in many patients and a potential for cure.

anti-CTLA4 antibody for treatment of melanoma in 2011,
and more so after the recent reports on the clinical efficacy
of antibodies blocking PD-1. Table 5 shows some of the
clinical trials with immune-system-targeting antibodies,
which are described in more detail below.
CTLA4 is an inhibitory molecule expressed on T
cells that is involved in the negative regulation of the T
cell interaction with antigen-presenting dendritic cells
(APCs). CTLA4 inhibits binding of CD28 on T cells to
B7 proteins on APCs, thus weakening the costimulation
of effector T cells. In addition, CTLA4 is expressed on
regulatory T-cells (Treg), and the immune effects of antiCTLA4 may be a combination of enhancing effector
T-cell function while blocking Treg [222]. CTLA4 is
also expressed on tumor cell lines [223] and in human
melanoma [224]; blockade of CTLA4 in vitro induces
apoptosis of melanoma cells, indicating that CTLA4
might have non-immune functions. Available results from
clinical trials indicate that the response rates to CTLA4
blockade with human monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab
and tremelimumab are at most 18%, but overall survival
is superior to what is seen with cytotoxic therapies.
Significant immune toxicities were reported in a number
of trials, and, interestingly, strong association of immunerelated toxicities and responses were observed (reviewed
by Flaherty et al. and Sapoznik et al. [8, 225]).
Potential markers that could predict response to
ipilimumab are of obvious importance. Clinical trial
NCT00261365 incorporated investigation of a number
of parameters in tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment
with ipilimumab. Significant associations were detected
between clinical activity and high-baseline expression of
FoxP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and an
increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [226].
The immunosuppressive role of IDO in the context of
immunotherapies was later shown in the B16 murine
melanoma model [227]. IDO catalyzes tryptophan
degradation and inhibits T cell function. Inhibitors of IDO
INCB024360 and 1-methyl-D-tryptophan are in several
clinical trials for different malignancies, including a

randomized phase I-II trial of combination of ipilimumab
with INCB024360 (NCT01604889).
Trials of ipilimumab and gp100 peptide vaccine—
each as a single agent or in combination—showed limited
responses, but the responses were long lasting. Early-phase
combination trials with ipilimumab include the following
second agents: bevacizumab, high dose interferon
α-2b, IL-2, GM-CSF, anti-PD-1 antibody (see below),
antibody to NK receptor KIR BMS-986015 (in patients
with melanoma or other tumors), immunostimulatory
cytokine IL-21, and even an oncolytic herpes simplex 1
virus (talimogene laherparepvec/T-VEC) —designed to
replicate selectively in tumor cells and to express GM-CSF
(the virus preparation is injectable directly into tumors)
—as well as a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and
surgical/radiotherapy interventions (Supplementary Table
2). Reported results from trial NCT01134614 combining
ipilimumab with GM-CSF showed an increased OS in the
combination arm (ASCO abstract #CRA9007, 2013).
PD-1, like CTLA-4, is an inhibitory receptor;
however, its expression is not limited to T cells and
is found in B cells and some myeloid cells. The PD-1
ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 have different expression
patterns, with PD-L1 found on multiple normal and
cancerous cells including melanoma tumors, where it
provides, once bound by PD-1, peripheral tolerance to
“self” antigens [228]. PD-L2 is expressed on APC cells,
providing tolerance to orally administered antigens.
Interactions between PD-1 and its ligands attenuate
immune responses [229], and, in the context of cancer,
serve to protect tumor cells from cytotoxic T cells. At the
same time, PD-1 is expressed on CD8+ T cells in patients
with metastatic melanoma—particularly within the tumor
microenvironment where they encounter chronic antigen
exposure [230], suggesting that the immune response to
melanoma is inhibited under these circumstances.
Humanized antibodies to PD-1 and PD-L1 have
been developed and tested in clinical trials for several
cancers including melanoma. Anti-PD1 antibody
nivolumab was well tolerated, and the maximum tolerated
dose has not been reached [231]. This study also found a
strong correlation between pretreatment tumor expression
of PD-L1 and responses, with a 36% response rate in
patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, and 0% in the
PD-L1-negative group. However, a larger study of PDL1 expression as a biomarker of response in solid tumors
including melanoma reported that the correlation is not
as solid as reported, because some patients with PD-L1
negative tumors had clinical responses to nivolumab
(http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/113904-132). This
may be because PD-L1 expression in the tumor is dynamic
and is upregulated by factors such as the production of
gamma interferon by infiltrating T cells. The better safety
profile of PD-1 antibody versus CTLA-4 antibody is most
likely due to the fact that the latter targets a peripheral
interaction between T cells and tumor or APCs. Inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of PD-1 probably inhibits peripheral interactions as well,
through PD-L2 on APCs, but it could be expected to
act more locally at tumor sites by preventing inhibition
of tumor-infiltrating PD-1-expressing T cells through
interaction with PD-L1 on tumor cells.

Clinical trials targeting PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction
Preliminary results from an early-phase clinical trial
with anti-PD1 antibody BMS-936558 (MDX-1106, ONO4538, nivolumab) showed durable responses in 28% of
patients with melanoma [232]. Results a from completed
trial reported that 1- and 2-year survival rates were 62%
and 43%, respectively [233]. Currently there are at least
eight trials ongoing with nivolumab for melanoma.
Two other anti-PD-1 antibodies (CT-011: CureTech
Ltd. and MK-3475/lambrolizumab: Merck) are also in
clinical trials. Results of a clinical trial of lambrolizumab
in advanced melanoma produced very promising results.
Of 135 patients treated, 38% had durable responses as
evaluated by RECIST. Remarkably, patients that have
received ipilimumab prior to enrolling in this trial had a
similar response rate. Importantly, lambrolizumab showed
a favorable safety profile [234].
An anti-PD-L1 antibody (MPDL3280A/BMS936559/MDX-1105 is being tested as well. Preliminary
results with anti-PD-L1 antibody showed significant tumor
shrinkage in 21% of 140 patients who had a variety of
cancers; 9 out of 52 melanoma patients had objective and
durable [235]. Recent preliminary results of MDPL3280A
trial showed objective responses in 28% of patients with
melanomas of different origins (45 patients total), but none
in 4 patients with uveal melanoma. Trial NCT01656642
examines combination of MDPL3280A with vemurafenib.
An important study has shown that combining
blockade of both immune checkpoints (PD-1 and
CTLA4) is highly synergistic in rejection of melanoma
tumors in an animal model through strong stimulation
of effector T cells and IFN-g production [236]. AntiPD-1/nivolumab/MK-3475 and anti-CTLA-4/Yervoy
antibodies are being combined in clinical trials with
the hope of synergistic effects (NCT01024231). This
combination treatment, when administered concurrently
to 52 patients at a variety of dose levels, produced an
objective response rate of 40% with 5 complete responses.
The degree of observed tumor shrinkage was more than
80% for most of responding patients. In several patients
in the study, tumors disappeared completely, as could
be determined by imaging. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events
related to therapy occurred in 53% of patients, but were
generally reversible [237]. A randomized phase III trial
NCT01844505 for ipilimumab + nivolumab with the
endpoint of OS is recruiting melanoma patients. Phase II
trial NCT01783938 will explore sequential administration
of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Recent results showing
responses to nivolumab in patients who progressed on

ipilimumab treatment support the schedule of sequential
administration of these antibodies [238]. Ipilimumabrefractory and naïve patients had a similar response rate
of 25% in this trial.
In general, a concept is emerging that different
immune checkpoints might have non-overlapping
functions in immune escape; therefore, targeting more
than one inhibitory molecule might be a general strategy
for future approaches to immunotherapies. In addition to
CTLA and PD-1/PD-L1, other proteins (LAG-3 and TIM3) act as checkpoints. In addition, several proteins listed
below are known to positively modulate T cells function.
There are dozens of molecules now known to upregulate
or downregulate immune responses and future trials
evaluating agonists and antagonists of these molecules in
combination may be promising.
4-1BB. Also known as CD137, 4-1BB is a member
of the TNF receptor superfamily, and is an activationinduced costimulatory molecule. Binding of 4-1BB by
its ligand or antibody induces powerful CD8+ T-cell
activation, IFN-γ production, and cytolytic activity. An
agonistic antibody, BMS-663513 (Bristol-Myers Squibb)
was in clinical trials for melanoma and other tumors.
Safety concerns caused suspension of the trial after several
patients developed liver problems, including high-grade
hepatitis. However, the antibody has promise in expanding
the repertoire of functional CD8+ effector cells during
T-cell expansion for autologous cell transfer (ACT). A
recent study showed that addition of BMS-663513 to the
expansion cultures of T cells isolated from metastases
strongly increased the frequency and yield of CD8+ cells
as well as their cytotoxic activity in vitro [239].
GITR is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed after
T-cell activation that enhances T-cell function and survival.
Importantly, GITR also negatively affects regulatory T
cells (Tregs), and treatment with GITR agonistic antibody
destabilizes intra-tumor Tregs allowing for more efficient
cytolysis by CD8+ T cells [240]. A trial with anti-GITR
antibody TRX-518 is ongoing (NCT01239134).
OX40 is not involved in effector T-cell activation,
but rather, promotes T-cell survival and expansion. In a
clinical study, based at the Portland Providence Medical
Center in Oregon, patients received three infusions of
the agonistic mouse anti-OX40 antibody within a week.
The xenogeneic nature of the antibody precluded further
treatments. Nine of 27 patients experienced minor
tumor shrinkage, although none met RECIST (response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors) criteria for objective
responses.
CD40. Unlike the co-stimulatory targets above,
CD40 is expressed on APCs, while its ligand is expressed
on T cells. Binding of the two acts as a powerful enhancer
of APCs’ ability to present antigens and activate T cells
against foreign targets [241]. A number of cancer patients
with diverse solid tumors have received infusions of
agonistic antibody CP870,893, often in combination with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

conventional chemotherapy, making it difficult to evaluate
the antibody contribution. In those given antibody alone
some objective responses were observed, particularly in a
few patients with melanoma. A surprising finding was that
treatments did not increase numbers of TILs in the tumors.
In a mouse model, antibody treatments induced an influx
of macrophages into tumors, presumably with enhanced
cytotoxic activities. A phase I trial NCT01103635
combining CP870,893 with tremelimumab in melanoma
and other tumors is ongoing. A dose escalation trial
of CP870,893 is ongoing where antibody is combined
with Oncovir poly IC:LC and NY-ESO-1/gp100
NCT01008527.
CEACAM1 is a potential new target for the
development of targeting antibodies. CEACAM1 is a
carcinoembryonic, antigen-related adhesion molecule
1 from the IG superfamily whose expression is absent
from normal melanocytes, but often found in melanomas,
particularly those that are metastatic. CEACAM1 was
shown to protect melanoma cells from T cells in vitro,
and, moreover, its expression was found on T cells and
NK cells from melanoma patients, presumably enabling
a homotypic inhibitory interaction. A mouse antibody
to CEACAM has no apparent effect on CEACAM1expressing melanoma cells in vitro, but renders them
susceptible to elimination by T cells in vitro and in an in
vivo xenograft model. These findings provide a strong
rationale for developing CEACAM1-based therapeutics
for the treatment of metastatic melanoma [225].

Cytokines
Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a protein produced primarily
by CD4+ T-cells that activates and induces proliferation
of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells, is
FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
This is due to the long, durable responses lasting over
10 years in a subset of patients. However, objective
clinical responses to IL-2 alone are under 15% in most
series, and the treatment is related to significant adverse
reactions including pulmonary edema, hypotension, fever,
and chills. In a randomized clinical trial for metastatic
melanoma patients, IL-2 combined with a gp100 peptide
vaccine doubled the clinical responses compared to those
patients receiving IL-2 alone. The vaccine + IL-2 group
also had increased progression-free survival (PFS), but
only a trend towards improved overall survival [242].
Currently, a trial with IL-2 in combination with a MAGE
vaccine containing an improved adjuvant is ongoing.
One interesting small trial combined high-dose IL-2 with
ipilimumab in 36 patients with metastatic melanoma
[243]. The overall response rate of 25% was most notable
because 6 of the 9 responders achieved CRs (CR rate
17%) and all were sustained beyond 6 years. This suggests
that combining stimulatory cytokines with checkpoint
blockade is a strategy worth further investigation.

Interferon-alpha is FDA-approved for the treatment
of stage III melanoma in the adjuvant setting. Interferon
has been shown to increase relapse-free survival (RFS)—
but in most studies, not overall survival. Recently a weekly
pegylated formulation was also FDA-approved for the
same indication. Data suggests that patients with ulcerated
primaries and microscopic compared to palpable nodal
disease are subsets that may benefit most from interferon.
Toxicities of interferon include immune hepatitis, fever,
chills, and fatigue, and the recommended regimen includes
one month of high-dose intravenous therapy followed by
11 months of subcutaneous injections.
Cytokines under investigation for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma include IL-21, which produced an
ORR of 22.5% [244], and is tested both alone and in phase
I trials in combination with anti-CTLA4 (NCT01489059)
and anti-PD1 antibody (NCT01629758). Trials of IL-12
in melanoma, NCT01397708 and NCT01502293, that
deliver various formulations of IL-12 systemically or
intratumorally, have shown some positive responses.

derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [253]; and the nature of
the relevant tumor-rejection antigens being targeted. The
potential of using the presence of the immunostimulatory
marker CD137 on CTL for selection of tumor-reactive T
cells was successfully explored recently [254].
Analysis of the repertoire of T cells in the successful
ACT treatments of three melanoma patients through
exomic sequencing of tumors established a correlation
between the ability of infused T cells to recognize specific
mutated proteins present in tumors. Candidate mutated
epitopes were identified using major histocompatibility
complex–binding algorithm for recognition by TILs [220].
In one patient successfully treated by ACT in a previous
trial, the specific T cells recognizing a mutated epitope
persisted in peripheral blood for over 5 years [255].
A recent phase II clinical trial reported objective
clinical responses in almost half of the 31 patients enrolled,
with two complete remissions and a significant increase
in PFS [256]. The study also analyzed characteristics
of infused T cells associated with significant responses,
and found significant correlations with a higher number
of TIL infused: a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells in
the infusion product; a more differentiated effector
phenotype of the CD8+ population; and, unexpectedly,
a higher frequency of CD8+ T cells co-expressing the
negative co-stimulation molecule “B- and T-lymphocyte
attenuator” (BTLA). A phase I/II trial is investigating the
use of autologous TILs enriched for CD8 and engineered
to secrete IL-12, which will be infused after patients
undergo a myeloablative regimen of chemotherapy
(NCT 01236573). On the other hand, a randomized trial
suggested that use of unselected young autologous T cells
is preferable to enrichment for CD8+ cells because the
latter are more laborious to prepare and did not offer a
therapeutic advantage [257].
Failure of the infused CD8 cells to persist in the
patients could be a major cause for the limited efficacy
of TIL approaches to treatment. In a number of trials this
was addressed by administration of IL-2 after infusion,
or lymphodepletion prior to infusion. To increase the
persistence of infused T cells in patients, an approach
was tested to stimulate CD8+ cells in vitro with MART-1presenting APCs in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15. These
CTLs displayed a memory phenotype, both central and
effector, trafficked successfully to the tumor sites, and
produced a complete response in one of nine patients, as
well as several partial responses and disease stabilization
[258].
Another approach to ACT therapy is to create
tumor-reactive T-cell populations from PBL by retrovirally
transducing them with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)
to tumor-associated antigens or natural T-cell receptors
against antigens presented in the context of MHC.
CAR-modified T cells do not depend on MHC-mediated
antigen presentation, which is frequently dysfunctional in
tumors. The steps and considerations in producing T cells

Adoptive cell transfer
Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) involves the selection
of autologous lymphocytes with antitumor activity, their
expansion/activation ex vivo, and their reinfusion into the
patient, often in the context of lymphodepleting regimens
to minimize endogenous immunosuppression (reviewed
by Galluzzi et al. and Itzhaki et al.[245, 246]). T-celladoptive therapy for metastatic melanoma has been quite
successful in achieving objective regressions in about
50% of patients [247] and produced durable complete
regressions. Despite the clear therapeutic efficacy in
some melanoma patients with ACT, there are a number of
challenges for this approach to become widely accepted
and FDA approved, including the complex methodology
required to manufacture large numbers of T cells, which
has restricted this therapy to a limited number of patients
in a handful of centers. Increased utilization of this
approach will require a simplification and improvement
of the methods for T-cell expansion and a modification of
the treatment regimen associated with decreased toxicity
such as the use of lower doses of IL-2. Importantly, while
it is clear that patients failing anti-CTLA4 can respond to
ACT, future studies will determine whether the same is
true for patients who fail anti-PD1 therapy.
Different aspects of ACT are being examined,
among them the role of cytokines such as IL-15 and
T-cell-produced IL-9 in T-cell-based therapy [248];
concomitant low-dose IL-2 in patients treated with ACT
[249]; facilitation of the long-term engraftment of T
cells by using the memory-T-cell population [250, 251];
the basis for the relapses frequently observed after ACT
immunotherapy, such as inflammation-induced, reversible
loss of melanocytic antigens mediated by TNF-a [252];

with CARs and their advantages as well as pitfalls were
recently reviewed [259]. In melanoma, T cells redirected
to recognize MART-1 have produced significant clinical
responses (reviewed by Strauss [260]). A tumor-testis
antigen on melanoma and other tumors, NY-ESO-1, has
been effectively targeted with an MHC-restricted T-cell
receptor in another trial[261].
Some remarkable responses were observed in
individual patients treated with CD4+ T cells. For
example, autologous transfer of expanded CD4+ T cells
recognizing melanoma antigen NY-ESO-1 produced a
complete and durable response in one patient trial [262].
Recent findings indicate that CD4+ T cells could also
contribute to the success of ACT by inducing tumor
senescence through production of high levels of IFN-γ
and TNF [263].

present in skin­
—or other sources (see below). For
example, an early clinical trial that concluded in 1998
produced promising results. Patients were vaccinated
with monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with tumor lysate
or a mix of tumor-related peptides, and stimulated with
GM-CSF and IL-4. Five of 16 patients had objective
responses [265]. Monocyte-derived DCs were pulsed
with a single tumor peptide from Mage-3A1 and a recall
antigen in another study. Evaluation of immune responses
showed that 8 of 11 patients had an expansion of Mage3A1-recognizing CD8+ T cells, and 6 patients showed
regression of some metastases, but no formal PRs or CRs
were achieved [266]. It was noted that some nonregressing
tumors lacked Mage-3A1 expression and specific T cells.
In a different approach, immature DCs were
generated from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells
through stimulation with a predefined cytokine cocktail,
and matured in vitro by pulsing with a pool of peptides
derived from known melanoma antigens [267]. This study
reported durable immune responses and perhaps one
objective clinical response.
Langerhans cells were directly compared to
monocyte-derived DCs in a clinical trial, and were found
to be similar in terms of eliciting immune responses, but
different in terms of the need for cytokine stimulation
[268]. The role of the route of injection was explored in
a study that injected monocyte-derived, stimulated DCs
either intranodally or intradermally. The latter produced
very low percentages of cells surviving and migrating to
lymph nodes [269], but the induced immune responses
(stimulation of tumor-specific T cells) were superior in the
patients receiving intradermal inoculation [270].
Stimulation of DCs could be performed not
only by exposing them to tumor antigens, but also by
transfection of mRNA coding for the antigens [271]. The
latter might have an advantage of longer exposure and
correct processing of the antigens. Indeed, it was shown
to produce strong immune responses after intranodal
injection, inducing a broad repertoire of IFN-γ producing
TAA-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells [272]. Stage
III melanoma patients in this study also had significant
immune responses.
A recent study reported a further significant
improvement on DC maturation ex vivo. Mature DCs (used
for vaccination) express a specific type of proteasomes, the
immunoproteasomes (iPs) that are responsible for antigen
processing in immune cells. However, tumor cells express
constitutive proteasomes (cPs) that contain three different
subunits. It was hypothesized that generating T cells
against epitopes from one type of proteasome (iPs) might
not result in recognition of epitopes generated by target
cell proteasomes (cPs), preventing optimal recognition
and immune attack of tumor cells. Therefore, the patientderived DCs were transfected not only with the RNA for
tumor antigens, but also with shRNA, which enforced the
default use of only cPs in the DCs. Patients vaccinated

Dendritic cell–based immunotherapy
Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent-presenting
cells in the immune system; clinical efforts to use DC to
induce potent anti-melanoma immune responses have
been ongoing for at least a decade [264]. However, as with
most immunotherapies, the responses to DC-mediated
vaccination have been unpredictable and variable.
Stimulation of anti-melanoma responses by DCs
involves a number of steps that need better scientific
understanding and clinical exploration. To arm DCs with
the antigens needed to be presented to immune effector
cells, DC are usually “loaded” with antigens expressed
in tumors by incubation with the tumor antigens and an
adjuvant ex vivo. This process induces maturation of DCs,
which involves processing the antigens via proteasomal
degradation and presenting them to T cells on a variety
of MHC-family molecules. As so-called “professional
antigen presenting cells”, DCs can present antigen to and
efficiently co-stimulate both CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells.
The T-helper cells could stimulate B-cell-based humoral
responses, and killer T cells could have direct cytotoxic
activity against antigen-presenting tumor cells. DCs can
also react to as well as stimulate the components of the
innate immune system such as NK cells and phagocytes.
Yet other DC interactions can also induce regulatory T
cells that dampen immune responses. Finally, DCs are also
influenced by a large variety of soluble factors, many of
which are abundant in the tumor microenvironment.
A number of variables remain to be fully explored
in DC vaccination: the source of DCs, the optimal
methods for maturation ex vivo, the route of introduction
into patients, the ways to overcome the tumor-generated
immunosuppressory activities, and more.
Clinical trials have explored DCs generated by
different methods and injected by different routes in
patients with metastatic melanoma (only a few are
mentioned here). DCs can be isolated from peripheral
blood and from Langerhans cells—a subset of DCs

with cPs-expressing DCs had lower levels of circulating
melanoma cells and enhanced melanoma-directed T-celllytic activity, which was of a longer duration compared to
patients in control arms of the study. Of the five patients
vaccinated with cPs-expressing DCs, one had a complete
response, and one had a partial response [273].
Another important component of successful
vaccination with DCs is their ability to stimulate CD8+
T cells, which requires production of IL-12-p70 by
DCs, which, in turn, depends on stimulation of DCs
by two signals: CD40 or TLR and INF-γ A recent
small clinical trial used DCs from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of melanoma patients pulsed
with gp100 peptides. In addition, maturation in vitro
included stimulation of DCs from PBMCs with both
CD40L and INF-γ. The study of seven patients showed a
straightforward correlation between the clinical responses
and levels of IL-12 produced by their DCs. The one
patient with complete remission had the highest levels of
IL-12. Moreover, the study has identified the deficiency
in nonresponding patients as the inability to produce IL12
without additional stimulation with TLR agonist. Addition
of poly I:C to the maturation protocol has rescued
production of IL-12 by these DCs in vitro and improved
the clinical outcomes [274].
Although combination immunotherapies involving
DCs and immunomodulatory antibodies may hold
promise [275], overall clinical results with DC vaccines
remain sporadic, anecdotal, and inconsistent. Clinical
investigators continue to struggle with an overwhelming
number of variables, reflecting the complicated biology
and role of this immune cell.

New strategies might include combination of NK transfer
with immunomodulatory antibodies or even transfer
of activated allogeneic NK cells [278]. The cytokineinduced killer cells (CIKs), which can also be isolated
from PBMCs, were recently characterized as a variant NK
subtype that have a cytotoxic activity against autologous
melanoma cells [279].

Influence of targeted therapies on the responses to
immune therapy

BRAF/MAPK signaling and TIL
Activated BRAF/MAPK signaling was shown
to be essential in the development of immune evasion
in melanoma [280]. Prior to clinical development of
BRAF and MEK inhibitors, it was shown that inhibition
of the MAPK pathway leads to increased expression of
melanocytic antigen expression, including MART-1,
gp100, and tyrosinase; whereas enforced expression of
mutant RAF downregulated expression of these antigens
[281]. Mutant BRAF induces expression of IL-1α in
stroma, also leading to immune suppression [282]. In a
mouse model, BRAFV600E induced expression of CCL2,
an immunosuppressive chemokine, while PLX4720
treatment downregulated tumor CCL2 gene expression
and increased numbers of CD8 TILs [283].
There were concerns that treatment with BRAF/
MEK inhibitors might have a direct inhibitory effect
on T-cell function and it was indeed shown later that
treatment with MEK inhibitors, but not BRAFV600E
inhibitors, impairs T-lymphocyte function [284].
A number of subsequent reports have confirmed
that inhibition of mutant BRAF could potentiate immune
responses in melanoma, suggesting that blockade of
immune checkpoints in combination with BRAF inhibitors
could have clinical value. Treatment with BRAF inhibitors
vemurafenib and dabrafenib resulted in markedly
increased numbers of TILs in tumor biopsies obtained
pre- and post-treatment in 15 patients [285]. Another study
found that dabrafenib has no detectable negative impact on
existing systemic immunity or the de novo generation of
tumor-specific T cells in patients [286].
A single report claimed that selective BRAF
inhibition decreases tumor-resident lymphocyte
frequencies in a genetically engineered mouse (GEM)
melanoma model; moreover, treatment with ipilimumab
did not restore the numbers of TIL [287]. Although GEM
models are clearly helpful in studies of targeted therapies,
their utility in the evaluation of immunotherapies is not
clear. It is likely that melanoma’s immunogenicity depends
on the high number of missense mutations inducing
antigens that are recognized as “foreign” by the immune
system, but this feature is not reproduced in most of the

Adoptive transfer of natural killer cells
NK cells are an essential part of the innate immune
system and have been considered in immunotherapies of
melanoma. NK cells in principle are able to recognize
and destroy virally infected or malignant cells without a
need for antecedent antigenic stimulation. However, their
activity, as with other immune effector cells, also depends
on balance of stimulatory or inhibitory factors. NK cells
themselves are regulated by inhibitory receptors, one of
which, KIR (killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors),
is being targeted in a clinical trial with the antagonistic
antibody BMS-986015 that is designed to block the
inhibition by KIR of tumor-cell cytolysis.
NK cells can be obtained from PBMC where they
comprise 5% to 15 % of the lymphocyte population,
expanded and activated in vitro and adoptively
transferred. In fact lymphokine activated killer cells
(LAK cells) given in large numbers 20 years ago were
largely IL-2 activated NK cells [276]. These prior trials,
as well as a more recent trial combining autologous NK
transfer with preparative lymphodepletion, have not
demonstrated benefit attributable to the NK cells [277].

GEM models.
The reported analysis of biopsies taken before and
after treatment with BRAF or BRAF+MEK inhibitors
showed the following: enhancement of melanoma
antigen expression, increase in CD8+ TILs, and
decrease in immunosuppressive cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.
Interestingly, inhibitory PD-1 was increased on T cells and
its immunosuppressive ligand PDL1 was also increased
with BRAF inhibition. This supports the hypothesis that
targeting inhibitory immune interactions may be critical
in augmenting responses to BRAF-targeted therapy in
patients with melanoma [288].

ipilimumab (NCT01400451) was closed in March 2013,
due to dose-limiting liver toxicities [293]. This highlights
the need for careful evaluation of combination strategies,
in particular because the drugs in this trial were approved,
and had little overlap in terms of side effects. Other trials
will evaluate combinations of vemurafenib and anti-PD-L1
antibody MPDL3280A (NCT01656642), vemurafenib and
HD-IL2 (NCT01683188), vemurafenib and adoptive cell
transfer (NCT01585415), HD-IL2 + adoptive cell transfer
+ vemurafenib (NCT01659151), and more. Whether to
give targeted therapy or immunotherapy first to patients
with BRAF mutant melanoma remains an important
clinical question. Patients with rapidly progressing
disease may need to start with BRAF inhibitors since this
treatment works quickly. On the other hand, if the disease
is not rapidly progressing, beginning with immunotherapy
makes sense due to the durability of response in some
patients.
Mutant BRAF and/or its inhibition are not expected
to influence outcomes of all immune therapies. For
example, a recent trial showed that treatment with IL-21
produced an overall response rate of 22.5% in melanoma
and responses were not related to the status of BRAF
[244]. Treatment with high-dose IL-2 was more effective
in patients with NRAS mutations versus BRAF mutations
or WT/WT tumors [294].
Other melanoma-related pathways might also play
a role in responses to immune therapy. Wnt/β-catenin
signaling might be involved in immunosuppression
in melanoma, as high levels of nuclear β-catenin in
melanoma cells impaired maturation of DCs at least in
part through increased production of IL-10 and inhibited
IFN-α production by melanoma-specific CTLs [295]. It
is entirely possible and even likely that other oncogenic
pathways in melanoma also mediate immune suppression
in melanoma.

Adoptive cell transfer therapy and targeted
therapies.
Adoptive cell transfer therapy could also be of more
benefit when combined with vemurafenib, as a mouse
model suggests [289]. In a recent study, vemurafenib
increased MAPK signaling, in vivo cytotoxic activity, and
intratumoral cytokine secretion by adoptively transferred
cells (T cells genetically engineered to recognize tumorexpressing antigens). Another study reported that
administration of PLX4720 significantly increased tumor
infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells in vivo and
enhanced their antitumor activity in a mouse model.
Apparently, PLX4720 negatively affected expression of
VEGF by tumor cells. Importantly, analysis of human
melanoma biopsies before and during BRAF inhibitor
treatment also showed downregulation of VEGF consistent
with the preclinical murine model [290].
An in vitro study analyzed effects of BRAF and
MEK inhibition on function of dendritic cells (DC) in
vitro and found that BRAF-mutant melanomas suppress
immune function of dendritic cells. Inhibition of BRAF,
but not MEK could reverse suppression of DC function.
As has been reported for the effects of MEK inhibition
on T cells [284], inhibition of MEK did negatively
affect DC function and viability. Vemurafenib, but not
MEK inhibitors, was therefore suggested as a preferable
candidate for combination immunotherapy approaches in
BRAF-mutant melanoma. [291].
Another in vitro study examined how vemurafenib
affects the ability of the TILs to recognize autologous
BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro [292].
The results showed a significant increase in recognition
of the inhibitor-treated melanoma cells, attributed to
increased expression of MHC class I-associated proteins
and heat-shock proteins.
These studies in general provide a strong rationale
for combination therapies involving BRAF inhibition
with immunotherapies involving either antibodies to
immunosuppressive molecules or adoptive cell transfer.
Several trials are ongoing, but one has been closed for
toxicity. The phase I trial of concurrent vemurafenib and

Immune environment in melanoma
The role of B cells in immune responses in
melanoma.An extensive study measured humoral B-cell
responses in melanoma patients, and concluded that on
average melanoma patients have highly increased antibody
responses against melanoma cells compared to healthy
volunteers. Interestingly, the B-cell-mediated immune
responses were significantly diminished in patients with
metastatic melanoma versus primary disease [296].
The impaired B-cell functionality with loss of CD27+
(memory) cells was previously reported in metastatic
melanoma [297].
Intratumoral IgG-producing B cells have been
reported in melanoma, but their functional significance
was largely unknown. A study published in March 2013
found a skewing of B cell repertoire in melanoma tumors,
with highly increased numbers of IgG4-producing B cells
relative to normal ratios. High IgG4/IgG total ratios are
1729

Oncotarget

considered a limiting response by the immune system
to contain immune activation. In melanoma, production
of B cells secreting inhibitory IgG4 is stimulated by the
tumor secreted IL-10 and IL-4. The tumor-specific IgG4
even inhibited IgG1-dependent tumor-cell killing through
engagement of the FcγRI effector mechanisms. Moreover,
high circulating levels of IgG4 in serum of patients were
associated with poor prognosis [298].
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells have been
implicated as an important component in suppression of
immune responses in melanoma. Higher frequency of
these cells in advanced melanoma patients is associated
with worse prognosis [299, 300]. Strategies targeting
these cells are being developed, including inhibition of
CSF-1 receptor [301] to improve the efficiency of ACT
in melanoma.

immune interventions. It is reasonable to suggest that
the microenvironment in these tumors is prohibitive for
infiltration of T cells, and seek ways to overcome these
tumor properties. A recent intriguing study showed
that neoadjuvant local irradiation of tumors promotes
recruitment of infused tumor specific CTLs in a pancreatic
transgenic model and xenotransplant model of human
melanoma. In both models, this led to profound inhibition
of tumor progression. The mechanism, investigated in the
pancreatic cancer model only, involved stabilization of
microvasculature and tumor-infiltrating macrophages and
most likely was associated with inflammatory processes
triggered by irradiation. These findings raise a possibility
of using local irradiation (possible only for macroscopic
tumors) or infusion of activated macrophages as means of
promoting CTL recruitment into tumors [306].
The oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV),
injected intra-tumorally, was shown to induce
inflammatory immune infiltrates in not only in injected
tumor, but also in distant tumors in a murine B16
melanoma model. Importantly, NDV showed a strong
potentiating effect on the efficacy of the systemic CTLA4
blockade, resulting in rejection of pre-established distant
tumors. Increase in TILs in the single injected as well in
distant tumors was shown to make them susceptible to
systemic therapy with immune checkpoint modulatory
antibodies. These observations, though limited to a single
model, provide a rationale for exploring the potential of
oncolytic viruses such as NDV in combination treatments
with immune checkpoint antibodies [307].

Immune cell infiltrates in melanoma.
The presence of lymph node–like structures in
solid tumors has been recognized relatively recently, and
is considered to have a prognostic value, in particular as
related to immune therapy [302]. It was suggested that
the presence of these lymphoid structures could be due to
locally tumor-produced chemokines, and could be useful
in selection of patients for whom immunotherapies might
work best. A large study of the TIL grades in primary
melanoma concluded that the high levels of TIL constitute
an independent good prognostic marker of survival not
related to other clinicopatholigic features [303]. Moreover,
a particular 12-chemokine signature produced by tumors
was identified by expression profiling, and was shown
to be predictive of the formation of these lymph node–
like structures. The hope is that this expression signature
might be used for selection of patients for whom longlasting responses to immunotherapy are possible [304].
Recently, the subset of melanoma tumors characterized by
the presence of T-cell infiltrates was found to demonstrate
activation of three immunosuppressive markers:
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), PD-L1, and FoxP3+
regulatory T cells (Tregs). Moreover, expression of these
actually appears to be secondary to the infiltration of
CD8+ T cells, implying that the immune system rather
than the tumor initiates the creation of immunosuppressive
environment [215]. Tregs subset involved in inhibition
of cytotoxic T cells is apparently characterized by
expression of the chemokine receptor CCR4, and CCR4based depletion of these Tregs was successfully used to
stimulate specific anti-tumors immune response [305].
Nevertheless, these findings still support the notion that
tumors with CD8+ T-cell infiltrates could benefit from
treatments with immune-modulatory antibodies and likely
other immunotherapeutic approaches.
The question then arises about the subset of
melanoma patients whose tumors do not contain T
cell infiltrates and are thus not likely to respond to

METABOLISM AND AUTOPHAGY
TARGETS IN MELANOMA THERAPY

AS

There have been few attempts to target melanoma
metabolism with the exception of several known
metabolic preferences listed below. However, recent
discoveries, such as high levels of OXPHOS (oxidative
phosphorylation) in highly aggressive melanoma mediated
by elevated expression of PGC-1a [60], might prompt
more interest in targeting melanoma metabolism. For
many years, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels
were used as a predictive factor to identify melanoma
patients with worsened prognosis, and they presumably
are indicative of the high glycolytic character of tumors,
though the energy requirements of melanoma might be
fulfilled through a more complex relationship between
glycolysis and OXPHOS [308]. The OXPHOS inhibitor
elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel was clinically
tested in a randomized trial in unselected patients. The
study was terminated due to increased death in patients
with high LDH receiving paclitaxel alone [309]. However,
the study revealed a statistically significant increase in PFS
in patients with normal serum levels of LDH receiving
elesclomol, that is, a group of patients with tumors that
1730

rely on OXPHOS.
Regarding the possible effects of metabolic
preferences of melanoma tumors on the efficacy of
targeted therapy, it is of interest that mutant BRAF
inhibition might be more efficacious in tumors with
higher glycolytic index [170, 171]. As mentioned above,
this metabolic trait could be useful as a predictive marker
of response to BRAF inhibition. In addition, inhibition of
BRAF(V600E) appears to induce a switch from glycolytic
to OXPHOS metabolism, via induction of MITF, followed
by MITF induction of PGC1α [172]. A consequence of this
shift is an apparent dependency of BRAF-inhibited cells
upon OXPHOS, thus suggesting new BRAF-combination
strategies for patients. The role of glycolysis in responses
of melanoma to mutant BRAF inhibition were highlighted
in a study that demonstrated that concurrent inhibition
of BRAF and glycolysis induces cell death in BRAF
inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells [310].
The importance of OXPHOS in melanoma
resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy with
vemurafenib was highlighted in another study that aimed
to explore the significance of a subpopulation of melanoma
cells expressing H3K4 demethylase JARID1B. JARID1B
melanoma cells cycle slowly, but can produce progeny of
fast-dividing cells without having other hallmarks of stem
cells [311]. Deeper analysis of these cells revealed that
JARID1B positivity is associated with the post-treatment
surviving fraction, and is marked by increased levels of
OXPHOS which presumably contributes to their survival
[312]. These resistant cells could be successfully targeted
by inhibitors of OXPHOS such as phenformin, similar to
findings in the study described above on MITF induction
of PGCα. Phenformin, no longer used as antidiabetic,
might still hold promise as a drug to combine with BRAF
inhibitors as shown in a recent study [153], where it
selectively eliminated the JARID1B positive cells left
untouched by BRAF inhibition.
A most interesting study implicated enzyme
PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) that links glycolysis to
OXPHOS in the abrogation of mutant-BRAF-induced
senescence (OIS). Oxygen consumption was increased in
senescent cells modified to express mutant BRAF, which
was mediated by activated PDH. Two key PDH-regulating
enzymes were involved in the observed activation of PDH:
inhibitory PDK1 was suppressed, while activating PDP2
was upregulated. Ectopic expression of PDK1 was able to
overcome BRAF-induced senescence of melanocytes and
promote robust tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PDK1
depletion in melanoma tumors dramatically increased
their sensitivity to vemurafenib in vivo by eliminating
subpopulations of cells resistant to the drug [313]. These
results established a direct role for metabolic axis in the
development and drug resistance of melanomas.
The role of autophagy in tumor development and
responses to various treatments remains controversial,
most likely due to the fact that autophagy can contribute
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

either to death or survival of cancer cells depending on
the nature of the death signal and cellular context. A key
autophagy protein ATG5 is reportedly downregulated
in primary melanoma compared to nevi, and early stage
melanomas with low ATG5 levels have worse prognosis
[314]. This would suggest that autophagy in early stages
might be limiting disease progression. Deprivation of
amino acids is considered to be of potential benefit in
melanoma treatment due to specific metabolic preferences/
dependency of melanoma tumors, but induction of
“starvation-induced” autophagy could be detrimental.

Arginine deprivation.
Melanoma tumors, along with hepatocellular cancer
(HCC) and prostate cancer, frequently show deficiency
of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) [315],
cannot synthesize arginine from citrulline, and depend
on exogenous arginine for survival. Arginine degradation
using arginine deiminase (ADI) leads to growth inhibition
and eventually cell death, while normal cells that express
ASS can survive (reviewed by Yoon[316]). Pegylated ADI
(ADI-PEG20) has shown antitumor activity in melanoma
[317]. Another arginine- degrading enzyme, arginase, in
a recombinant-pegylated and cobalt-substituted form,
Co-ArgI-PEG, is being developed for clinical trials.
It is already clear that treatment with ADI-PEG20
induces resistance in patients by at least two identified
mechanisms: induction of protective autophagy and reexpression of ASS and activation of the MAPK pathway
(reviewed by Yoon et al. [316]). If arginine-deprivation
therapy with arginine-degrading enzymes is to become
a valid therapeutic option, concurrent therapies targeting
autophagy or the MAPK pathway should be considered.

Leucine deprivation.
Leucine deprivation was also shown to induce
apoptotic death in melanoma cells; moreover, the
dependence of melanoma cells on leucine was functionally
linked to the activated RAS-MAPK pathway, in particular
BRAFV600E mutation. The latter rendered the mTOR
pathway resistant to leucine deprivation, but inhibition of
autophagy was able to restore sensitivity of these cells to
leucine deprivation. Dietary leucine deprivation combined
with an inhibitor of autophagy suppressed melanoma
xenograft growth in vivo [318].
Autophagy is a potential target in melanoma.
However, drug-induced autophagy could be either
suicidal or protective, which is reflected in the ongoing
clinical studies. Metformin was shown to induce
suicidal autophagy in melanoma cells in vitro and in
vivo [319]. Metformin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial
complex I, activates AMPK as a result of decreased
AMP/ATP ratio, and inhibits mTOR. Long known for
1731

Oncotarget

its antihyperglycemic properties, it is being explored
for antineoplastic activities. A trial of metformin with
vemurafenib is ongoing (NCT01638676). In an opposing
approach, the old antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine,
an inhibitor of autophagy, is also trialed with vemurafenib
(NCT01897116).
Because autophagy is known to be involved in
both innate and adaptive immunity, there is an interest in
exploring manipulation of autophagy for immunotherapy.
Autophagy was reported to enhance antigen presentation
by dendritic cells, therefore potentiating T-cell activation,
and could be enhanced by nanoparticle-based antigen
presentation [320]; autophagosome preparations
enriched for tumor antigens were used to pulse dendritic
cells for successful vaccination of tumor-bearing mice
[321]. On the other hand, inhibition of autophagy was
shown to promote antitumor responses to systemic IL-2
immunotherapy [322, 323]. Apparently, the specific roles
of autophagy in different immune responses would have
to be explored individually.

resected stage IV melanoma patients [329]. Similarly, a
stage III clinical trial found that positivity for at least two
out of three CTC biomarkers (MART-1, GalNAc-T and
MAGE-A3) examined was significantly associated with
decreased recurrence-free survival in patients with stage II
melanoma and metastases to sentinel lymph nodes [330].
These CTC markers were deemed to be useful in selecting
patients for aggressive adjuvant treatments. A different set
of CTC markers (MLANA, ABCB5, TGFbeta2, PAX3d
and MCAM) was examined, and two of them (MLANA
and ABCB5) were also found to be useful in predicting
disease status [331]. At the same time, analysis of
cytokine- receptor expression in CTCs had no predictive
significance for treatment outcomes [332], possibly due to
the choice markers. Overall, the many studies performed
indicate that a validated set of CTC biomarkers as well as
standardized methodology is necessary to make RT-PCR
analysis of CTCs a useful tool in assessment of melanoma
prognosis. For now, RT-PCR of peripheral blood is not
considered to be highly promising.
A different approach involves physical separation
of CTCs prior to their analyses. This methodology is
somewhat limited by its most often used approach, which
relies on expression of certain surface proteins on CTCs
for their identification and separation. CellSearch Veridex
technology, widely used for the detection of CTCs in
blood, was designed for breast, prostate, colorectal, and
lung cancer, which express EpCAM markers. Continuing
expression of these proteins on CTCs could not be
counted upon when de-differentiation (such as epithelial
to mesenchyme transition in epithelial cancers) occurs
during tumor progression. Nevertheless, use of the
CellSearch platform was reported to detect CTCs in 40%
of patients with advanced melanoma, and the number
of CTCs was prognostic itself for overall survival and
reflective of treatment outcomes [333]. The CellSearch
Veridex platform was recently adapted for melanoma
markers, and was reported to be successful in detection
and quantification of CTCs in cerebrospinal fluid in two
melanoma patients with leptomeningial metastases [334]
New techniques are being developed, such as
isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells (ISET), which
was able to detect CTCs in 29% of patients with primary
invasive melanoma and in 62.5% of metastatic melanoma
patients, with an excellent correlation for detection of
CTCs by RT-PCR of tyrosinase [335]. Results obtained
with ISET should, however, be considered carefully,
because circulating melanocytes were detected in the
blood of a patient with untypical melanocytic lesion
[336]. A new technique named photoacoustic blood cancer
testing was successfully applied to melanoma CTCs in
mice and spiked human blood and could be used to capture
CTCs [337, 338]. A recent report described a method to
detect and isolate single circulating melanoma cells that
integrates a polymer-nanofiber-embedded nanovelcro
cell-affinity assay with a laser microdissection (LMD)

NEW PROGNOSTIC MARKERS

Circulating melanoma cells
Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in
melanoma was explored for at least last 20 years. CTCs
have been shown to serve as seeds for metastatic lesions,
and therefore their presence could be interpreted as
a prognostic marker. In addition, monitoring of CTC
levels could serve as a marker of disease progression and
treatment success or failure (reviewed by Ireland et al.
and Tanaka et al.[324, 325]). Molecular profiling of CTC
could become a “liquid biopsy”, and could reflect genetic
heterogeneity, both intratumoral or between multiple
metastatic tumors.
The earlier attempts were directed mostly toward
developing a multimarker RT-PCR to detect and monitor
the presence of CTCs in the bloodstream. The first
detection of melanoma CTCs was based on RT-PCR
of tyrosinase [326]. Numerous studies have employed
RT-PCR of a variety of melanoma markers to analyze
peripheral blood preparations and examine prognostic
significance of these assays. For example, a serial analysis
of two melanoma-associated markers (tyrosinase and
MART-1) was shown to be an independent predictor
of disease recurrence for stage IV melanoma patients
after surgery and adjuvant therapy [327]. A study that
performed serial analysis of CTCs using a five-marker RTPCR (MART-1, GalNAc-T, PAX-3, MITF and MAGE-A3)
concluded that it could be useful for prognostic purposes
[328]. CTC assessment with three markers—MART1, MAGE-A3, and PAX3—provided prognostic
discrimination before and during adjuvant treatment for

technique. This method not only separates melanoma
CTCs from peripheral blood, but also allows sequencing
of individual cells for specific mutations [339].
The inertial focusing–enhanced microfluidic CTC
capture platform, termed “CTC-iChip” is capable of
rapid sorting of rare CTCs from whole blood. The iChip
technology is capable of isolating CTCs using strategies
that involve recognition of extracellular epitopes, but
could be used independently of tumor-specific membraneprotein recognition [340]. The methodology was
successfully tested in epithelial cancer and melanoma, and
enables RNA profiling of single cells. Isolation of CTC
using the ScreenCell filtration technique with quantitative
analysis of CTC telomeres by TeloView was described
recently [341].
Molecular profiling of CTC might provide a very
valuable representation of a tumor(s) genotype because
CTCs presumably reflect tumor heterogeneity better
than a single tumor biopsy. Indeed, several studies have
discovered discordant mutations in CTCs versus biopsies.
Inconsistencies of BRAF and KIT mutations between
tumor biopsies and CTCs were described [342, 343].
Presumably, CTCs also represent tumor cells with higher
metastatic potential, and thus could be more relevant to
the molecular profiling of aggressive tumor variants or
metastases.
Several clinical trials are ongoing that incorporate
CTC detection and analyses prior to and after treatments
to investigate the prognostic value of CTCs. The
CellSearch Veridex technique will be evaluated in terms
of its predictive and prognostic ability (NCT01573494).
CellSearch and Epispot (another platform based
on immunomagnetic separation) are compared in
NCT01558349. Trial NCT01528774 addresses the
possibility of long-term culture of melanoma CTCs
isolated using TrueCells technology. A future trial
NCT01776905 will evaluate use of photoacoustic flow
cytometry for in vivo, real-time detection of CTCs.
Treatment with ipilimumab and stereotactic ablative
radiation therapy (NCT01565837) or with Sargamostim/
GM-CSF will include analysis of CTCs as predictive/
prognostic markers (NCT01489423). Multiple parameters
including CTCs are evaluated in an ongoing trial of
imatininb (NCT00470470).
Recent studies have addressed the utility of yet
another method of “liquid biopsy”, i.e., analysis of
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by NGS techniques
rather than RT-PCR of defined biomarkers. A side-by-side
comparison was performed on the analysis for a serum
biomarker versus analysis of CTCs versus analysis of
ctDNA by targeted- or whole-genomic sequence in breast
cancer patients. This study reported the superiority of
ctDNA analysis, as having a greater dynamic range, a
greater correlation with changes in tumor burden, and
better measure of treatment response [344]. The next
publication from the same group reported monitoring of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ctDNA by exomic sequencing in breast cancer patients
prior to and during treatments [345]. Serial analysis of
ctDNA had successfully detected a number of prognostic
genomic alterations that were either increased or appeared
de novo as a consequence of treatments. It remains to be
seen if detection of ctDNA will be a useful prognostic
companion or even a substitute for tumor biopsies.

Prognostic test for uveal melanoma
Uveal melanoma is a distinct type of melanoma with
a clinical course and molecular landscape of its own. Even
though patients rarely present with metastatic disease and
are routinely subjected to surgery with curative intent,
almost half have a high-risk disease that requires careful
monitoring and/or adjuvant therapy after tumor resection.
It has been difficult to stratify patients into high versus
low risk of metastatic disease based on clinicopathological
findings only.
DecisionDx-UM gene expression profile test was
developed as a stand-alone platform, which requires no
other information for prognostic accuracy. The test is
PCR-based and measures the expression of 12 selected
genes from primary uveal melanoma samples obtained by
fine needle biopsy. The test allows patients to be stratified
into risk categories such that high-risk patients can be
offered intensive metastatic surveillance and adjuvant
therapy while low-risk patients can be spared unnecessary
chemotherapy and frequent monitoring [346].

Exosomes
Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with
an endosome origin that are released by cells into the
extracellular environment. They could fuse with other
cells, thereby transferring the RNAs and proteins
they carry. Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging
mediators of tumorigenesis; there is a growing interest
in exploring treatment options targeting exosomes.
Exosomes are thought to participate in the formation of
a pre-metastatic niche, i.e., a specific microenvironment
that is reprogrammed to support survival and growth of
metastatic cells. There has been significant interest in
exploring the role of exosomes as prognostic markers
(reviewed by Ohno [347]). A recent exciting study
analyzed exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas.
It found that these “metastatic” exosomes increased the
invasive behavior of primary tumors by permanently
“educating” bone marrow progenitors through the receptor
tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also
induced vascular leakiness at premetastatic sites and
reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a provasculogenic phenotype. Reducing MET expression in
exosomes diminished the prometastatic behavior of bone
marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in
1733

circulating bone marrow progenitors from individuals
with metastatic melanoma. The study identified an
exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic
and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4,
HSP70 (HSP90) isoform, and the MET oncoprotein [348].

CONCLUDING REMARKS

REFERENCES

It is very likely, considering the most recent findings,
that the majority of driver mutations in melanoma have
been identified. The study most quoted in this paper [32]
reported that, outside of the most frequent mutations in
BRAF and NRAS, driver mutations were identified in
83% of remaining BRAF and NRAS wild-type tumors.
These results will be confirmed in much larger cohorts of
melanoma tumors; some changes (identification of new
rare-driver or helper mutations) could be anticipated.
Indeed, new mutations are being discovered, such
as recent identification of BRAF fusions in 4-8% of
melanomas without mutations in the known “drivers”.
However, while many genetic alterations in melanoma
have been identified, the issue of tumor heterogeneity,
within different tumors in the same patient, or even within
individual tumor, could be expected to be a big problem
both in melanoma biology and clinical approaches.
However, the accumulated knowledge is already
sufficient to concentrate on the biological significance
of genetic aberrations identified in melanoma and to
evaluate their suitability as targets. Combination therapies
are obviously the way of the future and might include
two or more targeted therapies in combination with
immunotherapies. One can also envision combinations
that include novel therapies that target basic processes
(e.g., metabolism and autophagy) that are sufficiently
deranged in melanoma compared to normal cells.
The ubiquitous problem of resistance to targeted
therapies could only be addressed by dedicated profiling
of both inherent and acquired molecular features
associated with resistance. This is a valid approach to
either forestalling or overcoming resistance to targeted
inhibitors, which is the biggest obstacle to development of
meaningful precision treatment approaches in melanoma
and other cancers.
The great promise of immune therapy in melanoma
treatment is unlikely to be limited to the blockade of
immune checkpoints. Combination of different approaches
to activation of cytotoxic effector cells and inhibition of
negative immune modulation is likely to have a higher
rate of success than a single modality, as exemplified
by combination of two immune checkpoint blocking
antibodies. Biological basis of the sporadic nature of
responses to long-approved immune treatments IL-2 and
Ipilimumab are beginning to be understood, and hopefully
will eventually translate into combination treatment that
will increase the frequency of clinical responses.
