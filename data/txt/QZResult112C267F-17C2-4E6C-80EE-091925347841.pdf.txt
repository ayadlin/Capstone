Abstract
To identify new candidate cancer drug targets, we used RNAi
as a tool to functionally evaluate genes that play a role in
maintaining human tumor cell survival. We screened a small
interfering RNA (siRNA) library directed against f3,700
individual genes to assess the ability of siRNAs to induce cell
death in an in vitro cell cytotoxicity assay. We found that
siRNAs specifically targeting ras-related nuclear protein
(Ran), targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2
(TPX2), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), significantly
reduced the survival of multiple human tumor cell lines.
Further target validation studies revealed that treatment with
Ran and TPX2 siRNAs differentially reduced the survival of
activated K-Ras–transformed cells compared with their
normal isogenic counterparts in which the mutant K-Ras
gene had been disrupted (DKS-8). Knockdown of Ran and
TPX2 in activated mutant K-Ras cells selectively induced Sphase arrest or transient G2-M arrest phenotypes, respectively,
that preceded apoptotic cell death. Given our observations
that Ran and TPX2 depletion preferentially reduces the
survival of activated K-Ras–transformed cells, these two
proteins may serve as useful anticancer targets in tumors
expressing the activated K-Ras oncogene. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
With the advent of large-scale gene knockdown using small
interfering RNA (siRNA) libraries, it has become possible to quickly
identify new cancer drug targets as well as explore their role in
tumorigenesis. Currently, RNAi is being widely used in mammalian
cell–based systems to probe known signal transduction pathways
for the identification of novel genes. Studies using smaller siRNA
libraries identified Akt-cooperating kinases (1), genes influencing
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis–inducing ligand induced
cell killing (2), novel regulators of apoptosis and chemoresistance
genes (3), products involved in endoplasmic reticulum stressdependent apoptosis (4), and a novel familial cylindromatosis
tumor suppressor gene found to negatively regulate nuclear factor
nB (NF-nB) signaling (5). In addition to these smaller scale libraries,
siRNA technology has also rapidly expanded to include systematic,

larger scale gene knockdown in mammalian cells (6, 7). Namely,
retroviral-based siRNA libraries targeting about one third of the
human genome successfully identified genes involved in p53mediated cell cycle arrest (8), human proteasome function (9), and
novel tumor suppressor pathways (10, 11). Generation of large
siRNA libraries based on the processing of long dsRNA by
Escherichia coli RNaseIII endoribonuclease have also been screened
to successfully identify genes required for mitosis (12).
An important issue in using siRNA as a tool for genome-wide
functional screening is the potential for obtaining off-target effects.
Recent studies in the field suggest that siRNA specificity is not
absolute, and off-target effects can be induced by several different
mechanisms that include miRNA-like inhibition of translation
(13, 14), induction of an IFN response (15), and global up-/downregulation of genes arising from high concentrations of siRNA
(16, 17). One of the major factors responsible for off-target effects
is partial sequence cross-hybridization to untargeted transcripts
(18–20). In one of these studies, a detailed analysis of the specificity
of siRNA concluded that perfect matches between the 5¶ end of
antisense siRNA (positions 2–7 or 2–8) and the 3¶ untranslated
region of genes dictated the off-targeting effects (20). Taken
together, these data have strong implications for data interpretation derived from large-scale siRNA library screens. To help
mitigate the potential complications arising from such off-target
effects, general guidelines for good practice in RNAi experiments
are necessary and include correlating phenotypic outcome with
siRNA-mediated knockdown using multiple siRNAs that target
different regions of the same gene and using siRNA at the lowest
possible effective concentration to enhance specificity (21).
To identify new cancer targets, we screened a siRNA library
against 3,700 genes to assess the ability of siRNAs to induce cell
death using an in vitro cell cytotoxicity assay. Many of the initial
hits in the screen were due to off-target effects. Nevertheless, three
hits were identified and confirmed with multiple siRNAs as being
essential for human tumor cell survival. These proteins may serve
as useful cancer targets.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299 and
human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 (American Type Culture
Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Corp.) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). Human colon cancer cell
lines DLD-1 (parental line containing both mutant and wild-type K-Ras
alleles), DKO-1 (containing only mutant K-Ras allele), DKS-8, DKO-3, and
DKO-4 (all containing wild-type K-Ras allele) were obtained from the
laboratories of Dr. Senji Shirasawa and Dr. Takehiko Sasazuki (International
Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified medium with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained at
37jC in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2/95% air.

siRNAs and siRNA library design. Our siRNA library was selected to
target the druggable genome (f3,700 genes), which included protein
kinases, G-protein–coupled receptors, ubiquitin E3 ligases, transporters, ion
channels, peptidases, phophatases, dehydrogenases, nuclear receptors,
lipid-modifying enzymes, integrins, chemokines, and receptors. The siRNAs
against each gene were designed by Dharmacon Research, Inc., using their
proprietary algorithm whereby each mRNA is targeted by a pool of siRNAs
consisting of a combination of four siRNA duplexes directed at different
regions of the gene. siRNA to the polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1) gene (GenBank
accession no. NM_005030) and a universal nontargeting siRNA were used as
positive and negative controls, respectively. Additional siRNAs targeting rasrelated nuclear protein (Ran), GenBank accession no. NM_006325, include

siRNA library screen. H1299 cells were seeded the day before siRNA
transfections at f5  103 cells per well in 96-well plates to obtain 50% to
60% confluency at the time of transfection. The library was screened using
four siRNAs/target as a pool at a concentration of 25 nmol/L each. In brief,
for a single well of a 96-well plate, 6 AL of siRNA and 3 AL of LipofectAMINE
2000 (Invitrogen Corp.) were each incubated separately with 100 AL of OptiMEM (Invitrogen Corp.) for 10 min, mixed together for 20 min at room
temperature, and then 20 AL applied to the cells plated in 100 AL of
medium. The cells were incubated in the siRNA transfection reagent
mixture for 4 to 5 h at 37jC before receiving fresh medium (100 AL). Three

days later, cell death was measured using the Toxilight assay (Cambrex
Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A Z¶ factor was
calculated (0.38) to validate the suitability and robustness of the assay for
high-throughput screening (22). A Z¶ factor is defined as the screening
window coefficient and is reflective of both the signal dynamic range and
the variability in sample data measurements. A Z¶ factor value that is above
zero suggests an assay that is suitable for high-throughput screening (22).
Raw data values were recorded as luciferase units on a 1420 VICTOR
Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Each siRNA transfection
was done in triplicate, spanning three independent 96-well plates, such that
normalized values were averaged for three plates to obtain average fold
increase in cell death relative to control for each siRNA treatment.
Western blotting. Cell lysates were electrophoresed in Novex SDS-PAGE
gels (Invitrogen Corp.), and the proteins were transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was done using a rabbit antiRan polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), an anti-TPX2 antibody
(Rockland Immunochemicals), a mouse anti-SCD1 monoclonal antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich Corporation). Blots were developed using the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent from Amersham Biosciences.
Caspase-3 assay. siRNA-transfected cells in 96-well plates were lysed in
120 AL of 1 lysis buffer [1.67 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 7 mmol/L KCl, 0.83
mmol/L MgCl2, 0.11 mmol/L EDTA, 0.11 mmol/L EGTA, 0.57% CHAPS, 1
mmol/L DTT, 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet; Roche Pharmaceuticals]. After cell lysis, 80 AL of a caspase-3 reaction buffer [48 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 252 mmol/L sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 4 mmol/L DTT, and
20 Amol/L Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate; Biomol Research Labs, Inc.] were
added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37jC. The plates were read
on a 1420 VICTOR Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) at
excitation = 360/40 and emission = 460/40. The fluorescence units relative
to the control were defined as fold increase in caspase-3 activity.
Cell proliferation assay. Inhibition of cellular proliferation was
measured using the ATPlite assay according to the manufacturer’s

instructions (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). siRNA-transfected cells in 96-well
plates were lysed in 100 AL of lysis buffer, and the amount of ATP levels in
live cells was recorded as luciferase units on a 1420 VICTOR Multilabel
Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences).
Flow cytometry analysis. Cell cycle distribution and DNA synthesis
were assessed by propidium iodide labeling and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation, respectively. Approximately 1  106 cells were
pulse labeled with 30 Amol/L BrdUrd (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6-well plates for
1 h at the selected times post-siRNA transfection, harvested, and then fixed
in 70% methanol. Methanol-fixed cells were resuspended in 1 mL of 2 N HCl,
0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 25jC, after which the suspension was
neutralized with the addition of 1 mL of 0.1 mol/L sodium tetraborate
(pH 8.5). Replicative DNA synthesis was detected by staining the BrdUrdcontaining cells with 0.1 mL of FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody
(Becton Dickinson) for 30 min at 25jC. Cells were washed once in 1
washing buffer and resuspended in 800 AL of 1 PBS, 200 AL of propidium
iodide (0.1 mg/mL), and 5 AL of RNase A (10 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich),
incubated in the dark (25jC, 30 min), and analyzed using a Becton
Dickinson ExCalibur flow cytometer.

Results
RNAi-based library screen to identify genes required for
human tumor cell survival. To identify targets involved in human
tumor cell proliferation, we screened a library of synthetic siRNAs
using a cell death assay. Figure 1 depicts representative results
from the library screen. The sample siRNA transfections resulted in
a fairly tight range of data values that equated to a negligible cell
death phenotype, demonstrating that our siRNA library screening
method was tightly controlled. Due to the low background of our
phenotypic screen, we were able to easily detect siRNAs that
induced cell kill at or above 1 SD from the population mean. For
example, treatment with positive control siRNAs against Plk1 and
Eg5 resulted in an approximately 2-fold induction of cell death,
consistent with studies demonstrating a relationship between

inhibition of Plk1 and Eg5 expression and antiproliferative effects
(23, 24). Examples of siRNA hits from our screen that caused a
significant increase in cell death relative to the rest of the
population include Ran, NRAS, RAB6A, RelB, TPX2, ANXA2, and
ANXA4 (Fig. 1A and B). Based on our initial screen of the siRNA
library, 48 hits were identified for further evaluation (f1.3% hit
rate). Retest assessment of these hits was done using lower siRNA
doses ranging from f1.5 to 6 nmol/L to reveal that 23 out of the 48
hits were reproducible and potent at single nanomole-per-liter
doses relative to a scrambled siRNA control (data not shown).
Included in these target hits were Plk1 and STK6 (Aurora A), thus
demonstrating the ability of our screen to detect hits that have
been well established as playing a role in tumorigenesis.
siRNA hit specificity evaluation. Because recent studies have
suggested that siRNA specificity is not absolute and off-target
effects can be induced by several different mechanisms (13–20), we
tested whether our hits were specific. We used siRNA at the lowest
possible effective concentration and correlated phenotypic outcome with siRNA-mediated knockdown using multiple siRNAs that
target different regions of the same gene. To begin choosing the
best hits out of our initial 23, we first assessed the magnitude of the
individual siRNA-induced cell death phenotypes and determined
whether similar effects using multiple siRNAs could be observed in
several different phenotypic assays and cell lines. Four different
siRNA duplexes for each of the 23 different targets were examined
using an apoptosis readout (caspase-3 assay), a cell proliferation
readout (ATPlite assay), and a cell death readout (Toxilight assay).
In these assessments, we found that 10 out of 23 hits passed our
initial criteria in that at least two siRNAs per target reproducibly
induced significant cell death phenotypes in at least two human
tumor cell lines using all assay formats. To determine siRNA
specificity for these top 10 hits, we next examined the correlations
between siRNA-mediated knockdown and cell death phenotypes

with siRNAs (25 nmol/L) against SCD1 or with a universal negative scrambled control siRNA, and cell death was determined 72 h later using an ATPlite assay.
B, H1299 cells were transfected with four different siRNAs against SCD1 using 25 nmol/L dose, and total protein expression levels were determined 72 h
post-transfection using Western blot analysis. C, H1299 cells were transfected with SCD1-3 siRNA using a dose response (0.05–25 nmol/L siRNA), and cell death
was measured 72 h later using a caspase-3 activation assay. D, SCD1 protein expression levels were determined from SCD1-3 siRNA-transfected H1299 cells by
Western blot analysis 72 h post treatment.

Role of Ran, TPX2, and SCD1 in Tumor Cell Survival

Figure 3. siRNAs against TPX2 induce a cell death phenotype that correlates with reduced target protein levels. A, H1299, DLD-1, and MDA-468 cells were
transfected with siRNAs (25 nmol/L) against TPX2 or with a universal negative scrambled control siRNA, and cell death was determined 72 h later using an ATPlite
assay. B, H1299 cells were transfected with four different siRNAs (25 nmol/L dose), and total protein expression levels were determined 48 h post-transfection
using Western blot analysis. C, H1299 cells were transfected with TPX2-3 siRNA using a dose response (0.05–25 nmol/L siRNA), and cell death was measured
72 h later using a caspase-3 activation assay. D, TPX2 protein expression levels derived from TPX2-3 siRNA-transfected H1299 cells were determined at 48 h by
Western blot analysis.

using siRNA doses ranging from 0.5 to 25 nmol/L and found that
only 3 out of these top 10 siRNA hits showed good agreement
between cellular phenotype and target knockdown.
One of these hits was SCD1, a well-defined enzyme that catalyzes
the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty
acids that predominate in triglycerides, phospholipids, and
cholesterol esters. Unbalanced levels of these fatty acids have been
implicated in obesity, atherosclerosis, insulin sensitivity, and
carcinogenesis (25, 26). As shown in Fig. 2A and B, several different
siRNAs inhibited cell proliferation in H1299 and DLD-1 cells that
correlated with SCD1 protein knockdown. This siRNA-mediated
decrease in cell survival correlated with a 3-fold or greater increase
in caspase-3 activity (data not shown). To further confirm that cell
death is mediated by SCD1-specific siRNA, we tested siRNA
potency by treating the H1299 cells with SCD1 siRNA-3 in a doseresponse fashion (0.05–25 nmol/L) and then harvested these cells
for cell death assays and Western blot analysis. These studies
revealed that SCD1 siRNA is active at picomolar concentrations
and can induce cell death as shown by caspase-3 activation in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C and D).
In addition to SCD1, we identified siRNA hits specific to Ran and
TPX2. Ran is a small GTPase that belongs to the RAS superfamily
and plays a critical role in mediating the effects of several mitotic
factors that include TPX2 (27). TPX2 promotes microtubule
assembly around chromosomes by targeting Aurora A kinase to
the spindle microtubules (28). Aurora A plays an important role in
centrosome maturation and in mitotic spindle assembly and serves
as a key regulator of genome stability (29). As shown in Figs. 3A
and 4A, all four siRNAs directed against either TPX2 or Ran
inhibited cell proliferation in multiple human tumor cell lines.
Importantly, the observed siRNA-induced cell death phenotypes
resulted in the reduction of the respective target protein levels

www.aacrjournals.org

(Figs. 3B and 4B). Multiple siRNAs against Ran and TPX2 also
induced caspase-3 activation by at least 2-fold and decreased
colony formation by f50% in soft agar (data not shown). To
further validate the specificities of these siRNAs, H1299 cells were
treated with TPX2 siRNA-3 or Ran siRNA-1 over a range of
concentrations and then harvested for cell death assays (caspase-3
and Toxilight assays) and Western blot analysis. Both TPX2 and
Ran siRNAs induced cell death phenotypes in a dose-dependent
manner, and this correlated well with siRNA-mediated knockdown
of TPX2 or Ran (Figs. 3C and D and 4C and D). Ran siRNA is active
at picomolar concentrations, whereas TPX2 siRNA is active at low
nanomolar concentrations.
TPX2 and Ran are required for cell survival in K-Ras–
activated cells. Because many of the human tumor cell lines
examined in our validation studies contain Ras mutations, we next
investigated whether our hits may cooperate with the Ras
oncogene for cell cycle progression and tumor cell growth. Given
the fact that Ras-activating mutations are one of the more
prevalent genetic changes in cancer (30), data to suggest SCD1,
Ran, or TPX2 as required for cell survival in mutant Ras activated
cells would strengthen these as important anticancer drug targets.
To address this question, we evaluated a pair of human isogenic
cancer cell lines that contain an activated K-Ras allele (DLD-1
parental), or a wild-type K-Ras allele (DKS-8 isogenic counterpart;
ref. 31). Characterization of these lines revealed that they have
similar growth rates as measured by a cell proliferation assay (data
not shown), consistent with previously published observations (31).
Using two different cell death assay formats, we observed that
multiple Ran and TPX2, but not SCD1, siRNAs induced differential
cell killing in the DLD-1 cells expressing a mutant activated K-Ras
versus the control DKS-8 cells expressing wild-type K-Ras (Fig. 5A),
although all siRNAs induced equivalent target knockdown in the

DLD-1 and DKS-8 cell lines (data not shown). These phenotypes
also correlated with an observed 20% to 30% differential in percent
growth inhibition (Fig. 5B). Transfection with a positive Plk1 siRNA
resulted in similar cell death phenotypes in both lines (data not
shown). Increased cell death was also induced by multiple siRNAs
transfected into an additional isogenic cell line that contained only
the activated mutant K-Ras allele (DKO-1), as compared with
isogenic clones containing only the wild-type K-Ras allele (DKO-3,
DKO-4; Fig. 5C), suggesting that TPX2 and Ran may play a role in
the K-Ras–dependent survival pathway.
Ran and TPX2 knockdown in activated mutant K-Ras cells
induces differential cell death that is preceded by either
transient G2-M arrest or S-phase arrest phenotypes. We next
investigated the possible biological mechanisms for the toxicity we
observed with Ran and TPX2 siRNAs in the context of a mutant
activated K-Ras background. Given the role these targets play in
regulating cell cycle progression (27), we hypothesized that
knockdown of Ran and/or TPX2 in the context of activated KRas may exaggerate cell cycle aberrations that trigger apoptotic cell
death. We examined siRNA effects on DLD-1 and DKS-8 cell cycle
progression and DNA synthesis by measuring the incorporation of
BrdUrd-FITC and propidium iodide label into DNA using flowcytometric analysis. Although the distribution of logarithmically
growing cells in G1, S, and G2-M was similar for scrambled siRNAtreated DLD-1 and DKS-8 cells, we observed marked differences in
cell cycle distribution among the isogenic pair treated with TPX2
and Ran siRNAs (Fig. 6). Specifically, we observed that treatment
of DLD-1 cells with TPX2 siRNAs resulted in cells transiently
accumulating in G2-M accompanied by f10% polyploid (8N)
population as early as 24 h. This siRNA-induced accumulation in
G2-M is consistent with previous studies showing that siRNAmediated knockdown of TPX2 results in a mitotic arrest that is
associated with abnormal spindle formation (32, 33). By 48 h,

however, TPX2 siRNA treatment of the K-Ras–activated cells
resulted in the eventual bypass of this G2-M arrest as shown by the
reentry of cells into the G1 phase (Fig. 6). This observed reentry
and, therefore, recycling of K-Ras–activated cells in the absence of
functional TPX2 were associated with enhanced apoptotic cell
death by 72 h (Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, treatment of K-Ras
wild-type DKS-8 cells with TPX2 siRNA resulted in a stable G2-M
arrest by 48 h (Fig. 6), followed by a lesser cell death phenotype at
72 h (Fig. 5A and B). By lengthening the time course study of cell
death up to 6 days, the TPX2 siRNA-transfected DKS-8 cells
maintained the stable G2-M arrest and lesser cell death phenotypes
(data not shown), suggesting that the DLD-1 cells do not simply
reach the stage of cell death more quickly, but rather, the cell death
differential is due to preferential sensitivity to TPX2 depletion.
Marked differences were also seen in cell cycle distribution
between the isogenic K-Ras pair after treatment with Ran siRNA.
In contrast to the DKS-8 siRNA-treated cells, Ran siRNA-treated
DLD-1 cells expressing mutant activated K-Ras resulted in f2-fold
increase in the S-phase population by 48 h as marked by a dramatic
decrease in BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 6). This S-phase arrest was
also associated with a concomitant increase in apoptotic cells by 72
h compared with the siRNA-treated DKS-8 cells (Fig. 5A and B).
Figure 6B and C reveals representative quantitations of cell cycle
populations 24 and 48 h posttreatment of H1299 cells with
scrambled, TPX2, or Ran siRNAs.

Discussion
With the advent of large-scale gene knockdown using siRNA
libraries, it has become possible to systematically screen for genes
that are linked to tumorigenesis and to identify novel drug targets.
Indeed, in this study, we implemented an RNAi-based screen that
resulted in the successful identification of SCD1, TPX2, and Ran as

Role of Ran, TPX2, and SCD1 in Tumor Cell Survival

Figure 5. Screening of Ran and TPX2 siRNAs in K-Ras isogenic clones reveals K-Ras dependence on Ran and TPX2 for cell survival. A and B, Ran and TPX2 siRNAs
were transfected into the K-Ras mutant and K-Ras wild-type isogenic cell lines at 25 nmol/L and assayed 72 h post-transfection by the Toxilight and ATPlite assays.
C, K-Ras disrupted (DKO-1 ) and K-Ras wild-type (DKO-3, DKO-4 ) clones were transfected with Ran and TPX2 siRNAs (5 or 25 nmol/L, respectively). Cell death
was measured at 72 h post-transfection using the Toxilight assay.

playing a role in human tumor cell survival. In addition to these
targets, our existing library undoubtedly contains siRNAs against
multiple other genes essential to tumor cell growth. These
additional hits may have been missed due to the context in which
the screen was done and our selection criteria, namely, screening
the library using a specific cell death assay and a single time point
and assuming that the majority of siRNAs reliably knocked down
the targeted protein at a sufficient level to induce cell death.
Furthermore, one of the main complications arising from RNAibased screens is the lack of siRNA specificity. We have shown in
this study, however, that potentially important targets can be
identified, providing that follow-up experiments are conducted to
check for siRNA specificity.
SCD1 is an enzyme found in the endoplasmic reticulum that is
involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. SCD1 acts in
conjunction with two accessory proteins, flavoprotein cytochrome
b 5 reductase and the electron acceptor cytochrome b 5, to catalyze
the incorporation of a single double bond between carbons 9 and
10 of saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates, producing monounsaturated fatty acids (25). The predominant substrates for SCD1 are
palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA (25). It is well known that monounsaturated fatty acids can serve as mediators of signal transduction
and cellular differentiation, and unbalanced levels of these
mediators have been implicated in obesity, atherosclerosis, insulin
sensitivity, and carcinogenesis (26). In the present study, we have
shown that knockdown of SCD1 protein by siRNA induces a potent
cell death phenotype in vitro, suggesting that endogenous synthesis
of monounsaturated fatty acids may indeed be essential for tumor
cell growth, although further in vivo validation studies are needed.
However, validation for SCD1 as an anticancer target also comes
from recent literature evidence correlating enhanced SCD1

overexpression in a variety of carcinomas (34, 36–38). Studies have
well documented that stearic acid and conjugated linoleic acid
have strong inhibitory effects on mammary carcinogenesis both
in vitro and in vivo, which has been suggested to be due, in part, to
the ability of conjugated linoleic acid to reduce monounsaturated
fatty acids through the reduction of SCD1 activity (39). Saturated
free fatty acids have been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and
promote apoptosis, whereas unsaturated free fatty acids can block
these effects. In other studies, stable knockdown of human SCD1
using antisense cDNA-transfected SV40-transformed human fibroblasts resulted in high levels of triacylglycerol and saturated free
fatty acids. This profile correlated with a slower growth rate, loss of
anchorage-independent cell growth, and enhanced apoptosis (35).
Based on these observations, it has been proposed that an
increased ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty
acids, and hence, a more fluid membrane environment, acts as a
primary trigger of active cell division. Indeed, the lipid products of
SCD1 are used for modulating cell membrane structure and energy
metabolism (25). SCD1 expression is known to be up-regulated by
growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast
growth factors FGF2 and FGF4, and transforming growth factor-h
through a Smad signaling pathway (40).
The other two validated hits, Ran and TPX2, may also serve as
valuable anticancer targets because they both have an integral link
to the Aurora A activation pathway that has been well documented
to be critical in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis (29).
Support for targeting the Aurora A kinase pathway comes from the
proven in vivo efficacy of small-molecule Aurora kinase inhibitors
using human tumor xenograft models (29, 41). Ran is a small
GTPase that belongs to the RAS superfamily that has been found to
be occasionally amplified in common tumors and plays a critical
role in the translocation of macromolecules through the nuclear

pore complex, regulating cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis
(42), suggesting that small molecules targeting Ran in vivo may be
efficacious, but further studies are required. Although it may be
difficult to target the Ran GTPase using small-molecule–based
therapies, it may be possible as suggested by the description of
small-molecule inhibitors against a Rac GTPase shown to inhibit
human tumor cell growth in vitro (43).
The GTP-bound form of Ran (Ran-GTP) also coordinates spindle
microtubule assembly around the chromosomes during mitosis
(44, 45). Nuclear localization of Ran-GTP requires interaction with
regulator of chromosome condensation 1, which is the guanine
nucleotide exchange factor for Ran. In our study, we have shown that

down-regulation of Ran in a variety of human tumor cell lines results
in apoptotic cell death. Given one of its roles in DNA synthesis, one
would expect Ran inactivation to induce aberrations in the cell cycle
that precede apoptosis. Indeed, by expanding our analysis to include
more relevant cell-based models such as the K-Ras isogenic cell line
pair, we found that specific treatment with Ran siRNA differentially
reduced the survival of activated K-Ras–transformed cells (DLD-1)
that was associated with an increase in S-phase arrest compared
with the normal isogenic counterpart, in which the mutant K-Ras
gene had been disrupted (DKS-8). Ran may cooperate with activated
K-Ras to drive tumor cell cycle progression, and disruption of this
synergy results in irreversible S-phase arrest and eventual cell death.

Role of Ran, TPX2, and SCD1 in Tumor Cell Survival

Ran may thus serve as an anticancer target in tumors expressing the
activated K-Ras oncogene, enabling one to better define selective
tumor cell cytotoxicities.
TPX2 is a microtubule-associated protein that serves as one of
the essential downstream targets of Ran-GTP during cell division
and is found to be frequently amplified in common tumors (27, 46).
One recent study identified TPX2 as a potential candidate
oncogene targeted for amplification in both pancreatic and non–
small cell lung cancers based on high-resolution comparative
genomic hybridization analysis (47). This amplification seemed to
correlate with overexpression of genes involved in spindle
formation and mitotic progression such as Bub1 and the Aurora
kinases. In terms of function, TPX2 is normally bound to a nuclear
transport receptor, importin h, via the adaptor protein importin a
that regulates TPX2 import into the nucleus at interphase. The
TPX2-importin complex is dissociated by the binding of Ran-GTP
to importin h, thereby releasing TPX2 to promote microtubule
assembly around chromosomes (27, 46). Indeed, TPX2 has been
shown to play roles in spindle formation using Xenopus egg
extracts and in normal spindle morphology and centrosome
integrity during mitosis using RNAi (32, 33). Interestingly, one of
the main functions of TPX2 is the targeting of the Aurora A kinase
to the spindle microtubules. TPX2-Aurora A interaction leads to
the activation of Aurora A kinase and, in turn, the phosphorylation
of TPX2 by this kinase (28, 48). Aurora A plays an important role in
centrosome maturation and in mitotic spindle assembly, serves as
a key regulator of genome stability, and is frequently amplified in
clinically aggressive tumors (29). TPX2 may thus serve as a valuable
anticancer target in vivo given its direct link in the Aurora A
activation pathway that has been shown to be critical in tumor
progression as shown by the in vivo efficacy of several different
Aurora kinase inhibitors (29, 41). Provided that TPX2 is amenable
to small-molecule inhibitors, targeting TPX2 over Aurora A may
have its advantages given that blocking TPX2 binding to and, thus,
activation of Aurora A kinase provides a higher specificity that may
not be achievable with conventional kinase inhibitors. Nonetheless,

small molecules or siRNAs targeting TPX2 have not been reported,
and it may be difficult to obtain such agents that are
therapeutically useful.
In the present study, we have shown that down-regulation of
TPX2 in a variety of human tumor cell lines results in apoptotic cell
death, and that this phenotype seems to be preferentially enhanced
in activated K-Ras–transformed cells, further strengthening TPX2
as an ideal anticancer target. Mechanistic studies through cell cycle
analysis of a K-Ras isogenic cell line pair revealed that TPX2
knockdown resulted in gross cell cycle aberrations as shown by
a transient G2-M arrest and a small percentage of polyploidy,
followed by reentry into the cell cycle and a concomitant increase
in apoptotic cell death compared with the siRNA-treated wild-type
K-Ras cells. Given that one of the Ras downstream pathways, Raf-1/
mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase kinase/MAP kinase (MAPK), has been implicated to play a
role in driving cells through the G2-M phase (49, 50), coupling TPX2
siRNA-induced spindle formation abnormalities with activated KRas–mediated G2-M progression would be consistent with the
potentiation of cell death.
In summary, our present findings highlight the utility of using
unbiased RNAi-based screens to identify essential survival proteins
that may serve as potentially important targets for cancer therapy.
By expanding our analysis to K-Ras isogenic cell line pairs, we also
show a possible codependence between Ran or TPX2 and K-Ras
expression for cell survival.
