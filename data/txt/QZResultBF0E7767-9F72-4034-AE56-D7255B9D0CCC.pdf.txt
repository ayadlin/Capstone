BACKGROUND. Impairments in geriatric domains adversely affect health outcomes
of the elderly. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a key component
of the treatment approach for older cancer patients, but it is time consuming. In this
pilot study, the authors evaluated the validity of a brief, functionally based screening
tool, the Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13), for identifying older patients with
prostate cancer (PCa) with impairment in the oncology clinic setting.

METHODS. Patients with PCa aged 70 years who actively were receiving androgen
ablation treatment and who were followed within the clinics at the University of
Chicago were eligible. Patients self-completed the VES-13 and CGA instruments

impairment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.90). Patients
who had mean VES-13 scores 3 performed significantly worse on evaluations of
activities of daily living (P ¼ .001), physical performance (P ¼ .002), comorbidity
(P ¼ .004), and cognitive impairment (P ¼ .003).

older patients with PCa who receive androgen ablation in oncology clinics. The

rostate cancer is an age-associated disease. Greater than 70% of all
patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed in men aged >65 years
in the United States.1 The incidence of prostate cancer increases exponentially with age; the probability of developing prostate cancer
increases from 2.2% (1 in 45 men) for those aged 40 years to 59 years
to 13.7% (1 in 7 men) for those aged 60 years.2 Because of more sensitive diagnostic techniques, prostate cancer is being diagnosed more
frequently and at earlier stages.3 These statistics portend a substantial
increase in the number of men who will be diagnosed with prostate
cancer and who will require evaluation for treatment.

The most widely used therapeutic modality in systemic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (ie, biochemical prostate-specific antigen [PSA]-only recurrence after
local therapy or overt metastatic disease) is androgen
suppression by orchiectomy or gonadotropin-releasing
hormone agonists. Although the timing of treatment
initiation for patients with asymptomatic disease is controversial,4 androgen ablation increasingly is employed
earlier in the disease course.5,6 Although older men with
prostate cancer have a higher incidence of low-risk disease characteristics, they are more likely to be treated
with androgen ablation than other modalities, including
watchful waiting.3,7 Because androgen ablation is continued life-long, many men live with the side effects
from androgen ablation for many years.8 These adverse
effects include complications of osteoporosis, sarcopenia, declining physical performance, and potential cognitive effects. The prevalence of functional, cognitive,
and physical impairments in an at-risk population of
older men with prostate cancer undergoing treatment
of androgen ablation is not well documented.
Older patients are a heterogeneous group, and the
spectrum of impairment can range from those who are
independent, to those who are at moderate risk of
health deterioration (vulnerable), and those who are at
a high risk of functional decline or mortality (frail).9–11
Disability and comorbidity have distinct and possibly
synergistic influences on underlying vulnerability and
frailty in the elderly. Disability, or functional impairment, is defined as dependency in performing tasks
that allow for self care and living in the community
and also may include difficulties with physical mobility.
Comorbidity, the concurrent presence of 2 medical
illnesses, usually chronic in nature, is highly prevalent
in older individuals. Frailty, which Fried et al defined as
a state in which patients are highly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes, is a physiologic state in which
there is increased vulnerability to stressors that results
from decreased physiologic reserves.12 Clinical criteria
proposed by Balducci and Extermann to identify frail
elders include age 85 years, dependence in 1 activities of daily living (ADLs), the presence of 3 comorbid
conditions, and the presence of 1 geriatric syndromes
(eg, dementia, incontinence, falls).13 Although definitions still are evolving, vulnerable elders have a greater
likelihood of having modifiable risk factors for health
deterioration than elders who are frail. Therefore, vulnerable elders may be targeted for interventions to improve cancer-related and overall outcomes.
According to the National Cancer Comprehensive
Network guidelines, a multidimensional comprehensive
geriatric assessment (CGA) should be a key part of the
treatment approach for vulnerable older cancer patients.14 The CGA includes evaluation of comorbidity,

803

functional status, physical performance, cognitive ability, psychological status, medication review, and social
support. The benefits of geriatric assessment in older
patients may include prolongation of life and prevention
of hospitalizations and admissions to long-term care
facilities,15–17 prevention of geriatric syndromes,18–20 recognition of cognitive deficit,21 improvement of health
status,22 and detection of unsuspected conditions that
may affect cancer treatment in >50% of patients aged
70 years.23,24 Despite recent studies that demonstrated
the feasibility of CGA in oncology, its adoption as the
standard of care has been slow because of a lack of
resources, difficulties with interpreting results, and difficulties with implementing targeted interventions in specialty clinic settings, such as urology or oncology.25–27 A
short, simple, validated screening procedure that could
be adapted to the specialty clinic setting to quickly identify those patients who are at risk for geriatric disability
would be valuable. With such screening, impaired patients could be offered referral to specific geriatric programs for interventions, whereas older patients who are
not at risk would be spared the more cumbersome CGA.
Currently, little is known about the usefulness of brief
screening tools in selecting those older cancer patients
who would benefit most from the full CGA with targeted
interventions.
The Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) is a selfadministered survey that consists of 1 item for age and
an additional 12 items that assess self-related health,
functional capacity, and physical performance.10,11 In
the national sample of elders from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey that was used to validate the
VES-13, a score 3 identified 32% of individuals as vulnerable.10,11 This identified group had >4 times the risk
of death or functional decline over 2 years compared
with elders who scored <3. Higher scores predict increasing risk for functional decline and/or death.28 The
average time elders took to complete the VES-13 was
<5 minutes.29 Although the utility of the VES-13 compared with a more complete geriatric assessment has
not been tested previously, the VES-13 has been used
in oncology to help with patient selection, risk-stratification, and toxicity evaluation.30 In the current pilot
study, we examined the prevalence of geriatric impairment in older patients with prostate cancer who were
receiving androgen ablation and evaluated the utility of
the VES-13 in identifying impairment compared with
the CGA.

Patients were required to have systemic prostate cancer,
which was defined as having started androgen ablation
for a rising PSA level after local therapy (ie, an increased
PSA level on 2 successive measurements 2 weeks
apart),31 or asymptomatic, metastatic disease. Other
inclusion criteria included adequate command of the
English language, ability to give informed consent, no
history of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy use, and no
other active cancer diagnosis. All patients had to be
receiving their primary oncology care at the University
of Chicago Genitourinary Oncology clinics. Patients
who exhibited severe cognitive impairment, as measured by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
(SPMSQ) (>5 errors),32 and/or who had less than an
8th-grade education, and who did not have a medical
proxy for medical decision-making were excluded from
study participation.
In this cross-sectional, observational study design,
eligible patients were screened with the VES-13 and
completed a standardized CGA. The CGA consisted of
a compilation of reliable and validated tools that assessed major geriatric domains, including functional
status, physical performance, comorbidity, number of
medications, cognition, and social support.32–41 It has
been demonstrated that impairments in these geriatric
domains have a negative impact on health outcomes

in the elderly.17,24,35,38,42–44 Cut-off scores for impairment on the individual assessment tools are associated
prospectively with increased risk for subsequent disability or mortality in the community-dwelling elderly
population (Table 1).
The reliability of the VES-13 in this population was
determined by collecting survey results at a first visit
and then 1 month later. The validity of the VES-13 in
this population was assessed by comparing the VES-13
results with results from a simultaneous CGA. Patients
self-administered surveys, and a trained member of
the research team administered physical and cognitive
performance measures. Any missing responses from
the self-administered portion of the research interviews
were completed in follow-up interviews over the
telephone.
The total score for the VES-13 and scores for each
test within the CGA were recorded. In addition, each
test was scored dichotomously, indicating impairment
or no impairment according to published values. Based
on previous research, meeting the cut-off scores for
impairment in 2 tests within the CGA signifies vulnerability (eg, increased risk for future disability or
mortality).20,21,27,28,35 Impairment on the CGA was
defined as meeting the cut-off scores for impairment
on 2 of 7 individual tests within the CGA. This defini-

Geriatric Disability and Prostate CA/Mohile et al.

tion was chosen to select the cancer patients who were
impaired on multiple geriatric domains who were
most likely to benefit from specific interventions.
Impairment on the VES-13 was not included in this
definition.
Questions that described patient demographics
were included with the first survey. Disease characteristics, including Gleason score (histologic grading of tumor aggressiveness), previous time on androgen
ablation in months, and disease status (ie, asymptomatic, rising PSA without overt metastatic disease vs the
presence of metastatic disease by symptoms or on imaging studies), were extracted from the medical record.
Data were managed in a specific research file that
was stored in an area with access limited to members
of the research team. Participation in the study was
entirely voluntary, and ethical standards for human
participation were followed strictly. The University of
Chicago Institutional Review Board approved the procedures followed.

Analytical Methods
We planned to recruit a sufficient number of participants to provide a suitably precise estimate of the proportion that scored as impaired on the VES-13. A sample
of 50 enrolled participants would provide an estimate of
this proportion to within 6 14%, depending on the
prevalence value. Based on previous research in older
community-dwelling adults, we estimated that >30% of
our sample would score as impaired on the VES-13.11 In
a study of the VES-13 administered to elders who had
similar socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, >60% scored as impaired.45
To examine patient and disease characteristics,
descriptive statistics and summary statistics were employed. Reliability of the VES-13 score was assessed
with the Pearson correlation coefficient. To assess the
contribution of age alone to the total score, we also
examined other subcategories within the VES-13 for
reliability.
To determine the most appropriate cut-off point
for impairment for this sample, a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed. The ROC
evaluated the VES-13 as a screening measure for impairment compared with the CGA (using the definition
of impairment on the CGA as deficits on 2 individual
tests within the battery).21,46 The area under the ROC
curve (AUC) was calculated to reflect the predictive
value of the VES-13 for identifying impairment. An
AUC of 0.5 represents predictive ability no better than
chance, whereas an AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect predictive ability.
The VES-13 score with the most appropriate sensitivity and specificity for identification of impairment

805

was to be used for further analyses. In addition,
because a VES-13 score 3 is associated prospectively
with adverse outcomes in the elderly,11 this score also
was to be included in further analyses. Confirmatory
sensitivity and specificity analyses and positive and
negative predictive values were computed comparing
the screening test, the VES-13, with the gold standard
for diagnosing geriatric risk factors, the CGA. In addition, trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity for
identifying impairment with VES-13 compared with
each test within the CGA were examined. Differences
in results on the CGA battery by group, ie, impaired
versus not impaired on the VES-13 measure, were
obtained by using 2-sample t tests. STATA software
(version 9.0) was used for all statistical analyses.

RESULTS
Sample
Fifty-eight patients consented to participate in the
study, and 50 patients returned completed surveys
and were included in the final data analysis. There
were no obvious differences in age, race, and prostate
cancer characteristics between the 8 patients who
were excluded and the patients who completed study
procedures.
Patient and Disease Characteristics
The patients who participated in this study represented an older age group (ages 70–92 years). The
sample population represented in this study was well
educated and primarily was married. Greater than 33%
of the patients in our sample were African Americans
(Table 2).
Although the majority of patients had intermediate
or higher grade tumors (6) according to Gleason score
criteria, 80% had systemic disease according to PSA criteria only. These patients had no evidence of overt metastatic disease by imaging criteria and had minimal
or no disease symptoms. There was a wide range of
treatment lengths with androgen ablation (range,
3–96 months); however, 80% of men in the sample
had been on androgen deprivation for >12 months.
Distribution of VES-13 and CGA Scores
There was a wide range of scores on the VES-13
within the sample population (range, 0–9). The median
score was 2.5, and the an interquartile ratio was 4.5.
Using scores 3 to signify impairment,10,11 50% of this
population scored as impaired. VES-13 scores within
each category are depicted in Table 3. Reflecting the
older age of this sample, 72% and 24% of patients were
ages 75 years and 85 years, respectively. Forty-two
percent of patients scored the maximum of 2 points
within the physical disability section, and 30% of

patients had difficulty or did not perform 1 of the
tasks that evaluated function.
This sample also was impaired using the CGA as
the gold standard (Table 4). Sixty percent of patients
demonstrated deficits in 2 tests within the CGA. The
median number of impaired tests was 3 (range, 0–7
impaired tests), and 25% of patients were impaired in
4 domains within the CGA.

Reliability of the VES-13 Measure
The reliability of the total VES-13 measure was 0.92
using the Pearson correlation coefficient. After excluding age, which was 1 of the criteria in the VES-13, the
reliability of subcategories within the VES-13 remained
acceptably high (self-rated health, 0.52; physical ability, 0.60; functional ability, 0.70).
Sensitivity and Specificity Analyses
An ROC was constructed to determine the appropriate
VES-13 cut-off point for impairment in this sample and
was designed to compare the VES-13 with the CGA as
the gold standard (Fig. 1). Overall, the VES-13 was
highly predictive for identifying impairment compared
with the CGA, with an AUC of 0.900 (standard error,
0.05; 95% confidence interval for detecting asymptomatic normals, 0.800–0.995). The VES-13 remained predictive for identifying impairment when excluding
patients who scored in the impaired range because of

VES-13 also was predictive for impairment in specific
geriatric domains compared with individual tests within
the CGA (Table 4). Finally, 2-sample t tests were used to
examine group differences in scores on individual
measures within the CGA. Patients who were impaired
by the VES-13 screening measure performed significantly worse on all tests with the exception of social
support (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
A high proportion of older patients with prostate cancer who are receiving androgen ablation have geriatric
impairment that may place them at greater risk for
decline or death. Fifty percent of the sample in this
study met the definition of vulnerability on the VES13 (scores 3), and 60% of patients scored in the impaired range on 2 individual tests within the CGA.
High levels of impairment were noted in measures
that were designed to evaluate the ability of patients

to live in the community independently (Instrumental
Activities of Daily Living), the risk of future disability
and falls (Short Physical Performance Battery),35,40
and the risk for dementia (SPMSQ).32,39,42 Our results
are consistent with 1 other published study by investigators who detected significant disability by administering the CGA to patients with prostate cancer at
various stages of disease.47
The prevalence of impairment in this sample was
greater than that of the original Medicare population.
In the Medicare population, the prevalence of scores
3 was 32% versus 50% in our sample.10,11 This difference may be explained by multiple factors. The sample
in our study was older, and increased age is an important independent predictor of functional decline and
death, even when considering multiple other risk factors. In addition, the proportion of vulnerable older

patients may be higher in urban populations. In a previous study, the VES-13 was administered to 412 older
clinic patients of the University of Chicago South
Shore Geriatrics multidisciplinary clinic.45 The proportion of patients at that geriatric clinic defined as vulnerable according to the screening tool was double the
proportion reported in the original development studies. The prostate cancer sample in our study was similar to that urban geriatric population, because the
oncology clinics serve the same catchment area. Finally,
patients with prostate cancer may have higher impairment levels associated with their disease or treatment
with androgen ablation.
Because of the known differences in our sample’s
characteristics compared with the original studies, we
measured the utility of the brief VES-13 tool to detect
impairment compared with a lengthier, more timeconsuming CGA. We observed that the VES-13 had
high predictive value for identifying impairment

808

CANCER

compared with the CGA using a cut-off score 3 in
our sample. Because of the previously defined clinical
meaningfulness of scores 3,10,11 we chose this score
to signify vulnerability. We also considered other possible cut-off scores: Although a cut-off score 1 had
the highest sensitivity, we did not choose this score
because of its lower specificity and because many
patients scored in the impaired range with this score
based on age alone. Patients who had cut-off scores
between 2 and 4 had testing characteristics that were
very similar (Fig. 1); all of these scores were highly
sensitive and specific and correctly classified approximately 80% of patients. Given the traditional use of
the cut-off score 3 and its comparable testing characteristics, we chose it for further analyses, although
we acknowledge that other cut-off scores may be
equally useful, depending on context. Overall, these
results establish the utility and feasibility of using a
screening measure to detect geriatric impairment in
an older, disease- and treatment-specific cancer population in the specialty clinic setting. Additional studies
to clarify further the testing characteristics of the VES13 using different cut-off scores in other populations
are needed.
It is noteworthy that 24% of the patients were
scored as impaired on the VES-13 solely because they
were aged 85 years. Although a full CGA without
screening, thus, could be advocated for all oldest-old
patients, a screening test like the VES-13 could help identify physical and functional impairments, which may
add additional risk for adverse cancer outcomes, thus
requiring more immediate intervention. In this pilot
study, all patients aged 85 years (n ¼ 12) had additional deficits within the VES-13. In this subset, the median score on the VES-13 was 5.5 (range, from 4 to 9
out of a total possible score of 10). Further prospective
research will be necessary to determine whether functional and/or physical disability adds prognostic value
over age alone within a cancer context. The age 85
years criteria in the VES-13 serves as a reminder for
oncologists that such patients who are receiving care
are at high risk for disability independent of other factors. Such a reminder is an opportunity to improve
oncologic care through attention to geriatric issues.
Overall, the VES-13 remains predictive for identifying
impairment compared with the CGA, even after excluding patients aged 85 years with an ROC AUC of 0.751
(standard error, 0.08; 95% confidence interval for
detecting asymptomatic normals, 0.600–0.901; results
not shown).
The results from this pilot study should be interpreted with caution, because there are limitations in
the study design. Defining a gold standard for the
detection of impairment in geriatric domains is some-

what arbitrary, because there is a plethora of tools for
identifying geriatric deficits. However, our tools are in
common use, validated, and well documented in outcomes literature. Our definition of impaired CGA as 2
tests impaired within the battery, rather than 1 test, is
conservative and would underestimate the sensitivity
of the VES-13 in detecting older prostate cancer
patients with lesser impairment. Patients with multiple
impairments within the CGA are vulnerable and are at
greater risk for future disability, decline, or death.48 In
addition, there is the potential for selection bias. Despite our efforts, we may not have captured all eligible
patients. The patients who were not captured may
have had inherently different characteristics than the
patients who were included, because healthier patients
may not have been recognized as candidates for the
study. This bias would overestimate the levels of
impairment in this older male population. Alternatively, a healthy volunteer bias would underestimate
the prevalence of frailty in this clinical population. The
cross-sectional design and small sample size did not
allow for the establishment of causal links between
patient and disease characteristics and geriatric
impairment. Androgen ablation and its well documented, long-term complications may be associated with
the high prevalence of impairment noted in this
report.49 The research hypothesis that androgen ablation may cause geriatric impairment should be studied
further in prospective study designs.
The current results may not be generalizable to all
elderly cancer patients. Because of varied natural histories and treatment patterns, it will be important to
identify cancer-specific and cancer treatment-specific
measures that identify geriatric impairment. Hurria
et al published a feasibility study that evaluated a geriatric assessment measure for elderly patients who were
receiving chemotherapy, and that measure is being
evaluated currently in a large, prospective trial.26,27
Their work and our study are examples of how future
research may be designed to help select measures for
other elderly cancer populations.
In a sample of older prostate cancer patients who
were receiving androgen ablation, the VES-13 was predictive for identifying vulnerability compared with the
CGA and demonstrated feasibility for use in the specialty clinic setting. The numbers of vulnerable older
patients with cancer will increase as the population
ages50; therefore, it is imperative that we find a better
way to identify older patients who have underlying
geriatric disability, so that we can better determine
appropriate intervention strategies. Further research
will be necessary to examine the relation between
underlying geriatric impairment and outcomes of
elderly cancer patients.
