ABSTRACT
Recent studies showed that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog with
dual activity of inhibiting glycolysis and N-linked glycosylation, can be selectively
taken up by cancer cells and be used as a potential chemo- and radio-sensitizer.
Meanwhile, 2-DG can kill cancer cells under normoxia. However, its efficacy is limited
by the high-dose induced systemic toxicity. Here, we showed that low-dose 2-DG could
be used as a single agent to kill acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, and as a GC
sensitizer to overcome GC resistance under normoxia. Addition of exogenous mannose,
a sugar essential for N-linked glycosylation, rescued 2-DG-treated ALL cells, indicating
that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress
is the main mechanism for 2-DG to induce cell death and reverse GC resistance in ALL
cells. These data provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in GC
resistance. More important, it indicates that 2-DG might be the promising drug for
designing novel high efficiency and low toxic protocol for ALL patients.

INTRODUCTION

resistance, which will help to reduce the intensity of
chemotherapy and then minimize the toxicity of traditional
chemotherapy.
Reprogramming of energy metabolism is a hallmark
of cancer and plays a key role in chemoresistance in
different cancers [7–9]. Cancer cells become dependent on
aerobic glycolysis, making high glucose uptake essential
[10]. Based on this mechanism, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]
fluoro-D-glucose emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)
is used to detect and monitor cancers non-invasively by
visualizing whole body glucose uptake [11, 12]. PET/CT
with 18F-FDG is a powerful tool for the diagnosis, staging,
and follow-up of patients with solid or hematologic
malignancies [13–15]. More important, in addition to
selective uptake by cancer cell, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG)
inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells through inhibition
of glycolysis and N-linked glycosylation [16]. Under
normoxia, 2-DG at a low-concentration is not toxic in
most tested carcinomas, however, it may represent a useful

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents
the most common cancer in children. Recently, ALL
is highlighted as a cancer success story for pediatric
patients, with a 5-year event free survival higher than
80% in most current treatment protocols [1, 2]. However,
still 15–20% of the patients relapse, with a significantly
worse prognosis [3]. A hallmark of relapses is acquired
resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, particularly
glucocorticoids (GCs) [4]. Novel strategies are needed to
overcome chemoresistance, especially GC resistance, and
improve outcome. Moreover, along with the high survival
rate, more and more patients are bearing treatment-related
late effects such as secondary malignancy, cardiotoxicity,
obesity, endocrine abnormalities, reproductive changes,
neurocognitive deficits and psychosocial effects [5, 6].
Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel treatment
options to enhance chemosensitivity and overcome GC

ALL cells

radio- and chemo-sensitizing drug [17, 18]. Our previous
study showed that 2-DG could inhibit glucose uptake and
reverse GC resistance in Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells [19].
In this study, we found that low dose of 2-DG (1 mM)
could induce cell death and overcome GC resistance in ALL
under normoxia. Interestingly, these effects were achieved
mainly by inhibiting N-Linked glycosylation rather than
inhibiting glycolysis. Therefore, 2-DG might be used as
a novel treatment option to overcome GC resistance and
minimize the toxicity of traditional chemotherapy.

More and more studies reported that increased
aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer and plays a role
in chemoresistance in different cancer cells [7–9, 22, 23].
To directly demonstrate if 2-DG treatment can reverse GC
resistance, we incubated ALL and Raji cells with 1 mM
2-DG and/or 1 μM dexamethasone (Dex) for 24 h and
48 h. 2-DG combined with Dex inhibited the viability
of GC resistant cells (Raji, Jurkat, CEM-C1-15, Molt-4)
synergistically (Figure 3A). The coefficient of drug
interaction (CDI) was ranging from 0.61 in the most
sensitive cell line Raji to 0.85 in Jurkat at 48 h (Figure 3B),
indicating that combined treatment produced a significant
synergistic effect in Raji and Molt-4 cells. In GC
sensitive ALL cells, 2-DG and Dex inhibited the growth
of CEM-C7-14 synergistically, the CDI was 0.76 at 24 h
(Figure 3A and 3B). Nalm-6 cells are quite sensitive to both
2-DG and Dex, combined treatment only showed additivity
effect, the CDI was 1.01 at 24 h (Figure 3A and 3B).
GCs exert antileukemic activity through inducing
both apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. To further make sure
that 2-DG can restore the antileukemic effect of GC, we
incubated Molt-4 cells with increasing concentrations of
2-DG (0~1 mM) and/or 1 μM Dex. As shown in Figure 4A,
0.2 mM 2-DG combined with 1 μM Dex did not induce
obviously cell apoptosis. After the concentration of 2-DG
was elevated to 0.4 mM, combined treatment induced
cell apoptosis and cell death synergistically in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 4A and 4B). 0.5 mM 2-DG
combined with 1 μM Dex induced the early apoptotic
rate to 19%, and the cell apoptosis and death rate to 35%
(Figure 4C). When 2-DG was elevated to 1 mM, the early
apoptotic rate elevated to 43% and the cell apoptosis and
death rate elevated to 69% in combined group (Figure 4A
and 4B). Combined treatment induced cell cycle arrested
in G0/G1 phase in all detected cell lines (Figure 4D).
However, 2-DG used alone induced G0/G1 arrest greatly.
Combined treatment showed different effects on cell cycle,
synergistic, additive or even antagonistic in different cell
lines. These results indicated that a very low dose of 2-DG
(0.4 mM) could restore the Dex sensitivity in Molt-4 cells
by inducing cell apoptosis.

RESULTS
Low-dose 2-DG reduces cell viability in ALL
cells under normoxia
Previously, it was reported that 2-DG does not kill
most cancer cells under normoxic condition [17]. To evaluate
the efficacy of 2-DG under normoxic condition, ALL and
Raji cells (B-lineage GC resistant lymphoid cells) were
treated with increasing concentrations of 2-DG for 24 h and
48 h, followed by assessment of cell viability using 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assays. As shown in Figure 1, 2-DG induced cell
viability inhibition under normoxic condition in all tested
cells in a dose and time dependent manner (Figure 1A) with
an IC50 (concentration that inhibits 50% ) ranging from
0.22 mM in the most sensitive cell line Nalm-6 to 2.70 mM
in CEM-C7-14 at 48 h (Figure 1B).

Low-dose 2-DG induces cell death and G0/G1
phase arrest in ALL cells
T-ALL always has a poor prognosis [20]. Molt-4,
a GC resistant cell line, established from the peripheral
blood of a 19-year-old man with T-ALL in relapse [21],
is sensitive to 2-DG treatment (Figure 1). Therefore,
we selected Molt-4 cell line to investigate the antileukemic mechanism of 2-DG. Along with the increasing
concentration of 2-DG (0~1 mM), cell viability decreased
from 100% to 44% (Figure 2A), G0/G1 phase increased
from 61% to 90% (Figure 2B), Annexin V positive and
propidium iodide (PI) negative (cell early apoptosis) rate
increased from 1% to 16% (Figure 2D), cell apoptosis
and death (Annexin V positive) rate increased from 7%
to 29% at 48 h (Figure 2E). To evaluate the molecular
basis underlying cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis, we
investigated the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis
regulatory proteins. As shown in Figure 2C, after 48 h
treatment, 1 mM 2-DG induced the expression of CDK
inhibitors p27and reduced Cyclin A and Cyclin D1 levels.
Figure 2F showed that, after 48 h treatment of 1 mM
2-DG, Bim and Bax increased clearly, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1
decreased dominantly and poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) was cleaved, which indicated that 2-DG induced
apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.

The glycolytic phenotype dose not correlate with
the sensitivity to 2-DG in ALL
2-DG is a most frequently used glycolytic inhibitor
that induces growth arrest and cell death by inhibiting
the activity of the key glycolytic enzyme hexokinase
(HK) and phosphoglucoisomerase [16–18]. HKII, a key
enzyme involved in catalyzing the first committed step of
glucose metabolism, has been recognized as an oncogenic
kinase, as it is over-expressed in many cancers and
contribute to tumor initiation progression, and resistance

to therapy [24–26]. In our study, we found that all tested
cells over-expressed HKII. However, there was no
obvious different in the expression of HKII in different
cell lines except Nalm-6 (Figure 5A). To determine the
glycolytic phenotype of those cells, we tested the glucose
consumption and lactate production, and then calculated
the ratio of lactate production to glucose consumption.
The increase in the ratio of lactate production to glucose

consumption in the presence of oxygen showed the
increase in aerobic glycolysis in ALL cells. According to
Figure 5B, Figure 1B, and Figure 3B, the sensitivity to
2-DG alone or in combination with Dex was not consistent
to the glycolytic phenotype in ALL and Raji cells. That
is to say, the expression of HKII and the glycolytic
phenotype did not affect the cytotoxic effect of 2-DG
under normoxic condition in ALL cells.

Mannose rescues 2-DG-induced cell viability
inhibition and GC sensitization

2-DG (0~2 mM), cell viability decreased from 100% to
46% or 52% in CEM-C7-14 and CEM-C1-15 respectively,
mannose restored the cell viability to higher than 80%
(Figure 6B and 6C). The cell apoptosis and death induced
by 2-DG was mostly rescued by mannose (Figure 6D).
Therefore, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation was shown
to be the main mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by
2-DG under normoxic condition in ALL cells. In combined
group, mannose restored the cell viability to the baseline
level (Dex used alone) in GC sensitive cell lines Nalm-6
and CEM-C7-14, and GC resistant cell line CEM-C1-15
after 48 h treatment (Figure 6A–6C). In Raji and Molt4 cells, mannose partly inhibited the synergistic effect
induced by 2-DG and Dex (Figure 6A). Similarly, the
cell apoptosis and death was fully rescued to the baseline

2-DG has a dual activity of inhibiting glycolysis and
N-linked glycosylation [27]. Increasing evidence indicates
that interfering with N-linked glycosylation is the key
mechanism in eliciting tumor cell death under normoxia
[28–30]. To further explore the molecular mechanism,
we co-treated cells with mannose to rescued N-linked
glycosylation. 2 mM mannose did not affect the cell
proliferation or viability (data not shown) under normoxia.
Figure 6A showed that mannose rescued the cells viability
from 29% to 83% in the most effective cell line Nalm-6,
and 77% to 82% in Raji cells after 48 h treatment when
2-DG used alone. Along with the increasing dosage of

level by mannose in CEM-C1-15 and CEM-C7-14 cells
(Figure 6D). In Molt-4 cells, consistent to the effect on
cell viability, mannose rescued the cells from death partly.
These findings implicated N-linked glycosylation inhibition
as a main mechanism for GC resensitization by 2-DG.

(Thr421/Ser424) obviously (Figure 7A and 7B). On the
contrary to p-p70S6K, GRP78 was induced dominantly
(Figure 7A and 7B). After 48 h treatment, cell apoptosis
was triggered by 2-DG, which was detected by cleaved
PARP and cleaved caspase-3. Mannose completely
restored the expression of GRP78, p-p70S6K, PARP and
caspase-3. These data indicated that induction of ER stress
led to 2-DG induced cell death.
Different to 2-DG treatment alone, combined with
Dex inhibited HKII expression at 24 h, recovered a part
at 48 h (Figure 7A and 7B). Notably, combined treatment
decreased AMPKα1 dominantly with significantly
inducing of AMPKα2 after 48 h treatment. And the
expression of p-AMPKα1(Thr172) was induced after 24 h,
both p-AMPKα1 (Thr172) and p-AMPKα2 (Thr172) were
induced dominantly after 48 h (Figure 7A and 7B). AMPK
has been proposed as a physiological cellular energy sensor
[31]. The induction of p-AMPKα (Thr172) indicates
combined treatment led to a decrease in intracellular
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. Moreover,
mannose did not fully rescue the expression of p-AMPKα
(Thr172) to the baseline level (Dex used alone) (Figure 7A
and 7B). That means the energy inhibited by combined
treatment would not be fully rescued by mannose.

Induction of ER stress leads to 2-DG induced cell
death and GC sensitization
Under normoxia, 2-DG induces cell death by
interfering with N-linked glycosylation, which leads to
accumulation of misfolded proteins and an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress response [28]. To further explore the
molecular mechanisms by which 2-DG induces cell death
and GC sensitivity in ALL, we examined the expression of
HKII and critical signaling proteins associated with energy
metabolism in general (AMP-activated protein kinase,
AMPKα and p-AMPKα), ER stress marker (glucoseregulated protein 78, GRP78), p70S6 kinase (p70S6K),
p- p70S6K and cell apoptosis in Molt-4 cells. As shown in
Figure 7, after 48 h treatment, 1 mM 2-DG did not inhibit
the expression of HKII. Meanwhile, p-AMPK (Thr172)
was not induced. Interestingly, after 24 h treatment, 2-DG
decreased the expression of p70S6K and p-p70S6K

DISCUSSION

Similar to 2-DG treatment alone, GRP78 was induced
by combined treatment and fully restored by mannose.
The expression of p70S6K and p-p70S6K (Thr421/
Ser424) decreased obviously. These proteins were almost
fully restored by mannose. Combined treatment cleaved
PARP and caspase-3 clearly at 48 h, mannose restored
the expression of these proteins partly (Figure 7A). That
means, in 2-DG sensitive cell line, inhibition of glycolysis
may help to overcome GC resistance under normoxia.
Taken together, these data suggest that induction of ER
stress is the predominant mechanism responsible for 2-DG
to overcome GC resistance.

Although remarkable progress has been made in
the treatment of ALL in the past two decades, with the
proportion of patients surviving for 5 years approaching
and even exceeding 90% in many developed countries
[32], still 15~20% of the children relapse with an acquired
chemoresistance, and more and more patients are
suffering treatment-related late effects [3, 5, 6]. Further
improvement in the treatment outcome and quality of life
will require novel and optimizing treatment to maximize
the effect of killing leukemia cells and minimize the

toxicity of traditional chemotherapy. The novel drugs are
needed to target cancer cells, sensitize chemotherapy and
reverse chemoresistance.
In our previous study, we found that inhibition of
p70S6K/glycolysis signaling pathway plays an essential
role in reversing GC resistance in Burkitt lymphoma
Raji cells [19]. Emerging evidence indicates that cancer
is primarily a metabolic disease involving disturbances
in energy production [33]. The metabolic shift towards
aerobic glycolysis with reprogramming of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation, regardless of oxygen
availability, is a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect
[10].This alternative energy metabolism strategy used by
tumor cells makes it a potential targetable pathway for
cancer diagnosis and therapy. One of the most frequently
used antiglycolytic agents is 2-DG, a non-metabolizable
sugar analog, which is selectively taken up by cancer
cells, phosphorylated by HK and subsequently inhibits
ATP generated via the glycolytic pathway [16]. Our study
showed 2-DG inhibited glucose uptake and reversed GC

resistance in Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells [19]. Therefore,
2-DG might be the potent drug we are looking for.
Recently, it has been shown that like those solid tumor
cells, leukemia cells also exhibit increased glycolytic rate
even in the presense of sufficient oxgen [34].
As expected, 2-DG inhibited the growth of ALL cells
under normoxic conditions in a dose and time dependent
manner by inducing cell death and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.
It is worthy to note that, T-ALL cells were sensitive to
2-DG just like B-ALL. Moreover, the tested T-ALL cell
lines, CEM-C7-14, CEM-C1-15, Jurkat, Molt-4, were all
established from T-ALL patients at relapse. T-ALL patients
often have high-risk clinical features such as older patient
age, high leukocyte count, or other indications of high
tumor burden, and central nervous system involvement is
not uncommon [35]. Therefore, patients with T-ALL have
a poorer prognosis than patients with B-ALL. Nowadays,
intensified chemotherapy protocols have increased the
cure rate to approximately 75% in pediatric patients [36].
Nevertheless, patients with T-ALL remain at increased

risk for remission induction failure, early relapse, isolated
CNS relapse and late effects caused by the high-dose
chemotherapy [35, 36]. Our results indicated that 2-DG
is a potent drug to induce cell death of T-ALL cells and
might help to improve the prognosis for T-ALL patients.
Under hypoxic conditions where glycolysis is
the only source of energy, 2-DG severely depletes ATP
eventually leading to massive cell death [16, 17]. In most
tumor cell lines, 2-DG always induces cell death under
hypoxia conditions and it is toxic only in select tumor
cell lines growing under normoxic conditions [17, 18].
However, under nomoxia, high concentrations (~20 mM)
of 2-DG were typically used to inhibit the glycolytic
metabolism in cancer cells [37, 38]. Therefore, its efficacy
is limited by the systemic toxicity [37, 39]. In our study,
0.4  mM 2-DG, a quite low dosage, could induce cell
death in T-ALL Molt-4 cell line under normoxia. And
the IC 50 of all those tested cell lines is ranged from
0.22 to 2.27  mM. Notably, the sensitivity to 2-DG did
not correlate with the glycolytic phenotype. In Molt-4
cells, according to the expression of HKII, AMPK and
p-AMPK (Thr172), 1 mM 2-DG had almost no effect
on the energy metabolism after 48 h treatment. So, the
antileukemic efficiency of 2-DG on ALL cells cannot
be explained by glycolytic inhibition. 2-DG kills select
tumor cells under normoxic conditions through inhibiting
N-linked glycosylation and inducing ER stress mediated
apoptosis [28–30]. In our study, 2-DG alone induced the
expression of GRP78 clearly. GRP78, a predominant
ER chaperone, promotes cell proliferation, survival
and metastasis. ER stress induces GRP78 expression
and promotes an interaction between GRP78 and AKT,
which in turn suppresses Ser473 phosphorylation of
AKT and thereby modulates substrate, including AKT/
mTOR/p70S6K pathway, specificity [40]. As expected,
low-dose 2-DG decreased the expression of p70S6K and
p-p70S6K (Thr421/Ser424) obviously with the increase
of GRP78. Therefore, mannose, a sugar essential for
N-linked glycosylation, was added to 2-DG-treated cells
to inhibit ER stress. In our study, 2 mM mannose almost
fully restored the expression of all those proteins and cell
viability in ALL cells. Our results confirmed that lowdose 2-DG kills ALL cells through inhibiting N-linked
glycosylation and inducing ER stress mediated apoptosis.
GCs induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALL
cells and therefore constitute a central component in the
treatment of lymphoid malignancies. GC resistance is a
well recognized feature of poor prognosis in the treatment
of childhood ALL and several mechanisms have been
suggested [41]. Methods to overcome GC resistance are
still lacking in clinic. Targeting glycolysis pathway may
be a particular promising strategy to reverse GC resistance
in pediatric ALL [42, 43]. 2-DG increased the sensitivity
of NHL cells to methylprednisolone via down-regulation
of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and c-Myc [23].
Our results reconfirmed that, low dose of 2-DG (1 mM)

showed synergistic killing effects in T and B lineage
ALL cells. Similar to 2-DG treatment alone, combined
treatment increased GRP78 and cleaved PARP and
caspase-3 obviously by inducing ER stress. Moreover,
mannose fully rescued cell death and viability induced by
combined treatment in CEM-C1-15 and CEM-C7-14 cell
lines. Even in 2-DG sensitive Molt-4 cell line, mannose
could partly rescue the antileukemic effect induced by
combined treatment. That is to say, N-linked glycosylation
inhibition is the key mechanism for GC resensitization
by 2-DG rather than glycolysis inhibition. We know that
normal tissue toxicity is one of the major limiting factors
in cancer therapy. Farooque et al. reviewed studies of
2-DG in vitro, in vivo and in clinical trial, and concluded
that normal cells and tissues are spared or protected
against radiation or chemotherapy damage by 2-DG [44].
Moreover, clinical trials showed that 2-DG is safe to use
at 250 mg/kg body weight (~1.5 mM) given weekly for
7 weeks [45]. Thus, 1 mM 2-DG can be used safely in
ALL patients in clinic.
Taken together, our study highlights the potential
of 2-DG as a low-toxic drug to selectively kill ALL
cells and overcome GC resistance. Inhibition of the
N-linked glycosylation and induction of ER stress plays
an essential role in inducing cell death and reversing GC
resistance in ALL cells, which provides new insight into
the molecular mechanisms involved in GC resistance.
Addition of 2-DG or its analog to the current treatment
protocol for ALL patients may predict an even better long
time survival and cure rate especially for those refractory
and relapsed patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
T-ALL cell lines, Molt-4 (GC resistance) and Jurkat
(GC resistance) were kindly provided by Dr. Morris (St.
Jude children’s Research Hospital); CEM-C1-15 (GC
resistance) and CEM-C7-14(GC sensitive) were isolated
from a patient with ALL [46] and kindly provided by Dr.
Thompson (The University of Texas Medical Branch).
B-ALL cell line, Nalm-6 (GC sensitive), RS4:11 (GC
sensitive) and Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji (B-lineage,
GC resistance) were purchased from Shanghai Institute
Cell Resources Bank. All cell lines were maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2 in-air atmosphere.

Reagents and antibodies
2-DG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used at the
concentration of 0~10 mM. Dex (Sigma) was dissolved in
30987

Oncotarget

Cell cycle analysis

ethanol and used at the concentration of 1 µM, the final
concentration of ethanol in the medium was 0.01%, at which
cell growth was not obviously altered. Mannose (sigma)
were dissolved in PBS and used at the concentration of 2
mM, at which cell growth was not obviously affected. PI
and MTT were purchased from Sigma. The Annexin V-PI
Kit was purchased from Roche (Mannheim, Germany).
Antibodies to HKII, p70S6K, p-p70S6K (Thr421/
Ser424), AMPK, p-AMPK (Thr172), GRP78, Cyclin D1,
p27, PARP, Caspase-3, Bax, Mcl-1, Bim and Bcl-2 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA,
USA). The antibody for p21 was purchased from BD
Bioscience (San Jose, CA, USA). Antibodies to Cyclin A,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated donkey antirabbit antibody and HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse
antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). The β-Actin antibody was obtained from
Kangchen Bio-Tech (Shanghai, China).

For each analysis, 106 cells were harvested 48 h
after treatment and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at
4°C. Cells were then washed and stained with 5 μg/ml
PI in the presence of DNAse-free RNAse (Sigma). After
30 min at room temperature, the cells were analyzed via
flow cytometry (Cytomics FC 500 and CXP & Multicycle
software, Beckman Coulter Inc., Miami, FL, USA),
acquiring 30,000 events.

Apoptosis assay
The samples were washed with PBS twice and
stained with Annexin V-FLUOS and PI using AnnexinV-FLUOS staining kit (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The percentage of Annexin-V
positive and PI negative cells was determined by flow
cytometry (Cytomics FC 500 and CXP software, Beckman
Coulter), as the percentage of cells in the early stage of
apoptosis, the percentage of Annexin-Vpositive and PI
positive was recorded as the percentage of late apoptosis
and necrosis. The percentage of Annexin-Vpositive was
recorded as the percentage of cell apoptosis and death.

Cell treatment
Logarithmically growing cells were harvested
and replaced in 96-well sterile plastic culture plates
and 25 cm2 flasks (Corning Inc.), to which various
concentrations of 2-DG or 1 µM Dex, specifically 1 mM
2-DG (2-DG group), 1 µM Dex (Dex group), 1 mM 2-DG
plus 1 µM Dex (2-DG+Dex group) and 0.01% ethanol
(Control group), were added respectively. At the end of
the incubation period, cells were transferred to sterile
centrifuge tubes, pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g at
room temperature for 5 min, and prepared for analysis as
described below.

Glucose consumption assay
Glucose consumption was measured with a Glucose
(HK) Assay Kit (Sigma). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were grown
in 10 ml RPMI containing 2 g/L glucose. After 48 h, the
medium was collected by centrifugation to remove the
cells. Medium from each condition was incubated for
30 min with the glucose assay reagent. Spectrophotometric
absorbance was measured at 340 nm using a multi-plate
reader (Multiskan Spectrum). Values were obtained by
comparing with a glucose standard solution.

Cell viability assay
MTT assays were performed as described previously
[19]. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (200,000/ml)
and incubated for 24 or 48 h. Next, 0.5 mM MTT (final
concentration) was added to each well for 4 h at 37°C.
Then, solubilization buffer (10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl) was
added to each well, and the plates were further incubated
for 24 h at 37°C. The spectrophotometric absorbance was
measured at 570 nm (reference 690 nm) using a multiplate reader (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo Electron Co.,
Waltham, MA, USA). Values were obtained by comparing
the experimental cells with their respective controls. Mean
values were calculated from triplicate cultures. The CDI
was used to analyze the effects of drug combinations. The
CDI is calculated as follows: CDI = AB/(A × B). According
to the absorbance of each group, AB is the ratio of the
combination groups to control group; A or B is the ratio
of the single agent group to control group. Thus, a CDI
value < 1, = 1 or > 1 indicates that the drugs are synergistic,
additive or antagonistic, respectively. CDI < 0.75 indicates
that the drugs are significantly synergistic.

Lactate concentration assay
The concentration of lactate, the final metabolic
product of the glycolytic pathway, was analyzed using a
Lactate Assay Kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China). Briefly,
2 × 106 cells were grown in 10 ml RPMI containing
2  g/L glucose. After 48 h, the medium was collected by
centrifugation to remove the cells. Latate in the supernatant
was detected according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Spectrophotometric absorbance was measured at 530 nm
using a multi-plate reader (Multiskan Spectrum). Values
were obtained by comparing with a lactate standard solution.

Western blotting analysis
Western blotting analysis was performed as
described previously [19]. Briefly, cells (106) were washed
twice in cold PBS and then lysed by Laemmli sample

buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were boiled for 5 min at 100°C.
Proteins were separated by 8%~15% SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes (0.22 μm or 0.45 μm, Millipore). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat
dry milk dissolved in TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,
137 mM NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 2 h at
room temperature, followed by incubation with primary
antibody for 2 h at room temperature or at 4°C overnight.
The membranes were then washed 3 times in TTBS and
incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary
HRP–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody or HRPconjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:5000 in
TTBS with 5% non-fat milk. Proteins were visualized by
incubation with ECL plus (Millipore). All experiments
were carried out independently at least 3 times. The level
of β-Actin protein was used as a control for the amount of
protein loaded into each lane.
