ABSTRACT
Drug resistance remains an obstacle hindering the success of chemotherapy.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been recently found to confer resistance to
chemotherapy. Therefore functional markers of CSCs should be discovered and specific
therapies targeting these cells should be developed. In our investigation, a small
population of B16F10 cells which was positive for ATP-binding cassette sub-family B
member 5 (ABCB5) was isolated. This population displayed characteristics similar to
those of CSCs and ABCB5 was identified to confer tumor growth and drug resistance
in B16F10 cell line. Although targeting ABCB5 by small short interfering RNA delivered
by VNP20009 failed to inhibit tumor growth, the combined treatment of VNP-shABCB5
and chemotherapy can act synergistically to delay tumor growth and enhance survival
time in a primary B16F10 mice model. Results suggest that the combined treatment
of VNP-shABCB5 and chemotherapy can improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
drugs. Therefore, this combination therapy is of potential significance for melanoma
treatment.

Increasing evidence has shown that a small proportion
of cells in melanoma may contribute to therapy resistance [5,
6]. In contrast to other tumor cells, these cells which contain
clonal long-term repopulation and self-renewal capacity are
known as cancer stem cells (CSCs) and at the apex of tumor
hierarchy [7–9]. Moreover CSCs have been frequently
reported to correlate with neoplastic progression, metastatic
potential and poor prognosis in melanoma patients [10–
12]. CSCs are thought to be resistant to chemotherapy
because of various reasons such as their quiescent or
slowly proliferating nature, high expression level of ATPbinding cassette (Abc) drug pumps, intrinsically high
levels of anti-apoptotic molecules, relative resistance to
oxidative or DNA damage, and efficiency of DNA repair
[13]. In particular, ATP-binding cassette sub-family B
member 5 (ABCB5), the mediator of chemoresistance,
is overexpressed by CSCs in diverse human malignancies,

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is one of the world’s most aggressive
skin cancer and has become more common nowadays [1].
When melanoma becomes metastatic, it acquires resistance
to chemotherapy and tends to disseminate to other organs
[2]. At this stage, metastatic melanoma is notorious for its
poor prognosis with an average survival time of seven to
nine months [3]. Aside from chemotherapeutic drugs such
as nitrosoureas, taxanes, vinca alkaloids and platinumassociated drugs, which failed in large random studies,
the current chemotherapeutic drugs that theoretically
target all metastatic sites, including dacarbazine (DTIC),
cyclophosphamide (CTX) and temozolomide, did not
significantly increase the overall survival rate of melanoma
patients [2, 4]. Therefore, resistance to chemotherapy is a
major obstacle in treating metastatic melanoma.

including melanoma stem cells. ABCB5 has also been
identified as a CSC marker in human melanoma [10, 12,
14–18]. The expression of ABCB5 strongly overlapped
with clinical tumor progression, therapeutic resistance,
and recurrence in malignant melanoma [3, 10, 17, 19–23].
Furthermore, ABCB5 is frequently correlated with the in
vitro clonogenic potential of melanoma cells [24–26].
Previous research also reported that blocking ABCB5 can
inhibit tumor growth and reverse the resistance of CSCs
to chemotherapeutic agents [10, 27]. Therefore, identifying
and targeting CSCs can significantly improve cancer
therapies.
In this study, we treated tumor-bearing mice with the
engineered VNP20009, which is a variant of Salmonella
and has been proven safe in phase I clinical trial,
together with CTX. We found this combined treatment
of VNP20009 carrying shABCB5 with CTX efficiently
reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival time by
reducing ABCB5 expression and inhibiting chemotherapy
resistance.

initiation frequency. The tumorigenic cell frequency
for the ABCB5-positive was 1/4591 (1/1900–1/10993),
whereas that for the ABCB5-negative population was
1/28004 (1/7039-1/111406) (Figure 1C).
To further prove the potential of ABCB5 as a CSC
marker in murine melanoma cells, we sorted B16F10
(CD44+CD133+CD24+) by FACSAria™ III which have
been proved to have biological characteristics of CSC.
We then analyzed the expression of ABCB5 in B16F10
(CD44+CD133+CD24+) and B16F10 (CD44-CD133CD24-). Western blot analysis showed a higher expression
of ABCB5 in B16F10 (CD44+CD133+CD24+), with
characteristics of CSCs, than in B16F10 (CD44-CD133CD24-) (Figure 1D). Overall, these data suggest ABCB5
as a CSC marker of murine melanoma.

ABCB5 regulates murine melanoma growth and
multidrug resistance
To elucidate the functional role of ABCB5 in
murine melanoma growth, we silenced ABCB5 in
B16F10 by shRNA. Western blot and qPCR analyses
confirmed that shABCB5 can silence the level of
ABCB5 (Figure 2A, 2B). Afterward, we inoculated
10,000 cells of B16F10 (shABCB5) or respective
control into the mid-right flank of C57B6 mice. Tumor
formation and volume were recorded every other day.
Tumor growth upon ABCB5 inhibition was severely
impaired throughout the course of the experiment.
The tumor volumes of mice inoculated with B16F10
(shABCB5) significantly decreased compared with
the respective controls, demonstrating that ABCB5
performs a functional role in murine melanoma growth
(Figure 2C).
B16F10 (shABCB5) and its respective control
were treated with varying concentrations of paclitaxel
or doxorubicin at indicated times to analyze the
functional role of ABCB5 in multidrug resistance by
MTT. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin have been reported
to be closely related to drug resistance and ABCB5
expression in melanoma. MTT assay showed that the
viability of B16F10 (shABCB5) decreased to 71%, 56%,
54%, 31% and 24% after treatment with 1, 5, 25 and
50 μM paclitaxel respectively, whereas the viability of
the control group was 85%, 81%, 80% 53% and 38%
correspondingly (Figure 2D). The viability of B16F10
(shABCB5) treated with doxorubicin also significantly
decreased (73% vs. 82% for 0.25 μM, 58% vs. 69%
for 0.5 μM and 41% vs. 59% for 1 μM) (Figure 2D).
Thus inhibition of ABCB5 can reverse the resistance of
B16F10 melanoma cells to paclitaxel and doxorubicin.
These results demonstrated two functional roles of
ABCB5 in murine melanoma growth and multidrug
resistance, suggesting that ABCB5 is a promising target
for melanoma therapy.

RESULTS
Identification of potential CSC surface markers
of murine melanoma cells
To enrich CSCs, B16F10 cells were subcutaneously
(s.c.) inoculated into the mid-right flank of C57/B6 mice.
When the tumor size reached 500 mm3, the mice were
sacrificed. As mentioned in the Materials and methods, the
treated tumor cells were re-inoculated into the C57/B6 mice.
After three rounds of selection, we probed the cells using
antibodies against potential CSC markers, including CD144,
CD133 and ABCB5 [28]. Although no cells expressed CD144,
a subpopulation of the cells expressing CD133 (32.9%)
or ABCB5 (6.05%) was detected (Figure 1A). We then
investigated the tumorigenicity of the cells expressing CD133
or ABCB5. After three rounds of selection, we stained the cells
using antibody against CD133 or ABCB5. CD133-positive,
CD133-negative, ABCB5-positive and ABCB5-negative
cells were sorted by FACSAria™ III. Protein expression of
the individual population was confirmed by real-time PCR,
which showed that the positive groups expressed higher levels
of CD133 or ABCB5 than the negative groups (Figure 1B).
A rigorous and functional test for CSCs is the
limiting dilution assay. Accordingly, CD133 positive or
negative cells were injected into the mice, but we did not
observe any differences with respect to tumorigenicity.
The tumorigenic cell frequency for the CD133-positive
population was 1/18399 (1/5709-1/59298), whereas that
for the CD133-negative population was 1/28004 (1/70391/111406) (Figure 1C). No significant difference was
detected between the two groups of tumorigenic cell
frequency. However, cells from the ABCB5-negative
population exhibited a six fold reduction of tumor-

markedly enhanced the anticancer ability, the combined
therapy of VNP-shABCB5 and CTX further attenuated
tumor growth and prolonged the survival time compared
with the other groups (Figure 4). The tumor volume in
VNP-shABCB5 plus CTX group significantly decreased
compared with the other groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4A).
Kaplan Meier survival assay showed that the survival rate
of mice in the VNP-shABCB5 plus CTX group significantly
increased compared with those in the PBS, CTX and VNPscrambled plus CTX groups (log-rank tests, P<0.05) (Figure
4B). The tumor doubling time was significantly prolonged
from 1.49 d (CI, 1.42 d to 1.56 d) in the PBS control
group, 4.89 d (CI, 4.55 d to 5.28 d) in the CTX group, or
6.68 d (CI, 6.15 d to 7.30 d) in the VNP-scrambled plus
CTX group to 8.94 d (CI, 10.13 d to 7.99 d) in the VNPshABCB5 plus CTX group (P<0.05) (Figure 4C).
To determine whether the synergistic effect of
VNP-shABCB5 and CTX on tumor growth was caused
by moderating the chemotherapy resistance, we stained
the tumor sections with Ki-67 antibody for CTX, which
acted by interfering DNA replication and inhibiting tumor
growth. Immunochemical analysis of the tumor with Ki-67
antibody revealed that although CTX treatment alone could
attenuate Ki-67 expression, the percentage of Ki-67 positive
staining significantly decreased in the combined therapy of
CTX with VNP-shABCB5 (Figure 5A, 5B). In addition, we
stained the tumor sections with an in situ TUNEL assay. As
shown in Figure 5C and 5D, TUNEL-positive staining was
observed in nearly half the area of the section, indicating
that more cell death occurred due to the combined therapy.
Consistent with previous reports, the combined therapy of
VNP-scrambled and CTX can also promote cell death to a
lesser extent. CTX alone also showed a significantly less
effective induction of death in melanoma cells in vivo than
the combined therapy of either VNP-shABCB5 plus CTX
or VNP-scrambled vector plus CTX.

Considering that ABCB5 is an attractive therapeutic
target, we tend to silence the expression of ABCB5 carried
by VNP20009, which has been reported to specifically target
CSC-like population and reduce its growth [29, 30]. After
generating VNP20009 carrying shABCB5, we monitored
whether systemic delivery of Salmonella can effectively
silence the expression of ABCB5 in vivo. Tumor-bearing
mice were randomly divided into three groups and
treated with PBS, VNP-scrambled and VNP-shABCB5,
respectively. As shown in Figure 3B and 3C, there was no
significant attenuation of tumor growth in the mice treated
with VNP-shABCB5 compared with VNP-scrambled and
the survival time of the mice between the two groups was
not significantly different. All the mice were sacrificed and
each tumor was homogenized. Total RNA was isolated
for RT-PCR. Our results showed that the expression of
ABCB5 significantly decreased in the mice treated with
VNP-shABCB5 five days post injection (Figure 3A). Taken
together, these findings confirmed that VNP-shABCB5
succeeded in silencing ABCB5 mRNA but failed to improve
the anticancer ability compared with VNP-scrambled.

Combined therapy of VNP-shABCB5 and CTX
suppress tumor growth
Given that ABCB5 mediated drug resistance in
B16F10, we delivered VNP-shABCB5 together with CTX
to moderate drug resistance in chemotherapy. When the
tumor was palpable, 40 mg/kg CTX was administrated i.p.
every other day, as described in Jia’s work [31]. 1×105 CFU
of VNP-shABCB5 or VNP-scrambled was simultaneously
administered at the beginning of CTX treatment. Although

DISCUSSION

melanoma aggressiveness, but more work need to be done
to elucidate the mechanism.
Considering that ABCB5 is a promising target
for melanoma therapy, we selected VNP20009 carrying
shRNA against ABCB5 to inhibit the melanoma growth
in mice. VNP20009 was developed by depleting msbB
and pur I in the background Salmonella 14028 and has
been proven safe in the phase I clinical trial [38, 39]. Since
VNP20009 preferentially accumulates in tumor at a ratio
greater than 1000/1 compared with normal organs, it is
widely used as a delivery vehicle expressing exogenous
proteins such as TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL), Histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG),
or carrying shRNA-expressing plasmid to silence
the expression of genes like STAT3 and indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [40–43]. Recent evidence showed
that Salmonella can predominantly reside in the CSC
region of tumor and is a promising therapy for chemoresistant pancreatic cancer stem-like cells [29, 30]. In our
study when the tumor was palpable, VNP20009 carrying
shABCB5 was administered into the tumor-bearing mice
and its anticancer capacity was recorded. Our results
showed that the expression of ABCB5 was decreased in
the tumor of mice treated with VNP-shABCB5, which
indicated that VNP-mediated shRNA could specifically
target ABCB5 and silence its expression. Although both
VNP-scrambled and VNP-shABCB5 effectively inhibited
tumor growth, there was no significant difference between
the tumor volumes of the mice treated with VNPscrambled and VNP-shABCB5. This was not surprising.
In contrast to published reports, in which ABCB5 has been
silenced on the day of tumor implantation, we began the
treatment when the tumor was already palpable. Given
that tumor contain not only tumor-initiating cells but also
proliferating progenitor-like cells, all cancer cells that
may potentially contribute to the disease should be killed.
Therefore, VNP-shABCB5 should be combined with
chemotherapeutic drugs.

Chemotherapy resistance is a major factor impairing
melanoma treatment. Because of intratumoral heterogeneity,
chemotherapy only kills cells that are sensitive to drugs and
leaves the drug-resistant cells unharmed. Indeed, mounting
evidence has shown that CSCs play an important role in
chemotherapy resistance [32, 33].
The present study aimed to design a novel therapy
targeting CSCs in B16F10 cells to improve the efficacy
of chemotherapy. Both CD133 and ABCB5 have been
identified as CSC markers of human melanoma. CD133positive cells have been reported to display multipotent differentiation in vitro and tumorigenic growth
in vivo [34]. CD133 down-regulation in melanoma cells
has led to the decrease in proliferation rate, cellular
migration and inhibition of melanosphere formation; such
findings confirmed a key role for CD133 in melanoma
tumor formation [35, 36]. However in the present study
we did not observe any difference in tumor initiation
capacity when comparing CD133+ with CD133- groups,
suggesting that CD133 alone cannot identify CSCs in
B16F10. These findings are consistent with Jun Dou’s
work. However, ABCB5-positive cells exhibited higher
tumorigenicity in C57/B6 mice than cells not expressing
the protein. More importantly, a higher expression of
ABCB5 was found in B16F10 (CD44+CD133+CD24+),
which have characteristics of CSC, than in B16F10
(CD44-CD133-CD24-) [37]. Furthermore inhibition of
ABCB5 can impair tumor growth in vivo and reverse the
resistance of B16F10 melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs in vitro. Although ABCB5 has been extensively
studied in diverse human malignancies, few investigated
ABCB5 in murine melanoma. Our results provide initial
evidence that ABCB5 is not only a marker of murine
melanoma CSCs, but also perform functional roles in
murine melanoma growth and multidrug resistance. This
implicates that ABCB5 serves as a key driver of murine

Our results were promising. The combined therapy
of VNP-shABCB5 and CTX significantly reduced tumor
growth and prolonged the survival time compared with those
of the VNP-scrambled plus CTX, CTX, and PBS groups. The
combined therapy significantly induced tumor cell apoptosis
and inhibited its proliferation. VNP-scrambled could also
improve the anticancer ability of CTX, which was consistent
with Jia’s work [31]. Two mechanisms may contribute to the
synergistic antitumor effects of CTX and VNP-shABCB5.

First, ABCB5 blockage mediated by VNP20009 may render
cells more sensitive to chemotherapy agents, therefore CTX
kills CSCs as well as other tumor cells. Secondly, Salmonella
can play a direct role in the CSC population and inhibit CSCs
growth in vivo. This may further explain Jia’s work in which
VNP20009 improved cyclophosphamide chemotherapy at
maximum tolerated dose and low-dose metronomic regimens
in a murine melanoma model by targeting and killing CSCs
in B16F10 melanoma cells.

In summary, we found a potential CSC marker
of B16F10 melanoma and designed an approach of
combining VNP20009 carrying shRNA targeting against
CSC marker with chemotherapy. The combined therapy
can inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival time by
moderating chemotherapy resistance. We believe that
this strategy opens new windows in melanoma treatment
and potentiates future researches and applications of
combinatorial therapies.

and B16F10 (shABCB5) were treated with various
concentrations of paclitaxel or doxorubicin for 24
hours. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay as
described previously [45]. In brief, after drug treatment,
MTT (5 mg/ml, 100 μl/well) was added to each well and
after additional 4 hours incubation, the supernatant was
removed and 100 μl/well DMSO was added. After shaking
the plates for 10 min to dissolve the formazan, absorbance
of each well was recorded with a microplate reader (Safire,
TECAN, Switzerland) at 570 nm.

Real time quantitative PCR assay

Bacteria, cell lines and animals

Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). cDNA was generalized using ReverTra Ace®
qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo). Real-time quantitative PCR was
done with primers as follows to determine the expression
level of CD133 and ABCB5.

Lipid A modified (msbB−), auxotrophic (purI−)
Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) and
cultured in modified Luria–Bertani (LB) media. The
B16F10 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured
in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Six-week-old female C57/B6 mice were
purchased from the Comparative Medicine Center of
Yangzhou University and maintained in pathogen-free
conditions for one week before the start of the experiment.

Flow cytometry
Before sorting, B16F10 cells were suspended in
ice-cold PBS to a final density of 106/ml and injected into
mid right flank of C57/B6 mice with 100 μl. When tumor
grew up, the mice with tumor were then sacrificed, and the
isolated cells from the tumor tissue were cultured. These
cells were re-inoculated into C57B6 mice after in vitro
culture. After three times of the repeated inoculation
approach, the cells were stained with antibody against
CD144 (FITC-), CD133 (APC-), ABCB5 (FITC-) at 4°C
for 30 min. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur
using CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences).

Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on
StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
USA) with AceQ® qPCR SYBR® Green Master Mix
(Vazyme China). Data was analyzed by StepOne
Software 2.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s specifications. β-actin was used as a
control.

shRNA plasmid construction and bacterial
transformation
shRNA against ABCB5 was tested for silencing by
transformation of B16F10 cells followed by RT-PCR. The
pRNA U6.1 vector containing the 19-mer shRNA sense
sequence GGTCGATGAACAAATGGAA silenced more
than 60% of ABCB5. The pRNA U6.1 vector and the
one containing the shRNA sequence were respectively
electroporated into VNP20009 by Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio
Rad) at 2.5 kV, 25 mF and 400Ω.

Limiting dilution transplantation assay
For limiting dilution assay, 100, 1000, 10,000
cells of the individual subpopulation (CD133+, CD133-,
ABCB5+ and ABCB5-), which was generated using
anti-CD133 and anti-ABCB5 antibody labeling and
sorted by FACSAria™ III, were subcutaneously
transplanted into mid-right flank of C57/B6 mice. Tumor
development was then monitored on a daily basis. Tumorinitiation frequency (TIF) was calculated by the ELDA
Software [44].

Tumor implantation, CTX and bacterial treatment
1×105 B16F10 cells were subcutaneously (s.c.)

Five days after treatment, mice in the PBS, VNPscrambled & CTX, VNP-shABCB5 & CTX group were
sacrificed. After freezing in isopentane pre-cooled with
liquid nitrogen, the OCT-embedded tumor was cut into 10
μm sections. The tumor frozen sections were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal antibody against Ki67 to analyze
the expression of Ki67. Apoptotic cells in situ were
determined by TUNEL Bright Red Apoptosis Detection
Kit (Vazyme).
