ABSTRACT
Gefitinib is a first line anti-tumor drug used for the treatment of patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations. However, the drug
resistance to gefitinib limits its clinical application. Here, we observed the CSCs of
PC9 are obviously resistant to gefitinib compared with the non-CSCs. Furthermore,
we found the gefitinib failed to suppress the PI3K/AKT pathway in the PC9-CSCs.
Mechanically, we showed significant down-regulation of miR-128 in the PC9-CSCs
compared with the non-CSCs. Overexpression of miR-128 significantly increased the
sensitivity of PC9-CSCs to gefitinib-induced apoptosis. In addition, the gene of c-met
was proved to be directly inhibited by miR-128. Enforced expression of c-met could
“rescue” the miR-128 promoted apoptosis and cleavage of caspases in PC9-CSCs
treated with gefitinib. Thus, these results indicate that the miR-128/c-met pathway
enhances the gefitinib sensitivity of the lung cancer stem cells by suppressing the
PI3K/AKT pathway.

INTRODUCTION

self-renewal [7–9]. Increasing evidence reveals that the
CD133+ populations of CSCs in NSCLC are responsible
for the high resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and
tumor relapse [10, 11]. Therefore, killing the should be
the strategy to treat the NSCLC more effectively.
Gefitinib, which is one of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),
is widely used for patients with NSCLC, especially the
ones harbor somatic mutations in the EGFR gene [12].
Although the gefitinib now is the first-line agent for
the treatment of lung cancer, the acquired resistance
to gefitinib becomes the Major obstacle after a period
of treatment [13]. PC9 cells which express the EGFR
exon 19 deletion mutation and are sensitive to gefitinib
treatment [14]. However, as the researches have proved
that the CSCs are involved in resistance to gefitinib in
NSCLC [15], it’s urgent to identify the mechanisms and
reverse the resistance of PC9-CSCs to gefitinib.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small, noncoding RNAs, which regulate the expression of targeted

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents
as the most common type of lung cancer and the leading
cause of cancer-related death around the world [1, 2].
The repeated use of anti-cancer drugs usually induces the
acquisition of resistance in NSCLC cells [3]. Recently,
studies have demonstrated that the existence of small
population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is an important
mechanism for chemoresistance [4].
CSCs own the multilineage differentiation
potential and the ability of self-renewal. As the CSCs can
differentiate and generate heterogeneous cell populations
to constitute the tumor, they are considered as the tumorinitiating cells [5]. CD133 is encoded by the prominin
1 (PROM1) gene in humans [6]. In several tumors
including lung cancer, CD133 has been considered as a
molecular marker to identify the CSCs, and the CD133
positive lung cancer cells are reported to exhibit the stemlike probabilities of tumorigenicity, proliferation, and

sensitivity of PC9-CSCs to gefitinib treatment
in vitro

genes by binding to the mRNAs at the 3’untranslated
region (3ʹ UTR) [16, 17]. Many studies have showed
that miRNAs function as regulators in a number of
basic biological processes, such as cell proliferation,
differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis. Therefore,
the miRNAs play important roles in cancer initiation
and development [18, 19]. Moreover, aberrantly
expression of miRNAs has also been reported to induce
drug-resistance in cancers, because the drug-resistance
related genes could be changed by the miRNAs
regulation [20]. In the present study, we found that the
miR-128 expression was decreased in PC9-CSCs. We
demonstrated that overexpression of miR-128 could
reverse the gefitinib resistance by inhibiting the PI3K/
AKT pathway.

To investigate the role of miR-128 in gefitinib
treatment in vitro, the expression of miR-128 between
PC9-CSCs and PC9-non-CSCs was compared by qRTPCR. The results of qRT-PCR revealed that the miR128 expression level was significantly decreased in the
CSCs compared with the non-CSCs in the PC9 cell line
(Figure 3A). To study the role of miR-128 in PC9CSCs, we transfected these cells with miR-128 mimics.
As shown in Figure 3B, transfection of miR-128
significantly increased the expression level of miR-128
in the PC9-CSCs as well as the corresponding nonCSCs. Interestingly, we found the treatment of gefitinib
significantly increased the population of CD133 positive
CSCs in PC9. By contrast, although the transfection of
miR-128 didn’t decrease the percentage of PC9-CSCs
population significantly, it inhibited the effect of gefitinib
on enriching the PC9-CSCs population (Figure 3C
and 3D). We explain that the CSCs could survive under the
gefitinib treatment, whereas the overexpression of miR128 increased the sensitivity of PC9-CSCs to gefitinib. To
confirm the effect of miR-128 on the gefitinib treatment to
PC9-CSCs, we next performed a cell viability assay. As
shown in Figure 3E, although the single treatment of miR128 didn’t show significant cytotoxicity, it significantly
sensitized the PC9-CSCs to gefitinib-induced cell death.
Taken together, these results prove that the overexpression
of miR-128 is able to increase the sensitivity of PC9-CSCs
to gefitinib treatment in vitro.

RESULTS
The lung cancer stem cells are resistant to
gefitinib compared with the non-CSCs
To study the gefitinib resistance in lung cancer,
we separated the CSCs and non-CSCs from the PC9 cell
line. The PC9-CSCs was isolated by using the CD133
antibody, and the efficiency of separation is shown in
Figure 1A, We observed that although the PC9-non-CSCs
are sensitivity to gefitinib-induced cell death, the PC9CSCs showed obvious resistance to gefitinib (Figure 1B).
Intuitively, the IC50 of gefitinib to PC9-CSCs is 9.29 fold
higher than the PC9-non-CSCs (Figure 1C). These results
indicate that the CSCs of lung cancer show resistance to
gefitinib.

Overexpression of miR-128 increases the
anti-tumor effect of gefitinib on NSCLC in vivo

PC9-CSCs are resistant to the gefitinib-induced
inactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway

To verify whether miR-128 promotes the antitumor effect of gefitinib on NSCLC in vivo, we inoculated
the nude mice with the PC9 cells transfected with LVmiR-128 or LV-control. The results revealed that miR-128
could promote the gefitinib to decrease the PC9 growth
in vivo (Figure 4A). In the tumor tissues originated
from the LV-miR-128 transfected PC9, we found
that the gefitinib treatment significantly inhibited the
phosphorylation of the entire EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway. However, in the tumor tissues originated from
the LV-control transfected PC9, although the activation
of EGFR was obviously suppressed, the phosphorylation
of PI3K and AKT was inhibited only slightly under the
treatment of gefitinib (Figure 4B). Furthermore, in the
LV-control transfected PC9 tumor tissues, the treatment
of gefitinib resulted in significant up-regulation of
PC9-CSCs population. On the contrary, overexpression of
miR-128 could inhibit the enrichment of CSCs population
due to the gefitinib therapy (Figure 4C and 4D). These

As the preceding results have shown that the PC9CSCs are resistant to gefitinib, we next investigate the role
of gefitinib in the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. As
shown in Figure 2A, we found that the entire EGFR/PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway was inhibited by the gefitinib
treatment in the PC9-non-CSCs. However, interestingly,
we observed that although the gefitinib treatment
significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, it
failed to suppress the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway
in the PC9-CSCs. Previous researches have demonstrated
that the apoptosis of cancer cells is inhibited by the
PI3K/AKT pathway [21, 22]. We therefore investigated
the effect of gefitinib on inducing the apoptosis in
the PC9 cells. In accordance with the results shown in
Figure 2A, we found that the gefitinib significantly
induced the apoptosis in the PC9-non-CSCs, whereas it
failed to trigger the apoptosis obviously in the PC9-CSCs
(Figure 2B).

due to the drug-resistance of lung cancer stem cells, and
the enforced expression of miR-128 is potential strategy
to increase the sensitivity of lung cancer stem cells to
gefitinib.

by all of these databases and owned a highly conserved
sequence in the 3ʹ UTR of the c-met mRNA that was
targeted by miR-128 (Figure 5A). To investigate the
potential negative correlation between miR-128 and c-met,
we evaluated the expression of c-met in the PC9-CSCs
and PC9-non-CSCs. As shown in Figure 5B, we observed
that the expression level of c-met was significantly higher
in the PC9-CSCs than that in the PC9-non-CSCs. We
then cloned the c-met 3ʹ-UTR sequences containing the
predicted target site of miR-128 into a luciferase reporter
vector. The results of luciferase reporter assays showed
that the luciferase activity in the group co-transfected
with miR-128 and pGL3-c-met reporter was significantly
lower than that in the group with miR-NC (Figure 5C),

To understand how miR-128 facilitates gefitinibinduced cell death in PC9-CSCs, the TargetScan,

the targets of miR-128. Of these target genes that were
predicted by these databases, the c-met gene is considered
as the possible target because it was commonly predicted

implying the effect of miR-128 on inhibiting the mRNA
of c-met gene. Furthermore, the results of western blot
analysis demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-128
could decrease the protein level of c-met in the PC9-CSCs
(Figure 5D). Taken together, we prove that the c-met gene
is a functional target of miR-128 in PC9-CSCs.

to “rescue” the miR-128 promoted cell death. We found
the transfection of c-met vector abolished the effect
of miR-128 on suppressing the expression of c-met
(Figure 6A). As expected, we observed that although
the miR-128 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of
gefitinib to PC9-CSCs, the enforced expression of c-met
by its recombinant plasmid abolished the promotion of
miR-128 on the gefitinib-induced cell death (Figure 6B).
Furthermore, transfection of c-met plasmid also abolished
the effect of miR-128 on inhibiting the gefitinib-induced
enrichment of CSCs population in PC9 cells (Figure 6C
and 6D). Taken together, these results indicate that the

miR-128 is able to increase the sensitivity of PC9-CSCs
to gefitinib by down-regulating the expression of c-met.

As the results of PI3K/AKT inhibition, we observed
that the overexpression of miR-128 significantly
promoted the gefitinib-induced apoptosis, meanwhile
the synergistic effects of miR-128 was abolished by the
c-met vector (Figure 7B). To investigate the apoptosis
pathway induced by the gefitinib and miR-128, the
caspases and mitochondria were studied. As we observed,
transfection of miR-128 significantly promoted the
activation of caspase-9, -7, -3 induced by gefitinib in
the PC9-CSCs (Figure 7C). Furthermore, we found the
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of PC9-CSCs
was significantly decreased due to the co-treatment with
gefitinib and miR-128 (Figure 7D). As the results of MMP
collapse, the ROS which is considered as a key apoptotic
inducer [25] was released from the mitochondria into the
cytoplasm (Figure 7E). In addition, enforced expression
of c-met obviously abolished the effect of the combination
with gefitinib and miR-128 on both the casspases and
mitochondria. Taken together, we demonstrate that the
miR-128/c-met axis inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT

MiR-128 enhanced the gefitinib-induced
apoptosis by suppressing the PI3K/Akt pathway
Previous studies have demonstrated that c-met
amplification leads to the resistance of EGFR-TKIs
by activating the downstream of PI3K⁄AKT signaling
pathway [23, 24]. We therefore investigated the role of
miR-128/c-met axis in the apoptosis pathway in the PC9CSCs treated with gefitinib. As shown in Figure 7A, single
treatment of gefitinib only inhibited the phosphorylation
of EGFR without influencing the activation of PI3K and
AKT obviously, whereas the combination with gefitinib
and miR-128 significantly suppressed the entire EGFR/
PI3K/AKT pathway. However, the overexpression of
c-met “recovered” the activation of PI3K/AKT even the
PC9-CSCs were co-treated with gefitinib and miR-128.

and the downstream of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
in the gefitinib-treated PC9-CSCs.

In the present study, we found that the expression
of miR-128 was decreased in the lung cancer stem cells.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the down-regulation
of miR-128 was associated with the gefitinib resistance in
these cells. Overexpression of miR-128 was then found
to increase the sensitivity of PC9-CSCs to gefitinib and
therefore inhibited the effect of gefitinib on enriching the
CSCs population in vitro and in vivo. Thus, for the first
time, we reported that miR-128 can reverse the resistance
and enhance the anti-tumor effect of gefitinib on NSCLC
by decreasing the CSCs population.
EGFR amplification or mutation occurs in multiple
cancers, especially NSCLC. These EGFR mutated
lung cancer cells (such as PC9) are sensitive to the

DISCUSSION
Increasing evidence has indicated that miRNAs
are related with the drug-resistance of the tumor cells to
cancer therapy [26-28]. Although these researches have
demonstrated the responsibility of miRNAs dysregulation
for the drug-resistance, the role of miRNAs in regulating
the drug-resistance of CSCs is not clear. Reports have
indicated that miR-128 acts as a tumor suppressor in
several cancers. In these studies, miR-128 inhibits cell
proliferation, migration and invasion of the cancer [29, 30].

EGFR-TKIs including gefitinib. Therefore the NSCLC
patients could benefit from the gefitinib treatment
[31, 32]. In the EGFR pathway, the activation of EGFR
leads to the phosphorylation of PI3K and the subsequent
generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
(PIP3), which in turn triggers the AKT. The activated AKT
can promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis. Thus, the
PI3K/AKT pathway contributes to the tumor development
[33–35]. Interestingly, according to the results of this study,
we found the gefitinib failed to suppress the activation
of PI3K/AKT pathway in the lung cancer stem cells
in vitro and in vivo, whereas the EGFR signaling could
be inhibited by this kind of EGFR-TKI. We therefore
demonstrated that the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway
was independent on the EGFR signaling in the lung cancer
stem cells.
C-met is the receptor for hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF). The HGF/c-met signaling was reported
to promote the tumorigenicity in a variety of manners
including the highly oncogenic PI3K/AKT pathway
[36, 37]. Researches have indicated that inhibition of

c-met and its downstream signaling could be the potential
strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cancer
[38]. Furthermore, the activation of c-met pathway
was identified as an important mechanism of acquired
resistance to gefitinib [39]. Recently, it’s reported that
c-met is inhibited by miRNAs in lung cancer, and the
miRNAs/c-met axis has been proved to be associated with
the gefitinib resistance [40].
In this study, we demonstrated that the gene of
c-met was overexpressed in the lung cancer stem cells. We
also proved that the miR-128/c-met axis determined the
sensitivity of the lung cancer stem cells gefitinib in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, combination with gefitinib and
miR-128 inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway. Subsequently,
the PC9–CSCs underwent the collapse of mitochondria,
release of ROS, cleavage of caspases, and finally, the
apoptosis occurred. These results provide several pieces
of evidence to prove that overexpression of miR-128
is able to reverse the gefitinib-resistant lung cancer
stem cells by inhibiting the c-met/PI3K/AKT pathway
(Figure 8). Therefore, combination with miR-128 and

the role of miR-128 in vivo, the stable PC9 cell line
overexpressed miR-128 was generated. Briefly, we
purchased the recombinant lentivirus which contains
miR-128 precusor sequence from the Shanghai Genechem
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The precusor sequence of
miR-128 is as follows: 5ʹ-UGAGCUGUUGGAUUCGGGGC
CGUAGCACUGUCUGAGAGGUUUACAUUUCUCACA
GUGAACCGGUCUCUUUUUCAGCUGCUUC-3ʹ. Then,
1 × 104 PC9 cells were transfected with 5 × 105 transducing
units of lentivirus, and the cells were selected with 1 μg/ml
puromycin for 2 weeks.

EGFR-TKIs could be attractive treatments for patients
with NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Four-week-old female nude mice (BALB/c, nu/nu;
17-22 g in weight) were purchased from the Shanghai
Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China) and kept
in a room under a 12 h artificial light/dark cycle with
free access to food and water. Animal care and the
experimental procedures in this study were approved by
the Animal Care Committee of First Affiliated Hospital,
School of Medicine, Zhejiang University and complied
with the recommendations of the Chinese guidelines for
the care and use of laboratory animals.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase real time PCR
(qRT-PCR)
RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The reverse transcription
of miR-128 is performed by using Hairpinit™ miR
qPCR quantification kit (GenePharma, China). Then,
the real time PCR was performed in triplicate using the
SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The expression of miR-128
was determined using the 2-∆∆CT analysis method [41]
taking the U6 snRNA as the internal control.

Cell culture
The NSCLC cell line PC9 was purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (USA). For sorting the
PC9-CSCs, the PC9 cells were stained with CD133-FITC
antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) for 20 min at room
temperature. Then the CD133+ PC9 cells were sorted as
the PC9-CSCs on a FACS vantage (FACSCALIBUR,
BD Biosciences, USA). In addition, the CD133- PC9
cells were sorted and considered as the PC9-non-CSCs.
Cells were cultured in DMEM basic medium (Gibco,
USA) contained with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco)
at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. To evaluate

Transfection
The c-met expression vector was conducted by

were synthesized by RiboBio Co. Ltd. (China). The
sequence of miR-128 and miR-NC are as follows:
5ʹ-UCACAGUGAACCGGUCUCUUU-3ʹ (miR-128),
5ʹ-UGUCCUCCU GGAAUUACACGU-3ʹ (miR-NC).
For transfection, cells were seeded and transfected with
2 mg/ml c-met vector, 50 pmol/ml miR-128 mimics or
miR-NC using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s guidance.

To construct the c-met 3ʹUTR reporter plasmid, the
putative binding sites of miR-128 in the 3ʹUTR of the
human c-met gene was amplified and inserted downstream
of the luciferase gene in the luciferase reporter pGL3
Luciferase Reporter Vectors (Promega, USA) and named
pGL3-c-met. The mutant c-met reporter was created by
mutating the seed regions of the miR-128 binding sites
(CACUGUGA) by using the site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Takara, Japan) and named pGL3-mutant c-met.
For luciferase reporter assay, cells were seeded and cotransfected with 50 pmol/ml miR-128 mimics together
with 2 mg/ml Firefly luciferase reporters and 100 ng/ml
Renilla luciferase pRL-TK vector (Promega). Firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities were measured consecutively
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell viability assay
A total of 5 × 103 cells were seeded into 96-well
plates and grown for 24 h post-transfection. Then,
cells were incubated in gefitinib for another 48 h.
Subsequently, 20 ml 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (5 mg/ml, SigmaAldrich, USA) was added and incubated at 37°C for
4 hours. Following incubation, the media was carefully
removed and 150 μl of DMSO was added at room
temperature for 30 min. The absorbance in each well was
measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Sunrise
Microplate Reader, TECAN, Switzerland). In addition, the
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of gefitinib
to the PC9-CSCs and PC9-non-CSCs was calculated
according to the viability curves.

Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP, ∆Ψm) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
After treatment, the MMP was detected using the
5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl
imidacarbo
cyanine iodide (JC-1, Molecular Probes, USA) as the
indicator according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For measurement of ROS, the dihydroethidium
(DHE, Molecular Probes) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Both of the MMP and ROS
were analyzed on the flow cytometry.

Western blot analysis
After treatment, proteins were isolated with RIPA
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), and then
quantified using the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad, USA).
Approximately 50 µg of total proteins were then separated
by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF
membrane (Millipore, USA). Membranes were incubated
in 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and then
incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-EGFR, antiphosphorylated EGFR, anti-PI3K, anti-phosphorylated

from Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4°C. A
fluorescent goat anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology)
secondary antibody was used and the protein bands were
then detected with an enhanced chemilu-minescence
detection kit (Pierce, USA). The level of β-actin was used
to normalize the protein levels.

Tumor growth in nude mice
An equal number (5 × 106) of PC9 cells transfected
with lentivirus-miR-128 (LV-miR-128) or lentiviruscontrol (LV-control) were harvested and washed. The
experimental mice were randomized into four groups
(8 mice/group). For the tumorigenesis assay, two groups of
mice were subcutaneously injected with LV-control PC9
cells (for LV-control group and LV-control + gefitinib
group, respectively), and two groups of mice were
subcutaneously injected with LV-miR-128 PC9 cells (for
LV-miR-128 group and LV-miR-128 + gefitinib group,
respectively). The tumor volume (V) was calculated
according to the formula: length × (width2)/2. In LVcontrol + gefitinib group and LV-miR-128 + gefitinib
group, the mice began to receive the gefitinib treatment
(30 mg/kg/d, via gavage for two weeks) through oral
administration once daily when the tumors reached a
mean volume of 100 mm3 (42). The mice were monitored
every three days for tumor formation using the calipers.
Nude mice were euthanized at the experimental end-point
(31 days post-injection).

Apoptosis analysis
After treatment, cells were stained with PI and
Annexin-V (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 min at room
temperature according to the manufacturer’s guidance.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified using the
flow cytometry.
