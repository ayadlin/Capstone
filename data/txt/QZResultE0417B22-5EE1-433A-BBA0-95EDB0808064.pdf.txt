ABSTRACT
The immunotherapeutic catumaxomab targets EpCAM positive cancers and is
approved for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. To assess the safety of
intravenous applications a phase 1 clinical trial was initiated. Treatment of EpCAM positive
tumor patients with catumaxomab caused dose dependent hepatitis as evidenced by
significant elevations in serum alanine- and aspartate aminotransferases, bilirubin,
fGT and induction of the acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) and the cytokines
IL6 and IL8. The first patient receiving 10μg catumaxomab experienced fatal acute
liver failure which led to the termination of the study. Immmunopathology revealed
catumaxomab to bind via its Fc-fragment to FcfR-positive Kupffer cells to stimulate
CRP, chemokine and cytokine release. The observed CD3+T-cell margination at
activated hepatic macrophages exacerbated T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Strikingly,
the combined Kupffer/T-cell responses against liver cells did not require hepatocytes
to be EpCAM-positive. Catumaxomab’s off-target activity involved T-cell mediated
lysis of the granzyme B cell death pathway and the molecular interaction of hepatic
sinusoidal macrophages with T-cells induced cytolytic hepatitis. Although the bile
ducts were surrounded by densely packed lymphocytes these rarely infiltrated the
ducts to suggest an intrahepatic cholestasis as the cause of hyperbilirubinaemia.
Lastly, evidence for the programming of memory T-cells was observed with one
patient that succumbed to his cancer six weeks after the last catumaxomab infusion.
In conclusion, our study exemplifies off-target hepatotoxicity with molecularly
targeted therapy and highlights the complexities in the clinical development of
immunotherapeutic antibodies.

of EpCAM positive tumor cells without co-stimulation

the tumor site results in complex immune reactions with
transient and primarily local cytokine release, antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
phagocytosis of tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION
In 2009 the immunotherapeutic antibody
Catumaxomab (Removab) was approved for the treatment
of peritoneal carcinomatosis by the European Medicine
Agency. This bi-specific (antiEpCAM & antiCD3)
trifunctional (FCγ Receptors) antibody binds to the
epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM, to CD3+T-cells
and to macrophages as well as dendritic- and NK cells via

with chemotherapy refractory EpCAM positive cancers a
phase I, open label, dose escalating trial was carried out
[2]. The study revealed dose dependent hepatotoxicity of
different grades with one patient experiencing fulminant
fatal acute liver failure (ALF) which led to the termination
of the study. In pursue of mechanisms a range of liver
function tests and cytokines in the systemic regulation
were evaluated and complemented by comprehensive
histopathology and immunohistochemistry studies as to
inform on the pathomechanism involved.

remission of lung metastases, and histopathology confirmed
lung lesions to be colon cancer derived metastases.
Before study admission the clinical laboratory values
were mostly within normal range although a few parameters
were elevated to protocol compatible CTCAE Grade 1
(Table 1). Specifically, under the 3rd line chemotherapy,
liver function tests were increased to CTCAE Grade 1 and
remained increased during therapy. At regular intervals the
performed computed tomography evidenced progressive
disease in form of an increased seize of several lung
metastases but also revealed hepatic steatosis presumably
due to the patient’s higher BMI score of 36.7.
The patient was admitted to the Kaiser-FranzJosef Spital of Vienna, Austria to obtain an experimental
therapy in the frame of a phase I clinical trial of
intravenous catumaxomab and was the first to receive
the dosage of 10μg of catumaxomab as 6-hour infusion
under premedication with 1g of paracetamol to suppress
treatment related chill symptoms. The general health
condition of the patient was considered to be good but
during the catumaxomab infusion the patient started
to chill and developed fever (up to 38.9°C). This was
not unexpected and was commonly observed amongst
patients receiving catumaxomab. In compliance with the
study protocol the NSAID ketoprofen was administered
at a dose of 50 mg i.v. as a short-term infusion at two
consecutive instances one hour apart. Subsequently,
the symptoms improved, however, within the next
hour a significant decrease in blood pressure (106/55
mmHg) was noted; therefore an additional 1000 mL
NaCl was infused via the port-a-cath. At the end of the
catumaxomab infusion a further 1 gram of paracetamol
was given intravenously as foreseen in the protocol.
About 1.5h after termination of the catumaxomab
infusion the patient experienced nausea and vomiting
(CTCAE Grade 1) in addition to CTCAE Grade 2
vertigo. The patient was given 8 mg of ondansetron for
the treatment of nausea and vomiting as well as 1000
mL lactate Ringer solution to treat symptoms of vertigo.
Two hours post catumaxomab infusion laboratory
values for leukocytes, thrombocytes and albumin were
decreased but increased for liver function and coagulation
parameters (Table 1). After an additional 30 minutes the
patient experienced aggravating upper abdominal pain
and therefore received 10 mg morphine hydrochloride.
Five hours post catumaxomab infusion the abdominal
pain got worse despite the various analgesic medications
and due to the deteriorating condition of the patient
a mesenteric infarction was suspected. Therefore, an
abdominal CT-scan was performed. This revealed a
faintly contrasted liver and portal vein with fluid retention
around the duodenal knee and partially around the
pancreas. The hepatic segment of the inferior vena cava
appeared flattened, and the hepatic veins were sparsely
calibrated and weakly contrasted. Notwithstanding, the
arterial vessels, particularly the mesenteric vessels were
without pathological findings. The condition of the patient

RESULTS
The findings of a Phase 1 trial in patients with
chemotherapy refractory EpCAM positive cancers
were recently published [2]. As shown in Figure 1 the
transaminases ALT, AST as well as bilirubin and γGT
increased dose dependently when assayed 24h after the
2nd catumaxomab infusion, however, alkaline phosphatase,
albumin and urea was unchanged. Alike, C-reactive
protein was dose dependently increased as was Il-6
and IL-8 while the other cytokines, i.e. IL2, IL10 and
interferon gamma did not reach statistical significance
when compared to pre-dose values 6h after the first
infusion. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase one patient
each of the 2μg and 4μg dose had extraordinary high LDH
values, and these are marked individually in Figure 1.
Likewise for bilirubin there was one patient each per dose
group with extremely low laboratory values, i.e. up to 250fold less when compared to the mean of the dose group.
Once again, these are marked individually as a diamond
symbol in Figure 1.
Most patients at the 4 and 7μg dose developed
anti-drug-antibodies (ADA) after the 4th catumaxomab
infusion, and the occurrence of ADA coincided with
a significant improvement of the observed hepatitis.
Nonetheless, the first patient receiving the 10μg
catumaxomab infusion experienced fulminant fatal ALF,
and the epicrisis is given below.

A case of fatal acute liver failure
A 49 year old female patient diagnosed with stage
IV colorectal cancer (CRC) and multiple lung but no liver
metastasis was scheduled to receive a 10μg catumaxomab
infusion. The patient history prior to the study therapy
involved three lines of systemic therapies after status
hemicolectomy for the treatment of advanced CRC and
consisted of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), folinic acid (FA),
capecitabene, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab.
The first-line regimen (from 11/2009 to 5/2010) comprised
capecitabine/oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, the second-line
therapy (from 10/2010 to 11/2010) involved FUFA and
irinotecan. The third-line therapy (from 12/2010 to 1/2012)
consisted of FUFA and irinotecan in combination with
bevacizumab. Only the first-line regimen led to objective

Cytokine release and innate immunity response
to catumaxomab

continued to worsen with a severe drop in blood pressure
(81/52 mmHg), blood gas values of pO2 of 87 mmHg,
arterial O2 of 85% and alarming changes in blood lactate,
pH and coagulation parameters, i.e. >15 mmol/L, pH
6.86 and INR>5, respectively and required intensive care
submission. The patient became increasingly unstable in
her hemodynamic condition with obligatory high dose
noradrenaline treatment while the metabolic acidosis
remained unimproved. Approximately 24h post infusion
of catumaxomab the patient died from fulminant acute
liver failure (ALF); the performed autopsy confirmed
ALF as the cause of death and a causal relationship to
catumaxomab treatment was considered to be certain.

When compared to maxima seen after 2 and 4μg
catumaxomab infusions the deceased patient had 15and 5-fold higher serum IL-6 concentration; nonetheless
it did not differ to peak IL-6 serum concentrations after
infusion of 7μg catumaxomab as determined in a phase
I trial [2]. Importantly, IL-6 plays a decisive role in liver
regeneration and was shown to enhance cell survival
through activation of hepatoprotective pathways [3].
Conversely, peak serum IL-8 concentration was only about
40% of peak concentrations of the 7μg catumaxomab
dose. This cytokine is elevated in serum of patients with
chronic liver disease and is known to stimulate activation
of neutrophils, macrophages and T-cells via interaction
with CXCR1 and CXCR2 therefore contributing to hepatic
inflammation [4]. The reasonable good relationship
between IL-6 and IL-8 serum levels amongst patients
receiving different catumaxomab doses is suggestive for a
coordinated dose dependent immune response.
A further finding was the significant rise in TNFα.
When compared with the 2, 4 and 7μg catumaxomab doses
the peak serum TNFα levels were 7-, 34- and 1.6-fold
increased at the end of the infusion. The deceased patient
had the highest TNFα serum concentration measured so
far and ssensitization of hepatocytes to TNFα and other
death receptor pathways imposes high risk for liver injury.
As shown in Table 2 several pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines were significantly elevated with possible spilling
from the liver into systemic circulation to perpetuate ALF.

Clinical laboratory findings
Changes of several liver function tests, i.e. AST,
ALT and albumin were highly significantly regulated
and associated with those of LDH and cholesterol
(released from membranes due to massive cell damage)
indicating massive acute cytolytic hepatitis. Importantly,
the cytokine mediated imbalance between coagulant
and anticoagulant adjust components of the coagulation
system. Inflammation induced activation of coagulation
is counteracted by several mechanisms and includes
regulation of soluble inhibitors and tissue factor pathway
inhibitors (TFPI). Approximately 9 hours post infusion an
INR>5, a highly significant increase in D-dimers (> 58fold) and a highly significant decrease in fibrinogen to <
30% were observed thus evidencing an “overshooting” of
the anticoagulant pathway.

Owing to its molecular functions we hypothesized
a direct interaction of catumaxomab with hepatocytes.
Strikingly, the patients hepatocytes were EpCAM negative
(see histopathology/immunohistochemistry section).
Therefore, alternative causes of this case of fatal ALF
were explored as detailed below.

not confirmed by electron microscopy it was established
that crystals of uric acid function as second signal required
for an activation of the inflammasome and downstream
caspases to reinforce cellular damage and programmed
cell death programs. Taken collectively, HMGB1 and
serum uric acid were significantly elevated. We therefore
hypothesized catumaxomab to influence DAMP sensing
immune cells and an activation of an inflammasome. To
further probe for a mechanism of liver injury the potential
interplay of neutrophils, Kupffer cells and other hepatic
accessory cells (NK/NKT and DC) cells was investigated
by histopathology.

Catumaxomab induced sterile inflammation
Research into acute liver failure is highly suggestive
for harmed hepatocytes to release damage associated
molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) [5]. These interact
with DAMP receptor of sensing immune cells via Toll
like receptors such as TLR-4 and release inflammatory
cytokines as part of programmed “sterile inflammation”
[6]. Several molecular interaction partners of DAMPs are
known and include heat shock protein 70, uric acid, ATP,
nucleic acids as well as high-mobility group box-1 protein
(HMGB1). Once released by damaged cells HMGB1
acts as danger molecule and triggers the inflammatory
signalling cascade. Current research suggests
posttranslational modifications such as oxidation and
acetylation to modulate the pro-inflammatory potential of
HMGB1 as danger signal [7]. Furthermore, a recent study
showed HMGB1 to be significantly elevated in colorectal
cancer patients [8] to possibly influence the risk for sterile
inflammation and hence idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity.
To probe for serum and tissue HMGB1 expression
both Western Blotting and immunohistochemistry
was performed. As depicted in Figure 2 marked serum
expression of HMGB1 was observed. Next to the expected
30 kDa immunoreactive band two additional bands at a
molecular weight of about 50 and 52 kDa were observed.
Based on the molecular weight of HMGB1 (30kDa) and
the molecular weight of the light chain of IgG1 (22kDa)
binding of IgG1 to HMGB1 is assumed. Specifically, the
binding of HMGB1 to several proteins including IgG1 was
confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of serum proteins
with anti-HMGB1 antibodies [9]. Depletion of albumin
and IgG from serum confirmed binding of HMGB1 to
immunoglobulin. A further important finding was the
significant increase in serum uric acid (Table 1). Although

In pursuit of mechanisms histological studies
were carried out (Figure 3) and next to H&E staining
immunohistochemistry involved the T-cell marker CD3,
CD4, CD8, the T-cell intracellular and granule-associated
protein antigen-1 (TIA-1), perforin and granzyme B,
caspase 3, the endothelial /sinusoidal cell markers

hepatocytes.
Microscopic examination revealed a massively
congested liver hallmarked by diffuse hemorrhage,
sinusoidal degeneration and severe macrovesicular
steatosis with signs of ballooning degeneration (Figure
3, A1-A3). At the higher magnification acute hepatic
necrosis with fresh cellular debris, nuclear fragments
and scarcely intermingled granulocytes between residual
lipid droplets were seen (Figure 3, A2, A3). Central veins
appeared collapsed while in the periportal zone shedding
of cytoplasm at remnants of hepatocellular trabeculae
was suspected. Importantly, hepatocytes were negative
for EpCAM; thus, a direct molecular interaction of
catumaxomab with liver cells was excluded (Figure 3,
B1). However, the lung tumor of this patient was EpCAM
positive (Figure 3, B2) though no evidence for antibody
dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC), tumor lysis and

phagocytosis by macrophages was obtained to possibly
suggest a regulatory T cell-mediated suppression of tumor
clearance.
A prominent finding was the marked lymphocytic
infiltration of portal tracts (Figure 3, D1) thus evidencing
acute hepatic inflammation. Immunohistochemistry
revealed the lymphocytes to be CD3, CD4 & CD8
positive T-cell (Figure 3 B3, C1, C2). The finding that
CD3 positive lymphocytes surrounded bile ducts indicates
catumaxomab binding to EpCAM positive bile duct
epithelium even though their intraductual infiltration was
barely seen (Figure 3, C1). When compared to hepatocytes
the bile duct epithelium was less harmed, i.e. edema and
occasionally desquamation of cells; nonetheless, due to
the severe hepatitis an acute intrahepatic cholestasis was
suspected with serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase
and γGT laboratory values being significantly elevated
in this patient (Table 1). Staining for CK7 revealed focal
periportal bile duct proliferation (Figure 3, G3) possibly
due to a preexisting lesion.
Staining of CD68 revealed marked Kupffer cell
activation (Figure 3, D3) and catumaxomab’s ability to
interact with FC fragment sensing macrophages likely
contributed to their activation. The local cytokine release
mediated by activated Kupffer- and sinusoidal endothelial
cells must have critically sensitized hepatocytes for lysis.
Overall, increased T-cell margination at remnants of
the sinusoids was observed (Figure 3, G3, D1). Indeed,
the extraordinary change in serum ALT, AST, LDH and
cholesterol is testimony to a massive acute cytolytic
hepatitis with cellular and plasma membrane constituents
draining into systemic circulation (Table 1, Figure 3, A3).
Some of the lymphocytic infiltrates were positive
for granzyme B and surrounded by a dust of exocytosed
granula, especially at the interphase (Figure 3, E1).
Consequently an up-regulation of cell-death inducing
enzymes is seen. Conversely, cytoplasmic expression
of TIA-1 was minimal (Figure 3, E2); note, depletion
of TIA-1 was shown to promote cell proliferation [10].
Specifically, this RNA/DNA binding protein participates
in the transcriptional control of pro-inflammatory
cytokines; its minimal expression can be considered as
an adaptive response to support cell survival. Additional
evidence for an immune mediated acute liver failure stems
from HMGB1 immunohistochemistry with its increased
hepatocellular cytosolic expression (Figure 3, E3). This
protein was repeatedly shown to play a crucial role in
the host response to sterile inflammation; its inhibition
attenuates damage induced by erroneous programmed
innate immune cells.
For comparison, a 65 year old male patient
diagnosed with CRC stage IV according to UICC with
multiple lung and mediastinal lymph node metastases
as well as metastatic infiltration of the hypophysis
but no liver metastasis was studied. Therapy involved
surgical removal, i.e. deep anterior rectal resection with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ascendostomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy initially
with capecitabine in the year 2008 and subsequently with
bevacizumab, capecitabine and oxaliplatin in 2009. The
2nd line therapy consisted of bevacizumab, capecitabine
and irinotecan in 2010. The 3rd and 4th line therapy
comprised lenalidomid and tegafur-uracil in the years
2010 and 2011, and the 5th line therapy was based on
mitomycin C and 5-FU also given in 2011.
This patient participated in the phase I trial and
received eleven catumaxomab infusions at a dose of
7μg per infusion during the period January 23rd until
April 2nd, 2012 [2]. The treatment was reasonable well
tolerated; nonetheless the patient succumbed to his cancer
6 weeks after completion of the treatment cycle.
Histopathology revealed the liver microarchitecture
to be moderately altered (Figure 4, A1). The trabeculae
appeared partly fragmented and dissociated into single
cells and a low grade reticular fibrosis is suspected (Figure
4, A1). Frequently, hepatocytes appeared small and slightly
basophilic to indicate immature regenerating hepatocytes
while part of the trabeculae appeared bi-layered with
increased liver cell polyploidization; additionally
binuclear hepatocytes were recurrently observed to
document increased liver regeneration. Besides, a
primarily centrolobular macrovesicular steatosis of 10 to
20% and intranuclear glycogen inclusion of hepatocytes at
the periportal zone was seen (Figure 4, A1-3). Some of the
sinusoidal endothelial cells and the resident macrophages
were moderately activated and enlarged; others presented
their typical clinging appearance (Figure 4, B1, B3).
As seen with the ALF case an increased T-cell
margination at activated Kupffer cells and/or endothelial
cells was observed (Figure 4 B1, B3, C2) 6 weeks
after the last catumxomab infusion to possibly suggest
catumaxomab induced programming of memory T-cells.
Alike, hepatocytes of this male patient were negative for
EpCAM. Therefore, a direct interaction of catumaxomab
with liver cells was excluded (Figure 4, C1) and the
observed sinusoidal margination of T-cells must have
been endorsed by the antibody through its binding
specificities for Kupffer and T-cells (Figure 4 B1, B3, C2,
D1). Moreover, marked portal T-cell infiltrates (Figure 4,
C2, C3) though less CD8 positive T-cells (Figure 4, D1)
were seen when compared with the ALF case described
above and some of the T-lymphocytes were positive
for granzyme B and surrounded by a delicate dust of
exocytosed granula, especially at the interphase (Figure 4,
D2) but were basically negative for T1A (Figure 4, D3).
As shown in Figure 4 A2 partial destruction of the limiting
plate as well as portal tract fibrogenesis with initial septal
extensions was observed. Moreover, T-cell infiltrates
particularly at the periportal interphase with focal active
inflammatory cell aggregates are notable findings (Figure
4, D1, A2) and the septal extensions of portal tracts with
hepatocellular collapse and initial fibrosis were also
infiltrated by T-cells (Figure 4, D1).

DISCUSSION

Note, independent studies revealed bile duct
epithelium to be EpCAM positive and therefore
constitutes a bona fide target of catumaxomab. In the
present study densely packed lymphocytic infiltrates
surrounding the bile ducts were observed (Figure 4, D1,
D3); however, the lymphocytes rarely infiltrated the ducts
itself and the ductual epithelium was mostly intact even
though some displayed moderate swelling (Figure 4, C3).
Notwithstanding, newly formed bile duct proliferations
were seen at the edge of the portal tract and within
septal extensions (Figure 4, E2, E3, A2) while staining
for the CD34 antigen informed on a slightly extended
periportal vascular network (Figure 4, B2) in response
to hepatocellular destruction at the limiting plate. Taken
collectively, this patient presented pronounced portalperiportal inflammatory cell infiltrates fulfilling the
criteria of an interface-hepatitis possible as a result of
catumaxomab treatment.
A striking similarity amongst both cases is the
pronounced sinusoidal T-cell margination along Kupffer
cells to suggest the programing of memory T-cell
and T-cell mediated lysis of hepatocytes even though
hepatocytes do not express EpCAM.

Pathogenesis of catumaxomab induced liver
injury - towards a general hypothesis –
Based on the performed histopathology and clinical
observations obtained during a phase I dose escalating
trial a mechanism for catumaxomab’s liver liability
can be hypothesized (Figure 5). Specifically, upon drug
administration all patients developed dose dependent
hepatitis of different grades with significant serum
elevations in ALT, AST, bilirubin and CRP. Most patients
experienced chills and pyrexia while plasma cytokine
profiling evidenced IL-6 and IL-8 to be significantly
increased with peak concentrations at 6 to 9 hours after
the start of the infusion. However, no significant change in
absolute and relative immune cell count was observed and
IFN-γ and TNF-α became undetectable or were very low
after repeated treatment [2]. Some patient also developed
significant increases in INR (mainly CTCAE Grade 1) to
further document liver injury.
Not unexpectedly consecutive catumaxomab
infusions induced neutralizing anti-drug antibody (ADA)

responses and patients with increased ADA titers were
protected, at least in part from liver injury. Owing to
its molecular functions catumaxomab binds via its Fcfragment to FcγR-positive Kupffer cells to increase their
activity and to stimulate macrophage dependent CRP,
chemokine and cytokine release. The increase in local
CRP concentration enhances phagocytosis by Kupffer
cells [11] but also stimulates lymphocytic activation
and hepatic infiltration as part of the innate immune
response. The finding of sinusoidal T-cell margination
in close proximity to Kupffer cells is of uttermost
importance; it resulted from the binding specificities
of the antibody for CD3 positive T-cell and Kupffer
cells. Such an antibody mediated “molecular bridging”
between T-cells and hepatic macrophages induced a T-cell
response and exacerbated local cytokine release and T-cell
mediated cytotoxicity. The findings that one patient who
succumbed to his cancer 6 weeks after completion of 11
consecutive treatment cycles still presented sinusoidal
T-cell margination at activated Kupffer cells may
suggest programming of memory T-cells in response
to catumaxomab treatment. Importantly, the immunemediated liver injury induced by catumaxomab does not
require hepatocytes to express EpCAM and as seen in
the fatal ALF case involved the granzyme B cell death
pathway. Moreover, histopathology revealed densely
packed lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding bile ducts,
however rarely infiltrated bile ducts. Therefore, it remains
to be determined whether catumaxomab binding to
EpCAM positive bile duct cells contributed to liver injury.
Adding to complexity is the significant up-regulation of
the DAMP molecule HMGB1 in addition to the cytokines
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8 to counteract the homeostatic
response during organ repair.
A summary of the possible mechanism of
catumaxomab induced liver injury is depicted in Figure
5. It should be noted that an inflammasome constitutes an
intracellular machinery for the maturation of IL-1 and IL18 [12] with HMGB1 functioning as an “alarm signal”
and potent proinflammatory cytokine in multiple signaling
pathways [13]. In the present study a highly significant
induction of serum HMGB1 was observed and included
dose dependent increases for a range of cytokines;
however the cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 were not assayed.
Hence, an inflammasome mediated mechanism of ALF
remains indecisive even though sterile inflammation as a
cause of ALF remains unquestionable.

[14] and there is experimental evidence for paracetamol
to induce the synthesis and release of DAMP molecules
into systemic circulation in addition to caspase cleavage
of cytokeratin-18 (K18), i.e. an intermediate filament
protein expressed by epithelial cells to function in cell
structure and integrity. Indeed, DAMPs and K18 serum
markers were uniquely associated with systemic immune
cell activation but not necessarily influx of inflammatory
cells into damaged liver parenchyma as defined by
histopathology [15]. Furthermore, paracetamol-induced
hepatotoxicity in mice is Toll like receptor 9 and Nalp3
inflammasome dependent [16, 17]. Moreover, cytokines
repress the metabolic competence of the liver and activity
of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases required for
the detoxification of drugs as was repeatedly observed in
patients with SIRS [18, 19]. It is tempting to speculate
that paracetamol i.v. administration contributed to DAMP
production and associated inflammation thus contributing
to ALF.

Hepatotoxicity with targeted therapies
Apart from paracetamol as a possible culprit
bystander our study exemplifies the risk for liver injury
by modulating the immune system with molecularly
targeted therapies. In the present study extraordinarily
small amounts of the antibody were given over a 6 hour
infusion, however changing the route of administration
caused dose dependent hepatitis even though liver cells
do not express EpCAM, i.e. the principal antigen required
for the molecular interaction with catumaxomab. It should
be noted that average Cmax serum concentrations of about
560 pg/ml were observed in previously performed clinical
trials after i.p. administration of 150 mg of catumaxomab
and a similar Cmax of 624 pg/ml was determined in the
patient with fulminant fatal acute liver failure reported
in the present study. Importantly, the liver is a major
site for T-cell clearance and the removal of apoptotic as
well as non-apoptotic but activated CD8+ T cells [20].
Given that all T cells express CD3 an anti-CD3 activation
of effector T cells by catumaxomab can be assumed
leading to non-specific killing of hepatocytes. Moreover,
variability of T-cell CD3 membrane expression influences
the capacity for T cell activation and may determine the
risk for hepatitis among individual patients [21]. Besides,
catumaxomab functions in a non-MHC restricted manner.
Therefore, the observed cytolytic hepatitis would not
require hepatocytes to express EpCAM but involves the
combined activity of cytokines, granzyme B and perforin.
Alike, a recent report highlights the risk for
hepatotoxicity for new combination therapies [22].
Specifically, in a phase 1 clinical trial the BRAF inhibitor
Vemurafenib and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
antigen 4 blocking antibody Ipilimumab was given in
combination. Although both agents obtained regulatory
approval and differ distinctively in their mode of action the

Paracetamol - an additional culprit in ALF?
In line with the clinical protocol several analgesic
and anti-inflammatory medications were foreseen and
included 2 grams of paracetamol given intravenously
within 6 hours, i.e. 1 gram at the beginning and 1 gram at
the end of the catumaxomab infusion. There are reported
cases of acetaminophen induced ALF at therapeutic doses

Notably, hepatic reactions with Ipilimumab treatment alone
are considered to be uncommon, nonetheless guidance for
the management of liver injury is available [23, 24].

were blocked for 5 min with protein-block serum free
reagent (ZytoChem-Plus HRP Polymer-Kit, reagent 1)
and incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min (see
supplementary Table S2).
The bound primary antibodies or bridging antibodies
were incubated with labelled polymer HRP Anti-Rabbit
or anti-mouse secondary antibody (ZytoChem-Plus HRP
Polymer-Kit, reagent 2) for 20 minutes. Subsequently,
the reaction was developed and visualized with reagent 3
of the ZytoChem-Plus HRP Polymer-Kit and by placing
the slides in a moist chamber at room temperature and
allowing for an incubation time of 30 min.
Finally, the sections were counterstained with
Haematoxylin for 5 min, washed under running warm tap
water for 10 minutes and dehydrated in a cabinet at 60°C
for 20 minutes, coverslipped and examined under a light
microscope.

Therapeutic strategies in sterile inflammation of
the liver
The development of novel therapies for the
treatment of sterile inflammation of the liver is the subject
of intense research and inhibition of transmission signal 1
and/or signal 2 or its downstream partners may prevent the
formation of an active inflammasome [25, 26].
Specifically, HMGB1 may interact with a number
of receptors including RAGE and TLRs to promote
inflammation [13] and inhibition of HMGB1 activity is
an important strategy to alleviate drug induced sterile
inflammation.
Immunomodulatory drugs regulate HMGB1 release
from activated human monocytes [27]. It is of considerable
importance that a previously performed clinical trial
evidenced 40 mg of dexamethasone to be effective in
ameliorating catumaxomab induced hepatitis [28]. Apart
from serum HMGB1 elevated CRP values may serve as
a biomarker to identify patients at risk for ALF. Patients
with macrovesicular steatosis / NASH are at higher risk
for serious liver injury. Hence, uttermost care should be
taken with such patients. Avoidance of paracetamol and
the timely monitoring for serum markers of inflammation
including HMGB1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines is
recommended.

Statistical analysis of the liver function data
Statistical significance testing of liver function tests
involved the unpaired, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test
with two tails and in the case of cytokines the unpaired
t-test with Welch correction using the GraphPad software
Prism version 6.0, USA. Data are given as mean and
standard deviation.

CONCLUSION
Owing to catumaxomab’s molecular function an
erroneous programming of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and
Kupffer cells against EpCAM-negative hepatocytes is
hypothesized. The local release of cytokines exacerbates
an immune mediated hepatotoxicity and in conjunction
with the release of DAMP molecules sterile inflammation
is sustained. The observed fulminant fatal liver failure
observed in a stage IV CRC patient with multiple lung
metastases is the result of a foudroyant disintegration
of liver cells (fulminant cytolytic hepatitis) and
clinicians should be cautious when changing the route of
administration of such medications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The patients’ characteristics are given in
supplementary Table S1 [2]. Blood samples were analyzed
for albumin, ALT, AST, γGT, AP, LDH and CRP using
commercially available test kits and the cytokines IL2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and
GM-CSF were measured by flow cytometry using the
commercially available CBA Flex Assay kits (Becton
Dickinson).
Histopathology involved H&E staining and
immunohistochemistry using the following procedures:
1 μm thick sections were deparaffinised and
rehydrated through a descending alcohol series followed
by a 4 min washing step in distilled H2O. Subsequently,
antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (pH 6)
in a water bath at 98°C for 30 minutes. The ZytoChemPlus HRP Polymer-Kit of Zytomed Systems, Germany
was used for immunohistochemistry. The slides were
rinsed with distilled H2O, and after a 5 min incubation
step in tris-buffered saline (washing buffer) endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% peroxidase
blocking reagent (Merck, Germany) for 5 min followed
by a second washing step. Thereafter, the sections
