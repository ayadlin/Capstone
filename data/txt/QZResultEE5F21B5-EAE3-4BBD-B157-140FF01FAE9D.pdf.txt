Cancer Cells by Promoting Degradation of MdmX

Abstract
Anticancer agent FL118 was recently identiﬁed in screening of small-molecule inhibitors of human survivin
expression. Although FL118 is a camptothecin analogue, its antitumor potency is much superior to other FDAapproved camptothecin analogues (irinotecan and topotecan). The mechanism of action (MOA) underlying the
antitumor effects of FL118 remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that FL118 activates tumor suppressor
p53 as a novel MOA in p53 wild-type cancer cells. Our studies show that this MOA involves an induction of
proteasomal degradation of MdmX, a critical negative regulator of p53, in a manner largely independent of ATMdependent DNA damage signaling pathway but dependent on E3-competent Mdm2. FL118 inhibits p53
polyubiquitination and monoubiquitination by Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex in cells and in cell-free systems. In
contrast, FL118 stimulates Mdm2-mediated MdmX ubiquitination. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that FL118
slightly decreases Mdm2–p53 interactions and moderately increases Mdm2–MdmX interactions, suggesting a
change of targeting speciﬁcity of Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex from p53 to MdmX, resulting in accelerated MdmX
degradation. As a result, p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex is reduced, which in turn activates p53
signaling. Activation of the p53 pathway by FL118 induces p53-dependent senescence in colorectal cancer cells.
However, in the absence of p53 or in the presence of MdmX overexpression, FL118 promotes p53-independent
apoptosis. These two distinct cellular consequences collectively contribute to the potent effects of FL118 to inhibit
clonogenic potential of colon cancer cells. This study identiﬁes a potential application of FL118 as an MdmX
inhibitor for targeted therapies. Cancer Res; 74(24); 7487–97. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Evasion of apoptosis is one of hallmarks of human cancer (1).
Damaged or unwanted cells are normally eliminated by apoptosis via extrinsic (2) and intrinsic apoptotic pathways (3).
Deregulation of apoptosis in cancer occurs frequently by overexpression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Bcl-2 family
antiapoptotic proteins. The IAP family proteins, such as survivin, cIAP, and XIAP, possess an evolutionarily conserved
domain of baculovirus IAP repeats. The Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, possess four
conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. Expression of these
proteins is upregulated by chromosomal translocation, transcriptional, or posttranscriptional mechanisms (4–6). These
proteins antagonize the proapoptotic activities of Bax/Bak and
BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Puma, and Noxa (7). In an effort
of screening for inhibitors of survivin expression, we identiﬁed
FL118 as a potent inhibitor of survivin expression (8).

Structurally, FL118 is a camptothecin analogue with structural features of the FDA-approved camptothecin analogues
irinotecan and topotecan, which are used for colon cancer
treatment. However, the mechanism of action (MOA) for FL118
is quite different from that of irinotecan and topotecan. First,
topotecan or SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan) are wellestablished topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors, but FL118 weakly inhibits TOP1-mediated in vitro DNA nicking (8). Second,
TOP1 mutation confers signiﬁcant resistance to camptothecin,
topotecan, and SN-38 but only mild resistance to FL118 (9, 10).
Third, FL118 selectively inhibits expression of survivin, XIAP,
cIAP2, and/or Mcl-1, but SN-38 and topotecan are 10 to 100 times
less effective in the inhibition of these genes (X. Liu and F. Li,
unpublished data; ref. 8). Nevertheless, FL118 exhibited superior
antitumor effects in mouse models of human colon and headand-neck cancer xenografts, when compared with topotecan
and irinotecan (8). FL118 caused complete tumor regression of
xenografted head-and-neck and colon tumors when administered either via intraperitoneal injection (8) or via an intravenous
injection in different formulations (11). The superior antitumor
effects of FL118 suggest that novel MOAs in addition to TOP1
inhibition underlie the potent antitumor effects of FL118.
TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene
in human cancer (12). In colon cancer, KRAS, APC, and p53
mutations are the most frequent cancer driver mutations with
p53 loss often occurs in the late stage of cancer progression (13,
14). Many chemotherapeutics including camptothecin activate
the p53 pathway (15, 16). p53 activation leads to growth arrest,

senescence, or apoptosis (12), via induction of p53 target genes
such as p21 for growth arrest (17) and/or senescence (18, 19), or
Puma and Noxa for apoptosis (20–22). p53-dependent apoptosis and senescence prevent lymphomagenesis and determine
lymphoma treatment outcomes in mouse models (23–27).
However, studies with colon cancer cell lines indicate that
p21 induction actually protects colon cancer cells from p53dependent apoptosis (28). How exactly p53 contributes to the
therapeutic effects of colon cancer therapies is not fully
addressed. Stress signaling activates p53 via disruption of
p53/Mdm2 feedback loop (29–35). We recently reported that
MdmX and Mdm2 form a polyubiquitination E3 ligase for p53
ubiquitin-dependent degradation (36) and MdmX stimulates
Mdm2-mediated p53 multiple monoubiquitination (36–38).
Therefore, Mdm2–MdmX complex is the key regulator of
p53 protein stability and involved in p53 activation (39). In
this report, we describe that FL118 induces MdmX degradation, leading to p53-dependent senescence in colon cancer
cells. This novel MOA for FL118 identiﬁes that MdmX is a
FL118 target that contributes to FL118-induced inhibition of
clonogenic growth of colon cancer cells.

In vivo p53 ubiquitination
In vivo p53 ubiquitination assay was performed with HCT-8
cells. Brieﬂy, whole cell lysates were denatured by 1% SDS
followed by boiling for 5 minutes. After diluted 10 times with a
buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% NP40, and 120
mmol/L NaCl followed by centrifugation at 22,000  g for 10
minutes, ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down with an
anti-ubiquitin antibody coupled with Western blotting for p53.
Alternatively, HCT116 and HCT116-p53/ cells transfected
with a His-ubiquitin plasmid were treated with or without 25
mmol/L MG132 in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L FL118
for 8 hours followed by His-tag pulldown as described previously (41) followed by Western blotting for p53.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, chemicals, and treatment
HCT116, HCT116-p53/, HCT116-p21/ cells were originally provided to Dr. Terry Beerman by Prof. B. Vogelstein
(Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). These cells were
received in 2004 and cultured in McCoy's 5A containing 10%
FBS in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The p53/mdm2/mdmx triple
knockout (TKO) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF; ref. 40)
were obtained from Gigi Lozano, MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX, in January, 2013. The genetic status of these cell
lines was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis and the last
testing was June, 2013. HCT-8 was used in our recent studies (8)
and originally purchased from the ATCC. TKO and HCT-8 lines
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS
(Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.) and antibiotics. Transfection was
carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 (Selleckchem; catalog no. S2619) was used at
10 to 25 mmol/L for 4- to 8-hour treatment.
Plasmids
HA-FLAG-MdmX and HA-Mdm2 plasmids for mammalian
and insect cell expression were described previously (36). The
mammalian expression plasmid for Hdm2 (human Mdm2),
pCHDM1B, was a gift from Dr. Jiandong Chen (H. Lee Mofﬁtt
Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa, FL) and
pcDNA3.1-HdmX was a gift from Dr. Gokul Das (Roswell Park
Cancer Institute). His-ubiquitin plasmid (pMT107) was a gift
from Dr. Dirk P. Bohmann (University of Rochester Medical
Center, Rochester, NY).

In vitro ubiquitination
In vitro assays for p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2–MdmX were
performed as described previously (36). Brieﬂy, reactions were
carried out at 30 C for 1 hour in a volume of 20 mL containing 40
mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmol/L DTT, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10
mmol/L of ubiquitin, 40 nmol/L E1, 350 nmol/L UbCH5c, 5
mmol/L ATP, 100 nmol/L p53, 200 nmol/L Mdm2, 200 nmol/L
MdmX, and different concentrations of FL118 or vehicle solvent DMSO, followed by Western blotting of p53 with DO-1.
Similar procedure was performed for MdmX ubiquitination
except for direct Western blotting with FLAG antibody or
immunoprecipitation with an ubiquitin antibody followed by
Western blotting for FLAG-HdmX.
Coimmunoprecipitation
HCT8 cells were treated with or without 10 nmol/L FL118 in
the presence of 10 mmol/L MG132 for 8 hours followed by lysis in
immunoprecipitation buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137
mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
PMSF (50 mg/mL), and aprotinin (1 mg/ml)]. Total protein
(500 mg) per sample was precleaned with 40 mL A-G beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before immunoprecipitation with 2
mg control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or MDM2 (ab-3)
antibody (Calbiochem) at 4 C overnight. After incubation with
40 mL A-G beads in a cold room for 3 hours followed by 5 times
washes with PBS containing 0.2% NP-40, proteins bound to A-G
beads were released in 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling
for 5 minutes and used for Western blotting with DO-1 for p53,
8C6 (Millipore) for MdmX, and ab-3 for Mdm2 (Calbiochem).
Clonogenic assay
HCT8 cells were infected with lentiviral particles expressing
control shRNA or shRNA for p53 knockdown (pLKO.1 from
Addgene) followed by selection with puromycin for one week
at 5 mg/mL. The cells were plated at 200 cells/well in 6-well

Senescence-associated b-gal assay
HCT8 cells were either treated with 10 nmol/L FL118 for
72 hours or left untreated, followed by additional 7-day culture.
Then the cells were ﬁxed and stained for senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) activity with a commercial kit

drug-treated groups for accurate colony counting. Cells were
treated with 0.15 to 20 nmol/L FL118 for 3 days followed by two
washes with PBS and replenished with drug-free complete
medium. After two weeks of culture in an incubator at 37 C, 5%
CO2, cells are ﬁxed and stained with crystal violet solution.
Colonies were deﬁned as >50 cells/colony.

Data analysis and quantiﬁcation of protein levels
Data plotting in relevant ﬁgures (Figs. 1A and B, 2D, 4, 5D,
and 6C) was made using Microsoft Excel. The values of each bar
are presented as mean  SD from at least three independent
assays. Statistical signiﬁcance among the mean values was
analyzed using a Student t test. The signiﬁcance (P value) was
set at the nominal level of 0.05 or less. The asterisk in Fig. 1A
and B represents the P value is less than 0.05. Proteins band
intensities were quantiﬁed using IMAGEJ software. The relative protein levels were normalized against loading controls.
In case of the coimmunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitation
efﬁciency and inputs were both taken into consideration to
determine the relative coimmunoprecipitation efﬁciency.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI REAGENT RT
(Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Total RNA (2 mg per sample)
was converted to cDNA using anchored oligo (dT) primers
(RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit; Thermo Scientiﬁc)
following the manufacturer's instructions. Individual reverse
transcription (RT) reactions of 20 mL were then diluted to 200
mL with sterile H2O. Ten microliter of diluted RT reaction was
used for real-time qPCR using the iTaq SYBR Green Supermix
with ROX (Bio-Rad). The sequences of primers used in realtime qPCR reactions were as follows: 50 -GGGCCTTGAGGAAGGATTGG-30 (HdmX forward) and 50 -TTATGCTATAAAAACCTTAA-30 (HdmX, reverse); 50 -CCTGTCACTGTCTTGTACC-30 (p21 forward) and 50 -GGTAGAAATCTGTCATGCT30 (p21 reverse); 50 -ATGCCTGCCTCACCTTCATC-30 (PUMA
forward) and 50 -TCACACGTCGCT CTCTCTAAACC-30 (PUMA
reverse); 50 -GGTCGACCTAAAAATGGTTGCA-30 (Hdm2 forward) and 50 -GGGCAGGGCTTATTCCTTTTC-30 (Hdm2
Reverse). GAPDH was used as an internal control using the
primer pair provided in the RevertAid cDNA Synthesis Kit.
Triplicate qPCR reactions were performed for each of the
samples. The real-time qPCR condition is 95 C for 3 minutes
as a predenature step, followed by 40 cycles at 95 C for 15
seconds and 60 C for 45 seconds in thin-wall 96-well PCR
plates. The data were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems
7300 Real Time PCR System and normalized to GAPDH.

Anticancer drug FL118 activates the p53 signaling
pathway
To determine whether the p53 pathway is involved in the
antitumor activity of FL118, we examined the effects of FL118
on cell growth and death with HCT116 and HCT116-p53/
colorectal cancer cells in parallel. To our surprise, we found
that FL118 induced 10% to 20% more growth inhibition across
a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 1A) and approximately 2fold more cell death (Fig. 1B) in HCT116-p53/ cells than in
wild-type (WT) p53–bearing parental HCT116 cells. Although
this is consistent with our previous report that FL118

Figure 2. FL118 inhibits p53 ubiquitination but promotes proteasomal degradation of HdmX. A, FL118 inhibits p53 polyubiquitination in cells. HCT8 cells were
treated with and without 10 and 100 nmol/L FL118 for 24 hours followed by 4-hour treatment with 25 mmol/L MG132. SDS-denatured cell lysates were used for
in vivo ubiquitination assays by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-ubiquitin antibody followed by immunoblotting (IB) for p53 (left). Equal antiubiquitinin immunoprecipitation was monitored by reprobing the membrane with anti-ubiquitin antibody (right bottom plot). Equal protein input for
/
immunoprecipitation was conﬁrmed (top right plot). B, FL118 inhibits multimonoubiquitination of p53. HCT116 and HCT116-p53
cells were treated with or
without 25 mmol/L MG132 in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L FL118 for 8 hours followed by direct Western blotting of p53 (top) or the cells were
transfected with an His-tag ubiquitin expressing plasmid and treated with or without 25 mmol/L MG132 in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L FL118 for
8 hours followed by His-tag pulldown assay coupled with Western blotting of p53. Multimonoubiquitinated p53 bands are indicated (monoUb-p53). C,
Western blot analysis of the effects of FL118 at different concentrations on HdmX and Hdm2 protein levels is shown. HCT8 cells were treated with FL118 at
10 and 100 nmol/L for 24 hours (left) or treated at 100 nmol/L for a time course (right) followed by Western blotting of HdmX and Hdm2 proteins. D, effects
of FL118 on transcription of HdmX, Hdm2, p21, and PUMA were analyzed using real-time qPCR. RNA samples were prepared from FL118-treated for 8 hours
and untreated HCT8 cells. E, rescues of HdmX degradation by proteasome inhibitor MG132 are shown. HCT8 cells were treated with FL118 at the
indicated concentrations for 24 hours and with 25 mmol/L MG132 for 4 hours followed by Western blotting of HdmX. Actin was used as the internal control.
F, FL118 effects on Hdm2–p53 and Hdm2–HdmX interaction are shown. HCT116 cells treated with 25 mmol/L MG132 (4 hours) in the presence or
absence of 10 nmol/L FL118 (8 hours) followed by coimmunoprecipitation of Hdm2–p53 and Hdm2–HdmX with anti-Hdm2 antibody and Western blotting of
p53, Hdm2, and HdmX, respectively. Band intensity ratios were obtained by IMAGEJ software analysis normalized on nontreated control, and binding ratios
were obtained by normalization of intensity ratio on that of inputs.

antitumor effect is p53 independent (8), this observation
suggests that p53 status indeed contributes to FL118 drug
response. We then examined whether FL118 indeed activates
the p53 pathway after FL118 treatment. As shown in Fig. 1C and
D, p53 accumulation was induced by as low as 10 nmol/L FL118
treatment in WT p53–bearing HCT116 and HCT8 cells. Time

induced evident p53 accumulation as short as 4 hours after
treatment and reaching a peak after 24-hour treatment and
sustained at least for 48 hours (Fig. 1D, left). Consistent with
both p21 and PUMA being transcriptionally upregulated by p53
activation, p21 and PUMA were induced in these WT p53 cell

lines by FL118 but not in p53-null HCT116 (Fig. 1C and D).
Interestingly, although p21 is induced in a FL118 concentration- and time-dependent manner, PUMA is induced by FL118
in time-dependent manner but better induced by low concentration (10 nmol/L) than high concentration (100 nmol/L) of
FL118.
To identify the mechanisms underlying p53 activation by
FL118, we asked whether FL118 inhibits p53 ubiquitination
since p53 is degraded by ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (36).
As shown in Fig. 2A, FL118 treatment for 8 hours in the
presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (to block proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins) signiﬁcantly
reduced polyubiquitination of endogenous p53 in HCT8 cells
(Fig. 2A, left, pub-p53), accompanied with evident reduction in
multimonoubiquitinated p53 (Fig. 2A, left, mub-p53). Equal
immunoprecipitation efﬁciency was conﬁrmed among the
samples by reprobing polyubiquitin (Fig. 2A, right, low part,
polyub), and equal amounts of p53 protein inputs after MG132
treatment were also conﬁrmed (Fig. 2A, right, top part). To
conﬁrm whether p53 multimonoubiquitination is also signiﬁcantly affected by FL118 treatment, a plasmid expressing
His-tagged ubiquitin was transfected into HCT116 and
HCT116-p53/ cells followed by His-tag pulldown experiment under denaturing conditions in an in vivo p53 ubiquitination assay. Our results indicated that 10 nmol/L FL118
treatment for 8 hours signiﬁcantly inhibited multimonoubiquitination of p53 detected either by direct p53 blotting
(Fig. 2B, top) or by His-ubiquitin pulldown experiment (Fig.
2B, bottom). These results allow us to conclude that FL118
treatment inhibits p53 ubiquitination.
FL118 downregulates MdmX, which involves MdmX
protein degradation
MdmX stimulates Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (38)
and is required for p53 polyubiquitination and degradation in
our previous report (36). Therefore, we asked whether FL118
inhibits Mdm2–MdmX activity by ﬁrst testing the effects
of FL118 on Mdm2 and MdmX protein levels in cells. As
shown in Fig. 2C, left plot, FL118 treatment induced expression
of human Mdm2 (Hdm2) protein but inhibited expression of
human MdmX (HdmX) protein after treatment at 10 nmol/L
and 100 nmol/L for 24 hours. Results from time course experiment indicated that HdmX downregulation by FL118 is a rapid
event occurring within as short as 4 hours after FL118 treatment (Fig. 2C, right), a time point coincident with evident p53
accumulation induced by FL118 (Fig. 1D). Consistent with
Mdm2 being a downstream target gene of p53, Mdm2 induction became evident at 4 hours and was nearly peaked at 8
hours after FL118 treatment (Fig. 2C, right), which follows
similar kinetics of p53 accumulation (Fig. 1D). Therefore, loss
of MdmX is responsible for FL118 to inactivate Mdm2–MdmX
E3 activity. Our results from real-time qPCR indicated that
FL118 treatment for 8 hours did not signiﬁcantly alter the
mRNA levels of HdmX (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the treatment
signiﬁcantly increased the p21, Hdm2, and PUMA mRNA levels
(Fig. 2D), indicating that downregulation of HdmX protein
levels by FL118 is a posttranscriptional event and FL118induced p53 is transcriptionally active. Importantly, the pres-

www.aacrjournals.org

ence of MG132 rescued HdmX downregulation by FL118 (Fig.
2E), indicating that FL118 promotes a proteasomal degradation of HdmX. To determine whether FL118 treatment affects
Hdm2–p53 and Hdm2–HdmX physical interaction, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments after treating
cells with 10 nmol/L FL118 in the presence of MG132 to block
p53 and MdmX degradation. After normalizing against inputs
and immunoprecipitation efﬁciency, our results indicated that
Hdm2–p53 interaction has a slight decrease to 90% of nontreated control, whereas the Hdm2–HdmX interaction was
moderately increased to 145% by FL118 treatment compared
with nontreated control (Fig. 2F).
FL118-induced MdmX protein degradation is
independent of ATM, p53, and p21 status, but requires
Hdm2
To understand the role of several components of the p53
signaling pathway in accelerated HdmX protein degradation
by FL118, we performed experiments using HCT116 cells with
p53-null or p21-null status. Our results show that FL118induced HdmX degradation was not affected by p53 or p21
status (Fig. 3A). Moreover, inhibition of ATM with KU55933
only slightly rescued the FL118-induced HdmX degradation or
p53 accumulation (Fig. 3B, compare lane 2, 0.45-fold HdmX,
with lane 3, 0.53-fold HdmX). In contrast, the ATM inhibitor
KU55933 completely rescued HdmX downregulation by neocarzinostatin, a radiation-mimicking agent, indicating the
ATM inhibitor worked (Fig. 3B, compare lane 4, 0.71-fold
HdmX, with lane 5, 1.02-fold HdmX) and neocarzinostatininduced HdmX downregulation is strictly ATM-dependent.
These results indicate that FL118-induced HdmX degradation
is largely independent of ATM-mediated DNA damage signaling pathway. However, a minor rescue of HdmX degradation by
ATM inhibitor was observed and suggests that ATM makes a
minor contribution to this process. HdmX degradation is
mediated by Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination after DNA damage (42, 43). To understand whether FL118-induced HdmX
degradation is also mediated by Hdm2, we performed experiments of siRNA knockdown of Hdm2 in HCT-8 cells. Our
results indicated that knockdown of Hdm2 at least partially
rescued FL118-induced HdmX degradation even though Hdm2
was not completely knocked down (Fig. 3C), suggesting that
Hdm2 plays an important role in HdmX downregulation by
FL118. To unambiguously address Hdm2 involvement, we used
p53/mdm2/mdmx TKO MEFs, and found that Hdm2 is
required for FL118-induced HdmX degradation in HdmXcotransfected TKO cells, because the absence of Hdm2 totally
abolished the effect of FL118 on HdmX degradation (Fig. 3D).
To verify that Hdm2 is also required for FL118-induced HdmX
degradation in colon cancer cells, we used HCT116 cells and
explored the dominant negative effects of enzyme-dead
Hdm2L468A mutant. Hdm2L468A is an E2-binding mutant
but intact in RING–RING interaction with HdmX as demonstrated in our previous studies (36). Our results indicated that
Hdm2L468A overexpression prevented HdmX degradation by
FL118 treatment at multiple concentrations in HCT116 cells
(Fig. 3E). These results allow us to conclude that FL118 induces
Hdm2-dependent HdmX degradation.

Figure 3. Role of p53, p21, ATM, and Hdm2 on FL118-induced HdmX degradation. A, Western blot analysis of the effects of p21 and p53 on FL118-induced
HdmX degradation. HCT116-p21–null or HCT116-p53–null cells were treated with FL118 at 10 and 100 nmol/L for 24 hours followed by Western blot analysis
for p53, Hdm2, and HdmX. B, Western blot analysis of the effects of inhibition of ATM on the FL118-induced HdmX degradation. HCT8 cells were treated for 8
hours with FL118 (100 nmol/L) or neocarzinostatin (NCS, 40 mmol/L) in the presence or absence of ATM inhibitor KU55933 (KU, 10 mmol/L) followed by
Western blotting for p53 and HdmX proteins. C, Western blot analysis of the effects of Hdm2 knockdown on the FL118-induced HdmX degradation. HCT8
cells were transfected with control siRNA (SiC) or siRNA for Hdm2 (SiHdm2) followed by 100 nmol/L FL118 treatment for 24 hours, then by Western
blotting for HdmX and Hdm2 proteins. D, HdmX downregulation by FL118 requires presence of Hdm2. TKO MEFs were transfected with HA-HdmX
(200 ng/6-cm plate) together with or without Hdm2 (200 ng/6-cm plate). Twenty hours later, cells were treated with FL118 at 10 and 100 nmol/L for 8 hours
followed by Western blotting for Hdm2 and HA-HdmX proteins. E, effects of enzyme-dead Hdm2L468A on FL118-induced degradation of endogenous HdmX.
HCT116 cells were transfected with an empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-Hdm2L468A expressing plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated
with indicated concentrations of FL118 followed by Western blotting of HdmX, Hdm2, and actin. Actin, tubulin, and GFP in A, B, C, D, and E were used as
internal controls. F, FL118 effects on p53 ubiquitination in vitro. p53 (100 nmol/L), 200 nmol/L Hdm2, and FLAG-HdmX were included in an in vitro
ubiquitination reaction in the presence of indicated concentrations of FL118 or DMSO followed by Western blotting for p53. The ubiquitinated p53 (Ub-p53)
bands are indicated. G, FL118 effects on HdmX ubiquitination in vitro were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with polyubiquitin antibody followed by Western
blotting for FLAG (IP: polyub, IB: FLAG, top) or by direct Western blotting for FLAG-HdmX (IB: FLAG, bottom) using the same reaction conditions.

FL118 inhibits p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2–MdmX but
promotes Mdm2-mediated MdmX ubiquitination
To assess whether FL118 has direct effects on Mdm2–MdmX
E3 complex and thus changes the biochemical property of the
E3 complexes toward p53 ubiquitination, we performed in vitro
p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2–MdmX using recombinant proteins in the presence or absence of FL118. This system allows us
to exclude the effects of signaling events and other proteins on
the Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex. We found that FL118 moderately inhibits p53 polyubiquitination by Mdm2–MdmX in vitro
(Fig. 3F). In contrast, FL118 stimulated Hdm2-mediated HdmX
ubiquitination in a concentration-dependent manner in both
polyubiquitin pulldown experiments (Fig. 3G, left) and direct

7492

Western blotting of FLAG-HdmX (Fig. 3G, right). These results
indicate that FL118 treatment switches substrate preference of
the Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex from p53 to MdmX for ubiquitination that resulted in proteasomal degradation of MdmX
and, consequently, leading to p53 accumulation.
MdmX levels modulate FL118 sensitivity of HCT116 cells
Our results indicate that p53-null status makes colon cancer
cells more sensitive to FL118 (Fig. 1A and B). Because MdmX
negatively regulates the p53 pathway, we hypothesized that
overexpression of HdmX would nullify the p53 function, thus
sensitizing colon cancer cells to FL118. To test this hypothesis,
we performed experiments with overexpression of HdmX in

respectively, with statistical signiﬁcance of P < 0.03; Fig. 4C).
These results suggest that HdmX levels can modify FL118induced cell killing via its effect on the p53 pathway.

Figure 4. Role of HdmX in FL118-induced growth inhibition. A, HdmX
overexpression increases FL118-induced cell growth inhibition. HCT116
cells were transfected with either an empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1HdmX expressing plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with
indicated concentrations of FL118 for 72 hours followed by MTT proliferation
assays. B, HdmX overexpression attenuates p53 and p21 induction by
FL118. HCT116 cells were transfected as in A followed by FL118 treatment
at indicated concentrations for 8 hours and Western blotting of HdmX,
Hdm2, p53, p21, and tubulin as shown. C, HdmX overexpression increases
FL118-induced cell death. HCT116 cells were transfected as in A.
Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with FL118 at indicated

was shown as sub-G1 fractions. P values between groups of vector and

inhibited cell growth signiﬁcantly better in HdmX-overexpressing HCT116 cells than vector-transfected HCT116 cells (Fig.

induction of p21 and Hdm2 by FL118 as compared with vector
control (Fig. 4B). Sub-G1 analysis indicated that the attenuated
p53 response by HdmX overexpression is associated with

FL118-induced p53 activation leads to senescence
response in WT p53–bearing colon cancer cells
Previous studies reported that HdmX overexpression inhibits oncogene-induced senescence program (44). We asked
whether MdmX elimination by FL118 induces p53-dependent
senescence. We tested this idea in HCT8 cells with or without
knockdown of p53 in a clonogenic assay for the effects of p53
status on long-term cell proliferation. Knockdown efﬁciency
for p53 by shp53-lentiviral infection (shp53) was nearly complete as shown by Western blot analysis as compared with cells
infected with empty lentiviral vector (shC; Fig. 5D, inset). To
our surprise, knockdown of p53 alone did not alter the plating
efﬁciency or clonogenic potential in nontreated HCT8 cells
(Fig. 5A, compare shC with shp53). In contrast, FL118 treatment at very low doses (0.15 and 0.3 nmol/L) signiﬁcantly
reduced the numbers of colony-forming cells (colony is deﬁned
as >50 cells/colony after a 3-day FL118 treatment followed by a
14-day culture in drug-free medium; Fig. 5B, only 0.3 nmol/L
results are shown). The anticlonogenic effect of FL118 at very
low doses (<0.3 nmol/L) is independent of p53 status, because
there was no signiﬁcant difference in the colony numbers
between control (shC) and p53 knockdown (shp53) groups
(Fig. 5B and D). In contrast and impressively, FL118 at doses of
10 nmol/L (10, 20, and 100 nmol/L) resulted in eradication of
colonies (>50 cells per colony) in both shC and shp53 groups;
however, the shC group left a lot of small colonies (<50 cells per
colony; Fig. 5C). In other words, two distinct phenotypes were
observed in this experiment: shp53 HCT8 cells are nearly clear
of viable cells, whereas some shC HCT8 cells remained alive as
tiny colonies (5 to 20 cells/colony; Fig. 5C, only 10 nmol/L
results are shown). Under microscope, cells in normal colonies
in nontreated HCT8 cells are round, stacking on each other,
and densely stained with thousands of very small cells (Fig. 5A,
nontreatment, right plot). In contrast, cells in the tiny colonies
after 10 nmol/L FL118 treatment have morphology of enlarged
ﬂat cell, adherent to the surface of plate without stacking on
each other and only lightly stained (Fig. 5C, FL118, 10 nmol/L,
right plot). These morphologies suggest that these cells gradually lost their clonogenic potential during replication, thus are
unable to form normal colonies, a phenotype reminiscent of
p53-induced senescence. As expected, results from SA-b-gal
activity staining indicated that 10 nmol/L FL118 treatment
induced approximately 92% of SA-b-gal positivity in the surviving cells (Fig. 6A, right). To conﬁrm that FL118 preferentially
induces apoptosis in the absence of p53, we compared apoptotic cleavage of PARP between HCT116 and HCT116-p53–
null cells after 48-hour FL118 treatment. Our results indicated
that 10 nmol/L FL118 induced signiﬁcant PARP cleavage in
HCT116-p53–null cells but not in HCT116 cells (Fig. 6B, left).
PARP cleavage in HCT116 cells was only detected with a high
concentration of FL118 at 100 nmol/L. To gain insight into
differential apoptotic response among WT p53 colorectal

cancer cell lines, we compared HCT8 with HCT116 cells. Our
results indicated that HCT8 cells are more sensitive than
HCT116 cells in FL118-induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 6B, right,
compare 10 nmol/L FL118 treatment). Because p21 protects
p53-dependent apoptosis (28), we tested whether absence of
p21 will give a phenotype similar to that of HCT116-p53–null
cells. Our results indicated that indeed, loss of p21 sensitizes
HCT116 to FL118 for induction of sub-G1 population (Fig. 6C,
top) and apoptotic cleavage of PARP (Fig. 6C, bottom), similar
to HCT116-p53–null cells (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that
the long-term effect of FL118 treatment triggers p53/p21dependent senescence program in nonapoptotic cells, but it
triggers apoptosis independent of p53, because the cells with
senescent morphology disappeared in p53-null-HCT8 cells
(Fig. 5C).

Discussion
FL118 structurally is an analogue of irinotecan (pro-drug of
SN-38) and topotecan, two FDA-approved camptothecin analogues for cancer treatment in clinical practice. Evidence
suggests that FL118 may have novel MOAs distinct from other
camptothecin analogues. Camptothecin was reported to activate p53 with serine 20 phosphorylation, indicating ATM activation in colon cancer cells, including RKO cells (16, 45, 46).
Interestingly, camptothecin treatment does not induce p53dependent transactivation of Mdm2 gene (16), which is opposite to the effect of FL118-induced p53-dependent Mdm2
expression (Figs. 2C and 3A, C, and E). These observations
suggest that FL118 activates p53 via alternative mechanisms
different from that used by other camptothecin analogues. We
demonstrated here that FL118-induced p53 activation is

largely ATM independent (Fig. 3B). This is distinct from
irinotecan and topotecan, which induce ATM activation
(47), and ATM is involved in repair of topotecan-induced
double-strand breaks (48). FL118, rather, induces proteasomal
degradation of HdmX as an underlying mechanism for p53
activation. These ﬁndings have two important implications.
First, this further supports the notion that MdmX depletion is a
critical mechanism to inactivate oncogenic Mdm2–MdmX E3
complex and accordingly activates p53 signaling in cells (39),
because MdmX stimulates Mdm2-mediated p53 monoubiquitination and is required for p53 polyubiquitination (36, 38).
Second, FL118 can be used as an MdmX-depleting agent in
MdmX-targeting therapies for a subgroup of patients with
cancer (i.e., a type of personalized medicine) such as in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (49) and melanomas (50), in which
MdmX overexpression confers treatment resistance. Our studies provided evidence that FL118 inhibits growth of MdmXoverexpressing cells better than non–MdmX-overexpressing
cells (Fig. 4), probably because it nulliﬁes p53-dependent

senescence and the cells switch to apoptotic response to
FL118. Currently, how FL118 changes the biochemical properties of Mdm2–MdmX E3 complex remains an open question,
even though it can be partially explained by FL118 slightly
decreasing Hdm2–p53 interaction and moderately increasing
Hdm2–HdmX interaction (Fig. 2F). It remains to be determined whether FL118 directly binds to Mdm2 or MdmX or to
E2 enzymes that alter the ubiquitination reaction, or FL118
binds to other Mdm2/MdmX complex–associated proteins for
its effects in cells.
Another question is how FL118-induced activation of p53
signaling pathway contributes to the antitumor effects of
FL118. Our studies in this report from multiple cancer cell
lines of different p53 status demonstrated that FL118 induces
p53-independent apoptosis and p53/p21-dependent senescence, both contribute to the inhibition of clonogenic growth
of colon cancer cells by FL118 (Figs. 5 and 6). Importantly,
without WT p53, FL118 more effectively induces cancer cell
apoptosis. Given the fact that many types of later-stage cancers

frequently lose functional p53, the double antitumor mechanisms of FL118 (p53-independent apoptosis and p53/p21dependent senescence) support potential application of FL118
for both early- and later-stage cancers. In short, this newly
identiﬁed MOA of FL118 constitutes a novel component of the
FL118 antitumor mechanisms. Of note, regarding p53-dependent p21 induction in WT p53 cells, the conclusions drawn
from this study are inconsistent with our previous report (8).
We would like to clarify this here. This inconsistency was due to
the use of different p21 promoter sequences in our previous
reporter assays: In our previous report, we used p21 core
promoter-driven (234 bp long from 208  þ26) luciferase
reporter construct, which does not contain p53 binding sites
(distal site: 2313  2212 as one p53 binding site and
proximal site: 1452  1310 as the other site; ref. 9), whereas
in this study, we used qPCR to directly measure the p21
transcripts. Because of the use of the p53-binding sites
negative p21 core promoter as one of the four negative
controls plus a poor p21 Western blot, the p53-dependent
p21 induction by FL118 was overlooked in the previous
report, in which the inhibitory effects of FL118 on antiapoptotic gene promoters were a focus.
Another point we would like to mention here is that
although we observed massive senescence in surviving WT
p53 HCT8 cells after FL118 treatment (Fig. 6A, right), it is
noteworthy that the extent of FL118-induced senescence and
apoptosis programs may vary among WT p53–bearing colorectal cancer cell lines as shown by the difference of FL118induced PARP cleavage between HCT8 and HCT116 cells (Fig.
6B, 10 nmol/L FL118). Nevertheless, our results suggest that
both senescence and apoptosis contribute to elimination of
clonogenic potentials of cancer cells (Fig. 5). As summarized in
our proposed model (Fig. 6D), FL118 treatment of WT p53–
bearing cancer cells induces p53-independent apoptosis by
downregulating antiapoptotic genes such as survivin, XIAP,
cIAP2, and Mcl-1, and p53-dependent apoptosis via PUMA
induction. However, the surviving cells also undergo p53/p21dependent senescence, which inhibits the apoptotic pathway.
This is consistent with a role of p53-dependent senescence in
tumor suppression and treatment outcomes (23, 26). In contrast, FL118 treatment of p53-null colon cancer cells exclusively induces p53-independent apoptosis due to lack of choice
for p53-dependent senescence. The collective effects of FL118
in induction of both apoptosis and senescence inhibit clonogenic potentials of both WT p53 and p53-null colon cancer
cells. Moreover, when WT p53 function is inhibited by alternative mechanisms such as HdmX overexpression, FL118
appears to kill these cells better (Fig. 4). Therefore, FL118
exerts a targeted and better cytotoxicity in cancer cells with
either p53 deletion or with WT p53 plus HdmX overexpression.
Given the fact that normal cells possess WT p53 function,
FL118-induced p53 activation might be one of the possible
explanations for the favorable toxicology proﬁle of FL118:
highly toxic to cancer cells but low toxicity to the normal
organs of animals, i.e., p53 activation in normal cells by FL118
may result in temporary G1 arrest that protects cells from
FL118 insult, whereas p53 activation by FL118 in cancer cells
results in senescence and apoptotic cell death.

Cancer Res; 74(24) December 15, 2014

On the basis of the current studies of FL118, apoptosis
induction by FL118 is largely mediated by its inhibition of
antiapoptotic protein expression, including survivin, Mcl-1,
XIAP, and cIAP2 (8). The mechanism of this inhibition occurs
at least partially at transcriptional level for survivin promoter,
and likely so for Mcl-1, XIAP, and cIAP2 promoters as well,
because the 2-kb promoter region of these genes upstream of
the transcriptional start site(s) shows similar transcription
factor–binding patterns but highly different from the p21 core
promoter and the dhfr (dihydrofolate reductase) promoter (9).
Certainly, FL118 may also suppress the expression of antiapoptotic proteins via posttranscriptional mechanisms, which
is one of the research areas under investigation. Inhibition of
antiapoptotic proteins empowers FL118 to eliminate the antiapoptotic activities resulted from upregulation of these proteins, a common event in many types of cancer (5). As a result,
this may partially explain the p53-independent apoptosis
induction by FL118 in general (8).
In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that FL118 is
capable of activating p53-dependent senescence program via
a unique MOA in WT p53 cancer cells that bypassed apoptosis.
Together with our previous studies, FL118 inhibits multiple
oncotargets including antiapoptotic proteins and MdmX for
cancer cell elimination. These ﬁndings extend the uniqueness
of FL118 as a superior anticancer drug and support its further
development toward clinical application.
