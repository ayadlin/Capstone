ABSTRACT
In this study, we tried to explore if xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
group-A (XPA) expression is likely a prognostic prediction factor for locally
advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with platinumbased chemoradiotherapy, which was considered to bring chemotherapy-related
severe toxicity compared with radiotherapy alone. Firstly, MTT assay revealed
that downregulating XPA expression in NPC HONE1 and CNE1 cells decreased
IC50 of cisplatin and sensitized cells to cisplatin. XPA expression was detected by
immunohistochemistry in cancer tissues from locally advanced NPC patients treated
with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. The relationships between XPA expression
and clinicopathologic features, overall survival and progression-free survival of
patients were evaluated. The results showed that XPA expression was not associated
with clinicopathologic parameters, but was likely an independent prognostic factor
for patient survival. High XPA level predicts a poor prognosis, and the prediction
values were higher in subgroups of younger, higher EBV antibody titer, or treated
with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Combining XPA levels and T/N classifications,
we successfully classified these patients into low, medium and high risk groups for
platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. These findings suggest that XPA levels may
be a potential predictor of prognosis in locally advanced NPC patients treated with
platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, and helpful for selecting patients likely to need
and benefit from this treatment in future.

BACKGROUND

overall survival benefits were achieved in cisplatinbased concurrent chemoradiotherapy comparing with
radiotherapy alone, whereas treatment-related death and
severe acute toxicity obviously increased [5, 6]. Therefore,
for better clinical outcome with less toxicity, it is very
necessary to identify molecular markers which could
predict the resistance of platinum-based chemotherapy.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a high
incidence in southern China [1, 2]. Platinum-based
concurrent chemoradiotherapy is one of the standard
treatment approaches for locally advanced NPC [3, 4].
However, meta analyses suggested that only 6% 5-year

In previous studies, we found that eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) confer to cispaltin
sensitivity via downregulating the synthesis of nucleotide
excision repair (NER) proteins, such as xeroderma
pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA) and C
(XPC), in NPC cell lines [7]. The overexpression of
NER proteins theoretically promotes the activity of
nucleotide excision repair, and consequently confers
platinum resistance [8, 9]. Disappointedly, accumulating
studies reveal discrepant results [10]. XPA has been
reported to correlate with cisplatin cisplatin resistance
in lung cancer cell lines [11, 12]. Down-regulating XPA
expression or expressing a competitive, nonfunctional
truncated XPA decreases the platinum resistance in lung
cancer and prostate cancer DU15 cell lines, but not in
prostate cancer PC3 cells [12-15]. Another reporter shows
that overexpressing XPA does not increase the paltinum
resistance in testis cancer 833K cells [16]. Several clinical
researches have demonstrated that the expression of XPA
proteins predicts improved outcome and good prognosis
in ovarian carcinoma [17, 18] or no correlation with the
response to cisplatin and overall survival in testicular germ
cell tumors [19]. The role of XPA in response to cisplatin
in NPC cell lines and NPC patients is not clear. In this
study, we found that downregulating XPA sensitized

NPC cells to cisplatin, and high expression of XPA was
associated with poor prognosis in NPC patients treated
with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.

RESULTS
XPA contributes to cisplatin resistance in NPC
cell lines
To verify whether XPA is a cisplatin resistance
factor in NPC cells, we firstly tested the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin by MTT
assay after knocking down XPA expression in NPC cell
line HONE1 and CNE1 cells, or overexpressing XPA in
CNE1 and CNE2 cells. AS shown in Figure 1A and 1B
(inner), XPA is successfully knocked down by two siRNA
oligonucleotides. Compared to cells transfected with
negative control (NC) siRNA, all cells with reduced XPA
expression are less resistant to cisplatin, the IC50 decreased
41.0% (XPA-si1) and 32.8% (XPA-si2) in HONE1 cells
, and 49.8% (XPA-si1) and 34.6% (XPA-si2) in CNE1
cells respectively (Figure 1C); Consequently, the relative
resistance factor (RRF) to cisplatin also decreased 40.9%

50.4% (XPA-si1) and 34.5% (XPA-si2) in CNE1 cells
respectively (Figure 1D). In turn, the IC50 and RRF
slightly increased in CNE1 cells (p < 0.05) and CNE2
cells (no significant) after ectopic XPA overexpression
(Supplemental Figure S1). These results suggest XPA
likely correlates with cisplatin resistance in NPC cell lines.
Since NER pathway consists of at least other five factors
except XPA, we speculate that the effect of XPA on NER
activity may also be restricted by other factors, especially
while overexpressing.

expression was detected in almost all samples (128/129),
and high (H score ≥ 1.4) in 57.4% samples (Table 1).

XPA expression was not associated with the
clinicopathologic parameters
The relationships of XPA expression and the
clinicopathologic parameters of NPC patients were
analyzed by two-tailed χ2 test. The results showed that
there were no significant correlations between XPA
expression and all of the clinicopathologic parameters
that we assessed, including gender, age (≤50, >50), T
classification (T1-2, T3-4), N classification (N0-1, N2-3),
clinical stage, histological type, VCA-IgA titer (≤1:160,
>1:160), EA-IgA titer (≤1:20, >1:20) and treatment
strategy (induction chemotherapy plus radiotherapy,
concurrent chemoradiotherapy only/plus induction
chemotherapy) (Table 2).

Expression of XPA in NPC samples
Since XPA may correlates with cisplatin resistance
in NPC cell lines, we wonder whether XPA level serves
as a cisplatin resistance factor in NPC patients. So, we
chose 129 newly diagnosed locally advanced NPC patients
treated with radiotherapy plus induction chemotherapy or/
and concurrent chemotherapy containing platinum-based
regimens (at least 2 chemotherapy cycles) (Table 1), and
tested XPA expression by immuohistochemistry (IHC) in
biopsy tumor samples of these patients. Representative
IHC images and the grades for XPA staining are shown
in Figure 2A. XPA protein was localized in both nuclei
and cytoplasm, but mainly in nuclei. XPA expression was
observed high in lymphocyte and weak in nasopharyngeal
epithelial cells (Figure 2A). As to tumor cells, XPA

Survival analysis indicates that XPA expression is
an independent prognostic factor
To investigate whether XPA expression serves
as a prognostic marker in NPC patients treated with
chemoradiotherapy containing platinum-based regimens,
we performed univariate and multivariable Cox regression
analysis. All variables were included (Table 2), except

and XPA expression (HR 2.44; 95%CI 1.30-4.60; p =

(OS), while only XPA expression (HR 1.97; 95%CI
1.08-3.61; p = 0.025) were significantly correlated with
progression-free survival (PFS) (Supplemental Table

S1). There were no significant correlations between
survival and other parameters including gender, age, N
classification, and treatment strategy. These results may
due to a small sample pool.
However, multivariable analysis suggested XPA

expression together with T and N classification were
independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS (Table 3).
Patients with T3-4 classification had significantly lower 5year survival rates than those with T1-2 classification (OS,
67.7% vs. 83.3%; PFS, 65.7% vs. 76.7%); and 5-year
survival rates were significantly lower in patients with
N2-3 classification than those with N0-1 classification (OS,
64.6% vs. 78.1%; PFS, 58.5% vs. 78.1%). Kaplan-Meier
analysis and log-rank test also indicated that high XPA
level correlated significantly with poor OS and PFS, the
cumulative 5-year survival rates were markedly lower in
the high XPA group than those in the low XPA group (OS,
64.9% vs. 80.0%; PFS, 63.5% vs. 74.5%) (Figure 2B, 2C).

prediction (OS and PFS) of patient subgroups stratified by
gender, age, T classification, N classification, VCA-IgA,
EA-IgA and treatment strategy. The results demonstrated
that XPA expression possessed more prediction value
on OS and PFS in the subgroups of younger patients
(age≤50), VCA-IgA>1:160, EA-IgA>1:20, or treated
with concurrent chemoradiotherapy only or plus induction
chemotherapy. XPA expression also showed significant
prognostic value (p < 0.05) in the subgroups of male, T1-2
classification and two N classifications (N0-1 and N2-3) for
OS, in the ones of male and N0-1 classification for PFS
(Figures 3 and 4, Supplemental Figures S2 and S3).

Recursive partitioning analysis of survival

Subgroup survival analysis

We investigated whether clinical stages, which
combined T and N classifications together, affect the
overall survival in this population of NPC patients, but

We also performed subgroup survival analysis
to evaluate the value of XPA expression on prognostic

the result was strange because no difference for OS
between the patients at stage III and the ones at stage
IVa/b (Supplemental Figure S4A). We wonder if one or
several small populations in stage III patients had poor
prognosis while others had good one. So we splitted stage
III into two subgroups (IIIA, T1-2N2M0 or T3N0M0; IIIB:
T3N1-2M0) (Figure 5A). Survival analysis revealed that
there was significant difference for OS and PFS between
IIIA and IIIB subgroups (Supplemental Figure S4B, S4C).
The survival curve of stage IIIA patients was similar to the
one of stage II, while that of stage IIIB was near to that of
stage IVa/b (Supplemental Figure S4D). So we combined
the stage IIIA and II to lower TN stage group, the stage
IIIB and IVa/b to higher TN stage group (Figure 5A). We
found great differences on OS and PFS between these two
groups (Supplemental Figure S4E, S4F). Then, recursive
partitioning analysis was performed to construct a decision
tree for OS and PFS, using the significant independent
prognostic factors including TN stage (lower/higher)
and XPA expression. The results showed patients were
classified into low, medium and high risk groups (Figure
5A), with 5-year OS (PFS) rates of 94.1% (88.2%), 77.2%
(71.9%) and 58.2% (58.2%) respectively. Significant
differences in survival were observed between the three
groups, and the high risk group had significantly poorer
prognosis compared to low and medium risk groups for
OS and PFS (p < 0.01) (Figure 5B, 5C).

damaged helical DNA strands and acts as a damage verifier
[8]. So far, several studies have elucidated NER factors
contribute to cisplatin resistance and hamper the effect of
cisplatin-based treatment [30-33]. The NER factor XPC
expression was reported to increase cisplatin resistance
in lung adenocarcinoma cells and predict poor prognosis
[30]. Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 is
thought to confer cisplatin resistance in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells and correlate
with poor prognosis in HNSCC and locoregionally
advanced NPC patients who receiving cispatin-based
chemotherapy [31-33].
Although the critical role of XPA in NER and the
important role of NER in cisplatin resistance have been
accepted [8, 9], the relationship of XPA expression to
cisplatin resistance and clinical prognosis of patients
treated with platinum-based chemotherapy is still
controversial according to previous reports [10-19]. A
common XPA gene single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP), -4G/A in the fourth nucleotide before start codon,
has been illuminated to be associated with susceptibility
risk of lung cancer in Asian ethnicity [34], and has a
significantly increased risk of progression and death in
non-small cell lung cancer patients after radiotherapy and
platinum-based chemotherapy [35].
Because of existing at the fourth nucleotide
before start codon, this polymorphism will not affect
protein structure and function. It is speculated that this
polymorphism might affect the mRNA tertiary structure
and stability or affect the binding between translational
factors and mRNA, consequently interfere the translation
of XPA. So we detected XPA at protein level, regardless
of the polymorphism, to investigate the association of
XPA and cisplatin resistance and clinical prognosis. In
this study, we found that down-regulating XPA expression
increased the cisplatin sensitivity in cultured NPC cells
(Figure 1), so XPA is likely a cisplatin resistance factor.
The investigation on clinical samples reveals that XPA
expression is an independent prognostic factor and high
XPA level is associated with poor prognosis in locally
advanced NPC patients treated with radiotherapy plus
platinum-based chemotherapy (Figure 2, Table 3). These
findings suggest XPA level can be used to predict if a
patient is likely sensitive or resistant to this treatment, and
contribute to the development of individualized treatment
regimens.
The treatment strategies included radiotherapy
plus induction chemotherapy (IC+RT), concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) only or plus induction
chemotherapy in our study. We found that the patients
could be easily classified, by XPA expression level, into
two groups with good or poor response to CCRT treatment
regimen, but not to IC+RT regimen (Figures 3A, 3E, 4A
and 4E). The phenomenon may result from the different
cycles of platinum-base chemotherapy between CCRT
treatment group and IC+RT group (4.53 cycles vs. 2.24

DISCUSSION
Cisplatin and other platinum-based antitumor drugs
have been exerted on a wide range of tumors including
testicular, head and neck, lung, ovarian, bladder cancers
[20, 21]. The major anticancer mechanism of platinumbased drugs is to form platinum-DNA adducts, a type
of DNA lesion, by binding covalently to DNA strands,
and cause a set of intracellular changes, and finally
result in cellular apoptosis [22]. Although platinum has
a miraculous initial therapeutic effect, unfortunately, it
often leads to treatment failure because of intrinsic and
extrinsic resistance to this drug. The potential mechanisms
of platinum resistance [23] include reduced intracellular
accumulation [24, 25] and increased detoxification of
cisplatin [26], increased capacity of DNA damage repair
[7, 9], inactivation of the apoptotic pathways [27] and other
epigenetic alterations at molecular and cellular levels [28,
29]. Among of them, increased capacity of DNA damage
repair, especially the nucleotide excision repair (NER), is
proposed to be one of the most crucial determinants [9].
NER is a highly versatile and complicated pathway which
could eliminate numerous types of DNA damage like
caused by UV light and cisplatin [8]. This repair process
could be generally divided into damage recognition,
DNA opening, damage excision, and DNA resynthesis.
It involves several factors assembling with an ordered
and stepwise manner. Among of them, XPA binds to the

cycles). Subgroup survival analysis also demonstrated
that XPA expression level had more prediction value on
OS and PFS in the subgroups of EBV VCA-IgA>1:160
or EA-IgA>1:20, though EBV antibody titer alone wasn’t
correlative with prognosis in these 129 NPC patients
(Figures 3A, 3C, 3D, 4A, 4C and 4D). Plasma EBV
DNA has currently been considered as a biomarker for
progression, relapse, and prognosis of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma [36, 37]. These evidences indicate that EBV
antibody titer might be a factor to improve the XPA-based
prediction if a patient is likely resistant to platinum-base
treatment. As to age classifications, XPA level displayed
more high value in prognostic prediction for younger
(age≤50) patients than the older ones (age>50) (Figures
3A, 3B, 4A and 4B). We assume that the confounding
variables, such as complex influences resulted from
senescence, attenuate the influence of platinum treatment
in the elder. In addition, our results also showed XPA
possess prediction value of survival in male subgroup
but not in female (Figures 3A, 4A, Supplemental Figures
S2A and S3A). This may due to a smaller population in
female subgroup (only 32 patients). Considering that the
hazard ratios of these two subgroups are very close (OS,
2.54 vs. 2.56; PFS, 2.17 vs. 1.87) (Figures 3A and 4A),
we speculate that there might be no significant difference
in prognostic prediction between male and female group.
In this study, we successfully classified locally
advanced NPC patients into low, medium and high
risk groups for the treatment regimen of radiotherapy
combined with platinum-based chemotherapy, according
to T, N classifications and XPA expression level (Figure
5). This classification may give a clue to physicians for
making individualized treatment plans, or considering if
the patients in high risk group should receive a different
treatment. Previous reports have uncovered that there are
many molecules and factors involved cispaltin resistance/
sensitivity so far [7, 9, 14, 23-29]. We previously
confirmed eIF3a confers cisplatin sensitivity via negatively
regulating NER proteins in vitro study. In this study, we
also detected eIF3a expression of NPC samples using IHC.
However, the results showed that eIF3a expression isn’t
significantly correlative with either XPA level or patients’
survival (data not shown). It seems that eIF3a expression
is not suitable for predictive factor of prognosis in these
NPC patients. For more precisely distinguishing patients,
who might be resistant or sensitive to platinum-base
treatment, more easily and accurately, we should perform
a large scale of clinical trials to develop a comprehensive
prediction model including more molecular factors and
clinical parameters. Thus we can, hopefully, relieve those
patients resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy from
severe toxicity.

Patients and tissue samples
One hundred and twenty-nine paraffin-embedded
NPC tissue samples were collected from Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center between 2002 and 2009. The
cases eligibility criteria were as follows: histologically
proven and newly diagnosed NPC without treatment
history; locally advanced and no distant metastasis; no
serious complications or other primary tumors; treated
with chemoradiotherapy containing platinum-based
regimens (at least 2 chemotherapy cycles) and regularly
followed up in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center
[38]. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Sun Yatsen University Cancer Center, and informed consent was
obtained from each patient. TNM staging was adjusted
according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (7th
edition). The median follow-up time was 76.1 months
(rang, 8.2-129.7 months). The 5-year overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 67.4% and
64.3%, respectively. Clinical information of the samples is
summarized in Table 1.

from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). M-MLV Reverse
transcription system and GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix were
from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). BCA Protein Assay
Kit was from KeyGEN Biotech (Nanjing, China). siTRAN
transfection reagent was from OriGene (Beijing, China).
Primers and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were
synthesized respectively by Invitrogen (Shanghai, China)

(1:400) overnight at 4ºC, followed by incubation with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by
peroxidase Envision Kit. Sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin.
The stained slides were evaluated independently by
two pathologists who were blinded to clinical parameters.
The staining intensity of cancer cells (excluding
noncancerous cells, especially lymphocytes) were graded
on a scale of 0 to 3 (I0, I1-3): negative staining (0), weak
staining (1), moderate staining (2), and strong staining
(3). The percentages of tumor cells in each grade (P0,
P1–3) were recorded as 5% increments from 0 to 100%
respectively. The final H scores were accumulated as
follows formula: H score = I1×P1+ I2×P2 +I3×P3. ROC
curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff value for
XPA high expression group and low expression group. The
H score that was closest to the point with both maximum
sensitivity and specificity was selected as the cutoff value
(H score = 1.40), and defined high XPA expression while
H score ≥ 1.4 and low XPA expression while H score <
1.4.

Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
(qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was conducted as described previously [7,
29]. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent.
Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed to
cDNA, sequentially subjected to qRT-PCR using primers
shown in Supplemental Table S2. The threshold cycle
(Ct) values were detected and normalized against that of
β-actin internal control. The relative mRNA levels were
calculated as the value of 2△Ct normalized to the control.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [7, 29, 40]. Briefly, cell pellets were lysed and
centrifuged to remove insoluble cell debris. The protein
concentrations in supernatants were measured using BCA
Protein Assay Kit, proteins were then separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes.
The blots were probed with anti-XPA (1:1,000) or antiGAPDH (1:2,000) antibody, followed by reaction with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Signals were
enhanced by ECL detection system and captured with
X-ray film.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed by using
SPSS software package (version 16.0). The two-tailed χ2
test was used to assess the correlation of XPA expression
with clinicopathological parameters. Kaplan-Meier and
log-rank tests were used to analyze patient survival time
and curves. Cox proportional model was used to calculate
the multivariate hazard ratios for clinicopathological
parameters and the XPA expression level with respect
to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS). The two-tailed t-test was used for comparisons
of significance of the in vitro data. P values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in a density
of 2000 cells/well and incubated for 24 h followed by
treatedcisplatin treatment for 72 h. Then cells were stained
with MTT followed by determination of OD570 nm with a
reference wavelength at 630 nm. The data were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism 5 software to obtain the IC50. The
relative resistance factor (RRF) was calculated by dividing
the IC50 value by that of control group.
