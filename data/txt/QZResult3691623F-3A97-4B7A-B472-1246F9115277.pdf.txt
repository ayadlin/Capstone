ABSTRACT
Mer is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with oncogenic properties that is often
overexpressed or activated in various malignancies. Using both immunohistochemistry
and microarray analyses, we demonstrated that Mer was overexpressed in both
tumoral and stromal compartments of about 70% of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) samples relative to surrounding normal lung tissue. This was validated in
freshly harvested NSCLC samples; however, no associations were found between Mer
expression and patient features. Although Mer overexpression did not render normal
lung epithelial cell tumorigenic in vivo, it promoted the in vitro cell proliferation,
clonogenic colony formation and migration of normal lung epithelial cells as well
as NSCLC cells primarily depending on MAPK and FAK signaling, respectively.
Importantly, Mer overexpression induced resistance to erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor)
in otherwise erlotinib-sensitive cells. Furthermore, Mer-specific inhibitor rendered
erlotinib-resistant cells sensitive to erlotinib. We conclude that Mer enhances
malignant phenotype and pharmacological inhibition of Mer overcomes resistance of
NSCLC to EGFR-targeted agents.

drive lung cancer in a substantial minority of patients
and development of many targeted therapeutics that have
significantly improved outcome in those patients. The
well-characterized molecular changes involve the driver
mutations in the genes of EGFR (~10%), ALK (5%),
KRAS (10–20%), PI3KCA (3%), BRAF (3%), ROS1 (1%),
c-MET (2%) and ERBB2 (2%) etc [3]. Therapeutic agents
targeting these molecular aberrations in cancer cells have
been effective at prolonging survival of patients [4];

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide, causing about 1·6 million deaths in
2012 where about 40% of cases occurs in China [1]. Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–85%
of lung cancer cases and its current 5-year survival rate
for all stages of disease is only 17% [2]. Last decade
has witnessed the discovery of molecular mutations that

however, for the remaining majority of patients with
NSCLC, the oncogenic drivers are complex and
identification of additional therapeutic targets has become
a major research focus [5]. To address this problem, we
have investigated the roles of Mer receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) as a novel oncogenic molecule in lung cancer.
Mer RTK belongs to the Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM)
family of RTKs [6, 7]. Abnormal activation of the TAM
receptors is implicated in the oncogenesis of a spectrum of
human cancers, including hematological malignancies and
glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer,
colon cancer, gastric cancer, pituitary adenomas, and
rhabdomyosarcomas [8]. Previous studies identified Axl
as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC, particularly
in adenocarcinoma, where Axl expression correlated with
tumor progression, malignant behavior of tumor cells, and
tumor resistance to chemo- and targeted therapies [9–13].
With regard to Mer, a recent study demonstrates that Mer
RTK is overexpressed in about 70% of NSCLC relative
to surrounding normal lung tissue where Mer functions
to enhance the proliferation of cancer cells and inhibits
their apoptosis, thereby promoting chemoresistance [5];
moreover, knockdown of Mer expression by short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) abrogated oncogenic phenotypes of tumor
cells, including decreased clonogenic growth, improved
chemosensitivity, and delayed tumor progression in animal
models [5], thus identifying it as a potential therapeutic
target in NSCLC [14].
However, the above study of Mer expression
was conducted in a relatively small cohort of NSCLC
samples [5]; though the downstream signaling pathways
of Mer activation have been dissected, further knowledge
of deeper mechanisms for Mer-mediated oncogenic
phenotypes remains needed. In addition, macrophages
have been described constitutively express Mer receptor
by which they constantly phagocytose apoptotic cells
to maintain self-tolerance in the steady state [15], and
immunosuppressive agents have been demonstrated be
able to further upregulate the expression of Mer [16].
In view of the abundant presence of tumor-associated
macrophages and immunosuppressive factors in tumors
[17], it would be interesting to explore the expression
and its clinical significance of stromal Mer in tumors.
Therefore, in the present study, we first examined the Mer
expression in both tumoral and stromal compartments
by using tissue microarrays (TMA) containing a
relatively large amount of NSCLC samples (150 cases)
and repeated the findings in freshly harvested NSCLC
samples (30 cases) by using immunohistochemistry
and western blotting, and then correlated the findings
with clinicopathological features of patients. We further
explored the biological effects of Mer expression in
lung epithelial cells and NSCLC cells by using both
overexpression and function-blocking experiments.

Mer is frequently overexpressed and activated
in NSCLC
We first evaluated expression of Mer in TMA
containing cancer tissues with matched paracancerous
tissues from 150 Chinese patients with NSCLC.
Demographic and histopathological data are presented
in Table 1. Concordant with previous reports, survival
was associated with age and stage of disease (TNM
stage and lymph node status), but not histological
subtype and differentiation degree [5, 18]. Tumor cells
exhibited membranous and cytoplasmic staining for
Mer (Fig. 1A–1H, lower panels). The staining was
specific since no staining was noted when PBS was used
instead of primary anti-Mer antibody (Supplementary
Fig. 1A). Mer expression in tumor cells (MERt) was
detected (H-score  ≥  5) in 67% of patients (Table 1)
and was generally low-to-moderate with a median
H-score of 10 (range: 0–300) while intermediate
(H-score = 101–200) and high (H-score = 201–300)
Mer expression was seen in 11% and 2% of patients
respectively. Within the tumor microenvironment, Mer
was strongly expressed in cells exhibiting macrophage
morphology, but not in blood vessels (Fig. 1A–1H,
lower panels and Supplementary Fig. 1B and 1C).
Stromal Mer expression (MERs) was observed in 73% of
patients (Table 1) and was also low-to-moderate with a
median H-score of 15 while intermediate and high Mer
expression in tumor stroma was found in 7% and 3%
of patients respectively. Normal lung epithelial tissue
adjacent to tumors was always negative ­(Fig. 1A–1H,
upper panels) while stromal cells with macrophage
morphology sometimes show positive for Mer (Fig. 1C
and 1F, upper panels), indicating up-regulated Mer
expression in both cancer cells and stromal cells. We
also found the evident correlation between tumoral
and stromal Mer expression (r = 0.4784, p < 0.0001,
Supplementary Fig. 2).
To further confirm the Mer expression, we harvested
fresh neoplastic tissues from 30 patients with NSCLC
and subjected them to analysis by IHC and western
blotting. Consistent with the results from TMA, Mer
expression was detected (H-score ≥ 5) in both tumoral
and stromal compartments of about 70% of patients with
predominant low (H-score = 5–100) and intermediate
(H-score = 101–200) levels (Supplementary Table 1).
The representative pictures were shown in Fig. 2B. In
addition, we detected the Mer expression in all 10 samples
selected from 30 patients by western blot analysis with
expression level similar to that seen in IHC (Fig. 2A). The
4 samples with intermediate and high Mer expression also
exhibit Mer phosphorylation (pMer) in the western blots,

conditioned media (Fig. 4E, left panel). To  dissect the
key signaling pathways responsible for the increased
proliferation and migration of Mer-expressing BEAS2B cells, we subjected them to the treatments with the
inhibitors specific for signaling pathways activated
by Mer (Fig. 4E, right panel). The result showed that
inhibition of MAPK pathway by SB203580 and FAK
pathway by PF-562271 significantly blocked the increased
proliferation and migration of Mer-expressing BEAS-2B
cells respectively (Fig. 4F and 4G), indicating a critical
role of MAPK and FAK activation in mediating Merelicited proliferation and migration in lung epithelial cells
respectively. As a control, we saw few effects of pathway
inhibitors on cell proliferation and migration in control
BEAS2B-pCDH cells (Supplementary Fig. 4, left panels).
To substantiate the above findings in lung
epithelial cells, we conducted the similar experiments
in PC9 NSCLC cell line which itself exhibits litter, if
any, expression of endogenous Mer (Supplementary
Fig. 5A). Likewise, we observed that Mer overexpression
promoted the in vitro colony formation and migration in
PC9 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5B–5D). The increased
proliferation and migration of PC9 cells expressing Mer
were dependent on MAPK and FAK signaling pathways
downstream of Mer activation in that blockade of these
two pathways abrogated the increased proliferation and
migration of PC9-Mer cells respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 5E–5G). These two pathway inhibitors had a mild
effect in control PC9-pCDH cells, which was far from
reaching the suppressive effects seen in PC9-MER cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4, right panels).

a significant decrease in apoptosis relative to control
PC9-pCDH cells following erlotinib treatment (Fig. 5C).
The representative dotplots were shown in Fig.  5D. In
addition, compared with control PC9-pCDH cells, PC9Mer cells displayed a significantly decreased PARP
cleavage in response to erlotinib treatment indicative of
decreased apoptotic pathway activation at the biochemical
level (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, blockade of AKT signaling
pathway by MK2206 recovered the sensitivity of PC9Mer cells to erlotinib treatment (Fig. 5E), suggesting that
Mer expression could be an advantage for cancer cells
by enhancing drug resistance through sustained AKT
activation.

Mer inhibition reversed the resistance of
NSCLC cells to erlotinib treatment
To define the role of endogenous Mer expression
in dictating the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to EGFR
inhibitor, we selected H1965 cells harboring EGFR
mutation (delE746-A750) which is insensitive to erlotinib
treatment and express the high level of endogenous Mer.
We pretreated H1965 cells with UNC569, a recently
developed small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
specific for Mer, to block the activation of Mer, and
then evaluated the sensitivity of these cells to erlotinib
treatment by MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment
with 500 nmol/L of UNC569 effectively inhibited the
phosphorylation of Mer; furthermore, pretreatment
of H1965 cells with UNC569 at this concentration
significantly improved the sensitivity of H1965 cells to
erlotinib, resulting in an approximate 50-fold reductions
in the IC50 of erlotinib (13.65 μM vs 0.28 μM for DMSO
or UNC569 pretreatment; Fig. 6B). Annexin V/7-AAD
staining demonstrated that UNC569-pretreated H1965
cells exhibited a significantly increased apoptosis relative
to control pretreatment in response to elrotinib treatment
(Fig. 6C), which was also confirmed by increased
production of cleaved PARP at the biochemical level
(Fig. 6D). Consistent with previous studies [5], we also
observed that UNC569 treatment alone decreased H1965
cell viability by inducing their apoptosis (Fig. ­6B-6D),
suggesting a role of Mer in the survival of Meroverexpressed NSCLC cells. Treatment with UNC569
and erlotinib simultaneously inhibited the phosphorylation
of MAPK and AKT whereas either erlotinib or UNC569
treatment alone merely inhibited the activation of MAPK
but not AKT signaling pathway, which at least partially
explained the synergistic pro-apoptotic effect of both
UNC569 and erlotinib in H1965 cells (Fig. 6D) and was
also consistent with above results obtained in PC9 cells
(Fig. 5F). The data indicate that abrogating the function
of endogenous Mer can improve the therapeutic efficacy
of elrotinib treatment in otherwise erlotinib-insensitive
NSCLC cells harboring EGFR mutation.

Mer expression induces the resistance of
NSCLC cells to erlotinib treatment
Previous study shows that Mer knockdown improves
in vitro sensitivity of NSCLC cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs by increased apoptosis induction, however, whether
it is the case for EGFR inhibitor remains unexplored. To
do this, we determined the sensitivity of EGFR mutationharbored PC9 cells (delE746-A750) with or without
stable Mer overexpression to EGFR inhibitor erlotinib
by MTT assay. Mer overexpression induced a notable
resistance to erlotinib treatment in otherwise elrotinibsensitive PC9 cells, resulting in an approximate 24-fold
increase in the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) of erlotinib (0.34 μM vs 8.22 μM for control or
Mer overexpression; Fig. 5A). Analysis of EGFR-related
signaling pathways demonstrated that erlotinib treatment
did not block the AKT phosphorylation in PC9-Mer cells
though it inhibited the EGFR and MAPK phosphorylation
in both PC9-pCDH and PC9-Mer cells (Fig. 5B). We
further applied Annexin V/7-AAD staining to analyze
the apoptosis of PC9-pCDH and PC9-Mer cells in
response to erlotinib treatment. PC9-Mer cells exhibited

DISCUSSION

investigation of Mer inhibitors as potential therapeutic
agents in NSCLC.
This study shows Mer overexpression in tumor
cells of about 70% NSCLC samples of TMA and freshly
harvested tissues compared to matched paracancerous
tissues; moreover, Mer phosphorylation was also observed
among freshly harvested tissue samples with high level
of Mer expression. Gas6, protein S and galectin-3, the
ligands for Mer, have been also described to be frequently
overexpressed in tumor tissues of NSCLC [21–23],
suggesting that Mer receptor is continuously activated
in NSCLC via autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms.
Consistent with the previous findings [5], we also did not
find that Mer expression is associated with any clinical
feature of patients with NSCLC, including overall
survival of patients. It is more likely that the level of

Though the biological functions of Mer receptor
have long been well characterized in many cancers, it
is now that we start to be aware of the significance of
Mer receptor in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. This
paper extends the findings of a previous report that has
identified Mer receptor frequently overexpressed in human
NSCLC relative to surrounding normal lung tissue [5]; it
further shows that Mer receptor is short of transforming
activity since it did not confer normal lung epithelial cells
tumorigenic activity when overexpressed in them, though
it did markedly promote their proliferation and migration.
More importantly, Mer expression dictates the response
to EGFR-targeted small-molecule inhibitor of NSCLC
cells with EGFR gene mutation, warranting further

in a cell type-specific context [28]. It remains to learn
when and how upregulated Mer expression occurs in the
tumorigenesis of NSCLC; the fact that Mer expression
was not correlated with tumor stage suggests that de novo
expression of Mer in tumor cells occurs at the early stage
of tumorigenesis. Previous studies demonstrate that Axl,
another member of TAM RTK, is a transcriptional target
of both wild-type and mutant p53 [29], suggesting that
Axl can be induced by a driver of tumorigenesis; thus it
is attempting to speculate that mutant drivers of p53 etc.
might likewise upregulate the expression of Mer in the
mutant p53-carried NSCLC, which is initially supported
by the online Whole Genome RVista analysis showing the
presence of 12 p53 binding sites in the promoter region
of Mer gene (Supplementary Fig. 5). Future experiment
studies are needed to validate the above hypothesis and
to see if Mer expression is positively correlated with
p53 expression in tumor tissues. In addition, many
NSCLC lose p53 entirely leading to the unavailability
of p53 to promote Mer expression [30], therefore, other
unappreciated mechanisms for Mer overexpression would
be operative in these tumors which remains to be explored.
Previous studies show that Mer activation stimulated
MAPK, AKT and FAK signaling pathways and also

Mer phosphorylation other than total Mer expression is
related with clinical parameters of patients; thus, future
studies should evaluate the phosphorylation status of
Mer in NSCLC tumor tissues to investigate whether Mer
activation frequently occurs and whether it has prognostic
or predictive value.
Previous studies have demonstrated that Mer
expression promotes the growth and survival of NSCLC
cells [5], however, the biological effects of Mer expression
in normal lung epithelial cells remain unexplored. Herein,
we first found that Mer overexpression in human bronchial
epithelial cell line BEAS2B similarly enhanced the
proliferation, colony formation and migration, but did not
confer them of tumorigenic activity in vivo, indicating
a shortage of transforming activity for Mer in lung
epithelial cells. The results argue that, unlike the role in
leukemogenesis [24, 25], Mer expression is more likely a
propagating (passenger) factor than a driver factor in the
oncogenesis of NSCLC, which is also supported by few of
activating mutation of Mer in NSCLC and other cancers
[26, 27]. It is very likely that preneoplastic cells harboring
driver mutation get an additional impetus to progress
after Mer overexpression, which is also consistent with
the conception that TAM RTKs have a differential role

and migration conferred by Mer overexpression are
primarily dependent on MAPK and FAK signaling
pathways, respectively as blockade of MAPK and FAK
signaling pathways abrogated the increased proliferation
and migration in Mer-overexpressed lung epithelial cells
and NSCLC cells, respectively. The similar mechanisms
of action have also been identified for Mer in promoting
proliferation and migration of tumor cells in other cancers,
including melanoma, prostate cancer and glioblastoma etc
[26, 31–34]. In addition, Axl has been shown to mediate
migration and invasion of glioblastoma, lung cancer and
breast cancer cells by upregulating the expression of
matrix metalloproteinases and promoting the transition
of solid tumor cells from an epithelial to mesenchymal
morphology [9, 35–38], and whether Mer functions by
similar mechanisms in NSCLC remains to be investigated.
More importantly, this study is the first report to
document a key role for Mer in dictating the sensitivity
of NSCLC cells to EGFR-targeted agent erlotinib. Our
data clearly demonstrated that Mer overexpression
significantly attenuated the sensitivity of PC9 cells to
erlotinib treatment by decreasing apoptosis induction.
Mechanistic investigation revealed that erlotinib treatment
did not effectively inhibited AKT signaling in otherwise
erlotinib-sensitive NSCLC cells upon Mer overexpression,
suggesting that sustained AKT signal downstream of
Mer activation mediated the erlotinib resistance as
evidenced by recovered erlotinib sensitivity in Meroverexpressed PC9 cells when concomitantly treated
with an AKT inhibitor. By using Mer-specific inhibitor,
we demonstrated that blockade of Mer activity increased
the sensitivity of H1965 cells to erlotinib treatment,
further validating the key role of endogenous Mer in the
resistance of NSCLC cells to erlotinib. Previous studies
showed that Mer was required for surface accumulation of
EGFR and subsequent pathway activation in lung cancer
cells [39]; thus, it is tempting to speculate that Mer might
maintain the persistent activation of the key prosurvival
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in NSCLC cells with EGFR
mutation exposed to erlotinib by the direct (activating
AKT signal) and/or indirect (sustaining EGFR signal)
mechanisms, convergently leading to the resistance of
NSCLC cells to erlotinib. As persistent activation of PI3K/
AKT pathway has been documented play a central role in
mediating primary and/or acquired resistance of NSCLC
harboring EGFR mutation to EGFR-targeted agents [40],
the findings in this manuscript thus provide an alternative
upstream source. Future studies are warranted to explore
whether Mer expression and/or activation status in tumor
tissues would be correlated with the response of patients
with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation to erlotinib or
other EGFR-targeted agents.

Intriguingly, this study first shows that Mer
immunopositivity is similarly present in stromal
compartments of NSCLC samples which are
predominantly found in cells with macrophage
morphology, most likely tumor-associated macrophages.
The Mer expression in non-neoplastic cells found in the
tumor microenvironment may be of great significance;
in the physiological steady states, one of major functions
for Mer receptor expressed on the phagocytes of DCs
and macrophages is responsible for the maintenance
of tissue homeostasis and immune tolerance through
efferocytosis [15], the physiological process by which
apoptotic cells are engulfed by phagocytes [41]; in rapidly
proliferating tumors, apoptosis occurs with a generally
higher rate as compared with quiescent tissues; Mer
receptor on tumor-associated macrophages may perform
the same task of apoptotic cell clearance by which tumorassociated macrophages persistently uptake and present
self-antigens thus enabling to suppress the induction of
antitumor immunity. This hypothesis has been supported
by the findings that Mer deficiency in CD11b+ leucocytes
promoted a CD8+ T lymphocyte mediated antitumor
immune response and inhibited tumor growth and
metastasis in the murine tumor models [42]. In addition,
previous studies shows leukocytes can be educated to
upregulate the expression of Mer’s ligand GAS6 in a
Mer-dependent manner once they are recruited into
tumor microenvironment [43], thus supporting a model in
which Mer signaling induces GAS6 expression in tumorassociated macrophages, creating positive feed-forward
signaling acting on tumor cells and tumor-associated
macrophages through Mer [42]. In view of the abundant
presence of tumor-associated macrophages and their
pivotal role in tumorigenesis, it is of great significance to
deepen our understanding of the biological effects of Mer
in tumor stromal cells.
In sum, our data demonstrated that Mer RTK is
frequently overexpressed in both tumoral and stromal
compartments of NSCLC where it facilitates tumor
progression by promoting the proliferation and migration
of NSCLC cells via stimulating MAPK and FAK
signaling pathway respectively. Of clinical significance,
Mer expression dictates the sensitivity of NSCLC cells
harboring EGFR mutation to EGFR-targeted agent
erlotinib, providing a rationale to develop clinically
translatable compounds inhibiting Mer as potential
therapeutics to overcome the erlotinib resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples and immunohistochemistry
The study protocol was approved by the Institution
Review Board of the Second Military Medical University.

Transfection and infection

samples from 150 patients with NSCLC were purchased
from Shanghai Biochip Company of China (Cat. HLugSqu150/Sur-01, HLug-Ade150/Sur-01) which contained
150 consecutive cases of surgically resected NSCLC
(surgery time July 2004 to November 2007). The detailed
clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients are listed
in Table 1. All patients were followed until July, 2012
with a median observation time of 60.5 months (range,
1–96 months). The time of the surgery was used to
calculate the time to a given event. Overall survival (OS)
was defined as the interval between surgery and date of
death. The OS was censored at the last follow-up visit
(July 31, 2012) for patients without death. The tumors
were staged according to the International Union Against
Cancer’s tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification
and histologically subtyped and graded according to the
World Health Organization guidelines (third edition).
Freshly harvested NSCLC samples (30 cases) were
obtained from Department of Pathology, General Hospital
of Chinese People’s Armed Police Forces, Beijing, China.
The detailed clinicopathologic characteristics of the
patients are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The detailed
procedure for the immunohistochemistry of Mer protein
in the clinical samples is provided in the Supplementary
Information.
All specimens were scored independently by
two pathologists (LXW and HFW). An H-score was
determined for each specimen by multiplying the
percentage of positive tumor cells (0% to 100%) by the
dominant staining intensity (0 = negative, 1 = weak,
2 = intermediate, and 3 = strong). Thus, resulting scores
ranged from 0 to 300. Specimens with overall scores
of 0 to 4, 5 to 100, 101 to 200, and 201 to 300 were
classified as trace, low-level, intermediate-level, and
high-level expression, respectively. When two scores for
same sample from two pathologists were evaluated, the
correlation coefficient was high (0.89), indicating that
the agreement between the two pathologists was good.
Based on this result we used the average scores of the two
pathologists.

For lentiviral infection, human cDNA of Mer
(NM_006343.2) was cloned into bicistronic pCDH-T2Apuro lentiviral vector (System Biosciences) between XbaI
and BamHI restriction enzymatic site. 5 × 106 293T cells
were transfected with 4 μg of pCDH empty vector or
pCDH-Mer plasmids, and 3 μg of psPAX2 (Addgene),
1 μg of pMD2.G (Addgene), and 20 μl of Lipofactamine
2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours
post-transfection, about 5 ml of conditioned medium
containing viral particles was collected and filter
sterilized. 500 μl of viral particles was used to infect
4 × 105 BEAS2B or PC9 cells for 12 h after which viral
conditioned medium were replaced with fresh medium.
For stable expression, 1 μg/ml puromycin was used to
select BEAS2B or PC9 cells stably expressing Mer or
pCDH 72 h post-infection.

Human GAS6 conditioned medium
The human GAS6 conditioned medium (CM) was
prepared as described previously with minor modification
[44]. Briefly, 5 μg of pCMV3-human GAS6 plasmid
(Sino Biological Inc) was transfected into a 10-cm plate
of 293T cells at 70% confluence using Lipofactamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10 μg/ml vitamin
K1 (Hospira). After overnight incubation, the complete
medium with 10% FBS was then changed into 0% serum
in the presence of vitamin K1. About 24 h later, the GAS6
conditioned medium was collected. For mock-conditioned
medium, blank pCMV3 plasmid was used.

Clonogenic colony formation assay
The assay was performed as previously described
[31]. Briefly, cells were plated in triplicate wells of 6-well
dishes at a low density (150 cells/well) and cultured under
normal conditions without perturbation for 10 days. In
some assays, cells were cultured in the presence of kinase
inhibitors (concentrations see below) with supplementing
inhibitors every two days. Colonies were washed with
PBS and stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v in 25%
methanol). Stained plates were rinsed in dH2O and
allowed to dry at room temperature. The plates were
photographed, and colonies were counted using ImageJ
software.

Cell culture
The human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS2B
and NSCLC cell lines A549, H460, H1965, H2228,
H1563, and H661 cells were all purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA)
and PC9 NSCLC cells were obtained from Cell Bank of
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China).
These cells were all maintained in DMEM medium
(Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Hyclone), 100 units/l penicillin, and 100 μg/l
streptomycin (Life Technologies). The BEAS2B and PC9
cells stably expressing control or Mer were cultured in
similar medium additionally supplemented with 1 μg/ml
puromycin.

Proliferation and growth inhibition assays
For proliferation assay, BEAS2B cells stably
expressing control or Mer (1 × 103 cells per well) were
cultured in the 6-well plates in medium containing
full supplements. The cell proliferation was monitored
every 3 days by cell counting with hemocytometer. For
growth inhibition assay, cells (confluence 60–70%)

were pretreated with Mer-specific inhibitor UNC569
(Selleck) or vehicle control (DMSO) for 12 h followed by
incubation with serially diluted concentrations of erlotinib
(Selleck) for 72 h. For experiments in PC9 cells, cells were
directed with erlotinib without pretreatment procedure. At
the termination of the experiment, 20 μl of MTT assay
solution was added into 100 μl of medium containing cells
and incubated for 2 h. The absorbance of each well was
determined using a microplate reader (Molecular devices,
Sunnyvale, CA) at 492 nm with reference wavelength at
630 nm. The percentage of cell survival was defined as
the relative absorbance of untreated versus treated cells.
All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three
times.

V-FITC and 5 μl 7-AAD. The cells were gently vortexed
and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.
After addition of 400 μl of binding buffer to each tube,
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry immediately.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of immunohistochemistry data
were performed by the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences for Windows software (Windows version release
18.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics
were calculated. Continuous variables were categorized:
age at diagnosis was dichotomized at its median 63 years;
Mer H-score was categorized according to convention.
For clinical characteristics (age at diagnosis, histology
and sex), statistical significance between different levels
of each characteristic was assessed by log-rank test. On
nodal status, differentiation, stage and categorical Mer
H-score, statistical significance between different levels
of each factor was assessed by log-rank test for trend as
these variables are considered ordinal.
Statistical analyses of all other data were performed
by GraphPad Prism (Version 5.04, GraphPad Software,
Inc). Results are presented as mean ± S.D obtained from
at least three independent experiments. Differences
between groups were tested by two-tailed paired Student
t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test, and p < 0.05 is considered as significant.

Scratch/wound healing assay
BEAS2B cells stably expressing control or
Mer (2 × 105 cells per well) were plated on 6-well
plates precoated with collagen type I (5 μg/cm2, BD
Biosciences). Cells were incubated overnight yielding
confluent monolayers for wounding. Wounds were
made using a pipette tip and then cells were continued
to culture in the presence of 20% (v/v) mock or GAS6
contained conditioned media. The photographs were taken
immediately (0 h) and 24 and 48 h after wounding with a
phase-contrast microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped
with a digital camera (Leica DFC300FX). Percentage of
migration was analyzed by ImageJ software. MK2206
(4 μM), PF-562271 (1 μM), SB203580 (1 μM), or vehicle
(DMSO) were added 1 h before wounding and maintained
during migration. The experiments were carried out in
triplicate and repeated at least three times.
