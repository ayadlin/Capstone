Abstract
Immune rejection of tumors is mediated by IFNg production
and T-cell cytolytic activity. These processes are impeded by PD-1,
a coinhibitory molecule expressed on T cells that is elevated in
tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL). PD-1 elevation may reﬂect
T-cell exhaustion marked by decreased proliferation, production
of type I cytokines, and poor cytolytic activity. Although anti–
PD-1 antibodies enhance IFNg secretion after stimulation of the
T-cell receptor (TCR), the mechanistic link between PD-1 and its
effects on T-cell help (Tc1/Th1 skewing) remains unclear. In
prospectively collected cancer tissues, we found that TIL exhibited
dampened Tc1/Th1 skewing and activation compared with
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). When PD-1 bound its

Introduction
Although recent advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have been developed, the overall 5-year survival rate for
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains at
about 50%. The tumor microenvironment in patients with
HNSCC is highly immunosuppressive, suggesting a potential to
use immunotherapies to improve survival of patients with
HNSCC (1). One of the most important immune resistance
mechanisms involves coinhibitory pathways mediated by immune checkpoint receptors (ICR), such as CTLA-4, PD-1, BTLA,
and LAG-3. These ICRs and their ligands are commonly overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment (2–6), suggesting a
promising approach to activate antitumor immune response of

ligand PD-L1, we observed a marked suppression of critical TCR
target genes and Th1 cytokines. Conversely, PD-1 blockade reversed these suppressive effects of PD-1:PD-L1 ligation. We also
found that the TCR-regulated phosphatase SHP-2 was expressed
higher in TIL than in PBL, tightly correlating with PD-1 expression
and negative regulation of TCR target genes. Overall, these results
deﬁned a PD-1/SHP-2/STAT1/T-bet signaling axis mediating the
suppressive effects of PD-1 on Th1 immunity at tumor sites. Our
ﬁndings argue that PD-1 or SHP-2 blockade will be sufﬁcient to
restore robust Th1 immunity and T-cell activation and thereby
reverse immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.

T cells by blockade of ICRs (7). CTLA-4 antagonistic mAb
(ipilimumab) has signiﬁcant activity in patients with metastatic
melanoma (8) and was approved by FDA in 2010 for melanoma.
Anti–PD-1 mAbs have also demonstrated clinical efﬁcacy in earlystage clinical trials for various tumor types and may provide
durable antitumor responses (9). However, despite the clinical
beneﬁt of ICR antagonist antibodies, the mechanism of improved
immune response is still poorly understood.
Optimal T-cell–based antitumor immunity requires both Tc1biased CD8þ T cells acting as cytolytic effector cells and CD4þ
Th1 cells, to enhance the potency and duration of antitumor
response. In response to IFNg and IL12, STAT1 and STAT4 bind
to the Tbx21 (encoding T-bet) enhancer and induce a T-bet–
dependent Tc1 response (including IFNg production and cytolytic
development) in CD8þ T cells (10). Development of Th1 cells
requires a multistep mechanism in which the transcription
factors STAT1, T-bet, and STAT4 are sequentially activated (11,
12). Sustained tumor regression that results from antitumor
therapies such as cancer vaccines is dependent on a strong type
I immune response. In contrast, CD4þ Th2 cells induce M2-biased
tumor-associated macrophages and suppress CD8þ antitumor
response, driving a more tumor-permissive microenvironment
(1). Therefore, skewing to a type I–dominant tumor microenvironment is indispensable to enhance efﬁcacy of antitumor
immunotherapy.
Although blockade of the PD-1 pathway (PD-1/PD-L1) enhances production of IFNg (a hallmark Th1 cytokine) and cytolytic activity of tumor-inﬁltrating T cells in both tumor-bearing
mice and patients with cancer (13, 14), the link between PD-1 and
type I immunity remains vague. After clustering with the T-cell
receptor (TCR) for antigen during inﬂammatory conditions, PD-1

PD-1/SHP-2 Inhibits Type I Response and TCR Activation in TME

can recruit the phosphatase SHP-2 (15, 16) and relieve SHP-2
from its autoinhibited state (17). In contrast, blockade of PD-1
signaling inhibits phosphorylation of SHP-2 (18). We therefore
hypothesized that PD-1 suppresses beneﬁcial type I–dominant
immune responses in the tumor microenvironment through the
PD-1/SHP-2/p-STAT1/T-bet axis. Stimulation of the TCR and
CD28 would lead to activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p-S6
pathway, which is important for sustaining T-cell survival and
expansion (19). Thus, PD-1 might interfere with TCR/CD28
signaling to mediate the suppression of T-cell survival and proliferation in patients with cancer. In addition, PD-1 can turn off
TCR/CD28 signals by inhibiting TCR-proximal kinases in T cells.
In this study, we used unique, paired, freshly isolated tumorinﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes
(PBL) specimens to investigate the in vivo phenotypic and functional impact of PD-1 expression on TCR signaling and Th
skewing directly in the tumor microenvironment of patients with
cancer, since these TILs have appeared to be more suppressed than
in the peripheral circulation (2).

Patients and Methods
Patients and specimens
Peripheral blood samples and fresh tumor specimens were
obtained from 41 patients with HNSCC. All patients were seen
in the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and all subjects signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University
of Pittsburgh (IRB# 99-06; Pittsburgh, PA). The clinicopathological features of the patients with HNSCC in this study are shown
in Table 1. The patient cohort included 7 females and 34 males
with a mean age of 58 years (range: 26–74 years).
Collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumorinﬁltrating lymphocytes
Venous blood from patients with HNSCC was drawn into
heparinized tubes and centrifuged on Ficoll–Hypaque gradients
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were recovered, washed in RPMI-1640 medium
(Sigma), and either used immediately for experiments or resuspended in freezing media containing 10% DMSO, transferred to
Mr. Frosty containers (Thermo Scientiﬁc), and stored at 80 C
until ﬂow-cytometric analysis. For TIL isolation, fresh tumors
from patients with HNSCC were minced into small pieces manually or using a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec), then
transferred to 70-mm cell strainers (BD) and mechanically separated using the plunger of a 5-mL syringe. The cells passing
through the cell strainer were collected and subjected to Ficoll–
Hypaque gradient centrifugation. After centrifugation, mononuclear cells were recovered and stored at 80 C until ﬂow-cytometric analysis or immediately used for experiments.
Antibodies and ﬂow cytometry
The following anti-human antibodies were used for staining:
CD3-Alexa Fluor 700, FOXP3-PerCP/Cy5.5, phospho-STAT1
(pY701)-PE, phospho-STAT4 (pY693)-Alexa Fluor 488, and Tbet-BV711 purchased from BD Biosciences, CD3-PE-Cy7, PD-1PerCP/Cy5.5, and CD25-PE-Cy7 purchased from Biolegend,
CD8-PE-TR and CD4-PE-TR purchased from Life Technologies,
PD-1-APC (Clone: MIH-4, eBioscience), phospho-S6 (Ser235/
236)-Alexa Fluor 488 (Cell Signaling Technology), SH-PTP2

www.aacrjournals.org

(C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and APC-conjugated F(ab')2
fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Intracellular staining of FOXP3, SHP-2, p-STAT1, T-bet, p-STAT4, and
p-S6 was performed as follows: PBMCs or TILs were stained with
surface marker antibodies, ﬁxed with ﬁxation/permeabilization
buffer (eBioscience), washed, and stained for intracellular antigens in 1 permeabilization buffer. Cells were analyzed on an
LSRFortessa (BD) or CyAn (Dako) ﬂow cytometer, and data
analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star) or Summit V4.3 software
(Dako), respectively. The acquisition and analysis gates were
restricted to the lymphocyte gate based on characteristic properties of the cells in the forward and side scatter. Dead cells were
excluded on the basis of viability dye staining (Zombie Aqua
Fixable Viability Dye, Biolegend).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections were
deparafﬁnized and dehydrated in xylene and graded ethanol
solutions. Antigen retrieval was conducted in Tris-EDTA buffer.
Immunoperoxidase stains were performed according to a standard protocol on the Ventana Benchmark Ultra platform.
PD-L1 antibody was provided by Dr. Gordon Freeman at
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). PD-1 was
stained using a mAb NAT105 at 1:500 titration. IFNg antibody
was purchased from Abcam and incubated at 1:500 titration.
Staining was interpreted by an oral and maxillofacial pathologist. Both the intensity and percentage of area of staining
were evaluated. Representative pictures of matching areas were
taken at 400.
Restimulation of TIL using anti-CD3/-CD28/hIgG1 or antiCD3/-CD28/PD-L1 beads
LEAF puriﬁed anti-human CD3 (clone UCHT1, Biolegend),
LEAF puriﬁed anti-human CD28 (clone CD28.2, Biolegend) plus
PD-L1-hIgG1 Fc fusion protein (R&D Systems) or control human
IgG1 (Southern Biotech) was covalently coupled to Dynabeads
M-450 Epoxy beads according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Life Technologies). We kept constant the total amount of protein
at 5 mg per 107 beads as previously described (20). Generally, 107
beads were coated with 1 mg of anti-CD3 (20% of total protein), 1
mg of anti-CD28, and 60% of either PD-L1-hIGg1 Fc fusion
protein or control human IgG1. Covalent coupling of the proteins
to the beads was performed in 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate
buffer for 24 hours at room temperature with gentle tilting and
rotation.
TILs were freshly isolated from tumor specimens and subjected to restimulation experiments. Total TILs were cultured
with beads at a ﬁxed cell:bead ratio of 1:10. Brieﬂy, 0.5  106
TILs were plated in a 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plate with
beads in 200 mL RPMI-1640 complete media in the presence of
100 mg/mL anti–PD-1 (BMS-936558) or hIgG4 isotype control
provided by Bristol–Myers–Squibb, or 50 mmol/L fusaruside
(6) as indicated. After 48-hour incubation at 37 C with 5%
CO2, supernatants were collected and cells were stained and
subjected to ﬂow-cytometric analysis.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed with phospho-SHP-2
(Tyr580) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), SH-PTP2 Antibody (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal anti–
b-actin antibody (Sigma).

Results
TILs have dampened Tc1/Th1 phenotypic responses and
activation status compared with PBL
To determine the status of Tc1/Th1 activation of T cells
in the tumor microenvironment, we analyzed expression of
p-STAT1, T-bet, and p-STAT4 in T cells from paired PBLs and
TILs from patients with HNSCC. Interestingly, CD8þ TIL had

signiﬁcantly lower p-STAT1, T-bet, and p-STAT4 expression
at baseline (Fig. 1A and B, p-STAT1: P ¼ 0.005; T-bet: P ¼
0.0003, and p-STAT4: P ¼ 0.02), lower p-STAT1 and T-bet
after TCR stimulation (Fig. 1C and D, p-STAT1 and T-bet:
P ¼ 0.03) compared with PBL, which also correlates with
deﬁcient expression of perforin in CD8þ TIL (unpublished
data). CD4þ TIL possessed similar p-STAT1 and slightly higher
T-bet but dramatically lower p-STAT4 at baseline (Fig. 2A
and B, T-bet: P ¼ 0.002 and p-STAT4: P ¼ 0.02), lower
p-STAT1 and T-bet after TCR stimulation (Fig. 2C and D,
p-STAT1 and T-bet: P ¼ 0.03) compared with PBL. Foxp3CD4þ T cells also manifested a similar abortive Th1 differentiation program in TIL.
Next, we investigated the activation status of TIL marked by
expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6), a
downstream target of the PI3K pathway (21). As expected,
expression of p-S6 was signiﬁcantly lower in CD8þ and CD4þ
TIL than in PBL at baseline (Figs. 1A and B and 2A and B, CD8:
P ¼ 0.0001 and CD4: P ¼ 0.005) and poststimulation (Figs. 1C

PD-1 suppresses TCR-stimulated upregulation of p-STAT1,
T-bet, and p-S6
Despite the fact that PD-L1, the major ligand for PD-1, is
variably and heterogeneously expressed on HNSCC tumor cells
(4 and Supplementary Fig. S1), we observed colocalization of
PD-1þ TIL with PD-L1þ tumor cells in vivo in the tumor
microenvironment (Fig. 3), indicating that the PD-1 inhibitory
signaling is relevant and functional in the tumor-inﬁltrating
T cells. Having demonstrated impaired Tc1/Th1 responses and
activation of TIL, we investigated whether PD-1 signaling could
directly regulate p-STAT1 and T-bet, which are important reg-

ulators of the Th1 phenotype, in the tumor microenvironment.
To explore this possibility, we generated anti-CD3/-CD28/
PD-L1 or anti-CD3/-CD28/hIgG1 (control Ab)-coated beads.
Total TILs isolated from patients with HNSCC were stimulated
with these beads in the presence or absence of anti–PD-1 blockade (BMS-936558). Interestingly, TIL that highly expressed
PD-1 showed lower p-STAT1 and T-bet, when stimulated with
anti-CD3/-CD28/PD-L1 beads, than when stimulated with
anti-CD3/-CD28/hIgG1 beads. This result indicates that PD-1
ligation with polyvalent PD-L1 suppresses upregulation of
p-STAT1 and T-bet due to TCR stimulation. In addition,
anti–PD-1 blockade can restore p-STAT1 and T-bet expression
in TIL stimulated with anti-CD3/-CD28/PD-L1 beads (Fig. 4A–
C, P ¼ 0.02 and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), which
suggests that inhibition of PD-1 signaling using a clinically

effective blocking mAb could reverse the suppressive effects
of PD-1 on Th1 phenotypic responses. However, anti–PD-1
blockade did not increase p-STAT1 or T-bet expression in TIL
stimulated with anti-CD3/-CD28/hIgG1 (isotype control mAb)
beads.
Next, we investigated whether PD-1 signaling interferes
with signals downstream of TCR activation. Of interest,
p-S6, which can be upregulated by TCR signaling, was
decreased by the ligation of PD-1 using PD-L1–coated beads.
Consequently, blockade of PD-1 by anti–PD-1 Ab (BMS936558) restored upregulation of p-S6 (Fig. 4A and D, P ¼
0.02 and Supplementary Fig. S2C). These ﬁndings suggest
that PD-1 signaling interferes with activation of downstream
T-cell activation molecules (such as p-S6) induced by TCR
stimulation, promoting dysfunction of T cells in the tumor
microenvironment.

PD-1 suppresses secretion of Th1 cytokines but not Th2
cytokines by TIL upon TCR stimulation
Because we observed that PD-1 could suppress p-STAT1 and
T-bet, the transcription factors regulating production of Th1
cytokines by CD8þ and CD4þ T cells, we next investigated
whether production of Th1 cytokines upon TCR stimulation is
inﬂuenced by PD-1 ligation or anti–PD-1 blockade. Supernatants of TIL cultured with anti-CD3/-CD28/hIgG1 or antiCD3/-CD28/PD-L1 beads for 48 hours, with or without anti–
PD-1 blockade (BMS-936558), were analyzed by Luminex
for Th1/Th2 cytokines secretion. As expected, secretion of
the Th1 cytokines IFNg (P ¼ 0.008), TNFa (data not shown),
and IL2 (P ¼ 0.02, P ¼ 0.04) was lower in TIL with
anti-CD3/-CD28/PD-L1 stimulation, compared with those
stimulated with anti-CD3/-CD28/hIgG1, whereas PD-1 blockade Ab could reverse the inhibitory effects of PD-1:PD-L1

P ¼ 0.002). In addition, the MFI of SHP-2 was even higher in
PD-1þ TIL than in PD-1 TIL (Fig. 5B, CD8, CD4: P ¼ 0.002).
We also observed that the levels of SHP-2 expression in tumorinﬁltrating T cells from patients with HNSCC positively
correlated with PD-1 expression (Fig. 5C, R2 ¼ 0.8643,
P ¼ 0.02). Together, these observations strongly suggest that
expression of SHP-2 correlates with PD-1 expression, particularly at the tumor sites.

by PD-1 ligation or PD-1 blockade (Fig. 4E). To validate our ex
vivo ﬁndings in vivo, we conducted immunohistochemistry
analysis of PD-1 and IFNg in serial sections of the original
tumor tissues. When expression of PD-1 on TIL was high, the
amount of IFNg in the tumor microenvironment was low
(Tumor 1), and vice versa (Tumor 2, Fig. 4F). Taken together,
these ﬁndings suggest that PD-1 signaling negatively regulates
Tc1/Th1 responses by suppressing activation of p-STAT1 and Tbet and secretion of Th1 cytokines.
SHP-2 is overexpressed in TIL and strongly correlates with
PD-1 expression
After ligand binding, PD-1 clusters with the TCR and can
recruit SHP-2 to its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch
motif (ITSM), where SHP-2 is phosphorylated (22). SHP-2
has been suggested to be a mediator of PD-1 inhibitory signals
(23, 24). Because PD-1 is highly expressed in TIL (22, 24), we
examined whether expression of SHP-2 itself correlates with
PD-1 expression on TIL from patients with HNSCC. Expression of SHP-2 was tested in paired PBL and TIL from patients

SHP-2 activation by fusaruside suppresses p-STAT1/T-bet and
production of Th1 cytokines
Because SHP-2 can function as a negative regulator of
p-STAT1 in tumor cells (15) and lymphocytes (16), we next
investigated whether activation of SHP-2 regulates the inhibitory effects of PD-1 signaling on p-STAT1 and T-bet. To
investigate this possibility, we used fusaruside, a small-molecule compound that speciﬁcally induces phosphorylation of
SHP-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3; refs. 16, 25), to activate SHP-2
directly in TIL, bypassing ligand engagement of PD-1. As shown
in Fig. 6A, upregulation of p-STAT1 and T-bet by TCR/CD28
stimulation was inhibited by fusaruside (50 mmol/L for
48 hours), even when the PD-1 signaling pathway was blocked
(P ¼ 0.03). These results indicate that activation of SHP-2
suppresses p-STAT1 and T-bet in a fashion similar to PD-1
signaling. We also tested Th1/Th2 cytokines in the supernatants
of TIL cultured in the presence or absence of fusaruside with
TCR stimulation. Consistent with decreases in p-STAT1 and
T-bet, activation of SHP-2 by fusaruside suppresses production
of the Th1 cytokines IFNg (P ¼ 0.02, P ¼ 0.008), TNFa (data
not shown) and IL2, but not the Th2 cytokine IL10 (Fig. 6B).
Therefore, PD-1 appears to suppress Tc1/Th1 phenotypic
responses that are controlled by p-STAT1/T-bet in the tumor
microenvironment by recruiting and activating SHP-2 to skew
away from a Th1-biased antitumor response.

Discussion
In this study, we provide a mechanistic explanation for
how PD-1 suppresses type I immunity and T-cell activation
in the tumor microenvironment. First, we show that TILs that
express signiﬁcantly more PD-1 manifest dampened Tc1/Th1
phenotypic responses and activation status compared with T
cells in PBL. Second, ligation of PD-1 to PD-L1–coated beads
suppresses p-STAT1, T-bet, p-S6 and production of Th1 cytokines due to TCR stimulation, while an antagonist PD-1 mAb
(BMS-936558) can reverse the negative effects of PD-1 signaling. Third, we demonstrate that SHP-2, the downstream
mediator of PD-1, is increased in TIL and is tightly correlated
with PD-1 expression. Furthermore, activation of SHP-2 by
fusaruside can bypass PD-1 signaling to induce suppression
of Tc1/Th1 phenotypic responses marked by expression of
p-STAT1 and T-bet and secretion of Th1 cytokines. Taken
together, our study describes a novel function for PD-1 in
suppressing type I immunity, through inhibition of p-STAT1/
T-bet, via SHP-2 activation, and in antagonizing TCR/CD28
signaling to decrease p-S6 expression.
Immune escape of tumors results from loss of tumor antigen
expression (due to loss of expression of strong rejection antigens

or loss of MHC class I molecules; refs. 26, 27) and establishment of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
Immunosuppression of effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment is mediated by increased expression of coinhibitory
receptors (such as PD-1 and CTLA-4) that inhibit activation
of T cells, or by immunosuppressive cytokines (such as TGFb
and IL10) derived from both tumor cells and inﬁltrating Treg
and MDSC (28–31). These inhibitory mechanisms are consistent with our observation of a dampened Th1/Tc1 phenotypic
response in TIL (Figs. 1 and 2).

In the ongoing clinical trials of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 therapies,
there is discussion of whether clinical responses to PD-1/PD-L1
blockade correlate with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells or
immune cells. Recently, a report on the clinical trial of anti–PD1 mAb (BMS-936558) therapy in patients with cancer showed
that pretreatment expression of PD-L1 on tumors was associated with enhanced clinical responses (9). In our restimulation
system, anti–PD-1 blockade did not increase expression of pSTAT1 and T-bet or production of Th1 cytokines in TIL stimulated with anti-CD3/-CD28 alone. This might be because

when we isolated TIL, PD-L1þ tumor cells interacting with PD1þ TIL in the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 3) were depleted,
so that PD-1 ligands were much less abundant than in the
tumor sites. Therefore, we might only observe beneﬁcial effects
of anti–PD-1 blockade on type I antitumor immunity when
PD-L1 is reintroduced into the culture to mimic the real tumor
microenvironment. Our ﬁndings also suggest an important role
for PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in triggering PD-1 inhibitory signaling in the interacting T cells (Fig. 4).
Type I–biased innate effector cells (such as IL12-producing DC
and IFNg-producing NK/NKT cells) are crucial for inducing Th1
CD4þ cells and Tc1 CD8þ cells with optimal cytotoxicity and
effector functions for tumor cell lysis. Adoptive transfer of Th1
cells (32) and antigen-speciﬁc Tc1 cells (33) elicits strong antitumor activity. In contrast, type II–biased effector cells, which

516 Cancer Res; 75(3) February 1, 2015

produce IL4, IL10, and TGFb, negatively regulate type I antitumor
immunity and make the tumor microenvironment more tumor
permissive. Thus, Th1/Tc1-biased antitumor immunity is highly
desirable for rejection of tumors by the host immune system.
Alteration of the Th1/Th2 balance should therefore be considered
as a strategy for cancer immunotherapy, too.
PD-1 blockade has been shown to augment Th1 and Th17
responses (as evidenced by increased production of IFNg, IL2,
TNFa, IL6, and IL17) and to suppress production of the Th2
cytokines IL5 and IL13 in reactivated T cells from peripheral blood
of patients with prostate and advanced melanoma cancer (34).
However, in our system, PD-1 signaling inhibits production of
Th1 cytokines (IFNg, IL2, and TNFa) by TIL, without altering
production of the Th2 cytokine IL10 (Fig. 4E). In contrast, IL4
and IL5, the other two Th2 cytokines, were below the limit of

PD-1/SHP-2 Inhibits Type I Response and TCR Activation in TME

detection, indicating that they might not be actively produced by
TIL even with TCR stimulation. We think that the PD-1/SHP-2
signaling interferes with the Th1 skewing but not directly acts on
Th2 differentiation. Fully differentiated Th2 phenotypes would
not appear without some Th2-driving condition(s). Thus, PD-1
blockade appears to enhance Th1 responses but may not alter Th2
responses in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, in CT26
tumor-bearing mice, injection of anti–PD-L1 antibody induces
higher levels of T-bet in CD8þ TIL (35). What is more, phosphorylated SHP-2 can selectively sequester STAT1 from kinases that
mediate phosphorylation and thus suppress the STAT1-dependent Th1 immune responses (16). Taken together, these ﬁndings
suggest that Th1 immunity can be efﬁciently modulated by PD-1
or SHP-2.
In conclusion, anti–PD-1 blockade, which is being actively
explored as an immunotherapy agent in clinical trials and has
shown clinical efﬁcacy in several solid tumors, can improve Tcell–based immunotherapy by restoring a robust type I antitumor
immunity and enhancing T-cell activation. Biomarkers of anti–
PD-1 activity are needed to monitor the efﬁcacy of this type of
immunotherapy, which we suggest should include successful
restoration of Th1 phenotypes. In addition, SHP-2 inhibitory
strategies might be a powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy.
Thus, SHP-2 not only suppresses Tc1/Th1 skewing of tumorinﬁltrating T cells, but also inhibits pSTAT1-dependent expression
of HLA/APM (elements of the antigen processing machinery), and
secretion of T-cell attracting chemokines RANTES and IP10 (15)
and the cytokine IL12 (unpublished data) by head and neck
cancer cells. Therefore, development of a speciﬁc SHP-2 inhibitor
would be a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy in the
future.
