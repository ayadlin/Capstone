cells [5,6]. We believe it is important to highlight these
observations, as a widely spread view is that activating
p53 in vivo would trigger severe cytotoxic responses in
normal tissues. Experimental data supporting this notion
comes from animal studies where the expression of p53’s
major negative regulator, mdm2, was suppressed [7].
However, such undesired side effects do not occur when
p53 is activated in a buffered manner using nutlin-3, an
agent that binds directly to mdm2 [4], partially impairs
mdm2’s down-regulating activity on p53 [8], and
stabilises mdm2 [9]. Indeed, nutlin-3 has been shown
to protect normal cells from mitotic poisons such as
the aurora kinase inhibitor VX680 [10], taxanes [5,6],
and polo-like kinase inhibitors [11]. Most interestingly,
nutlin-3 protects mice from PLK1 (polo-like kinase
1) inhibitor–induced neutropenia without abating the
anticancer potency of the mitotic poison [11]. In their
recent article, Apontes et al., (2011) provide additional
evidence supporting the potential suitability of nutlin-3
for cyclotherapy purposes. Indeed, nutlin-3 also protects
normal cells from nocodazole, a compound that −like
the vinca alkaloids used in the clinic− inhibits tubulin
polymerisation.
The results summarised above suggest that nutlin-3
could constitute an ideal agent for chemoprotection
purposes in patients with p53-deficient tumours.
However, the clinical use of this compound has not yet
been approved. In a recent paper, we tested the possibility
of using low doses of actinomycin-D, an approved drug
that at nanomolar concentrations can increase p53 activity
in a similar manner to nutlin-3 [12]. Yet, there are some
important differences between the p53 responses to
nutlin-3 and LDActD that can be understood on the basis
of their different from mechanisms of action [9]. Like
nutlin-3, LDActD has a primarily cytostatic effect on p53
wild-type normal cells and protects them from subsequent
treatment with VX680 [13]. Unfortunately, LDactD

There is no novelty in stating that conventional
cancer therapeutics are highly mutagenic, unselective
and toxic. Hair loss, neutropenia, vomiting, and immune
suppression are just some of the immediate side effects.
In addition, genomic damage induced by these agents can
result in second tumours later in life. Cancer cells differ
from normal cells in a number of hallmarks that define
the tumour phenotype [1]. These traits, which involve
genetic and epigenetic changes in tumour suppressors
and oncogenes, constitute a double-edged sword for
cancer cells. They provide a proliferative advantage but,
importantly from a treatment prospective, also mean an
increased dependence on certain cellular functions as
well as an increased vulnerability to particular insults.
The goal of cancer treatment is to exploit this differential
sensitivity to selectively kill tumour cells whilst sparing
normal tissues. Classically, the search for new anticancer
therapies has focused on the discovery of agents that
annihilate tumour cells at least as effectively as existing
chemotherapeutics whilst having weaker or negligible
effects on healthy tissues. Alternatively, so-called
cyclotherapy strategies aim at improving the therapeutic
window by selectively shielding normal cells from
conventional anticancer drugs [2,3]. The majority of such
drugs target dividing cells. Hence, if we could transiently
and selectively pause proliferation in normal tissues,
subsequent treatment with S- or M-phase poisons should
eradicate cycling tumour cells only.
Nutlin-like compounds are well-established nongenotoxic activators of the p53 pathway [4] currently
undergoing clinical trials for treating patients with
cancers retaining wild-type p53. In addition, nutlin-3 has
been proposed as a potential chemoprotective agent for
patients bearing tumours with mutant p53. The rationale
behind this use is that nutlin-3 has been shown to have a
mild, reversible cytostatic effect on a variety of normal

pretreament also protects p53-deficient tumour cells
against VX680 to a small extent. Our hope is that LDActD
might perform better in a p53-based cyclotherapy setting
when combined with S-phase poisons than with mitotic
poisons. In this line, nutlin-3 has been shown to prevent
the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine and
cytosine arabinoside in normal cells without diminishing
the killing effect of these compounds on p53-mutant
tumour cells [14].
In the article featured here [6], aside from nutlin-3,
Blagosklonny’s group evaluate other clinically-approved
drugs as chemoprotective agents against the tubulin
poisons nocodazole and paclitaxel. The two well-known
drugs chosen for this purpose are rapamycin, a drug with
striking anti-ageing properties, clinically used to prevent
transplant organ rejection (in chronic administration
with traditional immunosuppressants) [15], and the

anti-diabetic drug metformin. The authors show that
pretreatment with these drugs succeeds in protecting all
normal cell types tested against these mitotic poisons,
whilst having little impact on the vulnerability of a
cancer cell line with mutant p53. The chemoprotective
effects might be related to the interesting observations
that glucose starvation selectively protects primary cells
against cyclophosphamide in cell culture and fasting
reduces the side effects of chemotherapy in patients
[16,17]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that lack of p53
may sensitise cancer cells to metabolic stresses such as
nutrient deprivation [18]. The study by Apontes et al. also
addresses whether combining two chemoprotective agents
could lead to an even greater increase in the therapeutic
window of mitotic poisons. In this regard, nutlin-3 plus
rapamycin and rapamycin plus metformin gave the most
promising results.
Like in the case of the nutlins, the efficacy of
metformin and rapamycin is currently being assessed in
clinical trials for cancer [19,20]. Independently of whether
these tests are successful, the encouraging data presented
by Apontes and co-workers suggests that there might be
other avenues for these compounds in cancer therapy.

a small-molecule p53 activator to patients bearing p53-mutant

inducing a mild reversible cell-cycle arrest. Subsequent treatment
with conventional anticancer drugs should then kill proliferating
cancer cells, whilst leaving normal cells untouched.
