ABSTRACT
The role of HER4 in breast cancer is controversial and its role in relation to
trastuzumab resistance remains unclear. We showed that trastuzumab treatment and
its acquired resistance induced HER4 upregulation, cleavage and nuclear translocation.
However, knockdown of HER4 by specific siRNAs increased trastuzumab sensitivity
and reversed its resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Preventing HER4
cleavage by a γ-secretase inhibitor and inhibiting HER4 tyrosine kinase activity by
neratinib decreased trastuzumab-induced HER4 nuclear translocation and enhanced
trastuzumab response. There was also increased nuclear HER4 staining in the
tumours from BT474 xenograft mice and human patients treated with trastuzumab.
Furthermore, nuclear HER4 predicted poor clinical response to trastuzumab
monotherapy in patients undergoing a window study and was shown to be an
independent poor prognostic factor in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our data suggest
that HER4 plays a key role in relation to trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive
breast cancer. Therefore, our study provides novel findings that HER4 activation,
cleavage and nuclear translocation influence trastuzumab sensitivity and resistance
in HER2 positive breast cancer. Nuclear HER4 could be a potential prognostic and
predictive biomarker and understanding the role of HER4 may provide strategies to
overcome trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.

and epiregulin (co-ligands with EGFR/HER1) [3, 4]
or heregulin (NRG1-4) [3, 5, 6]. HER4 activation by
its different ligands results in variable combination
of HER4 as dimers and transphosphorylation on its
tyrosine residues, as well as the initiation of a cascade of
downstream signaling pathways [3-7].
The role of HER4 in breast cancer remains

HER4 is a cell surface receptor that belongs to the
human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER/ErbB)
family [1, 2]. The signaling by HER4 is initiated through
ligand binding of heparin-binding EGF, betacellulin

controversial. In many studies, HER4 has been identified
to have an anti-proliferative activity, which is contrary to
other HER family members [8-10]. In addition, positive
HER4 expression was shown to be associated with an
increased survival rate of breast cancer patients [11]. A
recent study conducted among HER2 positive breast
cancer patients demonstrated that HER4 is predictive
of longer event-free survival (EFS) in patients with ER
positive tumours [12]. That study is in agreement with
previous reports that linked high HER4 expression with
low tumour grade, low proliferation rate and positive
score for ER and PR in breast cancer [13-15]. However,
there are also some studies correlated HER4 with
increased cellular growth and oncogenic properties [1618]. Bieche [19] reported that breast cancer patients with
tumours overexpressing HER4 had a shorter survival rate,
suggesting HER4 maybe an important biomarker for poor
prognosis.
The role of HER4 in relation to trastuzumab
treatment and resistance remains unclear. Although HER4
expression has been shown to improve trastuzumab
response [20, 21], there has been no detailed report on
how trastuzumab affects HER4 expression, activation
and cleavage and how these processes mediate sensitivity
and resistance to trastuzumab in HER2 positive breast
cancer cells. The aim of this study is to elucidate the
role and prognostic significance of HER4 expression
and localisation in relation to trastuzumab treatment and
resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.

the Neomarkers’ antibody to the cytoplasmic domain
of HER4, western blots showed that there was also
an increase of HER4 bands at 110 kDa and 120kDa in
BT474 cells, which were not clearly seen in SKBR3
cells (Figure 1C). However, these two additional bands
could be visualised using another anti-HER4 antibody
from Santa Cruz. The immunoblot using these two
different HER4 antibodies showed that the bands around
180 kDa, 110 kDa, 120 kDa and 80kDa (also known as
m80) decreased following HER4 silencing, indicating
that these are specific HER4 bands (Figure 3B). In HER2
negative MCF7 cells, trastuzumab treatment and heregulin
stimulation also induced an upregulation of HER4 at
180kDa but no obvious increase in HER480kDa was detected
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Since one-hour trastuzumab
treatment upregulated HER4 expression, we next
determined the dose effect of trastuzumab on HER4 at
this time point. There was a dose responsive upregulation
of HER480kDa from 10 to 20 µg/ml trastuzumab in SKBR3
and BT474 cells but no further increase beyond 20 µg/ml
dose was seen (Supplementary Figure 1C). No obvious
changes in HER2 level could be detected with increasing
doses of trastuzumab treatment in SKBR3 and BT474
cells after 1 hour.

HER4180kDa and HER480kDa increase upon acquired
resistance to trastuzumab
We also performed a time-course experiment to
assess the effect of trastuzumab treatment on HER4
expression in SKBR3 and BT474 cells in comparison
with the acquired resistant cells generated in the lab [23]
(Supplementary Figure 1D). In the parental SKBR3 cells,
trastuzumab treatment significantly increased HER4180kDa
and HER480kDa after a 24-hour treatment (n=3, p<0.01)
and also in acquired resistant SKBR3 cells (n=3, p<0.001)
(Figure 1D, left panel). Similar results were seen in the
parental and resistant BT474 cells (Figure 1D, right
panel). In contrast to trastuzumab-resistant cells that
were continuously treated with trastuzumab, an overnight
trastuzumab withdrawal reduced HER4180kDa and HER480kDa
significantly (n=3, p<0.001) in the trastuzumab-resistant
SKBR3 cells but not in the resistant BT474 cells (Figure
1D). There was also a statistically significant increase
of HER4 mRNA levels after trastuzumab treatment and
upon acquired resistance (Figure 1E). Withdrawal of
trastuzumab from the resistant SKBR3 cells decreased
HER4 mRNA level (n=3, p<0.001) (Figure 1E, left
panel), which was not seen in BT474 cells (Figure 1E,
right panel).

RESULTS
Trastuzumab treatment and exogenous heregulin
stimulation induce the upregulation of HER4180kDa
and HER480kDa in HER2 positive breast cancer
We have previously reported that gefitinib and
trastuzumab induce the endogenous release of heregulin
in HER2 amplified breast cancer cells [22, 23]. In this
study, we compared the effect of trastuzumab to exogenous
heregulin stimulation on HER4 expression and activation
in HER2 amplified SKBR3 and BT474 cells. MCF7 cells
were used as the control cell line since they have a low
level of HER2. The basal expression of HER4 in SKBR3
was comparable to the expression in MCF7, although it
was lower in BT474 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Using two different antibodies of HER4 cytoplasmic
domain, we showed that exogenous heregulin stimulation
increased HER4 protein; and the mRNA levels were
concordantly upregulated (Figure 1A-C). Similarly,
exogenous heregulin stimulation or one-hour trastuzumab
treatment resulted in an upregulation of HER4180kDa
and HER480kDa forms as well as an increase of HER4
phosphorylation in SKBR3 cells (Figure 1B). Using

Heregulin stimulation and trastuzumab treatment
induce HER4 nuclear translocation

nuclear translocation in acquired resistant SKBR3 cells
(n=3, p<0.001) (Figure 2A, right panel) and resistant
BT474 cells (n=3, p<0.05) (Supplementary Figure 2B).
Trastuzumab withdrawal in trastuzumab resistant SKBR3
cells significantly decreased the percentage of positive
nuclear HER4 cells (n=3, p<0.01) (Figure 2A, right panel).
Cell fractional experiments showed that trastuzumab
treatment upregulated HER4180kDa but not HER480kDa in
the cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 2B). However, there was
an increased HER480kDa in the nuclear fraction, correlated
with the HER4 localisation seen in confocal experiments
(Figure 2B).
We also investigated an in vivo BT474 xenograft
model. We first optimized HER4 immunohistochemistry

We next assessed the effect of heregulin stimulation
and trastuzumab treatment on HER4 localisation. In
untreated parental SKBR3 cells, HER4 was localized
to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (Figure
2A). Heregulin stimulation (Supplementary Figure 2A)
and trastuzumab treatment (Figure 2A) induced HER4
nuclear localisation in SKBR3 cells. Compared to the
untreated SKBR3 cells, the percentage of the cells that
had nuclear HER4 staining was increased at 24 hours
after trastuzumab treatment (n=3, p<0.001) (Figure
2A, right panel). There was also increased basal HER4

shows the western blot of HER4 after 100ng/ml heregulin stimulation at different time points in SKBR3 cells. Right, SKBR3 cells were
stimulated with 100ng/ml heregulin and HER4 expression was assessed by RT-PCR. HER4 mRNA of each group was quantified relative
to the untreated cells, and normalised to β-actin. (B & C) SKBR3 and BT474 cells were treated with 40μg/ml trastuzumab or stimulated
with 100ng/ml heregulin for one-hour before western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. Two different anti-HER4 antibodies, HER4
(Neomarkers) and HER4 C18 (Santa Cruz: SC283) were used. The quantification of HER4 protein level was done for anti-HER4 antibody
from Neomarkers after normalised to β-actin (bottom panels). Means ± SD from three independent experiments are shown in the graph
(*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001). (D) The figures show the representative western blots (upper panels) of HER4 and their quantification

trastuzumab-resistant cells (with or without trastuzumab 24 hr withdrawal). The resistant cell lines were previously generated by a
continuous treatment with 40µg/ml trastuzumab for more than 8 months [23]. (E) HER4 mRNA levels of sensitive and trastuzumab
resistant SKBR3 and BT474 cells were measured. β-actin mRNA was used for normalization and the quantification was relative to the
untreated cells. The means of HER4 mRNA ± SD from three independent experiments are shown in the graph (**p<0.01, ***p<0.001).

(IHC) staining using a HER2 positive cell pellet
(Supplementary Figure 2C). Figure 2C (left panels)
shows an example each of HER4 IHC staining on BT474
xenograft tumour samples treated with either control or
trastuzumab [24]. In the untreated group, HER4 cytoplasm
was stained homogenously with no or minimal HER4
staining in the nucleus. Following trastuzumab treatment
for two and half weeks, HER4 was increased at both
cytoplasm and nucleus but only nuclear HER4 staining
was statistically significant (median IRS score=3, n=3)
compared to the control (median IRS score=0, n=5)
(p<0.05) (Figure 2C, right panel). Taken together, the
data shows that trastuzumab treatment and resistance
induced HER4 nuclear translocation in vitro; and there
was increased cytoplasmic and nuclear HER4 staining in

BT474 xenograft models treated with trastuzumab.

HER4 knockdown decreases cell viability and
enhances trastuzumab response
To further understand the role of HER4 in
trastuzumab-treated HER2 positive breast cancer cell
lines, we performed HER4 knockdown by transient
transfection with specific HER4 siRNAs, with or without
trastuzumab treatment. Two independent HER4 siRNAS,
HER4 siRNA10 and HER4 siRNA11 diminished HER4
mRNA and protein expression significantly in SKBR3
cells and BT474 cells (Figure 3A and 3B). The addition
of trastuzumab increased HER4 mRNA and protein levels
in the control siRNA treated cells (Figure 3A and 3B).

differences between the groups (**p<0.01, ***P<0.001). (B) Western blot analysis was performed on the cytoplasmic and nuclear

staining by IHC in untreated and trastuzumab treated BT474 xenografts. The xenografts consist of mice treated with either trastuzumab
or control for two weeks [24]. HER4 expression was scored semiquantitatively using the immunoreactive score (IRS) as described in
the methods. Right, the cytoplasmic and nuclear HER4 scorings of trastuzumab-treated and the control groups are presented in a graph.
Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the difference in median IRS scores between the untreated and trastuzumab-treated group. The
statistical significance was denoted as * p<0.05.

Although HER4 silencing could not completely prevent
trastuzumab-induced increase in the mRNA and protein
levels of HER4, they were less than the control siRNA
treated cells (Figure 3A and B). HER4 knockdown
also lead to a decrease of HER4 phosphorylation in
trastuzumab treated and untreated cells (Figure 3B).
Although HER4 knockdown had no effect on HER2
level, there was a decrease in pHER2 level, indicating the
dependency of HER2 activation on HER4.
We proceeded to assess the effect of HER4
knockdown with or without trastuzumab treatment using
cell viability experiments in SKBR3 and BT474 (Figure
3C). Although HER4 knockdown alone has a minimal
effect in decreasing the cell number and apoptosis in
both cell lines, it had an inhibitory effect on tumour

colony formation in SKBR3 cells (and not in BT474
cells) (Figure 3C-E). However, HER4 knockdown
enhanced trastuzumab sensitivity significantly as shown
by decreasing cell number and colony formation as well
as increasing apoptosis in both SKBR3 and BT474 cells
compared to the control cells (Figure 3C-E).
To further assess the role of HER4 in acquired
resistance to trastzumab, HER4 was also silenced in
trastuzumab resistant cells in the presence or absence
of continuous trastuzumab treatment. Trastuzumab
withdrawal decreased HER4 m80 and pHER4 in the
resistant SKBR3 cells but not in the resistant BT474
cells (Figure 4A and 4B). HER4 and its phosphorylation
also decreased after HER4 knockdown with and without
combination treatment with trastuzumab (Figure 4A and

4B). Although total HER2 level remained unchanged,
pHER2 level increased when trastuzumab was withdrawn
from trastuzumab-resistant cells transfected with either the
control or HER4 siRNAs (Figure 4A and 4B).
HER4 knockdown had an inhibitory effect on the
cell count and reversed trastuzumab resistance in both
resistant cell lines continuously treated with trastuzumab
(Figure 4C and 4D). However, trastuzumab withdrawal
diminished the inhibitory effect of HER4 knockdown in
the resistant cells (Figure 4C and 4D).

resulting in the production of cleaved HER480kDa and its
nuclear translocation [25, 26]. Since we have shown that
trastuzumab increased HER480kDa and induced its nuclear
translocation in HER2 positive breast cancer (Figure 2A
and 2B), we tested whether a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSi)
could prevent HER4 nuclear localisation induced by
trastuzumab treatment. Although trastuzumab treatment
increased HER480kDa (Figure 5A), the combination
treatment of trastuzumab with GSi in SKBR3 prevented
the increase. Figure 5B (left panel) shows the confocal
images from SKBR3 treated with GSi, in the presence or
absence of trastuzumab treatment for 24 hour. GSi alone
decreased HER4 intensity in the nucleus compared to the
control (n=3, p<0.001) (Figure 5B). In addition, Figure
5B also shows that when GSi was added to trastuzumab,
not only did it decrease trastuzumab induced nuclear
HER4 enhancement, but there was also an upregulation
of cytoplasmic HER4 intensity. The decreased of the
percentage of positive nuclear HER4 staining in the

γ-secretase inhibitor decreases HER4 cleavage
and nuclear translocation as well as enhancing
trastuzumab sensitivity
Gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) is involved in the
proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane HER4 following
the initial release of extracellular domain by ADAM17,

combination treatment of GSi and trastuzumab was
statistically significant compared to trastuzumab alone
or trastuzumab with DMSO (n=3, p<0.001) (Figure 5B,
right panel). After 3 days of treatment, trastuzumab in
combination with GSi resulted in a significant decrease
in cell viability of SKBR3 cells compared to trastuzumab
alone or GSI alone (Figure 5C, upper panel). There were
also a significant increase in the number of apoptotic
SKBR3 cells, when treated with the combination of GSi
and trastuzumab, as compared to trastuzumab alone or GSi
alone (Figure 5C, bottom panel). In trastuzumab-resistant
SKBR3 cells continuously treated with trastuzumab,
GSi decreased HER480kDa in the nucleus (Figure 5D).
Trastuzumab withdrawal resulted in a decrease in the
nuclear HER480 but GSi did not further change its level
in resistant SKBR3 cells. Trastuzumab withdrawal in
the trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells did not show any
significant effect on colony formation. However, GSi
decreased colony formation in resistant cells with or
without trastuzumab treatment (Figure 5E).

greater inhibitory effect of the combination treatment of
neratinib with trastuzumab compared to trastuzumab alone
on colony formation in both sensitive and resistant SKBR3
cells (Supplementary Figure 3B).
In BT474 xenograft models treated with
trastuzumab and/or neratinib [28], there was an increase
in cytoplasmic and nuclear HER4 staining in xenograft
tumour samples treated with trastuzumab. There was no
difference in the nuclear and cytoplasmic HER4 scorings
between those treated with neratinib and the control.
However, trastuzumab-induced HER4 upregulation was
prevented by the combination treatment of trastuzumab
with neratinib (Figure 6D). The decrease in nuclear HER4
scoring was statistically significant in the combination
treatment of trastuzumab and neratinib (median IRS
score=0, n=5) compared to trastuzumab alone (median
IRS score=6, n=5) (p<0.05) (Figure 6D, right panel).

Nuclear HER4 is a prognostic factor in HER2
positive breast cancer patients

Neratinib
prevented
trastuzumab-induced
upregulation of HER4 in the cytoplasm and the
nucleus

To assess the prognostic value of HER4 localisation,
we stained TMAs from a well-annotated cohort of HER2
positive breast cancer patients for HER4 expression. The
characteristics of the patients and tumour parameters are
listed in Supplementary Table 1. The results showed that
high cytoplasmic HER4 was significantly correlated with
better overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival
(RFS) than that of patients with low cytoplasmic HER4
(OS: HR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.04-0.80, p = 0.024; RFS:
HR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09-0.85, p = 0.026) (Figure 7A).
In contrast, Kaplan-meier analysis of nuclear HER4
expression demonstrated an inverse correlation between
positive nuclear HER4 expression and patient survival
(IRS score ≥ 1 vs IRS score = 0; OS: HR = 13.63, 95%CI
= 2.88-64.53, p < 0.001; RFS: HR = 6.08, 95%CI = 1.7820.81, p = 0.004) (Figure 7B). In a multivariate analysis
with nuclear HER4-derived groups adjusted for ER and
nodal status, nuclear HER4 remained an independent
prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.002) and RFS (p = 0.011);
whereas cytoplasmic HER4 appeared to be a weak
prognostic predictor of OS (p = 0.059) and RFS (p =
0.058) (Supplementary Table 2).

Neratinib is an irreversible TKI targeting tyrosine
kinase activities of HER1, HER2 and HER4 [27]. We have
previously reported that neratinib enhances trastuzumab
response and is effective in overcoming the acquired
resistance of trastuzumab [28]. However, its effect on
HER4 cleavage and localisation was not investigated.
Since HER4 cleavage is induced upon its activation [3-7],
we proceeded to assess the effect of neratinib on HER4
deactivation as well as its expression and localisation in
HER2 positive breast cancer cells. As expected, neratinib
decreased HER4 tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in
SKBR3 cells (Figure 6A). Neratinib treatment (in the
presence or absence of trastuzumab) led to a decrease in
both 180 kDa and 80 kDa of HER4 in the total cell lysate
of SKBR3 cells (Figure 6A). In the parental and resistant
BT474 cells, neratinib also decreased the intensity of
several HER4 bands around 180kDa, 110kDa and 80kDa
with and without trastuzumab in the total cell lysate
(Supplementary Figure 3A).
We also performed cell fractionation experiments
and showed that neratinib prevented trastuzumabinduced increase of HER480kDa in the nucleus after 24h
neratinib treatment in SKBR3 cells. However, neratinib
alone did not decrease m80 in the nucleus (Figure 6B).
Confocal images also showed that there was a decrease
in the percentage of cells with positive HER4 staining
in the sensitive and resistant SKBR3 cells treated with
a combination treatment of trastuzumab and neratinib,
as compared to trastuzumab treatment alone (both n=3,
p<0.001) (Figure 6C). These results correlated with a

response to trastuzumab monotherapy, including a higher
tumour volume (r=0.859, p=0.023) and Ki67 level ratios
(r=0.897, p=0.014) (Figure 7E). However, there was no
statistically significant difference in the tumour nuclear
HER4 expression between baseline and after neoadjuvant
chemo with trastuzumab (Supplementary Figure 4A). In
addition, nuclear HER4 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy

did not correlate with the tumour volumes and Ki67 values
obtained from definitive surgery (Supplementary Figure
4B).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed that trastuzumab treatment
upregulated HER4 at 180 kDa and 80 kDa in SKBR3 and
BT474 cells, the common HER4 variants reported from
the previous study [29, 30]. HER480kDa has been described
as a cleaved fragment of HER4 and is known to translocate
to the nucleus [8, 31-33]. Our study demonstrates
that trastuzumab-induced HER480kDa correlated with
increased HER4 nuclear intensity from confocal images

patients were stained for HER4 expression by IHC. Patients were split into two groups according to the positive and negative cytoplasmic
and nuclear HER4 staining as defined in the methods section. The relapse-free survival and overall survival of the two groups were plotted
in Kaplan-Meier curves according to the cytoplasmic and nuclear HER4 staining in breast cancer patients (n=73). (C) A schematic diagram
shows a window of opportunity study conducted among HER2 positive breast cancer patients who received trastuzumab monotherapy
followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab before surgery. Tumour specimens were collected at the baseline, 21 days after
trastuzumab monotherapy and at the final stage after completed 4 cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy 100 mg/m2 with 6mg/kg
trastuzumab. (D) Nuclear HER4 expression was analysed using IHC in paired tissue samples (baseline and at 21 days) from 5 patients who
received one dose of trastuzumab monotherapy. The differences in HER4 IRS scores between the pairs were asssesed by paired t-test (*

day 21 and baseline) using linear regression (upper panels). The table below shows the HER4 scorings of the individual 5 patients with their
respective tumour volume and Ki67 ratios.

and increased cleaved HER4 fragment (HER480kDa) in
the nuclear fraction of trastuzumab treated cells. The
xenograft experiments also showed that nuclear HER4
staining was significantly increased in the tumours of the
mice treated with trastuzumab compared to the untreated
group. Furthermore, trastuzumab resistant SKBR3 and
BT474 cells showed an increased intensity of nuclear
HER4 compared to the sensitive cells. These results
suggest that HER4 cleavage and nuclear translocation
occurs during trastuzumab treatment and resistance.
Depending on the antibodies used and in different
cell lines (Figure 1B and 1C), we also observed the
appearance of multiple HER4 bands at 180kDa, 120kDa,
110 kDa and 80 kDa. To our knowledge, no study has
reported HER4 variants at 110 and 120 kDa. However,
these bands were confirmed to be specific to be HER4
by the siRNA experiments (Figure 3B). From the recent
publications, other HER receptors were also reported to
have multiple variants, including HER2 at 185, 150, 110
and 95 kDa of molecular weight [34, 35] and multiple
HER3 variants in Schwann cell model [36]. We therefore
suggest that a future study could be carried out to
characterize HER4 variants at 110 and 120 kDa to assess
whether they could represent different HER4 isoforms or
alternative cleaved fragments.
Although HER4 has been shown to have an antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cells [8-10], we
showed that HER4 silencing decreased cell viability
and enhanced trastuzumab effect as well as reversed its
resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Our study
suggested that during trastuzumab treatment, HER4 may
mediate trastuzumab resistance and reduces its inhibitory
effect. This seems to contradict other studies [20, 21].
However, the controversial effect of HER4 may be
related to its cellular localisation. HER4 has been shown
to translocate to the nucleus following its cleavage and
interact with different transcription factors [32, 37-41].
Since trastuzumab induces the release of endogenous
heregulin [23] and this could induce γ-secretase-mediated
HER4 cleavage and nuclear localisation [26], we utilized
γ-secretase inhibitor and showed that it decreased m80
and nuclear HER4 translocation in HER2 positive breast
cancer cells when combined with trastuzumab. This was
correlated with an increase in apoptosis and decreased
cell proliferation, consistent with reports that γ-secretase
inhibitor could inhibit heregulin-dependent tumour growth
[26, 42]. Our study provides evidence that HER4 nuclear
translocation during trastuzumab treatment is due to its
proteolytic cleavage mediated by γ-secretase. However,
we could not exclude that the growth inhibition by
γ-secretase inhibitor could also be due to its effect on other
signaling pathways, e.g. Notch or E-cadherin [43, 44].
There has been a recent study investigating the
combination effect of a ganmma-secretase inhibitor in
combination with docetaxel chemotherapy in breast
tumorgraft models and in patients with advanced breast
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer [44]. The combination of both drugs resulted in
a preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients (11 partial
response out of 24 evaluable patients). However, this
study used gamma-secretase inhibitor to inhibit Notch
signaling and stem cell renewal but not HER4 cleavage.
To our knowledge, we are not aware of any study that
combines trastuzumab with gamma-secretase inhibitor
to target HER4 cleavage and nuclear localization in
HER2 positive breast cancer. It is hoped that our study
may generate interest in targeting HER4 cleavage using
gamma-secretase inhibitor in HER2 positive breast cancer
and possibly other cancers.
To assess whether HER4 cleavage and nuclear
translocation during trastuzumab is due to its tyrosine
kinase activity, we utilized neratinib, which is an
irreversible panHER inhibitor that has an effect against
EGFR, HER2 and HER4 tyrosine kinase activity [45,
46]. We showed that whereas trastuzumab increased m80
and HER4 nuclear translocation, neratinib could prevent
the induction of m80 and HER4 nuclear translocation
induced by trastuzumab. This highlights the importance
in understanding the molecular mechanisms of actions
and resistance between different anti-HER2 therapies. The
different effects of neratinib and trastuzumab on HER4
could be one of the reasons why their combination was
more effective than either drug alone in preclinical models
[28].
The prognostic value of HER4 expression in
relation to breast cancer survival has been controversial
and could be attributed to different HER4 isoforms and
its localization [11, 13, 17, 47-49]. Four different HER4
mRNA spliced isoforms known as JM-a/CYT1, JM-a/
CYT2, JM-b/CYT1 and JM-b/CYT2 have been reported,
which are derived from the alternative HER4 mRNA
splicing [30, 50, 51]. In contrast to JM-b variant, the JM-a
region consists of Adam-17 (TACE) cleavage site that
allows initial process of HER4 proteolytic cleavage to
produce the extracellular domain (ECD) and intracellular
domain (ICD) [25, 29, 52]. This is followed by further
cleavage of HER4 intracellular domain by the γ-secretase
at the transmembrane domain, resulting in the nuclear
translocation of HER4 [26].
A recent study of HER4 isoform expression in breast
cancer demonstrated a correlation between JM-a isoforms
(CYT1 and CYT2) with longer patients’ survival [12]. In
addition, studies have shown that cytoplasmic HER4 is
linked with improved survival of breast cancer patients
[12, 47]. In our cohort study, we also demonstrated a
similar pattern that high level of cytoplasmic HER4 had a
better prognosis in HER2 positive breast cancer patients.
However, positive nuclear HER4 was correlated with
poorer outcomes in HER2 positive breast cancer patients,
which is in agreement with Juntilla’ study [17]. These
suggested that the different reports of HER4 on breast
cancer survival might be due to failure to look at clinical
significance of HER4 localisation in these patients.

HER4 transient transfection

HER4 expression has been reported to be associated
with increased sensitivity to trastuzumab in patients with
metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer [21]. Although
HER2 and HER4 dimerization appeared to be oncogenic
[53] , a recent study showed that patients with HER2/
HER4 co-over-expression had a better outcome after neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy and adjuvant trastuzumab
therapy [20]. However, these studies did not directly assess
HER4 expression in pre and post-trastuzumab treatment
samples or assess the relation of nuclear HER4 to the
response to trastuzumab monotherapy and prognosis of
patients. Although we only had a small number of patients
in our study, we have demonstrated that trastuzumab
induced nuclear HER4 upregulation and that nuclear
HER4 correlated with poorer trastuzumab response as
well as shorter survival in HER2 positive patients. It will
be important to further assess the significance of HER2/
HER4 dimerization in relation to trastuzumab treatment
and prognosis of HER2 positive breast cancer patients
using validated HER dimerization assays [54].
In summary, this study provides a first report on
the effect of trastuzumab treatment in HER4 cleavage
and its nuclear translocation in HER2 positive breast
cancer. Downregulation of HER4 and strategies to inhibit
HER4 cleavage and nuclear translocation (by neratinib
and γ-secretase inhibitor) enhances trastuzumab response
and reverses its resistance. Furthermore, we showed that
nuclear HER4 is an adverse prognostic factor and may
predict poorer trastuzumab response in HER2 positive
breast cancer. Further validation is required in large
independent randomized trial to further determine the
prognostic and predictive role of HER4 in relation to antiHER2 treatment in breast cancer patients.

The cells were transfected with specific interfering
RNAs for HER4 (Qiagen) followed by trastuzumab
treatment. The transfection reagent in a final volume of
2 ml/well were prepared an hour before being added onto
the cells, which comprising the final volume of 20nM
HER4 siRNA, the Oligofectamine and the Optimem
serum-free medium. HER4 expression was determined
at 72-hour post transfection in both protein and mRNA
levels. To determine the siRNA HER4 efficiency, scramble
siRNA (All Star Negative siRNA) was used as a control.

Analysis of HER4 expression
Western blotting and RT-PCR were performed to
demonstrate the expression of HER4 protein and mRNA.
Protein lysates preparation and western blot procedure
were done according to a standard protocol described
previously [23]. For western blot, the antibodies against
c-terminus HER4 (Santa Cruz), c-terminus HER4
(Neomarkers), phospho-HER4 (Santa Cruz, CA) were
used.
Total RNA was harvested from the cell lines with
Total RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (10 ng)
was reverse transcribed using the iScript DNA synthesis
kit, with a melting temperature of 62°C. Quantitative
RT-PCR assays were performed using standard SYBRGreen protocol. The following primers were used: HER4,
forward 5’-TGT GAG AAG ATG GAA GAT GGC-3’,
reverse 5’-GTT GTG GTA AAG TGG AAT GGC-3’,
β-actin, forward 5’-GGCGGCACCACCATGTACCCT-3’,
reverse 5’-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3’. The
exponential route of CT value was converted into a linear
form using the 2 –ΔΔCT-relative calculation methods. The
β-actin was used as the relative control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells culture

Cellular fractionation

MCF-7, BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines were provided
by cell services lab at Cancer Research UK (Lincoln’s
Inn Fields laboratory), which has a stringent quality
control in cell authenticity and has incorporated shorttandem repeat (STR) profiling for cell line validation.
Trastuzumab resistant cell lines were generated as
previously reported [22, 23, 28]. The MCF7, SKBR3,
and trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cell lines were grown
in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 10% FBS and with
100 IU/ml Penicillin, 100 mg/ml Streptomycin (PS).
The BT474 and trastuzumab-resistant BT474 cell lines
were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and
the same concentration of PS. All cells were grown in a
humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Routinely, the
cells were sub-cultured once a week and the medium was
changed for three times per week.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
kit (Thermo Scientific) was used to obtain cytoplasmic
and nuclear extracts from the experimental cell lines,
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Both of the
cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were then prepared as
loading samples for western blot analysis of HER4.

Confocal microscopy
The immunofluorescence staining for HER4 was
performed to assess HER4 localisation in relation to
trastuzumab treatment and resistance. Approximately
10,000 of cells were seeded onto coverslips in 24-wells
plate, a day before cell treatment. After treatment, the
medium containing drugs were discarded and the cells

were rinsed with PBS twice. The cells were incubated
with fixation reagents; 4 % PFA, Triton-X and Natrium
Borohydrate, before blocking with 3% BSA. HER4
primary antibody was incubated for 3 hours and a
subsequent incubation with Alexa-546 conjugated
secondary antibody (rabbit) for 1 hour. The coverslips
holding the treated cells was than mounted onto a
microscope slide using the DAPI Fluoromount-G. The
slides were visualized using the confocal microscopy.

which was performed from April 2010 to December 2012.
Patients’ clinical information was obtained from accessible
medical records.

HER4 immunostaining

Prior to drug treatment or siRNA transfection,
approximately 10,000 cells were plated in 24-wells
plate a day before. The cells were then treated with the
indicated drug(s) or conditions for 3 or 6 days. On the
day of experiment, the treated cells were washed in PBS
and harvested with trypsin before cell counting using the
Coultier counter.

The IHC technique was performed to assess HER4
expression in xenograft tumours and patients’ tumours.
HER4 expression level was scored semiquantitatively
using the immunoreactive score (IRS). The final IRS
score was determined by multiplying the intensity score
(3, strong; 2, moderate; 1, mild; and 0, no staining), with
the scoring of the percentage of positive cells (4, >80%; 3,
51–80%; 2, 10–50%; 1, <10%; 0, 0%), giving the scoring
between 0 (no staining) and 12 (maximum score). HER4
staining was catagorized into negative cytoplasmic HER4
(IRS <6) or positive cytoplasmic HER4 (IRS≥6); negative
nuclear HER4 (IRS=0) or positive nuclear HER4 (IRS≥1)
staining.

FACS analysis

Statistical Analysis

To assess apoptosis, the cells were stained with 5 μl
annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and 5 μl of
propidium iodide (PI). The analysis was run using a flow
cytometry detector, FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson).
The apoptotic cells were analysed at the early stage
(annexin-V-positive, PI-negative) and the late apoptotic
stage (annexin-V-positive, PI-positive).

The data analysis was done using the GraphPad
Prism 6 for MAC OS X. For in vitro experiments,
statistical analyses were performed using t-Test for a
comparison between two groups and one-way ANOVA
with Bonferonni’s multiple comparison test for a
comparison among multiple groups. Data were expressed
as means ± SD. In in vivo models, the Mann-Whitney
test was used to compare the medians of HER4 protein
level between two groups while the Kruskal Wallis with
Dunn’s multiple comparison test was applied on the
analysis involving more than two groups. The KaplanMeier survival curves analysis and the multivariate Cox
proportional hazards modeling were carried out in R
statistical environment (v.2.14.1) (R package: survival
v2.36-14), to correlate HER4 scorings with disease-free
and overall survivals. In addition, the correlation of HER4
scorings with the other clinical parameters was assessed
using Fisher’s Exact test. For all statistical analysis, P
values of < 0.05, <0.01 and <0.001 were considered as
statistically significant and were marked as *, ** and ***
respectively.

Cell count experiments

Xenograft studies
The animal experiments have been described in
previous publications for trastuzumab treatment [24] or
trastuzumab with neratinib treatment [28].

Human tissue samples
Tissue microarrays (TMA) of HER2 positive breast
cancer patients were obtained from Oxford Radcliffe
Biobank. The use of TMAs complies with the Human
Tissue Act 2004 of UK. Patients’ characteristics and
histology including age, sex, tumour grade, menopausal
states, lymph node(s) and ER status as well as patient
deaths and recurrences were obtained from the medical
records.
A set of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
tissues was obtained from a clinical trial conducted at
UOM Patologia Mammaria-Az. Instituti Ospitalieri
di Cremona. This study was approved by local ethical
approval (Protocol CE-21392/2012). This study included
consecutive cases of HER2 positive breast cancer patients
that underwent trastuzumab window study followed by
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab treatment,
