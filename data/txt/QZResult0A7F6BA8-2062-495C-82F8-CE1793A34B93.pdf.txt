BACKGROUND: Historically, the first treatment choices for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) were splenectomy and alphainterferon. Recently, purine analogues (pentostatin and cladribine) changed radically the treatment modality, inducing complete and durable responses in the majority of patients. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of
different lines of therapy in 121 HCL patients followed in their institute from 1986 to 2008, with a median follow-up of
105 months. Patients were divided into subgroups according to the number of treatments; Group A included 121
patients who underwent a front-line therapy, Group B patients (n ¼ 53) were treated with 2 lines, Group C patients
(n ¼ 34) with 3 lines, Group D patients (n ¼ 17) with 4 lines, and Group E patients (n ¼ 8) with 5 lines. RESULTS: In
Group A, 92 (77%) patients obtained a complete response (CR), 23 (18%) a partial response, and the remaining 6
(5%) a minor or no response; median duration of response was 2.7 years. In Group B, 53 relapsed patients achieved a
second CR rate of 73.5%; median duration of response was 2.5 years. Group C contained 34 patients in a second
relapse, with a CR rate after the third line of treatment of 70.5% (median duration of response, 2.2 years). In Group D,
11 (64.7%) patients obtained a CR (median duration of response, 1.6 years), and in Group E 4 (50%) of 8 patients
achieved a CR (median duration of response, 1.3 years). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the high risk (>40% of
all patients) of retreatment of HCL patients and the need to maximize primary response. Cancer 2010;116:4788–92.

Hairy cell (HC) leukemia (HCL) has always attracted interest out of proportion to its frequency. Over the years, the
reasons for this high level of interest have varied, but have always been underpinned by hematologists’ fascination with the
distinctive cytology and biology of HCs. After recognition of the disease as a distinct entity in the 1950s,1 interest initially
centered on correct diagnosis. From the start, the diagnosis was recognized to have important therapeutic implications.
Somewhat counterintuitively, given the activated appearance of the HC and the frequent presence of cytopenias, the
disease was recognized to behave in an indolent fashion and to be resistant to aggressive chemotherapy.
Before the introduction of purine analogues, treatment with splenectomy and interferon-alpha was a common
approach that led to clinical and hematologic responses, but they were rarely complete, and median survival was only
4 years.1,2 Patients who undergo splenectomy have a better 5-year overall survival than those who do not; however, the
5-year survival is only 55% to 60%.3,4 Treatment of HCL changed dramatically approximately 20 years ago, when it was
shown that patients who had been given 20 -deoxycoformycin or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine had achieved durable complete
remission (CR).5,6 Treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine or 20 -deoxycoformycin resulted in 80% to 90% CR, with a
relapse rate of 25% to 30% at 3- to 5-year follow-up.7 In past years, several reports8-14 of long-term follow-up studies with
a single purine analogue have confirmed that the overall CR rates are very similar, ranging from 76% to 98%, and the
relapse rates are equally comparable, showing that about 30% to 40% of patients would relapse after 5 to 10 years of
follow-up. These reports indicate that both purine analogues are highly effective and lead to excellent overall survival;
however, it appears that neither purine analogue is likely curative, because molecular studies suggest that all patients have
evidence of minimal residual disease while in CR.15 Recently, Else and coworkers16 reported their data on both agents.
They reviewed data on 233 patients treated with either 20 -deoxycoformycin or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine after a median
follow-up of 16 years. The authors have extensive long-term experience with both agents, and concluded that there was no

significant difference in outcome between the 2 agents.
They estimated that the overall CR rate is 80%, and the
median relapse-free survival is 16 years. In patients who
relapse, second response rates are high, and the remissions
are quite durable. For those patients still in remission at
5 years, about 25% will relapse by 15 years.
The conclusions from these long-term follow-up
studies involving purine nucleoside analogues show that
enormous progress has been made with prolongation of
patient survival. Substantial evidence of residual disease
after therapy may account for the 40% relapse rate
over time. The survival curve for patients reported in
long-term studies has not reached a plateau.
The actual therapeutic problem is related to the
concept that this disease has not been eradicated or cured;
there is a need for continued study in this field to define
the optimal therapeutic regimen; in particular, the need
for additional biologic or immunologic agents should be
investigated.

Herein, we retrospectively review our institutional
series of 121 HCL patients with a long follow-up, explaining the presence of particular subsets of patients with the
need of several treatments during the outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Our clinical database of consecutive patients with HCL
(n ¼ 129) was retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 121
patients were included in this study. We analyzed the outcome of the different lines of therapy in 121 HCL patients
followed in our institute from 1986 to 2008, with a
median follow-up of 105 months. This was a retrospective
review of the data after treatment was completed and was
not a clinical trial. The patients were not treated uniformly but according to the optimal therapeutic approach
used in the different periods. Table 1 summarizes the
characteristics of all 121 patients at diagnosis.
The diagnosis of HCL was established by morphology, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analysis
of peripheral blood, bone marrow, and/or spleen
specimens. HCL variant was excluded by the study.
Treatment
Patients were divided into subgroups according to the
number of treatments. Group A included all the 121
patients who received the first line of therapy; among
these, 68 patients received only the first-line treatment.
Group B was represented by 53 patients treated with
2 lines of treatment; Group C had 34 patients who
underwent 3 lines; Group D included 17 patients with
4 lines of therapy; and Group E was represented by
8 patients treated 5 times.
Table 2 shows the different therapeutic approaches
in the 5 subgroups. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine was given in
3 different schedules according to the different periods: 1)
by continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.1 mg/
kg/d over 7 consecutive days; 2) by 2-hour intravenous

infusion for 5 consecutive days at 0.14 mg/kg/d; and 3) by
2-hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg once
a week for 5 consecutive weeks. 20 -deoxycoformycin was
administered at 4 mg/m2 intravenously every 2 weeks
until maximal response, consolidated with 2 further doses.
For both treatments, prophylaxis was given with
cotrimoxazole against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Rituximab was administered at the conventional dose of
375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 consecutive weeks.
Response Criteria
Response was evaluated at 3 months after treatment by
morphology and immunophenotyping of peripheral
blood and bone marrow biopsy. The criteria for response
were those of the Consensus Resolution.17 Briefly, a CR
was defined as a morphological absence of HCs in the
blood and bone marrow and normalization of any organomegaly and cytopenias. A partial response (PR) required
normalization of peripheral counts, together with at least
50% reduction in organomegaly and bone marrow HCs,
and <5% circulating HCs. All other responses were
considered as nonresponses.
In addition, relapse after CR was defined as the
reappearance of HCs in the peripheral blood or bone
marrow, development of cytopenias, and/or splenomegaly
on physical examination. Relapse after PR was a >50%
increase of residual disease.

RESULTS
Figure 1 explains the response and the mean duration of
response of the different lines of therapy. In this report,
we included CR and PR patients in the median duration
of response evaluation.

feron, and 3 splenectomy, resulting in 77% CR, 18% PR,
and 5% nonresponders (NRs). Fifty-three patients
relapsed, with a median duration of response of 2.7 years
(range, 0.52-14.88 years). In particular, the median
duration of response of CR patients was 4.1 years (range,
1.10-14.88 years). They were retreated with 4 different
lines of therapy: 41 with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 5 with
20 -deoxycoformycin, 5 with alpha-interferon, and 2 with
rituximab, resulting in 73.5% CR and 15% PR; 11.5% of
patients were NRs. The median duration of response was
2.5 years (range, 0.23-9.39 years). Thirty-four patients
underwent third-line of therapy; in particular, 23 patients
received 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 4 20 -deoxycoformycin,
5 rituximab, 1 splenectomy, and 1 alpha-interferon,
resulting in 70.5% CR and 20.5% PR; 9% of patients
were NRs. Seventeen patients relapsed, with a median
duration of response of 2.2 years (range, 0.67-8.39 years).
They were retreated with 4 different lines of therapy: 11
with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2 with 20 -deoxycoformycin, 2 with rituximab, and 2 with alpha-interferon,
resulting in 64.7% CR and 23.5% PR; 11.8% of patients
were NRs. Eight of 17 patients experienced disease
progression, after a median duration of response of
1.6 years (range, 0.64-1.98 years). These 8 patients
received a fifth line of therapy, and after treatment (3 2chlorodeoxyadenosine, 4 rituximab, and 1 splenectomy)
only 1 relapsed, with a duration of response of 1.3 years.
Table 3 summarizes the responses in the different
lines of treatment. The ability to attain CR decreased with
each course of therapy. Although relapse rates remain
relatively stable after each course of treatment (43.8%
after first line, 64.1% after second line, 50% after third
line, 47% after fourth line), there is a reduction in median
duration of response with successive courses of treatment.
There were 15 deaths in this series (12.5%); 5 deaths
(4.1%) were HCL-related, after refractory disease. One
(0.9%) patient died because of a secondary malignancy, 6
(5%) patients died as a consequence of cardiovascular

events, and 1 patient (0.9%) died in an accident. For 2
(1.6%) patients, the cause of death remains unknown.

DISCUSSION
The last 2 decades have represented an exciting period
for clinicians involved in the care of patients with HCL.
Four new drugs, alpha-interferon, 20 -deoxycoformycin,
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and rituximab, have been identified as highly effective in the treatment of this rare disease. The advances in the treatment of HCL over the past
20 years have resulted in survival curves similar to those
for the appropriate age-related cohorts. Although prolonged remissions are usually seen after treatment with
purine analogue drugs, a proportion of patients are
primarily resistant to these agents, and it is probable that
a significant proportion of those entering remission will
ultimately relapse.
Relapses occur in up to 40% of patients in several
long-term follow-ups, regardless of the purine analogue
that was used as first-line therapy.8,11-14,16,18-20 After
relapse, treatment with an additional course of purine
analogues is recommended. It is acceptable to repeat the
same treatment that was given initially, although changing
to a different purine analogue will yield the same results.
Although the ability to obtain a CR decreases with each
course of therapy, the probability of achieving CR does
not seem to be affected by the agent that is used.14,16
The present analysis extends the follow-up of 121
patients consecutively treated at the Seràgnoli Institute
with different therapeutic approaches (70% with purine
analogues as front-line treatment) according to the
period (from 1986 to 2008). Also in the further lines of
treatment, the purine analogues were the most used
drugs: 86% (second line), 79% (third line), and 77%
(fourth line); only with the fifth line, the subset of 8
heavily treated patients, were purine analogues used in
only 37.5%. With a median follow-up of 105 months,
this series shows the real scenario in terms of clinical
outcome of HCL patients, represented by several progressions/relapses in >40% of all study population;
extrapolating, there is a small subset of patients with
refractory disease.
The ability to achieve CR decreased with each
course of therapy: from 77% of the front line to 50% of
the fifth line (second line, 73.5%; third line, 70.5%;
fourth line, 64.7%). Although relapse rates remained
relatively stable after each course of treatment (43.8%
after first line, 64.1% after second line, 50% after third

line, 47% after fourth line), there was a constant reduction
in median duration of response with successive courses:
from 2.7 years after the first, to 1.3 years after the fifth
different therapeutic approach. Globally, 53 (44%)
patients of our entire study population presented at least
1 progression/relapse and, particularly, there is a real selected
subgroup of HCL patients with multirelapsed disease.
Although a substantial number of patients have
remained disease-free for a prolonged period of time, >1/3
eventually relapsed. Retreatment with purine analogues is
associated with a high response rate; however, the relapsefree survival curve does not appear to reach a plateau, and
some patients become refractory to this class of agents.
Recently, monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins have
emerged as a useful strategy for patients who have relapsed
or refractory HCL.21-25 The real need is to maximize
primary responses to prolong remissions. Patients who
have a complete hematological remission are frequently
found to have minimal residual disease by immunohistochemical and immunophenotypic studies. Few preliminary data have reported that the combined use of
rituximab after a purine nucleoside analogue, or given
concomitantly with these agents, may produce a higher
percentage of CR without evidence of residual disease and
cumulative toxicity.26-28 This chemotherapy-immunotherapy combination could increase the economic implications but, at the same time, in terms of cost/benefit
balance, it is important to evaluate this aspect over a long
period of time, because it could potentially be possible to
reduce the number of further treatments for the patients.
There is a need for continued study in this field to
better define the optimal therapeutic regimen. Duration
of therapy, optimal dose and schedule of drug administration, and the need for additional biologic or immunologic
agents should be investigated. In those patients with
resistant or relapsed disease, we also need to explore new
agents as well as targeted immunotoxin conjugates.
