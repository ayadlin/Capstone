ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is one of the most common cancer among women in the world,
and chemotherapy remains the principal treatment for patients. However, drug
resistance is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of ovarian cancers and the
underlying mechanism is not clear. An increased understanding of the mechanisms
that underline the pathogenesis of drug resistance is therefore needed to develop
novel therapeutics and diagnostic. Herein, we report the comparative analysis of the
doxorubicin sensitive OVCAR8 cells and its doxorubicin-resistant variant NCI/ADRRES cells using integrated global proteomics and N-glycoproteomics. A total of 1525
unique N-glycosite-containing peptides from 740 N-glycoproteins were identified
and quantified, of which 253 N-glycosite-containing peptides showed significant
change in the NCI/ADR-RES cells. Meanwhile, stable isotope labeling by amino acids
in cell culture (SILAC) based comparative proteomic analysis of the two ovarian
cancer cells led to the quantification of 5509 proteins. As about 50% of the identified
N-glycoproteins are low-abundance membrane proteins, only 44% of quantified
unique N-glycosite-containing peptides had corresponding protein expression ratios.
The comparison and calibration of the N-glycoproteome versus the proteome classified
14 change patterns of N-glycosite-containing peptides, including 8 up-regulated
N-glycosite-containing peptides with the increased glycosylation sites occupancy,
35 up-regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides with the unchanged glycosylation
sites occupancy, 2 down-regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides with the
decreased glycosylation sites occupancy, 46 down-regulated N-glycosite-containing
peptides with the unchanged glycosylation sites occupancy. Integrated proteomic
and N-glycoproteomic analyses provide new insights, which can help to unravel the
relationship of N-glycosylation and multidrug resistance (MDR), understand the
mechanism of MDR, and discover the new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

INTRODUCTION

the American Cancer Society [1]. Currently, chemotherapy
plays a pivotal role in the treatment of ovarian cancer
patients treated with survey. Among chemotherapeutic
agents, doxorubicin, also known as adriamycin, which
belongs to the anthracycline antibiotic, is one of the most
commonly used drugs in the treatment of ovarian cancer

Ovarian cancer is one of the most commonly
diagnosed malignant tumors that threaten the health of
women. A total of 22,280 new cases and 14,240 deaths that
will occur in the United States in 2016 are estimated by

and other solid tumors [2]. Cancer cells always develop
resistance to doxorubicin after the plentiful and permanent
clinical application of this drug in cancer treatment. Tumor
cells become resistant not only to the drug used but also
to a great variety of structurally and functionally unrelated
compounds as long as they develop drug resistance. MDR
is a major problem towards the successful treatment
of ovarian cancer and the main cause of the failure of
chemotherapy [3, 4]. To date, several theories have been
proposed to account for the development of MDR such as
increased drug efflux and DNA damage repair, reduced
drug uptake, altered drug target expression and resistance
to apoptosis [5, 6]. However, the underlying mechanisms
of MDR in human ovarian cancer are still not completely
elucidated.
Glycosylation, one of the most important and
complex post-translational modifications in nature [7],
plays an important role during molecular and cellular
recognition and communication [8], especially in
cancer progression [9] and immune responses [10, 11].
One mechanism of MDR is to increase drug efflux by
overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters,
such as multidrug resistant protein (P-glycoprotein/
ABCB1) [12, 13]. multidrug resistance-associated protein
1 (MRP1/ABCC1) [14–16], and breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP/ABCG2) [17–19]. All transporters are
N-linked glycosylated membrane glycoproteins. Aberrant
glycosylation is known to be associated with various
human diseases [20]. Recently, a number of studies focused
on identifying the correlation between glycosylation of
glycoproteins that are expressed specifically in tumor cells
and chemoresistance [21–24]. Wojtowicz et al. showed
that inhibition of protein N-glycosylation reverses the
MDR phenotypes of cancer cell lines [25]. Zou et al.
found that 15 proteins included ABCB1 as well as a set of
novel glycoproteins such as CTSD, FKBP10 and SLC2A1
associated with chemoresistance in leukemia cells. Fan et
al identified and quantified 11 membrane N-glycoproteins
which are significantly changed in MDR gastric cancer
cells and they are helpful for better interpreting the
sophisticated mechanisms of MDR in gastric cancer [22].
Di Michele et al screened the differential expressed
glycoproteins between drug sensitive and resistant cell
lines and found 4 glycoproteins remarkably upregulated
in drug resistant cells as putative biomarkers for paclitaxel
resistance in ovarian cancer [24]. These studies have
demonstrated the N-glycosylation alterations in the drug
resistant cancer cell lines compared to the drug sensitive
cancer cell lines, but systematic and comprehensive
information is still unavailable on the correlation of
N-glycosylation with multidrug resistance.
In this study, Hydrophilic interaction liquid
chromatography (HILIC) based enrichment combining
with SILAC labeling strategy was established, optimized
and used to compare the differences of N-glycosylation
level between OVCAR8, a common ovarian cancer cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

line and the doxorubicin-resistant cell line NCI-ADR/RES,
which is derived from OVCAR8 by continuous in vitro
exposure to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin. The
significantly changed N-glycoproteins and N-glycosites
have been found, which might be related to MDR. This
will be helpful to understand the mechanisms of MDR.

RESULTS
Evaluation of the optimized HILIC based
enrichment method for N-linked glycopeptides
Three equal aliquots of 600 μg proteins from mouse
brain tissue, NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR8 cells were
digested using trypsin respectively, and used to optimize
the HILIC based enrichment method for N-glycopeptides,
and evaluate the enrichment efficiency and specificity. In
mouse brain, LC-MC/MS analysis identified 1542, 1356
and 1507 high confidence N-glycosites in triplicates.
49.5% of the N-glycosites were identified in all the
three replicates, and nearly 74% of the N-glycosites
were identified at least twice in the three replicates
(Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1A), A
total of 1957 N-glycosites were identified, covering most
of the N-glycosites in mouse brain which were found
in the previous study [26]. Furthermore, the enrichment
specificity was 86.9%, 87.5% and 84.9% of each single
run separately. To be our knowledge, this should be the
highest enrichment specificity for HILIC-based enrichment
reported so far (Supplementary Table 2). The similar
results were also obtained from OVCAR8 and NCI/ADRRES cells (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary
Figure 1B and 1C). All of the above results demonstrated
that our methods had a good stability, reproducibility, high
enrichment specificity, and that the data set was highly
confident.

N-glycoproteomic analyses of OVCAR8 and
NCI/ADR-RES cells
Figure 1 shows the workflow for the integrated
comparative analyses of global proteome and
N-glycoproteome of OVCAR8 and its doxorubicin-resistant
NCI/ADR-RES cells. To obtain reliable quantitative results,
SILAC experiments were conducted in quadruplicate,
including two forward and two reverse labeling experiments.
For the comparative N-glycoproteomic analysis, a total
of 12 samples, three equal amounts of tryptic peptides
in each SILAC labeling experiment were enriched for
N-glycopeptides by HILIC, removed N-glycans by
PNGase F, and analyzed on LC-MS/MS. A total of 1550
N-glycosites were identified, which mapped to 749 protein
groups (Supplementary Table 5A). The average Andromeda
score of the best identified N-glycosite-containing peptides
was 108 and the average localization probability of the
glycosylation site to a single amino acid was 98.9%.
13414

Oncotarget

N-glycosites with a localization probability greater than
0.75 (class Ι sites) and a score difference greater than
5.0 to the next best matching peptide were chosen. Our
analyses resulted in 1525 very high confidence sites
mapped to 740 protein groups with average localization
probability of 99.6%, including 1296, 1332, 1283 and 1197
N-glycosites identified in two forward and two reverse
SILAC experiments separately (Supplementary Table 5B).
67.9% of the N-glycosites were identified in all the four
replicates (Supplementary Figure 2) and 86.0% (1312
sites) of the N-glycosites were quantified with at least
two valid ratios (Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary
Table 5C), indicating a good reproducibility and precision
of our quantitative strategy. The spontaneous asparagine
(Asn) deamidation has been reported previously [27, 28].
Therefore, we performed an additional control to determine
the false positive assignment of N-glycosites. Aliquots of
enriched glycopeptides were analyzed directly by LC-MS/
MS without PNGase F treatment. Potential false positives
were assigned to the samples without PNGase F only if the
deamidated Asn was found to be part of the N-linked motif
(N-!P-S/T/C). A total of 2 peptides containing deamidated
Asn residues and satisfying the N-X-S/T/C sequon were
identified (Supplementary Table 6), giving rise to a 0.13%
false discovery rate. The false positive rates correlated
closely with the enrichment specificities. Due to the high
specificities in this study, few non-glycopeptides containing
Asn residues were present in the samples, and even fewer
contained the N-!P-S/T/C motif. So these N-glycosites
which we obtained using our optimized IP-ZIC-HILIC

method are highly confident. Finally, 1525 very high
confidence N-glycosites were used in further qualitative
analysis and 1312 N-glycosites with a minimum of two
valid ratios were used in further quantitative analysis.
In the qualitative analysis, we totally identified 1525
unique N-glycosites that matched with the N-glycosylation
consensus sequence motif (N-X-S/T/C; X≠P) [29–31]. To
be specific, 58.2% (888 sites) of the glycosites match the
N-X-T motif, 40.6% (619 sites) of the glycosites match
the N-X-S motif and 1.2% (18 sites) of the glycosites
match the N-X-C motif (Figure 2A). Notably, Threonine
occurs more frequently (1.4-fold) than serine at the second
position. The website-based programs Motif-X [32] and
WebLogo were used to characterize the motif of identified
N-glycosylation sites. These results are in agreement with
previous reports [26].
Matching our data set to the UniProtKB database
(release in 2015.10) shows that among the 740
N-glycoproteins we identified, 54.2% (401 proteins) are
annotated as glycoproteins, and the rest of 339 proteins are
indicated as novel. Figure 2B shows the distribution of the
number of N-glycosylation sites identified per protein. 386
glycoproteins were identified with a single N-glycosite,
and 18 glycoproteins were identified with more than seven
N-glycosites. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related
protein 1 (LRP1), which plays a vital role in endocytosis
and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, was identified with
the maximum of 18 N-glycosites. Lysosome associated
membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) and Lysosome
associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2), which

forward labeling experiments, equal amounts of protein obtained from “heavy labeled” NCI/ADR-RES and “light labeled” OVCAR8
cells were combined and followed by in-solution tryptic digestion. Mixed labeled peptide samples were then separated into two aliquots.
One aliquot was enriched for glycosite-containing peptides using HILIC and the other aliquot was used for high pH reverse phase C18
fractionation followed by the analysis of global protein expression. Finally, LC-MS/MS analysis of peptides were performed using a
LC-MS/MS system. In reverse labeling experiments, “heavy labeled” OVCAR8 and “light labeled” NCI/ADR-RES cells were treated in
parallel using procedures same to those described above. Forward labeling and reverse labeling experiments were conducted twice using
independent biological replicates.

implicates in tumor cell metastasis, were identified with
12 and 9 N-glycosites separately.
To obtain a general overview of the cellular
component, molecular function, and biological processes
of these identified glycoproteins, we used Cytoscape and
BiNGO to determine Gene Ontology (GO) categories
overrepresented in the 740 protein groups compared to the
entire human proteome. A GOSlim Generic assignment
provided an initial overview of the GO distribution
(Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 7A). About 56% of
the glycoproteome was in the “plasma membrane” GO
category (p = 0.00E+00, 723 of 740 protein groups with
GO annotation). Moreover, proteins associated with
the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome,
endosome and vacuole were also highly overrepresented
(p < 6.20E-20)(Figure 3B, Supplementary Table 7B).
Molecular function categories which are enriched in our
dataset include receptor activity, transporter activity,
receptor binding and carbohydrate binding (p < 5.46E 05).
These functions are known to be characteristics of
glycoproteins and correlate with their extracellular location
(Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 7C). The glycoproteome
were enriched in many biological processes, that play
vital roles in the development of chemoresistance and
cancer progression, including cell adhesion, migration,
development and differentiation (p < 9.88E-38), response
to external stimuli (p < 1.93E-40) and multicellular
organismal processes (p < 2.63E-88) (Figure 3D,
Supplementary Table 7D).
In the quantitative analysis of N-glycositecontaining peptides, two fold differences were chosen as
the threshold for high significance. With these criteria,
114 N-glycosite-containing peptides were observed
significantly down-regulated and 139 N-Linked glycositecontaining peptides were observed significantly upregulated in doxorubicin-resistant NCI/ADR-RES cells
compared with OVCAR8 cells (Figure 4A). Among the

253 significantly changed N-glycosite-containing peptides,
226 of them (89%) are annotated to be glycosylated in
the UniprotKB database (release in 2015.10), including
127 predicted or based on similarity, and confirmed in our
study (Figure 4B, Supplementary Table 8). A total of 165
glycoproteins with 253 significantly changed N-glycosites
were analyzed using the PANTHE software [33–35] and
UniProtKB database to acquire the information of their
functions. Most of these glycoproteins were related to
substance metabolism, cell apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell
signaling, receptors and transport, indicating that multiple
pathways are involved in doxorubicin resistance in ovarian
cancer cells (Figure 4C, Supplementary Table 9).

Global proteomic analysis in OVCAR8 and NCI/
ADR-RES cells
At the same time, we also systematically compared
the proteome of OVCAR8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells
(Figure 1).
SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analyses led
to identification of 7101 protein groups with at least one
unique peptide identified per protein (Supplementary
Table 10A) and quantification of 5509 protein groups
with at least two valid ratios were considered for
further analysis (Supplementary Table 10B). 76% of the
protein groups were identified in all the four replicates
(Supplementary Figure 4), and 78% of the protein
groups were quantified availably at least twice in the four
replicates (Supplementary Figure 5), demonstrating a good
reproducibility and accuracy in LC-MS/MS analysis. The
mean value of 5509 protein groups quantitative ratios
was 1.11 and SD value was 0.20, indicating expression
level of most of proteins were unchanged, thus two fold
differences were considered to be significant changes of
protein expression. Drawing on these criteria, 169 protein
groups were down-regulated and 125 protein groups were

up-regulated in NCI/ADR-RES cells (Figure 4D). In
addition, the accuracy of SILAC-based quantification was
validated using western blot. Western blot analysis of OAT,
PHB, VDAC1, ATP5B and HINT2 expression in the two
cell lines displayed very good consistency with SILACbased quantification results (Supplementary Figure 6).
Above quantified 5509 proteins include 449
annotated glycoproteins and 70 glycosyltransferases.
Among the 449 glycoproteins, 18 glycoproteins including
multidrug resistance protein 1 (ABCB1), semaphorin-3D
(SEMA3D), transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC)
and integrin beta-4 (ITGB4) were up-regulated, and
25 glycoproteins were down-regulated at the protein
expression level in NCI/ADR-RES cells compared with
OVCAR8 cells (Supplementary Table 11).

identified in both proteome and N-glycoproteome.
There are 259 proteins identified in both proteome
N-glycoproteome. Remarkably, 481 proteins were
only identified by their N-glycosylated peptides in
the N-glycoproteome. Most soluble and membranebound proteins expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum,
including secreted proteins, surface receptors and ligands
and organelle-resident proteins, were glycosylated to
some extent. Nevertheless, their relatively low abundance
makes them more difficult to detect in the proteome. This
indicated that some low abundant membrane proteins were
enriched and identified using N-glycoproteomic approach.
This is also supported by the fact that the intensities
of de-glycopeptides of proteins only identified in the
N-glycoproteome experiment are shifted to low intensity
values compared with those where the corresponding
proteins were also identified in the global proteome data
set (Figure 5B).
Mass spectrometry (MS) based quantitative
proteomic techniques have been widely used in
simultaneous identification and relative quantification of
post-translational modification (PTM) events [36–39].
Though such studies have provided insight into PTM

The proteome versus the N-glycoproteome
In order to investigate how the abundance of
N-glycosite compares to that of proteins, we compared
datasets of the quantified N-glycoproteome (N-glycositecontaining peptides and proteins) and the proteome.

dynamics, we need to interpret the quantitative data
carefully because differential abundances of PTM’s
peptides represent not only changes in PTM’s status,
but also modified expression of substrate proteins.
Recently, researchers tried to decipher the roles of protein
abundances playing in the PTM’s peptide quantitative
data, especially focused on glycosylation [40, 41] and
phosphorylation events [42–45]. Gygi et al. reported that
correct interpretation of comprehensive phosphorylation
dynamics requires normalization by protein expression
changes, and he showed an obviously different view, with
25% of seemingly differential phosphopeptides attributed
to changes in protein expression [46].
To evaluate the effect of protein normalization
on measured glycosylation changes, we focused on
the N-glycoproteins quantified in both proteome and
N-glycoproteome, and compared the quantitative
N-glycoproteomic ratios of 570 N-glycosites which
mapped to 208 proteins, and the ratios in protein
expression level after filtering with at least two valid
ratio values (Supplementary Table 12). The ratios of the
N-glycosites against protein ratios correlate well (Pearson
r = 0.84), indicating that changes in N-glycosylation of a

protein are usually a reflection of the change of protein
abundance. However, protein ratios were located within a
range of ±1 (log2 scale) and glycosylation site ratios were
outside the –1 and +1 interval at the same time suggesting
significant changes in the glycosylation occupancy of
these proteins (Figure 6).
To be specific, in order to obtain the actual
glycosylation change of every protein, 570 N-glycosites
were classified into 14 patterns according to N-glycosites
ratio, protein ratio and calibrated N-glycosites ratio (so
called N-glycosites occupancy) (Figure 7). Briefly, the
570 N-glycosites were firstly grouped into three major
categories based on N-glycosites ratio: up-regulated
(≥ 2.0)，down-regulated (≤ 0.5) and unchanged (0.5–2.0).
Within each category, the N-glycosites were further sorted
into different subcategories according to their protein
expression ratio and calibrated N-glycosites ratio. Pattern
1 (P1)，pattern 3 (P3) and pattern 5 (P5) displayed that
N-glycosite-containing peptides were significantly upregulated before and after calibration, indicating that these
N-glycosite-containing peptides changes were indeed
resulted from increased N-glycosylation occupancy. In
P3, for example, actually up-regulated N-glycosylation

provided additional information on interpreting the
role of ATP6AP1 in drug resistance of cancers. [47, 48]
Pattern 2 (P2), pattern 4 (P4), pattern 13 (P13) and pattern
14 (P14) showed that the significantly up- or down-

regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides were found
unchanged N-glycosite occupancy after calibration using
protein expression ratios. In P2, both of N-glycosylation
level of ABCB1 at Asn99 and its protein expression
were extremely up-regulated, and the actual N-glycosite

occupancy at Asn99 was unchanged after calibration,
so the effect of ABCB1 glycosylation on its drug efflux
activity needs to be validated by more studies [12, 49–52].
Pattern 6 (P6), pattern 9 (P9) and pattern 10 (P10) revealed
that these significantly changed N-glycosite-containing
peptides with unchanged N-glycosite occupancy. Pattern
7 (P7), pattern 8 (P8) and pattern 11 (P11) showed that
458 N-glycosite-containing peptides had unchanged
N-glycosylation level and N-glycosite occupancy. The
representative N-glycosite-containing peptides and their
classification were listed in Table 1.

analysis and 1525 unique N-glycosite-containing peptides
from 740 N-glycoproteins were identified and quantified
in the N-glycoproteomic analysis. Some low abundant
glycosylated membrane proteins were identified and
quantified in the N-glycoproteomic analysis, but they
were not identified in the global proteomic analysis.
The reason is that the glycopeptides from the low
abundant membrane proteins have been enriched in the
N-glycoproteome analysis. So in total, about 44% (570 of
1312) of unique N-glycosite-containing peptides quantified
in N-glycoproteome analysis obtained their corresponding
protein ratios from the proteomic analysis. Even so, we are
still able to focus on the 570 N-glycosylated sites from 208
proteins, which were quantified in both N-glycoproteomic
and proteomic analyses, and compare their N-glycosylation
ratios, protein ratios and the calibrated N-glycosylation
ratios, also called N-glycosite occupancy (N-glycosylation
ratio/protein ratio). The 570 N-glycosites were classified
into 14 patterns according to N-glycosites ratio, protein
ratio and calibrated N-glycosites ratio.
As expected, N-glycosylation as a largely
cotranslational and stable modification, most of
the changes in glycoproteins observed at specific
N-glycosites were a reflection of the change of protein
abundance. However, in some cases, the changes in the
N-glycosylation level and the protein level could not
maintain consistency. For example, ABCC5, one member
of the ABC superfamily, is a multidrug-resistanceassociated protein 5, which is related to the drug efflux of

DISCUSSION
OVCAR8 and its doxorubicin-resistant NCI/ADRRES cells have been used models to study the mechanisms
of multidrug resistance. Our previous study has compared
the differentially expressed mitochondria proteome between
OVCAR8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells using SILAC-based
quantitative proteomic strategy, and several annotated
glycoproteins, such as multidrug resistant protein, fukutinrelated protein, adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L2
and CXADR-like membrane protein, have been found upregulated in doxorubicin-resistant NCI/ADR-RES cells [53].
In this study, we have provided the most comprehensive
comparative proteomic and N-glycoproteomic analyses
of OVCAR8 and its doxorubicin-resistant NCI/ADRRES cells. A total of 7101 protein groups were identified
and 5509 protein groups were quantified in the proteomic

multidrug resistance of cancer cells [54–56]. In this study,
ABCC5 protein was up-regulated in the N-glycosylation
level at Asn897 and unchanged in its protein expression
level in the NCI/ADR-RES cells compared with the
OVCAR8 cells, where no significant changes were
measured in the global expression of the same protein. This
study indicated that an overall increase of N-glycosylation
occupancy of ABCC5 in drug-resistant NCI/ADR-RES
cells. The up-regulated N-glycosylation level of ABCC5
could play a significant role in multidrug resistance of
ovarian cancer, but this hypothesis needs to be validated
by further studies. Furthermore, P-gp1, the protein
product of the ABCB1 (multidrug resistance protein 1), is
also responsible for pumping doxorubicin out of cells to
reduce the accumulation of doxorubicin in cells [57] and
protecting resistant tumor cells from caspase-dependent
apoptosis in the mitochondria [58], thus accounting for
drug resistance. Here, P-gp1 was found simultaneously upregulated in the N-glycosylation at Asn99 at a SILAC ratio
of 92.41 ± 59.54 and in the expression level at a SILAC
ratio of 56.46 ± 29.53 in NCI/ADR-RES cells compared
to OVCAR8 cells. This indicated that both of the upregulated N-glycosylation level and expression level of
P-gp1 are related to multidrug resistance of ovarian cancer.

and L-[12C6, 14N2]-lysine (Lys0), and NCI/ADR-RES cells
were labeled with heavy amino acids by growing them
in RPMI 1640 medium containing L-[13C6, 15N4]-arginine
(Arg10) and L-[13C6, 15N2]-lysine (Lys8) instead of the
natural amino acids. For reverse labeling, the OVCAR8
cells were grown in heavy SILAC medium, and NCI/
ADR-RES cells were grown in light SILAC medium.
Labeled amino acids were purchased from Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). For SILAC cell
culture, cells were grown for at least six passages in the
SILAC medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to
achieve complete isotope incorporation (> 96%).
NCI/ADR-RES cells, which were originally thought
to be derived from a MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, were
later validated to be derived from OVCAR8 ovarian
adenocarcinoma cells [59]. Measurement of doxorubicin
resistance by MTT analysis in OVCAR8 and NCI/ADRRES cells was described previously [53].

Protein extraction and digestion
Cells were washed three times with cold PBS
and then harvested using a cell scraper in lysis buffer
(8M urea, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) containing Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
The lysates were sonicated and the supernatant was
carefully collected after centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4°C
for 10 min. The concentration of proteins was determined
by Bradford assay. Extracted protein samples from
heavy labeled NCI/ADR-RES cells and light labeled
OVCAR8 cells in forward SILAC labeling, light labeled
NCI/ADR-RES cells and heavy labeled OVCAR8 cells
in reverse SILAC labeling were combined at a 1:1 ratio
separately. In-solution digestion was performed with the
following protocol. Protein mixtures were reduced with
10 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37°C for one hour,
subsequently alkylated in 40 mM iodoacetamide (IAM)
for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and then Lys-C
was added and digested at 37°C for 6 hours. After diluting
the concentration of urea to 1M with 25 mM NH4HCO3,
sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was
added at an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:50 and digested at
37°C overnight. Digestion was stopped by adding formic
acid to a final concentration of 1‰. The digested peptide
mixtures were collected by centrifugation at 14, 000 g for
10 min. All digested products were desalted on Waters
Oasis® HLB solid phase extraction columns.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the established HILIC based
enrichment method for N-linked glycopeptides are of
a good stability, reproducibility and high enrichment
specificity. Integrated proteomic and N-glycoproteomic
analyses of doxorubicin sensitive and resistant ovarian cells
provide the glycoprotein alteration in protein abundance,
glycosylation level and N-glycosylation occupancy, which
can help to unravel the relationship of N-glycosylation and
MDR, understand the mechanism of MDR, and discover
the new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and SILAC labeling
The human ovarian tumor cell line OVCAR8
and its doxorubicin resistant subline NCI/ADR-RES
were gifts from Dr. Xiaoyuan (Shawn) Chen of the
National Institutes of Health (NCI/ADR-RES is verified
as a multidrug resistance cell line by Dr. Chen group
[53]). OVCAR8 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL
streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 at 37°C. Culture condition for NCI/ADR-RES
cells were identical with OVCAR8 cells except that the
concentration of L-glutamine was 5 mM.
For forward SILAC labeling, OVCAR8 cells were
labeled with light amino acid by growing them in RPMI
1640 medium containing L-[12C6, 14N4]-arginine (Arg0)

The establishment, optimization and
evaluation of hydrophilic interaction liquid
chromatography (HILIC) based enrichment
method for the N-linked glycopeptides
Enrichment was performed on a RIGOL L-3000
Series HPLC system (including L-3120 solvent organizer,
L-3220 binary pump, L-3320 autosampler with a 100 µL
13423

Oncotarget

sample loop, L-3400 column oven, and L-3500 UV-VIS
detector). The HILIC-based enrichment method for the
N-linked glycopeptides was established, optimized and
evaluated using mouse brain tissue sample, OVCAR8
and NCI/ADR-RES cells samples separately. About 200
μg FASP [60] based tryptic digested peptide mixture was
dissolved in 100 µL 60% ACN and injected into Ultimate®
HILIC Amphion column (4.6×100 mm, 5 μm, 120 Å,
Welch Materials (Shanghai), Inc.). The column was eluted
using mobile phase A (0.1% TFA in water) and mobile
phase B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) with a gradient (80% B,
0–20 min; 80–2% B, 20–21 min; 2% B, 21–30 min;
2–80% B, 30–30.1 min; 80% B, 30.1–38 min) at a flow
rate of 0.7 mL/min. The glycopeptides containing fractions
were detected at 214 nm and collected from 20 to 30 min.
The glycopeptides containing fractions were dried under
vacuum, then resuspended in 50 µL 50 mM NH4HCO3
and deglycosylated with PNGase F at 3°C for 2.5 h and
dried again for LC-MS/MS analysis. The specificity of
the enrichment for N-glycopeptides was calculated using
the number of identified N-glycopeptides divided by the
number of total peptides identified.
The SILAC labeled and combined peptide mixture
from NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR8 cells was performed
the enrichment for N-glycopeptides using the above
optimized method and deglycosylated with PNGase
F at 37°C for direct LC-MS/MS analysis without
fractionation. To evaluate the chemical deamidation in
sample processing, we incubated the same SILAC labeled
peptide mixture enriched as above described at 37°C
without PNGase F in NH4HCO3 buffer. The samples were
then analyzed by LC-MS/MS in parallel.

LC-MS/MS analysis

Fractionation of peptides using high-pH HPLC
for quantitative proteomic analysis

The N-glycoproteome and the proteome
raw data were analyzed using MaxQuant software
(version 1.5.2.8) against UniportKB human database
(downloaded on October 15, 2015) with 92,013 entries.
For N-glycoproteome analysis, the parameters were set
as follows: Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a
fixed modification and N-terminal acetylation, methionine
oxidation and asparagine deamidation were set as variable
modifications. Leucines were replaced by isoleucines.
Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin allowing N-terminal
cleavage to proline. False discovery rate, determined by
using a reversed database, was set to 0.01 for peptide,
modification site and protein identifications. The minimum
required peptide length was set to seven amino acids
per identified peptides and two missed cleavages were
allowed. The precursor and fragment ion maximum mass
tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively.
Proteins with at least one unique peptide were considered
as valid identifications. Deamidation at asparagine was
applied as a variable modification to identify N-glycosites
of formerly glycosylated peptides and N-linked glycositecontaining peptides were required to contain N-!P-S/T/C

LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on EASY-nLC
1000 HPLC coupled with Q Exactive mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific). Lyophilized peptides samples were
resuspended in 0.1% FA and loaded onto a reverse-phase
C18 in-house packed trap column (100 μm ID × 2 cm,
5  μm, Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ, Dr. Maisch GmbH,
Germany) and then separated on a reversed-phase C18 in
house packed analytical column (75 μm ID×20 cm, 3 μm,
Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) using
mobile phase A (0.1% FA in water) and mobile phase B
(0.1% FA in acetonitrile) with a gradient (5–8% B, 8 min;
8–22% B, 50 min; 22–32% B, 12 min; 32–95% B, 1 min;
95% B, 7 min) at a flow rate of 280 nL/min. The mass
spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with
data-dependent acquisition mode. Full scan MS spectra
(from m/z 300 to 1600) were acquired in the Orbitrap at
a high resolution of 70,000 (m/z 200) with an automatic
gain control (AGC) of 3×106 and a maximum injection
time of 60 ms. The top 20 precursor ions were selected
from each MS full scan with isolation width of 2 m/z in
the HCD collision cell with normalized collision energy
of 27%. Subsequently, MS/MS spectra were acquired in
the Orbitrap with a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. The
target value was 5 × 104 with a maximum injection time
of 80 ms. Ions selected for MS/MS were dynamically
excluded for a duration of 40s. For nano electrospray ion
source setting: the spray voltage was 2.0 kV, no sheath gas
flow, the heated capillary temperature was 320°C. All raw
data were viewed in Xcalibur v2.2.

Data analysis

Fractionation of peptide mixture was performed
using a RIGOL L-3000 Series HPLC system. About 50 µg
peptide mixture was dissolved in 100 µL water (0.1%
ammonium hydroxide), then injected into a Xbridge®
Peptide BEH C18 column (2.1×150 mm, 3.5 μm, 130 Å,
Waters Corporation) and then eluted using mobile phase A
(0.1% ammonium hydroxide in water, pH 10) and mobile
phase B (0.1% ammonium hydroxide in acetonitrile, pH 10)
with a gradient (5–8% B, 0–5 min; 8–18% B, 5–40 min;
18–32% B, 40–62 min; 32–95% B, 62–64 min; 95–95% B,
64–68 min; 95–5% B, 68–69 min; 5–5% B, 69–76 min)
at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Peptides were detected at
214 nm, 48 fractions were collected along with the LCseparation in a time-based mode from 3 to 75 min and then
concatenated into 12 fractions by combining fractions 1,
13, 25, 37; 2, 14, 26, 38, etc. The combined fractions were
then dried under vacuum and stored at –80°C until LCMS/MS analysis.

Proteins were extracted from OVCAR8 and NCI/
ADR-RES cells as described above. Equal amounts
of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes by semi-dry methods,
which were then incubated with primary antibodies after
blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat
milk. The immunoreactive protein bands were detected
with super-enhanced chemiluminescence substrate after
incubating with secondary antibodies. Western blot
analyses for all selected proteins were repeated three times
and GAPDH was used as loading control.
