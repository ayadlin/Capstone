ABSTRACT
Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive primary pediatric bone tumor, often diagnosed in
adolescents and young adults. A pathognomonic reciprocal chromosomal translocation
results in a fusion gene coding for a protein which derives its N-terminus from a FUS/
EWS/TAF15 (FET) protein family member, commonly EWS, and C-terminus containing
the DNA-binding domain of an ETS transcription factor, commonly FLI1. Nearly 85% of
cases express the EWS-FLI protein which functions as a transcription factor and drives
oncogenesis. As the primary genomic lesion and a protein which is not expressed
in normal cells, disrupting EWS-FLI function is an attractive therapeutic strategy
for Ewing sarcoma. However, transcription factors are notoriously difficult targets
for the development of small molecules. Improved understanding of the oncogenic
mechanisms employed by EWS-FLI to hijack normal cellular programming has
uncovered potential novel approaches to pharmacologically block EWS-FLI function.
In this review we examine targeting the chromatin regulatory enzymes recruited to
conspire in oncogenesis with a focus on the histone lysine specific demethylase 1
(LSD1). LSD1 inhibitors are being aggressively investigated in acute myeloid leukemia
and the results of early clinical trials will help inform the future use of LSD1 inhibitors
in sarcoma. High LSD1 expression is observed in Ewing sarcoma patient samples and
mechanistic and preclinical data suggest LSD1 inhibition globally disrupts the function
of EWS-ETS proteins.

INTRODUCTION

event-free survival rates nearing 75% for patients with
localized disease, however those presenting with overt
metastasis (seen in 20-30% of patients at diagnosis) or
recurrent disease have poor outcomes, with under 30%
disease-free survival [4, 5]. Furthermore, successful
chemotherapeutic regimes are associated with significant
cumulative and late toxicities [6]. Given the failure of
systemic chemotherapy to improve durable remission rates
for patients with metastatic disease, translation of novel
therapeutic strategies to increase overall survival rates
remains imperative.
Several challenges persist in the development of
targeted therapies for Ewing sarcoma. Although advances
in next generation sequencing have augmented our

First described by James Ewing in 1921 as “diffuse
endothelioma of bone,” Ewing sarcoma is the third
most common malignant bone neoplasia diagnosed in
children and adolescents [1, 2]. While the histogenesis
of Ewing sarcoma remains enigmatic, 85% of cases
are defined by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal
translocation, resulting in a pathognomonic chimeric
fusion gene, EWSR1-FLI1, which encodes the EWS-FLI
protein [3]. Treatment protocols continue to rely upon
conventional multidisciplinary approaches coupling
intensive chemotherapy with surgery and/or radiotherapy.

understanding of disease mechanisms driven by EWSFLI, the cell-of-origin is unknown. Large-scale genomic
sequencing efforts have demonstrated Ewing sarcoma
possesses one of the lowest mutation rates amongst all
cancers (0.15 mutations/Mb) [7, 8], yielding a paucity of
pharmacologically actionable mutations. Indeed, Ewing
sarcoma tumor samples showed recurrent, though low
frequency, mutations only in the cohesin complex subunit
STAG2 (21.5%), the tumor suppressor TP53 (6.2%) and
homozygous deletion of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor CDKN2A (13.8%) [7]. It appears possible Ewing
sarcoma cells require large-scale epigenetic alteration
to maintain malignant programming which disrupts
normal developmental processes [9-15]. Notably, EWSFLI blocks mesenchymal differentiation and promotes
neuronal programs, which is in turn, dampened by
EWSR1 and REST [13, 16]. Morphological studies
suggest Ewing sarcoma cells strike a delicate balance
between proliferative growth and metastatic capacity
along the mesenchymal differentiation axis [17]. The
transcription factor ZEB2 is critical to block expression
of genes characteristic of an epithelial lineage [18].
Taken together, the oncogenic interplay of EWS-FLI with
varied developmental pathways is marked by complexity.
If Ewing sarcoma is to be placed within a Waddington
landscape, perhaps it is best categorized as lost in the
wilderness.
The importance of epigenomic misregulation in
cancer and development of pharmacological tools to probe
epigenetic mechanisms have advanced significantly in the
past decade. However, the field faces technical hurdles in
both collecting data and approaching the complexity in
gathered data. Ewing sarcoma and other mutationally quiet
pediatric malignancies have emerged as interesting model
systems to further probe epigenetic aberrations conspiring
in oncogenesis [7, 8, 19-21]. EWS-FLI expression affects
the transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome to reprogram
cells into a malignant developmental limbo [7, 8, 2237]. Conversely, several studies suggest cellular context,
both epigenetic and otherwise, influences the effects of
EWS-FLI, as enforced expression in animal models leads
to phenotypically variant tumors [38-40]. Moreover,
expression of EWS-FLI in human pediatric mesenchymal
stem cells failed to produce tumors in xenograft models,
despite recapitulation of disease-specific transcriptomic
and epigenomic phenotypes [31]. Rational design and
implementation of improved therapeutic regimens
requires more comprehensive understanding of disease
mechanisms influenced by EWS-FLI and other FET/ETS
fusions. Toward this end, recent work has described the
epigenomic landscape of EWS-FLI in patient-derived
cell lines and primary tumor samples [23, 29, 30, 35].
Additional lines of inquiry have further defined an
important role for EWS-FLI in altering transcript splice
selection [32, 33]. Notably, disruption of either epigenetic
mechanisms or alternative splicing mechanisms delay

tumor growth in xenograft models [22, 33].
Methylation is an important and subtle chemical
modification which regulates chromatin status and
is observed on both DNA and histones. Indeed, the
significance of DNA methylation in both cancer initiation
and progression has been appreciated for a number of
years, resulting in the approval of two agents for the
treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome,
azacitidine/Vidaza [41] (nucleoside analogue) and
decitabine/Dacogen [42], (irreversible inhibitor of DNA
methyltransferase enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3).
Histone methylation, a mechanism to modify chromatin
structure, dynamically regulates cellular processes
including transcription and genomic stability. Until a
decade ago, histone methylation was considered an
immutable modification, defining programs in concert
with DNA methylation and other histone post-translational
modification. However, the discovery of the first histone
demethylase, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in
2004 [43], challenged this notion and proved lysine
methylation is dynamically regulated. LSD1 (also
known as KDM1A, AOF2 and BHC110), is a flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent amine oxidase
with important epigenetic eraser function, specifically
catalyzing oxidative demethylation of mono- and
dimethyl-lysine at histone H3 lysines 4 and 9 (H3K4me1/2
and H3K9me1/2) [43], generating formaldehyde and
hydrogen peroxide. In addition, LSD1 is reported to
demethylate modified lysines on a myriad of non-histone
proteins such as DNMT1 (residue K1096) [44], E2F1
(K185 residue) [45], MYPT1 (residue K442) [46], p53
(K370 residue) [47] and STAT3 (K140 residue) [48].
Importantly, LSD1 activity is highly context dependent.
Several protein interaction partners are reported, including
REST corepressor (CoREST) and MTA2, the nucleosome
remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and nuclear
hormone receptors [49, 50]. As such, the epigenetic effects
of LSD1 are implicated in diverse biologic processes
pertinent to adipogenesis [51], chromosome segregation
[52], cell proliferation [53], embryonic development
[54], epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [55],
hematopoiesis [56, 57], and regulation of stem cell
pluripotency [58].
Owing to its high expression in several solid
malignancies including breast [59-61], colorectal [62,
63], lung [62, 64], ovarian cancer [65], undifferentiated
neuroblastoma [66], prostate carcinoma [67, 68], urothelial
carcinoma [62], and sarcomas (Ewing, chondrosarcoma,
osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial) [69,
70], specific small molecule inhibitors of LSD1 have
been aggressively pursued as potential therapeutics.
Recently, our laboratory demonstrated EWS-FLI mediated
transcriptional repression is facilitated through direct
binding of a NuRD-LSD1 complex [71]. Furthermore,

EWS-FLI and EWS-ERG and significantly delayed
tumorigenesis in vivo [22]. As such, this review will cover
the rationale for LSD1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy
for Ewing sarcoma and the recent advances made by the
scientific and pharmaceutical community to deliver potent
LSD1 inhibitors.

mechanism by which LSD1 achieves this dual substrate
specificity for both H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2 marks
was unclear until recently [86]. An alternatively spliced
isoform of LSD1, LSD1+8a, can specifically demethylate
H3K9me1/2, but not H3K4me1/2. This isoform was
previously reported to be predominantly expressed in
neuronal cell types and is involved in neuronal maturation
[87]. Additional binding of the protein supervilin improved
LSD1 catalytic activity toward H3K9me1/2, suggesting
some interactions may favor specificity for one substrate
over another. The expression of different LSD1 isoforms
remains unexplored in Ewing sarcoma, but constitutes
an important consideration in both cultured cells and
patient-derived samples. Additionally, LSD2/KDM1B is
a homolog of LSD1 (31% sequence similarity), lacking
the tower domain while possessing additional zinc finger
domains. LSD2 specifically acts within the gene bodies of
target genes, displaying distinct localization of function as
compared to LSD1, which acts primarily on promoter and
enhancer regions [88, 89]. Expression of LSD2 in Ewing
sarcoma likewise remains unexplored.
Apart from demethylating histone lysine residues,
LSD1 has multiple non-histone substrates with diverse
cellular functions, including p53, E2F1 and DNMT1.
LSD1-mediated demethylation of p53 at K370me1/2
represses apoptotic activity, revealing a dynamic mode of
p53 regulation [47]. Stabilization of E2F1 in p53-deficient
tumor cells through demethylation at K185 inhibits DNAdamage induced cell death [45]. In an interesting link
between the chromatin and DNA methylation machinery,
LSD1 is critical for the maintenance of global DNA
methylation patterns through regulation of DNMT1
stability during gastrulation in mouse embryos via
demethylation at K1096 [90].

TARGETING HISTONE DEMETHYLATION
IN CANCER
A variety of histone modifications, both written and
erased by specific enzymes, are recognized by chromatin
regulatory complexes to modulate target gene expression
[72]. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) and
lysine 9 (H3K9) is linked to transcriptional activity
at nearby genes [73]. In actively transcribing genes,
H3K4me3 is strongly enriched at the transcription start
site, with H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 peaks more broadly
spread [74]. The methylation state of H3K4 is established
through dynamic and coordinated activities of histone
lysine methyltransferases, such as Set1/COMPASS family
proteins, and histone lysine demethylases, such as FADdependent LSD1 and the JmjC domain containing JARID1
family [43, 75-77]. Notably, histone methylation is
appreciated to function in precise cell- and tissue-specific
manners [78, 79]. This may provide superior opportunities
for therapeutic disruption in cancer, due to improved offtarget profiles as compared to those observed with the use
of histone deacetylase inhibitors [78-82]. LSD1 displays
highly context dependent function, making it an attractive
target to modulate epigenetic misregulation in cancer.
LSD1 demethylates H3K4 and H3K9 as well as
non-histone protein substrates
The core structure of LSD1 comprises three
domains, a small alpha-helical Swi3, RSC8, and MOIRA
(SWIRM) domain and amine oxidase-like (AOL) domain
form a closely packed structure and a protruding tower
domain unique to LSD1 [49, 83]. The crystal structure
of LSD1 shows similarity to other FAD-dependent
oxidases and reveals a large substrate binding cavity
to accommodate several residues of the N-terminal
histone H3, positioning K4 for demethylation. This
binding conformation is critical for the demethylation of
mono- and di-methyl modifications, though the catalytic
mechanism precludes activity against trimethylated lysine.
In contrast to other SWIRM domain-containing proteins
such as ADA2α and Swi3, the SWIRM domain of LSD1
lacks conserved DNA-binding residues, thus requiring
other interaction partners to bind and demethylate native
nucleosomes [83-85]. The tower domain directly protrudes
from the catalytic center and binds LSD1-interacting
proteins such as CoREST, MTA2, and HDAC1/2.
LSD1 was observed to demethylate the H3K9me1/2
marks in association with the androgen receptor,
promoting target gene expression [50]. However, the

WITH
MULTIPROTEIN COMPLEXES REGULATES
FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES
The activity of LSD1 is predominantly in concert
with specific chromatin regulatory complexes found
in distinct cell types and several examples illustrate the
functional specificity conferred through recruitment by
specific factors. LSD1 commonly associates with CoREST
and HDAC1/2 containing complexes for demethylation
of nucleosomal substrates [91, 92]. In breast cancer
cells, LSD1 interacts with MTA2 to forms an essential
component of the NuRD complex containing MTA1/2/3
and HDAC1/2 to regulate key signaling mechanisms,
including TGFβ signaling, involved in cell proliferation,
metastasis and EMT [93]. During embryonic stem cell
differentiation, LSD1 is required for the decommissioning
and silencing of the pluripotency enhancers for normal
differentiation, in cooperation with NuRD components
[94]. Additionally, LSD1 is shown to play a crucial role
in EMT via formation of a ternary Snail1-CoREST-LSD1

cancer, LSD1 expression levels increased considerably
during tumor progression from pre-invasive to invasive
ductal breast carcinoma [60]. Conversely, in urothelial
carcinoma, LSD1 expression levels were significantly
high even in early grade (G1) tumors [62], implying that
LSD1 is involved in tumor initiation for this malignancy.
Wu et al., recently performed a meta-analysis to assess the
association between LSD1 expression and overall survival
in 1,149 cancer patients (hepatocellular carcinoma,
esophageal, colon, breast, melanoma and tongue cancer).
Analysis from nine studies, particularly enriched for
Asian cohorts suggested that LSD1 overexpression was
asso­ciated with poor overall survival, particularly for
esophageal cancer patients (P = 0.000) [107].
Although expression of LSD1 has been evaluated in
a large cohort of sarcomas, there is currently no evidence
supporting the role of LSD1 in sarcoma tumor progression
or disease-free survival. Immunohistochemical staining of
a cohort of 468 sarcomas by Schildhaus et al., reported
pronounced LSD1 expression specifically in highly
malignant tumor groups including synovial sarcomas,
rhabdomyosarcomas, desmoplastic small round cell tumors
and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)
[70]. A subsequent report by Bennani-Baiti confirmed
these findings and extended the high expressing LSD1
sarcoma groups to Ewing sarcoma, chondrosarcoma and
osteosarcoma [69], subtypes which were not investigated
by Schildhaus et al. Although LSD1 expression in Ewing
sarcoma was comparable to that of rhabdomyosarcoma,
the most significant LSD1-expressing sarcoma subtype,
no studies have hitherto to date examined the prognostic
value of LSD1 expression in Ewing sarcoma.

complex, in which LSD1 interacts with the SNAG domain
of Snail1 to regulate target gene expression involved in
the suppression of cell migration and invasion [95]. Other
transcription factors which possess the SNAG domain,
homologous to the N-terminus of histone H3, recruit LSD1
as well. During hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, the
LSD1-CoREST complex is recruited by the SNAG domain
of Gfi-1 to mediate repression of lineage-specific target
genes [96]. The wide range of LSD1 interaction partners
remains beyond the scope of this review. However, LSD1
is critical for execution of various differentiation programs
including adipogenesis, skeletal muscle differentiation
and pituitary organogenesis, highlighting the importance
of histone demethylation in regulating cell-type specific
gene expression patterns [51, 97, 98].
Although LSD1 regulates the expression of several
downstream targets, the upstream regulators of LSD1
have not been extensively studied. miR-137 was shown to
regulate the protein levels of LSD1 in neural cells through
targeting the 3'UTR of LSD1, resulting in negative
regulation of neural cell proliferation and increased neural
differentiation [99]. miR-137 was also shown to be a
tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma by downregulation of
LSD1 [100]. Posttranslational control of LSD1 expression
is dynamically achieved by ubiquitination. Stabilized
levels of LSD1 by deubiquitinase USP28 conferred stem
cell like properties to breast cancer cells [101]. Another
study showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Jade-2 (jade
family PHD finger 2) can negatively regulate LSD1 in
developing mouse cortical neurons and zebrafish embryos
[102]. It remains to be explored whether these regulatory
mechanisms are active in different cancers, including
Ewing sarcoma.

TRANSLATION OF LSD1 INHIBITORS

HIGH LSD1 EXPRESSION PROMOTES CELL
PROLIFERATION AND METASTASIS IN
CANCER

The well-defined active site cavity of LSD1 has
enabled the development of numerous high-affinity
and selective small-molecule inhibitors, reviewed
extensively by Zheng et al., [108] and Mould et al., [109].
Unfortunately, numerous candidates failed to satisfy the
stringent physicochemical and toxicological requirements
for clinical development or were subsequently proven to
possess poor LSD1 specificity profiles. Several peptide
based LSD1 inhibitors (linear and cyclic) have also been
generated [110-112]; however the clinical development
pathway for peptide-based therapeutics remains uncertain.
As single-agent therapy increases the likelihood of
the emergence of resistant cancer cell clones, the ability
of LSD1 inhibitors to synergize with current treatment
regimens will be imperative for their implementation into
standard treatment protocols. The strongest evidence for
potential combinatorial agents is for HDAC inhibitors.
Co-treatment of glioblastoma cells with tranylcypromine
and vorinostat led to a marked (6-fold) increase in
caspase 3 activity [113]. In addition, treatment of primary
AML blasts with the pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat

LSD1 is overexpressed in both solid and nonsolid tumors such as breast, lung, colon, prostate, gastric
cancers and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), playing
significant roles in cell proliferation, cell migration
and metastasis [59, 62, 67, 69, 103-106]. Functional
downregulation of LSD1 expression or pharmacological
inhibition significantly reduces tumor cell proliferation
and metastatic progression in several malignancies in
vitro. Although overexpression of LSD1 (mRNA and/
or protein) is reported across numerous malignancies,
few studies have evaluated whether LSD1 expression
correlates with either cancer progression or overall
survival. For those studies that have investigated the role
of LSD1, limited patient cohort size and lack of clinical
follow-up data has generally impeded the ability of studies
to achieve statistical significance. In neuroblastoma [66],
prostate [68] and ovarian [65] cancer, low LSD1 mRNA
levels were predictive of event free survival. In breast

that pargyline failed to inhibit LSD1 activity toward
demethylation of H3K4 [118, 121].
Recently, our laboratory investigated the therapeutic
potential of a novel reversible and non-competitive
LSD1 inhibitor (HCI-2509, Salarius Pharmaceuticals)
for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma. HCI-2509, an N’(1-phenylethylidene)-benzohydrazide small molecule
(LSD1 IC50 13nM; Figure 1), was originally identified
through structure-based virtual screening [122]. Treatment
of Ewing sarcoma cell lines with HCI-2509 treatment
disrupted the global oncogenic activity of EWS-ETS
fusions and induced apoptosis at physiologically relevant
concentrations near 1µM, as will be discussed in detail
below [22, 71]. In addition, cells expressing EWS-FLI
were approximately 10-fold more sensitive to HCI2509 treatment compared to cells with shRNA-mediated
depletion of EWS-FLI, underscoring the specificity of
LSD1 inhibition for Ewing sarcoma cells. Beyond Ewing
sarcoma, HCI-2509 has also demonstrated single agent
in vitro and in vivo efficacy in models of breast cancer
[1 23], AML [114], poorly differentiated endometrial
carcinoma [124] and castration resistant prostate cancer
[125]. Clinical formulations of HCI-2509 analogues are
currently being assessed and are expected to enter Phase I
clinical testing within the near future.

PRECLINICAL EVALUATION OF LSD1
INHIBITORS IN SARCOMA
Previously prescribed as an anxiolytic and
antidepressant to patients with anxiety or mood disorders
[115], tranylcypromine (TCP) was the first monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitor identified [116]. TCP exerts
its inhibitory activity by covalently binding to FAD,
forming an tetracyclic adduct in the amine oxidase-like
(AOL) domain binding pocket [116, 117]. In addition to
MAOs, TCP is also able to inhibit the demethylase activity
of LSD1 and LSD2, with a Ki of 242μM and 180μM,
respectively [88, 118]. Treatment of neuroblastoma [66]
and breast cancer [59] cell lines in vitro and in vivo with
early derivatives of TCP resulted in significant growth
inhibition. However, these inhibitory effects were only
achieved at supraphysiologic concentrations of TCP,
20-30 fold higher than the enzymatic IC50 for LSD1. In
the context of sarcomas, Bennani-Baiti et al., reported
TCP inhibits the proliferation of Ewing, osteosarcoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma and chrondrosarcoma cell lines,
albeit in millimolar ranges which cannot be reasonably
achieved in clinical settings [69]. Schildhaus, et al. also
demonstrated growth inhibition of synovial sarcoma cell
lines following treatment with TCP and clorgyline [70]. In
consideration of TCP’s adverse toxicity and poor potency/
selectivity (IC50: 20.7µM, 0.2µM and 0.95µM; LSD1,
MAO A and MAO B respectively), several analogues of
tranylcypromine were synthesized with enhanced potency
and target selectivity. This was achieved through the
addition of bulky, branched side chains and the modi­
fication of the phenyl group using crystal structures of
the LSD1 substrate cavity for rational design [119, 120].
Pargyline was initially cited as a suicide inactivator
of monoamine oxidases, blocking the demthylation of
H3K9 by LSD1 during androgen-induced transcription
[50]. However, two subsequent studies demonstrated

of human AML (MLL-translocated). Foundational studies
demonstrate the requirement of LSD1 for clonogenic

cells and LSD1 action at genomic loci bound by MLLAF9 to sustain expression of AML-associated oncogenic
programs which prevent apoptosis and differentiation

ORY-1001 (structure undisclosed), a trans-2phenylcyclopropylamine-based LSD1 inactivator (IC50
< 20nM) from Oryzon Genomics is reported to be 1,000
times more potent than TCP and highly selective over
related enzymes, including LSD2. At sub-nanomolar
concentrations (EC50< 1nM) ORY-1001 was shown to
reduce leukaemic stem cell potential, colony formation
and induce differentiation of AML cell lines [127].
GSK2879552 (GlaxoSmithKline) an N-substituted
tranylcypromine derivative (Figure 1), is the first
irreversible LSD1 inhibitor to be evaluated clinically
in a solid tumor context (Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,
SCLC). The recent screening of 165 cancer cell lines of
varying histology by Mohammad et al., revealed that the
anti-proliferative activity of GSK2879552 was largely
restricted to SCLC and AML cell lines (EC50 2-240nM),
with genomic analyses revealing elevated MYC
expression or amplification was correlated with resistance
to GSK2879552, whereas global DNA hypomethylation
was correlated with sensitivity [64]. In addition, treatment
of AML cell lines promoted the expression of cell
surface markers (CD11b and CD86) associated with a
differentiated immunophenotype, and induced potent
growth inhibition in patient derived bone marrow samples
(EC50 205nM) [128]. The results from these trials are
eagerly awaited and will help further validate whether
targeting the roles of LSD1 in cancer represents a tractable
therapeutic option for patients.

complex genetics of cancer cells. The resulting efforts
have governed the discovery and development of targeted
small molecules and laid the foundation for personalized
medicine. Although molecularly targeted agents aimed
specifically at drivers of pathogenesis have had some
success, one mechanism of patient non-response can be
attributed to pre-existing genetic mutation of the target
gene itself. Fortunately, innate mutation of LSD1 is
seldom observed. A recent search of cBioPortal revealed
that mutation of LSD1 across numerous cancer subtypes
is rare, with the highest mutation rates documented in
urothelial bladder carcinoma (4/130 patients, 3.1%) [129],
and medulloblastoma (1/37 patients, 2.7%) [130]. In
congruence with this observation, mutation of LSD1 was
not detected in either pediatric or adult Ewing sarcoma
patients across five sequencing studies (n = 338 patients)
(Table 2).

is the related fusions sit atop a hierarchy of direct and
indirect events which alter the composition of expressed
genes, through disruption of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes in the cell. The downstream
effects culminate in establishment and maintenance
of an oncogenic phenotype as shown in Figure 2.

Beyond the transcriptional deregulation resulting
from imposition of the NTD in place of the regulatory
N-terminal domain of FLI1, EWS-FLI shows emergent
properties as an aberrant transcription factor at GGAAmicrosatellites throughout the genome [26, 139, 140].
While several ETS-family members can bind GGAA
repetitive elements in vitro, only EWS-FLI is able to
both bind and activate transcription at nearby genes
[139]. Recent deep sequencing studies interrogating the
chromatin state at these GGAA microsatellites describe
EWS-FLI recruitment of CBP/p300 to acetylate H3K27
and promote formation of enhancer elements at these loci
[30, 35]. Several EWS-FLI activated targets indispensable
for transformation, including NKX2.2, CAV1, GSTM4,
and NR0B1 are regulated through EWS-FLI activity
at nearby microsatellites, though none are currently
candidates for therapeutic development [26, 30, 140-142].

EWS-FLI FUNCTIONS AS AN ABERRANT
TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR
Molecular mechanisms animating oncogenesis in
Ewing sarcoma arise from the fusion of the N-terminal
transcriptional modulation domain (NTD) of EWS with
the C-terminal ETS-family DNA binding domain, which
binds DNA elements possessing a core 5’-GGA(A/T)-3’
consensus motif [3]. The transcriptional activation induced
by enforced EWS-FLI expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts is
sufficient for transformation [131]. Indeed, deregulation
of the FLI transcription factor through N-terminal fusion
with other strong activation domains, like VP16, shows
transforming activity, highlighting an important role for
transcriptional activation in Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis
[132]. Unlike full-length EWS, the NTD is shown to
interact with the RNA polymerase II (PolII) complex

Figure 2: EWS-FLI interacts with multiple partners to cause gene specific activation and repression on the road to
oncogenesis. LSD1 inhibition (LSDi) negatively impacts direct transcriptional targets of EWS-FLI, in a manner distinct from HDAC
inhibition (HDACi). Moreover, there is data to suggest additional roles for both LSD1 and HDACs in the downstream effects leading to
oncogenesis, and these remain an area of active study.

THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL HIERARCHY OF
EWS-FLI INCLUDES GENE REPRESSION

DNA and induces enhancer like features to promote gene
activation at critical targets, the data to fully support any
particular mechanistic model remain lacking [30, 35].
This complicates interpretation of the downregulation
of activated targets by LSD1 inhibition considerably.
However, LSD1 plays an important role in enhancer
biology in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and is required
to repress the enhancers of pluripotency regulators during
differentiation [94, 149, 150]. LSD1 is also reported to
localize to enhancers of activated genes in ESCs and
whether LSD1 is important for maintained gene activation
or fine tuning of transcript levels in these contexts remains
unclear [94]. Recent studies in more differentiated cell
systems have shown cell-specific factors can toggle
LSD1 substrate specificity between H3K4 and H3K9
at regulatory regions of target genes to promote either
activating or repressive activity [151, 152]. In our hands,
HCI-2509 showed more pronounced effects on global
H3K9 methylation status in Ewing sarcoma, though the
genomic implications of this result as well as a narrowed
focus on H3K4 at regions of interest remain the work of
continued studies.

Transcriptional profiling of patient-derived Ewing
sarcoma cell lines using RNAi-mediated knockdown
of EWS-FLI revealed a transcriptional signature which
surprisingly showed more genes repressed by the fusion
than activated. Several activated targets of EWS-FLI are,
in fact, transcriptional repressors, including BCL11B,
NKX2.2, NR0B1, and the long noncoding RNA EWSAT1
[27, 143-146]. Globally, the gene targets affected by
these transcriptional repressors comprise only part of the
EWS-FLI downregulated signature. Further investigation
showed that EWS-FLI directly represses a subset of targets
whose downregulation is required for tumorigenesis,
including IGFBP3, TGFBR2, and LOX [71, 147, 148].
Moreover, EWS-FLI directly interacts with CHD4, MTA2,
HDAC2, and HDAC3 in a NuRD-like complex at genes to
enact transcriptional repression [71].

TARGETING MECHANISMS OF GENE
REGULATION

CONCLUSIONS
CHALLENGES

Both indirect repression, for example by NKX2.2,
and direct repression depend upon the activity of
histone deacetylases [71, 145, 146]. Thus, one potential
therapeutic route blocks downstream epigenetic regulators
which execute the repressive transcriptional program of
EWS-FLI. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat
derepresses gene targets of NKX2.2, BCL11B, and EWSFLI and impairs cell viability and transformation in soft
agar assays [71, 145, 146]. We further investigated whether
targeting LSD1 might have similar effects in Ewing
sarcoma models, as it commonly co-localizes with NuRD
in the nucleus. Our initial investigation showed LSD1
inhibition with the small molecule HCI-2509 derepressed
EWS-FLI-repressed targets and decreased cell viability
in a manner comparable to HDAC inhibition [71]. More
thorough transcriptional profiling in A673 and TTC-466
Ewing sarcoma cells intriguingly showed LSD1 inhibition
flips both sides of the transcriptional profile for both EWSFLI and EWS-ERG, respectively, upregulating repressed
targets and vice versa [22] (Figure 2). This contrasts
the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat, which diminished only
EWS-FLI-driven gene repression and hints at roles for
LSD1 in Ewing sarcoma biology beyond its documented
corepressor activity, though the mechanisms of this
activity remain unknown. For both HDAC and LSD1
inhibition, the effects on cell viability and transcription
were mitigated in the context of RNAi-mediated EWS-FLI
depletion, suggesting a disease-specific function for these
enzymes [22, 71,]. Importantly, LSD1 inhibition with
HCI-2509 showed single agent efficacy across multiple
xenograft models for Ewing sarcoma [22].
While several groups have proposed a model for
EWS-FLI activity whereby EWS-FLI binds microsatellite

AND

FUTURE

Exploiting the genetic addictions, vulnerabilities
and esoteric dependencies of cancer cells has fueled a
paradigm shift in conceiving new therapeutic strategies.
Molecularly-targeted treatments informed by patientspecific characteristics are ascendant over non-specific
cytotoxic therapies, where possible. Precision medicine
aims to better address individuals’ diseases while
simultaneously reducing deleterious side effects. The
quiet mutational landscape of Ewing sarcoma, coupled
with documented overexpression of LSD1 and epigenetic
misregulation, highlights the clinical potential of
epigenetic inhibitors for the treatment of this aggressive
malignancy. Indeed, small molecule blockade of DNA
methyltransferase and histone deacetylases has proven
epigenetic inhibitors are useful drug candidates. The low
overall incidence of Ewing sarcoma 2.93 cases/1,000,000
[153], presents several challenges for the translation
of novel agents into the clinic, and underscores the
importance of global multi-center trial efforts to
investigate the therapeutic potential of LSD1 inhibitors.
Although the use of LSD1 inhibitors for Ewing
sarcoma shows promise, there are no reliable molecular
biomarkers to predict either clinical activity or resistance
to LSD1 therapy. Whether resistance will arise due to
genetic mutation of LSD1 itself, activation of adaptive
feedback loops or engagement of compensatory survival
mechanisms outside the biological pathways targeted by
LSD1 inhibitors remains unknown. It is widely accepted
that single agent chemotherapy cannot constitute sole
therapeutic intervention for Ewing sarcoma patients. As
17623

such, future work entails the evaluation of synergetic
combinations which potentiate current Ewing sarcoma
chemotherapeutic cassettes to provide a clear strategy for
further LSD1 inhibitor clinical trials which mitigate drug
resistance and achieve maximal effect. Although the initial
signs are promising, results from ongoing clinical trials are
eagerly anticipated. The rational coupling of mechanistic
insight with translational science will ultimately determine
whether these new epigenetic therapies comprise a
meaningful addition to Ewing sarcoma treatment
protocols.
