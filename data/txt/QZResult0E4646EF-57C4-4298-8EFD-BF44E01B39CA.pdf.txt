BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread use of oxaliplatin-based regimens for colorectal and other gastrointestinal
cancers, there is surprisingly little information regarding their empiric use for the treatment of carcinoma of unknown
primary site (CUP). In the current study, the combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with recurrent
and refractory CUP was examined. METHODS: Patients with CUP who had received at least 1 previous chemotherapy
regimen were treated with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1) and capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 orally twice
daily on Days 1-14). Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days. Patients with objective response or stable disease
after 2 cycles continued treatment for 6 cycles or until disease progression. RESULTS: Nine of 48 patients (19%) had
objective responses to treatment; an additional 22 patients had stable disease at the time of first re-evaluation. After
a median follow-up of 17 months, the median progression-free and overall survivals were 3.7 months and 9.7 months,
respectively. This regimen was reasonably well tolerated by most patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine was found to have activity as a salvage treatment for patients with CUP. This regimen should
be considered in patients with clinical and pathologic features suggesting a primary site in the gastrointestinal tract.
Further development of the regimen as a first-line therapy, or with bevacizumab added, is indicated. Cancer

Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) is a common clinical syndrome, accounting for approximately 2% to
3% of all cancer diagnoses. For most of these patients, a primary tumor site is never identified, and standard management
includes a trial of empiric chemotherapy. Several taxane/platinum regimens have been evaluated as first-line treatments
and have usually produced response rates between 30% and 40%, with median survivals of 8 months to 11 months.1-4
When patients develop disease recurrence or progression after first-line treatment, effective second-line treatment is usually not available. To the best of our knowledge, only a few treatments to date have been evaluated in the second-line setting (eg, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], gemcitabine, gemcitabine/irinotecan), and the activity of these treatments has been
modest at best.5-7
In previous autopsy studies, a substantial percentage of CUP patients were found to have occult primary lesions in
various gastrointestinal tract locations.8 On this basis, early trials of empiric treatment of CUP used regimens developed
for gastrointestinal cancers (eg, 5-FU; 5-, doxorubicin, and mitomycin-C [FAM]; and doxorubicin and mitomycin).5,9-11
However, these regimens had relatively low activity even for gastrointestinal primary cancers. Because substantial recent
improvements have been made in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, particularly colon cancer, it appears likely that

these newer regimens are also more effective as empiric
therapy for CUP. Regimens such as 5-FU, leucovorin,
and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX); 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI); and capecitabine and oxaliplatin
(XELOX) have improved survival in patients with metastatic colon cancer and have also increased the efficacy of
adjuvant therapy for early stage colon cancer.12-15 To our
knowledge to date, there has been limited experience with
any of these regimens in the empiric treatment of patients
with CUP.
In this multicenter phase 2 trial, we evaluated a combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine as empiric second-line therapy for patients with recurrent or refractory
CUP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This multicenter, phase 2 trial was initiated in September
2004. The trial was conducted in the Sarah Cannon
Research Oncology Consortium, a community-based
clinical trials organization (Table 1).
Eligibility
To be eligible for this trial, patients were required to have
histologically or cytologically confirmed CUP. Eligible
tumor histologies included adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and poorly differentiated
neuroendocrine carcinoma. For the purposes of this
study, patients were considered to have CUP if the following diagnostic procedures were unrevealing of a primary
tumor site: complete history, physical examination, chemistry profile, computed tomography scans of the chest and
abdomen, mammography (women), and directed radiologic workup of the symptomatic areas. Panendoscopy
was not required but was performed in patients with
intra-abdominal metastatic sites. Patients were required to
have been treated with 1 previous chemotherapy regimen,
but could not have received previous oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or 5-FU. Patients may also have had treatment with
1 previous immunotherapy or targeted therapy regimen.
Additional eligibility criteria included the following: East-

score of 0, 1, or 2; leukocyte count 3500/lL and platelet
count 100,000/lL; serum bilirubin <1.5 times the
institutional upper limits of normal; serum creatinine
<2.0 mg/dL; ability to swallow oral medications; and age
18 years.
Patient exclusion criteria included the following:
chemotherapy within 3 weeks of study entry, history of
any invasive malignancy within the past 5 years, clinically
significant cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within
6 months, pre-existing peripheral neuropathy > grade 1,
patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
deficiency, and pregnant or lactating women. Patients
with parenchymal brain metastases were eligible only if
they had been previously treated with surgical resection or
radiotherapy and had minimal neurologic symptoms and
no steroid requirement. All patients of child-bearing
potential were required to use adequate contraception
during the entire duration of treatment.
All patients were required to provide written
informed consent before entering this study. The study
was approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of
all participating sites.
Pretreatment Evaluation
Before the initiation of therapy, all patients underwent
complete history, physical examination, complete blood
count, and chemistry profile. Radiologic evaluation
included computed tomography of the head, chest, and
abdomen. Positron emission tomography was recommended but not required. Directed radiologic and endoscopic evaluation of other symptoms was performed as
clinically indicated. Tumor measurements were performed in all patients before beginning therapy.
Routine pathologic evaluation included light microscopic evaluation in all patients. In patients with
poorly differentiated tumors, biopsy specimens allowing
histologic examination (vs cytologic examination only)
were obtained. Additional studies in adenocarcinomas
were performed depending on clinical features; men
with suggestive clinical features had immunostaining for
prostate-specific antigen, whereas women had staining
for hormone receptors and HER–2 expression. Poorly
differentiated carcinomas routinely had additional immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers
(synaptophysin, chromogranin), leukocyte common
antigen, S–100 protein, and HMB-45. Additional pathologic evaluation was individualized on the basis of clinical and pathologic features.

Treatment
All patients received treatment with oxaliplatin at a dose
of 130 mg/m2, given intravenously on Day 1 of each 21–
day cycle. Capecitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 orally
twice daily was administered on Days 1 to 14 of each
cycle. All patients received antiemetic prophylaxis before
oxaliplatin was administered, according to standard
guidelines.
At the beginning of each 21-day cycle, patients were
seen and examined by their physician. In addition, all
patients had complete blood counts and chemistry profile
performed. After 2 cycles (6 weeks) of treatment, patients
were evaluated for response with repeat imaging of all
measured lesions. On the basis of this evaluation, all
patients were assigned a response category. Patients with
objective response or stable disease continued to receive
oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Patients with tumor progression were removed from study.
For patients continuing treatment, re–evaluations
were performed at 6-week intervals. The recommended
duration of treatment was 6 cycles. However, patients
who continued to benefit and were tolerating treatment
well had the option to receive additional treatment cycles
at the discretion of their physician.

Dose Modifications
All patients entering this trial received full doses of both
agents during the first cycle of treatment. There were no
scheduled dose escalations in this study. For subsequent
cycles, dose reductions based on myelosuppression were
based on blood counts measured on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. If the blood counts on Day 1 of a scheduled
treatment cycle were an absolute neutrophil count
<1500/lL or platelet count <75,000/lL, treatment was
delayed by 1 week and the blood counts were remeasured.
If, after a 1-week delay, the blood counts had risen above
the minimum levels listed above, treatment was continued
with 75% doses of both agents. If the blood counts failed
to recover to minimal levels after a delay of 2 weeks, the
patient was removed from the study. All patients who
were hospitalized for treatment of neutropenia and fever
received 75% doses of both drugs during subsequent
cycles. Patients who developed neutropenic fever during
the 14 day course of capecitabine had the drug discontinued for the remainder of that cycle. Leukocyte growth
factors were not routinely used during Cycle 1, but subsequent use was at the discretion of the treating physician,
according to standard guidelines.

2450

The nonhematologic toxicities believed to be most
likely with this treatment were peripheral neuropathy
(oxaliplatin) and hand/foot syndrome (capecitabine).
Patients who developed grade 2 peripheral neuropathy
had the dose of oxaliplatin reduced to 75% for subsequent
cycles. Patients who developed grade 3 or 4 peripheral
neuropathy had oxaliplatin discontinued; these patients
could continue single-agent capecitabine if they were
believed to be benefiting. Patients who developed laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia during oxaliplatin administration
had subsequent infusions increased in duration from 2 to
6 hours, according to standard guidelines. Patients who
developed > grade 1 hand/foot syndrome during or after
capecitabine had any remaining capecitabine doses discontinued for the current cycle, and the subsequent cycle
of therapy was delayed until the hand/foot syndrome had
recovered to  grade 1. Subsequent capecitabine doses
were given at 75%. A maximum of 2 dose reductions was
allowed. If patients developed hand/foot syndrome of >
grade 1 after 2 dose reductions, or required a delay of >2
weeks for symptoms to resolve, capecitabine was discontinued; oxaliplatin could be continued in patients who
were benefiting from treatment.
Patients experiencing other nonhematologic toxicity
> grade 2 had reduction of the offending agent or agents
to 75% during subsequent courses. Patients with irreversible nonhematologic toxicity, or toxicity that required
treatment delay of >2 weeks, were removed from study.
Definition of Response
All patients were re–evaluated for response after completion of 6 weeks of treatment, and response categories were
assigned by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST).16 All patients with major
responses had confirmation of response on repeat scans
performed at 6-week intervals. Patients with stable disease
or minor response at 6 weeks were reevaluated at 6-week
intervals as treatment continued. The final response category assigned to these patients represented the best
response obtained during their treatment course.
Statistical Considerations
This nonrandomized phase 2 study was designed to provide preliminary information regarding the efficacy of the
combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine in the treatment of patients with CUP. Second-line chemotherapy
for CUP patients has been relatively ineffective, producing response rates of 10% and a median overall survival
of 3 to 4.5 months.6,7 Therefore, we considered the

achievement of a response rate >20% or a median survival
of >6 months to be a level of efficacy worthy of additional
development of this combination regimen. The inclusion
of 50 patients in this trial was considered sufficient to allow
the determination of an increase in response rate from
10% to 25% with an a level of .05 and a power of .09.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
date of study entry until the date that tumor progression
or death from any cause was documented. Overall survival
was measured from the date of study entry until the date
of death. Survival curves were constructed by using the
method of Kaplan and Meier.17 Toxicity was evaluated in
all patients who received at least 1 dose of therapy. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between September 2004 and April 2008, 48 patients
were enrolled in this clinical trial (Table 2). The median
age of 59 years is typical for the population of patients
with CUP. The majority of patients (65%) had adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Thirtynine patients (81%) had 2 sites of metastatic cancer; the
most frequent sites of metastasis were the liver (71%),
lung (58%), and lymph nodes (33%). Thirty patients
(63%) had received first-line treatment containing both a
platinum agent and a taxane. Twelve of 48 patients (25%)
had previously had major responses to chemotherapy.
Treatment Received
Forty-four of 48 patients (92%) received at least 2 cycles
(6 weeks) of treatment and were evaluated for response.
Four patients discontinued treatment during the first
6 weeks. Two of these patients had rapid tumor progression, and 2 developed treatment-related toxicity (grade 3
neuropathy in 1 patient and grade 4 diarrhea in 1 patient).
Patients received a median of 12 weeks (4 cycles) of
treatment (range, 3-66 weeks). Fifteen patients completed
6 cycles of treatment with oxaliplatin/capecitabine.
Efficacy
Nine of 48 patients who enrolled in this trial achieved a
partial responses (19%; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 7-31%). Five of the responding patients had not
responded to their first-line chemotherapy. An additional
22 patients (46%) had stable disease as their best response
to treatment. Eight of the 22 patients with stable disease

had continued disease stability for >3 months, and 4 of
these patients had stable disease for >6 months. Of the 31
patients who achieved either an objective response or stable disease with the combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine, 3 had objective responses and 8 had stable
disease to first-line treatment. Twenty-two of these 31
patients had received previous carboplatin or cisplatin.
None of the 8 patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma
had partial responses, and 6 had stable disease. Thirteen
patients (27%) had progressive disease at the time of first
re–evaluation.

Figure 1. Progression-free survival is shown. The median progression-free survival was 3.7 months, with 22% of patients
free of disease progression at 1 year.

After a median follow-up of 17 months, the median
PFS for the entire group was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.69.7 months), with a 1-year PFS rate of 22% (Fig. 1). The
remission duration in the 9 objective responders ranged
from 2 to 48 months (median, 10 months). Twenty-eight
patients (58%) subsequently received further treatment
for CUP.
The overall survival for the entire patient group is
shown in Figure 2. Forty of the 48 patients (83%) had
died at the time of last follow–up. The median survival
was 9.7 months (95% CI, 5.6-13.5 months); the 1-year
and 2-year survival rates were 40% and 12%, respectively.
Toxicity
Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related toxicities are listed in
Table 3. Severe myelosuppression was uncommon; only 1
patient developed febrile neutropenia, and there were no
complications related to severe thrombocytopenia. Nausea and vomiting were common with this regimen, with
resulting dehydration in 9 patients. Grade 3 peripheral
neuropathy occurred in 2 patients. One of these patients
discontinued treatment, whereas 1 patient continued
treatment with capecitabine. In addition, 8 patients developed grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. Other nonhematologic toxicities were uncommon.
Overall, 13 hospitalizations were required for the
management of treatment-related toxicity. Six patients
discontinued this treatment regimen due to toxicity.

of the taxanes and gemcitabine into first-line regimens has
resulted in a modest improvement in efficacy, second-line
therapy is largely undefined. In recent years, single-agent
gemcitabine and the combination of gemcitabine and irinotecan have been studied in this setting. Both treatments
had objective response rates of <10%, with median survivals of 3 months and 4.5 months, respectively.6,7 The
combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib has also been
studied in the second-line setting.18 Although the major
response rate with this combination was also low (10%),
this regimen appeared to have better activity in producing
a median PFS of 4 months and a median overall survival

of 7.4 months. However, there is no question that more
active treatments are needed.
Oxaliplatin-based regimens have become a cornerstone
in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma12-15 and
have demonstrated activity in adenocarcinomas arising in
other gastrointestinal sites.19,20 Despite the widespread
use of oxaliplatin-based regimens, there is a surprising
lack of information regarding their empiric use for the
treatment of CUP. In this study, the combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine demonstrated significant activity
and produced a 19% response rate in this group of
patients with refractory disease. In addition, the median
PFS and overall survivals (3.7 months and 9.7 months,
respectively) were higher than reported with other second-line regimens. These survival results are similar to
those reported with current first-line regimens, and support further evaluation of the combination of oxaliplatin
and capecitabine. As in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, the addition of bevacizumab may further
improve its efficacy.
Because oxaliplatin and capecitabine have known
activity against a variety of gastrointestinal cancers, we
examined our patient population for clinical syndromes
strongly suggesting occult gastrointestinal primary sites.
Eleven patients with non-neuroendocrine carcinoma had
metastases limited to intra-abdominal sites, and 7 had
liver metastases only. Five of 11 patients (45%) with only
intra-abdominal metastases achieved partial responses to
the combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine (3 of 7
patients with liver-only metastases). There were no
patients with a single liver mass or a large predominant
liver metastasis suggestive of a hepatobiliary primary site.
In the future, the concept of using a single empiric
regimen to treat patients with CUP is likely to change. Already, a colon cancer profile has been defined, which
includes patients with adenocarcinoma involving intraabdominal sites (primarily the liver and peritoneum) with
typical immunohistochemical features (CK20 positive/
CK7 negative; CDX2 positive).21 Preliminary data indicate that patients with CUP who fit this profile respond
well to empiric therapy with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab
(ie, standard treatment for advanced colorectal cancer). In
addition to this type of clinical profiling, recent experience suggests that molecular profiling assays may be able
to predict the tissue of origin in a sizeable percentage of
CUP patients.22,23 Studies currently are underway to evaluate the efficacy of treatment based on diagnoses provided
by molecular profiling assays. Therefore, it may soon be
possible to accurately separate patients with a likely pri-

mary site in the gastrointestinal tract, in whom the use of
an oxaliplatin-based regimen would maximize the chance
for effective treatment.
In summary, the combination of oxaliplatin and
capecitabine has activity as a salvage regimen in patients
with CUP. This regimen should be further evaluated as
first-line treatment, and with the addition of bevacizumab. The use of an oxaliplatin-based regimen should currently be considered in CUP patients who have clinical
and/or pathologic features suggestive of a gastrointestinal
primary site.
