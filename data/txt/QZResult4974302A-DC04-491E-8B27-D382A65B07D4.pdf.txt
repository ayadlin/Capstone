Abstract
Short-chain fatty acids, generated in colon by bacterial
fermentation of dietary fiber, protect against colorectal cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease. Among these bacterial
metabolites, butyrate is biologically most relevant. GPR109A
is a G-protein–coupled receptor for nicotinate but recognizes butyrate with low affinity. Millimolar concentrations
of butyrate are needed to activate the receptor. Although
concentrations of butyrate in colonic lumen are sufficient to
activate the receptor maximally, there have been no reports
on the expression/function of GPR109A in this tissue. Here we
show that GPR109A is expressed in the lumen-facing apical
membrane of colonic and intestinal epithelial cells and that
the receptor recognizes butyrate as a ligand. The expression of
GPR109A is silenced in colon cancer in humans, in a mouse
model of intestinal/colon cancer, and in colon cancer cell
lines. The tumor-associated silencing of GPR109A involves
DNA methylation directly or indirectly. Reexpression of
GPR109A in colon cancer cells induces apoptosis, but only in
the presence of its ligands butyrate and nicotinate. Butyrate is
an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, but apoptosis induced
by activation of GPR109A with its ligands in colon cancer
cells does not involve inhibition of histone deacetylation. The
primary changes in this apoptotic process include downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1 and up-regulation
of death receptor pathway. In addition, GPR109A/butyrate
suppresses nuclear factor-KB activation in normal and cancer
colon cell lines as well as in normal mouse colon. These
studies show that GPR109A mediates the tumor-suppressive
effects of the bacterial fermentation product butyrate in
colon. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):2826–32]

Introduction
The mammalian colon is the home for billions of bacteria, and
these bacteria markedly influence the biology of the host, including
energy balance, gene expression, immune function, and disease
processes (1–3). Dietary fiber is fermented by bacteria in the
colonic lumen to generate short-chain fatty acids, which are
responsible for the beneficial effects of gut bacteria on intestinal/

colonic health (4, 5). The presence of short-chain fatty acids in the
colonic lumen is linked to decreased incidence of colorectal cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease (6–9), but little is known on the
molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of colonic
health by these bacterial products. One of these short-chain fatty
acids is butyrate, which functions as a tumor suppressor by
inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC; refs. 10, 11). Recently, we
and others have identified a Na+-coupled transporter for shortchain fatty acids (12, 13). This transporter, known as SLC5A8,
recognizes short-chain fatty acids and other monocarboxylates as
substrates (12–17). SLC5A8 was originally identified as a tumor
suppressor in colon (18) and its expression is silenced in colon
cancer (18–20). The discovery that SLC5A8 is an active transporter
for butyrate explains, at least partly, its tumor-suppressive function
in colon (21–23). SLC5A8-mediated entry of butyrate from lumen
into colonic epithelial cells leads to HDAC inhibition and tumor
suppression. The expression of SLC5A8 in the lumen-facing apical
membrane of colonocytes supports this mode of action (17, 19, 24).
Studies on the tumor-suppressive function of butyrate have
focused thus far mostly on its intracellular action as an HDAC
inhibitor. Here we show that butyrate also elicits effects in colon
cells extracellularly by serving as a ligand for GPR109A. GPR109A is
a receptor for nicotinate (niacin) and mediates the lipid-lowering
actions of the vitamin (25–27). Recently, Taggart and colleagues
(28) showed that the ketone body h-D-hydroxybutyrate is a ligand
for the receptor at physiologic concentrations. Butyrate was
also able to activate the receptor with an EC50 (i.e., concentration necessary for half-maximal activation of the receptor) of
f1.6 mmol/L. Although the levels of butyrate in circulation are too
low (f5 Amol/L) to activate the receptor, butyrate is present at
high levels (f20 mmol/L) in colonic lumen (29). If GPR109A is
expressed in the lumen-facing apical membrane of colonocytes, it
might suggest that the ability of butyrate to prevent cancer and
inflammation in the colon may also be mediated extracellularly via
the receptor without entering into cells. This rationale formed the
basis of the current investigation.

Materials and Methods
Immunohistochemistry. Polyclonal antibodies against GPR109A and
GPR109B were generated in rabbits. The antigenic peptides used were
RKKTLGEPDNNRSTSVC and CHQEPASLEKQLG, respectively. There is only
a single gene coding for nicotinate receptor (GPR109A) in mouse (30);
therefore, mouse intestinal and colonic tissues were examined only for
GPR109A. Human colonic biopsies were obtained during colonoscopy after
obtaining patients’ informed consent and approval from the institutional
review board. Because there are two genes in humans coding for GPR109

GPR109A Functions as a Tumor Suppressor in Colon
(GPR109A and GPR109B; ref. 30), human tissues were examined for both
isoforms.
Nicotinate binding. Membranes prepared from CCD841 cells (a human
colonic cell line) were used for [3H]nicotinate binding assays with a rapid
filtration method (31). The interaction of butyrate with the receptor was
evaluated by its ability to compete with nicotinate for binding.
Functional analysis of GPR109A. Activation of GPR109A with its
ligands was examined using the activity of G-protein–coupled inwardly
rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as the readout. HEK 293 cells were
transfected with a human GPR109A expression vector and used for experiments 48 h later. Activation of GIRK channels by adenosine receptor

A1R was used as a positive control. A cytosolic GFP expression vector
(Invitrogen) was cotransfected with A1R or GPR109A expression vectors to
identify transfected cells. When indicated, cells were pretreated overnight
with pertussis toxin (100 ng/mL). GIRK channel activity was monitored as
described previously (32).
Tissue collection. Paired normal colon and colon tumor specimens were
collected from 18 adult patients with colorectal cancer, with patients’
informed consent and approval from the institutional review board (33).
Wild-type and ApcMin/+ mice were euthanized by CO2, and tissues from the
intestinal tract were collected for RNA preparation.
Reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR primers for specific genes were
designed based on the nucleotide sequences available in GenBank. Reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was repeated twice with each RNA sample.
Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was used as the internal
standard. The intensities of the bands corresponding to specific gene
transcripts were quantified by densitometry scanning and normalized to
the intensities of corresponding HPRT bands.
Ectopic expression of human GPR109A. Cells (CCD841, a human
normal colon cell line, and KM12L4, a human colon cancer cell line) were
transfected with pcDNA or human GPR109A cDNA. pEGFP-N1 was used for
cotransfection to determine transfection efficiency. After 24 h, cells were
treated with or without butyrate (1 mmol/L) or nicotinate (1 mmol/L) for
24 h. Preparation of RNA and protein lysates was done as described
previously (20). For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, cells
were fixed in 50% ethanol; treated with 0.1% sodium citrate, 1 mg/mL
RNase, and 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide; and subjected to FACS.
Western blot analysis. Fifty micrograms of protein were fractionated
by SDS-PAGE, and the fractionated proteins were transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schull). Membranes were blocked
with bovine serum albumin and then exposed to respective primary
antibodies at 4jC overnight, followed by treatment with appropriate
secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized by ECL SuperSignal Western
System (GE Healthcare).
HDAC activity. A commercially available kit (BioVision) was used to
determine HDAC activity in a cell-free system (34). The acetylation status of
histone H3, histone H4, histone H4-Lys12, and histone H4-Lys16 was assessed
by Western blot with specific antibodies as described previously (34). For
normalization, the protein levels of histone H3 and histone H4 were
determined with specific antibodies. The antibodies were obtained from
the following sources: histone H3, acetylated histone H3, histone H4, and
acetylated H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); acetylated H4-Lys12 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.); and acetylated H4-Lys16 (Abcam, Inc.).
Nuclear factor-KB-luciferase reporter assay. Cells were transfected
with a nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)-luciferase reporter construct alone or
with GPR109A cDNA. Twenty-four hours later, cells were pretreated with
GPR109A ligands for 4 h and then treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
100 ng/mL) and GPR109A ligands for an additional 4 h. Cells were then
lysed, and the lysates used for luciferase activity. NF-nB-luciferase reporter
assay was also done with colon tissues obtained from transgenic mice
carrying the NF-nB-luciferase transgene under the control of h-actin
promoter. Mice were euthanized by CO2, and colons were removed and
everted. Tissue slices (f10 mg wet weight) were used for incubation with
LPS with or without pretreatment with GPR109A ligands. Tissues were then
homogenized, and the lysates used for measurement of luciferase activity.

Expression of GPR109 in mouse and human colons. We first
investigated the expression of GPR109A in mouse intestinal tract
and human colon. GPR109A mRNA was detected all through the
intestinal tract in mouse (Fig. 1A). The expression was lowest
in the proximal parts of the intestinal tract and highest in the
distal parts. Human colon expressed both isoforms, GPR109A and
GPR109B. Two human normal colon cell lines, NCM460 and
CCD841, also expressed GPR109A and GPR109B (Fig. 1B). Expression of GPR109A, analyzed by immunohistochemistry, was evident

in small intestine (jejunum and ileum) as well as in large intestine
in mouse (Fig. 1C). The expression was restricted to the lumenfacing apical membrane of intestinal/colonic epithelial cells.
The immunopositive signals were not detected when antigenneutralized primary antibody was used. Human colonic biopsies
were examined for expression of GPR109A and GPR109B using
respective antibodies (Fig. 1D). Human colon expressed both
isoforms of GPR109. The expression of GPR109A as well as of
GPR109B in human colon was restricted to the apical membrane.
Butyrate as a ligand for GPR109A. CCD841 cells were used to
study nicotinate binding and interaction of butyrate with GPR109A.
Specific binding of nicotinate was detected with membranes
prepared from these cells; the binding was inhibited by butyrate
(10 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1A). The binding of nicotinate
was of high affinity (K d, 245 F 32 nmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
The function of butyrate as a GPR109A agonist was investigated
using a heterologous expression system in which the coupling of
pertussis toxin–sensitive Gi proteins to the receptor was monitored
with the activity of inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels
as the readout. GIRK channels open in response to activation of
pertussis toxin–sensitive G proteins (e.g., Gi and Go; ref. 35). We
used as a positive control the ability of ectopically expressed
adenosine receptor A1R to activate GIRK channels in the presence
of adenosine. Expression of GPR109A in HEK293 cells allowed
activation of GIRK channels in the presence of nicotinate and
butyrate (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). In cells transfected with
vector alone, nicotinate did not activate the channel. The
involvement of GPR109A in the process was further confirmed by
the effective blockade of nicotinate-induced activation of the
channel by pertussis toxin. These results show that butyrate
functions as an agonist for GPR109A.
Relevance of GPR109A to colon cancer. To determine the
relevance of GPR109A to the tumor-suppressive effects of butyrate
in colon, we first examined the expression of GPR109A in normal
colon and in colon cancer in humans. The receptor expression was
decreased in a majority of primary colon cancer samples compared

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

with corresponding normal colon samples (the decrease in mRNA
levels was evident in 15 of 18 paired samples; Fig. 2A). A pairwise
comparison (cancer versus normal) with all 18 paired samples
showed that the decrease in expression in cancer tissues was 83 F
5% (P < 0.001). The levels of GPR109B mRNA were also reduced in
colon cancer, but the decrease was much smaller (34 F 8%; P <
0.05). We also examined the expression of GPR109A in a mouse
model of intestinal/colon cancer (ApcMin/+ mouse; Fig. 2B). The
expression of the receptor mRNA was evident in colon, small
intestine, and intestinal mucosal scrapings from wild-type mouse.
The expression levels markedly decreased in tumor-bearing regions
of colon and intestine from ApcMin/+ mouse. Even in regions where
there was no evidence of tumor, the expression was reduced
significantly in ApcMin/+ mouse compared with wild-type mouse.
We then monitored the expression levels of GPR109A and GPR109B
in normal and cancer colon cell lines of human origin (Fig. 2C). The
normal cell lines CCD841 and NCM460 expressed the receptor, but
the expression was markedly reduced in cancer cell lines (SW480,
SW620, KM12C, KM12L4, HT29, HCT116, Colo201, Colo205, and
LS174T). The expression of GPR109B was not significantly different
in cancer cell lines compared with normal cell lines.
Role of DNA methylation in the cancer-associated silencing
of GPR109A in colon. To determine whether the decrease in the
expression of GPR109A in colon cancer is due to DNA methylation,
we treated normal and cancer colon cell lines with the DNA
methylation inhibitor 5¶-azacytidine and examined the expression
of GPR109A. The treatment had no effect on GPR109A mRNA levels
in normal cell lines. In contrast, the expression of the gene was
induced in cancer cell lines in response to treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A), indicating that DNA methylation is involved in the
silencing of the gene in cancer cells. To determine which DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) is responsible for this process, we first
evaluated the expression levels of different isoforms of DNMTs in
normal and cancer cell lines and also in normal colon and in colon
cancer (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). We found the expression
levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3b to be increased significantly in

colon cancer cell lines and in primary colon cancer. DNMT1 mRNA
levels increased 7.5 F 0.6-fold (P < 0.001) in primary colon
cancer compared with normal colon. The corresponding value
for DNMT3b was 2.5 F 0.3 (P < 0.01). There was no change in the
levels of DNMT3a mRNA in primary colon cancer versus normal
colon (P > 0.05). These data indicated that DNMT1, DNMT3b, or
both might be involved in the silencing of GPR109A in colon
cancer. We then examined the expression of GPR109A in HCT116
cells (a human colon cancer cell line positive for the expression of
all three isoforms of DNMT) and in isogenic HCT116 cell lines with
targeted deletion of DNMT1 (DNMT1 / ), DNMT3b (DNMT3b / ),
or both (DKO). We found very little expression of GPR109A in
control HCT116 cells, but the expression was markedly induced in
DNMT1 / cells and DKO cells but not in DNMT3b / cells. This
was evident at the levels of mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B).
This suggests that DNMT1 is most likely responsible for the

silencing of GPR109A in cancer. In contrast to GPR109A, the levels
of GPR109B mRNA remained the same in these cell lines, indicating
that the expression of GPR109B is not regulated by DNMTs.
To further confirm the involvement of DNMT1 in the cancerassociated silencing of GPR109A, we used procainamide, a specific
inhibitor of DNMT1 (36). Treatment of colon cancer cell lines with
this compound induced the expression of the receptor (Fig. 3C),
supporting the conclusion that DNMT1 mediates the silencing of
GPR109A in cancer cell lines.
Role of GPR109A in the tumor-suppressive effects of
butyrate. To determine whether the butyrate receptor GPR109A
has any role in the tumor-suppressive actions of butyrate, we
selected CCD841 cells and KM12L4 cells as representatives of a
normal colon cell line and a colon cancer cell line, respectively.
CCD841 cells constitutively express the receptor. Exposure of these
cells to GPR109A ligands butyrate or nicotinate did not have any
effect on these cells (Fig. 4A). This was true even when the receptor
was overexpressed by transfection with an expression vector.
KM12L4 cells, being a cancer cell line, do not express the receptor.
Accordingly, exposure of these cells to the receptor ligands butyrate
or nicotinate did not have any effect (Fig. 4B). However, when
the receptor was expressed ectopically, exposure of the cells to
butyrate or nicotinate induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). The GPR109A/
nicotinate–induced apoptosis in KM12L4 cells was associated with
activation of caspases (Fig. 4C). In addition, the expression of
various antiapoptotic genes (Bcl-2, Bcl-W, Bcl-xL, and Bfl-1) was
decreased and that of various proapoptotic genes (FAS-L, FAS-R,
FADD, and TNF-R1) was increased in association with GPR109A/
nicotinate–induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, the expression of cyclin D1 was decreased and the expression
of PTEN, PPARc , and Foxo3A was increased with GPR109A/
nicotinate. Another interesting finding was the subunit switching
for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in association with GPR109A/
nicotinate–induced apoptosis. The expression of p55a was
increased whereas the expression of p85a was decreased. Butyrate
can diffuse into mammalian cells to some extent whereas
nicotinate cannot. Therefore, to eliminate any potential confusion
in the interpretation of the data, we used nicotinate rather than
butyrate as the receptor ligand in these experiments.
Noninvolvement of HDAC inhibition in cancer cell apoptosis
induced by GPR109A activation. Butyrate is an inhibitor of
HDAC. We have previously shown that butyrate induces apoptosis
in colon cancer cell lines if SLC5A8, a butyrate transporter, is
expressed in these cells and that the process is associated with
inhibition of HDACs (20). In the present study, we showed that
butyrate induces apoptosis in cancer cells by activation of
GPR109A on the cell surface. To determine whether the apoptosis
induced in colon cancer cells by GPR109A activation involved
HDAC inhibition, we measured HDAC activity in CCD841 and
KM12L4 cells under various experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). HDAC activity was significantly lower in
CCD841 cells than in KM12L4 cells, showing that cancer cells
have higher HDAC activity. The levels of HDAC activity did not
change in CCD841 cells irrespective of whether or not GPR109A
was expressed ectopically in these cells or whether or not these
cells were exposed to nicotinate (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
The same was true in KM12L4 cells. Importantly, there was no
change in HDAC activity in these cells even after transfection
with a GPR109A expression vector followed by treatment with
nicotinate (Supplementary Fig. S4 B). However, apoptosis was
induced in these cells under these conditions. These HDAC

activity data were confirmed by monitoring the acetylation status
of histone H3, histone H4, histone H4-Lys12, and histone
H4-Lys16 (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Blockade of NF-KB by GPR109A ligands in colon. Normal
colonic epithelium expresses the toll-like receptor TLR4, which
functions as a receptor for bacterial LPS (37). Intriguingly, there is
no undue inflammation of the colonic epithelium under normal
conditions in the presence of bacteria in the colon. LPS is known
to activate NF-nB signaling through TLR4. Because NF-nB is proinflammatory and protumorigenic, we investigated the relevance of
GPR109A and butyrate to LPS-induced NF-nB activation in colon
cells. The normal colon cell line CCD841 constitutively expressed
GPR109A and TLR4 (data not shown). When transfected with a
NF-nB-luciferase reporter, the expression of luciferase in these cells
was induced by LPS treatment, but pretreatment with butyrate
completely abolished this induction (Fig. 5A). This effect was
reproduced with nicotinate and acifran, two other agonists of
GPR109A. The colon cancer cell line KM12L4 expressed TLR4 but
not GPR109A (data not shown). LPS induced luciferase expression
in these cells after transfection with the reporter, but GPR109A
ligands had no effect on this induction (Fig. 5B). This was expected
because of the absence of GPR109A. However, with ectopic
expression of GPR109A, the induction of luciferase by LPS in this
cell line was significantly blocked by GPR109A ligands (P < 0.001).
These results were corroborated by studies with HCT116 cells,
which did not express GPR109A, and DNMT1 / isogenic HCT116
cells, which expressed the receptor (Fig. 5C). To determine whether
these findings are reproducible in normal colon, we used colon
tissues from a transgenic mouse that carries the NF-nB-luciferase
reporter gene under the control of h-actin promoter. Because
normal colon constitutively expresses GPR109A, we directly tested
the effects of GPR109A ligands on LPS-induced activation of NF-nB
reporter in these tissues. Butyrate and other GPR109A ligands were
able to block LPS-induced activation of NF-nB in normal colon
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, activation of GPR109A in
normal colon blocked not only LPS-induced activation of NF-nB
but also the basal activity of NF-nB.

Discussion
Gut bacteria play a critical role in the prevention of colon cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease, but the molecular mechanisms

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

involved in the process are not well understood. The short-chain
fatty acids generated by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and
unabsorbed carbohydrates are believed to be responsible for these
effects. Epidemiologic studies indicate that increased intake of
fiber in the diet is linked to decreased risks of colon cancer and
inflammatory bowel disease (8). Among the short-chain fatty acids
produced by the bacteria in colon, butyrate is unique in that it is
an inhibitor of HDACs (10, 11). Butyrate induces differentiation in
normal intestinal and colonic epithelial cells but causes apoptosis
in colon cancer cells (4–7). The ability of butyrate to inhibit HDACs
inside the cells provides a molecular mechanism for these effects.
This intracellular action of butyrate requires a mechanism for the
entry of butyrate into cells. SLC5A8 was recently identified as a
Na+-coupled high-affinity transporter for butyrate; the ability of the
transporter to mediate the concentrative entry of butyrate into
colon cells offers a mechanism for the tumor-suppressive effect of
this bacterial metabolite (21–23).
The present studies unravel a novel mode of action of butyrate
in colon, involving the cell surface G-protein–coupled receptor
GPR109A. This receptor is expressed in normal colon on the
lumen-facing apical membrane of colonic epithelial cells where it
has access to luminal contents. Butyrate serves as a ligand for the
receptor. Our studies show that this receptor functions as a tumor
suppressor in colon. GPR109A is expressed in normal colon but is
silenced in colon cancer. This phenomenon is also seen in colon
cell lines; normal cell lines express the receptor whereas cancer cell
lines do not. Activation of the receptor in normal colon cells does
not induce cell death. However, when the receptor is expressed
ectopically in colon cancer cells, activation of the receptor with
butyrate or other ligands leads to apoptosis. The cancer-associated
silencing of GPR109A occurs via DNA methylation. DNMT1 is
responsible for this process. It is not known at present whether
GPR109A is the direct target for DNMT1 or whether the silencing of
GPR109A occurs indirectly through some other intermediary gene
products. The cell death in colon cancer cells induced by GPR109A
activation does not involve inhibition of HDACs. Thus, the bacterial
fermentation product butyrate causes cell death in colon cancer
cells by two independent but complementary mechanisms: one
through SLC5A8-mediated entry of butyrate into cells with
subsequent inhibition of HDACs, and the second through GPR109A
independent of HDACs. The signaling pathways responsible for
GPR109A/butyrate–induced cell death in cancer cells remain to be

GPR109A Functions as a Tumor Suppressor in Colon

identified. Inhibitors of DNA methylation are currently being
evaluated for their utility in cancer chemotherapy (38); unfortunately, clinical trials have shown encouraging results against
leukemia but not against solid tumors such as colon cancer. Because
our studies show that inhibition of DNA methylation in colon
cancer cells induces GPR109A expression and that activation of
the receptor causes tumor cell–specific apoptosis, the efficacy of
DNA methylation inhibitors in the treatment of colon cancer might
be enhanced by cotreatment with GPR109A ligands such as
nicotinate.
The present studies show that GPR109A functions not only as a
tumor suppressor but also as a blocker of LPS-induced NF-nB
activation. The NF-nB signaling pathway plays a critical role in
colonic inflammation as well as in inflammation-induced cancer
(39). Our present findings suggest that butyrate mediates the pro-

tective effects of gut bacteria against inflammatory bowel disease by
serving as a ligand for GPR109A. This is supported by a recent study,
which showed a significant decrease in the number of butyrateproducing bacteria in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis
compared with normal controls (40). Chronic inflammation of the
colon as seen in ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for colon cancer;
therefore, GPR109A ligands may have potential as therapeutic agents
in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.
The expression of GPR109B is altered only slightly in colon
cancer. Although GPR109B has high homology to GPR109A in
primary structure, the two isoforms have marked differences in
ligand specificity. GPR109B exhibits drastically reduced affinity
than GPR109A for nicotinate and butyrate (28). This suggests that,
unlike GPR109A, GPR109B does not function as a butyrate receptor
in colon. Because GPR109B is not likely to mediate the biological

activation by GPR109A in the normal colon
cell line CCD841 and in the colon cancer
cell lines KM12L4 and HCT116. A,
CCD841 cells were first transfected with
a NF-nB-luciferase reporter construct.
Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated
with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without
pretreatment with butyrate (But ; 1 mmol/L),
nicotinate (Nic ; 1 mmol/L), or acifran
(Aci ; 0.25 mmol/L) for 4 h. The ligands
were present for an additional 4 h during
treatment with LPS. LPS-induced
activation of NF-nB was monitored by
measuring the activity of luciferase as a
reporter. UT, no treatment with GPR109A
ligands. B, KM12L4 cells were transfected
with a NF-nB-luciferase reporter together
with either vector or GPR109A cDNA.
Twenty-four hours later, cells were
treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 4 h
with or without pretreatment with butyrate
(mmol/L), nicotinate (1 mmol/L), and
acifran (0.25 mmol/L) for 4 h. In addition
to the pretreatment, the ligands were
present also during LPS treatment.
LPS-induced activation of NF-nB was
monitored by measuring the activity of
luciferase as a reporter. C, HCT116 cells
(DNMT+/+ and DNMT1 / ) were
transfected with a NF-nB-luciferase
reporter construct. Twenty-four hours
later, cells were treated with LPS
(100 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without
pretreatment with butyrate (1 mmol/L),
nicotinate (1 mmol/L), or acifran (0.25
mmol/L) for 4 h. The ligands were present
also during LPS treatment. LPS-induced
activation of NF-nB was monitored by
measuring the activity of luciferase.

effects of butyrate, this isoform is not targeted for silencing in
colon cancer. Interestingly, medium-chain fatty acids such as
heptanoate and octanoate activate GPR109B; however, these fatty
acids are not generated at significant concentrations in colonic
lumen by bacterial fermentation. Because GPR109B is expressed
almost at normal levels in colon cancer, it might be useful to
evaluate in future studies the potential of this receptor as a drug
target for treatment of colon cancer.
