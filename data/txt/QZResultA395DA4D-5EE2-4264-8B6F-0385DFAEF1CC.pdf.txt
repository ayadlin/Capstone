BACKGROUND. Increasing evidence suggests a relation between patient expectancies and chemotherapy-induced nausea. However, this research has often failed
to adequately control for other possible contributing factors. In the current study,
the contribution of patient expectancies to the occurrence and severity of postchemotherapy nausea was examined using more stringent statistical techniques
(namely hierarchical regression) than other similar studies that have relied on
bivariate correlations, chi-square tests, and stepwise regression, and further

nausea and patients that are highly expectant of experiencing nausea appear to
be at particular risk. Interventions that target these patients should reduce the

lthough methods for the prevention and control of emesis have
improved greatly, nausea continues to be a significant burden
to patients undergoing chemotherapy. The vast majority of cancer
patients still report experiencing nausea at some point during their
chemotherapy treatment1 and it is particularly troublesome for
patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapies such as cisplatin and doxorubicin.2,3 Nausea is often rated as 1 of the most severe
and debilitating side effects of the treatment4–6 and can negatively
affect patients’ nutritional habits, ability to work, and motivation to
follow recommended treatment regimens.6,7 It is also inherently
unpleasant and contributes significantly to poorer quality of life
(QoL).7–11

Expectancy, QoL, and Nausea/Colagiuri et al.

Given the continued high prevalence of chemotherapy-related nausea and its detrimental impact on
QoL, determining what causes this nausea and how
it might be reduced remains an important goal for
clinicians and researchers alike. Patient expectancies
represent 1 possible causal mechanism that is open
to manipulation. Indeed, a growing body of evidence
has demonstrated a link between patient expectancies for nausea and their actual experience of both
anticipatory12,13 and postchemotherapy nausea.1,14–18
In 1 study, patients who believed that they were
‘‘very likely’’ to experience severe nausea from their
chemotherapy treatment were 5 times more likely to
subsequently experience severe nausea than those who
believed that they were ‘‘very unlikely’’ to do so.18
This type of evidence for expectancy-induced
nausea appears to fit in well with current research
on the placebo effect, in which expectancy is believed
to play a key role.19–22 Typically, this research shows
that positive expectancies can lead to beneficial health
outcomes (eg, pain relief).23,24 However, there is also
evidence to suggest that negative expectancies can
lead to adverse outcomes, often labeled the nocebo
effect.25,26 One study found that when patients participating in a clinical trial of sulfinpyrazone or aspirin
for unstable angina were warned about gastrointestinal discomfort, they were much more likely to report
subsequent gastrointestinal discomfort during treatment and had a 6-fold drop-out rate compared with
patients who were not warned about this possibility.27
However, 1 limitation to previous research on
expectancies and chemotherapy-related nausea is
that it has often failed to adequately control for other
possible contributing factors, with the majority of
these studies relying on bivariate correlations,18 chisquare tests,17 and/or stepwise regression.15,16,18
Although this undoubtedly stems from the inherent
impossibility of randomly assigning patients to different levels of expectancy, it nonetheless limits the
certainty with which we can attribute a causal role to
expectancy. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there
is a linear relation between patient expectancies and
nausea or whether there is a certain level of expectancy required to produce an effect. If the relation is
nonlinear, it could be the case that those with particularly high levels of expectancy experience more
nausea than those with lower levels of expectancy.
Conversely, perhaps having very low expectancies for
nausea has a protective effect and results in less nausea in these patients compared with those who have
higher levels of expectancy.
The current study aimed to overcome these limitations to determine, with more confidence, whether
expectancy contributes to postchemotherapy nausea.

655

To do this, we adopted more conservative statistical
techniques, namely, hierarchical regression, to evaluate the independent contribution of expectancy to
postchemotherapy nausea over and above other
potential contributing factors such as age, sex, susceptibility to motion sickness, and baseline QoL.
Although 2 previous studies1,14 investigating the relation between expectancy and postchemotherapy
nausea have employed hierarchical regression, both
involved only a small number of patients relative to
the number of variables included in their models. We
also categorized patients into groups according to
their level of expectancy to investigate whether a
particular level of expectancy either heightened or
protected against the occurrence of nausea in
patients undergoing chemotherapy. In addition, we
conducted analyses examining the relation between
pretreatment QoL and nausea expectancies as well
as between postchemotherapy nausea and posttreatment QoL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The patients were participants in a multicenter trial
comparing antiemetic regimens for the treatment of
delayed nausea. They were enrolled from 18 private
practice oncology groups in the U.S. between June
12, 2001, and June 11, 2004. Eligible patients
were aged  18 years with any cancer diagnosis and
were about to receive their first chemotherapy treatment containing doxorubicin and antiemetic prophylaxis with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron,
granisetron, or dolasetron plus dexamethasone or the
equivalent dose of intravenous methylprednisolone
on the day of treatment. Patients were randomized
to receive 1 of 3 regimens for the control of delayed
nausea on Days 2 and 3 after chemotherapy: Arm 1,
which was comprised of prochlorperazine administered at a dose of 10 mg orally every 8 hours; Arm 2,
which was comprised of any first-generation 5-HT3
receptor antagonist using standard dosage; or Arm 3,
which was comprised of prochlorperazine administered at a dose of 10 mg orally as needed. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant. Only minimal differences were observed among
study arms (see Hickok et al2 for additional details).
In the following report, the study arm was statistically controlled for as appropriate.
Measures
At the time of enrolment, patients completed a pretreatment assessment comprising an on-study interview, a QoL questionnaire, and an expectancy

questionnaire. The on-study interview contained
questions regarding demographics, previous treatment, and susceptibility to motion sickness. QoL was
assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy Scale-General (FACT-G; version 4). It is a
widely used and well-validated measure for assessing
QoL in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy
treatment.28 The expectancy questionnaire has been
previously used by our group29 and contained questions assessing patient expectancies for post-treatment nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hair loss. Four of
these questions assessed expectancies for nausea.
One required the patients to rate the likelihood that
they would experience nausea after their chemotherapy treatment on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (‘‘I
am certain I will not have this’’) to 5 (‘‘I am certain I
will have this’’). A second question required the
patients to rate the expected severity of their postchemotherapy nausea as ‘‘very mild or none at all,’’
‘‘mild,’’ ‘‘moderate,’’ ‘‘severe,’’ ‘‘very severe,’’ or ‘‘intolerable.’’ A third question asked the patients to rate
their perceived susceptibility to nausea compared
with their friends and family as either ‘‘more,’’ ‘‘less,’’
or ‘‘the same.’’ A final question required patients to
rate the likelihood of experiencing chemotherapyrelated nausea compared with other cancer patients
with the same diagnosis and undergoing the same
treatment, again as ‘‘more,’’ ‘‘less,’’ or ‘‘the same.’’
These 4 expectancy questions were then combined
by averaging z-scores to produce a single expectancy
measure.
Postchemotherapy nausea was assessed via a 4day patient diary developed by Burish et al.30 and
Carey and Burish31 specifically for this purpose. The
diary required the patients to rate the severity of
their nausea on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (‘‘not
at all nauseated’’) to 7 (‘‘extremely nauseated’’) for
the morning, afternoon, evening, and night separately for the 4 days after their first chemotherapy
treatment. The diary was then used to calculate average nausea over this period as well as peak nausea,
classified as the highest severity rating for nausea at
any time in the 4 days after treatment. At the end of
the fourth day, patients were again given the FACT-G
to complete.

Statistical Analyses
Hierarchical regression was used to determine the
predictors of postchemotherapy nausea. Age, sex,
and susceptibility to motion sickness comprised the
first step, followed by diagnosis, study arm, baseline
QoL, and, finally, expectancy. Diagnosis was dummy
coded using breast cancer as the reference group
and combining myeloma, endometrial, sarcoma, and

bladder cancer patients into a single group because
of their low numbers. To assess the impact of level of
expectancy on nausea, we created 4 approximately
equal groups using quartiles based on the combined
expectancy measure. We classified the groups as not
expectant (0–25th percentile), slightly expectant (26–
50th percentile), somewhat expectant (50–75th percentile), and highly expectant (76–100th percentile).
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was then used to
compare these groups with follow-up pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure to control
the Type I error rate. Hierarchical regression was
used to assess the impact of postchemotherapy nausea on QoL. Here, age and sex were entered as the
first step, followed by study arm, then baseline QoL,
and then nausea in the final step. Finally, partial correlation was used to assess the relation between QoL
before treatment and expectancy, controlling for age,
sex, susceptibility to motion sickness, and diagnosis.
The analyses were conducted separately for average
nausea and peak nausea. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 12.0; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill) and the results were considered significant when P < .05.

RESULTS
In all, 691 patients enrolled in the study, of which
671 provided evaluable data with an average age of
53 years (range, 25–90 years). The majority of these
patients were female (94%) and white (88%), and had
received some college education (59%). Approximately 90% had breast cancer, 9% had lymphoma,
and the remaining 1% had a mix of myeloma, endometrial, sarcoma, and bladder cancers.

Overview of Nausea and QoL
In all, 562 patients (84%) reported at least some nausea in the 4 days after treatment and 165 (25%)
reported severe nausea (rating of 6 or 7 on the 7point scale). Overall, mean nausea during the 4 days
after chemotherapy was 2.2 (standard deviation
[SD] 5 1.2) and the mean peak nausea was 4.0
(SD 5 2.1). Before their first chemotherapy treatment, patients had a mean QoL of 86.3 (SD 5 13.0),
which decreased to 76.3 (SD 5 15.8) after the treatment.
Expectancy and Nausea
For average nausea, the overall model in which age,
sex, diagnosis, susceptibility to motion sickness,
baseline QoL, and expectancy were included was significant and accounted for 16% of the variance
(R2 5 0.16; F8,659 5 15.3 [P < .001]) (Table 1). Expect-

ancy had a significant impact on average nausea.
Specifically, an increase of 1 unit on the expectancy
measure was associated with a 0.27 increase in average nausea after controlling for all other variables in
the model (R2 change 5 0.02; b 5 20.27; t659 5 4.18
[P < .001]). Age and baseline QoL were the only other
significant predictors in the model. An increase in
age of 10 years corresponded to a decrease of 0.3
points on average nausea (b 5 20.03; t659 5 7.12 [P
<.001]), and a 10-point increase in baseline QoL corresponded to a 0.1 decrease in average nausea
(b 5 20.008; t659 5 2.26 [P 5 .02]).
For peak nausea, the overall model was also significant and accounted for 15% of the variance
(R2 5 0.15; F8,659 5 14.3 [P < .001]) (Table 1). Expectancy was again significant after controlling for all
other variables. Here, an increase of 1 unit on the expectancy measure corresponded to a 0.43 increase
in peak nausea (R2 change 5 0.02; b 5 20.43;
t659 5 3.86 [P < .001]). Similar to average nausea, age
and baseline QoL were also found to be significant
predictors. A 10-year increase in age was associated
with a 0.51 decrease in peak nausea (b 5 20.05;
t659 5 6.97 [P < .001]). A 10-point increase in baseline
QoL corresponded to a 0.1 decrease in peak nausea
(b 5 20.01; t659 5 1.98 [P < .048]). In addition, lymphoma patients reported 0.84 points less peak nausea
than breast cancer patients (b 5 20.84; t659 5 2.28

657

[P < .02]). Overall, expectancy accounted for 2% of the
variance in both average nausea and peak nausea after
controlling for all other variables.

Level of Expectancy and Nausea
Figure 1A shows average nausea across the different
levels of expectancy. The ANCOVA, with age, sex, susceptibility to motion sickness, diagnosis, baseline
QoL, and study group as covariates, revealed that average nausea differed significantly as a function of
level of expectancy (F3,658 5 8.9; P < .001). Using
pairwise comparisons, highly expectant patients
reported significantly higher levels of average nausea
than all other levels of expectancy. Specifically, highly
expectant patients reported average nausea as
0.62 points higher than not expectant patients
(t658 5 4.49; P < .001), 0.56 points higher than slightly
expectant patients (t658 5 4.12; P < .001), and 0.47
points higher than somewhat expectant patients
(t658 5 3.61; P 5 .002). There were no significant differences in average nausea noted between somewhat
expectant, slightly expectant, and not expectant
patients (highest t659 5 1.18; P 5 1).
Figure 1B shows peak nausea for each level of
expectancy. As with average nausea, the ANCOVA
revealed significant differences in peak nausea as a
function of level of expectancy (F3658 5 6.5; P < .001).
Highly expectant patients reported peak nausea 0.94
points higher than not expectant patients (t658 5 3.88;
P 5 .001), 0.91 points higher than slightly expectant
patients (t658 5 3.76; P 5 .001), and 0.63 higher than
somewhat expectant patients (t658 5 2.81; P 5 .03).
Again, there were no differences between somewhat
expectant, slightly expectant, and not expectant
patients in terms of peak nausea (highest t658 5 1.41;
P 5 .96).
Expectancy and Pretreatment QoL
The partial correlation between expectancy and pretreatment QoL was significant (r 5 20.29; t660 5 7.79
[P < .001]). This means that, after controlling for age,
gender, susceptibility to motion sickness, and diagnosis, stronger expectancy for postchemotherapy nausea
was associated with lower QoL before treatment.
Impact of Nausea on Posttreatment QoL
The overall model, with age, sex, baseline QoL, average nausea, and peak nausea included, was significant and accounted for 55% of the variability in
postchemotherapy QoL (R2 5 0.55; F8657 5 100
[P < .001]). The only 2 significant predictors in the
final model (Table 2) were baseline QoL (b 5 0.58;
t657 5 17.6 [P < .001]) and average nausea (b 5 25.1;
t657 5 8.80 [P < .001]). This means that even after

controlling for age, sex, diagnosis, baseline QoL,
study group, and peak nausea, a 1-point increase in
average nausea corresponded to a 5-point decrease
in postchemotherapy QoL. Peak nausea was found to
be marginally nonsignificant (b 5 20.65; t657 5 1.92
[P 5 .056]). Together, average and peak nausea
accounted for 20% of the variability in postchemotherapy QoL (R2 change 5 0.20; F2657 5 143
[P < .001]).

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 1. Covariate-adjusted mean ( standard error of the mean) (A)
average and (B) peak nausea by level of expectancy. Highly expectant
individuals reported both more average nausea and higher peak nausea than
all other expectancy levels. Asterisk indicates P <.05; double asterisk,
P <.01; triple asterisk, P <.001. No other differences were statistically
significant.

As with previous studies,1,14–18 patient expectancies
for nausea before chemotherapy were a significant
predictor of the actual occurrence of nausea after
treatment. Although expectancies accounted for only
2% of the variance in both average and peak nausea,
this was after controlling for age, sex, susceptibility
to motion sickness, and QoL. As such, these results
demonstrate an independent contribution of expectancy to postchemotherapy nausea and thereby provide strong support for expectancy as a causal factor
in chemotherapy-related nausea.
A novel and interesting finding was that patients
classified as highly expectant of nausea experienced
higher levels of both average and peak nausea than
all other levels of expectancy, whereas none of the
other lower levels of expectancy (somewhat expectant, slightly expectant, and not expectant) were
found to differ significantly from one another. This
suggests that patients who are highly expectant of
experiencing nausea are particularly at risk of actually experiencing nausea after their chemotherapy
treatment, whereas those with lower levels of expectancy share a similar decreased risk. This was also after controlling for age, sex, susceptibility to motion
sickness, and QoL, and again points to a causal influence of expectancy on postchemotherapy nausea.

Expectancy, QoL, and Nausea/Colagiuri et al.

A second novel finding was that stronger
expectancies for nausea were associated with lower
QoL before treatment. Here, the direction of causality is uncertain. It is possible that having strong
expectancies for nausea after chemotherapy could
detract from QoL before treatment by creating
apprehension and stress regarding the treatment.
Conversely, it could be that those with lower QoL
before treatment are in a poorer state of health and
therefore expect to be affected more by the chemotherapy treatment.
Increases in average nausea resulted in poorer
QoL posttreatment, a result also consistent with previous research.7–11 Here, a 1-point increase in average nausea corresponded to a 5-point decrease in
QoL. Interestingly, peak nausea did not have a significant impact on QoL after controlling for average
nausea. This tends to suggest that the continued presence of nausea has a more debilitating impact on
chemotherapy patients’ QoL compared with a severe
bout of nausea. Overall, average nausea and peak
nausea independently of other variables accounted
for 20% of the variability in postchemotherapy QoL,
a very large effect. Clearly, not only does nausea
remain prevalent, it also continues to be a significant
burden to cancer patients’ QoL.
Given the findings of the current study, patient
expectancies reflect a possible point of intervention
to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea as well as
to improve cancer patients’ QoL. A variety of studies
in areas other than oncology have already shown
that expectancy manipulations can have a beneficial
impact on health outcomes. Perhaps most relevant is
evidence that enhancing positive expectancies can
lead to decreased postoperative nausea in patients
undergoing major gynecologic surgery32 and protect
against seasickness in naval cadets.33 However, these
types of manipulations may be more difficult to
implement for cancer patients. First, it would be
unethical to provide patients with unrealistically low
expectancies regarding the likelihood of experiencing
nausea as a result of their chemotherapy. Second, in
addition to what cancer patients are told to expect
from their treating health professionals, they will also
draw on information from their family, friends, and
the media as well as any prior experience of nausea,
such as motion sickness, morning sickness, and
medication-induced nausea. As such, any successful
expectancy manipulation would have to consider the
source of the patient’s expectancies and the significance attributed to that source before attempting to
adjust any maladaptive expectancies.
The finding that highly expectant patients experience more nausea than not expectant, slightly ex-

659

pectant, and somewhat expectant patients, and that
these latter 3 groups did not differ significantly from
each other, may provide an answer. It suggests that
completely eradicating expectancies for nausea is not
necessary to gain a significant clinical improvement.
For example, if a patient was initially highly expectant but through discussion or some other manipulation became somewhat expectant, a significant
decrease in both average nausea and peak nausea
would be expected with a corresponding improvement in QoL. Further reducing these expectancies to
the level of slightly expectant, however, would produce only minimal additional benefit. Thus, a successful intervention might focus on patients that are
highly expectant of experiencing nausea with the aim
reducing these maladaptive expectancies rather than
removing all expectancy. In doing so, the patient
would remain aware that there is a possibility of
experiencing nausea, thereby avoiding any ethical
concerns regarding giving patients unrealistically low
expectations of experiencing nausea. Furthermore, a
small reduction in expectancy is likely to be much
easier to achieve than convincing a highly expectant
patient that he/she is very unlikely to experience
nausea after chemotherapy.
One possibility along these lines is to include a
discussion of the patient’s expectancies regarding
side effects as part of the chemotherapy education.
This would allow for the identification of highly expectant patients and provide an excellent opportunity to discuss and challenge these potentially
maladaptive expectancies. Given the correlation
between expectancy and pretreatment QoL, reducing
strong expectancies for nausea during chemotherapy
education may also improve patients’ pretreatment
QoL. To the best of our knowledge, patient expectancies are rarely, if ever, addressed in chemotherapy
education.
Some caution is required when interpreting the
relation between expectancy and postchemotherapy
nausea. Although we included susceptibility to
motion sickness in our analysis, which did not
appear to influence postchemotherapy nausea, it is
possible that other previous experiences of nausea,
such as morning sickness or medication-induced
nausea, did contribute to the patients’ postchemotherapy nausea. That is, the relation between expectancy and postchemotherapy nausea could arise
from the patients’ other prior experiences of nausea,
either because of a higher susceptibility to nausea in
general or as a result of conditioning. If this were the
case, expectancy may simply have acted as a marker
for history of nausea rather than having a direct

660

causal impact on postchemotherapy nausea. Montgomery and Bovbjerg,34 however, failed to find a
correlation between chemotherapy patients’ lifetime
history of nausea, including susceptibility to motion
sickness and nausea during pregnancy, and expectancies for experiencing postchemotherapy nausea.
This suggests that patients’ expectancies for postchemotherapy nausea may be independent of their previous experiences of nausea in other settings.
However, because their analysis included a very
small sample (only 31 patients), this finding must be
considered preliminary at best and warrants further
investigation.
In conclusion, the current study findings provide
further evidence that expectancy contributes to the
development of postchemotherapy nausea, which, in
addition to being inherently unpleasant, also detracts
from patients’ QoL. Given that highly expectant
patients appear at particular risk of experiencing
postchemotherapy nausea, an effective preventive
strategy might be to target these patients. Including
a discussion of expectancies for nausea during chemotherapy education reflects a possibility that would
have the added benefit of allowing direct exploration
of the sources of these expectancies.
