Abstract
Estrogen receptor A (ER) and p53 are critical prognostic
indicators in breast cancer. Loss of functional p53 is
correlated with poor prognosis, ER negativity, and resistance
to antiestrogen treatment. Previously, we found that p53
genotype was correlated with ER expression and response to
tamoxifen in mammary tumors arising in mouse mammary
tumor virus–Wnt-1 transgenic mice. These results lead us to
hypothesize that p53 may regulate ER expression. To test this,
MCF-7 cells were treated with doxorubicin or ionizing
radiation, both of which stimulated a 5-fold increase in p53
expression. ER expression was also increased 4-fold over a 24h time frame. In cells treated with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting p53, expression of both p53 and ER was
significantly reduced (>60%) by 24 h. Induction of ER by DNAdamaging agents was p53 dependent as either ionizing
radiation or doxorubicin failed to up-regulate ER after
treatment with p53-targeting siRNA. To further investigate
whether p53 directly regulates transcription of the ER gene
promoter, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a
wild-type (WT) p53 expression vector along with a luciferase
reporter containing the proximal promoter of ER. In cells
transfected with WT p53, transcription from the ER promoter
was increased 8-fold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
showed that p53 was recruited to the ER promoter along with
CARM1, CBP, c-Jun, and Sp1 and that this multifactor
complex was formed in a p53-dependent manner. These data
show that p53 regulates ER expression through transcriptional control of the ER promoter, accounting for their
concordant expression in human breast cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Estrogen receptor a (ER) plays a critical role in normal breast
development and is also involved in the pathogenesis of breast
cancer (1, 2). ER expression defines a subset of cancer patients who,
in general, have a better prognosis than patients with ER-negative
tumors (3). Epidemiologic studies show a strong correlation
between ER expression and other positive indicators, such as
lower tumor grade and proliferative index. In addition, there is a
well-established relationship between ER expression in breast

tumors, response to antiestrogen treatment, and disease-free
survival (4, 5). In contrast, ER-negative tumors are more likely to
recur, develop metastases, and to have markers of poor prognosis,
including high tumor grade and proliferative index and inactivating
mutations in p53 (4–12).
Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are frequently
associated with human malignancies, including 20% to 40% of
breast cancers (7, 8). Stabilization of wild-type (WT) p53 in
response to DNA damage promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
whereas mutations in p53 lead to tumorigenesis and multiple drug
resistance in breast cancer (13–15). Like many other transcription
factors, regulation of gene expression by p53 is mediated both by
direct binding to target gene promoters and interaction with other
nuclear proteins such as activator protein, CCAAT binding protein
(CBP), and Sp1 (16, 17). The diverse nature of p53 target genes
shows p53 involvement in various pathways, including cell cycle
control (cyclin G and p21), angiogenesis (GD-AIF and thrombospondin), DNA repair (GADD45), growth factor signaling (IGFBP3), and apoptosis (bax and FAS; ref. 16).
Animal experiments performed in our laboratory showed that
p53 genotype correlated with ER expression and response to
tamoxifen in mammary tumors arising in mouse mammary tumor
virus–Wnt-1 transgenic mice. Compared with tumors in p53 WT
(+/+) mice, both ER mRNA and protein were significantly reduced
in tumors from p53 (+/ ) mice and further reduced in tumors that
had a complete loss of p53 due to loss of heterozygosity, suggesting
that expression of these two proteins is linked in mammary
cancer.1 Therefore, we hypothesized that p53 regulates ER
expression. This relationship would be expected to affect
expression of prognostic factors, including ER and progesterone
receptor, as well as tumor development and progression.
In this study, we report that p53 regulates expression of ER in
breast cancer cells. Our results show that ER gene transcription is
regulated by p53 binding to the proximal promoter in conjunction
with other transcriptional cofactors, including CARM1, CBP, c-Jun,
and Sp1. Our results also provide mechanistic insight into clinical
data demonstrating the coexpression of WT p53 and ER in human
breast cancers (9–12).

charcoal-stripped FBS to ensure steroid-free conditions. At 60% to 80%
confluence, cells were treated as indicated in figure legends. Doxorubicin
was obtained from Tocris Bioscience.
P53 small interfering RNA constructs and expression vectors. The
small interfering (si)RNA constructs used were siGENOME SMARTpool
siRNA reagents targeting p53 or negative controls, including scrambled
sequence and lamin A–targeting siRNA constructs (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). For transfection using a 6-well plate, siRNA (from 20 nmol/L
stock) or plasmid DNA (from 1 Ag/AL stock) was mixed with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM with 1% bovine serum albumin.
After incubating for 15 min, solutions were added to the cells. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were treated with doxorubicin (0–100 nmol/L)
or ionizing radiation (0–16 Gy) as indicated in figure legends. The
WT (pC53-SN3) p53 expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. Bert
Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; ref. 7).
Luciferase assays. MCF-7 or MDA-MB-453 cells were transiently
cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the ER
promoter and WT p53 expression vectors. The ERpromLuc vector was a
kind gift from Dr. Ronald Weigel (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa;
ref. 18) and contained the ER proximal promoter region from 3500 bp to
+210 bp relative to the transcription start site. Approximately 5  103 cells
per well in a 96-well plate were transfected and/or treated as indicated.
Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega).
The assay was normalized by cotransfection of a pCMV-h-gal plasmid
(Clontech) and h-galactosidase activity was measured using a h-gal assay
kit (Galacto-Light; Applied Biosystems). The control empty vector used
was pGL2 basic from Promega.
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed once with PBS. Modified
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8), 1% NP40, 0.25% Nadeoxycholate, 1 mg/mL protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich),
1 mmol/L Na-orthovanadate, and 1 mmol/L NaF] was added to plates
and cells scraped to harvest lysates. After a 15-min incubation on ice, cells
were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4jC. The supernatant was
collected and protein content was determined by BCA method (Pierce).
Aliquots were run on SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide Criterion precast
gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Pierce). After blocking the membrane with 5% dry
milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, blots were probed with an antibody to p53
(DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), ER from Zymed (Invitrogen), or
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Abcam). Secondary
antibodies used were as follows: horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antirabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technologies) for ER and GAPDH or horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for
p53. Enhanced chemiluminescence was then used to visualize protein
bands (Super Signal West Pico; Pierce). The image was captured on an
Image Station 440CF (Kodak Digital Science) using Kodak ID v3.6 software
(Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems), and protein expression was analyzed
using ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots of
ER, p53, and GAPDH were quantified by densitometry. Target protein bands
were normalized to the GAPDH band in the same sample and then
normalized to the untreated control to calculate the fold change.
Real-time quantitative PCR. RNA was extracted from whole cells using
the Absolutely RNA kit, following manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent
Technologies). cDNAs were synthesized from 5 Ag of total RNA using
random hexamers (Promega) and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp.).
Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the ABI Prizm 7700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The primers and probes
were obtained from Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems).
Samples were run in duplicate on the same plate. Target gene expression
was normalized to the reference gene, TATA binding protein, then
normalized to the untreated control to determine the fold change.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed essentially as described (19). Briefly,
8  106 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25jC
and lysed in RIPA buffer. The precleared extract was sonicated to produce
500-bp fragments and split into 2 portions; 1 was used for control input and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

the other was incubated with antibody and protein A/G beads (Pierce).
After IP, beads were washed four times with IP buffer [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton
X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl]
and eluted in sample elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mmol/L NaHCO3). For
PCR, the p21 promoter was used as a positive control (forward,
CCAGCCCTTGGATGGTTT; reverse, GCCTCCTTTCTGTGCCTGA). Primers
used for PCR from the ER promoter regions were as follows: 2094 to
1941: forward, CTGCAAAATG CTCCCAAAGT; reverse, TGTTTGGTATGAAAAGGTCACA; 350 to 289: forward, GGGGAGATCTAACAGAAAGAGAGACAA; reverse, CCCTAGATCTGTCTTTCGCG TTTAT, 128 to 40:
forward, GGGAGATCTGCCTGGAGTGATGTTTAAG; reverse, TATGAGATCTGGAGACCAGTACTTAAAG. Identical analyses on the human
GAPDH, TATA binding protein, and a-actin promoters were included as
controls (GAPDH: forward, GTCCACTGGCGTGTTCACCA; reverseGTGGCAGTGATGGCATGGAC; TATA binding protein: forward, GACCTATGCTCACACTTCTCATGG; reverse, GAACCTGCCCGACCTCACTGAA;
Actin, forward-TCGATATCCACGTGACATCCA; reverse, GCAGCATTTTTTTACCCCCTC). For ChIP studies with doxorubicin-treated cells, MCF-7 cells
were treated with 50 nmol/L doxorubicin 4 h before ChIP analysis.
Antibodies against CARM1, c-Jun, c-Fos, and Sp1 were from Upstate
(Millipore). CBP and p53 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies.
The HDM2 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, and
the RNA polymerase II antibody was obtained from Active Motif. Protein
levels of p53 and associated cofactors were determined by immunoblot with
antibodies against p53, CARM1, CBP, c-Jun, c-Fos, HDM2, or Sp1 followed by
densitometry as described above.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Numerical data are expressed as mean F SD. Two group comparisons were
analyzed by two-sided Student’s t test. Multiple group comparisons were
analyzed with ANOVA tests. p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analysis was conducted and graphical representations of the data
were plotted using Excel X for Mac.

Results
Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin up-regulate ER expression.
To test whether activation of p53 affected ER gene expression,
MCF-7 cells were treated with ionizing radiation or doxorubicin,
both of which are known to increase expression of p53 by stabilizing the protein (20). Figure 1 shows results obtained after treatment with ionizing radiation (A and B) or doxorubicin (C and D).
A 3-fold induction in p53 mRNA was detected at 4 hours after 8 Gy
of ionizing radiation, reaching a peak, 8-fold induction by 12 hours
and decreasing again by 24 hours (Fig. 1A). Ionizing radiation
similarly induced ER mRNA, although with a delayed time frame.
Ionizing radiation (8 Gy) stimulated a 3-fold increase in ER mRNA
by 8 hours, which reached a maximum 6-fold induction by 12 hours
and was maintained through 24 hours (Fig. 1A).
In addition to the effect on p53 mRNA, ionizing radiation
stimulated a 6-fold induction in p53 protein over a 12-hour time
frame (Fig. 1B) with maximal expression at 8 hours after treatment.
Ionizing radiation stimulated a concordant increase in ER protein
expression and results showed a 5-fold induction in ER protein
over the same time frame with maximal induction at 8 hours.
Protein expression in ionizing radiation–treated groups was
significantly different from the untreated control ( p V 0.01).
Although there was a trend toward dose response, the difference
between the three doses did not achieve statistical significance.
The kinetics of ER induction are consistent with published results
for p21, another p53-responsive gene (21–23). Similar results were
observed with the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. P53
mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by half an hour
( p V 0.006) and reached a peak 7-fold induction at 8 hours
( p V 0.005) after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1C). ER mRNA

expression was increased 2-fold by 4 hours and reached a 6-fold
induction by 8 hours. Doxorubicin also affected p53 and ER protein
expression. Treatment stimulated a 5-fold induction in p53 and a 4fold induction in ER protein expression compared with vehicletreated cells ( p V 0.03; Fig. 1D). A partial dose response was
observed, with the 10 nmol/L treatment group being significantly
different from both the 50 and 100 nmol/L groups, but no
difference was observed between the 50 and 100 nmol/L groups.

To investigate functional effects of the up-regulation of ER by
p53, progesterone receptor was evaluated as a downstream target
of ER. Detectable increases in progesterone receptor mRNA were
observed by 8 hours after doxorubicin treatment ( p V 0.005;
Fig. 1C). Expression of p21, a downstream target of p53, was also
significantly up-regulated by doxorubicin, starting at half an hour
after doxorubicin treatment and reaching a 7-fold peak by 8 hours,
mirroring the kinetics of p53 mRNA induction.

These results show that increased p53 mRNA expression
preceded changes in ER mRNA levels and suggest that p53 regulates
ER expression, thereby contributing to downstream signaling
pathways.
Suppression of p53 is associated with down-regulation of ER
expression. As our results showed that ER expression was
increased after doxorubicin or ionizing radiation, p53-targeting
siRNA constructs were transfected into MCF-7 cells to determine if
p53 was required for regulation of ER expression. Addition of
p53-targeting siRNA resulted in significant decreases in p53 mRNA
(Fig. 2A, top) as well as a reduction in the message level of its
downstream target, p21 (Fig. 2A, middle). ER mRNA expression was

also significantly downregulated by p53-targeting siRNA during this
timeframe (Fig. 2A, bottom). As expected, transfection of a
scrambled sequence siRNA construct did not affect expression of
p53, p21, or ER mRNA.
Addition of p53-targeting siRNA also decreased p53 protein
expression by 50% within 12 hours and 80% by 24 hours, compared
with vehicle-treated controls ( p V 0.005; Fig. 2B). ER protein
expression levels were unchanged at 12 hours but decreased 60%
by 24 hours after treatment with the p53 siRNA. Reduced levels
of both proteins persisted for 96 hours after siRNA transfection
(Fig. 2B). Nontargeting scrambled sequence and lamin A–targeting
siRNA did not affect expression of either p53 or ER proteins (data

siRNA. P53-targeting siRNA constructs inhibited p53 protein expression by f60%, which was accompanied by a 50% decrease in ER expression, as determined
by densitometry of Western blots. *, p < 0.05 for all siRNA doses versus mock-transfected control by ANOVA. Graphical results represent the means of three

Figure 3. The effects of DNA-damaging agents on ER expression are p53 dependent. Treatment with 20 nmol/L siRNA 24 h before irradiation abrogated the
stimulatory effect of 8 Gy ionizing radiation (A ) or 50 nmol/L doxorubicin (B ) on both p53 and ER protein expression. *, p < 0.05 for ionizing radiation/doxorubicin-treated
groups versus untreated control; **, p < 0.05 for p53-targeting siRNA-treated groups versus untreated control by ANOVA. Graphical results represent the means

not shown). These results indicate that targeted depletion of
p53 resulted in reduced ER expression at both the message and
protein levels.
The effects of doxorubicin and ionizing radiation on ER
expression are p53 dependent. To further investigate the
mechanism of p53 regulation of ER expression, MCF-7 cells were
first transfected with p53-targeting siRNA and then exposed to
ionizing radiation or doxorubicin. Consistent with the results in
Fig. 1, ionizing radiation stimulated a 5-fold induction of p53
protein expression over a 12-hour time frame, which was
accompanied by a 4-fold induction in ER protein (Fig. 3A).

www.aacrjournals.org

Similarly, we detected an 8-fold induction of p53 protein at
12 hours and a coincident 7-fold increase in ER expression after
doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3B). Treatment of cells with p53targeting siRNA reduced ER protein expression by >50%, similar to
results reported in Fig. 2. However, when cells were depleted of p53
by siRNA before doxorubicin or ionizing radiation treatment, ER
induction was completely blocked, indicating that up-regulation of
ER was p53 dependent.
Similar results were obtained with ZR75.1 human breast cancer
cells, which also express ER and have WT p53. In the ZR75.1 cell
line, as in MCF-7s, the up-regulation of ER by doxorubicin was

p53-dependent and targeted depletion of p53 with siRNA resulted
in decreased ER protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1).
P53 regulates the ER proximal promoter. We then transfected
MCF-7 cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing the
proximal promoter of the ER gene (ERpromLuc; ref. 18) with or
without the pC53-SN3 WT p53 expression vector (7) to determine
whether p53 directly controls transcription of the ER gene
promoter. Treatment with 50 nmol/L doxorubicin increased p53
expression (Fig. 1D) and also induced a 3-fold increase in luciferase
activity (Fig. 4A) compared with vehicle ( p < 0.001). As shown in
Fig. 4A, addition of the WT p53 expression vector pC53-SN3
stimulated an 8-fold increase in luciferase expression ( p < 0.001),
which was further increased to 12-fold by treatment with
doxorubicin ( p < 0.001 compared with ERpromLuc alone).
Experimental controls including the ERpromLuc vector alone or
in combination with the empty pGL2 basic vector (Fig. 4A and B)
did not induce luciferase expression above basal levels.
To determine if p53 could regulate not only inducible activity of
the ER promoter, but also basal transcription, the p53 targeting

siRNA was transfected into untreated MCF-7 cells. Addition of
p53-targeting siRNA resulted in a 48% ( p = 0.009) decrease in basal
expression of the ERpromLuc construct (Fig. 4A, inset). These data
support our earlier results showing that ER expression was
decreased after siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 (Fig. 3) and
show that p53 contributes to basal as well as doxorubicin-inducible
ER expression.
To better define the effect of p53 on transcriptional activity of
the ER gene promoter, experiments were also conducted in the
p53-null MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell line. In the absence of
endogenous p53, doxorubicin treatment was unable to induce ER
promoter activity in these cells (Fig. 4B). However, addition of WT
p53 (pC53-SN3) stimulated a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity,
which was enhanced to 14-fold by doxorubicin, compared with the
ERpromLuc vector alone. These results show that p53 regulated ER
expression in breast cancer cells by increasing transcriptional
activity at the proximal promoter.
P53 binds to the ER promoter. To investigate the mechanism
whereby p53 regulates the ER gene promoter activity, ChIP assays

Transcriptional Regulation of ERa in Breast Cancer Cells

Figure 5. p53 recruitment to the proximal ER promoter is enhanced after doxorubicin treatment. A, p53 associated with the ER promoter in three regions, but
recruitment to the region 128 to 40 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site is enhanced by 50 nmol/L doxorubicin treatment. Recruitment to the promoter region
for p21 was used as a positive control and promoters for a-actin and TATA binding protein (TBP ) genes were used as negative control regions. B, in ChIP assays,
p53 coimmunoprecipitated with CARM1, CBP, c-Jun, c-Fos, HDM2, and Sp1. C, ChIP assays using CARM1, Sp1, c-Jun, and CBP antibodies verified that each of these
cofactors was also recruited to the 128 to 40 bp region of the ER promoter after doxorubicin treatment. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with 20 nmol/L p53-targeting
siRNA, but not nontargeting siRNA, blocked association of each of these cofactors to the 128 to 40 bp region of the ER promoter in response to 50 nmol/L
doxorubicin (dox/siRNA versus dox lanes). D, ChIP assays using a RNA pol II antibody verified that this component of the basal transcription machinery was recruited
to the 128 to 40 bp region of the ER promoter after doxorubicin treatment. IB, immunoblot.

were used. A recent report indicates that the sequences between
350 bp to 289 bp and 128 bp to 40 bp upstream of the
transcriptional start site are involved in transcriptional activity of
the ER gene (24). Accordingly, three promoter regions were
investigated in these experiments, including the previously
identified 350 to 289 and 128 to 40 bp sequences, as well
as a further upstream sequence spanning from 2094 to 1941 bp.
Because our results showed that doxorubicin treatment upregulated ER mRNA in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D), we reasoned that
this treatment would stimulate p53 recruitment to the ER
promoter. ChIP assays using a p53 antibody showed that p53 was

recruited to the 128 to 40 bp region of the proximal promoter in
response to doxorubicin (Fig. 5A). P53 was also detected at the
distal regions of the ER promoter ( 2094 to 1941 bp and 350 to
289 bp), but these associations were not altered by doxorubicin
treatment. As anticipated, after exposure to doxorubicin, p53 was
also immunoprecipitated at the p21 promoter but not at the
a-actin or TATA binding protein gene promoters.
To identify additional members of the ER-regulating transcriptional complex, coimmunoprecipitations were conducted using
antibodies that target several potential cofactors. It was recently
reported that CARM-1, CBP, and p53 coimmunoprecipitate in

glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and cooperatively bind
at the GADD45 gene promoter (25). Furthermore, in silico analyses
identified activating transcription factor (AP-1), CBP, and Sp1
response elements within the ER promoter regions described above
(Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 5B, CARM1, CBP, c-Jun, and Sp1 were
detected in complexes immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody after
doxorubicin treatment. In contrast, the amount of HDM2 protein
coimmunoprecipated with p53 decreased after doxorubicin treatment, consistent with its role as a negative regulator of p53
expression (26, 27). Interestingly, c-Fos did not coimmunoprecipitate with p53 after doxorubicin treatment, indicating that c-Jun
was associated with the p53 either as a homodimer or with AP-1
proteins other than c-Fos, perhaps with other members of the Jun,
Fos, AP-1, or JDP families.
ChIP assays, using antibodies directed against CARM1, CBP,
c-Jun, and Sp1, revealed that these four proteins were also recruited
to the 128 to 40 bp region of the ER promoter after treatment
with doxorubicin (Fig. 5C). Like p53, binding of all of these
cofactors with upstream promoter regions of ER ( 2094 to 1941
and 350 to 289) was not altered by doxorubicin treatment (data
not shown).
To determine whether p53 was required for binding of CARM1,
CBP, c-Jun, and Sp1 to the ER promoter, MCF-7 cells were treated
with p53-targeting siRNA constructs followed by ChIP analysis. As
shown in Fig. 5C, doxorubicin did not stimulate p53/CARM1/CBP/
c-Jun/Sp1 complex formation or DNA binding in cells transfected
with p53 siRNA, indicating that p53 was required for assembly of
the complex on the 128 to 40 bp region of the ER promoter. To
further demonstrate that the 128 to 40 bp region of the ER
gene promoter is critical for p53-mediated induction of transcriptional activity, the association of RNA polymerase II was assessed.
Pol II binding to the 128 to 40 promoter was enhanced after
doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5D, Dox lane) and, as expected, pol II
was not recruited to the upstream regions ( 350 to 289; 2094
to 1941) of the promoter after doxorubicin treatment. These
results further show that the 128 to 40 bp region is involved
in doxorubicin-induced, p53-mediated transcription of the ER
promoter.

Discussion
In this study, up-regulation of p53 by DNA-damaging agents,
such as ionizing radiation or doxorubicin, resulted in increased
ER mRNA and protein expression, whereas siRNA-mediated p53
knockdown reduced ER expression. P53 was shown to directly
regulate the ER promoter, as both endogenous as well as

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

transiently expressed p53 increased transcriptional activation of
the ER gene promoter in luciferase assays. Furthermore, p53 was
recruited to the ER gene promoter as a part of a regulatory
complex that included CARM1, CBP, c-Jun, and Sp1. Our analysis of
the ER promoter showed that although there are response
elements for Sp1, AP-1, and CBP, no p53 consensus response
element was present in the proximal promoter, suggesting that
p53 regulates the ER gene through protein-protein interactions
(24). Furthermore, our data demonstrate that p53 was required for
assembly of this complex as well as for induction of ER expression
by doxorubicin.
There is accumulating evidence of crosstalk between growth
promoting and growth prohibiting pathways, such as those
demonstrated here involving ER and p53. Evidence indicates that
ER signaling increases expression and nuclear accumulation of
p53 in vitro and in vivo (28–30). Recapitulation of the hormonal
milieu of pregnancy by exposing rats to estrogen plus progesterone induces nuclear accumulation of p53 in mammary epithelium
and protects against carcinogen challenge (31–33). Although this
literature represents substantial evidence that ER regulates p53
expression, the converse regulation of ER by p53 has not been
studied and a mechanism linking ER expression with WT p53 is
virtually unexplored. Although clinical and epidemiologic studies
have shown that ER-positive human breast cancers express WT
p53 and tumors with inactivating mutations in p53 tend to be ER
negative, evidence for a direct transcriptional mechanism has
been lacking. Results presented here show that p53 regulates the
ER promoter in breast cancer cells and provide a possible
explanation for the epidemiologic findings that ER expression is
associated with WT p53 in human breast cancers.
P53 is a widely recognized tumor suppressor gene, which limits
proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (34, 35).
Intriguingly, recent reports suggest that p53 may also play a role in
regulating genes involved in promotion of cell growth. Specifically,
p53 mediates induction of cyclooxygenase-2, transforming growth
factor-a, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like growth
factor, all of which stimulate growth of normal and neoplastic cells
(36–38). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that ER and
p53 are associated on the promoter of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor to cooperatively enhance transcriptional activation
(39). Consistent with these reports, our data suggest the presence of
a functional link between the tumor suppressor p53 and growthpromoting ER signaling pathways.
The regulation of ER transcription is complex, involving
multiple independent promoters and several alternative 5¶ exons.
Although it has previously been shown that Sp1 (40) and GATA-3

(41) are critical regulators of ER expression, the role of p53 in
mediating expression of ER remains virtually unstudied. Our
results show that despite the lack of a p53 consensus sequence,
p53 bound to the proximal ER gene promoter along with CARM1,
CBP, c-Jun, and Sp1. Dox stimulated the p53-dependent assembly
of the transcription complex at the 128 bp to 40 bp region of
the ER proximal promoter but not at the more distal regions.
When considered along with the data showing that p53 siRNA
reduced luciferase in untreated MCF-7 cells, these results suggest
that the 2094 to 1941 and 350 to 289 regions may be
responsible for basal transcription from the ER promoter, whereas
the 128 to 40 bp region is involved in p53-inducible activity. It
has previously been reported that transcription from this proximal
promoter region [termed ‘‘promoter A’’ by Kos and colleagues (42)
and including the
128 to
40 bp region studied here]
predominates in ER-positive breast cancer cells (43, 44), but little
is known regarding why this promoter region is preferentially
used. The results presented here indicate that p53 plays a role in
use of promoter A in ER-positive breast cancers, potentially
contributing to the reported overexpression of ER in postmenopausal breast cancer compared with normal mammary tissue
(18, 43, 45).
One of the unexplained features of breast tumors with mutations
in p53 is that they frequently lack ER expression, which is correlated with lack of response to tamoxifen and poor prognosis
(9–12, 46). This is noteworthy as the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the ER-negative phenotype are not well-understood
but may include progressive loss of ER. Consistent with this is the
observation that in transgenic mice with BRCA1 mutations, early
mammary lesions are ER positive, but expression is lost during

tumor progression coincident with loss of functional p53 (47, 48).
Similarly, in human carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, breast tumors
tend to be ER negative, have mutated p53, and have a poorer
prognosis than tumors with WT BRCA (49).
Our studies have identified a transcriptional mechanism that
explains the observed correlation between p53 function and ER
expression in human breast cancers. In this report, we demonstrate
that p53 regulates ER expression, providing a mechanism to
explain the concordance of WT p53 and ER expression and the
high frequency of ER negativity observed in tumors with p53
mutations. Furthermore, these findings suggest that early mutations and/or loss of functional p53 during tumorigenesis may lead
to ER-negative breast cancers, which has consequences on tumor
progression and response to antihormonal therapies.
