ABSTRACT
Treatment options for advanced metastatic thyroid cancer patients are limited.
Vemurafenib, a BRAFV600E inhibitor, has shown promise in clinical trials although
cellular resistance occurs. Combination therapy that includes BRAFV600E inhibition
and avoids resistance is a clinical need. We used an in vitro model to examine
combination treatment with vemurafenib and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors, metformin and rapamycin. Cellular viability and apoptosis were
analyzed in thyroid cell lines by trypan blue exclusion and TUNEL assays. Combination
of vemurafenib and metformin decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in
both BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells and 8505c anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.
This combination was also found to be active in vemurafenib-resistant BCPAP cells.
Changes in expression of signaling molecules such as decreased mTOR expression
in BCPAP and enhanced inhibition of phospho-MAPK in resistant BCPAP and 8505c
were observed. The second combination of vemurafenib and rapamycin amplified
cell death in BCPAP cells. We conclude that combination of BRAFV600E and mTOR
inhibition forms the basis of a treatment regimen that should be further investigated
in in vivo model systems. Metformin or rapamycin adjuvant treatment may provide
clinical benefits with minimal side effects to BRAFV600E-positive advanced thyroid
cancer patients treated with vemurafenib.

INTRODUCTION

to be FDA-approved in the past 40 years for treatment of
radioiodine-resistant metastatic well-differentiated thyroid
cancer [1]. More recently, a second kinase inhibitor
lenvatenib was approved. Sorafenib and lenvatinib
both inhibit several protein kinases including vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Sorafenib also
inhibits RAF kinases and lenvatinib inhibits fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR), RET, and KIT. Both drugs
improved progression-free survival compared to placebo
in phase 3 trials [2, 3]. Other targeted agents currently
in clinical trials for thyroid cancer include BRAFV600E
inhibitors such as vemurafenib.
The BRAFV600E mutation is found in
approximately one-half of papillary thyroid cancers and

Most cases of thyroid cancer are treated successfully
with surgical resection, radioiodine, and thyroid hormone
therapy. However, there are few treatment options
available for patients with advanced disease including
radioiodine-resistant and metastatic differentiated thyroid
cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Only 30% of patients
with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer
and pulmonary metastasis survive 5 years after diagnosis
[1]. In addition, anaplastic thyroid cancer patients face
an average life expectancy of less than one year. Recent
progress in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer
patients includes targeted therapy. In 2013, the kinase
inhibitor sorafenib became the first drug since doxorubicin

one-fourth of anaplastic thyroid cancers and is associated
with poor prognosis [4-6]. The rationale behind targeting
BRAFV600E kinase is that this protein is specific to
cancer cells and drives the growth-promoting MAPK
pathway. Thyroid cancer cells become dependent on
BRAFV600E constitutive activation for growth, survival,
and tumor progression. Vemurafenib binds selectively
to the active site of BRAFV600E protein, which differs
in conformation from wild-type BRAF, and inhibits
downstream MAPK signaling [7]. Short-term treatment
with BRAFV600E inhibitors has drastic anti-proliferative
effects on mutated thyroid cancer cells including induction
of apoptosis [8-10]. The drug vemurafenib has also
recently proved to be useful in treating advanced thyroid
cancer patients in clinical trials.
	 In an earlier study, one patient with metastatic
thyroid cancer experienced a partial response including
reduced pulmonary lesions after treatment with
vemurafenib, and the two other patients had stable
disease [11]. Additionally, two individual case reports
documented tumor regression in response to vemurafenib
in a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer and a patient
with advanced papillary thyroid cancer [12, 13]. Brose et
al. presented results of an ongoing phase II clinical study
for vemurafenib in patients with metastatic or unresectable
BRAFV600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer at the 2013
ECCO/ESMO/ESTRO Annual Meeting. These results
also demonstrate an anti-tumor effect thus far, especially
in those patients who have not been treated with other
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Off-label use of vemurafenib
for 17 patients with BRAFV600E-positive advanced
papillary thyroid cancer was reviewed retrospectively and
found to be effective and well-tolerated [14].
While these studies collectively point out the
therapeutic potential for vemurafenib, as a single targeted
therapy it will likely not be able to prevent drug resistance
and disease progression in the long term. Combination
therapy including BRAFV600E inhibitors is a promising
option to delay or prevent resistance and further improve
therapy for BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer patients.
Researchers are now investigating combinations of
targeted inhibitors, including dabrafenib (BRAFV600E
inhibitor) and lapatinib (HER2/neu and EGFR inhibitor)
in refractory and inoperable BRAFV600E-positive thyroid
cancer. HER2/HER3 dimers were found to be increased in
thyroid cells after vemurafenib treatment and are capable
of activating several intracellular signaling pathways [15].
It is likely that activation of multiple growth-promoting
signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/Akt
contributes to development of vemurafenib resistance.
One study concluded that BRAF inhibition resistance
pathways converge to regulate translation of mRNAs
through formation of the eIF4F initiation complex [16].
Since mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major
regulator of translation via eIF4F initiation complex
formation and receives input from cell signaling pathways,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it is also a rational target for combination therapy.
In this study we investigated the combination
of vemurafenib and mTOR inhibitors, metformin and
rapamycin, which has not yet been explored in thyroid
cancer. Evidence for anti-tumor effects of metformin
alone has been accruing for several types of cancer,
although exact mechanisms are yet to be determined
and most studies involve diabetic patients. One study
found that treatment with metformin in diabetic patients
with thyroid cancer resulted in smaller tumor size and
greater chance of complete remission [17]. Studies in
the laboratory have also confirmed growth-inhibitory
effects of metformin on thyroid cancer cells [18, 19].
Metformin caused decreased cell viability and increased
apoptosis in BCPAP and BHP10-3SC papillary thyroid
cells and inhibited BHP10-3SC tumor growth in nude
mice. These effects were attributed to activation of AMP
kinase and inhibition of growth-promoting Akt and
mTOR [19]. Along with inhibition of mTOR signaling,
there are several mechanisms proposed for anti-cancer
effects of metformin including STAT3 inhibition leading
to induction of apoptosis and effects on cancer-related
miRNAs [20]. Both vemurafenib and metformin appear to
have anti-cancer effects in thyroid cancer, and it is possible
that adjuvant metformin therapy would not significantly
increase toxicity in vemurafenib-treated patients due to
its high safety profile. Thus, we investigated effects of
combination metformin and vemurafenib in thyroid cancer
cells, hypothesizing enhanced cytotoxic effects.
We also investigated the potential combination
of vemurafenib and rapamycin in thyroid cancer cells.
Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant used to prevent
organ transplant rejection, especially in kidney transplants.
It has also been researched as an anti-cancer agent due to
its anti-proliferative effects which are more potent than
its immunosuppressive effects in terms of tumor growth
[21]. Rapamycin forms a complex with cytosolic FKbinding protein 12 (FKBP12) and this complex serves
as a direct and specific inhibitor of mTOR [22-26].
The rapamycin:FKBP12 complex inhibits the signal
transduction ability of mTOR, preventing activation
of multiple targets required for progression through
cell cycle and resulting in G1 phase arrest. One phase
II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus,
a rapamycin derivative, in advanced thyroid cancers
and determined that the drug had some clinical benefit
although further study is needed [27]. Inhibition of
mTOR signaling with rapamycin in combination with
inhibition of the driver mutated kinase BRAFV600E
with vemurafenib in thyroid cancer may result in more
profound anti-proliferative effects. We hypothesized that
the combination treatment of vemurafenib with rapamycin,
similar as with metformin, may also lead to enhanced
cytotoxic effects in thyroid cancer cell lines.

RESULTS

cells was significantly lower than viable cells counted
after treatment with metformin alone (Figure 1D). Nthyori 3-1 braf-wild-type thyroid cells demonstrated no
significant changes in cell viability in response to any of
the treatments compared to untreated (Figure 1A).

Metformin alone and the metformin-vemurafenib
combination treatment significantly decrease cell
viability in BRAFV600E-positive papillary and
anaplastic thyroid cancer cells

Metformin-vemurafenib combination treatment
significantly decreases viability in vemurafenibresistant BCPAP cells

We measured viability of several thyroid cell
lines after treatment with vemurafenib, metformin, and
the combination. As expected, BRAFV600E-positive
BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells were susceptible to
vemurafenib in terms of viability, which was decreased to
50% that of untreated (Figure 1B). In addition, treatment
with metformin alone and with combination treatment of
vemurafenib and metformin decreased frequency of viable
BCPAP cells to approximately 50% of untreated cells
(Figure 1B). Although 8505c anaplastic thyroid cancer
cells were unaffected by treatment with vemurafenib,
metformin alone decreased their viability significantly
to 75% that of untreated. The metformin-vemurafenib
combination further reduced 8505c frequency of live
cells to 50% of untreated cells, and the number of viable

Another cell line evaluated was resistant BCPAP,
which was created in the laboratory by exposing BCPAP
cells to increasing concentrations of vemurafenib. As
expected, these cells were relatively resistant to treatment
with vemurafenib alone compared to normal BCPAP
(Figure 1B, 1C). Interestingly, vemurafenib-resistant
BCPAP cells also appeared to be completely resistant to
metformin, as there was no significant change in their
viability in response to treatment with this drug as a single
agent. However, the cell viability decreased significantly,
to about 50% of untreated cells after treatment with the
combination of metformin and vemurafenib (Figure 1C).

Metformin-vemurafenib combination treatment
increases frequency of apoptosis in BCPAP and
8505c cells

Rapamycin-vemurafenib combination treatment
significantly decreases viability compared to
vemurafenib alone in BCPAP cells

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, was measured
in each of the thyroid cell lines following treatment with
vemurafenib, metformin, and the combination. Terminal
Deoxynucleotide Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling
(TUNEL) was used to identify DNA strand breaks that
are characteristic of apoptotic cells [28]. In Figure 2,
cells within the gated areas represent apoptotic cells
with fragmented DNA (Figure 2A) and this percentage is
also represented graphically (Figure 2B). In the BCPAP
papillary thyroid cancer cells, some degree of apoptosis
occurred in the untreated group (11.3%) revealing the
background level of cell death under experimental
conditions. Between the vemurafenib-treated sample and
the metformin-treated sample the number of apoptotic
cells detected by this assay varied only slightly, at 12.8%
and 9.33% of total cells, respectively. However, in the
combination treatment group, BCPAP cells demonstrated
increased frequency of apoptosis with 31.0% of cells
within the gated area (Figure 2A, 2B).
Percentage of apoptotic cells changed very little
between untreated (2.5%) and vemurafenib-treated (1.6%)
samples of 8505c anaplastic thyroid cells. Metformintreated 8505c cells demonstrated a slight increase in
apoptosis (4.8%). As in the BCPAP cells, a greater than
additive effect in terms of induction of apoptosis was
observed in the 8505c cells in response to combination
treatment with metformin and vemurafenib. Drug
combination treatment resulted in 10.7% apoptotic cells
(Figure 2A, 2B). Resistant BCPAP cells in this assay
showed little variability in apoptosis, indicating that
although combination treatment with metformin and
vemurafenib inhibits growth of these cells (Figure 1C), it
does not cause overt apoptosis that can be detected by the
TUNEL assay [28] (Figure 2A, 2B).

We investigated a second possible combination
therapy of rapamycin and vemurafenib in thyroid cells.
Rapamycin serves as a direct specific inhibitor of mTOR.
In a series of viability assays, rapamycin treatment alone
had no significant effect on cell viability in all thyroid cell
lines analyzed (Figure 4). Interestingly, the combination
of rapamycin and vemurafenib decreased viability
significantly in BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells, even
compared to the vemurafenib-treated sample. Combination
treatment resulted in a profound viability decrease to only
25% that of the untreated sample (Figure 4B). In 8505c,
the difference in viability between vemurafenib-treated
and combination-treated samples was not significant
(Figure 4D). The resistant BCPAP and Nthy-ori 3-1 cells
were not susceptible to rapamycin or the combination
treatment in terms of viability (Figure 4A, 4C).

Rapamycin-vemurafenib combination treatment
increases frequency of apoptosis in BCPAP cells
To further investigate cytotoxic effects in BCPAP
cells in response to rapamycin and vemurafenib, we
conducted another TUNEL-based assay to evaluate
apoptosis. We found the percentage of apoptotic cells
increased in both vemurafenib and combination treatment
groups compared to untreated cultures (Figure 5A, 5B).
Concordant with results of viability assays, combination
treatment caused a greatly enhanced frequency of
apoptosis compared to vemurafenib treatment alone.
Percentage of apoptotic cells increased from about 40%
with vemurafenib alone to 70% with the combination of
rapamycin and vemurafenib (Figure 5B). We also detected
a large population of cells with high TUNEL staining
in the combination group seen in Figure 5A, indicating
a relative abundance of exposed 3’-hydroxyl ends of
the DNA strand breaks compared to cells treated with
vemurafenib alone. In the latter case apoptotic cells were
identified as cells with fractional DNA content (“sub-G1”
cells). Microscopically, vemurafenib-treated BCPAP cells
show distinct signs of apoptosis including chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation. The drug
combination-treated cells visualized support the finding
of increased TUNEL-positive staining measured by flow
cytometry (Figure 5C). In this assay, there were few
apoptotic cells detected in the untreated and rapamycintreated BCPAP cells (Figure 5A, 5B). BRAF- wild-type
Nthy-ori 3-1 cells were used as a negative control and did
not demonstrate appreciable apoptosis in any treatment
group (Figure 5A, 5B).

Metformin and combination treatment modulate
signaling molecules MAPK and mTOR
Effects of metformin on thyroid cancer cell
signaling pathways are largely unknown. We analyzed
expression of MAPK and mTOR in response to metformin
and combination treatment to determine whether signaling
effects could play a role in mediating anti-proliferative
effects. Co-treatment with metformin and vemurafenib led
to enhanced inhibition of phospho-MAPK expression in
resistant BCPAP and 8505c cells compared to vemurafenib
alone (Figure 3). This effect was not observed in normal
BCPAP. Effects on mTOR also varied among thyroid
cancer cell lines, as total mTOR expression decreased in
response to metformin in BCPAP and increased in 8505c
anaplastic cells (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION

cancer cell lines analyzed, including BCPAP, resistant
BCPAP, and 8505c. Induction of apoptosis was greatest in
BCPAP and also occurred in 8505c. We observed a general
pattern of decreased viability corresponding to increased
apoptosis. However, the combination treatment increased
BCPAP apoptosis compared to vemurafenib alone without
a significant change in viability between the two groups.
A likely explanation is that decreases in cell viability may
indicate decreased growth rate in response to treatment, in
addition to cell death. In BCPAP, the decrease in viability
after combination treatment can be attributed largely to
the percentage of apoptotic cells detected by TUNEL. In
the vemurafenib-treated group, decreased viability may
indicate slower growth rate or the presence of disrupted
cells without DNA strand breaks. In regard to resistant
BCPAP cells, viability decreased significantly without
a corresponding increase in apoptosis after combination
treatment. Thus, resistant BCPAP cells were susceptible
to growth-inhibitory effects of the combination treatment,
although overt apoptosis was not detected at this time
point.
It should be noted that the apparent discordance
between the viability and apoptosis assays may also
stem from the different end-points being measuring by
each. The viability (trypan blue exclusion) assay detects
cells with impaired integrity of plasma membrane that
leads to inability to exclude cationic dyes. The apoptotic
(TUNEL) assay detects cells with fragmented DNA; in
the case of early- or mid- stage of apoptosis such cells
have well preserved plasma membrane and do exclude
trypan blue [28]. It is only at the late stage of apoptosis
that integrity of plasma membrane is not preserved. A
large fraction of DNA in the latter cells is fragmented to
such small sections that they are extracted and not retained
by fixation. Having only fractional DNA content, such
cells present on the DNA content histograms as a distinct
“sub-G1” subpopulation that may be TUNEL-negative
[28].
Interestingly, both the resistant BCPAP cells and the
inherently resistant anaplastic 8505c cells demonstrated a
profound inhibition of phospho-MAPK expression. This
suggests a role for metformin in interfering with signal
transduction when combined with BRAFV600E inhibition
and may account for decreased growth in viability assays.
Resistant BCPAP cells were not susceptible to metformin
alone, indicating that a rewiring process of acquired
resistance may have enabled a distinct survival pathway
inhibited only with combination therapy. In terms of
signaling molecules, metformin also appeared to inhibit
expression of total mTOR within BCPAP papillary thyroid
cancer cells and increased expression of total mTOR in
8505c cells, regardless of the presence of vemurafenib.
Anti-proliferative effects of metformin in BCPAP cells
may be driven through diminishment of mTOR expression.
The concentration of 2 mM metformin used in
this study is relatively high compared to expected human

The use of targeted molecular therapy will
likely continue to expand as cancer treatments become
personalized and additional clinically relevant targets
are discovered. Potent inhibitors of BRAFV600E, such
as vemurafenib, show great promise for treatment of
BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer. BRAFV600E
mutation is also found in melanoma and colorectal
cancer. Studies involving metastatic melanoma patients
established that vemurafenib caused tumor regression and
significantly reduced risk of death compared to standard
dacarbazine treatment, although patients often developed
resistance and disease progression resumed after 6-8
months [29, 30]. In cases of BRAFV600E-positive
colorectal cancers, inhibition of BRAFV600E alone was
ineffective, largely due to feedback activation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) [31-34]. Recent research
in both melanoma and colorectal cancer revealed that
combination therapy including BRAFV600E inhibition
may provide greater benefits. Clinical studies thus far
include targeting molecules that fall directly within the
canonical MAPK pathway, such as MEK in melanoma [35,
36] and molecules that are membrane receptors activated
due to feedback mechanisms, such as EGFR in colorectal
cancer [37]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with
targeted therapy are also being considered in melanoma
[38]. In this study, we investigated the combination of
BRAFV600E inhibition and mTOR inhibition in thyroid
cancer cells. The two mTOR inhibitors we chose are both
clinically available with known pharmacokinetics and
with somewhat differing mechanisms of action.
Metformin transiently inhibits the respiratory chain
complex 1 in mitochondria and this leads to an increase
in ratio of AMP to ATP, thereby triggering activation
of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK): the latter
subsequently leads to mTOR inhibition [39-42]. Actions
of metformin in cancer cells may also include reducing
expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis
as well as membrane tyrosine kinase receptors [42-44].
The combination of vemurafenib and metformin is an
example of a strategy to combine therapies that target both
the driver mutation BRAFV600E and more broadly inhibit
critical cellular signaling pathways related to metabolism.
It has been proposed that resistance to targeted therapy
can be mediated by rewiring of cellular metabolism [45].
If changes in metabolism contribute to resistance, cotreatment with agents that alter cellular energy balance
may hinder development of resistance or be effective
against resistant tumors, as suggested by our results
in thyroid cancer cells. Further elucidation of the link
between driver mutations, resistance to targeted therapy
and metabolism may build upon new avenues for cancer
therapies.

vemurafenib proved to be effective at inhibiting all thyroid

plasma levels of around 10-40 µM after receiving a
standard therapeutic dose. Similar concentrations (1-20
mM) were required for AMPK activation in a prior study
investigating metformin and vemurafenib in melanoma
cells. It was proposed that low expression levels of
OCT1 transporter in cultured cells may account for this
difference, which may also be the case for our thyroid
cancer cell lines [46]. Data highlights a connection of
metformin to cell signaling pathways. Further research
defining the wide-ranging effects of metformin at different
concentrations and within different cell types is needed.
The prior investigation with melanoma found
synergistic anti-proliferative effects of vemurafenib
and metformin in the majority of BRAFV600E-positive
cell lines, although some antagonistic effects were also
seen [46]. In another study, a similar biguanide drug,
phenformin, demonstrated cooperative effects to inhibit
proliferation when combined with BRAFV600E inhibition
in melanoma cells and also delayed development of
resistance [47]. Although limited to an in vitro system,
our study provides evidence that combination of targeted
BRAFV600E inhibition with broader inhibition provided
by metformin causes greater than additive inhibition of
thyroid cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis.
Further in vivo studies may lead to benefits for patients
with advanced BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer. This
is an especially appealing combination because of the
widespread use and low side effects of metformin seen in
patients treated for diabetes mellitus type 2.
The second inhibitor, rapamycin, directly inhibits
mTOR complex 1. Combination treatment with rapamycin
and vemurafenib proved to be effective only in BCPAP
papillary thyroid cancer cells, possibly due to rapamycin’s
more targeted mechanism of action. Resistant BCPAP cells
and anaplastic 8505c cells are likely better adapted to thrive
in the face of targeted inhibition due to the availability
of alternative signaling pathways. It is noteworthy that
the combination of rapamycin and vemurafenib resulted
in very marked induction of apoptosis in BCPAP,
accounting for the decrease in viability. Apoptotic cells
made up 70% of all detected BCPAP cells and there was
a large population of cells intensely stained with TUNEL,
indicative of intensive DNA fragmentation and advanced
progression of apoptosis [28]. The profound interaction
of vemurafenib and rapamycin seen in BCPAP cells
alone reflects cell-specific sensitivity based on the wiring
pattern of BRAFV600E-mediated signal transduction.
Exquisite sensitivity to combination treatment targeting
BRAFV600E and a downstream integrative molecule such
as mTOR may be seen in a defined population of cancer
cells, as in the case of BCPAP cells.
Sensitivity of differentiated papillary thyroid cancer
cells to rapamycin and vemurafenib treatment could be
exploited clinically by treating with combination therapy
early on in a patient’s clinical course, before resistance
to vemurafenib develops. Combinations of vemurafenib
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and mTOR inhibitors should be further studied on human
cancer xenografts on immunodeficient mice, to evaluate in
vivo effects and potential clinical benefits for treatment of
advanced thyroid cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
Thyroid cell lines used in this study include a
normal transformed line (Nthy-ori 3-1), a papillary thyroid
cancer cell line (BCPAP), and an anaplastic thyroid cancer
cell line (8505c). Dr. Norman L. Eberhardt (Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, MN) generously gifted the Nthy-ori 3-1 cell
line. BCPAP and 8505c cell lines were purchased from
DSMZ in Braunschweig, Germany. All cell lines were
cultured in Rosswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
penicillin 10, 000 IU/mL, streptomycin 10, 000 μg/mL,
and 2 mM L-glutamine.

Resistant BCPAP cell line
In order to create vemurafenib-resistant BCPAP
cells, cells were treated for 24 hours with increasing
concentrations of vemurafenib (Chemietek, Indianapolis,
IN) up to 16 µM, subcultured and allowed to grow to 70%
confluence before the next treatment. Cells were treated
with vemurafenib concentrations of 10 µM, 12 µM, 14
µM, and 16 µM over a period of 45 days. The resistant
BCPAP cells were maintained in culture with intermittent
treatments of 16 µM vemurafenib.

Trypan blue exclusion assay
Cells were plated in six-well culture plates and
allowed to adhere overnight. Each well contained 200,000
cells (8505c) or 300,000 cells (Nthy-ori 3-1, BCPAP,
resistant BCPAP) in 2 mL media at the start of the
experiment. Complete media was replaced with phenolred-free RPMI containing 5% charcoal dextran-treated
FBS +/- 2 mM metformin and plates were incubated for 24
hours. Cells were then treated with +/- 10 µM vemurafenib
for 36 hours before viable cells were counted as cells
unable to take up 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma). For
the rapamycin experiment, the same protocol was followed
except cells were treated for 24 hours with phenol-red-free
RPMI containing 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS for 24
hours and then this media was replaced with fresh media
containing +/- 10 µM vemurafenib, +/- 1 µM rapamycin
for 36 hours. Trypan blue exclusion assays were repeated
at least once in triplicates.

times with TBST for 5 minutes per wash and incubated
with secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature.
After 4 TBST washes of 10 minutes each, membranes
were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo
Scientific) and detected on x-ray film.

Thyroid cells were plated in 6-well plates at 300,000
cells per well (Nthy-ori 3-1, BCPAP, and resistant BCPAP)
or 200,000 cells per well (8505c) and allowed to adhere
overnight. Complete media was replaced with 5% charcoal
dextran-treated FBS +/- 2 mM metformin and plates were
incubated for 24 hours. Cells were then treated with +/- 10
µM vemurafenib for 36 hours. Cells were collected and
fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour on
ice. Cells were washed with PBS twice and resuspended
in 70% ethanol. Cells in solution were subjected to the
APO-BRDU protocol (Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc., San
Diego, CA). BrdU incorporated into DNA at the site of
breaks was detected by anti-BrdU antibody labeled with
Alexa Fluor 488 dye. Total cellular DNA was stained with
DAPI. While most apoptotic cells were TUNEL-(Alexa
Fluor 488)- positive, following some treatments they were
also identified as the cells with fractional DNA content
(“sub-G1” cells) [28, 48]. For the rapamycin experiment,
the same protocol was followed except cells were treated
for 24 hours with phenol-red-free RPMI containing 5%
charcoal dextran-treated FBS and then media was replaced
with fresh media containing +/- 10 µM vemurafenib
and +/- 1 µM rapamycin for 36 hours. Intensity of
cellular fluorescence was measured using a MoFlo XDP
(Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA) high speed flow cytometer/
sorter. DAPI fluorescence was excited with the UV laser
(355 nm), AlexaFluor 488, with the argon ion (488 nm)
laser, as described earlier [49].

Immunofluorescence
Cell suspensions from the APO-BrdU TUNEL assay
were prepared for viewing on glass slides by cytospin.
Slides were viewed and images were captured using
Axiovision Rel 4.8 on the Axiovert 200 M microscope
(Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY).

Western blot
Thyroid cells were allowed to grow in T75 flasks
until 70% confluence. Complete media was replaced
with 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS-containing
media +/- 2 mM metformin and flasks were incubated
for 24 hours before +/- 10 µM vemurafenib treatment
for an additional 24 hours. After treatment, cells were
collected by gentle scraping with cell scrapers, subjected
to radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50mM TrisHCl[pH 7.4], 150mM NaCl, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% NP40, and
1 μM Pefabloc) and vortexed every 5 minutes for 30
minutes over ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm
for 30 minutes at 4°C and each supernatant was collected.
Volumes containing 10 µg protein per sample were
subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
as in our prior studies [50, 51]. Proteins on gels were
transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for 2 hours at 220
mA in a transfer chamber. Membranes were blocked with
5% milk in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM
NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1.5 hours at room temperature
and then incubated overnight in primary antibodies (Cell
Signaling) at 4° Celsius. Membranes were washed three
