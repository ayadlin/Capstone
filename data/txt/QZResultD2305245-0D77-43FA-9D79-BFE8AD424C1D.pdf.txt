BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to identify mediators of the effects of a combined resistance and aerobic
exercise program on perceived physical and general health in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.
METHODS: In total, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy were randomly assigned to 12 weeks
of resistance and aerobic exercise or usual care. The outcome measures of physical and general health were assessed by standardized
questionnaires. Linear regression analyses were conducted on the residual change scores of the variables. The mediating effects of fatigue, muscle strength, and functional performance on the intervention’s effect on physical and general health were examined using
the product of coefficients method. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: The exercise intervention was found to significantly improve physical (beta, 5.03; 95% CI, 1.01-9.04) and general health (beta, 12.89; 95% CI,
2.24-23.54). Upper body muscle strength and walking speed significantly mediated the intervention effect on physical health (beta,
2.65; 95% CI, 0.64-5.54), accounting for 53% of the total effect. Walking speed and fatigue were found to be mediators in the intervention effect on general health (beta, 7.52; 95% CI, 2.16-16.92), accounting for 51% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effects on physical and general health were explained by different mediating mechanisms. Walking speed mediated the
intervention effect on both physical and general health. The intervention effect on physical health was further mediated by upper

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in males, accounting for 14% of new cancer cases.1
Five-year survival rates in Western countries are between 85% and 99%.2-4 A common treatment for prostate cancer
involves the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), achieved either by administering luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone antagonists and=or antiandrogen medication, or by surgical castration.5 However, ADT has been associated
with several adverse effects, including loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, increased fat mass, reduced bone mass,
and an increased risk of developing osteoporosis and skeletal fractures, which may result in substantial reductions in physical function, independence, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).6-9 HRQoL is a multidimensional construct that
includes self-reported measures of physical and mental health.10,11
Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken in men receiving ADT for prostate cancer demonstrated
that physical exercise may counteract ADT-related adverse effects.12-15 In a previous RCT among 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT, we reported that a 12-week program of resistance and aerobic exercise was able to increase
lean body mass; improve muscle strength, endurance, and functional performance; and reduce fatigue compared with
usual care.13 In addition, improvements in some aspects of HRQoL (ie, general and physical health) were reported by

men from the exercise group compared with men from
the control group.13 To the best of our knowledge, the
mechanisms (ie, mediators) underlying improvements in
self-reported physical and general health are unclear.
Insight into mediators of exercise programs is important
for identifying and subsequently targeting intervention
components to improve their effectiveness and efficiency.16-18 It may, for example, help to identify which
aspects of a physical exercise intervention (eg, muscle
strength, aerobic capacity) are most relevant for improving specific HRQoL outcomes.
To date, very few studies have addressed mediators
of the effects of exercise interventions in patients with cancer. In previous uncontrolled trials in patients with cancer,
the association between physical fitness and function and
HRQoL was mediated by fatigue.19,20 Among patients
with breast cancer, exercise familiarity and self-efficacy
mediated the exercise intervention effect on HRQoL.21
No studies on the mediators of the effects of physical exercise on HRQoL in patients with prostate cancer have been
published to date. Therefore, the purpose of the current
study was to identify mediators of the effects of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program on perceived physical and general health in men undergoing
ADT for prostate cancer.

resistance training within the previous 3 months. Detailed
recruitment procedures have been described elsewhere.13
After completion of the baseline assessment, 57 men
(response rate, 66%) were randomly assigned to the exercise (29 men) or usual-care control (28 men) groups. Participants in the exercise group undertook combined
progressive resistance and aerobic exercise training twice a
week for 12 weeks. The resistance exercises included chest
press, seated row, shoulder press, triceps extension, leg
press, leg extension, leg curl, and abdominal crunch. Sessions commenced and concluded with general flexibility
exercises. The resistance exercise program was designed to
progress from 12- to 6-repetition maximum (maximum
weight that could be lifted with correct technique for the
specified number of repetitions) for 2 to 4 sets per exercise. Aerobic exercises included 15 to 20 minutes of cycling and walking=jogging at 65% to 80% of the
maximum heart rate and perceived exertion at 11 to 13 on
the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (6-20 points).
Sessions were conducted in small groups of 1 to 5 participants under direct supervision of an exercise physiologist.
The control group consisted of usual care without additional attention or support. During the course of the
study, participants were encouraged to maintain customary activity.
Outcome Measures

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study used data from an RCT evaluating the
effects of a combined resistance and endurance exercise
program on physical function and HRQoL in men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer without bone metastases.13
Detailed descriptions of the procedures and the main
effects of the intervention on muscle strength, functional
performance, lean body mass, blood biomarkers, and
HRQoL are described elsewhere.13 Briefly, the study was
a 2-armed prospective RCT comparing exercise with a
usual-care control group. Ethical approval was granted
from the University Human Research Ethics Committee
and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
Men were eligible for this study if they had histologically documented prostate cancer, had received ADT for
at least 2 months, did not have prostate-specific antigen
evidence of disease activity, and were anticipated to
remain hypogonadal for the subsequent 6 months. Exclusion criteria included bone metastatic disease; musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological disorders that
could inhibit them from exercising; inability to walk 400
meters or undertake upper and lower limb exercise; and

Study outcomes were assessed at baseline before randomization and after intervention (after 12 weeks). Detailed
descriptions of the assessments are described elsewhere.13
The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form
Health Survey (SF-36) was used to assess HRQoL in 8
domains: physical functioning, social functioning, role
limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due
to emotional problems, pain, mental health, vitality, and
general health.22-24 All raw scores were linearly converted
to a scale of 0 to 100 providing sum scores for each domain. In addition, scores were summarized in a physical
health composite score and a mental health composite
score.22-24 Higher scores represent better HRQoL. In the
current study, we focused on self-reported physical health
and general health, as operationalized with the physical
health composite score and the general health subscale.
One participant dropped out after baseline testing and
randomization and did not return the SF-36
questionnaire.
Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue subscale of
the European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC
QLQ-C30).10 A higher score indicates a higher level of

fatigue. Fatigue data for 7 participants were lacking
because this questionnaire was included in the assessment
battery after these participants entered the study.13
Lean mass of the upper and lower limbs was assessed
by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Upper and lower
body muscle strength were determined by the chest press
and leg press exercises, respectively, using the maximal
weight lifted at 1 time (1- repetition maximum). Walking
speed was assessed by the duration of a 6-meter usual walk
measured using electronic timing gates. Aerobic capacity
was assessed by timing a 400-meter walk.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation
and is associated with cardiovascular disease and possible cancer risk and that can respond to exercise. CRP was measured
commercially by an accredited Australian National Association of Testing Authorities laboratory (PathWest Laboratory
Medicine WA, Perth, Western Australia) from fasting blood
samples obtained early in the morning.
Statistical Analysis

Mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate whether
upper and lower body muscle strength, walking speed,
aerobic capacity, and fatigue mediated the intervention
effects on general and physical health. We also examined
whether upper and lower body muscle strength, walking
speed, aerobic capacity, and CRP mediated the intervention effects on fatigue. Finally, we explored whether intervention effects on muscle strength and walking speed were
mediated by lean body mass.
We calculated residual change scores of the independent, dependent, and mediator variables by regressing
the posttest values onto their pretest values. Residual
change scores represent the amount of change in the variables independent of the pretest values.
A series of linear regression analyses were conducted
on the residual change scores according to the product of
coefficients method described by MacKinnon (Fig. 1).25
First, we calculated the total effect of the intervention on
296

the outcome variable (total effect; path c). Second, we calculated the intervention effect on the potential mediator
variable (path a). Third, we calculated the association
between the potential mediator and the outcome variable
controlled for the intervention variable (path b). The third
regression model provides estimates for the b values and
for the direct association (path c0 ). The product of coefficients (a 3 b) provides an estimate of the relative strength
of the mediation effect. The percentage mediated is estimated by dividing the mediation effect (a 3 b) by the total
effect (path c). Subsequently, a bootstrapping method
(with 5000 bootstrap resamples) was used to calculate the
bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
around the mediated and direct effects using the SPSS statistical procedure suggested by Preacher and Hayes.26 In
the event >1 variable significantly mediated the intervention effect on the outcome, we conducted multiple mediation analyses to identify the strongest mediator. All
analyses were adjusted for ADT time, use of antiandrogens, number of medications, and education. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 20
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Alpha levels of P  .05
were considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences noted between groups at baseline.
Preintervention and postintervention results on muscle
strength, walking speed, aerobic capacity, fatigue, CRP,
and self-reported physical and general health are presented in Table 2.

significantly improved physical (c 5 5.03; 95% CI, 1.019.04) and general health (c 5 12.89; 95% CI, 2.2423.54) and reduced fatigue (c 5 210.08; 95% CI,
218.33 to 21.82) (Table 3).
Intervention Effect on the Mediator (Path a)

The intervention improved both upper (a 5 2.80; 95%
CI, 0.53-5.07) and lower (a 5 30.13; 95% CI, 19.63 to
40.64) body muscle strength, walking speed (a 5 20.30;
95% CI, 20.57 to 20.03), and fatigue (a 5 210.08;
95% CI, 218.33 to 21.82). In addition, the intervention
significantly reduced CRP (a 5 22.34; 95% CI, 23.97
to 20.71) compared with the usual-care control group
(Table 3).
Effect of the Mediator on the Outcome Variable
(Path b)

Upper body muscle strength (b 5 0.62; 95% CI, 0.16 to

20.68) were found to be significantly associated with
physical health, whereas no significant associations were
found for lower body muscle strength, aerobic capacity,
and fatigue (Table 3).
Increased walking speed (b 5 210.10; 95% CI,
220.77 to 0.56 [P 5 .07]) and fatigue (b 5 20.50;
95% CI, 20.89 to 20.11) were associated with
higher general health in both the single and multiple
mediation models (Table 3). Upper and lower body
muscle strength, walking speed, aerobic capacity, and
CRP were not found to be significantly associated
with fatigue (Table 3).

Mediation (a 3 b) and Direct Effects (Path c0 )

Finally, the mediation effects (a 3 b) and direct effects
(path c0 ) were examined. Single mediation analyses demonstrated that upper body muscle strength (a 3 b 5 1.74;
95% CI, 0.26 to 4.72) and walking speed (a 3 b 5 1.37;
95% CI, 0.14 to 3.85) significantly mediated the intervention effect on physical health, accounting for 35% and
27%, respectively, of the total effects. In the multiple
mediation model, the mediation effect of upper body
muscle strength and walking speed was 2.65 (95% CI,
0.64 to 5.54), accounting for 53% of the total intervention effect on physical health (Table 3) (Fig. 2).
Single mediation analyses indicated that fatigue
(a 3 b 5 4.55; 95% CI, 1.12 to 12.51) mediated the
intervention effect on general health, accounting for 31%
of the total intervention effect. We found a trend regarding the mediating effect of walking speed (a 3 b 5 3.40;
95% CI, 20.21 to 8.33 [percentage mediated, 26%]).
The multiple mediation model demonstrated that the
mediation effect of walking speed and fatigue was 7.52
(95% CI, 2.16 to 16.92), accounting for 51% of the total
intervention effect on general health (Table 3) (Fig. 3).
The intervention effects on fatigue were not significantly
mediated by upper and lower body strength, walking
speed, aerobic capacity, and CRP.

explained by improvements in upper limb lean mass, and
whether intervention effects on lower body muscle
strength and walking speed could be explained by
improvements in lower limb lean mass. Compared with
usual care, the intervention resulted in significant
improvements in upper (a 5 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.41)
and lower (a 5 0.51; 95% CI, 0.08-0.95) limb lean mass.
Increased lean mass of the lower limb was associated with
increased walking speed (b of 20.18; 95% CI, 20.34 to
20.02), but no significant associations were found for
lower body muscle strength. The mediation analyses demonstrated that upper limb lean mass significantly mediated the intervention effect on upper body muscle
strength (a 3 b 5 1.04; 95% CI, 0.01-2.48), accounting
for 37% of the total effect. Lower limb lean mass did not
significantly mediate the intervention effect on lower
body muscle strength or walking speed.
DISCUSSION
The results of the current study provide insight into the
mechanisms underlying the effects of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program on physical and general
health in men receiving ADT for prostate cancer. These
findings indicate that exercise effects on different HRQoL
outcomes can be explained by different mechanisms, such
that improvements in physical health could be explained
by improved upper body muscle strength and walking
speed, whereas improvements in walking speed and
reductions in fatigue explained the intervention effects on
general health.
Although the intervention significantly improved
lower body muscle strength, we found, in contrast to our
expectations, no mediating effects of lower body muscle
strength on physical health. Several explanations may be
possible to explain the lack of these mediation effects.
First, for older individuals, the lower body is used extenCancer

sively in tasks of daily living, such as climbing stairs and
rising from a chair. This may be sufficient to preserve
muscle mass and strength of the lower body and therefore
although the intervention produced significant improvements in muscle strength, the deficit at the start may not
have been large enough for a noticeable impact on physical function or physical health. Conversely, the upper
body is not used as much by older individuals and therefore muscle mass and strength are relatively lower. This is
also in keeping with the finding that the intervention
effect on upper body muscle strength was mediated by
improved lean mass of the upper limb, whereas the effect
on lower body muscle strength could not be explained by
improvements in lean mass of the lower limbs. Therefore,
nonhypertrophic adaptations are more likely to be responsible for improvements in lower body muscle strength.
Clearly, this population benefits considerably from upper
body resistance exercise. Second, the lack of an association
between lower body muscle strength and aerobic capacity
with physical health may be related to the questionnaire
that was used to assess physical health. This questionnaire
mainly concerns the ability to carry heavy bags and the
ability to walk certain distances. Therefore, it may be less
sensitive for the detection of changes in function as a consequence of improved lower body muscle strength or aerobic capacity, compared with upper body muscle strength
and walking speed.
Furthermore, the intervention also resulted in
improved aerobic capacity compared with the control
group, but this could not explain improvements in physical health. Apparently, for improving physical and general
health in this population, improvements in muscle
strength and walking speed may be more important than
improvements in aerobic capacity. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because a submaximal 400-meter walk test was used to assess aerobic

capacity instead of a more rigorous maximum exercise
stress test with expired gas analysis.
Upper body muscle strength appeared to be less important for general health. The mediation effect of fatigue
on general health is in keeping with previous findings of a
mediating role of fatigue in the effect of exercise on
HRQoL among cancer survivors.19,20,27 The results of the
current study demonstrated that reducing fatigue is important for improving the perceived general health of
patients, but is less likely to affect physical health. Similar
to physical health, walking speed also mediated the intervention effect on general health, emphasizing the importance of improving; functional performance such as
walking speed in this patient population.
Furthermore, the results of the current study demonstrated that a resistance and aerobic exercise intervention significantly reduced fatigue in patients undergoing
ADT for prostate cancer. However, intervention effects
on fatigue could not be explained by improved muscle
strength, aerobic capacity, or walking speed, nor by
reduced inflammation. In contrast, in patients with other
types of cancer, improvements in peak power output,
functional ability, or energy expenditure were associated
with reduced fatigue.19,20 Our lack of a significant association may be related to low baseline values of fatigue in
the intervention group leaving less room for improvement. Conversely, fatigue also may be influenced by psychosocial factors, including depression, anxiety, coping
style, pain, and sleep disturbances,28,29 which can also be
improved by exercise.30,31 In the current study, we were
not able to explore the mediating role of psychosocial factors in the exercise-induced reductions in fatigue, and
therefore it should be explored in future studies.
Strengths and Limitations of the
Current Study

The current study addressed the working mechanisms of
a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program in a
well-conducted RCT. However, several limitations
should be noted. First, the sample size was relatively
small, as evidenced by the large 95% CIs. This allowed
us to explore potential mediators, but future studies with
larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm underlying
working mechanisms. Second, we used a submaximal
400-meter walk test to assess aerobic capacity, which
may have been less sensitive to detect changes. However,
this is a well-accepted measure of aerobic capacity in
older adults and correlates well with direct measures of
aerobic capacity.32,33 Third, the chest press and leg press
exercises that were used in the resistance exercise training
300

were also used to assess muscle strength of the upper and
lower body. This may have resulted in learning effects in
the intervention group, and consequently an overestimation of the intervention effect on muscle strength.
Fourth, we did not include an attention control group.
Although it is unlikely that this influenced the effects on
physical health, increased attention or support may have
contributed to improved general health perceptions in
the exercise group. Finally, the baseline levels of fatigue
were lower in the intervention group compared with the
control group. Therefore, it may have been more difficult to demonstrate improvements in fatigue after exercise and, consequently, resulted in an underestimation of
the finding on fatigue.
Despite these limitations, the results of the current
study demonstrated that a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program resulted in improved physical and
general health and in reduced fatigue in patients undergoing ADT for prostate cancer. We showed that the
effects on the different outcomes of an exercise program
could be explained by different mediators. This information is useful for designing more personalized exercise
intervention programs tailored to the desired outcomes of
individual patients. Because the beneficial effects on physical health can be explained by intervention-induced
improvements in upper body muscle strength and walking
speed, it appears to be advisable to include upper body resistance training and exercises to improve walking speed
in exercise interventions aimed at improving the physical
health of patients with prostate cancer. Improvements in
general health may be accomplished by improving walking speed and reducing fatigue. These findings confirm
the beneficial effects of combined resistance and aerobic
exercise training for men receiving ADT for prostate cancer. Future studies examining mediators of exercise interventions should include larger sample sizes; examine other
potential mediators such as social support, self-efficacy, or
distress;21,27 and include long-term follow-up.
