Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy that resists current treatments. To test
epigenetic therapy against this cancer, we used the DNA demethylating drug 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (DAC) in an
aggressive mouse model of stromal rich PDAC (KPC-Brca1 mice). In untreated tumors, we found globally
decreased 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) in malignant epithelial cells and in cancer-associated myoﬁbroblasts (CAF),
along with increased amounts of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-HmC) in CAFs, in progression from pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia to PDAC. DAC further reduced DNA methylation and slowed PDAC progression,
markedly extending survival in an early-treatment protocol and signiﬁcantly though transiently inhibiting tumor
growth when initiated later, without adverse side effects. Escaping tumors contained areas of sarcomatoid
transformation with disappearance of CAFs. Mixing-allografting experiments and proliferation indices showed
that DAC efﬁcacy was due to inhibition of both the malignant epithelial cells and the CAFs. Expression proﬁling
and immunohistochemistry highlighted DAC induction of STAT1 in the tumors, and DAC plus IFN-g produced
an additive antiproliferative effect on PDAC cells. DAC induced strong expression of the testis antigen deleted
in azoospermia-like (DAZL) in CAFs. These data show that DAC is effective against PDAC in vivo and provide a
rationale for future studies combining hypomethylating agents with cytokines and immunotherapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating cancer for which current chemotherapy offers only
modest improvements in survival. Surgical resection of local
tumors can prolong survival, but more than 70% of patients
present with advanced disease, lowering the predicted overall survival to just 4- to 5 months. As a result, PDAC is the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Europe
and North America. PDACs are among the most highly
desmoplastic tumors known: typically, neoplastic epithelial
cells comprise only a small fraction of the tumor mass,
suggesting that the stromal cells play a signiﬁcant role in

the biology of these tumors. In line with this idea, experimental data in various tumor systems have consistently
shown that cancer-associated myoﬁbroblasts (CAF) and
other stroma cells actively promote tumor growth and
progression (1–8). Indeed, multiple lines of evidence are
starting to suggest that targeting CAFs may be an effective
approach to treat cancer (9, 10). For example, one of us (K.
Olive) recently used an inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway to
target the stromal cells of pancreatic tumors in genetically
engineered mice, resulting in substantial albeit transient
responses in most tumors when combined with the cytotoxic nucleoside analog gemcitabine (9). More recently, an
enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid, a key component of
the extracellular matrix, was used to treat PDAC-bearing
mice, resulting in depletion of CAFs and a signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt when combined with gemcitabine (11, 12).
Drugs that target global DNA methylation are another
new and promising approach against solid tumors. Hypomethylating agents such as 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (decitabine; DAC) are already used in low-dose regimens to prolong
survival in patients with myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS; refs. 13, 14), and are now being
studied in similar low-dose protocols for their effects against
solid tumors (15). In principle, hypomethylating agents
could exert antitumor effects not only on the neoplastic
cell population, but also by killing or growth-arresting
cancer-associated stromal cells. In this regard, we previously
reported consistent ﬁndings of reduced global DNA

methylation and focally increased gene-speciﬁc methylation
in CAFs from gastric carcinomas (16). These observations
suggest a therapeutic opportunity to concurrently target
malignant epithelial cells and their supportive CAFs using
hypomethylating drugs, to achieve a net antiproliferative
effect from activation of growth suppressor genes and
induction of a genome-wide hypomethylation crisis in the
tumor cells, which already have hypomethylated genomes at
baseline (10). Here, we test these ideas by using low-dose
single-agent DAC in a rapid onset stroma-rich mouse model
of PDAC.

Materials and Methods
Genetically modiﬁed mice
All mice used in this study were housed in an Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
(AAALAC)-accredited facility and all procedures relating to the
care and use of animals were conducted at Columbia University
(New York) in accordance with the NIH guidelines. The Brca1ﬂex2
and p53ﬂex7 mice have been previously described (17, 18). The
mouse strains p53LSL-R270H (strain number 01XM3), KrasLSL-G12D
(strain number 01XJ6), and Pdx1-cre (strain number 01XL5)
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Frederick Mouse Repository. All mice generated in this study were
maintained on a mixed 129/B6 genetic background.
DAC administration to mice
Intraperitoneal injection of DAC (Sigma-Aldrich) was conducted once weekly according to the treatment schedules
outlined. A total of 5 mg/mL dilutions were made in PBS fresh
every day of treatment. Hamilton syringes were used to inject
the mice with DAC [100 mL; dose of DAC 1 mg/g of body weight,
similar to prior studies in other mouse models of cancer (19,
20)] after weighing them on each day of treatment. An equal
volume of PBS was injected in the control animals. Mice were
sacriﬁced using isoﬂurane inhalation and cervical disclocation.
At necropsy the entire pancreas was removed and weighed.
Tissue was ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde or snap-frozen for further
analysis.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
For detecting nuclear 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC), we used a
mouse monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Calbiochem), with a protocol that has been previously validated by our group (16). An
identical protocol was followed for staining or costaining with
a polyclonal anti-5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-HmC) antibody
(Cat # 39769, ActiveMotif). Standard IHC and immunoﬂuorescence staining protocols were used for detecting alpha-smooth
muscle actin (ASMA; ab5694, Abcam), p53 [Novocastra, rabbit
polyclonal antibody (CM5), Cat# NCL-p53-CM5p], STAT1
(ab31639, Abcam), STAT2 (ab53132, Abcam), Ki67 (M7248,
Dako), and deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL; ab34139,
Abcam). For dual staining of 5-mC and ASMA or 5-mC and
5-HmC the above procedure was followed for the anti-mC
staining and subsequently slides were incubated with the antiASMA or anti-5-HmC antibody and developed. The intensity of
nuclear staining was measured using Image-J software (Image J
v 1.38) after outlining the nuclear area of epithelial or stromal

cells based on morphology, location, and ASMA or vimentin
positivity. The Ki67 index was calculated on the basis of 7 DAC
and PBS treated stage- or age-matched cases and expressed as
percentage of cells per high-power ﬁeld averaged over 10 ﬁelds
in each case.
Cytosine acceptor assay for DNA methylation
A ﬂuorometric assay that relies on differential cytosine
incorporation after digestion with the methylation-sensitive
HpaII restriction enzyme (Epigentek) was used to measure the
percentage of methylated cytosines in all genomic HpaII
restriction sites. Results were normalized on the basis of a
calibration curve of mixtures of fully methylated and unmethylated DNA.
Methylation-sensitive bisulﬁte sequencing and cloning
Genomic DNA was bisulﬁte-converted using the Epitech
Bisulﬁte Kit (Qiagen, S9104), followed by PCR with the following primer pairs designed using MethPrimer (21): STAT1
amplicon A, forward: AGAGGTAGAAATAGGAGTTAGATTAAT, reverse: AACAAAACCTCTTTACTTCTTCCTTTC; amplicon
B, forward: AATTTTGTAAATATAATTTTTTGTTTG, reverse:
ATCTCCAAAAAACTTTAACAAACTC; amplicon C, forward:
ACATTTATTTGGGATATTGTTGAG, reverse: ATCATTTTACCCTAAAAATAAAAAC. The PCR cycling conditions were an
initial denaturation at 94 C for 1 minute, followed by 35 cycles
with denaturation for 30 seconds and extensions for 1 minute
at 72 C, with annealing temperatures starting at 60 C and
touching down 1 in each cycle until a plateau at 51 C. The PCR
products were cloned in Escherichia coli (TOPO-TA Cloning
Kit, Life Sciences) and multiple clones derived from each
original genomic sample were sequenced to determine the
pattern of methylated and unmethylated cytosines.
Gene expression proﬁling
Total RNA from cultured pancreatic cancer cells and CAFs
was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Microarray
analysis for mRNA expression was conducted using the
MouseWG-6 v2 Bead Chip Expression arrays (Illumina).
Each array contained more than 45,000 probes based on
RefSeq release 22, supplemented with MEEBO and RIKEN
FANTOM2 content. Normalized expression data were analyzed in dChip (22) by ANOVA and supervised hierarchical
clustering after ﬁrst applying a minimum 1.5-fold change
criterion. The probe-level data have been deposited at
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession GSE42364 and
GSE42365). Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted
using Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software (www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea).
Isolation of primary cells and pretreatment
mixing-allografting experiments
We derived primary PDAC cells from the KPC-Brca1 mouse
tumors. From animals at an advanced stage of disease, a small
piece of mouse pancreatic tumor tissue was dissected away
from normal pancreatic parenchyma, then minced, trypsinized, and passed through 18- and 21-gauge needles to

dissociate the cells. The tumor tissue was cultured on gelatinized plates in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with pencillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% FBS
for 1 to 2 weeks until the tumor cell lines were established.
Primary CAFs were isolated from pancreata of 3.5-week-old
KPC-Brca1 mice, which displayed advanced pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and microinvasive tumors only, to
minimize the possibility of contamination with tumor cells.
Brieﬂy, half of each pancreas was minced, whereas the other
half was ﬁxed in 10% buffered-formalin for histology. Minced
pancreata were trypsinized and passed through 18 G and 21 G
needles to further disssociate the tissue, followed by plating in
RPMI media supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin,
L-glutamine and 10% FBS. Cultures were maintained undisturbed for over a week until the CAFs had migrated out of the
tissue. The purity of the CAF and PDAC epithelial cell preparations was determined morphologically and by antigen
expression: the short-term CAF culture was veriﬁed as mostly
consisting of ASMA- and vimentin-positive cells (>90%),
whereas the PDAC cell culture contained less than 10% ASMAand vimentin-positive cells and more than 80% CK-19–positive
cells by immunoﬂuorescence. To prevent clonal selection of
CAFs, primary cultures were passaged not more than once or
twice before being used for allograft experiments. Tumor cells
or myoﬁbroblasts (CAFs) were pretreated for 24 hours (epithelial tumor cells) or 48 hours (myoﬁbroblasts; slower dividing) with DAC (0.25 mmol/L for the tumor cells and 2 mmol/L
for the CAFs) in cell culture dishes, followed by 24 hours
recovery. Six- to 8-week-old immunocompromised mice
[severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID), Jackson Laboratories) were used for subcutaneous injection of DAC exposed
or unexposed control pancreatic tumor cells (2.5  105) with
and without a mixture of DAC exposed or unexposed control
primary pancreatic myoﬁbroblasts (CAFs; 5  104). Tumor
cells or myoﬁbroblasts were pretreated for 24 hours (epithelial
cells) or 48 hours (myoﬁbroblasts; slower dividing) with DAC (1
mmol/L) in cell culture dishes, followed by 1 day without the
drug. Cell mixtures were then injected into both ﬂanks of each
recipient mouse. Tumor size was monitored every 3 days for 4
weeks. Tumors were dissected at 4 weeks and tumor diameters
were measured.
Testing DAC plus IFN-g as a drug combination in PDAC
cells
Two of the primary PDAC cell lines were used for the IFN-g
experiments with or without concomitant DAC exposure. In
gelatin-coated 96-well plates, tumor cells were seeded at a
density of 1,000 cells per well; 48 hours postseeding of cells,
treatment was begun; cells were either left untreated, or
treated with the following; mouse IFN-g (100 ng/mL) only, or
mouse IFN-g (100 ng/mL) with DAC, or DAC only. IFN-g
treatment was done for 4 days; whenever DAC was included
in the treatment, it was applied at a concentration of 0.5 mmol/
L for the ﬁrst 24 hours followed by 0.05 mmol/L concentration
for additional 24 hours, then removed. At the end of the
treatment period, cells were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL)
for 4 hours followed by solubilization in HCl/SDS-containing
lysis buffer. Colorimetric measurements indicating relative

numbers of viable cells were taken on a microplate reader
(BioTek Instruments).

Results
The KrasLSL-G12D; p53LSL-R270H/þ; Pdx1-cre; Brca1ﬂex2/ﬂex2;
(KPC-Brca1) mouse model produces a rapid onset
stroma-rich form of PDAC
Mice carrying conditional oncogenic alleles of K-ras
(KrasLSL-G12D; abbreviated Kras ) and the p53 tumor suppressor
gene (p53LSL-R270H or p53ﬂex7; abbreviated p53 ), both driven by
a pancreatic epithelial cell-speciﬁc Pdx1-Cre recombinase,
have provided one of the most useful experimental models of
PDAC (9, 23, 24). However, while the tumor penetrance is high
in these mice, the tumor latency is long [Fig. 1A; T50 ¼ 150 days
in our mouse colony; consistent with published data from
Hingorani and Tuveson (25, 26)]. To generate a faster model for
drug treatment studies, we added to this model a conditional
allele of the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene (abbreviated Brca1ﬂex2
). Adding the Brca1ﬂex2 allele is biologically reasonable, as
BRCA1 is known to be downmodulated through nonmutational pathways in human PDAC, and individuals with some
types of BRCA1 germline mutations are at increased risk for
PDAC (27–31). As shown by the survival curves in Fig. 1A, PDAC
formation in the resulting triple genetically modiﬁed KPCBrca1 (KrasLSL-G12D/þ; p53LSL-R270H/þ; Pdx1-cre; Brca1ﬂex2/ﬂex2)
mice is signiﬁcantly accelerated (T50 ¼ 88 days with the
p53R270H point-mutant allele and T50 ¼ 84 days with the
conditional p53ﬂex7 null allele). Development of pancreatic
tumors in these mice hinges on stochastic loss of the remaining
wild-type allele of p53, accelerated by genomic instability from
the Brca1-deﬁciency, so the tumors are oligo-clonal. At sacriﬁce, the tumors encompass the entire pancreas, animals
accumulate ascites and they frequently show metastasis to
distant organs including liver, lung, and diaphragm, similar to
the metastatic lesions in Kras ; p53R172H/þ; Pdx1-cre; (KPC)
animals (25), but with faster onset.
These tumors show many features of the histopathology of
human PDAC, including a step-wise progression from PanIN
precursor lesions of increasing dysplasia to invasive adenocarcinoma with malignant glands surrounded by abundant
stromal myoﬁbroblasts (Fig. 1B–E). Stabilized mutant p53R270H
protein is already easily detectable by IHC in epithelial cell
nuclei in early to mid-stage PanIN lesions (Fig. 1B) and, as
expected, is absent from the nonneoplastic stromal myoﬁbroblasts, which proliferate to form cellular cuffs around every
PanIN lesion (Fig. 1B–D). An additional histopathology in the
KPC-Brca1 mice, which is not prominent in the original KPC
model, is the occurence of pancreatic cysts of various sizes, all
lined by epithelial cells that are malignant by cytology and by
the criterion of mutant p53 expression. This feature overlaps
with the broader spectrum of human pancreatic histopathology, as cystic growth patterns can be seen in a subgroup of
human pancreatic neoplasms with K-ras mutations (32–34).
On the basis of histologic examination in mice necropsied over
a range of time points, the invasive PDACs seem to evolve from
PanIN lesions in small ductules, similar to the KPC model,
whereas the cystic lesions seem to arise from dysplastic
proliferative lesions in the larger pancreatic ducts.

Global 5-mC content decreases in malignant epithelial
cells and stromal myoﬁbroblasts early in tumor
progression
The normal pancreas contains only rare ASMA-positive
myoﬁbroblasts, which are thought to derive from pancreatic
stellate cells. In early PanIN lesions and all later stages, these
cells express both ASMA and a general mesenchyme marker,
the intermediate ﬁlament vimentin. Using IHC and immunoﬂuorescence with a widely used monoclonal antibody against
5-mC, we found a decrease in nuclear 5-mC content both in the
stromal and malignant epithelial compartments during the
progression from early PanIN to late PanIN and invasive cancer
(Fig. 2A–C; quantitation by image analysis in Supplementary
Fig. S1). We previously showed in another type of cancer,
gastric adenocarcinoma, that there are differences in 5-mC
content and amount of immunoreactive DNMT1 methyltransferase in CAFs compared with malignant epithelial cells
(16, 29). Similar to those data, the intensity of nuclear and
cytoplasmic DNMT1 staining of epithelial cells versus CAFs in
the mouse PDACs was very distinct, with less DNMT1, nearly
undetectable at the level of sensitivity of IHC, in the ﬁbroblastic
stromal cells (Fig. 2D). These observations by IHC are striking
both in the mouse model and in human PDAC (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). DNMT1 expression is known to be highest in
proliferating cells, and a difference in proliferation may
explain, at least in part, the lower expression of DNMT1 in
CAFs. This explanation is supported by our Western blot
analysis comparing DNMT1 protein levels in normal human
ﬁbroblast lines grown in varying concentrations of serum
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), and further supported by our analysis of proliferation indices in CAFs versus malignant epithelial
cells in the KPC-Brca1 tumors (see later).

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

As the BRCA1 protein can interact with DNMT1 (35), we
further asked whether our ﬁndings of reduced global DNA
methylation in the early to late PanIN transition would generalize to the other transgenic models of pancreatic cancer, in
which the Brca1 gene is not modiﬁed (i.e., Kras/Ink4aArf). IHC
on sections of PanIN and PDAC from this slower onset cancer
model showed a similar progressive reduction in 5-mC (data
not shown), indicating that the phenomenon is characteristic
of Kras-driven PDAC.
CAFs accumulate 5-HmC early in tumor progression
Given recent results suggesting that the modiﬁed base 5HmC is a precursor to active or passive DNA demethylation in
vivo, we used triple-color immonoﬂuorescence to assess
the relative nuclear content of 5-mC and 5-HmC in epithelial
and stromal cells during PanIN progression, with ASMA or
vimentin visualized as cytoplasmic markers for stromal myoﬁbroblasts/CAFs. As noted earlier, at the early PanIN stage
ASMA-positive myoﬁbroblasts begin to proliferate, forming
well-deﬁned cellular cuffs around PanIN lesions. Triple immunoﬂuorescence revealed that a majority of the rare vimentinand ASMA-positive stromal cells in the nonneoplastic pancreatic parenchyma, and many of these cells in the earliest
PanIN lesions, have strong 5-mC staining with low levels of
5-HmC, whereas with progression from early to late PanIN, we
observed a strong and uniform accumulation of nuclear
5-HmC in the CAFs (Fig. 2A–C and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Together with our previous ﬁndings in human and mouse
gastric cancers, these new results in PanIN and PDAC show
that CAFs differ from normal resident myoﬁbroblasts in terms
of their global genomic 5-mC and, as shown here, 5-HmC, and
are also strikingly epigenetically distinct from malignant

DAC Therapy in PDAC

Figure 2. Stage-speciﬁc and cell type–speciﬁc levels of genomic
5-mC and 5-HmC and DNMT1 in stromal and epithelial cells during
tumor progression. A, the section of early PanIN and adjacent
histologically normal pancreatic parenchyma was subjected to triple
immunoﬂuorescence with antibodies recognizing vimentin (blue), 5-mC
(green), and 5-HmC (red). Most of the proliferating epithelial cells in the
early PanIN lesion (asterisk) stain strongly for 5-mC and only weakly for 5HmC. The 5-mC signal is partly punctate in mouse cell nuclei, presumably
reﬂecting concentrations of heterochromatin, whereas the 5-HmC signal
is more diffuse. The reactive stromal myoﬁbroblasts (arrows) are primarily
staining for 5-mC but are starting to accumulate 5-HmC. B, late PanIN
lesion in which the majority of vimentin-positive CAFs (arrows) show
a stronger immunoﬂuorescence signal for 5-HmC than for 5-mC. There
is a moderate reduction in the average 5-mC immunoﬂuorescence
signal in the proliferating dysplastic epithelial cells of the PanIN lesions
(asterisk) but, contrasting with the stromal cells, this is not accompanied
by a strong increase in 5-HmC. C, in PDAC there is reduced 5-mC
signal intensity in the malignant epithelial cells (quantitative immunoﬂuorescence measurements in Supplementary Fig. S1), with only a weak
accumulation of 5-HmC, whereas the proliferating CAFs show even less
staining for 5-mC, contrasting with a very strong signal for 5-HmC. D, IHC

epithelial cells in the relative global content of these 2 important
marks. As noted earlier, the DNMT1 methyltransferase was
detected by IHC at higher levels in the epithelial cells of the
PDAC tumors, both in the mouse model and in human PDACs.
DNMT1 expression is known to be proliferation-dependent, and
this difference in expression is at least in part accounted for by
slower proliferation of the CAFs (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig.
S3). From a therapeutic standpoint, the relatively low baseline
levels of 5-mC in genomic DNA of both CAFs and malignant
epithelial cells might contribute to a good therapeutic index for
hypomethylating drugs, with less adverse effects on normal
cells, whose genomes are more replete with 5-mC.
Low doses of DAC signiﬁcantly inhibit tumor PDAC
tumor progression with minimal side effects
We next tested the effects of single-agent DAC in the
PDAC model, starting treatment of the mice either at an
early time point when PanIN was established and micro-

invasive lesions were beginning to form, without overt tumor
formation, or later after tumor formation (Table 1). We ﬁrst
carried out an early intervention study with low-dose DAC or
PBS control intraperitoneal injections starting at 3 weeks of
age, with necropsies conducted at a single time point after 5
weeks of treatment. We then repeated the same protocol as a
survival experiment, carrying out necropsies on the mice
only after they developed large tumors and preterminal
morbidity.
In our initial pilot experiment, starting at 3 weeks of age and
following 5 intraperitoneal injections of DAC (1 mg/g of body
weight) or PBS once per week the animals were sacriﬁced for
necropsies. Analysis of the treated KPC-Brca1 mice showed
that DAC markedly reduced the PDAC tumor burden (Fig. 3A
and B) and reduced the amount of invasive cancer compared
with littermate KPC-Brca1 mice injected with PBS. At this time
point, the majority of the animals in the PBS-treated control
group had large invasive tumors and concomitantly reduced
normal pancreas. In contrast, the DAC-treated animals had
much smaller tumor nodules, with abundant remaining normal pancreas and either absent or reduced tumor invasion
(Table 1).
In the early treatment to survival experiment, we treated
groups of mice starting at the same early time point (3 weeks of
age) using the same dose and schedule of intraperitoneal DAC
versus PBS vehicle control. The results from measurements of
global 5-mC in tumors at necropsy indicated a signiﬁcant
pharmocodynamic effect of the drug, with substantial reductions in genomic 5-mC in the DAC-treated versus sham-treated
tumors as well as in spleen DNA from the same animals (Fig. 3C
and data not shown), and there was a marked survival beneﬁt
for the mice, with a prolongation of the T50 from 87 to 128 days
(P < 0.0001; Table 1 and Fig. 3D). In a third experiment, we used
a later treatment paradigm, starting DAC at 8 weeks of age,
which may be more reﬂective of its potential use in advanced
human PDACs. In a group of mice sacriﬁced at day 0 of
treatment (n ¼ 6), all had invasive carcinomas. As shown
in Table 1 and Fig. 3D, even when started at this later time
the single-agent DAC therapy substantially prolonged survival,
increasing the T50 from 87 to 110 days (P < 0.0001). IHC for the
proliferation marker Ki67 revealed that the CAFs were proliferating in the untreated tumors, albeit at a slower rate than the
malignant epithelial cells, and that there was signiﬁcant suppression of proliferation of both cell types by DAC treatment
(Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S3). From these experiments,
we conclude that low-dose single-agent DAC has promising
anticancer activity in this mouse model of aggressive stromarich PDAC.
Importantly, no adverse effects on a group of 6 normal
control mice were noted with this dose regimen of DAC; we
found that the standard blood counts were not affected by this
treatment, with average hemoglobin (g/dL) 9.2 in DAC versus
9.0 in control (reference range, 11–15.1), and white blood cells
(WBC; 103/mL) 4.7 in DAC; 6.6 in control (reference range,
1.8–10.7). In addition, each of 2 male wild-type mice given this
drug regimen and then allowed to mate with wild-type females

injections were started at 3 weeks of age, with necropsies conducted at a single time point after 5 weeks of treatment. Pancreatic weight is mostly
accounted for by tumor mass (see B). B, gross photographs of representative pancreata from the pilot experiment. C, levels of 5-mC in genomic
DNA measured by the cytosine incorporation assay in tumors from the experiments in which mice were treated with DAC or PBS vehicle control for
6 to 7 weeks. D, Kaplan–Meier survival curves showing the highly signiﬁcant antitumor effects of DAC when started either at 3 weeks (all mice with PanIN
at the start of therapy; few with invasive lesions) or at 8 weeks of age (all mice with invasive PDAC at the start of therapy). E, reduction in proliferation
index (% Ki67-positive cells per high power ﬁeld in 10 ﬁelds in 7 cases) by DAC in both CAFs and malignant epithelial cells.

Mixing-allografting shows an additive antiproliferative
effect of DAC on malignant epithelial cells and CAFs in
reconstituted tumors
Because in vivo treatment in the KPC-Brca1 mouse model
cannot dissect whether the efﬁcacy of DAC in inhibiting
overall tumor growth is due to its effects on tumor cells or on
their supportive stromal cells or both, we next designed a
tumor reconstitution-allografting experiment to address this
issue. In this protocol, only pancreatic CAFs or only the
malignant epithelial cells were pretreated with DAC followed by mixing of the 2 types of cells and allografting in
immunodeﬁcient nude mice. We derived the primary PDAC
cell lines as well as the pancreatic CAFs from the KPC-Brca1
mouse model; the pancreatic CAFs were maintained in
culture for a short time (<1 week) to minimize clonal
selection and possible epigenetic changes induced by prolonged culture. In these short-term cultures, we found that
the epithelial cells were growth-inhibited within 2 days by
very low amounts of DAC (0.25 mmol/L), whereas the CAFs
were more resistant and continued to proliferate slowly in
culture for up to a week in the presence of 2 mmol/L DAC.
The CAFs, or separately the malignant epithelial cells, were
pretreated (or untreated for control cells) with these concentrations of DAC for a brief period of 24 hours in culture,

followed by continued cell culture for 1 day without drug,
and were then injected together (carcinoma cells:CAFs in a
10:1 ratio), or the carcinoma cells separately, subcutaneously
into the ﬂanks of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice. Following injection, we monitored the allograft tumors by external examination for 3
weeks, then sacriﬁced the animals and processed the tumors
for size measurements and histology. The results (Fig. 4A)
allowed several conclusions: (i) while the malignant epithelial cells by themselves can form tumors, adding CAFs has a
positive effect on tumor growth; (ii) pretreating the carcinoma cells alone with DAC signiﬁcantly reduces the growth
of the tumor allografts; and (iii) treating the CAFs well before
mixing them with the malignant epithelial cells leads to an
even greater net antitumor effect.
DAC upregulates IFN-inducible genes in PDAC cells and
IFN-g potentiates its antiproliferative effect
To begin to study the biologic mechanisms of DAC against
PDAC, and to gain insights that could lead to rational choices of
second agents to combine with DAC therapy, we conducted
microarray-based gene expression proﬁling on short-term
cultures of maligant epithelial cells and, separately, CAFs
isolated from the KPC-Brca1 mouse tumors, with or without

DAC exposure. When we queried these data for differentially
expressed genes a large set of known IFN-inducible genes,
including the STAT1 (>5-fold at the mRNA level in epithelial
and 2-fold in CAFs) and STAT2 (>2-fold increase of mRNA in
both epithelial and CAF cultures treated with DAC vs. PBS)
genes among others, were found to be upregulated by the DAC
treatment (Supplementary Table S1). GSEA conﬁrmed that IFN
response and other cytokine signaling–induced genes were
statistically over-represented in the DAC-induced transcripts
(Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S2). Because
we postulated that the difference in their expression was due to
altered CpG methylation, we conducted bisulﬁte sequencing of
the extended STAT1 promoter region, which revealed demethylation of an upstream region in DAC-treated primary cultures

of the PDAC epithelial cells, as well as in whole tumors treated
in vivo (Fig. 4B). We have not studied histone modiﬁcations in
tumor cells from the KPC-Brca1 mice, but alignment of our
bisulﬁte amplicons with ENCODE data (31) from a normal
endodermal tissue (mouse fetal liver) suggests that the DACresponsive region is marked by a block of histone modiﬁcation
(H3K4m1) that may be able to act in a regulatory fashion by
being the ﬁrst step in formation of the fully repressive H3K4m3
mark.
Importantly, analysis of tissue sections by IHC conﬁrmed
that this transcriptional upregulation led to markedly
increased expression of STAT1 at the protein level, and a
modest increase in STAT2, in the malignant epithelial cells
of the PDAC tumors that had been treated with DAC in vivo

Figure 4. Tumor reconstitution-allografting experiment and reduced promoter CpG methylation of the STAT1 gene in PDAC cells after DAC treatment. A, shortterm cultures of pancreatic CAFs or PDAC epithelial cells from the KPC-Brca1 tumors were pretreated with DAC or grown without the drug, followed by mixing
of the 2 types of cells and allografting into the ﬂanks of nude mice. Mice were sacriﬁced after 3 weeks and the tumor diameters were measured. As
indicated by comparing condition A to condition B, the presence of CAFs promotes tumor growth. As indicated by comparing condition B to condition
C, pretreating the carcinoma cells alone signiﬁcantly reduces the growth of the tumor allografts. As indicated by comparing condition D to condition
E, treating the CAFs as well before mixing them with the malignant epithelial cells leads to the greatest net antitumor effect. B, bisulﬁte sequencing of genomic
DNA from PDAC tumor cells exposed to 0 or 0.5 mmol/L DAC in short-term culture, and whole PDAC tumors from mice receiving PBS vehicle control
or DAC shows partial demethylation of a potential regulatory region overlapping a block of histone H3K4m1 chromatin modiﬁcation (from ENCODE/LICR
fetal liver ChIP-Seq data) extending from approximately 0.6 to 1 kb upstream of the STAT1 ﬁrst exon. The bar graph summarizes the bisulﬁte
sequencing data (% methylated CpG's in amplicon a) for the indicated number of in vivo–treated tumors analyzed. Bisulﬁte sequencing of the 2 amplicons
(b and c) overlapping the STAT1 CpG island (light grey) showed nearly complete lack of CpG methylation in both DAC-treated and untreated tumor
samples (data not shown).

(Fig. 5A). We also addressed whether DAC activates genes at
both the mRNA and protein level in the CAFs in vivo. From our
expression proﬁling data, we selected those genes that showed
signiﬁcant upregulation following DAC treatment in CAFs and
had suitable antibody reagents available for IHC and/or immunoﬂuorescence. DAZL is one of the top such genes and IHC and
immunoﬂuorescence for DAZL protein expression in fact
showed a marked increase in DAC-treated tumors in the CAFs
(Fig. 5B).
Finally, on the basi of these results of gene expression
proﬁling, IHC, and bisulﬁte sequencing, we postulated that
DAC-treatment might sensitize PDAC cells to antiproliferative
cytokine signaling, including signaling by IFNs (36–38). To
test for additive or synergistic interactions between DAC and
IFN-g, we conducted proliferation assays following DAC, IFN-g,
or the combination of both agents, in short-term cultures of
PDAC cells from the KPC-Brca1 mice. These experiments
showed an additive antiproliferative effect of IFN-g plus DAC
(Fig. 6).

PDAC tumors that escape from DAC treatment have
reduced stroma and sarcomatoid transformation of
malignant epithelial cells
We next examined the effects of DAC treatment on the
histopathology of the PDAC tumors that ultimately escaped
from inhibition by the drug and progressed to kill the mice. For
this purpose, we compared the histology of the DAC-exposed
tumors to the histology of similar-sized tumors from the shamtreated (PBS injected) KPC-Brca1 animals. Two differences,
namely, zonal necrosis and large areas of sarcomatoid change
in the malignant component, were evident on low-power
examination of the histologic sections from the DAC-treated
tumors compared with the vehicle control tumors. To unequivocally distinguish between sarcomatoid change in the tumor
cells, versus possible atypia in stromal cells mimicking sarcomatoid change, we used anti-p53 and anti-ASMA antibodies to
distinguish cells of neoplastic epithelial origin from reactive
myoﬁbroblasts. The results, from examining and quantifying
5 DAC and 5 PBS control cases, were quite striking: in the

DAC Therapy in PDAC

Figure 5. DAC produces strong increases of STAT1 in PDAC epithelial cells and DAZL in CAFs in the KPC-Brca1 tumors in vivo. A, immunostaining for STAT1
and STAT2 proteins in PDAC tumors from mice that received DAC or PBS vehicle control shows that DAC induces both proteins, with particularly
strong activation of STAT1 expression. B, IHC and immunoﬂuorescence showing strong induction of the testis antigen DAZL in the stromal myoﬁbroblasts of
the DAC-treated tumors.

DAC-treated tumors the ratio of CAFs (ASMA-positive cells) to
mutant p53-positive cells (tumor cells of malignant epithelial
origin) was markedly reduced (Supplementary Fig. S5). This
ﬁnding in the escaping tumors is consistent with the significant reduction in proliferation of CAFs that we had noted in

more acutely treated tumors (Fig. 3E). As the spindled morphology of the anaplastic escaping tumor cells in the DACtreated animals was strongly suggestive of a sarcomatoid
change in the escaping tumors, we evaluated these tumor
areas for the general mesenchymal marker vimentin. Widespread costaining for vimentin and mutant p53 in the same
cells conﬁrmed that these areas indeed consisted almost
entirely of malignant epithelial cells that had undergone
sarcomatoid change (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Discussion

Figure 6. DAC and the JAK-STAT activator IFN-g have an additive
antiproliferative effect on PDAC cells. Primary PDAC epithelial cells
isolated from the KPC-Brca1 mice and grown in short-term culture were
treated for 4 days with the indicated single agents or combinations of lowdose DAC (0.5 mmol/L) and IFN-g (100 ng/mL) as described in Materials
and Methods, followed by MTT assays for relative numbers of viable cells.
The results show an additive antiproliferative effect of DAC plus IFN-g.

Altered DNA methylation is a fundamental feature of human
cancers: promoter hypermethylation leading to silencing of
tumor suppressor genes and tumor antigens, aberrant methylation at speciﬁc imprinting control elements, and globally
reduced genomic methylation affecting repetitive elements are
general ﬁndings (39). Furthermore, genetic data in mouse
embryos leave no doubt that when nuclear DNA methylation
is lost to below a critical level cells become growth arrested or
nonviable (40). In several previously studied mouse models of
cancer, loss of Dnmt1 through genetic deletion or inhibition of
DNMT enzymes by DAC can delay tumor formation, with most
of these reports using chemopreventive protocols but with a
few studies now starting to assess DAC in combination with
other agents for treatment of established tumors (19, 20, 41–
44). This evidence from mouse models and the molecular
analysis of human tumors, together with clinical ﬁndings of
therapeutic beneﬁt from hypomethylating drugs in acute
myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome, have raised

the question of whether hypomethylating drugs might be
useful against common types of human carcinomas. Here, we
have shown that single-agent DAC treatment has a signiﬁcant
therapeutic beneﬁt in KPC-Brca1 triple genetically modiﬁed
mice that develop an aggressive stroma-rich form of PDAC. We
have further shown that this effect is mediated both through
inhibition of the malignant epithelial cells and their supportive
CAFs.
How do our results compare with other treatment protocols
in PDAC models? Comparing relative therapeutic efﬁcacy in
mouse models of cancer can be difﬁcult because of the
heterogeneity of the models and treatment protocols. In
particular, due to the slow kinetics of the KPC model, which
leads to a wide range in the time of tumor onset, most studies in
these mice have used tumor imaging to identify a relatively
large tumor size (5–7 mm) as the starting point of intervention.
The KPC-Brca1 model that we have used here is advantageous
in that there is progression to invasive cancer over a narrower
time window, thus allowing treatment protocols to be initiated
at a speciﬁc age of the animals, before the tumor have become
very advanced. On the other hand, our study carries the
limitation that there is some heterogeneity in tumor size at
the start of treatment. Despite these differences in study
design, the fractional extension in survival that we have
observed with single-agent DAC in the KPC-Brca1 mice seems
to be comparable with or greater than that seen in studies
with other agents in the related KPC model. Neither the
direct stromal acting hedgehog pathway inhibitors, nor the
stromal-acting enzyme hyaluronidase, led to single-agent
survival beneﬁts, but these agents had promising activity
when used in combination with cytotoxic agents. In our
study, DAC led to an increase in overall survival from 87 to
128 days, which compares favorably to those other studies,
even when compounds were being used in combination with
gemcitabine. For example, the survival beneﬁt observed by
targeting the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway was 25 days as
compared with 11 days in one experiment in which
IPI926þgemcitabine was compared with gemcitabine alone
in KPC mice (9). Cyclopamine, in another transgenic model
of Kras/Ink4Arf had a modest survival beneﬁt of 65 days as
compared with 61 days in controls (45). The pegylated
hyaluronidase had a more signiﬁcant effect in combination
with gemcitabine. In the KPC model it prolonged survival
from 55 to 91 days when started early (12) and from 9 to
28 days when started at larger tumor sizes (i.e., later time
point; ref. 11).
Although it seems unlikely that single-agent DAC treatment would be sufﬁcient in the treatment of human PDAC,
particularly if started after tumor progression on cytotoxic
therapy, it is important to recognize certain unique and
potentially advantageous features of this drug in comparison
with other drugs studied in PDAC. Most importantly, as it
acts to demethylate DNA only over the course of several cell
divisions, DAC is deliberately used in low doses, which have
low systemic toxicity. In this respect, DAC is a strong
candidate drug for use in combination with other anticancer
agents. The over-representation of cytokine signaling pathway genes that we report here in the set of transcripts

894

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

induced by DAC has been seen previously in other cell
systems (46), and these observations point to the possibility
of combining DAC with biologic agents in combination
therapy. Our experiments showing an additive effect of DAC
plus IFN-g on PDAC cells in culture directly support this
idea, and our ﬁnding that DAC induces strong expression of
the testis antigen DAZL in CAFs suggests that future studies
should test combinations of hypomethylating agents with
both cytokines and immunotherapy.
Another shift in paradigm that motivated us to investigate
DAC against PDAC is the increasing recognition of the synergy
between tumor cells and their microenvironment, conﬁrmed
here for the KPC-Brca1 model of PDAC in our mixing-allograft
experiment, and the realization that cancer-associated stromal
cells can undergo epigenetic changes, including global reduction in CpG methylation, that are analogous, though not
identical, to epigenetic alterations in the tumor cells themselves. These already reduced baseline levels of 5-mC may
contribute to the therapeutic index of DAC against both PDAC
cells and their associated CAFs. We have also shown here that
the distinct modiﬁcation 5-HmC differs very strikingly between
CAFs (high 5-HmC/5-mC ratio) and malignant epithelial cells
(lower 5-HmC/5-mC ratio). So, another question for future
research is whether genomic content of 5-HmC in cancer cells
and their supportive stromal cells will correlate with efﬁcacy of
speciﬁc epigenetically acting drugs. In summary, these preclinical results suggest that DAC or other hypomethylating
drugs may be useful in the treatment of human PDAC, particularly in combination with other rationally chosen drugs or
biologic agents.
