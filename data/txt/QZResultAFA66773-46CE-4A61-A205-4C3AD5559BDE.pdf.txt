BACKGROUND: Interferon is approved for adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IIB/III melanoma. The identification
of predictive markers that would permit selection of patients would be beneficial. Specific human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) class I and II antigens have previously shown an association with response to therapy or overall survival of patients
with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: A total of 284 high-risk melanoma patients participating in a randomized trial and
246 healthy controls were molecularly typed for HLA class I and II. Specific allele frequencies were compared between the
healthy and patient populations, as well as presence or absence of these in relation to recurrence. Alleles related to autoimmune disease were also investigated. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the distribution of
HLA genotype in the melanoma population compared with healthy controls. Correlations between nonrecurrence and
the presence of HLA-Cw*06 allele were noted present in 19.3% of melanoma patients. The median relapse-free survival
of the Cw*06-positive cohort was 100.2 months versus 37.3 months in the Cw*06-negative cohort (P ¼ .013). The median
overall survival for the Cw*06-positive cohort has not yet been reached, versus 78.9 months in the Cw*06-negative
cohort (P ¼ .025). HLA-Cw*06 was present in 29.79% of patients in the autoimmunity group and 15.38% of patients in
the nonautoimmunity group (P ¼ .049). CONCLUSIONS: No allele was associated with absence of recurrence in patients
receiving adjuvant interferon with the exception of HLA-Cw*06, an allele correlated with psoriasis. HLA-Cw*06-positive

Patients with stage IIB, IIC, and III melanoma as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC sixth
edition) are characterized as a group at high risk, with relapse and mortality risks exceeding 40% at 5 years.1 Several large
cooperative group trials have evaluated adjuvant therapy with high-dose interferon (IFN)-a2b in this patient population
and have consistently demonstrated significant prolongation of relapse-free survival (RFS) as compared with observation
or GM2 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and combined with the QS-21 adjuvant (GMK)-vaccine.2-4 Two
of these trials have also demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS).2,4 The pooled analysis of 4 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and intergroup trials conducted between 1984 and 2001 has shown a durable impact of
high-dose IFN on RFS, but not on OS.5 Analyses of the RFS and OS curves from the initial trial (E1684) revealed early
separation between the high-dose IFN-a2b and the observation arms.2 Therefore, the 1-month intravenous induction

phase of the regimen may be necessary and sufficient to
reduce the risk of recurrence, and several prospective trials
designed to test this hypothesis are currently ongoing or
have recently been reported.6
Unfortunately, acceptance of high-dose IFN-a2b
has been limited because of the toxicity and cost of this
regimen and the lack of a large survival benefit in metaanalyses.7,8 Evidence suggests that only a subset of patients
will benefit from this therapy. Nearly all patients experience side effects, including fatigue, fever, arthralgia, anorexia, hepatic toxicity, and depression that can be severe.
A better understanding of the mechanism of action of
IFN-a2b and identification of predictive markers that
would permit selection of patients most likely to benefit
would therefore be beneficial.
Serological typing for both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression has
previously shown an association between specific HLA
antigen expression and clinical response to therapy or OS
of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with interleukin (IL)-2 (eg, HLA-DQ1)9,10 or combinations of
IFN-a and IL-2.11 One report demonstrated an association of homozygosity of HLA-DR and decreased chance
of response to treatment with IL-2.12 The purpose of the
present study was to evaluate the role that HLA class I
or major histocompatibility complex I (determined at
low resolution) and HLA-DR/DQ or major histocompatibility complex II (determined at high-resolution) might
exert on the outcome of high-risk melanoma patients
receiving adjuvant high-dose interferon. The patients
included in this analysis were a subgroup of patients enrolled in a randomized phase 3 trial conducted by the
Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group to evaluate intravenous induction therapy with interferon alfa-2b for 4
weeks as compared with the same regimen followed by
11 months of adjuvant interferon alfa-2b therapy.
In addition, we compared HLA frequencies in melanoma patients and healthy controls (healthy unrelated
individuals from the Donor Marrow Registry of the
National Tissue Typing Center, Athens, Greece). Furthermore, because an increased risk of developing disease
recurrence as well as second primary melanomas in melanoma patients presenting with localized disease has been
associated with HLA-DQB1*0301 or HLA-DRB1*1101
alleles,13-16 we compared the frequency of these genotypes
in 2 groups of melanoma patients defined by outcome—
namely, those who remained free of recurrence and those
who have experienced disease recurrence. HLA alleles

were studied as a consequence of our observation of correlations between autoimmunity and disease outcome on
treatment with IFN.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Blood samples were collected with ACD anticoagulant
from 284 melanoma patients and a panel of 246 randomly selected healthy unrelated Greek individuals, who
served as a control population.
Patients participating in this study were enrolled in
Trial 13A/98, a prospective, multicenter, randomized
phase 3 trial conducted at 13 institutions by the Hellenic
Cooperative Oncology Group. In this trial, 364 patients
with histologically documented AJCC stage IIB, IIC, or III
primary cutaneous melanoma were enrolled between 1998
and 2004. For patients with clinically negative lymph
nodes, stage was defined pathologically using sentinel
lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Any patient with a positive
SLN was required to undergo complete lymphadenectomy.
All patients were randomized to receive protocol treatment
within 2 months of initial surgery or 1.5 months of therapeutic lymph node dissection. The regimen used was a
modification of the E1684 regimen.6 Group A patients
received IFN-a2b (15 MIU/m2/d intravenously 5 days per
week for 4 weeks) followed by observation. Group B
patients received the same induction dose for 4 weeks followed by subcutaneous therapy (10 MIU/day 3/wk) for
an additional 48 weeks. The primary endpoint for the core
protocol was RFS and OS by treatment group.
The HLA substudy reported here was conducted
prospectively at 4 institutions participating in the core
protocol. This substudy had separate institutional review
board approval, and all patients provided written
informed consent to this substudy. Blood samples for
evaluation of HLA were drawn at the same time as samples for routine initial visit clinical tests. The first 10 mL
of blood collected was used for standard biochemistry and
blood cell counts, and the second 3 mL was used for HLA
testing. Blood samples were obtained before treatment.
The clinical outcome of patients was prospectively
followed using standardized testing. Clinical staging consisted of medical history, physical exams, blood cell
counts, and blood biochemistry at 3-month intervals, and
chest x-ray and liver ultrasound at 6-month intervals.
Methods
DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted and isolated from
whole peripheral blood of all patients and controls, using

4327

Original Article

magnetic beads and Biorobot EZ1 (an automated instrument for nucleic acid purification) and a genetic extraction kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Genovision, Oslo, Norway; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
DNA was dissolved in doubly distilled H20, DNA concentration was estimated by measurement of OD260, and
purity was measured by the ratio of OD260/280. The
final preparation was stored at 20 C until further
analysis.
HLA Typing

Genomic HLA typing was performed using previously published DNA based techniques.18-20 Initially
HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB1, and -DQB1 low resolution
molecular typing was performed in all subjects, with
amplification of genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using locus-specific primers and reverse
hybridization with sequence and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, using a commercially available kit
(Lambda Array Beads Multi-Analyte System, LABType
RSS0, One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, Calif). Subsequently, high-resolution typing at the allele level of HLADRB1 and -DQB1 loci was implemented by PCR using
sequence-specific oligonucleotides (ELPHA HiRes, Biotest, Dreieich, Germany) and PCR with sequence-specific
primers (Olerup SSP, Saltsjoebaden, Sweden), respectively, following the manufacturers’ recommendations.
The allele assignment was made according to the HLAvisual software program.
Statistical Analysis
Allele frequencies were defined with 2 different
approaches. In the first approach, each individual was
used as a unit, and a particular allele was noted as present
if detected at least once in an individual. In the second
approach, the total number of detections of a particular allele was counted, that is, the allele presence was counted
once in heterozygous and twice in homozygous phenotypes. In this case, the allele frequency was calculated over
twice the number of individuals tested. Specific allele frequencies were calculated for both the patient population
and the healthy control population. Fisher exact test was
used for comparing the frequency of specific alleles (1 observation per patient) between the healthy and patient
populations as well as the frequency of recurrence between
the population in which the specific allele was present versus the population in which it was absent.
In addition, recurrence and specific allele frequencies were compared between patients with or without

development of autoimmunity.21 Development of autoimmunity was defined as either a positive test for autoantibodies or presentation with a clinical manifestation of
autoimmunity in the 12-month period during which
blood samples were analyzed for autoantibodies. Twosided P values were used with no adjustment to account
for multiple comparisons. The analyses presented here
should be considered as exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than conclusive. The relationship between
presence of specific alleles, autoimmune response (landmark analysis at 12 months), and patient RFS and OS
were further studied using Cox proportional hazard models. The landmark analysis includes patients without event
up to 12 months and still on follow-up at 12 months.
They are classified by whether they had autoimmunity,
based on their autoimmunity status at 12 months, that is,
after the last evaluation of autoimmunity was performed.21
Survival was evaluated from the date protocol treatment
was started to the date of last follow-up or date of death
from any cause. RFS was calculated from the initiation of
treatment to the date on which relapse was first documented or on which death without documented relapse
occurred. The reverse censoring method was used for calculating descriptive statistics; for the follow-up time, KaplanMeier estimates of RFS and OS are presented.22 For all alleles presented, the ones with frequency <5% in the melanoma population are not included in the analysis.
Alleles defined a priori were: HLA-A*02, HLAB*35, HLA-Cw*04, HLA-Cw*06, HLA-Cw*07, HLADQB1*0301, HLA-DQB1*0501, *0502, *0503, *0504,
HLA-DQB1*0601, *0602, *0603, *0604, *0605, *0608,
*0609 (HLA DQB1*05 and HLA DQB1*06 correspond
to previously serologically typed HLA-DQ1), HLADRB1*1101, HLA-DRB1*03, and HLA-DRB1*04. The
possibility of chance deviation still exists without correction, and for this reason we consider P values between .01
and .05 as probably significant, as suggested by others.23
SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), was used for statistical
analysis, whereas RFS and OS curves were generated with
SPSS version 15.

RESULTS
The frequency patterns of HLA class I and II were first
evaluated in the healthy control and melanoma populations. Eleven HLA alleles were found to be significantly
different between the melanoma patients and the healthy
control population. For the remainder, no significant differences between the distribution of HLA genotype were

found in the melanoma population compared with the
healthy control population. The alleles that differed
among melanoma patients were HLA-A*03, HLAB*037, *53, *54, *58, *59, *78, HLA-DRB1*1102,
HLA-DQB1*0201, and *0302 with corresponding
P values .042, .033, .050, .046, .001, .021, .004, .021,
.006 and .033, respectively. Most of these alleles are represented in <10% in both populations.
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics
have been described elsewhere.6,21 With a median followup of 70.67 months (only among patients alive [censored
values], range, 7.1-138.7 months), there were 156 recurrences and 104 deaths. The association of HLA genotype
with absence of recurrence is presented in Table 1. Correlations between nonrecurrence (alive/well vs recurrent/
dead) and the presence of MHC class I allele HLA-Cw*06
and MHC class II allele HLA-DRB1*1501 were noted
with the corresponding P values .035 and .045, although
these are not corrected for multiple testing. When we
examined the gene frequency, no further information was
acquired on the predictive value of HLA. This was the

case also in comparing gene frequency between healthy
controls and melanoma patients.
Comparison of RFS and OS for previously defined
alleles of interest also showed no statistically significant
difference among the other alleles investigated (A*02,
B*35, Cw*04, Cw*07, DQB1*0301, DRB1*1101,
DRB1*03, DRB1*04, DQB1*05 þ *06) with the exception of Cw*06. The median RFS of the Cw*06-positive
cohort was 100.2 months (range, 2.7-100.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] not evaluable) versus 37.3 months in
the Cw*06-negative cohort (range, 1.1-115.1; 95% CI
21.1-53.5; P ¼ .013). The median OS of the Cw*06-positive cohort has not yet been reached (observed minimum
and maximum death times 9.8 and 84.2 months; 95% CI
not evaluable) versus 78.9 months in the Cw*06-negative
cohort (range, 2.3-86.1; 95% CI not evaluable), with a P
value of .025. Apart from HLA-Cw*06, stage was found
to be an independent predictor for RFS (P ¼ .029) and
OS (P ¼ .013) in univariate analysis. The association of
HLA-Cw*06 with RFS and OS was explored through a
multivariate Cox model including lymph node involvement, ulceration, and stage. In the presence of HLACw*06 in the Cox model, only stage was found to be an
independent predictor for RFS (P ¼ .010) and OS (P ¼
.0011). Controlling for disease stage, the P values for the
association of Cw*06 with RFS and OS are .018 and
.039, respectively. Treatment duration and interaction of
treatment duration by HLA-Cw*06 were found nonsignificant, when included in the multivariate Cox models for
RFS and OS (P ¼ .20 and P ¼ .46, respectively for RFS;
P ¼ .33 and P ¼ .86, respectively for OS), along with
HLA-Cw*06 and autoimmunity. The Kaplan-Meier
curves for RFS and OS in the A*02 and Cw*06 cohorts
are presented in Figures 1 and 2. The median OS of the
B*35-positive cohort was 69.2 months (range, 8.0-86.1;
95% CI, 49.3-89.1) and has not yet been reached for the
B*35-negative cohort (range, 2.3-84.2; 95% CI not evaluable), with P ¼ .040 and P ¼ .1383 when controlling for
disease stage. No differences were observed in RFS (P ¼
.143 and P ¼ .2141 when controlling for disease stage).
In the cohort of patients included in the prospective
autoimmunity study, allele frequency was investigated in
155 of 200 patients (47 in the autoimmunity group and
108 in the nonautoimmunity group). HLA-Cw*06 was
expressed in 29.79% (14 of 47) of patients in the autoimmunity group and 15.38% (16 of 108) of patients in the
nonautoimmunity group (P ¼ .049). Statistical significant differences were seen in HLA-B*35 (21.28% vs
41.35%; P ¼ .018) and HLA-DRB1*0701 (23.4% vs

7.69%; P ¼ .015, respectively). No differences were
seen in the expression of HLA-A*02 (31.91% vs 48.8%;
P ¼ .077).
In the landmark model for the association of Cw*06
with RFS, Cw*06 and autoimmunity were statistically significant (P ¼ .020 and P < .0001, respectively). In the
landmark model for the association of Cw*06 with OS,
only autoimmunity was statistically significant (P <
.0001). In the landmark models for the association of
HLA-B*35, HLA-DRB1*0701, and HLA-A*02 with
RFS or OS, only autoimmunity was found statistically significant (P < .0001). For all other cases, interaction
between alleles and autoimmunity was also tested, but it
was found to be insignificant.

To answer these questions, it was first necessary to define
a baseline population for comparison. No database was
available that describes the prevalence of HLA alleles
among Greek melanoma patients. Several reports have analyzed the HLA genotypes in North American Caucasian,
Italian, Spanish, and Scandinavian populations, yielding
conflicting data.10,24-26 No significant differences were
seen in the HLA profiles of the Greek healthy control and
melanoma populations studied here.
In the E2690 laboratory corollary of the intergroup
adjuvant trial E1690, among patients expressing HLAA*02, IFN-a2b treatment had a lesser impact on RFS
(P ¼ .02) compared with the observation arm; among
patients not expressing HLA-A*02, the RFS was better for

from trial E1690 (P ¼ .16). The test for interaction
between treatment and HLA-A*02 status was marginally
significant (P ¼ .06). Therefore, this apparent interaction
may be a statistical artifact. In our group of patients, the
outcome of HLA-A*02-positive patients did not differ
from the HLA-A*02-negative cohort in terms both of
RFS and OS. Although patients in these 2 studies are of
different ethnic backgrounds (North American Caucasian
and Southern European Caucasian), and the methods
used for HLA typing differed (serological in the E2690
and molecular in the present), the percentages of HLAA*02 are similar; 42.7% and 46.8%, respectively. Likewise, other class I alleles such as A*11, or class II alleles
such as HLA-DQ1, an allele related to the susceptibility
to autoimmune diseases,28 initially found to be associated
with clinical response and survival with IL-2 therapy in
the metastatic setting,9,10 were not found to be related to
absence of recurrence in our group of patients. Interpretation of the results in the IL-2–treated patients should take
into consideration the caveats associated with retrospective studies involving a relatively limited number of
patients not homogenously treated along with uncorrected statistical correlations. Similarly, in our study there
are potential weaknesses in identifying differences in outcome based on HLA status, possibly including a subset of
patients participating in a randomized trial in which half
of the patients received 1 month and half 1 year of adjuvant interferon, as well as the mixed-stage patient population. In addition, the large number of tests performed
exploring possible associations between HLA and disease,
recurrence, and autoimmune response would lead to
some significant results occurring by chance without biological significance. Thus, the analyses presented here
should be considered as exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than conclusive. Moreover, in an updated
report on 272 patients treated with IL-2–based therapy at
the National Institutes of Health, no significant association between HLA type and response was observed.12
However, in other immune strategies for melanoma such
as polyvalent melanoma, cell vaccine OS after treatment
correlated with HLA phenotypes.29 However, it is important to mention that both resolution and reliability of
molecular HLA typing has substantially improved during
the last decade, which has led to partial revisions in HLA
associations.
Similarly, no differences were seen when patients
were divided according to the presence or absence of HLAB*35, HLA-Cw*04, HLA-Cw*07, HLA-DRB1*301,
HLA-DRB1*04, or HLA-DRB1*1101, alleles associated

with thyroiditis (postpartum thyroiditis, Hashimoto disease), rheumatoid arthritis, Sicca syndrome, and diabetes,17
or HLA-DQB1*0301, previously correlated with recurrence in stage I and II melanoma patients. We investigated
HLA alleles that are correlated with a higher risk of specific
autoimmune diseases, as we have previously shown that the
appearance of autoantibodies and/or clinical signs of autoimmunity are strongly associated with improved RFS and
OS in patients with melanoma who are receiving adjuvant
therapy with high-dose IFNa2b.23 Failure to demonstrate
the association of thyroid autoimmunity with certain
HLA types in this study might in part be explained by the
finding that their presence increases the probability by no
more than 3-fold in most cases.17 Moreover, this observation suggests that the IFNa2b-related induction of autoimmunity in melanoma patients differs from spontaneously
occurring autoimmune disorders with respect to HLA
genetics and presumably also in other aspects of this multifactorial process. This is not surprising, because the current
understanding of the development of thyroid autoimmunity suggests a T-cell–mediated disease with mostly
unknown multifactorial etiology, such as infection or
chronic inflammation with a strong genetic component.30
Thus, different routes of autoimmunity may be associated
with different sets of genes. Nevertheless, it is most interesting that HLA-Cw*06-positive patients have better RFS
and OS (P ¼ .013 and P ¼ .025, respectively), which
remains statistically significant for RFS even in the presence
of autoimmunity (P ¼ .020). In addition, a statistically
higher percentage of Cw*06-positive individuals was present in the cohort of patients who developed autoimmunity.
Although the Cw*06 allele has been correlated with psoriasis, the IFNa2b-related autoimmunity was not limited to
the skin, affecting other organs as well.
As none of the HLA class II alleles showed significant positive or negative association with the exception of
Cw*06, this result is presented here to allow others to consider the evaluation of this issue in trials of IFN-a2b that
are being conducted in separate US and European cooperative groups. In particular, as Cw*06-positive patients
may have slower-growing melanomas irrespective of IFN
therapy, this allele may thus be a prognostic rather than a
predictive marker. A validation set of non–IFN-treated
melanoma patients should be examined to evaluate this
hypothesis. The exploration of this finding in melanoma
patients matched for HLA type and adjusted for stage
from data sets of randomized controlled trials with an observation arm would answer this question. A final question arises in regard to the correlation of Cw*06 and

4332

favorable prognosis of melanoma: the expression of this
allele is also correlated with the development of psoriasis,
a proinflammatory disorder of the skin in which patients
are intolerant of IFNa. It was recently shown that the fraction of patients who benefitted from IFN therapy in the
randomized intergroup trial E1694 and were alive at 5 or
more years correlates with elevated pretreatment blood
serum levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor a, IL-1a, and
IL-1b.31 The correlation of Cw*06 and elevation of
proinflammatory cytokines is thus a new topic of interest
in view of the findings reported in this study.
