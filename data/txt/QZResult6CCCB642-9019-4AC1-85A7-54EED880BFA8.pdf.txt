Abstract
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a malignant disease caused by human
T-lymphotropic virus type 1. In aggressive ATL, the response to chemotherapy is
extremely poor. We hypothesized that this poor response is due to the existence of
chemotherapy-resistant cells, such as leukemic stem cells. Previously, we successfully
identified an ATL stem cell (ATLSC) candidate as the c-kit+/CD38−/CD71− cells in an
ATL mouse model using Tax transgenic mice. Here, with a new ATL mouse model using
HBZ-transgenic mice, we further discovered that the functional ATLSC candidate,
which commonly expresses c-kit, is drug-resistant and has the ability to initiate
tumors and reconstitute lymphomatous cells. We characterized the ATLSCs as c-kit+/
CD4−/CD8− cells and found that they have a similar gene expression profile as T
cell progenitors. Additionally, we found that AP-1 gene family members, including
Junb, Jund, and Fosb, were up-regulated in the ATLSC fraction. The results of an in
vitro assay showed that ATLSCs cultured with cytokines known to promote stem
cell expansion, such as stem cell factor (SCF), showed highly proliferative activity
and maintained their stem cell fraction. Inhibition of c-kit–SCF signaling with the
neutralizing antibody ACK2 affected ATLSC self-renewal and proliferation. Experiments
in Sl/Sld mice, which have a mutation in the membrane-bound c-kit ligand, found
that ATL development was completely blocked in these mice. These results clearly
suggest that the c-kit–SCF signal plays a key role in ATLSC self-renewal and in ATL
initiation and disease progression.

Introduction

signs, but approximately 3-5% of HTLV-1 carriers
develop ATL [4]. Although combination chemotherapy
has been promising in patients with indolent type ATL,
the prognosis is much worse for patients with the most
aggressive ATL type, with frequent resistance to or early
relapse after intensive polychemotherapy [5, 6].

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a peripheral T cell
leukemia caused by infection with human T-lymphotropic
virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [1, 2]. HTLV-1 infection mainly
occurs through breast-feeding, and after a long latency
period, HTLV-1 infected cells finally develop into ATL
cells [3]. Most infectious carriers never show any clinical

characterized by tumor initiating ability, self-renewal, and
drug resistance and are a phenotypically and molecularly
distinct rare population that can reproduce original
tumor cell types in in vivo transplantation assays, has
been hypthesized [8]. The CSC hypothesis is supported
experimentally by findings from some hematological
malignancies [9-13] and solid tumors [14, 15]. These
findings provide strong evidence that CSCs might have
a key role in cancer development and chemotherapy
resistance.
Recent studies suggest that ATL cells are
phenotypically [16, 17], functionally, and molecularly
heterogeneous [18]. Indeed, using criteria that CSCs
harbor a high dye efflux function associated with drug
resistance [19, 20], we found a functional ATL stem cell
(ATLSC) candidate in an ATL mouse model using Taxtransgenic (Tax-Tg) mice [21, 22]. El Haji et al. also
reported a tumor initiating ability in ATL cells from a TaxTg ATL mouse model, suggesting that these cells could be
a therapeutic target for ATL [23]. More recently, Nagai et
al. reported that T memory stem cells are responsible for
the hierarchical apex of ATL that can reproduce patient
ATL types in recipient immunodeficient mice [24]. These
data strengthen the idea that rare ATLSCs might play a
key role in ATL development and progression. However,
it is still unclear what common feature of ATLSCs could
be used as a molecular therapy target and which HTLV1 factor and genetic pathway cause ATLSC development
and regulation.
Here, we show strong evidence that ATLSCs exist
in another mouse model of ATL using HBZ-transgenic
mice (HBZ-Tg). Although HTLV-1 Tax transcripts are
only detected in about 60% of ATL cases [25, 26], the
HTLV-1 b-zip factor (HBZ) gene is expressed in all ATL
cases, and HBZ induced ATL/lymphoma development in
vivo [27]. We also report that a common surface marker of
ATLSCs, c-kit, is a key regulator of ATL disease initiation
and progression. Thus, our findings support the ATLSC
hypothesis and indicate that c-kit-SCF (stem cell factor)
signaling could be a therapeutic target for ATL.

liver, and ovary hypertrophy (Figure 1B). All recipient
Ly5.1 mice showed body weight loss (data not shown),
hepatosplenomegaly, and died within 30 days posttransplantation. The spleen, liver, and ovary weights were
significantly increased in the recipient mice compared
with those in control mice (no transplant, NT) (Figure 1C).
Massive tumor cell infiltration can be seen in the recipient
mouse spleen and ovaries. The numbers of MNCs,
including lymphoma cells in the peripheral blood (PB),
spleen, ovaries, LNs, and thymus, were also significantly
higher in recipient mice than in NT mice (Figure 1D).
To characterize the lymphoma cell phenotype
in each of the infiltrated tissues, we performed FACS
analyses of previously identified surface antigens observed
in the HBZ-Tg mouse model. Ht48 cells were classified
into CD4 single-positive (4SP), CD8 single-positive
(8SP), and CD4/CD8 double-positive or -negative (DP and
DN cells, respectively) cells. The majority of the donor
Ht48 cells were 8SP, DP, or DN. A similar phenotype to
that observed in donor Ht48 cells was also detected in the
recipient spleen, BM, PB, ovaries, and liver but not in the
recipient LNs or thymus (Figure 1E).
Another ATL cell phenotypes previously reported in
the Tax-Tg mouse model of ATL [22], CD38+ and CD71+,
was also evaluated in this HBZ-Tg model. In the major
ATL cell population, both CD71+ and CD38+ cells were
detected in the recipient spleen, PB, and BM but were not
observed in the recipient ovaries, liver, LN, or thymus
(Figure 1F). By using two different phenotypic analyses
of mouse ATL cells, both Ht48 cell phenotypes (CD38+
and CD71+) can be commonly detected in the recipient
PB, BM, and spleen. We calculated the average number
of Ht48 cells in each of the hematopoietic and lymphoid
tissues (Figure 1G) and found that the spleen is the most
efficient tissue for Ht48 proliferation.
HBZ expression in recipient mice was also detected
by FACS analysis in splenic Ht48 cells (Figure 1H), and
it was high in the DP, 8SP, and 4SP subsets (Figure 1I). A
similar observation was made in the histological spleen
sections. The ATL cells can be seen in the spleen, BM
(Figure 2A and 2B), ovaries, and liver (data not shown).
CD3+ T cells can be observed in the spleen, BM, and
ovaries (Figure 2C-2F). In the spleen, CD3+ cells were
found in the T cell-rich region but not in the B cell-rich
follicle (Figure 2G) and near the red pulp (Figure 2H). To
identify the splenic ATL cells, we investigated the HBZ
expression in spleen sections using in situ hybridization.
We found that some HBZ-expressing Ht48 cells can be
seen in the splenic CD3+ cell-rich region (Figure 2I2J). Together, these findings suggest that the spleen is
the major site of ATL cell proliferation in vivo and that
splenic ATL cells possess tumor initiating capacity, both
phenotypically and functionally.

Results
HBZ-expressing mouse ATL cells possess tumor
initiating ability
In this study, we used ATL cells (named Ht48)
isolated from an HBZ-Tg mouse [27, 28]. To assess
the tumor initiating and regeneration abilities of Ht48
cells in vivo, we transplanted 1×107 Ht48 cells into the
C57BL/6-Ly5.1 mouse (Ly5.1) strain whose cells can be
distinguished from the donor cells by FACS (Figure 1A).
As in the donor HBZ-Tg mouse, ATL-like lymphoma
in the recipient mouse can be recognized as spleen,

Ht48 cells with tumor initiating ability act as stem
cells in vivo

transplantation died at similar rates during this period
(Figure 4G). Because approximately 5% of Ht48 cells are
c-kit+ (Figure 4B), we speculated that 1×106 unfractionated
Ht48 cells likely contain 5×104 c-kit+ cells. Thus, we next
intraperitoneally injected 5×101-3 c-kit+ Ht48 cells or 1×106
Ht48 cells as a control into the Ly5.1 mice to assess the
c-kit+ cell tumor initiating ability (Figure 4H). No mice
died after receiving 5×101 c-kit+ cells, but over half of
the mice (3/5) died after receiving 5×103 c-kit+ cells. The
survival rate of the recipient mice gradually decreased in a
dose dependent manner (Figure 4I). A phenotypic analysis
of post-transplantation Ht48 cells revealed that different
numbers of transplanted c-kit+ cells all caused ATL
development like transplanted bulk Ht48 cells (Figure
4J and 4K). Together, these data clearly suggest that the
population of c-kit+ Ht48 cells may contain functional
ATLSCs.

To assess the capacity of Ht48 cells to act as
stem cells and evaluate their tumor initiating ability, we
designed a serial transplantation experiment. For each
serial transplantation experiment, we transplanted 1-4×107
Ht48 cells isolated from former recipient lymphomas that
developed in Ly5.1 mouse spleens into new recipient mice.
We performed thirteen consecutive serial transplantation
experiments (Figure 3A). The recipient mice died within
15-25 days in each of the transplantation experiments
(Figure 3B). Consistent with the results described above,
both the spleen tissue weight and total MNC number
were significantly increased in recipient mice compared
with those in NT mice (Figure 3C). We also performed
FACS analyses to identify if Ht48 cells were capable of
regenerating the original tumor phenotype in recipient
mice. Similar Ht48 cell phenotypes (4SP, 8SP, DP, DN
and CD38+/CD71+) were observed in the recipient mice
following each serial transplantation experiment (Figure
3D and 3E). These data suggest that functional ATLSCs
with a self-renewal activity may exist among Ht48 cells.

c-kit+ DN cells have ex vivo self-renewal capacity
in vivo
To assess the role of SCF-c-kit signaling in
ATLSC self-renewal, we first cultured 1×104 Ht48 cells
with or without stem cell expansion-inducing cytokines
(StemExpM: TPO, IL-6, Flt3, IL-3, and SCF) or a T
cell expansion-inducing cytokine (TcellExpM: IL-2)
(Figure 5A) for 6 days. The total Ht48 cell number was
not changed among these groups within the 6-day culture
(Figure 5B), but only the StemExpM increased the
percentage of c-kit+DN (KDN) cells (Figure 5C and 5D).
These data suggest that only StemExpM preserves ATLSC
renewal, in vitro.
We next cultured 1×104 c-kit+ Ht48 cells with or
without StemExpM for 6 days. As expected, the total cell
number increased significantly more when the c-kit+ Ht48
cells were grown in StemExpM than in control medium
(Figure 5E). Additionally, growth in the StemExpM
induced more KDN cells than growth in control medium
(Figure 5F). These data suggest that the c-kit+ ATLSCs
were highly repopulated when the cells were grown in the
StemExpM.
To understand which c-kit+ cell type contributes
to Ht48 stem cell repopulation, we sorted Ht48 cells and
cultured the KDN, c-kit+ DP (KDP), c-kit+4SP (K4SP),
and c-kit+8SP (K8SP) cells in StemExpM (Figure 5H).
The KDN population proliferated more than 50-fold in
the StemExpM (Figure 5I and 5J). Together our findings
suggest that the KDN population may contain ATLSCs, so
we transplanted 5×103 KDN Ht48 cells into Ly5.1 mice.
As when 1×106 Ht48 cells were transplanted, the mice that
were transplanted with 5×103 KDN Ht48 cells died within
40 days (Figure 5K) and the original ATL lymphoma was
recapitulated in recipient mouse spleens (Figure 5L-5N).

A subpopulation of high drug efflux capacity
and c-kit expression cells exist in the Ht48 cell
population
To identify Ht48 cell ATLSC candidates, we
performed a SP analysis that has been used previously
to identify drug-resistant CSCs in various tumors4.
Ht48 cells were divided into three SPs based on their
Hoechst33342-low-fluorescence profile: the tip-SP
fraction (Tip-SP; 0.029%), the mid-SP population (MidSP; 0.87%), and the major population (MP; 97.9%)
(Figure 4A). The ABCG transporter inhibitor, verapamil,
effectively blocked the emergence of nearly all Tip-SP
and most Mid-SP Ht48 cells. We found that > 65% of the
Tip-SP cells were ATLSC surface marker, c-kit+ while
< 10% of the non-SP fraction cells (MPs) were c-kit+
(Figure 4B-4C). Approximately 5% of the total Ht48 cell
population were c-kit+, and of the c-kit+ cells, most were
8SP, followed by DP, DN, and 4SP cells (Figure 4D).
The c-kit+ cells in the Tip-SP and Mid-SP fractions were
mainly composed of DN cells ( > 70%), whereas the c-kit+
MP cells were predominantly composed of 8SP and DP
(Figure 4E). These results suggest that the c-kit+ ATLSC
candidate with a high drug efflux capacity is enriched in
the SP fractions and has a DN phenotype.
To assess the tumor repopulation ability of the c-kit+
Ht48 cells, we transplanted 5×103 c-kit+ or c-kit− cells into
Ly5.1 mice (Figure 4F). Whereas the mice that received a
5×103 c-kit− Ht48 cell transplantation lived for the entire
observation period (80 days), the mice that received a
1×106 unfractionated Ht48 cell or 5×103 c-kit+ Ht48 cell

cell subsets as compared with normal KDN. Expression
data for 28,305 genes were acquired, and the resulting
heat-map shows partitioning of five samples and the
15,882 genes. A hierarchical clustering analysis clearly
shows that there are two distinct Ht48 cell populations;
the KDN and SP cells are different from the c-kit+ Ht48
cells and unfractionated Ht48 cells (Figure 6A). A similar
clustering result was obtained in the immune regulatory
genes (Supplemental Figure 1) and thymic early T-cell
precursor (ETP) upregulated genes (Figure 6B). Among
ETP gene set, we found HTLV-1 infection inducing gene,
Nfe2 and Id2 upregulation both in the SP and KDN cells.
Thus, we next analyzed the expression pattern of HTLV1 and ATL related genes [29-34] in our mouse model. A
similar clustering result was obtained in the ATL-related
genes (Supplemental Figure 2). Among the 250 ATLrelated genes, 43 genes, including, AP-1 family genes,
Fos and Jun, were up regulated both in Ht48 SP cells and
KDN cells (Figure 6C). We next analyzed the AP-1 gene
family member expression patterns in our mouse model
and found Jun, Junb, and Jund were upregulated in Ht48
SP cells (Figure 6D). We used q-PCR to confirm the gene
expression levels of randomly selected (Hlf, Tie1) or AP-1
family genes that are differentially expressed in KDN
cells. Whereas the HBZ expression level was not changed
between the Ht48 cells and the ATLSC candidates (Figure
6D), the expression levels of Hlf, Tie1, Junb, Jund, and
Fosb were upregulated in ATLSC candidates (Figure 6E6G). Then, we used a Primeflow assay, which can detect
mRNA expression, and found mActb-. HBZ-, Hlf-, Tie1-,
JunB-, JunD-, expressing cells were detected among the
KDN cells (Figure 6G). Finally, we listed the top 330
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

genes highly expressed in SP cells (Supplemental Table 3).

c-kit-SCF signaling plays a key role in ATL
progression in vivo
To confirm the role of c-kit-SCF signaling in ATLSC
self-renewal, we blocked the c-kit signaling in vitro by
neutralizing the c-kit receptor with the neutralizing
antibody ACK2. Although StemExpM stimulates c-kit+
cell proliferation, ACK2 effectively blocked the c-kit+
cell proliferation as did StemExpM lacking SCF (Figure
7A). SCF neutralization in vitro also reduced ATLSC
self-renewal (Figure 7B). The KDN Ht48 cell number
dramatically reduced in StemExpM with ACK2 or lacking
SCF.
To clarify the role of c-kit-SCF signaling in vivo,
we transplanted 1×106 Ht48 cells into Sl/Sld mice. These
mice lack membrane-bound SCF, which is essential for
hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation
[35] (Figure 7C). Because most Sl/Sld mice die by 15
weeks old owing to severe anemia, we used 8 weeks old
Sl/Sld mice and evaluated an engraftment of ATL cells
20-30 days after transplantation. No ATL development
was detected in the recipient Sl/Sld mice. The spleen
weight and MNC number in recipient Sl/Sld mice were
lower than those in recipient Ly5.1 mice (Figure 7D). ATL
cells, including 4SP, 8SP, and DP, were not observed in
the Sl/Sld mouse spleens and thymuses (Figure 7E). These
data suggest that c-kit-SCF signaling is essential for ATL
development and progression in vivo.

Discussion

CSC hypothesis [37, 38] was proposed to explain the cause
of ATL chemotherapy resistance [39]. Here, we found that
ATLSC candidates display a c-kit+/CD4−/CD8− phenotype
in the HBZ-Tg ATL mouse model. ATLSCs have distinct
phenotypic, genetic, and functional properties than the
majority of ATL cells and can reconstitute the original
ATL in recipient mice many times over and maintain a

ATL is a malignant disease of mature T cells caused
by HTLV-1 infection [1.2] that has a poor prognosis
owing to the resulting severe immune-suppression and its
intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy [36]. Recently, the

SP phenotype with a high drug efflux capacity [39]. These
findings, together with our previous data, suggest that both
Tax and HBZ might have the ability to induce leukemia
stem cell properties in mouse T cells by inducing a high
drug efflux ability.
The global gene expression study results indicate
that many HBZ-interacting genes, such as the AP-1
family genes including c-Jun, Junb [40], and Jund [41],
which are associated with leukemogenesis, are highly
upregulated in ATLSCs. AP-1 family genes c-fos, c-Jun,
Atf, and Jdp were also regulated by HTLV-1 Tax [42,
43], and they are involved in many cellular processes,
such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
Interestingly, AP-1 and downstream microRNA-21
(miR-21) were upregulated in highly chemoresistant SP
cells in several cell lines, and AP-1 inhibition reversed
the chemoresistance and colony forming ability of SP
cells [44]. Additionally, downregulation of junB/AP-1
transcription factor recapitulates the clinical aspects
of CML [45] and AML [46] and JunB deficiency leads
to a CSC-mediated myloproliferative disorder [47, 48].
Our microarray data show that Junb and Jund were also
upregulated in the ATLSC fraction, and this finding was
confirmed with the results from both q-PCR and FACS
assays. Thus, both HBZ and Tax may induce or disrupt
the AP-1 gene expression network and finally induce
CSC properties, including the SP cell phenotype, in vivo.
Further analyses are needed to confirm and reveal the
molecular network underlining ATLSC development via
the AP-1 gene family.
ATLSCs from both Tax- and HBZ-driven ATL
commonly expressed c-kit, and the c-kit-SCF signaling
pathway plays a major role in CSC-mediated ATL
progression. Therefore, the SCF-c-kit signaling pathway
is a possible therapeutic target in ATL. In mice, c-kit is a
key regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
as well as testicular and intestinal cells [49]. Inhibition
of c-kit kinase activity has been found several cancers.
In AML, approximately 85% of AML cells express c-kit
[50], and SCF combined with IL-3 stimulates massive
AML cell proliferation [51]. Despite our previously
published findings, it remained unknown if most ATL cells
express c-kit. A distinct subset of self-renewing human
memory CD8+ T cells with high dye efflux properties that
expressed c-kit similarly to the Ht48 cells in our model has
been reported [52]. Recent clinical studies also highlight
the existence of ATLSCs in the ATL patient T memory
stem cell fraction [53]. It is still unknown if T memory
stem cells in ATL require SCF-c-kit signaling, and further
functional studies are needed to determine if c-kit+ cells
also possess CSC properties in human ATL cases.
When we compared ATLSCs with normal
c-kit+CD4/8DN cell counterparts in a DNA microarray
analysis, we found that each fraction showed a similar
gene expression pattern suggesting that ATLSCs are of
stem/progenitor cell origin or were reprogrammed into
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

immature cell types by HTLV-1 infection.
In the thymus, immature T cell progenitors, DN1
cells [53], which express high levels of c-kit contain the
most immature T lineage progenitors (ETPs) [54]. ETPs
are derived from human stem cells but are non-renewing
progenitors that have retained a limited multi-lineage
differentiation potential. Oncogenically transformed
ETPs might be one cause of recurrent leukemia, and
they respond poorly to chemotherapy in T cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [55]. In our analysis, the ETP
gene set was also reclassified in HBZ-Tg ATL cells (Figure
6B) as well as in the global and immune gene sets. These
data suggest that ATLSCs might acquire ETP properties
or may maintain ETP properties during HTLV-1 infection.
Because HTLV-1 infection occurs via breast feeding, and
ETPs arise from the BM and are thought to migrate to
the thymus during embryonic and postnatal development,
ETPs may be a possible HTLV-1 infection target and long
latency target for ATLSCs.
Recent studies suggest that human CD4/8DN cells
may act as a reservoir of persistent of HIV-1 [56] and are
associated with HIV-1 seroconversion [57]. Interestingly,
CD4/8DN T cells still persist throughout highly active
antiretroviral therapy suggesting that CD4/8DN T cells
may affect drug resistance [58]. In addition, CD4/8DN T
cells may play a variety of roles in the immune system,
such as immune response, autoimmunity, immune
tolerance in transplantation, and antitumor activity [59].
These data suggest that ATLSCs may play various roles in
ATL development.
Although most of HBZ- expressing ATL cells
(Ht48 cells) migrate into spleen like other T-ALL model
[60], we found that HBZ-expressing ATL cells migrate
and infiltrate into the ovaries (Figures 1 and 2). In nonHodgkin lymphoma, although 7-25% of lymphoma cells
infiltrate the ovaries [61], lymphomas arising primarily in
extra-nodal sites (pENL) are extremely rare. Some pENL
are associated with an underlying immunodeficiency
syndrome, such as HIV/AIDS, or with an infection, such
as Epstein-Barr virus, HTLV-1, human herpesvirus-8, or
hepatitis C [62].
Most lymphoma cells are B cells, although some
T cell and natural killer cell lymphomas were reported
in the female genital tract [63]. In ATL, there are only
a few reports that ATL cells infiltrate into the ovaries;
many studies did not examine the ovarian involvement.
Interestingly, an HTLV-1-inducible gene, TSCL1,
promotes ovarian infiltration by an ATL cell line in the
NOG mouse model [64]. Additionally, ATL-derived factor
(ADF) has been detected in the human ovary throughout
the menstrual cycle with high production levels during
pregnancy [65]. ADF induces IL-2Ra in HTLV-1-infected
cells [66] and promotes the proliferation of HTLV-1infected cells. Because SCF is also produced in the
ovaries [67] we speculate that both ADF and SCF might
act as chemoattractive factors to entice HTLV-1-infected

cells and ATLSCs. These data also indicate the ovaries,
an immune-privileged organ [68], may be a possible new
niche for HTLV-1-infected cells or ATLSC refuges during
the long latency period.

Materials and Methods
Mice
All mouse experiments were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute
of Infectious Disease, Tokyo, Japan. C57BL/6-Ly5.1
mice congenic for the CD45 locus were purchased from
Sankyo-Labo. Sl/Sld mice (WBB6F1/kit-Kitsl /Kitsl-d/
Slc) were purchased from SLC, Inc.

Cell culture
We cultured each Ht48 cell fraction with IL-3, SCF,
IL-6 (20 ng/mL each), Flt3-L, and IL-3 (4 ng/mL each) in
RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS for 6 days. All cytokines were
obtained from Peprotech Inc (Supplemental Table 1).

Serial transplantation

Microarray analysis

We used Ht48 cells, which are splenic ATL
cells established from HBZ-Tg mice [28], for the first
transplantation. ATL-like lymphoma and leukemia was
first established in a female, 6-8-week-old C57BL/6-Ly5.1
mouse by an intraperitoneal injection of 3.5×107 frozen
Ht48 cells. After 15 days, ATL-like lymphoma developed
in the recipient mouse spleen, and the resulting Ht48
cells were capable of regenerating the original ATL-like
lymphoma when further injected into new recipient mice.
Using this transplantation system, Ht48 cells were serially
passed as required.

Total RNA was amplified and labeled with cyanine
3 (Cy3) using an Agilent Low Input Quick Amp Labeling
Kit (Agilent). cRNA quantity and Cy3 incorporation were
determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. For each hybridization,
600 ng of Cy3-labeled cRNA were hybridized to an
Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray
(Design ID: 028005). Microarrays were scanned and
the intensity values were quantified using Agilent
feature extraction software, which performs background
subtractions. Normalization was performed using Agilent
GeneSpring (per chip: normalization to 75 percentile shift;
per gene: normalization to the median of all samples). Data
analysis and visualization including hierarchical clustering
were carried out using TIBCO Spotfire (PerkinElmer).

Cells preparation and flow cytometric analysis
The spleens, livers, bone marrow (BM), thymuses,
ovaries, inguinal and axillary lymph nodes (LNs), and
ovaries were removed from Ht48 cell-recipient mice.
Monoculear cells (MNCs) were isolated from each
tissue using LymphoprepTM (Axis-Shield), then stained
with various antibodies (Supplemental Table 1) and with
propidium iodide (50 ng; eBioscience) to distinguish live
cells. For side population (SP) analysis, the MNCs were
incubated (1 h; 37 °C) with Hoechst33342 (5 µg/mL,
Dojindo) with or without verapamil (25 µg/mL, Teva).
Flowcytometric analyses and cell sorting with a J-SAN
(Bay bioscience) were performed.

To detect the target gene transcripts in Ht48 cells,
we performed flow-cytometric analyses combined with
in situ hybridization analyses by Primeflow RNA assays
(eBioscience) according to their protocols. For section
in situ hybridization, we used viewRNA™ (eBioscience)
according to their protocols. Target probes were designed
with Affymetrix (Supplemental Table 1).

Histological analysis

q-PCR analysis

Tissues were fixed with Bouin’s solution (SigmaAldrich) and then dehydrated using graded series of
ethanol and cleared with xylen. Tissues were embedded
in paraffin and sliced into approximately 4-µm-thick
sections. We performed Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS)
hematoxylin staining and immunohistochemistry

The primers for each target gene were designed with
Primer 3 Plus (Supplemental Table 2). Total RNA (50 ng)
was used for reverse transcription using SuperScriptIII
First-Standard Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Then, cDNA was amplified with SYBRPremix-ExTaqII (Takara-Bio) and analyzed by Applied
