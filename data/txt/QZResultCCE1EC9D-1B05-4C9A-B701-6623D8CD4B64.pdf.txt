expression and actions of CXCR4 in both neural and astrocytic
brain tumors and found that CXCR4 can stimulate tumor growth
and spread (11, 12, 14). We found that systemic delivery of AMD
3100, a small-molecule antagonist of ligand-induced activation
of CXCR4, blocked the i.c. growth of both glioblastoma and
medulloblastoma xenografts (12). These studies validated CXCR4
as a therapeutic target for the treatment of malignant brain
tumors, but they did not identify the critical intracellular events
that underlie CXCR4-dependent brain tumor growth, or the
intracellular pathways that are targeted by AMD 3100 action.
More recently, we developed a novel phospho-specific antibody
that recognizes a ligand-induced form of CXCR4 and showed that
increased grade of astrocytoma is associated with increased CXCR4
phosphorylation (13). Activation of CXCR4 would be predicted to
inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease intracellular levels of cAMP
(15). Thus, the association between increased tumor grade and
ligand-activation of CXCR4 could mechanistically link the earlier
observations that cAMP levels are negatively correlated with the
degree of malignancy in brain tumors.
Here, we report that cAMP suppression is key to CXCR4mediated brain tumor growth, and that the antitumor effect of the
CXCR4 antagonist AMD 3465 can be accounted for by its ability to
block CXCL12-induced cAMP suppression. Furthermore, this
antitumor effect is mimicked in vitro and in vivo by drugs that
elevate cAMP. These studies are the first to implicate cAMP
suppression as a critical growth-promoting event downstream of
CXCR4 activation. As such, they advance our efforts to improve
brain tumor therapy by identifying cAMP elevation as a novel
therapeutic strategy.

Abstract
The chemokine CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4
regulate malignant brain tumor growth and are potential
chemotherapeutic targets. However, the molecular basis for
CXCL12-induced tumor growth remains unclear, and the
optimal approach to inhibiting CXCR4 function in cancer is
unknown. To develop such a therapeutic approach, we
investigated the signaling pathways critical for CXCL12
function in normal and malignant cells. We discovered that
CXCL12-dependent tumor growth is dependent upon sustained inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, and that
the antitumor activity of the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD
3465 is associated with blocking cAMP suppression. Consistent with these findings, we show that pharmacologic
elevation of cAMP with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
Rolipram suppresses tumor cell growth in vitro and, upon
oral administration, inhibits intracranial growth in xenograft
models of malignant brain tumors with comparable efficacy to
AMD 3465. These data indicate that the clinical evaluation of
phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the treatment of patients with
brain tumors is warranted. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):651–8]

Introduction
Nearly 30 years ago, it was observed that higher grades of human
brain tumors were associated with lower total adenylyl cyclase
activity and decreased tumor cell cyclic AMP (cAMP; refs. 1, 2). It is
now known that increased cAMP inhibits proliferation under most
circumstances (3–6) and can also stimulate apoptosis (7–9). Thus,
these earlier observations warrant re-evaluation as we search for
therapeutic targets in our efforts to improve the outcome for
patients with malignant brain tumors.
Decreased adenylyl cyclase activity and decreased intracellular
cAMP could be the result of decreased adenylyl cyclase expression
or decreased adenylyl cyclase activation. With respect to the latter,
the expression of CXCR4 in malignant brain tumors is of particular
interest. CXCR4 is a Gai-coupled chemokine receptor and therefore
has the capacity to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and decrease
intracellular cAMP (10–13). We and others have studied the

Tumor cell lines. Firefly luciferase-expressing U87 glioblastoma multiforme cells and Daoy medulloblastoma cells were a gift of Dr. Andrew Kung
(Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).
Additional U87 and Daoy cells were obtained from the American Type
Tissue Culture (Manassas, VA). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)luciferase expressing U87 and Daoy cells were generated via lentiviral
infection with FUGW-FL as described (16, 17). Briefly, replication-deficient
virus was produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with three viral-encoding
plasmids using Fugene 6 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The plasmids were (a) an expression vector
containing transgenes for EGFP and firefly luciferase, (b) a plasmid
containing vesicular stomatitis virus coat protein for pseudotyping, and (c)
the D packaging vector. Viral particles were collected from 293T cell
supernatants and applied to tumor cell cultures. EGFP-expressing cells were
sorted and collected by high-speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

Cancer Research
Brain tumor cell cultures. Cells were cultured in aMEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FCS (Biomedia, Foster City, CA) in
the presence of penicillin/streptomycin at 37jC with 5% CO2.
Primary astrocyte cultures. Primary astrocytes were cultured from
1- to 3-day-old BALB/c mice as described (18). The cortices were triturated
into single cells in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10%
FCS and then plated onto poly-D-lysine coated 75-cm2 T flasks (0.5 cortical
hemisphere/flask) for 10 to 14 days. Astrocytes were purified by first
removing nonadherent cells through vigorous shaking of T flasks overnight
and then isolating the remaining adherent astrocytes with 0.1% trypsin.
Primary granule neuron cultures. Primary cultures of purified granule
precursor cells (GPCs) were prepared from 6-day-old BALB/c mice as
described (19). Cerebella were dissected, and meninges were removed.
After incubation with 0.1% trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in HBSS with
125 units/mL DNase (Sigma), 0.5 mmol/L EDTA for 20 min at 37jC, cells
were pelleted and washed thrice with HBSS. The final cell suspension was
passed through a 100-Am nylon mesh cell strainer (Falcon, Franklin Lakes,
NJ). Cells were diluted to 2  106 per mL in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with N2 (Life Technologies), 20 mmol/L
KCl, and 36 mmol/L glucose and plated onto poly-D-lysine (20 Ag/mL;
Sigma)–coated plates.
Growth factor and drug treatment. Following serum starvation for
24 h, astrocytes, granule cells, U87 cells, and Daoy cells were treated with
1 Ag/mL CXCL12 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 2.5 ng/mL AMD 3465 (kind gift
from Simon Fricker), 200 Amol/L rolipram (Sigma), or 10 Amol/L forskolin
(Sigma) as indicated. Daoy and U87 cell growth in culture was measured by
trypan blue exclusion after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively.

150 mg/kg and xylazine at 12 mg/kg (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, St. Joseph,
MO) via i.p. injection. The cranium was exposed, and a small hole was made
with a size 34 inverted cone burr (Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD). Mice were
fixed in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL), and 50,000 cells in
10 AL of PBS were injected through a 27-gauge needle over 2 min at 2 mm
lateral and posterior to the bregma and 3 mm below the dura. The incision
was closed with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN).

In vivo Drug Treatment
Mice were imaged at least twice after implantation of cells to identify
those with equivalent tumor growth rates. Two weeks after tumor cell
implantation, cohorts of mice with approximately equivalent tumor
bioluminescence were divided into equal control and treatment groups.
Animals in AMD 3465 experiments received s.c. osmotic pumps (Alzet,
Palo Alto, CA) loaded with 10 mg/mL AMD 3465 in sterile PBS or PBS
alone, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The infusion rate was
0.25 AL/h (50 Ag/d). For the experiments with rolipram or caffeine, mice
in the treatment groups received oral administration of rolipram (5 Ag/g/d)
or caffeine (100 Ag/g/d). The concentration of drug in the water was
determined from daily measurements of water consumption by each animal
over the course of 7 days. Concentrations were adjusted based on water
consumption to provide the prescribed dose.

Bioluminescence Imaging
For bioluminescence imaging of living animals, NCR nude mice bearing
i.c. xenografts of firefly luciferase–expressing U87 or Daoy cells were
injected i.p. with 150 Ag/g D-luciferin (Biosynth, Naperville, IL) in PBS,
anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, and imaged with a charge-coupled device
camera-based bioluminescence imaging system (IVIS 50; Xenogen Corp.,
Alameda, CA; exposure time = 1-60 s, binning = 8, field of view = 12,
f/stop = 1, open filter). Signals were displayed as photons/s/cm2/sr (20).
Regions of interest were defined manually at 95% of the maximum pixel
output using Living Image and IgorPro Software (version 2.50), and data
were expressed as total photon flux (photons per second; ref. 20). Generally,
the first mouse images were obtained 24 h following i.c. inoculation of
tumor cells. Data were analyzed and plotted as the ratio of bioluminescence
on a given treatment day over bioluminescence on the first day.

Phosphodiesterase 4A Expression
U87 and Daoy cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding
a transgene for the tet-off transactivator alone (kind gift from Dr. Louis
Muglia, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO), a
plasmid containing a transgene for tet-off regulated expression of
phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A) alone (kind gift from Dr. James Cherry,
Boston University, Boston, MA), or a combination of both plasmids, using
LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmid DNA (2 Ag) was mixed with LipofectAMINE (5 AL) per 35-mm2
dish. Transfection proceeded for 6 h before exchanging transfection media
for aMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.

Immunohistochemistry
Human brain tumor tissue was retrieved from the pathology files at
Washington University School of Medicine. Samples were used in
accordance with an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol for
human research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was processed
and analyzed as described (13). CXCR4 was detected with a mouse
monoclonal antibody (1 Ag/mL; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and
CXCL12 was localized with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:66 dilution;
Peprotech). Phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) was detected using our rabbit
polyclonal antibody (1:66 dilution). Immunoreactive complexes were
detected using the corresponding secondary biotin-conjugated antibodies
augmented by streptavidin/horseradish peroxide and visualized by 3,3¶diaminobenzidine supplied by DAKO (Carpinteria, CA).

cAMP Measurement
Cell culture. U87 or Daoy cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated
with CXCL12 (1 Ag/mL), rolipram (200 Amol/L), AMD 3465 (2.5 ng/mL), or
forskolin (10 Amol/L). Cells were lysed in 0.1 mol/L HCl, and particulate
matter was removed by centrifugation at >600  g for 10 min. The
supernatants were dried down and resuspended in cAMP assay buffer
(Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI).
Tumor tissue. EGFP-expressing tumor tissue was removed under direct
fluorescence microscopy and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was
weighed and homogenized with 10 volumes of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic
acid and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 rpm to remove precipitate. The
supernatant was washed thrice with 8 volumes of water-saturated ether.
The aqueous phase was dried down and resuspended in cAMP assay buffer.
Determination of cAMP concentration. Competitive immunoassay for
cAMP concentration was done using a Correlated-EIA Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Assay Designs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, absorbance at 405 nm was measured, and cAMP concentrations
were determined by calculation based on a standard curve. Protein
concentrations were measured by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s directions. cAMP values were
normalized to protein for each sample individually. To facilitate comparisons between cell types and experiments, all cAMP data have been
normalized to control values in each experiment.

Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis for protein expression was done by standard procedures exactly as described previously (13). Membranes were incubated with
the following polyclonal antibodies: phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (pErk1/2; 1:1,000), pan Erk1/2 (1:5,000), phosphorylated
Akt (pAkt; 1:1,0000), pan Akt (1:5,000), and PDE4 (1:1,000) overnight at 4jC.
All blots were stripped and reprobed with antibody directed against h-actin
(1:5,000). This was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (1:15,000; Bio-Rad). All primary antibodies
were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) except antibody to PDE4A (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) and h-actin (Sigma). Quantitation of Western blots was done
by densitometry using ImageJ software from the NIH.

CXCR4-Dependent cAMP Suppression in Brain Tumors

with increased phosphorylation of CXCR4 (13). To determine
whether this might be a general feature of central nervous system
malignancies, we did a similar analysis of CXCR4 phosphorylation
in the primitive neural tumor, medulloblastoma. We evaluated a
total of 10 pediatric and adult cases comprising the three major
histologic variants of medulloblastoma: desmoplastic, classic, and
anaplastic/large cell (21). In agreement with our previous studies of
medulloblastoma and glioblastoma (12, 13), all specimens exhibited
positive tumor cell staining for CXCR4 (data not shown) and
endothelial cell staining for CXCL12 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The
presence of both CXCL12 and CXCR4 in tumor specimens was
associated with the phosphorylation of CXCR4 (pCXCR4) in 5 of
10 cases (Supplementary Fig. S1B; Supplementary Table S1). None
of the desmoplastic medulloblastomas contained pCXCR4, whereas
two of three classic and three of the four anaplastic large
cell specimens did (Supplementary Table S1). Compared with the
classic examples, desmoplastic medulloblastomas are associated
with a slightly better clinical course, whereas anaplastic/large cell
medulloblastomas are considerably more aggressive (21). In this
small series, the differences in subtype-specific pCXCR4 staining
did not reach statistical significance, but the trend suggests that the
level of pCXCR4 may correlate with aggressiveness in medulloblastoma.
CXCL12 growth effects are associated with sustained
suppression of cAMP. We investigated whether CXCR4 activation
was associated with decreased intracellular cAMP in brain tumor
cells, and whether there was enhanced CXCL12-induced cAMP
suppression in these neoplastic cells compared with normal cells.
To model tumor cell responses, we used U87 glioblastoma and
Daoy medulloblastoma cell cultures. Although the true cell of
origin for glioblastoma and medulloblastoma is still controversial
(22), we used primary cultures of cortical astrocytes and cerebellar
GPCs as normal counterparts for glioblastoma and medulloblastoma, respectively (23). When we measured time-dependent
changes in intracellular cAMP after application of 1 Ag/mL of
CXCL12, we found that astrocytic cAMP fluctuated between
baseline and 40% of baseline (Fig. 1A), whereas in GPCs, there
was little to no change in cAMP levels (Fig. 1B). The cAMP
response in tumor cells was markedly different. cAMP levels rapidly
declined in both U87 (Fig. 1A) and Daoy (Fig. 1B) cells and
remained suppressed throughout the experimental period. Areaunder-the-curve measurements indicated that in U87 cells, there
was a 45% reduction in intracellular cAMP compared with
astrocytes (Fig. 1A), whereas in Daoy cells, cAMP was reduced by
70% compared with GPCs (Fig. 1B).
Differences in cAMP suppression were correlated with differences in CXCL12 growth effects. Although CXCL12 (1 Ag/mL)
increased U87 (Fig. 1A) and Daoy cell (Fig. 1B) number by >200%,
it tended to decrease astrocyte cell number (Fig. 1A) and had no
effect on GPC cell number (Fig. 1B). In both comparisons, sustained cAMP suppression was correlated with tumor cell growth.
This suggested that sustained suppression of cAMP might be a key
growth-promoting signal downstream of CXCR4 activation.
CXCL12 growth effects are blocked by elevation of intracellular cAMP. To further evaluate cAMP suppression as the basis for
CXCR4-mediated tumor growth, we assessed the ability of drugs
that elevate cAMP to block CXCL12-induced growth. cAMP
elevation can be pharmacologically achieved by either stimulating
adenylyl cyclase or inhibiting cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases.
Among the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases, PDE4 was found
to be the predominant isoform in approximately two thirds of

60 human tumor cell lines (24). PDE4 is highly expressed in the
brain (25) and can be specifically inhibited by rolipram. Rolipram is
a particularly attractive agent for our purposes as it has been
extensively evaluated in human clinical trials as an antidepressant
and as an anti-inflammatory agent, including for inflammatory
states of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis
(26, 27). Thus, in the following studies, we evaluated the effects of
adenylyl cyclase activation with forskolin and PDE4 inhibition with
rolipram on CXCL12-induced growth responses.
CXCL12 was again observed to increase U87 and Daoy cell
number by >2-fold (Fig. 2A). Treatment with rolipram had little to
no effect on U87 or Daoy cell number alone but completely blocked
the growth effects of CXCL12. Forskolin also blocked CXCL12
growth effects in both cell lines but, in addition, was observed to
inhibit U87 and Daoy cell growth on its own (Fig. 2B). A difference
between rolipram and forskolin was also observed for their effects
on cAMP. Both drugs blocked CXCL12-induced suppression of
cAMP, but only forskolin produced significant increases in cAMP
levels (Fig. 2C).
AMD 3465 blocks in vivo and in vitro tumor growth and
prevents CXCL12-induced cAMP suppression. We hypothesized
that if suppression of cAMP is a key growth-promoting signal
downstream of CXCR4 activation, then CXCR4 antagonists must
block this suppression. Previously, we evaluated the in vitro and
in vivo antitumor activity of the bicyclam antagonist of CXCR4
activation, AMD 3100 (12). This drug, which functions as a
competitive antagonist of CXCL12 binding (28, 29) with partial
agonist properties (30, 31), exhibited significant antitumor activity
both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated a newer
generation competitive antagonist, AMD 3465. This is a monocyclam with greater affinity for CXCR4 and greater solubility in
water (32). CXCL12 again increased U87 and Daoy cell number by

medulloblastoma typically possess multiple genetic abnormalities
that constitutively drive proliferation and survival pathways when
assayed in vitro (21, 33). We sought to determine which intracellular pathways downstream of CXCR4 activation were most
critical to its tumor growth effects. To do this, we investigated
which pathways were both activated by CXCL12 and blocked by
cotreatment with CXCL12 and AMD 3465, in a manner that
correlated with effects on growth. Activation of Erk1/2 and Akt
have been implicated in the stimulation of both astrocytoma (34)
and medulloblastoma (35, 36) growth. Therefore, we examined
Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in Daoy and U87 cells in response
to CXCL12 and AMD 3465.
Both CXCL12 and AMD 3465 treatment stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in U87 and Daoy cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although AMD 3465 was less potent than CXCL12,
these observations still suggest that similar to AMD 3100, AMD
3465 possesses partial agonist activity. Contrary to our observations with AMD 3100 (12), cotreatment of Daoy and U87 cells with
CXCL12 and AMD 3465 was also associated with the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. This was particularly striking in the treatment of
U87 cells, where cotreatment resulted in a significant increase in
Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Neither U87 nor Daoy cells exhibited large
increases in Akt phosphorylation in response to CXCL12, AMD
3465, or the two compounds together (Fig. 3; Supplementary
Fig. S3). Thus, Erk1/2 is activated under conditions that stimulate
growth (CXCL12 alone) and conditions that do not stimulate
growth (AMD 3465 alone and cotreatment with CXCL12 and AMD
3465). Together, these data suggest that the activation of Erk1/2
and Akt are not clearly correlated with the growth effects of
CXCL12 or the growth-inhibitory effects of AMD 3465.
A clearer relationship between growth and signaling activity was
evident, however, in the effects of CXCL12 and AMD 3465 on cAMP

>200% (Supplementary Fig. S2A). AMD 3465 had no significant
effect on cell number alone but completely blocked CXCL12induced growth in both cell lines.
Similar to studies with AMD 3100 (12), treatment of i.c. xenograft
models of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma with AMD 3465
indicated that CXCR4 activation is important to tumor growth
in vivo. I.c. xenografts of firefly luciferase expressing U87 or Daoy
cells were established as described in Materials and Methods.
Tumor bearing animals were treated with either continuous
s.c. infusion of PBS (control) or AMD 3465 at a dose of 50 Ag/d
(2.5 mg/kg/d) for 5 weeks. Bioluminescence imaging, which had
previously been determined to provide a measure that was linearly
related to tumor volume (12), was done weekly, and the means of
three separate experiments with five animals per treatment group
per experiment were analyzed for antitumor effect. Similar to what
we observed for AMD 3100 treatment, AMD 3465 significantly
blocked i.c. xenograft growth (Supplementary Fig. S2B). U87 GBM
xenografts were inhibited by 80%, and Daoy xenografts were
inhibited by 85%, compared with controls.

is not apparent from the above experiments. Glioblastoma and

CXCR4-Dependent cAMP Suppression in Brain Tumors

suppression. As described above, CXCL12 induced rapid declines in
cAMP in both cell lines (Fig. 3B). AMD 3465 alone had differing
effects on U87 and Daoy cells. In U87 cells, there was a trend
towards a decrease, whereas in Daoy cells, there was a trend
towards an increase, in cAMP in response to AMD 3465. In neither
case did these changes reach statistical difference compared with
controls. When CXCL12 and AMD 3465 were co-administered, the
CXCL12-induced suppression of cAMP was blocked. Thus, cAMP
was only significantly suppressed under conditions that stimulated
growth (CXCL12 alone). These data support the hypothesis that the
suppression of cAMP is a key growth-promoting signal downstream of CXCR4 activation, and that the antitumor effect of AMD
3465 is uniquely dependent upon its ability to block this aspect of
CXCR4 signaling.
To confirm that cAMP suppression was a critical downstream
event in CXCR4-mediated growth, we transfected U87 (Fig. 4A) and
Daoy (Fig. 4B) cells with a plasmid encoding PDE4A under the
control of a tet-off regulatory element alone, or together with a
plasmid encoding the tet transactivator. Thus, in the absence of
doxycycline, transactivation results in exogenous PDE4A expression and decreases in intracellular cAMP. If suppression of cAMP is
a critical growth-promoting event downstream of CXCR4 activation, then expression of PDE4 should mimic the activity of CXCL12.
PDE4A expression driven by the transactivator resulted in an
increase in PDE4A expression and a decline in intracellular cAMP
in both U87 and Daoy cells (Fig. 4). This decrease in intracellular
cAMP was associated with an increase in cell growth in culture. In
both cell lines, increased phosphodiesterase expression and
decreased cAMP was associated with increases in cell number
that were comparable with the effect of CXCL12 alone. Under these
conditions, there was no additional, significant effect of CXCL12 on
cell number or cAMP levels, compared with controls. Moreover,
AMD 3465 had no effect on cell number alone or in combination
with CXCL12. In contrast, rolipram continued to exert a growthinhibitory effect. These data further support the hypothesis that the
primary growth-promoting activity of CXCL12 is the reduction of
intracellular cAMP, and that cAMP suppression is downstream of
CXCR4 activation.
Rolipram exhibits significant antitumor activity in i.c.
xenograft models of malignant brain tumors. Given the in vitro
activity of rolipram, we hypothesized that it would exhibit
significant antitumor activity in vivo. Cohorts of animals with
intracranial implants of luciferase-expressing U87 or Daoy xenografts were generated as described in Materials and Methods and
treated, beginning 2 weeks after tumor cell injection, with rolipram
(5 Ag/g/d) delivered in the drinking water versus water alone.
Treated animals seemed well throughout the treatment period.
Records of individual animal weights indicated that weights were
better maintained in the treatment compared with the control
group (data not shown). Bioluminescence imaging was done weekly,
and the means of three separate experiments with five animals per
treatment group per experiment were analyzed for antitumor
effects (Fig. 5A). Rolipram exhibited significant antitumor activity in
both tumor models. Rolipram inhibited U87 xenograft growth by
96% (Fig. 5B). This exceeded the growth-inhibitory effect of the
CXCR4 antagonist AMD 3465 in the same xenograft system (compare
Fig. 5B with Supplementary Fig. S2B). The effect of rolipram on Daoy
xenografts was smaller, producing only a 58% inhibition of growth, a
value comparable with the activity of AMD 3465. To assess whether
other phosphodiesterase inhibitors might possess similar antitumor
activity, we treated i.c. Daoy xenografts with the nonspecific

U87 (A) and Daoy (B) cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding PDE4A
under control of a tet-off regulatory element (control) or cotransfected with the
plasmids encoding PDE4A and the tet-off transactivator (PDE4A expressing).
Cotransfection resulted in an increase in PDE4A expression as determined by
Western blot analysis. Actin serves as loading control. Cultures were treated with
CXCL12 (1 Ag/mL), AMD 3465 (2.5 ng/mL), and rolipram (200 Amol/L) as
indicated. cAMP was measured by ELISA, and viable cell number was
determined by trypan blue exclusion. Columns, means of cell counts and

phosphodiesterase inhibitor caffeine (100 Ag/g/d). We observed an
85% reduction in tumor growth, an antitumor effect that was greater
than rolipram or AMD 3465 (Fig. 5C).
To ascertain whether the in vivo antitumor effects of rolipram
and AMD 3465 were correlated with increases in intratumoral
cAMP, we repeated the treatment paradigms with Daoy xenografts
that had been engineered to express both EGFP and firefly
luciferase. This was done to enable the re-isolation of tumor tissue
for extraction of cAMP. After 5 weeks of treatment, tumor tissue
was easily visualized in situ under direct fluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 6A). cAMP was extracted from GFP-positive tissue, and cAMP
levels were measured by ELISA. The antitumor activity of rolipram
and AMD 3465 was associated with a small but significant increase
in the amount of cAMP within tumor tissue (Fig. 6B). Together,
these data strongly support the hypothesis that cAMP suppression
is a key growth-promoting event downstream of CXCR4 activation,
and that that elevation of tumor cell cAMP has significant antibrain tumor effect.

Discussion
The expression of pCXCR4 in human brain tumors and the potent
anti-xenograft activity of AMD 3100 and AMD 3465 place CXCR4
among the few validated targets for molecular therapy of malignant brain tumors. For CXCR4, epidermal growth factor receptor
(37), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (38), and mammalian
target of rapamycin (39), abnormal levels of activation are
correlated with malignant growth, and correction of this activity
in the experimental setting can abrogate growth dysregulation (40).

against phosphodiesterase-overexpressing tumor cells further
confirms the importance of cAMP to growth regulation, consistent
with earlier studies that suggested brain tumor grade was inversely
related to adenylyl cyclase activity and intracellular levels of cAMP
(1, 2).
In our prior studies, the magnitude of the antitumor effect of
the CXCR4 antagonist AMD 3100 was best correlated with its
proapoptotic activity (12). Thus, it will be important to identify
cAMP-regulated mediators of survival. Targeting cAMP and/or
these downstream targets of cAMP might allow for greater
specificity in cancer treatment. The role of CXCR4 in maintaining
stem cell pools in the bone marrow (42, 44, 45) and in regulating
lymphocyte trafficking (46) is dependent upon CXCR4-mediated
chemotactic effects. This has previously been shown to be a
function of CXCR4-mediated activation of Erk1/2 (47), p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (48), and Akt (49). There are no
observations to suggest that cAMP suppression is necessary for
CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. This might therefore provide a
differential target by which the disruption of CXCR4-mediated
survival would not interfere with CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis.
The smaller effect of rolipram on Daoy compared with U87
xenografts may be due to the presence of cAMP-independent
growth-promoting pathways downstream of CXCR4 in Daoy cells,
or there being resistance mechanisms to rolipram in Daoy cells.
cAMP levels are tightly regulated and sustained elevations, like
those that arise with phosphodiesterase inhibition, can induce
regulatory pathways that restore cAMP to baseline levels. This
commonly involves transcriptional regulation of phosphodiesterase
expression (50). Alternate phosphodiesterase expression as the
basis for the smaller response of Daoy cells to rolipram was
supported by the activity of caffeine, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
The significance of identifying cAMP suppression as the mediator of CXCR4 growth effects and rolipram as an antitumor agent
lies in the clinical applicability of PDE4 inhibitors. This class of
drugs, including, theophylline, AirFlo, and roflumilast, have
established applications in the treatment of asthma and chronic

The appropriate therapeutic approach for antagonizing CXCR4
remains unclear. Single doses of AMD 3100 have proven useful for
the mobilization of bone marrow stem cells before autologous
bone marrow transplant (41, 42). Sustained dosing of AMD 3100
over a 10-day period, however, was associated with mild toxicities,
and reflective of its effects on bone marrow function, elevations of
WBC counts were evident throughout an 18-day follow-up period
after cessation of AMD 3100 (43). Whether these toxicities and
sustained effects on marrow function would preclude the prolonged delivery of AMD 3100, related analogues, or other CXCR4
antagonists to cancer patients is not known, but the necessity for
continued evaluation of this pathway and alternative antagonist
approaches is clear.
CXCR4 is a Gi-coupled GPCR, and, in these experiments, the
suppression of intracellular cAMP seemed to be the key event in
mediating CXCR4-dependent growth effects. This was apparent in
the differences between CXCL12-induced cAMP suppression and
growth in U87 cells compared with astrocytes and Daoy cells
compared with GPCs. The importance of cAMP suppression to
growth was also evident in the ability of adenylyl cyclase activation
with forskolin and PDE4 inhibition with rolipram to elevate
intracellular cAMP and block CXCL12-induced tumor cell growth.
The ability of PDE4A overexpression to drive increased growth in
a manner that was no longer regulated by CXCL12 and no longer
sensitive to AMD 3465 places cAMP suppression downstream of
CXCR4 activation in stimulating tumor cell growth. Moreover,
the induction of Erk1/2 phosphorylation upon cotreatment of
tumor cells with CXCL12 and AMD 3465 indicates that cAMP
suppression, and not Erk1/2 phosphorylation, is correlated with
CXCL12 growth effects. The preserved antitumor effect of rolipram

CXCR4-Dependent cAMP Suppression in Brain Tumors

The importance of targeting CXCR4 in the treatment of brain
and other cancers is clear. However, the optimal mode of CXCR4
antagonism is not yet known. These studies suggest that targeting the downstream suppression of cAMP may be efficacious
and tractable. The clinical availability of drugs that elevate cAMP
and will cross the blood-brain barrier makes this an especially
attractive treatment approach.

obstructive pulmonary disease (51) and as anti-inflammatory
agents (27). Rolipram was originally developed as an antidepressant and antidementia medication (26). It crosses an intact bloodbrain barrier and may therefore have an additional advantage in
the treatment of brain tumors. The potential for resistance might
be addressed through the use of combined PDE3 and PDE4A
inhibitors, such as zardaverine. Although caffeine exhibited
significant anti-xenograft activity and has been shown to enhance
cytotoxicity in vitro (52), it is less likely to be useful as a clinical
agent in the treatment of brain tumors. Addition of pentoxiphyllin,
a methylxanthine related to caffeine, to chemotherapy and radiation therapy for patients with malignant gliomas was evaluated in
a clinical trial that was terminated due to excessive toxicity,
including decreased consciousness and increased seizure activity
(53). Therefore, renewed evaluation of specific phosphodiesterase
inhibitors, like rolipram, for the treatment of brain and other
cancers is warranted.
