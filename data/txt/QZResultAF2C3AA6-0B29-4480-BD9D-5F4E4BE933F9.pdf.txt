BACKGROUND: Although rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has substantially improved clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), only 40% to 50% of patients achieve a complete remission (CR). There remains interest in identifying new
approaches to improve the effectiveness of CIT. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with greater apparent
single-agent activity than rituximab in CLL patients. METHODS: Previously untreated CLL patients in need of therapy received 6
cycles of CIT induction with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and ofatumumab (PCO) followed by response assessment. RESULTS: Of
the 48 patients enrolled, 77% completed PCO induction. Adverse events during induction included grade 31 hematologic toxicity
(27%) and grade 31 nonhematologic toxicity (23%). Median CD4 count after induction and 6 months later were 186 3 106/L and
272 3 106/L. The overall response rate was 96% (46 of 48 patients), and the CR rate was 46% (22 of 48 patients). Among the 38
patients who underwent minimal residual disease evaluation, 7 (18%) were negative for minimal residual disease. After median followup of 24 months, 10 (21%) patients have progressed and 8 (17%) have required retreatment. The efficacy and toxicity of ofatumumabbased CIT compare favorably to our historical trials of rituximab-based CIT using an identical chemotherapy backbone (n 5 64). Time
to retreatment also appeared longer for ofatumumab-based CIT (free of retreatment at 24 months: 86% [95% confidence interval 5 75-99] versus 68% [95% confidence interval 5 56-81] for rituximab-based CIT). CONCLUSIONS: Ofatumumab-based CIT is well
tolerated in patients with previously untreated CLL. The efficacy of ofatumumab-based CIT compares favorably to historical trials of
rituximab-based CIT, suggesting randomized trials comparing ofatumumab-based CIT and rituximab-based CIT should be considered.

INTRODUCTION
The last decade has been a time of tremendous progress in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Phase 3
trials conducted in the 1990s established that fludarabine-based therapy offered superior response rates and progressionfree survival compared with alkylating agent-based therapy.1-3 Randomized controlled trials subsequently demonstrated
that the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) further improved response rates and progression-free
survival.4-6 These advances were followed by the development of chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) combining anti-CD20
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with purine nucleoside analogues. A seminal phase 3 trial conducted by the German CLL
Study Group demonstrated that the addition of the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab to the FC platform (FCR) improved not
only response rates and progression-free survival but also overall survival.7 Unlike previous treatment approaches, a large
proportion of patients treated with CIT have no detectable disease at the completion of induction therapy even when evaluated using highly sensitive assays (minimal residual disease [MRD] negativity). MRD status at the completion of therapy
has been found to be a strong predictor of both progression-free and overall survival.8
Despite these advances, only 45% of patients achieve a complete remission with CIT such as FCR, and nearly all
patients eventually relapse.7 Furthermore, FCR showed considerable hematologic toxicity, particularly among patients
greater than age 70 years.9 These facts have generated interest in strategies to improve both the efficacy and tolerability of
CIT. All initial CIT trials for CLL employed rituximab as the anti-CD20 mAb. Rituximab is a chimeric mAb with a
human constant region and a murine variable region which appears to mediate its effects in CLL primarily through

antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
rather than through either complement fixation or direct
induction of apoptosis. In efforts to improve clinical efficacy, more recently developed anti-CD20 mAbs have
been engineered to invoke greater ADCC, induce direct
cell death, or promote complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20
mAb with clinical activity as a single agent in patients with
fludarabine-refractory CLL.10 Ofatumumab binds to
both the small and large loop domains of CD20 at an epitope distinct from rituximab and is more efficient at
inducing CDC with similar cell-mediated cytotoxicity.11
Ofatumumab appears to have greater single-agent clinical
activity than rituximab10,12,13 in patients with previously
treated CLL and also has activity in rituximab-refractory
patients.14 Given these distinct characteristics of ofatumumab, we conducted a trial of ofatumumab-based CIT for
patients with previously untreated CLL and compared the
results to our historical trials of rituximab-based CIT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

Eligible patients were required to have a diagnosis of progressive CLL in need of treatment according to the
National Cancer Institute/International Workshop on
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (NCI/IWCLL) Working Group criteria.15 Patients had to be previously
untreated, have an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2,
and have adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients
with recent (< 1 month) myocardial infarction, class III
or IV heart failure, uncontrolled infection, infection with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B
or C infection, or active hemolytic anemia were excluded.
Patients with other malignancies were allowed to participate, provided they were not receiving treatment and had
a life expectancy > 2 years. There was no upper age limit
on eligibility. The protocol was reviewed and approved by
both the Mayo Clinic and Duke University institutional
review boards and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov
(identifier NCT01024010).
Treatment Plan

After giving written informed consent, eligible patients
with CLL received 6 cycles of induction CIT using pentostatin (2 mg/m2 on day 1), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/
m2 on day 1), and ofatumumab (cycle 1: 300 mg on day
1, 1000 mg/m2 on day 2; cycles 2-6: 1000 mg/m2 on day
1) given intravenously every 21 days. Methylprednisolone
80 mg (or equivalent) was administered intravenously
prior to each dose of ofatumumab.

Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim or alternative) and herpes zoster
(valacyclovir or alternative) were given to all patients for 1
year from the start of cycle 1. All patients were given allopurinol (300 mg orally once daily) on days 1 through 14
of cycle 1. Pegfilgrastim was administered on day 2 of
each cycle.
Patients completing 6 cycles of PCO induction
underwent complete restaging including evaluation for
MRD using flow cytometry (assay sensitivity to at least
1024 [< 0.01%]).16 Restaging occurred 12 weeks after
day 1 of cycle 6. MRD assays after induction were preferentially performed on bone marrow aspirate (n 5 36)
with use of peripheral blood if bone marrow aspirate was
not available (n 5 2).
Dose Modifications for Toxicity

Platelet and hemoglobin adverse events were graded
according to the IWCLL CLL Working Group grading
scale for hematologic toxicity.15 All other adverse events
were graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4).
Criteria for Response

Responses were graded according to the NCI/IWCLL
Working Group criteria.15 Bone marrow biopsies were
performed at registration and the response evaluation following PCO induction to document complete response.
Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in all patients at registration and at the response evaluation following PCO
induction.
Quantification of T Cell Numbers and
Immunoglobulin G Levels at Baseline and
During Treatment

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and the absolute number
of CD41 and CD81 T cells were measured using routine
clinical assays.
Statistical Methods

A 1-stage binomial design was used in this phase 2 trial.
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who
achieved a complete response (CR). The study was initially designed to accrue a total of 30 evaluable patients to
test the null hypothesis that the true CR rate is at most
25% versus the alternative hypothesis that it is at least
50%. The study had 90% power, with a 5% type I error
rate. The sample size was later increased to 48 patients. A
patient was considered evaluable for response if they were
eligible and initiated treatment. The proportion of CRs
3789

Original Article

was estimated by the number of patients who achieved a
CR divided by the total number of evaluable patients.
Time to retreatment (TTR) was defined as the time from
registration to initiation of subsequent treatment for
CLL. The distribution of time to retreatment was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Laboratory values
measured on a continuous scale (eg, IgG levels, T-cell
counts) were compared between paired sample time
points using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinical characteristics and prognostic factors were compared to a historical cohort using Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon’s
rank-sum test for categorical and continuous factors,
respectively.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Response to
Induction

Forty-eight patients were enrolled between March 2010
and March 2011, all of whom were eligible for treatment.
The median age was 65 years (range, 50-83 years) and
71% of patients were male (Table 1); 35% of patients had
intermediate Rai risk and 65% high Rai risk. On prognostic testing, 48% CD381, 48% were ZAP-701, and 48%
were IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy variable cluster)
unmutated (um). Chromosomal analysis by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) found that 69%,10%, and
4% of patients had 1, 2, or 3 FISH defects, respectively.
FISH risk category using the classification of Dohner et
al17 is shown in Table 1.
Toxicity and Tolerability

All patients have completed active treatment. Patients
received a median of 6 cycles (range, 2-6 cycles) with 37
of 48 (77%) patients completing the intended 6 cycles of
therapy. Eleven patients discontinued therapy early due to
adverse events/complications (9 patients), disease progression (1 patient), and death while on study (1 patient). The
adverse events/complications necessitating discontinuation of treatment included rash (2 patients), autoimmune
hemolytic anemia (2 patients), decline in functional status
(1 patient), infection (1 patient), anorexia/fatigue (2
patients), and repeated hospitalizations (1 patient). While
receiving treatment, 12 of 48 (25%) patients experienced
a dose delay and 2 of 48 (4%) required dose reductions.
Adverse events deemed at least possibly related to PCO
are shown in Table 2 and included 13 (27%) patients
with grade 31 hematologic toxicity and 11 (23%) with
grade 31 nonhematologic toxicity. The most common
grade 3 or 4 toxicity was neutropenia, which occurred in
11 (23%) patients. Four (8%) patients experienced grade

Among 29 patients with CD4 cell counts measured 6
months after the completion of induction, 19 of 29
patients (66%) had a CD4 count > 200 3 106/L (median, 272 3 106/L).
Response to Therapy

All patients were evaluable for response. The overall
response rate (ORR) to PCO by the IWCLL criteria15
was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 86%-99%)
with 22 (46%) CR/CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), 3 (6%) complete clinical response (CCR;
who went off study early and did not have bone biopsy
performed), and 21 (44%) partial remission (PR;
including 14 [29%] nodular PR [nPR]). Among the 2
patients with deletion 17p13, 1 patient had PR and 1
patient had no response. Thirty-eight of 46 (83%)
responding patients underwent evaluation for MRD by
sensitive flow cytometry. Among these, 7 of 38 (18%)
were MRD-negative, including 5 of 19 (26%) patients
with CR/CRi who underwent MRD evaluation of the
bone marrow.
After treatment, 10 of 39 (26%) patients who had
no palpable lymphadenopathy or organomegaly and who
underwent CT scan had residual lymphadenopathy
(defined as > 1.5 cm) or organomegaly as determined by
imaging. Considering the results of CT scan in response
assessment would reclassify 6 of 22 (27%) patients with
CR/CRi to PR, including 1 of 5 patients with MRDnegative CR by conventional criteria.15 CT scan findings
would also reclassify 2 of 14 patients with nPR (a subcategory of PR) to standard PR.
As of last follow-up, 10 patients have progressed and
5 patients have died. No patients were lost to follow-up.
Deaths were due to disease progression (n 5 2), pneumonia (n 5 1), respiratory failure (n 5 1), and unknown
cause (n 5 1). The median follow-up of living patients is
24 months (range, 15-34 months). To date, 8 of the 46
(17%) responding patients have developed disease progression, and 6 (13%) have required retreatment. Median
TTR has not yet been reached (NR) (95% CI 5 30
months to NR). The median TTR for all patients is
shown in Figure 2.
Comparison of response was performed by IGHV
mutation, CD38, CD49d, and ZAP-70 status as well as
by the results of FISH analysis (high risk: del[17p13.1] or
del[11q22.3]; low risk/intermediate risk: del[13q13], trisomy 12, or negative). Depth of response (CR/CRi versus
CCR/nPR/PR) was not correlated with any pretreatment
prognostic factor.

Comparison to Historical Cohort of RituximabBased CIT

Finally, we compared this cohort of patients treated with
ofatumumab-based CIT to our prior cohort of patients
treated with rituximab-based CIT using an identical
chemotherapy backbone (pentostatin and cyclophosphamide). It should be emphasized that this analysis represents a comparison of patients treated on sequential phase
2 trials rather than being a randomized comparison.
Nonetheless, the eligibility criteria were nearly identical
between the trials, and the majority of patients accrued at
the same academic center. To compare toxicity and
response of ofatumumab-based CIT to rituximab-based
CIT, the 48 patients in the current study were compared
to 108 patients treated with PCR (pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) induction18 (before any consolidation19 was administered). To compare the TTR, all
patients in the current trial were compared to all 64
patients in the original PCR trial. Patients in our trial of
PCR followed by lenalidomide consolidation were not
included in the TTR analysis because they received consolidation therapy.
The clinical characteristics and prognostic profile of
patients treated with ofatumumab-based CIT and
rituximab-based CIT are shown in Table 3. The age, sex,
absolute lymphocyte count, beta-2-microglobulin levels,
ZAP-70 status, and FISH profile of treated patients were
similar (all P > .05). The ofatumumab cohort included
more advanced stage patients (Rai stage III/IV: 65% versus 47%; P 5 .06) and could be considered slightly higher
risk on that basis. Although not statistically significant,
the ofatumumab cohort also had a slightly higher rate of

With respect to hematologic toxicity during treatment, ofatumumab-based CIT compared favorably to our
previous experience with rituximab-based CIT ( grade 3

versus rituximab-CIT 5 41% [44 of 108], P 5 .11).

was observed during treatment ( grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity ofatumumab-CIT 5 19% [9 of 48] versus

higher proportion of Rai stage III/IV patients in the ofatumumab cohort, the efficacy of ofatumumab-based CIT
also compared favorably to our previous experience with

ofatumumab-CIT persisted on this subanalysis of IGHV
UM patients (CR rate ofatumumab-CIT: 52% [12 of
23]; CR rate rituximab-CIT 5 38% [25 of 66]).
With the caveat that it represents a comparison
across sequential phase 2 trials, the proportion of patients
free of retreatment at 24 months was 86% (95%
CI 5 75%-99%) for ofatumumab-based CIT versus 68%
(95% CI 5 56%-81%) for rituximab-based CIT (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Although the addition of the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab
to purine analogue-based chemotherapy improves overall
survival in patients with CLL,7 it remains a noncurative
treatment strategy. The considerable single-agent activity
of ofatumumab and its ability to promote CDC has raised
hope that ofatumumab-based CIT may improve efficacy.
In the present study, ofatumumab-based CIT was well
tolerated and had high ORR and CR rates. The 23%
prevalence of grade 31 neutropenia compares favorably
to our previous experience with rituximab-based CIT
(34%),18,19 using the same pentostatin and cyclophosphamide platform, as well as with prior studies of FCR CIT
which have reported grade 31 neutropenia in 34% of
patients.7 MRD-negative remissions in the bone marrow
were achieved in 7 patients (18% of those tested).
Although this rate of MRD-negative remissions in the
bone marrow appears lower than the 44% reported with
FCR,8 the 2-year freedom from retreatment (86%) compares favorably to the 80% level observed in historical
studies of FCR7 and the 70% level reported in studies of
fludarabine and rituximab (FR).20,21

was 35% for dose level 1 and a striking 60% for dose level
2 (the ofatumumab dose used in our study).22 Even
though the median age in the FCO trial was nearly a decade younger (median age, 56 years) than the patients in
our study, only 64% of FCO-treated patients completed
the intended 6 cycles of therapy (57% of patients on dose
level 2) with prolonged cytopenias the primary reason for
patients to withdraw. The ORRs observed with the FCO
combination22 were disappointing (ORR dose level 1:
77%; ORR dose level 2: 73%) relative to historical trials
of rituximab-based CIT using the fludarabine, cyclophos3794

phamide (FC) platform7,23 but increased to 90% range
when patients who experienced CR with incomplete marrow recovery were considered.15 The CR rates observed
with FCO (dose level 1: 32%; dose level 2: 50%) were difficult to interpret due to the lack of a well-matched historical cohort for comparison. These CR rates are
dramatically lower than those of single-center phase 2 trials of FCR,23 but are similar to previous international,
multicenter trials.7 Compared to our historical experience
with rituximab-based CIT using the pentostatin and cyclophosphamide platform in a very similar patient population, the ORR (ofatumumab-based CIT: 96%;
rituximab-based CIT: 92%) and CR (ofatumumab-based
CIT: 46%; rituximab-based CIT: 37%) observed with
ofatumumab-based CIT compare favorably to that of
rituximab-based CIT. Ofatumumab-based CIT also
appeared to prolong TTR relative to our historical

experience with rituximab-based CIT. Collectively, these
data suggest a randomized comparison of rituximabbased CIT to ofatumumab-based CIT in CLL may be
warranted.
The restriction of CD20 glycoprotein expression
to B cells has made CD20 an attractive therapeutic target for B-cell malignancies. The precise mechanism of
action of anti-CD20 mAb in CLL remains controversial
and likely differs among the different anti-CD20 antibodies. Rituximab is thought to primarily act through
ADCC24 rather than CDC or direct induction of cell
death.25,26 Ofatumumab was engineered to bind a different epitope of CD20 that is in close proximity to
the cell membrane and has been found to induce substantial CDC.11 Obinutuzumab (GA101) is another
anti-CD20 antibody in clinical testing that is a humanized type II anti-CD20 mAb thought to mediate its
effect by direct killing and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.27
Recent studies compared the effects of these 3 antiCD20 mAbs on CLL B cells in vitro.28 These studies
suggest that ofatumumab induces the greatest complement activation and antibody-dependent phagocytosis
by macrophages among the 3 antibodies, whereas obinutuzumab induces the greatest direct cytotoxicity
(without in vitro crosslinking) and natural killer cellmediated ADCC.28 The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown and which anti-CD20 mAb has the
best efficacy as a single agent and in combination with
chemotherapy can only be determined through
randomized controlled trials.
The response criteria for CLL continue to be based
on the findings of physical examination and bone marrow
biopsy15 at the completion of treatment. Among the 39
patients in our study with no palpable lymphadenopathy
or organomegaly by examination, CT scanning at the
time of response evaluation identified residual lymphadenopathy in 26% including 6 of 22 (27%) of patients who
would be classified as CR based on the results of physical
examination and bone marrow biopsy. Residual lymphadenopathy on CT scans was also detected in 1 out of every
5 patients with MRD-negative CR. These results are consistent with previous studies that suggest residual disease
by CT scan is detectable in 20% to 30% of patients
with a CR by the NCI/IWCLL response criteria.5,29,30
Follow-up is too short and too few events have occurred
to determine whether patients in our study with no palpable lymphadenopathy by examination but with residual
abnormalities on CT have shorter TTR. Currently, the
best available evidence suggests that disease detectable by
CT scan in patients meeting the NCI/IWCLL criteria for
Cancer

CR15 does not impact progression-free survival in patients
treated with CIT.31 The role of CT imaging in the CLL
the response evaluation may become more important if
effective consolidation/maintenance strategies are
developed.19
Despite
our
encouraging
results
with
ofatumumab-based CIT, several qualifications and important questions remain. First, the comparisons of efficacy and toxicity of ofatumumab-based CIT relative to
rituximab-based CIT are derived from comparison to a
historical cohort. Although patients met nearly identical
eligibility criteria and the age, sex, absolute lymphocyte
count, and prognostic profile of treated patients in the
2 cohorts were similar, the suggested improvement in
TTR provides a level of evidence far below a randomized trial. Second, because this study opened 3 years
ago and accrued rapidly, the current median follow-up
(24 months) is relatively short. Although > 80% of
patients have not required retreatment at the 24-month
time point, longer follow-up will be needed to assess
the durability of these remissions. Third, although
40% of the patients in our trial were  age 70 years
and PCO therapy appeared well tolerated among the
older patients in this study, the median age of study
participants remains younger than patients with CLL in
the general population.
The results of this phase 2 study suggest
ofatumumab-based CIT is well tolerated in patients with
previously untreated CLL. The efficacy and toxicity profile of ofatumumab-based CIT compares favorably to historical trials of rituximab-based CIT, suggesting
randomized trials comparing ofatumumab-based CIT
and rituximab-based CIT should be considered.
