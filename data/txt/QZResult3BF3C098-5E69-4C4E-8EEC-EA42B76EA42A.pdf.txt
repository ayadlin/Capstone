ABSTRACT
Sinomenine hydrochloride (SH) has been investigated for its anti-tumor growth
effect. We have previously reported that SH inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation
via MAPKs signaling. However, whether SH could inhibit tumor metastasis has not been
fully explored. In this study, we found that SH suppressed the metastasis potential of
breast cancer cells. The wound healing and transwell assays showed that SH inhibited
the migration and invasion ability of both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
The orthotopic mouse model of 4T1 and the experimental mouse model of MDA-MB231-luc (MDA-MB-231 cell line expressing firefly luciferase) demonstrated that SH
treatment inhibited breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties without obvious hepatotoxicity
and renal toxicity. We also found that SH decreased spleen volume and weight in
both mouse models, especially in the 4T1 mouse model. IL-6, a strong inflammatory
factor causing EMT, was remarkably reduced. Overall, this anti-metastasis effect
of SH could be possibly caused by attenuating inflammatory reaction, which led to
inhibition of EMT and CSC characteristics of breast cancer cells. This study, together
with our previous one, provides more evidence of SH as a potential drug for breast
cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

study also showed that sinomenine hydrochloride (SH)
(Supplementary Figure 1B), a hydrochloride chemical
form of sinomenine which is water soluble, arrested cell
population at G1 phase, caused cell apoptosis and induced
ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-mediated DNA damage in breast
cancer cells through regulation of MAPKs pathways
[5]. During our study of the anti-proliferation effect of
SH [5], we also found that SH could inhibit the invasion
and metastasis ability of breast cancer cells. However,
there is no study fully investigated the anti-invasion
and anti-metastasis effects of SH on breast cancer cells
and explored the potential mechanisms. So we carried
out experiments to explain the anti-invasion and antimetastasis effect of SH on breast cancer cells.
Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant
diseases in western women with an estimated rate of 29%
of all the new cancers in women in 2016 [6]. According to

Sinomenine (Supplementary Figure 1A) is
an abstract isolated from the traditional Chinese
herb Sinomenium acutum Rehd. et Wils. (Fam.
Menispermaceae). Previous studies have reported the
pharmacological effects of sinomenine, including antiarthritis effect [1], anti-inflammatory [2], anti-cancer
effect [3] and so on. Recently, the anti-proliferation and
anti-cancer effects of sinomenine have drawn considerable
attention. Sinomenine inhibited proliferation and induces
apoptosis of NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner
through the mitochondrial pathway [4]. Lu et al. found
that sinomenine increased p21, decreased the Bcl-2/Bax
ratio, promoted the release of Cytochrome c and Omi/
HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and
induced the cleavage of caspase-3 and -9 [3].Our previous

United States will develop breast cancer in her lifetime
[7]. Although more and more effective strategies have
improved patients’ survival, breast cancer metastasis is
still the major reason for morbidity and mortality in breast
cancer patients [8–10]. Therefore, it is necessary to search
for novel effective adjuvant agents to treat metastatic
breast cancer.
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
an essential process in many human activities such
as embryonic development, tissue remodeling and
wound healing [11, 12]. Studies have shown that EMT,
accompanied by loss of polarity and gain of motility, plays
an important role in the process of metastasis [13, 14].
EMT is also involved in the generation of cancer stem
cells (CSCs) [13, 15, 16]. CSC is a small subpopulation of
cancer cells with the ability of self-renewal, contributing
to cancer metastasis and chemoresistance [17, 18]. Studies
show that EMT induction and post-EMT maintenance
rely on microenvironment and cytokines [19, 20]. Thus,
inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine production would
suppress both the EMT process and the generation of
CSCs, leading to more effective therapy.
In this study, we used mouse breast cancer cell line
4T1 and human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231
to investigate the anti-metastasis effect of SH and the
potential mechanisms. The in vitro experiments showed
that SH could inhibit the migration and invasion ability
of breast cancer cells. The in vivo mouse models also
demonstrated that SH inhibited distant metastasis of
breast cancer cells by reversing the EMT transition and
suppressing the CSC phenotypes. SH also inhibited spleen
weight and volume, as well as inflammatory factor IL-6, a
very important inducing and maintenance factor in EMT
and CSC, in both animal models. The inhibition effect of
SH on EMT and CSC generation on breast cancer cells
could be caused by its anti-inflammatory effect.

the control, 75 mg/kg SH and 150 mg/kg SH groups,
respectively (Figure 1F). Then the lungs were fixed
and stained in Bouin’s solution (Figure 1D) and lung
metastatic nodules were counted (Figure 1E). The results
of histological examinations of metastasis of the lungs
and livers were shown in Figure 1G–1J. Compared with
the control group, 150 mg/kg SH treatment reduced lung
index to 28.14% and liver index to 14.86%. We then
examined the liver function and renal function of the mice
to test whether SH treatment would cause obvious toxicity
on mice. The results showed that there was not statistical
significance between the control group and the SH-treated
groups, indicating that SH treatment did not exert obvious
toxicity on mice (Supplementary Table 1).

SH prevented breast cancer metastasis in MDAMB-231-luc metastatic mouse model
To further investigate the effect of SH on breast
cancer metastasis, MDA-MB-231-luc cells were
injected into the tail vein of nude mice to establish
experimental metastasis model. Mouse were injected
with physiologic saline, 75 mg/kg SH or 150 mg/kg SH.
Lung metastasis was monitored by a Xenogen IVIS 2000
Imager consecutively until four weeks of the treatment
(Figure  2A). SH treatment decreased the total lung
fluorescence (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure 2C, more
nodules could be seen on gross lung picture in the control
group. From Figure 2D, we could see that 75 mg/kg and
150 mg/kg SH decreased average lung weight to 0.1593 g
and 0.1533 g, respectively, compared with the control
group of 0.1774 g (p = 0.147 and p = 0.048, respectively).
Although there was a decrease trend of lung weight in low
dose SH treatment, there was no statistical significance. It
could be due to the relative small number of the samples.
The microscopic lung metastasis was evaluated using the
same method as in the 4T1 orthotopic metastasis model.
After treatment with physiologic saline, 75 mg/kg and 150
mg/kg SH, the lung index was 51.17 ± 7.25, 28.50 ± 9.88
and 20.00 ± 6.95, respectively. Compared with the control
group, 75 mg/kg SH treatment reduced lung index to
55.70% and 150 mg/kg SH reduced lung index to 39.09%.
Supplementary Figure 2 showed a very small increase
in weight in all groups without significant difference
between the control group and the treated groups.
Supplementary Table 2 demonstrated no significant liver
and renal function changes of SH in comparison with
physiologic saline. Supplementary Figure 2, together with
Supplementary Table 2 suggested the relative safety of SH
at the chosen doses.

RESULTS
SH blocked breast cancer metastasis in 4T1
orthotopic metastatic mouse model
4T1 cells are very aggressive murine breast cancer
cells which are usually used to make models of late
stage breast tumor to investigate the metastatic behavior
[21]. 1 × 105 4T1 cells were injected into the left second
mammary fat pad of the mice to establish an orthotopic
metastatic mouse model, as the 4T1 cells were obtained
from BALB/c mice, they could spontaneously metastasize
to secondary foci (lymph node, lung, and liver) from the
primary sites. After 4 weeks, SH treatment reduced tumor
volume (Figure 1A) and tumor weight (Figure 1B). After
organs were removed from the mouse under anesthesia,
lung weight was measured. The results showed that the
lung weight was 0.1952 g, 0.1748 g and 0.1672 g in

extravascular activates [22]. During the invasion and
metastasis process, cancer cells need to increase matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and decrease
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP) expression

to degrade ECM [23, 24]. We first detected the serum
levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in both
mouse models by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). For the 4T1 mouse model, the results showed
that SH treatment decreased MMP-9 serum level, while

increased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 serum levels (Figure
3B–3D). However, no significant change of MMP-2
was detected (Figure 3A). For the MDA-MB-231 mouse
model, as we detected human breast cancer cell excretion
in mouse serum, the level of these markers were very low.
Therefore, it required large quantity of serum far beyond
the serum volume of the samples, and due to the very low
concentrations of these tested markers, the established
ELISA standard curve in our preliminary experiments
showed that it was not accurate enough to predict the
samples at such low concentrations.
We further used IHC to reaffirm the results of MMP9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. In 4T1 tumor section specimens,
we found that 150 mg/kg decreased MMP-9 to 38.54%
compared with 75% in the control group, increased
TIMP-1 to 76.04% compared with 31.25% in the control
group, and increased TIMP-2 to 66.15% compared with
33.33% in the control group, respectively. We also could
detect changes in MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the
lung section specimens of MDA-MB-231 experimental
mouse model. SH treatment decreased MMP-9 to 30.21%
compared with 52.08% in the control group, increased
TIMP-1 to 75% compared with 32.29% in the control
group, and increased TIMP-2 to 57.29% compared with
35.42% in the control group, respectively. The change of
TIMP/MMP meant that SH could inhibit breast cancer
cells from degrading ECM, thus preventing metastasis.

We then detected some EMT markers in 4T1 and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines in vitro. After treatment of SH
for 24 h, the western blot results (Figure 5A) showed that
SH treatment increased the epithelial marker E-cadherin,
and decreased the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and
vimentin in 4T1 cell line. However, the downregulation
of N-cadherin was not obvious in MDA-MB-231 cell line
which could be due to different response of different cell
lines at the same time.
We also detected some markers using samples from
mouse models. Figure 5B showed that SH treatment
increased E-cadherin from 26.04% in the control group to
48.96% in the 150 mg/kg group of the tumor specimens
and from 2.08% to 19.79% of the lung samples. In
contrast, SH treatment decreased N-cadherin from 67.13%
in the control group to 30.73% in the 150 mg/kg group
of the tumor specimens and from 59.90% to 32.29% of
the lung samples (Figure 5C). These results suggested the
reverse of EMT by SH treatment.

SH suppressed CSC characteristics in breast
cancer cells
EMT and CSC are interrelated with each other.
Evidence have shown that EMT could induce CSC
characteristics [16]. We wondered whether inhibition
of EMT by SH could contribute to some changes in the
CSC characteristics. Mammosphere formation is good
a way to assess self-renewal ability of CSCs, involving
in vitro spheroids formation in the non-adherent culture
conditions. The results showed that SH decreased the
number of sphenoid colonies of both 4T1 and MDAMB-231 (Figure 6A). The number of sphenoid colonies
of 0 and 0.5 μmol/mL SH treatment was 74.33 and 46.67
for 4T1, respectively (p < 0.01). The number of sphenoid
colonies of 0 and 0.5 μmol/mL SH treatment was 40.67
and 26.33 for MDA-MB-231, respectively (p < 0.05).
CD44 and Sox-2 are both markers of stem cancer
cell. We used flow cytometer to assess CD44 changes in
MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cell lines first. Figure 6B showed
0.5 µmol/mL SH decreased expression of CD44 on cell
membrane in both cell lines. We then evaluated their
expression in tumor samples and lung samples. Figure
6C–6D demonstrated that SH decreased CD44 and Sox-2
in both mouse models, suggesting the inhibition of CSC
by SH treatment.

SH impaired migration and invasion ability and
inhibited EMT process in breast cancer cells
Since EMT is recognized for its role in tumor
metastasis [11, 15], we then examined whether SH could
reverse the EMT process in breast cancer cells. As EMT
process often facilitates cancer cell motility and invasion,
we examined the effect of SH on cancer cell migration
in vitro. Wound healing assay was first used to measure
the effect of SH on cancer cell migration. As shown in
Figure 4A, after treatment with SH, a clear time- and
dose-dependent inhibition was observed. After treatment
with 0.25 and 0.5 μmol/mL SH for 24 h, the migration
areas were about 68.52% and 62.88% of that of the
control group for 4T1, respectively, and 88.79% and
63.68% of that of the control group for MDA-MB-231,
respectively.
Transwell migration method was used to confirm
the impairment of SH on the migration ability of 4T1 and
MDA-MB-231. Treatment with SH at 0.25 and 0.5 μmol/
mL significantly impaired the migration ability of 4T1
and MDA-MB-231. The inhibition rates of 0.5 μmol/mL
SH for 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 were 59.94% and 72.9%,
respectively (Figure 4B) Similar results were found in
the matrigel-coated transwell invasion assay. The results
showed that 0.5 μmol/mL SH inhibited the invasion ability
of 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 to 60.77% and 65.28% of that
of the control group, respectively (Figure 4C).

SH inhibited inflammation response elicited by
breast cancer cells
SH is famous for its remarkable anti-inflammation
effect in rheumatic arthritis. Most of the previous studies
also focused more on its anti-inflammatory effect. EMT is
also known for its induction and maintenance by cytokines
and inflammatory factors [19, 20]. We wondered whether
the inhibition of EMT and CSC was due to the anti13564

Oncotarget

inflammation of SH. Obvious decreases of spleen volume
and weight were found in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model
(Figure 7A and 7B). The results showed that the volume
of the control group was 2.58 cm3, the 75 mg/kg group
was 1.45 cm3, and the 150 mg/kg group was 1.24 cm3. The
spleen weight of the control group, the 75 mg/kg and the
150 mg/kg group were 0.6885 g, 0.3993 g and 0.3593 g,
respectively. There is significant difference of between the
control group and the treatment groups. For the MDA-MB231-luc mouse model, SH treatment also decreased both
the spleen volume and spleen weight (Figure 7C and 7D).
However, despite of a decrease trend in spleen volume,
there was no significance between the control group and
the treatment groups (p = 0.278 for control vs 75 mg/kg
group; p = 0.052 for control vs 150 mg/kg group).
IL-6 is one of the famous factors inducing EMT
and also has been shown to be reduced by SH. We then

detected the expression of IL-6 inflammatory factors in
tumor specimens of 4T1 and lung specimens of MDAMB-231. Figure 7F and 7G showed that 150 mg/kg SH
decreased IL-6 to 89.58% compared 56.25% with the
control group in 4T1 tumor specimens. Similar results
were found in the MDA-MB-231 lung specimens. IL-6
could be secreted by many inflammatory cells as well as
tumor cells. We wondered whether the reduction of IL-6
in mouse samples was a direct effect on tumor cells or
was an indirect effect on inflammatory cells. We then
detected the effect of SH on IL-6 expression in vitro to
help us answer this question. IL-6 is mainly secreted by
monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and some types of
T cells in body [25] . RAW 246.7 is a murine macrophage
cell line that could be cultured in vitro. We selected
RAW 246.7 as the representative inflammatory cell line
as macrophage is one of the main production of IL-6 in

found initially sensitive to chemotherapy, but later develop
chemoresistance and metastasis. As we know most breast
cancer mortality results from cancer relapse with invasion
and metastasis [6, 26, 27], therefore, effective decrease or
treatment of metastasis is important to improve life quality
and increase life survival for breast cancer patients.
Cancer metastasis is a complex biological event
including two main parts, namely the intravasation
process, in which cancer cells of local tumors invade the
basement membrane and circulate through the blood, and
the extravasation process, in which the cancer cells escape

DISCUSSION
Although many preventive methods and diagnostic
methods have been made to try to detect breast cancer in
early stages, there are still a lot of people diagnosed at
late stages or with metastasis. Besides, some patients are

from the capillary wall and survive at distant organ sites
[28] . Our previous studies found that SH could effectively
inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation [5]. In this study,
we investigated the anti-metastasis effect of SH on breast
cancer cells in both mouse models of breast cancer.
Choosing suitable models which could mimic
the real metastatic process is the first step to study
breast cancer metastasis. In the orthotopic metastatic
mouse model, cancer cells need to go through both the
intravasation and extravasation processes to initiate
tumor formation on a new site. 4T1 murine mammary
carcinoma cells were always used for its highly metastatic
potential in immunocompetent mice. 4T1 mouse model,
a model of late-stage breast cancer [29, 30], was chosen
to assess the effect of SH on the whole metastatic process
from the primary tumor location to the new site via the
hematogenous pathway. We found significant differences
between the control group and the SH-treated groups.

75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg SH both decreased the tumor
volume and tumor weight in comparison with the control
group. More important, SH treatment inhibited lung
weight, indicating the anti-metastatic ability of SH. From
a microscopic view, SH reduced both lung and liver
metastatic index, demonstrating that SH could inhibit new
metastatic foci of breast cancer tumors.
Although 4T1 orthotopic mouse model represents
the natural metastatic event more authentically, it has a
disadvantage, namely 4T1 is a murine cell line. Thus we
still wanted to examine the anti-metastatic effect of SH on
human breast cancers. Meanwhile, SH treatment inhibited
primary tumor growth which could influence tumor cell
metastasis [31]. In the experimental metastatic mouse
model, MDA-MB-231-luc human breast cancer cells were
introduced directly into the tail vein and passed through
the lung microvasculature [22]. This model mainly mimics
the extravasation process of metastasis. The cell line was

modified with firefly luciferase, allowing us to monitor
the lung metastasis non-invasively and dynamically [30].
We found that SH treatment decreased the lung metastasis
during the consecutive monitor. Overall, both animal
models suggested the strong anti-invasion and metastatic
effects of SH.
In order to metastasize to new sites, cancer cells
need to degrade down the ECM. MMPs and TIMPs act
together to control ECM degradation [32, 33]. Therefore,
MMPs and TIMPs changes are good markers of the
metastatic activity of cancer cells. Research have shown
that both MMPs and TIMPs are involved in breast cancer
progression [24, 34]. Some studies even showed the
different breast cancer subtypes contained different MMPs
and TIMPs patterns [35, 36]. Here, we found that SH
could inhibit MMP-9 and increased TIMP-1 and TIMP2 both serum levels and cell expression levels in 4T1
mouse model. However, we only detected the same cell
expression changes in MDA-MB-231-luc mouse model
due to very low concentrations of these factors in serum.
The decreased MMP-9 and increased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2
together indicated a change of metastatic activity after SH
treatment in the two mouse models.
EMT is demonstrated to play a role in the
development of invasion, metastasis and therapy
resistance [15]. EMT is an essential process during embryo
genesis and adult tissue repair and maintenance, with
characteristics of loss of epithelial traits such as cell-cell
adhesion and acquisition of mesenchymal properties such
as acquisition of motility [15, 37]. It is accompanied by
decrease epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, occludins
and claudins, and increase mesenchymal markers such as
N-cadherin and vimentin. E-cadherin is expressed at cellcell adhesion junctions and required for the formation of
epithelia during the embryo period and maintenance of
epithelia homeostasis in adulthood [37]. Research have
shown that low E-cadherin is related to higher tumor
grade and stage, meanwhile, loss or genetic mutation of
E-cadherin expression contributes cancer development
[38]. However, E-cadherin reduction alone is not sufficient
enough for EMT [38, 39]. The EMT also includes the
acquisition of mesenchymal properties. We then started the
investigation of EMT by examine the expression changes
of the markers. Here, we reported that SH treatment
increased E-cadherin while decreased N-cadherin in tumor
specimens of 4T1 mouse model and lung specimens of
MDA-MB-231-luc mouse model, suggesting SH could
inhibit EMT, which might contribute its anti-invasion and
anti-metastatic potentials.
Research have shown that cells that undergo EMT
also acquire stem cell-like properties [16]. CSCs were
discovered first in the hematopoietic system and later
in human solid tumors such as breast cancer and brain
cancer [40–42]. CSCs are a small population of neoplastic
cells within a tumor with self-renewal capability and
tumor initiating ability and are shown to play a role in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the malignant process of tumors, such as drug resistance,
invasion and metastasis [15]. EMT enables cancer cells
the ability to metastasize as well as the ability to replicate
in order to form new tumor foci [13, 16]. The pluripotent
cell marker includes but not limits to CD44, OCT4,
SOX2, Klf4 and Nanog. CD44, a cell-surface glycoprotein
involved in cell adhesion and migration, is recognized as
one of the important CSC markers, especially in mammary
CSCs [43]. There are also some studies showing that Sox2, but not OCT4 and Nanog, that plays an important role in
breast CSCs [44]. Research has shown that the expression
of Sox-2 in early stage of breast cancers [45]. Also,
estrogen receptor α could regulate breast tumor-initiating
cells targeting Sox-2 [46]. Our experiments demonstrated
that SH down-regulated CD44 and Sox-2 expression in
primary tumor specimens and metastatic lung specimens.
The inhibition of CSC properties by SH was confirmed
using in vitro mammosphere formation assay, which
depends on the self-renewing ability of CSCs.
Microenvironment and cytokines related to tumor
microenvironment are known to induce EMT [47].
Meanwhile, the factors play a role in the maintenance
of post-EMT mesenchymal status once it is started
[20]. SH is most famous for its treatment of rheumatic
arthritis due to anti-inflammatory effects. In our research,
when we removed organs from mouse, we found that
SH decreased spleen volume and weight, especially in
the 4T1 mouse model, which could be due to the partial
immunosuppression of nude mice used in the MDAMB-231 mouse model. Spleen is an organ involved in
the inflammation response. So we hypothesized that the
inhibition effect of SH on EMT could be contributed by its
inhibition on the production of inflammatory factors. IL-6 is
one of the important cytokines involved in the EMT process
[19] and previous studies concerning SH also demonstrated
that SH could inhibit IL-6 [48, 49]. Our results found that
SH reduced IL-6 expression in tumor specimens and lung
specimens. We then used both tumor cells and macrophage
cells, two of the many different sources of IL-6, to detect
the effect of SH on IL-6 production in vitro. We found
that SH decreased IL-6 production in both tumor cells
MDA-MB-231 and RAW 246.7. IL-6 concentration was
too low to detect in 4T1 cells. This might suggest that the
reduction of IL-6 expression in tumor specimens and lung
specimens could be an integrated result as suppression of
IL-6 secretion in both tumor cells and inflammatory cells
in vivo. However, even if the inhibition effect of SH on
both tumor cells and inflammatory cells were confirmed
by in vitro experiment, the mechanism in vivo may not
be as simple as it was in vitro. Il-6 is not only secreted to
influence other cytokines, but also to function to influence
its own production [25]. Besides, IL-6 production from
tumor cells and other inflammatory cells influence each
other. There were studies showing that IL-6 production
from macrophage could induce IL-6 secretion from tumor
cells [50]. What’s more, in the detection of MMP and

Cell culture

TIMP in serum samples of mouse models, we could find
secretion changes in samples from MDA-MB-231 but
at a very low level which required too much samples. In
contrast, in the 4T1 mouse model, we detected relatively
high concentrations of MMP and TIMP. The actual total
serum cytokines came from both cancer cells and mouse
inflammatory cells. For the MDA-MB-231 mouse model,
because we detected the production of these cytokines of
human MDA-MB-231 in the mouse model and thus the
human cytokines of MMP and TIMP secretion might be
diluted in mouse serum. This might explain why the serum
secretion was so low and suggested that the cytokines were
not only come from tumor cells or host cell in vivo. All this
suggested the cytokines secretion in the mouse model was
a complicated process. In all, comparing with the control
group, the remarkable decrease effect of SH on spleen
volume and spleen weight, as well as the reduction effect
of IL-6 production, indicated that SH could inhibit breast
cancer metastasis by suppressing EMT and CSC which was
due to the anti-inflammation effect such as IL-6.
Although more studies focusing on the anti-cancer
effect of SH need to be done, this research gives us a new
sight into the clinically used drug SH beyond its normal
anti-rheumatic arthritis effect, helping us to uncover more
potential anti-cancer effects of SH.

Murine breast cancer cell line 4T1, murine
macrophage cell line RAW246.7, and human breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were obtained from
Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology (Shanghai, PR China)
in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The bioluminescent
cell line MDA-MB-231-luc was obtained in our previous
experiments [51]. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/
ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated
at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO2 and saturated
humidity.

Wound healing assay
Wound healing assay was performed to assess the
motility of cells exposed to SH. 4T1 and MDA-MB-231
cells were seeded in 6-well plates. When cells grew up to
90–100% confluence, the cell monolayer was scraped by
a white pipette tip. Then the detached cells were washed
with PBS and serum-free medium containing different
concentrations of SH was added. Pictures were taken
under an inverted microscopy (Leica, Germany) at 0, 12
and 24 h. The percentage of inhibition was normalized as
the percentage of the untreated cells (100%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Transwell migration assay

Drug and agents

Briefly, a total of 1 × 105 4T1 and MDA-MB-231
cells in 200 μL serum-free medium were added in the
upper transwell chambers and treated with various
concentrations of SH. The lower chambers were filled
with 600 μL medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the
non-migratory cells on the upper surface of the chambers
were removed by a cotton swab and the migrated cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with
0.5% crystal violet. Then at least five randomly chosen
fields were photographed under a microscope (Leica,
Germany). Finally, the migrated cells were dissolved
in 30% acetic acid and measured by a microplate
reader (PerkinElmer, USA) at 570 nm. The percentage
of inhibition was normalized as the percentage of the
untreated cells (100%).

SH was obtained from Zhengqing Pharmaceutical
Group (Hunan, China). SH was dissolved in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) at 10 μmol/mL and
filtered using 0.22 μm sterile filters (Millipore). Matrigel
was purchased from BD Bioscience (Pasadena, CA,
USA). Transwell chambers with 8 μm pore polycarbonate
membrane filters (Corning, NY, USA) were used to
explore the migration and invasion ability of 4T1 and
MDA-MB-231 cells in response to SH. The ELISA kits
of MMP-2 (CSB-E04676m for mouse; CSB-E04675h
for human), MMP-9 (CSB-E08007m for mouse; CSBE08006h for human), TIMP-1 (CSB-E08004m for mouse;
CSB-E08003h for human), TIMP-2 (CSB-E07387m
for mouse; CSB-E04733h for human) and IL-6 (CSBE04639m for mouse; CSB-E04638h for human) were
bought from Cusabio biotech (Wuhan, China).
The antibodies against E-cadherin, N-cadherin and
Vimentin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA). The antibodies against MMP9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, Sox-2, β-actin and horse-radish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). The antibodies for IL-6 and CD44 were bought
from Abcom Biotechnology (Cambridge, MA, USA).

Matrigel invasion assay
Matrigel was diluted 1:5 with DMEM. Transwell
filters were coated with 50 μl the dilution. A total of
1 × 105 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 μL serumfree medium were added in the upper chamber and treated
with various concentrations of SH. The lower chamber
was filled with 600 μL medium containing 10% FBS.
After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated the same as
the procedures for the migration assay.

Mammosphere formation assay

Experimental breast tumor metastasis model

Mammosphere formation assay was performed as
previously described [52]. Cells were treated with SH
for 48 h and collected to seed into ultralow attachment
plates (Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 4000 cells /
well. Cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM/F12
medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml human epidermal
growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml human basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), 2% B27 supplement and 1% N2
supplement. On day 10, the number of tumorspheres
(diameter > 50 μm) in each well were evaluated using an
inverted microscope.

Four-week old female BALB/c athymic nude
mice with body weights approximately 18–20 g were
purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co.
Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and housed in the Laboratory
Animal Centre of Xi’an Jiaotong University. After one
week’s acclimation, 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231-luc cells in
100 μl PBS were injected into the tail vein of nude mice.
On the day following injection, the mice were randomly
assigned to three group (n = 6). Animals in the control
group were i.p. injected with 0.1 mL physiologic saline
per 10 g body weight daily and the treatment groups were
injected i.p. with SH at doses of 75 or 150 mg/kg of body
weight, dissolved in physiologic saline. Bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) was performed weekly using luciferin
and a Xenogen IVIS 2000 Luminal Imager to monitor
lung metastasis for 4 weeks. Luciferin was stocked at a
concentration of 15 mg/mL and was injected i.p. at a dose
of 10 μL/g of mouse weight. Luminescence is expressed as
photons/sec/ROI (region of interest). At the experimental
endpoint, mice were euthanized and the organs were
prepared for H&E staining and IHC analysis. For H&E
analysis, the metastatic foci area was divided into five
grades and numbered 1 to 5. The total numbers of each
histologic section were added together as the index for
lung or liver metastasis.

FACScan flow cytometer analysis
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning, NY)
and treated with different concentrations of SH. Then cells
were collected at the indicated time. Samples of at least
1 × 106 cells were stained with anti-CD44-APC conjugate
(103008, Biolegend) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were
washed 3 times and then analyzed by flow cytometry.

Western blot assay
Cells were treated with SH and lysed in RIPA.
Proteins were collected and analyzed using a similar
method as our previously reported study [5].

IHC analysis

Orthotopic breast tumor metastasis model

IHC analysis were performed as previous [5]. The
intensity of the staining was scored as 1 (negative), 2
(weakly positive), 3 (moderately positive) or 4 (strongly
positve). The extent of the staining was categorized as
1 (stained cells: 1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%) or 4
(76–100%) for the tissues. The final staining score was
the product of the intensity and the extent scores. Five
images of random fields were taken from each specimen
for quantitative analysis.

All animal procedures were performed according
to the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Xi’an Jiaotong University.
Four-week old female Balb/c strains of mice with body
weights approximately 18–20 g were obtained from
and housed in the Laboratory Animal Centre of Xi’an
Jiaotong University. Each mouse was injected with 1 × 105
4T1 cells into the left second mammary fat pad (day 1).
The mice were randomly distributed into three groups
(n = 6) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.1 mL
physiologic saline per 10 g body weight daily (control
group) or SH at doses of 75 or 150 mg/kg of body weight,
dissolved in physiologic saline (experimental groups)
from the third day. Tumor sizes were measured twice
or three times a week using calipers and tumor volumes
were calculated according to the standard formula: width2
* length/2 and expressed as cm3. The mice were treated
for four weeks. At the end of treatment, the mice were
sacrificed and the organs and tumors of the mice were
collected. Lung tissues were fixed in Bouin’s solution for
24 h and taken pictures. Spleen volumes were calculated
using the formula: length*width*height and expressed as
cm3. The tissues were fixed and prepared for Hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) analysis.

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD) from at least three independent experiments. The
differences between the control and treatment groups were
compared by t-test or ANOVA methods. All statistical
analyses were performed using (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). P values < 0.05 (*) or < 0.01 (#) were considered as
statistically significant.
