Abstract

Author Manuscript

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common form of kidney cancer, is usually
linked to inactivation of the pVHL tumor suppressor protein and consequent accumulation of the
HIF2α transcription factor 1. Here we show that a small molecule (PT2399) that directly inhibits
HIF2α causes tumor regression in preclinical models of primary and metastatic pVHL-defective
ccRCC in an on-target fashion. pVHL-defective ccRCC cell lines display unexpectedly variable
sensitivity to PT2399, however, suggesting the need for predictive biomarkers.
HIF2α, as a bHLH-PAS domain protein, would usually be deemed undruggable. Bruick and
Gardner’s work, however, followed by medicinal chemistry efforts at Peloton Therapeutics,
led to drug-like chemicals such as PT2399 (Fig. 1a) that can bind directly to the HIF2α PAS
B domain (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a, b) and cripple HIF2α’s ability to bind to
ARNT (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c), and hence to DNA 2–6. PT2399 minimally
affected a panel of 68 receptors, ion channels, and enzymes (Supplementary Table 1).

Treating 786-O VHL−/− ccRCC cells with PT2399 repressed various HIF target genes in
mRNA microarray (Fig. 1c), real-time PCR (Fig. 1e and f and Extended Data Fig. 1d),
immunoblot (Fig. 1g) and ELISA (Fig. 1h) assays. PT2399 did not suppress HIF1α-specific
targets such as BNIP3 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). PT2399 destabilized HIF2α,
which might enhance its effects on HIF2α DNA-binding activity (Fig. 1e, g and Extended
Data Fig. 1f). PT2399 downregulated genes sets induced by hypoxia, HIF, and c-Myc,
consistent with reports that HIF2α and c-Myc cooperate to promote ccRCC 7,8 (Fig. 1d,
Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 2).

Author Manuscript

Next we made HIF2α −/− 786-O cells using CRISPR-Cas9 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). They
proliferated under standard conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f), consistent with the effects
of HIF2α shRNA and pVHL in 786-O cells 9,10. We then lentivirally reintroduced wild-type
HIF2α, or a HIF2α missense mutant (S304M) with an occluded PT2399-binding pocket 4,
into these cells (Fig. 2a). PT2399’s effects on HIF-responsive mRNAs was largely
eliminated in cells lacking HIF2α (Fig. 1c, d) or producing HIF2α S304M (Fig. 2b).

Author Manuscript

PT2399 (up to 2 μM) minimally altered ccRCC cell line proliferation under standard cell
culture conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2c and g–j). 20 μM PT2399 caused off-target toxicity
because it inhibited the proliferation of HIF2α −/− 786-O cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a, d–f)
and other cancer cell lines with undetectable HIF2α (Extended Data Fig. 2k–m). PT2399
did, however, inhibit 786-O cell soft agar growth at 0.2–2 μM (Fig. 2c and g and Extended
Data Fig. 3a and f). This effect was specific because it was reversed by HIF2α S304M (Fig.
2d, g) and not seen in SLR21 VHL+/+ ccRCC cells (Extended Data Fig. 3c and f). Similarly,
HIF2α −/− 786-O cells did not form soft agar colonies unless rescued with exogenous
HIF2α (Fig. 2e–g and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Therefore, PT2399 decreases HIF-dependent
transcription and soft agar growth in an on-target manner.
As a step toward imaging studies we infected 786-O cells, as well as isogenic cells
expressing exogenous pVHL, with a lentivirus encoding firefly luciferase (Luc) driven by a
HIF-responsive promoter (3XHRE-Luc). As expected, PT2399 inhibited Luc activity in the
VHL−/− cells, but not in their pVHL-proficient counterparts (Fig. 3a, b). Conversely, the
diooxygenase inhibitor DMOG, which blocks the binding of pVHL to HIFα, induced Luc
activity in the pVHL-proficient cells, but not the VHL−/− cells (Fig. 3a). As expected,
PT2399 did not affect Luc driven by constitutive promoters, such as the CMV promoter
(Fig. 3c).

Author Manuscript

Next, 786-O 3XHRE-Luc cells and 786-O CMV-Luc cells were injected into opposing
kidneys of nude mice. Once tumors were established, as determined by serial
bioluminescence imaging (BLI), the mice were given PT2399 or vehicle twice daily
(Extended Data Fig 1h and i). Two days of PT2399 decreased the 3XHRE-Luc signal by
more than 60%, similar to its effects in vitro (Fig. 3d, f). These effects were not observed in
the CMV-Luc tumors nor with the vehicle (Fig. 3d, e). The 3XHRE-Luc signal recovered
after a drug washout period and decreased again after drug rechallenge (Fig. 3g). Analysis of
kidneys removed after 2 days of PT2399 treatment revealed decreased HIF-responsive
mRNAs, decreased Ki-67 staining, increased Caspase 3 cleavage and decreased microvessel
density (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e).

To assess antitumor efficacy 786-O CMV-Luc cells were grown orthotopically in nude mice
and, once established, treated with PT2399 or vehicle. As expected, tumors continued to
grow in vehicle treated mice, as shown by weekly BLI. In contrast, PT2399 caused tumor
stasis or regression (Fig. 4a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4f), which correlated with decreased
circulating tumor-derived VEGF (Extended Data Fig. 4g), decreased proliferation and
decreased angiogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 4h).

Author Manuscript

Kidney-confined ccRCC can often be treated surgically. We therefore obtained a metastatic
variant of 786-O cells (M2A cells) expressing Luc under an HSV TK promoter, which form
diffuse lung colonies after tail vein injection 11. In this model PT2399 still caused marked
tumor regressions and prolonged survival (Fig. 4d–f). Similar results were obtained when a
limited number of cells were injected in an effort to better mimic established lung metastases
(Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). Introducing HIF2α S304M into M2A cells (Fig. 4g) conferred
partial resistance to PT2399’s pharmacodynamic (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and antitumor
effects (Fig. 4h and i).
PT2399 also inhibited A498 VHL−/− ccRCC cells in soft agar and orthotopic tumor assays
(Extended Data Fig. 3b, f, and Extended Data Fig. 6), consistent with the effects of HIF2α
shRNAs in these cells10, and inhibited a VHL−/− ccRCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
(Extended Data Fig. 5d and e). In contrast, PT2399 did not suppress orthotopic tumors
formed by VHL−/− UMRC-2 cells or VHL−/− 769-P cells (Fig. 5a–d) despite inhibiting
HIF2α dimerization and HIF2α-dependent transcription in these cells with IC50s
comparable to those seen in 786-O and A498 cells (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 7a–d)
and despite effective suppression of HIF target genes, when measured, in vivo (Extended
Data Fig. 8a).

To study this differential sensitivity further we measured HIF2α abundance and the response
of selected HIF target genes to PT2399 and to pVHL across a VHL−/− ccRCC cell line
panel. The PT2399-sensitive 786-O and A498 cells had higher HIF2α levels than the
insensitive UMRC-2 and 769-P cells (Fig. 5e). They also exhibited the greatest inhibition of
HIF target genes, as a percentage of basal expression, in response to PT2399 (Fig. 5f and
Extended Data Fig. 8d, e) and, where tested, pVHL (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). The latter
further supported that this differential sensitivity to PT2399 reflects differences in HIF2α
dependence rather than differences in intracellular drug accumulation. Indeed, soft agar
growth by UMRC-2 cells and 769-P cells was, in contrast to 786-O and A-498 cells,
insensitive to Cas9-mediated inactivation of HIF2α and to PT2399 (Fig. 5g–j and Extended
Data Fig. 3c, f and g). Similarly, soft agar growth by SKRC-20 and UMRC-6 VHL−/−
ccRCC cells was unaffected by genetic disruption of HIF2α and to PT2399 (Extended Data
Fig. 3c–g). RCC10 cell soft agar growth was unaffected by PT2399, but was suppressed in
an on-target manner by Cas9-mediated loss of HIF2α, despite a similar decrease in HIF2
target mRNAs in response to both (Extended Data Fig. 3c–g, and Extended Data Fig. 9a–f).
The significance of this discrepancy is unclear because the HIF2α−/− RCC10 cells quickly
regained the ability to grow in soft agar after repeated culture despite persistent HIF2α loss
(see also below). Finally, we confirmed that genetic disruption of HIF2α, like PT2399, did
not affect orthotopic tumor growth by UMRC-2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 10).

Differential HIF2α dependence amongst ccRCC lines is not linked to their HIF1α status
because the insensitive cell lines 769-P and SKRC-20, like the sensitive cell lines 786-O and
A498, lack wild-type HIF1α 12. Moreover, Cas9-mediated ablation of HIF1α in UMRC-2
cells did not render them HIF2α-dependent in soft agar assays (Extended Data Fig. 7e–g).
In contrast, HIF2α dependence across the ccRCC lines we examined loosely correlated with
their basal HIF2α levels and the dependence of HIF target genes in those lines on HIF2α
itself. A caveat is that some of these lines might have lost their dependence on HIF2α due to
prolonged passage in culture, especially as HIF2α is not required under standard culture
conditions. On the other hand, freshly explanted ccRCC PDXs are also variably sensitive to
PT239913.

Author Manuscript

To begin to understand this differential HIF2α dependence further, we focused on RCC10
cells because HIF target genes and soft agar growth are less HIF2α-dependent in these cells
than in 786-O and A498 cells despite their comparably high HIF2α levels (Fig. 5e, Extended
Data Fig. 3c–g, and Extended Data Fig. 9b). We discovered that RCC10 cells harbor the
canonical p53 R248W mutant (Extended Data Fig. 9g). p53 R248W also arose
spontaneously in a 786-O subclone made in our laboratory (Extended Data Fig. 9h) and was
associated with acquired resistance to PT2399 (Extended Data Fig. 9i). p53 was not induced
by DNA damage in the HIF2-independent lines UMRC-2 and 769-P, suggesting they also
have p53 pathway mutations, but was induced in the HIF2-independent lines UMRC-6 and
Caki-2 (Extended Data Fig. 9g, j). Of note, p53 was modestly induced by PT2399 and Cas9mediated loss of HIF2α in p53+/+ 786-O cells (Extended Data Fig. 9h, k), consistent with
reports that HIF2α constrains p53 activity in ccRCC14,15. Therefore an intact p53 pathway
seems necessary, but not sufficient, for HIF2-dependence in ccRCC.

Author Manuscript

Our findings suggest that the response of VHL−/− ccRCC to HIF2α antagonists will be
variable and will demand predictive biomarkers, perhaps including measures of HIF2α
activity and p53 status. The current view that p53 mutations are uncommon in ccRCC is
based mainly on studies of primary tumors removed at nephrectomy1. p53 pathway
mutations might be more common in metastatic ccRCC, from which most ccRCC lines are
derived, or might arise after ccRCC therapies 16. Alternatively, some p53 mutations in
ccRCC lines might have arisen ex vivo. Another important question is whether adding
HIF2α antagonists will enhance the activity of existing ccRCC drugs.

independent experiments. The reason for the variable HIF2α levels in (c) is unknown but
could reflect, at least partly, variable amounts of host-derived cells in the tumor samples. d,
Levels of the indicated mRNAs, normalized to beta actin, in tumors from a–c. Data as
median with range (b, d). Statistical significance was assessed by using two-tailed Student’s
t-tests (b) or Mann-Whitney test (d). Loss of HIF2α did suppress subcutaneous tumor
growth (data not shown).
