Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been described as a protein that plays an important role
in both innate and acquired immunity. Further research has shown that MIF plays a particularly critical part
in cell cycle regulation and therefore in tumorigenesis as well. Over the past few years, the significance of
the role of MIF in a variety of both solid and hematologic tumors has been established. More recently, interest has increased in the role of MIF in the development of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, in which it
appears to influence cell cycle control. In addition, MIF has been identified as an essential actor in metastasis and angiogenesis. Vascular growth factor concentration raises because of increased levels of MIF in
brain tumors. Recently, the MIF receptor complex has been described, and it appears that this may be a
suitable drug target for treatment of brain tumors. In light of these findings, the authors chose to conduct
a systematic search for information regarding MIF that has been published within the past 15 years using
the terms ‘‘inflammation,’’ ‘‘glioblastoma,’’ ‘‘brain tumor,’’ ‘‘astrocytoma,’’ ‘‘microglia,’’ ‘‘glioblastoma,’’
‘‘immune system and brain tumors,’’ ‘‘glioblastoma and MIF,’’ and ‘‘brain tumor and MIF.’’ The aim of this article was thus to present a detailed review of current knowledge regarding the role of MIF in CNS tumor

Migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was first characterized in 1966 as a molecule that inhibits the
migration of macrophages,1,2 a role that inspired its name. Much research has been done since that time,
yielding evidence that MIF primarily acts as a proinflammatory protein.3 For instance, it was shown that
MIF acts not only on macrophages, but is also produced by these cells in response to endotoxins, exotoxins,
and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interferon-c. In addition, it was demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies against MIF protect mice against septic shock.4
Structural analysis has revealed that MIF is comprised of 115 amino acids with a molecular weight of 12.5
kilodaltons (kD).2 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the secondary structure of MIF consists of

Mechanism of MIF Function
In its active form, 3 MIF monomers align to form a
homotrimeric molecule that is homologous to the enzyme
D-dopachrome-tautomerase.6 On the basis of this structure, it was hypothesized by Rosengreen et al that MIF
may display some enzymatic activity.7 To our knowledge,
not much is known at this stage regarding the physiologic
substrate and importance of this enzymatic activity. However, use of an inhibitor of the enzyme D-dopachrometautomerase (ISO-1) resulted in reduced activity of MIF,8
thus giving rise to the hypothesis that the enzymatic activity of the protein might be important for its proper functioning. Also, Meyer-Siegler et al recently demonstrated
the inhibitory function of ISO-1 on MIF-promoted tumor progression.9
MIF has been known to modulate the immune sys10,11
tem.
In recent years, the work of several groups has
revealed some information regarding the role of MIF in
tumorigenesis.12 Specifically, MIF is abundant in various
types of cancers, including prostate,13 colon,14 melanoma,15 and glioblastoma,9,10 among others.
2032

There are several ways in which MIF influences tumor growth and development. Specifically, MIF is capable of inducing angiogenesis,16,17 promoting cell cycle
progression,18,19 inhibiting apoptosis,20 and inhibiting
the lysing of tumor cells by natural killer (NK) cells.15,21
MIF expression in tumor cells is mainly influenced by cell
stress22 and growth factors.19 Work by Chesney and
Takahashi has shown that both anti-MIF treatment and
the use of MIF antisense strands alter the proliferative
state of tumor cells.19,23
Despite this information regarding the role of MIF
in carcinogenesis, it took some time to identify a possible
receptor for MIF and obtain information concerning the
intracellular signaling cascade. Initially, it was thought
that there may be an interaction between sarcolectin (a
constituent of albumin) and MIF.24,25 Although early on
there were no experimental data to support this biologic
interaction, Kleemann et al were eventually successful in
demonstrating that MIF is taken up by cells and binds to
c-Jun activation domain–binding protein-1, inhibiting
the activation of the transcription factor AP-1.26
Experimental work from Leng et al contributed to
further knowledge regarding MIF signaling by characterizing CD74 as a potential MIF receptor.27 They demonstrated that fluorescence-coupled MIF binds with high
affinity to the CD74 receptor. CD74 itself is known to be
involved in the transport of export enzymes from the
Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. However,
given that CD74 is also abundant on the cell surface, it
appears very likely that it also serves as a receptor for
MIF. Interestingly, CD74 mediates MIF binding. However, CD44, a transmembrane coreceptor, is required
for MIF-induced ERK1 and ERK2 kinase phosphorylation. MIF binding was associated with serine phosphorylation of both CD74 and CD44 receptor.28 The
activation of both receptors is required for MIF protection from apoptosis.
In addition to interaction with CD74 and CD44
receptors, the role of MIF as a noncognate ligand for
CXCR4 and CXCR2 has been described,29 and these
receptors have been identified as functional receptors. In
this context, MIF competed with known cognate ligands
for these receptors and elicited monocyte arrest in
inflamed atherosclerotic arteries via interaction and complex formation with CDCR2 and CD74, rapid integrin
activation, and calcium influx. MIF deficiency impaired

FIGURE 2. Intracellular mechanisms of macrophage inhibitory
factor (MIF) are shown. The action is mediated in part by the
CD74/CD44 receptor complex and leads to activation of the
mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase pathway. This is
mediated by activation of tyrosine kinase and is part of the
sustained activation pathway. The activation of this pathway
finally results in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb)
gene and subsequent cell proliferation. In addition, MIF can
trigger a transient/rapid activation by direct interaction with cJun activation domain–binding protein-1 (Jab1; Jab1 ¼ CSN subunit number 5) or receptor-mediated induction of PI3-kinase.
The latter leads to an antiapoptotic pathway, whereas activation of Jab1 promotes V-Raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene
homolog 1 (RAF-1) and MAP kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1 (MEK-1) pathways. In addition, numbers 1 to 3 within the figure indicate possible
interaction points for a therapeutic intervention. CSN5 indicates

monocyte adhesion to cell walls in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. The authors concluded that MIF displays
chemokine-like functions and acts as a regulator of
inflammatory cell recruitment. The cellular signaling cascade is summarized in Figure 2.
MIF is capable of inhibiting acute inflammation
and thereby killing cells, a function that may constitute
the first step in tumorigenesis. Its main action includes
counter-regulation of glucocorticoid action by preventing
the activation of NF-kB, a primary target of steroids.30,31
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatases
are induced by steroid action, and this again is counterregulated by MIF, which is essential in down-regulation
of MAK kinase activation.32
In tumorigenesis, chronic inflammation may be
essential, as it is known to be in several diseases such as
Cancer

gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori, ulcerous colitis, the development of colon cancer, and several other pathologies.
In the case of MIF, long-term activation of the MIF signaling receptor CD44 seems important. Furthermore, in
a breast cancer model by Bourguignon, invasiveness
depended on this chronic activation.33
In summary, it is essential to recognize that MIF
plays a proinflammatory role in the acute inflammatory
setting, whereas in tumor development, MIF seems to
mediate a chronic inflammatory response, thereby reducing acute inflammation and cell killing.
Within the brain, MIF mRNA is found mainly
within the cell body, whereas the protein itself is located
in the axons, thus suggesting the presence of a transport
mechanism. Within glial cells, there appears to be a rather
homogenous distribution of MIF mRNA but a marked
difference in mRNA levels, which are lower in glial cells
compared with neurons.22 By using immunohistochemistry, the presence of a strong signal was found within glioblastoma cells, especially around necrotic areas and in
close proximity to blood vessels.34

MIF and Tumor
In addition to its proinflammatory action, MIF has also
exhibited proneoplastic activity.16 In many tumor cells
and pretumor states, increased MIF mRNA levels have
been detected, for example, in prostate cancer,13 colon
cancer,14 hepatocellular cancer,35 adenocarcinoma of the
lung,36 glioblastoma,34 and melanoma.17 Why MIF
expression is increased in these tumors is currently being
investigated, although it is commonly accepted that MIF
plays several significant roles in this process.
One reason for the proneoplastic effect of MIF is its
direct proliferative influence on the cell. This was shown
in vitro for recombinant MIF in fibroblasts, in which
stimulation of these cells with growth factor led to
increased MIF concentrations, activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-MAP kinase pathway,
and subsequent increases in cell proliferation.37 This was
also shown in a colon cancer cell line, where the addition
of transforming growth factor-b resulted in increased
MIF expression.19
In addition, MIF is capable of inducing angiogenesis. It has been shown that MIF enhances the differentiation of endothelial cells to blood vessels.23,38 Specifically,
2033

Review Article

significant inhibition of angiogenesis in tumor cells has
been detected using antisense mRNA against MIFdirected antibodies. Furthermore, there is evidence that
MIF may modulate vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) functioning. In glioblastoma cells, it has been
demonstrated that increased MIF expression is induced
after hypoxia and hypoglycemia, both of which are considered classical activators of angiogenesis.34 Similarly,
Hira et al demonstrated increased MIF expression and
angiogenesis after hypoxia in hepatocellular carcinomas.35
Moreover, Kim has published evidence of MIF’s ability to
enhance angiogenesis by comparing MIF levels in blood
and synovial fluid in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
In this study, he established a correlation between MIF
and VEGF concentration. In addition, Kim et al observed
increased production of VEGF upon addition of recombinant MIF to fibroblasts in cell culture.39
One other potential mechanism underlying the proneoplastic effect of MIF is the inhibition of p53 and the
resulting reduction in cell death by apoptosis. This effect
was shown in endothelial cells, in which the antiapoptotic
action of MIF was a result of PI3/Akt signaling.38 These
data were confirmed by Lue et al in a study in which MIF
was shown to promote cell survival by activation of the
Akt pathway.40
In addition, the ERK activation and induction pathways for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are both expressed in
colon carcinoma and are believed to be essential.41 Furthermore, there is evidence that blocking COX with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduces the likelihood
of tumor development by inhibiting the tautomerase activity of MIF.42 This fact was confirmed by data from a
case control study of several different types of solid
tumors, in which the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors
resulted in a significant risk reduction for breast cancer,
prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer and an
overall risk reduction of 68% for all 4 cancers.43 (The activation of the different intracellular pathways by MIF is
summarized in Fig. 2.)
Apte et al have demonstrated that MIF inhibits the
lysis of melanoma cells by NK cells, indicating that MIF
may influence the immune system and enhance proliferation of tumor cells.21 Abe et al have shown that the number of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes increases after MIF
inhibition by means of specific antibodies.44 In addition,
the number of apoptotic tumor cells increases after MIF

inhibition. Given that these cytotoxic cells provide an efficient means of tumor defense, it seems possible that modulation of the immune system by MIF will contribute to
its proneoplastic activity.
Further evidence of the role of MIF in tumor progression was provided by Taylor et al in 2007.45 This
group examined invasive bladder cancer in MIF knockout
mice and found a correlation between invasiveness of the
cancer and MIF mRNA levels, thus providing further evidence that MIF is an essential cytokine in tumor progression as well as tumorigenesis. Furthermore, Wilson et al
demonstrated that MIF is up-regulated in tumors as well
as precancerous lesions.41 Colon adenomas were examined in patients with sporadically occurring adenomas as
well as in a mouse model of adenomatous polyposis coli.
They described an increase in MIF mRNA levels as compared with normal colon mucosa in both humans and
mice. Homozygous deletion of MIF in a mouse model of
intestinal tumorigenesis led to a decrease in the size of the
adenomas and reduced angiogenesis.
MIF expression may also be correlated with the
prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma,35 colon cancer,14
and prostate cancer.46 Specifically, Meyer-Siegler et al
compared serum MIF levels and total PSA.46 This analysis
revealed that MIF concentration is increased in prostate
cancer with a Gleason score of >5. They also found that,
in patients with a prostate-specific antigen count <2 ng/
dL and proven prostate cancer, MIF concentration is
increased. On the basis of their data, they concluded that
MIF may be useful as a biomarker for prostate cancer.
Kamimura et al also obtained interesting data
regarding MIF and its relation to prognosis.36 They used
immunofluorescence staining of primary lung adenocarcinomas that had been surgically removed. This revealed a
primarily diffuse staining pattern within the cytoplasm,
although in several cases nuclear staining could be
detected. The authors identified a correlation between a
lack of nuclear staining and a poorer prognosis. Therefore,
the authors concluded that MIF might fulfill different
functions with respect to its subcellular localization. However, this study should be regarded with caution because
only 38 cases were included. In addition, the nuclear
localization in this study was determined only by standard
immunohistochemistry, despite the finding that this technique does not allow for a clear distinction between nuclear and perinuclear localization.

MIF and Brain Tumors
MIF and angiogenesis

MIF has been shown to be involved in several fundamental processes of tumorigenesis, such as angiogenesis
and cell cycle regulation. However, to our knowledge, the
exact mechanisms by which it is involved have not yet
been elucidated in sufficient detail. MIF is known to promote angiogenesis in glioblastomas and to be up-regulated (in both mRNA and protein levels) when glioma
cells are subject to either hypoxia or hypoglycemia.34 By
using immunofluorescence techniques, MIF was detected
in close association with necrotic tissue and in blood vessels surrounding tumor cells. It was concluded that MIF
expression might be involved in the neovascularization of
glial tumors. In line with this argumentation, Ogawa et al
used MIF antibodies in a tumor model of colon cancer
and reported the suppression of angiogenesis in these
cells.47 By using a B-cell lymphoma model Chesney found
that treatment with MIF antibodies resulted in reduced
tumor growth and vasculature.23
Ren et al found that levels of secreted VEGF
increased with increasing MIF expression in both neuroblastoma tissue and cell lines. They concluded that MIF is
involved in the up-regulation of angiogenic factors contributing to tumor growth and metastasis.48 Munaut et al
demonstrated that MIF expression in human glioblastomas is correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor
expression. They examined 35 glioblastomas with reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of MIF and VEGF and
detected a strong correlation between the expression of
MIF and VEGF and mRNA level,49 suggesting a common triggering event or regulatory pathway. One of these
pathways may be inactivation of p53, a common event in
glioblastoma progression and a pathway that has also been
shown to increase VEGF expression.50 Because the ability
of a tumor to metastasize and avoid starvation directly
depends on its angiogenic potential, MIF may provide a
potential target for antitumor therapy. Further evidence
for a role of MIF in regulating tumor cell migration and
inducing angiogenesis was provided by Ren et al.51 They
examined hepatocellular carcinoma cells and were able to
show that recombinant MIF was able to induce migration
of tumor cells. Interestingly, these effects were blocked by
addition of MIF-specific monoclonal antibodies. Because
Cancer

interleukin (IL)-8 and VEGF are known to promote tumor growth and metastasis, the group found that higher
serum levels of MIF correlated with higher levels of IL-8
as compared with normal controls. The authors also
examined the effects of MIF therapy on the expression of
VEGF and IL-8 expression and observed a dose-dependent increase. The role of MIF in tumor cell migration was
further analyzed by Sun et al,52 who used small interfering
RNA (siRNA) technique in a colon cancer cell line and
observed inhibition of cell migration in vitro after addition of siRNA. When colon cancer cells pretreated with
siRNA were injected into portal veins of mice, the incidence of liver metastasis was found to be significantly
reduced. Finally, they described the inhibition of rho kinase activation after siRNA application. In summary,
there exists significant evidence that MIF promotes the
expression of angiogenic factors and enhances tumor cell
migration.
Tumor growth and differentiation

Uncontrolled growth and lack of differentiation are
classical features of tumors. Hudson et al hypothesized
that MIF bypasses p53-dependent growth arrest in
TGP53-4 cells.53 Their data provide a rationale for the
proneoplastic effect of MIF in several tumor cells. In this
case, cell proliferation would be enhanced and cell senescence delayed, which in turn enhances the likelihood of
oncogenic mutations.
Further evidence for the role of MIF in brain tumors
was found by using neuroblastoma cells stably transfected
with antisense MIF to compare cell proliferation and metastasis in these cells with that of normal neuroblastoma
cells.54 Ren et al found that antisense MIF leads to markedly reduced neuroblastoma growth and metastasis.
Another publication by the same group examined the role
of MIF in neuroblastoma cell lines.48 Here the investigators found that increased expression of MIF in neuroblastoma cells is closely correlated with the grade of tumor
differentiation (ie, in cases of less differentiation, MIF was
more abundant). They also observed that MIF expression
leads to higher levels of N-myc (at both the mRNA and
protein level).48 N-myc is an oncogenic protein involved
in angiogenesis and cell proliferation.55 Evidence suggests
that it is regulated by the ERK pathway, as inhibition of
MIF leads to reduced N-myc expression. These data are of
clinical relevance because N-myc gene amplification is 1 of

the most important prognostic parameters in neuroblastomas and is strongly correlated with tumor
aggressiveness.56
MIF and surrounding tissue

Cells involved in brain tumor development seem to
include microglia, which have long been ignored in this
context. Microglia can be detected in close proximity to
brain tumor cells and seem to be influenced by cytokines
that are secreted by such tumors. There is growing evidence that microglia also play a role in the immune
response to tumor cells.57 Rossi found that microglia and
macrophages could be detected within gliomas.58 This
accumulation was postulated to be the result of cytokine
secretion by glioma cells,59 and it was demonstrated that
microglia chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), expressed
in gliomas, appears to recruit microglia to brain tumors
in vivo.60 Interestingly, a more aggressive behavior of
these cells in vivo was observed. This appears to be consistent with data obtained by other groups indicating that
MCP expression correlates with tumor grade and
invasiveness.61,62
Within the context of these tumors, there is marked
proliferation of microglia, as shown using immunhistochemistry.63 Because these cells also function as antigenpresenting cells, their abundance in the vicinity of brain
tumors might indicate impaired cellular function. Schartner demonstrated that microglia associated with tumor
cells in rat brains indeed demonstrated an impaired
capacity to up-regulate MHC class II.61 In their studies,
they analyzed the response of rodents to injection with
various cytokines such as interferon and found a reduced
MHC class II induction. This line of argumentation is
consistent with previous observations that microglia function as antigen-presenting cells in gliomas, and that gliomas themselves may suppress the antigen-presenting
capacities of microglia.62 This evidence points to the pivotal role of tumor cells in controlling microglial antigenpresenting ability.
In addition, there is evidence that microglial cells
surrounding glioma in the brain may contribute to tumor
progression and invasion.57 This action is initiated primarily by immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10.
However, because microglia/macrophages also secrete
MIF, this may further enhance tumor progression. For
example, Koda et al examined rats with spinal cord inju2036

ries64 and successfully identified MIF in microglial cells
using in situ hybridization. Interestingly, the time course
of release appeared to differ from other cytokines, as MIF
secretion took place later. From this observation, they
excluded a proinflammatory action of MIF in this setting
and concluded that in this case it is more likely that MIF
may be involved in astrocyte proliferation around the
lesion. MIF has, as demonstrated above, cell proliferation–promoting activity and may therefore be an important player in brain tumorigenesis; when secreted by
activated microglia, it stimulates transformed cells to
grow and thereby accelerates tumor development.

MIF as a Therapeutic Target
As previously mentioned, there is growing evidence for a
role of MIF in angiogenesis and tumor migration. Therefore, it appears to be a suitable drug target. Thus far, evidence has been generated mainly in cell culture models for
effective inhibition of MIF action using specific antibodies. Work by Meyer-Siegler et al9 demonstrated a decrease
in cell proliferation and invasion in a prostate cancer cell
culture model. Interestingly, in these cases both antibodies
against MIF and against its receptor were used. Both
methods were found to be equally effective in blocking
MIF-mediated effects. In addition, a specific small molecule inhibitor of MIF, called ISO-1, was recently developed.65 From their successful use of ISO-1 in a mouse
model of sepsis, they conclude that MIF has therapeutic
potential in inflammatory diseases. However, as described
in this review, MIF is also overexpressed in various human
tumors, and therefore it is most likely that inhibition of
MIF tautomerase activity will eventually be relevant to

cancer therapy. In a study by del Vecchio et al, it was
shown that MIF correlates with tumor differentiation in
untreated prostate cancer. They also observed a difference
in MIF concentration in treated prostate adenocarcinomas, which was insignificant.66 Further evidence for a role
of MIF as a therapeutic target comes from Ogawa et al.47
After inoculation of mice with malignant cells, tumor
growth was inhibited using anti-MIF antibody. In addition, using antibodies directed against MIF, they were
able to demonstrate that angiogenesis was markedly
reduced within the tumor. Similar results were obtained
by Sasaki and coworkers, who used antisense MIF plasmids directly injected into colon cancer cells of mice.
Again, a reduction in tumor size and in vitro proliferation
was observed.67 Therefore, it can be concluded that MIF
is a potential target for tumor therapy.
A summary of the most important findings and
studies regarding MIF is provided in Figure 3. Table 1
lists several tumors in which MIF has been described and
shows the role MIF plays within these tumors.

Summary
MIF was initially described as a factor inhibiting macrophage migration.1 Further studies have demonstrated that
MIF is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. To our
knowledge, the signaling pathways activated by MIF have
not been completely elucidated to date, but recently an
extracellular receptor was found that offers a potential target for pharmaceutical action. There is sufficient evidence
of the role of MIF in tumorigenesis via activation of different intracellular pathways. The involvement of MIF in
both tumorigenesis and autoimmune disorders makes it a

potential target for pharmaceutical inhibition. Research is
currently focused on the generation of small molecules
that inhibit MIF’s action and clinical trials to confirm the
effectiveness of those molecules.
