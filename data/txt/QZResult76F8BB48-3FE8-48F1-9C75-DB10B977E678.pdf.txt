ABSTRACT
Tumor-initiating cells (TICs), a.k.a. cancer stem cells (CSCs), are difficult to
eradicate with conventional approaches to cancer treatment, such as chemo-therapy
and radiation. As a consequence, the survival of residual CSCs is thought to drive
the onset of tumor recurrence, distant metastasis, and drug-resistance, which is
a significant clinical problem for the effective treatment of cancer. Thus, novel
approaches to cancer therapy are needed urgently, to address this clinical need.
Towards this end, here we have investigated the therapeutic potential of graphene
oxide to target cancer stem cells. Graphene and its derivatives are well-known,
relatively inert and potentially non-toxic nano-materials that form stable dispersions
in a variety of solvents. Here, we show that graphene oxide (of both big and small
flake sizes) can be used to selectively inhibit the proliferative expansion of cancer
stem cells, across multiple tumor types. For this purpose, we employed the tumorsphere assay, which functionally measures the clonal expansion of single cancer
stem cells under anchorage-independent conditions. More specifically, we show that
graphene oxide effectively inhibits tumor-sphere formation in multiple cell lines,
across 6 different cancer types, including breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and pancreatic
cancers, as well as glioblastoma (brain). In striking contrast, graphene oxide is nontoxic for “bulk” cancer cells (non-stem) and normal fibroblasts. Mechanistically, we
present evidence that GO exerts its striking effects on CSCs by inhibiting several key
signal transduction pathways (WNT, Notch and STAT-signaling) and thereby inducing
CSC differentiation. Thus, graphene oxide may be an effective non-toxic therapeutic
strategy for the eradication of cancer stem cells, via differentiation-based nanotherapy.

across different tumor types [6-8]. As only a very
small percentage of cancer cells have “stem-like” and
“tumor-initiating” properties, they are difficult to study
and their key distinguishing features remain relatively
uncharacterized, although they appears to resist both
chemo-therapy and radiation.
Interestingly, CSCs share many properties with
normal stem cells, including immortality and resistance
to stress, as well as asymmetric cell division [9, 10]. A
particular distinguishing characteristic of CSCs is their
ability to initiate tumors and to undergo anchorageindependent growth, when cultured in suspension
[11]. Under these particular cell culture conditions,
CSCs proliferate and form 3D-spheroid-like structures,
containing CSCs and progenitor cells, which are known
as “tumor-spheres” or “onco-spheres” [12, 13]. In
striking contrast, the vast majority of non-CSCs undergo
a specialized form of apoptosis in suspension cultures,
called anoikis. Importantly, each 3D-spheroid originates
from the clonal proliferation of a single CSC, is not to due
to the self-aggregation of cancer cells. Thus, tumor-sphere
formation is an efficient means to selectively enrich for
CSCs. The CSC population is resistant to DNA-damage,
and shows lower levels of ROS production, as well [14,
15]. 3D-tumor-spheres derived from breast cancer cells are
also known as mammo-spheres [12, 13].
Clinically, there is an urgent need to identify new
therapeutic strategies for selectively targeting CSCs.
Here, we show that graphene oxide (GO) demonstrates
this selectivity. As such, our current study provides a new
rationale for exploiting graphene oxide itself as an anticancer therapeutic, rather than simply as a drug-delivery
agent [16].

GO flakes target breast cancer stem cells
Here, we tested the efficacy of graphene oxide as a
potential new anti-cancer agent, for the selective targeting
of CSCs. Graphene, described as two-dimensional sheets
of carbon atoms without any additional functional groups,
does not forms stable dispersions in water or other
biologically relevant solvents [17]. On the other hand,
graphene oxide [18] is the water-soluble derivative of
graphene which can be produced with various sizes and
bearing varied functional groups and which can be more
easily manipulated experimentally, especially in biological
systems. Sterile GO dispersions were prepared in a 5%
mixture of DMSO in double-distilled water for these
studies.
Initially, we tested the ability of GO to affect CSC
proliferation, using MCF7 cells, a well-established ER(+)
breast cancer cell line. Two grades of GO were used,
small GO (s-GO) with flake sizes of 0.2–2 µm and big
GO (b-GO) with flake sizes of 5–20 µm, to represent two
size classes, where the flakes are either smaller or larger
than the target cells (Figure 1). For this purpose, we
assessed the effects of graphene oxide on the anchorageindependent clonal expansion of MCF7 CSCs, using
the tumor-sphere assay. This functional assay directly
measures CSCs proliferative expansion [12]. Figure 2
shows the results of this analysis. Using s-GO flakes, we
observed a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor-sphere
formation, in the range of 1.25 to 25 µg/ml, with an IC-

GO-based mechanistic studies: Effects on wellestablished CSC signaling pathways

Table 1: Six Cancer Cell Models with Broad
Applicability.

To gain mechanistic insights into how GO flakes
target cancer stem cells, we next analyzed their effects on
a series of well-established signal transduction pathways,
which have been shown to contribute towards “stemness”
[21-23].
For this purpose, we used a panel of MCF7 cell
lines that were stably-transfected with different luciferase
reporters, that allows one to quantitatively measure the
activation-state of a given signal transduction pathway.
Interestingly, Figure 7 shows that a number of signaling
pathways were significantly inhibited by GO treatment.
More specifically, GO treatment inhibited WNT- and
Notch-driven signaling, as well as STAT1/3 signaling and
the NRF2-dependent anti-oxidant response. However,
little or no effect was observed on TGF-beta/SMAD-

50 of ~12.5 µg/ml. Similarly, using b-GO flakes, we also
observed a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor-sphere
formation, in the range of 6.25 to 100 µg/ml, again with
an IC-50 of ~12.5 µg/ml. Importantly, both small and big
GO flakes did not affect the viability of the bulk non-CSC
population of MCF7 cells, indicating selectivity towards
CSCs (Figure 2).

GO flakes target CSCs, across multiple cancer
types
Since both the small and big GO flakes showed
similar potency, we focused more on evaluating the
efficacy of b-GO flakes. We next evaluated whether GO
also showed efficacy against CSCs from multiple cancer
types, such as ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and lung
cancers, as well as glioblastoma (brain) (the six cell lines
tested are summarized in Table 1). For simplicity, we
tested b-GO flakes at two doses, namely 25 and 50 µg/ml.
Figure 3 shows that b-GO flakes also effectively
inhibited tumor-sphere formation in these 5 other
cell lines. Thus, our results indicate that GO must be
targeting a relatively specific and highly-conserved
phenotypic property of CSCs, across multiple cancer
types. Representative images of tumor-sphere inhibition
by GO treatment are shown in Figure 4. Interestingly, the
viability of bulk non-CSCs from these five cancer cell
lines (SKOV3, PC3, A549, Mia PaCa2, and U-87) was
not affected by GO (Figure 5), further highlighting its
specificity and selectivity for CSCs.
Importantly, b-GO flakes also did not affect the
viability of a normal skin fibroblast cell line (hTERTBJ1), indicating that GO is relatively non-toxic for normal
body cells (Figure 6). This is consistent with the findings
of many other laboratories, i.e., that GO is non-toxic for
multiple normal cell types [19, 20].

Thus, it appears that GO treatment somehow targets

cells, to reduce overall “stemness”.

by FACS analysis. The results of these studies are
presented in Figure 8.
Briefly, MCF7 cells were treated as monolayer
cultures with GO (50μg/ml) for 48 hours or left untreated
(vehicle alone control). Then, cells were trypsinized and
plated on low-attachment plates for 10 hours to induce
anoikis and enrich for CSCs. Single cells were then
analysed by FACS to quantitate the CD44(+)CD24-/
low population, which represents the breast CSCs. As
predicted, the CD44(+)CD24-/low population is greatly
enriched after 10 hours in low-attachment conditions

GO promotes the differentiation of breast cancer
stem cells
To further validate the idea GO was reducing
stemness in MCF7-derived CSCs, we used a series of
well-established breast cancer stem cell markers (CD44

variety of signaling networks, including Wnt, STAT3, Notch, NRF2-dependent antioxidant responses, Interferonγ-STAT1 and SMADTGFβ pathways. MCF7-Luc reporter cells were treated with GO (big flakes) for 48 hours and luminescence was determined as a measure
of pathway activation status. Note that GO inhibits cancer stem cell signaling (WNT, STAT3 and Notch), NRF2-antioxidant responses, as
well as INFΥ-STAT1 signaling. No effects were observed for the SMAD-TGFβ-pathway. An * indicates p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01

low population is greatly enriched after 10 hours in low-attachment conditions (vehicle alone control). B. Interestingly, GO does not reduce
the total number of anoikis-resistant cells (data not shown), but rather induces the expression of CD24, thereby significantly reducing the
CD44(+)CD24-/low population. This suggests that GO inhibits mammosphere formation by promoting the differentiation of breast cancer
stem cells. An * indicates p < 0.05 (Student’s t-test).

(vehicle alone control) (Figure 8A).
Interestingly, GO does not reduce the total number
of anoikis-resistant cells (data not shown), but rather
induces the expression of CD24, thereby significantly
reducing the CD44(+)CD24-/low population (Figure 8B).
This suggests that GO inhibits mammosphere formation
by promoting the differentiation of breast cancer stem
cells, supporting our results from the analysis of multiple
signal transduction pathways

Thus, GO may reduce the number of bonafide CSCs that
are capable of forming tumor-spheres, by inducing their
differentiation and inhibiting their proliferation. However,
additional mechanistic studies are clearly warranted.
Importantly, our preliminary results indicate that
GO treatment does not significantly affect oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in this context
(data not shown), suggesting that GO does not target
mitochondria. This is in contrast to our previous studies
where a number of mitochondrially-targeted FDAapproved antibiotics effectively eradiated CSCs [24].
Thus, GO and mitochondrially-targeted antibiotics appear
to work differently, via separate and distinct molecular
mechanism(s).
Also, since b-GO flakes are 5-to-20µm in size,
they must be exerting their effects at the cell surface, as
they are too large to be internalized within cells and are
actually larger than a single cell. This is consistent with
our findings that GO-treatment dampens the activation of
several stem cell associated signal transduction pathways,
which are initiated at the cell surface. This could then
mechanistically induce CSC differentiation, which we
observed experimentally (summarized in Figure 9).
Previous studies have shown that GO (or its related
derivatives) can inhibit “bulk” cancer cell migration
or prevent tumor growth in xenograft models [25-28].
However, none of these studies connected GO treatment
to the CSC phenotype or indicated that it could be used for
“differentiation” therapy.

DISCUSSION
Here, we show that treatment with GO is sufficient
to inhibit tumor-sphere formation in six independent
cancer cell lines, across multiple tumor types (breast,
ovarian, prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancer, as well
glioblastoma (brain cancer)). These results suggest that
GO specifically targets a global phenotypic property of
CSCs that is highly conserved in multiple tumor types.
Moreover, using MCF7 cells expressing a panel of
luciferase reporters, we observed that GO treatment was
indeed sufficient to inhibit a number of different signal
transduction pathways, including WNT, Notch, STAT1/3
and NRF-2, but did not effect TGB-beta/SMAD signaling.
Finally, using a panel of specific well-established breast
CSC markers (namely CD44 and CD24), we show that
GO appears to reduce the number of CSCs by inducing
their differentiation, as they now begin to express CD24.

Figure 9: Graphene oxide (GO): Targeting cancer stem cells with differentiation-based nano-therapy. Our current
mechanistic studies suggest that GO could directly be used as a therapeutic for targeting CSCs, because of its ability to induce differentiation.
In this context, we might envision that GO could used to clear residual CSCs, with the aim of preventing tumor recurrence and distant
metastasis, thereby providing a practical means for achieving “differentiation-based nano-therapy”.

Interestingly, several studies have shown that
GO is non-toxic for normal stem cells, and indeed GO
promotes their differentiation. More specifically, it was
demonstrated that culturing normal pluripotent stem cells
on GO as a substrate induces their terminal differentiation
towards multiple cell lineages, including neurons,
chondrocytes and adipocytes [29-33]. These properties are
currently being actively exploited for tissue engineering
and regenerative medicine, by using GO as a scaffold for
bone reconstruction and neural regeneration.
Our new mechanistic studies suggest that GO could
directly be used as a therapeutic for targeting CSCs,
possibly as a differentiation agent. In this context, we
envision that GO could be delivered i.v. or p.o., as a new
anti-cancer therapeutic, depending on the location of
the tumor. Alternatively, GO flakes could also be used
as a lavage solution during surgery, to clear the tumor
excision site or the peritoneal cavity (as in ovarian or
other peritoneal cancers) of residual CSCs, with the aim
of preventing tumor recurrence and distant metastasis, via
differentiation-based nano-therapy (Figure 9).

Tumor-sphere culture

MATERIALS & METHODS

The Cignal Lenti reporter assay (luc) system
(Qiagen) was chosen for monitoring the activity of
several signal transduction pathways in MCF7 cells.
The responsive luciferase constructs encode the firefly
luciferase reporter gene under the control of a minimal (m)
CMV promoter and tandem repeats of response elements
for each pathway. The following constructs were used:
TCF/LEF(luc) for Wnt signal transduction (CLS-018L);
STAT3(luc) for transcriptional activity of STAT3 (CLS6028L); RBP-Jk(luc) for Notch-induced signaling (CLS014L); ARE(luc) for Nrf2- and Nrf1-mediated antioxidant
response (CLS-2020L); GAS(luc) for Interferon
gamma-induced Stat1-signal transduction (CLS-009L);
SMAD(luc) for TGFβ-induced signal transduction (CLS017L). Briefly, 1 x 105 MCF7-GFP cells were seeded in
12-well plates. Once cells were attached, the viral particles
were diluted 1:10 in complete culture media containing
polybrene (sc-134220, Santa Cruz), and added to the cells.
Puromycin treatment (P9620, Sigma) was started 48 hours
later in order to select stably infected cells.

A single cell suspension was prepared using
enzymatic (1x Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma Aldrich, #T3924),
and manual disaggregation (25 gauge needle) to create a
single cell suspension. Cells were plated at a density of
500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium (DMEM-F12/
B27/20ng/ml EGF/PenStrep) in non-adherent conditions,
in culture dishes coated with (2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)
(poly-HEMA, Sigma, #P3932) [12]. Cells were grown for
5 days and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C
at an atmospheric pressure in 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide/
air. After 5 days for culture, spheres >50 μ were counted
using an eye graticule, and the percentage of tumorsphere formation was normalized to 100% for vehicle
alone control (1 = 100 % TSF) [12]. All experiments were
performed in triplicate, three times independently, such
that each data point represents the average of 9 replicates.

Evaluation of CSC signalling pathways

Materials
Cancer cell lines were purchased from the ATCC or
other commercially available sources. Gibco-brand cell
culture media (DMEM/F12) was purchased from Life
Technologies.

Graphene oxide
Graphene oxide was prepared by using the Hummers
method with modifications [34, 35]. The individual
graphite oxide flakes contain carboxyl groups mainly
at the edges, and epoxide, hydroxide and ketone groups
mainly on the basal plane. The C to O ratio is usually
slightly lower or slightly higher than 1 as determined by
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The graphene oxide
flakes of different sizes were separated by centrifuging
graphene oxide suspensions at various rpm and
collecting different phases of the suspension. The AFM
characterization of graphene oxide flakes was performed
on a Bruker Dimension FastScan AFM system by using
taping mode. The substrates were prepared by spin-casting
the suspension on a Si/SiO2 substrate to yield monolayer
film, followed by AFM imaging. Concentrations were
obtained from UV-Vis spectra, which were recorded in 10
mm path length quartz cells using a PerkinElmer Lambda
– 1050 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. The dispersions were
diluted to give the absorption intensity lower than 1.

Luciferase assays
The Luciferase Assay System (E1501, Promega Kit)
was used on all luciferase reporter MCF7 cells treated
with GO. Briefly, 6 × 103 MCF7-GFP cells were seeded
in black-walled 96-well plates and then were treated with
GO (50 μg/ml). As controls, vehicle-treated cells were run
in parallel. Four replicates were used for each condition.
After 48 hours of treatment, luciferase assays were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Light signal was acquired for 2 minutes in photons/second
in the Xenogen VivoVision IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life

Sciences), and the results were analysed using Living
Image 3.2 sofware (Caliper Life Sciences). Luminescence
was normalized using SRB (to determine total cellular
protein), as a measure of MCF7 cell viability.

Following GO treatment, the CSC population was
enriched by seeding on low-attachment plates. Under
these conditions, the non-CSCs undergo anoikis (a form of
apoptosis induced by lack of proper attachment) and CSCs
are believed to survive. The expression of differentiation
markers by the surviving “CSC fraction” was analyzed by
FACS analysis. Briefly, 1 x 104 MCF7 cells were treated
with GO (50μg/ml) for 48h in 6-well plates, grown as a
monolayer. Then, the monolayer cells were trypsinized and
seeded in low-attachment plates in mammosphere media.
After 10h under low-attachment conditions, MCF7 cells
were spun down and incubated with CD24 (IOTest CD24PE, Beckman Coulter) and CD44 (APC mouse AntiHuman CD44, BD Pharmingen cat.559942) antibodies for
15 minutes on ice. Cells were rinsed twice and incubated
with LIVE/DEAD dye (Fixable Dead Violet reactive dye;
Invitrogen) for 10 minutes. Samples were then analyzed
by FACS (Fortessa, BD Bioscence). Only the live
population, as identified by the LIVE/DEAD dye staining,
was analyzed for CD24/CD44 expression. Data were
analysed using FlowJo software. Virtually identical results
were also obtained using 7-AAD (7-Aminoactinomycin
D; Life Technologies) to distinguish between the live and
dead populations of cells (cell viability), during anoikis.
