BACKGROUND: Dabrafenib has activity in patients with brain metastases, but little is known of the relative efficacy of treatment
within and outside the brain. This study sought to examine the intracranial (IC) and extracranial (EC) patterns of response and progression in patients with active melanoma brain metastases treated with dabrafenib. METHODS: Clinicopathologic parameters were
collected on patients with active brain metastases enrolled in the phase 1 and 2 studies of dabrafenib at a single institution. RECIST
(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) response and progression-free survival (PFS) were prospectively assessed by disease
site (IC versus EC). Treatments received after disease progression were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were studied.
Response rates were similar in IC (78%) and EC (90%) sites (P 5.416). IC and EC response was concordant in 71% of patients. Median
site-specific PFS was identical in both IC and EC sites (23.6 weeks, P 5.465), and exceeded whole-body PFS determined by RECIST
(16.3 weeks). Of 20 patients with progressive disease (PD), 6 had IC PD only, 6 had EC PD only, and 8 had PD in both sites. In those
with isolated intracranial PD, 5 of 6 underwent local therapy to the brain and continued on dabrafenib longer than 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: IC and EC melanoma metastases respond similarly to dabrafenib. There is no dominant site or pattern of disease progression
in patients with brain metastases treated with dabrafenib. Salvage local therapy is possible in most patients after IC disease progresC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma commonly metastasizes to the brain. Twenty percent of patients have brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV
disease,1 and approximately 50% ultimately develop them through the course of disease.2 They occur more frequently in
those with BRAF -mutant than BRAF wild-type melanoma.1 Brain metastases carry a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 3 to 5 months from diagnosis, contributing to death in up to 50% of patients.2,3 Surgery and radiotherapy can
provide local control and improvement in neurological symptoms in those with limited disease,4 but until the availability
of selective BRAF inhibitors, systemic therapies had limited efficacy, with response rates of no more than 10%.2,4-8
BRAF inhibitors have significant activity in patients with melanoma brain metastases, as seen in the phase 1 and 2
clinical trials of dabrafenib9,10 and the pilot study of vemurafenib.11 The phase 2 trial of dabrafenib in 172 patients with
progressing brain metastases with or without prior local treatment demonstrated an intracranial (IC) response rate of 30%
to 40%, an IC disease control rate of > 80%, a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.1 and 16.6 weeks in 2
cohorts, and a median overall survival (OS) of 33.1 and 31.4 weeks in the same cohorts of BRAFV600E (Val600Glu substitution in BRAF) metastatic melanoma patients. Although this study demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in patients with

both untreated and previously treated brain metastases, it
did not report data regarding the extracranial (EC)
response to therapy in patients on the trial, nor did it
examine the degree of concordance of response to therapy
within individual patients (IC versus EC). No studies to
date have examined the nature of disease progression in
patients with brain metastases treated with BRAF inhibitors, nor have they examined treatments received
afterward.
There are now several strategies for the management
of brain metastases in patients with metastatic melanoma,
including surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and
BRAF inhibitors. In order to assist with the translation of
clinical trial data into effective patient care, particularly
for patients with IC and EC disease at the time of first diagnosis of metastatic disease, it is critical to understand
the comparative IC and EC tumor response to BRAF inhibition, the nature of disease progression, and the effective management of patients after intracranial disease
progression. In this study, we sought to analyze the nature
of IC and EC response and progression in patients with
melanoma brain metastases treated with dabrafenib, and
hypothesized that IC and EC metastases respond and progress similarly to BRAF inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

The study was undertaken at Westmead Hospital in association with the Melanoma Institute of Australia (NSW,
Australia), with Human Research Ethics Committee approval and patient informed consent. All patients who
were enrolled in the brain cohort of the phase 1 trial9 and
the phase 2 brain metastasis trial (BREAK-MB)10 of dabrafenib at Westmead Hospital between September 2009
and June 2011 were assessed. Patients were eligible for
enrollment if they had BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K metastatic melanoma as assessed by high-resolution melt analysis and sequencing (phase 1 trial), or trial-specific
polymerase chain reaction–based test (phase 2 trial), and
either: 1) untreated, or 2) progressive but previously
locally treated asymptomatic brain metastases (progression in the brain was determined using RECIST
[Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors] version
1.0 for the phase 1 trial or modified RECIST version 1.1
in the phase 2 trial).12,13 Previous local brain treatment
included surgery, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or a combination of local
therapies. At least 1 measurable IC lesion ( 0.3 cm and
 4 cm for the phase 1 trial,  0.5 cm and  4 cm for the

phase 2 trial) as determined by gadolinium-enhanced
magnetic resolution imaging (MRI) was required for trial
entry. Concomitant corticosteroids were permitted if at a
stable or reducing dose, and prophylactic or preventative
antiepileptic therapy was allowed. Patients were allowed
up to 2 lines of prior systemic treatment excluding
mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors and were
required to have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
BRAF Inhibitor Treatment

All patients were treated with dabrafenib at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 150 mg twice daily
(bid), except for one patient on the phase 1 trial who commenced 70 mg bid and was escalated to the RP2D after
12 weeks. Patients with progressive disease (PD), defined
as either IC, EC, or overall (as per RECIST criteria), were
allowed to continue on dabrafenib if deemed to have
ongoing clinical benefit from this treatment, including after local therapies (surgery, radiotherapy).
Disease Assessments

Baseline demographics including patient age, sex, BRAF
genotype, the date of diagnosis of stage IV disease, and diagnosis of first brain metastasis, as well as details of prior
brain metastasis treatment were collected. Baseline clinicopathologic parameters examining the patient’s burden
of disease including lactate dehydrogenase level and
RECIST sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions (IC,
EC, and overall total [SoD of IC and EC]). In addition,
computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans were
reviewed, and the sites of EC metastases as well as the total
number of IC and EC metastases were collected. The
number and site of EC metastases were recorded, and
patients with 20 IC metastases were classified into
groups (20-30, 30-40, 40-50 metastases).
Disease assessments performed during treatment
included clinical assessment every 4 weeks and imaging
studies (cerebral MRI and chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT
scans) at week 4, week 8, and every 8 weeks thereafter.
RECIST criteria (version 1.0 for the phase 1 trial, version
1.1 for the phase 2 trial)12,13 were used to determine disease response extracranially, and modified RECIST10 was
used to assess intracranial response. Overall response was
determined by combining the RECIST SoD of target
lesions at both IC and EC sites.10 Concordance of IC and
EC response was defined as either partial/complete
response (PR/CR, IC, and EC), stable disease (SD, IC,
and EC), or progressive disease (PD, IC, and EC). We
determined disease progression at IC and EC sites

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Twenty-three patients were included for analysis, and
baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Twelve
patients (52%) had no prior local treatment for brain metastases, and 11 patients (48%) had received prior local
treatment with subsequent disease progression intracranially. These groups were not analyzed separately due to the
small patient numbers and unbalanced baseline characteristics. Patients had a median of 4 IC and 10 EC metastases, with a median RECIST SoD of 17 mm (IC) and 85
mm (EC) at baseline. One patient had no EC disease at
trial entry, and another had EC disease that was not
RECIST-measurable, and neither were included for EC
response assessment. The median number of EC sites was
4 with a range of 1 to 8 sites, reflecting variable burden of
EC disease.

the earliest progressing site (IC or EC) and not the overall

Statistical Methods

All statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS
Statistic, version 19.0. Univariate survival analyses were
conducted with the Kaplan-Meier method together with
the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test for statistical significance
of categorical variables. Cox regression was used to test
survival for continuous variables. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. PFS was defined as the
time interval in days from commencement of dabrafenib
to the first date of progression intracranially (IC PFS),
532

extracranially (EC PFS), or overall (overall PFS, defined
as PFS of the first progressing site). In those with PD in either IC or EC sites alone who continued on dabrafenib
treatment beyond progression for ongoing clinical benefit, PFS for the other site was calculated. OS was defined
as the time interval in days from commencement of dabrafenib to the date of last follow-up or death. All patient
deaths in this cohort were attributed to melanoma.

The overall, IC, and EC response rates, and PFS as well as
OS, are shown in Table 2. The overall response rate was
87% (20 of 23 patients), with median time to best
response of 7.7 weeks, median PFS of 16.3 weeks, and
median OS of 36.6 weeks. IC and EC response rates were
similar at 78% (18 of 23 patients) and 90% (19 of 21
patients), respectively (P 5 .416). There was a trend toward shorter time to best response in the IC compared
with EC sites (median 7.4 versus 12.4 weeks, P 5 .107).
The median PFS was similar in IC and EC sites (23.6
weeks each, P 5 .465).
Intrapatient IC and EC Concordance of
Response

For those with measurable IC and EC disease at baseline
as per RECIST (N 5 21), IC and EC best RECIST
response category was concordant (ie, PR/CR IC and EC;
SD IC and EC; or PD IC and EC) in 15 (71%) patients.
The degree of response was also similarly concordant
(Fig. 1). Only one patient had tumor growth in EC disease (although still classified as stable disease) with shrinkage in IC disease.

treatment prior to trial entry (surgery and WBRT) and the
lesions were not amenable to further therapy. Five of the 6
patients continued on dabrafenib for > 30 days after progression, with one patient continuing on treatment for 39
weeks after surgery to an isolated progressing IC lesion. In
those who progressed at both IC and EC sites (N 5 8) (Table 3), 4 received salvage local therapy to IC metastases and
3 patients continued on dabrafenib (> 30 days) after progression. In patients with isolated EC progression (N 5 6),
4 continued on dabrafenib (> 30 days) after progression.
In total, 14 patients had IC progression (isolated or
in combination with EC progression). Five patients
underwent SRS/surgery, another 5 patients underwent
WBRT, and further treatment of the progressing lesion(s)
was not possible in the remaining 4 patients. In the SRS/
surgery group, the median duration of dabrafenib continuation beyond progression was 11 weeks (range, 5-39
weeks) (Table 3).

Dabrafenib and Melanoma Brain Metastases/Azer et al

DISCUSSION
Several trials have demonstrated BRAF inhibitors are
active in patients with melanoma brain metastases.9-11 To
the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to assess the
nature of IC and EC response and progression in patients
with melanoma brain metastases treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Results from this study of dabrafenib treatment
suggest that IC and EC melanoma metastases respond in a
concordant manner, with high response rates and similar
PFS. Disease progression in those with brain metastases
treated with dabrafenib is heterogeneous, and the brain is
not necessarily the site of treatment failure in patients
with active brain metastases at start of treatment. The
results of this study are strengthened by the inclusion of
patients with a broad spectrum of IC and EC disease burden, the detailed assessment of both IC and EC disease
during treatment, and the inclusion of multiple clinicopathologic parameters for analysis.
The median PFS and OS seen in this study (16 and
36 weeks, respectively) are similar to those reported in the
BREAK-MB trial10 (16 and 32 weeks, respectively), suggesting that the patients included in this study are a representative subgroup of the phase 2 trial. The response rates
in both IC and EC sites observed in this study are higher
than those previously reported in trials,9,10,14,15 potentially due to the bias introduced by the single radiologist
reporting every scan. This bias affected assessment of both
IC and EC sites in equal measure, however, and therefore
should not have significantly influenced comparative
response assessments.
Our data show that disease control in the brain is similar to that in EC sites, and the IC and EC “site-specific”
PFS was the same (median, 23 weeks). “Whole body” PFS,
however, was shorter (median, 16 weeks). The explanation
for this is that site-specific PFS only measures a subset of
the total disease. Almost a third of patients progressed in
EC sites with ongoing IC disease control. Overall, this is an
important illustration of the fact that formal “whole body”
RECIST reporting of studies of patients with brain metastases may underrepresent the rate of disease control in the
brain. This could also explain the shorter PFS in BREAKMB (median, 16 weeks) compared to that reported for
studies of dabrafenib in patients with exclusively EC disease
(5-6 months).9,14,15
After IC disease progression, local treatment to progressing lesions with concurrent ongoing dabrafenib treatment was used in several patients. This “salvage” local
treatment enabled many patients to remain on dabrafenib
treatment for control of the remainder of their disease, particularly in those with isolated progression amenable to SRS.
Cancer

February 15, 2014

The heterogeneous nature of disease progression
observed in this study, and the availability and success of
local therapies to treat isolated areas of progression, demonstrate that RECIST-defined progression does not
always mean treatment failure. Unlike chemotherapy, this
phenomenon is particularly true for targeted therapies in
general, regardless of the type of malignancy they are used
to treat, and ceasing treatment at RECIST progression
may lead to early cessation of treatment that may still be
beneficial to the patient.16
In metastatic melanoma, the approach of switching
to immunotherapy (eg, ipilimumab) after BRAF inhibitor
disease progression has been shown to have little efficacy
in retrospective studies,17,18 particularly if patients have
brain metastases, whereas ongoing treatment with BRAF
inhibitors beyond progression may have a survival advantage.19,20 No prospective studies have assessed this issue,
however, and novel treatments such as PD-1 antibodies
may have superior efficacy in this setting.
The management approach to patients with melanoma brain metastases is complicated and changing rapidly.
Results of this study suggest that brain metastases respond
and progress similarly to EC metastases in patients treated
with dabrafenib, and this should assist with choices regarding the nature and timing of local and systemic treatments.
Although a prospective clinical trial sequencing local and
targeted therapies for patients with brain metastases is
required to clarify the general treatment algorithm, a multidisciplinary approach remains critical to ensure optimal outcomes for patients with melanoma brain metastases.
