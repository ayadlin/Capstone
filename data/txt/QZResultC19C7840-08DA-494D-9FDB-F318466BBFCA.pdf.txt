BACKGROUND: Involuntary weight loss is a major contributor to mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced
cancer. Nutritional intervention with fish oil (FO)-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may prevent deterioration of
body composition. This study compared intervention with FO with standard of care (SOC; no intervention) with
regard to weight, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue in newly referred patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer from
the time of initiation to completion of first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty patients completed the study; there
were 16 in the FO group (dose of 2.2 g of EPA/day) and 24 patients in the SOC group. Skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue were measured using computed tomography images. Blood was collected and weight was recorded at baseline and throughout chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients in the SOC group experienced an average weight loss of 2.3 
0.9 kg whereas patients receiving FO maintained their weight (0.5  1.0 kg) (P ¼ .05). Patients with the greatest
increase in plasma EPA concentration after FO supplementation were found to have the greatest gains in muscle (r2
¼ 0.55; P ¼ .01). Approximately 69% of patients in the FO group gained or maintained muscle mass. Comparatively,
only 29% of patients in the SOC group maintained muscle mass, and overall the SOC group lost 1 kg of muscle. No
difference in total adipose tissue was observed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional intervention with
2.2 g of FO per day appears to provide a benefit over SOC, resulting in the maintenance of weight and muscle mass

Involuntary weight loss is common among patients with advanced cancer, contributing to poor treatment response,

functional decline, and decreased survival.1 Supplementation with >2 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been
shown to stabilize weight loss,2 attenuate lean tissue wasting,3 and increase survival4 in patients with advanced cancer.
Conversely, 3 large phase 3 trials have failed to demonstrate a clear benefit of EPA with regard to body weight or lean tissue
in cancer patients.5-7 Possible reasons for this discordance are the time of the initiation of intervention, contamination
between treatment arms, and indirect assessments of muscle mass. Studies have focused on patients who are advanced in
the disease trajectory with a short median survival (in the study by Bruera et al,8 the median survival was 14 weeks) and
who are not receiving therapy because of progressive disease.5,6 The results of these trials are difficult to interpret because
of advanced wasting at the time of presentation (ranging from 2% to 56% of body weight) and a large number of early

deaths. Compliance was not reported in 1 study,7 and
other studies have reported contamination of both the
placebo and treatment groups.2,6 In addition, previous
studies have used indirect measures of skeletal muscle
such as prediction of total lean body mass from total body
water,9 skinfolds,8 and bioelectrical impedance,2,5,6 none
of which distinguish skeletal muscle from other lean soft
tissue.
In patients with advanced cancer, an accelerated
gain in lean tissue, including the liver and spleen, has been
observed 3 months before death.10 Therefore, making a
specific distinction between skeletal muscle and other lean
tissue is important. Computed tomography (CT) can precisely quantify skeletal muscle,11 but to the best of our
knowledge has not been previously used to assess the effect
of EPA supplementation on skeletal muscle in patients
with advanced cancer. CT imaging also distinguishes
between different adipose depots (visceral, subcutaneous,
and intermuscular) and was recently used to describe
changes in adipose tissue in patients with advanced cancer,
including accelerated loss of adipose tissue near the time
of death.12 Recently, muscle fat content has been recognized as a negative predictor of muscle strength.13
Increased intermusclar adipose tissue (IMAT) has also
been found to be correlated with poor function14 and an
increased incidence of mobility limitations.14
Patients receiving active treatment may represent an
opportunity for timely nutritional intervention because
side effects from chemotherapy such as nausea, vomiting,
dysphagia, and anorexia often are disabling, and may
impact on body weight and composition. This study
uniquely used early intervention in newly referred patients
with the goal of preventing weight and muscle loss during
chemotherapy. The objective of the current study was to
examine the effect of nutritional intervention with fish oil
(FO) on weight and body composition against standard
of care (SOC) during the course of chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Alberta Health Services
Research Ethics Board. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. At the Cross Cancer Institute
in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, which is 1 of 2 major cancer centers for all of Alberta, all newly referred patients
with lung cancer attend a medical oncology clinic for new
patients. At the clinic, patients are given a brief summary
that describes available nutritional studies and are asked
to indicate studies of interest. Patient response informs

1776

investigators which patients to approach regarding participation in research studies. To minimize bias and the
recruitment of patients who are more motivated about
nutrition into the intervention group, both arms were
described as nutritional studies and patients were offered
information regarding nutrient intake and body composition after the completion of both studies. If patients indicated they were interested in the intervention arm but
subsequently declined to participate, they were not
approached for the SOC arm.
Eligibility Criteria
Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and who were naive to
chemotherapy were eligible for enrolment. We included
patients who were receiving first-line chemotherapy to
maximize the accrual of patients for whom better survival
would be predicted. All patients consented to receive platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with either curative or
palliative intent based on standard practice specifically
agreed on as clinical practice guidelines by the Alberta
Provincial Lung Tumor Group. The duration of study
was at least 6 weeks (2 cycles of chemotherapy). Patients
with a CT image  45 days from the initiation of chemotherapy (mean, 25  3 days) and a second CT image
 45 days after receiving chemotherapy (mean, 21  5
days) were included in the analyses. Because this study
was aimed at preventing body composition changes from
the time of treatment initiation, prior weight loss was not
a criterion but self-reported weight loss within the 6
months preceding enrolment in the study was recorded
from the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment15 or from patient history. Height and weight
recorded on the same day by hospital staff was used for
verification when available.
Study Design
To avoid the challenges of previous studies (contamination between treatment arms and poor compliance), the
current study was designed as an open-label study with a
contemporaneous control group. Patients meeting eligibility criteria consented to either nutritional intervention
with FO or SOC (no intervention). SOC was comprised
of blood draws and anthropometric measurements taken
at the same time points as the FO group. To ensure
patients recruited for the study were representative of the
local advanced lung cancer population, we included a reference group to detail typical baseline characteristics of
patients receiving first-line chemotherapy to provide

information concerning the expected changes in body
composition during chemotherapy. Our research group
has prospectively followed >600 patients with solid
tumors of the lung for whom longitudinal CT images
were available from the time of referral. Patient records
were reviewed for the same inclusion criteria as patients in
the SOC and FO groups: NSCLC diagnosis and naive to
chemotherapy and treatment with first-line, platinumbased doublet chemotherapy. A total of 104 patients met
the inclusion criteria. Subsequently, weight information
was recorded and CT images were analyzed. CT images
were obtained 95  3.8 days apart. A mean of 19.5  1
days elapsed between the initiation of chemotherapy and
the first CT scan, and 18  1.1 days elapsed between the
second CT scan and the last day of chemotherapy.
Because previous studies have reported a benefit
with 2 g of EPA,3,16,17 patients were instructed to
achieve a minimum intake of 2 g of EPA per day commencing on the first day of chemotherapy and continuing
for the duration of their chemotherapy. Patients were
given the choice of 2 formats of supplementation: 1)
4 þ 1 g gelatin capsules per day containing 2.2 g of EPA
or 2) 7.5 mL of liquid FO per day (2.2 g of EPA). Because
poor compliance has been reported in previous studies,2,5,6 we chose this approach to increase study adherence. Capsules were provided in kind by Ocean Nutrition
Canada (Ocean Nutrition Canada, Nova Scotia, Canada).
Liquid FO was purchased from NutraSea (Ascenta
Health, Nova Scotia, Canada). These companies did not
have access to the study results or influence the conclusions of the current study.
Blood was drawn by a registered nurse at the cancer
center laboratory before the initiation of chemotherapy
(baseline), 1 day before each 3-week cycle of chemotherapy, and on the last day of chemotherapy. Performance
status was assessed by a physician using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale at baseline. Stage
of disease was based on the American Joint Committee on
Cancer stage groupings (I, II, III, and IV).18 Response to
treatment was evaluated by a radiologist and oncologist
on the basis of clinical examination and imaging, which
was comprised of CT, magnetic imaging resonance imaging, or x-ray.

Organization19 categories were used to classify patients as
underweight (BMI <18.5), normal (BMI 18.5 to 24.9),
overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9) and obese (BMI 30).
Body composition was analyzed using electronically
stored CT images that had been obtained for diagnostic
purposes. Cross-sectional areas (in cm2) of skeletal muscle,
IMAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral
adipose tissue (VAT) were determined using 2 consecutive
images from the third lumbar vertebrae (L3) using sliceOmatic software (version 4.3; Tomovision, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). L3 was chosen as a landmark because it is
reported to be strongly correlated with whole-body muscle
and adipose tissue.20,21 Mean tissue areas for 2 consecutive
images were calculated and normalized for stature (cm2/
m2). Total adipose tissue (TAT) was calculated by summing the IMAT, VAT, and SAT. Skeletal muscle attenuation, an indicator of muscle fat content,22 was recorded. A
lower value indicates increased fat infiltration and is associated with lower muscle strength and lower strength per
muscle size (poor muscle quality).13 The precision error
for muscle attenuation using CT is <1%,22 which makes
it ideal for detecting longitudinal changes. Sex-specific cutpoints for the L3 muscle index previously defined in an
advanced cancer population20 were used to designate
patients as sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic. Males with
<55.4 cm2/m2 of muscle and females with <38.9 cm2/m2
of muscle were classified as sarcopenic.
Changes in muscle and adipose tissue were expressed
as the percentage change from the initial CT scan and divided by the number of days elapsed between the 2 CT
images. The daily rate of change was multiplied by 100 to
form a standard unit expressed as percentage change/100
days to allow for comparison between individuals.
Because the precision error for muscle and adipose tissue
is approximately 2%,20 a change between 2 and þ2 was
considered maintenance of tissue. Total fat mass and total
skeletal mass were estimated from cross-sectional areas as
described by Shen et al21: skeletal muscle mass ¼ 0.166 
[skeletal muscle greater than 5 cm higher than L4 to L5
(cm2)] þ 2.142 (r2 ¼ 0.855); fat mass ¼ 0.068  [total
adipose at L3 (cm2)] þ 4.142 (r2 ¼ 0.927). A density of
1.04 g/cm3 was used to convert muscle volume to mass.23

Weight and Body Composition
Height was measured by a stadiometer and weight was
measured using a medical balance beam scale at baseline
and at each time point. Height and weight were used to
compute body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2. World Health

Compliance
The amount of supplement taken per day was recorded by
the subjects and any unused capsules or liquid were
returned at the time of patient visits. A compliance rate
<80% resulted in withdrawal from the study.

Plasma Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis
Blood was collected in heparnized tubes and centrifuged
to isolate plasma. Plasma was frozen immediately at
80 C until analysis. A chloroform-methanol solution
(2:1, volume/volume) was used to extract plasma fatty
acids and phospholipid (PL) was isolated on G-plates.24
The PL band was scraped and C17:0 standard (1 mg/L)
was added followed by direct methylation. Plasma PL
fatty acid composition was determined by automated gas
liquid chromatography (Varian 3600CX Gas Chromatograph; Varian, Missisauga, Canada) as previously
described.24 Peaks of saturated, monounsaturated, and
polyunsaturated fatty acids between 6 and 24 carbon
chain lengths were identified by comparison with a known
standard (Supelco, Bellefonte, Penn, division of Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo). Fatty acids were
expressed as a quantitative amount (lg/mL) and as a percentage of the total PL.25
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was change in muscle between
baseline and the end of chemotherapy. Adipose tissue,
body weight, and plasma EPA at baseline and at the end
of chemotherapy were secondary endpoints.
Data are presented as the mean  standard error
(SE) and significance was determined at P < .05. All tests
were 2 sided. The two-sample Student t test and chisquare test were used to determine differences between the
SOC and FO groups. The reference data were collected
during a different time period (2001 to 2007) then data
from the SOC and FO groups. As such, data for the reference group are provided as a frame of reference and were
not compared statistically with the SOC and FO groups.
Repeated-measures analysis of variance with Bonferonni
comparisons was used to analyze changes in tissue mass
from baseline to the end of chemotherapy in the SOC and
FO groups. Simple linear regression was used to examine
the relation between muscle rate of change and plasma PL
EPA. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0; SPSS
Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Patients were recruited over a 2-year period (2007-2009).
A total of 204 patients were initially screened for inclusion
criteria. Major reasons for exclusion included ineligible
for chemotherapy, participation in a clinical trial (non-

1778

standard treatment), and <2 CT images available.
Twenty-four patients were recruited to the SOC group
and 17 patients were recruited to the FO group. All
patients completed study protocol. One patient from the
FO group was unable to achieve 80% compliance to the
FO supplement and was subsequently excluded from analyses. There was no difference in treatment intent (19%
received adjuvant therapy in the FO group vs 17% in the
SOC group). The average time on study was comparable
between the 2 groups (10.6  0.8 weeks in the FO group
and 9.8  0.7 weeks in the SOC group; P ¼ .43).
There were no significant differences with regard to
baseline characteristics and anthropometric measures
noted between the FO and SOC groups (Table 1).
Patients recruited to the current study were representative
of the local population because baseline characteristics
were within the same range as the reference group.
Although weight loss was not an inclusion criterion, a history of weight loss within the preceding 6 months was
common. Despite this, >50% of patients were overweight
or obese, similar to the reference population (53%).
Anthropometric Measurements
Patients in the SOC group lost significantly more weight
than patients in the FO group (Table 2). In the SOC
group, 29% of patients maintained or gained weight (04.6 kg) whereas 69% of patients receiving FO maintained
or gained weight (0-6.7 kg) during chemotherapy. The
amount of weight lost by the SOC group was similar to
that of the reference group (Table 2).
Approximately 69% of patients in the FO group
maintained or gained muscle compared with 29% of
patients in the SOC group. Four patients in the SOC
group became sarcopenic over the course of chemotherapy
whereas no patients in the FO group became sarcopenic.
One patient in the SOC group and 1 in the reference
group had SAT outside the viewing field and were not
included in TAT analyses. Changes in muscle, IMAT,
and TAT over time are shown in Table 2. Tissue rate of
change in the reference group fell within the same range as
the rates observed in the SOC group.
Estimated whole-body skeletal and fat mass are
shown in Table 3. Loss of skeletal mass was evident in
patients in the SOC group, with some patients losing up
to 5.2 kg of muscle from baseline to the end of treatment.
Loss of skeletal muscle occurred concurrently with
increased muscle fat content in the SOC group. Skeletal
muscle attenuation decreased by approximately 3.5 HU
in the SOC group (Table 3). This decrease represents an

and SOC groups. No significant difference in treatment
response was observed; 69% of patients (n ¼ 11) in the
FO group had stable disease or achieved a partial response
to chemotherapy versus 67% of patients (n ¼ 16) in the
SOC group.
PL Analysis
Mean plasma PL EPA in the SOC group at baseline was
comparable to EPA concentrations at the end of the study
period. The mean plasma PL EPA in the FO group was
increased more than 2-fold from baseline (Table 4). Despite a reported compliance rate of >95% (2.1  0.6 g
EPA/day), variability in plasma EPA was evident, with
changes from baseline ranging from 0.3 to þ3.8%. In
view of this variation, regression analysis was used to
examine the relation between EPA incorporation and
muscle rate of change in the FO group (Fig. 1). There was
a positive linear relation noted between change in plasma
EPA concentration and rate of muscle change from baseline to the end of the study (r2 ¼ 0.55; P ¼ .01).
Treatment Side Effects and Adverse Events
FO was well tolerated. No serious adverse events related
to the study intervention were reported.

DISCUSSION
The efficacy of FO to prevent muscle loss has been the
focus of several studies,2-9 but to the best of our knowledge the current study is the first to use CT images to provide a direct measurement of the effect of FO on skeletal
muscle and adipose tissue depots. The results indicate that
supplementation with FO ameliorates muscle and adipose
tissue wasting in lung cancer patients and provides a bene-

1780

fit over patients treated with SOC receiving first-line
chemotherapy.
On average, patients receiving FO maintained muscle mass, but the rate of muscle change varied. In addition,
the concentration of plasma PL EPA after FO supplementation was variable despite high compliance with the FO
supplement regimen. It is unlikely the variation in plasma
PL concentration was solely because of misreporting of
intake as a prior study in cancer patients also observed differential incorporation of n-3 fatty acids into plasma
PL.26 Regression analysis demonstrated a positive relation between increasing concentration of EPA and rate
of muscle gain, with 55% of the variability in muscle
change explained by plasma EPA concentrations. We
recently reported a relation between skeletal muscle and
physiological concentrations of EPA.27 However, with
the exception of a trial conducted by Fearon et al,5 previous studies have not related plasma EPA concentrations
with body composition. Rather, plasma EPA was used as
a measure of compliance2,8,28 or was not reported.7
Because EPA must be incorporated into cells and tissues
to exert physiological functions, we conjecture that failure to account for differential EPA incorporation limits
the interpretation of prior studies and explains why the
efficacy of EPA to promote muscle gain has not been
consistently demonstrated.

FO Supplementation and Body Composition/Murphy et al

Patients receiving FO maintained weight, muscle
mass, and adipose tissue throughout approximately 10
weeks of chemotherapy despite presenting with mean
weight loss of 6.3% over the previous 6 months. This supports findings of earlier trials that demonstrated a benefit
of FO with regard to weight and lean body mass.2,3
Improvements in weight have been reported in chemotherapy trials29 and we acknowledge that the maintenance
of weight and muscle mass reported herein cannot be
solely attributed to FO intervention. However, both the
SOC and FO groups were found to have similar chemotherapy response rates. Maintenance of body composition
may have additional clinical implications because weight
and tissue loss have been shown to influence performance
status1 and may dictate a patient’s eligibility for additional
lines of treatment. Therefore, targeting those patients
receiving first-line chemotherapy represents an opportunity for timely intervention to prevent the deterioration of
body composition.
To our knowledge, the relation between IMAT and
skeletal muscle in cancer patients has not been previously
explored and the observation that FO supplementation
results in loss of IMAT while maintaining muscle mass is
novel. IMAT accumulation is correlated with insulin resistance,30,31 which has been implicated in the development of cancer cachexia.32 Increased fat infiltration of
skeletal muscle has also been observed with weight gain.22
Although greater than two-thirds of the FO group maintained or gained weight, this was not reflected in IMAT
accumulation or muscle attenuation values. We hypothesize that EPA may function to decrease IMAT via its ability
to suppress lipogenesis,33 thereby reducing the deposition
of lipids in muscle. In addition, EPA supplementation has
been shown to reduce fat accumulation via stimulation of
lipid oxidation.34 The functional significance of this
requires clarification and will be the focus of future work.
The current study focused on intervention in newly
referred patients, to prevent deterioration of body composition and weight loss. Previous studies have treated
patients who were close to death and had severe weight
loss,5,7,28 in whom intervention with a single agent may
be limited. Selecting newly referred patients enabled the
accrual of patients with better survival prospects, thus
avoiding patient morbidity, which has complicated the
results of prior trials.6,7 In addition, offering patients 2
formats of FO supplementation resulted in high compliance to the supplements, with only 1 of 17 patients
reporting a compliance rate <80%. This represents a
25% increase in compliance compared with prior stud-

Cancer

ies,2,6,8 and may explain why our results demonstrated the
efficacy of FO on muscle mass whereas the results of other
trials were inconsistent.2,6,7 Providing patients with a
choice of supplement format may be a potential approach
to strengthen compliance in future trials.
At our cancer center, patients receiving treatment
with palliative intent (who comprised >80% of the
patient population in the current study) have expressed
low interest in participation in randomized studies. The
unique use of a nonrandomized, open-label design
resulted in timely study enrolment, improved compliance,
and no reports of contamination between treatment arms.
Although the current study was an open-label design, we
believe the results are strengthened by the inclusion of a
larger reference group of patients with NSCLC from our
cancer center. The patients in the SOC and FO groups
shared similar baseline characteristics as patients in the reference group and the changes in weight and body composition observed in the SOC group during chemotherapy
were comparable to those noted in the reference group.
Early intervention with FO during chemotherapy
resulted in maintenance of weight, muscle mass, and muscle quality compared with patients receiving SOC. However, the results of the current study require verification in
larger randomized trials. Because the incorporation of
EPA in PL varies greatly between individuals, future trials
should stratify outcomes based on the incorporation of
EPA. The use of FO as a therapy to prevent body composition changes in patient populations who are at an
increased risk of developing cancer cachexia merits further
investigation.
