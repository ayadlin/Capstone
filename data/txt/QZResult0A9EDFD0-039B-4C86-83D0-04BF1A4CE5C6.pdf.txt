BACKGROUND: For limited-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), treatment decisions are often influenced
by toxicity profiles. One strategy that minimizes chemotherapy-induced toxicities is abbreviated chemotherapy plus
consolidation involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT). Involved-node radiotherapy (INRT) is a new concept to DLBCL,
aimed to reduce radiotherapy-induced toxicities. We retrospectively review the long-term outcomes of limited-stage
DLBCL treated with abbreviated systemic therapy and radiotherapy focusing on field size: IFRT versus INRT.
METHODS: The British Columbia Cancer Agency Lymphoid Cancer Database was used to identify patients diagnosed
with limited-stage DLBCL (stage I/II, without B-symptoms; bulk < 10 cm) from 1981 to 2007. Patients were prescribed
3 cycles of chemotherapy plus IFRT (1981-1996) or INRT5 cm (1996-2007), defined as INRT to the prechemotherapy
involved nodes with margins  5 cm. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were identified: 56% were aged >60 years,
34% had stage II disease, 55% had extranodal disease, 19% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and 15%
received rituximab. The two radiotherapy groups were IFRT (138 patients; 48%) and INRT5cm (150 patients; 52%);
median follow-up was 117 and 89 months, respectively. Distant relapse was the most common site of failure in both
groups. After INRT5 cm, marginal recurrence was infrequent (2%). Time to progression (P ¼ .823), progression-free
survival (P ¼ .575), and overall survival (P ¼ .417) were not significantly different between the radiotherapy cohorts.
Radiotherapy field size was not a significant prognostic factor on multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This research
is the first known body of work to apply the concept of INRT to limited-stage DLBCL. Reducing the field size from
IFRT to INRT5 cm maintains a low marginal recurrence risk with no impact on overall outcome. Cancer

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogenous group of lymphomas and constitutes approximately onethird of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses.1 At diagnosis, approximately 25% to 30% of patients are found to have
limited-stage disease.2,3 These patients have a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates reported between
70% and 92% following curative-intent treatments.4-7
The optimal management of limited-stage DLBCL remains controversial. Currently, the 2 most common treatment
approaches are 1) extended course chemotherapy with rituximab, or 2) abbreviated chemotherapy with rituximab followed by consolidation radiotherapy.2,3,8-15 The choice of therapy is often influenced by physician preference and the
comparative toxicity profiles. Extended chemotherapy has been associated with higher rates of cardiac toxicity,4

myelosuppression,4 serious infection,16 myelodysplastic
syndrome, and acute myelogenous leukemia.17 These toxicity rates are reduced by the use of abbreviated chemotherapy; however, this is at the cost of other toxicity risks
associated with the addition of consolidation radiotherapy
to the treatment package, the most serious of which is the
small rate of radiotherapy-induced second malignancy in
long-term survivors. Therefore, lowering the risk of radiotherapy-induced toxicity is an important objective to
improve the therapeutic ratio for patients receiving treatment with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation
radiotherapy.
For patients treated with abbreviated systemic therapy, the rationale for consolidation radiotherapy is to
improve disease control in the sites of original involvement.18 This is based on the observation that local recurrence is the most common pattern of first failure
following systemic therapy alone, comprising 41% to
63% of relapses.3,6,16 Involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT)
achieves excellent infield control in the original sites of
disease,4,16,19 and is therefore the current standard of care
to consolidate abbreviated systemic therapy. Involvednode radiotherapy (INRT) is a relatively new radiotherapeutic concept that aims to maintain the high rates of
local disease control achieved by IFRT, while minimizing
the risks of radiation-induced toxicities. INRT has already
been adopted into the management strategies for limitedstage Hodgkin lymphoma20-22 and follicular lymphoma.23 However, to date, the role of INRT has not
been investigated in limited-stage DLBCL.
This research is the first known body of work to
apply the concept of INRT to limited-stage DLBCL. This
population-based cohort study investigates the outcomes
of patients with limited-stage DLBCL treated with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation radiotherapy at
British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), focusing on
radiotherapy field size: IFRT versus INRT. In short, we
aim to assess the efficacy and safety of consolidation
INRT in the management of limited-stage DLBCL. Furthermore, this research provides unprecedented, longterm outcome data of limited-stage DLBCL treated
with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation
radiotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Identification
The BCCA Lymphoid Cancer Database was used to identify all patients diagnosed with limited-stage DLBCL

Cancer

between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 2007, and
who were treated with abbreviated chemotherapy and
radiotherapy with curative intent. Limited-stage was
defined as Ann Arbor stage IA or IIA, nonbulky (<10
cm), with or without extranodal disease. All cases were biopsy-proven and centrally reviewed. Staging required
computed tomography (CT) of neck, chest, abdomen,
and pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, plus selected imaging as
clinically indicated. Fludeoxyglucose–positron emission
tomography (PET) was not used for staging or for treatment decisions. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
complete blood counts were measured at diagnosis.
Patients with primary testicular or central nervous system
lymphomas were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were
positive human immunodeficiency virus status, incomplete staging, and non-curative treatment. All patients
were intended to receive 3 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) or
CHOP-like chemotherapy. From 2003, rituximab was
also incorporated into the treatment of patients with limited-stage DLBCL. By definition, consolidation radiotherapy encompassed all prechemotherapy sites of disease.
Central review was performed to confirm the radiotherapy field size and to localize the sites of relapse with
respect to the radiotherapy field. Approval was obtained
from the University of British Columbia–BCCA Research
Ethics Board prior to commencement of this study.
Radiotherapy
At the BCCA, prospectively defined guidelines exist to
guide clinical practice. From January 1981 to June 1996,
the radiotherapy policy was for IFRT, which encompassed
all prechemotherapy involved lymph node group(s) as per
conventional IFRT definitions. In July 1996, the radiotherapy policy was changed to include only the prechemotherapy involved nodes with a reduced margin: for the
purposes of this study, this volume has been termed
‘‘involved-node radiotherapy with margins up to 5 cm’’
(INRT5 cm) to acknowledge and distinguish from
other published definitions of INRT.21,24 The clinical target volume (CTV) encompassed the prechemotherapy
volume of disease, within postchemotherapy anatomical
limits; for example, in the setting of a prechemotherapy
mediastinal mass displacing the lung laterally without
lung invasion, then only the width of the postchemotherapy mediastinum was included in the CTV, rather than
the full prechemotherapy width of the mass. To account
for physiological movement and interfraction set-up variation, non-uniform margins up to 5 cm were added to the

4157

Original Article

CTV to form the planning target volume (PTV); for
example, the PTV for mediastinal and hilar nodes
required a larger superior-inferior margin to account for
the greater range of respiratory motion in these directions.
Therefore, the total margin from CTV to PTV varied
according to the expected physiologic movement of the
involved nodes but did not exceed 5 cm. Although these
radiotherapy guidelines were broadly supported and
adopted within the BCCA, the actual radiotherapy field
size that was delivered remained at the discretion of the
treating radiation oncologist; thus, central review of all
radiotherapy plans was undertaken, and the analyses performed were based on the actual radiotherapy field size
delivered rather than the treatment era.
All patients underwent radiotherapy simulation in
the treatment position. Because of the early treatment era,
CT simulation was not a mandatory requirement for this
study, and PET was not used for radiotherapy planning.
Radiotherapy was fractionated at 5 fractions per week.
Regular portal imaging was performed for quality
assurance.
Definition of Sites of Relapse
The first sites of lymphoma relapse were recorded as either
infield, marginal, or distant to the radiotherapy field.
Infield failure was defined as relapse occurring within the
radiotherapy portal. Distant failure was defined as all
other sites of relapse outside the radiotherapy field. Marginal failure was considered a subtype of distant failure
and was applicable only to the INRT5 cm group. Marginal failure was defined as relapse occurring outside of
the treated INRT5 cm field but within the conventional
IFRT field.
Statistical Analysis
All eligible patients were included in the retrospective
analyses by intention to treat. The Pearson chi-square test
was used to compare characteristics of the patients in the
IFRT and INRT5 cm groups. Progression-free survival
(PFS) was defined from the date of diagnosis to the date
of progression, relapse, or death from any cause. OS was
measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death
from any cause. Time to progression (TTP) was defined
from the date of diagnosis to the date of progression,
relapse, or death from treatment toxicity; patients who
died from unrelated causes while in sustained remission
were censored at the date of death. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used for survival estimates, with censoring of
survival times at the date of last follow-up for those

4158

patients not experiencing the relevant event; comparisons
were made using the log-rank test.
Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the
impact of potential prognostic factors on survival endpoints, including age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status, stage, nodal size,
presence of extranodal disease, serum LDH, and type of
radiotherapy field. Multivariate analyses were performed
using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and
the stepwise backward procedure to identify independent
prognostic factors. Removal and entry levels of significance were 0.05 and 0.10, respectively.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Using the BCCA Lymphoid Cancer Database, 320
patients were identified with limited-stage DLBCL
treated with abbreviated chemotherapy and consolidation
radiotherapy. Thirty-two patients were excluded for the
following reasons: testicular primary in 15, central nervous system primary in 5, human immunodeficiency virus
positivity in 6, and palliative intent in 6. Of the remaining
288 patients, median age was 64 years (range, 15-88
years), 66% had stage I disease, 19% had elevated serum
LDH, and 55% had extranodal involvement. All patients
were planned to receive 3 cycles of CHOP or CHOP-like
chemotherapy; however, 2 patients received only 2 cycles
of chemotherapy: 1 due to patient refusal and 1 due to disease progression.
The distribution of patients into the 2 radiotherapy
groups were 138 patients (48%) into the IFRT group and
150 patients (52%) into the INRT5 cm group. Three
patients in the IFRT group failed to complete radiotherapy due to patient refusal. The patient characteristics of
the 2 radiotherapy cohorts were evenly balanced except
for 2 features: extranodal disease (P < .001) and rituximab administration (P ¼ .050) were more frequent in the
INRT5 cm group (Table 1). Arguably, the greater proportion of patients with extranodal disease in the
INRT5 cm group may reflect the concerns of treating
physicians regarding the increased risks of radiotherapyinduced toxicities associated with larger field sizes. The
larger proportion of patients receiving rituximab in the
INRT5 cm group reflects the change to the treatment
protocol in 2003. Notably, there was no difference in the
stage-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) score
between the radiotherapy groups (P ¼ .337).

A total of 14 patients are unknown.

Median follow-up for living patients of the entire
cohort was 96 months (range, 4-262 months). The median follow-up for living patients was longer in the IFRT
group than in the INRT5 cm group: 117 months versus
89 months, respectively.
Radiotherapy Dose
Radiotherapy fractionation was at the discretion of the
treating radiation oncologist. Radiotherapy was prescribed to total doses of 30-45 Gy: 45% of patients were
prescribed <35 Gy, and 55% were prescribed 35 Gy.
The most common fractionation schedules were 35 Gy in
20 fractions in 43% of patients, and 30 Gy in 10 fractions
in 32% of patients. Total radiotherapy dose was evenly
balanced between the 2 radiotherapy groups (P ¼ .636;
Table 1).
Patterns of Disease Failure
Overall, 64 of the 288 (22%) patients relapsed. Distant
failure was the most common pattern of first relapse.

Cancer

September 1, 2012

Fifty patients (17%) relapsed distant to the radiotherapy
field without infield relapse: 24 (17%) in the IFRT
group and 26 (17%) in the INRT5 cm group (Table
2). By definition, marginal relapse was only applicable to
the INRT5 cm group and represented distant failures
occurring outside of the INRT5 cm field but within
the conventional IFRT field. Therefore, distant recurrences in the INRT5 cm group were subclassified as
‘‘distant-only’’, 20 (13%); ‘‘marginal-only’’, 3 (2%); and
‘‘marginal plus distant’’, 3 (2%) (Table 2). Importantly,
INRT5 cm was associated with a low marginal-only
relapse rate (2%).
At the end of treatment, 2 patients had documented
disease progression. One patient was noncompliant with
treatment, stopping IFRT early after 5.25 Gy in 3 fractions, and was found to have infield disease progression.
The second patient received 2 of 3 planned cycles of
chemotherapy followed by INRT5 cm and progressed
both infield and distantly. Both patients were included in
the analyses by intention to treat.

Figure 1. Survival curves for the whole cohort (n ¼ 288) are shown for (a) time to progression, (b) progression-free survival, and
(c) overall survival. Time to progression is defined from the date of diagnosis to the date of progression, relapse, or death from
treatment toxicity; patients dying from unrelated causes while in sustained remission were censored at their date of death.

Time to Progression, Progression-Free
Survival, and Overall Survival
For the entire cohort, median TTP has not yet been
reached, median PFS was 151 months and median OS
was 192 months. TTP was 92% at 2 years, 84% at 5 years
and 75% at 10 years; PFS was 90% at 2 years, 75% at 5
years and 58% at 10 years; and OS was 94% at 2 years,
82% at 5 years and 65% at 10 years (Fig. 1). There were
no statistically significant differences in TTP (P ¼ .823),
PFS (P ¼ .575) or OS (P ¼ .417) between the 2 radiotherapy groups (Fig. 2 and Table 3).
Radiotherapy Field Size and Prognostic
Factors for Survival
On univariate analyses, age >60 years (P ¼ .010) and elevated serum LDH (P ¼ .039) were significant predictors
for reduced TTP (Table 3). Interestingly, treatment with

4160

rituximab was not associated with a significant difference
in TTP (P ¼ .685); however, due to the small proportion
of patients and shorter follow-up, no firm conclusion can
be drawn. Age was the only significant variable on univariate analyses for PFS and OS (both P < .001).
On multivariate analysis, age >60 years was the only
significant adverse prognostic factor for TTP (P ¼ .009),
PFS (P < .001) and OS (P < .001) (Table 4). Importantly, radiotherapy field size did not emerge as significant
in the multivariate model for any survival endpoint.

DISCUSSION
The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of limited-stage
DLBCL is frequently debated. Advocates for consolidation radiotherapy argue that the improved local control
obtained from the addition of radiotherapy is likely to be
associated with improved disease-specific survival (DSS),

PFS, and OS.25 The landmark Southwest Oncology
Group (SWOG) 8736 study randomized 401 patients to
abbreviated chemotherapy plus consolidation radiotherapy or extended course chemotherapy alone.4 Impressive
improvements in PFS, OS, and toxicity rates were
revealed in favor of abbreviated chemotherapy plus consolidation radiotherapy: PFS was 77% versus 64% (hazard ratio, 1.5; P ¼ .03) and OS was 82% versus 72%
(hazard ratio, 1.7; P ¼ .02) at 5 years.4 With longer follow-up, the PFS and OS advantages for abbreviated
chemotherapy and consolidation radiotherapy were seen
out to 7 and 9 years, respectively.26 Unfortunately, the
patterns of failure in the SWOG 8736 study have not
been published; however, it is likely that this improvement in PFS was due to improved local control achieved
by radiotherapy. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results database, Ballonoff et al published the
largest series of 13,420 patients with limited-stage
DLBCL: 41% of patients received radiotherapy and 59%
did not.27 The authors report that both DSS (hazard ratio,
0.82; P < .01) and OS (hazard ratio, 0.86; P < .01) were
significantly improved in the group of patients who
received radiotherapy, and these survival advantages persisted with longer term follow-up out to 15 years.27 Furthermore, a study from the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center conducted during the rituximab
era demonstrated in multivariate and matched-pair analyses that patients with limited-stage DLBCL benefited
from the addition of radiotherapy with significantly
improved 5-year PFS (82% versus 68%, P < .01) and OS
(92% versus 73%, P < .01).7 These studies suggest that

Cancer

improved local control, achieved by the addition of radiotherapy, may translate into improvements in long-term
outcomes.25
The optimal use of systemic therapy is also controversial. Advocates for extended course chemotherapy
argue that systemic disease control is likely to be improved
with additional cycles of chemotherapy. In the updated
results from the SWOG 8736 study,26 the PFS benefit
that was first seen in the group receiving abbreviated
chemotherapy and consolidation radiotherapy was lost
beyond 7 years, presumably due to inferior systemic disease control following the shorter course of systemic therapy. In the present study, distant relapse was the most
common site of failure following short course systemic
therapy and consolidation radiotherapy, and it may be
hypothesized that systemic disease control may be further
improved by intensification of systemic therapy (either by
increasing the amount of chemotherapy or by adding a
targeted, biological agent). This is likely to be of greater
relevance in the less favorable risk groups with stageadjusted IPI  1.5,26 The addition of rituximab to
extended course chemotherapy is well known to improve
PFS and OS.9,28 The benefit of adding rituximab to
abbreviated chemotherapy and consolidation radiotherapy is less clear, but has widely gained popularity in clinical practice. Extrapolating from the phase II SWOG 0014
data and comparing it to historical controls in the SWOG
8736 study, rituximab may likely improve 2-year PFS
beyond that achieved by abbreviated chemotherapy and
consolidation radiotherapy alone.8 Unfortunately, the
number of patients receiving rituximab in the present

Consolidation INRT for Limited Stage DLBCL/Campbell et al

study was too small to draw any firm conclusions regarding the contribution of rituximab on patterns of failure
and PFS in this cohort of favorable-risk patients who
received abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation
radiotherapy.
In the absence of prospective randomized trials of
consolidation radiotherapy in the rituximab era, the optimal management of limited-stage DLBCL remains controversial.12,13,25 International guidelines are inconsistent
with respect to management recommendations. For nonbulky, limited-stage DLBCL, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends 3 cycles of CHOP and
rituximab plus locoregional radiotherapy (30-36 Gy), or
6 to 8 cycles of CHOP and rituximab with or without
consolidation radiotherapy.11 On the other hand, the European Society of Medical Oncology stratifies treatment
options according to the age-adjusted IPI, relying on
extended course chemotherapy and noticeably omitting
consolidation radiotherapy from their published guidelines.10 Therefore, there is variation in clinical practice,
with the choice of therapy often influenced by physician
preferences and comparative toxicity profiles.
Reducing the morbidity of treatment is an important consideration to optimize the therapeutic ratio. In
2006, Girinsky et al first coined the phrase ‘‘involved
node radiotherapy’’, and hypothesized that INRT would
reduce the risk of radiotherapy-induced toxicity in
patients with limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.21 Dosimetric studies demonstrate that reducing the radiotherapy
field from IFRT to INRT significantly reduces the radiation dose to lungs, breast, and thyroid.29,30 Using dosimetric parameters as surrogate endpoints for toxicity, it is
reasonable to extrapolate that these dose reductions are
likely to translate into lower risks of radiation-induced
toxicities and second malignancies in long-term survivors.
Our group has retrospectively evaluated the impact of
reduced radiotherapy field sizes on patterns of relapse and
survival in limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.20,23 In both of these disease entities, we
have shown that reducing the radiotherapy field size to
INRT5 cm is safe, with no adverse impact on PFS or
OS.20,23 Until now, the efficacy and safety of INRT has
been untested in patients with limited-stage DLBCL
treated with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation radiotherapy.
Involved-node radiotherapy is a new radiotherapeutic approach in the management of DLBCL. The premise
of INRT is founded on the observation that, unlike
Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL does not usually involve

contiguous nodal groups, and thus reducing the field to
INRT is unlikely to affect patterns of failure. A singlearm, pilot study from Japan describes small, ‘‘localized’’
radiotherapy fields to cover the prechemotherapy gross
disease with margins of at least 2 to 3 cm.31 All 25 patients
had limited-stage DLBCL located in cervical nodes or
Waldeyer’s ring, and were treated with 3 cycles of CHOP
followed by consolidation radiotherapy. With a median
follow-up of 42 months, the authors reported 96% 2-year
OS, 8% overall relapse rate, and no marginal-only relapses.31 A Korean retrospective study of 86 patients with
limited-stage DLBCL of the head or neck describes
‘‘involved-lesion radiotherapy’’ with margins of 2 to 3 cm
around the prechemotherapy disease to field edge, to consolidate 2 to 6 cycles of CHOP with or without rituximab.32 With a median follow-up of 57 months, the
authors report a 9% relapse rate with no marginal-only
relapses.32 Although these studies are smaller in size and
shorter in follow-up, their results are consistent with our
findings.
This study is the first research article to compare
INRT to conventional IFRT with respect to patterns of
failure in patients with limited-stage DLBCL. Reducing
the field size from IFRT to INRT5 cm appears to be
safe in the treatment of limited-stage DLBCL with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation radiotherapy.
Following INRT5 cm, distant-only relapse was the
most common pattern of first failure, and marginal-only
relapse was reassuringly infrequent (2%). Reducing the
radiotherapy field from IFRT to INRT5 cm did not
affect TTP, PFS, or OS. Extrapolating from dosimetric
studies, we postulate that the smaller volume of INRT5
cm will translate into lower radiotherapy-induced toxicity
rates, and thus improve the therapeutic ratio in long-term
survivors. There is a paucity of published data describing
the dose-response relationship of DLBCL; in this study,
lower radiotherapy doses (30 to 35 Gy) did not compromise local control and may confer a benefit by reducing
toxicity risks. Unfortunately, the retrospective design of
this study does not allow for reliable assessment of radiotherapy-induced toxicities as endpoints. Although limited
by the retrospective design and moderately sized patient
population, our results suggest that INRT5 cm can be
safely incorporated into routine clinical practice without
detrimental effects on long-term disease control or survival outcomes. Because of the readiness of the international community to adopt INRT into clinical practice, it
is unlikely that a randomized, controlled trial will be
undertaken in the future.

Original Article

The efficacy of INRT5 cm is limited by the sensitivity of disease detection, and the precision of radiotherapy planning and delivery. Recent innovations in imaging
technology and their increasing availability are likely to
further improve INRT planning and outcomes. Prechemotherapy CT-PET scans possess high specificity and
sensitivity for detecting active sites of DLBCL33,34 and are
likely to facilitate more accurate delineation of the CTV
in INRT planning. Prechemotherapy PET scans were not
used in this study; however, we hypothesize that incorporating PET into radiotherapy planning may result in
reduced ‘‘marginal-only’’ relapse rates, even below the 2%
we report after INRT5 cm. Furthermore, the PTV margins for INRT5 cm were site- and technology-dependent. Tighter PTV margins may be achievable with stateof-the-art radiotherapy techniques, for example, 4-dimensional CT simulation, respiratory gating, and real-time,
image-guided radiotherapy. Therefore, when undertaking
INRT planning, we recommend that consideration be
given to the sensitivity of disease detection, precision of
radiotherapy technologies, and physiological movement
and reproducibility.
In conclusion, IFRT can be safely replaced by
INRT5 cm in limited-stage DLBCL treated with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation radiotherapy.
We postulate that this reduction in radiotherapy volume
may lower the risk of radiotherapy-induced toxicities and
second malignancies, thereby improving the therapeutic
ratio in long-term survivors of DLBCL. We also hypothesize that new technologies may allow for continued refinement of INRT and further enhance the clinical benefits of
reduced radiotherapy field sizes.
