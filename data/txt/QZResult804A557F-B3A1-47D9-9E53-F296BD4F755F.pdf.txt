The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Antibody Cetuximab
Induces Autophagy in Cancer Cells by Downregulating HIF-1α
and Bcl-2 and Activating the Beclin 1/hVps34 Complex
Xinqun Li and Zhen Fan

Abstract
Autophagy is a regulated catabolic process triggered in cells deprived of nutrients or growth factors that
govern nutrient uptake. Here, we report that autophagy is induced by cetuximab, a therapeutic antibody that
blocks epidermal growth factor receptor function. Cancer cell treatment with cetuximab triggered autophagosome
formation, conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 from its cytoplasmic to membraneassociated form, and increased acidic vesicular organelle formation. Autophagy occurred when cetuximab inhibited the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, but not
when it inhibited only the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/Erk pathway,
and it was accompanied by decreased levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) and Bcl-2. Stable overexpression of a HIF-1α mutant prevented cetuximab-induced autophagy and decrease in Bcl-2 levels. Knockdown of autophagy regulator beclin 1 or cell treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, a class III
PI3K (hVps34) inhibitor, also inhibited cetuximab-induced autophagy. Furthermore, knockdown of beclin 1 or
Atg7 or treatment with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine sensitized cancer cells to cetuximab-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis argued that cetuximab acted by promoting an association between beclin 1 and
hVps34, which was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. Our findings suggest that the autophagy protects cancer
cells from the proapoptotic effects of cetuximab. Cancer Res; 70(14); 5942–52. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) is a conserved and tightly regulated cellular catabolic process that
involves the lysosomal degradation pathway (1, 2). By selectively recycling macromolecules and organelles, autophagy is
an integral part of normal cellular function, helping cells survive under starvation conditions to maintain cell growth and
the development and homeostasis of organisms (3). When
cells lack nutrients or are deprived of growth factors (which
govern the uptake of nutrients), autophagy is rapidly induced
to fuel the bioenergetics of the cells to prevent cell death. In
such circumstances, inhibiting autophagy results in accelerated cell death through apoptosis (4, 5).
Autophagy is morphologically characterized by the appearance of “double-membrane” vacuoles (autophagosomes)
in the cytoplasm. The discovery of autophagy-related genes
(Atg) and their involvement in the formation of autophagosomes in yeast has greatly increased our knowledge of the
molecular basis of autophagy (6). In yeast, all Atg genes have

been shown to act downstream of an important serine/
threonine kinase, target of rapamycin (TOR; ref. 7). Autophagy is now known to be regulated by at least two pathways—
the class I and class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
pathways (2). In mammalian cells, the mammalian TOR
(mTOR) complex 1 of the class I PI3K pathway plays an
important role upstream of the Atg1 complex, which regulates different steps in autophagosome formation; in contrast, the beclin 1 (Atg6)/hVps34 [mammalian vacuolar
protein sorting (Vps) 34 homologue] complex of the class
III PI3K pathway is essential for initiating autophagy (8, 9),
which is activated by cofactors such as the UV irradiation
resistance–associated tumor suppressor gene (UVRAG; ref. 10),
and is inhibited by some interacting proteins, including the
B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 gene (Bcl-2) and a related protein, Bcl-XL (11, 12).
Autophagy has elicited great interest and attention from
cancer biologists and oncologists in recent years because of
the increasing evidence indicating that autophagy, in addition to its normal role in cell physiology, is closely linked
to both tumorigenesis and cancer cell response to treatments
(13, 14). Beclin 1 is commonly deleted in ∼40% of prostate
cancers, 50% of breast cancers, and 75% of ovarian cancers,
suggesting it plays a tumor suppressor role in cancer development (8, 9, 15). Monoallelic deletion of beclin 1/Atg6 in
mice enhanced tumorigenesis, leading to the development
of carcinomas of the lung and liver and lymphomas (16).
On the other hand, autophagy is detected in cancer cells after

various types of treatment, such as antiestrogens and ionizing radiation (13, 14, 17). Whether the anticancer treatmentinduced autophagy leads to cancer cell death or protects
cancer cells from the treatments remains controversial, but
it seems that the outcome depends highly on the specific
context of the cancer cells and treatment types, such as tumor environment and treatment characteristics (2).
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently
overexpressed in several human cancers of epithelial origin
and plays important roles in the development and progression of these cancers. Targeting EGFR with receptor-blocking
monoclonal antibodies or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors has had therapeutic effects, which led to Food and
Drug Administration approval for treating several types of
human cancer, including head and neck and colorectal cancers. Among several pathways downstream of EGFR that are
inhibited pharmacologically by EGFR-targeting agents,
downregulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF1α) resulting from inhibition of the class-I PI3K/Akt pathway
has specifically been suggested to play a major role in mediating the antitumor activity of cetuximab, an EGFR-blocking
antibody (18–20). Because the class I PI3K pathway is known
to suppress the occurrence of autophagy through mTOR
activation, we reasoned that there might be a link between
response to cancer cells to EGFR-targeted therapy and induction of autophagy in the cells. To date, no studies have
been published reporting whether inhibiting EGFR through
therapeutic intervention is linked to occurrence of autophagy in cancer cells and what biological significance the induction of autophagy might have on cancer cells' response
to the treatment.
In this study, we tested our hypothesis by a combination of
transmission electron microscopy, fluorescent microscopy,
flow cytometry, and Western blotting to detect autophagy
in several types of cancer cells after cetuximab treatment.
We also explored the biochemical mechanisms by which
autophagy was induced after cetuximab treatment and
the biological significances of the autophagy. Our findings
suggest that autophagy occurring after cetuximab treatment
likely protects cancer cells against apoptosis resulting from
deprivation of growth signaling from the EGFR pathway.
Novel approaches that inhibit autophagy may therefore be
combined with cetuximab to enhance the therapeutic response of cancer cells.

caspase-7 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp.
Cell lines and cell culture
A431 human vulvar squamous carcinoma cells, DiFi colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and HCC827 human non–small
cell lung cancer cells were previously described (18–24). All cell
lines were grown and maintained in DMEM or Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L
glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
and incubated in a humidified atmosphere (95% air and
5% CO2) at 37°C.
cDNA constructs and transfection
cDNA expression constructs containing myristoylated
PI3K, myristoylated Akt, constitutively active mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1; S217E/S221D),
and a HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain
(ODD) deletion mutant (HIF-1α/ΔODD) were previously described (20, 25). Bcl-2 and Rheb constructs were ordered
from Addgene. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged
LC3 cDNA expression construct was a gift from Dr. Noboru
Mizushima (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo,
Japan). Transfection of these constructs was performed with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Small interfering RNA and transfection
Two 21-mer oligonucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA)
duplexes targeting beclin 1 (sense sequence: CAGAUACUCUUUUAGACCAtt; antisense sequence: UGGUCUAAAAGAGUAUCUGtg) and Atg7 (sense sequence: GGAACACUGU‐
AUAACACCAtt; antisense sequence: UGGUGUUAUACAGUGUUCCaa), respectively, and a negative control siRNA were
acquired from Ambion, Inc. In pilot experiments, we tested
different concentrations of siRNA oligonucleotides with different time intervals of transfection using Lipofectamine
2000. We judged the transfection efficiency based on the
uptake of FITC-conjugated oligonucleotides and determined
the efficiency of siRNA-mediated protein knockdown by
Western blotting analysis.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Cultured cells were harvested with a rubber scraper and
washed twice with cold PBS. Cell pellets were lysed and kept
on ice for at least 10 minutes in a buffer containing 50 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmol/L
NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/mL leupeptin, and 25 μg/mL aprotinin. The lysates
were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were
collected. For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were
incubated with primary antibodies, and the resulting immune
complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads
(Amersham Biosciences). Whole-cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and
subjected to Western blotting with the primary antibodies
and horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies.

We visualized the signals with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).
Cell proliferation assay
After desired treatment in cell culture, the cells were incubated
in 24-well plates for 2 hours at 37°C in a CO2 incubator with 50 μL
per well of 10 mg/mL MTT and were then lysed with a lysis buffer
(500 μL/well) containing 20% SDS in dimethyl formamide/H2O
(1:1, v/v; pH 4.7) at 37°C for at least 6 hours. We determined
the number of surviving cells in each group by measuring
the absorbance of the cell lysates at an absorbance wavelength
of 570 nm. The absorbance value in each treatment group was
then normalized to that of nontreated cells as a percentage of
the absorbance value of the control and plotted against
the treatments.
Apoptosis assay
We measured apoptosis by using an ELISA kit (Roche
Diagnostics Corp.) that quantitatively measures cytoplasmic
histone–associated DNA fragments (mononucleosomes and
oligonucleosomes) and by Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognize cleaved PARP, caspase-3, or caspase-7
after various treatments, as we previously reported (26, 27).
Transmission electron microscopy
After fixation with a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde
plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH 7.3) for
1 hour, cell suspension samples were washed and treated
with 0.1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 30 minutes, stained
en bloc with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, infiltrated, and
embedded in LX-112 medium. Next, the samples were polymerized
in a 70°C oven for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were cut with a Leica
Ultracut microtome (Leica), stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate in a Leica EM stainer, and examined with a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, USA, Inc.) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were obtained using an
AMT imaging system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp.).
Detection and quantification of acidic vesicular
organelles
We subjected cells to vital staining with acridine orange
(1 μg/mL) for 15 minutes and then examined them under a
fluorescence microscope (28). To quantify the number of
AVOs formed, we removed the cells from the culture plate
with trypsin-EDTA and analyzed them using a fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) FACScan flow cytometer and
CellQuest software.

Results
Autophagy is induced in cancer cells after
cetuximab treatment
Autophagy was induced upon cetuximab treatment in
three cancer cell lines examined, including A431 vulvar squamous carcinoma cells, DiFi colorectal adenocarcinoma cells,
and HCC827 lung adenocarcinoma cells, all of which are sensitive to cetuximab (Fig. 1). Transmission electron microscopy

revealed abundant characteristic autophagosomes in all three
cell lines 48 hours after cetuximab treatment; in contrast,
autophagosomes were scarce in nontreated cells (Fig. 1A).
We also observed the conversion of the LC3/Atg8 from the
cytoplasmic form, LC3-I (18 kDa), to the autophagosomic
form, LC3-II (16 kDa), using Western blotting in the same
three cell lines shortly after overnight (16 h) exposure to 10
or 20 nmol/L cetuximab (Fig. 1B, top). We further confirmed
this result quantitatively by determining the percentage of
cells with punctate fluorescence after cetuximab treatment
or not in the cells transfected with a GFP-tagged LC3 construct (Fig. 1B, bottom). In all three cell lines, cetuximabtreated cells displayed more punctate fluorescence (LC3-II)
than did nontreated cells, which showed homogeneous fluorescence (LC3-I) or minimal punctate fluorescence. Finally, after 24 to 48 hours of cetuximab treatment, cells stained with
acridine orange dye showed the appearance of AVOs, which is
considered a relatively late event in autophagy (Fig. 1C). FACS
analysis showed that the percentage of cells with AVOs was
higher for all three cetuximab-treated cell lines than for
the corresponding nontreated cells. Together, these findings
provide strong evidence that cetuximab induced autophagy
in cancer cells.
Cetuximab-induced autophagy is mediated through
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway but not
through inhibition of the MEK/Erk pathway
The MEK/Erk and class-I PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways are
two major pathways downstream of EGFR that are inhibited
after cetuximab treatment in cancer cells (27, 29, 30). The
appearance of the autophagosomic form of LC3 (LC3-II) correlated with the inhibition of Erk, Akt, and mTOR phosphorylation and the decrease in HIF-1α protein after cetuximab
treatment in A431 cells (Fig. 2A). However, the increase in
LC3-II in the cells was not affected after transient transfection
with a constitutively active MEK1 construct (MEKS217E/
S221D), which conferred resistance to cetuximab-induced inhibition of Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, left). In contrast, the
increase was prevented by transient transfection of A431
cells with myristoylated Akt, which was constitutively phosphorylated and thus was insensitive to cetuximab treatment
(Fig. 2B, middle). Similar results were also found in the cells
with experimental elevation of Rheb protein, which increased the basal level of mTOR phosphorylation and
counteracted cetuximab-induced inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, right), suggesting that inhibition of
the Akt/mTOR pathway was required for the induction of
autophagy after cetuximab. To provide further evidence
supporting a conclusion that inhibition of the class I
PI3K pathway is causally linked to cetuximab-induced autophagy, we analyzed the autophagic response to cetuximab
or a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, in A431 cells transiently
transfected with a constitutively active PI3K (myristoylated
PI3K) construct or corresponding control. Both cetuximab
and LY294002 increased LC3-II, and decreased Akt phosphorylation in A431 cells transfected with a control (neo)
vector but not in the cells transfected with the constitutively
active PI3K construct (Fig. 2C). We conducted an additional

quantitative experiment showing a statistically significant difference in punctate LC3-GFP protein after cetuximab treatment of A431 cells transfected with the corresponding
control vector or myristoylated PI3K or Akt construct (Fig. 2D).
Together, these data indicate that the induction of autophagy after cetuximab treatment is mediated through inhibition
of the class I PI3K pathway, but not the MEK/Erk pathway.
Downregulation of HIF-1α protein by cetuximab
contributes to the induction of autophagy
The dependence of cetuximab-induced autophagy on the
inhibition of the class I PI3K pathway but not on the inhibition of the MEK/Erk pathway is reminiscent of our recent
findings that downregulation of HIF-1α, which was shown

to play a major role in cetuximab-induced antitumor activity
(20), was mediated through cetuximab-induced inhibition of
the PI3K/Akt pathway but not through the inhibition of the
MEK/Erk pathway (18–20). To define the role of HIF-1α
downregulation in cetuximab-induced autophagy, we transfected A431 cells with a HIF-1α mutant, HIF-1α/ΔODD,
which, unlike the endogenous HIF-1α, is not liable to quick
degradation in normoxia, owing to the deletion of the ODD
(18–20). We examined the effect of expression of HIF-1α/
ΔODD on cetuximab-induced autophagy using the same
experimental methods in Fig. 1. A431 cells overexpressing
HIF-1α/ΔODD showed a significant decrease in the numbers
of autophagosomes seen under the transmission electron microscope, in the level of LC3 conversion, and in the amount

of AVO formation after cetuximab treatment, whereas none
of these changes occurred in the control vector-transfected
cells (Fig. 3A–C).
Similar to its effect on cetuximab-induced autophagy,
overexpression of HIF-1α/ΔODD also strongly prevented
autophagy induced by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in
A431 cells, a result that was accompanied by a marked decrease in the level of endogenous HIF-1α protein (Fig. 3D).
Overexpression of HIF-1α/ΔODD inhibited a rapamycininduced increase in LC3-II level without affecting rapamycininduced inhibition of mTOR activity, as shown by the decreased
phosphorylation of p70S6K, a downstream target of mTOR. This
additional result indicates that inhibition of autophagy by the
overexpression of HIF-1α/ΔODD is a general phenomenon
and supports a novel role of HIF-1α functioning at the downstream of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, the inhibition of which
leads to autophagy.
Cetuximab-induced autophagy involves the
beclin 1/hVps34 complex pathway
To gain further insight into the mechanisms of cetuximabinduced autophagy, we examined the effects of knockdown

5946

Cancer Res; 70(14) July 15, 2010

of beclin 1 on cetuximab-induced autophagy (Fig. 4A). Compared with the results in siRNA controls, knockdown of beclin 1 with siRNA prevented the increase in the level of LC3-II
by cetuximab. We found similar results after pretreating the
cells with 3-methyalanine (3MA), a class-III PI3K–specific inhibitor (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that the beclin 1/
hVps34 pathway is involved in cetuximab-induced autophagy.
Bcl-2, a well-known antiapoptosis protein that is transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1α (31), was recently shown to regulate autophagy by binding to beclin 1 and thereby inhibiting
the association between beclin 1 and hVps34, which leads to
autophagy (11, 32). We found that cetuximab decreased the
level of Bcl-2 protein that occurred along with the induction
of autophagy in A431 cells, and that overexpression of HIF1α/ΔODD prevented cetuximab-induced downregulation of
Bcl-2 and autophagy (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that
one of the mechanisms by which autophagy was induced after cetuximab treatment was downregulation of Bcl-2, which
released beclin 1 from the Bcl-2/beclin 1 complex, and thereby fostered the association between beclin 1 and hVps34. To
test this novel paradigm, we transiently transfected A431
cells with a Bcl-2 construct or corresponding control and

then treated the cells with cetuximab or not for 24 hours.
We examined changes in the association between beclin 1
and hVps34 by Western blotting of beclin 1 immunoprecipitates with antibodies directed against hVps34 and beclin 1,

respectively. Cetuximab treatment enhanced the association
between beclin 1 and hVps34 in control vector–transfected
cells but not in Bcl-2–transfected cells (Fig. 4D). Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited cetuximab-induced increases in the LC3-II

HIF-1α level, indicating that Bcl-2 functions downstream
of HIF-1α.
Inhibition of cetuximab-induced autophagy enhances
the potential for apoptosis after cetuximab treatment
To determine the biological significance of autophagy on
cell growth and survival after cetuximab treatment, we examined
the effect of inhibiting autophagy on potential for cetuximabinduced apoptosis. Treatment of A431 cells with cetuximab
had only a bottom line effect on apoptosis induction, as shown
by minimal levels of cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-7,
which serve as markers of apoptosis; however, combining cetuximab with chloroquine, an autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor, or
with 3MA substantially increased the cleavage of these proteins
(Fig. 5A). The increase in the cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, and
caspase-7 was accompanied by a decreased LC3-II level in
cells treated with 3MA alone. In chloroquine-treated cells, the
level of LC3-II dramatically increased in cetuximab-nontreated
or cetuximab-treated cells because chloroquine inhibited the
lysosomal degradation pathway (33, 34).

5948

Cancer Res; 70(14) July 15, 2010

We confirmed the effect of autophagy inhibition by
the pharmacologic agents (chloroquine and 3MA) on
cetuximab-induced apoptosis by using a genetic approach
through RNA interference. Figure 5B shows that the levels
of beclin 1 and Atg7 were lower in beclin 1 siRNA– or Atg7
siRNA–treated A431 cells, respectively, than in the
corresponding control siRNA–treated cells, and only the
control siRNA–treated cells revealed a cetuximab-induced
increase in the level of LC3-II. The level of cleavage of PARP,
caspase-3, and caspase-7 after cetuximab treatment was
clearly higher in the beclin 1 siRNA– and Atg7 siRNA–treated
cells than in the control siRNA–treated cells.
To quantify apoptosis at the cellular level and show the
role of autophagy in protecting cells from cetuximab-induced
apoptosis, we compared the levels of histone-associated DNA

plus chloroquine or 3MA significantly enhanced induction of

the total number of surviving cells by combination treatment
of cetuximab and chloroquine, compared with either treatment alone (Fig. 5D), indicating that inhibition of cetuximabinduced autophagy enhances the potential for apoptosis after
cetuximab treatment.
Together with data from the mechanistic studies, we propose a model depicted in Fig. 6 showing the novel mechanism by which cetuximab induces autophagy that functions
to protect cells from cetuximab-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
In this article, we showed that autophagy was induced in
cancer cells after cetuximab treatment, protecting the cells
from cetuximab-induced inhibition of cell survival. We show
our results from three complementary lines of experiments.
First, we offer convincing evidence that autophagy is induced
in cancer cells after cetuximab treatment. Second, we
explored the mechanisms by which cetuximab induces au-

tophagy, and third, we studied the biological role of autophagy in cancer cells' response to cetuximab.
Our results, particularly our documentation of the appearance of characteristic autophagosomes on transmission electron microscopy, which is the gold standard for showing
autophagy, provide strong evidence that autophagy was induced in cancer cells after cetuximab treatment. The conversion
of LC3-I to LC3-II correlates with the extent of autophagosome
formation and is widely used as an early marker of autophagy
(35). Our quantitative analysis showed that the percentage
of punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was greater in DiFi and
HCC827 cells, in which apoptosis was induced by cetuximab,
than in A431 cells, in which apoptosis is usually weak or sometimes not observed after the treatment (19, 20). Furthermore,
our quantitative flow cytometric analysis showed that the appearance of AVOs, which is considered a relatively late event
in autophagy, occurred earlier, and the number of AVOs was
greater in DiFi and HCC827 cells than in A431 cells after cetuximab treatment. These findings suggest that the extent of

than treatment with cetuximab only. D, MTT assay showing enhanced effects of combination treatment with cetuximab (20 nmol/L × 72 h) and indicated

Figure 6. A model depicting a novel mechanism
by which cetuximab induces autophagy.
Activation of EGFR/class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway by EGF suppresses
autophagy, whereas inhibition of the pathway
by cetuximab induces autophagy. Cetuximab
downregulates HIF-1α and subsequently
decreases Bcl-2, which releases beclin 1 from
its association with Bcl-2 to form a complex
with class III PI3K/hVps34 (dashed line); the
latter complex thereby promotes autophagy.

cetuximab-induced autophagy was positively correlated with
the extent of cetuximab-induced apoptosis in the different
types of cancer cells.
Our studies relevant to the mechanisms of autophagy indicated that both the class I and class III PI3K pathways were
involved in cetuximab-induced autophagy, because constitutive activation of the class I PI3K pathway by the expression
of constitutively active P13K, Akt, or Rheb constructs inhibited cetuximab-induced autophagy, as did the inhibition of the
class III PI3K pathway by 3MA treatment or silencing beclin 1
or Atg7. In particular, we found that constitutive expression of
HIF-1α/ΔODD strongly prevented cetuximab-induced autophagy. This result echoes our recent finding that decrease in HIF1α through inhibition of protein synthesis by cetuximab plays a
major role in cetuximab-mediated antitumor activity (18–20).
The requirement of downregulation of HIF-1α for both cetuximab-mediated antitumor activity and cetuximab-induced autophagy suggests that the two events are intimately linked and
share a common pathway to the point at which the two diverge into differential cellular events. Our study suggests a
model that a decrease in Bcl-2 resulting from transcription inhibition due to a cetuximab-induced inhibition of HIF-1α protein synthesis diminished a Bcl-2-beclin 1 association, favoring
an association between beclin 1 and class III PI3K hVps34,
thereby triggering autophagy (11).
A few caveats should be clarified. First, HIF-1α has been
previously reported to play an important role in hypoxiainduced autophagy (36–39), which improves cell survival by
removing damaged organelles under metabolic stress conditions such as hypoxia (40). Our result showing that HIF-1α

5950

Cancer Res; 70(14) July 15, 2010

overexpression inhibits autophagy seems to contradict its
role in hypoxia-induced autophagy. Thus, it is important to
point out that hypoxia-induced autophagy requires specific
activation of an autophagy-inducing molecule, BNIP3 (another
BH3-only Bcl-2 family member similar to beclin 1), which is
activated by HIF-1 only in hypoxic cells (39). HIF-1 was originally discovered as a nuclear factor induced under hypoxia (41,
42). It is now known that the level of HIF-1α is regulated by
both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. Hypoxia upregulates HIF-1α protein by increasing protein
stability across various cell types, whereas cell signaling activated by the PI3K pathway increases HIF-1α protein by increasing protein synthesis in a cell type–dependent manner
(43–47). Depending on the types of available cofactors, a
HIF-1 heterodimer can transcriptionally activate over 100
genes, including Bcl-2 (31) and BNIP3 (39). Our study was conducted in normoxic conditions, and we found no change in the
level of BNIP3 after cetuximab treatment but a decrease in the
level of Bcl-2.
A second caveat is that autophagy is known to have dual
functions: On one hand, it can serve as a cytoprotective
mechanism, allowing tumor cells to survive under conditions
of metabolic stress and hypoxia and to escape anticancer
treatment–induced cell death; on the other hand, autophagy
induced by therapeutic interventions can cause the death of
cancer cells that are resistant to apoptosis (48, 49). We found
that inhibition of autophagy by a class III PI3K inhibitor,
3MA, or by a lysosomal pathway inhibitor, chloroquine, allowed
A431 cells to undergo apoptosis after cetuximab treatment,
indicating that autophagy occurring after the treatment

Cetuximab Induces Autophagy

protected cells from apoptosis that had occurred in A431 cells
after deprivation of EGFR-mediated cell signaling.
The third caveat is that it is noteworthy that our conclusion about the role of autophagy in protecting A431 cells from
cetuximab-induced apoptosis does not conflict with our finding showing more extensive autophagy in the cells (DiFi and
HC827) prone to apoptosis by cetuximab than in the cells
(A431) less sensitive to apoptosis by cetuximab (19) because
whether cells undergo apoptosis after cetuximab treatment
and the extent of apoptosis are intrinsic properties of the
cells. As a reactive response to cetuximab-induced apoptosis, autophagy attempts to rescue cells from apoptosis but
has limited capability; within a reasonable range, the extent
of autophagy is proportional to the extent of apoptosis.
Thus, it is expected that inhibition of autophagy in the
apoptosis-prone cells should also enhance apoptosis;
however, such enhancement may not be readily detectable
because of the mask of high level of cetuximab-induced
apoptosis in the apoptosis-prone cells.
In our current study, we showed cetuximab-induced autophagy in three cancer cell lines derived from the vulva
(A431), colon (DiFi), and lung (H827), with most of the mechanistic studies conducted in A431 cells. In our next studies, it
will be important to determine whether our findings are also
true in additional cancer cell lines, including cancer cells that
typically respond to cetuximab mainly by undergoing cell
growth arrest rather than cell death through apoptosis. It will
also be important to further test the mechanisms identified
in the current study; that is, in addition to Bcl-2, there are
over 100 HIF-1–targeted genes including glucose and lactate
transporters, and key enzymes for anaerobic glycolysis that
are critical for both bioenergetic and biosynthetic metabolism in cancer cells (50). Currently, it is largely unknown
how cetuximab-induced autophagy is linked to inhibition
of cancer metabolism through downregulation of HIF-1α.
Lastly, it will be necessary to determine whether the cetuxi-

mab-induced autophagy can be targeted or exploited for
therapeutic gains using appropriate in vivo tumor models
in nude mice.
In summary, we found that cetuximab induced autophagy
that protected cancer cells from the cellular effects of cetuximab treatment; the response was elicited through complex
mechanisms involving both inhibition of the class I PI3K/Akt
pathway and activation of the class III PI3K pathway. Our
data support a novel model that a decrease in Bcl-2 level
resulting from cetuximab-mediated inhibition of class I
PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway promotes autophagy
by releasing beclin 1 from its associations with Bcl-2 to
form a complex with class III PI3K/hVps34. Further in-depth
studies are needed to understand the role of autophagy in
EGFR-targeted therapy, which may benefit patients through
development of novel combination treatments to improve
patients' response to EGFR-targeted therapy through inhibition of autophagy.
