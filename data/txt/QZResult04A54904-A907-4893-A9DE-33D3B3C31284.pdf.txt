Regulator of G Protein Signaling 6 Mediates
Doxorubicin-Induced ATM and p53 Activation by
a Reactive Oxygen Species–Dependent Mechanism
Jie Huang, Jianqi Yang, Biswanath Maity, Daisuke Mayuzumi, and Rory A. Fisher

Abstract
Doxorubicin (DXR), among the most widely used cancer chemotherapy agents, promotes cancer cell death via
activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the resultant upregulation of tumor suppressor p53. The
exact mechanism by which DXR activates ATM is not fully understood. Here, we discovered a novel role for
regulator of G protein signaling 6 (RGS6) in mediating activation of ATM and p53 by DXR. RGS6 was robustly
induced by DXR, and genetic loss of RGS6 dramatically impaired DXR-induced activation of ATM and p53, as
well as its in vivo apoptotic actions in heart. The ability of RGS6 to promote p53 activation in response to DXR
was independent of RGS6 interaction with G proteins but required ATM. RGS6 mediated activation of ATM and
p53 by DXR via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent and DNA damage–independent mechanism. This
mechanism represents the primary means by which DXR promotes activation of the ATM–p53 apoptosis pathway
that underlies its cytotoxic activity. Our findings contradict the canonical theories that DXR activates ATM
primarily by promoting DNA damage either directly or indirectly (via ROS) and that RGS6 function is mediated
by its interactions with G proteins. These findings reveal a new mechanism for the chemotherapeutic actions of
DXR and identify RGS6 as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6310–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Doxorubicin (DXR) belongs to the anthracycline class of
antitumor agents that are among the most effective and
widely used chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of
human cancers (1). It interferes with DNA topoisomerase II
(2, 3) and also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 4).
Both of these mechanisms can induce double-stranded DNA
breaks (DSB) that promote death of cancer cells by activating
the DNA damage response (DDR), a complex signaling cascade that carries out DNA repair or induces apoptosis in cells
with severe DNA damage (5, 6). The ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) protein kinase plays a critical role in sensing
such DSBs and in orchestrating the signaling output including
induction of the tumor suppressor p53 by mechanisms involving ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2
(7–9). p53 plays a primary role in mediating growth arrest and
apoptosis during DNA damage as evidenced by the finding
that thymocytes from p53/ mice do not undergo apoptosis

in response to radiation-induced DNA damage (10). This role
of p53 seems to represent its major tumor suppressor function
in view of the fact that more than half of sporadic tumors have
mutations in p53 that are exclusive of the nearly 15% of
sporadic tumors with ATM mutations (11).
Regulator of G protein signaling 6 (RGS6) is a member of
the RGS family of proteins that function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by virtue of their GTPaseactivating protein activity toward Ga subunits (12–14). A
link between RGS6 and cancer was suggested by the finding
that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the RGS6 gene,
which increases its translational efficiency about 3-fold, is
associated with an overall reduction in the risk of bladder
tumor formation (15). This risk reduction was more pronounced in smokers (40%), especially those who began
smoking at a young age (58%), suggesting a gene–environment interaction. Cigarette smoking is responsible for up to
two-thirds of bladder cancer and represents the most common mechanism of self-inflicted DNA damage (16). Thus, we
hypothesized that RGS6 might somehow function to prevent
proliferation of abnormal cells arising from DNA damage.
Recently, we discovered proapoptotic actions of RGS6 mediated by its ability to induce ROS and found that mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) lacking RGS6 exhibited an
impaired apoptotic response to DXR (17). Thus, it is of
particular interest that Guo and colleagues (18) recently
showed direct activation of ATM by ROS. Given the evidence
that RGS6 seems to protect against bladder cancers arising
from DNA damage, induces ROS that might activate ATM,
and is required for the apoptotic response to DXR, we

RGS6 Mediates Doxorubicin-Induced ATM Activation

undertook an investigation of whether RGS6 functioned to
modulate the DDR.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
MEFs were isolated from E14.5 wild-type (WT), RGS6þ/,
and RGS6/ mouse embryos by standard protocols. MEFs
and U-87 and MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin (10 U/mL). Cells were grown in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere at 37  C. Cells were transiently transfected with LipofecTAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), using the manufacturer's protocol. RGS6 cDNAs were prepared as described
previously (19). Wild-type and kinase-deficient ATM cDNAs
were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Kastan.
Luciferase assays
We amplified and cloned the human RGS6 promoter (–1,450
to þ52 bp) into pGL3 basic vector (pGL3-RGS6). U-87 and
MCF-7 cells were transfected with pGL3-RGS6 together with a
Renilla luciferase control reporter pRL-SV40 (Promega), which
was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours
after transfection, cells were treated with DXR (1 mmol/L) for 6
hours before harvesting and assay of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, using the dual luciferase assay kit (DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System 10-Pack) according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Promega).
Western blotting
Western blotting was carried out as described previously
(19). Antibodies used were green fluorescent protein (GFP;
Santa Cruz; 1:2,000), actin (Sigma; 1:2,000), p53 (Santa Cruz;
1:2,000), phospho p53(pp53)-S15 (Cell Signaling; 1:2,000),
pATM-S1981 (Cell Signaling; 1:500), and FLAG (Sigma;
1:500). Mdm2 monoclonal antibody 2A10 (1:10) was kindly
provided by Dr. Arnold Levine. RGS6 antiserum was made
previously in the laboratory (19), and the RGS6 antibody used
in Western blotting was affinity purified (20). Western blot
signals were recorded and measured with the Odyssey infrared
imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Apoptosis analysis
MEFs plated in 8-well glass coverslip chamber slides at a
density of 2,000 cells/well were grown overnight before treatment with 0.5 mmol/L DXR for 6 hours. Growth medium
was then removed, and cells were stained by the addition
of 0.5 mL of HEPES buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L KCl, and 1.8
mmol/L CaCl2) containing Annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma; 0.5 mg/mL final concentration), propidium
iodide (Sigma; 0.5 mg/mL final concentration), and Hoechst
33342 (Sigma; 2 mg/mL final concentration). After incubation
at room temperature for 15 minutes, Annexin V–positive cells
were counted under a Leica DMI6000B fluorescence microscope. We did not observe propidium iodide–positive cells,
indicating that the condition we used in this experiment did
not induce necrosis.

Comet assay and measurement of intracellular ROS
levels
MEFs of different genotypes were treated with vehicle
or DXR (0.5 mmol/L, 6 hours). Comet assay (alkaline singlecell gel assay, pH > 13) was carried out by a standard
protocol to determine DNA damage. Comet tail length
was measured with Comet Assay IV software (Perceptive
Instruments Ltd.). Measurement of intracellular ROS
levels in WT and RGS6/ MEFs with or without DXR
treatment (0.5 mmol/L, 6 hours) was done as we have
recently described (17).
Hematoxylin and eosin staining and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling staining
Two-month-old mice were treated with saline (4 WT mice
and 4 RGS6/ mice) or DXR (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally;
4 WT mice and 5 RGS6/ mice) on days 1 and 4 and sacrificed
on day 8. Five-micrometer paraffin-embedded slices of
ventricle tissues were prepared in the Central Microscopy
Research Facility (CMRF) of the University of Iowa according to standard protocol. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining following standard procedures was also carried
out in the CMRF. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was
carried out, using the TADS 2 TdT-DAB In Situ Apoptosis
Detection Kit from Trevigen, according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by Student's t test. Results were considered significantly different at P < 0.05. Values are expressed
as means  SE.

Results
DXR induces upregulation of RGS6 in cancer cells
We reasoned that expression of RGS6 might be regulated
during genotoxic stress if it functions as a positive modulator
of DDR, because RGS6 expression is low in most mitotically
active cells. Hence, we examined effects of DXR on RGS6
protein levels in human tumor cell lines. Because DXR is used
to treat breast cancer, we carried out these experiments in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells, in addition to U-87 glioma cells
where DXR also promotes apoptosis (21). MCF-7 and U-87
cells expressed low levels of RGS6 that were greatly increased
by DXR treatment (Fig. 1A). The apparent molecular mass of
the induced RGS6 protein corresponded to that of the long
(RGS6L) splice forms of RGS6 we described (19). Upregulation
of RGS6 by DXR seemed due, at least in part, to induction of
RGS6 gene transcription as shown by the ability of DXR to dose
dependently promote activation of the human RGS6 gene
promoter in MCF-7 and U-87 cells (Fig. 1B). The finding that
DXR treatment of cancer cells transcriptionally activates the
RGS6 gene and dramatically upregulates RGS6 expression is
consistent with a possible role for RGS6 in the chemotherapeutic actions of DXR.

RGS6 is required for DXR-induced phosphorylation and
upregulation of p53 in MEFs and MCF-7 breast cancer
cells
We next examined the role of endogenous RGS6 in DXRinduced p53 activation by employing MEFs from WT, RGS6þ/,
and RGS6/ mice that we recently developed (20). ATM is
activated in response to DSBs and ROS by its autophosphorylation on S1981 (22), and, once activated, ATM phosphorylates
p53 on S15, which contributes to its stabilization and upregulation (7, 8). DXR treatment induced a significant upregulation
of RGS6 in MEFs from WT and heterozygote mice, but not in
those from RGS6/ mice (Fig. 2A), confirming our evidence
that RGS6 is a key gene target of DXR. RGS6 protein levels were
stringently regulated by DXR, as RGS6 expression was undetectable in untreated MEFs of all RGS6 genotypes. Likewise,
basal levels of p53 and phospho-p53(pp53)-S15 were very low in
MEFs of all RGS6 genotypes and were dramatically increased in
response to treatment with DXR at a concentration as low as

0.25 mmol/L for 24 hours in WT and heterozygote MEFs.
Importantly, this effect was severely impaired in RGS6/
MEFs (Fig. 2A), with DXR-induced levels of pp53-S15 and total
p53 reduced by 90% or more compared with those observed in
WT and heterozygote MEFs. We then tested whether this loss
of DXR-induced p53 activation in RGS6/ MEFs could be
rescued by overexpression of RGS6L to levels comparable with
those induced by DXR in WT MEFs. Figure 2B shows that
expression of RGS6L in RGS6/ MEFs restored the ability of
DXR to induce phosphorylation and upregulate p53 to that
observed in WT MEFs, which is also illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1, summarizing the results of multiple rescue
experiments. No significant activation of p53 was observed
because of RGS6L-GFP expression in the absence of DXR. Thus,
in the absence of RGS6, there is a severe impairment in the
ability of DXR to activate and upregulate p53. These findings
also show that RGS6, as opposed to other members of the RGS
protein family, is essential in this process.
We next investigated whether RGS6 played a similar role in
cancer cells. For these studies, we evaluated effects of knockdown of RGS6 in MCF-7 cells on DXR-induced responses.
Using an RGS6-specific short hairpin RNA interference
(shRNAi-RGS6) that efficiently ablated ectopic expression of
RGS6 and one that did not (shRNAi-control), we investigated
DXR induction of RGS6 protein expression and p53 activation
in MCF-7 cells. When expressed in MCF-7 cells, shRNAi-RGS6
completely blocked DXR-induced increases in RGS6 and
largely prevented DXR-induced increases in pp53-S15
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, there were no effects of the shRNAicontrol or GFP transfection control on DXR-mediated
increases in RGS6 and pp53-S15. Thus, induced expression
of RGS6 by DXR in MCF-7 cells, as in MEFs, is required for
DXR-induced S15 phosphorylation of p53. The effect of DXR
on total p53 levels in MCF-7 cells is either small or undetectable probably due to high basal expression of p53 in these cells.
RGS6 promotes DXR-induced p53 phosphorylation by
mechanisms requiring ATM but independent of its
canonical interactions with G proteins
Subsequent studies revealed that expression of RGS6 in
MCF-7 cells was sufficient to induce p53 activation to an
otherwise ineffective dose of DXR and that RGS6 promoted
this response by mechanisms independent of G proteins. RGS6
possesses, in addition to its G protein–interacting RGS domain, Dishevelled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin (DEP) and G gamma-like
(GGL) domains that mediate binding to R7BP and Gb5 to
control localization and stability of RGS6, respectively (23, 24).
Previously, we identified numerous splice variant forms of
RGS6, some of which lack DEP and/or GGL domains (19).
Thus, we evaluated the ability of these RGS6 splice forms and a
G protein interaction–deficient mutant of RGS6 to promote
p53-S15 phosphorylation in response to a dose of DXR
(0.2 mmo/L) insufficient to both induce RGS6 and promote
DDR in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A; GFP control). As shown in Fig. 3A,
expression of RGS6L, the long form of RGS6 with intact DEP
and GGL domains, potentiated robust increases in pp53-S15 in
response to this dose of DXR. In contrast, RGS6 splice variants
lacking GGL (RGS6L-GGL) or DEP (RGS6S) or both of these

domains (RGS6S-GGL) minimally enhanced DXR-induced p53
phosphorylation. However, RGS6LN401V, a mutant form of
RGS6L that does not interact with or accelerate the GTPase
activity of Ga subunits (25), was as capable as its WT
counterpart in promoting p53 activation. The ability of
RGS6 to sensitize cells to DXR by mechanisms dependent
upon its DEP and GGL domains and independent of its
interaction with G proteins identifies an entirely novel signaling mechanism for RGS6.
Although RGS6 is clearly required for DXR-induced phosphorylation of S15 of p53, a direct target of ATM, there are
several other kinases downstream of ATM that can phosphorylate this site (26, 27). Therefore, we determined
whether RGS6 functioned upstream of ATM to promote

activation of both ATM and p53. Expression of RGS6 in
MCF-7 cells induced autophosphorylation of ATM (S1981)
and S15 of p53 in response to a low dose of DXR (0.2 mmol/L),
which alone did not produce any effects on ATM or p53
phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Coexpression of dominant-negative [kinase-deficient (KD)] ATM nearly completely blocked
these actions of RGS6, showing that RGS6 functions upstream of ATM to promote its activation and downstream
signaling. Stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage
requires ATM-mediated inactivation of the oncoprotein
Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase that acts as a major negative
regulator of p53 (9). ATM phosphorylates Mdm2 on S395,
which significantly reduces its reactivity with the monoclonal Mdm2 antibody 2A10 (28) and its ability to cause p53

tion, which leads to phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2 and
the ensuing stabilization and upregulation of p53.
RGS6 promotes DXR-induced ATM activation by
enhancing ROS generation
We undertook several studies to elucidate the mechanism
by which RGS6 promotes activation of ATM by DXR. First, we
investigated whether RGS6 somehow increased the extent of
DNA damage induced by DXR and thereby promoted ATM
activation. For these experiments, we assessed DXR-induced
DNA damage in WT and RGS6/ MEFs by COMET assays, a
sensitive method for determining DNA damage in cells in
which COMET tail length correlates directly to extent of DNA
damage (29). However, as shown in Fig. 4A, DXR produced
significantly less, rather than more, DNA damage in WT MEFs
than RGS6/ MEFs. Thus, RGS6 does not promote ATM
activation by increasing the level of DNA damage from DXR.
The higher level of DXR-induced DNA damage in RGS6/
MEFs is likely due to impaired repair of DNA from loss of ATM
activation in these cells (Fig. 3C). Second, we examined
whether RGS6 might activate ATM by mechanisms involving
ROS. This possibility was suggested by recent evidence that
RGS6 induces apoptosis by generation of ROS (17) and that
ROS can directly activate ATM (18). Moreover, it has long been
known that DXR induces ROS (4), and Kurz and colleagues
(30) showed that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53
(S15) and p53 binding to its cognate DNA binding site in
response to DXR is ROS dependent. Figure 4B shows that a
brief treatment of MEFs with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), an ROS
scavenger that significantly inhibits RGS6-induced ROS (17)
and ROS-induced ATM activation (18), significantly blocked
DXR-induced increases in pATM-S1981, pp53-S15, and total
p53 in WT MEFs as well as in RGS6/ MEFs in which RGS6
was expressed to rescue the DDR. Similarly, NAC blocked
RGS6-dependent phosphorylation of ATM and p53 in MCF-7
cells with a DXR dose that alone is ineffective in promoting
these responses (Fig. 4C). DXR-induced ROS generation is
significantly lower in RGS6/ MEFs than WT MEFs (Fig. 4D),
indicating that DXR-induced ROS generation is mediated, in
part, by RGS6. Together, these findings provide new evidence
that RGS6 promotes DXR-induced activation of ATM by
enhancing ROS generation.
RGS6 is required for DXR-induced apoptosis both in
isolated cells and in vivo
Activation of the DDR can induce either cell-cycle arrest,
which allows for higher fidelity repair of DSBs by homologous
recombination, or apoptosis if damage is insurmountable. The
therapeutic efficacy of DXR relies largely upon its ability to kill
severely damaged cells. Because RGS6 is required for DXRinduced DDR (ATM and p53) activation, we next assessed the
role of RGS6 in DXR-induced apoptosis in WT and RGS6/
MEFs. MEFs of both genotypes were treated with DXR as in
Fig. 3C. Figure 5A shows that loss of RGS6 in MEFs dramatically impairs the early apoptotic response to DXR assessed by
Annexin V staining. These results are consistent with our
previous finding that RGS6 enhances apoptotic signaling
initiated by DXR (17).

www.aacrjournals.org

To confirm the significance of RGS6 to DXR-induced cell
death in vivo, we compared DXR-induced cardiotoxicity in WT
and RGS6/ mice. The major limitation to DXR use is its
induction of life-threatening cardiotoxicity, mediated by the
same ATM–p53 DNA damage pathway responsible for its
tumor-killing actions (31). Reduction of p53 activity by generation of dominant-negative p53 transgenic mice, by genetic
disruption of the gene, or via chemical inhibition protects
against DXR-induced heart injuries in mice (32–34). On the
basis of our finding that RGS6 is essential for DXR-induced p53
activation and the pivotal role of p53 in DXR-induced cardiotoxicity, we hypothesized that loss of RGS6 will prevent or
dramatically reduce DXR-induced heart injury. DXR treatment
of WT mice induced marked apoptosis of ventricular cells and
ventricular damage, which were dramatically reduced (Fig. 5B
and C) and absent (Fig. 5D), respectively, in RGS6/ mice.
Together our results show the requirement of RGS6 for
the ability of DXR to induce cell death both in isolated cells
and in vivo.

Discussion
This study reveals a novel and significant role of RGS6 in
DXR-induced activation of the ATM–p53 apoptosis pathway
that underlies the chemotherapeutic actions of DXR. Loss of
RGS6 severely impaired ATM and p53 activation in response to
DXR, as well as DXR-induced apoptosis in cells and in the heart
in vivo. Importantly, the ability of RGS6 to promote DXRinduced ATM activation and p53 upregulation is independent
of its canonical actions as a G protein regulator. Instead, RGS6
promoted DXR-induced ATM activation by enhancing DXRinduced ROS generation, in keeping with the recent discovery
that ATM can be directly activated by ROS (18) and our finding
that RGS6 promotes apoptosis by mechanisms involving ROS
generation (17). Importantly, this mechanism seems to represent the major means by which DXR promotes ATM and p53
activation, as most of this response is dependent upon RGS6
and ROS (Fig. 4B). Although RGS6 enhancement of ROS
generation could also lead to DSBs to activate ATM, we found
less DNA damage in response to DXR in WT versus RGS6/
MEFs (Fig. 4A). Moreover, increased DNA damage in RGS6/
MEFs did not enhance ATM activation (Fig. 3C), indicating
that DNA damage is not the major mechanism for DXRinduced ATM activation in these cells. Therefore, our findings
are consistent with a direct activation of ATM by RGS6induced ROS. We cannot exclude the possibility that RGS6
might also enhance ROS-mediated ATM activation because
loss of RGS6 led to larger decreases in DXR-induced ATM
activation than it did on DXR-induced ROS generation (Fig. 4B
and D). Our results further suggest that RGS6-dependent activation of ATM leads to phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2,
which promotes stabilization and upregulation of p53 by

model in which RGS6 plays an essential role in DXR-induced
activation of ATM and p53 as illustrated in Fig. 6.
The possibility that RGS6 might somehow modulate DNA
damage signaling to either kill badly damaged cells or
stimulate DNA repair was suggested by the finding that a

insurmountable DNA damage, our results show that the
recently described activation of ATM by ROS (18) is also
critical for these downstream actions of ATM in response to
a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. The key finding that
RGS6 is a dramatic modulator of this response is entirely
consistent with the findings suggesting that increased expression of RGS6 protects against bladder cancer risk from
smoking, which induces ROS generation and DNA damage.
Further work will be required to determine whether RGS6
functions to activate ATM to prevent genetic instability and
cellular transformation in situations other than during DXR
treatment. It is well known that ROS is generated during
normal metabolism as well as during exposure to environmental agents including DXR that can induce oxidation of
DNA bases and cause DNA breaks (4, 11). The present
findings raise the possibility that RGS6 has a role in ROSinduced ATM activation in such situations. In this regard, we
recently provided new evidence for a tumor suppressor role

of RGS6 in breast cancer (17). RGS6 had powerful apoptotic
actions in breast cancer cells, and its loss in ductal epithelial
cells correlates with cancer progression (17). RGS6 expression is also dramatically lost in both human glioma and
bladder cancer (Stewart and Assem, unpublished data).
Together, these findings and the present results suggest
that loss or mutations in RGS6 may have severe consequences including tumor formation and their resistance
to treatment with DXR.
The rapid induction of RGS6 expression by DXR and its G
protein–independent mechanism of mediating DXR-induced
p53 activation are unexpected for a member of the RGS family
of proteins. Expression of RGS proteins is usually under tight
regulation because these proteins are strong negative
regulators of G protein signaling. RGS6 indeed possesses
G protein–regulating actions in vivo as shown by its essential
role as a negative regulator of G protein activation of GIRK
channels mediating bradycardic responses to acetylcholine in

Figure 6. Schematic illustration of the role of RGS6 in DXR-induced DDR.
The antitumor activity of DXR is mediated by its ability to activate DDR,
especially the ATM–p53 pathway, which ultimately leads to apoptosis of
severely damaged cells. Our study reveals an essential role of RGS6 in
DXR-induced activation of the ATM–p53 pathway. RGS6 promotes DXRinduced generation of ROS, which directly activates the ATM–p53
pathway. RGS6 might also promote ROS-induced activation of ATM, as
loss of RGS6 in MEFs had a greater effect on DXR-induced ATM activation
than DXR-induced ROS generation. In contradiction to the canonical
theory that DXR activates ATM primarily by promoting DNA damage
(DSBs) either directly or indirectly (via ROS), our study shows that the
major mechanism by which DXR activates ATM is via ROS (black
arrows) and that DNA damage has only a minor effect (gray arrow) on ATM
activation. dsDNA, double-stranded DNA.

heart (20). Here, we found that DXR induced robust increases
in RGS6 protein expression in both cancer cells and MEFs.
Although DXR increased transcription of the human RGS6
promoter, it seems likely that posttranscriptional mechanisms
are also involved in RGS6 upregulation because DXR promoted maximal increases in RGS6 protein levels at the earliest
times we have measured (2–3 hours; data not shown). The fact
that RGS6 expression is so dramatically increased actually
points to a novel function for RGS6, as such increases are not
at all consistent or expected for its role in regulating G protein
signaling. Thus, it is especially intriguing that RGS6 mediates

DXR-induced p53 activation by mechanisms dependent upon
its GGL and DEP domains but not its G protein–interacting
RGS domain. RGS6 is a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS
proteins that includes RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11 (35). The
crystal structure of the RGS9–Gb5 complex was recently
elucidated (36). In this structure, the RGS9 GGL domain
bound to Gb5 is sandwiched between its DEP and RGS
domains creating 2 distinct surfaces, one for interaction with
Ga subunits and one important for interactions with Gb5 and
the DEP domain. RGS6 likely shares an overall similar structural organization with RGS9. If so, our findings suggest that
the important face of RGS6 for promoting DDR is on the
opposite side of its Ga subunit binding RGS domain. Thus, our
findings define a novel functional role of RGS6 that depends
upon structural elements quite separate from those employed
for its canonical action as a G protein regulator.
In summary, this work identifies a novel signaling action of
RGS6 that is required for the ability of one of the most effective
and widely employed chemotherapeutic agents to promote
cellular responses that kill cancer cells. Importantly, RGS6
functions as a key modulator of DXR-induced ATM activation
by mechanisms unrelated to its canonical function as a G
protein regulator, broadening our understanding of RGS
protein function. Our findings provide new evidence that
the recently described activation of ATM by ROS (18) plays
a major role in how DXR activates p53, and we found that
RGS6 has a central role in this new ATM activation mechanism. In view of these findings and the ability of RGS6 to
sensitize cancer cells to otherwise ineffective doses of DXR,
the present findings identify RGS6 as a prominent therapeutic
target for the treatment of cancer.
