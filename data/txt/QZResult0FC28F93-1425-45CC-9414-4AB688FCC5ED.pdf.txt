Abstract
The Wilms’ tumor 1 gene (WT1) encodes a transcription factor
involved in cell growth and development. As we previously
reported, WT1 expression is hardly detectable in normal
hepatic tissue but is induced in liver cirrhosis. Although WT1
has been found to be overexpressed in a number of
malignancies, the role of WT1 in hepatocarcinogenesis has
not been clarified. We found that WT1 is expressed in several
human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, including
PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2, and in HCC tumor tissue in 42% of
patients. WT1 small interfering RNAs did not affect proliferation rate of HCC cells but abrogated their resistance to
anoikis. Transcriptome analysis of PLC/PRF/5 cells after WT1
knockdown showed up-regulation of 251 genes and downregulation of 321. Ninety percent of the former corresponded
to metabolic genes, mostly those characterizing the mature
hepatocyte phenotype. On the contrary, genes that decreased
upon WT1 inhibition were mainly related to defense against
apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumor progression. In agreement
with these findings, WT1 expression increased the resistance
of liver tumor cells to doxorubicin, a compound used to treat
HCC. Interestingly, doxorubicin strongly enhanced WT1
expression in both HCC cells and normal human hepatocytes.
Among different chemotherapeutics, induction of WT1 transcription was restricted to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors. When
WT1 expression was prohibited, doxorubicin caused a marked
increase in caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, WT1 is
expressed in a substantial proportion of HCC contributing to
tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting that WT1 may be an important target for HCC treatment.

Introduction

alternative start codons and RNA editing may give raise to the
generation of 24 different isoforms (3). The role of WT1 in cell
biology is equally complex, and it has been shown that the
repression or activation function of WT1 is dependent on the cell
type and on its level of expression (3). Moreover, WT1 has been
described as a tumor suppressor and as an oncogene (1, 3). During
the last years, accumulating evidence shows that overexpression of
WT1 exerts an oncogenic effect in different forms of tumors (1, 4, 5),
and in fact, high levels of WT1 have been linked to poor prognosis in
leukemia and breast cancer (6, 7).
In the adult, WT1 is detected in the kidney, mesothelium, ovary,
and testis (8). In the liver, WT1 is expressed during the fetal stage of
development but not after birth (9). Although WT1 is not found in
the healthy adult liver, it is detected in the nuclei of hepatocytes in
patients with chronic hepatitis and significant fibrosis and, at high
levels, in the cirrhotic liver (9). We found that transforming growth
factor-h is a key factor that promotes the expression of WT1 in
hepatocytes. Also, we observed that WT1 was able to downregulate HNF4 in parenchymal liver cells, which may contribute to
the loss of specific hepatocellular functions and to the development of hepatic insuficiency in cirrhotic patients (9).
In this work, we show that WT1 is also expressed in tumor tissue
in a high proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), a finding that is in agreement with a very recent report from
Japan showing positive immunohistochemical staining in 95% of
HCC specimens (10). Although in this report, the authors observed
a correlation between WT1 expression and patient survival, there
are no data showing the implication of WT1 in HCC biology. Here,
we show that WT1 knockdown in HCC cells reduces antiapoptotic
genes and genes favoring cell dedifferentiation, whereas this
maneuver enhances the expression of genes that characterize the
mature hepatocyte phenotype. Moreover, we show that the
inhibition of WT1 expression increases the sensitivity of the cells
to chemotherapeutic compounds such as doxorubicin. Interestingly, we also observed that among different chemotherapeutic
compounds topoisomerase 2 (Topo2) inhibitors used in the
treatment of HCC were able to promote WT1 gene expression in
liver cancer cells. These data implicate WT1 in HCC progression
and resistance to chemotherapy.

Wilms’ tumor 1 gene (WT1) is an important nuclear factor
involved in organ development and cell growth (1). In addition to
regulate nuclear transcription, WT1 is involved in RNA splicing and
metabolism (2, 3). WT1 encodes for 10 exons and generates various
mRNA species. There are 2 main splicing events: one causing the
splicing of exon 5 and the other leading to the splicing of 9
nucleotides at the 3¶end of exon 9 (codifying for lysine, threonine,
and serine: KTS). These splicing events, together with the use of

bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Human hepatocytes were from
CellzDirect and were cultured in Williams’ E medium supplemented as
above. Cells were treated with doxorubicin (Sigma), etoposide (VP-16; Teva
Pharmaceuticals), merbarone (Merb; Calbiochem), cisplatin (CDDP; Chiesi
Farmaceutici), or topotecan (Topot; GlaxoSmithKline). Reduced glutathione
mono-ethyl ester (E-GSH), catalase (CATA), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and
deferoxamine (DFO) were from Sigma. UV-C irradiation (254 nm) was
performed using an UV cross-linker from UVItec Ltd.
RNA interference. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting different
regions of the human WT1 gene (siWT1) were from Sigma (exons 4 and 10)
or from Dharmacon Research (exon 7). Control siRNA (siGL) was from
Dharmacon Research. Transfections with the different siRNA duplexes were
carried out with the Dharmafect reagent as recommended by manufacturer
(Dharmacon Research). Silencing of WT1 was confirmed by quantitative
real-time PCR and Western blotting.
Microarray analysis. Microarray data were analyzed using RMA (Robust
Multichip Average) algorithm (11). Linear Models for Microarray Data (12)
was used to find probesets with differential expression between experimental conditions. We have followed the Minimum Information About a
Microarray Gene Experiment guidelines, and deposited the microarray raw
data in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression
Omnibus, accession number GSE12886.
Cell growth and apoptosis assays. Cell proliferation and viability was
estimated using the WST-1 reagent (Roche) as reported (13). Apoptosis was
estimated with the Cell Death Detection Assay (Roche) as described (14).
Anchorage-independent growth was evaluated as described (13).
RNA isolation and analysis of gene expression. Total RNA was
extracted using the TRI Reagent (Sigma). Reverse transcription and realtime PCR were carried out as reported (14). The amount of each transcript
was expressed as the n-fold difference relative to the control gene h-actin
(2DCt; ref. 14). Primers for WT1 amplification were as described (9).
Transient transfections. Hep3B cells were transfected as described (9)
with an equimolar mixture of pCV5 plasmids encoding the four major
isoforms of WT1 kindly provided by Dr. Jochemsen (Leiden University
Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). Hep3B and Huh7 cells were
transfected as described (9) with the pCAT-proximal-promoter plasmid
encompassing 0.65 kb of the 5¶ region of human WT1 gene (15), kindly
provided by Dr. Frazier (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).
Reporter gene expression was assessed by measuring CAT mRNA levels by
real-time PCR.
Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. Cell lysis and Western blotting were performed as reported (13).
Antibodies used were as follows: 9664S for caspase-3 p17 subunit and 9718
for phosphorylated histone H2A (Ser139; gH2AX) from Cell Signaling;
AB17003 antibody from Chemicon for Bim. Equal loading was shown with
an anti-histone H4 antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-actin antibody
(Calbiochem). Immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and Western
blot analysis of WT1 were performed as reported (9) with antibody C19
(Santa Cruz) and a preimmune rabbit IgG as control (Santa Cruz).
Statistical analysis. Normally distributed data were compared among
groups using the Student’s t test. Nonnormally distributed data were
compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Data are means F SE. Unless
otherwise indicated experiments were performed at least twice in
duplicates. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Expression of WT1 in human HCC tissues and HCC cell
lines. The expression of WT1 was assessed by real-time PCR in
samples from control livers and HCC tissues. As shown in Fig. 1A,
the average level of WT1 gene expression was significantly higher
in HCC tissues than in control livers (614.2 F 190.0 versus 80.0 F
27.0 P < 0.01, mRNA levels expressed in arbitrary units). In
agreement with our previous observations (9), WT1 expression was
very low or undetectable in most control tissue samples. However,
WT1 mRNA was detected in all but two HCC samples and showed

www.aacrjournals.org

high expression in f40% of tumor tissue samples. In all but one of
these tumor samples with high WT1 expression, the levels of WT1
mRNA were higher than in the surrounding nontumoral tissue
(data not shown). To further characterize the status of WT1 in
human HCC, we cloned WT1 cDNAs from a representative number
of tumors (n = 9). Upon sequencing, we did not find any mutations
in these cDNAs, and we could detect the presence of isoforms
including and excluding both exon 5 and the KTS epitope in all
HCC samples. In agreement with the gene expression data,
immunohistochemical analysis of control and HCC tissues showed
intense WT1 immunoreactivity in neoplastic hepatocytes, whereas
WT1 staining was undetectable in normal liver (Fig. 1A, bottom). As
we previously observed in the cirrhotic liver tissue, WT1
immunoreactivity localized mainly to the nuclei, although some
staining was also evident in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Fig. 1A).
We also tested whether high WT1 mRNA levels were accompanied
by enhanced WT1 immunostaining in HCC tissues. To this end, we
examined three HCC samples with high and three HCC samples
with low WT1 mRNA levels. In agreement with a recent report (10)
describing a close correlation between WT1 mRNA and protein
expression in liver tumors, we found that those HCC samples with
higher WT1 mRNA levels also showed enhanced WT1 immunostaining. These observations, together with our previous findings in
chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (9), indicate that WT1 expression in
the liver is associated with chronic tissue injury and neoplastic
transformation, situations in which liver parenchymal cells display
enhanced proliferation. To evaluate whether WT1 up-regulation
could be related to hepatocellular proliferation, we examined WT1
expression in rat liver samples taken at different time points after
partial hepatectomy. We did not observe up-regulation of WT1
gene expression under this condition in which active proliferation
of parenchymal cells occurs (data not shown). Next, we examined
WT1 expression in human HCC cell lines. We could identify two
groups of HCC cell lines, one with high WT1 expression, which
included HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells, and another with very low
levels of WT1 mRNA including Huh7 and Hep3B cells (Fig. 1B,
inset). Immunocytochemical analyses confirmed the gene expression data by showing intense WT1 staining in HepG2 and PLC/
PRF/5 cell lines, which was mainly localized to the cell nuclei
(Fig. 1B, bottom).
Role of WT1 in HCC cell growth and survival. To examine the
potential role of WT1 in HCC cells, we knocked down WT1
expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection
of PLC/PRF/5 cells with siRNAs targeting WT1 exons 7 and 10
resulted in a significant reduction in WT1 mRNA levels. A similar
down-regulation of WT1 expression was obtained when exons 4
and 10 were simultaneously targeted (data not shown). Downregulation of WT1 mRNA was accompanied by a significant
reduction in WT1 protein levels (Fig. 2B). When we examined the
growth under standard conditions of PLC/PRF/5 cells transfected
with siWT1 or control siGL siRNAs, we did not appreciate any
significant differences (Fig. 2C). Similar observations were made in
HepG2 cells (data not shown). We also tested the anchorageindependent growth of HCC cells in which WT1 expression was
down-regulated. As shown in Fig. 2D, PLC/PRF/5 siWT1 transfectants presented significantly inhibited anchorage-independent
growth in soft-agar compared with control cultures transfected
with siGL (control siRNAs). This inhibitory effect was observed
with different combinations of WT1-specific siRNAs: siWT1 A,
targeting exons 4 and 10; siWT1 B, targeting exons 7 and 10; and
siWT1 C, targeting exons 4, 7, and 10. These findings indicate that

WT1 expression it is essential to preserve the viability of liver
tumor cells grown under nonadherent conditions.
Analysis of the influence of WT1 expression on the HCC cell
transcriptome. To gain further insight on the influence of WT1
gene expression on HCC cell biology, and to learn about the
mechanisms behind its survival-promoting effects, we performed a
microarray transcriptome analysis in PLC/PRF/5 cells transfected
with siWT1 (siWT B) or control siGL siRNAs. Total RNA was
isolated after 72 hours of transfections, and samples were
hybridized on Affymetrix HG-U133-Plus-2 Chips. Microarray data
analysis identified a total of 251 genes up-regulated and 321 genes
inhibited upon WT1 silencing. By analysis with the Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis Network, we found that the significantly upregulated genes were mainly involved in metabolic pathways,
including lipid, amino acid, and vitamin metabolism, as well as cell
death and cancer (Supplementary Table S1). The inhibited genes
were mostly associated with cellular development and cell cycle,
and also with cell death and cancer (Supplementary Table S1). The
differential expression of specific genes, selected by their potential
physiopathologic significance and/or the magnitude of their
change upon WT1 silencing, was validated by quantitative realtime PCR. This was done in the same RNA samples used for
microarray analysis, and also in samples from independent

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

transfections. The results were reproducible in both sets of samples
and are shown in Fig. 3A and B. Same data were obtained in HepG2
cells (data not shown). Up-regulated genes upon WT1 silencing
included markers of hepatocellular differentiation such as HNF4,
albumin, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
Conversely, WT1 knockdown reduced the expression of genes
related to HCC disease progression and cell survival such as
insulin-like growth factor binding protein1 (IGFBP1), H19, Tbx3,
BclX, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Aurora kinase-2, and
ID1, among others. Together, these observations further confirm
the involvement of WT1 in promoting hepatocellular dedifferentiation, and contribute to explain apoptosis resistance in HCC cells.
Down-regulation of WT1 expression sensitized HCC cells to
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. The ability to evade apoptosis
induced by chemotherapeutic agents is a common trait of HCC
cells; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. We tested the influence of WT1 expression on apoptosis
induced by the clinically relevant chemotherapeutic doxorubicin.
Down-regulation of WT1 expression by itself had only a modest
effect on cell survival; however, WT1 knockdown markedly
sensitized both PLC/PRF/5 (Fig. 4A) and HepG2 cells (data not
shown) to apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. The levels of the
active caspase-3 p17 subunit correlated well with the extent of

WT1 in Hepatocarcinogenesis and Doxorubicin Resistance

apoptosis induced by WT1 silencing and doxorubicin treatment
(Fig. 4B). BH3-only proteins such as Bim prime HCC cells for
apoptosis elicited by cytotoxic drugs, including doxorubicin (16,
17). We observed that enhancement of HCC cell apoptosis upon
WT1 silencing in PLC/PRF/5 cells was accompanied by the upregulation of Bim (Fig. 4B). Drug resistance in tumor cells,
including HCC cells, is also associated with the expression of the
multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene (18). Moreover, repetitive
treatment with doxorubicin is known to enhance multidrug
resistance of cancer cells (19). These notions prompted us to test
whether WT1 could contribute to the expression of the MDR1
gene. To this end, we undertook two complementary approaches.
First, we measured MDR1 gene expression upon doxorubicin
treatment in PLC/PRF/5 cells transfected with control (siGL) or
WT1-specific (siWT1) siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 4C, the upregulation of MDR1 elicited by doxorubicin was significantly
inhibited when WT1 was knocked down. Conversely, in Hep3B
cells, transfection with an equimolar mixture of plasmids encoding
the four major isoforms of WT1 elicited a clear induction of MDR1
gene expression (Fig. 4D).
The expression of WT1 can be induced by Topo2 inhibitors
in HCC cells and primary human hepatocytes. Activation of
survival mechanisms in normal and transformed cells is a common
adaptive response to cell stress caused by a variety of agents,

including chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (17, 19, 20). We
have shown above that WT1 expression confers resistance to cell
death in HCC cells. To further examine the involvement of WT1 in
the response of liver tumor cells to cytotoxic compounds, we
measured WT1 gene expression in four HCC cell lines upon
treatment. We found that doxorubicin significantly up-regulated
WT1 mRNA levels not only in PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells but also
in Huh7 and Hep3B cells, which displayed very low basal levels of
WT1 mRNA (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, this response was not restricted
to transformed cells because doxorubicin also elicited WT1 gene
expression in normal cultured human hepatocytes (Fig. 5A).
Induction of WT1 gene expression by doxorubicin was further
characterized in Hep3B cells. We found that doxorubicin effects on
WT1 transcription were dose- and time-dependent, with a potent
induction of the gene at doses as low as 50 ng/mL (Fig. 5B).
Although we cannot exclude potential effects of doxorubicin on
WT1 mRNA stability, we showed that doxorubicin was able to
transactivate the proximal WT1 gene promoter (15). We showed
this in transient transfection experiments with a reporter CAT gene
under the control of WT1 proximal promoter in Hep3B and Huh7
cells (Fig. 5C). In view of these findings, we wanted to know
whether WT1 up-regulation upon doxorubicin treatment could
participate in chemoresistance. To this end, Hep3B cells were first
transfected with either control siGL or siWT1 siRNAs, and

supplemented with 10% FCS (104 per plate). After 4 wk, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted.

subsequently treated with doxorubicin. We observed that the
apoptotic response to doxorubicin, as indicated by caspase-3
activation and elevated Bim protein levels, was more prominent
when WT1 up-regulation was prevented (Fig. 5D).
We have also examined the potential mechanisms through which
doxorubicin may stimulate WT1 gene expression. Doxorubicin has
complex biological activities, including the generation of free
radicals and the induction of DNA damage (21). As shown in
Fig. 6A, doxorubicin-induced up-regulation of WT1 gene expression in Hep3B cells was unaffected in the presence of different free
radicals scavengers. Doxorubicin treatment may also trigger DNA
damage and genotoxic stress through the interference with Topo2
(21). We observed that WT1 expression elicited by relatively low
concentrations of doxorubicin was indeed accompanied by the upregulation of p21 and the phosphorylation of histone H2AX
(gH2AX), both hallmarks of DNA damage (Fig. 6B; ref. 22). This led
us to examine whether other genotoxic agents could modulate
WT1 gene expression. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment with the Top1
inhibitor Topot, the cytotoxic compound CDDP, or the exposure to
UV irradiation had no effect on WT1 expression, whereas all three
elicited a genotoxic response as shown by increased p21 and
gH2AX levels (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these observations suggest that
WT1 induction in HCC cells is not mediated through the DNA
damage response pathway. Furthermore, WT1 induction in HCC
cells seems to be a specific response to doxorubicin, and not to
other chemotherapeutic agents such as Topot and CDDP (Fig. 6B),
or 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine (data not shown). Top2 is a

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

major target of doxorubicin, to confirm whether WT1 induction
could be dependent on interference with this enzyme, we tested
other Top2 inhibitors. Figure 6C shows that WT1 up-regulation was
induced in Hep3B cells treated with VP-16 or Merb, two different
Top2 inhibitors. The effects of VP-16 and Merb on WT1 expression
were reproduced in normal cultured human hepatocytes (data not
shown). Contrary to doxorubicin and VP-16, Merb is a catalytic
inhibitor of Top2, a kind of inhibitors that do not induce significant
DNA damage (23). Consistent with this, we observed that Merb did
not elicit p21 expression or gH2AX levels (Fig. 6C) but still
triggered WT1 gene expression. This finding further confirms that
WT1 up-regulation is independent from DNA damage but requires
Top2 inhibition. Top2 inhibitors are known to promote the
proteasome-mediated degradation of this enzyme (24). In agreement with this, we observed that treatment of Hep3B cells with VP16 or Merb significantly reduced the protein levels of the two
isozymes Top2a and Top2h (Fig. 6D). However, doxorubicin
treatment did not reduce Top2 protein levels (Fig. 6D), suggesting
that the effect of this drug on WT1 gene expression is dependent
on the inhibition of Top2 enzymatic activity but not on the cellular
Top2 protein contents.

Discussion
Previously, we reported that WT1 is not expressed in normal
liver but it is induced in patients with chronic liver injury and
cirrhosis (9), conditions associated with HCC development (25). In

WT1 in Hepatocarcinogenesis and Doxorubicin Resistance

the present work, we found that WT1 is overexpressed in 2 of 4
HCC cell lines analyzed and in tumor tissue in 42% of patients with
HCC. Overall, these observations are in agreement with a very
recent report that examined WT1 expression in HCC tissues (10).
To evaluate the functional role of WT1 in liver cancer, we
performed knockdown experiments in cells with high WT1
expression. In contrast to what has been reported in other types
of tumors, such as leukemia and breast cancer cells (1, 5), neither in
PLC/PRF/5 nor in HepG2 cells WT1 suppression modified cell
proliferation. However, abrogation of WT1 expression markedly
reduced the aggressiveness of HCC cells, as shown by the impaired
anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. The ability to survive
and grow under nonadhesive conditions by inhibiting anoikisrelated apoptotic pathways is a characteristic of transformed cells
that is absent in normal epithelial cells (26). To investigate the
mechanisms through which WT1 could mediate its prosurvival
effects, we carried out a genome-wide expression profile analysis in
PLC/PRF/5 cells after WT1 silencing. Among the genes that

expression was down-regulated upon WT1 silencing, we found
several candidates with antiapoptotic activity, such as the Bcl-2
family members Bcl-w and Bcl-X (26), or DEC1 a potent inhibitor of
apoptosis overexpressed in colon carcinoma cells (27). Other
antiapoptotic genes that were dependent on WT1 expression
included the transcriptional repressor Tbx3 (28) and IGFBP1 (29),
both recently described to enhance the survival of HCC cells, and
the immediate early response gene X-1, a stress-inducible gene that
codes for an intracellular membrane-associated protein with
prosurvival properties (30). Interestingly, the protective mechanisms associated with WT1 expression were not only dependent on
the expression of intracellular prosurvival genes. Indeed, WT1
silencing compromised the expression of growth and survival
factors such as epiregulin (Ereg), cysteine-rich61, and CTGF,
secretable mediators previously associated with cytoprotection
and HCC development, which can function in an autocrine or
paracrine manner on transformed cells (14, 31, 32). Other WT1dependent genes up-regulated in liver cancer, and that are relevant

Figure 5. Doxorubicin up-regulates WT1 gene expression in human HCC cells and normal hepatocytes. A, PLC/PRF/5, HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, and normal human
hepatocytes (Hu-Hepat ) were treated with doxorubicin at 0.25 Ag/mL during 24 h, and mRNA levels of WT1 were measured by real-time PCR. Data are means of

to the development and prognosis of this disease, included the
serine/threonine kinase Aurora-A (33), the inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding protein 1 (ID1; ref. 34), connexin 43 (GJA1;
ref. 35), PEA3/ETV4 (36), and DNA-methyltransferase 3b (37).
Interestingly, silencing of WT1 expression in HCC cells resulted in
the induction of a number of genes characteristic of the adult and
differentiated hepatocyte that are progressively down-regulated
during carcinogenesis. These included albumin, transthyretin,
alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, DHEA sulfotransferase (SULT2A1), the EGFR, and HNF4 (38, 39). Although some of
the differentially expressed genes, such as Ereg, H19, CTGF, Egr1,
and the EGFR, are recognized transcriptional targets of WT1 (1, 8,
40, 41), most of the genes identified in our study have not been
functionally linked to WT1, and therefore may be indirect targets of
this transcription factor. Indeed, many of the modified genes upon
WT1 silencing were transcription factors such as Egr1, ID1, PEA3,
and DEC1, the alteration of which may effect on a wide range of
target genes. In normal hepatocytes, we have previously shown that
WT1 represses the expression of HNF4 (9), a crucial factor for the
maintenance of metabolic functions typical of differentiated
parenchymal liver cells (38). Thus, it seems possible that a
repressor effect of WT1 on key liver-enriched transcription factors

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

such as HNF4 may mediate and amplify some of the effects of WT1
that contribute to cellular dedifferentiation. This would be also in
agreement with the developmentally regulated expression of WT1,
which is detected in the fetal hepatocyte but is subsequently lost in
the adult cell (9). Together these data suggest that in the HCC cell
WT1 is sustaining a gene expression program leading to resistance
to apoptosis, dedifferentiation and tumor progression.
Another relevant finding in this study was the protective effect
exerted by WT1 on apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic
agent doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is frequently used in the treatment
of HCC, although the observed response rate is only around 10%
(42). The resistance toward doxorubicin toxicity granted by WT1
may be attributed in part to the WT1-dependent expression of
genes, such as Tbx3, recently reported to protect from apoptosis
induced by this drug (27). However, although it was not detected in
our microarray analysis, here, we show that WT1 was able to
promote the expression of the MDR1 gene in HCC cells. MDR1
codes for the drug-transporting membrane-bound P-glycoprotein, a
key gene in doxorubicin resistance (18, 19). The mechanisms
involved in WT1 regulation of MDR1 expression in HCC cells are
not fully understood at the moment. These may include a direct
interaction of WT1 with MDR1 promoter as described in leukemia

cells (43), or could involve indirect mechanisms such as the
expression of H19, an inducer of MDR1 transcription in liver cancer
cells (18) identified in our microarray experiments as a WT1dependent gene.
Of interest was also the observation that doxorubicin can
stimulate WT1 gene transcription in HCC cells. This was observed
in all four cell lines tested but most prominently in those with low
basal levels of WT1 mRNA. This may imply that although WT1
gene expression is detected in a subset of human HCC samples,
perhaps all liver tumors may become WT1 positive upon
doxorubicin treatment. These findings suggest that WT1 could
play an important role in the acquisition of drug resistance in HCC.
We have addressed the potential mechanisms responsible for
WT1 up-regulation by doxorubicin. The biological effects of
doxorubicin have been essentially attributed to two mechanisms.
Being an anthraquinone, it has redox cycling ability leading to the
formation of free radical species (21). On the other hand,
doxorubicin is a potent inhibitor of Top2 isozymes, Top2a and
Top2h, and induces the formation of stable Top2-doxorubicin-DNA
complexes capable of producing double DNA strand breaks, having

thus a genotoxic effect (21, 22, 44). The involvement of reactive free
radicals was ruled out when we observed that doxorubicin-mediated
up-regulation of WT1 was unaffected in the presence of antioxidant
compounds. We could also dissociate the production of DNA
damage from the activation of WT1 gene expression. We observed
that other DNA-damaging agents, including other chemotherapeutic
compounds and UV radiation, had no effect on WT1 mRNA levels.
Moreover, induction of WT1 gene expression seemed to be restricted
to Top2 inhibitors, including those that did not elicit genotoxic
stress. Top2a is mainly expressed in proliferating cells and plays
important roles in cell cycle events such as DNA replication (45).
However Top2h is present in all cells, including quiescent cells,
and recent reports have shown an important role for this enzyme
in gene expression regulation (46–48). For instance, Top2h has been
described to negatively modulate the expression of retinoic acid
receptor-h through a direct interaction with the promoter of this
gene (48). However, we were unable to detect the association of
Top2h with WT1 promoter by ChIP assay (data not shown). On
the other hand, Top2h enzymatic activity, in cooperation with
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1), has been recently shown

Figure 6. Characterization of WT1 up-regulation by doxorubicin in Hep3B cells. A, effect of antioxidant compounds on doxorubicin-mediated WT1 induction. Hep3B
cells were pretreated for 30 min with E-GSH (2 mmol/L), DFO (180 Amol/L), NAC (1 mmol/L), or CATA (1,000 U/mL), and subsequently with doxorubicin (0.25 Ag/mL)
for 24 h. WT1 mRNA levels were then measured by real-time PCR. B, assessment of WT1 gene expression and genotoxic stress in Hep3B cells treated with
cytotoxic drugs or UV radiation. Hep3B cells were treated with doxorubicin (0.25 Ag/mL), Topot (5 Amol/L), CDDP (20 Amol/L), or UV radiation at the indicated doses.
After 24 h WT1 and p21 gene expression were measured by real-time PCR. Bottom, the levels of gH2AX as analyzed by Western blotting in samples of Hep3B
lysates treated as described above. C, up-regulation of WT1 gene expression by Top2 inhibitors is independent from the generation of genotoxic stress. Hep3B
cells were treated for 24 h with doxorubicin (0.25 Ag/mL), VP-16 (50 Amol/L), or Merb (100 Amol/L). WT1 expression was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR.
Subsequently WT1 and p21 gene expression were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR (left ), and gH2AX levels were determined by Western blotting (right ).

to participate in the activation of gene transcription through the
generation of transient site-specific double stranded DNA breaks
(47). At this point, we could speculate that WT1 transcription
would normally be under the negative control of an intermediary
gene, the expression of which is in turn dependent on Top2
activity (or on Top2/PARP-1 enzymatic complexes). Inhibition of
Top2 by molecules such as doxorubicin would shut off the
expression of that intermediary gene and result in WT1 upregulation. In support of the existence of an active repressor of
WT1 transcription in liver cells is the observation that WT1 gene
expression in Hep3B cells can be induced by treatment with the
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (data not shown).
Furthermore, we have also observed that the PARP-1 inhibitor
3-aminobenzamide also promotes WT1 gene expression in HCC
cells (data not shown).
Of wider implications may be the fact that Top2 inhibitors are
able to promote WT1 gene expression in normal human
hepatocytes. According to our current and previous findings,
up-regulation of WT1 in liver cells promotes apoptosis resistance
and cellular dedifferentiation (9). In a transient fashion, such
response in a normal cell may have evolved as part of its natural
defenses toward noxious stimuli. However, sustained expression of
WT1 undoubtedly contributes to malignancy. The up-regulation
of WT1 by drugs that target Top2 as shown here may contribute
to understand the development of drug-induced secondary

malignancies observed in patients receiving Top2-based chemotherapy (49).
In summary, WT1 is overexpressed in a significant number of
liver tumors and in specific hepatoma cell lines. WT1 sustains a
genetic program, which favors oncogenesis and tumor progression,
and may be a novel determinant in the acquisition of resistance
toward Top2-targeting chemotherapeutics. WT1 is therefore a
potential target for anti-HCC therapies, including novel strategies
such as WT1 peptide cancer vaccines, which are showing
promising results in hematopoietic malignancies and other solid
tumors (50).
