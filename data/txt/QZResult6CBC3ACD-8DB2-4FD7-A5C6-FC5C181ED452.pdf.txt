Abstract
The abnormal vasculature of the tumor microenvironment supports progression and resistance to treatment.
Judicious application of antiangiogenic therapy may normalize the structure and function of the tumor
vasculature, promoting improved blood perfusion. However, direct clinical evidence is lacking for improvements
in blood perfusion after antiangiogenic therapy. In this study, we used MRI to assess tumor blood perfusion in
30 recurrent glioblastoma patients who were undergoing treatment with cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor. Tumor blood perfusion increased durably for more than 1 month in 7 of 30 patients, in whom
it was associated with longer survival. Together, our ﬁndings offer direct clinical evidence in support of the
hypothesis that vascular normalization can increase tumor perfusion and help improve patient survival.

Introduction
Bevacizumab, a VEGF-speciﬁc antibody, was conditionally
approved in 2009 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma, based on 2
phase II trials showing notable antitumor activity alone or in
combination with adjuvant chemotherapy (1, 2). However,
whether bevacizumab treatment leads to longer survival in
recurrent glioblastoma patients in a phase III trial is not
known, nor are the precise mechanisms of survival beneﬁt.
A recent preclinical study has shown that anti-VEGF therapy
reduces tumor blood perfusion and increases invasiveness in
glioblastoma, casting doubt on any survival beneﬁt (3). In
contrast, a number of preclinical studies have shown that
judicious application of anti-VEGF agents can transiently
"normalize" the abnormal tumor vessels, and this normalization can reduce vascular permeability, edema, and hypoxia as
well as improve the delivery and efﬁcacy of various therapies

(4–7). Indeed, a phase II trial showed that cediranib, a panVEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can normalize the
blood vessels of recurrent glioblastoma (8), and more crucially,
the extent of vascular normalization by day 1 correlated with
both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS;
ref. 9). Furthermore, serial magnetic resonance spectroscopy
showed that cediranib also had a direct metabolic effect on
recurrent glioblastoma in patients who survived longer (10).
Although the ﬁrst human evidence for vascular normalization in rectal carcinomas (11), increased vessel maturation and decreased interstitial ﬂuid pressure, was followed
by further evidence for normalization in recurrent glioblastomas by less permeable and more normal-sized vessels and
reduced edema (8), direct evidence for increased blood
perfusion in human tumors—a potential consequence of
vascular normalization—is not yet available. Glioblastomas
have inefﬁcient, irregular vessels that are leaky and dilated
with a haphazard pattern of interconnection, and their
baseline blood perfusion rate on average is lower than that
of the surrounding normal brain (5, 6). As depicted in Fig. 1,
antiangiogenic therapy might affect tumor vessels in 3
different ways: no effect at all; excessive destruction of blood
vessels and reduction in perfusion leading to increased
hypoxia, necrosis, and/or invasion; or after pruning of some
abnormal vessels the structure of remaining tumor vessels
might become closer to normal vessels, potentially resulting
in an increase in absolute blood perfusion (5). To this end,
we measured the changes in tumor blood perfusion during
the course of treatment with cediranib using advanced
MRI methods in 30 recurrent glioblastoma patients, and
show for the ﬁrst time that tumor blood perfusion indeed
increased in a subset of patients undergoing VEGF treatment and that these patients survived approximately 6
months longer than patients whose tumor blood perfusion
did not increase.

Materials and Methods
Patient population
We included 30 subjects with conﬁrmed recurrent glioblastoma in this prospective study of cediranib sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute (NCT00035656; ref. 12). The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed
consent was obtained from all patients. After study termination, 9 of the 30 patients received 1 subsequent cycle of salvage
chemotherapy, 8 patients received 2 cycles, 1 patient received
3 cycles, 2 patients had undisclosed information, and 1 patient
received stereotactic radiosurgery.
MRI
Our MRI protocol including (1H-MRS; ref. 10) spectroscopy
has previously been described (8–10). In addition, arterial spinlabeling (ASL) perfusion images (QUIPSS II; ref. 13) were
acquired with repetition time ¼ 2.0 s, echo time ¼ 12 ms,
resolution ¼ 3.44 mm/3.44 mm/5 mm, matrix-size ¼ 64/64,
6/180 slices/volumes, and inversion-times ¼ 700 ms/1,800 ms.
Metabolic concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline
(Cho), and normal-side creatine (norCre) were assessed to
derive ratios for NAA/Cho, NAA/norCre, and Cho/norCre and
normalized to healthy tissue (10).
Volumetrics, permeability maps, and perfusion analysis
Tumor regions of interest were drawn by an experienced
neuroradiologist on ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery
(FLAIR)- and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (8, 9).
The dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) data were processed to
create Ktrans maps (8), a measure of the permeability-surface
area product. Blood perfusion [cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)] and
blood volume were calculated using established models on the

www.aacrjournals.org

dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) data in nordicICE and
corrected for contrast-agent leakage (14). Also, to minimize T1shortening effects, the contrast-agent predose from DCE was
used to saturate leaky tissue from the blood–brain barrier
breakdown or resection. Patient-speciﬁc variations were
reduced by automatic arterial input function selection and
partial volume correction, and tumor DSC values were normalized to normal-appearing gray- and white-matter tissue
(14). Blood perfusion by ASL was derived in Matlab as previously described (13), including quantitative T1 mapping.
Statistical analysis
Changes in perfusion after therapy onset were assessed by
applying a highly conservative threshold in which changes in
the tumor-to-reference tissue perfusion ratios had to be higher
or lower than the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) of the variations
across patients (98%–107%; baseline set to 100%), derived from
the within-patient percentage perfusion changes between the
2 baseline time points. Also, a perfusion increase or decrease
had to be consistent for 2 or more consecutive time points
equal to 1 month of imaging or more. We used paired Wilcoxon
test, with Holm–Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons, to assess changes over time. Groups were compared
using Mann–Whitney tests, log-rank test, and Wald test in Cox
regression analysis of survival data. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
The median PFS and OS durations from time of enrollment
for the 30 patients were 111 days (95% CI; 71–140 days) and
220 days (168–285 days), respectively, with 23.3% alive and
progression free at 6 months (12). Figure 2A shows examples

(Fig. 2B) compared with perfusion in reference tissue (Fig. 2C).
Correspondingly, Supplementary Fig. S1A shows serial anatomic MRIs of a patient with decreased perfusion (Supplementary Fig. S1B) compared with perfusion in reference
tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Here, baseline alterations
and especially changes in blood perfusion were neither
subtle nor limited to regions of contrast enhancement.
Importantly, the changes occurred even when the conventional
imaging showed signs of tumor response, with decreasing
contrast enhancement and mass effect (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), decreasing peritumoral vasogenic edema (Supplementary Fig. S2B), and decreasing permeability (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Durable increase in tumor perfusion of at least 1 month
duration was seen in 7 patients (Supplementary Fig. S3A),
stable perfusion in 12 patients (Supplementary Fig. S3B), and
durable decrease in tumor perfusion in 11 patients (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Figure 3A shows the group means over time,
also showing that all groups tended to eventually exhibit
increased perfusion, or reverse and return to pretreatment
perfusion values, after 1 or 2 months of imaging (8). Compared
with pretreatment values, patients with an increase in
perfusion showed an average increase in perfusion of >5%
(day þ1), >10% (days þ28 and þ56), and >15% (day þ112).

Individual time courses for all patients are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. These perfusion metrics focus on capillarylevel (microvessel) blood perfusion, but similar, supporting
results are present for total (macrovessel) blood perfusion
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and using microvessel perfusion
groups in Supplementary Fig. S4B) and ASL (macrovessel
perfusion groups, Supplementary Fig. S5A; and microvessel
perfusion groups, Supplementary Fig. S5B). Test-retest (Supplementary Fig. S6A) and between-baseline (Supplementary
Fig. S6B) reproducibility analysis showed minimal variability of
the microvessel blood perfusion technique.
An increase in tumor perfusion was associated with prolonged PFS (Fig. 3B) and OS (Fig. 3C). Patients with increased
tumor blood perfusion had a median OS of 348 days, as
compared with those with decreased tumor blood perfusion
(213 days) and stable tumor perfusion (169 days; Mann–
Whitney, P < 0.01; Supplementary Table S1). Using Cox regression with time-dependent covariates, the effect of increased
blood perfusion remained a signiﬁcant predictor of PFS and OS
after adjusting for T1-weighted and FLAIR tumor volume
changes during treatment and salvage chemotherapy and
stereotactic radiosurgery after study termination (P < 0.05).
Potential prognostic factors for outcome (9), including
age, pretreatment T1-weighted tumor volume, extent of resection, neurologic performance, and mental status were not

corrected). Values at day 1 were set as 100%. B, Kaplan–Meier analysis for PFS. C, Kaplan–Meier analysis for OS. Patients with an increase in tumor
perfusion had prolonged PFS compared patients with stable perfusion, and prolonged OS compared with patients with stable and decreased perfusion
(Mann–Whitney; P < 0.01, Holm–Bonferroni corrected). Differences between PFS and OS may be attributed to the inherent uncertainty of the PFS estimate by
the Macdonald criteria—because anti-VEGF agents decrease vascular permeability resulting in decreased contrast in the absence of an antitumor effect (4).

Discussion
The advent of antiangiogenesis therapy has been a welcome
advance in cancer treatment, yet it has been associated with
some controversy. The initially proposed mechanism of beneﬁt, namely, starving the cancer by elimination or reduction of
tumor vasculature, does not seem to ﬁt with clinical observations, particularly the of lack of a clear dose–response relationship and the lack of beneﬁt in the absence of concomitant
cytotoxic therapy (5, 6, 8, 9). Theoretically, administration of
anti-VEGF should reduce the effect of chemotherapy by reducing the supply of drug via elimination of blood vessels. In
addition, the resulting hypoxia should reduce the effectiveness
of drugs (5, 6). Yet, no anti-VEGF trial in patients with metastatic disease has shown a decline in OS compared with
chemotherapy alone (6). One possible explanation for these
ﬁndings is vascular normalization, whereby anti-VEGF treat-

ments, when used in judicious doses, can normalize abnormal
vessel structures, potentially leading to increased blood perfusion. In fact, a number of preclinical studies have shown that
antiangiogenic agents can improve oxygenation and/or drug
delivery (6). However, human data on increased blood perfusion, oxygenation, or drug levels are lacking.
To this end, our data provide 3 key insights. First, vascular
changes in recurrent glioblastoma after antiangiogenic therapy, including increased perfusion, clearly occur and occur

statistically signiﬁcant in Cox regression that included perfusion changes. Tested against a vascular normalization index
(VNI)—reﬂecting decreases in permeability and microvessel
blood volume and increase in circulating collagen IV levels—an
early predictor of PFS and OS after 1 day of antiangiogenic
treatment (9), patients with an increase in microvessel perfusion showed signiﬁcantly higher VNI values (0.48  0.24
mean  SEM) compared with patients with stable (0.44 
0.13) or decreased perfusion (0.51  0.26; Mann–Whitney;
P < 0.05; Fig. 4). Furthermore, for patients with increased
perfusion and compared with pretreatment ratios, tumor
metabolic ratios of NAA/norCre were signiﬁcantly higher at
days þ28 (1.89  0.28) and þ56 (1.38  0.51) and at day þ28
(1.52  0.37) for Cho/norCre (Wilcoxon signed-rank; P < 0.05;

VNI value is also associated with increased PFS and OS (9). Although
perfusion and blood volume are inherently associated, but not identical,
the relationship between perfusion changes and VNI indicate that
increased perfusion could be a result of decreased vascular permeability.

durably. Importantly, perfusion does not increase in all
patients, only in about 25% of them. Second, vascular changes
occur not only in regions most traditionally associated with
recurrent glioblastoma—that is, in the area of blood–brain
barrier breakdown—but also in surrounding areas. Third, and
most provocative, this increase in blood perfusion is associated
with prolonged survival.
The most straightforward explanation for these observations is that the increased tumor blood perfusion is simply a
result of decreased permeability of normalized blood vessels—
as the patient group with increased tumor blood perfusion had
the highest VNI. This is consistent with a mathematical model
showing that high vascular permeability can lead to perfusion
stasis, and conversely, that a decrease in permeability can
increase perfusion (15), and another model showing that the
decreased permeability also leads to a reduction in edema (16).
We have previously shown in preclinical data that edema
reduction alone by cediranib can account for increased survival without affecting tumor growth (4). However, edema
control alone does not fully explain the improved survival—
as we also observed direct metabolic effects of cediranib in
recurrent glioblastomas in some of the longer-surviving
patients (10). There are 2 potential explanations for this
metabolic response.
First, because cediranib is a multireceptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor and some of these receptors are present on glioblastoma cells (8), it is conceivable that the normalized vessels
permit a better delivery of cediranib to the glioblastoma cells,
leading to a better antitumor effect. Killing of cancer cells
surrounding blood vessels can open up compressed blood
vessels, and in turn, also increase blood perfusion (17). Thus,
cediranib acts as a combined vascular normalizing agent and
anticancer agent both contributing to increased tumor blood
perfusion. Consequently, the patients with increased blood
perfusion—and a higher VNI—beneﬁt from both better antiedema and anticancer effects. This could potentially explain
why some patients with decreased blood perfusion had no OS
gain—despite decreased vascular permeability and edema—
suggesting a lack of anticancer effect by cediranib in these
patients.
A second explanation might be that vascular remodeling and
resulting increased perfusion and delivery improve the innate
immune response (18, 19), an emerging and compelling con-

cept. A recent study offers evidence that targeting abnormal
polarization of tumor-associated macrophages can normalize
tumor vessels and also enhance antitumor immunity (19). Also,
a more even distribution of blood perfusion with a subsequent
reduction in areas of hypoxia and acidosis (6) can further
increase immune response as hypoxia and also low pH compromise the cytotoxic functions of tumor-inﬁltrating immune
cells (20). Thus, patients whose tumor blood perfusion did not
increase did not beneﬁt from immunostimulation resulting
from reduced hypoxia.
In summary, our data are consistent with the vascular
normalization hypothesis and suggest that improvement in
survival in response to anti-VEGF therapy may be mediated by
mechanisms other than vascular pruning and tumor "starvation." Whether bevacizumab has similar effects in glioblastoma
remains to be determined and is a high-priority research
question for the ﬁeld.

Correction: Increased Survival of Glioblastoma
Patients Who Respond to Antiangiogenic
Therapy with Elevated Blood Perfusion

In this article (Cancer Res 2012;72:402–7), which was published in the January 15,
2012, issue of Cancer Research (1), all instances of the word "ﬂow" in the Supplementary Figures should have been "perfusion." The corrected Supplementary
Figures for this article are available online at http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org.
The authors regret this error.
