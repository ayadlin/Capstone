Abstract
Mutation at the R132 residue of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), frequently found in gliomas and acute
myelogenous leukemia, creates a neoenzyme that produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from α-ketoglutarate
(α-KG). We sought to therapeutically exploit this neoreaction in mutant IDH1 cells that require α-KG derived
from glutamine. Glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminase and further metabolized to α-KG.
Therefore, we inhibited glutaminase with siRNA or the small molecule inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) and found slowed growth of glioblastoma cells expressing mutant
IDH1 compared with those expressing wild-type IDH1. Growth suppression of mutant IDH1 cells by BPTES
was rescued by adding exogenous α-KG. BPTES inhibited glutaminase activity, lowered glutamate and α-KG
levels, and increased glycolytic intermediates while leaving total 2-HG levels unaffected. The ability to selectively slow growth in cells with IDH1 mutations by inhibiting glutaminase suggests a unique reprogramming
of intermediary metabolism and a potential therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 70(22); 8981–7. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Despite the availability of oxygen, cancer cells exhibit high
glycolytic rates and increased lactate production, known as
the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis, rather than high oxidative phosphorylation. Over the past decade, oncogenes
(MYC, PI3K, RAS, and AKT) and tumor suppressors (VHL
and p53) have been documented to reprogram cancer cell
metabolism to aerobic glycolysis (1, 2). Cancer cells also consume glutamine for energy or as a carbon skeleton or nitrogen donor (3, 4). Recently, the oncogene MYC was found to
induce mitochondrial biogenesis and increase glutamine
metabolism, indicating that MYC stimulates both aerobic
glycolysis and glutamine oxidation (5).
Before the discovery of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
(IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) mutations, succinate dehydrogenase
and fumarate hydratase mutations, which cause hypoxiainducible factor 1, alpha subunit stabilization and hereditary cancer syndromes, were the only known oncogenic

mutations of metabolic enzymes. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur frequently in malignant low-grade gliomas, secondary glioblastomas, and acute myelogenous leukemias
(AML; refs. 2, 6–8). These discoveries underscore the
importance of metabolic alterations in oncogenesis and
suggest the possibility of targeting genetically altered
cancer metabolism.
Although wild-type (WT) IDH1 converts isocitrate and
NADP+ to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and NADPH, mutated
amino acids in IDH1 and IDH2 reside in the catalytic pocket
and result in a neoenzymatic activity: α-KG + NADPH → D-2hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) + NADP+ (9). IDH1 mutations in gliomas and AML have, thus far, only been found at residue
R132, which is most commonly mutated to a histidine (7).
Mutations of IDH2 have been found at both R140 and R172
(10). All documented IDH1 or IDH2 mutations result in the
ability to produce 2-HG from α-KG (9, 10).
Although the role of IDH1 mutation in tumorigenesis has
not been determined, changes in enzymatic function that
result from IDH1 mutation likely contribute to tumor formation. Decreased NADPH production from loss of IDH1 WT
function coupled with increased 2-HG levels could lead to
oxidative stress (11, 12). Secondly, 2-HG interferes with the
electron transport chain and could alter mitochondrial physiology and drive cells toward aerobic glycolysis (13). Due
to structural similarity between 2-HG and α-KG, 2-HG could
also interfere with the function of enzymes that utilize α-KG
(e.g., histone demethylases). Lastly, 2-HG is produced in
inborn errors of metabolism (L-2- or D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria) where the enzyme that metabolizes 2-HG (L- or D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase) is nonfunctional (14, 15). Individuals
with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria have been documented to

develop gliomas (16), but not those with D-2-hydroxyglutaratic
aciduria (the enantiomer produced by mutant IDH1/2).
It is not clear if blocking IDH1 mutant activity would be an
effective therapy, particularly if the mutant protein is only
involved in tumor initiation. However, because mutant
IDH1 tumors require α-KG to produce 2-HG, they could consequently be susceptible to alteration of α-KG homeostasis.
It has been shown that 2-HG is primarily derived from glutamine (Fig. 1; ref. 9). Glutamine is hydrolyzed by glutaminase
to produce glutamate that is subsequently converted to
α-KG. α-KG is then converted to 2-HG by mutant IDH1.
Thus, we sought to determine whether inhibiting glutaminase might perturb α-KG homeostasis and yield a selective
response in cancer cells bearing IDH1 mutant enzymes.

Materials and Methods
Standard techniques were used to introduce the R132H
mutation into human IDH1 engineered with a 6X-His-tag
and produce lentivirus containing either WT or mutant
IDH1. D54 cells or transformed normal human astrocytes
(TNA) were transduced with virus, and lines were grown

from individual cells using limiting dilution. IDH1 expression
in response to 0.04 μg/mL doxycycline was confirmed using a
6X-His tag antibody (Millipore). Liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry was conducted as previously described
(9). siRNA was used to knock down glutaminase, and cells
were assessed for knockdown using Western blotting (5).
Cell growth assays using alamarBlue were carried out as
described following DMSO or bis-2-(5- phenylacetamido1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) treatment (17).
Glutaminase activity was measured after treatment with
DMSO or BPTES by incubating cell extracts with [3H]-glutamine. [3H]-glutamate was isolated from the reaction mixture
using anion exchange and measured using a scintillation
counter. All effects of BPTES were assayed 48 hours after
treatment. Data were evaluated using a two-tailed Student's
t-test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Detailed materials
and methods are available as Supplementary Information.

Metabolic Inhibition of Cells with Mutant IDH1

to derive cell lines from patients with an IDH1 mutation have
been unsuccessful. Therefore, we created tet-inducible, stable D54 glioblastoma cell lines that overexpress WT or
R132H IDH1 (Fig. 2A). Expression of R132H IDH1 decreased
total IDH activity by 50% and 25% compared with cells
overexpressing WT IDH1 and parental D54 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). This observation corroborates
decreased IDH activity in cell culture models and glioblastoma tumor sections (7, 11, 18). 2-HG levels were elevated in
mutant IDH1 cells compared with WT IDH1–expressing
cells, whereas α-KG levels were not significantly different
(Fig. 2B and C).
Because previous studies had shown that α-KG consumed
by mutant IDH1 was derived from glutamine (Fig. 1; ref. 9),
we targeted glutaminase with siRNA to determine if mutant
IDH1 cells exhibited decreased growth compared with WT
IDH1 cells. siRNA against glutaminase specifically slowed
the growth of mutant IDH1 cells but not parental cells or
cells overexpressing WT IDH1 (Fig. 3A). Consistent with
the effects of anti-glutaminase siRNA, BPTES, a glutaminase
inhibitor (19), preferentially slowed growth of mutant IDH1
cells without inducing apoptosis (Fig. 3B, Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3). We also treated TNA, which overexpressed
R132H or WT IDH1, with BPTES and found that mutant
IDH1 cells were also more sensitive to BPTES (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We then sought to restore α-KG levels in BPTES-treated
cells to determine whether this would ameloriate growth
inhibition. Exposing cells to dimethyl-α-ketoglutarate, a
cell permeable α-KG precursor, significantly reduced
growth inhibition of mutant IDH1 cells by BPTES (Fig.

3B, Supplementary Fig. S2). These observations suggest
that glutaminase inhibition in mutant IDH1 cells decreased
α-KG levels, potentially altering intermediary metabolism
and consequently inhibiting cell proliferation. The effects
of BPTES at higher concentrations, however, were not
blocked by 1 mmol/L dimethyl-α-ketoglutarate. Although
the reasons for this are unclear, it is possible that 1
mmol/L dimethyl-α-ketoglutarate is not sufficient to rescue the effects of 50 or 100 μmol/L BPTES, or BPTES
may have additional growth inhibitory effects at elevated
concentrations.
Glutaminase activity was significantly reduced in both WT
and mutant IDH1 expressing cells (59% and 68% inhibition,
respectively) by 10 μmol/L BPTES (Fig. 4A). Consistent with
decreased glutaminase activity, BPTES treatment diminished
glutamate and α-KG levels. Lowered α-KG led to decreases in
subsequent tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (succinate
and malate), as well as aspartate, which is derived from
transamination of oxaloacetate with glutamate serving as
the nitrogen donor. Surprisingly, 2-HG levels remained unchanged in treated mutant IDH1 cells (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S5). However, levels of glycolytic intermediates
(fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxy-acetone-phosphate,
and 3-phosphoglycerate) increased with BPTES treatment,
indicating that glycolytic flux is altered. Intriguingly, citrate
levels changed in diametrically opposite directions between
WT and IDH1 mutant cells before and after BPTES treatment. Basal citrate levels were lower but increased in treated mutant IDH1 cells as compared with higher basal levels
in WT IDH1 cells that decreased with BPTES treatment
(Fig. 4C).

To further show the sensitivity of mutant IDH1 cells to
inhibition of α-KG synthesis, we inhibited enzymes that
convert glutamate to α-KG. Mutant IDH1 cells were more
sensitive to both epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a glutamate dehydrogenase inhibitor, and amino-oxyacetic acid
(AOA), a pan-transaminase inhibitor. However, a reduced

glucose concentration in the media was required to see
the effects of EGCG and AOA, suggesting that reduced glycolytic compensation is necessary to unmask the sensitivity
of mutant IDH1 cells to these inhibitors (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Mutant IDH1 cells were not more sensitive to glutamine deprivation than WT cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Metabolic Inhibition of Cells with Mutant IDH1

Nonetheless, acquisition of mutant IDH1 activity seems
sufficient to sensitize cells to inhibition of α-KG synthesis.

Discussion
Therapies that target various aspects of cancer cell metabolism are currently being developed and primarily focused on
glucose metabolism (2). The dependence of cancer cells on
glutamine for various processes is well documented (2–4)
and has also been a target of interest for therapy; however,
clinical trials have yielded little success due to a lack of efficacy or undesirable side effects of glutamine analogs (2, 4).
Here, we explored an inhibitor of glutamine metabolism,
BPTES, which allosterically inhibits glutaminase (but not glutaminase 2) and is not a glutamine analog (19). Specifically,
we studied the dependency of cancer cells with IDH1 muta-

tion on glutaminase activity for maintenance of α-KG
homeostasis.
The discovery of IDH1 mutations (6) identified a
metabolic genetic alteration present in a large fraction of gliomas and cytogenetically normal AML (6, 8). Genetically, a
clustering of heterozygous mutations in IDH1 at a single residue indicates a gain-of-function mutation that is supported
by the gain of a new enzymatic activity by mutant IDH1.
Rather than converting isocitrate to α-KG, mutant IDH1
consumes α-KG and produces 2-HG. Studies have shown
that glutamine serves as a cellular source of α-KG consumed
by mutant IDH1 (9). It is not currently understood whether
inhibiting mutant IDH1 and reducing 2-HG production
would be therapeutically useful, because a role for mutant
IDH1 or 2-HG in tumor maintenance has not been established. Thus, we sought to slow mutant IDH1 cell growth
by inhibiting glutaminase.

Figure 4. Metabolic changes result from overexpression of mutant IDH1 and 48 hours of treatment with 10 μmol/L BPTES. Glutaminase activity (A)
and glutamate, α-KG, and 2-HG levels (B) were measured in WT and mutant IDH1 cells. C, levels of other metabolites measured using LC/MS in response to
BPTES treatment. *, P ≤ 0.05 for B and C. The P value is for either D54 WT IDH1 DMSO versus 10 μmol/L BPTES or D54 R132H IDH1 DMSO versus
10 μmol/L BPTES.

Here we show that BPTES inhibits glutaminase activity
and consequently lowers glutamate and α-KG levels in mutant and WT IDH1 cells, but only growth of mutant IDH1
cells is preferentially slowed in response to BPTES treatment.
Intriguingly, BPTES treatment was associated with elevated
glycolytic intermediates, which may reflect a compensatory
increase in glycolysis to produce α-KG and maintain homeostasis. The notion that glutaminase inhibition perturbs α-KG
homeostasis and causes growth inhibition is supported by
rescue experiments using a membrane permeable α-KG
precursor. Further, inhibition of enzymes that convert glutamate to α-KG showed selectivity for mutant IDH1 cells but
only under glucose-deprived conditions. Mutant IDH1 cells,
however, were not more susceptible than WT IDH1 cells to
glutamine deprivation, and withdrawing glutamine altogether will eventually slow the growth of any cell that requires
glutamine as an essential nutrient. This result raises the possibility that inhibition of glutaminase may have a different
therapeutic result on IDH1 mutant cells compared with
inhibition of glutamine uptake.
Our metabolomic studies revealed a number of interesting
findings. First, although BPTES treatment lowered glutamate
and α-KG levels, 2-HG levels were not significantly decreased. Accordingly, if 2-HG competes with α-KG for binding sites on α-KG–dependent enzymes occupancy of these
sites with α-KG would fall with BPTES treatment. Although
the effect would likely not be significant in wild-type cells,
where α-KG presumably fills most sites, it could contribute
to impaired cell growth upon BPTES treatment of cells expressing mutant IDH1. Second, BPTES treatment decreased
subsequent tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, succinate
and malate. Additionally, levels of glycolytic intermediates
were increased, showing that metabolism is perturbed even
far from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We hypothesize that glycolytic intermediates are increased because of increased glycolytic flux to compensate for lowered α-KG levels; however,
we have not ruled out the possibility that intermediates build
up due to decreased glycolytic flux. One intriguing observation is the diametrically opposite changes in citrate levels between treated WT and R132H IDH1 cells. Currently, the
reasons for these differences are not fully understood, and
the dissection of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of
this article. Nonetheless, differences in intermediary metabolism between WT and mutant IDH1 cells are sufficient to
provoke a gain of sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition in cells
with mutant IDH1.
Although reduction of glutaminase activity is significant in
mutant IDH1 cells, the effects of BPTES on growth are
modest (about 20% growth reduction). The modest growth
reduction is not particularly surprising, because D54 cells
have a genetic background that can tolerate significant

siRNA-mediated reduction of glutaminase level. However,
the simple overexpression of mutant IDH1 alters intermediary
metabolism sufficiently to sensitize mutant IDH1 cells to glutaminase inhibition. We speculate that glioma cells with a
naturally occurring IDH1 mutation would show increased
susceptibility to glutaminase inhibition; however, no such cell
lines exist at present.
Additionally, cellular metabolism is incredibly dynamic
and seems to compensate for changes in intermediary metabolism, such as increased glycolysis, upon BPTES treatment. As a result, we propose that glutaminase inhibition
will not be effective as a single-arm therapy but will be a part
of a more complex strategy that may involve simultaneous
inhibition of glycolysis.
Like all treatments, there could be potential disadvantages
to this therapeutic strategy because glioblastoma cells engineered with mutant IDH1 or IDH2 could have a pseudohypoxic phenotype (18). Previous studies documented that
exogenous α-KG could reactivate prolyl hydroxylase, decrease hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit levels, and
inhibit cell growth resulting from pseudohypoxia elicited by
mutations in succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase (20). As such, reducing α-KG by glutaminase inhibition
could hypothetically enhance pseudohypoxia and favor tumor growth.
Our study shows that glutaminase could be a potential
therapeutic target in mutant IDH1 cancer cells. However,
further work is needed to investigate the metabolic consequences and biochemical specificity for mutant IDH1 cells
in response to glutaminase inhibition. An understanding of
these effects will be useful in developing combination therapies to augment the effects of glutaminase inhibition and
provide insights into how IDH1 mutation and 2-HG production affect cellular physiology.
