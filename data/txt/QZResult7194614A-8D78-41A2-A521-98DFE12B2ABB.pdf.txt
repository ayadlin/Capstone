Abstract
Cancer stem–like cells (CSC) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) have related properties associated with distant
metastasis, but the mechanisms through which CSCs promote metastasis are unclear. In this study, we report that
breast cancer cell lines with more stem-like properties display higher levels of microtentacles (McTN), a type of
tubulin-based protrusion of the plasma cell membrane that forms on detached or suspended cells and aid in cell
reattachment. We hypothesized that CSCs with large numbers of McTNs would more efﬁciently attach to distant
tissues, promoting metastatic efﬁciency. The naturally occurring stem-like subpopulation of the human
mammary epithelial (HMLE) cell line presents increased McTNs compared with its isogenic non–stem-like
subpopulation. This increase was supported by elevated a-tubulin detyrosination and vimentin protein levels and
organization. Increased McTNs in stem-like HMLEs promoted a faster initial reattachment of suspended cells
that was inhibited by the tubulin-directed drug, colchicine, conﬁrming a functional role for McTNs in stem cell
reattachment. Moreover, live-cell confocal microscopy showed that McTNs persist in breast stem cell mammospheres as ﬂexible, motile protrusions on the surface of the mammosphere. Although exposed to the environment,
they also function as extensions between adjacent cells along cell–cell junctions. We found that treatment with
the breast CSC-targeting compound curcumin rapidly extinguished McTN in breast CSC, preventing reattachment from suspension. Together, our results support a model in which breast CSCs with cytoskeletal alterations
that promote McTNs can mediate attachment and metastasis but might be targeted by curcumin as an
antimetastatic strategy. Cancer Res; 74(4); 1250–60. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Advances in primary breast cancer treatment have led to the
development of novel therapeutics; however, metastasis, the
main cause of cancer-related deaths, remains poorly understood and largely incurable (1). Traditional models of tumorigenesis suggest that malignancies develop in a series of stepwise genetic mutations culminating in the generation of cancer
cells able to disseminate and metastasize (2). However, recent
evidence strongly suggests that metastasis may be an early
event in tumorigenesis (3, 4). The cancer stem cell (CSC)
hypothesis offers new insights into tumorigenesis and metastatic progression that may lead to more effective therapies to

reduce metastasis. This hypothesis suggests that tumor development and metastasis are driven by a subpopulation of
tumor-initiating cells with the ability to form serially transplantable tumors in immunocompromised mice that recapitulate the characteristics and heterogeneity of the original
tumor (5). This subpopulation of cancer cells enriched in
tumor-initiating potential can be isolated from the tumor bulk
by surface markers or functional assays (6, 7). The stem cell
properties of self-renewal, multipotency, and chemotherapeutic resistance provide the driving force for tumorigenesis, and
would also provide a selective advantage during metastasis as
carcinoma cells survive the hostile environment of the circulation and proliferate in distal tissues (7, 8).
CSC markers are expressed on circulating breast cancer cells
obtained from the peripheral bloodstream of patients with
breast cancer (9, 10). CSCs may have additional traits such as
increased motility that prime them for successful metastasis
(3), supported by recent in vivo and patient studies where
metastasizing cells were found to display stem cell markers
(3, 8, 11–13). CSCs derived from human breast cancer cell lines
were shown to have increased metastatic potential in an
experimental metastasis model using nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (14). Using a PyMT
model of mammary tumorigenesis, early metastatic cells disseminated in the lungs displayed stem cell markers (3). In

Microtentacles in Breast Tumor Stem Cells

addition, immunostaining revealed disseminated tumor cells
in the bone marrow of patients with breast cancer express the
breast CSC phenotype (12).
Although the CSC theory has been adapted to encompass
primary tumor growth in epithelial cancers of many origins,
less has been uncovered about its implications for metastasis. Cytoskeletal changes are a critical component of the
metastatic cascade, as epithelial cells must undergo cytoskeletal alterations that allow them to intravasate into the
bloodstream, withstand the physical pressures of the shear
forces in circulation, and extravasate into distant tissues.
Cytoskeletal alterations are crucial to the process of metastatic dissemination, as carcinoma cells must alter their
morphology to move themselves from the site of origin and
migrate throughout the body. Interestingly, studies suggest
that circulating CSCs have a more deformable cytoskeleton
than more differentiated cells (15), but the speciﬁc cytoskeletal alterations in CSCs compared with normal tissue or
the tumor bulk remain unknown.
We have previously identiﬁed microtentacles (McTN), tubulin-based protrusions of the plasma membrane of mouse and
human mammary epithelial cells (MEC), as novel cellular
structures that form in response to extracellular matrix
detachment (16). McTNs are tubulin based, and mechanistically distinct from actin-based invadopodia and ﬁlopodia (16,
17). They promote the reattachment of suspended carcinoma
cells, a crucial step in metastasis by which circulating tumor
cells (CTC) exit the bloodstream (16, 18–20). Experimental
metastasis studies reveal that promotion of McTNs increases
lung retention of CTCs (17, 20). Interestingly, an in vivo study
using colon carcinoma cells demonstrated that attachment of
CTCs to the microvascular endothelium is dependent on
tubulin and enhanced by actin depolymerization (21), matching the mechanism underlying McTN formation.
Microtubules may be regulated by multiple posttranslational
modiﬁcations (22, 23). We have previously shown that detyrosinated a-tubulin is enriched in McTNs (16, 18, 24). Detyrosinated tubulin (Glu-tubulin) is formed by the removal of the
carboxy-terminal tyrosine on a-tubulin by a tubulin-speciﬁc
carboxypeptidase, exposing a glutamic acid residue (25).
This reaction is reversed by tubulin tyrosine ligase. Microtubules composed of Glu-tubulin have a vastly increased
stability in vivo, persisting for hours rather than the 3 to 5
minutes seen in microtubules composed of Tyr-tubulin (25).
Importantly, tubulin detyrosination in breast cancer predicts poor prognosis and metastasis (26, 27). Furthermore,
detyrosinated microtubules preferentially associate with the
intermediate ﬁlament vimentin (28), which can enhance
McTN formation (18). The tyrosination status of tubulin in
breast CSCs in unknown, but studies in neuroblastoma
suggest that detyrosinated tubulin may increase in less
differentiated, more stem-like cancer cells (29).
The CSC hypothesis suggests that by identifying the speciﬁc
subpopulation of cells responsible for tumorigenesis, we may
be able to identify or design more highly selective targeted
therapeutics. Curcumin, a dietary polyphenol found in the
spice turmeric, is generating signiﬁcant research interest
because of its antitumor properties. Curcumin has been stud-

ied as a chemopreventive agent in a variety of cancers (hematologic, breast, gastrointestinal, liver, prostate) and as an
inhibitor of metastasis (30). It was recently shown to selectively
inhibit the growth and self-renewal of breast tumor stem cells
via downregulation of Wnt signaling (31), but also has significant effects on the cytoskeleton.
Given the recent ﬁndings that CSCs may play a crucial role in
metastasis and CSCs may undergo cytoskeletal alterations, we
investigated the relationship between stemness and McTNs.
Flow cytometry was used to correlate the stem-like surface
marker phenotypes of a panel of breast cancer cell lines with
their McTN frequencies and metastatic potential. Flow
cytometry of a human MEC line with signiﬁcant and discrete
subpopulations of stem-like and non–stem-like cells was
used to investigate differences in McTNs, cytoskeletal alterations, and reattachment efﬁciency between stem-like
and non–stem-like subpopulations from an isogenic background. We speciﬁcally examined the protein levels and
organization of detyrosinated tubulin and vimentin, because
these cytoskeletal components play a role in McTN formation (16, 18). Furthermore, we explored whether the stemcell targeting agent curcumin could therapeutically inhibit
McTNs on CSCs. Our results identify that CSCs have elevated
McTNs that promote more efﬁcient reattachment and reveal
novel mechanisms to reduce metastasis by targeting these
cytoskeletal alterations.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemical compounds
Human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cells (32) were generously provided by Dr. J. Yang (University of California, San
Diego, CA) and grown in complete Mammary Epithelial Cell
Growth Medium (MEGM; Lonza) at 37 C in 5% CO2. SkBr3,
MDA-MB-468, BT-549, Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB436 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection,
which authenticates the cell lines by short-tandem repeat DNA
testing, were used within 6 months of resuscitation and grown
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and penicillin–
streptomycin (100 mg/mL; Gemini Bioproducts) at 37 C in 5%
CO2. Colchicine and curcumin were obtained from Sigma.
Staurosporine was obtained from EMD Millipore.
Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting
Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS by centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 5 minutes), and blocked (0.5% BSA/PBS) for
10 minutes. Cells were then incubated with the antibodies antiCD44 (Clone G44-26) and anti-CD24 (Clone ML5) from BD
Biosciences or isotype controls according to manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were sorted using BD FACSAria and analyzed using BD FACSDiva software.
Cell viability
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) was added
according to the manufacturer's recommendations to determine cell viability. Absorbance was measured using a Biotek
Synergy HT Multidetection Microplate Reader. All values are
shown as mean  SD of at least triplicate samples.

Western blotting
Sorted HMLE cells were allowed to readjust to culture conditions for 24 hours before cells were harvested as previously
described (18). Western blotting was performed using
NuPage gels (Life Technologies). Primary antibodies for CD44
(EPR1013Y; Abcam), vimentin (V9; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), detyrosinated tubulin (Abcam), a-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma), GAPDH (6C5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PARP
(Cell Signaling) were used at manufacturer's recommended
dilutions.
Immunoﬂuorescence
For suspended immunoﬂuorescence, sorted HMLE subpopulations were suspended for 30 minutes in growth media in
Ultra-Low Attachment plates (Corning). Cells were then gently
centrifuged onto poly-L-lysine–coated glass coverslips and
ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS (10 minutes). For attached
immunoﬂuorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips and
then ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS (10 minutes). Cells were
permeabilized (0.25% Triton X-100/PBS, 10 minutes), and
blocked for 1 hour [PBS/5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/
0.5% NP40]. Immunostaining was performed overnight at 4 C
(PBS/2.5% BSA/0.5% NP-40) using detyrosinated (Glu) tubulin
(Abcam) and vimentin (V9; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alexaconjugated anti-immunoglobulin G antibodies (Molecular
Probes) were used for secondary detection and Hoechst
33342 (Sigma) was used for nuclear staining. Images were
acquired using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal
microscope (Olympus). Images were taken with identical
microscope settings. Z-stacks were imaged as maximum intensity projections using ImageJ (NIH).
Live-cell imaging and McTN scoring
Cells were suspended in growth media without Phenol Red
over Ultra-Low Attachment plates (Corning) for 30 minutes.
Cells were either counted live (18) or ﬁxed (33) as previously
described. One hundred or more single cells per well were
scored blindly for McTNs by considering cells with two or more
McTNs extending greater than the radius of the cell body as
positive, with a minimum of 300 cells counted per condition
per trial. All values are shown as mean  SD of three independent experiments.
Mammosphere culture and imaging
HMLE and BT-549 cells were seeded at a concentration of
10,000 cells/mL in Complete Mammocult media (StemCell
Technologies) in Ultra-Low Attachment plates (Corning) and
grown according to manufacturer's directions. Mammospheres were infected for 24 hours with a custom GFP-membrane–targeted adenovirus (Ad-GFP-mem; Vector Biolabs),
generated from GFP-membrane–targeted AcGFP1-Mem plasmid (Clontech). Mammospheres were collected into DMEM
without Phenol Red containing CellMask Orange (1:5,000) and
incubated for 20 minutes in a glass bottom dish (MatTek
Corporation) then imaged on an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Three-dimensional surface rendering was done using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer). For
colchicine wash-in experiments, mammospheres were imaged

1252

and colchicine (50 mmol/L ﬁnal concentration) was added for
10 minutes for time-lapse confocal microscopy and images
were processed using ImageJ (1 frame/second).
Cell-electrode impedance attachment assay
Real-time monitoring of cellular reattachment from suspension was measured using an electrical impedance assay with an
xCELLigence RTCA SP real-time cell-sensing device (Roche
Applied Science). HMLE-sorted subpopulations (20,000 cells)
were seeded into E-plates containing growth medium, vehicle
[0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], or colchicine (50 mmol/L
ﬁnal concentration). BT-549 cells were pretreated for 6 hours
with vehicle or 50 mmol/L curcumin, then were added (20,000
cells) to E-plates containing vehicle or drug, respectively.
Impedance was measured every 3 minutes for 3 hours. The
attachment rate is expressed as the cell index, or the change in
electrical impedance at each time point, with values expressed
as the cell index  SD of triplicate wells. Three independent
trials were conducted.
Statistical methods
Signiﬁcance was determined by Student t test.

Results
McTNs correlate with CSC character in a panel of breast
cancer cell lines
We have previously demonstrated that McTNs are more
abundant in metastatic breast carcinoma cells lines (18), and
given the increasing evidence that CSCs sustain a metastatic
advantage (3, 8, 11–13), we investigated whether there was a
relationship between breast CSCs and McTNs. Using ﬂow
cytometry, the proportion of cells with a stem cell surface
marker phenotype (CD44hi/CD24lo) and non–stem cell surface
marker phenotype (CD44lo/CD24hi) were examined across a
panel of breast cancer cell lines for which we have already
characterized McTNs (18). This analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the proportion of stem-like subpopulations in a given breast cancer cell line, the relative abundance of McTNs in that cell line, and the cell line's metastatic
capabilities (refs. 34 and 35; Table 1).
Stem-like MECs have increased McTNs
To directly test the relationship between stem cell character
and McTNs, an immortalized, nontumorigenic human MEC
line, HMLE, was used, which contains distinctive and discrete
naturally present subpopulations of both stem-like and non–
stem-like cells (36). We prioritized analysis of the HMLE cell
line because of the even distribution and clear separation of
stem-like and non–stem-like fractions, which would allow
efﬁcient ﬂow sorting of these subpopulations. The isogenic
background of the HMLE cell line also provides a more reliable
system to ensure that differences in McTN frequency would
result from differences in intrinsic stem cell properties and
minimize the confounding factors that arise from transformation or genetic variability between different breast cancer cell
lines.
Blinded quantitation of McTNs from separated HMLE stemlike and non–stem-like subpopulations (Fig. 1A) was

subpopulations. Immunoﬂuorescence of attached HMLE subpopulations demonstrates that protein organization differs,
with prominent vimentin networks that colocalize with bundled, ﬁlamentous Glu-tubulin in the stem-like subpopulation,
whereas vimentin and Glu-tubulin in the non–stem-like
subpopulation are diffuse and non-ﬁlamentous (Fig. 2B). In
addition, immunoﬂuorescence performed on suspended subpopulations of HMLEs cells indicates McTNs in the stem-like
subpopulation are enriched in Glu-tubulin and vimentin (Fig.
2C, f and g), whereas the non–stem-like subpopulation lacks
both McTNs and a well-deﬁned network of Glu-tubulin and
vimentin (Fig. 2C, b and c).

performed while the cells were detached (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, there was over a 2-fold increase in McTN frequencies in
the stem-like compared with the non–stem-like subpopulation
(P  0.00005, n ¼ 3). The suspended cells from the stem-like
population exhibited long, ﬂexible McTNs (arrows), which are
absent on the non–stem-like cells (Fig. 1C).

Mammary stem-like cells have increased tubulindependent initial reattachment
Because previous studies have indicated that McTNs aid
tumor cell reattachment, we sought to determine if the
increased McTNs in the stem-cell subpopulation inﬂuence
attachment (16, 18–20, 24). We compared the ability of
the subpopulations to reattach from suspension by real-time

Stem-like MECs have McTN-promoting cytoskeletal
alterations
Given our previous ﬁndings that vimentin and detyrosinated
(Glu) tubulin can increase McTNs, we investigated whether
these cytoskeletal alterations may contribute to the observed
increase in McTNs in the stem-like subpopulation. Western
blot analysis revealed an increase in protein levels of vimentin
and Glu-tubulin in the stem-like compared with the non–stemlike HMLE subpopulation (Fig. 2A).
After conﬁrming an increase in vimentin expression and

electrical impedance. The stem-like cells exhibited signiﬁcantly faster initial reattachment (Fig. 3A). Phase-contrast imaging
shows that stem-like cells began to reattach and spread in as
early as 30 minutes (Fig. 3B) and nearly all were attached by
3 hours (Fig. 3B, h), whereas the non–stem-like cells
remained mainly in suspension by 3 hours, with only a few
cells beginning to reattach and spread (Fig. 3B, d). Furthermore, reattachment differences between the stem-like and
non–stem-like subpopulations are not because of toxicity, as
treatment with colchicine produced no difference in viability
between the subpopulations over the time period of attachment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine if the differences in initial reattachment were
because of the observed differences in McTNs, impedance
assays were performed on the sorted subpopulations with
vehicle or colchicine (50 mmol/L), a microtubule polymerization inhibitor that rapidly reduces McTNs (16). Colchicine
treatment reduced the initial reattachment in both the
stem-like and non–stem-like subpopulations (Fig. 3A), indicating that the observed reattachment was tubulin-based,
matching the mechanism of McTN formation and CTC adhesion to the capillary endothelium in vivo (16, 21). Although the
stem-like subpopulation formed signiﬁcantly more McTNs
than the non–stem-like subpopulation (Fig. 1B), the non–
stem-like subpopulation still produced tubulin-based McTNs,
albeit at a much lower frequency, and thus was also susceptible
to a further reduction in attachment efﬁciency when treated
with colchicine (Fig. 3A).
McTNs persist in mammospheres
As a novel cellular structure, the functional role of McTNs is
still being explored. We have shown that McTNs on suspended

breast cancer cells allow them to penetrate between endothelial cells, facilitating the initial steps in reattachment from
circulation (24). We have also shown that McTNs promote
cellular aggregation, where McTNs encircle adjacent cells
(16, 19, 33). Because McTNs promote short-term homotypic
aggregation of breast epithelial cells, we sought to determine
whether McTNs may play a similar role in the structure of
mammospheres arising during long-term growth. Mammosphere formation is a key functional assay for assessing stem
cell character, in which growth as nonadherent spheres
enriches for mammary stem-like cells (7). HMLE cells were
cultivated as mammospheres over 7 days, membrane-stained
with CellMask Orange, and gently pipetted into glass-bottomed dishes for live-cell confocal microscopy. Long, motile,
and dynamic protrusions from the cells were observed along
the edges of mammospheres (Fig. 4A, a, black arrows, and
Supplementary Movie S1A), which were abolished upon the
addition of colchicine (Fig. 4A, b, and Supplementary Movie
S1B), further demonstrating that the observed protrusions are
tubulin-based McTNs.
Having established that dynamic McTNs persisted on the
surface of cells in mammospheres, we further investigated if
McTNs also penetrated through the 3-dimensional structure of
mammospheres. Both HMLE and tumorigenic BT-549 cells
were cultivated as mammospheres, and transduced with GFP
targeted to the cell membrane to visualize McTNs from
individual cells. The entire mammosphere was subsequently
stained with CellMask Orange and transferred to a glassbottom dish for live-cell confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional computer rendering of these mammospheres reveals
that cells within mammospheres exhibit long, ﬂexible protrusions, which encircle adjacent cells within the mammosphere

and penetrate between cell–cell junctions in the mammosphere walls (Fig. 4B, white arrows, and Supplementary Movies
S2–S5). Although encirclement of adjacent cells with McTNs
contributes to short-term cell aggregation (33), this evidence
indicates that McTNs can persist between adjacent cells during
mammosphere development over many days.
Stem-cell targeting agent curcumin reduces McTNs and
reattachment
Having demonstrated that McTNs are increased in the stemlike subpopulation and persist in mammospheres, we sought
to determine if pharmacological targeting of breast CSCs might
also inhibit McTNs. We investigated whether curcumin, a
dietary polyphenol inhibitor of Wnt signaling shown to inhibit
breast CSCs (31) would have an effect on McTN levels and
function. Because the BT-549 breast cancer cell line has both a
high proportion of stem-cell character and high levels of
McTNs (Table 1) and has previously been shown to be responsive to short term, high-dose treatments of curcumin (37), we

www.aacrjournals.org

examined the effect of curcumin on CSC character, McTN
formation, and reattachment efﬁciency in BT-549 cells. Curcumin was previously shown to reduce stem cell signaling as
early as 12 hours (31), but can inhibit motility as quickly as 10
minutes when given in high doses (38). Given curcumin's wideranging yet rapid effects, we determined if curcumin could
affect the CSC subpopulation and McTNs after a relatively
short 6 hour treatment. First, we investigated any potential
toxicity from curcumin treatment that could potentially confound future studies. A cell viability assay determined that
there was no signiﬁcant loss of cell viability at 6 hours over a
dose range of curcumin (Fig. 5A). To further ensure that
curcumin treatment was not inducing apoptosis, cells were
assayed for PARP cleavage. Treatment with staurosporine (16
hours, 1 mmol/L) induced robust PARP cleavage as a positive
control, but treatment with a dose range of curcumin (6 hours)
revealed no cleaved PARP (Fig. 5B); these ﬁndings indicate that
curcumin's effects on CSC characteristics and McTNs are
independent of toxicity and apoptosis.

Because curcumin has been shown to be well-tolerated even
at very high doses in patients (30), the highest dose shown to be
nontoxic (50 mmol/L) was prioritized for functional studies.
Doses of 50 mmol/L curcumin have been shown to be nontoxic
in many cell lines, including MCF-7 (breast), LnCAP (prostate),
PC-3 (prostate), HepG2 (liver), and A-549 (lung; refs. 38 and 39).
After a 6-hour treatment, curcumin (50 mmol/L) dramatically
reduces the percentage of cells expressing the CD44hi/CD24lo
stem cell marker phenotype (Fig. 5C, P  0.005, n ¼ 3). Longterm mammosphere formation was also inhibited by curcumin
treatment, further conﬁrming that this dose of curcumin
inhibits the breast CSC subpopulation in our model (50
mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S2). Having established that 50
mmol/L of curcumin treatment for 6 hours was sufﬁcient to
affect breast CSCs, we sought to determine whether McTNs
were also affected. When BT-549 cells were treated with either
vehicle or curcumin (50 mmol/L, 6 hours; Fig. 5D), blinded
quantitation revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in McTN frequencies with curcumin treatment (2-fold, P  0.0005, n ¼ 3). To
test if this curcumin-induced decrease in McTNs impacted the

1256

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

reattachment of breast tumor cells, we compared the ability of
vehicle or curcumin-treated (50 mmol/L, 6 hours) BT-549s to
reattach from suspension by real-time electrical impedance.
Cells were pretreated with vehicle or curcumin for 6 hours and
reattachment was monitored in the presence of vehicle or
curcumin, respectively. Treatment with curcumin resulted in
a signiﬁcant reduction in reattachment efﬁciency compared
with vehicle (Fig. 5E).

Discussion
The cytoskeletal dynamics of CTCs are a crucial determinant
of their ability to survive the shear forces of the circulatory
system and reattach to distal sites for eventual metastatic
outgrowth. CSCs may have a more deformable cytoskeleton,
giving them a survival advantage in the bloodstream over more
differentiated cells (15), but it is uncertain which cytoskeletal
components are speciﬁcally altered in more stem-like cells. We
previously reported that MECs produce novel tubulin-based
protrusions of the plasma membrane termed McTNs upon

detachment and suspension (16). In a normal epithelial cell, the
outward expansion of microtubules is counteracted by the
inward-directed force of the actin cortex, a balance termed
the cellular tensegrity model (40). Cytoskeletal dysregulation in
tumor cells disrupts tensegrity, allowing for the formation of
McTNs in suspended breast cancer cells (19). These McTNs
facilitate reattachment, where McTNs penetrate endothelial
cell layers and promote retention in the lungs of living mice in
experimental metastasis assays (20, 24). Here, we report for the
ﬁrst time that breast cancer cell lines with high proportions of
cells expressing the breast CSC surface marker phenotype,
CD44hi/CD24lo, are associated with an elevated level of McTNs.
Although this correlation between the breast CSC phenotype
and McTNs was established using many cell lines (Table 1),
further analysis was prioritized using the isogenic HMLE

model system, which has clearly deﬁned CSC and non-CSC
subpopulations and the BT-549 cell line, which is highly
enriched in the CSC surface marker phenotype, has high levels
of McTNs, and has previously been reported to rapidly respond
to curcumin treatment (37).
Using the HMLE cell line as an isogenic model of naturally
arising stem-like and non–stem-like subpopulations, we further demonstrate that the stem-like subpopulation of MECs
have signiﬁcantly increased levels of McTNs and enhanced
reattachment. These data suggest that not only are breast CSCs
more efﬁcient at tumor formation, they are primed for more
successful metastasis by promoting McTN formation, which
facilitates attachment at distal sites.
McTNs may be stabilized through a variety of mechanisms,
including a-tubulin detyrosination and upregulation of the

intermediate ﬁlament vimentin (reviewed in ref. 19). Protein
analysis and immunoﬂuorescence of attached and suspended
HMLE stem-like and non–stem-like cells suggest that breast
CSCs promote McTN formation through tubulin detyrosination and vimentin upregulation. Both Glu-tubulin and vimentin enhance McTN formation and signify poor patient prognosis (26, 27, 41), but until this study had not been identiﬁed
as concordant cytoskeletal alterations speciﬁc to the breast
CSC subpopulation. Furthermore, our ﬁndings suggest that
increased tubulin detyrosination and vimentin expression
provide a selective advantage to breast CSCs during the
metastatic process, as they enhance McTN formation and can
promote reattachment. Our novel ﬁnding that stem-like breast
cells have a dramatically faster reattachment rate provides
compelling evidence that breast CSCs are inherently more
capable of metastatic dissemination. Tubulin has long been a
popular target for cancer therapeutics given its role in cell
division, yet widespread toxicity and acquired drug resistance
limits the utility of tubulin-targeted agents (42). Our data
demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the stem-like subpopulation
of breast cells are enriched in detyrosinated (Glu) tubulin and
vimentin, cytoskeletal modiﬁcations that support the increased McTN frequency observed in the breast stem-like subpopulations. This novel ﬁnding that breast stem cells have
elevated, stable microtubules that enhance McTN formation
suggests that the development of therapies aimed at this
speciﬁc subset of Glu-microtubules may be more efﬁcacious
in reducing metastasis and generally less toxic than therapies
affecting microtubules indiscriminately.
The growth of single cells under nonadherent conditions
into spheres termed mammospheres has become an important
assay for breast stem cell character, as mammosphere growth
depends on the presence of self-renewing stem cells (7). In this
study, we show that dynamic, tubulin-dependent McTNs persist on the outer surface of mammospheres after 7 days of
growth under nonadherent conditions. Our confocal imaging
data suggest that McTNs on these breast CSCs penetrate
between cell–cell junctions, encircling adjacent cells within
the mammosphere wall, extending the role of McTNs beyond
facilitation of short-term homotypic aggregation. Our previous
studies focused on the generation of McTNs on single, suspended cells; here, we show that cells growing attached to one
another in a mammosphere are still able to form McTNs on
areas of the cell membrane exposed to the environment. Given
our novel ﬁndings that McTN persist during long-term mammosphere growth and remain reactive to the environment of
suspension, it is possible that McTNs on circulating CSCs may
also aid in the formation and even reattachment of clusters of
CTCs. Characterization of CTCs is an emerging ﬁeld, where the
identiﬁcation and biological signiﬁcance of CTC clusters in the
bloodstream is poorly understood. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments using single cell suspensions of metastatic breast carcinoma cells reveal the formation of homotypic aggregates
at the site of attachment to the endothelial wall (43), and a
recently developed enrichment-free immunoﬂuorescence detection method has identiﬁed circulating aggregates of tumor
cells in bloodstream of patients with various epithelial cancers
(44). Regardless of whether the aggregates are formed during

1258

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

transit in the bloodstream or following the adhesion of an
initial single cell, McTNs could be facilitating this cluster
reattachment of breast carcinoma cells to the vascular endothelium. Similar to the McTNs we report here both within the
mammosphere wall and on the outer surface of the mammosphere, McTNs on circulating CTC clusters could both aid in
the aggregation of CTC clusters and in their attachment to the
endothelium.
Recently, Shibue and colleagues have identiﬁed a novel
cellular structure, termed ﬁlopodia-like protrusions (FLP),
with similarities to McTNs (45, 46). FLPs are actin-based
protrusions produced by attached breast cancer cells that
interact with the ECM via integrin b1 to aid in establishing
primary tumors and metastatic lesions. Importantly, when
using the same HMLE model for stem-like and non–stemlike as the present study, FLPs were more numerous and
longer lived in the stem-like subpopulation. Collectively,
these data suggest that breast CSCs have unique cytoskeletal
modiﬁcations that promote metastatic spread. Like McTNs,
FLPs are increased in more metastatic cell lines. In contrast,
McTNs are tubulin-based protrusions generated on suspended cells whereas FLPs are actin-based structures arising
on ECM-attached cells. Further distinguishing McTNs and
FLPs, activation of actin-severing protein coﬁlin enhances
McTN formation while impairing FLP formation (33, 46).
These differences in cytoskeletal structure underscore the
need for careful consideration of cytoskeletal-targeted chemotherapeutics, as the initial stages of CTC reattachment
depend on tubulin whereas transendothelial migration and
colonization rely on actin (17, 21).
Although there are many questions remaining about stem
cell biology and CSCs, the identiﬁcation of surface markers that
enrich for tumor-initiating cells has effectively demonstrated
that in many epithelial cancers, only a subset of cells are
capable of efﬁcient tumorigenesis and metastasis. The next
step toward clinical utility of the CSC theory is to identify
speciﬁc therapeutic targets to inhibit CSCs while sparing
normal epithelial cells. Our data reveal that a short-term
treatment with high doses of curcumin is sufﬁcient to reduce
the CSC surface marker phenotype without affecting viability.
For the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate that short-term, high-dose
curcumin treatment can inhibit McTN formation and prevent
reattachment from suspension. These data demonstrate that
stem-cell–targeted therapies can have rapid effects on the
surface markers and cytoskeletal organization of CSCs that
are independent of effects on growth and do not require longterm selection of different subpopulations. Because curcumin
is well-tolerated even at very high doses in patients (30), and
nontoxic in many cell lines (38, 39), it is also possible that the
side effects of curcumin treatment may be relatively low. Our
ﬁnding that curcumin inhibits McTNs and reattachment may
provide a mechanism for previous studies in which curcumin
treatment was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce breast cancer cell
adhesion in a parallel plate ﬂow chamber assay (47), where a
loss of McTNs could prevent the breast cancer cells from
making the initial attachments required for adhesion. In
addition, data showing that treatment with curcumin inhibits
spontaneous metastasis of human breast cancer to the lung in

a mouse xenograft model support our model in which inhibition of McTNs prevents cancer cell retention in the lungs,
serving as a potential strategy to reduce metastasis (48).
Curcumin has been shown to have pleiotropic mechanisms
of action (reviewed in ref. 30), exerting effects by directly
interacting with targets (at least 33 different proteins) or by
modulating gene expression through multiple transcriptional
factors, such as NF-kB and Wnt/b-catenin (30). We and others
have shown that curcumin inhibits the breast CSC subpopulation (31); however, in this study we report that McTNs are a
novel target for curcumin and can inhibit CSC reattachment.
Although the speciﬁc mechanism of action in McTN reduction
is under current investigation, it remains possible that curcumin is reducing McTNs and inhibiting reattachment through
numerous mechanisms, beyond its direct effects on the cytoskeleton. Fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET indicate that
curcumin may bind directly to tubulin, the major component
of McTNs (49, 50). Several studies in breast and prostate cancer
cell lines suggest that curcumin can interfere with microtubule
dynamics and F-actin architecture in a dose, time, and cellline–dependent manner (38, 49, 51, 52). Curcumin's speciﬁc
effects on cytoskeleton of breast CSCs compared with other
more well-differentiated normal and malignant epithelial cells
and its disruption of McTN formation are the subject of
ongoing investigation in our laboratory.
Although this study focuses on the cytoskeletal dynamics of
cultured human breast tumor cells subjected to free-ﬂoating
conditions, these conditions cannot completely recreate the
complexity of human disease. Previous studies in animal
models from our lab and others have shown that CTCs reattach
to blood vessel walls with an actin-independent, tubulindependent cytoskeletal mechanism (20, 21) that matches the
McTNs we have identiﬁed within the stem-like subpopulation
of cultured breast tumor cells. New methods for imaging
McTN-based reattachment of CTCs within intact blood vessels
are under development in our laboratory. To extend these
ﬁndings into patients with breast cancer will require new
technology to rapidly isolate live and intact CTCs for dynamic
cytoskeletal studies. Such rapid CTC isolation technology is
under intense development by many groups and will be used
when it is available to determine if circulating breast CSCs from

human patients produce McTNs that aid in their reattachment
at distal sites.
The data presented here support a model in which breast
CSCs are not only highly tumorigenic, but are primed for more
successful metastasis because of cytoskeletal alterations leading to increased production of dynamic McTNs, which promote reattachment. Curcumin's ability to reduce McTNs and
inhibit reattachment makes curcumin an intriguing potential
chemotherapeutic that could not only inhibit the outgrowth of
metastases but also reduce the potential for circulating CSCs to
reattach and establish deadly metastases.
