Abstract
Dendritic cells (DC) and cytokines that expand myeloid
progenitors are widely used to treat cancer. Here, we show
that CD11c+DEC205+ DCs coexpressing A-smooth muscle actin
and VE-cadherin home to perivascular areas in the ovarian
cancer microenvironment and are required for the maintenance of tumor vasculature. Consequently, depletion of DCs in
mice bearing established ovarian cancer by targeting different
specific markers significantly delays tumor growth and
enhances the effect of standard chemotherapies. Tumor
growth restriction was associated with vascular apoptosis
after DC ablation followed by necrosis, which triggered an
antitumor immunogenic boost. Our findings provide a
mechanistic rationale for selectively eliminating tumorassociated leukocytes to promote antitumor immunity while
impeding tumor vascularization and to develop more effective
DC vaccines based on a better understanding of the tumor
microenvironment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7684–91]

Introduction
Despite significant advances in our understanding of the tumor
cell cycle, the 5-year survival rate for ovarian carcinoma patients is
still lower than 40%. As ovarian cancer cells express immunogenic
determinants (1–4), immunotherapy offers great promise to
complement standard treatments. However, therapies that induce
protective immunity against melanoma have failed against ovarian
carcinoma (5) due to an incomplete understanding of its peculiar
microenvironment. Therefore, to develop effective immunotherapies against ovarian cancer, better knowledge of the immunosuppressive networks that operate in its atypical milieu is required.
Our previous work unveiled a mechanism whereby immature
dendritic cells (DCs) contribute to ovarian cancer progression by
acquiring a proangiogenic phenotype in response to vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; refs. 6–8). VE-cadherin+ DCs are
the most abundant leukocyte subset (>30% of total cells) in the
microenvironment of ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a mouse ovarian tumor (6)
as well as in human solid ovarian carcinoma samples but not in
human ascites (7). Unlike classic myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(9) in other epithelial tumors (10, 11), most CD11b+ leukocytes in

mouse ovarian cancer coexpress CD11c and DEC205, supporting
their DC lineage (6). Most importantly, although most ovarian
tumor–infiltrating DEC205+CD11c+ are negative for costimulatory
CD80 and exhibit low levels of MHC-II and CD86, their capacity to
efficiently present antigens can be exposed under inflammatory
conditions (6).
DCs are primarily viewed as orchestrators of peripheral
tolerance under steady-state conditions but inducers of immunity
during inflammation (12). Consequently, DCs are largely viewed as
being crucial for antitumor immune responses in the context of
cancer (13), and numerous DC-based vaccine trials have been
attempted as a novel intervention against many cancer types.
Moreover, cytokines are widely used to expand myeloid progenitors, including those that give rise to DCs, in cancer patients (14).
In contrast, emerging studies suggest that DCs can also function as
inducers of T-cell tolerance under certain inflammatory conditions
(11, 15–21).
Because of the abundance and immature phenotype of ovarian
cancer DCs, we hypothesized that these cells could represent
important contributors to tumor growth and therefore novel
therapeutic targets. Here, we show how the elimination of DCs
dramatically delayed ovarian cancer progression. These effects were
mediated by an antitumor immunogenic boost preceded by tumor
necrosis. Our findings provide a rationale for manipulation of critical
elements of the tumor microenvironment as antitumor therapy and
to develop more effective DC-based vaccines based on a better
understanding of their potential to support tumor development.

Materials and Methods
Animals, tissues, and treatments. Mice were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute or The Jackson Laboratory. Animal experiments
were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Stage
III to IV human ovarian carcinoma specimens were procured through
Research Pathology Services at Dartmouth under an approved protocol.
Single-cell suspensions were generated as we described (7).
We generated ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a flank or i.p. tumors as described (6).
Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula V = 0.5 (L  W 2), where L is
length and W is width. To generate ID8-luciferase, parental ID8 cells were
transduced thrice with pFB-neo-Luciferase retroviruses and selected with
0.8 mg/mL G418. For visualization of tumor burden, mice were injected
with 0.2 mL of 15 mg/mL luciferin (Promega). After 10 min, animals were
anaesthetized with isoflurane and imaged using the IVIS 200 system
(Xenogen Corp.). ID8-OVA cells were described (22).
The anti-DEC205 NLDC145 antibody, conjugated or not to ribosomeinactivating saporin, was provided by Celldex Therapeutics. Treatments
started 1 d after tumor challenge.
To generate chimeric mice, we lethally irradiated congenic (CD45.1) mice
(two doses of 500 rads, 24 h apart). Four hours later, 2  106 cells from

the bone marrow of healthy (CD45.2) ITGAX-diphtheria toxin receptor
(DTR)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) were i.v. injected. After confirming
that >95% of circulating cells were of donor origin, mice were i.p. challenged
with 2  106 ID8-luciferase tumor cells 8 wk after reconstitution.
Treatments (150 ng of i.p. DT every 3 d, or PBS) started 3 d later.
Generation of the anti-CD11c immunotoxin. The heavy- and lightchain variable region cDNA (VH and VL) of hamster anti-mouse CD11c
antibody were cloned from N418 hybridoma (American Type Culture
Collection; ref. 23) using the following degenerated primers: VH.Forward,
5¶-CAGATCCAGTTGGTGCAGTCTGG-3¶; VH.Reverse, 5¶-CGAGGAGACTGT-

GACTGAGGT-3¶; VL.Forward, 5¶-GACATCAAGATGACCCAGTC-3¶; and
VL.Reverse, 5¶-CCGTTTCAGTTCCAGCTTGGTCCC-3¶. The VH and VL were
assembled with a (Gly4Ser)3 encoding linker to yield a full long single-chain
fragment encoding the whole antibody variable region. The COOH-terminal
end of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) was fused to the hinge
sequence of human CD8 followed by the sequence encoding for truncated
Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38; ATCC). This fusion gene was then subcloned
into a pET-28a(+) plasmid (Novagen) for expression in Escherichia coli
BL21 (DE3; Invitrogen). To produce immunotoxin (IT), recombinant bacteria
were harvested 15 h after induction of recombinant protein expression with
1 mmol/L isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside. Optimum conditions of
denaturation, refolding, and dialysis from inclusion bodies have been
published (24). We obtained a final amount of f1 mg of IT after purification
using a thiophilic resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Clontech). To generate a control compound, PE38 was subcloned into a
pET-28a(+) plasmid without the scFv sequence, in frame with the His-tag,
expressed in E. coli BL21, and purified using a standard Ni column.
Enzyme-linked immunospot. Peptides were from New England Peptide.
Flat-bottomed, 96-well nitrocellulose-lined plates (Millipore) were coated
with IFN-g monoclonal antibody (mAb; AN-18; eBioscience) and incubated
overnight at 4jC. After washing with coating buffer (eBioscience), plates
were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 2 h at 37jC. Effector
and target cells were incubated together for 20 h in 10% FBS RPMI 1640.
After incubation, the plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and
biotinylated secondary IFN-g mAb (R4-6A2; eBioscience) was added. After
incubation for 2 h at 37jC, the plates were washed and developed with
avidin-horseradish peroxidase (eBioscience) for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing, fresh substrate (3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole, Sigma) was
added and the plates were incubated for f20 min.
Histology, flow cytometry, and Bio-Plex. Biotinylated tomato lectin
(150 Ag in 150 AL of PBS; Vector) was injected through the left ventricle
and allowed to circulate. The vasculature was then perfused with 1%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 min. Cryosections of OCT-embedded tumors
(8 Am thick) were immunostained as described (6). Biotinylated lectin was
detected by rhodamine-streptavidin (Leinco) or Alexa Fluor 350 (Molecular
Probes). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was enhanced with a rabbit
anti-GFP Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Molecular Probes).
Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences).
(CD45+ DEC205+ VE-cadherin+ ) DCs were sorted from mechanically
dissociated human ovarian carcinoma specimens using a FACSAria sorter
(BD Biosciences).

An allophycocyanin-labeled tetramer consisting of Kb folded with
GQKMNAQAI peptide was provided by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility
(Atlanta, GA).
Anti-mouse antibodies were specific for CD31 (MEC13.3), CD45 (30-F11),
CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD25 (PC61), CD69 (H1.2F3), and CD11c (HL3;

eBioscience); FoxP3 (staining buffer set; eBioscience); and anti-actin and asmooth muscle-Cy3 (1A4; Sigma). Anti-human antibodies were specific for
CD45 (HI30), DEC205 (MG38), CD3 (UCHT1), CD4 (OKT4), CD8 (RPA-T8),
CD31 (M89D3), CD11b (ICRF44), and CD14 (M5E2), all from BD Biosciences.
Human VEGF-A, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGFb), and interleukin8 (IL-8) and mouse Vegf-a, FGFb, and CXCL1 were detected using a
Human-27-Plex or a Mouse-9-Plex panel cytokine assays, respectively
(Bio-Rad), with supernatants from human CD45+DEC205+ leukocytes
sorted from dispersed ovarian carcinoma samples, or with mouse
CD11c+DEC205+ cells sorted from tumor ascites, following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results
Elimination of CD11c+ DCs decreases ovarian cancer
growth. To investigate the contribution of CD11c+ DCs to
ovarian tumor progression, we used CD11c-DTR-GFP transgenic
mice (ITGAX-DTR-GFP). In this strain, CD11c+ DCs express the
receptor of DT as well as traceable green fluorescence and can be
transiently depleted (>92%) by DT administration, whereas DT
administration has no effect on CD11c+ cells in wild-type (WT)
mice (25, 26). WT or ITGAX-DTR-GFP mice (n = 6 per group;

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

two independent experiments) were treated with either i.p. DT or
PBS and immediately challenged with s.c. ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a
cells, an aggressive epithelial ovarian cancer line (6). As we have
previously reported, these tumors are heavily infiltrated by
DEC205+CD11c+MHC-IIlow DCs (6, 8). Supporting the DC lineage
of their human counterpart, most DEC205+ leukocytes infiltrating
unselected human solid primary (n = 3) or metastatic (n = 5) ovarian
carcinoma specimens were CD11b , whereas expression of CD14,
although more variable, was found on a minority of DEC205+ cells in
most specimens analyzed (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). In
contrast, and in agreement with previous reports (27), we found that
most leukocytes in tumor ascites (n = 3) were monocyte/
macrophage cells (CD14+/CD11b+), underscoring the importance
of microenvironmental factors (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Most importantly, the temporary ablation of mouse CD11c+ DCs
at the time of tumor injection resulted in 3-fold lower tumor size
after 2 months (441.4 F 59 mm3 versus 146.81 F 33.4 mm3; P < 0.05,
Wilcoxon test; Fig. 2A). Reduced tumor growth was not caused by an
unknown antitumor effect of DT because tumor growth was not
affected in WT littermates (Fig. 2B).
To determine the involvement of DCs in the progression of
established tumors, we performed a temporary depletion of
CD11c+ cells in mice bearing 10-day-old flank ovarian tumors
(n = 10 per group). This resulted in a 3-fold reduction in tumor size
for 5 additional weeks of growth (713.2 F 65.1 mm3 versus 254.1 F
137 mm3; P = 0.03, Wilcoxon test; Fig. 2C). Thus, CD11c+ cells were
also involved in the growth of established tumors.

Dendritic Cells Contribute to Ovarian Cancer

Elimination of CD11c+ DCs results in tumor necrosis and
increased survival. Histologic analyses after DT administration
showed substantial necrosis in central areas of the tumor,
compared with mice receiving PBS, and confirmed the elimination
of CD11c+ (GFP+) cells from viable tumor locations (Fig. 2D).
Tumor necrosis became obvious after f36 h of treatment and
reached a maximum at 48 h (Fig. 3A). As antitumor T cells require
longer than 36 h to become reactivated (28), it is unlikely that these
initial anticancer effects were caused by an adaptive immune
response. Because of the role of CD11c+ cells in ovarian cancer
vascularization (6, 7), we hypothesized that impeded tumor
vascularization accounted for the reduction in tumor growth.
Correspondingly, preceding tumor cell death (24 h after DT
administration), we found expression of active caspase-3 (indicative of apoptosis) on f40% of (CD31+) blood vessels in all tumors
examined, whereas tumor samples from control mice only showed
scattered caspase-3 staining on CD31 cells (Fig. 3B). Together,
these data indicate that CD11c+ DCs acquire a proangiogenic
phenotype in the tumor microenvironment that is important for
the maintenance of tumor vasculature and therefore the progression of ovarian cancer.
However, although the ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a cell line induces
aggressive tumors that mimic the physiopathology of human
ovarian cancer (6), it is maximally engineered to attract immature
DCs. To establish the therapeutic potential of constantly depleting
CD11c+ DCs in hosts bearing orthopic (i.p.) ovarian tumors that do

not ectopically express Defb29 and Vegf-a, we reconstituted lethally
irradiated congenic (CD45.1+) mice with bone marrow from
(CD45.2+) ITGAX-DTR-GFP animals, which allows multiple injections of DT without compromising survival (26). Eight weeks
after reconstitution, >95% of blood leukocytes were of donor origin
in all mice (data not shown). Animals (n = 6 per group; two
independent experiments) were then challenged with parental ID8
cells, expressing luciferase for intravital monitoring of tumor
progression. In treated mice, DCs were then depleted every 4 days
with i.p. DT, whereas control animals were injected with PBS.
Depletion of CD11c+ cells resulted in a reduction of tumor burden
(Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S2A) and induced a significant
increase in survival (P < 0.01, log-rank test; Fig. 3D).
A novel anti-CD11c IT eliminates tumor-infiltrating DCs in
nontransgenic hosts. To define the therapeutic potential of
depleting DCs in nontransgenic tumor-bearing hosts, we generated
an anti-CD11c IT by cloning the variable regions of the anti-mouse
CD11c N418 hybridoma, fused to a Pseudomonas exotoxin A
lacking the cell-binding domain (29, 30). The IT was expressed and
purified, along with the control truncated toxin lacking the singlechain antibody, which is harmless because it cannot get
internalized.
Incubation of CD11c+ DCs sorted from tumor ascites with
15 ng/mL of IT resulted in the death of f70% of cells within 40 h.
Interestingly, the same dose of IT caused the death of only f30% of
bone marrow–derived DCs (Supplementary Fig. S2B), whereas the

of CD11c+ cells with 4 weekly i.v. administrations of

7 mg/kg topotecan at day 7 plus 0.33 mg/kg/d IT for
2 wk (IT +Top ); and the same regimen of topotecan
(day 7) plus IT (daily from day 3) administered until
mice developed ascites [IT+Top(b) ]. C, i.p. ovarian
carcinoma–bearing mice (n = 6 per group), depleted of
CD11b+ leukocytes by 4 weekly i.p. administrations of

mice receiving the same dose of unconjugated saporin
(both from Advanced Targeting Systems). D, i.p.
ovarian carcinoma–bearing mice (n = 6 per group),
depleted of DEC205+ DCs by i.p. administrations of
anti-DEC205-saporin IT (DEC205SAP ; 0.25 mg/kg;
Celldex Therapeutics), survived longer than animals
receiving the same amount of unconjugated antibody
(DEC205), which in turn exhibited an increase in life
span compared with animals injected with PBS.

i.v. administration of 20 Ag of IT (n = 3) eliminated <40% of splenic
CD11c+ cells after the same period (Supplementary Fig. S2C). To
test the effects of our IT in tumor-bearing hosts, we collected
ascites from mice with ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumors (n = 5), which
contained f30% of CD11c+ cells. Tumor ascites cells were
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled
and i.p. injected (2  106 cells per mouse) into healthy C57BL/6
animals (n = 5 per group). After 5 h, mice received an i.p. injection
of IT (0.33 mg/kg body weight) or PBS (control). Two days later,
CD11c+CFSE+ cells were found in peritoneal samples, but not in
any other locations, in both groups, although the total was 5-fold
lower in mice treated with the anti-CD11c IT compared with
control animals (Supplementary Fig. S2D ). In contrast,
CD11c CFSE+ cells were not decreased. Importantly, comparable
proportions of CD11c+CFSE DCs were found in spleen and
draining (mediastinal) lymph node samples from both groups.
These data indicate that the anti-CD11c IT can predominantly
deplete peritoneal ovarian cancer–infiltrating DCs with little effect
on DCs from lymphatic compartments that may potentially elicit
antitumor immunity.
Depletion of CD11c+ DCs delays tumor progression and
enhances the effect of standard chemotherapies. Weekly i.v.
injections of anti-CD11c IT induced a dramatic decrease in
the growth of established ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a flank ovarian tumors
(n = 5 per group) when treatment started at day 7 (6-fold; 109.8.0 F
65.1 mm3), or as late as day 21 (3.5-fold; 184.60 F 75.1 mm3),
compared with mice treated with a truncated toxin (646.1 F
163.2 mm3; P < 0.001 for both, Wilcoxon test; Fig. 4A, left). As
observed in transgenic mice, the depletion of CD11c+ DCs induced
central necrosis within 48 h (Fig. 4A, right).
As a model for aggressive human ovarian carcinoma, we i.p.
injected ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a cells into WT mice (n z 6 mice per
group; refs. 6, 31). Mice with established tumors received the
chemotherapeutic drug topotecan along with various doses of the
anti-CD11c IT or truncated control. Topotecan or IT treatment
alone induced a similar and significant 20% increase in the median
life span (P < 0.05, log-rank test; Fig. 4B). No weight loss or animal
death was detected throughout the treatments. Furthermore, the
combination of topotecan and a daily treatment with IT for
2 weeks resulted in a further 18% increase in survival (P < 0.05).
Importantly, a continuous administration of IT following the
administration of topotecan extended life span by 53% compared
with individual treatments (P < 0.01). Corresponding results were
observed at lower doses of IT (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Even in the absence of antitumor adaptive immunity, i.v.
administration of anti-CD11c IT also impaired the growth of
human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells implanted in the flank
of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (2,267 F
398 mm3 versus 832 F 250 mm3; n = 5 per group; P = 0.03,
Wilcoxon test; Supplementary Fig. S2F). Although these effects can
be only attributable to the impairment of tumor vasculature,
central necrosis after DC depletion was observed, although less
dramatic than in ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2G).
Suggesting the potential of using multiple targeting strategies,
the beneficial effect of DC depletion was confirmed by administering an anti-CD11b saporin-based IT, which also induced
a significant increase in survival compared with saporin alone
(P < 0.01; Fig. 4C).
Depletion of DEC205+ DCs induces comparable antitumor
effects. To confirm that the impairment of tumor progression is

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

only attributable to the elimination of the predominant
CD11c+DEC205+ DC population, we used a different IT consisting
of the DEC205-specific NLDC145 antibody, conjugated to ribosome-inactivating saporin. Although DEC205 is expressed on other
cells, this antibody primarily targets CD11c+MHC-II+ DCs in vivo
(32). We confirmed that the i.p. administration of 0.25 mg/kg
body weight of anti-DEC205-saporin resulted in the elimination of
>50% of splenic DCs, but not other leukocyte subsets, in healthy
mice (Supplementary Fig. S2H).9 The same dose of anti-DEC205saporin every 4 days in mice bearing i.p. ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a ovarian
cancer resulted in a >30% increase in the median life span
compared with mice injected with PBS (P < 0.01, log-rank
test; Fig. 4D). In addition, control mice treated with the same
regimen of unconjugated anti-DEC205 antibody also exhibited a
significant (P < 0.05, log-rank test) increase in survival compared
with mice receiving PBS, although it was lower than that induced
by anti-DEC205-saporin (P < 0.05, log-rank test; Fig. 4D). Together,
these data confirm that the elimination of DCs and not other
leukocytes from tumor-bearing hosts accounts for the antitumor
effects.
Elimination of tumor DCs induces a boost in specific
antitumor immunity. Although at the latest stage of cancer
progression virtually all T lymphocytes in tumor ascites were not
activated (CD69 ) in either group, up to 40% of cytotoxic T cells
from animals depleted of DEC205+ DCs were antigen experienced
(CD44+) compared with 4% in control mice (Fig. 5A). We surmised
that the release of tumor antigens induced by the elimination of
most DCs and the subsequent tumor disruption may enhance,
rather than impair, the endogenous antitumor immune response.
To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 WT mice (n = 4) were challenged
with ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumors, and after 5 days of tumor
progression, mice were depleted of DCs every 2 days with i.p.
injections of anti-CD11c IT (0.2 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. One month
after tumor challenge, before the occurrence of massive ascites, the
elimination of DCs resulted in an increase in the proportion of
activated (CD69+) CD8 T cells in peritoneal wash samples. Most
importantly, the peritoneal cavity of mice depleted of CD11c+ DCs
contained a f6-fold higher proportion of cytotoxic T cells
specifically recognizing an H-2Db–restricted mesothelin epitope
expressed by ID8 tumor cells, ranging from 2% to 5% of CD8 T cells
(Fig. 5B; ref. 33).
To confirm the antigen specificity of the immunogenic boost
against a different antigen, we challenged CD8+ transgenic
ovalbumin (OVA)-specific (OT-I) mice with OVA-expressing ID8
cells admixed with tumor ascites and injected them with IT or the
truncated toxin 1 day later. As expected, the spleens of mice
depleted of DCs exhibited a much higher frequency of T cells
producing IFN-g in response to OVA (Fig. 5C) and irradiated tumor
cells (Fig. 5D) in enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis
compared with spleens from control mice. Together, these data
confirm that the elimination of CD11c+DEC205+ DCs from the
tumor microenvironment, likely followed by the possible generation of new waves of DCs to a less suppressive milieu, dramatically
enhanced, rather than abrogated, the specific antitumor immune
response.

ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumor ascites cells (containing 30% CD45+CD11+VE-cadherin+ DCs) and received 0.5 mg/kg of IT or truncated toxin (Ctrl ) 1 d later. After 7 d,
mice received again 107 ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumor ascites cells i.p. followed by a new DC depletion or control treatment at day 8. Splenocytes were collected
at day 11 and stimulated for 7 d with OVA (1 Ag/mL; Sigma). IFN-g ELISPOT was performed against bone marrow–derived DCs pulsed with OVA (1 Ag/mL; 10:1,
splenocyte to DC ratio). D, depletion of CD11c+ DCs in OT-I transgenic mice also enhanced the amount of IFN-g–producing splenocytes responding to DCs
pulsed for 4 h with g-irradiated and UV-irradiated OVA-ID8 tumor cells (10:1, DC to ID8 ratio).

the elimination of CD11c+ DCs supports our previous finding that
tumor-infiltrating DCs are important for tumor vascularization
(6). Confirming the massive recruitment of DCs by ovarian
tumors, 85% of CD11c+ cells banding in the viable interface after
density gradient centrifugation of mechanically dissociated
ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a solid tumors coexpressed DEC205 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To further characterize their role in tumor blood
vessel formation, we perfused the vasculature of flank tumorbearing ITGAX-DTR-GFP mice (n = 6 per group) by intracardiac
injection of biotinylated tomato lectin. All specimens contained
structures assembled by GFP+ (CD11c+) cells, which primarily
clustered around the tumor periphery, suggesting a permanent
recruitment of these cells to the area of growth. Although these
also represent areas of active angiogenesis, most peripheral
CD11c+ structures were not perfused by lectin (Fig. 6A, left, and B, left)
left) nor contained erythrocytes (data not shown), indicating that
they are assembled before being permeated by blood. In contrast,
in central areas of the tumor, >50% of perfusible blood vessels
were surrounded by irregularly scattered GFP+ (CD11c+) leukocytes (Fig. 6A, right). Although GFP fluorescence colocalized with
intravascular lectin in selected structures inside the tumor
(Fig. 6B, middle), most GFP+ cells in central areas were
distributed in a pericyte-like pattern (near endothelial cells but
in outer layers) or a perivascular pattern (near the vessel wall but
not in contact with vessels; Fig. 6B, right). Surprisingly, virtually all
CD45+CD11c+DEC205+ leukocytes in dispersed solid tumors or
tumor ascites expressed a-smooth muscle actin (SMA; Fig. 6D;
Supplementary Fig. S3B and C) and NG2 (Supplementary
Fig. S3D, left) but not platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(Supplementary Fig. S3D, right). As reported (6, 7), most DCs also
coexpressed VE-cadherin, which was confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3B) and further supported by the presence of
numerous tumor-infiltrating MHC-II+GFP+ leukocytes in mice
transferred with transgenic VE-cadherin-GFP bone marrow cells

www.aacrjournals.org

(Supplementary Fig. S3E). More importantly, CD45+CD11c+ DCs
sorted from mouse tumor ascites secreted Vegf-a and CXCL1,
whereas CD45+DEC205+ cells procured from dispersed stage III to
IV human ovarian carcinoma specimens, but not CD4+ lymphocytes, secreted FGFb, VEGF-A, and high levels of CXCL8 (Fig. 6E).
These factors are known to induce the recruitment and promote
the survival of sprouted endothelial cells (34).

Discussion
Here, we show that the depletion of DCs in mice bearing ovarian
tumors with four different methods that target one of three DC
markers (CD11c, DEC205, or CD11b) significantly delayed cancer
progression. DC depletion activates multiple antitumor mechanisms. On the one hand, it causes vascular apoptosis followed by
tumor necrosis, supporting the concept of a critical contribution of
DCs to ovarian cancer vascularization (6). On the other hand,
transient elimination of DCs paradoxically boosted the antitumor
immune response, likely because the early disruption of tumor tissue
makes available massive amounts of tumor antigens to undepleted
or newly generated DCs. Therefore, our findings provide a
mechanistic foundation to enable more effective biological therapy
for cancer patients targeting tumor-associated leukocytes and other
critical elements of the tumor microenvironment to complement the
standard ‘‘surgical debulking/chemotherapy’’ approach.
DCs are primarily viewed as professional antigen-presenting
cells specialized in the stimulation of naive T lymphocytes. Because
our system only allows the depletion of most but not all DC
subsets, and only in a temporary manner, our results do not
challenge this dogma. Because at least 85% of CD11c+ cells in the
solid tumor microenvironment coexpresses DEC205, these effects
should be attributed to the elimination of DCs and not other nonDC leukocytes. It is likely that by ‘‘resetting the system,’’ newly
generated DCs at lymphatic locations engulf these antigens and
present them to naive T cells in a less tolerogenic milieu.

Ovarian tumor cell death takes place more rapidly after DC
depletion than with standard antiangiogenic strategies based on
VEGF signaling neutralization and is preceded by vascular cell
apoptosis, suggesting that tumor-infiltrating DCs are important
for maintaining tumor blood vessels. The crucial role of different
leukocyte subsets on neoangiogenesis has been previously
recognized (35–37). In ovarian cancer, CD11c+ cells home to the
wall of most blood vessels within the tumor, where they express
SMA and NG2 and secrete VEGF-A, FGF, and IL-8, which are
critical factors for the recruitment and support of sprouted
endothelial cells. CD11c+ cells also assembled unperfused structures and express VE-cadherin in areas of active angiogenesis,
suggesting that they could be also important for initiating nascent

tumor vessels. Although tumor-infiltrating DCs acquire endothelial-like and pericyte-like attributes in different tumor areas, we
cannot claim with our current data that they turn into bona fide
endothelial cells or canonical pericytes, as they retain leukocyte
markers. Our results rather point to an alternative ‘‘scaffold’’ model,
whereby CD11c+ phagocytes (8) generate tubular structures in the
extracellular matrix, which are permeated by blood due to the leaky
nature of tumor vasculature. Sprouted endothelial cells brought by
the blood flow would then line these channels, displacing
leukocytes to outer layers as the vessel matures. DCs could
therefore provide paracrine as well as direct structural support for
the survival, stabilization, and branching of new blood vessels, thus
becoming crucial players in ovarian cancer vascularization.

human ovarian carcinoma suspensions. CD45+CD11c+ DCs (mCD11c+ ) were sorted from the ascites of ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumor-bearing mice. Cells (106/AL)
were stimulated for 4 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (50 ng/1 Ag/mL). Cytokines were determined by Bio-Plex analysis.

Dendritic Cells Contribute to Ovarian Cancer

In summary, our results show how the elimination of
proangiogenic DCs by targeting different DC-specific markers
impairs ovarian cancer progression. Our findings provide a
rationale for the design of more effective cancer interventions
that incorporate the targeting of critical contributors to cancer
progression different from tumor cells.
