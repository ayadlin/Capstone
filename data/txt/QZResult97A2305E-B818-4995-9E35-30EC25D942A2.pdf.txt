Abstract

Author Manuscript

Most chemotherapeutical drugs kill cancer cells chiefly by inducing DNA damage, which
unfortunately also causes undesirable injuries to normal tissues, mainly due to p53 activation. We
report a novel strategy of normal tissue-protection that involves p53/NF-κB coordinated metabolic
regulation. Pretreatment of untransformed cells with low doses of arsenic induced concerted p53
suppression and NF-κB activation, which elicited a marked induction of glycolysis. Significantly,
this metabolic shift provided cells effective protection against cytotoxic chemotherapy, coupling
the metabolic pathway to cellular resistance. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we
demonstrated an absolute requirement of functional p53 in arsenic-mediated protection.
Consistently, a brief arsenic-pretreatment selectively protected only normal tissues but not tumors
from toxicity of chemotherapy. An indispensable role of glycolysis in protecting normal tissues
was demonstrated by using an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose, which almost totally
abolished low-dose arsenic-mediated protection. Together, our work demonstrates that low-dose
arsenic renders normal cells and tissues resistance to chemotherapy-induced toxicity by inducting
glycolysis.

anticancer therapy is mainly mediated by p53 (1). Recent studies using mouse models
indicate that a temporary suppression of p53 activity can significantly reduce DNA damageinduced cytotoxicity without compromising the tumor suppression function (2, 3), raising a
probability of brief p53 inhibition for cancer therapy protection.

Author Manuscript

The transcription factor NF-κB regulates various genes important for the immune response,
cell proliferation, and cell survival (4, 5). During the immune response, cells consume large
amounts of glucose and primarily use aerobic glycolysis to produce enough energy to meet
the bioenergetics demands of cellular proliferation and survival (6). In addition to its
involvement in the immune response, the NF-κB pathway has also been shown to be
activated by irradiation-induced DNA damage, but the functional consequences of this
response were shown to be multifaceted, as NF-κB was capable of functioning either as a
pro-survival or pro-death signal (7). Dynamic crosstalk has been demonstrated between the
p53 and NF-κB pathways. Although this crosstalk is highly context dependent and has been
shown to function either as antagonistic or cooperative between the two pathways, p53 and
NF-κB are considered to overall function against one another to maintain cellular
homeostasis (8).
By expanding our recent study indicating that low-dose arsenic can suppress
chemotherapeutic drug 5FU-induced p53 activation (9), we exploited the use of arsenic for
protection of normal tissues against chemotherapy-associated damages. We show that lowdose arsenic protects sensitive tissues by inducing reciprocal p53 suppression and NF-κB
activation, and subsequent metabolic shift. Using colon carcinoma xenograft mouse models,
we demonstrate that a brief pretreatment with low-dose arsenic protected selectively normal
tissues, but not tumor cells, from 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) induced killing.

Results
A mutually exclusive interaction between p53 and NF-κ B in low-dose arsenic-induced
protection

Author Manuscript

When human fibroblasts were treated with 5FU, a distinct response of p53 and NF-κB was
observed. In contrast with p53, which was robustly induced in response to DNA damage
(supplemental Fig. 1A), little NF-κB activity was detected in 5FU-treated human fibroblasts,
as reflected by a chiefly cytoplasmic p65 distribution (supplemental Fig. 1B). The lack of
NF-κB activity in 5FU-treated cells was not due to any defect of this pathway since there
was a clear induction of p65 nuclear distribution by TNFα, a known NF-κB activator
(supplemental Fig. 1B). This distinct response of p53 and NF-κB led us to test the effect of
low-dose arsenic, which we previously showed can inhibit 5FU-induced p53 activation (9).
When compared with the control, pretreatment of human fibroblasts with 50 nM arsenic for
12 h resulted in marked suppression of both p53 activation and γH2AX induction by 5FU
(Fig. 1A. 5FU versus As+5FU), consistent with what was observed with epithelial cells (9).
Interestingly, parallel to this impaired p53 response was NF-κB activation, as indicated by
an overt p65 nuclear distribution in arsenic-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Significantly, low dose
arsenic-pretreatment was also associated with considerable NF-κB activation in 5FU-treated
cells (Fig. 1B). To tie the response of p53 and NF-κB with cellular sensitivity to 5FU, we
examined cell survival by performing an apoptotic assay. Consistent with the significantly

diminished γH2AX and p53 induction in arsenic-treated cells, the 5FU-induced apoptosis
was considerably reduced (Fig. 1C). Collectively, the data demonstrated an inverse
correlation of p53 and NF-κB with cell survival, where p53, but not NF-κB, activation was
linked to 5FU-induced cell death while, conversely, low-dose arsenic-induced protection
was associated with concerted suppression of p53 and stimulation of NF-κB.
A requirement of functional p53 in low-dose arsenic-induced protection

Author Manuscript

We further investigated this seemingly opposite response of NF-κB and p53 to arsenic by
asking whether suppression of p53 function is necessary for NF-κB activity. Cells were pretreated with a low dose of Nutlin-3a, a p53 specific activator. Interestingly, under the
condition of mild p53 activation, low-dose arsenic-induced p65 nuclear distribution was
completely blocked (Fig. 2A, As versus Nutlin 3a+As), suggesting that p53 inhibition is
necessary to allow NF-κB activation. Correlated with the NF-κB activity was cellular
sensitivity. In Nutlin 3a-treated cells, arsenic was unable to induce protection. The levels of
5FU-induced γH2AX were comparable in the presence or absence of arsenic (Fig. 2B). We
further tested the p53 requirement by depleting the p53 expression with siRNA. Indeed,
down-regulation of p53 nearly eliminated the difference of cellular sensitivity to 5FU
between arsenic-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2C). We also used a mutant p53-expressing
mouse model to validate the in vitro findings. In contrast to wild-type p53 mice where
arsenic prevented 5FU-induced body weight loss, p53 mutant mice showed little response to
arsenic (supplemental Fig. 2). Together, the results indicate that functional p53 is essential
for low-dose arsenic-induced protection.
Low-dose arsenic-induced protection is mediated by a metabolic change

Growing evidence indicates that both p53 and NF-κB are involved in regulation of cellular
metabolism, where p53 promotes oxidative phosphorylation whereas NF-κB stimulates
aerobic glycolysis(10). We tested the possibility that arsenic-induced p53 suppression
coupled with NF-κB stimulation may affect cellular metabolism by favoring glycolysis.
Indeed, when compared to control cells, an equal number of low-dose arsenic-treated cells
exhibited a clear increase of lactate production (Fig. 3A), which was blocked by the addition
of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of glycolysis, supporting a glycolytic metabolism.
To substantiate this observation, we determined the level of glucose transporters 1 and 3
since the expression of glucose transporters are critical to glycolysis (4, 11).
Immunostaining revealed that the levels of GLUT-1 & 3 were indeed considerably induced
by arsenic treatment (Fig. 3B). A close temporal correlation with arsenic-induced p65
nuclear localization and GLUT-3 induction suggested a NF-κB mediated regulation
(supplemental Fig. 3). Apart from GLUT-3, NF-κB was reported to induce HIF1α (5).
Interestingly, arsenic induced not only a clear increase of the protein abundance but also
nuclear distribution of HIF1α (Fig. 3C). Treatment with Capsaicin, an NF-κB pathway
inhibitor, blocked this effect of low-dose arsenic, consistent with NF-κB-dependent
regulation (Fig. 3C).
We also used Nutlin-3a and capsaicin to demonstrate that p53 inhibition and NF-κB
stimulation were critical for the induction of GLUT-3 by arsenic (Fig. 3D & E). The effect
of capsaicin was further verified by depleting p65 expression with siRNA (supplemental

Fig. 4). Together, our data indicate a functional interaction between p53 and NF-κB in
regulation of cell metabolism. By inhibiting p53 activity and permitting NF-κB to function,
low-dose arsenic induces glycolysis.

Author Manuscript

We went on to test whether the observed increase in glycolytic metabolism contributes to
the arsenic-induced resistance to 5FU. Two independent approaches, limiting glucose supply
or 2-DG, were used to inhibit glycolysis. Low glucose cultures completely lost arsenicinduced protection as evidenced by a comparable level of apoptosis induction by 5FU in
lymphocytes with or without pretreatment of arsenic (Fig. 4A). The requirement of
glycolysis was further supported by the use of 2-DG, which nearly completely abrogated
arsenic-induced protection (Fig. 4A). The crucial role of glycolysis in arsenic-mediated
protection was also evident when γH2AX induction was analyzed in fibroblasts (Fig. 4B–
D). We further substantiated the data derived from 2-DG by using RNAi by knocking down
the expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an enzyme essential for glycolysis. A result
almost identical to that of 2-DG was observed (Fig. 4E), supporting a requirement of
glycolysis in arsenic-mediated protection. An important role of the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP) was also tested by depletion of the expression of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of PPP. The arsenic-mediated protection
was abrogated in G6PD-deficient cells (Fig. 4F). The immunostaining data in fibroblasts
were further validated by the colony formation survival assay (Fig. 4G), supporting a critical
role of the glycolytic and PPP pathways in arsenic-induced protection. Collectively, our data
support a model in which low-dose arsenic induces a coordinated p53 inhibition and NF-κB
stimulation, which upregulated the expression of HIF1α and GLUT-3, leading to a
metabolic shift to glycolysis, and it is the glycolytic and PPP pathways that render cells
increased resistance to 5FU toxicity.

Author Manuscript

To test the physiological relevance of low-dose arsenic-induced cellular resistance, we
extended our study to mice. Immunohistochemistry of the small intestine, a tissue very
sensitive to 5FU, indicated an overt increase of the GLUT-3 protein abundance in the
arsenic and arsenic plus 5FU, but not the control or 5FU alone treated mice (Figure 5A),
consistent with the in vitro data. To complement the analysis of GLUT expression, we
performed live animal imaging to monitor the uptake of labeled 2-DG. Strikingly, a clear
increase of glucose uptake was evident in low-dose arsenic-treated mice. The glucose uptake
in the arsenic plus 5FU-treated mice was also considerably increased, albeit slightly lower
than that in mice treated with arsenic only (Figure 5B). Inspection of the small intestine
crypts morphology revealed a close correlation of glycolysis and protection (Figure 5C). The
importance of glycolysis was further supported by a pre-treatment of mice with 2-DG
(200mg/kg body weight), which blocked arsenic-mediated protection (Figures 5C).

Low dose arsenic selectively protects normal tissues without affecting the antitumor
efficacy of 5FU
We next exploited the distinct p53 status that separates normal tissues from most cancer
cells to assess the potential of low-dose arsenic in selectively protecting normal tissues from
5FU-induced injury. For this purpose, we used a colon carcinoma cell line SW-480 to
generate a mouse xenograft model. Treatments were initiated when the tumor reached an

average volume approximately 100 mm3. The mice were pretreated with or without 0.4
mg/kg sodium arsenite for three days before subjected to 5FU treatment. The tumor volume
in the vehicle group continued increase with time (Fig. 6A). Low-dose arsenic treatment did
not have any detectable effect on tumor growth (Fig. 6A). 5FU treatment (30mg/kg body
weight i.v.) daily for one week resulted in marked tumor inhibition (Fig. 6A). Significantly,
low-dose arsenic pretreatment showed little effect on 5FU-induced tumor suppression, as
5FU-induced tumor regression is indistinguishable in mice that were pretreated with or
without low-dose arsenic (Fig. 6A). There was little difference between male and female
mice in response to the treatment of 5FU and arsenic (Fig. 6A). Our data thus indicate that a
brief pretreatment with low-dose arsenic does not detectably affect the efficacy of 5FU, at
least in the human colon carcinoma xenograft mouse model.

Author Manuscript

To examine whether low-dose arsenic could alleviate 5FU-induced toxicity in these tumorbearing mice, we monitored body weight change. In contrast to control and low-dose
arsenic-treated mice, 5FU-treated mice exhibited a significant loss of body weight (Fig. 6B).
This weight loss is most likely caused by 5FU toxicity and not the effect of tumors as we
saw almost complete recession of tumors in these animals (Fig. 6A). Remarkably, the 5FUinduced body weight loss was almost completely prevented in both male and female mice by
the arsenic pretreatment (Fig. 6B).

Author Manuscript

To corroborate the result of body weight measurement, we assessed the effect of low-dose
arsenic at the tissue level and observed a similar protection. 5FU-induced damage to the
small intestine was markedly ameliorated by low-dose arsenic pretreatment (Fig. 6C). The
protective effect of arsenic is also evident in the bone marrow. Bone marrow cell exhaustion
was clearly observed in 5FU-treated mice. However, this decrease of bone marrow
cellularity was considerably alleviated in low-dose arsenic-pretreated mice (Fig. 6D).
Collectively, the results demonstrate that a brief treatment with low-dose arsenic is
associated with a marked protection of normal tissues without compromising the ability of
5FU to kill carcinoma cells.
Since arsenic has been reported as a carcinogen or co-carcinogen (12), it is of great
importance to determine whether the use of arsenic as described aforementioned might
increase cancer risk. Ionizing radiation, a classical carcinogen, was used as a positive control
and indeed induced a significant increase of incidence of cancer, as reflected by the cancerassociated death (16). In contrast, there was no detectable cancer development in both
arsenic-treated and control mice during 12-month period (Fig. 6E), indicating that such a
brief use of low-dose arsenic in mice did not detectably increase cancer risk.

Discussion
p53 and NF-κB are two transcription factors important in controlling cell survival or death
(13). We demonstrate that cellular fate is determined by an integrated interaction of these
two transcription factors. 5FU-induced cell death resulted from p53 activation coupled with
little NF-κB activity. Interestingly, low-dose arsenic provoked a very different effect on
these two transcription factors by inducing reciprocal p53 inhibition and NF-κB activation.
Importantly, p53 suppression seemed to be pre-requisite for NF-κB activation, as shown by

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 15.

that Nutlin 3a-induced p53 activation blocked low-dose arsenic-induced NF-κB activation.
Moreover, the interaction requires a functional p53 as low-dose arsenic failed to stimulate
NF-κB activity and was unable to reduce 5FU toxicity when the expression of p53 was
depleted. The requirement of functional p53 enabled low-dose arsenic to selectively protect
wild-type p53 expressing cells, as demonstrated with the tumor xenograft mouse model in
which pretreatment with low-dose arsenic resulted in protection of animals against 5FUinduced acute toxicity to normal tissues without affecting the anti-tumor efficacy of 5FU.
This requirement of wild type p53 is significant because p53 is very frequently inactivated
in human cancers (10, 13) and the distinct p53 status between normal and tumor tissues
enables low-dose arsenic to preferentially protect normal tissues.

A unique feature of arsenic-induced effects is a biphasic dose response: the effects induced
by low-dose arsenic are not only different in magnitude from that of high-dose arsenic but
also in nature, i.e. cyto-protective versus cytotoxic (12, 14, 15). The protective effects
observed in our study with low-dose arsenic are in agreement with published results. We,
however, expanded the effects of low-dose arsenic to the functional interaction between p53
and NF-κB in regulation of cellular metabolism. We demonstrate that by suppressing p53
activity and permitting NF-κB to act on the metabolic pathways, low-dose arsenic induced a
metabolic shift to glycolysis. NF-κB initiated the glycolytic pathway by up-regulating the
expression of GLUT3 and HIF1α. GLUT3 encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT-3,
facilitating the uptake of glucose. HIF1α is the master transcription factor known to
positively regulate a number of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. This glycolytic induction
is reminiscent of the Warburg effect, which offers the growth and survival advantages(11).
We presented multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate that it was the glycolytic and PPP
pathways that provided cells or tissues the ability to mount the defense mechanism against
5FU toxicity. Low-dose arsenic treatment failed to protect normal cells or tissues when
glycolysis was suppressed by 1) limiting the glucose supply; 2) inhibiting hexokinase
activity with 2-DG; 3) knocking down of LDH or G6PD. Considering Arsenic Trioxide
being currently in clinic use, a brief treatment with low-dose arsenic has the potential as a
novel approach of chemotherapy protection.

Low-dose arsenic treatment induces glycolysis via concerted p53 suppression and NF-κB
stimulation. A, human fibroblasts were pretreated with DMSO or 2-DG (5mM) for 1 h,
followed by either PBS or 100 nM sodium arsenite for 12 h. Culture media were collected
for lactate concentration measurement. B, fibroblasts were treated with either PBS or 100
nM sodium arsenite for 12 h. The cells were subjected to immunostaining with anti-GLUT-1
or GLUT-3 antibodies. C, fibroblasts were pretreated with DMSO (control) or Capsaicin
(300 μM) for 1 h, followed by arsenic for 12 h. The cells were harvested and immunostained
with HIF1α and DAPI. D, fibroblasts were pretreated with DMSO (control) or Nutlin-3A
(10 μM) for 1 h and then arsenic as described in C. The cells were subjected to
immunostaining with anti-GLUT-3 and DAPI. E, fibroblasts were pretreated with DMSO
(control) or Capsaicin (300 μM) followed by arsenic as described in C. The cells were
immunostained with GLUT-3 and DAPI.

Glycolysis is essential for low-dose arsenic-mediated protection. A, human lymphocytes
were cultured in normal (25 mM glucose) or low glucose (2 mM) media, treated as in Fig.
1C and subjected to apoptotic assay. Lymphocytes were pre-treated with 2-DG (5mM) for 1
h prior to addition of 5FU and then analyzed as in Fig. 1C. Human fibroblasts were cultured
in either normal glucose (25 mM) (B) or low glucose (2 mM) (C) media, treated with or
without 100 nM sodium arsenite followed by 5FU (375 μM). The cells were fixed 1 h after
the 5FU-treatment and immunostained with γH2AX. D, fibroblasts were pre-treated with 2DG 1 h and subject to the treatment and analysis as in 1C. Fibroblasts were transfected with
either LDHA RNAi (E) or G6PD RNAi (F). The RNAi knock down efficiency was shown
in the supplemental Fig. 5. The cells were subjected to the treatment as described in B at 48
h post-transfection. G. Fibroblasts were transfected with either control RNAi (GL2RNAi),
LDHARNAi or G6PDRNAi. The cells were treated with 100 nM sodium arsenite 48 h posttransfection for 12 h. Cellular sensitivity to 5FU was assessed by performing a colony
formation survival assay. The numbers are mean ± SD from 3 independent experiments.

The in vivo study of the low-dose arsenic-induced glycolysis. A, all animal procedures were
performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the UTHSCSA Animal Care and Use
Committee. Balb/C mice (4–6 weeks) purchased from Harlan laboratories and maintained
on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with food and water supplied ad libitum were pretreated
(intra-peritoneal injection) with or without sodium arsenite 0.4 mg/kg body weight for
consecutive 3 days. The animals were then treated with 5FU (100 mg/kg body weight) or
DMSO and harvested 24-h later. The small intestines were harvested and the expression of
GLUT-3 was examined by immunohistochemical staining. B, Mice were treated as in A and
live animal imaging was performed using a procedure described in materials and methods to
monitor the uptake of labeled glucose. The optical images are shown. C, mice were treated
as in A. 100 μl saline or 2-DG (200mg/kg body weight) was given via i.v. 12 h prior
harvesting. The small intestines were harvested and stained with H&E.

Low-dose arsenic selectively protects normal tissues without affecting the antitumor
efficacy of 5FU. Athymic nude mice (Balb/cnu/nu, 4–6 weeks old) were from Harlan
laboratories. Human colon carcinoma cell line SW-480 (cells as a 50% suspension in
matrigel) as 3 million cells per mouse in a final volume of 100 μl were injected
subcutaneously at right flank of Balb/c nude mice. When the average tumor volume reached
about 100 mm3, mice were randomized into following groups; control; arsenite only; 5FU
only; arsenite and 5FU. For arsenite pretreatment, mice were treated with sodium arsenite
(0.4 mg/kg body weight) for 3 days (Day 0–3). Mice were then treated with either 5FU
(30mg/kg body weight) via i.v. daily for one week (Day 4–10). Tumor volumes were
measured every four days. Tumor volume was calculated using the equation: (volume =
length × width × depth × 0.5236 mm3). Two independent experiments were done and the
tumor volumes are means ± SE from total of 10 mice per group A (* and # are significantly
different from control, P<0.05). B. Body weight of the mice as described in A was
monitored throughout the experiment. The numbers are means ± SD from two independent
experiments with total of 10 mice per group ($ is significantly different from control,
P<0.05). At the completion of the experiments mice were sacrificed by cervical decapitation.

Tissue samples were harvested for histology experiments. H&E staining were performed.
Representatives of H&E staining of the small intestine (C) and bone marrow (D) were
shown. E. Balb/c mice were treated with PBS or sodium arsenite (0.4 mg/kg body weight)
for three days. Third group of mice were treated with ionizing radiation at a dose of 2 Gy for
total of 3 doses (6Gy). The animals were monitored for 12 months for tumor development
and survival.
