ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis is involved in the development, progression and metastasis of
various human cancers. Herein, we report the discovery of glipizide, a widely used
drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus, as a promising anticancer agent through the
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. By high-throughput screening (HTS) of an FDA
approved drug library utilizing our in vivo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) and yolk sac membrane (YSM) models, glipizide has been identified to
significantly inhibit blood vessel formation and development. Moreover, glipizide
was found to suppress tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis using
xenograft tumor and MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse models. We further revealed that
the anticancer capability of glipizide is not attributed to its antiproliferative effects,
which are not significant against various human cancer cell lines. To investigate
whether its anticancer efficacy is associated with the glucose level alteration induced
by glipizide application, glimepiride, another medium to long-acting sulfonylurea
antidiabetic drug in the same class, was employed for the comparison studies in the
same fashion. Interestingly, glimepiride has demonstrated no significant impact on
the tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that the anticancer effects of glipizide
is not ascribed to its antidiabetic properties. Furthermore, glipizide suppresses
endothelial cell migration and the formation of tubular structures, thereby inhibiting
angiogenesis by up-regulating the expression of natriuretic peptide receptor A. These
findings uncover a novel mechanism of glipizide as a potential cancer therapy, and
also for the first time, provide direct evidence to support that treatment with glipizide
may reduce the cancer risk for diabetic patients.

INTRODUCTION

expressed in the vasculature, kidneys and adrenal glands
while NPRB is expressed in the brain. NPRA is also
expressed in tumor cells (such as lung and prostate cancer
cells) and inhibition of NPRA has been reported to inhibit
tumor growth by suppressing cell proliferation [16-18].
Furthermore, activation of NPRA signaling could result
in tumor growth by inducing stem cell recruitment and
angiogenesis [19].
In this study, by screening of an FDA approved
drug library utilizing our in vivo CAM and YSM models,
glipizide has been identified to significantly inhibit blood
vessel formation and tumor development. Here we report
that glipizide inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in
4T1 transplanted tumor and spontaneous breast cancer in
MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice. Further studies suggest
that glipizide inhibits tumor-induced angiogenesis through
up-regulation of NPRA, thereby suppressing tumor growth
and metastasis.

Angiogenesis is a cellular process that involves
the sprouting of capillaries and configuration of the
neovasculature from existing blood vessels [1,2].
Physiological angiogenesis occurs mainly during
embryogenesis to accommodate the requirements
of development and for this reason, only 0.01% the
epithelial cells (ECs) undergo cell division in adults
[1]. Nevertheless, angiogenesis plays a critical role in
a variety of pathological conditions such as rheumatoid
arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, inflammation, stroke
and carcinogenesis [2,3]. Growth of the solid tumors
requires a corresponding expansion of the vascular
networks to maintain the increasing demand for blood
supply. When this supply is insufficient, it leads to tumor
cell necrosis and apoptosis or metastasis - depending
on the aggressiveness of the neoplastic cells and their
microenvironment [3]. Therefore, developing novel
agents that are capable of inhibiting tumor angiogenesis
represents a new paradigm in cancer prevention and
treatment. Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) and yolk sac membrane (YSM) as in vivo
models of angiogenesis were established and commonly
utilized to facilitate the study of tumor angiogenesis and
development of anti-angiogenic or pro-angiogenic agents
[4,5]. We envisioned that high-throughput screening
(HTS) of commonly used medicines with our in vivo
CAM and YSM assays may lead to the discovery of novel
anticancer therapeutics aimed at tumor angiogenesis.
Glipizide is a widely used drug in the treatment
of type II diabetes since the 1950s because of its ability
to stimulate insulin secretion from β-cells [6-8]. Recent
studies have shown that diabetic patients have higher risks
of developing colorectal, liver, pancreatic and prostate
cancers [9-14]. Intriguingly, epidemic study has revealed
that long-term use of some antidiabetic drugs such as
gliclazide and glibenclamide alone or in combination
with glipizide may result in a reduced risk of developing
cancer in a dose-dependent manner from a cohort study
of 6103 type-2 diabetic patients [15]. Nevertheless, it
remains unclear how this class of antidiabetic drugs is
associate with the decreased cancer risk in the diabetic
patients with these treatments. The findings disclosed
in our study provide the direct evidence to support such
outcomes of glipizide in cancer prevention associated with
the inhibition of angiogenesis.
Natriuretic peptides (NPs) belong to a family of
polypeptide hormones that contains three isoforms: atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). These NPs
are produced by the heart, vasculature and kidney. They
play an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis,
which is mediated by their receptors, natriuretic peptide
receptors A and B (NPRA and NPRB) through the
cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase domains. NPRA is strongly

RESULTS
Glipizide inhibits angiogenesis in CAM and YSM
models
The high-throughput screening of an FDAapproved drug library of 480 compounds was carried
out utilizing our CAM and YSM assays, aiming at the
discovery of potentially new antiangiogenic molecules. In
our initial effort using the CAM approach, 27 potential
antiangiogenic drugs have been identified, and subjected
to the investigation of effects inhibiting angiogenesis
using the YSM assay. Consequently, one compound was
narrowed down out of the 27 compounds (Supplemental
Table S1), leading to the discovery of glipizide (Its
chemical structure shown in Figure 1A) as the most
effective drug in inhibiting angiogenesis.
We further validated the effect of glipizide on
angiogenesis by simply administrating glipizide on the
vascular plexus of CAM and YSM. Chick embryos were
treated with 2, 4 and 8 µg of glipizide or DMSO (control)
for 48 h and then photographed (Figure 1B). We found
that glipizide treatment led to a significant reduction in
the density of CAM blood vessel plexus as compared with
the control (Figure 1C). The YSM model was used to
further confirm that glipizide could inhibit angiogenesis.
Unshelled fertilized eggs were incubated inside sterile
petri dishes for 9 days and then treated with glipizide
(2, 4 and 8 µg) or DMSO for 24 h within plastic rings
(Figure 1D). The vascular beds on the egg yolk were
photographed at 0, 12 and 24 h. The results revealed that
extension of the blood vessel plexus was significantly
inhibited by exposure to glipizide (Figure 1D). The blood
vessel density was also significantly impaired by glipizide
(Figures 1E and 1F). These data suggest that glipizide

chick embryo.

In contrast, glimepiride has no significant effect on the
tumor growth. Compared with the DMSO treatment, the
postprandial blood glucose levels of the mice treated with
the glipizide and glimepiride significantly decreased 30
min later and returned to normal 12 h later (Supplemental
Table S2). Glipizide treatment also significantly reduced
lung metastasis when 4T1 cells were intravenously
administered as compared with the DMSO or glimepiride
group (Figure 2C). Furthermore, glipizide was also found
capable of inhibiting B16F10 melanoma growth and
metastasis (Supplemental Figure S1). In addition, glipizide
abolishes the CD31 staining for MVD (Figure 2D).
However, there were not significant effects on tumor cell
proliferation in glipizide-treated tumor as compared with
the control (Figure 2E). These results collectively suggest
that glipizide inhibits the tumor growth and metastasis
of malignant melanoma and breast cancer by impeding

Glipizide suppresses 4T1 and B16F10 xenograft
tumor growth and metastasis
Given that glipizide is capable of inhibiting
angiogenesis in the chick embryo, we speculated that
glipizide may also suppress tumor-induced angiogenesis,
thereby mitigating tumor growth and metastasis. To
this end, we employed a mouse xenograft model with
mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells. Glipizide (5 mg/kg) and
glimepiride (4 mg/kg) were administered daily for 14 days
after subcutaneous inoculation of 4T1 cells into mouse
mammary fat pad. Glipizide was found to significantly
inhibit tumor growth (Figure 2A) and weight (Figure 2B).

days. Comparison of the control and glipizide treatment
group revealed that the tumor volume in glipizide-treated
mice was significantly reduced (Figure 3A). Meanwhile,
the blood glucose levels were significantly decreased at
30 min after the glipizide treatment (Supplemental Table
S3). The mice were sacrificed and tumors harvested 20
days after the glipizide treatment. There was significant
difference in the tumor weight between control and
glipizide-treated mice (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, it was
found that there were fewer metastasis sites on the
lung surface of glipizide treatment mice (Figure 3C).
Immunohistological staining for CD31 was performed on
the tumor sections. The results demonstrated a reduction in
microvessel density in glipizide-treated tumor as compared
with the control (Figure 3D). However, glipizide had no
significant effect on the BrdU staining for tumor cell
proliferation (Figure 3E).

Glipizide impedes spontaneous tumor growth and
metastasis in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice
The inhibitory effect of glipizide on tumor growth
and metastasis was further investigated using the
spontaneous murine model of breast cancer. MMTVPyMT transgenic mice spontaneously develop widespread
multifocal adenocarcinomas in the entire mammary
epithelium which develop into palpable mammary tumors
in 5 weeks and older mice. These tumors metastasize to
the lung with 80-94% incidence [20]. To study the effect
of glipizide on the spontaneous mammary tumors, we
randomly selected eight MMTV-PyMT mice as the control
and another eight for glipizide treatment (5 mg/kg). The
tumor volumes were measured and calculated every 4

or DMSO (control) once every day. (A) The volume of the breast tumors was measured every day and revealed that the tumor volume
significantly decreased after glipizide treatment. (B) Tumors were weighed on 20 days after inoculation. There was significant difference

control (DMSO) group there was no necrosis amongst the
blood vessels. However, necrosis increased with decrease
in blood vessel density following glipizide treatment
(Figure 4C). Furthermore, we investigated the expression
of VEGFR-2, which is specific in capillary endothelial
cells. It was found that the expression of VEGFR-2 was
gradually down-regulated in blood vessels with increasing
the concentration of glipizide (Figure 4D). These results
indicate that glipizide reduces breast cancer growth by
inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo.

Correlation between tumor growth and angiogenesis
was further investigated by introducing MCF-7 cells to
the surface of 10-day old embryo CAM. The CAM
model allows glipizide (2, 4 and 8 µg) to directly exert
its effect on tumor angiogenesis (Figures 4A, 4B and
4E). We found tumor volume and microvascular density
were significantly reduced following glipizide treatment
in a dose-dependent manner as compared with control
(Figures 4E and 4F). H&E staining revealed that in the

the lungs and the breast tumor were harvested. The presence of metastatic foci on the lung surface was counted and the breast tumors
weighed. The results show glipizide reduces the number of lung metastatic foci but has no effect on the weight of the tumors. (D and E)

Glipizide does not affect 293T, 4T1 and MCF7 cell proliferation, but inhibits the HUVEC

glipizide directly inhibits tumor cell proliferation. Hence,
we evaluated the effects of glipizide on human kidney
epithelial 293T, 4T1 and MCF-7 cell proliferation. These
cells were treated with 1 – 256 µM of glipizide for 48 or
72 h. Cell viability was detected using MTT assay. It was
determined that glipizide exposure on any of these 3 cell
types has no significant impact on cell proliferation at all

Now that glipizide inhibits breast cancer growth
and metastasis in vivo, it is interesting to explore whether

tested dosages (Figures 5A-C).
In view of the effect of glipizide on tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis in CAM and YSM, we
further determined the effect of glipizide on human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) tube formation
in vitro. We found that glipizide, even at the highest
concentration (256 µM) tested, did not appreciably
interfere with HUVEC growth in culture (Figure 5D).
Cell migration, mediated by chemoattractants produced by
vascular endothelial cells, is a hallmark of angiogenesis.
In the CAM & YSM experiments, we observed that
glipizide impaired angiogenesis. Hence, we examined
HUVEC migration inside Boyden Chambers. We
found that glipizide significantly attenuated HUVEC
migration in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5E). We
also performed tube formation assay to determine the

actions of glipizide on capillary formation flowing the
introduction of HUVECs to monolayered Matrigel. As
expected, glipizide-, but not DMSO-, treated HUVECs
were inhibited from developing spider-like microvascular
capillaries in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 5F and
5G).

Glipizide inhibits angiogenesis through induction
of vascular NPRA expression
We performed qRT-PCR array analysis for
angiogenesis associated genes, using RNAs isolated
from DMSO- and glipizide-treated HUVECs. We found
that glipizide significantly induced NPRA expression
amongst 90 known angiogenic related genes (Figure 6A).
Interestingly, glipizide induces NPRA, but not NPRB

(A-C) MTT assay was performed on 293T (human kidney epithelium) (A), 4T1 (mouse breast cancer) (B), and MCF-7 (human breast

(D) HUVEC cells were treated with 1 - 256 µM of glipizide for 48 or 72 h to establish the effect of glipizide on HUVEC proliferation. MTT

boyden chambers. HUVECs suspended various concentrations of glipizide were introduced into the upper chamber and allowed to migrate
through the interposing filter for 12 h. The results show HUVECs migration was significantly reduced in the presence of 10 and 50 µM of
glipizide. (F and G) HUVECs were cultured on matrigel in the presence of glipizide or DMSO for 5 h and the formation tubes were recorded
(G). The length of the tubes was measured and difference between glipizide and DMSO treatment was statistically analyzed (F). Data are

and C, expression (Figure 6B). To confirm this finding,
cultured HUVECs were immunofluorescently stained with
NPRA and CD31 antibodies. Western blotting confirmed
NPRA expression was increased in HUVEC treated with
glipizide and the intensity of staining increased in a dosedependent manner (Figure 6C). The immunofluorescent
staining (Figure 6D and Supplemental Figure S2) also
confirmed such observations. We examined whether
glipizide could also up-regulate NPRA expression in
the tumor endothelial cells of MMTV-PyMT mice. As
expected, treatment of MMTV-PyMT mice with glipizide
but not with DMSO, induced NPRA expression in CD31+
endothelial cells within solid breast tumors (Figure 6E).

The NPRA staining was unevenly distributed along the
tumor-induced vasculature, attesting to the ability of
glipizide to act in vivo.
We assessed the importance of NPRA in
angiogenesis by examining whether silencing NPRA
can promote tube formation by HUVECs while ectopic
expression of NPRA produces an inverse effect.
We acquired plasmids carrying NPRA short-hairpin
RNAs (shRNAs) and full-length NPRA cDNA. It has
demonstrated that after silencing NPRA expression, the
HUVECs increased microvascular tube formation while
over-expression of NPRA inhibited tube formation (Figure
6F and Supplemental Figure S3). Furthermore, glipizide

NPRA overexpression and silencing on vascular tube formation were examined 24 h after electroporation. The full length NPRA cDNA or

HUVEC cells to form tubular structures. Furthermore, the ability of NPRA silencing HUVEC cells to form tubular structures did not change
after glipizide treatment. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. Scale bars = 20 μm in D and E and 100 μm in F.

did not influence HUVECs tube formation after NPRA
was silenced (Figure 6F). These results are consistent
with previous finding that NPRA activation increases
endothelial permeability [21,22], demonstrating the
functional significance of NPRA in modulating vascular
homeostasis.

there was no significant difference of the volume and
weight between glimepiride and DMSO treatment,
indicating the inhibition of tumor growth induced by
glipizide treatment was not attributed to hypoglycemia.
In addition, it was reported that the human plasma
concentrations of glipizide are typically in the range of
50-300 ng/mL in diabetic patients receiving the drug
therapeutically [32]. The glipizide dose of 100 µg per
20 g, which was administered to treat the tumor mice in
our experiments, is consistent with the clinically used
dose according to the body surface area. Therefore, the
plasma concentrations of glipizide in tumor mice receiving
the drug therapeutically are similar to those previously
reported in patients, suggesting that glipizide may have
an excellent safety profile as a potential anticancer drug
for clinic use [33]. Given that bringing a new drug from
discovery to the market is highly time-consuming and a
costly process, repurposing of existing drugs represents
an attractive strategy of cancer drug development [34]. To
this end, our findings have demonstrated the promise of
glipizide as a novel therapeutic that may benefit the cancer
patients.
The tumor xenograft and transgenic mice
experiments implied that angiogenesis might be involved
in the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. We
found that glipizide inhibited angiogenesis, tumor
growth and metastasis in various tumor models. In order
to discriminate the effects of glipizide on tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis, we maintained breast
cancer xenografts on chick CAM. The procedure allowed
us to directly examine the correlation between tumor
tissue and tumor angiogenesis in the presence of glipizide.
Chick CAM assay has been extensively used in the past
for this purpose [35]. We noticed that glipizide reduces the
volume of the growing tumor in a dose-dependent manner.
Likewise, the density of the vascular plexus in the tumor
density also dramatically decreased. Our MTT assay
revealed that glipizide has no significant effect against
tumor cell proliferation. We also discovered that glipizide
inhibited cell migration and the ability of these vascular
endothelial cells to form tubular structures. These findings
support glipizide inhibits tumor angiogenesis which results
in tumor regression but not through suppressing tumor cell
proliferation. Since angiogenesis is essential for tumor
growth and metastasis, it has been widely trumpeted as a
target for limiting tumor growth. Judah Folkman in 1971
was the first to suggest that tumor growth and metastasis
were dependent on angiogenesis, and speculated that
blocking angiogenesis could be an effective approach for
inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis [36]. Given that
antiangiogenic therapy presents advantages over other
anticancer strategy, glipizide as a novel antiangiogenic
inhibitor may be developed as a promising anticancer
agent for clinical use.
To acquire a molecular insight into how glipizide
suppresses angiogenesis, and better understand the

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report a significant finding that
glipizide, a widely used antidiabetic drug, can potently
inhibit angiogenesis by up-regulating NPRA expression in
the vascular endothelial cells. Consequently, this leads to
a reduction in microvessel density which attenuates tumor
growth and metastasis - as determined using xenograft
mouse models with breast carcinoma 4T1 cells and
spontaneous breast carcinoma MMTV-PyMT mice.
The embryonic CAM and YSM assays are
well established methods used in biological and
pharmaceutical research because they are relatively simple
and inexpensive, but highly reproducible [23]. In our
preliminary studies, we used CAM and YSM approaches
to screen an FDA approved drug library consisting of
480 compounds. Utilizing this high-throughput screen,
glipizide has been identified with potent inhibitory
effects on blood vessel formation within CAM and YSM.
As such, we speculated that glipizide might be able to
suppress tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting tumorinduced angiogenesis.
On the other hand, recent pharmacoepidemiological
surveys show that the use of antidiabetic drugs may
influence cancer risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has
been reported that metformin, a widely used antidiabetic
drug, is related to a reduced cancer incidence by acting on
the aging process [24] and can potentiate chemotherapy in
combination with rapamycin [25]. Furthermore, metformin
can prevent breast cancer, especially chemoresistant or
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer, by targeted killing of
cancer stem cell (CSC)-like breast cancer cells [26, 27].
It was reported that the patient treatment with glipizide
or the same class of analogues may be associated with
a lower cancer mortality than that with metformin [28].
Monami et al. [29] found that glibenclamide users had
greater cancer-related mortality than gliclazide users.
They reported that gliclazide treatment reduced cancer
risk compared with that of glibenclamide [30]. It was also
found that the diabetic patients treated with glipizide and
metformin have lower risk to get cancer [31]. However,
the relevant mechanism for such outcomes was unraveled.
Our findings that glipizide attenuates angiogenesis,
tumor growth and metastasis of inoculated mouse
breast cancer 4T1 cells and MMTV-PyMT-driven breast
carcinogenesis have provided direct evidence to support
the cancer preventive and therapeutic effects of glipizide.
Furthermore, we revealed the hypoglycemia developed in
the mice treated with glipizide and glimepiride. However,

relevant signaling pathways that glipizide exerts on the
vascular endothelial cells, we performed qRT-PCR array
analysis on glipizide-treated HUVECs for genes known to
be associated with angiogenesis. We identified NPRA as
the potential target and established that glipizide inhibited
angiogenesis through the induction of NPRA expression in
vascular endothelial cells. Sabrane et al. [22] reported that
NPRA activation increases endothelial cell permeability,
demonstrating that the receptor plays an important role
in modulating vascular homeostasis. Meanwhile, it was
recently reported that in NPRA-KO mice there was
significantly lower angiogenic response compared with
their wild-type counterparts [19]. NPRA has been shown
to be expressed in cancer cells and proposed to be a
potential prognostic marker and a target for cancer therapy
[17,18]. Although Mallela et al. [19] concluded that
NPRA signaling was involved in tumor growth through
regulating angiogenesis, they only demonstrated that the
numbers of CD31+ cells were decreased in the lung cancer
sections of NPRA-KO mice compared with the wild-type
mice by IHC staining. While these studies reported NPRA
promoted cancer development, the relationship between
NPRA and angiogenesis in the other kinds of tumors
was not examined [19]. Here, our in vitro experiment
showed that glipizide could not affect HUVEC tube
formation when NPRA was silenced. For the first time,
we demonstrated the role of glipizide and NPRA in tumorinduce angiogenesis.
Taken together, this study has shown that glipizide
is capable of inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in
the tumor xenograft and transgenic mouse models. The
inhibitory effect was principally achieved through the
suppression of tumor-induced angiogenesis instead of
cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, NPRA has been
identified as one of the potential antiangiogenic molecular
targets for glipizide. While more research efforts are
needed to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms
associated with its suppressive action on tumor growth,
glipizide has demonstrated the great potential to be
developed as a novel and promising anticancer drug for
the treatment of various human cancers.

Company (BML-2840-0100). All the compounds were
marked with a drug code (A0-A19; B0-B19; … X0-X19)
and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Amresco
Company) to prepare 5 mg/mL stock solutions. Glipizide
(cat. no. G117, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved
in DMSO to produce 5 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/
mL stock solutions for validation studies. Mouse breast
cancer 4T1 cell line, human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line,
human renal epithelial 293T cell line and human umbilical
vein endothelial cell line were all purchased from the
Institute of Biological Cells (Chinese academy of sciences,
Shanghai, China).

Chick embryos and mice
Fertilized white leghorn chicken eggs were
obtained from the Avian Farm of South China Agriculture
University (Guangzhou, China). The egg shells were
cleaned using a 1% solution of geramine and then
incubated in an egg incubator at 37.5 oC and 50 - 60%
humidity. Female 6 - 8 week old BALB/c mice were
purchased from the animal center of Guangdong Province
Medical School. MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice were
obtained from the Jackson Memorial Laboratory. All
the mice were weaned and tail-clipped at 4 weeks for
genotyping by PCR. The primer pair used was specific
for the MMTV-PyMT. All the mice were maintained in
accordance with the NIH guidelines.

Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
assay
The CAM assay was performed as previously
described with a slight modification [37]. Briefly, fertilized
eggs were incubated for 9 days and then the shell above
the air chamber was cut using a dental saw to create a
small window (10 × 10 mm2). After removal of the
shell membrane with sterile forceps, 2, 4 and 8 µg of
glipizide (20 μL) were applied directly to the air chamber
of 9-day chick embryos. In the control group, the same
concentration of DMSO in 20 μL of phosphate-buffered
saline was applied. The eggs were then sealed with
sterile medical tape and incubated at 37.8 °C and 60%
humidity. After 48 h incubation, the CAM vasculature
was photographed using a Canon camera. The images
were analyzed using an image analysis program IPP 6.0
(Image Pro-Plus, version 6.0, Media Cybernetics) and the
blood vessel density (percentage of blood vessel area over
the whole area under microscopic field) was calculated.
Each experiment was repeated twice with 10 eggs per

experimental condition.

Chick embryo yolk sac membrane (YSM) assay

4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line was injected
subcutaneously into the second right mammary fat pad
area of 6-8-week-old BALB/c mice. After inoculation,
the mice were then randomly divided into glipizide,
glimepiride (cat. no. G2295, Sigma) or DMSO (control)
treatment. DMSO, glimepiride (4 mg/kg) or glipizide (5
mg/kg, according to clinically used dosage) was injected
intraperitoneally into the 4T1 xenograft mice every day
since the 4T1 cells were inoculated for six days. And
the blood glucose levels were detected by blood glucose
meter. The tumor volume was measured using a vernier
caliper every three days and calculated using the formula:
Volume = length × width2 × 0.52. The mice were treated
with glipizide, glimepiride or DMSO for up to 20 days.
The mice were then sacrificed and the tumors harvested
for weighing and histological analysis.

Eggs were incubated for 3 days and then the chicken
embryos were transferred into sterilized culture dishes. The
individual yolk-sac vessels were oriented facing upward.
Two silastic rings (inside diameter: 9.5 mm; outside
diameter: 12 mm) labeled with red and black marker
pens, respectively, were placed in symmetrical position
over the yolk sac vessel area of the chicken embryos. The
culture dishes were then covered tightly before returning
to the incubator. 40 µL of glipizide (50, 100 and 200
µg/mL in gelatin) and DMSO were introduced into the
rings of healthy embryos with well-developed vessels.
Photographs of the vessels within the rings were captured
at 0 h, 2 h and 24 h using an Image acquisition OPTPRO
2007 system. The images were quantitatively analyzed
using an Image-Pro Plus 6.0 system, as described for the
CAM assay.

1 × 105 4T1 cells were injected into the tail vein
of BALB/c mice followed by treatment with DMSO,
glimepiride (4 mg/kg) or glipizide (5 mg/kg) on the same
day of inoculation for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, the mice
were sacrificed, and their brains, lungs, livers, and kidneys
were collected for analysis. The tissue samples were
analyzed for the presence of metastatic foci and histology.

A 20 µL aliquot of DMSO (control) or 50 µg/mL of
one of 480 drugs (FDA-approved drug library) was added
to each of the embryonic CAM or YSM membrane in the
egg shell openings. The effect of all the tested compounds
on angiogenesis was evaluated using the CAM and YSM
assays.

MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice

MCF-7 breast cancer assay on CAM

Nine-week-old
MMTV-PyMT
mice
were
intraperitoneally injected with DMSO or glipizide (5 mg/
kg) for 20 days. These mice spontaneous develop breast
carcinoma. The tumors were measured every three days
and the tumor volume was calculated: length × width2 ×
0.52. After 20 days, the mice were sacrificed and their
tumors and lungs were collected for weighing, histological
analysis and pulmonary metastatic foci counting.

To evaluate the direct effect of glipizide on
angiogenesis, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured
and maintained on the CAM of 10 day-old chick embryos
[38]. Briefly, a 1 cm-diameter  window was created in the
shell of each 10 day-old fertilized egg. The CAM was
exposed and a silastic ring was placed on top of the CAM.
Then 40 µL of 0-200 µg/mL (2, 4 and 8 µg) glipizide was
added to the center of the ring on day 12. On day 14, the
eggs were cut carefully along the axis of the median line
and the content was discarded. The gross morphology
of each CAM was recorded using a stereomicroscope
(SZX16 Olympus). The antiangiogenic effect of glipizide
was evaluated by comparing the number of secondand third-order blood vessels with CAM treated with
DMSO (control). The size (volume) of the breast tumors
present on the CAM was calculated (length × width2 ×
0.52). Statistical  analysis  of second-  and third-order
vessels was performed  using  2-tailed Student’s t-test.

Immunohistological
staining

and

immunofluorescent

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent
staining were performed on 3-μm and 6-μm sections,
respectively. Before immunohistochemical staining,
transgenic and 4T1 xenograft mice were intraperitoneally
injected with 100 mg/kg of 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine
(BrdU; cat. no. B5002, Sigma). Briefly, the sections
were dewaxed, hydrated and incubated anti-CD31 (1:100
dilution, cat. no. sc-1506, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), antiBrdU (1:100 dilution, cat. no. sc-32323, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) and anti-NPRA (1:100 dilution, cat. no.
sc-25485, Santa Cruz) primary antibodies, overnight

at 4 oC. The binding of the primary antibodies to cells/
tissues was detected using the appropriate fluorescently
labeled secondary antibody or HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody plus DAB. All sections were the counterstained
with hematoxylin or DAPI. The density of microvessels
was quantified by counting the number of CD31+ vessels
in a 200× field [39]. For BrdU quantitation, fields were
randomly selected in a 400× field and the number of
BrdU+ cells were counted as a percentage of the total cells
per field. The NPRA expression levels were quantified
using an image analysis program IPP 6.0 (Image ProPlus, version 6.0, Media Cybernetics) in a 400 × field and
evaluated by two experimenters.

Boyden Chamber Transwells were used to evaluate
cell migration ability. HUVEC cells were maintained in
serum-free media for 5 h. Cell migration was examined
as a standard protocol. Briefly, a porous polycarbonate
membrane (8-μm pore diameter; cat. no. PFB8, Neuro
Probe, ) was coated with 1% gelatin (Sigma) for 1 h and
sterilized. HUVEC cells were harvested and suspended
in serum-free EBM medium containing different
concentrations of glipizide. 50 µL of cells (2.5 × 104 cells)
were introduced to the upper chamber of the transwell and
the lower chambers were added culture medium containing
20% FBS plus various growth factors (SDF1, HB-EGF,
VEGF and HGFApoG2). The polycarbonate membrane
was inserted between the upper and lower chambers.
After the cells in the Boyden Chamber were incubated at
37 ºC for 12 h, the cells were then removed from the upper
side of the membrane by using a cotton swab. And then
the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet for 3 h after
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The cells were
counted using a microscope at 4 × magnification.

In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed to
determine a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2
(VEGFR-2) [38]. The PCR product (365 bp) was cloned
into T-vector with T3 and T7 promoter and the riboprobe
was labeled with dNTP containing Bio-dUTP through
transcribing T3 promoter transcriptase. After the tumor
tissue sections were treated by proteinase K (0.2 mg/
mL), the probe was incubated overnight at 37°C. Then
the Digxion-Avidin was used to bind the probe and at
last the tissue sections were stained with DAB. The PCR
primer is as follows: AAGAGGATTCGGGCCTCTCT,
CCCTGACTGGTAGCCACTTG.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from HUVEC cells that
have been treated with glipizide or DMSO (control). The
PCR array was performed using a TaqMan-based qPCR
assay kit (cat. no. PAMM-024A; SA Biosciences). An ABI
PRISM 7000HT Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems) was used for all qPCR analysis. Triplicate
qPCR reactions were performed for each of the samples
analyzed.

MTT assay
MTT assay was performed to determine the effect
of glipizide on cell proliferation. Briefly, cells were
introduced into 96 well plates and then treated with
various dose of glipizide. After incubation for 48-72 h,
10 µL of MTT reagent was added to each well. The plates
were incubated at 37 ºC for 4 h and then the supernatant
removed. The resultant formazan crystals were dissolved
using 150 µL of DMSO (Sigma). The absorption was read
at 570 nm through a spectrophotometer. The assay was
performed in triplicate.

Western blotting
HUVECs cells were harvested and suspended
in lysis buffer to extract whole-cell protein. 60 µg of
total protein was then separated by SDS-PAGE (10%
polyacrylamide gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Antibody against NPRA was purchased
from Santa Cruz, and the immunoblotting was performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Tube formation assay

Over-expression and silencing NPRA

The effect of glipizide on vascular tube formation
was determined using HUVEC cells. The cells (1.5 × 105
cells/mL) in suspended EBM were uniformly spread onto
growth factor-reduced matrigel in 96-well chamber. After
the plates were incubated for 5 h at 37 ºC, the presence
of vascular tubes was photographed using a phase
contrast inverted microscope. The length of the tubes was
measured using image analysis software.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Full length NPRA cDNA or short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) constructs that targeted the NPRA transcript
were purchased from Open Biosystems. Cells were
transfected with these constructs along with plasmid
carrying the green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker.
The efficacy of these constructs in over-expressing and
silencing NPRA was validated by immunoblotting using
NPRA antibody.
