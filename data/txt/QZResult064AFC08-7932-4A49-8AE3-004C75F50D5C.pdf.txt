Abstract
The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is emerging as a novel
target in many solid tumors, including lung cancer. PHA665752 was identified as a small molecule, ATP competitive
inhibitor of the catalytic activity of the c-Met kinase. Here, we
show that treatment with PHA665752 reduced NCI-H69 (small
cell lung cancer) and NCI-H441 (non–small cell lung cancer)
tumorigenicity in mouse xenografts by 99% and 75%,
respectively. Reduction in tumor size was also observed by
magnetic resonance imaging of tumors in mice. PHA665752
inhibited c-Met phosphorylation at the autophosphorylation
and c-Cbl binding sites in mouse xenografts derived from
non–small cell lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H441 and A549) and
small cell lung cancer cell line (NCI-H69). PHA665752 also
inhibited angiogenesis by >85% in all the abovementioned cell
lines and caused an angiogenic switch which resulted in a
decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor
and an increase in the production of the angiogenesis
inhibitor thrombospondin-1. These studies show the feasibility of selectively targeting c-Met with ATP competitive small
molecule inhibitors and suggest that PHA665752 may provide
a novel therapeutic approach to lung cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
There will be >213,000 cases of lung cancer and >160,000 deaths
from lung cancer in 2007 (1). Unfortunately, even with the best
of therapies, the overall survival for non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is 16%, whereas for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), overall
survival is 6% (1). In order to enhance the survival for patients
with lung cancer, basic molecular mechanisms have to be
discerned with the potential for novel therapeutics. Receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) seem to be an important therapeutic target
in malignancies (2).
c-Met is a RTK that is expressed during normal development and
can be altered in a number of malignancies. The ligand for c-Met is
the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and activation of c-Met with
HGF can lead to cell growth and viability, cell motility, angiogenesis, as well as transformation of cells (3). c-Met can not only
be activated via its ligand, but also through amplification or

mutation (3). We have previously shown that c-Met is overexpressed in 67% adenocarcinomas and 35% of SCLC (4, 5).
Approximately 10% to 15% of adenocarcinomas of the lung and
SCLC have a mutation in the semaphorin or juxtamembrane
domains of lung cancer, and not in the tyrosine kinase domain
(4, 5). Activation of c-Met in lung cancer leads to enhanced cell
proliferation, increased cell motility, increased production of
reactive oxygen species (6), and activation of several signal
transduction pathways such as the focal adhesion and phosphatidylinositol-3¶-kinase/Akt pathway (4, 5). Because c-Met has a large
effect on biological and biochemical signaling, it is important to
particularly target this pathway.
c-Met and HGF are dysregulated in human cancers and are also
believed to contribute to dysregulation of cell growth, tumor cell
dissemination, and tumor invasion during disease progression and
metastasis (7). Cell lines engineered to express high levels of c-Met
and HGF (autocrine loop) or mutant c-Met displayed a proliferative, motogenic, and/or invasive phenotype and grew in clusters
as metastatic tumors in nude mice (8, 9). In addition, transgenic
mice overexpressing c-Met, HGF, or mutant c-Met display a
tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype (10, 11).
The clinical therapeutic targeting of c-Met is just beginning to
come to fruition. There are several strategies to inhibit the HGF/cMet axis. Small interference RNA (siRNA) against c-Met has been
used in lung cancer cell lines with reduced cell growth and
enhanced apoptosis (4). Antibodies such as 5D5 against c-Met have
also been shown to be effective in cell line models (12). Most
recently, small molecule inhibitors such as SU11274 and
PHA665752 have been used against lung cancer cell lines in tissue
cultures with considerable success (4, 5). Treatment of lung cancer
cell lines with SU11274 and PHA665752 leads to decreased cell
growth, decreased cell motility, decreased production of reactive
oxygen species, as well as eventual apoptosis (4, 5). Interestingly,
Smolen et al. (13) have recently found that cancer cells with high
levels of stable chromosomal amplification of c-Met are extraordinarily susceptible to the selective inhibitor PHA-665762. At this
time, animal models to inhibit c-Met have not been tested against
lung cancer and would be an effective screening approach in the
preclinical development of targeted drugs.
In this study, we have evaluated the effects of the specific c-Met
inhibitor, PHA665752, against the mouse models of H69 SCLC and
H441 NSCLC. We find specific reduction of tumor growth with
PHA665752 in the lung cancer models. This was also reflected in
radiological imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We
also find that treatment with PHA665752 resulted in a decrease in
the number of blood vessels (as assessed with CD31 staining) and a
switch in the angiogenic phenotype which resulted in a decrease in
the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and

importance of therapeutically targeting c-Met in lung cancer, we

Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, NSCLC and SCLC

Animals
Five-week-old male Ncr-nu (Nude) mice were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and hosted in the pathogen-free
animal facility at the University of Chicago. Animal treatments were done
according to institution-approved protocols.

Treatment of Nude Mice for Studying the Effect of c-Met
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors on Tumorigenicity and
Immunohistochemistry of Tumors
NCI-H441, A549, and NCI-H69 cells were cultured and harvested with
trypsin/EDTA. The viability of these cells was determined by trypan blue
and only cell populations with 90% or greater viability were used for this
investigation. The tumorigenicity of these lung cancer cells was determined
by intradermally injecting 5  106 viable cells in balanced salt solution into

the flank or leg region of nude mice to produce s.c. tumors. Once daily
intratumoral injections of PHA665752, were given 8 days after the lung
cancer cells were injected when tumors were visible. One group of animals
was given PHA665752 (16.5 Ag in 100 AL of 2% DMSO) and group 2 was
injected with diluent (2% DMSO) alone. The mice were euthanized at the
indicated times and tumors were measured with calipers, fixed in 4%
formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with H&E.
Immunohistochemical staining of tumors was done using monoclonal
antibodies against CD31, VEGF, TSP-1, and phosphospecific antibodies to
c-Met pY1230/1234/1235 and pY1003. The immunostaining procedures used
have been previously described by Ma et al. (4). Appropriate negative
controls for the immunostaining were prepared by omitting the primary
antibody step and substituting it with nonimmune rabbit serum. To
estimate the number of blood vessels in tumors before and after treatment,

A, immunostaining of NCI-H441 in tumor xenografts treated with diluent (2% DMSO; left) or treated with PHA665752 (right ) for 2 wks. There was a great
decrease in staining and fewer number of vessels were seen after treatment with PHA66572. There was a 91% decrease in the number of blood vessels when
vessels were counted in 10 microscopic fields. B, immunostaining with CD31 described above in A549 cells treated with diluent (left ) and PHA66572 (right ) for
6 wks; a similar decrease in immunostaining and vessel number was seen in A549 cells. C, immunostaining with CD31 in H69 tumor xenografts treated with
diluent (left ) or PHA66572 (right ) for 3 wks. In these SCLC tumor xenografts, a great decrease in immunostaining and vessel number was also seen after
treatment with PHA66572 in comparison to tumors treated with diluent.

10 microscopic fields were counted at 20 magnification and the number of
blood vessels were evaluated. All of the slides were reviewed and scored by
two investigators independently.

MRI Protocol
Animal preparation. Mice were anesthetized with 1.5% to 2% isoflurane.
A SA Instruments (Brooklyn, NY) physiologic monitoring system was
implemented to acquire electrocardiogram and respiratory signals for
motion gating. Body temperature was maintained at 38jC with a resulting
400 to 450 cardiac rate.
MRI. All MRI experiments were conducted on a Bruker 4.7 T animal
scanner with 20 G/cm gradients. Control and treated H69 tumors were
imaged and spin echo images were acquired with a 4.7 T animal scanner
with the following variables: TR/TE = 1,500/10 to 20 ms, FOV = 3 cm, array
size = 256  256, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, NEX = 1.

Results
Effect of PHA665752 on lung cancer tumor size in nude
mice. In order to determine whether PHA665752 can affect the
growth of preexisting tumors, 5  106 NCI-H69 cells which are
derived from SCLC were injected s.c. into the flank of nude mice.
Beginning 8 days later, when small tumor nodules were apparent,
the sites were injected once daily with PHA665752 (16.5 Ag in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

100 AL of 2% DMSO) or an equal volume of 2% DMSO alone. The
tumors were injected intratumorly because the drug is sparingly
soluble in water and we were interested in delivering an effective
dose directly into the tumor, and in comparing the results of
intratumoral delivery with the results of Christensen et al. (7), who
gave the drug i.v. to gastric carcinomas. The dose of PHA665752
used in this study was 0.825 mg/kg/d, a dose much lower than used
by the study from Christensen et al. (7), in which a dose of 15 to
30 mg/kg/d was used and was found to be a more effective
inhibitor of tumor growth. After 3 weeks, animals were euthanized
and the tumor size was determined. There was a very significant
difference in tumor size between diluent and PHA665752-treated
mice (Fig. 1A and B), and tumors were clinically undetectable in
5 out of 10 mice, as seen by immunohistochemistry, which shows
the complete absence of tumors at the treated site (Fig. 1C). The
tissue surrounding the injected tumor nodules appeared normal in
all animals. PHA665752 treatment reduced tumor volume
(P < 0.0001) by 99% as determined by measurement of the tumors
with calipers (Fig. 1D) and by an animal MRI scanner (Fig. 1B).
The effect of treatment with PHA665752 was also studied in
tumor xenografts from NCI-H441 and A549, which were derived
from NSCLC. NCI-H441 cells were treated as described above and it

was found that tumor growth was inhibited by 75% (Fig. 1E).
Treatment with PHA665752 also inhibited the growth of A549 cells
by 59% (data not shown).
Immunohistochemistry and angiogenesis of tumors.
PHA665752 treatment reduced the expression of phospho c-Met
pY1230/1234/1235 (autophosphorylation site) and pY1003 (c-Cbl
binding site) in the small residual tumor nodules (Fig. 2) in both
NCI-H69 (Fig. 2A) cells and A549 cells (Fig. 2B). These results
indicate that reduction in c-Met phosphorylation has a very
significant effect on tumor proliferation.

Treatment with PHA665752 also resulted in >85% reduction
(Fig. 3A–C) in the number of blood vessels seen by CD31 staining
in NCI-H441, A549, and NCI-H69 indicating that inhibition of
vessel formation may be one of the mechanisms by which
PHA665752 inhibits tumor growth. We further immunostained
H69 tumors for the expression of VEGF and TSP-1. We found a
statistically significant up-regulation of TSP-1 (Fig. 4A) and a
concomitant down-regulation of VEGF (Fig. 4B). These results
indicate that a switch from an angiogenic to an angioinhibitory
phenotype is one of the potential mechanisms by which
treatment with PHA665752 resulted in a change in the angiogenic
status of NCI-H69 tumor xenografts.

Discussion

modulating the expression of VEGF and TSP-1. NCI-H69 tumor xenografts
were treated with diluent or PHA665752 for 3 wks as described in Fig. 1.

c-Met is an important therapeutic target against lung cancer
(4, 5). With the dismal prognosis of lung cancer, it is crucial to
discover novel targets to ultimately bring to clinical fruition. In
this study, we show that in both SCLC and NSCLC xenograft nude
mouse models that there was significant tumor growth reduction
after treatment with c-Met–specific small molecule inhibitor
PHA665752. We have previously published in cell line models that
PHA665752 is a specific inhibitor of c-Met with an IC50 of
0.06 Amol/L. PHA665752 also synergized with mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin to cause apoptosis (14). We also show that there is
decreased activation of c-Met with this specific inhibitor via
immunohistochemistry. The angiogenic properties of the c-Met/
HGF axis are well known (3) and can result in a critical
angiogenic switch by Shc for VEGF production (15). We provide
the first evidence of antiangiogenic effects of inhibiting c-Met in
the mouse model with PHA665752 and show for the first time
that treatment with PHA665752 results in a change in the
angiogenic phenotype resulting in an increase in the production
of angiogenesis inhibitor TSP-1 with a concomitant decrease in
VEGF production.
Small molecule inhibitors, specifically against c-Met, represent
an attractive novel targeted therapeutic approach. We have
reported, for the first time, the effectiveness of a novel small
molecule–specific inhibitor of c-Met, SU11274 (Pfizer; previously
Sugen), in cells transformed by the oncogenic Tpr-Met as a model,
as well as in SCLC and NSCLC (4, 16). Inhibition of the Met kinase
activity by the drug SU11274 led to time- and dose-dependent
reduced cell growth, and induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Met kinase autophosphorylation was reduced on sites that have
been previously shown to be important for the activation of
pathways involved in cell growth and survival, especially the
phosphatidylinositol-3¶-kinase and the Ras pathway (16). The
characterization of SU11274 as an effective inhibitor of Met
tyrosine kinase activity illustrates the therapeutic potential of
targeting Met in cancers associated with activated forms of this
kinase. Similar results were seen with PHA665752 in a study by
Ma et al. (4). The use of siRNA is another novel approach to study
the effects of inhibition on RTKs (4). In lung cancer CL-1 cells,
siRNA has been used to inhibit the membrane-anchored glycoprotein RECK and has shown that histone-deacetylase inhibitors
suppress tumor invasion with their inhibitory effect on MMP-2
activation mediated via RECK (17).
In lung cancer, we have identified that there are specific
mutations/alterations of the c-Met gene in the juxtamembrane
domain, semaphorin domain, and an alternative spliced product at
exon 10 (4, 5). The juxtamembrane domain serves as a negative

regulator of the tyrosine kinase domain, and once mutated, there is
activation of the tyrosine kinase domain of c-Met. Interestingly,
H69 SCLC used in the above study harbors an R988C mutation in
the juxtamembrane domain (5) and thus may be more responsive
to the PHA665752. Juxtamembrane domains of RTKs are thought
to be key regulators of catalytic functions (18).
Besides missense mutations, c-Met–mediated tumorigenesis can
be a result of gene amplification, as seen in human gastric
carcinoma via the break-fusion-bridge mechanism (19). In gastric
cancer cell lines with c-Met amplification, it has also been shown
that treatment with PHA-665752 triggers massive apoptosis (13). As
we discern specific mutations of c-Met in the context of various
tumors, it would be useful to determine the effect of c-Met
inhibition with the wild-type and mutated forms of c-Met in a
mouse model. Ultimately, it is also suspected that some tumor cells
may escape the vigilance of c-Met inhibition, which may lead to

resistance. Thus, for lung cancer, which is responsive to cytotoxic
chemotherapies such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, and erlotinib it would be useful to combine the novel
c-Met–targeted therapy with these agents.
In this study, we show that c-Met can be targeted via the small
molecule inhibitor PHA665752 in lung cancer through xenograft
mouse models. It would now be useful to bring to clinical fruition
compounds such as PHA665752 against lung cancer.
