Abstract
Combination chemotherapy regimen incorporating CD20
antibodies are commonly used in the treatment of CD20positive non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Fludarabine phosphate (F-araAMP), cyclophosphamide, and CD20 antibodies
(Rituximab) constitute the FCR regimen for treating selected
NHL, including aggressive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). As an
alternative to the CD20 antibody, we generated a CD20targeted measles virus (MV)–based vector. This vector was
also armed with the prodrug convertase purine nucleoside
phosphorylase (PNP) that locally converts the active metabolite of F-araAMP to a highly diffusible substance capable of
efficiently killing bystander cells. We showed in infected cells
that early prodrug administration controls vector spread,
whereas late administration enhances cell killing. Control of
spread by early prodrug administration was also shown in an
animal model: F-araAMP protected genetically modified mice
susceptible to MV infection from a potentially lethal intracerebral challenge. Enhanced oncolytic potency after extensive
infection was shown in a Burkitt’s lymphoma xenograft model
(Raji cells): After systemic vector inoculation, prodrug
administration enhanced the therapeutic effect synergistically.
In a MCL xenograft model (Granta 519 cells), intratumoral
(i.t.) vector administration alone had high oncolytic efficacy:
All mice experienced complete but temporary tumor regression, and survival was two to four times longer than that of
untreated mice. Cells from MCL patients were shown to be
sensitive to infection. Thus, synergy of F-araAMP with a PNParmed and CD20-targeted MV was shown in one lymphoma
therapy model after systemic vector inoculation. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Oncolytic virotherapy, the treatment of cancer patients with
replication-competent viruses, has progressed from preclinical
experiments to phase III clinical trials in humans (1–3). The clinical
trials have shown the safety of this approach, and oncolytic viruses
are now combined with chemotherapy (4) and radiotherapy (5), or
suicide gene therapy (6), to increase efficacy. The first oncolytic
therapy regimen was recently approved (7).

The oncolytic efficacy of recombinant measles viruses (MV) is
being assessed in an ovarian cancer trial nearing completion and in
recently opened glioma and myeloma clinical trials.4 A phase I
study of i.t. injections of the unmodified MV Zagreb vaccine strain
in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas showed safety as well
as clinical responses (8).
MV lymphotropism is an asset for lymphoma treatment.
Spontaneous tumor regressions of lymphoma (9) and leukemia
(10) was repeatedly observed after contagion with wild-type MV.
Experimental studies based on human tumor xenografts in
immunodeficient mice treated with a MV vaccine lineage strain
confirmed a strong oncolytic effect (11, 12).
MV oncolytic specificity can be retargeted based on single-chain
antibodies displayed on the viral attachment protein, hemagglutinin (H; refs. 13, 14). For hematologic malignancies, viruses
recognizing CD20 (15) and CD38 (16) were generated; however,
lack of information about the mechanism of MV cell entry through
the natural receptors SLAM (17) and CD46 (18) initially did not
allow the production of recombinant viruses exclusively recognizing the target protein. The recent identification of the H protein
residues essential to enter cells through the natural receptors (19)
allows generation of viruses fully retargeted at the cell entry level
(20, 21).
Non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematologic malignancy and accounts yearly for f18,000 deaths in the
United States (22). Therapeutic options include chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and biological agents, including antibodies against
CD20 (23). The FCR therapeutic regimen, a combination of
fludarabine phosphate (F-araAMP), cyclophosphamide, and the
Rituximab CD20 monoclonal antibody, is a frontline treatment for
selected NHL, and is used as a salvage regimen in mantle cell
lymphoma (MCL; refs. 24, 25).
The integral surface membrane protein CD20 is expressed on
both normal and neoplastic B cells but not in other tissues (26).
CD20 monoclonal antibodies can be effective therapeutics for NHL
(27). Their mechanism of action is not fully understood; however,
immune-mediated effects and antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity in combination with direct effects of CD20 binding
may cause cytotoxicity (28). Levels of B cells are temporarily
strongly reduced by anti-CD20 therapy; despite this, adverse events
are minimal. Thus, B-cell depletion through a CD20-targeted virus
may be well tolerated.
To improve efficacy of the FCR regimen, we seek to substitute
the CD20 antibody with a CD20-targeted virus armed with a
prodrug convertase locally activating F-araAMP. The active
metabolite of F-araAMP, fludarabine, can be activated by the

prodrug convertase Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) to 2-fluoroadenine. PNP also converts 6-methylpurine2¶-deoxyriboside (MeP-dR) to 6-methylpurine. 2-Fluoroadenine and
6-methylpurine are highly diffusible and can be metabolized to
toxic ATP analogues, which inhibit DNA, RNA, and protein
synthesis immediately (29). In a conventional approach without
PNP, fludarabine is not metabolized to 2-fluoroadenine and,
therefore, is not as effective. Thus, local activation of F-araAMP
by PNP should enhance its therapeutic efficacy.
In this study, we generated a MV that can enter cells exclusively
through CD20, and armed it with PNP. We show in a Burkitt’s
lymphoma preclinical model that this oncolytic vector activates
fludarabine locally, enhancing its therapeutic effect synergistically
after systemic administration. In a MCL model, oncolytic efficacy of
i.t. vector administration was very high.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Vero African green monkey kidney cells, HT1080, and
human Burkitt’s lymphoma Raji cells were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). MCL cells (Granta 519) were a gift of Dr.
Thomas Witzig (30). All cells were grown at 37jC in medium recommended
by the ATCC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Vero-aHis, Vero-SLAM,
and HT1080-CD20 were generated by stable transfection of the parental
Vero and HT1080 cells, respectively, as described previously (15, 21, 31).
Patient samples. Primary MCL cells were recovered from surgically
removed spleen tissue (two patients) or peripheral blood (one patient).
Fresh tissue was cut up and minced over a wire mesh to obtain a single-cell
suspension. The cell suspension was overlaid on Ficoll-Hypaque (GE
Healthcare) and centrifuged to isolate the mononuclear cell layer. Diluted
peripheral blood cells were similarly centrifuged on Ficoll. The cells were
washed with RPMI 1640 and then aliquoted into 1 mL cryovials in freezing
medium (RPMI 1640, 10% DMSO, and 20% FCS), and samples were frozen in
liquid nitrogen freezers for long-term storage. For flow cytometry, the
cultured cells were run for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Acquisition and analysis was
done using Becton Dickinson CellQuest Pro software. Ten thousand events
were collected both ungated and gated on the live population as
determined by scatter properties for each sample.
Construction of recombinant MV. The E. coli PNP gene was PCR
amplified from pSV-PNP (32) using primers providing the appropriate MluI
and AatII restriction sites. The MluI/AatII–digested PCR product was
cloned into the MV full-length cDNA using the corresponding restriction
sites, resulting in p(+)MV-PNP. The plasmid pCGHXaCD20 (15) was used as
template to insert the CD46- and SLAM-ablating mutations at residue
positions 481, 533, 548, and 549. The sequence coding for the H6 peptide
was synthesized as single-stranded oligonucleotides in reverse complementary orientation, and subcloned via NotI and SpeI in pCGHmut(481, 533,
548, 549)XaCD20. The PacI/SpeI–digested fragment with the retargeted
H was exchanged for the corresponding fragment of p(+)MVEGFP and
p(+)MV-PNP, respectively. The resulting full-length cDNAs were named
p(+)MVgreenHblindantiCD20 and p(+)MV-PNP HblindantiCD20. For rescue of
fully retargeted viruses, a modified system was used as described previously
(21). To prepare virus stocks, Vero-aHis cells were infected with each MV
at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.03 and incubated at 37jC for 36 h.
Viruses were harvested by one freeze-thaw cycle from their cellular
substrate resuspended in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Titers were determined by
50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) titration on Vero-aHis cells.
Immunoblot analysis. Viral samples (5,000 TCID50) were directly
mixed with an equal volume of SDS loading buffer [130 mmol/L
Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and
100 mmol/L DTT]. These samples were denatured for 5 min at 95jC;
fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; blotted to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad); and immunoblotted with anti-measles
nucleocapsid (N) protein antibody (Novus Biologicals) at 1:5,000 dilution,

with anti-PNP antibody (a kind gift of Dr. Jeong S. Hong) at 1:10,000
dilution, and with anti-measles H protein antibody at 1:10,000 dilution
according to BM Chemiluminescence Blotting kit (Roche). After washing
the primary antibody, the secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (KPL) was applied at 1:10,000
dilution for N protein detection. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(Calbiochem) at 1:5,000 dilution or 1:10,000 dilution, respectively, was
applied for detection of H protein and PNP.
Virus infection and titration. Each cell line (5  105 adherent cells or
6
10 suspension cells in a six-well plate) was incubated with each MV at a
MOI of 0.5 in Opti-MEM for 3 h at 37jC. The TCID50 was determined by the
method of Kärber (33) on Vero-aHis cells. At the end of the incubation
period, free viruses were removed and cells were maintained in the
appropriate medium. At 36 h after infection, cells were photographed under
phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy, respectively.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT; Cell Proliferation kit I,
Roche) assay. Cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates (5  104 per
well) in the recommended culture medium in presence or absence of
prodrug, respectively. Infection at MOI 0.01, 0.1, 1, and mock was done by
adding the corresponding virus preparation to the cells. Cell viability was
measured by dye absorbancy as determined by absorbance measurement at
595 nm on an automated ELISA reader. Viability of cells treated with or
without prodrugs after infection with different MOIs or uninfected,
respectively, was calculated as the mean of quadruplicate absorbance
values divided by the mean of quadruplicate absorbance values of
identically cultured cells in the absence of prodrug and virus (control cells)
and expressed as percentage of control cells. The MTT assay was done as
recommended by the manufacturer.
Measurement of E. coli PNP activity. Crude cell extracts were prepared
as described previously (34) from s.c. implanted Raji cell tumors (human
lymphoma) transduced with a total dose of 5  106 MV-PNP HblindantiCD20,
obtained 6 days after first virus administration. The extracts were incubated
with various concentrations of MeP-dR, and the formation of product was
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the
reaction mixture. Activity was expressed as PNP units; one unit represents 1
nmol MeP-dR–converted/mg protein/h.
In vivo experiments for assessment of safety. All experimental
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Transgenic, 8-week-old Ifnarko-CD46Ge mice were anesthetized
using isoflurane and injected intracranially in the right cerebral hemisphere
by puncturing the cranium f2 mm laterally of the sagittal suture using an
intradermal needle and a Hamilton syringe. MV (5  105 infectious units)
suspended in 20 AL of Opti-MEM were inoculated. Each experimental group
consisted of six mice.
In vivo experiments for detection of tumor targeting and transgene
expression. Tumors were established by inoculating Raji cells (107/100 AL
per site) into the right flanks of 6- to 8-week-old severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Harlan). When tumors measured 20 to
40 AL, mice received either five i.t. or five i.v. injections of MV-PNP
HblindantiCD20 at 106 infectious units in 100 AL Opti-MEM (5  106 infectious units; virus titer determined on Vero-aHis cells), on days 6, 7, 8, 9, and
10 postimplantation. Six days after first injection, mice were sacrificed, and
the tumors were harvested and halved. One half was dissolved in RNAlater
buffer (Ambion). Levels of MV N mRNA in tumors harvested from each
group (n = 4) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) as described previously (35). The other tumor half was used for
PNP activity measurements.
In vivo experiments for assessment of efficacy. Raji cell and MCL
xenografts were established and treated as described above. F-araAMP
(250 mg/kg/dose) was injected i.p. on days 11, 12, and 13 after implantation.
Control animals (mock therapy groups) were injected with equal volumes of
Opti-MEM containing no virus. Each experimental group consisted of 10
mice. Tumor diameters were measured every 3rd day and the volume
(product of 0.5  length  length  width) was calculated as mean F SE
for each group. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment,
when tumor burden reached a volume of 1,500 AL (f10 % of body

weight). Animals that died without carrying large tumors (<1,500 AL) were
excluded from the survival analysis; necropsy did not reveal drug-related
symptoms.
Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed by using the ANOVA test to
compare the treatment groups for tumor volume analysis. The two-sample
t test was used to make pairwise comparisons between the treatment
groups. Survival data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the
log-rank test was used to test for significance between all the groups.
Because only mice that had the event of interest were analyzed, the two-

sample t test was also used to make pairwise comparisons between the
groups. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant and the JMP
program version 6 was used for all analyses.

receptors CD46 (18) and SLAM (17), and fused to a single-chain
antibody conferring selective entry through the B-lymphocyte
antigen CD20 (ref. 15; Fig. 1A). To facilitate virus production, a
COOH-terminal histidine hexapeptide was added to the MV
HblindantiCD20 hybrid protein (21). To gain control over viral
replication and to improve oncolytic properties, the E. coli PNP
gene was inserted in the viral genome (Fig. 1A).
An armed virus (MV-PNP), an armed and targeted virus that
does not recognize its natural receptors (MV-PNP HblindantiCD20),
and a targeted virus expressing green fluorescent protein
(MVgreenHblindantiCD20) were engineered. The characteristics of
these viruses were confirmed by immunoblotting for PNP, or the
viral proteins H and N. A band corresponding to PNP with an
apparent molecular weight of 25 kDa was detected in cells infected
with MV-PNP or MV-PNP HblindantiCD20, respectively (Fig. 1B,
lanes 2 and 3). Reduced electrophoretic mobility of the hybrid H
glycoprotein was confirmed for the MV expressing HblindantiCD20
(Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). The N protein analysis confirmed
equivalent incorporation of these proteins in particles of the
standard and recombinant MV (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4).
We next assessed the specificity of the retargeted viruses to enter
human cell lines through different receptors. Cells expressing
various combinations of natural MV receptors, or of targeted
receptors, were infected at a MOI of 0.5 and monitored after 36 h for
the appearance of syncytia and/or enhanced green fluorescent

protein (EGFP) expression, reporting virus replication. As expected,
retargeted MV entered cells exclusively through CD20 or the Hisantibody pseudoreceptor (Fig. 1C, top row, second, fourth, and fifth
panels).
To assess specificity in an ex vivo approach, and to confirm
receptor expression, we used embryonic fibroblasts from transgenic CD46Ge mice that express CD46 with human-like tissue
specificity (36). These CD46-expressing cells were susceptible to
infection with MVgreen (Fig. 1D, right; syncytia formation and EGFP
expression) but not with MVgreenHblindantiCD20 (Fig. 1D, left), as
expected.
Dual prodrug function: early control of viral spread versus
late enhanced cell killing. We then assessed whether prodrugs
can be used to arrest viral spread in cells infected with MV-PNP
HblindantiCD20. When MeP-dR was added to medium 12 h after
infection at MOI 0.5, no syncytia were observed 36 h postinfection
(Fig. 2A, bottom left). On the other hand, cells infected with MVgreen
HblindantiCD20 showed characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE) with
widespread syncytia formation, even in the presence of prodrug
36 h postinfection (Fig. 2A, right). Administration of MeP-dR alone
up to a concentration of 100 Amol/L did not cause any CPE within
120 h (data not shown).
To document quantitatively the efficacy of prodrug in arresting
spread of the armed MV, we measured the infectious particles
produced by this virus and a control recombinant MV (MVgreen

HblindantiCD20) expressing EGFP in place of PNP. Production
of viral particles was quantified by titration on Vero-aHis cells
36 h postinfection (Fig. 2B). Growth of the control virus was
unchanged when MeP-dR was left out or added immediately after
infection (Fig. 2B, compare first and second columns, respectively),
indicating that the prodrug alone did not affect replication of a
virus not expressing PNP. Infection with MV-PNP HblindantiCD20
without prodrug addition resulted in similar titers (Fig. 2B, third
column), but when prodrug was added immediately after infection,
no infectious particles were produced (Fig. 2B, fourth column;
detection limit, 10 infectious units). Titers of this virus were
reduced f1,000 times when prodrug was added 12 or 24 h
postinfection (Fig. 2B, fifth and sixth columns, respectively),
suggesting that only secondary spread was completely inhibited.
This is consistent with lack of syncytia formation and MeP-dR
control of viral replication early during infection.
We also characterized the cytoreductive effects of different
prodrugs. A model lymphoma cell line (Raji) expressing CD20 was
infected with MV-PNP HblindantiCD20 at MOIs of 0.01, 0.1, and 1
(Fig. 2C). The prodrugs MeP-dR (left), or F-araAMP (center), or no
drug (right) were added to the medium ab initio and cell viability
was determined by MTT cell proliferation assay. Both prodrugs
enhanced the cytotoxic effect of MV-PNP HblindantiCD20 compared
with viral infection alone. Cytotoxicity enhancement was moderate
at early infection times, but very strong after virus multiplication,
accelerating complete cell lysis (Fig. 2C, red lines). As expected,
F-araAMP without concomitant virus infection was toxic for Raji
cells, but only after a long incubation time, whereas MeP-dR only
initially slowed cell replication. Altogether, these data suggest that
prodrug availability in the initial phases of infection results in
selective elimination of the infected cells, whereas extensive
prodrug toxification in later infection phases strongly accelerates
lysis of all cells.
Early prodrug administration protects mice from lethal
encephalitis. We then assessed in an animal system whether the
MV-PNP/prodrug system can be used as a fail-safe feature. Toward
this, we injected MV in the brain of IFN knockout mice expressing
human CD46 with human-like tissue specificity; MV administration
into the brain of these Ifnarko-CD46Ge mice causes fatal meningoencephalitis (36).
Mice were infected intracranially either with 5  105 PFU MVPNP, MV-PNP HblindantiCD20, or mock infected. One group
received 250 mg/kg/dose F-araAMP i.p. for 3 consecutive days
starting at 24 h after infection with MV-PNP. In a pilot experiment,
mice were sacrificed 5 days postinfection and sagittal brain
sections were characterized histologically (Fig. 3A). Section of
MV-PNP–infected brain (without prodrug administration) disclosed meningitis with inflammatory infiltrates of leukocytes
(Fig. 3A, top left, arrow). In contrast, infection with MV-PNP
HblindantiCD20, or mock infection, or infection with MV-PNP
followed by prodrug administration did not cause disease: The
meninges were thin and the parenchyma was intact.
We then assessed whether prodrug administration protected
mice from lethal encephalitis. Intracranial inoculation with MVPNP caused lethal encephalitis in six of six infected mice: Clinical
signs of neural diseases, including initial hyperactivity and
awkward gait, were followed by lethargy, lack of mobility, and
death 5 to 7 days after virus administration (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
infection with MV-PNP was well tolerated when F-araAMP was
administered i.p. for 3 consecutive days starting 24 h after viral
infection. Thus, if administered early after infection, F-araAMP

www.aacrjournals.org

controls viral infection even in the brain. Inoculation with 5  105
PFU of a CD46-detargeted MV (MV-PNP HblindantiCD20) did not
cause lethal infection, although certain animals infected with this
virus showed mild clinical symptoms (data not shown). Thus, in
this transgenic mouse model, MV replication was arrested by
F-araAMP administered early after infection, and MV detargeting
also eliminated viral spread and pathogenicity. Therefore, MV
vectors armed with a prodrug convertase are fail-safe, at least in
early infection phases, even in this very sensitive lethal encephalitis
model. Moreover, detargeting/retargeting is an alternative effective
way of enhancing vector safety.
Efficient oncolysis of Raji cell xenografts. Next, transgene
expression and oncolytic efficacy of the armed and retargeted MV
were characterized after s.c. implantation of Raji lymphoma
xenografts in SCID mice. This established model for treatment of
disseminated hematologic malignancies with MV (11) is not
responsive to F-araAMP.
First, efficiency of tumor xenograft transduction was measured
by quantitative RT-PCR after infection through different routes. On
average, 7.6  106 MV N mRNA copies per 105 cells (or 1 Ag total

extract/h): 118 F 66 PNP units were measured after i.t. injection
and f15 to 20 times lower levels after systemic administration of
MV-PNP HblindCD20 (Fig. 4B).
We then examined the effect on tumor growth of i.t. infection of
MV-PNP HblindCD20 with or without subsequent i.p. administration
of F-araAMP (Fig. 5A). Control groups were treated with mock or
prodrug only, respectively, and tumor diameters were measured

every 3 days. A strong oncolytic effect of the infection with MV-PNP
HblindCD20 alone was documented, which could be minimally
enhanced by prodrug administration. F-araAMP alone showed only
a marginal effect.
Survival benefits are illustrated using Kaplan-Meier estimate
with a 1,500 AL tumor volume defined end point (Fig. 5B).
Administration of MV-PNP HblindCD20 in the presence of prodrug
resulted in significant increase of survival compared with mock
therapy or administration of F-araAMP alone (P < 0.001 for both by
the two-sample t test). In this experimental approach, survival time
was slightly extended by treatment with PNP vector plus F-araAMP
compared with virus alone (two-sample t test P = 0.0343).

volume in i.t. treated mice was measured
every 3rd day. B, Kaplan-Meier survival

The defined end point was 1,500 AL tumor

were infected with MVgreenHblindantiCD20
at MOI of 0.5, and observed for EGFP
expression 48 h postinfection.

Because premature F-araAMP administration may interfere with
viral replication and oncolytic efficacy, we tested two delayed
application schedules. Four groups of 10 mice were treated with
MV-PNP HblindantiCD20 as described above, and F-araAMP was
administered either 1, or 8, or 15 days later. Thirty-five days after
the last viral treatment, 8 of 10 animals in the group treated with
prodrug at day 1 were alive, whereas only six and five mice survived
when prodrug was administered at days 8 and 15, respectively (data
not shown). Survival data were consistent with prodrug administration directly following the 5 days viral treatment being most
effective in this Raji lymphoma xenograft model.
Systemic administration of the armed and targeted MV
extends mouse survival. Because i.t. therapy is of limited value for
the treatment of disseminated malignancy, we tested the armed
and CD20-targeted MV in Raji cells xenografts after systemic
administration via tail vein (Fig. 5C). Here, treatment with solely
F-araAMP or virus alone did not have a statistically significant
effect compared with mock treatment (P > 0.05 from two-sample
t test), but the combination of MV-PNP HblindCD20 plus F-araAMP
had a therapeutic effect compared with mock treatment, F-araAMP,
and virus alone (P < 0.001 from two-sample t test), and was highly
synergistic (P = 0.0038; interaction test from two-factor ANOVA
model). The mean tumor volume at day 26 after implantation was
about half the mock-treated tumor volume (P < 0.001). This was
reflected in extended survival (Fig. 5D). Prolongation of survival
was significant only after combination of both prodrug and virus
(log-rank test P < 0.001) and showed synergistic effects (P = 0.0196;
interaction test from two-factor ANOVA model). Thus, systemic
administration was less efficient than i.t. treatment, allowing
documentation of synergistic effects of virus and prodrug.
Oncolytic efficacy was maintained in part after systemic
inoculation, even if PNP expression levels in tumors were 15 to

www.aacrjournals.org

20 times lower then after i.t. inoculation (Fig. 4B). A more
homogenous virus distribution in the tumor after systemic
inoculation may account for this enhanced effect: A homogenous
mixture of 0.1% PNP-expressing cells and 99.9% cells not expressing
PNP in a tumor elicited substantial antitumor effects (37).
Complete but temporary regression in a MCL tumor model.
We assessed oncolytic efficacy in a second model. We selected an
aggressive lymphoma model, Granta 519 cells (30, 38) implanted
these MCL xenografts, and administered virus and prodrug as in
the Raji cell xenograft model.
Twenty-five days after i.t. treatment with MV-PNP HblindantiCD20 alone, or combination therapy, all tumors of all the mice in
both groups (in total 20 tumors) became undetectable (Fig. 6A).
However, in a majority of the mice, tumors reappeared after a few
weeks. Survival after 40 days was 100%, and after 60 days was 60%
(Fig. 6B). In average, treated mice survived two to four times longer
than untreated mice. F-araAMP treatment alone led to marginal
tumor growth retardation and extended survival slightly. Administration of F-araAMP directly after i.t. viral treatment did not
enhance the oncolytic efficacy of the virus. Thus, in this aggressive
lymphoma model, virotherapy was highly effective.
Cells of MCL patients are permissive for infection. To assess
infection efficiency and to test the feasibility of viral transduction
in an ex vivo approach, peripheral blood cells from one MCL
patient were collected and infected with MVgreenHblindantiCD20.
Figure 6C shows a microscopic analysis of these cells: EGFP
expression, reporting virus transduction, was observed in large
groups of cells visualized within the even larger clumps forming in
this culture.
Surgical samples from the spleens of two other patients were
also inoculated with MVgreenHblindantiCD20. In these samples, 6%
and 1% infected cells were detected, respectively (data not shown;

because enhanced clumping resulting in exclusions from the FACS
analysis is a major issue with infected cell cultures, the percentiles
of infected cells may have been underestimated). As control,
another vector targeted to enter cells through the carcinoembryonic antigen was used. This virus did not infect these cells (data
not shown). Thus, primary cells of MCL lymphoma patients are
permissive for MV infection.

Discussion
We armed MV with a prodrug convertase activating the
approved lymphoma chemotherapeutic fludarabine, and retargeted
it to the B-cell specific antigen CD20. Therapeutic efficacy of this
vector, and synergy with F-araAMP after systemic administration,
were shown in a Burkitt’s lymphoma xenograft model. In a model
of MCL, i.t. virus treatment alone consistently caused tumor
regression, and supported 2- to 4-fold longer animal survival.
Adaptation of this prodrug/convertase system to MV also provides
a safety feature.
Combination treatments are well established in cancer therapy,
with the FCR regimen for selected low-grade NHL lymphoma being
a relevant example. The first approved oncolytic therapy regimen
combines an oncolytic adenovirus with chemotherapy (7). In
preclinical trials, oncolytic viruses have been combined with
established chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin, vincristine, or
doxorubicin (39). These dual-mode therapies resulted in additive or
synergistic effects compared with either therapy alone.
The rationale for these combination therapies has been the lack
of expected cross-resistance between the oncolytic virus and the
chemotherapeutic, rather than functional, reinforcement achieved
in our protocol when fludarabine is modified locally through the
production of highly diffusible 2-fluoroadenine (29). Our study
redefines the chemovirotherapy concept by introducing synergy in
the form of a targeted virus functioning locally as an amplifying
agent.
Preclinical data have already shown the efficacy of other
virotherapy approaches based on viral expression of prodrug
convertases. For example, a herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1
expressing cytochrome P450 oxidase augmented the effect of
cyclophosphamide (40). An adenovirus expressing uracil phosphoribosyltransferase enhanced the effect of 5-fluorouracil locally,
which was necessary to overcome chemoresistance to this drug
in the treatment of biliary tract cancer (41).
Prodrugs have also been used to control the replication of
another set of oncolytic viruses expressing convertases: For

example, GCV arrests replication of HSV or of adenoviruses
coding for HSV-tk (42, 43). Timing of prodrug application is
critical when the aim is termination of virus infection: In our
study, F-araAMP arrested spread of a MV-expressing PNP when
administered 24 h after a potentially lethal challenge, and
completely suppressed disease symptoms. These experiments
suggest that F-araAMP can be used in the clinic as a fail-safe
system to control the spread of MV-based oncolytic vectors, but
only in early infection phases.
Timing of prodrug application is also important when the aim is
therapeutic efficacy. Increasing the interval between infection and
prodrug administration in a chemovirotherapy approach improved
therapeutic efficacy of an armed adenovirus (41) because the virus
can spread further in the tumor before the prodrug is added to
enhance local cell killing. In our study, the most effective time point
for prodrug administration after MV-PNP HblindantiCD20 i.t.
treatment of Raji xenografts was immediately after the last virus
injection. Other tumor types and routes of virus administration
might require different schedules.
Ideally, the prodrug should be administered when replication is
at its peak; however, it has not been possible to monitor viral
replication in patients. The development of recombinant MV that
express plasma proteins reporting replication (44) allows noninvasive monitoring of MV infection in clinical trials.5 Thus, planning of
accurate prodrug administration schedules is now possible based
on these tracking tools.
In summary, our experiments indicate that a PNP-armed and
CD20-targeted MV can synergize with fludarabine in lymphoma
therapy. This vector has the potential to substitute Rituximab in an
improved FCR therapeutic regimen, or to be combined only with
fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, the other two components of the
regimen. Cyclophosphamide immunosuppression enhances MV
oncolytic efficacy in an immunocompetent host (45), as it does
with oncolytic reoviruses, HSVs, and adenoviruses (46–48). Toward
clinical trials, more data on timing of vector application in
combination with these two drugs are currently sought.
