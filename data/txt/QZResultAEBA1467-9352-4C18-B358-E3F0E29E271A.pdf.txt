BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of inflammation, has been reported to be a poor prognostic indicator in prostate cancer. Here we explore the use of the NLR to establish a simple prognostic score for men with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with docetaxel. METHODS: In the training cohort, the NLR and other known
prognostic variables were evaluated among a cohort of chemotherapy-na€ıve patients treated with thrice-weekly docetaxel at the
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Significant prognostic variables identified by univariable Cox regression were evaluated by the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Multivariable Cox regression was then used to derive a prognostic score where 1
risk point was assigned for each significant variable. The model was externally validated in a cohort of patients treated at the Royal
Marsden. RESULTS: Three hudred fifty-seven patients were analyzed in the training cohort. Median age was 71 years, 12% had liver metastasis, and median overall survival (OS) was 14.7 months. Liver metastases, hemoglobin <12 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase >2.03
upper limit of normal (ULN), lactate dehydrogenase >1.23 ULN, and NLR >3 were associated with significantly worse OS in multivariable analysis. Four risk categories were subsequently established with 0, 1, 2, and 3-5 points. Two-year OS rates for these categories
were 43%, 37%, 12%, and 3%, respectively. Area under the curve for the training cohort was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72-0.84) compared with
0.66 (95% CI, 0.58-0.74) for the 215 patients in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This simple risk score provides good prognostic

INTRODUCTION
Clinicians use prognostic models and nomograms to inform patients and to aid in making treatment decisions. In prostate
cancer, prognostic models have been developed for use in management of men with all stages of prostate cancer, from
localized disease to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).1,2
Commonly used prognostic models and nomograms for men with mCRPC have been derived from patients treated
in clinical studies.2-6 Compared with simple prognostic scores, nomograms can be more cumbersome to use in daily practice because of the longer time needed for data entry.
Inflammation is recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer.7 The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be
derived easily from the differential blood count and is a marker of host inflammation. The NLR has been demonstrated to
have prognostic value in many solid tumors including mCRPC.8-10 Here we aimed to establish a simple prognostic score
for men with mCRPC who were to be treated with docetaxel. We explored the incorporation of the NLR, hypothesizing
that this would add prognostic information and improve accuracy.

Prognostic Score With NLR in CRPC/Templeton et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Criteria for reporting recommendations for tumor
markers in prognostic studies (REMARK) were followed
wherever possible.11
Study Populations

Sequential men who received at least 1 dose of docetaxel
once every 3 weeks for mCRPC between February 2001
and November 2011 at Princess Margaret Cancer Center
(PM) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada were reviewed, and
their data served as a training cohort to build a prognostic
score. The institutional Research Ethics Board approved
the study. The validation cohort consisted of patients
treated with docetaxel between April 2004 and November
2012 at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (RM)
in Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom. These patients provided written informed consent to collect data on institutional research board–approved protocols.
Data Collection

Patients at PM were identified through pharmacy records
that listed all patients who had received docetaxel. For
patients treated before 2005, the indication for such treatment was not available, and data from the PM Registry
were used to define the diagnosis. Patients who received
docetaxel for indications other than prostate cancer were
excluded, as were men who received weekly treatment
(usually because such patients were frail or had significant
comorbidities), docetaxel as second-line chemotherapy,
or docetaxel for early prostate cancer, that is, in the context of neoadjuvant or adjuvant trials. Clinical data were
extracted manually from the electronic patient record
(EPR). Laboratory values were obtained electronically
from the EPR, and baseline was defined as any measurement occurring up to 28 days before the first dose of docetaxel. Dates of primary diagnosis and death were obtained
from the PM Registry, which includes 99% of patients
treated in the institution. Data from all sources were
linked using the patient’s medical record number.
At RM, patients were identified from clinical trial
and research databases as having received docetaxel once
every 3 weeks for mCRPC. Laboratory and clinical data
were collected manually from EPRs.
Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics for categorical variables were
reported as frequencies and percentages, and continuous
variables were reported as medians and ranges. Categorical variables of both cohorts were compared using Fisher’s
exact test and the Kruskal-Wallis test for 2 and more than
Cancer

2 variables, respectively. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Survival was calculated from the date of first docetaxel administration to
death, with censoring at date of last contact for patients
alive at the cutoff date. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to calculate survival estimates, and survival curves
were compared using the log rank test. The association of
individual variables with survival was assessed using the
Cox proportional hazards model. Variables of interest
included age at start of treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), site of metastatic spread, Gleason score (< 8 vs 8-10), serum levels of
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA doubling time (PSAdt), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), hemoglobin, albumin, and NLR (the ratio of the
absolute blood neutrophil count divided by the absolute
blood lymphocyte count). Laboratory values were treated
as continuous variables. Variables with nonnormal distribution (eg PSA, LDH, and ALP) were log-transformed.
The method for selection of variables and their cutoffs was defined prospectively. All continuous variables
with a P < .05 in univariable Cox proportional hazards
analysis were dichotomized using different cutoffs, with at
least 5% of patients falling into each category. Subsequent
variable reduction was conducted by assessing discriminatory accuracy (the balance between sensitivity and specificity) for each cutoff using the area under the receiver
operator characteristics (ROC) curves (c-statistic). The
cutoff with the highest c-statistic was selected for further
evaluation. ROC curves and associated c-statistics were
calculated based on an outcome of death by 15 months,
the median survival in the training cohort. Variables
whose cutoffs established 2 groups of men showing the
highest hazard ratio (HR) between them and the highest
c-statistic (ie, the largest area under the ROC curves,
thereby indicating maximal discrimination) were selected
for further analysis. Multivariable Cox regression with
forward stepwise selection was used for primary analysis,
and backward stepwise selection was performed as a confirmatory analysis. In situations in which the cutoff with
the highest HR was not the same as the cutoff with the
highest c-statistic, both cutoffs were chosen for separate
multivariable models. Each multivariable model was then
compared by its c-statistic, and the model with the highest
c-statistic was selected to establish the prognostic score.
The final prognostic score assigned one risk point for each
variable with a P < .05 in the final multivariable Cox
regression model, and the risk points were used to establish 4 prognostic groups. This final score was then tested
in the validation cohort. The final model was also

The training and validation cohorts consisted of 357 and
215 patients, respectively. Patient and tumor characteristics of each cohort are presented in Table 1. Compared
with men in the validation cohort, men in the training
cohort were older (median age, 71 vs 67 years; P < .001),
tended to have a worse ECOG PS (P 5 .052), had more
visceral disease, and had higher median LDH, and a
higher proportion had hypoalbuminemia. A greater proportion of men in the validation cohort were treated in
clinical trials, more received abiraterone acetate, and the
median overall survival of the validation cohort was longer
(median, 20 vs 15 months; P < .001).

compared with the established Halabi nomogram, which
included the presence of visceral disease, Gleason score,
performance status, PSA, LDH, ALP, and hemoglobin.2
All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 20 (IBM
Corp., Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were 2 sided, and
statistical significance was defined as P < .05. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons.

In univariable analysis higher ECOG PS, presence of liver
metastases, lower levels of hemoglobin and albumin, and
higher PSA, LDH, ALP, and NLR at baseline were associated with shorter survival of the training cohort (Table 2).
For ECOG PS, hemoglobin, ALP, PSA, and NLR,
the cutoffs giving the highest HR between groups did not
have the numerically highest c-statistic, and thus both cutoffs (ie, the one with the highest HR and the one with the
highest c-statistic based on ROC curves) were taken forward. A total of 16 multivariable analyses were carried out
and c-statistics calculated for every model after assignment
of 1 risk point per significant variable. C-statistics ranged
from 0.78 to 0.80. The highest c-statistic (0.80) was seen
when liver metastasis, hemoglobin <120 g/L, ALP
>2.03 upper limit of normal (ULN), LDH >1.23
ULN, and NLR >3.0 were included in the model (Table
2). For the final model, variables and effect sizes were similar to those obtained from multivariable analysis using
backward elimination of least significant factors. Exclusion of NLR >3 from multivariable analysis or replacing
NLR >3 by cutoffs for neutrophils or lymphocytes (or
both) resulted in models with lower c-statistics. Excluding
the NLR from the final model resulted in a c-statistic of
0.77.
Four groups, with 0, 1, 2, and 3-5 unfavorable prognostic factors, were created for a total of 335 patients

Example on how to calculate score: 68-year-old man with bone and lymph node metastases from mCRPC about to start treatment with docetaxel. Baseline
hemoglobin 138 g/L, alkaline phosphatase 420 U/L (normal range, <150 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase 178 U/L (normal range, <220 U/L), absolute neutrophil
count 6.7 g/L, absolute lymphocyte count 1.8 g/L. This patient has 2 risk points (alkaline phosphatase >2 times upper limit of normal, and NLR >3 [6.7 divided
by 1.8 5 3.72]) and thus falls in the intermediate-risk group.

(94% of the sample, the remaining 6% having missing
data preventing assessment of all variables). Outcomes for
these groups are given in Table 3; an example on how to
calculate the score is given in the footnote of Table 3. Survival was shorter with more unfavorable prognostic factors
(Fig. 1A), and the c-statistic was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74-0.84;
Fig. 2). Using death by months 24 and 36 as outcomes,
c-statistics were 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. This compared
favorably with the c-statistics calculated with the total

points derived from the Halabi score,2 which were 0.72,
0.74, and 0.70 for the outcomes of death by months 15,
24, and 36, respectively (Fig. 2).
Validation

The final score could be calculated for 210 patients from
the validation cohort (98%) and showed good separation
of the survival curves (Fig. 1B) and fairly good discriminatory accuracy (c-statistic, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.73).

Outcomes for the 3 risk groups are given in Table 3.
Using death by months 24 and 36 as outcomes resulted in
c-statistics of 0.67 and 0.72, respectively (Fig. 2), which
were lower than for the Halabi model in prediction of
early mortality. Excluding patients who received abiraterone prior to docetaxel resulted in a c-statistic of 0.68.
The variables included in the final score showed significant association with overall survival (OS) in the validation cohort in univariable analysis and except for
albumin < 40 g/L were also significant in the multivariable model (Table S2).
DISCUSSION
We present a simple risk score for men with mCRPC that
provided good prognostic and discriminatory accuracy in
3350

both training and validation cohorts. Using the presence
of liver metastases, the biochemical variables ALP and
LDH, and hematologic variables hemoglobin and NLR, 4
risk categories were identified. The 2-year OS ranged
from 43%, for a score of 0, to 3%, for a score of 3-5. Good
discriminatory ability was demonstrated, with a c-statistic
in the training and validation cohorts of 0.78 and 0.66,
respectively. Given the prognostic role of the NLR in prostate cancer, this readily available biomarker may also be
used to stratify patients in randomized clinical trials.
The main strengths of this study included the prospective definition of the process of variable selection, the
ease of use of dichotomous variables, the external validation of the findings in an independent data set, and the
hypothesis-driven incorporation of the NLR. However,
our score appeared to be a less accurate predictor of early
mortality than the Halabi nomogram. Despite this, an
advantage over the Halabi tool is that our score is easier to
use and does not require use of complex computergenerated algorithms. Our model also performed well
when different outcome states were selected.
Of note, the validation cohort in our study comprised a markedly different population of patients than
the training cohort, consisting largely of men recruited to
clinical trials and with better prognostic features. Patients
in the validation cohort had a lower prevalence of liver
metastasis and better median overall survival, and more
were treated with abiraterone than in the training cohort.
Despite these differences, the risk score performed fairly
well in the validation cohort, and the c-statistic improved

Prognostic Score With NLR in CRPC/Templeton et al

after exclusion of patients treated with abiraterone before
docetaxel.
The prognostic role of the NLR has been shown in
more than 60 studies for many solid tumors, including
prostate cancer.8,9,12,13 In 135 men with mCRPC receiving ketoconazole, NLR >3 was associated with poorer
progression-free survival,14 and we have shown a role of
the NLR in predicting response to abiraterone.15 The
mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly
understood but likely reflect more aggressive behavior in
tumors with greater inflammation. This hypothesis is supported by data with C-reactive protein, a well-recognized
marker of inflammation, which has also been shown to be
prognostic in several solid tumors.16 In recent years,
numerous prognostic markers have been proposed for
prostate cancer. These include serum androgens.17 serum
biomarkers based on quantitative analysis of the phosphatase and tensin homolog conditional knockout mouse
proteome,18 serum biomarkers of bone metabolism,19
molecular markers in key steroidogenic pathways,20 and
circulating tumors cells.21 The utility of inflammationbased markers in prostate cancer also appears valid in this
setting.
This study has limitations. First, it was a retrospective cohort study with manual extraction of clinical data.
This may have led to inaccurate assessment of PS (often
not mentioned explicitly and therefore coded as missing)
and nonavailability of relevant data (eg, Gleason scores).
Furthermore, because of its retrospective nature, this
study will have lower internal validity than data from clinical trials, as there will be more uncertainty regarding
dates of outcomes of interest and more heterogeneity
regarding measurement of variables of interest. Other limitations include differences between the patients in the
training and validation cohorts, including that the
patients in the training cohort were not exposed to newly
approved agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T,
radium-223, or cabazitaxel), and our inability to evaluate
all reported prognostic factors including the presence of
pain at baseline (pain was not recorded systematically, and
therefore we were unable to collect this information), type
of progression,4 and circulating tumor cell counts.21 We
also selected dichotomized cutoff points, although this
was done systematically to optimize discrimination.
Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are nonspecific
parameters that are influenced by concurrent infections,
inflammation, and corticosteroid medication, which we
could not account for. Inflammation and specifically an
elevated NLR have been demonstrated to predict mortality in cardiovascular diseases including acute coronary
Cancer

November 1, 2014

syndromes, which are relevant conditions in our patient
population.22 In contrast, patients on concurrent corticosteroids such as prednisone may have had an artificially
high NLR.
In summary, we derived a simple prognostic score
for men with mCRPC before the start of treatment with
docetaxel once every 3 weeks. We demonstrated the
improved prognostic information obtained by adding the
NLR to known clinical and laboratory prognostic factors.2-4 The NLR is a promising, readily available, and
inexpensive biomarker that adds prognostic information
to current risk scores. This prognostic score should be further explored in other groups of men with mCRPC
including those starting initial chemotherapy and those
receiving other second-line agents of proven value including cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, and radium-223.23-25
