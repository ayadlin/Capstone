Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Tumor Bioluminescence
Implicates Efflux, and Not Influx, as the Bigger Hurdle in
Cancer Drug Therapy

Abstract
In vivo bioluminescence imaging is a powerful tool for assessing tumor burden and quantifying therapeutic
response in xenograft models. However, this technique exhibits significant variability as a consequence of
differences in substrate administration, as well as the tumor size, type, and location. Here, we present a novel
pharmacokinetic (PK) approach that utilizes bioluminescence image data. The sample data are taken from mice
implanted with a melanoma tumor cell line that was transfected to express the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase
gene. At 5, 7, and 10 days postimplant, intraperitoneal injections of D-luciferin were given to monitor the uptake
into the tumor, and the tumor volume was measured using ultrasound. A multicompartment PK model was used
to simultaneously fit all experiments for each mouse. We observed that the rates of luciferin transport in and out of
the tumor exhibited a clear dependence on the tumor volume. Also, the rate of tumor influx increased faster than
did the efflux, resulting in a shortening of the time to peak-luciferin concentration as the tumor grows. The time of
the peak concentration correlated poorly with the tumor volume, but the peak bioluminescence signal and the
area under the curve both exhibited a dependence on the tumor surface area. These results agree with Starling's
hypothesis relating the higher interstitial fluid pressure in the tumor with flux across the boundary, and suggest
that drug transport may depend more strongly on the surface area of the tumor than its volume. These
observations provide a quantitative physical rationale for molecular targeting of therapeutics that enhance
trapping and overcome the accelerated efflux kinetics. Cancer Res; 71(3); 686–92. 2010 AACR.

Major Findings
By combining detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling
with bioluminescence imaging, quantitative assessments of
the relationship between tumor growth and drug uptake
kinetics are possible. Much of the variability that arises from
standard bioluminescence measurements is accounted for
in this PK model, and the net result is a clear scaling
relationship between drug transport kinetics, drug levels
within the tumor, and the tumor volume. These results
illustrate how bioluminescence imaging of xenograft models, particularly in longitudinal studies of tumor load or
therapy intervention, could benefit from the addition of PK
modeling utilizing image-based readouts for individualized
metrics of drug delivery and efficacy.

Introduction
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a powerful, noninvasive
tool for localizing tumors, quantifying their growth properties, and monitoring the effects of therapy (1–8). The use of
tumor cells expressing luciferase from firefly or other species
have been of particular utility as they provide a very sensitive
signal with a short acquisition time that can be adapted for
high-throughput techniques. The substrate, D-luciferin, is
administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) or i.v. injection, and
is oxidized by the endogenous luciferase when it reaches the
tumor cell, resulting in photon emission.
Although there are clear advantages for tumor characterization with this technique, several challenges and
drawbacks exist. First, the time course of light emission
exhibits significant variability depending on the size and
location of the tumor, as well as the tumor cell line used in
the xenograft (1, 4, 5, 9, 10). Furthermore, the method of
luciferin administration (e.g., i.p. vs. i.v.), can affect both
the sensitivity and reproducibility of the results (4). Finally,
although many previous studies present analyses of the
bioluminescent signal suggesting that tumor volume is
correlated to the peak signal or the area under the curve
(AUC), some studies have found the BLI signal to be
roughly linear with volume (5, 11) whereas others have
found relationships that are sublinear or nonlinear in
nature (1, 2, 4).

These equations describe the mass balance of luciferin in peritoneum Lip, blood Lb, and tumor Lt. The first equation
describes the intraperitoneal (IP) delivery where ka is the first-order rate constant describing the absorption of luciferin from
the peritoneum into the blood. The second equation describes the change in luciferin levels in the blood with 4 separate
components: kbtLb describes passage from the blood to the tumor, ktbLt is reverse transfer from the tumor back to the blood,
kaLip describes adsorption from the peritoneum, and kelLb is the rate of elimination from the body. The rate constants vary
between individual mice and may also change as the tumor grows.

Major Assumptions of the Model
1) This model ignores the specific contributions of other tissues in the body; however, a 3-compartment model results in the
nearly identical parameter values, thus this simplification is justified.
dP
¼ Vo Lt
dt
This equation describes the rate of photon emission from the tumor. The reaction of luciferin with the luciferase expressed by
the tumor cells should follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics because it is enzyme mediated; however, we are in a regime in which the
substrate concentration (luciferin) is much less than the measured Km value for luciferin-luciferase, so this linear approximation
is valid (see text for more details). V0 is the conversion factor that relates the photon emission rate to the level of luciferin.
2) As each cell expresses luciferase, we assume that the concentration of luciferase in a growing tumor remains constant over
the duration of experiment.

Here, we present a quantitative analysis of D-luciferin pharmacokinetics in a series of bioluminescence studies of luciferase-expressing tumors in mice. With the use of a 2-compartment
PK model, we can accurately describe and replicate the biodistribution of luciferin as well as the growth kinetics of the tumor.
Further, this method captures the intrinsic variability present in
i.p. delivery, and through application of a novel simultaneous
fitting algorithm, we arrive at a more accurate set of PK
parameters than could be achieved through more conventional
solutions to PK modeling. Our method shows a clear scaling
relationship between the bioluminescent signal and the tumor
volume. Furthermore, unanticipated and surprising insights
into tumor transport kinetics emerge from the quantitative
analysis suggesting that accelerated efflux rather than reduced
influx could be a limiting factor for drug therapy in these types of
experimental models, offering a physical rationale for molecular
targeting in tumor therapy.

Materials and Methods
Experimental details
Albino female mice [B6(CG)-TYRC-2J/J] on a B6 background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room under a
12-hour light/dark cycle with regular mouse chow and water

ad libitum. The care and treatment of animals in this study
follows protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee
at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Mice (n ¼ 6) were
s.c. implanted with 1  106 B16F10-luc cells (12) in the
inguinal region. These cells were obtained from and authenticated by American Type Culture Collection and were transfected to express luciferase with the pGL3 vector from
Promega. All cells were in culture for less than 6 months.
On days 5, 7, and 10 postimplantation, the animals were
imaged every 5 minutes for 60 minutes with an IVIS Spectrum
(Caliper Life Sciences) after i.p. injection of 150 mg/kg Dluciferin in sterile saline (Fig. 1). To prepare for imaging, the
fur in the tumor region was removed by shaving followed with
surgical depilatory cream. Data were analyzed offline with
Living Image Software v3.1 (Caliper Life Science) by drawing
regions of interest (ROI) around the tumor masses to derive
total photon flux, which is the radiance in each pixel summed
or integrated over the ROI area (cm2)  4p giving units of
photons/sec. Mice 5 and 6 were sacrificed on day 7 and mice
1–4 at the termination of the experiment in order to excise,
measure, and weigh the tumors and thereby confirm our
ultrasound measurements.
For tumor volume determination, a Vevo 660 ultrasound
system (VisualSonics Inc.) with an RMV-703 35 MHz probe
was used to image the animals. The Vevo 660 was modified to

output analog radiofrequency (RF) signals, which were digitized using a Gage CS 12400 12-bit digitizer at 200 megasamples/s. These data were used to compute the
backscattered energy along each RF line, which was converted
to grayscale values for display. The probe was affixed to a
gantry, which was translated across the tumor in 100-mm
steps. In this way, a sequence of frames was acquired over the
entire tumor, permitting the complete tumor volume to be
reconstructed from the backscattered RF data. Image formation and analysis was done using open source software
(ImageJ; W.S. Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, MD). ROIs were drawn
around the tumor cross-sections for each imaging plane, and
the scaled tumor volume was computed by multiplying each
ROI area by the scan step size (100 mm) and summing these
values for all planes in the scan.
To test if the placement and orientation of the mice would
affect the BLI signal as suggested in (9), 5 animals were
implanted with the same tumor cell line as in the initial

experiments. On day 10, the mice were all placed in the
imaging chamber and injected with D-luciferin. Gauze wedges
were fashioned to alter the position of the 2 animals on the
outer left (m1) and outer right side (m5) of the group (see
Supplementary Fig. S3). The gauze tilted animal 1 to left
slightly and tilted animal 5 to the right slightly. Images were
taken every 5 minutes after injection of the substrate, first with
the gauze in place, then with the gauze removed. The elapsed
time to reposition animals between the 2 image acquisitions
was approximately 1 minute.
Pharmacokinetic model
We developed a 2-compartment open PK model as shown
in Fig. 2. To capture the nature of IP delivery, we included
a first-order kinetic term describing transit into the blood
stream from the peritoneum [the kaLip term in Equation (A)].
We also included the luciferin-luciferase reaction kinetics
because the rate of reaction corresponds directly to the

Luciferin is administered via i.p. injection and passes into the bloodstream
with first-order kinetics (ka). Once in the bloodstream, luciferin can move
into the tumor (rate constant kbt) or be eliminated from the body (rate
constant kel). In the tumor, luciferin is passed back into the bloodstream

resulting in photon emission.

bioluminescence signal that we measure. This reaction should
follow standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics; however, the
experiment is conducted in the low substrate concentration
limit, [S] << Km, allowing us to adopt the simpler, linear form
shown in Equation (B). All other rate constants, kbt, ktb, and kel,
describe standard first-order reactions.
Parameter fitting
To determine the PK parameters for each mouse/experiment, we used the simultaneous fitting procedure implemen-

ted within the public domain program NanoPK that was
developed in our laboratory (13). We found little variability
in the elimination rate (kel) and fixed this parameter for each
individual mouse. However, kip was made variable to reflect
the subtle differences in each i.p. injection, and kbt and ktb
were allowed to change because the biodistribution clearly is
altered as the tumor grows. The BLI curves for days 5, 7, and 10
were then simultaneously fit for each individual mouse using a
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique based on the
least squares fit between the model prediction and the BLI
data. The relative light unit (V0) in equation (B) was set at the
same value (9.07  1014) for all data. The PSO method is ideal
for searches in high-dimensional spaces, and we carried out
100 independent searches to ensure that we had found the
optimal parameter set. The sum of square residuals (SSR)
between the model solutions and the BLI curves was used as
the "cost function" for the search. The top parameter set (i.e.,
the solution with the smallest SSR) was used as a starting
point for another 100 PSO runs and the PK parameters from
these 100 solutions were averaged to come up with the
parameters in Table 1. The AUC for 60 minutes (AUC0–60)
and bioluminescence at peak (BLpeak) were obtained from the
time profile after parameterization. The scaling relationships
with tumor volume shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding P
values were determined using nonlinear regression in R (14).
Details on parameter sensitivity are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1.

Results and Discussion
BLI results
On days 5, 7, and 10 following tumor implantation, BLI data

a sample BLI acquired on day 7 with the IVIS Spectrum.
Analysis of the data shows the total tumor signal increased, as
expected, and the time to peak signal decreased as days
postimplantation increased. Ultrasound imaging of the animals also showed an increase in tumor volume over the course
of the experiment.
Fitting the BLI data
The BLI data for luciferin levels in the tumors were fit for
each individual mouse using our 2-compartment PK model
(Fig. 2). The resulting set of PK parameters is listed in Table 1
and the corresponding fits are shown along with the raw data
in Figure 3. The overall fit between the experimental data and
the model predictions, as measured by the sum of square
residuals, is excellent and the parameter values are consistent
between the individual experiments. One of the challenges
noted in previous studies of this type has been the inherent
variability of luciferin transit into the blood stream after i.p.
injection (4, 5). In our studies we do observe values for ka that
range from 0.02–0.34/min and this does highlight the difficulties with exact reproducibility. Lower rates of transit result
in a longer time-to-peak value, but this variability is not an
issue here given that our PK treatment models the full system
and therefore naturally adapts and compensates for these
changes in administration. The elimination rate, kel, exhibited
much less variability from mouse to mouse, and because it
seemed to be independent of the tumor volume, we used the
same value in all experiments for a given mouse. Conversely,
the parameters for luciferin transfer between the blood and
tumor (kbt and ktb) were allowed to vary for each experiment
because they manifested a significant dependence on tumor
volume.

mice measured on days 5, 7, and

Note that the scale for the vertical
axes changes for each graph, and
the units are in 108 photons/s. The
D-luciferin dose was 150 mg/kg in
each case, administered via i.p.
injection. The lines represent the
best-fit curves resulting from our
PK modeling.

PK dependence on tumor volume
The size of the tumor was measured by ultrasound on days
5, 7, and 10 following implant of the xenograft. From fitting
these data, we confirmed that the tumors exhibited an exponential growth with a doubling time of 1.28 days. The rate of
distribution of luciferin between blood and tumor was clearly
dependent on tumor size. We hypothesize that as the tumor
grows, its blood supply and flow will increase resulting in the
larger kbt value that we register. However, the efflux from
tumor back into blood pool, ktb, increases at the same time.
Figure 4A shows how kbt and ktb correlate with the measured
tumor volume. As one might naïvely expect based on simple
mass balance, kbt increases roughly linearly with the tumor
volume (kbt  V1.08), but the increase of ktb is somewhat slower
(ktb  V0.5). The tumor volume increases more than 100-fold
over the course of the experiment and both parameters show
linear behavior over this range. Histology of our tumors
excised at day 10 shows healthy tumors without any signs
of necrosis or hypoxia (see Supplementary Fig. S2); however,
we might anticipate in longer-term experiments that the
scaling relationships could change if the viable portion of
the tumor undergoes necrosis in response to drug therapy or
growth itself.
Transport into the tumor
Apart from differences in luciferin administration, it has
been established that the level of the bioluminescence peak
correlates with tumor burden (1–5, 11, 15). However, the
exact dependence of this relationship has never been clearly
defined. To test this in our model, we calculated both the
peak-luciferin level (BLpeak) as well as the AUC over the 60
minutes following luciferin administration (AUC0–60). Figure

the tumor volume revealing similar behavior in both quantities: AUC0–60  V 0.65 and BLpeak  V 0.68.
It has long been postulated that the high interstitial fluid
pressure within a tumor acts as a barrier to transcapillary
transport and thus renders drug delivery into the tumor
difficult (16). Starling's hypothesis states that the fluid flux J
across a permeable boundary is given by J ¼ Lp  S  DP ,
where Lp is the hydraulic conductivity of the boundary, S is the
surface area and DP is the pressure difference across the
boundary (17). The bioluminescence levels that we observe

www.aacrjournals.org

in the tumor could be considered a surrogate for any transportable drug, as measured by either BLpeak or AUC0–60. Both
of these quantities increase roughly as V2/3, and this scaling is
intriguing because if we imagine a spherical tumor of volume
V, the surface area S of the tumor would also increase as V2/3,
in agreement with Starling's hypothesis. Interestingly, we
observe a very similar behavior if we go back and take the
ratio of our PK rate constants kbt and ktb. In this case we again
see that the equilibrium partitioning between the blood and
tumor would increase as kbt =ktb  V 1:08 =V 0:5 ¼ V 0:58 or
approximately the 2/3 power of the volume. This is consistent

with our other measurements, and it also illustrates how we
might improve upon simple passive delivery. Because the
influx into the tumor increases linearly with volume, transporting compounds into the tumor does not seem to be an
issue; however, efflux now is also greater with larger tumor
sizes and eventually becomes the determining factor in the
drug biodistribution. This scenario confirms the anticipated
utility of molecular targeting whereby we might significantly
increase drug levels in the tumor by decreasing the efflux
through compound trapping or active targeting.
Variability in BLI measurements
Despite offering a powerful tool for diagnosis and monitoring, BLI manifests significant intrinsic variability as one of its
primary limitations (9, 10). Differences in the BLI signal
naturally arise from changes in the type or location of the
tumor (9, 10), the size of the tumor (5), and the method and
regimen of luciferin administration (4, 5). Signal differences
could also be possible as a result of how the animal is
positioned on the stage (9), although we found that tilting
the mice produced a very minor change in the BLI level
and the resulting PK parameters (Supplementary Fig. S3).
All of these variable elements make it difficult to provide
quantitative assessments based on single measurements, but

these factors are easily and properly dealt with in a comprehensive PK model. By considering all aspects of the luciferin
(or drug) dynamics (administration, absorption, biodistribution, reaction, and clearance), more quantitative and comprehensive modeling of drug levels and tumor transport
kinetics is possible, and this could facilitate individualized
therapeutics with the use of image-based metrics of pharmacodynamics and PKs.
