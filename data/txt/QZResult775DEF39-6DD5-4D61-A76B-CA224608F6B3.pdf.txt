Abstract
Relapse of prostate cancer after androgen ablation therapy is
hormone-refractory, with continued tumor growth being
dependent on the androgen receptor (AR). E2F-1, a regulator
of cell proliferation and viability, reportedly plays a role in the
development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Thymoquinone is a component of Nigella sativa, an herb used for
thousands of years for culinary and medicinal purposes in Asian
and Middle Eastern countries and has been reported to have
an antineoplastic effect both in vitro and in vivo. We observed
that thymoquinone inhibited DNA synthesis, proliferation,
and viability of cancerous (LNCaP, C4-B, DU145, and PC-3) but
not noncancerous (BPH-1) prostate epithelial cells by downregulating AR and E2F-1. In LNCaP cells, this was associated
with a dramatic increase in p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and Bax. Thymoquinone blunted progression of synchronized LNCaP cells from
G1 to S phase, with a concomitant decrease in AR and E2F-1 as
well as the E2F-1-regulated proteins necessary for cell cycle
progression. In a xenograft prostate tumor model, thymoquinone inhibited growth of C4-2B–derived tumors in nude mice.
This in vivo suppression of tumor growth, as with C4-2B cell
growth in culture, was associated with a dramatic decrease
in AR, E2F-1, and cyclin A as determined by Western blot of
tissue extracts. Tissue immunohistochemical staining confirmed a marked reduction in E2F-1 and showed induction of
apoptosis on terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. These findings show that
thymoquinone suppresses the expression of AR and E2F-1
necessary for proliferation and viability of androgen-sensitive
as well as androgen-independent prostate cancer cells both
in vitro and in vivo and, moreover, produced no noticeable
side effects in mice. We conclude that thymoquinone, a
naturally occurring herbal product, may prove to be effective
in treating hormone-sensitive as well as hormone-refractory
prostate cancer. Furthermore, because of its selective effect
on cancer cells, we believe that thymoquinone can also be
used safely to help prevent the development of prostate
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7782–8]

27,050 deaths in the United States during 2007 (1). Whereas stateof-the-art treatment of prostate cancer provides prolonged diseasefree survival for many patients with localized disease, it is rarely
curative in patients with locally advanced or metastatic hormonerefractory disease. Androgen ablation therapy is the mainstream
strategy for treatment of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer;
however, hormonal therapy leads to remissions typically lasting
2 to 3 years, whereas in most men, metastatic prostate cancer
eventually progresses to an androgen-independent state resulting
in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, for which there is presently
no known effective treatment (2, 3). Androgen receptor (AR) is
expressed in nearly all prostate cancers (4–6), and growth of
hormone-refractory disease continues to depend on AR that is
either overexpressed or activated promiscuously (7). Therefore,
developing a curative strategy should involve finding effective ways
of not just inactivating AR but eliminating it altogether from
cancer cells (8).
E2F-1 is an essential transcription factor required for expression
of a number of proteins involved in G1-S transition and DNA
synthesis (9). Tight regulation of E2F-1 is critical for cell
proliferation and viability (10). E2F-1 seems to be an oncogene at
lower levels and induces apoptosis at higher levels (11, 12). Because
of its ability to repress AR transcription, elevated levels of E2F-1
may contribute to the progression of hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (13). Many human cancers involve pRb mutations that
result in E2F-1 activation (14). Disruption of the pRb-E2F-1
complex may predispose the prostatic epithelium to hormonal
carcinogenesis (15) and lead to the development of hormonerefractory prostate tumors (16). Therefore, targeting E2F-1 could be
a viable and effective means of treating prostate cancer.
Furthermore, because prostate cancer is predominantly a tumor
of older men, who frequently have coexisting medical illnesses
that usually limit treatment options, and because androgen
deprivation therapy can cause osteoporosis and bone fractures
(17), it is important to focus on agents that lack the toxic side
effects of currently used therapies.
Herbal remedies have been used for thousands of years with very
minimal side effects and clearly merit extended research for their
ability to selectively kill prostate cancer cells. Several herbal
products have recently been incorporated into cancer research
(18–21), among them is Nigella sativa whose seeds have been used
medicinally for centuries in a variety of diseases (22). Extracts
prepared from N. sativa seeds, called black seeds, reportedly exhibit
significant in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic activity (22–24).
Chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects of black seed
extracts are attributed to quinines, mainly thymoquinone, which is
present in the volatile oil of the seed (25) and reportedly induces
antitumor effects in a variety of cancer cell lines (26, 27). However,
despite knowledge of these potential antineoplastic effects, the
molecular pathways involved are not clear, and the potential

Thymoquinone as a Therapeutic Agent for Prostate Cancer

benefits of thymoquinone for treatment and/or prevention of
prostate cancer have received very little attention (28).
We investigated the molecular events involved in the antineoplastic effects of thymoquinone in prostate cancer cells. We
observed a dose-dependent increase in the inhibitory effect of
thymoquinone on DNA synthesis, proliferation, and viability of
cancerous (LNCaP, C4-2B, PC-3, and DU145) but not noncancerous
prostate (BPH-1) epithelial cells. In AR-positive LNCaP and C4-2B
cells, this growth suppression was associated with a noticeable
decrease in AR and E2F-1 and an increase in proapoptotic proteins.
Furthermore, thymoquinone inhibited the growth of tumors
derived from androgen-independent C4-2B prostate cancer cells
in nude mice, and, as in cultured cells, this effect was associated
with a dramatic loss of AR and E2F-1 expression and induction of
apoptosis. Thus, we believe that thymoquinone may prove to be
effective in treating prostate cancer, particularly in hormonerefractory cases.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. C4-2B cells were generously provided by
Dr. Fazlul H. Sarkar (Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit,
MI) and BPH-1 cells by Dr. Simon W. Hayward (Vanderbilt University
Medical Center, Nashville, TN). LNCaP, C4-2B, and BPH-1 cells in RPMI
medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DU145 and PC-3 cells in DMEM
were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 mmol/L glutamine,
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 100 units/mL penicillin, and grown in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37jC. The medium
for LNCaP and C4-2B cells also contained 10 nmol/L testosterone and
10 mmol/L HEPES, respectively.
Cell synchronization. LNCaP cells in early passages (passages 3–12)
were synchronized by isoleucine deprivation as described before (29).
Synchronized G0-G1 phase cells were released from isoleucine blockade in
the absence or presence of 50 Amol/L thymoquinone. The ability of cells to
enter S phase was determined at regular intervals following release from
isoleucine blockade by pulse labeling the cells with 2 ACi/mL [3H]thymidine
(ICN Biomedicals) for 30 min at 37jC in a humidified incubator and
measuring the radioactivity incorporated into DNA as described before (29).
Cell proliferation and viability assays. LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and BPH-1
cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 per well in 96-well plates in
appropriate medium, allowed to grow for 24 to 48 h, and then treated with
increasing concentrations of thymoquinone (40–100 Amol/L; SigmaAldrich). Colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay was used to detect
live cells in each well as per manufacturer’s instructions. This involved
adding 20 AL/well CellTiter96 AQ One Solution (Promega) and incubating
the cells for 1 h in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37jC.
Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded using a AQuant microplate
spectrophotometer equipped with KCjunior Data Analysis Software
(Bio-Tek Instruments). The effect of thymoquinone on DNA synthesis was
measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. For this, LNCaP cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of thymoquinone for 48 h as
described above and pulse labeled with [3H]thymidine (2 ACi/mL) for
30 min, measuring the radioactivity incorporated into DNA as described
before (29).
Preparation of cell and tissue extracts. Exponentially growing or
synchronized cells in 150-mm cell culture dishes were collected by
trypsinization. They were first washed with and then suspended in buffer
A [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
250 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF, and 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4] supplemented
with protease inhibitor cocktail (P-8340, Sigma Chemical) at a density of
2  107 cells/mL. Cells were freeze-thawed and then thrice passed in and
out of a syringe with a 27-gauge needle (1.25 in.). For tissue extracts, tumors
were dissected in PBS to remove stromal contamination, cut into small

www.aacrjournals.org

pieces (1 mm3) using a scalpel, washed, and finally suspended in buffer A
containing the same protease inhibitor cocktail. The tissue suspension was
homogenized in a top-driven Wheaton Overhead Stirrer (Wheaton Instruments) until the tissue was completely dispersed (usually six strokes at a
speed setting of 3). Soluble cell and tissue extracts were cleared by
centrifugation at 3,800 rpm for 15 min in a Sorvall RT7 centrifuge equipped
with an RTH-750 rotor at 4jC. Protein concentration in soluble extracts was
assessed using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Western blot. Equal amounts of protein in individual fractions were
subjected to denaturing 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Individual membranes were probed with rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against AR, E2F-1, p21Cip1, and cyclin A (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal antibodies against p27Kip1, cyclindependent kinase (Cdk)-2, Cdk-4, Bax, and pRb (Transduction Labs, BD
Biosciences); or goat polyclonal antibodies against h-actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were developed using horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) and SuperSignal
WestPico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and visualized using X-ray
film.
Human prostate tumor xenograft mouse model. Five-week-old male
athymic nude mice (NCR Nu-M) were purchased from Taconic Research
Animal Services and housed under pathogen-free conditions according to
Wayne State University animal care guidelines. The animal protocols were
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and
Use Committee of Wayne State University. C4-2B cells (5  106) were
injected s.c. into one flank. Tumor size was measured with calipers every
other day. Tumor volume (V ) was determined by the equation V = (L  W 2)
 0.5, where L is the length and W is the width of the tumor. When
xenografts reached a volume of f100 mm3, the tumor-bearing mice were
randomly assigned to a control (solvent-treated) or thymoquinone-treated
group and given either solvent (mixture of PBS/cremophor/ethanol, 5:3:2)
or 20 mg/kg/d thymoquinone. When the control tumors reached f1,100
mm3 (on day 31), the experiment was terminated and the mice were
sacrificed. Part of each tumor was used to prepare the tissue extracts and
the remainder was fixed and paraffin embedded.
H&E staining, E2F-1 immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay.
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and
stained with hematoxylin for 1 min. After rinsing, the slides were stained
with eosin for 1 min, rinsed thoroughly, and mounted with Permount. For
E2F-1 immunohistochemistry, after deparaffinization and hydration, the
tissue sections were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide, incubated first
with a primary antibody to E2F-1 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
then with a biotinylated secondary antibody or antimouse immunoglobulin
G (H + L), incubated in ABC reagent (avidin-biotinylated horseradish
peroxidase complex), mounted, and visualized under a microscope.
Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay was done using an Apoptag Peroxidase In-Situ
Apoptosis Detection Kit from Chemicon as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, after deparaffinization and hydration, the tissue sections were
incubated with working strength terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase
enzyme and working strength stop/wash buffer, conjugated with antidigoxigenin, and then stained with peroxidase substrate. The tissue sections
were mounted under a glass coverslip in Permount and viewed under a
microscope.

Results
Thymoquinone inhibits proliferation and viability of
cancerous but not noncancerous prostate epithelial cells.
Because thymoquinone is a product of an herb used both in
cooking and medicinally in many parts of the world for centuries,
we predicted it would have very little cytotoxicity. To test this, we
studied the effect of thymoquinone on proliferation and viability of
noncancerous and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. As shown in
Fig. 1A, thymoquinone had very little effect on the morphology of

BPH-1 cells, which are considered noncancerous (30). However,
under similar treatment conditions, thymoquinone caused significant rounding of prostate cancer LNCaP cells. On [3H]thymidine
incorporation assay, thymoquinone inhibited DNA synthesis in
AR-positive LNCaP as well as AR-negative DU145 and PC-3
prostate cancer cells, but not in BPH-1 cells (Fig. 1B). The
inhibitory effect of thymoquinone on DNA synthesis in prostate
cancer cells was both dose and time dependent, with cells treated
with thymoquinone exhibiting an IC50 for [3H]thymidine incorporation of f75 Amol/L after 48 h (Fig. 1B) as against a relatively
lesser effect at 24 h and a greater effect at 72 h (data not shown).
Consistent with the inhibitory effect of thymoquinone on DNA
synthesis, MTS assay showed a dose-dependent decrease in viable
prostate cancer cells at 48 h (Fig. 1C). This decrease in viability was
likewise observed in prostate cancer cells but not in BPH-1 cells.
Thus, thymoquinone had a selective antiproliferative effect on
cancerous prostate epithelial cells.
Inhibitory effect of thymoquinone on proliferation and
viability of prostate cancer cells is associated with suppression
of AR and E2F-1. To clarify the molecular events involved in the
inhibitory effect of thymoquinone on proliferation and viability of
prostate cancer cells, we examined quantitative changes in specific
antiproliferative and proapoptotic proteins (including AR and
E2F-1) in LNCaP and BPH-1 cells following thymoquinone
treatment. We found a noticeable decrease in both AR and E2F-1
in LNCaP cells within 6 h after treatment with low doses of
thymoquinone (Fig. 2A), associated with increased levels of the
antiproliferative proteins p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 and the proapoptotic
protein Bax. By comparison, in similarly treated BPH-1 cells that
lacked AR, there was no change in either E2F-1 or its target proteins
such as Cdk-2 (Fig. 2A), cyclin E, and cyclin A (data not shown) even
at 24 h after treatment. Furthermore, thymoquinone had very little
effect on the Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (Fig. 2A). These
observations are consistent with the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of thymoquinone on LNCaP but not BPH-1 cells.
Because thymoquinone suppressed AR and E2F-1 in androgensensitive LNCaP cells, we examined whether similar effects could
be seen in androgen-independent C4-2B cells. As shown in Fig. 2C,
thymoquinone down-regulated both AR and E2F-1 in C4-2B cells,
just as it did in LNCaP cells. Interestingly, whereas thymoquinone
suppressed phospho-pRb (which results in E2F-1 activation) in
LNCaP cells, it down-regulated both phospho-pRb and non–
phospho-pRb in C4-2B cells. Thus, in both cell lines thymoquinone
seemed to affect not only the level but also the activity of E2F-1.
Decreased E2F-1 activity was also evident from down-regulation of
one of its target proteins, cyclin A, which showed a substantial
decrease in LNCaP and C4-2B cells treated with 25 Amol/L
thymoquinone even when significant residual E2F-1 was present
(Fig. 2B).
Thymoquinone inhibits progression of prostate cancer cells
from G1 to S phase. Because E2F-1 and AR play an important role
in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (29), we examined the
effect of the thymoquinone-induced decrease in E2F-1 and AR on
the ability of LNCaP cells to progress from G0-G1 to S phase. We
synchronized LNCaP cells by isoleucine deprivation in G0-G1 as
described before (29) and examined their ability to enter S phase
after release from isoleucine blockade in the absence (control) and
presence of thymoquinone. We used a concentration of thymoquinone (50 Amol/L) that was below the IC50 (75 Amol/L) required for
inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1B) and decreased viability
(Fig. 1C) of exponentially growing LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 3A,

Thymoquinone as a Therapeutic Agent for Prostate Cancer

release from isoleucine blockade (late-G1 phase), whereas in
thymoquinone-treated cells this increase in E2F-1 was blunted.
This dramatic decrease of E2F-1 in thymoquinone-treated cells as
compared with control LNCaP cells was also reflected in downregulation of several cell cycle regulatory proteins, including Cdk-4,
Cdk-2, and cyclin A (Fig. 3B), all of which are regulated by E2F-1 (9).
We also observed that Cdc6, an essential component of the
prereplication complex whose expression is regulated by E2F-1
(33), was also attenuated in thymoquinone-treated LNCaP cells
(data not shown). Thus, thymoquinone prevents cell growth by
blocking expression of the AR, E2F-1, and E2F-1-target cell cycle
regulatory proteins necessary for transition of prostate cancer cells
from G1 to S phase.
Thymoquinone suppresses the growth of tumors derived
from androgen-independent prostate cancer C4-2B cells in
nude mice. Because thymoquinone inhibited both the growth and
viability of prostate cancer cells under in vitro culture conditions,
we examined whether these antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects of thymoquinone could be observed in vivo in nude mice
that had prostate tumors growing from androgen-independent
C4-2B cells implanted in flank. To test the effect of thymoquinone
on tumor growth, thymoquinone (20 mg/kg) was administered
s.c. on a daily basis starting from the day when C4-2B tumors
reached f100 mm3. As shown in Fig. 4A, thymoquinone

proteins in LNCaP, C4-2B, and BPH-1 cells. Cells grown in 150-mm culture
dishes were treated with the indicated concentration of thymoquinone for 6 or
24 h. Cell extracts were prepared and Western blot was done on an equal
amount of protein as described in Materials and Methods. A, comparison of
protein levels between LNCaP and BPH-1 cells treated with thymoquinone for

we observed that whereas control cells released from isoleucine
blockade could progress synchronously from G1 to S, thymoquinone-treated cells failed to enter S phase as determined by their
inability to incorporate [3H]thymidine. Thus, down-regulation of
AR and E2F-1 in thymoquinone-treated G1 phase LNCaP cells
seems to contribute to their failure to enter S phase. We further
validated this possibility by measuring AR, E2F-1, and E2F-1-target
proteins in thymoquinone-treated LNCaP cells progressing from G1
to S. AR levels are reported to fluctuate with the cell cycle (31) and
increased AR in late G1 (8–12 h after release from isoleucine
blockade) is required for synchronized LNCaP cells to enter S phase
(32). As shown in Fig. 3B, this increase in AR in late G1 phase was
noticeable in control but not in thymoquinone-treated LNCaP cells.
In control cells, there was an increase in E2F-1 starting 12 h after

cancer cells in nude mice. Nude mice

are described in Materials and Methods.

administration suppressed growth of C4-2B tumors to half the size
of those found in solvent-treated controls at 31 days after the start
of treatment. Daily administration of thymoquinone had very little
effect on average body weight [26.6 F 2.86 g for thymoquinonetreated mice (n = 3) versus 27.3 F 0.75 g for the controls (n = 3)].
Thus, thymoquinone showed no discernible side effects in mice at
a dose that prevented growth of C4-2B tumors.
We next tested whether thymoquinone suppression of C4-2B
growth in mice was associated with down-regulation of AR and
E2F-1 in tumors, as in cultured cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, AR and
E2F-1 could be readily detected in tissue extracts of tumors from
solvent-treated controls but not thymoquinone-treated mice. There
was also a dramatic decrease in pRb and cyclin A expression in
C4-2B tumors of thymoquinone-treated mice compared with the
controls. These changes in AR, E2F-1, pRb, and cyclin A in
thymoquinone-treated C4-2B tumors in nude mice (Fig. 4B) are
consistent with the observed changes in these proteins in cultured
thymoquinone-treated C4-2B cells (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemical
staining of tumor tissue sections also revealed a dramatic decrease
in E2F-1 in tumors from thymoquinone-treated mice compared
with the controls (Fig. 4C). There were fewer live tumor cells and
increased infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors from thymoquinonetreated mice compared with the controls as determined by
H&E staining of tumor sections. Furthermore, TUNEL staining of
these tissue sections indicated massive apoptosis in tumors from
thymoquinone-treated mice compared with the controls (Fig. 4C),
consistent with the increase in Bax observed in thymoquinonetreated LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these observations

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

show that thymoquinone prevents growth of prostate cancer cells
both in vitro and in vivo by suppressing the expression of AR and
E2F-1.

Discussion
Our study shows that growth of prostate cancer cells is highly
sensitive to the inhibitory effect of thymoquinone, a natural
compound present in the seeds of the annual plant N. sativa. This
inhibitory action is highly selective, exhibiting very little effect on
growth of noncancerous prostate epithelial cells in culture and
preventing growth of human prostate tumors in nude mice without
causing any discernible side effects or changes in body weight. Our
studies show for the first time that thymoquinone induces
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in prostate cancer cells
by down-regulating AR and E2F-1, which play an important role
not only in the proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells
(6–8, 10, 11) but also in the development of hormone-refractory
disease (13, 34) for which there is no cure. Based on our
observation that thymoquinone inhibits proliferation and viability
of cancerous but not noncancerous cells, we propose that this
herbal agent be used not only for treatment but also for prevention
of hormone-sensitive as well as hormone-refractory prostate
cancer.
N. sativa has been used medicinally for thousands of years to
treat a variety of diseases including cancer. Oil extracted from
N. sativa seeds has been shown to have an antineoplastic effect
both in vitro and in vivo (23, 24, 35). Thymoquinone, a major

constituent in N. sativa seed oil, was reported to arrest papilloma
cells, canine osteosarcoma cells (COS31), and human colon cancer
cells (HCT-116) in the G1 phase (26, 27, 36). In papilloma cells, such
an arrest is associated with an increase in p16 and a decrease in
cyclin D1, whereas in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells, it is
associated with an increase in p21 and p53 (27) as well as a
significant decrease in Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic) protein (26). In this
study, we observed no significant change in Bcl-2 protein levels
(data not shown); instead, there was a noticeable increase in Bax, a
proapoptotic protein (Fig. 2B). Thymoquinone also caused G2-M
phase arrest in spindle carcinoma cells (27) associated with an
increase in p53 and a decrease in cyclin B1. In p53-null myeloplastic
leukemia HL-60 cells, thymoquinone induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 (37). Thymoquinone
inhibited proliferation of canine osteosarcoma (COS31) and its
cisplatin-resistant variant (COS31/rCDDP), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), and human ovarian adenocarcinoma (BG-1)
cells, but had very little effect on normal kidney cells (Madin-Darby
canine kidney cells; ref. 36). Thus, we concluded that thymoquinone
exhibits an antiproliferative effect on a variety of cancer cells but
not on normal cells. Accordingly, we observed that thymoquinone
had very little effect on the growth of noncancerous prostate
BPH-1 epithelial cells (Figs. 1 and 2A). Furthermore, treating mice
daily with a tumor growth–suppressing dose of thymoquinone
(20 mg/kg) neither affected body weight nor showed any discernible
side effects. Based on these observations, it is likely that
thymoquinone can offer a better treatment strategy in which
normal cells can be spared from the cytotoxic effect of the drugs
currently available for treatment of disseminated prostate cancer.
This study represents the first reported examination of the effect
of thymoquinone on cell cycle regulatory proteins in synchronized
prostate cancer cells progressing from G1 to S phase. We observed
that thymoquinone effectively blocked G1-phase prostate cancer
cells from entering S phase. The cell cycle inhibitory effect of
thymoquinone observed in the present study is consistent with
previous reports of thymoquinone-induced G1 arrest in other
cancer cell lines (26, 27). We found that blockade of cell entry into
S phase was associated with suppression of E2F-1, which is required
in late G1 phase for cells to proliferate (11, 38). E2F-1 is an essential
transcription factor for expression of a number of proteins involved
in G1-S transition and DNA synthesis (9), including cyclin E, cyclin
A, and Cdks (39). E2F-1 activity is regulated by pRb (40), and
we observed that thymoquinone decreased both E2F-1 and its
positive regulator phospho-pRb (Fig. 2B). Given that this is similar
to the decrease in E2F-1 levels and activity observed with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine in LNCaP cells (10), it is reasonable to posit that

thymoquinone blocks cell cycle progression by down-regulating
both the level and activity of E2F-1 in LNCaP cells as reflected by the
significant decrease in G1-S transition–specific cyclin A, Cdk-2, and
Cdk-4 in synchronized LNCaP cells treated with thymoquinone (Fig.
3B). Blockade of cyclin and Cdk expression could have contributed
to the failure of LNCaP cells to enter S phase.
We have previously shown that AR activity is required for
synchronized LNCaP cells to progress from G1 to S phase (29). We
found that AR activity in synchronized LNCaP cells increased in the
mid to late G1 phase (i.e., 8–12 h after release from isoleucine
blockade), and this increase was abolished in thymoquinonetreated cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, AR down-regulation, particularly in the
mid to late G1 phase, could be another mechanism by which
thymoquinone exerts an antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer
cells. AR is also necessary for viability of prostate cancer cells (8),
and AR down-regulation can trigger proapoptotic events. Accordingly, thymoquinone treatment resulted in induction of p21Cip1 and
p27Kip1, which cause cell cycle arrest, and an increase in Bax, which
promotes apoptosis (Fig. 2A). E2F-1 overexpression has been
associated with AR down-regulation in hormone-resistant prostate
cancer (13). We now observed that thymoquinone not only downregulated E2F-1 but also suppressed AR. Thus, thymoquinone
seems to induce antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects by
suppressing expression of both E2F-1 and AR in prostate cancer
cells.
In summary, natural agents are advantageous for application
to humans because of their mild mechanism of action and their
ability to spare normal cells. Thymoquinone, a component of
the herb N. sativa, has gained attention in the last decade for its
notable antiproliferative effect on a variety of cancer but not normal
cell lines. This is the first study examining the effect of
thymoquinone on cell cycle regulatory and proapoptotic proteins
in synchronized prostate cancer cells progressing from G1 to
S phase. These studies show the effectiveness of thymoquinone in
down-regulating AR and E2F-1 and inducing proapoptotic proteins
such as p53, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and Bax in androgen-sensitive prostate
cancer cells. Together, these observations warrant clinical trials to
examine the effectiveness of thymoquinone as adjuvant therapy for
androgen-sensitive and hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
