ABSTRACT
The fusion between anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and echinoderm
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) is a causative factor in a unique subset
of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Although the inhibitor
crizotinib, as it blocks the kinase activity of the resulting EML4-ALK fusion protein,
displays remarkable initial responses, a fraction of NSCLC cases eventually become
resistant to crizotinib by acquiring mutations in the ALK domain or activating bypass
pathways via EGFR, KIT, or KRAS. Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory provides a plausible
explanation for acquisition of tumorigenesis and resistance. However, the question as
to whether EML4-ALK-driven tumorigenesis is linked with the stem-like property and
whether the stemness is an effective target in controlling EML4-ALK+ NSCLC including
crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cells has not been addressed. Here, we report that stemlike properties stem from ALK activity in EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells. Notably, treatment
with rapamycin, a CSC targeting agent, attenuates stem-like phenotypes of the EML4ALK+ cells, which increased capability of tumor formation and higher expression
of stemness-associated molecules such as ALDH, NANOG, and OCT4. Importantly,
combinational treatment with rapamycin and crizotinib leads to synergistic anti-tumor
effects on EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells as well as on those resistant to crizotinib. Thus,
we provide a proof of principle that targeting stemness would be a novel strategy to
control intractable EML4-ALK+ NSCLC.

approved as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor for the treatment
of EML4-ALK+ NSCLC patients. Although most patients
with ALK-rearranged NSCLC derive substantial clinical
benefit from crizotinib, a fraction of tumors eventually
become resistant to crizotinib [4]. The acquired resistance
to crizotinib is highly associated with secondary mutations
in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain and amplification of
the ALK fusion gene. Among them, L1196M in the ALK
gatekeeper site was first identified in a crizotinib-resistant
patient in Japan [5]. Also, non-gatekeeper mutations such
as L1152R, C1156Y, and G1269A, were proposed to be

INTRODUCTION
About 3%–7% of NSCLC tumors are driven by an
activating fusion of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and
echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)
genes [1, 2]. The resulting EML4-ALK fusion protein is
constitutively active in these cancer cells and is a driver
of tumorigenesis for these cells. In this fusion protein,
the complete intracellular portion of ALK is preserved,
and hence cancer cells harboring this fusion are sensitive
to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibition [3]. Crizotinib was

associated with resistance to inhibitors used in the treatment
of ALK+ NSCLC [5–7]. In addition, another mechanism
of ALK-dependent resistance occurs upon activation of
alternative signaling pathways via EGFR, KIT, or KRAS
with known tumor promoting properties [8–11]. Hence,
considerable efforts are now underway to develop secondgeneration ALK inhibitors designated to overcome this
clinical challenge. Unfortunately, however, crizotinibresistant NSCLC becomes resistant to the second-generation
inhibitors by acquiring additional mutations in the ALK
domain or activating the bypass signaling pathways. Thus,
there is an urgent need to clinically develop a novel and
fundamental strategy which can break the vicious cycle of
acquired ALK resistance.
In the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, CSCs
denote a subtype of cancer cells that has the ability to selfrenew and generate diversity of cell in the tumor [12, 13].
These cells have been characterized with ‘stem-like’
properties and although may be few in number, they may
be drivers of tumorigenesis in a tumor bulk [14, 15]. In spite
of controversies in the cancer stem cell theory, there have
been many reports about the existence of a small population
of stem-like cancer cells in multiple types of human cancer
including NSCLC [16–18]. It is notable that the stem-like
property of CSCs may be linked with intractable tumor
recurrence and a causative reason for therapeutic failure [15,
19, 20]. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the
CSC-targeting drugs used to treat recurrent and intractable
cancer provide superior benefit in cancer treatment to
conventional cancer drugs, although their exact mechanism
of action remains to be determined [21–23].
Here, we report that EML4-ALK-driven tumorigenesis
is linked with a stem-like property and that the ALK activity
plays a key role in maintaining stem-like properties of EML4ALK+ NSCLC cells as characterized by increased capability
of tumor formation and expression of stemness-associated
molecules such as ALDH, NANOG, and OCT4. Notably, we
demonstrate that rapamycin, a CSC-specific target, is effective
in reversing the stem-like properties of the EML4-ALK+
cells. Moreover, the combinational treatment with rapamycin
and crizotinib leads to synergistic anti-tumor effects on
EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells as well as on those that acquired
resistance to crizotinib. Taken together, our findings show that
CSC drugs targeting stem-like traits of cancer cells could be
effective in controlling refractory EML4-ALK+ NSCLC.

different lung epithelial cell lines, including primary and
immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B),
EML4-ALK− NSCLC cells (A549), and EML4-ALK+
NSCLC cells (EML4-ALK variant 1 (EAV1)-expressing
H3122 and EML4-ALK variant 3 (EAV3)-expressing
H2228). As shown in Figure 1A, EML4-ALK+ cells (H3122,
H2228) had higher tumorosphere-forming capacity with
statistical significance than immortalized primary epithelial
cells (BEAS-2B) and EML4-ALK− NSCLC cells (A549)
when cultured under suspension conditions within minimal
growth factor supplementation. To assess the molecular
basis for the enhanced stem-like phenotype of EML4-ALK+
cells, we also examined the expression of the stem cell
related molecules such as NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4,
and c-MYC and the activated form of ALK, phospho-ALK
(Y1604), through western blot analysis with lysates of the
monolayer-cultured cells. As results, expression levels of
these stem cell related molecules in EML4-ALK+ cells,
H3122 and H2228, were higher than those in EML4-ALK−
cells, BEAS-2B and A549 (Figure 1B).
To assess the contribution of EML4-ALK in
acquisition of stemness, we treated H3122 and H2228
cells with ALK-specific small interfering RNA (siALK).
Administration of siALK reduced the expression of
NANOG and OCT4, but not in SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC
(Figure 1C). It was demonstrated that cancer stem cells of
NSCLC were characterized by aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) positive population [24, 25]. Consistently, siRNAtargeting ALK reduced the frequency of ALDH+ cells in
H3122 cells by one and a half fold and H2228 cells by three
fold compared with control siGFP-treated cells (Figure 1D).
Furthermore, the siALK-treated cells formed approximately
four fold fewer tumorspheres than the siGFP-treated cells
(Figure 1E). It was reported that EML4-ALK variant 1
(EAV1) has the highest frequency in patient with EML4ALK+ lung cancer [26, 27]. In addition, H3122 cells
expressing EAV1 have higher tumorigenic potential than
H2228 cells expressing EAV3 (Figure 1A). Therefore, we
evaluated in vivo tumorigenicity of EML4-ALK+ H3122
cell after transfectoin of siALK or siGFP. As shown in
Figure 1F and 1G, siALK-treated cells were significantly
less tumorigenic than the siGFP-treated cells when
transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. These results suggest
that EML4-ALK contributes to their stem-like phenotypes
and provides tumorigenic advantage to tumor cells.
To demonstrate whether EML4-ALK directly
enhances the stem-like phenotypes of NSCLC cells, we
retrovirally-transduced EML4-ALK− A549 NSCLC cells
with EML4-ALK variant 1 (A549/EAV1) or empty vector
(A549/no insert), and then characterized their stem-like
phenotypes (Figure 2). Compared with A549/no insert
cells, ectopic expression of EAV1 increased expression of
NANOG and OCT4, and the frequency of ALDH+ cells in
A549 cells (Figure 2A and 2B). Moreover, overexpression
of EAV1 improved the tumorosphere-forming capacity of
A549 cells (Figure 2C). Taken together, these data clearly

by variable primary response and acquired resistance.
Data from Figure 3 demonstrates that inhibition of
stemness effectively reduced tumorigenicity of EML4ALK+ NSCLC cells, suggesting that targeting stemness
could be a plausible strategy to treat EML4-ALK+ tumor
cells. To explore this possibility more directly, we treated
EML4-ALK+ H3122 cells with well-characterized CSC
targeting drugs such as rapamycin, salinomycin, and
metformin [21–23, 29]. These drugs showed distinct
cytotoxicity over a broad range of doses (Supplementary
Figure S1B). Among them, rapamycin was the most
effective in decreasing the expression level of stem cell
related molecules and the CSC marker, and in inhibiting
the tumorosphere formation in the nano-molar range of
sub-lethal doses (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). Hence, our data
demonstrates that rapamycin significantly reduces the
stem-like properties of EML4-ALK+ cells.

EML4-ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, diminishes the
stem-like properties of EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells
Accumulating evidence indicates that ALK activity
of EML4-ALK fusion protein mediates tumorigenicity of
NSCLC cells via various oncogenic signaling pathways
including PI3K/AKT signaling, which is a key regulator of
stem-like properties in a cancer stem cell population [17,
28]. On the basis of these findings, we determined whether
ALK activity is essential for the stem-like phenotypes of
EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells. For this purpose, we treated
H3122 cells with crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, and DMSO as
control, and then characterized their stem-like phenotypes.
Compared with DMSO-treated H3122 cells, crizotinibtreated cells showed a decrease in expression of NANOG and
OCT4 and frequencies of ALDH+ cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3A and 3B). The decrease in the expression
of stem cell related molecules was not likely to be due to
cytotoxicity because more than 80% of cells were alive at
the highest dose (1 μM of crizotinib) used in this experiment
(Supplementary Figure S1A). The crizotinib-treated cells
gradually and consistently lost their sphere-forming capacity
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). Thus, our results
indicate that EML4-ALK-mediated stem-like phenotypes are
dependent on the ALK activity and anti-tumor effects caused
by crizotinib treatment at least partially are related with loss
of stem-like potentials in EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells.

Co-treatment with rapamycin enhances the
anti-tumor effects of crizotinib on EML4-ALK+
NSCLC cells
Stem-like properties are reported to be involved in
tumorigenicity and survival of recurrent tumor after the
conventional cancer therapy [15, 19, 20]. As shown in
Figure 4, rapamycin appeared to decrease the stem-like
potential of the EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells. On the basis
of those observations, we tested whether co-treatment with
stemness-targeting drugs such as rapamycin could enhance
anti-tumor effects of crizotinib. To verify it, we treated
EML4-ALK+ H3122 cells with indicated concentrations of
crizotinib and rapamycin, either alone or in combination
as shown in Figure 5A. Co-treatment with crizotinib
and rapamycin synergistically decreased the expression
level of the stemness factor such as NANOG and OCT4
along with the frequency of ALDH+ cells compared to
each single treatment (Figure 5A and 5B). Furthermore,

Rapamycin decreases stem-like phenotypes in
EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells

crizotinib treatment can reduce the stem-like properties
of EML4-ALK+ tumor cells, but its efficacy is limited

compared to single-agent treatments, co-treatment resulted
in formation of almost ten fold fewer tumorospheres
(Figure 5C).
To evaluate in vivo anti-tumor effects, thermosensitive chitosan hydrogels containing cancer therapeutic
agents have been previously used for sustained release of
drugs at local tumor sites [30]. To assess the therapeutic
value of co-administration of crizotinib and rapamycin,
H3122 cells were inoculated into nude mice, and then
9 days later, chitosan hydrogels containing crizotinib,
rapamycin, or both were administered intratumorally.
Although treatments with each single-agent elicited a
profound therapeutic effect, co-treatment was much
more effective at delaying the growth of the EML-ALK+
xenograft as shown in Figure 5D. Also co-treatment
effectively reduced the weight of the tumor (Figure
5E). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that
co-treatment with crizotinib and rapamycin is superior in
potency than treatment with either agent alone in EML4ALK+ NSCLC cells.

was activated in crizotinib-resistant H3122 CR1 cells
compared to crizotinib-sensitive (parental) H3122 cells as
shown in Figure 6A. The expression levels of NANOG
and OCT4 were also higher in the H3122 CR1 cells than
in the H3122 cells. On the basis of these observations,
we inhibited mTOR signaling by using repamycin, and
determined the effects on crizotinib sensitivity in H3122
CR1 cells. As expected, H3122 CR1 cells were sensitive
to rapamycin treatment while they were resistant to
crizotinib treatment (Figure 6B and 6C). Combined
treatment synergistically reduced the expression levels of
the stemness factors and the frequency of ALDH+ cells
compared to single-agent treatment (Figure 6D and 6E).
Moreover, co-treatment led to formation of almost four
to six fold fewer tumorospheres compared to singleagent treatment (Figure 6F). These findings indicate that
EGFR-mTOR pathway has a role in maintaining stem-like
phenotypes and downstream signaling in the presence of
continuous ALK inhibition.
These findings prompted us to further investigate
in vivo anti-tumor effects of rapamycin alone or in
combination with crizotinib on H3122 CR1 cells.
Interestingly, co-treatment was more effective at
delaying the growth rate of the H3122 CR1 xenograft
tumor as shown in Figure 6G, although treatment with
rapamycin alone also elicited a profound therapeutic
effect. In contrast, single treatment with crizotinib
failed to retard the growth of the xenograft tumor at the
dose used in the experiment. In addition, co-treatment
resulted in the lowest tumor weight for the established
tumors (Figure 6H). Taken together, these data suggest
that the ALK and mTOR inhibitor combination may
provide an attractive treatment strategy for ALK TKIresistant states.

Rapamycin sensitizes crizotinib-resistant H3122
CR1 cells to ALK inhibition
Previously, we established H3122 CR1 cells that
were resistant to crizotinib by exposure to increasing
concentrations of crizotinib through an in vitro longterm culture. H3122 CR1 cells have the L1196M of ALK
mutation, and display ligand-dependent EGFR activation
by up-regulating amphiregulin and EGF [11]. EGFR
signaling is one of the major upstream regulators of
mTOR, and its activation induces resistance to crizotinib
[9] as well as cancer stemness [31, 32]. In agreement
with this finding, the EGFR-mTOR signaling pathway

DISCUSSION

of NANOG and OCT4 expression [33]. As shown in
Figure 4A, we also have found that the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin reduced expression of NANOG and OCT4
in EAV1-exressiong H3122 cells. Taken together, those
data clearily demonstrate mTOR signaling is essential
in EML4-ALK-mediated stem-like properties although
an exact mechanism how mTOR signaling can regulate
the expression of NANOG and OCT4 in EML4-ALK+
NSCLC cells still remains elusive.
It has been documented that targeting stemness
of cancer can potentiate the effects of chemotherapy or
radiotherapy [14, 41–43]. Similarly, we propose that
treatment with stemness-targeting agent rapamycin could
sensitize EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells to conventional
cancer drugs including ALK inhibitors. In this study,
we clearly demonstrated that mTOR inhibition renders
EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells more vulnerable to crizotinibmediated apoptotic death, and this inhibition even
re-sensitizes acquired crizotinib-resistant NSCLC
cells, H3122CR1, to crizotinib. Similar results were
also observed in SNU-2535 cells previously derived
from a crizotinib-resistant patient who harbored the
G1269 mutation in the ALK domain [11]. One plausible
explanation for the synergistic anti-tumor effects is that
rapamycin and crizotinib share common AKT-mTOR
axis and its down-stream target molecules, NANOG and
OCT4, as these are considered to be essential for tumor
maintenance in many malignancies [28, 44, 45].
Recently, we reported about the ligand-dependent
EGFR activation in both H3122 CR1 cells and SNU2535, a lung cancer cell line derived from a patient who
had developed acquired resistance to crizotinib [11]. It
is noteworthy the crizotinib-resistant H3122 CR1 cells
had more phosphorylated EGFR when compared with
H3122 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Consistently,
the level of EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin and
EGF is significantly higher in H3122 CR cells than in
H3122 cells [11]. The level of pEGFR in H3122 CR cells
substantially decreased by adding rapamycin but not
crizotinib as shown in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure
S3B. It has been reported that an aberrant mTOR signal
cascade increases the expression of various growth factors
including EGFR ligands [46]. Those observations suggests
mTOR signaling could trigger the activation of EGFR by
up-regulating EGFR ligands in in EML4-ALK+ NSCLC
cells. This possibility need to be elucidated. Nevertheless,
however, it is clear that a bypass mechanism via activation
of EGFR-AKT-mTOR signaling could be one of the
causes of crizotinib resistance in H3122 CR1 cells, and
rapamycin definitely abrogated the acquired resistance
due to EGFR activation by targeting its downstream
signaling molecule, mTOR. Since other bypass pathways
of acquired ALK resistance, via KIT, KRAS, or IGF-1R,
could also be converged on AKT-mTOR axis, rapamycin
could be effective in sensitizing these ALK resistant cells
caused by the bypass signalings. Collectively, our results

In this study, we examined, for the first time, the
role of EML4-ALK in stem-like properties of NSCLC
tumor cells, which was validated both in vitro and in vivo.
EML4-ALK up-regulated the expression of NANOG and
OCT4 proteins, which is dependent on its ALK enzymatic
activity. Consistently, ALK inhibition with crizotinib
reversed the stem-like phenotypes of EML4-ALK+ tumor
cells, suggesting ALK signaling is a central molecular
axis in the stem-like phenotype of EML4-ALK+ tumor
cells. Of note, it is a remarkable finding that EML4-ALK
induces a stem-like phenotype in NSCLC cells. This
may not be entirely surprising since EML-ALK activates
various downstream signaling molecules including
ERK, STAT3, and AKT, which are the key elements in
inducing and maintaining stem-like properties for both
normal stem cells and cancer stem cells [17, 18, 28, 29,
33]. Nonetheless, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms by which ALK functions. A further study
is needed to elucidate the role of ALK signaling in the
development of the stem-like phenotype of NSCLC cells.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
a serine/threonine kinase existing in two functionally
distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2), is
commonly up-regulated in various human cancers
including NSCLC [34–37]. Besides, there have been
reports suggesting that the AKT-mTOR axis is associated
with the maintaining cancer stemness. Cancer stem cells
also show preferential sensitivity to inhibition of the
pathway when compared to normal stem cells [38, 39].
Importantly, in accordance with the previous findings,
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin effectively suppressed
the EML4-ALK-induced stem-like characteristics at
nano-molar doses. As shown in Supplementary Figure
S2A, even at 1nM dose, rapamycin, was potent enough
to decrease the phosphorylation of mTOR and its target
S6K by over two fold without affecting phosphoylation
of ALK. To find out clue to the function of an mTOR
inhibitor that decreases the stem-like phenotypes of
EML4-ALK+ cells, we further investigated the relationship
between the EML4-ALK-induced stem-like phenotypes
and AKT-mTOR signaling in EML4-ALK+ H3122 cells
treated with siGFP or siALK (Supplementary Figure S2B).
Interestingly, siALK treatment drastically reduced the
phosphorylation of AKT on threonine 308 (T308), which
is an upstream regulator of mTOR, and in turn dampened
the phosphorylation of mTOR and its target S6K by
over three fold compared to control siGFP treatment.
Conversely, retroviral transduction of EML4-ALK− A549
NSCLC cells with EML4-ALK variant 1 led to activation
of both AKT and mTOR molecules (data not shown).
Consistently, previous studies by other groups also have
reported that EML4-ALK activates various downstream
signaling molecules including AKT and mTOR [40].
Moreover, aberrant mTOR activation led to the increase

suggest that targeting of mTOR can be helpful in reversing
the acquired crizotinib resistance.
Taken together, our findings clearly provide new
insights suggesting that stem-like properties can be a
pivotal driver of EML4-ALK-mediated tumorigenicity of
NSCLC cells and inhibition of mTOR signaling can be a
potential strategy to clinically control intractable stem-like
phenotypes of EML4-ALK+ NSCLC.

Synthetic siGFP, siALK had the following sequences :
GFP, 5′-GCAUCAAGGUGAACUUCAA-3′(sense), 5′ UUGAAGUUCACCUUGAUCGC - 3′(antisense); ALK,
5′ - CCGCUUUGCCGAUAGAAUA - 3′(sense), 5′ UAUUCUAUCGGCAAAGCGG - 3′(antisense); and they
were obtained commercially (Bioneer Inc., Korea). siRNA
was delivered in vitro into 6-well plates at a dose of 200 pmol
per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Korea).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice

Flow cytometry analysis

Six- to eight-week-old female nude and NOD/
SCID mice (Raon Bio Inc., Korea) were maintained
and handled under the protocol approved by the Korea
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(KUIACUC-2014-32). All animal procedures were
conducted in accordance with recommendations for the
proper care and use of laboratory animals.

H3122, H3122 CR1, and A549 cells were harvested
by trypsinization and stained using the Aldefluor®
stem cell detection kit (Stem Cell Technologies), as
previously described [24]. Briefly, cultured cells were
incubated in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing the
ALDH protein substrate (BAAA, 1 μmol/1 L per 1 × 106
cells) for 45 min at 37°C. In each experiment, a sample
of cells was stained by the addition of 40 mmol/L of
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a specific ALDH
inhibitor during the incubation, as negative control. All
data analysis was conducted on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) with
CellQuest Pro software. Also, all data were normalized
to the control group and presented as mean ± standard
deviation.

DNA constructs
To generate pMSCV/EML4-ALK variant 1
construct, the DNA fragment encoding EML4-ALK
variant 1 was amplified from pBabe-EML4-ALK
variant 1 [1] using a set of primers : forward : 5′GCGAATTCGGTTTCGCCGGCAGTCT - 3′, reverse : 5′
- GCGAATTCAGACTGCCGGCGAAACC - 3′. The PCR
product was continuously cloned into EcoRI restriction
sites of the pMSCV retroviral vector (Clontech, Korea). In
the experiment, plasmid integrity was confirmed by DNA
sequencing.

Western blot
5 × 105 cells were rinsed twice with PBS and
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, 0.5 mM EDTA) was added. Protein concentration
determination and immunoblotting were conducted as
described previously [28]. Primary antibodies against
ALK, pALK (Y1604), c-MYC, EGFR, pEGFR (Y1068),
AKT, pAKT (T308), pAKT (S473), mTORC1, pmTORC1
(S2448), S6K, pS6K (S240/244) (Cell Signaling
Technology, MA, USA); SOX2, OCT4, and KLF4 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); NANOG (Abnova,
CA, USA) were used at 1:1000–1:3000 dilution. The
β-ACTIN antibody (1:10000 dilution) was purchased from
Sigma. Immune-reactive bands were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence imaging (Elpis Biotech, Korea).

Reagents and cell lines
Crizotinib, rapamycin, salinomycin, metformin
and puromycin were purchased from Sigma (St.Louis,
MO, USA). Each compound was dissolved in DMSO for
cell culture experiments. But metformin was dissolved in
PBS. Human NCI-H3122 (parental) cells were provided
by Pasi A. Janne (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston,
MA, USA). NCI-H2228 and A549 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC;
Manassas, VA, USA). SNU-2535 cells were established
at the Korean Cell Bank using pleural effusion in a patient
who had developed acquired resistance to crizotinib.
H3122 crizotinib-resistant (H3122 CR1) cells that were
generated by an increasing dose of crizotinib [11]. H3122,
H3122 CR1, SNU-2535, and A549 cells were cultured
in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. All cells
were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The A549
EAV1 (EML4-ALK variant 1) cell line was produced
by retroviral transduction of A549 cells with pMSCV/
EML4-ALK variant 1 using pMSCV vector-Phoenix
packaging cell line system followed by puromycin (1 μg/
ml) selection.

Tumorsphere-forming assay
Tumorsphere formation was measured as previously
described [28]. H3122, H3122 CR1, or A549 cells were
plated at 1 × 104 cells per well in 24-well, super-low
adherence vessels (Corning, USA) containing serum-free
DMEM-F12 (Thermo Scientific, USA) supplemented with
1X B27, basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml), and
epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml). Crizotinib, Rapamycin,
Salinomycin and Metformin were added to the sphere

H3122 cells were transfected with siGFP and
siALK twice using Lipofectamine 2000 at a 24-hr interval.
Twenty-four hours after secondary transfection, viable
cells were harvested by trypsinization and then they were
washed and resuspended in Opti-MEM. NOD/SCID mice
were subcutaneously injected with 104 or 105 cells. Tumor
formation was monitored at least 3 times per week and for
27 days after tumor injection. After 20 days, tumor tissue
was excised and weighed.

Tumor treatment experiments
For in vivo treatment experiments, nude mice were
inoculated subcutaneously with 106 H3122 or H3122
CR1 tumor cells per mouse. Before starting treatment,
mice (n = 5 per group) were randomized to: a) DMSO
(control), b) crizotinib only (20 mg/kg), c) rapamycin
only (0.3 mg/kg), or d) combination treatment, and they
were monitored regularly for 23 days. In addition, tumor
dimensions (length and width) were measured 3 times per
week with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated as
length (mm) × width2 (mm2) × 0.52. For drug treatment,
CH (chitosan hydrogel) containing the drug or DMSO was
injected intratumorally. CH was prepared as described
previously [30].
