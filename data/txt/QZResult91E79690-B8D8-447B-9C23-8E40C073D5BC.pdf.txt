ABSTRACT
Adipocytes promote cancer progression and impair treatment, and have been
shown to protect acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from chemotherapies. Here
we investigate whether this protection is mediated by changes in oxidative stress.
Co-culture experiments showed that adipocytes protect ALL cells from oxidative stress
induced by drugs or irradiation. We demonstrated that ALL cells induce intracellular
ROS and an oxidative stress response in adipocytes. This adipocyte oxidative stress
response leads to the secretion of soluble factors which protect ALL cells from
daunorubicin (DNR). Collectively, our investigation shows that ALL cells elicit an
oxidative stress response in adipocytes, leading to adipocyte protection of ALL cells
against DNR.

INTRODUCTION

aberrations [18, 19]. This increased ROS can have both
beneficial and detrimental effects [20, 21]. Cancer cells
maintain a balance of ROS by activation of oxidative
stress response genes, many of which are regulated by
the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) [22, 23]. The increased expression of
oxidative stress response genes contributes to cancer
cell resistance to chemotherapies such as anthracyclines
[24, 25], which work in part by inducing oxidative stress.
Given the significant protection that adipocytes provide
to ALL cells, particularly against the anthracycline
daunorubicin (DNR) [16], we investigated whether
adipocytes protect ALL cells from chemotherapies by
relieving oxidative stress.

Excess body weight contributes to as many as 1 out
of 5 of all cancer-related deaths [1]. A landmark paper by
Calle et al. found a significant association between obesity
and mortality from many types of cancer [2]. Many solid
tumors reside in locations rich with adipocytes, including
breast, ovarian, pancreatic, colon, and prostate cancers,
and some studies have shown that adipocytes interact with
cancer cells [3–6]. Obesity has also shown to be associated
with poorer event-free survival in the hematological
cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [7–9], and
we and others have demonstrated that leukemia/lymphoma
cells can be found in close proximity to adipocytes in the
bone marrow [10–12] and adipose tissue [13–15]. We also
showed that adipocytes protect ALL cells from a variety of
chemotherapeutic agents, though the mechanisms of this
protection remain unclear [16, 17]. Here, we investigate
the role of adipocytes in alleviating oxidative stress caused
by chemotherapy treatment in ALL cells.

DNR in a direct co-culture system [16]; however, we did
not test whether protection against DNR requires cellcell contact, nor did we test whether this occurs with
human ALL cell lines. Therefore, we cultured ~2 × 105
mouse (8093) and human (BV173, RS4;11, and Nalm6)
ALL cells in TransWells above 3T3-L1 adipocytes,
preadipocytes (fibroblasts), or no feeder layer. Transwells
contained polycarbonate membranes with 0.4 μm pores,
allowing free diffusion of media without direct cell-cell
contact. Adipocytes protected mouse and human ALL cells
from DNR, compared to no feeder and pre-adipocytes
(Figure 1A). The human adipocyte Chub-S7 cell line
also protected human ALL cells against DNR in similar
transwell cultures. While 24 hours of DNR treatment led
to increased cleaved caspase 3 in BV173 cells, indicating
apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway, this was reversed in the
presence of adipocytes (Figure 1B). 3T3-L1 adipocytes
also protected BV173 ALL cells from the anthracycline
doxorubicin (Figure 1C).
Our data indicates that direct cell-cell contact is
not necessary for the protection against DNR, implying
the existence of soluble factors mediating this protection.
Surprisingly, we found that adipocyte conditioned media
(ACM) did not protect ALL cells from DNR (Figure 1D).
However, media conditioned by both adipocytes and
leukemia cells simultaneously (ALCM) protected 8093
and BV173 from DNR treatment compared to both control
media and ACM (Figure 1D), and reduced DNR induced
cleavage of caspase 3 in 8093 cells (Figure 1E). Similar
results were observed when media was conditioned
serially by ALL cells and then adipocytes (not shown).
ALCM also protected ALL cells from apoptosis as
measured by Annexin V, though this did not reach
statistical significance in BV173 cells (Figure  1F).
Together, these results imply that adipocytes release
protective factors when stimulated by ALL cells.
Since DNR is a potent inducer of ROS [27], which
contributes to its cytotoxicity, we next investigated
whether adipocytes prevented DNR induction of ROS.
We used DCFH-DA to directly measure intracellular ROS
in Nalm6 cells during DNR treatment. DNR induced
intracellular ROS within 6 hours in a dose-dependent
manner, and this was significantly reduced in the presence
of adipocytes, but not fibroblasts (Figure 2A). A similar
pattern was observed in using the dye CellRox®, which
demonstrated that ALCM protected all three human
ALL cell lines from the DNR induction of intracellular
ROS (Figure 2B). ALL cells exhibited an oxidative
stress response after DNR treatment, as demonstrated
by an increase in gene expression of the two subunits of
the glutathione producing enzyme, glutamate cysteine
ligase (GCLC and GCLM, Figure 2C). However, coculturing with either 3T3-L1 or Chub-S7 adipocytes
reversed the induction of these oxidative stress response
genes (Figure 2C). Interestingly, expression of both
genes decreased slightly, but significantly, in 8093 cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

co-cultured with adipocytes without DNR treatment (black
bar vs. white bar), potentially indicating alleviation of the
basal level of oxidative stress. A similar pattern of GCLC
and GCLM expression was also observed with Nalm6
ALL cells (data not shown).
To test whether adipocyte protection of ALL cells
from oxidative stress was specific to that induced by DNR,
we used additional inducers of oxidative stress. ALL cells
were treated with chaetocin, a fungal-derived toxin that
inhibits thioredoxin reductase-1, leading to increased
cellular oxidative stress. Adipocytes significantly
protected all three ALL cell lines from chaetocin induced
cell death (Figure 2D). We also found that co-culturing
with adipocytes modestly improved the viability of
BV173 ALL cells that had been irradiated with 12 and
18 Gy (Figure 2E), though in this case adipocytes did not
offer significantly more protection than pre-adipocytes.
Although both chaetocin and irradiation cause insults
besides just oxidative stress, these results are consistent
with the findings that adipocytes protect ALL cells from
oxidative stress induced cytotoxicity.

ALL cells induce oxidative stress in adipocytes
To investigate how ALL cells stimulate adipocytes
to secrete protective factors, we exposed adipocytes
to leukemia cell conditioned media (LCM) for
24 hours, and performed Affymetrix microarray
analysis on the adipocytes. We found 3,528 significant
gene expression changes (p < 0.05) in the adipocytes,
including upregulation of many genes in the oxidative
stress response pathway (Table 1 shows the top 10 most
upregulated genes, ranked by fold change). Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified the Nrf2-mediated
oxidative stress response to be one of the most affected
pathways in adipocytes, with 47 genes differentially
regulated down-stream of the pathway (Ingenuity®
Systems, www.ingenuity.com, Table 2), implying that
ALL cells were inducing oxidative stress in adipocytes.
To directly test whether ALL cells induce oxidative stress
in adipocytes, we visualized adipocyte intracellular ROS
with DCFH-DA using fluorescence confocal microscopy.
After 48 hours of co-culture with BV173 cells in a
TransWell system, adipocytes had increased intracellular
ROS (Figure 3A and 3B), to a similar degree as adipocytes
treated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) as a positive
control. Co-culture with ALL cells also induced a
significant upregulation of the oxidative stress response
genes, HO-1 and ADM, and a non-statistically significant
increase in Mt2 gene expression (Figure 3C), as well as
increased HO-1 protein levels (Figure 3D), confirming
our microarray findings. Consistent with this, glutathione
concentration in media conditioned by 3T3-L1 adipocytes
together with BV173 ALL cells for 48 hours was higher
than media conditioned by adipocytes or leukemia cells
alone (Figure 3E).

after conditioning as a control (+ CoCl2). Thus, induction
of oxidative stress response by CoCl2 induces adipocytes
to secrete factors which protect ALL cells from DNR.
To further hone in on which aspects of the
adipocyte oxidative stress response are responsible for

their protection of ALL cells against DNR, we blocked
parts of the oxidative stress response in adipocytes
prior to coculturing with ALL cells. BSO, an inhibitor
of glutamylcysteine ligase, completely suppressed
intracellular GSH levels in adipocytes, while auranofin

increased GSH levels, likely a compensatory effect from
blocking thioredoxin synthesis (Figure 5A). Neither
treatment resulted in visible morphological changes to
the adipocytes. ALL cells and LCM had no measurable
effect on adipocyte GSH levels. Pretreatment of 3T3-L1
adipocytes with BSO only partially reversed their ability
to protect BV173 and Nalm6 against DNR (Figure 5B).
Similar results were observed with ChubS7 human
adipocytes (Figure 5C). However, pretreatment of 3T3-L1
adipocytes with AUR did not affect DNR protection
(Figure 5D), nor did it add to the effect of BSO to reduce
adipocyte protection (not shown). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that GSH synthesis may partly
contribute to the adipocyte’s ability to protect ALL cells
from DNR.

induction of intracellular ROS caused by DNR treatment,
measured by CellROX®, though this did not reach
statistical significance in Nalm6 cells (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrate that ALL cells
induce oxidative stress in adipocytes, which causes them
to protect the ALL cells from oxidative stress, in turn
promoting resistance to the anthracycline, daunorubicin
(DNR). These findings add to the growing literature
which implicates adipocytes as an active and important
component of the microenvironment of some cancers, such
as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia [3–6, 29]. Since adipocytes are highly prevalent
in the microenvironments of these cancers (breast,
peritoneum, bone marrow), this phenomenon could
contribute to cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy in
patients.
Our results have uncovered a two-way
communication between ALL cells and adipocytes,
apparently initiated by ALL cell induction of oxidative
stress in adipocytes. There is an expanding literature
showing that cancer cells can alter the phenotypes of
cells in their microenvironment, for example by inducing
the development of “cancer-associated fibroblasts”
[30–32]. Some of this interaction may be mediated by

DNR
As a proof of principle, we next tested whether
reduction of ALL cell oxidative stress alone could protect
ALL cells against DNR. Supplementation with high
concentration (20 mM) of GSH significantly increased the
number of viable cells after DNR treatment of BV173,
Nalm6 (Figure 6A), and RS4;11 (data not shown) ALL
cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a GSH precursor, also
protected these cells from DNR (Figure 6B), and was
associated with increased viability assessed by flow

growth in vitro by providing cysteine, which maintains
glutathione levels and results in protection against
oxidative stress [42]. It is possible that adipocytes in bone
marrow and adipose tissue provide similar protection.
While these data suggest that soluble factors mediate
adipocyte protection of ALL cells from oxidative stress,
we have yet to identify which factors are responsible.
Among the top 10 genes upregulated in adipocytes
(Table 1), adrenomedullin (ADM) is a cytokine known to
be secreted by adipocytes [43], and has been shown to play
a role in cell survival in several types of cancer [44]. In our
hands, ADM did not protect 8093 ALL cells from DNR
treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A), and neutralizing
ADM antibodies did not block adipocyte protection of
8093 cells against DNR (Supplementary Figure S1B).
These results excluded ADM as the relevant survival

tumor cell induction of oxidative stress in nearby stromal
cells [33]. Less is known about adipocytes in the cancer
microenvironment, though recent studies have described
“cancer-associated adipocytes”, which exhibit a modified
phenotype and specific biological features [34], such as
delipidation, dedifferentiation, and secretion of specific
adipokines [35, 36]. These effects may be mediated by
soluble factors released by tumor cells [37, 38]. Ours is the
first study to our knowledge to identify this phenomenon
between adipocytes and ALL cells.
Our findings are consistent with other literature
which highlights the importance of oxidative stress to
leukemia cell drug response. Inhibition of the oxidative
stress response has been shown to be cytotoxic and
enhance chemosensitivity of some leukemia cells [39–41].

factor in our experimental system. Other adipocytesecreted factors, such as MMP9 and IL8, have been shown
to have tumor-promoting effects [4]. Therefore, further
investigation is needed to identify which specific factors
are responsible for adipocyte protection of ALL cells.
Another weakness in the current study is that these results
have not been confirmed in primary human ALL cells,
nor in vivo. However, the use of multiple human ALL cell
lines, coupled with our previous results demonstrating the
effects of adipose tissue ex vivo [13], supports the potential
importance of these phenomenon to human ALL.
Along with some of our previous studies [13, 16],
this work highlights the important role of adipocytes in
ALL progression and drug resistance. While adipocyte
protection of ALL cells from oxidative stress is one
potential mechanisms explaining the association between
obesity and poor ALL prognosis [7, 9], there are likely
others. Indeed, we have shown that adipocytes protect
ALL from multiple chemotherapies [16], some of
which do not act through induction of oxidative stress.
In addition, we have found that adipocytes absorb some
chemotherapies [45], including DNR [46], which could

contribute to some of the present results, though would
not explain the protection observed from adipocyte
conditioned media. Thus, adipocyte protection from
oxidative stress should be considered when developing
therapeutic strategies which target oxidative stress in

for hybridization of cDNA. Genes that showed significant
up/down-regulation (p < 0.05 compared to control
conditions) in LCM treated samples were analyzed using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems, www.
ingenuity.com).

All human ALL cell lines (BV173, RS4;11,
and Nalm6) and murine pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 were
from ATCC. Murine pre-B 8093 ALL cells have been
previously described [16]. Chub-S7 (immortalized human
pre-adipose cell line) was from Nestec LTD and cultured
as previously described [47, 48].
All human ALL cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), Glutamax (2 mM),
and gentamicin (10 µg/mL). 8093 cells were cultured in
McCoy’s 5A (Invitrogen), supplemented as above. Fresh
recombinant murine interleukin-3 (Peprotech) and betamercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) were added to 8093 cells
at each passage. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in DMEM high
glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium
pyruvate (1 mM), Glutamax (2 mM), and gentamicin
(10 µg/mL). Chub-S7 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12
(Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate (1 mM),
Glutamax (2 mM), and gentamicin (10 µg/mL). 3T3-L1
(murine) and ChubS7 (human) pre-adipocytes were
differentiated into adipocytes as previously described [48].
Co-culture experiments were performed by seeding
ALL cells in chambers of polycarbonate 0.4 µm pore size
TransWells (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). The TransWells
were inserted in plates containing pre-adipocytes or
adipocytes, such that the ALL cells were not in physical
contact with the feeder cells.
Conditioned media were made with RPMI1640
containing 10% FBS. Leukemia cell conditioned media
(LCM) were made by seeding 200,000 BV173 cells
per mL in culture for 48 hours. Adipocyte conditioned
media (ACM) were made by conditioning 100 µL/cm2
for 48 hours. Adipocyte leukemia cell conditioned media
(ALCM) were made by seeding 200,000 per mL of BV173
in co-culture with a monolayer of adipocytes at 100 µL/cm2.
All media were filtered upon collection using 0.22 µm
syringe filters (Millipore) and stored at −20°C until use,
avoiding freeze-thaw cycles.

Real-time PCR
Cells were collected and stored with RNAProtect
(Qiagen) and lyzed with QIAzol (Qiagen). RNA was
extracted and purified with RNEasy Mini Kits (Qiagen).
The quantity and quality of extracted RNA was measured
by NanoVue (Denville Scientific). Two thousand
nanograms of RNA from each condition were reverse
transcribed to cDNA with a High Capacity 1st Strand
Synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems). The expression of
selected genes was quantified by qPCR using 25 ng of
cDNA, Power SYBR Select PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems), and 200 nM primers designed using National
Center for Biotechnology Information Primer-BLAST
(See Supplementary Table S1 for primer sequences).
Gene expression levels were quantified using the ABI
7900HT Sequence Detection System with the following
thermal profile: 10 minutes at 95°C followed by 40 repeats
of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60 degrees for 1 minute, and a
final dissociation stage of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for
15 seconds, and 95°C for 15 seconds. Transcript levels
were normalized to β-actin. Fold change was calculated
using the ΔΔCt method.

Confocal microscopy
The intracellular ROS assay was done by incubating
cells with 10 µM DCFH-DA for 15 minutes at 37°C and
then washing with cold PBS. Samples were imaged at the
Cellular Imaging Core at the Saban Research Institute of
CHLA. Briefly, DCF fluorescence images were acquired
with an LSM 700 confocal system mounted on an
AxioObserver.Z1 microscope equipped with a 63×/1.4
Plan-APOCHROMAT objective lens and controlled
with ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
Thornwood, NY). A 488 nm laser and 560 nm long-pass
filter were used for fluorescence excitation and emission.
Transmitted laser light was collected to form a DIC image
simultaneously with the fluorescence image. Images were
histogram-stretched in a consistent manner to increase
brightness for publication. Intracellular ROS signals
from the images were quantified using ImageJ (National
Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Gene expression profiling
3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in either LCM
or regular media for 24 hours in biological triplicates.
RNA was extracted and purified using Qiazol reagent and
RNEasy Mini Kits as per the manufacturer’s (Qiagen)
instructions. Microarray hybridization was performed by
the Genome Core facility at the Saban Research Institute
of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). RNA quality
was first assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). RNA was then converted to cDNA with
Superscript Choice for cDNA Synthesis (Invitrogen) and
then converted to biotinylated cDNA using an Enzo High
Yield RNA Transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics).
GeneChip® Mouse Gene ST Array (Affymetrix) was used
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blots
Total protein was extracted from cells using
protein isolation buffer (62.5 mL Tris-HCL, 2% w/v
SDS, 1% v/v Igepal CA-630, 10% glycerol, 0.01 mg/mL
aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride, and
73156

Oncotarget

Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Set II (Calcbiochem)).
Lysates were sonicated briefly and centrifuged for
10 minutes at 15,000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was
retained and protein concentration was quantified by
BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Equal amounts of
protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in
5% milk and then probed with specific primary antibodies.
The secondary antibodies used were HRP-linked. Bands
were detected using a HyGLO-HRP detection kit (Denville
Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ, USA) and developed with
HyBLOT-CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific).
Densitometric band analysis was performed using ImageJ.

REFERENCES

ALL cells were treated with 10 µM DCFH-DA
for 15 minutes at 37°C, then the reaction was stopped by
transferring the cells on ice and protecting from light. Then
DAPI was added to distinguish live cells. The samples
were run at the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Core
at CHLA on LSR II Analyzer from Becton Dickinson (BD).
The PE channel was used to detect intracellular DNR and
the FITC channel for DCF. Proper compensation controls
were used to calculate spill over between PE and FITC
channels. In other experiments where CellROX® Deep Red
Reagent (Life Technologies) was used, the APC channel
was used to detect CellROX®. For apoptosis analysis, ALL
cells were harvested and stained with 25 ng APC-conjugated
Annexin V for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then 50 ng
DAPI was added to stain for late apoptotic/necrotic cells.
The samples were run on the same analyzer above.

Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were performed with Microsoft
Excel 2010. The data are presented as mean ± Standard
Deviation. Experimental groups were compared using
paired, two-sided t-tests; non-normally distributed data
was log-transformed prior to t-test. A p value of less than
0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Flow cytometry
of intracellular DNR and DCF were quantified using
median fluorescence intensity (MFI). MFI was calculated
by dividing sample fluorescence signals by the control
signal. All experiments were performed in triplicates and
repeated at least three times. All graphs are presented as
mean ± SD.
