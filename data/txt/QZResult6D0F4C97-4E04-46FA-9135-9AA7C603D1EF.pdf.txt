Abstract
Curcumin is the active component of tumeric, and this
polyphenolic compound has been extensively investigated as
an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and
genes. In this study, 10 to 25 Mmol/L curcumin inhibited
253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cell growth, and this was
accompanied by induction of apoptosis and decreased
expression of the proapoptotic protein survivin and the
angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Because expression
of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 are dependent on specificity
protein (Sp) transcription factors, we also investigated the
effects of curcumin on Sp protein expression as an underlying
mechanism for the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of
this compound. The results show that curcumin induced
proteasome-dependent down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4
in 253JB-V and KU7 cells. Moreover, using RNA interference
with small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we observed
that curcumin-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor KB
(NF-KB)–dependent genes, such as bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin
D1, was also due, in part, to loss of Sp proteins. Curcumin also
decreased bladder tumor growth in athymic nude mice
bearing KU7 cells as xenografts and this was accompanied
by decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein levels in tumors.
These results show for the first time that one of the underlying
mechanisms of action of curcumin as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to decreased expression of
Sp transcription factors in bladder cancer cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Phytochemicals, microbial metabolites, and other natural
products and their synthetic analogues have been extensively used
for drug development and treatment of various diseases, including
cancer (1, 2). Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a polyphenolic
natural product and the active component of tumeric (Curcuma
species), which is used in cooking and in traditional medicines
(3–5). Curcumin has been extensively investigated as an anticancer
drug in various cancer cells and laboratory animal models.
Curcumin has also been evaluated in humans, and one of the
major problems associated with clinical applications of curcumin

is the low bioavailability (6–10). The effects of curcumin in various
tumor models is highly variable and dependent on both tumor type
and cell context. In many studies, curcumin inhibits cancer cell
proliferation, induces apoptosis, and inhibits angiogenesis (11–20).
Mechanisms associated with these effects are variable and may
involve direct effects on mitochondria, activation of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, and modulation of kinase pathways
including the inhibition of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB).
Recent studies reported that curcumin decreased survival of
RT4V6 and KU7 bladder cancer cells and this was accompanied by
increased DNA fragmentation and other parameters associated
with apoptosis (17). In addition, there was also evidence that
curcumin potentiated the effects of other drugs and cytokines in
bladder cancer cells and this has been observed in other studies
(16, 17, 21, 22). Curcumin alone had minimal effects on NF-nB in
RT4V6 or KU7 cells; however, in cells treated with agents, such as
gemcitabine, tumor necrosis factor, and cigarette smoke, that
induce NF-nB, cotreatment with curcumin inhibited NF-nB
activation. It was concluded that suppression of induced NF-nB
by curcumin may play a role in sensitizing bladder cancer cells and
other cancer cell lines to various chemotherapeutic agents (17).
Betulinic acid is a triterpenoid natural product that inhibits
growth of multiple cancer cell lines, and this compound induces
apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis (23). Studies in this laboratory
showed that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of this
compound in prostate cancer cells was the targeted degradation of
specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3, and Sp4 and Sp-dependent genes
involved in cell growth, survival, and angiogenesis (24). We also
observed similar effects for the analgesic tolfenamic acid (25, 26),
and RNA interference studies with small inhibitory RNAs (siRNA)
for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 confirmed the role of these proteins in
regulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and survivin and repression of
p27 by Sp3 (26–30).
Curcumin induced apoptosis and inhibited KU7 and 253JB-V
bladder cancer cell proliferation, and we hypothesized that
curcumin may also affect Sp protein expression in these cells.
Curcumin decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein expression in the
bladder cancer cell lines; similar results were observed in tumors in
a xenograft study. These results show that the curcumin-induced
growth-inhibitory, proapoptotic, and angiogenic responses in
bladder cancer cells and tumors are due, in part, to decreased
expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. Moreover, curcumin-induced
down-regulation of Sp proteins also plays a role in the effects of
curcumin as an inhibitor of NF-nB–dependent genes.

Collection and 253JB-V cells were provided by Dr. A. Kamat (M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and maintained essentially as described (17).
With the exception of cleaved poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP; Cell
Signaling Technology), NF-nB-p65 (Abcam, Inc.), and h-actin antibodies
(Sigma-Aldrich), all remaining antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Curcumin (98% pure) was purchased from Indofine
Chemical Company, Inc. Lipofectamine and Lipofectamine 2000 were
purchased from Invitrogen. h-Galactosidase reagent was obtained from
Tropix.
Cell proliferation assays. Bladder cancer cells (3  104 per well) were
plated using DMEM:Ham’s F-12 medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped
fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 12-well plates and left to attach for 24 h. Cells
were then treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated concentrations of curcumin. Fresh medium and test compounds were added every
48 h, and cells were then counted at the indicated times using a Coulter Z1
particle counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate and results are
expressed as means F SE for each determination.
Terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end
labeling assay. 253JB-V and KU7 cells (7  104) were seeded in fourchambered glass slides and left overnight to attach. After curcumin
treatment for 12 h, the in situ cell death detection POD kit was used for the
terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assay according to the instructions in the protocol manual for
fixed cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by counting the
stained cells in eight fields, each containing 50 cells. The total number of
apoptotic cells was plotted as a percentage in both cell lines.
Transfection and luciferase assays. Bladder cancer cells (1  105 per
well) were plated in 12-well plates in DMEM:Ham’s F-12 medium
supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After 16 h, various amounts
of DNA (i.e., 0.4 Ag pGL3/pGL2-Luc; 0.04 Ag h-galactosidase; and 0.4 Ag
pSp1For4-Luc, pSp3For5-Luc, pVEGF-Luc, pNFnB-Luc, and pSurvivin-Luc)
were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol and luciferase activity (normalized to h-galactosidase) was
determined essentially as described (24–29).
Western blot assays. Bladder cancer cells were seeded in DMEM:Ham’s
F-12 medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS. Twenty-four hours
later, cells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated
compounds for 24 h and Western blot analysis was determined as described
(26–29). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were separated using NE-PER
nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). The tumor tissues
were also processed similarly and probed for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins and
h-actin served as loading control. Protein quantification used Image J
software, and optical densities for each protein was normalized to h-actin
in the iLamin-treated group.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting assays. Both 253JB-V and KU7
bladder cancer cells were treated with either the vehicle (DMSO) or the
indicated compounds for 24 h. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer using CellQuest acquisition software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence was collected
through a 585/42 nm band pass filter, and list mode data were acquired on a
minimum of 20,000 single cells defined by a dot plot of PI width versus PI
area. Data analysis was performed using Modfit LT software (Verity Software
House, Topsham, ME).
siRNA interference assays. siRNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 were prepared
by Dharmacon RNA Technologies. The iRNA complexes used in this study

The triple Sp siRNA knockdown (iSp1, iSp3, iSp4 complex) along with
iLamin as control was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection
reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA for p65 and p50 and NC
were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cells were rinsed in cold PBS
buffer and harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After 15-min
incubation on ice and 10-min centrifugation at 16,000  g, 4jC, the pellet
was resuspended in reporter lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 mol/L KCl
and incubated on ice for 30 min. The supernatant containing nuclear
proteins was collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000  g, 4jC and
quantified for protein concentrations by Bradford method. The GC-rich
probe was prepared by annealing the two complementary polynucleotides:
5¶-CTCGTCGGCCCCCGCCCCTCT-3¶ and 5¶-AGAGGGGCGGGGGCCGACGAG-3¶. The NF-nB sense strand probe was 5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶. The annealed probe was 5¶-end–labeled using T4 polynucleotide
kinase (Invitrogen) and [g-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer). The labeled probe was
purified with the Chroma Spin TE-10 column (BD Biosciences). The
electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction was carried out in the reporter
lysis buffer (Promega) supplemented with 0.1 mol/L KCl. Each reaction
contained 2 Ag nuclear protein, 500 to 1,000 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals) with or without unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides, and 10 fmol of labeled probe; the mixture was incubated for
15 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5% native PAGE
at 160 V at room temperature for 1.5 h and visualized using a Storm A60
PhosphoImager system (Molecular Dynamics).
Xenograft study. Female athymic nude mice, age 4 to 6 weeks, were
purchased from Harlan. KU7 cells (1  106) in 1:1 ratio of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were injected into the either side of the flank area of nude
mice. Seven days after the tumor cell inoculation, mice were divided into
two groups of 10 animals each. The first group received 50 AL vehicle (corn
oil) by i.p. injection, and the second group of animals received 50 mg/kg/d
injection of curcumin in corn oil every 2nd day for 18 d (9 doses) by i.p.
injection. The mice were weighed, and tumor areas were measured
throughout the study. After 20 d, the animals were sacrificed; final body and
tumor weights were determined and plotted.

Results
Figure 1A and B illustrates the concentration-dependent effects of
5, 10, and 25 Amol/L curcumin on proliferation of 253JB-V and KU7
bladder cancer cells over a 6-day period with change of medium
and treatment with DMSO (control) or curcumin every 48 h.
Proliferation of both 253JB-V and KU7 cells was inhibited by
curcumin. However, the pattern of inhibition was slightly different;
5 and 10 Amol/L curcumin significantly inhibited 253JB-V cells after
treatment for 4 and 6 days, whereas 10 Amol/L (but not 5 Amol/L)
curcumin significantly inhibited KU7 cell proliferation after
treatment for 2, 4, and 6 days. The highest concentration of
curcumin (25 Amol/L) was cytotoxic to both cell lines, and similar
results were previously reported on the cytotoxicity of curcumin in
KU7 and RT4V6 bladder cancer cells (17). The effects of curcumin on
the distribution of 253JB-V and KU7 cells in G0-G1, S, and M phases of
the cell cycle are illustrated in Fig. 1C and D, respectively. Curcumin
(5–25 Amol/L) increased the percentage of 253JB-V cells in G0-G1 and
decreased the percentage in S and G2-M phases, although the effects
on G2-M were concentration dependent and variable. In contrast, in
KU7 cells, minimal effects were observed after treatment with 5 or
10 Amol/L curcumin, whereas 25 Amol/L curcumin decreased the
percentage of cells in G0-G1 and increased the percentage in S and
G2-M phases (Fig. 1D). These results show that curcumin-induced
changes in the distribution of 253JB-V and KU7 cells in different
phases of the cycle were dependent on cell context.
The effects of curcumin on selected proteins involved in cell
cycle progression are summarized in Fig. 2A. The cyclin-dependent

for 24 h; the distribution of cells in G0-G1, S,

kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 were decreased in both cell lines by
curcumin, but at different concentrations. p21 was decreased by
25 to 50 Amol/L and 10 to 50 Amol/L curcumin in 253JB-V and KU7
cells, respectively, whereas 25 to 50 Amol/L curcumin decreased
p27 expression in both cell lines. The role of these responses in
mediating the distribution of bladder cancer cells in different
phases of the cell cycle is unclear. Previous studies showed that
curcumin induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells (17) and, in
pancreatic tumors, curcumin suppressed proliferation and
inhibited angiogenesis (13, 16). Results in Fig. 2B show that
curcumin induced PARP cleavage in 253JB-V and KU7 cells, and
this was also accompanied by down-regulation of the antiapoptotic
gene survivin. Decreased survivin and increased PARP cleavage
were initially observed at curcumin concentrations of 10 and
25 Amol/L in 253JB-V and KU7 cells, respectively, and maximal
responses were observed in cells treated with 25 and 50 Amol/L
curcumin. In addition, curcumin also decreased expression of two
angiogenic proteins, VEGF and VEGFR1, in both cell lines (Fig. 2B).
The proapoptotic activity of curcumin was also confirmed in a
TUNEL assay (Fig. 2C) where 40 Amol/L curcumin induced
increased TUNEL staining in 253JB-V and KU7 cells, whereas
minimal effects were observed in the solvent (DMSO)–treated cells.
Results in Fig. 3A and B show that after treatment of 253JB-V
and KU7 cells with curcumin (5–50 Amol/L) for 24 hours, there was
a concentration-dependent decrease in the expression of Sp1,
Sp3, and Sp4 proteins. Curcumin-induced down-regulation of Sp
proteins was dependent on the concentration of curcumin, Sp
protein (i.e., Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4), and cell context. However, in both
253JB-V and KU7 cells, decreased expression of all three proteins
was observed after treatment with 10 Amol/L and higher
concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours. Because curcumin
decreased expression of Sp1-, Sp3-, Sp4-, and Sp-dependent
survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 proteins, we also investigated the

www.aacrjournals.org

effects of curcumin on luciferase activity in 253JB-V and KU7 cells
transfected with constructs containing GC-rich promoters that
bind Sp proteins. Luciferase activity was decreased in 253JB-V and
KU7 cells treated with 10 to 40 Amol/L curcumin and transfected
with GC-rich Sp1For4 and Sp3For5 constructs containing the 751
to 20 and 417 to 38 regions of the Sp1 and Sp3 gene
promoters, respectively (refs. 31, 32; linked to the luciferase gene;
Fig. 3C). In addition, curcumin (10–40 Amol/L) also decreased
luciferase activity in 253JB-V and KU7 cells transfected with GCrich pVEGF and pSurvivin constructs that contain the 2018 to
+50 and 269 to +49 GC-rich regions of the VEGF and survivin
gene promoters, respectively (Fig. 3D). Thus, like tolfenamic acid
and betulinic acid, curcumin-induced down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3,
and Sp4 not only decreased expression of Sp-regulated proteins,
such as VEGF and survivin, but also decreased transactivation in
253JB-V and KU7 cells transfected with pVEGF and pSurvivin
constructs containing GC-rich promoter inserts.
Previous studies show that tolfenamic and betulinic acids induce
proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in
pancreatic and prostate cancer cells (24, 25), and Fig. 4A and B
summarize the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on
curcumin-induced down-regulation of these proteins. In KU7 cells,
MG132 inhibited curcumin-induced down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3,
and Sp4 proteins, and similar effects were observed in 253JB-V cells.
However, in the latter bladder cancer cell line, MG132 alone also
decreased Sp protein expression and this response was most
pronounced for Sp1. Other proteasome inhibitors such as
lactacystin and gliotoxin gave similar results and, in combination
with curcumin, high cytotoxicity was observed in 253JB-V cells
(data not shown). Nevertheless, it was apparent that MG132 plus
curcumin blocked Sp protein down-regulation in both cell lines,
suggesting that curcumin, like betulinic and tolfenamic acids
(24–26), induced proteasome-dependent down-regulation of Sp1,

Sp3, and Sp4 proteins in 253JB-V and KU7 cells. Figure 4C
summarizes the effects of MG132 on curcumin-dependent
decreased luciferase activity in 253JB-V and KU7 cells transfected
with pSp1For4 and pSp3For5. In 253JB-V cells, MG132 only partially
reversed down-regulation of activity by 25 Amol/L curcumin,
whereas in KU7 cells, MG132 completely inhibited the effects of
curcumin on luciferase activity. The relative effectiveness of MG132
as an inhibitor of curcumin-dependent down-regulation of
luciferase activity in cells transfected with pVEGF or pSurvivin
also differed in 253JB-V and KU7 cells (Fig. 4D). MG132 reversed the
effects of curcumin in KU7 cells (80–100%) but was less efficient in
253JB-V cells. This may be due, in part, to the cytotoxicity of MG132
alone and in combination with curcumin in 253JB-V cells. These
results show that curcumin primarily induced proteasomedependent degradation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in the bladder cancer
cells, and similar effects have been observed for tolfenamic acid
and betulinic acid in pancreatic and prostate cancer cells (24, 25).
Previous studies in bladder and other cancer cell lines report
that the broad spectrum of anticancer activities of curcumin have
been associated, in part, with decreased NF-nB–dependent activity
(3, 4). Results illustrated in Fig. 5A show that 10 to 40 Amol/L
curcumin decreased luciferase activity in 253JB-V cells transfected
with pNFnB, a construct containing five tandem NF-nB response
elements that regulate a luciferase reporter gene. Thus, curcumin

decreases NF-nB–dependent transactivation in the 253JB-V cell
line. Because curcumin also decreases expression of Sp1, Sp3, and
Sp4 in bladder cancer cells, we investigated the effects of Sp protein
knockdown on luciferase activity in cells transfected with pNFnBluc (Fig. 5B). 253JB-V and KU7 cells were transfected with iSp,
which is a cocktail of siRNAs for Sp1 (iSp1), Sp3 (iSp3), and Sp4
(iSp4; ref. 33). The results showed that transfection with iSp
significantly inhibited NF-nB–dependent activity and this was not
directly related to a decrease in p65 or p50 protein levels after
transfection with iSp (Fig. 5B). There was a minimal but not
significant decrease in these proteins over replicated experiments,
suggesting that decreased NF-nB–dependent transactivation by iSp
was not dependent on decreased expression of p65 or p50. We also
investigated the effects of iSp1, iSp3, and iSp4 on p65 and p50
protein expression in 253JB-V and KU7 cells (Supplement 1). In the
former cell line, iSp3 and iSp4 (but not iSp1) slightly decreased p65
protein levels, whereas none of the siRNAs affected p65 or p50
expression in KU7 cells and p50 expression in 253JB-V cells.
Figure 5C shows that curcumin decreased expression of cyclin D1
and the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 in 253JB-V and KU7 cells, and
both of these genes are also regulated by NF-nB and Sp
transcription factors (34, 35). It is possible that curcumin-induced
down-regulation of Sp proteins may directly affect NF-nB because
both p65 and p50 are Sp-dependent genes in some cell lines

Curcumin Decreases Sp Proteins in Bladder Cancer Cells

Figure 3. Effects of curcumin on Sp
proteins and Sp-dependent transactivation.
Curcumin decreases Sp proteins in
253JB-V (A) and KU7 (B) bladder cancer
cells. Cells were treated with DMSO and
5, 10, 25, or 50 Amol/L curcumin for
24 h and whole-cell lysates were analyzed
by Western blot analysis as described in

observed in duplicate experiments.
Curcumin decreases luciferase activity in

concentrations of curcumin, and luciferase
activity was determined as described in

(36, 37). However, treatment of 253JB-V and KU7 cells with DMSO
and 10, 25, or 40 Amol/L curcumin for 24 hours did not affect
nuclear p65 expression, whereas nuclear p50 protein levels were
decreased only at the higher (40 Amol/L) concentration (Fig. 5D)
and 25 Amol/L curcumin, which decreases Sp protein levels, did
not affect p65 or p50 expression. Thus, curcumin-mediated
inhibition of NF-nB–dependent gene expression is not due to
direct effects on p65 or p50.
A close inspection of many NF-nB–regulated genes, such as
cyclin D1, bcl-2, survivin, and VEGF, indicates that these genes also
contain multiple GC-rich promoter sequences and are coregulated
by Sp proteins in many cell lines (24–28, 34, 35, 37–40). Results in
Fig. 6A show that in 253JB-V and KU7 cells transfected with iLamin
(control) or the iSp cocktail (containing iSp1, iSp3, and iSp4), there
was a significant decrease in levels of bcl-2, cyclin D1, survivin, and
VEGF and this correlated with the effects of curcumin on these
same proteins (Figs. 2B and 5C). In contrast, combined knockdown
of p65 and p50 by RNA interference (Fig. 6B) did not affect
expression of all these proteins. Only VEGF and bcl-2 proteins were
decreased by p65/p50 knockdown, suggesting that basal expression
of cyclin D1 and survivin were NF-nB independent in the bladder
cancer cells. Figure 6C illustrates gel mobility shift assays in which
nuclear extracts from 253JB-V and KU7 cells bound a 32P-labeled
GC-rich oligonucleotide to form Sp-DNA retarded bands as
previously characterized in other cell lines (27–29). Treatment
with 25 or 40 Amol/L curcumin decreased retarded band intensities
and coincubation with unlabeled wild-type GC-rich or mutant

www.aacrjournals.org

oligonucleotides decreased or did not affect retarded band
intensities, respectively (Fig. 6C). Supershift experiments with Sp1
antibodies did not give a defined supershifted antibody-protein
complex but a diffuse band. However, the Sp1 band intensity was
decreased due to immunodepletion. We also determined the effects
of curcumin on NF-nB–DNA binding in a gel mobility shift assay
using a consensus NF-nB response element and extracts from
cells, and the results showed that curcumin decreased retarded
band intensities associated with the NF-nB–DNA complex (Supplement 2). These data confirm that curcumin decreases Sp
proteins and Sp-DNA complex formation and the NF-nB–DNA
retarded band and this correlated with decreased expression of
NF-nB–regulated proteins that are also coregulated by Sp transcription factors. These factors suggest that curcumin-dependent
down-regulation of Sp proteins contributes to decreased expression
of several NF-nB–dependent proteins, which are coregulated by
both Sp and NF-nB transcription factors (24–28, 34, 35, 37–40).
We also investigated the antitumorigenic activity of curcumin
in athymic nude mice bearing KU7 cells as xenografts. At a dose
of 50 mg/kg/d, curcumin significantly decreased tumor volumes
and tumor weights (Fig. 6D). Moreover, Western blot analysis of
tumor lysates from three control and three treated mice show
that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein expression is decreased in the
latter group. These results complement the in vitro studies and
show that curcumin-induced effects on Sp proteins also plays a
role in the mechanism of action of this compound in bladder
cancer cells.

Discussion
Curcumin has been widely used in traditional medicines, and its
chemoprotective and chemotherapeutic effects are due to many
different activities that are also dependent on cell context (3–5).
One of the most predominant effects of curcumin observed in
many studies is associated with inhibition of constitutive or
induced NF-nB–dependent genes/proteins associated with cell
survival, angiogenesis, and inflammation (3–5, 33, 41–43). However,
other pathways contribute to the effects of curcumin, and these
may be NF-nB independent. For example, curcumin induces ER
stress in human leukemia HL-60 cells, and this results in activation
of ER stress–dependent proapoptotic pathways associated with
cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-4 (18). In
addition, curcumin-induced apoptosis in human leukemia U937
cells was also linked to the direct effects of this compound on
mitochondria function and subsequent activation of the intrinsic
apoptosis pathway (44).
Recent studies in this laboratory have shown that compounds
such as celecoxib, tolfenamic acid, and betulinic acid inhibit cancer
cell and tumor growth and metastasis, and exhibit both
antiangiogenic and proapoptotic activity through decreased
expression of Sp proteins such as Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (25–27). The
role of Sp proteins in mediating these responses was consistent
with RNA interference studies showing that Sp proteins regulate
angiogenic, growth-promoting, and prosurvival genes in cancer
cells (28–30). Results in Fig. 1 illustrate that curcumin decreased
proliferation of bladder cancer cells and induced apoptosis as
evidenced by induction of PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B) and DNA

laddering (Fig. 2C) in 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cells. These
results are consistent with a report (17) showing that curcumin
exhibited growth inhibitory and proapoptotic activity in KU7 and
RT4V6 bladder cancer cells. In the prior study (17), 10 Amol/L
curcumin slightly inhibited G0-G1 to S phase progression in KU7
cells, whereas our results showed that 10 Amol/L curcumin
inhibited G0-G1 to S phase progression in 253JB-V but not in
KU7 cells, which were essentially unaffected by 10 Amol/L
curcumin (Fig. 1C and D). Differences in the effects of curcumin
on cell cycle progression in these cell lines may be due, in part, to
the effects of curcumin on p21, p27, and cyclin D1 expression
(Figs. 2A and 5C), and this is currently being investigated.
Curcumin also decreased expression of the angiogenic proteins
VEGF and VEGFR1 in both bladder cancer cell lines, and decreased
expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin was accompanied
by induction of caspase-dependent PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B) and
increased staining in the TUNEL assay (Fig. 2C). This evidence for
activation of apoptosis by curcumin is consistent with previous
studies on this compound in bladder and other cancer cell lines
(3–5, 12–18). However, the coordinate decrease in expression of
survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 in bladder cancer cells treated with
curcumin was reminiscent of similar effects observed in prostate
and pancreatic cancer cells treated with betulinic acid and
tolfenamic acid, respectively (24–26). In those studies, it was
shown that decreased expression of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1
was due to degradation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, which are known to
regulate basal expression of survivin, VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2
(27–30, 38–40). Results summarized in Fig. 3 illustrate that
treatment of 253JB-V and KU7 cells with curcumin caused a

concentration-dependent decrease in Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein
expression. The Sp1 and Sp3 promoters contain GC-rich motifs
that bind Sp proteins (31, 32), and curcumin inhibited transactivation in 253JB-V and KU7 cells transfected with constructs
(pSp1For4 and pSp3For5) containing Sp1 and Sp3 gene promoter
inserts (Fig. 3C). Sp proteins also regulate expression of survivin
and VEGF (38–40), and curcumin decreased luciferase activity in
bladder cancer cells transfected with pVEGF and pSurvivin.

Betulinic acid– and tolfenamic acid–induced down-regulation
of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in prostate and pancreatic cancer cells is due
to activation of proteasomes, and these are blocked by the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 (24–26). This same inhibitor inhibited
curcumin-induced down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins
in 253JB-V and KU7 cells (Fig. 4A and B), and similar effects were
observed in cells transfected with pS1For4, pSp3For5, pVEGF, and
pSurvivin and treated with curcumin plus MG132 (Fig. 4C and D).

MG132 and other proteasome inhibitors such as gliotoxin and
lactacystin were cytotoxic to 253JB-V cells, and MG132 alone
decreased Sp1 protein in this cell line. However, despite these
effects, our results show that curcumin-dependent down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins was partially reversed in 253JB-V
cells cotreated with curcumin plus MG132. Moreover, similar
results were observed in the transfection studies (Fig. 4C and D),
suggesting that curcumin-dependent down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3,
and Sp4 in KU7 and 253JB-V cells was primarily due to activation of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

the proteasome pathway. These results suggest that some of the
proapoptotic and antiangiogenic activities of curcumin in bladder
cancer cells are due, in part, to degradation of Sp proteins and
Sp-dependent survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1.
In cancer cells and tumors, NF-nB regulates expression of
prosurvival and angiogenic genes, and the efficacy of several
chemotherapeutic agents, including curcumin, has also been linked
to their inhibition of NF-nB–mediated responses (3–5, 11, 16, 17).
Inhibition of NF-nB by curcumin has been associated with

modulation of multiple pathways; however, the effects of
curcumin-dependent down-regulation of Sp proteins on NF-nB
has not been determined. p65 and p50/105 are regulated by Sp1 in
some cell lines (36, 45), and our results show that concentrations of
curcumin that decreased NF-nB–dependent activity (V25 Amol/L)
did not affect nuclear p65 or p50 levels in KU7 or 253JB-V cells
(Fig. 5D). Moreover, in KU7 and 253JB-V cells transfected with the
iSp cocktail containing siRNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, there was also
only a minimal decrease in expression of p65 or p50 (Fig. 5B).
Curcumin decreased expression of several NF-nB–dependent
genes, including VEGF, survivin, bcl-2, and cyclin D1 (Figs. 2B
and 5C; refs. 24, 26, 28, 29, 34, 35, 37–40), and similar results were
observed in bladder cancer cells transfected with iSp (Fig. 6A).
Because curcumin decreases both Sp proteins and NF-nB–
dependent transactivation in bladder cancer cells, the role of NFnB in mediating these responses was investigated by p65 and p50
knockdown (Fig. 6B). Only VEGF and bcl-2 were decreased in both
cell lines after transfection with siRNAs for p65 and p50
(combined). This suggests that curcumin-induced effects on
bcl-2, cyclin D1, VEGF, and survivin expression are primarily due
to Sp down-regulation; however, the contribution of Sp proteins
and NF-nB on regulation of these gene products are gene and cell
context dependent although their promoters contain both GC-rich
and NF-nB elements (24, 26, 28, 29, 34, 35, 37–40).
We also examined the in vivo activity of curcumin (50 mg/kg/d)
in athymic nude mice bearing KU7 cells as xenografts (Fig. 6D).
Curcumin inhibited tumor growth and weight and this corresponded to parallel effects in 253JB-V and KU7 cells (Fig. 1A and B)
where curcumin inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, curcumininduced effects on Sp protein expression in bladder cancer cells
(Fig. 3A and B) were also observed in bladder tumors (Fig. 6D),

demonstrating that curcumin-dependent Sp protein degradation is
an integral part of the anticancer activity of this compound in
bladder cancer cells and tumors.
In summary, results of this study show for the first time that
curcumin induces proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp1, Sp3,
and Sp4 in bladder cancer cell lines, and this is accompanied by
decreased expression of Sp-dependent survival and angiogenic
proteins. The results suggest that at least some of the important
anticancer activities of curcumin may be due, in part, to decreased
expression of Sp proteins. A recent study (46) reported that
curcumin decreased Sp1 protein expression in pancreatic cancer
cells and this was related to increased microRNA-22, which directly
targets Sp1 but not Sp3 or Sp4. Because curcumin induces
proteasome-dependent degradation of all three Sp proteins in
bladder cancer cells, the mechanism of curcumin action clearly
differs in pancreatic and bladder cancer cells. Current studies are
focused on the cancer cell context–dependent differences in the
contributions and mechanisms of action of curcumin-dependent
down-regulation of Sp proteins on the overall activity of this
compound as an anticancer agent.
