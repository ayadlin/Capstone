Phase 1 studies in cancer have changed in recent years. Now, with the advent of new, less toxic, targeted
agents, more patients may be candidates for new drug studies earlier in the course of their disease. It is to
the advantage of the members of the oncology community to know more regarding the details and
requirements for participation in early-phase clinical trials so they can advocate for their patients and help
them decide when such trials may be an appropriate choice. To examine the work intensity of early phase
cancer clinical trials, the authors of this report compared the study requirements of phase 1 and 2 protocols. Five parameters were studied as a surrogate of study complexity—the number of physical examinations, vital sign determinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), nonpharmacokinetic laboratory tests, and
pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling—in the first 4 weeks of protocol in 90 studies (49 phase 1 studies and 41
phase 2 studies). From July 2004 through March 2007, there were 49 phase 1 trials in the phase 1 Program,
9 phase 2 studies that were conducted by physicians appointed in that program, and 32 phase 2 trials with
accessible data in the Department of Thoracic/Head & Neck Medical Oncology. In the phase 1 trials versus
the phase 2 trials, there were significantly more (P < .05) physical examinations (mean  standard error,
3.16  0.24 vs 2.22  0.13), vital sign determinations (5.63  0.61 vs 2.80  0.26), ECGs (4.36  1.16 vs
0.80  0.17), nonpharmacokinetic laboratory tests (18.08  1.31 vs 10.12  0.65), and PK sampling (15.14  1.79
vs 1.02  0.53). These values also differed significantly (P < .005 for each) when the median values were
compared in nonparametric tests. Although both phase 1 and phase 2 trials had substantial study requirements, those for the phase 1 studies were significantly higher. The successful conduct of early-phase clinical

used, the standard design in phase 1 studies is to enroll
cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at increasing dose levels until
dose-limiting toxicity is reached.2-5 Traditionally, the primary endpoints of phase 1 studies of chemotherapy
included determining the pharmacokinetics of the drug6
as well as the maximum tolerated dose7 and subsequent
recommendations of a dose and schedule with which to
proceed to phase 2 studies. In contrast to phase 1 trials,
the primary endpoint for phase 2 studies is efficacy. However, for newer, targeted agents, other endpoints for phase
1 trials, such as the optimal biologic dose (eg, the dose at
which the target is modulated best), increasingly are
becoming important along with describing response signals and any early evidence of a correlation between these
signals and target inhibition and/or patient/tumor characteristics.8,9 These endpoints are more complex to obtain,
because they require measuring target impact in tumor tissue and/or assessing genomic expression patterns in the
host or the tumor.10,11 In addition, over the last decade,
there has been increasing scrutiny of clinical trials research
with an emphasis on tight adherence to protocol requirements as well as careful monitoring of patient safety.12-14
All of these factors have contributed to the impression
that phase 1 trials have become increasingly complex.
Much has been written concerning the risks and
benefits15-17 and the design and importance of phase 1 trials1-3 as well as the cost of clinical trials versus standard
care.18-25 There also is literature regarding the work
involved in clinical research, but mostly with regard to
phase 2 and 3 protocols.19,26 Until now, little has been
done to examine the intensity of the phase 1 protocol
schedule. This information is important, because the intensity of phase 1 trials impacts both the patient and the
clinical research staff. In the current study, we analyzed a
series of phase 1 and 2 trials conducted at M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center to further examine and compare the work
intensity required for the 2 different phases of clinical
research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protocol Selection
The requirements for all phase 1 and 2 protocols managed
by the Phase 1 Program or by physicians with an appointment in that program at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,

as well as the phase 2 protocols with accessible data managed by the Department of Thoracic/Head & Neck Medical Oncology during fiscal years 2003 through 2007 were
reviewed. (For the phase 1 trials, only studies that were
approved by the Internal Review Board and that had accessible data were analyzed. The time frame for these studies was July 2004 through March, 2007.) After the
exclusion of 7 trials (5 were phase 1 trials, and 2 were
phase 2 trials) because of either past closure or inaccessible
data, 49 phase 1 trials and 41 phase 2 trials remained for
investigation. Each trial and its requirements were
reviewed by tabulating data from the Clinical and Translational Research Center database, the institution’s Protocol Document Online System, the M. D. Andersonmandated protocol abstract, and/or the protocol order
sets. All trials had been approved by the Institutional
Review Board. In preparing this report, we obtained protocol requirements from sources that contained no
patient-specific information.

Correlative Studies and Data Collection
We analyzed several parameters as representatives of the
complexity of requirements. These included 1) physical
examination, 2) vital sign monitoring, 3) electrocardiography monitoring, 4) nonpharmacokinetic (non-PK) laboratory testing, and 5) and pharmacokinetic (PK)
sampling conducted in the first 28-day cycle of each protocol. To evaluate our findings, we developed a comprehensive database along with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
matrix to analyze the number of correlative studies.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical objectives of this study included comparison of differences in each of the 5 variables (physical
examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms [ECGs],
non-PK laboratory draws, and PK time points) by 1)
phase of study (ie, phase 1 vs phase 2), 2) sponsorship
within phase (industry, nonsponsored/investigator-initiated, National Cancer Institute [NCI]/peer-reviewed
group), and 3) sponsorship (industry, nonsponsored/
investigator-initiated, NCI/peer-reviewed group). All statistical analyses were performed by our biostatistician (X.L.).
Summary statistics were used to report the number
of observations and the mean, standard deviation,

were implemented. If the number of groups for comparison was 2, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. If
the number of groups for comparison was >2, then the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used. P values were reported, and
differences between protocol phase and sponsor were considered statistically significant if the P value for a given

in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
We reviewed a total of 90 trials, including 49 phase 1 trials
and 41 phase 2 trials, that were approved and managed
during the same period. The parameters were those
assessed during the first 4 weeks of the study. For all correlative tests that we investigated, there were significantly
more tests required in phase 1 trials than in phase 2 trials
(Table 1). Physical examination time points differed
between the 2 groups, with significantly more required in
phase 1 (mean  standard error, 3.16  0.24 time points
vs 2.22  0.13 time points). The number of vital sign

measurements differed significantly between phase 1 and
2, with a greater mean number required in phase 1
(5.63  0.61 vital sign measurements vs 2.80  0.26 vital
sign measurements). For ECGs, the mean number also
was significantly greater in phase 1 trials versus phase 2 trials (4.36  1.16 ECGs vs 0.80  0.18 ECGs). The mean
number of non-PK laboratory draws also differed between
phase 1 and phase 2 (18.08  1.31 non-PK laboratory
draws vs 10.12  0.65 non-PK laboratory draws). Very
noteworthy was the difference in the mean number of PK
samplings between phase 1 trials (15.14  1.79) and
phase 2 trials (1.02  0.53). These parameters also differed significantly (P < .005) for each when the median
values were compared using nonparametric tests. Therefore, in the current study, although while both phases of
clinical trials required significant numbers of correlatives,
the requirements for phase 1 were considerably greater.
Similar to previous studies that investigated work
requirements,26 we also looked at how the sponsorship of
different trials affected the number of requirements (Table 2). Of the phase 1 trials, 38 of 49 were industry-sponsored trials, 8 of 49 were nonsponsored/investigatorinitiated trials, and 3 of 49 were NCI-sponsored trials. Of
the phase 2 trials, 19 of 41 were industry sponsored, 6 of
41 were nonsponsored/investigator initiated, and 16 of 41
were NCI/Department of Defense or other peer-review
group sponsored. (Trials that were investigator initiated
but were funded by a sponsor who held the investigational
new drug are listed as industry sponsored or NCI sponsored). Among the phase 1 trials, as noted previously,
78% were sponsored by private industry, and only 6%
had NCI or peer-reviewed sponsorship—a trend we have
witnessed for several years. This limited number of phase
1 NCI studies precluded an analysis of sponsorship within
each of the phase 1 and phase 2 trials. In that context, for

However, our sense was that NCI trials, when controlled

DISCUSSION
New drug development is essential for making progress in
the treatment of cancer. During the last few years, concern
for patient safety in clinical trials has resulted in strict
1595

Review Article

regulatory requirements.12-14 In addition, with the advent
of targeted agents, correlative studies to understand pharmacodynamic effects and target impact have become crucial to optimal drug development.6 These requirements
have resulted in the impression of a greater workload
assumed by investigators and institutions participating in
early-phase clinical trials.
Because there are few data on this aspect of study
conduct for phase 1 protocols, our analysis focused on
them. And, although many activities are required to run a
successful phase 1 clinical trial, including the workload of
clinical study coordinators, imaging, etc, we did not specifically address those activities. Instead, we chose to
examine a set of 5 requirements of current, successful,
early-phase cancer clinical trials. We chose these variables
because of their prevalence and importance in phase 1
studies. For instance, determining PK is often a primary
endpoint.6 With more targeted agents being developed,
the strategy is evolving to find a less toxic/more effective
dose versus the maximal tolerated dose.8-11 Frequent
ECG monitoring also has become a common requirement
to monitor QT interval and rhythms27; and vital signs,
physical examinations, and non-PK laboratory draws are
required for safety assessment,12-14 which is another primary endpoint of phase 1 trials. We observed that, for all
5 parameters (physical examination, vital sign monitoring, ECGs, non-PK laboratory testing, and PK sampling),
there were significantly greater demands in phase 1 trials
versus phase 2 trials.
These results are supported by earlier findings in the
literature that examined the requirements of phase 2 and 3
studies. For instance, a study by Roche et al26 reviewed the
time requirements of clinical research associates involved in
clinical trial coordination and data collection. Those
authors observed that the work intensity of phase 2 and 3
studies (and a small number of phase 1 studies) was greater
than had been acknowledged previously. Furthermore,
phase and sponsor were identified as significant independent factors that predicted an increased workload after controlling for disease stage. Similar to our results, Roche et al
demonstrated that earlier phase studies and those sponsored
by industry were more time consuming than later phase trials or those that were investigator initiated.
Issues that have been at the forefront in the past several decades regarding phase 1 trials are fading with the
development of newer, more targeted therapies. Concerns
1596

have included the possibility of serious toxicity with minimal benefit from experimental agents. These issues, along
with concerns about patient safety, have resulted in
increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.12-14 In the
largest analysis of phase 1 studies, which included almost
12,000 patients, Horstmann et al15 demonstrated that the
toxic death rate was <0.5%, which is surprisingly low
considering that these patients, by definition, are afflicted
by terminal, untreatable cancer. In addition, although
previous studies demonstrated an overall response rate for
phase 1 studies of only 4.4%, their data revealed an overall
response rate (partial and complete remissions) of 10.6%.
When less than partial responses and stable disease were
included, then the percentage of patients ‘benefiting’ was
44.7%.15,16
Currently, successful clinical trials remain the cornerstone of new drug development. Both phase 1 and
phase 2 clinical trials recently have endured an increase in
the number of requirements and workload. The data from
our study are consistent with those from previous studies
that focused on phase 2 and 3 requirements. However,
our findings indicate that phase 1 studies are even more
complex, as demonstrated here by extensive correlative
testing and safety monitoring, indicating that these studies
require substantial resources and infrastructure.
