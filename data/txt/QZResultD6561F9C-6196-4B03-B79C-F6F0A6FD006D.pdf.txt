Abstract
As key molecules that drive progression and chemoresistance in gastrointestinal cancers, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 have become efficacious drug targets in this setting. Lapatinib is an EGFR/
HER2 kinase inhibitor suppressing signaling through the RAS/RAF/MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)/MAPK (mitogenactivated protein kinase) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathways. Histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACi) are a novel class of agents that induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following the acetylation of histone
and nonhistone proteins modulating gene expression and disrupting HSP90 function inducing the degradation
of EGFR-pathway client proteins. This study sought to evaluate the therapeutic potential of combining lapatinib
with the HDACi panobinostat in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with varying EGFR/HER2 expression and
KRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA mutations. Lapatinib and panobinostat exerted concentration-dependent antiproliferative
effects in vitro (panobinostat range 7.2–30 nmol/L; lapatinib range 7.6–25.8 mmol/L). Combined lapatinib and
panobinostat treatment interacted synergistically to inhibit the proliferation and colony formation in all CRC
cell lines tested. Combination treatment resulted in rapid induction of apoptosis that coincided with increased
DNA double-strand breaks, caspase-8 activation, and PARP cleavage. This was paralleled by decreased signaling
through both the PI3K and MAPK pathways and increased downregulation of transcriptional targets including
NF-kB1, IRAK1, and CCND1. Panobinostat treatment induced downregulation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 mRNA
and protein through transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. In the LoVo KRAS mutant CRC
xenograft model, the combination showed greater antitumor activity than either agent alone, with no apparent
increase in toxicity. Our results offer preclinical rationale warranting further clinical investigation combining
HDACi with EGFR and HER2-targeted therapies for CRC treatment. Cancer Res; 71(10); 3635–48. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the third leading cause of
cancer incidence and second deadliest malignancy in the
United States with an estimated 143,000 new cases and
51,000 deaths in 2010 (1). Despite advances in chemotherapeutic options for CRC, a high incidence of drug resistance and
disease progression remain a major stumbling block to effective disease control. Currently, patients with metastatic disease
have a 5-year survival of less than 10% (2–5). Many patients fail

all standard therapeutic options, while remaining candidates
for continued therapy. There is a critical need for more effective
treatment strategies for patients with metastatic CRC.
Members of the human epidermal receptor (HER) family
including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and to a
lesser extent the HER2 and HER3 play key roles in driving the
oncogenic pathways important for CRC growth and proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (6). Targeting EGFR has shown efficacy in CRC patients with the use of
the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab (7, 8) and panitumumab
(9, 10). However, the therapeutic efficacy of these agents is
currently limited to a subset of CRC patients and the presence of
intrinsic resistance (such as KRAS mutation) or the subsequent
development of resistance represents a serious therapeutic
challenge (11). The identification of alternative approaches
that further disrupt EGFR-dependent tumor cell growth is
critical and may have significant clinical impact. The tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib (Tykerb) targets EGFR and
HER2 and is approved for metastatic breast cancer and is
under clinical investigation in a variety of tumor types including
CRC (12, 13).
A novel class of anticancer agents that may improve the
efficacy of HER-targeted agents are histone deacetylase

inhibitors (HDACi). HDACi elicit their anticancer activity
through the hyperacetylation of both histone and nonhistone proteins resulting in alterations in chromatin structure,
transcriptional activity, gene expression changes, growth
arrest, and apoptosis (14–16). HDACi can also induce the
acetylation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is a
critical molecular chaperone involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis (17). Disruption of the HSP90 chaperone
complex through acetylation results in the destabilization of
client proteins critical for cancer cell survival and continued
proliferation including members of the HER family (18, 19).
Importantly, variation in HSP90 dependency has been
reported in specific tumor subtypes that harbor HER-signaling aberrations including EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations in
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and HER2 amplification
in breast cancer (19, 20). In addition to protein destabilization, HDACi are reported to induce potent transcriptional
effects in multiple pathways that disrupt tumor progression
including HER signaling, dNTP biosynthesis, angiogenesis,
invasion, and mitosis (21–23). These transcriptional effects
are reported to occur through inhibition of new transcript
synthesis and destabilization and accelerated decay of
mature transcripts (22, 23).
Panobinostat (LBH589) functions as an HDACi-targeting
class I and II HDACs and has shown activity in hematologic
and nonhematologic tumor models and is under extensive
clinical evaluation (24, 25). HDACi have shown synergistic
antitumor efficacy with a variety of structurally diverse anticancer agents. Previously we reported that HDACi synergized
with fluoropyrimidines in CRC cancer cells through downregulation of the fluoropyrimidine target enzyme thymidylate
synthase (22) and we tested these observations in the clinical
setting (26). Additional synergistic interactions with HDACi
have been reported including combinations with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (27), and TRAIL (tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand) agonist antibodies
(28) and the EGFR TKI gefitinib in head and neck cancer (29).
The molecular basis for these synergistic interactions is
attributed to HDACi-induced changes in expression or activity
of a specific drug target. Importantly, a recent study showed
that panobinostat induced downregulation of EGFR in mutant
EGFR lung cancer cells and that combined treatment with the
EGFR TKI erlotinib resulted in synergistic antiproliferative
effects (19). An additional study also reported that the HDACi
LAQ824 induced downregulation of HER2 in HER2-amplified
breast cancer cells resulting in a synergistic interaction with
trastuzumab (30).
As EGFR and HER2 are of key importance in promoting
tumor cell proliferation and survival in CRC, we tested the
hypothesis that combined targeting of EGFR and HER2 by
lapatinib in combination with panobinostat would have synergistic antiproliferative effects in CRC models with different
mutational statuses.

Compounds and reagents
Panobinostat (LBH589) was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Vorinostat was provided by the National Cancer
Institute. Entinostat (MS-275) and lapatinib were purchased
from LC Laboratories. CellTiter 96 Aqueous MTS was purchased from Promega. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
(hydroxypropy)methylcellulose (HPMC) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. 17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17-AAG) was purchased from A.G. Scientific, Inc. Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail was purchased from
Thermo Scientific.
Cell lines
The human CRC cell lines DLD-1, HCT116, HT29, LoVo, and
RKO were purchased from American Type Culture Collection.
DLD-1, LoVo, and RKO were maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM). HCT116 and HT29 were maintained in McCoy's 5A. H630 CRC cells were a gift from Edward
Chu at the Yale Cancer Center and maintained in DMEM.
Media was supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza) with penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a humidified Forma
incubator (Forma) at 37 C with 5% CO2 and routinely
screened for mycoplasma using the MycoALERT detection
kit (Lonza).
Growth inhibition assay and drug combination analysis
The CellTiter 96 AQueous MTS assay (Promega) was carried
out according to the manufacturers guidelines and as previously described (22). IC50(72 hours) values were calculated
from sigmoidal dose–response curves utilizing Prism (Graphpad). The combination effect was determined by the combination index (CI) method (31) utilizing Calcusyn software
(Biosoft). Fraction affected (FA) was calculated from the
percent growth inhibition: FA ¼ (100 – % growth inhibition)/100. CI values less than 1, synergism; 1–1.2, additive;
and more than 1.2, antagonism.
Colony formation assay
The colony formation assay was carried out as previously
described (32). Three concentrations of panobinostat were
selected to induce dose-dependent decreases in colony
forming capacity. Because lapatinib is considered a targeted
agent, a fixed clinically meaningful dose of 3 mmol/L was
used to evaluate the combined drug effect. Following a
transient 24 hours drug exposure, culture media was
replaced with drug-free medium and cells were allowed to
grow for 7 to 14 days. Colonies were then fixed, stained,
counted, and drug-treated samples compared directly to
untreated controls set at 100%.
Flow cytometric/sub-G1 analysis
Cell cycle and viability were determined by flow cytometric
analysis of DNA content after a 24-hour drug exposure as
previously described (33). Cells were harvested and analyzed
using a Coulter EPICS ELITE flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Cell populations were quantified using Expo32 software
(Beckman Coulter). Cells with DNA content less than 1 were

2-tailed ANOVA was carried out using Prism (Graphpad).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was preformed as previously described
(33). Cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor. Protein concentrations
were quantified according to the BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce).
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated using TRizol according to manufacturer's
instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was reverse transcribed using
500 ng RNA using qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions and analyzed using PerfeCTa
SYBR Green Supermix (Quanta Biosciences Inc.) and an
Applied Biosystems 7500 PCR Detection System (Applied
Biosystems Inc.). Target genes (Supplementary Table S1) were
normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase) and quantified using the comparative Ct method (34).
Histograms and statistical analysis (2-tailed paired Student's t
test) were carried out using Prism (Graphpad).
In vivo analysis
Xenograft experiments were conducted in male C57Bl/6
BALB/c mice (Taconic Labs) that were 6- to 8-week old.
Subcutaneous LoVo CRC xenografts were established and
allowed to grow until they reached 100 mm3 (day 0). Animals
were randomized to treatment groups: vehicle, panobinostat,
lapatinib, and combination of panobinostat and lapatinib (n ¼
6, group). Panobinostat was administered at 2.5 mg/kg by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection q.d. for 5 consecutive days a
week. Lapatinib was administered by oral gavage at 30 mg/kg
BID for the duration of the study. Two perpendicular diameters of tumors were measured every 2 days with a digital
caliper by the same investigator. Tumor volume (TV) was

calculated according to the following formula: TV (mm3) ¼
[length (mm)  width (mm)2]/2. Animal body weight was
measured every 2 days as an index of toxicity.

Results
IC50(72 hours) growth inhibitory effects of
panobinostat and lapatinib in CRC cell lines
Prior to evaluating lapatinib in combination with panobinostat, we first analyzed the antiproliferative activity of both
agents separately in a panel of 6 heterogenous CRC cell lines
(Table 1). DLD-1, H630, HCT116, HT29, LoVo, and RKO CRC
cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of lapatinib
and panobinostat for 72 hours and growth inhibition was
measured by MTS assay. In all CRC cell lines tested, panobinostat showed concentration-dependent growth inhibitory
activity with IC50(72 hours) values ranging between 4.2 and
26 nmol/L (Table 1). Lapatinib exerted concentration-dependent growth inhibitory activity with IC50(72 hours) values
ranging from 5.5 to 25.9 mmol/L (Table 1). Consistent with
our previous observations (33), the IC50(72 hours) values
obtained for lapatinib in this short-term growth inhibition
assay are representative of cells which are relatively resistant
to the growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib.
Panobinostat combined with lapatinib synergistically
inhibits CRC cell proliferation and colony formation
We previously determined the EGFR and HER2 protein
expression in a panel of CRC cell lines and showed that 4
of 5 cell lines analyzed (DLD-1, H630, HCT116, HT-29, and
LoVo) had significant EGFR expression with the exception of
the H630 cell line which had low EGFR expression but
expressed HER2 at a significant level compared to the other
CRC cell lines (Table 1; ref. 33).
CRC cell lines were subsequently treated with increasing
concentrations of panobinostat and lapatinib alone and
in combination for 72 hours and growth inhibition was

measured by MTS assay. The median-effect analysis method
(31) was utilized to evaluate the combined drug effect.
Simultaneous treatment with panobinostat and lapatinib
resulted in synergistic increases in growth inhibition at 0.5
FA and synergistic CI values of less than 1 over the majority
of concentrations tested in all CRC cell lines examined
(Fig. 1). Of note, this interaction was observed in cell lines

while concomitant treatment with both agents yielded the
highest FA, preincubating cells with either agent followed
by the inverse also yielded additive to synergistic effects

addition, 2 additional HDACi were also evaluated in combination with lapatinib in the H630 and LoVo cell lines. In

Panobinostat and Lapatinib in Colorectal Cancer Cells

the H630 cell line, lapatinib in combination with entinostat
showed synergistic interactions across the range of concentrations evaluated. In contrast, the combination with vorinostat
yielded primarily additive effects and only at elevated concentrations. In LoVo cells, lapatinib combined with entinostat
yielded increases in the FA and additive to synergistic interactions across most concentrations tested. Lapatinib combined with vorinostat in the LoVo cells did not show any
significant increase in the FA (Supplementary Fig. S2).
A long-term clonogenicity assay was subsequently carried
out to assess the capacity of panobinostat and lapatinib
combinations to cause irreversible growth arrest in 4 CRC
cell lines. Combined drug analysis was carried out using 3
increasing concentrations of panobinostat that induced dosedependent decreases in colony forming capacity. The concentrations selected were well within clinically relevant doses
(24). The selected panobinostat concentrations were also
combined with 3 mmol/L lapatinib, a fixed clinically relevant
dose for 24 hours followed by drug removal and outgrowth in
drug-free medium (12). In all cell lines evaluated, increasing
doses of panobinostat alone resulted in a dose-dependent
suppression of colony formation (Fig. 2A). Combining 3
mmol/L lapatinib with the increasing concentrations of panobinostat resulted in significant suppression of colony formation in all 4 cell lines examined (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S3).
Lapatinib enhances panobinostat-induced apoptosis in
CRC cells
DLD-1, H630, HCT116, and LoVo CRC cells were treated
with 3 mmol/L lapatinib, 10 and 15 nmol/L panobinostat and
combinations for 24 hours and DNA content was analyzed
by flow cytometry to measure the onset of apoptosis. Treatment with lapatinib did not induce any significant alterations
in the percentage of cells in sub-G1 (indicative of apoptosis)
compared to control in any of the CRC cell lines (Fig. 2B).
Treatment with 10 and 15 nmol/L panobinostat resulted in a
dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G1
in 3 of the 4 CRC cell lines. Interestingly the DLD-1 cells
showed resistance to panobinostat-induced apoptosis with
less than 5% of cells in sub-G1. However, the combinations
of 3 mmol/L lapatinib with both 10 and 15 nmol/L panobinostat in the DLD-1 cells increased the number of apoptotic
cells in sub-G1 to 24.1% and 30.1%. Significant increases in
apoptosis were also observed in the H630, HCT116, and LoVo
cells with the addition of 3 mmol/L lapatinib to 15 nmol/L
panobinostat increasing the number of cells in sub-G1 from
28.6%, 24.9%, and 27.5% with panobinostat alone to 52.1%,
43.4%, and 50.9%, respectively (Fig. 2B).
The induction of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis
was assessed by Western blotting for gH2A.X (Ser139) and
activation of caspase-8 and PARP cleavage. H630 and LoVo
CRC cells were treated as above for 18 and 24 hours. Lapatinib
treatment resulted in no detectable increase in gH2A.X when
compared to controls whereas panobinostat treatment alone
increased gH2A.X as early as 18 hours in both H630 and LoVo
cells. Lapatinib plus panobinostat induced gH2A.X to a greater
extent in both cell lines when compared to either single agent.

www.aacrjournals.org

Lapatinib treatment alone in H630 and LoVo cells did not
induce cleavage of caspase-8 or PARP (Fig. 2C). As expected, 15
nmol/L panobinostat induced low levels of PARP cleavage
consistent with the low level of apoptosis occurring. However,
combination treatment increased both caspase-8 and PARP
cleavage at 18 and 24 hours in both cell lines.
Panobinostat in combination with lapatinib
synergistically inhibits the growth of LoVo xenografts in
nude mice
LoVo CRC xenografts were established as outlined in the
Materials and Methods. Panobinostat was administered at
2.5 mg/kg by i.p. injection q.d. for 5 days each week and
lapatinib was administered at 30 mg/kg BID by oral gavage for
the duration of the study. Single-agent lapatinib and panobinostat resulted in modest tumor growth inhibition when
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3A). However,
coadministration of lapatinib and panobinostat resulted in
the greatest tumor growth inhibition compared to vehicle
controls. At the end of the 24-day treatment period, lapatinib
monotherapy resulted in a 4.1% reduction in mean TV to
1,075.3  163.3 mm3 compared to the vehicle control group
with a mean TV of 1,121.7  288.9 mm3 (Fig. 3A). Panobinostat monotherapy resulted in a reduction in mean TV of 23.8%
to 954.6  275.9 mm3 when compared to the vehicle-treated
group. However, panobinostat plus lapatinib resulted in a
reduction in mean TV of 49.8% to 563.2  111.6 mm3 when
compared to the vehicle-treated group (P < 0.05). Lapatinib
plus panobinostat also resulted in a highly significant increase
in tumor delay (Td) with a ratio of observed:expected of 1.15,
indicative of a synergistic increase in antitumor activity
(Fig. 3B). Importantly, combination treatment did not cause
any significant difference in body weight compared to monotherapy (P ¼ 0.48; Fig. 3C).
HDAC inhibition modulates ERBB family gene and
protein expression
We subsequently investigated the effects of panobinostat
on both HER-family gene and protein expression in CRC
models. DLD-1, H630, HCT116, and LoVo cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of panobinostat for 24 hours
and the mRNA expression of ERBB1 (EGFR) and ERBB2
(HER2) was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR). Although the DLD-1 and LoVo cells showed an initial
induction of ERBB1 mRNA at the lower doses of panobinostat
(10–25 nmol/L), treatment with 100 nmol/L panobinostat
resulted in a significant reduction of ERBB1 mRNA in all cell
lines examined (Fig. 4A). ERBB2 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in DLD-1, H630, and LoVo cells with
100 nmol/L panobinostat (Fig. 4B).
The effect of increasing concentrations of panobinostat on
EGFR and HER2 protein expression in DLD-1, H630, HCT116,
and LoVo cells was evaluated. Panobinostat treatment for 24
hours resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in both EGFR
and HER2 protein in all cell lines examined (Fig. 4C). Importantly, at the concentration of 15 nmol/L panobinostat used
for the apoptotic analyses, all cell lines showed downregulation of EGFR and HER2 protein. DLD-1 and LoVo cells, which

downregulated approximately 2-fold following treatment with
15 nmol/L panobinostat in the H630 cells. In the LoVo cells,
ERBB1 mRNA was increased 2-fold and ERBB2 mRNA was

greater extent than panobinostat treatment alone as a result
of combination treatment. Interestingly, the induction of
ERBB1 mRNA observed with panobinostat treatment in the
LoVo cells was completely abrogated with combination treatment (Fig. 5A).
To confirm the decrease in EGFR/HER2 signaling, we
subsequently analyzed the mRNA expression of 3 known
downstream transcriptional targets of EGFR signaling
(35–37). Lapatinib treatment alone had no significant effects
on CCND1 and IRAK1 gene expression in both the LoVo and
H630 cell. However, in the LoVo cells, lapatinib treatment

alone induced a 3-fold downregulation of NF-kB1 mRNA
expression. Panobinostat alone induced significant downregulation of CCND1, NF-kB1, and IRAK1 (Fig. 5A). As expected,
combination treatment enhanced the downregulation of
CCND1, NF-kB1, and IRAK1 gene expression greater than
panobinostat alone, consistent with the enhanced disruption
of HER signaling (Fig. 5A).

throughout this study. All cell lines had detectable expression
of ERBB3 mRNA (Fig. 6A, left). HER3 protein expression was
also detectable in all cell lines, with a 15-fold range of
expression from the highest; HT29 to the lowest; RKO
(Fig. 6A, right).
We subsequently investigated the effects of panobinostat
on HER3 mRNA and protein expression in H630 and
LoVo CRC cells. Both cell lines showed a dose-dependent
decrease in ERBB3 mRNA expression with panobinostat
treatment (Fig. 6B, left). In addition both cell lines showed
a significant downregulation of HER3 protein following

24 hours over control levels that is abrogated by combination
treatment (Fig. 5C).
Panobinostat downregulates HER3, a known resistance
marker to EGFR/HER2-targeted therapy
It has been shown that the increased expression and
activation of HER3, the preferred dimerization partner for
HER2, represents a mechanism of resistance to lapatinib
treatment (38, 39). However, HER3 expression in CRC remains
to be firmly established (40). Basal HER3 mRNA and protein
expression was determined for the 6 cell lines utilized

whereas EGFR and HER2 could be potently downregulated
by the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG, HER3 protein expression
remained unchanged suggesting that the mechanism of
downregulation of HER3 is transcriptional (Supplementary

or protein expression at 24 hours in either cell line. However,
combination treatment resulted in a significantly greater
decrease in ERBB3 mRNA and protein compared to panobinostat alone (Fig. 6C, left). These data indicate that panobinostat may be effective at disrupting the potential role of HER3
as a mechanism of resistance to HER-targeted therapy.

Discussion
EGFR is overexpressed in 60% to 80% of CRC and is reported
to play an important role in promoting the growth and
progression of CRC. On the basis of EGFR's key role in
promoting the survival and progression of CRC and the
emerging evidence that HDACi downregulate receptor TK
expression, the effect of targeting EGFR/HER2 in combination
with HDAC inhibition in CRC cells was evaluated.
Combining lapatinib with panobinostat resulted in synergistic decreases in CRC cell proliferation, colony formation and
rapidly induced apoptosis. Mechanistic evaluation of this combination showed that there was a significant enhancement of
DNA damage (analyzed by gH2A.X), increased activation of
caspase-8 and PARP cleavage, decreased ERBB1 (EGFR) and
ERBB2 (HER2) mRNA and protein expression and decreased
phosphorylation of AKT –(Ser139) and MAPK-Thr202/Thy204.
When tested in vivo, lapatinib plus panobinostat at therapeutically relevant doses showed significantly delayed tumor
growth and a reduction in TV in the LoVo CRC xenograft.
One of the most interesting observations is that CRC cell
lines with a wide range of expression of EGFR and/or HER2
showed a highly significant sensitization to panobinostat as a
result of lapatinib treatment. These data would strongly
suggest that inhibition of HER-mediated signaling overcomes
a key survival or resistance mechanism to HDACi treatment.
On the basis of the modest growth inhibition and lack of
apoptosis observed with lapatinib treatment alone at lower
doses (3 mmol/L), it seems plausible that cell survival and
proliferation following HDACi treatment may be dependent
on signaling from EGFR and/or HER2. We also confirmed a
potential role for PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and MAPK
signaling in mediating response to panobinostat treatment by
combinations using specific inhibitors of MEK (MAP/ERK
kinase) and PI3K and observing synergistic growth inhibitory
effects (Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, several cell lines
utilized in this study possess activating mutations in RAS, RAF,
and/or PIK3CA and yet synergistic drug interactions to varying
extents were observed in all cell lines. Interestingly, a recent
report showed that lapatinib was effective at suppressing

www.aacrjournals.org

signaling via PI3K/AKT even in the presence of activating
PI3K mutations providing an explanation for our observations
in PI3K mutant CRC cells (38). It would appear that concomitant treatment with lapatinib may reduce the cells ability to
tolerate and survive the cytotoxic effects of panobinostat. This
hypothesis is indeed supported by observations in CRC where
EGFR-targeted therapies have had their greatest impact and
showed the most promising efficacy in combination with
other structurally and functionally diverse cytotoxic agents.
A number of clinical studies reported that cetuximab resensitized irinotecan-refractory mCRC patients to irinotecan,
implicating EGFR as the mode of resistance in a subset of
these patients (7, 41). In addition, cetuximab and panitumumab have both improved clinical outcome in combination
with oxaliplatin and irinotecan-containing regimens in KRAS
wild-type patients in randomized trials (42, 43). The clinical
data therefore support the role of EGFR in mediating cytotoxicity induced by chemotherapeutic agents.
The complex interplay between EGFR and the other members of ErbB receptor family members directly influences the
susceptibility of tumor cells to EGFR-targeted agents. We
therefore evaluated the influence of HDACi treatment alone
and in combination with lapatinib on the mRNA and protein
expression of HER2 and HER3. We observed very clear cell-line
specific effects on mRNA expression in response to panobinostat treatment. Downregulation of EGFR and HER2 mRNA
was not a consistent observation throughout all the cell
lines and induction of EGFR mRNA was noted in some cell
lines. However, in all cell lines analyzed, downregulation of
EGFR and HER2 protein expression was observed at concentrations where no downregulation (and even induction) of
mature mRNA transcript was observed. These data strongly
imply the disruption of EGFR and HER2 protein stability
induced by HDACi. In addition, It is likely that the induction of
mRNA observed in some cell lines represents the activation of a
regulatory or feedback mechanism in an attempt to reestablish
protein expression following HDACi treatment.
The expression levels and functional roles of HER2 and HER3
in CRC are not well established or described. Our previous
studies and others have reported that a subset of CRC cells do
express HER2 (33, 44, 45). This is of particular importance as
HER2 is reportedly the preferred dimerization partner for other
members of the HER family including EGFR and can intensify
receptor-initiated signaling events (46). A recent study evaluated pertuzumab, an antibody that inhibits HER2 dimerization, in CRC cell line and xenograft models. The authors
reported that pertuzumab showed growth inhibitory activity
as a single agent and enhanced activity when combined with
the EGFR TKI erlotinib providing evidence supporting the
inhibition of both EGFR and HER2 simultaneously in CRC
(47). We also report that HER3 is expressed to varying extents
in our CRC models and that panobinostat is effective at
downregulating its expression at both the mRNA and protein
level. This is of particular importance given the reported role of
HER3 in mediating resistance to HER TKI therapy (48).
The mechanistic basis for the observed synergy between
lapatinib and panobinostat combination appears to be
multifactorial. We provide the first report indicating that

panobinostat can downregulate both EGFR and HER2 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in a panel of
CRC cell lines. We also show that HSP90 inhibition in
combination with lapatinib treatment shows a synergistic
interaction in our CRC models (Supplementary Fig. S5A)
clearly suggesting a role for EGFR/HER2 signaling in mediating the recovery from the unfolded protein response.
Interestingly, studies evaluating HDACi treatment in additional tumor types have reported significant differences in
the regulation of HER-family members and the cytotoxicity
that results. HDACi treatment appears to preferentially
downregulate mutant EGFR in NSCLC when compared to
the wild-type protein as a result of increased dependence on
HSP90 (19, 20). In addition, HER2-amplified breast cancer
cells appear to show increased sensitivity to HDACi treatment as a result of rapid depletion of HER2 following
entinostat treatment. Tumors with specific HER-family
molecular alterations, such as tyrosine kinase mutation
and gene amplification, have significantly differently clinicopathologic characteristics associated with these alterations and are treated with distinctly different therapeutic
strategies in the clinic. However, with CRC, it is well established that EGFR mutation is an extremely rare event and
only a small subset possess EGFR amplification (49).
Response to EGFR-targeted therapy and EGFR expression
do not correlate well in CRC (even in the context of KRAS
mutation) and confirmed reports of significant disease
response has been observed in CRC patients whose tumors
express little to no EGFR as detected by immunohistochemistry. The results of the current study would indicate that
EGFR and HER2 are substrates for HSP90 in the context of
CRC.
In our CRC models, HSP90 inhibition potently downregulated EGFR and HER2 but did not downregulate HER3 protein
and in fact induced ERBB2 and ERBB3 mRNA suggesting the
presence of regulatory mechanisms possibly as a result of
HER2 and EGFR protein loss (Supplementary Fig S5B and
C). Induction of ErbB3 mRNA in response to HDACi treatment
has been reported in NSCLC although the expression of
HER3 protein in this specific study was not evaluated (50)
However, panobinostat induced dose-dependent downregulation of HER3 at the mRNA and protein level. In the
current study, we noted that panobinostat can downregulate
ERBB1 and ERBB2 gene expression at clinically achievable
concentrations in the majority of the CRC cell lines we tested

indicating that panobinostat also elicits transcriptional effects,
either through disruption of the gene transcriptional machinery, or possibly via an mRNA destabilization mechanism, in
addition to the disruption of HSP90 function. The potential
importance of the transcriptional component was further
suggested by the combination of lapatinib with the HDACi
entinostat. Entinostat is a Class I specific HDACi and does not
target HDAC6 which is reported to regulate HSP90 function.
The combination of lapatinib with entinostat showed additive
and synergistic effects in both the H630 and LoVo cell lines.
However, entinostat is a structurally different HDACi belonging to the benzamide class and it is not yet clear whether
entinostat can influence protein stability via non-HSP90
mechanisms. Currently, further analysis is underway to evaluate both the contributory mechanisms to this transcriptional
effect and additional potential contributing mechanisms to the
drug interaction that may include reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and the potential role of EGFR and HER2 signaling
in regulating the cellular response to ROS. The model that
these data propose is one where lapatinib inhibits ligandinitiated signaling from EGFR and HER2, whereas panobinostat simultaneously induces disruption of EGFR, HER2, and
HER3 translational disruption (Supplementary Fig. S6). The
combined loss of receptor-initiated signaling and the downregulation of EGFR and HER2 expression and inhibition of
replenishment through transcriptional and posttranslational
mechanisms result in rapid cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
These observations strongly support further clinical evaluation of HER-targeted therapies in combination with HDACi
in the treatment of CRC.
