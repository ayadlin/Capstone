ABSTRACT
Trastuzumab is an antibody-based therapy drug targeting HER2-overexpressing
tumors. While it has been proven to be very successful initially, most patients
eventually develop resistance to trastuzumab. The mechanism of drug resistance
is not well understood. Identifying pathways that mediate trastuzumab resistance
will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism and is crucial for the
development of therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.
Here we report a quantitative proteomics profiling of a trastuzumab-sensitive (TS) gastric cancer cell line NCI N87 and a trastuzumab-resistant NCI N87 (T-R) subline
generated by low-dose, continuous trastuzumab treatment. By identifying proteins
differentially expressed in these two cell lines, we show that multiple pathways including
mTOR, Wnt, DNA damage response and metabolic pathways are significantly altered.
We further confirm by western blotting that protein levels of multiple components of the
mTOR pathway, including mTOR, AKT and RPS6KB1, are increased, whereas AKT1S1 is
decreased, suggesting the activation of mTOR pathway. Importantly, treatment of AZD8055,
an mTOR inhibitor, leads to the decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR downstream
molecules RPS6KB1 at Thr421/Ser424 and AKT at Ser473. Furthermore, AZD8055 also
preferentially reduces viability, and inhibits migration and invasion abilities of the T-R cells.
Together, our findings indicate that mTOR pathway is among multiple signaling pathways
that mediate trastuzumab resistance in NCI N87 T-R cells, and that mTOR inhibitors may
be used to treat trastuzumab resistant, HER2-positive gastric cancer tumors.

epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2),
which is encoded by the ERBB2 gene [2, 3]. It is a member
of the HER family proteins and its overexpression has a
positive correlation with tumor cell proliferation, adhesion,
migration and invasion [4]. Approximately 15~20% of GC
cases have ERBB2 DNA amplification along with consistent

INTRODUCTION
Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most
common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer
related death [1]. GC is often detected at late stages with few
treatment options. One actionable GC biomarker is human

overexpression of HER2 protein [5, 6]. The aberrant
overexpression or activation of HER2 is thought to trigger
multiple cellular signaling pathways which drive abnormal
cell proliferation, drug resistance and metastasis [4, 7].
Molecular targeting therapy has been deemed a
highly effective strategy for cancer treatment. Trastuzumab
(Herceptin®), a humanized monoclonal antibody against
the extracellular domain of HER2, has been widely used in
HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) and GC in combination
with chemotherapy in clinical treatment [8–11]. However,
due to the acquired resistance to trastuzumab, the effect
is limited. It was shown that only less than 13% of the
patients benefitted from the trastuzumab therapy [12, 13].
Several pathways for trastuzumab resistance in
GC have been identified. Some genetic mutations may
contribute to GC survival independent of the therapeutic
targets. For example, the p110a subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA)
and c.428T>C (p.V143A) homozygous mutation in exon5 of
TP53 gene lead to drug resistance and therefore potentially
affect the efficacy of clinical therapy [14, 15]. Activation of
HER2 target mutation, up-regulation of the PI3K signaling
pathway, accumulation of truncated HER2 receptor,
activation of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) and
loss of the PTEN, are among the major pathways identified in
BC [16–21]. Additionally, activation of crosstalk of HER2 to
other molecules such as HER3 and MET leads to subsequent
activation of downstream signaling pathways [10, 22, 23].
Activation of alternative pathways, such as amplification
or mutation of c-MET and SRC activation, low immune
response [17, 24], and overexpression of Cyclin E have
also been shown in BC [25]. While some of these pathway
alterations are shared by GC, there are also GC-specific
mechanisms. Activation of the IL-6/STAT3/Jagged-1/Notch
pathways [26], overexpression of FGFR3 and its ligand
FGF9 [27], catecholamine-induced β2-adrenergic receptor
activation which mediates desensitization by upregulating
MUC4 expression [28], activation of STAT3 via upregulation
of MUC1 and MUC4 expression [29], are some examples.
Comparing to BC, molecular pathways that mediate acquired
trastuzumab-resistance in GC is less understood [30–32].
While DNA sequencing has been a method of choice
in the past to identify activated oncogenic pathways
in tumors at genomic level, global proteome profiling
by mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful
tool to characterize proteomics changes [15, 33]. Our
lab has developed a fast sequencing (Fast-seq) and a
label-free quantification (LFQ) workflow (Fast-quan),
by which more than 8,000 proteins can be identified and
quantified within 12 hours of MS running time [34, 35].
This workflow allows us to analyze a variety of biological
samples with consistent results.
In this study, we performed proteomic profiling of a
pair of gastric cancer cell lines consisting of a trastuzumabsensitive NCI N87 and a trastuzumab-resistant subline
derived from NCI N87. We identified differentially expressed
proteins and investigated the corresponding signaling

pathways by bioinformatics analysis. Additional biochemical
and functional validation suggest that the mTOR pathway is
activated in T-R cells, implicating the mTOR pathway as a
potential molecular target for treating tumors arising from
trastuzumab resistance.

RESULTS
Proteomic profiling of NCI N87 T-S and T-R cells
We obtained a pair of T-S and T-R cells as described
in [26] from the Shi lab. The T-R cells exhibited marked
resistance to trastuzumab compared with the T-S cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). Western blotting showed that
the HER2 levels in the 2 cell lines were comparable, which
was in accordance with the MS data (Supplementary
Figure 2A, 2B and 2C). Additionally, T-R cells grew faster
than T-S cells (Supplementary Figure 3A), and displayed
typical morphology of epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) (Supplementary Figure 3B), implying
their higher invasive and metastatic potentials. All these
characteristics are consistent with the previous report [26].
To identify signal transduction pathways that mediate
trastuzumab resistance, we performed quantitative proteomic
profiling of the T-S and T-R cells. As shown in Figure 1,
we performed 4 biological replicates on both cell lines and
quantified protein abundance with label-free, intensity-based
absolute quantification (iBAQ). We normalized protein loading
by taking the fraction of total (FOT) followed by multiplication
of 105 to obtain iFOT5. A total of 8201 proteins that were
detected with at least 2 unique and high quality peptides (1%
false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide level and Mascot
ion score greater than 20) were identified. Among them,
6838 proteins were identified at 1% protein FDR (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Table 1), and 5596 were found reproducibly
in at least 4 of the 8 experiments (Figure 2A, Supplementary
Table 2). These 5596 proteins were used for subsequent
statistical and bioinformatics analyses. The high correlation
(r >0.8) of each pair of the 4 replicates demonstrated a good
reproducibility of our measurements (Figure 2B). A principal
component analysis (PCA) showed that the T-S and T-R data
sets were well separated, and four biological replicates of each
cell line were well-clustered (Figure 2C). The distribution of
fold changes was shown in a histogram (Figure 2D).

Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
proteins and pathways
We performed student’s t tests to identify differentially
expressed proteins that were statistically significant. As
illustrated in the volcano plot (Figure 3A, Supplementary
Table 3), the abundance of 118 proteins (2.1% of the
proteome) showed more than twofold increase in T-R
cells (p value <0.05, marked as red dots), whereas 84
proteins (1.5% of the proteome) showed more than
twofold decrease in T-R cells (p value <0.05, marked as

blue dots). The remaining 5394 proteins (96.4% of the
proteome) were considered as not significantly changed.
Seven differentially expressed proteins that were identified
with 1-3 spectrum counts (PSMs) were manually
validated (Supplementary Figure 4). The differentially
expressed proteins were analyzed by gene ontology
(GO) terms enrichment analysis using the WEB-based
Gene Set Analysis Toolkit (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/
webgestalt/option.php) [36]. The enrichment of increased
or decreased proteins in cellular component, biological
process and molecular function are shown in Figure 3B
and 3C, respectively. Proteins that are increased in T-R
cells are annotated as localized in extracellular region,
macromolecular complex, and membrane-bounded
organelle, whereas those decreased in T-R cells are
annotated as residing in extracellular region, intracellular
part and cell periphery. As for biological processes,
increased proteins include those involved in regulation
of Rho-Rac GTPase activity, Rho-Rac protein signal
transduction and metabolic process, and decreased proteins
were primarily shown as cellular response to stimuli,
epithelial development and regulation of transport. As to
molecular functions, the increased proteins are enriched in
transferase activity, ion binding and phosphatase activity,
whereas the decreased proteins function in protein binding,
catalytic activity and cargo receptor activity. We employed
the STRING database (http://string.embl.de/) [37] to build
a network of the differentially expressed proteins using

high confidence (scores >0.7) expressions and visualize
the resulting network using Cytoscape (v3.4.0). We found
that AKT, mTOR and CDK4 represent three main hubs
formed by up-regulated proteins, and AKT1S1, CASP8
and SDC1 represent three primary hubs formed by downregulated proteins (Figure 3D). Enrichment analysis
showed that several key cancer signaling pathways are
activated in T-R cells, with main interaction nodes formed
by components of mTOR, Wnt, p53, metabolic and B cell
receptor signaling pathways (Figure 3E). A quantitative
representation of these proteins is illustrated in the heat
map (Figure 3F).

Quantitative proteome profiling uncovers
the activation of mTOR signaling pathway in
trastuzumab-resistant cells
Among the activated pathways in T-R cells, the
over-representation of mTOR pathway components
caught our attention. MS identified 30 proteins associated
with mTOR pathway (Supplementary Table 4_D1),
and several key signaling molecules, such as mTOR,
AKT, RPS6KB1, RPS6KA1, MLST8 and AKT1S1,
showed significant changes in abundance (Figure 4A,
Supplementary Table 4_D2). These signaling molecules
were represented by a network diagram of mTOR pathway
(Figure 4B). Next, we confirmed the altered expression
of mTOR, AKT, AKT1S1 and RPS6KB1 by western

molecular effect than rapamycin [38–40]. It is currently
being assessed, alone or in combination, in phase I
clinical trials in oncology [41, 42]. To test the inhibitory
effect of AZD8055 on mTOR pathway in GC cells, we
treated T-S and T-R cells with increasing concentrations
of AZD8055 for 48 h and measured cell viability.
AZD8055 suppressed both T-S and T-R cells in a dosedependent manner, but the effect was more pronounced
in T-R cells at all dosages. While the moderate difference
was insignificant at 25 and 50 nM (p>0.05), it was
statistically significant at 100 nM with the cell viability

of 67.7% and 52.3% for T-S and T-R, respectively
(p<0.05) (Figure 6A). A similar trend was observed when
cells were treated with higher dosages (p<0.01) (Figure
6A). These results showed that T-R cells appeared to be
more susceptible to mTOR inhibition by AZD8055 than
T-S cells at concentrations above 100 nM, consistent with
its stronger dependence on mTOR pathway for survival.
To confirm the pathways that mediate trastuzumab
resistance, we performed western blotting to examine the
phosphorylation levels of RPS6KB1 at Thr421/Ser424
and AKT at Ser473, which are known signaling events

in the mTOR pathway. As anticipated, p-RPS6KB1(Thr421/
Ser424)
and p-AKT(Ser473) were higher in T-R cells than in
T-S cells, and the decrease of p-RPS6KB1(Thr421/Ser424) in
T-R cells after AZD8055 treatment was more pronounced
between 50 and 200 nM, but was not significantly
different at 800 nM (Figure 6B). A similar trend was

also observed in p-AKT(Ser473) (Figure 6B). Moreover,
immunofluorescence of p-RPS6KB1(Thr421/Ser424) also
showed similar results as the western blot (Figure 6C).
Taken together, our results strongly suggest that mTOR
pathway is activated in T-R cells, which could be
preferentially inhibited by AZD8055.

DISCUSSION

AZD8055 inhibits the migration and invasion of
trastuzumab-resistant cells

HER2 gene amplification and protein overexpression is a driver for malignant transformation, and
is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance
[43, 44]. Although trastuzumab represents one of the
most successful anti-HER2 antibodies in GC therapy,
its therapeutic efficacy is proven to be limited due to
acquired drug resistance. While mRNA sequencing has
been widely used in identifying transcriptional alterations,
increasing evidence suggests that the correlation between
protein and mRNA is poor. Clearly if one searches
for actionable drug targets, measuring protein is more
effective than measuring mRNA. Recent advancement
in mass spectrometry instrumentation and method has
made proteome profiling a feasible approach. Here, we
employed quantitative proteomic profiling strategy to
identify pathways that mediate trastuzumab resistance.

Cancer cells often display high migration and
invasion abilities after acquiring drug resistance. Here
we evaluated how AZD8055 inhibits migration and
invasion of T-S and T-R cells by transwell assays. In the
absence of AZD8055, more T-R cells passed through
the polycarbonate membrane than T-S cells (p<0.05);
however, in the presence of AZD8055, migration of T-R
cells was inhibited (p<0.05), whereas migration of T-S
cells was not noticeably inhibited (p>0.05) (Figure 7A).
Similarly, the higher invasion ability of T-R cells was
also significantly inhibited by AZD8055 (p<0.05) (Figure
7B). Our results suggest that activation of mTOR pathway
promotes migration and invasion in vitro in T-R cells, and
AZD8055 can preferentially block the mTOR pathway in
T-R cells.

Our data indicate that multiple mTOR pathway components
are expressed at elevated levels in T-R cells, suggesting
that mTOR activation plays a crucial role in supporting
T-R cell proliferation when HER2 is inhibited.
mTOR is the key component in this pathway and is
the target of rapamycin. AKT is the main upstream activator
of mTOR, and its activation relieves the inhibitory effects of
the TSC1-TSC2 complex on Rheb and mTORC1, thereby
activating mTORC1 in response to growth factor stimulations.
Activated mTORC1 in turn phosphorylates RPS6KB1, a
mediator of protein translation and cell growth. In contrast,
AKT1S1, a negative regulator of mTOR, showed a decrease
in abundance, suggesting that it may function synergistically
with AKT on mTOR activation [45, 46]. Previous studies
and current data demonstrate that increased cell proliferation,
migration and invasion are characteristics of T-R cells [47,
48]. It is perhaps not surprising that inhibition of mTOR can
block the cell migration and invasion, as multiple mTOR
effectors are key players in these processes [46, 49] and RhoRac signaling is the highest ranking upregulated molecular
processes by p-value in T-R cells (Figure 3A). It is interesting
that, under our experimental conditions, AZD8055 treatment
did not seem to cause noticeable blockage of migration and
invasion in T-S cells. This result alone does not suggest that
mTOR inhibition had no effect for T-S cells, as the dosage
and treatment time may need to be optimized. Rather, our
results suggest that, among the multiple activated oncogenic
pathways, mTOR has become the dominant one that the
T-R cells are addicted to for growth and survival, and that
targeting this pathway is highly effective.
Our in vitro study demonstrated that mTOR inhibition
may be considered as a potential treatment strategy
for trastuzumab-resistant GC, and mTOR inhibitors in
combination with trastuzumab may prevent or delay clinical
resistance and improve the efficacy of trastuzumab in GC.
Our study also revealed that several other signaling pathways
are associated with trastuzumab resistance, which include
Wnt pathway, cell cycle, ECM-receptor interaction and
metabolic pathway. It has been reported that Wnt pathway
can lead to transactivation of EGFR and EMT-like transition,
and causes trastuzumab resistance in HER2 overexpressed
BC cells [50]. This is consistent with the result presented in
a previous study that resistant cells exhibited typical EMTlike phenotype [26]. Admittedly, our exploratory proteomics
studies only provide a starting point for a better understanding
of the trastuzumab resistance. As the aforementioned
pathways can also be targeted for inhibition, a combinatorial
therapy targeting multiple pathways can be explored to
overcome trastuzumab resistance in the future.

Protein extraction and peptide separation

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (8M Urea, 100mM
Tris Hydrochloride, pH=8.0) containing 1×protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for
10 min at 0 °C, followed by sonication for 1 min (2s on
and 2s off, amplitude 25%). The lysates were centrifuged
at 16,200 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants
were collected as whole cell extracts (WCE). Protein
concentration was determined by Bradford protein
assay (ComWin Biotech Co., Ltd, China). One hundred
microgram (100μg) protein from each sample was reduced
with 10 mM DTT at 56°C for 30 min and alkylated with 10
mM IAA at room temperature in the dark for additional 30
min. Then proteins were digested using the FASP method
with trypsin at 37°C in an orbital incubator [51]. Tryptic
peptides were separated with a home-made reverse-phase
C18 column and eluted using acetonitrile of different
percentage as 6%, 9%, 12%, 15%, 18%, 21%, 25%, 30%
and 35% (acetonitrile in 10mM NH4CO3, pH=10). The
nine fractions were combined to six fractions (6%+25%,
9%+30%, 12+35%, 15%, 18% and 21%) and dried in a
vacuum concentrator.

35%, then measured in the linear ion trap. Automatic gain
control (AGC) targets were 5e5 ions with a max injection
time of 50 ms for full scans and 5e3 with 35ms for MS/
MS scans, dynamic exclusion time was employed for 18s.
Data were acquired using the Xcalibur software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).

proteins were defined as background. Protein-protein
interaction network analysis was performed using the
STRING with interaction sources from experiments and
databases and the interaction score set to high confidence
(scores > 0.7), the results were displayed using Cytoscape
software.

Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was measured with Cell Count
kit-8 in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, cells were seeded into 96-well plates in 100μL
culture medium at a density of 5,000 cells/well and
incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Cells were subsequently
incubated with or without AZD8055 at the indicated
concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 nM) with
appropriate vehicle control (DMSO) as a substrate. At 48
h post-treatment, 10% Cell Count kit-8 was added to each
well, and the cells were further incubated for 3 h at 37°C.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an iMark
microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA). All experiments were
done in triplicates and repeated three times.

Protein identification and quantification

Western blotting

The acquired MS/MS spectra were searched
by Mascot 2.3 (Matrix Science Inc.) implemented on
Proteome Discoverer 2.0 or 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
against the human National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Refseq protein databases (updated
on 04-07-2013, 32,015 protein entries). The parameter
settings were as follows: the mass tolerances were 20
ppm for precursor and 0.5 Da for product ions from
FUSION. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for
protease digestion, and the minimal required peptide
length was set to seven amino acids. The search engine
set cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification
and N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionine as
dynamic modifications. Precursor ion score charges were
limited to +2, +3, +4, +5 and +6. The data were searched
against a decoy database so that protein identifications
were accepted at FDR of 1%. Label-free protein
quantifications were calculated using a label-free, iBAQ
approach [52]. A protein’s iBAQ divided by the total
iBAQ of all identified proteins in one sample was used to
define FOT, which was used to estimate the normalized
protein abundance and then multiplied by 105 to obtain
iFOT5 for the ease of presentation.

Cells were harvested at 70~80% confluence, and
washed twice with cool PBS. Whole cell lysates were
extracted using 8M urea containing 1×protease and
phosphatase inhibitor for 10 min at 0°C. Lysates were
clarified by centrifugation at 16,200g for 20 min at 4°C,
and the supernatants were collected as WCE. Protein
concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay.
A total of 20μg proteins were boiled for five minutes in
Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins
were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and
blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris, 150
mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH7.4) for one hour. The
membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies followed by TBS-T wash for 5 times, and
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary
antibody for one hour at room temperature. Proteins were
visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection
reagent.

Cell migration and invasion assays
Migration and invasion assays were performed
using 24-well TranswellTM plates containing polycarbonate
filters with an 8-μm pore size (Coring Inc., USA). Five
hundred microliter (500μL) of complete DMEM medium
was then placed in the lower chamber in the presence
or absence of AZD8055 (100nM) or 0.1% DMSO (as
control), and 2×104 cells/well suspended in 200μL DMEM
without FBS were seeded into the upper chamber. Cells
were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for
16 h (for migration assay) or 24 h (for invasion assay),
respectively. Un-migrated cells on the upper surface of

Proteome data filtering and statistical analysis
The proteins that were used for further statistical
analysis had to be detected in at least 4 of 8 experiments.
The differentially expressed proteins were selected by the
following rules: protein abundance ratio ≥ 2, or ≤0.5 for
up- or down-regulated, respectively, and p value <0.05
using paired two-tailed student test. GO term enrichment
analysis was done using WebGestalt website. All identified

the membrane were scraped off with a cotton swab, and
the migrated cells adhering to the underside of the insert
were fixed with formaldehyde for 20 min, stained with
0.1% crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature and
then visualized under a microscope (OLYMPUS, BX53,
Japan). Cells in six independent symmetrical visual fields
were counted at 100 × magnification for quantification of
the migration potential. For the invasion assay, the upper
chamber was inserted with membranes coated with 80μL
Matrigel-matrixTM (BD Discovery Labware, USA), and the
bottom one was filled with DMEM containing 10% FBS.
Cells on the membranes of inserts were fixed, stained,
photographed and counted similarly to the migration
assay. Each experiment was performed in three replicates.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed
after 24 h cell culture. Cells were washed 3 times in
PBS containing 1‰ tween-20 for 5min, and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were
washed 3 times and blocked in 1% BSA for one hour.
Subsequently, cells were incubated with primary antibody
overnight at 4°C. After washing, cells were incubated with
secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa
594 (ZSGB-BIO, China) for 30 min at 37°C. Nuclei were
stained with 1μg/mL DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
for 5 min. Finally, cells were visualized under a laserscanning confocal microscope (Nikon Ti-E, Japan) for image
acquisition. The experiments were repeated in duplicate.
