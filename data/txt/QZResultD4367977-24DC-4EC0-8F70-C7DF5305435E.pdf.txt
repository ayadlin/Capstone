ABSTRACT:
The dismal 5-year survival (<5%) for pancreatic cancer (PanCA) underscores
the need for developing effective therapeutic options. Recent studies from our
laboratory have shown that Nexrutine® (Nx), a bark extract from Phellodendron
amurense exhibits excellent anticancer activity in human pancreatic cancer cells
through inhibition of inflammatory signaling via STAT3/NFκB/Cox-2. Given the
apparent high oxidative stress and autophagic activity in pancreatic tumors, we
investigated the potential of Nx to modulate autophagy, reactive oxygen species
(ROS), and their crosstalk. Our results show that Nx inhibits autophagy and decreases
ROS generation. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy led to decreased ROS
generation and proliferation with no significant effect on apoptosis. Further, using
combination index analysis we also found that combination of late-stage autophagy
inhibitor with Nx exhibited a moderate synergistic to additive effect. Additionally,
genetic or pharmacological inactivation of STAT3 reduced LC3-II levels and expression
indicating a possible role for STAT3 in transcriptional regulation of autophagy. Since
both inflammatory and oxidative stress signaling activate STAT3, our data implicates
that STAT3 plays a vital role in the regulation of autophagy through its contributions
to the positive feedback loop between ROS and autophagy. Overall, our findings reveal
an important role for STAT3/LC3/ROS in Nx-mediated anti-pancreatic cancer effects.

INTRODUCTION

by removing damaged organelles and maintaining
their normal turnover[4, 5]. The role of autophagy in
carcinogenesis is complex with reports demonstrating
functions in tumor promotion and suppression as well
as a contribution to therapeutic resistance[6-8]. For
example, curcumin suppresses malignant glioma growth
through autophagy induction[9]. Additionally, tamoxifen
induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells through
autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress[10, 11].
Further, compared to other cancer types such as lung and
breast, a higher basal level of autophagy is observed in
pancreatic cancer cells and in later stages of pancreatic
tumor development[12].
Interestingly, a higher level of autophagy is

Autophagy is a dynamic multistep process in which
essential autophagy genes (Atg) participate in forming
double-membrane phagophores that engulf damaged
cellular proteins, lipids, and organelles before delivering
them to lysosomes for subsequent degradation[1-3].
Under normal physiological conditions, autophagic
activity is low. However, it can be induced in response to
a variety of stimuli including nutrient limitation, oxidative
stress, hypoxia, metabolic demands, endoplasmic
reticulum stress, physiological agents, inflammatory and
immunological signaling to protect cells from stress.
Therefore autophagy contributes to cellular homeostasis

accompanied by accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) during the development and progression of
pancreatic cancer[13, 14]. Many stimuli including nutrient
starvation, hypoxia, oxidative stress and some cancer
therapy drugs that induce autophagy, also induce ROS.
Further, similar to autophagy, both induction and inhibition
of ROS promotes cell death in cancer cells including
pancreatic by disrupting the redox balance[15-17]. These
data suggest a potential crosstalk between autophagy and
ROS. However, the role of this crosstalk during pancreatic
tumorigenesis is not established. It has been reported
that oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation and tumor
growth depends on autophagy [18]. Further pancreatic
tumors display elevated levels of autophagy [12]. Given
the high preponderance of oncogenic Ras mutations, drugs
targeting autophagy, ROS and their possible crosstalk
may have significant therapeutic potential for successful
management of pancreatic cancer [18].
Over 40,000 cases of pancreatic cancer (PanCA)
are diagnosed worldwide each year [19]. Only 1020% of these patients have the opportunity for tumor
resection. The majority of patients must be treated with
chemotherapy, which can lead to therapeutic resistance
and an overall median survival of < 6 months. The lack
of effective treatment options, late stage diagnosis and
development of therapeutic resistance results in a dismal
5-year survival rate of approximately 5% and this has
remained stable for several decades [20, 21]. Much
evidence shows that the development of therapeutic
resistance is due to elevated levels of oxidative stress
in tumor cells and deregulation of multiple tumor cell
survival signaling pathways including autophagy [22,
23]. Natural products provide a bountiful source of new
chemotherapeutics. Recently we reported that Nexrutine®
(Nx), a Phellodendron amurense bark extract exhibits
excellent anticancer activity in human pancreatic cancer
cells through selective modulation of inflammatory
signaling via STAT3/NFκB/Cox-2[24]. However, Nx’s
potential to abrogate autophagy and ROS remains to be
determined. Given the apparent anti-inflammatory and
anti-proliferative role for Nx, in this study, we investigated
the potential of Nx to modulate autophagy, ROS, and
possibly their crosstalk. Our results show that the effects
of Nx are associated with inhibition of autophagy and
decreased intracellular ROS generation. Quenching ROS
with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) inhibited autophagy
suggesting that depletion of ROS contributes to Nxinduced inhibition of autophagy. Further, pharmacological
inhibition of early-stage (using 3-methyladenine (3MA), but not late-stage (using chloroquine (CQ)
autophagy reduced ROS generation. Thus, suggesting
autophagosome formation contributes to Nx-induced
reduction of ROS. Remarkably, the combination of
Nx with CQ led to enhanced PanCA cell proliferation
inhibition with no significant effect on apoptosis. Analysis
of these data using isobologram analysis indicated a

moderate synergistic to strong additive activity. We also
show that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of an
inflammatory transcription factor, STAT3, is associated
with reduced expression of LC3, which suggests that
STAT3 transcriptionally inhibits the LC3 gene. These
data provide STAT3/LC3/ROS modulation as a possible
mechanism contributing to Nx-induced anti-pancreatic
cancer effects. These data support further development of
Nx as a promising anticancer agent targeting STAT3/LC3/
ROS.

RESULTS
Nx modulates autophagy proteins
We previously reported that Nx inhibits proliferation
of pancreatic cancer cells [24]. Though the underlying
mechanism of Nx’s anti-pancreatic cancer effect is still
unclear. Recent reports demonstrate the requirement
of elevated levels of autophagy for pancreatic tumor
growth. This evidence suggests that the inhibition
of autophagy may be a potential therapeutic target
for PanCA management [12, 18]. Due to this unique
characteristic feature and given that both autophagy
induction and inhibition could be associated with cell
death; we investigated the effect of Nx on autophagy.
In consideration of the high preponderance of K-Ras
mutations (>90%) in PDAC, we tested the impact of Nx
on autophagy using human pancreatic cancer cells that
differ in their Ras status [18]. We used mutant K-Ras
(Capan-2, AsPC-1, MIAPaCa-2) and wild type K-Ras
(BxPC-3) cell lines in this study.
Upon autophagy induction, light chain 3
(LC3, microtubule-associated protein) conjugates to
phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II and targets
autophagic membranes to form autophagosomes [25, 26,
27]. A cargo protein, p62, in association with LC3-II is
incorporated into the autophagosome which then fuses
with lysosomes for subsequent degradation. Therefore,
autophagic activity is positively and inversely associated
with levels of LC3 and p62 respectively. Further, the
autophagy gene Atg5 (required for autophagy) plays an
essential role in the autophagosomal membrane elongation
[28]. Therefore, in addition to examining autophagosome
formation using immunofluorescence, we measured
the levels of LC3, p62 and Atg5 as markers to monitor
autophagy following treatment with Nx [25-28].
As shown in figure 1a, following treatment with
Nx for 24h, we observed increased formation of puncta
in both Capan-2 and BxPC-3 indicating the formation
of autophagosomes irrespective of oncogenic Ras
mutation. Similar results were obtained with AsPC-1 and
MIAPaCa-2 cells (supplementary figure 1). It should be
mentioned that in MIAPaCa-2 cells, we also observed

diffuse cytoplasmic staining for LC3 in addition to the
formation of puncta (supplementary figure 1). When we
measured the levels of Atg5, LC3 and p62 under these
experimental conditions, basal levels of Atg5, LC3 and
lipidated membrane-associated LC3-II was detectable in
both Capan-2 and BxPC-3 cells (figure 1b). However, it
should be mentioned that basal levels of Atg5 and LC3II
were relatively higher in BxPC-3 compared to Capan-2
cells (figure 1b). Treatment with Nx showed decreased Atg
5 (8%) and LC3II (81%) as well as increased p62 (32%)
in Capan-2 cells (figure 1b). On the other hand, BxPC3 cells demonstrated a more pronounced Atg5 decrease
(41%) and p62 increase (71%) with increased levels of
LC3II (400%). It is noteworthy to mention that LC3II
can be generated in an autophagy-independent manner as
suppression of Beclin1 with shRNA or Beclin1-deifienct
embryonic fibroblasts do not form autophagosomes
[29, 30]. In addition, we measured p62 levels using
an independent ELISA-based approach and obtained
similar results (figure 1c). The observed autophagosome
formation could be due to increased accumulation or
a block in the later steps of autophagy (degradation of
lysosomal proteins) leading to inhibition or activation of
autophagy [31, 32].

In order to determine whether the observed
modulation of autophagic activity leads to inhibition or
activation of autophagy, we measured autophagic flux.
This was accomplished by measuring the levels of LC3-II
protein in the presence and absence of pharmacological
inhibition of autophagy with CQ, inhibitor of autolysosome
formation. As shown in figure 1d, incubation with CQ
led to ~2.3 and 4.5-fold increase in the levels of LC3-II
in Capan-2 and BxPC-3 cells respectively as compared
to levels without CQ, indicating increased autophagic
flux. However, the observed CQ-induced increased
levels of LC3-II decrease to ~0.5-fold (78% decrease) in
the presence of Nx for Capan-2 and increase to 17-fold
(380% increase) in BxPC-3 cells. These data suggest that
LC3-II is not delivered to lysosome in the presence of Nx
for degradation, which results in decreased autophagy in
Capan-2 cells. However, in BxPC-3 cells we see increased
levels of LC3-II. Although other possibilities exist, we
interpret our findings to suggest that Nx increases levels
of LC3-II possibly in an autophagy-independent manner
[29, 30]. Despite these differences in LC3-II, we observed
increased levels of p62 in both Capan-2 and BxPC-3

pancreatic cancer cells Capan-2 and BxPC-3 treated with or without Nx (150 µg/ml for Capan-2 and 60 µg/ml for BxPC-3) for 24h were

shown. B. Whole cell extracts prepared from logarithmically growing Capan-2 and BxPC-3 cells treated with low and high dose Nx (doses

cells (figure 1b). Taken together; these data suggest that
there is an increase in the basal level of autophagy due to
blockage of LC3-II turnover and a Nx-mediated decrease
in autophagic flux.

Nx enhances proliferation inhibition

with autophagy inhibitors (CQ, 25μM; 3-MA, 1mM).
Pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors did not influence
the anti-proliferative effects of Nx (supplementary data
figure 2b). Both CQ and 3-MA enhanced proliferation
inhibition when combined with Nx in BxPC-3 cells.
However, only CQ produced a significant increase in
proliferation inhibition when combined with Nx in
Capan-2 cells (figure 2 c and d). Further, analysis of these
data using isobologram analysis indicated that Nx, in
combination with CQ, showed strong additive to moderate
synergistic activity in both cell types (figure 2e and f). No
growth inhibitory effects were observed in MIAPaCa-2
or AsPC-1 cells after treatment with Nx in combination
with CQ or 3-MA (supplementary figure 2 c and d).
Taken together these results suggest that combination
of autophagy inhibitors with Nx could have additive to
moderate synergistic effects depending on the cell type.
It is reported that inhibition of autophagy can
synergize with other agents to facilitate apoptosis [33,
34]. We investigated this possibility by testing the
ability of Nx to modulate apoptosis in the presence of
pharmacological inhibition of autophagy. Treatment with

We next assessed the impact of Nx in combination
with CQ and 3-MA on proliferation inhibition. First,
proliferation of Capan-2 and BxPC-3 cells was measured
following treatment with different doses of CQ (20-100
µM) and 3-MA (2-5 mM) for 24h. As a positive control,
we treated cells with different doses of rapamycin for 24h.
As shown in figure 2a and b, both autophagy inhibitors
significantly inhibited proliferation of these cells in a dosedependent manner. Both cell types showed no significant
change in proliferation when treated with rapamycin
(supplementary figure 2a). We then assessed the influence
of pharmacological inhibition of autophagy on the antiproliferative effects of Nx by pre or concurrent treatment

incubation, cell proliferation was measured as described for panels A and B. Capan-2 (panel E) and BxPC-3 (panel F) cells were treated

autophagy inhibitors alone or in combination with Nx
showed no statistically significant change in apoptosis
under our experimental conditions (supplementary figure
3a). Although these data suggest that combination of Nx
and autophagy inhibitors may exert enhanced anti-cancer
effects, the underlying biological process is unclear.
Since cells could die through other processes besides
apoptosis, it is possible that combination of Nx and
autophagy inhibitors could trigger one of these processes
(such as necroptosis). In addition, recent reports suggest
(i) that autophagy promotes the expression of markers
associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and (ii)
the association of autophagy inhibition with decreased
pulmonary metastasis in a hepatocellular carcinoma
model [35, 36]. However, it is not clear whether Nx, in
combination with autophagy inhibitors, modulates markers
associated with EMT and metastasis in vivo.

ROS demonstrated a marginal, but statistically significant
decrease in Nx-induced proliferation inhibition of Capan-2
and BxPC-3 cells (figure 3b and 3c). Similar results were
obtained in AsPC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells (supplementary
figure 3c). These data suggest that Nx alone effectively
quenches ROS and that ROS may not play a direct role in
mediating Nx-induced anti-proliferative effects. However,
whether the observed Nx-mediated ROS reduction
contributes to autophagy inhibition is not clear.

Pharmacological approaches to decipher Nxmediated modulation of crosstalk between ROS
and autophagy
To explore the potential crosstalk between
ROS and autophagy, we measured (i) autophagy by
quenching endogenous ROS levels with NAC or (ii)
ROS levels in the presence of autophagy inhibitors. As
shown in figure 4a, pharmacological inhibition of early
stage autophagy reduced ROS levels in Capan-2 and
BxPC-3 cells. However, pharmacological inhibition
of late stage autophagy reduced ROS levels in BxPC3, but not in Capan-2 cells. Similarly, pharmacological
inhibition of autophagy reduced ROS levels in AsPC1 cells (supplementary figure 4a). Interestingly, both
pharmacological inhibition of autophagy and Nx induced
ROS levels in MIAPaCa-2 cells.
We then tested whether autophagy is required for
Nx-mediated ROS inhibition. As shown in figure 4b and
supplementary figure 4b, pharmacological inhibition
of autophagy with 3-MA or CQ reduced ROS levels,

effect of Nx on ROS generation. Intracellular ROS was
measured using CellROX® Deep Red Reagent (Carlsbad,

Nx significantly inhibited ROS levels in Capan-2 and
BxPC-3 cells (figure 3a). Under these conditions, we
observed that BxPC-3 cells were more sensitive than
Capan-2 cells. Similar results were obtained in AsPC-1;
however, ROS production was increased in MIAPaCa-2
cells (supplementary figure 3b). In order to determine
whether ROS contributes to Nx-induced anti-proliferative

although no statistically significant effect was observed
on Nx-mediated ROS reduction. We next conducted
converse studies by analyzing the levels of LC3 and p62
in the presence of NAC. As shown in figure 4c, quenching
ROS significantly reduced levels of LC3-II in Capan-2
(compare lanes 1 and 4) with no significant effect in
BxPC-3 cells (compare lanes 7 and 10). Moreover, the
observed decrease in LC3-II levels was further reduced
in the presence of Nx for Capan-2 (compare lanes 4 to
5 and 6) but not in BxPC-3 cells (compare lanes 10 to
11 and 12). It should be mentioned that quenching ROS
also marginally decreased levels of p62 in both Capan-2
and BxPC-3 cells; however, treatment with Nx rescued
the observed decrease (figure 4c). Although quenching
ROS reduced LC3 levels, treatment with Nx had no
further effect in AsPC-1 cells (supplementary figure4c).
Taken together our results demonstrate that inhibition of
autophagy decreased ROS levels and that quenching ROS

(with NAC or Nx) inhibits autophagy, thereby suggesting
a positive feedback loop. To further validate the crosstalk
between autophagy and ROS, we generated Atg5 and
Atg7 stable knockdown cell lines using Capan-2 and
BxPC-3. As shown in figure 4d, knock down of Atg5 or
Atg7 resulted in reduced LC3-II and increased p62 protein
levels for both Capan-2 and BxPC-3 cells compared to
control cells transduced with scramble shRNA. This
indicates that autophagy activation was inhibited.
We examined the effects of Atg5 and Atg7 silencing
on ROS levels, and found that silencing either Atg5
or Atg7 caused a marginal, but statistically significant
inhibition of ROS levels in both cell lines. The reduction
was more significant in BxPC-3 cells with Atg7
knockdown (figure 4e). This data was consistent with
our results indicating a potential positive feedback loop
between autophagy and ROS. Overall, our data implicates
that ROS contributes to autophagy and vice versa in these

feedback loop is inhibited is unclear.

the expression and protein level of LC3 and p62 in STAT3
stable knockdown cell lines. We found that STAT3
knockdown significantly reduced LC3 mRNA expression
and protein levels compared to scrambled control
cells (figure 5a and b). These data suggest that STAT3
transcriptionally inhibits the expression of LC3. Further,
protein levels of p62 increased under these conditions
implying inhibition of autophagy (figure 5b). Additionally,
pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 activation using
STAT3 inhibitor V (Stattic, Santa Cruz, CA) showed a
dose-dependent reduction in pSTAT3 and LC3-II in these
cells (figure 5c). These data suggest the distinct possibility
that STAT3 transcriptionally regulates autophagy
through LC3. Surprisingly, significantly elevated levels
of intracellular ROS were detected in Capan-2 STAT3
knockdowns with no significant change in BxPC-3 cells
as compared to scrambled controls (figure 5d). Taken
together these results show that STAT3 transcriptionally
regulates LC3 and that autophagy induces ROS. Since our
data demonstrates reduced STAT3 inactivation with Nx
treatment, we believe that Nx (i) inhibits autophagy by
reducing STAT3-mediated activation of autophagy (LC3;
see hypothetical model in figure 6).

STAT3 regulates autophagy
In previous studies from our laboratory, we found a
marked decrease in the levels of DNA binding activity by
the active and inactive forms of STAT3, an inflammatory
mediator, which was associated with proliferation
inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells after treatment with
Nx [24]. STAT3 signaling plays an important role, not
only in tumorigenesis but also in the development of
therapeutic resistance [37-39]. Constitutive activation
of STAT3 has been reported in PanCA patients [40].
Recently, it was reported that silencing receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE) or Atg5 using
shRNA significantly inhibited IL-6 induced autophagy and
mitochondrial STAT3 activation in pancreatic cancer cells
[41]. These data suggest the requirement of autophagy
for activation of IL-6- STAT3 signaling in pancreatic
carcinogenesis through RAGE [41]. In order to determine
whether the observed Nx-mediated inhibition of autophagy
is related to decreased activation of STAT3, we examined

DISCUSSION

fibrosis in a pancreatic cancer model which may possibly
occur through modulation of STAT3/NFκB/EP4 axis [24].
Collectively, these published studies suggest that Nx is a
promising, over the counter, herbal supplement with anticancerous activities. However, in order to develop Nx for
clinical use, the underlying molecular mechanism should
be deciphered. Accordingly, in this study, we explored
whether the anti-proliferative effects of Nx were mediated
via regulation of ROS and autophagy.
Consistent with published studies, we observed high
basal levels of autophagy in human pancreatic cancer
cells [12, 39]. Using multiple biochemical approaches
and pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy we show
that Nx inhibits autophagy. Treatment with Nx reduced
intracellular production of ROS in these cell lines
irrespective of oncogenic Ras status. It is noteworthy to
mention that the MIAPaCa-2 cell line with oncogenic
K-Ras mutation shows increased ROS production in
response to Nx. The reason for this increase is not apparent
at this time. Nevertheless, we believe that this could be
related to the poorly differentiated carcinoma status of this
cell line as opposed to adenocarcinoma in other cell types
used in the study [48]. Interestingly, production of ROS
has been reported as a stimulus for autophagy induction
[49, 50]. Further, ROS activation is associated with
tumor growth suppression [51, 52]. These data indicate
a positive association between ROS and autophagy and
suggest a potential link between ROS and autophagy in
mediating Nx’s anti-proliferative effects. Consequently,
we tested the crosstalk between ROS and autophagy using
pharmacological and genetic approaches. Pharmacologic
(via 3-MA) and genetic inhibition of autophagy resulted in
decreased ROS generation in Capan-2, AsPC-1 and BxPC3 cells, suggesting a positive feedback loop between ROS
and autophagy. Additionally, enhanced ROS inhibition
was observed when Nx was combined with 3-MA which
further demonstrated that autophagosome formation is
one of the targets of Nx. CQ, which inhibits autolysosome
formation, reduced ROS generation only in BxPC-3 cells
but not in Capan-2 cells suggesting a possible differential
crosstalk between autophagy and ROS that may be
dependent on the status of oncogenic Ras. However,
we found quenching ROS by NAC did not impact Nxmediated autophagy. This implies that despite the positive
interaction between ROS and autophagy, Nx can inhibit
ROS and autophagy independently.
It is well established that autophagy and ROS can
facilitate cell death or cell survival depending on the
nature of stimuli and cellular context [6, 53]. Given our
observation of reduced intracellular ROS levels upon
autophagy inhibition, we tested the impact of autophagy
on Nx induced anti-proliferative activities. Pharmacologic
inhibition of autophagy decreased cell proliferation and
was further enhanced in the presence of Nx. Interestingly;
the observed increase in proliferation inhibition was not
associated with apoptosis induction. These observations

The near equal rates of incidence and mortality
make pancreatic cancer one of the most aggressive human
malignancies worldwide[12, 42]. Late stage diagnosis,
lack of prognostic markers, and therapeutic resistance
are major challenges for effective clinical management
of PanCA. Evidence suggests chronic inflammation
associated with activation of inflammatory mediators
including STAT3, NFκB, elevated ROS levels, and
enhanced autophagy accompany pancreatic tumorigenesis
[39].
We discovered the promising anti-cancerous activity
for Nexrutine® (Nx), a Phellodendron amurense bark
extract, using both in vitro and in vivo prostate cancer
models [43]. These studies demonstrated the unique ability
of Nx to inhibit multiple deregulated signaling pathways
in cancer cells leading to tumor growth suppression [4345]. These published studies also observed no significant
change in the body weight of animals receiving Nx,
which is indicative of its non-toxic nature. Since then,
its anti-cancerous activity has been confirmed in other
tumor models including DMBA-TPA induced epidermal
carcinogenesis, breast, and melanoma [44-47]. In addition,
we recently demonstrated the ability of Nx to reduce

Figure 6: Hypothetical model. ROS, autophagy and

inflammation play critical roles in PanCA progression. ROS
is known to activate inflammatory transcription factor STAT3.
Our data indicates that (i) STAT3 regulates autophagy possibly
by transcriptional regulation of LC3; and (ii) treatment with
Nx inhibits autophagy and reduces ROS generation. Further,
pharmacological inhibition of ROS inhibits autophagy while
pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy inhibits
ROS suggesting a positive feedback. Our working model is that
Nx inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth by interrupting the
positive feedback loop between autophagy, ROS and STAT3. Nx
mediated inhibition is indicated by downward arrow.

are in contrast with some published studies, which show
an association between autophagy inhibition and enhanced
apoptosis [33, 53]. On the other hand, our results suggest
that autophagy inhibition synergizes with Nx (to prevent
autophagy activation) resulting in enhanced proliferation
inhibition rather than apoptosis activation. We do not
know whether prolonged proliferation inhibition can lead
to cell death through other mechanisms including necrosis
or necroptosis [54]. This requires further investigation.
In addition, recent reports suggest that (i) autophagy
promoted the expression of markers associated with
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion
in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and (ii) association of
autophagy inhibition with decreased pulmonary metastasis
in a hepatocellular carcinoma model [35, 36]. However,
it is not clear whether Nx in combination with autophagy
inhibitors modulate markers associated with EMT and
metastasis in vivo.
Our studies here divulge STAT3 as an important
link between oxidative stress and autophagy. We found for
the first time that silencing STAT3, either genetically or
pharmacologically, resulted in reduced expression of LC3
in Capan-2 cells suggesting that STAT3 transcriptionally
regulates LC3. Further, silencing STAT3 increased levels
of p62 suggesting STAT3 positively regulates autophagy
activation. Remarkably, silencing STAT3 also resulted
in increased intracellular production of ROS under these
experimental conditions in Capan-2 cells. Overexpression
and activation of STAT3 occurs in many human cancers
including pancreatic cancer and leads to tumor cell
growth, invasion, and metastasis [36, 37]. ROS is known
to activate various transcription factors including STAT3
to regulate wide variety of cellular processes including
inflammation, cell transformation, tumor cell survival,
proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis [5557]. Moreover, ROS induces the transcriptional activity
of STAT3 in autophagy activated cancer cells [57]. We
recently reported that Nx-induced anti-proliferative effects
are mediated through deactivation of STAT3 signaling
[24]. Based on these published data we suggest that STAT3
may play a vital role in (i) autophagy by transcriptionally
regulating LC3 and (ii) inflammatory signaling via ROS.
Treatment with Nx inhibits STAT3 activation leading to
transcriptional down regulation of LC3 with consequent
autophagy inhibition. Therefore, STAT3 might play a
key role as a link between inflammation and autophagy
possibly via oxidative stress. Targeting inflammatory
mediators such as STAT3, ROS, and autophagy may act
as an effective and viable strategy for pancreatic cancer
management.
It is well established that more than 90% pancreatic
tumors display K-Ras mutation, which contributes to
therapeutic resistance [58-60]. Therefore our findings
demonstrating the responsiveness of cells with and without
oncogenic Ras mutation to Nx-induced biological effects
is significant. Secondly, use of Nx has several advantages
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

including: (i) Nx’s selectiveness towards actively
proliferating cells with no toxicity in animal models [44,
46, 47]; and (ii) Nx’s ability to target multiple signaling
pathways which are often deregulated in tumors due to
its inherent complexity as an herbal extract. Moreover
we also found that CQ can enhance the anti-proliferative
activity of Nx additively. CQ is an established antimalarial
drug and is currently being used in combination with
various chemotherapeutic agents in clinical trials including
pancreatic cancer [12, 61] Further, it is important to
emphasize that Nx is currently undergoing clinical trials
in prostate cancer patients. These initial findings indicate it
is safe and well tolerated, thus signifying the translational
potential of Nx. These data strongly support its use and
warrant studies to test this potentially non-toxic novel
combination of agents in preclinical studies as an effective
strategy for PanCA management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and Chemicals
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines Capan-2,
MIAPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 (with K-Ras mutation) and
BxPC-3 (wild type K-Ras) were obtained from American
Type Cell Culture (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Capan-2 and
BxPC-3 cells with STAT3 stably knocked down were
generous gifts from Dr. James Freeman (The University of
Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX). All cell
lines except MIAPaCa-2 were grown in RPMI medium
(Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 µg/ml penicillin-streptomycin,
and 100 µg/ml Amphotericin in a humidified incubator
at 37°C and 5% CO2. MIAPaCa-2 cells were grown in
DMEM medium supplemented with high glucose, 10%
fetal bovine serum plus 5% horse serum. Stock solutions
of Nx (5 mg/ml) were prepared by dissolving powdered
Nx in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide. Doses of Nx used in
the study are shown in table 1. Monoclonal antibodies
(STAT3, pSTAT3) and STAT3 inhibitor V were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
Monoclonal antibodies for LC-3 and Atg5 (Enzo life
Science; Farmingdale, NY) and p62 were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA).

Biochemical experiments
Cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter
96 Aqueous One solution assay (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s directions
as described previously [44, 47]. Cellular apoptosis was
measured using APC-Annexin-V assay (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA). Levels of p62 were measured using p62
ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions

the manufacturer’s instructions (Enzo life Science,
Farmingdale, NY). Autophagosome formation was
determined by flow cytometry and values reported as
mean fluorescence intensity [62].

Confocal microscopy

Combination Index analysis

Confocal microscopy was performed using LC3 was
performed as previously described [24].

Capan-2 or BxPC-3 cells were treated with Nx
and CQ alone and in combination over a range of
concentrations for 24h. Following this incubation, cell
proliferation was measured. Interaction between Nx
and CQ was calculated using combination index (CI)
according to Chou and Talalay [63]. CI value of 1 indicates
additive and values lower than 1 are indicative of strong
synergistic activity.

Cytoplasmic ROS detection
Following treatment with different concentrations of
Nx, indicated cells were incubated with 5 μm CellROX®
Deep Red reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min
at 37°C. ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and values
reported as mean fluorescence intensity.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were conducted at least three times
and the data presented as average ± sd. In order to compare
treatment effects, data was normalized to untreated solvent
control. Statistical significance among different treatments
was determined by ANOVA followed by t-test and p
values <0.05 was considered significant.

Autophagy Detection
Autophagic vacuole formation was detected
using Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit according to
