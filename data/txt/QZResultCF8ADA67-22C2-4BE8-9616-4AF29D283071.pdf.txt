ABSTRACT:
Determining the mechanism of treatment failure of VEGF signaling inhibitors
for malignant glioma patients would provide insight into approaches to overcome
therapeutic resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that human glioblastoma tumors
failing bevacizumab have an increase in the mean percentage of p-STAT3-expressing
cells compared to samples taken from patients failing non-antiangiogenic therapy
containing regimens. Likewise, in murine xenograft models of glioblastoma, the mean
percentage of p-STAT3-expressing cells in the gliomas resistant to antiangiogenic
therapy was markedly elevated relative to controls. Administration of the JAK/STAT3
inhibitor AZD1480 alone and in combination with cediranib reduced the infiltration
of VEGF inhibitor-induced p-STAT3 macrophages. Thus, the combination of AZD1480
with cediranib markedly reduced tumor volume, and microvascular density, indicating
that up regulation of the STAT3 pathway can mediate resistance to antiangiogenic
therapy and combinational approaches may delay or overcome resistance.

INTRODUCTION

(FLAIR) image hyperintensity, reflective of nonenhancing
tumor infiltration [3, 4], or a re-establishment of contrast
enhancement, reflecting VEGF-independent angiogenesis.
VEGF signaling inhibitors have been shown to rapidly
decrease vascular permeability which manifests as a
decrease in contrast enhancement that does not correlate
with tumor size [5]. Upon failure of bevacizumab, very
few subsequent responses to salvage chemotherapy have
been reported [3], suggesting the emergence of a highly
treatment-resistant phenotype. VEGF signaling inhibitor
approaches have been shown to increase the invasion
of the brain parenchyma by glioma cells [6, 7]. Thus, it
has been postulated that treatment with antiangiogenic
therapy selects for the emergence of the infiltrative,
VEGF-independent components of GBs, for which current

Patients with glioblastoma (GB) invariably develop
recurrence or disease progression, limiting their median
survival time to only 14.8 months despite multimodality
therapy [1]. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal
antibody that sequesters vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), has been approved for treatment of recurrent GB
based on the radiographic endpoint of the reduction in
gadolinium-enhancement seen on T1-weighted magnetic
resonance images, defining a prolongation of progressionfree survival [2]. Although there can be a marked
reduction in the contrast-enhancing component of the
tumor, progression can be detected by either an increase
in the abnormal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery

therapies are not adequate.
Hypoxia is a predominant characteristic of GB
[8], and other investigators have suggested that VEGF
signaling inhibitor treatment can reduce the blood supply
within GB, leading to a more hypoxic environment [9].
Hypoxia has been shown to promote the attraction of bone
marrow derived myeloid cells to hypoxic glioblastoma
tumors [10]. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated

that hypoxia can induce the expression of p-STAT3 in
glioma cells [11]. STAT3 activation usually relies on
ligand-receptor interactions [12], but STAT3 becomes
persistently activated in most human malignancies,
including gliomas [13]. STAT3 activation entails protein
phosphorylation at the tyrosine-705 site (p-STAT3),
dimerization, nuclear translocation, and subsequent
binding to consensus promoter sequences of target
genes, thus initiating transcription of multiple genes
fundamental to tumor progression including preventing
apoptosis, and enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis,
and invasion [14]. Additionally, STAT3 maintains
the “stemness” of glioma cells [15], the mesenchymal
transformation of brain tumors [16] and tumor-mediated
immune suppression [17]. Finally, STAT3 has been
shown to be a key defining feature responsible for the
polarization of the tumor-associated macrophage to
the tumor supportive M2-phenotype [18]. We therefore
hypothesized that antiangiogenic therapy would induce the
expression of STAT3 expression in the glioma tumor and
its microenvironment during progression and inhibiting
its expression would enhance the efficacy of anti-VEGF
therapy.

RESULTS
Up Regulation of p-STAT3 in GB Patients During
Treatment Failure of Bevacizumab
To ascertain if p-STAT3 expression was
increased during treatment failure with bevacizumab,
a retrospectively, randomly identified group of patients
with recurrent GB for whom failed either conventional
chemotherapy (n=12) or treatment with bevacizumab
(n=8) and who had undergone subsequent resection or
biopsy, was analyzed for expression of p-STAT3 (Fig.
1A; Supplementary Table 1). For the bevacizumab-treated
patients, the tumors had been resected 30-60 days post
administration of bevacizumab as recommended by the
package insert. Patients with recurrent GB who were
treated with bevacizumab had a mean of 36.7 + 7.4%
p-STAT3 expressing cells in comparison to a recurrent
glioblastoma cohort that had never received any type
of VEGF signaling inhibitor therapy that had a mean
of 13.3 + 1.6% p-STAT3 expressing cells (P=0.0008 by
student t-test) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, based on available
specimens, there was a trend in the increase of glioma
p-STAT3 expression to a mean of 35.5 + 10.3% at
recurrence in the bevacizumab-treated patients relative
to the original, pre-treatment matched specimens that
had a mean of 14.8 + 7.6% p-STAT3 expressing cells
(P= 0.08 by student t-test) (Supplementary Figure 1).

tumor cells, but also within cells with thin, elongate, nuclei
with slender bipolar cytoplasmic processes that have the
morphological characteristics of microglia, and in the
endothelium (Fig. 1C). The nature of p-STAT3 expression
in the diffusely infiltrating component can’t be evaluated
since this is not routinely resected.

The median survival time for the NSC11 tumor-bearing
mice treated with the control was 32 days. In contrast,
the NSC11 tumor-bearing mice treated with bevacizumab
had a median survival time of 46 days, which was
statistically significant (P<0.0025; HR= 16.55) (Fig. 2A).
To ascertain whether any potential findings were specific
to bevacizumab or were a more generalized propensity
of VEGF signaling inhibitors, the pan-VEGFR targeting
agent, cediranib, was also evaluated. In the NSC11 tumorbearing mice treated with cediranib, the median survival
time was 33 days, which was significantly greater than
that of the control cohort (28 days; P=0.0021; HR = 9.38)
(Fig. 2B).
The tumors during treatment failure from either
the control group or the bevacizumab- or the cediranibtreated group were then compared (Fig. 2C). In the
control-treated NSC11 gliomas, the mean percentage of
p-STAT3 expressing tumor cells was 9.0 + 4.4% (median
6.4; range: 5.1 – 14.0; n=5), whereas in the bevacizumabtreated cohort, the mean was 24.6 + 6.4% (median 22.7;
range: 16.0 – 33.3; n=6; P=0.008 by pair comparison).
Cediranib-treated NSC11 glioma cells also showed a
significant elevation of p-STAT3 expression, with a mean
percentage of p-STAT3-expressing cells of 16.2 + 4.8%
(median 16.5; range 10.0 – 22.4; n=7; P=0.05) (Fig. 2D).
The overall comparison among the three groups of treated
NSC11 tumors indicated there is significant difference
(P=0.004 by Kruskal Wallis test).
In addition to the quantitative difference of
p-STAT3 tumor expression between the control and
the antiangiogenic therapy-treated group, there was
a distinctive difference in the pattern of p-STAT3
expression. In the control (n=5) and bevacizumab-treated
(n=6) groups at the time of treatment failure, STAT3expressing cells could be seen at the leading edge of
the corpus callosum, at the tumor margin and along the
leptomeninges. However, there were more p-STAT3positive cells diffusely infiltrating into the contralateral
caudate nucleus in the bevacizumab treatment group (Fig.
2E) suggesting p-STAT3 may be an important signaling
mediator in these highly invasive tumors.

Up Regulation of p-STAT3 in Treatment Failure
in Orthotopic Model Systems of Glioma
To determine if up-regulation of p-STAT3
expression is recapitulated in orthotopic models of glioma
at the time of antiangiogenic treatment failure, expression
of p-STAT3 nuclear expression was evaluated. Mice
treated with bevacizumab or cediranib were evaluated to
ascertain whether findings represent a more generalized
mechanism of escape to anti-angiogenic therapy. We
treated mice with intracerebral tumors with anti-VEGF
therapy starting on day 5 after tumor cell implantation.

therapeutic effects against murine tumors would be
anticipated to be marginal. As both a proof of principal
evaluation in an immunocompetent animal model and
the logistic feasibility of a combinational approach being
implemented in human clinical trials, cediranib and
AZD1480 (both owned by AstraZeneca) were tested in
the immune competent syngeneic GL261 glioma model.
Thus, C57BL/6J mice were injected with GL261 cells
and then treated with each agent or the combination for
28 days (Fig. 3A). The mean tumor volume in the control
group was 29 + 9 mm3, whereas it was 18 + 3 mm3 in the
cediranib-treated and 15 + 2 mm3 in the AZD1480-treated
group (P = 0.23 and 0.18, respectively compared with the
control group). The combination of both cediranib and

and Hypoxia
Since p-STAT3 expressing macrophages have been
shown to induce angiogenesis [19], we next determined if
AZD1480 could inhibit VEGF-independent angiogenesis
induced by pan-VEGFR blockade by cediranib. After 14
days of treatment, the vascular size of tumor infiltrating
vessels was modestly decreased in the cediranib-treated
group but was markedly inhibited in the AZD1480-treated
group (Fig. 4A). The AZD1480-induced diminution of

vascular caliber was of such degree that further reduction
was not detected in tumors treated with the combination
of cediranib and AZD1480 (P =0.015; Fig. 4B). This
indicates a switch from macro- to microvessels in the
AZD1480 group.
Since antiangiogenic therapy-induced vascular
pruning is suspected to modulate tumor hypoxia in
glioblastoma and other solid tumors and STAT-3 is known
to activate and stabilize HIF-1α [20] and promote VEGF
expression, we evaluated tumor hypoxia in tumors at

the time of control and cediranib treatment failure (Fig.
4C). Compared to control and cediranib-treated tumors,
AZD1480 significantly reduced tumor hypoxia by 71 and
66%, respectively as assessed by CA9 staining (P<0.01,
Fig. 4D). AZD1480 minimized hypoxia induction when
used in combination with cediranib where there was a
similar 69% and 64% reduction in CA9 staining compared
to control and cediranib-treated tumors, respectively
(P<0.01, Fig. 4D).

AZD1480 resulted in a marked reduction in the number of
p-STAT3+F4/80+-infiltrating cells to 32.13 + 2.13 and 25
+ 1.54, respectively (P=0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively
compared to vehicle control).

Previously treatment of human patients with
bevacizumab has been shown to induce a marked increase
in the influx of macrophages [21]. To ascertain if cediranib
similarly induces enhanced macrophage infiltration that
could be potentially blocked with AZD1480, the GL261
tumors were fluorescently labeled with the macrophage
marker F4/80 (Fig. 5A). In the cediranib-treated tumor
the mean number of F4/80+-infiltrating cells was 86.67
+ 6.65 cells/high powered field (HPF) which was a 35%
increase compared to vehicle control tumors that had a
mean number of 64.29 + 4.43 (P=0.01; Fig. 5B). There
was modest decrease in the AZD1480-treated group to
a mean of 45.25 + 4.73 and this change was statistically
significant (P=0.007). However, the combination of both
cediranib and AZD1480 resulted in a marked reduction in
the number of glioma-infiltrating macrophages to 32.13
+ 2.13 (P<0.0001 compared to vehicle control). Further
characterization of these macrophages demonstrated that
they expressed p-STAT3 (Fig. 5C) indicating a M2 tumorsupportive phenotype and that cediranib and AZD1480
in the combination treated group was preferentially
reducing this subpopulation (i.e. M2 immune suppressive
macrophages) (Fig.5D). Specifically, in the cediranibtreated tumors the mean number of p-STAT3+F4/80+infiltrating cells was 71 + 5.29 which was a 29%
increase compared to vehicle control tumors that had
a mean number of 55 + 4.34. In both the AZD1480-

Finally, since p-STAT3 has been associated with
the maintenance of stem cells, we assessed the expression
of nestin in the various treatment groups in GL261 in the
C57BL/6J background (Fig. 6A). The selection of nestin
was based on the fact that it has been used extensively as a
marker of CNS progenitors and stem cells within various
areas of the developing nervous system [22-26] but is
also expressed in newly formed blood vessels [27]. In
the cediranib-treated tumors, the mean number of nestinexpressing cells was 20.70 + 5.53 % which was similar
to the vehicle control that had a mean number of 23.47 +

DISCUSSION

rapid reduction of cerebral permeability and/or perfusion
and a subsequent hypoxic state [34]. Antiangiogenic
therapy-mediated induction of hypoxia within the tumor
microenvironment could be directly responsible for
activation of the STAT3 pathway and the chemoattraction
of myeloid cells to the tumor via STAT3-mediated
mechanisms. Tumor hypoxia, via HIF-2α, has been shown
to increase the trafficking of macrophages into the tumor
microenvironment and increase the tumor burden and
the progression of malignancy [35] potentially through
the hypoxia-induced CREB-C/EBPβ cascade [36]. Both
hypoxia and antiangiogenic therapies such as cediranib
have been shown to induce the attraction of myeloid cells
to tumors, likely via multiple mechanisms. However, at
the time of treatment failure, when this study analysis was
conducted, we did not detect an increase in hypoxia in
the cediranib-treated cohort. This does not preclude the
possibility that treatment-induced hypoxia could have
occurred earlier in the treatment time course counteracting
a potential benefit of cediranib, which has been shown
to modestly improve survival in an immunocompetent
mouse glioma model. The discrepancy of these findings
may be related to the time course in which we have
evaluated hypoxia specifically during treatment failure as
opposed to others that have evaluated hypoxia during early
treatment initiation [37]. Alternatively, these tumors may
already largely be hypoxic and subtle changes induced
by antiangiogenic therapy [38] may not be detected with
our assays. Indeed, it has been previously postulated that
antiangiogenic agents would induce a reactive resistance
mediated by the HIF-1/VEGF pathway [39]. Our results
would support this contention since STAT3 is a known
regulator of HIF-1/VEGF expression [40]. Finally, the
expression of STAT3 in the setting of failed antiangiogenic
therapy may be secondary to the induction of VEGFindependent angiogenic pathways [41] such as platelet
derived growth factor, a known inducer of STAT3 [12].
AZD1480 demonstrated a reduction in
microvascular density, likely secondary to STAT3
inhibition in the tumor vascular endothelium. However,
the STAT3 pathway has been shown to be a potent
regulator of the hypoxic pathway [20] and our in vivo data
suggests that AZD1480 may circumvent the induction of
hypoxia - a known mediator of treatment resistance to
multiple cancer therapies. Cediranib alone did not appear
to influence tumor hypoxia during treatment failure at the
times evaluated in this model system, and no difference in
CA9 expression was detected in the combination group.
Cumulatively, these data indicate that tumor-associated
hypoxia may induce STAT3 during the initiation of
antiangiogenic therapy but certainly other mechanisms
are involved.
The combination of cediranib with AZD1480 in the
treatment of intracerebral glioma resulted in suppression
of tumor growth. In the immune incompetent nude model
of NS11, the combination of bevacizumab and AZD1480

In human glioblastoma patients and in orthotopic
mouse models of glioblastoma, we have demonstrated
that one potential mechanism of treatment failure of
VEGF-targeted antiangiogenic agents is the up regulation
of p-STAT3 that is associated with tumorigencity and
enhanced progression that is consistent with the aggressive
phenotype that has been previously described upon failure
with anti-VEGF agents [3, 9, 28]. The lack of increased
angiogenesis as reflected by CD31 count and tumor
hypoxia as reflected by CA9 expression, in the setting
of treatment failure of cediranib, was contrasted by a
statistically significant increase in p-STAT3 expressing
macrophages. This data would indicate a role for the
p-STAT3 expressing, tumor-supportive macrophage (i.e.
M2) [19] during treatment failure. AZD1480 decreased
total tumor p-STAT3 cells and this was most evident in
the macrophage population. When the STAT3 pathway is
blocked in the setting of VEGF inhibition in mice with
intracerebral gliomas, glioma volume is reduced and the
additive effect correlated with inhibition of nestin and
glioma-infiltrating macrophages. This would be consistent
with the previously documented role of glioma-infiltrating
myeloid cells such as macrophages and microglia playing
a central role in the angiogenic and invasive mechanisms
of resistance by the STAT3 pathway [29] and having a
negative prognostic influence on survival [30]. This
study illustrates that anti-angiogenic failure is not solely a
property of the glioma cell but also of the tumor supportive
microenvironment, specifically the tumor-associated
macrophage that must also be therapeutically addressed.
The mechanism of activity of the combination of cediranib
and AZD1480 however is not exclusively confined to the
inhibition of STAT3 expressing macrophages in the glioma
since the combinational approach also inhibited nestin.
A role of myeloid derived cells (precursors of
monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes) in mediating
refractoriness to antiangiogenic therapy has been
previously demonstrated [31]. Refractory tumors were
associated with a significant increase of tumor infiltrating
myeloid cells relative to the sensitive tumors and these
myeloid cells were capable of promoting angiogenesis
independent of VEGF. Thus, tumors can direct the bone
marrow to increase myeloid cell production and enhance
the recruitment of these cells to the tumors [32, 33].
Although these investigators did not address differences
in hypoxia between these animal models, their data
implicated multiple mechanisms are likely involved.
Cumulatively, these findings are consistent with our
findings of increased STAT3-expressing macrophages
in the cediranab-treated cohort during treatment failure,
albeit in a derivative immune population.
MR imaging of GBs 24 hours after bevacizumab
administration have demonstrated a marked reduction in

resulted in only a modest increase in median survival.
This was not entirely surprising in this murine model,
since other STAT3 inhibitors (JSI-124 and WP1066)
have previously been shown to have their therapeutic
efficacy diminished in immune incompetent model
systems [42]. Ideally, we would have liked to determine
if AZD1480 could salvage the cediranib-treated cohort
but secondary to the rapid animal demise from the time
point of neurological symptoms to death (usually less
than 48 hours), only a single dose of AZD1480 could be
potentially administered. It would have been desirable
to test AZD1480 in combination with bevacizumab in
the GL261 model but because bevacizumab exclusively
targets human VEGF, this combination experiment
could only be done in human xenograft models that are
immunologically incompetent. Significant therapeutic
effects with anti-STAT3 agents are exerted through the
immune system; thus, the therapeutic effect of AZD1480
is diminished. In the case of the cediranib, which has
species cross reactivity, the combinational approach, as
presented, is possible. Nonetheless, we would anticipate
that the combination of bevacizumab with AZD1480
would also likely be beneficial in the setting of recurrent
GB patients.
Our human data validated the observation of
p-STAT3 up regulation during treatment failure of
antiangiogenic therapy; however, only a limited number
of patients were analyzed. The feasibility of collecting
tumor tissue at the time of bevacizumab failure is limited
owing to the relative contraindication of surgery within
28 days of administration of bevacizumab and the rapid
deterioration of these patients. This is further confounded
by a paucity of data to support a therapeutic benefit of
re-resection in the setting of recurrent/progressive GB.
Because surgery in close proximity to a recent dose of
bevacizumab is contraindicated, we can’t exclude that
during the ensuing interval that there are changes in the
human glioma p-STAT3 level. However, the murine
models do not have this limitation and regardless of
the model system or antiangiogneic therapy tested, we
consistently observed up regulation of p-STAT3 levels.
It is highly likely that other pathways and
mechanisms, in addition to the STAT3 pathway, are
also involved during treatment failure of antiangiogenic
therapy. For example, activation of proangiogenic growth
factors and increased perivascular invasion has been
proposed to contribute to tumor escape in this setting
[6]. Furthermore, it is unknown if the withdraw of VEGF
signaling inhibitors would result in the down regulation
of p-STAT3 expression in the glioma microenvironment.
The temporal relationship of peripheral blood p-STAT3
expression, treatment course, and recurrence are currently
being investigated in a prospective clinical trial in patients
receiving bevacizumab.

Drugs
Bevacizumab (trade name Avastin, Genentech/
Roche; Vacaville, CA) is a humanized monoclonal
antibody that binds to VEGF-A [43], prevents interaction
with the VEGF receptor [44], and was stored at a
concentration of 25 mg/ml, in sterile PBS at 4°C and
was further diluted in PBS immediately prior to use.
Cediranib, also known as AZD2171, was provided by
AstraZeneca and is a potent inhibitor of VEGF receptor
tyrosine kinases [45], was stored as a powder at 4°C and
formulated daily immediately prior to use by diluting in
sterile water containing 1% Tween-80. AZD1480 is a
potent inhibitor of the Jak2/STAT3 pathway [46] that has
previously demonstrated a therapeutic effect in murine
models of glioma [47].

Tumor Cell Lines And Murine Models
The NSC11 cell line was derived from a GB
patient that did not receive treatment with bevacizumab
and has been previously described [48]. NSC11 cells
were cultured in DMEM-F12 (1:1) media with B27
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA), bFGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
and EGF (sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 370 C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. GL261 cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and
grown in 10% FBS (GIBCO-BRL, Rockville, Md.). All
cell lines were grown in antibiotic-free medium and were
free of Mycoplasma contamination.
For the in vivo experiments, we used 4- to 6-weekold female nude mice strictly inbred at The University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (M.D. Anderson)
and maintained in the M.D. Anderson Isolation Facility
in accordance with Laboratory Animal Resources
Commission standards and treated according to an
approved protocol, 10-07-12132. To induce intracerebral
tumors in mice, NSC11 or GL261 cells were collected
in logarithmic growth phase, washed twice with PBS,
mixed with an equal volume of 10% methyl cellulose in
Improved MEM Zinc Option medium and loaded into a
250-µl syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) with an attached
25-gauge needle. The needle was positioned 2 mm to the
right of bregma and 4 mm below the surface of the skull
at the coronal suture using a stereotactic frame (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The intracerebral tumorigenic
dose for the NSC11 and GL261cells was 5 x 103 and 5
x 104, respectively, in a total volume of 5 µl. The mice
are monitored daily and weighed at least three times
per week during the treatment period. When the mice
developed signs and symptoms of advanced tumors such
as weight loss greater than 15%, neurological symptoms,
1044

or appeared distressed, they were compassionately
euthanized with CO2 in accordance with animal welfare
guidelines. The brain of each mouse was harvested,
fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin.
Tumor formation and the phenotype were determined by
histologic analysis of H&E-stained sections. In order to
determine tumor volume by external caliper, the greatest
longitudinal diameter (length) and greatest transverse
diameter (width) were determined. Tumor volumes were
based on computer caliper measurements of digitized
whole mount coronal CNS sections at the tumor injection
site and were calculated by the modified ellipsoidal
formula: Tumor volume = ½(length × width2) [49].
Treatment was started on day 5 after implantation of
the glioma cells, and mice were treated via intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection with 10 mg/kg bevacizumab twice a week
[50] or 6 mg/kg cediranib via oral gavage Monday through
Friday. AZD1480 was formulated in 0.5% HPMC / 0.1%
Tween 80 and administered by oral gavage once a day at
50 mg/kg Monday through Friday. These dosing schemas
are typical for murine models that have very short median
survivals compared to human patients. The control group
was treated with PBS administered by i.p. injection or
daily vehicle gavage. An IgG control group was also
treated but the median survival was no different compared
to the PBS group. Mice were treated continuously until
death and there was no interruption between dosing and
when the tissue was placed in formalin immediately after
sacrifice. The time between last dose and tumor collection
was never more than 2 days.

density in nine non-overlapping high-power microscopic
fields (at 200× magnification) from at least three different
tumor-bearing brains from each group. The expression of
Nestin was quantified by calculating the area of antibody
staining per unit area of tumor using Photoshop CS4
software (Adobe).
Microvessel density (MVD) and area of hypoxia
staining was determined by calculating the area of
CD31 (1:50 dilution, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) or
Carbonic anhydrase 9 (Ca9) staining (Novus Biological,
Littleton, CO), respectively, using the Image-Pro Plus
system version 7.0 (Media Cybernetics) in × 20 fields of
at least three tumor samples per group and three to fourth
different sections per tumor sample.

GB Tumor Staining for p-STAT3
Recurrent
GB
patients
were
identified
retrospectively whom had received either conventional
chemotherapy or treatment with bevacizumab that had
failed treatment and who had undergone subsequent
resection or biopsy at MDACC. Failure was defined as
an increase in contrast enhancement and pathologically
confirmed as recurrent tumor. The tumors were stained
and quantified for p-STAT3 as previously described [13].

Statistics
The distribution of p-STAT-3 positive cells was
summarized by the mean, standard error and range. Due
to the limited number of observations in murine models,
the comparison of p-STAT-3 positive cells was conducted
by Wilcoxon rank sum test if two samples are involved
otherwise a Kruskal Wallis test was used if there were
three-sample comparisons. Since there are multiple
comparisons among the three different groups, type I
error was adjusted based on Bonferroni correction (0.05/
number of comparison=0.05/2=0.025). In another words,
any p-value of 0.025 or smaller was considered statistical
significant in the murine models [51]. Log rank tests were
used to compare the difference between treatment and
control. A Student’s t test was used to compare the percent
of p-STAT expressing cells between GB patients treated
with bevacizumab and GB patients who had never been
treated with any type of VEGF signaling inhibitors. All
computations were carried out in SAS version 9.1 and
S-Plus version 8.

Immunohistochemical analysis
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 4µm sections
of the glioma were first deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase was
blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 10
min at room temperature. Then, the ThermoScientific
PTModule (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA) with
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was used for antigen retrieval.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the
primary antibody against p-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody
(1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), the
macrophage-restricted cell surface glycoprotein F4/80
(1:50; Biolegend, San Diego, CA) and Nestin (1:300;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The secondary antibodies used
to label p-STAT3, F4/80 and Nestin were Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G, Alexa
Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin G and
Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin
G (1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. The
expression p-STAT3, Nestin, and F4/80 were quantified
by analyzing the tumors using high-power fields (max:
x40 objective and x10 eyepiece) of each specimen. We
counted the number of F4/80 or both F4/80 and p-STAT3
positively stained cells in the area of highest tumor cell
