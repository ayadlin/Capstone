Protein Kinase D3 Sensitizes RAF Inhibitor RAF265 in
Melanoma Cells by Preventing Reactivation of MAPK
Signaling
Jian Chen, Qiong Shen, Mark Labow, and L. Alex Gaither

Abstract
RAS mutations occur in more than 30% of all human cancers but efforts to directly target mutant RAS
signaling as a cancer therapy have yet to succeed. As alternative strategies, RAF and MEK inhibitors have been
developed to block oncogenic signaling downstream of RAS. As might be expected, studies of these inhibitors
have indicated that tumors with RAS or BRAF mutations display resistance RAF or MEK inhibitors. In order to
better understand the mechanistic basis for this resistance, we conducted a RNAi-based screen to identify genes
that mediated chemoresistance to the RAF kinase inhibitor RAF265 in a BRAF (V600E) mutant melanoma cell
line that is resistant to this drug. In this way, we found that knockdown of protein kinase D3 (PRKD3) could
enhance cell killing of RAF and MEK inhibitors across multiple melanoma cell lines of various genotypes and
sensitivities to RAF265. PRKD3 blockade cooperated with RAF265 to prevent reactivation of the MAPK signaling
pathway, interrupt cell cycle progression, trigger apoptosis, and inhibit colony formation growth. Our findings
offer initial proof-of-concept that PRKD3 is a valid target to overcome drug resistance being encountered widely
in the clinic with RAF or MEK inhibitors. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4280–91. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
RAS–RAF mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade plays a central role in the regulation of cell
proliferation and survival, whereas the deregulation of this
pathway frequently occurs in human cancers (1–3). As mutations in RAS or BRAF occur in more than 30% of human
cancers, these proteins are very attractive therapeutic targets
in many cancer types. Among them, BRAF mutations occur in
about 7% of human cancers, with highest prevalence in
melanomas (66%) and thyroid (35%–70%) tumors (4, 5).
Interestingly, 80% of all BRAF mutations are concentrated
on a single substitution of glutamic acid for valine (V600E)
within the kinase domain (4). Compared with BRAF, mutations in the 2 RAF isoforms, ARAF and CRAF, are rarely found
in human cancers, which is likely due to lower basal kinase
activities (6, 7). All 3 RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS)

are found mutationally activated in 30% of all human cancers,
with highest prevalence in pancreas (90%), colon (50%),
thyroid (50%), and lung (30%) cancers (1, 2). Although the
RAS oncogene has been studied for more than 3 decades, there
is no drug on the market that sufficiently inhibits RAS, despite
extensive efforts to inhibit activated RAS with low molecular
weight inhibitors (3, 8). As an alternative therapeutic strategy,
RAF and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have been developed to inhibit the pathway downstream of RAS, and only 1
RAF inhibitor Sorafineb has been approved by Food and Drug
Administration and several inhibitors are still undergoing
clinical trials (8). However, clinical responses from these
reagents are not as effective or durable as expected, drug
resistance frequently occurs in tumors treated with RAF or
MEK inhibitors (2, 8). PLX4032 seems to be an effective RAF
inhibitor in malignant melanoma with an overall response
rate of 81%, but responsive time from patients ranged from 2
to more than 18 months and this could limit the long-term
efficacy of the drug (9). A recent report suggested that
upregulation of N-RAS and other RTK signals such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) are responsible for the acquired resistance to PLX4032 (10). Potential
mechanisms of resistant to RAF or MEK inhibitors in RAS or
BRAF mutant cancers can be attributed to either coactivation
of parallel or downstream survival pathways prior to drug
treatments or compensatory activation of alternative survival
pathways upon drug administration (11–22). In either situation, combinatorial inhibition of multiple survival pathways is
required to achieve potent antitumor effects.
RAS signaling pathway is more complex than a linear
RAS–RAF–MEK signaling cascade (1). Activated RAS protein

can interact with more than 20 effectors including RAF,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), RAC, RAL, and phospholipase C epsilon to regulate cell proliferation, survival,
and differentiation (2). There are multiple feedback loops
known to activate downstream of RAS which are differentially regulated depending on the genetic background and
tumor lineage being studied (23, 24). These feedback loops
can lead to compensatory activation of parallel survival
pathways upon drug treatments, and tumor cells are flexible
at utilizing the signal pathways for growth and transformation, resulting in rapid drug resistance. Clinical reports show
that activation of the MAPK pathway was induced via S6K–
PI3K–RAS signaling in tumor samples from patients treated
with RAD001, an inhibitor of PI3K pathway (17). In neuroendocrine tumor cells, inhibitor of RAF strongly induced
AKT phosphorylation reflecting an activation of PI3K pathway, and inhibitors of PI3K pathways induced ERK phosphorylation indicating MAPK pathway activation (25). Dual
targeting of both PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways
showed more potent antitumor effect than single treatment
alone (17, 21, 25).
Despite the intensive research efforts on RAS signaling,
our understanding of its regulation is still limited. To
identify potential modulators of RAS signaling pathways
and to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, we conducted a siRNA
screen in combination with a RAF inhibitor (RAF265) to
identify genes and/or pathways that sensitize to RAF265
treatment in a BRAF (V600E) mutant melanoma cell line
(A2058) which is insensitive to RAF265-induced cell death.
By using this approach, we identified protein kinase D3
(PRKD3) that when knocked down could enhance cell killing
by RAF265 in A2058. PRKD3 is 1 of 3 members in the protein
kinase D (PKD) family which includes PRKD1 and PRKD2.
The physiologic functions of PRKD3 are not well understood.
Similar to PRKD1 and PRKD2, PRKD3 has been shown to
function in protein trafficking and as a histone deacetylase
kinase (26, 27). One report showed that PRKD3 enhanced
CCK-mediated pancreatic amylase secretion via MEK–ERK–
RSK signaling and this process was activated by GI hormone
(28). Another report showed that PRKD3 expression levels
were elevated in human prostate cancers compared with
normal tissues; PRKD3 overexpression activated AKT and
ERK in prostate cancer cell lines and promoted cell growth
and survival (29). Essential role of PRKD3 in prostate cancer
cells is likely due to regulation of MAPK signaling (29). By
using A2058 and A375 (RAF265 sensitive cell line) as melanoma cellular models, we showed that PRKD3 inhibition
cooperates with RAF265 to prevent the reactivation of
MAPK signaling pathway, induce PARP cleavage and caspase
activity, interrupt cell-cycle progression, and inhibit colony
formation. Finally, we showed that the PRKD3 inhibition
sensitizes with multiple RAF and MEK inhibitors in a panel
of melanoma cell lines, suggesting that PRKD3 functionally
interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, PRKD3
provides a potential cancer target to develop effective therapeutic strategies to overcome or prevent drug resistance
from RAF or MEK inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Kinome siRNA synthetic lethal screen and data analysis
The kinome siRNA SMARTpool library directed against 779
kinases was purchased from Dharmacon (catalogue no. G003500). RNAi screens were prepared with 2 compound doses
for 12 plates in A2058 cells (6 plates, in duplicate). Briefly, 4 mL
of 206 nmol/L siRNAs in serum-free medium were stamped
into each well, 0.03 mL of DharmaFECT 1 in 4 mL serum-free
medium was mixed and added into each well followed by 30minute incubation at room temperature to form a lipid/siRNA
complex. Then 1,500 cells in 25 mL complete medium were
loaded on top of siRNA–lipid complex. Final concentration of
siRNA for each reaction was 25 nmol/L. The cells were
incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2. At 24 hours after siRNA
transfection, 5 mL of RAF265 was added into each well to make
the final concentration of RAF265 at 0.4 mmol/L. Cell viability
was analyzed at 72 hours post-RAF265 treatment by using
CellTiter-Glo (CTG) Assay (Promega), and data were acquired
by using an Envision (PerkinElmer). From the primary screen,
the CTG value was normalized by 1-dimensional (1D) normalization scheme based on plate median of screened 384-well
plates. The formula for calculating the 1D-normalized value
(denoted as x1D) is x1D ¼ log x0 1D, where x0 1D ¼ CTG/
medianplate CTG. The normalized Z score (NZ) was calculated
for every x1D. The formula used for calculating NZ1D is NZ1D ¼
[x1D  median (x1D)]/MAD(x1D). MAD (x1D) is the median
absolute deviation of x1D and is equal to 1.4826  median
(|x1D  median (x1D)|).
Additional Materials and Methods are shown in the Supplementary Data.

Results
A kinome synthetic lethal siRNA screen with RAF265 in
A2058 melanoma cells
RAF265 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that is
known to inhibit CRAF, wild-type BRAF, mutant BRAF
(V600E), and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and is currently
in phase I clinical trials for advanced melanoma (30, 31). As
other RAF or MEK inhibitors, RAF265 showed less efficacy in
tumors with RAS mutations compared with tumors with a
BRAF mutation (31). RAF265 also shows resistance in some
tumors bearing the BRAF V600E mutation such as the
melanoma cell line A2058. By using A2058 as the cellular
model, we conducted a synthetic lethal siRNA screen to
identify genetic sensitizers of RAF265. The siRNA SMARTpool kinome library of 779 kinases was used for the screen.
We chose to run our screen in the presence of 0.4 mmol/L
RAF265 where 20% growth inhibition was achieved, leaving a
suitable window for additional, siRNA-enhanced cellular
toxicity. As positive technical controls, we used siRNAs
targeting Polo-like kinases 1 (PLK1), which is a regulator
of mitosis and, when depleted, results in cell lethality (32).
BRAF siRNAs were used as the biological positive controls
and luciferase (LUC) siRNAs were used as the negative
controls. Duplicates were used for each siRNA and NZ were
calculated. As shown in Figure 1A and B, control LUC siRNA

centered at NZ of 0 and PLK1 siRNAs have a NZ ranging
from 17 to 28, indicating a robust signal to noise in the
screens. We considered a primary hit, a gene whose knockdown has a minimal effect on cell growth (NZ < 1.5) in the
absence of RAF265 but enhances cell killing (NZ > 4.5) in the
presence of a low dose of RAF265 (Fig. 1C). Twelve primary
hits that met our predefined criteria were identified including MGC5601, C9ORF96, ALPK1, CDC7, PRKD3, PDGFRB,
PAPSS2, PIK3R4, RAGE, RPS6KB2, DAPK1, and MAPK11
(Fig. 1C). To further evaluate the sensitizers, we generated
dose curves of RAF265 for all the hits with SMARTpool
siRNAs and observed significant IC50 shifts with 4 hits;
ALPK1, MAPK11, PRKD3, and PIK3R4 (Fig. 1D). The mRNA
knockdown efficiencies of the 4 target genes were confirmed
by quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR; Fig. 1E).
PRKD3 inhibition sensitizes RAF265 to kill A2058
melanoma cells
To prioritize hits to follow up and to minimize off-target
effects when using a SMARTpool siRNA approach, we tested
individual siRNAs of the 4 hits for sensitization with RAF265.
On the basis of the mRNA knockdown levels of the target genes,
we selected 2 potent siRNAs from the 4 individual siRNAs for
ALPK1, MAPK11, PIK3R4, and PRKD3 (left panels, Fig. 2A–D)
and measured sensitization over a RAF265 dose response (right
panels, Fig. 2A–D). Among them, PRKD3 was the only gene in
which multiple independent siRNAs resulted in a significant
IC50 shift for RAF265 and distinguished itself as the best
sensitizer identified from this study (Fig. 2D). To confirm
the sensitization observed between PRKD3 siRNAs and
RAF265, we established 3 independent stable cell lines with
inducible PRKD3 short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) expressed in
A2058 cells. The sequences of PRKD3 shRNAs were different
from the PRKD3 siRNAs used in the screen. The 3 PRKD3
shRNAs when induced with DOX resulted in 2- to 8-fold IC50
shifts for RAF265 and the sensitization correlated with protein
knockdown efficiencies of PRKD3 shRNAs (Fig. 2E). For the
control condition without DOX induction, knockdown of
PRKD3 protein levels were not observed, and the sensitization
was not significant (Fig. 2E). We showed that knockdown of
PRKD3 by using multiple siRNAs and shRNAs enhances the cell
killing effects of RAF265 in the resistant melanoma cell line
A2058.
PRKD3 inhibition sensitizes RAF265 to prevent
reactivation of MAPK signaling, induce PARP
cleavage, increase caspase activity, interrupt
cell-cycle progression, and inhibit colony formation
in A2058 cells
We analyzed pERK and pAKT levels after RAF265 treatment
with or without PRKD3 knockdown in A2058 cells. Efficient
PRKD3 knockdown was achieved by siRNA transfection as
shown by Western blot (Fig. 3B). RAF265 treatments resulted
in the reduction of pERK levels in a dose-dependent manner at
2 hours post-RAF265 treatment (Fig. 3A). However, at 72 hours
post-RAF265 treatment, both pERK and pAKT levels were
upregulated as shown with control siRNA treatments, pERK
levels were increased 1.6- to 4.2-fold and pAKT levels were

4282

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

increased more than 2-fold (Fig. 3B). After PRKD3 siRNA
treatments, pERK levels were reduced to 0.2 to 0.8, which
corresponds to a 2- to 20-fold change compared with the
condition without PRKD3 siRNA transfection (Fig. 3B). The
pAKT levels were reduced to 0.4 to 0.6, which corresponds to a
4- to 6-fold change compared with the condition without
PRKD3 siRNA transfection (Fig. 3B). In our system, total ERK
and AKT levels were not affected by compound treatment or
PRKD3 knockdown (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained
with PRKD3 shRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Collectively, we showed that PRKD3 knockdown prevented
the reactivation of pAKT and pERK induced by RAF265
treatments in A2058 cells.
To further validate PRKD3 in modulating MAPK signaling,
pERK and pAKT levels were analyzed after MEK inhibitor
U0126 treatment, with and without PRKD3 knockdown. Sensitization of the MEK inhibitor U0126 was observed after
PRKD3 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The pERK levels
were reduced at 2 hours and were upregulated at 72 hours
post-U0126 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). After
PRKD3 siRNA transfection in combination with U0126, the
pERK levels were reduced, in particular at high doses of U0126
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). Even though pAKT levels were
slightly reduced with PRKD3 siRNA transfection in combination with U0126 treatment, pAKT levels relative to total AKT
levels were not affected (Supplementary Fig. S2C). We have
shown that both RAF and MEK inhibitors tested alone were
unable to induce a sustained inhibition of pERK at 72 hours
after compound treatment. In contrast, we were able to
restore pERK inhibition in combination with PRKD3 siRNAs.
In addition, MEK and pMEK levels were found to be reduced
either by PRKD3 siRNA treatment or by RAF265 treatment
alone and further reduced after PRKD3 siRNAs in combination
with RAF265 (Fig. 3B).
Because elevated CRAF protein levels contributed to resistance to RAF inhibition in a subset of BRAF mutant tumor
cells, we tested whether CRAF levels were altered by PRKD3
knockdown (15). We observed increased phospho-CRAF
(Ser338) after RAF265 treatments (Fig. 3B), which has been
reported for other RAF inhibitors (33). However, PRKD3 siRNA
mediated knockdown had no effect on pCRAF or CRAF levels,
indicating PRKD3 affects pERK levels in a CRAF-independent
manner. We also used genetic approaches to validate the
sensitization between PRKD3 inhibition and BRAF but not
CRAF. PRKD3 siRNAs in combination with BRAF siRNA
treatments resulted in a greater growth inhibition compared
with any of the single treatment (Fig. 3C). However, neither the
combination of PRKD3 and CRAF siRNA treatments nor the
combination of BRAF and CRAF siRNAs showed potent
growth inhibition (Fig. 3C). The knockdown efficiencies of
PRKD3, BRAF, and CRAF siRNAs were validated by Western
blots (Fig. 3C).
To further understand the mechanism of PRKD3 knockdown–induced RAF265 sensitization, we analyzed apoptosis
markers, PARP cleavage and caspase activity. RAF265 alone
was not able to induce detectable PARP cleavage or caspase
activity in A2058 cells (Figs. 3B and 4A). Similar observations
were reported for MEK inhibitor AZD6244 which was shown

Figure 4. PRKD3 inhibition sensitizes RAF265 to induce caspase activity, inhibit cell-cycle progression, and colony formation in A2058 cells.
A, caspase activity as measured at 72 hours after PRKD3 siRNA transfection. Error bars indicate SDs calculated from 8 independent experiments.
B, cell-cycle profiles of A2058 cells after RAF265 treatment, with and without PRKD3 siRNA transfections. G0–G1, S, and G2–M phases are shown separately.
C, colony formation assays in A2058 cells after RAF265 treatment in combination with LUC, PRKD3_01, or PRKD3_02 siRNA transfections.

Cyclin D1 was analyzed in A2058 cells in the presence or
absence of PRKD3 siRNAs. Consistent with previous reports,
RAF265 treatments resulted in a reduction of cyclin D1, and
the reduction was dose dependent (Fig. 3B). PRKD3 siRNA
alone did not affect cyclin D1 expression, but PRKD3 siRNA
in combination with RAF265 enhanced the reduction of cyclin
D1, suggesting an interruption of cell-cycle progression
(Fig. 3B). Consistent with this observation, cell-cycle profiles
showed that PRKD3 siRNAs or 0.5 mmol/L RAF265 alone
partially blocked G2–M progression, but PRKD3 siRNAs in
combination with 0.5 mmol/L RAF265 completely blocked
G2–M progression, result in a 0% of cells in G2–M (Fig. 4B,
Supplementary Fig. S3). It was shown that PRKD3 was phos-

4286

phorylated at its activation loops during mitosis, suggesting
that PRKD3 activity is regulated in a cell-cycle dependent
manner (35). Although PRKD3 siRNAs or 0.5 mmol/L RAF265
alone resulted in a reduction of G0–G1 cell numbers, we did
not observe cooperative effects in reducing G0–G1 cell numbers (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S3). It is possible that
the cooperative effects of PRKD3 inhibition and RAF265 in
reduction of cyclin D1 is a consequence from blocking of
G2–M entry.
Finally, the sensitization of PRKD3 knockdown and
RAF265 was tested in a colony formation growth assay.
PRKD3 siRNAs or RAF265 (0.5 and 2 mmol/L) alone partially

Protein Kinase D3 Sensitizes RAF Inhibitor RAF265

siRNAs in combination with 0.5 mmol/L or 2 mmol/L RAF265
completely inhibit A2058 cell growth in colonies (Fig. 4C).
Taken together, we have shown that PRKD3 knockdown
mediates RAF265 sensitization to prevent the reactivation of
MAPK signaling, induce apoptosis markers, reduce cell-cycle
progression, and induce tumor cell growth inhibition at high
density in plastic and low density colony formation assays in
A2058 cells.
PRKD3 inhibition sensitizes RAF265 to kill the A375
melanoma cells
We analyzed a RAF265 sensitive melanoma cell line A375,
which also harbors the BRAF (V600E) mutation. A375 cells are
sensitive to RAF265 with an IC50 of 0.3 mmol/L as shown by
control LUC siRNAs transfected cells (Fig. 5A). After PRKD3
siRNA transfection, the IC50 for RAF265 was shifted from 0.3
mmol/L to 0.16 mmol/L for both PRKD3 siRNAs (Fig. 5A). Next,
colony formation assays were done. PRKD3 siRNAs or RAF265
(0.05 mmol) alone only partially inhibited A375 cell growth in
colony formation, but PRKD3 siRNAs in combination with 0.05
mmol/L RAF265 completely inhibited cell growth in colony
formation (Fig. 5B).
Similar to A2058 cells, pERK was reactivated after 72 hours
of RAF265 treatment and reduced after the combination with
PRKD3 knockdown (Fig. 5D). pMEK and MEK levels were
reduced after RAF265 treatment, and further reduced after
combination with PRKD3 knockdown (Fig. 5D). In A375,
RAF265 resulted in a reduction of cyclin D1, and the reduction
was dose dependent (Fig. 5C and D). PRKD3 siRNAs alone did
not affect cyclin D1 expression, but PRKD3 siRNA in combination with RAF265 enhance the reduction of cyclin D1
(Fig. 5D). PRKD3 siRNA transfection or RAF265 treatments
alone in A375 were not sufficient to induce detectable PARP
cleavage, whereas PRKD3 siRNA transfection in combination
with RAF265 treatments resulted in significant induction of
PARP cleavage (Fig. 5C and D). We did not see changes on
total CRAF after RAF265 treatment in A375 cells (Fig. 5D).
Instead, we observed decreased phospho-CRAF (Ser338) after
RAF265 treatments (Fig. 5D), it is likely that CRAF is an
efficacy target of RAF265 in the A375 cell line. PRKD3 siRNA
mediated knockdown had no effect on pCRAF or CRAF levels,
indicating PRKD3 affects pERK levels in a CRAF-independent
manner. In A375, PRKD3 siRNAs in combination with BRAF
siRNA treatments resulted in a greater growth inhibition
compared with any of the single treatments (Fig. 5E). However, neither the combination of PRKD3 and CRAF siRNA
treatments nor the combination of BRAF and CRAF siRNAs
showed additive growth inhibition (Fig. 5E). The knockdown
efficiencies of PRKD3, BRAF, and CRAF siRNAs were validated
by Western blots (Fig. 5E). The effects on levels of pERK,
pMEK, cyclin D1, and PARP cleavage, as well as colony
formation, after PRKD3 knockdown in combination with
RAF265 are similar in A375 and A2058 cells, indicating this
mechanism is shared by different tumor cells from the same
lineage or with the same genetic background BRAF (V600E).
These data also suggest that single agent sensitivity to RAF265
is not a requirement for combination PRKD3 knockdown–
induced cell killing.

PRKD3 inhibition sensitizes with RAF and MEK
inhibitors across multiple melanoma cells
To better understand whether the sensitization between
PRKD3 inhibition and RAF265 in A2058 and A375 cells is
shared with other RAF or MEK inhibitors across cell lines of
various lineage and genetic background, we tested additional
RAF and MEK inhibitors in a panel of 12 cell lines (Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition to RAF265, we analyzed
another RAF inhibitor PLX4032, and 2 MEK inhibitors, U0126
and PD0325901. We tested 12 cell lines including 6 melanoma
cell lines carrying BRAF (V600E) mutation (RPMI7951, IGR39,
A2058, A375, SKMEL5, and WM115), 4 cell lines bearing KRAS
mutations of various lineages (PANC1, A549, SW620, and
DU145), 1 nonmelanoma cell line with BRAF (V600E) mutation (SKHEP1, liver cancer), and 1 cell line which is wild type
for both BRAF and RAS (G402, kidney cancer; Fig. 6).
For both RAF inhibitors RAF265 and PLX4032, 6 of 6
melanoma cell lines tested showed sensitization with both
PRKD3 siRNAs (Fig. 6). Among the lines tested, 3 cell lines
RPMI7951, IGR39, and A2058 were resistant to RAF265 and
PLX4032 (Fig. 6A and C) when 2 mmol/L of compound was
used in combination with PRKD3 siRNAs (Fig. 6B and D). For 3
sensitive cell lines A375, SKMEL5, and WM115, 0.3 mmol/L of
compound was used in the sensitization assays (Fig. 6B and
D). Among the cell lines tested, the sensitization between
PRKD3 knockdown and RAF inhibitors was only observed in
the melanoma cell lines tested, with only 1 exception in which
PRKD3 siRNAs sensitized with RAF265 in colon cancer cell
line SW620. It could be that additional genetic lesions outside
of the MAPK signaling pathway are necessary for PRKD3
sensitization in nonmelanoma lineages.
For both MEK inhibitors, the sensitization was mainly
observed with melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4).
For MEK inhibitor U0126, sensitization with both PRKD3
siRNAs was observed in 5 of 6 melanoma cell lines showed
(Supplementary Fig. S4B), with 1 exception that no sensitization was found with SKMEL5. For MEK inhibitor PD0325901, 4
of 6 melanoma cell lines exhibited sensitization with both
PRKD3 siRNAs, but sensitization was not found with melanoma cells IGR39 and WM115 (Supplementary Fig. S4D). In
addition, PRKD3 siRNAs sensitized with PD0325901 in 2
nonmelanoma cell lines, SW620 and G402. Collectively, we
showed that PRKD3 inhibition sensitizes with RAF and MEK
inhibitors in multiple melanoma cell lines. Therefore, it seems
that the sensitization between PRKD3 inhibition and RAF or
MEK inhibitors is in melanoma lineage selective.

Discussion
Primary and acquired resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors
has been linked to reactivation of the MAPK pathway and
PI3K pathway. Rebound of pERK levels has been observed for
RAF inhibitor such as PLX4032 and MEK inhibitor like
PD0325901 (12, 15, 36). Compensatory activation AKT has
been reported both for the RAF inhibitor RAF265 and MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 (AstraZeneca; refs. 20, 25, 37, 38). Here, we
show that inhibition of PRKD3 sensitizes with RAF265 in a
resistant melanoma cell line (A2058) by preventing rebound of

cancer cells (29). We tested whether PKCe knockdown
can phenocopy the PRKD3 knockdown in sensitizing RAF
inhibitor. However, we did not observe any sensitization
effects (data not shown). Among the 3 PKD proteins, PRKD1
is the most extensively studied and has been implicated in a
broad range of cellular process and can be activated by a
variety of regulatory peptides (39–41). It has been shown
that PRKD1 phosphorylates RIN1 and releases it from
competing with RAF for binding to RAS, thus resulting in
an activation of the RAF–MEK–ERK pathway (42). It will be
interesting to investigate whether PRKD3 shares any function with PRKD1 such as RIN1 phosphorylation. We have
tested whether PRKD1 or RIN1 siRNAs can sensitize RAF265
in killing A2058. We did not observe any sensitization effects
(data not shown). In melanoma cells, PRKD2 protein expression was undetectable and thus it was not tested in our
sensitization studies. Even though PRKD members share
some cellular functions, they can be differentially expressed
and exert different functions (28). Further investigation of
PRKD3 specific cellular function(s) will be required to better
understand how PRKD3 ablation augments RAF265 activity
in melanoma. One limitation of our screen is that RAF265
can inhibit multiple RAF isoforms, a variety kinases, and
VEGFR (43). Similar to Sorafenib, the efficacy RAF265 in vivo
may not be due exclusively to the activity on BRAF (V600E)
(44). Thus, the sensitization seen with PRKD3 knockdown
and RAF265 could be because of a combinatorial effect(s)
with other targets in addition to RAF isoforms and VEGFR.
The lack of selectivity of RAF265 complicates the interpretation of PRKD3 knockdown sensitization and confounds

the ability to clearly define a mechanism of action at this
time.
This study is the first demonstration that PRKD3 inhibition
can sensitize with RAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF (V600E)
melanoma cells. Our current data support a model in which
PRKD3 could prevent reactivation of MAPK signaling caused
by RAF or MEK inhibitors and sensitize with these inhibitors
to kill resistant tumor cells. PRKD3 is a potentially druggable
kinase because there are known inhibitors of this class of
enzymes (44, 45). It is not clear whether the kinase activity or a
potential scaffold activity of PRKD3 is required for sensitization with the RAF or MEK inhibitor(s). Although our understanding of how PRKD3 modulates pERK and pAKT in
response to RAF265 requires further study, PRKD3 provides
a synthetic lethal target opportunity to develop effective
combination therapy to overcome drug-induced resistance
caused by RAF or MEK inhibitors.
