BACKGROUND. The purpose was to evaluate prevention of oral mucositis (OM)
using chlorhexidine compared with placebo and with oral cooling (cryotherapy)
during fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer.

METHODS. Patients with previously untreated GI cancer receiving bolus 5-FU/leucovorin chemotherapy were randomized to chlorhexidine mouthrinse 3 times a
day for 3 weeks (Arm A), double-blind placebo (normal saline) with the same

RESULTS. Among 225 patients randomized, 206 answered the questionnaire (70,
with respect to diagnoses, stage, age, sex, smoking habits, and performance status. Mucositis grade 3–4 occurred more frequently in Arm B (33%) than in A
(13%, P < .01) and C (11%, P < .005). Duration was significantly longer in B than
in both A (P 5 .035) and C (P 5 .003).

CONCLUSIONS. The frequency and duration of OM are significantly improved by
prophylactic chlorhexidine and by cryotherapy. The latter is easy and inexpensive
but has limited use, as it is drug- and schedule-dependent. The current study is
the first double-blind randomized evaluation of prophylactic chlorhexidine in a
large adult patient population with solid tumors receiving highly OM-inducing
chemotherapy. A role for chlorhexidine in the prevention of OM is suggested,

ainful sores and ulcers in the lining of the mouth (oral mucositis
[OM]) are common complications to some chemotherapy regimens. The incidence varies, depending on the chemotherapy agent
used, doses, and schedules. It is a well-known frequent complication
of high-dose chemotherapy but also occurs with some chemotherapy regimens applied in conventional dosing. Administration of
bolus infusions of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), with or without leucovorin,
has been associated with OM in 40% of patients.1,2 Grade 3–4 OM
approached 14% among 3177 patients in 21 studies using 5-FU.3
Patients suffering from the complication have difficulty eating
and swallowing. In the most severe form of OM, patients cannot eat

or drink at all and must receive nutrition and fluid
replacement through parenteral or enteral support.
OM in neutropenic patients may also represent a
clinically significant risk factor for sepsis.3 Furthermore, it may in some patients be a dose-limiting
toxicity, delaying or preventing continuation of
chemotherapy,3 which may potentially have an
impact on survival or even cure, eg, in completely
resected colon cancer patients receiving adjuvant 5FU-based treatment.
Topical cooling of the oral mucosa (cryotherapy)
may be an option in the prevention of OM.4 The theoretical rationale for this approach is that cryotherapy
leads to vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow to
the oral cavity, which reduces the exposure of the buccal mucosa to chemotherapy. Because 5-FU has a short
half-life of around 20 minutes, oral cooling for 30 to 45
minutes immediately before and after chemotherapy
administration may reduce the frequency of OM, as
suggested in previous randomized trials.5–7
The influence of indigenous normal oral flora on
OM has not been clearly delineated, but these organisms have been implicated as a potential contributing factor in the complex pathway leading to
mucosal barrier injury.3 During the ulcerative phase
of mucositis, bacterial colonization occurs with
Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. The role of such oral environmental factors as
bacteria and their products are unclear3 but have
been the rationale for involving antimicrobial mouth
rinse using chlorhexidine for prophylactic effects. An
early randomized study by Feretti et al.8 using chlorhexidine prophylactic mouthrinse reported on
reduced frequency and severity of OM, whereas later
trials have shown the effect of directly reducing the
bacterial load on the course of mucositis to be erratic.9
On this background it was of interest first to elucidate whether prophylactic mouth rinse using
Chlorhexidine has a role or not in prevention of
chemotherapy-induced OM, second to evaluate
whether it is superior or not to the oral cooling
(Cryotherapy). Thus, these 2 preventive measures
were to be compared with respect to the incidence,
severity, and duration of OM in patients treated with
5-FU bolus chemotherapy. The 2 prophylactic measures were chosen to be compared with simple mouth
rinse using normal saline to verify a prophylactic
effect of the interventional regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients had either gastric or colorectal cancer and were to receive 5-FU containing chemother-

1601

apy according to the Mayo regimen. All were
chemotherapy naive, had a healthy oral mucosa and
signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria included
a history of head and neck radiotherapy, and symptoms of any infections. The dental status had to be
sufficient good to allow for cryotherapy with crushed
ice without dental complains, ie, the patients had no
history of dental-or mouth discomfort related to cold
or hot food or beverage intake. Complete or partial
dental prosthesis was allowed.
Patients gave informed consent after verbal and
written information. The study was conducted
according to the Helsinki declaration and was
approved by the local Ethical Committees.

Chemotherapy
The antineoplastic treatment was according to the
Mayo regimen using bolus infusion of 5-FU.6 Leucovorin 20 mg/m2 bolus infusion was followed by
bolus infusion of 5-FU 425 mg/m2 daily in 5 days
every 4 weeks.
Study Design
Patients were stratified according to age (<40 vs 40
years), smoking habit (yes vs no), and the use of
dental prosthesis (yes vs no), and randomized after
informed consent to 1 of 3 prophylactic regimens
(Arm A: chlorhexidine mouthwash; Arm B: placebo
mouthwash [normal saline]; Arm C: crushed ice
[cryotherapy]). Both patients and physicians were
blinded with respect to the content of the fluid for
mouthwash in Arm A and B, which were packed
in identical 500-mL bottles labeled ‘‘X’’ and ‘‘Y,’’,
respectively.
The effect of the prophylactic intervention was
evaluated after the first treatment course at the time
when patients came for the start of the second
course on Day 28. Patients self-evaluated severity
and duration of OM together with side effects on a
questionnaire on Days 14 and 28 and were instructed
to observe and register signs and symptoms from the
oral cavity on a daily basis and write it into the questionnaires Day 14 and 28. The treating physician
made assessment of CTC mucositis grade during the
visit Days 14 and 28 in the first treatment course.
The patients assessment was the chosen endpoint in
the study because many of the items in the CTC
scale per se are dependent on the patients’ subjective
registration, eg, items such as soreness or painful erythema. NCI-CTC grading v. 2.0 of OM was used.
The patients used a similar translation to Danish of
the grading system as the physicians, neither of
which are validated.

CRC indicates colorectal cancer; Arm A, chlorhexidine mouth wash; Arm B, placebo mouthwash
(normal saline); Arm C, cryotherapy (oral cooling).

Also, hematologic toxicity was registered with
blood samples on Days 14 and 28. Patients were
allowed to continue 1 of each of the 3 prophylactic
regimens according to their own choice from the second chemotherapy course onwards, but the results of
this were not recorded as it was outside the scope of
this study.

Oral Mucositis Prophylaxis
The prophylaxis in Arm A was chlorhexidine 0.1%
mouthwash 10 mL and the patients swirled it around
in the mouth for 1 minute 3 times a day, Days 1–21.
It was without alcohol and with taste additives. The
constituent of the placebo in Arm B was normal
saline with the same taste additives as in Arm A,
and with the same mouthwash schedule.
Patients used cryotherapy with crushed ice in
the mouth from 10 minutes before until 35 minutes
after the start of each chemotherapy infusion in Arm
C. Patients were instructed in all cases to remove
prosthesis, if relevant, before the prophylactic procedures. Furthermore, they were instructed to continue
prophylaxis in case OM occurred, which was treated
according to the discretion of the respective investigators. Ice-machines were cleaned every week
according to a standardized concept and no contamination of the machines has occurred.

Statistical Methods
A 15% decrease in the incidence of CTC grade 3–4
OM was considered clinically meaningful. With a 2sided type I error of 5% and a type II error of 20% it
was calculated that 75 patients were to be randomized in each arm for a total of 225 patients. Chisquare tests were used for comparison of proportions
and the Mann-Whitney rank sum test for comparison
of continuous data.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 225 patients were randomized from 2001
to 2005, with 75 in each of the prophylactic arms.
However, not all patients returned the questionnaire
on side effects and compliance, leaving 206 evaluable
patients for analysis, including 73, 66, and 67
patients in Arms A, B, and C, respectively (Table 1).
The characteristics with respect to diagnosis, sex,
age, smoking habits, and performance status were
equally distributed between the prophylactic arms.
Most patients had completely resected colon or rectal cancer Dukes B or C (84%) and most had performance status 0 (90%). Only 11 patients were
below 40 years of age (5%), all 3 arms included
patients above 80 years, and the median ages were
similar, being 61 to 62 years (Table 1). Similarly, there
were no differences in total leukocyte count nadirs
during the first course of chemotherapy.
Compliance and Side Effects of Prophylactic Regimens
No statistically significant differences occurred with
respect to compliance to the prophylactic regimens
or to side effects such as headache or taste disturbances (Table 2). No effects on teeth were registered.

CTC indicates Common Toxicity Criteria; OM, oral mucositis; Arm A, chlorhexidine mouthwash; Arm B, placebo mouthwash (normal saline); Arm C, cryotherapy (oral cooling).

A trend toward better compliance with Arm C was
observed, with a complete compliance rate of 87% as
compared with 75% and 80% in Arms A and B,
respectively. There was a trend toward more patients
complaining of headache in Arm C (21%) compared
with the 14% each in Arms A and B, and more complaints of taste disturbances in Arm A (48%) compared with Arms B (38%) and C (36%).

Grading and Duration of OM
Only 23% of patients in Arm B did not experience
any grade of OM, whereas this was the case for 43%
in both Arms A and C (Table 3). Only 1 patient in
the entire population had grade 4 OM, being in Arm
A. The frequency of grades 3 or 4 OM were 12%,
32%, and 10% in Arms A, B, and C, respectively. This
frequency was significantly lower in both Arm A
(P < .01) and Arm C (P < .005) when compared
with Arm B, whereas Arms A and C were similar.
There were no significant differences between the
patients or the treating physicians scoring of mucositis severity.
The median durations of OM in Arms A, B, and
C were 3 days, 5 days, and 1 day, respectively. It was
significantly shorter than Arm B in both Arm A
(P 5 .035) and Arm C (P 5 .003). There was no difference between Arms A and C.
Predictors of OM
Neither smoking habits nor performance status predicted severity of OM. With respect to age, only 11
patients were younger than 40 years of age, which
hampers statistical power. However, among these 11
young patients 4 had OM grade 3 or 4 (36%) as com-

pared with 33 of 195 older patients (17%). This difference was not statistically different (P 5 .14).

DISCUSSION
Most data on the incidence of OM are derived from
clinical trials of chemotherapy regimens in which
reporting of toxicity is a secondary objective and the
frequencies reported may thus be minimum figures.
A recent review of the occurrence of OM found, not
unexpectedly, that virtually all trials were underpowered and unable to produce stable estimates of toxicity.3 The incidence of OM varied significantly among
different drugs and treatment regimens. The overall
OM rate of any grade with 5-FU treatment has previously been reported to be around 40%,1,2 whereas
administration of bolus 5-FU with leucovorin were
confined with grade 3–4 OM in 14% of totally 3177
patients (95% confidence limits [CL], 12%–15%) and
continuous infusion of 5-FU in 146 patients had a
similar 14% grade 3–4 OM rate (95% CL, 10%–18%).3
The 62% overall rate of OM reported in this
study is somewhat higher than previous reports.
Also, grade 3–4 OM were somewhat more frequent
than expected, being 32% in patients receiving placebo mouthrinse in Arm B, whereas the overall rate
of 18% (95% CL, 13%–24%) in the entire study population are close to the figures reported in a review by
Sonis et al.3 A probable explanation for the trend toward higher frequencies of OM in this study might
be that it was the major endpoint in the study, so
that underreporting is less likely, and also the finding
that the figures are based on patient self-reported
toxicity may have had an influence. It is clear from a

1604

CANCER

April 1, 2008 / Volume 112 / Number 7

previous report on patient perceptions about chemotherapy-induced OM that this toxicity is considered
very troublesome by the patients.10 Among 167
patients (32%) who reported experiencing OM of 514
patients in the analysis, 69% considered it to be an important toxicity and OM was considered the sixth most
distressing complication behind (in descending order)
fatigue, hair loss, nausea, numbness, and diarrhea.10
Cryotherapy was significantly better than mouthrinse with normal saline (arm B) in this study, both
with respect to severity (P < .005) and duration
(P 5 .003). This is in accordance with several other
randomized trials evaluating the effect of cryotherapy
prophylaxis with bolus 5-FU according to the Mayo
regimen5,6 or with other cytotoxic agents,11,12
although not all studies revealed a significant advantage for cryotherapy.13 A recent metaanalyses14 also
found that cryotherapy prevented OM at all levels of
severity with risk ratios from 0.27 (95% CL, 0.11–
0.68) to 0.63 (95% CL, 0.44–0.91).
It is interesting that the current study showed superiority of cryotherapy compared with the standard
arm (Arm B) although Arm B was not a no-treatment
arm but consisted of normal saline mouthrinse 3
times a day. Oral care has previously documented in
different randomized trials with various oral care
programs to have a beneficial effect on OM in
3 studies15–17 and only 1 study reported no effect.18
Thus, Arm B in this study cannot be considered a
no-treatment arm. Although the effect of cryotherapy
in this setting may now be concluded to be firmly
established, this prophylactic concept has some important limitations. It counts on the positive side
that it is cheap, readily available, and without severe
side effects. However, its use is very drug- and schedule-dependent. It is limited to prophylactic use with
cytostatic agents like 5-FU with a very short half-life
and to the use of such agents with bolus or very
short-term infusions. Although 5-FU is a cornerstone
of treatment for colorectal cancer, the most active
regimens are now using continuous infusion, which
is confined with a better efficacy and better toxicity
profile.19,20 This narrows down the areas of use for
this concept, but it remains of important value in a
few cytostatic regimens using bolus 5-FU and in
dose-dense chemotherapy regimens, eg, such as a
recently reported positive effect in high-dose melphalan in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell
transplantation.13,21
The situation with respect to the role of chlorhexidine is less clear. This may partly be because of
the various clinical scenarios in which it has been
tested. This includes both prevention and treatment

of OM, different treatment modalities such as radiation or chemotherapy, various cytostatic agents with
different potentials for inducing OM, conventional
and high-dose chemotherapy regimens, and various
patient populations such as adults with solid tumors,
hematologic malignancies, or pediatric patients. Also,
the variability of the mouthrinse regimens with
respect to dose, frequency, and duration may contribute to disparity, together with the often extremely
small sample sizes, making type 2 errors likely to
occur. The use of patient self-scored evaluation is in
accordance with other recent trials of OM.12,13
It is a consistent finding from 3 randomized
trials that chlorhexidine has no impact in preventing22,23 or treating24 OM in patients with solid
tumors of the head and neck undergoing radiotherapy. Likewise, in chemotherapy-induced OM chlorhexidine has failed to be beneficial as a treatment
for established OM in 3 trials.25–27 Both of these
situations are described in the recently updated
guidelines from the Multinational Association of
Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), which also find
no indications for chlorhexidine as prevention of
chemotherapy-induced OM, either in adults or in the
pediatric situation.28 The latter statement, however,
may be somewhat modified in the light of this study
and also other recent trials. Conflicting results have
been reported in older randomized prevention trials
with both positive and negative reports, eg, such as
the trials by Ferretti et al.8 and Dodd et al.,29 respectively. These studies share common methodological
problems such as low sample sizes or various chemotherapy agents confined with a high and low mucositis-inducing capacity used within the same study. It
is, however, interesting that the trial by Ferretti et al.8
was double-blinded and reported a significant reduction of incidence (P < 0.002) and severity (P < 0.03)
of OM among 40 randomized patients receiving
chemotherapy. Also, a newer unblinded study by
Luglie et al.30 in 63 patients receiving 5-FU-based
chemotherapy observed a lower incidence of OM in
the group allocated to chlorhexidine as compared
with controls, being 20% versus 66%, respectively
(P < 0.05). Cheng et al.31 compared 2 protocols of
oral care using either chlorhexidine or benzydamine
mouthrinse to alleviate OM in 40 children undergoing chemotherapy using regimens including 5-FU,
doxorubicin, or methotrexate. A statistically significant reduction in ulcerative lesions (P < 0.05) and
severity of OM (P < 0.05) in children on the chlorhexidine prophylaxis was reported. The study was
not blinded.
The findings in the 3 latter trials8,30,31 correspond
well with the findings in this study, which, however,

Mucositis: Chlorhexidine vs Cryotherapy/Sorensen et al.

is the first double-blind, randomized evaluation of
chlorhexidine in a large patient population treated
homogeneously with a single chemotherapy regimen
of highly mucositis-inducing potential. As such, the
results may indicate that chlorhexidine has a role for
prevention of OM in adult patients with solid tumors
treated with chemotherapy in conventional doses.
The price based on drug costs in Denmark equals
about €50 per treatment course lasting 3 weeks. It
may be hypothesized that the use of chlorhexidine
mouthrinse using an alcohol mixture may contribute
to the lack of effect or even harmful effect in some
radiation prophylactic trials but firm conclusions
cannot be drawn because of a lack of information on
the interventional formulation (ie, with alcohol or
not) in the reports. The current study cannot directly
address this question but may suggest that a solution
without alcohol should be preferred, such as used in
this study.
Clearly, this study could not be blinded in the
comparison to cryotherapy. Identical taste corrigents
were used in the chlorhexidine and in the placebo
arm and no obvious reason for this blinding not to
hold is encountered. However, as this was not a
crossover design, no patients have tried both chlorhexidine and placebo, for which reason it is impossible to completely rule out that a difference in taste
can be detected by the patients. Chlorhexidine does
not have the disadvantage of being restricted to use
with chemotherapy agents with a short half-life, such
as is the case for cryotherapy. However, the results
may not immediately be extrapolated to other
patient populations such as hematologic malignancies or children, nor to other chemotherapy scenarios
such as high-dose treatments in relation to stem cell
transplant programs. These situations may be the
subject of further investigations.
A new treatment concept using Palifermin (rHuKGF1), a keratinocyte growth factor receptor antibody, is now registered for prevention of OM in the
autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation
(HSCT) setting for hematologic cancers based on a
study by Spielberger et al.32 The activity of Palifermin
in the HSCT setting was further supported by the
findings in 212 hematologic cancer patients randomized to Palifermin or placebo in a recent trial by
Stiff et al.33 A statistically significant improvement of
patient self-reported OM was observed. In contrast
to hematologic cancers, some epithelial malignancies
carry keratinocyte growth factor receptors, and there
is thus a potential risk for the stimulation of epithelial tumor growth. One recent randomized trial
among 64 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
receiving fluorouracil/leucovorin bolus chemotherapy

1605

revealed statistically significant reduction of OM
grade 2 or worse from 62% in the placebo group to
29% in the Palifermin group (P 5 0.016).34 No differences in overall survival time or progression-free survival were noted but the study was not powered to
detect such differences. Additional studies are
needed to evaluate fully the long-term safety of Palifermin in the solid tumor setting.
In conclusion, the frequency and duration of OM
may be significantly improved by either prophylactic
chlorhexidine or by cryotherapy. The latter is easy
and inexpensive but is drug- and schedule-dependent, as it cannot be used with infusional 5-FU or
with chemotherapy with substantially longer halflives than 5-FU. The current study is the first double-blind, randomized evaluation of chlorhexidine in
a large patient population treated homogeneously
with a single chemotherapy regimen of highly mucositis-inducing potential. The results point toward a
role for chlorhexidine in the prevention of OM in
adult patients with solid tumors treated with chemotherapy in conventional doses, without having the
disadvantage of being restricted to use with chemotherapy agents with a short half-life, such as is the
case for cryotherapy. Whether chlorhexidine is as
effective as Palifermin remains to be evaluated.
