BACKGROUND. Evaluation of therapeutic outcomes and risk factors was undertaken for patients with primary solid tumors (PST) developing acute leukemia or
myelodysplasia (MDS) as a second malignancy.

METHODS. In all, 131 consecutive patients presenting to a single institution with
leukemia or MDS after treatment for PST with surgery or chemotherapy/radiotherapy were examined. Management of the secondary acute leukemia and MDS
consisted either of intensive therapy including allogeneic blood and marrow
transplants or supportive measures.

RESULTS. The time from diagnosis of PST to development of acute leukemia or
MDS, the cytogenetic profile of patients, and their survival were similar irrespective of PST therapy with surgery alone or strategies involving chemotherapy and/
or radiation. The median survival of all 131 patients was 10.5 months with a
5-year survival of 15.6%. Induction therapy and/or transplantation resulted in a
median survival of 13.6 months and a 5-year survival of 26.6% compared with 6.5

months and 2% with supportive measures. Subset analysis of transplant recipients revealed a median survival of 17.6 months and a 37.9% 5-year survival. Despite a significantly lower recurrence rate the survival of transplant recipients
was not improved secondary to a higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate.
CONCLUSIONS. Patients developing acute leukemia or MDS after PST demonstrated similar cytogenetic profiles and clinical outcomes independent of the
type of treatment. Survival was significantly better for patients able to undergo
intensive therapy compared with supportive measures. The low recurrence rate
for allograft recipients was consistent with a potent antileukemic effect that may
translate into a survival benefit if TRM could be reduced. Cancer 2008;112:1513–

hemotherapy and/or radiation of patients with primary solid
tumors (PSTs) may result in the later development of secondary
malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia. Large studies, particularly in breast cancer,1–8 have demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in the incidence and time of
occurrence. These differences are at least in part related to the
administration of different chemotherapeutic agents8 and differences in their dosing.9 Some common patterns have emerged for
the development of secondary hemopoietic malignancies. For
instance, alkylating agents and radiotherapy are commonly asso-

ciated with myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) characterized by abnormalities9
involving chromosomes 5 and 7 and occur typically
after a latency period of 5–7 years.10 In contrast, the
latency period after administration of anthracyclines
and topoisomerase II-inhibitors is on average 2
years, and cytogenetic alterations include more likely
abnormalities in 11q23 and the translocations t(8;21),

of patients present with complex chromosomal
abnormalities. There is less information about the
characteristic features including cytogenetic patterns
of patients developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) as a second malignancy.
The current treatment results for patients with
treatment-related secondary leukemia remain unsatisfactory.16–18 Survival data are limited and only a
few studies have attempted to evaluate patients with
treatment-related AML/MDS separately from patients
with nontreatment-related secondary leukemia.16,17
The poor response relates to a larger proportion of
patients presenting with high-risk cytogenetics,13,17
unresponsiveness to therapy, and increases in comorbidities that preclude the administration of intensive
induction therapy. Patients able to undergo intensive
induction treatment, however, appear to experience
similar complete remission (CR) rates, overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS) as patients
presenting with de novo AML.19,20 The outcome is
predominantly determined by cytogenetic risk.16,19,20
The role of intensive postinduction therapy
including transplantation remains unclear. Published
data suggest a 20% to 40% survival at 2–5 years.21–24
Few studies compared the outcome of transplants
with conservative management. A significant difference was not observed.15,24 The majority of patients
entered into these studies were diagnosed with primary MDS or secondary MDS/AML predominantly
emerging from hemopoietic malignancies. Large
series restricted to patients with treatment-related
secondary MDS or leukemia who developed after
therapy for PST are not available, particularly if their
acute leukemia/MDS emerged after surgical treatment without exposure to chemotherapy and/or
radiation.
A single-center retrospective study was designed
to capture all patients with PST who developed MDS,
AML, or ALL and presented to the leukemia and
transplant program at the Princess Margaret Hospital. The study had the following 2 objectives: 1) Characterization of timing and cytogenetic phenotype of
acute leukemia/MDS that had developed after surgical therapy in comparison to treatment strategies
that included chemotherapy and/or radiation; and 2)

Evaluation of the OS of patients treated either
aggressively, including the option of an allogeneic
transplant, or with supportive measures only and
identification of risk factors associated with outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the institutional Cancer
Registry Access Committee (CRDAC) and Research
and Ethics Board (REB). Patients presenting with
MDS or leukemia after therapy for PST to the leukemia service at the Princess Margaret Hospital were
identified retrospectively in the leukemia database.
Clinical data were obtained from the leukemia and
transplant databases as well as from the clinical hospital records. A total of 131 patients were registered
between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2004.
Cytogenetic data are available for 95 (72.5%) patients.
These included 85 of 120 patients with AML/MDS
(71%) and 10 of 11 patients with ALL (91%). Risks for
AML/MDS were expressed as defined by Southwest
Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria representing favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk as well as
risk of unknown significance.25 Cytogenetic risks for
patients with ALL were defined as previously published.26 Chromosomal changes with favorable prognosis included del(12p), t12p), high hyperdiploidy,
t(10;14), t14q11-q13); intermediate prognosis was
associated with normal karyotypes not in the favorable
or unfavorable group, t(1;19), abn (9p), del (6q); unfavorable prognosis included t(9;22), t(4;11),27,18,
abn(11q23), and low hypodiploidy.
Analyses were performed on the total cohort of
patients and on subgroups of patients based on
whether they received supportive care or intensive
therapy. Intensive therapy was defined as induction
treatment and/or transplantation. Patients were
deemed eligible for a transplant if they were younger
than 70 years old and survived 70 or more days after
initiation of remission induction therapy. The 70-day
time interval coincided with the shortest duration
from induction therapy to transplant. Age-eligible
patients with MDS proceeded directly to transplant.
Descriptive statistics such as the median, range,
proportion, and frequency were used to summarize
baseline characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate OS from the date of diagnosis
of leukemia/MDS. Estimates of follow-up were
defined as the duration from date of diagnosis of leukemia to the last follow-up visit for patients who
were known to be alive. Cox proportional hazards
regression was used to identify potential predictors
of survival univariately. An optimal multivariate
model was constructed using forward stepwise selec-

tion, using all possible data (there were substantial
missing white blood cell [WBC] and bone marrow
blast data, which affects the sample size in the multivariate model). A Fisher exact test was used to test
whether the cause of death was different between
transplant and nontransplant patients, with cause of
death defined as treatment-related versus all other
causes. All tests were 2-sided and a P-value of .05 or
less was considered statistically significant. The 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI) were provided for statistics of interest.

RESULTS
All 131 unselected, consecutive patients who presented with a second malignancy in the form of AML/
MDS/ALL (98 AML, 22 MDS, 11 ALL) posttherapy for

PST were evaluated. The median age at the time of
diagnosis of their leukemia/MDS was 64.6 years
(range, 18.0–92.2). Sixty-eight (52%) were female. The
predominant PST included carcinomas of the breast
(29.8%), prostate (16.8%), colon (9.2%), and gynecological cancers (8.4%). Baseline demographics are
shown in Table 1. The time interval from diagnosis of
PST to the development of AML/MDS/ALL was similar for patients who had received chemotherapy and/
or radiation (median, 4.2 years) or were treated solely
with surgery (median, 5.0 years) (P 5 .56). Cytogenetic
data were available for 84% of patients who received
only surgical treatment for their PST. The group of
patients managed with chemotherapy and/or radiation had data for 75%. Both groups of patients showed
a similar cytogenetic risk profile (P 5 .52) (Table 2).
The risk profile was also similar for patients with

the favorable risk category, 30% were intermediate,
and 70% unfavorable risk.

Overall Survival
Survival statistics for all 131 patients combined and
for subgroups are listed in Table 3 and depicted in
Figure 1A–D. The median (95% CI) survival of all
patients independent of their therapy was 10.5 (95%
CI: 8.7–13.2) months with a 2- and 5-year survival
(95% CI) of 24.1% (17.7%–33.0%) and 15.6% (10.0%–
24.3%) (Fig. 1A).

Seventy-five patients (57.3%) underwent induction therapy, 5 patients (3.8%) with MDS proceeded
immediately to transplant, and 51 (38.9%) were managed with supportive care. The 80 patients managed
intensively had a median (95% CI) survival of 13.6
(10.2–17.6) months and the 2- and 5-year survival
(95% CI) was estimated to be 35.2% (25.8%–47.8%)
and 26.6% (17.9%–41.2%). Twenty-three (28.8%) were
alive at last known follow-up.
The subgroup of 51 patients managed solely with
supportive measures because of prohibitive comorbidity or patient preference had a median survival
(95% CI) of 6.5 (3.7–10.6) months with a 2- and 5-year
survival (95% CI) of 7.8% (3.1%–20.1%) and 2.0%

was statistically significant (P < .001, hazard ratio [HR]

therapy was not significant for the older age group
(P 5 .32, HR for supportive measures 1.31 [0.77–3.13]).
Of transplant-eligible patients, those who received transplants were younger (median age 41.6 vs
61.6), more likely to be female (79.2% vs 60.7%), with
a higher WBC (median WBC 7.4 vs 4.6), and were
more likely to present with unfavorable cytogenetic
risk (9 of 15 5 60% vs 8 of 23 5 35% of those with
known cytogenetic risk) (Table 1). The impact of age
on OS in this generally younger group of patients
who were either transplanted or not was examined
by comparing the survival of patients below and
above the median age (56 years). An age-related difference in survival between transplanted and not
transplanted patients was not observed (P 5 .665, HR
1.33 [0.37–4.76] for ages < 56 years, P 5 .42, HR 0.63
[0.21–1.9] for ages 56 years) (Table 4).
The survival of patients who had developed leukemia/MDS after surgery did not differ from that
observed for patients treated with chemotherapy and/
or radiation (P 5 .8; Fig. 1C). In the surgical Group 24
patients were treated intensively, 14 with supportive
care. In the group of patients managed with chemotherapy/radiation 41 received intensive treatment and
18 supportive care. These distributions did not differ
significantly (P 5 .659, Table 2). The survival for
patients in both groups was not significantly different
for the patients who were exposed to intensive treatment (P 5 .32, HR 5 0.73 [0.4, 1.35]) but they were
different for those who were exposed to supportive
treatment (P 5 .33, HR 5 2.56 [1.08, 6.06]), indicating
a higher hazard for the surgical group (Table 4).

myeloablative and 4 with nonmyeloablative regimens.
The 28 patients without a donor did not receive a
transplant.
The survival was similar regardless of whether
patients received or did not receive the transplant.
Nine transplanted patients (37.5%) were still alive at
last follow-up, with a median survival of 17.6 months
and a 5-year survival of 37.9%. In comparison, 10 of
the nontransplanted patients (35.7%) were alive at
last follow-up with a median survival of 16.1 months
and a 5-year survival of 34% (Fig. 1D). Although the
survival curve for transplanted patients was almost
entirely superior to the curve for nontransplanted
patients, this difference was not statistically significant (P 5 .59). Similar results were observed for the
subset of breast cancer patients, who represented the
largest single disease category (P 5 .79) (data not
shown). There was no difference in the number of
deaths (P 5 .78) or the estimated survival (P 5 .51)
between patients with or without a transplant. However, the causes of death were different (P < .001).
Patients who underwent a transplant experienced more
treatment-related deaths (11 of 15 5 73% vs 2 of
18 5 11.1%) and fewer deaths related to recurrence (2
of 15 5 13.3% vs 12 of 18 5 66.7%). These data are
summarized in Table 5. Treatment-related mortality
(TRM) among transplant recipients included chronic
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (2), multiorgan failure (MOF) (2), renal failure (2), septic shock and renal
failure (2), hemorrhage (1), interstitial pneumonitis/
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (1), and
venoocclusive disease (VOD)/pulmonary hemorrhage
(1). TRM in patients not receiving a transplant included
sepsis due to Candida (1) and Enterococcus faecalis (1).

Parameters Influencing Survival
Several clinical parameters were evaluated to examine their impact on OS. These included age, sex, pri-

mary tumor type, therapy of the primary malignancy,
WBC, bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic phenotype,
and time from diagnosis of primary malignancy to
development of leukemia. Univariate and multivariate predictors of OS are shown in Table 6. Patients
with unavailable cytogenetic data and patients with
cytogenetic abnormalities of unknown significance
were excluded from the analysis.
Results of the univariate Cox proportional
hazards regression are presented in Table 6. Age and
number of white blood cells (P 5 .001 and < .001,
respectively) were the only statistically significant
predictors of survival, although cytogenetic risk
(P 5 .06) trended toward statistical significance.
Increased age (HR 5 1.23, 95% CI: 5 1.08–1.40),
increased number of white blood cells (HR 5 1.10,
95% CI: 1.05–1.16), increased cytogenetic risk
(HR 5 1.38, 95% CI: 0.99–1.92), and male sex
(HR 5 1.33, 95% CI: 0.91–1.94) were predictive of
poorer survival. Primary tumor therapy and time
interval between the primary tumor and development of leukemia/MDS did not influence outcome.
Multivariately, increased age (HR 5 1.27, 95%
CI: 5 1.05–1.53, P 5 .014), increased cytogenetic risk
(HR 5 1.69, 95% CI: 5 1.12–2.53, P 5 .011), and
increased white blood cell counts (HR 5 1.10, 95%
CI: 5 1.03–1.17, P 5 .003) all were predictive of
shorter survival. Because of missing data, this analysis used data from only 78 total patients. The potential contribution by missing data for the remaining

1519

53 patients not included in the model was examined
either by t- or chi-squared test depending on the
type of variable. The OS of patients with missing
data was similar to that observed for the patients
who contributed to the multivariate model (P 5 .95).

DISCUSSION
A study is presented that examined risk factors, the
therapeutic approach, and treatment outcome of
patients with leukemia/MDS after the management
of a PST. One of the objectives was to determine the
impact of the primary tumors and their management
on the timing and association with cytogenetic risk
factors in emerging leukemias/MDS. A second objective was to evaluate the role of intensive induction
therapy and consolidation with allografting in comparison to conservative therapy or supportive measures. The study was performed on a cohort of 131
unselected patients who presented consecutively for
management to a single center. The cohort was heterogeneous with respect to the PST and their therapy,
presentation, and characteristic features of treatment-related leukemia/MDS performance status and
age. Consistent with previous reports,16,17 OS of the
whole cohort was poor, with a median survival of
10.5 months and a 5-year survival of 15.6%. Differences in age and WBC as well as cytogenetic risk
contributed to survival as determined by univariate
and multivariate analysis. This has been well documented by previous studies. It is of note that 1 of the
published series of patients with treatment-related
AML/MDS, although showing the expected outcome
differences related to cytogenetic risk, demonstrated
inferior survival of each category when compared
with respective controls of patients with de novo
AML.17
As a novel observation, OS of our current study
was not influenced by the nature and treatment of
the primary malignancy. It is of note that we were
unable to detect any significant time difference from
the primary malignancy to the development of leukemia/MDS regardless of whether patients were treated
with surgery alone or management strategies that
included the use of chemotherapy and/or radiation.
It should also be mentioned that the cytogenetic risk
group distribution was similar for patients treated
with chemotherapy and/or radiation and patients
who underwent surgery alone, and that the survival
of patients who developed leukemia in both groups
did not differ. This novel observation raises the question of which contributions to leukemogenesis are
attributable to preexisting genetic instability that
may have resulted in the development of the primary

tumor compared with the administration of cytotoxic
drugs and radiation. This intriguing observation needs
to be confirmed in a larger study. A significant survival difference was observed favoring patients who
were medically able and willing to undergo intensive
therapy compared with patients managed solely with
supportive measures. By and large, patients undergoing intensive therapy were younger and presented
generally with a better performance status. We asked
the question whether or not the difference in survival
is a consequence of intensive versus supportive therapy or can be explained by differences in age alone.
The difference in survival maintained its significance
for patients younger than 65 years old who were
treated with either intensive or supportive therapy.
The difference was not seen for older patients. On
the basis of this observation it appears to be reasonable to offer intensive therapy to younger patients
presenting with acceptable comorbidities.
Further intensification of disease management
by allografting did not improve survival despite a significantly lower recurrence rate. The latter observation is consistent with a superior antileukemic effect
of allografts in the management of these high-risk
patients. Unfortunately, the benefit of better disease
control was offset by increased treatment-related
mortality. The data are in keeping with previous
reports.15,23 The high transplant-related mortality is
not surprising given the finding that the majority of
these generally heavily pretreated patients were
transplanted after administration of a myeloablative
regimen. The number of nonmyeloablative transplants in this series is too small to determine
whether or not the use of preparative regimens of
reduced intensity may result in a more favorable outcome. This strategy deserves further evaluation and
the feasibility was recently demonstrated in a study
involving 26 patients.27
