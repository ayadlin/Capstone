ABSTRACT
Lunasin, a soybean bioactive peptide, has both chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic activities. The aim of this study was to determine the
chemotherapeutic potential of lunasin against human lung cancer. Treatment
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with highly purified soybean-derived
lunasin caused limited, cell-line specific anti-proliferative effects on anchoragedependent growth whereas two normal bronchial epithelial cell lines were unaffected.
Lunasin’s antiproliferative effects were potentiated upon utilization of anchorageindependent conditions. Furthermore, NSCLC cell lines that were unaffected by lunasin
in anchorage-dependent assays exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition in colony
formation or colony size. Mouse xenograft studies revealed that 30 mg lunasin/kg
body weight per day decreased NSCLC H1299 tumor volume by 63.0% at day 32.
Mechanistic studies using cultured NSCLC H661 cells showed that lunasin inhibited
cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase interface without inducing apoptosis.
Immunoblot analyses of key cell-cycle proteins demonstrated that lunasin altered the
expression of the G1 specific cyclin-dependent kinase complex components, increased
levels of p27Kip1, reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt, and ultimately inhibited the
sequential phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB). These results establish
for the first time that lunasin can inhibit NSCLC proliferation by suppressing cell-cycle
dependent phosphorylation of RB.

INTRODUCTION

development of NSCLC is attributed to the accumulation
of mutations in genes involved in the upstream regulation
of the retinoblastoma protein (RB), such as TP53
(encoding the tumor protein p53), CCND1 (encoding the
G1/S-specific cyclin D1), and CDKN2A (encoding the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p16INK4a) [2].
Soybean has long been recognized as an important
source of high quality food protein. Soy-derived
products have received increasing interest due to their
purported health benefits, including cardiovascular
health, weight management, diabetes, osteoporosis, and
cancer prevention. [3-9] Additionally, epidemiological

Lung cancer remains the number one cause of
cancer-related deaths among both men and women in
the United States, with an estimated 159,260 deaths
and 224,210 new diagnoses being expected in 2014. Of
those diagnosed, approximately 60% will die within a
year. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for
approximately 84% of all incidences, while small cell
lung cancer accounts for 14% [1]. While greater than 90%
of the incidence of small cell lung cancer is the result of
unchecked proliferation due to acquired mutations in RB1,

observations have identified a correlation between high
levels of soybean consumption with lowered incidence
and mortality due to breast, prostate, colon and lung
cancer [5, 10-17].
Lunasin, a 43-44 amino acid peptide derived
from soybean, consists of nine consecutive aspartic acid
residues at the C-terminus, a RGD cell adhesion motif
and a helical region exhibiting structural homology to
conserved sequences of chromatin binding proteins [1820]. Although lunasin has been identified in a number of
other plants, including barley, wheat, black nightshade
(Solanumnigrum L.), rye and the ancient Aztec grain
amaranth [21-24], recent studies have suggested that
lunasin is not naturally found in cereals [25, 26]. Lunasin
has the ability to suppress transformation in mammalian
cells by oncogenes (E1A- and ras-mediated) and
chemical carcinogens 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA) and 3-methylcholanthrene, as well as DMBAinduced skin tumorigenesis in a mouse model [20,
27-30]. Further studies have suggested that lunasin
exhibits antiproliferative effects on some established
cancer cell lines, including leukemia, breast and colon
[5, 30-32], as well as acting as an anti-inflammatory in
lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages [27, 33].
Lunasin has been shown to be effective at reducing tumor
growth in mouse xenograft models of breast and colon
cancer [30, 31]. More recently, lunasin has been shown to
be able to enhance cytokine-induced anti-tumor immunity
via activation of natural killer and dendritic cells [34].
These data strongly suggest that lunasin exhibits both
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties and is
active against a broad array of cancer types.
One limitation of the in vitro studies with lunasin
over the past decade is that they have been performed
under
anchorage-dependent
growth
conditions.
Although providing a convenient and economical means
for the study of mammalian cells, plastic substrates
commonly used for anchorage-dependent cell culture
are not representative of cellular environments found
within organisms, resulting in the loss of cell-specific
architecture as well as mechanical and chemical cell-cell
communication. In addition, the majority of the studies
were performed using different forms of lunasin including
a synthetic lunasin peptide, lunasin enriched soy flour,
lunasin-like peptides or a mixture of peptides, rather than
a highly purified lunasin isolated from a natural source.
The aim of this study was to evaluate lunasin’s effect
on the proliferation of NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo
utilizing highly purified lunasin (>99% purity) isolated
from soybean white flake [18]. Our results show for the
first time that the in vitro effects of lunasin on NSCLC
is significantly higher in anchorage-independent assays,
and correlates significantly with its in vivo effects in a
NSCLC mouse xenograft model. Mechanistic studies
demonstrate that the inhibition of NSCLC proliferation by
lunasin is the result of a combination of alterations in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex
components cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 and the timing
of Akt activation by phosphorylation at S473, which acts
as a negative regulator of p27Kip1 expression. Ultimately,
this results in suppression of RB phosphorylation and
inhibition of cell cycle progression.

Exposure to lunasin over 24 to 72 hours resulted
in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation in H661
NSCLC cells when grown under anchorage-dependent
conditions (Fig. 1A). At 100 µM lunasin, proliferation
was inhibited by 48.9%, 51.1% and 57.7% after 24, 48
and 72 hours respectively, with estimated 50% inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of 103.1 µM, 86.8 µM and 63.9
µM, respectively. However, lunasin treatment of other
NSCLC cell lines (H1299, H460 and A549) and NBE
cell lines (HBE135-E6E7 and BEAS-2B) resulted in little
or no effect when treated over 72 hours (Fig. 1B). These
results indicate that lunasin exhibits cell-line specific antiproliferative activity on human NSCLC cells grown under
anchorage-dependent conditions and that lunasin does not
have any obvious detrimental effects on NBE cells.

Lunasin inhibits anchorage-independent growth
in multiple cell lines
Anchorage-dependent growth conditions are selflimiting in that they result in the loss of the normal cell
environment and do not mimic the tumor environment
in vivo. Hence we surmised that the lunasin’s ability to
inhibit anchorage-independent growth would represent
a more meaningful indication of its potential as an antiproliferative agent on human NSCLCs. Of the four
human NSCLC cell lines tested, all but one, H460,
exhibited a significant decrease in the number of colonies
formed in soft agar (Fig. 2A). H661, H1299 and A549
cells all exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in colony
formation upon exposure to lunasin, with 100 µM lunasin
resulting in 85.3% (IC501.3 µM), 65.6% (IC506.0 µM)
and 62.7% (IC5028.8 µM) inhibition of colony formation
respectively. For H661 cells, the IC50 decreased 49-fold
from 63.9 µM lunasin (anchorage-dependent) to 1.3 µM
lunasin (anchorage-independent), clearly demonstrating
an increase in sensitivity to lunasin under anchorageindependent conditions.
Although H460 cells showed no decrease in the total
number of colonies formed upon lunasin treatment, they
did exhibit a dose-dependent decrease in colony size when
exposed to lunasin in soft agar, as did H1299 cells (Fig.
4650

2B, Fig. 2C). H460 cells exhibited a 64.0% decrease in
colony size upon treatment with 100 µM lunasin, while
H1299 cells exhibited a 67.7% decrease in colony size.
The statistical significance was high (p < 0.001) when
compared to controls, with 1 µM lunasin treatment being
highly significant for H460 colony size reduction and 10
µM lunasin treatment being highly significant for H1299
colony size reduction (Fig. 2C). Both H661 and A549
formed small colonies in soft agar, and their colony sizes
were not affected by lunasin exposure (Fig. 2B). These
results indicate that lunasin’s anti-proliferative activity is
enhanced under anchorage-independent conditions, with
all NSCL cancer cell lines tested exhibiting an effect on
colony number and/or size.

To evaluate whether the inhibition of in vitro
anchorage-independent growth of NSCLCs can be
recapitulated in vivo, we established tumor xenografts by
subcutaneous implantation of H1299 cells in nude mice.
Cancer cell implantation was followed by concurrent
and subsequent daily IP injections of lunasin (30 mg/kg
body weight). Whereas all mice in the vehicle control and
lunasin treated cohorts exhibited tumor growth, the growth
rate and size of tumors differed significantly between the
two groups. Tumor growth was palpable in both study
groups by day 18 post initiation, but the tumors in the
control group grew at a much faster rate. By day 32 post
initiation, tumor volume in the control group averaged
455 mm3, while tumor volume in the lunasin-treated
group averaged 166 mm3, representing a decrease of 63%
in tumor volume (Fig. 3). This demonstrates a significant

on H661 cells with respect to the induction of apoptosis.
Although lunasin exposure resulted in a dose-dependent
inhibition of proliferation in H661 cells (Fig. 1A, Fig.
2A), no gross morphological changes were noted that
would otherwise suggest apoptosis or necrosis (Fig. 4A).
While exposure of H661 cells to 1 µM staurosporine for
6 hours under anchorage-dependent conditions resulted in
the characteristic morphological changes associated with
apoptosis (rounding and blebbing), treatment of these
cells with 100 µM lunasin for 24 hours resulted only in a
decrease in cell number (Fig. 4A, Fig. 1A).
To further establish that lunasin’s effect on H661
cells is not related to apoptosis, immunofluorescent

Our initial studies demonstrated that lunasin
inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo.
To begin determining the mechanisms whereby lunasin
inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, we investigated the
molecular basis of lunasin sensitivity in H661 cells grown
in adherent culture. We first assessed the effects of lunasin

method where an annexin conjugate AnnCy3, binding
externalized phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane,
and 6-CFDA, a non-fluorescent compound that enters cells
and is subsequently hydrolyzed by esterases in living cells
to produce the fluorescent compound 6-carboxyfluorescein
(6-CF), was used to discriminate between early apoptotic,
necrotic, and living cells. Under this scheme, live cells
are only 6-CF positive, necrotic cells are only AnnCy3
positive, and early apoptotic cells are both 6-CF and
AnnCy3 positive. As shown in Fig. 4B, H661 cells
exposed to 1 µM staurosporine for 4 hours were both
6-CF and AnnCy3 positive, indicating that they are in
the throes of early apoptosis. Furthermore, the early
apoptotic morphological characteristic of rounding was
present in staurosporine treated cells (Fig. 4B composite).
However, control cells and cells exposed to 100 µM
lunasin for 24 hours were only 6-CF positive, indicating
apoptosis was not induced. Additionally, no morphological
changes associated with apoptosis were observed (Fig.
4B composite). These results indicate that lunasin’s antiproliferative activity is not significantly mediated by an
apoptotic mechanism in H661 cells.

To determine if alterations in the progression of
the cell cycle were responsible for the observed antiproliferative effects of lunasin on H661 cells under
anchorage-dependent growth conditions, cell cycle
analyses using BrdU incorporation and flow cytometry
were performed. Asynchronous cultures of H661 cells
exhibited typical cell cycle distribution with the majority
of cells residing in G1 at any given time (Fig. 5A). It
should be noted that cancer cells, unlike normal cells,
have developed mechanisms to avoid quiescence due
to the lack of mitogenic stimuli and evade anti-growth
signals that would otherwise result in suppression of
their growth. Serum starvation for 72 hours resulted in
increased numbers of cells residing G1 (52.4% to 66.6%)
and a decrease in the cells in S phase (34.4% to 17.6%,
Fig. 5A-B). Thus, H661 cells did not exhibit complete
synchronization. Synchronized control cultures of H661
cells exhibited an inception to progress from G1 to S phase
of the cell cycle at approximately 15 hours post release, as
evidenced by the concomitant decrease in the proportion

on H661 cells under anchorage-dependent growth conditions in order to determine if lunasin’s anti-proliferative activity is due to alterations
in the cell cycle. Cultures were synchronized by serum starvation for 72 hours, treated with vehicle or 100 µM lunasin for 4 hours, and
subsequently re-stimulated with medium containing 10 % serum in the presence of vehicle or 100 µM lunasin. After indicated times,
cells were pulsed for 30 minutes with BrdU and prepared for analysis by flow cytometry. Asynchronous, pulsed control cells were used
for standardization. A) Representative flow cytometry dot blot and histogram for asynchronous cultures and histograms for synchronized

of cells in G1, from 66.6% to 56.7%, and increase in
the proportion of cells in S phase, from 17.6% to 27.3%
(Fig.5A-B ). Cells treated with 100 µM lunasin exhibited
a delay in this inception to progress through the cell cycle
(Fig. 5A-B ). At 27 hours post release, lunasin exposed
cells exhibited the simultaneous decrease in proportion of
cells in G1 (64.6% to 55.4%) and increase in proportion
of cells in S phase (18.0% to 25.5%). This represents an
approximate 12 hour delay in the progression of the cell
cycle due to lunasin exposure. These results indicate that
the anti-proliferative activity of lunasin on H661 cells is
primarily due to an inhibition of the progression of the cell
cycle at the G1/S phase interface.

Whereas RB in control cells began to undergo specific
serine phosphorylation by 6 to 9 hours post release, RB
phosphorylation in lunasin exposed cells failed to begin
until 18, 21, and 24 hours post release at S780, S807/811,
and S608, respectively (Fig. 6A-B). This represents a
delay in phosphorylation by as much as 15 hours when
compared to control cells, indicating lunasin treatment
results in a suppression of the phosphorylation of RB.
Various cyclin-CDK complexes are responsible
for phosphorylating RB throughout the cell cycle, with
cyclin D1-CDK 4/6 complex performing the initial
phosphorylation in G1. Synchronized control cultures
of H661 cells exhibited an increase in the expression of
cyclin D1 beginning at 3 hours post release (Fig. 7A-B,).
By 6 hours, the level of expression had increased 6.3 fold,
with a maximum of a 7.9 fold increase noted at 9 hours
post release. However, cells released in the presence of
lunasin did not exhibit an increase in cyclin D1 until
18 post release, with a maximum 6.4 fold increase
noted at 21 hours post release. This represents a delay
of 15 hours in the expression of cyclin D1. Analyses of
cyclin D1 T286 phosphorylation, which targets cyclin
D1 for degradation, demonstrated that although delayed
in lunasin-treated H661 cells, the relative timing and
level of T286 phosphorylation with respect to cyclin D1
accumulation were similar in control and lunasin-treated
cells (Fig. 7A-B). This indicates that the primary effects
of lunasin on cyclin D1 accumulation are related to
modulating expression and that degradation pathways are
not significantly affected.
We observed a similar delay in CDK4 expression

Lunasin alters the expression and phosphorylation
of key proteins involved in the G1/S phase
transition
To elucidate the mechanism by which lunasin
delays progression of the cell cycle at the G1/S phase
interface, immunoblot analyses of key cell cycle
proteins involved in the transition from G1 to S phase
were performed. Since phosphorylation of RB is the
key step in initiating progression from G1 to S phase,
evaluation of its phosphorylation served as a starting
point. Evaluation of various early RB phosphorylation
sites revealed a correlation between RB phosphorylation
and the progression to S phase for both control and
lunasin exposed cells (Fig. 6A). However, an alteration
in the timing of this phosphorylation was noted.

Figure 6: Lunasin alters the phosphorylation of RB. Synchronized H661 cultures grown under anchorage-dependent growth

conditions were treated with vehicle or 100 µM lunasin for 4 hours, and subsequently re-stimulated with medium containing 10 % serum
in the presence of vehicle or 100 µM lunasin. Cells were harvested at the indicated times and protein extracts were isolated and subjected
to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. A) Representative immunoblots of vehicle control and 100 µM lunasin exposed H661 cells

in lunasin-treated cells compared to control cells. CDK4
and CDK6 expression in control cells exhibited an
increase in expression beginning between 3 to 6 hour
post release (Fig. 7A-B,). The expression levels increased
approximately 2 fold by 9 and 12 hours for CDK4 and
CDK6 respectively, and remained relatively stable over
the remaining 30 hours post release. However, levels of
CDK4 in cells released in the presence of lunasin remained
relatively unchanged until approximately 21 hours post
release. By 30 hours post release, both kinases exhibited
a 1.7 fold increase in their expression levels (Fig. 7A-B).
These results indicate that lunasin’s suppressive effects
on the phosphorylation of RB are due, at least in part, to
alterations in the expression of the subunits of the cyclin
D1-CDK 4/6 complex.
In addition to transcriptional regulation, cyclin D1/
CDK activities are regulated by two families of CDKIs:

INK4 and Cip/Kip inhibitors. Synchronized control
cultures of H661 cells did not exhibit a change from base
level expression of p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c or p19INK4d
over 30 hours post release (data not shown). This was also
the true for cells released in the presence of lunasin, with
no significant difference being noted when compared to
controls. Of note, alterations in p16INK4a expression were
not expected as H661 cells contain a mutated form of this
protein with a reduced half-life [35]. These results indicate
that aberrations in the expression levels of the INK4
family of CDKIs are not involved in lunasin’s effect on
the progression of the cell cycle.
P21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 are also potent CDKIs.
Specifically, p21Waf1/Cip1 binds to cyclin D1-CDK4 complex
(at high stoichiometric ratios), and p27Kip1 binds to cyclin
D1 or cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, inhibiting their activity.
Thus, high expression levels of either CDKI lead to cell

cycle arrest in G1. No variations of p21Waf1/Cip1 expression
levels were observed in synchronized cultures of H661
cells released in the presence of vehicle or lunasin,
(Fig.8A-B). This is not unexpected considering H661 cells
express a mutated form of p53, and hence express low,
non-inducible levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 [36, 37]. On the other
hand, expression levels of p27Kip1 were significantly altered
in lunasin exposed cells when compared to untreated
controls (Fig.8A-B,). Synchronized control cultures of
H661 cells exhibited an initial decrease in p27Kip1 levels by
approximately 12 hours post release, with a 2.8 fold lower
expression level being noted at 30 hours post release.
The declining level of p27Kip1 correlates with increased
phosphorylation of RB and subsequent progression to
S phase in control cells (Fig.6A). In contrast, p27Kip1
levels were elevated in lunasin exposed cells compared
to control, and these levels remained constant over 30
hours post release (Fig. 8A-B). These results indicate the
suppression of NSCLC cell cycle by lunasin is mediated
through the stabilization of the CDKI p27Kip1.
To further delineate lunasin’s effect upon the levels
of p27Kip1, the expression and timing of Akt activation by
phosphorylation at S473, which subsequently acts as a
negative regulator of p27Kip1 expression, were evaluated
[38-41]. Synchronized cultures of both control and lunasin
treated H661 cells exhibited very similar, steady state

levels of Akt (Fig. 8A-B). However, when phosphorylation
of Akt at S473 was examined, control cultures exhibited
an initial jump at 2 hours post release, representing a 7.7
fold increase in phosphorylation (Fig. 8A-B,). This jumped
to a 17.5 fold increase at 3 hours post release before restabilizing at 6 hours post release to approximately a 3
fold increase from the initial zero time point. Following
this initial spike in phosphorylation, which is likely due
to the initial re-stimulation with serum, a subsequent
increase in p-Akt (S473) began at 12 hours post release.
This progressed to a maximum of an 8.6 fold increase by
24 hours post release that remained stable to 30 hours post
release. Although cells exposed to lunasin also exhibited
an initial spike in phosphorylated Akt at S473, this
increase was considerably lower than in control cells (1.8
to 14.1 fold less at 2 to 3 hours post release respectively
when compared to control cells). Also, lunasin treated
cells stabilized to approximately a 3-fold increase from
the initial zero time point sooner than control cells (3 and
6 hours post release respectively) and failed to exhibit a
significant increase in Akt phosphorylation at 18 hours as
seen in control cells (8A-B). The onset at 12 hours post
release and continued increase of Akt phosphorylation in
control cells correlates with the initiation and continued
decline of p27Kip1 levels, consistent with the negative
regulation of p27Kip1 by p-Akt (S473). In addition, the

lack of increase in p-Akt (S473) in lunasin exposed cells
(other than due to initial increase due to re-stimulation
with serum at 2 hours) correlates with the lack of decline
in p27Kip1. These results suggest that lunasin inhibits the
negative regulation of p27Kip1 through inhibiting Akt
phosphorylation.

is the result of the stabilization of p27Kip1levels, inhibition
of cyclin D1/CDK expression levels, and ultimately, the
delay and suppression of RB phosphorylation. This is
consistent with the aforementioned studies on lunasin
affects in colon cancer cells where cell cycle arrest
was associated with increased levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 and
p27Kip1. It is also consistent with the inhibition of RB
phosphorylation by lunasin-like peptides isolated from
Solanum nigrum [43].
It is well known that expression of cyclin D1,
considered a delayed early gene in G1, is induced by
mitogens, growth factors, and integrins and that several
key regulatory pathways are precisely orchestrated to
regulate the stimulatory/inhibitory signals controlling
cell cycle progression [44]. These pathways include the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway,
the protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) pathway, the NF-κB
pathway and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling.
Regulation of these pathways ultimately leads to cell
survival and proliferation. Lunasin has been shown to
suppress signaling through the FAK/ERK/NF-κB pathway
in colon cancer cells [31] and Akt/NF-κB signaling in
macrophages during activation of lipopolysaccharideinduced inflammation [29, 33]. These signaling effects
were proposed to be mediated by lunasin interactions with
α5β1 integrin in colon cancer cells and αvβ3 integrin in
macrophages, albeit, no functional studies were reported
to link these integrins to the observed signaling effects.
Lunasin may also exert it effects through regulation of
the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted in chromosome ten (PTEN). Lunasin-induced
apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells were shown to be
dependent on up-regulation and increased localization of
PTEN to the nucleus and was independent of p53 [42]. We
found that the ability of lunasin to inhibit NSCLC growth
in colony-forming assays was also independent of p53
function, confirming that p53 is unlikely to be involved
in modulating lunasin-induced effects. In addition to
effects on the aforementioned signaling pathways that are
potentially related to antagonism of integrin signaling, it
is likely that lunasin’s mechanism of action is multifold
and may involve alterations in histone acetylation [20, 30,
43]. It is possible that there is a direct linkage between
suppression of integrin signaling and histone acetylation
given the recent demonstration of Akt-dependent
regulation of histone acetylation in gliomas and prostate
cancer [45].
A key result obtained in these studies is that
lunasin inhibits the growth of NSCLC tumors in a mouse
xenograft model. The fact that the cell line used to initiate
the xenografts, H1299, was insensitive to lunasin in in
vitro assays using adherent cultures clearly suggest that
the microenvironment has a major effect on lunasin
sensitivity. In our studies, we observed a 63% inhibition
of NSCLC tumor growth at a dose of 30 mg/kg daily. This
comparable to results obtained in a breast cancer xenograft

DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated for the first time that lunasin
inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells both in vitro
and in vivo. With respect to in vitro growth, lunasin was
significantly more active under anchorage-independent
growth conditions which more closely mimic the in vivo
environment. This was particularly striking in the case of
H1299 cells, which were resistant to lunasin in adherent
culture but were sensitive in colony forming as well as
in vivo xenograft assays. This increased sensitivity in
anchorage-independent assays and in vivo may be due to
variations in the expression of cell surface receptors due
to alterations in the microenvironment under these growth
conditions. Given that lunasin contains a RGD domain, it
is possible that changes in integrin expression are involved
in the increased lunasin sensitivity. It is known that
integrin expression can change dramatically in different
microenvironments and that integrins are involved in the
pathophysiology of NSCLC [5]. Recent studies provide
evidence for the interaction of lunasin with some integrins
[29, 31]. Further investigations are needed to illuminate
the specificity and extent of lunasin-integrin interactions
in NSCLC cells.
Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the antiproliferative effect of lunasin on the NSCLC cell line
H661 in vitro is not due to apoptosis or necrosis, but
rather is caused by inhibition of cell cycle progression
at the G1/S phase. This is in contrast to other studies
that report that lunasin induces apoptosis in leukemia,
mammary and colon cells with IC50 values of 14, 62,
and 13 µM, respectively [5, 30-32, 42]. Lunasin was
reported to cause G2 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in
human L1210 leukemia cells [32] as well as in the colon
cancer cell lines HT-29 and KM12L4 grown in adherent
culture conditions [5, 31]. Hsieh et al. [30] reported that
synthetic lunasin inhibits the in vitro growth the breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with an IC50 of 181 µM
and that lunasin-treated cells were blocked at S-phase.
A later study demonstrated synthetic lunasin induced
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as well [42]. It is not particularly
surprising that different cell lines respond differently to
lunasin treatment given that a different complement of
mutations drives the cancer phenotype in each cell line. It
is also possible that differences in culture conditions or in
the lunasin preparations used contributed to the disparate
effects; we used a more highly purified lunasin preparation
than was used in some of the earlier studies [5, 31, 32]. We
found that lunasin’s anti-proliferative effect in H661 cells

of lunasin by IP for two months prior to the implantation
of MDA-MB-231 cells. Lunasin treated mice exhibited
both a decrease in tumor incidence and a reduction of
tumor size; 23% and 34% for the 20 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg
treatments, respectively [22]. A dose of 4 mg/kg lunasin
given IP has been shown reduce colon cancer metastasis
by 50% in spleen implantation mouse model [31]. Taken
together, these studies indicate that lunasin is a potential
therapeutic for the treatment of several deadly cancers that
warrants further study, particularly as an adjuvant therapy

Image Station 4000R Pro utilizing Carestream Molecular
Imaging Software v5.0.7.24 (Carestream). Densitometry
was performed using the ImageJ software v1.45.

H661 cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides at
20,000 cells/cm2/400 µL in growth medium and incubated
overnight at 37o C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
Cells were treated with 100 µM lunasin for 24 hours or
with 1 µM staurosporine for 4 to 6 hours. Determination
of apoptosis was ascertained using the Annexin V-Cy3™
Apoptosis Detection Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according
to provided instructions. Briefly, after the appropriate
incubation time, cells were washed with the provided
binding buffer and incubated in the double labeled
staining solution (1 µg/mL Annexin V-Cy3™ (AnnCy3),
500 µM 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (6-CFDA), 1X
binding buffer) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells
were then washed with binding buffer, stained with 1µg/
mL DAPI, washed again with binding buffer and coverslipped. Cells were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy
utilizing the Axio Observer.A1 inverted fluorescent
microscope and AxioVision v4.6.3.0 software (Zeiss
Microscopy).

In Vivo Tumor Growth
Male, 7 – 8 week old outbred homozygous nude
(Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu) mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were
subcutaneously injected in the right flank with 2 x 106
human H1299 cells. Two study groups comprising a
vehicle control and a lunasin treatment were established
(n = 10/group). The lunasin-treated group was subjected
to daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of lunasin at 30
mg/kg body weight starting upon initiation of the grafts.
Tumor size was measured every other day by vernier
caliper starting on day 18 through day 32. Tumor volume
was calculated using the equation volume = (width)2 x
(length)/2. Studies were carried out following established
guidelines by the University of Louisville Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol
#12091).

Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
H661 cells were plated at 6,000 cells/cm2 in 3 ml
per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 hours at
37o C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cultures were
synchronized by 72 hour serum deprivation, pretreated
with 100 µM lunasin for 4 hours and subsequently released
in medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence
of vehicle or lunasin. At 2 to 3 hour intervals, cultures
were pulsed with 10 µM 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) for 30 minutes, harvested by trypsinization, and
fixed for preparation for flow cytometry. Briefly, cells
were denatured (2N HCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton™ X-100),
neutralized (0.1 M sodium borate, pH8.5) and normalized
by cell counts using a hemocytometer. Cells were then
labeled with PE-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody, stained
with the nucleic acid dye 7-AAD and stored overnight at
4o C. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (10,000
events per sample) using the BD FACSAria™ and BD
FACSDiva Software v6.1.2, (BD Biosciences).

Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as the mean value ± SD of
at least three independent experiments. Significance
differences were determined using the Student’s t- test
with a probability factor p <0.05 being the criterion for
statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed
using SigmaPlot® v11.2 (Systat Software, Inc.).
