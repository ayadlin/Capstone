BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and bile acid and its farnesoid X receptor
(FXR) have been implicated in esophageal tumorigenesis. The authors investigated the role of FXR expression and activity in esophageal cancer initiation and growth. METHODS: FXR expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of FXR expression in esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice xenografts was suppressed by FXR
small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and guggulsterone (a natural FXR inhibitor). Esophageal cancer cells were treated with bile acids to demonstrate their effects on growth-promoting genes. RESULTS: FXR was expressed in 48 of 59 esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues
(81.3%), and this overexpression was associated with higher tumor grade, larger tumor size, and lymph node metastasis; however, was
inversely associated with retinoic acid receptor-b2 (RAR-b2) expression. Knockdown of FXR expression suppressed tumor cell growth
in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts. Guggulsterone reduced the viability of esophageal cancer cells in a time-dependent and dosedependent manner, whereas this effect was diminished after knockdown of FXR expression. Guggulsterone induced apoptosis
through activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 in tumor cells. FXR mediated bile acid-induced alterations of gene expression, eg, RAR-b2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of FXR by FXR shRNA or guggulsterone suppressed tumor cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro, and it reduced tumor formation and growth in nude mouse xenografts.

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer is a lethal disease with increasing incidence and high mortality in the world.1,2 Frequent gastroesophageal reflux carrying bile, hydrochloric acid, and proteases insults esophageal epithelial cells, leading to the formation of
premalignant Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.1-4 Bile acids normally are produced in liver cells by the
cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. The main function of bile acid is to facilitate the formation of
micelles for the processing and absorption of dietary fat.5-7 Bile acids, as surfactants or detergents, are potentially toxic to
the cells, so their concentrations in the small intestine are tightly regulated. However, patients with frequent gastroesophageal reflux will have damage caused by gastric acid and bile acid-containing juice in the distal esophagus, with the result
that normal squamous cells around the gastroesophageal junction will change to a new cell phenotype, incomplete intestinal metaplasia, which is more resistant to injury by acid and bile; this is how Barrett esophagus develops.8 Bile and gastric
acid reflux variably affect Barrett esophagus and may cause dysplasia or adenocarcinoma.3,4,8-10 Indeed, bile acids can activate the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway and induce expression of activating factor-1 (AP-1), cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), and other genes, such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-jB),10-15 that
play antiapoptotic roles in cells and, in turn, increase cell proliferation and/or promote the invasiveness potential of Barrett
metaplasia and neoplasia. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined how bile acids induce malignant phenotypes and
altered gene expression in esophageal cells. Previous studies demonstrated that bile acid farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear hormone receptor, is overexpressed in Barrett esophagus tissues and may mediates carcinogenic effects of bile acids in
esophageal tumorigeneiss.5,6,16 Furthermore, the expression of nuclear retinoic acid receptor-b2 (RAR-b2) was reportedly
reduced in different human cancers, including esophageal cancer. The induction of RAR-b2 expression in esophageal cancer cells suppressed tumor cell growth and colony formation and induced apoptosis.7,15 In contrast, esophageal, lung, and
breast cancer cell lines that do not express RAR-b2 were resistant to retinoid treatment.5,17,18 Our previous studies also
linked RAR-b2 expression with the down-regulation of COX-2 expression in vitro and ex vivo.15,19,20 However, both

FXR and RAR-b2 need to bind to retinoid X receptors
(RXRs) for their functioning,13,14,21 and bile acidreduced RAR-b2 may be mediated by FXR-RXR heterodimerization to compete with RXR–RAR-b2 binding
(RXR–RAR-b2 heterodimer is needed to induce RAR-b2
expression, a positive feedback mechanism21). Thus, in
the current study, we hypothesized that carcinogenic
effects of bile acid could be through the FXR-mediated
down-regulation of RAR-b2 expression, whereas inhibition of FXR expression or activity will effectively control
esophageal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Specimens and Immunohistochemistry

Our institutional review board approved our protocol for
the use of patient samples in this study, and all patients
agreed to participate. This study included paraffin block
samples from 59 consecutive patients with esophageal
adenocarcinoma who had undergone esophagectomy
without preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy
between the years 1986 and 1997 at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
The immunohistochemical analysis followed our
previously described methodology.19,22,23 The anti-FXR
antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, Calif) and was applied at 1:50 dilution.
The sections were reviewed and scored under a microscope as positively or negatively stained (10% tumor
cells with positive nuclear staining counted as positive
staining).
Cell Culture and Drug Treatment

The esophageal squamous cell cancer cell lines TE-3 and
TE-12 and the adenocarcinoma cell lines SKGT-4 and
SKGT-5 were used in our previous studies20,24 and were
grown in Dulbecco modified essential medium with 10%
fetal bovine serum at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of
95% air and 5% CO2. For bile acid or guggulsterone
treatment, the cells were plated for 24 hours in regular
medium and then replaced either with control medium
(containing the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide) or
with medium containing a bile acid (chenodeoxycholic
acid, deoxycholic acid, or lithocholic acid) or guggulsterone (all from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo;
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before use) for quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR), Western blot, and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium
assays. After the addition of bile acid, the pH of the
growth medium was adjusted to between 7.2 and 7.4.

Construction of Farnesoid X Receptor Small
Hairpin RNA and Gene Transfection

FXR shRNA plasmids were purchased from OriGene
Technologies (Rockville, Md). The plasmids were amplified and their sequences confirmed before use. The pRFPCRS vector contains hairpin loop sequences and, when
used as a negative control, is identical to the scrambled
shRNA control used by some other companies. pRFPCRS vector containing 1 of 4 different FXR shRNA constructs or control shRNA was transfected into SKGT-4
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif), and the cells were treated with 0.25 lg/mL puromycin for 48 hours. Sixteen hours before cells were harvested, 200 lM of chenodeoxycholic acid were added to
the culture medium and subjected to qRT-PCR and
Western blot analysis.
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain
Reaction and Quantitative Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction

RNA from the cells was extracted and subjected to
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR as described previously.20,23 Glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a
loading control. The primers for FXR expression were
50 -GGAAATGCAAAGAGATGGGA-30 and 50 -AGACC
CTTTCAGCAAAGCAA-30 , which generated a 416-base
pair (bp) band. The primers for COX-2 expression were 50 CCTTCTGCCTGACACCTTTC-30 and 50 -GGTCAAT
GGAAGCCTGTGAT-30 , which generated a 194-bp
band. The primers for MMP-9 expression were 50 -GCAC
GACGTCTTCCAGTACC-30 and 50 -GTTTGTATCCG
GCAAACTGG-30 , which generated a 224-bp band. The
primers for RAR-b2 expression were 50 -CAAACCGA
ATGGCAGCATCGG-30 and 50 -GCGGAAAAAGCC
CTTACATCCC-30 , which amplified a 195-bp band.
GAPDH primers were 50 -CCCTTCATTGACCTCAA
CTACATGG-30 and 50 -CATGGTGGTGAAGACGCC
AG-30 , which generated 192-bp band.
Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis

Total cellular protein was isolated as described elsewhere.20,24 Samples containing 50 lg of protein from
control or treated cells were separated by 10% to 14% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and then transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-C
nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Arlington
Heights, Ill) for Western blot analysis.20,24 The antibodies
used were anti-RAR-b and anti-FXR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-COX-2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Ky); anticaspase-3, anticaspase-8, and
anti caspase-9 and antiactivated caspase-3, caspase-8, and

Farnesoid X Receptor Small Hairpin RNA
Transfection and Immunocytochemical Staining
of Ki-67 Protein

Esophageal cancer SKGT-4 and TE-12 cells were grown
and transiently transfected with pCMS/EGFP (BD Clontech, San Diego, Calif) plus either control shRNA (OriGene) or FXR shRNA (OriGene) using Lipofectamine
2000; and, 36 hours later, the cells were treated with 0.25
lg/mL puromycin for an additional 24 hours. The cells
were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10
minutes at room temperature for immunostaining of the
proliferation marker Ki-67 as described elsewhere.19,22
Ki-67 antibody was purchased from Vector Laboratories
(Burlingame, Calif) and diluted to 1:50.
DNA Fragmentation Assay

The cells were treated with or without 25 lM guggulsterone for 3 days, and soluble DNA was extracted from both
floating and attached cells and then subjected to DNA
fragmentation assay as described previously.7
Nude Mouse Xenograft Assay

The animal experiments were performed in accordance
with an institution-approved animal care and use protocol. Each nu/nu nude mouse (aged 6 weeks) was injected
subcutaneously into the right flank through a 22-gauge
needle with 2  106 stable control shRNA-transfected or
FXR shRNA-transfected SKGT-4 cells in a total volume
of 200 lL per mouse. Other mice received guggulsterone
(50 mg/kg daily) orally for 2 days and then were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank through a 22-gauge
needle with 3  106 SKGT-4 cells in a total volume of
200 lL per mouse, and these continued to receive guggulsterone (50 mg/kg) daily for an additional 20 days. Both
groups of animals were monitored daily for tumor formation and growth. At the end of the experiment, the mice
were killed, and tumor xenografts were removed, fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde, weighed, and photographed.

pCH110, a b-galactosidase expression vector (GE Healthcare), was used as an internal control for assessing transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours later, the cells were
treated with or without 200 lM of chenodeoxycholic acid
for an additional 24 hours and were harvested for analysis
of b-galactosidase and luciferase activities. A Turner
Designs luminometer (model TD-20/20; Promega, Madison, Wis) recorded the luciferase activity in relative light
units that were normalized to b-galactosidase activity to
correct for differences in transfection efficiency.20 All
experiments were performed in triplicate and were
repeated at least twice to confirm the reproducibility of
the results.
Statistical Analysis

The effects of guggulsterone on tumor cell viability were
summarized from 3 independent experiments. Results
between groups were compared using the Student t test.
Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean.
The association of FXR with RAR-b2 expression in esophageal cancer tissues was analyzed using the McNemar test
with the statistical software package SPSS (version 11.5;
SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). P values < .05 were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Overexpression of Farnesoid X Receptor
Protein in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Tissues

The expression of FXR protein was revealed by immunohistochemical staining in normal and cancerous
esophageal tissue specimens, and FXR was highly
expressed in the nuclei of 48 of 59 esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues examined (81.3%). In contrast, none of
20 normal esophageal squamous epithelial specimens
expressed FXR protein (0%; 0 of 20 specimens)
(Fig. 1a). FXR expression was associated with higher tumor grade, larger tumor size, and lymph node metastasis (Table 1). The expression of FXR protein was
inversely associated with RAR-b2 expression (P ¼
.0001) (Table 2, Fig. 1a).

(a) Tissue samples from 59 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma were immunostained for FXR and were hybridized
in situ for retinoic acid receptor-b2 (RAR-b2) expression. The

and observed that 2 constructs reduced FXR expression
(Fig. 2a). Then, we transiently transfected an FXR shRNA
vector into esophageal cancer cells, stained the cells for Ki67 expression, and observed that Ki-67 expression was significantly lower in cells transfected with the FXR shRNA
constructs than in those transfected with control shRNA
(Fig. 2b). Moreover, stable control shRNA-transfected or
FXR shRNA-transfected SKGT-4 cells revealed that FXR
knockdown significantly reduced tumor cell growth compared with controls (Fig. 2c).

guggulsterone reduced tumor cell viability in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2e,f). However, this effect of guggulsterone was diminished after
knockdown of FXR expression (Fig. 2d), indicating that
the effects of guggulsterone were mediated through FXR
inhibition. Guggulsterone treatment inhibited expression
of the RAR-b2-led COX-2 and MMP-9 pathway genes
(Fig. 3a) and induced apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related genes in esophageal cancer cells (Fig. 3b,c).

Farnesoid X Receptor Mediates Alteration of
Gene Expression by Bile Acids

To better understand the role of FXR in the tumor-promoting effects of bile acids in esophageal cancer, we
explored the effects of different bile acids on the regulation of FXR, RAR-b2, and COX-2 expression in esophageal cancer cell lines. We observed that the cells treated
with a bile acid (chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid,
or lithocholic acid at a concentration of 200 lM) for 48
hours had a decreased expression of RAR-b2 mRNA but
induced expression of COX-2 and FXR mRNAs (Fig. 5a).
Chenodeoxycholic acid, a potent FXR ligand, inhibited
RAR-b2 protein expression but induced FXR and COX-2
protein expression (Fig. 5b,c).
Furthermore, the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid
on RAR-b2 and COX-2 expression were significantly
antagonized in cells that were transiently transfected with
FXR shRNA (Fig. 5d,e). Chenodeoxycholic acid acts at
the transcriptional level through FXR to suppress RAR-b2
expression, because knockdown of FXR expression abolished the suppressive effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on
RAR-b2 promoter activity (Fig. 5f). Together, these data
indicate that FXR mediated the effects of bile acids in
esophageal cancer cell lines (ie, inhibition of RAR-b2 and
induction of COX-2 expression).
DISCUSSION
FXR is activated by bile acids that function as signaling
molecules in the liver and intestines to regulate bile acid
and lipid metabolism.5,6,16,25 FXR also plays roles in
growth regulation, apoptosis, and cancer development.2630
Several recent publications have reported that FXR protects liver cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in vitro and fasting in vivo.26 It also was
demonstrated that FXR protects against intestinal tumorigenesis.27 However, the expression and functions of FXR
in organs other than the liver-intestine system portray a
different picture. For example, an Oncomine database
search identified more than 30 combinational DNA

(cDNA) microarray studies demonstrating that FXR
expression was associated with breast and esophageal cancer development, higher tumor grade, metastasis, and
patient survival (available at: www.oncomine.com;
[accessed July 2011]). FXR expression was correlated
significantly with the proliferation marker Ki-67 and with
positive lymph node status in postmenopausal women
who had estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer; and in
vitro experiments demonstrated that bile acids stimulated
the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive cells in steroid-free medium.29 The FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic
acid significantly increased endothelial cell motility and
tube formation, and the increased cell motility was associated with prominent increases in focal adhesion that were
inhibited by FXR or MMP-9 small interfering RNA
(siRNA).31 In esophageal cancer, FXR expression was
higher in esophagitis and Barrett esophagus than in normal mucosa.30 In vitro treatment with guggulsterone was
associated with a significant increase in apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in Barrett esophagus-derived cells.32 Bile
acid-stimulated expression of FXR reportedly enhanced
the immune response in Barrett esophagus.32 Furthermore, FXR was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and
was associated with lymph node metastasis in ex vivo and
FXR expression-promoted tumor cell migration and
invasion.33 These data indicate that FXR plays a role in

promoting the development or progression of different
human cancers.
In this study, we demonstrated that guggulsterone
induced the expression of RAR-b2 but reduced the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9, effects similar to those of
FXR shRNA, in esophageal cancer cells. Guggulsterone,
an ingredient in many nutritional supplements, acts in
humans as a natural antagonist of FXR.34,35 It suppresses
activation of the inflammatory transcription factor NFjB, which is induced by various carcinogens and tumor
promoters, including bile acids.34,35 It has been demonstrated that guggulsterone inhibits the proliferation of a
wide variety of tumor cells and induces them to undergo
apoptosis. It also has been demonstrated that guggulsterone inhibits angiogenesis by blocking signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in colon cancer cells.36 Most important, guggulsterone is also a partial
FXR agonist. Previous studies demonstrated that guggulsterone exerted antagonistic effects on FXR-induced
recruitment of the v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2)
viral oncogene homolog (Src-1) and other genes, but it
also induced expression of the bile salt export pump
(BSEP) transporter, a known FXR-regulated gene.37,38
Furthermore, several studies demonstrated that guggulsterone has a suppressive effect on xenograft formation
and growth of different cancers in vivo.37,38 However,
although the in vivo effect of guggulsterone was not statistically significant in the current study, future study will
allow us to better define the experimental conditions,
such as the dose and bioavailability of guggulsterone and
the number of tumor cells injected.
In previous studies, gastric acid and bile acid reportedly induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
activity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPAR-c) expression, and cell proliferation in
normal esophageal epithelial cells.12 Bile acid exposure
causes phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase–mediated proliferation of Barrett adenocarcinoma cells,39 and deoxycholic
acid at neutral pH activates NF-jB and induces interleukin-8 expression in esophageal cells in vitro.40 Our study
demonstrated that inhibition of bile acid-induced COX-2
expression by retinoic acid depended on RAR-b2 expression.15 Together, the results from those studies suggest
that bile acids have carcinogenic effects in gastrointestinal
cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Our current study demonstrates that FXR mediates
the effects of bile acids on gene expression in esophageal
cancer cells and that inhibition of FXR not only
suppresses tumor cell viability through the induction of

grown and treated with 200 lM chenodeoxycholic acid (CD), deoxycholic acid (DC), lithocholic acid (LA), or control (Con) for
48 hours. GAPDH indicates glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase; RAR-b2; retinoic acid receptor-b2; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2. (b)
SKGT-4 and TE-12 cells were grown and treated with different doses of chenodeoxycholic acid (all doses are in lM) for qRT-PCR.
(c) For Western blot analysis, cells were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid or with control (C) for 12 hours or 24 hours. NS indicates nonspecific. (d) For semiquantitative RT-PCR, SKGT-4 and TE-12 cells were grown and transiently transfected with FXR
small hairpin RNA-3 (shRNA) and were treated with 200 lM CD for 24 hours. siRNA indicates short interfering RNA. (e) Cells
that were treated as described in d were subjected to Western blot analysis. (f) For a Luciferase assay, SKGT-4 and TE-12 cells
were grown and transiently transfected with an RAR-b2 gene promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector (RARb) with or without
FXR shRNA vector or empty vector. pCH110, a b-galactosidase expression vector, was used as an internal control for assessing
transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells either were treated with CD or were left untreated for an additional 24 hours. The cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. The data indicate that luciferase activity was
high after RAR-b2 promoter transfection, whereas CD treatment suppressed RAR-b2 luciferase activity. However, after cotransfection with FXR shRNA, RAR-b2 luciferase activity was rescued significantly in SKGT-4 cells compared with CD-treated cells but
was only faintly rescued in TE-12 cells (FXR expression in TE-12 cells was very low compared with that in SKGT-4 cells). C indicates negative control.

apoptosis in vitro but also reduces the formation and
growth of nude mouse xenograft tumors. These data, together with published data,10,28-31 indicate that targeting
of FXR could be evaluated further as a novel strategy in
the prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
