Abstract
Tumor-derived exosomes containing the tetraspanin Tspan8 can efficiently induce angiogenesis in tumors
and tumor-free tissues. However, little information exists on exosome–endothelial cell (EC) interactions or the
proangiogenic role of tetraspanins, which are a constitutive component of exosomes. In this study, we used a
rat adenocarcinoma model (AS-Tspan8) to explore the effects of exosomal Tspan8 on angiogenesis. Tspan8
contributed to a selective recruitment of proteins and mRNA into exosomes, including CD106 and CD49d,
which were implicated in exosome-EC binding and EC internalization. We found that EC internalized
Tspan8-CD49d complex–containing exosomes. Exosome uptake induced vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)–independent regulation of several angiogenesis-related genes, including von Willebrand factor, Tspan8,
chemokines CXCL5 and MIF, chemokine receptor CCR1, and, together with VEGF, VEGF receptor 2. EC uptake
of Tspan8-CD49d complex–containing exosomes was accompanied by enhanced EC proliferation, migration,
sprouting, and maturation of EC progenitors. Unraveling these new pathways of exosome-initiated EC regulation could provide new options for therapeutic interference with tumor-induced angiogenesis. Cancer Res; 70(4);

Introduction
Rapidly growing solid tumors depend on angiogenesis,
initiated by dominance of proangiogenic factors (1, 2). We
recently identified the tetraspanin Tspan8 (formerly D6.1A/
CO-029) as an important angiogenesis inducer within the tumor and tumor-free tissue, which can culminate in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; refs. 3, 4). The cross
talk between a tumor and its environment has been intensively explored (5). Systemic tumor-induced alterations, like
the thrombotic state, are poorly understood (6) but suggested to require soluble mediators (7). Recently, exosomes

have come into focus as potent intercellular communicators
(8, 9). Tetraspanins being enriched in exosomes (10, 11), we
hypothesized that tumor-derived Tspan8 exosomes contribute to systemic angiogenesis.
Exosomes, 50- to 100-nm vesicles, derived from endosomes
forming multivesicular bodies, are abundantly released by
tumor cells (8, 12, 13). Primary sources of endosomes are caveolae, clathrin-coated pits, and tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM; ref. 13). These types of membrane microdomains
are also recovered in exosomes (8, 14, 15). Additionally, exosomes contain selectively enriched mRNA and miRNA that
regulate gene expression in target cells (16). Indeed, the source
of exosomes defines their function. Antigen-presenting cell–
derived exosomes induce and tumor-derived exosomes suppress an immune response (17).
The recovery of membrane microdomains in exosomes is
of particular interest with respect to tetraspanins, which organize clusters of tetraspanins, additional transmembrane
proteins, and membrane-proximal signaling proteins, such
as integrins, G protein–coupled receptors, proteases, and
protein kinase C (10, 18–20). Prominent Tspan8 partners
are CD13, EWI-F, intersectin-2, EpCAM, CD49c, and CD104
(21). Within TEM, tetraspanins act as “molecular facilitators”
(10, 18), getting involved in cell motility, adhesion (10, 20–23),
scaffolding of signal transduction molecules (10, 18, 21), vesicle, and cell fusion (10, 18, 24). Based on these features, tetraspanins might well become involved in exosome-recipient
cell binding, which proceeds via receptor-ligand interaction,
fusion, or internalization (8, 13, 17, 25). The restriction of the
exosome-target cell interaction (13, 16) relies on the exosomal proteins and target cell ligands (21).

Exosome-Induced Endothelial Cell Activation

Tumor-derived exosomes are present in body fluids (26)
and likely are involved in systemic angiogenesis, which can
culminate in severe thrombosis (27). Therefore, a blockade
of angiogenesis-initiating exosomes may hinder tumor vascularization and thrombosis, sparing physiologic, angiogenic
factor–initiated angiogenesis. As a precondition for therapeutic interference, we started to evaluate components and
activity of angiogenesis-initiating AS-Tspan8 exosomes (4).
We show that a Tspan8-CD49d association contributes to
exosome binding to endothelial cell (EC) and identified potential pathways, whereby internalized exosomes can modulate the fate of EC and EC progenitors (ECP).

Materials and Methods
Rats, tumors, and primary cells. BDX rats were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions (animal facilities, German Cancer Research Center). BSp73AS (AS; BDX-derived
pancreatic adenocarcinoma) cells (28), AS-Tspan8 clones
(4), lung fibroblasts (LuFb), and rat aortic ECs (RAEC; CellLining) were maintained in RPMI 1640/10% FCS. Primary
aortic ring (AoR; 1-mm-thick slices)–derived EC and ECP
were cultured in MCDB131 or RPMI 1640/2% FCS, 2 mmol/
L glutamine, 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone, and 5 units/mL heparin with or without 0.1% EC supplement (Sigma). ECs were
enriched using biotinylated lectin (Sigma) and streptavidinconjugated dynabeads (Invitrogen). Purity was controlled by
anti-CD31 staining.
Antibodies. Primary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Hybridoma-derived antibodies were FITC
or rhodamine labeled. Biotinylated, horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)–conjugated, and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary
antibodies were obtained commercially (BD Pharmingen,
Dianova, and Biotrend).
RNA and reverse transcription-PCR. Exosomal and cellular mRNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).
Transcription and amplification followed routine procedure.
Amplified gene products were semiquantitatively evaluated
(ImageJ freeware). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR
PCR kit (Qiagen), StepOne Real-Time PCR System, and statistical analysis by the ΔCt method according to the supplier's
recommendation (Applied Biosystems). Primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.
Microarray mRNA analysis. Expression levels of 22,523
rat transcripts were analyzed using Illumina RatRef-12 chip
in duplicates. Analyses, normalization, and statistics were
performed at the Core Facility, German Cancer Research
Center. Cellular and exosomal samples were normalized independently. Transcripts with at least double signal intensity
over background, bead SE differences of >12, and P value of
<0.05 were included. mRNAs that differed in AS versus ASTspan8 exosomes by >3-fold and in AS exosome–treated ver-

sus AS-Tspan8 exosome–treated RAEC by >1.5-fold were considered as differentially expressed. The microarray analysis
series record is GSE18812.5
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry (1 × 105 to 3 × 105 cells
per sample) followed routine procedures. Trypsinized cells
were allowed to recover (2 h, 37°C, RPMI 1640/10% FCS).
Samples were analyzed by a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence. Cells on coverslips were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, incubated with primary antibodies
(2–10 μg/mL, 60 min, 4°C) and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (60 min, 4°C), blocked, incubated with
second dye-labeled antibodies (60 min, 4°C) and washed.
Coverslips were mounted in Elvanol. Digitized images (Carl
Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope) were generated. For topology analysis, 12 Z-stack images were taken in 1-μm steps.
Focus plane was adjusted visually and three-dimensional
projection was generated. For all applications, AxioVision
Software Rel. 4.7 was used.
Exosome preparation. Cells were cultured (36 h) in serum-free medium. Cleared supernatants (2 × 10 min, 500 ×
g; 1 × 20 min, 2,000 × g; 1 × 30 min, 10,000 × g) were centrifuged (90 min, 100,000 × g) and washed (PBS, 90 min, 100,000
× g). Crude exosome preparations were suspended in 2.5
mol/L sucrose, overlaid by a continuous sucrose gradient
(0.25–2 mol/L), and centrifuged (15 h, 150,000 × g). Where
indicated, exosomes were prepared after cell biotinylation
(45 min, 4°C) or rhodamine-DHPE labeling (60 min, 4°C). Relative fluorescence intensity was evaluated at 540-nm excitation and 590-nm emission and adjusted to rhodamine-DHPE
standards.
Proteome analysis. Exosomal proteins (700 μg/analysis/
duplicate) were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis or prehydrated plastic sheet gel strips for separation of
hydrophobic proteins (29) followed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization–time-of-flight analysis. Densitometric
analyses were done with the PDQuest software after Flamingo staining (Bio-Rad).
Biotinylation, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot.
Cells were washed in HEPES buffer and, where required,
incubated with 0.1 mg/mL water-soluble sulfo-NHS-biotin
(30 min, 4°C). Cells were lysed (HEPES buffer, 1% Lubrol,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor
mix) for 30 min at 4°C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates
were incubated with the indicated antibody (2 h) and protein
G–Sepharose (1 h). After washing (four times), lysates/immunoprecipitates were resolved on 12% nonreducing SDS-PAGE
and subjected to immunoblotting using HRP-conjugated antibody/streptavidin following enhanced chemiluminescence–
based signal detection.
Migration assays. Subconfluent monolayers were
scratched (wound) and evaluated after 24 to 72 h by light microscopy. For Transwell migration (Boyden chambers, 8-μm
pore size membranes), cells were added to the upper (1 ×
10 6 /mL, RPMI 1640/0.1% FCS) and to the lower [RPMI
1640/10% FCS, 10 μg/mL exosomes or 5 ng/mL vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] chamber. After 12 h, cells
on the lower membrane side were fixed and crystal violet
stained (595-nm absorbance).

Matrigel assay. Freshly cut AoR and AoR-EC were embedded in Matrigel (24-well plates) and covered with RPMI 1640/
2% FCS, 5 ng/mL VEGF, or 10 μg/mL exosomes. Cable formation was evaluated after 12 d (AoR) or 1 d (AoR-EC) by light
microscopy.
Proliferation assay. ECs were incubated for 24 to 96 h in
RPMI 1640/2% FCS, 5 ng/mL VEGF, or 10 μg/mL exosomes.
[3H]Thymidine was added during the last 16 h. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in a β-counter.
Statistics. According to request, assays (three repetitions,
regardless of intra-assay triplicates) were statistically evaluated by the two-tailed Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test,
or Mann-Whitney test. P values of <0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
AS-Tspan8 cells induce angiogenesis (3, 4). AS-Tspan8
exosomes, but neither AS exosomes nor exosome-depleted
AS-Tspan8 supernatant, induce EC sprouting (4). A

Tspan8-expressing metastatic subline does not induce angiogenesis (28), indicating that exosomal Tspan8 is required
but not sufficient for angiogenesis induction. Thus, the
questions arose on the particular features allowing ASTspan8 exosomes, which do not contain VEGF, to initiate
EC activation.
AS-Tspan8 exosome characterization. Crude exosome
preparations of both AS and AS-Tspan8 cells contained 30
to 50 μg protein/100 mL supernatant, suggesting that ASTspan8–initiated angiogenesis unlikely is due to abundance
of AS-Tspan8 exosomes compared with AS exosomes. To
avoid impurities, revealed by electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S1), we performed sucrose density gradient centrifugation, resulting in a yield of 4 to 8 μg protein/100 mL
supernatant. Western blot analysis showed enrichment of
tetraspanins and the exosome markers CD71, heat shock
protein (HSP) 70, and Lamp1 in the 1.141- to 1.171-day fractions. Tetraspanin nonassociated Bag6 served as a control
(Fig. 1A).
To obtain information toward the content of AS-Tspan8
exosomes compared with AS exosomes, we proceeded with

AS and AS-Tspan8 exosomes contained ∼1,500 transcripts;
285 were enriched by >3-fold in AS-Tspan8 exosomes (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 1B). Being particularly interested in
transcription factors, vesicle transporters, and signaling molecules, enhanced expression of the transcription factors
MycN, Spi-C, elongation factor B(SIII), TCEB-1, fibroblast
growth factor binding protein 1 (FGFBP1), and growth and differentiation factor-3 (GDF3) was verified in AS-Tspan8 exosomes compared with AS exosomes and the parental cells
by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). VEGF mRNA was
not enriched in AS-Tspan8 cells or exosomes (Fig. 1C).
CCL20, prothrombin, bone morphogenetic protein-2, several
Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase family members,
and a phosphatase 2A subunit were below the detection level
(data not shown).

Tetraspanins act by modulating the activities of associated
proteins, major partners being integrins. Exosomes deriving
from internalized membrane domains, we first evaluated tetraspanin and integrin colocalization at the cell membrane
and after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)–induced
internalization. CD49c colocalization with CD9 and Tspan8
remained unaltered after internalization. In contrast,
CD49d weakly colocalized with CD9 and Tspan8 at the cell
membrane but only with Tspan8 after internalization
(Fig. 2A). In cell lysates, Tspan8 coimmunoprecipitated with
CD9, CD151, and CD49c. CD49c also coimmunoprecipitated
with CD9 (Fig. 2B). Coimmunoprecipitation differed in exosomes. CD49c, CD49b, and CD61 were recovered in AS and
AS-Tspan8 exosomes. CD49d and CD49e were only present in
AS-Tspan8 exosomes, suggesting their selective recruitment.
CD49c and CD61 coimmunoprecipitated with CD9 in AS and
AS-Tspan8 exosome lysates. CD49e coimmunoprecipitated
with CD9. Instead, CD49d coimmunoprecipitated with CD9,
CD151, and Tspan8 only in AS-Tspan8 exosome lysates,

which suggests a rearrangement of the Tspan8 web during
internalization (Fig. 2C).
A comparative proteome analysis revealed, besides the distinctly recruited CD49d, high recovery of minichromosome
maintenance protein 7 (MCM7), laminin receptor 1 (lamininR1), Mac2BP (galactoside binding protein-3), CD106/
VCAM-1, HSP70, and the major VAULT protein in AS-Tspan8
exosomes (Supplementary Table S4). CD106, HSP70, and
Mac2BP enrichment was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2D).
These results show that Tspan8 overexpression in AS cells
has a major effect on the recruitment of selected proteins
and mRNA into exosomes. We next elaborated whether exosomal Tspan8 contributes to EC targeting.

AS-Tspan8 exosome binding to and uptake by EC. Immunofluorescence of RAEC incubated with dye-labeled ASTspan8 exosomes showed a higher binding rate of AS-Tspan8
than AS exosomes, and a three-dimensional analysis indicated internalization of the dye-labeled exosomes. D6.1 (anti-rat
Tspan8), anti-CD49d, and anti-CD106 inhibited AS-Tspan8
exosome binding to RAEC but not to LuFb. Low binding of
AS exosomes by RAEC was not inhibited. Instead, anti-CD151
and anti-CD49c inhibited both AS and AS-Tspan8 exosome
binding by LuFb; anti-CD9 inhibited AS exosome binding
(Fig. 3A and B).
To further evaluate exosome incorporation, biotinylated
AS/AS-Tspan8 exosomes were cocultured with AoR-EC or

exosome preincubation with antibody (20 μg/mL): confocal microscopy (fluorescence, light field, overlay). After washing and lysis, exosome uptake was
measured in an ELISA reader. D6.1, anti-CD49d, and anti-CD106 inhibited AS-Tspan8 exosome uptake by RAEC. Anti-CD151, anti-CD49c, and anti-CD9
inhibited AS and AS-Tspan8 exosome uptake by LuFb. C, RAEC and LuFb were incubated with biotinylated exosomes. Lysates of washed cells were
separated (SDS-PAGE), transferred, and blotted with streptavidin-HRP. Biotinylated protein profiles were similar in LuFb incubated with AS and AS-Tspan8
exosomes. Instead, higher amounts of biotinylated proteins were recovered in RAEC incubated with AS-Tspan8 exosomes. Titrated amounts of
DHPE-labeled AS-Tspan8 exosomes were incubated (15 min, 37°C or 30 min, 4°C) with RAEC or LuFb. Only in RAEC, AS-Tspan8 exosome uptake

Exosome-Induced Endothelial Cell Activation

Figure 4. AS-Tspan8 exosome–promoted EC proliferation and migration. A, RAEC and LuFb were cocultured with VEGF, AS exosomes, or AS-Tspan8
exosomes (10 μg/mL). Proliferative activity (triplicates, mean ± SD) was evaluated by [3H]thymidine uptake after 24 to 96 h. B, microscopic appearance

coculture with AS-Tspan8 exosomes. C, RAEC and LuFb monolayers were scratched; medium was exchanged as indicated; wound healing was evaluated
after 48 h. Black dotted line, scratch; white dotted line, healing (scale bar: 500 μm); mean ± SD (10 fields, three independent cultures) of migrated cells.
Cells (RPMI 1640/0.1% FCS) were seeded in the upper chamber of Transwell plates. The lower chamber contained RPMI 1640/10% FCS (control) and the
indicated supplements. Absorbance (595 nm) of crystal violet–stained cells was measured after 24 h. The percentage of migrating cells (triplicates,
mean ± SD) is shown. AS-Tspan8 exosomes accelerated RAEC but not LuFb migration. D, Matrigel-embedded AoR outgrowths were cocultured with
exosomes or VEGF: cable-like structures (scale bar: 1mm) and mean ± SD cable length (10 fields) after 12 d. VEGF and AS-Tspan8 exosomes support
cable-like growth and branching. *, significant differences between AS and AS-Tspan8 exosomes.

LuFb. Cells were lysed, and proteins were separated by SDSPAGE, transferred, and stained with streptavidin-HRP. LuFb
and AoR-EC incorporated exosome-derived biotin. Whereas
identical biotinylated protein patterns were recovered in
LuFb, AoR-EC preferentially incorporated AS-Tspan8 exosomes. Adding dye-labeled AS-Tspan8 exosomes to RAEC
and LuFb, fluorescent dye recovery in RAEC linearly increased with the amount of exosomes. Low dye recovery in
LuFb indicated modest uptake (Fig. 3C).
EC also incorporated exosomal mRNA. Spi-C, GDF3, and
FGFBP1 mRNA, enriched in AS-Tspan8 exosomes, were
transferred into RAEC but not, or weakly, into LuFb. Genes
were recovered after 10 minutes to 1 hour of coincubation,
but not after 12 hours, suggesting a short lifetime of transferred mRNA. Notably, these mRNAs were below detection

level in AS-Tspan8 cells, confirming selective enrichment in
AS-Tspan8 exosomes (Fig. 3D).
These findings provide evidence for pronounced ASTspan8 exosome binding and uptake by EC, which involves
Tspan8 and CD49d and may be strengthened by CD106.
Tspan8 exosomes initiate activation of resting EC and
maturation of ECP. When purified exosomes were cultured
with RAEC and LuFb, AS-Tspan8 exosomes and VEGF induced stronger RAEC proliferation than AS exosomes. AS
exosomes supported LuFb proliferation (Fig. 4A). AS-Tspan8
exosomes sufficed to activate resting EC from quiescent AoR
as efficiently as VEGF. Dio-Ac-LDL uptake revealed that the
percentage of outgrowing EC was particularly increased. AS
exosomes induced a minor increase in EC compared with
untreated controls (Fig. 4B).

AS-Tspan8 exosomes also supported pronounced migration of RAEC in wound healing and Transwell migration
(Fig. 4C). When embedded in Matrigel, AoR outgrowth
formed a larger network and AoR-EC showed stronger
branching in cocultures with VEGF and AS-Tspan8 than AS
exosomes (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S3B). To control for
Tspan8 exosome selectivity, AoR-EC migration and sprouting
on Matrigel was evaluated with exosomes from additional rat
tumor cell lines, AT6.1, AT6.1-Tspan8, BDX2, and MatLyLu.
Except MatLyLu, the lines express CD49d, but only AT6.1Tspan8 and BDX2 express Tspan8 (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Only exosomes derived from Tspan8-expressing cells
accelerated migration and cable formation (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and B), confirming a role of Tspan8 in exosomeinitiated EC activation.
Proliferation and migration of EC cocultured with ASTspan8 exosomes was accompanied by regulation of gene expression. A genome-wide mRNA screening revealed several
genes in EC, triggered selectively by AS-Tspan8 exosomes
(Supplementary Table S5). Validation via RT-PCR confirmed
strong CXCL5, CCR1, MIF, and DEC1 (deleted in esophageal

cancer) induction in RAEC by AS-Tspan8 exosomes; HMOX1
(hemoxygenase 1), VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), von Willebrand
factor (vWF), and tissue factor (TF) expression was induced by
AS-Tspan8 exosomes and VEGF. CXCL5, TF, and HMOX1 expression was also regulated in LuFb (Fig. 5A). Elevated
mRNA levels remained stable or increased during 120 hours
of coculture (data not shown). Transcription of Tspan8 was
observed after 48 hours and increased until 72 to 120 hours
of coculture. A synergistic effect of VEGF and AS-Tspan8
exosomes was observed on VEGFR2 expression. Confirming
the AS-Tspan8 exosome specificity, transcription of other
genes, such as smooth muscle actin (SMA), was not affected
(Fig. 5B).
Early ECPs are defined by clonal expansion and the potential to differentiate into ECs and smooth muscle cells (SMC;
Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 30). When cocultured with VEGF,
only few AoR outgrowths survived for more than five passages. These cells showed the appearance of EC confirmed
by Dio-Ac-LDL uptake. Instead, in the presence of low
amounts (0.1 μg/mL) of AS-Tspan8 exosomes, a population
of clustered, densely packed, small round cells became visible

Exosome-Induced Endothelial Cell Activation

5th and 15th passages of AoR outgrowth cocultured with VEGF or AS-Tspan8 exosomes (0.1 μg/mL). Only AS-Tspan8 exosome–containing cultures
developed clusters of round, densely packed cells that partly took up Dio-Ac-LDL and showed the expression profile (flow cytometry, fifth passage) of ECP.
Cells were maintained with unaltered morphology for >3 mo. B, gene expression after 11 passages in comparison with AoR-EC. Left, quantitative PCR;

PDGF: morphology (scale bar: 200 μm) and CD131, CD31, VEGFR1, VE-cadherin, TF, vWF, SRF, and SMA expression (RT-PCR). CD131 expression
was lost under all culture conditions; fibrinogen promoted VEGFR1, TF, and vWF expression. Fibrinogen/DMEM strengthened TF and vWF and induced
VE-cadherin, SRF, and SMA expression; VEGFR1 expression was lost. PDGF strengthened VE-cadherin, SRF, and SMA and weakened TF and vWF
expression. Collagen/laminin induced TF, vWF, SRF, and SMA expression. VEGF induced CD31, VE-cadherin, TF, vWF, and SRF expression. D, cells
(11th passage) were seeded on gelatin-coated plates and cocultured for one to three passages with 5 μg/mL AS or AS-Tspan8 exosomes or VEGF:

after 4 to 6 weeks (five passages). These cells were CD133+,
CD184+, Tspan8+, CD49c+, VEGFR2low, CD31−, VEGFR1−, and
CD11b− and partly took up Dio-Ac-LDL. They could be maintained in MCDB131 medium in the absence of AS-Tspan8
exosomes for >15 passages (Fig. 6A). As compared with mature ECs, cells from the 11th passage, analyzed by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry, showed higher CD133, VEGFR2,
CD146, and vWF expression; high CD184 and Tspan8; but
lower CD31 and VEGFR1 and unaltered CD49c expression
(Fig. 6B). To further control for the suggested nature of
ECP, cells from the fifth passage were exposed to selective
culture conditions, known to promote ECP differentiation.
On passaging on fibrinogen, they expressed VEGFR1, TF,

and vWF. When passaged on a collagen/laminin mixture together with VEGF, cells acquired the cobblestone phenotype
of differentiated EC; CD31 expression was induced, TF expression was strengthened, and VEGFR1 expression was lost.
In the presence of fibrinogen plus platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), cells strongly proliferated, exhibited reduced
TF and vWF expression, but impressively produced serum response factor (SRF) and SMA (Fig. 6C).
Having shown selection and maintenance of ECP with differentiation potential from AoR in the presence of low-level
AS-Tspan8 exosomes, we asked whether these cells can be
driven into differentiation by higher AS-Tspan8 exosome
concentrations. Cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates

for three passages in the presence of 5 μg/mL AS or ASTspan8 exosomes or 5 ng/mL VEGF. Both VEGF and ASTspan8 exosomes, but not AS exosomes, induced formation
of cable-like structures, loss of CD133 and VEGFR2, but upregulation of CD31, VEGFR1, and TF expression, acquiring an
expression profile similar to mature AoR-EC. RAEC, bone
marrow cell (BMC), and BMC-derived ECP (31) served as
controls (Fig. 6D).
Thus, exosomes can bind to EC and potentially ECP via
Tspan8-associated CD49d. Exosomes become internalized
and exosomal proteins and/or mRNA induce gene expression
that suffices for activation of quiescent EC. AS-Tspan8 exosomes also allow for survival of ECP. ECP can be driven into
EC and SM differentiation depending on the environment or
toward mature EC by AS-Tspan8 exosomes.

Discussion
AS-Tspan8 exosomes strongly affect angiogenesis. As selective interference with tumor angiogenesis would provide
a powerful therapeutics (32), AS-Tspan8 exosomes could
become a most interesting carrier. Therefore, we started
to unravel their activity.
Exosomal Tspan8 and Tspan8-associated proteins initiate EC activation. AS tumors are vascularized, but do not
induce DIC. AS-Tspan8 tumors are highly vascularized and
induce DIC. Abundantly Tspan8-expressing ASML tumors
are poorly vascularized (3, 28). These three tumors strongly
express CD9, CD81, and CD151 (3, 4, 33). Coimmunoprecipitation of Tspan8 with integrins revealed that, in ASML cells,
Tspan8 interacts with CD104 and overexpression of CD104 in
AS-Tspan8 cells prevents angiogenesis (34). These findings
indicated that selective integrin associations with Tspan8
might be decisive for Tspan8 exosome–induced angiogenesis.
Indeed, comparing Tspan8 associations in AS-Tspan8 exosomes and CD9 associations in AS and AS-Tspan8 exosomes
revealed that CD49d associates with CD9, CD151, and
Tspan8 only in AS-Tspan8 exosomes. In contrast, CD49c associates with CD9 in both AS and AS-Tspan8 exosomes. This
implies that Tspan8 selectively recruits CD49d into exosomes
via yet unknown mechanisms.
The presence of Tspan8-associated CD49d is utmost important for AS-Tspan8 exosome–induced EC activation.
Whereas AS and AS-Tspan8 exosomes bind and become
internalized with comparable efficacy by fibroblasts, ASTspan8 exosomes bind with far higher efficacy than AS
exosomes to EC. Only AS-Tspan8 exosome binding/uptake
by EC is inhibited by D6.1 and anti-CD49d, whereas antiCD49c or anti-CD151 inhibit binding/uptake of AS and
AS-Tspan8 exosomes by fibroblasts. As only D6.1 inhibits
exosome binding/uptake by EC, although CD49d coimmunoprecipitates in AS-Tspan8 exosome lysates with CD9,
CD151, and Tspan8, we suggest that only Tspan8-associated
CD49d contributes to exosome-EC interactions, where the
Tspan8-CD49d complex could mediate firm adhesion.
A proteome analysis revealed that from 12 proteins enriched in AS-Tspan8 exosomes, 4 were adhesion molecules:
CD106, lamininR1, Mac2BP, and milk fat globule epidermal

1676

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

growth factor 8 protein (MFGE8). Their contribution to ASTspan8 exosome uptake remains to be explored. CD106 is a
CD49d ligand on EC, involved in reticulocyte-derived exosome binding to fibronectin (35), and also might contribute
by binding to CD49d on EC. Its involvement is supported by
anti-CD106 inhibiting AS-Tspan8 exosome uptake. Mac2BP
regulates cell adhesion and binds to endosialin, selectively
expressed by tumor vasculature (36, 37). In AS-Tspan8 exosomes, it may support EC binding. MFGE8, found in exosome-like vesicles, binds αvβ3 and αvβ5 and is involved in
apoptotic cell clearance (38). LamininR1 is engaged in adhesion, signal transduction, and matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) 2 activation (39). Experiments are in progress to control for these activities in AS-Tspan8 exosome–induced angiogenesis.
Additional AS-Tspan8 exosome–enriched proteins possibly
support EC survival. The major VAULT protein is important
in drug resistance (40). CD71 regulates proliferation and angiogenesis (41). HSPs are constitutively enriched in exosomes
(42) and exosomal HSP70 protects neurons from stress damage (43). The minichromosome maintenance complex member MCM7, highly expressed in many malignancies, is at the
core of the DNA replication process (44). Its transfer via exosomes could support DNA replication in proliferating EC.
Most of these proteins are frequently recovered in exosomes (42). One reason for their enrichment in AS-Tspan8
exosomes could rely on peculiarities of Tspan8 internalization. Tspan8, distinct from CD9 and CD151, may become,
at least partly, internalized via clathrin-coated pits.6 Selective
features of Tspan8 internalization/recruitment into exosomes could explain the different protein composition of
AS-Tspan8 versus AS exosomes.
Taken together, Tspan8 exosomes interact with EC. The
Tspan8 association with CD49d likely supports persisting
binding/uptake. LamininR1, Mac2BP, and MFGE8 may contribute to this selective interaction. Abundance of proteases
CD13 and MMPs (data not shown) in AS-Tspan8 exosomes
could facilitate the integration process. The major VAULT
protein CD71 and HSP70 might provide survival advantages.
Differential mRNA recovery in AS-Tspan8 exosomes and
altered protein and mRNA recovery in EC. AS-Tspan8 and
AS exosome mRNA profiles differ considerably. From 11
mRNAs expected to be relevant in targeted EC, elevated levels were confirmed for 5 mRNAs: the oncogene MycN, the
transcription factor Spi-C, the transcription elongation factor
ElonginC, GDF3, and FGFBP1. The angiogenic switch molecule FGFBP1 (45) and the nodal-like transforming growth
factor-β ligand GDF3 (46) are of special interest considering
the angiogenic activity of AS-Tspan8 exosomes. Both genes
were transiently recovered in EC after coculture with ASTspan8 exosomes, confirming AS-Tspan8 exosome integration in EC.
Strengthening our hypothesis that Tspan8 exosomes initiate a VEGF-independent proangiogenic pathway, VEGF protein (4) and mRNA recovery were poor in AS-Tspan8

exosomes. In addition, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, Tie-1,
and Tie-2 RNAs were not or poorly recovered (data not
shown).
Thus, exosomal mRNA becomes transferred and likely
contributes to AS-Tspan8 exosome–induced angiogenesis.
AS-Tspan8 exosome–initiated ECP maturation and
angiogenesis-related gene expression. Although AS-Tspan8
exosomes do not contain angiogenic factors, AoR-ECs respond with proliferation and cord formation comparable
with VEGF. AS-Tspan8 exosomes, but not VEGF, suffice for
long-term survival of ECP, which could be driven by additional factors into mature EC or SMC, but also can acquire an
EC-like phenotype by exposure to AS-Tspan8 exosomes.
Thus, AS-Tspan8 exosomes possess the potential to regulate
ECP in adults and possibly during embryogenesis. This is in
line with exosome-like argosomes acting as morphogen
transporters (13, 41, 47) and abundant Tspan8 expression
in vessel endothelium during embryogenesis (48).
Induction of EC migration correlates with CCR1, CCL20,
CXCL5, and MIF expression on coculture of EC with ASTspan8 exosomes. MIF promotes angiogenic growth factor
expression, possibly by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α stabilization (49), and stimulates MMP3 (50), expression of which was
also induced by AS-Tspan8 exosomes. Induced transcription
of angiopoietin-like 4 and a cDNA with similarity to vWF may
support the angiogenic switch. The effects of cDNA, coding
for signal transduction molecules and transcription factors,
remain to be explored; EC proliferation could well rely on
their abundance. On prolonged coculture, VEGFR1, TF,
vWF, Tspan8, and, in the presence of VEGF, VEGFR2 are
transcribed, which complements motility-related gene expression in promoting EC proliferation and differentiation.
Altogether, dependent on their origin, exosomes induce
angiogenesis without an initial requirement for known angiogenic factors. They also support survival, expansion, and
maturation of ECP. Tetraspanins are consistently recovered

in exosomes (13, 21, 42), yet there had been no clue for their
exosomal activity. We show that tetraspanins can be a central component for exosome binding and integration into
distinct target cells. For EC, one of the “master” molecules
is Tspan8 as long as the originating cell expresses appropriate cooperating partners, such as CD49d. We will proceed
with a comprehensive definition of angiogenesis-promoting
and angiogenesis-inhibiting proteins, mRNA and miRNA,
whose integration into exosomes becomes guided by Tspan8
and modulates EC fate. Tspan8 exosomes playing a central
role in tumor-induced local and systemic angiogenesis,
modulated exosomes could possibly become a highly effective antiangiogenic drug, whereas ex vivo expansion of undifferentiated ECP could serve as a tool in reconstructive
medicine.
