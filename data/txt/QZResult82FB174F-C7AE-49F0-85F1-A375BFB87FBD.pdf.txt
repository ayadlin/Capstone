BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of the addition of pamidronate to chemotherapy for
treatment of osteosarcoma. METHODS: The authors treated 40 patients with osteosarcoma with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate with the addition of pamidronate 2 mg/kg/dose (max dose 90 mg) monthly for 12 doses.
Survival, event-free survival (EFS), and durability of orthopedic reconstruction were evaluated. RESULTS: For patients
with localized disease, event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years was 72% and overall survival 93%. For patients with
metastatic disease, EFS at 5 years was 45% and overall survival 64%. Toxicity was similar to patients treated with
chemotherapy alone. Thirteen of 14 uncemented implants demonstrated successful osteointegration. Among
allograft reconstructions, there were 2 graft failures, 4 delayed unions, and 6 successful grafts. Overall, 5 of 33
reconstructions failed. There were no stress fractures or growth disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Pamidronate can be
safely incorporated with chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. It does not impair the efficacy of

The identification of effective chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma (OS) has led to significant improvement

in patient outcome.1‥2 There are only 4 chemotherapy agents widely accepted to have efficacy against osteosarcoma: doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), and ifosfamide.3-7 The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) performed a randomized, multi-institution, cooperative trial to test the benefit of the addition of ifosfamide to a regimen of
cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX.8 The addition of ifosfamide did not result in improved event-free survival (EFS) or
overall survival. There is a continued need for new therapeutic approaches.
Bisphosphonates are analogues of endogenous pyrophosphates. In vivo, bisphosphonates bind strongly to hydroxyapatite on bone surfaces and are delivered to sites of increased bone formation or resorption. They are widely used to treat
hypercalcemia of malignancy. Initially, it was felt that the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates was exclusively to stabilize bone. More recently it has become apparent that bisphosphonates have direct effects on tumor cells.9 In vitro,
bisphosphonate treatment of myeloma cells leads to growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis.10 Bisphosphonates
induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines.11 Bisphosphonates appear to inhibit adhesion of tumor cells to bone
matrix.12 Bisphosphonates may also inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, which are used by tumor cells to invade tissue and
establish metastases.13
Numerous in vitro and xenograft studies support the concept that bisphosphonates have activity against osteosarcoma, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Investigators have studied human and animal cell lines and spontaneous osteosarcoma arising in murine models. They have studied alendronate, clodronate, minodronate, pamidronate, and
zoledronate14-37 (Table 1). Oligonucleotide microarray assays of human osteosarcoma offer additional support for the
concept of using bisphosphonates in osteosarcoma. Expression profiling of 30 osteosarcoma tumors from patients identified 104 genes differentially expressed between favorable and unfavorable responses to chemotherapy.36 A striking finding

was the significant decrease in osteoprotegerin, an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor. Additional genes involved in
osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, which were statistically different, included annexin 2, SMAD, PLA2G2A, and
TGFbeta1. ECM remodeling genes included desmoplakin,
SPARCL1, biglycan, and PECAM. Overexpression of desmoplakin (P ¼ .008), PECAM (P ¼ .028), and SPARCL1
(P ¼ .00,098) were associated with a favorable chemotherapy response, whereas overexpression of annexin2 (P ¼
.05), biglycan (P ¼ .025), and PLA2G2A (P ¼ .025) were
associated with an unfavorable chemotherapy response.
This suggests the interaction of the tumor with the microenvironment is a determinant of response to chemotherapy.
Bisphosphonates may have activity through disruption of
these interactions.

There are a large number of bisphosphonate compounds in clinical use. Osteosarcoma is most common in
the second decade of life. We initiated our clinical trial in
2003. We needed to identify a bisphosphonate which had
been used in this younger population and demonstrated a
good safety profile. We also needed to identify a dose and
schedule of administration which could be applied in children and adolescents as well as in adults. Pamidronate had
been the most widely used bisphosphonate in children and
young adults (Table 2). Pamidronate has been used to treat
cancer-related hypercalcemia in children38-40 Pamidronate
has been used to treat fibrous dysplasia in children with the
McCune-Albright syndrome.41 Pamidronate has been used
to treat a teenager with multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis.27 Pamidronate has been used to treat osteogenesis

imperfecta, including some very young children.43,45
Pamidronate has been given to children with osteoporosis
resulting from a variety of etiologies.46 Pamidronate has
been safely given simultaneously with chemotherapy to children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).44 Although
other bisphosphonates were in clinical use, this drove our
selection of this agent for this clinical trial.
The purpose of this trial was to determine whether
pamidronate can safely be given in conjunction with
chemotherapy to young patients with osteosarcoma. We
wished to determine the feasibility of this approach and to
determine whether the combination of chemotherapy
with pamidronate results in increased toxicity or in
decreased efficacy against tumor. We wished to assess the
ability of pamidronate to improve the survival of endoprosthetic reconstruction.

Patients
We offered participation in the clinical trial to all patients
with newly diagnosed previously untreated osteosarcoma
presenting to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Department of Pediatrics. This clinical trial
was approved by the Memorial Hospital Institutional
Review Board. Patients were eligible when they had
adequate renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, and cardiac function. Exclusion criteria included prior treatment for any
cancer, prior history of Paget disease, prior history of pericarditis, myocarditis or cardiac conduction abnormalities,
and pregnancy or lactation. All patients or their guardians
were required to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. Because the primary aim of the study
was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of contemporaneous administration of pamidronate and chemotherapy,
patients with both localized and metastatic osteosarcoma
were eligible for participation.
We enrolled 40 patients on study. Twenty-nine
patients presented without clinically detectable metastatic
disease, and 11 patients had clinically detectable metastatic disease at initial presentation. Patients ranged in age
from 7 to 36 years with a median age of 15 years. There
were 20 males and 20 females. Two patients had a pathological fracture, each successfully treated with limb
preservation.

mor, followed by resection of any pulmonary metastases,
followed by a period of maintenance chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m2 administered as a 4 hour infusion 4 times with doxorubicin, twice
during induction at Weeks 0 and 5, and twice during
maintenance at Weeks 0 and 5. Doxorubicin was administered as a 15-30 minute infusion at a dose of 37.5 mg/
m2/day for 2 consecutive days 6 times, twice during
induction at Weeks 0 and 5, and 4 times during maintenance at Weeks 0, 5, 10, and 15. We administered dexrazoxane 375 mg/m2 as a 15-30 minute infusion 15
minutes before each dose of doxorubicin. The first 4
courses were administered with cisplatin, twice during
induction and twice during maintenance. High dose
methotrexate (HDMTX) 12 g/m2 with a maximum dose
of 20 g was administered as a 4 hour infusion followed by
leucovorin administration at a dose of 10 mg (not
adjusted to body surface area) beginning 24 hours from
the initiation of the methotrexate infusion and continuing
until the serum methotrexate level was less than 1 
107M (100 nanomolars). Serum methotrexate levels and
renal function were monitored daily, and hydration, alkalinization, and leucovorin doses were specified in the
event of delayed methotrexate excretion.45 HDMTX was
administered 12 times, 4 times during induction at Weeks
3, 4, 8, and 9; and 8 times during maintenance at Weeks
3, 4, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, and 19. In an effort to maintain the
dose intensity of doxorubicin, the protocol specified that
if there were a delay greater than 1 week between the first
and the second of each pair of HDMTX administrations,
the second of the pair was to be omitted.
Experience with pamidronate in children has used
doses from 1 to 6 mg/kg given over the course of 1 to 3
days. If we use bisphosphonates to treat osteosarcoma, we
must administer the bisphosphonate with chemotherapy
agents with potential nephrotoxicity. We chose a dose of
2 mg/kg (maximum dose 90 mg) given in 1 day as a safe
dose. We specified that administration of pamidronate
would be separated from administration of cisplatin or
high-dose methotrexate by at least 72 hours. Pamidronate
was administered once each month for a total of 12 doses.
The first dose of pamidronate was given during the first
cycle of chemotherapy. Pamidronate was always separated
from cisplatin and HDMTX by a minimum of 72 hours.
Pamidronate was administered as a 2-hour infusion.

Graft failure was defined by removal for any reason,
persistent nonunion of 18 months after surgery, or 12
months after the conclusion of chemotherapy. Prosthetic
failure was defined as the removal of an implant, for any
reason, or pain with progressive radiolucency. Successful
osteointegration was defined by retention of the prosthesis, no pain, no radiolucency, and progressive bone hypertrophy around the implant.

final pathological review. Reconstructions varied based on
the location and circumstances, including patient growth
potential and the presence of metastatic disease. There
were 3 amputations, and 5 patients who did not have any
reconstruction. There were 23 prosthetic reconstructions,
including 19 pure implants (1 press fit, 14 Compress, 4
cemented stems) and 4 allograft prosthetic composites
(APC) where the stem was cemented into the allograft,
and the remaining stem was press fit into the host bone
(3 patients) or cemented into the host bone (1 patient).
There were 11 allografts, including the 4 APCs. Two of
the intercalary grafts were coupled with vascularized
fibular transplants. We fixed the allografts with plates in
all cases, and the APCs also had intramedullary stem
transfixation. A vascularized fibula alone was used for
1 intercalary reconstruction.
Mobilization was based on a standard protocol.
Cemented implants were allowed immediate weight bearing. Uncemented implants, including the Compress
stems, were protected by toe-touch weight bearing for 6
weeks then half weight bearing for 6 weeks. APCs were
protected by half weight bearing for 12 weeks. Allografts
and vascularized grafts were protected with half-weight
bearing until there was painless radiographic union. The
vascularized fibula was then braced for an additional 2
years until graft hypertrophy. Five of the 23 prosthetic
reconstructions also included extensible shaft segments.

Endpoints and Statistical Methods
Endpoints were EFS, overall survival, toxicity, and success
rates for endoprosthetic reconstruction after definitive
resection of primary tumor. Actuarial curves were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method for EFS and
overall survival. Toxicity was monitored with National
Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria, with
special attention to hepatotoxicity, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw. We
compared the incidence of grade III and IV adverse events
for these selected toxicities in this regimen to the incidence in 390 patients who received the identical chemotherapy regimen without pamidronate in the prospective
randomized trial performed by the pediatric cooperative
groups.8

RESULTS
Data were analyzed as of April, 2010. Median follow-up
for the entire cohort of 40 patients, including patients
who experienced an event, was 53 months.
EFS and Survival
EFS for 29 patients who presented with localized disease
was 72% at 5 years from study enrollment (Fig. 1). EFS
for the 11 patients who presented with clinically detectable metastatic disease was 45% at the same time point.
Overall survival for the localized patients at 5 years was
93%; for patients who presented with metastatic disease,
overall survival at 5 years was 64% (Fig. 2). We did not
observe local recurrence. Two patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome as the first event. All other first events
were metastatic recurrence.
Toxicity
The toxicities observed in patients in this study were similar to the toxicities observed in patients treated with the
same chemotherapy regimen who did not receive pamidronate. Hypocalcemia was common after administration

of pamidronate, but only 2 patients experienced symptoms, including perioral numbness and paresthesias of the
hands and feet (Table 3). Symptomatic hypocalcemia
responded promptly to oral calcium supplementation,
and subsequent administration of pamidronate preceded
by oral calcium supplementation was not associated with
symptoms. With subsequent administration of pamidronate, the incidence of hypocalcemia decreased. We
observed ototoxicity grade 3 in 6 of 40 patients (15%;
95% confidence interval [CI], 6%-30%). Ototoxicity
grade 3 was observed in 39 of 390 patients treated with
the same chemotherapy regimen without bisphosphonate
in the pediatric cooperative group trial (P ¼ .29; Fisher
exact test; Table 4). We observed nephrotoxicity grade 3
in 1 of 40 patients (2.5%; 95% CI, 0.1%-13%). Nephrotoxicity grade 3 was observed in 8 of 390 patients
treated with the same chemotherapy regimen without
bisphosphonate in the pediatric cooperative group trial
(Fisher exact test P ¼ .58; Table 4).There were no cases of
osteonecrosis of the jaw, either during study therapy or
during follow-up. No patients sustained atypical subtrochanteric or other long bone fractures, which have been

Orthopedic Reconstruction
The 11 allograft reconstructions included 4 osteoarticular
tibial replacements (all plated, 3 with intramedullary
cement), 1 intercalary femur replacement (plated without
cement), 2 intercalary femoral replacements with intramedullary vascularized fibulas (plated without cement),
and 4 alloprosthetic composites (1 proximal humerus,1
proximal femur, and 2 proximal tibias, all of which had
intramedullary prosthetic stems; 2 had supplemental
plates, and 1of 4 was cemented into the remaining host
bone.) The number of variables among the patients is too
great to allow meaningful comparison. Due to 3-6–
month variation in the intervals between extremity films,
the time-to-union results may not be precise. Nevertheless, radiographic union was achieved in 11 of 13 osteosynthesis sites at a mean of 19.4 months (standard
deviation [SD], 7.2 months). Our impression was that the
healing was at least as fast as what has historically been
seen for similar reconstructions during chemotherapy.
Ultimate union and graft retention are more reproducible
and clinically meaningful outcomes.
Five reconstructions failed. One (of 1) uncemented
press-fit stems had aseptic loosening and was converted to
a cemented stemmed implant that had a stable 2 mm
radiolucent line over one-third of the stem length, 5 years
and 5 months after implantation. Four allografts failed, 2
from infection (1 exchanged for a cement intercalary
spacer and 1 amputation) and 2 from nonunion, successfully treated by autogenous bone grafting and exchange
from plate to rod fixation. A fifth allograft, part of an
APC, had a persistent asymptomatic nonunion that had
not failed nor required surgery by the time of the patient’s

DISCUSSION
Successful treatment for osteosarcoma requires the combination of effective systemic therapy and surgery to remove
all sites of clinically detectable disease. One treatment
strategy for osteosarcoma is to administer chemotherapy,
followed by definitive surgical resection of primary tumor
and metastatic disease if necessary, followed by additional
adjuvant chemotherapy. A second strategy is primary definitive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Different combinations of the 4 active chemotherapy drugs
have been used in both strategies. Large trials from single
institutions and cooperative groups have achieved similar
outcomes.1,8,49-51 We need to identify new agents and
treatment strategies.
The bisphosphonates are good candidates to employ
in the treatment of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma cells
demonstrate upregulation of many genes whose normal
functions are to participate in osteogenesis and whose
functions can be inhibited by bisphosphonates. In addition, evidence is accruing that bisphosphonates may have
the ability to interfere with the processes used by tumor
cells to establish metastases. The treatment of osteosarcoma requires surgical resection of tumor-bearing bone
and reconstruction of the resected area with metal or bone
graft. Osteosarcoma occurs predominantly in young
patients and long-term survival of the reconstruction is
essential. Bisphosphonates may improve the outcome for
osteosarcoma by direct antitumor effects, decreasing the
risk of metastasis, and improving the durability of reconstruction following tumor resection.
Our experience represents a pilot study with a single
bisphosphonate, pamidronate. We chose pamidronate
because there was prior experience with pamidronate in
children with cancer. Newer bisphosphonates, such as
zoledronate, are significantly more potent than pamidronate. There are more data from preclinical studies for
zoledronate in osteosarcoma than for any other
bisphosphonate. Future clinical trials of bisphosphonates
Cancer

in osteosarcoma will almost certainly employ zoledronate.
It is important to recognize that although zoledronate is
more potent than pamidronate, it is also associated with a
greater risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw, a significant risk
associated with bisphosphonate therapy.52 Its risk in
young children with deciduous teeth is unknown.
We treated 40 patients with conventional chemotherapy for osteosarcoma and pamidronate. Given the
limitations of small patient sample and limited duration
of follow-up, we observed no statistically significant
increase in toxicity. We saw no osteonecrosis of the jaw.
We believe that pamidronate can safely be incorporated
into a multiagent chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of osteosarcoma. If zoledronate replaces pamidronate in the treatment strategy, then we will need to
acquire similar safety data. We observed EFS and overall
survival for our patients very similar to our prior experience and to the published experience in the literature for
similar chemotherapy treatment regimens. This was a
small single-arm study that included both localized and
metastatic patients. We cannot draw any firm conclusions
about the impact of pamidronate on the efficacy of treatment for osteosarcoma, but pamidronate does not appear
to have impaired the outcome.
In a series of 108 patients with primary bone sarcoma treated at MSKCC, 15 (14%) patients suffered fractures during treatment.53 These children remain at risk
for osteoporosis and insufficiency fractures throughout
their lifetimes. Treatment-related osteopenia is an underrecognized problem in young patients receiving chemotherapy.54 In adults with osteoporosis, treatments with
bisphosphonates resulted in a 50% decrease in fracture
rates after 1 year of treatment. These adults achieved bone
mass gains of 2-4% per year during the first 4 years of
treatment. Even more devastating for these patients, pathologic fractures through a tumor can affect survival and
local recurrence rates. In a multicenter, retrospective,
matched-control review, patients with osteosarcoma and a
pathologic fracture had a 5-year survival rate of 55% compared with 77% for patients without fracture. Local recurrence at 5 years was also increased in the group with
pathologic fractures (25% compared with 4%).55
Most patients with osteosarcoma undergo limb-preserving surgical resection with insertion of an endoprosthesis. During chemotherapy, ingrowth into the surface of
these prostheses is delayed. Aseptic loosening, with poor
bone/implant interface contact remains 1 of the major factors leading to the necessity for implant revision surgery.
At MSKCC, 15.8% of prosthetic knee reconstructions

1741

require revision for aseptic loosening. Overall prosthesis
failure-free rates were 82%, 71%, and 50% at 3, 5, and 10
years, respectively, after initial implantation.56 At the
University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), 11.6%
of hip prostheses required revision for aseptic loosening or
fatigue failure, and failure-free survival at 7 years was
69%.57 Even recent uncemented prostheses and implants
with novel Compression fixation have 12% early failure
by 5 years.58 Currently, young patients who survive osteosarcoma can anticipate multiple revisions of their prostheses during their lifetime. Bisphosphonate therapy may
contribute to improved prosthetic longevity by several
mechanisms including 1) improved bone density and
strength, 2) promoting more robust bone ingrowth into
porous surfaces of uncemented prostheses, and 3) stabilization of the bone-prosthesis or bone-cement interface
retarding osteoclastic bone resorption stimulated by particulate-wear debris. Bisphosphonates improve the fixation interface and can be predicted to improve failure-free
implant survival.
We observed a high rate of successful osteointegration of endoprosthetic reconstructions and union following allografts. Overall durability of reconstructions has
been good. We did not formally evaluate bone density in
patients receiving pamidronate; such prospective evaluation in future trials of more potent bisphosphonates such
as zoledronate may provide additional information on the
usefullness of bisphosphonates in patients with sarcomas
receiving therapy associated with an increased risk of
osteopenia. Again, the limitations of a small single-arm
study preclude firm conclusions, but these outcomes compare favorably with our prior institutional experience.
Our experience with pamidronate and chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma suggests that we
can safely incorporate pamidronate with chemotherapy. It
suggests the efficacy of therapy is comparable to our prior
experience. It suggests that bisphosphonates may improve
the durability of reconstruction. These results provide feasibility data, support, and justification for a prospective
randomized trial of the addition of bisphosphonates to
chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. It seems
appropriate that such a trial should use a newer, more
potent bisphosphonate than pamidronate, such as zoledronate. The use of zoledronate will require vigilant monitoring for toxicity.
