ABSTRACT:
The neuropilins (Nrps) are multifunctional proteins involved in development,
immunity and cancer. Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), or its homologue neuropilin-2 (Nrp2),
are coreceptors that enhance responses to several growth factors (GFs) and other
mediators. Nrps are coreceptors for the class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3), involved in
axonal guidance, and several members of the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) family. However, recent findings reveal they have a much broader spectrum
of activity. They bind transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and its receptors,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (cMet), platelet derived growth
factor (PDGF) and its receptors, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and integrins. Nrps
also promote Hedgehog signaling. These ligands and pathways are all relevant to
angiogenesis and wound healing. In the immune system, the Nrps are expressed
primarily by dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and exert mainly
inhibitory effects. In cancer, Nrps have been linked to a poor prognosis, which is
consistent with their numerous interactions with ligands and receptors that promote
tumor progression. We hypothesize that Nrps boost responses by capturing ligands,
regulating GF receptor expression, endocytosis and recycling, and possibly also by
signaling independently. Importantly, they promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), and the survival of cancer stem cells. The recent finding that Nrps bind and
internalize cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with arginine/lysine-rich C-terminal
motifs (C-end rule; e.g., RXXR) is of interest. These CPPs can be coupled to large drugs
for cancer therapy. Almost all studies have been preclinical, but findings suggest Nrps
are excellent targets for anti-cancer drug development.

INTRODUCTION

homodimers, but Nrp1/Nrp2 heterodimers also occur
[17]. Nrp1 (also denoted CD304 or BDCA-4) was first
identified as a receptor for the class 3 semaphorins
(SEMA3) [18-26], which are involved in axonal guidance
in embryonic development. In this function, Nrp1 acts as
a coreceptor for SEMA3 family members and promotes
their interaction with plexins. Subsequently, the Nrps
were identified as coreceptors for several members of
the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family
[27-32]. Nrp1 was found to interact with VEGF-A165 (and
other VEGFs) and the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
VEGFR2, and to enhance signaling through this pathway
and promote angiogenesis. Heparin markedly increases the

The neuropilins (Nrps) are multifunctional singlepass transmembrane proteins that play an important
role in development, immunity and cancer [1-14].
Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), or its homologue neuropilin-2
(Nrp2), are coreceptors that enhance responses to several
growth factors and other mediators under physiological
and pathological conditions. They are expressed by
endothelial cells, several other normal cell types, and often
by malignant tumor cells [5, 14-16]. Nrp1 and Nrp2 have
44% homology and share many structural and biological
properties [1, 2, 9-14]. Nrps are usually expressed as

PROPERTIES OF THE NRPS

affinity of VEGF for Nrp1, and appears to contribute to the
formation of a complex incorporating VEGF, Nrp1 and
VEGFR2 [1, 2, 28]. Nrp2 has different (but overlapping)
binding preferences for VEGF family members, and is
a coreceptor for VEGFR3 that is involved in lymphatic
endothelial cell function [32]. In view of this, the current
concept is that the Nrps are coreceptors for SEMA3 and
VEGF family members.
Interestingly, the activation of VEGF receptors by
VEGF can occur in the absence of Nrps [13], but Nrp1
mediates endothelial cell migration and is essential in
angiogenesis as shown in knockout mice. This could
occur because Nrps boost responses to VEGF, and a
small decrease in VEGF availability can have major
consequences as demonstrated by the embryonic death
of mice lacking even one allele of the VEGF gene.
However, alternatively, this might occur because Nrp1
also interacts with other key receptors involved in
angiogenesis. Indeed, new findings show that the Nrps
have a much broader spectrum of ligands than initially
recognized [33-63], as outlined in Table 1 and Figure
1A,B. Nrp1 can bind transforming growth factor β1
(TGF-β1) and its receptors [33-36], hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) and its receptor (cMet) [37-39, 45], platelet
derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptors [40-45],
and some fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) [37]. However,
Nrp1 had no effect on the response of human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to FGF-2 [64], and the
relevance of interactions with FGFs remains unclear. Nrp1
also interacts with integrins [46-48], numerous synthetic
or natural cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [53-57], and
other molecules. Nrps contribute to cell adhesion in
embryonic cells and some other cell types [65]. A caveat
is that the importance of other Nrp ligands (non-VEGF)
in the context of angiogenesis has not been established,
and a considerable amount of work will be required to
elucidate their role. In addition, the Nrps are involved in
the regulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling [66, 67], and
the survival and self-renewal of cancer stem cells [6870]. Nrp1 also binds to itself [37], which may be relevant
to some cell-cell interactions. The molecular features
responsible for this remarkable variety of interactions are
for the most part unknown, but crystallographic studies
and other observations have provided valuable information
as outlined below.
The importance of Nrps in angiogenesis and axonal
guidance is firmly established, as noted above. However,
their role in immunity, cancer and other processes is not
as clear. In this review, we will focus mainly on immune
aspects and cancer, especially as related to non-classical
Nrp ligands such as TGF-β and HGF. We will also
examine the potential of Nrps as targets for cancer therapy.

Cells expressing Nrp1 and Nrp2 in normal tissues
and tumors
Nrp1 and/or Nrp2 expression has been reported in a
wide variety of cells including endothelial cells, neurons,
pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes, melanocytes and
osteoblasts [6, 14-16]. Nrp expression has been studied
both in vitro and in vivo, and in most cases confirmed in
vivo. In addition, expression occurs in some epithelial
cells of several organs (e.g., skin, breast, prostate, GI
tract, lung, kidney and bladder), as recently reviewed [14].
The endothelial cells of arteries express primarily Nrp1,
whereas the endothelial cells of veins and lymphatics
express predominantly Nrp2. In the immune system,
Nrp1 is expressed by thymocytes [71-74], plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pDCs) [75-76], and regulatory T cells (Tr
or Treg cells) [4, 33, 77-79]. In mice, Nrp1 is expressed
by the majority of resting or activated Treg cells [4], while
in humans it is poorly expressed by resting Treg cells but
induced in a subpopulation of activated Treg cells [80, 81].
Nrp1 is also expressed by recent thymic emigrant IL-17producing invariant NKT cells in lymphoid organs, and is
a useful marker for these cells [82].
Some studies have shown discordant results
regarding the expression of Nrp1 and Nrp2 in normal
tissues and tumors, which probably reflects technical
differences. Jubb et al. [15, 16] addressed this question
by staining with antibodies that were strictly validated for
immunohistochemical analysis, and they also employed
in situ hybridization. In the case of tumors, they observed
that the vasculature is positive for Nrp1 [15] and Nrp2
[16] in the vast majority of cases. However, Nrp
expression by tumor cells varied considerably from one
tumor type to another. For example, Nrp1 positivity by
tumor cells was recorded in 6% of primary and 14% of
metastatic breast cancers, and 36% of primary and 50%
of metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs)
[15]. The frequency of tumors with Nrp2+ tumor cells
was comparable to Nrp1 in breast cancer and NSCLC
[16]. In contrast, 85% of melanomas had Nrp2+ tumor
cells. In positive tumors, the percent of Nrp+ tumor cells
ranged from small to almost 100%. These marker profiles
were determined by single Nrp1 or Nrp2 staining, and the
frequency of positive tumors would likely be higher if
analyzed by double staining. It should be noted that others
have reported a much higher frequency of Nrp2 expression
(~ 50%) by tumor cells in breast cancer [81]. The potential
significance of Nrp expression in tumors is addressed in
another section below.

Figure 1: Neuropilin (Nrp) structure and hypothetical model of interaction with multiple growth factors. A. The general

domain structure of Nrp1 and Nrp2 is shown. There are five extracellular domains, a single-pass TMD domain, and a short cytosolic tail
lacking tyrosine kinase activity. Nrp1 and Nrp2a (but not Nrp2b) have a C-terminal SEA-sequence motif that binds to synectin. There are
also splice variants of the Nrps (not shown), including soluble forms lacking the c domain, TMD and cytoplasmic segments. SEMA3s bind
to the a1/a2/b1 segment, and VEGFs binds to b1/b2. The binding sites of other GFs are not well characterized. CendR peptides bind to the
b1 domain (see text). The c domain contributes to receptor dimerization. B. The Nrps bind ligands of at least five major types of soluble
mediators, as well as their signaling receptors. The figure presents a hypothetical model of how these signaling pathways may interact.
This includes TGF-β1, VEGF family, HGF, PDGF-BB, and the SEMA3 family. See Table 1 for a list of ligands and references. Except for
SEMA3s, the Nrps are not essential for receptor signaling but they enhance the response. The GF signaling pathways intersect extensively
with numerous potential outcomes. TGF-β exerts antiproliferative and immunosuppressive effects through canonical (Smad2/3) signaling.
However, TGF-β noncanonical signaling (or other GF pathways) can inhibit Smad2/3 signaling. Notably, p130Cas is phosphorylated in
response to Nrp-binding GFs, and can block Smad2/3 signaling while favoring noncanonical signaling. SEMA3s interact with Nrps and
plexins (the signaling receptors) to activate signaling pathways that regulate axonal guidance, as well as endothelial, immune and tumor
cell responses, usually in an inhibitory way. Abbreviations: CendR; C-end rule peptides; cMet, hepatocyte growth factor receptor; EMT,

Structural features of Nrp1 and Nrp2 and
coreceptor functions

of the Nrps to capture the soluble ligands on the cell
membrane and increase their availability for interaction
with the signaling receptors. This might occur as part of
multi-component signaling complexes that are stabilized
by the Nrps. In accord with this hypothesis, there is
evidence that Nrp1 knockdown in some cell types results
in a dramatic decrease in VEGFR2 protein levels [69].
Furthermore, in the case of TGF-β we have shown that the
Nrps have an important role in the activation of the latent
cytokine, as discussed below.
An alternative hypothesis, not necessarily
compatible with the previous one, is that Nrps contribute
to endocytosis and/or routing of the receptor complex,
which is some cases enhances signaling. For instance,
there is evidence that clathrin-mediated endocytosis
promotes TGF-β receptor signaling [91, 92]. It has been
reported that Nrp1, through its cytoplasmic C-terminal
motif (SEA), acts as a general adaptor by binding to
the cytoplasmic PDZ protein synectin (GIPC) [46, 93].
Synectin, along with other proteins such as Dab2, links
vesicles of the clathrin-dependent endosomal pathway
with molecular motor myosin VI (Myo6), to promote
endosomal trafficking [93, 94]. However, synectin does
not appear essential for some key Nrp functions [13], and
its role in this context remains to be clearly defined.

The molecular features of Nrp1 and Nrp2 (Nrp2a
and Nrp2b) have been recently reviewed [1, 2, 1014], and only a brief outline is provided here. Nrp1 and
Nrp2a are 130-140 kd type-1 membrane glycoproteins
with 44% sequence homology, similar domain structure
and an overlapping set of ligands (Fig. 1A). They have
an extracellular portion consisting of five domains, a
transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail of
∼44 amino acids (aa). The cytoplasmic segment has no
known signaling motif, but in Nrp1 and Nrp2a there is a
C-terminal SEA motif that interacts with the PDZ protein
denoted neuropilin-1 interacting protein (NIP), GIPC or
synectin [46, 84-87]. The extracellular domains consists
of a1/a2, b1/b2 and c (MAM) domains. The a1/a2 domains
(or CUB domains) consist of ∼110 aa each and have
homology of the C1s/C1r complement proteins. The b1/
b2 domains are ∼150 aa each, and have homology to the
C1/C2 domains of coagulation factors V and VIII. The c
domain is thought to be involved receptor dimerization,
but other segments may also contribute, including the
transmembrane domain [89]. Notably, a synthetic peptide
derived from the transmembrane segment of Nrp1
disrupted its coreceptor functions and showed therapeutic
benefit in a glioblastoma model [89, 90].
In addition to these classic forms of neuropilin (Nrp1
and Nrp2a), several isoforms produced as splice variants
have been described. This includes soluble forms of both
Nrp1 and Nrp2, lacking the cytoplasmic, transmembrane
and c domains. There is also an alternative membrane form
of Nrp2 (Nrp2b) that lacks the cytoplasmic SEA motif and
does not bind synectin. Although Nrp1 and Nrp2 appear to
exist mostly as homodimers recent studies with mutants,
particularly dominant negative Nrp1 mutated forms,
reveal that Nrp1/Nrp2 heterodimers also occur [17]. The
biological significance of these various Nrp1 and Nrp2
splice variants and heterodimers is not well understood,
but they appear to be expressed differently in tissues and
are likely to also differ in function.
Although Nrp1 and Nrp2 both have affinity for
VEGF and SEMA3, there are differences, as seen in Table
1. Thus, Nrp1 interacts preferentially with SEMA3A,
whereas Nrp2 favors SEMA3F. With respect to the VEGF
family, both Nrp1 and Nrp2 bind multiple members, but
there is not a complete overlap in reactivity (Table 1).
The significance of these different affinities for various
mediators is unknown. As noted previously, a remarkable
feature of the Nrps is their ability to interact with both
the ligands and receptors of at least five unrelated families
of mediators (Fig. 1B, Table 1). In these interactions,
numerous studies have suggested that Nrps are chiefly
modulators of signaling, with VEGF being the prototypical
example [39], but how they achieve this function is largely
unknown. We speculate that this results from the ability

Phenotype of Nrp knockout mice
The importance of Nrps in development had been
demonstrated in knockout mice. Nrp1 knockout in mice
is embryonic lethal at 10 to 12.5 days [95, 96]. The
embryos die with several defects in cardiac and vascular
development, as well as disorganization of the pathway
and projection of nerve fibers. Conditional Nrp1 knockout
limited to endothelial cells is also associated with cardiac
and vascular defects [97]. The study of mice expressing a
mutant Nrp1 capable of binding VEGF, but not SEMA3,
revealed that SEMA3 signaling is not required for vascular
development but is essential for normal axonal pathfinding
by neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system
[98]. Interestingly, these mice had heart defects, suggesting
a role for both VEGF and SEMA3 in cardiac development.
Nrp1 overexpression in transgenic mice is also lethal at ~
12.5 days, and is associated with cardiac malformations,
increased blood vessels and capillaries, and nerve fiber
anomalies [99]. These findings clearly confirm the key
roles of Nrp1 in cardiac, vascular and nervous system
development. In contrast, Nrp2 knockout mice are viable,
but have decreased numbers of lymphatics and capillaries,
and defects of the central and peripheral nervous system
[100]. The embryos of Nrp1 and Nrp2 double-knockout
mice exhibit more severe anomalies and die earlier than
Nrp1 single-knockout mice [101].

Putative Nrp1 binding sites for its ligands

associated peptide of TGF-β1 (LAP-β1) has an argininerich C-terminus (RHRR) and binds to Nrps, as discussed
below.

The SEMA3s appear to bind to the a1/a2 domains,
whereas the VEGFs bind to the b1/b2 domains. Although
it has been thought these binding sites overlap, based
on competition [102] and mutation [103] studies, some
recent studies suggest that they do not but this remains
controversial. For instance, Pan et al. [104] found that
an anti-Nrp1 antibody (anti-Nrp1A) that blocks SEMA3
binding does not block VEGF, whereas an antibody
(anti-Nrp1B) that blocks VEGF does not block SEMA3.
This is in accord with the study of Appleton et al. [105].
These authors analyzed crystal structures of Nrp1
and Nrp2 fragments alone or bound to antibodies that
selectively block either SEMA3 or VEGF. The location
of the antibody epitopes as well as in vitro experiments
suggested that VEGF and SEMA3 did not directly
compete for binding. The analysis of Nrp1 domain
deletions or mutations by Gu et al. [103] showed that the
a1/a2 domains bind SEMA3, while the b1/b2 domains
bind VEGF. However, deletion of the b1 domain also
reduced SEMA3 binding. Of note, mutating seven amino
acids in the a1 domain of Nrp1 abrogated its capacity
to bind SEMA3, but did not prevent binding to VEGF,
VEGFR2 or Plexin A1.
Recent crystal structure studies of Nrp1, especially
of the b1 and b2 domains, as well as other evidence, reveal
probable sites of interaction with a number of unrelated
ligands. Lee et al. [106] reported that the b1 domain
has a cleft with negative charge, and suggested that the
positively charged C-terminal tails of VEGF and SEMA3
bind in this location. Vander Kooi et al. [107] examined
the crystal structure of the b1 and b2 domain, with
bound Tuftsin (TKPR), a peptide mimetic of the exon-8
C-terminal motif of VEGF165 (KPRR). Tuftsin competes
with VEGF165 for binding. From the crystal structure, it
was observed that Tuftsin binds to the electronegative b1domain pocket. Furthermore, the terminal arginine residue
of Tuftsin appeared essential for binding. More recently,
Parker et al. [108] reported on the crystal structure of
VEGF-A bound to Nrp1. They found that binding occurs
through both the C-terminal VEGF sequence and an exon7 sequence. In accord with previous studies, a C-terminal
arginine was essential for high-affinity binding.
The importance of a terminal arginine residue is
consistent with the fact that a splice variant of VEGF
lacking it (VEGF-A165b; SLTRKD C-terminus) fails to
bind to Nrp1 [109]. Indeed, almost all VEGF-family
ligands, or mimetic peptides, that bind to Nrp1 have a
C-terminal arginine residue, consistent with the C-end
rule ([53]; see below). This appears to apply to VEGF121,
which was initially thought not to bind to Nrp1, but it
was later reported to have affinity for this receptor [110].
The only exceptions are C7C cyclic peptides isolated
from a phage library by Hong et al. [58], which had the
consensus sequence –RRXR-. Interestingly, latencywww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ROLE OF NRP1 IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
Expression in the thymus and periphery
There are a number of areas where Nrp1 appears to
contribute to immunity. It is involved in immune system
development and thymocyte differentiation [3, 71-74].
It has been reported to contribute to the formation of the
immune synapse between T cells and antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) [111]. Thus, it may have an important role in
antigen presentation, but a caveat is that effector T cells
(Teff) are mostly negative for Nrp1, and only a subset of
APCs (the pDCs) appears to be positive [4,75-77, 80].
In view of this, the role of Nrp1 in antigen presentation
remains to be clearly defined.

Immunoregulatory effects
Functionally, Nrp1 has been frequently linked to
immune inhibition. Several studies have detailed the
immunoregulatory activities of semaphorins, which can
be either inhibitory or stimulatory [112]. Most of these
immune effects have been attributed to SEMA classes
4, 6 and 7, which do not bind Nrps [112]. However,
interactions of Nrp1 with SEMA3A can exert immune
effects [113, 114]. In this case, SEMA3A forms a
complex with Nrp1 (coreceptor) and plexin-A4 (signaling
receptor) to activate an immunoinhibitory response. In
accord with this, Plexin-A4 knockout mice have increased
antigen-induced CD4+ T-cell activation and experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [114]. T cells from
mice bearing a mutant Nrp1 unable to bind SEMA3, or
with SEMA3A knockout, also have immunoaggressive
features. SEMA3A is particularly relevant to anti-tumor
immunity, because tumors frequently produce this soluble
mediator, which inhibits human T-cell proliferation and
cytokine production [115]. This inhibitory effect has been
linked to a blockade of CD3/CD28-activated Ras/MAPK
signaling [115]. This work suggests that tumors can negate
anti-tumor immune responses by secreting SEMA3A,
although this requires confirmation in vivo. A caveat is
that most conventional T cells do not express Nrps, and
it is difficult to envisage a general immunosuppressive
mechanism based on this SEMA3A/Nrpl/PlexinA4 model
without further clarification.
Alternatively, Nrp1 might exert immunoinhibitory
effects by acting on Treg cells and/or enhancing
responses to TGF-β1 (see below), which is a powerful
immunosuppressive cytokine. As noted previously, Nrp1
is a marker of most murine Treg cells, and a subpopulation
925

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 921-939

of activated human Treg cells. At least in mice, it appears
to increase the length of interaction of Treg cells with
antigen in the process of antigen presentation by immature
DCs (iDCs), which favors the activation of Treg cells over
naïve T cells [78]. Furthermore, blocking Nrp1 interferes
with Treg-mediated suppression [78]. These findings
suggest that Nrp1 will promote the downregulation of
immune responses through increased Treg activity. This
view is supported by a recent study in conditional Nrp1
knockout mice [79]. These authors found that the lack of
Nrp1 on CD4+ T cells was associated with increased Th17
and decreased Treg functionality, as well as increased
EAE severity. In contrast, the expression of Nrp1 by
CD4+ cells was associated with suppressive activity,
both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, Nrp1+CD4+ T
cells were suppressive even when lacking the markers
of classical Treg cells such as Foxp3. The suppression
of Nrp1+CD4+ was inhibited by the blockade of TGF-β
but not IL-10. Taken together, these findings suggest
that Nrp1 expression by CD4+ cells is associated with
T-cell suppressor function, and this is mediated largely by
TGF-β.

The role of Nrp1 in pDCs deserves some
consideration. This small subpopulation of Nrp1+ DCs
[75] is importantly involved in combating viral infections,
and responds by producing large amounts of interferon
α (IFN-α) [122]. The pDCs recognize viral nucleic acids
through toll-like receptors (TLRs) and probably other
receptors. However, beyond this conventional model,
recent studies have shown they display plasticity as
DCs [122]. For instance, there is evidence that pDCs
can activate Treg cells [123]. Nrp1 appears to have a
functional role in pDCs, because the incubation of these
cells with an anti-Nrp1 antibody (BDCA-4) blocked
IFN-α production induced by viral infection or nucleic
acids [76]. The mechanism has not been elucidated.
Intriguingly, Nrp1 is a receptor for HTLV-1 [52], and
possibly other viruses, and might play an important role in
viral internalization as outlined later in this review. Nrp2
may also be of importance to DCs. Indeed, Rey-Gallardo
et al. [124, 125] have reported that Nrp2 promotes
CCL21-driven chemotaxis and migration of mature DCs.
They observed that polysialic acid, attached to Nrp2a
or Nrp2b, is involved in this chemotactic process. This
suggests a major biologic function for Nrp2, because
DC migration to secondary lymphoid organs is a key
early step in the generation of immune responses, and
occurs predominantly through an interaction of the CCR7
receptor with its chemokine ligands CCL21 and CCL19.

are difficult to pinpoint, because they interact with so
many cancer-associated molecules. Thus, they could
be contributing to cancer cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, adhesiveness and metastasis. Importantly,
they appear to promote EMT and the maintenance of an
immature or cancer stem cell phenotype, as discussed
below. They are also expressed by various stromal cells
that can interact with the tumor cells, including fibroblasts,
endothelial cells and immune cells. For instance, Nrp1 was
reported to bind fibronectin and activate α5β1 integrin, and
to orchestrate interactions between myofibroblasts and
soluble fibronectin [134]. This promoted α5β1 integrindependent fibronectin fibril assembly and increased
matrix stiffness and tumor growth. Indeed, due to their
versatility, it is likely that the neuropilins contribute to
every major step in cancer biology, from tumor initiation
to the generation of metastases.
Of note, Nrp2 is expressed by lymphatic endothelial
cells, at least during development, and may have a
special role in metastasis. It interacts with VEGF-C and
its receptor VEGFR3, which are importantly involved
in lymphangiogenesis [32]. Notably, Caunt et al. [135]
found that an Nrp2 antibody blocked VEGF-C binding
and disrupted VEGF-C-induced lymphatic endothelial cell
migration. Remarkably, in tumor models, this antibody
inhibited tumoral lymphangiogenesis and protected
against metastasis to local lymph nodes or distant sites.
Nrp2 may also increase the expression of metastatic
and anti-apoptotic genes, and increase resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs, possibly through a mechanism
involving β-catenin [136]. Nrp2 has also been linked to
aggressive behavior in prostate cancer [137]. In this case,
VEGF/Nrp2 signaling was reported to suppress IGF-1R
expression, in a mechanism involving Bmi-1. Concurrent
inhibition of Nrp2 and IGF-1R prevented tumor growth
in vivo.
The cancer promoting effects of Nrps have often
been attributed to an enhancement of VEGFR2 activation
in response to VEGF. However, some tumours express
Nrps but neither VEGFR1 nor VEGFR2 and, at least
in these cases, it seems unlikely that VEGF receptors
are involved. The role of semaphorins is complex, but
the evidence suggests that the SEMA3s have primarily
anti-cancer effects [25, 26]. As reviewed above, the
Nrps interact with several GFs (VEGF, TGF-β, HGF
and PDGF) that can all contribute to cancer progression.
These signaling pathways interact extensively, with
numerous potential outcomes (Fig. 1B). Nrps might play
an important role in the regulation or coordination of these
responses, especially as related to interactions between
TGF-β and the other GFs.

Nrp expression and prognosis
Many malignant tumor cell lines express Nrp1
and/or Nrp2, and this appears to contribute to their
aggressiveness [5-11]. Clinically, as previously reviewed
[5-11, 14-16], the neuropilins are frequently overexpressed
in several human tumor types, including carcinomas
(e.g., pancreas, prostate, breast, colon and kidney),
melanoma, glioblastoma, leukemias, lymphomas and
others. In general, Nrp expression correlates with more
aggressive clinical tumor behavior. For instance, in breast
cancer biopsies Nrp1 expression is a feature of high
grade tumours, rather than low grade, and is frequently
expressed by tumours of patients who died from cancer
[130]. Indeed, Nrp1 or Nrp2 expression is significantly
associated with poor survival in breast cancer, independent
of other standard prognostic factors [131, 132].

Does Nrp expression by tumor cells promote
tumor progression?
Although Nrp expression in some types of cancers
has been linked to a poor prognosis, most studies did not
distinguish whether this was due to expression by the
tumor vasculature or the tumor cells. Indeed, as mentioned
previously, although Nrp expression by the vasculature is
very common, in tumor cells it is quite variable from one
tumor to another [15, 16]. Thus, it could be argued that
Nrps are involved only, or mainly, in tumor angiogenesis.
However, there is evidence that expression by tumor cells
is relevant. For instance, Hong et al. [58] showed that
Nrp1 expression was an independent predictor of poor
prognosis in NSCLC. Moreover, they showed that Nrp1
knockdown in lung cancer cell lines reduced their ability
to migrate, invade and form filipodia, and it also inhibited
metastasis. In studies of human colon cancer cell line
xenotransplantation, others demonstrated that the forced
expression of Nrp2 increased tumor growth, whereas the
knockdown of Nrp2 prevented tumor formation [36], or
reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis [133].
Similarly, knockdown of Nrp1 in renal cell carcinoma
cells resulted in poor tumor growth [66]. In mice, the
deletion of Nrp1 in normal epidermis prevented skin
tumor initiation [68]. Our own studies showed that Nrp
knockdown in breast cancer cell lines prevented tumor
sphere formation, which is an in vitro assay for cancer
stem cells (see below). A caveat is that these in vivo
experimental models can only partially duplicate clinical
cancer, and further studies are required to elucidate the
role of Nrps in cancer progression.

TGF-β signaling pathways

and enhances canonical Smad2/3 signaling in response
to this cytokine [34]. Other authors have reported similar
findings in studies of Nrp1 [35] and Nrp2 [36]. In view
of these findings, we hypothesize that Nrp1 plays a key
role on the membrane of cells by capturing active or latent
TGF-β1, activating the latent form, and enhancing TGFβ-receptor signaling. TGF-β is involved in several aspects
of regulatory T-cell biology [116]. Indeed, it promotes
the survival of natural Treg (nTreg) cells, induces the
differentiation of conventional T cells into induced
Treg (iTreg) cells, and acts as an effector molecule for
suppression. However, although Nrp1 has been linked
to Treg function in mice, its role in human Treg cells is
not well established because, as noted previously, only a
subset of activated human Treg cells express Nrp1.	
An interesting question related to cancer biology is
whether TGF-β production by T cells, rather than tumor
cells, is responsible for fostering tumor progression. It
seems likely that both sources of TGF-β production are
important. However, a recent study by Sarkar et al. [143]
suggests that at least in some tumors the production of this
cytokine by T cells is more relevant. In a transgenic model
of mammary cancer, these authors observed that deletion
of TGF-β1 from tumor cells was not protective against
tumor development. In contrast, the ablation of TGF-β1
from T cells inhibited tumor growth, and prevented
tumors from progressing to higher pathological grades and
generating lung metastases. In the tumor environment, we
speculate that Nrps could promote interactions between
T cells and either tumor cells or stromal cells, leading
to enhanced TGF-β1 action with its potential negative
effects.
The expression of LAP on either murine or human
Treg cells has been controversial, but recent studies
clearly show that it is present on activated Treg cells of
both species [117-120]. We identified Nrp1 as a receptor
for LAP, but we observed that LAP is rapidly internalized
following binding [34]. Furthermore, some T cells lacking
Nrp1 express LAP, and it might not the principal receptor
for membrane-attached LAP on Tregs. Indeed, other
authors [117-120] have identified GARP (LRRC32) as the
more likely receptor. GARP is expressed following Treg
activation. It appears to anchor LAP to the membrane by
covalent bonding [121]. GARP may have a functional role
in Treg cells, but this remains unclear. Unlike Nrp1, GARP
does not activate LAP-TGF-β1, but our results suggest the
two molecules might interact in this process.

The three TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1 is the most
important) use the same signaling receptor and it has three
major components [116]: Type I (RI, or ALK5); type II
(RII); and type III (RIII, or betaglycan). RIII binds TGF-β
and recruits TGF-β to RII, which then phosphorylates
RI, to form a heterotetrameric serine/threonine kinase
complex. In turn, RI phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3
(receptor-associated Smads [R-Smads]), and the latter
form a heteromeric complex with Smad4, which
translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA and regulates
transcription. TGF-β receptors also signals through
multiple noncanonical (non-Smad) pathways, including
JNK/p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and Rho-like
GTPases, and there is complex cross-talk between these
pathways [138, 139]. Of particular interest, TRAF6
interactions with the TGF-β receptor complex result in
the activation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which
can in turn activate the JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-κB
pathways [139]. Importantly, the noncanonical pathways
can antagonize canonical signaling, especially by
inhibiting Smad3. For instance, hyperactivation of PI3K/
Akt or ERK1/2 blocks canonical signaling [138, 139,
141]. The balance between canonical and noncanonical
signaling may influence tumor progression. Thus, a shift
from canonical to noncanonical TGF-beta signaling may
increase the likelihood of metastasis in breast cancer, as
recently reviewed [142].

Neuropilins interact with TGF-β1 and its
receptors
TGF-β is quite commonly produced by tumors, and
it plays an important and complex role in cancer. In early
neoplastic lesions, TGF-β exerts a tumor suppressor effect,
whereas at advanced stages it has a negative impact [116].
This is sometimes referred to as the TGF-β paradox, and
it remains poorly understood. Indeed, in advanced disease
it promotes metastasis and inhibits anti-tumor immunity
[116]. A role for Nrps in modulating the response to
TGF-β1 is supported by our observations that Nrp1 and
Nrp2 are able to bind both active TGF-β1 and LAPTGF-β1 (latent form) [33, 34]. Interestingly, free LAP,
LAP-TGF-β1, and TGF-β1 all competed with VEGF165
for binding to Nrp1, suggesting that they bind at (or near)
the same site. However, Nrp1 appears to have more than
one binding site for LAP. We found that Nrp1+ T cells
and cancer cells have an increased ability to capture LAPTGF-β1. Conventional CD4+ T (lacking Nrp1) acquired
strong Treg activity when coated with Nrp1-Fc and LAPTGF-β1. Moreover, LAP-TGF-β1 was activated by Nrp1,
as discussed in another section below.
Furthermore, we found that both Nrp1 and Nrp2
interact with the signaling TGF-β receptors (RI and RII)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Nrp1 and the activation of latent TGF-β on the
cell membrane
TGF-β is usually secreted as a large latent complex
(LLC) consisting of LAP-TGF-β (the small latent
complex) that is covalently attached to a single molecule
of latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP) [116, 121]. LAP
928

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 921-939

and TGF-β are not covalently bound and during activation
mature TGF-β is released totally or partially, such that it
can bind to the signaling TGF-β receptors. Activation is
a key factor in regulating the response to TGF-β [126129]. Cell surface molecules that capture latent TGFbeta include the RGD-binding integrins (notably the αV
subfamily), Nrp1 and GARP. The integrins bind the RGD
motif of LAP [126-129], and some can activate TGF-β.
In vivo, activation is thought to occur by one of two
mechanisms. Some integrins, typified by αVβ6, bind the
LAP-RGD site and, concurrently, to ECM components
(such as fibrillin and fibronectin) through LTBP. It appears
that traction forces induce conformational changes in LAP,
and release mature TGF-β. Alternatively, as typified by
αVβ8, activation is effected by MMP enzymes. However,
because LAP has both an integrin-binding site (RGD)
and neuropilin binding sites, we hypothesize there is a
third mechanism where Nrp1 or Nrp2 contribute to the
activation of latent TGF-β after it binds to an integrin.
This is consistent with our recent observations that Nrp1
can activate latent TGF-β1 after it attaches to either
αvβ3 integrin or another receptor (GARP) [34]. This
type of interaction would be particularly relevant on the
membrane of cancer cells, which frequently co-express
RGD-binding integrins and neuropilins. It remains unclear
how Nrp1 activates TGF-β1; however, Nrp1 and Nrp2
bear a b2 domain motif (RKFK) that we found capable of
activating LAP-TGF-β1, at least in soluble peptide form
[33]. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the sequence
94
RKPK of TGF-β1 binds to LAP and, in soluble form,
the RKPK peptide activates LAP-TGF-β1 [127]. This
peptide is closely similar to the peptides of Nrp1 (RKFK)
and thrombospondin -1 (KRFK) [33, 127] that also
activate LAP-TGF-β1. It may be that these basic peptides
compete with TGF-β1 for binding to LAP, and/or induce a
conformational change in LAP, and this releases (partially
or completely) mature TGF-β1, which can then exert its
actions.

p130Cas mutant, all reduced the GF-induced migration
of endothelial cells and glioma cells [45]. The integrin
adaptor molecule p130Cas has a large interactome.
Phosphorylation of p130Cas is usually mediated by Src
and FAK [145] and, interestingly, TGF-β can activate Src/
FAK [141]. However, Nrp1 appears to bypass the Src/FAK
pathway [44, 45]. Phospho-p130Cas is involved in the
formation of a molecular complex at the cell membrane
(DOCK1). This activates multiple pathways and stimulates
cell proliferation, migration, survival, and invasion [145].
p130Cas contributes to transformation induced by several
oncogenes (e.g., HER2, ALK, KRAS, and BRAF) [145].
In ER+ breast cancers, p130Cas is associated with disease
progression and resistance to tamoxifen [146]; hence, the
alternative name of breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance
1 (BCAR1).
This is particularly relevant to TGF-β action
in cancer, because p130Cas has been shown to block
canonical TGF-β signaling by acting on Smad3 [147,
148], whereas it increases noncanonical signaling [148].
Indeed, Wendt et al. [148] proposed that p130Cas alters
the balance between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β
signaling, in a way that impairs the tumor suppressor
functions of TGF-β during breast cancer progression.
This leads to the hypothesis that Nrps might modify
the response to TGF-β in a context dependent manner
(canonical vs. noncanonical), as influenced by the
presence of other GFs. Thus, the tumor suppressor effects
of TGF-β might depend largely on the Smad canonical
pathway and dominate when the levels of other GFs are
low, while the pro-metastatic effects might depend mostly
on the noncanonical pathways and predominate when the
levels of other GFs are high. In Figure 1B, we present a
hypothetical model of how these pathways might interact.

CANCER STEM CELLS (CSCS)
CSCs have several key features, as we have
recently reviewed [70]. They express markers allowing
purification, and are highly tumourigenic as compared
to other tumor subsets. Other notable features include
the capacity to form tumour spheres in low-adherence
cultures, self-renewal, and multi-drug resistance. CSCs
also express high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1
(ALDHhi ), as detected by the Aldefluor reaction. For
instance, human breast CSCs have been reported to be
CD44+, CD24-/low, ESA+, ALDHhi, highly tumourigenic,
and responsive to TGF-β. From a clinical point of view,
drug resistance is probably the most important feature.
Indeed, CSCs are drug resistant and can be enriched from
cancer cell lines by culture with chemotherapeutic agents
(e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone) [70, 149].

Potential signaling activities of the Nrps
The signaling functions of the Nrps have been
unclear. Interactions with the PDZ protein synectin
are thought to be important, but this remains poorly
understood [13]. In fact, synectin gene knockout produces
a mild phenotype, compared to the lethal phenotype
of Nrp1 knockout [144]. In view of this, the role of
synectin requires some clarification. However, recent
studies [44, 45] show that Nrp1 contributes to p130Cas
phosphorylation, downstream signaling and increased cell
motility in response to either VEGF, HGF or PDGF. This
is dependent on the cytoplasmic segment of Nrp1, but
apparently not on synectin, suggesting there is some other
as yet unknown signaling machinery. Knockdown of either
Nrp1 or p130Cas, or alternatively expression of either
Nrp1 without its cytoplasmic domain or a non-functional

signal transduction between activated Smoothened (Smo)
protein and the negative regulator Suppressor of Fused
(SuFu).  Similarly, Cao et al. [66] observed in a renal
carcinoma model that Nrp1 knockdown resulted in a more
differentiated phenotype and the inhibition of sonic Hh.
They concluded that Nrp1 promotes an undifferentiated
phenotype in cancer cells.

VEGF appears to be important for the self-renewal,
survival and tumor-forming ability of CSCs. These cells
can secrete VEGF, which initiates an autocrine stimulatory
loop that is dependent on both VEGFR2 and Nrp. Beck
et al. [68] recently reported that VEGF affects skin tumor
growth by promoting cancer stemness and CSC expansion.
The deletion of Nrp1 in cutaneous CSCs blocked this
ability. Similarly, Hamerlick et al. [69] found that
VEGF-VEGFR2-Nrp1 signaling promotes glioblastoma
CSC-like cell (CD133+) viability and tumor growth.
In some glioblastoma CSCs, they observed VEGFR2Nrp1 recycling and a pool of active VEGFR2 within a
cytosolic compartment, which they postulate contributes
to the resistance of these cells to anti-VEGF therapy with
bevacizumab.

Nrps and EMT
Nrp1 enhances signaling in three major pathways
that have been linked to EMT, i.e., TGF-β, Hh and HGF/
cMet. TGF-β plays a major role in EMT by regulating
the expression of multiple genes and pathways, as
recently reviewed by Fuxe et al. [153].  Thus, TGF-βinduced pathways interact with stem cell pathways such
as Wnt, Ras, Hedgehog and Notch to produce EMT. In
this process, EMT-associated transcription factors (e.g.,
Snail1, Zeb1/2, Twist, β-catenin) interact with Smads to
form complexes that regulate the expression of epithelial
and mesenchymal genes. Other pathways and miRNAs
are also involved. For example, Cesi et al. [154] showed
that TGF-β increases the expression of c-Myb in ER+
breast cancer cells by a number of mechanisms, including
alterations in miRNA expression. This increase in c-Myb
was required to induce the expression of EMT-associated
markers, in vitro invasion and anchorage-independent
growth. Integrins also appear to play an important role.
Interestingly, Bianchi et al. [155] found that the depletion
of αv-integrin or β5-integrin blocked TGF-β-induced
EMT. They showed that β5-integrin adhesions contributed
to the TGF-β-induced EMT and the tumorigenic potential
of carcinoma cells. Because Nrps bind some integrins
(Table 1), we hypothesize that Nrp/integrin complexes can
form and contribute to the induction of EMT and tumor
progression. Nrp interactions with PDGFs might also be
relevant to EMT. Nrp1 enhances responses to PDGF-A or
PDGF-B [42], and these mediators are involved in EMT
[156, 157]. However, it is unknown whether Nrps interact
with PDGF-C that has homology to the CUB (a1/a2)
domains of Nrp1 [158] and induces VEGF-independent
angiogenesis [159] and possibly EMT, or with PDGF-D
that potently induces EMT [160].
Interestingly, Grandclement et al. [11, 36] identified
an important function for Nrp2 in promoting EMT.
In accord with our work, they showed that Nrp2 is a
coreceptor for TGF-β1 and promotes Smad-dependent
signaling. Indeed, Nrp2 induced EMT in a TGF-β1dependent fashion [36]. Moreover, as mentioned
previously, they showed that Nrp2 markedly enhances
tumor formation in a colon cancer xenografts model.
Importantly, the expression of Nrp2 was linked to
constitutive canonical signaling in the TGF-β pathway.
Our unpublished data suggest that Nrp1 also promotes
EMT. In this respect, the studies of Mani and colleagues
[161] showing that the induction of EMT in breast

NF-κB and Hedgehog (Hh) pathways in CSCs
Nrp1 and/or Nrp2 are expressed by some stem or
progenitor cells [150, 151], and breast CSCs [152]. We
have studied tranilast as a drug that inhibits breast CSCs
by acting on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor [70, 149].
Recently, we found that tranilast markedly suppresses
Nrp1 expression and NF-κB activation in breast cancer
cells [152]. To examine this further, we knocked down
Nrps in breast cancer cell lines with siRNA, and found
this prevented tumor sphere (mammosphere) formation,
which is an in vitro assay for breast CSCs, and abrogated
constitutive NF-κB activation [152]. This is of particular
interest because the NF-κB pathway contributes to
mammosphere formation, and the tumorigenicity of CSCs.
Our studies suggest that Nrp1 plays an important role in
breast CSCs, especially as related to NF-κB activation, but
the mechanisms by which it exerts these effects remain to
be elucidated.
The Hh pathway is involved in key aspects of
development and the maintenance of the stem cell
phenotype. In this role it interacts with several other
pathways regulating development, such as Wnt/β-catenin,
Notch, and TGF-β. These pathways also interact in the
process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
which is highly important in development, wound healing
and cancer. Reactivation of the Hh pathway has been
linked to cancer progression, more aggressive tumor
phenotypes and metastasis. The work of Hillman et al. [67]
points to Nrp1 and Nrp2 as major regulatory components
of the Hh pathway. These authors demonstrated that
Nrps are expressed at similar times and locations as
Hh during development. Moreover, Nrp1 transcription
was induced by Hh signaling, and Nrp1 overexpression
increased Hh target gene activation, suggesting a positive
feedback circuit. With cell lines lacking Hh pathway
components, they demonstrated that Nrps mediate Hh

epithelial cells produces CSC-like cells represent a major
advance. This demonstrates an inducible program that
promotes cancer progression, and that might be amenable
to therapy. Taken together, these findings suggest that Nrps
contribute to EMT, which has been associated with a CSC
phenotype and aggressive tumor behavior.

Nrp1 had only a minor effect on VEGFR2 signaling
showing that some Nrp and VEGFR2 functions can be
dissociated, as recently reviewed by Zachary [13].
Nrp2 has been more closely linked to metastasis
than Nrp1 and, therefore, represents a key target. Indeed,
an antibody binding the VEGF bindings of Nrp2 (antiNRP2B) has been developed, and found to inhibit tumour
lymphatic development and prevent metastasis [135].
Since Nrp1 and Nrp2 have similar but not completely
overlapping roles in angiogenesis and cancer, it might be
desirable to therapeutically block both. These approaches
involving Nrp blockade clearly have merit, but there are
also some potential drawbacks. Nrp1 and/or Nrp2 are
expressed by endothelial cells throughout the vascular
system (arteries, veins and lymphatics), as well as several
other cell types, and therapies targeting these cells
may have adverse effects. There is currently very little
information on this subject, but a phase I clinical trial
(Genentech, Inc.) with the human anti-NRP1 antibody
MNRP1685A resulted in transient platelet depletion [165].
Furthermore, analysis of the safety profile of this antibody
when combined with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody),
with or without paclitaxel, revealed a high incidence of
proteinuria [166]. Thus, although anti-Nrp1 therapy
may not be markedly toxic on its own, it may produce
important adverse effects when combined with some anticancer agents.

NRP1 AND NRP2 AS TARGETS FOR
CANCER THERAPY
There is great interest in targeting Nrps for cancer
therapy, and various approaches have been advocated.
Most of these therapies have been reviewed by others
in recent years [5-11]. One of the earliest approaches
involved the administration of soluble Nrp1 variants to
act as a VEGF trap, and this showed some anti-cancer
therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, it is
likely that other growth factors were also blocked, but this
has not been examined. Other approaches include Nrp
blockade with antibodies or peptides, or knockdown with
siRNA or shRNA. For example, peptides can compete
with VEGF for binding to Nrp1 [53-62]. In some studies,
Nrp1-binding peptides or knockdown of Nrp1 by siRNA
inhibited cancer cell growth and increased the sensitivity
of the cells to chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 5-FU,
paclitaxel, and cisplatin) [61]. Of note, Nrp1 may be a
useful target for therapy in glioblastoma [162], melanoma
[163] and some forms of leukemia [62].
The b1-domain binding site for the C-terminal motif
of VEGF has been very well defined by crystallographic
studies. This facilitates the design of small drugs that
fit into this site, to block VEGF binding. These drugs
would likely also block other ligands that are dependent
on that binding site. Jarvis et al. [164] recently reported
on the molecular design of such a small molecule ligand
(EG00229). This drug inhibited VEGF-A binding to
NRP1, and reduced the viability of A549 lung carcinoma
cells. Remarkably, it also increased the potency of the anticancer cytotoxic agents paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil. The
clinical availability of small drugs of this kind, especially
if orally active, would represent a major advance in the
area of Nrp-targeted therapy.
It is of particular interest that combined anti-VEGF
and anti-Nrp1 therapy with monoclonal antibodies was
synergistic in mouse models of cancer [104]. Since the
SEMA3s appear to exert primarily anti-cancer effects
whereas the VEGFs tend to promote cancer, it could be
beneficial to block only VEGF binding. This might be
possible with specific antibodies or peptides. Genentech
has developed antibodies against the SEMA3 binding “a”
region (anti-Nrp1A) or VEGF binding “b” region (antiNrp1B) [104]. However, these two antibodies had similar
effects on reducing angiogenesis and vascular remodeling
[104]. The reason is unclear, although we speculate that
both antibodies induce endocytosis of Nrp1, and hence
have a similar therapeutic activity. Interestingly, blocking
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Nrp1 and the C-end rule
A recent finding is that peptides that bind to Nrp1
are quickly internalized. Since cancer cells frequently
express Nrp1, it could be a target permitting internalization
of many drugs into these cells. This would be particularly
useful in the case of large drugs that cannot cross the
membrane. Teesalu et al. [53] screened a phage peptide
library with the goal of identifying cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs). They observed that many CPPs in their
library bound to Nrp1 and had a C-terminal consensus R/
XXR/K motif, preferentially with a C-terminal arginine
K
(R) although occasionally lysine (K). These peptides
appear to bind to the electronegative pocket of the b1
domain of Nrp1, as noted previously for the C-terminal
motif of VEGF. These authors denoted this binding
pattern the C-end rule (CendR). Of importance for
cancer therapy, Sugahara et al. [54, 55] described tumorhoming cyclic peptides designated iRGD (CRGDK/RGPD/
C), which attached to RGD-binding integrins through
E
their RGD motif. They reported that these peptides were
cleaved on the membrane of tumor cells by a furin-like
protease, and this exposed a CendR motif (RGDK/R)
that could bind to Nrp1. Importantly, attachment of this
peptide to Nrp1 resulted in peptide/Nrp1 internalization,
along with peptide-linked cargo. The precise mechanism
of internalization has not been elucidated. Furthermore,
the iRGD peptides induced vascular leakage and allowed
931

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 921-939

extensive tissue penetration of the peptide and attached
cargo, especially in tumors. Drugs coinjected with a
CendR peptide also showed increased penetration into
tumors, presumably due to increased vascular permeability
[55]. Subsequent studies have shown that an RGD motif is
not always required for the homing of CendR peptides to
tumors, and that Nrp2 can also internalize peptides through
the CendR pathway [167]. These findings are interesting,
but the importance of CendR peptides in cancer therapy
remains to be established, especially as to their specificity
and safety.
It is also interesting to note that many proteins have
a CendR motif, which is either constantly exposed (e.g.,
VEGF and LAP-β1), or exposed following enzymatic
cleavage on the cell membrane (e.g., viral capsid proteins)
[53-57]. For instance, we observed that LAP-β1 (RHRR
CendR motif) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells
after it binds to Nrp1 [33]. Due to this cell-penetrating
ability, CendR motifs are likely of biological importance
in several situations, such as internalization of bacterial
toxins [53] and infection with some viruses such as HTLV1 [168]. Some animal toxins also have a CendR motif,
such as the cell-penetrating Imperatoxin A of scorpions
[169], and this might be relevant to their toxicity but it
remains to be examined.

174]. In the immune system, the Nrps are expressed
mainly by DCs and Tregs, and have been linked chiefly
to inhibitory effects. This may depend on Nrp-mediated
T-cell/DC interactions or the capture and activation of
latent TGF-β, and these mechanisms are not mutually
exclusive. Inhibition may also be mediated by SEMA3A,
as suggested by some studies. At any rate, conditional
Nrp1 knockout in murine T cells results in poor Treg
function and increased autoimmunity. This suppressive
role of Nrp1 is particularly relevant to cancer, where it
could block anti-tumor immunity.
In cancer, Nrp expression has frequently been linked
to a poor prognosis. This may be due to increased tumor
angiogenesis, but it is clear that Nrps mediate other tumor
promoting effects. For instance, Nrp1 promotes TGF-β,
NF-κB and Hedgehog signaling, EMT and CSC survival.
Nrp2 expression by tumor cells and lymphatic endothelial
cells has been linked to metastasis. Importantly, Nrps
appear to activate pathways that protect tumor cells
against apoptosis and cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs. The
identification of CendR peptides that penetrate the cell
membrane by binding to Nrp1 is of major therapeutic
interest. These peptides (or larger proteins with a CendR
C-terminal motif) have considerable cell- and tissuepenetrating ability. Thus, they can be coupled to drugs
(cargo), especially large drugs, which do not normally
penetrate the cell membrane. All these features point to
Nrps as important targets for cancer therapy. This can be
accomplished by several methods, as reviewed above, but
almost all these studies have been preclinical, and much
more research is needed to translate these findings into
clinically applicable therapies.

CONCLUSIONS
The Nrps are versatile proteins interacting with
numerous ligands and involved in cardiovascular and
nervous system embryonic development, as well as
post-natal angiogenesis, immunity and cancer. Their
interactions with SEMA3 and VEGF soluble ligands
and their receptors have been extensively studied.
Despite this, the actual molecular mechanisms of action
of Nrps remain poorly understood, especially as related
to signaling. The recent identification of several other
ligands such as TGF-β, HGF and PDGF has raised even
more questions. Interestingly, a general pattern has been
that Nrps interact with both the soluble ligands and their
classic signaling receptors. Furthermore, these ligands
are involved in orchestrating angiogenesis in various
functions, including VEGFs, TGF-β, HGF and PDGF.
The Nrps are not absolutely required for signaling in these
pathways, but they usually boost or alter the response. We
can hypothesize that Nrps play some role in capturing the
ligands, regulating GF receptor expression, endocytosis
and recycling, or possibly signaling independently. In
the case of the SEMA3s, except for SEMA3E, Nrps are
essential for activating the plexin receptors, and these
SEMA3/Nrp/Plexin interactions frequently antagonize
VEGF-induced stimulation, especially as related to
angiogenesis and cancer. Although SEMA3s were not
a major focus of this review, their importance in tumor
biology is considerable and their action is complex,
as detailed in reviews by other authors [7, 25, 26, 170www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
