ABSTRACT
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients commonly present with advanced
stage disease and demonstrate resistance to therapy, with response rates below 40%.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance is crucial for improvement of
clinical outcomes. IGFBP2 is a member of the IGFBP family of proteins that has been
reported to modulate both IGF and integrin signaling and is a mediator of cell growth,
invasion and resistance in other tumor types. In this study, high IGFBP2 expression was
observed in a subset of primary EACs and was found to be significantly higher in patients
with shorter disease-free intervals as well as in treatment-resistant EACs as compared
to chemonaive EACs. Modulation of IGFBP2 expression in EAC cell lines promoted cell
proliferation, migration and invasion, implicating a role in the metastatic potential of
these cells. Additionally, knockdown of IGFBP2 sensitized EAC cells to cisplatin in a
serum-dependent manner. Further in vitro exploration into this chemosensitization
implicated both the AKT and ERK pathways. Silencing of IGFBP2 enhanced IGF1-induced
immediate activation of AKT and reduced cisplatin-induced ERK activation. Addition of
MEK1/2 (selumetinib or trametinib) or AKT (AKT Inhibitor VIII) inhibitors enhanced
siIGFBP2-induced sensitization of EAC cells to cisplatin. These results suggest that
targeted inhibition of IGFBP2 alone or together with either the MAPK or PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway in IGFBP2-overexpressing EAC tumors may be an effective approach
for sensitizing resistant EACs to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

(those patients who are restaged as T0N0 or T1N0) have
improved survival as compared to incomplete or nonresponders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for
chemoresistance is crucial in order to identify strategies to
address such resistance, and thus improve clinical outcome.
The insulin growth factor-1 (IGF1) and IGF1
receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway, implicated in
esophageal cancer growth and progression, has been
shown to play pivotal roles in cell growth, differentiation,
survival, transformation and metastasis [6–9]. Over­
expression of IGF1R is prevalent in esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC), as high as 75% [10], and has
been associated with the progression of Barrett’s to EAC
[8]. Overexpression of IGF1R also appears to be an
independent predictor of survival [10]. Serum IGF-1 level

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has
been increasing steadily in industrialized countries over
the past four decades and continues to rise [1]. Despite
advances in endoscopic surveillance and multimodality
treatment regimens, the prognosis for EAC patients
remains poor, with an overall 5-year relative survival
rate of less than 20% [2]. While understanding of the
progression from Barrett’s esophagus to EAC has
improved, patients commonly present with advanced
stage disease and demonstrate resistance to conventional
therapy, with complete response rates to trimodality
therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy and esophageal
resection) below 40% [3–5]. Only complete responders

correlates with pathological stage, depth of invasion and
prognosis in esophageal cancer patients [11]. Additionally,
Doyle et al. (2011) reported a dose-dependent increase
in proliferation in response to IGF1 in EAC cells and
significantly higher serum IGF1 levels in EAC patients
compared to those with Barrett’s esophagus or controls
[12]. Function-altering polymorphisms in IGF1R [13]
as well as IGF1 microsatellite repeats and single strand
nucleotide polymorphisms [14, 15] have been shown to
affect risk for developing Barrett’s esophagus and/or EAC.
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 2
(IGFBP2) is a member of the IGFBP family of proteins
that binds both IGF1 and IGF2 in circulation with higher
affinity than ligand-receptor interactions and can inhibit
or stimulate the growth-promoting effects of IGFs by
altering their bioavailability, distribution, stability and/
or interactions with cell surface receptors [6, 16–18].
IGFBP2 also contains arginine-glycine-aspartic acid
(RGD) and heparin-binding motifs that bind to integrins
and extracellular matrix, respectively, to mediate its role in
cell detachment, migration and invasion [17–21].
Increased IGFBP2 expression has been reported in
many malignancies and has been linked to chemoresistance
in ovarian cancer [22], breast cancer [23–25], colon
cancer [26], lung cancer [27–29], prostate cancer [30, 31],
glioma [32–34] and leukemia [35–37]. It has been shown
to be a key player in the development and progression of
both glioma [32] and prostate cancer [30]. Inhibition of
its expression has been reported to increase apoptosis and
decrease migration of human leukemia cells [35], while its
overexpression significantly increased the invasive capability
of glioblastoma [33, 34] and ovarian cancer cells [38].
Because IGFBP2 has been shown to modulate both
the IGF and integrin pathways and is a mediator of cell
growth, invasion, and resistance in other tumor types [22–
37, 39, 40], we evaluated the functional role of IGFBP2
in EAC progression and chemoresistance. We show that
modulation of IGFBP2 expression affects proliferation,
motility, and chemosensitization of EAC cells in a serumdependent manner. Silencing of IGFBP2 affects both AKT
and ERK activity and addition of targeted pharmacologic
inhibitors of these pathways enhances siIGFBP2-induced
cisplatin (CDDP) chemosensitization. IGFBP2 is a
potential mediator of chemoresistance in a subset of EACs
and its modulation in overexpressing EAC tumors may
be an effective approach to sensitizing resistant tumors to
standard of care chemotherapy.

examined by Affymetrix HG-U133A oligonucleotide
microarray (Figure 1A). Although many EACs expressed
very low levels of IGFBP2, a subset of primary tumors
expressed higher levels of IGFBP2. Expression values
for this cohort were confirmed by qRT-PCR (R2 = 0.80)
(Supplementary Figure S1A). We analyzed the association
between IGFBP2 expression and stage, node status or
differentiation. None of these clinical parameters were
associated with IGFBP2 expression (p = 1.00, 1.00 or
0.57, respectively, using Fisher’s exact test). Immunoblot
analysis of protein extracts from 5 paired samples of
esophageal adenocarcinoma and associated Barrett’s
metaplasia indicated increased expression in three of
five tumor samples and decreased expression in one
of five tumor samples relative to Barrett’s metaplasia
(Figure 1B). Variable IGFBP2 protein expression was
observed among the EAC tissue samples and correlated
highly with IGFBP2 tissue mRNA expression, as noted
by both oligonucleotide microarray and qRT-PCR.
Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays confirmed
variable levels of IGFBP2 expression in EACs, ranging
from undetectable to high expression at the brush border
of several patient sections (Figure 1C). Expression was
detected in approximately 23% of tumors but did not
correlate with pathologic tumor stage.
Affymetrix HG-U133A oligonucleotide microarray
analysis of a second cohort of twenty EACs, obtained
from esophagectomy patients who subsequently received
chemotherapy, identified IGFBP2 as one of the genes
with lower expression among disease-free patients as
compared to patients with recurrent disease (Figure 2A).
Expression levels for this cohort were confirmed by qRTPCR (R2 = 0.80) (Supplementary Figure S1B). In this
cohort, patients with higher IGFBP2 expression had worse
overall survival, even when controlled for cancer stage (p
= 0.033, log rank test) (Figure 2B). Multivariable Cox
analyses were performed for stage, node positivity and
differentiation. Stage and node positivity were correlated
(concordance = 0.703, R2 = 0.292), and both of these
variables were significantly correlated to overall survival
(p = 0.014 and 0.0317, respectively). There was no
concordance between stage and IGFBP2 expression, and
the IGFBP2 correlation to overall survival was stronger
than stage (p = 0.0069). Differentiation was not significant
due to lack of power (only 8 of 20 samples had known
differentiation status).
To address the hypothesis that IGFBP2 is involved
in chemoresistance, we performed real-time PCR on 200
EAC samples obtained from previously untreated patients
(“chemonaïve”) and 16 treatment-resistant EAC samples
to compare their levels of IGFBP2 expression relative to
Barrett’s esophagus and normalized to GAPDH. Baseline
clinical data on all subjects included in this study are provided
in Table 1, and chemoradiation therapy regimens for treated
patients are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. Although
there was considerable variability within the two groups,

IGFBP2 expression was significantly higher in resistant
EACs as determined by nonparametric Mann-Whitney
analysis (p = 0.0097) (Figure 2C). A categorical binary
analysis was also performed using a 1.5-fold threshold,
which would be equivalent to a 2-fold change assuming
approximately 70% tumor content for each tissue analyzed.
Expression of IGFBP2 differed significantly between
untreated and treated samples (p = 0.006).

conditions. In contrast to what has been previously
reported [12], OE19 cells did not significantly respond to
IGF1 in the presence or absence of serum (Supplementary
Figure S3C), emphasizing its self-sufficiency in growth
signaling. Additionally, the proliferative response to
exogenous IGF1 was blunted in Flo-1 cells treated with
siRNA to IGFBP2 in the absence of serum (data not
shown), suggesting that IGFBP2 may potentiate IGF1dependent proliferation in these cells.
Treatment with siIGFBP2 alone reduced proliferation
of Flo-1 cells in serum-free conditions, suggesting an IGFindependent role of IGFBP2 in the proliferation of these
cells. In most instances, this IGFBP2 effect was seen
in the presence or absence of IGFs, but addition of IGFs
also enhanced this reduction, possibly due to increased
proliferation in IGFBP2-expressing controls. This inhibitory
effect of IGFBP2 knockdown was not consistently observed
in serum-replete conditions, suggesting that IGFBP2
may have differential roles or significance based on the
availability of additional growth factors.
An IGFBP2 expression construct was transfected
into OE33 EAC cells with baseline endogenous IGFBP2
expression and stable cells derived from single cell clones
were selected for their increased IGFBP2 expression
levels (Supplementary Figure S4A). Differential clonal
proliferation was observed among the individual OE33/
IGFBP2 cells, independent of their IGFBP2 expression
levels (Supplementary Figure S4B), indicating that
these increased levels of IGFBP2 expression were not
responsible for the altered proliferative potential and that
an inherent heterogeneity exists in OE33 cells. We did,
however, observe a statistically significant proliferative
advantage for OE33 cells treated with exogenous human
recombinant IGFBP2 in an IGF1-dependent manner in
serum-replete conditions. This effect was not observed in
serum-free cultures (Supplementary Figure S4C).

IGFBP2 expression in EAC cell lines
The three EAC cell lines Flo-1, OE19 and OE33
were utilized in functional assays to investigate the role
of IGFBP2 in EAC tumorigenesis and chemoresistance.
Real-time PCR analysis of the EAC cell lines Flo-1,
OE19 and OE33 revealed high IGFBP2 expression in
Flo-1 cells but minimal expression in OE19 and OE33
cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Although IGFBP2
protein expression was consistent with the levels of
IGFBP2 mRNA expression in Flo-1 and OE33, OE19
cells expressed relatively high levels of IGFBP2
protein, suggesting a potential post-transcriptional or
post-translational modification to stabilize the protein
(Supplementary Figure S2B).

Effect of IGF1 and IGFBP2 on proliferation of
EAC cells
Since IGFBP2 may rely on its interaction with
IGFs to exact its role in chemoresistance, we evaluated
the proliferative effects of exogenous human recombinant
IGFs in EAC cell lines. IGF1 promoted dose-dependent
growth in Flo-1 and OE33 cells in serum-free conditions
but had little to no effect in serum-replete conditions
(Supplementary Figure S3A & S3B), suggesting that the
proliferative impact of IGF1 is masked in serum-replete

Correlation of IGFBP2 and EMT-related
gene expression

Acute 24 hr treatments with high doses of CDDP
following IGFBP2 knockdown were also performed. In
contrast to 3-day low-dose CDDP treatments, siIGFBP2treated Flo-1 cells were only slightly sensitized to
CDDP (Supplementary Figure S7A), suggesting that the
chemosensitization effect of IGFBP2 knockdown may be
dependent on its modulation of proliferation and would
require longer incubation periods to detect differences.
Neither stable overexpression of IGFBP2 (Supplementary
Figure S7B) nor exogenous IGFBP2 (Supplementary
Figure S7C) altered the chemotherapy sensitivity of OE33
cells, suggesting that this ERBB2-amplified [45] cell line is
not dependent on IGFBP2 expression for cell survival. The
chemosensitization effect of knocking down IGFBP2 was
also examined in endogenously-expressing OE19 cells.
This more CDDP-resistant EAC cell line also has ERBB2
amplification [45] and was not as responsive to siIGFBP2
treatment as Flo-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S7D),
suggesting that IGFBP2 is not a driver of chemoresistance
in these cells.

SiRNA knockdown of IGFBP2 in Flo-1 was
associated with increased expression of several epithelialmesenchymal transition-related genes, including SNAI1,
ZEB1, VIM, MMP9, and MMP1 (Supplementary Figure
S5A). Treatment with CDDP resulted in a marked increase
in SNAI1, SNAI2 and FN1 expression while CDH1 and
VIM expression decreased (Supplementary Figure S5B).
CDH1 levels decreased while CDH2 levels increased in
siIGFBP2/CDDP-treated Flo-1 cells as compared to mocktreated or siNon-targeting controls (Supplementary Figure
S5C), indicating an “E-cadherin to N-cadherin switch”
that has been previously shown to contribute to tumor
cell motility and invasion [41, 42]. Expression of MMP1,
MMP9 and SNAI1 was higher in siIGFBP2-treated cells as
compared to the non-targeting siRNA control, suggesting a
potential relationship between IGFBP2 and these genes in
CDDP-treated cells (Supplementary Figure S5B).

IGFBP2-mediated migratory and invasive
capacity of EAC cells

IGFBP2-dependent effects of IGF1 on ERK
and AKT activation

To determine the role of IGFBP2 in EAC cell
motility, we used siIGFBP2-treated Flo-1 cells and IGFBP2
stably-transfected OE33 cells in wound healing assays.
IGFBP2-expressing OE33 stable cells migrated further
than empty vector controls by 8 hours post-wound and
fully closed the wound by 20 hours (Supplementary Figure
S6A). Conversely, Flo-1 cells treated with siIGFBP2
appeared to migrate into the wound more slowly than the
non-targeting siRNA control (Supplementary Figure S6B).
Boyden chamber assays using IGFBP2-expressing Flo-1
cells showed only marginal Matrigel invasion differences
upon knockdown of IGFBP2 (Supplementary Figure S6C).
These subtle differences suggest that although IGFBP2
might not be the driver gene for metastasis, this protein
does contribute to EAC cell migration and invasion.

IGFBP2 has been shown to stimulate PI3K and
MAPK activity in transformed cells by both IGFdependent and IGF-independent mechanisms [19, 23, 32,
33, 35, 46]. To further explore the mechanism of IGFBP2induced chemoresistance, we assessed whether inhibition
of IGFBP2 could modulate IGF1-induced ERK and/or
AKT activation (Figure 4A). Addition of recombinant
IGF1 only transiently activated ERK and this activation
at 15 minutes was attenuated by siIGFBP2 treatment.
IGF1 inhibited ERK activation at 1 hour in an IGFBP2independent manner. In contrast, AKT was significantly
activated by exogenous IGF1 or IGFBP2 knockdown at
each measured time point as compared to the non-targeting
siRNA control. SiIGFBP2-induced AKT activation was
further enhanced by the addition of IGF1.

Role of IGFBP2 in chemoresistance in vitro

Effects of chemotherapy on IGFBP2
and its effectors

In order to evaluate the role of IGFBP2 as a potential
modulator of chemoresistance in vitro, IGFBP2-expressing
Flo-1 cells were pretreated with siRNA to IGFBP2 while
baseline IGFBP2-expressing OE33 cells were transfected
with a pEGFP-IGFBP2 expression construct followed
by a 3-day treatment with low doses of CDDP or 5-FU.
The dose ranges utilized in these assays were clinically
relevant as determined by previously reported achievable
in vivo drug plasma concentrations [43, 44]. Inhibition of
IGFBP2 expression sensitized Flo-1 cells to CDDP but not
5-FU in serum-replete conditions (Figure 3A). Addition
of either exogenous IGF1 or IGF2 did not appreciably
alter this effect (Figure 3B). In serum-free cell cultures,
IGFBP2 knockdown did not enhance the response to
chemotherapy.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To better understand the role of IGFBP2 in
chemoresistance, we examined the effects of CDDP
and 5-FU treatment alone on IGFBP2 and these critical
signaling pathways. All three EAC cell lines used in this
study were sensitive to CDDP. In Flo-1 cells, short-term
treatment with higher doses and longer-term treatment
with lower doses of CDDP or 5-FU both resulted in
decreased levels of IGFBP2 (Figure 4B). OE33 cells
were more sensitive to 3-day treatment with CDDP and
also expressed much lower levels of IGFBP2 than Flo-1
cells (Figure 4B). Interestingly, in both Flo-1 and OE33
cell cultures, cells surviving repeated acute IC90 CDDP
treatments had decreased expression of IGFBP2 (data

treatment. In contrast to Flo-1 and OE33 cells, IGFBP2
mRNA expression levels in OE19 cells increased from
lower baseline levels following repeated acute IC90 CDDP
treatments (data not shown), while no difference in protein
levels were detected when cells were treated with lower
doses of CDDP for 3 days (Supplementary Figure S8).
These data suggest that these 3 patient-derived EAC cell
lines may utilize different mechanisms when developing
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as CDDP.
Treatment of both Flo-1 and OE33 cells with high
doses of CDDP for 24 hrs led to dose-dependent ERK
activation, with much higher levels observed in OE33
cells. Treatment with 5-FU at higher doses dramatically
induced ERK activation in OE33 but not Flo-1 cells. Acute
CDDP treatment induced AKT activation in Flo-1 cells
but inhibited activation in OE33 cells. Interestingly, total
AKT expression was reduced in both CDDP-treated cell
lines. Exposure of Flo-1 cells to low doses of either CDDP
or 5-FU for 72 hours did not significantly alter ERK
activation, but the highest dose of CDDP and both doses
of 5-FU analyzed significantly increased AKT activation.
These results suggest that EAC cell lines utilize different
signaling pathways in their response to chemotherapy.

treatment induced ERK phosphorylation in all 3 EAC
cell lines, we assessed whether the MEK1/2 inhibitor,
selumetinib, or the more potent MEK1/2 inhibitor,
trametinib, would sensitize Flo-1 cells to CDDP following
IGFBP2 knockdown. Doses that inhibited ERK1/2
activation effectively increased IGFBP2 expression
(Figure 5A and 5B), reduced cell viability and enhanced
CDDP sensitivity in both serum-free and serum-replete
conditions. When combined with knockdown of IGFBP2,
both selumetinib and trametinib increased sensitivity to
CDDP in serum-replete (Figure 5C and 5D) but not in
serum-free culture conditions (Supplementary Figure S9A
and S9B).
Since knockdown of IGFBP2 induced AKT
activation in Flo-1 cells, we hypothesized that inhibition
of this pathway would further sensitize cells to CDDP.
Doses of the potent, selective AKT Inhibitor VIII that
completely abrogated AKT activation decreased IGFBP2
expression (Figure 6A) and dramatically reduced Flo-1
cell viability (Supplementary Figure S10). For combined
inhibitor analyses, lower doses of inhibitor were necessary
to capture additive/synergistic effects. In serum-free
conditions, sensitization to CDDP was enhanced by
addition of AKT Inhibitor VIII to siIGFBP2-treated cells
(Figure 6B), suggesting that simultaneous modulation of
AKT and IGFBP2 may be a useful treatment strategy.
Although there was a slight dose-dependent decrease in
cell viability following combined AKT Inhibitor VIII
and siIGFBP2 treatment, the addition of AKT Inhibitor
VIII did not further enhance siIGFBP2-induced CDDP
cytotoxicity in serum-replete conditions (Supplementary
Figure S9C).

ERK and AKT status during siIGFBP2mediated chemosensitization
We then determined the impact of IGFBP2 inhibition on
ERK or AKT signaling in IGF1- and/or CDDP-treated EAC
cells (Figure 4C). IGFBP2-silenced Flo-1 cells were treated
in the presence or absence of IGF1 and CDDP for 3 days. In
serum-free conditions, ERK activation decreased following
IGFBP2 knockdown. CDDP induced ERK activation in both
serum-free and serum-replete conditions but this response was
attenuated in cells treated with siIGFBP2. Only subtle changes
in AKT activation were observed, suggesting that AKT
activation may not be a sustained response to this combination
treatment. Further examination of these signaling pathways
using the individual siRNAs to IGFBP2 in the SMARTpool
confirmed that IGFBP2 knockdown reduced CDDP-induced
ERK activation (Figure 4D). CDDP similarly induced ERK
activation in OE19 cells (Supplementary Figure S8). IGFBP2
knockdown with the most effective individual siIGFBP2 from
the SMARTpool reduced ERK activation in the presence or
absence of both IGF1 and CDDP. Effector differences among
individual siRNAs in a SMARTpool have been previously
reported [45] and may reflect differences in sequence-specific
thermodynamics that translate into differences in effectiveness
between oligos.

DISCUSSION
Our clinical group and others have shown that the
vast majority of esophageal cancers are resistant to existing
chemotherapy options, which include treatment with
platinum-based agents, taxanes and antimetabolites, with
only 15–40% showing a pathological complete response
[3–5] when combined with radiation therapy. As IGFBP2
has been shown to play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis,
progression and chemoresistance in many organ systems
and is a known modulator of two key activated signaling
pathways in esophageal cancer [22–40], we examined
its role in EAC progression and chemoresistance and its
utility as a potential target for treatment of chemoresistant
patients.
While IGFBP2 expression varied across the
spectrum of disease represented by the progression from
dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus to EAC, a subset of EAC
samples expressed very high levels of IGFBP2. We
explored whether IGFBP2 in such a subset of tumors might
be associated with tumorigenesis or treatment resistance.

In a cohort of patients who received chemotherapy
following esophagectomy, IGFBP2 expression was
significantly higher in the resected EACs of patients with
shorter disease-free intervals. Additionally, real-time PCR
analysis showed that IGFBP2 expression was higher
among tumor specimens obtained from patients who had
treatment-resistant EACs as compared with patients who
had not yet received chemotherapy. The broad range of
IGFBP2 expression within the chemonaïve group, coupled
with our finding that higher IGFBP2 levels correlated with
chemoresistance, suggests that a subset of these tumors
may have exhibited resistance if treated. This idea is
consistent with the observation that 20–30% of treated
EACs show a high degree of resistance [3, 4]. It is also
probable that mechanisms of treatment resistance in some
of the tumors were independent of IGFBP2 expression. As
pretreatment biopsies were not available for the patients
found to have treatment-resistant EACs, it is not clear
whether higher IGFBP2 levels in these patients were
treatment-induced or inherent in patient tissues prior to
treatment. We have shown, however, that CDDP and 5-FU
treatments did not induce but rather inhibited IGFBP2
expression in Flo-1 and OE33 cell lines. Additionally, in a
study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, elevated
IGFBP2 serum levels remained high from diagnosis
through intensive chemotherapy treatment for relapsed
patients, while levels were significantly reduced in patients
in remission [47], suggesting that high IGFBP2 level is
prognostic of worse treatment response.
The three EAC cell lines Flo-1, OE19, and OE33
were evaluated in functional assays to investigate the role
of IGFBP2 in EAC tumorigenesis and chemoresistance.
Effective knockdown of IGFBP2 expression was obtained
with IGFBP2-targeting siRNA in Flo-1 and OE19
cells while IGFBP2 re-expression was accomplished
by stable transfection or exogenous supplementation
in OE33 cells. Since serum deprivation is a common
environmental condition in tumors and different pathways
can be utilized based on serum status [48, 49], our studies
were performed in both serum-free and serum-replete
conditions. Additionally, as IGFBP2 is a known modulator
of IGF signaling, we attempted to eliminate serum factors
that could mask or interfere with our experimental
manipulations. It has been previously reported that
expression of downstream targets of the PI3K-AKT
and EGFR-MAPK pathways increased following serum
starvation in gliomas [50]. Serum starvation in vitro has
been shown to reduce growth factor levels and has been
reported to lead to a proliferation-quiescent status in
normal cells while activating the cellular DNA damage
response pathway in cancer cells [51]. Additionally,
serum deprivation up-regulated invasion and the Na+/
H+ exchanger (NHE), the principle pH-regulating
mechanism in tumor cells, while serum replete conditions
inhibited NHE activity and invasion of breast cancer cells
in a PI3K-dependent manner [52]. Comparison of fifty
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

fibroblast cultures derived from ten anatomical sites that
were cultured in 10% serum versus 0.1% serum revealed a
shared stereotypical fibroblast core serum response (CSR)
that strongly correlated with a typical wound healing
response [53]. The wound-like phenotype predicted
increased risk of metastasis and death. Examination of this
CSR in different tumor types found that although almost
all prostate and hepatocellular carcinomas had the seruminduced signature, the CSR signature was evident in some
breast, lung, and gastric carcinomas but absent in others,
reemphasizing the importance of establishing response
in the context of both serum-deplete and serum-replete
conditions.
Silencing IGFBP2 in Flo-1 EAC cells resulted in
significant sensitization to CDDP in serum-supplemented
conditions, independent of the addition of IGF1 or IGF2,
but was not as effective in serum-free conditions. This
difference may be due to the fact that rapidly dividing
cancer cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy and/or
modulation but also that IGFBP2 may affect different
pathways depending on the presence or absence of
additional growth factors. Modulation of IGFBP2
expression was less effective in OE19 and OE33 cells,
suggesting that IGFBP2 is not a driver of resistance in
these ERBB2 (HER2/neu)-amplified [45] EAC cell lines.
Subtle differences in migration and invasion assays
suggest that this gene may contribute to the metastatic
potential of EAC cells. We also observed, however, that
IGFBP2 knockdown alone and CDDP treatment itself
induced the expression of several EMT-promoting genes
in Flo-1 cells. This may warrant further exploration as this
may confound the utility of this gene as a target to combat
EAC chemoresistance.
IGFBP2 has been shown to reduce PTEN expression
and enhance AKT activation in response to IGF1 through
its heparin-binding domain [19]. It plays a key role in
AKT pathway activation during glioma development and
progression [32] and its knockdown has been shown to
decrease IGF1-stimulated AKT activation in vascular
smooth muscle cells [54] and acute leukemia cells [35].
In contrast to what has been previously reported, IGFBP2
knockdown activated AKT in Flo-1 EAC cells, and the
effect was further enhanced by the addition of IGF1. We
also observed an inverse correlation between IGFBP2
expression and AKT activation following acute high dose
and 3-day low dose treatment with both CDDP and 5-FU.
These observations and previously published data showing
enhanced efficacy of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
and cytotoxic agents with AKT inhibition [55] prompted
us to evaluate whether Akt inhibition might increase tumor
cell response to CDDP. In the absence of serum but in the
presence of IGF1, AKT inhibitor VIII further enhanced
the effects of a 3-day treatment with CDDP and was even
more effective following IGFBP2 knockdown, suggesting
that the acute AKT activation following IGFBP2
knockdown may have been a compensatory survival
25909

Oncotarget

mechanism. In fact, a compensatory activation of insulin
receptor-AKT signaling has been previously reported
with IGF-1R monoclonal antibody therapy in human
tumor cells [56, 57]. In the presence of serum, however,
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation did not improve
response to chemotherapy over IGFBP2 knockdown alone,
indicating that these mediators may be acting through the
same signaling pathway or that other signaling pathways
predominate in serum-replete conditions.
Modulation of IGFBP2 levels has been shown
to affect ERK activation as well. Human recombinant
IGFBP2 activated the ERK signaling pathway and
stimulated proliferation in glioblastoma cells (through
an integrin β1-dependent mechanism) [33] and ovarian
cancer cells [58] and was shown to increase ERK as well
as AKT activation in breast cancer cells [23]. Inhibition
of the ERK pathway with PD98059 and U1026 abrogated
IGFBP2-induced activation [33, 58]. While lentivirusbased shRNA silencing of IGFBP2 decreased activation
of ERK and AKT in human leukemia cells [35], it resulted
in the inability of p53 to inhibit IGF1-induced ERK
phosphorylation in PC-3 cells [59]. We show that IGFBP2
knockdown also led to decreased ERK activation in Flo1 and OE19 EAC cells, suggesting that ERK may be a
downstream target of IGFBP2 in this tissue type as well.
Interestingly, previous studies have shown that resistance
to the IGF-1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 may be driven by
its inability to inhibit RAS/RAF/ERK activity in colon
[60], biliary tract [61] and esophageal cancer [62]. In light
of this and because CDDP treatment inhibited IGFBP2
expression but induced ERK activation in EAC cells,
we tested whether MEK1/2 inhibitors could enhance
siIGFBP2-induced CDDP cytotoxicity in Flo-1 cells. As
opposed to AKT Inhibitor VIII, selumetinib and trametinib
enhanced siIGFBP2-induced CDDP sensitization in
serum-replete conditions but not in serum-free conditions.
These data support the idea that activation of different
signaling pathways can be dependent on serum status
and that the effectiveness of targeted therapy may be
dependent on the tumor microenvironment.
Despite promising data in preclinical models
and a strong rationale for targeting the IGF signaling
pathway in cancer, clinical efficacy of select IGF-1R
inhibitors has been disappointing in multiple studies
across many different tumor types [57]. Lack of targeted
specificity, dependence on IGF1 levels and activation of
compensatory pathways have all been implicated in the
failure to improve current standard of care treatment.
Of note, a phase I clinical trial using combination
cixutumumab and selumetinib in advanced solid tumors
showed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit [63].
IGFBP2 modulation is a promising alternative to IGF-1R
inhibition due to its multi-faceted nature as a modulator
of the IGF pathway, integrin signaling, cell-matrix
interactions and transcription [16, 64]. Currently, a NCIsponsored Phase I clinical trial is in progress to test the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

safety and immunogenicity of an IGFBP2-encoding DNA
plasmid-based vaccine in patients with advanced stage or
recurrent ovarian cancer, with the hopes of generating an
IGFBP2-specific Th1 immune response (NCT01322802).
Additional clinical trials are utilizing IGFBP2 as a
potential immunotherapy target (NCT00821964) as well
as a marker for cancer risk (NCT02450097), for colorectal
cancer survival (NCT00503685) and for monitoring
breast cancer treatment response (NCT01293032).
Due to the established importance of both the IGF and
integrin signaling pathways in esophageal cancer, IGFBP2
would be an ideal therapeutic target in the treatment of
EAC. Our results linking increased IGFBP2 expression
to chemoresistance in a subset of primary EACs and
increased chemosensitization with its down-regulation in
EAC cells makes it a strong candidate to combat resistant
disease that so often claims the lives of patients.
In summary, oligonucleotide microarray and realtime PCR analyses implicated IGFBP2 as a potential
mediator of chemoresistance in a subset of EACs.
Further in vitro analyses of its role in EAC progression
and chemoresistance showed that modulation of
IGFBP2 expression affected proliferation, motility, and
chemosensitization of EAC cells in a serum-dependent
manner. Silencing of IGFBP2 affected both AKT and
ERK activity and addition of targeted pharmacologic
inhibitors of these pathways enhanced siIGFBP2induced CDDP chemosensitization. Modulation of
IGFBP2 in overexpressing EACs may be an effective
approach to sensitizing resistant tumors to standard
of care chemotherapy. Identification of such potential
mechanisms of chemoresistance might have direct
relevance for subjects currently being enrolled into
therapeutic clinical trials, as these studies frequently
include platinum-based therapy. While further in vitro
studies and clinical validation will be needed, our findings
suggest that characterization of IGFBP2 expression
could inform treatment selection for subjects with
esophageal adenocarcinoma, particularly for the majority
of patients whose tumors do not demonstrate HER2/neu
overexpression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

esophageal squamous tissue, Barrett’s esophageal tissue
and EACs as previously described [66] using Trizol
(Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy column purification
(Qiagen, Valencia CA) per the manufacturers’ instructions.

stage IIb EAC and has been described previously [65].
OE33 and OE19 were derived from stage IIa and III EAC
patient tumors respectively, and are maintained by The
European Collection of Cell Cultures (Sigma-Aldrich,
Corp.; St Louis MO). Cell lines were grown in DMEM
(Flo-1) or RPMI (OE33 and OE19) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals,
Norcross GA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone
(Invitrogen) at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide/95% air.

manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted from the spin
column using RNase-free dH2O and reverse-transcribed
using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Cat#: 4368814) from Life Technologies (Waltham,
MA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR
amplification using 20 ng total RNA, Power SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Cat#: 4367659; Life Technologies), and
0.2 μM both forward and reverse primers (Supplementary
Table S2) was performed on the Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000
(Qiagen) or the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection
System (Life Technologies) through the University of
Michigan Sequencing Core. Annealing temperatures
were optimized using the Cepheid SmartCycler (Cepheid,
Sunnyvale, CA). Melt curves were monitored for
nonspecific SYBR Green signals. Significant differences
of relative quantification were determined using the 2-ΔΔCt
method [69] with normalization to GAPDH or β-actin.

TMA at 4 micron thickness were labeled with a 1:600
dilution of IGFBP2 antibody (Cat#: sc-6001; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Microwave citric acid epitope retrieval was
performed for 20 minutes. Slides were lightly counterstained

with the manufacturer’s directions. Relative proliferation
rates of EAC cell lines and chemosensitivity analyses
in stably transfected OE33 cells were calculated as a
percentage of the initial T0 reading within each cell line.
T0 readings were measured 24 hours post-seeding and
marked the initiation of respective treatments. Relative
cell viability was calculated as ODT/ODC × 100, where
ODT represented the absorbance of the treatment group
and ODC represented the absorbance of the control group.

Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis

Cells were densely plated in triplicate and allowed
to grow to 100% confluence. Following serum-starvation
for 24 hours, cell monolayers were wounded with sterile
p200 tips. Digital images of predetermined locations in
each well were taken at both 4× optical magnification
on an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope using a SPOT
Idea 1.3 MP camera and analyzed with SPOT Basic
software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI)
immediately after wounding and subsequently until the
wounds were closed. The percentage of initial wound
width was determined by averaging measurements per
well at each time point. These percentages were then
averaged per group and compared across groups.

Wound healing assay

Total cellular protein was extracted in lysis buffer
(150 mM NaCl; 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM
EGTA; 2.5 mM Na4P2O7; 1 mM glycerol 2-phosphate
disodium salt hydrate; 1 mM Na3VO4; 1% Triton X-100)
supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (20 μL/1
mL lysis buffer; Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at
14,000 rpm, 4°C for 15 minutes. Twenty to 40 μg total
cell lysate were boiled in 1x LDS Non-reducing Sample
Buffer (Cat#: 84788; Life Technologies) supplemented
with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Cat#:161-0710; Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA), resolved on 4-20% Trisglycine gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked
with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (Cat#: A7906, SigmaAldrich) or Blotting-grade Blocker (Cat#: 170-6404;
Bio-Rad) for 1 hour at room temperature, incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C and subsequently with
its respective secondary antibody at room temperature
for 1 hour, and detected using Amersham ECL Prime
Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Cat#: RPN2232; GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ).

Matrigel invasion assay
Ice-cold matrigel was diluted with coating buffer
to a final concentration of 250 μg/mL. Diluted matrigel
(100 μL) was added to each upper chamber of a 24-well
transwell plate and allowed to gel at 37°C for 6 hours. Flo1 cells that had been pretreated with siIGFBP2 or Nontarget siRNA control (Dharmacon) were trypsinized and
resuspended in siRNA-containing serum-free DMEM to a
final concentration of 40,000 cells in 500 μL and added
to each transwell in duplicate. Pretreated cells were also
added to uncoated transwells to serve as internal controls
for each treatment group. Lower chambers were filled with
750 μL 10% FBS DMEM and plates were incubated at
37°C for 36 hours. Transwells were removed and stained
with Diff-Quick solution. Noninvaded cells were scraped
from the inside of the transwell with a cotton swab.
Invaded cells were counted in 5 fields per transwell by light
microscopy and percent invasion was calculated as IC/IUNC
× 100, where IC represented total invaded cells counted per
coated transwell and IUNC represented total invaded cells
counted per uncoated transwell for each treatment group.

Construction of IGFBP2 stable cell line
An IGFBP2 mammalian expression construct was
created and stably tranfected into OE33 cells. IGFBP2
was PCR-amplified from the cDNA of endogenously
expressing Flo-1 cells using the GC-Rich PCR System
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and primers containing EcoRI
and BamHI restriction sites for directional cloning into the
pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The
pEGFP-IGFBP2 or empty vector construct was transfected
into OE33 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent
(Roche) per the manufacturer’s instructions and selected
with 1000 μg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen). Colonies were
ring-cloned, expanded and then maintained in growth
media containing 200 μg/ml Geneticin.
