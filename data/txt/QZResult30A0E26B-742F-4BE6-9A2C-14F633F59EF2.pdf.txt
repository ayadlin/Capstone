BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer can decrease the number of evaluable lymph nodes.
Hence, the prognostic role of lymph node evaluation in patients with rectal cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiation is unclear. The authors of this report evaluated the prognostic impact of the number of lymph nodes examined in patients with rectal cancer who had negative lymph nodes based on the pathologic extent of disease (ypN0)
after they received preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2004, 372 patients with nonmetastatic rectal adenocarcinoma received preoperative chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision and had ypN0
disease. The median radiation dose was 45 gray, and 68% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS:
Patients had a median of 7 lymph nodes examined after preoperative chemoradiation. Compared with patients who
had 7 lymph nodes examined, patients who had >7 lymph nodes had higher 5-year rates of freedom from relapse
(86% vs 72%; log-rank P ¼ .005) and cancer-specific survival (95% vs 86%; log-rank P ¼ .0004), but no significant difference was observed in the overall survival rate (87% vs 81%; log-rank P ¼ .07). Multivariate Cox proportional models
demonstrated that patients who had >7 lymph nodes examined had a significantly lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.39; P ¼ .003) and death from rectal cancer (HR, 0.45; P ¼ .04) but a similar risk of all-cause mortality (HR,
0.75; 95% CI, 0.46-1.20; P ¼ .23) compared with patients who had 7 lymph nodes examined. CONCLUSIONS: The
number of lymph nodes examined was associated independently with disease relapse and cancer-specific survival in
patients with rectal cancer who had ypN0 disease after receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Hence, the authors
concluded that the number of negative lymph nodes examined may be a prognostic factor in patients with rectal

The number of lymph nodes examined is a well established prognostic factor in patients with colorectal cancers.1-5 Studies specifically in patients with rectal cancer have demonstrated that the number of retrieved lymph nodes is associated significantly with relapse and survival rates in patients with stage II rectal cancer.6,7 The inability to examine a sufficient
number of lymph nodes may lead to failure in identifying metastatic lymph nodes and, thus, may portend a worse prognosis. Consequently, the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer recommend
examining at least 10 to 14 negative lymph nodes to validate appropriate staging.8
Preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgical resection is the current standard of care for patients with stage II
and III rectal cancer (T3 or T4 tumor classification and/or positive lymph node status [N1-2]).9-14 However, many studies

have reported a significant decrease in the number of
lymph nodes retrieved from patients with locally
advanced rectal cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiation.15-19 For example, a study based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry
demonstrated that only 19% of patients with stage II rectal cancer who received preoperative radiotherapy had at
least 12 lymph nodes retrieved for staging.17
To date, the association between the number of
lymph nodes examined and long-term outcome of lymph
node-negative patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiation
has not been well characterized. Hence, we performed this
single-institution, retrospective cohort study to evaluate
the prognostic impact of the number of lymph nodes
examined in lymph node-negative patients who had
received preoperative chemoradiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Between May 1990 and October 2004, 372 patients with
newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of
the rectum (12 cm from the anal verge) received preoperative fluorouracil-based chemoradiation followed by
mesorectal excision at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center and had negative lymph node
status based on the pathologic extent of disease (ypN0)
identified. The clinical and radiation therapy data were
reviewed for each patient in this study, and the study was
approved by the University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Review Board.
Pretreatment Evaluation
All patients underwent digital rectal examination, chest
x-ray, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography
(CT) scans, and endoscopy. Endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) was performed in 84% of patients. Clinical staging was based on the findings from EUS and CT scans.
The sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer TNM system was used for staging.20
Treatment
All 372 patients received preoperative radiation therapy
with concurrent chemotherapy followed by mesorectal
excision. In total, 245 patients (65.9%) received 45 gray
(Gy) of radiation to the pelvis, and 127 patients (34.1%)
received 45 Gy to the pelvis along with a sequential or
concurrent boost. Radiation therapy was delivered in 1.8Gy fractions Monday through Friday, typically over 5 or

3714

6 weeks, using 15-MV to 18-MV photons and customized blocking. A 3-field technique (1 posterior field and 2
lateral fields) and an open tabletop (belly board) device
for bowel exclusion were used in 99% of patients.
Concurrent chemotherapy was administered with
continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in 287 patients
(77.2%), capecitabine in 72 patients (19.4%), sequential
5-FU and capecitabine in 2 patients (0.5%), 5-FU and
cisplatin in 6 patients (1.6%), and uracil and tegafur in 5
patients (1.3%). The details of the radiation therapy and
chemotherapy regimens were described in an earlier
publication.21
All patients underwent mesorectal excision, including low anterior resection in 151 patients (40.6%), proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis in 85 patients
(22.9%), abdominoperineal resection in 116 patients
(31.2%), pelvic exenteration in 18 patients (4.8%), and
other types of nonsphincter-sparing resection in 2 patients
(0.5%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was received by 254
patients (68.3%). The adjuvant chemotherapy regimens
were 5-FU-based therapy in 182 patients (71.7%): 1
patient received 5-FU only, 4 patients received 5-FU and
levamisole, 174 patients received 5-FU and leucovorin
(15 patients received additional levamisole, and 1 received
additional irinotecan), and 3 patients received combined
5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Capecitabine was
received by 52 patients (20.5%), uracil and tegafur was
received by 5 patients (2.0%), and 18 patients (7.1%)
received an unknown adjuvant chemotherapy agent. The
median follow-up was 7.6 years (range, from 2 months to
18.6 years).
After surgery, operative pathologic specimens were
reviewed by gastrointestinal pathologists at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who determined the tumor pathology, pathologic stage, and
number of retrieved lymph nodes. For the purposes of the
current study, information on the number of retrieved
lymph nodes was obtained from the pathology reports at
the time of surgery.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
The patients were divided into 2 subgroups based on the
median number of lymph nodes retrieved (7 lymph
nodes retrieved vs >7 lymph nodes retrieved). In a separate analysis, the patients were divided into 4 subgroups
(3 lymph nodes retrieved, 3-7 lymph nodes retrieved,
8-12 lymph nodes retrieved, and >12 lymph nodes

retrieved) based on the quartile distributions of the numbers of lymph nodes examined. Chi-square tests or Fisher
exact tests were used to determine the significance of the
association between subgroups of patients and the following categorical variables: sex, race, neoadjuvant chemotherapy type, year of surgery (1990-1994, 1995-1999, or
2000-2004), type of surgery (sphincter-sparing or nonsphincter-sparing), anal canal involvement, diagnostic
histology, clinical T classification (cT), clinical lymph
node classification (N), pathologic tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, downstaging (cT
classification > ypT stage), receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, local recurrence/distant metastasis, and vital status. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the
median levels and overall distributions of the following
continuous variables: age, tumor size, and distance from
the anal verge.
Survival and the time to recurrence/distant metastasis within each subgroup of patients were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method.22 The length of follow-up was
measured from the time of surgery to either the time of
local recurrence/distant metastasis (for assessing the time
to relapse), death from rectal cancer (for cancer-specific
survival), death from any cause (for overall survival), or
last contact. The log-rank test23 was used for univariate
comparison of risk factors between subgroups of patients.
A Cox proportional hazards model24 was used to compute
univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing prognostic risk factors between patients who had 7
lymph nodes retrieved and patients who had >7 lymph
nodes retrieved.

RESULTS
Among the 372 patients in this study, the clinical tumor
classification was as follows: T2 (tumor invading the muscularis propria) in 20 patients (5.4%), T3 (tumor invading through the muscularis propria) in 313 patients
(84.1%), T4 (tumor invading other organs or structures)
in 36 patients (9.7%), and unknown in 3 patients (0.8%).
The clinical lymph node classification was N0 (no
regional lymph node metastasis) in 195 patients (52.4%),
N1 (metastasis in 1-3 regional lymph nodes) in 167
patients (44.9%), N2 (metastasis in 4 regional lymph
nodes) in 3 patients (0.8%), and unknown in 7 patients
(1.9%). The pathologic tumor classification was as follows: well differentiated adenocarcinoma in 22 patients
(5.9%), moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in 274
patients (73.7%), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma

in 18 patients (4.8%), and unknown in 58 patients
(15.6%). The median number of lymph nodes examined
was 7 (range, 0-40 lymph nodes examined).
The median follow-up was 8.4 years for patients
who had 7 lymph nodes retrieved (20 patients were
lost to follow-up, which was defined by a lack of patient
contact in the last 2 years) and 6.8 years for patients who
had >7 lymph nodes retrieved (17 patients were lost to
follow-up). Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of the
372 patients according to the number of lymph nodes
retrieved (7 vs >7). Patients who had 7 lymph nodes
retrieved were more likely to 1) receive concurrent 5-FU
(89.4% vs 64.7%) than capecitabine (6.9% vs 32.1%;
P <. 0001), 2) not receive a radiation boost (21.8% vs
46.7%; P < .0001), 3) undergo nonsphincter-sparing
surgery (43.6% vs 29.4%; P ¼ .004), 4) have extension
to the anal canal (38.8% vs 22.3%; P ¼ .0005), 5) have
a larger tumor size (P ¼ .04), and 6) have clinical N0
lymph node status (59.6% vs 45.1%; P ¼ .02) compared
with patients who had 7 lymph nodes examined. In
addition, patients who had 7 lymph nodes examined
were less likely undergo surgery after 2000 (12.2% vs
44.6%; P < .0001) and were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (57.8% vs 82.2%; P<.0001) compared with those who had >7 lymph nodes examined.
Between the 2 subgroups of patients, there was no significant difference in the distributions of sex, age, race, clinical T classification, pathologic T stage, lymphovascular
invasion, perineural invasion, or downstaging status.
During follow-up, 16 patients developed local
recurrences (4.3%). Of these, 13 patients also had distant
metastasis (4 patients had both local recurrence and distant metastasis detected at the same time, 8 patients had
local recurrence as the first site of failure then metastasis in
1 year, and 1 patient had metastasis detected first and local
recurrence detected later). Only 3 patients had a local
recurrence without distant metastasis during follow-up.
In total, 69 patients (18.5%) developed distant metastasis
(13 patients also had a local recurrence, as described
above), 111 patients (29.7%) patients died, and 46
patients (12.3%) had documented death from rectal cancer. It is noteworthy that, because of the small number of
patients with local recurrence only, patients who had local
recurrence and/or distant metastasis were grouped
together in subsequent analyses.
The estimated 5-year rates of freedom from relapse/
metastasis, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival
according to the number of lymph nodes examined are
listed in Table 2. The Kaplan-Meier curves for freedom

A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate HRs of disease relapse/metastasis, cancer-specific

cer-specific death (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.61; P ¼
.0008) over the follow-up period compared with patients
who had 7 lymph nodes examined (Table 3). It is noteworthy that patients who had >7 lymph nodes retrieved
also had an approximately 68% lower risk of local recurrence with or without distant metastasis (HR, 0.32; 95%
CI, 0.10-1.0; P ¼ .05). However, it should be noted that
13 of the 16 patients who developed a local recurrence
also had distant metastasis, as described above.
The results remained significant after adjusting for
age, sex, race, clinical tumor and lymph node classification, pathologic tumor stage, downstaging, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, distance from the anal verge, and
year of surgery in the multivariate model. Further adjustments for radiation dose, tumor size, anal canal involvement, and type of neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not
change the results significantly (data not shown), and
these variables were not included in subsequent multivariate models. Tumor histology was not included in the multivariate model because of a large percentage of missing
data and also because the majority of patients had moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The 2 groups of
patients did not have a statistically significant difference
in the risk of all-cause mortality in either univariate analysis (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47-1.03; P ¼ .07) or multivariate analysis (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46-1.20; P ¼ .23).
Among the covariates that were adjusted in the multivariate model, only black race and distance from the anal
verge were associated independently with disease relapse/
metastasis (Table 4).
Comparable results were obtained when the
patients were divided into 4 subgroups based on quartile distributions according to the number of lymph

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we evaluated the prognostic impact of
the number of lymph nodes retrieved from patients with
ypN0 rectal cancer who received preoperative chemoradiation therapy followed by mesorectal excision. The number
of lymph nodes examined was associated independently with
the rates of cancer-specific survival and freedom from disease
relapse or metastasis in both univariate and multivariate proportional hazard models. Patients who had 7 lymph nodes
examined had a higher rate of disease relapse or metastasis

and a lower rate of cancer-specific survival compared with
patients who had >7 lymph nodes examined.
Lymph node retrieval and assessment is critical in
rectal cancer staging and can impact further interventional
decisions, such as adjuvant chemotherapy. A positive
lymph node is more likely to be identified if more lymph
nodes are examined, and patients with lymph node-negative colorectal cancer, on average, have fewer lymph nodes
examined than patients with lymph node-positive disease.7,25 The National Cancer Institute guidelines have
recommended a minimum of 12 lymph nodes for
adequately staging a lymph node-negative colorectal cancer.8,26 However, the number of lymph nodes retrieved
can vary significantly, depending on the anatomic site,
with lower yield in resected rectal cancer specimens and
higher yield in colon cancer specimens.27,28
Preoperative radiation (with or without chemotherapy) can decrease the number of retrieved lymph
nodes substantially, likely because of lymph node atrophy, fibrosis, and lymphocyte depletion.29 Studies have
demonstrated that chemoradiation significantly decreases
the number of lymph nodes retrieved in surgical rectal
specimens.16,17,19,29 A study based on the SEER registry
indicated that patients who received preoperative radiation therapy had an average of 7 lymph nodes retrieved
compared with 10 lymph nodes from patients who did
not receive preoperative radiation.17 Similar results were
observed in another study in which an average of 13
lymph nodes were retrieved from patients who received
preoperative radiation, and an average of 19 lymph
nodes were retrieved from patients who did not receive
preoperative radiation.16 Rullier et al also demonstrated
that, compared with patients who did not receive preoperative chemoradiation, those who did had a decreased
mean number of lymph nodes retrieved (17 lymph
nodes vs 13 lymph nodes) and a decreased mean number of positive lymph nodes (2.3 lymph nodes vs 1.2
lymph nodes).19 Taflampas et al reported that preoperative chemoradiation did not reduce the overall number
of lymph nodes retrieved but did increase the percentage
of patients with <12 lymph nodes examined.30 In contrast, a study of selected patients who were treated on
the German rectal cancer trial indicated that extensive
pathologic evaluation may enable the detection of high
numbers of lymph nodes (median, 30 lymph nodes)
even after preoperative chemoradiation.31
Aside from preoperative chemoradiation, other factors, such as the extent of surgery, thorough pathologic
assessment, tumor location, histologic grade, and other

3720

patient-related factors, can have a significant impact on
the number of lymph nodes retrieved.32-35 Among
patients who received preoperative radiation therapy (5 
5 Gy), more lymph nodes were retrieved after low anterior
resection than after abdominoperineal resection.36 Lymph
node yield also differed significantly between laboratories
and pathologists. It has been demonstrated that the fatclearance method of lymph node harvest has a significant
impact on the number of lymph nodes examined and
lymph node staging among patients with lymph nodenegative rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation
compared with traditional methods.37 Injection of the inferior mesenteric artery with methylene blue dye also can
increase lymph node harvest.38 In addition, among lymph
node-negative patients, specimens from tumors that
measured >5 cm in greatest dimension contained more
lymph nodes than specimens from tumors that measured
<2 cm (10.0 lymph nodes vs 4.4 lymph nodes).36 Lymph
node-negative patients who had well differentiated
tumors with extensive lymphoid reaction also had an
increased number of lymph nodes retrieved, although histologic grade did not have an impact on the number of
lymph nodes retrieved. Older patients typically have fewer
lymph nodes harvested, probably secondary to reduced
inflammatory and immunologic reactions to cancer.28,35,39 However, of the above factors, only patient
age, tumor size, and type of surgical procedure were associated significantly with the number of lymph nodes
retrieved among lymph node-negative patients in multivariate analysis.36
Previous studies that evaluated the association
between the number of lymph nodes examined and prognosis in patients with rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation reported various results. Luna-Perez et al
conducted a study on 210 patients with either lymph
node-negative or lymph node-positive rectal cancer who
received preoperative chemoradiation, and patients in
that study who had 11 lymph nodes retrieved had a significantly lower rate of local recurrence and a significantly
higher rate of overall survival compared with patients who
had <11 lymph nodes retrieved.40 However, Rullier et al
reported that the number of lymph nodes retrieved was
not associated with disease-free survival or overall survival
among 198 patients with pathologically lymph node-negative disease who received preoperative chemoradiation.19
Moreover, Kim et al observed that, among patients who
received preoperative chemoradiation, the number of
lymph nodes retrieved was not associated significantly
with recurrence or survival in 150 patients with lymph

node-negative rectal cancer.41 However, those studies had
smaller cohorts compared with the current study and,
thus, may have had lower power to detect an association.
To our knowledge, the current study is the largest study to
specifically evaluate the association between the number
of lymph nodes examined and prognosis among patients
with pathologically lymph node-negative rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation.
Low lymph node yield can be secondary to differences in surgical or pathologic approach, intrinsic tumor factors, and patient characteristics, as discussed above.
Tumor understaging because of low lymph node yield
may contribute to decreased time to disease relapse and
shortened cancer-specific survival. Lymph node-negative
patients with low lymph node yield may have been identified as lymph node-positive if more lymph nodes had
been examined. Although only patients who had ypN0
disease were included in our study, 46% of these patients
were lymph node-positive on preoperative staging studies.
The large proportion of clinically lymph node-positive
patients implies that some patients may have been understaged on pathologic staging.
The results from this study need to be interpreted
with caution. Because data on histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion were incomplete, they were not included in the multivariate analysis.
Even with the inclusion of many possible confounders, it
is worth noting that residual confounding still may be
present. Because many of the variables in the multivariate
model are correlated, colinearity of those variables may
make it unnecessary to include all of them in the multivariate model. The study was conducted on patients who
received treatment over a 14-year period, and it is possible
that surgical and pathologic techniques changed over that
time. A lack of data on patients who were lost to followup also potentially may bias the study results. It is noteworthy that the proportion of patients who had >7 lymph
nodes examined increased significantly over the years of
the study period. Consequently, the median follow-up
was longer for patients who had 7 lymph nodes
retrieved, leading to more time for them to develop recurrence than the other group. However, after adjusting for
year of surgery, the observed results remained statistically
significant. In addition, there were considerable differences in the 5-year freedom from recurrence/distant metastasis and survival rates between the 2 patient groups
(Table 2), supporting the conclusion that patients who
had fewer lymph nodes retrieved had a poorer prognosis
than patients who had more lymph nodes retrieved, even

if both groups had a fixed length of follow-up. Furthermore, when we performed a multivariate analysis comparing recurrence/distant metastasis and survival rates
between the 2 groups of patients based only on events that
occurred within 5 years of follow-up, the differences
between the 2 groups remained statistically significant
(data not shown).
In conclusion, the number of lymph nodes examined was associated independently with disease relapse
and cancer-specific survival in patients with ypN0 rectal
cancer who received preoperative chemoradiation.
Although high-quality surgery and thorough pathologic
examination might improve lymph node yield and provide more accurate staging after preoperative chemoradiation, many other factors, including patient-specific and
tumor-specific factors, also may affect the number of lymph
nodes examined. Numerous studies have demonstrated
decreased lymph node yield after preoperative chemoradiation therapy. Many clinicians may be left with imperfect
pathologic lymph node staging from a limited number of
examined lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer who
receive preoperative chemoradiation. Thus, it may be prudent to incorporate information on the number of lymph
nodes examined in patients with negative lymph node into
clinical decision-making. Risk stratification and management based on the number of lymph nodes may help guide
clinicians in counseling patients about their prognosis,
making decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy, and potentially optimizing disease control and survival.
