ABSTRACT
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is currently the most effective treatment regimen
for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but eventually tumor resistance develops
which limits its success. The potential implication of IL-6 signaling in the cisplatin
resistance of NSCLC was explored by testing whether NSCLC cells with different
levels of intracellular IL-6 show different responses to the cytotoxic treatment of
cisplatin. When the cisplatin cytotoxicity of the IL-6 knocked down human NSCLC
cells (A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si) were compared with their corresponding scramble
control cells (A549sc and H157sc), higher cisplatin cytotoxicity was found in IL-6
si cells than sc cells. Subcutaneous xenograft mouse models were developed using
a pair of A549sc and A549IL-6si cells. When the tumor grew to about 400 mm2,
mice were treated with cisplatin and tumor regression was monitored. Higher tumor
regression was detected in the A549IL-6si xenografts compared to A549sc xenografts
following cisplatin treatment. Immunostaining study results from tumor tissues also
supported this finding. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and DNA
repair associated molecules ATM, CHK1, TP73, p53, and ERCC1 were significantly
up regulated in cisplatin-treated A549sc and H157sc cells, but no increase was
detected in A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si cells. Further inhibitor studies revealed that up
regulation of these molecules by IL-6 may be through activation of IL-6 downstream
signaling pathways like Akt, MAPK, Stat3, and Erk. These results provide potential
for combining cisplatin and inhibitors of IL-6 signaling or its downstream signaling
pathway as a future therapeutic approach in preventing development of cisplatin
resistant NSCLC tumors.

recent progress, the therapeutic outcome of lung cancer
remains poor.
Platinum-based drugs, particularly cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin, DDP), are used in the
treatment of many cancers, including lung cancer. Initially,
cisplatin treatment demonstrates favorable outcomes, but
often chemoresistance develops later on and results in
failure of this therapy.
The development of cisplatin resistance is mediated
through multiple mechanisms. It has been well reviewed

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer
death in both men and women [1]. It is heterogeneous
and histologically divided into two types: small cell
lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung
carcinomas (NSCLCs), with the latter comprising
85% of lung cancer cases [2]. NSCLCs also constitute a
heterogeneous population of tumors, including squamous,
adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinomas [1]. Despite

Tumors derived from IL-6 knocked down cell
showed more growth regression than those
derived from IL-6 expressing cells following
cisplatin treatment

in the literature that DNA lesions and the induction of
mitochondrial apoptosis are the most critical mechanisms
of cisplatin action [3, 4]. In addition, enhancement of DNA
repair activity has been observed in cisplatin resistant
cell lines [5]. Involvement of DNA repair defects in the
treatment of NSCLC by cisplatin has also been reported [6].
Recently it was also reported that hyperactivation of PARP
was involved in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells [7]
and inhibition of PARP could selectively increase the
cellular sensitivity to cisplatin [8]. Meanwhile, the use of
genetic variation in predicting the overall survival of lung
cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy has
been reported [9]. Cisplatin resistance can also be triggered
by altered drug delivery system, metabolism, and tumor
microenvironmental changes such as hypoxia [10].
IL-6 (Interleukin-6) is a cytokine that produces a
broad range of cellular and physiological responses upon
activation, and has been implicated in the tumorigenesis
of epithelial cancer [11]. The implication of IL-6 in
NSCLC progression has previously been suggested. In
a study by Yanagawa et al [15], IL-6 was detectable in
29 patients with lung cancer (39%), but not in any of
the patients with benign lung diseases. Yamaji et al [16]
investigated the correlation between IL-6 production and
tumor proliferation in NSCLC, and found 53% of NSCLC
cell lines express IL-6 mRNA and protein. The circulating
IL-6 level has also been suggested as a prognostic marker
for survival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with
chemotherapy [17].
In this study, we investigated whether IL-6 signaling
is important in mediating cisplatin-resistance in NSCLC.
We also revealed the molecular mechanisms by which
IL-6 contributes to this cisplatin-resistance.

To confirm the in vitro results showing higher
cisplatin cytotoxicity in IL-6 knocked down cells, we
performed xenograft studies by implanting A549IL-6si
and A549sc cells subcutaneously into nude mice. When
tumors reached the size of 400 mm3, we injected mice
with cisplatin (3 mg/kg, i.p.) twice a week for 3 weeks
and monitored the subsequent tumor growth. A significant
reduction in tumor growth was detected in A549IL-6si
cell-derived xenografts than those from A549sc cells
following cisplatin injection (Fig. 1C). These results
suggest that the IL-6 knockdown makes tumor cells more
sensitive to cisplatin, and are consistent with the in vitro
cytotoxicity results (Fig. 1A).
We further analyzed the expression of several
molecules in tumor tissues to determine the relationship
between IL-6 and cisplatin sensitivity. Fig. 1D shows
the H&E staining in the upper panel and the IL-6
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in the middle panel,
confirming the IL-6 knockdown status in A549IL-6si cellderived tumors. When the tumor tissues were stained with
the antibody of the proliferation marker Ki67, a lower
number of Ki67 positively-stained cells were detected
in A549IL-6si cell-derived tumors (Fig. 1D, lower
panel), which is consistent with the tumor growth data
(quantification of IL-6 and Ki67 staining results are shown
to the right of Fig. 1D).

IL-6 protected NSCLC cells from cisplatininduced apoptosis via up-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins

RESULTS

One of the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin
resistance is the blocking of cisplatin-induced apoptosis
by IL-6 [3]. To investigate whether the level of IL-6
expression affects the apoptotic cell death in NSCLC
cells following cisplatin treatment, A549IL-6si/sc and
H157IL-6si/sc cells were treated with cisplatin for
48 hours and the apoptotic cell death was analyzed using
the AnnexinV-based flow cytometric method. As shown in
Fig. 2A, more apoptotic death was detected in IL-6si than
sc cells (8.7% vs. 2.8% for A549 cells and 9.5% vs. 3.9%
for H157 cells, respectively).
We then investigated whether the difference in
apoptotic death produced by cisplatin was due to the IL-6
effect on expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules.
When the expression of mRNAs (Fig. 2B) and proteins
(Fig. 2C) of the pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) molecules were measured in
the IL-6si/sc cell pairs, we found a significant increase
in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression (not Bcl-xL and Bax) in
cisplatin-treated sc cells but not in si cells. These results
suggest that intracellular IL-6 is involved in mitigating

Increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in IL-6 knocked
down (si) A549 and H157 cells compared to
scrambled control (sc) cells
To investigate the effects of intracellular levels of
IL-6 on the sensitivity to cisplatin cytotoxicity in NSCLC
cells, we manipulated the IL-6 levels of A549 and H157
NSCLC cell lines in vitro by lentiviral transduction. We
obtained the IL-6 knocked down cells (A549IL-6si and
H157IL-6si) together with their respective scrambled
control cell lines (A549sc and H157sc). High knockdown
efficiency (more than 90%) was confirmed in both IL-6si
cell lines by qPCR and IL-6 ELISA analyses (data not
shown). When cisplatin cytotoxicity was tested in these
cells using the MTT assay, it was found that A549
and H157 cells with knocked down IL-6 were more
sensitive than their scrambled control cells (Fig. 1A, 1B),
suggesting that NSCLC cells showed different responses
to cisplatin treatment depending on their intracellular IL-6
level and reduced level of intracellular IL-6 made cells
more sensitive to cisplatin.

damage produced by cisplatin and is responsible for
the cellular resistance to it. This protection effect may
be attributed through the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and
Mcl-1(anti-apoptotic) molecules. The IHC staining
of tumor tissues obtained from cisplatin-treated A549
xenografts supported the in vitro results by showing a
higher number of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 stained cells in tumors
derived from sc cells than those from IL-6si cells (Fig. 2D,
quantification is shown on the right).

cellular responses to DNA damage are coordinated initially
through the signaling cascades, the Ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM)-CHK [3]. Therefore, the expression
levels of the ATM and CHK1 molecules were first tested
in A549IL-6si/sc and H157IL-6si/sc cells after they
were treated with 5 μM cisplatin for 48 hours. As shown
in Fig. 3A (mRNA level) and Fig. 3B (protein level),
expression levels of ATM and CHK1 were significantly
up-regulated in the IL-6 expressing A549sc and H157sc
cells following cisplatin treatment, but not in A549IL-6si
and H157IL-6si cells. In addition, the expression levels of
p53 and p73, which are well-known downstream targets
of ATM that can lead to the apoptosis [23, 24], and the
DNA excision repair protein ERCC1 [25–27] were also
investigated in this study. Similarly to the results of
ATM and CHK1, expression of all these molecules were
significantly up-regulated in the IL-6 expressing A549sc
and H157sc cells following cisplatin treatment, but not

in A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si cells (Fig. 3A and 3B).
All these results suggest that IL-6 signaling is important
in the repair of the cisplatin-induced DNA damage and
contributes to higher survival rates. IHC staining data
obtained from tumor tissues also supported our hypothesis
by showing a higher number of ATM and CHK1 stained
cells in the A549sc xenografts than in the A549IL-6si
xenografts (Fig. 3C).

associated molecules by cisplatin are through the
activation of these signaling pathways. Inhibitors of each
signaling pathway (SB203850, LY294002, AG490, and
U0126 for inhibiting the MAPK, Akt, JAK/Stat3, and
MEK/Erk pathway, respectively) were added to the IL-6
expressing A549sc and H157sc cells, and then to test
whether the up regulation of two selected molecules, Bcl-2
and ERCC1, by cisplatin can be blocked by the inhibitors.
As shown in Fig. 4B, we found that adding inhibitors
of the MAPK, Akt, and MEK/Erk pathways almost
completely blocked the up regulation of Bcl-2 and ERCC1
molecules, while a lesser effect was observed when the
inhibitor of the JAK/Stat3 pathway was used. From
these results, we conclude that the activation of Stat3,
Erk, MAPK, and Akt signaling pathways are involved in
triggering the IL-6 effect on the up regulation of the antiapoptotic and DNA repair-related molecules, but that the
MAPK, Akt, and MEK/Erk signaling pathways are more
critical than the JAK/Stat3 pathway.

The IL-6 mediated up regulation of the antiapoptotic and DNA repair associated molecules
may be through IL-6 downstream signaling
pathways, such as MAPK/Stat3/Akt/Erk
It has been reported that IL-6 can activate signaling
pathways of Stat3, Erk, MAPK, and Akt [12] [28] [29].
When we investigated activation of these pathways,
with or without cisplatin treatment, we found they were
all highly activated in IL-6 expressing A549sc and
H157sc cells upon cisplatin treatment (5 μM, 72 hours),
but not significantly elevated in the IL-6 knocked down
A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si cells (Fig. 4A).
We then investigated whether IL-6 mediated
up regulation of the anti-apoptotic and DNA repairwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

showed advanced histopathology and increased frequency
of genomic alterations in the cisplatin resistant lung
tumors. Hsieh et al [31] also showed acquisition of an
enhanced aggressive phenotype in cisplatin resistant
NSCLC cells. In addition, Mitsumoto et al [32]
demonstrated significantly enhanced metastatic properties
from in vivo-established cisplatin resistant tumors, and
Barr et al [33] showed that cisplatin resistant NSCLC
cell lines displayed a stem cell-like signature which
may contribute to lung cancer progression. Therefore,
deterring the development of cisplatin-resistance is an
urgent issue in clinical settings where cisplatin is the
preferred therapeutic option.
We showed in a series of in vitro and in vivo mice
studies that NSCLC cells have varied sensitivity to
cisplatin depending on the level of intracellular IL-6. We
observed that IL-6 signaling up-regulated expression of
anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Mcl-1) and DNA repair-associated
molecules (ATM, CHK, ERCC1, p53, TP73) upon
cisplatin treatment while had little effects on the IL-6
knocked down cells. This finding led us to believe that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

whether lung cancer cells respond to cisplatin treatment
and trigger their survival mechanisms depend on the
IL-6 expression levels in the cells. Therefore, the IL-6
expressing NSCLC cells may acquire cisplatin resistance
and have a higher chance to survive than cells with a lower
level of or no intracellular IL-6.
We also found from the series of inhibitor studies
that the up regulation of the genes related to the antiapoptotic and DNA repair processes by IL-6 is through
activation of signaling pathways, including Stat3, Akt,
MAPK, and Erk. The involvement MEK/ERK signaling
[34], p38 MAPK [35], EGFR-Stat3 signaling [36], and
Akt signaling [37, 38], in modulating the DNA repair
process has been previously suggested. Nonetheless, we
cannot exclude the possibility of direct IL-6 modulation
of these molecules at the transcriptional level or through
interaction with other molecules, so further studies are
necessary to confirm this.
In addition to the altered apoptotic process and
modulation of the DNA repair system, there must be
other ways that IL-6 modulates sensitivity/resistance

to cisplatin, such as altered drug uptake, drug delivery
system and metabolism, or tumor microenvironment
changes [30, 39]. Whether IL-6 signaling can trigger these
mechanisms needs to be elucidated in the future.
In our studies, we found that the intracellular level
of IL-6 is critical in protecting cells from apoptosis and
promoting DNA repair upon cisplatin treatment. Our
results suggest that IL-6 autocrine signaling is important.
Since half of the NSCLC cells were reported to secrete
IL-6 endogenously [16] and considering heterogeneity
of tumors consisting mixture of IL-6-expressing
and non-IL-6-expressing cells, the IL-6 autocrine
role seems important. However, IL-6 can also be
secreted from several cell types comprising the tumor
microenvironment such as macrophages [40], endothelial
cells [41], and cancer fibroblasts [42], so the paracrine
role of IL-6 [43] will also be important. Revealing the
paracrine IL-6 role in triggering cisplatin-resistance is a
future project.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We suggest that targeting IL-6 signaling inhibits
or delays cisplatin-resistance in cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. An IL-6 (or downstream signaling)
targeting strategy combined with conventional cisplatin
therapy may reduce or inhibit cisplatin resistance. Further
animal experiments need to be performed to test this
therapy outcome.
There have been several attempts to overcome
cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells. Wu et al [44]
suggested using an inhibitor of mTOR signaling to
overcome cisplatin-resistance. Heavey et al [45]
reported targeting the PI3K-NFκB pathway for battling
cisplatin resistance. In addition, Andriani et al [46]
showed increased sensitivity to cisplatin after applying
a FHIT gene into the NSCLC cells, and Bian et al [47]
reported increasing cisplatin sensitivity of NSCLC cells
by up-regulation of miRNA451. Whether IL-6 targeting
therapy will overcome acquired cisplatin resistance will
be a future project.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNA extraction and quantitativereal-time
PCR (qPCR) analysis

Cell culture

Total RNA (1 μg) was subjected to reverse
transcription using Superscript III transcriptase
(Invitrogen). qPCR was conducted using the appropriate
primers (sequence is provided in Table 1) and a Bio-Rad
CFX96 system with SYBR green to determine the mRNA
expression levels of genes of interest. Expression levels
were normalized to GAPDH level.

A549 and H157 cell lines were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. All cells
were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 environment at
37°C. For inhibition studies, LY294002 (10 μM) (Sigma,
St Louis, MO), SB203850 (10 μM) (Sigma, St Louis,
MO), AG490 (5 μM) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and
U0126 (10 μM)(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) that inhibit
the Akt, MAPK, JAK/Stat3, and MEK/Erk pathways,
respectively, were added into the culture before cisplatin
treatment.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL
aprotinin, 0.2 mM PMSF) and proteins (20–40 μg) were
separated on 8–10% SDS/PAGE gel and then transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After
blocking procedure, membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies (1:1000), HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:5000), and visualized in Imager (Bio-Rad)
using ECL system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester,
NY). Antibodies of GAPDH, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and p53
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA), and antibodies of Mcl-1, p-Akt, p-Erk, p-Stat3,
and p-MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers,
MA). Antibodies of ATM, CHEK1, TP73, and ERCC1 were
obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX).

Development of IL-6 knocked down and sc
control cells by lentiviral transduction
For incorporation of IL-6 siRNA or sc plasmids
into A549 and H157 cells, lentivirus construct carrying
either sc or IL-6 siRNA (pLenti-II vector, Applied
Biological Materials Inc, Canada) was transfected into
293T cells with a mixture of pLent-II-IL-6 siRNA,
psPAX2 (virus-packaging plasmid), and pMD2G (envelope
plasmid) (4:3:2 ratio) using PolyFect Transfection reagent
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After A549 and H157 cells were
virally infected overnight, the culture media containing
the virus was replaced with normal culture media, and
maintained under normal cell culture conditions. After
sub culturing cells, the IL-6 knocked down cells were
selected by culturing cells in the presence of puromycin
(2 μg/ml) (Sigma) and then maintained in media
containing 0.1 μg/ml puromycin.

In vivo xenograft studies
The A549sc and A549IL-6si cells (1 x 106/site) were
subcutaneously injected into flanks of 8 week old female
nude mice (NCI) (10 mice per group, total 20 mice).
Tumor development and volumes were measured twice a
week. When tumor volumes reached 400 mm3, cisplatin
(3 mg/kg) were i.p. injected two times per week and tumor
growth was monitored. At the end of treatment, mice were
sacrificed and tumor tissues were processed for staining.

Cisplatin cytotoxicity test
Cisplatin cytotoxicity was analyzed by MTT
(3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, 5 mg/ml, Sigma, USA) assay. Cells
(A549IL-6si/sc and H157IL-6si/sc) were seeded on
96-well plates (7 × 103 cells/well) and treated with
various concentrations of cisplatin for 48 hours. MTT
test was then performed and absorbance at 490 nm
was measured. Cell viability was calculated using the
formula: OD sample/OD blank control × 100. Triplicate
experiments were performed and average values with
mean ± SEM were represented.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tissues obtained were fixed in 10% (v/v)
formaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and cut into
5-μm sections. Tumor tissue sections were deparaffinized
in xylene solution, rehydrated, and immunostaining was
performed using the IHC kit (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz,
CA). Antibodies of IL-6 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), Ki67
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz,
CA), Mcl-1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and ATM
and CHK1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) (all
antibodies at 1:250 dilution) were applied in staining. For
Ki67 staining, the antigen retrieval process was performed
in 10 mM Citric buffer, pH 6.0 for 20 minutes using a
cooker prior to staining. After staining, tissues were
counterstained by Hematoxylin.

Flow cytometric analysis of Apoptosis
Cells (A549IL-6si/sc and H157IL-6si/sc) were
seeded on 24-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well), treated with
various concentrations of cisplatin for 48 hours, and their
apoptotic death rates were analyzed by the AnnexinV
based apoptosis kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
