Abstract
The development of resistance to platinum drugs in cancer cells severely reduces
the efficacy of these drugs. Thus, the discovery of novel drugs or combined strategies to
overcome drug resistance is imperative. In addition to our previous finding that combined
D-penicillamine with platinum drugs exerts synergistic cytotoxicity, we recently identified
a novel therapeutic strategy by combining an iron chelating agent desferal with platinum
drugs to overcome platinum resistance in an oxaliplatin-resistant human cervical cancer
cell line, S3. Further study demonstrated that the level of platinum–DNA adduct formation
positively correlated with cell death in combination of desferal with platinums than
that of each drug alone in S3 cells. Decrement of human copper transporter 1 (hCtr1)
and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression involved in the development of platinum
resistance in S3 cells. Moreover, desferal promoted the expression of hCtr1 through the
upregulation of Sp1. The overexpression of Sp1 increased the expression of NF-κB and
translocated it into the nucleus to bind to the TfR1 promoter region, which subsequently
increased the expression of TfR1. Importantly, the cotreatment of oxaliplatin with
desferal significantly potentiated the oxaliplatin-elicited antitumoral effect in the
oxaliplatin-resistant xenograft animal model without any toxic effect observed. Taken
together, these results demonstrated that the combination of desferal with oxaliplatin
can overcome oxaliplatin resistance through the regulation of hCtr1 and TfR1, and may
have beneficial effect for treatment of patient with oxaliplatin-refractory tumors.

Introduction

Platinum-based drugs cause cell death through the
formation of a covalent bond between the platinum moiety
of a platinum-based drug and the purine base of DNA [4].
These intra- and inter-strand crosslinks of platinum–DNA
complexes destroy the DNA structure, resulting in cell
death [5]. Studies have reported that reduction in the
intracellular accumulation of platinum–DNA adduct
through the regulation of drug influx and efflux pumps,

The platinum-based drugs, included cisplatin,
oxaliplatin, and carboplatin, were the most commonly
used therapeutic agents for treating solid tumors in clinical
[1]. However, accumulating evidences indicated that the
development of drug resistance severely impedes and
reduces the antitumor effect of these agents [2, 3].

enhancement of DNA repair and drug detoxification, are
major factors contributing to platinum resistance [5, 6].
Platinum drugs enter cells through diffusion or
endocytosis. Studies have reported that human copper
transporter 1 (hCtr1), a copper influx transporter,
participates in the transportation of platinum drugs and
is frequently downregulated in platinum-drug resistant
variants [7, 8]. Two copper efflux transporters, coppertransporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A) and copper-transporting
ATPase 2 (ATP7B), transport platinum drugs from the
cytoplasm into subcellular compartments, primarily
localized to the trans-Golgi network for subsequent
efflux in a similar manner to their effect on copper
[9]. This action reduces the cytotoxicity of platinum
drugs and causes drug resistance. We and others have
demonstrated that the decreased expression of hCtr1
and overexpression of ATP7A and ATP7B have a crucial
role in the development of platinum resistance [10–14].
Moreover, our previous study reported that combination
of D-penicillamine, a copper chelator, and platinum drugs
exhibits synergistic interaction in oxaliplatin-resistant
cancer cells through modulation of hCtr1 and ATP7A
expression [13, 14]. Thus, we proposed that the metal
chelators, such as iron chelators, may also be benefit in
manipulation of copper transporters and sensitize resistant
cancer cells with chemotherapeutic agents. In the present
study, we first time demonstrated that combination of
desferal, an iron-chelating agent, with platinum drugs
synergistically inhibits tumor growth and promotes tumor
cell death in oxaliplatin-resistant cells in vitro and in
preclinical human xenograft animal model. The underlying
mechanism for this synergism, at least in part, is through
the upregulation of hCtr1 and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)
by desferal, thereby subsequently increases the platinumselicited cellular platinum–DNA adduct formation and
cytotoxicity.

(CI) of desferal with oxaplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin
was 0.51, 0.68, and 0.93 in S3 cells and 1.76, 1.18, and
1.37 in parental SiHa cells, respectively. We further
determined whether the increased sensitivity of S3 cells
toward platinums correlated to the increased the formation
of intracellular platinum–DNA adduct. As the result, the
formation of platinum–DNA adduct significantly increased
in the combination regimens with desferal than platinum
alone in S3 cells; however, this effect did not observe in
parental cells (Figure 1A–1C). Compared with a singledrug treatment, the cotreatment of desferal with oxaliplatin
or cisplatin significantly increased DNA adducts formation
in S3 cells. However, no change in DNA adduct formation
was observed in S3 cells treated either with carboplatin
plus desferal or carboplatin alone (Figure 1D).

Desferal increases the expression of hCtr1 and
TfR1 through the upregulation of Sp1 in S3 cells
To determine the basal level of both hCtr1 and TfR1
proteins in SiHa and S3 cells, western blot analysis was
performed. The results revealed that the expression level
of hCtr1 and TfR1 was higher in SiHa cells than in S3
cells (Figure 2A). Furthermore, we examined the effect
of desferal on intracellular iron and copper concentrations
in both SiHa and S3 cells. As presented in Figure 2B,
desferal treatment significantly reduced more intracellular
iron and copper concentrations in S3 cells than in
SiHa cells (48% vs.17%, P = 0.019; 96% vs.69%, P =
0.012). Previously, we demonstrated that the expression
of hCtr1 is controlled by the transcription factor Sp1,
which is negatively regulated by intracellular copper
concentrations [14]. We further evaluated the effect of
desferal on the expression of Sp1 and hCtr1 in both SiHa
and S3 cells. We observed an increase in the expression of
Sp1 and hCtr1 in the concentration- and time-dependent
manner in S3 cells; however, desferal did not affect Sp1
and hCtr1 in SiHa cells (Figure 2C). Notably, desferal
increased the expression of TfR1 in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 2C). We further investigated whether
the expression of hCtr1 is through the transcriptional
regulation of Sp1 on the hCtr1 promoter in S3 cells. We
observed that desferal treatment induced the binding of
Sp1 to the hCtr1 promoter and increased the expression of
hCtr1 (Figure 2D).

Results
Combination effect of platinum drugs and
desferal on SiHa and S3 cells
Oxaliplatin-resistant cells S3 were established from
SiHa cells by exposure to increasing concentrations of
oxaliplatin. The antiproliferative effect of platinum-based
drugs and desferal in SiHa and S3 cells was illustrated
in Table 1. As compared with parental SiHa cells, S3
cells were more resistant to oxaliplatin, followed by
cisplatin and carboplatin, with the resistance index of
approximately 77.6, 12.7, and 2.7, respectively. However,
the IC50 value of desferal for both SiHa and S3 cells was
almost similar.
To investigate the combination effect of desferal
and platinum-based drugs, both SiHa and S3 cells were
simultaneously treated with desferal and platinum-based
drugs for 72 h. As listed in Table 2, the combination index

pathway
Several studies have reported that Sp1 regulates NF-κB
p65 transcription [15, 16]. As presented in Figure 3A, our
results revealed that desferal increased the expression of
NF-κB p65 in S3 cells. Furthermore, we observed an increase
in the nuclear expression of Sp1 and NF-κB p65 after treating
S3 cells with desferal (Figure 3B). The nuclear accumulation

of NF-κB p65 maybe related to its transcriptional activity
after desferal treatment. Moreover, the activation of NF-κB
p65 in LPS–IFNγ-treated macrophage cells was reported
to be relative to the expression of TfR1 [17]. Therefore, we
analyzed the TfR1 promoter sequence by using the QIAGEN
EpiTect chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) promoter
binding site prediction and observed the presence of
potential NF-κB-binding sites in the TfR1 promoter region.
We hypothesized that the upregulation of TfR1 is through
the regulation of NF-κB p65. We observed that NF-κB p65

p65 were increased in S3 cells treated with desferal
(Figure 3C). However, this effect did not observe in SiHa
cells. In addition, the transcription levels of TfR1 and NF-κB
p65 significantly increased after desferal treatment in S3
cells (Figure 3C). To further determine whether Sp1 is
responsible for the regulation of NF-κB p65 and TfR1
expression, we knocked down Sp1 expression by using a
siRNA followed by treated cell with desferal. As the result,
we found that the silence of Sp1 reduced the expression of
TfR1 in S3 cells in both presence and absence of desferal
conditions (Figure  3D).

TfR1 serves as a transporter for platinum drugs

only in S3 cells after the combination treatment of desferal
with oxaliplatin (Figure 5B). In addition, we observed no
significant body weight loss in these mice (Figure 5A–5B).
We further assessed the expression levels of hCtr1 and
TfR1 in tumor tissues through immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining. Consistent with our in vitro findings,
desferal treatment considerably increased the expression
of hCtr1 and TfR1 in S3 tumors (Figure 5C–5D). Taken
together, our results demonstrate that the combination of
desferal and oxaliplatin is an effective approach to inhibit
the tumor growth in oxaliplatin-refractory tumors.

To investigate whether TfR1 is responsible for the
transportation of platinum-based drugs, we knocked down
the expression of TfR1 by using a siRNA in both SiHa
and S3 cells, followed by treatment with platinum-based
drugs, and subsequently measured platinum–DNA adduct
formation. As presented in Figure 4A, platinum–DNA adduct
formation significantly decreased in both SiHa and S3 cells
after the downregulation of TfR1. We further compared DNA
adduct formation after treatment with platinum-based drugs
in hCtr1 or TfR1 knockdown cells. We observed that the
downregulation of hCtr1 and TfR1 reduced platinum–DNA
adduct formation (Figure 4B). Among them, silencing of
TfR1 is more effective than knockdown of hCtr1 to reduce
platinum–DNA adduct formation.

Discussion
In our previous study, we demonstrated that a
copper-chelating agent could reverse oxaliplatin resistance
through the regulation of the copper importer hCtr1
and exporter ATP7A [14]. We further observed that the
expression level of TfR1 was lower in S3 cells than in
parental cells (Figure 2A). These findings prompted
us to identify iron-chelating agent and investigate the
combination effect of iron chelating agents with platinum
drugs in oxalipaltin resistant tumor models. Indeed, we
noted that desferal, an iron-chelating agent, exhibited
synergistic interaction with oxaliplatin or cisplatin to
inhibit tumor cell growth in oxaliplatin-refractory tumors.
Iron is an essential element for cell replication,
metabolism, and growth. When iron is insufficient, cells
increase TfR1 expression to import more iron into the

Desferal increases the antitumor effect of
oxaliplatin in an oxaliplatin-resistant tumor
xenograft model
Our results support the notion that desferal increases
the uptake of platinum-based drugs, which subsequently
increases DNA adduct formation and sensitizes cells
to death in vitro. We further examined the combination
effect of desferal and oxaliplatin in vivo. Both SiHa and S3
tumor xenograft mouse models were used. Compared with
vehicle controls, oxaliplatin delayed growth of both SiHa
and S3 tumors. However, the antitumor effect increased

cell. Desferal, an iron chelator, is currently used to treat
iron-overload diseases [18, 19]. The potential of desferal
and its analogs in cancer therapy has emerged from the
finding that cancer cells require higher iron concentrations
during DNA synthesis and growth than normal cells do
[20]. Studies have reported that desferal removes iron
from cancer cells and prevents iron uptake by TfR1, thus
exerting the antiproliferative effect [21, 22]. In addition to
its iron-chelating effect, desferal can eliminate free copper.
Van Reyke et al. reported that under optimal conditions,
one mole of desferal is sufficient to reduce three moles
of copper [23]. In an animal study, another iron chelating
drug, deferasirox, increased copper levels by 2-fold in the
kidney compared with those in the tumor. The copper–
deferasirox complex was trapped in the kidney during
the filtration, resulting in a significant increase in copper
levels in the kidney [21, 22]. These findings suggest that
these compounds exhibit multi-chelating activity, which
broadens their antitumor effect alone or in combination
with other anticancer agents. Consistent with these
findings, our data further confirmed that desferal has
multi-chelating activity (Figure 2B), which synergizes
with the effect of platinum-based drugs to treat cancer.
Platinum drugs mainly enter cells through passive
diffusion or endocytosis. The net intracellular level of
platinum drugs is balanced between influx and efflux.
Studies have reported that several transporters have

different functions to regulate the net intracellular level
of platinum drugs [24, 25]. Evidence has indicated that
copper transporters have a crucial role in transporting
platinum drugs into cells [8, 26]. The major copper influx
transporter hCtr1 has been reported to assist the uptake
of CDDP, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin and to regulate
their cytotoxicity in yeast and mammalian cells [27, 28].
Furthermore, two copper efflux transporters, ATP7A and
ATP7B, transport platinum drugs from the cytoplasm into
subcellular compartments, primarily localized to the transGolgi network for subsequent efflux in a similar manner
to their effect on copper [9]. This action reduces the
cytotoxicity of platinum drugs and causes drug resistance.
We have previously demonstrated that the downregulation
of hCtr1 and upregulation of ATP7A render cells resistant
to platinum drugs [29]. In addition to the alteration of
copper transporters, we observed that the expression
level of TfR1 was lower in S3 cells than in parental cells
(Figure 2A). These results prompted us to investigate
whether TfR1 has a role in transporting platinum drugs.
The downregulation of TfR1 by using a siRNA reduced
the formation of intracellular platinum–DNA adduct
(Figure 4A). Moreover, the reduction in DNA adduct
formation was significantly higher in cells treated with
siTfR1 than in cells treated with sihCtr1. This is the first
study to report that TfR1 can transport platinum drugs into
cells, probably with a higher efficiency than that of hCtr1.

promoter assay (P < 0.05).

Consistent with these findings, we observed that
desferal reduced intracellular copper concentrations
and increased Sp1, hCtr1, and TfR1 expression levels
both in a dose- and time-dependent manner in S3 cells
(Figure 2C). Moreover, the ChIP assay revealed that Sp1
increased the binding of Sp1 to hCtr1 promoter regions
and then increased Sp1 and hCtr1 transcription and
translation in S3 cells treated with desferal (Figure 2D).
Cumulative evidence has indicated that Sp1 directly
regulates NF-κB p65 transcription [15, 16]. By using
QIAGEN EpiTectChIP promoter binding site prediction,
we observed two putative NF-κB p65 binding sites on
the TfR1 promoter. We then hypothesized that desferal
affects TfR1 expression by increasing the binding of Sp1
to NF-κB p65 binding sites, which subsequently increases
NF-κB p65 expression and binding to the TfR1 promoter
region. Our results revealed that desferal increased NF-κB
p65 expression in S3 cells (Figure 3A). In addition,
desferal treatment increased the nuclear accumulation of
Sp1 and NF-κB p65 only in S3 cells (Figure 3B). Taken

together, these data confirmed for the first time that an
iron chelator could increase TfR1 expression through the
Sp1–NF-κB–TfR1 axis (Figure 3C and 3D). Compared the
negative control from nuclear extraction assay (Figure 3B)
and ChIP assay (Figure 3C), Sp1 in S3 cells presented the
lower expression than in SiHa cells. Therefore, lower
transcription of Sp1 in S3 cells caused the low expression
of TfR1. Given the previous finding that transferrin
receptor promoter contains several Sp1-like binding
sites [30], in this study we revealed that TfR1 expression
was through the Sp1-NF-kB-TfR1 axis. Therefore, Sp1
may also directly bind transferrin receptor promoter
and collaborate with NF-kB in upregulating transferrin
receptor expression.
We assessed the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin
in combination with or without desferal in human tumor
xenografts in mice. Compared with SiHa tumors, the
combination of oxaliplatin and desferal significantly
increased the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin in S3 tumors
(Figure 5A–5B). Furthermore, IHC analysis revealed that

assay. The effect of desferal on the promoter activity levels of both NF-κB p65 and TfR1 promoters was determined using promoter assay
(P < 0.05). (D) Desferal induced TfR1 expression through the Sp1-dependent pathway. S3 cells were transfected with either scramble

the expression levels of hCtr1 and TfR1 increased only
in S3 tumor tissues treated with desferal (Figure 5C–5D).
These results suggest that desferal restores the sensitivity
of cancer cells to platinum-based drugs through the
upregulation of hCtr1 and TfR1. The transferrin receptor
is responsible for major iron homeostasis and supports
growth of cancer cells [31, 32]. Because malignant
cells have increased transferrin receptor expression, this
receptor is widely considered as an accessible portal for
drug delivery into cancer cells and is becoming a potential
target for cancer therapy [33–35]. A phase 1 clinical study

reported a partial response of 87% after using cisplatinconjugated transferrin to treat patients with advanced
cancers [36]. In addition, Fu et al. reported that in patients
with ovarian cancer refractory to platinum drug treatment,
platinum resistance was overcome through the use of
a copper-lowering agent [37]. In addition to a copper
chelator, our data provide evidence that an iron chelator
can overcome platinum resistance through the regulation
of hCtr1 and TfR1.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the synergistic
killing effect of the combination of desferal and oxaliplatin

of the expression of a copper transporter and transferrin
receptor in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we reported that
the upregulation of transferrin receptor is through the

used in this study was under the assumption of mutual no

Materials and Methods

DNA adduct measurement

Reagents

SiHa and S3 cells were treated with a 1-fold IC50
dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, and cisplatin either alone
or in combination with desferal for 6 h. DNA was extracted
and processed according to manufacturer instructions
(Promega, Madison, USA, A1125). DNA adducts were
measured using ELISA; each sample was coated on a
96-well ELISA plate (Sigma-Aldrich, CLS2525–10EA)
and probed with specific monoclonal ICR4 antibodies
(Millipore, MA, USA, Q2296671) to intrastrand adducts.
For detection, 1-Step Ultra TMBELISA (Thermo
Scientific, Utah, USA, PE1814394) was added to each
sample and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 M
sulfuric acid. The absorption wavelength was measured
at 450 nm by using a microplate reader (Spectramax M5
plate reader, Molecular Devices) [40].

Platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin, cisplatin,
and carboplatin, were obtained from Sanofi (NY, USA,
4F121A), Fresenius Kabi (India, 871QZ01001), and
Pharmachemie B.V. (Haarlem, Netherlands, 12D7MD),
respectively. D-penicillamine (P4875–1G) and desferal
(D9533–1G) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Primary
antibodies, hCtr1 (sc-66847) and NF-κB p65 (sc-109),
were purchased from Santa Cruz (CA, USA); Sp1 (07–645),
α-tubulin (2508783), and TfR1 (ab84036) were purchased
from Millipore Corporation (MA, USA) and Abcam
(MA, USA), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies (sc-2055, sc-2054) were
purchased from Santa Cruz (CA, USA).

Cell lines and culture

Measurement of intracellular iron and copper
concentrations

SiHa parental cells were from ATCC and cultured
in DMEM medium (Thermo Scientific, Utah, USA,
SH30003.02) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(Thermo Scientific, Utah, USA, SH30071.03), 100U/mL
of penicillin, and 100μg/mL of streptomycin–glutamate
(Thermo Scientific, Utah, USA, 10378016) in a 5% CO2
incubator (humidified atmosphere) at 37°C. S3 cells,
an oxaliplatin-resistant subclone of SiHa cells, were
cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL
of streptomycin–glutamate, and 2 μg/mL of oxaliplatin.
For the following assays, resistant cells were cultured in
the medium without oxaliplatin to prevent the interference
caused by oxaliplatin.

SiHa and S3 cell lysates were harvested using a
lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40 and 10% glycerol in phosphatebuffered saline) before desferal or D-penicillamine
treatment for 24 h or without treatment as a control. The
protein concentration of whole-cell lysates was quantified
and iron and copper concentrations were measured using
Perkin Elmer SCIEX ELAN 6100 ICP mass spectrometer
(Shelton, CT, USA).

Small interference RNA transfection
Sp1-, NF-κB p65-, and TfR1-specific human
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from
Invitrogen (Waltham, USA, s13318, s11914, and s727).
siRNA oligonucleotides were introduced into cells by
using the oligofectamine transfection reagent according to
manufacturer instructions.

Cell growth inhibition assay and combination
index
For the cell growth inhibition assay, both SiHa
and S3 cell lines were subjected to desferal, oxaliplatin,
cisplatin, or carboplatin treatment, respectively, for 72 h.
At the end of the treatment, cell growth was measured
using a crystal violet stain assay. Cell growth inhibition
determined by the dose that caused 50% cell death was
designated as IC50. Resistance index was calculated using
the following equation: (IC50 of S3 cells)/(IC50 of SiHa
cells). The CI between desferal and platinum drugs,

Western blot analysis
Cells were initially seeded at a density of 1 × 106 in
100-mm2 dishes. After treatment, cells were lysed using a
cell lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, C2978) with 1 mM DTT,
1 mM PMSF, and a protease inhibitor (Roche, Mannheim,
Deutschland, 04693116001) and vortexed for 3 seconds

B24656/V125742, B26543–1/M76364, and B26543–2/
M76368). In brief, plasmids were introduced into cells
by using the oligofectamine transfection reagent for 24 h
and then processed using the Dual-Luciferase 1000 Assay
system (Promega, Madison, USA, E1910) according to
manufacturer protocol.

then incubated on ice for 1 h. Lysates were centrifuged
at 4°C at 13,200rpm for 15 minutes. After centrifuging,
supernatant was transferred to the new eppendorf.
Further, 100 µg of cell lysates were separated using
10% SDS-PAGE at 100 v and were then transferred on
polyvinylidinedifluoride membranes. The target proteins
were probed with specific primary antibodies and HRPconjugated secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive
bands were detected using the ECL method and visualized
on Kodak Bio-MAX MR film.

Nuclear extraction assay
Samples were lysed using 500μL of buffer A
(10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM
DTT, and 0.05% NP-40; pH 7.9). After centrifugation at
3,000 rpm for 10min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected
as a cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed three times
with a wash buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and
10  mM KCl; pH 7.9) and then lysed using 450 μL of
buffer B (5 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA,
0.5 mM DTT, 26% glycerol, and 300 mM NaCl; pH 7.9).
The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at
13,200 rpm for 20min at 4°C as a nuclear fraction. 100 µg
of cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to gel
electrophoresis and analyzed through immunoblotting.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR
SiHa and S3 cells were treated with or without
desferal for 24 h and then were crosslinked with 37%
formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were then
harvested and processed for DNA fragmentation through
sonication on ice. The resultant chromatin–DNA fractions
were purified using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore, 2487694)
according to manufacturer instructions. Chromatin was
immunoprecipitated at 4°C by using anti-Sp1, antiNF-κB p65, and normal IgG (negative control). Primer
sequences used were as follows: Sp1 on Sp1 promoter:
forward
5′-CTTGGAGAGCAAGCGAGTCT-3′,
reverse 5′-TGGACTCATCCTTACCGCTC-3′; Sp1
on hCtr1 promoter: forward 5′-CGGTCTCTGGACCGA
AAGTA-3′, reverse 5′-CTCCGAATCTTAACCCGTCA-3′;
Sp1 on NF-κB p65 promoter: forward 5′-AACTAATA
ATAGGCCGGGCG-3′, reverse 5′-CGTGTTAGCCAGG
ATGGTTT-3′; and NF-κB p65 on TfR1 promoter: forward
5′-CTGCTTCTTGAGGGAAAACG-3′, reverse 5′-TTAGG
GGAGAACGCATCTGA-3′.

Animal experiments and immunohistochemistry
study
All the animal experiments were conducted
according to the protocols of the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (American Association for Laboratory
Animal Science). The male athymic (NCR nu/nu) nude
mice (aged 3–4 wk) were housed in a pathogen-free
environment. Animals were subcutaneously inoculated
on the dorsal lumbosacral region with 1 × 107 SiHa cells
or 2 × 107 S3 cells in a total volume of 100 μL with a
growth-factor-reduced basement membrane. When the
tumor volume reached 70–100 mm3, the animals were
randomly divided into four groups, with 5 animals in each
group. The mice were treated with indicated chemicals and
drugs through a tail vein injection three times a week for
subsequent 3 weeks. During the treatment, tumor volume
and weight were evaluated three times per week. The
tumor masses were removed on the fifth week of the study
and were subjected to IHC staining procedures.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was extracted from SiHa and S3 cell
lines by using TRIzol® reagent (Thermo Fisher, 74108).
First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Super Script
III first strand synthesis system according to manufacturer
instructions. The transcription level of Sp1, hCtr1, NFκB p65, and TfR1 was quantified using the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR system, with RPL13A as
an internal control. Primer sequences used were as follows:
hCtr1: forward 5′-AAGGGTGGTGGAATAATTGCAG-3′,
reverse 5′-CTCACGAACTTGTGCCAGTAG-3′; Sp1:
forward 5′-AGTTCCAGACCGTTGATGGG-3′, reverse
5′-GTTTGCACCTGGTATGATCTGT-3′; NFκB p65:
forward 5′- GCAGAGGGGAATGCGTTTTAG-3′, reverse
5′-AGAAGGGTATGTTCGGTTGTTG-3′; and TfR1:
forward
5′-ACCATTGTCATATACCCGGTTCA-3′,
reverse 5′-CAATAGCCCAAGTAGCCAATCAT-3′.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to analyze the quantitative
and statistical results. All data were carried out in triplicate
and expressed as a mean and standard deviation (SD). A
P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
