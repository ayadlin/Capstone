Abstract
The discovery of somatic mutations in EGFR and development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have
revolutionized treatment for lung cancer. However, resistance to TKIs emerges in almost all patients and
currently no effective treatment is available. Here, we show that b-catenin is essential for development of EGFRmutated lung cancers. b-Catenin was upregulated and activated in EGFR-mutated cells. Mutant EGFR preferentially bound to and tyrosine phosphorylated b-catenin, leading to an increase in b-catenin–mediated
transactivation, particularly in cells harboring the geﬁtinib/erlotinib-resistant gatekeeper EGFR-T790M mutation.
Pharmacologic inhibition of b-catenin suppressed EGFR-L858R-T790M mutated lung tumor growth, and genetic
deletion of the b-catenin gene dramatically reduced lung tumor formation in EGFR-L858R-T790M transgenic
mice. These data suggest that b-catenin plays an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and that targeting the
b-catenin pathway may provide novel strategies to prevent lung cancer development or overcome resistance to
EGFR TKIs. Cancer Res; 74(20); 5891–902. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide
(1). The conventional treatment of advanced lung cancer is
unsatisfactory; however, the discovery of EGFR somatic kinase
mutations provided the ﬁrst glimpse of aberrant tyrosine
kinase oncogene function in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Activating EGFR mutations (i.e., exon 19 deletions
or the exon 21 L858R) are present in 10% to 40% of NSCLCs
depending on race, gender, and smoking status (2). These
mutations trigger the EGFR signaling pathway and promote
EGFR-mediated prosurvival and antiapoptotic signals (2).
Most NSCLCs with activating EGFR mutations respond dra-

matically to geﬁtinib and erlotinib, which are reversible EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, almost all patients
demonstrate progressive tumors within 2 years of continued
drug exposure. The secondary EGFR-T790M mutation
accounts for more than 50% of acquired resistance to geﬁtinib
and erlotinib (2). Irreversible and second-generation EGFR
inhibitors can partially overcome NSCLCs with T790M in vitro
(3). This knowledge has spawned clinical trials of neratinib (4)
and afatinib (5) in this patient population. However, these
"second-generation" inhibitors alone have not led to signiﬁcant
control of tumors with acquired resistance to geﬁtinib/erlotinib (4, 5). Thus, novel strategies to overcome the acquired
resistance caused by T790M either by developing inhibitors
speciﬁc to EGFR-T790M (6) or by developing inhibitors of
T790M downstream targets are sorely needed.
b-Catenin plays two major roles in normal cell homeostasis: it is a component of cell–cell adhesion structures and also
a key player in the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. As a cell
adhesion molecule, membranous b-catenin links E-cadherin
to a-catenin. In the nucleus, b-catenin acts as a transcriptional activator in conjunction with the TCF/LEF DNA-binding proteins and regulates its target genes that are responsible
for cellular proliferation and differentiation (7). In the
absences of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, b-catenin is degraded
by the destruction complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b). However, aberrant activation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway can trigger tumorigenesis in several organs. In patients
with familial adenomatous polyposis, mutations in APC lead
to loss of APC function, stabilization of b-catenin, and constitutive activation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway (8). In lung
cancer, there is accumulating evidence that Wnt/b-catenin

may be activated; however, mutations in APC are uncommon
(9). Recently, it has been shown that this pathway plays an
important role in lung adenocarcinoma metastasis (10), but
the role of b-catenin signaling in NSCLC initiation/progression is not well understood.
In addition to serine/threonine phosphorylation, b-catenin can be tyrosine phosphorylated by several tyrosine
kinases including Src (11, 12) and EGFR (13). In physiologic
conditions, tyrosine-phosphorylation of b-catenin leads to
dissociation of b-catenin from b-catenin/a-catenin/E-cadherin complexes, its stabilization with subsequent nuclear
translocation, and ﬁnally increased transactivation of
b-catenin (14). Moreover, it has been shown that b-catenin
can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated by oncogenic Bcr-Abl or
FLT3-mutant proteins, leading to its increased protein stability and transcriptional signaling activity (15, 16). These
data strongly suggest that constitutively activated oncogenic
kinases may contribute to cancer initiation and/or progression by increasing b-catenin activity.
In this study, we show that b-catenin is stabilized and
activated through tyrosine-phosphorylation by mutant EGFRs.
Inhibition of b-catenin was shown to suppress lung tumor
growth in vitro and in vivo. Conditional deletion of the b-catenin gene (Ctnnb1) inhibited lung tumor formation induced by
EGFR-L858R-T790M in transgenic mice. These data indicate
that b-catenin plays an essential role on mutant EGFR-induced
lung tumorigenesis.

Role of b-Catenin in Mutant EGFR-Induced Lung Cancer

conventional IHC analyses, four EGFR-mutated NSCLC
patients (L858R and exon 19 deletion) with acquired geﬁtinib
resistance were analyzed. They underwent CT-guided pre- and
posttreatment biopsies of their tumors at Keio University
Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. All tissues
were embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). IHC staining was performed on
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn sections. All cases for quantitation of
nuclear b-catenin staining were reviewed in a blinded fashion.
For murine studies, mice were sacriﬁced and lungs were ﬁxed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The antibodies used were:
b-catenin (human, R&D Systems or DAKO; mouse, BD Transduction Laboratories); axin2 (Abcam); and TTF1 (Abcam). Xgal staining was performed as described (28).
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Cells were plated in 6-well plates overnight and transfected
with 1.5 mg pcDNA3.1-EGFR and 1.5 mg FLAG-tagged pcDNA3b-catenin. Cells were incubated overnight and trypsinized the
following day. Cells were then plated into the 2-well chamber
slides, incubated overnight, and stained with the following
antibodies: FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich); b-catenin (BD Transduction
Laboratories); Alexa 594-mouse and 488-rabbit (Invitrogen).
In vitro and in vivo drug treatment
For cell culture studies, both afatinib (LC Laboratory) and
ICG-001 (Selleck Chemicals) were reconstituted in DMSO and
used at the indicated concentrations. For in vivo studies, ICG001 was suspended in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose (SigmaAldrich) and administered intraperitoneally at 150 mg/kg/day.
The stock solution was reconstituted every week and stored at
4 C. The same mice were imaged by MRI to determine the
reduction in tumor volume after 2 to 3 weeks during the
respective treatments.
Cell proliferation assay
Growth inhibition was assessed by CellTiter 96 AQueous
One solution proliferation kit (Promega) according to the
manufacturer's instruction.
Colony formation assay
Anchorage-independent growth was assayed as previously
described (29). A total of 5,000 cells were plated and colonies
were counted after 14 days.
MRI scanning
All MRI was performed with a 4.7 Tesla Biospec 47/40
spectrometer using a birdcage radio-frequency coil with an
inner-diameter of 30 mm (Bruker Instruments). Detailed procedure of MRI scanning was described previously (17). On each
MRI image, areas indicating the pulmonary tumor were manually segmented and measured to calculate tumor volumes
using NIH ImageJ software (version 1.46; http://rsb.info.nih.
gov/ij/).
Statistical analysis
Differences between the experimental groups were tested
with Fisher exact test, Student t test, or Wilcoxon signed-rank

test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate
overall survival. We performed our statistical analyses with
STATA version 12.1 (STATA Corp).

Results
b-Catenin is overexpressed in cells with EGFR activating
mutations
We previously identiﬁed cyclin D1 as one of the major
effectors downstream of EGFR with activating mutations
(23). As cyclin D1 is one of the target genes of the Wnt/
b-catenin signaling pathway (7), we asked whether the pathway is activated in EGFR mutant cells. As shown in Fig. 1A,
expression of b-catenin was increased in all EGFR-mutant cells
at similar levels to A427 cells carrying a b-catenin stabilizing
mutation (30), compared with cells harboring wild-type EGFR.
In addition, immunoﬂuorescence studies using confocal laser
scanning microscopy showed much brighter signals in cells
with EGFR mutations (NCI-H1650 and NCI-H1975; Fig. 1B) as
compared with A549 cells, which carry wild-type EGFR. Interestingly, b-catenin was detected not only on the cell membrane, but also in the cytoplasm and nucleus in cells with EGFR
mutants. Conversely, it was localized on the cell surface and
sites of cell–cell contact in A549 cells (Fig. 1B). These results
prompted us to determine expression and localization of
b-catenin in mutant EGFR-driven tumors in vivo. We have
previously established the lung-speciﬁc conditional EGFRL858R-T790M (EGFRTL) transgenic mice containing seven
direct repeats of the tetracycline (tet)-operator sequence.
These mice were crossed with CCSP-rtTA mice, which specifically express the reverse tetracycline transactivator protein
(rtTA) in CCSP expressing cells (17). Consistent with our
previous report (17), lung tumors were detected in EGFRTL/
CCSP-rtTA mice treated with doxycycline but not in CCSP-rtTA
mice (Fig. 1C: I and V). These tumors were positive for thyroid
transcription factor-1 (TTF-1; Fig. 1C: VI). More than 70% of
tumor cells were positive for cytoplasmic b-catenin, whereas
nuclear b-catenin was positive in approximately 20% of tumor
cells (Fig. 1C: VII; arrows). Interestingly, cytoplasmic Axin2,
which is a direct target gene of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway
(31), was detected in almost all tumor cells (Fig. 1C: VIII), which
indicates that b-catenin is indeed activated in EGFR-mutant
tumor cells.
EGFR mutants increase expression and activity of
b-catenin
Next, we investigated the effects of mutant EGFR on stability
and localization of b-catenin. When 293T cells were cotransfected with constructs containing b-catenin and either wildtype EGFR, EGFR-L858R, or EGFR-L858R-T790M, expression of
cytosolic and nuclear b-catenin was highest in cells transfected
with EGFR-L858R-T790M (Fig. 2A). Lower expression of b-catenin was detected in cells transfected with EGFR-L858R, but the
expression was still at higher level compared with cells transfected with wild-type EGFR (Fig. 2A). Next, to examine the
effect of EGFR mutants on b-catenin localization, we generated
stable cell lines expressing either wild-type EGFR, EGFR-L858R,
or EGFR-L858R-T790M (Fig. 2B) using human immortalized

bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B; ref. 32). Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that expression of nuclear b-catenin was highest in BEAS-2B cells expressing EGFR-L858RT790M. Although cytoplasmic b-catenin was increased in
BEAS-2B cells expressing EGFR-L858R, expression of nuclear
b-catenin was modest compared with BEAS-2B cells expressing wild-type EGFR (Fig. 2C). As nuclear translocation of
b-catenin is required for its transcriptional activity, we
attempted to determine whether activated EGFR mutants
enhance transactivation using the TCF optimal promoter,
luciferase reporter (pTOPFLASH; ref. 24). The luciferase reporter containing the mutant motif (pFOPFLASH) was used to
measure background activity. As shown in Fig. 2D, the TCF/
LEF transactivation was highest in cells transiently transfected

5894

with EGFR-L858R-T790M, whereas cells transfected with EGFRL858R showed slightly, but signiﬁcantly, enhanced transactivation compared with cells transfected with wild-type EGFR.
Furthermore, to detect transactivation of b-catenin directly
in lung tumor, we crossed EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA mice to TOP
galactosidase (TOPGAL) reporter mice (20). In this system,
expression of b-galactosidase is mediated by TCF/LEF transactivation. IHC analysis showed that b-galactosidase was
strongly positive in lung tumors isolated from EGFRTL/
CCSP-rtTA/TOPGAL mice (Fig. 2E: V), whereas no staining was
detected in EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA mice (Fig. 2E: III). Consistent
with these data, X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactoside) staining demonstrated b-galactosidase activity in lung
tumors isolated from EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/TOPGAL mice

Alveolar cells were weakly positive for both b-galactosidase

activated in EGFR-mutated lung tumors and imply that EGFR

more intense and there were signiﬁcantly more nuclear staining-positive cells in posttreatment tumors than pretreated
tumors (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that b-catenin is
upregulated and activated in human NSCLC specimens and
suggest that emergence of T790M may increase b-catenin
activity.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of b-catenin is mediated by
EGFR mutants and enhances its activity
To investigate the mechanism of b-catenin stabilization, we
ﬁrst examined whether EGFR mutants enhance GSK3b phosphorylation. Although levels of b-catenin were higher in cells
transfected with mutant EGFR than in cells with wild-type
EGFR, phosphorylation of GSK3b (serine 9) was not increased
(Fig. 4A). These results suggest that GSK3b is not solely
responsible for stabilization of b-catenin.
It has been shown that tyrosine-phosphorylation of b-catenin enhances its stabilization, nuclear translocation, and/or
transcriptional activity (11–13). As EGFR-L858R and L858RT790M show high levels of constitutive tyrosine kinase activity
(3, 33), we ﬁrst asked whether EGFR mutants tyrosine-phosphorylate b-catenin. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that EGFR mutants preferentially bound to and
proportionally tyrosine-phosphorylated b-catenin (Fig. 4B).
Phosphorylation and binding to EGFR were inhibited by both
erlotinib and afatinib in cells transfected with EGFR-L858R, but
only by afatinib in cells with EGFR-L858R-T790M (Fig. 4C).
Given that irreversible inhibitors such as afatinib can inhibit
phosphorylation of both EGFR-L858R and EGFR-L858RT790M in vitro (3), these data indicate that EGFR mutants
bind to and tyrosine-phosphorylate b-catenin. Furthermore,
inhibition of EGFR-mediated tyrosine-phosphorylation of
b-catenin by afatinib resulted in less accumulation of b-catenin
in the nucleus (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting
that tyrosine-phosphorylation of b-catenin by EGFR mutants,

Next, we investigated whether tyrosine-phosphorylation of
b-catenin leads to an increase in its activity. We focused on

phorylated and translocated into the nucleus in this model.
Transactivation of b-catenin was inhibited by afatinib, which
inhibits EGFR-L858R-T790M kinase activity (Fig. 4E). b-catenin is phosphorylated at Y86 by Src and oncogenic Bcr-Abl
(15, 34) and at Y654 by activated wild-type EGFR (35) and
oncogenic FLT3-ITD (16). On the basis of the structural
similarity in the tyrosine kinase domain of various oncogenes
(36), we hypothesized that Y86 and Y654 residues of b-catenin
would be phosphorylated by EGFR mutants and affect activation of b-catenin. b-Catenin Y333, which has been shown to be
phosphorylated by Src and bound to PKM, resulting in nuclear
translocation of b-catenin (12), was also tested. We created
single b-catenin Y-to-F mutants (Y86F, Y654F, and Y333F), plus
the double-mutant Y86FþY654F. All b-catenin Y-to-F mutants
showed lower levels of tyrosine-phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4) and decreased transactivation (Fig. 4F) compared
with wild-type b-catenin, again suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylation of b-catenin by EGFR mutants plays an important
part for transactivation. Interestingly, Y333F had little impact
on tyrosine-phosphorylation and transactivation of b-catenin
(Fig. 4F). These results are consistent with the transactivation
assay, which showed that SU6656, a Src inhibitor, failed to
inhibit nuclear translocation (Fig. 4D) and transactivation of
b-catenin (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results suggest that
tyrosine-phosphorylation of b-catenin by EGFR mutants, but
not Src, contributes in part to its stabilization, translocation,
and transactivation.
Inhibition of b-catenin suppresses tumor growth
On the basis of our observations that b-catenin is constitutively activated downstream of mutant EGFR-L858R-T790M,
we hypothesized that inhibition of b-catenin would lead to
suppression of tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, we
generated b-catenin knockdown cells using NCI-H1975 cells
harboring EGFR-L858R-T790M (Fig. 5A). Soft agar colony formation assay demonstrated that the number of colonies was
signiﬁcantly suppressed in b-catenin knockdown NCI-H1975
cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we
used ICG-001, a small molecule that speciﬁcally blocks the

CBP–b-catenin interaction (37). Treatment with ICG-001 led to
suppression of AXIN2 (Fig. 5C) and suppressed cell growth in
NCI-H1975 cells. ICG-001 failed to suppress NCI-H460 cell
growth harboring wild-type EGFR (Fig. 5D). Interestingly,
AXIN2 was not suppressed at this concentration in NCIH460 cells (Fig. 5C). These in vitro results prompted us to
model the effects of ICG-001 in lung tumors in the EGFRTL/
CCSP-rtTA mice described above. Although the body weight
changes showed no signiﬁcant difference between two groups,
there was a trend toward kept body weight in ICG-001 treatment group, which may support the notion that ICG-001
treatment was effective against cachexia by suppressing
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5). MRI studies demonstrated
that ICG-001 signiﬁcantly suppressed tumor growth when
compared with the control treatment (Fig. 5E and F).

Deletion of Ctnnb1 signiﬁcantly inhibits lung tumor
formation
Next, we sought to determine whether b-catenin plays an
important role in lung cancer development induced by EGFR
mutants. To test this hypothesis, we generated a lung cancer
mouse model in which Ctnnb1 can be conditionally deleted. We
crossed EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA, teto-Cre (38) and conditional
b-catenin knockout mice (Ctnnb1F/; ref. 19). In the resultant
mice, EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/teto-Cre/Ctnnb1F/F mice (Fig. 6A;
genotype is shown in Supplementary Fig. S6A), cre recombination, and induction of mutated proteins (EGFR-L858RT790M) occurred selectively in pulmonary epithelial cells
with doxycycline treatment (39). MRI studies demonstrated
that no or signiﬁcantly smaller tumors were detected in
EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/teto-Cre/Ctnnb1F/F mice compared with

from control mice, whereas lungs from EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/

(EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/teto-Cre/Ctnnb1F/F) signiﬁcantly inhibited

(Supplementary Fig. S7A). Interestingly, when we isolated
these histologically detectable tumors by laser capture microdissection in EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/teto-Cre/Ctnnb1F/F mice, we
found that b-catenin was not excised in most of these tumors
[67% (8/12); Supplementary Fig. S7B]. Regardless of these small
tumors, EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/teto-Cre/Ctnnb1F/F mice showed signiﬁcantly longer survival (P < 0.001) than EGFRTL/CCSP-rtTA/
teto-Cre/Ctnnb1F/þ mice (Fig. 6E). Taken together, these
observations suggest that b-catenin is required for lung
tumor initiation and/or development induced by EGFRL858R-T790M.

EGFR-mutated NSCLC; however, acquired resistance to TKIs
is an inevitable consequence of tumor selection over

continuous drug pressure. The EGFR-T790M mutation has
emerged as the major mechanism of resistance to erlotinib
and geﬁtinib. Although irreversible EGFR inhibitors are effective in lung cancer cells with EGFR-T790M mutation in vitro (3),
clinical trials of these same compounds, such as afatinib or
neratinib, have been disappointing (4, 5). Therefore, in addition
to ongoing efforts to develop EGFR-T790M selective inhibitors,
elucidating the precise mechanisms by which oncogenic EGFR
mutations initiate and induce progressive lung tumors should
be part of the research strategy to overcome and prevent
resistance to clinically available EGFR TKIs. In this study, we
demonstrated that b-catenin is required for tumor development and progression induced by TKI-sensitive or -resistant
EGFR mutants. Our results give strong evidence for crosstalk

www.aacrjournals.org

between the oncogenic EGFR signaling and Wnt/b-catenin
signaling for lung tumorigenesis.
Our data show that b-catenin is upregulated and translocated into nucleus in cells harboring EGFR mutants, particularly EGFR-T790M. Nuclear translocation of b-catenin is a
hallmark of activation of b-catenin signaling, and indeed,
b-catenin is activated in EGFR-mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 2D)
and in vivo (Fig. 2E). Our observations are supported by
previous observations that b-catenin-TCF/LEF target genes
such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc are upregulated in NSCLC
harboring EGFR-T790M (23, 40). Inhibition of serine/threonine
phosphorylation by GSK3b is a well-recognized mechanism of
b-catenin stabilization (8). However, our data demonstrate
that this may not be a sole mechanism of b-catenin

upregulation in mutant EGFR-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). It has
been shown that tyrosine-phosphorylation contributes to activation of b-catenin (14) and our data suggest that EGFR
mutants preferentially bound to and tyrosine-phosphorylate
b-catenin, and modulate its activity. However, it is possible that
other mechanism(s) is involved in b-catenin activation. For
example, it has been reported that methylation is detected in
the APC promoter region in 96% of primary lung cancer tissues
and hypermethylation is associated with poor survival (41, 42).
Thus, methylation of the APC promoter can occur in EGFRmutated tumors and affect b-catenin activity in EGFR-mutated
tumors. Future studies are required to uncover the precise
mechanisms of b-catenin activation.
It is noteworthy to highlight that expression and activity of
b-catenin, as well as tyrosine-phosphorylation of b-catenin, are
enhanced in EGFR mutants bearing T790M than EGFR
mutants with the classical sensitizing L858R mutation alone.
Although a signiﬁcant difference between wild-type EGFR
tumors and EGFR-sensitizing mutant tumors was found, only
less than 20% of EGFR-sensitizing mutant tumors were positive for nuclear b-catenin in our tissue microarray analysis
(Fig. 3A). Given that less nuclear b-catenin was detected in cells
with EGFR-L858R than ones with EGFR-L858R-T790M (Fig. 2A
and C), one explanation may be that the tissue microarray
sample set did not include tumors harboring EGFR-T790M.
Interestingly, when lung tumors became resistant to erlotinib/
geﬁtinib due to emergence of EGFR-T790M, an increase in the
number of nuclear b-catenin–positive cells was observed in our
small size analysis (16.2% in pretreatment vs. 36.3% in
posttreatment: Fig. 3B and supplementary Fig. S2). Large-scale
analysis will be required to further elucidate the role of
b-catenin pathway in emergence of EGFR-T790M and resistance to EGFR TKIs.
On the basis of the observations that b-catenin activity
was upregulated by EGFR-T790M, one can speculate that
increased activation of b-catenin alone can lead to, or at
least contribute to, resistance to EGFR TKIs. Interestingly,
somatic mutations of b-catenin with concomitant EGFRT790M mutation have been detected in 5% of EGFR TKIresistant tumors in one series (43) and in vitro overexpression of b-catenin (or expression of activated form of b-catenin) leads to resistant to reversible EGFR TKIs in EGFRmutant cell lines lacking the T790M mutation (44, 45).
Furthermore, acquired resistance to TKIs in EGFR-mutant
cells that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition can
be concurrently seen with b-catenin signaling activation
(46). Therefore, b-catenin modulation can be a means to
overcome or delay resistance to geﬁtinib, erlotinib, or other
EGFR TKIs. In this report, we demonstrate that ICG-001
suppressed lung tumor growth in EGFR-T790M bearing in
vivo preclinical models (Fig. 5). However, we note that ICG001 failed to completely eradicate tumors or achieve perfect
downstream inhibition. The doses used in our study did not
seem to be toxic (Supplementary Fig. S5) and it is certainly
possible that serum concentration did not reach the levels
that inhibit b-catenin-CBP binding in vivo. More efﬁcient
b-catenin inhibitors will be required for further preclinical
studies and subsequent clinical development.

The model of cooperation between EGFR mutants and
b-catenin in lung tumors enhances the knowledge that the
b-catenin pathway is involved in oncogene kinase-driven
tumors. Mouse models of Kras G12D have demonstrated that
activation of Wnt/b-catenin accelerates tumor development
by converting bronchial clara cells to more proliferative embryonic progenitor cells (47). In addition, activating mutations of
Ctnnb1 and mutations of Fgfr3 cooperatively induce lung
tumors (48). Gene expression analysis of clinical lung cancer
samples has identiﬁed that activation of Wnt/b-catenin is
critical for tumor metastasis (10). Our own conditional knockout model clearly suggests that b-catenin plays a signiﬁcant
role on lung tumorigenesis induced by EGFR-L858R-T790M
because both deletion of b-catenin gene and induction of
EGFR-L858R-T790M occur in the same cells (Fig. 6). Given
that expression of an activated b-catenin alone causes lung
tumors in none (47) or only a small subset of mice (49), it is
predicted that tumor initiation likely requires concomitant
genetic alterations in addition to activation of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling. One possible explanation is that activation of b-catenin by EGFR mutants may "prime" pulmonary cells to be
susceptible to other downstream signaling aberrations and
subsequent transformation into tumor cells. Indeed, it has
been shown that expression of activated b-catenin leads to
expansion of lung-speciﬁc progenitor cells (50).
In this study, we used the EGFR-L858R-T790M inducible
mouse model to show that b-catenin plays an essential role in
lung tumor development in vivo. Although b-catenin was most
stabilized (Fig. 4A) and activated (Fig. 2D) in cells harboring
EGFR-L858R-T790M, EGFR-L858R was still a more potent
activator of b-catenin (Fig. 2D) than wild-type EGFR. Therefore, the question remains as to whether activation of b-catenin is speciﬁc for EGFR-T790M or also important for tumor
development by non-T790M mutants such as EGFR-L858R.
Furthermore, it is still unclear whether b-catenin is activated in
lung tumors driven by other oncogenic kinases. b-catenin can
also be tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by oncogenic
Bcr-Abl or FLT3-mutant proteins in leukemia (15, 16). Therefore, it is possible that other oncogenic receptor tyrosine
kinases such as EML4-ALK translocations may also activate
b-catenin. Future studies are required to answer these
questions.
In summary, we demonstrate that b-catenin is involved in
and required for lung tumor formation induced by EGFR
mutants. These results uncover the mechanisms by which
EGFR mutants lead to lung tumorigenesis and suggest that
modulation of the b-catenin activity could be a novel therapeutic approach not only to inhibit lung cancer development,
but also to overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs.
