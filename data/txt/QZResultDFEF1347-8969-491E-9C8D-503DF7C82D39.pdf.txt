Abstract
Synovial sarcoma is a soft-tissue malignancy characterized by a reciprocal t(X;18) translocation encoding a
chimeric transcriptional modiﬁer. Several receptor tyrosine kinases have been found activated in synovial
sarcoma; however, no convincing therapeutic concept has emerged from these ﬁndings. On the basis of the
results of phosphokinase screening arrays, we here investigate the functional and therapeutic relevance of the
SRC kinase in synovial sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry of phosphorylated SRC and its regulators CSK and
PTP1B (PTPN1) was conducted in 30 synovial sarcomas. Functional aspects of SRC, including dependence of
SRC activation on the SS18/SSX fusion proteins, were analyzed in vitro. Eventually, synovial sarcoma
xenografts were treated with the SRC inhibitor dasatinib in vivo. Activated phospho (p)-(Tyr416)-SRC was
detected in the majority of tumors; dysregulation of CSK or PTP1B was excluded as the reason for the
activation of the kinase. Expression of the SS18/SSX fusion proteins in T-REx-293 cells was associated with
increased p-(Tyr416)-SRC levels, linked with an induction of the insulin-like growth factor pathway.
Treatment of synovial sarcoma cells with dasatinib led to apoptosis and inhibition of cellular proliferation,
associated with reduced phosphorylation of FAK (PTK2), STAT3, IGF-IR, and AKT. Concurrent exposure of
cells to dasatinib and chemotherapeutic agents resulted in additive effects. Cellular migration and invasion
were dependent on signals transmitted by SRC involving regulation of the Rho GTPases Rac and RhoA.
Treatment of nude mice with SYO-1 xenografts with dasatinib signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In
summary, SRC is of crucial biologic importance and represents a promising therapeutic target in synovial
sarcoma. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2518–28. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Synovial sarcomas account for 5% to 10% of all soft-tissue
sarcomas. In the majority, synovial sarcoma arise mainly in
adolescents and young adults with predominance in male
gender. They are molecularly characterized by a reciprocal

t(X; 18) translocation, which juxtaposes the SS18 gene on
chromosome 18 to either the SSX1, the SSX2, or rarely to the
SSX4 gene on the X chromosome. The SS18/SSX chimeric
proteins act as transcriptional coactivators, leading to deregulation of oncogenic pathways (1–3).
Current treatment protocols for synovial sarcoma are based
on radical surgery and standardized chemo- and radiotherapy;
however, prognosis is still poor in advanced disease (4). Targeted therapeutic approaches, which have signiﬁcantly
improved the clinical course of patients with gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST) or dermatoﬁbrosarcoma protuberans,
are still lacking for synovial sarcomas (5, 6). Several receptor
tyrosine kinases have been shown to be expressed in synovial
sarcomas, including the EGF receptor (EGFR; ref. 7) and the
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR; ref. 8), leading to
an activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (9). Non–
receptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the SRC family
kinases (SFK), are important in tumor cell growth, survival, and
motility in different tumor entities, including mesenchymal
tumors as osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma (10).
The 60-kDa human c-SRC (SRC) tyrosine kinase contains 2
phosphorylation sites regulating its enzymatic activity. Phosphorylation at Tyr527 leads to a reduced activity, whereas

SRC Signaling in Synovial Sarcoma

autophosphorylation at Tyr416 is associated with full kinase
activity (11, 12). SRC phosphorylation status is modulated by
the c-SRC tyrosine kinase (CSK) and the protein tyrosine
phosphatase PTP1B, which modify SRC phosphorylation at
Tyr527 (12, 13). CSK has been reported to be critical for SRC
deregulation in colon cancer cells (14). Among the PTPs,
PTP1B has been shown to be of particular importance, being
overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines with elevated
SRC activity (15–17). Different receptor tyrosine kinases
including the IGF-IR and effectors of the PIK3/AKT, RAS/
MAPK, and STAT3 pathways represent important interaction
partners of SRC, leading to cellular survival and proliferation.
Furthermore, SRC is capable of modulating cell migration and
invasion through interaction with integrins, the focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), and regulators of the family of Rho-GTPases
(18, 19).
The present study was conducted to analyze the functional
relevance of SRC signaling in synovial sarcoma biology and
to test its potential as a target for innovative therapeutic
approaches.

Materials and Methods
Patients, tumor samples, and cell lines
Thirty cases of synovial sarcoma were analyzed comprising 22 monophasic and 8 biphasic tumors. Approval of the
study by the Ethical Committee of the University of Bonn
Medical Center (Bonn, Germany) was obtained. FISH or PCR
analyses were used to conﬁrm the diagnosis of synovial
sarcoma revealing a t(X; 18) translocation as described
before (20). The synovial sarcoma cell lines CME-1, 1273/
99, FUJI, SYO-1 (all carrying a SS18/SSX2 translocation), and
HS-SY-II (carrying a SS18/SSX1-translocation) have been
described earlier (21–25); presence of the SS18/SSX translocation was conﬁrmed by PCR using primers speciﬁc for the
translocation subtypes.
Phosphokinase arrays
1273/99 (SS18/SSX2-translocated) and HS-SY-II (SS18/SSX1translocated) cells were grown for 48 hours in medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Protein extraction and phosphokinase arrays (R&D Systems), comprising spotted antibodies for
46 kinase phosphorylation sites, were conducted as indicated
by the manufacturer. Filter development was conducted using
the ECL Kit (Amersham) as described before (26). Densitometric analysis was conducted using the ImageJ software
(http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).
Immunohistochemistry
PTP1B and CSK antibodies were purchased from Abcam, the
p-(Ser10)-histone H3 antibody from Merck Millipore, and p(Tyr416)-SRC, p-(Tyr527)-SRC and cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175)
antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies. Tissue specimens
(including xenografts) were ﬁxed in 4% buffered formaldehyde
and embedded in parafﬁn. After antigen retrieval (10 mmol/L
sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, microwave 600 W, 10 minutes)
PTP1B, CSK, p-(Ser10)-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3
(Asp175) immunohistochemical stainings were conducted
on 4-mm sections with an Autostainer (DAKO) or manually

[p-(Tyr416)-SRC and p-(Tyr527)-SRC]. For PTP1B and CSK,
the antigen–antibody binding was visualized with the avidin–
biotin complex (ABC method) using AEC (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol) or 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen. For
p-(Tyr416)-SRC and p-(Tyr527)-SRC stainings, the Catalyzed
Signal Ampliﬁcation System (CSA II; DAKO) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions using DAB as
chromogen. Positive and negative control stainings using an
appropriate rabbit IgG subtype (DCS) were included. For all
proteins, cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity
were assessed using a semiquantitative score (negative, weak,
moderate, strong) deﬁning the staining intensity in the positive
control (invasive ductal breast cancer/intraductal breast
cancer) as strong.
SS18/SSX fusion gene overexpression in T-REx-293 cells
T-REx-293 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and cultured in Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed Eagles' Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 5 mg/mL
blasticidin. SS18/SSX1, SS18/SSX2, SS18, SSX1, and SSX2 were
ampliﬁed by PCR using templates expression vectors described
before (27, 28). The cDNAs were then cloned into the tetracycline-regulated pTREx DEST30 Gateway expression vector
(Invitrogen). Using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, T-REx-293
cells were transfected with expression vectors for SS18/SSX1,
SS18/SSX2, SS18, SSX1, and SSX2, respectively, and the pT-REx/
GW-30/lacZ vector (Invitrogen) expressing b-galactosidase
was included as control. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
T–REx–293 cells were selected in culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/mL geneticin (G418), and drug-resistant colonies were isolated after 6 weeks of selection. To induce gene
expression, 1 mg/mL tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to
the T–REx–293 cell lines for 24 hours.
Culture and treatment of human synovial sarcoma cells
and MTT cell proliferation assays
Cell lines were grown in monolayer cultures and maintained
at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere as described (20).
Because of their low proliferative rate, HS-SY-II synovial sarcoma cells were not suitable for further functional assays. For
proliferation assays, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 2% FBS in 96-well dishes at least in triplicate. Cell
density was 5  103 per well. Cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of dasatinib (0.01–10 mmol/L; Santa Cruz Biotech), and appropriate controls were included. For combination treatments with chemotherapeutic drugs, cell lines were
incubated with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin, vincristine, and actinomycin D (0.1–100 ng/mL), alone or in
combination with dasatinib in a concentration resulting in
growth inhibition of 20% to 30%. Synergy was evaluated by
the fractional product method (29). A difference of more than
10% between the observed and the predicted effect was considered to signify synergistic activity between dasatinib and
the chemotherapeutic drug, a difference of less than 10% was
deﬁned as additive. All assays were conducted for 72 hours.
MTT proliferation assays (Roche) were conducted according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The formazan dye was quantiﬁed using a scanning multiwell spectrometer (BGM Labtech).

Knockdown of SRC and IGF-IR by RNA interference
1273/99 and CME-1 cells were cultured in 25-cm2 ﬂasks in
medium supplemented with 10% FBS as described above. At a
cell density of 50%, cells were transfected with 60 pmol Stealth
RNAi (SRC: HSS186080, HSS186081, HSS186082; IGF-IR:
HSS105253, HSS105254, HSS179797; Invitrogen) or nontargeting control siRNA (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After 24 hours, cells were trypsinized, reseeded, and MTT
assays were conducted as described above (2% FBS). To
document SRC knockdown, 5  104 siRNA-transfected cells
were plated in 12-well dishes in medium supplemented with
2% FBS and cultured for 72 hours.
Western blot analysis
A total of 2  105 to 4  105 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes
(Greiner) in medium supplemented with 2% FBS for 48 hours
before treatment with increasing doses of dasatinib for 60
minutes. To document SRC activation via the IGF-IR pathway,
1273/99, FUJI, and CME-1 cells were starved for 4 hours and
treated with 200 ng/mL recombinant IGF-II (R&D Systems).
Cell lysis and Western blots were conducted as described
before (20). Following primary antibodies were used according
to the manufacturer's instructions: b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich),
c-SRC (Santa Cruz Biotech), p-(Tyr416)-SRC, p-(Tyr527)-SRC,
STAT3, p-(Tyr705)-STAT3, FAK, p-(Tyr576/577)-FAK, p44/42
MAPK, p-(Thr202/Tyr204)-p44/42 MAPK, AKT, p-(Ser473)AKT, IGF-IR, p-(Tyr1131/Tyr1146)-IGF-IR (all Cell Signaling
Technologies), CSK, and PTP1B (Abcam). Secondary antibody
labeling as well as ﬁlter development were conducted using the
ECL kit (Amersham) as described before (26).
Flow cytometry
About 8  105 cells were grown in 75-cm2 cell culture
ﬂasks in medium supplemented with 2% FBS. After a preincubation of 18 hours, they were treated with 0.1 or 0.6
mmol/L dasatinib for 48 hours. For ﬂow cytometric immunophenotyping, 1  106 cells were ﬁxed on ice in ice-cold 2%
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. They were then washed in
PBS, collected by centrifugation, resuspended and incubated
in ice-cold PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes on ice.
After another washing step, cells were resuspended in 100 mL
PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing an Alexa
Fluor 647–labeled phospho-(Ser10)-histone H3 antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology; 1:20) and a phycoerythrinlabeled cleaved PARP (Asp214) antibody (BD Biosciences;
1:5) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.
After an additional washing step, 500 mL PBS containing 10
mg/mL 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to stain DNA, and cells were incubated for an
additional 30 minutes at room temperature. Analysis was
conducted using a three-laser LSRII analytical ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Each experiment was carried out
at least in duplicate. At least 30,000 events were recorded per
experiment. Only single cells were included in the analysis.
Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star) analysis software. To document SRC speciﬁcity of the effects of dasatinib,
the experiment was additionally carried out in CME-1 cells

48 hours after SRC siRNA transfection, which was done as
described above.
Analysis of apoptosis by DAPI staining
Cells were cultured as described above and treated with
0.03 or 0.3 mmol/L dasatinib. They were harvested and
washed in PBS, ﬁxed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes at room temperature, and washed again. After
incubation with 1 mg/mL DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes and 2 further washing steps, cells were mounted on
appropriate slides using Fluoromount-G medium (Southern
Biotechnologies Associates). Nuclei were visualized and
photographed using a Leica DMLB ﬂuorescence microscope.
Apoptotic cells were morphologically deﬁned by chromatin
condensation and fragmentation. For each assay, at least 300
cells were analyzed in triplicate.
Wound scratch, migration, and invasion assays
Cellular motility, migration, and invasion were analyzed by
wound scratch, Boyden chamber, and invasion chamber
assays. To exclude inﬂuences of growth effects on the results
of migration and invasion assays, dasatinib was used in concentrations of 1 or 3 nmol/L, that is concentrations, which were
shown to exert no signiﬁcant effects on cell viability in MTT
assays. CME-1 and SYO-1 cells were grown to conﬂuence in 6well dishes under serum-reduced conditions as described
above. Cell monolayers were wounded by scratching with a
sterile 100-mL pipette tip, medium was exchanged and the cells
were treated with dasatinib or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as
control. Photographs were taken at time points 0, 12, and 24
hours, using an AxioCam digital camera and the AxioVision
software (Zeiss). Boyden chamber motility assays were conducted with CME-1, SYO-1, and 1273/99 cells. A total of 2  104
to 7  104 tumor cells in 150 mL medium containing 2% FBS
were added into the upper Transwell chambers (6.5-mm
diameter, 8.0-mm pore size, Corning Costar Corporation) and
treated with dasatinib or DMSO as control for 24 hours. FBS
concentration in the lower chamber (500 mL) was 10%. Invasion chambers with Matrigel coating (6.4-mm diameter, pore
size 8 mm; BD) were used to assess the effect of dasatinib on
invasion in CME-1 and SYO-1 cells. Essentially, cells were
seeded and treated as for migration assays. Dishes were
incubated in a 37 C incubator (5% CO2) for 24 hours. After
removal of the nonmigrating cells from the upper chamber
with a cotton swab, the membranes were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, stained with Harris hematoxylin for 15 to 20 minutes, washed, removed from the plastic
holders, and mounted on glass slides with Aquatex (Merck).
Migrated cells were counted in ﬁve 10 ﬁelds (100 magniﬁcation). All assays were conducted at least in triplicate. To
document SRC speciﬁcity of the effects of dasatinib, Boyden
chamber and invasion chamber assays were additionally conducted in CME-1 cells 48 hours after SRC siRNA transfection,
which was done as described above.
RhoA and Rac activation assay
CME-1 and SYO-1 cells were cultured as described above
to yield a density of 30% to 60% after 72 hours. Cells were

then treated with 0.1 mmol/L of dasatinib for 20 minutes.
DMSO was used as control. Lysates were prepared and
immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein lysates
with equalized concentrations were analyzed. The assay
was conducted in duplicate according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Cytoskeleton).
In vivo experiments in SYO-1 xenografts
All mouse procedures were conducted in accordance with
the National and European Union guidelines and permission
was obtained from the local authorities. A total of 5  106 SYO1 synovial sarcoma cells were injected subcutaneously into the
right ﬂank of 5-week-old BALB/c nude mice (Charles River
Laboratories). Tumor growth was assessed daily by measuring
the tumor volume calculated as length  width  height  p/6.
Treatment was started when the tumor volume reached 100
mm3. Dasatinib was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a daily
dosage of 10 mg/kg (days 1–7). As no side effects were observed
during the ﬁrst week of treatment, the dosage was escalated to
20 mg/kg (days 8–14). After 15 days of treatment, animals were
sacriﬁced, tumors were explanted, and the tumor tissue was
formalin-ﬁxed and embedded in parafﬁn.

Results
Phosphokinase arrays
Phosphokinase array analysis of 1273/99 and HS-SY-II
synovial sarcoma cells detected phospho-(Tyr416)-SRC as
the most strongly phosphorylated protein kinase of 46
represented targets. Independent Western blotting conﬁrmed this ﬁnding and detected p-(Tyr416)-SRC levels of
different intensity in CME-1, SYO-1, FUJI, 1273/99, and HSSY-II synovial sarcoma cells (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table
S1). Because of their low proliferative rate, HS-SY-II synovial
sarcoma cells were not suitable for further functional
assays.
Synovial sarcomas display elevated levels of Tyr416phosphorylated SRC
In a set of 30 synovial sarcomas, immunohistochemical
stainings revealed strong expression levels of Tyr416-phosphorylated SRC in 13% of the samples, 60% showed moderate,
and 27% weak expression levels. In contrast, strong Tyr527phosphorylated SRC was detectable in only 7% of the samples,
whereas moderate or weak expression was found in 10% and
30% of the tumors, respectively; in 53% of the samples, no

expression of Tyr527-phosphorylated SRC was detectable.
Expression levels for CSK were strong in 30%, moderate in
17%, and weak in 50% of the samples, no CSK expression was
found in one synovial sarcoma. Expression levels for PTP1B
were strong in 13%, moderate in 37%, and weak in 40% of the
samples, no expression of PTP1B was found in 10% of the
samples. No signiﬁcant correlation between SRC phosphorylation status and CSK or PTP1B protein expression levels was
detected. Tyr416-phosphorylated SRC expression in the tumor
samples did not correlate with the patients' age, sex, tumor
location, and tumor size or tumor grade. As in the immunohistochemical analysis, no correlation between SRC activity
and PTP1B or CSK levels was observed in the cell lines analyzed
in Western blots (Fig. 1 and data not shown).
SRC activation in synovial sarcoma is induced by SS18/
SSX translocation
To functionally understand the mechanism of SRC activation in synovial sarcoma, T-REx-293 cells were stably
transfected with vectors containing SS18/SSX1, SS18/SSX2,
SSX1, SSX2, or SS18 cDNA to obtain an inducible cell culture
model of the synovial sarcoma–speciﬁc chimeric translocation proteins. Western blot analysis showed elevated levels
of activated p-(Tyr416)-SRC in T-REx-293 cells transfected
with SS18/SSX1 and SS18/SSX2 (Fig. 2A); expression levels of
PTP1B and CSK were not affected (data not shown). As it has
been shown previously that receptor tyrosine kinase pathways including IGF-IR signaling are of particular importance
in synovial sarcomas, we analyzed promoter-speciﬁc expression levels of IGF2 showing upregulation of promoter P2and P4-dependent IGF2 transcripts in SS18/SSX1 and SS18/
SSX2-expressing T-REx-293 cells (Fig. 2B). Stimulation of
1273/99, FUJI and CME-1 synovial sarcoma cells with recombinant human IGF-II protein was associated with an
increase of phosphorylation of IGF-IR at Tyr1131, AKT at
Ser473, and SRC at Tyr416, which revealed IGF-IR signaling
as a functionally relevant mechanism leading to SRC activation (Fig. 2C). A minor induction of phosphorylation of
SRC at Tyr416 was observed upon SS18 overexpression alone
as well; however, this activation was not associated with
IGF2 transcriptional induction. Inversely, siRNA knockdown
of the IGF-IR in CME-1 cells was associated with a significant decrease of p-(Tyr416)-SRC levels (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
SRC inhibition by dasatinib or RNA interference impairs
growth of synovial sarcoma cells
siRNA-mediated knockdown of SRC resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease of growth of CME-1 and 1273/99 cells in MTT assays
(t test: P < 0.001; Fig. 3A and data not shown). All analyzed
synovial sarcoma cell lines displayed dose-dependent growth
inhibition upon treatment with the SRC inhibitor dasatinib
(Fig. 3B). This effect was particularly distinct in nanomolar
concentrations of the inhibitor. Among the 4 synovial sarcoma
cell lines investigated CME-1 (GI50 ¼ 0.008 mmol/L), FUJI (GI50
¼ 0.01 mmol/L), and SYO-1 (GI50 ¼ 0.013 mmol/L) were found to
be slightly more sensitive to dasatinib than 1273/99 cells (GI50
¼ 0.077 mmol/L).

Inhibition of SRC affects phosphorylation of its
interaction partners
To assess the effect of SRC inhibition on its interaction
partners in synovial sarcomas, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of dasatinib (0.01–3 mmol/L) for 60 minutes
(Fig. 3C). Dose-dependent dephosphorylation of p-(Tyr416)SRC, p-(Ser473)-AKT, p-(Tyr576/577)-FAK, p-(Tyr705)-STAT3,
and p-(Tyr1131)-IGF-IR was observed in all synovial sarcoma
cell lines with nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib. Similarly, siRNA knockdown of SRC led to the dephosphorylation of

Dasatinib treatment increases apoptosis and decreases
mitotic rate in synovial sarcoma cells
To determine the effect of dasatinib on the apoptotic and
mitotic rate of synovial sarcoma cells, ﬂow cytometric
analyses were conducted. Cleaved PARP (Asp214) was used
as a marker of apoptosis, and phospho-(Ser10)-histone H3
was used as a marker of mitosis. CME-1, 1273/99, and SYO-1
cell lines showed signiﬁcantly increased rates of apoptosis
and decreased mitotic fractions after treatment with dasatinib in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.6 mmol/L (Fig. 4A,
Supplementary Table S2). These results were conﬁrmed by

Combination of SRC inhibition and conventional
chemotherapy results in additive effects on cell growth
To determine the effects of combinations of conventional
chemotherapy (vincristine, doxorubicin, actinomycin D) and
dasatinib on the growth of synovial sarcoma cells, we investigated 1273/99 cells, which were the least responsive to
monotreatments with dasatinib. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of conventional cytotoxic drugs and to a
concentration of dasatinib that led to 20% to 30% growth
inhibition after 72 hours. The combinations did not fulﬁll the

resulted from an additive, obviously independent action of
the SRC inhibitor and conventional chemotherapeutic agents
(Fig. 4C).
Dasatinib inhibits motility and invasive potential of
synovial sarcoma cells associated with an increased
activity of RhoA and diminished Rac activity
As SRC has been shown to modulate motility and invasiveness of tumor cells, we investigated the effect of SRC
inhibition by dasatinib on cell migration and invasion. CME1, SYO-1, and 1273/99 synovial sarcoma cells (treated with
dasatinib in doses not affecting cell viability) showed a dosedependent decrease of migratory and invasive potential in
Boyden chamber and invasion chamber assays. Accordingly,
wound healing was impaired in scratch assays in CME-1 and
SYO-1 treated with dasatinib. In ELISA-based RhoA and Rac
activation assays, treatment with dasatinib resulted in sig-

Discussion
Considerable progress has been made in the understanding
of soft-tissue tumors in the recent years. However, apart from
few examples such as c-KIT or platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) receptor inhibition in GIST and dermatoﬁbrosarcoma
protuberans (5, 6), the translation of molecular results into
clinical care in terms of molecularly based therapies is still rare
in this group of neoplasias. Despite elaborate treatment pro-

tocols involving radical surgery and standardized chemo- and
radiotherapy, prognosis is poor in advanced cases of synovial
sarcoma. Therefore, the identiﬁcation of molecular targets,
which are at the same time biologically essential and accessible
to speciﬁc therapeutic drugs, represents an important issue for
the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.
On the basis of a phosphokinase screen, we identiﬁed the
SRC tyrosine kinase as one of the most strongly phosphorylated
kinases in synovial sarcoma cells. Its particular relevance was
conﬁrmed immunohistochemically in biopsies of 30 synovial
sarcomas, in which Tyr416-phosphorylated, that is activated,

SRC was found to be expressed in the majority of the cases. A
consistent pattern of dysregulation of the SRC-regulating
proteins CSK and PTP1B, analogous to what has been shown
in some epithelial tumors could be excluded in synovial
sarcomas (15–17, 30). Interestingly, SRC was found to be
activated through the SS18/SSX translocation proteins. This
activation was associated with an IGF-IR–dependent mechanism based on transcriptional induction of IGF2, which links
SRC activation to the characteristic molecular aberration of
synovial sarcomas. As shown, expression of the transcriptional
cofactor SS18 alone is capable to (indirectly) induce SRC
phosphorylation at lower levels as well; however, this appears
to be independent from IGF2 induction. This ﬁnding underlines the oncogenic character of the SS18/SSX fusion proteins
and distinguishes components of the IGF/SRC context from
other therapeutic targets as molecularly based and tumorspeciﬁc. However, the ﬁnding of consistent expression of
further growth factor receptors, such as PDGFR and EGFR,
in synovial sarcomas makes it probable that other than IGFIR–dependent pathways may mediate SRC activation in synovial sarcomas as well (31). Considering the IGF-IR and the SRC
kinases as potential therapeutic targets, its central position
within different oncogenic signaling pathways makes SRC an

2526

attractive candidate for speciﬁcally directed approaches. As
shown here, synovial sarcomas display a fundamental dependence on SRC signals with regard to cellular proliferation and
survival. This was observed in vitro in siRNA-mediated
approaches and after pharmacologic intervention with the
SRC inhibitor dasatinib as well as in vivo in murine synovial
sarcoma xenografts. A role for dasatinib is clinically wellestablished in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia
and Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), in which the substance inhibits Abl kinases
(32, 33). Effectivity of dasatinib has previously been shown for
cells derived from solid tumors as well, including mesenchymal
neoplasias, such as GIST and chondrosarcoma (34, 35). In
chondrosarcoma, growth effects observed upon treatment
with dasatinib were not consistently associated with diminished p-(Tyr416)-SRC levels, which makes SRC-independent
modes of action probable (35). In contrast, in synovial sarcomas, dephosphorylation of SRC and its targets was a consistent
feature detectable upon treatment with dasatinib. The low
drug dosages resulting in dephosphorylation of the SRC targets
argue in favor of SRC-dependent effects and against effects
exerted through direct interaction of dasatinib with IGF-IR,
FAK, and AKT (36). As an indirect proof of speciﬁc SRC-related

action of dasatinib in synovial sarcoma cells, CME-1 did not
display any signiﬁcant effects upon dasatinib treatment after
siRNA-mediated SRC knockdown. Interestingly, SRC inhibition
was associated with a loss of phosphorylation of the IGF-IR at
Tyr1131, which indicates activation of IGF-IR tyrosine kinase
activity usually detectable upon ligand binding. This ﬁnding is
particularly relevant for the option of IGF-IR directed therapeutic approaches, which have been proposed for synovial
sarcomas recently (20, 37). Beyond that, because of the central
position of SRC within intracellular signaling networks and its
obvious capacity of cross-activating pathways as documented
here, it is conceivable that targeting SRC as a central component
integrating different signaling activities might be advantageous
compared with individual receptor-directed approaches. As
shown here, combined treatment of synovial sarcoma cells with
chemotherapeutic drugs and dasatinib results in additive but
not in synergistic effects. Therefore, SRC inhibitors might be
useful in innovative therapeutic approaches, in which targeting
of an activated pathway with speciﬁc inhibitory substances
allows the reduction of the individual compounds' dosages,
thereby minimizing toxicity. In our in vivo experiments, dasatinib was found to be highly effective with regard to tumor
growth and was well tolerated by the animals.
As known for a variety of epithelial tumors (36, 38), on the
basis of our data, the SRC signaling network appears to be of
crucial relevance for cellular migration and invasion in synovial
sarcomas. In all assays applied here, doses of dasatinib, which
did not affect cellular proliferation, resulted in signiﬁcantly
impaired migratory and invasive capacities. These effects were
associated with an SRC-dependent shift in activation levels of
Rac and RhoA, small GTPases essentially involved in the
regulation of cell mobility processes. This ﬁnding provides a
functional background of the effects observed here and substantiates speciﬁcity, as increased levels of activated RhoA are
associated with stress ﬁber formation, whereas diminished
levels of activated Rac go along with the impairment of a
"motile" phenotype (18). This ﬁnding is of particular importance with regard to therapeutic concepts, as prognostically
unfavorable cases of synovial sarcomas frequently develop
metastases. Using a dual-inhibition approach of SRC and
Aurora kinases by SU6656, Arai and colleagues recently
observed high antitumor effectiveness in synovial sarcoma
xenografts involving antiangiogenic mechanisms. This ﬁnding

provides further evidence of the crucial role of SRC with regard
to complex aspects of tumor biology and underlines its role in a
oncogenic signaling network (39).
In summary, our data in detail substantiate previous ﬁndings on the relevance of SRC in synovial sarcomas (40). For the
ﬁrst time, it is systematically shown that the SRC signaling
network is commonly activated in synovial sarcomas and that
targeting SRC results in substantial effects on tumor cell
growth and motility. These ﬁndings argue in favor of SRC as
a potential therapeutic target in synovial sarcomas.
