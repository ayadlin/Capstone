Abstract
The synthetic triterpenoid methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean1,9-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me) is in phase I clinical trials as
a novel cancer therapeutic agent. We previously showed
that CDDO-Me induces c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)–
dependent death receptor 5 (DR5) expression and augments
death receptor–induced apoptosis. The current study focused
on addressing how CDDO-Me induces JNK-dependent DR5
expression. Analysis of DR5 promoter regions defines that the
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein
(CHOP) binding site is responsible for CDDO-Me–induced
transactivation of the DR5 gene. Consistently, CDDO-Me
induced DR5 expression and parallel CHOP up-regulation.
Blockade of CHOP up-regulation also abrogated CDDO-Me–
induced DR5 expression. These results indicate that CDDO-Me
induces CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation. Moreover, the
JNK inhibitor SP600125 abrogated CHOP induction by
CDDO-Me, suggesting a JNK-dependent CHOP up-regulation
by CDDO-Me as well. Importantly, knockdown of CHOP
attenuated CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis, showing that
CHOP induction is involved in CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis.
Additionally, CDDO-Me increased the levels of Bip, phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A, inositol
requiring kinase 1A, and activating transcription factor 4,
all of which are featured changes during endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, salubrinal, an inhibitor
of ER stress–induced apoptosis, inhibited JNK activation and
up-regulation of CHOP and DR5 by CDDO-Me and protected
cells from CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis. Thus, ER stress
seems to be important for CDDO-Me–induced JNK activation,
CHOP and DR5 up-regulation, and apoptosis. Collectively,
we conclude that CDDO-Me triggers ER stress, leading to
JNK-dependent, CHOP-mediated DR5 up-regulation and
apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7484–92]

Introduction
The novel synthetic triterpenoid methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me) potently induces apoptosis of
cancer cells and exhibits antitumor activity in animal models (1–6).
Thus, CDDO-Me holds promise as a cancer therapeutic agent and
is currently being tested in phase I clinical trials. It is well known

that apoptosis can occur through two major apoptotic pathways:
the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway and the extrinsic
death receptor–induced pathway. These two pathways are linked
by the truncated proapoptotic protein Bid (7). Our previous studies
have shown that CDDO-Me depletes intracellular glutathione
(GSH), activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and finally leads
to up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5), which contributes to
CDDO-Me–mediated activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
and augmentation of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis (8, 9). However, the
detailed molecular mechanism by which CDDO-Me induces DR5
expression is unknown.
It is known that DR5 expression can be regulated at the
transcriptional level through both p53-dependent (10, 11) and
p53-independent mechanisms (12–15). Our previous study suggested that CDDO-Me induces DR5 expression independent
of p53 status (8). Thus, we are particularly interested in p53independent mechanisms. It has been documented that the
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP),
also known as growth arrest and DNA damage gene 153
(GADD153), directly regulates DR5 expression through a CHOP
binding site in the 5-flanking region of the DR5 gene (16, 17). Thus,
certain drugs induce DR5 expression through CHOP-dependent
transactivation of the DR5 gene (16–20).
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary organelle for
proper protein folding and assembling as well as calcium storage.
The accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER lumen leads to the
ER stress response known as unfold protein response. This
response ensures coordinate regulation of gene expression at
various levels including transcription, translation, and protein
degradation to shut down general protein synthesis and to induce
the expression of genes including those encoding resident ER
proteins with chaperone and folding functions for restoring proper
protein folding and ER homeostasis. In addition, this response also
activates specific apoptotic pathways to eliminate severely
damaged cells, in which the protein folding defects cannot be
resolved (21–23).
Inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), double-stranded RNAactivated protein kinase–like ER kinase (PERK), and activating
transcription factor (ATF)-6 are three critical transmembrane
ER signaling proteins that regulate the unfold protein response
through their respective signaling cascades. Under resting condition, the chaperone protein Bip binds to the luminal domains
of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, preventing their activation. However,
accumulation of unfolded proteins will release Bip, allowing
aggregation of these transmembrane signaling proteins and
launching the unfold protein response (21, 23). Although ER
stress–induced apoptotic signaling pathways have not been fully

uncovered, several mechanisms have been suggested. These
include transcriptional induction of CHOP through multiple
signaling pathways including PERK/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a)–dependent mechanisms, IRE1-mediated
JNK activation, and cleavage and activation of ER-specific caspase12 (22–24).
Given that CDDO-Me induces JNK-dependent DR5 up-regulation
(8, 9), the current study focused on addressing whether CHOP
is involved in JNK-dependent DR5 induction by CDDO-Me and,
if it does, whether CDDO-Me also induces ER stress. Using
human non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as a model
system, we have, for the first time, showed that CDDO-Me indeed
induces ER stress and CHOP expression, which participate in
JNK-dependent DR5 expression by CDDO-Me.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. CDDO-Me, which was previously described (25) and provided
by Dr. M.B. Sporn (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), was dissolved

Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti–h-actin antibody and N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
Cell lines and cell culture. The human NSCLC cell lines used in this
study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. These
cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell protein lysates were prepared and
analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (26, 27).

using the Annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) apoptosis detection kit purchased
from BD Biosciences following the manufacturer’s instructions or by
measuring sub-G1 populations using flow cytometry as described previously
(29). We also detected caspase activation by Western blotting (as described
above) as an additional indicator of apoptosis.
Detection of cell surface DR5. The procedure for direct antibody
staining and subsequent flow cytometric analysis of cell surface proteins
was described previously (19). The mean fluorescent intensity, which
represents antigenic density on a per cell basis, was used to represent
TRAIL receptor expression level. PE-conjugated mouse anti-human DR5

instructions. Control (i.e., nonsilencing) and CHOP siRNAs were described
previously (19). Gene silencing effect was evaluated by Western blot analysis
as described above after the indicated time of treatment.
Construction of DR5 reporter plasmids, transient transfection, and
luciferase activity assay. The reporter constructs containing a 552-bp
5¶-flanking region of the DR5 gene with wild-type, mutated CHOP binding
site, nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) binding site, or Elk binding sites were
generously provided by Dr. H-G. Wang (University of South Florida College
of Medicine, Tampa, FL; ref. 16). The pGL3-DR5( 1400), pGL3-DR5( 810),
pGL3-DR5( 420), pGL3-DR5( 373), pGL3-DR5( 240), and pGL3DR5( 120) reporter constructs were described previously (19, 30). The
plasmid transfection and luciferase assay were the same as described
previously (19).

Results
CDDO-Me activates DR5 transcription in a CHOP-dependent
manner. We previously reported that CDDO-Me increases DR5

transcription (8). To determine how CDDO-Me increases DR5
transcription, we began our study by examining the effects of
CDDO-Me on the transactivation of reporter constructs with
different lengths of DR5 5¶-flanking regions (Fig. 1A) to identify the
region responsible for CDDO-Me–mediated DR5 transactivation. In
this transient transfection and luciferase assay, CDDO-Me did not
increase the luciferase activity of pGL3-DR5( 240) and pGL3DR5( 120) while significantly increasing the luciferase activity
of pGL3-DR5( 373), pGL3-DR5( 420), and pGL3-DR5( 1040;
Fig. 1A), indicating that the region between 240 and 373 has
essential element(s) responsible for CDDO-Me–induced DR5
transactivation. Because a CHOP binding site is located in this
region, we further compared the effects of CDDO-Me on the
transactivation of reporter constructs carrying wild-type and
mutated CHOP binding sites, respectively. As controls, we also
included constructs carrying mutated NF-nB and Elk binding sites,
respectively (Fig. 1B). As presented in Fig. 1C, CDDO-Me increased

with the indicated concentrations of CDDO-Me for 12 h. B, CDDO-Me induces time-dependent DR5 expression. H460 and H1792 cells were treated with 1 Amol/L
CDDO-Me for the times indicated. C, blockade of CHOP induction abrogates CDDO-Me–induced DR5 up-regulation. Both H1792 and H460 cell lines were transfected

After the aforementioned treatments (A–C ), the cells were subjected to preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis. D, blockade of
CHOP induction inhibits CDDO-Me–induced increase in cell surface DR5. H1792 cells were transfected with control or CHOP siRNA. After 48 h, the cells were
treated with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me for 12 h and then subjected to staining of cell surface DR5 and subsequent flow cytometry. Ab, antibody.

CHOP-Dependent DR5 Up-regulation by CDDO-Me

Figure 3. Blockade of JNK activation prevents CDDO-Me–induced
up-regulation of CHOP and DR5 but not increases in ER stress marker proteins.
The indicated cell lines were pretreated with 10 or 20 Amol/L SP600125 for
30 min and then cotreated with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me for an additional 6 h. The
cells were then harvested and subjected to preparation of whole-cell protein
lysates for detection of the indicated proteins by Western blot analysis.
SP600125 alone at the tested concentrations did not modulate the levels of
CHOP, DR5, ATF4, and p-eIF2a.

the lucifease activity of the constructs carrying the wild-type DR5
promoter region or the DR5 promoter region with mutated NF-nB
or Elk binding sites. However, CDDO-Me failed to increase the
luciferase activity of the construct carrying the DR5 promoter
region with a mutated CHOP binding site. These results clearly
indicate that the CHOP binding site in the DR5 promoter region is
responsible for CDDO-Me–induced DR5 transactivation.
CDDO-Me increases CHOP expression leading to DR5
up-regulation. We next determined whether CDDO-Me actually
induces CHOP expression. By Western blot analysis, we detected a
concentration- and time-dependent CHOP induction accompanied
by DR5 up-regulation in cells exposed to CDDO-Me (Fig. 2A and B).
To test whether CHOP induction is involved in mediating CDDOMe–induced DR5 up-regulation, we silenced CHOP expression via
siRNA transfection to block CDDO-Me–induced CHOP expression.
As presented in Fig. 2C, we detected CHOP induction in cells
transfected with control siRNA, but not or only minimally in CHOP
siRNA–transfected cells after exposing to CDDO-Me, indicating a
successful silencing of CHOP expression. Accordingly, we detected
DR5 up-regulation only in control siRNA–transfected cells when
treated with CDDO-Me. In agreement, CDDO-Me increased cell
surface DR5 levels in control siRNA–transfected cells, but only
minimally in CHOP siRNA–transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, these
data clearly indicate that CDDO-Me–induced DR5 up-regulation is
secondary to CHOP induction.
We detected two bands for DR5 protein in the blots (Fig. 2). It is
noteworthy that the two-band pattern of DR5 protein is consistent
with the previously published results on DR5 protein (8, 27, 30–32).

www.aacrjournals.org

Their specificities were also confirmed by using DR5 siRNA (8, 19,
27) previously and in the current study (Fig. 2). The two bands of
DR5 protein may correspond to the products of two isoforms of
DR5 gene as described previously (33).
CDDO-Me–induced CHOP expression is JNK dependent. We
previously showed that CDDO-Me induces JNK-dependent DR5
up-regulation (8). Given that CHOP is also regulated by JNK
activation (34), we then examined whether CHOP induction by
CDDO-Me involves JNK activation. To this end, we treated cells
with CDDO-Me in the absence and presence of the JNK inhibitor
SP600125 and then analyzed CHOP and DR5 expression. In
agreement with our previous finding (8), the presence of
SP600125 abrogated the ability of CDDO-Me to increase p-c-Jun
levels and DR5 expression. Concurrently, CDDO-Me–induced
CHOP expression was also inhibited by SP600125 (Fig. 3). Thus,
these results suggest that CDDO-Me induces CHOP-dependent DR5
up-regulation involving JNK activation.
CHOP induction contributes to CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis.
We previously showed that DR5 up-regulation contributes to
CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis (8). Given that CDDO-Me induces
CHOP-dependent DR5 expression, it is plausible to speculate that
CHOP induction should also contribute to CDDO-Me–induced
apoptosis. Indeed, we found that CDDO-Me induced f35%
apoptotic cells in control siRNA–transfected H1792 cells, but only
f20% apoptotic cells in CHOP siRNA–transfected H1792 cells
(Fig. 4A). In agreement, we detected a striking activation of caspase8 and caspase-3 in CDDO-Me–treated H460 cells transfected
with control siRNA evidenced by decreased levels of proforms of
caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP, accompanied by the appearance of
the strong cleaved bands of these proteins. However, we detected only
minimal reduction of the proforms of these proteins with weaker
bands of their cleaved forms in CDDO-Me–treated H460 cells
transfected with CHOP siRNA (Fig. 4B). By directly evaluating
apoptosis using the Annexin V staining, we detected f25% and
34% apoptosis, respectively, in control siRNA–transfected H460 cells
but only 11% and 17% apoptosis, respectively, in CHOP siRNA–
transfected cells when exposed to 0.5 and 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me
(Fig. 4C). These results collectively indicate that blockade of
CHOP induction attenuates CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis. Thus,
we conclude that CHOP induction contributes to CDDO-Me–induced
apoptosis.
CDDO-Me induces ER stress. Given that CHOP is known to be
a featured ER stress marker protein involved in ER stress–mediated
apoptosis, we further determined whether CDDO-Me induces
ER stress. To this end, we detected the levels of several typical
ER stress marker proteins, which are usually increased (e.g., Bip,
IRE1a, p-eIF2a, and ATF4) during ER stress, in cells exposed to
CDDO-Me. As presented in Fig. 5A, CDDO-Me increased the levels
of Bip in three NSCLC cell lines (left). Moreover, CDDO-Me also
elevated the levels of IRE1a, p-eIF2a, and ATF4 (right). The
increase in Bip, IRE1a, p-eIF2a, and ATF4 occurred quickly, as early
as 1 or 2 hours after CDDO-Me treatment. Together, these results
suggest that CDDO-Me induces ER stress.
CDDO-Me–induced ER stress is associated with induction
of apoptosis. To determine the effect of ER stress on CDDOMe–induced apoptosis, we compared the effects of CDDO-Me on
induction of apoptosis in the absence and presence of salubrinal,
an inhibitor of ER stress–induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5B,
the presence of salubrinal (particularly at 50 and 75 Amol/L)
significantly protected lung cancer cells from CDDO-Me–induced
cell death. In agreement, CDDO-Me–induced cleavage of caspase-8,

Cancer Research

caspase-9, and PARP and an increase in Annexin V–positive
(i.e., apoptotic) populations were also substantially inhibited by
salubrinal (Fig. 5C and D). Thus, it seems that ER stress is involved
in CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis.
CDDO-Me–induced JNK activation and up-regulation of
CHOP and DR5 are secondary to ER stress. To decipher the
relationship between ER stress, JNK activation, and CHOPdependent DR5 induction, we compared the effects of CDDO-Me
on the levels of p-c-Jun, CHOP, and DR5 in the absence and
presence of salubrinal. As presented in Fig. 6A, CDDO-Me increased
the levels of p-c-Jun, CHOP, and DR5 in the absence of salubrinal,
but these effects were substantially inhibited in the presence of
salubrinal, suggesting that CDDO-Me–initiated increases in the
levels of these proteins are all associated with ER stress.
Consistently, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 had minimal inhibition
on CDDO-Me–induced increase in ATF4 and p-eIF2a while
preventing CHOP and DR5 up-regulation (Fig. 3), further supporting the notion that the activation of JNK and up-regulation of
CHOP and DR5 are consequences of ER stress.
We noted that salubrinal alone strongly increased the levels
of p-eIF2a and ATF4, but weakly elevated CHOP levels. When
combined with CDDO-Me, salubrinal minimally inhibited the
CDDO-Me–induced ATF4 increase while substantially abrogating

CDDO-Me–induced CHOP up-regulation in both H460 and H1792
cell lines. Similarly, salubrinal did not affect (e.g., H1792) or weakly
inhibited (e.g., H460) CDDO-Me–induced elevation of p-eIF2a levels
(Fig. 6A).
CDDO-Me triggers ER stress through depletion of intracellular GSH. We and others previously showed that GSH depletion
plays a critical role in mediating induction of apoptosis including
JNK activation and DR5 up-regulation by CDDO-Me or its
analogues (1, 9, 35, 36). Thus, we further examined the protective
effects of NAC, which prevents GSH reduction with an antioxidative property, on CDDO-Me–induced ER stress, JNK activation,
and up-regulation of CHOP and DR5 expression. In agreement
with our previous findings (9), NAC attenuated the ability of
CDDO-Me to increase p-c-Jun levels and DR5 expression. Besides,
CDDO-Me–induced increases in CHOP and ATF4 and phosphorylation of elF2a were all substantially inhibited by NAC (Fig. 6B).
Collectively, these results indicate that CDDO-Me induces ER stress
through depletion of intracellular GSH.

Discussion
Our previous studies have shown that CDDO-Me induces
DR5 up-regulation, resulting in induction of apoptosis and

enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer
cells (8, 9). Moreover, we have shown that CDDO-Me increases DR5
expression at the transcription level (8) secondary to GSH
depletion–initiated JNK activation (8, 9). Here we further show
that CDDO-Me increases CHOP-dependent transcription of the
DR5 gene. It has been well documented that CHOP is an important
transcription factor that regulates DR5 expression (16, 17, 19, 20).
Through the deletion and mutation analysis of the DR5 5¶-flanking
region, we revealed that the regions containing the CHOP binding
site are essential for CDDO-Me–mediated DR5 transactivation
(Fig. 1). Consistently, CDDO-Me induced a time- and dosedependent CHOP expression, which was accompanied by DR5
up-regulation. Moreover, blockage of CDDO-Me–mediated CHOP
induction by CHOP siRNA accordingly abrogated the ability of
CDDO-Me to up-regulate DR5 expression (Fig. 2). Collectively, we
conclude that CDDO-Me induces DR5 expression through a CHOPdependent mechanism.

www.aacrjournals.org

We previously showed that DR5 induction is involved in CDDOMe–induced apoptosis (8). In this study, we found that blockade of
CDDO-Me–induced CHOP up-regulation through siRNA-mediated
gene silencing not only abrogated DR5 up-regulation by CDDO-Me
but also diminished the ability of CDDO-Me to induce apoptosis
(Fig. 4). Thus, we conclude that CHOP induction also participates
in CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis. Thus, these findings further
highlight the important role of DR5 up-regulation in CDDO-Me–
induced apoptosis. We noted that blockage of CHOP did not
abolish the ability of CDDO-Me to induce apoptosis despite
substantially inhibiting DR5 induction (Figs. 2 and 4). Thus, it is
possible that mechanisms other than CHOP/DR5 may also be
involved in mediating CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis. It has been
documented that NF-nB represses CHOP expression (37), whereas
CDDO-Me inhibits NF-nB (38, 39). Thus, future study may
investigate whether inhibition of NF-nB is involved in CDDOMe–induced CHOP/DR5 expression.

It is well known that CHOP is a typical ER stress–regulated
protein involved in ER stress–induced apoptosis (24). Thus, our
finding on CHOP induction by CDDO-Me suggests that CDDO-Me
may trigger ER stress. Indeed, CDDO-Me increased the levels of
Bip, IRE1a, p-eIF2a, and ATF4 (Fig. 5), all of which are additional
proteins accumulated or increased during ER stress (21, 22).
Therefore, it seems that CDDO-Me induces ER stress. Salubrinal is
a selective inhibitor of eIF2a dephosphorylation and ER stress–
induced apoptosis (40). The presence of salubrinal apparently
protected lung cancer cells from CDDO-Me–induced decrease in
cell survival, caspase activation, and apoptotic death (Fig. 5).
Thus, it seems that CDDO-Me induces apoptosis involving ER
stress. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
showing the involvement of ER stress in CDDO-Me–induced
apoptosis.
Both JNK and CHOP are implicated in mediating ER stress–
induced apoptosis (23). A recent study suggested that JNK
activation during ER stress contributes to CHOP expression (34).
We previously showed that CDDO-Me activates JNK leading to DR5
up-regulation and apoptosis (8, 9). In the present study, we
detected both JNK activation and CHOP induction in cells exposed
to CDDO-Me. Moreover, the presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125
attenuated CDDO-Me–induced CHOP expression in addition to
inhibition of DR5 expression, indicating that CDOO-Me-induced

CHOP expression is also JNK dependent. Collectively, we conclude
that JNK activation mediates CHOP-dependent DR5 induction.
We noted that SP600125 inhibited CDDO-Me–induced c-Jun
phosphorylation completely, but only partially prevented CHOP
and DR5 up-regulation by CDDO-Me in H460 cells (Fig. 3). Thus,
we cannot role out the possibility that other mechanisms
also participate in CDDO-Me–induced, CHOP-dependent DR5
up-regulation.
Although SP600125 inhibited CDDO-Me–induced CHOP and
DR5 up-regulation, it minimally prevented CDDO-Me–induced
increases in p-eIF2a and ATF4 (Fig. 3), suggesting that JNK
activation and subsequent up-regulation of CHOP and DR5
are secondary to ER stress. This notion was further supported by
our findings that salubrinal attenuated the ability of CDDO-Me
to increase c-Jun phosphorylation, CHOP induction, and DR5
up-regulation (Fig. 6A) while inhibiting CDDO-Me–induced
apoptosis (Fig. 4). Taken together, we conclude that CDDO-Me
induces ER stress, leading to JNK activation and subsequent
CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation (Fig. 6C).
It is generally thought that the eIF2a/ATF4 signaling pathway
is the primary mechanism for the induction of CHOP in ER stress
(22, 24). However, other pathways also can regulate CHOP
expression in ER stress (22, 24). It has been initially shown that
salubrinal protects cells from ER stress–induced apoptosis through

marker proteins, and a schematic model for CDDO-Me–induced DR5 expression (C ). A and B, both H460 and H1792 cells (A) or H1792 cells (B ) were pretreated with
75 Amol/L salubrinal (A) or the indicated concentrations of NAC (B) for 30 min and then cotreated with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me for an additional 6 h. The cells were
then subjected to preparation of whole-cell protein lysates for detection of the indicated proteins by Western blot analysis. Asterisk, nonspecific bands. C, schematic
model for CDDO-Me–induced DR5 expression. CDDO-Me induces ER stress via depletion of intracellular GSH, leading to JNK activation and subsequent
CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation.

CHOP-Dependent DR5 Up-regulation by CDDO-Me

increasing p-eIF2a levels by inhibiting eIF2a dephosphorylation.
Consequently, CHOP expression is also increased (40). However,
salubrinal can also potentiate ER stress and induce apoptosis
through such a mechanism involving up-regulation of ATF4 and
CHOP under certain conditions (41). In our study, salubrinal
apparently protects NSCLC cells from CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis as discussed above. Salubrinal itself strongly increased the levels
of p-eIF2a and ATF4 while weakly inducing CHOP expression in
human NSCLC cells. Interestingly, salubrinal minimally inhibits
CDDO-Me–induced elevation of p-eIF2a and ATF4 levels, whereas
it strongly abrogated the ability of CDDO-Me to increase p-c-Jun,
CHOP expression, and DR5 up-regulation (Fig. 6A). These results
imply that CDDO-Me is unlikely to induce CHOP expression
through the p-eIF2a/ATF4-mediated signaling pathway in ER
stress. Thus, the mechanism underlying CDDO-Me–induced,
JNK-dependent CHOP up-regulation in ER stress needs further
investigation.
It has been documented in several studies that depletion of
intracellular GSH plays a critical role in initiating apoptosis by
CDDO-Me or its analogues (1, 9, 35, 36). This is likely caused by the
reversible interaction between CDDO-Me and GSH (42). We
previously showed that CDDO-Me depletes intracellular GSH,
resulting in JNK-dependent DR5 up-regulation and apoptosis in
human NSCLC cells (9). In this study, we found that the presence

of NAC abrogated the effects of CDDO-Me not only on activating
JNK and inducing DR5 expression but also on increasing the levels
of CHOP, ATF4, and p-eIF2a, all of which are typical ER stress
marker proteins (Fig. 6B). Thus, it seems that CDDO-Me induces
ER stress through depletion of intracellular GSH.
In summary, the present study has shown that CDDO-Me
depletes intracellular GSH, resulting in ER stress. Subsequently, it
activates JNK, leading to CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation and
apoptosis (Fig. 6C).
