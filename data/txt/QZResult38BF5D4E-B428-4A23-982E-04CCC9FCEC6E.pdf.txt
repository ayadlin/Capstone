SUMMARY

During adaptive angiogenesis, a key process in the
etiology and treatment of cancer and obesity, the
vasculature changes to meet the metabolic needs
of its target tissues. Although the cues governing
vascular remodeling are not fully understood,
target-derived signals are generally believed to
underlie this process. Here, we identify an alternative mechanism by characterizing the previously
unrecognized nutrient-dependent plasticity of the
Drosophila tracheal system: a network of oxygendelivering tubules developmentally akin to mammalian blood vessels. We find that this plasticity, particularly prominent in the intestine, drives—rather than
responds to—metabolic change. Mechanistically, it
is regulated by distinct populations of nutrient- and
oxygen-responsive neurons that, through delivery
of both local and systemic insulin- and VIP-like neuropeptides, sculpt the growth of specific tracheal
subsets. Thus, we describe a novel mechanism by
which nutritional cues modulate neuronal activity to
give rise to organ-specific, long-lasting changes in
vascular architecture.
INTRODUCTION
Unlike the more stereotypical development of the body’s main
blood vessels, the formation of the capillary networks responsible for tissue perfusion is an adaptive process primarily governed by the metabolic needs of the target tissues (Fraisl et al.,
2009; Potente et al., 2011). The plastic nature of this adaptive
angiogenesis is further highlighted by the dramatic changes in
vascularization observed in tumors or in obese adipose tissue:

changes that contribute to the progression of pathologies such
as cancer and obesity and are becoming increasingly central to
their treatment (Cao, 2010; Kerbel, 2008; Lijnen, 2008). Although
environmental factors such as diet are widely believed to affect
the development and progression of these pathologies, exploration of the link between nutrition and angiogenesis has largely
been confined to correlative studies. These include descriptions
of the effects of gestational nutrition on the placental vasculature
(Belkacemi et al., 2010; Rutland et al., 2007) or the pro/antiangiogenic actions of nutrients and metabolites with a potential
modulatory role in cancer (Adolphe et al., 2010; Kumar et al.,
2013). A tantalizing new study has shown that increasing adipose
tissue vascularization can ameliorate the deleterious metabolic
effects of a high-fat diet, pointing to a central metabolic role for
these vascular changes (Sung et al., 2013). However, whether
modulation of angiogenesis is associated with metabolic benefits remains a controversial topic, partly because it is not trivial
to genetically target the blood vessels of specific organs to
recapitulate the changes associated with certain dietary interventions without affecting other cell types or vascular pools
(Cao, 2010; Lijnen, 2008; Sun et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2013).
Regardless of its metabolic consequences, adaptive angiogenesis is widely believed to be mechanistically driven by
target-derived signals (Cao, 2007; Fraisl et al., 2009).
A close spatial association between mammalian nerves and
vessels was observed as long ago as 1543 (Vesalius, 1543), an
association that has subsequently been shown to result from
mutual guidance or common pathfinding mechanisms during
the formation of the neural and vascular networks (Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005; Mukouyama et al., 2005;
Mukouyama et al., 2002; Quaegebeur et al., 2011). Notably, interplay of innervation and vascularisation of internal organs has also
been described (Davies, 2009). A functional role for these neurovascular interactions was suggested following the discovery that
vessel abnormalities precede a number of neurodevelopmental
and neurodegenerative disorders: an observation that points to

angiogenesis as a therapeutically relevant process (Quaegebeur
et al., 2011; Storkebaum et al., 2011). The question remains
whether, in a reciprocal process, neuronal activity may affect
adaptive angiogenesis. In spite of some intriguing associations
(Asano et al., 1997; Tonello et al., 1999), no neuronal populations
have been identified that effect long-lasting changes in angiogenesis in response to environmental factors.
Drosophila melanogaster has an open circulation, but its
tracheal system has a role analogous to that of the vertebrate
vasculature in supplying tissues and internal organs with oxygen
(Fraisl et al., 2009; Uv et al., 2003). During embryogenesis, developmental mechanisms akin to those discovered in the vertebrate
lung and vasculature make use of signaling pathways such as
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling to sculpt this complex
tracheal network of interconnected tubes (Ghabrial et al., 2003;
Javerzat et al., 2002; Metzger et al., 2008; Uv et al., 2003). These
embryonic proliferative and morphogenetic stages are superseded by a larval period of extensive, but mechanistically less
understood, cellular growth. Growth is particularly prominent in
the tracheal terminal cells: the cells at the end of each airway
that make contact with target tissues and through which gas exchange takes place (Ghabrial et al., 2003; Uv et al., 2003). Like
vertebrate capillaries, Drosophila tracheal terminal cells branch
profusely in response to low oxygen using conserved FGF
and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathways (Centanin
et al., 2008; Jarecki et al., 1999). This hypoxic remodeling has
been assumed to be the only source of tracheal plasticity and,
in normal conditions, the tracheal system is generally believed
to grow in proportion to the whole organism. In this study, we
use a combination of genetic approaches, metabolic profiling,
and in vivo imaging to uncover previously unrecognized
nutritional plasticity in the fly tracheal system. In contrast to the
known target-derived mechanisms of adaptive remodeling, we
find this plasticity to be regulated by a mechanism, previously
undescribed in either flies or vertebrates, involving nutrientresponsive neurons effecting long-lasting and metabolically
significant changes in tracheal architecture.
RESULTS
Branching of Tracheal Terminal Cells Is Regulated in an
Organ-Specific Fashion According to Both Previous and
Current Nutrient Availability
While subjecting wild-type Drosophila larvae to different dietary
conditions, we observed that a severe reduction in dietary yeast
(the main source of lipid and amino acids in the larval diet) was
accompanied by an almost ubiquitous reduction in tracheal terminal cell branching, even when controlling for overall developmental delay by allowing nutrient-restricted larvae to develop
to a comparable stage (Figures 1A–1C, 1G–1I and Figures
S1A, S1C, S1D, S1F, S1G, S1I, S1J, S1L, S1M, and S1O available online). The single exception was the tracheal branches of
the central nervous system (CNS), which were refractory to this
dietary manipulation (Figures 1A and 1G). By contrast, a mild
reduction in dietary yeast neither affected developmental timing
nor led to major changes in the size of organs or that of most
tracheal terminal cells (Figures 1D and 1E and data not shown)
but did lead to a severe reduction in tracheal coverage
70 Cell 156, 69–83, January 16, 2014 ª2014 The Authors

throughout the digestive tract (Figures 1F, S1B, S1E, S1H,
S1K, and S1N). Reduced tracheal coverage was not caused
by cell death (Figures S2A and S2B) and could not be solely
accounted for by defects in gas filling (Figures S2Q and S2R).
Instead, it resulted from reduced tracheal terminal cell branching
(Figures S2E–S2G, S2K–S2M, and S2Q–S2R). To investigate the
reversibility of the tracheal changes described above, we reared
larvae under the mild nutrient restriction conditions shown to
reduce intestinal tracheation and transferred them to more nutritious food immediately after eclosion. Even after 7 days on a
nutritious diet, the intestinal tracheae of these adults flies were
significantly less branched than those of control adult flies
always reared on a nutritious diet (Figures 1J and 1K), indicating
that a defined period of nutrient restriction has long-term effects
on the tracheal scaffold.
Dietary plasticity could be a feature unique to larval tracheae,
given that their branches are undergoing extensive growth. To
investigate whether adult tracheae are also responsive to diet,
we allowed wild-type flies to develop under our standard nutritional conditions and then exposed them to nutritionally poor
or imbalanced diets as adult flies. As Figure 1L shows, a 7 day
nutritional imbalance (9% sucrose) led to increased intestinal
tracheation of the mid-midgut, confirming the dietary plasticity
of the tracheal system also in adult flies.
Collectively, these data uncover previously unrecognized
nutritional plasticity of the insect tracheal system, shaped by
both previous and current nutritional states. The tracheae of
different organs exhibit different degrees of nutritional plasticity;
intestinal tracheal terminal cells are particularly sensitive to a
reduction in yeast availability, while CNS tracheae are preferentially spared.
Differential, Cell-Autonomous Activation of Insulin
Signaling Mediates Tracheal Terminal Cell Growth and
Underlies the Enhanced Plasticity of Intestinal Tracheae
We then focused on the larval phenotypes to investigate the
molecular mechanisms of nutritional plasticity. Hypoxia, the
only known regulator of tracheal plasticity, has been shown
to promote tracheal branching by inducing FGF ligand in
target tissues and receptor upregulation in tracheal cells (Centanin et al., 2008; Jarecki et al., 1999). Although downregulation of
the FGF receptor gene Breathless (Btl) did lead to reduced tracheation in most scored tissues, consistent with the known
FGF requirement for the establishment of the tracheal scaffold
during earlier developmental stages (Ghabrial et al., 2003; Uv
et al., 2003), further attempts to manipulate FGF signaling or to
detect FGF ligand expression and differential pathway activation
under different nutritional conditions all failed to support a role for
FGF signaling in coupling nutrition with larval tracheal growth
(data not shown). These included expression of Btl, constitutively
active Btl, and its ligand Branchless (Bnl) in tracheal terminal
cells and analysis of Bnl and Stumps (a downstream signaling
component) expression under different nutritional conditions.
We then turned our attention to the insulin signaling pathway:
the major coordinator of nutrient intake and tissue size in all
animals including Drosophila (Andersen et al., 2013). We first
suppressed the intracellular insulin signal transducer phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by expressing the dominant-negative

to that observed in these tracheal terminal cells following severe
nutrient restriction (Figures 1G–1I). As in the case of diet, the intestinal branches appeared to be more severely affected by this
manipulation. Because the selective intestinal phenotype was
not caused by stronger GAL4 expression in intestinal tracheae
(data not shown), we tested whether it resulted from increased
sensitivity to insulin signaling. To this end, we made use of an
RNAi construct against the insulin receptor (InR) known to lead
to incomplete receptor downregulation and a milder reduction
in insulin signaling (Slaidina et al., 2009; Willecke et al., 2011).
Driving this RNAi transgene in all tracheal terminal cells led to a
significant reduction in intestinal, but not body wall or CNS,
tracheal coverage (Figures 2G–2I, S3E, and S3F and data not
shown). As in the case of dietary or PI3K manipulations, reduced
coverage resulted from reduced tracheal terminal cell branching
(Figures S2C, S2D, S2H–S2J, and S2N–S2P).
Together, these results confirm the cell-autonomous role for
the insulin signaling pathway in the regulation of tracheal terminal
cell growth and suggest that the enhanced nutritional plasticity
of the gut tracheae is a consequence of their higher sensitivity
to insulin signaling.
Different Tracheal Subsets are Combinatorially
Modulated by Both Systemic and Local Insulin- and
VIP-like Neuropeptides
In Drosophila larvae, nutrient restriction leads to growth inhibition, caused by the reduced release of several insulin-like
peptides (Ilps) from brain insulin-producing cells (the so-called
median neurosecretory cells, mNSCs, represented schematically in Figure 3J) into the hemolymph (Géminard et al., 2009).
A triple mutation of the three main mNSC Ilps (Ilp2, Ilp3, and
Ilp5; Grönke et al., 2010) largely recapitulated the phenotype resulting from expression of PI3K-DN in tracheal terminal cells.
Indeed, reduced growth was observed in both body wall (Figures
3A and 3D) and intestinal tracheal terminal cells (Figures 3B,
3E, and S4A–S4D). However, we found the posterior hindgut
tracheal branches to be spared in these larvae (Figures 3C
and 3F). Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses of
this intestinal portion revealed that these posterior tracheal
branches were adjacent to the two hindgut nerves that run along
both sides of the hindgut (Figures 3K, 3L, and 7B). We have previously shown that axons emanating from a different population
of CNS Ilp-producing neurons, the Ilp7 neurons, contribute to
this innervation (Figure 3J; Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2008) and thus
could provide a local peptide supply to this portion of the gut.
Functional inactivation of the Ilp7 neurons by expression of the
inward-rectifying potassium channel kir2.1 or by expression of
tetanus toxin light chain did not affect most tracheae but led to
reduced tracheal coverage of two portions of the hindgut (Figures 3G–3I, S4E, and S4F and data not shown): the posterior
hindgut (Figures 3C and 3I), where the Ilp7 axons are adjacent
to the posterior visceral tracheal branches (Figures 3K and 7B),

but also the mid-hindgut (Figure S4F), which we had also found
to be regulated by systemic mNSC-derived Ilps (Figures S4B
and S4D). In this latter region, the visceral tracheal branches
emanate from the segmentally repeated main lateral branches
(Figures 7A and 7B) and do not abut the Ilp7 axons, suggesting
paracrine growth regulation.
We then characterized the peptidergic profile of the central
neurons contributing to the hindgut nerves using immunohistochemistry. Four of the eight Ilp7-expressing neurons coexpress
pigment dispersing factor (Pdf) (Figures 4A and 4B): a neuropeptide that shares functional and signaling similarities with
vertebrate vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) (Taghert and
Nitabach, 2012). Four other central hindgut-innervating neurons
also express Pdf and bundle together with the Ilp7 hindgut
nerves (Figure 4B; Talsma et al., 2012). Together, both neuronal
populations deliver Pdf and Ilp7 to the hindgut in a regionalized
fashion: Ilp7 is apparent only in the posterior hindgut, whereas
Pdf is present in both posterior and mid-hindgut terminals (Figures 4C and 7B). Mutation of these peptides, alone or in combination, revealed complex control of different intestinal tracheal
subsets by local Ilp7 and Pdf peptides in combination with the
systemic Ilp2, Ilp3 and Ilp5 peptides (Figures 4D–4U, S5A–S5L,
and 7B): in the posterior hindgut, neither loss of Ilp7 alone nor
Ilp2, Ilp3, and Ilp5 together affected tracheal branching (Figures
4F, 4I, S5C, 3C, and 3F), but loss of all four peptides resulted in
reduced tracheal terminal cell growth (Figures 4L and S5C), indicating partially redundant control of tracheal terminal growth.
Loss of Ilp7 or Pdf alone, or tracheal-specific downregulation
of the Pdf receptor (DSRF-GAL4, UAS-Pdfr-RNAi), resulted in
reduced tracheal growth only in the mid-hindgut (Figures 4G–
4I, 4M–4R and S5A–S5I): a region also affected by the lack of
systemic Ilps (Figures S4B and S4D) and not directly exposed
to Ilp7 peptide (Figure 7B). Finally, mutants lacking both Ilp7
and Pdf displayed reduced tracheal growth in both the mid-hindgut and posterior hindgut (Figures 4T, 4U, S5K, and S5L), indicating that Ilp7 and Pdf act redundantly in the posterior hindgut.
Collectively, neuropeptide mutation and tracheal receptor
downregulation experiments indicate that growth of tracheal terminal cells is directly regulated by the nervous system. The systemically secreted Ilps act as virtually pan-tracheal regulators,
but in some intestinal portions they synergize in a combinatorial—and sometimes partially redundant—manner with locally
delivered Ilp and Pdf neuropeptides.
Exposure to Nutrients and Reductions in Oxygen
Availability Elicit Calcium Responses in the GutInnervating Ilp7/Pdf Neurons
Both mNSCs and Ilp7 neurons have been shown to modulate
feeding responses to nutrient scarcity in adult flies (Cognigni
et al., 2011). However, the dietary dependency of Ilp release
has only been investigated in mNSCs using immunohistochemistry (Géminard et al., 2009). To directly image neural activity in

response to nutrients in vivo, we expressed the genetically encoded green fluorescent Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 (Tian et al.,
2009) in Ilp7 neurons, together with a red fluorescent protein to
visualize the cell bodies. Ilp7 cell bodies displayed some transient
activity in the absence of a stimulus, which rapidly increased
following yeast presentation (Figures 5A, 5C, S6A, and Movie
S1). In most neurons, the frequency and amplitude of the transient Ca2+ peaks increased and then adapted after about one
minute, possibly a consequence of persistent exposure to
yeast. This response was yeast-specific because exposure to
sucrose did not elicit any responses in these neurons (data not
shown), consistent with the yeast dependency of tracheal
growth. It was also specific to Ilp7 neurons, given that GCaMP3
fluorescence intensity was unaffected by yeast in the Capa-expressing Va neurons, used as a control population of six unrelated peptidergic efferent neurons (Suska et al., 2011) (Figure 5A).
The only well-characterized environmental trigger of tracheal
branching is hypoxia (Centanin et al., 2008; Jarecki et al., 1999).
We therefore monitored oxygen-evoked Ca2+ responses in
these two neuronal populations and found that hypoxia led to a
fast and very robust response in the Ilp7—but not in the Va—
neurons (Figures 5B, 5D, and S6B, and Movie S2). This response
was qualitatively distinct from that resulting from yeast exposure.
Indeed, it was predominantly tonic, although some animals
mainly showed transient peaks of increased amplitude, and
lasted throughout the hypoxic period, decreasing slightly over
time. Interestingly, the return to normoxia almost completely
abrogated the basal transient firing of Ilp7 neurons, suggesting
hyperpolarization. This effect was not a consequence of excessive firing and cellular ‘‘exhaustion’’ because repeated hypoxic
stimulation continued to activate the Ilp7 neurons (Figure S6C).
Together, these findings indicate that the activity of the Ilp7and Pdf-producing neurons is increased in vivo by both nutritional cues and reductions in oxygen availability.
Activation of the Ilp7/Pdf Neurons Promotes Tracheal
Branching Locally
Together with previous Ilp/Pdf loss-of-function experiments, the
above experiments suggested that nutritional modulation of Ilp
neuronal activity underlies the nutritional plasticity of tracheae.
To test this idea, we used thermogenetics to achieve persistent,
low-level activation of the Ilp7 neurons throughout larval life by
expressing the heat-sensitive channel TrpA1 from Ilp7-GAL4 in
larvae reared at 25 C. This promoted tracheal branching in a

paracrine fashion; it increased branching of the adjacent visceral
tracheal branch of the posterior hindgut and the tracheal terminal
cells of the neighboring mid-hindgut, but did not redirect those of
the anterior hindgut or other regions (Figures 5E and 5F, and data
not shown). Hence, in addition to being necessary, Ilp7 neurons
are sufficient to sustain tracheal growth in the hindgut.
The Organ-Specific Modulation of Tracheation Is
Metabolically, but Not Developmentally, Significant
The finding that tracheal branching is directly regulated by
nutrient-responsive neurons suggests that tracheal terminal
cells may be used by the nervous system as effectors of
metabolic adaptations to nutrient availability. To investigate
this possibility, we recapitulated the differential effects of nutrient
restriction on tracheae by either reducing tracheal terminal
cell growth in all tissues (except for the CNS tracheae, using
DSRF>btl-RNAi), or specifically in the gut tracheae (using
DSRF > InR-RNAi). Reduced tracheation of all tissues did not
affect larval development (Figure 6A) or carbohydrate metabolism (Figures S7A–S7C) but resulted in leaner larvae (Figure 6C) with reduced lipid stores (Figure 6D) and increased
hemolymph glycerol (a metabolite derived from the hydrolysis
of triglycerides) (Figure 6E), consistent with reduced lipid storage
capacity in the fat body. These larvae did manage to eclose as
adults but were sick and short-lived even in the presence of nutritious food (Figure 6B and data not shown). By contrast, when
reduced tracheation was confined to the gut, no developmental
or metabolic phenotypes were apparent in larvae (Figures S7D–
S7H), and there was no difference in adult lifespan between the
experimental flies and controls on nutritious food (Figure 6F). We
then hypothesized that the specific effect of nutrient restriction
on gut tracheae may fulfil an adaptive role to allow flies to deal
with poor nutritional conditions. To test this idea, we exposed
the DSRF>InR-RNAi flies with reduced gut tracheation to a
low-calorie diet throughout their adult lifetime, and found them
to be significantly more resistant to nutrient scarcity than control
flies: a tracheal phenotype that was confirmed using the recently
published tracheal driver 14D03-GAL4 (Guo et al., 2013) (Figure 6G and data not shown). Metabolic profiling of these adult
flies revealed no differences in carbohydrate metabolism but
showed a reduction in lipid stores in poor nutritional conditions
(Figures 6H, 6I, and S7I–S7L).

DISCUSSION
Nutrient-Responsive Neurons as Effectors of Adaptive
Tracheal Changes
Our work has uncovered a new mechanism coupling nutrition
and metabolism. In response to specific nutritional cues, small
subsets of neurons are activated to regulate tracheal branching
in an organ-specific and metabolically significant fashion. At
least one of the two yeast-responsive neuronal subsets also responds to reduced oxygen—the other environmental modulator
of tracheal branching in flies—so it will be interesting to determine the contribution of these neurons to the previously reported
tracheal adaptations to hypoxia. Importantly, our identification of
a shared neuronal substrate for both nutritional and hypoxic
stimuli is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind in invertebrates
and one remarkably similar to the mammalian carotid body: a
cluster of chemoreceptors that monitors arterial oxygen concentration and nutrient levels to regulate breathing and cardiovascular tone (Pardal and López-Barneo, 2002; Prabhakar, 2000).
Future work will aim to establish whether these Drosophila neurons are able to sense oxygen and/or nutrients directly and
whether they do so using mechanisms akin to those described
in the carotid body. This would lend further support to the existence of an evolutionarily conserved link between oxygen and
nutrient neuronal sensing.
Molecularly, the neuronal control of different tracheal subsets
involves both local and systemic actions of insulin- and VIP-like
neuropeptides: neuronal mechanisms that are particularly complex and combinatorial along the digestive tract (Figure 7) and
that differ from the known adaptive target-derived signals that
sculpt tissue-specific angiogenesis (Cao, 2007; Fraisl et al.,
2009). In this regard, tracheal cells can be seen as ‘‘metabolic
motor neurons’’; as the nervous system modulates motor neuron
activity to regulate muscle contraction, it also modulates the
branching of tracheal terminal cells to control the metabolic state
of cells such as those of the fat body or the gut epithelium. It will
be of interest to investigate whether similar mechanisms are deployed in vertebrates to effect long-lasting, tissue-specific and

metabolically significant changes in angiogenesis in response
to nutrition, in a manner distinct from (but reminiscent of) the
acute changes in blood supply effected by neurons by acting
on blood vessel musculature (see, for example, Matheson
et al., 2000).
Organ-Specific Regulation of the Tracheal System by
Local and Systemic Insulin- and VIP-like Neuropeptides
In Drosophila, previous gain- and loss-of-function experiments
had failed to reveal unique functions for most of the eight
known Ilps (Brogiolo et al., 2001; Grönke et al., 2010). The
regional regulation of tracheal subsets hence provides one
possible explanation for the apparent redundancy of the Ilp
gene family in Drosophila: while all these Ilps may indeed
have the same function (in this case, to modulate tracheal
growth in response to nutrition), they may carry it out in different
places—for example, in the posterior hindgut in the case of Ilp7
and in other parts of the digestive tract for Ilp2, Ilp3, and Ilp5.
This regional control of tracheal growth may extend to other
regions: gut visceral musculature and CNS glia are known
to activate Ilp3 and Ilp2/Ilp6 gene expression respectively in a
nutrient-dependent fashion (Chell and Brand, 2010; O’Brien
et al., 2011; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011). In light of our findings
and the recent discovery that intestinal tracheae can regulate
stem cell proliferation (Li et al., 2013), it is possible that local
regulation of tracheal branching by Ilps contributes to their reported action on intestinal or neuronal stem cell proliferation
(Chell and Brand, 2010; O’Brien et al., 2011; Sousa-Nunes
et al., 2011).
Effects of insulin and VIP on blood vessels have been
described in vertebrates (Chaudhuri et al., 2012; Holzer, 2006).
Indeed, although the effect of Pdf on intestinal tracheal branching is unexpected in Drosophila (where this peptide is known for
its central role in clock neurons; Taghert and Nitabach, 2012),
neurally derived VIP has a vasodilatory effect on the arterioles
of small intestine and colon (Holzer, 2006). However, the physiological significance of these (largely ex vivo) observations has
not been entirely elucidated (Matheson et al., 2000). In contrast
to this mode of regulation, involving acute modulation of endothelial muscle tone, the evidence for longer-lasting effects of
these peptides on angiogenesis—which would be more akin

to their action on the Drosophila tracheal system—is more
tenuous and often contradictory (see, for example, Ogasawara
et al., 1999; Ribatti et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that their
effects may have been underestimated because they act in
partially redundant fashion and in response to specific nutritional
cues. Mechanistically, it has been proposed that the vertebrate
peptides regulate proangiogenic target-derived signals. By
contrast, our tracheae-specific receptor downregulation experiments clearly indicate that these peptides can act directly on
the tracheal cells, so it will be of interest to establish whether
both modes of action contribute to their effects on vertebrate
angiogenesis.

Metabolic Significance of the Tracheal Nutritional
Plasticity
In Drosophila, whole-organism manipulations of insulin signaling
such as ablation of insulin-producing cells or Ilp mutation result
in both slower development and ‘‘diabetic’’ phenotypes, highlighting their dual insulin/IGF-like role (Grönke et al., 2010; Rulifson et al., 2002). Strikingly, downregulation of insulin signaling
only in one cellular target—the tracheal terminal cells—uncouples the developmental from the metabolic phenotypes of these
peptides, thus identifying the tracheal system as an important
and previously unrecognized metabolic target of insulin signaling
in the fly. Hence, the tracheal involvement in previously reported

(B) Illustration summarizing the different kinds of
visceral tracheal terminal cells, their positioning
relative to the hindgut nerves, and their regulation
by systemic and paracrine neuropeptides at
the 3rd-instar stage. In the posterior midgut and
anterior hindgut, there is no apparent dorsoventral
patterning with regard to the positioning of
tracheal terminal cells. In these intestinal portions,
tracheal terminal growth is exclusively under the
control of the systemic mNSC-derived Ilps. In the
mid-hindgut, the visceral tracheal terminal cells
reach the hindgut from its ventral side and extend
branches that eventually cover the dorsal domain.
Mutation of Pdf or Ilp7 alone, as well as the triple
Ilp2,3,5 mutation, all lead to reduced branching. In
the posterior hindgut, where the Ilp7/Pdf axons
abut the posterior hindgut tracheal branches, Ilp7
is partially redundant with Pdf and the systemic
Ilps.

insulin-modulated phenotypes, such as lifespan or resistance to
oxidative stress (Grönke et al., 2010), deserves further investigation. Interestingly, a pan-tracheal reduction in insulin signaling
results in normal carbohydrate metabolism but leads to reduced
adiposity. This is suggestive of abnormal lipid metabolism in the
fat body and is consistent with the recent finding that reduced fat
tissue vascularity leads to fat mass reduction without affecting
glucose homeostasis in young mice (Sung et al., 2013)—
although in both mice and flies this phenotype may eventually
prove to be deleterious (Sung et al., 2013 and Figure 6E).
Reduced adiposity is a phenotype that, although also consistent
with one of the classic symptoms of type I diabetes in humans,
had not previously been observed in flies with a ubiquitous
reduction in insulin signaling or lacking the systemic Ilp peptides
(puzzlingly, these flies were actually found to accumulate triglyceride; Böhni et al., 1999; Grönke et al., 2010). We suggest that

this increased adiposity may have been secondary to the IGFlike effects of Ilps on developmental time, and only by uncoupling
these developmental from the metabolic effects of Ilps, as
we have done with the tracheal-specific reduction of insulin
signaling, can some of the ‘‘true insulin-like’’ phenotypes of
Ilps be unmasked.
We have also found that subtle changes in insulin signaling or
in the nutritional content of the fly’s diet (some of which are within
the range of those normally found in diets used for fly rearing in
different labs) have a striking effect on an unexpected tracheal
population: that of the digestive tract. It will be of interest
to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying their differential sensitivity. These might result from differences in receptor levels or composition—the Ret-like receptor tyrosine
kinase Stitcher, recently shown to synergize with InR in mitotic
tissues, is a possible candidate (O’Farrell et al., 2013).

Figure 6. Distinct Effects on Energy Homeostasis Resulting from Pan-Tracheal or Gut-Specific Reductions in Tracheal Terminal Branching
(A) Reduced growth of most tracheal terminal cells (achieved using DSRF>btl-RNAi) does not affect the time between egg laying and pupation (only the two
controls are significantly different from one another, p < 0.001, n = 40 larvae/set).
(B) This genetic manipulation leads to shorter-lived adult male flies in the presence of nutritious food (p < 0.0001 for all three comparisons, n = 70–120 flies/set).
(C) DSRF>btl-RNAi larvae have an increased length to width ratio (p < 0.001 versus GAL4 control, p < 0.0001 versus UAS control, n = 30 samples/set, total 300
larvae/set).
(D) They also have a reduced fat/protein content ratio (p < 0.0001 versus GAL4 control and p = 0.013 versus UAS control, n = 19 samples/set, total 190 larvae/set).
(E) An increase in free glycerol is also apparent in their hemolymph (p = 0.002 versus GAL4 control, p < 0.001 versus UAS control, n = 13 samples/set, total 130
larvae/set).
(F) A gut-specific reduction in tracheal terminal cell growth (achieved using DSRF>InR-RNAi) does not affect the survival of adult male flies in well-fed conditions
(n = 60–140 flies/set).
(G) The same genetic manipulation leads to enhanced survival when adult male flies are subject to nutrient restriction (p < 0.0001 versus either control, p < 0.001
GAL4 versus UAS controls, n = 110–120 flies/set).
(H and I) The lipid stores of these adult males are relatively normal in well-fed conditions (H, p = 0.001 versus UAS control but not significant versus GAL4 control,
p = 0.002 GAL4 versus UAS controls, n = 7 samples/set, total 70 flies/set), but they are more reduced than those of controls upon nutrient restriction (I, p = 0.002
versus either UAS or GAL4 controls, n = 7 samples/set, total 70 flies/set). See also Figure S7.

Alternatively, it could be caused by differences in downstream
signaling components such as Foxo, which has been shown to
account for some organ-specific responses (Tang et al., 2011).
Functionally, by uncovering gut-specific effects of tracheation
on adult survival and lipid mobilization upon nutrient scarcity, we
have identified the tracheal system as a possible anatomical
substrate for the previously reported effects of nutrient acquisition during developmental and growth periods on a variety of
adult features (Foley and Luckinbill, 2001; Zwaan et al., 1991).
Enterocytes would appear to be the obvious cellular mediators
of these effects; changes in oxygen supply may modulate the
metabolic state of these absorptive cells, and long-term adaptations to nutrient scarcity may result from differential nutrient
absorption and/or utilization. However, enterocytes need not
be the only intestinal targets of the nutrient-driven tracheal
changes: the tracheal regulation of stem cell proliferation
described above (Li et al., 2013) provides an alternative (or additional) target. Consistent with this idea, there is correlative as well
as (more limited) functional data implicating neuronal factors in
the regulation of angiogenesis in tumor environments (Jang
et al., 2000; Madden et al., 2011; Toda et al., 2008). Furthermore,
oxygen need not be the sole mediator of the gut tracheae-driven
adaptations: Li et al. (2013) also found that tracheae produce
Dpp, an important TGFb-like signaling molecule. In future,
it will be of interest to explore not only these intestinal targets,
but also whether the intestinal tracheal plasticity is more
widely regulated by other environmental stimuli—such as gut
epithelial infection or damage. From a more translational
perspective, most studies of adaptive angiogenesis in vertebrates have focused on the adipose vasculature (Cao, 2010; Lijnen, 2008). In light of our Drosophila findings, it will be of interest
to explore the nutritional plasticity of the gastrointestinal vasculature, as well as its contribution to pathologies such as obesity
or to the metabolic improvements following gastric bypass
interventions.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Visualization and Scoring of Tracheal Growth
Tracheae were imaged and blindly scored using DIC optics (see Extended
Experimental Procedures for details). Quantifications were performed as
follows:
Body Wall Tracheae
The stereotypical endings of the third dorsal branch, directly posterior to the
large tracheal commissure on the third segment, were counted as described
in (Centanin et al., 2008).
CNS Tracheae
Tracheal coverage was quantified in the VNC—a relatively flat tissue with
well-defined anatomical boundaries—as the ratio between the total length of
tracheal arbours (which are complex and nonstereotypical) divided by total
VNC area (mm/mm2). Tracheal length was measured using a custom-written
ImageJ macro (Schneider et al., 2012). After median filtering (radius = 3 pixels)
to reduce image noise, a polygonal region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn
to mark the tissue area. Following background subtraction to enhance the
visibility of tracheae, the image was segmented and the tracheal area within
the ROI was measured.
Gut Tracheae
In the mid-hindgut, where the tissue surface and three-dimensional properties
allowed semiautomated quantification, the same procedure as for the VNC
was used, but the segmented image was subsequently skeletonized. Parts
of gut tissue wrongly identified as tracheae or segments of the tracheal tree

missed by the program were manually edited before counting the total number
of pixels in the skeletonized tracheal tree. In other intestinal portions, where the
ruggedness and/or bends and twists of the target tissue made semiautomated
quantification impractical, tracheal coverage was blindly scored using Likerttype scales ranging from no difference to wild-type (3) to strongly increased (5)
or strongly reduced (1) (see Figure 1 legend for color coding of displays). The
validity of this scoring system was confirmed in the body wall and mid-hindgut,
where Likert-quantified scores were comparable to those obtained by counting or by semiautomated quantification respectively (data not shown). Likert
rank data were displayed as the mean (circled) on diverging stacked bar
charts, with the percentage of samples assigned to each Likert rank reflected
in the length of each differently colored segment.
We refer to Extended Experimental Procedures for details of statistical analyses, fly stocks, diets, and more standard methods (immunohistochemistry,

activity).
