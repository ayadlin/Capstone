Abstract
Targeted therapy against the BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a promising new
therapeutic approach for the treatment of melanoma. Treatment with selective BRAF inhibitors results in a
high initial response rate but limited duration of response. To counter this, investigators propose combining
this therapy with other targeted agents, addressing the issue of redundancy and signaling through different
oncogenic pathways. An alternative approach is combining BRAF/MAPK-targeted agents with immunotherapy.
Preliminary evidence suggests that oncogenic BRAF (BRAFV600E) contributes to immune escape and that blocking its activity via MAPK pathway inhibition leads to increased expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDA). Recognition of MDAs is a critical component of the immunologic response to melanoma, and
several forms of immunotherapy capitalize on this recognition. Among the various approaches to inhibiting
BRAF/MAPK, broad MAPK pathway inhibition may have deleterious effects on T lymphocyte function. Here,
we corroborate the role of oncogenic BRAF in immune evasion by melanoma cells through suppression of
MDAs. We show that inhibition of the MAPK pathway with MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
(MEK) inhibitors or a specific inhibitor of BRAFV600E in melanoma cell lines and tumor digests results in
increased levels of MDAs, which is associated with improved recognition by antigen-specific T lymphocytes.
However, treatment with MEK inhibitors impairs T lymphocyte function, whereas T-cell function is preserved
after treatment with a specific inhibitor of BRAFV600E. These findings suggest that immune evasion of melanomas mediated by oncogenic BRAF may be reversed by targeted BRAF inhibition without compromising T-cell
function. These findings have important implications for combined kinase-targeted therapy plus immunotherapy for melanoma. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5213–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma is a major world health problem with an incidence that is increasing at a rate faster than any other solid
malignancy. The overall survival for patients with metastatic
melanoma is poor (1, 2), and novel forms of treatment are
needed.
Key genetic alterations have been identified in melanomas,
resulting in increased oncogenic potential (3). A better understanding of these oncogenic signaling pathways has stimulated interest in therapeutic strategies targeting molecular
mechanisms. Somatic mutations in the BRAF oncogene occur in most melanomas, with >60% of melanomas harboring
an activating point mutation in a specific codon of the BRAF

gene (V600E; ref. 4). This leads to constitutive activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and increased oncogenic potential through a variety of
mechanisms, including reduced apoptosis, increased invasiveness, and increased metastatic behavior (3).
Various inhibitors of BRAF and the MAPK signaling pathway have been tested in clinical trials. Treatment with a selective MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK) inhibitor yielded modest response rates
(12%) among patients with a known BRAF mutation in a
phase II trial involving melanoma (5). Preliminary results of
a phase I/II trial with a selective BRAF inhibitor suggest that
objective responses are seen in the majority of patients
whose tumors harbor BRAFV600E (6). However, even the most
encouraging of these agents yielded a median duration of
response of only 8 months.
Functional redundancy and compensatory activity through
alternate signaling pathways might explain the low response
rates to MEK inhibitors and the emergence of resistance seen
in patients treated with selective BRAF inhibitors (7, 8). To
address these issues, combination of BRAF/MAPK-targeted
therapy with other signal transduction inhibitors or with
conventional chemotherapy has been proposed (9).
Another potential approach involves combining BRAF/
MAPK-targeted therapy with immunotherapy. To date,

one of the most successful forms of immunotherapy incorporates adoptive transfer of autologous T lymphocytes after a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen (10).
However, this type of therapy is limited by the ability to
generate tumor-reactive T cells and by the technical and
financial resources required (11). An important variant involves the genetic modification of patient's peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express T-cell receptors
(TCR) targeting melanocyte differentiation antigens
(MDA) for use in adoptive transfer. This strategy has
shown promise in generating antitumor responses in clinical trials of patients with melanoma (12) but requires
antigen expression by the tumor cells. Other immunemediated approaches such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and cytokines are also available but are associated
with lower response rates (13, 14).
The rationale for combination targeted therapy–immunotherapy is based on evidence that MAPK pathway inhibition leads to increased expression of MDAs (15).
Recognition of antigens (including MDAs) is central to
melanoma immunotherapy. This is supported by findings
that loss of antigen expression can lead to relapse after
immunotherapy (16).
We sought to test the hypothesis that treatment of melanoma cell lines with MEK inhibitors or a specific BRAF
inhibitor would increase the expression of MDAs, resulting
in improved recognition by MART-1–specific and gp100specific T lymphocytes. We analyzed the effect of several
different MAPK pathway inhibitors on T-cell function to
provide a basis for rational combinations of systemic targeted therapy and immunotherapy for melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and tumor digests
Melanoma cell lines 888 MEL, 624 MEL, and 1300 MEL
were provided by the Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute (NCI). Melanoma cell lines SKMEL28, UACC903, and
Mel-Juso were provided by Dr. Hensin Tsao (Massachusetts
General Hospital, Boston, MA). Fresh tumor digests were
isolated from patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled
on a tissue procurement protocol. All cell lines/digests were
genotyped for BRAF mutation. Melanoma lines/digests were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum at
37°C in 5% CO2.
Chemicals
MEK inhibitors U0126 and PD0325901 were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology. The BRAF-V600E inhibitor
PLX4720 was obtained from Symansis.
Quantitative PCR
Differential expression of MDAs in melanoma lines was
validated using Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems) with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
as control. Total RNA (250 ng) was used as template, and SuperScript III Platinum kit (Invitrogen) was used for one-step
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in a 25 μL reaction.

TCR transduction of PBLs
Retroviral vectors with TCR specific for the MART-1 and
gp100 antigens were provided by the Surgery Branch, NCI.
A green fluorescent protein (GFP)–encoding vector served
as negative control. PBLs were obtained from melanoma
patients on protocol and stimulated in vitro and transduced with TCR-encoding retroviral vectors as previously
described (12).
Flow cytometric analysis
Melanoma cell lines were stained with intracellular stains
for MART-1 using a phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and for surface staining of
HLA class I expression using β2-microglobulin. Transduced
PBLs were stained for MART-1 and gp100 tetramer, CD3,
CD4, and CD8. Intracellular staining was also performed
for IFN-γ. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument
(BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Immunofluorescence
Melanoma cell lines were cultured on glass slides and treated as described. Cells were fixed and stained with a monoclonal antibody targeting MART-1 and a FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (Abcam). Images were acquired using a
Nikon Eclipse-80i fluorescence microscope.
Cytokine release assay
IFN-γ release was measured using commercially available
ELISA kits (IFN-γ; Endogen).
Cell viability assay for T cells treated with MEK or
BRAF inhibitors
PBLs were treated for 3 days with either U0126 or
PLX4720. Each cell sample was then collected and assayed
for viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay from Promega.

Results
MAPK pathway inhibition increases expression of
MDAs in melanoma cell lines and fresh tumor digests
Given the critical role of the MAPK signaling pathway in
melanoma, we sought to investigate the role of oncogenic
BRAF in modulating expression of MDAs. We expanded on
prior literature by increasing the number of antigens assayed
and also by testing the effects of treatment with a specific
inhibitor of BRAFV600E. Melanoma cell lines were treated
with two specific MEK inhibitors (U0126 and PD0325901),
and mRNA levels of gp100, MART-1, Tyrp-1, and Tyrp-2 were
analyzed. We observed a significant increase in mRNA levels
for all four genes after treatment with MEK inhibitors,
regardless of BRAF mutational status. In contrast, treatment
of melanoma cell lines with a selective inhibitor of BRAFV600E
(PLX4720; ref. 17) increased antigen expression only in BRAFmutant lines (Fig. 1A). Fresh tumor digests were also treated
with these agents, showing similar results (Fig. 1B). Western
blot analysis showed that suppression of phospho-ERK

correlated with upregulation of MDAs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
There was no change in HLA class I expression (Supplementary Fig. S2). Expression of MDAs was proportionally upregulated in each cell line, although the level of induction varied
significantly between different melanoma cell lines (e.g.,
2-fold induction in 888 MEL versus 100-fold induction in
UACC903), a point that will be discussed further later.

inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4B). To assess the effects on T-cell
recognition of tumors, treated and untreated T lymphocytes
were cultured with treated and untreated HLA-A2 +

with interleukin-2 and OKT3 and treated on days 2 to 8 with
MEK inhibitors or a specific inhibitor of BRAFV600E at the
same drug doses that induced MDA expression. T cells cultured in the presence of U0126 showed a decrease in proliferative response. In contrast, cells treated with PLX4720

Discussion

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

The development of selective BRAF inhibitors for treatment of BRAF-mutant malignancies represents the first
successful application of targeted therapy in melanoma.
Whereas the percentage of patients who show tumor regression early in the course of therapy is high, the proportion of
patients who maintain a response for more than 12 months
is small (6). The mechanism of cell death following treatment
with BRAF inhibitors in humans in not known, but in animal
models apoptosis seems to predominate over necrosis (18). It
is hypothesized that induction of apoptotic cell death with
either targeted therapy or chemotherapy would result in
the release of tumor antigens and effective vaccination of

the host. This might set the stage for more effective treatment with active immunotherapy, such as cytokines or
immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Cytokine-based immunotherapy is associated with durable
complete responses in a subset of patients with metastatic
melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies blocking CTLA-4 are associated with an objective response rate 10% to 15% of patients, and the majority of these responses are durable (19).
Thus, the longevity of clinical response is well established for
this approach, whereas the percentage of responding patients remains low.
In the present study, we provide preclinical evidence supporting the use of combination BRAF-targeted therapy and
immunotherapy for melanoma. We show that MAPK pathway inhibition using a selective inhibitor of BRAFV600E leads
to increased expression of MDAs, conferring enhanced antigen-specific recognition by CTL without compromising lymphocyte function. In contrast, MEK inhibition has a similar
effect on MDAs but deleterious effects on T cells. Clinical
in vivo validation of these findings in patients being treated
with these agents is a critical next step, and these studies are
currently under way.
Further investigation is also required to uncover the mechanism underlying the effect of oncogenic BRAF on antigen
expression in melanoma. Preliminary data suggest that oncogenic BRAF suppresses MDA expression through microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, as suggested by
Wellbrock and colleagues (Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 20).
However, additional signaling pathways are important to
melanoma pathophysiology and may account for the variability in MDA induction we observed across different mela-

noma cell lines. In clinical trials, it will be critical to assay
genetic alterations and status of pathway activation in the
network of pathways beyond MAPK and correlate this with
expression of MDAs, as significant heterogeneity may exist
even among BRAF-mutant tumors. Variability in MDA expression changes with BRAF-targeted therapy will likely identify those patients for whom the addition of immunotherapy
will be most effective. In those for whom MDA expression is
minimally altered, additional signaling inhibitors might be
used to achieve maximal antigen expression. Our data provide a clear rationale for the combination of targeted therapy
and immunotherapy for melanoma and provide candidate
pharmacodynamic markers to investigate in clinical trials.
