Abstract
FRA-1 forms activator protein-1 complexes in association with
members of the JUN family and drives gene transcription.
FRA-1 has been implicated in the development of airway
squamous metaplasia and is frequently overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus and stomach.
We and others have shown a high level of persistent induction
of FRA-1 by lung carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke and
asbestos, in pulmonary epithelial cells. However, the exact
roles of FRA-1 in regulating lung epithelial cell growth and
invasion are poorly understood. To examine this aspect, we
have stably overexpressed FRA-1 in human type-II–like
alveolar malignant cell line (A549) and a nonmalignant
bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). FRA-1 greatly
enhanced the rate of proliferation, motility, and invasion of
A549 and BEAS-2B cells. In athymic nude mice, FRA-1, but not
the control vector, rapidly enhanced tumor formation and
metastasis by A549 cells. In contrast, FRA-1 failed to promote
tumor formation by BEAS-2B. We suggest that FRA-1 can
promote motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent
growth of lung epithelial cells in vitro, but is insufficient for
tumor formation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6204–11]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States and throughout the world. Pulmonary epithelial cells, the
progenitor cell types that are implicated in the development of lung
cancer, are the primary targets of notorious carcinogens such as
tobacco smoke (1). As is commonly held for other neoplasms, the
progression of lung cancer involves several genetic and molecular
changes at the cellular level that begin as epithelial cell hyperplasia,
evolve to dysplasia, and then to a life-threatening metaplasia (2, 3).
Some of these molecular changes include a silencing of tumor
suppressor genes, dysregulation of proto-oncogene expression
and/or activation, and an up-regulation of genes that promote cell
growth and transformation, leading to tumor development (2). In
the case of advanced lung tumors, motility and invasion impart a
metastatic character to the mutated cells, which results in the

spread of the tumor to other organs (3, 4). However, the exact
molecular mechanisms controlling these processes are incompletely understood.
The transcription factors JUN (c-JUN, JUN-B, JUN-D) and FOS
(c-FOS, FOS-B, FRA-1, and FRA-2) constitute a group of ‘‘earlyresponse proto-oncogenes’’ that are capable of forming activator
protein-1 (AP-1) heterodimers in a signal-dependent manner.
These molecules regulate the expression of genes involved in
various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, transformation, inflammation, and pulmonary defense (5).
Abnormal expression and/or activation of AP-1 proteins by
various toxicants and mitogens contribute to the development of
various diseases, including cancer (5). Other studies have shown a
protracted induction of FRA-1 by asbestos, a potent lung
carcinogen that causes mesothelioma. A prominent role for FRA-1
in asbestos-induced malignant transformation of rat pleural
mesothelial cells has been shown (6). In particular, silencing of
FRA-1 expression reverses the malignant phenotype of mesothelioma (7). We have recently shown that FRA-1 up-regulates the
expression of genes involved in airway squamous metaplasia (8).
The expression of FRA-1 is persistently induced in bronchial
epithelial cells by lung carcinogens such as tobacco smoke (9),
tumor-promoting phorbol esters, and mitogens (10, 11). Consistent
with these observations, overexpression of FRA-1 has been noted in
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (12), esophagus,
and stomach (13). The transition from the small cell to the non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) phenotype induced by the H-ras/
c-myc oncogenes is accompanied by specific induction of FRA-1,
suggesting a prominent role for this transcription factor in
maintaining NSCLCs in a differentiated state (14).
Because the disruption of FRA-1 results is embryonic lethality
(15), we have used a human type II alveolar cell line (A549) and
a nontumorigenic bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) to
determine its role in lung cancer development. Here, we report
that ectopic expression of FRA-1 in both cell lines enhanced cell
motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. However,
FRA-1 alone was insufficient for oncogenic transformation of
BEAS-2B cells.

Cell cultures. A549, a human NSCLC cell line that exhibits type II-like
alveolar epithelial characteristics, and BEAS-2B, a human normal bronchial
epithelial cell line immortalized by SV40 T antigen, were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI and DMEM,
respectively, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), unless
otherwise indicated. Cells were transfected with a mouse FRA-1 wild-type
cDNA (16), p53 cDNA bearing mutation in Arg175 to histidine (R175H,
hereafter noted as p53R mutant; ref. 17), or K-ras cDNA (Val12; ref. 18)

cloned into the pCMV-neo mammalian expression vectors. Stable cell lines
expressing FRA-1, p53R mutant, or K-ras mutant were selected in the
presence of 600 Ag/mL G418. Several independent colonies stably
expressing the FRA-1 (hereafter referred to as A549-F1 or BEAS-F1 cells),
p53R mutant (BEAS-p53R), or K-ras (BEAS-Kras) were pooled, and FRA-1
mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
using gene-specific primers (see below). Protein expression was confirmed
by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for human and mouse
FRA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a control group, cells stably
transfected with an empty vector, pCMV were generated and are referred
to as A549-C or BEAS-C.
Gene expression and reporter analysis. Total RNA was isolated from
stable transfectants, and PCR was done using forward (F) and reverse (R)
primer sequences for mouse FRA-1 (F, 5¶-GGCCTCGA-GATGTACCGAGACTACGG-3¶ and R, 5¶-GGCGAATTCTCACAAGGCCAG-GAGTGTAGGAGA-3¶),
h-actin (F, 5¶-GAGAAAATCTGGCACCACAC-3¶ and R, 5¶-TACCCCTCGTAGATGGGCAC-3¶) amplification was used as a reference. The RT-PCR assays
were carried out in duplicate and confirmed in two independent experiments. For Western analysis, a comparable amount of whole cell lysate
(40 Ag) was separated, and membrane was probed with FRA-1 (SC-183) and
FRA-2 (SC-604X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and h-actin antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.).
A reporter bearing seven copies of the consensus AP-1 binding site of
TPA response element (TRE, 5¶-TGACTAA-3¶) upstream of Luc (referred to
as TRE-Luc) was obtained from Stratagene and transfected along with a
reference plasmid pRK.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts from A549-C
and A549-F1 cells were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSA) were done using double-stranded 32P-labeled TRE (5¶-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3¶) and OCT-1 (5¶-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3¶;
Promega Corp.) probes as described previously (8). Nuclear extracts
(2–3 Ag) were incubated with the binding buffer on ice for 10 min before
the addition of 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probes. To determine
the presence of a specific protein in the complex, nuclear extracts were
incubated with unlabeled TRE, anti–FRA-1 antibodies (1–2 Ag) or nonimmune immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 1 h before the addition of the labeled
probe.
Cell proliferation analysis. Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at
a density of 5  102 or 2  103 cells per well in 100 AL medium containing
5% FBS. After 24 h incubation, cells were maintained in culture medium
with or without serum. After 48 h, cell proliferation was assessed with the
CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega).
Cell motility assays. Cells were plated at equal density in six-well
plates and grown to confluence. Wounds were then generated with a
sterile pipette, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, and fresh culture
medium was added. Areas of wound were marked and photographed at
various time points with a phase-contrast microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE
2000-S). A Transwell migration was assessed using six-well Transwell
polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar Corp.) with an 8-Am pore size.
Approximately 2.5  104 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of the
Transwell inserts and incubated for 48 h at 37jC in serum-free medium.
RPMI containing 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom
chamber. Cells that did not migrate through the pores of the Transwell
inserts were manually removed with a cotton swab. Cells that migrated to
the bottom of the membrane were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min and
then stained with 0.01% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. After 10 min
incubation, the filters were washed thoroughly in water and suspended in
200 AL of 5% acetic acid and 5% methanol. Colorimetric readings were
taken at OD595.
Matrigel invasion assays. For invasion assays, modified Boyden
chamber Transwell polycarbonate filters (6.5 mm in diameter, 8 Am pore
size; Costar) were coated with 100 AL of Matrigel (Sigma) at a 1:20 dilution
in serum-free RPMI 1640 and air-dried for 24 h. Cells were placed in serumfree medium for 24 h before experiments. Cells (1  105) were layered in
the upper compartment of Transwell inserts. Medium containing 10% FBS
was used in the bottom wells. Cells were allowed to incubate for 48 h, and
invaded cells adherent to the undersurface of the insert were fixed and

stained, and readings were taken at OD595 using appropriate blank
controls.
Three-dimensional collagen gel migration/invasion assays. Threedimensional collagen gel matrices were prepared using rat tail collagen
type I solution (Upstate Biotechnology) mixed in a ratio of 1:1 with 2
RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. To a 24-well plate, 400 AL of collagen
solution was added and allowed to polymerize at 37jC. Above this collagen
lattice, cells (5  104 per well) were suspended in RPMI containing 5% FBS.
The cells were allowed to attach for 1 h at 37jC. After the incubation,
excess medium was removed, and an upper collagen cast (300 AL) was
layered above the cells and allowed to polymerize at 37jC for 30 min. RPMI
containing 5% FBS was added on top, and the medium was changed every
4 days.
Soft agar assays. Viable cells (5  103) were mixed in the RPMI
medium in 0.5% agar, plated on the top of 1% agar base, and covered
with RPMI containing 5% FBS. Cultures were maintained at 37jC in the
incubator for 15 days. The medium was changed every 3 days, and the
number of anchorage-independent colonies was counted in five random
fields.
S.c. and pulmonary xenografts. Viable cells (2  106 cells) were
injected s.c. into right and left flank of 5-week-old athymic nude (NCr
nu/nu, Taconic) mice (two mice per group). Tumor volume was assessed, as
detailed elsewhere (19), every 2 days for 2 weeks, and photographs were
taken. For metastasis experiments, 5  104 cells were injected into the tail
vein of athymic nude mice ( four mice per group) on day 0. On day 14, mice
were sacrificed, and India ink was injected into the trachea. Lungs were
preserved in Fekete’s solution, images were captured, and visible tumor
nodules were counted as described previously (19).
RNA interference. To silence the FRA-1 expression, cells were
transfected with SMART pool small interfering RNA specific for mouse
FRA-1 (Dharmacon Inc.) or the control scrambled siRNA using Trans
IT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus). After 48 h incubation, cells were
harvested, counted, and seeded for cell invasion assay, Western blotting,
and RNA analyses.
Statistics. Data presented are the means F SD of n independent assays
as noted in the figure legends. Statistical significance was determined using
the Student’s t test. Significance was set at P V 0.05.

Results
Stable expression of FRA-1 in human lung alveolar epithelial
carcinoma cells. As discussed above, FRA-1 is transiently induced
in most cells, but its expression is persistent in malignant tumors.
To mimic the persistent expression of FRA-1 and to define its role in
lung cancer cell growth, motility and invasion, we stably transfected
the human adenocarcinoma cell line A549 with a FRA1-expression
vector (16). We have previously shown that the endogenous FRA-1
expression is low in A549 cells but is strongly induced by mitogens,
oxidants, cytokines, and carcinogens (9–11, 20). Stable cell clones
overexpressing FRA-1 (referred to as A549-F1 cells) or a control
empty vector (termed A549-C) were isolated following selection
with G418, pooled, and used for subsequent gene expression and
functional studies. The overexpression of FRA-1 was confirmed by
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses (Fig. 1A). The A549-C cells
showed little or no expression of FRA-1 (top). Overexpression of
FRA-1 did not alter the expression of another FOS protein, FRA-2
(bottom).
The biological activity of ectopically expressed FRA-1 was
assessed by EMSA using a 32P-labeled consensus AP-1 binding
site. The formation of a constitutive AP-1 complex was noted in
A459-F1 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5) but was barely detectable in the
A549-C cells (lanes 1 and 2). Formation of this AP-1 complex could
be competed out by an unlabeled TRE oligo, confirming its specific
DNA binding property (lane 6). The difference in AP-1 complex

Figure 1. Ectopic FRA-1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. A, total RNA and whole cell lysates were prepared from stable A549-C and A549-F1
transfectants for gene expression analyses and nuclear extracts for DNA binding assays. RT-PCR was done using the FRA-1 or h-actin gene-specific primers (top ).
Equal amounts of whole-cell lysates (40 Ag) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti–FRA-1, FRA-2, and h-actin antibodies (bottom ). B, nuclear extracts
(3 Ag) were incubated with 32P–end-labeled consensus TRE (top ) or OCT1 (bottom ) oligo probes (lanes 1–4 ). In competition assays, nuclear extracts were incubated
without (lane 5 ) or with unlabeled TRE oligo. C, in supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1–2 Ag of non-immune IgG (lanes 1–2 ) or anti–FRA-1
antibody (lanes 3–4 ) for 1 h on ice before the addition of the labeled TRE. EMSA gel exposed to a shorter time (top ) and a longer time (bottom ). Arrow, position of AP-1
complex; *, position of supershifted (SS) complex with FRA-1 antibody. A representative autoradiogram from two independent experiments is shown. D, cells were
transfected with 100 ng of the TRE reporter construct along with 1 ng of pRL-TK plasmid. After 24 h incubation, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was
analyzed. The fold induction was calculated, with the reporter values for the A549-C cells being set to 1.0. Data are means F SD of triplicate from a representative
experiment. Each experiment was repeated at least twice.

formation between the two transfectants cannot be attributed to a
generalized defect in the DNA binding activities of other proteins
in these cells: EMSAs with an OCT-1 oligo probe showed a normal
DNA binding pattern in both these cell clones. The presence of
FRA-1 in the AP-1 complex was confirmed by a ‘‘super-shifting/
blocking’’ of the EMSA band with an anti–FRA-1 antibody (Fig. 1C,
lanes 3 and 4), but not a control IgG (lanes 1 and 2). FRA-1
antibody markedly decreased the formation of AP-1 complex
(compare lane 4 and lane 3). To better visualize supershifted DNAprotein complexes (indicated by star), EMSA gels were exposed for
a longer time (Fig. 1C). In addition, following transfection of TRELuc, which measures the activity of AP-1 (Fig. 1D), a 2-fold higher
luciferase activity was noted in A549-F1 cells (column 4) than in
A549-C cells (column 3). As expected, transfection of the control
pGL3 vector, which lacked the TRE sites, produced similar activity
levels in both these cell types (compare columns 1 and 2).
Overexpressed FRA-1 increases lung cancer cell proliferation and motility. We next examined the effects of ectopically
expressed FRA-1 on the morphologic features and proliferation of
A549 cells. In contrast to the control cell line A549-C, which seemed
to contain compact epithelial cells with a cobblestone-like
appearance, the A549-F1 cells assumed a fibroblastoid shape with
long extended processes (Fig. 2A). Given the importance of cell
proliferation and survival in the regulation of the cancer cell
progression and metastasis, we first compared the proliferation
rates of A549-F1 cells and A549-C under normal conditions and
conditions of growth factor deprivation. An equal number of viable

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

cells were plated at two different densities and cultured in serumfree medium, and the number of viable cells was measured after
48 h incubation. Under these conditions, the cell proliferation rate
of A549-F1 was 9-fold greater than that of the A549-C cells (Fig. 2B).
No significant differences in proliferation rate were observed when
these cells were cultured in medium containing normal levels of
serum (10%; Fig. 2C). These differences indicate that FRA-1 imparts
neoplastic properties to the cells under conditions of growth factor
deprivation. To assess the effect of FRA-1 overexpression on cell
migration/motility, we used ‘‘scratch wound-healing’’ assays. The
cell motility following wound generation was greater in A549-F1
cells at all time points (Fig. 2D). Closure of the wound was almost
complete in A549-F1 cells within 40 h of incubation, but not in the
case of similarly treated A549-C1 cells. These results indicate that
FRA-1 overexpression can lead to potentiation of lung cancer cell
growth and migration.
Overexpression of FRA-1 enhances cell invasion. The
invasion of cancer cells through the basement membrane is a
key event during metastasis. Therefore, we used two complementary approaches to assess the effect of FRA-1 overexpression on
the ability of A549 cells to invade the basement membrane. In the
first approach, cells were plated on the two-chamber Transwell
inserts, and the cellular migration to the lower surface of the
inserts was determined after 48 h. As shown in Fig. 3A,
ectopically expressed FRA-1 greatly increased the cell migration
rate. A 12-fold greater number of A549-F1 cells ( filled column)
than A549-C cells (open column) was found in the bottom wells

Role of FRA-1 in Lung Cancer Development

(Fig. 3B). In a second approach, the invasive potential of both the
A549-F1 and A549-C cells was analyzed using modified Boyden
chambers (Fig. 3C). Cells were placed on the Matrigel-coated twochamber Transwell inserts, and after 48 h of incubation, the
invaded cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The
number of cells that crossed the Matrigel barrier to the lower
surface of the inserts was about 2-fold higher in the case of A549F1 cells (Fig. 3C, filled column) than A549-C cells (Fig. 3C, open
column). These results clearly indicate that FRA-1 overexpression
markedly enhances the invasive potential of lung adenocarcinoma
cells.
The above results show that ectopic FRA-1 promotes malignant
potential of A549 cells. To show that this is a true FRA-1 effect, we
assessed the effect of FRA-1 siRNA on the invasive potential of both
the A549-F1 and A549-C cells using modified Boyden chambers. As
anticipated, the silencing of FRA-1 expression (bar 3) significantly
reduced the invasive potential of A549-F1 cells (see Supplementary
Fig. S1), confirming that ectopic FRA-1 is responsible for inducing
greater level of invasive potential in A549-F1 cells.

FRA-1 promotes anchorage-independent growth. We next
examined the behavior of the stable transfectants in a threedimensional Matrigel invasion assay, a system that closely
resembles physiologic growth conditions. Cells were cultured in a
three-dimensional Matrigel system and observed by phase-contrast
microscopy for 2 weeks. As compared with the control A549-C
cells, the A549-F1 cells formed a higher number of invasive
colonies, which were enlarged and aberrantly shaped (Fig. 4A).
A549-F1 cells more effectively invaded the surrounding basement
membrane matrix; this migration resulted in the formation of a
number of colonies. Similarly, soft agar tumor assays (Fig. 4B)
revealed that A549-F1 cells had an enhanced ability to form
colonies under nonadherent conditions when compared with the
A549-C cells. As seen under high magnification (Fig. 4B, right), the
size and density of the anchorage-independent colonies of A549-F1
cells were generally much larger than those of the parental cells.
This difference could be directly attributed to the increased rate of
cell proliferation caused by FRA-1 overexpression. The number of
colonies generated was five times higher in the case of the A549-F1

Figure 3. FRA-1 overexpression enhances the invasive potential of A549. A, equal numbers of viable stable cell transfectants were seeded on the top of the Transwell
inserts and incubated for 48 h in serum-containing medium. The cells that migrated through the filters were stained with 0.01% crystal violet and examined under
a light microscope. Arrows, cells that migrated to the lower chamber of the Transwell insert. The stained filters were suspended in acetic acid and methanol (1:1), and

cells (Fig. 4C, filled column) than the A549-C cells (open column).
Thus, overexpression of FRA-1 increased the oncogenic potential of
A549 cells, as reflected by a high colony-forming efficiency and
anchorage-independent growth rate.
Ectopic FRA-1 promotes on tumor growth and lung
metastasis potential of A549 in vivo. To determine their relative

oncogenic abilities A549-C and A549-FRA-1 cells were injected (s.c.)
into athymic nude mice, and tumor formation was monitored for
17 days. A549-F1 cells expressing FRA-1 formed large tumors
(Fig. 5A) and grew robustly (Fig. 5B) as compared with A549-C. To
assess whether FRA-1 overexpression enhances metastatic potential, A549-C and A549-F1 cells were injected into the tail vein of

Role of FRA-1 in Lung Cancer Development

athymic nude mice, and the formation of lung metastases were
determined. Consistent with previous reports, A549-C cells formed
some metastases (Fig. 5C). Significantly, A549-F1 cells (30/mice)
formed 3-fold more metastases than A549-C cells (11/mice) in this
model (Fig. 5D). Thus, high-level expression of FRA-1 promotes
tumor growth and metastatic potential of A549 cells.
FRA-1 induces malignant phenotypes in normal bronchial
epithelial cells in vitro, but is not sufficient for tumor
formation in vivo. The above studies were done in A549 cells,
which exhibit type-II alveolar cell differentiation-specific characteristics but possess malignant potential (ATCC). Thus, we examined
the effects of FRA-1 in normal human bronchial epithelial cells,
BEAS-2B. This cell line does not form tumors when injected into
nude mice (ATCC). BEAS-2B cells stably expressing the empty
pCMV vector (BEAS-C) or FRA-1 (BEAS-F1) were generated. To
avoid a clonal bias, all experiments used pools of at least 10 stable
colonies in each case. The expression of ectopic FRA-1 in BEAS-C
(lane 1) and BEAS-F1 (lane 2) was confirmed by RT-PCR and
Western blot analyses (Fig. 6A, left). In transient transfection assays,
we observed significantly elevated AP-1 activity in BEAS-F1 cells
(Fig. 6A, right, column 2) as compared with BEAS-C cells (column 1).
We have used several different methods, including cell motility,
proliferation, migration, matrigel-invasion, and anchorageindependent soft agar growth assays, and in vivo tumor growth
as measures of their transformed phenotype. As shown in Fig. 6B,
BEAS-F1 cells migrated into the injured area faster than BEAS-C
cells were expressing pCMV. When cultured in serum-free
conditions, the proliferation rate of BEAS-F1 was 6-fold greater
than that of the BEAS-C cells (Fig. 6C, left). Transwell migration
assays revealed a greater increase in cell migration rate in BEAS-F1
(6-fold) as compared with BEAS-C cells (Fig. 6C, right). Boyden
chamber assays (Fig. 6D, left) showed that overexpression of FRA-1
greatly enhances the ability of BEAS-2B cells ( filled column) to
invade the basement membrane. The number of colonies obtained
in soft agar growth assays were more than 3-fold greater in BEASF1 cells than BEAS-C cells (Fig. 6D, right).
On the basis of these in vitro characteristics, we measured
invasive potential of BEAS-2B cells. We next examined if BEAS-2B

cells overexpressing FRA-1 have capability to form tumors in vivo
(Fig. 6D). As positive controls, we have used BEAS-2B cells
overexpressing K-ras (BEAS-Kras) or p53 mutant (BEAS-p53R).
Neither BEAS-C (data not shown) nor BEAS-F1 cells formed tumors
following implantation into nude mice (see Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, BEAS-2B cells expressing K-ras
(BEAS-Kras) or p53 mutant (BEAS-p53R) formed large tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S2, arrows) and grew robustly (Fig. 6E). Thus,
FRA1 alone seems to be insufficient for promoting tumor
formation in vivo.

Discussion
The present study investigated the role of FRA-1 in regulating
lung epithelial cell growth and invasion. The results of assays
measuring three-dimensional Matrigel migration and invasion and
soft agar growth revealed that FRA-1 overexpression greatly
enhances both the growth and invasive potential of lung epithelial
cells. We have previously shown that various agents that promote
tumor cell growth and invasion persistently activate FRA-1
expression in pulmonary (type II and bronchial) epithelial cells
(9–11, 20). Thus, the present findings are important in that the
activation of this transcription factor by mitogens and carcinogens
plays key roles in promoting cell growth, malignant transformation,
and invasive potential of pulmonary epithelial cells. Our findings
are consistent with recent experimental evidence obtained from
animal models, in which aberrant activation and expression of
JUN and FOS family members have been shown to play key roles in
the development of tumorigenesis (5). The fact that FRA-1 also
regulates asbestos-induced mesothelioma (6, 7) and is important
for mammary (16, 21), colon (22), and brain (23) cancer cell motility
and invasion further reinforces the significance of the role of FRA-1
in lung carcinogenesis and tumor progression.
In the present study, tumor growth assays done with A549-F1
and A549-C cells have revealed that overexpression of FRA-1
significantly enhances the formation of tumor metastases (Fig. 5B).
Lung tumor nodules formed by the A549-C cell may be attributed
to either endogenous FRA-1 or other oncogenic mutations in the

empty vector (BEAS-C ) or FRA-1 cDNA (BEAS-F1 ) were generated, and the expression of FRA-1 was analyzed using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Right, cells
were transfected with the TRE-Luc reporter construct along with 1 ng of pRL-TK plasmid, and luciferase activity was analyzed as detailed in Fig. 1D . Columns, means of
triplicate from a representative experiment; bars, SD. B, the effect of ectopic FRA-1 on BEAS-2B cell motility was analyzed using scratch wound-healing assays.
Representative picture of three independent experiments is shown. C, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and maintained on 1% serum, and the proliferation
was analyzed after 48 h. Columns, means of eight separate wells (n = 8) from two independent experiments (left ); bars, SD. Equal numbers of viable stable cell
transfectants were seeded on the top of the Transwell inserts and incubated for 48 h in serum-containing medium. The cells that migrated through the filters were
stained with 0.01% crystal violet, and the absorbance was read at OD595. The values of BEAS-C were set as one unit. Columns, means; bars, SD (n = 6; right ). D, the

parent cell line. To determine the role of endogenous FRA-1 in
promoting metastasis, we attempted to ablate its expression using
expression vectors coding for FRA-1–specific shRNAs. However,
none of the shRNA expressing cell lines survived to form stable cell
clones (data not shown), indicating an important role for FRA-1 in
the survival of lung adenoma cells. Therefore, it was technically
impossible to perform tumorigenic assays with A549 cells lacking
endogenous FRA-1 expression. Interestingly, although overexpression of FRA-1 in nonmalignant human bronchial epithelial
cells promoted mitogen-independent cell proliferation, migration
and invasion, and anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 6), it failed
to promote tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 6E), whereas BEAS-2B
cells overexpressing p53 mutant or K-ras induced tumor growth.
In contrast to our results, ectopic expression of Fra-1 in rat
fibroblasts, Rat-1A, results in anchorage-independent growth
in vitro and tumor development in athymic mice (24). This
discrepancy may be due to differences in cell types, species origin,
and genetic constitution of the cells used in these reports. Rat1A is

an immortalized rat fibroblastic cell line (25), whereas BEAS-2B is a
SV40 immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (26, 27).
Nonetheless, our current findings suggest that FRA-1 expression
alone is not sufficient to drive tumor growth in vivo. In support of
this notion, Jochum et al. (28) have shown that ubiquitous
expression of FRA-1 enhanced osteosclerosis, but did not induce
lung tumors. We also found that targeted expression of FRA-1
specifically in bronchial epithelial cells under the control of a Clara
cell-specific promoter formed no detectable lung tumors in mice.5
Previous studies have shown transformability and tumorigenic
potential of BEAS-2B cells with certain oncogenes and carcinogens.
For example, transfection of v-Ki-Ras (29), v-Ha-Ras (30), and a
mutant form of p53 (31) or treatment with a tobacco-specific
carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-I-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (32)

Role of FRA-1 in Lung Cancer Development

induces neoplastic transformation of BEAS-2B cells and tumorigenicity in mice. It is unclear why FRA-1 when overexpressed in nonmalignant BEAS-2B has failed to promote tumor growth in vivo in
athymic nude mice, despite imparting malignant transformationlike characteristics in vitro. It is likely that tumor growth and
metastasis require additional events such as mutational inactivation of either tumor suppressor(s) and/or activation of certain prooncogenes, in addition to FRA-1. For example, several studies have
reported that A549 cells have mutations in the K-Ras oncogene.
Such mutations have not been reported thus far in the case of
BEAS-2B cell line. Mutations in K-Ras have been frequently noted
in lung cancer tissues and cell lines (33), and overexpression of
K-Ras oncogene in mice causes lung tumor development (34).
FRA-1 is a critical downstream effector of Ras-extracellular signalregulated kinase pathway. Thus, it is likely that FRA-1 in
cooperation with an additional oncogene(s) may promote lung
tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, FRA-1 cannot bind DNA on its
own and requires another protein, such as Jun, to bind to the AP-1
sites. Recently, Maeno et al. (35) have shown that overexpression of
c-Jun promotes cell viability and anchorage-independent growth of
BEAS-2B cells. However, no experiments were done to evaluate the
oncogenic ability of these cells in mice in this study. Interestingly,

similar to FRA-1, c-Jun expression using the ubiquitin promoter
in transgenic mice caused no lung tumor formation (36). Thus, we
propose that although FRA-1 or c-Jun expression augments
malignant potential of transformed lung epithelial cells, their
expression alone is not sufficient to promote lung tumor growth
in vivo.
In summary, our findings suggest that the activation of FRA-1 by
carcinogens and mitogens may be a critical determinant of tumor
cell progression and invasion. Delineating the mechanisms by
which FRA-1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis in malignant
cells but not in nonmalignant cells in vivo may provide further
insight into lung cancer development.
