ABSTRACT:
Epithelial ovarian cancer is a highly lethal and aggressive gynecological
malignancy. The high mortality rate is due in part to the fact that many advanced
cancer patients become refractory to current chemotherapeutic agents, leading
to tumor recurrence and death. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to
chemoresistance remain obscure. Here, we report that the loss of miR-199b-5p due to
progressive epigenetic silencing leads to the activation of the JAG1-mediated Notch1
signaling cascade, thereby leading to the development of acquired chemoresistance
in ovarian cancer. Using miRCURY LNATM microRNA array and Q-PCR analyses of two
pairs of cisplatin-sensitive and –resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, we identified
miR-199b-5p as significantly down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer
cells and confirmed that miR-199b-5p is clinically associated with advanced and poor
survival ovarian cancers. Interestingly, the loss of miR-199b-5p could be restored by
5-Aza-dC-mediated demethylation, and methylated specific PCR (MS-PCR), bisulfitesequencing and pyrosequencing revealed that the promoter region of miR-199b-5p
was hypermethylated. Computational and mechanistic analyses identified JAG1 as
a primary target of miR-199b-5p. Notably, the reduced expression of miR-199b-5p
was found to be inversely correlated with the increased expression of JAG1 using an
ovarian cancer tissue array. Enforced expression of miR-199b-5p sensitized ovarian
cancer cells to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, reexpression of miR-199b-5p and siRNA-mediated JAG1 knockdown or treatment with
Notch specific inhibitor γ-secretase (GSI) attenuated JAG1-Notch1 signaling activity,
thereby enhancing cisplatin-mediated cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, our study
suggests that the epigenetic silencing of miR-199b-5p during tumor progression is
significantly associated with acquired chemoresistance in ovarian cancer through the
activation of JAG1-Notch1 signaling.

regimen for advanced ovarian cancer [3, 4]. The clinical

and repetitive challenges of chemotherapeutic agents
leads to the development of acquired chemoresistance
[5]. Such acquired chemoresistance is the major obstacle
to the clinical management of ovarian cancer [6, 7].
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired
chemoresistance remain largely unknown, underlying
the urgent need to identify the associated molecular
mechanisms to explore alternative therapeutic strategies.
Acquired chemoresistance, also called as extrinsic
chemoresistance, develops secondary to genetic and
epigenetic alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
DNA repair, etc., after the administration of repetitive
cycles of chemotherapy [5, 8, 9]. Genetic changes refer
to the changes in the DNA sequence, including mutation,
deletion, amplification, and translocation, whereas
epigenetic alterations include DNA methylation, histone
modifications and microRNA (miRNA) regulation.
Emerging evidence suggests the importance of miRNAs
in developing acquired chemoresistance in various human
cancers [10-12]. The dysregulation of miRNAs alters
a network of functional targets and signaling pathways,
resulting in acquired chemoresistance in human cancers
[10, 11]. For examples, up-regulation of miR-21 causes
acquired trastuzumab resistance by repressing PTEN
expression during long-term exposure to trastuzumab
antibody in breast cancer [13], and the repetitive
application of cisplatin (CDDP) to non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells induces an increase in miR630, which enhances cytoprotection against CDDP and
carboplatin by inhibiting the p53 signaling pathway
[14]. This evidence prompted us to hypothesize that
some miRNAs may be involved in developing acquired
chemoresistance during ovarian cancer progression.
In this study, we used the miRCURY LNATM
microRNA Array followed by a series of in vitro and in
vivo functional and biochemical analyses to identify miR199b-5p as being associated with cisplatin resistance
in ovarian cancer cells. Importantly, our finding
provides a novel molecular mechanism of epigeneticmediated acquired chemoresistance in ovarian cancer
by which miR-199b-5p is frequently silenced by DNA
hypermethylation, thereby leading to the activation of
JAG1-Notch1 signaling in ovarian cancer progression and
acquired chemoresistance.

miRNA array on two pairs of ovarian cancer cell lines
(cisplatin-sensitive: A2780s and OV2008 vs. cisplatinresistant: A2780cp and C13*) [15]. Our results revealed
that there were 35 upregulated miRNAs (>2-fold) and
45 downregulated miRNAs (<0.5-fold) with statistical
significance (data not shown). Among these dysregulated
miRNAs, 21 upregulated miRNAs and 10 downregulated
miRNAs were commonly found in both pairs of cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1). In this study, the downregulated
miRNAs in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells were
studied. Of 10 downregulated miRNAs, 5 miRNAs
(miR-10b, miR-99a, miR-193a-3p, miR-199b-5p and
miR-675) were selected for verification of the response
to cisplatin-induced cell cytotoxicity via transient
transfection of their pre-miRNA-expressing plasmids.
Among these 5 candidates, XTT cell proliferation assay
demonstrated that miR-199b-5p exhibited a remarkable

RESULTS:

(A) miR-199b-5p expression was measured by quantitative RTPCR in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines: A2780s, A2780cp,
OV2008, C13*, SKOV3, OVCA429, OVCA433, and ES-2.
The results are reported as the mean ± SD of three independent
experiments performed in triplicate, ** P<0.01. (B) Comparison
of miR-199b-5p expression in early-stage (Stage I, N=28) vs.
advanced-stage (Stage II, III and IV, N =51) ovarian cancer

by Q-PCR. (C) Comparison of the survival curve of ovarian
cancer patients with high (n=12) and low levels (n=51) of miR199b-5p. The relative expression level of miR-199b-5p (0.024)
was used as a cutoff point. * P = 0.047

increase in the cisplatin-mediated cell cytotoxicity of
A2780cp and C13* cells (data not shown). As miR199b-5p could sensitize ovarian cancer cells to cisplatininduced cytotoxicity, we hypothesized that the loss of the
miR-199b-5p is involved in chemoresistance of ovarian
cancer. To validate this hypothesis, Q-PCR was performed
to evaluate the expression of miR-199b-5p. We confirmed
that miR-199b-5p was downregulated in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells A2780cp and C13* compared with
their chemosensitive counterparts A2780s and OV2008
(Fig. 1A). In addition to these cell lines, the expression
of miR-199b-5p was also reduced in other chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cell lines: SKOV3, OVCA433 and ES-2
[16-18] (Fig. 1A). We observed a trend of progressively
diminishing miR-199b-5p expression (measured as 2-ΔCt)
from early to advanced stages and from low to high grade

ovarian cancer (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the downregulated
miR-199b-5p was significantly correlated with poor
survival rate (P=0.047) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate
that the expression of miR-199b-5p is gradually silenced in
ovarian cancer progression and that downregulated miR199b-5p is significantly associated with chemoresistance
and poor survival of ovarian cancer patients.

Loss of miR-199b-5p is attributed to promoter
hypermethylation in ovarian cancer
Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation
typically silences expression of miRNAs in cancer
progression [19, 20]. To investigate whether the
downregulation of miR-199b-5p was attributed to

promoter hypermethylation in ovarian cancer, 6 ovarian
cancer cell lines were treated with the DNA demethylation
reagent 5-Aza-2’-deoxycitidine (5-Aza-dc). Q-PCR
analysis demonstrated that the expression of miR-199b5p was significantly restored in 5 out of 6 ovarian cancer
cell lines after 5-Aza-dc mediated demethylation (Fig.
2A). Further analysis of the methylation status of the
promoter region of miR-199b-5p was performed by
bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) and methylationspecific PCR (MS-PCR). A CpG island located -6,500 to
-5,000 bp upstream of pre-miR-199b was identified (Fig.
2B). MS-PCR and BGS were employed to evaluate the
DNA methylation status within the CpG islands of the
promoter region of miR-199b-5p in ovarian cancer cell
lines. The MS-PCR results revealed that an increase in
DNA methylation was frequently observed in the promoter
region of miR-199b-5p in chemoresistant ovarian cancer
cell lines (A2780cp, C13* and OVCA433), whereas
increased DNA methylation status could be reversed

with 5-Aza-dc treatment (Fig. 2C). In contrast, less DNA
methylation was observed in chemosensitive A2780s
cells and in SKOV3 cells in which the expression of miR199b-5p could not be restored by 5-Aza-dc demethylating
activity (Fig. 2C). The DNA methylation status of the
miR-199b-5p promoter was further validated by BGS and
pyrosequencing analyses, and the results were consistent
with the above findings (Figs. 2D and 2E). In clinical
samples, pyrosequencing analysis also revealed that DNA
methylation was gradually increased in parallel with the
tumor stage (Stage 2 vs. Stage 3, P = 0.0482; Stage 2 vs.
Stage 4, P = 0.0412) (Fig. 2F). However, due to the small
patient cohort, a significant correlation between DNA
methylation and tumor grade could not be found (Fig. 2F).
Collectively, these data suggest that the downregulation of
miR-199b-5p is attributed to increased DNA methylation
during repetitive chemotherapeutic challenges and ovarian
cancer progression.

Fig 3: MiR-199b-5p sensitizes chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and in
vivo. (A) XTT cell proliferation assay revealed that ectopic expression of miR-199b-5p significantly reduce cell viability from 95-99% to

80-85% in A2780cp, C13*, SKOV3 and ES-2 cells upon cisplatin treatment (3 μg/ml, 24 hours). (B) XTT cell proliferation assay revealed
that depletion of miR-199b-5p increased cell viability from 11% to 25% in A2780s cells and 12% to 88% in OV2008 upon cisplatin
treatment (1 μg/ml) at 24 h and 72 h compared with the negative control. (C & D) XTT cell proliferation assay demonstrated that the
stable expression of miR-199b-5p inhibited cell proliferation by 15% in A2780cp cells and 13% in SKOV3 cells but further inhibited the
cell viability 19-26% in A2780cp and 13-18% in SKOV3 upon cisplatin treatment (3 μg/ml). (E) The focus formation assay revealed that
stable expression of miR-199b-5p caused a 40% reduction in foci formation in C13* and SKOV3 cells and an 80% reduction in A2780cp
cells upon cisplatin treatment (3 μg/ml, 14 days). The results are reported as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments performed
in triplicate, *, P<0.05, **, P<0.01. (F) miR-199b-5p stable expression (C2) and vector control C13* cells were inoculated subcutaneously
into nude mice. The mice were i.p. injected with cisplatin (5 mg/kg) every three days beginning on day 7 when the palpable tumor was
formed. The tumor size was calculated and reported as the mean tumor volume ± SE of each group of five mice. The miR-199b-5p stable
expression transfectant (C2) resulted in a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared with the vector control. Vertical arrows indicate

Loss of miR199b-5p is associated with cisplatinresistant ovarian cancer cells

and miRanda were searched. Among the list of potential
targets, JAG1 was identified as a target of miR-199b-5p.
JAG1 contains a highly conserved miR-199b-5p binding
site at nucleotides 135—141 in its 3’UTR and is a transmembrane protein acting as a key ligand of Notch receptors
in ovarian cancer [16, 21]. To further prove whether
JAG1 acts as a primary target of miR-199b-5p, luciferase
reporter plasmids containing the JAG1 3’UTR wild-type
binding sites pmirGLO-JAG1-3’UTR-WT (ACACUGG)
and the mutated binding sites pmirGLO-JAG1-3’UTRMUT (TCTCAGG) (Fig. 4A) were constructed and cotransfected with an miR-199b-5p mimic (pmR-ZsGreen1miR-199b-5p) in HEK293 cells. The result demonstrated
that co-transfection of pmirGLO-JAG1-3’UTR-WT and
pmR-ZsGreen1-miR-199b-5p could reduce luciferase
activity by 38% compared with the vector control. In
contrast, co-transfection of pmirGLO-JAG1-3’UTR-MUT
and pmR-ZsGreen1-miR-199b-5p exhibited no difference
in luciferase activity compared with the vector control
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, western blot analysis revealed that
the expression of JAG1 was upregulated and was inversely
associated with the decreased expression level of miR199b-5p in ovarian cancer cell lines such as C13*, SKOV3
and ES-2 (Fig. 4C). Enforced expression of miR-199b-5p
significantly and dose dependently reduced the expression
of JAG1 in HEK293 cells as well as in two chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cell lines, C13* and SKOV3 (Fig. 4D).
Intriguingly, the enforced expression of miR-199b-5p
profoundly reduced HES1 luciferase reporter activity in
SKOV3 cells by 35% (Fig. 4E), indicating the JAG1Notch1 signaling cascade could be suppressed by miR199b-5p in ovarian cancer cells. These findings suggest
that JAG1 is a direct target of miR-199b-5p and that
reduced miR-199b-5p and increased JAG1 are involved
in ovarian cancer chemoresistance.
To verify whether the upregulation of JAG1
was attributed to the loss of miR-199b-5p in
ovarian cancer, both in situ hybridization (ISH) and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to
examine the expression level of miR-199b-5p and JAG1,
respectively, on a commercial human ovarian cancer tissue
array (OVC1021, Pantonmics). The results revealed that
low expression of miR-199b-5p (≤2-fold) was significantly
correlated with high expression of JAG1 (>5-fold) (Fig.
4F, N=97, P=0.013). Intriguingly, clinicopathological
analysis revealed that both low expression of miR-199b5p (≤2-fold) and high expression of JAG1 (>5-fold) were
significantly correlated with high-grade tumors (p=0.014
for miR-199b-5p and P<0.001 for JAG1) (Table 1). These
results further indicate that the downregulation of miR199b-5p contributes to the upregulation of JAG1 and is
involved in aggressive ovarian cancer, such as high-grade
tumors.

To study the functional role of miR-199b-5p in the
chemoresistance of ovarian cancer, the pre-miR-199b5p expression plasmid (pmR-ZsGreen1-miR-199b-5p)
was transiently transfected into five chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells (A2780cp, C13*, SKOV3, ES-2 and
OVCA433). Upon treatment with cisplatin (3 μg/ml),
the XTT cell proliferation assay revealed that enforced
expression of miR-199b-5p significantly reduced cell
viability by 15-20% in A2780cp, C13*, SKOV3 and ES-2
cells compared with their vector controls (Fig. 3A). In
contrast, depletion of miRNA-199b-5p in A2780s and
OV2008 by a specific miRNA inhibitor (Ambion Product
ID, AM10553) (Supplementary Fig. S2a) dramatically
increased cell viability from 25% to 88% in A2780s and
OV2008 cells, respectively, compared with their controls
upon cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3B).
To study whether miR-199b-5p is functionally
relevant in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth,
stable expression of miR-199b-5p in A2780cp and SKOV3
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B) was observed suppressed
cell proliferation by 15% in A2780cp and by 13% in
SKOV3 cells (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, upon treatment
with cisplatin, the miR-199b-5p stably expressing cells
in A2780cp (C4) and SKOV3 (C2) exhibited reduced
cell viability, approximately 15-20% compared with the
vector controls (Fig. 3D). By focus formation assay, the
miR-199b-5p stably expressing cells (A2780cp C3 and
C4, C13* C1 and C2, SKOV3 C1 and C2) exhibited 4080% reduced foci formation in both number and size upon
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3E) (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
These results indicate that miR-199b-5p is capable of
suppressing ovarian cancer cell growth and sensitizing
ovarian cancer cells to be cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
To confirm the role of miR-199b-5p in enhancing
the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated
cytotoxicity in vivo, the miR-199b-5p stably expressing
ovarian cancer cell C13* (C2) and vector control were
subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into the right and left flanks
of mice, respectively. The tumor-bearing mice were then
treated with 5 mg/kg cisplatin every three days beginning
on Day 7. On Day 19, the size of tumor from the miR199b-5p expressing cells was profoundly smaller (~70%)
than the vector control (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these
data suggest that the loss of miR-199b-5p is associated
with increased tumor growth and the cisplatin resistance
of ovarian cancer cells.

that JAG1 was upregulated in most ovarian cancer cell

exclusively observed in cisplatin–resistant ovarian cancer

their corresponding cisplatin-sensitive cell lines (OV2008

blotting revealed that A2780cp cells exhibited a higher

JAG1 enhances the chemoresistance of ovarian

in A2780cp (Supplementary Fig. S3B). To examine

28]. Hence, we speculated that JAG1-mediated
Notch1 signaling activity is involved in ovarian cancer
oncogenesis and chemoresistance. To this end, a luciferase
reporter assay for the JAG1 expression plasmid (pCD-HA/
JAG1) and the HES1 luciferase reporter plasmid (pHES1luc) [29] was performed in OV2008 cells. HES1 is a well-

known downstream target of the Notch1 receptor, and
the activation of HES1 represents the activity of Notch1
signaling [30]. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that
transient transfection of JAG1 (1 µg) increased HES1
luciferase activity by 30% in OV2008 cells, suggesting
that JAG1 is capable of activating Notch1 signaling

luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that JAG1 was able to increase HES1 luciferase activity by 30% compared with the vector control in

for cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.

Table 2: Clinicopathological correlation of the
expression of miR199b-5p in an ovarian cancer

DISCUSSION:

tissue array (OVC1021)
Parameters n(=97)

The acquisition of resistance during tumor
progression and repeated challenges of chemotherapy
is the major obstacle of clinical management of ovarian
cancer [15, 31-33]. However, the underlying mechanisms
leading to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer remain
poorly understood. In this study, we identified that the loss
of miR-199b-5p, mediated by increased DNA methylation,
is associated with acquired cisplatin resistance via aberrant
activation of JAG1-Notch1 signaling in ovarian cancer.
Blocking the JAG1-Notch1 signaling axis by either reexpression of miR-199b-5p, siRNA-mediated JAG1
knockdown or treatment with the Notch-specific inhibitor
γ-secretase (GSI) dramatically abrogated tumor growth
and enhance cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and in
vivo in ovarian cancer cells. Our study provides a novel
regulatory circuit in which the epigenetic machinery
silences the expression of miRNAs to dysregulate the
activity of the key signaling pathways involved in
developing ovarian cancer chemoresistance.
Mounting evidence has suggested that the
dysregulation of miRNAs causes aberrant upregulation
of oncogenes or the downregulation of tumor suppressor
genes which in turn leads to cancer initiation and
progression [34-36]. In this study, miR-199b-5p was
identified as a downregulated miRNA from two pairs of
cisplatin sensitive vs. resistant ovarian cancer cell lines
(A2780s vs. A2780cp and OV2008 vs. C13*) [15, 37, 38].
The cisplatin-resistant cell lines A2780cp and C13* were
obtained from repetitive challenges of cisplatin treatment
to A2780s and OV2008 cells. This repeated challenge of
cisplatin treatment mimics the clinical situation in which
the patient is repeatedly treated by cisplatin before they
are in recurrence [39]. Interestingly, the downregulation
of miR-199b-5p was progressively enhanced from early
to advanced stages and low- to high-grade ovarian
cancer tissue samples, indicating that the loss of miR199b-5p is involved in ovarian cancer progression.
Accumulating evidence has documented that aberrant
genetic and epigenetic alterations always occur during
cancer progression, including in the progression of ovarian
cancer [40-42]. These alterations result in abnormal
activation of functional signaling, which in turn leads to
so-called “acquired chemoresistance”. Hence, acquired
chemoresistance is proposed to be a dominant player in
ovarian cancer [7, 43-45]. In this study, forced expression
of miR-199b-5p could not only suppress ovarian cancer
cell growth but also sensitize resistant ovarian cancer
to cisplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. These results
suggest that miR-199b-5p plays a significant role in tumor
suppression by inhibiting cell growth and enhancing the
chemosensitivity of epithelial ovarian cancer.

activity (Fig. 6A).
To further investigate the functional role of Notch1
signaling in the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer, a
γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI XXI, compound E, 10 μM)
was used to inhibit Notch1 activity in the chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells A2780cp, C13*, SKOV3 and ES-2
(Fig. 6B). Upon treatment with either GSI or cisplatin
alone, there was a 5-10% reduction in the cell viability
compared with the DMSO control in four ovarian cancer
cell lines: A2780cp, C13*, SKOV3 and ES-2 cells (Fig.
6C). However, when the cells were co-treated with
GSI and cisplatin together, we observed the synergistic
enhancement of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, with a
17-38% reduction in the cell viability of all four ovarian
cancer cell lines (Fig. 6C). To further explore whether
blocking Notch1 signaling could enhance cisplatinmediated cell cytotoxicity in vivo, 5-week BALB/
cAnN nude mice were subcutaneously injected with the
chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell line ES-2. When the
tumors were palpable on Day 7, the mice were randomly
divided into 4 groups. Each group was administered one
treatment by intraperitoneal injection every two days:
DMSO, GSI (200 μg/kg), cisplatin (5 mg/kg) or GSI (200
μg/kg) combined with cisplatin (5 mg/kg). When the mice
were treated with GSI or cisplatin alone, the tumor growth
was inhibited by 20% and 45%, respectively, compared
with DMSO group (Fig. 6D). However, co-treatment
with GSI and cisplatin synergistically enhanced cisplatininduced cytotoxicity, resulting in a 73% reduction in
tumor growth on day 18 (Fig. 6D). These results indicate

MiR-199b-5p was progressively downregulated
from early to advanced stage and low- to high-grade
ovarian cancer, suggesting that the loss of miR-199b-5p
is the gradual result of epigenetic silencing mechanisms
such as hypermethylation. Indeed, DNA hypermethylation
has been frequently reported to silence tumor suppressor
miRNAs in various human cancers, including ovarian
cancer [46, 47]. For instance, downregulation of the miR34 family is induced by promoter hypermethylation and
leads to the pathological progression of epithelial ovarian
cancer [48]. Our results demonstrate that the expression of
miR-199b-5p could be restored in 5 out of 6 ovarian cancer
cell lines using 5-Aza-dC-mediated DNA demethylation.
MS-PCR, BGS and pyrosequencing analyses further
confirmed that an increase in the DNA methylation of the
promoter of miR-199b-5p in ovarian cancer cell lines.
More importantly, although there is a limited number of
ovarian cancer samples for pyrosequencing analysis, our
data suggests that there is a progressive increase in DNA
methylation that is inversely correlated with the expression
of miR-199b-5p during the progression of ovarian cancer.
Therefore, these findings support our hypothesis that
the loss of miR-199b-5p is attributed to increased DNA
methylation during tumor progression and repetitive
treatment of chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.
Dysregulation of the JAG1-Notch1 signaling
cascade has been shown to activate a wide range of
oncogenes in the HES, HEY and MYC families, thereby
leading to ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance
[21, 49, 50]. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the
standard first-line regimen for ovarian cancer patients
with advanced-stage disease. Cisplatin is the most
common platinum-based compound capable of causing
inter- and intra-strand DNA crosslinks that induces cell
apoptosis with DNA damage [51, 52]. Previous studies
have proposed that the aberrant activation of the JAG1Notch1 signaling pathway may protect cancer cells from
cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis and that the signaling
activity is inversely correlated with the cisplatin sensitivity
of human cancers [53-57]. Moreover, Notch signaling
is associated with tumor growth and angiogenesis [58,
59]. A recent study has suggested that the modulation
of tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGF signaling
could reduce the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer
[60], suggesting that JAG1/NOTCH1/neovascularization
confers ovarian cancer chemoresistance. Indeed, our work
provides compelling evidence that overexpressed JAG1
could enhance ovarian cancer cell proliferation, whereas
depletion of JAG1 by siRNAs or suppression of Notch1
signaling by γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) could sensitize
chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity by in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting that
the JAG1-Notch1 signaling axis plays a critical role in the
development of ovarian cancer chemoresistance.
Recent studies have reported that the expression of
JAG1 is modulated by miRNAs. For instance, JAG1 could
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be repressed by miR-34b in estrogen-dependent breast
cancer cells [61] and by miR-524-5p in glioma [62]. In
this study, miR-199b-5p was identified as another novel
miRNA regulating the expression of JAG1 in ovarian
cancer. We demonstrated that the forced expression of
miR-199b-5p could suppress ovarian cancer cell growth
and sensitize the cells to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
On the other hand, as a direct target of miR-199b-5p in
ovarian cancer cells, JAG1 depletion by siRNAs also
resulted in cell growth retardation and sensitization to
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, activating
Notch1 signaling by JAG1 or repressing miR-199b-5p
by anti-miR-199b-5p could induce the activity of JAG1Notch1 signaling in ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, this
study suggests that the loss of miR-199b-5p increased
the activation of JAG1-Notch1 signaling, which in turn
promoted ovarian cancer progression and acquired
chemoresistance. Thus far, this is the first report, to our
knowledge, that the miR-199b-5p-JAG1-Notch1 signaling
pathway is a novel regulatory circuit for acquired
chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.
In conclusion, the findings in this study enhance
our understanding of acquired chemoresistance in
ovarian cancer during tumor progression or repetitive
platinum-based chemotherapy. The epigenetic silencing
of miR-199b-5p may at least partly activate JAG1-Notch1
signaling activity and promote acquired chemoresistance
in ovarian cancer. Therefore, targeting the miR-199b-5pJAG1-Notch1 regulatory circuit might be a therapeutic
approach in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

This assay amplifies a region of 357bp in advanced of
miR-199b-5p (position -6,389 – -6,033), which includes
ten CpG sites to be analyzed. These ten CpG sites were
included in the BGS region.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was evaluated by XTT assay and
Focus formation assay. Approximately 2,000—3,000 cells
were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate. The medium
was refreshed 24 hours after cell seeding containing
appropriate concentration of cisplatin or γ–secretase
inhibitor. XTT was measured by Cell Proliferation Kit II
(Roche Biosciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For focus formation
assay, 5000 cells with stable expression of miRNA or
control vector were seeded into 6-well plates. The medium
was replaced with fresh medium containing appropriate
concentration of cisplatin 24 hours after cell seeding
and grew for about 14 days during which fresh medium
containing cisplatin was refreshed for every 4 days. Cells
were stained with 1% crystal violet (Sigma-Alrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Numbers of foci were counted after
the cells dried. Experiments were performed in triplicates
and results were expressed as the mean ± SD.

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA from cell lines and primary cancer tissue
samples was prepared by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen
Life Technology). First-strand complementary DNA
was synthesized and quantitative reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction was done using the miRCURY
LNATM Universal RT miRNA PCR Kit (Product No.
203450, Exiqon, Denmark) in an ABI 7500 system
(Applied Biosystems). The miR-199b-5p probes were
obtained from Exiqon (Product No. 204152). Each
sample was performed in triplicate and normalized
with human SNORD48 (Product No. 203903, Exiqon,
Denmark). Bisulfite conversion, Methylation specific
PCR (MS-PCR), Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing (BGS)
and pyrosequencing analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) in ovarian
cancer cell lines and cancer samples. The genomic DNA
was then applied for bisulfite conversion using the EZ
DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Orange,
California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The MS-PCR and BGS sequence was amplified
by MyTaqTM HS Mix Reaction Buffer (Bioline, London,
UK). The BGS amplified PCR products were cloned
into the Topo TA vector (Bioline). Colonies were
randomly picked for mini preparation and sequencing.
The primers and PCR conditions for MSP and BGS
are listed in (Supplementary Table 2.) Pyrosequencing
assays were designed using PSQ Assay Design Software
(version 1.0.6, Biotage). The primers for amplifying the
pyrosequencing region of miR-199b-5p were forward

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase constructs were made by ligating
oligonucleotides containing the wild-type (WT) or
mutant sites (MUT) of the 3’UTR of JAG1 gene (position
135—141) into the multi-cloning site of the pmirGLO
plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) (Supplementary Table
3). HEK293 cells were seeded into a 24-well plate and
co-transfected with 100 ng pmirGLO-JAG1 plasmid,
pmR-199b plasmid and pmR-ZsGreen1 empty vector
for balance (400 ng in total), using LipofectamineTM
2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was determined
by the Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) 48 h after
transfection using a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer
F-4500 (Promega).

Western Blot
Cells were harvested and lysed by RIPA Buffer
(Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MD, USA). Samples
containing equal amounts of protein were separated
by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P
Transfer Membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford,
MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% no-fat milk,
followed by incubation with antibodies specific for
anti-JAG1 (1:500, 28H8, Cell Signaling Technology,

Statistical analysis

situ

Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS
14.0 (SPSS). Student’s t-test and the Mann–Whitney
test were used. The results were expressed as mean ±
SD. χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the
association of miR-199b-5p and JAG1 gene expression
and clinicopathological parameters. Differences were
considered significant when p ≤ 0.05.

The commercial tissue array slide (OVC1021,
Pantomics) was deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
in alcohol, then immersed in sodium citrate buffer (pH6)
and boiled in boiled water for 20 minutes. 0.3% hydrogen
peroxidase (H2O2) was used to inhibit endogenous
peroxidase. 10% normal rabbit serum was applied for
blocking non-specific bindings for 45 minutes. Following
this, slides were incubated with primary antibodies antiJAG1 monoclonal antibody (1:100) at predetermined
dilutions at 4°C overnight. 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T)
was used to wash the slides for three times. Staining
was carried out following standard streptavidin-biotinperoidase complex method. Mayer’s hematoxylin was
used for counterstained. Two independent investigators
were invited to review counterstained slides. Scores were
then given to the stained slides according to the intensity
and the percentage of the stained tissues.
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed to
evaluate the miR-199b-5p expression in a commercial
tissue array (OVC1021, Pantomics) using the miRCURY
LNATM microRNA ISH Optimization Kit 5 (FFPE)
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). In brief, the tissue array
slide was deparaffinized and incubated with 20 μg/ml
Proteinase-K for 40 minutes at 37°C. Following this,
the slide was dehydrated and hybridized with specific
miR-199b-5p probe (1:500) at 50°C overnight. After
hybridization, the slide was incubated with anti-DIG
reagent (sheep anti-DIG-AP at 1:400) for 60 minutes at
room temperature and applied to freshly prepared AP
substrate and incubated for 2 hours at 30°C in a dark,
humidifying chamber. Finally, it was stained for nuclear
counter and mounted with mounting medium (Eukitt®).
The precipitate was allowed to settle overnight and the
results were analyzed by light microscopy on the next day.
