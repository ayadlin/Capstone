Abstract
The high incidence of resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and severe side effects of chemotherapy
have led to a search for biomarkers able to predict which
patients are most likely to respond to therapy. ERCC1-XPF
nuclease is required for nucleotide excision repair of helixdistorting DNA damage and the repair of DNA interstrand
crosslinks. Thus, it is essential for several pathways of repair
of DNA damage by cisplatin and related drugs, which are
widely used in the treatment of non–small cell lung carcinoma
and other late-stage tumors. Consequently, there is tremendous interest in measuring ERCC1-XPF expression in tumor
samples. Many immunohistochemistry studies have been
done, but the antibodies for ERCC1-XPF were not rigorously
tested for antigen specificity. Herein, we survey a battery of
antibodies raised against human ERCC1 or XPF for their
specificity using ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells as a negative
control. Antibodies were tested for the following applications:
immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation from cell extracts,
immunofluorescence detection in fixed cells, colocalization
of ERCC1-XPF with UV radiation–induced DNA damage in
fixed cells, and immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded
samples. Although several commercially available antibodies
are suitable for immunodetection of ERCC1-XPF in some
applications, only a select subset is appropriate for detection
of this repair complex in fixed specimens. The most commonly
used antibody, 8F1, is not suitable for immunodetection in
tissue. The results with validated antibodies reveal marked
differences in ERCC1-XPF protein levels between samples and
cell types. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6831–8]

Introduction
It is important to identify molecular markers that help guide
cancer treatment decisions to improve patient survival and quality
of life in advanced-stage disease. Non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC), accounting for f85% of all lung cancers in the United
States, is a prime example. The overall 5-year survival rate is only
17% largely because NSCLC is rarely detected before dissemination

and current methods of screening are ineffective (1, 2). Platinumbased chemotherapy can improve survival when used as adjuvant
therapy after surgical resection of NSCLC (3, 4). For patients with
stage IIIB or IV disease, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the first line of treatment (5, 6). However, this is effective in
only a subset of patients. Prediction of which patients are most
likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy is therefore
imperative.
Cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] and related platinumbased drugs inhibit cell proliferation because they cause DNA
damage, including adducts on single bases, intrastrand crosslinks
between two bases, and interstrand crosslinks between DNA
strands (7). The monoadducts and intrastrand crosslinks are
repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER), a DNA repair
mechanism that excises helix-distorting lesions affecting one DNA
strand. Interstrand crosslinks are repaired by mechanisms that
remain poorly defined but involve proteins from multiple DNA
repair pathways including homologous recombination (8), Fanconi
anemia (9, 10), translesion polymerases, and nucleotide excision
repair (11). ERCC1-XPF is a structure-specific nuclease that acts in
both nucleotide excision repair (12) and the repair of interstrand
crosslinks (8). Thus, ERCC1-XPF is uniquely important for
protection against the cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin-induced
DNA damage. If ERCC1-XPF levels vary between tumors, it would
be an attractive target for use as a predictor of the efficacy of
platinum-based chemotherapy.
XPF harbors the catalytic domain in the heterodimeric nuclease
(13) and ERCC1 is required for DNA binding (14). The levels of
ERCC1 are reduced in XPF-deficient mammalian cells and vice
versa, suggesting that the proteins stabilize one another in vivo
(15). Due to the obligate nature of this partnership, it follows that
cellular levels of the two proteins should be closely correlated and
that either could potentially be a good biomarker of the response
to platinum-based therapy.
There has been increasing interest in measuring the levels of
ERCC1 in NSCLC specimens by immunohistochemistry (16–19).
ERCC1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry, was
reported to correlate with poor response to cisplatin chemotherapy
and significantly decreased survival (17). On the other hand, it has
also been reported that increased ERCC1 in tumours was
associated with longer survival after surgical treatment of NSCLC
(16, 19). Unfortunately, the antibody (8F1) used in almost all studies
is not specific for ERCC1 (20). It recognizes human ERCC1, but also
a second major nuclear antigen of unknown identity, and the
antibody is unable to discriminate between cells expressing
ERCC1-XPF and cells that do not (20).
To determine if ERCC1-XPF is a biomarker for prognosis and
making therapeutic decisions in NSCLC or other types of cancer,

Figure 1. Immunodetection of ERCC1-XPF in WCE. A, examples of how each of the test antibodies was screened for specificity for ERCC1 or XPF by immunoblot.
WCE were prepared from normal (C5RO), XPA mutant (XP25RO), XPF mutants (XP51RO and XP2YO), or ERCC1 mutant (165TOR) human fibroblasts.
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified on the blot by loading recombinant His-tagged ERCC1-XPF. Blots were immunostained with each of the test
antibodies (e.g., anti-XPF: 4H4 and 3F2; and anti-ERCC1: 3H11, D-10, and 8F1). Tubulin was used as a loading control. Asterisk, degradation products of
ERCC1 or XPF detected by all antibodies; question mark, an unidentified spurious band detected only by the 8F1 antibody. B, 8F1, but not D-10 or 3H11, detects a band
that migrates more slowly than ERCC1 (question mark ). This antigen is found in fibroblasts (C5RO and XP2YO) but not in HeLa cells. C, two examples of
screening the test antibodies for their ability to detect ERCC1 or XPF in mouse or hamster cell extracts. Lysates were prepared from wild-type (IB10) and Ercc1 -/- mouse
embryonic stem (ES ) cells (clone 49) as well as wild-type (AA8), Ercc1 mutant (43-3B), and Xpf mutant (UV47) Chinese hamster ovary cells. These were run on
SDS-PAGE along with recombinant His-tagged ERCC1-XPF. Blots were immunostained with each of the test antibodies (e.g., anti-XPF RA-1 and anti-ERCC1 D-10).
Tubulin was used as a loading control. D, immunoprecipitation of ERCC1-XPF from WCE from normal human fibroblasts with each of the test antibodies.
Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and immunostained with antibody Ab-1 to detect XPF protein.

the specificity of relevant antibodies must be critically evaluated.
Here we examine a collection of antibodies raised against each
subunit of the nuclease for their ability to specifically detect their
respective antigens in several applications. This not only provides
reliable tools for the detection of ERCC1 and XPF in clinical
specimens but also illustrates a strategy for the validation of other
antibodies against other potential biomarkers that could stratify
patients according to cancer risk, response to therapy, and
prognosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, recombinant proteins, and whole-cell extract preparation. Primary human fibroblast cell lines C5RO (normal), XP51RO (XPF
mutant; ref. 21), 165TOR (ERCC1 mutant; ref. 22), and XP25RO (XPA
mutant) were cultured in Ham’s F-10 with 10% fetal bovine serum,
antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids. Transformed human fibroblasts
XP2YO (XP-F; ref. 23) were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum,

antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines
AA8 (wild-type; ref. 24), UV47 (Xpf mutant), and 43-3B (Ercc1 mutant;
ref. 25) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics,
and nonessential amino acids. Mouse embryonic stem cell lines IB10 (wildtype) and clone 49 (Ercc1 / ; ref. 26) were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of
DMEM and Buffalo rat liver cell conditioned medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum, antibiotics, nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and leukemic inhibitory factor (1,000 units/mL; Life Technologies).
Recombinant XPF with a NH2-terminal His tag and ERCC1 with a COOHterminal His tag were expressed from a dicistronic construct in Escherichia
coli and purified as described previously (27). For preparation of whole-cell
extracts (WCE), cells were grown to 80% to 90% confluence in 10 cm dishes
or 75 cm2 flasks, trypsinized and washed with PBS, and then lysed at
4jC for 30 min with NP-40 lysis buffer [1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor
cocktail set III (Calbiochem)].
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. For immunoblotting,
50 Ag total protein from each WCE and 20 ng recombinant His-tagged
ERCC1 and XPF were boiled in 4 loading buffer [0.25 mol/L Tris-HCl

(pH 8.5), 8% SDS, 1.6 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mol/L DTT, 0.04% bromophenol
blue, and 40% glycerol], separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel),
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-ERCC1 and anti-XPF
antibodies (listed in Supplementary Table S1) were tested for their ability to
specifically detect the respective proteins.
For immunoprecipitation, WCE of C5RO cells were precleared for 30 min
by incubation with protein A + G agarose beads (Calbiochem) and
incubated at 4jC with 10 AL of each of the primary antibodies and 25 AL
protein A + G beads with continuous mixing for 12 h. The beads were
collected by centrifugation at maximum speed (15 min), washed three times
each with the NP-40 lysis buffer and PBS, boiled for 10 min in protein
loading buffer, and eluted proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated XPF was detected with anti-XPF antibody (Ab-1; 1:1,000;
Neomarkers) and AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(1:7,500; Promega).
Immunofluorescence and UV-C–induced local damage. C5RO and
XP2YO cells were plated at 75% to 80% confluence and labeled with 3 and
0.6 Am diameter latex beads (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, as described
(28, 29). After 24 h, cells were washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and
coplated on coverslips. Twelve hours later, the cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde (ICN Biomedicals) at 37jC for 15 min. Triton-X-100 (0.2%
in PBS) was used to permeabilize the cells and 5% bovine serum albumin in
PBS was used for blocking. Primary antibodies were used as described in
Supplementary Table S2. Goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000), chicken anti-rabbit
IgG (1:1,000), goat anti-mouse IgG2b (1:500), or goat anti-mouse IgG1
(1:500) secondary antibodies conjugated either with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594
(Invitrogen) were used for visualization.
For colocalization of ERCC1-XPF with UV-C radiation–induced cyclopyrimidine dimers (CPD), experiments were done as described (30, 31) with
minor modifications. C5RO cells grown on glass coverslips were irradiated
with 60 J/m2 UV through Isopore membrane filters (Millipore) with 8 Am
pores to induce subnuclear domains of DNA damage. The cultures were
then incubated in medium for 45 min to allow initiation of DNA repair and
then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde with 0.15% Triton X-100 for 15 min on
ice. Samples were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min
at room temperature and incubated with anti-ERCC1 or anti-XPF
antibodies at the same dilution as for immunofluorescence (Supplementary
Table S2) for 90 min at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were used
as described above. This was followed by fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, denaturation with 2 N HCl for 5 s, and blocking with 5%
bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min, all at room temperature. Cells
were stained secondarily for CPD using mouse anti-thymine dimer antibody
(1:200; Kamiya Biomedical) for 90 min at room temperature and either
Alexa Fluor 488 or 594–conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(1:500; Invitrogen).
Immunohistochemistry. C5RO, HeLa, XP42RO, XP51RO, 165TOR, and
XP2YO cells were grown to 75% to 80% confluence, fixed at room
temperature with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 15 min, and then
collected by scraping. Cells were stored in neutral buffered formalin at 4jC
for at least 3 h, pelleted by centrifugation (1,200 rpm, 5 min), and washed
twice with PBS. Cells were resuspended in 500 AL of 80% ethanol,
transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 300 AL of solidified 1% low
melting point agarose in PBS, and repelleted. The ethanol was aspirated and
the bottoms of the tubes were cut off. The agarose plugs containing the cells
were pushed and molded into the caps of Eppendorf tubes and snap frozen
on dry ice. The solidified pellets were extruded from the caps and paraffinembedded according to standard methods for tissue.
For immunohistochemical staining of the cell plug and paraffinembedded tissue sections, antigen retrieval was carried out at pH 6
(DAKO Target retrieval solution; DAKO) at 95jC for 20 min. Samples were
blocked with 20% swine serum for 30 min and then incubated with either
FL297 (anti-ERCC1, rabbit polyclonal, 1:250) or 3F2 (anti-XPF, mouse
monoclonal, 1:1,000) for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibody
signal was then detected using biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
secondary antibody for 30 min and DAB+ for 5 min at room temperature
(Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories). Hematoxylin was used for
counterstaining.

Results
A panel of antibodies against human ERCC1 and XPF, including
commercially available reagents and those from our laboratory
(Supplementary Table S1), were tested for their specificity in
immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and
immunohistochemistry.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Antibodies were
first screened for their specificity for ERCC1 or XPF by
immunoblotting. Normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient human fibroblasts were lysed and immunoblotted along with recombinant Histagged ERCC1 and XPF proteins (Fig. 1A). Antibodies were
categorized as specific for their target protein if they (a) detected
a band of the appropriate molecular weight (f116 kDa for XPF
and 37 kDa for ERCC1) in normal cells (C5RO) and in XPA mutant
cells (XP25RO), (b) detected the recombinant protein (slightly
retarded in its migration due to the His tag), (c) showed
significantly reduced or no signal in ERCC1 (165TOR) and XPF
(XP2YO and XP51RO) mutant cell lines, and (d) did not detect
additional bands of the incorrect molecular weight in both normal
and mutant cells (results summarized in Supplementary Table S1).
All of the antibodies screened were specific for ERCC1 or XPF on
immunoblotting (e.g., 3H11 and D-10 for ERCC1 and 4H4 and 3F2
for XPF in Fig. 1A), except for 8F1, which detected ERCC1 and an
additional, spurious band of f45 kDa. The spurious band is of
equal intensity in normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells (Fig. 1A,
bottom left; ref. 20). Importantly, the spurious band picked up by
8F1 is detected in extracts from fibroblast cell lines, but not HeLa
cell extracts (Fig. 1B, question mark), which were used previously as
a negative control for immunodetection of ERCC1 (32). All of the
antibodies also detected degradation products of XPF or ERCC1
in cell lines with abundant ERCC1-XPF expression (Fig. 1A-C,
asterisk). The optimal dilution of each antibody for immunoblotting was determined (Supplementary Table S2).
To further test the utility of these antibodies, WCE from wildtype and ERCC1-XPF–deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (IB10
and clone 49, respectively) and Chinese hamster ovary cells [AA8,
43-3B (Ercc1 mutant), and UV47 (Xpf mutant)] were also
immunoblotted (Fig. 1C). In general, cross-reactivity for mouse
and hamster proteins was poor (Supplementary Table S1). The only
commercially available antibody that detected rodent ERCC1 was
D-10 (Fig. 1C).
Each of the ERCC1 and XPF antibodies were screened for their
ability to immunoprecipitate their respective antigen from WCE of
normal cells (Fig. 1D). The precipitates were all probed for XPF
using antibody Ab-1. XPF was detected in all samples precipitated
with antibodies against XPF, as well as antibodies against its
obligate binding partner ERCC1, as expected (20). Immunoblotting
for XPF showed that all antibodies tested were able to
immunoprecipitate the ERCC1-XPF nuclease, indicating that each
is appropriate for this application (Supplementary Table S1).
Immunofluorescence. Antibodies that recognize denatured
protein in immunoblots do not always detect their antigen in cells
or tissues fixed with formaldehyde. Thus, each of the ERCC1 and
XPF antibodies were screened for their ability to detect their
respective antigen by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. For immunofluorescence, normal (C5RO) and XPF
mutant (XP2YO) human fibroblasts were labeled with large (3 Am)
and small (0.6 Am) latex beads, respectively, and then cocultured on
glass coverslips to create a sample with an internal negative control
(XP2YO cells). The coverslips were simultaneously immunostained

Figure 2. Immunofluorescence detection of
ERCC1-XPF in cells. The cytoplasm of normal (C5RO) and
ERCC1-XPF–deficient XPF mutant (XP2YO) human
fibroblasts was labeled with large and small latex beads,
respectively. Cells were cocultured on glass coverslips,
fixed, and stained. A, bright-field images reveal
both cell types in a single field. Nuclei are stained with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI ). B, immunostaining
with antibody FL297 against ERCC1 distinguishes
between normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells. Nuclei of
C5RO, but not XP2YO, cells stain positively (red ; Alexa
Fluor 594). C, coimmunostaining with each of the test
antibodies (3F2, D-10, 4H4, and 8F1; secondary
antibody Alexa Fluor 488; green ) reveals those that are
specific for ERCC1-XPF. Only those nuclei that stain
positively with FL297 (red nuclei in B ) should show
green signal.

with two antibodies (Fig. 2): the test antibody against ERCC1 or
XPF and FL297, an antibody against ERCC1, which we previously
established specifically recognizes ERCC1-XPF–positive cells in
immunofluorescence (20). For the test antibody to be appropriate
for immunofluorescence application, it must stain the nuclei of
normal cells only (those with large beads) and the same nuclei as
FL297. Anti-XPF antibodies Ab-1, 4H4, and 3F2 and anti-ERCC1
antibody D-10 showed nuclear staining in normal cells (C5RO)
and no staining in XPF mutant cells (XP2YO). Antibody 8F1 stained
the nuclei of both cell types equally and therefore was unable
to distinguish between normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells
(Fig. 2, bottom; ref. 20). These data indicate that there are
several commercially available antibodies (ERCC1: FL297 and
D-10; XPF: Ab-1) appropriate for detecting ERCC1-XPF in human
cells. Potential applications include fine-needle aspirates and
tumor biopsies.
UV-C–induced local damage. When cells are irradiated with
UV-C through a polypropylene micropore filter, DNA damage is
induced in regions of the nucleus corresponding to the filter pores
(30). The sites of DNA damage can be identified with an antibody
against UV radiation–induced CPD (30). ERCC1-XPF localizes to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

these sites of damage during nucleotide excision repair and thus
colocalizes with CPD by immunofluorescence (30). Coimmunostaining of UV-C–irradiated fibroblasts with anti-CPD antibody and
test antibodies against ERCC1 or XPF revealed that the antibodies,
which discriminated between normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient
cells in immunofluorescence, also detected functional ERCC1-XPF
in this local damage assay (Fig. 3). Antibody 8F1, which was unable
to discriminate between normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells in
immunofluorescence, did not yield a signal that colocalized with
CPD (Fig. 3, bottom row). These results reinforce the immunofluorescence data and indicate that several commercially available
antibodies can be used to specifically detect ERCC1-XPF in
fixed cells.
Immunohistochemistry. The most commonly used approach
for measuring protein in tumors in clinical studies is immunohistochemistry. However, for many essential proteins that are of
interest as potential biomarkers in cancer prognosis, such as
ERCC1 and XPF, true negative controls are not available. To
circumvent this problem, we created paraffin-embedded blocks of
normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cell pellets for use as positive
and negative controls to screen the test antibodies for their

Validation of ERCC1-XPF Immunodetection

specificity in immunohistochemistry. Normal and XPF mutant
human fibroblasts were fixed in paraformaldehyde, pelleted in
agarose, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and immunostained
according to the method used for solid tumors. Antibody 3F2,
against XPF, stained the nuclei of paraffin-embedded normal but
not ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4,
row 1). Similarly, antibody 4H4 against XPF (Fig. 4, row 2) was able
to discriminate between normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells,
indicating that both of these antibodies are appropriate for detection of XPF by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Table S1).
In contrast, antibody 8F1 against ERCC1 stained the nuclei of
normal and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells equally (Fig. 4, row 3),
showing its inability to discriminate between ERCC1-positive and
ERCC1-negative specimens by immunohistochemistry as observed
previously for other applications (20). Like 8F1, the other test
antibodies were unable to discriminate between normal and
ERCC1-XPF–deficient cells by immunohistochemistry (data not
shown), with the exception of FL297. Antibody FL297 against
ERCC1 was tested on six cell lines: two ERCC1-XPF–proficient
(C5RO and HeLa) and four ERCC1-XPF–deficient (XP2YO, XP42RO,
XP51RO, and 165TOR). FL297 stained nuclei of both repairproficient cell lines (Fig. 5, C5RO and HeLa). All ERCC1-XPF–
deficient cells (Fig. 5, XP2YO, XP42RO, XP51RO, and 165TOR) did
not have nuclear staining, although there was a variable level of
cytoplasmic staining in all cell lines. ERCC1-XPF functions
exclusively as a nuclear complex. Thus, the absence of nuclear
staining indicates a negative result on immunohistochemistry as

expected for these ERCC1-XPF–deficient cell lines. HeLa cells
showed a more intense nuclear staining than C5RO cells. This
correlates with the relative expression of ERCC1 in these cell lines,
indicating that FL297 can distinguish between different levels of
ERCC1 on immunohistochemistry. Therefore, FL297 (anti-ERCC1),
4H4 (anti-XPF), and 3F2 (anti-XPF) are the only antibodies against
ERCC1-XPF shown to specifically detect this DNA repair nuclease
by immunohistochemistry.
Lung tumor sections stained with antibody 3F2 display highly
variable nuclear staining in different NSCLC samples (Fig. 6A),
suggesting that expression of XPF may vary in tumors. Sections
from the same NSCLC tumor were immunostained with FL297
(anti-ERCC1) and 3F2 (anti-XPF) to determine if both proteins are
detected in the same cells as expected (Fig. 6B). Both antibodies
stained the same cell types with approximately the same intensity,
confirming that ERCC1-XPF are coexpressed and both FL297 and
3F2 antibodies are appropriate for immunodetection of this repair
complex in clinical specimens.

Discussion
For several types of common cancers (e.g., lung cancer), patient
survival rates have not improved in the last decade (33). Response
to therapy is highly variable and, in some cases (e.g., ovarian
cancer), does not improve overall survival (33–35). This is
particularly true for platinum-based therapies to which patients
frequently become refractory (36). Therefore, a major goal in

of ERCC1-XPF at sites of UV-C–induced
DNA damage. C5RO fibroblasts were
irradiated with UV-C through a filter to
induce subnuclear domains of DNA
damage. Cells were stained with (A )
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI ) to
identify the nuclei, (B ) anti-CPD to identify
the sites of DNA damage, and (C ) each of
the test antibodies against ERCC1 or XPF.
The merged images (D ) reveal which
antibodies give a signal that colocalizes
with UV-induced DNA damage, indicating
their specificity for ERCC1-XPF DNA repair
endonuclease.

Figure 4. Immunohistochemical detection of ERCC1-XPF. Normal or
ERCC1-XPF–deficient human fibroblasts (XP2YO) were fixed in
paraformaldehyde, pelleted in agarose, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and

oncology is to define biomarkers that can stratify cancer patients
according to their likelihood of responding to chemotherapy. A
highly active current focus of this effort is to measure expression of
ERCC1 in tumors as a potential biomarker of DNA repair and
therefore resistance to genotoxic therapeutic agents (37–39). To
infer conclusions about the mechanism of therapy failure, it is
imperative to rigorously standardize methods to accurately
measure biomarker expression.
Immunohistochemistry is an extremely valuable method for
measuring tumor biomarkers. Unlike other immunologic methods,
immunohistochemistry is applied to fixed specimens, which are the
most abundantly available from surgical resections of tumors,
allowing the large-scale screens necessary to validate the biological
significance of novel biomarkers. Small amounts of tumor tissue,
such as those obtained by needle biopsy, are sufficient for a
semiquantitative measurement of the antigen of interest. Immunohistochemistry is therefore used in decisions regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of malignancies. However, there are
multiple variables in the processing of samples in immunohistochemistry and data analysis that need to be addressed before the
widespread use of immunohistochemistry as a quantitative
immunoassay (40). The staining intensity is affected significantly
by the choice of fixative, time of fixation (41), extent of
deparaffinization (42), thickness of the tissue section (41), antigen
retrieval technique (43), sensitivity and specificity of antibodies,
and interobserver inconsistencies in sample analysis (40). Furthermore, scoring of samples as positive or negative for a particular
biomarker can be based on a subjective scale of staining intensity
or percent of positively staining cells. Therefore, the importance of
validating and standardizing every immunohistochemical protocol

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

used in clinical trials cannot be overstated. In this article, we have
critically analyzed the reagents available for measuring ERCC1
expression in tissue samples and developed a standardized method
for ERCC1 immunohistochemistry that could be applied to tumors.
To develop an immunohistochemical protocol, the first step is to
identify an antibody that is specific for the target antigen. This is
accomplished by immunoblotting using protein extracts from
human cells or tissue and showing that the antibody detects a
single band of the appropriate molecular weight (44, 45). It is
imperative to include positive and negative controls in which the
antigen is known to be expressed or depleted (either genetically or
by short hairpin RNA), respectively (Fig. 1). Another excellent
positive control is recombinant His-tagged protein included as a
molecular weight control on immunoblot or overexpressed in a cell
line (Fig. 1). Of 11 screened antibodies that detect ERCC1-XPF, 10
were specific for the repair complex (Supplementary Table S1).
The second step in developing an immunohistochemical
protocol is to validate that an antibody retains its specificity for
an antigen in fixed samples (44). This can be accomplished directly
in tissue samples only if negative controls (tissues in which the
antigen is not expressed) are available. For many of the tumor
biomarkers, this is not feasible because the antigens of interest are
key regulators of cell cycle control and genome maintenance and
thus are ubiquitously expressed. Alternatively, the specificity of an
antibody to detect a biomarker in fixed material can be validated
using positive and negative control cell lines processed according
to the immunohistochemical protocol (Fig. 4; refs. 44, 46). In our
experiments, normal human fibroblasts (C5RO) were used as a
positive control and XP-F patient fibroblasts (XP2YO), deficient in
ERCC1-XPF, were used as a negative control due to the absence of
human tissue samples missing this protein (Fig. 4). Such internal
controls must be included in every immunohistochemical analysis
(41, 45, 47). One important step in validating proper controls is

Figure 5. Immunohistochemical detection of ERCC1 by antibody FL297.
Six human cell lines were paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained with
FL297. Two were ERCC1-XPF–proficient (C5RO and HeLa) and four were
ERCC1-XPF–deficient (XP2YO, XP42RO, XP51RO, and 165TOR).

Validation of ERCC1-XPF Immunodetection

nonspecific antigen (Fig. 1D) and are thus inappropriate for use as
either positive or negative control for validating this antibody. In
the present work, using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal
and ERCC1-XPF–deficient cell lines, it was confirmed that 8F1 is
unable to differentiate between normal and ERCC1-deficient
cells by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4). Because antibody 8F1 is
the most widely used antibody for immunohistochemistry (16–18,
48–50), it is important to emphasize that it is not specific for
ERCC1 and that validated alternative antibodies exist to reliably
measure ERCC1 by immunohistochemistry. The extensive literature on 8F1 immunohistochemistry does, however, indicate that
the antibody may have prognostic value. This warrants further
investigation to identify the unknown antigen recognized by 8F1.
After testing a panel of antibodies raised against ERCC1 and XPF,
antibodies suitable for a variety of immunodetection techniques
were identified (Supplementary Table S1). Most of these are
unsuitable for immunohistochemistry primarily because they do
not discriminate between positive and negative controls in fixed
material. Those that do work (FL297, 4H4, and 3F2) should
facilitate the intense interest in measuring ERCC1 expression in
tumor samples by immunohistochemistry. These are validated
alternatives to 8F1 that can be used to reliably measure ERCC1 and
XPF by immunohistochemistry. FL297 and 3F2 were used to
measure ERCC1 and XPF, respectively, in lung tumor sections
(Fig. 6). Variable levels of cytoplasmic staining were seen in paraffinembedded cell lines (Fig. 5). This staining does not correlate with
the level of ERCC1-XPF in cells nor with their sensitivity to
genotoxic stress. It should therefore be noted that, when using these
antibodies, grading of expression levels should be based on the
extent of nuclear staining only. The levels of both proteins
vary between specimens, ranging from intense staining to virtually
no staining, but parallel one another (Fig. 6). This indicates
that either ERCC1 or XPF might serve as a biomarker of DNA repair
in tumors. There was also differential expression within a tumor
depending on the cell type. These results indicate that measuring
ERCC1-XPF may be of value for stratifying patients for responsiveness to therapy.

A, lung tumor sections were immunostained with 3F2. Representative sections
have been arranged in increasing order of staining intensity (i-vi ) showing
the range of staining variability. B, cross-sections of the same tumor stained

staining patterns.

establishing that the antigen staining has a proper subcellular
localization; for example, ERCC1-XPF is a nuclear antigen (Fig. 2).
A second step that can provide internal validation of an
immunostaining protocol is to differentially label the positive
and negative control cell lines and coculture them, creating a
sample with both immunoreactive and unreactive cells (Fig. 2).
Using the above methods with stringent controls, we discovered
that antibody 8F1 is not suitable for measurement of ERCC1
expression because it detects a second antigen (20). It has been
reported that 8F1 could discriminate between HeLa cells and an
isogenic strain in which ERCC1 expression was knocked down by
small interfering RNA (32). Based on this, it was argued that 8F1 is
suitable for measurement of ERCC1 by immunohistochemistry.
However, HeLa cells do not have appreciable amount of the
