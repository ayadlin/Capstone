Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cks1 and Cks2 are adaptor-like proteins that bind many cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). A
wealth of clinical data has shown that Cks proteins are overexpressed in many types of human
cancers and this often correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness. Previously, we showed that
Cks overexpression abrogates the intra-S phase checkpoint, a major barrier to oncogene-mediated
transformation. Interestingly, the intra-S phase checkpoint is crucial for the cellular response to
replication stress, a major pathway of apoptosis induction by many chemotherapeutic agents.
Here, we demonstrate cancer cells that overexpress Cks1 or Cks2 override the intra-S phase
checkpoint in the presence of replication stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-Fluorourocil
(5-FU) and methotrexate (MTX) leading to enhanced sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
enforced expression of Cks1 in a MTX-resistant breast cancer cell line was found to restore drug
sensitivity. Our results suggest that Cks proteins are important determinants of apoptosis induction
of replication stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-FU.

are not fully understood, studies in yeast and Xenopus suggest they likely act as adaptors in
mediating Cdk functions, such as by targeting cyclin-Cdk complexes to their respective
substrates or promoting their interaction with other cell division regulatory proteins (1–7). In
Saccharomyces cerevisae, Cks proteins have also been shown to play a role in general
transcription regulation by controlling nucleosome density in a process that is both Cdk1 and
19S proteosome-dependent (8, 9).

Humans express two closely related Cks paralogs (designated Cks1 and Cks2) that are
highly similar at the structural level (81% amino acid identity). Knockout studies in mice
have demonstrated that Cks proteins perform both essential redundant and specialized
functions in cell division control and development. Cks2 is essential for the early stages of
meiosis, with CKS2−/− knockout male and female mice arresting germ cell development in
metaphase of the first meiotic division (10). Cks1 has been shown to perform a specialized
Cdk-independent function as a cofactor of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates the
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of Cdk inhibitors p27, p21, and Rb family protein p130,
among others (11–13). Targeted disruption of both CKS1 and CKS2 results in embryonic
lethality with development arrested at or before the morula stage after only two to four cell
divisions (14). This essential redundant function in mammalian development has been
linked to impaired transcription of genes that encode mitotic regulators cyclin A, cyclin B1,
and Cdk1, resulting in cell cycle arrest in G2 phase.

A wealth of clinical studies has shown that Cks proteins likely play important causative
roles in human tumorigenesis. Overexpression of Cks1 has been reported in cancers of the
breast, colon, lung, stomach, bladder, kidney, mouth, esophagus, and ovary, and this
phenotype is often associated with down-regulation of SCFSkp2 target protein p27 and
increased tumor aggressiveness (15–25). Cks1 has also been shown to be transcriptionally
activated by oncoproteins c-Myc, B-Raf, and cyclin D1 (26–27). Overexpression of Cks2
has been observed in cancers of the breast, colon, bladder, esophagus, stomach, brain, and
bile duct, and is often associated with an increased risk of metastasis and tumor recurrence
(15, 28–37).

Previously, we showed that overexpression of Cks proteins abrogates the intra-S phase
checkpoint induced by replication stress, potentially alleviating a critical barrier of
oncoprotein-mediated transformation (38). Interestingly, several widely used chemotherapy
drugs promote apoptosis of cancer cells by creating nucleotide pool imbalances or forming
crosslinks in DNA which induce DNA damage and replication stress. We therefore sought
to determine whether Cks overexpression could possibly influence the efficacy of this class
of anti-cancer drugs. Here, we show Cks overexpressing cancer cells override DNA damage
checkpoints when treated with replication stress-inducing chemotherapies, leading to
enhanced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

overexpression) suggesting these cells could be particularly vulnerable to chemotherapies
that function, at least in part, through this mode of action. To test this, we generated MCF-7
breast cancer cells that stably overexpressed Cks1 at levels comparable to high-expressing
breast cancer specimens and evaluated their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs known to
induce replication stress, such as 5-FU and MTX. 5-FU is converted to several active
metabolites in cells, including fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP),
fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP), and fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), the
former of which functions as an irreversible inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS). TS
inhibition promotes an imbalance in nucleotide pools favoring the synthesis of deoxyuridine
triphosphate (dUTP) over deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and replication stress. MTX
is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) which is involved in thymidylate (dTMP)
production. 5-FU or MTX treatment of stable Cks1 overexpressing MCF-7 cells was found
to increase the levels of apoptotic markers such as Parp, Puma, and Caspase 7, compared to
control cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we observed a dose-dependent effect of Cks1
expression on MCF-7 growth inhibition in the presence of 5-FU, but not in cells treated with
the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. 1). To ensure these results were not due
to cell line differences and could also be extended to the paralog Cks2, we generated Cks1
or Cks2 overexpressing MCF-7 cell populations by lentiviral transduction and evaluated
their sensitivity to 5-FU. Treatment of the transduced cells with 5-FU showed
overexpression of Cks1 or Cks2 induced a significant increase in apoptosis, as evidenced by
increased cleaved Parp and caspase 9, compared to control (empty vector) cells (Fig. 1B). In
addition, Cks1 and Cks2 overexpressing MCF-7 cells displayed a significantly reduced
growth rate in the presence of 5-FU (p<0.01) (Fig. 1C). Microscopic analysis of the 5-FU
treated cells showed increased pyknosis, an irreversible condensation of chromatin
associated with apoptosis, in the Cks1 and Cks2 overexpressing cells compared to control
cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover, clonogenic assays revealed a significantly reduced ability of Cks1
or Cks2 overexpressing cells to form colonies in the presence of 5-FU (p<0.0001 and
p<0.01, respectively) (Fig. 1E), consistent with increased cell death induction. Extensive
attempts to confirm these results using a reverse experimental strategy in which Cks1/2
expression was knocked down in Cks1/2 overexpressing cancer cells were unsuccessful,
since knockdown of both genes was found to induce significant apoptosis that dwarfed drug
treatment in all cell lines tested, possibly indicating the cells are addicted to Cks1/2
overexpression for their survival (data not shown). However, knockdown of Cks1 in low
Cks1/2 expressing MCF-7 cells was found to abrogate Puma expression following 5-FU
treatment (data not shown). Collectively these results showed that overexpression of Cks1 or
Cks2 conferred sensitivity to replication stress-inducing chemotherapy drugs such as 5-FU
and MTX.

5-FU treatment promotes an increase in the dUMP/dTMP ratio leading to polymerasecatalyzed incorporation of uracil and 5-FU derivative 5-F-dUMP into genomic DNA. Uracil

fragmentation, thus triggering the DNA damage response. To attempt to explain the
enhanced apoptosis observed in Cks 1/2 overexpressing cells treated with 5-FU, we first

evaluated whether Cks1 overexpression might affect the rate of incorporation of 5-FU
derivatives into genomic DNA. Stable Cks1 overexpressing and control MCF-7 cells were
treated with 2-14C-labeled 5-FU for 48 hrs and incorporation of 2-14C-F-dUMP into
genomic DNA quantified by scintillation counting. A 40% increase in 2-14C-F-dUMP
incorporation per μg of genomic DNA was observed in Cks1 overexpressing cells compared
to control cells (p< 0.001) (Fig. 2A). We next analyzed the DNA damage response in these
cells following treatment with 5-FU. Cks1 overexpressing cells were found to contain
increased phospho-Ser15-p53 and phospho-Ser1981-ATM, markers of the DNA damage
response, compared to control cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting more robust DNA damage.
Moreover, knockdown of ATM expression by siRNA in the Cks1 overexpressing cells
reduced the expression of apoptotic markers cleaved Parp and caspase 7, indicating the
apoptosis induced was a direct result of enhanced genotoxic stress (Supplementary Fig. 2).
A similar enhancement of the DNA damage response was observed in HCT116 colorectal
cancer cells engineered to stably overexpress Cks1, demonstrating the effect was not breast
cancer cell specific (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results suggested that Cks1
overexpression enhances the apoptotic effects of 5-FU through genotoxic stress, possibly by
increasing the incorporation of 5-FU derivative 5-F-dUMP into genomic DNA.

Previously, we showed that the ability of Cks proteins to override of the intra-S phase
checkpoint was dependent on the interaction with Cdks (38). Since Cdk-independent
functions have been reported for Cks proteins (described above) we next sought to
determine whether the 5-FU sensitivity of Cks1 overexpressing cells was Cdk binding
dependent. MCF-7 cells were transiently transduced with adenoviruses that expressed
control (β-gal), Cks1, or Cks1E63Q, a mutant that cannot bind Cdks (39). Treatment of these
transduced cell populations with 5-FU revealed enhanced DNA damage response and
increased apoptosis only in the cells that expressed wild-type Cks1 (Fig. 2C). The reduced
apoptosis observed in this experiment compared to previous experiments (i.e. Figs. 1A, 1B,
and 2B) was likely due to lower exogenous Cks1 expression compared to the endogenous
protein. These results demonstrated the 5-FU sensitivity phenotype is mediated through a
direct interaction of Cks proteins with Cdks.
Override of the intra-S-phase checkpoint in Cks1 overexpressing cells is required for 5-FU
sensitivity

Author Manuscript

The increased incorporation of 5-FU derivatives into genomic DNA of Cks1 overexpressing
cells (Fig. 2A) suggested that the enhanced apoptosis could be due to an override of the
intra-S-phase checkpoint, as we previously reported for replication stress induced by
oncogene expression (38). To test this, we first analyzed molecular markers of the cell cycle
in Cks1 and Cks2 overexpressing MCF-7 cell populations treated with 5-FU. 5-FU treatment
is known to invoke a G1/S phase or intra-S-phase checkpoint arrest of cell division.
However, we observed increased levels of cyclin B1, a marker of late S, G2, and M phases,
in MCF-7 cells that overexpressed either Cks1 or Cks2 (Fig. 3A). We then evaluated the
effects on cell cycle kinetics by flow cytometry. In contrast to control cells which showed
arrest mainly in G1 and S phases, a significant proportion of Cks1 overexpressing MCF-7
cells had progressed into S phase 24 hrs after 5-FU treatment, as indicated by a broadening
of the G1 peak shoulder as well as an increase in the S phase population (total S phase cells:

39.4%-control vs. 56.9% for Cks1-overexpressing cells) (Fig. 3B). A similar effect on cell
cycle kinetics was observed previously for Cks overexpressing cells treated with HU (38).
These results confirmed that Cks1 overexpressing cells failed to arrest cell cycle progression
and continued to replicate their DNA in the presence of 5-FU. To evaluate the significance
of the failure to arrest cell cycle on the enhanced apoptosis of 5-FU treated Cks
overexpressing cells, we arrested cell cycle progression in late G1 phase by incubation with
mimosine prior to 5-FU treatment. Mimosine has been shown to arrest cell cycle progression
prior to the establishment of DNA replication forks (40). Mimosine treatment of Cks1
overexpressing cells was found to abrogate the enhanced apoptosis induced by 5-FU
treatment (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that Cks overexpression promotes sensitivity to 5FU by overriding DNA damage checkpoints.

Cks-overexpression re-sensitizes chemotherapy resistant cells and promotes improved
chemotherapy response in vivo

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the potential clinical significance of Cks proteins in the chemotherapy response,
we explored whether Cks overexpression could overcome resistance developed to
replication stress-inducing chemotherapies. MTX-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells were engineered to overexpress Cks1 at a level similar to overexpressing breast
cancers, treated with MTX or vehicle, and apoptosis induction analyzed by Annexin V
staining and Western blotting. Cks1 overexpressing cells displayed a >2-fold increase in
Annexin V positive cells and increased cleaved Parp compared to control cells, suggesting
re-sensitization to MTX treatment (Figs. 4A & B). We next employed an orthotopic breast
cancer model to determine whether the chemotherapy sensitivity phenotype could be
extended to cancers in vivo. Stable Cks1 overexpressing and control MCF-7 cells were
implanted into the mammary fat pads of nude mice and 5-FU administered after the tumor
volumes reached 100 mm3. A significant reduction in tumor growth was observed for the
Cks1 overexpressing tumors indicating they were indeed sensitized to 5-FU treatment
(p<0.05) (Fig. 4C). Molecular analysis of the resultant tumors showed increased cleaved
Parp and Puma expression in the Cks1 overexpressing tumors compared to control tumors
(Fig. 4D). Quantification of the Western blot signals demonstrated a significant increase in
cleaved Parp in Cks1 overexpressing breast cancers treated with 5-FU (p<0.01). These
results confirmed in vivo that Cks overexpression is a clinically important determinant of the
response of breast cancers to replication stress-inducing chemotherapies.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Our results demonstrate that Cks1/2 overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to replication
stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-FU and MTX by overriding DNA damage
checkpoints, including the replication stress checkpoint (also known as the intra-S phase
checkpoint). 5-FU has been shown to induce replication stress by promoting
misincorporations of its derivatives (dUMP and FdUMP) into genomic DNA resulting in the
accumulation of DNA repair intermediates and fragmentation, and inhibiting TS leading to
imbalances in nucleotide pools. Both of these mechanisms activate the intra-S phase
checkpoint mediated by ATR-Chk1 signaling, which in turn functions to down-regulate Cdk
activity through targeted degradation of the Cdk activating phosphatase Cdc25A (41). We

previously showed that Cks overexpression overrides the intra-S phase checkpoint induced
by HU treatment or oncogene expression (38). Therefore, 5-FU sensitivity of Cks
overexpressing cancer cells is likely caused, at least in part, by the failure of cells to invoke
G1 and intra-S phase checkpoints in response to replication stress, leading to enhanced
induction of apoptosis through DNA damage overload. This hypothesis is supported by our
data which showed treatment of Cks overexpressing cells with 5-FU results in a higher
proportion of cells entering S phase, increased incorporation of 5-FU intermediates, and
enhanced activation of ATM-checkpoint signaling.

Author Manuscript

Overexpression of either Cks1 or Cks2 was found to sensitize cancer cells to 5-FU
treatment, suggesting this phenotype is mediated through a redundant function of Cks
proteins. Previously we showed that Cks overexpression can partially restore Cdk2associated kinase activity even in the presence of inhibitory (Tyr15) phosphorylations (38).
Although the precise molecular mechanism(s) for this is unclear Cks proteins have been
proposed to function in Cdk substrate targeting likely mediated through their anion binding
site, which can bind phosphate (7, 39). Therefore, high level expression of Cks proteins
could override the intra-S phase checkpoint invoked by 5-FU treatment by enhancing the
targeting of Cdk2 substrates that promote continued cell cycle progression in the presence of
replication stress. Further research is needed to identify these Cdk substrates and determine
their essentiality in overriding the intra-S phase checkpoint.

The molecular cause(s) of Cks1 and Cks2 overexpression in human cancers are not well
defined. Cks1 has been shown to be a transcriptional target of oncoproteins c-Myc, B-RAF,
and cyclin D1 (26–27), which are frequently overexpressed in many types of human cancers.
In addition, the CKS1 locus is localized to chromosome region 1q21 which is frequently
amplified in cancers, including those of the breast (42). However, information regarding the
mechanism of Cks2 overexpression is lacking. It will be of interest to determine the
predominant causes of Cks overexpressions in human cancers and whether specific
oncoproteins might play prominent roles in promoting Cks-dependent chemotherapy
sensitivity.

Author Manuscript

Cks proteins could have therapeutic implications as both clinical biomarkers and molecular
targets for enhancing chemotherapeutic efficacy. 5-FU is routinely used to treat breast as
well as head and neck cancers, and is a main chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal
cancers. Given the results of our study, assessment of Cks1/2 levels in clinical specimens is
warranted, with the potential to provide a new biomarker for response to 5-FU and possibly
other drugs that function through replication stress. Moreover, Cks1 has been shown to be
targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (43). Therefore, drugs
that effectively block this process in cancers might be useful to enhance the efficacy of
replication stress-inducing chemotherapies, or possibly restore sensitivity to cancers that
have developed resistance to these drugs. Additional research is also needed to determine
whether the therapeutic benefits of Cks overexpression might extend to other
chemotherapies that induce DNA damage and replication stress through alternative
mechanisms, such as formation of DNA crosslinks (e.g. Cisplatin), topoisomerase inhibition
(e.g. Irinotecan), or prevention of DNA replication elongation (e.g. gemcitabine).
Furthermore, it was recently shown that 5-FU misincorporated bases in DNA are excised by

thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), and TDG overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to 5-FU
treatment (44). Therefore, it will be of interest to determine if Cks overexpression can
synergize with TDG to enhance the efficacy of 5-FU and other replication stress-inducing
drugs for cancer treatment.

Apoptosis assays

Author Manuscript

Pyknosis was quantified by treating cells seeded on glass cover slips with 5-FU for 48 hrs
followed by incubation with fresh medium for 72 hrs. Cells were fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde and stained with DAPI. Cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope
and the percentage of cells with apoptotic bodies, pyknotic and fragmented nuclei,
calculated. At least 150 cells were counted for each experiment. Clonogenic assays were
performed by treating cells with vehicle (DMSO) or 2.5–5 μM 5-FU for 48 hrs post-plating
onto 10cm dishes. After 21 days in fresh medium, the colonies were fixed with cold
methanol and stained with crystal violet stain (Sigma). Annexin V analyses were performed
using the FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences). Cells were co-stained with
propidium iodide and analyzed using a FACScan Flow Cytometer. Cell cycle kinetics was
analyzed using CellQuest software.

Figure 1. Cks1/2 overexpression sensitizes breast cancer cells to replication stress-inducing
chemotherapies

Author Manuscript

(a) Increased apoptotic markers cleaved Parp, Puma, and cleaved caspase 7 in stable Cks1
overexpressing MCF-7 cells treated with 5-FU or MTX for the indicated times. Figure
below shows Flag-Cks1 expression relative to endogenous Cks1/2 protein level. An
antibody that detects both Cks1 and Cks2 was used. (b) Enhanced apoptosis markers
cleaved Parp and cleaved caspase 9 in MCF-7 cell populations transduced with Cks1 or
Cks2 expressing lentiviruses and treated with 5-FU for 24 hrs. Asterisk indicates
background band detected with the anti-cleaved caspase 9 antibody. (c) Growth suppression
of Cks1 and Cks2 overexpressing MCF-7 cell populations treated with 5-FU for 48 hrs
(p<0.01 for both). Cells were counted 72 hrs post-treatment. (d) Increased pyknosis in Cks1
and Cks2 overexpressing MCF-7 cell populations treated with 5-FU for 24 hrs. (e)
Decreased colony formation of Cks1 and Cks2 overexpressing MCF-7 cell populations
treated with 2.5 or 5 μM 5-FU for 72 hrs (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively). Colonies
were stained 21 days post-plating.

Figure 2. Enhanced 5-FU sensitivity of Cks1 overexpressing cells is associated with increased 5FU incorporation and DNA damage response, and is dependent on Cdk binding

Author Manuscript

(a) Increased incorporation of 2-14C-5-FU derivatives into the genomic DNA of stable Cks1
overexpressing MCF-7 cells compared to control cells (p< 0.001). (b) Increased DNA
damage markers phospho-Ser1981-ATM and phospho-Ser15-p53 in stable Cks1
overexpressing MCF-7 cells treated with 5-FU for the indicated times. Western blot below
shows expression of Flag-Cks1 relative to endogenous Cks proteins. (c) Cks1 sensitivity to
5-FU is dependent on Cks1 binding Cdks. MCF-7 cells were transiently transduced with
adenoviruses that express control (β-gal), Cks1, or Cks1E63Q, a mutant defective in Cdkbinding. Cells were then treated with 5-FU for 48 hrs and apoptosis markers analyzed by
Western blotting. Cdk2 is shown as a loading control.

Figure 3. Cks1 overexpressing cells fail to arrest cell cycle progression in response to 5-FU

Author Manuscript

(a) Western blot analysis showing late S/G2/M phase marker cyclin B1 in Cks1 and Cks2
overexpressing MCF-7 cell populations treated with 5-FU for 48 hrs. Cks blot used an antiCks1 antibody that favors detection of Cks1 over Cks2. Ku86 is shown as loading control.
(b) Flow cytometry analysis demonstrating progression into S phase for stable Cks1
overexpressing MCF-7 cells treated with 5-FU for 24 hrs. S phase cells (which include the
shoulder of the G1 peak) are shaded in black. (c) Arrest of Cks1 overexpressing MCF-7 cells
in late G1 phase abrogates 5-FU sensitivity. Stable Cks1 overexpressing cells were incubated
with mimosine for 16 hrs prior to treatment with 5-FU for 24 hrs and apoptosis marker
cleaved Parp analyzed by Western blotting.

Figure 4. Cks overexpression can re-sensitize MTX-resistant cancer cells and promotes favorable
response to 5-FU in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model

Author Manuscript

(a) Cks1 overexpression in MTX-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells re-sensitizes them to MTX
treatment. Flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V staining vs. DNA content (PI staining).
Early apoptotic cells (lower right quadrant) and late-stage apoptotic cells (upper right
quadrant) are indicated. (b) Quantification of apoptotic cells in A. (c) Cks1 overexpression
sensitizes breast cancers to 5-FU treatment in vivo. Nude mice were implanted with control
(T1-6) or stable Cks1 overexpressing (T7-12) MCF-7 cells into their mammary fat pads and
treated with 5-FU after tumor volume reached 100 mm3. (d) Western blot analysis of
apoptosis markers cleaved Parp and Puma of resultant breast tumors described in C.
Quantifications of cleaved Parp were normalized to actin for statistical comparisons.
