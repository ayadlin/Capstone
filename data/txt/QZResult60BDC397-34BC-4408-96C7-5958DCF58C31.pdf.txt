Preface

HHMI Author Manuscript

Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity arise among cancer cells within the same tumor as a
consequence of genetic change, environmental differences, and reversible changes in cellular
properties. Some cancers also contain a hierarchy in which tumorigenic cancer stem cells
differentiate into non-tumorigenic progeny. However, it remains unclear what fraction of cancers
follow the stem cell model and what clinical behaviors the model explains. In this review we will
evaluate the implications of recent lineage tracing and deep-sequencing studies for the cancer stem
cell model and the extent to which it accounts for therapy resistance and disease progression.

Introduction
The cancer stem cell model provides one explanation for the phenotypic and functional
heterogeneity among cancer cells in some tumors1–5. The model posits that some cancers are
hierarchically organized into subpopulations of tumorigenic cancer stem cells and their nontumorigenic progeny. In these cases, cancer stem cells are thought to drive tumor growth
and disease progression, perhaps including therapy resistance6–8 and metastasis9,10.
However, difficulty replicating solid cancer stem cell markers, variability from patient to
patient, and variation in results from different xenograft models have meant that it remains
unclear what fraction of cancers follow this model – most, or only a minority11?

HHMI Author Manuscript

Even in cancers that clearly contain a hierarchy of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells,
this hierarchy must co-exist with other sources of heterogeneity including clonal
evolution12, heterogeneity in the microenvironment 13,14, and reversible changes in cancer
cell properties that can occur independently of hierarchical organization15–18. Under these
circumstances it is not necessarily clear which phenotypic and functional differences among
cells arise from which sources of heterogeneity. To what extent do metastasis, therapy
resistance, and disease progression reflect intrinsic properties of cancer stem cells as
opposed to genetic evolution or other sources of heterogeneity? Integration of results from
multiple experimental approaches will be necessary to distinguish the relative contributions
of these sources of heterogeneity to disease progression.
New experimental approaches have provided perspective and insight into these questions.

have provided evidence in support of the cancer stem cell model in some contexts and
evidence against the model in other contexts19–23. Since transplantation assays evaluate the
potential of cancer cells to form tumors, rather than their actual fate in the native tumor,
fate-mapping complements what we have learned from transplantation assays (Figure 1).
High-coverage sequencing of human tumors has also provided new insights into genetic
heterogeneity within tumors and the cells responsible for relapse after therapy24–28. In this
review, we will evaluate the implications of these new data for the cancer stem cell model
and the extent to which this model accounts for clinically important forms of heterogeneity
in cancer.

Testing tumorigenic potential

HHMI Author Manuscript

The central idea in the cancer stem cell model is that tumor growth and disease progression
are driven by minority populations of tumorigenic cells, and that many other cancer cells
have little or no capacity to contribute to tumor growth. This means that therapeutic
strategies should particularly focus on killing the tumorigenic cells. Experimentally, the
cancer stem cell model has primarily been tested using transplantation assays, which test the
potential of a cancer cell to form a tumor. These assays have demonstrated the existence of
phenotypically distinct subpopulations of tumorigenic/leukemogenic and non-tumorigenic/
non-leukemogenic cells in a number of human cancers including acute myeloid leukemia
(AML)29,30, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)31, breast cancer32, glioblastoma 6,33,
colorectal cancer 34–36, pancreatic cancer 37, and ovarian cancer 38–40. Operationally, the
cells that formed tumors in these studies were rare. Nonetheless, in principle a cancer could
have common tumorigenic cells and still be hierarchically organized consistent with the
cancer stem cell model41.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Tumorigenic potential can only be tested in a permissive environment. A persistent concern
is that there may be cancer cells that have the potential to contribute to tumor growth and
disease progression in patients but that do not have the opportunity to exhibit this potential
after transplantation. There are many reasons why a transplantation assay might
underestimate the frequency of cancer cells with tumorigenic potential. Human cells must be
transplanted into highly immunocompromised mice to escape the powerful xenogeneic
immune response that kills human cells in mice. Although a succession of increasingly
immunocompromised mice has been used to assay the tumorigenic potential of human
cancer cells, from nude, to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID), to non-obese diabetic
SCID (NOD/SCID), to NOD/SCID IL2Rγnull mice (NSG), all of these mice retain some
xenogeneic immune barrier 42. There is no opportunity to test whether human cells have
tumorigenic potential if they are killed by a xenogeneic immune response. The frequencies
of human AML cells30,43, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells44,45, melanoma cells46,
and lung cancer cells47 with leukemogenic or tumorigenic activity are much higher in more
highly immunocompromised mice.
Other mechanisms also contribute to an underestimation of tumorigenic potential. Many
mouse malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells have tumorigenic potential,
but cells of one genotype depend upon exogenous laminin to form tumors while cells of
another genotype express laminin cell-autonomously48. This raises the arresting possibility

that tumors from different patients may require different assay conditions to read out their
full spectrum of tumorigenic cells. There are other cases in which key adhesion molecules or
growth factors are required for cells to exhibit clonogenic activity but are not available to
human cells in mouse tissues because of the inability of mouse ligands to bind human
receptors49. Xenotransplanted tumors can also lack the architecture and stroma of tumors
growing in native sites50. There may be many variables that influence the permissiveness of
the environment for tumorigenesis, including uncharacterized factors that have not yet been
taken into account in assays.
Given these concerns about xenotransplantation it is reassuring that syngeneic
transplantation of mouse cancers has also supported the cancer stem cell model. Studies of
cells from mouse germ lineage cancers 51, AML52,53, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(CMML)8, CML54, breast cancer55,56, and medulloblastoma57,58 have all been consistent
with the cancer stem cell model. Many of these studies demonstrated that some fractions of
cancer cells are enriched for tumorigenic activity even when there is no xenogeneic barrier
to engraftment. The cancer stem cell model cannot, therefore, be entirely an artifact of
xenotransplantation.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Improved transplantation assay conditions have revealed that some cancers have common
leukemogenic/tumorigenic cells (some AMLs59, many melanomas15,46,60, some
ALLs59,61,62, and mouse MPNSTs48), while other cancers continue to have only rare
leukemogenic/tumorigenic cells no matter what assay conditions are used31,41,47. More
work will be required to determine what fraction of cancers falls in each category.

HHMI Author Manuscript

For all of the reasons described above, it will be critical to continue to optimize
transplantation assays to most accurately estimate the spectrum of cancer cells that retain the
potential to contribute to tumor growth. This will require systematically testing variations in
xenotransplantation assay conditions, including the addition of human cytokines 63 or other
variables that might influence human cell engraftment64. Many human cancers continue to
be transplanted into heterotopic sites in mice without a careful comparison of the
consequences of heterotopic versus orthotopic engraftment. It will not be surprising if we
are continuing to vastly underestimate the frequency of cells that can contribute to disease
progression in some human cancers despite the advances made in xenotransplantation assays
over the past several years.

Testing hierarchical organization
Beyond showing a cancer has tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells, the other criterion that
must be satisfied according to the cancer stem cell model is that the tumorigenic cells give
rise to the non-tumorigenic progeny. Without demonstrating a lineage relationship, the
functional differences between cells may reflect genetic differences. Tumorigenic human
cancer cells from AML 29,30, CML 31, breast cancer 32, glioblastoma 6,33, colorectal
cancer 34–36, pancreatic cancer 37, and ovarian cancer 38–40 formed more tumorigenic cells
as well as phenotypically distinct non-tumorigenic cells in immunocompromised mice. For
example, CD34+CD38− AML cells from many patients are not only enriched for
leukemogenic activity but also form CD34− and CD38+ non-leukemogenic cells upon

transplantation65. Similar observations were made in mouse models of germ lineage
cancers51, AML52,53, CMML8, CML54, breast cancer55,56, and medulloblastoma57. This is
the basis for the idea that cancer stem cells form heterogeneous tumors by undergoing
epigenetic changes akin to the differentiation of normal stem cells.

HHMI Author Manuscript

There are also cancers for which there is compelling evidence against the stem cell model.
Tumorigenic cells are common and phenotypically diverse in stage III and IV human
melanomas15,46. Nonetheless, Boiko et al.66 suggested that only CD271+ melanoma cells
can form tumors in immunocompromised mice. Civenni et al.67 reported that CD271
negative melanoma cells can form tumors in NSG mice but that they cannot form CD271+
progeny or tumors in NOD/SCID mice. In our hands, CD271 negative melanoma cells
readily form tumors in both NOD/SCID and NSG mice and all of the tumors are
heterogeneous for CD271 expression15,46. In an attempt to resolve the inconsistencies we
have compared the tumorigenic capacity of CD271+ and CD271 negative melanoma cells
isolated from multiple patients using our dissociation protocol15,46 as well as the
dissociation protocols described by Civenni et al.67 and Boiko et al.66. Irrespective of which
dissociation protocol we used, whether or not we injected the cells with Matrigel, or whether
we transplanted into NOD/SCID or NSG mice, both CD271+ and CD271 negative
melanoma cells readily formed tumors and all the tumors were heterogeneous for CD271
(unpublished data). We have now tested over 20 heterogeneously expressed markers in
tumors obtained from many patients but have not been able to detect any fraction of
melanoma cells that lacks the potential to form a tumor15,46.
Difficulty reproducing cancer stem cell markers has been a common problem in solid cancer
studies. For example, CD133 appeared to robustly distinguish tumorigenic from nontumorigenic brain tumor cells in early studies6,33 but a series of subsequent studies found
tumorigenic cells in both CD133+ and CD133 negative fractions68–71. Since the existence of
markers that can distinguish tumorigenic from non-tumorigenic cancer cells is the
experimental basis for the conclusion that these cancers follow the stem cell model, the
inability to widely confirm markers undermines the evidence supporting the model.

HHMI Author Manuscript

A related problem is that cancer stem cell markers originally characterized in a limited
number of tumors have often been assumed to be generalizable. Such markers have often
been used in other tumors, or even in cell lines, without independently confirming that the
markers were informative in these other contexts. For example, it was clear from the initial
study of breast cancer stem cells that the CD44+CD24− surface marker phenotype enriched
tumorigenic cells in some, but not all, breast cancers32. Yet many studies subsequently
characterized CD44+CD24− breast cancer stem cells in other tumors or cell lines without
confirming that these markers distinguished tumorigenic from non-tumorigenic cells in
those contexts. Consequently, many studies of cancer stem cell properties are based upon
markers of uncertain validity.

Variability among patients
One of the reasons for variability among studies is that markers expressed by tumorigenic
cells differ among patients. Early studies in AML indicated that leukemogenic cells were

Meacham and Morrison

highly enriched among CD34+CD38− cells but not CD34+CD38+ AML cells 29,30. More
recent studies with larger numbers of samples showed that while the CD34+CD38− fraction
consistently contains leukemogenic cells, leukemogenic activity is also commonly found in
the CD34+CD38+ and CD34− fractions43,65,72. Approximately half of AMLs have most
leukemogenic cells in the CD34+CD38− fraction while the other half have most
leukemogenic cells in the CD34+CD38+ fraction43,65. Many human AMLs with
nucleophosmin mutations have leukemogenic activity exclusively in the CD34− fraction,
while some have leukemogenic activity in both CD34− and CD34+ fractions73. This
indicates that differences in mutations can cause differences in the phenotype of
leukemogenic cells among patients. The same is true in solid cancers, as Sca1+ cells are
enriched for tumorigenic activity in mouse lung adenocarcinomas with Kras and p53
mutations but not in tumors with only Kras mutations74.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Differences among patients may also reflect differences in the cell-of-origin. For example,
some medulloblastomas arise in the cerebellum from sonic hedgehog pathway activation in
granule neuron precursors and frequently have a poor prognosis75. Other medulloblastomas
arise in the dorsal brainstem and are highly curable75. Similarly, neural progenitors from
different regions of the central nervous system form different subtypes of ependymomas
with different properties76. Both hematopoietic stem cells and restricted myeloid progenitors
can serve as the cell-of-origin for AML 53,77–79 but the leukemogenic cells have somewhat
different properties in each case 80. The distinct developmental origins of tumors, both with
respect to regional identity and position in the normal tissue hierarchy, contribute to
differences among patients in tumorigenic cell properties.
Tumorigenic cell phenotype can also change over time. In some ovarian cancers, only
CD133+ cells contain tumorigenic activity whereas in other ovarian cancers tumorigenic
cells are in the CD133+ and CD133 negative fractions 40. Ovarian cancers with only
CD133+ tumorigenic cells sometimes give rise to CD133 negative tumorigenic cells upon
passaging40. If tumorigenic cell phenotypes commonly change upon passaging of tumors,
this could explain some of the inconsistencies observed among studies that use small
numbers of tumors.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The frequency of tumorigenic cells in some cancers also varies widely among patients. Sideby-side studies of AMLs from different patients revealed frequencies of leukemogenic cells
in the CD34+CD38− cell fraction that varied 1000-fold 65. B-ALLs from different patients
had frequencies of leukemogenic cells that varied 100-fold 44. Ovarian cancers from
different patients had tumorigenic cell frequencies that varied almost 1000-fold 40. It
remains uncertain to what extent this reflects biological variability in the frequency of cells
that can contribute to tumor growth within patients as opposed to variability in the extent to
which transplantation assays are permissive for tumorigenesis by cells of different
genotypes. The variability in the frequency and identity of tumorigenic cells between
patients shows that markers identified in one tumor cannot be assumed to distinguish cancer
stem cells in other tumors or in other contexts.
A key question raised by the differences among patients is whether tumors of the same type
differ in the extent to which they are hierarchically organized. For example, one possibility

Meacham and Morrison

is that all breast cancers follow a stem cell model even though existing markers do not
distinguish tumorigenic from non-tumorigenic cells in some tumors. Another possibility is
that only a subset of breast cancers follows the stem cell model. Or perhaps the hierarchy is
steep in one subset of each cancer, with rare tumorigenic cells that give rise to abundant
non-tumorigenic cells, and shallow in another subset of each cancer, with common
tumorigenic cells that form small numbers of non-tumorigenic cells (Figure 2). Until enough
tumors are carefully studied to observe consistent patterns among patients with particular
subtypes of disease, tumors will have to be tested individually to determine whether
tumorigenic cells are common or rare and whether markers can distinguish tumorigenic
from non-tumorigenic cells.

Fate versus potential in tumors in vivo

HHMI Author Manuscript

Which cells actually contribute to the growth and progression of tumors in vivo? Most
cancer stem cell studies are designed to assess the identity of cancer cells with the potential
to contribute to tumor growth. A separate question relates to the identity of cells fated to
contribute to the growth and progression of specific tumors (Figure 1). The question of fate
addresses what cells actually do in a specific circumstance while the question of potential
addresses what cells can do under permissive conditions.
Some cells that have the potential to drive tumor growth do not actually do so in the native
tumor because they are not in a permissive environment, they are killed by immune cells, or
by therapy. In the native tumor slowly proliferating clones may be at a competitive
disadvantage to rapidly proliferating clones and therefore may not contribute much to tumor
growth. However, these slowly proliferating clones may form tumors after transplantation.
Environmental cues from stromal cells can restrict the growth of cancer cells in the native
tumor environment 81, but the absence of these cues may permit the same cells to form
tumors after transplantation. In some circumstances, a high percentage of cells with
tumorigenic potential may contribute to tumor growth (Figure 1). In other circumstances,
there may only be a small percentage of cells with tumorigenic potential that actually
contribute to tumor growth.

HHMI Author Manuscript

One context in which the fate of tumorigenic cells can be tracked is after xenotransplantion
of human cancer cells. Primary human colorectal cancer cells were marked by lentiviral
infection and the relative abundance of distinct clones was tracked as tumor cells were
serially transplanted 82. Individual clones differentially contributed to tumor growth over
time: some were always abundant, some were abundant then became rare, and some were
rare then became abundant. When human B-ALL cells from a single patient were
transplanted at limiting and non-limiting cell doses, different dominant clones emerged in
each recipient mouse44. Leukemogenic clones thus do not contribute equally over time after
transplantation.
Lineage tracing experiments have recently been performed in mouse models of benign
tumors to test whether many, or few, cells contribute to their growth 20,21. Mice bearing
benign papillomas were treated with low doses of tamoxifen, allowing Keratin14-CreER to
recombine a conditional reporter in a small percentage of papilloma cells20. These rare

marked clones were tracked over time to assess their contribution to tumor growth. The
frequency of clones declined over time, with only 20% persisting after seven weeks. Nonpersisting clones appeared to be lost through terminal differentiation. The average size of
persisting clones increased over time: by seven weeks the clones ranged from hundreds to
thousands of cells. These observations demonstrate that only a minor subpopulation of
tumor cells drives papilloma growth, though the rate at which these cells divide is increased
relative to what is observed in the normal epidermis 83. Benign papillomas are therefore
hierarchically organized, consistent with the stem cell model, though this is perhaps not
surprising for a benign tumor.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The same study also fate mapped cells in tumors after they progressed to squamous cell
carcinomas20. Cells in these tumors were more highly proliferative, more undifferentiated,
and formed larger clones as compared to cells in benign papillomas. A much greater
percentage of cells sustainably contributed to the growth of squamous cell carcinomas. The
squamous cell carcinomas in this study, therefore, have only a shallow hierarchy, with few
non-tumorigenic cells (Figure 2). Additional studies are required to determine whether there
is any hierarchical organization among the persisting clones - perhaps some have more
proliferative potential than others. Overall, the data suggest that as benign adenomas
progress to carcinomas, the hierarchy becomes more shallow and more cells can contribute
to tumor growth.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Schepers et al. used a multicolor conditional reporter to track the contribution of Lgr5+ cells
to the growth of pre-malignant intestinal adenomas21. Lgr5 expression marks normal stem
cells in the intestinal crypt 84. Administration of tamoxifen activated Lgr5-CreER
recombinase. This deleted the APC tumor suppressor in Lgr5+ cells, forming adenomas as
well as activating the expression of a multicolor reporter in Lgr5+ cells and their progeny 21.
Administration of a second pulse of tamoxifen reactivated Cre recombinase, recombining
the multicolor reporter again, leading to a color switch within some Lgr5+ cells in the
adenomas. Lgr5+ cells in the normal epithelium are thus capable of giving rise to adenomas
and the Lgr5+ cells within the adenomas can contribute extensively to tumor growth. Since
most of the progeny were Lgr5 negative cells it was speculated that Lgr5+ adenoma stem
cells give rise to Lgr5 negative cells with little proliferative capacity; however, the Lgr5
negative cells have not yet been fate mapped and it is unknown whether they have less
ability to contribute to tumor growth.
A recent study shows that Lgr5 negative cells can also act as the cell-of-origin for intestinal
adenomas in the context of Wnt pathway activation and inflammation. Adenomas that arise
in this context do not, based on currently available data, appear to follow the cancer stem
cell model22. The Lgr5 negative cells in these tumors give rise to Lgr5+ cells, but both Lgr5
negative cells and Lgr5+ cells can form spheroids in culture and tumors in vivo with similar
efficiency. This argues that at least some intestinal adenomas are not hierarchically
organized into Lgr5+ tumorigenic cells and Lgr5 negative non-tumorigenic cells. Additional
studies of the Lgr5+ and Lgr5 negative cell fractions from adenomas in more genetic
backgrounds will be required to assess what fraction of adenomas exhibit hierarchical
organization. It will also be important to test whether adenomas that do exhibit hierarchical

organization continue to exhibit hierarchical organization after they progress to
malignancies.

HHMI Author Manuscript

These lineage-tracing experiments thus provide limited support for the cancer stem cell
model. Although the growth of benign skin papillomas was driven by a minor subpopulation
of cells, a much larger fraction of cells contributed to the growth of squamous cell
carcinomas20. A key question now is whether some of the persistent clones that exhibit
ongoing contribution to tumor growth might nonetheless have limited tumorigenic potential
in transplantation assays. The data on intestinal adenomas also offer limited support for the
cancer stem cell model as both Lgr5+ and Lgr5 negative cells have the ability to serve as the
cell-of-origin and to propagate tumors upon transplantation, at least in certain genetic
backgrounds. Ultimately, it will be necessary to integrate the data from both transplantation
studies and fate mapping studies in significant numbers of human and mouse tumors to
understand the biological diversity.

Testing fate through selective cell ablation

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

The selective ablation of genetically defined subsets of tumor cells is another approach to
test which cells are fated to contribute to tumor growth or disease progression in the native
tumor environment. A recent study addressed the role of Nestin positive cells in the
maintenance of a mouse model of glioma by ablating these cells 19. GFP and the herpes
simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) were expressed under the control of the Nestin
promoter such that HSV-TK positive cells could be selectively killed upon administration of
ganciclovir. Nestin-expressing, GFP+ glioma cells were relatively quiescent and represented
a minority of cells in the gliomas. Administration of ganciclovir modestly extended the
lifespan of mice, indicating that the Nestin+ cells contribute to tumor growth. Importantly,
when tumors were reduced in size by treatment with the chemotherapeutic temozolomide,
pulse chase experiments suggested that tumor regrowth originated from the Nestin+ fraction
of tumor cells. Co-administration of temozolomide and ganciclovir significantly slowed
tumor re-growth; however, it was impossible to assess the long-term effects of eliminating
the Nestin+ cells because mice independently developed lethal tumors unrelated to the
original tumor. Consequently, it remains unclear if the Nestin+ cells are exclusively
responsible for driving tumor growth and recurrence after therapy or if the Nestin negative
cells also contribute. It would be particularly interesting to selectively ablate the Nestin
negative cells to determine whether this also slows tumor growth and extends mouse
lifespan.

Reversible plasticity among cancer cells
Some cancer cells reversibly transition among states that differ in their competence to
contribute to tumor growth85. For example, some cancer cells can reversibly transition
between epithelial and mesenchymal states and there is evidence that breast cancer cells in
the mesenchymal state are more competent to form tumors9. Melanoma cells reversibly turn
on and off the JARID1B histone demethylase, and JARID1B-expressing cells are more
competent to sustain tumor growth16. Many other markers are reversibly turned on and off
within lineages of melanoma cells in a manner that does not correlate with the ability to

form a tumor15,17. Exposure of glioma cells to perivascular nitric oxide reversibly promotes
their ability to form tumors13. The evidence that some cancer cells can undergo reversible
changes in their competence to form tumors offers an alternative explanation for the
increased tumorigenic potential of subsets of cancer cells independent of the differentiation
of cancer stem cells.
Drug resistance is also a plastic property of some cancer cells, with rare subpopulations in
cancer cell lines that exhibit resistance to a variety of therapeutics, reversibly forming
sensitive or resistant progeny depending on whether the cells are passaged with or without
the therapeutic18. This raises the possibility of intrinsic therapy resistance mechanisms that
are not necessarily associated with a static hierarchy or an undifferentiated state.

HHMI Author Manuscript

It is critical to distinguish models in which intrinsic differences in tumorigenic capacity
reflect reversible changes in cell state as compared to irreversible differentiation as these
models make very different experimental and clinical predictions (Figure 3). If the
heterogeneity within tumors reflects cells that reversibly and efficiently transition between
tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic states9,85 it may not be possible to experimentally identify
any population that lacks tumorigenic potential (Figure 3f). Furthermore, it would remain
necessary to eliminate all cancer cells during therapy, as even the non-tumorigenic cells
could drive disease recurrence by giving rise to tumorigenic cells (Figure 3i). In contrast, if
heterogeneity reflects hierarchical organization in which cancer stem cells irreversibly
differentiate into non-tumorigenic cells, then therapies that eliminate cancer stem cells
should be necessary and sufficient to cure disease (Figure 3a, g). This distinction is thus
critical to understand the underlying biology and to develop more effective therapies.
Importantly, almost all of the existing evidence for reversible transitions between
tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic states comes from studies of cells in culture, often cell
lines, so it remains uncertain to what extent this is observed within spontaneously arising
cancers in vivo.

Genetic heterogeneity within tumors

HHMI Author Manuscript

The conclusion that cancer stem cells can recapitulate the heterogeneity of the tumors from
which they derive has consistently been based on analyses of small numbers of surface
markers, calling into question the degree to which there is genetic heterogeneity within
tumors that is not recapitulated after the transplantation of tumorigenic cells86. If genetic
heterogeneity within tumors is low, then the differentiation of cancer stem cells into nontumorigenic progeny could be the major driver of heterogeneity (Figure 4). Conversely, if
genetic heterogeneity is extensive, every tumorigenic cell could form a genetically distinct
tumor rather than recapitulating the tumor from which it derives. In tumors with extensive
genetic heterogeneity, phenotypic and functional differences among cells cannot be assumed
to reflect the differentiation of cancer stem cells - they could reflect genetic differences.
With these questions as a backdrop it is interesting to consider the implications of recent
deep sequencing studies. Deep sequencing has been used to examine the genetic
heterogeneity within tumors, the subclonal composition of tumors, and the evolutionary
relationships of mutations during disease progression. Deep sequencing cannot directly test

the cancer stem cell model. However, the frequencies of allelic variants in bulk tumor cells
can be used to quantify the relative contribution of different clones to tumors. Even neutral
passenger mutations can be informative because by following the contribution of the cells
bearing these mutations to tumor growth and disease progression we gain insights into the
fates of individual cancer cells and their progeny. Data from AML25,87, CLL88, breast
cancer 27,89,90, renal cell carcinoma 28,91, and pancreatic cancers 92–94 show surprisingly
extensive genetic heterogeneity. Extensive genetic heterogeneity provides many
opportunities for genetic changes to confer phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within
tumors that is not addressed by the cancer stem cell model (and that may complicate the
testing of the model; Figure 3c, f, i).

HHMI Author Manuscript

It has long been understood that cancer cells undergo clonal evolution in which mutations
occur stochastically in individual cancer cells and then are subject to positive or negative
selection depending on whether they confer a competitive advantage or disadvantage12,95.
Cancer stem cells are no exception. Leukemogenic ALL cells obtained from the same
patient exhibit genetic heterogeneity and undergo genetic changes over time when passaged
in mice 24,44. It is not clear whether these ALLs follow the cancer stem cell model as
leukemogenic cells are common in some ALLs and it has proven difficult to identify any
clear hierarchical organization 61,96. Human colorectal tumors have also been serially
transplanted in mice and their genetic heterogeneity assessed 82. Only a small number of de
novo genetic variants were detected in serially transplanted tumors as compared to primary
patient samples. Since there is compelling evidence that colorectal cancers are hierarchically
organized into tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic components 34–36, these results show that
genetic changes do occur in colon cancer stem cells, though the paucity of such changes
raises the possibility that the rate of mutagenesis may be suppressed in those cells. There is
no inherent inconsistency between the cancer stem cell model and the clonal evolution
model4 (Figure 5).

Therapy resistance

HHMI Author Manuscript

Tumorigenic cells in certain cancers have been observed to be intrinsically resistant to
certain therapies. For example, tumorigenic glioblastoma 6 and breast cancer 7 cells were
enriched after irradiation of xenografts. A similar enrichment of tumorigenic cells was
observed in cyclophosphamide-treated colorectal tumors 97. Activation of ATM-dependent
DNA-damage repair in tumorigenic glioblastoma cells 6 and decreased reactive oxygen
species in tumorigenic breast cancer cells 7 may explain the therapy resistance of these cells.
Although it is sometimes suggested that cancer stem cells can be defined by therapy
resistance, this is not true in any general sense. Differentiation therapies specifically target
cancer stem cells by exploiting their capacity to differentiate. Acute promyelocytic
leukaemia (APL) is treated with arsenic trioxide and trans-retinoic acid to induce terminal
differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis by clonogenic APL cells 98. Mouse
glioblastoma stem cells can be induced to differentiate into glia by treating with bone
morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), reducing proliferation, tumor growth, and tumorigenic
cell frequency 99. BMP4 also promotes glial differentiation by normal CNS stem cells 100
suggesting that tumorigenic cancer cells sometimes inherit differentiation pathways from

normal stem cells in the same tissue. Cis-retinoic acid improves survival in high-risk
neuroblastoma patients 101,102 by inducing the differentiation of undifferentiated
neuroblastoma cells. Thus, tumorigenic cells are more sensitive to some therapies and less
sensitive to other therapies as compared to non-tumorigenic cells.
Genetic changes clearly confer therapy resistance in some circumstances103. Sequential
genetic analysis of cancers before therapy and after relapse have been consistent with this. In
ALL 24,26, AML 25, and CLL 88,104, minor subclones prior to therapy often become
dominant after therapy. If the inherent therapy resistance of cancer stem cells were the major
determinant of survival during therapy then dominant clones prior to therapy would be likely
to remain dominant after therapy. The observation that therapy selects for minor subclones
suggests that either survival is stochastic (many cells have a similar low probability of
surviving), non-cell-autonomously determined, or determined by genetic differences among
subclones.

When the dominant pre-therapy clone remains dominant after relapse, the dominant clone
often gains de novo mutations 25,26,88. Relapse-specific mutations may confer therapy
resistance. For example, recurrent relapse-specific mutations were identified in the gene
NTC52 in 10–20% of T-ALLs105,106. NT5C2 is a 5′ nucleotidase that can inactivate
nucleoside analogs, such as the chemotherapy drugs 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine
used to treat ALL. The relapse-specific NTC52 mutations are predicted to be gain-offunction mutations that enhance enzymatic activity105,106. Certain genetic changes are likely
sufficient for therapy resistance.

The intrinsic resistance of certain cancer stem cells to certain therapies likely collaborates
with genetic change to enable disease progression (Figure 6). CML follows a cancer stem
cell model as CML stem cells form terminally differentiated myeloid cells during chronic
phase 107. CML stem cells are inherently resistant to imatinib 54,108–110. Cells with features
of CML stem cells persist after therapy, even in patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic
remission 111. Imatinib is thought to restore the health of CML patients primarily by
eliminating differentiated CML cells. This profoundly reduces leukemia burden but leaves
CML stem cells lurking in the patients, ready to re-establish the disease upon
discontinuation of imatinib112,113. As long as patients are maintained on imatinib they
remain healthy, until a mutation arises in BCR-ABL that confers imatinib resistance 114,115.
In this way, the inherent imatinib-resistance of CML stem cells allows the disease to
smolder along in remission, but a genetic change is required for more robust imatinib
resistance and disease progression in the face of therapy.

Perspective
Cancer stem cell properties have been suggested to explain diverse unsolved clinical
problems yet these predictions have often not been carefully tested. The roles played by
other sources of heterogeneity (such as genetic) in disease progression have often not been
factored into such claims. Moreover, difficulties confirming solid cancer stem cell markers
have undermined efforts to confirm their existence in some cancers and to study their
biology. It remains unclear to what extent these difficulties reflect variation in marker

expression by cancer stem cells from different patients versus misguided efforts to apply the
stem cell model to cancers that lack hierarchical organization. The tendency not to publish
data that are difficult to interpret or inconsistent with the model exaggerates the extent to
which cancer stem cell markers are conserved among patients. It is time to critically test the
model and its predictions, to acknowledge when the data don’t fit the model, and to integrate
the data with other sources of heterogeneity when they do.
Tumorigenic cells are rare and phenotypically distinct in some cancers. In other cancers,
tumorigenic cells are common and phenotypically diverse with no clear hierarchical
organization. We do not yet know what fraction of cancers follow the stem cell model.

HHMI Author Manuscript

As we develop a more complete understanding of genetic heterogeneity within tumors there
may be some cancers in which genetic heterogeneity is the major driver of phenotypic and
functional heterogeneity. In some cancers with pervasive genetic heterogeneity it may not be
possible to rigorously test the cancer stem cell model as genetic differences within and
between tumors may make it impossible to identify any reproducible hierarchical
organization, even if there is differentiation to post-mitotic progeny. Some cancers may have
epigenetic heterogeneity that is not well described by the cancer stem cell model. Indeed, a
general question concerns the extent to which the phenotypic and functional properties of
cancer cells undergo reversible changes. New models of cancer heterogeneity/plasticity may
emerge.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In cancers that do not follow the stem cell model it will be important to demonstrate this, to
avoid fruitlessly focusing on small subpopulations of cancer cells that have no more capacity
to drive disease progression or therapy resistance than other cancer cells. In cancers that do
follow the stem cell model, it will be important to clarify the markers that can be used to
identify these cells and the contexts in which they work. It will also be critical to integrate
our understanding of the biology of these cells with our understanding of other sources of
heterogeneity to develop a realistic view of how each contributes to disease progression. For
example, it is possible in some cancers that clones with a hierarchy of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells may co-exist in the same tumors with clones that have lost their
hierarchical organization as a consequence of additional mutations. This would profoundly
complicate the testing of the model and undermine the extent to which it can explain clinical
behavior.
•

Cancer stem cell markers will have to be tested in larger numbers of patients15,40,65
to account for heterogeneity among patients and to determine whether certain
markers are more reliable in certain subsets of patients. This will provide insight
into whether only certain subtypes or stages of disease follow the cancer stem cell
model. Studies should not assume that markers that distinguish tumorigenic from
non-tumorigenic cells in one tumor will do so in other tumors.

•

To date, there is no evidence that any combination of cancer stem cell markers
isolates any cancer stem cell population to a high degree of purity. The inability to
purify any cancer stem cell is a profound impediment to characterizing the biology
of these cells with precision. Until a high degree of purity can be demonstrated,

claims related to the cell cycle distribution and gene expression profiles of “cancer
stem cells” will be of uncertain validity.

•

It will be informative to perform lineage tracing20,21 and selective cell ablation
experiments19 in more cancers and at more stages of disease to assess whether
many, or few, cells are fated to contribute to tumor growth and disease progression.

•

Studies of genetic heterogeneity should be integrated with studies of tumorigenic
potential to develop a more realistic understanding of the extent to which individual
tumorigenic cells recapitulate the heterogeneity of the tumor from which they
derive. In many cancers that follow the stem cell model, tumorigenic cells may
reproduce the cellular hierarchy but not the genotype of the tumor-of-origin.

Figure 1. Cancer cell fate versus potential

a, Transplantation assays assess the potential of cancer cells to form tumors. The ability of a
cell to form a tumor is context dependent: cells that can form a tumor under one set of
conditions may not form a tumor in other conditions. For this reason, tumorigenesis assays
must be conducted under the most permissive possible conditions so as not to underestimate
the spectrum of cells with tumorigenic potential. Factors such as the site of injection, the
genetic background of recipient mice, and co-injection of extracellular matrix all influence
the ability of cells to form tumors. Optimization of these and other parameters can
substantially increase the frequency of tumorigenic cells detected in various
cancers30,43,44,46,47. b and c, Lineage tracing or fate-mapping assays assess the actual fate of
tumor cells in a particular context, often the native tumor environment. Thus, while potential

measures what a cell can do under permissive conditions, fate measures what a cell actually
does in a particular context. Some cells with tumorigenic potential do not actually contribute
to tumor growth – for example because they are in a non-permissive environment or because
they are eliminated by immune effector cells. An important question is whether many (b) or
few (c) cells with tumorigenic potential actually contribute to tumor growth. It will be
important to integrate transplantation studies of tumorigenic potential with studies of cell
fate in the native tumor environment to assess the extent to which the cancer stem cell model
describes the growth and progression of individual cancers.

Figure 2. Various cancers may be hierarchically organized into subpopulations of tumorigenic
and non-tumorigenic cells but some hierarchies may be steep (a), with only rare tumorigenic
cells, while other hierarchies may be shallow, with common tumorigenic cells (b) or even rare
non-tumorigenic cells (c)

HHMI Author Manuscript

As hierarchies become increasingly shallow, the value of distinguishing between
tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells to understand cancer biology and improve therapy
declines.

a–c. The differentiation of tumorigenic cells into non-tumorigenic progeny may be
irreversible (a), inefficiently reversible (b), or readily reversible (c). d–f. This degree of
plasticity within cancer cell hierarchies influences the outcome of transplantation assays. If
differentiation is irreversible, non-tumorigenic cells should not form tumors after
transplantation (d). If differentiation is inefficiently reversible, non-tumorigenic cells will
inefficiently form tumors after transplantation (e). If cells efficiently and reversibly
transition between tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic states then cells in the non-tumorigenic
state should nonetheless form tumors after transplantation. Under these circumstances,
transplantation assays may not be able to distinguish between cells in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic states and it may not be experimentally possible to distinguish this model from
tumors that are composed entirely of tumorigenic cells (f). g–i, Plasticity within cancer cell
hierarchies also influences the predicted outcome of therapies that ablate tumorigenic cells.
If differentiation is irreversible, therapy will convert a hierarchically organized malignancy
to a benign tumor containing only non-tumorigenic cells (g). If differentiation is inefficiently
reversible, a single round of therapy will deplete but not eliminate tumorigenic cells (h). If
cells efficiently transition between tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic states then a single
round of therapy will have little effect on tumorigenic cell frequency (i).

Figure 4. Tumorigenic cells cannot recapitulate the heterogeneity of the tumors from which they
derive if those tumors have extensive genetic heterogeneity

If every tumorigenic cell carries a combination of common and unique mutations then none
of these cells will recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of the tumor from which they derive
- they will all give rise to genetically distinct tumors upon transplantation. They still may
give rise to hierarchically organized tumors with tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic
components, as in the tumor of origin. Nonetheless, if the genetic heterogeneity involves
mutations that influence cancer cell phenotype or function the genetic heterogeneity will
contribute to tumor heterogeneity through mechanisms independent of cancer stem cell
differentiation.

Figure 5. Clonal evolution and the differentiation of tumorigenic cells into non-tumorigenic cells
can independently, or jointly, contribute to tumor heterogeneity

a, New mutations can increase the heterogeneity within tumors as long as the mutations
influence cell phenotype or function. b, The differentiation of tumorigenic cells into nontumorigenic progeny creates heterogeneity within tumors. New mutations that occur in nontumorigenic cells would not be propagated (unless they restore tumorigenic potential). c, If
mutations occur in tumorigenic cells, then both clonal evolution and the differentiation of
tumorigenic cells into non-tumorigenic progeny contribute to tumor heterogeneity. This is
likely what occurs in cancers that follow the stem cell model. This means that phenotypic
and functional differences cannot automatically be ascribed to epigenetic differences among
tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells as genetic heterogeneity may contribute to some of
those differences.

Figure 6. Genetic changes and the inherent properties of tumorigenic cells can independently, or
jointly, contribute to therapy resistance

a, Genetic alterations can confer therapy resistance (e.g. ref105). b, Tumorigenic cells in
certain cancers are inherently resistant to certain therapies6,7,97. c, Tumorigenic cells may
persist despite therapy but may not be able to cause disease relapse due to an inability to
regenerate significant numbers of non-tumorigenic cells in the presence of therapy. The
acquisition of de novo mutations may enhance therapy resistance, enabling relapse and
disease progression. CML stem cells are thought to be inherently imatinib resistant, and to
persist in the presence of imatinib until they acquire an imatinib resistance mutation and
progress to blast cell crisis112–115.
