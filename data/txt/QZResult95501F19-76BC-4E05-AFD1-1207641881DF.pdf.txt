Abstract
Overexpression of erbB2 is associated with resistance to
apoptosis. We explored whether high level of erbB2 expression
by cancer cells allows their targeting using an erbB2-binding
peptide (LTVSPWY) attached to the proapoptotic A-tocopheryl succinate (A-TOS). Treating erbB2-low or erbB2-high
cells with A-TOS induced similar levels of apoptosis, whereas
A-TOS-LTVSPWY induced greater levels of apoptosis in erbB2high cells. A-TOS rapidly accumulated in erbB2-high cells
exposed to A-TOS-LTVSPWY. The extent of apoptosis induced
in erbB2-high cells by A-TOS-LTVSPWY was suppressed by
erbB2 RNA interference as well as by inhibition of either
endocytotic or lysosomal function. A-TOS-LTVSPWY reduced
erbB2-high breast carcinomas in FVB/N c-neu transgenic mice.
We conclude that a conjugate of a peptide targeting A-TOS to
erbB2-overexpressing cancer cells induces rapid apoptosis
and efficiently suppresses erbB2-positive breast tumors.

Introduction
Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as erbB2/HER2 (a product of the
c-neu gene), render cancer cells resistant to apoptosis treatment
and make patients with erbB2-positive carcinomas a therapeutic
challenge (1, 2). The major problem associated with high
expression of erbB2 is autophosphorylation of the receptor and
the ensuing activation of growth signaling pathways and proangiogenic and antiapoptotic mechanisms.
ErbB2 is overexpressed in f30% of breast cancers. A major
complication associated with its high expression is linked to
activation of Akt (3, 4), a serine/threonine kinase that promotes
cellular survival (5) due to phosphorylation of proteins like
caspase-9 (6), Bad (7), or Bax (8). Akt also causes activation of
nuclear factor-nB (9) that controls expression of prosurvival genes,
such as the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family members (10, 11)
and the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP (12).

We have studied the molecular mechanism of the proapoptotic
and antineoplastic activity of vitamin E analogues, epitomized by
the redox-silent a-tocopheryl succinate (a-TOS; refs. 13, 14). This
agent has been proven efficient in selective induction of apoptosis
in cancer cells (15) and in suppression of experimental cancer
(16–20). We showed that a-TOS can bypass mutations or
deficiencies in important tumor suppressor genes such as p53 or
p21Waf1/Cip1 (18). Recently, our results documented that a-TOS can
also kill breast cancer cells overexpressing erbB2 (21).
A limiting point in efficient delivery of anticancer drugs is their
uptake by malignant cells. Uptake of a-TOS is relatively slow
because it, most likely, relies on passive diffusion. This follows
from experiments, in which acidification of media enhanced
uptake by cancer cells of a-TOS, a weak acid, because its free
COOH group is protonated to a higher extent at lower pH (22).
We decided to explore whether targeting a-TOS to erbB2overexpressing cells by generating a vitamin E analogue conjugated to a specific peptide provides a method for its efficient
delivery to breast cancer cells resistant to conventional therapy.
We based our hypothesis on the report by Shadidi and Sioud (23),
who identified the heptapeptide LTVSPWY to target erbB2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to breast cancer cells, suppressing
expression of the c-neu gene. We show here that the peptide
a-TOS-LTVSPWY conjugate efficiently kills breast cancer cells
with high levels of erbB2. Our data suggest that peptides binding
to receptors expressed on cancer cells coupled to inducers of
apoptosis may efficiently target cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. ErbB2-low MCF-7 and erbB2-high MDA-MB-453 cells as
well as the MCF-7/HER2-18 cells stably transfected with an erbB2 vector
(24, 25) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and
antibiotics. To inhibit lysosomal function, culture medium was supplemented with 20 mmol/L NH4Cl. In some cases, cells were cotreated with
25 Amol/L each of the pan-caspase, caspase-8, or caspase-9 inhibitors
Z-VAD-FMK, Z-IETD-FMK, or Z-LEHD-FMK, respectively (Calbiochem, La
Jolla, CA).
Synthesis of A-TOS-peptide conjugate. The H-Tyr(t-Bu)-Trp(t-Boc)Pro-Ser(t-Bu)-Val-Thr(t-Bu)-Leu-Rink amide was prepared according to the
standard Fmoc protocol on a LIPS Vario Peptide synthesizer. All acylation
reactions were carried out for 1 h using a 10-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acids
activated with TBTU (1 equivalent) in the presence of DIPEA (2 equivalents)
and HOBt (1 equivalent). The NH2-terminal conjugation was carried out
by activation of a-TOS with 1 equivalent of PyBOP in the presence of
HOBt (1 equivalent) and DIPEA (2 equivalents). The conjugated peptide was
cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water
(95:2.5:2.5) for 2 h. The highly lipophilic peptide conjugate was extracted

with diethylether and validated by analysis with high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray-mass spectrometry (expected
MH+, 1378.8; found MH+, 1378.7).
Assessment of apoptosis, reactive oxygen species formation, and
mitochondrial potential. Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using the Annexin V method
as described elsewhere (26). Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were
assessed by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; ref. 27). Relative levels of the ROS signal
were expressed as a change in mean fluorescence intensity. The
mitochondrial inner trans-membrane potential (DW m) was assessed using
the polychromatic dye 5,5¶,6,6¶-tetrachloro-1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethylbenzimidoazolyl-carbocyanino iodide (JC-1) as detailed elsewhere (26), and the
population of cells with increased green fluorescence was estimated by
flow cytometry. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 2 h with
2.5 Amol/L mitochondrially targeted coenzyme Q (MitoQ), a triphenylphosphonium adduct of coenzyme Q that accumulates in the mitochondrial inner membrane and acts as an efficient scavenger of mitochondrial
ROS (28).
Western blotting. Cells were lysed and stored at 80jC until analysis.
Protein levels were quantified using the bicinchoninic assay. Protein
samples (80 Ag per lane) were denatured, resolved using 12.5% SDSPAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane
was blocked and incubated overnight with anti-dynamin-2 or anti-erbB2
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-h-actin IgG (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a loading control. After incubation with
a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary IgG (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL), the blots were developed using the ECL kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL).
Cell transfection. The plasmids used were Bcl-xL-EGFP (29) and
wild-type (WT) and dominant-negative (DN; K44A) dynamin-2 (30).
Transfections were carried out as described previously (26). In brief,

MDA-MB-453 cells at 50% to 70% confluence were supplemented with 5 Ag
DNA preincubated for 10 min with 10 AL LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life
Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and 1 mL Opti-MEM. After 3 to 4 h, cells
were washed and supplemented with complete DMEM and left for 24 h, at
which stage the cells were incubated with complete DMEM supplemented
with G418. The cells were maintained in the selection medium for at least
five passages and assessed for protein expression by fluorescence
microscopy (Bcl-xL) or Western blotting (dynamin-2).
RNA interference. ErbB2-specific and validated short interfering RNA
(siRNA) oligonucleotides and nonspecific scrambled siRNA were purchased
from Ambion (Austin, TX). Transfection of MDA-MB-453 cells with siRNA
was done as reported elsewhere (27). Briefly, cells were allowed to reach
f50% confluency and supplemented with 60 pmol/L siRNA preincubated
with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and overlayed with OptiMEM. Cells were washed 24 h later with PBS, overlayed with complete
DMEM, and cultured for additional 24 h, and transgene expression was
confirmed before using the cells for further experiments.
Endocytosis assay. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, mediated by
endocytosis dependent on the LDL receptor, was assessed as reported (31).
LDL was labeled with the fluorescent dye 1,1¶-dioctadecyl-3,3,3¶,3¶-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) for 8 h at 37jC. MDA-MB-453
parental cells, and the WT and DN dynamin-2 transfectants at f50%
confluency were incubated with DiI-labeled LDL for 2 h at 37jC, and the
level of internalized DiI-LDL estimated by flow cytometry. Endocytosis was
also assessed using FITC-conjugated transferrin (FITC-Tr). In brief, FITC-Tr
(Molecular Probes) at 0.1 mg protein per mL was added to cells at f50%
confluency; the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37jC
and assessed by flow cytometry.
Mouse tumor experiments. A colony of transgenic FVB/N202 c-neu
mice carrying the rat HER-2/neu proto-oncogene driven by the mouse
mammary tumor virus promoter on the H-2q FVB/N background (32) was
established at the Griffith University Animal Facility and maintained

under strict inbreeding conditions. The presence of the transgene was
routinely confirmed by PCR. Some 70% of the female mice developed
spontaneous mammary carcinomas with a mean latency time of >7
months. Female transgenic FVB/N c-neu mice bearing progressively
growing tumors with mean volume of 25 mm3 were randomly assigned
to control or treatment groups. Tumor size was quantified by ultrasound
imaging using the Vevo770 instrument and the 40-MHz RMV704 scan-head
(both Visualsonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) allowing 40-Am resolution
of individual scans as well as by digital calipers. Mice received treatment
with the excipient (corn oil/4% ethanol) alone (control), 15 or 5 Amol
a-TOS, or 5 or 2.5 Amol a-TOS-LTVSPWY given by i.p. injection every 3 to
4 days.
Animal experiments were done according to the guidelines of the
Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care and Use of Animals in
Research and Teaching and were approved by the Griffith University Animal
Ethics Committee.
A-TOS analysis. Intracellular levels of a-TOS were quantified using an
HPLC method (33).
Statistics. Data were obtained from at least three different experiments,
and the results are presented as mean F SD. Significance between data
points was assessed using the Student’s t test, and data were considered
significantly different when P < 0.05.

Results
We first tested whether conjugating a-TOS to a peptide
recognized by erbB2 would target the vitamin E analogue to cells
overexpressing the receptor. To do this, we prepared a conjugate of
a-TOS with the heptapeptide LTVSPWY by its addition to the free
carboxylate on the succinyl moiety of the vitamin E ester. We found
that erbB2-low (MCF-7) and erbB2-high cells (MCF-7/HER2-18 and
MDA-MB-453) were all similarly sensitive to a-TOS, whereas erbB2low cells were relatively resistant to a-TOS-LTVSPWY (Fig. 1).
However, the peptide conjugate of a-TOS was significantly more
effective in inducing apoptosis in erbB2-high cells than was a-TOS
(Fig. 1). The LTVSPWY peptide itself did not induce any detectable
apoptosis (data not shown).
Previous reports showed that a-TOS induced apoptosis by the
intrinsic pathway (26, 27, 34, 35). We tested whether mitochondria
and the ensuing events are also involved in killing of MDA-MB453 cells exposed to a-TOS-LTVSPWY. We first studied the effect
of a-TOS-LTVSPWY on generation of ROS and dissipation of
DW m as early indicators of apoptosis preceding the onset of the
commitment phase. Figure 2A and B documents that the peptide
conjugate caused a more rapid accumulation of ROS and DW m
dissipation in MDA-MB-453 cells than did a-TOS. MitoQ is a
potent antioxidant that is targeted to the mitochondrial inner
membrane (27), and using this agent revealed that the effect of aTOS-LTVSPWY on mitochondrial destabilization was caused by
mitochondrially derived ROS because inhibition of ROS accumulation and dissipation of DW m by the addition of MitoQ also
inhibited the peptide conjugate–induced apoptosis (data not
shown). We next tested whether apoptosis induced by a-TOSLTVSPWY was dependent on caspases. Figure 2C shows that the
pan-caspase inhibitor and the caspase-9 inhibitor suppressed
apoptosis induction in MDA-MB-453 cells exposed to both a-TOSLTVSPWY and a-TOS, whereas this was not observed in case of
the caspase-8 inhibitor. We also studied whether overexpression
of the mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL protects MDAMB-453 cells from apoptosis induced by a-TOS-LTVSPWY. Figure
2D shows that apoptosis induced by a-TOS-LTVSPWY was
inhibited in erbB2-overexpressing cells transfected with Bcl-xL.
Collectively, these data confirm that mitochondria are important

for apoptosis induction by the peptide conjugate in erbB2overexpressing cells.
To find out whether rapid killing of MDA-MB-453 cells by
a-TOS-LTVSPWY was due to high levels of erbB2, we knocked
down the receptor using erbB2 siRNA. Figure 3A shows that
siRNA treatment for 48 h suppressed expression of erbB2. MDAMB-453 cells pretreated with erbB2 siRNA were significantly
more resistant to a-TOS-LTVSPWY but not to a-TOS alone
(Fig. 3B).
A plausible explanation for the greater efficacy of apoptosis
induced in erbB2-overexpressing cells by a-TOS-LTVSPWY is that
the conjugate is rapidly endocytosed. To address this, we inhibited
endocytosis of MDA-MB-453 cells by overexpression of DN
dynamin-2 (30). Figure 4A reveals that the transfected cells
expressed higher levels of either the WT or DN dynamin-2, and
that the resulting inhibition of endocytosis suppressed apoptosis
induced in MDA-MB-453 cell by the a-TOS-peptide conjugate,
whereas levels of apoptosis triggered by a-TOS alone in either
the control or the endocytosis-inhibited cells were not affected.
Figure 4A (inset) documents that DN dynamin-2 inhibits endocytosis because overexpression of DN dynamin-2 inhibited the uptake
of both LDL and transferrin.
An important feature of the peptide conjugate of a-TOS is
that the bond between the heptapeptide and the vitamin E
analogue can be hydrolyzed once inside cells, liberating the
apoptogenic, free a-TOS. This follows from our previous work, in
which we showed that masking the free carboxylate of vitamin E
analogues by methylation negated their ability to kill cancer
cells (36, 37). We tested whether lysosomal function was
important for apoptosis induction by a-TOS-LTVSPWY due to
presence of peptidases in the organelles. Addition of ammonium
chloride to cells, which buffers the acidic pH of lysosomes,
suppressed apoptosis induction in MDA-MB-453 cells by a-TOSLTVSPWY, whereas apoptosis induced by a-TOS alone was not
affected (Fig. 4B). This suggests involvement of lysosomes in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

conversion of the a-TOS-peptide conjugate into the proapoptotic a-TOS.
The above results support a role for overexpression of erbB2 in
rapid uptake of a-TOS-LTVSPWY and in liberating the apoptogenic
a-TOS. We therefore evaluated whether intracellular levels of free
a-TOS in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells were altered after
exposure to a-TOS-LTVSPWY or a-TOS. Figure 5 shows that
MCF-7 cells accumulated free a-TOS more rapidly when exposed to
the vitamin E analogue than when incubated with a-TOSLTVSPWY. On the other hand, MDA-MB-453 cells accumulated
free a-TOS fast when exposed to a-TOS-LTVSPWY, while showing
slow a-TOS accumulation when exposed to the free vitamin E
analogue. Very slow kinetics of a-TOS accumulation was observed
when MDA-MB-453K44A cells were exposed to a-TOS-LTVSPWY
(Fig. 5B), or when MDA-MB-453 cells were exposed to the peptide
conjugate of the vitamin E analogue in the presence of ammonium
chloride (Fig. 5C).
To determine the anticancer efficacy of the peptide conjugate
of a-TOS, transgenic mice were used that spontaneously form
ductal breast carcinomas due to overexpression of erbB2 in the
mammary epithelial cells (32). Female mice that developed
breast tumors were injected with a-TOS (15 or 5 Amol per
mouse per dose) or a-TOS-LTVSPWY (5 or 2.5 Amol per mouse
per dose), and the volume of the tumors was measured by
ultrasound imaging, allowing precise quantification of tumors,
as well as by calipers. Figure 6 shows that treatment with the
peptide conjugate at 5 Amol reduced the initial volume of breast
carcinomas by some 70% at a 3-fold lower dose than that of
a-TOS, which reduced the tumors by about 50%. The effect of
the a-TOS-peptide conjugate at 2.5 Amol was initially similar to
that of a-TOS at 15 Amol but failed to reduce the tumor size, as
observed also for a-TOS at 5 Amol. The effect of reduction in
tumor size was apparent after one dose of the peptide-a-TOS
conjugate at 5 Amol, whereas this was delayed when a-TOS at
15 Amol was used. We also compared the use of ultrasound

imaging and calipers for monitoring tumor volume. The data
shown in Fig. 6A and B clearly document the superiority of
ultrasound imaging over calipers. In many cases, majority of the
tumor is embedded in the body of the animal with as little as
10% of the tumor accessible for mechanical measurement.

Discussion
We present here a novel paradigm for cancer therapy based
on conjugation of anticancer agents with peptides recognized by
cell surface receptors preferentially expressed by malignant cells.
The evidence we have provided for this strategy here involves
modification of an apoptogenic compound from the group of
vitamin E analogues (a-TOS) with a peptide recognized by the
tyrosine receptor kinase erbB2. We show that (a) the conjugate
of a-TOS and the heptapeptide LTVSPWY caused greater levels
of apoptosis in erbB2-high than erbB2-low cells; (b) downregulation of erbB2 partially inhibited a-TOS-LTVSPWY–induced
apoptosis in erbB2-high cells; (c) apoptosis induced by a-TOSLTVSPWY in erbB2-high cells was dependent on endocytosis
and lysosomal function; and (d) that a-TOS-LTVSPWY efficiently
suppressed the growth of breast carcinomas in c-neu transgenic
mice.
Our hypothesis was based on a study by Shadidi and Sioud (23),
showing that addition of specific peptides to small molecules

rendered them selective for breast cancer cells. Using the phage
display approach, they identified a specific heptapeptide
(LTVSPWY) whose attachment to the green fluorescent protein
caused rapid internalization of the fluorescent protein by breast
cancer cells expressing erbB2. We document here that a-TOSLTVSPWY was more rapidly endocytosed by erbB2-overexpressing
cells than by erbB2-low cells.
Shadidi and Sioud (23) presented data from experiments using
the peptide targeting the erbB2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides,
which resulted in specific down-regulation of the receptor.
Supported by our results, we present an intriguing paradigm for
cancer therapy because this approach can be used for targeting
of divergent molecules to cells overexpressing specific surface
receptors. Molecules delivered by this approach include antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides, ribozymes, and siRNAs, the targeting of
which may be used in treatment of different pathologies without
adversely affecting healthy tissue (38–42). There are reports that
describe targeting of cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells encapsulated
in carriers, including peptide-coated liposomes, as documented in
both in vitro and in vivo models (43, 44).
Our results are consistent with those of Song et al. (41), who
showed that an erbB2 single-chain antibody fused with protamine
targeted erbB2 siRNA preferentially to erbB2-overexpressing
breast carcinoma cells. We present data showing that erbB2-high
breast cancer cells are more prone to killing by a-TOS-LTVSPWY

than their erbB2-low counterparts. Thus, the difference in the
levels of the receptor determines, at least to some extent, the
susceptibility of the cells to the peptide conjugate of a-TOS.
The erbB2-low MCF-7 underwent apoptosis when challenged with

a-TOS-LTVSPWY, albeit at a lower rate than did erbB2-high cells,
most probably reflecting the greatly reduced levels of the receptor
in these cells (45), which results in reduced binding and uptake of
the peptide conjugate. Hence, the level of expression of erbB2 was
shown to provide selective killing by the peptide conjugate, and
we can expect that normal cells, with low erbB2 expression, will
not be killed by the peptide-vitamin E analogue conjugate.
Our results with cells in which endocytosis was blocked by
overexpression of DN dynamin-2 suggest that internalization of
a-TOS-LTVSPWY by breast cancer cells is dependent on endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles because dynamin-2 is essential
for the formation and release of these vesicles and their conversion
into endosomes (29). Therefore, it can be postulated that after
binding to the erbB2 receptor, the peptide with the drug is
endocytosed. In the mildly acidic late endosome, the receptor is
detached from the a-TOS-peptide conjugate, which travels to the
lysosome, where acidic peptidases liberate free a-TOS from the
peptide conjugate. This is an important event in the peptide-a-TOS
processing by the cell because free carboxylate is required for
the proapoptotic activity of a-TOS (36, 37). Free vitamin E
succinate then induces apoptosis by targeting mitochondria,
leading to ROS generation and dissipation of DW m followed by
activation of caspases and entry of the cell to the commitment
phase of apoptosis (cf. Fig. 2; refs. 26, 35).
Importantly, efficient uptake of the peptide conjugate of a-TOS
results in pronounced suppression of breast carcinomas, as
documented by experiments with c-neu transgenic mice expressing
high levels of erbB2 in the mammary epithelial cells (32). Data in
Fig. 6 reveal that the peptide conjugate was more efficient than
when a-TOS alone was used at thrice higher doses. The superiority
of the peptide conjugate may be due to both greater selective uptake
by the erbB2-high cancer cells and greater efficacy of the conjugate
to deliver free a-TOS inside the cells, resulting in rapid apoptosis.
In summary, we present in this report an intriguing paradigm
for cancer therapy, according to which an inducer of apoptosis,
epitomized by a-TOS, is modified by addition of the peptide
LTVSPWY. The conjugate is rapidly endocytosed by erbB2overexpressing cells and internalized within endosomes. Their
maturation into lysosomes results in hydrolysis of a-TOSLTVSPWY by the action of acidic peptidases. The liberated aTOS, a potent mitocan (46, 47), then compromises the
mitochondrial function via generation of ROS and dissipation of
DW m. This leads to activation of the mitochondria-specific
caspase-9 and entry of the cell into the apoptosis commitment
phase. This approach, based on targeting of anticancer drugs to
malignant cell, may be of clinical relevance.

Figure 6. a-TOS-LTVSPWY suppresses
breast carcinomas. FVB/N c-neu female
mice at 7 to 10 months of age with breast
carcinomas, as detected by ultrasound
imaging, were treated by i.p injection of the
vehicle, 15 or 5 Amol per mouse per dose
of a-TOS, or 5 or 2.5 Amol per mouse per
dose of a-TOS-LTVSPWY (a-TOS-P). The
tumors were visualized and quantified
using ultrasound imaging (A ) or calipers
(B) and are expressed relative to their
volume at the onset of the treatment.
C, representative images of a tumor from
an animal treated with 5 Amol a-TOSLTVSPWY at times shown. Points, mean
(n = 4–6); bars, SD. *, significant
differences between the control animals
and animals treated with a-TOS-peptide
at 5 Amol per dose per mouse.
