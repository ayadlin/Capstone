BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy, the standard of care for locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), can cause life-threatening pneumonitis and esophagitis. X-ray (photon)-based radiation therapy (RT)
often cannot be given at tumoricidal doses without toxicity to proximal normal tissues. We hypothesized that proton
beam therapy for most patients with NSCLC could permit higher tumor doses with less normal-tissue toxicity than
photon RT delivered as 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). METHODS: We
compared the toxicity of proton therapyþconcurrent chemotherapy in 62 patients with NSCLC (treatment period
2006-2008) with toxicity for patients with similar disease given 3D-CRTþchemotherapy (n ¼ 74; treatment period
2001-2003) or IMRTþchemotherapy (n ¼ 66; treatment period 2003-2005). Proton therapy to the gross tumor volume was given with weekly intravenous paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area under the curve 2 mg/mL/min).
The primary endpoint was toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0). RESULTS: Median
follow-up times were 15.2 months (proton), 17.9 months (3D-CRT), and 17.4 months (IMRT). Median total radiation
dose was 74 Gy(RBE) for the proton group versus 63 Gy for the other groups. Rates of severe (grade 3) pneumonitis and esophagitis in the proton group (2% and 5%) were lower despite the higher radiation dose (3D-CRT, 30% and
18%; IMRT, 9% and 44%; P<.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher doses of proton radiation could be
delivered to lung tumors with a lower risk of esophagitis and pneumonitis. A randomized comparison of IMRT versus

Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in the United States and in most urbanized countries.
More than three-quarters of patients have the nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histotype. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for localized NSCLC, but more than one-third of patients present with locally advanced, unresectable
tumors. Concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy is believed to offer these patients the highest potential for prolonged disease-free and overall survival.1
The main problems associated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy for lung cancer are acute and subacute toxicity, primarily esophageal reactions with odynophagia and treatment-related pneumonitis that can be life-threatening or lethal. These toxic effects adversely affect quality of life for the patients and limit the dose of radiation that can be
administered. Advances in radiation techniques such as highly conformal intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
or proton therapy may reduce the risk of pneumonitis.2
Proton beam therapy differs from traditional x-ray (photon) therapy in that the maximum dose is concentrated in
the tumor and the dose beyond the tumor is negligible. Treatment planning studies suggest that higher tumor doses can
be achieved with proton therapy than with advanced x-ray techniques for locally advanced NSCLC, with a lower risk of
common side effects.3

Proton Therapy for Lung Cancer/Sejpal et al

Proton therapy was initiated at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in May 2006 with a
specific program in combined-modality treatment for
NSCLC. We report here our early experience with acute
and subacute toxicity from proton therapy and concurrent
chemotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between May 2006 and June 2008, 62 consecutive
patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC were
enrolled in 1 of 2 phase 2 clinical trials that had been
approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board. All participants provided written
informed consent. The first protocol (NCT00495170)
enrolled patients with previously untreated stage 3
NSCLC (according to the 2002 staging system of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer4). The other protocol (NCT00991094) had more permissive inclusion
criteria, allowing enrollment of patients with NSCLC at
any stage, prior malignant tumors, and postoperative
recurrences. Patients in the second protocol were typically
selected for proton therapy because of comorbid conditions, especially limited pulmonary function. This early
report of acute toxicity includes patients from both trials.
Pretreatment Evaluation and Exclusion
Criteria
Findings from a complete history and physical examination, including performance status, weight loss, and concurrent nonmalignant disease, were recorded. Exclusion
criteria were prior thoracic irradiation, malignant pleural
effusion, Karnofsky performance status5 score <60, and
weight loss >10% during the 6 months before diagnosis.
Laboratory studies included complete blood counts with
differential and platelet count and measurement of serum
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. Plain
chest films, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and
upper abdomen, and positron emission tomography (PET)
were required. Mediastinal lymph nodes suspected of harboring disease but with negative PET findings were
sampled via mediastinoscopy with biopsy or by bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography and fine needle
aspiration. CT or magnetic resonance imaging scans of the
brain were required before proton therapy; pulmonary
function tests were recommended but not required. Disease

was staged according to the 2002 criteria of the American
Joint Committee on Cancer.4
Treatments
Radiation therapy

All patients in the proton group received concurrent
proton therapy and chemotherapy; no patient in the proton group received x-ray (photon) irradiation as any component of treatment. Proton therapy was delivered using a
variable energy synchrotron in doses expressed as
Gy(RBE), where Gy is the absorbed dose and RBE (relative biological effectiveness) is the radiation weighting factor, which was 1.1. We used 3-dimensional (3D)
conformal techniques to plan and deliver the proton therapy, with 2-4 fields used for each patient.3 Treatment simulations took place while the patients lay supine, with
arms extended over the head, in a custom-fitted vacuum
cushion (Vac-Lok, CIVCO Medical Solutions, Kalona,
Iowa) that also immobilized the lower extremities. Fourdimensional CT6 was used to identify the path of the
tumors throughout the respiratory cycle. Tumor delineation was aided by PET. Gross tumor volume (GTV)
included all nodal disease documented via imaging (CT
or PET) or tissue analysis (mediastinoscopy or bronchoscopy). Ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes were included in the
GTV if mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes showed
evidence of disease. Contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, or supraclavicular lymph nodes were included
in the GTV only when those nodes showed abnormalities
on imaging or pathological analysis. For the 26 patients
(42%) who received induction chemotherapy, the GTV
consisted of gross disease measured after chemotherapy
plus any lymph node stations considered abnormal before
chemotherapy. An 8-mm margin was extended beyond
the GTV for presumed microscopic tumor extension.
Another 5-mm margin was added to account for range
and set-up uncertainties.
Constraints on the radiation doses to specific organs
were:
Spinal cord: 0% to receive 45 Gy(RBE);
Normal lung: <35% to receive 20 Gy(RBE); mean
dose to entire lung: <20 Gy(RBE);
Heart: <100% to receive 40 Gy(RBE); <50% to
receive 50 Gy(RBE);
Esophagus: <50% to receive 60 Gy(RBE).
Chemotherapy

All patients received concurrent carboplatin-andpaclitaxel chemotherapy as weekly intravenous infusions

during proton therapy. Paclitaxel was administered at 50
mg/m2 of body surface area, and carboplatin was given at
an area under the curve level of 2 mg/mL/min. Standard
anti-emetics were allowed at the discretion of the medical
oncologist. Concurrent chemotherapy could be withheld
or the doses modified if toxicity was encountered as follows. If the absolute neutrophil count decreased to
<1000/lL or the platelet count decreased to <75,000/
lL, carboplatin and paclitaxel were withheld until the
myelosuppression resolved. If grade 3 dysphagia appeared, weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel were withheld
and then readministered at 50% of the original dose at the
discretion of the medical oncologist.
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy at systemic
doses were allowed in either trial. The choice of chemotherapy type, dosing, and timing was at the discretion of
the treating physicians. Only the chemotherapy given concurrently with the proton therapy was standardized.
Treatment Evaluation
Patients were evaluated at least weekly during treatment,
at 4-6 weeks after treatment, and then every 3 months for
2 years and every 6 months thereafter. Adverse events
were scored using Common Terminology Criteria version
3.0. The first follow-up visit included an interval medical
history and physical examination, hematological studies,
chest x-ray, and CT examination. A follow-up PET examination was conducted during the first 3 to 4 months after
treatment. Thereafter, chest x-ray plus CT examinations
were alternated with PET examinations.
Data on survival, time to progression, and failure
patterns are being collected in the ongoing phase 2 trials.
Early information on survival is reported here for
completeness.
Comparison Groups
This report focuses on early toxicity of proton beam therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. The results are compared with historical results from 2 previously approved
retrospective chart reviews of toxicity after x-ray (photon)
RT (either IMRT2,7 or 3D conformal RT [3D-CRT]8)
with concurrent chemotherapy as definitive treatment for
locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy has been the standard of care at the
MD Anderson Cancer Center since the 1990s, although
radiation delivery techniques evolved from 2-dimensional
CRT to 3D-CRT in the late 1990s and then to IMRT in
the early 2000s. We chose 2 comparison groups because
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network still

3006

considers 3D-CRT with concurrent chemotherapy the
standard of care for NSCLC (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/nscl.pdf) and because our
institutional experience suggests that IMRT is associated
with less pulmonary toxicity than 3D-CRT.7 The median
radiation dose in both comparison groups was 63 Gy; the
survey periods were 2001-2003 for 3D-CRT and 20032005 for IMRT.2,7,8
Statistical Analyses
Stata/SE 11.1 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas)
was used for data analyses. Pearson’s chi-square test was
used to assess measures of association in frequency tables.
Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The equality of means for continuous variables was
assessed using t tests. P.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical tests were based on a 2-sided significance level. Mantel-Haenszel estimates were used to assess
specific interactions between disease stage and toxicity
grade by treatment group.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics, treatment characteristics, and follow-up information for all 3 groups are shown in Table 1.
Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in the prospective trial
of proton beam therapy for previously untreated stage 3
NSCLC, and 25 patients were enrolled in the trial that
allowed disease at other stages. The median total proton
dose was 74 Gy(RBE). Details of concurrent chemotherapy are also shown in Table 1. The median number of
concurrent weekly chemotherapy cycles was 6; 23% of
patients experienced treatment delays, 13% required
chemotherapy dose reductions, and 10% did not complete the full course of concurrent chemotherapy.
Twenty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(median 3 cycles of systemic dose chemotherapy). Eight
patients were known to proceed to adjuvant chemotherapy after a median 2 cycles of concurrent treatment.
Toxicity for all 3 patient groups is shown in Table 2.
No differences in hematological toxicity (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia) were found
between groups (data not shown). The most common
toxicity of concurrent proton therapy and chemotherapy
(experienced by 60 patients [97%]) was dermatitis; in
most cases this was mild, with only 15 patients (24%)
experiencing grade 3 reactions. Esophageal reactions, usually odynophagia, were observed in 49 (79%) patients; 27
(43%) patients experienced grade 2 or higher reactions

DISCUSSION
This is the first report of proton beam therapy with concurrent chemotherapy for NSCLC that permits evaluation of acute and subacute toxicity. We recognize that any
comparison of treatment outcomes that involves 1 or
more retrospective components will be associated with

3010

selection bias; nevertheless, we believe that historical comparisons such as the ones made here are important.
Unresectable NSCLC is far more common and lethal than the other diseases treated with proton therapy to
date. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy has emerged as
the treatment of choice for unresectable NSCLC, but the
sensitivity of the normal lung limits the radiation doses
that can be delivered. Local control rates at conventional
radiation doses are poor, ranging from 20% to 50%,
depending on the method of evaluation.9 Findings from a
phase 1/2 trial by the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG),10 a phase 1 trial by the North Central
Cancer Treatment Group,11 and a phase 2 trial by the

Cancer and Leukemia Group B12 confirm that the maximum tolerated dose of x-ray (photon) therapy, given as
3D-CRT with paclitaxel- and carboplatin-based chemotherapy, is 74 Gy. If the use of protons allowed the radiation dose to the tumor to be increased without increasing
the toxicity of the concurrent treatment, this could be an
important factor in improving outcome.
Concurrent chemoradiation therapy has been the
standard of care for locally advanced NSCLC at the MD
Anderson Cancer Center since the 1990s. The transition
from 2D-RT to 3D-CRT took place in 1997.13,14 The
transition from 3D-CRT to IMRT occurred in 2004, and
results comparing these 2 techniques have been reported
elsewhere.2,7 Studies of tumor motion and methods of
managing it also took place during 2003-20056 and were
used as the basis for addressing tumor motion with IMRT
and with proton therapy. Nevertheless, when this report
was written, IMRT was not considered standard throughout the United States, which led to our including a comparison group treated with 3D-CRT as well as another
group treated with IMRT during the past decade.
This report focuses only on acute and subacute toxicity, because our follow-up time is too short to evaluate
tumor control and survival. Findings from other trials of
concurrent chemoradiation therapy for NSCLC are
shown in Table 5.10,12,15-20 Notably, our median total
dose from proton therapy as reported here was 74
Gy(RBE), which is more than 15% higher than the standard 63-Gy dose used in most NSCLC trials such as
RTOG 9410.21 Both phase 2 trials that used 74 Gy (photons) with carboplatin and paclitaxel10,12 have shown substantially higher rates of severe (grade 3) pneumonitis
than the current experience (Table 5). Rates of severe
esophagitis are more difficult to compare directly, because

Cancer

the RTOG report10 included only grade 2 esophagitis.
Nevertheless, the rate of grade 2 esophagitis in that
study (40%) compared favorably with the rate in the current study (43%).
Treatment-related pneumonitis is the most serious
adverse effect of radiation or chemoradiation in NSCLC.
It occurs predominantly within 6 months of treatment22
and can contribute to the death of patients. In the MD
Anderson Cancer Center experience with 3D-CRT given
at a median total dose of 63 Gy, 32% of patients had treatment-related pneumonitis of grade 3 or higher.2 Pneumonitis is well known to be related to the volume of normal
lung irradiated22-25; hence in cooperative group studies, a
limit is placed on the volume of normal lung that can
receive a total dose of 20 Gy or more. Findings from treatment planning studies3 suggest that proton beam therapy
could decrease the volume of normal lung irradiated compared with x-ray treatments (3D-CRT and IMRT) even
while delivering higher total radiation doses to the tumor.
Our experience to date supports this hypothesis.
Esophageal reactions are rarely life-threatening, but
the odynophagia resulting from concurrent chemoradiation therapy can profoundly hinder quality of life during
treatment and for weeks thereafter. Such reactions are relatively common (Tables 2, 4, 5); in an RTOG study of the
cytoprotectant amifostine to reduce dysphagia and odynophagia from concurrent chemoradiation for NSCLC,19
the rate of severe (grade 3) esophageal reactions was
34% in the control (no-amifostine) group (n ¼ 122). In
the present study, we found that proton beam therapy
produced severe esophagitis in only 5% of patients.
The relatively high rate of dermatitis in the proton
group probably reflects the higher surface dose of protons
versus photons and the use of relatively few proton beams
(2-4 per patient) to minimize the exposure of normal lung
tissue. In any event, dermatitis associated with proton
therapy was rarely severe (24% grade 3 and no grade 4-5
[Table 2]) and was effectively treated with supportive
measures without the need to delay therapy.
Our study did have several shortcomings related to
the use of retrospective data for comparison, including
substantial differences in pretreatment assessments (especially imaging) and treatment-planning capabilities7 over
the periods of study and the heterogeneity of the patient
populations. The difference in baseline GTV between the
3 groups in particular could be attributable to heterogeneity of disease stage, but also to the increasing use of more
rigorous evaluations of nodal disease (eg, PET, endoscopic
ultrasonography) and the development of highly

3011

conformal planning and delivery techniques over the periods of study, both of which might be expected to lead to
smaller GTVs. The proton therapy group was itself somewhat heterogeneous because of the inclusion of 25 patients
with any stage (including recurrent) disease; however, a
separate analysis of only those patients with previously
untreated stage 3 disease showed similar rates of grade 3
toxicity (dermatitis 13.3%, esophagitis 6.7%, pneumonitis
3.3%) and no grade 4-5 toxicity.26 Moreover, our analysis
of toxicity according to GTV revealed that most toxicities
were independent of tumor size within the groups and that
the rate of pneumonitis was lower in the proton group
regardless of tumor size (Table 3) and disease stage (Table
4). Despite these acknowledged shortcomings, it seemed
important nevertheless to have clinical data on the potential toxicity of proton therapy before proceeding to a
randomized trial, particularly one involving a higher total
radiation dose. Some strengths that may warrant such
comparisons include the consistency of normal-tissue dose
constraints over the 3 treatment periods (2001-2003 for
3D-CRT, 2003-2005 for IMRT, and 2006-2008 for proton therapy). These dose constraints were derived from
those used by the RTOG, of which MD Anderson Cancer
Center has been a participating member for more than 2
decades. Moreover, tumor motion has been accounted for
in the same way since 2004; specifically, 4-dimensional
CT scanning is used during treatment simulation and
planning to develop individualized GTVs and clinical target volumes.
This promising early experience with concurrent
chemotherapy and proton therapy has led us to design a
prospective randomized comparative trial of proton therapy versus IMRT, both with concurrent chemotherapy,
for stage 2/3 NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT00495040). In that trial, patients are randomly
assigned to receive IMRTþchemotherapy or proton
beam therapyþchemotherapy. Both arms require that the
GTV be treated to the same total dose [74 Gy of IMRT;
74 Gy(RBE) of proton therapy] in the same fractionation
[2 Gy or 2 Gy(RBE) per fraction]. Primary endpoints are
local tumor control and severe (grade 3) treatmentrelated pneumonitis. This trial, a joint effort between
Massachusetts General Hospital and MD Anderson Cancer Center, is supported in part by a grant from the
National Cancer Institute (P01CA021239).
