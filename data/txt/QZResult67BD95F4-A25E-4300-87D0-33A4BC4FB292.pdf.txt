Abstract
The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is overexpressed and
catalytically activated in a number of human cancers, but recent studies have actually suggested that it may
function as a tumor suppressor and metastasis inhibitor in vivo. In breast cancer, SIRT1 stabilization has been
suggested to contribute to the oncogenic potential of the estrogen receptor a (ERa), but SIRT1 activity has also
been associated with ERa deacetylation and inactivation. In this study, we show that SIRT1 is critical for estrogen
to promote breast cancer. ERa physically interacted and functionally cooperated with SIRT1 in breast cancer
cells. ERa also bound to the promoter for SIRT1 and increased its transcription. SIRT1 expression induced by ERa
was sufﬁcient to activate antioxidant and prosurvival genes in breast cancer cells, such as catalase and glutathione
peroxidase, and to inactivate tumor suppressor genes such as cyclin G2 (CCNG2) and p53. Moreover, SIRT1
inactivation eliminated estrogen/ERa-induced cell growth and tumor development, triggering apoptosis. Taken
together, these results indicated that SIRT1 is required for estrogen-induced breast cancer growth. Our ﬁndings
imply that the combination of SIRT1 inhibitors and antiestrogen compounds may offer more effective treatment
strategies for breast cancer. Cancer Res; 17(21); 6654–64. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is a NADþ-dependent
histone deacetylase, which is implicated in multiple biologic
processes in several organisms (1, 2). All 7 members of the
sirtuin family (SIRT1–7) catalyze either protein deacetylation
or ADP-ribosylation. SIRT1 has protein deacetylase activity,
but no ADP-ribosyl transferase activity. SIRT1 targets many
transcription factors, such as p53, FOXO, E2F1, NF-kB, PGC-1a,
LXR, and MyoD (3, 4). Previous studies have shown that SIRT1
is overexpressed and/or catalytically activated in varieties of
human cancers and that SIRT1 overexpression blocks apoptosis and senescence, and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis (5–8). Inhibition of SIRT1 induces growth arrest and
apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells (9, 10). Furthermore, p53 is
a target for SIRT1; SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53 resulting

in its inactivation (11). In turn, activated p53 downregulates
SIRT1 translation via miR-34a (12). p53-null mice have
increased levels of SIRT1 and several p53-null tumor cell lines
show SIRT1 overexpression (13). These studies clearly show
that SIRT1 functions as an oncogene. However, recent studies
have suggested that SIRT1 may function as a tumor suppressor.
SIRT1 suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis and colon cancer
growth in a b-catenin–driven mouse model of colon cancer
(14). Sirt1/ mice show impaired DNA damage response,
evidenced by genomic instability and tumorigenesis, and
activation of SIRT1 protects against mutant BRCA1-associated
breast cancer (15).
Estrogen (E2) inﬂuences many physiologic processes in
mammals (16, 17). E2/ERa signaling plays an important role
in the regulation of mammary gland development and function, and also contributes to the onset and progression of
breast cancer. More than 70% of human breast cancers express
ERa, and elevated levels of ERa in benign breast epithelium
correlate with increased risk of breast cancer (18). In addition,
studies have shown a positive correlation between ERa expression and age-dependent increase in cancer incidence and
metastasis (19, 20).
SIRT1 is a histone deacetylase; it deacetylates several histone
and nonhistone proteins and thereby it inactivates tumor
suppressor genes and other target proteins. ERa is one of the
several targets of SIRT1. p300 acetylates ERa and the acetylation is reversed by SIRT1 (21). However, recent studies have
shown that inhibition of SIRT1 suppresses ERa expression
(22). Mammary gland-speciﬁc Sirt1 deletion interferes with

Promotion of Breast Cancer by E2-ERa Occurs through SIRT1

E2-stimulated growth signaling in normal and malignant
mammary epithelial cells (23). E2 prevents age-related bone
loss by inducing SIRT1 expression in the bone marrow (24). In
addition, E2 recruits ERa and SIRT1 at the NQO1 (an NRF2dependent detoxifying enzyme) promoter to inhibit transcription (25). Because ERa and SIRT1 cooperate in the development of mammary tumorigenesis, a clear understanding of the
interaction at the molecular level could potentially open up
new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, plasmids, and transfection
The human normal mammary epithelial cell HMEC was
obtained from the Lonza, Walkersville, MD whereas the
other 2 human normal mammary epithelial cell lines,
MCF10A and MCF12A, were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). HBL100, also a human normal
mammary epithelial cell line, was kindly provided by Dr. S.
Sukumar, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. ERpositive human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D,
ZR75.1, BT474, BT483, MDA-MB361, MDA-MB415) and the
ER-negative human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231,
MDA-MB453, MDA-MB468, and HCC1937) were obtained
from ATCC. The HMEC and MCF10A cells were grown in
MEGM complete medium and MCF12A cells was grown in
Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium
with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/mL human epidermal growth
factor (EGF), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/mL bovine
insulin and 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone. HBL100 cells was
grown in McCoy 5A with 10% FBS. MCF7 and BT20 cells
were grown in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. T47D, ZR75.1,
BT474, BT485, and HCC1937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640
medium with 10% FBS. MDA-MB-231, -361, and MDA-MB468 cells were grown in Leibovit's L-15 medium with 10%
FBS. MDA-MB415 cells was grown in Leibovit's L-15 medium
with 15% FBS and 0.01 mg/mL insulin.

Details are given in Supplementary Information.
Immunoprecipitation experiments
Immunoprecipitation (IP) was accomplished with the Universal Magnetic Co-IP kit. HMEC, MCF10A, MCF7, ZR75.1,
MB231, and MB453 cells' extracts were ﬁrst incubated with
protein magnetic beads. The cleared supernatants were incubated either with SIRT1-speciﬁc antibody or with ERa-speciﬁc
antibody overnight before addition of protein A/G agarose
beads. Normal rabbit IgG was used as control. After washing,
immunoprecipitated materials were eluted and immunoblotted with human anti-SIRT1 and anti-ERa antibodies. For
assessment of ERa acetylation, nuclear extracts were used for
IP with an antibody speciﬁc for acetylated lysine, and the
immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblotting with an
ERa-speciﬁc antibody.
Immunoﬂuorescence. Details are given in Supplementary

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
ZR75.1 cells was transfected with expression constructs of
ER family members or SIRT1-7. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out using a ChIP assay kit
(Millipore) using human SIRT1, ERa, and mouse IgG antibodies. After ChIP, genomic DNA present in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by PCR using the promoter-speciﬁc
primers (Supplementary Table S1)
Immunoblot analysis
For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates were prepared by
sonication of cells in cell-lysis buffer with protease inhibitors.
Protein samples were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels and
transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman
GmbH). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and
exposed to primary antibody at 4 C overnight followed by
treatment with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 hour, and
developed by Enhanced Chemiluminescence SuperSignal
Western System.
Reverse transcriptase PCR
SIRT1, ERa, p53, c-Myc, cyclin G2, cyclin G1, survivin and
BMP7 mRNA expressions were determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNA, isolated
from ZR75.1-pLKO.1 and ZR75.1-SIRT1shRNA cells, was
reverse transcribed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied
Biosystems). PCR was done on Veriti thermocycler (Applied
Biosystems) using the human-speciﬁc primers (Supplementary Table S2). Representative images of triplicate experiments
are shown.
SIRT1expression in kidney, lung, liver, heart, and colon was
analyzed by RT-PCR in male and female mice (C57BL/6) at
different ages (3, 6, and 9 months). We used 3 animals in each
age group and SIRT1 expression was quantiﬁed by
densitometry.
Lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase, and
superoxide dismutase assays
Commercial kits were used to assay the lipid peroxidation
product malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase
(Gpx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities as per the
manufacturer's instructions. Details are given in Supplementary information.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were ﬁxed in 50% ethanol, treated with 0.1% sodium
citrate, 1 mg/mL RNase A, and 50 mg/mL propidium iodide,
and subjected to ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS,
Becton Dickinson) analysis.
Colony formation assay
ZR75.1-pLKO.1 and ZR75.1-SIRT1shRNA cells were seeded
in 6-well plates (10,000 cells/well) and grown in E2-free medium. After 24 hours, cells were exposed to 10 nmol/L 17bestradiol for 2 weeks, changing the medium every 3 days. Cells
were washed with PBS and ﬁxed in 100% methanol for 30
minutes followed by staining with KaryoMax Giemsa stain for 1
hour. The wells were washed with water and dried overnight at

N NaOH for 5 minutes and the absorbance of the released dye
was measured at 630 nm.

Results
Mouse xenograft studies
Female athymic nude mice (6- to 8-week old) were purchased
from Taconic). Animals were housed in a pathogen-free isolation facility with a light/dark cycle of 12/12 hours and fed with
rodent chow and water ad libitum. We included 6 mice in each
group. Seven days before tumor induction, mice were anesthetized and 3-mm pellets containing 17b-estradiol, 0.18 mg/21-day
release (Innovative Research of America), was implanted subcutaneously in the animal's back. The pellets provided a continuous release of E2 at serum concentrations of 150 to 250
pmol/L, which is in the range of physiologic levels seen in mice
during the estrous cycle. One week after surgery, ZR75.1-pLKO.1
and 2 clones of ZR75.1-SIRT1shRNA cells (1  107 cells in 100 mL
PBS) were injected subcutaneously in the mammary fat pad.
Tumor volume was quantiﬁed by measuring the length and
width of the tumor every 7 days for 4 weeks using a caliper.
Collection of tissue samples from mouse
Tissues (kidney, lung, liver, heart, and colon) were harvested
from 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old male and female mice as per the
Medical College of Georgia IACUC approved protocols. Tissue
samples were immediately processed for the isolation RNA and
protein samples.
Collection of ER-positive and ER-negative mammary
tissues
The primary breast cancer specimens and corresponding
normal control specimens, adjacent to the tumor, were
obtained from the Medical College of Georgia Tumor Bank,
which is operated jointly by the MCG Cancer Center and the
Department of Pathology. The Tumor Bank has the approval
from the Institutional Review Board and Human Assurance
Committee for the collection of the tissues. The Tumor Bank
has determined the tumor grade and the molecular signature
of each of the cancer specimens in terms of expression of ER
and progesterone receptor (PR) and also whether or not the
tumor overexpresses HER2. We obtained 12 specimens and the
corresponding normal controls from the Tumor Bank. In
addition, we had 4 specimens from a commercial source. RNA
was extracted from 12 ER-positive and 4 ER-negative normal
and breast cancer tissues using the TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen).
Institutional compliance
The animal experiments reported in this study were
approved by the Medical College of Georgia IACUC and Biosafety Committees. Similarly, human breast cancer tissue and
the surrounding normal tissues were obtained from the Medical College of Georgia tumor bank as per the approval of the
Institutional Review Board and Human Assurance Committee.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was done using 1-way ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni multiple comparison test. The software used was

Functional cooperation between E2/ERa and SIRT1
To understand the functional association between E2/ERa
and SIRT1 in breast cancer, ﬁrst we compared the expression
levels of ERa and SIRT1 in ER-positive and ER-negative normal
and breast tumor tissues as well as in nonmalignant and
malignant mammary cell lines. We found a signiﬁcant positive
correlation between ERa and SIRT1 expressions (Fig. 1A, B,
and C). ERa-positive tumors and cancer cell lines expressed
high levels of SIRT1 than ERa-negative tumors and cancer cell
lines. Similarly, both ERa and SIRT1 proteins are overexpressed in breast tumor tissues compared with normal mammary tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1). To conﬁrm this positive
association further, we treated ZR75.1 cells with E2 in the
presence and absence of antiestrogens and monitored the
expression levels of SIRT1. E2 signiﬁcantly induced SIRT1
expression, and the effect was markedly blunted in the presence of antiestrogens (Fig. 1D). Similarly, when ZR75.1 cells
were passaged several times in estrogen-free culture medium,
ERa disappeared in these cells as did SIRT1 at passage numbers greater than 10 (Fig. 1E). These data showed that ligandoccupied ERa induces SIRT1 expression in mammary epithelial cells. This was supported further by the ﬁndings that SIRT1
levels were higher in various tissues in female mice than in
male mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). SIRT1 expression also
correlated positively with E2 in various stages of mammary
gland development (data not shown). All these results suggest
that E2 plays a prominent role in regulation of SIRT1
expression.
ERa binds to SIRT1 promoter and forms a complex in
human breast cancer cells
Unequivocal evidence for the induction of SIRT1 expression by E2/ERa came from the analysis of SIRT1 promoter
activity. Analysis of the human SIRT1 promoter sequence
revealed the presence of 5 putative ERa binding sequences
in the upstream regulatory region (Fig. 2A). We cloned the
2.2 kb human SIRT1 promoter and subcloned it into pEGFP
and luciferase (Luc) reporter vectors. These constructs were
used for transfection into ERa-positive ZR75.1 cells. E2
treatment induced the SIRT1 promoter-speciﬁc EGFP ﬂuorescence (Fig. 2B) and SIRT1 promoter-speciﬁc luciferase
activity (Fig. 2C). Estrogen-induced EGFP ﬂuorescence and
luciferase activity were markedly blunted in the presence of
antiestrogens (Fig. 2B and C). These experiments were
complemented with ChIP assay. We expressed ER (ERa and
ERb) and ERR (ERRa, ERRb, and ERRg ) family members in
ZR75.1 cells, done immunoprecipitation with antibodies
speciﬁc for these proteins, and examined the SIRT1 promoter in the immune complex by PCR. These studies showed
that both ERa and ERRa interact with SIRT1 promoter and
form a complex (Fig. 2D). These studies clearly show the
transcriptional regulation of SIRT1 by E2 in mammary
epithelial cells.

several passages in regular and E2-free medium.

Interaction of SIRT1 with ERa
Then, we wanted to test whether ERa and SIRT1 physically interact and functionally colocalize with each other in
mammary epithelial cells. We conducted a series of coimmunoprecipitation assays using ERa-positive and ERa-negative cell lines. The interaction between SIRT1 and ERa was
clearly evident in MCF7 and ZR75.1 cells that express both
proteins (Fig. 3A). In these cells, both SIRT1 and ERa were
colocalized in the nucleus (Fig. 3B). This interaction and
nuclear colocalization was also conﬁrmed in ERa-negative
cells (MCF10A and MB231) following ectopic expression of
ERa (Fig. 3C and D). There are 2 estrogen receptors, ERa and
ERb, and 3 estrogen receptor-related proteins, ERRa, ERRb,
and ERRg ; all these proteins share signiﬁcant sequence
homology (26). Except ERb, all other members are associated with breast cancer initiation and progression (27).
Therefore, we examined the interaction of SIRT1 with both
ERs and ERRs in ZR75.1 cells that endogenously express all
these proteins. These studies showed that SIRT1 interacts
not only with ERa but also with ERRa (Supplementary Fig.
S3A and B). This was further conﬁrmed in MCF7 cells and in
2 ER-negative human mammary epithelial cell lines, HMEC
and HBL100 (data not shown). To test whether ERa specifically interacts with SIRT1 or also with other sirtuins,
we expressed Flag-tagged SIRT1-7 in ZR75.1 cells, and
examined the presence of ERa in immunoprecipitates with

www.aacrjournals.org

an anti-Flag antibody. The interaction was evident only with
SIRT1 (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
ERa ligands and catalytically active SIRT1 are required
for the interaction between ERa and SIRT1
In the classical mechanism, E2 binds to ERa and the resultant
complex interacts with the estrogen-response elements in E2
target genes, consequently promoting their transcription. To
examine whether the interaction between ERa and SIRT1
requires E2 and whether functional disruption of E2/ERa
complex with antiestrogens affects the interaction, we cultured
ZR75.1 cells in E2-free medium and then treated the cells with E2
and antiestrogens. IP experiments using these cell lysates
showed that SIRT1-ERa interaction requires E2 and that functional disruption of E2/ERa complex dramatically reduces the
interaction (Fig. 4A). Similarly, inhibition of the catalytic activity
of SIRT1 with SIRT1 inhibitors also disrupted the interaction
(Fig. 4A). In contrast, inhibition of type I and type II histone
deacetylase (HDAC) did not affect the interaction between
ERa and SIRT1. This suggests that active ERa and catalytically
active SIRT1 are required for the interaction. Furthermore, the
requirement of a catalytically active SIRT1 suggests that
the interaction between ERa and SIRT1 may be regulated by
SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of ERa. Therefore, we examined
the acetylation status of ERa in the presence (SIRT1 overexpression) and absence (SIRT1 inhibitors) of SIRT1. Neither

cells were transfected with both ER

ERRb, and ERRg) family members
and ChIP assays were carried out
using antibodies speciﬁc for these
proteins. Genomic DNA present in
the immunoprecipitates was
examined using the SIRT1
promoter-speciﬁc primers by PCR.

SIRT1 overexpression nor inhibition inﬂuenced the acetylation
status of ERa (Fig. 4B), showing that SIRT1 is not involved in the
deacetylation of ERa. To conﬁrm this observation further, we
used SIRT1shRNA in ZR75.1 cells (ERa-positive cells with
endogenous SIRT1) and MDA-MB453 (ERa-negative cells with
endogenous SIRT1) and monitored the protein expression and
acetylation status of ERa (Fig. 4C, data not shown). Silencing of
SIRT1 did not change either the expression or the acetylation
status of ERa. As a positive control, we monitored the acetylation of p53, a known target for SIRT1. As expected, silencing of
SIRT1 increased p53 acetylation (Fig. 4D). A recent study has
shown that inhibition of SIRT1 suppresses ERa expression in
breast cancer cells, suggesting that SIRT1 might be involved in
the regulation of ERa expression (22). To conﬁrm these observations, we treated ERa-positive breast cancer cells with SIRT1
inhibitors and analyzed ERa expression. Treatment of ERapositive breast cancer cells with relatively high concentrations of
sirtinol decreased ERa expression, and this process was accompanied with an increase in apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and C). In contrast, another SIRT1 inhibitor, nicotinamide,
neither affected ERa expression nor induced apoptosis in these
3 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4B and D). These results suggest
that sirtinol-associated ERa downregulation may not be directly
related to SIRT1 inhibition.
SIRT1 is required for activation of antioxidant enzymes
by E2-ERa in breast cancer cells
All the above results show that E2/ERa induces the
transcriptional activation of SIRT1 and stabilizes SIRT1

expression by protein–protein interaction and that functional disruption of E2/ERa reduces SIRT1 expression. Thus,
we wanted to ﬁnd out the functional consequences of E2/
ERa and SIRT1 interaction in breast cancer. It is known that
E2 prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and
thus protects cells from DNA damage. A well-known example of E2-associated protection against ROS formation is
that mitochondria from females produce approximately half
the amount of ROS compared with males, and females
express higher levels of antioxidative enzymes, especially
Mn-SOD and Gpx, than males (28). Thus, females have a
natural protection against ROS-induced cell damage. E2 also
protects tumor cells from ROS-induced cell death by activating these enzymes. Furthermore, recent studies have
shown that overexpression of SIRT1 increases the transcription of SOD in human hepatoma cancer cell lines (29). This
suggests that both E2/ERa and SIRT1 upregulate antioxidant enzymes to promote cell survival. Therefore, we examined the role of SIRT1 in the activation of the antioxidant
machinery by E2. First, we compared the extent of DNA
damage, with or without UV radiation, in control (pLKO.1)
and SIRT1-knockdown (SIRT1 shRNA) ZR75.1 cells in the
presence and absence of E2. E2 prevented DNA damage in
control cells to a signiﬁcant extent, but did not do so in
SIRT1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5A). The E2-mediated cellular
defense was also reﬂected in the extent of cellular apoptosis
(Fig. 5B), production of MDA (a surrogate marker for
ROS; Fig. 5C), and the expression and activities of the
antioxidant enzymes SOD and Gpx (Fig. 5D, E, and F); but

represses its transcription and thus it interferes with p53mediated cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (30). SIRT1 also binds

and deacetylates p53 and inactivates its function. Thus, p53 is a
common target for both ERa and SIRT1; therefore, we determined whether SIRT1 is required for the inactivation of p53 by
E2/ERa complex. We ﬁrst monitored the transcriptional activity of E2/ERa by examining the expression levels of various E2/
ERa target genes in control (pLKO.1) and in SIRT1 knockdown
(shRNA) cell lines. The induction of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and
BMP7 by E2/ERa was independent of SIRT1, but the downregulation of p53 and cyclin G2, and the induction of survivin
by E2/ERa was dependent on SIRT1 (Fig. 6A). Because E2
treatment signiﬁcantly reduced p53 mRNA expression in the
pLKO.1 stable cell line and SIRT1 knockdown abolished that
effect and thus, we wanted to examine the role E2 and SIRT1 in
the transcriptional regulation of p53 at the promoter level.
Genomic database analysis of p53 promoter suggested that it
has 10 consensus binding sites for ERa (Supplementary Fig.
S5A). We transfected ZR75.1-pLKO.1 and ZR75.1-SIRT1shRNA

cells with 2.4 kb and 356-bp p53 promoter-luciferase reporter
plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. S. Sukumar, Johns Hopkins
University) and treated the cells with E2 for 24 hours. We
observed that E2 treatment signiﬁcantly suppressed the p53promoter (2.4 kb)-dependent reporter activity only in ZR75.1pLKO.1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). E2 treatment did not
affect the shorter p53-promoter (356-bp) in these cells. Interestingly, SIRT1 knockdown itself transactivated the p53-promoter several-fold, but E2 treatment did not affect the p53promoter-dependent reporter activity in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These results suggest that SIRT1 is required
for the transcriptional suppression of p53 by E2 in breast
cancer cells.
The E2-induced p53 suppression in ZR75.1-pLKO.1 cells was
not observed at the protein level even though the promoter
activity showed suppression (Fig. 6B). This suggests that E2mediated p53 inactivation is associated with posttranslational

Promotion of Breast Cancer by E2-ERa Occurs through SIRT1

suppression of p53 by E2/ERa. A,
the expression levels of E2 target
genes (c-Myc, cyclin D1, BMP7,
survivin, p53, and cyclin G2) were
analyzed by RT-PCR and Western
blot in control and SIRT1

without E2 treatment. The red
highlights identify the genes whose
regulation by E2 is mediated
through SIRT1. B, the acetylation

modiﬁcation and that SIRT1 might play role in this event.
Therefore, we examined the role of SIRT1 in the acetylation of
p53 and cyclin G2. In control cells, E2 caused deacetylation of
p53 and cyclin G2, but this effect was abolished in SIRT1
knockdown cells (Fig. 6B). ChIP assays with ZR75.1 cells
transfected with ER and ERR family members showed that
immunoprecipitates with anti-SIRT1 antibody contained the
promoters of p53 and cyclin G2 only in cells expressing ERa
and ERRa (Fig. 6C). Similarly, ChIP assays with cells transfected with SIRT1-7 showed that immunoprecipitates with
anti-ERa antibody contained the promoters of p53 and cyclin
G2 only in cells expressing SIRT1. This was not the case for the
other E2/ERa target genes c-Myc, cyclin D1, survivin, and
BMP7. These results suggest that E2 recruits ERa and SIRT1
to suppress p53 and cyclin G2 expression in ER-positive breast
cancer cells.
Loss of SIRT1 is associated with elimination of E2induced cell survival and mammary tumorigenesis
Because E2 promotes the development and progression of
many hormone-dependent cancers, especially breast cancer,
and SIRT1 also promotes several human malignancies by
deacetylating tumor suppressor genes, we wanted to test
whether SIRT1 plays a role in E2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. To determine the role of SIRT1 in E2-mediated
promotion of cell survival and breast cancer growth, we ﬁrst
monitored the ability of E2 to promote colony formation in
vitro in control cells and SIRT1 knockdown cells. E2 was able to
induce colony formation only in control cells but not in SIRT1-

depleted cells (Fig. 7A). This phenomenon was conﬁrmed in
vivo in mouse xenografts. Xenografts with control ZR75.1 cells
grew in a time-dependent manner, and the growth was promoted by E2 (Fig. 7B). In contrast, SIRT1-depleted ZR75.1 cells
failed to grow in xenografts with or without E2 (Fig. 7B),
showing that SIRT1 is absolutely required for the promotion
of tumor growth by E2. To conﬁrm the functional cooperation
between ERa and SIRT1 in the promotion of the growth of
xenografted breast cancer cells, we treated the 3 different
human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, and ZR75.1) with
tamoxifen (an antiestrogen) and sirtinol and nicotinamide
(SIRT1 inhibitors) alone or in combination. The combination
treatment produced a greater magnitude of apoptosis in these
cells than the individual treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6).
This was true even for the tamoxifen-resistant cell line MCF7TAM(R; Supplementary Fig. S7A). Interestingly, the MCF7TAM(R) cells had higher levels of SIRT1 expression than the
parent MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). We conﬁrmed
this further with SIRT1 knockdown in ZR75.1 cells where
antiestrogens caused more apoptosis in SIRT1 knockdown
cells than in control cells (Fig. 7C). On the basis of these
results, we propose a model for the interaction of ERa and
SIRT1 and a molecular mechanism involved in the promotion
of breast cancer by the ERa-SIRT1 complex (Fig. 7D).

Figure 7. Loss of SIRT1 is associated with elimination of E2-induced cell survival and mammary tumorigenesis. A, control and SIRT1 knockdown ZR75.1 cells
were treated with or without E2 for 2 weeks and the resulting colonies were quantiﬁed with Giemsa staining. B, seven days before tumor induction, female
athymic nude mice (6 animals per group; 3 groups) were anesthetized and 3-mm pellets containing E2, 0.18 mg/21-day release, were implanted
subcutaneously in the animal's back. Another 18 animals were used as a control, without E2 treatment. One week after pellet implantation, ZR75.1-pLKO.1

and ZR75.1-SIRT1shRNA (2 independent shRNA clones shRNA#2 and shRNA#3) cells (1  10 cells in 100 mL PBS) were injected subcutaneously
in the mammary fat pad of all animals. Tumor volume was used as a measure of tumor growth at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after cell injections. We compared the
tumor volume of pLKO.1 and SIRT1shRNA-induced tumor in the presence and absence of E2 and the statistical signiﬁcance was calculated as    , P < 0.001;

48 hours. Apoptotic cell death was analyzed by FACS. We compared the apoptotic cell death in control pLKO.1 and SIRT1shRNA cells treated with E2,

cancers, including breast cancer, has been well established. In
the absence of estrogen, ERa is inactivated by the binding of a
HSP90 within the nucleus. Upon estrogen binding, the receptor
undergoes conformational change so that HSP90 is released,
enabling ERa to activate gene transcription. ERa functions as a
transcriptional activator by binding to the estrogen response
element in the target gene promoter (16, 17). ERa also functions as a transcription repressor upon binding to certain
antagonists, such as tamoxifen, and to various corepressors
and histone deacetylases (31). Thus, depending on the binding
partner, ERa functions as either transcriptional activator or
repressor of the target gene. Our ﬁndings show for the ﬁrst time
that SIRT1 is the binding partner of ERa in mammary epithelial
cells and that the ERa-SIRT1 complex functions as a transcriptional activator of SOD and Gpx and as a transcriptional
repressor of p53 and cyclin G2. In addition to its role as a
binding partner of SIRT1, ERa also regulates the expression of
SIRT1 through transcription and by protein–protein interaction. Our results also suggest that SIRT1 could be a downstream target of E2 in mammary epithelium.
In our study, we found a direct physical interaction between
ERa and SIRT1. This interaction requires a catalytically active
SIRT1. However, SIRT1 does not affect the acetylation status of
ERa. Furthermore, knockdown of SIRT1 in ER-negative breast

cancer cells is not able reactivate ERa expression. However,
HDAC1 and HDAC3 deacetylate ERa and knockdown of these
HDACs reactivates ERa expression (Supplementary Fig. S8).
This suggests that SIRT1 does not play a role in deacetylation of
ERa. E2/ERa induces SIRT1 expression by directly binding to
SIRT1 promoter. We conclude that E2/ERa signaling activates
SIRT1 and that SIRT1 is the molecular transducer of E2induced oncogenic signaling in mammary epithelial cells.
Furthermore, we also found a direct interaction between SIRT1
and ERRa in human breast cancer, and ER-negative breast
cancer cells still have high expression of SIRT1 compared with
normal mammary epithelial cells. In addition, we found higher
levels of ERRa expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells
than in normal and ER-positive breast cancer cells (unpublished data). These observations suggest that SIRT1 and ERRa
might play a crucial role in regulation of survival signaling in
ER-negative breast cancer. The ﬁndings in the literature that
ERRa is critical for the growth of ER-negative breast cancer
and that SIRT1 directly interacts with ERRa and enhances its
transcriptional function (32, 33) support our data and
conclusions.
E2 increases cell survival and oncogenic transformation via
activation of antioxidative enzymes, MAPK, PI3K and telomerase, and inhibition of p53. Likewise, SIRT1 also increases cell

Promotion of Breast Cancer by E2-ERa Occurs through SIRT1

survival and extents cellular longevity by preventing ROS
formation, regulating MAPK and inhibiting p53 function. Our
results show that E2 efﬁciently protects breast cancer cells
from oxidative and radiation-induced DNA damage by inducing SOD and Gpx activity. However, E2-associated cellular
protection and antioxidant enzyme induction obligatorily
depends on functional SIRT1. Thus, both E2/ERa and SIRT1
target a common molecular signaling pathway to protect cells
from oxidative and radiation-induced DNA damage. Our
results show that ERa and SIRT1 interact with each other
and promote cell survival and tumor growth in breast cancer
cells.
Our studies also show that ERa binds to p53 promoter and
suppresses its expression and that the process is obligatorily
dependent on SIRT1. Thus, ERa-SIRT1 complex functions as a
suppressor of p53 gene in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, E2
treatment results in deacetylation of p53, and SIRT1 knockdown abolishes this effect, suggesting that SIRT1 is necessary
for the ability of ERa to suppress p53 signaling in breast cancer.
Similarly, E2/ERa directly binds to cyclin G2 promoter and
suppresses its expression (34). Our studies show for the ﬁrst
time that SIRT1 is needed for this effect.
E2/ERa complex is linked to the development and promotion of breast cancer. There is also strong evidence that SIRT1
is involved in oncogenic signaling in mammary epithelial cells.
First, SIRT1 knockout mice exhibit p53 hyperacetylation and
increased radiation-induced apoptosis consistent with SIRT1
inhibition of p53 function (35). This raises the possibility
that SIRT1 can facilitate tumor growth by antagonizing the
p53 function. Second, DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer) inhibits
SIRT1 in human mammary epithelial cells, and repression of
SIRT1 by DBC1 hyperacetylates and activates p53 (6, 36). Third,
HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer) binds to SIRT1 promoter
and represses its transcription; at the same time, HIC1 promotes p53 expression (7). Because HIC1 is silenced in
many types of tumors, including breast cancer, this results in

upregulation of SIRT1, thus promoting tumorigenesis. Furthermore, upregulation of SIRT1 has been observed in various
cancers (5–8). All these ﬁndings show that SIRT1 is a tumor
promoter. Our studies show unequivocally that SIRT1 plays a
critical role as a tumor promoter in ER-positive breast cancer.
In normal cells, the ERa-SIRT1 complex mediates several
beneﬁcial functions such as the protection of the cells from
the ROS-induced DNA damage, maintainance of genomic
integrity and telomerase function, and inactivation of apoptotic signaling. The same functions promote the survival and
growth of tumor cells. Furthermore, SIRT1 also seems to play a
crucial role in breast cancer cells in the development of
resistance to antiestrogen therapy. These ﬁndings suggest that
appropriate combination therapies targeting both ERa and
SIRT1 could offer a novel and effective strategy for treatment of
breast cancer.
