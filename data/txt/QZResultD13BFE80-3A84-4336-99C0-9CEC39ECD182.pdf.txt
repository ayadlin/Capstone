BACKGROUND: Pandemic influenza A (hereafter 2009/H1N1) caused significant morbidity and mortality during the 2009 pandemia.
Patients with chronic medical conditions and immunosuppressive diseases had a greater risk of complications. However, data regarding the characteristics and outcome of 2009/H1N1 infection in patients with solid tumors are nonexistent. Herein, the authors describe
a series of influenza 2009/H1N1 in patients with solid malignancies at 3 major cancer hospitals worldwide. METHODS: The authors
retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with solid organ malignancies and 2009/H1N1 from The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas; the Mexican National Cancer Institute, Federal District of Mexico; and King Hussein Cancer
Center in Amman, Jordan from the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemia. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, and outcome
were extracted. RESULTS: In total, 115 cases were identified during the pandemic influenza among the 3 institutions. High rates of
hospitalization (50%), pneumonia (23%), and death (9.5%) were reported. Patients who developed pneumonia and those who died
were moderately to severely immunocompromised (P ¼ .001 and P ¼ .006, respectively). A multivariate competing risk analysis
demonstrated that a delay >48 hours in starting antiviral therapy was associated significantly with an increased risk of developing
pneumonia (P ¼ .013). CONCLUSIONS: The 2009/H1N1 pandemic caused severe illness in immunocompromised patients with
cancer who had solid tumors, and heavily immunosuppressed patients were at greater risk of developing pneumonia and
death. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is crucial in this patient population to decrease morbidity and probably mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Pandemic influenza A 2009/H1N1 was first reported causing illnesses in Mexico in March 2009. The virus then rapidly
spread to the United States and worldwide. On April 17, 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reported the first 2 cases of this infection in 2 children in California.1 Two months later, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared it a global pandemic, and this pandemic concluded on June 23, 2010. The final H1N1 CDC statistics
estimate that, between April 2009 and April 10, 2010, there were between 43 million and 89 million cases of 2009/H1N1
and between 195,000 and 403,000 2009/H1N1-related hospitalizations.2 Greater than half of patients who were admitted to the hospital with 2009/H1N1 infection were likely to have at least 1 underlying medical condition.3-5
Patients with chronic conditions, patients with immunosuppressant diseases like human immunodeficiency virus
and cancer, transplantation recipients (solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell), pregnant women, obese individuals, and
children all are reportedly at greater risk of complications.6-11 Data regarding the characteristics and outcome of 2009/
H1N1 infection in patients with solid tumors are nonexistent. The objective of this report was to describe the results
from a retrospective, multicenter study of the epidemic in cancer patients with solid tumors who presented with acute
respiratory illnesses compatible with influenza infection and were recently infected with influenza A virus (probable and
confirmed 2009/H1N1 virus) at 3 major comprehensive cancer centers worldwide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We searched the microbiology databases for all patients
with solid tumors who had influenza A infection diagnosed during the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemia at 3 major
cancer hospitals worldwide: The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, Tex;
the Mexican National Cancer Institute (Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia [INCan], Mexico Federal District;
and the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC), Amman,
Jordan.
We collected the following data from the electronic
medical records for all patients: demographics (age, sex,
and race), cancer type, comorbidities and concurrent
coinfections, use of immunosuppressive therapy, use of
antiviral prophylaxis, clinical presentation, radiologic
characteristics, treatment, and outcome. All patients were
followed until resolution of all signs and symptoms of
infection or death. The median follow-up for patients
who survived was 136 days (range, 1-472 days).
Definitions

A case of influenza infection was defined as a patient with
cancer who had a solid tumor, was cared for at any of the
3 institutions, and developed an acute respiratory illness
confirmed by a positive viral culture, and/or a positive
direct fluorescence antigen test, and/or a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the influenza virus
during the 2009/H1N1 pandemic. The infection was
classified as community acquired if the onset of symptoms
was before hospitalization, or within the first 2 days after
admission, or as nosocomial if the symptoms developed
anytime after that during hospitalization. Upper respiratory tract infection was defined as the onset of rhinorrhea,
nasal/sinus congestion, otitis media, pharyngitis, or cough
with or without expectoration and was confirmed by positive direct immunofluorescence (DFA), viral culture, or
PCR from nasal wash with a clear chest x-ray or computed
tomography (CT) scan of the chest. Lower respiratory
infection was defined as new or changing pulmonary infiltrates by chest x-ray or CT scans suggestive of viral etiology (ie, interstitial infiltrates or ground-glass opacities)
and a positive DFA, viral culture, or PCR from respiratory
samples, including nasal wash, endotracheal tube aspirate,
sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Clinical outcomes were classified as either complete recovery, progression to pneumonia/lower respiratory infection, or death
within 60 days from the onset of symptoms. Recovery was
defined as the resolution of all clinical manifestations
of influenza infection irrespective of viral shedding.
A concurrent coinfection was considered when another
4628

organism was isolated within 3 days of diagnosis of an
influenza infection.
Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil
count of <500 cells/mL, and severe lymphopenia was
defined as an absolute lymphocyte count of 200 cells/
mL. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI)
(calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the
square of the height in meters [kg/m2]) of 30 kg/m2 in
adults aged 18 years or a BMI percentile of 95 in children between ages 2 years and 18 years. Severe immunodeficiency was defined as the presence of 2 or more of the
following criteria: an absolute leukocyte count <200
cells/mL or an absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/mL,
use of immunosuppressive therapy (cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs, immunomodulators,
radiotherapy, or corticosteroids), all within 2 weeks before
the diagnosis of influenza A infection. Moderate immunodeficiency was defined as the presence of only 1 criterion of severe immunodeficiency or when 2 or more of the
following criteria were present: an a absolute lymphocyte
count between 200 and 1000 cells/mL or an absolute neutrophil count between 500 and 1000 cells/mL within 2
weeks before the diagnosis of influenza A infection and
immunosuppressive therapy (as defined above) within
1 month before the diagnosis of the infection. Mild
immunodeficiency was defined as the presence of only 1
criterion of moderate immunodeficiency. If none of the
criteria listed above were present, then the patient was
considered to have no immunodeficiency. Although these
criteria for immunodeficiency are not validated but are
known as risk factors for different types of infections, we
elected to use them for risk stratification in this patient
population.
Statistical Considerations

Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used for categorical data analysis. Continuous variables were compared by
using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Survival analysis was performed on patients’ pneumonia development and survival
after symptom onset. First, a competing risk analysis with
death as a competing event was performed to assess the cumulative incidence curves of pneumonia development for
the patients who received antiviral treatment within 48
hours of their symptoms onset and those who did not.
The curves also were compared between these 2 groups of
patients. Then, a multiple competing risk analysis was
performed to identify the independent risk factors for
developing pneumonia. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were assessed for the patients who received antiviral
treatment within 48 hours of their symptoms onset and
Cancer

those who did not. A log-rank test was used to compare
the survival of these 2 groups. Then, Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to identify the independent
risk factors for patients’ mortality. All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The institutional review boards
at all 3 institutions approved the study, informed consent
was waived, no patient contact was made, and patient
confidentiality was protected.

Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Cancer Patients With
Pandemic Influenza A (2009/H1N1) Infection (n ¼ 115)

RESULTS
In total, 115 cases were identified during the pandemic
influenza among the 3 institutions (26 at INCan in Mexico, 69 at KHCC in Jordan, and 20 at MDACC in the
United States). Table 1 indicates that the median patient
age was 40 years (age range, 1-79 years). The most common underlying malignancies were breast cancer (24%)
followed by central nervous system malignancies (11%),
sarcoma (8%), and bone cancer (7%). All patients presented with influenza-like symptoms: 90% had fever,
85% had cough, 57% had rhinorrhea or nasal congestion,
37% had a sore throat, 31% had myalgia, and 29% had
dyspnea (Table 2). Fifty-eight patients required hospital
admission, and their median length of stay was 5 days
(range, 1-33 days). Eighty-one patients (70%) received
chemotherapy within 1 month of acquiring the infection,
and 18 patients (16%) were receiving steroids. It is noteworthy that 32 patients (28%) were considered obese.
Table 3 provides a comparison among the patients
at the 3 institutions. Other than ethnicity, there were no
significant differences between them. However, patients
at KHCC in Jordan were less immunocompromised and
had lower mortality.

Sex

Pneumonia

Twenty-seven patients (23%) developed pneumonia,
including 25 on presentation (Table 4). The median age
of these 27 patients was 46 years (age range, 1-77 years).
Compared with patients who had influenza infection limited to the upper respiratory tract, patients who had pneumonia were older (median age, 46 years vs 35 years), were
moderately to severely immunosuppressed (70% vs 27%),
presented significantly later to the hospital after symptom
onset (median, 3 days [range, 1-21 days] vs 2 days [range
1-21 days]; P < .001), and subsequently had a significantly longer time from symptom onset to the initiation
of antiviral therapy (median, 3 days [range, 1-24 days] vs
2 days [range, 1-21 days]; P < .001). Furthermore,
patients who began antiviral therapy more than 48 hours

Treatment

Most patients received a neuraminidase inhibitor, mainly
oseltamivir. Patients who did not receive antiviral therapy
were considered to have mild infection, and all of these
latter patients completely recovered.
A univariate competing risk analysis (Fig. 1) indicated that patients who received treatment within 48 hours
of symptom onset had less risk of developing pneumonia
(P < .001), which was confirmed by a multiple competing risk analysis. A log-rank test (Fig. 2) indicated that
patients had a trend toward increased mortality if therapy
was initiated >48 hours after symptom onset (P ¼ .06).
However, a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
indicated that this factor was not associated independently
with mortality.

diagnosis was the only independent factor associated
with mortality among cancer patients with solid tumors
(P ¼ .006).
DISCUSSION
The 2009/H1N1 pandemic concluded on June 23, 2010.
Although the majority of infected patients recovered
without complications, patients with pre-existing medical
conditions, such as immunosuppressed cancer patients,
usually are included in reports as hospitalized and
critically ill and are believed to be at greater risk of complications.11-13
Several important conclusions can be drawn from
our study, which, to our knowledge, is the first multicenter study to date describing 2009/H1N1 infection in
patients with solid tumors during the pandemic. First,
this virus caused severe illness in immunocompromised
cancer patients with solid tumors, resulting in relatively
high rates of hospitalization (50%), pneumonia (23%),
and death (9.5%). Second, the majority of infected cancer
patients were aged <50 years and were either moderately
or severely immunosuppressed. Finally, a 48-hour delay
in receiving antiviral therapy was associated with an
increased risk of developing pneumonia and a trend
toward greater mortality.
An initial distinctive epidemiologic feature of the
2009/H1N1 pandemic was the shift in the age distribution to a younger population.11,14 One of the first studies
indicated that 60% of the cases occurred in patients aged
<18 years.13 Conversely, age has been identified as a risk
factor for the development of severe disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients.8 In our
study, we observed that 38.2% of the cases occurred in
individuals aged 18 years, only 7% occurred in individuals aged 65 years, and age was not correlated with a
worse prognosis. Although, in general, most patients with
cancer belong to an older population, there was a low rate
of infection in the elderly population, as expected, because
they may have partial immunity from former infections
with H1N1 influenza viruses.13,15,16
Obesity has been reported as a new risk factor for
adverse outcomes after infection with pandemic2009/
H1N1 viruses.11,14 We observed a high percentage of
obese cancer patients with influenza A infection (36%)
and with a trend toward developing pneumonia (P ¼
.08). This finding is surprising, because unintentional
weight loss is a particularly common problem in cancer
patients on active chemotherapy.
Pneumonia is a major complication from influenza
A infection. Among hospitalized patients in Mexico, the
4632

reported rate of pneumonia among patients with 2009/
H1N1 infections was 18%,9 which was similar to the rate
reported for pregnant women with 2009/H1N1 in the
United States.17 Among immunocompromised patients,
rates reportedly are higher in HSCT recipients and solid
organ transplantation (SOT) recipients (range, 32%55%).6,8,18,19 We observed a 23% incidence of pneumonia among our patients with solid tumors.5 The majority
of these cancer patients needed critical care support, and
almost one-third died (30%). Most patients who developed pneumonia were receiving immunosuppressive
therapy at the time of diagnosis, and they sought medical
care later, with a subsequent delay in initiating antiviral
therapy. This latter factor contributed significantly to
morbidity and possibly to mortality.
The CDC estimates that, during the pandemic,
approximately 12,470 2009/H1N1-related deaths
occurred from a total of 61 million cases in the United
States. Only 1670 deaths occurred in individuals aged
>65 years, confirming epidemiologic data indicating that
this infection affects the younger population more frequently and more severely. We observed a high mortality
rate (9.5%) from this infection in patients with solid
tumors, higher than that reported for SOT recipients
(4%) and similar to that reported for HSCT recipients
(between 6% and 16%).6,8,18
Antiviral therapy, mainly neuraminidase inhibitors,
started within 48 hours of illness onset reduces the duration of symptoms and improves outcome for healthy individuals with influenza A.20 Patients with severe 2009/
H1N1 infection who were admitted to an intensive care
unit in Michigan had an estimated median delay of 8 days
(range, 5-12 days) from illness onset to the initiation of
antiviral therapy.13 Risk factors for pneumonia that have
been identified in immunosuppressed populations are a
delay in early initiation of antiviral therapy in HSCT and
SOT recipients6,8 and lymphopenia in HSCT recipients.6
In our patients with solid organ malignancies, we
observed that the degree of immunosuppression and a
delay >48 hours in the start of neuraminidase inhibitors
were associated with progression to pneumonia and a
trend toward increased mortality. These data underscore
the importance of early diagnosis and the institution of
empiric antiviral therapy pending microbiologic confirmation of influenza infection in immunocompromised
patients.
Our study has several limitations. First, because it
was a retrospective, observational study, no control group
was available. Second, some of the cases were not confirmed as secondary to 2009/H1N1 virus by PCR (mainly

cases from MDACC), but the CDC reports that 90% of
the influenza infection cases during the 2009 influenza
season were identified as involving the 2009/H1N1 influenza A virus.9,21,22 Unlike small case series, however, our
study included patients from different geographic locations, giving us a worldwide perspective of the disease in
this population and providing a better basis for the subsequent generalization of our findings.
In summary, during a pandemic, influenza A infection may present as a severe disease in patients with solid
tumors, as it does in other immunocompromised patients
(HSCT recipients and SOT recipients). Heavily immunosuppressed patients are at greater risk of developing
pneumonia with subsequent high mortality. A delay in
the initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with a
greater risk of developing of pneumonia. Early suspicion
and initiation of therapy within 48 hours are crucial in
this patient population to decrease morbidity.
