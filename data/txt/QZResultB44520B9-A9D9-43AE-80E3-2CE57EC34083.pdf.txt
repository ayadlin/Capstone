BACKGROUND: Primary mucinous adenocarcinomas of the ovary are uncommon, and their biological behavior is
uncertain. Retrospective studies have suggested that many mucinous carcinomas initially diagnosed as primary to
the ovary have in fact metastasized from another site. A prospective randomized trial provided an opportunity to
estimate the frequency of mucinous tumors, diagnostic reproducibility, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A phase 3
trial enrolled 4000 women with stage III or IV ovarian carcinoma, treated by surgical staging and debulking, with randomization to one of five chemotherapeutic arms. Slides and pathology reports classified as primary mucinous carcinoma were reviewed independently by three pathologists. Cases were reclassified as primary or metastatic to the
ovary according to two methods. Overall survival (OS) of reclassified groups was compared within the groups and
with that of patients with serous carcinomas. RESULTS: Forty-four cases were classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma
upon review. Using either method, only about one third were interpreted by the three reviewers as primary mucinous
carcinomas. Reproducibility of interpretations among the reviewers was high, with unanimity of opinion in 30
(68%) cases. The median survival (MS) did not differ significantly between the groups interpreted as primary or metastatic, but the OS was significantly less than that for women with serous carcinoma (14 vs 42 months, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Advanced stage mucinous carcinoma of the ovary is very rare and is associated with poor OS. Many
mucinous adenocarcinomas that are diagnosed as primary ovarian neoplasms ap pear to be metastatic to the ovary.

Mucinous Ovarian Carcinoma/Zaino et al

Mucinous tumors of the ovary remain problematic
to the pathologist and treating physician. Unresolved
issues include determination of 1) the minimal criteria for
the distinction of an invasive mucinous carcinoma from a
borderline tumor, 2) the criteria that distinguish metastatic from primary mucinous carcinoma, and 3) the
behavior of mucinous carcinoma.
In 1971, Hart and Norris1 proposed that a mucinous tumor be considered invasive when the depth of
epithelial stratification exceeded three cell layers or in the
presence of stromal invasion, either in the form of
‘‘destructive’’ growth as irregular cords or nests of cells
haphazardly scattered in the stroma or as large sheets of
glands with no intervening stroma. They reported a 59%
survival for patients with mucinous ovarian carcinoma
with a median follow-up of 8 years.
During the past decade, several investigations have
concluded that many cases previously diagnosed as primary mucinous carcinoma were actually metastatic to the
ovary.2,3 Mucinous tumors may arise from a variety of
sites, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract (including the colon, appendix, and pancreas) and less often
stomach and biliary tract, as well as from the endometrium and endocervix.2-16 Immunohistochemistry may be
of some assistance in making these distinctions, but determination of the site of origin for mucinous carcinomas
involving the ovary remains a significant diagnostic
challenge.2,7,11,13,17-22 Consequently, no gold standard
exists to distinguish primary from metastatic mucinous
adenocarcinomas of the ovary. Yemelyanova et al,23 using
modified criteria of Seidman et al3 and Lee and Young,9
independently proposed sets of pathological characteristics that might help pathologists better distinguish
between primary and metastatic mucinous tumors that
involve the ovary.
The behavior of mucinous carcinoma of the ovary
has not been clearly defined, in part due to the diagnostic
problems described previously. When stage is not considered, mucinous carcinomas overall seem to have a better
prognosis than serous carcinomas. For example, Kikkawa
et al24 recently reported a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate
of approximately 75% in a group of 169 women with
mucinous carcinomas of the ovary, and a survival rate of
about 28% for the subset with stage III disease. Chaitin et
al25 reviewed 70 cases of mucinous tumors of the ovary,
and they reported a 7-year OS of 72% for stage I mucinous carcinoma but only 8% for patients of stage II or
higher. The apparently poor survival for advanced stage
Cancer

patients in some studies could reflect the intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumors, a resistance of mucinous carcinoma to agents that are effective for serous carcinoma of
the ovary or the misclassification of mucinous tumors as
primary to that site when they are actually metastatic to
the ovary.
The goals of the current study were: 1) to estimate
the frequency of reclassification of mucinous carcinoma
of the ovary as metastatic mucinous ovarian carcinoma,
using 2 simple gross and microscopic algorithms; 2) to
estimate whether the survival of women with advanced
stage primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary differs significantly from that of women with mucinous carcinoma
metastatic to the ovary based on those classifications; and
3) to determine whether the survival of women with
advanced stage primary mucinous carcinomas treated
with chemotherapy is significantly different from that of
serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
In collaboration with the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup,
the Gynecologic Oncology Group initiated a phase III
clinical trial involving women with newly diagnosed
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
stage III or IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal
carcinoma, with either optimal or suboptimal residual
tumor after primary cytoreductive surgery. The protocol
received local institutional review board approval, and all
patients signed informed consent. The primary endpoints
of the study were OS and progression-free survival. The
protocol was open to patient entry between January 2001
and September 2004. Submission of surgical pathology
reports and slides documenting the primary tumor and
highest stage of disease were required for central pathology review. The Gynecologic Oncology Group enrolled
3435 of the 3698 patients entered in this protocol by
United States institutional members, 54 (1.5%) of whom
were diagnosed as having mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Immunohistochemical stains were not required for entry
as mucinous adenocarcinoma in this protocol. Following
a preliminary review (by R. J. Z.), 10 of these cases had
either insufficient pathological material for the review or
were judged not to be of mucinous histological type.
The surgical pathology report and slides for each of
the 44 cases were independently reviewed by each of the
three pathologists (R. J. Z., S. L., and H. M.) at their
respective institutions without access to any of the clinical
outcome data. Each reviewer performed a separate

555

Original Article

assessment and recording of the following 12 pathological
characteristics for each primary tumor based on examination of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and
accompanying surgical pathology report: 1) maximum
primary ovarian tumor diameter, 2) presence or absence
of bilateral ovarian involvement, 3) surface involvement
of ovary, 4) neoplastic cells in the hilum, 5) a nodular
growth pattern in the ovary, 6) an infiltrative pattern of
invasion, 7) small neoplastic glands or tubules, 8) single
neoplastic cells, 9) signet ring cells, 10) necrotic luminal
debris, 11) an expansile pattern of invasion, and 12) complex papillae. The determination of some characteristics,
such as bilaterality and maximum tumor dimension,
could not be made in a few cases in which the surgical
pathology reports did not clearly indicate the information.
In a few cases, the surgical pathology report also indicated
the results of immunohistochemical staining for various
cytokeratins, but the results of these stains were not used
in the assessment of primary site.
The size and laterality algorithm classifies all bilateral mucinous carcinomas as metastatic, unilateral mucinous carcinomas <13 cm as metastatic, and unilateral
mucinous carcinomas 13 cm as primary.3 Because this
algorithm is based entirely on two pieces of data extracted
from the surgical pathology report, it was performed only
once (by R. J. Z.).
Each of the pathologists separately recorded their
respective interpretations of each case as primary or metastatic, employing a 12 (of the 16 discriminatory) criteria
provided by Lee and Young9 (Table 1). This included 9
criteria that favored a metastasis and 3 criteria that favored
a primary mucinous tumor of the ovary. Admixtures of
features were frequent, and some tumors displayed more
than 1 pattern of invasion (eg, expansile and infiltrative).
Each feature present was recorded in these cases. Because a
mixture of features favoring both primary and metastatic
tumor was often present in an individual case, each
pathologist used personal judgment when applying the
criteria. Each pathologist was provided a copy of each of
the relevant publication for review prior to assessment and
interpretation of the cases.9 The collection of follow-up
data included identification of any subsequent primary
tumors.
The Fisher exact test was used to assess each of the
hypotheses that a specific histological feature is independent of the interpreted origin of cancer conditioned on the
observed marginal frequencies.27 A log-rank procedure
was used to assess the hypothesis that death rates are independent of specific histological features.28

RESULTS
Of the 3435 patients enrolled in an international 5-arm
randomized trial by the Gynecologic Oncology Group,
54 (1.5%) had initial diagnoses of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma. The mean number of slides submitted per
case for review was 6, with a range of 2-35 slides. Upon
review (by reviewer 1), 10 of these cases had either inadequate pathological material (n ¼ 5) or were judged not
to be of mucinous histological type (n ¼ 5), leaving 44
cases for the current study.
Of the 41 cases in which the data were complete,
with the application of the size and laterality algorithm,23
12 (29%) of the tumors were considered primary to the
ovary, whereas 29 (71%) were reclassified as metastatic.
Specifically, 16 tumors (40%) were unilateral, whereas 24
(60%) involved both ovaries (one 12-cm tumor without
laterality specified). There were 16 (39%) tumors <13
cm in maximum diameter, whereas 25 (61%) were 13
cm in diameter. Nine cases had typical histological features of pseudomyxoma peritonei in nonovarian foci of
disease, and all of these cases were interpreted as representing carcinomas of nonovarian origin.
The selected pathological criteria (Table 1) formed
the basis for the 3 pathologists’ individual interpretation
of cases as primary or metastatic.9 The distribution frequency with which each of the 12 potentially

primary or metastatic according to size and laterality algorithm. According to this definition, all tumors <13 cm were

of an expansile growth pattern (88% vs 7%; P < 0.001)
and complex papillae (88% vs 4%; P < 0.001) were each
strongly associated with the retention of classification as a
primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary. The presence
of other features was associated (P < 0.05) with an interpretation of carcinoma metastatic to the ovary. Reviewer
1 judged all cases to be metastatic in the presence of hilar
involvement or a nodular growth pattern, but these features were present in only a minority of patients (11% and
27%, respectively).
Overall, only 16 (36%), 17 (39%), and 18 (41%)
cases were individually judged by the 3 reviewers to be primary to the ovary, whereas 57%-63% were interpreted as
metastatic to the ovary. There was unanimity of opinion
by the reviewers in 30 (68%) cases, with complete agreement on 45% of the total as representing metastatic carcinoma, and 23% of the total as primary mucinous ovarian
carcinoma. The specific features for which the reviewers
had the greatest interpretative concordance were the maximum diameter of the tumor, the presence of bilaterality,
and an infiltrative pattern of invasion (Table 3).
Using either classification system, similar numbers
of cases were judged to be primary to the ovary (between
12 and 18 cases). However, diagnostic concordance was

557

Original Article

observed in only 30 of 41 (73%) cases when cases diagnosed as primary or metastatic using the algorithm were
compared with the interpretation by reviewer 1 using the
selected criteria.9 Because the diagnosis differed in 27% of
cases, survival curves for those women diagnosed as pri-

mary and metastatic mucinous carcinomas were examined
by each of the two methods of interpretation (Figures 1
and 2). The log-rank test revealed no significant difference
in survival between women with primary or metastatic
mucinous carcinomas using either method of
classification.
The relative death rate was examined for each pathological characteristic. There is some evidence that the
death rate is higher among patients with signet ring cells
(hazard ratio [HR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.11-5.31; P ¼ 0.021). The precision of this estimate is
limited, because only 9 patients with this feature were
identified. Although not statistically significant, the absence of an infiltrative pattern of invasion (HR, 2.01;
95% CI, 0.825-4.90; P ¼ 0.12), and small neoplastic
glands (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 0.826-5.02; P ¼ 0.12)
were each associated with a lower death rate. Table 4
summarizes the estimated probability of surviving 3 years
for patients with and without each of the pathological
characteristics. No second primary solid malignant
neoplasm was identified in any of the 44 patients during
follow-up.
The OS for the combined groups of women with
advanced stage mucinous carcinomas was significantly
shorter than that of women with advanced stage serous
carcinoma (Figure 3), with an estimated median survival
of only of 14 months versus 42 months (P < 0.001 [logrank test]).

Figure 2. Overall survival of women with mucinous carcinomas involving the ovary is shown. Tumors were classified as
primary or metastatic according to criteria described by Lee
and Young.9 There was no significant difference in survival
between the 2 groups using this classification system (P ¼

DISCUSSION
In this subset analysis of advanced stage primary epithelial
carcinoma of the ovary, the reviewers reclassified the majority (57%-63%) of the mucinous carcinomas as metastatic to the ovary rather than primary to the ovary. These
results are disturbing but not surprising. Many if not most
of the carcinomas described and reported in some of the
classic papers on mucinous ovarian carcinoma are now
suspected to have represented occult metastatic mucinous
tumors. However, even at present, no gold standard exists
by which primary mucinous adenocarcinomas can be
distinguished from those that are metastatic to the
ovary.2-4,6-12,14-22,30 Immunohistochemical analyses
using a variety of antibodies, including CDX2, villin, bcatenin, CEA, MUC2, MUC5, Dpc4, and the presence and distribution of CK7 and CK 20, have
been employed to assist in the distinction of primary
from metastatic mucinous carcinomas, and this has
reduced but not eliminated misclassification of these
tumors.2,3,6-8,11,13,15,17-20,22,31 The addition of an
immunohistochemical panel (with antibodies such as
CK 7, CK 20, and CDX-2) for all of the mucinous
adenocarcinomas in this protocol would have increased
the ability to correctly distinguish primary mucinous
ovarian carcinomas from those metastatic to the ovary;
Cancer

however, this measure was not mandated in the protocol, and it was performed in only a few of the cases.
Interestingly, in several of these cases, the immunohistochemical results supported the interpretation of
the lesions as metastatic from the colon, but this
protocol was limited to women with advanced stage
primary ovarian carcinoma.
Ulbright et al14 and Lee and Young9 identified
partially overlapping sets of gross and microscopic characteristics that are more often associated with primary or
metastatic carcinomas involving the ovary. Interpretative
judgment is still required, however, because no single feature or group of features provides high sensitivity coupled
with high specificity. In the current study, the 3 review
pathologists independently classified the tumors based on
an assessment of 12 of the criteria described by Lee and
Young.9 Although each of the reviewers disagreed with
the submitting interpretation in approximately 60% of
cases, there was a high degree of agreement among the
reviewers’ independent classifications, with unanimity of
classification in 68% of cases.
Using the laterality and size algorithm that all
bilateral mucinous carcinomas of the ovary and all unilateral carcinomas <13 cm are metastatic, 29 of 41
(70%) tumors were reclassified as metastatic, similar to
the result obtained from using the selected criteria.23
This rule is reported to correctly classify almost 90% of
mucinous ovarian neoplasms as primary or metastatic.
However, it should be noted that the rule was derived
from a set of mucinous tumors obtained by a retrospective review of cases at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.23
In that study, 21 tumors were considered to be primary
mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. The distribution by stage was not provided, but in a previous study
including the same institution, the majority were of
early stage.3 In another study of 220 primary ovarian
carcinomas from the Washington Hospital Center, 6
were mucinous carcinoma, and only 1 of these was of
advanced stage.26 Bilateral involvement of the ovaries is
very uncommon in stage I mucinous carcinoma. However, bilateral involvement is typical in advanced stage
serous carcinoma, and it might also be common in
advanced stage mucinous carcinoma. Because most
mucinous carcinomas of the ovary are stage I and
advanced tumors were so uncommon in those prior
studies, this would have influenced the creation of the
classification criteria. There are few existing data on the
pattern of spread and distribution of tumor, particularly
for advanced stage mucinous carcinoma of the ovary.

Original Article

Most publications have not described in detail the
presence of bilateral involvement or its location in the
contralateral ovary in cases of advanced stage mucinous
carcinoma.3,32-34 Consequently, the size and laterality
algorithm may correctly classify most mucinous ovarian
tumors, but it may not do so for those few primary
mucinous carcinomas that are of advanced stage. (It
may be appropriate to consider modification of the
portion of the rule that classifies all bilateral tumors as
metastatic to permit small foci of surface involvement
of the contralateral ovary in the presence of other extraovarian disease.)
The OS for women with a reviewer diagnosis of
advanced stage primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary
was not significantly different from that of the women
with tumors interpreted as metastatic, using either the size
and laterality algorithm or the selected criteria. An examination of the estimated relative death rates for each of the
pathological characteristics revealed that possibly the
absence of signet ring cells, an infiltrative pattern of invasion, and small neoplastic glands were each associated
with longer survival. The latter two features were among
the 5 statistically best discriminators of primary from
metastatic mucinous carcinomas of the ovary in the study
by Lee and Young.9 However, in contrast to their study,
we did not find that bilaterality or an expansile pattern of
invasion delineated those likely to survive from those
likely to die of tumor.
There are several limitations to this study that are
shared with most retrospective analyses of large international clinical trials, including the inability to obtain or
perform immunohistochemical stains on each case, and
the availability of only a limited number of slides from
most cases. Confirmation of the pathological interpretation of many of these tumors as metastatic to the ovary
would be helpful, but is lacking. Although the protocol
required notification of the identification of subsequent
primary tumors, there may have been underdiagnosis of
such tumors. Evaluation for a second primary tumor
may not be as aggressive for women with advanced widespread adenocarcinomas, especially because gastrointestinal involvement is so common in advanced stage ovarian
carcinoma and the mean OS was so short. Nevertheless, in
the absence of identification of any second primary site of
neoplasm in the follow-up of any of the 44 patients, it is
possible, although highly unlikely, that all of the tumors
in this study represent advanced stage mucinous adenocarcinomas of the ovary. The strengths of this study
include the large number of total cases of advanced ovar-

560

ian carcinoma, the large number of cases submitted as
mucinous carcinoma (greatly exceeding that of any prior
study), the uniform staging requirements, standardized
chemotherapy, and ability to track survival data.
Most importantly, we found that the OS for women
with advanced stage mucinous carcinomas (whether the
ovary was the primary or metastatic site) is significantly
less than that for women with advanced stage serous carcinoma (median survival of 14 months vs 42 months,
respectively). This finding could reflect either an intrinsic
aggressive behavior of mucinous ovarian carcinoma or its
resistance to agents that are effective in the treatment of
serous carcinoma. These results are similar to those
reported by Hess. et al,35 who identified 27 cases of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage
III or IV mucinous carcinoma of the ovary over an 8-year
period. They found an OS of 12 months for patients with
mucinous ovarian carcinoma versus 37 months for controls with ovarian carcinoma of nonmucinous histology.
We support their recommendation that consideration
should be given to future investigation of therapy for
advanced mucinous carcinoma of the ovary with agents
that are effective in treating carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. From a pragmatic perspective, given our limitations in diagnostic classification, at the current time it
may not be as critical therapeutically or prognostically to
distinguish advanced stage primary ovarian from metastatic mucinous adenocarcinomas of the ovary, because
the behavior of the tumors is so poor for both subsets of
patients. However, efforts to find methods of correctly
classifying these tumors should continue, because effective
chemotherapy in the future could be limited to one subset
based on the site of origin.
In conclusion, we found that advanced stage primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary is very rare (0.5%1.5% of advanced ovarian epithelial invasive neoplasms),
and that 61% (27/44) of the primary mucinous carcinomas studied were probably metastatic to the ovary. This
conclusion rests on the assumption that the published and
generally accepted criteria applied by the reviewers to
make this distinction are accurate, because no further
investigation into identification of nonovarian sites of origin was possible in this international study. Although it
would be ideal to have immunohistochemical or molecular assays that are highly specific for gastrointestinal or
Müllerian mucinous tumors, none has been identified to
date. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in
survival between the groups of women with ovarian and
nonovarian mucinous carcinomas. However, we found

that advanced stage primary mucinous ovarian carcinoma
is highly lethal, with a significantly shorter survival than
that of women with serous carcinoma. It is reasonable to
consider the use of chemotherapeutic agents that are effective in treating carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract in
future trials of this tumor type.
