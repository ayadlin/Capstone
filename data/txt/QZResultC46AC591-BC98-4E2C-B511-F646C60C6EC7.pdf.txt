ABSTRACT
Nucleoside metabolism enzymes are determinants of chemotherapeutic drug
activity. The nucleoside salvage enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activates
gemcitabine (2′, 2′-difluoro-2′-deoxycytidine) and is negatively regulated by
deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP). Reduction of dCTP in tumor cells could,
therefore, enhance gemcitabine activity. Mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2)
phosphorylates deoxycytidine to generate dCTP. We hypothesized that: (1) TK2
modulates human tumor cell sensitivity to gemcitabine, and (2) antisense knockdown
of TK2 would decrease dCTP and increase dCK activity and gemcitabine activation.
siRNA downregulation of TK2 sensitized MCF7 and HeLa cells (high and moderate
TK2) but not A549 cells (low TK2) to gemcitabine. Combined treatment with TK2
siRNA and gemcitabine increased dCK. We also hypothesized that TK2 siRNA-induced
drug sensitization results in mitochondrial damage that enhances gemcitabine
effectiveness. TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine decreased mitochondrial redox status,
DNA content, and activity. This is the first demonstration of a direct role for TK2 in
gemcitabine resistance, or any independent role in cancer drug resistance, and further
distinguishes TK2 function from that of other dTMP-producing enzymes [cytosolic
TK1 and thymidylate synthase (TS)]. siRNA knockdown of TK1 and/or TS did not
sensitize cancer cells to gemcitabine indicating that, among the 3 enzymes, only TK2
is a candidate therapeutic target for combination with gemcitabine.

deoxycytidine to its monophosphorylated form [3]. In
addition, dCK also activates gemcitabine (2′, 2′-difluoro2′-deoxycytidine, dFdC; a deoxycytidine analog antimetabolite anticancer drug) by catalyzing production
of gemcitabine monophosphate and subsequent active
metabolites [6]. However, dCK is negatively regulated
by deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and increased
dCTP diminishes the net cytotoxic, anticancer activity of
gemcitabine.

INTRODUCTION
Nucleoside-metabolizing enzymes are important
determinants of the activity of antimetabolite chemo­
therapy drugs [1]. However, other than the use of
inhibitors of catabolic enzymes [2], little has been done
to manipulate metabolic pathways to improve drug
efficacy. The nucleoside salvage enzyme deoxycytidine
kinase (dCK) normally catalyzes phosphorylation of

Thymidine kinases 1 and 2 (TK1 and TK2) are
salvage enzymes capable of phosphorylating cellular
thymidine to generate deoxythymidine essential for DNA
synthesis. Unlike cytosolic, cell cycle-dependent TK1,
TK2 is cell cycle-independent and present in mitochondria.
TK2, but not TK1, is promiscuous with respect to substrate
[4–6]: it can, in addition to phosphorylating thymidine,
phosphorylate deoxycytidine to generate dCTP that, in
turn, can reduce gemcitabine activity. Thus, TK2 in human
tumor cells could reduce gemcitabine effectiveness.
We previously reported that TK2 has potential as
a therapeutic target in treatment of human cancers if its
down-regulation by antisense is combined with widely-used
cytotoxic anticancer agents and antisense molecules targeting
thymidylate synthase (TS) [7]. In that scenario, antisensereduced TS and TK2 combined to sensitize human tumor cells
to the anti-TS drug 5-FUdR. Functions of TK2, including
those distinct from cytosolic TK1, are not fully characterized.
Inhibition of TK2 has potential to improve cancer therapy.
Gemcitabine is used to treat a variety of tumor
types (lung, breast, ovarian, bladder and pancreas) [8].
Incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP)
into DNA in place of dCTP during synthesis results
in cell death due to termination of DNA synthesis [9]
and gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) is thought to
irreversibly bind the active M1 subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase (RR) with therapeutic benefit [10]. dCK, in
addition to phosphorylating deoxycytidine to generate
dCMP, also mediates the initial activating phosphorylation
of the anticancer drug gemcitabine (a prodrug) to produce
gemcitabine monophosphate and subsequently active
metabolites [11]. Under normal conditions of feedback
regulation, deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) negatively
regulates dCK activity [12, 13]. Thus, the presence of a
pool of dCTP represses dCK activity and gemcitabine
activation.
The substrate promiscuity of TK2 suggests that
TK2-mediated production of dCMP and the resulting
increase in dCTP could contribute to dCK feedback
inhibition that decreases gemcitabine activation and
effectiveness. We hypothesized that: (1) TK2 contributes
to cellular resistance to gemcitabine, and (2) antisense
siRNA downregulation of TK2 will sensitize human
tumor cells to gemcitabine. It is important to note that
gemcitabine is a poor substrate for TK2 [14].
TK2 is a constitutively-expressed mitochondrial
enzyme that participates in maintenance and production
of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Gemcitabine decreases
mtDNA synthesis by inhibiting mitochondrial DNA
polymerase holoenzyme (DNA polymerase gamma)
[15]. Consequently, the potential for antisense-mediated
reduction of TK2 to modulate mitochondrial function,
increase mitochondrial damage, and improve gemcitabine
cytotoxicity was explored.
We show for the first time that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of TK2 sensitized TK2-expressing cancer

cell lines (MCF7 and HeLa) to the anti-proliferative
effects of gemcitabine in vitro. The effect was specific to
TK2, as knockdown of other dTMP-producing enzymes
(thymidylate synthase and TK1), alone or in combination
with TK2 siRNA treatment, did not further sensitize
tumor cells to gemcitabine beyond that induced by TK2
knockdown alone. Combined TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine
treatment inhibited mitochondrial function.

RESULTS
TK2 is expressed in human tumor cells and
decreased by siRNAs
MCF7, HeLa and A549 human tumor cell lines
differed with respect to basal TK2 protein (Figure 1A)
and are labeled TK2HIGH (MCF7), TK2 MEDIUM (HeLa)
and TK2 LOW (A549). A549 cells had only 7%, while
HeLa cells had 30%, of the amount of TK2 in MCF7
cells.
TK2 siRNAs downregulated TK2 mRNA in MCF7
cells by 60–75% compared to control at 24–96 h posttransfection (Supplementary Figure S1). This translated
to a decrease in TK2 protein of approximately 25% by
72 h and 96 h post-transfection (Figure 1B). HeLa cell
TK2 protein was similarly reduced by siRNA treatment
at 96 h post-transfection (Figure 1C). MCF7, HeLa, and
A549 cells had similar siRNA transfection efficiencies
(Supplementary Figure S2). Consequently, differences
among cell lines caused by TK2 siRNA transfection are
not attributable to differential transfection efficiency.

Antisense knockdown of TK2 sensitized
TK2MEDIUM (HeLa) and TK2HIGH (MCF7) cells,
but not TK2LOW (A549) cells, to gemcitabine
TK2-targeting siRNAs #9 and #11 target different
portions of the TK2 mRNA sequence. TK2#9 siRNA and
TK2#11 siRNA (compared to C2 and C3 non-targeting
siRNAs, respectively), reduced TK2 in all 3 cell lines.
The effect of antisense-mediated TK2 reduction on
sensitivity to gemcitabine was assessed. To demonstrate
siRNA-induced sensitization to gemcitabine, proliferation
in the presence of combinations with gemcitabine were
normalized to that of treatment with siRNAs alone
(without gemcitabine). There was no significant inhibition
of proliferation induced by control siRNAs alone (C2 or
C3) or TK2-targeting siRNAs alone (TK2#9 or TK2#11)
(Supplementary Figure 3).
TK2 siRNA sensitized TK2HIGH MCF7 cells and
TK2MEDIUM HeLa cells to gemcitabine (Figure 2). TK2
knockdown in TK2HIGH MCF7 cells by either of the
two TK2 siRNAs enhanced gemcitabine-mediated
reduction in proliferation by 30–50% (Figure 2A, 2B)
and TK2MEDIUM HeLa cells by 15–50% (Figure 2C, 2D),
depending on the gemcitabine concentration. TK2 siRNA

sensitization to impairment of mitochondrial function
as a consequence of TK2 knockdown in the context of
gemcitabine treatment was assessed. After a 96-h treatment
with TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine (treated at the IC50,
as determined in cells treated with TK2 siRNAs), total
DNA was collected from TK2HIGH (MCF7) and TK2LOW
(A549) cells, and mtDNA:nDNA ratios were assessed.
TK2 siRNA-induced sensitization to gemcitabine in
TK2HIGH MCF7 cells (Figure 2A, 2B) was accompanied
by reduction in the mtDNA:nDNA ratio (Figure 5A).
There was no reduction in that ratio in identically-treated
TK2LOW A549 cells (Figure 5B), consistent with the lack of
gemcitabine sensitization induced by TK2 siRNA in those
cells (Figure 2E, 2F).

with gemcitabine, is novel. dCK is required to activate
gemcitabine and, in fact, decreased dCK levels in vitro
mediate gemcitabine resistance [21, 22]. Higher TK2
expression may indicate greater reliance on TK2 for
production of dCMP/dCTP, compared to cells with lower
TK2 (for example, MCF7 and HeLa cells compared to
A549 cells). When TK2-expressing cells were targeted
with both TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine, dCK levels
increased, possibly to compensate for decreased dCTP.
A relationship among dCK, gemcitabine, and
TK2 is proposed (Figure 3E). dCK phosphorylates both
deoxycytidine and the anticancer drug gemcitabine.
dCK is negatively regulated by the feedback inhibition
of dCTP, as is TK2. TK2 monophosphorylates both
deoxythymidine and deoxycytidine, but gemcitabine
is very poorly phosphorylated by TK2. Thus, TK2
contributes to levels of dCTP that negatively regulate
dCK. TK2-produced dCTP would inhibit dCK and,
consequently, decrease the amount of dCK available to
activate gemcitabine. siRNA-mediated reduction in TK2,
in combination with gemcitabine, results in increased dCK
enzyme levels and likely contributes to a greater response
to the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine. Thus, TK2
contributes to gemcitabine resistance.
TK2 is one of three enzymes that mediate dTMP
synthesis: in addition to the activity of TK2, thymidylate
synthase (TS) is responsible for de novo dTMP production,
and TK1 is an additional dTMP salvage pathway enzyme
[16, 17]. siRNA treatments were used to decrease TS,
TK1, and TK2 either singly or in combinations (both
TS and TK2; both TK1 and TK2; all 3). Sensitization to
gemcitabine appears to be specific to knockdown of TK2
alone and cannot be generalized to knockdown of the
other dTMP-producing enzymes (TS and TK1), alone or
in combination with each other.
Implications of decreased TK2 in the context of
combined treatment with gemcitabine were also explored
with a focus on mitochondrial toxicity. Gemcitabine
can inhibit the activity of human mitochondrial DNA
polymerase gamma [15]. This, in combination with a
reduction in TK2, may contribute to the preferential
decrease in mtDNA. Mitochondria are susceptible to the
toxic effects of nucleoside analogues and patients exposed
to prolonged nucleoside analogue chemotherapy, including
gemcitabine, display similar pathology to a heterogeneous
group of disorders (mtDNA depletion disorders) caused
by mutations and deletions in the TK2 gene [23–27]. Both
MCF7 and A549 cells were treated with a concentration
of gemcitabine that resulted in a 50% growth inhibition
in the presence of TK2 siRNA (Figure 5). The decrease in
mtDNA:nDNA ratio was concomitant with sensitization
to gemcitabine induced by TK2 siRNA in TK2HIGH
(MCF7) cells (Figure 5A), but not A549 cells with low
TK2 (Figure 5B), implies that TK2 is critically involved
in tumor cell mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent
toxicity in response to combined treatment with TK2

Combined treatment with TK2 siRNA and
gemcitabine decreased mitochondrial activity
Relative mtDNA content (the mtDNA:nDNA
ratio) is an indirect indicator of mtDNA function and
mitochondrial biogenesis and activity [19]. Mitotracker
CMX ROS staining depends on intact, functional
mitochondrial membrane, and the degree of staining is
correlated with intact mitochondrial membrane potential
and mitochondrial activity. Mitochondrial function and
activity were assessed more directly using Mitotracker
staining and flow cytometry.
Treatment with TK2 siRNA as a single agent
did not change MitoTracker staining (Figure 6). TK2
siRNA treatment decreased mitochondrial activity at
both concentrations of gemcitabine in TK2HIGH (MCF7)
cells (Figure 6A), but only at the higher concentration
of gemcitabine in TK2MEDIUM (HeLa) cells (Figure 6B).
TK2 siRNA treatment of the TK2LOW(A549) cell line did
not affect mitochondrial activity in combination with
gemcitabine (Figure 6C). In TK2-expressing cell lines,
combined treatment with TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine
decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and activity.

DISCUSSION
Differences in achievable TK2 siRNA-induced
sensitization to gemcitabine in cell lines appears, at
least in part, to be due to differences in basal TK2 levels
(Figure  1A). Although antisense treatment decreased
TK2 protein by only about 25% in MCF7 and HeLa cells
(Figure 1B, 1C), it sensitized those cells to gemcitabine
by as much as 50% (Figure 2A–2D). This suggests a
significant contribution of TK2 to gemcitabine resistance.
An increase in dCK levels in human tumor cells was
demonstrated for the first time in response to combined
treatment with TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine (but neither
treatment alone) (Figure 3B, 3D). Although others have
reported increased dCTP levels in response to reduced
TK2 in HeLa cells [20], increased dCK levels in response
to antisense targeting of TK2, particularly in combination

MATERIALS AND METHODS

siRNA and gemcitabine in these cells. We further showed
that combined treatment with TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine
results in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential
and activity in TK2HIGH- and TK2MEDIUM-expressing cells
(Figure 6). These data implicate increased mitochondrial
toxicity as a critical event in gemcitabine sensitization.
Whether mitochondrial toxicity is the result of increased
gemcitabine activity, or damage to mitochondria increases
tumor cell sensitivity to gemcitabine, remains to be
determined.
It has been suggested that TK2 plays a role in the
effectiveness of deoxycytidine nucleoside analogues
such as gemcitabine, and that the mitochondria could
play a role in both toxicity and antitumor activity [13,
24, 28, 29]. Prior to the current study, there has been no
report of the consequences of antisense-mediated TK2
reduction on gemcitabine effectiveness and mitochondrial
function. This report is the first to demonstrate that TK2
mediates resistance to gemcitabine, and identifies TK2
as a potentially valuable target for anticancer therapy in
combination with gemcitabine. Although siRNAs are
difficult to administer effectively in vivo due to stability
and pharmacokinetic challenges [30–32], TK2-inhibiting
small molecules including those reported by others
[33, 34] may be appropriate candidate TK2-targeting
agents for use in combination with gemcitabine. This
also sets a precedent for the potential use of other TK2targeting antisense molecules such as phosphorothioated
oligodeoxynucleotides, the clinical use of which is
approved for some indications. Targeting of TK2 is likely
to be of optimal therapeutic use in combination with
gemcitabine or related drugs. siRNA-mediated knockdown
of TK2 alone did it not reduce tumor cell proliferation, nor
did it sensitize cells to pemetrexed, cisplatin, or 5FUdR [7].
We show for the first time that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of TK2 preferentially sensitizes TK2expressing cancer cell lines to the anti-proliferative
effects of gemcitabine in vitro. Furthermore, combined
treatment with TK2 siRNA and gemcitabine, in addition to
increasing gemcitabine effectiveness as an antiproliferative
agent, increased dCK enzyme levels. With respect
to mitochondrial toxicity, combined TK2 siRNA and
gemcitabine treatment: (1) decreased cellular metabolic
activity, (2) preferentially decreased mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA, in the form of a decreased mtDNA:nDNA ratio),
and (3) decreased mitochondrial activity. None of these
effects (sensitization to gemcitabine or mitochondrial
toxicity) were seen in A549 non-small cell lung cancer
cells with low basal TK2 expression (7% of that in MCF7
and 25% of that in HeLa cells). Overall, these data indicate
that endogenous TK2 in human tumor cells can reduce
the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine, and antisense
knockdown of TK2 increases gemcitabine activity.
TK2 appears to have potential as a therapeutic target in
cancer treatment and as a diagnostic biomarker of relative
resistance to gemcitabine in human tumors.

Human tumor cell lines
Breast epithelial adenocarcinoma (MCF7), human
cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and lung epithelial carcinoma
(A549) cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Their
characteristics and maintenance information are as
previously described [7], except that A549 were cultured
using Alpha Modification of Eagle’s Medium (AMEM)
(Wisent Inc., St-Bruno, QC, Canada).

siRNAs
All siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon RNA
Technologies-Thermo Scientific (Lafayette, CO, USA).
siRNA sequences are shown in Table 1. Control siRNAs
C2 and C3 contain four or more mismatches to all known
human RNAs.

Drugs
Gemcitabine (Gemzar, Eli Lilly and Co., Toronto,
ON, Canada) was purchased from the London Regional
Cancer Program pharmacy.

siRNA Transfection
Cells were plated (3.5 × 105 cells/ per 25-cm5 flask)
24 h prior to siRNA transfection. Cells were transfected
with 10 nM total siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2K,
Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) according to
manufacturer’s instructions [7]. Four h after transfection,
cells were harvested at specified times and at no more than
75% confluence from triplicate flasks, pooled (to avoid
variability in siRNA transfection) and replated into 6-well
or 96-well plates, or 25-cm5 flasks, prior to drug treatment.
In certain experiments, gemcitabine-containing medium
or medium only was added to cells 4 h after replating.
When TK2 #9 siRNA, TS siRNA, and TK1 siRNA were
combined, respective nM concentrations were 4:3:3. When
used singly or in combination with one other siRNA, the
same nM concentrations were used and brought to a total
of 10 nM with C2 siRNA.

mRNA measurement
Cells collected for mRNA analysis were lysed in
TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies), and total cellular
RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Purified RNA (1 μg) was used to synthesize
cDNA by reverse transcription by MMLV-RT (Life
Technologies) and random primers according to the
protocol provided by the manufacturer. TK2 mRNA
and GAPDH mRNA were assessed simultaneously by
multiplex real-time qPCR amplification using a TaqMan

in TBS-T), and rabbit anti-human actin antibody (SigmaAldrich, 1:1000 in 1% skim milk in TBS-T). Bands were
detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugate anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (GE Healthcare Biosciences, 1:10,000)
on a STORM 860 Molecular Imager (Amersham BiotechMolecular Dynamics Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Band
intensity was quantified using ImageQuant 5.1 software
(Amersham Biotech-Molecular Dynamics Inc.). TK2 and
dCK were normalized to the actin internal standard and then

Cell viability staining assay
After siRNA transfection, cells were replated into
96- well plates and treated, in triplicate, with drug or control
medium. Relative cell density after 96 h was determined
using the vital stainalamarBlue and measuring fluorescence
(595 nm) using a Wallac Victor21420 multilabel counter
(PerkinElmer, Woodbridge, ON, Canada).

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (mtDNA and
nDNA) measurement
Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA target genes, DNA
isolation, and primer and probe sequences for quantitative
PCR assessment of relative nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
content were as described previously [35–39]. Total DNA
was isolated from cells, and relative mtDNA and nDNA
in 300 ng of total DNA were estimated by quantitative

Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in media with
10% FBS, washed twice in PBS and precipitated by
centrifugation. When transfection efficiency was assessed
in cells transfected with Cy3-labeled siRNA, cells were
harvested 4 h post-transfection and resuspended in 400 μl
PBS after the final PBS wash. When mitochondrial
number/activity was assessed using Mitotracker® Red
CMXRos (Invitrogen), cells were incubated in Mitotracker
(200 nM, 37°C, 20 min) prior to washing in PBS and
resuspendion in PBS (400 μl). Cy3 fluorescence or
Mitotracker signal were assessed in unfixed cells using
a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickenson,
Mississauga, Canada). Relative fluorescence intensity was
analyzed using FlowJo V10 software.
