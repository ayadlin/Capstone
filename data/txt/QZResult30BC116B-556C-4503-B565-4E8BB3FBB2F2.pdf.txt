Abstract
Previously, we showed that the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor ; (PPAR;) agonist troglitazone at high
doses was able to suppress androgen receptor (AR) expression
in LNCaP prostate cancer cells independently of PPAR;.
Pharmacologic exploitation of this finding led to STG28, a
PPAR;-inactive analogue of troglitazone with substantially
higher potency in AR repression. Considering the pivotal role
of AR in prostate tumorigenesis, this study investigates the
mechanism by which troglitazone and derivatives suppress AR
expression in LNCaP cells. Reverse transcription-PCR and
reporter gene assays indicate that this drug-induced AR
repression occurs at both mRNA and protein levels. Evidence
suggests that troglitazone and derivatives mediate the
transcriptional repression of AR by facilitating the ubiquitindependent proteasomal degradation of the transcriptional
factor Sp1. These agents also cause the proteolysis of two
proteins that regulate Sp1-mediated transcription (i.e., the
TATA-binding protein–associated factor TAFII250 and cyclin
D1). However, their involvement in the transcriptional
repression of AR is refuted by the finding that small
interfering RNA knockdown of these two regulatory proteins
does not cause AR down-regulation. STG28 does not cause
significant reduction in Sp1 or AR expression in normal
prostate epithelial cells. This discriminatory effect underscores the differential susceptibility of malignant versus
normal cells to the inhibitory effect of STG28 on cell viability.
From a translational perspective, STG28 provides a proof of
principle that potent AR-ablative agents could be developed
through structural modifications of troglitazone. Moreover, as
the control of Sp1 degradation remains unclear, STG28
represents a unique pharmacologic probe to investigate the
ubiquitin-proteasome system that regulates Sp1 proteolysis.

Introduction
A major challenge in the management of patients with prostate
cancer is the treatment of hormone-refractory tumors (HRPC), a
hallmark of incurable and lethal prostate cancer progression. To
date, chemotherapeutic regimens provide substantive benefits
through palliation but yield no definitive enhancements in survival.

A clear need exists for novel strategies that will improve the
treatment of prostate cancer and ultimately increase the survival of
prostate cancer patients. Recent advances have identified key
pathways that contribute to the development of HRPC, among
which androgen receptor (AR) gene amplification and mutations
play a crucial role in facilitating androgen-refractory progression
(1–7). These molecular defects enhance AR sensitivity and permit
AR activation by antiandrogens, respectively, thereby allowing
prostate cancer cells to acquire a resistant phenotype to androgen
withdrawal-induced apoptosis (8, 9).
Considering the clinical relevance of AR in androgen-refractory
prostate cancer, identification of small-molecule agents that
interfere with AR expression/function has been the focus of many
investigations (3, 10–14). Previously, data from this and other
laboratories indicate that the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-g (PPARg) agonist troglitazone might interfere with AR
function through two PPARg-independent mechanisms (15, 16). At
concentrations f10 Amol/L, troglitazone and its PPARg-inactive
derivative D2TG repressed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) through
the inhibition of AR recruitment to the PSA promoter. At
substantially higher concentrations (z40 Amol/L), troglitazone
and D2TG were able to suppress AR expression through a yet
unidentified mechanism (16). From a therapeutic perspective,
separation of AR repression from PPARg agonist activity provides a
molecular rationale for the pharmacologic exploitation of D2TG to
develop AR-ablative agent, of which the proof of principle was
shown by STG28, a structurally optimized derivative. Here, we
report that troglitazone, D2TG, and STG28 inhibit AR expression at
the transcriptional level by facilitating the proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor Sp1.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Troglitazone and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). D2TG {5-[4-(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8tetramethylchroman-2-yl)-methoxy-benzylidene]-2,4-thiazolidine-dione}
and STG28 {5-[(4-{[(S)-6-(allyloxy)-3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-chromen-2yl]-methoxy}-3-methoxyphenyl)-methylene]-thiazolidine-2,4-dione}
were synthesized according to a procedure reported elsewhere (17). The
identity and purity (z99%) of these synthetic agents were verified by
nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and
elemental analysis. These agents were dissolved in DMSO and added to
cells in medium at various concentrations with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. Mouse antibodies against AR, PSA, a-tubulin, cyclin D1, and
p300 and rabbit antibodies against Sp1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies against poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsive element binding
protein (CREB) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.
(Beverly, MA). The proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin was a kind gift from

IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates and rabbit anti-mouse IgGHRP conjugates were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West
Grove, PA).
Cell culture. LNCaP androgen-dependent (p53+/+) and PC3 androgennonresponsive (p53 / ) prostate cancer cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI
1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Normal
prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were obtained from Cambrex BioscienceWalkersville, Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in the vendor’s
recommended defined prostate epithelial growth medium. All cell types
were cultured at 37jC in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Cells
in log-phase growth were harvested by trypsinization for use in viability
assays.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was assessed by using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in six
replicates (96-well format). Cancer cells and PrECs were seeded at 2,500 to
3,000 and 8,000 per well, respectively, in 96-well flat-bottomed plates and
incubated for 24 h in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 or 10% FBSsupplemented prostate epithelial growth medium. The cells were then
treated with STG28 at the indicated concentrations. Controls received
DMSO at a concentration equal to that in drug-treated cells. After 48 h, onetenth volume of 10 MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and cells were
incubated at 37jC for 2 h. Medium was removed and the reduced MTT
dye was solubilized in 200 AL/well DMSO. Absorbance was determined at
570 nm.
Cell cycle analysis. LNCaP cells were exposed to STG28 at indicated
concentrations in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 for 48 h, collected by
trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, and then fixed in ice-cold 40%
ethanol at 20jC overnight. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 400  g
at room temperature, and after decanting the ethanol without disturbing
the pellet, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) and
RNase A (100 units/mL) in PBS. Cell cycle phase distributions were
determined on a FACScort flow cytometer and analyzed by the ModFitLT
V3.0 program.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. LNCaP cells
were subjected to total RNA isolation by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were determined by measuring
absorption at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer. Aliquots of 6 Ag of total
RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed to cDNA using an
Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR primers used were as follows: AR, 5¶-ACACATTGAAGGCTATGAATGTC-3¶ and 5¶-TCACTGGGTGTGGAAATAGATGGG-3¶; human protease-activated receptor-1 (hPar-1), 5¶-GCCAGAATCAAAAGCAACAA-3¶ and
5¶-GAGATGAATGCAGGAAGTTGTTT-3¶; fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8),
5¶-AAAGGCAAGGACTGCGTCTTCACG-3¶ and 5¶-CGTGAAGGGCGGGTAGTTGAG-3¶; and h-actin, 5¶-TCTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTG-3¶ and
5¶-GGTCAGGATCTTCATGAGGT-3¶. PCR primers for Sp1, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), and TAFII250 were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. PCR products were separated electrophoretically by 1.2%
agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Transfection and luciferase assay. The 3.6-kb AR promoter-linked
reporter plasmid p-3600ARCAT was kindly provided by Dr. Chawnshang
Chang (University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY). The AR
promoter gene ( 3,600 to +550) encompassing the transcription start site
was isolated by using PCR to generate hAR-luc with the following primers:
5¶-TACAGGTACCGGTATCTCGACCTGCAGGTC-3¶ and 5¶-TGTTAGATCTTGCTGAAGCCGCTCCCCAGT-3¶. The fragment was subcloned into the
pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at KpnI and BglII
in the multiple cloning site. The PPRE-x3-TK-Luc reporter vector contains
three copies of the PPAR response element (PPRE) upstream of the
thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase fusion gene and was kindly provided
by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). The
pCMVSp1 plasmid was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc.
(Rockville, MD). LNCaP or PC3 cells were transfected with 5 Ag of
individual plasmids in an Amaxa Nucleofector using a cell line–specific
nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Amaxa
Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) and then seeded in six-well plates at

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

5  105 per well for 48 h. The transfection efficiency was determined to be
70% to 80% by transfecting cells with 2 Ag of pmaxGFP plasmid followed by
fluorescence microscopy to measure green fluorescent protein expression.
For each transfection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase
promoter-driven Renilla reniformis luciferase was used as an internal
control for normalization.
For the reporter gene assay, after transfection, cells were cultured in
24-well plates in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 for 48 h, subjected to
different treatments for the indicated times, collected, and lysed with passive
lysis buffer (Promega). Aliquots of the lysates (50 AL) were added to 96-well
plates, and luciferase activity was monitored after adding 100 AL of luciferase
substrate (Promega) each well by using a MicroLumatPlus LB96V
luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN) with the WinGlow
software package. All transfection experiments were carried out in six
replicates.
Immunoblotting. Cells in T-75 flasks were collected by scraping, and
cell lysates were prepared using M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in
the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)
consisting of 100 mmol/L 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride,
80 nmol/L aprotinin, 5 mmol/L bestatin, 1.5 mmol/L E-64 protease
inhibitor, 2 mmol/L leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L pepstatin A. After centrifugation for 20 min, 2 AL of the suspension were taken for protein
determination using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To the
remaining solution was added the same volume of 2 SDS-PAGE sample
loading buffer [100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 5%
h-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue] and boiled for
5 min. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry
transfer cell. The transblotted membrane was washed twice with TBS
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). After blocking with TBST containing 5%
nonfat milk for 40 min, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate
primary antibody in TBST-1% nonfat milk at 4jC overnight. All primary
antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 in 1% nonfat milk–containing TBST. After
treatment with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed thrice
with TBST for a total of 15 min followed by incubation with goat antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugates (diluted 1:5,000) for 1 h at room
temperature and three washes with TBST for a total of 1 h. The immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Small interfering RNA transfection. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
duplexes for TAFII250, Sp1, cyclin D1, and scrambled siRNA were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. LNCaP cells were cultured in six-well plates
and transfected with 6 AL of transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the indicated amount of siRNA according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Immunoprecipitation. LNCaP cells were transfected with 5 Ag of
hemagglutinin (HA)-ubiquitin plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Hung-Wen
Chen, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan) in an Amaxa Nucleofector using
a LNCaP-specific nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol
and then seeded in six-well plates at 5  105 per well. After 48-h incubation, cells were treated with 10 Amol/L STG28 alone or in combination
with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132 or epoxomicin) for 12 h and lysed by
radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
with freshly added phosphatase and protease inhibitors consisting of
100 Amol/L 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 80 nmol/L aprotinin, 5 Amol/L bestatin, 1.5 Amol/L E-64 protease inhibitor, 2 Amol/L
leupeptin, 1 Amol/L pepstatin A, 2 mmol/L imidazole, 1 mmol/L sodium
fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium molybdate, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
and 4 mmol/L sodium tartrate dihydrate. After centrifugation at 13,000  g
for 15 min, the supernatant was collected, preincubated with protein
A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min, and centrifuged at
1,000  g for 5 min. Supernatant (10 AL) was stored away at 4jC to be
used as input, whereas the remainder was exposed to anti-Sp1 antibodyagarose conjugates at 4jC for 12 h. After brief centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were collected, washed with the aforementioned lysis buffer
twice, suspended in 2 SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot
analysis with antibodies against HA (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and Sp1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Suppression of AR Expression by Troglitazone
Immunocytochemical analysis. LNCaP cells were cultured on slides in
six-well plates (500,000 per well) in 10% FBS-supplemented phenol red–
free RPMI 1640, exposed to 10 Amol/L STG28 for different intervals,
washed with Dulbecco’s PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at
37jC, and then washed with PBS twice. For costaining of Sp1 and AR, cells
were treated with mouse monoclonal anti-AR (1:250 dilution) in PBS
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin at 4jC for
5 h, washed with PBS, and then treated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1
(1:250 dilution) in PBS at 4jC overnight. For fluorescent microscopy,
Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse
IgG (1:400 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for
conjugating Sp1 and AR, respectively. The nuclear counterstaining was
done using a 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-containing mounting
medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) before examination.
Images of immunocytochemically labeled samples were observed using a
Nikon (Melville, NY) microscope (Eclipse TE300).

Results
Pharmacologic exploitation of the PPAR;-independent
effect of troglitazone on AR repression to develop AR-ablative
agents. Our previous report indicates that troglitazone and its
PPARg-inactive analogue D2TG were able to suppress the
expression of AR in LNCaP cells irrespective of their PPARg
activities (16). However, the concentration of either agent required
for AR repression was substantially higher than that required for
PSA down-regulation (40 versus 10 Amol/L), indicating that the
mechanisms underlying the repression of AR and PSA differed.
From a translational perspective, dissociation of these two
pharmacologic activities (AR repression versus PPARg activation)
provided a molecular basis to use D2TG as a scaffold to develop
novel AR-ablative agents. Accordingly, structure-activity analysis

of a series of D2TG derivatives via Western blotting identified an
optimal agent, STG28, which exhibited multifold higher potency
than troglitazone and D2TG in AR repression in 10% FBSsupplemented medium (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, the potency in
repressing PSA was comparable among these three agents. The
PPRE-luciferase reporter assay indicates that STG28, like its parent
compound D2TG, lacked appreciable activity in PPARg transactivation (Fig. 1B).
Relative to LNCaP cells, normal PrECs were resistant to the
effect of STG28 on suppressing AR expression and cell viability
(Fig. 1C). As shown, exposure of PrECs to 10 Amol/L STG28 did
not cause appreciable reduction in AR expression level throughout
the course of investigation (Fig. 1C, top). This discriminatory
effect underscored the differential susceptibility of LNCaP cells
versus PrECs to the inhibitory effect of STG28 on cell viability
(Fig. 1C, bottom). For example, treatment of LNCaP cells and PrECs
to 20 Amol/L STG28 in 10% FBS-supplemented medium for
48 h caused 18% and 51% cell death, respectively.
To investigate the role of cell cycle arrest versus apoptosis in
STG28-mediated suppression of cell viability, cell cycle analysis
was carried out after exposing LNCaP cells to different doses of
STG28 for 48 h (Fig. 1D). As shown, STG28 caused G1 arrest at
V5 Amol/L, accompanied by decreases in the S phase. Meanwhile,
treatment with STG28 at z10 Amol/L led to a dose-dependent
increase in apoptotic cells (sub-G1). These data suggest that both
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis contributed to the antiproliferative
effects of STG28.
Together, STG28 provides a proof of principle that the unique
ability of troglitazone and D2TG in AR repression could be

pharmacologically exploited to develop a novel class of AR-ablative
agents.
Troglitazone and PPAR;-inactive analogues inhibit AR
expression at the mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP cells.
Two lines of evidence indicate that this decrease in AR protein
contents was attributable to the transcriptional repression of AR
gene expression. First, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis of the mRNA transcript of AR gene in LNCaP cells
showed a dose-dependent decrease after exposure to individual
agents for 48 h (Fig. 2A). Second, the AR promoter-luciferase
reporter gene assay confirmed that these agents were able to
inhibit AR gene transcription in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2B).
STG28 causes the transcriptional repression of AR downstream target genes. To validate the above finding, we examined
the effect of STG28 on the transcriptional repression of AR
downstream target genes, including those encoding EGFR, hPar-1,
and FGF8. These genes contain the androgen response element in
their promoter regions and are regulated by AR. It is well
understood that these AR-regulated genes play a key role in
prostate tumorigenesis and cancer progression (18–20). RT-PCR
analysis indicates that exposure of LNCaP cells to STG28 in 10%
FBS-supplemented medium led to a dose-dependent decrease in the
mRNA levels of these genes (Fig. 2C).
Putative targets for the drug-induced transcriptional
repression of the AR. We hypothesized that troglitazone and
derivatives mediated the inhibition of AR mRNA expression by
targeting the transcriptional regulators of the AR promoter, such
as Sp1, CREB, and the TATA-binding protein–associated factor

Suppression of AR Expression by Troglitazone

TAFII250 (21–24). In addition, our previous study showed that
troglitazone and derivatives were able to repress cyclin D1 by
activating the proteasome-facilitated proteolysis (25). Considering a possible role of cyclin D1 in regulating Sp1-mediated
transcription through the interaction with TAFII250 (26), we
examined the effect of troglitazone, D2TG, and STG28 on the
protein level of these putative targets. Moreover, the effect on
p300, an AR coactivator involved in the regulation of PSA
expression (27), was tested to examine the specificity of the drug
action.
As shown, troglitazone, D2TG, and STG28 caused a dosedependent reduction in the proteins expression of cyclin D1,
TAFII250, and Sp1 in LNCaP cells in 10% FBS-supplemented
medium, whereas the levels of CREB and p300 remained
unaffected (Fig. 3A). Figure 3B depicts the time course of the
effect of 10 Amol/L STG28 on the expression levels of this panel of
proteins compared with that of AR (Fig. 3B, left). Among them,
cyclin D1 exhibited the highest susceptibility to the drug-induced
ablation, which was completely depleted in drug-treated cells

within 24 h. In contrast, TAFII250, Sp1, and AR were degraded in a
more gradual manner, and no decrease in the intracellular levels of
CREB or p300 was noted.
In light of the direct involvement of Sp1 in the transcriptional
regulation of AR, we examined the temporal and spatial effect of
STG28 on the repression of Sp1 and AR by immunocytochemical
analysis (Fig. 3B, right). In the presence of 10% FBS, Sp1 and
AR were predominantly localized to the nucleus of LNCaP
cells. Exposure to 10 Amol/L STG28 led to a gradual, timedependent decline in both protein levels in a manner similar
to that observed by Western blotting. Moreover, our data show
that the STG28-mediated degradation of Sp1 preceded the
process of apoptotic death. As shown, a 50% decrease in Sp1
expression was noted after 12 h of exposure to 10 Amol/L STG28
in 10% FBS-containing medium. In contrast, apoptosis did not
take place until 24 h after treatment as indicated by PARP
cleavage (Fig. 3C). This finding suggests that STG28-facilitated
Sp1 down-regulation did not result from drug-induced apoptotic
death.

A, dose-dependent effect of troglitazone, D2TG, and

cells. Cells were treated with 10 Amol/L STG28 in 10%
FBS-containing RPMI 1640 for 48 h. Total RNA was
isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described in
Materials and Methods. h-Actin mRNA served as an
internal standard. The values in percentage denote the

and epoxomicin on STG28-mediated Sp1 repression.
LNCaP cells were treated with 10 Amol/L STG28 alone or
in combination with the indicated concentrations of
MG132 or epoxomicin in 10% FBS-supplemented medium
for 24 h, and the expression levels of Sp1 and TAFII250
were analyzed by Western blotting. The values in
percentage denote the relative intensity of protein bands of
drug-treated samples to that of the respective DMSO
vehicle-treated control after being normalized to the

ubiquitination in STG28-treated LNCaP cells. Cells were
transiently transfected with HA-ubiquitin plasmids and
treated with 10 Amol/L, alone or in combination, with the
indicated concentrations of MG132 or epoxomicin in
10% FBS-supplemented medium for 12 h. Cell lysates
were immunoblotted with anti-Sp1 antibodies (input) or
immunoprecipitated (IP ) with anti-Sp1-agarose
conjugates, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by
Western blotting (WB ) with anti-Sp1 (left) or anti-HA
(right ) as described in Materials and Methods.

It is noteworthy that STG28 had no significant effect on Sp1
expression in PrECs throughout a 48-h incubation (Fig. 3D), which
is in line with that observed with AR expression.
In contrast to AR, RT-PCR analysis indicates that the mRNA levels
of Sp1 and TAFII250 remained unaltered after exposure to
troglitazone, D2TG, and STG28 for 48 h (Fig. 4A), which suggests
that the drug-induced repression of Sp1 and TAFII250 was mediated
at the protein level. Pursuant to this finding, we examined the effect
of two proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and epoxomicin, on STG28facilitated suppression of TAFII250 and Sp1 expression. As shown in
Fig. 4B, MG132 and epoxomicin were able to protect against the
STG28-mediated ablation of these two proteins, underscoring a
mechanistic link between the repressing effect of STG28 and
proteasomal degradation.
Because proteasome-facilitated proteolysis is preceded by
ubiquitination, we examined the formation of ubiquinated Sp1 in
STG28-treated LNCaP cells expressing ectopic HA-ubiquitin
(Fig. 4C). Cells were exposed to 10 Amol/L STG28 in the presence

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

of 1 or 5 Amol/L of epoxomicin for 12 h, and cell lysates were
immunoblotted with Sp1 antibodies (input) or immunoprecipitated
by anti-Sp1 antibody-agarose conjugates. Equivalent amounts of the
immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting
with Sp1 or HA antibodies. As shown, epoxomicin not only rescued
Sp1 from STG28-mediated degradation (input) but also increased
the extent of Sp1 ubiquitination as indicated by a complex ladder of
ubiquinated Sp1 bands (IP, anti-Sp1; WB, anti-HA; Fig. 4C, right).
Sp1 siRNA mimics the effect of troglitazone and derivatives
on AR repression in LNCaP cells. To discern the involvement of
TAFII250, cyclin D1, and Sp1 in STG28-induced transcriptional
repression of AR, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown of
individual proteins to examine its consequent effect on AR
down-regulation. As shown, knockdown of Sp1 expression reduced
AR mRNA transcription after 24 h of exposure followed by a
decrease in AR protein expression at 48 h (Fig. 5A). It is also
noteworthy that siRNA-mediated Sp1 knockdown was accompanied by a transient increase in TAFII250 expression.

Suppression of AR Expression by Troglitazone

In contrast to Sp1, siRNA-induced knockdown of cyclin D1 and
TAFII250 exhibited a differential effect on AR mRNA and protein
expression (i.e., decrease in cyclin D1 expression caused a marked
increase in AR expression; Fig. 5B and C), whereas that of TAFII250
induced a modest elevation in AR mRNA and protein levels. These
findings argued against the involvement of these two proteins in
STG28-mediated AR transcriptional repression.
Ectopic Sp1 expression confers resistance to STG28mediated AR transcriptional repression. To validate the
mechanistic link between Sp1 down-regulation and STG28facilitated AR repression, we examined the effect of ectopic Sp1
expression on rescuing the drug-induced AR down-regulation.
Transient transfection of LNCaP cells with the pCMVSp1 plasmid
resulted in 1.8- and 2.8-fold higher expression levels of Sp1 and AR,

respectively, than those of the pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6A).
Treatment of both types of transfected cells with 10 Amol/L STG28
caused a 40% to 50% decrease in Sp1 expression (Fig. 6B). However,
as the Sp1 level in drug-treated pCMVSp1-transfected cells still
remained high after 48-h exposure, there was only a modest
decrease in AR expression levels in pCMVSp1-transfected LNCaP
cells compared with that of the control, indicating the protective
effect of ectopic Sp1 expression on STG28-mediated AR repression.
Pursuant to this finding, we examined the effect of ectopic Sp1
expression on rescuing the suppression of AR promoter-luciferase
activity by STG28 (Fig. 6C). LNCaP cells were cotransfected with
the AR promoter-luciferase plasmid in combination with the
pCMVSp1 plasmid or the pcDNA plasmid (control) via nucleofection and exposed to STG28 (10 Amol/L) or DMSO vehicle in 10%

Figure 5. Effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sp1
(A), cyclin D1 (B ), and TAFII250 (C ) on the suppression
of AR mRNA and protein expression in LNCaP cells.
LNCaP cells were transfected with the indicated doses of
the sequence-specific duplex siRNA oligonucleotide as
described in Materials and Methods. After transfection,
LNCaP cells were incubated in 10% FBS-supplemented
RPMI 1640 for additional 24 or 48 h, collected, and
subjected to Western blot and RT-PCR analyses as
indicated. The values in percentage denote the relative
intensity of protein or mRNA bands of drug-treated
samples to that of the respective DMSO vehicle-treated
control after being normalized to the respective internal
reference h-actin. Each value represents the average
of two independent experiments.

10 Amol/L STG28 on the protein expression levels
of Sp1 and AR in pCMVSp1-transfected versus

transiently transfected with individual plasmids,
incubated for 48 h, and exposed to 10 Amol/L STG28
in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 for the
indicated intervals. Cell lysates were subjected to
Western blot analysis with anti-Sp1 and anti-AR
antibodies. The values in percentage denote the
relative intensity of protein bands of drug-treated
samples to that of the respective DMSO
vehicle-treated control after being normalized to the
respective internal reference h-actin. Each value
represents the average of two independent
experiments. C, effect of ectopic Sp1 expression on
rescuing STG28-mediated suppression of AR
promoter activity. LNCaP cells were cotransfected
with pGLC3-luciferase reporter plasmid linked to AR
promoter (AR-Luc ) in combination with pCMV-Sp1
expression plasmid or the control vector pcDNA for
48. In each transfection, the HSV thymidine
kinase promoter-driven R. reniformis luciferase was
cotransfected to monitor transfection efficacy.
The transfected cells were treated with DMSO
vehicles or 10 Amol/L STG28 in 10%
FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 for 24 h. Cell lysates
were subjected to Western blot analysis with
anti-Sp1 antibodies (left) or analyzed for luciferase
activity (right ). The values in percentage denote the
relative intensities of protein bands of drug-treated
samples to that of the respective DMSO-treated
control. Each value represents the average of three
independent experiments. The luciferase activity
was normalized to R. reniformis luciferase. Columns,
mean (n = 3); bars, SD.

FBS-supplemented medium for 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for
Sp1 expression by Western blotting (Fig. 6C, left) or for luciferase
activity (Fig. 6C, right). As shown, the activity of AR promoter in
pCMVSp1-transfected cells was substantially higher than those of
pcDNA-transfected cells due to ectopic Sp1 expression (labeled as
DMSO). Although STG28 caused a 65% decrease in Sp1 expression
in both types of transfected cells, there was still a significant higher
level of Sp1 expression, associated with a higher AR promoterluciferase activity (P < 0.001), in pCMVSp1-transfected cells than
those of pcDNA-transfected cells. Together, these data confirm the
pivotal role of Sp1 in STG28-mediated AR transcriptional
repression.

Discussion
Although PPARg signaling plays a key role in regulating prostate
epithelial differentiation and proliferation (28, 29), a growing body
of evidence suggests that the antitumor effect of troglitazone might
be dissociated from its original pharmacologic activity [i.e., PPARg
activation (16, 25, 30–39). In our laboratory, we have identified
several ‘‘off-target’’ mechanisms that underlie the antiproliferative
activities of troglitazone, including Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition (39),

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

proteasome-mediated proteolysis of cyclin D1 (25), and transcriptional repression of PSA (16). In the course of our investigation of
the effect of troglitazone and D2TG on PSA repression, we found
that these agents could also down-regulate AR expression at doses
substantially higher than that required for PSA (16). Pursuant to
this finding, the mechanism by which troglitazone and its PPARginactive analogues suppressed AR expression represents the focus
of this study. We obtained several lines of evidence that troglitazone
and its PPARg-inactive derivatives mediated transcriptional
repression of AR by facilitating ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
degradation of Sp1. Although TAFII250 and cyclin D1 were also
subjected to this drug-induced proteolysis, the siRNA data dispute
the direct involvement of these regulatory proteins in STG28induced AR repression.
Among the three thiazolidinediones examined, the relative
potency of individual agents to mediate ubiquitin-dependent
proteasomal degradation of Sp1 paralleled that of cyclin D1 (i.e.,
STG > D2TG > troglitazone). This finding suggests that the druginduced proteolysis of Sp1 and cyclin D1 might be mediated by the
same ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, how these smallmolecule agents facilitate ubiquitination remains to be delineated.
In the literature, the Skp1/Cul/F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase has

been implicated in the degradation of cell cycle regulatory
proteins, including cyclins and a series of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors (40). Moreover, recent reports indicate that the histone
deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A repressed cyclin D1 and
estrogen receptor a expression by up-regulating Skp2, a F-box
protein of the SCF complex (41, 42). In contrast, the control of Sp1
degradation is largely unknown. Based on the finding that Sp1 is
rapidly degraded by proteasome in glucose-starved and cAMPstimulated cells (43–45), it has been postulated that Sp1
degradation might be part of the cellular response to nutrient
deprivation and stress (45). From a mechanistic perspective,
troglitazone and derivatives represent the first class of pharmacologic agents that allow the probing of the intracellular process of
the proteasomal degradation of Sp1. In light of the involvement of
the SCF complex in this proteolysis of cyclin D1, the mechanistic
link between this ubiquitin E3 ligase system and STG28-mediated
Sp1 degradation is currently under investigation.
Also noteworthy is the translational relevance of these findings
in developing therapeutic agents for prostate cancer treatment. In
the literature, many natural product-based agents have been
reported to suppress AR expression/function through different
mechanisms, including resveratrol (10), vitamin E succinate (12),

( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG; ref. 11), genistein (46),
quercetin (13, 47), and the curcumin derivative JC-15 (3). For
example, quercetin attenuated AR function by causing changes in
the post-translational modification of AR protein (13), whereas
EGCG could decrease the expression and transactivation activity
of Sp1 (11). The mode of action of troglitazone and derivatives in
AR repression seems to differ from that of the natural product
agents. Moreover, the differential ability of troglitazone, D2TG,
and STG28 to facilitate proteasomal degradation of Sp1 provides a
proof of principle to continue the structural optimization of
STG28 to develop potent AR-ablative agents, which is currently
under way.
