REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ nuclear receptors regulate several physiological processes, including circadian rhythm and metabolism.
A previous study reported the REV-ERBα gene to be co-overexpressed with ERBB2 in breast cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, we found
that several tumor types, including a number of breast cancer cell lines, predominantly express the REV-ERBβ variant. This pattern
was independent of ERBB2 and ER status, and opposite to that of non-cancer mammary epithelial HMEC cells, in which REV-ERBα
was the major variant. Consistent with this molecular proﬁle, REV-ERB target genes in both circadian and metabolic pathways were
derepressed upon silencing of REV-ERBβ, but not REV-ERBα. Strikingly, we found that REV-ERBβ is a determinant of sensitivity to
chloroquine, a clinically relevant lysosomotropic agent that suppresses autophagy. The cytoprotective function of REV-ERBβ
appears to operate downstream of autophagy blockade. Through compound screening, we identiﬁed ARN5187, a novel
lysosomotropic REV-ERBβ ligand with a dual inhibitory activity toward REV-ERB-mediated transcriptional regulation and autophagy.
Remarkably, although ARN5187 and chloroquine share similar lysosomotropic potency and have a similar effect on autophagy
inhibition, ARN5187 is signiﬁcantly more cytotoxic. Collectively, our results reveal that dual inhibition of REV-ERBβ and autophagy is
an effective strategy for eliciting cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Furthermore, our discovery of a novel inhibitor compound of both
REV-ERB and autophagy may provide a scaffold for the discovery of new multifunctional anticancer agents.

INTRODUCTION
REV-ERBα (NR1D1) and its variant REV-ERBβ (NR1D2) proteins
belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which is composed of
large number of ligand-activated transcription factors. REV-ERB
proteins lack a transcriptional activation domain and repress
target genes bearing REV-ERB Responsive Elements within their
promoter.1–3 REV-ERBα regulates several processes, including
circadian rhythm and metabolism.2,4 In mice, REV-ERBα reportedly
confers robustness to the oscillatory clock.4 However, recent
studies revealed that the REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ variants
compensate for one another in the repression of common target
genes, indicating a more prominent function of REV-ERB proteins
in circadian regulation.5,6
Disruption of the circadian clock is associated with a variety of
human pathologies, including cancer.7–10 Accordingly, the expression of several clock genes is perturbed in many tumors.11–13
Aberrant clock gene expression in tumors likely has a causal role in
tumor development and survival. For instance, the incidence of
breast cancer is higher among women who predominantly work
nightshifts.9
REV-ERBα possesses a prosurvival function in ERBB2-positive
breast cancer cells,14 which is of interest as REV-ERB proteins are
proven druggable targets.15,16 In fact, pharmacological screening
identiﬁed the compound SR6452 (GSK4112) as a REV-ERB
synthetic agonist.17 Further studies identiﬁed several SR6452

analogs with optimized REV-ERB agonistic activity.16 The only REVERB antagonist identiﬁed to date is the compound SR8278.18
Although SR8278 is a useful probe for cellular REV-ERB activity, the
pharmacokinetic properties of this compound limit its pharmacological uses,18 underscoring the need for additional REV-ERB
inhibitors.
To determine whether pharmacological modulation of REV-ERB
proteins may be a viable anticancer strategy, we investigated
the contribution of both REV-ERB variants to the survival of
ERBB2-positive cancer cells by both molecular genetic and
pharmacological approaches.

RESULTS
REV-ERBβ is the major variant in cancer cells
Because REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ have redundant functions, we
ﬁrst determined the relative contribution of each variant to REVERB-dependent gene expression and to the survival of breast
cancer cells. We initially analyzed their transcript levels in BT-474
breast cancer cells, in which the REV-ERBα gene has been reported
to be co-overexpressed with ERBB2.19 Contrary to our expectations, the REV-ERBβ transcript was considerably more abundant
than REV-ERBα (Figure 1a), and represented more than the 95% of
total REV-ERB mRNA (Figure 1e). Notably, a different molecular
phenotype was observed in non-cancer primary human mammary

epithelial cells HMEC, in which levels of each variant were equally
represented (Figures 1a and e).
REV-ERB gene expression is under the control of the circadian
clock; we thus investigated whether this regulation also applied
in cells in which REV-ERBβ is overexpressed. Accordingly, we
analyzed the circadian expression proﬁle of REV-ERBα and REVERBβ in BT-474 and HMEC cells synchronized by dexamethasone
treatment.20 REV-ERB transcripts showed a similar oscillatory
pattern in both BT-474 and HMECs (Figure 1b). In HMEC, levels

Oncogene (2015) 2597 – 2608

of both transcripts peaked at CT26, where the relative REV-ERBα
expression became higher than REV-ERBβ. In marked contrast,
REV-ERBβ expression was higher than that of REV-ERBα at all
timepoints in BT-474 cells (Figure 1b). Furthermore, the peak of
both REV-ERB transcripts occurred earlier (CT20) when compared
with the HMEC circadian proﬁle (Figure 1b). Overall, our results
indicate that REV-ERBβ is the more abundant variant in both nonsynchronized and synchronized BT-474 cells. BT-474 belong to the
Luminal B subtype of breast carcinomas, which are generally

ERBB2 and ER positive.21 We thus investigated whether REV-ERBα
and REV-ERBβ expression was dependent on ERBB2 and/or ER. The
levels of the two REV-ERB transcripts were analyzed in BT-474,
SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells relative to
their levels in HMECs (Figures 1c and d). As reported,19 REV-ERBα

2599
levels were higher in ERBB2-positive (BT-474, SK-BR-3, MDAMB-361) than in ERBB-2 negative (MCF-7) cells (Figure 1c).
However, REV-ERBα levels were signiﬁcantly lower in all the breast
cancer cell lines versus normal HMECs. In marked contrast,
REV-ERBβ transcript levels were signiﬁcantly higher in all breast

Figure 2. REV-ERBβ overrepresentation corresponds to a preponderant functional role in REV-ERB-mediated transcriptional regulation. (a) The
expression of the circadian (BMAL1, PER1) and metabolic (PEPCK) REV-ERB-regulated genes was analyzed in BT-474 cells 72 h after transfection
with pooled siRNA sequences against REV-ERBα (siREV-ERBα), REV-ERBβ (siREV-ERBβ) and both REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ (siREV-ERBs), with a
non-targeting pool as a negative control (Control). Relative expression was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR)
using GAPDH for normalization. HRPT expression is reported as representative of a REV-ERB-independent gene. The effect of REV-ERBs

for qRT–PCR analysis to evaluate the expression of REV-ERB-regulated genes. The relative expression was determined using GAPDH for
normalization. HRPT expression is reported as representative of a REV-ERB-independent gene. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m., n = 3.

cancer cell lines analyzed when compared with normal epithelial
cells (Figure 1d). REV-ERBβ overexpression in cancer cells was also
conﬁrmed at the protein level (Supplementary Figure S1a).
Because relative copy number (Q) analysis22 indicated that the
REV-ERBβ locus is not ampliﬁed in cancer cells, REV-ERBβ
overexpression likely depends on a different transcriptional
regulation in cancer versus normal cells (Supplementary Figures

S1b and c). Finally, we observed that REV-ERBβ preponderance
was independent of both ERBB2 and ER expression (Figure 1e).
We next addressed whether REV-ERBβ overrepresentation was a
general feature of transformed cells, and found that REV-ERBβ was
the most highly expressed variant in liver (HEP-G2), prostate
(LNCaP) and melanoma (A-375 and A-431) cancer cells (Figure 1f).
In contrast, a colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116) expressed

comparable levels of each variant (Figure 1f). The REV-ERBβ/REVERBα ratio was also higher in immortalized/transformed embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells, in which REV-ERBβ mRNA accounted for
490% of total REV-ERB transcripts (data not shown).
To evaluate whether this REV-ERBβ abundance was a feature of
cancer cell lines, or rather was related to a human tissue-speciﬁc
expression of this variant, we determined the REV-ERBα/REV-ERBβ
ratio from the OriGene (Rockville, MD, USA) Healthy tissues cDNA
collection. This panel contains pooled cDNA from tissues of
multiple healthy individuals of different ethnicity. Remarkably,
this analysis showed that REV-ERBα is more abundant than
REV-ERBβ in various normal human tissues (Figure 1g and
Supplementary Figure S2).
Conversely, similar analysis in breast, colon, liver and prostate
cancer tissue cDNA acquired from OriGene, revealed that REVERBβ was highly expressed compared to the REV-ERBα variant in
the majority of tumor samples (10/12 breast tumors, 10/12 colon
tumors, 12/12 liver tumors, 12/12 prostate tumors, REV-ERBβ
⩾ 65% total REV-ERB; Figure 1h and Supplementary Figure S3).
Consistent with our observations in breast cancer cell lines, this
analysis also showed that preferential overexpression of REV-ERBβ
is not related to the ERBB2 or ER status of tumors (Figure 1h).
REV-ERBβ overrepresentation corresponds to its dominant role in
REV-ERB-mediated transcriptional regulation
Studies in rodents have shown that REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ
variants compensate for one another to repress a number of
common targets, including genes of circadian and metabolic
pathways.5,6 We therefore examined whether the REV-ERBβ
preponderance in cancer cell lines corresponds with a predominant functional role of this variant in REV-ERB-regulated gene
expression. Thus, we knocked down expression of REV-ERBα,
REV-ERBβ or both REV-ERB variants in BT-474 cells. Strikingly,
REV-ERBβ silencing signiﬁcantly enhanced the expression of
circadian and metabolic genes, whereas REV-ERBα silencing had
no such effect (Figure 2a). This result is consistent with a major
dominant regulatory role of REV-ERBβ in repressing REV-ERB
target genes. Consistent with the well-established feedback loop
in the circadian signaling network,23 we observed an upregulation
of the REV-ERBα gene following knockdown of REV-ERBβ. Indeed,
the derepression of the circadian transcriptional activator, BMAL1,
following REV-ERBβ depletion may account for the transcriptional
upregulation of REV-ERBα, which is a BMAL1 target gene. However,
as the basal level of REV-ERBα transcription is extremely low in

BT-474 cells, the increase in REV-ERBα was insufﬁcient to
compensate for loss of REV-ERBβ, and therefore did not reestablish repression (Figure 2a).
To rule out potential off-target effects of our small interfering
RNA (siRNA) experiments, we performed an alternative silencing
method (small hairpin RNA (shRNA)) that utilized non-overlapping
sequences. Supporting a predominant role for REV-ERBβ, the
expression of the REV-ERB-regulated targets BMAL1 and PEPCK
signiﬁcantly increased in shRNA REV-ERBβ cells, whereas negligible
changes were observed in shRNA REV-ERBα cells (Figure 2b).
Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 and HEK-293 cells, which
predominantly expressed the REV-ERBβ variant (Supplementary
Figure S4).
Our hypothesis is that the lack of target gene upregulation
upon REV-ERBα knockdown is related to its low abundance
relative to REV-ERBβ; consistent with this (and in contrast to
cancer cells) we observed signiﬁcantly increased expression of
REV-ERB-dependent targets in REV-ERBα-silenced HMECs, which
expressed similar levels of both REV-ERB variants (Supplementary
Figure S5). In addition, and fully conﬁrming the redundant
function of the two REV-ERB proteins in transcriptional regulation,
the depletion of both REV-ERB transcripts further enhanced the
expression of the REV-ERB targets in HMEC cells (Supplementary
Figure S5).
Overall, our results indicate that REV-ERBβ overrepresentation in
cancer cells underlies a major functional role of this variant in the
regulation of REV-ERB target genes.
We next assessed the contribution of REV-ERBα in REV-ERBβ
silencing to BT-474 viability. Unexpectedly, although REV-ERBα has
been reported to promote survival of these cells,14 we did not
observe a reduction of cell viability following knockdown of either
REV-ERBα or REV-ERBβ (Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S6).
REV-ERBβ inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of the
lysosomotropic autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine
Because derepression of the clock machinery can sensitize
cancer cells to an apoptotic stimulus,24 and REV-ERB proteins are
clock-repressor factors, we decided to test whether REV-ERBα
and REV-ERBβ inhibition enhanced the cytotoxicity of current
anticancer drugs. As ERBB2-positive BT-474 cells are particularly
resistant to cisplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel (Taxol) and
chloroquine,25,26 we decided to study the cytotoxicity of these
drugs in the presence or absence of the REV-ERB inhibitor
compound SR827818 (Supplementary Figure S7).

transfected with pooled siRNA sequences against REV-ERBα (siREV-ERBα), REV-ERBβ (siREV-ERBβ), both REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ (siREV-ERBs), a

evaluated at the indicated post-transfection times. (b) Concentration response plots of REV-ERB antagonist SR8278 cytotoxicity in BT-474 cells

Pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERB by SR8278 did not affect
BT-474 cell viability (Figure 3b). Notably, although co-treatment
with the REV-ERB antagonist had negligible effect in cisplatin-,
gemcitabine- and paclitaxel-treated cells (Figures 3c–e), SR8278
signiﬁcantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of the lysosomotropic
autophagy inhibitor drug, chloroquine (Figure 3f). To conﬁrm that
this was due to speciﬁc inhibition of REV-ERB, we evaluated
chloroquine cytotoxicity in REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ-silenced
BT-474 cells. Indeed, a subtoxic dose of chloroquine markedly
reduced the number of REV-ERBβ and REV-ERBα/β-interfered
cells (Figure 3g). Conversely, the knockdown of REV-ERBα did
not sensitize cells to chloroquine (Figure 3g). Consistent with
increased apoptosis, the percentage of caspase-positive cells was
signiﬁcantly higher in REV-ERBβ-silenced cells upon chloroquine

treatment (Figure 3h). This analysis also conﬁrmed a speciﬁc
cytoprotective action of the REV-ERBβ variant, since the percentage of caspase-positive cells did not signiﬁcantly differ between
REV-ERBα-silenced and control cells (Figure 3h).
Overall, our data indicate that chemical or genetic inhibition of
REV-ERBβ signiﬁcantly compromises viability in the context of a
CQ-mediated autophagy blockade. Consistent with this, knockdown of the essential autophagy gene ATG527 enhanced the
toxicity of SR8278, further demonstrating that REV-ERB inhibition
induces apoptosis when autophagy is genetically inhibited
(Supplementary Figure S8).
In mouse muscle, REV-ERB regulates the transcription of
autophagy-related genes, such as ULK-1 and BNIP3.28,29 However,
REV-ERB silencing did not affect the transcription of these genes in

BT-474 cells (Figure 3i). To further analyze whether REV-ERBβ
silencing affects autophagy in both basal and chloroquinestimulated conditions, we analyzed autophagy-related proteins
by immunoblot analysis in REV-ERBβ knockdown cells in the
presence or absence of chloroquine.
Consistent with the expression analysis, ULK-1 protein levels
were not affected by REV-ERBβ silencing (Figure 3j). REV-ERBβ
knockdown also had no effect on the levels of the autophagy
marker LC3 in untreated cells. Consistent with this, pharmacological REV-ERB inhibition did not affect LC3 levels (Supplementary
Figure S9a). As expected, autophagy blockade upon chloroquine
treatment increased the levels of the phosphatidylethanolamineconjugated LC3-II form and the p62/SQSTM1 protein, the
degradation of which is mediated by the autophagolysosome30
(Figure 3j). A similar level of LC3-II and p62 induction was
observed in both REV-ERBβ-interfered and control cells (Figure 3j).
Ruling out possible side effects related to prolonged chloroquine
treatment, a similar induction of LC3-II protein in REV-ERBβsilenced and control cells was also observed using a shorter
incubation time (2 h) and lower concentration of drug (25 μM;
Supplementary Figure S9b).
Overall, our data indicate that REV-ERBβ acts as a cytoprotective
factor downstream of a blockade of autophagy; the precise

molecular mechanism(s) underlying this prosurvival function
remain to be determined.
Identiﬁcation of a novel lysosomotropic compound with a dual
inhibitory activity toward REV-ERB and autophagy
Although the molecular basis of the cytoprotective REV-ERBβ
function requires more investigation, our results indicate that REVERBβ inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of chloroquine, a
lysosomotropic compound with relevant anticancer applicative
uses.31,32
A subset of lysosomotropic compounds share certain physicochemical properties, in that they possess a ClogP 42 and a basic
pKa between 6.5 and 11.33 Because several reported REV-ERB
synthetic ligands have a ClogP 43 and contain a protonable
amino group,16 we speculated that some novel REV-ERB inhibitor
compounds might also possess lysosomotropic properties.
Thus, we performed an in silico screen of a diverse and nonredundant set of approximately 15 000 molecules present in our
internal chemical collection (Figure 4a). An energy minimum
conformation of the REV-ERB synthetic ligand SR6452 was used to
generate Atomic Property Field (APF) potentials,34 setting the
presence of at least two protonable amino group as a constriction.
The members of the library were thus ranked according to the
Oncogene (2015) 2597 – 2608

Dual REV-ERB/autophagy inhibition in cancer cells

2604
generated APF score values. Of the 200 top-ranking compounds,
25% possessed a ClogP 43 and a basic pKa 47 and contained at
least one ﬂuorine atom, which facilitates sensitive ﬂuorine nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR)-based screening (FNBS).35 The 31 most
soluble molecules (solubility 4100 μM) were thus tested by FNBS
in the presence of the puriﬁed LBD of REV-ERBβ (Supplementary
Figure S10).
This lead to the identiﬁcation of ARN5187, a novel REV-ERBβ
ligand (Figure 4a). Indicating a direct interaction of ARN5187 with
the LBD of REV-ERBβ, the incubation of ARN5187 in the presence
of increasing receptor concentration caused line broadening and a
progressive decrease of signal on the 19F-NMR spectra (Figure 4b).
We then compared the lysosomotropic and cytotoxic effects of
ARN5187 and chloroquine in BT-474 cells. Although ARN5187
displayed a lysosomotropic potency comparable to chloroquine
(Figure 4c), it was signiﬁcantly more cytotoxic (Figures 4d and e).
We thus investigated whether ARN5187 cytotoxicity was due to
combined inhibition of REV-ERB activity and autophagy.
ARN5187 relieves REV-ERB-mediated clock transcriptional
repression
We evaluate the effect of ARN5187 on REV-ERB transcriptional
repression activity, using a RevRE reporter assay. A 24-h treatment
only modestly reduced cell number at the highest tested ARN5187
dose in both BT-474 and HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Figure
S10d). We thus adopted this time point for the analysis in order to
avoid the confounding effects of compound cytotoxicity.
Consistent with its ability to relieve REV-ERB-mediated transcriptional repression, ARN5187 activated the RevRE reporter in a
concentration-dependent manner, whereas no change was
observed with the control compound (Figure 5a). Supporting
the speciﬁcity of our assay for REV-ERB-mediated transcription,
ARN5187 did not alter the activity of a reporter bearing a mutated
RevRE that is not recognized by the REV-ERB DNA binding
domain1 (Figure 5b). Analogous to other synthetic REV-ERB
effectors,15 ARN5187 was not preferentially selective for either
REV-ERB variant (Supplementary Figure S11).
Notably, chloroquine had negligible effects on RevRE reporter
activity (Figure 5a), suggesting that the effect of ARN5187 on REVERB transcriptional repression was not related to its lysosomotropic properties.
To further demonstrate the REV-ERBβ inhibitory activity of
ARN5187, we tested its effect on reporter expression in REV-ERBβknockdown cells. Indeed, ARN5187 treatment increased luciferase
activity in the control, but not in REV-ERBβ-knockdown cells
(Figure 5c).
We then examined ARN5187 effects on the expression of
endogenous REV-ERB target genes in BT-474 cells. Consistent with
lysosomotropic-independent inhibition of REV-ERB activity,
ARN5187 signiﬁcantly enhanced the expression of BMAL1, PER1
and PEPCK in a dose-dependent manner, whereas chloroquine
treatment had no effect (Figure 5d). Collectively, these results
reveal a lysosomotropic-independent REV-ERB antagonistic
activity of ARN5187.
ARN5187 is a novel autophagy inhibitor
We next tested the ability of ARN5187 to inhibit autophagy and
observed a robust increase in LC3-II levels after treatment with
equimolar concentrations of ARN5187 or chloroquine (Figure 6a).
Furthermore, levels of the autophagy-associated protein p62
signiﬁcantly increased in either ARN5187- or chloroquine-treated
cells. Although both compounds produced a comparable increase
of LC3-II and p62, cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)
levels were signiﬁcantly elevated in ARN5187-treated cells
(Figure 6a), consistent with its higher cytotoxicity.
Owing to the complex transcriptional regulation of the p62
gene,30 we cannot exclude an autophagy-independent increase of
Oncogene (2015) 2597 – 2608

p62. Thus, the elevated p62 levels in ARN5187-treated cells do not
deﬁnitively demonstrate an autophagy inhibitory activity of this
compound. Nevertheless, the levels of proteins involved in the
initiation (ULK1), nucleation (BECLIN) and elongation (ATG3)
phases of autophagy were unaffected by either ARN5187 or
chloroquine treatment (Figure 6a). To avoid confounding side
effects related to the prolonged treatment, we repeated the
experiment with 25 μM of ARN5187 and chloroquine, and analyzed
the levels of LC3-II and p62 after 2 and 4 h. Consistent with our
previous analysis, ARN5187 and CQ similarly increased the levels
of LC3-II after 2 h (Supplementary Figure S12). LC3-II levels further
increased at 4 h. Although neither ARN5187 nor CQ signiﬁcantly
increased p62 levels at 2 h, both compounds generated a similar
induction of p62 after 4 h (Supplementary Figure S12).
These data support the hypothesis that ARN5187 blocks
autophagy at a late stage. To further evaluate this possibility, we
exploited the ﬂuorescence properties of an acid-sensitive green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) that can be quenched upon acidiﬁcation
in the mature autophagolysosome.36 BT-474 cells were transduced
with a chimeric protein in which an acid-sensitive GFP and an
acid-insensitive red ﬂuorescent protein (RFP) were fused to LC3. As
expected from an autophagy blockade at the late stage, the
number of GFP/RFP ﬂuorescent dots increased proportionally in
ARN5187- or chloroquine- treated cells compared with vehicle
(Figure 6b).
Because autophagy is a very dynamic process, the analysis of a
single time point is not sufﬁcient to rule out the possibility that
ARN5187 also affected autophagy formation and maturation. We
therefore analyzed the appearance of GFP- and RFP-positive dots
at different time points in ARN5187-treated cells. Consistent with
the idea that ARN5187 blocks autophagy by disrupting the
lysosomal function and preventing autophagolysosome ﬁnal
maturation, we observed a similar accumulation of both GFPand RFP-positive dots over time (Figure 6c).
To further test this hypothesis, we used transmission electron
microscopy to detect the presence of autophagic vesicles and to
distinguish early autophagic compartments (autophagosomes)
from late autophagic structures (autophagolysosomes).30 This
revealed a robust increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles
in cells treated with ARN5187 or chloroquine compared with
vehicle (Figure 6d and Supplementary Figure S13). Clearly
indicating an inhibition of late-stage autophagy, the majority of
autophagic vacuoles were autophagolysosomes, as revealed
by the ultrastructure of their cytoplasmic content, including
membrane stacks and vesicles, which appeared electron dense,
altered and partially disintegrated (Figure 6d and Supplementary
Figure S13).
Collectively, our results indicate that ARN5187 is a novel dual
autophagy/REV-ERB inhibitor. Considering that the inhibition of
autophagy has very low cytotoxicity in several non-cancer cells,
including HMEC,37 and that REV-ERBβ seems to act as a
cytoprotective factor downstream of autophagy blockade, we
compared the cytotoxicity of ARN5187 in HMEC and BT-474 cells.
In addition, to extend our observations to non-breast cancer cells,
we also assessed the toxicity of ARN5187 in prostate (LNCaP) and
liver (HEP-G2) cells. We found that the compound had negligible
effects on HMEC viability, while it was equally cytotoxic in all the
cancer cell lines (Figure 6e).
DISCUSSION
Although circadian regulation is altered in several tumor types,
whether pharmacological targeting of circadian regulators is a
viable anticancer strategy remains to be determined. In contrast,
the efﬁcacy of autophagy inhibition in cancer therapy has been
well documented.31,38,39 Here, we provide the ﬁrst indication that

autophagy process may be a novel anticancer therapeutic
approach.
In cancer cells, we found that in marked contrast to normal
epithelial cells, REV-ERBβ is the predominantly expressed REV-ERB
variant (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). Our knockdown
experiments are also the ﬁrst to indicate that REV-ERBβ overrepresentation corresponds to a principal functional role of this
© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited

variant in the transcriptional regulation of REV-ERB target genes in
cancer cells (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S4). We observed
that the alpha variant is the prominent REV-ERB form in several
tissue types (Figure 1g and Supplementary Figure S2), consistent
with a previous report.40 Conversely, REV-ERBβ levels were higher
in the majority of tumor samples examined (Figure 1h and
Supplementary Figure S3).

Although REV-ERBβ does not seem to contribute to cancer cell
viability per se, our data indicate that it has a protective function
when the autophagy ﬂux of cancer cells is compromised (Figure 3
and Supplementary Figure S8). We did not observe effects of
REV-ERBβ silencing on autophagy markers under basal or
chloroquine-treated conditions (Figures 3i and j, and
Supplementary Figure S9b). This suggests that the cytoprotective
function of REV-ERBβ likely operates downstream of the
chloroquine-mediated blockade of autophagy. Further investigation will help to clarify the molecular mechanism behind this novel
REV-ERBβ cytoprotective role.
We also identiﬁed a compound, ARN5187, with dual inhibitory
activity toward both REV-ERB and autophagy. ARN5187 is
apparently a novel autophagy inhibitor that disrupts lysosomal
function, blocks the autophagy process at the late stage, and
reduces cancer cell viability (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure
S12). In addition, ARN5187 inhibits REV-ERB mediated transcriptional regulation (Figure 5). ARN5187 was more cytotoxic than the
clinically relevant lysosomotropic autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (Figures 4d and e). Our data support the view that the
stronger apoptotic induction of ARN5187 compared with chloroquine is mainly due to the dual inhibitory activity of this
compound with respect to both autophagy and REV-ERB function.
We suggest that this multifunctional REV-ERB and autophagy
inhibitor provides a scaffold for the discovery of new anticancer
agents. Further examination of the efﬁcacy and pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic studies of ARN5187 in vivo will provide useful
information on the potential of ARN5187 as an anticancer agent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
BT-474 (HTB-20), MDA-MB-316 (HT-B27), SK-BR-3 (HTB-30), HEK-293 (CRL-1573), A-375 (CRL-1619), and A-431 (CRL-1555) cells were acquired from
the American Type Culture Collection and the National Collection of Type
Cultures (ATCC). MCF-7, HEP-G2 and HCT-116 cells were kindly provided by
Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ‘Mario Negri’, Milan, Italy. BT-474 cells
were grown in Dulbecoo’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium High Glucose (4.5 g/l
D-Glucose) containing 4 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
0.25 mM sodium pyruvate. HEK-293 and A-375 cells were grown in
Dulbecoo’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium High Glucose containing 4 mM
L-glutamine, 10% FBS and 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate. MCF-7, H-1299,
HEP-G2 and HCT-116 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 containing 4 mM
L-glutamine and 10% FBS. A-431 cells were grown in Eagle’s minimum
essential medium containing 10% FBS and non-essential amino acids.
SK-BR-3 cells were grown in McCoy’s medium containing 10% FBS.

Reagents
Chloroquine (498%), SR8278 (498%), vorinostat (498%), dichloromethane, diethyl ether (Et2O), methanol (MeOH), 2 M HCl solution in
Et2O and sodium triacetoxyborohydride [NaBH(OAc)3] were acquired from
Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy. For the initial screening, ARN5187 (CAS
n. 1287451-26-6) was acquired from Asinex (Moscow, Russia). ARN5187
was re-synthesized as hydrochloride salt with purity 499.5%.

Synthesis of 4-[[[1-(2-Fluorophenyl)cyclopentyl]-amino]methyl]-2[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]phenol-trihydrochloride
(ARN5187)
ARN5187 was resynthesized by reductive amination between 1-(2ﬂuorophenyl)cyclopentanamine (1.0 equiv.) and 4-hydroxy-3-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]benzaldehyde (1.0 equiv.), which were obtained by
chemical synthesis according to the procedures described elsewhere.41
The free base (60.0 mg, 0.15 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane
(1.5 ml) and 2.0 M HCl solution in Et2O (1.5 ml, 3.0 mmol, 20.0 equiv.) was
added observing the formation of precipitate. Excess solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and the resulting solid was triturated with Et2O,
then dissolved in a solution of CH3CN/H2O (1:1) and lyophilized.
Representative ultra performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and NMR spectra of ARN5187 are reported in Supplementary Figures
S14 and S15.

Computational methods
Calculations were performed using ICM v.3.7 (San Diego, CA, USA).
Molecular structures were prepared assigning three-dimensional coordinates to each compound. Each molecule was assigned the right bond
orders, stereochemistry, hydrogen atoms and protonation states at pH 7.4.
Merck molecular force ﬁeld atom types and charges were used. The
dihedral space of the template was sampled by means of the ICM
stochastic optimizer. Thoroughness and vicinity parameters were set equal
to 1.0 and 15.0, respectively. Fifty conformations were retained and
subjected to fully ﬂexible energy minimization. An energy minimum
conformation of SR6452 was used to generate APF potential maps as
described by.34 Grids covered the template plus a 5 Å margin. Each
molecule from the library was iteratively sampled in the APF grid
complement and its APF energy calculated.

Puriﬁcation of REV-ERBβ LBD
Human REV-ERBβ sequence coding for the LBD from aa377 to aa579 was
cloned in the pMAL-c5x vector (Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). The resulting MBP
fusion protein was expressed in BL21 cells and puriﬁed by afﬁnity
chromatography as described in Supplementary Figure S10.

NMR experiments
NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K with a Bruker FT NMR Avance III
600 MHz spectrometer (Milan, Italy), equipped with a 5 mm
CryoProbeQCI-1H/19F–13C/15N–D quadruple resonance with a shielded
Z-gradient coil. Compounds and protein were tested in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 138 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 8% D2O for the lock signal. R2 ﬁlter
experiments were recorded as described by Dalvit et al.42 with the CarrPurcell-Meiboom-Gill scheme with a time interval of 47 ms between the
180° pulses and with different total lengths. The spectra were acquired
with proton decoupling using the Waltz-16 composite pulse sequence with
a spectral width of 80 p.p.m., a 5-s relaxation delay, and 256 scans.
Chemical shifts were referenced to the CFCl3 signal in water.

REV-ERB luciferase assay
Two repetitions of the RevRE consensus (5′-AGA ATG TAG GTC ATC TAG
AAT GTA GGT CA-3′) or a mutated version (5′-AGC CCG TAG GTC ATC
TAG CCC GTA GGT CA-3′) that is no longer able to bind REV-ERB were
cloned in the pSV-40Cluc vector (Biolabs). For the assay, HEK-293 cells were
co-transfected with the reporters and a plasmid expressing a REV-ERBα or
REV-ERBβ. The following day, cells were treated with the compounds and
after 24 h luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A vector with an SV40 promoter-driven Gaussia
luciferase was used for normalization.

Relative copy number analysis
Relative copy number (Q) of ERBB2 vs GAPDH and REV-ERBβ vs GAPDH in
BT-474 and HMEC cells was calculated as described elsewhere.22 Primers
used for the analysis are reported in Supplementary Table S1.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR
RNA sample preparation and relative transcript expression levels were
assessed as described previously.43 GAPDH transcript was used for
normalization. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
For human tissue expression experiments, cDNA from OriGene Technologies Inc. was analyzed.

Immunoblot analysis
Protein samples were extracted in RIPA buffer as described previously.43
Antibodies and immunoblot conditions are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.

Transmission electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy studies, cells were grown on glass
coverslips. After treatment with ARN5187, Chloroquine or vehicle
(DMSO-d6), cells were processed as described elsewhere.44 transmission
electron microscopy images were collected by a FEI Tecnai G2 F20
equipped with a ﬁeld-emission gun operating at 80 kV of acceleration

voltage and recorded with a four Mp-Gatan-BM-UltraScan-Charge-Coupled
Device camera.

Lysosomotropy and cytotoxicity assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2000 cells/100 μl/well in culture
medium and incubated overnight. For lysosomotropy assays, 24 h posttreatment cells lysosomal staining was measured as described previously.33
For cytotoxicity assays, the percentage of cell number was evaluated
with the CyQUANT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). This method was
adopted because it is independent of cellular metabolic activity, which
may be affected by both REV-ERB and autophagy inhibition.
Caspase-3 and -7 activity induction was evaluated with the Image-iT LIVE
Red Caspase-3 and -7 Detection Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies).

siRNA and shRNA
Sequence information for siRNAs and shRNAs used in the silencing
experiments are listed in Supplementary Table S3. DharmaFECT 1 (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and Fugene (Roche Italia, Monza, Italy)
transfection reagents were used for siRNA and shRNA experiments,
respectively. Knockdown was veriﬁed by immunoblot analysis
(Supplementary Figure S16).

Statistical analysis
Log(inhibitor)-versus-response curves, one-way analysis of variance with
Dunnett’s post test and two-tailed t-test were performed using GraphPadPrism Software (San Diego, CA, USA).
