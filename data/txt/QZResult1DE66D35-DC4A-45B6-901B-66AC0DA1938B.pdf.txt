BACKGROUND: Primary systemic chemotherapy has been a standard of care for the management of
locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients and has increasingly been used for patients with large operable breast cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) of axillary lymph node metastases predicted an
excellent probability of long-term disease-free and overall survival. Although the clinical significance of
occult lymph node metastases in patients with breast cancer was extensively studied, their prognostic
value in patients with LABC after primary chemotherapy was not known. This study evaluated the detection rate and clinical significance of occult lymph node metastases in lymph nodes that contained metastatic carcinoma at the time of initial diagnosis and converted to negative based on routine pathologic
examination after primary systemic chemotherapy. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with LABC and cytologically involved axillary lymph nodes that converted to negative after preoperative chemotherapy were identified from 2 prospective clinical trials. All lymph node sections were reviewed, 1 deeper level hematoxylin
and eosin-stained section of each lymph node was obtained and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin (CK) was performed. A total of 762 lymph nodes were evaluated for occult metastases. KaplanMeier survival curves were used for calculating disease-free and overall survival times. RESULTS: Occult axillary lymph node metastases were identified in 8 of 51 (16%) patients. In 6 patients, occult metastases were
found in only 1 lymph node. In 7 patients, only isolated CK-positive cells were identified. In all cases, occult
carcinoma cells were embedded within areas of fibrosis, foreign body giant cell reaction, and extensive histiocytosis. Patients with occult lymph node metastases tended to have a higher frequency of residual primary breast tumors than those without occult metastases (4 of 8 vs 7 of 43, respectively). There was no
statistically significant difference in disease-free or overall survival times between patients with and without
occult metastases after a median follow-up 63 months. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent occult axillary lymph
node metastases were not uncommon in patients with axillary lymph node-positive LABC who experienced
a pCR in involved lymph nodes after preoperative chemotherapy. However, such occult metastases did not

KEY WORDS: axillary lymph node, breast cancer, cytokeratins, pathologic complete response, primary
systemic chemotherapy.

The presence of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases
is a very important predictor of prognosis in breast cancer
patients. The annual mortality rate of breast cancer
patients with 4 to 9 ALNs that are positive for metastatic
carcinoma is approximately 5 times higher than that in
those with negative (ie, uninvolved) ALNs.1,2 Although
randomized studies1-3 have not shown primary (preoperative) chemotherapy to be superior to adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy in patients with localized breast
cancer, primary chemotherapy does have certain advantages. For example, it has the potential to downstage
locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or large operable
breast cancer to allow surgery including breast conservation, and to provide in vivo information on the chemosensitivity of breast cancer in individual patients. In addition,
primary anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy completely eradicates primary breast tumors in approximately
23% of patients.3,4 Both pathologic complete response
(pCR) of the primary breast tumor and pathologic conversion of ALNs from positive to negative after primary
chemotherapy are strong independent predictors of
improved survival.4,5
Occult ALN metastases are present at diagnosis in
12%-20% of women with primary breast cancer who have
negative ALNs as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H &
E) staining during routine pathologic examination.5-8
Many studies have used additional H & E sections or immunohistochemical markers such as cytokeratins (CKs) to
identify occult ALN metastases. Other studies have used
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to amplify
and detect messenger RNA (mRNA) markers that are specific to epithelial cells.6-12 The prognostic significance of
occult ALN metastases is controversial, and the results of
the available studies have been contradictory.
The prognostic significance of occult ALN metastases in patients who have undergone primary chemotherapy for ALN-positive breast cancer and have
pathologically negative ALNs at subsequent breast surgery
1606

is even less clear. The pathologic conversion of ALNs after
primary chemotherapy from positive to negative is a
strong predictor of excellent disease outcomes.4,5 Indeed,
studies suggest that only 10%-20% of patients whose
ALNs undergo this conversion develop recurrent breast
cancer. However, the persistence of occult ALN metastases in these patients with pathologically negative ALNs after preoperative chemotherapy may predict an increased
risk of breast cancer recurrence. This would have important prognostic implications that could impact the further
management of breast cancer in these patients.4 We thus
analyzed the frequency and clinical significance of residual
occult ALN breast cancer metastases in patients who were
treated with primary chemotherapy for cytologically proven ALN-positive breast cancer and who were subsequently found to have pathologically negative ALNs at
surgery on routine histologic examination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1989 and 2001, 51 patients with LABC and
cytologically documented ALN metastases were treated in
2 prospective clinical trials of preoperative anthracyclinebased primary chemotherapy and were found to have
ALN pCR at the subsequent definitive breast surgery.
LABC was defined as histologically or cytologically proven
stage II or III breast cancer (2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer Classification).13 The initial diagnosis was
established by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of
the primary tumor and of clinically suspicious ALNs.
Each patient was examined by a multidisciplinary
team for evaluation of the clinical stage of disease at presentation and of disease response after 4 chemotherapy
cycles. Staging procedures included a complete history
and physical examination, complete blood count with
differential, blood chemistries, electrocardiography, chest
x-ray, abdominal computed tomography or ultrasonography, bone scan, bilateral mammography, and breast/
regional lymph node ultrasonography. Patients and their

follow-up data were added prospectively into the protocol
database. Complete medical records of all patients were
available for review at the time of this analysis.
A subsequent segmental mastectomy with ALN dissection or a modified radical mastectomy was performed
after 4 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. ALN dissection specimens from all 51 patients were examined using
routine H & E-stained sections and were found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma. Routine histologic evaluation at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center consists of submission of entire lymph node for
histologic evaluation. Paraffin blocks of ALNs that were
classified as negative after initial H & E examination were
retrospectively pulled from patients’ files under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol and subjected to additional evaluation. This evaluation included
obtaining 2 additional unstained sections, 1 of which was
stained with H & E. The second unstained slide was submitted for immunohistochemical staining for CK. This
level of sampling identifies the majority of cases with
occult metastasis.14 Sections were deparaffinized in 3 successive xylene baths and cleared in absolute ethanol. After
being washed with tap and deionized water, the slides
were soaked in a pH 7.2 to 7.4 buffer. Sections were then
loaded into a standardized, automated tissue stainer and
washed 3 times with buffer. Afterward, the sections were
subjected to protein blocking. Primary monoclonal anticytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3 [Dako, Carpinteria,
Calif]; Cam 5.2 [Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif];
Cytokeratin MNF116 [Dako]; and keratins 8 and 18
[Zymed, San Francisco, Calif]) was applied. The sections
were incubated for 30 minutes and then washed 3 times
with buffer. The link, label, substrate, and counterstain
portions of the assay were performed for 20 minutes, 20
minutes, 10 minutes, and 2 minutes, respectively. The
slides were then cover-slipped for review. Human skin sections were used as controls. Histologic features of cytotoxic therapy-induced changes were also evaluated in the
ALNs. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 is performed on lymph nodes with occult metastatic carcinoma
using MIB-1 antibody (Dako).

node group (positive vs negative staining for CK) and
compared using the chi-square, Fisher exact, or Wilcoxon
rank sum test, as appropriate. Disease-free survival (DFS),
disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS)
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
groups were compared with the log-rank test. There was
not a sufficient number of events to perform multivariable
analyses.
Using our DFS findings, we then calculated the predictive probability that, if an additional 500 patients
could be accrued, we would be able to conclude that the
patients with negative ALNs would have a better DFS
than patients with ALNs containing occult metastases.
Patients were assumed to enroll in the study according to
a Poisson process at the rate of 10 patients per month.
Once accrual was complete, we assumed patients would
be followed for an additional 5 years and that 15.7% of
patients would be LN-positive, as observed in the current
data. For a given patient (k) in 1 of the CK ALN groups
(j), we assumed the survival time (Xkj) followed and exponential distribution with mean lj. We assumed an inverse
gamma (IG) prior distribution for lj. The study was simulated 10,000 times under 3 different sets of prior distributions. In this scenario, using data and the DFS findings
from the limited number of patients in our current study,
the prior data was updated and future patients were simulated from the posterior distribution. At the end of the
simulated study, ALN groups were compared using the
log-rank test. P values <.05 were considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
CK immunostaining was strongly positive in the examined ALN sections of 8 of 51 patients (16%) with ALNs
that were negative for metastatic carcinoma on routine
pathologic examination. The tumor cells were predominantly located within the capsule and the lymph node parenchyma or, in 5 cases, embedded within areas of
fibrosis, foreign body giant-cell reaction, and extensive
histiocytosis likely related to chemotherapy. Of the 8
patients, 6 had occult tumor cells within 1 lymph node
(Fig. 1); the other 2 patients were found to have occult
metastatic tumor cells in 2 and 3 ALNs. In 1 patient, CK
immunostaining revealed a cluster of metastatic carcinoma cells measuring 0.35 mm in total size that was not

noted in the original H & E examination (Fig. 2). The
ALNs of the other 7 patients were found to have only isolated CK-positive tumor cells. Occasional dendritic cells
within the lymph node parenchyma were also positive for
CK. Ki-67 labeling of occult metastasis varied from 5% to
10%.
Patient characteristics by ALN group are shown in
Table 1. Patients with occult ALN tumor cells after primary chemotherapy tended to be younger, to achieve
pCR in the breast less frequently, and to have tumors of
lower nuclear grade than patients without occult ALNs.
However, no characteristics were found to be statistically
different between the 2 groups, likely because of the small
patient numbers. In 4 of 8 patients (50%) with ALN CK
positivity after preoperative chemotherapy, there was

residual disease in the breast, whereas 10 of 43 patients
(23%) with negative ALNs by CK immunostaining had a
residual primary breast tumor (P ¼ .19). In addition, 3
and 2 patients with positive ALNs by CK immunostaining after preoperative chemotherapy had tumors that were
positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), respectively, not significantly different from
the rates of ER and PR positivity in the tumors of patients
with negative ALNs as determined by CK immunostaining after preoperative chemotherapy (Table 1).
The median follow-up of all patients was 63 months
(range, 13-173 months). The Kaplan-Meier curves for
DFS according to ALN status as determined by CK immunostaining are shown in Figure 3. Five of the patients
with ALN-negative disease, and none of the patients with

ALNs that were positive for occult metastases have experienced a disease recurrence. The DFS rates at 60 months
were 87.8% (95% confidence interval, 78.3%-98.5%)
versus 100% (P ¼ .31), respectively. However, we had
only approximately 16% power to detect a significant
DFS difference between the 2 groups. Neither was there a
significant difference in DSS rates between these 2 groups
of patients (P ¼ .54). The 8 patients with positive ALNs
by CK immunostaining after primary chemotherapy had

a 100% DSS rate at 10 years while the DSS rate at 10 years
was 95% in the 43 patients with negative ALNs by CK
immunostaining (2 deaths related to breast cancer). The
results for OS were identical to those for DSS. These findings suggest, albeit in a limited number of patients, that
the presence of residual occult breast carcinoma cells in
ALNs after the induction of ALN pCR by primary chemotherapy does not have an adverse impact on the favorable
outcome associated with ALN pCR.

node (ALN) group (patients with negative ALNs vs those
with ALNs that are positive for occult carcinoma cells by cytokeratin immunohistochemistry).

The observed trend, although not statistically significant, toward a better outcome in patients with occult
ALN carcinoma cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
suggests that it is unlikely that we failed to find an adverse
prognostic effect of occult ALN metastases simply because
of limited patient numbers. To formalize this in statistical
terms, we used the data derived from the current study to
calculate the predictive probability that the ALN-negative
patients would have better DFS rates than the occultALN-positive patients if an additional 500 patients could
be accrued. In this scenario, we found a 19.2% probability
of concluding that the occult ALN -positive group would
have significantly better DFS rates, a 1.6% probability of
concluding that the ALN negative group would have significantly better DFS rates, and a 79.2% probability of
not detecting a statistically significant difference in DFS
rates between the 2 groups. Thus, although there are not
sufficient current data at this time to conclude with any
certainty that 1 group has better DFS compared with the
other, it is unlikely given the current data that a larger
study would overturn the current results and demonstrate
that occult ALN metastases after ALN pCR are actually
associated with an adverse outcome.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we found that 16% of breast cancer
patients with cytologically documented ALN metastases
at diagnosis who achieved an ALN pCR after treatment
1610

with primary chemotherapy actually had residual occult
ALN metastases. This rate is comparable to previously
reported rates of occult ALN metastases in patients with
histologically negative ALNs who were treated initially
with definitive breast and axillary surgery.15-18 We evaluated only 1 deeper level H & E and 1 immunohistochemistry slide. It is possible that evaluation of more
levels might identify additional cases. However, our previous study has suggested that evaluation of 2 levels identifies the majority of occult metastasis.14
The results of studies that have evaluated the
prognostic significance of occult ALN metastases in the
absence of preoperative chemotherapy are contradictory.6-8,11,12,19 However, a study by Reed et al8 analyzed
the impact of the size of the occult ALN metastases and
found DFS and OS rates to be inferior on univariate analysis in patients with occult metastases from invasive ductal
carcinoma that measured >2 mm. In the series of Reed
et al, 45 (12%) of a total of 385 ALN-negative breast cancer patients had occult ALN metastases. In 21 patients
(47%), the occult metastases measured <0.2 mm; in 16
patients (35%), occult metastases measured between 0.21
and 2 mm in size; in 8 patients (18%), the occult metastases were >2 mm. Of these occult ALN metastases, 9
(20%) were localized in the capsule, 14 (31%) in the subcapsular sinus and 22 (49%) in the parenchyma of the
lymph node. Hainsworth et al20 reported similar findings.
Cummings et al21 reported an inferior DFS in association
with occult invasive ductal breast cancer ALN metastases
measuring >0.5 mm. However, as mentioned, the results
of other studies are contradictory and report no survival
differences between patients with ALN-negative breast
cancer at diagnosis who did and did not have occult ALN
metastases.6,7
Occult ALN metastases were found after further sectioning and CK immunostaining in 16% of our patients,
frequently within areas of fibrosis, foreign body giant-cell
reaction, and extensive histiocytosis, changes all likely to
be secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our finding of
occult ALN metastases on further sectioning is not
uncommon and has been reported previously.22 We did
not find statistically significant differences in DFS, DSS,
or OS times between patients who did and did not have
residual occult ALN metastases after ALN pCR induced
by preoperative chemotherapy for cytologically-proven
ALN-positive breast cancer.

Furthermore, although our study was small, the
nonsignificant trend to fewer events in those patients with
positive ALNs by CK immunostaining makes it unlikely
that we would observe an inferior prognosis related to the
presence of occult ALN metastases in a larger study. In
our study, the largest occult lymph node metastasis was
0.35 mm. We did, however, observe a trend toward more
frequent detection of a residual primary tumor in patients
who had residual occult disease in ALNs after preoperative
chemotherapy (P ¼ .19). Consistent with this, we have
previously reported that the size of a residual breast primary tumor does not significantly impact the outcome of
breast cancer patients with cytologically documented
ALN metastases who are treated with preoperative chemotherapy and are subsequently found at definitive breast
surgery to have ALNs that are negative for metastatic cells
by routine pathologic examination.23
In conclusion, although it is not uncommon to find
residual occult ALN metastases in patients who have an
ALN pCR after preoperative chemotherapy as assessed by
H & E staining and light microscopy, the presence of
such occult metastases does not seem to impair the excellent prognosis associated with ALN pCR. Therefore, testing for residual occult disease in ALNs using additional
levels and CK immunostaining is not recommended in
this setting. Additional studies with increased patient
numbers are necessary to support these findings.
