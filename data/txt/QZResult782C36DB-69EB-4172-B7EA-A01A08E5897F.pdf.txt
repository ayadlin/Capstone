Abstract
The taccalonolides are highly acetylated steroids that stabilize cellular microtubules and overcome multiple
mechanisms of taxane resistance. Recently, two potent taccalonolides, AF and AJ, were identiﬁed that bind to
tubulin directly and enhance microtubule polymerization. Extensive studies were conducted to characterize
these new taccalonolides. AF and AJ caused aberrant mitotic spindles and bundling of interphase microtubules
that differed from the effects of either paclitaxel or laulimalide. AJ also distinctly affected microtubule
polymerization in that it enhanced the rate and extent of polymerization in the absence of any noticeable
effect on microtubule nucleation. In addition, the resulting microtubules were found to be profoundly cold stable.
These data, along with studies showing synergistic antiproliferative effects between AJ and either paclitaxel or
laulimalide, suggest a distinct binding site. Direct binding studies demonstrated that AJ could not be displaced
from microtubules by paclitaxel, laulimalide, or denaturing conditions, suggesting irreversible binding of AJ to
microtubules. Mass spectrometry conﬁrmed a covalent interaction of AJ with a peptide of b-tubulin containing
the cyclostreptin-binding sites. Importantly, AJ imparts strong inter-protoﬁlament stability in a manner different
from other microtubule stabilizers that covalently bind to tubulin, consistent with the distinct effects of the
taccalonolides as compared with other stabilizers. AF was found to be a potent and effective antitumor agent that
caused tumor regression in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model. The antitumor efﬁcacy of some
taccalonolides, which stabilize microtubules in a manner different from other microtubule stabilizers, provides
the impetus to explore the therapeutic potential of this site. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6780–92. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Microtubule stabilizers, including paclitaxel, docetaxel, and
ixabepilone, are highly effective in the treatment of many
solid tumors, however, innate and acquired drug resistance
limits their efﬁcacy (1–3). The search for new microtubule
stabilizers that can overcome these limitations has been
intense. The taccalonolides are a novel class of microtubule
stabilizers isolated from tropical plants of the genus Tacca.
Many of the cellular effects of the taccalonolides are similar to
all the other microtubule stabilizers in that they increase the
density of cellular microtubules and interrupt mitotic progression, leading to apoptosis (4). The most abundant naturally
occurring taccalonolide, A (Fig. 1A), is substantially less potent
than the other microtubule stabilizers in vitro with an IC50
value for inhibition of proliferation of 5 mmol/L (5), however, it

exhibits antitumor effects in animal models (6, 7) and is able to
overcome multiple mechanisms of drug resistance including
mutations in the taxane-binding site (4), the expression of
MRP7 (7), bIII-tubulin (7), and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) both in
vitro and in vivo (4, 7). Other cellular effects of taccalonolide A
that differentiate it from paclitaxel include its high cellular
persistence and the ability to initiate microtubule bundling at
the IC50 for inhibition of proliferation, whereas paclitaxel
requires concentrations 20 times higher than its IC50 (8).
Recently, potent new taccalonolides, including taccalonolides
AF and AJ (AF, AJ) that have IC50 values for inhibition of
proliferation of 23 and 4 nmol/L, respectively, in HeLa cells,
were identiﬁed (5). The potency of these taccalonolides is
comparable with paclitaxel and laulimalide, each of which has
IC50 values of 1 to 3 nmol/L in HeLa cells. AF and AJ cause
microtubule bundling in cells and robustly stimulate the
polymerization of puriﬁed tubulin, indicating for the ﬁrst time
a direct interaction of taccalonolides with tubulin (5).
Two major, nonoverlapping microtubule stabilizer-binding
sites on microtubules have been identiﬁed: the taxane site in
the interior lumen of the microtubule and the peloruside A/
laulimalide site on the exterior of the microtubule (9, 10). A
combination of methods mapped paclitaxel binding to a
pocket on b-tubulin in the microtubule lumen with contacts
at R282, H227, and V23 (10–13). Detailed binding and synergism studies demonstrated that overlapping, nonidentical
drug-binding sites exist within the taxane-binding pocket,
which allows chemically diverse agents, including paclitaxel,

Taccalonolides Covalently Bind to Tubulin

Figure 1. Effects of diverse microtubule stabilizers on microtubule structures. A, chemical structure of AF and AJ, which differ from one another at the C15
position. The structures of taccalonolides A and B are also included for reference. HeLa cells were treated with vehicle, (EtOH; B and G), 100 nmol/L
AF (C and H), 30 nmol/L AJ (D and I), 15 nmol/L laulimalide (E and J), or 12.5 nmol/L paclitaxel (F and K) and microtubule structures in interphase (B–F), and
mitotic (G–K) cells were visualized by indirect immunoﬂuorescence.

docetaxel, the epothilones, discodermolide, and the dictyostatins, to elicit similar effects on microtubule stability (14–18).
These drugs enhance microtubule stability by strengthening
lateral protoﬁlament interactions, often by inducing the otherwise unstructured M-loop on b-tubulin into an ordered
helical structure (19–21). Increased microtubule stability can
also result from stabilization of lateral protoﬁlament interactions on a-tubulin as seen for discodermolide, which does not
affect the M-loop (22). The multiple orientations and interactions of diverse compounds within the taxane pocket have
recently been expanded to include the covalent binding of
zampanolide/dactylolide to b-tubulin residues N226 and H227,
which also causes M-loop stabilization (21, 23). In addition to
the taxane site, the second major stabilizer-binding site of
peloruside A and laulimalide was mapped to the exterior of the
microtubule in a site containing residues F294, R306, N337, and
Y340 on b-tubulin (9). Although the taxane and laulimalide
sites are nonoverlapping, binding to either site initiates nearly
identical effects on microtubule polymerization and stability
(9, 24).

More recent evidence also demonstrates that some taxane
site–binding agents can also bind weakly to a low-afﬁnity
site near the microtubule pore that they may use to gain
access to the interior of the microtubule (25). The microbial
metabolite cyclostreptin, which covalently binds to T218 of
b-tubulin deep within this pore, was instrumental in the
characterization of this site, which is referred to as the
"gatekeeper" site (26). Cyclostreptin, which causes microtubule stabilization in both biochemical and cellular assays,
can also bind covalently to N226 within the taxane pocket
if it traverses the pore to reach the microtubule lumen
(27–29).
In this article, the biochemical, cellular, and in vivo antitumor activities of AJ and AF were evaluated. We determined that
they bind covalently to microtubules in a similar manner to
cyclostreptin. Striking inter-protoﬁlament stability that did
not involve M-loop stabilization was initiated by the covalent
binding of AJ to microtubules. The ability to covalently bind to
and stabilize microtubules sheds light on many of the distinct
properties of the taccalonolides, including their cellular

persistence, ability to overcome multiple drug resistance
mechanisms, and their potent in vivo effects.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HeLa cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)]
were maintained in Basal Medium Eagle and MDA-MB-231
cells (ATCC) were maintained in Improved Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium, both supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were passaged
for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation from liquid nitrogen.
Immunoﬂuorescence
HeLa cells were treated for 18 hours with vehicle (EtOH),
paclitaxel, laulimalide, AF, or AJ at the minimal concentrations that caused maximum G2–M arrest. The cells were ﬁxed
and microtubules were visualized by indirect immunoﬂuorescence techniques with a b-tubulin antibody as previously
described (4).
Tubulin assays
Tubulin polymerization was evaluated turbidimetrically
at 37 C in a SpectraMax plate reader with puriﬁed porcine
brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.). Tubulin (2 mg/mL) in
GPEM buffer (80 mmol/L PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mmol/L MgCl2,
and 1 mmol/L EGTA) containing 10% glycerol and 1 mmol/L
GTP was incubated with vehicle (0.5% v/v) or drug in a ﬁnal
volume of 200 mL. Cold-induced tubulin depolymerization
was evaluated by cooling the plates at 4 C or 20 C in a
commercial refrigerator or freezer, respectively. No freezing
of the reactions was observed. Effects on steady-state tubulin polymerization levels were analyzed by detection of
tubulin by SDS-PAGE of the soluble or pellet fractions after
centrifugation at 25 C.
Electron microscopy
Samples were collected from the tubulin assays described
above. Aliquots of the samples were taken 4, 11, 30, or 60
minutes after warming to 37 C as well as after chilling and
recovery and mixed with equal volumes of a 4% gluteraldehyde
solution. Microtubules were then mounted on 200 mesh copper grids, washed with a 10% cytochrome C solution, negatively
stained with 8% uranyl acetate, and visualized on a JEOL100CX
transmission electron microscope.
Cellular growth inhibition and synergism
Antiproliferative effects were evaluated using the sulforhodamine B assay as described previously (4). The synergism of
drug combinations was evaluated with CompuSyn software to
generate isobolograms and combination indices (CI) as
described by Chou and Talalay (30).
Drug binding, displacement, and stability
Puriﬁed porcine brain tubulin at a concentration of
20 mmol/L in GPEM buffer containing 10% glycerol and
1 mmol/L GTP was incubated with 10 mmol/L drug(s) for
1 hour at 37 C in a ﬁnal volume of 100 mL. After incubation,
the reactions were centrifuged at 20,000  g for 30 minutes
at 37 C to separate the bound and unbound drug. The pellet

6782

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

was resuspended in 6 mol/L urea, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8),
and 0.03% b-mercaptoethanol and heated to 80 C for 30
minutes. Drugs were extracted from the supernatant and
pellet fractions with ethyl acetate and detected using an
Agilent 6224 Accurate–Mass time-of-ﬂight (TOF) liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The quantity
of drug(s) in each sample was determined from a standard
curve generated using identical experimental conditions.
Each sample was evaluated in triplicate using MassHunter
Workstation software. Drug stability over time in pH 7 PBS
was determined by LC/MS.
Structural mass spectrometry
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) methods as described in detail previously (9) were used to
explore the conformational effects of AJ on microtubules.
Brieﬂy, 60 mmol/L bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton) was
assembled into stabilized microtubules using 1 mmol/L
GMPCPP as a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog and treated with
either 125 mmol/L AJ or docetaxel. Samples were then processed with a conventional HDX protocol and the resulting
peptides were analyzed by LC/MS on a Qstar Pulsar i using a
chilled LC apparatus as previously described (31). Deuterium
incorporation for each was quantiﬁed with Hydra (32), and
signiﬁcant drug-induced alterations of deuteration were determined from quadruplicate datasets for each state. The levels of
altered deuteration were color coded per peptide on segments
of microtubule structures (PDB 2XRP; ref. 33). Structures were
rendered in all ﬁgures using Pymol (http://pymol.sourceforge.
net) and all residue numbering is based on bovine sequences in
UniProt (a-tubulin: P81948, b-tubulin: Q6B856). The remaining
digests from the HDX analysis were depleted of deuterium at
neutral pH, and re-analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) on an Orbitrap Velos
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Peptides with signiﬁcantly reduced intensity upon drug treatment triggered a reanalysis of the digest, as
this suggested covalent binding of the drug, and new peaks
were sequenced with both collisionally induced dissociation
and electron-transfer dissociation, to identify the host peptide
and study the nature of the covalent interaction.
In vivo antitumor trial
Female athymic nude mice were maintained in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facility and provided food and water
ad libitum. A total of 3  106 MDA-MB-231 cells supplemented
with Matrigel were bilaterally injected subcutaneously into
each ﬂank. Mice were randomized into treatment groups
(n ¼ 5 mice, 10 tumors) and drug treatments initiated when
a median tumor volume of 60 mg was reached. The optimized
formulation of each drug was compared with untreated tumorbearing mice. AF and AJ were administered intraperitoneally
in 5% EtOH in PBS and paclitaxel in 5% Cremophor in PBS
with a total volume of 0.2 mL per injection. Tumor mass was
calculated using the formula: mass (mg) ¼ [length (mm) 
width (mm)2]/2. One-way ANOVA with a Dunnett posttest
was applied to determine statistical signiﬁcance between
control and taccalonolide treatment groups.

Results
Effects of diverse microtubule stabilizers on interphase
and mitotic microtubules
The effects of the new potent taccalonolides, AF and AJ
(Fig. 1A), on interphase and mitotic microtubules were
evaluated and compared with the effects initiated by paclitaxel and laulimalide. For direct comparison, the minimum
concentration of each drug that caused maximal G2–M
arrest was used. AF and AJ, but not paclitaxel or laulimalide,
caused bundling of interphase microtubules at their respective G2–M arrest concentrations (Fig. 1B–F). In addition, the
mitotic spindle asters formed by AF or AJ were more
numerous and compact as compared with those induced
by paclitaxel or laulimalide (Fig. 1G–K). These effects are
similar to those previously observed with less potent taccalonolides (8).

laulimalide over a range of concentrations (Fig. 2). In the
vehicle controls, a 9-minute lag period was observed before
initiation of tubulin polymerization, after which the rate and
extent of polymerization were monitored and normalized to
1. At the lowest concentrations that affected tubulin polymerization, paclitaxel (0.1 mmol/L) or laulimalide (0.25
mmol/L) caused only modest increases in the total microtubule polymer over vehicle-treated controls, yet they
decreased the lag period from 9 to 4 minutes (Fig. 2A, B,
and D). With higher concentrations of paclitaxel or laulimalide, a dose-dependent decrease in lag period was measured and polymerization occurred immediately after the
addition of 5 mmol/L of either drug with no measurable lag
period. In contrast, a lag period of at least 5 minutes was
observed with every concentration of AJ evaluated, including
those where the rate and extent of total tubulin polymerization were greater than that observed with any other
treatment (Fig. 2C and D). The persistence of a lag period
for polymerization was observed over the entire range of
AJ concentrations and is a property of all taccalonolides
with IC50 values for inhibition of cellular proliferation in the
low nmol/L range, including AF (5). This ﬁnding suggests
that the taccalonolides are not as efﬁcient at initiating

microtubule polymerization as compared with paclitaxel or
laulimalide.
The effects of each drug on the maximal rate of polymerization and the total tubulin polymer formed as determined from turbidity measurements were quantiﬁed. Dosedependent increases in both the rate and extent of tubulin
polymerization were observed up to 1 mmol/L paclitaxel or
5 mmol/L laulimalide where the total polymer and maximum rate did not increase signiﬁcantly with higher concentrations (Fig. 2A and B). For both paclitaxel and laulimalide, the maximum rate of tubulin polymerization was
approximately ﬁve times greater than vehicle-treated controls with a plateau of 2-fold greater total polymer (Fig. 2D).
Even though they bind to distinct sites on tubulin, the
almost identical effects of paclitaxel and laulimalide on
microtubule polymerization are consistent with previous
ﬁndings (24).
AJ also caused a dose-dependent increase in the rate and
extent of tubulin polymerization, with 10 mmol/L AJ resulting
in a 4.7-fold increase in the rate of polymerization over vehicle
and a doubling in total polymer formed (Fig. 2C and D).
Although these values are almost identical to the effects of
10 mmol/L paclitaxel or laulimalide, higher concentrations of
20 or 30 mmol/L AJ caused further increases (30%–66%) in both
the rate of polymerization and total polymer formed as measured turbidimetrically.
Because the tubulin polymerization in Fig. 2 was inferred
by turbidity measurements, it was important to directly
visualize the structures formed to determine whether they
were microtubules. The tubulin structures in the presence of
10 mmol/L paclitaxel, laulimalide, or AJ, which showed
similar effects on the rate and total extent of tubulin
polymerization (Fig. 2), were evaluated 4, 11, 30, and 60
minutes after polymerization was initiated at 37 C and

6784

compared with vehicle-treated controls. Electron micrographs show that paclitaxel and laulimalide caused a substantial increase in microtubule polymer within 4 minutes at
37 C, whereas the low number of microtubules formed in the
presence of AJ at this time point was not greater than those
observed for vehicle controls (Fig. 3). This is consistent
with the lag period observed during AJ-initiated microtubule
polymerization (Fig. 2C). The amount of microtubule polymer increased over time in all conditions in a manner that
was consistent with turbidity measurements (Fig. 3). No
major differences between the microtubule structures
induced by the three drugs were observed, even at higher
magniﬁcations (Supplementary Fig. S1). Microtubule structures were also observed at higher concentrations of AJ,
which were required to observe maximum polymerization.
Interestingly, the microtubules formed in the presence 30
mmol/L AJ did appear somewhat more rigid (Supplementary
Fig. S2), but how this contributes to the increased turbidity
observed in the presence of this super-stoichiometric concentration of AJ is not yet known (Fig. 2). Together, these
data show that although AJ is not efﬁcient at initiating
microtubule polymerization, it can enhance the rate and
extent of tubulin polymerization in a manner that is markedly different from either paclitaxel or laulimalide.
Differential effects of microtubule stabilizers on
microtubule stability
Microtubules are depolymerized by cold temperatures, as
indicated by the decrease in turbidity following incubation
of vehicle-treated microtubules at 20 C for 30 minutes
(Fig. 4A, dashed line). Although paclitaxel- and laulimalideinitiated microtubules are somewhat cold stable, this stringent drop in temperature caused almost complete depolymerization of microtubules formed in the presence of

However, once the vehicle-, paclitaxel- or laulimalide-treated
tubulin reactions were rewarmed to 37 C, microtubule
repolymerization occurred rapidly with kinetics similar to
the initial polymerization. In contrast, microtubules formed
in the presence of 10 mmol/L AJ were insensitive to coldinduced depolymerization and once the reaction was
rewarmed, a further increase in turbidity was observed (Fig.

presence of paclitaxel, laulimalide, AJ, or vehicle was conﬁrmed by electron microscopy at low (Fig. 3) and high
(Supplementary Fig. S3) magniﬁcation. These ﬁndings demonstrate a dramatic cold stability of AJ-induced microtubules and a propensity for increased microtubule polymerization upon rewarming. Electron micrographs show that
after rewarming, the microtubule structures induced by AJ
appear longer and that the microtubule density is greater
than that observed after the original polymerization (Fig 3,
bottom row and Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar effects were
observed for taccalonolide AF-induced microtubules (data

not shown), suggesting that resistance to cold-induced
depolymerization is a general property of the taccalonolides.
To further explore the cold sensitivity of drug-treated microtubules, less stringent conditions were used that caused only
partial depolymerization of paclitaxel- or laulimalide-induced
microtubules. In addition, the extent of microtubule polymerization was monitored by separation of soluble tubulin from
the microtubule pellet by centrifugation to more directly
determine the distribution of polymerized and soluble tubulin.
Consistent with the turbidimetric assays described above, at 10
mmol/L of each drug initiated a similar degree (75%–81%) of
tubulin polymerization after 30 minutes at 37 C (Fig. 4E, black
bars). After an additional 10 minutes of incubation at 4 C, little
microtubule depolymerization was observed in the presence of
any microtubule stabilizer (Fig. 4E, gray bars), but, as expected,
vehicle-treated microtubules were completely depolymerized
(data not shown). After a longer 30 minutes of incubation at
4 C, there was a 21% to 23% loss of paclitaxel- and laulimalideinduced polymer but no decrease in AJ-induced polymer (Fig.
4E, white bars). Extended cold exposure did not cause

substantial further loss of polymer for any condition (Fig. 4E,
hatched bars). Although these results conﬁrm reports that
paclitaxel and laulimalide impart some cold stability to microtubules, they further demonstrate that the cold stability initiated by AJ is more robust.
Because AJ-induced microtubules were markedly cold stable, their ability to resist mechanical disruption was also
evaluated. Under conditions of rigorous pipetting where vehicle-, paclitaxel-, and laulimalide-induced microtubules were
sheared into numerous short microtubule polymers as
observed by electron microscopy, AJ-induced microtubules
were not affected (data not shown). These studies demonstrate
that the taccalonolides impart robust stability to microtubules
that differentiate them from paclitaxel- and laulimalide-stabilized microtubules.

Synergism and displacement studies
Synergism studies have been useful in identifying compounds with nonoverlapping binding sites (34–36). The
ability of AF to cause synergistic antiproliferative effects in
combination with paclitaxel or laulimalide was evaluated.
Low antiproliferative concentrations of AF in combination
with paclitaxel or laulimalide caused synergistic effects as
determined by isobologram analysis and calculation of CIs
(30). Combination indices of 0.65 to 0.84 were found with AF
and laulimalide, indicating the two drugs act synergistically
(Fig. 5A). A lesser degree of synergism was detected with the
combination of AF and paclitaxel, with CI values ranging
from 0.84 to 0.95 (Fig. 5B). These ﬁnding suggested the
possibility that the taccalonolides might bind to a site that
is pharmacologically distinct from the two major stabilizer-

Taccalonolides Covalently Bind to Tubulin

binding sites on tubulin and biochemical studies were
initiated to test this possibility.
Displacement studies were conducted to determine whether
the taccalonolides could compete with paclitaxel or laulimalide binding to microtubules. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to detect drugs in the microtubule-containing
pellet or residual supernatant after incubation with puriﬁed
tubulin and compared with the total amount of drug detected
in the absence of tubulin. As expected, when 10 mmol/L of
paclitaxel was incubated with 10 mmol/L of a/b-tubulin,
essentially no drug was detected in the supernatant and
99% was extracted from the microtubule pellet (Fig. 5C and
F). In contrast, AJ was undetectable in the microtubule pellet
under the same conditions, even though only 7% of the drug
remained in the supernatant (Fig. 5D). We hypothesized that
the inability to detect signiﬁcant levels of AJ in either fraction
was a result of a tight interaction between AJ and microtubules
that was not amenable to extraction with organic solvents.
More stringent extractions of the microtubule pellet with a
variety of detergents, proteases, and heat were unable to
liberate AJ from the microtubule pellet, indicating the possibility of a covalent interaction of AJ with microtubules. Because
of its inability to be extracted from the microtubule pellet,
the percentage of bound AJ to microtubules was estimated
on the basis of depletion of AJ from the supernatant using a
standard curve (Fig. 5G).
To measure drug displacement, equimolar combinations of
laulimalide, paclitaxel, and AJ were incubated with tubulin and
the percentage of each drug present in the microtubule pellet
was calculated. When laulimalide was incubated with tubulin
alone, 93% was bound to microtubules (Fig. 5E). As expected,
the percentage of laulimalide bound to the pellet was not
decreased with paclitaxel coincubation as they bind to nonoverlapping sites. AJ was unable to displace laulimalide whether it was added simultaneously or before laulimalide (Fig. 5E)
and conversely laulimalide was unable to displace AJ (Fig. 5G),
indicating that these two drugs do not compete for binding to
microtubules.
Similarly, paclitaxel was unable to be displaced from microtubules by laulimalide, but docetaxel was able to inhibit
paclitaxel binding by 50%, consistent with their ability to
competitively bind to the taxane site (Fig. 5F). When AJ was
added simultaneously with paclitaxel in equimolar concentrations, the percentage of paclitaxel associated with the microtubule pellet decreased by 38%, indicating that AJ inhibited
paclitaxel binding, although to a lesser extent than docetaxel
(Fig. 5F). Given the inhibition of paclitaxel binding by AJ, it was
surprising to ﬁnd that the converse was not true; the distribution of AJ was not affected by paclitaxel (Fig. 5G).
On the basis of the assumption that the binding of AJ to
microtubules was irreversible and that this property may
contribute to its inability to be displaced by paclitaxel, the
effect of the order of drug addition on binding was tested.
When AJ was added to tubulin 30 minutes before paclitaxel, the
percentage of paclitaxel associated with the microtubule pellet
decreased by 59% (Fig. 5F). Together, these results demonstrate that AJ inhibits paclitaxel binding, but not laulimalide
binding and that neither paclitaxel nor laulimalide affected AJ

www.aacrjournals.org

binding. Although these data are consistent with some competition for microtubule binding between paclitaxel and AJ,
the fact that the timing of AJ addition impacts the extent to
which it is able to displace paclitaxel combined with the
inability of paclitaxel to displace AJ suggests that the two
drugs interact with tubulin in different ways.
Characterization of taccalonolide binding by mass
spectrometry
Mass spectrometry was used to aid in characterizing the
interaction between the taccalonolides with tubulin/microtubules and determine their impact on microtubule stability.
Peptic fragments of tubulin were generated in the presence of
AJ or docetaxel and detected by LC/MS using ion extraction
chromatography to identify peptides by their predicted mass.
Strikingly, the peptide containing residues 212–230 of b-tubulin was observed in the presence of docetaxel (Fig. 6A, blue
trace) but not with AJ (Fig. 6A, red trace). Because our binding
experiments suggested that AJ may covalently interact with
tubulin, the generation of peptide(s) conjugated to AJ was
explored. Indeed, a peptide with the predicted mass of b212–
230 linked to AJ was detected in the presence of AJ (Fig. 6B, red
trace) but not docetaxel (Fig. 6B, blue trace), conﬁrming that AJ
covalently binds to this peptide on b-tubulin. In addition to
b212–230, AJ was also found to bind directly to another, slightly
shorter peptic fragment, b213–230 (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The peptides to which AJ binds contain both the T218 and N226
cyclostreptin-binding residues and are distinct but partially
overlapping with the taxane site (Fig. 6C and D), consistent
with our displacement data (Fig. 5F). Therefore, AJ may bind to
one or both of the residues that interact with cyclostreptin or
another nearby residue. Unfortunately, the labeled residue(s)
could not be localized in this study because tandem mass
spectrometry using collisionally induced dissociation only
induced the removal of AJ as a neutral loss fragment, whereas
electron-transfer dissociation did not generate an informative
peptide sequence, only charge reduction. More complex follow-up studies to map the residue(s) of b-tubulin that directly
bind to AJ and model drug binding are ongoing.
In the absence of the ability to precisely map AJ binding to
tubulin, we used HDX-MS to further probe the allosteric effects
elicited by this covalent interaction as has been done for many
other microtubule-binding drugs (9, 19, 20, 22). A decreased
rate of hydrogen exchange demonstrates a lower accessibility
of residues to solvent, which is used to identify less ﬂexible and
more stable regions of a protein. This method was used to
demonstrate the effect of AJ or docetaxel on the stability of
microtubule peptides as compared with GMPCPP-stabilized
microtubules, which allows for differentiation of drug-speciﬁc
effects from those associated with general microtubule stabilization. Decreases in accessibility to hydrogen deuterium
exchange on tubulin residues in the presence of AJ are depicted
in red on a b-tubulin monomer (Fig. 6D, right) and in the
context of a larger microtubule fragment to show wider
allosteric effects (Fig. 6C, right). Because we could not determine whether the covalent binding of AJ to b213–230 directly
or indirectly altered the exchange properties of this peptide, it
was excluded from our analysis. The changes observed with AJ

binding were compared with those elicited by the binding of
docetaxel to microtubules (Fig. 6C and D, left). Although some
of the regions on tubulin that showed decreased exchange
upon drug binding are similar for the two drugs, there are
notable differences. The binding of docetaxel results in stabilization and therefore decreased hydrogen deuterium
exchange in the M-loop of b-tubulin as depicted in by its
representation in red (Fig. 6C and D, left), which is also the case
for most other microtubule stabilizers (19–21). In contrast, the
M-loop is not stabilized upon AJ binding, as shown by the lack
of red in this area (Fig. 6C and D, right). The stabilization of the
intradimer interface, involving helix H7 on b-tubulin, is also
observed with docetaxel and other stabilizers (37) but not AJ
(Fig. 6D). Rather, AJ induced a markedly higher stabilization of

in a manner that does not seem to involve the M-loop (Fig. 6C,

In vivo antitumor activity of taccalonolides AF and AJ
The distinct binding characteristics of the taccalonolides led
us to evaluate the in vivo antitumor effects of AF and AJ in the
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model. Initial dose
tolerance tests indicated that doses of 2 to 2.5 mg/kg AF
administered twice a week caused a dose-dependent, but
generally recoverable weight loss. For these antitumor trials,
the positive control, paclitaxel, was administered at 10 mg/kg
on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 for a cumulative dose of 40 mg/kg (Fig. 7,
ﬁlled squares). AF was found to have potent dose-dependent

antitumor effects with inhibition of tumor growth almost
identical to that of paclitaxel when the lower, 2 mg/mL, dose
was administered on days 1, 4, and 8 for a cumulative dose of 6
mg/kg (Fig. 7, open triangles). When a higher, 2.5 mg/kg dose,
was administered on days 1 and 5 for a cumulative dose of 5
mg/kg, complete inhibition of tumor growth and even measureable reductions in tumor size were observed (Fig. 7, open
circles). This is signiﬁcant because tumor shrinkage is rarely
observed in this model. However, it is important to note that
this dosing of AF also caused signiﬁcant weight loss and
represented the LD20 with one mouse succumbing to toxicity
on day 15, which was 10 days after the last dose was administered. These data indicate that AF has antitumor activity in
vivo with the potential to reduce tumor mass, albeit with a
narrow therapeutic window, consistent with the effects of less
potent taccalonolides (6, 7).
Following initial dose tolerance testing, antitumor studies
were also performed with 0.5 mg/kg AJ dosed on days 1, 3, 5,
and 8 for a cumulative dose of 2 mg/kg. This intense schedule of
AJ showed no indication of antitumor effects (Fig. 7, open
squares) despite the fact that an average weight loss of greater
than 10% was observed and 2 mice succumbed to toxicity on

www.aacrjournals.org

days 11 and 12. The fact that no measureable antitumor
activities were observed at the LD40 demonstrates that AJ does
not have a therapeutic window for antitumor activity. Followup studies to optimize the dose and schedule of AJ conﬁrmed
this as lower dosing regimens that minimized toxicity also
produced no antitumor effects. Modest antitumor effects were
observed with a dosing regimen of 0.85 mg/kg on days 1, 4, and
8 albeit with unacceptable toxicity that led to the LD80.
Although AJ was highly potent, causing notable weight loss
at doses 20-fold lower than paclitaxel, the lack of antitumor
efﬁcacy at doses lower than the LD80 demonstrated the
absence of any therapeutic window.
The fact that a small but notable therapeutic window was
identiﬁed for AF but not AJ prompted an investigation into
differences in chemical stability that might relate to in vivo
metabolism. Analysis of the chemical breakdown of both AF
and AJ showed very different chemical stability in aqueous
conditions; AJ showed marked stability in pH 7 PBS of over 20
hours, whereas AF had a t1/2 of 9 hours. Analysis of the
degradation products of AF indicated that AJ was the major
breakdown product. Given the high toxicity observed for AJ in
vivo and the fact that AF is rapidly broken down into AJ in
aqueous solution at physiologic pH, it is possible that the
toxicity associated with AF administration in vivo could be due
at least in part to its conversion into AJ. We hypothesize that
the identiﬁcation of taccalonolides that do not have this
liability of hydrolysis at C15 might facilitate the discovery of
a taccalonolide with a better therapeutic window.

Discussion
All microtubule-stabilizing agents in clinical use bind within
the classical taxane pocket on microtubules. Laulimalide site
agents, which show synergism with taxane-binding drugs
(24, 34, 36), are able to circumvent some clinically relevant
forms of taxane resistance in vitro (38–40), but have so far failed
to advance to clinical trials due in part to the lack of clear
antitumor effects in murine models (38, 41). We show that
paclitaxel and laulimalide have almost identical effects on
microtubule polymerization and stability despite the fact that
they bind to distinct sites on microtubules, which is consistent
with previous reports (9, 24). In contrast, AF and AJ have very
different properties, including a slow rate of microtubule
nucleation as evidenced by a persistent lag period for polymerization even at concentrations that eventually enhance the
rate, extent, and cold stability of microtubule polymerization
as compared with other stabilizers. These results suggest that
the taccalonolides do not stimulate microtubule nucleation;
but that once they are formed they are remarkably stable. This
ﬁnding is reminiscent of those obtained with cyclostreptin,
which causes weak tubulin assembly reactions with a significant lag period but enhanced cold stability (27, 42). The ability
of cyclostreptin to bind to b-tubulin residue T218 deep within
the pore of the microtubule has prompted references to
cyclostreptin as a "gatekeeper" for agents that require transport through this pore to gain access to the taxane site on the
interior of the microtubule (43). Similar to zampanolide,
cyclostreptin can also covalently modify the N226 residue in
the taxane pocket on the inside of the microtubule if it is able to

traverse the pore without becoming covalently attached (26).
Despite the robust literature detailing the biochemical effects
on tubulin (26–28, 42), the antitumor effects of cyclostreptin
have not been well characterized (44).
The ability of AJ to bind covalently to residue(s) in the 213–
230 peptide of b-tubulin is reminiscent of both cyclostreptin
and zampanolide binding because this peptide encompasses
both the T218 pore site and the N226 residue in the taxane
pocket. Although the identiﬁcation of the exact residue(s) of
b-tubulin that are covalently modiﬁed by AJ was not determined in these studies due to technical limitations, the allosteric effects on microtubule stabilization afforded by AJ
binding are striking (Fig. 6). It has been demonstrated that
the covalent binding of zampanolide to microtubules increases
the lateral interaction between protoﬁlaments by promoting
helical structuring of the M-loop on b-tubulin (21). In contrast,
the microtubule stabilization promoted by covalent binding of
AJ seems to cause profound interprotoﬁlament stability
through a distinct mechanism that does not involve changes
to the M-loop. Interestingly, it has also been proposed that the
binding of cyclostreptin to T218 is not anticipated to affect Mloop stability or tubulin polymerization and that its ability to
bind within the taxane pocket is what enhances microtubule
stabilization (45). The distinct interprotoﬁlament interactions
initiated by AJ indicate, for the ﬁrst time, that a drug can
covalently bind and stabilize microtubules independently of
M-loop stabilization, demonstrating that it interacts with
tubulin in a manner distinct from all other stabilizers that
have been previously characterized. Preliminary data indicate
that all taccalonolides that are sufﬁciently potent to enhance
the polymerization of tubulin in biochemical extracts bind
irreversibly to the resulting microtubule polymer, suggesting
that covalent binding of the taccalonolides to microtubules is
likely a general property of this class of microtubule stabilizers.
Further biochemical analysis is warranted to fully characterize
the interaction of the taccalonolides with tubulin.
The distinct allosteric effects imparted on microtubule stability by AJ shed insight into many unique properties of this
compound class as compared with other microtubule stabilizers. For example, it may facilitate the ability of the taccalonolides to cause bundling of interphase microtubules at antiproliferative concentrations, which is important in light of recent
evidence that suggests that interphase effects play an important
role in the antitumor properties of microtubule-targeted agents
(46). The covalent binding of the taccalonolides to microtubules
may also help to explain their potency in vivo. As observed for
other taccalonolides (6, 7), AF and AJ were much more potent in
vivo than would have been expected from their in vitro IC50s. For
example, paclitaxel has an in vitro IC50 10-fold lower than AF, yet
was administered at 5-fold higher concentrations than AF to
observe similar antitumor effects. This represents an effective
50-fold increase in in vivo potency for AF as compared with
paclitaxel, which is likely at least partially attributable to the
ability of taccalonolides to bind covalently to microtubules. This
would not be immediately reﬂected in an in vitro IC50 where the
cells are constantly bathed in the drug, but becomes evident in
vivo where nonbound drug is actively cleared. The high cellular
persistence of the taccalonolides in clonogenic assays after drug

6790

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

washout was the ﬁrst indication that their cellular effects were
irreversible (8).
The in vivo potency of AF and AJ, presumably initiated by
their covalent binding, also has the advantage of allowing
them to be administered in aqueous solvents without the
need for Cremophor or polysorbate-80, which can cause
hypersensitivity reactions. The covalent attachment of the
taccalonolides to microtubules also likely explains their
ability to circumvent drug resistance mediated by expression of the Pgp drug efﬂux pump, which limits the efﬁcacy of
many anticancer agents (4, 7). Indeed, in addition to the
taccalonolides, other microtubule stabilizers that covalently
bind microtubules, including cyclostreptin and zampanolide, have shown the ability to circumvent Pgp-mediated
drug resistance (23, 26, 28). Despite the potency of AF and AJ,
it is possible that the lack of antitumor efﬁcacy for AJ and the
narrow therapeutic window of AF and other taccalonolides
may also be due in part to irreversible binding. In addition to
identifying new taccalonolides with a larger therapeutic
window, an alternative strategy is to conjugate a taccalonolide to a tumor-targeting antibody. This has been successful with the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval of T-DM1 (47). The prospects of using this
strategy to speciﬁcally load a drug that irreversibly binds to
its target into cancer cells may be highly effective.
