Abstract
In addition to D-Glucose, D-Ribose is also abnormally elevated in the urine of
type 2 diabetic patients, establishing a positive correlation between the concentration
of uric D-Ribose and the severity of diabetes. Intraperitoneal injection of D-Ribose
causes memory loss and brain inflammation in mice. To simulate a chronic progression
of age-related cognitive impairment, we orally administered D-Ribose by gavage
at both a low and high dose to 8 week-old male C57BL/6J mice daily for a total of
6 months, followed by behavioral, histological and biochemical analysis. We found
that long-term oral administration of D-Ribose impairs spatial learning and memory,
accompanied by anxiety-like behavior. Tau was hyperphosphorylated at AT8, S396,
S214 and T181 in the brain. Aβ-like deposition was also found in the hippocampus
for the high dose group. D-Glucose-gavaged mice did not show significant memory
loss and anxiety-like behavior under the same experimental conditions. These results
demonstrate that a long-term oral administration of D-Ribose not only induces
memory loss with anxiety-like behavior, but also elevates Aβ-like deposition and
Tau hyperphosphorylation, presenting D-Ribose-gavaged mouse as a model for agerelated cognitive impairment and diabetic encephalopathy.

INTRODUCTION

community is higher than that of healthy elderly peers [4].
Memory loss in AD and the underlying
pathomechanisms have been widely studied. Many animal
models, in particular transgenic mouse models, have been
established to study memory loss, such as amyloid- β
(Aβ)-depositing APP-transgenic [5] and APP/PS1transgenic mice [6], neurofibrillary tangle-forming P301L
Tau transgenic mice [7], and the senescence accelerated
mouse-prone 8 strain (SAMP8) [8]. When the Tau and Aβ
pathology are combined in triple transgenic mice (3xTgAD), they display memory loss, anxiety-like behavior and
subdued social behavior [9]. The Tg-APP (Sw, V717F)/B6

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), at times referred to as
type 3 diabetes, is the most common form of dementia in
elderly people [1]. AD is characterized by an imbalance of
the cellular energetic metabolism, but the cause for most
AD cases is still unknown and less than 2.5% of all cases
have a genetic origin [2]. AD patients suffer from memory
loss, and other symptoms such as anxiety and depression
[3]. Studies show that 25-60% of AD outpatients display
anxiety symptoms. The proportion of anxiety symptoms

mouse also displays memory loss, anxiety-like behavior
and decreased motor coordination [10].
Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are key
features of the AD brain [11]. Plaques consist of insoluble
extracellular deposits of the Aβ peptide (Aβ) [12]. Tangles
contain aggregated forms of the microtubule-associated
Tau, which is hyperphosphorylated and accumulates
intracellularly [13, 14]. A lot of studies have been carried
out to search for risk factors in the production and
aggregation of Aβ and/or phosphorylated Tau (pTau) [15].
Mice do not develop senile plaques with Aβ deposition
even as they age, nor do they develop neurofibrillary
tangles [16]. They only develop plaques or tangles when
transgenic approaches are pursued as discussed above.
Here, we asked ourselves whether it would be possible
to nonetheless establish such a model simply by oral
administration of D-Ribose.
Since glycation has been found to be involved in
neurodegenerative diseases for instance AD, increased
attention has been paid to the role of glycation in AD
pathogenesis [17, 18]. The role is addressed of D-Ribose
in glycation because it has higher activity in glycating
proteins than D-Glucose [19, 20]. In vitro studies showed
that D-Ribose induces protein misfolding rapidly leading
to globular-like aggregations that are cytotoxic to neuronal
cells [21]. Intraperitoneal injection of D-Ribose for
30 days revealed high levels of glycated proteins and
advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the blood
and brain of wildtype mice. The mice also exhibited
impairment of spatial learning and memory [22]. More
recently, D-Ribose was found to be increased in the urine
of type 2 diabetic patients [23], suggesting that diabetic
patients may be suffered from metabolic imbalance of
not only D-Glucose but also D-Ribose [24]. Therefore,
we rationalized that the role of D-Ribose in glycation and
diabetic complications, for instance encephalopathy [25],
should be investigated.
D-Ribose is a key component of many important
biomolecules including RNA, ATP and Riboflavin [26-28].
Many foods, such as wheat bran, eggs, meat, cheese and
yeast, contain reasonable high concentrations of RNA and
riboflavin. The pentose phosphate pathway can convert
hexose to D-Ribose. Besides food, D-Ribose is orally
administered to improve athletic performance and the
ability to exercise by boosting muscle energy as a readily
available source of energy. It is also used to improve
symptoms of diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome,
fibromyalgia and coronary artery disease [29, 30]. To
mimic the effects the intake of D-Ribose has in humans,
complementary studies should be carried out in animals.
In the current study, we observed that longterm (6 months) gavage of D-Ribose at two different
concentrations caused memory loss and anxiety-related
behaviors, accompanied by Aβ-like deposition and Tau
hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus and cortex.
Therefore, the accumulation of D-Ribose and its metabolic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

imbalance should be considered in the study of diabetic
encephalopathy and age-related cognitive impairment or
when a high dose of D-Ribose is used for long term energy
supply.

RESULTS
No significant differences in body weights and
motor abilities between experimental group and
normal control
Based on Han and colleagues [22], D-Ribose
administration through intraperitoneal injection impairs
spatial learning and memory in mice. We wondered
whether oral administration of D-Ribose would also affect
cognitive function. First, C57BL/6J wildtype mice were
gavaged with D-Ribose (low dose 0.375 g/kg·d and high
dose 3.75 g/kg·d), D-Glucose (low dose 0.45 g/kg·d and
high dose 4.5 g/kg·d) or saline as control for 6 months.
None of the treatment groups showed any overt visual
abnormalities. There was no difference in weight gain
between the groups (Supplementary Table 1, n = 12, P >
0.05).
Second, to exclude the interference of motor abilities
on the behavioral tests, we measured the muscle strength
in the sugar-gavaged groups compared with the normal
control group. No significant difference (n = 12, P > 0.05)
was observed in the forelimb grip strength (Supplementary
Figure 1a).
Third, to examine motor coordination, mice were
allowed to perform the Rotarod test. D-Ribose-gavaged,
D-Glucose-gavaged and normal mice showed similar
latencies (Supplementary Figure 1b, n=12, P > 0.05).
This demonstrates that D-Ribose- and D-Glucose-treated
mice do not display any abnormal motor coordination and
muscle strength compared to untreated mice.

Oral administration of D-Ribose declining spatial
learning and memory
To determine whether oral administration of
D-Ribose affects learning and memory of mice, the
Y maze spontaneous alteration test as described [31]
and the Morris water maze were performed (Figure 1).
D-Ribose-treated mice (3.75 g/kg·d) showed significantly
less alteration compared with other experimental groups
and normal control (Figure 1a, n = 12, P = 0.0001). Total
arm entries did not differ (data not shown). According
to Stewart and colleagues [32], a high dose of D-Ribose
administration declines memory functions in mice.
We next used a more robust test of spatial memory,
the Morris water maze. Before the test, we confirmed
that there was no overt phenotypical difference between

= 12, P > 0.05). During the training sessions, all mice
improved their performance as indicated by increasingly
shorter escape latencies over successive days. Mice from
each treatment group had similar levels of performance
(no significant individual effect was observed in the first
three trials on day 1, n = 12, P > 0.05) prior to the test.
The escape latency of mice treated with D-Ribose (3.75
g/kg·d) on day 5 and 6 was higher than that of the control
group (n = 12, P = 0.0075, P = 0.0248). However, there
was no significant difference between the control group
and the three groups employed (Figure 1b, n = 12, P >
0.05).

D-Glucose (0.45 and 4.5 g/kg·d), using saline as control. The percentage of alteration in the Y maze was used to measure the exploration

D-Ribose-gavaged mice showing anxiety-like
behaviors

(Figure 2a). To determine whether both D-Ribose- and
D-Glucose-treated mice suffer from anxiety, the time of
the mice spent in the open arms was also measured (Figure
2b). A significant reduction in time spent in the open arms
was found for D-Ribose (0.375 g/kg·d and 3.75 g/kg·d)treated mice (n = 12, P = 0.0268, P = 0.0068), but not
the D-Glucose-treated mice. Furthermore, the number of
head-dipping below the maze was significantly reduced
in the D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)-treated mice (n = 12, P =
0.0246) (Figure 2c). No effect was observed in all other
groups (P > 0.05).

Anxiety commonly accompanies memory loss
in AD patients. To investigate whether D-Ribose
administration leads to anxiety-related behavior, the mice
were tested in the elevated plus-maze. D-Ribose (0.375 g/
kg·d and 3.75 g/kg·d)-treated mice showed lower numbers
of entries into the open arms (n = 12, P = 0.0299, P =
0.0293). The D-Glucose (0.45 g/kg·d)-treated group also
showed a decreased number of entries (n = 12, P = 0.0145)

display an anxiety-related behavior, an open field arena
test was performed, in which the decrease in the time
spent in the central area of the arena is considered as an
index of anxiety. Mice with D-Ribose (0.375 g/kg·d)administration spent significantly less time in the central
zone, and travelled less distances within the center of the
arena (n = 12, P = 0.0022, P = 0.0039) (Supplementary
Figure 2a, b). However, mice treated with both low and
high dose D-Glucose did not show any alterations in this
test (n = 12, P > 0.05). To determine whether D-Ribose
affects the behavior in the open field test, we counted
the entries of the square centre. Both low and high doses

of D-Ribose significantly decreased the square centre
entries in mice (n = 12, P = 0.0001, P = 0.0004), but
the entries were not D-Ribose concentration dependent
(Supplementary Figure 2c).

and memory [33]. To clarify whether the learning and
memory results from depression or not, we performed

increased in the D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)-administrated
mice compared with controls suggesting that D-Ribose
might induce depression-like behavior (n = 12, P = 0.022)
(Supplementary Figure 3). To assess this further, we
carried out the tail suspension test, referring to the duration
of immobility as ‘despair’. The analysis showed that
D-Ribose treatment did not cause a marked increase in the
immobility time compared to D-Glucose-treated groups

of Ser214 (pS214) that is unique to AD and not found
in normal Tau [37]. Levels of pS214 were significantly
increased in the hippocampi (3.75 g/kg·d) and cortex of
D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d and 0.375 g/kg·d)-treated mice
(n = 6, P = 0.024, P = 0.0042, P = 0.00143) (Figure 3a,
b). We also employed immunohistochemistry and found
that, except for the intracellular accumulation of pS214 in
hippocampi of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d and 0.375 g/kg·d)treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7a, 7a’, 7b, 7b’),
where there were no overt changes observed in the other
experimental groups compared to controls (Supplementary
Figure 7c, 7c’-7e, 7e’; 7f, 7f’-7j, 7j’).
Finally, we determined levels of phospho-Thr181
(pT181), which is believed to be a reliable marker in
predicting the conversion from mild cognitive dysfunction
to AD [38]. Levels of pT181 were significantly increased
in the hippocampi of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)-treated mice
(n = 6, P = 0.0283) (Figure 3a). The immunohistochemical
analyses revealed an increase of immunoreactivity
for pT181 in hippocampi of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg)treated mice (Supplementary Figure 8a, 8a’). However,
the hippocampal (Supplementary Figure 8b, b’-d, d’)
and cortical (Supplementary Figure 8f, 8f’-8i, 8i’)
sections of the other experimental groups did not show
increased immunoreactivity compared to the controls
(Supplementary Figure 8e, 8e’; 8j, 8j’).
The data collectively show that oral administration
of high dose D-Ribose triggers the hyperphosphorylation
of Tau in mice. Under the tested conditions, the oral
administration of D-Ribose to mice is much more effective
in triggering Tau hyperphosphorylation than D-Glucose,
especially in the hippocampus.

closely related to cognitive impairments. We therefore
determined Tau phosphorylation in brain by Western
blotting analyses.
First, using the monoclonal antibody Tau-5, we
found no significant difference in total Tau levels between
the experimental and control groups (P > 0.05) (Figure
3a, 3b). Full-length blots were presented in Supplementary
Figure 14 and 15. Next, we used the monoclonal antibody
Tau-1 (recognizing amino acid residues 189-207) that
detects dephosphorylated forms of Tau. The signals of
Tau-1 were decreased in the cortex of both the D-Ribose
(3.75 g/kg·d)- and D-Glucose-treated groups (n = 6, P =
0.0231, P = 0.0154, P = 0.0281) (Figure 3b), and slightly
decreased in the hippocampus of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)treated mice (n = 6, P > 0.08) (Figure 3a). This indicates
that cellular Tau protein should be more phosphorylated
in these groups.
Therefore, in order to investigate whether Tau was
hyperphosphorylated, we used antibody AT8 to detect
Tau phosphorylated at epitopes Ser199 and Ser202, the
sites that represent one of the earliest neuropathological
changes, with a pivotal role in the initial pathogenesis of
AD [35]. AT8 levels were significantly increased in the
hippocampus and cortex of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)-treated
mice (n = 6, P = 0.0238, P = 0.0222) (Figure 3). AT8 levels
were also increased in the cortex of the two D-Glucose
(0.45 g/kg·d and 4.5 g/kg·d)-treated groups, but not in
their hippocampi (Figure 3). To further analyze the role
D-Ribose has in AT8 phosphorylation, we performed the
immunohistochemical staining of brain sections. AT8
immunoreactivity (in red) was evident in hippocampal
and cortical neurons after the mice had been treated with
D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d) for 6 months (Figure 4a, 4a’, 4f,
4f’). A slight increase in AT8 reactivity was also observed
in the hippocampi and cortices of mice treated with the
lower dose of D-Ribose (0.375 g/kg·d) (Figure 4b, 4b’,
4g, 4g’). However, AT8-immunoreactivity was not strong
in the cortex and hippocampus of D-Glucose-treated mice
(Figure 4c, 4c’, 4h, 4h’, 4d, 4d’, 4i, 4i’), and it was almost
absent in controls (Figure 4e, 4e’, 4j, 4j’).
We also explored the phosphorylation of Ser396
(pS396), an epitope with a key role in the formation of
paired helical filaments in AD [36]. Levels of pS396 were
significantly (n = 6, P = 0.031, P = 0.0269) increased
in the hippocampi of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)- and
D-Glucose (0.45 g/kg·d)-treated mice (Figure 3a), but
no increase was found in the cortex (n = 6, P > 0.05).
By immunohistochemistry, with β-actin staining as
negative control (Supplementary Figure 5), except for the
intracellular accumulation of pS396 in hippocampi (and to
some degree in cortex) of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)- treated
mice (Supplementary Figure 6a, 6a’, 6f, 6f’), there was no
increased phosphorylation in the other experimental mice
compared to controls (Supplementary Figure 6b, 6b’-6e,
6e’; 6g, 6g’-6j, 6j’).

in

Amyloid-β is one of the major factors in the
progression of AD pathology. To clarify whether
D-Ribose induces the accumulation of Aβ besides Tau
hyperphosphorylation, we measured the Aβ content in
the mouse brain with the antibody against Aβ1-42 after
administration of sugar. Aβ levels were significantly
elevated in the hippocampus of D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)treated mice compared with controls (n = 6, P = 0.0317)
(Figure 5a, Supplementary Figure 9). However, APP
levels were not markedly increased (n = 6, P = 0.906). In
the cortex, neither Aβ nor APP levels were significantly
increased in both D-Ribose- and D-Glucose-gavaged
mice (Figure 5b). Full-length blots were presented in
Supplementary Figure 16. To further demonstrate the
elevated Aβ-like product levels in the D-Ribose-gavaged
mice, the ELISA was used. Aβ-like product levels
were also significantly elevated in the hippocampus of
D-Ribose (both 0.375g/kg·d and 3.75 g/kg·d)-treated mice
compared with controls (n = 4, P = 0.0491, P = 0.0095)

No significant differences in blood D-Glucose
and serum AGEs levels between D-Ribose- and

(Figure 5c). In cortex, Aβ-like product levels were not
markedly increased (Figure 5d). The selective elevation of
Aβ-like product in the hippocampus may contribute to the
D-Ribose-mediated impairment in learning and memory.
In the hippocampus, we observed immunoreactivity for
Aβ-like product in the D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)-treated
group, different from all other treatment groups (Figure
6). This demonstrates that administration of D-Ribose can
promote Aβ-like deposition in the hippocampus but not
the cortex.

We measured and recorded concentrations of blood
D-Glucose in mice (normal fasting blood sugar levels
of 5~10 mmol/L) during the 6-month administration
(Supplementary Table 2). No significant difference in
the concentration of blood sugar was observed between

by Western blotting using anti-Aβ1-42 polyclonal antibody and anti-APP polyclonal antibody. β-Actin was used as a loading control.

compared with controls that were however not significant.
No significant difference in fasting blood sugar levels was
found between D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)- and D-Glucose
(4.5 g/kg.d)-gavaged mice, suggesting that the slight
increase in insulin levels did not markedly affect levels
of blood sugar.
To further investigate whether oral administration
of D-Ribose enhances the glycation of serum proteins,
we measured levels of AGEs in different mouse tissues.
Levels of AGEs in the serum did not differ between the
groups. Marked changes in AGEs were not found in

the D-Ribose- and D-Glucose-gavaged groups (n = 12,
P > 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 10a, b). The changes
in fasting blood sugar were in the normal range (5~10
mmol/L) even though significant decreases were observed
in all sugar treatment groups from the second month
compared with control. This indicates that administration
of either D-Ribose or D-Glucose did not induce hyperor hypo-glycemia under our experimental conditions.
We also measured the concentration of serum insulin
(Supplementary Figure 11). Only D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d)treated mice showed a slight increase in serum insulin

cortex, hippocampus and kidney either, except for liver
where AGEs increased in the 4.5 g/kg·d D-Glucose group
(Supplementary Figure 12). These results indicate that oral
administration of D-Ribose does not induce overweight,
hyper- or hypo-glycemia and AGE accumulation,
compared to D-Glucose and the control under our
experimental conditions. AGEs might not be involved in
memory impairment and anxiety-like behavior of mice
that have been administered D-Ribose orally.

To compare the effects between D-Ribose and
D-Glucose, oral administration of D-Glucose did not
affect cognition. Even though D-Glucose showed elevated
pS396 levels in the hippocampus and AT8 reactivity
in the cortex, the elevations were not clearly seen by
immunohistochemical staining of sections using antibodies
AT8, pS396, p214 and T181 (Figure 4, Supplementary
Figure 6-8). D-Glucose was found to reduce the percentage
of open arm entries of mice in the elevated plus-maze
test (Figure 2). However, the D-Glucose-gavaged mice
did not show an abnormal behavior in the open field test
(Supplementary Figure 2), indicating that D-Glucosegavaged mice may not be anxious. Oral administration of
D-Glucose did not cause high levels of Aβ-like deposits.
In contrast, gavage of D-Ribose resulted not only in high
levels of Aβ-like deposition and Tau phosphorylation in
the hippocampus, but also in memory loss and anxietylike behavior.
The long-term administration of D-Ribose did
not cause any significant changes in the body weight
compared to mice treated with D-Glucose. Fasting blood
sugar levels and AGE levels did not differ between
the groups. Except for memory loss and anxiety, both
D-Ribose- and D-Glucose-gavaged mice did not show
additional abnormal behavior such as motor dysfunction,
reduced muscle strength and impaired co-ordination. Even
though D-Glucose-gavaged mice showed a decrease in the
open arm entries (Figure 2b), they behaved normally in the
open field test. Thus, D-Glucose-induced depression-like
behavior is not supported by our study.
As shown in Supplementary Figure 11, the blood
insulin level was slightly increased in D-Ribose-treated
mice (3.75 g/kg·d). As described by Segal and colleagues
[44], D-Ribose can cause insulin release and decrease
blood D-Glucose. Our results are similar to their findings
(Supplementary Table 2). Since mice were gavaged with
the sugar, it needs more insulin to regulate it. The secreted
insulin induced lower level of blood sugar [44, 45].
In AD, memory disorder is known as the most
important symptom. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms
like anxiety and depression may also follow the memory
loss. In this study, D-Ribose-treated mice exhibit an
anxious symptom in open field test and elevated plus
maze. Open field test on D-Ribose-treated mice was
equivocal though counts of center square entries gave
some positive results. Elevated plus maze shows the
data in a D-Ribose concentration dependent manner.
However, the data obtained with these tests were often
contradictory as described by Carola and colleagues [46].
For our data, it is possible that the elevated plus-maze test
was more suitable to exhibit the anxiety-like behaviors
for D-Ribose-gavaged mice. Of course, the anxiety-like
effect of D-Ribose on mice should be further investigated.
Forced swim test showed that the mice under D-Ribose
treatment behave more immobile, which indicates the
depression state. While tail suspension test did not show

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we showed that feeding
D-Ribose daily through gavage to mice for 6 months is
correlated with cognitive impairment. Mice treated with
D-Ribose (3.75 g/kg·d) exhibited learning and memory
decline and anxiety-like behavior, accompanied by Aβ-like
deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation in their brain,
especially the hippocampus. These features are AD-like,
both with regards to pathology (abnormal modifications
and aggregations of Tau protein and Aβ peptide) and
pathophysiology (memory loss accompanied by anxietylike behavior). This suggests that D-Ribose-gavaged
mouse model may be useful to study age-related cognitive
impairment [39] and diabetic encephalopathy, conditions
in which Aβ deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation are
found [40, 41].
The D-Ribose-induced high level of Aβ-like
deposition in the hippocampus demonstrates that mice
can develop Aβ-like deposits even though the APP gene
sequence of mice differs from that of humans [16, 42].
Previously, we employed mice in a methanol-gavage
experiment and found that methanol can distinctly promote
hyperphosphorylation of Tau, but not Aβ deposition
[43]. However, by oral administration of D-Ribose, Aβlike deposition can be induced under the experimental
conditions. Amyloid β deposit is clear and robust (Figure
6). The anti-Aβ antibody employed may recognize Aβ
monomer and the polymers in immunohistochemical
sections, since there are much higher molecular
masses of polymers besides a slight band of 4kDa Aβ
(Supplementary Figure 16).
D-Ribose is significantly increased in the brain
of D-Ribose-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 13).
However, it did not markedly increase AGE levels in the
brain, serum, liver and kidney under the experimental
conditions. However, intraperitoneal injection of similar
concentrations of D-Ribose for 30 days, as described
[22], resulted in AGE accumulation in the mouse blood
and brain. Whether D-Ribose elevates levels of AGEs in
mice or not depends on the mode of administration. Thus,
impairment of cognitive ability by oral administration
of D-Ribose is probably not related to brain AGE
accumulation, but rather the abnormally high levels of Aβlike deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation in mouse
brain (Supplementary Paragraph 1).

any difference in the immobility time. Administration of
D-Glucose as a control did not show anxiety-like behavior
and significant depression state. Take all those results,
oral administration of D-Ribose induces not only memory
impairment but also anxious behavior in mice.
Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which
there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.
Diabetic encephalopathy is one of the serious diabetic
complications leading to memory loss [32] and anxiety
[47]. Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ deposition in the
diabetic brain have been reported [40, 41, 48]. Recently,
we found that type 2 diabetic patients have abnormally
high levels of uric Ribose [49] which is positively
correlated with the severity of diabetes [24]. Oral
administration of D-Ribose to mice also causes impaired
memory functions, Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβlike deposition. These data suggest that an imbalance
of D-Ribose metabolism may play a role in diabetic
encephalopathy.
In summary, oral administration of D-Ribose leads
to the impairment of cognitive ability and anxious behavior
in mice. Meanwhile, D-Ribose-gavaged mice suffer from
both Aβ-like deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation in
their brain, especially in the hippocampus. These abnormal
modifications and the pathological aggregation of these
proteins are probably correlated with the memory loss
and anxiety-like behavior after D-Ribose treatment. Oral
administration of D-Ribose to mice or rats is conveniently
performed with a highly reproducible phenotype which
can be used as an animal model for cognitive impairment
and diabetic encephalopathy (Supplementary Paragraph
2).

control). All mice were maintained under pathogen-free
conditions. We have described this procedure in detail in
Supplementary Methods.

Measurement of body weight and blood sugar/
insulin concentrations
Body weight and blood sugar concentrations were
recorded once per month from 8 to 32 weeks of age
for mice. Fasting blood D-Glucose of mice were tested
using a Sannuo safe blood D-Glucose meter (Changsha
Sannuo Biological Sensing Technology Co., LTD, China),
and the blood insulin concentration was detected by
radioimmunoassay according to the instruction of Fred
Clinical Inspection Institution (Hebei, China).

Measuring grip strength
A tension meter (Bioseb, France) was used to test
the forelimb grip strength in mice as described by Tilson
and colleagues [50]. Mice were held at their tails and their
front paws grasped the grid. Five grip force measurements
were made and the LCD screen of the tension meter
automatically displayed the maximum tensile strength at
each time. The average of five measurements was taken to
represent the forelimb grip strength.

Rotarod test
As described by Guo and colleagues [34], mice
were trained for 2 days on the Rotarod (Panlab, Spain)
at a fixed speed of 10 r.p.m. for 5 min three times a day.
On the third day, the mice were tested on the Rrotarod at
a speed accelerating from 4 to 40 r.p.m. over the course
of 5 min. The latency for each mouse to fall from the rod
was recorded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
The handing of mice and experimental procedures
have been approved by the Animal Welfare and Research
Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Permit Number: SYXK2013-77),
and the methods were carried out in accordance with the
approved guidelines.

Y-maze
The Y-maze we used was composed of three
equally spaced arms (120o; 40 cm long × 5 cm wide ×
15 cm high). Activity in a Y-maze (Huaibeizhenghua
biological instrument equipment Co., LTD, China) was
used to measure spontaneous alternation performance
(spatial working memory) and locomotor activity. The
mice were placed in one of the arm compartments and
allowed to move freely for 6 min. The sequence of arm
entries was manually recorded. Alternation was defined
as an entry into all three arms in consecutive choices.
Spontaneous alternation percentage (SA%) was defined
as the ratio of the arm entry choices that differed from
the previous two choices to the total choices. The
number of maximum spontaneous alternation was then
calculated as the total number of arms entered minus 2

Animals and administration of D-Ribose and
D-Glucose
Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks) were obtained
from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co.
Ltd. (Beijing, China). The mice were randomly divided
into five groups, and spent four days to acclimatize to the
cages afterwards. Then, the mice received a daily gavage
administration for 6 months of D-Ribose (0.375 g/kg or
3.75 g/kg), D-Glucose (0.45 g/kg or 4.5 g/kg), or saline (as

maze (that is finding the submerged escape platform)
was calculated for each trial. On day 7, a probe test was
carried out by removing the platform and allowing each
mouse to swim freely for 60 sec. The time that mice spent
swimming in the target quadrant (where the platform had
been located during the hidden platform training) was
measured. All data were recorded with a computerized
video system.

and the percentage was calculated as: actual alternations/
maximum alternations×100 [51].

Open field test
Mice were subjected to an open field test in an
apparatus that consisted of a 50×50 cm open arena with
40 cm-high walls (Huaibeizhenghua biological instrument
equipment Co., LTD, China). The entire test arena was
adjusted to ensure even illumination. The mice were
placed in the center of the arena, and their activity was
recorded for 5 min. For video analysis, the open field arena
was divided into 16 equal squares, and the centre square
was defined as the central zone. Average velocity and total
distance traveled were used as measures of overall motor
activity. Activity in the central zone is usually regarded as
a measure of anxiety.

Tail suspension test
The tail suspension apparatus consisted of a box of
20×20×30 cm and the test was performed as described
[53]. The duration of immobility and the power of
movement were recorded for 6 min using the Bioseb
vision 3.0 system. Immobility was defined as the absence
of any limb or body movements, except those caused
by respiration. The power of movement was analysed
in terms of force, energy and power developed over
time, discriminating a behavior made up of weak and
long lasting movements, from one of brief and intense
movements.

Elevated plus maze
The elevated plus maze (EPM) is made of four
arms (30×6 cm, Huaibeizhenghua Biological Instrument
Equipment Co., LTD, China) that are arranged in the
configuration of a ‘+’ sign, comprising two open arms
across from each other and perpendicular to two closed
arms with a center platform (5×5 cm). The open arms had
neither side nor end walls, whereas the closed arms had
side and end walls (15 cm in height) but were open on
the top. The mice were placed in the central square facing
the corner between a closed and an open arm. Numbers
of entries, which were defined as all four paws being
positioned within one arm and the time spent on each arm,
were measured. The number of rearing in the closed arms
and of head-dipping was also measured at the same time
[34].

Forced swim test
The forced swim apparatus comprised of a clear
plexiglas cylinder (25 cm in height, 10 cm in diameter).
The mice were placed in this apparatus, which was filled
with 24°C water to a depth of 15 cm. Fresh water was used
for each mouse. In a 6-min test session, the first 2 min
were designated as a habituation period and the duration
of immobility during the final 4 min was recorded [34].

Sample collection from animals
After the behavioral testing, the mice were sacrificed
and their blood was collected as described previously [54]
and centrifuged (4,000 r.p.m, 15 min, 20°C). Serum was
aspirated and stored at -80°C until assayed. At the same
time, the hippocampus, cortex, liver and kidney were
quickly dissected either for subsequent Western blotting,
or they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent
immunohistochemistry.

Morris water maze
The Morris water maze test was performed as
described previously [52]. The apparatus consisted of
a circular water tank (100 cm in diameter and 35 cm in
height), containing water (23±1°C) to a depth of 15.5 cm,
which was rendered opaque by adding white food dye.
A platform (4.5 cm in diameter and 14.5 cm in height)
was submerged 1 cm below the water surface and placed
at the midpoint of one quadrant. Mice were exposed to
a visual platform before they were exposed to a hidden
platform. The visual platform was the same as in the
hidden platform but a ‘flag’ was mounted that extends
above the water surface by approximately 12 cm. Each
mouse had four trials per day in the visual platform test
for four consecutive days. In the hidden platform test, each
mouse received four periods of training per day for six
consecutive days. The latency to escape from the water

Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting
Levels of AGEs in hippocampus, cortex, liver,
kidney and serum were determined by Western blotting
using standard protocols. The same method was used to
analyze the expression of phosphorylated T181 (pT181),
S214 (pS214), S396 (pS396), and Ser199/202 (AT8), or
dephosphorylated Ser199/202 (Tau-1) (recognizing amino

Immunoblot detection of Aβ
Immunoblot detection of Aβ in brain tissues was as
described [55]. Hippocampus and cortex samples were
homogenized (150 mM NaCl with protease inhibitor
cocktail in 50 mM Tris, pH of 8.0) and centrifuged
(300,000g × 45 min), and the supernatant was removed.
The pellet was then resuspended by sonication and
incubated for 15 min in homogenization buffer containing
1% SDS. Following pelleting of insoluble material
(16,000g × 15 min), the SDS-extract was electrophoresed
on SDS-PAGE (4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel from
Invitrogen, USA), blotted to PVDF membrane and probed
with a 1:1000 dilution of 6E10 (Covance, USA).
