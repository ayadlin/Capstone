Abstract
Although significant progress has been made in understanding the importance of Wnt signaling in
the initiation of colorectal cancer, less is known about responses that accompany the reversal of
oncogenic Wnt signaling. The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo and in vitro responses to an
‘ideal’ Wnt pathway inhibitor as a model for the therapeutic targeting of the pathway.
A tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse model expressing truncated β-catenin (ΔN89β-catenin)
that exhibited a strong intestinal hyperplasia was analysed during the removal of oncogenic βcatenin expression both in 3D ‘crypt culture’ and in vivo. Oncogenic Wnt signaling was rapidly
and completely reversed. The strongest inhibition of Wnt target gene expression occurred within
24 hours of doxycycline removal at which time the target genes Ascl2, Axin2 and C-myc were
down-regulated to levels below that in the control intestine. In vitro, the small molecule Wnt
inhibitor CCT036477 induced a response within 4 hours of treatment. By 7 days following
doxycycline withdrawal, gene expression, cell proliferation and tissue morphology were
undistinguishable from control animals.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the reversal of Wnt signaling by inhibitors should
ideally be studied within hours of treatment. The reversible system described, involving medium
throughput in vitro approaches and rapid in vivo responses, should allow the rapid advance of
early stage compounds into efficacy models that are more usually considered later in the drug
discovery pipeline.

The importance of Wnt signaling for intestinal development has been demonstrated using
both mouse models and organoid culture models.4-7 Inducible deletion of ß-catenin led to a
rapid and complete destruction of the crypt compartment that correlated with a reduction in
cell proliferation and the terminal differentiation of stem cells.4 The loss of intestinal crypts
was similarly observed in transgenic mice lacking Tcf4 and in animals over-producing the
extracellular Wnt signaling inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1).5, 6 In vitro, the Wnt pathway
activator R-spondin1 was required for the survival and development of intestinal organoids
in culture.7
Mutations that constitutively activate canonical Wnt signaling constitute the most prevalent
genetic abnormality in human colon cancer where more than 90% of tumours contain
mutations that activate the pathway.8 Mutations to ß-catenin prevent the phosphorylation of
N-terminal serine and threonine residues (S33, S37, T41, S45) that are required for turnover
leading to ligand-independent expression of the Wnt target genes.9

Harada et al. showed that Cre-loxP deletion of exon 3 of ß-catenin (including S33, S37, T41,
S45 sequences) induced the formation of adenomatous intestinal polyps.10 Wong et al. failed
to identify tumour formation following expression of a ß-catenin transgene lacking the 89 Nterminal amino acids (ΔN89ß-catenin), but did observe increased crypt cell proliferation and
apoptosis accompanied by a slowing of the cell migration within the crypt/villus axis.11
Romagnolo et al. created a transgenic mouse model expressing a ΔN131 ß-catenin protein
and identified a similar increase in apoptosis along with multifocal dysplastic regions in the
small intestine.12 Taken together, these results confirm the importance of the Wnt pathway
and suggest that stabilization of ß-catenin can be an initial step leading to colorectal cancer.
While the initiation of colorectal cancer following ß-catenin mutation has been studied in
detail, the more clinically important process of blocking oncogenic signaling has not been
followed.
Here, we have characterised for the first time the regression of an intestinal hyperplasia
using a doxycycline-dependent mouse model expressing mutant ß-catenin. Timecourse
analyses showed a surprisingly rapid restoration of the normal intestinal phenotype. In crypt
organoids in vitro, mutant ß-catenin was required for Wnt gene expression and cell survival.
Transcriptional responses to the inhibition of Wnt signaling were extremely rapid. Loss of
mutant ß-catenin in vivo resulted in an active inhibition of target gene expression within 24
hours while a small molecule inhibitor of Wnt signaling blocked targets within 4 hours. The
combined in vitro/in vivo models we describe should allow the early assessment of
compound efficacy in drug discovery programmes and emphasizes the importance of
studying anti-Wnt signaling therapeutics at very early times after administration.

Results
Expression of the tetracycline-inducible ΔN89ß-catenin in vitro and in vivo
A doxycycline-responsive promoter regulating expression of ΔN89-βcatenin was targeted
downstream of the collagen 1a1 locus by FLP-FRT site directed recombination.13 The
targeted ES cells already contained the doxycycline-regulated transactivator M2-rtTA gene
under the control of the constitutively active ROSA26 promoter (Figure 1A).13 Three out of
three analyzed clones were found to have integrated the transgene correctly and expression

of the ΔN89ß-catenin protein was dependent on doxycycline addition (Supplementary figure
1A and B). Mice were generated by diploid blastocyst injection. Following 10 days
treatment with 2mg/ml doxycycline in the drinking water, the expression of ΔN89ß-catenin
protein was noted in different tissues in mice, including skin, liver, lung, stomach and
intestine (Supplementary figure 1C). The global tissue transgene expression didn’t affect the
animals over the time-scale of the assays since the mice were viable after 15 days of
treatment.
The intestinal expression of ΔN89ß-catenin mRNA in Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice was
strongly induced (11,000-fold) 10 days after doxycycline treatment (p=0.03, Mann Whitney,
n=4; Figure 1B). Mutant β-catenin mRNA was undetectable in the intestine samples from
untreated mice (Supplementary figure 2A). Western blot analysis of intestinal tissues using
the Myc epitope tag antibody showed the presence of ΔN89β-catenin protein in doxycycline
treated Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice, but not in control or untreated mice (Figure 1C).
Immunolocalisation showed cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, ΔN89β-catenin expression within
both the crypt and villus compartments of doxycycline-treated Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA
mice (Figure 1D and Supplementary figure 2B). Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was
noted in the crypts of doxycycline-treated Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice (Figure 3C) and
was similarly observed in Cre+APCfl/fl mice following β-napthoflavone intra-peritoneal
injections (Supplementary figure 2C).
Taken together, these observations show low background levels and a strong induction of
ΔN89β-catenin expression following doxycycline treatment.
Loss of ΔN89ß-catenin expression after doxycycline removal

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The timecourse of responses to the removal of ΔN89β-catenin was determined by removing
doxycycline from the water of Tet-OΔN89β-catenin mice that had been induced for 10 days.
mRNA and protein expressions were assessed after 1, 2, 7 or 14 days of doxycycline
removal. ΔN89ß-catenin mRNA reverted to control levels within 1 day of doxycycline
removal (p=0.11, Mann Whitney, n=4) (Figure 2A). The rapid loss of ΔN89β-catenin
mRNA expression was not unexpected since the half-life of doxycycline in mouse serum is
estimated to be 3 hours, suggesting that at least 99% of serum doxycycline would be
excreted after 1 day.14 Western blot analyses also showed a rapid loss of ΔN89β-catenin
protein since protein was not detectable 1, 2, 7 or 14 days following doxycycline withdrawal
(Figure 2B). The rapid loss of ΔN89β-catenin, despite it being a stabilized form of ßcatenin, was compatible with the previous work since the half-life of truncated ß-catenin in
melanoma cells has been estimated to be approximately 4.5 hours by comparison with 2
hours for the wild-type protein.15 The rapidity of the biological response is clear, but finer
details of the dyamics are dependent on a complex interplay between the ΔΝ89β-catenin
mRNA decay rate, intestinal doxycycline levels and the threshold for Tet-O-promoter
activity in each intestinal cell type.
Up-regulation of stabilized β-catenin strongly modifies the crypt compartment
Histological analysis of the intestine samples from 10 day-induced ΔN89β-catenin mice
revealed an enlarged crypt compartment (Figure 3Ai). The number of cells per half-crypt
was 29.0±4.0 in induced versus 15.4±0.4 in control animals (p=0.03, Mann Whitney, n=4)
(Figure 3Aii). The expansion of the crypt compartment was associated with increased cell
proliferation. Crypts from induced Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice showed raised levels of
the S-phase marker Ki-67 and higher number of mitotic figures (5.84±0.49% versus
2.83±0.2% in control half-crypts p=0.03, Mann Whitney, n=4; Figure 3B and supplementary
figure 3). Apoptotic cell death as followed by active caspase-3 staining trended higher in
doxycycline treated crypts, but this was not statistically significant (38.8±22.0 positive cells

per 50 half crypts for Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice and 5.6±1.8 for control mice; p=0.19,
Mann Whitney, n=5; Figure 5A and 5B). Active caspase-3 cells in mutant crypts were
localized all along the enlarged crypt axis, in contrast with restricted apoptosis in the bottom
of control crypts (Supplementary figure 4). Intestinal differentiation processes were partly
altered following doxycycline treatment in Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice. While the
percentage of goblet and paneth cells per crypt was not changed (Supplementary figure 5),
the cellular localization of paneth cells within the crypt compartment was strongly modified
and was now distributed throughout the crypt-like area rather than being confined to their
normal position at the crypt base (Supplementary figure 6).
After 10 days doxycycline treatment, the body weight of Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice
was reduced by 13.8% compared to control mice (26.1±0.6g for control, 22.5±0.8g for
mutant; p<0.01, Mann Whitney, n=22-25; Supplementary figure 7).
To confirm the involvement of the Wnt pathway in these profound changes, the
accumulation of ß-catenin in the nucleus of crypt cells was analysed by
immunohistochemistry using an antibody recognizing both endogenous and truncated βcatenin and the expression of known Wnt target genes was studied by qRT-PCR. As
expected, after 10 days doxycycline treatment, a high number of cells in hyperproliferative
crypts showed nuclear accumulation of ß-catenin in Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice
(Figure 3C). In addition, the majority of the Wnt target genes (Ascl2, Axin2, c-myc and
Ephb2 but not Lgr5 and Tiam1) were up-regulated (Figure 3D). The level of endogenous βcatenin mRNA was not altered following 10-days doxycycline treatment in Tet-OΔN89βcatenin-rtTA mice (data not shown).

In contrast to the phenotype seen in intestinal crypts, we did not observe any changes in the
villus compartment 10-days after doxycycline treatment of Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice
even although ΔN89β-catenin protein was expressed in the villus (Figure 1D). The number
of cells per half-villus was similar in control (86.7±4.3) and Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA
(98.7±4.8) mice (p=0.09, Mann Whitney, n=5) (data not shown) and the villus cell marker
alkaline phosphatase was expressed at similar levels in both groups of mice (data not
shown). Lastly, no Ki-67 stained proliferating cells were detected in ΔN89β-catenin
expressing or control villus tissues (Figure 3B).
Reversal of the Wnt pathway induces rapid regression of the crypt compartment
The effect of reversal of the Wnt pathway was rapid. After one day of doxycycline
withdrawal, the crypt compartment of Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice was reduced in size
and by day 7, crypts from mutant mice were histologically indistinguishable from control
crypts (Figure 4A). No statistically significant differences in cell numbers were noted
between control and mutant mice after 1, 2, 7 or 14 days of doxycycline removal (Figure
4B).
The rapid reduction in crypt cell number was associated with an equally rapid reduction in
crypt cell proliferation. After 1-day without doxycycline, the Ki67-positive compartment in
Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice was still enlarged by comparison with controls (Figure
4C), but no significant difference were noted between the number of Ki67-positive cells and
mitotic figures in crypts from control and Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice (Figure 4D and
supplementary figure 3). Two days after doxycycline removal, no significant difference
were observed between the number of Ki67-positive cells and mitotic figures in control and
Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice (Figure 4C, 4D and supplementary figure 3). After 7 and
14 days without doxycycline, the number of Ki67-positive and mitotic cells in the intestine
was similar between control and Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice (Figure 4C, 4D and
supplementary figure 3). The rapid decrease of cell number in the crypt compartment of TetOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 14.

OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice following doxycycline removal was associated with raised
levels of apoptosis (Figure 5A and 5B). The number of caspase-3 positive cells in 50 halfcrypts, including data from both 1-day and 2-day doxycycline removal, was 14.6±3.1 for
Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice and 6.0±1.1 for control mice (p=0.03, Mann Whitney,
n=10; Figure 5B). The localization of active caspase-3 cells in mutant crypts was mainly
observed at the bottom of the crypt following 1-day and 2-day doxycycline removal
(Supplementary figure 4). The localization of paneth cells in mutant mice reverted into a
normal position at the crypt base 7 days following doxycycline removal (Supplementary
figure 6).
The removal of doxycycline was associated with profound alterations of gene expression in
the intestine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that multiple Wnt target genes were
actively down-regulated 1 day after doxycycline removal in Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA by
comparison with controls (Figure 5C). After 2-days, Axin2, C-myc, Ephb2 and Lgr5 were
still significantly repressed while expression levels were similar between mutant and control
animals by 7 and 14 days following doxycycline withdrawal. The restoration of normal
intestinal morphology by 7 days after doxycycline removal correlated with a recovery in
body weight (Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA 26.4±0.4g versus control 27.0±0.5g, p=0.67, Mann
Whitney, n=8) (Supplementary figure 7).
Doxycycline-dependent activation of Wnt signaling in intestinal organoids
To develop a system that allowed a kinetic analysis of early changes during oncogenic
reversal, the tetracycline-inducible model was adapted for use with a recently described in
vitro crypt culture technique.7 The potential toxicity of doxycycline was first analysed using
Axin2-LacZ organoids in the presence of R-spondin. At 2μg/ml, doxycycline did not affect
normal organoid growth or expression of Axin2-LacZ in the crypt compartment
(Supplementary figure 8).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

As previously described, the growth of the crypt culture organoids was dependent on the
presence of the Wnt signaling regulator R-spondin (Figure 6A).7 Intestinal organoids
cultured in the absence of R-spondin failed to develop crypt domains and instead formed
spherical structures at 3 days that subsequently degenerated with high levels of cell death
from 4-5 days (Figure 6A). However, in the absence of R-spondin, treatment with
doxycycline (2μg/ml) rescued the organoids from cell death (Figure 6A). In this context,
doxycycline induced expression of high levels of ΔN89ß-catenin mRNA (29,000-fold;
p=0.003, t-test, n=3) and activated Wnt target gene expression (Figure 6B and 6C).
Interestingly, the doxycycline/ΔN89β-catenin-rescued organoids formed abnormal crypts
that lacked the characteristic tear-shaped structures observed in normal tissues and control
organoids. These doxycycline-rescued structures contained goblet cells, in contrast with
Cre+APCfl/fl organoids (Supplementary figure 9). In addition, the doxycycline-stimulated
structures showed low but uniform levels of Axin-2-lacZ expression as compared to the
localized expression of Axin2-lacZ in the lower crypt region of uninduced structures treated
with R-spondin (Figure 6A).
To recapitulate the in vivo effect of doxycycline removal, doxycycline-containing culture
medium was removed from the matrigel-embedded structures for 24 hours after an initial 48
hours of doxycycline treatment. Under these conditions ΔN89ß-catenin mRNA levels were
significantly reduced (p=0.02, t-test, n=3) leading to a strong reduction in Wnt target gene
expression (Figure 6B and 6C).

Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA organoids, a useful in vitro system to screen for Wnt inhibitors

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

CCT036477 is a recently identified small-molecule inhibitor of Wnt-signaling that induced
head and tail patterning defects in zebrafish embryos and inhibited the growth of colon
cancer cell lines.16 Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA organoids were treated with 2μg/ml
doxycycline for 72 hours, in the presence of 20uM CCT036477 for 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours.
No effect of CCT036477 was noted on the levels of 3 control RNAs (Supplementary figure
10). The strongest inhibitory response was observed after 4 hours of CCT036477 exposure.
The majority of the Wnt target genes (Ascl2, Ephb2, Lgr5 and Tiam1) were down-regulated
by 60-90% (Figure 7). Ascl2, Ephb2 and Lgr5 levels after 4 hours of compound treatment
were similar to that following 24 hours of doxycycline removal suggesting that CCT036477
treatment was as effective as lowering β-catenin levels by 75% (Figure 7). However,
CCT036477 didn’t strongly affect Axin2 or C-myc expression. The reason that all Wnt
targets were not similarly affected is unclear but may be related to the presence of multiple
cell types that have different thresholds for Wnt responsiveness. After 8 and 12 hours of
CCT036477 exposure, inhibitory effects decreased and were weak by 24 hours of exposure
(Figure 7). The reason for this loss of response is unclear but may be related to the stability
of the compound in culture or to a time-dependent oscillation of transcript levels since a
similar time-dependence was observed in vivo following doxycycline-removal (Figure 5C).
A similar type of response was observed in culture with another molecule that has more
stable properties. Interestingly, this small-molecule Wnt inhibitor recapitulated the in vitro
responses in the in vivo system (unpublished data).

Discussion

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The majority of human colorectal cancers are initiated by inappropriate activation of the
Wnt pathway.8 Mechanisms that alter Wnt signaling involve the inactivation of the APC
tumour suppressor or the stabilization of ß-catenin by mutation of residues within its Nterminus.17, 18 Several genetically encoded mouse models of Wnt pathway deregulation in
the intestine have been established.11, 19, 20 Both forced expression of ΔN89β-catenin or
conditional Apc deletion result in enlarged crypt compartments and increased levels of cell
proliferation and apoptosis.11, 19, 20 In the present study, doxycycline-dependent expression
of ΔN89β-catenin was associated with comparable alterations suggesting that the
doxycycline-inducible model system recapitulated early abnormalities that lead to
colorectal-cancer. The expression of ΔN89β-catenin did not change villus morphology or
proliferation, suggesting that differentiated villus cells are unable to re-enter the cell cycle or
to de-differentiate. Similar observations were made following ΔN89β-catenin expression in
villus cells directed by the Fabp1 promoter.11
The aim of the in vivo study was to analyse the consequences of Wnt pathway inhibition in
the mouse intestine since the removal of doxycycline should behave as an ‘ideal’ therapeutic
modulator and should reverse oncogenic signaling, but not interfere with the restoration of
normal crypt function. A combination of histological and molecular markers showed that
ongoing ΔN89β-catenin expression in mice was necessary for the maintenance of the
hyperplastic crypt phenotype and that loss of expression initiated a rapid cascade of
responses that restored normal crypt morphology within 7 days (Figure 4). Of particular
note, Wnt target gene expression rapidly dropped to a level 3 to 8 times lower than the
control epithelium within 24 hours. A feature of Wnt signaling is the role of multiple Wnt
transcriptional targets (Eg. Dkk1, Axin2, ß-TrCP, Nkd, TCF-1) in negative feedback
inhibition of signaling through mechanisms including the blocking of Wnt receptor function
and the stabilisation of the destruction complex.21, 22 Here, we speculate that feedback Wnt
inhibitor proteins accumulate following ΔN89β-catenin expression and act to repress basal
levels of Wnt signaling below levels in normal tissues after doxycycline removal.

Interestingly, the pattern of Wnt target gene expression observed in Fig.5B shows
characteristics of a time-dependent dampened wave that might result a feedback inhibition
mechanism that showed a degree of overcompensation.

An important question concerns the mechanism(s) involved in the rapid loss of crypt cells
after Wnt pathway inhibition. In our study, about 70% of excess crypt cells were lost within
24 hours of doxycycline withdrawal, suggesting that even earlier experimental time points
might be useful to understand the earliest processes. We noted raised levels of apoptosis in
the intestine 1 and 2 days after doxycycline removal. Raised levels of apoptosis were
recently observed following treatment of acute myeloid leukemia cells with small molecule
inhibitors of Wnt signaling and were associated with decreased expression of Wnt target
proteins, such as C-myc.23 Similarly, treatment of numerous cancer cell lines, including
breast, lung, mesothelioma and sarcoma, with a monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody induced
apoptosis and down-regulation of Wnt pathway targets.24 These results suggest that the
down-regulation of Wnt signaling enhances intestinal apoptosis during the reversal of the
hyperplastic intestinal phenotype. However, it is important to note that the relationship
between Wnt pathway activity and apoptosis is not always clear since Kuhnert et al.
observed that Dkk-1 adenoviral expression in mice repressed intestinal epithelial
proliferation and Wnt target gene expression, but did not modify apoptotic levels.6

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cell proliferation in the intestine was rapidly suppressed following doxycycline withdrawal
in Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice. However, although the hyperplastic phenotype was
rapidly reversible, it is unknown whether polyp development or colorectal cancers generated
by multiple cooperating mutations would be similarly dependent on continued Wnt
signaling. Recently, using colorectal cancer cells containing a doxycycline-inducible ßcatenin shRNAs system, Scholer-Dahirel et al. demonstrated that sustained Wnt pathway
activation was required for the maintenance of APC-mutated colorectal tumors in immunocompromised mice.25 Similarly, Gunther et al. used a doxycycline-inducible approach to
conditionally express the Wnt1 oncogene in the mammary gland.26 They noted that Wnt1initiated mammary tumors completely regressed following doxycycline withdrawal. Coste et
al. demonstrated that an oncogenic β-catenin allele that was expressed sporadically in vivo
did not result in intestinal tumourigenesis and speculated that β-catenin’s oncogenic effect
may require the presence of a field of mutant cells termed βfield cancerizationβ.27 Studies
of mutant ß-catenin in melanoma by contrast suggest that a ‘just right’ level of ß-catenin
expression (neither too high or low) may be necessary for tumourigenesis.28 Future studies
will be needed to determine whether intestinal tumors derived in the Tet-OΔN89β-cateninrtTA background will be similarly dependent on the maintenance of mutant ß-catenin
expression.
The aim of the in vitro study was to develop a crypt culture system that allowed a kinetic
analysis of early changes during oncogenic reversal. Tetracycline-driven ΔN89β-catenin
expression replaced the requirement for the Wnt pathway activator R-spondin in the growth
of intestinal organoids, presumably by inducing expression of Wnt target genes required for
cell survival. However, ΔN89β-catenin over-expression did not fully recapitulate the normal
crypt morphology induced by R-spondin. Several explanations may account for the different
phenotypes. Firstly, doxycycline-induced ΔN89β-catenin expression was probably
expressed throughout the cultured crypts while R-spondin has been shown to enhance
endogenous Wnt signals that may be localised to paneth cells at the base of the crypt.29, 30
This contention is supported by the observation that Axin-2-lacZ was localized in R-spondin
treated structures but was broadly expressed when replaced by doxycycline-induced ßcatenin expression. Secondly, ΔN89β-catenin over-expression may insufficient to a high
enough level of Wnt target gene expression to drive a normal development program. The
developmental and oncogenic outcomes of deregulated Wnt signaling vary from tissue to

tissue and can be highly dependent on the absolute level of TCF-dependent transcriptional
activity.31 Lastly, expression of ΔN89β-catenin may be unable to rescue branches of noncanonical Wnt signaling that are responsible for morphological aspects of crypt
development.32, 33

Using the in vitro system a small molecule Wnt pathway inhibitor was shown to downregulate ΔN89β-catenin-driven Wnt target gene expression. The early time-point of
maximal Wnt-target transcriptional response (4 hours) emphasises the importance of early
analysis of drug action since the later responses may be masked by compound clearance/
degradation. The early timescale of responses in vitro corresponded well with the rapid
responses observed in vivo where maximal responses were observed within 24 hours of
doxycycline removal. Importantly, at later times in vivo, responses to compound may be
obscured by a rebound in target transcripts levels that accompanies the restoration of normal
levels of signaling. In conclusion, we have shown that Wnt pathway up-regulation induced a
proliferative response in the intestine, and that the reversal of Wnt signaling rapidly restored
the initial structure of the intestine. These observations provide evidence that downregulation of the Wnt pathway has potent anti-hyperplastic activities in vivo. Targeting
oncogenic mutations involving the Wnt pathway, using a specific therapy, may therefore
reverse an abnormal phenotype in vivo. As observed in this Tet-O mouse model, the effect
of a βgold standardβ treatment targeting the Wnt pathway should induce an almost
immediate response, with the first effects on target gene expression being observed within
24 hours. Similarly, the in vitro system demonstrates that transcriptional response associated
with the inhibition of Wnt signaling should be studied at early timepoints. These
combinations of the in vitro and in vivo models provide a complementary pair of approaches
for the discovery of inhibitors of Wnt signaling and intestinal tumourigenesis. For the first
time these constitute a reversible system that can be used to characterize the early-stage
compound efficacy before time-consuming medicinal chemistry is deployed to optimize hit
compound pharmacodynamics.

Generation of tet-O-ß-catenin mutant mice
The pBS31 flp-in vector was engineered to contain the following four cassettes. The pgk
promoter followed by an ATG and an FRT site. A splice acceptor double polyA cassette
derived from the ROSA26 target vector. The CMV minimal promoter containing
tetracycline response operator sequences from pTETOP and an SV40 polyA signal.13, 34, 35
This aid rapid cloning of longer cDNAs, pBS31pgkATGFRTTet-O was converted into a

introduced into KH2 embryonic stem (ES) cells containing M2-rtTA under control of the
endogenous ROSA26 promoter as described previously.13 Mice were generated by diploid
blastocyst injection into 3.5dpc blastocysts from C57/Bl6-J females. Approximately 30
injected blastocysts were transferred into pseudopregnant CD1 recipient females

Doxycycline induction and small molecule inhibitor treatment

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Induction of ΔN89β-catenin expression in ES cells was achieved by culturing cells with
2μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for 2 days. For in vivo induction, eight-week-old mice were
fed 2mg/ml doxycycline and 10mg/ml sucrose in their drinking water for 10 days.
Doxycycline was then withdrawn for periods up to 14 days (n=4-6 for each group). Mice
negative for Tet-OΔN89 β-catenin and/or rtTA were used as controls. For in vitro
experiments, organoids were seeded in 24-well plates and 500μl of R-spondin 1-free crypt
culture medium containing 2μg/ml doxycycline was added. After 2 days, culture medium
was replaced by fresh medium containing 2μg/ml doxycycline (for 24 hours), both 2μg/ml
doxycycline (for 24 hours) and 20μM CCT036477 (for 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours) or no
doxycycline (for 24 hours) (n=3).
β-Galactosidase staining
Tet-OΔN89β-catenin-rtTA mice were crossed with Axin2-LacZ mice, a direct reporter of
canonical Wnt pathway activity.37 β-Galactosidase staining was conducted as previously
described.20
Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were extracted by scraping lysed ES cells from a confluent 10cm2 plate or by
crushing liquid nitrogen-frozen intestinal tissues using a mortar and pestle. Equal amounts of
cellular protein (80μg) were separated on a 4-12% Bis Tris Gel (Invitrogen) and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting utilised antibodies against the myc epitope
tag (1:1000, Sigma) and GAPDH as a protein loading control (1:5000, Chemicon).
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded and cut into 5μm sections for
immunostaining. Briefly, slides were boiled for 20 min in antigen retrieval solution (Dako)
followed by blocking in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min, avidin/biotin solutions for 30
min (Vector) and goat serum for 45 min (Vector). Slides where then incubated overnight
with rabbit primary antibodies directed against Ki67 (1/500, Millipore), lysozyme (1/400,
Dako), mucin2 (1/500, Santa Cruz), myc epitope tag (1/1500, Sigma), ß-catenin (1/100, Cell
Signaling) or active caspase 3 (1/750, R&D Systems). After 1-hour incubation with rabbit
biotinylated secondary antibody, detection was carried out using a Vectastain ABC kit
(Vector) for 30 min and visualized with DAB substrate chromogen for 10 min (Sigma).
For immunofluorescence, slides were treated as described above and were incubated
overnight with anti-ß-catenin antibody (1/1000, BD Transduction Laboratories). Slides were
then exposed to Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1/1000, Invitrogen) for 20 min and
DAPI stained (1/5000). Fluorescent images were taken on an IX-71 inverted microscope
(Olympus) via an ORCA-ER camera utilising SimplePCI software (Hamamatsu
Corporation). Illumination intensity, exposure, offset and gain settings were maintained
between samples.
Scoring apoptosis and mitosis
Mitotic cells on H&E-stained sections were scored as previously described.38 Fifty halfcrypts were counted for each mouse (n=4-5 per group). In addition, the number of cells per
villus was counted (50 half-villus, n=4-5 per group). Alkaline phosphatase staining was
performed as described by the manufacturer (Fast Red Substrate System, Dako).

qRT-PCR

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Three to five mice of each genotype were harvested after 10-day doxycycline exposure and
at 1, 2, 7, and 14 days following doxycycline removal. RNA was extracted from a 1cm
portion of small intestine taken approximately 7 cm from the stomach and frozen in liquid
N2. It is worth noting that intestinal RNA contains both crypt, villus and stromal/muscle
tissues that dilute stem cell markers such as Lgr-5. The tissue was homogenized and RNA
extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNA contamination was removed using the
TurboDnase kit (Ambion). For in vitro experiments, matrigel was mechanically dissociated
and organoids were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min. RNA was extracted
using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen).
For both in vivo and in vitro experiments, 1μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using
random hexamers (Promega) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (RT; Invitrogen). The
qRT-PCR was performed using FastSybr Green Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems).
Duplicate samples were analysed on a StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems) qRT-PCR
machine using the fast protocol. ß-Actin, ß-2 microglobulin and keratin 20 primers were
used to equalize the data. Threshold cycle (CT) values and the 2-ΔΔCT method were used
to calculate expression changes. The supplementary table 1 contains the list of primers used
in this study.
