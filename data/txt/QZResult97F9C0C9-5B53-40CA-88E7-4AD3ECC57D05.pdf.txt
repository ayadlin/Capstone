ABSTRACT
Here, we identified two new molecular targets, which are functionally sufficient
to metabolically confer the tamoxifen-resistance phenotype in human breast cancer
cells. Briefly, ~20 proteins were first selected as potential candidates, based on
unbiased proteomics analysis, using tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. Then, the cDNAs
of the most promising candidates were systematically transduced into MCF-7 cells.
Remarkably, NQO1 and GCLC were both functionally sufficient to autonomously
confer a tamoxifen-resistant metabolic phenotype, characterized by i) increased
mitochondrial biogenesis, ii) increased ATP production and iii) reduced glutathione
levels. Thus, we speculate that pharmacological inhibition of NQO1 and GCLC may
be new therapeutic strategies for overcoming tamoxifen-resistance in breast cancer
patients. In direct support of this notion, we demonstrate that treatment with a
known NQO1 inhibitor (dicoumarol) is indeed sufficient to revert the tamoxifenresistance phenotype. As such, these findings could have important translational
significance for the prevention of tumor recurrence in ER(+) breast cancers, which
is due to an endocrine resistance phenotype. Importantly, we also show here that
NQO1 has significant prognostic value as a biomarker for the prediction of tumor
recurrence. More specifically, higher levels of NQO1 mRNA strongly predict patient
relapse in high-risk ER(+) breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy (mostly
tamoxifen; H.R. > 2.15; p = 0.007).

INTRODUCTION

basis of tamoxifen-resistance at the molecular level [6,
7]. Importantly, once these key drivers of the tamoxifenresistance phenotype are identified they may also serve as
therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers to identify
high-risk patients, before they become tamoxifen-resistant
[8, 9].
Here, using a combination of proteomics analysis
and metabolic phenotyping, we identified enhanced
mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, as key
drivers of tamoxifen-resistance [10, 11]. In this context,
we showed that NQO1 and GCLC, were sufficient to
genetically confer tamoxifen-resistance in otherwise
tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cells, by enhancing their
mitochondrial function [12, 13]. Thus, NQO1 and GCLC

Drug-resistance, and the resulting treatment failure,
are still significant clinical barriers, preventing more
effective cancer therapy and better clinical outcomes [1].
For example, in ER(+) breast cancer, nearly 30% to 50%
of these patients develop resistance to endocrine-based
therapies, such as tamoxifen [2-4]. Tamoxifen-resistance
reveals itself clinically as tumor recurrence or systemic
metastasis, leading to advanced disease states and premature patient deaths [5]. Thus, endocrine-therapy
resistance is a major determinant that significantly reduces
the effectiveness of breast cancer therapy. As such, more
mechanistic studies are needed to understand the molecular

phenotyping in order to establish their behavior. For this
purpose, we employed the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer to
measure metabolic flux [17, 18]. Interestingly, Figure 2
illustrates that TAMR cells show an enhanced metabolic
phenotype, with significant increases in oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production, as well
as increased basal and maximal respiratory capacity.
However, no significant increases in glycolytic rates
were observed (Figure 3). This observed increase in
ATP production was independently validated using a
second independent biochemical assay (Figure 4A).
Consistent with the idea that increased mitochondrial
metabolism should lead to oxidative stress, we also found
that the steady-state levels of reduced glutathione were
significantly depleted (Figure 4B). Importantly, enhanced
oxidative mitochondrial metabolism was also observed in
a second independently-derived tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cell line, known as TAMR2 (Supplementary Figure 1).
We hypothesized that the observed increase in
oxygen consumption and ATP production might occur
via an increased capacity for mitochondrial biogenesis.
In direct support of our hypothesis, TAMR cells showed
a significant increase in both mitochondrial mass and
mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 5), as observed

RESULTS
Characterization of the metabolic phenotype of
tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell lines
In order to dissect the molecular basis of tamoxifenresistance that occurs during endocrine-based breast
cancer therapy, we used tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7
cell lines, such TAMR. The TAMR cell line is serially
passaged in the presence of tamoxifen to maintain its
resistance phenotype.
First, we validated the tamoxifen-resistance
phenotype of TAMR cells. Importantly, TAMR cells
behaved in a tamoxifen-resistant manner and continued to
grow, despite the presence of increasing concentrations of
tamoxifen [16] (Figure 1)
Then, TAMR cells were subjected to metabolic

would allow us to identify potential therapeutic targets
that might confer tamoxifen-resistance. These results are
summarized in Table 1. We focused on the top 20 proteins
that were over-expressed in TAMR cells, relative to
matched parental MCF-7 cells.
Note that several of the up-regulated proteins are

noticed that the BCAS1 protein was upregulated by > 50fold. Importantly, BCAS1 has been previously implicated

as a positive control in some of our experiments.
To begin to test our hypothesis that these genes

might confer tamoxifen-resistance, we transduced

then evaluated their metabolic phenotype. As a more
efficient screening method, we chose to measure ATP and
glutathione levels, to ask which of these candidates would
be sufficient to mimic the metabolic phenotype of TAMR
cells. As predicted, this screening method was successful
and three out of the six candidates (BCAS1, NQO1 and
GCLC) actually increased ATP and decreased reduced
glutathione (Figure 6). Since NQO1 and GCLC conferred
the largest changes in ATP and reduced glutathione, we
decided to focus on these two metabolic enzymes as
potential mediators of tamoxifen-resistance. NQO1 and
GCLC were increased by 74-fold and by 29-fold in TAMR
cells, respectively, relative to parental MCF-7 cells (Table
1).

Based on our proteomics analysis and screening
approach, NQO1 and GCLC emerged as the most
promising potential targets. Thus, we subjected these
MCF-7-NQO1 and MCF-7-GCLC cell lines to further
characterization. We performed additional mechanistic
studies, to determine if they truly mimic the tamoxifenresistance behavior and metabolic phenotype of TAMR
cells.

MCF-7 cell lines tested in parallel were tamoxifen-

of reduced glutathione (Figures 8, 9 and 10). Finally,
mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial membrane
potential were also increased in MCF-7-NQO1 cells
(Figure 11).
Importantly, virtually identical results were also
obtained with GCLC. MCF-7 cells transduced with the
cDNA of GCLC were i) tamoxifen-resistant (Figure 12)
and ii) showed a significant increase in mitochondrial
oxygen consumption (Figure 13 and 14). Moreover, MCF7-GCLC cells had enhanced ATP production and showed
decreased reduced glutathione (Figure 15), with increased
mitochondrial biogenesis (Figure 16).
In accordance with the above functional data, a
number of mitochondrial and/or other metabolism-related
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteins were highly up-regulated, as seen by proteomics
analysis, in both NQO1 and GCLC transfected MCF-7
cells (Tables 2 and 3). These up-regulated mitochondrial
proteins included ABAT, AIFM1, ATPIF1, GSR, MRPS22
and PRDX5, among others. 		
In summary, the NQO1 and GCLC genes are both
indeed sufficient to confer tamoxifen-resistance and to
“boost” mitochondrial metabolism. Conversely, we also
observed that treatment of MCF-7-TAMR cells with
dicoumarol, a known NQO1 inhibitor, reverses their
tamoxifen-resistance phenotype (Supplementary Figures
2 and 3). Thus, pharmacological inhibition of NQO1 and
GCLC may be new therapeutic strategies for overcoming
tamoxifen-resistance in breast cancer patients.

the Luminal B sub-population of ER(+) breast cancer
patients. In contrast, NQO2 mRNA levels did not show
any prognostic value in any of the ER(+) patient groups
examined (Table 4; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Finally, since high levels of NQO1 mRNA were
associated with disease progression in patients that
received endocrine therapy, this is indicative of a clinical
association with endocrine therapy-resistance. Thus,
elevated levels of NQO1 expression could be used to
identify high-risk ER(+) breast cancer patients, that might
benefit from treatment with novel NQO1 inhibitors.

and/or GCLC could autonomously confer the tamoxifenresistance phenotype, we transduced MCF-7 cells with the
cDNAs encoding these proteins, using a lenti-viral vector
approach. Remarkably, NQO1 and GCLC lenti-viral
transduction was indeed sufficient to induce tamoxifenresistance, as well as the metabolically-enhanced
mitochondrial phenotype.
Thus, increased mitochondrial function may help
drive tamoxifen-resistance in human breast cancer cells
(Figure 20). This key finding has important mechanistic
implications for understanding the molecular basis of
tamoxifen-resistance. Furthermore, the over-expression of
NQO1 mRNA species predicted tumor recurrence in highrisk ER(+) that were LN(+) and had received endocrinetherapy (mostly tamoxifen), but not chemotherapy. As
such, our findings may have translational and clinical
relevance for over-coming the resistance to endocrine
therapy in ER(+) breast cancer patients [24].
It remains unknown exactly how NQO1 and GCLC
drive an enhanced mitochondrial metabolic phenotype.
The NQO1 protein product is an enzyme known as
NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1. It is the main nonmitochondrial enzyme responsible for the reduction of
CoQ10 in cells. Thus, NQO1 may “boost” mitochondrial
metabolism by providing increased reduced CoQ10
species to facilitate oxidative mitochondrial metabolism
[25, 26].
The GCLC protein product is an enzyme known as
glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. Glutamatecysteine ligase is also known as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, and is the first and rate-limiting step
for glutathione synthesis. While it remains unknown how
GCLC regulates mitochondrial function, its deletion in
mouse liver leads to striking decreases in mitochondrial
function, mitochondrial injury, loss of cellular ATP, and
a marked increase in lipid peroxidation, driving steatosis
and liver failure. Interestingly, treatment of these mice
with oral N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) restores mitochondrial
function and prevents mortality caused by the loss of
hepatocyte GSH synthesis [27, 28].
NQO1 and GCLC are normally up-regulated as part
of the Nrf2-anti-oxidant response, which occurs during
oxidative stress [12, 24]. Thus, the observed up-regulation
of NQO1 and GCLC in TAMR cells may directly reflect
that tamoxifen treatment can induce oxidative stress. How
does tamoxifen induce oxidative stress? Several different
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the manner
in which tamoxifen induces oxidative stress in cells,
including the targeting of NOS, SOD2 and ER-beta in
mitochondria.
Tamoxifen also has direct effects on mitochondrial
function. Tamoxifen acts both as an uncoupling agent
and as a potent inhibitor of electron transport, ultimately
leading to a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane
potential and cellular apoptosis [29-31]. More specifically,
tamoxifen inhibits electron transfer at the levels of both

DISCUSSION
In this report, we set out to identify new metabolic
drivers of tamoxifen-resistance, by combining proteomics
analysis with metabolic phenotyping [22, 23]. Use of
this proteomics-metabolomics approach allowed us to
identify enhanced mitochondrial metabolism as a key
characteristic of TAMR cells, that was characterized
by i) increased oxygen consumption, ii) increased ATP
production, and iii) augmented mitochondrial biogenesis,
as well as increased oxidative stress, as revealed by iv)
decreased levels of reduced glutathione levels (Figure
20). Thus, we focused the interpretation of our proteomics
results on key metabolic enzymes that were dramatically
increased in tamoxifen-resistant cells, such as NQO1 and
GCLC. To determine if the over-expression of NQO1

Figure 20: Enhanced mitochondrial metabolism: A
new mechanism for driving tamoxifen-resistance. A
schematic diagram is shown high-lighting our observations
that increased mitochondrial oxygen-consumption and ATPproduction, as well as increased mitochondrial biogenesis and
oxidative stress, all contribute to the metabolic phenotype of
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. In this process, the overexpression of NQO1 and GCLC appear to be key drivers of this
phenotype.

complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase) and
complex IV (cytochrome-c oxidase). Similarly, it has also
been reported that tamoxifen elevates mitochondrial ROS,
mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cytochrome c release,
while driving the tyrosine-nitration of key mitochondrial
proteins.
Therefore, our current findings could mechanistically
explain why “boosting” mitochondrial metabolism may
lead to tamoxifen-resistance in human breast cancer cells.
If tamoxifen indeed behaves as a mitochondrial “poison”,
then increased mitochondrial “power” could help to buffer
against the mitochondrial toxicity effects of tamoxifen,
thereby conferring tamoxifen-resistance.

Lentiviral plasmids, packaging cells and reagents
were purchased from Genecopoeia. 48 hours after
seeding, 293Ta packaging cells were transfected with
lentiviral vectors encoding NQO1 or GCLC or empty
vector (EX-NEG-Lv105), using Lenti-PacTM HIV
Expression Packaging Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Two days post-transfection, lentiviruscontaining culture medium was passed through a 0.45 µm
filter and added to the target cells (MCF-7 cells) in the
presence of 5µg/ml Polybrene. Infected cells were selected
with a concentration of 1.5 µg/ml of puromycin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cellular growth using the sulforhodamine B
(SRB) assay

Materials

SRB (S9012, Sigma) measures total biomass by
staining cellular proteins. After 2, 5 and 8 days, cells
were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid (T9159, Sigma)
for 1h at 4°C, stained with SRB (S9012, Sigma) for 15
minutes, and washed 3 times with 1% acetic acid (27225,
Sigma). The incorporated die was solubilized with 10
mM Tris Base, pH 8.8 (T1503, Sigma). Absorbance was
spectrophotometrically measured at 540 nm in a FluoStar
Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). Background
measurements were subtracted from all values.
Dicoumarol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.

MCF7 cells (catalogue # HTB-22), a human breast
cancer cell line, were originally obtained from the ATCC
cell repository. Tamoxifen and dicoumarol were obtained
commercially from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.

Label-free semi-quantitative proteomics analysis
Cell lysates were prepared for trypsin digestion
by sequential reduction of disulphide bonds with TCEP
and alkylation with MMTS. Then, the peptides were
extracted and prepared for LC-MS/MS. All LC-MS/MS
analyses were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to
an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific,
formerly Dionex, The Netherlands). Xcalibur raw data
files acquired on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL were directly
imported into Progenesis LCMS software (Waters Corp)
for peak detection and alignment. Data were analyzed
using the Mascot search engine. Five technical replicates
were analyzed for each sample type [32].

Seahorse XF96 metabolic flux analysis (OCR and
ECAR)
Real-time oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and
extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) measurements
were determined using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux
(XF96) analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, MA, USA).
1 x 104 cells per well were seeded into XFe-96 well
cell culture plates, and incubated overnight to allow
attachment. Control cells were processed in parallel. After
48 hours of incubation, cells were washed in pre-warmed
XF assay media (or for OCR measurement, XF assay
media supplemented with 10mM glucose, 1mM Pyruvate,
2mM L-glutamine and adjusted at 7.4 pH). Cells were then
maintained in 175 µL/well of XF assay media at 37°C, in a
non-CO2 incubator for 1 hour. During the incubation time,
we loaded 25 µL of 80mM glucose, 9µM oligomycin,
and 1M 2-deoxyglucose (for ECAR measurement) or
10µM oligomycin, 9µM FCCP, 10µM rotenone, 10µM
antimycin A (for OCR measurement), in XF assay media
into the injection ports in the XFe-96 sensor cartridge.
Data sets were analyzed by XF96 software and GraphPad
Prism software, using one-way ANOVA and Student’s
t-test calculations. All experiments were performed in
quintuplicate, three times independently.

Ingenuity pathway analyses
Pathway and function analyses were generated
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity
systems, http://www.ingenuity.com), which assists with
proteomics data interpretation via grouping differentially
expressed genes or proteins into known functions and
pathways. Pathways with a z score > 1.5 were considered
as significantly activated, and pathways with a z score <
-1.5 were considered as significantly inhibited.

ATP and glutathione levels

per experiment, unless otherwise stated. Statistical
significance was measured using the analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant and all
statistical tests were two sided.

Cell activity was measured using a CellTiter-Glo™
assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI #G7571) and GSH/
GSSG-Glo™ Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI #V6612)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. For ATP detection,
2 x 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated
for 24h. After 24 hours, Celltiter-Glo reagent was added to
each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature
for 10 minutes with constant shaking before detected the
luminescence intensity. For GSH/GSSH ratio content, 1
x 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated
for 24h. After 24 hours, Total and Oxidized Glutathione
reagents were added to each well and incubated for 30
minutes. Luciferin was added to each well and the plate
was read after 15 minutes. Luminescence intensity was
read using a FluoStar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech)
taking the luminescence reading of control as the 100%
value. Background measurements were subtracted from
all values. The experiments were performed using 4 x 104
cells also and 48 hours of incubation. The results followed
the same trend (data not shown). All experiments were
performed in sixtuplicate, four times independently.

Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis
To perform K-M analysis on NQO1, NQO2 and
GCLC gene transcripts, we used an open-access online
survival analysis tool to interrogate publically available
microarray data from > 5,000 breast cancer patients. This
allowed us to determine their prognostic value. For this
purpose, we primarily analyzed data from ER(+) patients
that were LN(+) at diagnosis and were of the luminal
A sub-type, that were primarily treated with tamoxifen
and not other chemotherapy (N = 152 patients). Biased
and outlier array data were excluded from the analysis.
Hazard-ratios were calculated, at the best auto-selected
cut-off, and p-values were calculated using the logrank test
and plotted in R. K-M curves were also generated online
using the K-M-plotter (as high-resolution TIFF files),
using univariate analysis: http://kmplot.com/analysis/
index.php?p = service&cancer = breast. This allowed us
to directly perform in silico validation of these biomarker
candidates. The most updated version of the database was
utilized for all these analyses.

Mitochondrial staining
Mitochondrial activity was assessed with
MitoTracker Orange (#M7510, Invitrogen), whose
accumulation in mitochondria isdependent upon
membrane potential. Mitochondrial mass was determined
using MitoTracker Deep-Red (#M22426, Invitrogen),
localizing to mitochondria regardless of mitochondrial
membrane potential. 2 x 105 cells were seeded in a 6 well
plate and leave at 37°C for 72 hours. Control cells were
processed in parallel. After 72 hours, cells were incubated
with prewarmed MitoTracker staining solution (diluted
in PBS/CM to a final concentration of 10 nM) for 30-60
minutes at 37°C. All subsequent steps were performed
in the dark. Cells were washed in PBS, harvested, and
re-suspended in 300 μL of PBS/CM. Cells were then
analyzed by flow cytometry. Data analysis was performed
using FlowJo software.
