Abstract
Small molecule inhibitors of HER2 are clinically active in
women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who have
progressed on trastuzumab treatment. However, the effectiveness of this class of agents is limited by either primary
resistance or acquired resistance. Using an unbiased genetic
approach, we performed a genome wide loss-of-function short
hairpin RNA screen to identify novel modulators of resistance
to lapatinib, a recently approved anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitor. Here, we have identified the tumor suppressor PTEN
as a modulator of lapatinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. In
addition, we show that two dominant activating mutations
in PIK3CA (E545K and H1047R), which are prevalent in
breast cancer, also confer resistance to lapatinib. Furthermore, we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–
induced lapatinib resistance can be abrogated through the use
of NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR. Our data
show that deregulation of the PI3K pathway, either through
loss-of-function mutations in PTEN or dominant activating
mutations in PIK3CA, leads to lapatinib resistance, which
can be effectively reversed by NVP-BEZ235. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The HER2 (ErbB2/neu) gene is amplified/overexpressed in 20%
to 30% of invasive breast carcinomas with its overexpression being
associated with increased metastatic potential and poor clinical
outcome (1, 2). As a result HER2 is an attractive target for
therapeutic drug development. A myriad of inhibitors targeting
HER2 have been developed, most notably, the humanized
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), which targets the
extracellular domain of HER2. The mechanisms underlying
trastuzumab activity include down-regulation of HER2 expression
via endocytosis (3), deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT pathway, either through disruption of HER2
signaling or by increased PTEN membrane localization (4), or the
induction of a G1 growth arrest through the stabilization of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (5). Interestingly, trastuzu-

mab has also been shown to induce apoptosis in multiple breast
cancer cell lines via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxity
(6). Clinical studies have established that trastuzumab provides
substantial clinical benefits in patients with HER2-overexpressing
metastatic breast cancers. However, the objective response rate to
single-agent trastuzumab is low, with only 12% to 34% of patients
responding to monotherapy (7, 8).
A number of mechanisms have been identified, which consequently limit the effect of trastuzumab-based therapy in patients,
including hyperactivation of HER2 family members or the
dimerization of HER2 with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)
receptor (IGFRI; refs. 9, 10). Furthermore, the recent identification
of a truncated form of the HER2 receptor that lacks the
extracellular trastuzumab-binding domain (p95 CTF) has been
reported to affect trastuzumab sensitivity (11).
Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported to occur at high
frequency in a number of human cancers (12). Increasing evidence
indicates that a functional PI3K-AKT pathway is also critical for
trastuzumab sensitivity. Hyperactivation of PI3K signaling, downstream from HER2, either through loss-of-function PTEN mutations or dominant activating mutations in the catalytic subunit of
PI3K, PIK3CAa, seems to decrease trastuzumab activity in breast
cancer (4, 13). Interestingly, in primary breast cancer, a significant
correlation between HER2 overexpression and the presence of PI3K
mutations has been described, insinuating that multiple oncogenic
inputs are required to overcome the strong tumor suppressor
capability of wild-type (wt) PTEN (14).
Lapatinib is an orally active small molecule inhibitor of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 tyrosine kinase
domains. Treatment with lapatinib has been shown to deregulate
baseline and ligand-stimulated HER2 activity, resulting in the
inhibition of downstream effector pathways (15). Initial experiments
have shown that lapatinib potently inhibits cell survival in
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells through the induction of
apoptosis (16, 17). Furthermore, in contrast to trastuzumab,
lapatinib effectively inhibits the transactivation of EGFR and HER2
by IGF-I signaling (16). Recent data has also described the ability of
lapatinib to potently inhibit the tumor forming potential of p95 CTFderived breast cancer cell lines in mouse xenograft models (11).
A series of clinical trials has shown that lapatinib is active
in patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer, and a pivotal
phase III study in patients with advanced disease has shown
that lapatinib, in combination with capecitabine, prolongs
progression-free survival in patients who have progressed on
trastuzumab (18, 19). However, as with trastuzumab, patients with
advanced disease who initially respond to this TKI almost

invariably develop resistance. Therefore, a clear understanding of
the mechanisms underlying lapatinib secondary or acquired
resistance will be advantageous on deciding which patients may
benefit the most. Moreover, prior identification of patients who are
unlikely to respond to lapatinib therapy due to upfront or primary
resistance may lead to the development of rational drug
combinations that are likely to circumvent resistance. Here, using
an unbiased functional genetic approach, we have identified that
dominant activating mutations in the PI3K pathway lead to
lapatinib resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that
the combination therapy of lapatinib plus the dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 leads to the complete growth arrest in PI3K
pathway–induced lapatinib resistance.

Materials and Methods
Short hairpin RNA barcode screen. The pooled NKI library
representing 23,742 vectors was retrovirally infected into BT474 cells and
selected with puromycin (2.0 Ag/mL) for 3 d. After selection, cells were
trypsinized and plated into two populations at a density of 2  105 in a
15-cm dish. A total of 2  106 cells were plated for each population. One
population remained untreated, whereas the other population was cultured
in 27 nmol/L lapatinib. Medium was refreshed every 3 d. After 2 wk, cells
were trypsinized and replated out at 2  105 in a 15-cm dish. After a total
of 4 wk in culture, the treated and untreated populations were collected
and genomic DNA was isolated using DNAzol (Life Technologies). The short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) inserts were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR.
Primers used for PCR are as follows: forward, GGC CAG TGA ATT GTA
ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGG CGG CCC TTG AAC CTC CTC GTT
CGA CC; reverse, TAA AGC GCA TGC TCC AGA CT. Purified PCR products
were used for linear RNA amplification, and purified products were labeled
with cyanine-3 or cyanine-5 fluorescent isotopes (Kreatech). Labeled RNA
probes from both untreated and lapatinib-treated cells were combined and
hybridized to microarrays. Quantification of the microarray images was
performed with Imagene 5.6 (Biodiscovery). Microarray data were normalized and log2 transformed. Barcode protocols can be accessed online.3
Plasmids and antibodies. pJP1520, pJP1520-PIK3CAa, pJP1520-E545K,
and pJP1520-H1047R were kind gifts from Joan Brugge. The second
PTEN hairpin was a kind gift from Roderik Kortlever. The antibodies
anti–phosphorylated AKT (S473), anti–phosphorylated AKT (S308), anti–
phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), anti–phosphorylated S6240/244, anti-S6, IRS1, and PTEN were from Cell Signaling. Anti-AKT
and anti-ERK were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-tubulin was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Anti-pTyr was purchased from Upstate.
Cell culture and transient tranfections. The HER2-positive cell lines
BT474 [PTEN+, PI3K(K111N), KRAS wt, HRAS wt, NRAS wt] and SkBR3
(PTEN +, PI3K wt, p53 mutant, KRAS wt, HRAS wt, NRAS wt) cells were
cultured in DMEM-F12 + Glutamax, whereas phoenix cells were cultured in
DMEM. Both media were supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/
streptomycin. Phoenix cells were divided in 10-cm dishes 1 d before
transfection. Subconfluent cells were tranfected with 25 Ag of pRetroSuper
DNA using the calcium phosphate transfection method (20). Cells were
incubated overnight and washed twice in PBS. At 48 h after transfection, the
viral supernatant was collected, purified with a 45-Am filter, and
supplemented with polybrene (0.8 Ag/mL). Infection of desired cells was
repeated three to five times. Infected cells were selected with puromycin
(2 Ag/mL) for 3 d. When desired, stable cell lines were treated with
trastuzumab (5 Ag/mL; Herceptin, kindly provided by Genentech, Inc.),
lapatinib (27 nmol/L; Tykerb, kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline), or NVPBEZ235 (15 nmol/L; kindly provided by Novartis), or in combination
overnight unless otherwise indicated. PI-103 was purchased from Echelon
Biosciences.

Commassie staining. BT474 or SkBR3 cells were cultured in the
presence of trastuzumab (5 mg/mL), lapatinib (27 nmol/L), or both for 3 to
4 wk. Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with methanol and acetic
acid (3:1). After 30 min, cells were washed once in water, and 10 mL
commassie stain (0.2% commassie, 50% methanol, and 10% acetic acid)
were added. After 30 min, cells were washed thrice in H2O and air-dried.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in solubilizing buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS,
1 mmol/L sodium vanadate, 1 mmol/L PPi, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride,
100 mmol/L h-glycerol phosphate], supplemented with protease inhibitors
(Complete, Roche). Whole-cell extracts were then separated on 7% to 12%
SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore). Membranes were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
probed with specific antibodies. Blots were then incubated with a
horseradish peroxidase–linked second antibody and resolved with chemiluminescence (Pierce).
Growth curves. BT474 cells were retrovirally infected and selected, and
polyclonal cell lines were seeded in 12-well plates (2  104). At 24 h later,
cells were treated with either 27 nmol/L lapatinib, 5 Ag/mL trastuzumab, or
15 nmol/L NVP-BEZ235 where appropriate. Cell numbers were quantified at
the indicated time points by fixing cells with 4% glutaraldehyde, washing
the cells twice in H2O, and staining the cells with crystal violet (0.1% Sigma).
The dye was subsequently extracted with 10% acetic acid, and its
absorbance was determined (570 nm). Growth curves were performed in
triplicate.
Tumor xenografts in nude mice. Mice were maintained under the
institutional guidelines set by the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital Care
and Use Committee. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c athymic mice
(nu+/nu+, n = 32) were acquired from Charles Rivers Laboratories. Mice
were housed in air-filtered laminar flow cabinets with a 12-h light cycle and
food and water ad libitum. Mice were acclimatized for 2 wk. A 17 h-estradiol
pellet (Innovative Research of America) was inserted s.c. to each mouse 1 d
before injection with BT474 VH2 (pRS-GFP) or BT474 VH2 (pRS-PTEN-B;
ref. 21). For BT474 VH2 clones, 2  107 cells were injected s.c., and
treatment was initiated when the tumors achieved a mean size of 400 mm3.
Lapatinib was given daily by oral gavage in 0.5% hydroxypropylmethycellulose, 0.1% Tween 80. Tumor xenografts were measured with calipers every
2 to 3 d, and tumor volume was determined using the formula: (length 
width2)  (p / 6). When appropriate, mice were anesthetized with 1.5%
isofluorane-air mixture and killed by cervical dislocation. Tumors were
homogenized in solubilizing buffer (see above).

Results
Loss of PTEN expression confers resistance to Lapatinib.
To identify genes whose suppression by shRNA cause resistance to
lapatinib, we infected BT474 HER2 overexpressing breast cancer
cells with a retroviral library that comprises 23,742 shRNA vectors
targeting 7,914 genes (22). After selection with puromycin, cells
were plated out at low density and treated with 27 nmol/L
lapatinib. The IC50 value of BT474 cells was predetermined to be
f25 nmol/L (data not shown; refs. 17, 23). To rapidly identify
shRNAs that are capable of circumventing the proliferation arrest
induced by lapatinib, we used shRNA barcode technology (24).
After 4 weeks, DNA was harvested from the surviving lapatinibtreated cells and, as control, from untreated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). shRNA cassettes were recovered by PCR, and RNA probes
were generated by linear amplification and fluorescent labeling.
The relative representation of each shRNA in the population was
measured using a microarray. To minimize experimental variation,
we combined the data from two individual experiments. Supplementary Fig. S1B shows the relative abundance of the shRNA
vectors in the lapatinib-treated population compared with
untreated controls. Interestingly, we identified eight shRNA vectors
(C20ORF44, DNMT3A, GRAP2, PPP1R14B, PTEN, TK1, ZAP70, and

ZIC3) for which the same shRNA vector was identified in both
individual barcode screens (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
However, when tested in second round selection of the eight
shRNA vectors tested, only the hairpin targeting PTEN conferred
resistance to lapatinib (Fig. 1A; data not shown). As expected,
loss of PTEN expression also abrogated trastuzumab sensitivity
(Fig. 1A). Critically, a second nonoverlapping shRNA, capable of
inhibiting PTEN expression (Fig. 1B), also conferred resistance to
lapatinib and trastuzumab, therefore arguing against an off-target
effect (Fig. 1A; ref. 25). An shRNA targeting GFP was used as a
negative control in all experiments. Interestingly, treatment with
both trastuzumab and lapatinib conferred an enhanced response to
the proliferation potential of HER2-positive cells compared with
either treatment alone, confirming the results of others, which have
indicated that combining lapatinib with trastuzumab enhances
their biological effect (Fig. 1A; ref. 26). However, whereas
combination treatment with lapatinib and trastuzumab limited
cellular proliferation in PTEN knockdown cells, viable cells
remained (Fig. 1A).
To investigate the sensitivity of the PTEN knockdown cell lines
to the different HER2-targeted therapies, we analyzed the
proliferation potential of PTEN knockdown cells when treated
with trastuzumab (5 Ag/mL), lapatinib (27 nmol/L), or both for
4 weeks. Treatment with HER2-directed therapies completely

inhibited the proliferation potential of control cells. However, the
ablation of PTEN expression in BT474 cells decreased the growth
inhibitory properties of both trastuzumab and lapatinib (Fig. 1C).
Collectively these data suggest that PTEN expression is required for
both trastuzumab and lapatinib sensitivity in BT474 cells.
As has previously been reported, lapatinib growth inhibition
correlates with the down-regulation of HER2-dependent PI3K
signaling (17, 26). Therefore, to study the effects of lapatinib on
PI3K signaling in cells that lack PTEN activity, we treated BT474
cells or BT474 PTEN-depleted cells with lapatinib (Fig. 1D). Indeed,
similar to trastuzumab, there was a significant down-regulation in
AKT473 phosphorylation in lapatinib-treated control cells compared with untreated control cells. In contrast down-regulation of
AKT phosphorylation was attenuated in lapatinib-treated PTEN
knockdown cells compared with lapatinib-treated controls. However, unlike trastuzumab, no change was observed in mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation upon treatment
with lapatinib. In addition, treatment of cells with both lapatinib
and trastuzumab resulted in an additive inhibitory effect on AKT
activity, suggesting that trastuzumab and lapatinib may function
through partially nonoverlapping mechanisms to disrupt HER2dependent PI3K signaling.
The approved dose in patients of lapatinib, when used in
combination with capecitabine, is a daily dose of 1,250 mg (18).

populations. *, P < 0.02. D, Western blot analysis of mouse xenograft BT474 VH2 tumors stably infected with vector PTENkdB or relevant controls. Whole-cell extracts
were analyzed with indicated antibodies.

This dosage results in a minimal plasma drug concentration of
f500 nmol/L (27). Therefore, to test if PTEN loss can overcome
lapatinib sensitivity at clinically relevant concentrations, we
performed a colony formation assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, loss of
PTEN expression significantly enhanced the growth potential of
BT474 cells when treated at clinically relevant doses of lapatinib,
which correlates with an increase in AKT activity (Fig. 2B).
To investigate if PTEN deficiency leads to lapatinib resistance
in vivo, we retrovirally infected BT474 cells with an shRNAtargeting PTEN or a relevant control and injected athymic nude
mice s.c. When tumor xenografts reached a mean size of 400 mm3
(f14 days), we treated the mice with lapatinib (50 mg/kg) or
vehicle daily. BT474 PTEN-depleted cells exhibited similar growth
rates to controls in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2C). However, loss of
PTEN significantly inhibited the antitumorigenic effects of
lapatinib compared with controls (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, Western
blot analysis of tumors clearly shows a decrease in AKT
dephosphorylation in PTEN knockdown tumors compared with
controls (Fig. 2D). Together, these data show that loss of PTEN
expression attenuates lapatinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo
possibly by maintaining the activation of the AKT signaling
pathway.
Breast cancer–relevant PI3K mutations confer resistance to
lapatinib. The PI3K pathway is frequently mutated in cancer.
Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN have been described in a
variety of cancers, resulting in hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

(28). In addition, a number of recent reports have indicated that
activating mutations in PI3K subunit PIK3CAa occur in 18% to
40% of primary breast cancers (29). The majority of these
mutations reside within two hotspot regions, leading to single
amino acid substitutions within the helical domain (E545K) and
kinase domain (H1047R) resulting in enhanced PI3K signaling (30).
Importantly, deregulation of the PI3K pathway seems to be a poor
prognostic indicator toward trastuzumab sensitivity (13).
To investigate whether cancer-associated PI3K mutations result
in lapatinib resistance, we retrovirally transduced BT474 cells with
hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged PIK3CAa or the breast cancer–
relevant isoforms, HA-E545K, or HA-H1047R. Both PI3K-dominant
activating mutations rendered BT474 cells nearly completely
refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib and
trastuzumab (Fig. 3A). However, unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib
seems to limit the growth potential of PIK3CAa-overexpressing
BT474 cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, expression of PIK3CA (E545K)
and PIK3CA (H1047R) also conferred resistance to the growth
arrest conferred by the combined treatment of lapatinib and
trastuzumab (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in the HER2overexpressing cell line SKBR3 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we analyzed the proliferation potential of BT474 cells
retrovirally infected with the different PI3K alleles when treated
with trastuzumab (5 Ag/mL), lapatinib (27 nmol/L), or both for
3 weeks. As expected, expression of activated PI3K mutants
abrogated the growth inhibitory effects of these anti-HER2

therapies when used as treatment, either alone or in combination
(Fig. 3B). In contrast, in PIK3CAa-overexpressing cells, both
trastuzumab and lapatinib were active although lapatinib was
superior at the concentrations tested (Fig. 3B). In cells harboring
mutant PI3K, there was no difference in proliferation relative to wt
expressing cells in nontreated samples. Together, these data
suggest that PI3K breast cancer prevalent mutations can
counteract lapatinib and trastuzumab sensitivity in HER2-positive
cells.
Because both PTEN loss-of-function mutations and oncogenic
mutations in PI3K leads to constitutive AKT signaling, we
reasoned that AKT inhibition by lapatinib might be attenuated in
the presence of dominant activating mutations in PI3K (29, 31).
Indeed, both E545K and H1047R mutant alleles bypassed the
inhibitory effects of lapatinib and trastuzumab on AKT activity as
measured by AKT473 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Consistent with
this, both E545K and H1047R mutants decreased the sensitivity
of lapatinib toward AKT activity at clinically relevant concentrations (Fig. 4C and D), resulting in a marked increase in cellular
survival (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no difference was observed in

phosphorylated AKT levels in PIK3CAa-overexpressing cells
compared with controls in lapatinib-treated samples (Fig. 3C).
Collectively, these data suggest that hyperactivation of the PI3KAKT pathway by hotspot mutations is a critical regulator of the
anti-HER2 therapies, trastuzumab and lapatinib. Interestingly,
whereas similar effects were observed in PIK3CAa overexpressing
cells treated with trastuzumab, only a minor degree of resistance
was noted in lapatinib-treated samples.
Lapatinib and the PI3K inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 collaborate
to suppress the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis driven by loss-offunction PTEN mutations. The above data clearly shows that
hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway confers lapatinib resistance.
Therefore, we reasoned that the use of PI3K antagonists would
restore the sensitivity of HER2-directed therapies. To do this, we
made use of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. NVPBEZ235 is an imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline derivative that binds
equivalently to the ATP-binding cleft of these enzymes and is
presently undergoing phase I clinical trials (32). Of note, we
have recently reported that the IC50 for phosphorylated Akt
(Ser473) was 6.4-fold higher than that of phosphorylated S6

As shown in Fig. 5A, BT474 cells are exquisitely sensitive to
NVP-BEZ235 treatment alone, which is only slightly improved by
the addition of trastuzumab or lapatinib. In contrast and in line
with previous observations, BT474 PTEN knockdown cells
inhibited trastuzumab, lapatinib, or NVP-BEZ235–mediated
growth inhibition compared with control cells. However, combination treatment in BT474 PTEN knockdown cells with either
trastuzumab and NVP-BEZ235 or lapatinib and NVP-BEZ235 was
additive (Fig. 5A). Similar observations were noted when we
analyzed the proliferation potential of BT474 cells expressing
hairpins targeting PTEN exposed to either lapatinib, NVP-BEZ235,
or the combination (Fig. 5B).
To elucidate the mechanisms behind the additive effect observed
between lapatinib and NVP-BEZ235, we compared the intercellular
responses of BT474 or BT474 PTEN-depleted cells treated with
lapatinib or NVP-BEZ235 alone or in combination (Fig. 5C). In wt
cells, as expected, HER2 inhibition by lapatinib reduced phosphorylation of AKT473 and downstream mTOR signaling exhibited
by reduced S6240/244 phosphorylation. Similarly, NVP-BEZ235
(100 nmol/L) treatment reduced phosphorylation of both AKT473
and S6240/244, which was accompanied by an increase in the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

phosphorylation of ERK in control cells, but not in PTEN
knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). Similar observations were seen with
another dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, PI-103, albeit at higher
concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). Recent data show
that mTOR inhibition results in a mobility shift of IRS1 due to
decreased serine phosphorylation (34). The loss of IRS1 serine
phosphorylation inhibits degradation of the protein. Consequently,
IRS1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues nullifying the
inhibitory feedback loop and permitting the downstream activation
of AKT (35). In agreement with this, BT474 cells treated with
NVP-BEZ235 exhibited a decreased mobility shift, stabilization of
IRS1, and increased IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S3C). Surprisingly, NVP-BEZ235 did not augment IRS1 tyrosine
phosphorylation in PTEN knockdown cells. IRS-1 is the major
substrate of IGFRI signaling, promoting the activation of downstream effector pathways (36). Recent observations have shown
that treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001)
induces MAPK activation through a negative feedback loop
that relies on an S6K-PI3K-Ras-Raf-MEK1/2–dependent mechanism (37). The observed increase in ERK phosphorylation in
NVP-BEZ235–treated samples is likely to be a consequence of
mTOR inhibition, resulting in the suppression of this negative
feedback loop.
In contrast, loss of PTEN attenuated AKT dephosphorylation
but not S6 dephosphorylation in NVP-BEZ235–treated cells.
This suggests that at the concentration tested, the inhibitory
properties of NVP-BEZ235 are insufficient to completely abrogate

the kinase activity of PI3K. In line with these results, treatment of
cells with a higher concentration of NVP-BEZ235 (500 nmol/L)
reduced phosphorylation of AKT473 to levels comparable with
those seen in control cell lines (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that
only a limited degree of PI3K activity is sufficient to maintain
activated AKT in the absence of PTEN phosphatase activity. More
importantly, however, the combination treatment of BT474 PTEN
knockdown cells with lapatinib and NVP-BEZ235 caused a marked
decrease in AKT473 phosphorylation similar to that observed with
either lapatinib or NVP-BEZ235 treatment alone in control cells.
Collectively, these data show an additive effect with lapatinib and
NVP-BEZ235 in cell lines with decreased PTEN expression through
the inhibition of both upstream and downstream signaling in the
HER2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, accounting for the lethal collaboration exhibited between these two drugs.
NVP-BEZ235 suppresses the PI3K-mTOR axis driven by
activating mutations in the PI3K pathway in trastuzumabresistant and lapatinib-resistant cells. Next, we wanted to

examine if NVP-BEZ235 would circumvent the observed resistance
of breast cancer–relevant mutations toward trastuzumab and
lapatinib. Importantly, recent observations have shown that
NVP-BEZ235 works equally well at repressing the activity of both
wt PIK3CA or the two mutant forms, E545K and H1047R (IC50, 4,
4.6, and 5.7 nmol/L, respectively; ref. 38). Retrovirally transduced
BT474 cells expressing either wt PIK3CAa or the breast cancer–
associated PI3K isoforms were treated with either trastuzumab
(5 mg/mL), lapatinib (27 nmol/L), NVP-BEZ235 (15 nmol/L), or in
combination (Fig. 6A). Unsurprisingly, treatment with NVP-BEZ235
alone completely inhibited cellular outgrowth of the PI3K mutant–
containing cells. These results are in line with previous observations, which show that PI3K mutant cell lines are highly sensitive to
mTOR inhibition by rapamycin analogues (29, 39). Similar
observations were later confirmed when we quantified the
proliferation rates of the PI3K mutant BT474 cell lines (Fig. 6B).
Next, we wanted to determine if treatment with NVP-BEZ235
would alleviate the enhanced downstream signaling exhibited in

Discussion
Lapatinib is approved for the therapy of patients with HER2positive breast cancer who have progressed on trastuzumab.
However, the effectiveness of this compound is limited by both
primary and acquired resistance. To identify novel mechanisms of
resistance to lapatinib, we have performed a genome-wide loss-offunction shRNA screen. Here, we have identified the tumor
suppressor PTEN as a mediator of lapatinib sensitivity in vitro
and in vivo. Previous reports have shown that lapatinib activity is
not dependent upon PTEN (19, 40). However, using an unbiased
approach, we clearly show that loss of PTEN and the resulting
activation of the PI3K pathway lead to deregulation of lapatinib
sensitivity in our model. Consistent with this, we have identified
that the two most prevalent breast cancer mutations in PIK3CA
(E545K and H1047R) also confer resistance to lapatinib. Therefore,
hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway by either loss of PTEN

function or activating mutations of PI3K result in resistance to
lapatinib. In addition, our findings are consistent with recently
reported observations using the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab (4, 13). However, it must be noted that, whereas
overexpression of wt PIK3CA diminished the effectiveness of
trastuzumab in BT474 cells, it was unable to circumvent the growth
inhibitory properties of lapatinib, suggesting that lapatinib may
function as a single agent in patients overexpressing wt PIK3CA.
A number of possibilities might explain the differing effect of
PTEN loss and lapatinib resistance observed between our group
and others, including the efficiency of PTEN knockdown in
targeted cell lines, the use of stably infected cell lines to determine
the long-term effects of PTEN knockdown and lapatinib treatment,
and the use of a 20-fold lower dose of lapatinib in the initial screen,
reducing the chance of nonspecific effects. Be that as it may, a
number of studies have identified that PTEN loss does not predict
for lapatinib response in patients (19, 40). Similar results have been
observed in trastuzumab resistance, whereby no significant
correlation has been observed in PTEN loss and time to
progression in trastuzumab-treated patients (13). These data
indicate that a larger cohort of patients may be needed to observe
differences in response in PTEN-deficient tumors. An additional
explanation is the lack of a validated test to determine PTEN

loss in human tumors. Until a validated test becomes available, it
will be difficult to try to establish reliable clinical correlations
between PTEN loss and response to lapatinib and other agents.
However, subsequent analysis combining both PTEN status and
PI3K status has clearly shown the potential of PI3K pathway
hyperactivation as a biomarker for trastuzumab efficacy. As such, it
will be of critical importance to equally assess PI3K pathway
hyperactivation as a predictor to lapatinib response.
Abnormal activation of the PI3K pathway is frequent in breast
cancer. Loss-of-function PTEN or PIK3CA mutations have been
observed in f20% to 25% and 18% to 40% of primary breast
cancers, respectively (13, 14, 29). Taking into consideration the
nearly mutual exclusivity between loss-of-function PTEN mutations
and PI3K mutations (14), it is not surprising that deregulation of
the PI3K pathway likely occurs in over 50% of breast cancers (29).
In addition, a significant correlation between HER2 overexpression
and the presence of PI3K mutations has been described (14).
There are several potential implications of these observations.
One such implication is that PTEN status and the presence of PI3K
activating mutations should be taken into account in clinical
studies with anti-HER2 agents because they could predict for
resistance. A second consequence of our findings is that hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway may be pharmacologically targeted,
which could in turn result in reversal of lapatinib resistance. This
has been a focus of our study. We have shown a nearly complete
loss of PI3K downstream signaling in BT474 cells, harboring a
deregulated PI3K pathway upon treatment with the dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 and lapatinib. Interestingly, treatment of NVP-BEZ235 alone in PI3K mutant cell lines was sufficient
to inhibit AKT phosphorylation. This is in contrast to cells with
PTEN loss, wherein the same NVP-BEZ235 dose fails to completely
abrogate AKT activity. Considering PI3K mutant cell lines retain
PTEN, this result highlights a collaboration between mechanisms
to down-regulate signaling through the cascade—NVP-BEZ235
inhibiting PIK3CA and PTEN dephosphorylating its downstream
target PIP3. Ultimately, this could affect clinical decision-making,
wherein lower doses of NVP-BEZ235 may be selected for
patients harboring activating mutations of PI3K, with higher doses
for those individuals with PTEN loss.

Recent data have highlighted the use of the PI3K inhibitors
LY294002 and wortmanin in the restoration of trastuzumab
sensitivity in PTEN-deficient cells (4). However, the use of these
compounds in the clinic has been limited by their poor
pharmacokinetics and excessive toxicity (reviewed in ref. 41).
Similarly, the use of rapamycin in patients with an activated PI3K
pathway has shown promising results in clinical trials (42). Again,
however, patients who rapidly progressed on rapamycin treatment
exhibited enhanced PRAS40 phosphorylation, a downstream target
of AKT. Although highly promising, these data suggest that
rapamycin efficacy in patients is limited due to the inhibition of
the negative feedback loop.
Here, our data suggest that combination therapy with NVPBEZ235, which is in early-stage clinical trials, and lapatinib should
be considered in patients whose tumors have a defined deregulated
PI3K pathway.
Deciphering the molecular basis of response to lapatinib and
other HER2-directed therapies is of great importance to maximizing the clinical efficacy of these compounds. In this present study,
we show the power of genome-wide loss of function screens to
identify critical components of lapatinib sensitivity. Furthermore,
our data justify the need for future clinical trials to validate the
PI3K pathway as a biomarker for lapatinib sensitivity and explore a
combined blockade with anti-PI3K inhibitors and lapatinib in a
selected patient population with tumors with HER2 amplification
and hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway by PTEN deletion or
activating PI3K mutations.
