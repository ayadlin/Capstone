BACKGROUND. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical proangiogenic factor in solid tumors. However, its expression and role in human neuroendocrine tumor development and progression remains unclear.

METHODS. Using immunohistochemistry, VEGF and Sp1 expression patterns were
investigated in 50 cases of human gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor having
various clinicopathologic characteristics.

RESULTS. It was found that strong VEGF expression was detected in tumor cells,

whereas no or very weak VEGF expression was detected in stromal cells surrounding or within the tumors. The levels of VEGF expression directly correlated
with the expression levels of Sp1 and microvessel density. Strong, weak, and negative VEGF expression was observed in 32%, 54%, and 14% of cases, respectively.

up duration of 50 months, the median PFS duration for the group with negative
expression was associated with poor PFS (P ¼ .02). Using in vitro and in vivo
models, human carcinoid cell lines were treated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal
antibody targeting VEGF. Bevacizumab did not inhibit the growth of carcinoid
cells in vitro but significantly reduced tumor angiogenesis and impaired tumor
growth in animals.

CONCLUSIONS. The data suggest that overexpression of VEGF promotes the
growth of human neuroendocrine tumors in part through up-regulation of angiogenesis. Cancer 2007;109:1478–86.  2007 American Cancer Society.

common adenocarcinomas. These are low-grade
neuroendocrine tumors that originate from the neuroendocrine cells throughout the body and are capable of producing a variety of hormones and biogenic
amines. Those arising from the pancreas are also
sometimes called islet cell carcinoma. Our recent
analyses of the SEER database have shown steady
increases in the diagnosed incidence of carcinoid
tumors. Incidence has risen from 0.8 per 100,000 in
1973 to 2.9 per 100,000 in 1999.2 This is likely at least
in part due to improved pathologic classification and
an increase in the diagnosis of rectal carcinoids during screening colonoscopy.
Neuroendocrine tumors have a wide range of
aggressiveness. For locoregional disease, a unified
staging system is missing. Disease is incurable in the
metastatic setting. Whereas some patients live for
months after the diagnosis of metastatic disease,
others live beyond 8 years. Somatostatin analogs are
commonly used to control hormonal-related symptoms, but tumor regression is rare. Carcinoids are
generally resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Systemic therapy options are lacking.
Inherited mutations in several tumor suppressor
genes including MEN1, vHL, TS2, and NF1 have
been associated with the development of carcinoid
tumors.3–6 The genetic abnormalities associated
with carcinogenesis and progression in sporadic
gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors are less well
understood; however, allelic deletions at chromosome 11q13 and 3p25 (the sites of the MEN1 and
vHL genes) have been observed.7–10 Gastrointestinal
neuroendocrine tumors are highly vascular tumors
with often accompanying desmoplastic reaction.
Previous studies indicated the role of several growth
factor families in carcinoid development and progression, including basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like
growth factor receptor (IGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).11–16 The molecular
mechanisms behind the abnormal expression of
multiple molecules remain unclear. Our recent study
of human gastric and pancreatic cancer suggested
that abnormal Sp1 activation augments the angiogenic and metastatic capacity of tumor cells through
overexpression of multiple Sp1 downstream genes,
including the key angiogenic factor VEGF.17,18 However, it is unknown whether and how Sp1 signaling
pathways contribute to neuroendocrine tumor development and progression.
In the present study we examined VEGF expression in human neuroendocrine tumors. We found
that elevated VEGF expression occurred in human

1479

neuroendocrine tumors and was inversely correlated
with progression-free survival (PFS), suggesting that
abnormally elevated VEGF expression may represent
a potential molecular marker for poor prognosis and
directly contribute to neuroendocrine tumor development and progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Tissue Specimens and Patient Information
Patients undergoing surgical resection of low-grade
neuroendocrine carcinoma at the University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were identified through our Neuroendocrine Database. Fifty patients with
representative tumor type and stage distribution
were selected. Low-grade neuroendocrine histology
was confirmed in all cases. Selected cases consisted
of 15 islet cell and 35 carcinoids. Primary tumors
from resection were used for these analyses. PFS duration was determined by review of medical records
and images from computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by a physician.

Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
The human bronchial carcinoid cancer cell line NCIH727 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,
Va, ATCC, CRL-5815) was purchased from the ATCC.
Human pancreatic carcinoid cell line BON-119 was
provided by Dr. Kjell Oberg (Uppsala University,
Uppsala, Sweden). The cell lines were maintained in
plastic flasks as adherent monolayers in minimal
essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino
acids, L-glutamine, and a vitamin solution (Flow
Laboratories, Rockville, Md).

Animals
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me). The
mice were housed in laminar flow cabinets under
specific pathogen-free conditions and used when
they were 8 weeks old. The animals were maintained
in facilities approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care in
accordance with the current regulations and standards of the US Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and National
Institutes of Health. All experiments involving use of
animals were performed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with approval from its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Western Blot Analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared from cell cultures.
Standard Western blotting was performed using polyclonal rabbit antibody against human VEGF (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) and antirabbit
IgG, a horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab0 )2 fragment
obtained from a donkey (Amersham Life Sciences,
Arlington Heights, Ill). Equal protein sample loading
was monitored by hybridizing the same membrane
filter with an anti-GAPDH antibody.17,18 The probe
proteins were detected using the Amersham
enhanced chemiluminescence system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunohistochemistry
Sections (5 lm thick) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohol. Antigen
retrieval was performed with 0.05% saponin for 30
minutes at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 12 minutes. The
specimens were incubated for 20 minutes at room
temperature with a protein-blocking solution consisting of PBS (pH 7.5) containing 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat serum and then incubated
at 48C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against
human VEGF, CD34, and Sp1 (clone PEP2). The samples were then rinsed and incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Next, the slides were
rinsed with PBS and incubated for 5 minutes with
diaminobenzidine (Research Genetics, Huntsville, Ala).
The sections were washed 3 times with distilled
water, counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Biogenex Laboratories, San Ramon, Calif), and washed
once each with distilled water and PBS. Afterward,
the slides were mounted using Universal Mount
(Research Genetics) and examined by using a brightfield microscope. A positive reaction was indicated
by a reddish-brown precipitate in the nuclei and/or
cytoplasm.17,18 Depending on the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity, staining was classified into 3 groups: negative, weak positive, and
strong positive. Specifically, the percentage of positive cells was divided into 5 grades (percentage
scores): <10% (0), 10% to 25% (1), 25% to 50% (2),
50% to 75% (3), and >75% (4). The intensity of staining was divided into 4 grades (intensity scores): no
staining (0), light brown (1), brown (2), and dark
brown (3). Sp1 staining positivity was determined by
the formula: overall scores ¼ percentage score
3 intensity score. An overall score of 3 was defined

as negative, of >3 to 6 as weak positive, and of >6
as strong positive.

Endothelial Cell Tube Formation and Proliferation Assays
Tumor cells (3 3 106) were cultured in 1 mL serumfree medium for 24 hours and the medium was collected and centrifuged to remove any cell debris
before its use as a conditioned medium. The tube
formation assay was performed as described previously.20 Briefly, 250 lL of growth factor-reduced
Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, Calif) was
pipetted into each well of a 24-well plate and polymerized for 30 minutes at 378C. Human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was harvested and
suspended in conditioned medium from either control cells or genetically altered cells cultured for 48
hours in modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Then 2 3 104 HUVECs in 300 lL of
conditioned medium was added to each well and
incubated at 378C, 5% CO2, for 20 hours. The cultures were photographed with brightfield microscopy
using a Sony digital camera equipped with an Optimas 6.2 program. To obtain optimal contrast and visual effect the color scheme of the original photos
was inverted so that the white color represents endothelial cells on black background. The degree of tube
formation was assessed as the percentage of cell surface area versus total surface area. For the proliferation assay, 2 3 104 HUVECs in 200 lL of conditioned
medium was added to 96-well plates and incubated
at 378C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours and [3H]-TdR was
added at 0.1 mCi/mL. [3H]-TdR incorporation was
determined 12 hours after the addition of [3H]-TdR.
Xenograft Model of Human Carcinoid
To prepare tumor cells for inoculation, cells in the
exponential growth phase were harvested by brief exposure to a 0.25% trypsin / 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (wt/vol). Cell viability was
determined by using Trypan blue exclusion, and only
single-cell suspensions that were more than 95%
viable were used. Tumor cells (1.5 3 106 cells/
mouse) were then injected into the subcutis of nude
mice in groups of 5. Tumor sizes (longest and shortest diameters of each tumor) were measures once a
week and tumor volume was calculated as described
previously.
Immunohistochemistry of Human Tumor Xenograft
Specimens
For VEGF staining, sections (5 lm thick) of formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded
alcohol. For CD31 staining, frozen sections (5 lm

Angiogenesis in Human Carcinoid/Zhang et al.

thick) were fixed with acetone. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide in
PBS for 12 minutes. The sections were incubated for
20 minutes at room temperature with a proteinblocking solution consisting of PBS (pH 7.5) containing 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat
serum and then incubated overnight at 48C in antiCD31or anti-VEGF antibodies. VEGF expression and
microvessel density (MVD) status were assessed as
described above.17,18

Statistical Analysis
Each experiment was performed independently at
least twice with similar results; 1 representative
experiment is presented. The significance of the in
vitro data was determined using a Student t-test (2tailed), whereas that of the in vivo data was determined using the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. v2
and the Fisher exact test were used to assess the
relation between VEGF expression and clinical-pathologic parameters. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) analyses were used to compare mean of
continuous variables. PFS duration was calculated
from the date of surgical resection using the KaplanMeier method. Two-sided P-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
VEGF Expression in and Its Relation With Angiogenic
Phenotype of Low-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
We performed immunostaining of VEGF and MVD
on primary tumors resected from 50 patients with
low-grade neuroendocrine tumor (Table 1). Classified
into 3 groups, strong, weak, and negative, VEGF
expression was observed in 16 (32%), 27 (54%), and 7
(14%) of cases, respectively. PFS duration was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
by VEGF expression. Strong VEGF expression was
associated with a poor prognosis. The median PFS
durations of patients with strong and weak VEGF
expression were 29 months and 81 months, respectively (P ¼ .02). The median PFS of patients with negative VEGF expression has not been reached. In this
group, at last follow-up 6 (86%) patients, with median
follow-up of 50 months, are alive and free from disease
progression (Fig. 1A). We then stratified the cases into
carcinoid and islet cell groups and compared the PFS
duration by VEGF expression. VEGF expression
remained a predictor of outcome (P ¼ .05). Moreover,
increased VEGF expression predicted an elevated
angiogenic phenotype (Fig. 1B), which was observed
in the majority of cases (Fig. 1C).

VEGF and Its Relation With Sp1 Expression
and Clinicopathologics
Among the 50 cases included in this study, 24 had
local-regional disease and 26 had metastasis. We
compared the group with negative VEGF expression
to the group with positive (weak or strong) VEGF
expression (Table 2). The presence of VEGF expression was associated with metastasis (14% versus
58%; P ¼ .03). We next examined the effect of VEGF
expression among carcinoid and islet cell subgroups.
Among 35 carcinoids, 71% of cases with positive
VEGF expression had metastasis; 25% of cases with
negative expression had metastasis. Similarly, among
15 islet cell cases 25% of cases with positive VEGF
expression had metastasis; none of the cases with
negative VEGF expression had metastasis. However,
due to the smaller number of cases in the subgroups,
these differences were not statistically significant.
Interestingly, a correlation between VEGF and
Sp1 expression was observed. Among cases with
strong (10 cases, 20%), weak (27 cases, 54%), and
negative (13, 25%) Sp1 expression, VEGF expression
(strong and weak) were observed in 13 of 13 (100%),
23 of 27 (85%), and 7 of 10 (70%) of cases, respectively (Table 3, P ¼ .03). When Sp1 expression was
analyzed relative to tumor size, larger tumor size correlated with strong expression (P ¼ .04). The mean

Bevacizumab Did Not Inhibit Human Carcinoid
Growth In Vitro
To determine whether VEGF is an autocrine growth
factor for human carcinoid cells, H727 and BON cells
were incubated for 48 hours in a medium or medium
containing 0.001 to 100 lg/mL bevacizumab. Viable
cells were determined by MTT assay. Also, total pro-

Next, culture supernatants were harvested from H727
cells, H727 cells treated with control IgG, H727 cells
treated with bevacizumab, or H727 cells treated with
bevacizumab and then addition of VEGF. The angiogenic potentials of the supernatants were determined
by an endothelial cell tube formation assay and endothelial cell proliferation assay. We found that neutralization of VEGF in the culture supernatants of
carcinoid cells almost totally blocked their ability to
stimulate endothelial cells tube formation and proliferation, i.e., suppression of angiogenic potential,
which was substantially reversed by addition of
recombinant VEGF (Fig. 3). These data suggested
that VEGF secreted from human carcinoid cells plays
a pivotal role in angiogenic phenotype.

Finally, we determined the effect of neutralizing carcinoid cells-derived VEGF on their angiogenesis and
growth in animal models. The H727 and BON cells
(1 3 106/mouse) were injected into the subcutis of
nude mice. Groups of mice (5 each) received either
an intraperitoneal injection (twice a week) of PBS or
bevacizumab when tumors reached 3 to 4 mm in diameter. Tumors sizes were monitored once every
week. We found that bevacizumab exhibited significant antitumor activity (Fig. 4A,B) consistent with
decreased MVD (Fig. 4C). However, an increased
VEGF expression was consistently found in all bevacizumab-treated tumors as determined by immunohistochemistry.

DISCUSSION
Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth beyond a
small size and is crucial in the process of metastasis.
In the present study we provide clinical, experimental,
and mechanistic evidence of VEGF overexpression

situ for tube formation in the supernatant of the above 4 groups. (B) The
degree of tube formation was assessed as the percentage of cell surface
area versus total surface area. Control cell cultures were given arbitrary percentage values of 100. (C) For endothelial cell proliferation assay, human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were plated in a 96-well plate and
treated as above. [3H]-TdR was added 24 hours after the cell plating and
the experiment was terminated 12 hours after the addition of [3H]-TdR. The

and its important role in human neuroendocrine
tumors. Specifically, we found that in human neuroendocrine tumors there is a strong correlation
between expression of transcriptional factor Sp1,
VEGF, and tumor size. In turn, VEGF expression was
also associated with metastasis. In experimental models we found VEGF neutralizing antibody bevacizumab
inhibited tumor growth in a human carcinoid xenograft model but not in tissue culture. This suggests the
activity of bevacizumab in this model is mediated predominantly through an antiangiogenic mechanism.

FIGURE 4. Bevacizumab inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) expression and microvessel density (MVD) and tumor growth in xenograft models. (A) The H727 and BON cells (1.5 3 106/mouse) were injected
into the subcutis of nude mice. Groups of mice (5 each) received either intraperitoneal injection (twice a week) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or
bevacizumab when tumors reached 3 to 4 mm in diameter. Tumors sizes
were monitored once every week. (B) Representative tumor-carrying mice
were presented. (C) Tissue sections were prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of both control and bevacizumab-treated tumors.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using specific antibodies
against VEGF and CD31. Of note is that bevacizumab treatment decreased
MVD but increased VEGF expression.

In a previous report, Couvelard et al21 had reported that higher microvascular density and VEGF
expression in islet cell tumors predicted a more favorable prognosis. However, it is important to note that
there are significant differences between that study
and our study. In our study only low-grade or welldifferentiated neuroendocrine tumors were included.
Thus, among patients with uniform histologic grade,
VEGF expression predicted a poor outcome. In the
previous study, the investigators included tumors
with varying histologic grade. They found that VEGF
expression and MVD were higher among benign islet
cell tumors and well-differentiated islet cell carcinoma compared with poorly differentiated cases.
However, similar to small cell carcinoma of the lung,
poorly differentiated or high-grade neuroendocrine
tumors are known to have different biology, pattern
of growth, and may be less dependent on VEGF for

growth and metastasis. Our findings are also supported by other investigators who have found plasma
VEGF levels to correlate with disease progression in
patients with neuroendocrine tumors.22
Our findings in human neuroendocrine tumors
are also supported by prior studies in xenograft.
Treating BON-1 implanted in nude mice with interferon, investigators found that the suppression of
VEGF gene transcription by interferon alpha was
mediated through an Sp1 and/or Sp3 dependent
mechanism.23 In a separate study, investigators implanted duodenal carcinoid in nude mice. Treatment
with neutralizing antibody to VEGF resulted in
decreased tumor size and inhibition of liver metastasis.24 These findings support our findings and suggest that Sp1 and VEGF may be crucial in human
neuroendocrine tumor progression. However, we
acknowledge that in vitro and in vivo experiments
may not necessarily be completely reflective of carcinoid biology in humans.
In the current study we also found that in
human carcinoid xenograft, whereas treatment with
bevacizumab inhibited tumor growth, it also led to
increased VEGF expression. Our finding is consistent
with the result observed in a Phase II study of the
VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in patients
with neuroendocrine tumors.25 In that study the
investigators found a greater than 3-fold in plasma
VEGF levels after 1 cycle of therapy. These data suggest up-regulation of VEGF transcription may be
potential mechanism of resistance among neuroendocrine tumor patients treated with VEGF inhibitors.
The notion that abnormal Sp1 and VEGF expression contributes to neuroendocrine tumor development and progression is well supported not only by
our study of pancreatic cancer18 and gastric cancer17
but also by other lines of evidence showing that Sp1
may regulate many aspects of cancer biology, including cell growth, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis.
Early studies indicated that Sp1 regulates multiple
growth-regulated genes, arguing that Sp1 may be important for cell-growth regulation. Direct evidence of
the ability of Sp1 to modulate transcription during
changes in cell growth came with the demonstration
that Sp1 is involved in the effects of serum stimulation
of quiescent cells at the rep3a promoter26 as well as at
the hamster dihydrofolate reductase27,28 and ornithine
decarboxylase promoters.29 More recently, several studies established the ability of Sp1 to mediate the
growth induction of a variety of promoters, including
those of the genes encoding FGFR1, EGFR, IGFR1,
HGFR,28,30–32 IGF-binding protein 2,33 VEGF,18,34 thymidine kinase,35 and serum response factor.36 Many
of these are also proangiogenic. Accumulating evi-

Angiogenesis in Human Carcinoid/Zhang et al.

dence has suggested that Sp1 family members are
involved in multiple aspects of angiogenesis.37
The exact mechanism for Sp1 overactivation in
neuroendocrine tumors is currently unknown. Altered oncogenes and suppressor genes may have a
particularly important role. Loss of the vHL gene has
been associated with the development of islet cell
carcinoma.4 Allelic deletion at chromosome 3p, the
site of the vHL gene, has also been described to
occur frequently in sporadic carcinoid and islet cell
tumors.8–10,38 Tumor cells harboring the inactivated
vHL gene are known to have increased VEGF expression and angiogenesis.39–41 Also, vHL-mediated repression of VEGF expression has convincingly been
shown to be mediated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.42,43 At the transcriptional level, vHL forms a complex with the Sp1
transcription factor and inhibits Sp1-mediated VEGF
expression.44 Whether oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes are involved in constitutive Sp1 activation in human cancer cells and how their status
affects that activation remains to be fully elucidated.
Whereas genomic deletions may confer a proliferative advantage for by inactivating tumor suppressor genes such as MEN1 and vHL, they may also
create weakness resulting in potential therapeutic
targets. For example, the VEGF-B gene activates the
same receptors as VEGF-A. Up-regulation of VEGF-B
expression represents a potential mechanism of resistance to agents targeting VEGF-A. However, VEGFB is located at 11q13 near the MEN1 gene, a site of
frequent allelic deletion in low-grade neuroendocrine
tumors.38,45,46 Indeed, VEGF-A itself is located on
6p12, a region where 1 copy is frequently deleted in
islet cell.38 NRP-2, a nontyrosine kinase receptor for
VEGF, appears to be expressed in normal neuroendocrine cells lining the digestive tract.47 Loss of expression has been reported in carcinoid tumors arising
from the appendix, colon, and rectum.47 Thus, deletions and loss of expression of genes in the VEGF
pathway may partially explain why neuroendocrine
tumors are among the few diseases where there is
single-agent activity for VEGF inhibitors.48,49
In summary, the VEGF pathway is crucial for
neuroendocrine tumor carcinogenesis and progression. VEGF expression may have prognostic value in
neuroendocrine patients undergoing resection. We
are currently investigating the molecular mechanism
by which the Sp1 signaling pathway regulates neuroendocrine tumor development and progression and
whether this Sp1 pathway is a potential therapeutic target for controlling cancer growth and metastasis.
Human trials targeting VEGF are under development in
clinics.
