Abstract
The androgen receptor cross-talks with transforming growth
factor-B (TGF-B) through mechanisms that remain poorly
understood. Here we provide strong evidence that 5Adihydrotestosterone (DHT) intercepts the ability of prostate
epithelial cells to undergo TGF-B–induced apoptosis, and
present a new model for this androgenic effect. We report that
DHT decreases the level of TGF-B receptor II (TBRII) through
a transcriptional mechanism, leading to suppression of the
ability of TGF-B to down-regulate expression of Bcl-xL and
cyclin Ds, activate caspase-3, and induce apoptosis. Promoter
analysis, DNA pulldown, and electrophoretic mobility shift
assays support that transcriptional down-regulation of TBRII
by DHT occurs through Sp1/Sp3 response elements, with the
binding of Sp1 to the TBRII promoter being suppressed by
DHT, largely driven by loss of Sp1 protein and/or activity.
These results provide fresh insight on the mechanism of growth
control by androgens and the progression of prostate cancer
to androgen independence. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):8173–82]

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h), which is a multifunctional cytokine with an important role as a potent tumor
suppressor in a variety of tissues including the prostate (1–7),
propagates signals through two transmembrane serine/threonine
receptor kinases, TGF-h receptor type I (ThRI) and type II (ThRII),
which directly activate Smad2 and Smad3 by phosphorylating
their two COOH-terminal serine residues (8–10). TGF-h is well
recognized to induce growth arrest or/and apoptosis of prostate
epithelium, occurring through mechanisms that seem to be intricately controlled by epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like
growth factor I, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and androgen
receptor (AR; refs. 11–13).
AR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of
transcription factors residing predominantly in the cytoplasm as
inactive complexes with molecular chaperones, particularly heat
shock proteins 70 and 90 (14, 15). Binding of androgen frees AR
from its chaperones, thereby promoting the translocation of AR to
the nucleus where this receptor functions in the transcriptional
control of numerous genes involved in development, growth, and
function of androgen target tissues such as the prostate. Although

transcriptional responses of AR occur mainly through the direct
binding of AR to DNA at AR response elements, the function of AR
is influenced by its association with numerous coregulators that
also serve as junctions of cross-talk with other signaling pathways
(16–19).
One of the important pathways AR cross-talks with is the TGF-h
pathway (11, 20–23). In rodents, androgen deprivation leads to
rapid elevation in levels of TGF-h, ThRI, and ThRII and activation
of Smad2 and Smad3, concomitant with the onset of apoptosis
(24–27). Further in vivo and in vitro studies support that androgens
promote cell survival, in part, through blocking TGF-h–induced
responses, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
investigated (11, 28–30).
AR has been shown to physically interact with Smad3 in the
absence of androgen or TGF-h stimulation (11, 21, 22). We
previously reported that the physical interaction of AR with Smad3
confers the ability of 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to suppress
TGF-h– or Smad3-induced transcription (11). In our model, AR
physically interacts with Smad3, and DHT then blocks the association of Smad3 to the Smad binding element (11). Those results
suggested that overactivation of AR during prostate tumor progression may lead to loss of TGF-h–induced responses, particularly the ability of TGF-h to function as a tumor suppressor.
However, several important issues remained unresolved, principally whether androgens could actually reverse TGF-h–promoted
growth arrest or/and apoptosis, the spectrum of TGF-h–regulated
genes affected by androgens, and the subset of those gene changes
involved in growth control or apoptosis. Here we showed that
androgen-bound AR significantly protects cells from TGF-h–
induced apoptosis, likely by reversing TGF-h–promoted downregulation of Bcl-xL and cyclin Ds and activation of caspase-3 in
human and rat prostate cell lines. We also provide evidence that
androgen broadly influences TGF-h responses by intercepting an
additional step in the TGF-h signaling pathway, i.e., by suppressing
ThRII expression through a transcriptional mechanism mediated
partly by down-regulation of Sp1 activity.

cancer cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS in
poly-D-lysine–coated 75-cm2 culture flask (11). Unless indicated, all
experiments in NRP-154 and NRP-152 cells were done in 1% DC-GM3
medium, and experiments involving DU145, LNCaP, C4-2B, and VCaP cells
were done in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% or 10% DC-stripped FBS
and 15 mmol/L HEPES. Experiments in LNCaP and C4-2B cells transiently
infected with Admax-ThRII were done in DMEM/F12 supplemented with
1% DC-stripped FBS, 15 mmol/L HEPES, and 20 ng/mL EGF.
Cell number and cell viability assays. CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell
proliferation assay kit (Promega) was used to assess cell viability. In brief,
NRP-154/AR4 cells were plated at a density of 5  103/100 AL/well in 96well plates with 1% DC-GM3 medium F2 Ag/mL doxycycline and FDHT.
Cells were incubated for overnight followed by treatment with TGF-h1 for
72 h. Cell viability was expressed as absorbance relative to that of untreated
control. For cell number assay, NRP-154 cells in 12-well plates (5  104/
1 mL/well) were infected with AdMax-AR (1:500) for 2 h and cultured
overnight in 1% DC-GM3 F DHT. TGF-h1 was added and cells were
incubated for an additional 48 h. Cell number was assayed using a Coulter
Electronics counter as before (34).
Crystal violet nuclei staining. Cells were fixed with 2% formalin/PBS
and incubated with 0.2 mg/mL of crystal violet solution for nuclei staining.
Cells were then washed twice with 1 PBS and dye was eluted by adding 1%
Triton X-100/PBS. The eluted dye was subjected to spectrophotometry at
550 nm.
Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis was done essentially as
described (35). In brief, 10 Ag of total RNA were electrophoresed, and equal
loading and even transfer were assessed by visualization of the 18S rRNA.
mRNA was detected with cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using PrimeIt RmT Random Primer labeling Kit (Stratagene).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Reverse transcription was done as
described (13). Taq Polymerase Master Mix (Promega) was used for PCR
amplification of rat ThRII, using 32 or 28 cycles, respectively, of the
following temperature gradients: 95jC for 15 s, 60jC for 30 s, and 72jC for
2 min. h-Actin, amplified as above for 21 cycles, served as an internal
control. Refer to Supplementary data for primer sequences.
Transient transfection and luciferase assay. Cells were transfected
using either the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (NRP-154) or
Invitrogen Lipofectamine plus reagent (LNCaP and DU145) as before (11).
Luciferase activity was measured using Promega Dual Luciferase Assay Kit
and a ML3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer. The Sp1 response element
reporter construct, Sp1-luc, was made by inserting four copies of a
consensus Sp1 response element upstream of the TATA transcription start
site (in HindIII and SalI of MCS) of the basic luciferase cloning vector,
pCIS-CK (Stratagene).
Adenoviruses. Adenovirus vectors that direct the expression of HAThRII (AdMax-HA-ThRII WT; ref. 12) were constructed using the AdMax
system (Microbix Biosystems) as described previously (12). For AdMax-AR,
the corresponding region to the coding sequence of AR was subcloned from
pCDNA3-AR (11) into the adenovirus shuttle vector, pDC515. HEK293 cells
in six-well plates were cotransfected with pDC515-AR (1 Ag) and 1 Ag of
the genomic vector, pBHGfrtDE1,3FLP, by calcium phosphate–mediated
transfection (11). Virus preparations were done as previously described (12).
DNA fragmentation assay. All of these procedures were done essentially
as described (36, 37). DNA was purified and internucleosomal DNA
fragmentation was detected using TACS apoptosis DNA ladder kit
(Trevigen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA pulldown assay. Biotin-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotides (WT and
mutant, 22-mer) were dimerized with its complements. For each reaction,
1.5 Ag of dimer were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 50 AL
of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Invitrogen) washed twice with 2 B&W
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mol/L NaCl]. After
conjugation in 1 B&W buffer, oligo-conjugated beads were washed thrice
with 1 B&W buffer to remove unconjugated oligonucleotides and resuspended with ice-cold DNAP buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mmol/L
KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40, 1 mmol/L EDTA] with
1 mmol/L DTT added freshly. Nuclear protein (100 Ag) was incubated

Results
Androgen protects NRP-154 cells from TGF-B–induced
apoptosis. We previously reported that androgens can intercept
TGF-h–induced changes in gene expression through a physical
interaction of AR with Smad3 in LNCaP and NRP-154 cells
transfected with ThRII and AR, respectively. Our electrophoretic
mobility shift assay results indicated that AR blocked Smad3
binding to Smad3-binding element (11). However, the effect of
androgens on growth suppression and apoptosis was undefined
due to lack of a suitable prostate carcinoma cell line that expressed
AR and responded to TGF-h by growth suppression and/or
apoptosis. To resolve this barrier, we generated an adenoviral
system (AdMax-AR) to efficiently express AR (>90% infection) in
the NRP-154 cell line, which is exquisitely sensitive to TGF-h–
induced apoptosis (37). The AR- or control virus (AdMax-cont)–
infected cells were treated with DHT (1 or 10 nmol/L) 24 hours
before the addition of TGF-h, and changes in apoptosis and cell
morphology were observed 48 hours later (Fig. 1A). Forty-eight
hours of TGF-h1 treatment killed essentially all cells infected with
the control or AR virus, whereas treatment with 1 or 10 nmol/L
DHT significantly protected AR-expressing cells against killing by
TGF-h1 (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S1A, and data not shown).
Such changes were also reflected at the level of total internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1B), a hallmark of apoptosis.
We confirmed that ligand-bound AR can also protect against TGF-h–
induced death in a doxycycline-inducible, AR-expressing NRP-154
clonal cell line (NRP-154/AR4; Fig. 1C, left) and in nontumorigenic
NRP-152 cells infected with AdMax-AR (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To examine the duration of such protection, we next assessed
changes in total viable cells after allowing the TGF-h F DHT
treated cultures (5 days) to recover in their normal growth medium
without exogenous TGF-h or DHT for 4 to 10 days. Our data
supported that as little as 0.1 nmol/L DHT enormously protected
the cells from TGF-h1–induced apoptosis, as no cells survived the
effects of TGF-h unless protected by DHT, giving rise to >104-fold
increases in total cell number with DHT versus without DHT
[Fig. 1C (right) and D]. Taken together, these data support that
AR signaling very effectively suppresses TGF-h–induced apoptosis
in prostate epithelial cells.
DHT suppresses the ability of TGF-B1 to induce the
expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, activate
caspase-3, and suppress the expression of Bcl-xL and cyclin
Ds. The above results suggest that androgen-bound AR may
interrupt the ability of TGF-h to control the expression of or
activate proteins involved in apoptosis or cell cycle control. We
previously reported that ligand-bound AR inhibits TGF-h induced
transcriptional responses, using various response element luciferase reporter constructs and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) promoter construct, 3TP-lux (11). To confirm those results

Figure 1. Androgen protects cells from TGF-h–induced cell death in the NRP-154 cell line. A, NRP-154 cells were transiently infected with either AdMax-cont
or AdMax-AR (1:500) and cultured FDHT (1 or 10 nmol/L) for 24 h before 48 h of TGF-h1 (10 ng/mL) treatment. B, the internucleosomal fragmentation was measured
following treatment with FTGF-h1, FDHT, and FAdMax-AR in NRP-154. C, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in NRP-154/AR4 cells
stably expressing AR and treated as in B (left). DHT was added to NRP-154 cells transiently overexpressing AR for 24 h before TGF-h1 treatment. Five days
later, the live cells were cultured in GM2.1 medium for additional 10 d and cell number was assayed using a Coulter Electronics counter (right ). D, NRP-154 cells
transiently overexpressing AR were cultured in FDHT for 24 h before treatment with TGF-h1. After 5 d of TGF-h1 treatment, medium was replaced with GM2.1
and cells were cultured for 4 d before crystal violet staining to evaluate cell viability. Cell viability was quantified by spectrophotometry at 550 nm, measuring
the dye eluted from cells. Columns, average of triplicate independent experiments; bar, SD. Representative of two to three independent experiments.

at the level of endogenous PAI-l, effects of DHT on TGF-h–induced
expression of PAI-1 mRNA and protein were examined in NRP154 + AR and in LNCaP + ThRII. TGF-h1 strongly induced PAI-1
mRNA and protein levels, occurring in a manner that was abolished by pretreatment with DHT (Fig. 2A). A bone metastastic
derivative of LNCaP, C4-2B, which are androgen refractory likely
through having constitutively active AR (38), failed to induce
PAI-1 protein expression in response to TGF-h1 despite enforced
expression of ThRII (Fig. 2A).
We showed that TGF-h1 induces apoptosis, activates caspase-3,
down-regulates the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-xL (39), induces cell
cycle arrest at G1 and G2-M, and down-regulates cyclin D2 in NRP154 and NRP-152 (derived from preneoplastic rat prostate). To
understand how androgen prevents TGF-h–induced growth
suppression and apoptosis, we examined whether DHT could
affect the ability of TGF-h to control the expression of
antiapoptotic or proapoptotic factors and cyclin Ds. Either 1 or
10 nmol/L DHT significantly blocked TGF-h–induced activation
of caspase-3 (Fig. 2B), whereas 10 nmol/L DHT was necessary

to reverse the TGF-h1–induced loss of Bcl-xL in NRP-154 F AR
(Fig. 2B), suggesting that the reversal of caspase-3 activation was
independent of that of Bcl-xL. We next tested the possibility that
androgen treatment can reverse the ability of TGF-h1 to reduce
cyclin D expression. In the case of NRP-154 + AR cells, TGF-h1
treatment down-regulated cyclin D3 levels at 24 hours, and D1
and D3 by 48 hours. Such down-regulation of cyclin D3 was
reversed by DHT (Fig. 2C). Similar experiments were done in
LNCaP and C4-2B cells infected with AdMax-ThRII. DHT slightly
increased the expression of all three cyclin Ds in LNCaP cells. In
contrast, C4-2B cells expressed high basal levels of all three cyclin
Ds, consistent with the expression of constitutively active AR in
those cells, and showed no induction by DHT (Fig. 2D). As
expected, DHT completely reversed the TGF-h1–mediated downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 at both 24 hours
(Fig. 2D) and 48 hours (data not shown) in LNCaP cells. However,
C4-2B cells having constitutively active AR were refractory to the
down-regulation of cyclin Ds by TGF-h1 (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
the above data suggest that distinct mechanisms control the

ability of TGF-h to down-regulate each of the D cyclins and that
such differential regulation is cell type specific.
DHT down-regulates the expression of TBRII, but not TBRI.
We previously reported that androgens disrupt the binding of
Smad3 to Smad3-binding element through a direct association of
AR with Smad3 (11). However, further investigation in our group
suggested that additional mechanisms may be involved in the
disruption of TGF-h responses by androgens. Our study suggested
that TGF-h1–activated Smad3 was markedly repressed by

androgen.5 Thus, to better understand the mechanism by which
AR suppresses TGF-h1 responses, we examined whether DHT may
also alter the levels of TGF-h receptors. NRP-154 + AR cells were
preincubated with DHT for 48 hours before TGF-h1 treatment,
and protein levels of ThRI/II were determined. DHT substantially

down-regulated the levels of ThRII, but not ThRI, irrespective of
TGF-h1 treatment (Fig. 3A). We further performed time course
experiments of DHT on ThRII expression. ThRII protein levels
were substantially down-regulated as early as 3 hours of DHT
addition and persisted at the same level up to 48 hours, whereas
no change in ThRI protein levels was observed at any of the time
points tested (Fig. 3B). Similar to NRP-154, in DU145, ligandstimulated AR abolished ThRII protein expression, and neither
DHT nor AR alone inhibited ThRII expression (Fig. 3C). We were
not able to assess the effect of DHT on the regulation of ThRII in
LNCaP and C4-2B because their level of endogenous ThRII was
undetectable. We therefore used another AR-positive prostate
cancer cell line, VCaP, to assess the role of endogenous AR on
endogenous ThRII levels. Consistently, 48-hour treatment with
DHT repressed the level of ThRII in VCaP (Fig. 3D). Taken
together, our data suggest that androgen suppresses TGF-h
signaling partly by decreasing ThRII.
Transcriptional repression of TBRII by DHT. The relatively
rapid (3 hours) down-regulation of ThRII protein by DHT (Fig. 3B)
suggested a transcriptional mechanism. We therefore examined
whether DHT also suppressed the levels of ThRII mRNA.
Consistent with the above results, a time course experiment
revealed that DHT significantly decreased the mRNA levels of
ThRII, with noticeable changes occurring between 4 and 12 hours
of treatment (Fig. 4A, left). DU145 + AR also showed robust loss of
ThRII expression following 24 hours of DHT treatment (Fig. 4A,
right). Together, these data suggest that DHT controls ThRII
protein levels through mRNA stability or transcriptional control
rather than protein stability or translational control.
To determine if DHT can inhibit expression of ThRII through a
transcriptional mechanism, we cotransfected various prostate cell

lines with FpCDNA3-AR, ThRII promoter constructs (pThRII-luc)
along with cytomegalovirus (CMV)-renilla, followed by 24 hours
F10 nmol/L DHT, and monitored changes in relative luciferase
activity (Fig. 4B). The pThRII( 216/+35)-luc construct, which has
two positive response elements (PRE1 and PRE2), shows optimal
promoter activity (40). DHT significantly inhibited this promoter
activity by f85% in NRP-154 + AR and by >90% in DU145 + AR
cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with protein and mRNA levels. The
full-length ThRII promoter construct, pThRII( 1670/+38)-luc,
although less active, was almost completely (>90%) suppressed by
DHT under the same conditions in DU145 + AR cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Because LNCaP cells express low to undetectable
levels of ThRII and have very low pThRII-luc activity, we used the
histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 to enhance this promoter
activity, as before (13). DHT (24 hours) effectively suppressed the
expression of this promoter in LNCaP treated with 1 Amol/L
MS-275. About 50% inhibition of this promoter activity was
observed by DHT in VCaP (Fig. 4B).
To identify the specific promoter region responsible for
suppression by DHT, cells were transiently transfected with various
5¶-end truncations of ThRII promoter-luciferase constructs (ref. 41;
Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, the effect of inhibition by androgen was
observed in all the truncated ThRII-promoter constructs despite
differences in the magnitude of repression between cell lines
(Fig. 4C). This unexpected observation led us to examine the
involvement of transcription factors essential for transcription or
initiation of transcription by TATA-less promoters. In the case of
ThRII promoter, Sp1 has been shown to be critical in transcriptional initiation of ThRII, as it is TATA-less. All deletion constructs
of this promoter tested (Fig. 4C) contain either one or two Sp1 sites
at 143 and 25. We introduced mutations between 63 and +2 at

sites corresponding to putative transcription factor binding
elements including Sp1 site at 25 (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and
tested whether any of those mutants would ablate suppression by
DHT. As expected, mutation of the 25 Sp1 site abolished
promoter activity in both DU145 and NRP-154 cells, suggesting

this Sp1 site functions as a transcriptional start site. Other
mutations substantially lowered the basal activity of this promoter
but failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of DHT (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Taken together, these data strongly implicate Sp1 as a
target of androgen-mediated suppression of the ThRII promoter.

DHT inhibits Sp1 expression. To study the potential role of
Sp1 in mediating the suppression of the ThRII promoter by DHT,
we measured the protein levels of Sp1 in NRP-154 + AR cells
following treatment with DHT for various times. DHT significantly
lowered the level of Sp1 by 6 hours of treatment and continued
through 48 hours (Fig. 5A), correlating with levels of ThRII (Fig. 3).
Sp1 levels were similarly decreased by DHT in DU145 + AR cells
(Fig. 5A).
Although Sp3 is known to function mainly as a transcriptional
suppressor, it may also function as a transcriptional activator. Sp3
binds to the same Sp1 response elements but may either activate or
repress transcription, depending on the context of other response
elements or transcription regulators. Therefore, we also examined
changes in Sp3 expression on the same blots. In contrast to Sp1,
DHT did not affect Sp3 expression in NRP-154 + AR; however, DHT
down-regulated Sp3, especially the 60-kDa Sp3 isoform in DU145 +
AR (Fig. 5A). Collectively, these data suggest that the transcriptional suppression of ThRII by androgen may occur through downregulation of Sp1/Sp3.
Sp1 is activated by posttranslational modifications that promote
its rapid nuclear translocation. We further studied whether the loss
of Sp1 protein by androgen in whole cell lysates reflects its level in
the nuclear compartment and influences the activity of Sp1. As in
Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S3A, no Sp1 was detected in the
cytosolic fraction and a markedly low level of Sp1 was measured in
the nuclear fraction of DHT-treated cells, showing similar Sp1
levels in parallel whole cell lysates. We next tested the effect of DHT
on the transcriptional activity of Sp1 alone by using an Sp1 reporter
construct (Sp1-luc), composed of four tandem consensus Sp1
binding elements inserted upstream of the TATA transcription
start site of the promoter-less luciferase reporter pCIS-CK. As
expected, DHT strikingly inhibited the activity of Sp1-luc (>90%)
in DU145, supporting the loss of Sp1 activity caused by DHT
(Fig. 5B), reflecting the loss of Sp1 levels in the nucleus (Fig. 5A).
Similar results were obtained with NRP-154 + AR and VCaP cells
(Fig. 5B). Loss of Sp1 activity was next tested by measuring the
physical association of endogenous Sp1 from NRP-154-AR cells to
biotinylated WT or mutant Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides that
were pulled down by strepavidin-agarose resin (Fig. 5C). Our results
showed that Sp1 constitutively binds consensus WT but not
mutant Sp1 oligos, and that DHT abolished binding of Sp1 to Sp1
oligo only in cells expressing AR (Fig. 5C). We also performed
electrophoretic mobility shift assay using Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides (WT and mutant) and Sp1 binding site in the ThRII
promoter region 25 (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C). Androgenstimulated AR significantly diminished DNA binding to WT but not
mutant Sp1 oligonucleotide (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Furthermore, when a 32-mer oligonucleotide designed from ThRII ( 25p)
was subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DHT clearly
suppressed DNA binding of Sp1 (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
To confirm in our model that loss of Sp1 activity by DHT plays
a role in the ability of DHT to suppress Sp1-dependent promoter
activity, we attempted to reverse the DHT-dependent loss of Sp1
activity by overexpressing WT-Sp1 in NRP-154-AR cells. As shown
in Fig. 5C, the DNA binding activity of Sp1, which was inhibited by
ligand-activated AR, was completely restored by exogenously
expressed WT-Sp1. Moreover, expression of exogenous Sp1 partially
reversed the ability of DHT to diminish ThRII promoter activity in
NRP-154 + AR (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S3D). Taken together,
the above results strongly support that DHT blocks the transcription of ThRII, at least partly, through down-regulation of Sp1

protein expression and inhibition of total DNA binding resulting
from its reduced expression (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Here we provide the first evidence supporting that DHT,
functioning through AR, suppresses the TGF-h signaling pathway
controlling apoptosis and growth arrest. Moreover, we show that
DHT stimulation interrupts TGF-h signaling by shutting down the
production of newly made ThRII through a transcriptional
mechanism. This mechanism is likely to function cooperatively
with another mechanism we previously described (11), involving
the direct binding of active Smad3 to AR, which blocks the
interaction of Smad3 with Smad3-binding element on target genes.
Here we report the first observation that DHT down-regulates the
expression and activity of Sp1/Sp3, and provide evidence that DHTinduced transcriptional repression of ThRII is, at least in part,
mediated by down-regulation of Sp1 levels, leading to reduced
association of nuclear Sp1 to Sp1 response elements in the ThRII
promoter. Previous studies have clearly established the importance
of Sp1 and Sp3 in transcriptional controls of ThRII (42). Further
efforts in our laboratory are under way to understand the
underlying implications of the DHT-mediated loss of Sp1 activity
in the regulation of other androgenic responses and to delineate
the mechanism by which androgens down-regulate Sp1 protein
levels or its biological activity. These issues are likely to be of
fundamental importance in the regulation of androgenic responses,
considering the broad range of TATA-less genes that may be
influenced by such changes in Sp1 activity. Preliminary reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) data from NRP-154-AR cells showed
that levels of Sp1 mRNA were not significantly altered by DHT
(Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that down-regulation of Sp1 by
DHT occurs at the level of protein stability or translational control,
rather than mRNA stability or transcriptional control. Although
our data support a role for Sp1 as a mediator of transcriptional
control of ThRII by DHT, we believe that other transcriptional
factors such as CBF-A and YY-1, which are slightly suppressed by
ligand-bound AR (preliminary study and data not shown), may also
play a role in such regulation. Therefore, we speculate that
androgen regulation of ThRII is more complex, involving multiple
transcriptional factors.
Our data here are consistent with in vivo studies on the rat
prostate where androgen ablation induced by castration was
shown to activate the TGF-h signaling not only by inducing the
expression of TGF-hs but also by elevating the levels of ThRII and
Smad3 activation (24, 26, 27). We thus suggest that androgens may
protect against apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells through
multiple mechanisms, involving loss of TGF-h1 and ThRII and
the direct association of Smad3 with AR. The latter mechanism is
more likely to account for suppression of TGF-h responses in
LNCaP-ThRII, where ThRII expression is under the control of CMV
promoter (not controlled by androgen).
It is well known that prostate cancers ultimately fail antiandrogen therapy as they progress toward the state of androgen
independence. Although the mechanisms behind this are yet to be
resolved, growing evidence supports that the AR signaling pathway is constitutively activated rather than suppressed, most likely
through AR mimicking the conformation of ligand-activated AR but
without androgen (18). AR silencing studies show that androgenindependent prostate cancer cells require AR for survival, parallel
to the requirement of androgen in androgen-dependent epithelial

cells (43). Regardless of the mechanisms involved, our study
suggests that constitutive activation of the AR pathway may
suppress TGF-h signaling through down-regulation of ThRII
expression. Consistent with our observation is the C4-2B cell line
bearing constitutively active AR; these cells are resistant to TGF-h
even when ThRII is overexpressed. In fact, even exogenous ThRII
was difficult to detect in C4-2 cells. Moreover, EGF, which enhances
expression of ThRII in LNCaP cells (13), failed to elevate ThRII
levels in C4-2B cells or sensitize them to TGF-h. Our preliminary
data showed no differences between LNCaP and C4-2B cells in the
efficiency of transfection or infection. This result therefore indicates
that constitutively activated AR in C4-2B cells may promote loss of
exogenous ThRII, suggesting that an additional mechanism may be
operating in androgen refractory prostate cancer that leads to loss
of ThRII. Such a mechanism may contribute to the overall loss of
ThRII expression found in human prostate cancer and correlate
with poor clinical outcome. Based on these observations and ideas,
we propose that constitutive activation of AR during prostate
cancer progression may cause loss of the tumor suppressor function
of TGF-h in prostate carcinoma cells, thus aiding in tumor
progression.
A recent report shows that loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN,
occurring at high incidence in late-stage prostate cancers and
leading to constitutive activation of Akt and mammalian target of
rapamycin, promotes androgen independence (44). We previously

showed that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian
target of rapamycin pathway can suppress TGF-h signaling
through suppression of the activation of Smad3 (33). Thus, loss
of PTEN may promote androgen independence, at least partly, by
suppressing TGF-h signaling through an AR-independent mechanism or/and through a mechanism involving the activation of AR
by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of
rapamycin pathway. Regardless of the specific mechanisms
involved, loss of growth suppression or apoptosis by TGF-h is
likely to enhance tumor growth. Thus, restoring TGF-h responses
in androgen-independent epithelial cells, perhaps by intercepting
the ability of AR to disrupt TGF-h signaling, is likely to have
important therapeutic implications.
