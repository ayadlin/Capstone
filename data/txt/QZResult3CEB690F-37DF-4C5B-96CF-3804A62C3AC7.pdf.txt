Abstract
Author Manuscript

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters translocate substrates across cell membranes, using
energy harnessed from ATP binding and hydrolysis at their nucleotide binding domains
(NBDs)1,2. ABC exporters are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes with examples
implicated in multidrug resistance of pathogens and cancer cells, as well as in many human
diseases3,4. TmrAB is a heterodimeric ABC exporter from the thermophilic Gram-negative
eubacterium Thermus thermophilus homologous to various multidrug transporters and containing
one degenerate site with a non-catalytic residue next to the Walker B motif5. Here we report a
subnanometer resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inwardfacing conformation by single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). The reconstructions
clearly resolved characteristic features of ABC transporters, including helices in the
transmembrane domain (TMD) and NBDs. A cavity in the TMD is accessible laterally from the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the transporter

lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two NBDs remain in contact via their C-terminal
helices. Furthermore, comparison between our structure and the crystal structures of other ABC
transporters suggests a possible trajectory of conformational changes that involves a sliding and
rotating motion between the two NBDs during the transition from the inward facing to outward
facing conformations.

ABC transporters use ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive substrate translocation across a
membrane. Many members of the ABC exporter family have varying selectivity and
transport substrates from inside to outside of the cell, a property thought to allow them to
facilitate export of xenobiotics such as drugs and toxins6,7. TmrAB has similar features to
multidrug transporters, including transport of Hoechst 33342 dye and competitive inhibition
by verapamil, which suggests a common mechanism for transport5. It is composed of two
homologous subunits, TmrA and TmrB, arranged with pseudo 2-fold symmetry with a
combined molecular weight of ∼135kDa. Each subunit has a 6-helix TMD and a
cytoplasmic NBD. TmrAB has two ATP binding sites, each formed between both NBDs.
However, only one site is an active ATPase consensus site capable of ATP hydrolysis. The
degenerate (“inactive”) site has a non-canonical aspartate residue next to the Walker B motif
contributed by one NBD and non-canonical residues from the ABC signature motif of the
other NBD5.

Despite several crystal structures of ABC exporters representing various states along the
transport cycle, there are competing models of how these states are functionally connected
in a physiological setting8-10. Single particle cryo-EM holds the promise to offer structural
information complimentary to x-ray crystallography, especially regarding conformational
states that may be difficult to access within the confines of a crystal lattice. However,
structure determination by single particle cryo-EM is favored by a relatively large molecular
mass and higher symmetry. While recent technological breakthroughs enabled determination
of the first atomic structures of homo-tetrameric ion channels of ∼300kDa11, determining a
high-resolution structure of TmrAB still represents a major challenge, owing to its smaller
size and pseudo-symmetric organization12.

Here, we used Fragment antigen binding (Fab) domains to overcome these challenges. A
Fab that forms a stable complex with TmrAB has a number of advantages for structure
determination by single particle cryo-EM13. Furthermore, conformational specific synthetic
Fabs stabilize particles in a specific functional state14. Following our established procedure
for Fab selection15, five Fabs were identified from a human naïve B cell Fab phagedisplayed library using β-DDM (n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside)-solubilized TmrAB as the
antigen. Fab binding was validated using a qualitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) screen15 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). The Fabs were further characterized
by competitive ELISA analysis to establish whether these Fabs have overlapping or
independent epitopes (see Online Methods and Fig. 1b). AD12, BA6, and AH11 (“class A”)
were found to have overlapping epitopes, inhibiting the binding of one another, whereas
AH5 (“class B”) and DH5 (“class C”) were found to have unique epitopes. Rigidity of the
complexes was assessed by negative stain EM two-dimensional (2D) class averages. All
TmrAB-Fab complexes yielded 2D class averages that show characteristic features of Fabs

(Fig 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d), suggesting that these Fabs form sufficiently rigid
complexes with TmrAB. TmrAB complexes that clearly show two Fabs (Fig 1c) confirm
that those Fabs bind to distinct sites. Furthermore, ELISA and negative stain EM
demonstrated that AH5 and BA6 display the highest relative affinities (Extended Data Fig.
1b-d). Thus, these Fabs are preferred candidates for structure determination of TmrAB by
cryo-EM. To gain more insight into the Fab-binding properties, AH5 and class A Fabs were
used in an immunoblotting assay with denatured TmrAB. AH5, despite showing the highest
affinity (Extended Data Fig. 1d), did not bind the denatured transporter, whereas all three
class A Fabs, including BA6, bound to denatured TmrB (Fig 1d). These data suggested that
AH5 recognizes a 3D epitope and that BA6 recognizes a linear epitope(s) within the TmrB
sequence.

Detergent solubilized TmrAB-AH5 complex was purified (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Frozenhydrated TmrAB-AH5 particles were imaged using a direct electron detection camera, K2
Summit, following newly implemented procedures16. 2D class averages of the TmrAB-AH5
complex show landmark features of both TmrAB and Fab (Extended Data Fig. 2b-e). We
determined a 3D reconstruction of TmrAB-AH5 to a resolution of 8.2Å using gold standard
Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criteria (Extended Data Fig. 2f-g)17. Local
resolution estimation18 suggests most regions of the density map have a ∼6Å resolution
(Extended Data Figure 2h-i). The density map is of sufficient quality to clearly resolve
secondary structure features, including all helices in the TMDs and NBDs (Fig. 2 and
Extended Data Fig.3). Such well-defined structural features suggest that TmrAB as
visualized here adapts a defined conformation of an ABC exporter with well-ordered
domain architecture. Furthermore, density corresponding to the detergent micelle defines a
distorted ellipsoidal structure around the TMDs. The characteristic dumbbell-shaped Fab
density is also clearly defined, validating the correctness of the 3D reconstruction.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that the conformation of TmrAB is not influenced by AH5 binding, we
determined two other 3D reconstructions -TmrAB alone and in complex with BA6. The 3D
reconstruction of the TmrAB-BA6 complex was determined to a resolution of 9.4 Å
(Extended Data Fig. 4) using a phosphor scintillator-based CMOS camera. At this
resolution, the majority of the TmrAB helices are resolved, and the BA6 Fab density has the
expected shape. The3D reconstruction of TmrAB alone was determined using the same
CMOS camera to 10Å resolution (Extended Data Fig. 5). The densities of TmrAB in all
reconstructions overlay with each other in a unique orientation as measured by local cross
correlation (Extended Data Fig. 6), confirming that TmrAB is in a native conformation that
is not induced by Fab binding. These experiments also demonstrated that both Fab
incorporation and utilization of the direct electron detection camera improved accuracies of
image alignment and subsequent resolution of the final reconstruction (Extended Data Table
1).
A model of TmrAB was constructed based on homology modeling and molecular dynamics
flexible fitting. The crystal structure of a heterodimeric ABC exporter from a thermophilic
bacterium Thermotoga maritima, TM287/2888, was used as starting template. TM287 shares
31.3% sequence identity with TmrB, whereas TM288 shares 37.8% sequence identity with
the TmrA. Following consideration of 2D class averages (Fig. 1c), immunoblotting data

(Fig. 1d) and 3D reconstruction of TrmAB-BA6 (Extended Data Fig. 4), we concluded that
BA6 binds to the tip of TmrB's NBD, opposite the AH5 binding site. This allowed us to
position unambiguously the homology model into the density map as well as determine the
handedness of the 3D reconstruction. The model was fit into the TmrAB-AH5 density map
by molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF)19, yielding the final model of TmrAB
(Extended Data Fig. 7). In both the 3D density map and the fitted model, a cavity is evident
that is accessible to the cytoplasm, suggesting that TmrAB is in an inward-facing
conformation (Fig. 3a). The model also confirms that AH5 and BA6 interact with the NBD
of TmrA and TmrB respectively. Such Fab binding inhibits ATPases activity of TmrAB
(Extended Data Fig. 8), thus locking TmrAB in the current conformation.

In the 3D reconstructions, the detergent micelle forms a torus in which two helices lie in the
surface resulting in an unusual bi-lobed micelle with two halves tilted from each other by
about 30° (Fig. 2a). This separation is mediated in both monomers by TM4, which curves
outward with TM5 and protrudes closer to the head groups of α-DDM (Fig. 2c). The TMDs
contain two subdivisions, each of which is composed of TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM6 of one
monomer and TM4 and TM5 of the other monomer. The splitting of the micelle matches the
subdivisions of the TMDs in this conformation.

Author Manuscript

A large cavity is located on one side of the TMDs, surrounded by TM1-3 and TM6 of TmrA
and TM4-6 of TmrB (Fig. 3a). Significant density (visualized at 5σ) was observed in the
cavity bound to TM5 of TmrB (Fig. 3b, Extended Fig. 3a), analogous to the substrate
binding sites identified for glutathione ATM1-type transporters20,21. This density has
sufficient size to accommodate molecules as large as a Hoechst 33342 molecule, a known
substrate for TmrAB5. While the identity of the molecule that contributed to this density is
unknown, we speculate that it is attributable to an unknown molecule co-purified with
TmrAB, molecules of DDM detergent, or lipids, suggesting that the cavity contains the
cytoplasmic substrate-binding site. Although the cavity is open to the cytosol, it also has a
small, lateral V-shaped gap (formed by TM4 and TM6 of TmrB) that provides an additional
entry point from the inner leaflet of the surrounding membrane. However, this gap is
considerably smaller than the opening found in a wide-open, V-shaped apo conformation,
such as in the open apo state of MsbA22.

The structure of TmrAB reported here is in an inward-facing state in which two NBDs are in
contact with each other via their C-terminal helices. This conformation is similar to the
substrate-bound nucleotide-free state of ATM1-type exporters20,21 or a eukaryotic Pglycoprotein homolog23. We confirmed that the isolated TmrAB truly is nucleotide free
(Extended Data Fig. 8). Therefore, in the nucleotide-free TmrAB structure, two NBDs
remain in contact with each other via the C-terminal helices of both NBDs (Fig. 2d), burying
a total surface area of ∼980Å (see Online Methods) with a minimal distance between the Cα
positions of the two C-terminal helices of ∼5Å. Disulfide bond cross-linking of nucleotidefree TmrAB with two independent cysteine mutation pairs in their C-terminal helices
(TmrA-L585C/TmrB-G564C, or TmrA-A591C/TmrB-A567C) validated this interaction
(Fig. 3c-d and Extended Data Figure 9). Consequentially, the two subdivisions of the TMDs
are not widely separated. Indeed, no TmrAB particles were observed in a wide-open, V-

shaped conformation as found in some crystal structures of nucleotide-free ABC exporters
where the two NBDs are separated by a distance of 20 - 40Å9,22,24,25.

Connecting conformational states of a given ABC transporter to its substrate transport cycle
requires structures at all distinct functional states, which are currently not available for most
transporters. Therefore we were limited to compare the structures from different members of
the family. The well-resolved helices and distinct features of our reconstruction ensure that
the structure of TmrAB reported here is of sufficient precision to compare on a secondary
structural level with structures of other ABC exporters, the AMPPNP-bound intermediate
inward facing structure of TM287/2888 and the ADP bound outward facing structure of
homodimeric Sav186626, determined by crystallography. Such comparison suggests a
trajectory of conformational changes connecting these states (Supplementary Movie 1 and
2). In TmrAB, the Walker A motifs in the two NBDs face each other but do not face the
ABC signature motifs of the opposite NBDs (Fig. 4a top). In AMPPNP-TM287/288 the
NBDs are in a different dimer contact state with the Walker A and ABC signature motifs of
the opposite NBDs facing each other (Fig. 4a middle). In the outward-facing Sav1866
structure, the NBDs are in a further closed dimer state (Fig. 4a bottom) to sandwich two
nucleotides between the NBDs as if in a hydrolytically competent-like state. This suggests
that the NBDs may slide and rotate against each other as they bind, then sandwich ATP
molecules between the domains during the transition from the inward to outward facing
conformation in a mechanism similar to that of the ABC importers27.

Author Manuscript

The relative NBD positions are associated with reorganizations of the TMDs, especially
TM4 and TM6. In TmrAB, TM4 and TM6 of chain B show the furthest separation of ∼18Å
(Fig. 4b top), which corresponds to the lateral cavity opening shown in the open volume
calculation of Fig. 3 as well as the substrate position. The lateral cavity opening is present in
the intermediate state structure of TM287/288 but has narrowed to a maximal separation of
10Å (Fig. 4b middle) between the hinges of TM4 and TM6. In the outward-open
conformation of Sav1866, the cavity is completely occupied by TM4 and TM6, leaving an
opening exposed to the extracellular surface (Fig. 4b bottom). The rearrangements in the
transmembrane domain, specifically TM4 and TM6, work in concert to close the lateral
membrane gate and open a perpendicular extracellular gate. These movements are coupled
to sliding and rotation of the NBDs from an orientation with Walker A motifs in contact
with each other to an orientation wherein the Walker A motifs contact the opposing ABC
motif (Supplementary Movie 3 and 4).

Here, we used single particle cryo-EM to determine a subnanometer resolution structure of
detergent-solubilized TmrAB in the nucleotide-free state without influence from crystal
packing. The resulting structure revealed an asymmetric inward-facing state with NBDs in
contact but not in a position for ATP hydrolysis. Compared to another membrane protein
recently determined to 3.4Å resolution (TRPV1, ∼300kDa and C4 symmetry)11, TmrAB is
a more challenging target because of its smaller size (∼135kDa) and its pseudosymmetry.
The structure reported here greatly extends the capability of single particle cryo-EM. At this
resolution all helices in TMD and NBDs are unambiguously resolved, affording the
determination of a reliable model based on the well-established workflow of homology
modeling and flexible docking19. It was made possible by taking advantage of three novel

technologies: (i) Fab assisted single-particle cryo-EM13, (ii) newly developed cryo-EM
methodologies including a direct electron detection camera, and (iii) maximum likelihood
based classification and refinement28. Each of these technological advancements improves
accuracy of image alignments and the resolutions of the final reconstructions (Extended
Data Table 1). In theory, it is possible to achieve ∼3Å resolution structure of proteins as
small as ∼100kDa12. In practice, there are still major technological limitations that prevent
achieving this goal, even with recent technological advances. Nevertheless, we expect that
the combined approaches used in this study will be a powerful strategy for capturing the
molecular features of membrane proteins in discrete functional states difficult to capture by
crystallization. These structural snapshots will aid in the elucidation of membrane protein
mechanisms while advancing the limits in structural determination by single particle cryoEM.

While this manuscript is under review, Hohl et al. reported a nucleotide free structure of
TM287/28829, which is almost identical with the singly AMPPNP bound structure (r.m.s.d.
of 0.636Å). It supports our conclusion that NBDs remain in contact in the nucleotide free
state, but cross-linking behavior (Fig. 3c) suggests a noticeable conformational change in
TmrAB upon AMPPNP binding. Fully addressing such difference requires structures of the
same protein at all functional states, which single particle cryo-EM holds promise to deliver.

Online Methods
Sample preparation

Author Manuscript

TmrAB was expressed and purified similarly as described previously5. Protein was extracted
by using 1% β-DDM in a buffer containing 50mM Tris pH 8.0, 300mM NaCl and 1mg/mL
iodoacetimide was added followed by purification on Ni2+ resin in 50mM Tris pH 8.0,
300mM NaCl, 0.05% α-DDM and finished with size exclusion chromatography on a
superdex S200 (GE Healthcare) with 20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl 0.05% α-DDM.
For ELISA, purified TmrAB was biotinylated, using EZ-Link NHS-Chromogenic-Biotin
(Pierce) as described previously15.
Phagemids were used for myc tagged Fab (Fab-myc) expression without further
modification15. For constructs to express flag tagged Fab (Fab-flag), the myc tag in the
phagemid was replaced with the flag tag by PCR site directed mutagenesis with a primer
encoding DYKDDDDK. The amplified PCR products were cloned in at BstEII and NotI
sites in the phagemids.

Author Manuscript

Fabs were expressed in Escherichia coli with IPTG induction. Phagemids encoding each
Fab gene were transformed into BL21 (DE3) Gold (Stratagene). Transformed cells were
grown in 2YT containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose (2YT Amp Glu) at 250 rpm
at 30°C overnight. The overnight culture was aliquoted into fresh 2YT Amp 0.1% Glu such
that OD600 is around 0.05. The cultures were grown at 250 rpm at 37°C until the log phase
where OD600 is between 0.5 and 0.8 and induced with 1mM IPTG. The induced cultures
were grown at 200 rpm at 20°C overnight.

E. coli expressed Fabs were subject to periplasmic protein fractionation by osmotic shock.
Cell pellets of the induced cultures were resuspended in ice-cold TES buffer (0.2M Tris
pH8, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.5M sucrose), followed by an equal volume of ice-cold ddH2O
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (complete EDTA-free, Roche). The cell resuspension
was incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle swirling every 10 min and spun down at 13000g
for 15 min. The supernatant was collected for further purification.

Author Manuscript

The periplasmic fraction was subject to affinity chromatography by a batch procedure using
Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (QIAGEN) and a standard protocol recommended by the
manufacturer. Purified Fabs were dialyzed against PBS buffer. For complex formation, the
Fab samples were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75
(Pharmacia Biotech). For cryo-EM, TmrAB and Fab were mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio
respectively, incubated for 30 min at room temperature and subject to size exclusion
chromatography, using Superdex 200 (Pharmacia Biotech). All samples for cryo-EM were
prepared and stored in 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.05 % αDDM.
Fab Selection
Our Fab selection procedure has been described previously15. For a brief summary, the
procedure included indirect immobilization of biotinylated TmrAB to streptavidin-coated
magnetic beads, three rounds of selection of phage displayed Fabs that bind to TmrAB, and
identification of binders by an ELISA screen, which used Fabs with unknown
concentrations. In the Fab nomenclature, the first letters designated plates, and the second
letters and the numbers designate well positions.

Qualitative and Competitive ELISA
Qualitative ELISA was done as described previously15. TmrAB was coated in the wells of
Maxisorp plates (Nunc) and Fab solutions at unknown concentrations were added to the
wells for binding. Fab solutions were prepared by serial dilutions of unpurified Fabs to yield
series of relative concentrations.

Author Manuscript

Competitive ELISA was done in the same way as qualitative ELISA analysis using relative
Fab concentrations15, with the following modifications: 1) Equal volumes of Fab-myc and
Fab-flag solutions were added for each binding reaction. Unpurified Fab-myc at varying
concentrations was prepared by serial dilution. Unpurified undiluted Fab-flag was kept at a
constant concentration. 2) Duplicates for each binding reaction were set up. 3) Anti-c-mycperoxidase (Roche) was added in one reaction, and anti-flag® M2-peroxidase (Sigma) was
added in the other. In Fig. 1, binding reactions for each graph contain AD12-myc at varying
concentrations and Fab-flag at constant concentrations, and TmrAB immobilized on wells.
AD12-myc concentration in each binding reaction was relative to undiluted supernatant of
AD12-myc culture that was considered 1. Normalized ELISA signals = (ELISA signal of
Fab-flag in each binding reaction)/(ELISA signal of Fab-flag when [AD12-myc] = 0); *
Normalized maximum binding of Fab-flag =1. Bound Fabs were detected by anti-flag® M2peroxidase.

Analytical HPLC Measurments

Author Manuscript

TmrAB ATPase activity and nucleotide stochiometry measurments were performed with
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chomragraphy (HPLC) using an Agilent 1100
system. For all measuremennts, TmrAB and nucleotide (ATP/ADP) standards underwent
organic extraction in the same manner with 25:24:1 (v/v) phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol. The aqueous layer was resolved using a C18 column (Vydac, 218TP104) and
gradient elution (solvent A: 100 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.0; solvent B: 90% methanol) with
absorbance measurements recorded at 254 nm.
Cysteine cross-linking

Author Manuscript

TmrAB double cysteine mutants were created to test the proximity of the nucleotide binding
domains in the apo state. Two double-cysteine mutant constructs were generated,
TmrA_A591C/TmrB_A567C and TmrA_L595A/TmrB_G564C. A591C/A567C was
designed using the primers 5′ –
GGCCAAGGGCGGCTACTACGCCTGCTTGTACCGGCTCCAGTTCCAG – 3′ and 5′ –
CAGGCCGGAGGCCTCTACTGCGAGATGGACCGCCTGCAG – 3′ and L565C/G564C
using 5′- CCGCCTTGTACCGGTGCCAGTTCCAGGAGGC – 3′ and 5′ –
GAGAGCCTCCTTCAGGCCGGATGCCTCTACGCGGAGATGGACCGCCTG – 3′. Note
that TmrAB contains an exposed native cysteine residue (TmrA-416C) that could not be
removed.

Author Manuscript

The double cysteine mutants were purified without nucleotides following the similar
procedure as used for the wild type TmrAB, with β-DDM (1 ∼ 1.05%) used for protein
extraction and no iodoacetimide added. Cross-linking of TmrAB with double cysteine
mutations was assessed in the presence or absence of 1mM Cu2+ Phenanthroline, 0.7mM
AMPPNP or ATP/Na+ orthovanadate (5mM) with or without 5mM MgCl2 as indicated in
the label of Extended Data Figure 9b. All nucleotides were heated to 68°C, the permissive
temperature for maximal ATP hydrolysis, for 3.5min followed by immediate cooling on ice
followed by 1mM Copper Phenanthroline (Sigma) induced crosslinking for 30 minutes on
ice. Crosslinking was quenched with 125mM EDTA in a non-reducing SDS loading buffer
and immediately loaded onto SDS-page for analysis.
Expression level of L595C/G564C was much lower than that of A591C/A567C.
Nevertheless, L595C/G564C could be purified and was assessed for cross-linking with and
without the oxidizing reagent Cu2+ phenanthroline at a lower concentration (567nM)
because of lower yields. Crosslinking in both cases proceeded to >99% as judged by SDS
page.

Author Manuscript

The A591C/A567C mutant activity was compared to the wild-type protein following crosslinking with Copper Phenanthroline followed by buffer exchange on Millipore spin
concentrators. Samples were incubated with 73.28nM TmrAB, 2.09mM MgCl2and 1mM
Copper Phenanthroline for 30min, followed by 3 ∼100 fold dilutions with the purification
buffer (20mM Hepes, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% α-DDM). Samples were then incubated with
ATP at a final concentration of 70nM transporter, 2mM MgCl2, and 250μM ATP (pH 7.0) at
60°C for 1 hour in preparation for analytical HPLC analysis.

Negative Stain EM

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Each Fab and TmrAB were mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio in pH 7.4 PBS containing 0.05% ßDDM, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and negatively stained using uranyl
formate. EM grids of negatively stained samples were prepared as previously described30.
Specifically, 2.5 μl samples of detergent solubilized TmrAB alone or in complex with Fabs
were applied to glow-discharged EM Cu grids covered by a thin layer of continuous carbon
film and were stained with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate. Negatively stained EM grids were
observed on a Tecnai T12 microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 120kV.
Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 52 kX using a 4K × 4K CCD camera
(UltraScan 4000, Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA), corresponding to a pixel size of 2.21 Å on
the specimen. All images were binned to the final pixel size of 4.42 Å for further processing.
Particles were selected manually and were subjected to 6 cycles of multi-reference
alignment (MRA) and K-means classification using SPIDER31. Approximately 3,000
particles for the TmrAB-Fab complex were manually picked from each sample and used for
2D analysis. 60 classes were generated for TmrAB in complex with single Fabs except DH5,
and all double Fabs. 50 classes were generated for TmrAB in complex with DH5.
Cryo-EM

Author Manuscript

Cryo-EM grids were prepared by a standard plunge freezing procedure as described16.
Specifically, Quantifoil grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Germany) were glowdischarged for 10 sec and a 2 μl sample was loaded onto the grid and plunge-frozen in liquid
ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using a Vitrobot Mark III (FEI Company). CryoEM grids
of the TmrAB-AH5, -BA6 complexes and TmrAB alone were imaged using a Tecnai TF20
electron microscope equipped with a field emission source (FEI Company) and operated at
200 kV. Images were collected at a nominal magnification of 80 kX using a TemF816 8K ×
8K CMOS camera (TVIPS GmbH, Gauting, Germany) corresponding to a pixel size of
0.935 Å on the specimen. All images were binned by a factor of 4 for further processing,
resulting in a pixel size of 3.74 Å. Images were recorded with a defocus in the range from
-2.0 to -3.5 μm. Defocus values were determined for each micrograph using CTFFIND332.

For the AH5 complex, an addition dataset was collected using Tecnai TF30 Polara equipped
with a field emission source and operated at 300kV. Images were recorded on a Gatan K2
Summit camera operated in super-resolution counting mode following the established dose
fractionation data acquisition protocol16. Specifically, images from TF30 were recorded at a
nominal magnification of 20 kX, corresponding to a calibrated super resolution pixel size of
0.98 Å on the specimen. The dose rate on the camera was set to be ∼8 counts
(corresponding to ∼9.9 electrons) per physical pixel per second. The total exposure time
was 16 seconds, leading to a total accumulated dose of 41 e-/Å2 on the specimen. Each
image was fractionated into 32 subframes, each with an accumulation time of 0.5 s/frame.
All dose-fractionated cryo-EM images were recorded using a semi-automated acquisition
program UCSFImage4 (written by Xueming Li). Images were recorded with a defocus in a
range from -2.5 to -4.0μm. All super-resolution counting images were binned by 2 × 2 for
further processing, resulting in a pixel size of 1.96 Å. All 32 motion corrected subframes
were averaged together to a single micrograph for subsequent processing. Defocus values
were determined for each micrograph using CTFFIND332. For the dataset of the AH5

complex collected with TF20 microscope, the particles were manually picked. For all other
datasets, we used a semi-automated particle picking procedure similar as described
recently11,33. For each dataset, we manually selected ∼2,000 particles and generated 2D
class averages using reference-free classification followed by multiple rounds of multireference alignment (MRA) and classification. Unique 2D class averages were used as
templates for automated particle picking. All picked particles were subject to visual
inspection to remove all possible bad particles. Initial 3D models were generated using the
common lines method34 and filtered to 60 Å resolution as the initial reference for further
refinement. 3D reconstructions were calculated and refined using Relion28. The resolutions
of final 3D reconstructions were estimated using gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation
(FSC) curve = 0.143 criteria17. The final map was sharpened by a resolution dependent
amplitude-scaling factor35 and implemented in xmipp36. Local resolution was estimated
using ResMap18. All cryo-EM image process parameters are listed in Extended Data Table
S1, which also shows that adding Fab, and using direct electron detection camera improved
the alignment accuracy and resolution of 3D reconstructions. Local correlations between
maps are computed using “vop localCorrelation” function in UCSF Chimera (Extended Data
Fig 7). The difference in resolution may contribute to the low correlation at certain regions.
Fitting of Atomic Structures

Author Manuscript

A homology model of TmrAB was generated using SWISS-MODEL Automated Mode37
and the atomic structure of heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/TM288 with one AMPPNP
bound (PDB code: 3QF4) used as the template. The atomic structure of a Fab (PDB code:
1M71) was used to fit the Fab density of either AH5 or BA6. Atomic models of TmrAB and
Fab were docked into the 3D reconstructions using the “fit-in-map” function in UCSF
Chimera38. Handedness was determined at this stage. The difference of fitting between the
default map and its mirrored version is significant by visual inspection. The docked models
were further refined by molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF)19. The initial homology
model shows an unstructured region between TM1 and TM2 of TmrA due to lack of
corresponding sequence in the template. We analyzed the sequence around the region using
the Quick2D function in MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit39 and part of it was predicted to form a
helix by multiple prediction methods. Therefore, we built a short segment of helix for that
part using the “Build Structure” function in UCSF Chimera. That helical segment fitted well
in the density map. All molecular graphics images were produced using UCSF Chimera38.
Structure analysis

Author Manuscript

Sequence identity between the TmrAB chains and the TM287/288 model were determined
with the clustalW webserver. Internal cavities that are connected to the external environment
are visualized using the 3V algorithm40. This procedure uses 1.5Å sphere to represent water
and calculates a completely accessible volume. The protein surface environment is
calculated with a 12Å sphere that cannot access inner cavities, and the two volumes are
subtracted to provide only those areas buried that water can enter from the external
environment. In this calculation, only one large interconnected cavity was identified in the
interior of TmrAB, connected to the surface via a cleft between TM4 and TM6. Buried
surface area calculations were calculated in Pymol.

Author Manuscript

a, Expression levels of Fabs used in ELISA in Fig 1a. Expression levels were assessed by
immunoblotting with anti-c-myc antibody and normalized against the highest expression
level such that undiluted AD12 equals normalized relative concentration of 1. Binding was
monitored by anti-c-myc antibody. b, ELISA with purified Fabs against TmrAB. Purified
flag tagged Fabs (Fab-flag) were used in binding reactions. Binding was monitored by antiflag® M2-peroxidase. Experiments were repeated twice. c, Relative affinities of the Fabs.
The ELISA signal data from the Extended Data Fig 1b were fit to a bimolecular binding
equation to produce binding curves and apparent Kd values. AH5 showed the highest
affinity, followed by BA6, AD12 and AH11. DH5 and BG12 did not show significant
binding. Apparent Kd values do not yield meaningful biophysical properties because the
concentration of TmrAB participating in the binding reaction is unknown and the transporter
is not free in solution. However, comparison among the Fabs should be sufficient enough to
determine their relative affinities. Despite unpurified DH5 showed significant binding

Percentages of complex particles were assessed by fractions of the numbers of images that
clearly show Fab densities (# complex particles) to the total numbers of images that were

Summary of TmrAB structure determination by single particle cryo-EM. We determined
three 3D reconstructions of TmrAB complexed with a Fab, AH5 or BA6, and a 3D
reconstruction of TmrAB alone, using two different microscopes, TF30 Polara and TF20.
TF30 Polara is equipped with a K2 Summit camera, and TF20 is equipped with an 8K × 8K
phosphor scintillator based CMOS camera. All 3D reconstructions were determined using
RELION. Parameters of accuracy (marked with *) were obtained from RELION. The
rotational accuracy of refinement of TmrAB in complex with Fabs (6.5° ∼ 7.3°) is
significantly better than the TmrAB alone (9.5°), suggesting that the Fabs improved the
accuracy of angular refinement.

a, Qualitative ELISA to assess Fab binding to TmrAB. All Fabs showed binding to TmrAB
except BG12 in both experiments A and B where independently prepared Fab samples were
used. Expression levels were assessed by immunoblotting and normalized (Extended Data
Fig 1a). b, Representative competitive ELISA between AD12-myc and Fab-flag against
TmrAB. AD12-myc binding was not affected by the presence of AH5-flag or DH5-flag (top
left). AH5-flag and DH5-flag maintained near maximum binding (*) at all AD12-myc
concentrations (top right). AD12-myc binding was almost abolished in the presence of
AD12-flag or BA6-flag (middle left). AD12-flag and BA6-flag maintained near maximum
binding (*) at all AD12-myc concentrations (middle right). AD12-myc binding was not
significantly affected in the presence of AH11-flag (bottom left). AH11-flag binding
decreased as AD12-myc concentrations increased shown (bottom right). Uninhibited
binding of AD12-myc and Fab-flag suggests independent binding between AD12 and AH5
or DH5. Inhibited binding of either AD12-myc or Fab-flag suggests overlapping epitopes
between AD12 and BA6 or AH11. c, Representative negative stain 2D class averages of
TmrAB-Fab complexes. d, Immunoblotting of TmrAB, using Fab-flag. Class A Fabs
recognized the denatured form of TmrB, and AH5 did not recognize the denatured form of
either strand. BG12 was used as a non-binder control, which did not detect either strand
significantly.

Figure 2. 3D reconstruction of TmrAB-AH5 at subnanometer resolution

Author Manuscript

a, Cryo-EM density map of the TmrAB-AH5 complex filtered to a resolution of 8.2Å. The
atomic model of TmrAB and an atomic structure of a Fab (pdb code: 1M71) are docked into
the density map. The map shows two NBDs, a bi-lobed DDM micelle, which is separated by
TM4 (marked by two dashed lines in the top view), and well-defined AH5 density. In the
bottom view, two parallel solid lines and dashed lines indicate orientations of the front and
back halves of the micelle respectively. The two halves are tilted by ∼30° with each other.
b, The density map at a higher isosurface threshold shows clearly resolved TM helices. c, A
cross section view through the TMDs shows well resolved TM helices labeled red and blue
for TmrA and TmrB respectively. d, NBDs of TmrAB in two different views. C-terminal
helices (*) of the two NBDs are in close proximity depicted in both of the density map and
the docked atomic model.

Figure 3. Atomic model of TmrAB showing the laterally open inward-facing conformation

Author Manuscript

a, Representation of internal volume and opening to the external surface of the transporter.
TmrA is colored salmon and TmrB is colored cyan. b, Two different views (tilted around the
axis perpendicular to the membrane plan) of the substrate-binding cavity in the TMDs.
Density bound to helix H4 (Tyr187) and H5 (His246) of TmrB was observed at a threshold
of 5σ. It has the size to accommodate a Hoechst 33342 molecule, which is a known cargo
molecule of TmrAB, but was not added during the protein purification. The cargo-like
density is inside the cavity but near the inner leaflet of membrane. This position suggests a
possible substrate pathway. c, Ribbon diagram of the TmrAB NBDs in the nucleotide free
state. Predicted locations of two pairs of cysteine mutations are marked. d, Non-reducing
SDS-PAGE gel demonstrating disulfide cross-linking of both double cysteine mutants in the
apo-state, and showed a clear difference in cross-linking behavior between nucleotide free
and bound TmrAB.

Figure 4. Comparison of the inward facing conformation of TmrAB with the intermediate
inward facing structure of TM287/288 and the outward facing structure of Sav1866

Author Manuscript

a, Conformational changes in NBDs viewed from the membrane towards the cytosol. The
Walker A motifs (blue) do not face the ABC signature motifs (green) in the atomic model of
TmrAB (top) while they do in the TM287/288 structure (middle), but a single AMPPNP
molecule (shown as sticks) is bound predominantly in one NBD. In the Sav1866 structure
(bottom), the two motifs from the opposite domains come close to sandwich two ADP
molecules (shown as sticks). b, Changes in lateral opening to the cavity. The lateral opening
between TM4 and TM6 shown by dashed lines (left) narrows down from the TmrAB model
(top) to the TM287/288 structure (middle), and completely closes in the Sav1866 structure
(bottom), resulting in an opening to the extracellular space.
