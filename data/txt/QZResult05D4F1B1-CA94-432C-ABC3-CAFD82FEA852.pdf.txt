Abstract
The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reversal, mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), are
fundamental processes involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. SEMA3F is a secreted semaphorin and
tumor suppressor downregulated by TGF-b1 and ZEB1-induced EMT. Here, we report that neuropilin (NRP)-2,
the high-afﬁnity receptor for SEMA3F and a coreceptor for certain growth factors, is upregulated during TGF-b1–
driven EMT in lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, NRP2 upregulation was TbRI dependent and SMAD independent, occurring mainly at a posttranscriptional level involving increased association of mRNA with polyribosomes. Extracellular signal—regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT inhibition blocked NRP2 upregulation, whereas
RNA interference-mediated attenuation of ZEB1 reduced steady-state NRP2 levels. In addition, NRP2 attenuation
inhibited TGF-b1–driven morphologic transformation, migration/invasion, ERK activation, growth suppression,
and changes in gene expression. In a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer, NRP2 attenuation also inhibited
locally invasive features of the tumor and reversed TGF-b1–mediated growth inhibition. In support of these
results, human lung cancer specimens with the highest NRP2 expression were predominantly E-cadherin
negative. Furthermore, the presence of NRP2 staining strengthened the association of E-cadherin loss with
high-grade tumors. Together, our results demonstrate that NRP2 contributes signiﬁcantly to TGF-b1–induced
EMT in lung cancer. Cancer Res; 73(23); 7111–21. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer accounts for nearly one-ﬁfth of cancer deaths
worldwide, with invasion, metastases, and drug resistance
representing major barriers to cure. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), by which epithelial cells acquire a
mesenchymal and invasive phenotype, contributes signiﬁcantly to these barriers (1). TGF-b is a major inducer of the EMT (2),
affecting lung cancer cells, acting either alone or in combination with cytokines or growth factors (3–5). In canonical TGF-b
signaling, binding to the type I/II receptor (TbRI/TbRII) comAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Division of Hematology-Oncology, 2Department of

plex leads to phosphorylation of SMAD-2/3, their interaction
with SMAD-4 and nuclear translocation (6). In contrast, noncanonical signaling is SMAD independent involving AKT,
extracellular signal—regulated kinase (ERK), and other pathways (7, 8). In lung cancer, as with many malignant diseases,
upregulation of TGF-b is a poor prognostic marker (9). Among
other activities, TGF-b secretion by tumor cells and stromal
components stimulates ﬁbroblasts and extracellular matrix
formation, while it inhibits antitumor immune responses (9).
However, proliferation is also inhibited by TGF-b, suggesting
why some tumors mutate or downregulate key TGF-b signaling
components (10–12). The EMT process impairs growth of
metastatic deposits, whereas its reversal, mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), is associated with increased proliferation and tumor growth (13). In human breast cancer, a partial
EMT phenotype may be sufﬁcient to facilitate invasion and
vascular dissemination, as evidenced by circulating tumor cells
and tumor cell clusters coexpressing epithelial and mesenchymal markers (14).
We previously demonstrated that SEMA3F, a secreted tumor
suppressor isolated from a recurrent 3p deletion region in lung
cancer (15), was downregulated by the EMT transcription
factor, ZEB1 (16). The secreted class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3)
were discovered as inhibitors of nerve growth cone migration,
and subsequently shown to function in various developmental
and pathologic processes, including cancer (17). Neuropilin
(NRP)-1 and 2 are high-afﬁnity receptors for the SEMA3s,
with SEMA3F binding predominantly to NRP2 (18, 19). In
addition, both neuropilins were identiﬁed as coreceptors for

VEGF and other selected growth factors (18, 20, 21). Importantly, neuropilins are overexpressed in several cancers, including lung, and their expression correlates with increased invasion and poor prognosis (22).
Because SEMA3F is downregulated during EMT in lung
cancer cells, we asked what happens to NRP2. In contrast
with SEMA3F, NRP2 is upregulated by TGF-b and contributes
signiﬁcantly to the changes associated with induction of the
EMT phenotype. Mechanistically, NRP2 upregulation was predominantly translational, involving increased mRNA binding
of polyribosomes. Initial NRP2 upregulation was SMAD independent and blocked by ERK and AKT inhibitors, whereas
ZEB1 knockdown reduced steady-state NRP2 levels. In a
xenograft model, we found that NRP2 contributes signiﬁcantly
to the invasive phenotype of lung cancer cells, as well as TGFb1–mediated growth inhibition, which seems to be, at least in
part, cell autonomous. In resected human lung cancers, high
NRP2 staining together with low E-cadherin was associated
with increased tumor grade. Moreover, tumors with the highest NRP2 scores were predominantly E-cadherin negative.
Together, these results indicate that NRP2 upregulation plays
an important role in TGF-b1–induced EMT.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and expression constructs
Non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines HCC4006, NCI-H441, NCI-H358, and A549 were obtained from the
Colorado Lung Cancer SPORE Cell Repository. Veriﬁcation of
NSCLC cell lines (by comparison with American Type Culture
Collection data) was carried out using microsatellite genotyping analysis performed by the University of Colorado DNA
Sequencing and Analysis Core (Aurora, CO). Cells were grown
in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen) at 37 C and 5% CO2.
Recombinant human TGF-b1 (5 or 10 ng/mL) was from R&D
Systems. Inhibitors were from the following suppliers:
SB431542 (StemGent), U0126 (Promega), cycloheximide (Calbiochem), MKK-2206 (Selleckchem), actinomycin-D (SigmaAldrich), hygromycin, blasticidin, puromycin, and doxycycline
were from Invitrogen.
Stable integration of TGF-b1 under the control of a tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible promoter was obtained with the
Flp-In T-Rex System from Invitrogen. Empty vector or TGFb1–transfected cells were selected and grown with 100 mg/mL
hygromycin and 5 mg/mL blasticidin. Doxycycline was used at
100 ng/mL. SMAD7 in pRK5 was stably cotransfected with
pcDNA3 and selected with 500 mg/mL G418. Stable short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfections were generated from lentiviral particles (Sigma-Aldrich; Supplementary Table S1).
Transfection was performed using 8 mg/mL polybrene, and
cells were selected with 2 mg/mL puromycin.
RNA and protein analysis
Total RNA extraction protocol and gene expression analysis
by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis were
described previously (4). Data were expressed as the percentage
of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table S2.

containing RPMI-1640 as an attractant. Fifty-thousand H358
cells or 25,000 A549 cells were suspended in 0.5 mL serum
free RPMI-1640 and added to the upper chamber followed by
the addition of TGF-b or control solutions. H358 cells were
incubated for 48 hours and A549 cells for 12 hours at 37 C,
5% CO2. Cells were then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
stained with crystal violet, rinsed, and cells remaining on the
upper side of the ﬁlter were removed. After allowing the
ﬁlters to dry overnight, cells were counted under a SMZ1500
stereomicroscope (Nikon). Each condition was performed in
triplicate and four ﬁelds were counted per ﬁlter. ShControl
transfectants were included in each experiment to assess
reproducibility.
Proliferation assay
Control or NRP2 knockdown H358-Tr-TGF-b cells (5  104
cells/plate) were cultured in the presence or absence of
doxycycline (100 ng/mL), trypsinized and counted at days 2
and 4. Doubling time was calculated using the following
formula: T ¼ t  ln(2)/(ln(N4)-ln(N2)) in which T is the
doubling time, t is the time between two measurements, N4
is the ﬁnal number of cells at day 4, and N2 is the number of
cells measured at day 2. This experiment was repeated three
times.
Tumor xenografts and human lung tumor microarrays
One million H358-shControl, H358-shNRP2-B, H358-TrTGF-b1-shControl, or H358-Tr-TGF-b1-shNRP2-B cells suspended in 200 mL of 50% Matrigel were injected subcutaneously in the right ﬂank of 6-week-old female athymic nude mice
(10 mice per group; Hsd: Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu, Harlan). After
sacriﬁce, tumors were removed and weighed. Half of each
tumor was placed into optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
compound and the remainder ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight, then incubated in 70% ethanol overnight before
parafﬁn embedding. All animal experiments were approved
by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (Charleston, SC).
TMA slides containing 109 lung tumor samples and 10
normal lung tissues were obtained from US Biomax (ref:
BC041115). These were processed for immunohistochemistry
as described above.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were computed on TMA expression
scores for all genes, as well as clinical characteristics. Oneway ANOVA was used to test the association between EMT
status [NRP2(þ)/Ecadherin() or NRP2()/Ecadherin(þ)]
and clinical characteristics that are categorical variables namely sex, histology, and tumor-node-metastasis stage. Correlations between the EMT status and age or tumor grade were
analyzed using Fisher exact test. In addition to analyzing
expression scores as continuous variables, each gene's expression level was also dichotomized: a score of 0 to 10 was
considered negative and a score above 10 was considered
positive; McNemar test was used to compare the dichotomous
gene expression. Correlations between genes were analyzed
using Spearman statistics. The na€ve P values of these correla-

www.aacrjournals.org

tions were adjusted for multiple comparisons controlling for
false discovery rate. Statistical analyses were performed using
SAS/BASE and SAS/STAT software, Version 9.2 of the SAS
System for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc.). To determine the
relative effects of NRP2 shRNAs on migration/invasion, the log
of the number of migrating cells per ﬁeld was modeled as a
function of shRNA (e.g., shNRP2-B vs. shNRP2-Y vs. shControl)
and TGF-b (yes vs. no) using linear regression modeling. Model
estimates were used to derive estimates of fold-changes comparing conditions, P values for testing statistical signiﬁcance of
fold-change, and calculating 95% conﬁdence intervals for foldchanges. Appropriateness of linear regression assumptions
was assessed using residual plots. The signiﬁcance of the
differences between proliferation levels in xenografts and
between E-cadherin scores in the TMA was assessed using
the Student t test.

Results
NRP2 is upregulated by TGF-b1 in lung cancer cell lines
To determine whether NRP1/2 levels were affected by EMT,
we treated four NSCLC cell lines containing epithelial features
with exogenous TGF-b1 for 1 to 3 days. Varying levels of
increased NRP2 protein were evident along with expected
changes in EMT markers (Fig. 1A). In contrast with NRP2, no
consistent changes were observed in NRP1 and it was not
further examined.
To explore NRP2 upregulation in more detail, we focused
on two cell lines, H358 and A549. Although both are epithelial
in nature, A549 is partially shifted toward mesenchymal
differentiation, as evidenced by lower E-cadherin, higher Ncadherin, and higher ZEB1 levels (4). Moreover, the morphologic response and downregulation of E-cadherin to TGF-b
occur more rapidly in A549 cells. As expected for a cell surface
receptor, increased NRP2 protein was observed at the plasma
membrane (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Consistently, NRP2
upregulation was observed by 8 hours (Supplementary Fig.
S1B), and with repeated exogenous TGF-b1, the effect was
persistent at 10 days (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Chronic TGFb1 exposure was obtained by stable transfection in H358 cells
(H358-Tr-TGF-b1), which while doxycycline inducible, exhibited signiﬁcant leaky expression. In the absence of doxycycline, these cells produced 33% more activated TGF-b1 than
vector controls (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This level was
sufﬁcient to upregulate NRP2 protein, as shown in Fig. 1B,
whereas the addition of doxycycline further increased both
TGF-b1 and NRP2 (see Fig. 2A below and Supplementary
Fig. S1D).
Compared with controls, steady-state NRP2 protein in H358Tr-TGF-b1 cells was increased by approximately 8-fold, whereas mRNA was only 1.5-fold higher (Fig. 1C). Similar results were
obtained with short-term exogenous TGF-b1, although the
magnitude of the NRP2 protein upregulation was less (i.e.,
2–4-fold). To gain further insight, we examined mRNA and
protein stability following TGF-b1 stimulation and the addition of actinomycin-D or cycloheximide, respectively. However, neither was increased (Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1F). We
then asked whether TGF-b1 affected protein translation using

doxycycline, 100 ng/mL for 3 days, lysed, and fractionated on linear sucrose gradients. A representative A280 trace and electrophoretic analysis of RNA is
shown in the top and bottom, respectively. The appearance of the fractions and mRNAs from control and H358-Tr-TGF-b1 cells was essentially
identical. NRP2 and GAPDH mRNA levels were measured in each fraction by qRT-PCR (middle). The y-axis gives the relative expression on a log
scale, normalized to the initial fraction, plotted against individual fractions from the gradient.

sucrose gradient fractions from doxycycline-treated control
and H358-Tr-TGF-b1 cells (Fig. 1D). Increased translation
should lead to an increase in the number of ribosomes associated with NRP2 mRNA. Indeed, TGF-b1 caused an approximate 4-fold increase of NRP2 mRNA in the heavy polysome
fractions. In contrast, the distribution of GAPDH mRNA
was unchanged. These results were reproducible and speciﬁc
to TGF-b induction. Together, these data indicate that
NRP2 protein upregulation predominantly involves increased
mRNA-polyribosome association.
NRP2 upregulation, TGF-b signaling, and ZEB1
Canonical TGF-b signaling leads to activation of TbRI and RSMAD 2/3 phosphorylation, which can be blocked by
SB431542. As shown in Fig. 2A, pretreatment with SB431542
reduced baseline NRP2 expression due to endogenous TGF-b
in control and uninduced H358-Tr-TGF-b1 cells. SB431542 also
blocked NRP2 upregulation by exogenous TGF-b1 in both cell
lines (Figs. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). When SB431542
was added to H358-Tr-TGF-b cells already exposed to doxycycline for 2 days, NRP2 levels dropped despite continued
doxycycline treatment (Fig. 2A). To determine whether NRP2
upregulation was SMAD dependent, the R-SMAD antagonist,
SMAD7, was overexpressed in A549 cells before addition of
TGF-b1 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2B). After 24 hours,
SMAD7 blocked the upregulation of SNAIL, a known SMAD
target gene. However, SMAD7 did not inhibit NRP2 induction
at either the protein or mRNA levels.

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

Noncanonical TGF-b signaling includes ERK and AKT pathways (7, 8). In A549 cells, inhibition of ERK or AKT with U0126
and MKK-2206, respectively, impaired NRP2 upregulation by
TGF-b1, whereas combining the inhibitors was more effective
(Figs. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2C for full time course).
Similar results were obtained with the individual inhibitors in
H358 cells, although the combination did not result in a greater
effect.
We previously reported that ZEB1 inhibits expression of the
tumor suppressor, SEMA3F, which uses NRP2 as its highafﬁnity receptor (16). ZEB1 is also upregulated by TGF-b1 in
NSCLC cell lines (e.g., as shown in Fig. 2A) and is the EMT
transcription factor best correlated with steady-state mesenchymal features (4, 25). In A549 cells, shRNA targeting of ZEB1
led to reduced steady-state levels of NRP2 (Fig. 2D). ZEB1
knockdown also reduced NRP2 levels after treatment with
exogenous TGF-b in A549 cells (Figs. 2E and Supplementary
Fig. S2D), and after 5 days of doxycycline induction in H358-TrTGF-b1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E). However, in short-term
experiments up to 8 hours, NRP2 upregulation occurred without a detectable change in ZEB1 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Moreover, ZEB1 levels were unaffected by the MEK and AKT
inhibitors that blocked NRP2 upregulation. These results
suggest that although ZEB1 may not be involved in the initial
phase of NRP2 upregulation, it contributes to NRP2 maintenance. Although SNAIL reportedly contributes to ZEB1 upregulation (26), blocking SNAIL with SMAD7 had no effect on
ZEB1 levels after 24 hours of TGF-b (Fig. 2B).

NRP2 knockdown impairs downstream TGF-b1
responses
To assess the effects of NRP2 on TGF-b1 activities, we
stably transfected control and NRP2-targeting shRNAs into
H358 and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
Morphologically, NRP2 knockdown inhibited the mesenchymal transformation of A549 cells (Fig. 3A); similar results
were obtained in H358 cells treated with exogenous TGF-b1
and H358-Tr-TGF-b induced with doxycycline (Supplementary Fig. S4). Using Transwell assays, NRP2 knockdown
inhibited both baseline and TGF-b1–stimulated migration
(Fig. 3B). Likewise, invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes was impaired.
The effect of NRP2 knockdown on TGF-b1–induced
changes in gene expression and signaling was also examined. NRP2 knockdown blunted the suppression of epithelial

genes, as well as upregulation of mesenchymal genes (Supplementary Fig. S3C). As indicated above, TGF-b1 signaling
led to ERK and AKT phosphorylation. Although the kinetics
differed, NRP2 knockdown consistently inhibited ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3D). NRP2
knockdown also inhibited AKT phosphorylation, but only in
H358 cells. In hepatic stellate cells, NRP1 knockdown was
shown to shift SMAD phosphorylation from SMAD2/3 to
SMAD1/5, and NRP2 was stated to have a similar effect (27).
However, in multiple experiments under a variety of conditions, NRP2 knockdown had no effect on SMAD2/3 or
SMAD1/5 phosphorylation in these lung cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S3E). In contrast, NRP1 knockdown did
enhance SMAD1/5 phosphorylation without affecting phospho-SMAD2/3, although long exposure times were required
to detect this (Supplementary Fig. S3G). Together, we

TGF-b1 suppression of tumor growth is reversed by
NRP2 knockdown
To explore the consequences of NRP2 knockdown, we used
subcutaneous xenografts of control and uninduced H358-TrTGF-b1 cells stably transfected with nontargeting or NRP2
shRNAs. In the presence of wild-type NRP2 levels, the growth of
H358-Tr-TGF-b1 xenografts was substantially slowed (Fig. 4A).
This is consistent with the ability of TGF-b1 to inhibit epithelial
cell proliferation while driving the EMT process (6, 28). Ki67
staining demonstrated that proliferation was signiﬁcantly
inhibited by TGF-b (Fig. 4B). NRP2 knockdown, which was
conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S5),
completely restored growth of H358-Tr-TGF-b1 xenografts,
while it had no effect on the growth of control tumors. To
determine whether growth inhibition was autocrine in nature,
at least in part, we examined the consequences of TGF-b
exposure and NRP2 knockdown in vitro. These results paralleled the in vivo ﬁndings demonstrating that NRP2 knockdown
relieved the growth inhibition resulting from TGF-b1 (Fig. 4C).
In control and H358-Tr-TGF-b1 tumors expressing nontargeting shRNA, NRP2 staining was intensiﬁed in isolated tumor
cells and tumor cell clusters in the stroma (Fig. 4D and
Supplementary Fig. S5). These cells showed reduced staining
for the epithelial marker, pan-cytokeratin, suggesting that they
had undergone a partial mesenchymal transition and were
invasive. As anticipated from our morphologic observations in
vitro (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4), NRP2 knockdown
resulted in more regularly shaped tumor aggregates and fewer
cells that appeared invasive. Thus, we conclude that NRP2 is
important for TGF-b1–mediated effects on proliferation and
migration. However, although the changes induced by TGF-b1
are autocrine, at least in part, we cannot exclude additional
paracrine effects from the tumor microenvironment.
Increased NRP2 expression correlates with tumor grade
and E-cadherin in patient samples
In previous studies, we showed that E-cadherin, an epithelial
marker frequently lost during the EMT process, is absent in
10% to 30% of lung tumors (4, 29). However, this likely underestimates the number of tumors transiently progressing
through the EMT. In other studies, we reported that NRP2
levels signiﬁcantly increase in early lung lesions (30). On the
basis of our current ﬁndings and previous results, we hypothesized that tumors with high NRP2 and low E-cadherin would
be more aggressive. This was examined using a microarray
containing 109 resected human lung cancers. Overall, NRP2
and E-cadherin were expressed in 83 (76%) and 69 (63%)
tumors, respectively. Of 22 NRP2(þ)/Ecad() tumors, nine
were grade 3, whereas the rest were grade 2, and the association
with tumor grade was signiﬁcant (Fisher exact test, P ¼
0.0049; Table 1; Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Conversely, all NRP2()/Ecad(þ) tumors were grade 1 or 2. In both
scenarios, the use of NRP2 as a marker strengthened the
association of E-cadherin with tumor grade. We also hypothesized that high NRP2 scores would correlate with E-cadherin
loss. In fact, tumors with the highest NRP2 scores (>100) were
predominantly E-cadherin negative (7/9, P ¼ 0.0252), whereas
tumors with NRP2 scores less than 100 had higher mean

tributes signiﬁcantly to the development of the EMT phenotype. NRP2 induction was rapid, stable with continued TGF-b,
and present at the plasma membrane. Changes in NRP2 were
evident primarily at the protein level with modest increases in
mRNA. Experiments with cycloheximide or actinomycin-D
treatment indicated that neither NRP2 protein nor mRNA
were stabilized by TGF-b. Instead, we observed a reproducible
increase in the association of NRP2 mRNA with fractions
containing the heaviest polyribosomes, consistent with
increased translation. In comparison, the polysomal association of GAPDH mRNA was not altered by TGF-b.
Mechanistically, how increased NRP2 protein translation
occurs is unknown. The translation of many proteins is regulated by microRNAs (miR; ref. 31). Using the miRiam target

prediction tool (32), we identiﬁed 17 miRs or miR families and
39 high-probability binding sites in the 30 untranslated region
(UTR) of the major NRP2 isoform (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
However, using overlapping luciferase reporter constructs for
the NRP2 30 UTR, we failed to detect consistent changes after
exposure to exogenous TGF-b. Nevertheless, predicted binding
sites for the TGF-b–regulated miR-15b and miR-16 were
present, and although both were expressed at quite different
levels, they were inhibited by TGF-b. Further studies will be
required to determine their signiﬁcance. In addition, TGFb–regulated protein translation during EMT has been shown
to occur through heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1
(hnRNP E1), which binds a structural element in the 30 UTR of
Dab2 and ILEI (33). Stable knockdown of hnRNP E1 in NMuMG
cells was associated with NRP2 upregulation (Supplementary
Fig. S7B). More work will be required to determine whether
hnRNP E1 or another hnRNP has a direct role in the observed
NRP2 upregulation.
In the present study, we found that early NRP2 upregulation
was SMAD independent. This is based on the inability of
SMAD7 to block NRP2 increases, whereas a known SMAD
target gene, SNAIL, was inhibited. Among noncanonical signaling pathways activated by TGF-b, we found that ERK and
AKT inhibitors impaired NRP2 upregulation, and this effect
was greater when the inhibitors were combined. Mechanistically, both TbRI and TbRII can be phosphorylated on tyrosine
residues that serve as Shc recruitment sites, leading to activation of ERK (34). ERK activation is an essential component in
TGF-b–mediated EMT (35), leading in part to increased FRA-1/
c-JUN heterodimers and increased AP-1 activity (36–38). In
some cases, ERK activation is dependent only on TbRII (39).
However, our results demonstrating that NRP2 upregulation is
blocked by SB431542 indicates that TbRI is required. TbRI also
interacts with PI3K-p85, and TGF-b exposure activates AKT
with multiple downstream consequences (40, 41). There is also
cross-talk between the AKT and ERK/AP-1 pathways, because
AKT inhibition of GSK3 leads to reduced c-JUN degradation
(42). Furthermore, AKT2 phosphorylates and inactivates
hnRNP E1 (33), which potentially contributes to NRP2
upregulation. In contrast with ERK and AKT inhibitors,
p38 and c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) blockade had no effect on
NRP2 levels.

Changes in gene expression, a hallmark of EMT, result in
part from the upregulation of transcriptional repressors,
including ZEB1, that bind E-box elements in genomic DNA
(43). Previously, we found that ZEB1 was the repressor best
correlated with EMT features and EGF receptor inhibitor
resistance in NSCLC cell lines (4, 44). In addition, we reported
that ZEB1 bound E-box sites in the SEMA3F promoter and
suppressed its expression (16). Recently, we found that ZEB1
preferentially inhibits acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 in
the promoter region of ZEB1 target genes (45). In the current
study, ZEB1 knockdown inhibited NRP2 expression. However, ZEB1 levels were unchanged during early NRP2 induction, and ERK and AKT inhibitors, which blocked NRP2
upregulation, had no effect on ZEB1. Together, these results
suggest that ZEB1 acts as a maintenance factor for NRP2. A
similar requirement for ZEB1 in maintenance of a stable
mesenchymal phenotype was observed in breast cancer (46).
ZEB2 was identiﬁed as a Smad-interacting protein (47), and
subsequent studies demonstrated that both ZEB proteins
bind activated R-Smads (48, 49). Our studies do not exclude a
role for SMAD–ZEB1 interactions in the maintenance of
NRP2 or the possibility that maintenance and induction
involve different TGF-b–dependent pathways.
The EMT process is characterized by changes in morphology, loss of junctional complexes, increased migration/invasion, decreased proliferation and alterations in gene expression (1). NRP2 knockdown inhibited these TGF-b–induced
changes. In hepatic stellate cells exposed to TGF-b1, NRP1
knockdown was shown to reduce SMAD2/3 and increase
SMAD1/5 phosphorylation (27). These authors stated that
NRP2 knockdown elicited a similar response. However, we
found that in lung cancer cells, only NRP1 knockdown affected
SMAD phosphorylation. Thus, the two NRPs are not equivalent
in this context. The absence of a SMAD effect prompted us to
examine noncanonical pathways. Importantly, NRP2 deﬁciency consistently inhibited TGF-b–mediated ERK activation,
whereas there was no effect on JNK or p38. The kinetics of
ERK activation by TGF-b are known to be context dependent
(8) and this was apparent in the NSCLC cell lines. NRP2 also
inﬂuences ERK signaling in response to class 3 semaphorins or
VEGF (23, 50, 51), but to our knowledge, a role in noncanonical
TGF-b signaling has not been reported.

NRP2 Is Upregulated during EMT in Lung Cancer

In vivo, we found that TGF-b impaired the growth of
xenograft tumors by reducing proliferation, as previously
reported (25, 52). This was conﬁrmed by in vitro growth assays.
Our results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of TGF-b
has an autocrine component, at least in part, although we
cannot exclude an additional paracrine effect. Reduced levels
of TbRII have been described in about 40% of primary NSCLCs,
often associated with 50 CpG methylation (53). However, a
recent study reported that drug-resistant NSCLCs are linked
to high TbRII expression and EMT features, concomitant with
reduced proliferation, which may facilitate resistance to cytotoxic therapy (54). Moreover, elevated expression of TGF-b has
also been correlated with poor prognosis (9). Thus, the consequences of TGF-b signaling in lung cancer are context
dependent.
In xenograft tumors, increased NRP2 staining was present in
invasive-appearing isolated tumor cells and small tumor cell
clusters in the stroma displaying decreased pan-cytokeratin. Of
note, NRP2 knockdown resulted in more regularly shaped
tumor aggregates and fewer cells that appeared invasive.
Recent studies have conﬁrmed the importance of the EMT
process in tumor cell invasion and dissemination, while demonstrating that EMT reversal is critical for the subsequent
proliferation of these cells in metastatic sites (13, 14, 55).
Furthermore, a partial EMT phenotype seems sufﬁcient to
generate circulating tumor cells and tumor cell clusters (14),
reminiscent of what we observed in the stroma. In tumor
microarrays from resected human lung cancer specimens, we
speculated that high NRP2 expression would be associated
with reduced E-cadherin and less differentiation. Indeed,
tumors with the highest NRP2 scores were predominantly
E-cadherin negative, whereas reduced NRP2 was associated
with higher E-cadherin staining. Moreover, the presence of
NRP2 staining strengthened the association of E-cadherin loss
with high-grade tumors.
The role of NRP2 in tumor growth is almost certainly
complex and context dependent. In contrast with our results
in lung cancer cells, NRP2 expression was associated with
increased proliferation in a colorectal cancer model treated
with TGF-b (56). Presumably, these cells had escaped TGFb–mediated growth inhibition. Other studies have shown that
NRP2 knockdown inhibits survival, but not proliferation

(57–59). In addition, use of an anti-NRP2 function-blocking
antibody reduced tumor lymphatic vessels and the number of
lung metastases without affecting primary tumor growth (60).
Altogether, our results suggest that in lung cancer cells, NRP2 is
upregulated and contributes signiﬁcantly to TGF-b–mediated
EMT. Although NRP2 knockdown inhibited the invasive phenotype, it also rescued growth suppressed by TGF-b. Although
this would be a clinically undesired effect, these cells may be
more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy or other agents.
Finally, it would appear that the suppression of SEMA3F and
upregulation of NRP2 by TGF-b represents a coordinated
program contributing to the acquisition of a motile, invasive
phenotype.

Correction: Neuropilin-2 Is Upregulated in
Lung Cancer Cells during TGF-b1–Induced
Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition
In this article (Cancer Res 2013;73:7111–21), which was published in the December 1,
2013, issue of Cancer Research (1), an article (ref. 27, Cao and colleagues, J Biol Chem
2010;285:31840–8) was cited incorrectly, and the correct citation (Glinka and
colleagues, Carcinogenesis 2011;32:613–21) was not included.
The citation of ref. 27 on page 7,115 should read as follows:
In hepatic stellate cells, NRP1 knockdown was shown to shift SMAD phosphorylation from SMAD2/3 to SMAD1/5 (27). However, we have shown that in multiple
experiments under a variety of conditions, NRP2 knockdown had no effect on
SMAD2/3 or SMAD1/5 phosphorylation in these lung cancer cells.
The citation of ref. 27 on page 7,118 should read as follows:
In hepatic stellate cells exposed to TGF-b1, NRP1 knockdown was shown to reduce
SMAD2/3 and increase SMAD1/5 phosphorylation (27). In addition, NRP1 has been
shown to activate SMAD2/3 in breast cancer cells, whereas Nrp2 could "activate
LAP–TGFb1 (data not shown)" (61). These authors indicated that "Nrp1 and Nrp2
might be largely interchangeable in their interactions with TGFb components."
However, we found that in lung cancer cells, NRP2 knockdown had no effect on
SMAD signaling. Thus, the two NRPs are not equivalent in this context.
The new ref. 61 is as follows:
61. Glinka Y, Stoilova S, Mohammed N, Prud'homme GJ. Neuropilin-1 exerts
coreceptor function for TGF-b-1 on the membrane of cancer cells and enhances
responses to both latent and active TGF-b. Carcinogenesis 2011;32:613–21.
The authors regret this error.
