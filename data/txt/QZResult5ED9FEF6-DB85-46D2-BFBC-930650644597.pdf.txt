Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The tumour suppressor ARF is specifically required for p53 activation under oncogenic stress1–6.
Recent studies showed that p53 activation mediated by ARF, but not that induced by DNA
damage, acts as a major protection against tumorigenesis in vivo under certain biological
settings7,8, suggesting that the ARF–p53 axis has more fundamental functions in tumour
suppression than originally thought. Because ARF is a very stable protein in most human cell
lines, it has been widely assumed that ARF induction is mediated mainly at the transcriptional
level and that activation of the ARF–p53 pathway by oncogenes is a much slower and largely
irreversible process by comparison with p53 activation after DNA damage. Here we report that
ARF is very unstable in normal human cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancerous cells.
Through biochemical purification, we identified a specific ubiquitin ligase for ARF and named it
ULF. ULF interacts with ARF both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the lysine-independent
ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF. ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF in normal human cells,
triggering ARF-dependent, p53-mediated growth arrest. Moreover, nucleophosmin (NPM) and cMyc, both of which are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, are capable of abrogating ULFmediated ARF ubiquitylation through distinct mechanisms, and thereby promote ARF stabilization
in cancer cells. These findings reveal the dynamic feature of the ARF–p53 pathway and suggest
that transcription-independent mechanisms are critically involved in ARF regulation during
responses to oncogenic stress.
Although recent studies have demonstrated that ARF turnover can occur through
ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, the identity of the E3 ligase responsible for
ARF degradation and its biological significance are still unknown5,9. In accord with

published results, we found that proteasome-mediated ARF degradation is severely inhibited
in most human tumour cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2). In particular, although the levels of
ARF protein are low in the cells of normal human fibroblast cell lines such as NHF-1,
IMR90 and WI-38 (Fig. 1a), treatment with a proteasome inhibitor markedly stabilized ARF
without affecting the messenger RNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 3) in these cells.
Moreover, the half-life of ARF is extremely short in normal human fibroblasts (less than 30
min) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 4) but increases markedly (to more than 4 h) in the
presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 1c). These data suggest that ARF is very unstable in
normal human cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancerous cells.

Several studies have shown that both the function and stability of ARF are tightly regulated
by NPM (refs 10–17). To elucidate the mechanism of ARF degradation in vivo, we isolated
NPM-associated protein complexes from human cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of the
NPM protein complexes identified one polypeptide with a potential ubiquitin ligase domain
(Supplementary Fig. 5). A fragment of this protein was named as TRIP12 for a binding
partner of the thyroid hormone receptor from a yeast two-hybrid screen with undefined
function18. We have designated this protein as ULF (ubiquitin ligase for ARF) because the
experiments described implicate it in ARF ubiquitylation. In addition to a carboxy-terminal
HECT domain that potentially catalyses ubiquitylation, the 2,025-residue ULF protein also
contains a centrally located WWE motif and an amino-terminal ARM domain (Armadillo/βcatenin-like repeats) (Fig. 1d).
To determine the physiological function of ULF, we examined whether inactivation of
endogenous ULF has any effect on the stability of ARF or NPM. To this end, the normal
human fibroblast cell line NHF-1 was transfected with either a ULF-specific (ULF-RNAi-1)
or a control short interfering RNA (siRNA). As shown in Fig. 1e, the levels of endogenous
ULF polypeptides were severely decreased after three consecutive transfections with ULFRNAi-1. Although the levels of NPM were unaffected by ULF ablation, ULF knockdown
significantly elevated ARF protein levels. As additional controls, the levels of Ink4a/p16 and
c-Myc were not affected by the same treatment. To exclude off-target effects, we also
treated cells with two additional ULF siRNAs (ULF-RNAi-2 and ULF-RNAi-3) that
recognized different regions of the ULF mRNA. Again, the endogenous levels of ARF
protein were increased by ULF knockdown although the mRNA levels for ARF remained
unchanged (Fig. 1f). Similar results were also obtained in other normal human cell lines
such as WI-38 and IMR90 (Supplementary Fig. 6). In addition, the half-life of endogenous
ARF was extended from less than 30 min to about 4 h by knockdown of ULF (Fig. 1g).
These data demonstrate that ULF is required for ARF degradation in normal human cells.

To validate a role for ULF in regulating ARF stability in vivo, we first tested the interaction
between endogenous ARF and ULF proteins. To this end, cell extracts from NHF-1 cells
were immunoprecipitated with anti-ULF or with control IgG. As shown in Fig. 2a, ARF was
detected in the immunoprecipitates obtained with the anti-ULF antiserum but not in those
obtained with control IgG. Conversely, endogenous ULF was readily immunoprecipitated
with an ARF-specific monoclonal antibody but not with control antibody. We also examined
whether ARF can bind ULF in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2b, 35S-labelled ULF strongly bound
immobilized glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged ARF but not GST alone. These data
demonstrate that ULF interacts with ARF both in vitro and in vivo.
To examine the physiological consequence of the ULF–ARF interaction in human cells, we
evaluated the role of ULF in regulating the ARF–p53 pathway. For this purpose, normal
human fibroblast NHF-1 cells were transfected with either control or ULF-specific siRNAs.
As shown in Fig. 2c, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of ULF expression
significantly increased the levels of endogenous p53. To ascertain whether the ULF-

mediated effect on p53 is dependent on ARF, we tested the consequences of ULF
knockdown in the absence of ARF. Indeed, p53 activation was markedly diminished in
NHF-1 cells on siRNA-mediated depletion of both ULF and ARF (Fig. 2c), suggesting that
the activation of p53 induced by ULF ablation is dependent on ARF. To examine whether
ARF induction affects cell growth, we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining of newly
synthesized DNA to monitor cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2d, ULF knockdown
significantly decreased the fraction of BrdU-positive cells (from 54% to 19%), but this
effect was reversed by concomitant knockdown of ARF. Cell proliferation was also visibly
inhibited after similar treatment in ULF-knockdown cells (Fig. 2e). Moreover, analysis by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed that ULF knockdown induces growth arrest by
increasing the proportion of cells in G1 phase (72% versus 55%) and decreasing the
proportion of S-phase cells (14% versus 31%) (Fig. 2f). Again, these effects were reversed
by the concomitant knockdown of either endogenous ARF or p53 (Fig. 2f). These
experiments indicate that inactivation of ULF induces ARF stabilization and triggers an
ARF-dependent, p53-mediated arrest of cell growth.

To examine the functional relationship between ARF and ULF, we tested whether ULF
induces the ubiquitylation of ARF in cells. Western analysis revealed that ARF
ubiquitylation levels were induced in a dosage-dependent manner by ULF expression (Fig.
3a). To validate the importance of its ubiquitin ligase activity, we also made a point mutant
of ULF (ULF-M) in which the conserved cysteine residue in the HECT domain was
replaced by alanine (C1992A). In the same assay, this mutation completely abrogated ARF
ubiquitylation by ULF (Fig. 3a). We also examined whether ULF promotes ARF
ubiquitylation in a purified in vitro system. As shown in Fig. 3b, western blot analysis with
an ARF-specific monoclonal antibody revealed that high levels of ubiquitylated ARF were
generated by wild-type ULF but not by the catalytically inactive ULF-M. Because the
human ARF polypeptide does not contain a lysine residue, these results demonstrate that
ULF is a genuine ubiquitin ligase for lysine-independent ubiquitylation of ARF.

Several recent studies have shown that nucleolar localization of ARF induced by NPM
overexpression is crucial for ARF stabilization9–17,19–21. In particular, whereas NPM levels
are very low in normal human fibroblasts, NPM overexpression occurs in many types of
human cancer (Supplementary Fig. 7; refs 22, 23). As expected, on ectopic expression of
wild-type NPM with ARF in human cells, NPM and ARF were co-localized in the nucleoli
(Supplementary Fig. 8). However, in contrast to ARF, ULF was predominantly present in
the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3c), suggesting that NPM overexpression in cancer cells induces ARF
stabilization by keeping ARF away from its nucleoplasmic ubiquitin ligase. Indeed, ULFdependent polyubiquitylation of ARF was severely inhibited by overexpression of NPM
(Fig. 3d). Moreover, the coding sequences of the NPM gene are mutated in about 35% of
primary acute myeloid leukaemias24–27. These NPM mutants (NPM-c), which failed to
promote ARF retention in the nucleoli (Supplementary Fig. 8), had no obvious effect on
ULF-mediated ubiquitylation of ARF (Fig. 3d).
To validate NPM-mediated effects on the ULF–ARF interaction in vivo, we examined
whether NPM knockdown restores the ULF-dependent degradation of ARF in cancer cells.
To this end, H1299 carcinoma cells were transfected with a NPM-specific siRNA (NPMRNAi), a ULF-specific siRNA (ULF-RNAi), or a control siRNA (control RNAi). As
expected, ARF was very stable in H1299 cells and the levels of ARF were not markedly
affected by ULF depletion (data not shown). However, RNAi-mediated knockdown of NPM
expression significantly decreased the levels of endogenous ARF (Fig. 3e). In particular, this
effect was completely reversed by the concomitant knockdown of ULF (Fig. 3e). To
corroborate these results, we also examined the half-life of ARF protein under different
treatments. The long half-life of endogenous ARF in H1299 cells was decreased to less than

30 min by NPM depletion but was restored when both NPM and ULF were depleted (Fig.
3f). To demonstrate more rigorously the specificity of these effects, we included rescue
controls for the RNAi depletion experiments. Thus, expression vectors encoding either wildtype ULF or catalytically inactive ULF-C1992A (ULF-M) were designed with a point
mutation at the RNAi-1 targeting region to render them resistant to RNAi-1-mediated
depletion (Supplementary Fig. 9). We then examined whether RNAi-resistant ULF(R) could
restore ARF degradation in H1299 cells simultaneously depleted with NPM-RNAi and
ULF-RNAi-1. Expression of RNAi-resistant wild-type ULF, but not C1992A-mutant ULF,
significantly decreased the levels of ARF protein in these cells (Fig. 3g), indicating that the
ubiquitin ligase activity is required for ULF-mediated ARF degradation. These data show
that ULF induces the ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF but this activity is inhibited in
these cancer cells because ULF and ARF exist mostly in different subcellular compartments.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Numerous studies indicate that ARF function is markedly induced by oncogenic stress4–7.
Although the mRNA levels for ARF are up-regulated in cancer cells, the ARF protein is also
stabilized in most human tumour cells. Western analysis revealed that a significant amount
of endogenous c-Myc, but not Ras or E2F1, was also co-purified with the ULF-associated
complexes (Fig. 4a). We further confirmed that ULF interacts with c-Myc both in vitro and
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 10). We next examined whether ULF-mediated ARF
ubiquitylation is modulated by c-Myc expression. As shown in Fig. 4b, c-Myc expression
markedly decreased ULF-dependent ubiquitylation of ARF, although a mutant Myc(1–328),
lacking the ULF-binding domain (Supplementary Fig. 11), failed to do so. Thus, binding
between c-Myc and ULF is required for the Myc-mediated effect on ARF ubiquitylation. To
investigate further this novel aspect function of c-Myc on ARF, we made a transcriptionally
defective c-Myc mutant (Myc-ΔBR) that lacks the basic region required for DNA binding
but retains its ability to interact with ULF (Supplementary Fig. 12). Myc-ΔBR suppressed
ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitylation to the same extent as wild-type c-Myc (Fig. 4b), and the
interaction between ARF and ULF was inhibited by expression of either wild-type Myc or
Myc-ΔBR (Fig. 4c).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, to examine the transcription-independent effects of c-Myc on ARF induction under
more physiological settings, we tested whether Myc-ΔBR expression was sufficient to
activate the ARF–p53 pathway in normal human cells. Western analysis of the cell extracts
revealed that Myc-ΔBR expression increased the steady-state levels of endogenous ARF in
normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 4d). As expected, expression of the transcription-defective
Myc-ΔBR had no obvious effect on the levels of ARF mRNA (Fig. 4e) but significantly
extended the half-life of ARF polypeptides (Fig. 4f). Moreover, Myc-ΔBR expression
stabilized p53 and induced p21 expression (Fig. 4d); conversely, Ink4a/p16 levels were not
altered by Myc-ΔBR. These data show that c-Myc can stabilize ARF by inhibiting the ULF–
ARF interaction and that c-Myc-mediated ARF induction is achieved, at least in part,
through a transcription-independent mechanism.
ULF probably serves in normal cells as a sensor of oncogenic stress that represses ARF/p53
function in unstressed cells but permits transcription-independent induction of the ARF/p53
pathway in cells at risk of malignant transformation. Obviously, downstream lesions in the
p53 pathway, such as p53 mutation and Mdm2 amplification, would impair p53
activation1–6. ULF itself is highly expressed in human tumours, including breast cancer and
pancreatic cancer, on the basis of the cancer gene expression profile database from
Oncomine Research28,29 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Mechanistically, our findings add a
dynamic feature to the ARF regulatory pathway. On damage to DNA, ubiquitylation of p53
is inhibited by post-translational mechanisms that permit the immediate stabilization and
activation of p53 (refs 4, 6). the activation of p53 by genotoxic stress is therefore a rapid
process that prevents the further proliferation of cells bearing damaged DNA. In contrast,

ARF induction was thought to be a much slower and largely irreversible process that may
require epigenetic changes of the ARF gene locus1–6. Our findings significantly modify the
current view of ARF regulation by showing that ARF can be activated through a very rapid
and potentially reversible process involving ULF-mediated ubiquitylation, reminiscent of
the interaction between p53 and Mdm2. We propose that activation of p53 by ARF,
representing a critical barrier for oncogenesis30, requires both transcription-independent
(fast) and transcription-dependent (slow) upregulation of ARF for effectively suppressing
tumorigenesis in vivo.

H1299, U2OS, 293 and U-937 cells were maintained in DMEM medium; NHF-1, IMR-90
and WI-38 cells in MEM medium; SK-BR-3 cells in McCoy’s 5A medium; and BT-549
cells in RPMI medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Purification of NPM complexes from human cells
The epitope-tagging strategy to isolate NPM-containing protein complexes from human

were detected by western blot analysis. The stable cell lines were chosen to expand for
complex purification. Thus, the cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum

were left to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 10% Nonidet P40 (Fluka) was added to a
final concentration of 0.5%. The tube was vigorously vortex-mixed for 1 min. The
homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000g. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in
ice-cold buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM
PMSF and protein inhibitor mixture) and the tube was rocked vigorously at 4 °C for 45 min.
The nuclear extract was diluted with buffer D (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA) to a
final NaCl concentration of 100 mM, ultracentrifuged at 69,300g for 2 h at 4 °C. After
filtration with 0.45-μm syringe filters (Nalgene), the supernatants were used as nuclear
extracts for M2 immunoprecipitations by anti-Flag-antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma).
The bound polypeptides were eluted with the Flag peptide and were further affinity-purified
by anti-HA-antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma). The final eluates from the HA beads with
HA peptides were resolved by SDS–PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel (Novex) for silver
staining or staining analysis with colloidal blue. Specific bands were cut out from the gel
and subjected to mass-spectrometric peptide sequencing. GST pull-down. GST–Myc, GST–
ARF and GST–NPM were induced in Rosetta (DE3) pLys cells (Novagen) at room
temperature (25 °C), extracted with buffer BC500 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 0.2 mM EDTA,
500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF) containing 1% Nonidet P40, and
purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia). pcDNA3.1-ULF full-length or different
deletion mutants were labelled by incorporation of 35S-methionine during in vitro translation
(TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System; Promega Corporation). 35S-labelled protein (5
μl) was incubated overnight with 3 μg of the purified GST–NPM, GST–Myc or GST–ARF
proteins, as indicated, in the presence of 0.2% BSA in BC200 on a rotator at 4 °C. The
proteins were pulled down with GST beads; the beads were washed three times with BC200
and twice with BC100. The beads were added to 40 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer and boiled
for 5 min. The presence of 35S-labelled protein was detected by autoradiography.
siRNA-mediated ablation of ULF, ARF, NPM and p53

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ablation of ULF was performed by transfection of the NHF-1 cells or the other cell lines
with siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (ULF-RNAi-1 (5′GGUAGUGACUCCACCCAUUUU-3′), ULF-RNAi-2(5′GAACACAGAUGGUGCGAUAUU-3′),ULF-RNAi-3(5′GACAAAGACUCAUACAAUAUU-3′) or ULF-RNAi-1 mutant (5′GGUCGUGACUCCACUCAUUUU-3′)) synthesized by Dharmacon. NPM RNAi (OnTarget-Plus Smartpool L-015737-00; Dharmacon), p14ARF RNAi (5′GAUCAUCAGUCACCGAAGGUU-3′; Dharmacon), p53 RNAi (On-Target-plus
Smartpool L-003329-00; Dharmacon) and control RNAi (On-target-plus siControl nontargeting-pool D-001810-10-20; Dharmacon) were also used for transfection. RNAi
transfections were performed three times at 24–48-h intervals, with Lipofectamine 2000 or
Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.
Adenovirus infection
Adenoviruses expressing Myc or c-Myc-ΔBR were produced by using the AdEasy
Adenoviral Vector System kit from Stratagene in accordance with the manufacturer’s
manual. To construct adenovirus-Myc or c-Myc-ΔBR, the cDNAs were first cloned into
pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1 vector. The resultant plasmids were then transformed for
recombination into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 containing the adenoviral backbone
plasmid pAdEasy-1. The roughly 40-kilobase recombinant plasmids were linearized by
digestion with PacI and purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform. AD-293 cells were
then transfected with the purified DNA to produce adenoviruses expressing Myc or c-MycΔBR. After one round of amplification in Ad-293 cells, the viruses were used to infect
NHF-1 cells at 70% confluence.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To prepare the purified components for the in vitro ubiquitylation assay, pet14b-ARF–HA
was induced in Rosetta (DE3) pLys cells (Novagen) at room temperature, and proteins were
extracted with buffer BC300 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 0.2 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF) containing 1% Nonidet P40, and purified on HA
beads (Sigma). E3 (Flag–HA–ULF) was purified from H1299 stable cell line with M2 beads
in BC300 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 0.2 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5%
Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF). Rabbit E1 was obtained from Calbiochem.
Rabbit E2 and His-ubiquitin were purchased as a purified protein from Affinity Inc.
In vitro ubiquitylation assays
The in vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed as described previously with some
modifications14. ARF–HA protein (5 ng) produced by bacteria was mixed with other
components, including E1 (10 ng) or E2 (His-UbcH5a, 100 ng), and 5 μg of His-ubiquitin
(affinity) and E3 (purified from H1299 cells stably transfected with Flag–HA–ULF or Flag–
HA–ULF-M) in 10 μl of reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
ATP, 2 mM DTT). The reaction was stopped after 3 h at 37 °C by the addition of SDS
sample buffer, and subsequently resolved on SDS–PAGE gels for western blot analysis with
anti-ARF antibody, and ULF or ULF-M levels with anti-HA antibody.

In vivo ubiquitylation assays
The in vivo ubiquitylation assay was performed as reported previously, with some
modifications14. In brief, 293 cells were co-transfected by using the calcium phosphate
method with expression vectors of ARF, HA–ubiquitin, ULF or ULF-M (C1992A), as
indicated. Cells were harvested after 24 h and lysed in RIPA buffer with 0.05% SDS
containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were precleared with rabbit IgG and protein A/G
beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, and precleared supernatants were precipitated
with rabbit anti-ARF antibody ab-4 (Labvision) or NB200-111 (Novus Biologicals).
Immune complexes recovered with protein A/G beads were washed six times with RIPA
buffer and boiled in 2 × sample buffer for 5 min. Denatured immune complexes were
resolved on an SDS gel. Proteins were detected with antibodies against HA (rat) and ARF
(either monoclonal or rabbit). Ectopic protein levels in crude lysates were analysed by
western blotting with anti-V5 antibody for ULF, or with anti-Myc (N-262) for Myc, MycΔBR or Myc(1–328).

BrdU labelling. The BrdU incorporation assay was performed essentially as described
previously14. In brief, cells were grown in medium containing 20 μM BrdU (Calbiochem)
for 2 h and then fixed in 70% ethanol. DNA was denatured, and cells were permeabilized in
2 M HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), neutralized in 0.1 M Na2B4O7 pH 8.5, and then
blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Anti-BrdU (Amersham) was added in accordance with the
manufacture’s protocol. After being washed with 1% BSA/PBS, the cells were incubated
with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Finally, cells were
counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to reveal the nuclei.
RT–PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and first-strand

For immunofluorescent staining, the cells were plated on six-well glass coverslips. Cells on
the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then fixed for 20 min with 4%
paraformaldehyde on ice, rehydrated for 5 min in serum-free DMEM, and permeabilized for
10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fisher). Cells were incubated for 30 min in 1% BSA
(Sigma)/PBS (Cellgro). Primary rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche) (for transfected
FH-ULF immunostaining) or polyclonal ARF (ab-4, for endogenous ARF immunostaining)
was added to 1% BSA/PBS for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with 1% BSA/
PBS, Alexa-conjugated anti-rat, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody was added and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were counterstained with DAPI to reveal the
nuclei, essentially as described previously32.

a, ARF is ubiquitylated by ULF in vivo. Lysates from transfected 293 cells were
immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-ARF antibody (ab-4), and separated proteins were blotted
with antibodies against the HA (top) or monoclonal ARF (middle) antibody. Ectopic ULF in
crude lysates were analysed by western blotting (WB) with anti-V5 antibody. b, ARF is
ubiquitylated by ULF in vitro. See Methods for detail. c, Subcellular localization of ectopic
ULF and endogenous ARF in H1299 cells. d, ARF ubiquitylation mediated by ULF is
