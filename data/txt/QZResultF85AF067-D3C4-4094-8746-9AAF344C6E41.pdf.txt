Abstract
The E7 oncoprotein of the high-risk human papillomaviruses
(HPV) is thought to contribute to cervical carcinogenesis at
least in part by abrogating cell cycle regulation. E7 can
dysregulate the cell cycle through its interaction with several
cellular proteins including the retinoblastoma suppressor
protein pRb, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p21Cip1. Inactivation of pRb in cervical epithelia is not
sufficient to explain the ability of E7 to cause cervical cancers
in transgenic mice. In the current study, we focused on the
role of p21Cip1 in cervical cancer. Cervical disease was
significantly increased in p21/ mice compared with p21+/+
mice, showing that p21Cip1 can function as a tumor suppressor
in this tissue. Importantly, the ability of E7 to induce cervical
cancers was not significantly enhanced on the p21-null
background, consistent with the hypothesis that the ability
of E7 to inhibit p21Cip1 contributes to its carcinogenic
properties. Further supportive of this hypothesis, cervical
carcinogenesis in mice expressing a mutant form of HPV-16
E7, E7CVQ, which fails to inactivate p21Cip1, was significantly
reduced compared with that in K14E7WT mice expressing
wild-type HPV-16 E7. However, K14E7CVQ mice still displayed
heightened levels of cervical carcinogenesis compared with
that in nontransgenic mice, indicating that activities of E7
besides its capacity to inactivate p21Cip1 also contribute to
cervical carcinogenesis. Taken together, we conclude that
p21Cip1 functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis and that p21Cip1 inactivation by HPV-16 E7 partially
contributes to the contribution of E7 to cervical carcinogenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5656–63]

Introduction
Among the mucosotropic human papillomaviruses (HPV), a
subset, called the high-risk HPVs, is the major causative factor in
cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women
worldwide (1). Of these high-risk HPVs, HPV-16 is the most
common, being found in 60% for all cervical cancers (2). High-risk
HPVs encode three oncogenes, E5, E6, and E7, which independently
and synergistically transform and/or immortalize murine fibroblasts and/or human keratinocytes in tissue culture (3–5) and
induce skin cancers in mice (6–9). Based on studies in mouse
models, E7 appears to be the most potent of these three oncogenes

in inducing cervical carcinogenesis (10).1 This study focuses on the
carcinogenic properties of E7 in the cervix.
HPV-16 E7 is a multifunctional protein with potent transforming
and oncogenic properties that is capable of overriding the normal
differentiation process and disrupting cell cycle regulation (11).
HPV-16 E7 is able to dysregulate the cell cycle by binding to several
cellular proteins, including the pocket protein family members,
pRb, p107, and p130 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Of these, the best-characterized cellular target
is retinoblastoma tumor suppressor or pRb (12). pRb, when bound
by E7, is dissociated from E2Fs and degraded by the proteasome
(3, 13). As a result, the functions of pRb in cell cycle regulation are
disrupted by E7 (11, 14). Although these data support the
hypothesis that pRb inactivation could account for the ability of
E7 to transform/immortalize cells in tissue culture and cause
cancer in vivo, we recently learned that pRb inactivation is not
sufficient to explain the abilities of E7 to cause cervical dysplasia or
invasive cervical cancer, although pRb inactivation by E7 is
necessary for the induction of cervical dysplasia (15). Thus, the
non-pRb target(s) of E7 is likely important for the contribution of
E7 to cervical carcinogenesis.
The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 is another
cellular target of HPV-16 E7 (16, 17). Induction/overexpression of
p21Cip1 results in the inhibition of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes that
are involved in the phosphorylation of pocket family proteins (18).
This growth-arresting activity of p21Cip1 correlates with its
induction during growth arrest by transforming growth factor-h,
cell differentiation, and in senescent cells (19, 20). In humans, loss
of p21Cip1 expression correlates with breast cancer and oral/
esophageal cancers (21–23). In mouse model studies, p21/ mice
have an increased incidence of spontaneous tumors compared with
p21-sufficient mice (24) and an increased susceptibility to
chemically induced skin carcinogenesis (25, 26). Thus, p21Cip1 is
considered to be a tumor suppressor. In addition, p21Cip1 is
inhibited by E7 despite that the expression level of p21 is upregulated in E7-expressing cells. HPV-16 E7 can bind to and
inactivate the function of p21 to inhibit CDK2 in human
keratinocytes (17) and block proliferating cell nuclear antigendependent DNA replication in vitro (16). These results implicate
p21Cip1 as a relevant target of E7 in its role in HPV-associated
carcinogenesis.
In this study, we investigated the role of p21Cip1 in cervical
carcinogenesis and examined the importance of p21Cip1 as a target
of HPV-16 E7 in cervical cancer using mouse models. Our
observations indicate that p21Cip1 has a tumor-suppressive activity
in cervical carcinogenesis and that E7 overrides the tumorsuppressive function of p21Cip1; however, the inactivation of
p21Cip1 alone is not sufficient to explain fully the oncogenic

potential of HPV-16 E7. These data are consistent with p21Cip1
being an important target for E7 in carcinogenesis and for E7 being
a multifunctional oncogene.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice. K14E7WT mice (maintained on the inbred FVB/N
genetic background), which have been described previously (7), were
crossed to p21/ mice (on a mixed 129/C57 genetic background) and
K14E7p21+/ offspring and then crossed to p21+/ mice to generate
p21+/+, p21/, K14E7p21+/+ , K14E7p21/ mice used in this study.
K14E7CVQ68-70AAA (K14E7CVQ ) transgenic mice were generated by mutating
amino acids 68 to 70. The K14E7CVQ transgene cassette was excised,
purified, and microinjected into FVB/N 1-day-old embryos, which were then
implanted into pseudo-pregnant female mice. Founder mice and their
offspring were screened by PCR and Southern blot to identify lines with
single, stable transgene integration sites. K14E7CVQ mice were maintained
on the inbred FVB/N genetic background and compared with K14E7WT
transgenic mice maintained on the same genetic background. All mice were
bred and maintained in the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care-approved McArdle Laboratory Cancer Center
Animal Care Facility and were managed in accordance with an approved
animal protocol.
Estrogen treatment and cervical carcinogenesis. All studies were
done with female mice treated with exogenous estrogen pellets (17hestradiol 0.05 mg, 60-day release pellets) as described previously (10).
Treatment was initiated at age 6 weeks. For acute studies, mice were treated
for just 6 weeks. For cervical cancer studies, all mice treated with estrogen
for 6 months, and mice were sacrificed and the reproductive tracts were
harvested. These reproductive tissues were fixed and sectioned as described
previously (10). Every tenth 5 Am section was stained with H&E and
evaluated histopathologically. For the diagnosis of cervix disease, each
mouse was scored blindly for the worst cervical lesion detected in cervix
and vagina.
Statistical analysis. The MSTAT software program2 was used for
determining statistical significance. A two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used
to determine the significance for cancer incidence between each mice
group. To determine the significance for the tumor multiplicity, tumor size,
and disease state, a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used.
E7 Western blot. Mice were treated with estrogen for 6 weeks as
described above. Mice were sacrificed, the lower reproductive tract was
isolated, and it was homogenized in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, sonicated briefly, agitated
30 min at 4jC, and spun 20 min at full speed in a microfuge. Supernatant
was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the

Bradford assay. Samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed for E7 with a mixture of
antibodies (1:150; Zymed and 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Band
intensities were quantified using NIH ImageJ software.
Immunohistochemistry. Quantification of DNA synthesis and immunohistochemistry were done as described previously (10, 15, 27). Briefly,
anti-p21 (1:25 in 5% nonfat milk/5% horse serum; BD Pharmingen),
anti-pRb (1:50 BD in 5% horse serum; BD Pharmingen), anti-Mcm7 (1:200 in
5% horse serum; LabVision Neomarkers), anti-phospho-CDK2 (1:20 in 4%
horse serum; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p16 (1:50 in 5% nonfat milk/
5% horse serum; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd; 1:50 in 5% horse serum; Calbiochem), anti-CDK2 (1:20 in 4%
horse serum; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p130 (1:450 in 0.1% PBSTween 20 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin; AnaSpec), and anti-p107 (1:125
in 0.1% PBS-Tween 20 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were used for immunohistochemistry in these studies [for
the latter case, mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (10 AL/g
body weight of 12.5 mg/mL solution) 1 h before sacrifice].

Results
p21 expression level is induced by HPV-16 E7 in murine
cervix. The levels of expression of p21 are known to be upregulated in HPV-16 E7-expressing human keratinocytes (16, 17)
as well as in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
squamous epithelium of human (28), and this appears to be
mediated by the inactivation of pRb by E7 (29). To examine
whether p21 expression is increased by HPV-16 E7 in the murine
cervix, we performed p21 immunohistochemical staining on the
cervical epithelium from nontransgenic and K14E7 transgenic
mice (Fig. 1). The level of expression of p21 was significantly
increased in the stratified epithelium of the K14E7 mice
compared with that of the nontransgenic mice. This induction
was most evident in the suprabasal compartment of the stratified
epithelium of the cervix, much like what was observed in the skin
of these mice (29), and in the raft cultures of E7-positive human
keratinocytes (16, 30). In addition, we confirmed (data not shown)
that p21 was induced in HPV-positive human cervix tissues both
in CIN lesions and in squamous cervical carcinoma (28, 31).
These data show that HPV-16 E7 induces p21 expression in the
cervix of transgenic mice as is apparent in the cervix of
HPV-positive lesions in women.
p21 functions as a tumor suppressor in the mouse cervix,
but its tumor-suppressive activity is suppressed by HPV-16 E7.
It previously has been shown that p21 functions as a tumor
suppressor in skin carcinogenesis (25, 26). We wanted to
determine whether p21 has a tumor-suppressive effect on cervical

carcinogenesis, especially in light of the fact that E7 is known to
inactivate p21 function. To address this question, we evaluated
the incidence of cervical cancer and precancerous cervical lesions
in p21/, p21+/+, K14E7p21/ , and K14E7p21+/+ mice treated
with exogenous estrogen for 6 months. Estrogen has been shown
to be a critical cofactor in HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis
in mouse models (10, 32).
As predicted based on prior studies (10), p21+/+ mice did not
develop high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer (Table 1).
In contrast, a subset of p21/ mice developed CIN3, carcinoma
in situ (CIS), or cervical cancer (Table 1). This increase in cervical
disease in the p21/ mice compared with p21+/+ mice was significant (P = 0.05), consistent with p21 functioning as a tumor suppressor
in this tissue. Given this finding, it was notable that the incidence of
cervical disease in the K14E7p21/ was not significantly higher
than that observed in theK14E7p21+/+ mice (P = 0.3). These data are
consistent with the hypothesis that E7 overcomes the tumorsuppressive effect of p21. Also of note, the p21/ mice had a
reduced incidence of cervical disease compared with that observed
in the K14E7p21/ mice (P = 0.06), consistent with the hypothesis
that E7 possesses oncogenic activities in addition to its ability to
suppress the tumor-suppressive activities of p21.
Generation of a transgenic mouse expressing a form of
HPV-16 E7 unable to inactivate p21. The above-described data
are consistent with HPV-16 E7 directly suppressing the tumorsuppressive activity of p21; however, it is also possible that HPV-16
E7 is overriding the function of p21 via the ability of E7 to
inactivate pRb and the other pocket proteins, the phosphorylation
of which is normally regulated by p21. To distinguish between these
two hypotheses, we generated transgenic mice expressing the
HPV-16 E7CVQ68-70AAA mutant (hereafter called E7CVQ , consistent
with prior literature), which in tissue culture is able to bind and
destabilize pRb, p107, and p130 as efficiently as wild-type HPV-16
E7 but is deficient in its ability to inactivate p21 (33, 34). E7CVQ
contains alanine substituted at amino acid positions 68 to 70 in
HPV-16 E7 in place of cysteine, valine, and glutamine residues,
respectively. We identified a line of K14E7CVQ transgenic mice (line
204) expressing the HPV-16 E7CVQ mutant protein at levels similar
to the levels of expression of wild-type HPV-16 E7 protein found in
our reference K14E7WT mouse line (line 2304) used in our prior and
current cervical carcinogenesis studies (Fig. 2A and B). The
K14E7CVQ mice displayed overt phenotypes, including wrinkled

skin, ruffled fur, and cataracts, similar to that observed in K14E7WT
mice (data not shown).
Ability of HPV-16 E7 to inactivate p21 partially contributes
to hyperplasia in the cervical stratified epithelium. A property
of E7 is its ability to induce epidermal hyperplasia manifest in its
induction of DNA synthesis within suprabasal compartment (35).
E7 can induce suprabasal DNA synthesis, for which the inactivation
of pRb is necessary but not sufficient (15). To determine if the
inactivation of p21 by E7 affects suprabasal DNA synthesis, we
examined the frequency of BrdUrd-positive cells in cervical
stratified epithelium of 6-week-old (sexually mature) female mice
that were treated with estrogen for either a short period (6 weeks),
which is sufficient to place the mice in estrus (data not shown), or
6 months, the treatment period used in our cervical cancer studies.
DNA synthesis within suprabasal layers in 6-week estrogen-treated
K14E7CVQ mice was not significantly different compared with that
in K14E7WT mice (Fig. 2C) but was significantly lower among the
K14E7CVQ mice compared with K14E7WT mice treated for 6 months
with estrogen (P = 0.05; Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the
inactivation of p21 by E7 contributes to suprabasal DNA synthesis
in the presence of exogenous estrogen, but this is only observed in
older female mice that have undergone estrogen treatment for
6 months, the treatment period used in our cervical cancer studies.
One possible explanation is that there is selection for cells that
spend more time in S phase or less time in the other parts of the
cell cycle in these mice.
HPV-16 E7CVQ is able to inactivate pRb but unable to
inactivate p21 function in the stratified epithelium in murine
cervix. To examine whether HPV-16 E7CVQ mutant is able to bind
and target pRb for degradation in our transgenic mice, we
performed pRb immunohistochemistry. Both wild-type E7 and
E7CVQ mutant proteins were able to cause decreased steady-state
levels of pRb (Fig. 3A) as well as the other two pocket proteins p107
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) and p130 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Not
surprisingly, we also could not detect phospho-pRb (S807/S811) in
the cervical epithelium of either K14E7WT or K14E7CVQ mice (data
not shown). These data are consistent with tissue culture-based
studies, indicating that this mutant retains the ability of wild-type
E7 to bind and degrade the human pocket proteins (33, 34). The
ability of E7 to induce the expression of the E2F-responsive gene
Mcm7 is largely the consequence of its inactivation of pRb (15).
Therefore, the induction of MCM7 can be used as a marker to
assess the ability of E7 to inactivate pRb. Consistent with the ability

of E7CVQ mutant to cause a decreased steady-state level of pRb
(Fig. 3A), we observed an induction in the levels of MCM7 in
K14E7CVQ mice similar to that in K14E7WT mice (Fig. 3B). The only
difference in the MCM7 expression pattern between K14E7WT and
K14E7CVQ mice was the intensity of staining in the topmost
epithelial cell layers, wherein the high induction of MCM7 was
absent in the mutant E7-expressing tissue. Interestingly, we
previously observed the similar pattern of MCM7 expression in
cervix of K14creRb f/f mice, which is conditionally deleted Rb (15).
This could indicate some importance of the inactivation of p21 in
permitting for the continued high-level expression of MCM7 in
terminally differentiated cells.
We next examined whether K14E7CVQ mice have a deficiency in
their ability to inactivate p21 in stratified epithelia of female
reproductive tract. In previous studies, it has been shown that p21
activity is associated with dephosphorylation of CDK2 (36) and also
reported that p21 blocks the phosphorylation of CDK2 by CDKactivating kinase (36, 37). Thus, we looked at phospho-CDK2
expression in the epithelia of reproductive tract in p21/ and
p21+/+ mice to confirm whether phospho-CDK2 expression is
regulated by p21 function in vivo. As expected, phospho-CDK2
expression is up-regulated in p21/ mice compared with 21+/+
mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we evaluated both total CDK2
and phospho-CDK2 expression in the epithelia of reproductive
tract in nontransgenic mice, K14E7CVQ and K14E7WT mice. Whereas
total CDK2 was present in all three genotypes (Fig. 3C), phosphoCDK2 was only evident in the cervical epithelium of K14E7WT mice,
not that of either nontransgenic or K14E7CVQ mice (Fig. 3D). This is
consistent with the previous findings by Helt and Galloway that the
HPV-16 E7CVQ mutant is deficient in inactivating p21 (33, 34).
HPV-16 E7CVQ mutant that is deficient in its ability to
inactivate p21 has a lower incidence of cancer in murine

to cervical carcinogenesis, we evaluated the incidence of cervical
cancer in K14E7CVQ and K14E7WT mice when treated with
exogenous estrogen pellet for 6 months. Consistent with our
previous study (10), all K14E7WT mice developed high-grade
cervical dysplasia and/or invasive cervical cancer (Table 2). In
contrast, K14E7CVQ mice displayed a significantly reduced incidence of frank cancer compared with K14E7WT mice (P = 0.008;
Table 2). Tumor multiplicity in K14E7CVQ mice was also reduced
(P = 0.001) compared with that in K14E7WT mice (Table 2). The
mean size of the cancers (mean cross-sectional area) was
significantly smaller (P = 0.0012) in the K14E7 CVQ mice
(0.39 mm2) compared with the K14E7WT mice (2.55 mm2);
correspondingly, K14E7CVQ mice also had a significantly lower
incidence of large invasive cancers when compared with K14E7WT
mice (P = 0.004; Table 2). In addition, we observed less severe
overall disease in K14E7CVQ mice compared with that in K14E7WT
mice (P = 0.001; here, we compared the worst grade of disease
among each cohort of mice). All of these results together indicate
that the ability of E7 to inactivate p21 correlates with its oncogenic
properties.
Our data also support the conclusion that the inactivation of p21
alone is insufficient to fully account for the oncogenic potential of
E7, as K14E7CVQ mice displayed a significant increase in overall
cervical disease (P = 0.000001) and a marginally significant increase
in cancer incidence (P = 0.07) compared with nontransgenic mice.
We conclude that the inactivation of p21 by E7 contributes to, but
alone is insufficient to account fully for, the role of E7 in cervical
carcinogenesis.

cancer similar to that observed in HPV-16 E7WT –induced

biomarkers for HPV-associated cervical cancer in humans and

mice (27, 38), and their induction correlates strongly with the
expression of E7 (27). We therefore compared the expression
patterns of these same two biomarkers in the cancers arising in the
K14E7CVQ and K14E7WT mice. Similar to the prior analysis of
cervical epithelia (Fig. 3), MCM7 expression was induced in the
tumors arising in K14E7CVQ mice much like that in tumors from
K14E7WT mice (Fig. 4A). Likewise, we saw heightened levels of p16
in tumors from mutant E7 transgenic mice (Fig. 4B), although it
was slightly reduced compared with tumors in wild-type E7
transgenic mice.

Discussion
p21 is a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer. In mice treated
with estrogen for 6 months, we observed that some of p21/ mice
developed cervical cancer in contrast to none of p21+/+ mice

(Table 1). Furthermore, disease progression in the cervix was
significantly increased in p21/ mice (Table 1). These results are
consistent with studies on chemically induced skin carcinogenesis
in which p21 was found to function as a tumor suppressor in the
epidermis (25, 26). However, we also found that the disruption of
the tumor-suppressive activity of p21 alone is not sufficient to
account fully for cervical carcinogenesis induced by HPV-16 E7,
because K14E7p21/ mice had a significantly higher incidence of
cervical disease compared with p21/ mice (Table 1). That we
observed that the tumor-suppressive activity of p21 was not
effective in the context of E7-expressing mice (K14E7p21+/+ versus
K14E7p21/ mice; Table 1) is consistent with the hypothesis that
E7 inactivates the tumor-suppressive activity of p21 (16, 17).
In a prior study, pRb inactivation together with exogenous
estrogen treatment was found to be insufficient to cause the
development of high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer

(15). One possible explanation for this finding is that inactivation of
multiple pocket proteins (e.g., pRb, p107, and p130), all of which are
normally targeted by E7, are necessary for tumorigenesis in the
cervix, and studies are under way to test this possibility. In
contrast, p21 inactivation together with exogenous estrogen
treatment was sufficient to cause the development of high-grade
cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer, albeit at lower penetrance
compared with that in E7 transgenic mice. This observation and
the fact that E7 could override the tumor-suppressive activity of
p21 indicate that p21 is a critical but certainly not the sole target
for E7.
Characterization of the phenotype of HPV-16 E7CVQ mutant
in the cervical stratified epithelium of transgenic mice.
In previous studies in human foreskin keratinocytes, HPV-16
E7CVQ mutant was shown to destabilize pRb and its related
pocket proteins as efficiently as wild-type E7 while being defective
for its ability to inactivate p21 (33, 34). A recent study has shown
that the cullin-2 ubiquitin-ligase complex contributes to HPV-16
E7-mediated pRb destabilization and that the E7CVQ mutant was
reduced in its association with the cullin-2 ubiquitin-ligase
complex (39). In our study, the E7CVQ mutant retained the ability
to cause decreased steady-state levels of pRb (Fig. 3A ).
Furthermore, the heightened level of MCM7 expression, which
is known to correlate with pRb inactivation, was not greatly
different between wild-type E7 and E7CVQ mutant-expressing
mouse tissues (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that E7CVQ mutant is able to efficiently degrade pRb
and supports the hypothesis that an additional E7-associated
ubiquitin ligase(s) contributes to HPV-16 E7-mediated pRb
degradation or that the E7CVQ protein retains sufficient ability
to bind cullin-2 to allow it to effectively degrade pRb.
The relationship between E7 and p21 is paradoxical. On one
hand, E7 causes an increased level of p21 in human and mouse
cells/tissues (16, 29, 30). On the other hand, E7 can inactivate p21
(16, 17). In our study, we observed that the ability of E7CVQ to
inactivate p21 was compromised based on the fact that the
activated form of CDK2, phospho-CDK2, was not induced in
K14E7CVQ mouse tissues, in contrast to what we observed in
K14E7WT tissues. This observation in mouse tissues is consistent
with the prior observation that E7CVQ is defective for its ability to
inactivate p21 in human cells (33). However, we still noted an
increase in the steady-state levels of p21 in K14E7CVQ mouse
tissues. This indicates that the induction of p21 by E7 is separable

www.aacrjournals.org

from the ability of E7 to inactivate p21. This finding is consistent
with the hypothesis (29) that the induction of p21 by E7 is a
consequence of the ability of E7 to inactivate pRb, an activity that
is retained by the E7CVQ mutant (Fig. 1).
Oncogenic potential of HPV-16 E7CVQ mutant in cervical
carcinogenesis. By using p21-null mice, we observed a tumorsuppressive activity of p21 in cervical carcinogenesis. Thus, we
investigated the importance of the inactivation of p21 by E7 in
cervical carcinogenesis by performing a phenotypic comparison
between K14E7WT and K14E7CVQ mice. In K14E7WT mice treated
with estrogen for 6 months, all of K14E7WT mice developed highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesions as described previously (10).
K14E7CVQ mice showed a significant reduction in the incidence of
both cervical cancer and disease progression compared with that
in K14E7WT mice (Table 2). Furthermore, tumor multiplicity in
K14E7CVQ mice was also reduced compared with that in K14E7WT
mice (Table 2) and the mean size of the cancers was significantly
smaller in the K14E7CVQ mice compared with the K14E7WT mice.
These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the

ability of E7 to inactivate p21 contributes to its oncogenic
potential.
Although our data with the K14E7CVQ mouse tissues are
consistent with a role of the inactivation of E7 of p21 contributing
to cervical carcinogenesis, other interpretations cannot be
discounted. For instance, wild-type E7 is known also to inhibit
another CDK inhibitor that inhibits CDK2 activity, p27 (40). It is not
known whether the CVQ mutant retains the ability to inhibit p27.3
Also, E7 can directly interact with CDK2 and this could lead to the
modulation by E7 of the activity of this kinase (41). It is not known
whether the CVQ mutation alters the direct interaction of E7 with
CDK2. Regardless, our results indicate that an alteration in the
activity of CDK2 by E7, whether by its inhibition of p21 and p27
and/or its direct modulation of CDK2, correlates with its role in
cervical carcinogenesis.
Another interesting finding is that cervical disease and incidence
of cancer in K14E7CVQ mice was significantly higher than in
nontransgenic mice. These data support the hypothesis that other
activities of E7 also contribute to cervical carcinogenesis. Current
studies are attempting to determine if these other activities include
the abilities of E7 to inactivate multiple pocket proteins.
Molecular function of p21 on cervical carcinogenesis.
Previous studies have shown that p21 both inhibits CDKs (18)
and regulates proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA
replication (42, 43). The CDK2-inhibitory activity of p21 correlates
with Rb-dependent E2F transcription regulation (44). In the current
study, we observed that expression of Mcm7, an E2F-responsive
gene, was induced in cervical epithelium of p21/ mice,
consistent with the hypothesis that p21 indirectly regulates E2F
activity, but this induction was less than that seen in K14E7WT
mice. Given that E7 not only inactivates p21 but also the pocket
proteins and thereby modulates E2F activity by multiple means,
this result suggests that pRb remains partially active in p21
nulligenic cells. We also observed that MCM7, while induced in the
K14E7CVQ mouse tissues, was not induced in the most terminally
differentiated cells (Fig. 3B). This observation is consistent with the
hypothesis that the inactivation of p21 by E7 contributes partially
to the activation of E2Fs by E7. Loss of pRb protein alone is not
sufficient to completely account for the ability of E7 to up-regulate

E2F-dependent transcription, particularly in the suprabasal compartment because MCM7 expression was less frequently observed
in the suprabasal cells of the cervix of K14creRb f/f mice compared
with that in K14E7 mice (15). These data raise the possibility that
the inactivation of p21 by E7 may play a more important role in
augmenting the ability of E7 to suppress the E2F inhibitory
function of p107 and/or p130. Alternatively, the influence of the
inactivation of p21 by E7 may be independent of a disruption of
pocket protein function. p21 can also inhibit proliferating cell
nuclear antigen-dependent DNA synthesis and E7 can override this
inhibition (16). Levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
expression were higher in E7-expressing keratinocytes in tissue
culture (17) and also in human patient samples (45). It is also
possible that the inhibition of the CDK-inhibitory activity of p21
alters the phosphorylation status on proteins in addition to the
pocket proteins. Of potential relevance in this context is the
observation that p16 induction is attenuated in tumors arising in
K14E7CVQ mice. Recently, it has been described that E7 associates
with polycomb group proteins including E2F6 and Bmi1, the latter
a transcriptional repressor of p16, and E7’s interaction with E2F6
was unaffected by the CVQ68-70AAA mutation (46). This raises the
interesting possibility that p21 inactivation by E7 contributes to the
modulation of epigenetic regulation of cellular genes by E7.
Therefore, it is likely that the inhibition of p21 by E7 has multiple
effects on the cell cycle that are not restricted to the modulation of
pocket protein function.
In summary, our data show that that p21 functions as a tumor
suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis, that the inactivation of p21
by E7 correlates with the induction of carcinogenesis by E7, but
that the inactivation of p21 cannot account fully for the oncogenic
potential of E7.
