ABSTRACT
Abnormal expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays an essential role in
tumor cell dissemination and disease progression. However, the significance of CXCR4
overexpression in de novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is unknown. In 743

patients with de novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who received standard
Rituximab-CHOP immunochemotherapy, we assessed the expression of CXCR4 and
dissected its prognostic significance in various DLBCL subsets. Our results showed that
CXCR4+ patients was associated with male, bulky tumor, high Ki-67 index, activated
B-cell-like (ABC) subtype, and Myc, Bcl-2 or p53 overexpression. Moreover, CXCR4+
was an independent factor predicting poorer progression-free survival in germinalcenter B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL, but not in ABC-DLBCL; and in patients with an IPI
of ≤2, but not in those with an IPI>2. The lack of prognostic significance of CXCR4
in ABC-DLBCL was likely due to the activation of p53 tumor suppressor attenuating
CXCR4 signaling. Furthermore, concurrent CXCR4+ and BCL2 translocation showed
dismal outcomes resembling but independent of MYC/BCL2 double-hit DLBCL. Gene
expression profiling suggested that alterations in the tumor microenvironment and
immune responses, increased tumor proliferation and survival, and the dissemination
of CXCR4+ tumor cells to distant organs or tissues were underlying molecular
mechanisms responsible for the CXCR4+ associated poor prognosis.

INTRODUCTION

40% of DLBCL. Approximately 70% of DLBCLs have at
least one and 30% have multiple extranodal involvements
[19,20]. With the standard immunochemotherapy regimen
consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), approximately
one-third of DLBCL patients develop relapsed/refractory
disease [21]. Gene expression profiling (GEP) divides
DLBCL into two main subtypes according to cell-oforigin gene signatures: germinal center B-cell-like (GCB),
arising from the germinal center (GC) compartment,
and activated B-cell-like (ABC), arising from post-GC
plasmablastic cells [22]. During the development of
mature B-cells, CXCR4 is expressed at higher levels in
centroblasts localized in the CXCL12-rich dark zone
than in centrocytes in the light zone of the GC. CXCR4
is also upregulated during plasma cell differentiation and
expressed in memory B-cells [23-27].
The prognostic significance of CXCR4 expression in
lymphoma, which has different CXCL12 gradients at the
primary sites compared to other types of cancers [28], has
not been well studied. Moreover, it is unknown whether
the use of a CXCL12/CXCR4 antagonist in nodal DLBCL
will result in lymphoma cell mobilization and increased
spreading [8,29-32]. Very recently, CXCR4 expression was
correlated to disease progression in 12 cases of primary
testicular DLBCL [33] and poor survival of 94 DLBCL
cases [34]. In 20 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas,
a significant decrease in CXCR4 mRNA expression in the
BM after treatment correlated with a significantly lower
risk of death [35]. In this study, we assessed the surface
expression of CXCR4 using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
in 743 patients with de novo DLBCL, compared the gene
expression profiles and protein expression of biomarkers
between CXCR4+ and CXCR4– DLBCLs, and evaluated
the prognostic value of CXCR4 expression. We also tested
the effect of the high-affinity CXCL12/CXCR4 inhibitor
BTK140 (4F-benzoyl-TN14003) on DLBCL cells in
vitro, which not only inhibits CXCL12/CXCR4 mediated
adhesion and migration [36], overcomes stromal cells-

CXCR4 (CD184) is a chemokine receptor specific
for CXCL12. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is critical
to the retention of B-cell precursors in bone marrow
(BM), homing of B lymphocytes to lymph nodes, and
infiltration of T-cells and other immune cells expressing
CXCR4 [1]. Signaling molecules, physiological stimuli,
and co-translational modifications control the expression,
oligomerization, internalization, and degradation of
CXCR4. CD63, interleukin 21, hypoxia-inducible factor
1 alpha, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), CREB3, PAX3FKHR, Wnt, Notch, and PI3K/Akt pathways positively
regulate CXCR4 levels. In contrast, p53 [2], tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma, and
ubiquitination modification negatively regulate CXCR4
levels [3-6]. Activated CXCL12/CXCR4 in turn activates
signaling cascades such as PI3K/Akt, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), integrin, tyrosine kinases, and
G-proteins [3,4].
Abnormal CXCR4 surface expression in solid
tumors, has been shown to be responsible for their
metastasis to particular organs with high CXCL12
levels (e.g., lymph nodes, bones, and BM) [3,7,8], and
have prognostic significance for disease progression in
breast, colorectal, and renal cancers, and hepatocellular
carcinoma [3,9,10]. In leukemia, CXCR4 expression
conferred leukemic blasts with a higher capacity to seed
into BM niches, thereby protecting leukemic cells from
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and was correlated
with shorter disease-free survival [3,11-15]. Conversely,
neutralizing the interactions of CXCL12/CXCR4
disrupted metastasis, induced apoptosis, and increased
chemosensitivity in solid cancers and leukemia [7,16-18].
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most
common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults.
DLBCL typically presents as a nodal or extranodal mass
with rapid tumor growth. Extranodal DLBCL (primary
sites are outside the lymphatic system) accounts for 30www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mediated chemoresistance, but also has direct cytotoxic
activities in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, leukemic
and multiple myeloma cells in a CXCR4-dependent and
dose-dependent manner [29,37].

of the training set was 20% of tumor cells positive for
CXCR4 cell surface expression, which was used as the
cutoff for CXCR4 overexpression (CXCR4+). Using this
cutoff (≥20%), we found that 28.8% of the samples in the
training cohort were CXCR4+.
CXCR4 cell surface expression and mRNA levels
were higher in the ABC than GCB subtype, whereas
CXCL12 mRNA levels did not differ significantly between
the two groups (Figures 1E-F, Supplemental Figure 1C).
CXCR4 expression detected via IHC was significantly
correlated with CXCR4 mRNA levels (P < .0001,
Supplemental Figure 1D), and intriguingly, significantly
correlated with lower CXCL12 mRNA levels (Figure 1G).

RESULTS
CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression
IHC results (representative positive and negative
staining was shown in Figures 1A-C) indicated that
in most of the DLBCLs, CXCR4 surface expression
level was low (Figure 1D, Supplemental Figures 1AB). The mean expression level in the 468 DLBCLs

Clinicopathologic features of patients with
CXCR4 expression

Only in patients with an IPI ≤2 was CXCR4+ expression
associated with significantly poorer OS (Figure 1N) and
PFS (P= .0002). In patients with an IPI >2, CXCR4+
expression did not have distinguishable prognostic
significance (OS, P= .88, Figure 1O; PFS, P= .91).
Since CXCL12 gradients differ in lymph nodes,
BM, and other tissues affecting chemotaxis, we analyzed
the prognostic impact of CXCR4 expression in lymph
nodes and extranodal sites separately (Figures 2A-B
showed CXCR4 cell surface expression and CXCL12
mRNA levels in nodal vs primary extranodal patients).
Although CXCR4 cell surface expression invariably
correlated with lower CXCL12 mRNA levels in both
nodal and extranodal sites (Figure 2C), CXCR4+
expression correlated with significantly poorer OS and
PFS only in nodal DLBCLs (Figures 2E-H) regardless of
extranodal involvement status (Supplemental Figure 1F).
In contrast, CXCR4 surface expression was negatively
correlated with CXCL12 mRNA levels only in patients
without BM involvement (Figure 2D). However, the
prognostic significance of CXCR4 in nodal DLBCL
was demonstrated in both groups either with or without
BM involvement at diagnosis (Figures 2I-L). Together,
these data suggested that the prognostic significance of
CXCR4 expression is independent of BM or extranodal
involvement, and reduction of CXCL12 mRNA levels in
the primary sites.

Clinically, CXCR4+ group had higher proportion
of male patients and patients with bulky tumors than
the CXCR4–group, and tended to have higher frequency
of >1 extranodal involvement (P= .089) (Table 1).
Pathologically, CXCR4+ GCB-DLBCLs compared to
CXCR4– GCB-DLBCLs more frequently had a high
Ki-67 index, TP53 mutations, Myc overexpression and
less frequently expressed BLIMP-1 or nuclear RelB.
In comparison, CXCR4+ ABC-DLBCLs compared to
CXCR4– ABC-DLBCLs had a higher percentage of
patients with a high Ki-67 index, p53, Myc, Bcl-2, PI3K
expression and lower occurrence of BCL6 translocations
and nuclear p50 expression (Table 2).

CXCR4 expression was

associated

with

CXCR4+ DLBCL patients had significantly poorer
overall survival (OS) (P= .0016) and progression-free
survival (PFS) (P= .0017) in the study group (Figures
1H-I). When examined in the GCB and ABC subtypes,
the adverse impact was significant for the PFS of patients
with CXCR4+ GCB-DLBCL (Figure 1K), and the OS
of patients with CXCR4+ ABC-DLBCL (Figure 1L).
Further multivariate analysis adjusting for clinical factors
of the study cohort indicated that CXCR4+ remained as
an independent prognostic factor for significantly poorer
OS (P= .02) and PFS (P= .03) in the overall DLBCL;
However, only in GCB- but not in ABC-DLBCL patients,
CXCR4+ expression was as an independent prognostic
factor for poorer PFS (P= .025). Interestingly, only in
patients with ABC-DLBCL was CXCR4+ expression
associated with wide-type (WT) p53 expression in the
study cohort (Supplemental Figure 1E, Table 2).
International Prognostic Index (IPI) score appeared
to be a determinant of CXCR4 prognostic significance.

Association and synergy among CXCR4, Bcl-2,
and Myc expression in GCB-DLBCL
CXCR4, Myc and Bcl-2 expression showed
association in both the GCB and ABC subtypes (Figures
3A-H). Myc and Bcl-2 expression, and MYC and BCL2
translocation have been correlated with poor clinical
outcomes [38-40]. We therefore assessed the dependency
and synergism among the prognostic impact of CXCR4,
Myc, and Bcl-2 expression.
Although the inverse correlation between CXCR4
surface expression and CXCL12 mRNA levels was

mutations in GCB-DLBCL

independent of Bcl-2/Myc expression status (Supplemental
Figures 3A-D), CXCR4+ expression correlated with
significantly poorer survival in patients with Bcl-2+ GCBDLBCL (Figures 3I-J) or Bcl-2– ABC-DLBCL, but not in
patients with Bcl-2– GCB-DLBCL or Bcl-2+ ABC-DLBCL
(Supplemental Figure 2). Within the GCB-DLBCL group,
in which CXCR4+ and BCL2 translocations are prognostic
[40], CXCR4 expression showed remarkable synergism
with BCL2 translocations (Figures 3K-L), in a manner
no less significant than the synergism between MYC and
BCL2 translocations (Figure 3M).
Similarly, CXCR4 expression was synergistic with
Myc overexpression (Figure 3N); however, when the
group was classified into GCB and ABC subtypes, this
result did not remain statistically significant (Supplemental
Figures 1G-J).
Among Myc+/Bcl-2+ patients, CXCR4 expression
had an additive adverse impact in patients with GCBDLBCL (Figures 3O-P, P= .08 for OS and P= .06 for
PFS), but this impact was not statistically significant in
patients with ABC-DLBCL (Supplemental Figures 1K-L).

In CXCR4+ GCB-DLBCL, the frequency of TP53
mutations (which correlated with poor clinical outcomes
[41]) was much higher than in CXCR4– GCB-DLBCL
(38.3% vs 21.3%, P= .017, Table 2). However, the adverse
impact of CXCR4 expression was independent of TP53
mutations (Supplemental Figure 3G-H). Conversely,
patients with mutated (MUT)-p53 expressed higher
CXCR4 levels and lower CXCL12 mRNA levels than
patients with WT-p53, with significant P values within the
GCB subtype (Figures 4A-C).
Blimp-1 was another tumor suppressor that
was significantly downregulated in CXCR4+ GCBDLBCL (Figures 4D-E), and this downregulation may
also contribute to the prognostic impact of CXCR4
overexpression.

Multivariate survival analysis of CXCR4, Myc,
Bcl-2, and TP53 mutations
Since CXCR4 expression was associated with Myc/
Bcl-2 expression and TP53 mutations, all of which are
adverse prognostic factors, multivariate survival analysis

CXCL12 mRNA levels, both in nodal and extranodal DLBCL. (D) CXCR4 cell surface expression correlated with decreased CXCL12
mRNA levels in DLBCL patients without bone marrow (BM) involvement. (E-F) CXCR4 expression correlated with significantly poorer

of the pathological factors (including CXCR4+, Myc+,
Bcl-2+ and TP53 mutations) and the clinical parameters
(including IPI, gender, tumor size, and B symptoms) was
performed, which indicated CXCR4 was an independent
prognostic factor for disease progression (hazard ratio
1.56, 95% confidence interval of rate 1.13-2.46, P= .008.
Table 3).
However, when dissected in the GCB and ABC
subtypes, the independent prognostic significance of
CXCR4+ was limited to GCB-DLBCL (P= .04 for PFS);
in ABC-DLBCL, Myc and Bcl-2 overexpression and TP53
mutations but not CXCR4 expression, independently
predicted poorer survival (Table 3).
We validated the prognostic significance of CXCR4
in an independent DLBCL cohort (n=275) and confirmed
that the prognostic significance of CXCR4 was most
common in patients with an IPI ≤2, depended on Bcl-2
overexpression in GCB-DLBCL, and had synergy with

Myc expression (Supplemental Figure 4).

Differentially expressed genes in CXCR4+ versus
CXCR4– DLBCL patients
We compared the GEP of CXCR4+ and CXCR4–
DLBCLs, and found that 447 genes were significantly
differentially expressed with a false discovery rate
(FDR) threshold .01 and a fold change cutoff of over
1.41 (Table 4). Likely owing to the significantly reduced
CXCL12 expression, which facilitates T cell infiltration
and trafficking, the GEP of patients with CXCR4+
DLBCL revealed remarkably lower expression of T-cell
and innate immune response biomarkers (MHC class II
molecules HLA-DQA1/HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRB1/HLADRB4, TRBC1, GIMAP1, FYN, FYB, LCP2, CD3E,
SIRPG, C3, LAT, MAF, and SAMHD1 involved in antigen
presentation and T cell signaling) indicating worse

prognosis [42], and cell adhesion genes. In addition,
CXCR4 gene signatures also included upregulated
survival genes and downregulated pro-apoptosis genes
in CXCR4+ tumor cells. Upregulated genes included SFN
(2.57 fold) which stimulates the Akt/mTOR pathway,
HELLS which is involved in lymphoid cell survival (1.55
fold), Myc-responsive gene CDCA7 which contributes to
the Myc-mediated tumorigenesis (1.51 fold), oncogenic
transcription factor AFF3 (1.45 fold), FAM72A which
regulates cell growth (1.44 fold), and antipoptotic PEG10
(1.85 fold). In contrast, pro-apoptotic RASSF4 was
downregulated (1.42 fold). AICDA, encoding activationinduced cytidine deaminase which mediates somatic
hypermutation and class-switch recombination, was
upregulated by 2.92 fold in patients with CXCR4+ DLBCL
(3.32 fold in ABC-DLBCL and 2.12 fold in GCB-DLBCL,
Figures 4F-G). Furthermore, these signatures largely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

overlapped the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
identified between CXCR4+ and CXCR4– DLBCL patients
with an IPI ≤2 (Supplemental Figure 3I and Table 5),
whereas no DEGs were identified between CXCR4+ and
CXCR4– DLBCLs with an IPI >2.
GCB-DLBCL and ABC-DLBCL have distinct
molecular programs, therefore, CXCR4 expression
signatures were further identified in the GCB and ABC
subsets separately (Figures 4H-I and Table 4). The
immunosuppressive, proliferative, and antiapoptotic
CXCR4 signatures were observed in both GCB and ABC
subtypes. In GCB-DLBCL, downregulation of FYB, LCP2,
LILRB2, SAMHD1, and HLA-E, suggested decreased
adaptive and innate immune responses. In ABC-DLBCL,
downregulation of FYN, FYB, TRBC1, STAT4, C2, and
LST1, suggested decreased adaptive immune responses. In
ABC-DLBCL, the proliferation and antiapoptotic CXCR4
5607

signatures were remarkable, such as upregulation of genes
involved in the cell cycle progression, mitosis, translation,
metabolism and antiapoptosis (including CDK2, HELLS,
CCDC52, FARSA, hypoxia-inducible lipid-dropletassociated protein [HILPDA], PEG10, PIM2, and
BECN1), and downregulation of the mTORC1 inhibitor
TXNIP, the tumor suppressors BCL11B and TBRG1.
The involvement of the Myc and TP53 pathways in the
CXCR4 signaling was suggested by the upregulation of
PIM2, which increases Myc stability and transcriptional
activity, and the downregulation of BCL11B and TBRG1,
which activate p53.
Many genes were differentially regulated in GCB

and ABC subtypes, including the ones involved in the
PI3K pathway (Figures 4J-L), MAPK signaling, NF-κB
and angiogenesis (Table 4). In GCB-DLBCL, positive
regulation of the MAPK pathway by CXCR4 expression
was suggested by the upregulation of DOK5, PTHLH
(which transports calcium), and STIM2 (which activates
Ca2+ entry channels) and the downregulation of its
negative regulator DUSP4. In contrast, in ABC-DLBCL,
negative regulation of MAPK by CXCR4 signaling was
indicated by the downregulation of FYN upstream of
the MAPK signaling pathway, and the downregulation
of calcium-dependent molecules such as MFAP4. In the
GCB subtype, CYLD and UBD which activate NF-κB

showed opposite regulations: NF-κB activators CARD11
and PIM2 were upregulated, whereas TNFSF12, TNFSF8
and IL12RB were downregulated (Figure 4I, Supplemental
Figures 3J-L). In CXCR4+ GCB-DLBCL, PTPN6/PTN6

with functional networks of cell-to-cell signaling and
interaction, immune cell trafficking, hematological
system development and function, cellular growth and
proliferation, cell death and survival (Supplemental Figure
5).

We assessed the effect of the CXCR4 inhibitor
BTK140 on growth of DLBCL cells. In 10 cell lines of
either the GCB or ABC subtype, BKT140 treatment
resulted in a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition
in all 10 cell lines, with half maximal inhibitory
concentration values ranging from 16.55 to 79.33 nM;
however, the inhibition did not appear to depend on
CXCR4 expression (Figure 5A-B). BTK140 indeed
inhibit CXCR4-mediated cell adhesion, suggested by the
alteration of growth patterns of DLBCL cells expressing
high CXCR4 mRNA. The proliferation pattern of DLBCL
cells changed from adhesive to discohesive after 48 hours
of incubation with different concentrations of BKT140
(Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION

values in different disease subsets although it consistently
correlated with decreased CXCL12 mRNA levels in these
subsets (Figures 2, 3, Supplemental Figures 2, 3A-D).
Therefore, CXCL12 reduction alone may be insufficient
to account for the CXCR4-associated disease progression.
Furthermore, our protein expression and GEP data
suggested that the impact of CXCR4 on lymphoma relapse
and progression of de novo DLBCL may be attributed to
dysregulations in both the tumor microenvironment and
the tumor cells themselves. These mechanisms used by
CXCR4 for tumor cell survival may include reduced
immune surveillance, increased tumor proliferation
involving the upregulation of the Myc and PI3K/
mTOR pathways, and blocked apoptosis involving Bcl2 expression and the TP53 pathway. Previous studies
showed that p53 negatively regulated expression of
CXCR4 [2] (consistent with our results) and CXCL12
[46,47] (inconsistent with our mRNA results) abrogating
the stromal cell-mediated chemoresistance. The role
of CXCR4 signaling in promoting proliferation and
survival was supported by the in vitro studies, where the
high-affinity CXCR4 inhibitor BTK140 alone resulted
in inhibited proliferation as well as inhibitory changes
of adhesion and growth patterns in various DLBCL cell
lines. These novel oncogenic mechanisms, in addition
to the dissemination of CXCR4+ tumor cells to distant
lymphatic tissues with high CXCL12 concentrations, may
synergistically account for the CXCR4-mediated disease
progression.
In cancer cells, CXCR4 expression can be caused by
hypoxia, NF-κB activation, and ubiquitination inhibition
[4]. In some patients of our cohort, increased CXCR4
expression may have resulted from reduced degradation,
as suggested by decreased expression of UBD/ubiquitin D
and the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD in GCB-DLBCL
and decreased E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCH2 in
ABC-DLBCL. In ABC-DLBCL, upregulated SUGT1,
which plays a role in ubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation of target proteins, may counteract
the CXCR4 increase. Hypoxia (as suggested by increased
HILPDA) which is known for CXCR4 activation [3,4,9],
may also be the causes of CXCR4 expression in ABCDLBCL.
Cell-of-origin may as well explain the CXCR4+
phenotype. Some CXCR4+ GCB-DLBCLs may represent
lymphoma cells arising from CXCR4high centroblasts in the
CXCL12-rich dark zone and CXCR4– GCB-DLBCLs may
be the transformed CXCR4low centrocytes in the light zone,
where B cells interact with follicular dendritic and T helper
cells. This hypothesis is in line with the higher activationinduced cytidine deaminase levels, highly proliferative
characteristics, and the lack of T cell signature in CXCR4+
patients [23,24], but is contradicted by the CXCR4+
associated low CXCL12 levels. A plausible explanation
is that abnormal reduction in CXCL12 expression in
lymph nodes (due to oncogenic mechanisms such as

The CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is essential for
development, hematopoiesis, vascularization [4], and
migration, homing and retention of stem cells. In the
current study, CXCR4 expression was associated with
poorer OS (P= .0016) and PFS (P= .0017) in a large cohort
of 468 de novo DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP
(Figures 1H-I) and poorer therapy response in 236
GCB-DLBCLs. However, although univariate analysis
of CXCR4 expression showed prognostic significance
in both GCB and ABC subtypes, multivariate analysis
indicated that CXCR4 expression was an independent
prognostic factor for poorer PFS only in GCBDLBCL patients. Furthermore, our data suggested that
concurrent CXCR4 expression and BCL2 translocation
may represent another type of double-hit DLBCL with
aggressive clinical courses. In ABC-DLBCL, Myc/
Bcl-2 expression and TP53 mutations but not CXCR4
expression independently predicted poor survival. The
lack of independent prognostic significance of CXCR4
expression in ABC-DLBCL was likely due to the tumor
suppression function of WT-p53 whose expression was
associated with CXCR4+ in ABC-DLBCL. It may also be
attributed to the significantly (P= .0047) higher proportion
of patients with an IPI>2 in ABC (68.4%) than in GCB
(55%), as the prognostic significance and biologic impact
of CXCR4 expression was only demonstrated in patients
with low-risk IPI.
It is widely accepted that the CXCR4/CXCL12
axis underlies the decreased chemosensitivity and disease
progression, by directing CXCR4-expressing tumor cells
through concentration gradients of CXCL12 to reside
in protective niche (such as BM and lymph nodes). Our
results showed that CXCR4 expression had a significant
prognostic impact in nodal DLBCL but not extranodal
DLBCL. However, only 10.7% CXCR4+ patients showed
BM involvement at diagnosis, and the adverse impact of
CXCR4 expression in nodal DLBCL is independent of BM
involvement, suggesting other malignant consequences
besides BM homing ensuing CXCR4 expression in
DLCBL. In patients without BM involvement, we
surprisingly observed an inverse correlation between
CXCR4 surface expression and CXCL12 mRNA
expression in stromal cells. This paradoxical phenomenon
was also observed in primary kidney tumor tissues [43].
We speculate that the abnormal CXCR4high/CXCL12low
condition at the primary sites lead to the dissemination
of CXCR4+ lymphoma cells to distant organs expressing
higher CXCL12, which resulted in disease progression
of CXCR4+ DLBCL. Supporting this hypothesis,
CXCL12 expression was a strong independent prognostic
biomarker for better survival in breast cancers [44], and
administration of CXCL12 has been suggested as a potent
inhibitor of colorectal and melanoma metastasis [45].
In addition, CXCR4+ demonstrated different prognostic

dysregulated TNF cytokines or Myc overexpression,
or as the secondary event of BCL2 translocation in the
GC) initiated the tumorigenesis. This was selected for
CXCR4high lymphoma cells due to the dynamics of
CXCL12/CXCR4 equilibrium and led to decreased T cell
infiltration and deficient immune responses due to reduced
chemoattraction, cooperating with the CXCR4-associated
pro-survival signals. Decreased CXCL12 expression
further led to dissemination of CXCR4+ tumor cells to
distant lymphatic tissues with higher CXCL12 expression
[28, 51]. Therefore, the abnormal CXCL12/CXCR4 levels
may be relevant for both lymphomagenesis and disease
progression.
In conclusion, our results indicated CXCR4
expression was associated with poorer clinical outcomes in
DLBCL and independently predicted disease progression
in GCB-DLBCL. The underlying mechanisms whereby
CXCR4 exerts its prognostic impact may include tumor
growth promotion, apoptosis inhibition, decreased T
cell infiltration and immune responses, and tumor cell
dissemination to distant organs/tissues. These results could
help stratify DLBCL and gain insight of molecular events
that function as therapeutic targets.

IHC of other biomarkers using respective
monoclonal antibodies, fluorescence in situ hybridization
to detect MYC, BCL6, and BCL2 translocations, and TP53

Gene expression profiling
GEP by the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 array was performed using total RNAs
extracted from FFPE tissues as previously described [3841,48,49]. Normalized microarray data were analyzed
for differential gene expression between the CXCR4+
and CXCR4– groups. Univariate analysis using a t test
was performed to identify differentially expressed genes.
The P values obtained via multiple t-tests were corrected
for FDRs using the beta-uniform mixture method.
Differentially expressed genes were identified at various
FDRs with different P value cutoffs. Pathway analysis
for the identified DEGs was performed using Ingenuity®

Effect of CXCR4 inhibitor BTK140 in vitro

The training study consisted of 468 patients with
de novo DLBCL diagnosed between 2000 and 2010
and treated with R-CHOP (median age: 63 years).
The diagnostic criteria, review process, eligibility and
exclusion criteria, cell-of-origin classification as either
GCB or ABC subtype via GEP or IHC algorithms have
been described previously [38,41,48]. At last followup, 176 of 468 (37.6%) patients had died. The median
follow-up for the 292 censored patients was 48.7 months.
For validation, an independent cohort of 275 de novo
DLBCLs diagnosed between 2002 and 2007 and treated
with R-CHOP was used, with median follow-up of 50
months. This study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved as being
of minimal to no risk or as exempt by the Institutional
Review Boards of all participating centers, including The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

The inhibitory effect of BTK140 (kind gift from
BioLineRx Ltd, Jerusalem, Israel) was evaluated in 10
DLBCL cell lines that were either the GCB (DBr, DOHH2,
SUDHL4, CJ, McA, LY19) or ABC (LY3, WP, LR, and
LY10) subtype that were cultured and maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) and
15% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA). [3H]
thymidine proliferation assays in vitro were performed
as described previously [50]. Different concentrations of
BKT140 were used: 3.125 µM, 6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, 25
µM, 50 µM, 100 µM, and 200 µM. Cell proliferation was
measured using 3H-thymidine incorporation assays after
72 hours of incubation.

Statistical analysis
The clinicopathologic features of CXCR4+ and
CXCR4– DLBCL patients at the time of presentation
were compared using the chi-square test. Overall survival
was calculated from the time of diagnosis to death from
any cause or last follow-up. Progression-free survival
was calculated from the time of diagnosis to disease
progression, relapse, or death from any cause.21 Patients
who were alive and/or had no disease progression
were censored at last follow-up. Survival analysis was
