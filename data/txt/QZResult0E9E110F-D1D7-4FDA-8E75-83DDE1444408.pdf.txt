BACKGROUND. Few randomized trials have compared the survival benefit of interferon-alfa over controls in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and none has been performed using interleukin-2. The Programme Etude Rein Cytokines (PERCY) Quattro
trial was designed to evaluate both cytokines for their survival benefit to intermediate
prognosis patients, who represent the majority of candidates for these treatments.

METHODS. Patients were randomized in a 2-by-2 factorial design to medroxyprogesterone acetate 200 mg daily, interferon-alfa 9 million IU 3 times a week, subcutaneous interleukin-2 9 million IU daily, or a combination of both cytokines.
Tumor response was evaluated at Week 12 and Month 6; progression-free
patients received further identical treatment for a maximum of 3 additional
months. Primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life. Survival was ana-

Cytokines in Metastatic Renal Cancers/Negrier et al.

M

etastatic renal carcinoma is refractory to chemotherapy, and patient survival is generally around
1 year.1–3 Since the late 1980s, interferon alfa (IFN)
and interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been used in this indication in most western countries, and many phase 2 studies have shown that tumor regressions were induced
in small subsets of patients. Very few reports, however,
have demonstrated improved survival with these cytokines. A complete review and a pooled analysis of the
literature in the field were recently performed by the
Cochrane Collaboration.4 Analysis of the 4 available
randomized trials showed that IFN is associated with a
3.8-month longer weighted-average median survival
than nonimmunotherapy controls, ie, medroxyprogesterone or vinblastine.5–8 The benefit of interleukin-2
single agent on survival has never been tested against
control, and comparisons with other treatments have
failed to show any advantage of this cytokine.4
In 1998, the Groupe Francais d’Immunotherapie
reported results of a large multicenter trial that compared IL-2, IFN, and their combination, which failed
to show any survival advantage.9 The study also tested
predictive factors of response and failure to these
treatments and identified 3 subgroups of patients.10
Good prognosis patients with only 1 metastatic site
have a 37% chance of response to a combination of
both cytokines and a rather long survival (median, 25
months; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 16 to 34
months). On the opposite, patients combining several
metastatic organ sites, liver metastases, and a time
interval from primary tumor to metastases below 1
year have more than a 70% probability of treatment
failure and very poor outcome (median survival, 6
months; 95% CI, 4 to 8 months). Actually, these 2 subgroups represented 20% and 25%, respectively, of the
patients enrolled in the study. The remaining 55% had
an intermediate prognosis for cytokine efficacy.
The Groupe Francais d’Immunotherapie adapted
its treatment strategy accordingly: a combination of
cytokines is proposed to good prognosis patients,
whereas poor prognosis patients are no longer candidates for cytokines. In the third group with intermediate prognosis, the benefit of cytokines remains
questionable. The Programme Etude Rein Cytokines
(PERCY) Quattro trial addresses the survival benefit
to these patients of cytokines over medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), which has been considered a
good control option.5,7,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Selection of Patients
Patients older than 18 years of age were eligible if
they had histologically confirmed, clearly progressive,

2469

metastatic renal carcinoma of all histologic subtypes
(occurrence of metastasis or progression of previously known metastasis), more than 1 metastatic
organ, and good performance status (Karnofsky score
80%), or 1 metastatic organ with Karnofsky score
80%, normal blood and liver functions with creatinine level 160 lmol/L. Patients with previous systemic treatment, radiotherapy within 6 weeks of
randomization, evidence of brain metastases, uncontrolled cardiac dysfunction, active infections, or current corticosteroid treatment were not eligible.
Patients with a history of organ transplantation,
other cancer or seizure, and pregnant or lactating
women were excluded. The baseline workup consisted of thoracic, abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography (CT) scans, brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or CT scan, and bone scan. The number of organs with metastases was determined in
each patient before randomization.

Trial Design
Patients were randomly assigned in a 2-by-2 factorial
design11 to either MPA, subcutaneous IFN, subcutaneous IL-2, or a combination of IFN and IL-2. Treatments were administered unblinded. This 2-by-2
factorial design was chosen to assess the same pool
of patients for the effect of IFN and the effect of IL-2
on survival; it also allowed testing of the impact of a
combination of these cytokines. The Cancer du Rein
et Cytokines (CRECY) trial, previously conducted by
our group, had tested IL-2 and IFN combination and
indicated that there was no interaction between the
2 drugs in terms of overall survival.9
The hypotheses of survival at 2 years were 10%
(l), 20% (l 1 la) and 25% (l 1 lb) for patients
assigned to MPA, IFN, and IL-2, respectively. The
sample size was calculated to allow 2 main comparisons, 1 between patients assigned to IFN or not, and
1 between patients assigned to IL-2 or not. Assuming
that IFN and IL-2 act independently, the required
size to compare IFN (combination of IFN and
IFN 1 IL-2 arms) versus non-IFN (combination of
MPA and IL-2 arms) groups was given by the
comparison of a 17.5% [(l 1 (l 1 lb))/2] survival at
2 years in the non-IFN group to a 27.5%
[((l 1 la) 1 (l 1 la 1 lb))/2] survival in the IFN
group, which corresponds to a hazard ratio of 1.35.
Assuming 80% power and .05 significance level, the
planned sample size was 456 patients (114 in each of
the 4 arms),12 and the number of expected deaths at
the final analysis was 348. This sample size was also
sufficient to detect a 15% difference between IL-2
and non-IL-2 groups.

Randomization was stratified by participating
center by using a block method with a block size of
4, and it was performed centrally through a specific
website. The protocol was approved by the local
ethics committee and institutional review board, in
compliance with French law. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before randomization. An independent review committee (experts
are listed in the title page footnotes) evaluated the
quality of the study, principally data monitoring and
statistical analysis, and proposed the main conclusions to be drawn from the results. This committee
validated the decision to perform the final analysis.

Treatment
Medroxyprogesterone (Farlutal; Pfizer, Paris, France)
was given orally as 200 mg once daily. Interferonalfa (Roche, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) was given
subcutaneously as 9 million IU 3 times a week. Interleukin-2 (Chiron, Suresnes, France) was given subcutaneously on a 4-week schedule as follows: 9 million
IU twice daily for 5 days followed by a 2-day rest,
then, during the following 3 weeks, 9 million IU
twice daily for 2 days and then 9 million IU once
daily for 3 days. After a week of rest, an identical 4week cycle was administered. The IFN-IL-2 combination was given by using identical routes, schedules,
and doses except for the reduction of IFN dose to
6 million IU per injection. Tumor evaluation was performed 12 weeks after treatment start in all treatment arms; patients without disease progression
were eligible for a second treatment course. Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed. All
treatments were planed to have an overall duration
of 6 months to ensure that patients were treated for
the same length of time, whatever their randomization group.
Assessment of Response, Toxicity, and Quality of Life
Tumor response was classified in accordance with
World Health Organization criteria.13 Objective responses included both complete and partial responses, assessed by thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic
CT scan. Tumor evaluation was performed 12 weeks
after treatment start and between Weeks 24 and
26 in patients receiving further therapy. Adverse
events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (USA) toxicity criteria,14 and quality of
life through the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)15; patients were proposed to
complete these questionnaires immediately before
treatment and several days before tumor assessment
at 12 weeks.

Statistical Analysis
Overall survival was calculated from the date of
randomization to the date of death from any cause,
or to the date of last follow-up for living patients
(censored observation). Survival estimates were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method.16 Differences in survival estimates between groups (ie,
patients assigned to IFN or not, and those assigned
to IL-2 or not) were assessed by the log-rank test17
with an assigned .025 level of significance for each of
the main comparisons. IFN-IL-2 interaction was
tested by introducing a specific multiplication term
in a Cox proportional hazards model.18 Median follow-up was calculated by using reverse Kaplan-Meier
estimation.19
Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival measured from date of randomization to date
of disease progression or death, or censored at last
follow-up; objective tumor response assessed by descriptive statistical analysis; toxicity profiles tested by
using the chi-square test; and quality of life assessed
according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual.20
Baseline scores for each quality-of-life domain and
variations at Week 12 were calculated for each
patient and compared between arms.
Primary outcome results were adjusted for unbalanced baseline characteristics (Cox model). The adequacy of the Cox model was tested, and the
proportional hazards assumption was found to be
reasonable.21 The analysis of the survival endpoint
was realized on an intent-to-treat basis. The analysis
plan was devised according to previous recommendations for factorial plan trials11 as follows: the absence of interaction between the 2 active treatments
must be checked before any survival comparison can
be made. Results were verified in a per-protocol
analysis, omitting ineligible patients or those receiving crossover treatments (see patient characteristics
below). All P values were 2-sided.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From January 2000 to July 2004, 492 metastatic renal
cell carcinoma patients were enrolled in 44 centers;
123 patients were randomly assigned to the MPA
arm, 122 to IFN, 125 to IL-2, and 122 to IL-2 plus
IFN. Hence, the 2 comparison groups included 244
patients who received IFN and 248 who did not
receive IFN and 247 patients who received IL-2 and
245 who did not receive IL-2 (Fig. 1).
A total of 29 patients with nonclear cell or sarcomatoid subtypes were included. Their distribution
between treatment arms was as follows: 4 patients

FIGURE 1. Trial design exhibits the 2-by-2 randomization procedure. Four patients did not receive the allocated treatment. Three patients received no treatment at all (1 patient in the interleukin-2 arm and 2 in the combination arm). One patient randomized to medroxyprogesterone (MPA) refused this treatment
and was given interferon.

received MPA, 7 received IFN, 14 received IL-2, and 4
received IFN 1 IL-2.
After review of patient clinical data, 18 (3.7%)
patients were found ineligible (4, 4, 2, and 8 patients
in the MPA, IFN, IL-2, and IFN 1 IL-2 arms, respectively); in addition, 3 (0.6%) patients received no systemic treatment, and 1 patient randomized to MPA
refused this treatment and was, thus, given interferon. Crossover between treatment groups occurred
in 58 (11.8%) patients who were well distributed
between arms (15, 13, 14, and 16 for the MPA, IFN,
IL-2, and IFN 1 IL-2 arms, respectively). Of the 15
(12.2%) patients initially assigned to MPA who were
crossed over to another treatment, 7 switched to
IFN, 3 to IL-2, and 5 to IFN 1 IL-2. A total of 174
patients with progressive disease received secondline treatment; these patients were well balanced
between randomization groups. Two potentially
active treatments were used as follows: 39 patients
were enrolled into a double-blind placebo trial with
sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer, West Haven, Conn), and 3
received bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche, Paris, France).
Major patient characteristics by treatment group
are detailed in Table 1. Only few significant differences were detected between comparison groups.
More non-IFN-treated than IFN-treated patients had
abdominal lymph nodes (31.2% vs 21.8%; P 5 .02),

and less non-IFN-treated than IFN-treated patients
had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
levels (16.2% vs 25.1%; P 5 .03). Among non-IL-2treated patients, 73.1% had normal hemoglobin
levels versus 63.8% among patients receiving IL-2
(P 5 .03). Comparison groups were overall considered well balanced.

Survival
Primary analysis
At the time of analysis, defined by decision of the independent review committee, the median follow-up
was 29.2 months, 335 patients had died, and the median overall survival was 15.3 months (95% CI, 14.5
to 17.5).
The interaction test between IFN and IL-2 was
not significant (P 5 .54), suggesting that the effect of
IFN was not related to the presence or the absence
of IL-2, and conversely, thus validating assumptions
of the factorial analysis.
Results were analyzed after combining treatment
groups 2 by 2 according to the factorial design of the
trial.11,22 There was no significant difference in survival between IFN-treated (166 deaths) and IFN-nontreated patients (169 deaths) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00;
95% CI, 0.81 to 1.24; log-rank test, P 5 .99) (Fig. 2A).

Four additional per-protocol analyses were performed: 1) after exclusion of the 18 patients with
major protocol deviation, 2) after exclusion of the 58
patients crossed over to another treatment, 3) on the
386 patients with proven clear cell renal cancer, or 4)
on the 270 patients not receiving second-line treatment. All yielded results similar to those of the first
analysis.

Progression-free survival analyses
The progression-free survival of IFN-treated patients
(217 progressions or deaths; median 3.5 months; 95%
CI, 3.1 to 5.3) was not significantly different (log-rank
test, P 5 .11) from that of non-IFN-treated patients
(231 events; median 3.2 months; 95% CI, 3.0 to 3.9).
Similarly, there was no significant difference in progression-free survival (log-rank test, P 5 .32) between
IL-2-treated patients (255 events; median 3.5 months;
95% CI, 3.1 to 5.3) and IL-2-nontreated patients (166

patients was 15.4 months (95% CI, 14.5 to 18.7) and
15.1 months (95% CI, 13.2 to 17.8), respectively. Similarly, there was no significant difference in survival
between IL-2-treated (169 deaths) and IL-2-nontreated patients (166 deaths) (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87
to 1.33; log-rank test, P 5 .52) (Fig. 2B). Median survival for IL-2-treated and IL-2-nontreated patients
was 15.7 months (95% CI, 14.4 to 18.4) and 14.9
months (95% CI, 12.8 to 18.7), respectively. The Cox

Response to Treatment
Table 3 shows the response status of the 465 evaluable patients at 12 weeks and 6 months after treatment start. The progression rate was similar across
comparison groups, even if a trend in favor of IFN
over non-IFN and IL-2 over non-IL-2 was observed.
The percentage of objective responses achieved at
Week 12 was 2.5% in the MPA control arm and 5.1%
in the 3 cytokine arms taken as a whole. After
6 months, percentages were, respectively, 1.6% and
5.6%.
Notably, no objective response was seen in evaluable patients with nonclear cell or sarcomatoid
subtypes, ie, papillary (n 5 21), chromophobe (n 5 4),

Toxicity of Treatment and Quality of Life
During the first 12 weeks, 365 (74.2%) patients completed the assigned treatment; 219 (44.5%) received

a second course. Table 4 shows the most frequent
toxic effects by reporting the number of patients
having grade 3 or 4 adverse events. The percentage of patients with at least 1 grade 3 or 4 toxic
event was 9.9% in the MPA group versus 58.9% in
the cumulative group of patients who received

Cytokines in Metastatic Renal Cancers/Negrier et al.

cytokines (P 5 .0001). No treatment-related death
was observed.
Overall, 408 patients (82.9%) completed the quality-of-life questionnaires at study start and 294
(59.8%) at Week 12. No statistical quality-of-life difference was observed at enrollment, but global
health status scores consistently decreased thereafter;
at Week 12, scores had decreased by 11%, 16%, and
33% in patients receiving MPA, IFN or IL-2, and
combined cytokines, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Since the first enthusiastic reports of IL-2 for the
treatment of advanced cancer patients,23 the therapeutic interest of this cytokine has dramatically
reduced. However, metastatic renal carcinoma has
remained the major indication for IL-2 until now.
Whereas first trials tested high intravenous bolus
doses, different doses and routes (especially subcutaneous administration) have become more commonly
used because of reduced toxicity and easier at-home
administration. Randomized trials comparing the 2
administration routes have shown a superiority of
high-dose intravenous IL-2 over subcutaneous IL-2
in response rates and complete response duration,
but they have failed to demonstrate any survival
advantage.24,25
As mentioned above, the efficacy of IL-2 on the
survival of metastatic renal carcinoma patients has
never been demonstrated. Several studies have compared effects of multiple combination treatments
with IL-2 to those of controls but, because of limited
sample sizes and conflicting results, these studies
have failed to demonstrate a clear survival benefit.26–28
Results of 3 studies that compared combined IL-2
treatments to either IFN or a combination of IFN
and vinblastine are available.9,29,30 Only Atzpodien
et al.29 have observed a survival advantage of IL-2,
but their trial was performed in highly selected
patients and did not demonstrate any advantage in
the primary endpoint, ie, response rate.
IFN alone was compared with MPA or vinblastine in 4 randomized studies, and only a limited survival benefit (2.6 months) was observed.5–8
The PERCY Quattro trial was designed to assess
the activity of IFN and/or IL-2 against a control with
MPA in intermediate prognosis patients, who represent the majority of candidates for cytokine treatments. Because this is the first trial addressing the
question of a survival benefit of IL-2 alone over a
control, our results could be of interest for further
routine treatments in these patients. The limits and
potential biases identified and, when possible, con-

2475

trolled by the investigators, must be acknowledged
and discussed.
The 2-by-2 factorial design used in the PERCY
Quattro trial required a smaller sample than 2 separate trials, each testing IFN or IL-2 against MPA. This
design assumed that the 2 cytokines acted independently (each was equally effective in the presence or
in the absence of the other) and that their combination would, at best, only have additive effects, as verified by results of the interaction test that did not
reach significance.
Results demonstrating the absence of significant
survival difference seem robust. The 2 log-rank tests
that compared overall survival between IL-2 versus
non-IL-2 or IFN versus non-IFN groups (P 5 .52, and
P 5 .99, respectively) indicated that, in all cases,
results were far from significant. In addition, even if
the trial design prevented a direct comparison of the
4 randomization groups, the median survivals
appeared very close.
An important potential bias that was identified
at the very beginning of the trial is the possibility of
crossing over treatments for patients randomized to
MPA. Specific explanations and recommendations
were regularly given to the investigators. They were
reminded that the benefit of IL-2 and/or IFN had
never been demonstrated in this subgroup, and that
if they, or the patient, hesitated to enroll because of
the possibility of being randomized to MPA, routine
treatment should be preferred. Further treatments
received by patients after failure of the assigned
treatment were registered and closely controlled by
on-site monitoring. Finally, 58 (11.8%) patients
crossed over between treatment arms, but only 15 of
the 123 (12%) patients on MPA were crossed over to
cytokines. Results of the per-protocol analysis of
comparison groups after exclusion of these patients
were virtually identical to those of the whole cohort
(data not shown).
During the enrollment period, an unexpected
bias was identified with the development of new
potentially active agents, namely angiogenesis inhibitors, that became available through clinical trials in
2003. At the time of analysis, 39 patients with failure
of their randomized treatment had entered a large
multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
with Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006; Bayer, West Haven,
Conn). Patients who were participating in this second-line trial were well balanced between the groups
of the present study.
The analysis of the PERCY Quattro trial demonstrated that there is no statistically significant difference between groups, indicating that neither low
doses of subcutaneous IL-2 nor IFN confer any sur-

vival advantage to patients with intermediate prognosis. IL-2, especially when used at high intravenous
bolus doses, induces tumor regressions in a limited
number of patients, but its effects are insufficient to
provide a survival gain. This conclusion is consistent
with the negative results of 2 recent studies that
explored adjuvant treatments with IL-2 used alone or
in combination with other drugs.31,32 According to
our results, patients with intermediate prognosis may
expect no survival gain from IFN either. Previous
studies found a survival benefit of IFN over MPA or
chemotherapy5,7,8; yet, the gain observed was limited
(2.6 months) and concerned all metastatic renal cancer patients. Finally, IFN failed to demonstrate any
survival benefit when used in the adjuvant setting.33–35
Results of the PERCY Quattro trial also indicated
that the risk of severe adverse events is significantly
higher (6-fold) with cytokines than with MPA.
In conclusion, our results show that low doses of
subcutaneous IL-2 and/or IFN do not provide a survival benefit for patients with metastatic renal cancer
of intermediate prognosis, but they do induce a significant risk of toxicity. Fortunately, new, seemingly
promising agents, mainly angiogenesis inhibitors,
have just become available for these patients.
