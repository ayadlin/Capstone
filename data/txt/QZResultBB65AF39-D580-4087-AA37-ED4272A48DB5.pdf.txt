ABSTRACT
Here, we evaluated whether the overexpression of transcriptionally inactive
ΔNp73 cooperates with PML/RARA fusion protein in the induction of an APL-leukemic
phenotype, as well as its role in vitro in proliferation, myeloid differentiation, and
drug-induced apoptosis. Using lentiviral gene transfer, we showed in vitro that ΔNp73
overexpression resulted in increased proliferation in murine bone marrow (BM) cells
from hCG-PML/RARA transgenic mice and their wild-type (WT) counterpart, with no
accumulation of cells at G2/M or S phases; instead, ΔNp73-expressing cells had a lower
rate of induced apoptosis. Next, we evaluated the effect of ΔNp73 on stem-cell selfrenewal and myeloid differentiation. Primary BM cells lentivirally infected with human
ΔNp73 were not immortalized in culture and did not present significant changes in the
percentage of CD11b. Finally, we assessed the impact of ΔNp73 on leukemogenesis
or its possible cooperation with PML/RARA fusion protein in the induction of an APLleukemic phenotype. After 120 days of follow-up, all transplanted mice were clinically
healthy and, no evidence of leukemia/myelodysplasia was apparent. Taken together,
our data suggest that ΔNp73 had no leukemic transformation capacity by itself and
apparently did not cooperate with the PML/RARA fusion protein to induce a leukemic
phenotype in a murine BM transplantation model. In addition, the forced expression
of ΔNp73 in murine BM progenitors did not alter the ATRA-induced differentiation
rate in vitro or induce aberrant cell proliferation, but exerted an important role in cell
survival, providing resistance to drug-induced apoptosis.

demonstrated that a high ΔNp73/TAp73 ratio is associated
with inferior outcome in patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) treated with all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy according
to the International Consortium on APL 2005 protocol [8].
However, the mechanism through which ΔNp73 leads to
adverse outcomes in APL remains to be elucidated and if
ΔNp73 works as a driver oncogene in APL is unknown.

INTRODUCTION
In the clinical setting, high expression of the NH2terminal truncated ΔNp73 isoforms (alone or in association
with full-length transcriptionally active TAp73, i.e., a
high ΔNp73/TAp73 ratio) has been associated with poor
prognosis in primary human tumors [1–3], including
hematological malignancies [4–6]. Recently [7], we

Using lentiviral gene transfer and murine bone marrow
(BM) transplantation, we evaluated whether the forced
expression of ΔNp73 cooperates with PML/RARA fusion
protein in the induction of an APL-leukemic phenotype.
We also investigated the role of ΔNp73 in proliferation,
myeloid differentiation, and drug-induced apoptosis.

expressing myeloid colonies was significantly higher
compared to their respective controls after adding Ara-C
100 µg/ml to the methylcellulose cultures (Figure 3C),
corroborating the resistance to drug-induced apoptosis
observed in liquid culture. To check whether the forced
expression of ΔNp73 affects myeloid differentiation, we
evaluated the percentage of CD11b-positive cells using
ATRA (1 μM, 7 days in liquid culture) as the standard
stimulus for differentiation. Immunophenotypic analysis
revealed that induced expression of human ΔNp73 did not
significantly change the percentage of CD11b-positive
cells (Figure 3D).
Finally, we assessed the impact of ΔNp73 on
leukemogenesis or its possible cooperation in vivo with
PML/RARA fusion protein in the induction of an APLleukemic phenotype by transplanting lethally irradiated
NOD/SCID mice (10 animals per group) with 3x105 GFPpositive BM cells (with or without human ΔNp73) from
hCG-PML/RARA cells or WT mice, along with 2x105
recipient-type BM cells. Following repopulation (at day
21 after transplantation), hemoglobin levels (P=0.03) and
platelet counts (P=0.044) were significantly higher in both
groups of mice transplanted with WT cells, regardless of
the presence of ΔNp73 (Supplementary Table 1). Fortyfive days after transplantation, a higher percentage of
ΔNp73-expressing cells was detected in the peripheral
blood of recipients compared to empty vector controls
(P<0.05, Figure 4A). However, after 120 days of followup [10–12], all transplanted mice were clinically healthy
and, according to the Bethesda criteria for hematopoietic
neoplasms in mice [13], no evidence of leukemia or
myelodysplasia was apparent after morphological
evaluation of BM or spleen cells. Immunophenotypic
analysis of BM recipients’ cells revealed no significant
difference between ΔNp73-expressing and non-ΔNp73expressing cells with respect to myeloid and lymphoid cell
markers (Figure 4B).
The hypothesis that ΔNp73 harbors oncogenic
potential is based on classical in vitro and in vivo
transformation assays that demonstrated a proliferative
advantage and/or cell immortalization of ΔNp73expressing cells [14–16]. Other studies have suggested
that differentiation, rather than proliferation and cell
immortalization, dictates the oncogenic potential of ΔNp73
[17]. By delaying or blocking differentiation, ΔNp73 could
prevent progenitors from reaching terminal differentiation,
keeping these cells in a constant proliferative state
and thereby enabling tumor development driven by
cooperating oncogenes. Interestingly, ΔNp73 has been
associated with the initiation of metastasis in melanoma
cells [18] and several lines of evidence support ΔNp73
as an important determinant for apoptotic response to
therapy [2, 9, 19]. Accordingly, cells from transgenic
mice selectively deficient for the ΔNp73 isoforms have
been shown to be more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents
and undergo increased p53-dependent apoptosis [20]. On

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
First, we evaluated the role of ΔNp73 in cell
proliferation. At the end of the fifth day of culture, the
forced expression of human ΔNp73 in hCG-PML/RARA
and WT murine cells resulted in increased proliferation
compared to respective controls (Figure 1A). Intriguingly,
after subsequent cell cycle analysis, we found no
accumulation of cells at G2/M or S phases. On the other
hand, number of cells at sub-G0 fraction was significantly
lower in ΔNp73-expressing cells than empty vector
controls (Figure 1B). We subsequently validated these
findings through annexin-V/propidium iodide staining
method, demonstrating that the basal apoptosis rate (i.e.,
spontaneous apoptosis) was less pronounced in ΔNp73expressing cells, regardless the presence of PML/RARA
fusion gene (Figure 1C).
These findings prompted us to investigate whether
ΔNp73 overexpression results in resistance to druginduced apoptosis. We performed an in vitro assay of
apoptosis using cytarabine (Ara-C, IC50: 100μg/ml) as the
apoptotic stimulus [9]. Twenty-four hours later, ΔNp73expressing cells had a lower rate of apoptosis than empty
vector controls (Figure 2A–2B). Next, we examined genes
related to apoptosis and cell cycle pathways that were
differentially expressed between hCG-PML/RARA cells
(expressing or not the human ΔNp73 gene) upon Ara-C
treatment. Using PCR array procedure, we identified a
set of 42 genes (39 upregulated and three downregulated)
differentially expressed in hCG-PML/RARA Np73expressing cells in comparison with empty vector control
(Figure 2C). As expected, most of genes were linked to
apoptosis pathways. Only three genes related to cell
cycle arrest were modulated by the presence of ΔNp73
in hCG-PM/RARA-positive cells (Mdm2, Cdkn2a (p21),
Mtbp). Of interest, apoptosis-associated genes in Np73expressing cells belonged to both mitochondrial-mediated
(intrinsic pathway) and receptor-mediated pathways
(extrinsic pathway).
Next, we evaluated the effect of ΔNp73 on stem cell
self-renewal and myeloid differentiation. Primary BM
cells from hCG-PML/RARA and WT mice infected with
human ΔNp73 were not immortalized in methylcellulose
culture. At first plating, the final number of myeloid
colonies was not different between ΔNp73-expressing cells
and their respective controls (Figure 3A). In addition, the
formation of colonies in methylcellulose was not sustained
after the third to fourth plating in none of the groups
(Figure 3B). Nevertheless, the final number of ΔNp73www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the other hand, the ectopic expression of transcriptionally
active TAp73 was able to reduce drug resistance to
chemotherapy in metastatic melanoma cells, which
expressed high levels of ΔNp73 [21]. In agreement with
this finding, down-regulation of the ΔNp73 isoforms by
antisense techniques has been shown to enhance TP53/

TAp73-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells in response to
chemotherapy [22, 23].
Here, we did not see evidence of malignant
transformation of pre-leukemic PML/RARA-positive cells
by the forced expression of ΔNp73 in in vitro or in vivo
experiments, but instead ΔNp73 overexpression provided

an adaptive clonal advantage in the presence of a proapoptotic stimulus. One may argue that mice transplanted
with PML/RARA-positive cells should develop an APLleukemic phenotype; nevertheless, it worth to note that
only 8-12% of hCG-PML/RARA transgenic mice develop
leukemia [24], and several evidence have demonstrated
that the presence of PML/RARA fusion oncoprotein in
transgenic mice is not per se sufficient to cause leukemia
[25–27]. Interestingly, the protective effect of ΔNp73 on
cell death apparently was not influenced by the presence
of the PML/RARA oncoprotein. Such an interaction
would be expected, considering the intricate functional
relationship between PML-p73-PML/RARA in APL
blasts. At least when overexpressed, wild-type PML
stabilizes p73 protein through acetylation, preventing
its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [28]. In
APL, p73 stability/activity may be impaired mainly due
to the disruption of PML-nuclear bodies by PML/RARA
oncoprotein. Currently, whether distinct p73 isoforms
(including the transactivation-deficient ΔNp73 isoform)
are differentially affected by impaired PML functions is
unknown.
Although the aforementioned and others issues
remain to be elucidated, it is undeniable the role of the
TP53 family members and their intricate relationship in
APL, in both onset and eradication of the disease. Gaillard
et al. compared the gene expression and methylation
profiles of purified promyelocyte populations from preleukemic MRP8-PML/RARA transgenic mice and showed
that, in the absence of secondary lesions, PML/RARA

has an overall limited impact on both the transcriptome
and methylome [29]. The authors observed significant
enrichment of the expression of cell cycle-related genes
in PML/RARA promyelocytes, which led to expansion
of the promyelocyte compartment and hypothesized that
PML/RARA initiates leukemia by subtly shifting cell fate
decisions within the promyelocyte compartment. Because
our data suggest that ΔNp73 plays an important role in
cell survival, it is conceivable that ΔNp73 participates
in expansion of the promyelocytic compartment as an
additional/secondary event. Following this reasoning,
Ablain et al. [30] demonstrated that a functional Pml-p53
axis is required to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells
in a mouse model of APL. Upon ATRA-induced PML/
RARA degradation, normal Pml elicits nuclear bodies
reformation and induces a p53 response, which exhibits
features of senescence, but not apoptosis. According
to our hypothesis, even with the restoration of the
nuclear bodies upon ATRA treatment and subsequent
activation of Trp53 signaling, it is theoretically possible
that the overexpression of ΔNp73 protein impairs p53
tumor suppressor functions, and thus coffering survival
advantage and/or resistance to chemotherapy to leukemic
cells.
Taken together, these findings lead us to two major
conclusions. First, ΔNp73 had no leukemic transformation
capacity by itself and apparently did not cooperate with
the PML/RARA fusion protein to induce a leukemic
phenotype in a murine BM transplantation model. Second,
the forced expression of ΔNp73 in murine BM progenitors

did not alter the ATRA-induced differentiation rate
in vitro or induce aberrant cell proliferation, but exerted
an important role in cell survival, providing resistance
to drug-induced apoptosis. We and others [2, 3, 6, 7, 19,
23, 31-34] support the idea that ΔNp73 overexpression
may be an important determinant of the clinical response
to chemotherapy and may offer a therapeutic target for
enhancing chemosensitivity in human tumors, including
APL. Of course, in the current scenario, the combination
of ATRA and arsenic trioxide must be tested in ΔNp73expressing cells in order to develop better strategies
for patients who need special care, particularly those
considered high-risk.

Township, NJ, USA). In addition to the MSCV promoter,
the pMEG lentivector harbors the enhanced GFP (EGFP)
gene and the puromycin resistance gene (PURO) under
the control of the constitutive human elongation factor
1α (EF1) promoter. pMEG-lentivector (containing or not
the encoding ΔNp73 gene; 22.5 µg/plate), pCMVΔR8.74
expressing HIV gag/pol, Rev and tat (15 µg/plate), and
pMD2G vector expressing VSV-G (8 µg/plate) were
transfected into five 100 mm culture dishes containing
293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen),
according to manufacturer recommendations. Twentyfour hours later, the fresh lentiviral particle-containing
supernatants were collected, filtered through 0.45-µm
filters (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and used to infect
the target cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Primary BM cell isolation and lentiviral infection

Lentiviral transduction of primary murine bone
marrow cells

We used murine BM cells from healthy and agematched hCG-PML/RARA transgenic mice and their WT
counterparts as the target for lentiviral infection. Briefly,
mice were treated with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil for 5
days, sacrificed, and BM cells obtained by bone crushing.
The cells were pre-stimulated for 48 hours in medium
supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, murine
interleukin-3 (6 ng/ml), murine interleukin-6 (10 ng/ml),
and murine stem cell factor (100 ng/ml) in a humidified
incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Next, the murine BM
cells were infected with empty vector (pMEG) or pMEGΔNp73 lentiviruses for 4 to 6 hours, purified based on the
expression of GFP protein (Supplementary Figure 1B),
and posteriorly used for BM transplantation and in vitro
assays.

Mice
Parental strain mice were bred and maintained
at the Center for Cell Based Therapy Animal Facility.
All experiments using mice were approved by the
Institutional Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee
(protocol number #088/2007) and conducted according to
national guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals.
Cathepsin G-PML/RARA (hCG-PML/RARA) transgenic
mice [24] and their wild-type (WT) counterparts, at 8 to
12 weeks of age, were used as donors of primary BM
for lentiviral infection and subsequent in vitro assays
and BM transplantation. Female NOD/SCID mice, older
than 8 weeks of age, were used as recipients for BM
transplantation model. hCG-PML/RARA transgenic mice
and WT littermates were kindly provided by Dr. Pier
Paolo Pandolﬁ (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Boston, USA). All animals
were housed under specific pathogen free conditions in
individually ventilated cages during the whole experiment
and were maintained according to the Guide for Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research
Council, USA, and to the National Council of Animal
Experiment Control recommendations.

Western blotting and antibodies
Whole-cell lysates were prepared as previously
described [36]. Mouse anti-β-actin (sc-81178) was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody horse anti-mouse IgG (#7076) was
purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA).
Anti-HA (NH2-terminal)-HRP Antibody (R930-25) was
purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The antibody-protein complex was detected using the ECL
Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Lifesciences
Amersham,
Buckinghamshire,
Buckinghamshire,
England).

Lentivirus production
Recombinant lentivirus encoding ΔNp73 gene was
generated using pCDH1-MCS1-EF1-GFP-Puro (pMEG)
(Supplementary Figure 1A) self-inactivating lentivector
(#CD713B-1; System Biosciences, Mountain View,
CA, USA) in 293T cells by following the three-plasmid
packaging procedure as described elsewhere [35]. Briefly,
the cDNA encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged-ΔNp73
was subcloned into Xbal and BamHI sites downstream to
murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter. The complete
sequence of ΔNp73 gene was synthesized and fully
sequenced in both directions by GenScript (Piscataway

In vitro assays
Cell proliferation assay
Cell suspensions containing 1 × 105 cells/mL of
highly purified murine BM cells were seeded in triplicate
in 25cm2 flask. Cell counts were performed daily for
five days. Concomitantly, cell viability was determined
by the Trypan blue dye exclusion method. Growth

curves were drawn according to the number of cells/mL
taking in account the final number of cells/incubation
time. To calculate the cell proliferation only viable cells
were considered. Three independent experiments were
performed for each group of cells.

pMEG-ΔNp73 lentiviruses. Samples were run at the ABI
7500 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The data analysis
was performed in SDS software 2.3 (SABiosciences).
Genes were analyzed using two-way hierarchical cluster
analysis based on the relative expression (2-ΔΔCt) by Ward’s
method (JMP version 10.0.0, SAS Institute).

Cell cycle assay
For the cell cycle analysis, 1 × 106 of highly purified
murine BM cells were cultured in triplicate for 24 hours
using complete medium in a 6-well plate and then were
subjected to immunofluorescent staining of incorporated
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 7-amino-actinomycin
(7-AAD), followed by flow cytometric analysis using the
BrdU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells
were incubated with 10μM of BrdU for 30 minutes, and then
processed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Bone marrow transplantation
A total of 3 × 105 of highly purified murine BM
cells from WT mice and non-leukemic hCG-PML/RARA
mice (containing or not ΔNp73) along with 2 × 105 nontransfected cells of each background were injected into
the lateral tail vein of lethally irradiated (3.5 Gy) NOD/
SCID recipient mice. Recipients were aged older than 8
up to 12-weeks. During the whole experiment, all animals
were maintained under specific pathogen-free environment
in individually ventilated cages and observed for signs of
disease. Sparfloxacin (10 µg/ml) was given into the drinking
water for 2 to 3 weeks after BM transplantation. Viability of
mice was monitored daily. Engraftment of donor cells was
monitored by tail vein bleeds and FACS analysis of GFP
positive cells was performed after 45 days.

Apoptosis assay
For the apoptosis analysis, 5 × 105 of highly
purified murine BM cells were incubated in complete
medium for 24 hours in the presence of vehicle or Ara-C
100µg/ml. The apoptosis rate was determined using the
Annexin V-APC and propidium iodide (PI) binding assay
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and analyzed
by flow cytometry. All experiments were performed in
triplicate and in each sample a minimum of 10 000 events
were acquired in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Flow cytometry
Freshly harvested BM cells from previously
transplanted mice were suspended in phosphatebuffered saline contain 1% fetal bovine serum. The
erythrocytes were lysed by alkaline lysis using AKC
lysis buffer (0.15M NH4Cl, 1mM KHCO3, 0.1mM Na–
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH: 7.4). The nucleated
cells were then stained using fluorescence labeled
antibodies to Gr1, CD11b, B220, CD3, Ter119, CD117,
Sca1, or isotype controls (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
The flow cytometric data were collected using a BD
FACSCalibur, and analyzed using CellQuest Pro software
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Colony-forming cell (CFC) assay
CFCs were assayed in methylcellulose (Methocult
M3434; STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver,
Canada) supplemented with mIL-3 (6 ng/ml), mIL6 (10 ng/ml), and mSCF (100 ng/ml), following the
manufacturer’s recommendations. One thousand viable
cells/dish were plated in triplicate. Colonies were
evaluated microscopically on day 8 after plating by using
standard criteria.
Differentiation assay
Cell suspensions containing 5 × 105 of highly
purified murine BM cells were incubated in complete
medium for seven days in the presence of ATRA
(1μM). The differentiation rate was determined by
immunophenotyping using the percentage of CD11bpositive cells (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) as
maturity marker. All experiments were performed in
triplicate and in each sample a minimum of 10 000 events
were acquired in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis
All calculations were performed using statistical
package for the social sciences (SPSS) 19.0 software
(IBM SPSS software, Chicago, IL, USA). All P-values
were two sided with significance set to 5%.
