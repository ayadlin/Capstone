ABSTRACT
Epidemiological and preclinical studies propose that metformin, a first-line drug
for type-2 diabetes, exerts direct antitumor activity. Although several clinical trials
are ongoing, the molecular mechanisms of this effect are unknown.
Here we show that chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) is a direct target of
metformin in human glioblastoma cells. Metformin exposure induces antiproliferative
effects in cancer stem cell-enriched cultures, isolated from three individual WHO grade
IV human glioblastomas. These effects phenocopy metformin-mediated inhibition of a
chloride current specifically dependent on CLIC1 functional activity. CLIC1 ion channel
is preferentially active during the G1-S transition via transient membrane insertion.
Metformin inhibition of CLIC1 activity induces G1 arrest of glioblastoma stem cells.
This effect was time-dependent, and prolonged treatments caused antiproliferative
effects also for low, clinically significant, metformin concentrations. Furthermore,
substitution of Arg29 in the putative CLIC1 pore region impairs metformin modulation
of channel activity.
The lack of drugs affecting cancer stem cell viability is the main cause of
therapy failure and tumor relapse. We identified CLIC1 not only as a modulator of
cell cycle progression in human glioblastoma stem cells but also as the main target
of metformin’s antiproliferative activity, paving the way for novel and needed
pharmacological approaches to glioblastoma treatment.

INTRODUCTION

cancer cell proliferation, mainly acting on cancer stem
cells (CSCs) [5-10]. On these bases, several clinical trials
are underway [4, 11].
Although metformin was clinically approved
several decades ago, its mechanism of action has not
been completely elucidated. Metformin metabolic effects

Epidemiological studies reported that metformin, a
first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes [1], is associated
with reduced incidence and favorable prognosis in several
cancers [2-4]. Moreover, metformin directly inhibits

mainly rely on mitochondrial activity: it decreases ATP
production and activates AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), thus regulating gluconeogenesis and fatty acid
synthesis [12]. Since AMPK controls mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, metformin’s regulation of
AMPK could also account for its antiproliferative effects
[13, 14].
However, several lines of evidence suggest that
this is not the case. If metformin merely acted as mTOR
inhibitor, it should induce the same tumor resistance
mechanisms as “classical” mTOR blockers (i.e.
rapamycin), such as the relief of the mTOR/S6K1 negative
feedback loop on IGFR-1/IRS-1, the activation of receptor
tyrosine kinase-mediated intracellular pathways [15] and
the loss of antiproliferative activity [16]. In contrast,
epidemiological and preclinical studies suggest that
metformin has long-term antiproliferative effects. Further,
in CSCs isolated from breast and lung carcinomas, or
glioblastoma (GBM) [8, 9, 17-21], metformin-dependent
cell proliferation arrest does not involve AMPK, but rather
the down-regulation of IGF-1 signaling or inhibition of
Akt [17, 22, 23]. Conversely, the synthetic AMPK agonist
A-769662 provided a proliferative advantage to the
cells [21]. On the other hand, metformin was reported to
affect several other intracellular pathways in tumor cells,
including HER1/HER2, Src, S6K1, c-MYC, and STAT3
among others [16, 24-27], being also able to overcome
dietary restriction-resistance in cancer cells [28].
The heterogeneity of the reported mechanisms
of action could imply that metformin is a promiscuous
drug, rather than acting on precise pathways. Conversely,
the broad range of tumors affected by metformin might
suggest that, instead of modulating different pathways in
each cancer histotype, an upstream target could represent
its specific mechanism of action.
In this context, our study aims to identify the
molecular mechanism by which metformin specifically
elicits antitumoral effects without interfering with normal
cell viability.
Chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) [29-31] is
involved in development of the most aggressive human
tumors, including GBMs [32-34]. In resting cells, CLIC1
is mainly localized in the cytosol, but it is progressively
oxidized during cell cycle progression, and transiently
recruited to the plasma-membrane, where it functions
as a chloride selective ion channel [35, 36]. In vivo and
in vitro proliferation of GBM CSCs depends on CLIC1
activity and its inhibition reduces tumor development in
animal models [32], thus, CLIC1 could be a target for
antiproliferative molecules.
Importantly, in vivo studies already demonstrated
that CLIC1 is required for GBM tumorigenesis [32],
and that metformin treatment of mice orthotopically
xenografted with human GBM CSCs, reduced tumor
growth [18], confirming the more copious in vitro results.
On these premises, the goal of this study was to

determine whether CLIC1 is involved in metformin
inhibition of GBM cell proliferation.

RESULTS
Correlation between CLIC1 inhibition and
antiproliferative effect of metformin in
glioblastoma cells
Metformin effects were initially tested in U87
human GBM cell line. We measured the effects of IAA94,
a well-characterized CLIC1 inhibitor [31], prior or
subsequently to the addition of metformin, in perforated
patch clamp whole-cell configuration experiments. In
both cases, the first compound decreased the whole cell
current that was not further reduced by the second one
(Fig. 1A and B). Current/voltage (I/Vs) relationships (Fig.
1C and D) show that the current amplitudes, at different
membrane potentials, are superimposed, suggesting that
the two drugs converge on the same molecular target (Fig.
S1). Metformin EC50, as CLIC1 inhibitor, was 2.1mM
(Fig. 1E), while IAA94 showed EC50 (32µM, Fig. S1D)
similar to previous reports [31].
Outside-out single-channel recordings confirmed
CLIC1 as metformin target on U87 membranes, where
CLIC1 retains single-channel properties, previously
described for outside-out experiments (Fig. S2A and B)
[29]. Metformin perfusion (Fig. 1F, arrow) efficiently
inhibits single channel activity, showing a current
inhibition that lasted for several minutes after washout, being practically irreversible (Fig. S2C), and highly
specific for CLIC1, since 4,4’-diisothiocyanatostilbene2,2’-disulphonic acid (DIDS)-sensitive chloride channels
were unaffected (Fig. S2D).
Inhibition of CLIC1 current by metformin or
IAA94 was associated with time- and dose-dependent
decrease of U87 cell viability, showing maximal efficacy
after 72 hours of treatment (MTT assay; Fig. 1G and
H, Table 1). EC50 values (1.7mM for metformin and
40.5µM for IAA94) are comparable to those obtained in
electrophysiology experiments (see above), suggesting
that the inhibition of CLIC1 activity and the reduction
of cell viability are related events. Metformin efficacy
as antiproliferative agent was also time-dependent since
longer exposure to the drug required lower metformin
concentrations to elicit antitumoral effects (EC50: 23, 6.6
and 1.7mM after 24, 48 and 72 hours).

of tumor cells than established cell lines [37, 38]. We
isolated CSCs from three human GBMs, to test the role
of CLIC1 in the antiproliferative effects of metformin.
These cells were either grown in stem cell-permissive
medium [39] retaining CSC-like features (clonogenicity,
stem cell marker expression, and in vivo tumorigenicity),
or shifted for 14-days in FBS-containing medium to
induce differentiation (Fig. S3A). Differentiation was
demonstrated by increased expression of astrocytic
(GFAP: Fig. 2A and B, and Fig. S4C and E) and neuronal
(βIII-tubulin: Fig. S3B and C) markers, and the parallel
down-regulation of stem cell makers (Nestin, Olig2, and
Sox2: Fig. S3B and C).
CLIC1 was highly expressed in CSC cultures,
but its protein levels were highly down-regulated after
differentiation (Fig. 2A and B, and Fig. S4A, B, C and D).
Metformin dose-dependently reduced CSC viability (EC50:
3.9, 11.3, and 8.0mM for GBM1-3, respectively, after 48
hours of treatment), but failed to induce cytotoxicity in
differentiated cells (Fig. 2C, and Fig. S4F) that resulted
statistically significant only at highest concentration
(40mM), reaching a maximal inhibition <30%, while the

same concentrations almost completely suppress CSC
viability (-76-86% ) (Fig. 2C and Fig. S4F). Similar results
were obtained blocking CLIC1 activity using IAA94 (Fig.
2D, and Fig. S4G). The analysis of DNA synthesis, by
BrdU incorporation assay, confirmed the antiproliferative
activity on CSC by both metformin and IAA94 (Fig. 2E
and F).
The correlation between metformin’s inhibition
of CSC proliferation and CLIC1 functioning, was
corroborated by electrophysiological measurements of
metformin-sensitive CLIC1 current densities that were
negligible in differentiated cells as compared to CSCs
(Fig. 2G, H, I and L).

We knocked-down CLIC1 expression in CSCs by
specific shRNA lentiviral infection (shCLIC1), verified by
immunocytofluorescence (Fig. 3A) and Western blot (Fig.
3B). Metformin inhibited CLIC1 conductance in wt GBM1
CSCs with an EC50 (2.3mM) similar to U87 cells (Fig.
3C). Both IAA94 and metformin reduced CLIC1 current
in control (shLuc)-infected CSCs, while CLIC1-silenced
CSCs showed lack of ionic flow (Fig. 3D). Current/voltage
relationships (Fig. 3E) show, in an average of several
cells, a consistent CLIC1 current in shLuc control cells
(open circles), while in CLIC1-silenced CSCs the average
metformin and IAA94 sensitive currents (open squares)
decline by more than 50%. Furthermore, shCLIC1-CSCs
show lower metformin (and IAA94) cytotoxicity (Fig.
3F), confirming, at molecular level, that CLIC1 mediates
metformin’s antiproliferative effects.
The specificity of metformin antiproliferative effects
towards CSCs [17, 18] was showed demonstrating that
metformin (and IAA94) did not affect human umbilical
cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ucMSC) viability
(Fig. 4A), in agreement with previous studies in which
metformin was reported to exert a trophic activity for
adult stem cells [40]. Differently from GBM CSCs, CLIC1
was not detected in the ucMSC membrane compartment,
where it acts as ion channel, but was confined as inactive
protein within the cytosol (Fig. 4B and C), thus CLIC1

current was negligible (Fig. 4D). These results suggest
that metformin inhibits proliferation only in cells in which
CLIC1 functioning is required for proliferation (i.e. GBM
CSCs) [32], but it spares normal stem cells although these
cells retain CLIC1 expression.

partial arrest in G1, 24 hours after metformin or IAA94
treatment, consistent with DNA synthesis experiments
(Fig. 2E and F). Release of G0/G1 synchronized cells
(about 92% of cells in G0/G1) allowed a synchronous reentry in the cell cycle, mostly evident after 24 hours, that
was abolished in the presence of metformin or IAA94.
Finally, cells released from nocodazole treatment (55%
of cells in G2/M) after 6 hours progressed to G1 in the
presence of metformin and IAA94, similarly to untreated
cells. However, after 24 hours, while untreated cells
continued to S phase, almost 80% of metformin/IAA94treated cells were blocked in G1 (Fig. 5A). The G1-S
transition is therefore the target of both metformin and
IAA94’s antiproliferative effects. Consistently, 24 hour
treatment with metformin (or IAA94) of randomly cycling
GBM CSCs, decreased both retinoblastoma protein (Rb)
content and its phosphorylation status (Fig. 5B).

Inhibition of G1-S transition as metformin’s
antiproliferative mechanism
CLIC1 translocates to the membrane following
an increase in cytosolic oxidative state [35, 41, 42]
corresponding to a peak of ROS during G1-S transition
[43]. Thus, CSCs were synchronized by growth factor
starvation (60 hours), to accumulate cells in G0/G1, and
nocodazole/cytochalasin B treatment, to freeze cells in
G2/M, and cell cycle evaluated by FACS. After the relief of
cell cycle arrest and administration of metformin, IAA94,
or vehicle (Fig. 5A), randomly cycling cells showed a

analysis for cell cycle progression after propidium iodide staining (n=2). Control, metformin (10 mM)- or IAA94 (100 µM)-treated cells
were analysed after 6 and 24 hours without synchronisation (randomly cycling, upper panels), after G0/G1 arrest (induced by 60 hours of
growth factor deprivation, middle panels) or after blockade induced by nocodazole/cytochalasin B treatment (overnight incubation with
50 ng/mL nocodazole + 25 ng/mL cytochalasin B, lower panels). At experimental time 0 (depicted in the original histograms from the
FACS on the left, and in the first superimposed bars), randomly cycling cells show the following cell cycle distribution: G0/G1= 59.25%;
S=33.75%; G2/M=7%; starvation induced a clear G0/G1 synchronisation (91.88% of the cells, with only 5.12 and 3% in phase S and G2/M,
respectively); nocodazole treatment caused cell accumulation in G2/M (55.49%) with 29.64% of the cells in G0/G1 and 14.87% in S phase.
Cells were subsequently shifted into standard growth factor-containing CSC medium and allowed to grow for 6 or 24 hours. Treatment
with both metformin and IAA94 caused a strong reduction of cell cycle progression that was mainly due to the blockade of G1-S transition.
B) Western blot analysis of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in metformin- and IAA94-treated CSCs. Metformin (10 mM) and IAA94 (100
µM) affects Rb protein expression and phosphorylation status in GBM1 CSCs. Treatment with either drug not only drastically reduced Rb
protein content, but also led to a higher prevalence of non-phosphorylated protein in treated cell extracts compared to control conditions.
Thus, metformin- and IAA94-induced cell cycle arrest correlates with a reduction of Rb content and a shift towards the non-phosphorylated
form. Representative Western blot is reported in the left panel, and the quantification by densitometric analysis of two replica experiments
is depicted in the right panel (***p<0.001, t-test).

Metformin inhibition of CLIC1 is use-dependent
and it is lost in CLIC1 mutants lacking Arg29
within the channel pore

In this and previous reports, metformin antitumor
effects occur at concentrations in the millimolar range (150mM) [8, 9, 25, 44]. Such high concentrations however,
although referred as “oncobiguanides” treatments [45],
were often questioned as far as the in vivo significance
of these effects. Nevertheless, the lack of toxicity in
differentiated GBM cells and in ucMSCs, as demonstrated
in our study, argues against a non-specific in vitro
effect. In addition, prolonged treatment with equimolar
concentration of arginine did not reduce CSC viability
(Fig. S5), indirectly confirming that the observed effects
are specific for metformin.

The direct metformin interaction with CLIC1 was
tested in CHO cells transfected with wild type (wt) and
mutant CLIC1. In CLIC1 wt-transfected cells, whole-cell
electrophysiology recordings show a slow (few minutes)
metformin inhibition of chloride current (Fig. 6A and B),
similar to what observed in GBM cells. This kinetics was
explained as an activity-dependent inhibition of CLIC1
current due to a direct interaction with the channel. Indeed,
CLIC1 inhibition by metformin was dependent on the
frequency of stimulation (Fig. 6C, D and E), suggesting
that metformin binds CLIC1 only in the open state.
Fig. 6: CLIC1 current inhibition by metformin is use-

dependent. A) Time-course of whole-cell currents in CHO
cells transfected with human wt CLIC1, and stimulated every 5
seconds with 800 ms, 100 mV test potential from -40 mV holding
voltage. Each point represents the average current of the last 100
ms of a single current trace. Once the current amplitude reached
a constant value, the cell was challenged with 10mM metformin.
At a new steady-state the cell was perfused with 100µM IAA94
that was used to completely block CLIC1 conductance. B) Doseresponse curve built perfusing cells with different metformin
concentrations (0.05-50 mM) followed by IAA94 (100µM).
Each point is the average result of 5 measurements. C) Examples
of metformin (10mM) inhibition kinetics in three different
experiments in which cells were stimulated with voltage steps
delivered every 10, 5 or 2.5 seconds. D-E) Negative slope
portions of several experiments, as in panel C, at different
stimulation frequencies were normalised as percentages of
the maximum current value of each trial. Average inhibition
time-courses at stimulation frequencies 0.1 (squares; n=7), 0.2
(circles; n=9), and 0.4 Hz (triangles; n=8) were plotted and fitted
with a linear regression function (D). Calculated slopes of the
average inhibition of time-course currents (0.1 Hz= -0.231±0.01;
0.2 Hz= -0.577±0.01; 0.4 Hz= -1.052±0.02) are coincident
with the average result obtained by plotting single-experiment
metformin inhibitory slopes in a box-plot (E). Higher frequency
stimulation induces faster inhibition of the current. The

Importantly, our data provide a mechanistic
interpretation for the apparent incongruence between
in vitro effective concentrations and in vivo achievable
drug levels. According to our results (Fig. 4), metformin
acts only when CLIC1 is active in the membrane. Given
the short timing of channel activity, the limited number
of CLIC1 molecules present on the membrane, and the
relatively low open channel probability [41], the chance
to find an open CLIC1 channel in the membrane during
the G1-S transition is very low. In acute electrophysiology
experiments or short-time cell viability experiments, being
CLIC1 inhibition by metformin practically irreversible,

only high concentrations of metformin (i.e. 10mM) can
inhibit a significant percentage of active channels to obtain
inhibition of cell proliferation. Thus, the antiproliferative
effects are not only strongly dependent on metformin
concentrations but also on the duration of treatment,
considering that in clinical trials prolonged (weeks or
months) in vivo treatments are performed [46].
Accordingly, high frequency stimulation (in which
more open channels are simultaneously available to
metformin) or longer exposure to the drug (in which a
prolonged inhibition progressively blocks the activity
of all CLIC1 pools that reach cell membrane during cell

Currents from transfected CLIC1 constructs are functionally
identified using anti-FLAG antibody acting as current blocker

show partial inhibition of membrane current by anti-FLAG
antibody while the remaining current, representing endogenous
CLIC1, was blocked by both metformin (10mM) and IAA94
(100µM). G-H) Metformin induces a total membrane current
knockdown in CLIC1 wt-transfected cells, without a further

cycle progression) induced significant effects using lower
in vitro metformin concentrations.
Metformin (200-1000µM) significantly inhibited
CSC CLIC1 current during high frequency stimulation
(1Hz, Fig. 6F and G). Furthermore, in accordance with
data using U87 cells (Fig. 1G), prolonged treatment (up
to 15 days) with low doses of metformin (10-300µM)
significantly reduced CSC viability (Fig. 6H), displaying
a precise inverse relationship between treatment duration
and the concentration required to reduce CSC viability (i.e.
10-30µM metformin are sufficient to elicit an effect after
15 days, while 50 and 100µM required 10 and 7 days).
Experimental data suggest that the pore formed
by CLIC1 has a single, 22 amino acids, transmembrane
(TM) domain [29, 30, 35, 42, 47]. FRET data [42, 47]
showed that TM segment forms an amphipathic α-helix
where the only charged residues are Arg29 and Lys37.
CLIC1 channel conformation is likely to be an oligomer
of 7±1 monomers [42], similar to viroporin, formed by
oligomerization of a single TM helix [48, 49], in which
multiple copies (7±1) of Arg29 and Lys37 line the anion
path. Arg29 is likely to be near the mouth of the pore
at the cell surface, while Lys37 is in the middle of the
TM region. Consistent with this model, R29A and K37A
mutations alter CLIC1 biophysical parameters [41]: Arg29
destabilizes the closed state of the channel and the R29A
mutation results in a closed channel that only opens at
positive membrane potential (away from the chloride
reversal potential) [41]. Arg29 and/or Lys37 may therefore
form part of the metformin binding site [35, 42]. Thus, we
substituted each of them with alanine (R29A and K37A)
[41], and measured metformin’s effects on CLIC1 currents
in transfected CHO cells.
Metformin significantly inhibited membrane current
in CLIC1 wt and K37A-transfected cells (Fig. 7A and D),
but only partially in R29A-transfected cells (Fig. 7B).
Conversely, similar IAA94 dose-response curves were
observed in CLIC1 wt- and R29A-expressing cells (Fig.
7C).
CLIC1 current in transfected CHO cells derives
from a mixture of endogenous and transfected proteins.
The current induced by the transfected protein is
easily distinguishable from the endogenous one, since
transfected channels are FLAG-tagged, and anti-FLAG
antibody acts as channel blocker [29, 31]. Both wt- and
R29A-expressing cells showed part of IAA94-sensitive
current blocked by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7E and
F). Metformin completely abolished IAA94-sensitive
membrane current in CLIC1-wt cells, with no further
decrease observed in presence of the anti-FLAG antibody
(Fig. 7G). Conversely, in R29A-transfected cells, after
partial current inhibition by metformin, anti-FLAG
antibody further decreased membrane current (Fig.
7H). Average results (reported in Fig. 7I) support R29
requirement for metformin inhibition of CLIC1.
Outside-out single-channel experiments further
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

confirmed that metformin directly acts on CLIC1 wt
from the external side (Fig. 8A) but failed to shut-down
single channels in CLIC1 R29A-transfected cells (Fig.
8B). Accordingly, metformin was unable to inhibit CLIC1
single channel current in inside-out trials (Fig. 8C).

DISCUSSION
Drug repositioning represents a growing field in
pharmacology research, opening in the last few years,
unexpected, yet promising, novel approaches in particular
for anti-cancer purposes [6, 50-53]
The crucial message coming out from our
study is the identification of a molecular target for the
antiproliferative activity of metformin in human GBM
CSCs. Recently, several studies reported the in vitro and
in vivo efficacy of metformin as antitumoral agent for
most human tumors, including GBM [17, 18], showing its
efficacy in reducing proliferation, survival, clonogenicity
and in vivo tumorigenicity of CSC subpopulations. While
these studies opened the way to ongoing clinical trials [2,
54], in most cases, they did not address two central issues:

Fig. 8: Molecular characterization of CLIC1 activity

modulation by metformin A) Outside-out single channel
experiments in native CHO cells show that anti-FLAG antibody
does not inhibit CLIC1 current, differently from metformin
(10mM) that closes the channel (single wt channel in control
conditions Popen= 0.2±0.01, n=3 total of 6 minutes continuous
recording). B) CLIC1 R29A, transfected in CHO cells, is
insensitive to metformin, but it is promptly blocked by antiFLAG antibody (single R29A channel in control conditions
Popen=0.21±0.008, n=3 total of 7 minutes continuous recording).
C) Inside-out single channel experiments show that metformin
fails to inhibit CLIC1 channel opening after more than 30
seconds of continuous recording (single wt channel in control
conditions Popen= 0.26±0.02, n=3 total of 10 minutes continuous
recording).

(i) the molecular mechanism by which metformin reduces
tumor development and growth (considering that, at odds
with the initial reports, most studies are now showing that
AMPK activation is not the main player in this effect [1921]), and (ii) the mechanisms for metformin selectivity
towards cancer cells, a rather unique characteristic for
antitumoral drugs, but also demonstrated by the absence
of significant toxicity of metformin when chronically used
in diabetic patients.
The goal of our study was to provide answers to
these questions, using CSC cultures, a reliable in vitro
model of human GBM [38]. We propose CLIC1, a
transiently active chloride channel previously identified as
a requirement for GBM growth in vivo and in vitro [32],
to be the molecular target of metformin activity. We show
that metformin targets CLIC1 “functional expression” only
when the protein translocates to the plasma-membrane
where it acts as chloride conductive pore to allow the G1-S
transition of the cells. Conversely, neither metformin nor
IAA94 (a selective CLIC1 inhibitor) reduce proliferation
of differentiated GBM cells or ucMSCs, in which CLIC1
is similarly expressed but confined to the cytosol in an
inactive conformation. Thus, the different activity and
availability of CLIC1 as active chloride channel in
normal and tumoral cells, dictates the strict selectivity of
metformin towards CSCs. The specificity of metformin’s
effects is corroborated by the observation that in diabetic
patients and in experimental studies, chronic metformin
treatment is not toxic to normal stem cells [55, 56], in

contrast with mTOR inhibitors [55]. The observations that
CLIC1 chloride current is essential for human GBM CSC
proliferation [32] and that metformin preferentially affects
CSC viability [17] support this assumption.
The transient functional activation of CLIC1 during
mitosis in CSCs allows metformin to act as a selective
CLIC1 inhibitor to slow-down cell cycle progression.
Importantly, metformin time-dependent efficacy
highlighted in this study might reconcile the different
concentrations required to affect tumor proliferation in
vitro and in vivo, with prolonged in vivo treatments likely
being effective also with lower, clinically reachable,
metformin concentrations. Moreover, the experiments
using CLIC1 mutants, here reported, provided clues for
the mechanism of the metformin-CLIC1 interaction. We
demonstrate that metformin interacts with CLIC1 from
the external side of the membrane at the amino terminus
of the channel, presumably near the side chain of Arg29,
which is responsible for destabilizing the closed state of
the channel. These data allowed us to build a conceptual
model for metformin’s action. Arg29 is likely to be near
the anion path proximal to the extracellular surface. As it
destabilizes the closed state of the channel, it could interact
with a polar portion of the channel via its guanidinium
moiety (Fig. 9A). Using its double guanidinium group,
metformin may displace the side chain of Arg29 from
this polar pocket, stabilizing the closed state and possibly
obstructing the channel pore displacing the large arginine
side chain (Fig. 9B). Metformin can only access this polar

of CLIC1 wt, while it has no effect on R29A mutant. A) In the closed state of CLIC1 wt, the side chain of Arg29 makes an interaction that
destabilizes the closed state. This facilitates the opening of the channel near the chloride reversal potential. B) Metformin displaces the
guanidinium moiety of Arg29, stabilizing the closed state. In addition, the displaced Arg29 side chain may obstruct the channel pore. C)
In the R29A mutant, the closed state is stable near the chloride reversal potential, as there is no Arg29 side chain to make the destabilizing
interaction as it is replaced by Ala29. D) Metformin is free to bind to the guanidinium site in R29A, as it is unoccupied. It has no effect on
channel opening at high membrane potentials.

site from the outside of the cell, as the binding site is near
to the cell surface, given the position of Arg29 in the TM
segment (consistent with the lack of effects in inside-out
electrophysiology experiments). In contrast, CLIC1R29A, lacking Arg29 side chain, displays a more stable
closed state, only opening at high membrane potential
(Fig. 9C). The polar binding pocket (normally occupied
by the guanidinium moiety of Arg29) is exposed and free
to bind metformin (Fig. 9D). However, metformin binding
has no effect on the electrophysiological properties of the
Arg29-lacking mutant, as there is no arginine side chain to
displace to cause channel inhibition.
The observation that metformin effects in GBM
CSCs may occur through an interaction on CLIC1
Arg29 from the external side on cell membrane (see
single channel recordings reported in Fig 8C) suggests
that metformin antiproliferative activity in GBM CSCs
is, at least partially, independent from its intracellular
accumulation. However, comparing the effects of
metformin and IAA94 (a “pure” CLIC1 inhibitor) some
differences in efficacy and cell sensitivity are apparent in
GBM cells (see cell viability and cell cycle data). This
discrepancy highlights the possibility that additional
cellular effects could be induced by metformin but not by
IAA94. In fact, although several of the previously reported
effects of metformin in cancer cells could be reconciled
with the cell cycle regulation induced by CLIC1
inhibition (i.e. modulation of kinase systems that control
proliferation and/or survival [17, 22, 24], or the activation
of transcription factors [26, 27]), recent data also reported
a direct effect of this drug on complex I and oxidative
phosphorylation, which, besides being responsible
for its metabolic effects, could also interfere with cell
proliferation [54, 57]. In particular, due to the avid glucose
consumption as energy source for cancer cells, metformin
antiproliferative effects were also reported to be mediated
by alteration of cancer cell glucose metabolism via a
direct inhibition of hexokinase II and its dissociation from
mitochondria, to form an inactive cytosolic complex with
metformin [58, 59]. As a consequence, glucose availability
may also modulate cancer cell sensitivity to metformin
[60, 61]. Thus, both metabolic (glucose metabolism) and
transductional (CLIC1 inhibition) effects may account for
synergistic antiproliferative effects of metformin.
The intracellular cascade activated by CLIC1 (and
inhibited by metformin) responsible for CSC proliferation
is still to be elucidated. From previous studies several
possibilities could be considered including an oxidative
environment generated on a rapid time-scale, which
facilitates the progression of mitosis [43], CLIC1
interaction with the cytoskeleton [62] and regulation of
cell volume [63], which may ultimately affect cell viability
via intracellular kinases [17].
In conclusion, metformin, whose ability to cross the
blood-brain barrier was reported [18, 64], could represent
a valuable therapeutic tool for GBM, due to its negligible
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

side-effects, easy delivery, and low cost. Future clinical
trials are required to definitely demonstrate metformin
in vivo efficacy, although its time-dependent, low dose
efficacy represents a good starting point to translate
these results to the clinics. In addition, CLIC1 is a novel
pharmacological target for newly designed drugs due
to its accessibility from outside the cell and transient
appearance in the membrane only during deregulated cell
cycle progression.

Human GBM CSC and ucMSC cultures
GBM CSC cultures were obtained from 2 females
and 1 male patients (67, 40 and 71 years old, respectively)
and coded as GBM1, GBM2, GBM3. Post-surgical
samples were used after patients’ informed consent and
Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC) approval. All
patients underwent surgery at Neurosurgery Department

therapy prior to the intervention. Specimens were
histologically classified as GBM grade IV (WHO
classification).
CSCs, isolated as described [65, 66], were grown
in stem cell-permissive medium enriched with 10ng/
ml human bFGF and 20ng/ml human EGF [39]. Sphere
formation occurred within 2 weeks of culture (Fig. S3).
CSCs were also grown as monolayer on growth factorreduced Matrigel coating (BD Biosciences), allowing
easier evaluation of viability experiments without affecting
stem cell features [65]. Validation of CSC properties of
the cultures (i.e. self-renewal capacity, stem cell marker
expression, multipotency, and tumorigenicity), was
performed as described [17](see Fig. S3). Tumorigenicity
was assessed in 6-8-week-old NOD-SCID mice (Charles

Gene silencing
Short hairpins mRNA specific for human CLIC1
(5’-GATGATGAGGAGATCGAGCTC-3’) and firefly
luciferase (5’-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3’) were
cloned into the XhoI/HpaI sites of the pLentiLox 3.7
lentiviral vector [32] and stably expressed in GBM CSCs.

Western blot
Whole cell lysates were obtained using a
buffer containing 1% Igepal, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF (all from Sigma-Aldrich),
and the “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)
for 10 min at 4°C and proteins quantified using the
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Segrate MI, Italy).
Membrane/cytoplasm fractions were obtained using the
“Membrane protein extraction kit” (Thermo Scientific),
following the manufacturer’s instructions. For Western
blot experiments, proteins (20-60 μg) were resuspended
in Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8,
0.01% bromophenol blue, 1.43 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
0.1% glycerol), subjected to 10-12.5% SDS-PAGE,
electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) and probed with specific
antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected using a
chemiluminescence system (Immobilon, Millipore), and
the ChemiDoc XRS apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories), as
reported [69].

Cell lines and transfections
U87-MG and Chinese Hamster Ovary-K1 (CHO)
were from Interlab Cell Line Collection (ICLC, Genova,
Italy) and grown following standard conditions. Both
cell lines were validated by ICLC. CLIC1 wt, R29A, and
K37A mutants, tagged with FLAG peptide, were stably
expressed in CHO cells using FuGENE Reagent (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) [30].

Electrophysiology
Patch electrodes (GB150F-8P with filament, Science
Products) were pulled from hard borosilicate glass
on a Brown-Flaming P-87 puller (Sutter Instruments,
Novato, USA) and fire-polished to a tip diameter of
1-1.5µm and an electrical resistance of 5-7 MΩ. Patchclamp electrophysiology was performed in whole cell,
perforated-patch whole cell, and single channel outsideout and inside-out configurations, as reported [32]. Single
channel experiments were performed as previously
described [41].

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were repeated at least twice
(quantitative data were collected from experiments
performed in triplicate or quadruplicate), and expressed
as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analyses and EC50 values,
calculated using nonlinear regression curve fit analysis
selecting the log(drug) vs. response-variable slope (four
parameters) equation were done using Prism version 5.02
(GraphPad San Diego CA, USA). Statistical significance
between groups was assessed by t-test (unpaired, twotailed) or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
multiple comparison post-test or Tukey tests. Statistical
significance was established at p values <0.05.

Cell proliferation assays
Mitochondrial function, as index of cell
viability, was evaluated by measuring the reduction of
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) as reported [67].
DNA synthesis was evaluated by the measurement
of 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in
replicating DNA (Cell proliferation ELISA, Roche),
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were synchronised
by growth factor starvation (60 hours), or nocodazole
treatment (overnight incubation with nocodazole (50ng/
mL)-cytochalasin B (25ng/mL), in DMEM). Randomly
cycling and synchronised cells were treated in stem cellwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
