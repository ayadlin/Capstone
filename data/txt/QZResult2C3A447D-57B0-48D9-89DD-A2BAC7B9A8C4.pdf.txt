Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165b is a COOHterminal splice variant of VEGF-A that has been implicated
in negative regulation of angiogenesis. We compared the
properties of VEGF-A165b with those of VEGF-A121, VEGFA145, and VEGF-A165. Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in VEGFR-2 differed between the VEGF ligands as
determined by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and by use
of phosphosite-specific antibodies. VEGF-A165b was considerably poorer in inducing phosphorylation of the positive
regulatory site Y1052 in VEGFR-2. Whereas this did not affect
activation of VEGFR-2 in vitro, we show that VEGF-A165b
failed to induce vasculogenesis and sprouting angiogenesis
in differentiating embryonic stem cells and vascularization
of s.c. Matrigel plugs. In addition, the ability of the different
VEGF ligands to induce angiogenesis correlated with their
abilities to bind the VEGF coreceptor neuropilin 1 (NRP1).
Our data indicate that loss of VEGFR-2/NRP1 complex
formation and Y1052 phosphorylation contribute to the lack
of angiogenic properties of VEGF-A165b. [Cancer Res 2008;

Introduction
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a potent
regulator of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis (1). VEGF
belongs to the cysteine-knot family of growth factors, which also
includes platelet-derived growth factors and stem cell factor.
Structurally, VEGF-A is composed of two identical polypeptide
chains oriented in an antiparallel manner (2). The vegf-a gene
encompasses eight exons that are alternatively spliced to create
isoforms designated according to their number of amino acid
residues (such as VEGF-A121, VEGF-A145, and VEGF-A165; ref. 3).
VEGF-A165b is an endogenous COOH-terminal splice variant
identified in 2002 (4). VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A165b are structurally
identical except for the unique COOH-terminal sequence of six
amino acid residues, CDKPRR in VEGF-A165 compared with
SLTRKD in VEGF-A165b, encoded by alternative exons 8a and 8b.

The VEGF-A isoforms bind with high affinity to two related
receptor tyrosine kinases denoted VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 and
VEGFR-2 (5). VEGFR-1 is expressed on circulating hematopoietic
cells as well as on endothelial cells, whereas VEGFR-2 is expressed
on circulating endothelial precursors and on mature endothelial
cells. Inactivation of a single vegf-a allele in mice results in early
lethality at embryonic day (E)11-12 due to deficient endothelial
cell development and lack of vessels (6, 7). Vegfr-2 / animals die
at E8.5 with a phenotype similar to that of vegf-a / animals (8).
VEGFR-2 is therefore regarded as a main transducer of VEGF
biology in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (5).
In addition to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, endothelial cells express
VEGF coreceptors, neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and heparan sulfate
proteoglycan (HSPG), which interact with the VEGF-A isoforms
to different extents. HSPGs bind to VEGF-A through exons 6 and 7,
and NRP1 through exon 7 (see ref. 9 for a review). Exon 8 has also
been implicated in NRP1 binding (10). HSPGs are transmembrane,
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, or secreted proteins with
covalently linked HS chains, which stabilize the ligand/receptor
complex and thereby modulate the activity of secreted growth
factors (11). Expression of HS on endothelial cells is critical for
VEGF responsiveness (12). We have previously described that
presentation of VEGF-A by HS expressed by an adjacent cell, rather
than by the endothelial cell itself, leads to prolonged half-life of
the VEGFR-2 signaling complex (13). NRP1 is a transmembrane
glycoprotein with a short cytoplasmic domain that lacks intrinsic
catalytic activity. NRP1 was first identified as a receptor for class 3
semaphorins, a family of soluble molecules engaged in neuronal
guidance (14, 15), and subsequently, NRP1 was found to bind
VEGF-A as well (16). Targeted inactivation of the mouse nrp1 gene
leads to severe defects in both neuronal and vascular development
and embryonic lethality around E12.5 (17).
VEGF-A165b has been reported to bind VEGFR-2 with the same
affinity as VEGF-A165, but still, it lacks angiogenic properties.
Moreover, through as yet unknown mechanisms, VEGF-A165b
blocks the ability of VEGF-A165 to induce angiogenesis. Several
in vivo responses to VEGF-A165 are blocked by VEGF-A165b, such
as vascularization in the rabbit cornea, the rat mesentery, the
chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane, and xenotransplanted
cancer cells in mice (4, 18, 19–21). In the present study, we have
determined the mechanism of loss of function of VEGF-A165b. For
this purpose, we have compared its effect with that of other VEGF
isoforms with regard to its ability to engage VEGF coreceptors, to
induce vessel formation in vitro and in vivo, and to induce various
VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation sites. We find many similarities
between VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165b; both lack NRP1-binding
ability and fail to induce endothelial cell organization into vessel
structures in embryoid bodies (EB) and in s.c. Matrigel plugs.
An important distinctive feature of VEGF-A165b is its markedly

reduced ability to induce phosphorylation of positive regulatory
tyrosine residues in VEGFR-2.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and growth factors. The following antibodies were used:
anti-NRP1 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-human VEGFR-2 (R&D
Systems), anti-phosphorylated VEGFR-2/3 (against phosphorylated Y1054/
Y1059; Merck), phosphorylated VEGFR-2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb;
against phosphorylated Y1175; 19A10; Cell Signaling Technology), and
phosphorylated VEGFR-2 rabbit mAb (against phosphorylated Y1212; 11A3;
Cell Signaling Technology). IRDye 800–conjugated affinity-purified anti-goat
IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals), mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked whole antibody
(Amersham Biosciences), anti-goat IgG-peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), Alexa
Fluor 680 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Rabbit antiserum (RS-2) were
raised against the kinase insert domain of rat VEGFR-2. It cross-reacts
efficiently with the human VEGFR-2 (22).
VEGF-A165 was from PeproTech EC Ltd., VEGF-A121 was from R&D
Systems, and VEGF-A145 was from Relia-Tech. VEGF-A165b was produced
as described (23).
Tissue culture. Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE)/VEGFR-2 cells have
been described before (24). PAE/NRP1 cells (16) were kindly provided by
Dr. Michael Klagsbrun (Vascular Biology Program/Department of Surgery,
Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). PAE/VEGFR2 and NRP1 cells were established by transfection of PAE/VEGFR-2 cells
with human NRP1 cDNA in pcDNA3.1 (a kind gift from Dr. Michael
Klagsbrun) mixed with pSuper.retro.puro (OligoEngine) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Telomerase-immortalized dermal microvascular (TIME)
cells, a kind gift from Dr. Martin McMahon (Cancer Research Institute,
University of California, San Francisco, CA), and human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC), purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection, were cultured on gelatinized tissue culture dishes in endothelial
basal medium MV2 with growth supplements (PromoCell). Mouse aortic
endothelial (MAE) cells were a kind gift from Dr. Lars Holmgren (Cancer
Center Karolinska, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). MAE/VEGFR2 cells were established by infection of MAE cells with lentivirus encoding
mouse VEGFR-2 (see ref. 25 for creation of VEGFR-2 lentivirus). R1/SVJ 129
murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Andras Nagy
(Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto,
Ontario, Canada).
Competitive binding assay. Subconfluent, serum-starved cells in
24-well plates were incubated for 2 h on ice with 0.1 ACi/mL 125I-VEGFA165 (Amersham Biosciences) with or without 1- to 1,000-fold concentration of nonlabeled competitor in triplicate conditions. Cells were washed
and lysed in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and 10%
glycerol, and cell-bound radioactivity was determined. Data are presented
as mean F SD.
Filter binding assay. HS was purified from PAE/VEGFR-2 cells
metabolically labeled with [35S]radionuclide (Perkin-Elmer). Triplicate samples of 26.2 nmol/L of each VEGF ligand were incubated with
6,000 cpm [35S]HS in 200 AL PBS for 15 min and passed through a
nitrocellulose filter using a multiwell vacuum-assisted filtration apparatus.
After eliminating unbound [35S]HS, filters were incubated in 2 mol/L NaCl
to dissociate the HS from the filter. The radioactivity of protein-bound
[35S]HS was determined using a Wallac 1414 liquid scintillation counter
(Perkin-Elmer).
Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in 1% NP40
and processed for immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting as described
before (24). Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to
nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences) or polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Immobilon-FL, Millipore), blocked in 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA)/PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, followed by incubation with
primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS, 0.2%
Tween 20. Blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and
exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For fluorescent

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

blotting, samples were blocked in Blocking buffer (LI-COR) and incubated
with primary and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies in 0.2%
Tween 20/Blocking buffer. Fluorescence was scanned using an Odyssey IR
imaging system (LI-COR). Densitometric analysis of fluorographs was
performed using the ImageJ 1.31 software.3
Chemotaxis assay. Boyden chamber migration assays were performed
as previously described (24). Serum-starved cells were applied to the upper
wells of the chemotaxis chamber at 25,000 per well and allowed to migrate
through collagen-coated 8-Am pore polycarbonate filters (Whatman)
toward the lower wells, filled with 0 to 30 nmol/L of the different ligands.
Five hours later, migrating cells were fixed in methanol and stained with
Giemsa. The number of migrating cells was determined using the Easy
Image Analysis software (Rainfall). Samples were analyzed in at least six
wells per condition at repeated occasions. Data are shown as mean F SD.
DNA synthesis assay. [3H]Thymidine incorporation assay was performed as described before (24). TIME cells were plated on gelatin-coated
24-well dishes in triplicate samples and incubated with 10 to 1,000 pmol/L
VEGF-A ligands for 16 h. [Methyl-3H]thymidine (1 ACi/mL; Amersham
Biosciences) was added and cells were incubated for additional 6 h. Cells
were washed with PBS on ice and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for
20 min to precipitate DNA. After rinsing with 99% ethanol, precipitated
DNA was solubilized in 0.2 mol/L NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was
measured in a Wallac 1414 liquid scintillation counter. Data are shown as
mean F SD.
Peroxidase/immunofluorescent staining of EBs. ES cells were
induced to differentiate by omitting leukemia inhibitory factor from the
medium and aggregated in hanging drops to create EBs (26). For peroxidase
staining, EBs in two-dimensional cultures (i.e., on glass culture slides) were
fixed in zinc fix solution [0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mmol/L calcium
acetate, 23 mmol/L zinc acetate, 37 mmol/L zinc chloride, containing 0.2%
Triton X-100], treated with 3% H2O2 to suppress endogenous peroxidase
activity, and blocked in TBS/0.1% Tween 20/3% BSA (BSA/TBS-t). Samples
were incubated with primary rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD
Biosciences) and biotinylated anti-rat IgG (Vector Laboratories) in BSA/
TBS-t followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Vector
Laboratories) and the chromogen substance (AEC Substrate Kit For
Peroxidase, Vector Laboratories). Mounting was done using Ultramount
aqueous permanent mounting medium (Dako). For fluorescent staining,
three-dimensional cultured EBs (i.e., in a three-dimensional collagen gel)
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/TBS, blocked, and permeabilized in
TBS/0.2% Triton X-100/3% BSA. Samples were incubated with primary rat
anti-mouse CD31 antibody and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rat IgG
(Invitrogen) in BSA/TBS-t and inspected using either a Nikon Eclipse
E1000 microscope with a Nikon Eclipse DXM 1200 camera (Nikon).
Matrigel plug assay. Animal work was approved by the Uppsala
university board of animal experimentation. Six-week-old female nude mice
were anesthetized using isoflurane (Forene, Abbott) and s.c. injected with
350 AL Matrigel (BD Biosciences) supplemented with sphingosine-1phosphate (S1P, Avanti Polar Lipids) with or without 130 nmol/L VEGF-A
ligands. Mice were euthanized 7 d later and Matrigel plugs were retrieved
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by whole mount staining. The
angiogenic response was detected by immunostaining using rat anti-mouse
CD31 and mouse monoclonal anti-a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)-FITC
conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594
donkey anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM
510 META confocal microscope. For each condition, three to six Matrigel
plugs were inspected at two independent occasions. Vessel branch points
were marked and counted manually (n = 5 for each condition). Data are
shown as mean F SD.
Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. MAE/VEGFR-2 cells
were serum starved and pretreated with 5 Ag/mL anti-VEGF antibody
(R&D Systems) in 0.1% BSA/Ham’s F-12 medium overnight to block
endogenous VEGF-A. Cells were washed and then stimulated with 3 nmol/L
VEGF-A ligands for 5 min and processed for immunoprecipitation with

P-labeled phosphorylated VEGFR-2 (pVEGFR-2) was separated by SDSPAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed
using a Bio-Imager BAS-1800II (Fujifilm). The phosphorylated receptor
bands were excised and blocked with 0.5% polyvinyl pyrrolidone/0.1 mol/L
acetic acid followed by digestion with trypsin (Promega) and oxidation with
performic acid. Tryptic peptides were applied to cellulose TLC plates
(Merck) for two-dimensional separation, electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer
(2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid) using a Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis apparatus (C.B.S. Scientific) for 40 min at 2,000 V, and ascending chromatography in isobutyric acid buffer (62.5% isobutyric acid, 1.9%
n-butyl alcohol, 4.8% pyridine, and 2.9% acetic acid) overnight. The
radioactivity of separated 32P-labeled peptides was analyzed using the
Bio-Imager equipment.

Results
Binding of VEGF-A165, VEGF-A165b, VEGF-A121, and VEGFA145 to VEGFR-2, NRP1, and HS. To determine the properties of
VEGF-A165b, we compared the abilities of the different VEGF
isoforms, VEGF-A165, VEGF-A165b, VEGF-A145, and VEGF-A121,

to interact with VEGFR-2 and the coreceptors NRP1 and HS. As a
model, we used PAE cells. PAE cells lack endogenous expression of
both VEGFR-2 and NRP1 (16, 22) but were stably transfected to
express the human VEGFR-2 alone or VEGFR-2 together with
NRP1. Figure 1A shows immunoblotting to detect expression of
VEGFR-2 and NRP1 in the different PAE cells. Parallel immunoblotting of primary HUVECs showed comparable expression levels
in the transfected PAE cells and the primary endothelial cells,
although the PAE/VEGFR-2, NRP1 cells expressed higher levels of
NRP1 than did HUVECs. Interactions of ligands with VEGFR-2 and
NRP1 were analyzed through competition assays using 125I-VEGFA165 for binding to different PAE cell lines. Untransfected PAE cells
bound only low levels of 125 I-VEGF-A165 in a manner
that could not be competed out by unlabeled VEGF-A165 (data
not shown), in agreement with that these cells express neither
VEGFR-2 nor NRP1 endogenously (16, 22, 28).
All tested VEGF-A ligands, including VEGF-A165b, competed for
binding of 125I-VEGF-A165 to PAE/VEGFR-2 cells, although VEGFA165b and VEGF-A121 competed less efficiently than VEGF-A165
and VEGF-A145 (Fig. 1B). VEGF-A165b and VEGF-121 failed to

VEGFR-2 alone (PAE/VEGFR-2), NRP1 alone (PAE/NRP1), or both (PAE/VEGFR-2 and NRP1). Blotting was performed on total cell lysates with antibodies against
VEGFR-2 (top ), NRP1 (middle), and, as a control for equal loading, h-actin (bottom ). B, competition assays on the different PAE cell lines using 125I-VEGF-A165.
Left, 125I-VEGF-A165 binding to PAE/VEGFR-2 cells was competed by unlabeled VEGF-A165, VEGF-A165b, VEGF-A121, or VEGF-A145, indicating binding of
all four VEGF ligands to VEGFR-2. Middle, 125I-VEGF-A165 binding to PAE/NRP1 cells was effectively competed by unlabeled VEGF-A165 and by a 1,000-fold
molar excess of VEGF-A145 but not by VEGF-A165b or VEGF-A121. This suggests efficient binding of VEGF-A165 and very low affinity binding of VEGF-A145 to
NRP1 but no binding of VEGF-A165b or VEGF-A121 to NRP1. Right, 125I-VEGF-A165 binding to PAE/VEGFR-2 and NRP1 cells showed competition by all ligands.
C, the extent of VEGFR-2/NRP1 complex formation was assessed by immunoprecipitation (IP ) of VEGFR-2 followed by immunoblotting (IB ) for NRP1 in PAE/
VEGFR-2 and NRP1 cells treated with 2 nmol/L VEGF-A isoforms for 5 min. Only VEGF-A165 induced detectable VEGFR-2/NRP1 complex formation. Middle, tyrosine
phosphorylation of VEGFR-2; bottom, loading of the receptor. D, [35S]HS retention on nitrocellulose filter as a consequence of specific binding to VEGF-A variants
was examined. [35S]HS was retained by binding to VEGF-A165 and even more efficiently to VEGF-A145. In contrast, [35S]HS did not bind to VEGF-A165b or
VEGF-A121.

compete for binding to cells expressing NRP1 alone. VEGF-A145
showed competition for binding to NRP1, although a 1,000-fold
molar excess of VEGF-A145 was needed, indicating very low
affinity. VEGF-A145 lacks the NRP1-binding exon 7, but exon 8 in
the vegf-a gene has also been implicated in binding to NRP1 (10).
In PAE cells coexpressing VEGFR-2 and NRP1, competition by
VEGF-A165b and VEGF-A121 for binding of 125I-VEGF-A165 was
less efficient than for PAE/VEGFR-2 cells. This agrees with that
VEGF-A165 binds efficiently to NRP1, whereas VEGF-A165b and
VEGF-A121 do not. Again, VEGF-A145 competed, although inefficiently, with the radiolabeled ligand.
Next, the ability of the ligands to induce complex formation
between VEGFR-2 and NRP1 was tested. PAE cells expressing both
VEGFR-2 and NRP1 were treated with the different VEGF-A
isoforms and NRP1/VEGFR-2 complex formation was examined by
immunoprecipitation of VEGFR-2 and immunoblotting to detect
NRP1. As shown in Fig. 1C, all ligands induced VEGFR-2 tyrosine
phosphorylation. Immunoblotting showed that VEGF-A165 induced potent complex formation between VEGFR-2 and NRP1.
In contrast, VEGF-A165b, VEGF-A121, and VEGF-A145 failed to
induce detectable complex formation between NRP1 and VEGFR-2,

in agreement with that the affinity for binding to NRP1 was low for
these factors (see Fig. 1B).
The binding ability of VEGF-A variants to HS was determined
through use of a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (29), in which
metabolically labeled, purified [35S]HS is retained only when bound
to a growth factor. As shown in Fig. 1D, VEGF-165b as well as
VEGF-A121 failed to retain labeled HS, whereas VEGF-A145
retained HS more efficiently than VEGF-A165.
Our data indicate that the binding ability of VEGF-A165b to
coreceptors is similar to that of VEGF-A121 as both fail to bind to
NRP1 as well as to HS. In contrast, VEGF-A165 binds strongly
to both, whereas VEGF-A145 binds strongly to HS and weakly
to NRP1.
VEGFR-2 activation by the VEGF ligands. We next examined
the concentration-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 in the
presence and absence of NRP1 by the different VEGF ligands.
Figure 2A shows that VEGF-A165–induced activation of VEGFR-2
in PAE/VEGFR-2 cells was discernible at 0.1 nmol/L of the ligand.
Tyrosine phosphorylation reached a maximal level at 1 nmol/L of
VEGF-A165, whereafter it decreased slightly. A higher concentration, 0.3 to 1 nmol/L, was required for the other three ligands,

VEGF-A165b, VEGF-A121, and VEGF-A145, to induce VEGFR-2
tyrosine phosphorylation. Maximal receptor tyrosine phosphorylation also required higher concentrations of these ligands and was
achieved at 3 to 10 nmol/L (see quantification of pVEGFR-2/
VEGFR-2 in Fig. 2B). Overall, the concentration-dependent pattern
of VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was similar between all VEGF
isoforms studied, although VEGF-A145 and VEGF-A165b consistently performed less efficiently than VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165.
A similar pattern was seen in PAE/VEGFR-2, NRP1 cells; VEGFA165 and VEGF-A121 induced more potent VEGFR-2 tyrosine
phosphorylation (set in relation to the total VEGFR-2 pool) than
VEGF-A165b and VEGF-A145 (Fig. 2C and D).
We also examined the kinetics of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation.
PAE/VEGFR-2 cells and PAE/VEGFR-2, NRP1 cells were treated
with the VEGF-A ligands for 3 to 240 min. As shown in Fig. 3A
and C (quantification in Fig. 3B and D), the kinetics of receptor
phosphorylation showed the same pattern for all ligands and was
only very moderately affected by expression of NRP1. Thus,
VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced within 5 min
and diminished again after 10 min. The decrease in phosphoryla-

www.aacrjournals.org

tion was due both to dephosphorylation by phosphotyrosine
phosphatases and to internalization and degradation of receptors
(detected as clearance of receptor protein; see immunoblots for
VEGFR-2) followed by restoration of receptor expression by new
synthesis and export of receptors to the cell surface. For a review
on ligand-induced VEGFR activation and internalization, see
ref. 5. For the time course studied, we detected only subtle
differences between the different VEGF isoforms in kinetics of
VEGFR-2 phosphorylation.
In conclusion, VEGF-A165b is able to induce VEGFR-2 tyrosine
phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner with kinetics similar to
that of VEGF-A121 and only slightly less efficiently than VEGF-A165.
Ability of VEGF ligands to induce endothelial cell responses
in vitro. To determine the biological activity in vitro of VEGFA165b, we analyzed the chemoattractive effects of the VEGF
ligands. PAE/VEGFR-2 cells migrated toward VEGF-A165, VEGFA165b, and VEGF-A121 with similar efficiency. In the presence of
NRP1 (i.e., using PAE/VEGFR-2, NRP1 cells), VEGF-A165–induced
endothelial cell migration was enhanced, whereas the migration
induced by VEGF-A165b or VEGF-A121 was not affected by

expression of NRP1. This agrees with the finding that VEGF-A165b
and VEGF-A121 do not bind NRP1. VEGF-A145 showed a unique
pattern in the migration assays using either PAE/VEGFR-2 or
PAE/VEGFR-2, NRP1 cells, as shown in Fig. 4A and B. Strikingly,
VEGF-A145 did not induce the typical bell-shaped curve
with reduced migration at higher concentrations. It is possible
that the very high affinity for binding to HS (see Fig. 1D) influenced
the readout of VEGF-A145 effects in this assay. Thus, we find
that VEGF-A165b is a chemoattractant for cells expressing
VEGFR-2, irrespective of expression of NRP1.
Next, we tested the ability of the VEGF ligands to stimulate
incorporation of [3H]thymidine in TIME cells (Fig. 4C). We
chose TIME cells for this assay because PAE cells are transformed
and therefore not suitable for testing effects on mitogenicity.
VEGF-A165, VEGF-A121, and VEGF-A145 induced significant
effects when given at a concentration of 1 nmol/L. In contrast,
VEGF-A165b did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation.
In conclusion, VEGF-A165b induces VEGFR-2 activation and
short-term endothelial responses such as chemotaxis (5-h duration).
The ability of VEGF-A165b to perform in a more long-term assay,
such as endothelial cell DNA synthesis (24 h), was, however, severely
hampered when compared with other VEGF ligands.

differentiating mouse ES cells, EBs. Hallmarks of vasculogenesis
and angiogenesis are faithfully recapitulated in the EBs subjected
either to two-dimensional cultures or to culture in a threedimensional collagen matrix (26). We previously showed that day
10 EBs (i.e., differentiated for 10 days) express NRP1 and HS, which
colocalize with VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells.4
Two-dimensional EB cultures treated with VEGF-A165 displayed
the typical vascular plexus in the periphery of cultures (Fig. 5A,
top middle; high magnification in the top right). In contrast, VEGFA165b failed to induce formation of vessel structures. Similarly,
treatment with VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A145 did not lead to plexus
formation of endothelial cells in the two-dimensional cultures.
It is noteworthy that although VEGF-A165b and VEGF-A121 lacked
HS-binding ability, this cannot explain their inability to induce
a vascular plexus, as VEGF-A145, which binds strongly to HS
(see Fig. 1D), also failed to induce plexus formation.
The ability of the VEGF-A ligands to induce formation of
angiogenic sprouts was determined in three-dimensional cultures
of EBs. As shown in Fig. 5B (top middle; high magnification in the
top right), VEGF-A165 induced vascular sprouts that invaded into
the collagen matrix. The other VEGF ligands, however, induced
very few short sprouts, if any at all.

lesser extent than in the VEGF-A165–containing Matrigel plugs.
Figure 5D shows quantification of the number of branch points
in the different conditions. We conclude that the in vivo phenotypes of each of the tested VEGF-A isoforms differed and the
degree of response to VEGF-A165 was not matched by any of the
other isoforms. It is noteworthy that VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165b,
which both completely lack NRP1 binding, failed to induce
endothelial cell/pericyte association. Both these ligands also lack
HS-binding ability, which may contribute to the lack of response.
However, VEGF-A145, which binds potently to HS and with low
affinity to NRP1 (see Fig. 1), performed poorly compared with
VEGF-A165.
Differential usage of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in
VEGFR-2 by VEGF-A165b. We asked whether the molecular
mechanisms underlying the inability of certain VEGF ligands to
perform in the angiogenesis assays involved changes in VEGFR-2–
dependent signal transduction. Because signal transduction is
dependent on activation of VEGFR-2 leading to autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, we mapped VEGFR-2 phosphorylation
site usage in response to the different ligands. For this purpose,
we used mouse aortic endothelial (MAE) cells transfected to
enhance mouse VEGFR-2 expression. Immunoblotting showed
functional VEGFR-2 and endogenous NRP1 expression on MAE
cells (Fig. 6A). This cell line was chosen because it showed lower
phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 under basal conditions compared
with other cell lines tested (PAE/VEGFR-2, NRP1 cells and 293
cells) most likely due to less production of endogenous VEGF. Still,
the cells were treated with neutralizing VEGF antibodies overnight
to block the effect of endogenous VEGF production. After washing
and acute treatment of cells with different VEGF-A isoforms,
immunoprecipitated VEGFR-2 was labeled using [g-32P]ATP in
a kinase reaction (Fig. 6A); we have shown that this procedure
faithfully mimics phosphorylation in intact cells (30). The
32
P-labeled VEGFR-2 was isolated and digested with trypsin
followed by two-dimensional separation through electrophoresis
and liquid chromatography.
As shown in Fig. 6B, VEGF-A stimulation induced several
phosphorylated tyrosine spots, indicated as spots a to d in the
figure. We have previously identified the tyrosine sites corresponding to each of these spots by amino acid sequence and by
phosphopeptide mapping using mutated VEGFR-2 with exchange
of tyrosine to phenylalanine residues at individual sites. Thereby,
we have shown that spots a, b, and c correspond to Y949 (Y951 in
the human sequence), Y1052 (Y1054), and Y1212 (Y1214), respectively (see ref. 24). Spot d is a serine/threonine phosphorylation
site whose amino acid sequence position has not been identified.
VEGF-A165 induced all of spots a to c, as did VEGF-A145
(Fig. 6C). All spots were induced by VEGF-A121 as well, although
the level of induction by VEGF-A121 was lower than for VEGFA165. VEGF-A165b induced spots a and c to a similar extent as
VEGF-A121; however, the induction of spot b was essentially lost,
indicating that VEGF-A165b only very poorly, if at all, induces
phosphorylation of Y1052 in mouse VEGFR-2.
In an alternative strategy, we analyzed induction of VEGFR-2
tyrosine phosphorylation of different sites by the VEGF-A isoforms
by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies against
Y1052/Y1057 and Y1212. In addition, we used phosphosite-specific
antibodies to examine phosphorylation of Y1173, another major
tyrosine phosphorylation site that is not amenable to phosphopeptide mapping using the conditions above due to the negative charge of the Y1173-containing tryptic peptide. As shown in

www.aacrjournals.org

Fig. 6D, Y1052/Y1057 was less efficiently phosphorylated by VEGFA165b than by all other ligands, which is compatible with the result
of phosphorylation site mapping. Phosphorylation of Y1173 was
relatively poorly induced by VEGF-A165b, VEGF-A121, and VEGFA145 compared with VEGF-A165. For Y1212, phosphorylation was
more efficiently induced by VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A145 than by
VEGF-A165b. We conclude that Y1052/Y1057 (corresponding to
Y1054/Y1059 in the human sequence) was less efficiently phosphorylated in response to VEGF-A165b treatment than the other
VEGF isoforms.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of
action of VEGF-A165b on VEGFR-2. By comparing its effects with
those of other VEGF-A isoforms, we were able to unequivocally categorize VEGF-A165b as a VEGFR-2 agonist in the absence of expression
of other VEGFRs. We confirm and present a mechanism for the data
by Cebe Suarez and colleagues (18). Thus, like VEGF-A121, VEGFA165b fails to bind to both NRP1 and HS, and both ligands also failed
to induce vascularization in EBs as well as in s.c. Matrigel plugs. We
believe that this deficiency can be explained at least in part by the
lack of engagement of NRP1 in the VEGFR-2 signaling complex.
We also characterized the VEGF-A145 isoform, which lacks exons
6b and 7 in the vegf-a gene. Poltorak and colleagues (31) previously
concluded that VEGF-145 possesses distinct biological properties.
We agree with this conclusion. A marked feature of VEGF-A145
was its very strong binding to HS, 2-fold higher than that for VEGFA165 (cf. Fig. 1D). Furthermore, Poltorak and colleagues showed
that VEGF-A145 binds strongly to extracellular matrix, which may
contribute to the enhanced endothelial cell chemotaxis observed by
us (Fig. 4A and B). Still, VEGF-A145 showed only a weak angiogenic
response in vivo, which we attribute to its poor NRP1-binding
properties. Thus, HS binding alone was insufficient for induction of
potent vascular organization. We conclude that VEGF-A121, VEGFA145, and VEGF-A165b all show low or no binding to NRP1, which
may account for the lack of, or strongly reduced, ability to induce
endothelial cell organization and angiogenesis.
We detected a profound difference in usage of VEGFR-2 tyrosine
phosphorylation sites between VEGF-A165b and the other tested
VEGF-A isoforms. Both by analyzing VEGF-A165b–induced
VEGFR-2–derived tryptic phosphopeptides and by use of phosphosite-specific antibodies, we detected a clear reduction in the
phosphorylation of Y1052/Y1057 (human sequence Y1054/Y1059).
It is noteworthy that Y1052 and Y1057 are located on the activation
loop in the second part of the tyrosine kinase domain. The position
of Y1057 corresponds exactly to that of the positive regulatory
tyrosine residue Y416 in c-Src. Phosphorylation of the activation lip
tyrosine residue(s) locks the loop in an off position, exposing the
ATP-binding site and enhancing kinase activity. The loss of
phosphorylation at Y1052 in VEGFR-2 seemed more profound
when analyzed by phosphopeptide mapping compared with immunoblotting. This may be due to that the different phosphositespecific antibodies bind not only to the phosphotyrosine residue
but also to some extent to the surrounding amino acid residues.
Moreover, the phosphosite-specific antibody detects both Y1052
and Y1057; in the VEGFR-2 phosphopeptide map, we have
identified the position of the Y1052-containing peptide, but we
have not been able to pinpoint the migration position of the Y1057
phosphopeptide (24). The result from the phosphosite-specific
antibody can therefore not be directly compared with the

phosphopeptide mapping results. The phosphopeptide mapping is
less sensitive but allows comparison of the relative stoichiometry
of the different phosphosites.
In vitro , the lower stoichiometry of phosphorylation at
the positive regulatory sites may not be critical because receptors are overexpressed and relatively high concentrations are used
for the purified ligands. Thus, short-term responses may be
relatively unaffected, whereas more long-term responses are
crippled. Reduced phosphorylation at positive regulatory sites
as has been described for VEGFR-1 (28) does not preclude
activation of receptor tyrosine kinases but is associated with poor
responsiveness.
Is the impairment in positive regulation of VEGFR-2 kinase
activity by VEGF-A165b important in its antiangiogenic effect? It is
possible that VEGF-A165b produced in excess would block binding
of VEGF-A165 to VEGFR-2, as these two isoforms bind to VEGFR-2
with the same affinity as judged from Biocore analyses.5 Dependent
on its inability to engage NRP1 in the VEGFR-2 signaling complex
and the loss of efficient phosphorylation at the positive regulatory
sites, VEGF-A165b may therefore occupy VEGFR-2 without
transducing a potent angiogenic effect. Another important
question is why VEGF-A165b does not stimulate phosphorylation
of the positive regulatory sites in VEGFR-2 as do the other VEGF-A
isoforms tested? This may possibly be due to effects of VEGF-A165b
on the rotation of the receptors in the dimer, making the Y1052/

Y1057 less preferred substrates for the VEGFR-2 kinase or
alternatively exposing these phosphosites to rapid dephosphorylation. It is possible that VEGF-A165b would induce differently
rotated VEGFR-2 dimers in a manner directly or indirectly
dependent on its unique COOH-terminal tail. That VEGF-A165b
is folded differently than VEGF-A165 is conceivable as it does not
bind to NRP1 and HS in spite of the fact that exon 7 is included in
the primary sequence of both isoforms. Detailed structural
analyses are required to prove the concept that VEGFR-2 dimers
have different properties when induced by VEGF-A165b compared
with VEGF-A165.
