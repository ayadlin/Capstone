ABSTRACT:
Simalikalactone E (SkE) is a quassinoid extracted from a widely used Amazonian
antimalarial remedy. Although SkE has previously been shown to have cytostatic
and/or cytotoxic activities in some tumor cell lines, its mechanism of action has
not yet been characterized. We show here that SkE in the high nanomolar range
inhibited the growth of various leukemic and solid tumor cell lines. Importantly,
SkE was highly efficient at inhibiting chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells that
exhibit constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway and, accordingly, it impaired the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2. SkE also abrogated MEK1/2 and B-Raf phosphorylation
but had no effect on Ras activity. Moreover, SkE was particularly effective against
melanoma cell lines carrying the B-Raf-V600E mutation. Importantly, SkE resensitized
the PLX-4032-resistant 451Lu melanoma cell line (451Lu-R) and was more efficient
than U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and PLX-4032 (PLX) at inducing the apoptosis of two
Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) patient samples carrying the B-Raf-V600E mutation. Finally,
SkE was as efficient as imatinib at inhibiting tumor formation in a xenograft model of
CML cells in athymic mice. In conclusion, we show that SkE, a very potent inhibitor
of B-Raf-V600E, is highly effective against cancer cell lines that exhibit constitutive
activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.

leading compound for treating malaria. SkE is less toxic
than simalikalactone D (SkD), another antimalarial related
quassinoid from Quassia amara, and its cytotoxicity
towards mammalian cells is dependent on the cell line;
it displays a good selectivity index when tested on nontumorigenic cells. In vivo, SkE inhibits murine malarial
growth of Plasmodium vinckei petteri by 50% at doses
of 1 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day when administered
by the oral and intraperitoneal route, respectively [1].
Furthermore, unpublished data from our laboratories
have established that SkE may have potent antileukemic
activity on several hematological malignancies.
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is frequently
altered in cancer cells, and mutations in this pathway are
recurrent in several hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic
malignancies [2, 3]. It is also worth mentioning that
mutation of an upstream protein in the MAP kinase
pathway excludes the possibility of mutation of another
protein in the pathway [4, 5]. For instance, N-Ras, one
of the upstream regulators of the pathway, is mutated in
20% of melanoma, whereas K-Ras is mutated in 80% of
pancreatic carcinoma. B-Raf, an effector of Ras and the
upstream kinase in the ERK cascade, is frequently mutated
in melanoma (50-70%) [6], Langerhans cell histiocytosis
(57%) [7], thyroid carcinoma (40%) [8] and colorectal
cancer (8%) [9]. The frequency of B-Raf mutation is
generally very low in leukemia; however, it was recently
reported that B-Raf is mutated in most cases of HCL
[10-12]. Finally, mutations in MEK1 are also detected
at a low frequency in melanoma [13]. In all cases, the
mutated protein seems to be endowed with constitutive
activity. Inhibitors of B-Raf such as PLX have been
introduced recently with success as new anti-melanoma
agents that can induce complete remission in patients
[14]. Unfortunately, resistance to PLX has been found to
occur rapidly after the onset of treatment, mainly through
reactivation of the MAP kinase pathway [15]. Therefore, it
is essential to develop new therapeutic strategies aimed at
inhibiting the MAPK pathway in these resistant patients.
Importantly, HCL is another disease characterized
by the B-Raf mutation [10]. HCL is a rare leukemia
affecting B cells. This hematopoietic malignancy is
associated with the B-Raf V600E mutation in most of
patients. This hallmark of the disease has provided the
rationale for the use of vemurafenib (PLX-4032) in two
patients suffering from HCL who had no other therapeutic
options [16]; Peyrade et al. 2012 (in press). In both cases,
a two-month treatment with the drug led to elimination
of the leukemic clone as well as restoration of normal
erythrocyte, platelet and leukocyte counts, which were
accompanied by a considerable improvement in the patient
status.
In the present study, we describe the activity and
mechanism of action of SkE, a new natural compound
extracted from Quassia Amara that exhibits both potent
anti-leukemic and anti-melanoma effects in vitro and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in vivo because of its ability to interfere with the ERK
cascade. Therefore, SkE should be tested as a new
therapeutic option in cancers that exhibit constitutive
activation of the ERK pathway.

RESULTS
SkE exerts potent antileukemic activity in vitro
We have reported previously that SkE is both
cytostatic and cytotoxic for some tumor cell lines [1]. The
present study was conducted to address the mechanism of
action of SkE in different cancer cell lines. We first used
the well-characterized human K562 cell line to determine
whether SkE affects the proliferation of leukemic cells.
To this end, we performed colony formation assays in
soft-agar using increasing doses of SkE or a maximal
dose of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets
BCR-ABL, the fusion oncoprotein responsible for this
disease. As expected, imatinib (1µM) inhibited the
clonogenic potential of K562 cells in soft-agar by more
than 90% (Figure 1A). Importantly, SkE was a highly
potent inhibitor of K562 cell colony formation in identical
conditions, with a maximal effect at 500 nM (Figure 1A).
At this dose, SkE was even more potent than imatinib,
the leading therapy for CML. The IC50 value for the SkE
effect was found to be 250 nM. SkE was also a very potent
inhibitor of CD34+ cell growth for cells isolated from two
CML patients at diagnosis (Figure 1B). Finally, SkE also
exerted potent antileukemic effects on several imatinibresistant CML cell lines (not shown).

SkE inhibits the MAP kinase pathway
In an attempt to identify the potential targets of SkE,
we used the PathScan® RTK signaling antibody array
kit from Cell Signaling, which allows the simultaneous
quantification of the activity of approximately 50 kinases.
Among these kinases, two were significantly affected by
SkE. Indeed, SkE inhibited the activity of ERK by 70%
and c-Abl by 15% (Figure 2 A and B). To confirm the
effect of SkE on BCR-ABL activity, we next incubated
K562 cells for 2 h with 250 nM of SkE and analyzed the
phosphorylation status of both BCR-ABL and known
BCR-ABL substrates. In accordance with the results
obtained with the RTK signaling array kit, we confirmed
the inhibition of c-Abl by SkE as judged by the decreased
phosphorylation of c-Abl as soon as 3 hrs after the
addition of SkE to the culture medium. We also noted a
decrease in the phosphorylation status of STAT5 (Figure
2C). Moreover, dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 was clearly
detected as soon as 30 min after the addition of SkE and
was maximal at 15 h. Collectively, our results confirm that
SkE is a very potent inhibitor of the ERK pathway in K562

cells. Furthermore, it appears that c-Abl dephosphorylation
did not precede ERK dephosphorylation but rather
followed ERK inhibition. Figure 2C also shows that SkE
failed to affect autophagy in K562 CML cells, as assessed
by the absence of delipidation of LC3-b in cells treated
with this drug.

effects of SkE in comparison with U0126, a well-known
inhibitor of MEK1, in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Tamoxifen induced the activation of the ERK pathway,
as assessed by the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2
(Figure 3A). Importantly, SkE (500 nM) was as efficient as
U0126 (2.5 µM) at abolishing tamoxifen-induced ERK1/2
activation (Figure 3B). To precisely identify the target of
SkE, we analyzed the entire ERK pathway. SkE efficiently
inhibited the phosphorylation status of both MEK1/2 and
B-Raf (Figure 3C). However, SkE failed to affect the
activity of Ras in a GST-RAS pull-down assay (Figure
3D). Collectively, our data clearly demonstrate that SkE

of the drug (Figure 3E).

lines and in patients with metastatic melanoma. However,
in patients, the rapid reactivation of the ERK cascade is
responsible for relapses. We investigated whether SkE
was capable of resensitizing PLX-resistant cell lines. To
this end, we used dabrafenib (GSK2118436) sensitive
and resistant melanoma cell lines which also exhibits
cross resistance to vemurafenib (PLX-4720). This PLXsensitive 451 melanoma cell line and its PLX-resistant
counterpart were incubated for 24 h with PLX (1 μM)

or two concentrations of SkE and the cell viability was
assessed using the XTT assay. As expected, the 451LuR melanoma cell lines [22] were fully resistant to PLX,
whereas both the 451Lu-R cell lines were highly sensitive
to the effect of SkE (Figure 4A). Importantly, PLXresistant cells appeared to be even more sensitive to SkE.
We next analyzed the efficiency of U0126, PLX
and SkE on blood cells from two HCL patients carrying

the B-Raf V600E mutation. SkE, at a concentration of
500 nM, induced cell death in more than 70% of the
blood cells, as assessed by propidium iodide staining
(Figure 4B), whereas PLX and U0126 were less efficient,
triggering 55% and 44% cell death, respectively. As a
whole, these findings show that SkE also exhibited high
activity against the B-Raf V600E mutation.

SkE (A) or U0126 (B) for 1 h. Cells were then treated with tamoxifen (1 µM) for one additional hour. Protein samples were separated by

4 times and subjected to SDS/PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). Ras and Phospho-ERK1/2 proteins were detected by Western blot analysis.

SkE inhibits the growth of CML cells in athymic
mice

slides of tumors clearly showed dephosphorylation of
ERK in tumors collected from SkE-treated mice at day
18 (Figure 5C). Clearly, there was also a visible decrease
in the number of K562 cells present in the tumors of SkEtreated animals. Taken collectively, these data demonstrate
that SkE (1 mg/kg) is as effective as imatinib (60 mg/kg),
the leading compound for treating CML patients, which
is used to inhibit CML cell growth in vivo. Moreover, the
effect of SkE in vivo relied on ERK1/2 dephosphorylation.

To address the efficacy of SkE in vivo, we
investigated the ability of the drug to inhibit the growth of
the K562 CML cell line implanted in athymic mice. To this
end, K562 cells carrying the luciferase gene were injected
in the flanks of athymic mice. Mice were randomized and
separated into three groups. When tumors reached 100
mm3 in size (after 5 days), each subgroup of mice was
treated daily with an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle,
60 mg/kg imatinib or 1 mg/kg of SkE. At day 18, imatinib
and SkE had induced tumor regression to a similar extent
(Figure 5A). The tumor size was evaluated by photon
imaging at days 3, 9, 14, 16 and 18 following the injection
of 30 mg/kg of luciferin (Figure 5B). The inhibitory effect
of SkE on K562 cell growth in vivo was detected as early
as 14 days after the onset of injection. By days 16 and
18, there was almost complete regression of tumors in
the imatinib and SkE-treated mice. Finally, histological

DISCUSSION
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is a very attractive
target in cancer therapy. Indeed, numerous solid and
hematopoietic tumors exhibit activation of this pathway
following genetic alterations either in upstream signaling
molecules, such as receptor tyrosine kinases and
oncogenic fusion proteins, or in overexpression of one of
the elements of this pathway [2, 3]. The upstream regulator
of the cascade, Ras, is mutated in 20 to 30% of human
cancers. Of note, the frequency of K-Ras mutations is

very high in advanced pancreatic cancers [23]. Mutations
in the downstream kinase B-Raf are also frequently found
in cancers. This is well exemplified in melanoma, in which
B-Raf mutations are present in 50-70% of patients, and in
HCL, in which the frequency of B-Raf mutations is close
to 100%. In both cases, the B-Raf-V600E mutation is

consistently detected. The downstream kinase MEK1/2 is
mutated at a low frequency in some cancers, and, to date,
there is no evidence of mutation in the downstream kinase
ERK1/2. In addition to mutations in various elements of
the cascade, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is found
to be activated in a very large number of hematopoietic

and solid tumors [2, 24, 25]. For instance, constitutive
activation of the pathway is also observed independent
of activating mutations in solid and hematopoietic
malignancies, including CML, in which the BCR-ABL
fusion oncoprotein (which drives the pathology) is
responsible for ERK1/2 activation. Importantly, our group
and others have also reported a high constitutive activation
of ERK1/2 in several tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant
CML cell lines [26-28]. Of note, SkE was also found to be
highly effective at killing these tyrosine kinase inhibitorresistant CML cell lines (data not shown).
The present study was conducted to determine
whether SkE could be used as an antitumoral agent. We
show here that very low doses of SkE efficiently inhibited
the growth of several solid and hematopoietic cancer cell
lines, including melanoma and CML cell lines. Of note,
SkE was highly efficient in cells exhibiting constitutive
activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. For
instance, SkE was found to be ten-fold more effective in
melanoma cell lines carrying the V600E B-Raf mutation
than in melanoma cell lines that did not carry a mutation
(Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, SkE was also very
potent in CML cell lines exhibiting constitutive activation
of the MAP kinase pathway following the expression of
the BCR ABL fusion protein.
To decipher the mechanism of action of SkE, we
used both melanoma and CML cell lines and primary
cells from patients diagnosed with melanoma and HCL
and demonstrated that low concentrations of SkE interfere
with the activation of ERK, as shown by the clear
inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We next sought
to identify the specific point in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway affected by SkE in different cellular models with
either constitutive or inducible MAPK kinase activation.
Importantly, SkE impaired the activities of both MEK
and B-Raf. By contrast, SkE failed to affect Ras activity,
strongly suggesting that the drug acts at the level of
B-Raf to inhibit the ERK pathway. At present, it is not
known whether SkE also affects the activity of other Raf
isoforms, including A-Raf and C-Raf.
Importantly, chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug with
a chemical structure different from SkE, has previously
been reported to inhibit ERK activation [29]. However, the
chloroquine dose necessary to achieve complete inhibition
of ERK in human peripheral blood monocytes in this study
was 1000 times higher than the one used in the present
study for SkE in melanoma and CML cell lines. This very
high potency of SkE in inhibiting B-Raf prompted us to
assess its activity in melanoma cell lines carrying B-RafV600E mutations and in primary cells from HCL patients
who consistently carried this mutation. SkE potently
inhibited the growth and clonogenic potential of both cell
lines, confirming the very potent anti-tumoral effect of this
drug, particularly in cells exhibiting constitutive activation
of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade.
Owing to its ability to inhibit lysosomal protease,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chloroquine is often used as an inhibitor of autophagy, a
catabolic process that can favor cell survival in adverse
conditions, such as cellular stress and nutrient deprivation
[30]. In this line, the inhibition of autophagy can sensitize
cancer cell lines to chemotherapy, and several clinical
trials have been initiated that include chloroquine as a
second-line therapeutic agent in different forms of cancers
[31, 32]. However, the findings presented herein clearly
establish that an optimal concentration of SkE failed to
affect the lipidation of LC3, arguing against an effect of
SkE on autophagy induction when used as a single drug.
In the present study, we also demonstrated that SkE
drastically reduced the growth of CML cells in athymic
mice. A dose as low as 1 mg/kg of SkE was sufficient to
inhibit the growth of K562 cells, whereas 60 mg/kg of
imatinib mesylate, the leading treatment for CML, was
required to obtain a similar effect. These results clearly
show that SkE has an excellent in vivo bioavailability
in mice. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that the
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of SkE are
intimately linked to its ability to interfere with the MAP
kinase cascade. This was confirmed by our analysis of
tumor histological slides from athymic mice grafted with
K562 CML cell lines, which clearly showed a complete
inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in SkE-treated
mice.
Finally, we also present evidence that SkE is highly
effective at circumventing dabrafenib (GSK2118436)
resistance in melanoma cell lines. Dabrafenib is a potent
B-Raf inhibitor currently used in phase III studies for
metastatic melanoma. It has been reported that dabrafenib
initially induced complete remission in patients with
metastatic melanoma [14]. However, following this initial
beneficial response, all of the patients relapsed. Relapses
are likely due to the reactivation of the MAPK pathway
and, accordingly, MEK inhibitors such as U0126 can
efficiently resensitize dabrafenib-resistant cell lines in
vitro. Our group and others have recently reported that the
B-Raf inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4720) is very effective
in HCL patients who carry the B-Raf V600E mutation,
inducing complete remission and the restoration of normal
blood cell counts and hemoglobin concentration in patients
with refractory HCL [11]. Another important finding of
the present study is that low concentrations of SkE can
inhibit the growth of primary cells from HCL patients
more efficiently than vemurafenib (i.e., inhibition occurs
in the high nanomolar range versus the micromolar range).
In conclusion, we describe here for the first time the
unusual ability of the new compound SkE to inhibit B-Raf
activation not only in melanoma and HCL but also in CML
cell lines exhibiting constitutive activation of the ERK
pathway. In addition, we show that this drug is highly
effective at inhibiting HCL-patient-derived primary blood
cells carrying this mutation and at inhibiting melanoma
cell line with acquired resistance to the B-Raf inhibitors
PLX-4720 and GSK2118436. Finally, we also show
1695

evidence that SkE at very low doses is highly effective
in a preclinical murine model of CML. Collectively, our
findings show that SkE  could be a new weapon in the
armamentarium of drugs targeting cancers that exhibit
constitutive activation of the ERK pathway and that SkE
warrants testing in humans.

was estimated to be at least 90% by FACS analysis.
Experiments were performed using an IMDM (10% fetal
bovine serum) for CML and HCL cells.

Cell lines
The human CML K562 cell line was provided by
ATCC and was grown at 37°C under 10% CO2 in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS (Gibco BRL,
Paisley, UK) and 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 µg/ml
streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. 293 RAF/ER
cells are a derivative of HEK-293 (ATCC: CRL1573)
cells that stably express a fusion protein comprising
the catalytic domain of Raf-1 and the hormone-binding
domain of the estrogen receptor. 293 RAF/ER cells were
cultured in DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with
10% heat inactivated FCS, as described previously [17].
The 451Lu melanoma cells, which are sensitive or resistant
to PLX-4720, were grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS.

Colony formation assay

Measurement of cell metabolism (XTT)

SkE was added to the K562 CML cell lines
(103 cells/ml) growing in semi-solid methylcellulose
medium. MethoCult H4100 was used for cell lines
(StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada).
Colonies were detected after 10 days of culture by

using GST-c-Raf RBD to pull down active GTP-bound
Ras from cell extracts by glutathione beads. The beads
were washed 4 times and subjected to SDS/PAGE (12%
polyacrylamide). Ras and Phospho-ERK1/2 proteins were
detected by Western blot analysis as described previously
[21].

Microscopic analysis of tumors

Statistical analysis

Tumors from control or SkE-treated mice
were removed, frozen and cut in preparation for
immunostaining. Slides containing a representative section
of each tumor were fixed, permeabilized and incubated
with anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 or anti-ERK antibodies
diluted in PBS and 1% BSA at RT for 1 h. Then, cells
were washed and incubated with a secondary anti-Rabbit
antibody. Finally, DAPI was used to label the nuclei,
and the slides were mounted and then analyzed under a
fluorescence microscope (LEICA TCR5500, Leica, Somls,
Germany).

All data are presented as the mean ± SD of at
least three independent determinations. P-values were
determined using the Prism V5.0b software (GraphPad,
La Jolla, CA, USA). Unless stated otherwise in the figure
legend, comparisons of the different groups were made
with the one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction.
P-values of 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**) and 0.001 (***) were
considered statistically significant.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Tumor regression experiments in athymic Mice

We are indebted to Drs. M. Herlyn and J. Villanueva
(Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for the kind
gift of the 451Lu melanoma cells that are sensitive
and resistant to GSK2118436 and PLX-4720. We also
acknowledge Dr. Gilles Pages for the kind gift of the
293 RAF/ER cells. We acknowledge the C3M Imaging
Core Facility (MICA) and genomic facility. We thank
the Conseil Regional PACA and the Conseil Général des
Alpes-Maritimes for their financial support to C3M. We
also acknowledge the Département de la valorisation de
l’IRD for financial and legal advice and support.

Female athymic NMRI Mice (Janvier, Le Genest
Saint Ile, France) were randomized into 3 experimental
groups, each containing 7 animals. Two sets of animals
received a 200 µl injection of 5.106 K562-Luc leukemia
cells in both flanks. When tumors reached 100 mm3,
the animals were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle
(PBS), Imatinib or SkE at dose levels of 60 mg/kg and
1 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The growth of the
leukemic cells comprising the tumor was visualized
in the animal at different days after intraperitoneal
injection of 30 mg/kg luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) by
bioluminescence imaging with a Photon Imager (Biospace
Lab), as described elsewhere [20]. The in vivo study was
conducted according to French legislation on laboratory
animal use and care (N°2001-464).

GRANT SUPPORT
This work was supported by grant from the Ligue
Nationale Contre le Cancer “Equipe labellisée 20112013”. GR and AJ are recipients of fellowships from the
Fondation de France and the Ligue Nationale Contre le
Cancer respectively.

Measurement of cell death
Following U0126, PLX-4720 or SkE treatment,
HCL cells were stained with propidium iodide, and the
stained cells were analyzed with a cytometer.
