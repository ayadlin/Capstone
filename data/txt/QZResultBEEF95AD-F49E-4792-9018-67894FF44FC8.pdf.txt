ABSTRACT
p21CDKN1A is known as a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), which
regulates cell cycle in response to various stimuli, including DNA damage, on the p53dependent manner. Here we demonstrate that protein arginine methyltransferase
6 (PRMT6) methylates p21 at arginine 156 and promotes phosphorylation of
threonine 145 on p21, resulting in the increase of cytoplasmic localization of p21. The
cytoplasmic presence of p21 makes cancer cells more resistant to cytotoxic agents.
Our results indicate that PRMT6 appears to be one of the key proteins to dysregulate
p21 functions in human cancer, and targeting this pathway may be an appropriate
strategy for development of anticancer drugs.

results imply that p21 protein may have distinct biological
functions depending on its localization in the cell.
Both amount and activity of p21 protein are
controlled by post-translational modifications. Three E3
ubiquitin ligase complexes, SCFSKP2 (SKP1-CUL1-SKP2),
CRL4CDT2 (CUL4A or CUL4B-DDB1-CDT2) and APC/
CCDC20 poly-ubiquitinate p21, and promote the proteasomedependent proteolysis at specific cell cycle stages [2].
Tip 60-mediated acetylation is shown to counteract
ubiquitination and stabilizes p21 protein [10]. In addition,
multiple kinases have been reported to phosphorylate
p21 and regulate its stability, protein-protein interactions
and subcellular localization [11]. For example, Cyclin
E/CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of p21 at serine
130 provides a docking site for SCFSKP2 E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex, leading to proteasomal degradation
[12]. Moreover, phosphorylation of p21 at serine 145
was reported to promote cytoplasmic localization of
p21 [11, 13]. However, methylation of p21 has not been
reported so far.
In the present study, we demonstrate that the protein
arginine methyltransferase PRMT6, which is involved in

INTRODUCTION
The cell cycle progression is strictly regulated
through orchestrated functions by CDKs and CDK
inhibitors [1, 2]. Cells possess several cell-cycle
checkpoints to induce cell cycle arrest or to induce
apoptosis when the genomic integrity is threatened,
preventing the transmission of dangerous genetic
mutations into subsequent cell generations [3]. p21CDKN1A
(WAF1/CIP1) was identified as a potent inhibitor of CDK
[4], and is a key molecule to mediate p53-dependent G1
arrest [5]. In addition, by binding to Proliferating Cell
Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), p21 interferes with PCNAdependent DNA polymerase activity, thereby inhibiting
DNA replication and also modulating various PCNAdependent DNA repair processes [2, 6]. Accumulated
evidence reveals that nuclear localization of p21 is
necessary for these tumor suppressive functions [7].
Meanwhile, cytoplasmic p21 protein has been indicated
to show an anti-apoptotic effect [7]. Cytoplasmic p21
protein is able to bind to and inhibit caspase 3, as well
as the apoptotic kinases ASK1 and JNK [7–9]. These

addition, we show evidence that translocation of p21

immunoprecipitation and subjected to western blot
analysis using the methylation-specific antibody. As
shown in Figure 2E, the signal intensity was significantly
increased by co-transfection with PRMT6, indicating that
p21 is methylated by PRMT6 in vivo. Subsequently, we
introduced wild-type p21 or R156A-mutant p21 with
PRMT6 in 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation
and western blot analysis using the methylation-specific
antibody. Then we confirmed that the methylation signal
was abolished in R156A-mutant p21 (Figure 2F). To
further validate PRMT6-mediated p21 methylation in vivo,
we introduced both p21 and PRMT6 together in 293T
cells, and purified the protein by immunoprecipitation
(Figure 3A). The band corresponding to the FLAG-p21
was digested in gel with trypsin, and then the digestion
mixture was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The
mass spectra with retention time 19.04, 19.09 and 19.11
indicate both monomethylation and dimethylation of
R156 on p21 in vivo (Figure 3A and 3B). The selected ion
current chromatograms of non-, mono- and dimethylated
p21 peptides showed that the dimethylation seems to be
a major methylation form of R156 on p21 (Figure 3C).
This is consistent with the previous studies which showed
that PRMT6 catalyzes asymmetric dimethylation, and
also produces monomethylation on an arginine residue
[14]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that p21 is
methylated at arginine 156 by PRMT6 in vivo.

RESULTS
In vitro methylation of p21 by PRMT6
In order to elucidate whether p21 serves as a
substrate of protein methyltransferase reaction, we
conducted in vitro methyltransferase assays using a
variety of lysine and arginine methyltransferases that are
shown to be involved in human tumorigenesis, and found
that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 methylates
p21 (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1). Next,
we examined liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify an
arginine residue(s) to be methylated by PRMT6 and found
that arginine 156 on p21 was dimethylated by PRMT6
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2). To further
verify the methylation, we prepared recombinant wild-type
(WT) and arginine 156-substituted p21 (R156A) proteins,
and performed an in vitro methyltransferase assay. The
methylation signal was significantly diminished in p21R156A protein compared to p21-WT protein (Figure 1C),
indicating that p21 is methylated by PRMT6 at arginine
156 in vitro. This arginine residue is conserved among
various species, implying the functional importance of this
amino acid (Figure 1D).

Effect of PRMT6-mediated methylation on
subcellular localization of p21
Since arginine methylation was suggested to
regulate the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins
[16], we co-introduced p21 and PRMT6 in HeLa
cells, and examined subcellular localization of p21.
Immunocytochemical analysis showed that p21 was
mainly localized in the nucleus of the cells in which
PRMT6 expression was absent or low, whereas
cytoplasmic p21 was significantly increased in the cells
in which PRMT6 was highly expressed (Figure 4A). On
the contrary, R156A-mutant p21 was localized in the
nucleus regardless to the PRMT6 expression (Figure 4B).
In order to validate this result, we fractionated HCT116
cells overexpressing wild-type p21 or R156A-mutant
p21, and quantified the amount of p21 protein in each
fraction. We confirmed that the proportion of nuclear
p21 was significantly high in R156A-ovrexpressing cells
(Figure 4C), suggesting that the methylation at arginine
156 appears to enhance cytoplasmic localization of p21.
To assess the effect of the methylation on p21 localization
in the endogenous level, we examined the localization
of p21 after PRMT6 knockdown. The proportion of
the nuclear p21 protein was significantly elevated by
siPRMT6 treatment, and interestingly, the total amount
of p21 protein was remarkably increased (Figure 4D).
Since p21 mRNA levels were significantly increased

In vivo p21 methylation
We subsequently performed co-immunoprecipitation
assays and confirmed the interaction between p21 and
PRMT6 in both endogenous and exogenous levels
(Figure 2A, 2B and Supplementary Figure S3). We also
conducted co-immunoprecipitation analysis using a partial
PRMT6 protein (aa 1–209) and found that p21 bound to
the N-terminal half fragment of PRMT6 including the
methyltransferase domain (Figure 2C). Then, to verify
the methylation of p21 in vivo, we generated a polyclonal
antibody that specifically recognizes dimethylated
arginine 156 on p21 (p21 R156me2). Specificity of the
antibody was confirmed by in vitro methyltransferase
assay using recombinant p21 protein followed by
western blot (Figure 2D). The methylation specific
signal was observed when p21 protein was incubated
with PRMT6, but not when it was incubated with BSA
(Figure 2D), indicating that the antibody specifically
recognizes methylated p21. Using this methylationspecific antibody, we examined methylation status of p21
in vivo. Firstly, we co-transfected FLAG-p21 together
with HA-mock vector or with HA-PRMT6 expression
vector into 293T cells. p21 proteins were purified by

after knockdown of PRMT6 (Supplementary Figure S4),
it appears that PRMT6 represses p21 expression at the
transcriptional level as concordant with a previous report
[17]. These data indicate that PRMT6-mediated R156
methylation is likely to enhance cytoplasmic localization
of p21.

by R156A substitution (Figure 5A). To further validate
the importance and interaction of the R156 methylation
and T145 phosphorylation, we additionally prepared
two mutant clones that contain T145A or T145A/R156A
substitution, and examined subcellular localization.
Consequently, we confirmed that the difference of nuclear/
cytoplasmic portion between wild-type p21 and R156A
mutant p21 became significantly small if threonine 145
was mutated (Figure 4C and 5B). These results imply that
R156 methylation enhances phosphorylation of threonine
145 on p21, which appears to the mechanism to promote
cytoplasmic localization of p21 in cancer cells.

Molecular mechanism of p21 translocation
promoted by PRMT6-mediated methylation
It was reported that phosphorylation of p21 at
threonine 145, which is located within the nuclear
localization signal, regulates the p21 subcellular
localization [11, 13]. Hence we hypothesized that
the methylation at arginine 156 might affect the
phosphorylation at threonine 145 and thereby influence
the localization of p21. We then examined the
phosphorylation levels of wild-type and R156A-mutant
p21, and found that the phosphorylation was attenuated

[18, 19], in the presence or absence of PRMT6
overexpression (Figure 5C, left). The proportion of cells
at S phase increased while the cells at G0/G1 and sub-G1
phases were decreased by PRMT6 overexpression. Taken
together with previous studies showing that nuclear
p21 has a critical role to induce the G1 arrest and that
cytoplasmic p21 causes chemoresistance of cancer cells by
inhibiting proteins essential for apoptosis [20], this result
indicates that the methylation-mediated p21 translocation
appears to affect the regulation of cell cycle progression
and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Furthermore,
the effect on cell cycle regulation induced by PRMT6
overexpression was not observed in p53 null cell lines
(Figure 5C, right). Given p21 expression following DNA
damage is induced by p53 [19], this result supports that
the cell cycle regulation by PRMT6 overexpression is
mediated by p21. We also evaluated the effect of PRMT6

overexpression on chemosensitivity and found that the
IC50 of doxorubicin in PRMT6-overexpressing cells were
significantly higher than that in control cells (Figure 5D).
Taken together, p21 translocation promoted by PRMT6mediated methylation appears to reduce chemosensitivity,
which may cause chemoresistance of cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that PRMT6
methylates p21 at arginine 156 both in vitro and in vivo,
and increases cytoplasmic localization of p21. Previous
studies indicated that phosphorylation of threonine
145, which is located in the nuclear export signal
motif, inhibits nuclear translocation of p21 [11, 13].
Our data imply that the PRMT6-mediated methylation
then increase cytoplasmic localization of p21 through

enhancement of the phosphorylation. Recently, Zhou et al.
reported that cytoplasmic p21 induced by p65 prevents
doxorubicin-mediated cell death in cancer cells [21], and
accumulated knowledge clearly indicates that cytoplasmic
p21 induces chemoresistant characteristics of cancer cells
[22, 23]. Given that nuclear localization is required for
cell-cycle arrest of cancer cells by p21, PRMT6-mediated
R156 methylation may impair growth suppressive
functions of p21 due to the promotion of its cytoplasmic
subcellular localization in cancer cells.
PRMT6 has been considered as a histone
arginine methyltransferase [24, 25] and reported to be
predominantly localized in the nucleus [26, 27]. However,
our results showed that PRMT6 is mainly localized in
the cytoplasm in both exogenous and endogenous levels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 4A, 4B and 4D), suggesting that the localization
of PRMT6 may be altered based on the cell type and/or
extrinsic stimuli. Even though whether PRMT6 methylates
p21 in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm is still unknown, the
present results imply that PRMT6 may play an important
role in the functional regulation of not only histone
proteins but also non-histone proteins as other histone
methyltransferases [28–34].
Importantly, PRMT6 also suppresses p21 expression
at the transcriptional level (Supplementary Figure S4)
[17, 35]. Taken together with our findings, we suggest
that PRMT6 may robustly inhibit the growth suppressive
functions of p21 by two independent mechanisms; one is
the transcriptional repression and the other is the increase
of cytoplasmic localization of p21 through enhancement

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of the phosphorylation at T145, which is known to inhibit
the translocation of p21 from cytoplasm to nucleus [2].
These results demonstrate that PRMT6 is a key protein
to induce p21 dysfunctions in human cancer. Given
that the induction of p21-mediated growth suppressive
functions is considered as a critical mechanism for several
anticancer agents such as HDAC inhibitors [36, 37] and
that PRMT6 is significantly overexpressed in various
types of cancer [15], PRMT6 is likely to be a promising
anti-cancer drug target. Indeed, dysregulation of arginine
and lysine methyltransferases have frequently been
observed in human cancer [38–43], and these enzymes are
now considered as emergent targets for anti-cancer drug
development [14, 39, 44]. DNA-damaging chemotherapy
in combination with a PRMT6 inhibitor is expected to
improve the clinical outcome of anti-cancer treatment.

Chemosensitivity assay
HCT116 p53+/+ cells were transfected with a mock
vector or a FLAG-PRMT6 expression vector using Fugene
HD reagent (Promega). Cells were treated with various
concentrations of doxorubicin 24 h after transfection
and cultured for 96 h. Cell viability was measured
using CCK-8 (Dojindo). IC50 was calculated using the
SigmaPlot software.
