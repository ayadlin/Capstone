BACKGROUND: The development of antigen-targeted therapies may provide additional options to improve outcomes
in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The Children’s Oncology Group AAML03P1 trial sought to determine
the safety of adding 2 doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanized anti-CD33 antibody-targeted agent, to intensive chemotherapy during remission induction and postremission intensification for children with de novo AML.
METHODS: AAML03P1 enrolled 350 children with previously untreated AML. Patients with a matched family donor
received 3 courses of chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; those without a matched
family donor received 5 courses of chemotherapy. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3 mg/m2/dose was administered on Day
6 of Course 1 and Day 7 of Course 4. RESULTS: Toxicities observed in all courses of therapy were typical of AML
chemotherapy regimens, with infection being most common. Patients achieved a complete remission rate of 83% after 1 course and 87% after 2 courses. The mortality rate was 1.5% after the first gemtuzumab ozogamicin-containing
induction course and 2.6% after 2 induction courses. The 3-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 53
 6% and 66  5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This trial determined that it is safe and feasible to include gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with intensive chemotherapy. The survival rates compare favorably with the recently

KEYWORDS: AAML03P1, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, newly diagnosed, childhood acute myeloid leukemia, children.

The prognosis for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved over the past 3 decades.1-10 Complete
remission (CR) rates as high as 93% and overall survival (OS) rates of up to 65% are now reported worldwide. Dose intensification, improved supportive care, and effective salvage regimens have transformed a disease that was once uniformly
fatal into one that is potentially curable for most patients. Despite these advances, the cure rate for children with AML lags
behind that for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia due foremost to relapse.
Specific treatment strategies for children with AML have focused on intensifying induction and postremission therapy. Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) study 2891 successfully tested intensively timed induction chemotherapy consisting of dexamethasone, cytarabine (ara-C), thioguanine, etoposide, and rubidomycin (daunomycin).11 The successor trial,
CCG-2961, incorporated idarubicin into this induction regimen, achieving 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS rates

of 48  5% and 63  5%, respectively, after much more
aggressive supportive care measures were instituted.12 The
Medical Research Council (MRC) clinical trials have
attempted to intensify the dosing, duration, and total
number of courses of treatment for patients with AML.
By using an extended induction regimen and postinduction intensification therapy based on high-dose ara-C and
anthracyclines, the MRC 10 and 12 clinical trials achieved
excellent 5-year EFS and OS rates (MRC 10: 48% and
57%; MRC 12: 55% and 67%).5
As our understanding of the biology of AML
improves, the development of antigen-targeted therapies
provides us with additional options to improve outcomes.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a recombinant humanized
anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody linked to calicheamicin,
a potent antitumor antibiotic.13 Phase 1 and 2 studies
have shown the safety and efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin both as a single agent and in combination with
chemotherapy in adults and children.14-19 There was concern about liver toxicity in adult trials using higher doses
(6 and 9 mg/m2) in combination with cytotoxic agents.20
Pediatric and younger adult clinical trials have successfully
addressed these concerns by reducing the dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, eliminating repeated or consecutive
course doses, and avoiding administration in tandem with
thioguanine.16,19,21 In July of 2010, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market
based in part on the results of Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) study 106. This study demonstrated no benefit
when gemtuzumab ozogamicin was added to induction or
postconsolidation therapy, and reported an increase in
induction deaths compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone (5.4 % vs 1.4 %, respectively). However,
these results may be confounded because of a lower dose
of daunorubicin in those patients receiving gemtuzumab
ozogamicin as well as an induction death rate lower than
that usually seen in chemotherapy trials for patients of
that age.22 In fact, MRC 15 recently reported no significant increase in toxicity in those randomized to a gemtuzumab ozogamicin-containing arm. Importantly, this
study showed a significant survival benefit for patients
with favorable cytogenetics who received gemtuzumab
ozogamicin during induction. This effect mimicked that
seen in the SWOG 106 study.23 Definitive randomized
trials evaluating the effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin
continue in the Children’s Oncology Group and the Berlin, Frankfurt, Munster Cooperative Group.
Here we describe the findings of the Children’s Oncology Group pilot study AAML03P1. On the basis of

762

the excellent EFS and OS and the low treatment-related
mortality (TRM) rates (9%) observed in MRC 12, the
Children’s Oncology Group opted to test the feasibility of
a modified MRC regimen in combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The primary aim of this study was to
determine the safety and CR rate of the well-established,
2-course intensive induction regimen with the addition of
a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In addition, the
study evaluated the safety of adding a subsequent dose of
gemtuzumab ozogamicin to the mitoxantrone and cytarabine intensification course administered to children not
undergoing a matched family donor hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT). Initially, the study was
designed to accrue 150 patients. A subsequent amendment expanded AAML03P1 enrollment to accrue 15
additional patients with primary induction failure in
whom a suitable unrelated donor could be identified. As a
result, AAML03P1 enrolled 350 patients, making it the
largest pediatric de novo AML clinical trial since the closure of CCG-2961, and among the first to implement
MRC-based therapy in the United States.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
AAML03P1 opened to accrual in December 2003 and
completed accrual in November 2005. Data analyses are
current as of August 21, 2009. Eligible patients were 1
month and 21 years old with primary, untreated AML
who met diagnostic criteria as set out by the FrenchAmerican-British (FAB) classification system. Patients
with acute promyelocytic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, documented bone marrow (BM) failure
syndromes, Down syndrome, or secondary/treatmentrelated leukemia were not eligible. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were not eligible unless they presented with karyotypic abnormalities characteristic of de
novo AML. In May of 2005, an amendment expanded
AAML03P1 enrollment to accrue 15 additional patients
with primary induction failure in whom a suitable unrelated donor could be identified (or 180 additional patients
from whom these additional 15 could be identified). This
was necessary to achieve a secondary objective of the
study, which sought to determine the feasibility of finding
a suitable unrelated stem cell donor within 21 days of
study entry. Institutional review boards at participating
centers approved the study, and participating patients or
their parents signed written informed consent. The original clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT00070174.

Risk classifications were not assigned prospectively,
as the primary aim was limited to safety across all risk
groups. Morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses
were performed according to study guidelines. FAB data
were limited to institutional review only. The cytogenetic
data presented here are a combination of institutional and
central review. Because this was a retrospective subanalysis, response to induction therapy was not included in this
risk assignment. Low-risk patients were defined for analysis purposes as those having inv(16)/t(16;16) or t(8;21),
and high-risk patients were defined as those having
monosomy 7 or del(5q). Patients with an accepted cytogenetic sample who did not meet criteria for low or high risk
were defined as intermediate risk. Patients without cytogenetic data were not included in the retrospective
subanalysis.
Treatment Plan
Figure 1 shows the schema of the study, and the legend
describes the details of drug dose and administration.
Treatment consisted of a remission induction phase
(Induction I and Induction II) followed by an intensification phase (Intensification I, II, and III). Patients with
<20% blasts after Induction I as determined by BM examination went on to receive a second course of Ara-C,
daunorubicin, and etoposide, and those with 20% blasts
were removed from the study. Patients with 5% blasts
after Induction II were removed from the study, and those
with <5% blasts received systemic intensification therapy
based on the MRC trials. Intensification I consisted of
high-dose ara-C and etoposide and was based on the
MRC amsacrine, cytarabine, and etoposide (MACE) regimen. Amsacrine, an intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, was not available in the United States and was
replaced by a higher dose of cytarabine than was given in
the MRC trials, 10 g/m2/course versus 1 g/m2/course.
The etoposide dose was increased from 500 mg given in
the MRC trials to 750 mg. After Intensification I, patients
with a 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 matched family donor were assigned
to receive allogeneic HSCT. Patients without matched
family donors received 2 additional intensification cycles
(total of 3). Intensification II consisted of mitoxantrone
and cytarabine with a slightly different administration
schedule than that given in the MRC trials but identical
to that used and piloted in prior CCG trials.24 Central
nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal cytarabine on Day 1 of Induction I and II, as well as
Day 1 of Intensification I and II. For patients with overt
CNS disease at diagnosis (any number of blasts in an

Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and Escherichia coli L-asparaginase 6000 U/m2
(200 U/kg) intramuscularly on Days 2 and 9. Central nervous
system prophylaxis was intrathecal cytarabine on Day 1 of

given twice weekly until the cerebrospinal fluid was clear
of blasts, followed by 2 additional intrathecal treatments.
It was suggested, but not required, that patients have
an absolute neutrophil count >1000/lL and a platelet
count >106/lL before beginning each course. CR was
defined as <5% blasts with trilineage maturation and no
evidence of extramedullary disease. Partial remission (PR)
was defined as the presence of 5% to 20% blasts after 1
course of induction therapy seen on 2 separate BM examinations by morphology or the persistence of extramedullary disease. Supportive care guidelines were consistent
with those implemented in postamendment CCG2961.12

Statistical Plan and Analysis
The primary outcome measures were remission status after Induction I and II, OS, EFS, disease-free survival
(DFS), relapse risk, and TRM. The significance of
observed differences in proportions was tested using the
chi-square test and Fisher exact test when data were sparse.
The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the significance of differences between medians. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate OS, EFS, and DFS. OS was
defined as the time from study entry (or from the end of
Induction I or II for CR patients) to death. EFS was
defined as time from study entry until death, Induction I
failure (ie, refractory disease with BM blasts >20%, CNS
relapse, persistent CNS disease, or a second malignancy),
Induction II failure (ie, fail to achieve CR), or relapse.
DFS was defined as either the time from the end of Induction I until death, Induction II failure, or relapse or the
time from the end of Induction II until death or relapse
for patients who achieved CR. Estimates of relapse risk
and TRM were obtained using the method of cumulative
incidence that accounts for competing events. Relapse risk
was calculated as the risk of relapse from the end of Induction I to relapse, progressive disease (PD) death, or Induction II failure, and non-PD deaths were considered
competing events. TRM was calculated as the risk of mortality from study entry or from the end of Induction I to
non-PD death, where relapses, PD deaths, and induction
failures were considered competing events. Relapse risk
and TRM were also assessed similarly for patients in CR
at the end of Induction II. The significance of predictor
variables was tested with Gray’s statistic for relapse risk
and TRM. Cox proportional hazards models were used
for univariate and multivariate analyses comparing study
entry characteristics. Patients lost to follow-up were censored at their date of last known contact or at a cutoff 6
months before the date of analyses: August 21, 2009 for
AAML03P1 and October 30, 2006 for CCG-2961. For
AAML03P1 subjects in CR after Intensification I, outcomes were compared for those with and without an
matched family donor.

RESULTS
Of 350 patients enrolled in the study, 340 were eligible.
Ten patients were identified as ineligible because of starting treatment before enrollment (3 patients), starting
treatment before consent was obtained (1 patient), having
AML with an FAB classification of M3 by anatomic pathology report (2 patients), having acute promyelocytic

764

leukemia by cytogenetic report (2 patients), omission of
cardiac function evaluation before treatment (1 patient),
or not meeting the study definition for AML at study
entry (1 patient). Table 1 lists the characteristics of the
340 eligible patients enrolled in AAML03P1. The FAB
and cytogenetic data are presented in Table 1. Cytogenetic data were not available for 7% of eligible patients.
The length in days of each cycle for patients completing all therapy and time to neutrophil and platelet
count recovery are summarized in Table 2. Intensification
II was the longest cycle of therapy (median, 49 days), only
slightly longer than Intensification III (median, 48 days).
This was because of prolonged absolute neutrophil count
recovery (median, 52 days) and platelet recovery (median,
46 days).
Table 3 shows the response of patients to Induction
I and Induction II therapy. Of the treatment failures,
5.6% had >20% blasts after 1 induction cycle, and 3.2%
had >5% blasts after 2 induction cycles. The death rate
during Induction I was 1.5%. The causes of death during
Induction I included hemorrhage (n ¼ 2), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n ¼ 1), postoperative abdominal
bleeding (n ¼ 1), and multiorgan failure (n ¼ 1). For
Induction I and II together, the overall death rate was
2.6%, with 3 deaths attributed to infection during Induction II. Overall, 34 patients were not evaluable by the end
of 2 cycles. This included 9 patients who withdrew after
Induction I with a CR (n ¼ 4) or PR (n ¼ 5), 9 patients
who withdrew from study without a BM evaluation performed after Induction I, and 16 patients without a BM
evaluation performed after Induction II. The subsequent
TRM rate in later courses of therapy from the end of
Induction I for patients in CR was 9  3%, and the TRM
rate from the end of Induction II for patients in CR was 7
 3%.
The most common non–HSCT-related, nonhematologic adverse events (grade 3) are summarized in Table 4. Infection data were collected in a manner that may
have included minor and nonsterile site infections along
with bloodstream infections. As expected, documented
infections were the most common toxicity during each
treatment course. Transaminitis grade 3 did occur in a
higher percentage of patients during Induction I (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 9%; alanine aminotransferase [ALT], 11%) than in Induction II (AST, 3%; ALT,
4%), which could possibly reflect a gemtuzumab ozogamicin effect. Elevations in ALT/AST were common during Intensification II (11% and 13%, respectively), but
were just as high during Intensification III (10% and

15%, respectively), which did not contain gemtuzumab
ozogamicin. Cardiac toxicities grade 3 did not exceed
3% in any course. One exception was hypotension, which
was probably related to sepsis. Hypotension was reported
in 2% of patients during Induction I, 3% during Induction II, 6% during Intensification I, 7% during Intensification II, 7% during Intensification III, and 12% during
HSCT. One patient became hypotensive during Induction I, and the attribution indicated probable relation to
gemtuzumab ozogamicin. For other patients, there was
no recorded attribution to gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was defined as 1)
weight gain of >10% of baseline, 2) right upper quadrant
pain or tender hepatomegaly, 3) jaundice with total bilirubin of 2 mg/dL, and 4) edema or ascites. VOD developed
in 19 patients (5.6%) during therapy (n ¼ 11) or during
follow-up (n ¼ 8), including 7 patients who received
HSCT after a relapse. Two patients were diagnosed during Intensification II, at 15 and 18 days after receiving
gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Of 9 patients with VOD during transplant, the diagnosis was made a mean of 23 days
from the beginning of that reporting period. One death
was reported to be a result of VOD that developed Day
þ16 post-HSCT.
Patients with an matched family donor were to
receive an HSCT after Intensification I. Table 5 lists
intent-to-treat survival outcomes of AAML03P1, comparing those with matched family donors (73 patients) and
those without (195 patients). Children with a matched
family donor had a lower 3-year relapse risk than those
without (18  10% vs 36  7%, P ¼ .005). The 3-year
DFS rate was 75  12% versus 57  7% (P ¼ .008), but
the difference in OS rates (80  10% vs 73  6%, P ¼
.171) was not statistically significant. Three deaths were
reported during HSCT, and the causes were listed as
infection, VOD, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
A review of treatment outcomes for patients with a
matched family donor by risk group did not reveal any
data of statistical significance.
Table 6 lists multivariate Cox analysis results for
commonly regarded prognostic factors in pediatric AML.
Analysis was restricted to include only patients with all
data available (n ¼ 305). Black patients had significantly
worse EFS and OS than patients of other racial groups,
with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.93 (P ¼ .004) and 2.48
(P<.001), respectively. Consistent with findings from
previous AML trials, univariate analysis of EFS showed
HRs of 0.55 (P ¼ .007) for those with low-risk karyotypes
compared with standard risk and 2.69 (P ¼ .002) for

multivariate analysis.
Table 7 shows the EFS and OS for the study and by
remission status after Induction I and II. The median follow-up time for patients alive at last contact was 98.8
months, with an upper range of 154.4 months. The 3year EFS rate from study entry was 53  6%, and the OS
rate was 66  5% (Fig. 2). Patients in remission after
Induction II achieved 3-year DFS and OS of 60  6%
and 72  6%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
This study showed that it is safe and feasible to add a dose
of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to an intensive induction and

766

a second dose to a postremission intensification regimen
in children with newly diagnosed AML. As expected,
infection was the most common complication. The most
common infections were sepsis and catheter-related infections. In the 2 courses in which gemtuzumab ozogamicin
was added, the rates of infection were 54% and 81%.
These high numbers reflect that the study included information on minor infections as well as those grade 3. A
comprehensive review of the AAML03P1 infection data
are underway and will be reported in a separate article.
However, the infection rates reported in the gemtuzumab
ozogamicin-containing regimens did not differ substantially from the other chemotherapy courses within this
trial. The addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not
appear to significantly prolong the time to neutrophil or
platelet recovery. The median duration of Induction I was
36 days, consistent with comparable induction regimens.16,19,25 The median duration of Intensification II
was 47 days, similar to the 42-day recovery period seen
with the CCG-2951 regimen, which used mitoxantrone
and cytarabine without gemtuzumab ozogamicin for children with AML in relapse.24
The addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not
appear to affect TRM. The observed toxic mortality rate
in Induction I was 1.5% (5 patients), which compares
favorably with the early death rates in postamendment
CCG-2961 (4.3%) and MRC 12 (4%). The TRM rate
for Intensification II was 1.8%, below the rate seen using
comparable regimens containing mitoxantrone and cytarabine, as in CCG-2951 (3%) and AAML00P2 Arm A
(5%).19,24 The primary safety objectives in this trial were
met, demonstrating that the addition of gemtuzumab
ozogamicin to established chemotherapy regimens is tolerable in pediatric patients.
Of particular concern before this study was
the incidence of VOD with gemtuzumab ozogamicin

administration. Known risk factors for VOD in those receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin include higher doses (6-9 mg/
m2), coadministration of hepatotoxic drugs such as 6-thio-

768

guanine, administration in sequential courses of therapy,
and administration within 3 months of HSCT.16,18,26,27
The observed rate of VOD in this study for those who
received HSCT (18%) did not differ significantly from
those seen with other regimens that combine gemtuzumab
ozogamicin with chemotherapy19,27 and was consistent
with the general HSCT population, in whom VOD rates
as high as 18% have been reported.21,28
This study was intended to determine the CR rate
after 2 courses of Ara-C, daunorubicin, and etoposide plus
a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the initial
course. This primary objective was met, with a cumulative
response rate of 87% (95% confidence interval, 83%-90%)
after 2 courses. The CR rates were similar to those seen
with CCG-2961, which reported a CR/PR rate of 88%.
The MRC 10 and 12 regimens, on which the backbone
chemotherapy was based, both yielded CR rates of 93%.
However, these CR rates were reported after 4 courses of
induction chemotherapy. MRC 10 yielded a 63% response
rate after Induction I and an 83% response rate after Induction II.29 MRC15 did not include enough patients on the
Ara-C, daunorubicin, and etoposide þ gemtuzumab ozogamicin arm to make a valid comparison, but the overall
induction CR rate for all patients was 83% after 2 cycles.23
The 3-year EFS and OS of AAML03P1 were at least equivalent to postamendment CCG-2961 (Fig. 2), and comparable to the 5-year EFS and OS rates reported in MRC 12
(EFS rate, 55%; OS rate, 67%). Definitive comparisons
between all of these studies are difficult because of potential
biases encountered when using historical comparisons.30

Gemtuzumab in De Novo Pediatric AML/Cooper et al

AAML03P1 showed that it is safe and feasible to
include gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and that the EFS and OS rates were
at least equivalent to those seen in CCG-2961. Future
studies will build upon our refinement of risk stratification
and molecular classification by moving novel agents and
chemotherapy combinations into phase 3 clinical trials.
