Abstract
New therapies are urgently needed for hematologic malignancies, especially in patients with relapsed acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma. We and others have previously shown that FDA-approved
statins, which are used to control hypercholesterolemia and target the mevalonate pathway (MVA), can trigger
tumor-selective apoptosis. Our goal was to identify other FDA-approved drugs that synergize with statins to
further enhance the anticancer activity of statins in vivo. Using a screen composed of other FDA approved drugs,
we identiﬁed dipyridamole, used for the prevention of cerebral ischemia, as a potentiator of statin anticancer
activity. The statin–dipyridamole combination was synergistic and induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma and
AML cell lines and primary patient samples, whereas normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not
affected. This novel combination also decreased tumor growth in vivo. Statins block HMG-CoA reductase
(HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway. Dipyridamole blunted the feedback response, which
upregulates HMGCR and HMG-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) following statin treatment. We further show that
dipyridamole inhibited the cleavage of the transcription factor required for this feedback regulation, sterol
regulatory element–binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2, SREBP2). Simultaneously targeting the MVA
pathway and its restorative feedback loop is preclinically effective against hematologic malignancies. This work
provides strong evidence for the immediate evaluation of this novel combination of FDA-approved drugs in
clinical trials. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4772–82. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies in
treating both acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and multiple
myeloma, especially in heavily pretreated and relapsed
patients. Despite recent advances in multiple myeloma treatment, it is difﬁcult to achieve progression-free survival beyond
36 months (1). In AML, survival is poor following relapse and
40% to 50% of older patients with AML and 20% to 30% of
younger patients with AML will experience primary inductive
failure (2).
Statins, potent inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in
the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, HMGCR (3), are used
in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia

(Fig. 1A). Their frequent use in the prevention of adverse
cardiovascular events has led to epidemiologic evidence
suggesting that statin use may reduce cancer incidence (4–
6). In hematologic malignancies, it has been shown that
statins can trigger tumor-speciﬁc apoptosis (7–11). These
apoptotic effects have been attributed to direct inhibition
of HMGCR in tumor cells followed by depletion of fundamental MVA-derived end products such as isoprenoids
and cholesterol (9, 12–14). In tumor cells, dysregulation of
the MVA pathway has been postulated to be responsible
for the observed therapeutic index. Higher tumor expression levels of HMGCR and other MVA pathway enzymes
are associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival in
patients with cancer (15, 16). Dysregulation of the MVA
pathway's restorative sterol feedback response occurs in
both multiple myeloma (8) and AML (17, 18). Taken
together, dysregulation of the MVA pathway in hematologic malignancies provides a strong rationale for statin
therapy.
Early dose-ﬁnding prospective clinical trials established
that statins can be tolerated at concentrations exceeding
cholesterol-lowering doses, which range from 20 to 80 mg/d
(19, 20). High doses of statins can be tolerated in the clinical
cancer setting, but the ideal dosing regimen remains unclear
as efﬁcacy has been observed with high (20) and cholesterollowering (21, 22) doses.

Statins have also been safely combined with the standardof-care therapy regimens in patients with AML and multiple
myeloma without serious side effects in inductive, consolidation, and maintenance therapy (20, 23). While this
approach has shown some promise, there remain many
nonresponsive patients (24), highlighting an urgent need to
develop novel synergistic combinatorial approaches utilizing
statin chemotherapy.
Building on promising results of statins as anticancer agents
in AML and multiple myeloma, we conducted a pharmacologic
screen of FDA-approved drugs in combination with statins to
identify novel combinations with anticancer efﬁcacy in hematologic malignancies. The screen identiﬁed dipyridamole, a

combination, synergistic and capable of inducing apoptosis at
low micromolar doses in AML and multiple myeloma cells,
slowed tumor growth in a leukemia xenograft model and
induced apoptosis in primary AML patient samples. Mechanistically, dipyridamole increased statin efﬁcacy by blunting
the MVA restorative feedback response through blocking the
regulatory cleavage of the transcription factor, SREBP2. Taken
together, these ﬁndings have not only uncovered a role for
inhibiting MVA pathway feedback regulation as a mechanism
to potentiate the anticancer efﬁcacy of statins but also provided a strong rationale for the immediate utility of statin–

dipyridamole therapy for patients with AML and multiple
myeloma.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and compounds
Multiple myeloma cell lines were maintained in RPMI1640 medium and AML cell lines in Alpha Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium (aMEM) and Iscove Modiﬁed Dulbecco Medium
(IMDM). Media were supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO)
and penicillin–streptomycin. OCI-AML2 and OCI-AML3
cells were established by and obtained from Drs. McCulloch
and Mark Minden (the AML cell lines are proprietary to
UHN and available through the German Tissue bank DSMZ)
and are veriﬁed by Dr. Mark Minden every 6 months using
STR-I proﬁling. KMS11 and LP1 cells, obtained from
Dr. Suzanne Trudel (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,
Toronto, ON, Canada) are originally from JCBR and DSMZ
cell banks, respectively. The cell lines are authenticated by
DNA ﬁngerprinting and multiplex PCR and tested for
authenticity every 6 months by Dr. Suzanne Trudel. Cells
were incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2, and cell lines were
routinely conﬁrmed to be mycoplasma-free (MycoAlert
Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza). Atorvastatin calcium
(21 CEC Pharmaceuticals LTD) and ﬂuvastatin (US Biologicals) were dissolved in ethanol. Dipyridamole was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma).
Primary cells
Primary AML patient samples were obtained from consenting patients. PBSCs were obtained from healthy volunteers
donating cells for allotransplantation and were granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)-mobilized. Mononuclear
cells were fractioned by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation. Primary cells were cultured in IMDM medium supplemented with 20% FBS and 5% 5367-conditioned medium.
Frozen primary cells were thawed and within 2 to 10 hours
treated for 48 hours. PBSCs were obtained fresh and treated as
indicated and as previously reported (8). Use and collection of
human tissue for this study was approved by the University
Health Network Institutional Review Board (Toronto, ON,
Canada).
Chemical screen for cytotoxic drugs
Plates (96-well) of KMS11 cells (20,000 cells per well) were
treated with aliquots of a chemical library (25) of 100 drugs
dissolved in DMSO (3–50 mmol/L) using a Biomek FX Laboratory Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter). One plate
had been pretreated with 3.5 mmol/L of atorvastatin. Following
72 hours of incubation, MTS activity was assessed as previously
described (25).
MTT, TUNEL, and Annexin V apoptosis assays
MTT assay (26) is a colorimetric assay measuring the
reduction of the MTT substrate by oxidoreductase enzymes
into formazan and is commonly used as an indirect readout of
cellular viability. Brieﬂy, 2  105 to 3  105 cells/mL were plated
in 96-well plates and after 24 hours treated as indicated for 48

hours. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) values
were computed from dose–response curves using Prism (v5.0,
GraphPad Software). For TUNEL assays, 2.5  105 cells/mL
were seeded in 6-well plates and treated for 48 hours as
indicated. Cells were ﬁxed in ethanol, and staining was
performed using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) according to the
manufacturer's instructions (APO-BRDU Apoptosis Kit,
Phoenix Flow Systems). Annexin V apoptosis assays (Biovision) were carried out as per the manufacturer's protocol.
Cells were analyzed for apoptosis by FACS (FACSCalibur
cytometer, BD Biosciences).
Drug combination studies
Synergy between statins and dipyridamole was evaluated
using the combination index (CI; ref. 27). Dose–response
curves were generated for statins and dipyridamole alone and
in combination at a constant ratio following compound exposure for 48 hours and assessed by MTT assay. CalcuSyn
software (biosoft) was used to evaluate synergy using the
median-effect model.
Immunoblotting
A total of 2.5  10 5 cells/mL were seeded in 6-well tissue
culture plates and treated as indicated. For PARP (PARP1),
SREBP2, total and unprocessed Rap1A detection, cells
were washed with PBS and lysed using boiling hot SDS
lysis buffer (1.1% SDS, 11% glycerol, 0.1 mol/L Tris, pH 6.8)
with 10% b-mercaptoethanol. For HMGCR detection, cells
were washed with PBS and lysed as previously described
(15). Blots were probed with anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-PARP (Cell Signaling), anti-Rap1,
anti-total and unprocessed Rap1A (Santa Cruz), antiSREBP2 (BD Pharmingen), and anti-HMGCR (monoclonal
A9, in-house).
Leukemia xenograft models
Severe-combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) male mice (7to 9-week-old), obtained from and housed in the Ontario
Cancer Institute animal colony, were subcutaneously injected
with 106 OCI-AML2 cells. When tumors became palpable (15
mm3), mice were randomized and treated daily with 120 mg/kg
dipyridamole administered intraperitoneally (i.p.; 5 mg/mL
dipyridamole in 50 mg/mL polyethylene glycol 600, and 2
mg/mL tartaric acid), 50 mg/kg atorvastatin administered
orally, a combination of dipyridamole and atorvastatin, or
vehicle. Tumors were measured every 2 days using digital
calipers and tumor volume was calculated using the following
formula: (tumor length  width2)/2. Animal work was carried
out with the approval of the Princess Margaret Hospital ethics
review board in accordance to the regulations of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care.
Assessment of dipyridamole levels in serum
Levels of dipyridamole in serum were determined as previously described by spectroﬂuorometry using differences in the
ﬂuorescence of dipyridamole between acidic and basic conditions (28). For standard curves, dipyridamole control solutions

SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices).

Results
A screen of pharmacologically active drugs identiﬁes
dipyridamole as a potentiator of the anticancer effects of
atorvastatin
To identify a combination of drugs with novel anticancer
activities using an unbiased approach, we screened atorvastatin in combination with a library of 100 on- and off-patent

drugs available in Canada (Supplementary Table S1), composed of antimicrobials and metabolic regulators (25). Wellknown pharmacokinetic proﬁles, high achievable plasma concentrations, and a wide therapeutic index characterized the
drugs in the library. The KMS11 multiple myeloma cell line was
treated for 72 hours with either a sublethal dose of atorvastatin
(0%–20% effect on MTS activity), each of the 100 drugs alone, or
each in combination with atorvastatin. The combination of
dipyridamole, a well-known anti-platelet agent and atorvastatin was found to decrease MTS activity (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Validation in AML and multiple myeloma cell lines

showed that dipyridamole was capable of signiﬁcantly potentiating the anticancer effects of atorvastatin (Fig. 1B). Dipyridamole alone, used at a physiologically achievable concentration of 5 mmol/L, did not have signiﬁcant effects on MTT
activity (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Statins are often used
interchangeably but structural differences of each statin
governing key facets such as metabolism and lipophilicity
impact not only their cholesterol-lowering efﬁcacies but also
anticancer effects. We therefore also evaluated ﬂuvastatin,
another lipophilic statin, and found that dipyridamole was
also able to potentiate its anticancer effects (Supplementary
Fig. S1C).
The combination of statins and dipyridamole is
synergistically antiproliferative and induces apoptosis
in AML and multiple myeloma cell lines and primary
patient cells
We next evaluated whether the statin–dipyridamole combination was synergistic. We treated cells with increasing
concentrations of statin and dipyridamole alone and in combination. Synergy at multiple effect levels was evaluated using
the CI (27). The combination of atorvastatin or ﬂuvastatin with
dipyridamole synergistically decreased MTT activity at multiple effective concentrations in all AML and multiple myeloma
cell lines (Fig. 1C).
The limitation of colorimetric assays such as the MTT assay
is reliance on mitochondrial enzymes whose rates of conver-

sion of the MTT substrates are used as an indirect measure of
cell viability. As these assays do not directly assess apoptosis
(29), we chose representative cell lines from the AML and
multiple myeloma panel and measured apoptosis using
TUNEL and PARP cleavage. We treated KMS11 (Fig. 2A, left)
and OCI-AML3 (Fig. 2B, left) cells with atorvastatin and/or
dipyridamole and found that there was a dramatic induction of
apoptosis when atorvastatin was combined with dipyridamole
with no effect of either drug alone. The apoptotic effect was
abrogated with the co-administration of MVA and therefore
was deemed to result speciﬁcally from the inhibition of
HMGCR, the target of statins. Cleavage of PARP also occurred
in KMS11 and OCI-AML3 cells (Fig. 2A and B, right, respectively) following exposure to the atorvastatin–dipyridamole
combination.
To determine whether primary AML cells are sensitive to the
combination, we exposed patient samples to statins and/or
dipyridamole for 48 hours. Cell death was measured using
Annexin V/propidium iodide (AV/PI) staining. As compared
with TUNEL and PARP cleavage, the AV/PI stain requires fewer
cells. Primary cells from patients with AML were treated with
multiple doses of statins and dipyridamole (Table 1). The
statin–dipyridamole combination signiﬁcantly induced apoptosis in primary AML cells (Fig. 2C and D). Death was dosedependent and observed at similar doses used in cell lines. The
effects of the combination were minimal in PBSCs (Fig. 2E).
Taken together, these data underscore the therapeutic utility of

Statin–Dipyridamole Potentiate Tumor Cell Apoptosis

the statin–dipyridamole combination in AML and patient
samples.
The combination of statins and dipyridamole delays
tumor growth in leukemia xenografts
To evaluate the statin–dipyridamole combination in vivo, we
treated SCID mice harboring established xenografts of OCIAML2 cells. We chose to orally administer atorvastatin because
this is the route of delivery for humans. In addition, atorvastatin has a longer serum half-life than other statins (30) and has
previously demonstrated in vivo efﬁcacy (8). Gastric pH levels
differ between mice and humans, and the highly acidic pH of
mice has been reported to impair the oral bioavailability of
dipyridamole (31) and so we intraperitoneally administered
dipyridamole. The dipyridamole concentration in serum of
mice treated with dipyridamole reached micromolar concentrations (Fig. 3A) and was comparable with the doses used
in our cell culture studies. The combination of atorvastatin
and dipyridamole signiﬁcantly decreased ﬁnal tumor weight
(Fig. 3B) and tumor volume (Fig. 3C).
Dipyridamole enhances the effects of statin-induced
MVA pathway inhibition
The mechanism of dipyridamole's proapoptotic activity in
combination with statins remained unclear. Dipyridamole at
the low micromolar concentrations used to potentiate statininduced apoptosis has no anticancer efﬁcacy as a single agent.
Furthermore, as the statin–dipyridamole apoptosis was reversible by the concomitant addition of MVA, we wondered
whether dipyridamole was inﬂuencing the mechanism of
statin-induced death at the molecular level. The isoprenylation
arm of the MVA pathway (Fig. 1A) is functionally critical for
statins to trigger apoptosis of tumor cells (13, 32, 33). We ﬁrst
tested whether dipyridamole contributed to the inhibition of
isoprenylation by assessing protein levels of unprocessed
Rap1A, a small GTPase that is geranylgeranyled (34). Addition
of dipyridamole increased statin-induced accumulation of
unprocessed Rap1A in KMS11 and OCI-AML3 cells (Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Fig. S2) shown 16 hours posttreatment but
also evident at later time points (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Addition of dipyridamole also increased statin-induced accumulation of unprocessed Rap1A in LP1 and OCI-AML2 cells
(Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S2C, respectively). Another
reported consequence of MVA depletion and the downstream
isoprenylation block is the transcriptional upregulation of
RHOB (35), a member of the family of small GTPases involved
in cytoskeletal motility, vesicle trafﬁcking, and cell adhesion
signaling. Consistent with our Rap1A results, we further saw
that dipyridamole potentiated statin-induced RhoB mRNA
increases in KMS11 and OCI-AML3 cells (Fig. 4B). The dependence of RhoB upregulation on MVA depletion was conﬁrmed
by using apoptosis-inducing doses of statins, which also caused
similar RhoB mRNA increases as observed with the statin–
dipyridamole combination (Fig. 4B).
We next investigated whether the role of dipyridamole as a
reported P-glycoprotein (ABCB1, P-gp) inhibitor (36) could be
potentiating statin-induced apoptosis. P-gp is an ATP-binding
cassette transporter; its overexpression in cancer cells can

mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 OCI-AML2 cells. After

contribute to efﬂux of drugs leading to treatment resistance.
We determined whether dipyridamole could modulate P-gp by
analyzing a pair of MM 8226 cells lines (37), one parental (8226)
and one overexpressing P-gp (8226DOX; Supplementary Fig.

were generated with and without dipyridamole. The doxorubicin IC50 values in the 8226DOX cells were in the high

micromolar range upon addition of dipyridamole compared
with the nanomolar range in the parental 8226 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). If dipyridamole were blocking P-gp, then the
IC50 value of doxorubicin would decrease in the 8226DOX cells,
but this was not evident at the concentrations used in this
study. Thus, evidence shows that dipyridamole does not inhibit
P-gp, supporting the concept that dipyridamole does not
contribute to the observed synergy by blocking statin efﬂux.
Taken together, we have demonstrated that dipyridamole
potentiates statin-induced apoptosis by blocking protein isoprenylation in a P-gp–independent manner.
Dipyridamole suppresses the sterol feedback loop
through inhibition of SREBP2 cleavage
We were intrigued that the LP1 cells also showed a strong
growth reduction in response to the statin–dipyridamole
combination (Fig. 1B and C). The LP1 cells have been previously characterized as being insensitive to the proapoptotic
effects of statins (32) and this was molecularly linked to a
robust upregulation of HMGCR and other sterol-responsive
genes following statin exposure (8). In response to sterol
depletion, as occurs following statin treatment, feedback
mediated by the transcription factor SREBP2 results in the
transcriptional induction of sterol-responsive genes such as
HMGCR and HMGCS1 (38). Treatment of the LP1 cells with the
statin–dipyridamole combination resulted in signiﬁcant apoptosis induction not achieved with higher statin doses (Fig. 5A).
Remarkably, the HMGCR upregulation observed with statin
treatment was decreased upon treatment with the statin–
dipyridamole combination (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig.
S4A), a phenomenon occurring at early time points during
treatment and before any signiﬁcant apoptosis induction. As
expected, exposure to statins also caused an induction of
HMGCS1 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR;

4778

LDLr) and this increase was also suppressed with dipyridamole
co-treatment (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S4B). HMGCS1
protein levels were similarly affected (Fig. 5D). As SREBP2
mRNA levels remained unaffected by concomitant statin–
dipyridamole treatment when compared with the statin-only
treatment (Fig. 5C), we examined whether SREBP2 cleavage,
which occurs before translocation into the nucleus, was affected by the statin–dipyridamole combination. Indeed, the statin–dipyridamole combination inhibited statin-induced
SREBP2 cleavage (Fig. 5E). HMGCR and HMGCS1 statininduced upregulation was also observed in AML cells and was
similarly decreased upon treatment with the statin–dipyridamole combination as was SREBP2 cleavage (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Importantly, the statin–dipyridamole combination
prevented the upregulation of HMGCR mRNA and protein in
primary AML cells responsive to the combination treatment
(Fig. 5G). Taken together, we have demonstrated that targeting
the MVA pathway using statins, while simultaneously suppressing the feedback whose purpose is to restore the depleted
MVA-derived end products, is an effective antitumor therapeutic strategy.

Discussion
Statins demonstrate efﬁcacy in the clinical cancer setting
including hematologic malignancies (20, 24). Although the
administration of higher than cholesterol-lowering ﬂuvastatin
or atorvastatin doses has not yet been evaluated in patients
with cancer, the tolerability observed with other statins suggests that elevated doses will be similarly tolerated and that
low micromolar range (2–5 mmol/L) doses used in our cell
culture studies could be achievable in humans. Evidence shows
that even cholesterol-lowering doses can decrease tumor
burden in patients with cancer (21, 22). Thus, the optimal
dose of statins to use for cancer patient treatment remains

Statin–Dipyridamole Potentiate Tumor Cell Apoptosis

Figure 5. Dipyridamole prevents the statin-induced upregulation of HMGCR through inhibition of SREBP2 cleavage. A, LP1 cells were treated as
indicated with ﬂuvastatin (Fluv.) and 5 mmol/L of dipyridamole (DP) for 48 hours, and apoptosis was evaluated using AV staining. B, LP1 cells were
treated with 4 mmol/L of ﬂuvastatin (Fluv.) and 5 mmol/L dipyridamole (DP) for 8 and 16 hours, and RNA was harvested for HMGCR expression measured
relative to GAPDH by real-time PCR. C, LP1 cells were treated with 10 mmol/L ﬂuvastatin (Fluv.) and 5 mmol/L dipyridamole (DP) for 12 hours and RNA
was harvested for HMGCS1, LDLr, and SREBP2 expression measured relative to GAPDH. Changes in mRNA expression are shown relative to

unclear, yet evidence strongly suggests that effective dosing
can be achieved in vivo.
Like all anticancer agents, it is optimal to administer drugs
in multimodal and combinatorial treatment strategies to
increase tumor-speciﬁc anticancer effects. Here, we provide
a complimentary approach of combining statins with an
already FDA-approved agent in the treatment of hematologic
malignancies. Dipyridamole has been used as part of antithrombotic therapy for decades and its pharmacology has been
thoroughly investigated. Dipyridamole is constantly being
reformulated to maximize systemic exposure and extended
release formulations have a reported half-life of 13.6 hours

following typical 200 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) dosing with steadystate peak plasma concentrations of 1.0–4.0 mg/mL (2.0–7.9
mmol/L; ref. 39). However, much higher dipyridamole doses
have been tolerated in humans as reported from overdose case
reports (40), suggesting that dosing could potentially be
elevated.
Our apoptosis assays in primary cells demonstrated that
the combination of statin and dipyridamole was capable of
inducing apoptosis in primary AML patient samples but not
in primary normal PBSCs. Ultimately, leukemic progenitor
colony formation assays using patients with AML and
healthy donor samples would have further evaluated the

therapeutic efﬁcacy and potential hemotoxic effects of the
statin–dipyridamole combination, as these are long-term
assays that more accurately recapitulate the microenvironment of the disease. However, clinical studies have been
conducted that show that the statin–dipyridamole combination is safe and well tolerated in humans when assessed
for effects on cardiovascular protection (41) and renal
function (42). Therefore, we predict that a safe therapeutic
window exists as this combination has been previously safely
administered to humans.
Vulnerability of tumor cells to MVA pathway inhibition
through statin administration has been attributed to dependence on MVA-derived end products, particularly those
utilized for protein isoprenylation. Increased demands for
such end products from tumor cells are met through dysregulation of the MVA pathway at multiple levels. The natural
homeostatic feedback mechanism triggered in response to
MVA pathway inhibition can inhibit statin efﬁcacy (8) by
inducing genes such as HMGCR and HMGCS1. Blocking this
restorative feedback response through the addition of dipyridamole broadens statins' therapeutic window in tumor cells
such as the LP1 cells where the feedback response was
previously shown to be an impediment to statin-induced
cell death (8). Recently, a window of opportunity clinical trial
in patients with breast cancer demonstrated that antitumor
responses in patients treated with atorvastatin were correlated with basal HMGCR expression levels (43). Interestingly,
HMGCR expression was also elevated post-atorvastatin
treatment, leading us to postulate that statin efﬁcacy might
also be increased with concomitant block of this feedback
response in vivo as we observed in our ex vivo analyses of
AML primary samples. Our results strongly suggest that
dipyridamole may be immediately used in combination with
statins in cancer patient clinical trials to directly evaluate
the hypothesis that blocking the feedback response to
statins potentiates anticancer efﬁcacy.
Our data suggest that following statin challenge, dipyridamole inhibits the feedback response by blocking SREBP2
cleavage and nuclear accumulation, thereby resulting in
decreased HMGCR and HMGCS1 mRNA expression, a
hallmark of the statin and dipyridamole apoptotic
response (Supplementary Fig. S6). How dipyridamole contributes to the inhibition of SREBP2 cleavage remains to be
elucidated. At the molecular level, dipyridamole is known
to inhibit the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1;
ref. 44) and glucose uptake (45). Also, dipyridamole is a
multi-isoform phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor with
varying degrees of inhibition reported for PDE 5, 6, 7, 8,
10, 11 (46) and has an ability to increase both cAMP and
cGMP levels in cell culture and in vivo. It is unknown which,
if any, of these antithrombotic activities play a role in the
potentiation of statin-induced death in tumor cells. Dipyridamole been shown to potentiate classical chemotherapeutic drugs mainly through P-gp modulation and by
blocking nucleoside transport (47). Recently, it was shown
that dipyridamole alone delays tumor growth in breast
cancer xenografts (48), but in our hands, using low micromolar concentrations, dipyridamole did not have appreci-

able anticancer activity as a single agent. This is in line with
the observation that dipyridamole's antiproliferative
effects were only observed when tumor cells were simultaneously challenged with statin, thereby triggering the
feedback loop that was suppressed by the addition of
dipyridamole.
The MVA pathway is targetable in many other tumor
types and the statin–dipyridamole combination is likely
applicable in other settings. Our work suggests that by
combining statins with other agents that block SREBP2
activity antitumor efﬁcacy will be increased. Importantly,
we have demonstrated that by effectively dampening a
pathway's restorative feedback loop, tumor apoptosis can
be maximized. This reinforces the emerging broader concept
in cancer treatment strategies that suggests blocking the
feedback response to the anticancer agent under investigation can potentiate therapeutic activity and efﬁcacy (49). In
summary, we have identiﬁed a synergistic combination of
two FDA-approved drugs that is preclinically effective in
treating AML and multiple myeloma. These studies may
serve as a foundation for developing a phase I clinical trial
involving the combination of statins and dipyridamole for
the treatment of AML and multiple myeloma.
