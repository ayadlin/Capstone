Abstract
Gliomas are the most commonly diagnosed primary tumors of the central nervous
system (CNS). Median times of survival are dismal regardless of the treatment
approach, underlying the need to develop more effective therapies. Modulation of
the immune system is a promising strategy as innate and adaptive immunity play
important roles in cancer progression. Glioma associated microglia and macrophages
(GAMs) can comprise over 30% of the cells in glioma biopsies. Gliomas secrete
cytokines that suppress the anti-tumorigenic properties of GAMs, causing them to
secrete factors that support the tumor’s spread and growth. Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1)
is a transmembrane receptor that in mice both amplifies pro-angiogenic signaling
in the tumor microenvironment and affects behavior of innate immune cells. Using
a Cre-lox system, we generated mice that lack expression of Nrp1 in GAMs. We
demonstrate, using an in vivo orthotopic glioma model, that tumors in mice with
Nrp1-deficient GAMs exhibit less vascularity, grow at a slower pace, and are populated
by increased numbers of anti-tumorigenic GAMs. Moreover, glioma survival times in
mice with Nrp1-deficient GAMs were significantly longer. Treating wild-type mice
with a small molecule inhibitor of Nrp1’s b1 domain, EG00229, which we show here
is selective for Nrp1 over Nrp2, yielded an identical outcome. Nrp1-deficient or
EG00229-treated wild-type microglia exhibited a shift towards anti-tumorigenicity
as evident by altered inflammatory marker profiles in vivo and decreased SMAD2/3
activation when conditioned in the presence of glioma-derived factors. These results
provide support for the proposal that pharmacological inhibition of Nrp1 constitutes
a potential strategy for suppressing glioma progression.

Introduction

incur frequent complications including seizures,
fluctuating neurological symptoms, and adverse effects of
chemotherapy. Thus, there is a substantial need to identify
more effective and specific pharmacological targets for
treatment. Apart from cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic
therapies, modulation of the immune system is a promising
strategy, as innate and adaptive immunity are implicated in
playing important roles in cancer progression [3].
Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), a cell-surface transmembrane

of clinical management strategy, is dismal, averaging
between 12 to 15 months [2]. Current treatment modalities

signaling pathways, has received significant attention as
a potential therapeutic target in glioma as well as in other
cancer subtypes. Increased Nrp1 expression in glioma
biopsies, specifically in glioma tumor cells, correlates
with increased malignancy [4], whereas reducing Nrp1
expression in glioma cells suppresses migration [5],
proliferation and survival in vitro, and stem cell viability
and tumor growth in vivo [6, 7].
Nrp1 has also been shown to function as a coreceptor for VEGF-R on macrophages in the periphery
in mouse tumor models, where it plays a key role in the
accumulation of immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic
macrophages at sites of tumor hypoxia in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and lung carcinoma, [8].
Microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS,
can comprise over 30% of the cells in glioma biopsies [9].
Gliomas are known to secrete cytokines that suppress the
anti-tumorigenicity of microglia and other macrophages,
causing them in turn to secrete factors that support tumor
growth and spread [10]. However, it is also known that
these glioma-associated microglia and macrophages
(GAMs) can undergo an anti-tumorigenic shift depending
on the microenvironment and the cytokines they are
exposed to [11, 12]. Gliomas have been shown to express
high levels of TGF-β, VEGFA, HGF, and Sema3a, which
promote tumor growth [13], neo-vascularization [14],
invasiveness [15], and dispersal [16]. Important to how
the receptors for these cytokines conduct signaling is
their co-receptor Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), which amplifies the
activation of their downstream effector pathways [17-22].
These receptors are expressed by macrophages as well
[23, 24] and likely have an effect on their activity within
tumor micro-environments enriched in their ligands.
Our group has shown that Nrp1 plays an important
role in microglial activation and polarization [25]. More
specifically, we have shown [25] that pro-tumorigenic
M2 polarization of microglia can be blocked by a small
molecule inhibitor of Nrp1’s b1 domain, EG00229 [26].
The b1 domain binds and amplifies signaling through the
VEGF-A and TGFβ pathways ([26, 27]). Based on the
above information, our group hypothesized that genetic
ablation of Nrp1 from microglia and macrophages
populating the glioma microenvironment would lead to
a decrease in the capacity of the microenvironment to
promote their pro-tumorigenic polarization and thus result
in reduced tumor growth.
We demonstrate here using a syngeneic glioma
model that tumors develop more slowly in mice in which
Nrp1 has been genetically ablated from their microglia
and macrophages. This decrease in tumor growth is
correlated with an increase in GAM density, decreased
neovascularization, and increased anti-tumorigenic
polarization of the GAMs populating the tumors. In line
with these findings, we find similar disease outcomes in
mice administered an inhibitor of Nrp1’s b1 domain. Our
findings support the proposal that targeting Nrp1 may be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a promising therapeutic strategy for malignant glioma
through the promotion of anti-tumorigenic polarization
of GAMs, in addition to suppressing Nrp1’s previously
characterized roles in amplifying angiogenic and
proliferative signaling in endothelial and glioma-derived
cancer cells, respectively.

Results
Glioma associated microglia and macrophages
express Nrp1
A critical factor in the progression of gliomas is
their interaction with the surrounding tissue and cells.
The tumor microenvironment directs and modulates the
growth and metastatic propensity of glioma cells [34].
It has been shown that Nrp1 expression by tumor cells
is correlated with the degree of biologic aggression of
human gliomas [4, 20] but it is not known whether Nrp1
is also expressed by macrophages within the human tumor
microenvironment. We thus investigated whether gliomaassociated microglia and macrophages (GAMs) express
Nrp1 using human tumor biopsies. Nrp1 expression was
detected by immunofluorescence in Iba1-positive GAMs
in glioma biopsies of varying grades (Figure 1).

Glioma growth is impaired in mice with Nrp1deficient microglia/macrophages and mice
treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of Nrp1,
EG00229
Since genetic depletion of Nrp1 from tumorassociated macrophages has been reported to decrease
tumor growth in the periphery for pancreatic and lung
tumor xenografts in mice [8], we next investigated whether
CNS glioma tumor burden is different in wild type (wt)
mice compared to mice with Nrp1-deficient microglia and
macrophages. We generated mice that constitutively lack
Nrp1 expression in microglia and macrophages (Nrp1MgKO)
by crossing mice with lox-p sites flanking exon 2 of the
Nrp1 gene (Nrp1fl/fl) to mice expressing Cre recombinase
under the Csf1R promoter [30, 31]. For the disease model,
we used the GL261 glioma cell line, which was derived
from a chemically-induced C57BL/6 murine astrocytoma
[28] and bears mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 and
the oncogene KRas [35]. We previously stably-transfected
this cell line with eGFP, generating GL261-eGFP, which
was characterized in culture and in an in vivo glioma
model [29]. Nrp1 mRNA expression was detected in the
GL261-eGFP cell line and in wt microglia using primers
designed to amplify a region of exon 2 that is excised by
Cre recombination, but undetectable in Nrp1MgKO microglia
(Supplementary Figure 1). Additionally, Csf1R expression

relative to Iba1 expression, in the CNS of wild type and
Nrp1MgKO mice remained unchanged (Supplementary
Figure 1)
Gliomas were introduced into wt and Nrp1MgKO mice
and allowed to engraft and develop. At 15 and 20 days
after tumor initiation, tumor volumes were significantly
lower in the Nrp1MgKO mice (Figure 2A, left column;
D). Blood vessel density was visualized using an antiCD31 antibody and vessel luminal areas summated and
quantified from random points throughout the tumors.
Gliomas in Nrp1MgKO were found to have significantly
decreased blood vessel luminal area relative to tumors
in wt mice (Figure 2A middle and right columns, E).
Additionally, tumor tissue from both genotypes was
populated by prominent numbers of Csf1R expressing
cells (Figure 2B). F4/80 GAMs in tumor tissue of wt mice
stained positive for Nrp1 expression, while Nrp1 was not
detectable in GAMs of Nrp1MgKO mice (Figure 2C).
To examine whether Nrp1 deficiency in GAMs
had an effect on survival time, tumors were allowed to
engraft in wt and Nrp1MgKO mice and disease outcome
was tracked until the terminal stages of the disease. All
mice within the wt group were euthanized by 30 days
PGI due to ethical concerns, whereas two mice from the
Nrp1MgKO group survived until day 50, at which point they
were euthanized (Figure 2F). Nrp1MgKO mice displayed a
significant increase in survival time based on a MantelCox log rank test (p = 0.0172, Figure 2F).
We then investigated whether pharmacologic
inhibition of Nrp1 in wild-type mice with EG00229,
which blocks the b1 domain of Nrp1, would have similar
effects on tumor growth [26]. Pharmacokinetic evaluation
of EG00229 in mice revealed a relatively short half-life of
35 min (Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting that focal
delivery via osmotic mini-pump would be the preferred
route of delivery. We established that intraperitoneal
administration of EG00229 at a concentration of 75 µM
had no overt adverse effects in mice (data not shown)
and used this concentration for loading the osmotic minipumps.
Gliomas were introduced in wt mice and EG00229
delivered directly to the glioma injection site via a cannula
connected to the pump for 15 or 20 days. Cannulas
delivered the drug at a rate of 9.337µg dissolved in 0.25μL
vehicle/hour to an estimated volume of distribution of
approximately 20mm3, based off similar studies [36]. Due
to these measurements, we estimated the drug’s resulting
concentration in the tumor tissue to be approximately
1 µM. We established that mice treated with saline had
similar tumor burden to wt mice (Supplementary Figure 3).
Gliomas were found to be significantly smaller and have
decreased CD31+ vessel luminal area in mice administered
EG00229 relative to those that developed in control wt
mice (Figure 2A, 2D, 2E). To investigate whether delayed
administration of the drug could still affect tumor volume,
tumor development and vessel luminal area were assessed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and found to still be significantly reduced at 15 days-post
glioma induction (PGI) when EG00229 was administered
8 days PGI (Figure 2D, 2E). No significant difference in
tumor growth or vascularity was observed between tumors
from Nrp1MgKO mice or EG00229-treated wt mice at any
time point (Figure 2D, 2E).

EG00229 binds specifically to Nrp1
The other Neuropilin isoform, Nrp2, is structurally
similar to Nrp1 and has signaling roles in the CNS and
other organ systems that partially overlap but are also
distinct from those of Nrp1. To assess the selectivity of
EG00229 towards Nrp1, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) was
performed. EG00229 exhibited clear binding to a single
site on Nrp1b1 domain with associated Kd of 0.2 μM, ΔH
= -20640 µCal/mol and ΔS = -42.4 (µCal/mol)/K (Figure
3A). In contrast, interaction between EG00229 and the
Nrp2b1 domain was not detected (Figure 3B), indicating
that EG00229 specifically interacts with Nrp1.

Gliomas in mice with Nrp1-deficient microglia/
macrophages and mice treated with EG00229
exhibit
increased
microglial/macrophage
infiltration
Although pharmacologic inhibition of Nrp1 also
targets tumor- and endothelial-Nrp1, genetic ablation of
Nrp1 solely from microglia and macrophages decreased
tumor volume and vascularity to the extent seen with the
pharmacological treatment (Figure 2), suggesting that a
critical role for Nrp1 in this setting is via signaling to/
from the GAMs. To investigate whether ablating Nrp1
expression in GAMs alters their effect on the tumor or the
tumor environment, tumor sections were immunostained
using the microglia/macrophage marker, Iba1. Gliomas in
wt mice were characterized by an Iba1+ cell density that
was relatively uniform throughout the tumor (Figure 4A).
In contrast, gliomas in Nrp1MgKO mice were encompassed
by a dense layer of Iba1+ cells not observed in the wt
mice (Figure 4A). Immunoblotting of crude tumor lysates
yielded similar results: higher levels of the microglia/
macrophage marker F4/80 were present in Nrp1MgKO
tumor lysates, accompanied by increased expression of
TSPO, a marker of neuro-inflammation (Supplementary
Figure 4). GAM density was similarly increased in the
rims of tumors from Nrp1MgKO mice at 15 and 20 days of
the disease course relative to GAM density in wt mice
(Figure 4). Additionally, GAM density was found to be
significantly elevated in the core of tumors in Nrp1MgKO
mice although the difference was most profound at the
rim (Supplementary Figure 4). GAM density within the
tumor rims of EG00229-treated wt mice was, likewise,
significantly elevated relative to the density of GAMs in
the tumor rim in untreated wt mice (Figure 4B, 4C) and

macrophages [37]. This ratio was significantly higher (i.e.,
shifted towards M1) in populations of GAMs populating
tumor rims in Nrp1MgKO mice at days 15 and 20 days PGI
relative to wt mice at the same time points (Figure 5).
Additionally, the percentage of CD11b+ GAMs expressing
high levels of CD86 and the ratio of GAMs expressing
high levels of CD86 relative to those expressing high
levels of CD206 were significantly higher in whole
tumor extract of Nrp1MgKO mice (Figure 5). Expression of
TSPO, a general marker for inflammatory activation, was
significantly elevated in GAMs of Nrp1MgKO mice relative
to those of wt mice at 15 days PGI (Supplementary Figure
4). GAMs from tumors in wt mice treated with EG00229
for variable amounts of time were similarly found to
have an elevated ratio of CD86 to CD206 expression in
comparison to GAMs populating tumors in untreated
mice (Figure 5). Additionally, TSPO expression in GAMs
was significantly higher in gliomas in mice treated with
EG00229 relative to wt mice (Supplementary Figure 4).

Nrp1-deficient microglia/macrophages and those
in EG00229 treated mice exhibit increased antitumorigenic polarization
Since macrophages are frequently polarized
to a pro-tumorigenic phenotype that supports tumor
vascularization and growth, we sought to understand
how an increase in GAM density surrounding and in
tumors of Nrp1MgKO and EG00229-treated wt mice could
be inversely correlated with these outcomes. As Nrp1dependent pathways can play a role in the behavior of
tumor-associated macrophages in the periphery, we
examined the phenotypic state of the GAMs by assessing
them for expression of CD86, CD206, and TSPO, which
are markers of inflammatory status. Relative expression
of these markers was quantified by calculating colocalization between the markers and either F4/80 or Iba1
as markers of the GAMs. The ratio of CD86 to CD206 is
used as an indicator of the ratio of M1 (inflammatory, anti-

Nrp1 depletion or pharmacologic inhibition in
microglia alters their association with gliomaderived cells and increases their anti-tumorigenic
polarization in the presence of glioma-derived
cytokines

Having noted differences in the polarity of wt
and Nrp1MgKO GAMs in vivo, we investigated whether
microglia and GL261-eGFP interact differently in vitro
depending on the presence or absence of Nrp1 signaling by
microglia. GL261-eGFP cells were plated onto basement
membrane extract in the presence of wt or Nrp1MgKO
microglia and they were grown together for 5 days (Figure
6A). GL261eGFP cells assembled into spheres while
nearby microglia were attracted into these spheres (Figure
6B). Notably, as Nrp1MgKO microglia congregated around
GL261-eGFP spheres, the fluorescence detected from
the GL261-eGFP cells populating the spheres decreased.
This was not observed when wt microglia migrated into
GL261-eGFP spheres (Figure 6B), supporting the idea
that Nrp1MgKO microglia associate differently with gliomaderived cells.
We previously established that GL261-conditioned
media (GCM) alters microglial activity in vitro [29]. We
examined whether Nrp1 deficiency affects the capacity
of GCM to modify the microglial activation state. Wt

Since inhibition of Nrp1-dependent pathways has
been reported to affect the growth of glioma-derived
tumor cell lines [7, 20], we investigated the capacity
of increasing amounts of EG00229 to suppress growth
and migratory behavior of the GL261-eGFP cell line
in vitro. Significant effects on cell survival (as assayed
using propidium iodide (PI) staining) and migration
were first seen at 12.5μM (Supplementary Figure 5). As
we estimated steady state concentrations of EG00229
administered to mice to be approximately 1μM, we do not
expect that this was a significant factor affecting tumor
growth in those mice. However, its contribution to the
disease course cannot be ruled out based on our data.

or Nrp1MgKO microglia, pre-treated with EG00229 or
DMSO vehicle, were cultured in the presence of GCM
for 12 hours, and CD86 expression was evaluated by
immunofluorescence. Wt microglia pre-treated with
EG00229 showed a significant increase in the M1 marker,
CD86, after GCM exposure, relative to those that were
not exposed to GCM, whereas GCM-exposed wt microglia
that were not pre-treated with EG00229 failed to show a
significant increase in CD86 expression (Figure 6C, 6D).
Consistent with this finding, CD86 expression increased
with GCM treatment of Nrp1MgKO microglia whether or
not they were pre-treated with EG00229 (Figure 6C, 6D).

demonstrated that microglia show increased activation of
the M2-associated SMAD2/3 pathway in the presence of
the Nrp1 agonist, tuftsin [25], we investigated whether the
activity of this pathway differed between wt and Nrp1MgKO
microglia in the presence of GCM. We assessed basal
activation of SMAD2/3 in wt and Nrp1MgKO microglia:
no appreciable difference in SMAD2/3 expression or its
activation was evident between the two cell populations
(Supplementary Figure 4). Wt microglia were incubated
with or without EG00229 and stimulated with GCM for
30 minutes. Nrp1MgKO microglia were also stimulated with
GCM for 30 minutes and SMAD2/3 activation assessed
by immunoblotting for the ratio of phosphorylated
SMAD2/3 to total SMAD2/3. Wt microglia treated
with GCM showed significantly increased SMAD2/3
activation relative to the wt control, whereas the Nrp1MgKO
microglia did not (Figure 7A, 7B). Similarly, wt microglia
pre-treated with EG00229 did not show activation of
SMAD2/3 after treatment with GCM (Figure 7C, 7D).

Nrp1 depletion or pharmacologic inhibition in
microglia impairs the activation of the SMAD2/3
pathway
To address why Nrp1-deficient and EG00229-treated
wt microglia showed differences in M1 polarization in the
presence of glioma-derived mediators, we investigated
whether they exhibited deficits in signaling via Nrp1dependent pathways related to polarization. Since
Nrp1 is a co-receptor for TGFβ, and having previously

microenvironment, promoting their polarization to a protumorigenic phenotype and thereby facilitating tumor
growth and neovascularization. We present evidence
that ablation of Nrp1 in GAMs or focal treatment with
EG00229, an inhibitor of Nrp1’s b1 domain, modulates
the way GAMs interact with glioma-derived tumor cells
and tumor-cell generated cytokines, resulting in alterations
in their polarization which correlate with slower disease
progression.
Nrp1 is also expressed by other cell types, raising
the question of whether the ability of EG00229 to suppress
tumor growth is also due to its effects on endothelial
cells [26] and/or the glioma tumor cells. The EG00229
concentrations used in vivo were not high enough to be
cytotoxic to tumor cells, but other effects on cells within
the tumor microenvironment cannot be ruled out in
contributing to a slower disease course.
The related receptor Nrp2 is also expressed on
microglia. As we presented here, ITC binding using
recombinant Nrp1b1 and Nrp2b1 domains demonstrated
that EG00229 was fully selective for Nrp1b1, suggesting
that it is only necessary to inhibit Nrp1 to achieve antitumoral immunity, again decreasing the potential for
toxicity at the doses required for therapeutic effect. New
and more potent EG00229 analogues are being explored
that will improve its utilization in the clinical setting.
Our results demonstrate that Nrp1 ablation from
GAMs or pharmacologic inhibition of Nrp1 signaling
causes anti-tumorigenic GAMs to infiltrate and
accumulate at the actively expanding glioma border. This
is correlated with a reduction in overall tumor vascularity
and growth. While it is possible that some macrophages
did not undergo cre-recombinase induced excision of the
Nrp1 gene, a large population of Nrp1-depleted-, CSF1Rexpressing cells was apparent in tumors of Nrp1MgKO mice
(Figure 2). Our finding that macrophage density within
tumors increases when Nrp1 is knocked out is similar
to the report of Casazza and colleagues who observed
increased infiltration of squamous cell carcinoma tumors
by macrophages in mice with Nrp1 depletion of Ly6C
expressing myeloid cells [8].
GAMs near the invasive edge of gliomas in humans
and mice upregulate expression of TGF-β, which in turn
increases glioma invasiveness [38]. Nrp1 functions as
co-receptor for TGFβ that amplifies SMAD2/3 signaling
in GAMs, which promotes M2 polarization of microglia
[19, 25]. We show here that Nrp1MgKO microglia fail to
activate SMAD2/3 signaling in response to glioma tumor
cell-conditioned media that contains TGFβ in addition
to other cytokines, and that this altered combination of
signaling pathways underlies their increased M1, antitumoral polarization. It should be noted that other Nrp1mediated pathways, particularly VEGFA, semaphorin 3A,
and HGF signaling may also play important roles in the
overall modalities of how GAMs associate with the tumor
microenvironment. Furthermore, it would be worthwhile
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to analyze transcriptional differences between wild type
and Nrp1MgKO GAMs isolated from tumors to assess
significant alterations in gene expression in an unbiased
manner.
GL261 tumors have been shown to recapitulate
many characteristics of GBM [39]. Evaluation of tumors
reveals histologic pleomorphism, pseudopalisades around
necrotic areas, and tumoral neoangiogenesis. GL261
tumors are invasive, but not metastatic. Moreover they
present moderate immunogenicity. Validation of our
results with additional astrocytoma cell lines of both
murine and human origin would be important, although
to study this pathway with human-derived glioma cell
lines, immunocompromised animals are required, which
presents a significant drawback in the study of antitumoral immunity. Additionally, it would be critical
to analyze more glioma biopsies to firmly establish a
correlation of Nrp1 expression in macrophages with the
severity of the disease course.
Our results are the first to our knowledge to
demonstrate that in vivo pharmacological inhibition
of Nrp1, not just its genetic ablation, results in better
outcomes in the glioma disease course. Taken together,
these findings support the investigation of Nrp1-selective
inhibitors as potential therapeutics for gliomas.

Materials and Methods
Evaluation of human tumors
Four patients with primary glioma who had
undergone surgical resection from 2000 to 2013 at the
Stony Brook University Medical Center (Stony Brook,
NY) were selected based on the availability of sufficient
remnant tissue to support the aims of this study. Patient
clinical information was provided by the Cancer Registry
of Stony Brook University Medical Center, including data
about patient age, sex, treatment, tumor recurrence, and
survival. Use of archival surgical pathology specimens for
immunohistochemical studies (Committees on Research
Involving Human Subjects protocol 94651) was approved
by the Institution Review Board of Stony Brook University
Medical Center. Representative tissue blocks from each
case were assembled from the archival collections from
Department of Pathology and were graded according to
World Health Organization standards, as pilocytic (grade
I), grade II, grade III, and grade IV tumors.
Five-micrometer,
formalin-fixed,
paraffinembedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylenes
and rehydrated in graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was
performed in citrate buffer (20 mmol/L, pH 6.0) at 100°C
for 20 min. The slides were allowed to dry, after which
they were subjected to three PBS washes. Non-specific
protein interactions were blocked by pretreatment with

5% goat serum in 0.1% Tween-20-supplement PBS for 1
hour and immunolocalization was performed using antihuman Nrp1 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Technologies) and Iba1
(1:1000) (Wako) primary antibodies. The slides were
next washed thrice with PBS, stained with alexa-fluor
conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room
temperature, washed with PBS, and cover-slipped with
DAPI fluoromount. Co-localization of Nrp1 and iba1 was
assessed by confocal microscopy.

trypsinized, homogenized, and plated in DMEM (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1x
P/S. Media was replaced on the 3rd day. After 10-15 days,
the cultures were treated with lidocaine (Sigma), gently
rocked, and microglia were isolated from the supernatant,
counted, and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with
1%FBS and 1x P/S. For live imaging of microglia, 20μg/
mL Mini-Ruby (Invitrogen) was added to media for 24
hours, after which the media was removed, the culture
was rinsed in 1x HBSS, and media was replaced [33]. All
microglia were used for experiments within 48 hours of
plating.

Glioma-derived cell line
The GL261 cell line (available through the Division
of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis Tumor Repository
at the National Cancer Institute) is derived from a
chemically-induced C57BL/6 murine astroglioma [28].
We previously stably transfected the cells with an eGFP
construct, generating the cell line, GL261-eGFP, which
has been characterized in culture and in an in vivo glioma
model [29]. This cell line was expanded in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1x
Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S).

Evaluation of EG00229 cytotoxicity
For evaluation of EG00229-induced cell death,
10,000 GL261-eGFP cells were plated per well in a 96well plate and incubated in different concentrations of
EG00229 for 24 hours. GL261-eGFP cells were then
washed in HBSS, incubated with 1µg/mL propidium
iodide for 10 minutes, washed, and fixed in 4%w/v PFA.
63x images were taken in six random fields of view and
PI+-stained cells were counted to determine drug-induced
cell death.

Animals

Transwell migration assays

Mice were bred under maximum isolation
conditions on a 12:12 hour light: dark cycle with food
ad libitum. Littermates from Nrp1fl/fl x Nrp1fl/fl Csf1R-cre
breeding pairs were used for experiments [30, 31]. Mice
expressing cre recombinase (Nrp1MgKO) effectively lack
Nrp1 in microglia and macrophages. Littermates lacking
cre recombinase are considered ‘wild-type’. All mice were
bred on the C57BL/6 background.

GL261-eGFP cells were serum starved for 24 hours
then harvested, counted, washed, and resuspended in
serum-free DMEM. 10,000 GL261-eGFP cells were plated
to 8.0µm transwell inserts (Corning) suspended over
DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS containing different
concentrations of the Nrp1 inhibitor EG00229. Transwell
cultures were allowed to grow for 24 hours after which
non-migratory cells were gently scraped from the top of
the transwell membranes using cotton Q-tips. Membranes
were then fixed in 4%PFA, washed in 1x PBS, stained
with DAPI, and cell migration across the membranes
evaluated by counting the number of nuclei within five
random 20x fields for each transwell insert.

Genotyping
Tissue was acquired from mice by tail snip. Crude
DNA was extracted by boiling the tissue in 50mM NaOH
for 10 minutes followed by pH neutralization via the
addition of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Presence of Csf1Rcre and/or the floxed Nrp1 alleles was confirmed using
Crimson Taq PCR (New England Biotechnologies) with
primers designed against their appropriate gene sequences
(See Supplementary Table 1). All mice were genotyped
prior to use.

RNA extraction
RNA was harvested from cells by first removing
their media, washing them with PBS, and lysing them
with RNA-Bee (Tel-Test) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. To obtain cDNA, one microgram of RNA was
reverse transcribed on a Veriti Thermocycler (Applied
Biosystems) using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription kit. Amplification of cDNA products was
performed using primers against RNA products of interest
using a Veriti Thermocycler (see Supplementary Table 1).

Primary microglia
Primary microglia were harvested as previously
described [32]. Briefly, 0-3 day old (d0-3) mice were
decapitated and their cerebral cortices were dissected in
ice-cold 1x Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (1x HBSS,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The cortices were

Imaging

Gliomas were established in 3-4 month old mice as
previously described [29]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized
using atropine (0.6 mg/kg, i.p.) and 2.5% avertin (0.02
mg/g, i.p.). A midline incision was made on the scalp and
a small burr hole was drilled in the skull at stereotactic
coordinates of bregma, −1 mm anteroposterior and +2
mm mediolateral. 3 x 104 GL261-eGFP cells suspended
in 1μL of PBS were injected in anesthetized mice over
two minutes at a depth of 3mm. Local delivery of
drugs to the gliomas was achieved using mini-osmotic
pumps (Alzet) connected via rubber tubing to 3mm
cannulas (PlasticsOne) positioned directly over the
injection tracks. Pumps were either filled with saline
+ 0.75%DMSO vehicle or 75μM EG00229 (in 0.75%
DMSO) and subcutaneously implanted into the backs
of mice, as previously described [29]. After completion
of the procedure, the incision was sutured and the mice
were placed on a heated surface until fully recovered
from anesthesia. Buprenorphine was administered to mice
for pain management if signs of distress were observed.
If mice were found to have lost more than 30% of their
initial body weight over the disease course, they were
euthanized. All animal procedures were approved by the
Stony Brook University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC).

Image acquisition was performed on either a Nikon
Eclipse E600 Microscope (Nikon) or a Zeiss LSM 510
confocal microscope (Zeiss).

Immunohistochemistry
For evaluation of tumor tissue at different time
points, mice were deeply anesthetized with 2.5% avertin
and transcardially perfused with 50 mL PBS followed by
50 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brain tissue
was removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 12 hours
followed by 30%w/v sucrose in PBS at 4°C until fully
dehydrated. The brains were then embedded in optimal
cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek), and sectioned
using a Leica cryostat (Nussloch, Germany). 20-μm thick
coronal sections of throughout all tumor containing tissue
were taken for analysis.
For evaluation of tumor volumes, serial sections
were evaluated through the largest portions of tumor and
tumor diameters were measured and averaged to calculate
an average tumor radius using NIS-Elements software
(Nikon Instruments Inc.) As GL261-based tumors grow
spherically, volume was calculated using the equation V
= 4/3πr3.
For evaluation of tumor vascularity, serial sections
were stained with anti-CD-31 (1:500) (Millipore).
Photomicrographs, including 10 random 40x images
within tumors were captured and tumor vascularity for
each specimen calculated by summating the total luminal
area bounded by CD31+ staining for blood vessels using
NIS-elements software (Nikon Instruments Inc.).
For evaluation of intra-tumoral inflammation,
sections were stained for either F4/80 (1:500) (Abcam) or
iba1 (1:1000) (Wako) to evaluate GAM populations. Areas
surrounding the needle tract from the tumor cell injection
were excluded from imaging analysis. Random, 63x fields
of view within the center of tumors or within the border of
tumors were used to evaluate GAM density. Co-staining
with iba1 or F4/80 and CD86 (1:50) (Millipore), 1:50
CD206 (R&D Systems Inc.), and 1:500 TSPO (Abcam)
was used to evaluate GAM polarization. Additionally,
sections were stained with 1:100 Csf1R (VWR) and
1:100 Nrp1 (R&D Biosystems) antibodies. random, 63x
images were taken for each section and Image J (NIH)
used to calculate Mander’s co-localization coefficient
between iba1 or F4/80 and each inflammation marker.
Ratios of average CD86 to CD206 co-localization were
calculated for each specimen to determine the M1/M2
GAM polarization ratio.

Isothermal titration calorimetry
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments
were carried out in a reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH
7.9, 50 mM NaCl) using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter
(MicroCal, LLC) with a reaction cell volume of 1.4 mL at
15 °C. Recombinant Nrp1b1 and Nrp2b1 were prepared
as previously described [26]. Prior to the experiments,
Nrp1b1 and Nrp2b1 samples were each dialyzed in the
same buffer and all solutions, including the buffer that was
used for heat dilution measurements, and were degassed
and filtered just before loading into the calorimeter.
5 μM Nrp2b1 or 5 µM Nrp1b1 in the reaction cell was
titrated with the 50 μM stock solutions of EG00229. 19
consecutive compound injections of 15 μL at 2 second/
μL were applied at 4 minutes intervals, while stirring the
reaction solution at 300 rpm constant speed. For heat
dilution of the protein, 1.4 mL of reaction buffer in the
reaction cell was titrated by 300 μL of 50 µM compound
and this value was subtracted from the measured heats
of binding. Protein concentrations of the samples used
in these experiments were estimated by UV absorbance
measurements at 280nm.

with 95% confidence. Differences in survival between
populations were analyzed by the Mantel-Cox log rank
test. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad
Prism (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Cells or tissue were lysed on ice in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na
deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, and 1x protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Debris was spun
out of samples at 14,000rpm and tissue supernatant was
resuspended and denatured by boiling and treatment with
β-mercaptoethanol, run using SDS-PAGE, and transferred
to PVDF membranes (Immobilon; Millipore). Membranes
were then washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%
tween-20 (pH 7.40, TBS-T), blocked in 5% BSA or 5%
skim milk powder for 1 hour and probed using p-Smad2/3
(Cell Signaling, 1:1000), Smad2/3 (Cell Signaling,
1:1000), F4/80 (Abcam, 1:500), Csf1R (VWR, 1:200),
Iba1 (WAKO, 1:1000), α-actin (Santa Cruz, 1:5000) or
TSPO (Abcam, 1:500) overnight. Membranes were then
rinsed in TBS-T, probed with appropriate HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies, rinsed in TBS-T, and exposed to
Pierce ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) for
1 minute after which X-ray films (Denville Scientific
Inc.) were developed from the membranes. Densitometry
analysis was performed using Image J (NIH). Antibodies
were stripped from membranes in 0.1% SDS, 1%
Tween-20, 1.5% glycine, pH 2.2 stripping buffer (Abcam)
via two 10-minute incubations at room temperature.
