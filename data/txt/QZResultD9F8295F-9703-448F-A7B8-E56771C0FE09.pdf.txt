BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) significantly improve survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic
phase (CML-CP). Conditional probability provides survival information in patients who have already survived for a specific period of
time after treatment. METHODS: Cumulative response and survival data from 6 consecutive frontline TKI clinical trials were analyzed.
Conditional probability was calculated for failure-free survival (FFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), event-free survival (EFS), and
overall survival (OS) according to depth of response within 1 year of the initiation of TKIs, including complete cytogenetic response,
major molecular response, and molecular response with a 4-log or 4.5-log reduction. RESULTS: A total of 483 patients with a median
follow-up of 99.4 months from the initiation of treatment with TKIs were analyzed. Conditional probabilities of FFS, TFS, EFS, and OS
for 1 additional year for patients alive after 12 months of therapy ranged from 92.0% to 99.1%, 98.5% to 100%, 96.2% to 99.6%, and
96.8% to 99.7%, respectively. Conditional FFS for 1 additional year did not improve with a deeper response each year. Conditional
probabilities of TFS, EFS, and OS for 1 additional year were maintained at >95% during the period. CONCLUSIONS: In the era of TKIs,
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase who survived for a certain number of years maintained excellent clinical outC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improve survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CMLCP),1-7 such that their survival is nearly identical to that of the general population.7 A common clinical scenario is for a
patient who has survived for a certain period of time with a given response to TKIs to try to understand their prognosis
with continued therapy. The literature has documented the long-term probability of survival endpoints from the initiation
of therapy. However, once a patient has initiated therapy and achieved a given response, their survival is modulated by the
time they have already been receiving therapy and the response they have achieved. To the best of our knowledge, these
long-term survival endpoint probabilities after specific time periods and how they are modulated by the response status at
that time seldom has been addressed in the literature.8,9 Conditional survival probability represents the probability of
being alive as a function of the time already lived. The effect of the response achieved can be incorporated into the evaluation of these probabilities, providing relevant information regarding the expectations based on the outcome already
achieved.10 The objective of the current study was to analyze the conditional survival probabilities of failure-free survival
(FFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with CML-CP
receiving frontline therapy with TKIs and as a function of the depth of response at different time points.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP who enrolled in 6
consecutive or parallel prospective clinical trials of imatinib
(at a starting dose of 400 mg or 800 mg daily, with or without pegylated interferon), nilotinib (at a dose of 400 mg
twice daily), or dasatinib (at a dose of 50 mg twice daily or
100 mg daily) at a single institution were analyzed.4-6,11,12
These trials were registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov (identifiers NCT00038649, NCT00048672, NCT00333840,
NCT00050531, NCT00254423, and NCT00129740).
All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review
Board and informed consent was obtained in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. The inclusion criteria
were similar for all trials including age 15 years,
adequate organ function, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2. The following
response categories were analyzed using standard definitions13: complete cytogenetic response (CCyR); major
molecular response (MMR); and molecular response with
a 4-log and 4.5-log (international scale) reduction (MR4
and MR4.5, respectively).
OS was considered to be the period from the initiation of therapy until death from any cause at any time.
EFS was calculated from the initiation of therapy to loss
of complete hematologic response, loss of major cytogenetic response, transformation to accelerated phase or
blast phase, or death from any cause during study therapy.
TFS was calculated from the initiation of therapy to transformation to accelerated phase or blast phase or death

during study therapy. FFS was calculated from the initiation of therapy with TKIs to an event (as defined above),
discontinuation of therapy for any reason, or death.
Patients who were alive at the end of the study period
were censored at the date of last follow-up. Survival status
of patients who were lost to follow-up was monitored by
telephone, letter, or the Social Security Death Index.
Statistical Analysis

The probability of survival by response was estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method.14 Conditional survival
was calculated as the probability of surviving an additional
“y” years, given that the patients has already survived “x”
years.15 Landmark analysis was performed to calculate
conditional survival for each additional year. P values
were 2-tailed and P values < .05 were considered to be
statistically significant. The Cox proportional hazards
model with a time-dependent variable was performed for
univariate and multivariate analysis.16 Variables with a P
value < .10 were included in a multivariate analysis. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical
software (version 22.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Patients

From May 2000 to January 2012, a total of 483 patients
with CML-CP were enrolled in the clinical trials analyzed

day, 43 patients treated with imatinib at a dose of

800 mg/day, 158 patients treated with imatinib at a dose
of 800 mg/day with or without pegylated interferon, 105
patients treated with nilotinib, and 107 patients treated
with dasatinib).4,6,11,12 The median age at diagnosis was
48.3 years (range, 15.1-84.8 years) (Table 1). The overall
median follow-up was 99.4 months. The median followup was significantly longer for patients treated with imatinib (126.3 months) compared with those receiving nilotinib (47.8 months) or dasatinib (50.4 months) (P<.001).
Within 1 year of the initiation of therapy, 425 patients
(88%) achieved CCyR, 349 patients (72%) achieved
MMR, 202 patients (42%) achieved MR4, and 162
patients (34%) achieved MR4.5. The FFS, TFS, EFS, and
OS by response within 1 year are shown in Figure 1. Overall, 16 patients (3%) were lost to follow-up (13 patients
treated with imatinib, 2 patients treated with dasatinib,
240

and 1 patient treated with nilotinib). Fifty-three patients
(11%) in the current study died (12 [23%] died of
progressive disease, 5 [9%) died of complications of stem
cell transplantation, 9 [17%] died of a secondary malignancy, 9 [17%] died of cardiovascular events, 2 [4%] died
of sepsis, 2 [4%] died with dementia, 2 [4%] died of surgical complications, 2 [4%] died in car accidents, 1 [2%]
died of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 [2%] died of hepatitis
C cirrhosis, 1 [2%] died of Parkinson disease, 1 [2%] died
by suicide, 1 [2%] died of bowel obstruction, and 5 [9%]
died of unknown causes).
Conditional Survival

Conditional probability of FFS for 1 additional year for
all patients (ie, regardless of response beyond CCyR)
ranged from 92% to 99% (Table 2). The conditional

response. The projected probability at 24 months was
96.9% for all patients and improved to 97.9% for those in
CCyR at 12 months, 98.7% for patients in MMR at 12
months, 100% for patients in MR4 at 12 months, and
100% for patients in MR4.5 at 12 months.
Conditional OS for 1 additional year ranged from
97% to 100%, regardless of response and time on therapy
(Table 5). Overall, all conditional probabilities of FFS,
TFS, EFS, and OS for 1 additional year were constant at
>95% regardless of depth of response beyond CCyR
(Fig. 2).
Multivariate Analysis

We then performed a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis to investigate adverse prognostic factors for
clinical outcome. This analysis demonstrated best cumulative response status at any time as a prognostic factor for
FFS, TFS, EFS, and OS, and older age and the presence
of clonal evolution at the time of diagnosis as adverse factors for OS (Table 6). The lack of CCyR had the highest
hazard ratio (HR) for all survival endpoints except for OS,

in which it was equal to that for MMR (HR for CCyR,
6.250; HR for MMR, 6.579).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first report of
conditional survival of FFS, TFS, EFS, and OS with longterm follow-up in patients with newly diagnosed CMLCP who were receiving TKIs as initial therapy. The data
suggest that in patients with CML-CP, the conditional
survival probabilities of FFS, TFS, EFS, and OS for each
additional year up to 9 years are approaching 100%.
There was a small constant decrement in conditional FFS
noted regardless of response status and duration of TKI
therapy. This is expected because FFS has the most inclusive definition for what is considered failure, including
conditions that are not directly affected by the efficacy of
TKIs, including toxicity or lack of availability because of
insurance. Other long-term endpoints almost exclusively
reflect the efficacy of TKIs, which are known to be excellent.17 Only deaths occurring during therapy (for EFS or
TFS) that may be unrelated to CML would be measured
by such endpoints, but these are known to represent a

minority of events. Thus, the relatively stable EFS with
worsening FFS over the years indicates a somewhat constant rate of discontinuation of TKIs over time. Nevertheless, with a median follow-up of 99.4 months, this
cumulative incidence of TKI discontinuation apparently
did not affect OS. After failure to frontline TKIs, salvage
therapy with other TKIs are frequently effective in contributing to a stable OS. Patients without a deep response
to therapy may have an inferior EFS but the effect on OS
may not be noted for many years. It might be possible that
longer follow-up demonstrates worsening OS due to the
eventual occurrence of events with a more direct impact
on survival such as transformation to blast phase.
Conditional TFS for 1 additional year was consistent at nearly 100%. This finding suggests that patients
who can tolerate the frontline TKIs without evidence of
losing response or experiencing disease progression at 12
months or later are not likely to progress, with an incidence of disease progression 1% for each subsequent
year. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis with
a time-dependent variable demonstrated that the presence
of CCyR within 1 year had the greatest effect on TFS. Of
the 425 patients who achieved CCyR within 1 year, 11
patients (3%) progressed to advanced-phase disease (7
patients receiving imatinib [3%], 2 patients receiving
nilotinib [2%], and 2 patients receiving dasatinib [2%]).
Overall, conditional OS for 1 additional year ranged
from 97% to 100%. As expected, older age at the time of
diagnosis was associated with a shorter OS (Table 4). We
recently reported that survival in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP with access to TKIs was similar to that of
the general population.7 The decrement of survival in
older patients was associated with other medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and secondary malignancies, particularly among patients who had achieved at
least a CCyR within 1 year of therapy with TKIs. Conditional survival of the general population for 1 additional
year was 99.93% at age 20 years, 99.90% at age 30 years,
99.73% at age 40 years, 99.58% at age 50 years, 99.12%
at age 60 years, 98.05% at age 70 years, and 94.09% at
age 80 years.18
There are limitations to the current study. First, no
patients aged >85 years were enrolled. However, patients
aged > 85 years are likely to have other medical comorbidities that might obscure the true conditional clinical
outcomes related to CML-CP. Second, the follow-up of
patients treated with second-generation TKIs was significantly shorter than that of patients treated with imatinib.
Conditional survival after 5 years of treatment might significantly improve with the wide availability of nilotinib

and dasatinib. Third, longer follow-up is needed to
observe the stability of survival because there is a small but
consistent decrement in FFS each year. Finally, there
might be additional benefits of achieving deeper responses
that are not measurable by the current study, notably the
possibility of elective treatment discontinuation.
Patients with CML-CP who survived for a certain
number of years were found to maintain excellent clinical
outcomes in the era of TKIs. However, over time, patients
may discontinue therapy for a variety of reasons, which
may affect OS. It is important to note that the excellent
conditional long-term outcomes expected reflect close
continued monitoring of patients for CML and other
comorbidities and adverse events associated with the use
of TKIs such as is performed in clinical trials. It cannot be
assumed that this can be extrapolated to circumstances in
which patients are less stringently managed.
