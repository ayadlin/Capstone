ABSTRACT
Cancer has long been a grievous disease complicated by innumerable players
aggravating its cure. Many clinical studies demonstrated the prognostic relevance
of the tumor suppressor protein p53 for many human tumor types. Overexpression
of mutated p53 with reduced or abolished function is often connected to resistance
to standard medications, including cisplatin, alkylating agents (temozolomide),
anthracyclines, (doxorubicin), antimetabolites (gemcitabine), antiestrogenes
(tamoxifen) and EGFR-inhibitors (cetuximab). Such mutations in the TP53 gene
are often accompanied by changes in the conformation of the p53 protein. Small
molecules that restore the wild-type conformation of p53 and, consequently, rebuild
its proper function have been identified. These promising agents include PRIMA-1,
MIRA-1, and several derivatives of the thiosemicarbazone family. In addition to
mutations in p53 itself, p53 activity may be also be impaired due to alterations in
p53’s regulating proteins such as MDM2. MDM2 functions as primary cellular p53
inhibitor and deregulation of the MDM2/p53-balance has serious consequences.
MDM2 alterations often result in its overexpression and therefore promote inhibition
of p53 activity. To deal with this problem, a judicious approach is to employ MDM2
inhibitors. Several promising MDM2 inhibitors have been described such as nutlins,
benzodiazepinediones or spiro-oxindoles as well as novel compound classes such as
xanthone derivatives and trisubstituted aminothiophenes. Furthermore, even naturally
derived inhibitor compounds such as α-mangostin, gambogic acid and siladenoserinols
have been discovered. In this review, we discuss in detail such small molecules that
play a pertinent role in affecting the p53-MDM2 signaling axis and analyze their
potential as cancer chemotherapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
[6, 7, 12-15]. Apoptosis is initiated by trans-activating
pro-apoptotic proteins such as PUMA (p53 upregulated
modulator of apoptosis) [15, 16], FAS (cell surface death
receptor) [2, 15], or BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein) [2,
6, 7, 15-17]. In contrast, cell cycle arrest is induced by p53
via trans-activating genes such as p21 (CDK-inhibitor 1,
cyclin dependent kinase) [2, 6, 7, 15] and others [3, 15].
Interestingly, p53 itself is capable of triggering cellular
responses (survival or induced cell death) as well. This
ability may vary according to the cell type, intensity of
stress signal and/or extent of cellular damage [15]. Besides
an augmentation of the protein level, the activation of

p53 unfurled
TP53 (tumor suppressor gene p53) is one of the
most well-studied tumor suppressor genes. Because of its
pivotal role in protecting from malignancies, p53 is called
“guardian of the genome” [1-4]. Its signaling is triggered
through myriad cellular events ranging from DNA damage
to hypoxia, stress and a plethora of other causes [2, 3, 5-7].
Upon activation, p53 acts as zinc-containing transcription
factor [7-11] and regulates downstream genes that are

p53 also includes post-translational modifications in the
protein itself, which subsequently activates p53-targeted
genes [18]. One such post-translational modification
is induced by DNA damage. Similar damage leads to
activation of kinases like ATM (Ataxia telangiectasiamutated protein) [3, 4, 17, 18] and Chk2 (Checkpoint
kinase 2), which subsequently phosphorylate p53,
resulting in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
[18]. In normal cells, expression of p53 is low [7, 13] and
its half-life is about 20 min [13]. However, in the case of
cellular stress, p53’s half-life is extended to several hours,
which consequentially results in elevated p53 protein
levels in the cell [18]. As cellular gatekeeper [7, 12, 18,
19], a primary role of p53 is to recognize, whether damage
is irrevocable and accordingly induce apoptosis [18, 19].

in this site result in the loss of DNA binding.
Muller and Vousden have described four different
mechanisms of mut-p53 [23]. These mechanisms stand
testimony to the changes in the interaction between
mut-p53 and other proteins. Among these proteins,
transcription factors play a crucial role. In model 1,
mut-p53 interacts with DNA by using mut-p53 binding
elements or directly interacts with other parts of the DNA.
In model 2 and 3, mut-p53 binds to transcription factors
or other proteins and selectively enhances (e.g. NF-Y,
nuclear factor Y) or inhibits (e.g. p63) their functions.
Proteins that are not directly associated to the regulation
of gene expression (e.g. NRD1, nardilysin 1) can also be
enhanced or blocked by mut-p53 (model 4). Alteration in
DNA-binding ability is yet another important mechanism
through which mut-p53 has been observed to function
[23]. Thus the manifold contributions of p53 to disease
progression makes exploring its role in pathogenesis
indispensable.

The involvement of p53 in cancer
It is well known that p53 suppresses tumor
formation and renders protection against DNA damage by
inducing cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis [2, 6,
7, 20, 21]. However, the p53 pathway is often mutated in
cancer [12]. In fact, mutations or deletions in the TP53
gene are present in nearly 50% of human cancers, and
primarily results in impaired tumor suppressor function
[22]. Upon loss of p53 functionality, damaged cells may
proliferate transferring mutations to the next generation
[20]. It is through this mechanism that deregulation of p53
often leads to the formation of tumors [20].
Cancers harboring mut-p53 (mutant p53) are
commonly characterized by aggravated metastasis and
genomic instability [23, 24]. Several in vitro studies have
exhibited additional oncogenic functions of mut-p53 in
addition to tumor suppression. These functions include
promoting invasion, migration, angiogenesis and
proliferation [23]. To worsen the matter further, mut-p53
is also responsible for enhanced drug resistance and
mitogenic defects [23]. The above functions are just a few
of the plethora of characteristics attributed to p53. This
suggests the presence of multiple pathways, through which
p53 asserts a crucial role in cancer progression that are
impacted by mut-p53 [23].
Mutations in p53 may arise due to an anomaly in the
position of any amino acid [23]. However, multiple reports
indicate preferred sites of mutation: R175, G245, R248,
R249, R273, and R282 [23]. Mut-p53 can be broadly
classified into structural and DNA-contact mutants. While
the former causes unfolding of wild-type p53 (wt p53)
protein, the latter changes single amino acids, disabling
the binding of p53 to DNA (53). The conglomeration of
mutations indicates that the DNA-binding activity of p53
is the main critical function, which is commonly modified
in p53 mutants [23, 25]. It is interesting to note that the
majority of mutations occur in the core domain of p53,
which usually harbors sequence-specific DNA binding
activity (residues 102-292) [26]. Consequently, mutations

MDM2 antagonizes p53
Despite the significant role of mut-p53 in cancer
pathobiology, the intriguing fact remains that half of
all cancer patients carry wt p53 [27]. This indicates the
existence of other factors that favor tumor formation and
progression. One such factor is the p53-inhibitory protein
MDM2 (murine double minute 2). MDM2 is the key
physiological regulator of p53 and tightly controls p53
protein levels [12] (Figure 1). It contains a RING (really
interesting gene) domain at the C terminus functioning
as an E3 ligase along with a p53-binding domain at the
N terminus [16]. Wild-type p53 acts as transcription
factor, activating MDM2 to target p53 for degradation
[7, 9-11, 28]. p53 binds to the MDM2 promoter, thereby
increasing MDM2 expression [22]. While on the one
hand MDM2 binds to p53 and blocks its N-terminal
transactivation domain, it induces p53’s degradation via
ubiquitin-proteasome machinery on the other hand [12].
After cellular stress such as DNA damage, MDM2’s
activity decreases leading to p53 stabilization [11, 2830]. The resulting increase in p53 protein levels leads to
an upregulation of MDM2 activity, which in turn causes
degradation of p53 [10, 28, 31]. Thus, the cellular levels
of p53 and its inhibitor MDM2 are in turn, mutually
controlled by negative feedback loop [9-11, 28, 30],
wherein MDM2 downregulates p53 and p53 upregulates
MDM2. As a result of this regulatory circuit, the nuclear
concentrations of both p53 and MDM2 are normally kept
at low levels [12]. Therefore, a deregulated MDM2/p53
balance, (e.g. by overexpression of MDM2) may have
devastating consequences [22].
Such imbalance is often associated with malignant
changes in normal cells. Increased MDM2 levels lead to
tumorigenesis and correlate with poor clinical prognosis
[22]. The overall frequency of MDM2 gene amplification
8922

in human tumors is around 7%. In a study comprising
approximately 4000 biopsies obtained from clinical or
xenograft tumors across 28 tumor types, the frequency
of MDM2 amplifications varied over a wide range in
different types of cancer. The highest frequency of MDM2
amplification was observed in soft tissue tumors (20%),
and osteosarcomas followed second with an incidence of
16% [32]. Several mechanisms have been suggested for
MDM2 overexpression. In addition to gene amplification,
a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in
the MDM2 gene promoter (SNP309) leads to enhanced
transcription and increased translation [22, 33]. Therefore,
the interaction between MDM2 and p53 suggests an
appealing strategy for treatment of cancer and represents
a promising therapeutic target [16].

Mutations in the p53 gene are modifications in the
proapoptotic balance causing drug resistance (Table 2).
Alterations in p53 frequently occur in tumors and result
in loss of p53 function [35]. The correlation between p53
mutation status and sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs has been
confirmed by a large study conducted by the National
Cancer Institute, USA, where 60 cell lines and more than
100 anticancer drugs were examined [36]. However, the
way in which p53 influences drug resistance depends on
several different parameters including the mode of action
of the drug, genetic alterations during carcinogenesis,
and the type of cancer [35]. A comprehensive overview
of mechanisms of resistance development against
all cytotoxic drugs is beyond the scope of a single
review article. We therefore have selected several
chemotherapeutic agents and described their mechanisms
of drug resistance in Table 2.

AGENTS RESTORING P53 WILD-TYPE
CONFORMATION

The relationship between a target and a drug does
not stand alone. Any drug-target interaction is plagued
with many other factors that pose threats to the holistic
therapeutic strategy. One such factor is drug resistance.
Resistance towards cytotoxic drugs still presents an
enormous problem in the treatment of cancer [34].
Some mechanisms of drug resistance have been recently
classified by Marin et al. The authors distinguished
between different classes of mechanisms: those involving
drug uptake or export, mechanisms concerning metabolic
prodrug activation or drug inactivation, changes in
molecular targets, as well as mechanisms regarding DNA
repair or modifications in the pro- and antiapoptotic
balance [151]. Table 1 gives an overview of mechanisms
of drug resistance.

Missense mutations in TP53 often result in the
accumulation of mutant and misfolded proteins in the
nucleus [66]. Re-folding of this mutated and accumulated
p53 leads to restoration and activation of defective
proteins, resulting in high levels of active p53, which
then induces apoptosis [67]. Therefore, small molecules
capable of restoring p53 function, pose an attractive new
class of anticancer drugs (Figure 2).
In the past years, several mut-p53-reactivating
compounds have been described. An overview is given in
Table 3.

Figure 1: Autoregulatory feedback loop between p53 and its negative regulator, MDM2. After activation due to stress
signals, p53 upregulates MDM2 gene expression and increases MDM2 protein levels. As negative regulator, MDM2 protein then binds to
p53 and induces its degradation [22].

Transporters of the superfamily of solute carriers (SLCs) play an important role
in the uptake of cytotoxic drugs. If changes occur in the expression of these

Wt-p53 includes one zinc ion as an important
cofactor, which is coordinated to the side chains of three
cysteine residues and one histidine residue in the DNAbinding domain. The metal ion stabilizes the second and
third loop within the DNA-binding domain and is essential
for its correct function. In p53 mutants on the other hand,
zinc is recurrently missing [72]. Mutations in any of the
zinc-coordinating residues result in the inability of p53
to bind to zinc. Although the R175 mutant is not directly
involved in zinc binding, a histidine residue at this location
is capable of inducing structural distortions in the protein,
thereby preventing binding of zinc [70].
Generally, metal ion chelation changes p53
conformation [73, 74]. Therefore, NSC319726 treatment
induces a wild-type-like conformational change in the
p53-mutant protein, because of its metal-ion chelating
properties. The R175 mutant p53 fails to bind zinc, but
upon treatment with NSC319726 and zinc chloride at low
concentrations, zinc binding was detected [70]. Therefore,
NSC319726 may serve as source of zinc to allow the
p53R175 mutant to refold to its wild-type conformation [70].

A novel class of compounds that act as re-activators
of mut-p53 has been investigated by Yu and co-workers
[8]. Using the compound library of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), USA; they identified three compounds
(NSC319725, NSC319726, NSC328784) showing
promising inhibitory effects in mut-p53 cell lines
[8]. Comparing cell lines with mut-p53 and wt-p53,
significantly lower IC50 values have been found in cells
with the mutated status. NSC319726 exhibited particularly
low IC50 values in cells with a p53 mutation in the 175
allele. Furthermore, the compound was remarkably nontoxic to human fibroblasts (with wt-p53). The authors
observed a two-fold higher induction of apoptosis in
the p53R175 mutant than in other mutant cell lines. Upon
silencing the expression of mutant p53R175 protein, the
sensitivity to these compounds was strongly reduced. This
led to the conclusion that the activity of NSC319726 was
dependent on p53R175 mutant protein [8].

PRIMA-1 and PRIMA-1Met

NSC319726 may be a promising compound for
three reasons: firstly, because p53R175 mutant reactivation
has been observed in vivo at doses that are non-toxic to
human tissues harboring wt-p53. Secondly, the compound
exhibited a wide therapeutic window. Thirdly, the target,
mut-p53 protein, is frequently found in tumor cells.
According to the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) TP53 database, the 175 mutant is the third
most commonly found missense mutation in TP53 [70,
75].

Another compound that represents a breakthrough in
the reactivation of p53 is p53-Reactivation and Induction
of Massive Apoptosis-1 (PRIMA-1), which was identified
by Wiman and colleagues [79]. This quinuclidine
compound rescued the DNA-binding activity in vitro in
numerous mut-p53 protein species [66]. Its methylated
analogue PRIMA-1Met (also known as APR246) showed
even greater potential [67].
Treatment with quinuclidines upregulated p53 target
genes such as BAX, PUMA and NOXA [79]. Furthermore,
PRIMA-1 and APR-246 induced activation of caspases -2,
-3 and -9 [8]. Under physiological conditions, PRIMA-1
and APR-246 are rapidly converted into a reactive
intermediate compound, MQ (methylene quinuclidinone).
MQ acts as Michael acceptor and covalently binds to the
core domain of p53 [80]. Conversion of PRIMA-1 and
APR-246 to MQ renders them biologically active. As
expected, derivatives that cannot be transformed into
this reactive form are biologically inactive. Therefore,
PRIMA-1 and APR-246 can be considered as prodrugs,
which need to be activated in vivo [79]. However, due to
its limited stability at physiological conditions, MQ itself
cannot be used as a mut-p53-targeting compound and thus
necessitates further improvement [80].
Due to incorrect folding, mut-p53 proteins may
expose cysteine residues, which are hidden in the core
domain of wt-p53 [79]. This can lead to the formation
of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds, locking
mut-p53 in an inactive conformation and causing protein
aggregation. Thiol modification by reactive compounds
such as MQ prevented the formation of such disulfide
bonds and thus promoted correct folding and restoration
of the wild-type function [8].
However, it is not clear which of the 10 cysteine
residues in the p53 core domain are modified by MQ.
Cys182, Cys229, Cys242 and Cys277 are all exposed
on the surface of the core domain, and are potential
targets for modifications [64, 81]. According to Lambert

PhiKan083
Rauf et al. presented another small molecule
mut-p53 reactivator, PhiKan083 [72]. It is a carbazolederivative, which binds at the Y220C mutation site on p53
and slows down its thermal denaturation rate [71]. Y220C
is one of the most frequent mutations in cancer [76, 77]
and is located outside the DNA-binding surface of p53. In
this mutation, the replacement of a tyrosine by a cysteine
leads to decreased thermodynamic stability [72]. Although
the mutation does not change the overall structure of
the protein [78], several electrostatic interactions are
lost. More precisely, the S7/S8 loop of the protein is
destabilized, because Tyr220 cannot build electrostatic
interactions with the residues Val147, Pro151, Pro153 and
Pro223. This leads to the displacement of the loop from its
original position [72].
A drugable cavity is created on the surface at the
mutation site, which is far from the functional region of
p53. PhiKan083 occupies this cavity and is involved in
electrostatic interactions with Pro155, Glu221 and Thr230
as well as hydrogen bonds with Leu145 and Asp228.
These interactions stabilize the S7/S8 loop and prevent its
displacement. As a result of loop stabilization, PhiKan083
raises the melting temperature of Y220C mutant p53 and
consequently decreases thermal denaturation [79].

mutations. By binding misfolded and inactivated p53, reactivating compounds can restore its active form and tumor suppressor function

et al. mut-p53 is more amenable to this type of covalent
modification than the wild-type version [80]. Interestingly,
unfolded wt-p53 proteins are also modified by MQ. The
degree of binding is correlated to the extent of unfolding
[80].
In addition, a further benefit of PRIMA-1 is
represented by its large therapeutic window [79]. Although
normal cells seem to be more resistant at therapeutic
doses, PRIMA-1 and APR-246 may target other proteins
in addition to p53 [8]. How does MQ then achieve target
specificity? One plausible explanation is that the structural
aspect of a specific cysteine might dictate selectivity
and cater to the modification of only a limited number
of proteins. Furthermore, the active product, MQ, is
generated from a prodrug, only after cellular uptake [8].
This may prevent extensive modification of extracellular
proteins.
Several explanations have been suggested, as to
how alkylation of thiol groups in mut-p53 could restore
native conformation and function: (i) prevention of
disulfide bond formation within the core domain of p53,
(ii) alkylation-mediated escalation in the protein fraction
capable of binding to DNA, (iii) formation of adducts in
the core domain that may allow effective DNA-binding
and consequent transactivation of p53 target genes, and
(iv) PRIMA-1 adducts that create additional hydrophobic
interactions with amino acids in the core via hydrogen
bonding, thereby promoting accurate folding of the core
[80].
Li et al. proposed new insights into PRIMA-1Met
functionality [82]. PRIMA-1Met is the methylated analogue
of PRIMA-1, in which one of the two hydroxyl-groups is
replaced by a methoxy-group [82]. PRIMA-1Met limited
the growth of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells irrespective
of p53 status, although robust apoptosis was induced only
in mut-p53 cells [82]. Upregulation of the pro-apoptotic
protein NOXA was essential for PRIMA-1Met-mediated
activity. It led to apoptosis associated with cleavage of
PARP [Poly (ADP-ribose)-Polymerase, involved in DNA
repair and programmed cell death] [82]. Contradictory
to several previous studies, Li et al. reported that CRC
cell lines with wt-p53 or p53-null cells also responded
to PRIMA-1Met treatment [82]. Bykov and Wiman have
put forward one credible mechanism accounting, at least
in part, for the effects of the drug in p53-null cancer
cells [69]. APR-246, on conversion into MQ, modifies
TrxR1 (thioredoxin reductase 1) into an oxidase. The
latter induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
in turn contribute to APR-246-induced cell death [69].
However, in CRC cells with wt-p53 or p53-null cells,
PRIMA-1Met mainly induces cytostasis, whereas the
induction of apoptosis appears specifically in mut-p53
cells [82]. This study by Li et al. opens up avenues to
attain greater efficacy in the use of PRIMA-1Met against
cancer. However, a deeper understanding of the molecular
mechanism is still required [82].

Another mut-p53 function-restoring small molecule
is MIRA-1 (mut-p53-dependent induction of rapid
apoptosis) [67]. Although structurally MIRA analogues
are distinct from PRIMA-1, the molecular mechanism
involving reactivation of mut-p53 by MQ is quite similar
[68]. MIRA-1 contains a maleimide group with 3-4
double bonds, which forms chemical bonds with thiol and
amino groups. Thus, alkylation of cysteine and/or lysine
residues of p53 by MIRA-1 stabilizes native folding of
the protein. The alkylation status, however, depends on
the accessibility of thiol groups. As a consequence, mutant
and unfolded proteins are more effectively modified by
MIRA-1 than is the correctly folded wild-type [67, 83].
Although MIRA-1 and PRIMA-1 both act via
modification of thiol groups, they differ considerably in
kinetics of cell death induction. MIRA-1 induces cell
death much faster than PRIMA-1 does (6-12 h versus 2448 h). This could be attributed to the variable dynamics
of cellular uptake or degradation as well as differences
in their modes of action [67, 84]. MIRA-1 induces cell
killing in a mut-p53-dependent manner with a much
higher potency than PRIMA-1, and MIRA-1-induced cell
death involves DNA-fragmentation as well as caspase
activation [67].
The maleimide groups of MIRA analogues react
with thiol and amino groups of the protein through
nucleophilic addition [67]. Presence of several double
bonds within the maleimide group is critical for its activity.
MIRA-1 acts by shifting the equilibrium of p53 towards
the native conformation, which leads to restoration of
p53-mediated transactivation of target genes such as p21,
MDM2 (murine double minute 2) and PUMA as well as
induction of p53-dependent apoptosis [67].
MIRA-1 acts on multiple inter-connected pathways
to induce apoptosis. In a recent study, Saha et al. evaluated
the anti-myeloma activity of MIRA-1, both in vivo and
in vitro [85]. The authors showed that the p53 status is
not a decisive factor for induction of apoptosis by MIRA1 in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The group used
wt-, mut- and silenced p53 MM cells and observed that
MIRA-1 treatment resulted in the induction of multiple
signaling pathways implicated in apoptosis of MM cells
[85]. Firstly, MIRA-1 treatment induced ER-signaling
[85-87] by triggering activation of PERK (protein
kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), one of the
ER stress sensors. PERK as well as eIF2-α (eukaryotic
initiation factor 2) are phosphorylated and subsequently
several chaperone proteins are activated (calnexin, protein
disulfide isomerase (PDI) and binding immunoglobulin
protein (BiP)) [85]. Consistent with their findings, the
activation of pro-apoptotic PUMA and BAX as well as
the repression of anti-apoptotic proteins like Mcl-1 and
c-Myc have been shown to be linked to ER stress signaling
pathways. Thus, they concluded that contrary to previous
8928

Oncotarget

assumptions, MIRA-1 induces p53-independent apoptosis
in MM cells primarily because of a change in the balance
between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins [85].
However, further studies are required to fully
understand the modulatory mechanisms of MIRA-1associated intervention strategies in intracellular crosstalks leading to apoptosis. Simultaneously, the quest
to identify prominent signaling molecules within those
pathways becomes pertinent.

network as it would open new fields of research of novel
chemotherapeutic agents.
Sriraman et al. tested, whether the simultaneous
inhibition of both p53-antagonists, MDM2 and Wip1,
induce p53 activation more potently than single inhibitors.
Indeed, the inhibition of Wip1 fortified the effect of
MDM2 antagonists alone on p53 activation [162]. Similar
results were obtained by others [163, 164]. These findings
emphasize the therapeutic potential of negative regulators
of p53 such as MDM2, as well as other negative regulators
and opens new possibilities of a multitarget chemotherapy
in tumors harboring wt-p53.
Numerous MDM2 inhibitors have been developed
during the past few years. An overview of some potent
ones is presented in Table 4.

AGENTS INTERRUPTING THE MDM2P53-INTERACTION
Despite the fact that nuclear levels of both p53
and MDM2 are normally kept at low levels due to a
regulatory circuit, a deregulated MDM2/p53 balance,
(e.g. by overexpression of MDM2) diminishes the tumor
suppressive functions of p53 [12, 22]. Owing to this
antagonizing effect of MDM2 on p53, small molecules
have been developed that mimic p53-binding residues
[37]. High-resolution crystal structures of MDM2 and
p53 indicate that their interaction is mediated by a welldefined hydrophobic surface pocket and three hydrophobic
key residues: Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26 [88]. The compact
binding pocket in MDM2 enables scientists to design
new small molecules capable of blocking the MDM2-p53
interaction. With this interaction blocked, p53 is no longer
controlled by MDM2 and is reactivated in tumor cells
harboring wt-p53 [38].
However, MDM2 is not the only negative regulator
of p53 and therefore the other ones have to be kept in
mind. P53 is cross-linked in a complex network with
several other actors. For example, it is also regulated
by the proteins SirT1 (Sirtuin 1) [160] or Wip1 (wt-p53
induced phosphatase/PPM1D) [162].
Sirtuin 1 is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase,
which also deacetylates non-histone proteins involved in
cell growth, apoptosis, tumorigenesis and cell senescence
[160]. P53 becomes acetylated after DNA damage leading
to increased transcriptional activity. SirT1 interacts with
p53 and attenuates p53-mediated functions through
deacetylation of p53 at its C-terminal residue (Lys382).
Therefore, overexpression of SirT1 leads to the repression
of normal p53-dependent response to DNA-damage or
oxidative stress such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
[160, 161].
Furthermore, the interaction between p53 and its
other negative regulator Wip1 is controlled through an
autoregulatory feedback loop, similar to MDM2. Wip1 is
induced by genotoxic stress. It efficiently inhibited the p53
pathway by dephosphorylation of p53 at its transactivating
domain Ser15 as well as by dephosphorylation of
MDM2. Therefore, Wip1 promoted recovery from the
G2 checkpoint and contributed to the termination of
DNA damage response [162, 163, 164]. These facts
affirm the necessity to decode the entire p53 interaction

MDM2 inhibitors
Nutlins
Cis-imidazolines, also referred to as nutlins, are
promising non-peptide small molecules that are well
characterized MDM2 inhibitors [95]. They were the
first selective small molecules that inhibited the wt-p53MDM2 interaction [92, 96, 97].
Crystal structure studies demonstrated that cisimidazolines bind to the p53-binding site of MDM2 by
mimicking the interaction of critical amino acid residues
[83]. Owing to their hydrophobic nature, Trp23, Phe19
and Leu26 fit excellently into the deep hydrophobic pocket
of MDM2 [12].
P53’s binding pocket on MDM2 is sterically
inhibited by nutlin binding, thus inducing p53
accumulation and restoration of its transcriptional activity
followed by apoptosis in MDM2-overexpressing tumor
cells [98]. The compounds induce stabilization of p53,
induction of p21 target genes, cell cycle arrest as well as
apoptosis [99].
Three compounds (nutlin-1, -2 and -3) exhibited
suitable IC50 values to block the p53-MDM2 interaction
[83] (Table 4, Table 5). They possess the same core
structure and exhibit only slight variations in their
functional groups [95]. These nutlins harbored
sufficient cell permeability and elicited dose-dependent
accumulation of wt-p53. However, none of them induced
cell cycle arrest or upregulated p53 downstream gene
targets in mut- or p53-null tumor cells [92]. Hence, it is
proposed that only wt-p53 cell lines are sensitive to these
compounds. The active enantiomer of nutlin-3a, induced
apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells at much lower doses,
whereas its inactive enantiomer was ineffective even at
higher concentrations [83].
Nutlin-3 possessed activity against a broad panel of
cancer cells harboring wt-p53 in vitro and in vivo [96].
It activated p53 transcriptional activity in osteosarcoma,
retinoblastoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, colon and

breast cancer cell lines [96]. In combination with
chemoradiotherapy, the compound showed synergistic
activity against prostate [100] and lung cancers [101, 102]
as well as lymphocytic leukemia [103] and neuroblastoma
[104]. Furthermore, nutlin-3 showed normal cell protective
efficacy against the detrimental effects of chemotherapy by
inducing cell cycle arrest [105] due to inhibition of BAX
and BAK (Bcl2-antagonist/killer) [106].
However, the activity of nutlins strongly suffer
from p53 downstream aberrations, such as MDMX
overexpression [92]. Overexpressed MDMX (murine
double minute x) limits the effectiveness of nutlin-based
chemotherapy [92]. Since nutlins do not bind MDMX,
cis-imidazolines reduce MDMX protein levels in wt-p53
cancer cells by facilitating MDM2-dependent degradation
[107]. In cancer cell lines resistant to cis-imidazolines, a
combination therapy with doxorubicin may be effective
to overcome resistance. The DNA-damaging anticancer
drug doxorubicin effectively depleted MDMX levels and
therefore revealed synergistic effects in combination with
nutlins [83, 107].
Synergistic effects of nutlin-3 with cytostatic drugs
have been reported. Deben et al. investigated the benefits
combination of nutlin-3 with cisplatin in sequential
treatments (cisplatin followed by nutlin-3) [108]. They
used a series of NSCLC cell lines with differential p53
status. Although nutlin-3 showed good efficacy even as
single agent, the authors hypothesized that the anti-tumor
effect might be enhanced, if given in combination with
DNA-damaging agents [108]. Cisplatin and nutlin-3’s
sequential treatment resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic
response in wt-p53 cell lines [108]. A significant increase
in p53’s targets could be observed. Augmented protein
levels of MDM2, p21, PUMA and BAX led to cell cycle
arrest at G2/M followed by apoptosis [108]. The group
also illustrated that combinatorial therapy of small
molecules with DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin) resulted
in a synergistic cytotoxic response [108].Unravelling the
full importance of nutlin-based combination treatments
demands further evaluation.
Another study by Wang and co-workers in 2012
investigated the efficacy of nutlin-3a (Table 4) treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in osteosarcoma cell lines both in vivo and in vitro [109].
Employing three osteosarcoma cell lines [U-2 OS (wt
p53), SaOS2 (null p53), MG63 (mut-p53)], the authors
deciphered that activation of the p53 pathway due to the
disruption of p53-MDM2-interaction by nutlin-3a depends
on the presence of wt-p53 [109]. Nutlin-3a stabilized
p53 and led to dose-dependent anti-proliferative and
cytotoxic effects, inducing cell cycle arrest at G1 phase
and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro [109]. Significant
apoptosis and increased G1 phase fractions were detected,
if treated with 10 µM nutlin-3a. Further treatment with
nutlin-3a significantly upregulated p53 and p21 levels in
osteosarcoma cells [109]. In a quest to investigate, whether
nutlin-3a suppresses growth of xenograft tumors in nude
mice, Wang et al. showed that it was well tolerated at a
daily dosage of 25 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally
for 14 days. This treatment regimen resulted in 85%
inhibition of tumor growth [109].
Tonsing-Carter et al. evaluated the combination
treatment for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) [110].
Due to its aggressive nature (lacking hormone receptors)
[111, 112], the development of efficacious therapies for
TNBCs is extremely challenging. Tonsing-Carter et al.
combined a platinum-based regimen with nutlin-3a. Single
and combination treatments of nutlin-3a and carboplatin
were tested on a panel of TNBC cell lines with mut-p53
[110]. Due to the inhibition of protein-protein interactions
between MDM2 and several of its binding partners
including p53, p73α (another tumor suppressor involved
in cell cycle regulation and induction of apoptosis with
structural resemblance to p53), transcription factor E2F1
(involved in cell cycle and action of tumor suppressor
proteins) and Hif-1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1α) [113115], the use of nutlin-3a led to the activation of several
pathways associated with anti-cancer effects [110]. The
effect of nutlin-3a was especially beneficial, if it was
administered in combination with DNA-damaging drugs.
Platinum agents, such as carboplatin, form DNA-platinum
adducts leading to double-strand DNA breaks and cell
death [116]. In vitro studies showed strong synergy
between carboplatin and nutlin-3a [110]. In TNBC
cells with mut-p53 background, increased cell death

was detected, if administered in combination, as well
as decreased IC50 values for both drugs. Cleaved PARP
was detectable in 100% of tumors following combination
treatment, whereas it was only detectable in 50 - 66%
of tumors treated with carboplatin or nutlin-3a alone
[110]. Further inhibition of MDM2 by nutlin-3 increased
the pool of available p37α, which in turn activated proapoptotic gene expression and finally promoted apoptosis
[110]. Combinatorial treatment significantly inhibited
tumor growth with no serious physical complaints
such as dehydration, diarrhea or bleedings within the
gastrointestinal tract [110]. Besides primary tumor growth,
even metastatic foci in the lung decreased in size and
number relative to single-agent therapy. This was due to an
efficient delivery of nutlin-3a to the lung, as suggested by
the pharmacokinetic data [110]. Owing to these promising
results, combinatorial therapy of nutlin-3a/carboplatin
deserve further development as new clinical therapies.
Tovar et al. described a more potent inhibitor of
the p53-MDM2 interaction than the original nutlins [89].
RG7112 (Table 4) is an advanced derivative of the class
of cis-imidazolines [90]. It displaced p53 peptides from
the surface of MDM2 with a 4-fold higher potency than
nutlin-3a [96]. Furthermore, RG7112 showed improved
binding due to faster on-rate and slower off-rate, and
also exhibited improved pharmacological properties [89].
In crystal structure studies, RG7112 was found to bind
to MDM2 at the same region as the other nutlins [89].
The two chlorophenyl groups of RG7112 project into the
Leu26 and Trp23 pockets and the ethoxy group of the third
benzene ring bound into the Phe19 cave of MDM2 [90].

structural rigidity, blocking its metabolic conversion in to
an inactive imidazole [89].
In addition to these studies, Ding et al. investigated
a novel nutlin, RG7388 (RO5503781) (Table 4), which
induced p53-stabilization in a dose-dependent manner, as
well as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [90]. Although the
mode of action is similar, RG7388 achieved a significantly
higher in vivo efficacy against human osteosarcoma
xenografts tumors than RG7112. Even at lower doses,
the efficacy of RG7388 was much higher than RG7112.
At 50 mg/kg body weight, RG7112 achieved 74% tumor
growth inhibition, whereas RG7388 obtained 84% growth
inhibition at much lower doses (12.5 mg/kg) [90]. In
conclusion, RG7388 was more potent than RG7112.

Benzodiazepinediones
1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones (BDPs) are another
class of small molecule inhibitors interacting at the
p53-MDM2 site [92, 117] (Table 6). Grasberger and coworkers (2005) first reported 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5diones as inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction [118].
Compound 21 discovered by high-throughput screening of
over 338000 compounds achieved a promising IC50 value
[119]. Modifications of this scaffold led to significant
increases in potency. Due to the introduction of a 4-chloro
substitution on the phenyl rings of the scaffold, compound
23 exhibited much lower IC50 values [120]. An MDM2-23
co-crystal structure demonstrated the interaction between
BDPs and MDM2. The three phenyl rings of compound
23 bound to MDM2 by mimicking the conformation of the
p53 triad motif [121].
Although a large number of subsequently
8932

Oncotarget

synthesized compounds achieved improved efficacies,
they frequently exhibited poor pharmacokinetic properties
and poor cell permeability. However, compound 27
demonstrated promising activity in MCF7 breast cancer
cells [122]. In vivo studies with melanoma tumors showed
that compound 27 enhanced the activity of doxorubicin,
if applied in combination [123]. These compounds in
combination, led to tumor growth inhibition at doses
that are inactive, if administered alone. The combination
resulted in reduced toxicity due to lower required dosages
[83]. This points to the therapeutic benefit of small
molecules in combination therapies.
Furthermore, several other thio-benzodiazepine
compounds have been examined with respect to their
structure-activity relationship and antitumor activity [95].
Several substances achieved high binding affinities with
MDM2 and two of them, 8i and 8n, stood out particularly.
These compounds showed excellent binding activities,
which were even superior to the reference compound
nutlin-3a [95]. Molecular docking studies of the thiobenzodiazepine-MDM2 complex illustrated that the
binding interaction was mediated by three hydrophobic
pockets that are filled by the three aromatic rings of the
thiobenzodiazepines. The well positioned ester-group of
the thio-benzodiazepines, functioning as hydrogen bond
acceptor with Gly16, may account for the enhanced
binding affinity [95]. Even in vitro, most compounds
showed moderate to excellent cytotoxicity towards cancer
cells. Some compounds, including 8i and 8n, showed
even better biological activity than nutlin-3a in wt-p53
osteosarcoma cells [117]. Thus, compounds 8i and 8n
represent promising new MDM2 inhibitors that require
further evaluation.

apoptosis. The disruption of MDM2-p53 interaction by
MI-63 led to enhanced p53-levels and levels of target
genes (e.g. p21). This also correlated with G1-cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis induction [125]. Interestingly, MI63 treatment depleted MDM4 (mouse double minute 4,
also known as MDMX) protein levels [125]. MDM4, like
MDM2, is an inhibitor of p53 activity [125]. The decline
in MDM4-protein levels was proposed as consequence of
MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation [125]. Another
plausible mechanism might be reduced transcription of
MDM4 [125].
The drug-induced impediment of the MDM2-p53
interaction increased p53 levels, leading to the
upregulation of p53 target genes and wt-p53-dependent
induction of apoptosis in several human breast, colon and
prostate cancer cell lines [105]. In vivo xenograft tumor
experiments revealed a complete inhibition of tumor
growth at non-toxic doses. Administration of MI-219 (300
mg/kg) for 14 days caused complete suppression of tumor
growth, decreased the tumor volumes and showed no signs
of toxicity [92, 98].
In another study by Sosin and colleagues, differential
effects of MI-219 were tested against lymphoma cell
lines and patient-derived non-Hodgkin’s SLL (small
lymphocytic lymphoma)/CLL (chronic lymphocytic
leukemia) samples [91]. Compared to nutlin-3, MI219 triggered an earlier response after treatment
(nutlin-3: 48 h, MI-219: 12-24 h) and enhanced MDM2autoubiquitination as well as degradation at equivalent
concentrations [91]. Cell death induction by MI-219 was
more effective and occurred earlier than by nutlin-3 [91].
Also, the enhanced efficacy of MI-219 was associated
with a significant increase of p53-induced p53AIP1 (p53regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1) [91]. Reasons
for MI-219s’ enhanced efficacy over nutlin-3 include
differential binding affinities (7-fold higher) or variations
in bioavailability [91]. Another reason for the increased
efficacy of MI-219 is that MI-219 mimics four key binding
residues in p53 (Phe19, Leu22, Trp23 and Leu26) in
comparison to the three residues in the case of nutlin-3
(Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26) [91]. As a result, the former
compound was subjected to chemical optimization in
hydrogen binding and hydrophobic interactions [91].
One more compound amongst the arsenal of the MIseries, MI-43 preferentially inhibited the growth of wt-p53
cells. It induced growth arrest in G1 and G2 phases of cell
cycle at low concentrations as a result of p21-induction.
At higher doses, it induced PUMA/NOXA-evoked
apoptosis. MI-43 was less toxic towards normal lung cells
than cancer cells and sensitized cancer cells to etoposideinduced apoptosis, if used in combination [98] [105].
MI-888 is another new derivate with an excellent
pharmacokinetic profile and enhanced in vivo efficacy
[99]. It achieved a promising Ki-value and produced
rapid, complete and durable tumor regressions after oral
administration in two human xenograft tumor models

Spiro-oxindoles
Yet another group of small molecules that hold
large promise in inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction
are the spiro-oxindoles [124] (Table 4, Table 7). The
oxindole ring of these compounds mimics the side chain
of Trp23 of p53, which is critical for MDM2 binding. The
hydrophobic-substituted spiropyrrolidine-ring imitates
the side chains of Phe19 and Leu26 [90, 124]. Extensive
crystal-structure analyses have revealed that Leu22 is also
critical for binding p53 and MDM2 [124], indicating the
potential of oxindole derivates [92].
MI-63 and MI-219 are two spiro-oxindoles with
improved structures. Although MI-63 showed prominent
in vitro activity, its in vivo pharmacokinetic profile was
unsatisfactory [92]. MI-219 on the other hand, was more
effective owing to its high binding affinity for MDM2
and good oral bioavailability and better pharmacokinetic
profile [92].
In a recent study by Samudio et al., the potential
of MI-63 in acute myleoid leukemia (AML) revealed
significance [125]. In AML cell lines and tissue samples,
MI-63 elicited p53-dependent cytotoxicity as well as

SAR405838, also termed MI-77301, is another
small molecule inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction
[93]. SAR405838 is a highly optimized compound in the
spiro-oxindole family [127]. Its binding mode is similar
to that of other spiro-oxindoles. It mimics the three key
residues of p53 (Phe19, Leu26, Trp23) [93]. But unlike
the other compounds, SAR405838 captures additional
interactions. The C1 atom of its oxindole group shows

hydrophobic interactions with MDM2. The imidazole
side chain of His96 in MDM2 and the carboxyl group
of SAR405838 interact via a hydrogen bond. Even π-πstacking is present between the His96 of MDM2 and the
2-fluoro-3-chlorophenyl of SAR405838 [93]. In contrast
with the co-crystal structures of p53-MDM2 and nutlinMDM2, in SAR405838-MDM2, the N-terminus of
MDM2 forms extensive interactions with SAR405838.
This is due to re-folding of residues 10-18 of MDM2,

which interact with SAR405838 through Val14 and Thr16

achieves high binding affinities [93].
Bill et al. reported the preclinical effects of
SAR405838 in both in vitro and in vivo dedifferentiated
liposarcoma models [127]. SAR405838 restored
downstream signaling through pharmacological MDM2
inhibition. The increase of p53-induced apoptotic genes
BAX and PUMA suggests that the treatment activated the
p53 pathway [127]. Expression of apoptosis-associated
genes (e.g. p21, PUMA and BAX) was proportionate
with increasing concentrations of SAR405838 [127].
This compound further demonstrated a promising oral
pharmacokinetic profile in mice. Even if administered as
single agent, it induced apoptosis at low concentrations
[127]. SAR405838 promoted complete tumor regression
after oral administration of 200 mg/kg/wk, whereas other
potent MDM2-inhibitors (RG7112 and RG7388) did not
achieve this effect [127]. The functional outcomes of
SAR405838 strongly depend on the presence of MDM2
amplifications. Bill et al. showed that no effects were
visible in wt-p53 liposarcoma cells without overexpression
of MDM2. Therefore, SAR405838 treatment only induced
apoptosis in cancer cells harboring MDM2 amplifications
[127]. In conclusion, SAR405838 showed very promising
preclinical data. It is a potent and highly effective MDM2inhibitor and is currently undergoing clinical trial [93].

RITA bound to the N-terminus of p53 (residues
1-63) and induced a conformational change, which
propagated from the N-terminus to the core and C-terminal
domain, advocating the interruption of p53 and MDM2
[12, 94, 98]. This led to p53 accumulation and induction
of p53-dependent apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines
of different origin including carcinomas of lung, colon,
breast, skin; melanoma and diverse lymphomas [128].
Possibly, the binding of RITA to the N-terminus affected
the hydrogen bonds within the MDM2-binding site,
preventing the formation of the α-helix, which is necessary
for MDM2 binding [20]. Low concentrations of RITA
inhibited growth of carcinoma cells harboring wt p53, but
showed minimal effect on cells lacking it [92]. In contrast
to other MDM2 inhibitors, RITA activated p53 by binding
to it instead of binding to MDM2 [92]. Furthermore, RITA
suppressed the growth of human xenograft tumors in mice
without causing toxic effects in normal tissues [68]. This
led to the assumption that RITA may selectively activate
p53 in tumor cells. Although nutlin-3a and RITA target
the same protein complex, they induce different biological
outcomes. Disruption of the p53/MDM2 complex may
not be the only effect of these compounds [129]. Nutlin3a changes the repertoire of MDM2-binding partners,
whereas RITA affects p53 interactions. Burmakin et al.
found that besides MDM2-p53 interaction, RITA also
disrupted other p53 binding interactions such as with
iASPP (inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53),
Parc (p53-associated Parkin-like cytoplasmic protein)
or E6-AP (E6-associated protein) [94]. In addition, p53

activated by RITA induced the expression of Fbxw7
(F-Box and WD repeat domain containing 7), which has
a critical function in the degradation of N-Myc, a protein
that correlates with a poor prognosis and resistance to
therapy [94]. Transcription of Aurora A, an antagonist of
Fbwx7-mediated degradation of N-Myc, was repressed by
p53 [94]. In addition to its potential as wt p53 reactivating
substance, RITA also exhibited paramount efficacy as
mut-p53 activator.
The discovery of the mutant reactivating ability of
RITA was serendipitous. Initially, Zhao et al. screened for
wt-p53-activating substances [22]. RITA led to restoration
of the p53-mediated transcriptional program and induction
of p53-dependent apoptosis [68]. Remarkably, RITA
reactivated a broad range of different p53 mutant species,
including those that were mutated at three residues
[83]. Therefore, a general mechanism of action has
been suggested through which restoring the function of
different types of mutants was achieved. However, the
exact molecular mechanism has not been deciphered.
RITA-induced cell death involved DNA-fragmentation,
cytochrome C release, caspase activation, and apoptosis
[83]. Zhao et al. found RITA to be more efficacious than
PRIMA-1 in inducing cell death in a mut-p53-dependent
manner. RITA achieved much lower IC50 values than
PRIMA-1 [22]. Interestingly, the kinetics of cell death
induction considerably differed between different cell
lines. While death induction in skin cancer cells harboring
mut-p53 protein took only 6-8 h, breast cancer cells
required several days [22]. Such kinetic differences could
result from differential kinetics of cellular uptake and/or
degradation of RITA or a different set of p53 inhibitors/
activators present in these cells [22].
Weilbacher et al. demonstrated that there was no
strict link between cancer cell sensitivity to RITA and the
p53 status in tumor cells. Even in p53-null cells, RITA
was capable of inducing apoptosis [130]. Besides the fact
that RITA interacts with TrxR1 (thioreduxin reductase 1)
thus inducing ROS, it also promoted DNA damage [130].
Further, the authors proposed that JNK (c-Jun N-terminal
kinases)/SAPK (stress-activated protein kinases) and p38
MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) pathways are
important in p53-deficient cells for caspase-dependent
mitochondrial cell death [130]. JNKs translocate to
the mitochondria, where, by modulating pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family proteins,
they activate BAX and BAK to initiate apoptosis [130].
The benefits of using compounds that target wt-p53
as well as mut-p53, like RITA, have been illustrated by
Burmakin et al. They demonstrated that RITA restored
wt- and mut-p53 activities and induced p53-dependent
apoptosis in neuroblastoma in vivo and in vitro [94].
RITA treatment disrupted MDM2/p53-complexation
and inhibited the interaction between MDMX (another
regulator of p53) and p53 [94]. This results is of enormous
importance, particularly in developing compounds that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

simultaneously target wt- and mut-p53 cancer cells. Such
a treatment may reduce the emergence of drug resistance
and enhance the clinical treatment successes [94]. Aziz et
al. demonstrated that cancer cells can develop resistance to
nutlin-3a [131]. Continuous treatment of mut-p53 cancer
cells with nutlin-3a resulted in acquired p53 mutations
[131]. These acquired p53 mutations could be a result of
mis-repaired DNA breaks in cells that initiated, but did
not finish the process of apoptosis [131]. Therefore, the
development of therapies that simultaneously restore wtand mut-p53 could be highly beneficial [94].

Novel drug developments
Xanthone derivatives
Xanthone derivates exhibit antitumor activity [132,
133]. Especially, prenylated xanthone derivatives have
great potentials against breast cancer cell lines (MCF7) harboring wt-p53 and overexpressed MDM2 [132].
Leão and co-workers identified a set of 14 putative
MDM2 ligands with xanthone scaffold by virtual drug
screening leading to the identification of pyroxanthone
1 (3,4-dihydro-12-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H,6H-pyrano
[3,2-b]xanthen-6-on) [16] (Figure 3). This pyroxanthone
derivative was effective against human tumor cells
with wt-p53. It mimicked p53 activators by activating
p53-dependent transcription and upregulation of p53
downstream signals. Pyroxanthone 1 bound to MDM2 in
similar manner as nutlin-3a [16]. However, the compounds
interacted differently. While the interaction between
pyroxanthone 1 and MDM2 involved a hydrogen bond
with Gly58, the nutlin-3a-MDM2 interaction mainly
involved hydrophobic interactions [16]. Pyroxanthone 1
represented a useful lead compound for further structurebased design of more potent analogs.
Trisubstituted aminothiophenes
Another series of inhibitors of the p53-MDM2
interaction are derivatives of a novel scaffold (MCL0527)
[27] (Table 8). These derivatives revealed commendable
MDM2 binding affinities and anti-proliferative effects
against several cancer cell lines [105]. Derivatization at
the 2-amino group and modification at the 3-carboxygroup have been carried out to find more potent inhibitors
[32]. Compound 24, showed the highest binding affinity
effectively inhibited MDM2 binding, it did not exhibit
sufficient cytotoxicity towards tumor cells. However,
compound 9 inhibited both p53-MDM2 binding and tumor
cell proliferation [32].
To examine possible binding modes of MCL0527
and compound 24, Wang and co-workers performed
molecular docking studies [32]. The thiophene ring, an
important core structure, revealed three hydrophobic
substituents in MDM2 binding clefts. The two
4-chlorophenyl groups and one methyl ester/N-benzyl
8936

Siladenoserinols

group mimicked the three key residues Leu26, Phe19
and Trp23 of p53 to form hydrophobic interactions. The
methyl ester of MCL0527 did not occupy the spare room
at the Phe19 binding site, as did the N-benzyl group of
compound 24 [32]. This may be an explanation for its
enhanced affinity. Some of these compounds exhibited
even better anti-proliferative activity against wt-p53
cells than nutlin-3 [32]. Regarding wt-p53 selectivity,
several compounds showed at least 3-fold inhibitory
selectivity in wt-p53 cell lines compared to p53-null
cell lines [32]. Hence, 3,4,5-aminothiophenes may be
valuable contenders in cancer therapeutics targeting the
MDM2-p53 interaction.

The screening of extracts from marine invertebrates
in quest of MDM2 inhibitors led to the identification of
12 sulfonated serinol derivatives (siladenoserinol A-L)
from tunicates belonging to the Didemnidae family
[142]. Each of them contained a 6,8-dioxabicyclo
[3.2.1]octane unit with either glycerophosphocholine or
glycerophosphoethanolamine moieties and inhibited the
p53-MDM2 interaction [142]. Despite their structural
similarities, they showed extreme differences in their IC50
values. siladenoserinol A emerged as the most cytotoxic
compound [142] (Figure 4). More studies are warranted
to optimize the inhibitory effect of siladenoserinols and
elucidate their molecular mechanisms.

Natural products as MDM2 inhibitors

SMALL
MOLECULES:
NEW
OPPORTUNITIES WITH CHALLENGES

α-Mangostin and gambogic acid
α-Mangostin and gambogic acid are prenylated
xanthones derived from the mangosteen fruit of Garcinia
mangostana L. (Clusiaceae) and resin of Garcinia
hanburyi Hook.f. (Clusiaceae),respectively (Table 9).
Both α-mangostin and gambogic acid inhibited the p53MDM2 interaction by binding to MDM2 [134]. Their
cytotoxic activity against human cell lines [135, 136] as
well as their antitumor activity in animals [137, 138] are
already known. Gambogic acid induced apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in human tumor cells harboring wt-p53 [139].
Furthermore, α-mangostin showed cytotoxicity in human
mut-p53 tumor cells [140]. p53-dependent transcriptional
activity increased under treatment with these compounds,
and thereby the negative effect of MDM2 on p53 was
inhibited [134]. The predicted binding interactions
between α-mangostin/gambogic acid and MDM2 are
similar to those between nutlin-3a and MDM2. These
compounds bind near the p53-binding site, filling the space
that is necessary for the interaction with α-helix motifs
in the p53 amino terminal domain. The two compounds
revealed high binding affinities with the residues Gly58,
Asp68, Val75 and Cys77 of the hydrophobic MDM2
binding site. Only gambogic acid formed hydrogen bonds
with residues Gln72 and Phe55 of MDM2 [134, 141].

In the recent years, great efforts have been invested
in the evaluation of novel small molecules that could
act on the MDM2-p53 axis and function as mut-p53
reactivators. Despite initially promising outcomes only
a few of the discovered small molecules exhibited the
right combination of suitable properties to justify their
entry into clinical trials. Many of the compounds were
characterized by poor pharmacokinetic profiles.
RG7112, an advanced compound of the class of
cis-imidazolines with high efficacy and selectivity, is
currently in clinical trials [89]. However, serious side
effects of RG7112 posed a critical issue for its clinical
use [143]. Besides gastrointestinal toxicity (including
nausea and vomiting), hematological toxicity (neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia) was also observed [143-145].
Therefore, strict clinical monitoring is required and the
effects of long-term exposure need to be evaluated [143].
A major obstacle to the clinical use of wt-p53
activators is the acquisition of p53 mutations during
treatment [146]. Maki and coworkers demonstrated that
wt-p53-harboring cancers lead to resistant clones with
acquired p53 mutations, if chronically treated with nutlin3a [131]. At this juncture, it must be kept in mind that
overexpression of MDM4, a MDM2 homolog and another

potent negative regulator of p53, also led to decreased
efficacy of nutlin-induced p53-activity and caused
inadequate responses to nutlin treatment [147].
It is also possible that activation of p53 may lead to
senescence, but not apoptosis, which could be hazardous
in long term use [146]. Mirzayans et al. supported this
assertion that the primary response to p53 activation in
wt-p53 cancer cells may represent a form of senescence
[148]. This may be problematic, if these cells eventually
escape senescence and re-enter cell cycle [146].
A further challenge that needs to be dealt with is the
potential of activating wt-p53 in non-cancerous, healthy
tissues, which could have toxic effects [146]. This effect
has been studied using mice with a hypomorphic allele of
MDM2. These mice showed a phenotype with increased
p53-dependent apoptosis in lymphocytes and epithelial
cells [149]. This did not affect the lifespan of the mice,
but it did affect their size [146]. Thus, it remains to be
seen whether the use of MDM2-antagonists in clinical
trials may exhibit similar effects. This concern enhances
the need for highly specific agents.
Another critical factor to consider is the limited
efficacy of p53-based cancer therapies in cells lacking the
ability to phosphorylate p53Ser46, which subsequently
increases the affinity of p53 to pro-apoptotic genes [150].
Ma et al. determined that neither nutlin-3, nor RITA were
able to induce p53-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are unable to phosphorylate p53Ser46 [150]. Therefore,
dysregulation of phosphorylation in those cancer cells
might be a predicting factor of failed response to therapy.

SMALL MOLECULES IN CLINICAL
DEVELOPMENT
Although some mut-p53 activators as well as
MDM2-antagonists have shown potent activity in
vitro, only a few compounds demonstrated desirable
pharmacokinetic properties and tolerable toxicity profiles
in vivo. Thus, the number of compounds in clinical trials
remains relatively few. Among the best known inhibitors
are cis-imidazolines, such as nutlins and spirooxindoles
[16]. Table 10 gives an overview of some important small
molecules targeting the p53 pathway that have entered
clinical trials.

CONCLUSIONS
Cancer is a complex conglomeration of diseases.
Elucidating the mechanisms of cancer remains elusive.
This necessitates the search for novel strategies to
overcome the challenge. Mutated p53 is not only a key
player in carcinogenesis, but is also associated with
resistance to established cytotoxic anticancer drugs such
as cisplatin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate and

many other chemotherapeutics. However, contradictory
reports pertaining to different aspects of p53’s actions
prevent from devising fool-proof intervention strategies.
For example, while some studies confirmed strong
connections between p53 mutations and drug resistance,
others did not. Methodological differences may at least
in part account for the diverging results in the literature.
Several reasons may contribute to these discrepancies,
e.g. non-standardized methods for p53 status evaluation,
differences concerning patient selection, different
polychemotherapy regimens, duration of follow-up, etc.
Thus, the general prognostic status and role of p53, though
mainly positively confirmed, remains controversial to
some extent. Due to the high frequency of p53 mutations
in human tumors, this tumor suppressor is an important
target for novel anticancer therapies. Several research
teams have dealt with the possibilities of restoring
p53’s function to treat cancer and their efforts showed
worthwhile outcomes. Many novel molecules have been
identified so far to restore p53’s wild-type conformation
and thereby recover its tumor suppressive function. The
results were also promising regarding the combination
of small molecules with conventional anticancer drugs.
For example, synergistic effects between PRIMA-1/APR246 and cisplatin have been shown in vivo and in vitro.
However, further studies are required to develop specific
small molecules with good pharmacokinetic profiles and
acceptable tolerability in patients. Despite the fact that
p53 mutations promote tumorigenesis, other mechanisms
have also to be kept in mind. Among mechanisms
concerning modifications in the pro- and antiapoptotic
balance, even mechanisms involving drug uptake or
export, changes molecular targets or DNA repair as well as
mechanisms concerning the metabolic prodrug activation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or drug inactivation are possible mechanisms causing
drug resistance [151]. The fact that one half of all cancers
express wt-p53 suggests the importance of investigating
other members of the p53 pathway. Recently, small
molecules capable of switching off the activity of MDM2,
is a negative regulator of p53, have been identified. Novel
MDM2 inhibitors increased the activity of combination
treatment with standard chemotherapy. However, only few
compounds possess desirable pharmacokinetic properties
and acceptable toxicity profiles and further investigations
are urgently needed.
In the future, combination therapies consisting
of standard cytotoxic drugs and novel small molecules
targeting p53 and MDM2 may be the key to fight cancer.
Overcoming resistance to classical anticancer drugs by
exploitation of synergistic effects of novel small molecules
bears a huge potential to substantially improve the
outcome of cancer chemotherapy. This goal is certainly not
a trivial task, but is worth doing for the sake of alleviating
the devastating consequences of the disease.
