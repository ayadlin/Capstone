Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in stromal cells is important in prostate
cancer, yet the mechanisms underpinning stromal AR contribution to disease
development and progression remain unclear. Using patient-matched benign and
malignant prostate samples, we show a significant association between low AR levels
in cancer associated stroma and increased prostate cancer-related death at one,
three and five years post-diganosis, and in tissue recombination models with primary
prostate cancer cells that low stromal AR decreases castration-induced apoptosis.
AR-regulation was found to be different in primary human fibroblasts isolated from
adjacent to cancerous and non-cancerous prostate epithelia, and to represent altered
activation of myofibroblast pathways involved in cell cycle, adhesion, migration, and
the extracellular matrix (ECM). Without AR signaling, the fibroblast-derived ECM
loses the capacity to promote attachment of both myofibroblasts and cancer cells,
is less able to prevent cell-matrix disruption, and is less likely to impede cancer cell
invasion. AR signaling in prostate cancer stroma appears therefore to alter patient
outcome by maintaining an ECM microenvironment inhibitory to cancer cell invasion.
This paper provides comprehensive insight into AR signaling in the non-epithelial
prostate microenvironment, and a resource from which the prognostic and therapeutic
implications of stromal AR levels can be further explored.

INTRODUCTION

microenvironment and not due to differences between
patients, and are related to adjacent malignant but not
benign regions of the same prostate. We further show that
androgen signaling in human prostatic myofibroblasts
induces a microenvironment inhibitory to the movement
and invasion of tumor cells, primarily by altering ECM
composition. This protective AR-mediated phenotype in
prostate cancer-associated stroma has implications for
understanding the early stages of cancer progression,
and for the use of androgen withdrawal in the absence of
surgical management.

Prostate cancer causes more than 28,000 deaths
each year in the United States [1]. Critically, 10-33%
of clinically localized cancers treated by surgery will
eventually progress, indicative of undetected preexisting metastatic disease [2, 3]. Although epithelial
differentiation scored by Gleason pathology at diagnosis
aids in prognosis and management, it is imprecise in
prediction of sub-clinical metastases or low grade tumors
at risk of rapid progression. Recent studies of various solid
tumors suggest that the stromal microenvironment may
yield additional diagnostic information and novel avenues
for therapeutic intervention [4-7].
Prostate development and homeostasis requires
bidirectional signaling between epithelial cells and stromal
constituents, including fibroblast and smooth muscle
cells, vasculature, soluble factors and extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins. This signaling is disrupted in cancer
[8-10], where the stroma becomes disorganized, normal
non-malignant prostatic fibroblasts (NPFs) are replaced
by activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and
the composition of the ECM is altered [11-14]. Compared
to NPFs, CAFs exhibit increased proliferation and
migratory behavior [15], induce malignancy in nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells [16-18], and provoke
tumor progression via secretion of signaling factors [1922]. Moreover, genomic-level studies have identified
prognostic CAF-specific gene signatures in digestive,
non-small cell lung, breast and prostate cancers [4, 23-25].
In the adult prostate, activation of epithelial
androgen receptor (AR) by testosterone (T) and
5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is necessary for cell
survival and regulation of seminal fluid proteins including
prostate specific antigen (PSA) [26], which is used
clinically for tumour detection and monitoring. Although
targeting androgens through ablation is therefore an
effective initial treatment strategy for advanced cancer,
most reoccur by refractory reactivation of epithelial AR
[27-29]. In prostate development however, it is the stromal
AR that is necessary for establishment of normal prostatic
architecture, and for epithelial differentiation and function
[30]. Decreased stromal AR expression in cancer has been
associated with tumor resistance to androgen deprivation
[31], and with relapse and progression following radical
prostatectomy [25, 32, 33]. Currently however, we do not
know how decreased stromal AR contributes to prostate
cancer progression, or indeed how androgen action differs
between prostate stromal and epithelial cells.
In this study, we compared AR levels in epithelial
and stromal compartments of patient-matched benign
and malignant prostate tissue, and demonstrate an
association between low stromal AR levels and death
from prostate cancer at one, three and five years post
diagnosis. This is the first time that stromal AR changes
have been shown to be specific to the immediate cancer

RESULTS
Association of AR levels in epithelium and stroma
of benign and malignant prostate tissue with
clinical parameters
The relationship between prostate cancer outcome
and AR levels in stroma and epithelium was investigated
by AR immunohistochemistry on 64 patient-matched
BPH and prostate cancer samples in patients of median
age 87 years (Fig. 1A). Similar to a previous report [33],
the median intensity of AR staining was lower in stroma
than in epithelia (Fig 1A, B). Median AR levels were
similar in malignant and benign epithelia, but were lower
in cancer-associated compared to benign stroma (p=4.1
× 10-8, Fig. 1B, Table 1A). Consistent with established
clinical associations, patients with higher Gleason score
had a greater extent of disease, higher serum PSA levels,
and were more likely to have died from their disease at
censure. Additionally, a positive association between
serum PSA levels was observed for AR content in cancer
epithelia (p=0.004), but not with the other AR measures
(Supplementary Fig. S1A-D). Higher Gleason score
was associated with a higher median AR level in cancer
epithelia (p<0.05) and lower AR in cancer-associated
stroma (p<0.05; Fig.1C, Table 1A). Previous studies
have reported an association between low stromal AR
levels and biochemical recurrence [25, 32-34]. Here we
assessed stromal and epithelial AR levels in paired BPH
and cancer samples from the same patients, allowing
discrimination of changes specific to cancer stroma from
those related to an individual patient or prostate. Critically,
we observed that low AR levels in cancer stroma, but
not BPH stroma, were associated with prostate cancer
related death (p=0.02; Table 1A) at censure, which was
a minimum five years post initial diagnosis. The level of
AR in cancer or BPH epithelia was not associated with
outcome. We next dichotomized the cohort by median
AR level in cancer epithelia or cancer stroma. High
epithelial AR levels was associated with the extent of
disease, Gleason score and serum PSA (p<0.05), but not
with outcome (Table 1B). Conversely, low AR in cancer

stroma was associated with more extensive disease, and
a greater risk of prostate cancer-related death (p<0.05,
Table 1B). At the time of censure, the median prostate
cancer specific survival for patients with low stromal AR
was 622 days, which was significantly less than patients
with high stromal AR expression at 2528 days (p=0.013).
Finally, we observed lower 1, 3, and 5 year prostate cancer
specific survival in patients with low stromal AR (30% at
5 years) compared to high stromal AR (56% at 5 years;
Table 1B). Despite AR in epithelial cells being more
related to clinical parameters of histologically aggressive
disease, our data suggest the intriguing possibility that
AR in fibroblasts plays a more critical role in protecting
against prostate cancer progression. Moreover, AR level
in BPH stroma from the same patients was not associated
with progression, supporting the existence of pathological
cancer associated stroma in prostate cancer.

To investigate the role of stromal AR in cancer, we
utilized in vivo tissue recombination [35]. Human prostate
cancer tissues obtained from four patients with moderate
(Gleason 7) tumors were combined as heterotypic
recombinants with AR positive human prostate PShTertAR myofibroblasts or AR negative PShTert-ctrl and subrenally grafted into immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice.
Human cancer cells combined with both PShTert-AR and
PShTert-controls formed phenotypically similar ductal
structures that stained positive for the human-specific
epithelial marker p63/CK8.18 (Fig. 2A). The survival
of cancer foci, detected as p63-/CK8.18+, was similar
in grafts from the four patients with PShTert-AR (65%,
11/17) and PShTert-ctrl (56%, 13/23) lines. As expected,
a significantly lower proportion of stroma in the grafts
containing PShTert-ctrl myofibroblasts expressed AR
(p<0.01; Supplementary Fig. 1E), with residual stromal
AR expression arising from mouse-derived stroma.
Castration resulted in significantly reduced tumor cell

PShTert-ctrl myofibroblast (p<0.001; Fig. 2B) grafts, a
reduction in cancer p63-/CK8.18+ foci (Fig. 2C), and a
higher percentage of apoptotic cancer cells (caspase-3
positive; p<0.001; Fig. 2D). More importantly, there
was significantly less cancer cell apoptosis in grafts with
PShTert-ctrl cells in comparison to grafts with PShTertAR cells (p<0.05; Fig. 2D). This latter result suggests that
low stromal AR reduces apoptosis of primary cancer cells
in response to androgen deprivation in vivo.

from androgen responses of prostate cancer epithelial
C4-2B cells. These lines have a comparable levels of
AR protein (Fig. 3A), and both have a functional AR
signaling pathway as demonstrated by increased FKBP5
protein levels and probasin reporter (PB3) transactivation
in response to DHT (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S2A).
These responses are AR specific, and could be blocked
by the AR antagonist, BIC (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Transcriptional reporter assays suggest however,
that the DHT response of AR is 10-fold less sensitive in
myofibroblasts than in epithelia (Supplementary Fig. S2B),
and is not due to technical limitations such as reporter level
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). Furthermore, only classical
androgen agonists (DHT and T) and medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA) could produce a transcriptional response
in PShTert-AR cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D), compared
with the expected broader ligand responses in C4-2B
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Nevertheless, the ability
of the AR to stimulate a panel of AR-targeted reporters

matched duplicate cores of BPH and cancer were immunostained with anti-AR antibody. Samples were scored by two independent
researchers, using a scale of high (3), moderate (2), low (1) intensity or absent (0) immunostaining in the epithelia and stroma and averaged
between the duplicate samples and scorers. B. Scores were evaluated in relation to disease state for stroma (St) and epithelia (Ep) and

was consistent between PShTert-AR and C4-2B cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2F).
In order to more precisely define the transcriptional
role for AR in PShTert-AR cells, we performed expression
microarray analysis, identifying 2615 DHT regulated
genes in PShTert-AR myofibroblasts and 1000 in C4-2B
epithelial cells (>0.5 log2 fold change). Importantly, only
254 of those regulated genes were common between the
two cell lines, and half of those (127/254) were regulated
in the opposite direction (Fig. 3B). RT-qPCR analysis of an
independent sample set confirmed the uniquely regulated
(Fig 3C-D) and similarly regulated (Fig. 3E) responses
to DHT in each cell line. The AR-specific nature of
myofibroblast responses was confirmed by their absence in
PShTert-ctrl cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). ChIP analysis
of well-characterized androgen target genes suggests
that divergent AR occupancy of promoters/enhancers is

responsible for the cell-specific regulation by DHT (Fig.
3F-H), consistent with a contemporary understanding of
AR chromatin targeting [36]. We next applied pathway
analysis to the top 1000 regulated genes in each cell line,
which in PShTert-AR cells comprised 390 upregulated
and 610 downregulated genes, and in C4-2B cells 648
upregulated and 352 downregulated genes. DHT-treated
myofibroblasts were enriched in adhesion and ECM
organization, but depleted in cell cycle and migration
(Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, DHT in C4-2B
cells drives processes of lipid and fatty acid synthesis and
migration, and depletion of apoptosis (Supplementary
Table 2). Importantly, a considerable number of pathways
were regulated in opposite directions by DHT in epithelial
and myofibroblast cells, despite limited commonality
in regulated genes (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table 2).
Consistent with the divergent gene responses, DHT

stimulated C4-2B cells to proliferate as previously
reported [37] (p<0.05; Fig. 4A), but inhibited PShTert-AR
growth in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.001, Fig. 4B).
Cell death did not vary significantly between treatments in
C4-2Bs over the 6 day period, but was significantly altered
by all doses of DHT in PShTert-AR cells at days 3 and 4
(p<0.05; 5-20% of viable cells; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Importantly, BIC reversed these effects, confirming AR
mediation of the divergent growth responses (Fig. 4A, B;
right panels).
One mediator of the anti-proliferative effect of
androgen in myofibroblasts may be the fibroblast-specific
androgen regulated F-box protein 32 (FBXO32) gene
product. FBXO32 is a member of the family of DNAlicensing proteins that regulates progression from G1
phase by inhibiting cyclin D1 [38]. To determine whether
FBXO32 could regulate proliferation in AR expressing
myofibroblasts, we used siRNA knockdown (Fig. 4C).

FBXO32 depletion partially reversed the inhibitory effect
of DHT on myofibroblast cell growth over the course of
a five day period (p<0.05; Fig. 4D). Together, the above
results demonstrate that AR in epithelial and myofibroblast
lineages plays distinct roles, one of which is to direct
divergent proliferative responses to DHT.

AR action in myofibroblasts promotes epithelial
cancer proliferation
We next considered whether AR activity in
myofibroblasts could affect epithelial growth. Conditioned
media was collected from PShTert-AR and PShTert-ctrl
myofibroblasts treated with or without DHT. Compared
to vehicle, media from DHT treated AR positive
myofibroblasts increased C4-2B and PC-3 proliferation
by 1.64 and 2.72 fold respectively (p<0.05, Fig. 4E, F).

Media from DHT treated AR negative myofibroblasts
did not alter the proliferative response of either epithelial
line. The addition of DHT to vehicle conditioned media
from PShTert-AR cells enhanced proliferation of C42B but not AR negative PC-3 cells, an effect reversed
by co-treatment with BIC (Fig. 4E, F). In contrast, DHT
supplementation had no effect on the higher proliferation
seen with DHT stimulated myofibroblast conditioned
media (Fig. 4E, F). Residual DHT from the conditioning
process was not responsible for these effects, as highsensitivity transcriptional reporter assays did not reveal
any androgen activity in conditioned media (Fig. 4G, H).

It appears likely from these studies that DHT stimulation
of AR positive myofibroblasts produces secreted, soluble
factors that are pro-proliferative to epithelial cells.

AR action in prostate myofibroblast cells controls
adherence of myofibroblast cells
As pathways involving adhesion were highly
enriched in DHT treated myofibroblasts, we next assessed
whether this translated to altered attachment. Treatment
with DHT had no effect on trypsinization of C4-2B cells
or PShTert-ctrl cells, but increased retention of PShTert-

6D) was only observed in gelatin conditioned by DHTtreated PShTert-AR cells, but not with gelatin conditioned
by vehicle-treated PShTert-AR cells, or with vehicle- or
DHT-treated PShTert-ctrl line (Fig. 6C, D). We also
identified a significant decrease in invasion of the cancer
cells through DHT-treated PShTert-AR gelatin matrix
in comparison to matrix conditioned by vehicle treated
PShTert-AR or DHT-treated PShTert-ctrl cells (Fig. 6E).
Candidate RT-qPCR analysis confirmed DHT
upregulation of ECM proteins with adhesive properties
(i.e. COL1A1, COL3A1, COL4A6, and FBN1), and
inhibition of ECM degrading enzymes (i.e. MMP1; Fig.
6F). Using ELISA, dose dependent DHT regulation
of Collagen 1 protein was confirmed (p<0.05; Fig.
6G). Significantly, in a set of human patient canceradjacent, BPH, and normal fibroblasts (CAF, BAF, and
NPF respectively) we observed increased expression of
FBXO32 and COL4A6 genes when treated with DHT in
CAFs and BAFs only (p<0.05, Fig. 6H), and a marked
decrease in expression of MMP1 expression in all three
cell types (p<0.05, Fig. 6I). Collectively, the above results
suggest that stromal/fibroblast AR may act to alter the
composition of the ECM, resulting in a pro-adhesive, antimigratory matrix.

AR cells by 25.1 ± 3.6% to 44.7 ± 1.8% (p<0.0001, Fig.
5A-C). This response was DHT dose dependent and
reversible by BIC (p<0.05; Supplementary Fig. S5),
thus demonstrating AR involvement. Furthermore, DHT
treatment significantly increased attachment of PShTertAR cells by 33-44% at 30 min in a dose-dependent
manner, suggestive of an additional non-genomic effect
(p<0.05, Fig. 5D, E). This response was measurable for
4 h and could be reversed by BIC (Fig. 5D), but did not
occur with either C4-2B or PShTert-ctrl cells.
We recently reported that hydrogen peroxideinducible gene 5 (Hic-5/TGFB1I1), a predominantly
fibroblast-specific AR coregulator and a component of the
focal adhesion (FA) complex, plays an important role in
AR-mediated activity in myofibroblasts [39-41]. To assess
whether Hic-5 might be involved in DHT/AR-mediated
adherence, we utilized siRNA knockdown in PShTertAR cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Compared to negative
siRNA control, depletion of Hic-5 abolished the effect of
DHT on myofibroblast adherence (Fig. 5F, G). Similarly,
Hic-5 knockdown eliminated the positive effect of DHT
pretreatment on myofibroblast attachment (Fig. 5 H, I).
AR however retained the capacity to regulate FKBP5
expression when Hic-5 was depleted, implying that
decreased adherence was not due to absolute loss of AR
activity (Supplementary Fig. S6). Together, these results
suggest an active role for AR in myofibroblast attachment,
mediated via cellular interactions with a known AR
coregulator.

DISCUSSION
Extensive analyses of cancerous epithelia have
failed to significantly improve prediction of pre-existing
prostate metastases or subsequent progression [44].
However, it has been known for over a decade that the
level of stromal AR is inversely related to Gleason
score, response to therapy, metastasis and subsequent
biochemical relapse [25, 31-34]. This is the first study
to associate decreased stromal AR levels with increased
prostate cancer-related death, even in the context of
older patients with significant disease burden at the time
of diagnosis and initial management. Importantly, this
now establishes that there is no maximum age at which
stromal AR content cannot provide additional prognostic
information. Conversely, since Gleason score in our cohort
was found to be related to traditional tumor characteristics
of poor prognosis, such as serum PSA, cancer-related
death and epithelial AR content, the stromal AR results are
likely reflective of what also happens in younger patients.
In addition to confirming a protective role for stromal AR
against prostate cancer progression, our data suggest that
analysis of stromal AR levels and/or function may provide
useful information regarding tumor aggressiveness and/or
early metastasis, and could guide clinical decision making
in younger and older men alike. This is particularly
important in the latter group where there is a pervasive
belief that older men are more likely to die with prostate
cancer than from it.
Metastasis of solid tumors is accomplished by
either proteolytic migration, involving secretion of ECM

AR action in prostate myofibroblasts alters the
ECM to increase cancer cell attachment and
decrease cancer cell migration and invasion
As we had observed increased attachment and
altered expression of ECM components with DHT
treatment in the myofibroblast cells (Supplementary
Table 2), we next measured adherence of epithelial cells
to the myofibroblast-deposited matrix. PC-3 attachment
to matrix generated by DHT treated PShTert-AR cells
was increased 31 ± 12% over matrix from vehicle treated
cells, and could be inhibited by BIC (p<0.05, Fig. 6A).
In contrast, PC-3 adhesion to matrix from PShTert-ctrl
cells was unaffected by ligand (Fig. 6A). Similarly, PC-3
migration over ECM generated by DHT treated PShTertAR cells was significantly less than migration over ECM
produced under vehicle control treatment after 7 (22±3%
vs 30±3.5%) and 11 (1±1.3% vs 7±2.4%) hours (p<0.05,
Fig 6B, Supplementary Fig. S7). As previously reported,
cancer cell migration was significantly faster over ECM
than cancer cell migration over plastic alone [42]. We next
assessed the adherence of cancer cells to a myofibroblast
conditioned 3D-ECM as previously described [43].
Consistent with the above results, a significant increase

degrading enzymes to create space into which cells
move, and/or amoeboid (non-proteolytic) squeezing of
cells through the ECM. The amount and arrangement of
ECM fibers, enzymes, and ECM pore size are capable of
altering each type of migration, and have been implicated
in malignant disease [45-47], and studies of malignant
ovarian and breast cancers have identified defects in matrix
protein cross-linking that render ECM more susceptible to
proteolytic degradation [48, 49]. We show here that AR
action in myofibroblasts leads to decreased expression
of enzymes involved in ECM digestion and increased
expression of key components of the ECM, both in our
model cell line and primary patient fibroblasts. These
results are supported by our findings that AR positive
myofibroblasts produce a more adhesive ECM when
treated with DHT, which inhibits migration and provides a
less invasive environment for prostate cancer cells. Further
work will be required to distinguish the role of androgen
regulation of matrix degrading proteases. Collectively,
our data suggest that fibroblast AR may play a key role
in regulating cell attachment, and in organization of the
ECM, and that a loss of stromal AR creates a passive
ECM environment that is less adhesive for cancer epithelia
and more conducive for metastatic spread (Fig. 6H). We
predict that defining the precise contribution that AR
makes to ECM composition may inform on early disease
spread and therefore overall patient outcome.
It appears from our results and those of others that
stromal AR may also promote prostate cancer proliferation,
as suggested here by the production of an unidentified
soluble mediator, and/or ECM-bound growth factor [5052]. On the surface, this appears at odds with clinical
data demonstrating an association between low stromal
AR and death from prostate cancer. Given decreased
stromal AR expression throughout progression however
[13, 50, 53, 54], or as shown here with increasing Gleason
score, these two findings may not be as paradoxical
as might be thought. Indeed, stromal AR may be proproliferative in early prostate cancer; exogenous tumors
in mice grow larger when associated with AR sensitive
stroma [55], and are inhibited by stroma lacking AR [50].
Conversely in vivo knockdown of stromal AR was found
to be more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in early
stages of progression rather than at later stages [50, 56].
In this study, there was no difference between take rate or
cellular morphology of human tumors grafted with either
AR positive or AR negative myofibroblasts. Instead, we
found in grafts containing AR positive myofibroblasts
that cancer cells exhibit increased apoptosis following
castration. Collectively, these findings suggest that stromal
AR can play a pro-proliferative, pro-adhesive and/or antimigratory role in prostate cancer. It is entirely possible that
stromal AR is pro-tumorigenic in very early stage disease,
but prevents metastasis of evolving epithelial cancer cells
by altering the composition and permissiveness of the
ECM.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, this manuscript is the first to show
that unique androgen/AR transcriptional responses in
prostate myofibroblasts play an important role in stromalmediated alterations to the ECM and microenvironment.
Clinically, it will be important to determine the key factors
affected by a loss of stromal AR that may influence patient
outcome and could be exploited by targeted therapies. The
precise composition of the ECM may be one such key
mediator of epithelial cancer cell invasiveness and thus
indicative of patient outcome, tumor aggressiveness and
treatment response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical cohorts
The South Australia Prostate Cancer Clinical
Outcomes Collaborative (SA-PCCOC; http://www.sapccoc.com/) tracks men diagnosed with prostate cancer
in the South Australian public health system. Using the
SA-PCCOC database, we identified 66 sequential patients
whom underwent TURP for symptomatic relief of BPH
urinary obstruction at the Repatriation General Hospital
(RGH; Daws Park, South Australia) between 2000 and
2007, in which there was (i) a first diagnosis of prostate
cancer on histological Gleason grading, (ii) cancer
comprising >5% of the specimen, and (iii) sufficient areas
of BPH and cancer in each sample from which multiple
cores could be obtained. Areas of BPH and cancer were
identified by H&E staining and mapped onto paraffin
embedded material by a pathologist. Duplicate five mm
cores of BPH and cancer from each individual were then
used to generate tissue microarrays. Clinical data relating
to each patient was acquired from the SA-PCCOC
database. Sample and data acquisition was performed
according to protocols approved by the Flinders Medical
Centre and RGH Ethics Committees (Protocol #042/10).
Immunohistochemistry was performed with the AR
N-20 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and, detected
using the LSAB+ System-HRP kit (Dako Laboratories,
CA, USA). Staining was scored additively by two
researchers in three independent fields from 0 (no staining)
to 3 (very intense staining), yielding sample scores of 0-9
in epithelial and stromal compartments of both cancer
and BPH. No stromal compartment achieved very intense
staining. The mean sample score from the two researchers
yielded the AR staining intensity score. Differences in
staining intensity, Gleason Score, serum PSA and percent
prostate cancer were assessed using two-tailed MannWhitney U tests. In samples dichotomized by median AR
level, differences in prostate cancer-specific death were
assessed using Barnard’s Exact test. Significance was set
at p<0.05.
Human tissue was obtained from consented patients

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

in accordance with Human Ethics Research Approvals
34306 at Epworth Hospital, 03-14-04-08 at Cabrini
Hospital and RMO 2006/61082004000145 at Monash
University, and processed as previously published [18].
Briefly, tissue from patients with BPH or Gleason score
7 prostate cancers were extracted from TURP and radical
prostatectomy specimens respectively. Primary fibroblasts,
representing CAFs, BAFs and NPFs were isolated from
patient specimens, cultured in RPMI with 5% FCS and
100nM testosterone or equivalent vehicle (ethanol), and
assessed in vitro between passages 3-6. The integrity of
primary fibroblast cultures was confirmed in vitro by
growth properties, immunological markers and RNA
expression, and their tumorigenic potential in vivo using
tissue recombination with BPH-1 cells.

ChIP was performed as described previously [59],
using semi-confluent PShTert-AR or C4-2B cells were
treated for 4 hours with 10nM DHT or vehicle. Cells were
then formaldehyde fixed and sonicated to produce 3001500 bp fragments. Lysates were pre-cleared with yeast
tRNA and protein G sepharose, and immunoprecipitated
overnight with 4 µg of AR N-20 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
antiserum. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the
beads, digested with proteinase K and was DNA purified
by phenol-chloroform extraction. Resulting DNA samples
were assessed by RT-qPCR in triplicate, with primers
listed in Supplementary Table 1. Data was calculated
as percent input and normalized to non-specific control
(NC2). Results are representative of three independent
experiments.

Cell lines
For in vitro experiments C4-2B [57] and PC-3
(ATCC, VA, USA) prostate cancer epithelial cells,
telomerase immortalized human prostate stromal
myofibroblast cells expressing AR (PshTertAR) or
matched empty vector control (PShTert-ctrl) [31], and
WMPY human prostate fibroblasts expressing Hic-5 or
scrambled shRNA [58] were used. All cell lines were
authenticated via Short Tandem Repeat testing in 2014,
completed at CellBank Australia (NSW, Australia). In
experimental conditions cells were incubated in stripped
medium (Phenol Red Free-RPMI 1640 with 5% dextran
coated (DCC) FBS) supplemented with 10 nM DHT or
vehicle, or 10 µM bicalutamide (BIC). For conditioned
media, confluent PShTert-AR and PShTert-ctrl cells were
incubated in stripped medium (Phenol Red Free-RPMI
1640 with 5% dextran coated (DCC) FBS) supplemented
with 10 nM DHT or vehicle. Media was collected at 6, 12,
18, 24, 36, or 48 h after initial treatment, centrifuged to
remove debris, filtered and frozen, and subsequently used
neat for transactivation assays or at a 1:1 dilution with
fresh stripped media for other cell studies.

ELISA
ELISA was used to measure collagen 1 levels
in media collected from confluent PShTert-AR
myofibroblasts treated with 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich, NSW, Australia) and either DHT, vehicle
control and or BIC. Media collected from six independent
treated confluent cells was plated into 96-well Maxisorp
(Nunc, Simga Aldrich) plates and incubated overnight at
4oC. Plates were washed in PBS supplemented with 0.1%
Tween (PBST), blocked in 2.5% BSA and washed in
PBST, plates were probed with rabbit anti-collagen type
1 antibody (0.25 µg/ml, Rockland Immunochemistry, PA,
USA) for 3 h and detected via a europium-tagged antirabbit secondary antibody. The concentration of collagen
was subsequently fluorescently detected using 340 nm
excitation/615 nm emission spectra.

Tissue recombination

Transactivation assays

Renal capsule tissue recombination grafting of
PShTert-AR or PShTert-ctrl cells with pieces of patientderived primary human prostate cancer tissue into NODSCID mice was performed and analyzed as previously
described [18, 35, 60]. Briefly, PShTert-AR or PShTertctrl cells (2.5 X 105) were combined with 2 mm X 2
mm X 1 mm pieces of patient-derived primary human
prostate cancer tissue in 30 µl of collagen/RPMI 1640 +
5% FBS with 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin for 24 h, and
grafted under the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice for 8
weeks. Mice were castrated, and grafts allowed to grow
for an additional 3 days before being removed, paraffinembedded and sectioned. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 (Sigma-Aldrich), caspase-3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and AR
(Sigma-Aldrich) was performed.

Transactivation studies were performed as
described previously [59] using Lipofectamine 2000™
(Life Technologies, CA, USA) or LTX-plus (Life
Technologies) for transfection of luciferase constructs.
Following transfection, cells were treated with 0.1-1000
nM of steroids or equivalent vehicle (ethanol) control
for 22 h. Results are presented as mean (± SEM) of six
independently transfected wells.

Conditioned matrix

RNA extracted from cells treated with either DHT
or vehicle using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Melbourne,
Australia), was analyzed using Affymetrix 1.0st Gene
Arrays. Data was Bioinformatically analyzed using either
in R using Gene Ontology categories, or in R or using
DAVID Bioinformatics Resources http://david.abcc.
ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp (46, 47).

Matrices produced from confluent fibroblasts treated
with 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 nM DHT or vehicle
or 10µM BIC, were decellularized with EDTA and used in
adhesion assays (above) and trypsinization assays adapted
from previous descriptions [62].

Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)

3D-matrices

cDNA created from sample RNA was analyzed
via RT-qPCR as previously described [61], using SYBR
Green (Biorad) and primer pairs detailed in Supplementary
Table 1. Data is presented relative to GAPDH, PPIA,
and mRPL19 as per GeNorm (http://medgen.ugent.
be/~jvdesomp/genorm/#introduction).

3D-matrices were produced from DHT or vehicle
treated fibroblasts seeded into gelatin coated wells as
previously described [43]. After decellularization with
extraction buffer containing PBS, 0.28% ammonium
hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5% Triton-X (SigmaAldrich), the remaining 3D-matrix was used for adherence,
proliferation, invasion, and motility/gap closure assays.
When the cells had grown to 100% confluence,
media was replaced with stripped media supplemented
with 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 nM DHT or equivalent
vehicle control. Treatment was repeated every 48 h. After
8 days, myofibroblasts were removed via an extraction
buffer containing PBS, 0.28% ammonium hydroxide
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich).
Remaining 3D matrix was gently washed in PBS prior to
adherence, proliferation and invasion assays.
For cancer cell gap closure assays, into each well,
sterile silicon culture-inserts (Ibidi 80209) were positioned
into wells containing 3-D matrices, and PC3 cells (3.5 x
104 cells per chamber) in stripped medium were aliquoted.
Following 16h by incubation, Ibidi inserts were removed,
leaving a 500µm cell-free gap. Migration of PC3 cells
across the gap was monitored for 0, 3, 7, 11, and 15 h
time-points, using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 with HBO
100 microscope illuminating system (Zeiss, Göttingen,
Germany). Migration was measuring as cell-free gapclosure using AxioVision Rel 4.8 software, and analysed
with the MRI Wound Healing Tool (ImageJ software,
version 1.47v).

Immunoblot
Protein lysates in RIPA buffer were prepared as
previously described [59] and immunostained with antiAR (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FKBP5 (H100,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-alpha tubulin (05-829,
Millipore, Bedford, MA), or anti-β-actin (A1978, SigmaAldrich).

Proliferation, adhesion and motility
Proliferative response of PShTert-AR or C4-2B cells
to DHT and or BIC was measured in quadruplicate via
Trypan blue exclusion. Adhesion of PShTert-AR, PShTertctrl, or C4-2B cells was measured using an adhesion assay
as described previously [62]. Briefly, 5 X 104 PShTert-AR,
PShTert-ctrl, or C4-2B cells were added to 24-well plates
containing treatment media and left to adhere for 15-240
min at 37oC. Media was removed and cells were washed
with PBS before manual counting. Cellular attachment
(trypsinization resistance) was measured using a crystal
violet assay adapted from a previous study [62]. Briefly,
PShTert-AR or C4-2B cells were plated in stripped media
(5 X 104 cells/well in 96 well plates) overnight and
treated with 1-100 nM DHT ± 10 µM BIC or equivalent
vehicle control for 16 h. Cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with trypsin for 2.5 - 15 min. Cells were washed,
ethanol fixed and stained with 1% crystal violet solution.
Dye was eluted from cells with 10% glacial acetic acid
and the concentration measured at an absorbance of 595
nm. Motility and invasion was tested described previously
[63], using calcein labelled C4-2B cells were applied to
modified Boyden chambers (ChemoTx, Neuro Probe).
Calcein AM was measured in the bottom wells using a
FLUOstar OPTIMA plate reader at 480 nm excitation and
