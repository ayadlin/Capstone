ABSTRACT
Optimal animal models of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are necessary
to overcome the current lack of novel targeted therapies for this malignancy. Here
we report on the establishment and characterization of patient-derived primary
xenografts (PDX). Patient tumors were grafted under the renal capsule of mice
and subsequently transplanted over multiple generations. Patient tumor and PDX
were processed for analysis of copy number variations by aCGH, gene expression
by microarray, and expression of target pathways by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
One PDX harbouring an FGFR3 mutation was treated with an inhibitory monoclonal
antibody targeting FGFR3. Five PDX were successfully established. Tumor doubling
time ranged from 5 to 11 days. Array CGH revealed shared chromosomal aberrations
in the patient tumors and PDX. Gene expression microarray and IHC confirmed that
PDXs maintain similar patterns to the parental tumors. Tumor growth in the PDX with
an FGFR3 mutation was inhibited by the FGFR3 inhibitor. PDXs recapitulate the tumor
biology of the patients' primary tumors from which they are derived. Investigations
related to tumor biology and drug testing in these models are therefore more likely
to be relevant to the disease state in patients. They represent a valuable tool for
developing precision therapy in MIBC.

Despite optimal surgical therapy, approximately one half
of these patients will progress to advanced disease [4].
Response to systemic chemotherapy is rarely durable in
these patients and most will succumb to their disease.
While targeted therapy has revolutionized the treatment
of many cancers [5] no significant breakthroughs have
been made for decades to enhance the systemic therapy
of MIBC [6].
Analysis of tumor biology by molecular
manipulation, identification of relevant diagnostic and
predictive biomarkers, and preclinical testing of novel
antineoplastic therapeutic agents critically depend on
conclusive in vivo models of human cancer. For bladder

INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES
An estimated 74, 690 incident cases and 15, 580
deaths from bladder cancer are expected to occur in the
United States in 2014. This will make it the fourth most
common cancer in men and the twelfth most common
cancer in women, which is representative also of other
industrialized countries [1]. Approximately three quarters
of these patients have non-muscle invasive tumors [2],
which have a high disposition for recurrence after curative
treatment, and a subset is at high risk for progression to
invasive disease [3]. The remaining quarter of patients
present with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

cancer research multiple cell lines are available which
reliably grow to tumors after orthotopic inoculation into
immunodeficient mice (orthotopic xenograft) [7, 8]. The
major shortcoming of these models relates to the cell
lines used. During years of cultivation, passaging and
expansion, genetic drift has markedly altered these cells
from their original genotype and phenotype [9], so that
they are no longer truly representative of the disease
they are modeling [10]. They likely underrepresent the
true tumor heterogeneity seen in patients, which impacts
our ability to predict and study therapeutic resistance
[11]. Finally xenograft tumors inoculated by injection
of cultured cells are deficient of their original stroma
which has been shown to highly influence tumor biology
and growth [12]. Under these circumstances the ability
of current xenografts to predict efficacy of therapeutic
agents is limited and in vivo observations are only rarely
transferrable to the clinical setting.
In order to address these limitations much effort
has been made to establish models in which specific
genetic characteristics and stromal architecture of the
original tumor are reliably retained. These pre-requisites
are satisfied by bypassing the establishment of cell lines
from human cancers and instead grafting intact cancer
tissue into immunocompromised mice (patient derived
primary xenografts, PDX). Successful and reliable
inoculation of such PDX has, however, proved challenging
[13–15]), and satisfactory engraftment rates in most
series have only been obtained for highly-aggressive
or poorly differentiated cancers [16]. The inoculation

of patient tumor under the renal capsule has proven to
be most reliable [17], which presumably relates to an
abundant blood supply and rapid neo-vascularisation of
the grafted tissue. Engraftment rates > 95% have been
obtained for several cancer entities with this technique
[18, 19], but it has not yet been tested for bladder cancer.
The subcutaneous compartment has so far been the most
popular graft site for PDX derived from bladder cancer
patients, but engraftment rates have been discouraging
[16, 20].
In the present study we report our early experience
with the establishment of bladder cancer PDX by grafting
representative cancer tissue under the renal capsule of
immunocompromised mice. Besides demonstrating the
feasibility and reproducibility of this model, we have
performed extensive molecular characterization of the
PDX compared to the patient tumors from which they
were derived.

Patient demographics and clinicopathologic features
for the 7 harvested tumors are summarized in Table 1.
Successful PDX growth in at least one mouse was observed
for all 7 patient-derived tumors implanted under the murine
renal capsule. Six PDX grew sufficiently for transfer into
further mice. One model (LTL524) had to be excluded
after being identified as having human B cell lymphoma

doubling times ranging from 5 – 11 days.

that patient tumor and paired PDX have similar genomic
profiles of bladder genes. The RF15 scores for primary
tumor samples versus their corresponding PDX illustrate
a high correlation, although the PDX demonstrated
overall a higher risk than the patient tumor [Figure 2C].
This high correlation between the scores suggests that
the genomic profile of the primary tumor is preserved in
the PDX; however the shift towards higher scores in the
PDX samples might be a reflection of less stromal tissue
and a more homogonous cellular population found in the
PDX . A clustering of the samples was conducted based on
the expression of 118 bladder cancer genes [Figure 2D].
This gene set created by integrating three sources: (1) the
17 genes representing potential targets for therapy, (2)
the 68 genes associated to distinct subgroups of invasive
bladder cancer, and (3) 42 bladder cancer genes from
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
pathways. This clustering revealed that corresponding
pairs (patient tumors and corresponding PDX) tended to
cluster together, although primary tumors LTL490 and
LTL543 as well as PDX LTL490 and LTL543 clustered
together. Differential expression analysis conducted at
the probeset level using Fold Change method revealed
that some patients have distinct transcriptome profiles
compared to their paired PDX. For example, more than
2000 probesets (out of 1.4M) are differentially expressed
(Fold change = 2) between LTL543 and LTL490 and their
paired PDX. LTL489, LTL392 and LTL488, on the other
hand, have less than 200 probesets differentially expressed
in comparison to the paired PDX. Of the 2266 probesets
differentially expressed in LTL543, the vast majority
(2194) were overexpressed in the PDX model compared
to the primary tumor. Interestingly, MALAT and NEAT1
were among the most overexpressed probesets in the PDX
model, and IGKC was among the most downregulated
genes. IGKC was found also to be downregulated in the
other four PDXs. These changes are consistent with a
selection of more aggressive tumor features in the PDX
compared to the primary tumor.

PDXs retain genetic characteristics of patient
tumors
aCGH
We performed aCGH on all samples and revealed
striking concordance in the copy number profiles between
patient tumors and their matched PDX [Figure 1A,
1B]. Copy number changes in the PDX models were
more prominent, presumably due to reduction in the
contribution of non-tumor cells such as macrophages
and lymphocytes. The breakpoints within the resolution
of the technology were located in identical locations. In
the recent Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study of bladder
urothelial carcinoma [22], 20 genes were flagged as
falling within statistically significant focal copy number
peaks across the 131 tumors examined. Remarkably, 19 of
these 20 genes showed congruent copy number change in
at least one of our xenograft tumors, although only four
genes were affected by high copy gain or homozygous loss
(CDKN2A, CCND1, ZNF703 and YAP1) [Figure 1C].
Especially the copy number loss of CDKN2A in all
models histologically classified as urothelial carcinoma
(4/5 models) is in concordance with the TCGA data
where 47% of non-squamous tumors exhibit this specific
alteration. This demonstrates the potential utility of our
models to recapitulate the chromosomal copy number
variation commonly detected in patient tumors.
Mutation analysis FGFR3 gene
As mutations in the FGFR3 regularly occur
in urothelial cancer of the bladder and are amenable
to targeted therapies the primary tumors and their
corresponding PDX were analyzed for mutations in
this gene by direct sequencing. Only one patient tumor
(LTL392) harbored a mutation, which was located in exon
7 (S249C). This was retained in the corresponding PDX
[Figure 4A].

Histology and immunohistology
Microscopic examination of patient tumors and
corresponding PDX of different generations revealed
retention of morphological characteristics (cell and tissue
architecture). H&E sections of a patient tumor (LTL488),
its corresponding lymph node metastasis and PDX are
exemplarily depicted in Figure 3A. The analysis of
immunohistological features was compiled in a heatmap
[Figure 3B]. Staining intensity showed a close correlation
for various proteins (except p-RB, Her-2 and CD31)
between patient tumors and their corresponding PDX.

PDXs retain transcriptional and morphologic
characteristics of patient tumors
Gene expression profiling
Analysis of gene expression was performed in
patient tumors and corresponding PDX for 17 common
genes whose substrates are potentially amenable for
targeted therapy [Figure 2A] and for a selection of 68
bladder cancer related genes associated with distinct
subtypes of invasive bladder cancer [23] [Figure 2B]. The
core level gene expression was used to build heatmaps
that show no single gene is highly differentially expressed
between patient tumor and matched PDX suggesting

DISCUSSION

Our approach to inoculate and transplant
representative tumor tissue under the renal capsule
builds on success establishing similar PDX from tumors
derived from other organs [17–19], and addresses
most limitations of existing models. We were able to
establish transplantable PDX lines in 71.4%, with
one of the two failures being due to concomitant
establishment of lymphoma in the host mouse. This
constitutes a remarkable increase compared to previous
models [16]. Although the subcapsular renal site is
not the physiologic, orthotopic location for bladder
cancer, it has emerged as the optimal environment
for PDX survival and growth. We have not attempted
primary implantation in the bladder due to the
presumed technical challenge. We recognize that our
PDX are derived from a selection of high risk tumors
(disproportionately high representation of pT4 and
pN+ tumors), which was not intentional. Nevertheless
we were able to demonstrate that even our few models
recapitulated a large proportion of the chromosomal
copy variation commonly detected in bladder cancer
[22]. We are currently developing PDX from lower risk
tumors, including non-muscle invasive tumors.
As PDX lines are established by the grafting of
representative tumor pieces that contain stromal cells and

The existence of animal models that reliably mimic
human malignancies is a basic requirement in oncologic
research for the identification of molecular targets and
subsequent development of novel targeted therapies [24].
In vivo models of individual patient-derived cancers
represent the gold standard in order to personalize
therapy by determining chemosensitivity prior to clinical
administration of a therapeutic agent [25]. In this study
we have successfully established PDX from patients with
bladder cancer, which retained genetic and morphological
characteristics of the original tumor. We have demonstrated
that these are suitable tools for drug efficacy studies.
Tissue grafts of several different tumor types
including bladder cancer have previously been transplanted
into various different compartments and organ sites in mice
[13–15, 26]. In most cases, however, successful passage
rates were low and the majority of established transplantable
PDX lines originated from less differentiated or anaplastic
primary tumors. This is true also for bladder cancer, which
has previously been grafted primarily in the subcutaneous
compartment [26], and successful passage rates even in
the most recent studies have only been acceptable in very
aggressive cancers [16, 20].

extracellular matrix in addition to cancerous epithelium,
mutual interactions between these components maintain
tumor biology representative of the original patient tumor
[12]. Histological analyses clearly demonstrated in our
models that specific histological features such as tissue
architecture and cellular morphology are maintained for
up to 13 generations of propagation. The same is true at a
gene copy number (aCGH), RNA expression (microarray)
and protein expression (IHC) level. This implies that
drug efficacy or other molecular studies in this model are
more likely to correlate to similar studies in patients. One
particularly attractive feature of this model is the ability
to grow patient tumor in a mouse and test the efficacy of
specific candidate drugs before administering these drugs
to the patient. While such modeling does take time and
patients usually require immediate therapy, this paradigm
would be feasible in patients with residual MIBC in their
cystectomy specimen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
These patients have a high risk of subsequent systemic
failure, but usually receive no immediate adjuvant therapy
due to a lack of efficacious agents. They have abundant
tumor tissue available for molecular analysis and primary
xenografting. Drugs can be tested in the PDX model and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subsequently administered to the patient at the time of
recurrence. This remains a concept that requires rigorous
testing.
A principal limitation of current PDX models
of bladder cancer is their inability to metastasize. Our
experience with orthotopic injection of human bladder
cancer cell lines has demonstrated that local growth in
the bladder causes morbidity requiring euthanasia prior
to metastasis [8]. While we did not observe metastasis in
any of our bladder cancer PDX, we have done so in other
tumor systems, indicating that this model is suitable for the
study of metastasis, and we continue to establish bladder
cancer PDX with the intent of developing metastatic lines.
The principal limitation of our study is the small
number of established PDX lines and the fact that a
drug efficacy study was performed in only one of these
models, and we have not yet taken the step of testing a
drug in this model prior to administration in a patient
with bladder cancer. We have, however, extended our
model system for PDX under the renal capsule to include
bladder cancer, and have demonstrated that these models
closely resemble the original patient tumor from which
they were derived.

and to test the efficacy of targeting agents in this model has
been demonstrated. We speculate that this will be a valuable
tool for developing molecularly targeted precision therapy
in patients with bladder cancer in the future.

Santa Cruz)), and mouse monoclonal anti-P53 (1:3000,
M7001, DAKO (Burlington, ON, Canada)). Staining was
performed with a corresponding secondary antibody by the
Ventana autostainer model Discover XT (Ventana Medical
System (Tuscon, AZ, USA)) which included an enzymelabeled biotin streptavidin system and solvent-resistant 3,
30-diaminobenyidine Map kit. Specific protein expression
was detected at 20x magnification and graded on a four
point scale (0–3). For assessment of proliferative index
Ki67 was analysed at 40x magnification in a minimum
of five randomly selected high-power fields and staining
intensity estimated in percentage (number of positive
stained nuclei for Ki67 to total number of nuclei in tumor).
Additionally tumor neovascularisation was determined by
staining for CD31 (average count of blood vessels in five
high-power fields).

Patient tumor samples
Between 2010 and 2012 tissue specimens from
7 patients undergoing radical cystectomy for MIBC at
Vancouver General Hospital were obtained. The study was
approval by the Clinical Research Ethics Board (Protocol
number: A10-0350) and each patient provided informed
consent for use of his/her tissue. Representative tumor
tissue was immediately cut into small pieces for further
processing after harvesting from the patient.

Animals and tumor transplantations
All animal procedures were performed according
to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care (CCAC). The protocol was approved by the Animal
Care Committee of the University of British Columbia
(Protocol Number: A10-0350). Fresh human tumor pieces
were bilaterally grafted under the renal capsule of female
NOD-SCID mice and passaged serially for establishment
of bladder cancer PDX as previously described [19]. PDX
tumors were harvested at humane endpoints and processed
for further analysis.

Protein extraction and western blot analysis
Samples containing 40mg of protein from lysates
of harvested PDX were separated by SDS-PAGE on
10% Tris-HCl gels and subsequently transferred to
nitrocellulose filters. After blocking (Odyssey Blocking
buffer; LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE)) the blots
were incubated with the following primary antibodies:
rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Akt (1:1000, #4060, Cell
Signalling), mouse monoclonal anti- phospho- Erk1/2
(1:1000, #4374, Cell Signalling), mouse monoclonal
anti-phosphotyrosine (1:1000, 05-321X, EMD Milipore
(Darmstadt, Germany) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Vinculin
(1:2, 500, PA5-19842, Thermo Scientific). Subsequently
the filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing 0.1% Tween and then incubated with
Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:5, 000; Invitrogen).
Specific proteins were detected using Odyssey IR imaging
system (LI-COR Biosciences).

Histology and tissue microarray construction
Pieces of patient and PDX tissue were fixed in
formalin and embedded in paraffin. 4 μm thick sections
were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
analysed by a genitourinary pathologist (L.F.) with respect
to tumor morphology. A tissue microarray (TMA) was
constructed of 10mm duplicate cores originating from
representative areas of patient and PDX tumors. For
immunohistochemistry the following primary antibodies
were applied to 4 μm sections: mouse monoclonal antiCD31 (1:50; M0823, DAKO (Burlington, Ontario,
Canada)), goat polyclonal anti-Clusterin-α (1:1000,
sc-6420, Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX)), rabbit monoclonal anticyclin D1 (1:100, RM-9104, Thermo Scientific (Rockford,
IL)), rabbit monoclonal anti-EGFR (1:25, #4267, Cell
Signaling (Danvers, MA)), rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR3
(1:600, F0425, Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada)),
rabbit monoclonal anti-Her2 (1:25, #2165, Cell Signaling),

RNA/DNA isolation
Fresh patient tumor and PDX specimens were
immediately frozen after harvesting and stored at
−80°C. After thawing, RNA and genomic DNA was
isolated in a clean environment by the RNeasy and
DNeasy® Tissue Kit (QIAGEN (Valencia, CA)),
respectively. RNA and DNA purity was validated by
measuring the ratio of 260nm/280nm absorbance with a
Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
Samples with a ratio under 1.87 were excluded from
further analysis.

Gene expression analysis
RNA was amplified and labeled using the
Ovation WTA FFPE system (NuGen (San Carlos,
CA)) and hybridized to GeneChip Human Exon
1.0 ST oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix

Array comparative genomic hybridization

(Santa Clara, CA)) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Microarray quality control was
performed using Affymetrix power tools and custom
metrics. Normalization and core level summarization of
the microarray data was performed using SCAN [27].
The generated data can be accessed at the GEO (ID:
GSE67312). Hierarchical clustering, using Euclidean
distance as a dissimilarity metric and Ward function as
agglomeration method, is used to assess if the matching
PDX - primary tumor sample pairs have a similar genomic
profile. A previously developed 15-marker genomic
signature (RF15 score) predictive of MIBC recurrence
was used to determine if the genomic risk score would be
robust in the PDX samples. This signature was developed
using a cohort of 133 patients with organ-confined disease
who underwent radical cystectomy between 1998 and
2004 [23]. In a subsequent validation cohort of 66 patients
the signature achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.65–0.91]
[28]. This model was used as a genomic test to make a
comparison between risk of recurrence associated with the
gene expression found in the PDX samples and primary
tumor samples.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
was performed on the Agilent Human Genome CGH
Microarray® platform (Agilent (Santa Clara, CA)) at
the VPC. Genomic DNA from each patient tumor and
corresponding PDX was quantified by the Nanodrop 2000®
spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and a quantity of
0.5 μg was fluorescently labeled according to the NimbleGen
enzymatic labeling protocol (NimbleGen Arrays User Guide
CGH Analysis v6.0, Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI)).
5 μg of each Cy5-labeled sample was co-hybridized with
5 μg of gender matched Cy3-labeled human reference DNA
(Promega (Madison, WI)) on Agilent SurePrint G3 Human®
CGH 8x60K microarrays (AMDID 021924). Arrays were
scanned with the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner at a 3 μm
scan resolution, and quantified with Feature Extraction®
10.0.1.1 software (Agilent). CGH processed signal was
then uploaded into Nexus CGH® software (Biodiscovery
(Hawthorne, CA)) and processed using BioDiscovery’s
FASST2 Segmentation Algorithm to estimate copy number
state. These state values were then used to make calls based
on a log-ratio threshold. The significance threshold for
segmentation was set at 5.0E-6 also requiring a minimum
of 3 probes per segment and a maximum probe spacing of
1000 between adjacent probes before breaking a segment.
The log ratio thresholds for single copy gain and single
copy loss were set at 0.2 and -0.23, respectively. The log
ratio thresholds for two or more copy gain and homozygous
loss were set at 1.14 and -1.1 respectively. Upon loading of
raw data files, signal intensities are normalized via division
by mean. All samples are corrected for genomic control
(GC) wave content using a systematic correction algorithm.
All samples were additionally analyzed specifically for
copy number changes of genes that fall within regions of
significant GISTIC (genomic identification of significant
targets in cancer) peaks identified in a recent report from the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [22].

FGFR3 mutation analysis
Exons 7, 10 and 15 were amplified by PCR using
Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies
(Burlington, ON, Canada)). The following primers were
used: 5′-CGGCAGTGGCGGTGGTGGTG-3′ (sense)
and 5′-AGCACCGCCGTCTGGTTGGC-3′ (antisense)
for exon 7, 5′-CCTCAACGCCCATGTCTTT-3′ (sense)
and 5′-AGGCAGCTCAGAACCTGGTA-3′ (antisense)
for exon 10 and 5′- GATGATCGGGAAACACAAA-3′
(sense)
and
5′-TAGACTCGGTCAAACAAGG-3′
(antisense) for exon 15 (Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO)).
Cycling variables were set as following: 5min at 94°C,
35 cycles of 15sec at 94°C, 30sec at 68°C, followed by
5 min at 68°C and then a hold at 4°C (exon 7); 5min at
94°C, 35 cycles of 15sec at 94°C, 30sec at 60°C, 30sec
at 68°C, followed by 5 min at 68°C and then hold at
4°C (exon 10 and 15) [29]. PCR products were purified
using Qiagen MinElute spin columns, quantified by
Nanodrop, and then sequenced directly with 400nM 7R
primer (exon 7), 10R primer (exon 10) or 15F primer
(exon 15) by BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Life
Technologies) on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems (Burlington, ON, Canada)). Cycle sequencing
conditions were set as following: 96°C 1min, 25 cycles
of 96°C 15sec, 62°C 30sec, 65°C for 2.5 min (exon 7);
96°C 1 min, 25 cycles of 96°C 15 sec, 55°C 30sec, 65°C
3min (exon 10 and 15). Sequence chromatograms were
analyzed manually for the presence/absence of the SNP
at known locations. S249C SNP in Exon 7 was confirmed
by sequencing with 7R primer by NAPS (Nucleic Acid
Processing Service) at Michael Smith Laboratories at
UBC (Vancouver, BC, Canada).

In vivo monitoring of xenograft growth
Measurement of tumor growth was performed with
the Vevo 770® small animal imaging platform (Visual
Sonics (Toronto, ON, Canada)). A high frequency RMV
706 ultrasound scanhead (20 – 60 MHz), which allowed a
lateral resolution of 30 micron and frame rates up to 240
fps, was used. 3D ultrasound was performed with scanning
of the tumor as a whole in 0.1mm steps. The tumor volume
was determined using the Visual Sonics imaging software
package by analysis of every fifth picture according to the
user manual [30].

In vivo efficacy study of targeted therapy
FGFR3 targeting antibody R3Mab [31] and
isotype control antibody (human IgG1) were provided
by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). For study of
21530

Oncotarget

drug efficacy, the PDX line LTL392B (4th generation) was
transplanted into 10 animals. On day 18, after reaching
an average tumor volume of 115.3mm3, the animals were
randomized into 2 treatment groups based on tumor
burden. R3Mab (30mg/kg) or control antibody (30mg/kg)
was injected intraperitoneally twice weekly for 3 weeks.
Quantification of tumor response was performed by
ultrasound imaging (1x/week) and determination of tumor
burden at necropsy on day 41 [19] For statistical analysis
the mean tumor weights with their standard deviations
were calculated and the significance of differences
measured by Student’s t test (GraphPad Software Inc. (San
Diego, CA). P < 0.05 was considered significant.
