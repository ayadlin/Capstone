Abstract
Small-molecule inhibitors of the CDK4/6 cell-cycle kinases
have shown clinical efﬁcacy in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
metastatic breast cancer, although their cytostatic effects are
limited by primary and acquired resistance. Here we report that
ER-positive breast cancer cells can adapt quickly to CDK4/6
inhibition and evade cytostasis, in part, via noncanonical cyclin
D1-CDK2–mediated S-phase entry. This adaptation was prevented by cotreatment with hormone therapies or PI3K inhibitors, which reduced the levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and
other G1–S cyclins, abolished pRb phosphorylation, and inhibited activation of S-phase transcriptional programs. Combined
targeting of both CDK4/6 and PI3K triggered cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX)
models, resulting in tumor regression and improved disease
control. Furthermore, a triple combination of endocrine ther-

apy, CDK4/6, and PI3K inhibition was more effective than
paired combinations, provoking rapid tumor regressions in a
PDX model. Mechanistic investigations showed that acquired
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition resulted from bypass of cyclin
D1–CDK4/6 dependency through selection of CCNE1 ampliﬁcation or RB1 loss. Notably, although PI3K inhibitors could
prevent resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, they failed to resensitize cells once resistance had been acquired. However, we
found that cells acquiring resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors due
to CCNE1 ampliﬁcation could be resensitized by targeting
CDK2. Overall, our results illustrate convergent mechanisms
of early adaptation and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors that enable alternate means of S-phase entry, highlighting
strategies to prevent the acquisition of therapeutic resistance to
these agents. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2301–13. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

monal therapies is inevitable in metastatic breast cancer, and
frequent in early breast cancer (1). A common feature of ERpositive breast cancer is high expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1;
refs. 2–4). In mouse models of ER-positive breast cancer, cyclin
D1 is required for oncogenesis (5). Cyclin D1 through CDK4 and
CDK6, initiates cell-cycle entry by phosphorylating and inactivating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) that uncouples from E2F
transcription factors (6). The release of E2F transcription factors
initiates an S-phase transcriptional program promoting E-type
cyclin and CDK2 expression and cell-cycle progression (7).
Inhibition of CDK4/6 with small-molecule inhibitors such
as palbociclib (PD0332991), abemacilib (LY2835219; ref. 8),
and ribociclib (LEE011; ref. 9) has shown substantial promise
in early-stage clinical studies, and for palbociclib in randomized studies in combination with hormone therapy (10, 11).
CDK4/6 inhibition with palbociclib has led to substantial
increased disease control in ER-positive breast cancer, although
CDK4/6 inhibitors typically induce tumor stabilization with only
modest increased rates of tumor shrinkage (11). A major limitation of CDK4/6 inhibitors is cytostasis, as CDK4/6 inhibition
blocks cell-cycle progression in G0–G1 (12, 13). This cytostatic
response limits the response rate to CDK4/6 inhibitors in
advanced breast cancer, and may limit the effectiveness of
CDK4/6 inhibitors in early breast cancer where the aim is to
eradicate micrometastatic disease.

Substantial improvements have been made in the treatment
of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, targeting the
ER with antiestrogen hormonal therapies or through estrogen
withdrawal by aromatase inhibitors. However, resistance to hor1

PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 40% of ER-positive
breast cancers (3), and activation of the PI3K signaling is prominent as cancers become resistant to endocrine therapy (14). Prior
work has identiﬁed PI3K inhibitors as synergistic partners of
CDK4/6 inhibitors (15, 16); however, the subset of cancers that
would beneﬁt from this combination has not been clearly
deﬁned.
Here, we show that CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer cells
is limited by an inability to induce complete and durable
cell-cycle arrest, due to early adaptation mediated by persistent G1–S-phase cyclin expression and CDK2 signaling. We
show that therapies that inhibit the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway synergize with CDK4/6 inhibitors through blockade of
early adaptation combined with apoptosis induction. We go
on to elucidate the mechanisms of acquired resistance of ERpositive breast cancers to CDK4/6 inhibition that occur
through RB1 loss or CCNE1 ampliﬁcation, and identify therapeutic strategies for acquired resistant cancers with CCNE1
ampliﬁcation.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
All cell lines were obtained from ATCC or Asterand and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines
were banked in multiple aliquots on receipt to reduce risk of
phenotypic drift and identity conﬁrmed by STR proﬁling with the
PowerPlex 1.2 System (Promega)
Compound screen
MCF-7 and T47D cells were screened with three commercially
available drug libraries from Prestwick (http://www.prestwickchemical.com/prestwick-chemical-library.html), US drugs (http://
www.msdiscovery.com), and Enzo (http://www.enzolifesciences.
com/BML-2841/screen-well-reg-fda-approved-drug-library/). Cells
were seeded into 384-well plates and half of the plates treated with
compound library plus DMSO (vehicle) and half with compound
library plus palbociclib at the survival fraction 80 (SF80) concentration. Cell number was assessed after 72-hour exposure using
CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Each
plate in the screen was performed in triplicate. To assess the effect of
compound on sensitivity to palbociclib, the log2 ratio between
growth in palbociclib plates and vehicle plates was assessed and
expressed as a z score, with SD estimated from the median absolute
deviation as described previously (17).
Cell staining, image acquisition, and analysis
Cells were seeded in 384-well View Plate (6007460, PerkinElmer), exposed to palbociclib for 24 or 72 hours, and
labeled with 10 mmol/L
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd;
B5002-1G, Sigma-Aldrich) or 5 mmol/L EdU (A10044, Invitrogen) for the indicated times prior to ﬁxation and permeabilization. Cells were stained with mouse anti-BrdUrd
(BD55627) and secondary antibody Alexa 488, anti-tubulin
(MCA78G, AbD Serotec) and secondary Alexa 647, and
DAPI (D9542, Sigma-Aldrich). EdU was stained with Click-iT
Cell Reaction Buffer Kit (C10269) using 5 mmol/L AlexaAzide647 (A10277, Invitrogen). Four ﬁelds per well were
imaged with the Operetta microscope, 10 objective lens. The
number of nuclei (DAPI staining), percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells (BrdUrd staining vs. number of nuclei), and cell area

2302 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

were measured in more than 1,000 cells using Columbus
software (Perkin Elmer). Experiments were performed in
triplicates.
Droplet digital PCR
Genomic DNA was extracted from cells and formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded samples with the DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
The detection of cylcin E1 ampliﬁcation by digital PCR was
performed with a CCNE1 Taqman Copy Number Variation
Assay (Hs07158517_cn) and a TERT TaqMan Copy Number
Reference Assay (4403316) from Life Technologies on a
QX-100 droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) system (Bio-Rad). To
detect RB1 pM695fs 26, we designed a primer probe combination targeting RB1 c.2083-2084insA: pM695fs 26. Digital
PCR was performed as described previously (18, 19). The
ratio of CCNE1:TERT was calculated using the Poisson distribution in QuantaSoft. The RB1 pM695fs 26 fraction was
assessed as published previously (18).
Statistical analysis
For in vitro studies, all statistical tests were performed
with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 or Microsoft Excel. Unless
stated otherwise, P values were two-tailed and considered
signiﬁcant if P < 0.05. Error bars represent SEM of three
experiments.

Results
Early adaptation to CDK4/6 inhibition in ER-positive breast
cancer cells
We assessed the steadiness of cell-cycle arrest induced by
CDK4/6 inhibition in the ER-positive breast cancer cell lines
MCF-7 and T47D. Palbociclib treatment induced acute cellcycle arrest after 24 hours as shown by reduced BrdUrd
incorporation (Fig. 1A), and after 72- to 96-hour treatment
led to a senescence-like morphology (cell ﬂattening with
increased cell area) and reduced cell number (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, prolonged palbociclib
treatment over 72 hours was also accompanied by a low-level
recovery of cells entering S-phase (BrdUrd positive) that were
signiﬁcantly smaller than the arrested cells (Fig. 1A and B).
Accordingly, palbociclib inhibited pRB phosphorylation after
24 hours treatment (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B), but
pRB S807/811 phosphorylation and cyclin E2 expression
returned to almost baseline levels despite continuous exposure
to palbociclib over 72 hours. In addition, palbociclib induced
cyclin D1 accumulation over a 72- to 96-hour period (Figs. 1C
and D and 2A), likely reﬂecting arrest of cells in G1. Restoration of pRB S807/811 phosphorylation occurred even when
palbociclib was replaced every 24 hours over a 72-hour period,
indicating that the restoration did not reﬂect degradation of
palbociclib (Fig. 1D). Cyclin E1 was expressed at low levels
and we did not observe signiﬁcant changes in response to
palbociclib (data not shown; ref. 20). Dual pulse labeling with
EdU for 30 minutes followed by BrdUrd for 24 hours conﬁrmed that cells were able to transition G1–S phase despite
CDK4/6 inhibition (green, BrdUrdþEdU, Fig. 1E). In addition, cells transition through S-phase into later stages of the
cell cycle (red, BrdUrdEdUþ, Supplementary Fig. S1C).

Early Adaption and Acquired Palbociclib Resistance

Combination of CDK4/6–PI3K inhibition prevents early
adaptation
Our experiments suggest that there is early adaptation that
limits the cell-cycle arrest induced by CDK4/6 inhibition. To
investigate the factors that underlie this early adaptation, we
conducted a sensitization screen to identify compounds that
synergized with palbociclib (see Materials and Methods). A
3,520 compound library was used in MCF-7 cells, with a repeat
screen with 640 targeted anticancer drugs in T47D cells (Fig. 1F
and G and Supplementary Fig. S1D). Many cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs had an antagonistic interaction with palbociclib (Supplementary Fig. S1E), as anticipated through palbociclib-arresting
cells in G0–G1 (21).
Multiple compounds that inhibit the PI3K pathway, such as
PDK, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors, and the selective estrogen
receptor modulator tamoxifen, synergized with palbociclib in
both cell lines, along with IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor and
the pan-CDK inhibitor ﬂavopiridol in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1F
and G and Supplementary Fig. S1D). Short-term cell survival
(Supplementary Fig. S1F and S1G, combination index 0.26
for 250 nmol/L GDC-0941/500 nmol/L palbociclib) and longterm clonogenic assays (Fig. 1H) conﬁrmed increased sensitivity to palbociclib when combined with either the PI3K
inhibitor GDC-0941, the AKT inhibitor MK2206, or the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus. In MCF-7 and T47D cells, the combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibition blocked the reentry
into S-phase (Fig. 1I), suggesting that PI3K inhibition synergized with CDK4/6 inhibitors, in part, through blocking early
adaptation.
Across a large panel of breast cancer cell lines, the combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibition was active speciﬁcally in
ER-positive cell lines with activating mutations in the PI3K
pathway ( , P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Supplementary
Fig. S2A and S2C). The combination of palbociclib and GDC0941 did not increase sensitivity compared with monotherapy
in vitro in cells with intrinsic resistance to either palbociclib
(such as the pRb-null cells) or GDC-0941, suggesting the
patient population for combination development (Supplementary Fig. S2B, S2D, and S2E).
Early adaptation to CDK4/6 inhibitors is mediated by
G1–S-phase cyclins and CDK2
To investigate how PI3K inhibition blocked early adaptation,
we studied the CDK4/6–pRb pathway by Western blot analysis
in MCF-7 and T47D cells exposed to palbociclib, GDC-0941, or
the combination for 72 to 96 hours (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). We noted that AKT phosphorylation was modestly increased by chronic exposure to palbociclib, which correlates with sustained expression of E2F-induced G1–S-phase
regulators such as cyclin E2 or CDK2 (Fig. 2A), and failure to
fully inhibit pRB phosphorylation (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Combination of PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibition
resulted in loss of pRB S807/811 and S780 phosphorylation,
with concomitant reduction of cyclin E2 and CDK2 expression.
Moreover, palbociclib-induced cyclin D1 accumulation was
markedly reduced by the addition of GDC-0941. IGF1R/InsR
inhibitors also synergized with CDK4/6 inhibition in MCF-7
cells, highlighting the role of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling
in CDK4/6 inhibitor adaptation, potentially by feedback activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (Supplementary Fig. S3B–
S3D). Our results suggest that early adaptation following to

www.aacrjournals.org

CDK4/6 inhibition depends on PI3K signaling whereby sustaining expression of G1–S-phase cyclins.
We noted that the pan-CDK inhibitor ﬂavopiridol also sensitized tumor cells to palbociclib in the compound screen
(Fig. 1F) evoking a potential role for another CDK in early
adaptation. To explore a compensatory role of CDK2 in mediating early adaptation, we undertook transient mRNA knockdown experiments. Silencing of CDK2 alone with siRNA had a
very limited effect on S-phase entry and cell area likely because
ER-positive MCF-7 cells rely on CDK4/6 for ensuring pRB
phosphorylation (Fig. 2B and C). In contrast, in combination
with palbociclib, CDK2 knockdown increased the fraction
of cell cycle–arrested cells and increased cell area (senescence
like morphology) both using pooled or individual siRNAs
(Fig. 2B, C, and Supplementary Fig. S3E–S3G). Silencing CDK2
with siRNA (Fig. 2D) or with the CDK2 inhibitor CY202
(Fig. 2E) also resulted in further suppression of pRB S807/
811 phosphorylation in combination with palbociclib.
We further investigated how CDK2 enabled cell-cycle progression despite CDK4/6 inhibition. We reasoned that cyclin
D1 upregulation in cells treated with palbociclib alone could
elicit a CDK2-coordinated progression into S-phase (Figs. 1C
and D and 2A). Silencing of cyclin D1 both with pooled
or individual siRNAs had a prominent effect in untreated
MCF-7 cells, reﬂecting the key role of CDK4/6-cyclin D1
controlling baseline cell cycle (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S3H). Nonetheless, increased cell-cycle arrest was induced
by cyclin D1 knockdown in palbociclib-treated cells, which
also resulted in a more profound effect on pRB dephosphorylation than palbociclib alone (Fig. 2F). Accordingly, CDK2
and cyclin D1 coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2G), suggesting
that cyclin D1 may contribute to CDK2 activation by direct
interaction. The interaction between CDK2 and cyclin D1
remained intact despite treatment with palbociclib, but was
abolished by GDC-0941 treatment likely due to cyclin D1
downregulation following PI3K blockade. In agreement with
cyclin E2 being an E2F-target gene and partner of CDK2, we
observed that cyclin E2 expression recovered despite CDK4/6
inhibition (Fig. 1C), which could lead to sustained CDK2
activation. In line with this, knockdown of cyclin E2 significantly increased cell-cycle arrest in combination with palbociclib (Fig. 2C).
Overall our data suggest that early adaptation that follows
to CDK4/6 blockade is mediated by the noncanonical CDK2/
cyclin D1 complex promoting pRb phosphorylation recovery. The
cyclin E2 rebound is likely a consequence of CDK2/cyclin D1
activity and eventually triggering S-phase entry. Importantly, PI3K
signaling blockade downregulates G1–S-phase cyclins that lead to
CDK2 activation and act synergistically to suppress tumor cell
proliferation.
Combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibition increases
apoptosis
We examined whether the effects of the PI3K inhibitor combination were solely through a greater induction of cell-cycle
arrest and/or induction of apoptosis. Although, the arrest induced
by palbociclib was accompanied by reduced PARP cleavage (at 96
hours), GDC-0941 alone or in combination with palbociclib
increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 2H), active caspase-3/7 (Fig. 2I),
and reduced senescence-like morphology (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). To assess whether the addition of GDC-0941 could induce

Early Adaption and Acquired Palbociclib Resistance

apoptosis even in cells previously arrested by palbociclib, we
staged the addition of GDC-0941 for 6, 18, and 24 hours after
72 hours of palbociclib pretreatment, again observing an induction of caspase-3/7 activation compared with palbociclib alone
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). The staged addition of GDC-0941 to
cells arrested with palbociclib resulted in near complete loss of
colonies, demonstrating that PI3K inhibition induced death of
palbociclib-arrested cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Therefore,
the combination is highly effective, resulting in profound loss of
clonogenic capacity through profound cell-cycle arrest accompanied by apoptosis.
The triplet combination of ER, CDK4/6, and PI3K targeting has
greater efﬁcacy than either doublet
In clinical trials, both CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors
are being developed in combination with hormone therapies in
ER-positive breast cancer. We examined whether the triplet
combination of the estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant, palbociclib, and GDC-0941 would be more effective than
the corresponding doublets, in particular, compared with the
palbociclib–fulvestrant doublet. In both MCF-7 and T47D cells,
continuous exposure to the triplet resulted in signiﬁcant reduction of colonies, compared with either doublet (Fig. 3A). The
clonogenic assays were repeated with 10 days of treatment,
followed by washout for 7 days to allow for regrowth of any
surviving cells (Fig. 3B). In all doublets, surviving cells were
able to repopulate colonies, whereas in the triplet, there was no
regrowth of colonies. In addition, the triplet combination
reduced more pRB S807/811 phosphorylation and CDK2 and
cyclin E2 expression compared with the palbociclib–fulvestrant
doublet (Fig. 3C) and increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D).
Therefore, the well-documented increased synergy between
endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibition likely shares the
same mechanism as CDK4/6 and PI3K combined inhibition
through inhibition of G1–S regulators, with the addition of
GDC-0941 further decreasing expression of G1–S-phase regulators and leading to apoptosis.
Combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibition is efﬁcacious in
patient-derived tumor xenografts
We examined whether CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibitor combinations were efﬁcacious in vivo. We generated patient-derived
tumor xenograft (PDX) from patients with ER-positive breast
cancer, and treated these with combinations of the CDK4/6
inhibitor LEE011 and the PI3Ka inhibitor BYL719. We chose
PDX191, a CCND1-ampliﬁed tumor, and PDX244, a model

harboring an ESR1 p.Y537S mutation with concomitant loss in
CDKN2A/B (encoding for p16INK4A and p15INK4B, respectively). In model PDX191, both CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibitor
monotherapy exhibited signiﬁcant tumor growth reduction
compared with vehicle-treated controls, but resulted in disease
progression (Fig. 4A; 48% and 66% relative tumor growth
increase at day 43, respectively, vs. day 1). Notably, the combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibition resulted in signiﬁcantly greater antitumor activity and tumor regressions (45%)
when compared with each agent alone. The combination of
CDK4/6 with PI3K inhibition was well tolerated on the basis of
minimal changes in mouse body weight (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). LEE011 had no effect on PI3K pathway markers (data not
shown) in tumor xenografts but reduced phophorylated pRb
(Fig. 4B). The combination of both drugs increased PARP
cleavage and reduced the expression of S-phase regulators
mimicking the result observed in vitro.
We examined the triplet combination of fulvestrant, LEE011,
and BYL719 in PDX244. The triplet combination induced

(87%) in tumor volume after 47 days of treatment (Fig. 4C).
Of note, this experiment was conducted using a recently described "one animal per model and treatment" (1  1  1)
experimental design, with enrichment of the triplet combination
arm (22).
Acquired palbociclib resistance occurs through gain of cyclin E1
ampliﬁcation or RB1 loss
We next developed cell lines with acquired resistance to palbociclib, to investigate the mechanism of acquired resistance, and
contrast with early adaptation. Palbociclib-resistant MCF-7
(MCF-7pR) and T47D (T47pR) cells were derived through chronic
exposure to 1 mmol/L palbociclib during 3 to 4 months. In MCF7pR and T47DpR, CDK4/6 inhibition failed to induce the acute
cell-cycle arrest and cell death seen in parental MCF-7 and T47D,
conﬁrming resistance (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S5A).
We sought to understand the mechanisms through which the
cell lines had acquired resistance. Western blots of lysates from
MCF-7pR and T47DpR cells reveled loss of pRB expression in
T47DpR (Fig. 5B). MCF-7pR cells underwent a substantial
increase in cyclin E1 expression and CDK4/6 inhibition failed to
reduce pRb phosphorylation compared with parental MCF-7
(Fig. 5B). Copy number proﬁling from exome sequencing of
MCF-7 and MCF-7pR, conﬁrmed relative ampliﬁcation of CCNE1
and multiple de novo mutations in resistant MCF-7pR cells (Fig. 5C

Acquired mutation in RB1 induces resistance to CDK4/6
blockade in PDX
To establish whether similar mechanisms of acquired
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors are seen in vivo, we took advantage of the CDK4/6-sensitive PDX244 model and developed acquired resistance to CDK4/6 blockade with LEE011
(Fig. 6A). During the ﬁrst 40 days of treatment, 5 of 8 CDK4/6

inhibitor-treated tumors underwent regression compared with
the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 6A). After this period, tumors
started to regrow under drug pressure. Western blot analysis
showed a decrease of pRb protein levels in 4 of 7 CDK4/
6-acquired resistant tumors and a sustained expression of the
E2F target cyclin E2, in contrast to CDK4/6 inhibitor-sensitive
PDX244 (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7).
We hypothesized that the CDK4/6-acquired resistance
phenotype was due to the gain of a genomic alteration, as
resistance was conﬁrmed in a serial passage of an LEE011relapsed tumor (PDX244LR1; Fig. 6C). Genomic characterization of PDX244LR1 showed the acquisition of an RB1
frameshift mutation (RB1 p.M695fs 26). Interestingly, despite
the presence of an RB1 mutation, transplanted tumors
remained partially sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition. To investigate the potential reason for this, we performed Western
blot analysis of PDX244LR1 tumors. We conﬁrmed that treatment with LEE011 did not result in downmodulation of
cyclin E2 and noted that the levels of pRb expression were

Palbociclib

resulted in substantially increased cell-cycle arrest and reduction in cell growth in combination with palbociclib (Fig. 5G
and H and Supplementary Fig. S5F and S5G). None of the
combinations had an acute effect in pRb-low T47DpR cells
(Fig. 5G). Altogether, these results highlight that CDK4/6resistant cells have lost their dependence on CDK4/6-cyclin
D1 signaling, likely due to the acquired CCNE1 and RB1
alterations. Although pRb-low cells may have lost the G1
-restriction point and are no longer susceptible of CDK4/6
or CDK2 blockade, CCNE1-ampliﬁed cells retain sensitivity to
CDK2 blockade.

variably low across the individual tumors (Fig. 6D). We
therefore reasoned that the acquired RB1 mutation could
be subclonal. Digital PCR analysis of PDX244LR1 tumors
showed that the RB1 mutation allele fraction increased from
0.25 in control tumors to 0.55 in CDK4/6-treated tumors
(Fig. 6E). This result suggests that the RB1 mutation was
subclonal in the resistant tumor, and that CDK4/6 inhibition
resulted in selection of the RB1-mutant population (Fig. 6E).

Combination of CDK4/6–PI3K inhibitors does not resensitize
cancers with acquired resistance but prevents CDK4/6
resistance
We next addressed whether CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibitor
combinations could resensitize cell lines with acquired
CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance. Although MCF-7pR and T47DpR
cells exhibited similar levels of sensitivity to GDC-0941, GDC0941 was not able to fully resensitize cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors (Fig. 7A and B). The combination did not suppress S-phase
entry in the resistant MCF-7pR and T47DpR (Fig. 7C), and was
unable to fully suppress pRb phosphorylation and cyclin E2 or
CDK2 expression (Fig. 7D). The lack of combination effect was
more evident in the pRb-low T47DpR cell line. In both cell
lines, the addition of GDC-0941 substantially reduced cyclin
D1 expression, yet this did not result in combination efﬁcacy,
conﬁrming the loss of dependence to cyclin D1 of cells with
CDK4/6 inhibitor acquired resistance (Fig. 7D).

To assess whether PI3K could prevent the acquisition of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in vivo, we utilized the PDX244 model
in the chronic treatment setting. Although LEE011 single agent
induced a short partial response in 5 of 8 individual tumors,
combination therapy resulted in a prolonged complete response
in 7 of 9 tumors, preventing the outgrowth of CDK4/6-resistant
tumors (Fig. 7E). Therefore, our data support the use of CDK4/6
and PI3K inhibitor combinations in CDK4/6 treatment–na€ve
tumors, to maximize tumor shrinkage and prevent the acquisition
of resistance.

Discussion
Proliferation of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer
is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4
and CDK6), which promote progression from the G1-phase
to the S-phase of the cell cycle (23–28). CDK4/6 inhibitors
have shown activity in breast cancer, particularly in combination with endocrine therapy (13, 23, 29). Efforts are being
made to identify markers of sensitivity or resistance to CDK4/
6 blockade. In the current study, we explore resistance to
CDK4/6 inhibitors and the molecular mechanisms that determine sensitivity to novel combination therapies in ER-positive breast cancers. We show that CDK4/6 inhibition as
monotherapy is limited by early adaptation, with cyclin D1
and G1–S cyclins mediating residual cell-cycle entry via CDK2.
This highlights the importance of combining CDK4/6

promotes ongoing cell-cycle entry in ER-positive breast cancer, in
other cancer types, cyclin E1 may be the driver of primary
resistance (16, 20, 33), likely reﬂecting tumor or cell-type differences in the cyclins that promote G1–S transition. In MCF-7 cells,
cyclin E1 levels remained low despite CDK4/6 inhibition and
cyclin E1 silencing in combination with palbociclib failed to
reduce pRb phosphorylation, suggesting that cyclin E1 does not
promote early adaptation in our model (data not shown).
Although CDK4/6 inhibition induces cell-cycle arrest accompanied by phenotypes of senescence, a low level of cells continue
to reenter the cell cycle, and on withdrawal of CDK4/6 inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

the cell-cycle arrest/senescent phenotype is readily reversible
(Supplementary Fig. S4D; refs. 34–36). The efﬁcacy of palbociclib
is also limited by inhibition of apoptosis during the cell-cycle
arrest. We demonstrate that the combination of CDK4/6 and PI3K
inhibition induces a different mode of arrest compared with
palbociclib alone, characterized by not only sustained growth
arrest, but also increased apoptosis in vitro, as well as tumor
regression in vivo.
Acquired resistance to palbociclib in vitro reﬂects loss of dependence on cyclin D1-CDK4/6, although the molecular mechanism
of this loss of dependence is multifactorial through loss of pRb

expression and overexpression of cyclin E1. Similar mechanisms
of acquired resistance to palbociclib have recently been reported
in ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro (37). Although the PI3K
inhibitor GDC-0941 still modulates cyclin D1 expression in
acquired resistant cells, the acquired lack of dependence on cyclin
D1 results in an inability to restore sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. However, we show that an upfront combination of CDK4/
6-PI3K inhibitors prevented the development of resistance. Our
data suggest that combinations of PI3K inhibitors and CDK4/6
inhibitors are best employed clinically in the treatment ER-positive CDK4/6 inhibitor-na€ve cancers, namely, pRb proﬁcient with
low levels of cyclin E1 expression tumors.
In summary, these ﬁndings support the clinical development of
combinations of CDK4/6 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in ERpositive cancers. Our data also support the development of triplet
combinations of CDK4/6, PI3K, and fulvestrant in ER-positive
breast cancer. These combinations have the potential to overcome
the cytostatic nature of CDK4/6 inhibition, and are being taken
forward in multiple clinical trials.
