Abstract
Disrupting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F
(eIF4F) complex offers an appealing strategy to potentiate the
effectiveness of existing cancer therapies and to overcome resistance to drugs such as BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Here, we identiﬁed and characterized the small molecule SBI-0640756 (SBI756), a ﬁrst-in-class inhibitor that targets eIF4G1 and disrupts the
eIF4F complex. SBI-756 impaired the eIF4F complex assembly
independently of mTOR and attenuated growth of BRAF-resistant
and BRAF-independent melanomas. SBI-756 also suppressed
AKT and NF-kB signaling, but small-molecule derivatives were
identiﬁed that only marginally affected these pathways while
still inhibiting eIF4F complex formation and melanoma
growth, illustrating the potential for further structural and

functional manipulation of SBI-756 as a drug lead. In the gene
expression signature patterns elicited by SBI-756, DNA damage,
and cell-cycle regulatory factors were prominent, with mutations in melanoma cells affecting these pathways conferring
drug resistance. SBI-756 inhibited the growth of NRAS, BRAF,
and NF1-mutant melanomas in vitro and delayed the onset and
reduced the incidence of Nras/Ink4a melanomas in vivo. Furthermore, combining SBI-756 and a BRAFi attenuated the
formation of BRAFi-resistant human tumors. Taken together,
our ﬁndings show how SBI-756 abrogates the growth of BRAFindependent and BRAFi-resistant melanomas, offering a preclinical rationale to evaluate its antitumor effects in other
cancers. Cancer Res; 75(24); 5211–8. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

therapies targeting both BRAF and associated pathways, such as
MEK and PI3K (3), albeit, with limited success. Furthermore, 50%
of melanomas, such as those harboring NRAS and NF1 mutations,
lack BRAF mutations, and are thus not amenable to BRAFi therapy
(4). Thus, tumor chemoresistance and the lack of therapies for
BRAF wild-type (WT) tumors remains a major clinical challenge.
We identiﬁed BI-69A11, which inhibits both AKT and NF-kB
signaling (5) and attenuates melanoma development and progression in both human xenografts and mouse genetic models (6–
8). In efforts to improve the biophysical properties of BI-69A11,
we identiﬁed SBI-0640756 (SBI-756), which retained the biologic
effects of the original compound while possessing superior pharmacokinetics. Extended characterization of SBI-756 identiﬁed
eIF4G1 as its direct target. eIF4G1 is a large scaffolding protein
that is a key component of the eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4F (eIF4F) complex (9). Small translational repressors,
eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP), associate with eIF4E, and impair
its binding to eIF4G and the eIF4F complex assembly (10).
mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BPs leads to their
dissociation form eIF4E, enabling eIF4E interaction with eIF4G
and the formation of the eIF4F complex (10). Although required
for cap-dependent translation of all nuclear-encoded mRNAs,
increased eIF4F levels stimulate translation of mRNAs encoding
cancer-promoting proteins while having only a marginal effect on
translation of house-keeping mRNAs (11). Correspondingly,
elevated eIF4F activity has been linked to resistance to BRAF- and
MEK-targeted therapies (12). SBI-756 targeting of the eIF4G1
disrupts the eIF4F complex assembly, even in BRAFi-resistant

The emergence of effective inhibitors for BRAF-mutant melanoma has had major impact on the clinical management of
melanoma (1). However, the initial success of such treatments
has been limited due to the propensity of melanomas to develop
resistance (2). In most cases, mechanisms underlying BRAF
inhibitor (BRAFi) resistance include activation of genetic or
epigenetic pathways that circumvent targeted BRAF and restore
MAPK and related signaling to levels sufﬁcient to fuel tumorigenesis (2). This outcome has led to development of combination

BRAFi and inhibits NRAS- and NF1-mutant melanomas.

Materials and Methods
Western blot analysis and antibodies
Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed as previously described
(8). Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie
Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Equal amounts
of cell lysate proteins (50 mg) were separated on SDS-PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked (5% BSA/TBST, 1
hour) and incubated with primary antibodies (1 hour at room
temperate or overnight at 4 C), with shaking. Following three
TBST washes, membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature secondary antibodies (1:10,000). Detection and
quantiﬁcations were made using Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LiCor Biosciences), or by exposing them to X-ray
ﬁlm. Antibodies against p-AKT, p-PRAS40, p-IKK, p-IkB, p-TSC,
p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, p-RPS6, p-4E-BP1, pSGK3, AKT, PRAS40,
IKK, IkB, mTOR, p70S6K, RPS6, 4E-BP1, GSK3, eIF4G1, and
eIF4E were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against b-actin and a-tubulin were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies were goat
anti-rabbit Alexa-680 F(ab0 )2 (Molecular Probes) and goat
anti-mouse IRDye 800 F(ab0 )2 (Rockland Immunochemicals).
All antibodies were used according to the suppliers'
recommendations.
Cell culture
Melanoma lines were obtained from the Wistar Institute, Yale
University, TGen, NCI, and ATCC and maintained in high-glucose
Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium (HyClone) with 5% FBS and
1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37 C in 5% CO2. E1A/RAS transformed WT and 4E-BP double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were described previously (1). For cell line
authentication, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis was performed on isolated genomic DNA with the GenePrint 10 System
from Promega, and peaks were analyzed using GeneMarker HID
from Softgenetics. Allele calls were searched against STR databases
maintained by ATCC (www.atcc.org), DSMZ (www.dsmz.de),
Texas Tech University Children's Oncology Group (cogcell.org),
and the Wistar Institute Melanoma Cell STR Proﬁles (http://www.
wistar.org/lab/meenhard-herlyn-dvm-dsc/page/melanoma-cellstr-proﬁles). Authentication was last performed on August 24,
2015.
m7GTP pull-down assay
As previously described (13), cells growing in 100 mm plates
were washed (cold PBS), collected, and lysed in 50 mmol/L
MOPS/KOH (7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF, 2
mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 1% NP40, 1% Na-DOC, 7
mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were incubated with m7
-GDP-agarose beads (Jena Bioscience; 20 minutes), washed (4
times) with 50 mmol/L MOPS/KOH (7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 50
mmol/L NaF, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L EGTA, 7 mmol/L
b-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and
0.1 mmol/L GTP. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads
in loading buffer. m7-GDP-agarose pulled down material was
analyzed by Western blot analysis.

Results and Discussion
To improve the biophysical properties of BI-69A11, we
designed and synthesized over 60 BI-69A11 analogues (Fig.
1A). Following iterative structure–activity relationship (SAR), we
selected four analogies with improved pharmacokinetics (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1A). Of those, SBI-756 and SBI-726
exhibited superior properties (60 improved aqueous solubility
and up to 100 improved permeability), and a favorable pharmacokinetic proﬁle, while not exerting toxicity (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Examination of four human melanoma lines revealed that SBI756 and SBI-726 were comparable with BI-69A11 in their antiproliferative effects (Fig. 1B), and inhibition of AKT and NF-kB
activity (Fig. 1C). SBI-756 elicited comparable toxicity in melanoma cells and melanocytes, but was less toxic against nontransformed ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S1C). SBI-756 and SBI726 were more effective than BI-69A11 in attenuating colony
formation by BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma cells (Fig. 1D).
On the basis of its overall properties (in vivo and in vitro), we
selected to further characterize SBI-756.
To identify proteins that interact and may serve as direct targets
for SBI-756 we performed gas chromatography/liquid mass spectrometry (GC/MS-MS) using biotinylated BI-69A11. Of the 74
proteins that bound speciﬁcally (outcompeted using 10 excess
of soluble BI-69A11) was eIF4G1 (Supplementary Table S3). We
thus set to determine whether the eIF4F complex is indeed
disrupted by SBI-756, and further, whether the effect of SBI756 on AKT, NFkB, and mTOR are dispensable for its effect on
eIF4F as well as for suppression of melanoma growth.
We next determine whether SBI-756 dissociates eIF4G1 from
the eIF4F complex using m7GTP-agarose pull-down, which captures the eIF4F complex. SBI-756 effectively dissociated eIF4G1
from the eIF4E in a dose-dependent manner, which was accompanied by a concomitant increase in 4E-BP1:eIF4E binding
(Fig. 2A), reﬂective of impaired eIF4F complex formation. Inhibition of the eIF4F complex was also conﬁrmed for the parent
compound BI-69A11, although SBI-756 was more potent (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
SBI-756 also inhibits the AKT/mTORC1 signaling and
mTORC1 inhibition disrupts the eIF4F complex via activation of
4E-BPs (10). To determine whether SBI-756 impedes eIF4F assembly directly or via mTORC1, we employed 4E-BP1/2 DKO MEFs,
wherein mTOR inhibition does not impair the eIF4F assembly
(13). Whereas torin1 induced dissociation of eIF4G1 from eIF4E
in WT but not in 4E-BP DKO MEFs, SBI-756 reduced eIF4G1:eIF4E
association in both WT and 4E-BP DKO MEFs (Fig. 2B). Likewise,
SBI-756, but not torin1, attenuated the proliferation of E1A/RAS–
transformed 4E-BP DKO MEFs (Fig. 2C). These results substantiate that the effect of SBI-756 on the eIF4F complex assembly is
largely mTOR-independent.
As levels of the eIF4F complex inversely correlate with the
effectiveness of various cancer therapies (12, 14), we assessed the
integrity of the eIF4F complex after treating melanoma cells with a
combination of BRAFi vemurafenib (aka PLX4032) and SBI-756.
Comparing A375 melanoma cultures that are sensitive to BRAFi
and resistant derivatives (A375R), BRAFi slightly reduced eIF4G1
association with eIF4E, whereas SBI-756 had a more robust effect
(Fig. 2D). Signiﬁcantly, SBI-756, but not BRAFi, promoted a dosedependent dissociation of eIF4G1 from eIF4E in A375R (Fig. 2D),
Lu1205R and WM793R cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Further-

C, E1A/Ras-transformed WT or 4e-bp1/4e-bp2 DKO MEFs were treated with either Torin1 or SBI-756 at indicated concentrations and cell

(n ¼ 3). D, A375 and A375R (PLX4032-resistant) cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), a BRAFi (vemurafenib; PLX4032), or SBI-756 at the indicated

doses for 24 hours. Cell lysates (200 mg) were subjected to m GTP pull-down. Amounts of the indicated proteins in input (5%) or pull-down (50%) samples

were determined by Western blotting; b-actin served as a loading control (input) and to exclude contamination (m GTP pull-down).

more, a SBI-756/BRAFi combination decreased the amount of
eIF4G1 bound to eIF4E, which was not seen following BRAFi
treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). While consistent with a recent study reporting that compounds that target
eIF4E (such as 4EGI-1) or eIF4A (such as rocaglate derivatives)
synergize with BRAFi to inhibit proliferation of BRAFi-resistant
cells (12), our ﬁndings demonstrate the effectiveness of SBI-756 in
disrupting the eIF4F complex by targeting the eIF4G1.

To identify signaling pathways affected by SBI-756, we performed reverse-phase protein array analysis of BRAF- and NRASmutant melanomas (Supplementary Table S4). Unsupervised
clustering of proteins that signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) changed expression/phosphorylation levels with SBI-756 treatment for 24 hours
demonstrated a consistent inhibitory effect in both cell lines on
mTOR signaling, and multiple translation initiation regulators,

eIF4G1 Targeting in BRAF-Resistant and BRAF WT Melanoma

P70S6K as well as TSC2 (Supplementary Fig. S3A; Supplementary
Table S4). Of interest, SBI-756 did not affect MAPK or JAK–STAT
signaling pathways. Western blot analysis conﬁrmed the dosedependent inhibitory effects of SBI-756 on these proteins and a
decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in UACC903 and A375 cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
The effect of SBI-756 on mTOR, AKT, and NF-kB, led us to
determine whether modiﬁcation of SBI-756 could reduce its effect
on these signaling pathways while retaining its effect on the eIF4F
complex. Among SBI-756 derivatives, at least one (SBI-755199)
was found to be as effective in inducing melanoma cell death
(Fig. 3A) while exhibiting reduced inhibition of AKT, TSC2, PRS6,
and NFkB activity (Fig. 3B). Notably, SBI-755199 retained its
effective inhibition of mRNA translation (Fig. 3C). The latter was
performed using a bicistronic construct, which enables measuring
eIF4G1-dependent and eIF4G1-independent HCV-IRES–driven
translation. These data substantiate that the effects of SBI-756 on
the eIF4F complex underpin its biologic activity thereby providing
the basis for the SAR-based screen of SBI-756 analogues.
Dose–response analysis of SBI-756 in 21 melanoma lines
identiﬁed two groups representing respective SBI-756–sensitive
and -resistant lines (>2-fold expression difference in IC50 between
groups; Fig. 3D). Evaluation of gene expression data from these
cell lines enabled mapping differentially expressed genes (DEG)
for each group. In total, we detected 1,533 signiﬁcant DEGs
between sensitive and the more resistant cells (P < 0.05; fold
change > 1.5). Analysis of gene enrichment within canonical
pathways (Supplementary Table S5) identiﬁed higher expression
levels of genes involved in DNA damage response (P ¼ 4.1E 
109), ATM signaling (P ¼ 2.8  107), and CHK-mediated cellcycle checkpoint control (P ¼ 6.0  107) in SBI-756–resistant
cells, with concurrently lower expression of G2–M cell-cycle
checkpoint control genes (P ¼ 1.5  108). In addition, among
genes exhibiting lower expression in resistant lines were key cellcycle regulatory proteins, including, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and RB1
(P < 3.0  1014).
As genes conferring drug resistance can often reveal pathways
that underlie the drug's response, we established multiple SBI756–resistant clones from UACC903 and UACC3629 cultures.
Exome sequencing of individual clones identiﬁed a total of 587
protein-coding gene variants in 550 genes that were not
detected in the SBI-756–sensitive parental cultures (Supplementary Fig. S3C; Supplementary Table S6). Of these somatic
mutations, 88.1% (n ¼ 517) were missense or nonsense single
nucleotide variants, with the remaining 11.9% (n ¼ 70) consisting of splicing or frameshift mutations that alter reading
frames. IPA analysis indicated enrichment of numerous proteins (n ¼ 174) implicated in melanoma (P ¼ 3.8  1013).
Among genes with mutations identiﬁed in multiple SBI-756–
resistant clone, are those implicated in fatty-acid beta oxidation
(P ¼ 0.0008) and DNA damage response (P ¼ 0.004) and cellcycle checkpoint control (P ¼ 0.01; Supplementary Table S7).
These pathways were previously described to be affected upon
inhibition of the eIF4G pathway at the level of translation (15–
17). Consistent with these observations, a clear G2–M transition was identiﬁed following SBI-756 treatment in parental
(sensitive) but not in the SBI-756–resistant melanoma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3D).
To conﬁrm the effect of SBI-756 on the eIF4F complex in BRAFiresistant cultures on neoplastic growth, we assessed SBI-756
effectiveness on their two-dimensional (2D) growth in vitro (with

www.aacrjournals.org

BRAFi–PLX4032) and on tumorigenesis in vivo (with BRAFi–
PLX4720). Growth in 2D and colony-forming efﬁciency (CFE)
were effectively attenuated in both parental (sensitive) and resistant cultures, with NF1-mutant melanoma lines exhibiting equal
or greater sensitivity (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4A and
S4B). Effectiveness of SBI-756 in NF1-mutant melanoma was
further conﬁrmed in primary cultures (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
In vivo we ﬁrst evaluated SBI-756 using an inducible NrasQ61K/
Ink4a/ genetic model in which melanoma tumors emerge
within 16 to 20 weeks (Fig. 4B). Administration of SBI-756 only,
starting 11 weeks after genetic inactivation of Ink4a and induction
of NRasQ61E (about 10–14 days prior to tumor appearance),
delayed tumor onset (from 20–26 weeks), and reduced tumor
incidence, by 50%, compared with the control nontreated group
(Fig. 4B). No signs of toxicity were identiﬁed during and after
administration of SBI-756 (21-week period), consistent with
earlier studies with BI-69A11 (7). Given its effectiveness as a
single agent, one would expect that combination with MAPK
inhibitors could offer novel therapeutic modalities for Nrasmutant tumors.
In vivo, we monitored growth of A375 tumors in immunodeﬁcient mice subjected to either BRAFi alone or BRAFi combined
with SBI-756. Notably, SBI-756 did not elicit toxicity in mice,
which was monitored by liver function and body weight (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S1B). Growth of established tumors (250 mm3) was largely inhibited by treatment
with either BRAFi alone or a combination of BRAFi plus SBI-756
(Fig. 4C). However, as seen in human melanoma, tumors in the
BRAFi-treated group (3/5) resumed growth, whereas no tumors
were seen in mice (0/4) treated with the drug combination (Fig.
4C), suggesting that combining SBI-756 with BRAFi antagonizes
BRAFi-resistant melanoma in vivo. When we allowed tumors to
reach 500 mm3 before initiating treatment, 5 of 7 (75%) mice
subjected to BRAFi treatment alone relapsed as drug-resistant
tumors (4/5 within 4–6 weeks), whereas only 3 of 6 (50%)
subjected to combination treatment developed resistance, albeit
more slowly (2/3 after 8 weeks; Supplementary Fig. S4D). Notably, assessing SBI-756 effect on the eIF4F complex in vivo revealed
a time-dependent disruption of the eIF4F complex in melanoma
tumors grown in animals that were subjected to treatment with
both BRAFi and SBI-756 (up to 8 hours, consistent with the half
life of SBI-756; Fig. 4D). These results demonstrate the disruption
of the eIF4F complex in vivo, consistent with the effectiveness of
SBI-756 in overcoming BRAFi-resistant phenotype.
The ability of SBI-756 to elicit inhibition of the eIF4F complex independently of its effect on the mTOR/4E-BP pathway
highlights its distinct properties compared with currently available inhibitors to other components of the eIF4F complex such as
4EGI-1 (14). Furthermore, identiﬁcation of SBI-756 derivatives (i.
e., SBI-755199) that retain the effect on the eIF4F complex and on
melanoma cells while minimizing the effect on the mTOR/AKT/
NFkB substantiates eIF4F complex as the key target for the SBI-756
and its derivatives.
Although expression of the eIF4G1 protein has been reported to
be upregulated in tumors, including melanoma (Cancer Atlasand TCGA-based analyses) we expect that dysregulation of
eIF4G1 is not required for its support expression of cancerpromoting genes. Hence, dampening its overall effectiveness
along the translation initiation complex is expected to limit
oncogene expression and corresponding addiction, justifying its
targeting. The inability of vemurafenib to affect the eIF4F complex

eIF4G1 Targeting in BRAF-Resistant and BRAF WT Melanoma

Genetic support for the signiﬁcance of the eIF4F complex in
cancer was provided through the characterization of the haploinsufﬁcient eif4e mice, which were found to be more resistant to
tumor development (18). Correspondingly, efﬁcacy of a plethora
of inhibitors, including PI3K, mTOR, HER2, and MAPK, is limited

in the resistant melanoma, while SBI-756 retains its effectiveness,
underlies the novelty and importance of eIF4G1 targeting.
Signiﬁcantly, the low dose and the lack of in vivo toxicity observed
for SBI-756 makes it an even more attractive for further
evaluation.

in cells that exhibit high eIF4E–4E-BP ratio and correlates with
their inability to disrupt the eIF4F complex (14). Moreover, recent
ﬁndings show that the efﬁcacy of 4EGI-1, which is thought to
directly target eIF4E:eIF4G association is likely to be predetermined by the eIF4E-4E-BP ratio. As SBI-756 decreases eIF4F levels
independently of mTOR and cellular eIF4E–4E-BP ratio, its combination with currently available inhibitors is an appealing therapeutic modality that allows targeting the eIF4F complex independently of mTOR, eIF4E, or 4E-BP status in the cell.
