ABSTRACT
Diallyl disulfide (DADS) has been shown to have multi-targeted antitumor
activities. We have previously discovered that it has a repressive effect on LIM
kinase-1 (LIMK1) expression in gastric cancer MGC803 cells. This suggests that
DADS may inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by downregulating
LIMK1, resulting in the inhibition of invasion and growth in gastric cancer. In this
study, we reveal that LIMK1 expression is correlated with tumor differentiation,
invasion depth, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. DADS
downregulated the Rac1-Pak1/Rock1-LIMK1 pathway in MGC803 cells, as shown by
decreased p-LIMK1 and p-cofilin1 levels, and suppressed cell migration and invasion.
Knockdown and overexpression experiments performed in vitro demonstrated that
downregulating LIMK1 with DADS resulted in restrained EMT that was coupled with
decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and increased tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) expression. In in vitro and in vivo experiments, the
DADS-induced suppression of cell proliferation was enhanced and antagonized by the
knockdown and overexpression of LIMK1, respectively. Similar results were observed
for DADS-induced changes in the expression of vimentin, CD34, Ki-67, and E-cadherin
in xenografted tumors. These results indicate that downregulation of LIMK1 by DADS
could explain the inhibition of EMT, invasion and proliferation in gastric cancer cells.

We previously have reported that DADS induces
gastric cancer cell differentiation by downregulating
the ERK signaling pathway [3]. It induces G2/M
phase cell cycle arrest by activating p38 [4], increasing
histone H3 and H4 acetylation and p21WAF1 expression
[5], and suppressing the ATR/Chk1/Cdc25C/cyclinB1
signaling pathway by specifically activating Chk1 [6–7].
Moreover, DADS inhibits the Wnt-1 signaling pathway

INTRODUCTION
Diallyl disulfide (DADS), a major oil-soluble
compound derived from garlic, has multi-targeted
antitumor activities in diverse cancers that result in the
induction of cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest,
growth inhibition, differentiation, and apoptosis, by
interfering in a variety of cell signaling pathways [1–2].

by upregulating miR-200b and miR-22 in human gastric
cancer, which leads to the apoptosis and the inhibition of
proliferation [8].
DADS restrains migration and invasion in
cancer cells, including the gastric cancer AGS cell
line, by inhibiting the expression and activity of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) [9–11]. However, the
mechanisms underlying its potential anti-gastric tumor
metastasis activities remain to be determined. A recent
study has revealed that DADS induces the reversal of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibits
growth by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway in
breast cancer cells [12].
We have previously demonstrated that the DADSinduced downregulation of uPAR (urokinase-type
plasminogen activator receptor) results in the inhibition
of the ERK/Fra-1 pathway in addition to gastric cancer
cell migration and invasion. DADS downregulates LIM
kinase-1 (LIMK1), vimentin and MMP-9 expression and
upregulates E-cadherin and TIMP-3 (tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-3) expression, suggesting that DADS
may reverse EMT by downregulating LIMK1 [13]. In
addition, we have found that the increased expression
of Rac1, Pak1 and Rock1 in primary gastric cancer is
correlated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and
poor prognosis [14].
LIMK1 is involved in cell proliferation and invasion
[15]. It is primarily activated by Pak, Rock and MRCK,
which are downstream effectors of the Rho family of
small GTPases. Among these, Rac1, Rho, and Cdc42
are considered to be major players during EMT [16].
The substrates of LIMK1 are members of the cofilin/
ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor, also known as
destrin) family, which maintain actin polymerization
and depolymerization dynamics through their F-actinsevering activities. Inactivating cofilin/ADF by LIMK1
via phosphorylation results in the formation of membrane
protrusions, which facilitates cancer cell migration and
invasion [15, 17]. LIMK1 and its upstream signaling
factors could be valuable targets for anti-cancer metastasis
therapies [18]. DADS inhibits migration and invasion by
attenuating the Rac1-Rock1/Pak1-LIMK1 pathway in
colon cancer cells [19]. We therefore hypothesized that
LIMK1 might be involved in DADS-induced inhibition
of EMT, invasion and proliferation in gastric cancer cells.
In this study, we demonstrate that increased LIMK1
expression is associated with gastric tumor differentiation,
tumor size, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and
poor prognosis. DADS decreased Rac1, Pak1 and Rock1

expression. Overexpression and knockdown experiments
performed in vitro revealed that DADS inhibited migration
and invasion by reducing LIMK1 expression and activity.
These effects may be due to the suppression of EMT,
the downregulation of MMP-9 and the upregulation of
TIMP-3. Downregulation of LIMK1 by DADS causes
suppression of cell growth in in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
DADS inhibits EMT, invasion and proliferation by
downregulating LIMK1 in gastric cancer cells.

RESULTS
LIMK1 is upregulated in primary gastric cancer
To determine the relationship between LIMK1
expression and gastric cancer, LIMK1 levels were
detected in 64 cases of normal stomach mucosa and 140
cases of gastric cancer tissues using IHC analysis of
tissue arrays. LIMK1 expression scores greater than or
less than 2 were used to divide normal and tumor tissue
specimens into high-expression and low-expression
groups. Out of 64 normal stomach samples, 15 (23.4%)
showed high expression levels of LIMK1. In contrast,
approximately 63.6% (P < 0.001, 89 of 140 patients) of
tumors exhibited increased LIMK1 expression (Table 1).
These data indicated that LIMK1 expression levels were
significantly elevated in primary gastric cancer tissues
compared with normal tissues. In addition, we observed
that LIMK1 expression was upregulated in paraneoplastic
mucosa and gastric tumors with different differentiation
degrees (Figure 1A), suggesting that high LIMK1
expression levels may contribute to carcinogenesis,
clinical progression and differentiation in gastric tumors.

Increased levels of LIMK1 are correlated with
tumor differentiation, invasion depth, advanced
clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor
prognosis
The correlations between altered LIMK1 expression
and clinicopathological parameters were assessed to
determine potential clinicopathologic implications. As
shown in Table 2, LIMK1 expression levels exhibited no
significant correlation with either gender or age, but they
were positively correlated with tumor differentiation (P
= 0.001), invasion depth (P = 0.006), clinical stage (P =
0.011) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009). To further
evaluate the significance of LIMK1 expression in terms of
clinical prognosis, a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was

performed using patient overall survival (OS). The results
showed that patients with high LIMK1 expression had
fewer mean months of OS than patients with low LIMK1
expression (P < 0.0001 for OS, Figure 1B). Likewise, the
median survival time was shorter in the high LIMK1 level
group (21 months) than in the low LIMK1 level group
(33 months). These results indicate that elevated LIMK1
levels are associated with tumor differentiation, tumor
size, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, andprognosis
in patients with gastric cancer.

30 mg/L DADS for 12, 24, and 48 h in a time-dependent
manner, as was LIMK1 downregulation. In addition,
p-cofilin1, a downstream effector of LIMK1, decreased
accordingly, but there was no change in the level of total
cofilin1. Intriguingly, we found that DADS downregulated
p-LIMK1 and p-cofilin1 levels after 6 h incubation, which
is sooner than the decrease observed in LIMK1 levels (12
h). These data indicate that DADS reduced both the total
protein level of LIMK1 and its phosphorylation, which
may have resulted in the decreased phosphorylation of
cofilin1. The downregulation of LIMK1, p-LIMK1 and
p-cofilin1 may contribute to DADS-induced inhibition of
MGC803 cell migration and invasion.

DADS is concomitant with the inhibition of

line MGC803. These results were consistent with our
previously reported data [11]. As shown in Figure 2C,

protein expression was significantly downregulated after
24 h. The level of Rock1 transcripts was decreased at 12 h,
and a clear decrease in its protein level began at 24 h. The
mRNA and protein levels of Pak1 were clearly reduced
after 24 h of incubation. These data indicate that DADS
treatment decreased the expression of Rac1, Rock1 and
Pak1, which may also account for the downregulation
of p-LIMK1 and p-cofilin1. In addition, we detected the
expression of destrin, a downstream effector of LIMK1.
No significant difference in its mRNA and protein levels
were observed after DADS treatment compared to its
levels in the controls. These data suggest that decreased
p-LIMK1 and p-cofilin1 levels may result from the
downregulation of Rac1, Rock1, Pak1 and LIMK1
expression that was induced by DADS.

migration and invasion, we used microRNAs to interfere
with LIMK1 protein expression. Based on the results
of western blot analysis, the stable LIMK1-interfering
cell line that demonstrated the best knockdown efficacy,
here referred to as miR3, was chosen for the following
experiments (Figure 4A). In contrast to the empty vector
group, p-cofilin1, p-LIMK1 and LIMK1 levels were
attenuated in the LIMK1-miRgroup (Figure 4B). Similar
results were observed in cells exposed to 30 mg/L DADS
for 24 h compared to untreated controls, whether we
used MGC803 or the empty vector group. Moreover,
DADS augmented the effects of LIMK1-miR on cells
(Figure 4B). Accordingly, both the migration and the
invasion rates observed in LIMK1-miR-expressing cells
were significantly reduced compared to the empty vector
group (Figure 4C and 4D). DADS had the same effects
on MGC803 and the empty vector group. In addition, the
DADS + LIMK1-miR group showed a stronger inhibitory
effect than the DADS or LIMK1-miR group (Figure 4C
and 4D). These data indicate that DADS inhibited cell
migration and invasion by suppressing the phosphorylation
of cofilin1, which resulted from suppression of LIMK1
expression and activity.

Overexpression of LIMK1 attenuates the
inhibitory effects of DADS on MGC803 cell
migration and invasion

DADS inhibits EMT by downregulating LIMK1
in MGC803 cells
Vimentin and E-cadherin protein levels were
decreased and increased, respectively, by 30 mg/L DADS
in a time-dependent manner (Figure 6A). These data
suggest that DADS inhibits EMT in gastric cancer cells,
which may explain its suppressive effects on MGC803
cell migration and invasion. To further determine whether
LIMK1 is involved in the DADS-triggered inhibition of
EMT in MGC803 cells, we explored the effects of both
the knockdown and overexpression of LIMK1 on EMT in
DADS-treated and -untreated cells. LIMK1 knockdown
led to the upregulation of E-cadherin and TIMP-3 and the
downregulation of vimentin and MMP-9. These effects
were similar to those observed in cells treated with DADS
alone, and they were enhanced in DADS-treated cells
compared with untreated MGC803 cells (Figure 6B).
LIMK1 overexpression therefore neutralized the effects
of DADS (Figure 6C).
We then assessed changes in cell morphology. In
the MGC803 group, many cells had a typical spindleshape morphology and demonstrated a reduction in
cell-cell junctions. In contrast, many cells grew in
clusters with well-defined junctions and exhibited an

To determine whether overexpressing LIMK1 has
an antagonistic effect on DADS-induced inhibition of
cell migration and invasion, we constructed a LIMK1overexpressing MGC803 cell line (Figure 5A) that showed
increased p-LIMK1 and p-cofilin1 levels compared to the
empty vector group or the MGC803 group. After treatment
with 30 mg/L DADS for 24 h, the levels of p-LIMK1 and
p-cofilin1 in LIMK1-overexpressing cells were clearly
reduced but were equivalent to the levels in the DADSuntreated cells (Figure 5B). In contrast, DADS-treated
cells showed a stronger suppression of the phosphorylation
of LIMK1 and cofilin1 in the empty vector group than in
the LIMK1-overexpressing group (Figure 5B). Similarly,
LIMK1 overexpression markedly increased cell activities,
including migration and invasion, compared with the
controls and neutralized the inhibitory effect of DADS on
cell migration and invasion (Figure 5C and 5D). These
results demonstrated that the overexpression of LIMK1
antagonized the DADS-induced downregulation of
LIMK1 and p-LIMK1 and inhibition of cell migration and
invasion.

and the LIMK1-miR group. However, the majority of
cells in the LIMK1-overexpressing group demonstrated
mesenchymal cell morphology and almost no cellcell junctions. In addition, LIMK1 overexpression
antagonized the DADS-induced changes in cell
morphology. These data collectively indicate that LIMK1
is required for EMT in MGC803 cells and that the
downregulation of LIMK1 by DADS slowed EMT.

the MGC803 group. Cell proliferation was decreased in
the DADS and LIMK1 knockdown groups compared to
the control groups. The effects of DADS were augmented
by knockdown of LIMK1, whereas these effects were
attenuated by overexpression of LIMK1. As shown in
Figure 7B, flow cytometry analysis revealed that 37.1% of
the cells were arrested in G2/M phase in the DADS groups
compared to 16.4% in the MGC803 group. In the LIMK1
knockdown group, the percentage of G2/M phase cells
was increased to 47.6% compared to 17.3% in the negative
control group. Moreover, the proportion of G2/M cells
was increased by DADS treatment in the LIMK1-miR +
DADS group (59.3%). In contrast, LIMK1 overexpression
reduced the proportion of G2/M cells (6.1%) compared to
the empty vector group (16.8%). DADS arrested 14.3%
cells in G2/M phase in the LIMK1 + DADS group.

Effects of LIMK1 knockdown and
overexpression on DADS-induced growth

We performed in vitro experiments to explore the
biological effect of LIMK1 on MGC803 cell growth
and to determine whether there is an association
between DADS antiproliferative effects and LIMK1
expression. Cell proliferation was assessed in vitro after
untransfected, LIMK1-miR-expressing and LIMK1overexpressing MGC803 cells were treated with 30 mg/
DADS or left untreated for different periods of time. As
shown in Figure 7A, the empty vector groups showed no
significant change in cell proliferation compared to that of

6 days. According to Figure 7C, compared to the MGC803
control group, the DADS and LIMK1-miR groups
exhibited a detectable reduction in tumor volume, whereas
an increased tumor volume was observed in the LIMK1overexpressing group. Furthermore, mice treated with
LIMK1 + DADS or LIMK1-miR exhibited reduced or
increased tumor volumes, respectively, in contrast to those
treated with DADS alone. After 48 days, the xenografts
were removed. The same changes were observed in tumor
volume and weight (Figure 7D and 7E). These in vitro and
in vivo data indicate that LIMK1 may promote the G2/M
transition in MGC803 cells, and the downregulation of
LIMK1 could therefore explain DADS-induced cell cycle
arrest in G2/M phase, which results in the inhibition of
cell proliferation.

Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the
protein expression levels of vimentin, CD34, Ki-67

proliferation. As shown in Figure 8, vimentin, CD34,
and Ki-67 expression levels were downregulated by
DADS and LIMK1-miR. LIMK1-miR potentiated the
inhibitory effect of DADS on the expression of these
markers. LIMK1 overexpression, which increased their
expression, attenuated the inhibitory effects of DADS on
their expression. The downregulation of E-cadherin has

of DADS on the Rac1-Pak1/Rock1-LIMK1 signaling
pathway, focusing on whether the downregulation of
LIMK1 is associated with DADS-induced inhibition of
EMT, invasion and proliferation.
The inhibition of either the expression or the
activity of Rac1 [20–21], Pak1 [22–23] or Rock1 [24–25]
leads to the suppression of tumor cell growth, invasion
and metastasis. We found that the expression levels of
Rac1, Pak1, and Rock1 were reduced by treatment with
DADS in MGC803 cells. Recent studies have shown that
inhibiting Rac1 activity [26] or knocking down LIMK1
expression [27] abrogated their effects on malignant
phenotypes, including increased growth and invasion
in gastric cancer cells. Thus, the downregulation of the
Rac1-Pak1/Rock1 pathway by DADS may result in the
suppression of LIMK1 activation and thereby decrease
cell growth and invasion.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we first confirmed that LIMK1 is
upregulated in primary gastric cancer and that a higher
level of LIMK1 expression is correlated with tumor
differentiation, tumor size, advanced clinical stage, lymph
node metastasis, and poor prognosis, suggesting that
LIMK1 may contribute to carcinogenesis and the clinical
progression of gastric cancer. We next explored the effects

LIMK is required for the formation of invadapodia,
which are involved in MMP-mediated extracellular matrix
degradation during tumor cell invasion [17]. LIMK is
primarily engaged in modulating cofilin/ADF activity
[28–29]. Cofilin/ADF and LIMK1 are concurrently
overexpressed and overactivated in invading cells in vitro
and in metastatic cells in vivo in diverse tumors that are
associated with invasion, intravasation and metastasis [30–
31]. Although we observed no alteration in cofilin1 and
destrin expression levels, the downregulation of p-cofilin1
by DADS occurred concomitantly with a decrease in
LIMK1 and p-LIMK1 levels, and these changes were
consistent with the reduced rates of cell migration and
invasion.
Interestingly, we found that a decrease in p-LIMK1
occurred earlier than the decreases in LIMK1 and its
upstream modulators (Rac1, Pak1, and Rock1) after
cells were incubated with DADS. This indicates that the
reduced levels of p-LIMK1 may be the result of DADS
inhibiting its activation via other mechanisms in addition
to decreasing Rac1, Pak1, Rock1 and LIMK1 expression.
Inactivation of cofilin by LIMK1 is required for
local F-actin stability and the formation and maturation
of functional invadopodia [17]. Because knockdown
of LIMK1 or cofilin1 expression decreases cancer cell
motility and invasion [16, 31, 32], we proposed that cofilin
phosphorylation resulting from LIMK1 overexpression
and overactivation may lead to cell migration and invasion
in gastric cancer cells. This assumption was verified by the
results of in vitro experiments that DADS inhibited cofilin
phosphorylation and that cell migration and invasion
were attenuated and augmented by overexpression
and knockdown of LIMK1, respectively. Thus, DADS
suppresses the LIMK1-cofilin1 pathway, resulting in the

DADS-induced inhibition of migration and invasion in
gastric cancer cells.
The
Rac1-Pak1-LIMK1-cofilin1
pathway
is involved in EMT [33–35]. We have previously
demonstrated that DADS increased E-cadherin and
TIMP-3 (an inhibitor of MMPs) expression and decreased
vimentin and MMP-9 expression in MGC803 cells in vitro.
We therefore have proposed that DADS may suppress
migration and invasion by inhibiting EMT [13]. In this
study, we verified that DADS and LIMK1 knockdown
induced changes in cell morphology in vitro, and we
showed that this had the same effects on the expression of
vimentin, E-cadherin, MMP-9 and TIMP-3. The changes
in the expression of these proteins that were induced by
DADS were antagonized by LIMK1 overexpression.
Furthermore, the effects of LIMK1 overexpression and
knockdown on DADS-induced vimentin and E-cadherin
expression were supported by the results from in vivo
experiments. Therefore, LIMK1 promotes EMT in gastric
cancer cells, and this process can be reversed by DADS.
High vimentin expression and low E-cadherin
expression are observed in various epithelial cancers,
including gastric cancer, and are correlated with EMT,
tumor growth, invasion, and poor prognosis [36–37].
Overexpression of LIMK1 accelerates the activation of
ERK [15], which increases vimentin [38] and decreases
E-cadherin [39], and the LIMK1/cofilin1 pathway is
involved in EMT [35]. We reported that DADS inhibited
the ERK/Fra-1 pathway, increased E-cadherin expression
and decreased vimentin expression in MGC803 cells
in vitro [13]. Thus, the effects of DADS on E-cadherin
and vimentin expression may result from the blocking
of the ERK/Fra-1 pathway by the inhibition of LIMK1
expression and activity.

the subcutis of nude mice. The mice were treated with normal saline or DADS via intraperitoneal injection every 2 days. The xenografts
were collected at 48 days. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of vimentin, CD34, Ki-67 and E-cadherin in the
tumor tissue specimens obtained from the xenografts. A representative tissue section is shown for each group (×400 magnification).

Clinical samples

In in vitro experiments, we observed that LIMK1
overexpression promoted the G2/M transition and cell
proliferation and blocked the DADS-induced inhibition
of proliferation, whereas knockdown of LIMK1 exhibited
effects similar to those of DADS. Moreover, the effect of
LIMK1 knockdown and overexpression on the DADSinduced inhibition of tumor growth were confirmed in
in vivo experiments. LIMK knockdown causes cells to
accumulate in G2/M phase [40–41]. Thus, these results
reveal that the downregulation of LIMK1 by DADS
results in G2/M phase arrest and therefore the inhibition
of cell proliferation.
Ki-67 [42] and CD34 [43] are markers of cell
proliferation and angiogenesis, respectively, in tumors.
Pak1, an upstream activator of LIMK1, is associated
with the expression of CD34 [43] and Ki-67 [44].
We demonstrated that overexpression of LIMK1
increased Ki-67 and CD34 expression in xenografted
tumors. DADS treatment and the knockdown of
LIMK1 expression had opposite effects. Therefore, the
downregulation of LIMK1 may result in DADS-induced
changes in the expression of these proteins and inhibit
proliferation in gastric cancer.
In summary, we confirmed that DADS reduces the
expression of Rac1, Pak1 and Rock1 in gastric cancer
MGC803 cells. Moreover, DADS inhibits EMT, invasion
and proliferation by downregulating LIMK1. These effects
are associated with the decreased expression of vimentin,
MMP-9, CD34, and Ki-67 and the increased expression
of E-cadherin and TIMP-3. Therefore, downregulation of
LIMK1 may explain, in part, the mechanisms by which
DADS inhibits EMT, invasion and proliferation in gastric
tumor cells.

All tissue samples used in the present study were
collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, University of
South China (Hengyang, Hunan, China). Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient. The collection
and use of tissues followed the procedures according
to the ethical standards as formulated in the Helsinki
Declaration. This study was approved by the research
ethics committee of University of South China.
The tissue microarrays, including 140 cases of
gastric cancer and 64 cases of normal stomach mucosa,
were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. All
data, including age, sex, histologic grade, tumor size, and
lymph node metastasis were obtained from clinical and
pathologic records.

Analysis of LIMK1 expression in gastric cancer
IHC was performed to detect LIMK1 expression in
normal stomach mucosa and gastric cancer. The expression
levels of LIMK1 were evaluated independently by three
pathologists who were blinded to the patient’s clinical
data. The intensities of positive staining were scored by
0-4, according to the standards of 0-1 (no staining), 1-2
(weak staining), 2-3 (medium staining), and 3-4 (strong
staining). The percentages of positive stained cells were
analyzed. Those expression scores equaled to scores of
the intensities × the percentages of positive cells. Those
expression scores of ≥ 2 was defined as high expression, <
2 was considered as low expression.

Cell culture and cell line establishment
Human gastric cancer MGC803 cell line was
obtained from the Cancer Research Institute, Xiangya
Medical College, Central South University in China. Cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Life Technologies, Vienna,
Austria) with the addition of 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/
mL streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of containing 5% CO2. To establish the

blots were blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room
temperature, and then incubated with the primary antibody
at 4°C overnight. The membranes were washed in TBS-T
and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000-1:2000). After
washed with TBS-T, the membranes were developed
by an enhanced chemiluminescence plus (ECL Plus) kit
(Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England)
and bands were visualized on X-ray film (Kodak).
Membranes were re-incubated with anti-β-actin antibody
to verify equal protein-sample loading. The target protein
amounts were normalized towards β-actin quantity using
densitometry, then relative fold changes in protein levels
were calculated as ratios between treated versus control
group values.

Cell migration and invasion assays

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Cell migration and invasion assays were performed
as previously described [13]. For the cell migration
assays, an artificial “wound” was created after transfected
and untransfected MGC803 cells were cultured to 90%
confluence. Cells were left untreated or were treated with
DADS at the indicated concentrations for 24 h, and the
wound areas were then photographed using an inverted
microscope. The migration distance was measured, and
migration rates are expressed as the ratio of the treated
group value to the control group value. Invasion assays
were performed using Transwell® plates (Corning,
Corning, NY). Briefly, MGC803 cells were seeded onto
Matrigel-coated filters. Transfected and untransfected
cells were treated with indicated concentrations of DADS
for 24 h or left untreated. The cells that had invaded the
lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with
hematoxylin. Invasion rates are expressed as the ratio of
the treated group value to the control group value.

After cells were untreated or treated with DADS
(Fluka Co, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), total RNA
was extracted from the cells using Trizol reagent (Gibco
BRL, Grand Island, USA). Reverse transcription was
carried out using the RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison,
USA). PCR analysis was performed using the Gene amp
PCR kit (Promega). Primer sequence for Rac1 forward:

determined using the Labwork analysis software. The
relative abundance was expressed as the ratio of the object
gene to β-actin.

Cell proliferation assays and cell cycle analysis
Cell proliferation assays were performed using a
CellTiter 96 AQ One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
kit (MTS, Promega, Madison, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded in 96well plates at 1 × 104 cells per well. Transfected and
untransfected cells were treated with 30 mg/L DADS for
the indicated times or left untreated, and the absorbance
was recorded at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Each
assay was replicated 5 times.
Cell cycle analyses were conducted as follows.
Briefly, transfected and untransfected cells were treated
with 30 mg/L DADS for 24 h or left untreated. Cells were
harvested and resuspended in ice-cold 75% ethanol and
then fixed for 24 h at 4 °C. For subsequent flow cytometry
analysis, fixed cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PI

Western blot analysis
For total protein extraction, cells lysed directly on
ice for 30 min in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.6), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0), 100
μg/mL PMSF and 1 μg/mL aprotinin]. The cell lysates
were centrifugated at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and the
supernatants were collected. Then protein contents
were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA).
Protein extracts were loaded on a 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and transferred

Gastric tumor growth in nude mice
Untransfected or transfected MGC803 cells were
injected into the subcutis of the right axillary of male
athymic BALB/c nude mice (4 weeks old). The mice
were treated with normal saline or 100 mg/kg DADS
via intraperitoneal injection every 2 days until the
termination of the experiment. Tumor volume (cm3) was
examined every 6 days and calculated using a standard
formula (width2 × length × 0.5). Average tumor volumes
are presented (n=5 for each group) starting from the
twelfth day and continuing until sacrifice at 48 days. The
xenografts were removed, and tumor size and weight
were measured at 48 days. Tumor tissues were then fixed
in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5
μm-thick) were prepared for subsequent IHC analysis. All
experiments were performed according to the guidelines
for animal use of the Ethics Committee of University of

Briefly, after slides were dewaxed in xylene and
hydrated in graded alcohol solutions, antigen retrieval
was performed by heat treatment in 10 mM sodium
citrate buffer (pH 8.0). Slides were incubated in 3% H2O2
solution to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and
then incubated with normal goat serum for 20 min. Slides
were incubated with primary antibodies (dilution 1:100)
at 4 °C overnight. Positive signals were developed with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and 0.5%
diaminobenzidine/H2O2 followed by counterstaining
with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydration, clearing, and
mounting. The slides that were treated with normal goat
serum were evaluated as negative controls.
