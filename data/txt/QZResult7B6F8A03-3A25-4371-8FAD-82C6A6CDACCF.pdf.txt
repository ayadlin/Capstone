It is prevailingly thought that estrogen signaling is not involved in development of estrogen
receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer. However, there is evidence indicating that ovariectomy
prevents the development of both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer, suggesting that
estrogen signaling is involved in the development of ER-negative breast cancer. Previously, our
laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36 mediated non-genomic
estrogen signaling and is highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we
found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in 10/12 cases of triple-negative breast cancer. We
investigated the role of mitogenic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in malignant growth of
triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of
ER-α36 and found these cells were strongly responded to mitogenic estrogen signaling both in
vitro and in vivo. Knock-down of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the shRNA method
diminished their responsiveness to estrogen. ER-α36 physically interacted with the EGFR/Src/Shc
complex and mediated estrogen-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and Src. EGFR signaling
activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter and ER-α36
expression was able to stabilize EGFR protein. Our results thus demonstrated that ER-α36
mediates non-genomic estrogen signaling through the EGFR/Src/ERK signaling pathway in ERnegative breast cancer cells and suggested that a subset of ER-negative breast tumors that express
ER-α36 retain responsiveness to mitogenic estrogen signaling.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

ER-negative breast cancer constitutes approximately 30% of all breast cancers and generally
is more aggressive than ER-positive breast cancer (Lacroix et al., 2004; Simpson et al.,
2005). Because of the lack of ER-α expression, it is prevailingly thought that estrogen
signaling is not involved in development and progression of ER-negative breast cancer.
However, several early reports showed that ovariectomy prevents formation of both ERpositive and –negative breast cancers (Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group,
1992; Nissen-Meyer, 1964). Interestingly, BRCA1 mutation related breast tumors, the vast
majority of which are ER-negative, are also effectively prevented by prophylactic
ovariectomy (Narod, 2001; Rebbeck et al., 1999). These observations suggested that ovarian
hormones contribute to development of ER-negative breast cancers. Previously, it was
reported that estrogen activates the PI3K/AKT phosphorylation in ER-negative breast cancer
cells (Tsai et al., 2001). Estrogen treatment was reported to stimulate malignant growth of
ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in immuno-deficient mice (Friedl and
Jordan, 1994). These results suggested that some ER-negative breast cancer cell lines may
retain non-genomic and mitogenic estrogen signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying these observations are largely unknown.

Author Manuscript

Previously, we identified and cloned a 36-kDa variant of ER-α, ER-α36, which is mainly
expressed on the plasma membrane and mediates non-genomic estrogenic signaling (Wang
et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006). ER-α36 lacks both transcription activation domains AF-1
and AF-2 of the 66-kDa full-length ER-α (ER-α66), and possesses an altered ligand-binding
domain and an intact DNA-binding domain, consistent with the fact that ER-α36 has no
intrinsic transcriptional activity but mediates non-genomic estrogen signaling (Wang et al.,
2006). ER-α36 is generated from a promoter located in the first intron of the ER-α66 gene
(Zou et al., 2009), indicating that ER-α36 expression is regulated differently from ER-α66,
consistent with the findings that ER-α36 is expressed in specimens from ER-negative
patients and established ER-negative breast cancer cells that lack ER-α66 expression (Lee et
al., 2008; Shi et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2006).

Author Manuscript

We have investigated the contribution of non-genomic estrogen signaling mediated by ERα36 to malignant growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate the
existence of a positive feedback loop between ER-α36 and EGFR expression and a crosstalk
between non-genomic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 and the EGFR/Src/ERK
signaling pathway that promotes malignant growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells.

obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All parental and
derivative cells were maintained in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator. For E2β treatment, cells were maintained in phenol red-free media with 2.5%
charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) for three days, and then in serumfree medium for 24 hours before experimentation. To test the effects of different inhibitors,

Establishment of Stable Cell Lines

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells with ER-α36 expression knocked down by the
shRNA method were established as described before (Kang et al., 2010). MDA-MB-231
cells transfected with the empty expression vector, an control vector expressing shRNA for
luciferase or two different ER-α36 specific shRNA expression vector were named as 231/V,
231/lucSh, 231/Sh36(3-1) and 231/Sh36(1-7), respectively. For MDA-MB-436 cells, cells
transfected with the empty expression vector or the ER-α36 shRNA expression vector were
selected for three weeks, and more than 20 clones of selected cells were pooled and named
as 436/V and 436/Sh36, respectively.
siRNA Transfection

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at 2 X 105 cells/dish in 60 mm culture dishes 24 hours
before transfection. One μg of ER-β or control siRNA was mixed with siRNA transfetion
medium and siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotech., Santa Cruz, CA) and
incubated for 30 min. at room temperature before added into cultured cells. The efficiency
of siRNA knock-down was assessed with Western blot analysis.
RNA purification and RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was prepared with the “TRIzol” RNA purification reagent. One μg of total RNA
was reversely transcribed using the ProtoScript II RT-PCR kit (New England Biolab.,
Ipswich, MA). RT-PCR analysis of ER-α36, EGFR and β-actin was performed using gene
specific primers as the following. ER-α36: forward primer: 5′CAAGTGGTTTCCTCGTGTCTAAAG-3′; reverse primer: 5′TGTTGAGTGTTGGTTGCCAGG-3′; EGFR: forward primer: 5′CGTCCGCAAGTGTAAGAA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-AGCAAAAACCCTGTGATT-3′; βactin: forward primer: 5′-TGACGGGGT CACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′; reverse
primer: 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGA GGG-3′. PCR procedure was
carried out as described before (Zou et al., 2009). PCR products were analyzed by
electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under UV
illumination.
DNA mutagenesis

Author Manuscript

To mutate the AP1 consensus binding site from 5′-AGAGTCA-3′ to 5′-AGctTCA-3′, the
mutated primers ER-α36P-AP1m forward: 5′GCAGCCCGCGCTGCGTTCAGctTCAAGTTCTCTCGCCGGG-3′, and reverse: 5′CCCGGCGAGAGAACTTGAagCTGAACGCAGCGCGGGCTGC-3′ were used. The
mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The mutation was
verified by DNA sequencing.

expression vector or the expression vector for EGFR (a kind gift from Dr. Laura Hansen at
Creighton University). Cells were co-transfected with a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla
luciferase plasmid, pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) to establish transfection efficiency.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle, 10 μM of U0126, PP2,
or LY294002 for twenty-four hours. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell extracts were
prepared and luciferase activities were determined and normalized using the DualLuciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis

Author Manuscript

For imunoprecipitation assays, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with
the lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% NP-40) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cell lysates were then
incubated with indicated primary antibodies, or pre-immune serum and immunoprecipitated
with protein A/G plus agarose. The precipitates were then washed, separated on SDS-PAGE
and analyzed with Western blot analysis as described before (Kang et al., 2010).
Tumor formation in nude mice

Author Manuscript

Tumor formation was assayed using ovariectomized female nude mice (5–6 weeks old,
strain CDI nu/nu, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Wilmington, MA). ERnegative breast cancer cells maintained in phenol red-free media with 2.5% charcoalstripped fetal calf serum for three days were washed with 0.025% edetate sodium (Versene
Dow, Midland, MI) and 0.05% trypsin in a Ca2+-and Mg2+-free PBS before inoculation. For
MDA-MB-231 cells, a total of 1 X 106 cells for each clone were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of
PBS and inoculated subcutaneously into the mammary fatpad of ovariectomized female
nude mice 5 days after subcutaneous implantation of 1.7 mg/60-day release E2 (treated; 12
mice) or placebo (control; 12 mice) pellets (Innovative Research of American, Sarasota,
FL). Tumor growth was monitored by measuring two perpendicular diameters with vernier
calipers. For MDA-MB-436 cells, 1 X 106 cells for each cell line were re-suspended in 0.1
ml Matrixgel™ Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and
inoculated into the fatpad of ovariectomized female nude mice. The estrogen and placebo
pellets were replaced after 60 days. Tumor growth was measured weekly. Tumor volume
based on caliper measurements were calculated by the formula: Tumor volume = 1/2(length
× width2).

expression, predominantly in a cytoplasmic and membranous pattern (Supplement Figure 1).
The mean percentage of the ER-α36-positive cells was 53% and the majority of the cases
showed weak to moderate ER-α36 staining. EGFR expression was detected in six cases,
four of which co-expressed ER-α36. These results suggested that a subset of triple-negative
breast cancer that lacks expression of the full-length ER-α (ER-α66) but expresses a variant
of ER-α66, ER-α36.
To determine if established triple-negative breast cancer cells that express ER-α36 retain
non-genomic estrogen signaling, we used breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436
cells, both of which are triple-negative. Western blot analysis showed that both ER-α36 and
EGFR are highly expressed in these breast cancer cells while ER-positive MCF7 cells
expressed high levels of ER-α66 but lower levels of ER-α36 and EGFR (Figure 1A).

To determine whether 17β-estradiol (E2β) induced phosphorylation of the MAPK/ERK1/2, a
typical non-genomic estrogen-signaling event, in these two cell lines, we treated cells with
E2β at different concentrations and for different time periods. Western blot analysis with a
phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody was performed. Figure 1B shows that E2β elicited ERK
phosphorylation in both cell lines in a dos-dependent manner starting at a extreme low
concentration, 1 X 10−16 M/L. Time course analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that
ERK phosphorylation occurred within 5 min after E2β application, peaked at 15 min,
declined at 30 min and then exhibited another more sustained activation at 60 min.
However, this double-peak induction pattern of the MAPK/ERK was not obvious in MDAMB-436 cells (Figure 1B). Consequently, E2β was also able to induce expression of the
growth-promoting genes c-Myc and cyclin D1 in both cell lines (Figure 1C). These results
demonstrated that these triple-negative breast cancer cells retained non-genomic estrogen
signaling.
We then decided to determine if estrogen stimulates proliferation of these triple-negative
breast cancer cells. Since these triple-negative breast cancer cells express high levels of
EGFR, which makes these cells proliferate at a near-maximal rate in serum-supplemented
medium, the stimulating effects of estrogen-signaling on proliferation of these cells are most
time too subtle to detect in vitro in the presence of 10-5% fetal calf serum (Friedl and
Jordan, 1994; Rai et al., 2005). To alleviate this problem, we devised a new strategy by
reducing charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum concentration from 10% to 2.5% and increased
estrogen treatment time to 12 days. As shown in Figure 1D, the cells treated with E2β
exhibited a significantly increased growth rate compared with cells treated with vehicle
(Figure 1D). Our data thus demonstrated that mitogenic estrogen signaling stimulates
proliferation of these ER-negative breast cancer cells.

ER-α36 mediates mitogenic estrogen signaling in ER-negative breast cancer cells
To determine if ER-α36 mediates mitogenic estrogen signaling in these breast cancer cells,
we designed two shRNA expression vectors targeting different regions of the 3′UTR of ERα36 and established two clonal cell lines from MDA-MB-231 cells that express these two
different shRNAs. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with an empty expression vector or an
expression vector for shRNA against firefly luciferase were used as controls. Both Western
blot analysis and RT-PCR demonstrated that ER-α36 expression was knocked-down about

80% in the shRNA expression vector transfected cells compared with control cells (Figure
2A). E2β treatment failed to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, expression of c-Myc and
cyclin D1, and cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cell lines with knocked-down level of
ER-α36 expression (Figure 2B & C). Similar results were also observed in MDA-MB-436
cells with knocked-down levels of ER-α36 expression (Figure 2D–G). However, serum was
still able to induce ERK activation in MDA-MB-436 cells with knocked-down level of ERα36 expression (Figure 2E), indicating there was no defect of the MAPK/ERK signaling in
cells with ER-α36 expression knocked-down. These results demonstrated that ER-α36
mediates non-genomic and mitogenic estrogen signaling in these ER-negative breast cancer
cells.

Author Manuscript

Previously, ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were found to express ER-β, a
subtype of estrogen receptor (Tong et al., 2002). Western blot analysis showed that MDAMB-231 cells express higher levels of ER-β compared to ER-positive MCF7 cells while
MDA-MB-436 cells express undetectable levels of ER-β (Supplement Figure 2A). To
determine whether ER-β is involved in the estrogen effects observed in MDA-MB-231 cells,
we knocked-down ER-β expression in MDA-MB-231 cells with transient transfection of
ER-β siRNA. The estrogen effects such as activation of the MAPK/ERK and stimulation of
cell proliferation were intact and even with a slight increase (Supplement Figure 2 B, C, D,),
suggesting that ER-β may negatively regulates mitogenic estrogen signaling-mediated by
ER-α36.

Author Manuscript

To assess the effect of estrogen signaling on the tumorigenicity of these cells, Two MDAMB-231 cell lines with knocked-down levels of ER-α36 expression and a control cell line
transfected with the empty expression vector were inoculated subcutaneously into the fatpad
of ovariectomized female nude mice. Five days before inoculation, mice were implanted
with E2β or placebo pellets. In two independent experiments, tumors were readily detected
at all sites injected with vector-control cells in the absence and presence of estrogen
supplement (Figure 3A). However, the tumors that formed in the presence of estrogen
developed more rapidly than their counterparts without estrogen. Additionally, MDAMB-231 cells with knocked-down level of ER-α36 expression failed to form tumors in the
absence of estrogen while formed tumors less efficiently compared with control cells in the
presence of estrogen (Figure 3A). Our results were in good agreement with the previous
report that estrogen was able to stimulate malignant growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo
(Friedl and Jordan, 1994).

Author Manuscript

To test whether the tumor-enhancing effects of estrogen extended to weakly tumorigenic
breast cancer cells, we repeated the above experiment with MDA-MB-436 cells. The vectorcontrol MDA-MB-436 cells formed palpable mammary tumors in about 6 weeks in the
absence of estrogen. In contrast, the vector-control cells in the supplement of estrogen
formed tumor with higher efficiency and a significant shorter latency, arising 2 to 3 weeks
before their counterparts without estrogen. MDA-MB-436 cells with knocked-down level of
ER-α36 expression did not form tumors in the absence of estrogen even in a prolonged
incubation (20 weeks) while developed tumors with much less efficiency in the presence of
estrogen. These experiments demonstrated estrogen stimulated malignant growth of these
ER-negative breast cancer cells in vivo.

EGFR protein is stabilized by ER-α36 in ER-negative breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The finding that ER-α36 down-regulation dramatically suppresses the tumorigenicity of
these ER-negative breast cancer cells in the absence of estrogen was surprising since these
cells also express high levels of EGFR, which would promote malignant growth in vivo. To
elucidate the underlying mechanisms, Western blot analysis was performed to examine the
expression levels of EGFR protein in the cells with ER-α36 expression knocked-down.
Figure 4A shows that expression levels of EGFR protein were dramatically decreased in
MDA-MB-231 cell lines with ER-α36 expression knocked-down compared with control
cells. However, we did not observe significant change for the mRNA levels of EGFR in
these cells, suggesting that the steady state levels of EGFR protein were decreased in ERα36 knocked-down MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4A). A similar destabilization of EGFR
protein was also observed in MDA-MB-436 cells with knocked-down levels of ER-α36
expression (Figure 4B). Western blot analysis further demonstrated that upon treatment with
MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, the levels of EGFR protein in the ER-α36 knocked-down
cells were restored to levels comparable with those of control cells (Figure 4C), indicating
that the protein degradation of EGFR was enhanced in ER-α36 down-regulated cells. Thus,
ER-a36 is involved in regulation of the steady state levels of EGFR protein.
EGFR signaling up-regulates ER-α36 expression

Author Manuscript

Recently, we cloned the promoter region of ER-a36 and identified that ER-a36 promoter
harbors several Ap-1 binding sites (Zou et al., 2009), suggesting that ER-a36 expression
may be subjected to regulation of the growth factor signaling pathways. To determine
whether EGFR signaling influences ER-α36 expression, we treated both cell lines with the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002, EGFR inhibitors BiBx, AG1478 and Gefitinib, and the Src
inhibitor PP2. Figure 5A shows that treatment with the EGFR inhibitors strongly downregulated ER-α36 expression at both protein and mRNA levels in both cell lines while the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect. Our data thus suggested that ER-α36 transcription
is subjected to positive regulation by EGFR signaling.

Author Manuscript

To examine if EGFR signaling directly up-regulates ER-α36 promoter activity, we
performed co-transfection assays in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that express
no detectable levels of both ER-α36 and EGFR. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected
with a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the ER-α36 promoter (Zou et al., 2009). EGFR
co-transfection resulted in an about 3-fold induction of ER-α36 promoter activity, which
was blocked by pre-treatment of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and Gefitinib, and the Src
inhibitor PP2, but not by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Figure 5B&C). When a series of 5′
truncated promoter of ER-α36 (Figure 5B) was used, we found that EGFR expression failed
to activate the promoter activity of the pER36-513 reporter plasmid (Figure 5B). Close
examination of DNA sequence in the deleted region revealed an AP-1-binding site located
between −541 to −551 (relative to the transcription initiation site) residues of the ER-α36
promoter region (Figure 5B). Mutation of this Ap-1 site abrogated induction of ER-α36
promoter activity by EGFR co-transfection (Figure 5B), suggesting that EGFR signaling
activated ER-α36 promoter activity through the EGFR/Src/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway.

ER-α36 interacts with the EGFR complex and mediates E2β-induced phosphorylation of
Src and EGFR
To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying ER-α36 functions, we examined whether
ERα36 interacts with the EGFR complex. MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected
with an expression vector for HA-tagged ER-α36 and co-immunoprecipitation assays were
performed with cell lysates from transfected cells. Figure 6A shows that EGFR, Src and Shc
co-existed in the immunoprecipitates of the anti-HA antibody. We also noticed that the
levels of EGFR in the immunoprecipitates were slightly decreased after E2β treatment while
the levels of Shc and Src were increased (Figure 6A). In MDA-MB-436 cells, interaction
between EGFR and ER-α36 was also observed in the absence of E2β. After treatment of E2β
for 1 hour, ER-α36 was gradually dissociated from the EGFR and associated with Src and
Shc (Figure 6B).

We also examined changes of the phosphorylation levels of EGFR with different phosphospecific antibodies against different residues of EGFR including Tyr-845, Tyr-992,
Tyr-1045, Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1173 in MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence and absence of
E2β. We found that Tyr845 was the only residue that was phosphorylated after E2β
application (Supplement Figure 3) and E2β elicited a transient increase of EGFR-Tyr-845
phosphorylation; started at 5 min and declined at 30 min (Figure 6C). The E2β-induced
phosphorylation was totally abrogated by the Src inhibitor PP2 but partially blocked by the
EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Figure 6C & D), consistent with the previous report that Src
phosphorylates EGFR at Tyr-845 (Biscardi et al., 1999). We also observed that E2β
treatment induced phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416 (Figure 6C), which was totally blocked
by the Src inhibitor PP2 but partially by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Figure 6D), consistent
with the activation pattern of the MAPK/ERK by E2β (Figure 6D). These results indicated
that the EGFR/Src/Shc complex is involved in transduction of the non-genomic estrogen
signaling mediated by ER-α36.

Discussion
In this report, we found that ten out of twelve cases of triple-negative breast cancer
expressed ER-α36, predominantly on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. EGFR
expression was detected in six cases, four of which co-expressed ER-α36, indicated that a
subset of triple-negative breast cancer co-expresses ER-α36 and EGFR. We then used
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells as models to study the effects of the non-genomic
estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 on the malignant growth of ER-negative breast
cancer.

Author Manuscript

Here, we found that ER-negative breast cancer cells that lack expression of ER-α66 but
expresses ER-α36 exhibited a potent mitogenic estrogen signaling in vitro and in vivo.
Previously, other laboratories failed to observe estrogen-stimulated growth of MDAMB-231 cells in vitro (Friedl and Jordan, 1994; Rai et al., 2005) but found stimulatory
effects of estrogen in vivo (Friedl and Jordan, 1994). One possible explanation to the
discrepancy between their data and ours is that the in vitro proliferation experiments by
these laboratories were conducted in phenol-red free medium supplemented with 10-5%
charcoal-treated fetal calf serum and assayed in 7 or 8 days, which made MDA-MB-231

cells that express high levels of EGFR, to grow at a rapid rate in serum-supplemented
medium. The stimulating effects of estrogen-signaling on proliferation of these cells are
negligible most time (Friedl and Jordan, 1994; Rai et al., 2005). To minimize the growth
rate of MDA-MB-231 cells, we used phenol-red free medium containing 2.5% charcoaltreated serum (the minimum concentration that keeps MDA-MB-231 cell viable) and
increased estrogen treatment time to 12 days in our growth assays. Under these conditions,
we consistently observed potent growth promoting effects of estrogen on proliferation of
these ER-negative breast cancer cells. . It is worth noting that E2β also stimulated growth of
the ER-negative endometrial carcinoma cells in athymic mice (Friedl et al., 1989),
consistent with our recent report that ER-α36 is expressed in ER-negative endometrial
carcinoma cells (Lin et al., 2010).

Previously, ER-negative breast cancer cells were found to express ER-β receptor (Tong et
al., 2002). However, the role of ER-β in ER-negative breast cancer is largely unknown.
Previous studies showed that ER-β inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cells by
repressing c-myc and cyclin D1 (Lazennec et al., 2001; Paruthiyil et al., 2004; Behrens et
al., 2007). In this study, we used ER-β specific siRNA to knock-down ER-β expression in
MDA-MB-231 cells and found that cells with knocked-down levels of ER-β expression
retained a full (or even increased) response to mitogenic estrogen signaling, suggesting that
ER-β may negatively regulate ER-α36 mediated non-genomic estrogen signaling and that
the inhibitory activities of ER-β may be also involved in failure of c-myc and cyclin D1
induction and loss of the tumorigenecity observed in MDA-MB-231 cells with knockeddown levels of ER-α36 expression.

In the present study, we also revealed a novel cross-talk mechanism in which EGFR and
ER-α36 positively regulate each other’s expression, which may play an important role in
malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer. We also showed that E2β induced the
MAPK/ERK activation through a mechanism that involves ER-α36 and the EGFR/Src/Shc
complex. We noted that ER-α36 interacted strongly with EGFR in the absence of estrogen
while interaction between ER-α36 and the Src/Shc was estrogen dependent, suggesting that
ER-α36 may dynamically change its partners during estrogen signaling. We also found that
E2β predominantly induced phosphorylation of the EGFR-Tyr-845 residue but not the major
auto-phosphorylation sites of EGFR such as Tyr-992, -1068 and -1073. EGFR Tyr-845 is a
site phosphorylated by activated Src (Biscardi et al., 1999). Consistent with this, we found
that E2β also induced Src-Tyr-416 phosphorylation and the Src inhibitor PP2 blocked E2βinduced phosphorylation of Src-Tyr-416 and EGFR-Tyr-845 while the EGFR inhibitor
AG1478 had less effect. Our results thus indicated that EGFR/Src complex plays an integral
role in mitogenic estrogen signaling in ER-negative breast cancer cells that express ER-α36.

Clinical evidence established that ER-negative breast cancer is less or no responsive to antiestrogen therapy, which would be at the odds with our finding that estrogen signaling is
involved in malignant growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells. It is well known that
tamoxifen acts as both agonist and antagonist. Recently, we found that ER-α36 mediated
agonist action of tamoxifen in ER-negative endometrial cancer cells via the MAPK/ERK
and PI3K/Akt pathways (Lin et al., 2010). It is thus possible that ER-α36 may mediates
tamoxifen agonist effects in the ER-negative breast cancer that express ERα36. ICI 182,

780, a “pure” anti-estrogen, works by accelerating degradation of ER-α66 protein (Howell
et al., 2000). Recently, we reported that ICI 182, 780 failed to induce degradation of ERα36 (Kang and Wang, 2009) presumably because ER-α36 has a truncated ligand-binding
domain that lacks the last 4 helices (helix 9–12) of ER-α66 (Wang et al., 2005); the helix-12
domain is critical in protein degradation induced by ICI 182, 780 (Mahfoudi et al., 1995).
This may provide a molecular explanation for the clinical evidence that these anti-estrogens
failed to inhibit growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells that express ER-α36. We also
found these ER-negative breast cancer cells responded to very low concentrations of
estrogen; activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling at 10−16M/L, suggesting that cells
expressing high levels of ER-α36 are hypersensitive to estrogen. Thus, ER-negative breast
cancer that expresses high levels of ER-α36 may be hypersensitive to estrogen, which may
render this subset of breast cancer less sensitive to aromatase inhibitors that usually suppress
the plasma level of E2β to a mean of picomolar (pM) range (Geisler et al., 2002).

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have shown that ER-α36 expressing ER-negative breast cancer cells
retained mitogenic responses to estrogen, suggesting that non-genomic estrogen signaling
contributes to development and progression of ER-negative breast cancer that express ERα36. Thus, ER-α36 is a novel player in mitogenic estrogen signaling that may play
important roles in mammary tumorigenesis and in other types of estrogen-related tumors as
well.
