BACKGROUND: The prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor, particularly among
patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). This study evaluated the efficacy of combined 5-fluorouracil and
pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) a-2b in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Subjects comprised 59 HCC patients
with PVTT treated using subcutaneous administration of PEG-IFNa-2b (50-100 lg on day 1 of each week for 4 weeks)
and intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/d for 5 hours on days 1-5 of each week for 4 weeks). One treatment cycle lasted 4 weeks. The current therapy was discontinued in patients with progressive disease (PD). For
responses other than PD, treatment was repeated for 1 cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective early
response rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. RESULTS:
Objective early response rate was 73.0%. Cumulative PFS rates were 67.4% at 6 months, 30.2% at 12 months, 25.9%
at 18 months, and 20.7% at 24 months. Median PFS was 9.7 months. Cumulative survival rates were 82.4% at 6
months, 73.6% at 12 months, 52.8% at 24 months, and 44.0% at 36 months. Median survival time was 29.9 months. All
adverse reactions were controllable by temporary suspension of treatment. Serious complications and treatmentrelated deaths were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although a prospective randomized controlled trial using a larger
population of patients with advanced HCC is needed to evaluate combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil and PEGIFNa-2b, this new combination therapy may be useful for patients with advanced HCC. Cancer 2012;118:3302-10.

INTRODUCTION
The prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor, particularly among patients with portal vein
tumor thrombosis (PVTT). The majority of patients with PVTT survive no longer than 6 months after initial diagnosis.13
PVTT causes widespread intrahepatic and extrahepatic dissemination by spreading out of tumor cells through the portal
tract. Furthermore, PVTT, particularly in the first branch (Vp3) or main trunk (Vp4), can cause portal hypertension
resulting in variceal rupture, uncontrollable ascites, ischemic liver failure, and worsening of performance status (PS).4
These pathological states lead to simultaneous decreases in quality of life; hence, any treatment for HCC is contraindicated
under such conditions, especially for those patients with HCC and PVTT in Vp3 or Vp4.
Two recent phase 3 clinical trials have shown that sorafenib, an orally available multikinase inhibitor, improves
median overall survival in patients with advanced HCC.5,6 However, patients with HCC and PVTT usually have very
short survival and grave prognosis even when treated with sorafenib.7

Conversely, recent advances in implantable drug
delivery systems have enabled repeated arterial infusion of
chemotherapeutic agents.8,9 Compared with systemic
chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy
(HAIC) has the benefits of increasing the local concentration of drugs and reducing systemic side effects. This
approach has thus been used in palliative treatment for
patients with HCC complicated by PVTT in Japan. Several authors in this field have reported the efficacy of
HAIC, with favorable results achieved using a regimen
consisting of 5-fluorouracil and interferon (IFN) a.10,11
Pegylation of therapeutic proteins is a well-established method for delaying clearance and reducing protein
immunogenicity, and pegylated proteins are safe and
effective in humans.12,13 Since 2005, pegylated (PEG)
IFNa2b has been available as a therapy for hepatitis C
virus (HCV)-related chronic hepatitis (CH). In contrast
to IFNa, PEG-IFNa-2b is administered once weekly,
allowing the maintenance of higher plasma concentrations.14 The therapeutic effects of 5-fluorouracil combined with PEG-IFNa-2b may thus exceed those of 5fluorouracil combined with IFNa. We have already
administered 5-fluorouracil and PEG-IFNa-2b to
patients displaying advanced HCC with PVTT and
reported favorable preliminary results.15,16 The aim of
this study was to elucidate the efficacy of this therapy by
analyzing the clinical results in 59 HCC patients with
PVTT treated in this manner.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility criteria for treatment were as follows: 1) PVTT
grade Vp2-Vp4; 2) no indications for radiotherapy, surgical resection, or nonsurgical interventions such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave coagulation
therapy (MCT), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), or
transhepatic arterial chemoembolization; 3) age >20
years; 4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS4 level
0-2; 5) no uncontrollable ascites or pleural effusion; 6)
platelet count >0.5  105/lL, leukocyte count >2000/
lL, total bilirubin <3 mg/dL, and serum creatinine <1.5
mg/dL; and 7) CH or compensated cirrhosis with a
Child-Pugh class of A or B.
The presence of PVTT was confirmed in all cases
using the following criteria: 1) a low-attenuation intraluminal mass that expanded the portal vein or portal branch
on ultrasonography (US) or enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan; 2) the thread-and-streaks signs, which

Cancer

reflect intraportal tumor growth or arterioportal shunts
on hepatic angiography; or 3) filling defects in the portal
vein or in the portal branch on an indirect portogram
obtained from a venous phase angiogram of the superior
mesenteric artery. Portal venous thrombosis was excluded
from the criteria of PVTT. PVTT grade was determined
according to the criteria of the Liver Cancer Study Group
of Japan.17 PVTT grading was as follows: Vp0, no PVTT;
Vp1, tumor thrombus in a third or more of peripheral
branches of the portal vein; Vp2, tumor thrombus in a
second branch of the portal vein; Vp3, tumor thrombus
in the first branch of the portal vein; and Vp4, tumor
thrombus in the trunk of the portal vein.
Underlying liver conditions such as CH or cirrhosis
were confirmed by laboratory, pathological, and radiological examinations. Liver function in CH was classified as
Child-Pugh class A, because chronic hepatitis is a known
precirrhotic condition.
Patients
Between September 2006 and November 2010, a total of
143 consecutive HCC patients with PVTT were admitted
to the Hospital of Iwate Medical University. Diagnosis of
HCC was assessed by CT, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and abdominal US. Furthermore, CT was
obtained during arterial portography and computed tomographic hepatic arteriography. Further assessment of
HCC was conducted by measuring levels of a-fetoprotein
(AFP) and des-c-carboxy prothrombin (DCP). On the
basis of these examinations, all patients were diagnosed
with advanced HCC and were thus considered unsuitable
for surgical resection or nonsurgical interventions such as
RFA, MCT, PEI, or transhepatic arterial chemoembolization. Among these 143 patients, 89 met the eligibility criteria described above. Of those 89 HCC patients with
PVTT, 59 patients agreed to be treated with HAIC using
5-fluorouracil and PEG-IFNa-2b.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
All study protocols were approved by the ethics committee of Iwate Medical University in accordance with the
1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Technique of Catheter Placement
The catheter was inserted through the femoral artery using
the Seldinger method. After detection of HCC, an indwelling 4- or 5-Fr catheter (Anthron P-U Catheter;
Toray Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was placed. The tip of the
catheter was placed in the common or proper hepatic artery. The other end of the catheter was connected to the

injection port, and the device was implanted in a subcutaneous pocket. The gastroduodenal and right gastric
arteries were occluded using steel coils (interlocking
detachable coil, Diamond coil; Boston Scientific, Natick,
Mass) to prevent gastroduodenal injury from anticancer
agents. To prevent occlusion of the catheter, 5 mL (5000
U) of heparin solution was infused biweekly via the injection port.
Treatment Regimen
After insertion of the drug delivery system, patients
received arterial infusion of chemotherapeutic agents via
the injection port. Patients were treated with subcutaneous administration of PEG-IFNa-2b (PegIntron; Schering-Plough, Osaka, Japan) and intra-arterial infusion of
5-fluorouracil (Kyowa Hakko, Tokyo, Japan). One treatment cycle lasted 4 weeks. PEG-IFNa-2b dose was
weight-adjusted (50 lg for body weight 50 kg, 100 lg
for body weight >50 kg) and administered subcutaneously on day 1 of every week. Administration of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/d) into the hepatic artery for 5 hours via
mechanical infusion pump was performed on days 1 to 5
of each week.
Evaluation of Therapeutic Effects
The primary efficacy endpoint of the current study was
the objective response rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints
were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS). In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses
were performed to determine predictors of survival.
CT or MRI was performed before and after treatment. CT or MRI images were reviewed by 2 radiologist
who did not participate in the procedures. In addition to
serum biochemical markers, tumor markers such as AFP
or DCP were also measured before and after treatment.
The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated by assessments performed 4 weeks after initiating treatment.
Therapeutic effects were also evaluated by CT or MRI
inspection every 2 months to 3 months. Tumors were
bidimensionally measured by dynamic CT or dynamic
MRI. Response to treatment was evaluated according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.18
Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) was
defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of maximum
diameters of target lesions compared with the baseline
sum of maximum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) was
defined as a 20% increase in the sum of maximum
diameters of target lesions. Stable disease (SD) was
defined as disease meeting neither PR nor PD criteria.

3304

PFS was calculated from the time of initiating treatment to disease progression, death, or last follow-up visit.
OS was calculated from the time of initiating treatment to
death or last follow-up visit.
The current therapy was discontinued in patients
with PD. For responses other than PD, treatment was
repeated for 1 cycle. A 1- to 2-month rest period of no
treatment was allowed after each treatment course. Toxicity was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0 (NCICTC).19 When side effects of grade 3 or more according
to NCI-CTC with the exception of platelet and leukocyte
counts of <30,000/lL and 2000/lL, respectively, were
identified, treatment was immediately terminated.
Additional Therapy
In principle, the treatment course was repeated several
times unless the tumor progressed during the therapy.
Then, when down-staging of advanced HCC was
achieved (single tumor 50 mm in diameter or 1-3
tumors 30 mm in diameter) by the repeated therapy,
surgical resection or RFA was considered. For patients
assessed with PD, additional therapies such as systemic
chemotherapy, intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with
Lipiodol-cisplatin suspension, or best supportive care
(BSC) were considered.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline data are expressed as mean  standard deviation
or as median and range. Statistical analysis was performed
on December 1, 2010. Cumulative survival rate and PFS
were calculated from the date of therapy initiation and
assessed by the Kaplan-Meier life-table method, and differences were evaluated using the log-rank test. Univariate
analysis of predictors for survival of patients was assessed
by the Kaplan-Meier life-table method, and differences
were evaluated using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis of predictors for survival was assessed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Statistical significance was
defined for values of P < .05. All analyses described above
were performed using SPSS version 11 software (SPSS,
Chicago, Ill).

Additional Therapy
Among the 43 patients who achieved CR/PR, 5 patients
(11.6%) and 1 patient (2.3%) were treated with surgical
resection and RFA, respectively, as additional therapies.
Conversely, among the 16 patients who showed SD/PD,
4 patients (25.0%), 1 patient (6.2%), and 5 patients
(31.2%) were treated with systemic chemotherapy, intraarterial infusion chemotherapy with Lipiodol-cisplatin
suspension, and BSC, respectively, as additional therapies.
The remaining 6 patients (37.6%) who were maintaining
SD were treated with 5-fluorouracil and PEG-IFNa-2b
repeatedly. After the additional therapies, 8 (13.5%) of 59
patients (2 CR patients, and 6 PR patients who had effective additional therapies) exhibited disappearance of viable HCC. The median PFS and OS in patients not
receiving additional therapies such as surgical resection or
RFA were 7.6 months and 29.2 months, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Advanced HCC is often accompanied by PVTT, but no
standard therapeutic modality has been established for
HCC with PVTT, particularly for Vp3 and Vp4. Prognosis is very poor, and several investigators have reported
that the survival period for HCC patients with PVTT is
typically around 2 months to 3 months.21-23 Moreover,
the degree of PVTT is a significant clinicopathological
variable known to influence survival in patients with
advanced HCC.24 However, this vascular involvement is
generally refractory to treatment. Although surgery is considered the most effective treatment for HCC patients
with PVTT, surgery is suitable in only a limited number
of cases because of the dissemination of the tumor
throughout the liver or concomitant cirrhosis. Although
transhepatic arterial chemoembolization has also been
Cancer

widely applied to unresectable HCC, reported outcomes
have been poor, particularly for HCC with Vp3 and
Vp4.25,26 Two recent phase 3 clinical trials have shown
that sorafenib, an orally available multikinase inhibitor,
improves median overall survival in patients with
advanced HCC.5,6 Llovet et al20 have proposed the use of
sorafenib as a first-line treatment for patients with HCC
categorized as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C.
However, patients with HCC and PVTT usually have
very short survival and grave prognosis even when treated
with sorafenib.7
Recent progress in implantable drug delivery systems has enabled repeated arterial infusion of chemotherapeutic agents for patients with advanced HCC. Regional
HAIC is a reasonable drug delivery system for patients
with advanced HCC, because the tumors derive most of
their blood supply from the hepatic artery, whereas the
portal vein supplies the normal liver parenchyma.27
HAIC thus seems to selectively deliver high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to HCC tissues, with
low toxicity to noncancerous liver tissues and the whole
body. Several groups have reported the combination therapy of intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin for HCC
with Vp3 and Vp4.28,29 Furthermore, recent reports have
described the efficacy and survival benefits of combination therapy using intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil and systemic IFNa for advanced HCC.10,11
Concerning the antitumor effects of combination
therapy with 5-fluorouracil and IFNa for advanced
HCC, IFNa increases intracellular concentrations of 5fluoro-2-deoxyuridine 5-monophosphate, the metabolite
of 5-fluorouracil in the body,30 thus enhancing cytotoxicity against malignant tumor cells31,32 and elevating inhibition of thymidylate synthetase.32 In addition, IFNa
suppresses cancer cells directly and/or indirectly via several

3307

pathways, such as inhibition of the cell cycle, boosting
p53 activation, and activation of immunocytes.33-37
Moreover, Kondo et al38 reported that the combination
of 5-fluorouracil and IFNa strongly induces cell growth
inhibition of human HCC cells and indicated that the
effects of combination therapy may be attributable to
alterations in the induction of apoptosis through IFNa/b
receptor in human HCC cells.
PEG-IFNa-2b has been widely used since 2005 as a
drug to treat CH patients with HCV infection. This agent
is a derivative of recombinant IFNa-2b containing a single straight-chain molecule of polyethylene glycol, which
has an average molecular weight of 12,000 Da, attached
by covalent linkage primarily to histidine-34 on IFNa2b.39 Pegylation of IFNa-2b does not compromise the
tertiary structure or spectrum of activity, but significantly
decreases clearance, achieving a 10-fold increase in plasma
half-life.14 As a result, PEG-IFNa-2b can be administered
once weekly, and the increased area under the curve compared with standard 3 weekly dosing with IFNa-2b
results in increased drug exposure without a proportional
increase in toxicity.14 The therapeutic effects of 5-fluorouracil combined with PEG-IFNa-2b may thus exceed
those of 5-fluorouracil combined with IFNa. Yano et al40
compared in vivo antitumor effects of PEG-IFNa-2b and
IFNa in nude mice injected with cultured HCC cells
(HAK-1B), and revealed that PEG-IFNa-2b induced
apoptosis more strongly than IFNa. Furthermore, they
reported that the antitumor effect of PEG-IFNa-2b was
expressed at approximately 1=3 of the clinical dose. On the
basis of these results, in this study we used 5-fluorouracil
and PEG-IFNa-2b, not IFNa. This fact might have contributed to the better results in our study compared with
the previous 5-fluorouracil and IFNa studies.10,11
Compared with previous reports describing 5-fluorouracil and IFNa combination therapy,10,11 the present
regimen used a different method of 5-fluorouracil administration. In previous reports, 5-fluorouracil was administered at 450 to 500 mg/d into the hepatic artery with
continuous infusion over 5 hours or 24 hours on days 1 to
5 of weeks 1 and 2. Conversely, 5-fluorouracil in the present study was administered at 250 mg/d into the hepatic
artery for 5 hours on days 1 to 5 each week. This period of
administration was used because 5-fluorouracil is classified as a time-dependent drug exhibiting cytotoxic activities.41 In addition, 5-fluorouracil induces apoptosis in a
dose-dependent manner.42 Ueshima et al43 investigated
combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin for
advanced HCC by comparing 5- and 24-hour administra-

3308

tion of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/d), and reported a higher
objective response rate for the 5-hour administration. We
selected the administration time and period for 5-fluorouracil based on the effects of dose-dependent and longterm administration of 5-fluorouracil. These facts also
might have contributed to the good results achieved in
this study.
The overall median survival rate in the present study
was 29.9 months. The outcome in the present study was
far superior to that of a sorafenib study.6 In the SHARP
trial,6 among the 299 patients who were treated with sorafenib, 2 patients (2%) and 211 patient (71%) had PR and
SD, respectively. Conversely, the response rate in the present study was 73.0%, and 8 (13.5%) of 59 patients exhibited disappearance of viable HCC after the additional
therapies. Although sorafenib is likely to delay disease
progression, it is probably not suitable to make patients
tumor free. Moreover, the SHARP trial6 showed that the
rate of sorafenib discontinuation because of adverse events
was 38%, and dose reductions because of adverse events
occurred in 26% of patients who were treated using sorafenib. In contrast, there was no discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events in this study, and dose
reductions because of adverse events occurred in only 5%
of patients treated using 5-fluorouracil and PEG-IFNa2b. This relatively mild level of side effects enabled continuation of the basic regimen and may lead to marked
clinical effects, because tumor regrowth is often observed
at times when treatment is interrupted because of adverse
effects.
In our study, the early response cumulative survival
rate was significantly higher in patients who achieved CR/
PR than in those with SD/PD (P < .001). Early response
is an important post-treatment predictor of survival
among patients with advanced HCC with 5-fluorouracil
and PEG-IFNa-2b combination therapy. Early response
of CR or PR is a sign of good prognosis.
Nagamatsu et al44 recently reported the efficacy
of HAIC using intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil and Lipiodolcisplatin for HCC patients with grade Vp2, Vp3, and
Vp4 PVTT. In their report, the response rate was 86.3%,
and overall survival rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were
72.9%, 58.1%, and 34.9%, respectively, with an overall
median survival of 33 months. Although our regimen differed from theirs, the efficacies of treatment were similar.
A recent study demonstrated that sorafenib prolongs the
survival of patients with advanced HCC.6 However,
many unresolved issues remain regarding the optimal
usage of sorafenib. In particular, most patients enrolled in

this trial showed Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis with favorable clinical parameters. The benefits and safety profile of
sorafenib in unselected advanced HCC patients, particularly those with Child-Pugh B/C or other poor prognostic
factors, remain unclear. In the present study and the previous investigation by Nagamatsu et al, almost half of the
patients had Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis. Nevertheless,
good results were observed in patients who received
HAIC therapy.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the
efficacy of HAIC with PEG-IFNa-2b and 5-fluorouracil
for advanced HCC patients. Furthermore, most adverse
effects were transient and well tolerated. On the basis of
our findings, this newly developed combination therapy is
likely to be useful for patients with advanced HCC,
although a large-scale randomized controlled study in
comparison with sorafenib or HAIC using intra-arterial
5-fluorouracil and Lipiodol-cisplatin is needed to properly evaluate the efficacy of this therapy.
