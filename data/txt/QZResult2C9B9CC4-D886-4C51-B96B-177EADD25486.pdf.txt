ABSTRACT
We investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in ALDH2, which has been associated with alcohol dependence and several
types of diseases, and the risk of drug addiction in a Chinese Han population. In a
case-control study that included 692 cases and 700 healthy controls, eight SNPs in
ALDH2 were selected and genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional
logistic regression after adjusting for age and gender. We determined that rs671
is significantly associated with a 1.551-fold increased drug addiction risk (95% CI
= 1.263-1.903; p < 0.001). In the genetic model analysis, we found that rs671 is
associated with an increased risk of drug addiction under additive, dominant and
recessive models (p < 0.001), while rs886205, rs441 and rs4646778 displayed a
decreased drug addiction risk under additive and recessive model, respectively (p
< 0.05). SNP rs671 remained significant after Bonferroni correction (p<0.00125).
Additionally, we observed that haplotype “GTCAC” was associated with increased drug
addiction risk (OR = 1.668; 95% CI, 1.328–2.094, p < 0.001); in contrast, “ATCGC”
was a protective haplotype for drug addiction risk (OR = 0.444; 95% CI, 0.281–
0.704, p < 0.001). Our findings showed that ALDH2 polymorphisms are significantly
associated with the risk of drug addiction in the Chinese Han population.

Genome wide association studies have demonstrated that
genetic polymorphisms in ALDH2 are associated with
many alcohol-related conditions [4-6], which has led to
studies of the association between ALDH2 and various
cancers and disease. For example, rs671 in ALDH2 was
found to be associated with accelerated deterioration of
bone marrow in Japanese anemia patients [7]. Rs886205 in
ALDH2 has been identified as a risk marker for esophagus
cancer in African populations [8]. However, few studies
have investigated the association between genetic
polymorphisms in ALDH2 and the risk of drug addiction.
To investigate the association between ALDH2 and
drug addiction risk, we genotyped eight variants in ALDH2
associated with alcohol dependence and performed a
comprehensive association analysis to identify SNPs

INTRODUCTION
Drug addiction is widespread in the world. The
number of drug addicts is increasing every year. Previous
study have suggested that the drug addiction is a
multifactorial process which is influenced by many factors,
such as impulsivity, risk taking, anxiety, depression and
stress responsivity as well as gene variation [1, 2]. Among
these factors, environment factors and curiosity were
considered as the most important reason for initial drug
use; however, recent study shown that the contribution of
inherited factors (mainly genetic) to development of drug
addictions is approximately 50% [3].
Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a key
enzyme in the oxidation process of acetaldehyde to acetate.

Bonferroni’s multiple adjustment was applied, with p<0.00125 (0.05/40).
The genotype frequencies of the ALDH2
polymorphisms were shown in Table 3. Compared with
the “CC” genotype, the “AC” frequency of rs4646778
polymorphism among cases were significantly different
from the controls (AC vs. CC: OR= 1.271, 95% CI
= 1.001-1.614; p = 0.048), which suggested that the
rs4646778 polymorphism had an increased effect on drug
addiction risk. Similarly, compared with individuals with
the rs671 “GG” genotype, individuals with “AA” genotype
had a significantly increased drug addiction risk (AA vs.
GG: OR= 2.638, 95% CI = 1.180-5.899; p = 0.018). In
addition, individuals with rs671 “AG” genotype also had
a significantly increased drug addiction risk compared
with “GG” genotype (AG vs. GG: OR= 1.646, 95% CI =
1.269-2.133; p < 0.001), which remained significant after
Bonferroni correction (p<0.00125).
We further assessed the association between each
SNP and drug addiction risk in an unconditional logistic
regression analysis, which was performed using three
models: additive, dominant and recessive model (Table
4). The minor allele A of rs886205 was associated with a
decreased drug addiction risk under additive model (OR=
0.782, 95% CI = 0.613-0.998; p = 0.048). The minor

RESULTS
This study included 692 drug addicts (594 men,
98 women; mean age 44.66±6.12 years) and 700 healthy
controls (393 men, 307 women; mean age 48.53±9.44
years). The clinical characteristics of cases and controls
are shown in Table 1. Age (p<0.001) and sex (p<0.001)
were significantly different between cases and healthy
controls. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for age and
sex.
The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of the
analyzed SNPs in the case and control groups are
shown in Table 2. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) in the controls (p > 0.05) with the
exception of rs2238152, rs4648328 and rs7296651, which
were excluded from subsequent analyses. Using chisquare tests, we determined that rs671 was significantly
associated with a 1.551-fold increased drug addiction
risk (95% CI = 1.263-1.903; p < 0.001), which remained
significant after Bonferroni correction (p<0.00125).

We further characterized the SNPs in ALDH2
SNPs using linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype
analyses. In the control group, one LD block was
detected (Figure 1). This block consisted of 5 closely
linked SNPs, rs886205, rs441, rs4646778, rs671 and
rs11066028. Finally, a haplotype-based association
study was performed to show the associations between
ALDH2 haplotypes and drug addiction risk (Table 5). The
haplotype “GTCAC” was associated with increased drug
addiction risk (OR = 1.668; 95% CI, 1.328–2.094, p <
0.001); in contrast, haplotype “ATCGC” was associated

a remarkable increased drug addiction risk under additive

levels [13]. In our study, we found that “AG” and “AA”
genotypes of rs671 are significantly associated with an
increased risk of drug addiction. As a result, we concluded
that carriers of the allele “A” of ALDH2 rs671 may have
low activity of ALDH2 enzymes and reduced metabolism,
resulting in increased plasma concentration and delayed
clearance of drugs. As far as we know, our study is the first
to demonstrate that rs671 affect the development of drug
addiction. Therefore, further research with a larger sample
size is needed to confirm our data.
Rs886205 (A>G) is an SNP in the promoter of
ALDH2, which has been identified as a risk marker
for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in several
Western populations [8]. Furthermore, one recent study
has reported that rs886205 is associated with altered
methylation levels of the negative regulatory promoter
fragment and corresponding ALDH2 protein levels in
alcohol-dependent patients’ blood during withdrawal
[14]. Our data shown that rs886205 is associated with
a decreased risk of drug addiction. We concluded that it
may be associated with drug addiction by influencing the
adaptation of ALDH2 protein levels during detoxification.
Previous study have reported that rs4646778
polymorphism may influence the methadone dose and
adverse reactions in patients with heroin addiction [15].
In our study, we also found that rs4646778 and rs441

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the associations
between eight selected ALDH2 SNPs and risk of drug
addiction in the Chinese Han population. We found that
rs671 is significantly associated with an increased risk
of drug addiction, while rs886205, rs441 and rs4646778
displayed decreased drug addiction risk. Our results
suggest that the polymorphisms of ALDH2 may play an
important role in the risk of drug addiction in the Chinese
Han population.
The ALDH2 gene is located on chromosome 12.
Rs671 (Glu504Lys) is a functional SNP in ALDH2, which
could decrease the normal dehydrogenase activity of
ALDH2 by approximately 90% [9, 10]. Previous study
has shown that rs671 is associated with the risk of upper
aerodigestive tract cancers in a Japanese population [11].
Later, Chinese study shown that individuals with the rs671
A allele may experience increased coronary heart disease
risk because of interfering HDL-C and endothelial ADMA
concentrations [12]. Recently, another study demonstrated
that rs671 polymorphism may influence post-stroke
epilepsy susceptibility by affecting plasma 4-HNE

displayed a decreased risk of drug addiction. However,
literatures about rs4646778 and rs441 are relatively rare.
So these results should be confirmed in further studies.
The Bonferroni correction is one of the most
important methods used to address false discovery rates
resulting from multiple testing. We found that only rs671
remained significant after Bonferroni correction, this may
due to our strict SNP filtering criteria and small sample
size. Additionally, the Bonferroni correction adjusts the
value of alpha based on the number of tests performed,
and is thus conservative; in some cases, truly significant
differences may be deemed non-significant as a result of
type II errors [16].
Our study had several intrinsic limitations. For
example, drug addiction is a very complicated process, and
environment factors such as level of education and income
are important risk factors for drug addiction. Because our
study had a relatively small size, and it did not incorporate
data regarding education and income, we could not

explore the interactions between genetic polymorphisms
and environmental factors in drug addicts. Therefore,
the relationship between ALDH2 polymorphisms and
environment factors in drug addicts must be evaluated in
future studies.
Our present study provided evidence that SNPs
in the ALDH2 are associated with drug addiction in a
Chinese Han population. It is possible that these variants
are drug addiction risk factors and these data can provide
a theoretical foundation for other researchers to further
study the association between the ALDH2 gene and drug
addiction risk in the Chinese Han or other populations.

of 692 unrelated former severe common illicit drug
addicts (including opioid, stimulants, and marijuana)
were recruited from the First People’s Hospital of Yunnan
Province from June 2014 to July 2016, and 700 healthy
controls were randomly selected from the same hospital.
Subjects were at least 18 years old who had one or more
years of daily multiple uses of narcotics and underwent
repeated random and observed urine tests. All patients
had a clinical diagnosis of drug addiction. All psychiatric
axis-I disorders were used as exclusion criteria. In
addition, participants were excluded if they had a history
of a seizure disorder (except cocaine-induced seizures)
or severe medical illness. Individuals currently being
treated with psychotropic medications or with psychiatric
symptoms, including psychosis, dementia, suicidal
or homicidal ideation, mania or depression requiring
antidepressant therapy were also excluded.
All of the participants signed an informed consent
agreement. The Human Research Committee for Approval
of Research Involving Human Subjects, the First People’s
Hospital of Yunnan Province, approved the use of human
blood in this study.

and genotype frequencies in cases and controls [23]. In
order to assess the association between each genotype and
the risk of drug addiction, three models were used, including
additive model, dominant model and recessive model. The
effects of the polymorphisms on the risk of drug addiction
were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs), computed using unconditional logistic
regression analysis with adjustments for age and sex
[24]. Finally, the patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD)
and haplotype construction was evaluated by Haploview
software package (version 4.2) [25]. All p values were
Bonferroni corrected, and statistical significance was set at
p<0.00125 (0.05/40).

We used Microsoft Excel and the SPSS 18.0
statistical package (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to perform
statistical analyses. All p values presented in this study
are two sided, and p = 0.05 was considered the cutoff for
statistical significance. The differences in the characteristics
of the case and control study population were compared
using the chi-squared test (for categorical variables) and
Welch’s t tests (for continuous variables). In all analyses, the
lower frequency allele was considered as the ‘risk’ allele.
Control genotype frequencies for each SNP were tested for
departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using
Fisher’s exact test. The χ2 test was used to compare allele
