ABSTRACT
A porous-structure nano-scale ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) was made of
monomethoxypoly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA),
and modified by double-targeted antibody: anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
and anti-carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), as a double-targeted nanoparticles
(NPs). Anti-tumor drug paclitaxel (PTX) was encapsulated in the double-targeted
nanoparticles (NPs). The morphor and release curve were characterized. We verified a
certain anticancer effect of PTX-NPs through cytotoxicity experiments. The cell uptake
result showed much more NPs may be facilitated to ingress the cells or tissues with
ultrasound (US) or ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) transient
sonoporation in vitro. Ultrasound contrast-enhanced images in vitro and in vivo were
investigated. Compared with SonoVue, the NPs prolonged imaging time in rabbit
kidneys and tumor of nude mice, which make it possible to further enhance antitumor effects by extending retention time in the tumor region. The novel doubletargeted NPs with the function of ultrasound contrast enhanced imaging and antitumor therapy can be a promising way in clinic.

adhere to the surface of pancreatic cancer cells or tissues,
sustained-release PTX to kill tumor cells or inhibition
its multiply. Besides, as a good physical promoting way,
US or UTMD may facilitate loading drugs and gene
nanoparticles uptaken by goal cells or tissues, such as
tumors, eyes, skeletal muscle, heart and bone marrow
stem cells without apparent tissue damage, and enhance
drug or gene release in situ [4-10]. Thereby, we performed
relevant experiments and found that much more doubletargeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs were transferred into
pancreatic cancer cells or tissues with US or UTMD,
compared with those without US.

INTRODUCTION
As a kind of safe biodegradable organic polymeric
material approved by the FDA for human medical use,
poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) modified with mPEG
(mPEG-PLGA) has been used in drug delivery system [1].
CA19-9 and CEA are specific markers highly expressed on
the surface of pancreatic carcinoma cells. Particularly, the
CA19-9 is rarely expressed or detected in normal tissue
cells [2, 3]. We carried out some concerned experiments
that the PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs graft-modified by CA199 and CEA antibodies may specifically recognize and

Although many researches on targeted drug-loaded
NPs delivery for tumor therapy have been done [11-15],
the study on US real-time monitoring at the same time of
anti-tumor treatment was rarely been reported.
We prepared double-targeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA
NPs with double emulsion method. The inner water
phase was removed by lyophilization and got sphericals
with porous structure which may provide a basis for the
excellent US scatterings, these nanoparticles, as a kind
of novel US nano-UCAs, compared with SonoVue that
were widely used for the clinical assessment of various
diseases, some similar good contrast enhanced imagines
with double-targeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs are showed
in vitro and in vivo. Our aim is to introduce this novel
double-targeted nano-UCA with the integration of
ultrasound contrast enhanced imaging and therapy.

viewed, much more NPs were rarely seen, which may
demonstrate that the size of this kind of novel NPs was
much less than that of SonoVue microbubble (Figure 2B).
The morphology of NPs viewed by TEM was spherical
with excellent dispersion and no aggregation (Figure 2C).
The entrapment efficiency and loading drug
efficiency of double-targeted NPs were separately
91.32±3.25% and 2.666±0.092%. About 97.57% of
PTX was released during 4 hours from PTX solution.
Whereas the release from NPs was slow and sustained
as about 40% of the total was released in 4 hours and
about 97.83% of the total was completely released in 72
hours. The PTX release rates from NPs at PH 5.0ˎ6.5ˎ7.4
condition were similar, which predicted the drug release
rates in vivo were under no influence of pH (Figure 3).
The properties of slow and sustained release made it
possible for anti-cancer drug to keep effect continuously
and efficiently.

RESULTS

Optimal US or UTMD condition

Fabrication and characterization of doubletargeted NPs

The maximum cell uptake efficiency was
39.67±2.45%. The selected optimal UTMD condition was:
power, 1 W/cm2, exposure time, 60 sec, SonoVue volume
ratio, 2:5. Under the same optimal US condition, the cell
uptake efficiency at 2:5 SonoVue volume ratio was higher
than the one at 1:5 ratio, more amplified cavitational
effects may be a major cause. (Figure 4).

In infrared spectrum of double-targeted NPs (Figure
1), there were the ester bond peak in PLGA (1757cm-1), the
amide bond peak in anti-CEA and anti-CA19-9 antibody
(1620cm-1) and the carbon-oxygen bond peak in mPEG
(1034cm-1). That proved the double-targeted NPs was
made up of mPEG-PLGA modified by targeted-antibody
(anti-CEA and anti-CA-19-9 antibody).
The peak and average size of double-targeted NPs
were respectively 136.3±5.2 nm and 88.6±3.5 nm (Figure
2A). The zeta potential of the NPs was -13.4±1.5 mv
(Figure 2B). Under light microscopy, a large quantities
of microbubbles of SonoVue degassed aqueous were

Greater and stronger red fluorescence was observed
in the cytoplasm of CFAPC-1 cell at 2 h incubation of the

which demonstrated good cell targeting of the doubletargeted NPs.
Much stronger fluorescence was respectively
observed in CFAPC-1 cells under the administration of US
than no US in both of the two NPs. Greater fluorescence
was observed in CFAPC-1 cells under the administration
of UTMD than US, which manifested US may facilitate
much more NPs into cells, while UTMD have greater
impact on cells than US (Figure 5). Red fluorescence
was found in the cytoplasm of CFAPC-1 cell, not in the
nucleus, which illustrated that it was possible for NPs to
penetrate the gap of cell membrane but it was too difficult
for them to penetrate the nuclear membrane to the inner of
nuclear, even with US and UTMD.

Echoless was showed in the degassed aqueous
neither in two-dimetional ultrasonic imaging nor in
contrast enhanced imaging. NPs and SonoVue both
showed dotted–like echoes in two-dimetional ultrasonic
imaging and in contrast enhanced imaging. The difference
was the dotted-like echoes of NPs were smaller than those
of SonoVue (Figure 7).

Cytotoxicity of double-targeted NPs

Dynamic ultrasound contrast imaging process of
rabbit kidney: To the kidney of rabbit, at the fifth second
after vein bolus-injection, NPs began filling with starshaped, at the 24th second reached to peak, last for six
seconds, at the 30th second, began pulling out quickly;
at the 48th second, began pulling out slowly, cleared up
completely until 8 minutes. Correspondingly, at the 3rd
second after vein bolus-injection, SonoVue began filling
rapidly, peaked at the 28th second, lasted for 8 seconds,
then faded swiftly, began fading slowly at 48th second,
until 5 min, dissipated entirely. The SonoVue filling peak
was higher than NPs, but the filling peak time of the
nanoparticles was ahead of that of SonoVue, the pullingout time of NPs lasted for longer than SonoVue (Figure 8).

The cell viabilities of AFPC-1 cells following
administration of PBS, SonoVue, blank NPs, US, or
UTMD for 24 or 48 h were all between 92 and 98%
(Figure 6A). No significant differences in cell viability
were identified between these groups (p>0.05).
Under the Optimal US and UTMD conditions,
it was possible for more targeted NPs to ingress the
cells, guaranteeing the cytotoxic effect (p< 0.05). US
and UTMD might promote NPs to enter the pancreatic
cancer cells, more mechanisms might be unclear besides
sonoporation. The efficiencies of US and UTMD to
enhance NPs into pancreatic cancer cells were enhanced
related to saturation of holes on the surface of cell
membranes (Figure 6B, 6C).

Dynamic ultrasound contrast enhanced imaging
process of two kinds of UCAs to the pancreas superficial
implantation tumor was observed. At the 8th second after
vein bolus-injection, NPs quickly filled the tumor from the
peripheral to the center with dendritic-shaped. At the 33th
second, the imaging strength reached peak and lasted for 35

seconds. The strength subsequently pulled out slowly and
extinguished completely in 10 minutes. Correspondingly,
SonoVue filled rapidly at the 5th second after vein bolusinjection, reached peak at the 35th second, then faded in 9
minutes. The SonoVue peak was higher than nano-UCA, but
nanoparticles lasted longer than SonoVue. (Figure 9).

Dynamic ultrasound contrast enhanced imaging
process of the pancreas orthotopic implantation tumor was
observed. At the 33th second after vein bolus-injection,
NPs filled contemporaneously to the total tumor. At
the 60th second the imaging strength reached peak and
lasted for 80 seconds. Subsequently, it pulled out slowly
in 10min. At the 38th second after vein bolus-injection,
SonoVue filled the total tumor. At the 70th second, the
imaging strength reached peak and pulled out quickly
in 10min. The pulling out time of NPs was longer than
SonoVue. (Figure 10).

cells uptake was oriented at the time of the administration
of UTMD 45min later, when cellular clathrin-dependent
endocytosis time was overlapped [21]. The reason might
be because of the suitable intensity of mPEG-PLGA.
When the ultrasound is added on SonoVue, the liposome
deforms instantly and strongly to good harmonic image.
While the porous nanoparticle of mPEG-PLGA material
may have a litter harder shell to deform weakly, possibly
becoming stronger according to its accumulation intensity
gradually. However, it was difficult for NPs (100 nm or
so) to access the nucleus owing to the effective pore size
(only 9 nm or so) of nucleus membrane [22]. Besides, the
action power of the optimal US or UTMD was safe and
impossible to affect the nucleus membranes [23, 24].
In brief, firstly, the ultrasound contrast enhanced
images were good enough to show lesions in terms of
this kind of novel targeted NPs. The hollow holes in
lyophilized multi-porous targeted NPs may be so small
that stronger ultrasonic reflection and scattering signals
would require a higher concentration of the targeted NPs
aqueous for US contrast imaging [25, 26], compared with
SonoVue. Though no obvious difference was detected at
the beginning or peak time of the two kinds of UCAs,
targeted NPs faded more slowly in comparison with
SonoVue. The longer clear-time of targeted NPs lasted for
10 min, which demonstrated that in one respect, it was
very possible for them to enter more microvasculars than
SonoVue. For another, targeted NPs could partly penetrate

DISCUSSION
Macromolecular substances like NPs may access the
cells through the mechanism of their endocytosis under the
condition of no US and UTMD. Correspondingly, some
possible impacting mechanisms of US or UTMD have
been reported as the micro-circumflex, micro-fluid actions
and so on may punch transient recoverable holes in their
surfaces to motivate NPs into the cells [16-20], though the
genuine mechanism remains unclear. Our research team
previously proposed a novel possible mechanism, which
was UTMD stimulate grid protein to promote cellular
endocytosis and detailed statements were as follows:
on one side, cells transportation consistently exists for a
long time after the action of US or UTMD, rather than
gradually weakens, for another, enhanced peak of the

into organization gaps and bind to the surface of tumor
cells to form aggregation effect.
Conventional UCAs such as lipid-shelled SonoVue
which was filled with sulfur hexafluoride gas have been
widely used in clinic work. These types of UCAs have
the function of excellent contrast enhanced imaging.
However, they cannot give some corresponding therapy
in the meanwhile. The double-targeted NPs could not
only supply contrast enhanced imaging but also deliver
drug into the tumor cells. It was a promising preparation
in clinic. There are still some efforts should be done in
our future work. The particle size should be reduced to
improve the imaging efficiency. And the drug load ratio
should be further improved to enhance tumor inhibition

dichloromethane solution and emulsified for 1.5 min by
the work-frequency (one time per 2second). Subsequently
50ml F68 solution was added and emulsified for 1min by
the same work-frequency mentioned. The dichloromethane
was removed by stirred at room temperature. The NPs was
lyophilized to remove the inner water phase.

Fabrication of the double-targeted PTX-NPs
modified by anti-CEA antibody and anti-CA19-9
antibody
50mg PTX-mPEG-PLGA was dispersed into 50ml
water and 1mg CA19-9 and 1mg CEA was added. Then,
1mg EDC and 1mg NHS were dissolved into the solution
and stirred for an hour at room temperature. The solution
was dialyzed (molecular weight cut off (MwCO=3500) for
an hour to remove EDC and NHS. The NPs solution was
then separated through a sephadex G50 column to remove
the unconjugated antibodies.

isomer (FITC) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
Company (Shanghai, China). The mPEG-PLGA (mPEG
5000, GA: LA=8:2) was donated by the Shanghai Cancer
Institute (Shanghai, China). Dialysis bags were purchased
from Lv Niao technology Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).
Paclitaxel was from Jiangsu yew pharmaceutical Co. Ltd
(Jiangsu, China). Pluronic-F68 (F68) was obtained from
BASF (China) Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). CCK-8 kit was
purchased from Dong Ren chemistry Co. Ltd (Shanghai,
China). IMDM medium and 10% fetal bovine serum,
penicillin, streptomycin were purchased from Gibco
(New York, USA). CA19-9 antibody, CEA antibody and
4, 6-diamino-2-phenyl indole (DAPI) were purchased
from Qian Chen Biological Technology Co.Ltd (Shanghai,
China). Other reagents were from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co.Ltd (Shanghai, China).
The CFAPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells were
purchased from Cell Bank, Shanghai Institutes for
Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China). SonoVue was from Bracco Imaging.
BV (Milan, Italy). The animals were supplied by the
First People’ Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao tong
University (Shanghai, China). All animal procedures were
performed according to the research protocol approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee at the First People’
Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao tong University.

The size distribution and zeta potential of the
double-targeted NPs were determined using a particle
size/zeta potential analyzer from particle sizing system,
Inc. (Florida, USA). The morphology characteristics of the
double-targeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs were observed
using transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) from
Hitachi, Ltd. (Japan). The infrared spectrum of doubletargeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs were detected by Vertex
70FT-IR Spectrometers (Germany).
We observed the double-targeted NPs compared to
SonoVue under optical microscope. 20ul NPs degassed
aqueous (mPEG-PLGA concentration: 17mg/ml) and
20ul SonoVue degassed aqueous (concentration: 17mg/
ml) were respectively observed with optical microscope.
The drug entrapment efficiency of PTX was
determined by the high performance liquid chromatograph
(HPLC). 200ul NPs water solution was added into 2ml
volumetric flask and dissolved with acetonitrile. The
NPs were dissolved by ultrasonic and filtered with
0.45μm microfiltration membrane and detected by HPLC
analyzer. The detection parameters were as follows:
Hypersil BDS C18 chromatographic column (Dalian elite
Co. 150×4.6mm, 5μm). Acetonitrile-10mmol/L NH4Ac
solution (pH 5.0) 53:47 was as the mobile phase. The
column temperature was 30°C. The flow rate was 1ml/
min. The detection wave was 227nm.
The entrapment efficiency was defined by the ratio
of the amount of PTX embedded in the double-targeted
PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs to the total amount of PTX
incipiently used. The loading drug efficiency was defined
by the ratio of the weight of PTX embedded in the doubletargeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs to the weight of doubletargeted PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs.

Fabrication of PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs
Firstly, 3.5mg PTX and 125mg mPEG-PLGA
were dissolved into 5ml dichloromethane solution.
Then 200uL 0.5mg/ml F68 solution was added into the

60 sec) or UTMD conditions (power, 1 W/cm2; exposure
time, 60 sec; SonoVue volume ratio, 2:5) were used.
Subsequently, the medium in the wells were removed
and 0.2 ml fresh medium of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added
to every well and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The culture
medium was then removed from the wells and replaced
with 0.2 ml dimethyl sulfoxide. Following agitation of
the 96-well plates for 15-20 min, the absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a Model 680
Microplate Reader from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules,
CA, USA).

A dialysis-bag (MWCO=3500), in which 1ml
PTX-mPEG-PLGA NPs aqueous was sealed, was
immersed into 19ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
solution containing 1moL/L sodium salicylate (pH=5.0,
6.5, 7.4) and shaked at 37°C. At predetermined time,
200 μL sample of the dialysis bag were taken out and
fresh medium of the same volume was added. PTX
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution was used as
control. PTX concentrations of samples were determined
by HPLC and release quantity of PTX was calculated to
draw the cumulative release-time curves. PTX release
efficiency was determined by the ratio of the PTX
amount released into solution to the total amount of PTX
in the double-targeted NPs.

Respectively two dimensional ultrasound and
ultrasound contrast enhanced imaging of NPs in
vitro
Philips IE33 was used and the probe was L11-3.
Firstly, NPs powder were respectively put into Eppendorf
tube (concentration: 17mg/ml) filled with degassed water,
sealed and vibrated fully. The outer surfaces of the tube
were covered with ultrasound coupling agent to keep
no air between the tubes and the transducer. Ultrasound
contrast enhanced images was taken immediately and
SonoVue was observed as comparison.

US and UTMD condition optimization
Human Pancreatic cancer CFAPC-1 cells were
incubated in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium
(IMDM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin
and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C in a humidified
condition with 5% CO2.
A therapeutic US machine (Physiomed, Erlangen,
Germany) was used, on which some conditions
were fixed as followed: the frequency of the probe
was 1MHz, duty cycle:1:5. According to US power,
US irradiation time, SonoVue volume ratio, diverse
experiment conditions were designed into 20 groups
(Chart 1). Encapsulating RhB double-targeted NPs
were added into CFAPC-1 cells and incubated for 2hr
under the 20 setting conditions respectively. Then the
cells were trypsinized and collected to be analyzed by
flowcytometry (FCM).

Respectively two dimensional ultrasound and
ultrasound contrast enhanced imaging of NPs
and SonoVue in vivo
The CFAPC-1 orthotopic tumor was set up by
injecting 20μl CFAPC-1 cells spension (5×107/ml) into
the pancreas of BALB/c nude mouse.
Siemens Sequaio512 and LOGIQ E9 were used and
the corresponding probes were respectively 15L8W-S
and ML6-14. SonoVue degassed aqueous(0.2 ml,
concentration: 17 mg/ml) and NPs degassed aqueous
(0.2 ml, concentration: 17 mg/ml) were quickly injected
into rabbit ear veins respectively, in the meanwhile,
ultrasound contrast imagines of the rabbit right kidney
were real-time observed and recorded. In the same way,
0.1 ml NPs and 0.1 ml SonoVue were quickly injected
into tail vein of orthotropic pancreas tumors loaded nude
mice respectively. At the same time, ultrasound contrast
enhanced imaging of superficial was also real-time
observed and recorded.

Cell uptake observed by confocal laser scanning
microscope (CLSM)
CFAPC-1 cells were incubated in confocal dishs
for 2 hrs with RbB-mPEG-PLGA NPs and RbB-doubletargeted NPs respectively. The US or UTMD condition
was optimized above. The cells were fixed and dyed
before viewed through CLSM.

Statistics
Measurement data were displayed with x̄±sd.
Statistical tests were processed using the Student’s t-test,
and the statistical difference for significance between
the experimental and control groups was analyzed using
SPSS19.0 software. The statistical significance was
determined at p values < 0.05.

The cellular cytotoxicity of the NPs was determined
by MTT assay. CFAPC-1 cells (1×105/well) were cultured
in 96-well plates for 24 h. Then the cells were treated with
different conditions and incubated for 24 and 48 h at 37°C.
The fixed probe frequency was 1 MHz, duty cycle was
20%. The optimal US (power, 1 W/cm2; exposure time,
