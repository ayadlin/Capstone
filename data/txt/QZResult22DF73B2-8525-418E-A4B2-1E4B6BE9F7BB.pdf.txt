mediates activation of subsequent cell cycle progression inhibitors,
resulting in a G2-M checkpoint (5). The ATM kinase cascades
also induce phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which is involved
in both the G1-S and G2-M checkpoints (3). Phosphorylation of
the histone variant H2AX at Ser139 (commonly known as gH2AX),
which recruits DNA DSB repair proteins to the sites of the breaks,
is also activated via ATM (6). Cells without ATM function
cannot efficiently activate checkpoint responses to IR-induced
DNA strand breaks and are hypersensitive to IR treatment (7–9).
Moreover, tumor cells are generally more susceptible than
normal cells to IR treatment in part because they frequently
are defective in their DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions (10).
In addition to IR, DNA DSBs can be induced by radiomimetic
enediynes, which generate free radicals that abstract hydrogen
atoms from the backbone of DNA while undergoing a Bergman
cycloaromatization reaction (11). There are two major groups of
enediynes: the protein chromophore family, which includes neocarzinostatin and C-1027, where the chromophore is surrounded
by a hydrophobic protein, and the chromophore enediynes, such
as calicheamicin, which lack a protein conjugate (12). Unlike
IR, which induces f100 single-strand breaks (SSB) for every
DSB, enediynes induce lower ratios of SSBs to DSBs, about 5:1
for neocarzinostatin and 2:1 of DSBs for C-1027 (13–15). In
addition, unlike IR, which induces random DNA breaks,
enediynes induce preferential DNA damage at distinct sequences
that differ for each drug (11). Despite the diversity of enediynes,
a common characteristic is the rapid induction of DNA breaks
under cell-free and cellular conditions (16). The induction of
cellular DNA breaks correlates well with cytotoxicity, and cells
usually respond to enediyne-induced damage as they would to
IR-induced damage (17–19). For example, treatment of cells with
enediynes typically results in ATM-dependent activation of DNA
damage response proteins accompanied by G2-M cell cycle
arrest (20–23).
Recent studies have shown that, unlike IR and other radiomimetics, cells treated with the enediyne C-1027 can robustly
activate damage responses in the absence of ATM (24, 25). The
mechanism responsible for the divergence between the damage
responses of C-1027-treated cells and those treated with IR or
another radiomimetic is currently unknown. Whether the uniqueness of C-1027 extends to analogues has not been tested because
the synthesis of protein chromophore enediynes by traditional
chemistry is limited by complexity of the chromophore as well as
an inability to recreate the apoprotein.
Recently, a breakthrough in C-1027 biosynthesis and engineering has allowed the generation of novel C-1027 analogues by

Abstract
The radiomimetic enediyne C-1027 induces almost exclusively
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and is extremely cytotoxic.
Unique among radiomimetics, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) is dispensable for cellular responses to C-1027-induced
DNA damage. This study explores the biological activity of
three recently bioengineered C-1027 analogues: 700-desmethylC-1027 (desmethyl), 20¶-deschloro-C-1027 (deschloro), and 22¶deshydroxy-C-1027 (deshydroxy). Each compound maintains
the characteristic ability of radiomimetics to cleave DNA in
cell-free systems, varying in activity from 2-fold (deschloro) to
55-fold (desmethyl) less than C-1027. The induction of cellular
DNA breaks based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis, comet
analysis, and ;H2AX activation was in the same rank order as
cell-free DNA break induction, although the amount of breaks
induced by desmethyl is greatly reduced compared with the
other analogues. Despite the disparity in inducing DNA DSBs,
all of the analogues produced G2-M cell cycle arrest and
activated DNA DSB damage response proteins, such as p53Ser15 and Chk2-Thr68, at concentrations in concordance with
their ability to inhibit cell growth. Interestingly, of the three
analogues, only the desmethyl-induced DNA damage response
was similar to C-1027, as it did not cause hypersensitive cell
growth inhibition in the absence of ATM nor require the
kinase to phosphorylate p53 or Chk2. These findings show that
simple modifications of the chromophore of C-1027 can result
in varied induction of, and cellular response to, DNA DSBs.

Introduction
Induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) by ionizing
radiation (IR) is often used as a treatment option in cancer
therapy. In response to DNA DSBs, cells activate DNA damage
response pathways to impede progression of the cell cycle,
allowing cells additional time to either repair the damaged DNA
or activate apoptotic pathways (1–3). Following IR treatment, the
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is activated, thereby
initiating kinase cascades (4). For example, ATM activates the
transducer kinase Chk2, which, when phosphorylated at Thr68,

cell-free plasmid DNA based on forms conversion analysis. Plasmid DNA was treated with either a standard enediyne [neocarzinostatin (NCS ) or C-1027] or one of the
analogues for 30 min at 37jC. The DNA was then electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide to assess conversion of
the forms of the plasmid DNA from superhelical form I to circular nicked form II or linear form III DNA. C, each enediyne induces conversion of form I to II or III
in a concentration-dependent manner. The percentages of the three forms relative to the total DNA are plotted as a function of drug concentration for neocarzinostatin,

In this study, we have systematically evaluated the three novel
analogues in comparison with the parent C-1027 for their ability
to induce DNA strand breaks into cell-free and cellular DNA,
verifying that these compounds maintain this quintessential properties of enediynes (11). Analogue-induced cell growth inhibition
and interference with cell cycle progression were also determined
along with the ability to activate the DNA damage response proteins

DNA damage responses are ATM dependent or independent.

Streptomyces globisporus (26). The C-1027 chromophore is derived
biosynthetically from four basic biochemical units: a benzoxazolinate, a deoxyamino hexose, a h-amino acid, and an enediyne
core (26). Systematical introduction of permutations into the
genes that encode the biosynthesis of these units resulted in the
isolation of recombinant strains that produce various C-1027
analogues. For example, inactivation of the sgcC or the sgcC3
gene, which encode a hydroxylase and halogenase, respectively,
yielded the mutant strains that produce the deshydroxy and
deschloro analogues, generating structural variations at the
h-amino acid moiety of the C-1027 chromophore (Fig. 1A;
refs. 26, 27). Meanwhile, inactivation of sgcD4, which encodes a
methyltransferase, afforded a mutant strain that produces the
desmethyl analogue, exemplifying structural alteration at the ben-

Chk2-Thr68 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), as well as anti-h-actin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence and quantitated using a Personal Densitometer SI
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and ImageQuant software.
Immunofluorescent staining. After drug treatment, cells were permeabilized and washed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by fixation
with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The extraction-resistant gH2AX was stained
with anti-gH2AX primary antibody and fluorescein-conjugated secondary
antibodies. Hoechst 33342 (2 Amol/L) was used to stain DNA. gH2AX foci
were examined using an Olympus BX40 microscope with a Regita Exi digital
camera and Image-Pro Plus software.
Flow cytometry. Exponentially growing cells were drug treated continuously for 24 h, rinsed with PBS, and harvested. The cells were fixed in
70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide solution (0.1% propidium iodide,
0.1% sodium citrate, 0.4% NP40, and 0.2 mg/mL RNase A), and analyzed by
flow cytometry on a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA)
using WinList software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME).

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Fermentation, production, isolation, and purification of
C-1027, desmethyl, deschloro, and deshydroxy were carried out as described
previously (26, 27). The yields for C-1027 from the S. globisporus wild-type
strain, desmethyl analogue from the S. globisporus SB1009 strain (i.e.,
DsgcD4 mutant),5 deschloro analogue from the S. globisporus SB1008 strain
(i.e., DsgcC3 mutant; ref. 27), and deshydroxy analogue from the S.
globisporus SB1006 strain (i.e., DsgcC mutant; ref. 26) were estimated to be
60, 20, 60, and 60 mg/L, respectively. Neocarzinostatin was a gift from
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Syracuse, NY). All compounds were stored at
200 Amol/L in double-distilled water at 20jC.
Cells. Isogenic ATM-null (AT169A) and ATM-restored (YZ510B) human
fibroblast cell lines (gift of Drs. P. Lu and Y. Shiloh) were grown at 37jC and
5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus
50 Ag/mL hygromycin to maintain selective pressure on the transfected
constructs (28). All experiments were done with the YZ510B cell line unless
otherwise specified.
Forms conversion. pBR322 plasmid DNA (100 ng; New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was incubated with C-1027, desmethyl, deschloro,
deshydroxy, or neocarzinostatin in 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5) for 30 min at
37jC. DTT (0.5 mmol/L) was included only in the neocarzinostatin
reaction buffer as an activating agent, as we found it was not necessary
for C-1027 (29) or for these analogues (data not shown). Samples were
electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and then the gels were stained with
ethidium bromide, photographed using the Gel Doc XR (Bio-Rad Corp.,
Hercules, CA), and analyzed by ImageQuant software (Molecular
Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ).
Growth inhibition assay. Cells were seeded at 2.5  105 per well in sixwell dishes and drug treated 24 h later. Following a 3-day incubation, dishes
were washed and cells were counted by Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter,
Inc., Fullerton, CA). Cell growth inhibition was calculated by comparing the
number of treated to nontreated control cells.
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Cells were treated with drugs for 2 h,
washed, and resuspended in 0.5% low melting temperature agarose, poured
into a plug former, and kept at 4jC until solidified. Plugs containing
approximately 3  105 cells were incubated with 1 mg/mL proteinase K in
lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris, 2% sodium sarcosinate, 0.5 mol/L EDTA (pH
8.0)] for 24 h at 50jC. The plugs were loaded into wells of a 0.8% agarose gel.
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was conducted in 0.5 Tris borate/EDTA for
18 h at 200 V using a ChefDR apparatus (Bio-Rad), and damage was
quantitated using ImageQuant software.
Comet analysis. Following a 30-min drug treatment, cells were
resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1  107/mL and then analyzed
by Comet as described elsewhere with minor modifications (30). Briefly,
cells were diluted into low melting temperature agarose and placed on an
agarose-covered slide for 2 h at 4jC. The slide was then immersed in
alkaline lysis buffer overnight at 4jC and then placed in electrophoresis
buffer for 20 min before electrophoresis at 27 V for 25 min at 4jC. The slides
were then placed in 0.4 mol/L Tris (pH 7.5) thrice for 5 min followed by
immersion in 100% methanol and then ethanol. The slides were dried and
stained with 15 Ag/mL ethidium bromide, and DNA damage was assessed
as described (30).
Immunoblotting. Cells were incubated with drugs at 37jC for 1 h,
harvested, and washed in PBS. Total cellular extracts were prepared by
incubating cells on ice in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride,
1 mmol/L sodium o-vanadate, 1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors] for 15 min. The cell
lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein content was determined
using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were
electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were probed with primary
antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase. The primary antibodies used were anti-gH2AX (Upstate,
Charlottesville, VA), anti-phosphorylated p53-Ser15 and anti-phosphorylated

Results
C-1027 analogues cleave cell-free DNA. An intrinsic property
of enediynes is their ability to cleave DNA in a cell-free system. The
C-1027 analogues (Fig. 1A) were compared with the parent
compound and another protein chromophore enediyne, neocarzinostatin, for their ability to cleave an isolated supercoiled
plasmid DNA. In this assay, supercoiled DNA ( form I) can be
converted to a nicked circular form ( form II) by a SSB, whereas a
DSB results in a full-length linear duplex ( form III) as shown by
neocarzinostatin and C-1027 (Fig. 1B). The rapid increase in the
appearance of form III DNA after treatment with C-1027, but not
neocarzinostatin, indicates that a high percentage of the total C1027-induced DNA breaks were DSBs (Fig. 1B and C), consistent
with the observation that C-1027 induces primarily DSBs whereas
neocarzinostatin induces a mixture of SSBs and DSBs (29). Similar
to the parent compound, the three analogues also rapidly convert
the plasmid into form III DNA, indicating that they also induce a
high percentage of DSBs (Fig. 1B and C).6 With regard to activity,
each of the analogues was able to induce cell-free DNA breaks, with
a potency of approximately 55X, 2X, and 20X for desmethyl,
deschloro, and deshydroxy, respectively, where X is the concentration of C-1027 required to reduce the amount of form I DNA by
50% (Fig. 1C).
At very high drug concentrations that result in extensive DNA
cleavage, deschloro and deshydroxy induce mobility retardation in
all three forms of the plasmid DNA (Fig. 1B). The levels at which
the mobility changes first appear are 600 and 2,000 nmol/L for
deschloro and deshydroxy, respectively (Fig. 1B), and the mobility
retardation increased in a concentration-dependent manner for
those analogues (data not shown). Furthermore, the desmethyl
compound also induced mobility retardation in a concentrationdependent manner, starting f14,000 nmol/L (data not shown).
This binding may be related to a reversible DNA interaction with
the postactivated chromophore that has previously been described
for the parent at very high concentrations (32), but a complete

We also examined the ability of the analogues to induce abasic sites, which are a
common lesion induced by enediynes, including C-1027 (14). To measure abasic sites,
the drug-treated DNA was incubated with 100 mmol/L putrescine for 1 h at 37jC,
which results in conversion of abasic sites to DNA strand breaks (31). Similar to the
parent compound, putrescine treatment resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in the
amount of DSBs induced by each of the analogues, suggesting that they all induce a
similar ratio of abasic sites to direct DNA DSBs (data not shown).

C-1027 analogue treatment of cells induces primarily DNA
DSBs. C-1027 has a SSB/DSB ratio of approximately 2:1, so neutral
pulsed field gel electrophoresis is a suitable measure of total DNA
breaks (15). However, because the ratio of SSB/DSB produced by
the analogues in cells is unknown, we also determined total DNA
breaks (SSB and/or DSBs) based on alkaline comet analysis
(Fig. 3B). In the comet assay, the nucleus can be seen as the head of
the comet, and on alkaline electrophoresis, DNA that was damaged
by either a SSB or DSB migrates out of the nucleus, forming a tail.
Smaller, more rapidly migrating DNA fragments move further away
from the nucleus than do less damaged fragments so that the
amount of DNA damage is proportional to the length of the comet
tail. After treatment with C-1027, deschloro, or deshydroxy, the
total DNA breaks were consistent with the pulsed field analysis
(DSBs alone), as the comet tails formed after an initial limited
amount of damage and then the comet tails lengthen in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Similarly, treatment with
the desmethyl analogue also was consistent with the pulsed field
study, as it resulted in an initial limited amount of damage at
50 nmol/L, which did not seem to increase even at 800 nmol/L
(Fig. 3B). Thus, the disparity of cellular DNA DSBs induced by

Figure 2. C-1027 analogues induce cell growth inhibition. After 3 d of treatment
with C-1027, an analogue or neocarzinostatin at 37jC, the percentage growth

the control at each drug concentration. Inset, IC50 value for each compound

work-up of thermodynamic DNA-binding properties would be
necessary to determine this conclusively.
C-1027 analogues inhibit cellular growth. To determine
whether the analogues are active in a cellular environment, we
tested their ability to induce cell growth inhibition. Cells were
treated with C-1027 analogues, and growth inhibition was
measured after 3 days of continuous drug treatment. The IC50s
for growth arrest were 24 pmol/L for C-1027, 1,412 pmol/L for
desmethyl, 72 pmol/L for deschloro, and 174 pmol/L for
deshydroxy, which is approximately 60-, 3-, and 7-fold higher than
C-1027, respectively (Fig. 2). The enediyne neocarzinostatin itself,
a potent inhibitor of cell growth inhibition, was included in this
study and showed that even the weakest C-1027 analogue retains
considerable potency in cells.
C-1027 analogues induce cellular DNA DSBs. Neutral pulsed
field gel electrophoresis, which provides a direct measure of DNA
DSBs by fractionating DNA according to molecular weight, was
used to test the ability of C-1027 and the analogues to induce
cellular DNA breaks. In this assay, undamaged cellular DNA is
typically too large to enter the gel and is retained in the wells.
However, induction of a small amount of DNA DSBs results in a
band of high molecular weight (HMW) material at the top of the
gel (Fig. 3A, arrow), although further induction of DSBs reduces this
band to a range of smaller and therefore more rapidly migrating
pieces of DNA that resolve as a smear below the HMW band.
Treatment of cells with the deschloro or deshydroxy analogue for
1 h showed a DNA cleavage pattern comparable with 1 nmol/L
C-1027 (Fig. 3A), although as in the cell-free DNA study higher drug
concentrations, 8 and 36 times, respectively, were needed.
Interestingly, although desmethyl initially resulted in limited
amounts of DNA leaving the well, the amount of DNA did not
increase significantly with drug concentration nor was DNA
migrating below the HMW band (Fig. 3A). Thus, even at the
highest concentration (800 nmol/L), desmethyl-induced DSBs were
far less than what was observed with 1 nmol/L C-1027 even if
normalized for cytotoxicity. To test if the low levels of DNA DSBs
were a result of a slower rate of DNA cleavage by the desmethyl
analogue, increased treatment times of up to 4 h were examined.
However, the proportion of damaged DNA remained similar to that
of the parent (data not shown).

Figure 3. A, C-1027 analogues induce cellular DNA DSBs. The ability of
C-1027 analogues to cleave cellular DNA was measured by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis. DNA DSBs were measured after treatment of YZ510B cells for
1 h at 37jC with either C-1027 or an analogue over a range of concentrations
that was expected to induce similar damage profiles. Following pulsed field
gel electrophoresis to size fractionate the DNA, the gels were stained with
ethidium bromide to visualize the DNA that entered the lane versus total DNA
(DNA in the lane + DNA in the well). Arrow, HMW band of DNA entering the

After drug treatment, YZ510B cells were harvested and placed on a microscope
slide, lysed, and electrophoresed, and after addition of ethidium bromide,
DNA comets were detected by fluorescence microscopy.

Responses to C-1027 Analogue-Induced DNA Damage

the initial focalization of gH2AX that appeared at the lower
concentration (Fig. 4B). Overall, the induction of gH2AX is
consistent with the measurements of DNA DSBs made by pulsed
field analysis (Figs. 3A and 4).
C-1027 analogue treatment induces cell cycle checkpoints.
Typically, cell cycle checkpoints are activated to impede cell cycle
progression following induction of DNA damage. At low concentrations, C-1027, similar to IR and other radiomimetic treatments,
induces a strong G2-M arrest 24 h after treatment (Fig. 5A; refs.
3, 21). To test if C-1027 analogues also induce G2-M arrest, cells
were treated with equicytotoxic concentrations of C-1027, desmethyl, deschloro, or deshydroxy. Based on fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis, the desmethyl and deschloro analogues induce
a strong G2-M block. Although deshydroxy also blocks cells at G2M, a somewhat greater proportion of cells resided in G1 compared
with the other compounds (Fig. 5A).

Figure 4. A, C-1027 analogues induce gH2AX phosphorylation. YZ510B cells
were treated with approximately equicytotoxic concentrations of either C-1027
or an analogue at 37jC for 0.5 h, and the cellular extracts were analyzed by
Western blotting. Immunoblots were then probed with an antibody specific for
phosphorylated gH2AX. B, C-1027 analogues induce gH2AX focalization. Cells
were grown on microscope slide coverslips before treatment at the conditions
described above. Cells were then washed in PBS, fixed with formaldehyde,
and probed with a monoclonal antibody against gH2AX. A fluorescein-labeled
secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342 were used to detect the foci and
nucleus, respectively.

desmethyl is not because it is inducing a higher ratio of SSBs to
DSBs in a cellular environment.
C-1027 analogue treatment induces cellular DNA damage
responses. Similar to IR or other radiomimetics, treatment of
cells with C-1027 has previously shown that H2AX is phosphorylated to gH2AX and recruited to sites of DSBs (33). To test
whether treatment of cells with the C-1027 analogues also
induces gH2AX, cells were treated with approximately equicytotoxic concentrations of C-1027 or an analogue for 30 min and
analyzed by Western blotting. At low levels of C-1027 treatment
(0.1 nmol/L), gH2AX is detected and increases in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 4A). At low, approximately equicytotoxic
levels of deschloro or deshydroxy, gH2AX is activated to a similar
extent as the parent compound and the amount of activation
increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A ).
Treatment with a low equicytotoxic level of desmethyl showed
an initial activation of gH2AX, but the level did not increase with
concentration (Fig. 4A).
Because gH2AX localization is necessary for recruitment of DNA
repair proteins, such as 53BP1, NBS1, and BRCA1, to DNA DSBs,
focalization of gH2AX after analogue treatment was also examined
(34). To test for gH2AX focalization, cells were treated for 30 min
with the lowest and highest concentration of each drug used in
Fig. 4A and analyzed by microscopic immunofluorescence. After
treatment with low, approximately equicytotoxic concentrations of
C-1027, gH2AX foci were easily detectable, although the high level
of C-1027 showed a dramatic increase in foci intensity (Fig. 4B).
Similarly, using the low, approximately equicytotoxic concentration
of the three C-1027 analogues, each induced a modest level of
gH2AX foci similar to C-1027. When the concentrations of the
analogues were increased to correspond to higher levels of C-1027,
the deschloro and deshydroxy analogues also showed a dramatic
increase in the intensity of gH2AX foci, whereas the intensity of
the desmethyl-induced gH2AX foci did not increase notably from

compartments were determined using WinList software. B, C-1027 analogues
activate the damage response proteins p53 and Chk2 in proportion to their
cytotoxicity. YZ510B cells were treated with either C-1027 or an analogue
for 1 h at 37jC, and the cellular extracts were analyzed by Western blotting.
Immunoblots were then probed with an antibody specific for phosphorylated

a concentration-dependent increase of p53-Ser15 phosphorylation
(Fig. 5B). These results show that all three C-1027 analogues induce
cell cycle arrest at G2-M and robustly activate cell cycle checkpoint
proteins (Fig. 5).
DNA DSB damage responses to C-1027 analogue treatment
vary in their ATM dependence. Cells typically activate DNA DSB
damage response proteins through an ATM-dependent kinase
cascade after treatment with IR and radiomimetics, such as
calicheamicin and neocarzinostatin (22, 23, 35). However, we have
previously shown that, in response to C-1027-induced damage,
ATM-null cells can phosphorylate both Chk2-Thr68 and p53-Ser15
as robustly as ATM wild-type cells (24, 25), a result that is
recapitulated in Fig. 6A. Similarly, ATM-null cells treated with
desmethyl phosphorylate Chk2-Thr68 and p53-Ser15 as readily as
ATM wild-type cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, treatment of ATM-null
cells with deschloro resulted in a notable decrease in the activation
of both Chk2 and p53 (Fig. 6A) and a very large decrease in the
phosphorylation of these proteins after deshydroxy treatment
(Fig. 6A).
The relative ratio of Chk2 and p53 phosphorylation between
ATM wild-type and ATM-null cells was determined by dividing
the phosphorylation level of each protein in the wild-type by the
level of the ATM null in response to each drug. The ratio of
C-1027 of f1 is indicative for ATM independence with regard to
phosphorylation of both Chk2 and p53 (Fig. 6B). Similarly, desmethyl treatment also activates these DNA DSB damage response
proteins independently of ATM as it also resulted in a ratio of f1
for both proteins (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the relative ratio of neocarzinostatin (f2) was determined to use as a reference point
for a typical ATM-dependent damage response (Fig. 6B ).
Deschloro treatment also resulted in a ratio of f2, establishing
that, like neocarzinostatin, this analogue induces ATM-dependent
damage responses (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, in response to treatment with deshydroxy, a ratio of 4 was determined for both
proteins, suggesting that this agent induces more extreme ATMdependent damage responses in comparison with other radiomimetics (Fig. 6B).
Because cells lacking ATM are unable to completely induce
DNA damage responses to DNA DSBs induced by IR and
radiomimetics (except C-1027), they are more susceptible to
growth inhibition or cell death (4). We therefore tested whether
hypersensitivity to growth inhibition would vary according to the
ATM dependence of checkpoint activation. The IC50s for growth
inhibition of ATM wild-type and ATM-null cells were measured
after treatment with C-1027 analogues. The IC50 for the ATM
wild-type was divided by the IC50 for ATM-null cells to determine
a hypersensitivity ratio. The ratio of C-1027 of f1 is indicative
for ATM independence with regard to cell growth inhibition
(Fig. 6C). Similar to C-1027, the desmethyl analogue also has a
hypersensitivity ratio of f1 (Fig. 6C). Ratios >1, such as that
induced by neocarzinostatin (f2.4), are typical of DNA damage
responses that are dependent on ATM. Treatment with either
deschloro or deshydroxy resulted in cellular hypersensitivity with
regard to cell growth inhibition with ratios of 2.2 and 3.6,
respectively (Fig. 6C). Thus, the growth inhibition data are
consistent with the ATM-dependent activation of DNA damage
response proteins Chk2 and p53. Therefore, both deschloro and
deshydroxy act like IR and other radiomimetics in that they induce
a classic ATM-dependent damage response, whereas desmethyl, like
C-1027, induces an ATM-independent damage response to DNA
DSBs (Fig. 6).

Figure 6. C-1027 and desmethyl induce ATM-independent DNA damage
responses, whereas deschloro and deshydroxy do not. A, AT169A (ATM null)
and YZ510B (ATM wild-type) cells were treated with equicytotoxic
concentrations of either C-1027 or an analogue for 1 h at 37jC, and the cellular
extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblots were then probed
with an antibody specific for phosphorylated Chk2-Thr68 or p53-Ser15. B, the
protein band in each lane was normalized to a loading control (h-actin) and then
quantitated using ImageQuant software. The fold difference between these
values was used to determine the ratio of Chk2-Thr68 and p53-Ser15 activation
between ATM wild-type and ATM-null cells. The values of at least three
independent experiments were analyzed for each drug. C, cell growth inhibition
of the ATM wild-type and ATM-null cells was similar for C-1027 and desmethyl
but not for deschloro, deshydroxy, or neocarzinostatin. After 3 d of drug
treatment, the IC50 was calculated based on concentration of drug required to
reduce cell growth by 50%. The fold differences in the IC50s were used to
determine the ratio of growth inhibition between ATM wild-type and ATM-null
cells.

Activation of the G2-M checkpoint in response to DNA DSBs
involves the activation of damage response proteins, including
phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 (2, 3). At low equicytotoxic
concentrations of drug treatment, modest levels of Chk2-Thr68
phosphorylation were observed for all the compounds (Fig. 5B).
The amount of Chk2-Thr68 phosphorylation increased in a
concentration-dependent manner even after treatment with the
desmethyl analogue, which did not induce gH2AX in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 4 and 5B).
Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, another downstream DNA
damage response protein, is involved in both G1-S and G2-M arrest
(3). Phosphorylation of p53-Ser15 was consistent with that of Chk2Thr68 after treatment with C-1027 or desmethyl, deschloro, and
deshydroxy, as low equicytotoxic concentrations result in modest
levels of p53 activation (Fig. 5B). In addition, similar to Chk2-Thr68,
increasing drug concentrations of each of the analogues resulted in

Responses to C-1027 Analogue-Induced DNA Damage

showed a corresponding increase in the amount of gH2AX phosphorylation and focalization; however, desmethyl did not (Figs. 3A
and 4). DNA DSBs induced by IR and radiomimetics increase
linearly with drug concentration, so the finding that desmethylinduced DNA DSBs do not increase with drug concentration is
atypical (29).
Analysis of cellular DNA breaks by alkaline comet, which detects
total DNA strand breaks (DSBs + SSBs), was found to be consistent
with the neutral pulsed field gel analysis and gH2AX data (Fig. 3B).
Therefore, the drugs all induce primarily DSBs under both cell-free
and cellular conditions (Figs. 1C and 3). This is consistent with
another enediyne, calicheamicin, which also produces primarily
DSBs under cellular conditions, mimicking what is observed in cellfree systems (17). Thus, the unusual mechanism of action of the
desmethyl compound is likely not explained by it producing a
greater amount of SSBs in cells.
The cytotoxicity of the analogues was C-1027>deschloro>deshydroxy>desmethyl, which is in the same rank order as their ability to
induce DNA DSBs (Fig. 2). This is unsurprising, as, regardless of
differences in the DNA damage induced by treatment with IR or a
radiomimetic, such as C-1027, calicheamicin, neocarzinostatin, and
macromomycin/auromomycin, it is the induction of DSBs that best
correlates with the induction of cytotoxicity (17–19, 29). However,
the relationship between desmethyl-induced DSBs and cytotoxicity
is more complex, as, even when normalized for cytotoxicity,
desmethyl failed to induce a similar level of DNA DSBs in comparison with the other analogues (Fig. 3A). Moreover, treatment of
cells with increasing amounts of desmethyl resulted in an increase
in cellular cytotoxicity (Fig. 2), yet the amount of DSBs induced
did not increase accordingly (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, the desmethyl
compound is still extremely potent at inducing growth inhibition,
as its IC50 was an order of magnitude lower than neocarzinostatin
(Fig. 2). Furthermore, desmethyl, like the other analogues, induces
a G2-M cell cycle block at low equicytotoxic concentrations7
(Fig. 5A) despite its limited ability to induce cellular DNA DSBs.
Therefore, it is possible that the cellular cytotoxicity and cell cycle
block induced by desmethyl treatment is not limited to DSB
induction but could involve other mechanisms. For example,
some enediynes can also cleave RNA, albeit at concentrations well
above those needed to cleave DNA (42). Thus, perhaps certain
modifications on the benzoxazolinate moiety (desmethyl analogue) of the C-1027 chromophore increase its affinity for nonDNA targets.
Consistent with the activation of a G2-M cell cycle block, it was
not surprising that each analogue induces Chk2-Thr68 and p53Ser15. However, these proteins are also thought to be increasing by
phosphorylated as the level of DNA DSBs increases (23, 24).
Interestingly, although DNA DSBs do not increase in a concentration-dependent manner after desmethyl treatment, Chk2 and p53
activation was concentration dependent (Figs. 3A and 5B).
Certainly, phosphorylation of p53 can occur in response to a
variety of cellular stresses besides strand breaks, such as that
caused by UV irradiation or hypoxia (43). However, phosphorylation of Chk2, like gH2AX, is considered to be more specific to the
cellular response to DNA DSBs (23, 44). Yet, unlike gH2AX, Chk2

Discussion
This study examined the DNA cleavage activity of, and cellular
DNA damage responses to, three biosynthetic analogues of the
enediyne C-1027, a potent inducer of DNA DSBs (14). Although the
biological activity of truncated versions of the enediynes calicheamicin and esperamicin has previously been characterized (36, 37),
this is the first study to examine single substitutions on an
enediyne chromophore. All of the analogues maintain the ability to
cleave cell-free DNA as measured by forms conversion analysis of
drug-treated superhelical plasmid DNA (Fig. 1B). C-1027 was the
most potent followed by deschloro, deshydroxy, and, finally,
desmethyl, with cleavage activity varying by up to 55-fold.
Furthermore, the DNA cleavage activities compare favorably with
the truncated calicheamicin and esperamicin analogues, which
were 10- to 1,000-fold weaker than their respective parent
compounds (36, 37).
Substitutions on the C-1027 chromophore may alter the
location of the biradical within the DNA minor groove, which
previous studies have shown can change not only the potency of
a compound but also the ratio of SSBs/DSBs induced (32, 38). The
proportion of SSBs to DSBs induced by each enediyne are related
to the efficiency of the two radicals in abstracting hydrogen from
DNA. For example, the biradicals of enediynes that induce a high
proportion of DSBs, such as C-1027 and calicheamicin, are
positioned in a conformation favorable for each radical to
abstract hydrogen from the DNA backbone (39). In contrast,
neocarzinostatin induces primarily SSBs because one radical is
positioned such that abstraction of hydrogen from other sources,
such as water, is more favorable than from the DNA sugar
(40, 41). Similar to the parent compound, all three analogues
maintain a low ratio of cell-free DNA SSBs/DSBs because form III
DNA is readily observable in drug-treated lanes, whereas an
abundant amount of form I DNA still remains, implying that the
chromophore substitutions induce little, if any, changes in the
positioning of the biradical (Fig. 1C).
Neutral pulsed field gel analysis of DNA isolated from drugtreated cells provides direct evidence that all of the analogues were
also capable of inducing DNA DSBs in cells. Based on the
appearance of the HMW band of DNA (Fig. 3A, arrow), which
appears when sufficient DNA DSBs are induced to allow the DNA
to enter the gel, the rank order of activity was consistent with the
cell-free experiments. Similar to other radiomimetics, increasing
levels of deschloro and deshydroxy treatment continued to reduce
DNA size, resulting in a range of lower molecular weight material
that appears as a smear below the HMW band within each lane
(Fig. 3A; ref. 29). Because the cellular DNA strand scission activity
of these two analogues reflects their strand scission activity under
cell-free conditions, the uptake and stability of these compounds
are likely similar in cells.
However, unlike C-1027 and the other analogues, increasing
concentrations of desmethyl did not result in further degradation
of the HMW DNA band (Fig. 3A). In fact, even at longer treatment
times, or levels >100-fold higher (2,000 nmol/L) than those
expected to result in sufficient DSBs to reduce the HMW band,
we found no evidence of further DNA damage (data not shown).
Consistent with the pulsed field measurements, all of the analogues induced detectable gH2AX phosphorylation and focalization at concentrations even lower than those at which the HMW
band was first detected (Figs. 3A and 4). Similarly, increasing
concentrations of C-1027, as well as deschloro and deshydroxy,

Distinctly from C-1027 and from the other analogues, a notable G1 population
remained after deshydroxy treatment (Fig. 5A). Perhaps deshydroxy induces both G1-S
and G2-M arrest at approximately equal concentration of treatment as opposed to the
other analogues, which require 3- to 5-fold higher concentrations to activate the G1-S
checkpoint (data not shown; ref. 22).

in response to C-1027 treatment is consistent with the idea that
this radiomimetic induces cellular DNA ISCs in addition to DNA
DSBs (25).
Furthermore, if desmethyl treatment results in cellular DNA
ISCs, it would also help explain the ability of the analogue to
induce DNA damage response protein activation and cell growth
inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 2 and 5B)
without inducing a correlative increase in the amount of DNA
DSBs (Figs. 3A and 4). Whether DNA ISCs are induced in cells
by C-1027 and possibly by the other analogues is under study, as
well as the relative importance of cellular DNA ISCs versus DSBs
with regard to their reliance on ATM and ATR to activate DNA
damage responses. Selective modifications of the C-1027 chromophore will help define the structure-activity relationship of
the ATM-dependent and ATM-independent DNA damage response pathways.
Overall, the current work clearly showed that structural
permutations on the C-1027 chromophore have a profound effect
on the mode of action of the resultant C-1027 chromoprotein
complex. It further suggests that the location, not just the presence,
of a single modification to the C-1027 chromophore is important in
determining not only the ability of the drug to induce DNA DSBs
but also the ATM dependency of the cellular DNA damage
response. Experiments are in progress to produce additional
C-1027 analogues to further decipher the mechanism(s) of action of
the C-1027 family of antitumor antibiotics and their ability to
invoke unique cellular DNA damage responses.

was activated in a concentration-dependent manner after
desmethyl treatment (Figs. 4A and 5B). This is consistent with
recent studies that suggest that Chk2 can be activated in response
to cellular cytotoxicity, not just by DNA DSBs (8, 45, 46). Moreover,
for desmethyl, the observation that Chk2 and p53 are activated and
cell growth inhibition is induced in a concentration-dependent
manner without a correlating increasing of DNA DSBs is further
evidence that the DNA damage induced by desmethyl is likely not
limited to induction of DSBs.
The role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–like protein
kinase (PIKK) family member ATM in activating other DNA
damage response proteins and avoiding cellular hypersensitivity
to IR- or drug-induced DNA DSBs is well established (8, 24, 47).
The notable exception is that, in response to C-1027-induced DNA
damage, cells activate Chk2-Thr68 and p53-Ser15 similarly
regardless of ATM status, and cells lacking the kinase are not
hypersensitive to C-1027 treatment with regard to cell growth
inhibition or cell death (24, 25). Surprisingly, deschloro and
deshydroxy, which generate comparable amounts of DNA DSBs
with C-1027 when normalized for cytotoxicity, induce ATMdependent damage responses, behaving similar to IR and other
radiomimetics, such as neocarzinostatin (Fig. 6). In contrast,
desmethyl induces ATM-independent DNA damage responses, yet
it induced very low levels of DNA DSBs (Fig. 6). Thus, it is not yet
known how both C-1027, which is the most potent DNA DSB
inducer of the C-1027 family, and desmethyl, which is the
weakest, activate ATM-independent damage responses, whereas
the other analogues do not. Possibly, additional types of DNA
damage could trigger activation of DNA damage response
proteins in the absence of ATM. For example, under anaerobic
conditions in cell-free systems, C-1027 has been shown to induce
DNA interstrand cross-links (ISC), whereas other enediynes
(neocarzinostatin and calicheamicin) do not (41). The ability of
C-1027 to induce cellular DNA ISCs has not yet been studied.
However, cells use another PIKK family member, the ATM- and
Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, to induce damage responses to other
agents that induce ISCs (48). Thus, the observation that cells can
use ATR to activate Chk2 and p53 while avoiding hypersensitivity
