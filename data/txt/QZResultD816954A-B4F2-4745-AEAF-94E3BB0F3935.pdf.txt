Colon cancer incidence rates have
dropped 30% in the United States in the
last 10 years among adults aged 50 years
and older due to widespread use of
colonoscopy.
Meanwhile, researchers at Indiana University and Regenstrief
Institute in Indianapolis found that a new multitarget stool
DNA test not yet approved by the FDA detects 92.3% of
colon cancers, compared with 73.8% detected by the fecal
immunochemical test (FIT), the most common noninvasive
test.2 The study was conducted among nearly 10,000 averagerisk, asymptomatic men and women between the ages of 50 to
85 years from 90 sites across the United States.
The test is conducted on a single stool sample that is placed
directly into a container and mailed to a laboratory. It looks for
human DNA mutations in the stool as well as fecal blood.
Lead author Thomas Imperiale, MD, of Indiana University
notes that although screening reduces incidence and death, too few
people undergo screening. This noninvasive option, if approved
by the FDA, may encourage more people to be screened, he says.
The multitarget DNA test identiﬁed the most advanced
precancerous polyps nearly 70% of the time, compared with
approximately 45% of the time with FIT. However, the study
also found that the test produced more false-positive results
than FIT.

Twice-Daily Pill Could Treat
Leukemia

S

cientists have determined that a
twice-daily pill could turn chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into a highly
treatable disease. Researchers at Weill Cornell
Medical College (WCMC) in New York
City led a multinational team that published
their ﬁndings in The New England Journal of
Medicine.1
The study suggests that the pill, idelalisib,
may help patients avoid having to undergo
debilitating chemotherapy. Even if physicians
are unable to cure the cancer, idelalisib may
transform it into a chronic disease that can be
managed, according to lead investigator Richard Furman, MD,
a hematologist/oncologist at WCMC.
The randomized double-blinded study involved 19 medical
centers in 5 countries that tested a combination of 2 targeted
drugs for CLL. They compared rituximab and idelalisib against
rituximab and a placebo in 220 patients with CLL who could
not receive chemotherapy.
Those who received the ﬁrst combination went longer
without the disease worsening compared with those who received
only rituximab, which has been the standard of care. Six months
into the study, cancers in 93% of participants had not worsened,
compared with 46% of those in the group receiving rituximab
plus a placebo. At the same time, only 13% of patients treated
with rituximab alone responded positively to it, whereas 81%
of patients treated with rituximab plus idelalisib had a positive
response. Some 92% of patients in the combination group were
still alive one year after the study began, compared with 80% of
those who received rituximab only.
As a result of these encouraging ﬁndings, an independent
data-monitoring committee halted the study early (in October
2013) so that all participants could receive idelalisib. Dr.
Furman notes that strong responses to idelalisib were observed
even in those patients who did not respond to chemotherapy.
Previous studies demonstrated equally strong results in patients
who were newly diagnosed with CLL and in those who could
not tolerate chemotherapy.
Idelalisib is the second targeted drug that Dr. Furman
and his colleagues have tested that has shown strong results in
patients with CLL. A previous drug, ibrutinib, was tested in
a phase 2 clinical trial reported last July in The New England
Journal of Medicine. Both drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors
that work in diﬀerent targets in the same molecular pathway.
Ibrutinib was approved for use in mantle cell lymphoma last
year by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Cancer Roundtable to increase screening rates to 80% by
2018. They used incidence data from the NCI’s Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results program and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program of Cancer
Registries.
Data from 2001 to 2010 indicated that overall incidence
rates decreased by an average of 3.4% per year. Rates declined
by 3.9% per year among adults aged 50 years and older, but
increased by 1.1% per year among men and women aged
younger than 50 years. That increase only occurred for patients
with tumors occurring in the distal colon and rectum. Experts
attribute those types of tumors to a rise in obesity and poor diets.
The rate of decline was even higher in adults aged 65 years
and older, increasing from 3.6% per year from 2001 to 2008
to 7.2% per year from 2008 to 2010. The authors attribute
that signiﬁcant decline to higher rates of screening through
Medicare’s coverage of colonoscopies.
At the same time, mortality rates have declined rapidly over
the past decade. From 2001 to 2010, rates decreased by 3% per
year in both men and women, compared with declines of 2%
per year in the 1990s.
