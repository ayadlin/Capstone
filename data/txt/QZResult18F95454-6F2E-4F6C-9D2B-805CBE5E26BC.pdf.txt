Collections of Simultaneously Altered Genes as Biomarkers
of Cancer Cell Drug Response
David L. Masica and Rachel Karchin

Abstract
Computational analysis of cancer pharmacogenomics data has resulted in biomarkers predictive of drug
response, but the majority of response is not captured by current methods. Methods typically select single
biomarkers or groups of related biomarkers but do not account for response that is strictly dependent on many
simultaneous genetic alterations. This shortcoming reﬂects the combinatorics and multiple-testing problem
associated with many-body biologic interactions. We developed a novel approach, Multivariate Organization of
Combinatorial Alterations (MOCA), to partially address these challenges. Extending on previous work that accounts
for pairwise interactions, the approach rapidly combines many genomic alterations into biomarkers of drug
response, using Boolean set operations coupled with optimization; in this framework, the union, intersection, and
difference Boolean set operations are proxies of molecular redundancy, synergy, and resistance, respectively. The
algorithm is fast, broadly applicable to cancer genomics data, is of immediate use for prioritizing cancer
pharmacogenomics experiments, and recovers known clinical ﬁndings without bias. Furthermore, the results
presented here connect many important, previously isolated observations. Cancer Res; 73(6); 1699–708. Ó2012 AACR.

Major Findings
When applied to 416 pharmacogenomically characterized
cancer cell lines, Multivariate Organization of Combinatorial
Alterations (MOCA) identiﬁes many known and potential markers of drug response. For instance, correlation with ERBB
inhibitor response drastically increased when considering EGF
receptor (EGFR; ERBB1), ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4, and KRAS
alterations in a single feature. Similarly, a feature combining
IGF1, IGF1R, and RAD51 drastically increased correlation with
IGF1R inhibitor response, relative to any of these three genetic
markers considered in isolation. This approach is also powerful
for determining subsets of site-speciﬁc mutations, for a particular gene, which increase correlation with drug response. For
example, MOCA captures the differential EGFR inhibitor
response conferred by common EGFR mutations. Similarly, we
ﬁnd speciﬁc HDAC1 mutations cooperate with HDAC5 overexpression to potentiate cells to the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat. In addition, considering all pairwise gene–drug interactions, MOCA recovers known and compelling correlations,
including RTK inhibitor resistance via c-MET, EGFR, ERBB2,
and PDGFRB kinase switching; mutual exclusivity of TP53
mutation and response to the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3; greater
nutilin-3 potentiation via MDM4, rather than MDM2, overexpression; mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) and RAF inhibitor response in BRAF-mutated cell lines; and MEK inhibitor potentiating NRAS mutations.

Introduction
Cancer pharmacogenomics studies are important for discovering the molecular determinants of drug response, and
thus personalizing cancer treatment (1). Seminal work on the
NCI-60 cancer cell lines (2, 3) and many subsequent efforts (4–
7) highlighted speciﬁc genetic alterations as drug targets or
biomarkers of drug response. Recently, the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) cataloged genomics and drug response
data for nearly 1,000 cancer cells lines (8), which may provide
unprecedented power for discovering novel biomarkers. While
the clinical use of these efforts is progressing, the majority of
observed drug response is poorly explained by current pharmacogenomics models (9).
One shortcoming of contemporary cancer pharmacogenomics models may be a reliance on single-gene biomarkers
(9). There is growing evidence that response to cancer therapeutics can be modulated by the concerted impact of multiple-genetic alterations. For example, resistance to targeted
therapies can develop from alteration in off-target genes (10).
Conversely, additional potentiating alterations can be markers
of sensitivity, or even guide drug repositioning efforts (11).
Taken together, these observations suggest that accounting for
many simultaneous alterations could optimize drugging
protocols.
Computational methods are necessary for interpreting large
pharmacogenomics datasets and typically rely on simplifying
assumptions to make calculations tractable. Restricting

Quick Guide
Figure 1 illustrates the use of Boolean set operations for discovering many gene features of drug response. In Fig. 1A, neither f1 nor f2 is
signiﬁcantly correlated with drug sensitivity; however, the union of features f1 and f2 shows signiﬁcant correlation with drug sensitivity.
Here, the union operation suggests redundancy of biologic function. For instance, KRAS and BRAF mutation can drive cancer, but mutations
in both genes are rarely selected in a single patient, because their downstream output is redundant. Therefore, the union of patients with
either BRAF or KRAS activation may share a similar phenotype [such as response to mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (MEK) inhibitors (16)]. The union interaction may also be relevant for drug repositioning. For example, erlotinib was developed to
inhibit EGF receptor (EGFR), but subsequent studies found that erlotinib was also effective in some ERBB2-activated cancers (17), suggesting
that relevant targets of erlotinib inhibition are EGFR or ERBB2 activation.
The union operation is also useful for determining the subset of speciﬁc mutations, for a particular gene, that optimally describes drug
response. For instance, a single gene can have multiple, unique mutations across samples, which can differentially contribute to drug
response. In that case, the predictive value of the feature will be optimal if it includes all mutations that correlate with response but excludes
all mutations that do not.
Figure 1B illustrates the use of the intersection operation. Here, neither f3 nor f4 are correlated with drug sensitivity. But, the intersection
of genomic alterations in f3 and f4 are signiﬁcantly correlated with drug sensitivity. The intersection operation may be indicative of biologic
synergy. For example, simultaneous activation of MYC and BLC2 proto-oncogenes can have a transforming potential distinct from activation
of either gene in isolation (18).
We also consider the difference operation (Fig. 1C). The difference operation can be a proxy for drug resistance. For instance, EGFR
mutation sensitizes some tumors to erlotinib, provided KRAS is not mutated (19). See Materials and Methods and the Supplementary Data
for a detailed description of all procedures and implementation.

Materials and Methods
We considered all data types available in the CCLE (8), which
included gene expression, copy-number alteration (CNA),

mutation, and drug response. There were 416 cell lines common to all 4 data types, which were considered in this analysis.
In addition to genomic features, tissue was considered a
feature. P values were calculated using Fisher exact test
(two-tailed); features with a Benjamini and Hochberg false
discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
We also calculated the statistical sensitivity, speciﬁcity, or a
sum of both for all signiﬁcant interactions.
MOCA created drug-response–optimized mutation features
by taking the union of random collections of site-speciﬁc
mutations, for a particular gene, and comparing each random

analysis to drug–gene pairwise interactions, clusters of correlated interactions, or the average property of a collection of
genes are all successful approaches for determining drugresponse biomarkers (3, 8, 12–14). However, these approaches
cannot account for response that is strictly dependent on many
simultaneous alterations when the constituent pairwise interactions are not statistically signiﬁcant. Unfortunately, assessing the impact of many simultaneous alterations can be
computationally intractable. For instance, enumerating all
unique combinations of up to 10 genomic features, for a small
genomics dataset containing only 1,000 total features, requires
1023 comparisons. Furthermore, multiple-testing correction
for these many comparisons could be unreasonably conservative or unreasonably slow.
Here, we develop a novel conceptual framework for combining many genomic alterations into biomarkers of drug
response and incorporate the relevant functionality into our
Multivariate Organization of Combinatorial Alterations
(MOCA) algorithm (15). Genomic alterations are combined
using the union, intersection, and difference Boolean set operations and optimized to correlate with drug response. We apply
the algorithm to a dataset of more than 105 unique genomic
features and 24 anticancer drugs across 416 samples from the
CCLE. The algorithm captures compelling, novel interactions
and known correlates of drug response not highlighted in recent
studies using CCLE data with either simple Bayesian modeling,
multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA), or regularized multivariate
regression approaches (8, 12). In addition, standard pairwise
MOCA recovered many known single-gene markers of drug
response; however, multigene features have substantially higher
correlation with drug response than do single-gene features.

collection with a particular drug. MOCA uses an optimization
protocol to enrich the pool of site-speciﬁc mutation features
for those most correlated to the response of that particular
drug. A drug-response–optimized mutation feature was only
considered for subsequent analysis if it had an FDR less than
0.05 and optimization of permuted data always had an FDR
more than 0.05 (to ﬁlter genes that could be optimized below
the signiﬁcance threshold by chance).
Creation of many-gene markers of drug sensitivity began by
selecting an appropriate target feature of response. Next, the
target feature was combined with every other feature (individually), using each of 3 Boolean set operations (union,
intersection, and difference). If, for instance, the union of
feature x and the target feature had substantially greater
correlation with drug response than the target feature alone,
then feature x was considered for subsequent optimization;
this criteria was applied to all union, intersection, and difference feature–target feature combinations. Finally, union, intersection, and difference features were combined into manygene features using an optimization protocol similar to the one
used to create drug-response–optimization mutation features.
The optimization procedure was important for focusing the
search on features most correlated with drug response. Using
an entirely random approach, or exhaustive approach, can
result in prohibitively conservative multiple-testing correction
because the number of tests exceeds the signiﬁcance of any
individual interaction.
To validate the use of many-gene markers for blind prediction of drug response, we randomly divided CCLE data into
training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. We ﬁrst used the
training data to identify putative single- and many-gene
markers of drug response (i.e., drug–gene interactions with
FDR-corrected Fisher exact P values less than 0.05). Next, we
assessed the predictive value (statistical sensitivity and speciﬁcity) of those single- and many-gene markers on the holdout
testing data. See Supplementary Data for a detailed description
of all procedures and the accompanying Supplementary Data
for signiﬁcant interactions and corresponding statistics.

sensitivity; NQO1 is involved in the biosynthesis of the natural
HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAGH2 (21). HDAC1 and HDAC2 overexpression were exclusively associated with sensitivity to the
HDAC inhibitor panobinostat; in addition, HDAC5 and HDAC6
overexpression were signiﬁcantly associated with panobinostat sensitivity (22). MDM2 and MDM4 overexpression were
highly correlated with sensitivity to nutlin-3 (23).
RTK inhibitors are among the most common targeted
cancer therapeutics but are often ineffective owing to resistance (24). One proposed mechanism of resistance is so-called
kinase switching (24). In this paradigm, the targeted RTK is
rendered nonessential via the upregulation of an off-target
RTK. We ﬁnd an intriguing network of potential kinaseswitching interactions among the signiﬁcant expression–drug
correlations. Figure 2 shows the relationship of EGFR, ERBB2,
c-MET, and PDGFRB expression, to the 6 RTK inhibitors in
the CCLE. As an example, EGFR underexpression is cooccurring with sensitivity to 5 RTK inhibitors and has mutually
exclusive overexpression with sensitivity to the ALK inhibitor
TAE684.
CNA-based biomarkers included interesting correlates of
drug response. KLF5 ampliﬁcation was exclusively associated
sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901; KLF5 activates
the MEK/ERK pathway via EGFR stimulation (25). MITF
ampliﬁcation was exclusively associated with sensitivity to
PLX4720; MITF ampliﬁcation and BRAF mutations are cooccurring in human cancers and cancer cell lines (2). JAK3
ampliﬁcation was mutually exclusive with 17-AAG sensitivity,
suggesting JAK3 ampliﬁcation is a contributor to 17-AAG
resistance. Seven SERPINB genes (2–4, 7, 10, 12, 13) had
copy-number deletion mutually exclusive with RAF265 sensitivity, suggesting this family of genes is important for potentiating CCLE cell lines to this RAF drug; this family of protease
inhibitors clusters on chromosome 18 and is associated with
the malignant phenotype (26).

Results and Discussion
We sought to determine genetic alterations and combinations of genetic alterations that are markers of drug response in
the CCLE. Correlations between drug response and genetic
alterations were considered signiﬁcant if the corresponding
FDR was less than 0.05. Herein, we highlight alterations that are
either known biomarkers in human cancer, or those that
present a compelling case based on human biology.

In some cases, tissue type was signiﬁcantly correlated with
drug sensitivity. Hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue was the
broadest marker of drug sensitivity, among tissue features,
predicting sensitivity to 15 of 24 drugs. Similarly, PD-0325901
had the most cross-tissue potency and was correlated with
large intestine, pancreas, and skin tissues. Conversely, ovarian
tissue was signiﬁcantly resistant to the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 and lung tissue was resistant to panobinostat.
We used three types of mutation features: (i) gene-speciﬁc
mutation features, which include all gene-speciﬁc mutations
in a single feature. (ii) Mutation-speciﬁc mutation features,
which represent each speciﬁc mutation as a unique feature
(e.g., TP53 H193R is its own feature). (iii) Using an optimization
protocol, a subset of mutation-speciﬁc mutation features
that optimized correlation with drug response, for a speciﬁc
drug–gene combination, were combined into a single feature;
these features are referred to as drug-response–optimized
mutation features throughout.
BRAFV600E potentiated cells to the RAF inhibitors PLX4720
and RAF265 and the MEK inhibitors AZD6244 and PD-0329501;
these four known interactions (27) were the only signiﬁcant
mutation-speciﬁc mutation features identiﬁed. Six signiﬁcant
gene-speciﬁc mutation features of drug response were identiﬁed, which included the four BRAF interactions as well as
AZD624-sensitizing NRAS mutations (27) and mutual exclusivity of nutlin-3 sensitivity and TP53 mutations; nutlin-3
inhibits the TP53 inhibitor MDM2 and is known to selectively
target cancers with wild-type TP53 (28).
Drug-response–optimized mutation features
Many drug-response–optimized mutation features are
known or compelling correlates of drug response that were
not identiﬁed in previous studies using CCLE data (8, 12).
EGFR-optimized mutation features were exclusively associated with sensitivity to all three CCLE EGFR inhibitors. Figure 3A
shows consensus EGFR mutations for each of the three EGFR
inhibitors; consensus mutations are those seen with the highest frequency during optimization (see Creation of drugresponse–optimized mutation features in the Supplementary
Data). Of the 52 CCLE EGFR mutations, MOCA converges on
a few mutations as being primarily responsible for sensitivity
to all 3 CCLE EGFR inhibitors, including two deletions in
exon 19 (ELREA746del and ELR746del), Y1069C, and S768I.
Notably, deletions at position 746 and 747 create the highest
known sensitivity to erlotinib and geﬁtinib (29). Similarly,
The EGFR S768I mutation sensitizes tumors to geﬁtinib (30).
The EGFR Y1069C consensus mutation is interesting because
it correlated with sensitivity to all three EGFR inhibitors, a
site of phosphorylation, but not yet considered an oncogenic
mutation or biomarker of drug sensitivity. Interestingly, L858R
and exon 19 deletions are the most prevalent oncogenic
EGFR mutations, but EGFR inhibitor response rates are twice
as high in tumors with exon 19 deletions (29); remarkably,
MOCA recovers this differential sensitivity (see Fig. 3A).
ERBB4-optimized mutation features correlated with
response to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and lapatinib, and
the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG. Of the 89 ERBB4 mutations in the
CCLE, the consensus mutations were mostly kinase domain

1702

mutations (Fig. 3B). Of ERBB family members, ERBB4 shares
the greatest sequence homology with EGFR (ERBB1) and is
known to interact with some EGFR inhibitors. For instance,
lapatinib inhibits EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4 (31). Figure 3
shows superimposed crystals structures of lapatinib-bound
EFGR and lapatinib-bound ERBB4, highlighting the similar
modes of lapatinib interaction for both proteins. Comparing
the similar binding orientation adopted by the EGFR–erlotinib
complex (Fig. 3D), it seems plausible that erlotinib may also
interact with ERBB4. Indeed, recent experiments suggest that
erlotinib, similar to lapatinib, is a multispeciﬁcity ERBB inhibitor that interacts with EGFR and ERBB4 (32).
Similar results were obtained for many drug-response–
optimized mutation features. NFKB2 was one of the 18 optimized mutation features associated with sensitivity to the
XIAP inhibitor LBW242; XIAP is an antiapoptotic gene regulated by NFKB2 (33). EXT2-optimized mutation features
were signiﬁcantly correlated with lapatinib, erlotinib, and
AZD0530 sensitivity; EXT2 is involved in heparin sulfate biosynthesis and high serum heparin sulfate concentration is
associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors (34). Of the 37
KRAS and 24 NRAS mutations in the CCLE, consensus mutations of MEK inhibitor sensitivity are known RAS activation
sites (16). Extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 4
(MAPK4) was exclusively associated with sensitivity to the
MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244. PTEN-optimized mutation features were exclusively associated with sensitivity to the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan (35). Remarkably, HDAC1 optimization was exclusively associated with sensitivity to the
HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (22). Of the 18 drug-response–
optimized mutation features correlated with the receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD-6474, seven were kinases (PRKDC,
EGFR, PRKAR1B, CLK3, PIK3C2B, PLK3, and EPHA5). MOCA
ﬁnds that activating KRAS mutations confer resistance
to TKI258. This is intriguing because KRAS is downstream of
FGFR in the MEK/ERK pathway, and KRAS mutation was
recently associated with FGFR inhibitor resistance (36).
MOCA-derived drug-response–optimized mutation features
address several limitations. For example, approaches that
restrict analysis to mutation- or gene-speciﬁc mutation features would not recover these important correlations, including
the differential potentiation among EGFR mutations. Furthermore, database-driven approaches, such as restricting analysis
to mutations present in COSMIC (37), could miss novel but
potentially important ﬁndings, such as sensitizing EGFR mutations at the Y1069 phosphorylation site. And, the ERBB4optimized mutation feature highlights the ability of unbiased
approaches to identify relevant targets for drug repositioning.
All signiﬁcant pairwise drug–gene correlations, including drugresponse–optimized mutation features, are in the accompanying Supplementary Data along with corresponding P values,
FDRs, and statistical sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Collections of simultaneously altered genes as
biomarkers of drug response
As the earlier results collectively highlight, single-gene markers can recover many known correlations of drug response.
However, these interactions fail to properly identify a

signiﬁcant portion of both responders and nonresponders. For
instance, we found that EGFR overexpression (EGFRExpþ) was
signiﬁcantly correlated erlotinib sensitivity (erlotinibþ) in the
CCLE (see Table 1). But, EGFRExpþ identiﬁes erlotinibþ with a
speciﬁcity of 76.8% and a statistical sensitivity of 63.4%, meaning the EGFRExpþ marker calls many false negatives and misses
many true positives, respectively. A similar result was obtained
for the vast number of single-feature markers.
We sought to determine many-gene features that had
increased correlation with drug response, relative to the corresponding target feature alone. Here, we deﬁne a target as the
gene, or member of the pathway, which the drug was designed
to inhibit (see Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary
Data for a list of targets used for each drug). Target features
were combined with every other feature, individually, using the
union, intersection, and difference set operations and com-

pared with the relevant drug response vector. Importantly, this
approach does not increase the number of interactions (combinatorial space) relative to the number of pairwise interactions. We required these three-body interactions (i.e., drug,
target, and another feature) to have a P value at least two
orders of magnitude lower than the constituent pairwise drug–
target interaction. This conservative procedure returned a
reasonably parsimonious list of features, with many convincing and known correlates of drug response not captured
by pairwise MOCA calculations or previous statistical and
machine learning approaches applied to the same data (8, 12).
Table 1 highlights the increase in statistical sensitivity and
speciﬁcity that can be obtained with many-feature biomarkers
of drug response. For instance, the union of EGFRExpþ and
ERBB4OptMut has a 6.7% increase in statistical sensitivity, relative to EGFRExpþ alone, for identifying erlotinib response.

Importantly, the ERBB4OptMut feature was the result of optimizing the union of ERBB4 mutation-speciﬁc mutation features,
which was required to capture this known interaction. The
union of EGFRExpþ, ERBB4OptMut, and ERBB2Expþ increases
the statistical sensitivity for identifying erlotinibþ by more
than 20% relative to EGFRExpþ alone. This suggests some patients altered in ERBB2, but not necessarily EGFR, may also
beneﬁt from erlotinib. Indeed, patients with ERBB2 alteration
and not EGFR alteration can beneﬁt from erlotinib treatment
(17); notably, the interaction of ERBB2Expþ and erlotinibþ alone
is weakly correlated in the CCLE data and was only identiﬁed
when considering many-gene features. Table 1 also shows erlotinib resistance arising from ERBB3 underexpression and/or
KRAS mutation; remarkably, ERBB3-deﬁcient cancer cell lines
can exhibit erlotinib resistance (38) and KRAS mutation is a
strong predictor of erlotinib resistance (19). Importantly,
KRAS mutation is weakly correlated with erlotinib resistance
in the CCLE, and this known mechanism of resistance would
not be recovered without considering many-body interactions.
This 5-gene biomarker (ﬁfth row, Table 1) results in approximately 20% increase in statistical sensitivity and approximately 5% increase in speciﬁcity. Therefore, this biomarker might be
used to identify a substantially greater number of patients that
could beneﬁt from erlotinib treatment, rather than considering
the target (EGFR alteration) alone. And, that fewer nonresponders would be subjected to a treatment that may be ineffective.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the individual and combined
markers mentioned earlier.
There is some controversy about the role of MDM4 in
sensitizing cancers to the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3. Some
speculation arises from the structural homology of MDM2
and MDM4 proteins and the similar p53-binding interfaces
(Fig. 4A). A crystal structure of MDM2 binding a nutlin-3 analog
(nutlin-2) revealed a compelling mode of action for nutlin-3, in
which p53 is displaced from the native p53-MDM2 interface; a
similar mode of action has been proposed for nutlin-3 binding
MDM4 (see Fig. 4A). Laurie and colleagues used molecular
modeling, binding assays, and retinoblastoma killing in rodent
models to infer the interaction of MDM4 and nutlin-3 (23).
Conversely, using nuclear magnetic resonance competition
experiments and structural comparison, Popowicz and colleagues concluded that MDM4 and nutlin-3 do not interact (39).
And Hu and colleagues found that MDM4 expression can cause
nutlin-3 resistance in tumor cells (40). In the CCLE, MOCA
ﬁnds increased correlation of MDM4Expþ with nutlin-3þ, compared with MDM2Expþ (Table 2). However, taking either the
union or intersection of MDM2Expþ and MDM4Expþ seems to
better resolve the origin of potentiation in these cell lines.
Taken together, the results in Table 2 suggest that either
MDM2Expþ or MDM4Expþ is sufﬁcient to sensitize some cell
lines to nutlin-3, but that simultaneous upregulation of both
markers synergize to further sensitize some CCLE cell lines. We
highlight this as an open question and contend that the CCLE
contributes to the emerging role of MDM4 expression, with
respect to nutlin-3 sensitivity. Figure 4C shows the distribution
of the individual and combined MDM2 and MDM4 markers.
There were many other striking multigenes features, all of
which signiﬁcantly improved correlation with drug response,

relative to that drugs target alone. For instance, the union of
the BRAFV600E feature and the NRAS-optimized mutation
feature (NRASOptMut) improved the statistical sensitivity for
identifying response to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 by more
than 25% relative to NRASOptMut alone. This suggests that the
relevant biomarker for response to this MEK inhibitor includes
either BRAF or NRAS mutation; indeed, mutation in either gene
is known to potentiate cancers to AZD6244 (41). Similar to the
erlotinib example (Table 1), correlation with lapatinib
response was greatly increased by a feature that includes
EGFROptMut, ERBB2Expþ, and ERBB4OptMut; lapatinib is an
inhibitor of these 3 ERBB family members (31). The union of
HDAC5Expþ and HDAC1OptMut increases the statistical sensitivity for identifying response to the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat by approximately 33% relative to HDAC1OptMut alone;
panobinostat is a strong inhibitor of both HDAC1 and HDAC5
(22).
During pairwise calculation, MOCA found signiﬁcant correlation between IGF1R inhibitor (AEW541) sensitivity and
IGF1Expþ but not IGF1RExpþ. However, MOCA ﬁnds that the
union of IGF1Expþ and IGF1RExpþ has signiﬁcantly increased
signiﬁcance with AEW541þ, relative to either alone. This
result is important for two reasons: (i) it suggests that either
IGF1Expþ or IGF1RExpþ is sufﬁcient to potentiate some

cancers for AEW541. (ii) It shows that combined features
can identify important interactions that are missed comparing only pairwise interactions. In addition, the intersection of RAD51Expþ and IGF1Expþ enhances the speciﬁcity of
AEW541þ identiﬁcation; RAD51-mediated DNA repair is
stimulated by IGF1, and cells deﬁcient for IGF1R function
show signiﬁcantly less RAD51-mediated DNA repair (42). All
signiﬁcant three-body interactions derived from combining
features with set operations are in the accompanying Supplementary Data, along with corresponding P values, FDRs,
and statistical sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Next, we combined genomic features, determined signiﬁcant in the previous step, into many-gene biomarkers that
optimize correlation with drug response. An important parameter of our new method provides the ability to create manygene features that optimize a desired predictive value. This
type of approach may be useful in a setting in which a clinical
decision must consider the aggressiveness of the cancer and
the toxicity of the relevant drugging protocols. For example,
the side effects associated with some chemotherapeutics
may warrant a highly speciﬁc marker, so that inherent risk is
almost certainly coupled with beneﬁt. On the other hand,
more aggressive cancers may necessitate a highly sensitive
test, so that drugs most broadly applicable can be prioritized.

And, in many scenarios, a balance between statistical sensitivity and speciﬁcity may be desirable to balance the posttest
risk with the general efﬁcacy of the therapeutic regimen under
consideration.
The last three rows of Table 1 show features optimized to
correlate with erlotinib response, maximizing either the statistical sensitivity, speciﬁcity, or sum of both. The many-gene
feature in the sixth row of Table 1 was optimized for maximal
speciﬁcity (95.5%) while maintaining reasonable statistical
sensitivity (70.7%); therefore, this marker identiﬁes the majority of potential responders in the CCLE, and almost never
falsely calls nonresponders. Similarly, the marker in row seven
of Table 1 identiﬁes erlotinib response with a statistical
sensitivity of 95.1% and a speciﬁcity of 74.1%. And, the ﬁnal
marker in Table 1 achieves a nearly 90% statistical sensitivity
and speciﬁcity for erlotinib response.
Similar to our method of deriving drug-response–optimized
mutation features, when creating many-gene markers of drug
response, MOCA reports features observed most frequently in
top-predicting combined features (i.e., consensus features).
This protocol is useful for highlighting features that most
consistently combine to optimize correlation with drug
response. For instance, features including the intersection of
one or more of 9 KRT family genes (KRT5, 6A–6C, and 13–17)
were consistently top markers of erlotinib response; KRT genes
are known to coexpress with EGFR, and other ERBB-family
genes, in many human cancers (43). CBLC, KLF2, and KLF5 are
all regulators of EGFR, and MOCA found the expression of
these genes to be highly correlated consensus features of
erlotinib response during optimization; CBLC is also a consensus feature for lapatinib response. ERBB family members
were among the most enriched consensus features for both
erlotinib and lapatinib. Interestingly, a TP53 drug-optimized
mutation feature was the most enriched consensus feature for
identifying lapatinib sensitivity in union with ERBB2 overexpression. KRAS mutation was the third most enriched
consensus feature of erlotinib resistance. MDM4 overexpression was the seventh-ranked consensus feature for synergizing
with MDM2 overexpression to sensitize cells to nutlin-3.
PDGFRB, EGFR, and c-MET overexpression or ampliﬁcation
were all top-ranked consensus features of panobinostat resistance. This may be an important ﬁnding because many
cancers are upregulated in one or more of these 3 oncogenes.
Hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue was among the most
enriched consensus features of panobinostat sensitivity; this
is the only case in which a tissue type was a consensus feature
during derivation of many-feature markers of drug response. It
is noteworthy that many-gene features are more correlated
with drug response than tissue type, because molecular markers facilitate a more speciﬁc diagnosis than is possible with
tissue type alone.
Finally, we assessed the potential use of many-gene biomarkers for blind prediction. For this validation calculation, CCLE
data was divided into 333 samples (80%) for training and 83
samples (20%) for testing. First, training data was used to
identify putative single- and many-gene predictors of drug
response. Next, the predictive value (statistical sensitivity and
speciﬁcity) of these single- and many-gene predictors was

1706

Cancer Res; 73(6) March 15, 2013

calculated on the holdout testing data. To make the algorithm
more amenable to automation, these proof-of-concept calculations were restricted to expression data, and we considered
three drugs (erlotinib, lapatinib, and nutlin-3).
The top 25 most predictive, expression-based, single-gene
markers of erlotinib response had a mean statistical sensitivity
of 0.77 and a SD of 0.07. Speciﬁcity for this same set of 25 singlegene markers was 0.83  0.06. The top 25 most predictive,
expression-based, many-gene markers of erlotinib response
had a statistical sensitivity 1.0  0.0 and a speciﬁcity of 0.85 
0.02. Furthermore, each of the top 25 many-gene markers had a
better predictive value (calculated as the sum of statistical
sensitivity and speciﬁcity) than any of the top 25 single-gene
markers.
Similar results were obtained for lapatinib and nutlin-3. For
instance, the top 25 single-gene markers of lapatinib response
had a statistical sensitivity of 0.67  0.08 and a speciﬁcity of
0.83  0.06. Top many-gene predictors of lapatinib response
had a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 0.82  0.05 and 0.81  0.05,
respectively. Single-gene markers of nutlin-3 response had
poor predictive values, with a sensitivity of 0.35  0.09 and
a sensitivity of 0.80  0.03. Conversely, many-gene predictors of
nutlin-3 response had high predictive value, with a sensitivity
0.80  0.0 and speciﬁcity of 0.93  0.01, respectively. And, for
both lapatinib and nutlin-3, each of the top 25 many-gene
markers had a better predictive value than any of the top 25
single-gene markers.
Proof-of-concept validation calculations yielded many-gene
predictors of drug response with high predictive value, similar
to those obtained not using a holdout test dataset. Also,
predictive value was consistently higher for many-gene predictors, compared with single-gene predictors. Taken together,
these results suggest that MOCA, and many-gene predictors,
may be useful for improving blind prediction drug response in
cancer cell lines.

Conclusion
The ability to identify many known and compelling correlates of drug response, including single and many-gene biomarkers, highlights the use of MOCA, the CCLE, and the
inhibitors considered. MOCA introduces a novel approach to
combining many genomic features into biomarkers of phenotype. The abstraction of considering Boolean set operations as
proxies of molecular redundancy, synergy, and resistance
seems to have some validity. Furthermore, MOCA's optimization protocols focus the search enough to reduce combinatorics and quickly converge upon meaningful, many-feature
markers of response.
It is important to note that the majority of ﬁndings highlighted here are known markers or targets of drug response in
human cancers. This result implies that cancer cell lines can be
useful model systems of human cancers. In addition, the 24
drugs currently proﬁled in the CCLE seem to be potent
inhibitors of their intended targets. And, as shown here,
unbiased computational analysis of such pharmacogenomics
datasets may be useful for identifying relevant targets for
drug repositioning.

Multigene Biomarkers of Cancer Cell Drug Response

Here, we derived many-gene markers of drug response using
a stochastic optimization process. As such, the algorithm is
subject to getting trapped in local minima. Furthermore, the
astronomic combinatorial space associated the many-body
search conducted here virtually guarantees the existence of
many-gene biomarkers with similar, or better predictive value
than those recovered in our study. Indeed, it is computationally
intractable to guarantee the recovery of the most optimal
solution owing to computational burden and multiple-testing
problem imparted by the large combinatorial space. The
contribution of this work is the ability to identify many-feature
predictors of drug response that are an improvement relative
to single-feature predictors; but, these represent "good" solutions, not necessarily the "best" solution.
