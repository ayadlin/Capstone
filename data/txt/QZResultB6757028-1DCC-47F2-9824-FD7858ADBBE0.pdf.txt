Abstract
iRGD is a derivative of the integrin-binding peptide RGD,
which selectively increases the penetrability of tumor tissue to
various coadministered substances in several preclinical models. In this study, we investigated the ability of iRGD to improve
the delivery of sorafenib and doxorubicin therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using established mouse models of
the disease. A contrast-enhanced MRI method was developed in
parallel to assess the in vivo effects of iRGD in this setting. We
found that iRGD improved the delivery of marker substances to
the tumors of HCC-bearing mice about three-fold without a
parallel increase in normal tissues. Control peptides lacking the

critical CendR motif had no effect. Similarly, iRGD also selectively increased the signal intensity from tumors in Gd-DTPA–
enhanced MRI. In terms of antitumor efﬁcacy, iRGD coadministration signiﬁcantly augmented the individual inhibitory
effects of sorafenib and doxorubicin without increasing systemic toxicity. Overall, our results offered a preclinical proof of
concept for the use of iRGD coadministration as a strategy to
widen the therapeutic window for HCC chemotherapy, as
monitored by Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI as a noninvasive, clinically applicable method to identify iRGD-reactive tumors.

Introduction

A selective increase of the delivery of systemically administered
anticancer drugs into the HCCs would be an important step
toward improving the efﬁcacy of the therapy in this tumor entity.
Recently, pioneering work from Ruoslahti and colleagues has
shown that particular peptides containing a vascular recognition
motif, an R/KXXR/K tissue penetration (CendR) motif, and a
protease recognition site, increase the delivery of diverse kinds
of attached reagents such as nanoparticles, viruses, or antibodies
in several mouse tumor models, taking payloads deep into tumor
tissue, whereas normal tissues remain unaffected (4, 5). These
peptides, prototypically represented by the cyclic RGD peptide
CRGDK/RGPD/EC, termed iRGD, home to the tumors by initially
binding to av integrins that are speciﬁcally expressed on the
endothelium of tumor vessels and other cells within the tumors,
but not in normal tissues, and are then cleaved by an unknown
protease (4–7). This results in the generation of CRGDK/R, which
dissociates from the integrins and binds to neuropilin-1 (NRP1),
thereby activating an endocytic bulk transport pathway through
the tumor tissue (8–11). The increased tumor delivery of iRGDconjugated payloads has been shown in different experimental
tumor models by other independent studies (12, 13) and translates into a higher therapeutic efﬁcacy (4, 5).
iRGD can also increase the concentrations of diverse systemically administered substances speciﬁcally in tumors, when coadministered rather than being directly coupled to the cargo in some
tumor models (5, 14, 15). This bystander effect of iRGD would be
much more convenient and versatile, as it would allow combined
application with the currently used antitumor drugs but is less
well-investigated than its transport-enhancing effect upon coupling to the cargo and thus needs validation and examination in

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third ranking cause of
cancer-related mortality and is highly resistant to anticancer drugs
(1, 2). In the majority of cases, HCC is diagnosed in advanced
stages. Therefore, only a minority of patients has potentially
curative treatment options, including radiofrequency ablation,
resection, and liver transplantation. Patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic disease have a median survival of only a few
months, which can be extended by the multikinase inhibitor
sorafenib by 2 to 3 months, but at the expense of substantial
side effects (3). Thus, there is a strong clinical need to improve the
drug therapy of patients with HCC.

other tumor entities. Moreover, the effect of iRGD on tumor
penetrability is likely to vary among different tumors, for instance,
due to differential expression of avb3/5 integrins and NRP1 (14).
Thus, for an efﬁcient use of iRGD, a clinically applicable method
to determine whether a particular tumor reacts to iRGD would be
highly beneﬁcial.
iRGD has not been explored in HCC. In particular, the bystander effect of iRGD would be of high clinical importance in this
tumor entity, as it could be used to increase the therapeutic index
of sorafenib in HCC, and it may confer therapeutic efﬁcacy to
antitumor substances that are not beneﬁcial to the patients per se.
Here, we show that iRGD shows the bystander effect in HCC
mouse models, that the increased tumor-penetrability by iRGD
can be detected by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI with and without
iRGD, and that iRGD augments the therapeutic effects of coadministered sorafenib and doxorubicin.

Materials and Methods
Peptides
Synthetic iRGD (CRGDKGPDC) and RGD control peptide
(CRGDDGPKC), synthesized circular via a cystein–cystein disulﬁde bond between amino acid 1 and 9 (5), were purchased from
GenScript USA Inc. The purity was more than 98%.
Generation of transgenic mice and visualization of HCC
All animal experiments were approved by the local animal care
committee and were in agreement with German legal requirements. The animals were inspected every 2 to 3 days. Male TGFa/
c-myc bitransgenic mice were generated by crossing homozygous
metallothionein/TGFa and albumin/c-myc single transgenic
mice in CD13B6CBA background as described (16, 17). After
weaning, the mice received ZnCl2 (via the drinking water) to
induce the expression of TGFa and thereby accelerate hepatocarcinogenesis. To detect and monitor the endogenously formed
HCCs in the TGFa/c-myc mice, gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)enhanced MRI was performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Siemens
Magnetom Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions) as described recently
(17–19). A representative image of HCC imaging by Gd-EOBDTPA–enhanced MRI is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Mice
with HCC as visualized by Gd-EOB-DTPA–enhanced MRI were
used in the subsequent experiments.
Nude mice experiments
HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and RIKEN
BioResource Center, respectively, and were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Life
Technologies; ref. 17). The cells were authenticated by SNP
genotyping within the past 6 months and were routinely monitored for morphologic and growth characteristics and mycoplasms. A total of 5  106 cells (resuspended in 100 mL of PBS)
was injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of NMRI Foxn1 nude
mice (Harlan Laboratories B.V.). Three to 4 weeks later, the mice
were assigned to the treatment groups. For the tumor penetration
experiments, the mice were used 5 to 7 weeks after the inoculation
of the tumor cells.
Tumor penetration experiments
TGFa/c-myc mice with liver tumors according to Gd-EOBDTPA–enhanced MRI or nude mice bearing HepG2 and Huh-7
xenografts received iRGD, RGD control peptide (4 mmol/kg each),

3148 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

or PBS by tail vein injection. Fifteen minutes later, Evans Blue
(33.3 mg/kg, MP Biomedicals) or doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, SigmaAldrich) was injected intravenously. Another 30 (Evans Blue) or
60 minutes (doxorubicin) later, the mice were terminally perfused
with Ringer solution by cannulation of the left heart ventricle.
After laparotomy, the organs were inspected macroscopically, and
the liver, tumor, and other organs were excised. For Evans Blue
quantiﬁcation, the dye was extracted from tissues in N,Ndimethylformamide for 24 hours at 37 C and quantiﬁed by
measuring the absorbance at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer
(Beckman Coulter, DU 800).
To determine the concentration of doxorubicin in the organs,
the tissues were homogenized in 1% SDS and 1 mmol/L H2SO4 in
water. Thereafter, doxorubicin was extracted by adding 2 mL of
chloroform/isopropanol (1:1, v/v) to the homogenized samples,
followed by vortexing and freeze/thaw cycles. The samples were
centrifuged at 14,000  g for 15 minutes, and the absorbance of
the organic phase (lowest phase) at 490 nm was measured
photometrically.
Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI with and without iRGD
To study the effect of iRGD on Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI of
HCC, TGFa/c-myc mice, in which HCC had been detected by
Gd-EOB-DTPA–enhanced MRI one week before or nude mice with
HepG2 or Huh-7 were used. The mice were anesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (70mg/kg body weight) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight), followed by a basal T1–weighted
MRI and immediately thereafter a Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI (17).
Twelve to 24 hours later, either iRGD or RGD control peptide
(100 mL each via tail vein) was injected, followed by a basal and a
Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI (18). For quantitative analyses of the
MRI data, signal intensities were measured with operator-deﬁned
regions of interest (ROI) drawn into the images as described
recently (19). ROIs were placed in livers and tumors. Signal
intensity changes were calculated by subtracting the precontrast
values from the signal intensities obtained upon addition of GdDTPA. The alterations of the signal intensity in the tumors and
livers due to iRGD or RGD control peptide were expressed as fold
increase of the signal intensity by Gd-DTPA preinjected with PBS.
Treatment of nude mice
Doxorubicin was dissolved in PBS and sorafenib in a vehicle
containing 12.5% Cremophor and 12.5% ethanol. Nude mice
bearing HepG2 or Huh-7 xenografts received iRGD, RGD control
peptide (4 mmol/kg by tail vein injection), or PBS 15 minutes each
time before treatment with doxorubicin (3 mg/kg, 3 times per week
intraperitoneally) or sorafenib (every second day orally). Body
weight and tumor size were determined every 2 to 3 days with a
caliper. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacriﬁced by
cervical dislocation. Tumors were excised and weighed.
Phospho-kinase array
Tumor homogenates were analyzed in a panel of phosphorylation proﬁles of kinases (Human Phospho-MAPK Array,
ARY002B; R&D Systems). The tumor lysates were matched for
protein as determined by the BCA protein assay (BioRad). Each
membrane was incubated with 200 mg of protein lysates as
described by the manufacturer. A cocktail of biotinylated detection
antibodies, streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent detection reagents were used to detect the phosphorylated

Coadministered iRGD, but not a peptide containing an RGD
motif lacking CendR motif, increases the entry of Evans Blue
and doxorubicin selectively in HCC
To investigate whether iRGD shows the bystander effect in
HCC, we examined the effect of intravenously administered iRGD
on the levels of coadministered albumin-binding dye Evans Blue
in TGFa/c-myc mice with endogenously formed HCC (16). To
this end, mice with liver tumors as detected by Gd-EOB-DTPA–
enhanced MRI were intravenously injected with iRGD, an RGD
peptide lacking the CendR motif (RGD control peptide) or saline,
followed by intravenous administration of Evans Blue 15 minutes
later. After another 30 minutes, the mice were terminally perfused.
Photometric quantiﬁcation of the dye extracted from the tissues
revealed a 3-fold increase of Evans Blue in the tumor tissue from
iRGD-injected mice as compared with the HCC tissue from PBSinjected mice (P ¼ 0.014 as compared with RGD control peptide
and P ¼ 0.0012 as compared with PBS), whereas the RGD control
peptide or vehicle had no effect (Fig. 1A). iRGD or control peptide
had no effects on the concentration of Evans Blue in the normal
tissues examined (liver, kidney, spleen, and lung), indicating that
iRGD speciﬁcally increased the permeability of the HCC tissue in
TGFa/c-myc mice for codelivered substances.
To examine whether the bystander effect of iRGD also occurs in
HCC xenograft mouse models, we studied the effect of intravenously injected iRGD on the levels of systemically administered
Evans Blue in nude mice bearing HepG2 or Huh-7 xenografts.
iRGD increased the levels of coadministered Evans Blue in HepG2
and Huh-7 xenografts by 3.4-fold (P  0.002; HepG2 cells) and
2.6-fold (P < 0.001; Huh-7 cells), respectively, as compared with
the tumors from animals treated with PBS or RGD control peptide
(Fig. 1B and C).
Next, we investigated the inﬂuence of iRGD on the tissue
concentrations of intravenously coadministered doxorubicin, a
therapeutic substance, which can be tracked by its ﬂuorescence, in
the TGFa/c-myc and HepG2 xenograft HCC mouse models. As
illustrated in Fig. 2, iRGD increased the levels of doxorubicin in
the HCCs of both HCC models (P  0.0011). In contrast, iRGD
had no effect on the doxorubicin levels in other organs (Fig. 2A).
The control peptide had no effect on the levels of doxorubicin in
any tissue examined. Thus, iRGD strongly and selectively
increased the levels of doxorubicin in the HCC tissue in 2 HCC
mouse models.

Coadministered iRGD, but not a peptide containing a RGD motif lacking the

HepG2 (B) or Huh-7 xenografts (C) were intravenously injected with
4 mmol/kg of iRGD or control peptide (dissolved in PBS), or PBS alone,

of iRGD. Therefore, we examined whether the tumor-permeabilizing effect of iRGD can be detected by Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI,
a broadly used clinical procedure, in TGFa/c-myc mice with
endogenously formed HCCs as detected by Gd-EOB-DTPA–
enhanced MRI one week before. These mice were subjected to
a Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI, which showed negatively contrasted
HCCs in the livers (Fig. 3B, left). Twelve to 24 hours later, the mice
were injected with iRGD or RGD control peptide, followed by GdDTPA–enhanced MRI (Fig. 3A). As illustrated in Fig. 3B (left), the
tumors in the mice injected with PBS or RGD control peptide were
negatively contrasted in the livers. Injection of iRGD before the
Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI elicited a substantial increase in the
signal intensity of the tumors, which now were positively rather
than negatively contrasted in the livers (Fig. 3B, right). In contrast,
iRGD and RGD control peptide did not alter the signal intensity of
liver or other normal tissues, suggesting speciﬁcity of this effect of

iRGD for the tumors. Quantitative densitometric analyses of the
signal intensities revealed a 2-fold increase in the tumors upon
injection of iRGD as compared with the injection of RGD control
peptide (P ¼ 0.004) or PBS (P < 0.001; Fig. 3C). The response of
the HCCs to iRGD showed some variance in the transgenic HCC
mouse model, ranging from substantial increase in signal intensity in approximately half of the tumors, whereas others
responded less or not at all, reﬂecting heterogeneity of the tumors
in this HCC mouse model.
We next investigated whether iRGD also increased the MRI
signal of the tumors in HCC xenograft–bearing nude mice. As
shown in Fig. 3D, iRGD effectively increased the signal intensity of the tumors in the HepG2 tumors (P ¼ 0.0311). Similar
observations were obtained in Huh-7 xenografts (P ¼ 0.0081),
but the increase of the tumor signal was less pronounced (1.5fold; Fig. 3E) as compared with the other HCC mouse models
(2-fold). These data indicate that the iRGD-induced increase
in tumor penetrability could be detected noninvasively by GdDTPA–enhanced MRI in the 3 different HCC mouse models.
iRGD increased the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin as well as
of sorafenib in HepG2 tumor–bearing nude mice
We next examined whether the iRGD-induced increase of the
HCC penetrability is accompanied by an increased efﬁcacy of
therapeutic substances in HCC. Although the response rates to
doxorubicin as single agent are low and prolonged survival of the
patients with advanced HCC could not be demonstrated (20, 21),
it is possible that elevated intratumoral doxorubicin levels upon
coinjection of iRGD may translate into an increased therapeutic
response to doxorubicin. Therefore, we studied the effect of
coadministered iRGD on tumor progression in nude mice bearing
established HepG2 xenografts. The animals were treated with
iRGD, control peptide or PBS, and doxorubicin. The progression
of HepG2 xenografts was signiﬁcantly reduced in mice treated
with doxorubicin and iRGD as compared with those treated with
doxorubicin and control peptide (Fig. 4A). At the end of the
experiment, the tumor volumes from the mice treated with iRGD
and doxorubicin had increased by approximately 50%, whereas
those in mice treated with doxorubicin plus control peptide
showed a 3-fold increase (P ¼ 0.0061; Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the
tumor masses were signiﬁcantly lower in mice treated with iRGD
plus doxorubicin as compared with those from mice treated with

3150 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

doxorubicin and control peptide (P ¼ 0.035) or PBS (P ¼
0.0027; Fig. 4B). The body weight shift was similar, irrespective
of whether doxorubicin was given alone or in combination with
iRGD (Supplementary Fig. S2). This supports the notion that the
elevated antitumor effect of the combination therapy as compared with doxorubicin alone was due to increased intratumoral
doxorubicin levels and inhibition of tumor growth rather than an
increased toxicity.
Sorafenib is the only drug currently approved that prolongs
survival of patients with advanced HCC (3). However, a major
portion of patients does not respond to sorafenib therapy and
substantial side effects are frequent (3). To investigate whether
iRGD may improve the therapeutic efﬁcacy of sorafenib in HCC,
HepG2 xenograft–bearing nude mice were treated with iRGD and
a low dose of sorafenib (20 mg/kg every second day) or vehicle.
Sorafenib alone or in combination with control peptide produced
small growth-inhibitory effects, which did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. In contrast, in mice treated with sorafenib plus iRGD,
tumor progression was signiﬁcantly reduced as compared with
mice treated with sorafenib alone (P ¼ 0.014 at the end of the
experiment) or sorafenib plus control peptide (P ¼ 0.001 at the
end of treatment; Fig. 4C). Determination of the tumor masses at
the end of the experiment revealed that the tumors from iRGDplus sorafenib-treated animals had signiﬁcantly lower masses
than the tumors from animals treated with sorafenib alone
(P < 0.001) or with control peptide plus sorafenib (P ¼ 0.011; Fig.
4D). Similar results were obtained in Huh-7 xenografted nude
mice (Fig. 4E and F). The body weight shifts were the same
irrespective of whether sorafenib was given alone or combined
with iRGD (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that iRGD
increased the therapeutic efﬁcacy of sorafenib without increasing
its toxicity.
To investigate whether coadministered iRGD indeed acts by
reinforcing the inhibitory effects of sorafenib on intracellular
kinase pathways, we studied the relative phosphorylation levels
of major families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
and other signal transduction regulators in the HepG2 tumors
from the mice treated with vehicle, sorafenib, or sorafenib plus
iRGD. Tumors from animals treated with sorafenib alone showed
a signiﬁcant decrease in phosphorylation only in a small number
of proteins as compared with tumors from vehicle-treated mice
(JNK, p38g, Creb, and AKT3; Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast,

iRGD led to a tumor-speciﬁc increase of signal intensity in Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI. TGFa/c-myc mice, in which HCC had been detected 1 week before by
Gd-EOB-DTPA–enhanced MRI, were anesthetized, followed by a basal T1–weighted MRI and immediately thereafter a Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI. Twelve to
24 hours later, either iRGD or RGD control (Ctl.) peptide (100 mL each via the tail vein containing 4 mmol/kg) was injected into the same animals, followed by a basal
and a Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI. A, schematic outline of the procedure. B, Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI of a TGFa/c-myc mice with HCC (left), followed by the

in tumors from animals cotreated with sorafenib and iRGD, the
inhibitory effect of sorafenib on kinase phosphorylation was
increased and reached signiﬁcance for most detected proteins as
compared with the vehicle-treated tumors. Only RSK1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) were not altered by
the sorafenib treatment, regardless the presence of iRGD. Creb
was inhibited to the same extent by iRGD/sorafenib and sorafenib

only (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Overall, including iRGD significantly reduced the phosphorylation of 15 of 24 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results indicate that coadministered
iRGD reinforced the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on intracellular
signaling kinases and are in good agreement with the effects of
sorafenib and sorafenib plus iRGD on the progression of the
HepG2 tumors.

Discussion
A selective increase of the tumor penetrability by iRGD might
be highly beneﬁcial in tumor therapy, as it could be used to
achieve a tumor-selective delivery of intravenously coadministered antitumor substances, thereby increasing the therapeutic
index. We found that iRGD increased the levels of the coinjected
marker substances doxorubicin or Evans Blue in the tumor tissue
of TGFa/c-myc mice with endogenously formed HCCs as well as
in HepG2 and Huh-7 xenograft–bearing nude mice by a factor of 3
without changing the levels of these substances in normal tissues.
This suggests that iRGD selectively increased the delivery of
coadministered substances into HCC tissue in the different HCC
mouse models. In other tumor models, this has been shown to
occur through an increased penetrability of the tumor stroma,

enabling systemically administered substances to penetrate deeply into the tumor (4, 5). It appears likely that this also applies to
HCC. The bystander effect of iRGD appears to avoid many of the
drawbacks of other strategies to increase the concentration of
anticancer drugs selectively in tumor tissue such as the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect or active targeting by
harnessing tumor-speciﬁc surface molecules, such as large tumorto-tumor variability, often low efﬁcacy and speciﬁcity, restriction
to a particular class of substances and tumors, or low capacity (22,
23). iRGD is well-tolerated in all studies published so far and even
inhibits tumor metastasis (10). Moreover, iRGD may enable the
penetration of systemically coadministered substances into ﬁbrotic areas in breast carcinoma xenografts (24). As HCCs arise in the
predominant number of cases in livers with advanced ﬁbrosis or

Improved Drug Penetrability with iRGD

cirrhosis (2), iRGD might be particularly useful to increase tumor
drug delivery in this tumor entity.
The efﬁcacy of iRGD to increase the penetrability of tumors for
therapeutic substances is likely to show tumor-to-tumor variation, which could be, for instance, due to differential expression of
avb3/5 integrins and NRP1 (14). Thus, a clinically feasible method
to determine whether a particular tumor can be permeabilized by
iRGD would be highly beneﬁcial for a potential translation of
iRGD into patients. Our data showing that intravenously administered iRGD led to a selective increase of the MRI signal in the
tumors, leading to a conversion of otherwise negatively contrasted
tumors to positively contrasted ones in Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI
injected in the TGFa/c-myc mice, indicates that the increased
tumor penetrability due to the action of iRGD could be detected in
vivo noninvasively by Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI, a clinical routine
procedure. Thus, Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI with and without
iRGD may offer a clinically applicable new method to examine
whether a particular tumor responds to iRGD and may thus
enable optimization of drug administration regimen. Moreover,
an altered behavior in Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI upon administration of iRGD might serve as a new selective identiﬁer for
malignant liver lesions.
Another key ﬁnding of the present study is that the tumorpermeabilizing effect of iRGD translates into an enhanced antitumor effect of sorafenib, the current standard drug in patients
with advanced HCC. Whereas sorafenib alone at the relatively
low-dose schedule used in the present study (to minimize toxicity) had only little, if any, effect on tumor progression, it strongly
reduced HCC progression when administered in combination
with iRGD. There was no indication that iRGD increased the
toxicity of sorafenib, suggesting that iRGD may indeed increase
the therapeutic index of sorafenib. iRGD is well-tolerated in other
preclinical tumor models (5, 9) and currently awaits entering early
clinical testing. Moreover, considering that RGD peptides have
low immunogenicity, the accumulated data indicate that the
combined administration of iRGD and sorafenib might be highly
beneﬁcial in HCC.
Considering the conservation of the effect of iRGD in different
human tumor xenograft and spontaneous mouse tumor models
(5) and the expression of the av integrin and NRP1 in the vessels
and the tumor cells of human HCC (6, 25–29), it appears possible
that the enhanced tumor penetrability to the drugs due to the
action of iRGD described in the present study in HCC mouse
models may translate to patients with HCC. However, this
remains to be investigated. If this would be the case, patients
with HCC may beneﬁt from an increased efﬁcacy of the sorafenib
therapy in several ways. iRGD may augment the antitumor effect
of sorafenib and prolong patient survival as compared with the
patients treated with sorafenib alone; coadministered iRGD may
increase the portion of patients responding to the sorafenib
therapy. Moreover, iRGD may allow a reduction of the dose of
sorafenib, resulting in diminishing the considerable side effects of
this drug.
Coadministered iRGD also increased the antitumor effect of
doxorubicin in HCC mice. There was no sign that iRGD increased
the toxicity of doxorubicin. This is in agreement with other studies
showing that iRGD did not increase the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (5), the main dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin. If the
tumor-permeabilizing effect of iRGD also holds for patients with

www.aacrjournals.org

HCC, it is possible that doxorubicin, although not beneﬁcial in
patients with HCC as single agent (20, 21), might be effective in
patients with HCC when administered with iRGD.
It should be noted that many aspects and details concerning the
action of iRGD and its use of Gd-DTPA–enhanced MRI for the
detection of the tumor-penetrating effect of iRGD will need
further experimentation. For instance, the efﬁcacy of combinations of iRGD with antitumor drugs might be further improved by
optimization of the peptide (30), dosing and administration
regimen, the identiﬁcation of particularly effective combinations,
and a comparison of the effect of iRGD on Gd-DTPA–enhanced
MRI and transport of the marker substances in the same animals
would enable more exact estimation of the suitability of MRI to
detect iRGD-responsive tumors.
In summary, the present study not only shows that the bystander effect of iRGD extends to HCC. We also show that the increased
penetrability of the HCCs by iRGD can be detected by a noninvasive clinical routine imaging procedure and results in a higher
therapeutic efﬁcacy of coadministered drugs. These ﬁndings render clinical development of iRGD for HCC and potentially other
tumors highly attractive.
