Abstract
Expression of a blood-cancer-associated genetic mutation only in the non-blood cells of the bone
marrow is sufficient to cause blood cancer in mice. This finding might point to new approaches to
treating an often-fatal disease. See Letter p.XXX

Author Manuscript

Mutations in blood stem cells can result in excessive production of one or more types of
mature blood cell and a type of cancer called myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). One such
disorder is juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a rare paediatric MPN characterized
by expansion of the white blood cell compartment1. Currently, JMML can be remedied only
by stem-cell transplantation, but about 50% of patients relapse following this treatment. A
more detailed understanding of the disease could lead to new therapies and improved
outcomes. In a paper online in Nature, Dong et al.2 report that mutation of the gene Ptpn11
in the non-blood cells that surround blood stem cells causes a JMML-like myeloproliferative
neoplasm (a type of white blood cell cancer) in mice, owing to altered interactions between
these two cell types.
Mutations in genes that encode proteins of the RAS–ERK signalling pathway are found in
the blood cells (but no other cells) of about 90% of patients with sporadic JMML1,3. The
most frequent of these occur in the gene PTPN11. Such mutations activate the enzyme
encoded by PTPN11, SHP2, increasing RAS–ERK signalling. Certain PTPN11 mutations
can be inherited, and so present in all cells of the body, giving rise to the developmental
disorder Noonan Syndrome4. Noonan syndrome is characterized by cardiac, facial, cognitive
and growth abnormalities, but about 20% of affected children have abnormal white blood
cell counts, and a few develop a congenital form of JMML.

Previous studies of JMML have focused on the effects of disease-associated PTPN11 in
blood cells, and have established that expression of the mutant gene in these cells alone can
promote development of a JMML-like MPN in mice5,6. Dong et al. confirmed that blood
cell-restricted expression of mutant Ptpn11 causes MPN (Fig. 1a). They next studied mice
that harbour Ptpn11 mutations only in stromal (i.e., non-blood) cell types of the bone
marrow, which surround the developing blood cells— surprisingly, these mice, which have
genetically normal blood cells, develop a disease similar to congenital JMML, in which the
mutant gene is present in all tissues.

The authors find that mutant Ptpn11 can only give rise to MPN when expressed in certain
types of stromal cells of the bone marrow (mesenchymal stem cells and the bone progenitors
that they give rise to) but not in others (mature bone or blood-vessel cells). Furthermore, if
genetically normal blood stem cells reside long enough in this noxious microenvironment,
they become fully cancerous and can give rise to MPN when transplanted into healthy mice.
Presumably, the abnormal microenvironment induces mutations (genetic alterations) or
epigenetic changes (which affect gene expression without changing DNA sequence) in
normal blood stem cells that result in this transformation.

Author Manuscript

What these changes in normal blood cells are — and whether they affect RAS–ERK
pathway genes — is an interesting question that is left unresolved. Perhaps clarifying this
issue would shed light on the causes of the approximately 5 to 10% of JMML cases for
which a genetic basis remains undefined1. For example, might these cancers be caused by
mutations in mesenchymal stem cells, rather than blood stem cells?
The finding that an abnormal bone-marrow microenvironment can promote blood disease is
not unprecedented: a variety of genetic alterations can evoke MPN or acute leukemia when
engineered into the bone marrow stromal cells of mice7. But Dong and colleagues model an
actual human disease (JMML associated with Noonan syndrome) in which an aberrant bone
marrow microenvironment is present from birth. Their results therefore suggest that an
abnormal bone-marrow microenvironment might provide the initial, and potentially the more
potent, MPN-promoting stimulus in congenital JMML.

Author Manuscript

The levels of SHP2 activation caused by PTPN11 mutation in patients can vary1,3. In people
with Noonan syndrome, only the most activating mutations cause JMML. Perhaps under
such circumstances, JMML can only develop when blood cells and the stromal
microenvironment both bear the mutant gene. A similar requirement has been reported for
another mouse model of MPN caused by a distinct type of genetic defect8.
Dong et al. find that several pro-inflammatory factors produced by mutant stromal cells,
including the protein CCL3, are present in blood serum from their mice and from patients
with Noonan syndrome. These findings suggest that such factors could serve as biomarkers
to identify children at increased risk of JMML. Furthermore, the authors find that drugs that
block CCL3 action decrease MPN development in mice (Fig. 1b). Administering such drugs
to such high-risk patients might spare them from transplantation.

Author Manuscript

The current study also has potential implications for sporadic JMML. Previous studies
showed that aberrant blood cells can send signals to stromal cells that alter the bone-marrow
microenvironment to favour their own expansion or to impede the survival, proliferation and
function of normal blood stem cells7. Dong et al. find that Ptpn11 mutant blood cells also
produce pro-inflammatory factors, suggesting a vicious cycle in which mutant blood cells
perturb the microenvironment, which, in turn, augments expansion of the cancerous bloodcell population. If bone-marrow stromal cells have been rendered abnormal by cancerous
blood cells in sporadic JMML, persistence of this abnormal microenvironment might
contribute to disease recurrence after stem-cell transplant.

Consequently, perhaps the most immediate intervention suggested by Dong and colleagues'
work is to investigate the effects of CCL3 blockers in transplant regimens for JMML
patients. One such drug, Maraviroc, is used to treat HIV infection, and also blocks graft
versus host disease (a complication of bone marrow transplantation)9. The authors find that
such agents are more effective at preventing MPN post-transplant than in combatting
established JMML in mice. Nevertheless, combining these blockers with targeted therapies
aimed at reversing the effects of increased RAS–ERK activation also could represent a
promising new therapeutic strategy for JMML.

Author Manuscript

Finally, the results of the current study resonate with, and inform, emerging themes in cancer
biology. It is becoming clear that the interactions between cancerous cells and their
microenvironment determine cancer behaviour and response to therapy. We also know that
inflammation can initiate, as well as enhance, cancer. In solid tumours, one major effect of
tumour-associated inflammation is to suppress the host immune system10. It will be
interesting to see whether therapies directed against the JMML microenvironment evoke or
augment an anti-MPN immune response.

Figure 1. Collaboration causes blood cancer

a, Mutation in the gene Ptpn11 in the blood cells of mice and humans cause the cancer
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which is one of a family of “myeloproliferative
neoplasms” (MPNs). The stromal cells that surround developing blood cells do not need to
be mutated for sporadic JMML development. b, However, Dong et al. report that expression
of mutant Ptpn11 in the stroma causes MPN in mice. These mice provide insight into a
congenital form of JMML in which the mutation is present in all cells. The mutant stromal
cells produce pro-inflammatory factors, including the protein CCL3, which cause cancerous
transformation of normal blood cells into cells of a JMML-like MPN. Stromainduced MPN
can be ameliorated (dashed lines) by drugs that block CCL3 action.
