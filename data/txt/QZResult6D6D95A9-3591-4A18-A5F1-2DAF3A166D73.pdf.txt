ABSTRACT
Acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations underlies drug resistance of chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but the molecular mechanisms of
mutation acquisition are poorly understood. We previously showed that lysine
deacetylase sirtuin 1, SIRT1, promotes acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations in association
with enhancing KU70 mediated non-homologous end joining DNA repair. In this study,
we demonstrate that lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays an opposite role to
SIRT1 in regulating DNA repair and mutation acquisition. In response to therapeutic
stress and DNA damage, LSD1 and SIRT1 compete for binding to KU70 on DNA damage
foci globally and on the ABL locus. The recruitment of SIRT1 or LSD1 to KU70 impacts
chromatin structure but does not correlate well with their direct histone modification
functions, and SIRT1 helps maintain histone H4K16 acetylation and open chromatin
for repair. The competitive KU70 binding by these proteins affects cancer cells’ ability
to repair broken DNA and acquire resistant genetic mutations in CML and prostate
cancer cells. We identify that the core domain of KU70 binds both LSD1 and SIRT1,
forming a molecular basis for the competition. The C-terminal SAP motif of KU70
mediates LSD1/SIRT1 competitive interaction by suppressing LSD1 binding to KU70
and ectopic expression of SAP-deleted KU70 to CML cells compromises their ability
to acquire BCR-ABL mutations. Our study reveals a novel cellular stress response
mechanism in cancer cells and a key role of LSD1/SIRT1/KU70 dynamic interaction
in regulating DNA repair and mutation acquisition.

by all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) increases expression of
cellular NAD+ cyclase CD38 that reduces cellular NAD+
concentration, inhibits SIRT1 activity and blocks BCRABL mutation acquisition [6].
SIRT1 is a multi-functional enzyme that deacetylates
histones including H4K16 to regulate gene expression
and many non-histone proteins for biological functions
[7]. A key downstream effector of SIRT1 is KU70, a
crucial factor for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
NHEJ is a major DNA repair mechanism in mammalian
cells for double strand breaks (DSBs) that can arise from
intrinsic sources such as reactive oxygen species or from
external sources such as cancer chemotherapeutic agents
and ionizing radiation [8]. NHEJ repair is initiated when
KU70/KU80 heterodimer binds to broken DNA ends. Both
KU factors are essential for NHEJ as deletion of either
one leads to DSB repair impairment and sensitivity to

INTRODUCTION
Transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by
the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene leads to development
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase
inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) is an effective treatment
for the disease [1], but forfeits its efficacy in some patients,
particularly those in advanced phases of the disease, due
to acquired resistance through BCR-ABL mutations [2, 3].
To dissect the mechanisms of resistance, we previously
developed a culture model with a blast crisis CML cell
line that recapitulates clinical CML acquired resistance
through BCR-ABL mutations [4]. Using this model, we
showed that NAD+ dependent protein lysine deacetylase
SIRT1 is critically involved in promoting acquisition of
BCR-ABL mutations in response to IM treatment [5]. We
also demonstrated that induction of cell differentiation

radiation [9, 10]. KU70 is subjected to lysine acetylation
modification [11], and deacetylation of KU70 by SIRT1
stimulates KU70-mediated NHEJ repair [5, 12]. Besides
its well-known function in NHEJ, KU70 has roles in nonDNA repair events, which are less understood. Among
them, SIRT1 deacetylation of KU70 sequesters BAX
protein in the cytoplasm to prevent apoptosis initiation
and extend cell survival [13]. We have shown that SIRT1
promotes acquisition of resistant BCR-ABL mutations
in CML cells in association with its ability to stimulate
aberrant NHEJ activity by deacetylating KU70 [5, 6].
Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a
monoamine oxidase homolog that demethylates histone
H3K4 and H3K9 [14-16], and functions to regulate gene
expression [17, 18]. LSD1 also demethylates non-histone
proteins such as p53 for regulating cell survival [19].
Previously, we demonstrated that p53 deacetylation by
SIRT1 plays a key role for drug resistance of CML stem/
progenitor cells [20, 21]. Therefore, both LSD1 and SIRT1
can target on the same non-histone protein to modulate
its functions. In addition, SIRT1 and LSD1 can co-exist
within a repressor complex to regulate gene transcription
[22]. However, it is unknown if LSD1 can regulate NHEJ
and KU70 functions. We initially hypothesized that SIRT1
and LSD1 may co-regulate KU70 for NHEJ and mutation
acquisition. Surprisingly, we discovered that SIRT1 and
LSD1 compete for binding to KU70 in cancer cells in
response to stress and have opposing roles in mediating
NHEJ repair and mutation acquisition in CML and nonCML cells.

increased interaction of KU70 with SIRT1 and reduced
interaction with LSD1 occurred in KCL-22 cells treated
with H2O2 and DNA damage agent camptothecin (CPT)
(Figure 1C). Similar effects were also observed in KCL22 cells after γ-irradiation, but to a lesser degree (Figure
1D). These results indicate that opposite SIRT1 and LSD1
interaction with KU70 may be a part of cellular stress
response in cancer cells, especially for chemical-induced
stress and damage.
We next examined if altered KU70-SIRT1-LSD1
interaction could occur on DNA damage foci. By confocal
imaging, we found that in KCL-22 cells KU70 largely
aggregated on DNA damage foci marked by γH2AX
after CPT treatment or γ-irradiation (Figure 2A). SIRT1
robustly co-localized with KU70 on these foci in CPT
treated cells, and SIRT1 also co-localized with KU70
upon γ-irradiation but to a lesser degree than in CPT
treated cells (Figure 2B). Although reduction of LSD1
interaction with KU70 was difficult to see in this assay,
lack of co-localization of LSD1 with many KU70 foci
upon damage was clearly evident (Figure 2C). These
findings are consistent with co-IP results described
above. In contrast, in non-resistant cell line KU812 cells,
LSD1 co-localization with KU70 foci was substantially
enhanced upon CPT treatment or γ-irradiation (Figure 3A,
3C). Intriguingly, recruitment of SIRT1 to KU70 foci also
occurred after DNA damage, but it is difficult to judge
whether there was quantitative reduction of its interaction
with KU70 overall by imaging (Figure 3B). Nevertheless,
the results suggest that differential KU70-SIRT1-LSD1
interaction occurs on DNA damage foci, particularly in
the cells capable of acquiring resistant mutations.
KCL-22 cells acquire T315I mutation of BCR-ABL
for IM resistance [4]. We examined how KU70-SIRT1LSD1 may be recruited on the ABL exon 6 where T315I
mutation occurs. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay, we found that both LSD1 and SIRT1
occupied exon 6 of the ABL locus in untreated KCL-22
cells; upon IM treatment, the exon 6-bound LSD1 was
reduced, but the abundance of SIRT1 was increased
(Figure 4A, 4B). The levels of the exon 6-bound KU70
remained constant in untreated and IM treated cells. By
contrast, in KU812 cells, the ABL exon 6-bound SIRT1
was reduced whereas LSD1 was increased following IM
treatment (Figure 4C). The results on the ABL locus are
consistent with that SIRT1 and LSD1 oppositely interact
with KU70 globally in response to IM.
We carried out ChIP of active chromatin mark
H4K16Ac in part as a positive control for KU70-SIRT1LSD1 ChIP and to determine the impact of SIRT1
recruitment on local chromatin since BCR-ABL is actively
transcribed in all CML cells. We found that H4K16Ac was
comparably enriched on the ABL exon 6 in both KCL22 and KU812 cells without IM treatment (Figure 4D,
4E), indicating active chromatin in these cells. Upon IM
treatment, however, H4K16Ac was increased at 24 h and

RESULTS
Opposing interaction with KU70 by LSD1 and
SIRT1 in CML cells in response to stress and its
impact on chromatin and DNA damage
Our initial co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) pilot
study indicated that both SIRT1 and LSD1 interacted
with KU70. We set out to determine the potential roles
of LSD1 and SIRT1 in regulation of KU70 in CML cell
drug resistance. We used the KCL-22 cell model of CML
acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that we
previously developed [4]. By co-IP assay, we examined
how SIRT1 and LSD1 may interact with KU70 in response
to IM treatment. As shown in Figure 1A, KU70 interaction
with SIRT1 was increased after IM treatment. Surprisingly,
KU70 was bound to LSD1 in the untreated cells, but
significantly dissociated from LSD1 after IM treatment.
In contrast to KCL-22 cells, CML cell lines KU812 and
K562 are unable to acquire BCR-ABL mutations for
resistance [4]. Interestingly, opposite KU70 interaction
pattern was observed in these cells, i.e. KU70 was bound
to SIRT1 in the untreated KU812 (Figure 1B) and K562
(Supplementary Figure S1) cells, but after IM treatment,
KU70 became more associated with LSD1. Similar to IM,

then decreased at 48 h, within 2-fold change in KCL-22
cells (Figure 4D), likely reflecting a chromatin dynamics
seen during DNA repair [23, 24]. Surprisingly, H4K16Ac
was substantially reduced for more than 10 fold by 24
h IM treatment in KU812 cells (Figure 4E) in spite of
reduced recruitment of SIRT1 onto the locus. Therefore
we further examined histone marks H3K4Me2 and
H3K9Me2, both substrates of LSD1, on the ABL exon 6.
Both dimethylation marks were readily detected in KCL22 cells, and they changed only moderately with and
without IM (Figure 4F). In contrast, both dimethylation
marks were low in untreated KU812 cells, and were
robustly increased upon IM treatment first by H3K9Me2
and then H3K4Me2 (Figure 4G). These indicate some
baseline difference of the BCR-ABL locus chromatin and
the response to IM in these cell lines. Sharp reduction
of active mark H4K16Ac and surge of repressive mark
H3K9Me2 may indicate formation of “repressive”
chromatin structures upon DNA damage in KU812 cells.

However, BCR-ABL mRNA levels did not change until a
much later time (Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting
that chromatin change may be related with DNA repair
but not transcription.
The observed changes of chromatin marks are not
quite consistent with classical functions of SIRT1 and
LSD1 in histone modifications, especially for SIRT1
that is expected to deacetylate histone H4K16. In mouse
embryonic stem cells and solid tumor cells, SIRT1
knockout or knockdown did not change global histone
H4 acetylation [25, 26]; but upon DNA damage, SIRT1
can relocalize on chromatin and result in local changes of
H4K16 acetylation and gene expression [12, 27]. However,
how SIRT1 affects histone acetylation in hematological
cells is not clear. We examined histone H4K16 acetylation
in CML cells with SIRT1 gene knockdown in the absence
and presence of DNA damage. By flow cytometry,
we found that in the absence of DNA damage SIRT1
knockdown by shRNA increased global H4K16Ac in

KCL-22 as expected; but in the presence of H2O2 or CPT,
SIRT1 knockdown surprisingly reduced global H4K16Ac
(Figure 5A). These results were confirmed by Western
blot analysis (Figure 5B). Due to the difficulty in shRNA
transduction of KU812 cells, we performed a similar
study in IM-sensitive K562 cells. Likewise, we found that
SIRT1 knockdown reduced H4K16Ac when the cells were
under oxidative damage (Supplementary Figure S3). These
findings suggest that SIRT1 may have distinct functions on
histone modification under different conditions: reducing
histone H4 acetylation under unstressed condition and

increasing H4 acetylation under stressed condition.
“Repressive” chromatin is considered unfavorable for
DNA repair [28]. Therefore, SIRT1 recruitment to KU70
under stress may increase deacetylation of KU70 and
possibly also modify other factors in the repair complex
to maintain open chromatin for repair.
Because differential KU70-SIRT1-LSD1 interaction
is likely not restricted to one chromatin locus as indicated
by co-IP assay, we hypothesized that the “repressive”
chromatin orchestrated by KU70-SIRT1-LSD1 interaction,
if extended beyond the ABL locus, could reduce overall

DNA repair and result in more DNA damage in KU812
cells. We tested this by the comet assay of KCL-22 and
KU812 cells. Indeed, KU812 sustained substantially more
DNA damage than KCL-22 cells in response to the same
DNA damage treatment (Figure 6A). Consistently, KU812
cells had much higher cell death rate under DNA damage
than KCL-22 cells (not shown).
T315I mutation on the ABL exon 6 is exclusively
acquired in KCL-22 cells in response to IM, and the BCRABL translocation locus has higher mutagenesis potential
than other chromosomal loci [4]. To determine if the

exon 6 has any difference from other ABL exons to DNA
damage, we analyzed oxidative DNA damage by ChIP
of 8-oxodeoxyguanine (8-Oxo-dG) in KCL-22 cells in
response to IM. We found that the exon 6 had the highest
spontaneous 8-Oxo-dG level among four ABL exons (4,
6, 8 and 10) analyzed, and also had the highest 8-Oxo-dG
levels upon IM treatment, supporting its unique position for
acquiring T315I mutation (Figure 6B). Spontaneous 8-OxodG level on the exon 6 was also much higher than on the
β-actin locus. As a positive control, we treated the cells
with H2O2, and found that 8-Oxo-dG was proportionally

increased on both β-actin locus and ABL exon 6, but
the latter was subjected to much higher net increase of
8-Oxo-dG (Figure 6B, right panel). Interestingly, 8-OxodG increase after IM treatment peaked at 24 h and then
declined. This peak of oxidative DNA damage is in line
with our previous observation that full block of BCR-ABL
mutation acquisition by ATRA requires administration of
ATRA not later than 24 h after initiation of IM treatment
[6]. The ABL exon 4 was subjected to the second highest
level of IM-induced oxidative damage (Figure 6B).
Consistently, SIRT1 and LSD1 recruitment to the exon 4
was similarly altered to a certain degree (Supplementary
Figure S4), indicating its potential for mutagenesis. In
line with this, acquisition of exon 4 mutations E255K and
Y253H can occur in subclones of KCL-22 cells [4], and
as detailed below, robust knockdown of LSD1 could also
trigger mutations on the exon 4.

KCL-22 based NHEJ reporter cell line we engineered
[5], we knocked down LSD1 and SIRT1 by shRNA
individually and in combination. LSD1 and SIRT1
knockdown did not affect each other’s gene expression,
but LSD1 knockdown increased histone H3K4Me2 as
expected (Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure S5). LSD1
knockdown enhanced, whereas SIRT1 knockdown reduced,
NHEJ repair efficiency; double knockdown negated each
individual’s effect and returned the repair efficiency to
the level of the scrambled shRNA control (Figure 7B).
Likewise, treatment of NHEJ reporter cells with a LSD1
inhibitor, 2-Phenylcyclopropylamine (2-PCPA), enhanced
repair efficiency in a dose dependent manner (Figure 7C).
Furthermore, 2-PCPA treatment of SIRT1 knockdown
reporter cells was able to return the repair efficiency to
untreated scrambled control cells (Figure 7C). Consistently,
lentiviral expression of WT LSD1 reduced NHEJ repair
efficiency, while expression of demethylase-defective
K661A LSD1 increased NHEJ efficiency (Figure 7D).
These results show that SIRT1 and LSD1 oppositely
regulate NHEJ repair, and lysine demethylase activity of
LSD1 is required for such an action.
We next examined the roles of LSD1 in BCR-ABL
mutation acquisition and IM resistance in CML cells.
Knockdown of LSD1 in KCL-22 cells only moderately
reduced cell proliferation, increased G2/M arrest and

Next, we examined if interplay of SIRT1-LSD1KU70 may actually affect KU70-mediated NHEJ repair.
We previously showed that SIRT1 inhibition blocks
BCR-ABL mutation acquisition, which is associated with
reduction of KU70-mediated NHEJ repair [5]. Using the

increased apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S6). More
significant growth inhibition and apoptosis induction after
LSD1 knockdown or treatment with 2-PCPA were observed
in acute myeloid leukemia cell line TF-1 (Supplementary
Figure S7), consistent with previous findings [29, 30].
Despite reduced colony formation of KCL-22 cells on soft
agar after LSD1 knockdown (i.e. the plating efficiency),
we found that IM-resistant mutant colony formation as
a result of BCR-ABL mutations in LSD1 knockdown
KCL-22 cells did not reduce or even increased, and when
normalized to the plating efficiency, the relative mutant
colony formation was significantly increased (Figure 8A
and Supplementary Figure S8A). Similar results were
seen with chemical inhibition of LSD1 by 2-PCPA (Figure
8B and Supplementary Figure S8B). In contrast to LSD1
knockdown, SIRT1 knockdown completely blocked IMresistant colony formation, and the combination of SIRT1
and LSD1 knockdown neutralized each other’s effect
(Figure 8C), similar to that for NHEJ repair described above.

We further examined the effect of over-expression
of WT and catalytically inactive K661A LSD1 in KCL-22
cells. Cell apoptosis analyzed by annexin V labeling was
not affected by either WT or K661A LSD1 expression in
the presence or absence of IM treatment (data not shown).
Ectopic expression of K661A LSD1 increased BCRABL mutation frequency (Figure 8D), and K661A LSD1
expressing KCL-22 cells showed quicker relapse in liquid
culture (Figure 8E); however, we did not observe such an
effect of WT LSD1 over-expression. The lack of effect of
WT LSD1 expression is possibly due to abundant presence
of LSD1 on the ABL locus (Figure 4A, 4B) that would make
it more difficult to have an impact by ectopic WT LSD1,
whereas K661A LSD1 may have a dominant negative effect.
To determine if resistant clones after LSD1
knockdown or 2-PCPA treatment also acquire genetic
mutations, we sequenced BCR-ABL exons. Indeed
nearly all resistant clones acquired BCR-ABL mutations
(Supplementary Figure S9A). Interestingly, whereas most

resistant clones had T315I mutation on the exon 6 as
expected, clones from one set of knockdown (shLSD1b)
mostly acquired Y253H mutation on the exon 4. Although
the precise reason why shLSD1b yielded different
mutation spectrum is unclear, we noticed shLSD1b
tended to yield more efficient LSD1 knockdown in KCL-

22 cells (Supplementary Figure S9B). This suggests that
a threshold level of LSD1 might be needed to maintain
chromatin functions and mutagenesis on the exon 6 as
described above. In line with this note, one resistant clone
from a higher concentration of 2-PCPA treatment did not
acquire T315I mutation (Supplementary Figure S9A).

LSD1 and SIRT1 oppositely regulate HPRT
mutation acquisition in prostate cancer cells

of KU70/LSD1 interaction domains (Supplementary
Figure S11).
Co-IP assays of Myc-tagged KU70 revealed that the
core domain (262-464) of KU70 primarily mediated the
interaction with flag-tagged SIRT1. The KU70 N-terminus
did not bind SIRT1 but acted as a strong repressor for
SIRT1 binding to the core (Figure 10A, 10C). SIRT1
only very weakly interacted with the C-terminal regions
of KU70, but the sequence (464-573) between the core
and SAP domains, which harbors the nuclear localization
signal (NLS) and linker, was a positive regulatory domain
for SIRT1 interaction and antagonized the repression from
the N-terminus (Figure 10A, 10C). Noticeably, the NLS/
linker region has multiple sites for lysine acetylation, two
of which are targeted by SIRT1 [11, 13].
Given that the KU70 core mediated strong interaction
with both SIRT1 and LSD1, we hypothesized that LSD1
and SIRT1 may competitively bind to KU70. To test this,
we titrated the amount of either flagged-SIRT1 or HALSD1 for transfection aiming to compete out the binding
of the other to Myc-KU70. After co-expressing three
constructs in differing molar ratios in 293T cells, we found
that the more SIRT1 was present, the less relative LSD1
bound to KU70, and vice versa (Figure 10D). Consistently,
under equal molar ratio ΔSAP KU70 had stronger
interaction with LSD1 than WT KU70, and conversely
WT KU70 had stronger interaction with SIRT1 than ΔSAP
KU70. These results suggest a competition of LSD1 and
SIRT1 for binding to KU70 as summarized in Figure 10E.

We next determined the roles of LSD1 and SIRT1
in regulating mutation acquisition in other genes and
cell types. We first performed hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) mutation assays
in KCL-22 cells with LSD1 knockdown. We found
that spontaneous HPRT mutation frequency in KCL22 measured by 6-thioguanine (6-TG) resistant colony
formation was significantly increased with LSD1 shRNAs
compared to scrambled control (Figure 9A), an effect
opposite to SIRT1 knockdown we showed before [5].
We then examined HPRT mutations in prostate cancer
PC3 cells with LSD1, SIRT1, combined LSD1/SIRT1 or
scrambled shRNA knockdown. Since PC3 cells have a
relatively low spontaneous mutation rate [5], we treated
these cells with CPT to induce DNA damage. LSD1
knockdown significantly increased formation of 6-TG
resistant plaques in spite of a reduced plating efficiency,
while SIRT1 knockdown largely abolished resistant plaque
formation without significantly affecting the plating
efficiency; combined LSD1/SIRT1 knockdown partially
restored 6-TG resistant plaque numbers relative to SIRT1
knockdown alone, 27.4±13.4 vs 4.2±3.7, respectively
(mean±SEM; Figure 9B and Supplementary Figure
S10). Together, these data suggest that LSD1 and SIRT1
oppositely regulate cellular NHEJ repair and acquisition

LSD1 and SIRT1 competitive interaction with
KU70 regulates BCR-ABL mutation acquisition

LSD1 and SIRT1 compete for interaction with
KU70

To further determine if LSD1/SIRT1 competitive
interaction with KU70 may indeed affect BCR-ABL
mutation acquisition, we over-expressed WT or ΔSAP
KU70 into CML cells. However, our multiple efforts to
over-express KU70 in CML cells failed, possibly because
KU70 is one of the most abundant proteins in human cells
[33] or its expression is under tight control. To aid ectopic
KU70 expression, we designed shRNA targeting KU70 3’
untranslated region (3’UTR) to reduce endogenous KU70
without affecting ectopic KU70 cDNA. In addition, to
help visualize ectopic KU70 expression and transduction
efficiency, we made EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent
protein) fusion to KU70. EGFP-KU70 fusion preserves
KU70 functions to be properly targeted to laser–induced
DNA damage sites [34]. KCL-22 cells were transduced
with lentiviral expression vectors for EGFP-KU70 (WT
or ΔSAP mutant), enriched by puromycin selection,
and followed by KU70 3’UTR shRNA knockdown.
Using this strategy, EGFP-KU70 (WT and mutant) were
expressed to the levels about same as that of the remaining
endogenous KU70 (Figure 11A). We found that KU70
3’UTR knockdown reduced BCR-ABL mutant formation,
which was completely rescued by WT KU70 expression;

To determine the mechanisms how SIRT1 and
LSD1 oppositely interact with KU70 and regulate its
functions, we mapped the domains within KU70 that
are responsible for interaction with LSD1 and SIRT1,
respectively. We engineered several Myc-tagged human
KU70 constructs (Figure 10A) and co-expressed each
with HA-tagged WT LSD1 in 293T cells. Co-IP assays
with anti-Myc resin showed that LSD1 bound robustly to
the core domain (262-464) of KU70 and partially to the
N-terminus, and KU70 lacking the N-terminal domain
(ΔN257) only weakly interacted with LSD1 (Figure 10A,
10B). Interestingly, deletion of the SAP domain (574609) at the C-terminus of KU70, a domain that may help
KU70-DNA interaction [31] and mediate BAX protein
interaction for cell survival [32], dramatically increased
KU70 interaction with LSD1, indicating that SAP was
a strong repressor motif for LSD1 interaction (Figure
10A, 10B). An unexpected variation of input HA-LSD1
expression was noticed when it was co-transfected with
KU70 constructs (Figure 10B). This was reproduced in
independent mappings, but it did not affect the conclusions

DISCUSSION

in contrast, ΔSAP KU70 mutant had significantly lower
capability to restore BCR-ABL mutations (Figure 11B).
These results are consistent with stronger LSD1 interaction
with ΔSAP KU70 that reduces SIRT1 interaction and
thus KU70 activation. All together, our data support that
competitive interaction of KU70 by LSD1 and SIRT1 in
cancer cells in response to stress regulates NHEJ repair
and mutation acquisition.

In this study, we identified a novel cellular stress
signaling mechanism in which lysine deacetylase SIRT1
and demethylase LSD1 competitively binds to KU70 in
response to chemotherapeutic agents and DNA damage.
Such competitive KU70 binding affects a cancer cell’s
ability to repair broken DNA and acquire genetic

mutations. Both SIRT1 and LSD1 strongly bind to the
KU70 core domain, providing a molecular basis for
such competition. These findings shed new insight of
CML acquired resistance and may help better understand
mutation acquisition process under stress conditions and
genetic evolution of cancer.
We showed that differential recruitment of SIRT1
and LSD1 to KU70 occurred on DNA damage foci
globally, as well as locus-specifically on the ABL exon 6
where the BCR-ABL mutation (T315I) hot spot is located.
Although SIRT1 and LSD1 are known histone modifiers,
their recruitment to the chromatin locus in response to
stress did not correlate well with the expected histone
mark changes, suggesting their main roles under stress
are not to directly modify histones. This is particularly
evident that SIRT1 knockdown increased H4K16Ac under
non-stressed condition, but reduced H4K16Ac under
stress. In terms of chromatin, the recruitment of SIRT1
to DNA damage foci possibly would modify other factors
to maintain open chromatin for DNA repair. This can be
further coupled with SIRT1 deacetylation of KU70 to
enhance repair. However, the enhanced repair is ostensibly
associated with generation of rare genetic mutations for
drug resistance. In contrast, increased recruitment of
LSD1 at the expense of SIRT1 to DNA damage foci would
lead to “repressive” chromatin that is not favorable for
repair, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage (Figure
11C), and cells with sustained DNA damage would die.
However, knockdown of LSD1 alone was insufficient
to convert IM-sensitive cell lines to acquire BCR-ABL
mutations for resistance (data not shown), suggesting that
additional chromatin regulatory factors are involved in the
process.
Both SIRT1 and LSD1 target lysines for protein
modification, such as in the case of p53 [19, 35]. It is
tempting to speculate that LSD1 may demethylate some
same lysine residues on KU70 as SIRT1 deacetylates for
their competitive regulation of KU70 functions. A recent
proteomic study identifying lysine methylation of KU70
and several other DNA repair factors [36] further suggests
such a possibility. However, whether KU70 is a methylated
protein remains to be validated and whether LSD1 can
demethylate KU70 for regulating NHEJ warrants further
investigation. As mentioned above, it is also possible
that LSD1 may target factors other than KU70 within
the NHEJ repair complex. In this aspect, LSD1/SIRT1
competitive interaction with KU70 would still serve as
a mechanism to modulate SIRT1 activation of KU70
functions. Regardless, our findings raise a possibility that
KU70-mediated NHEJ is subjected to dynamic epigenetic
regulation in response to cellular stress. In addition, we
speculate that LSD1/SIRT1 competitive interaction with
KU70 may have an impact on other KU70 functions
beyond DNA repair, such as certain gene expression and
cell survival.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In response to IM treatment, increased binding of
KU70 to SIRT1 and reduced binding to LSD1 occur on
the ABL locus in relapse-prone cells. Such switching
correlates with enhanced DNA damage repair and
acquisition of T315I mutation on the locus in these
cells whereas the opposite change occurs in CML cell
lines unable to acquire resistant mutations. Interestingly,
spontaneous oxidative DNA damage was detected on the
ABL exon 6, and SIRT1, LSD1 and KU70 were found
on the locus even in the absence of TKI treatment stress.
Exon 6 is also subjected to the highest level of oxidative
DNA damage upon IM stress. These findings explain
why the exon 6 is a hot spot for T315I mutation and lend
support to our previous prediction that the endogenous
BCR-ABL locus may have ongoing spontaneous DNA
damage and repair under the steady state, which may
be perturbed by environmental stress, accentuating
mutagenesis processes [37]. SIRT1 can be recruited to
sites of DNA damage [12, 27] and Mosammaparast et al
showed that LSD1 is recruited to DNA damage foci in
the S/G2 phase [38]. It is possible that spontaneous DNA
damage on the BCR-ABL locus triggers recruitment of
LSD1, SIRT1 and KU70, although the source of such
damage remains to be determined. Imatinib treatment
of CML cells quickly causes cell cycle arrest at G0/
G1 [39] where NHEJ operates predominantly [40], but
the treatment stress elicits a new wave of modification
of DNA repair in arrested cells by altering LSD1 and
SIRT1 interaction with KU70 and likely changing repair
kinetics and fidelity, which has crucial impact on mutation
acquisition. However, detailed signaling mechanisms for
competitive KU70 binding by LSD1 and SIRT1 remain to
be determined.
Although both SIRT1 and LSD1 inhibition leads to
suppression of cell growth and soft agar colony formation,
the mutation frequency is increased with LSD1 inhibition
but reduced with SIRT1 inhibition. This difference is also
evident on actual mutant colony formation even without
normalization to the plating efficiency, regardless of that
the knockdown of these genes has more or less impact on
the plating efficiency. The change of BCR-ABL mutation
frequency upon SIRT1 or LSD1 alteration is correlated
with the change of NHEJ repair efficiency. However, it
is currently unclear how NHEJ is molecularly associated
with acquisition of point mutations of BCR-ABL, given
that NHEJ is generally believed to produce insertions and
deletions. Interestingly, Jan Vijg and colleagues showed
that LacZ reporter mice deficient in NHEJ with Ku80
knockout have significantly reduced point mutations in
liver and brain and moderately reduced point mutations
in spleen, and importantly these point mutations contain
largely base substitutions [41]. Reduction of point
mutations in liver and brain was also reported by a
different group using the same mice [42]. Although the
mechanisms for reduction of those point mutations with

50209

defective NHEJ in vivo are also unknown, their findings
are consistent with our finding of reduced BCR-ABL
mutations upon inhibiting NHEJ in the KCL-22 CML
cell model. Furthermore, Jan Vijg and colleagues showed
that acute H2O2 treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts
derived from the Ku80-/- mice do not lead to a significant
change of mutations as compared to Ku80+/+ fibroblasts,
and suggested that in vivo accumulation of mutations
over time may account for the difference of mutation
frequencies in mouse organs [41]. In cancer cells, however,
we speculate that much accelerated genome evolution with
altered DNA repair systems would occur, and this in turn
allows rapid detection of change of mutation rate upon
NHEJ inhibition in cell culture. With that said, however,
we did not find point mutations by Sanger sequencing
of EJ5 NHEJ reporter products in CML cells (data not
shown). This may be due to the limited number of clones
(<100) we analyzed, but it also remains possible that
changes of KU70/80 may impact on other repair pathway
functions to indirectly affect point mutations.
Although blockade of LSD1 inhibits tumor growth
and induces apoptosis, LSD1 inhibition enhances the
cancer cell’s NHEJ repair activity, which may contribute
to acquisition of resistant mutations. In this regard, it
is known that NHEJ pathway is aberrantly activated
in myeloid leukemia that contributes to chromosomal
rearrangements and chemoresistance [43, 44]. Besides,
LSD1 inhibition promotes hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cell expansion and prevents differentiation and maturation
[45, 46]. Our results along with those of others may imply
potential unintended consequences of anti LSD1 therapies
for certain neoplastic diseases. Further study in patients
will be needed to corroborate this. Nevertheless, our study
sheds novel insight of SIRT1/LSD1/KU70 signaling
and functions in cancer cells under therapeutic and
environmental stress, and helps understand mechanisms
of cancer drug resistance.

sheared by sonication and diluted 1:10 in IP buffer
for immunoprecipitation. Protein A/G beads (Santa

SDS followed by reverse cross-linking and proteinase
K digestion. ChIP DNA was purified using phenol/
chloroform extraction method. For PCR amplification
of ChIP DNA, Taq Red PCR mix (Sigma) was used for
30 cycles and PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose
gel. For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), SYBR green
master mix (KAPA Biosystems) was used and run in a
BioRad iCycler. The following antibodies were used for
ChIP: LSD1 (Cell Signaling, cat#2184), SIRT1 (Abcam,

cat#ab32521) and, 8-Oxo-deoxyGuanine (Trevigen, cat#
4354-MC-050).

Comet assay
The assay was performed with the Comet Assay
Kit (TREVIGEN #4250-050-K) per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the cells were harvested and mixed
with molten LM Agarose at 1×105/mL at 37°C at ratio
of 1:10 (v/v), and 50 μL mixture was immediately added
onto CometSlide. After gelling, the slides were immersed
in 4°C lysis solution for 60 min and then incubated in
alkaline unwinding solution for 20 min. Then the slides
were placed in electrophoresis tray with 4°C alkaline
electrophoresis solution and run 30 min at 25 V. The
slides were gently rinsed with water and incubated in
70% ethanol for 5 min. The slides were dried at 37°C and
then stained with 100 μL diluted SYBR Gold solution
for 30 min in dark. After rinse briefly in water, the slides
were dried completely at 37°C and ready for imaging by
fluorescent microscopy. The images were analyzed by
Comet Assay software (Perceptive Instruments) and the
percentage of tail DNA was measured to evaluate the DNA
damage.

Mutation frequency, relapse and HPRT assays
These assays were performed as previously
described [4, 5]. Briefly, for IM resistance, 1x106 KCL22 cells were plated in soft agar with 2.5μM IM in a
6-well plate. Separately, 500 KCL-22 cells were seeded
in soft agar without IM and the colony formation rate
was referred to as the plating efficiency. At 21 days post
seeding, cells are stained with crystal violet and counted.
The mutation frequency is calculated as the number of TKI
resistant colonies in the IM treated relative to the plating
efficiency for each experimental condition. Another assay
to measure acquired TKI resistance in KCL-22 cells is by
measuring cell proliferation in liquid culture with 2.5 μM
IM and counting viable cells using trypan blue exclusion
every 3 days. For this assay, 5x105 KCL-22 cells were
seeded in a 1mL of culture medium with IM in a 24 well
plate.
For
Hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mutation assays, KCL-22
and PC3 cells were treated with HAT (Hypoxanthine,
Aminopterin, Thymidine; Sigma) containing RPMI-1640
medium followed by recovery with HT medium without
aminopterin to screen out cells that contain pre-existing
HPRT mutations. [4] For KCL-22 cells, no mutagenesis
induction was necessary, whereas PC3 cells were treated
with 0.5μM camptothecin (CPT, Sigma) for 1 h to induce
mutagenesis. To quantify spontaneous mutation frequency
in KCL-22 cells, 1x106 cells were seeded with 40μM
6-thioguanine 6-thioguanine (6-TG) in soft agar on a
6-well plate. For plating efficiency, 500 cells were seeded
in soft agar without 6-TG selection. For PC3 cells, 1.5x107
cells were seeded on 150mm plates with 2.5μg/mL 6-TG.
For plating efficiency, 500 PC3 cells were seeded on a
6-well plate. Cells were stained with crystal violet and
counted. Relative mutation frequency was computed by
the number of 6-TG resistant clones relative to the plating
efficiency.

Flow cytometry analysis of histone H4K16
acetylation
Cells were treated with CPT or H2O2 as indicated.
The cells were harvested, spun down and washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were stained
with DAPI for 5 min and washed with PBS. Then the cells
were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min
at room temperature, followed by washing with PBS. The
cells were then permeabilized with PBS supplied with
0.5% triton X-100 and 5% BSA. After that the cells were
incubated with anti-acetylated H4K16 antibody (Millipore,
#07-329) at dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4°C on a shaker.
After wash with PBS for 3 times, the cells were stained
with a second fluorescent antibody (Alexa Fluor 594) at
dilution of 1:1000 for 1 hour. The cells were washed 3
times and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP was performed as previously described
[47]. Briefly, 1x107 CML cells were cross-linked
with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Reactions were
