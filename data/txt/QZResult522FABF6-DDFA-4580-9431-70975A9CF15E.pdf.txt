Abstract
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. On the basis of its histopathology and molecular-genomic changes, ovarian cancer has been divided into subtypes, each with distinct
biology and outcome. The aim of this study was to develop a panel of patient-derived EOC xenografts that
recapitulate the molecular and biologic heterogeneity of human ovarian cancer. Thirty-four EOC xenografts
were successfully established, either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, in nude mice. The xenografts were
histologically similar to the corresponding patient tumor and comprised all the major ovarian cancer
subtypes. After orthotopic transplantation in the bursa of the mouse ovary, they disseminate into the organs
of the peritoneal cavity and produce ascites, typical of ovarian cancer. Gene expression analysis and mutation
status indicated a high degree of similarity with the original patient and discriminate different subsets of
xenografts. They were very responsive, responsive, and resistant to cisplatin, resembling the clinical situation
in ovarian cancer. This panel of patient-derived EOC xenografts that recapitulate the recently type I and type
II classiﬁcation serves to study the biology of ovarian cancer, identify tumor-speciﬁc molecular markers, and
develop novel treatment modalities. Cancer Res; 74(23); 6980–90. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for 90% of ovarian
cancer and is the most lethal gynecologic cancer in western
countries accounting for more than 13,000 deaths/years (1).
Even with optimal treatment, consisting of surgical cytoreduction (debulking) followed by platinum- and taxane-based
chemotherapy, the 5-year survival for women with advanced
stage disease is only 46% at best (2).
On the basis of histology and IHC analysis, ﬁve main subtypes of EOC can be recognized: high-grade serous carcinoma
(70%), endometrioid carcinoma (10%), clear cell carcinoma
(10%), mucinous carcinoma (3%), and low-grade serous carcinoma (<5%). The different histologic subtypes of EOC are

unique entities as indicated by differences in epidemiologic
and genetic risk factors, and each has its own distinct biologic
behavior (precursion lesions, pattern of tumor spread,
response to chemotherapy and prognosis; refs. 3, 4). In recent
years, the remarkable progress in understanding the molecular
and cellular biology of ovarian cancer has brought to classify
EOC in two main categories based on the pattern of tumor
progression and molecular genetic alterations (3, 5–7). Type I
EOCs include low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid,
mucinous, and a subset of clear cell carcinomas; they are
genetically stable and relatively indolent. Most of the type II
are high-grade serous and endometrioid carcinomas with an
aggressive clinical course, genetically unstable, and frequently
mutated in TP53 (8, 9).
The scarcity of in vivo preclinical models that closely reproduce the complexity and heterogeneity of ovarian cancer limits
the development of new therapeutic strategies. Preclinical
models of ovarian cancer rely on in vitro stabilized cancer cell
lines, on tumor xenografts obtained from in vitro cell lines and,
to a lesser extent, on patient-derived tumors (10, 11). Cancer
cell lines are reproducible, easy to use, and useful for studying
speciﬁc mechanisms, but their resemblance to the original
tumor and thus their therapeutic predictive value is very
limited (12). Two studies describing ovarian cancer patientderived xenografts have been recently published (13, 14).
However, in those studies little characterization was carried
out in relation to the recently proposed origin and pathogenesis of ovarian cancer (i.e., type I or type II), that is now basis for
novel target therapy. Recently, genetically engineered mouse

Patient-Derived Ovarian Carcinoma Xenografts

(GEM) models of ovarian cancer have been obtained more
closely resembling the origin and initiation of human ovarian
cancer; however, we are still a long way from chemotherapeutic
trials (8, 15, 16).
New preclinical ovarian cancer models are needed to foster
and if possible to tumor-tailor drug development. Preclinical
models based on xenografts obtained by engraftment of
patient-derived tumor samples directly into animals rely on
their limited dissimilarity from the patient's tumor (17–19).
Because ovarian tumors are known for their pathologic and
biologic heterogeneity, with considerable differences in histology, genetics, and sensitivity to chemotherapy, the ideal preclinical model of ovarian cancer should consist of tumor
xenografts that recapitulate this heterogeneity and preserve
the characteristics of the original tumor. We report the establishment of transplantable patient-derived ovarian tumor
grafts (EOC xenografts) that retain the original patients'
molecular and biologic features. Our investigation supports
the use of this platform to develop novel treatment opportunities for ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Specimen collection and clinical data
One hundred thirty-eight clinical specimens (primary ovarian tumors, metastasis, ascitic ﬂuid) were obtained from
patients undergoing surgery for ovarian tumor by laparotomy
or paracentesis at the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy.
Tumor specimens were engrafted in nude mice within 24
hours, as described below. The study protocol for tissue
collection and clinical information was approved by the Institutional Review Board and patients provided written informed
consent authorizing the collection and use of the tissue for
study purposes. Detailed information is reported in the Supplementary Data section.
Animals
Female NCr-nu/nu mice obtained from Harlan Laboratories
were used when 6 to 8 weeks old. Mice were maintained under
speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions, housed in isolated vented
cages, and handled using aseptic procedures. Procedures
involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity
with institutional guidelines at the IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche
Farmacologiche Mario Negri, in compliance with national and
international laws and policies and in line with Guidelines for
the Welfare and Use of Animals in Cancer Research (20).
Ovarian carcinoma xenografts
Routinely solid specimens from tumor masses (ovary and
omentum) were engrafted subcutaneously (s.c.), whereas ascites were transplanted intraperitoneally (i.p.) as tumor suspension (Table 1). The ability of EOC xenografts to disseminate and
metastasize was tested from intraperitoneal and intrabursal
transplantations as detailed below.
Subcutis models. Primary tumors and metastases were
dissected free of necrotic tissue repeatedly rinsed in HBSS and
2 to 4 mm of tissue was implanted subcutaneously in the ﬂank
of nude mice (11). Tumor growth was measured with a Vernier

www.aacrjournals.org

caliper, and weight (mg ¼ mm3) calculated as follows: [length
(mm)  width2 (mm2)]/2.
Intraperitoneal models. Ascites was centrifuged, washed
repeatedly, resuspended in HBSS, and implanted intraperitoneally in nude mice at a dose of 10 to 20  106 cells. Criteria for
growing tumors were abdominal distension and palpable
tumor masses in the peritoneal cavity (11). Mice were killed
when they presented signs of discomfort (survival), ascites was
harvested, and the volume recorded.
Intrabursal transplantation. Ovarian cancer cells from
solid tumor enzymatic digestion or ascites (1  106 cell suspension) were injected orthotopically under the bursa (i.b.)
of the mouse ovary, as previously reported (21) and detailed
in Supplementary Data. At necropsy, the ovary image was
acquired with a macrodigital imaging system (MacroPATH;
Milestone S.r.l); the two diameters were determined, the mean
calculated and taken as measure of tumor mass. Ascites was
harvested and the volume recorded.
For mice transplanted intraperitoneally or intrabursally, a
complete necropsy was done on each mouse by two independent scientists. Tumor dissemination in representative organs
of the peritoneal cavity (liver, diaphragm, omentum, pancreas,
uterus/ovary, and enlarged lymph nodes) was rated using an
arbitrary score for gross tumor dissemination: 0 ¼ not inﬁltrated; 1 ¼ small masses; 2 ¼ evident masses; 3 ¼ completely
invaded, as previously described (22).
EOC xenograft samples were snap frozen for genomic
analysis, ﬁxed in 10% formalin and embedded in parafﬁn
(FFPE), or frozen in optimal cutting compound (OCT) for
histologic and IHC analysis. Established EOC xenografts were
transplanted serially in nude mice for further studies (i.e.,
therapy) and cryopreserved frozen in DMSO at different
passages.
Hystopathological analysis
The morphology of patient's tumor tissues was compared
with their corresponding xenografts using parafﬁn-embedded
sections and standard protocols (23), as detailed in Supplementary Data.
Molecular analysis
Mutational analysis. ARID1A (exons 1 to 20), BRAF (exons
11 and 15), CTNNB1 (exon 3), KRAS (exon 2), PI3KCA (exons 10
and 21), PPP2R1A (exons 5 and 6), and TP53 (exons 5 to 9) were
sequenced to assess their mutational status. Genomic DNA
was obtained from EOC xenografts (N ¼ 34) and patient
tumors (N ¼ 23) and analyzed as described in Supplementary
Data and Supplementary Table S1.
Gene copy number. The c-Met, c-Myc, PI3Ka, PTEN,
FGFR1, ERBB2, RB1, and NF1 gene copy number was assessed
using the TaqMan Copy Number Assay (Applied Biosystems)
using the ABI 7900, Applied Biosystems. RNAse P copy number
was used as reference gene.
Genome-wide gene expression. EOC xenografts collected
from subcutis, abdominal masses, and ascites of mice
engrafted with tumors at different passages (from 1 up to
13) and from patient specimens, underwent one-color microarray-based gene expression proﬁling. To assess the amount of

29 EOC xenograft models) was done with Bioconductor (24),
using R statistical language, with MeV version 4.8 (25) and the
functional annotation tool available in the DAVID bioinformatic resource (26), as detailed in Supplementary Data.
Microarray data are MIAME compliant and have been
deposited into the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnical
Information) database Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession no.GSE56920).
Drugs and treatments
Paclitaxel (PTX, Indena S.p.A.) was dissolved in 50% CremophorEL (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% ethanol and further diluted with saline before use. Cisplatin (CDDP, Sigma-Aldrich) was
dissolved in 0.9% NaCl. They were administered at their
optimal dose and schedule as detailed in the Results.
For subcutaneous tumors, mice were randomized to treatment at approximately 150 mg of tumor weight (8–10 mice
per group). Treatment efﬁcacy was expressed as best tumor
growth inhibition [%T/C ¼ (median weight of treated
tumors/median weight of control tumors)  100]. Animals
were euthanized when primary tumor volume exceeded 15%
of body weight.
For intraperitoneal tumors, mice (8 to 10 per group) were
randomized to treatment at an advanced stage (i.e., 25% of
expected median survival time, MST), regularly monitored, and
killed at the ﬁrst signs of discomfort (the day of death being
considered the limit of survival). The increment of life span
(ILS) was calculated as [(median survival day of treated
group  median survival day of control group)/median survival day of control group]  100.
Drug activity was interpreted as follows: subcutaneous
tumors were considered resistant with T/C 50%, responsive
with 10%<T/C<50%, and very responsive with T/C10%;
intraperitoneal tumors were considered resistant with
ILS40%, responsive with 40%<ILS<100%, and very responsive
with ILS  100%, according to published criteria (27, 28).

Results
Generation of EOC xenografts from patients with ovarian
cancer
We collected 138 tumor samples from patients with ovarian
cancer and xenotrasplanted them in nude mice; 34 EOC
xenografts could be established (25% tumor take) and successfully maintained through multiple rounds of serial transplantation. Approximately another 10% of the specimens
engrafted in the mice receded and could not be transplanted
further. Twenty-two EOC xenografts were established subcutaneously and twelve were obtained by transplanting ascites
into the peritoneal cavity of the mice (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Table
1 and Supplementary Table S2 summarize the clinicopathological data of patients' tumors from which the EOC xenografts
were derived. Seventeen EOC xenografts came from chemotherapy-na€ve tumors, 17 from patients treated with a chemotherapy, two of them (MNHOC18 and MNHOC164) derived
from patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment. Tumor
grade and tumor stage did not seem to predict engraftment in
nude mice (Supplementary Table S3A); when only the serous

www.aacrjournals.org

histotype was considered, a correlation between residual
tumor and tumor engraftment was found (P ¼ 0.024; Supplementary Table S3B).
Figure 1 depicts the biologic behavior of the EOC xenografts
established in nude mice as s.c (Fig. 1A) or ascites (Fig. 1B–D).
The growth rate of the EOC xenografts differed as suggested by
the time to reach 1 g (1–15 months for subcutaneously
transplanted xenografts; Fig. 1A), by the MST (1–4 months
for intraperitoneally transplanted xenografts; Fig. 1B), and by
the production of ascites and the level of tumor dissemination
in the organs of the peritoneal cavity of the mice (Fig. 1C
and D).
Morphologic and pathologic similarity of EOC
xenografts to the original patient's tumor
To rule out any phenotypic drift that xenografted tumors
might have acquired, the histology of tumors grown in mice
was compared with the corresponding original patient tumor.
In all the cases, the morphology and tissue architecture were
similarly preserved (14 representative matched cases are
reported in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
The established xenografts (N ¼ 34) were histologically
similar to the patient tumors from which they were derived
and 16 were classiﬁed as serous, three as mixed serous-endometrioid, ﬁve as endometrioid, one as mixed endometrioidclear cell, two as clear cell, two as mucinous, two as mixed
Mullerian tumors (carcinosarcoma), two as undifferentiated,
and one as nonclassiﬁed.
All tumorgrafts retained positivity for a number of antibodies generally used for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer,
including cytokeratin pool and CA-125 (Supplementary Fig.
S2). After multiple passages in mice, the positivity for some
markers decreased, but the tissue architecture of the tumor of
origin was maintained (Supplementary Fig. S3).
EOC xenografts reproduce the dissemination pattern of
human ovarian cancer
Ovarian carcinoma spreads into the peritoneal cavity with
a clinical feature of disseminated carcinomatosis. The ability
to recapitulate the dissemination pattern of human EOC was
investigated in a subset of EOC xenografts transplanted in
the bursa of the mouse ovary (Fig. 1E–G). The growth rate in
the ovary seemed not to be inﬂuenced by the histotype (Fig.
1E). A diffuse tumor dissemination in the peritoneal cavity
similar to that of the EOC xenograft engrafted intraperitoneally and involving liver, pancreas, ovary-uterus (controlateral), lymph nodes, diaphragm, and omentum was
observed (Fig. 1F and G). The growth rate in the bursa and
their dissemination were not necessarily associated, with
MNHOC10, MNHOC107, and MNHOC78 showing the greatest dissemination potential. Ascites did not always form,
despite the ability of ovarian cancer cells to disseminate
through the peritoneal cavity (11/17 EOC xenografts transplanted intrabursally formed ascites; Fig. 1F). The ability to
form abdominal effusion seemed to depend on the primary
tumor source, not on the route of implantation, as almost all
the xenografts from patients' ascites gave rise to ascites in
mice (except MNHOC8 and MNHOC84 when transplanted

not.
EOC xenografts retain the molecular features of human
ovarian cancer
Molecular characterization was undertaken in the original
patient tumor and corresponding xenograft. We investigated
the mutational status of genes involved in the pathogenesis of
ovarian carcinoma. The detailed mutational spectrum is sum-

marized in Supplementary Table S4. Nonsynonymous TP53
mutations were found in 76% of the EOC xenografts. Interestingly, clear cell, mucinous, and low-grade serous/endometrioid
carcinomas harbored wt TP53, whereas the majority of highgrade serous carcinoma harbored a mutated TP53, in line with
clinical data (29). No mutations were found in ARID1A, BRAF,
CTNNB1, and PPP2R1A genes. MNHOC142 xenograft harbored
a mutation in the catalytic subunit of PI3Ka and MNHOC84
xenograft and its corresponding patient tumor had a mutation
affecting KRAS (G12A). The EOC xenografts and the corresponding patient tumors whose DNAs were available generally
displayed the same mutational status (18/23 ¼ 78%). Exceptions were one case showing a different TP53 missense mutation and four were the mutations that could not be detected in
the patient tumor (Supplementary Table S4).
We then checked the copy number of different genes (cMet,
cMyc, PI3Ka, PTEN, FGFR1, ERBB2, NF1, and RB1). Despite a
similar gene copy number distribution (Supplementary Table
S5), EOC xenografts tended to harbor higher gene copy numbers
than patient tumors, suggesting greater tumor genomic instability upon in vivo selection; matching patient tumor and
xenograft gene copy number is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.
We carried out genome-wide gene expression analysis of
EOC xenografts and patient tumors to evaluate their transcriptomic proﬁling. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
revealed a high correlation of global gene expression among
the EOC regardless of their origin (patient or xenograft); EOC
clustered far apart from other cancer types, tumor xenografts,
and cell lines of different origin (Fig. 3A), obtained from public
repositories and hybridized on the same Agilent platform. The
high degree of similarity between EOC xenografts and patient
tumors was conﬁrmed by the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
ranging from 0.84 to 0.99 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Two-class
paired comparison between patient tumors and their paired
EOC xenografts (9 cases) revealed 1,042 differentially expressed
transcripts with log fold change greater than 1 or lower than 1
(P value <0.01). Interestingly, the main biologic processes
represented in this dataset belonged to the immune response
(Supplementary Table S6). Clustering based on these transcripts (Fig. 3B) showed a clear distinction between the patient
tumors and the EOC xenografts, with most genes being downregulated in the latter. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of
the EOC xenografts (based on the expression of all probes; Fig.
4) revealed a high reproducibility of global gene expression
proﬁles among xenografts harvested from different in vivo
passages or different site of implantation (i.e., subcutis or
orthotopic-abdominal masses and ascitic effusion) of the
same patient lesion. Interestingly, 85% (17 out of 20) of the
high-grade/high-stage serous and endometrioid carcinomas
EOC models clustered together, likewise the majority of clear
cells, mucinous, low-grade/low-stage serous, and endometrioid ovarian cancer xenografts (83%; 5 out of 6; Fig. 4).

EOC xenografts and response to platinum-based therapy
EOC xenografts were pharmacologically characterized for
their response to CDDP and PTX at optimal dose schedules.
CDDP antitumor activity was evaluated, not carboplatin, as
previous data from our laboratory have shown similar antitumor activity of the two drugs in xenograft models. A heatmap
representation of EOC xenograft response to therapy is
reported in Table 2. The spectrum of response to both drugs
was wide, ranging from very good activity, in which tumor
regressions could be observed, to no activity. The patient's
response to a platinum-based therapy for 11 cases could be
compared with the response of the corresponding xenograft
(Table 3). Only two cases showed a completely different
response to a platinum-based therapy: the MNHOC124 xenograft was very responsive, while the patient's clinical response
was stable disease, and the MNHOC119 xenograft was resistant
to CDDP, while the patient achieved a complete response. In all
the other cases, activity was similar with three cases that
completely matched in patient and the corresponding xenograft (MNHOC8Y, MNHOC10, and MNHOC230).

Discussion
Collections of patient-derived tumor xenografts have been
established for different tumor types (for review see ref. 19),
including breast (30, 31), colorectal (32, 33), lung (34), pancreatic cancers (35, 36), and glioblastoma (37, 38). While we were
preparing this manuscript, two papers were published on
tumor grafts obtained from ovarian tumors, one focusing on
a small series of high-grade serous type (13), whereas the other
presenting a large tumor bank of ovarian cancer of different
histotype (14).
The present work shows that (i) our panel of 34 EOC
xenografts comprises all the main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma; (ii) the EOC xenografts in general maintain the key
features of the original tumor, including histopathology, gene
copy number, and mutational spectrum; (iii) the EOC xenografts reproduce the dissemination into the peritoneal cavity of
mice typical of ovarian carcinoma; (iv) comprehensive
genome-wide gene expression analysis conﬁrms high-degree
of similarity among the xenografts and between the xenografts and patient EOCs, and distinguishes different subsets of

EOC xenografts; (v) our EOC xenograft panel consists of tumors
with different sensitivity to chemotherapy from very responsive, responsive, to resistant tumors, well reproducing the
response to therapy in ovarian patients.
The EOC xenografts were obtained by transplanting subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in nude mice tumor samples
freshly obtained after cytoreductive surgery for abdominal
masses or paracentesis of ascites. In these experimental conditions, we obtained 25% xenografts, regardless of the transplantation route, a tumor take in line with earlier studies
establishing patient-derived EOC xenografts in athymic nude
mice (11, 39, 40). A better take could probably be obtained
by transplanting ovarian tumors in more immunodeﬁcient
mice (SCID and NOD-SCID-IL2gR,) as recently reported
(13, 14). Interestingly, we found the engraftment being correlated with residual tumor in high-serous ovarian carcinomas,
further supporting residual tumor as a poor prognostic factor
in this disease.
The EOC xenografts showed consistency with the tumors
they derived from, on the histopathological and molecular
levels. The histotype and tissue architecture were fairly well
maintained and, importantly, the xeno-panel reproduced the
plethora of human ovarian carcinomas with all the different
histotypes: serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, carcinosarcoma, and undifferentiated, similarly to what was recently reported by Weroha and colleagues (14).
Our genome-wide studies indicate a high degree of similarity
among the ovarian cancers that clustered together far apart
from clinical tumors of different types, xenograft models, and
cell types. The correlation coefﬁcients (0.84–0.99) conﬁrmed
the high concordance of the clinical samples with the EOC
xenografts. In similar studies, the correlation coefﬁcient

www.aacrjournals.org

between the patient tumors and their matching xenografts
was above 0.88 for pancreatic cancers (41), from 0.78 to 0.95 for
NSCLC (42), and lower for melanomas (43). The genes differentially expressed in the patient's tumors and the xenografts
belong to the human immune system and were mainly downregulated in the xenografts. This is in accordance with previous
reports (41, 42) and suggests a loss of human-inﬁltrating
immune cells and a tumor stroma of murine origin. Although
gene expression analysis on EOC xenografts and primary
patient tumor was available for only nine cases, our ﬁndings
are in agreement with previous studies showing molecular
ﬁdelity of tumor xenograft to its primary patient tumor
(14, 30, 31). The overall gene expression proﬁle of the individual
EOC xenografts was conserved upon passaging and was not
altered in relation to the site of tumor growth, so it appears that
the process of engraftment and expansion does not largely
change the molecular features of the cancer.
The general preservation of most of the patient tumor
mutations in the EOC xenografts suggests that they are a valid
model for functional and therapeutic studies. However, the
altered mutations and higher gene copy number in four of the
34 xenografts call for caution in interpreting the results in those
models. An enriched pattern of mutations in xenografts compared with primary tumors has been described (44, 45), and can
be explained by the xenotransplantation selecting cells with a
distinct subset of the primary tumor mutation repertoire or,
alternatively, by tumor genomic progression during xenograft
establishment.
The majority of our EOC xenografts derived from stage III/IV
and grade 3 ovarian tumors and diffuse dissemination into the
peritoneal cavity was observed when transplanting EOC xenografts intraperitoneally and intrabursally, with tumor masses

growing and invading the visceral organs. In some cases, this
was accompanied with the production of ascites. Our preclinical models mirror the clinical setting, where one third of
women with ovarian cancer develop ascites during the course
of their disease (46) and this seems not to be related to any
speciﬁc histologic subtype.
The response to therapy is instrumental to validate the
clinical predictive value of patient-derived xenografts. In 11
cases, we could compare the xenograft response with the
clinical response to a CDDP-based therapy: it was completely
different in two cases, while comparable in the remaining.
More than in other tumors, ovarian cancer patient's outcome
depends on other factors, such as the disease dissemination
and residual tumor (RT) after surgery (47). Our xeno-trials were
clearly not inﬂuenced by these factors as most of them were
done in very different experimental conditions (i.e., "neoadjuvant like" setting with a limited tumor burden). For example,
the MNHOC124 xenograft responded very well; in contrast
patient MNHOC124, albeit achieving stable disease (SD) after
adjuvant therapy, had a RT >10 mm that probably inﬂuenced
her prognosis, as her overall survival was 9 months. Another
case is MNHOC119, a clear cell carcinoma with a RT ¼ NED
(nonevidence of disease) that likely determined the patient's
good response; however a poor prognosis with low response
to chemotherapy has been reported in advanced ovarian clear
cell carcinomas (4), as in our corresponding xenograft. Response to platinum in ovarian cancer xenografts (eight cases)
correlated well with patient's clinical response in Weroha and
colleagues study (14) and concordance was also reported by
Topp and colleagues in their series of 12 high-grade serous
ovarian patient-derived xenografts (13). Our panel of EOC
xenografts fulﬁlls all the different responses to platinum-based
therapy observed in the clinic and this strengthens the possibility of this EOC xeno-bank being instrumental in understanding the mechanism of the resistance to CDDP and in
testing novel therapeutic strategies to overcome it.
A dualistic model of ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis has
been proposed that classiﬁes them as type I and type II. Type I
EOCs are low-grade, relatively indolent, and genetically stable;
type II tumors include high-grade serous carcinoma, which is
a highly aggressive cancer, genetically unstable, and frequently
mutated in TP53 (7). The EOC xenografts we established are of
different histologic types and span from grade 1 to 3; the
integration of the clinical and preclinical data would allow to
classify these xenografts as type I and type II on the basis of
their pathologic and molecular characteristics (Fig. 4). This
classiﬁcation might help to a better understanding of ovarian
cancers and enable us to tackle speciﬁc questions such as
tailored therapy of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma or
isolation of tumor-initiating cells from type I and type II
tumors (23).
The data reported reinforce the idea that EOC patientderived xenografts largely retain the phenotypic and genomic characteristics of their original tumor. Our preclinical
platform, along with the other two series of patient-derived
ovarian cancer xenografts recently obtained (13, 14), offers
an instructive framework for molecular target discovery/
validation studies, for the identiﬁcation of biomarker of
