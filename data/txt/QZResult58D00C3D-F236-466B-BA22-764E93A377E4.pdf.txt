Abstract

Author Manuscript

Colitis-associated colorectal cancers are an etiologically distinct subgroup of colon cancers that
occur in individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease and arise as a consequence of
persistent exposure of hyperproliferative epithelial stem cells to an inflammatory
microenvironment. An intrinsic defect in the intestinal epithelial barrier has been proposed to be
one of several factors that contribute to the inappropriate immune response to the commensal
microbiota that underlies inflammatory bowel disease. Matriptase is a membrane-anchored serine
protease encoded by Suppression of Tumorigenicity-14 (ST14) that strengthens the intestinal
epithelial barrier by promoting tight junction formation. Here we show that intestinal epithelialspecific ablation of St14 in mice causes formation of colon adenocarcinoma with very early onset
and high penetrance. Neoplastic progression is preceded by a chronic inflammation of the colon
that resembles human inflammatory bowel disease and is promoted by the commensal microbiota.
This study demonstrates that inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis can be initiated and
promoted solely by an intrinsic intestinal permeability barrier perturbation, establishes St14 as a
critical tumor suppressor gene in the mouse gastrointestinal tract, and adds matriptase to the
expanding list of pericellular proteases with tumor suppressive functions.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Colitis-associated colorectal cancers are etiologically and molecularly distinct from familial
adenomatous polyposis coli-associated colorectal cancer, hereditary non-polyposis coli
colorectal cancer, and sporadic colorectal cancer. The malignancy occurs in individuals
suffering from ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease (collectively, inflammatory bowel
disease) with an incidence that is proportional to duration of the disease. The neoplastic
progression of disease-striken colonic epithelium is believed to be driven by the chronic
inflammatory microenvironment, which promotes the progressive genomic instability of

While there is considerable debate about the relative importance of the specific factors that
contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease, there is a consensus that the
disease represents an inappropriate immune response to the commensal microbiota in
genetically predisposed individuals (reviewed in (Kaser et al., 2010, Saleh and Trinchieri,
2011, Schreiber et al., 2005, Van Limbergen et al., 2009, Xavier and Podolsky, 2007)). In
this regard, the contribution of aberrant inflammatory circuits to the development of
inflammatory bowel disease has been clearly established by genetic analysis, including
genome-wide association studies, that have linked loss of function mutations or
polymorphisms in genes encoding interleukins, interleukin receptors, chemokine receptors,
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, toll-like receptor 4,
intelectins, and prostaglandin receptors to ulcerative colitis, to Crohn’s disease or to both.
Further support for a principal role of derailed inflammatory circuits is gained from the
spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease observed in mice deficient in a variety of immune
effectors (reviewed in (Kaser et al., 2010, Saleh and Trinchieri, 2011, Schreiber et al., 2005,
Van Limbergen et al., 2009, Xavier and Podolsky, 2007)). Much less explored is the
importance of individual components of the intestinal epithelial barrier in preventing
inflammatory bowel disease, and the potential contribution of intrinsic intestinal epithelial
barrier defects to the development of the syndrome. The clearest indication of the potential
importance of primary barrier integrity comes from studies of mice with germline ablation
of Muc2 encoding the major mucin that shields the intestinal epithelium from direct contact
with the microbiota. These mice develop colitis, which may progress to colon
adenocarcinomas in older animals (Velcich et al., 2002). Additional evidence has been
obtained from transgenic mice with intestinal epithelial-specific overexpression of myosin
light chain kinase, which display decreased barrier function and increased immune
activation, although an inflammatory bowel-like syndrome did not emerge in the absence of
additional immunological challenges (Su et al., 2009).

Matriptase is a member of the recently established family of type II transmembrane serine
proteases that is encoded by the Suppression of Tumorigenicity-14 (ST14) gene (Bugge et
al., 2009, Kim et al., 1999, Lin et al., 1999, Takeuchi et al., 1999, Tanimoto et al., 2001).
ST14 was originally proposed to be a colon cancer tumor suppressor gene, due to its specific
down-regulation in adenocarcinomas of the colon (Zhang et al., 1998). Matriptase is
expressed in multiple epithelia of the integumental, gastrointestinal, and urogenital systems,
where it has pleiotropic functions in the differentiation or homeostasis of both simple and
stratified epithelia, at least in part through the proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium
channel activator, prostasin/PRSS8 (Szabo and Bugge, 2011). In simple epithelium of the
gastrointestinal tract, a principal function of matriptase is to promote the formation of a
paracellular permeability barrier, possibly through the posttranslational regulation of the
composition of claudins that are incorporated into the epithelial tight junction complex of
differentiating intestinal epithelial cells (Buzza et al., 2010, List et al., 2009).

Through lineage-specific loss of function analysis in mice we now have examined the role
of St14 as a tumor suppressor gene. Interestingly, we found that the selective ablation of
St14 from intestinal epithelium results in the formation of adenocarcinoma of the colon with
very early onset and high penetrance. Neoplastic progression occurs in the absence of
exposure of animals to carcinogens or tumor promoting agents, is preceded by chronic
colonic inflammation that resembles human inflammatory bowel disease, and can be
suppressed by aggressive antibiotics treatment. The study demonstrates that inflammationassociated colon carcinogenesis can be initiated solely by intrinsic paracellular permeability
barrier perturbations, and establishes that St14 is a critical tumor suppressor gene in the
mouse gastrointestinal tract.

Meta-analysis of transcriptomes shows decreased expression of ST14 in human colon
adenomas and adenocarcinomas

Author Manuscript

We first performed in silico data mining of the Oncomine microarray database (Rhodes et
al., 2004) to corroborate the initial report of reduced ST14 expression in human colon cancer
(Zhang et al., 1998) (Figure 1). Interestingly, ST14 was significantly downregulated
compared to normal colon in seven of the fourteen published studies listed in the database
(studies A and C–H), whereas six studies showed no change (studies B and J–N) and a
single study (study I) found ST14 to be upregulated (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
Of the fourteen studies, study A, which compared gene expression in colorectal dysplastic
adenomatous polyps to normal colonic epithelium, was conducted using laser capture
microdissected tissue (ST14 downregulation, P < 0.0006) (Gaspar et al., 2008), and therefore
provided the most reliable estimate of ST14 expression in normal and dysplastic colonic
epithelium.
St14-ablated colonic epithelium undergoes rapid and spontaneous malignant
transformation

Author Manuscript

To specifically explore the functional consequences of intestinal loss of St14 on colon
carcinogenesis, we interbred mice carrying an St14LoxP allele (List et al., 2009) with mice
carrying an St14 null allele (St14−) and mice carrying a Cre transgene under the control of
the intestinal-specific villin promoter (villin-Cre+) (Madison et al., 2002). This resulted in
the generation of villin-Cre+/0;St14LoxP/− mice (hereafter termed St14− mice) and their
associated littermates villin-Cre+/0;St14LoxP/+, villin-Cre0;St14LoxP/−, and villinCre0;St14LoxP/+ (hereafter termed St14+ mice). As reported recently (List et al., 2009), this
strategy resulted in the efficient deletion of matriptase from the entire intestinal tract, as
shown by the loss of matriptase immunoreactivity in colon (compare Supplementary Figure
1a and b) and small intestine (compare Supplementary Figure 1c and d), and by highly
diminished St14 transcript abundance (Supplementary Figure 1e). St14− mice were
outwardly unremarkable at birth, but displayed significant growth retardation after weaning
(Supplementary Figure 1f). Examination of prospective cohorts of St14− mice and their
associated littermate controls revealed that intestinal St14 ablation greatly diminished life
span (Supplementary Figure 1g).

Unexpectedly, histological analysis of moribund St14− mice revealed the presence of
invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon in 8 of 24 (33%) of St14− mice examined at four to 18
weeks of age (Table 1, Figure 2a, b, and d) and dysplastic colonic epithelium (regenerative
atypia) in the remaining 16 mice (Table 1 and Figure 2d). Remarkably, in light of the fact
that these mice were not carcinogen treated or exposed to other insults to the intestinal tract,
adenocarcinoma could be found in mice less than five weeks of age (Table 1). All
adenocarcinomas had progressed to invade the muscularis mucosae underlying the colonic
epithelium and the subadjacent muscularis externa (Figure 2a and b). Furthermore, in six of
eight (75%) adenocarcinomas examined, the tumor cells had infiltrated the lymphatic
vasculature, as revealed by combined immunohistochemical staining with pan-keratin
antibodies and antibodies against the lymphatic endothelial marker, LYVE-1 (Table 1 and
Figure 2c and d). The tumors displayed many hallmarks of human colitis-associated colon
cancer, including activation of β-catenin (Figure 3a and a′), dysorganized basement
membrane deposition (Figure 3b and b′), fibrosis (Figure 3c and c′), severe dysplasia with
abundant atypical mitosis (Figure 3d), epithelial hyperproliferation (Figure 4a and a′), loss
of terminal differentiation (Figure 4b and b′), and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates
(Figure 4c and c′, d and d′). Importantly, the small intestine was histologically unremarkable
in all mice examined (data not shown), although St14 was efficiently ablated also from this
tissue (Supplementary Figure 1d and e). Taken together, these data show that St14 is a
critical tissue-specific tumor suppressor gene in the mouse intestine that suppresses the
formation of early, invasive adenocarcinomas of the colon.
Impaired barrier function in St14-ablated colon

Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that either reduced matriptase expression or global postnatal
ablation of matriptase from all tissues results in impaired intestinal barrier function (Buzza
et al., 2010, List et al., 2009), suggesting that this would also be a feature of mice with
intestinal epithelial-specific embryonic deletion of matriptase. To examine colonic and small
intestinal barrier function, we injected a reactive biotin tracer into the intestinal lumen of
three week old St14− and littermate St14+ mice and followed the fate of the marker using
fluorescent streptavidin. Compatible with an intact intestinal barrier function, the biotin
marker decorated the surface of colonic crypts and villi of the small intestine, but did not
penetrate into the tissue of St14+ mice (Figure 5a and d). In contrast, just three minutes after
intraluminal biotin injection, the biotin tracer could be found on the basolateral membranes
and on connective tissue cells of the colon and small intestine of St14− mice demonstrating a
profound failure to establish a functional intestinal barrier (Figure 5b and e).

Neoplastic progression occurs within a chronic inflammatory colonic microenvironment
that resembles inflammatory bowel disease
St14-ablated colonic tissue was histologically unremarkable when examined at birth and at
postnatal day five (compare Figures 6a and a′, b and b′). The first observable pathological
manifestation (day 10) was the detachment and apoptosis (anoikis) of distal crypt cells
(compare Figure 6c and c′). This was followed by the failure of colonic epithelial cells to
undergo proper terminal differentiation, as evidenced by cessation of mucin formation (data
not shown). Thereafter, St14− colons entered a progressively hyperplastic inflammatory and
ulcerative state that eventually resulted in the gross distortion of colonic tissue architecture

(compare Figure 6d and d′, and 6e and e′). BrdU incorporating cells initially were confined
to the bottom of the crypts, but later were present also in distal segments of the crypts (data
not shown). Inflammatory infiltrates were evident at day 15. Inflammation at first was mild,
but rapidly became severe, with inflammatory cells eventually constituting the dominant cell
population of the mucosa and submucosa. Polyps were not observed in any of the examined
colons prior to malignant transformation, indicating that St14 ablation-associated
adenocarcinomas, like inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancers arise from
flat lesions within hyperproliferative and inflamed mucosa.

To elucidate the molecular events that precede the early development of colitis in mice with
matriptase-ablated colonic epithelium, we next performed stage-specific transcriptomic
analysis using whole-genome arrays. We selected two time points (days 0 and 5) where
matriptase-ablated colonic epithelium was histologically normal, and one time point (day
10) where pathological changes were emerging (see above). The analysis was repeated four
times for each of the three time points by analyzing individual St14−mice and their
associated St14+ littermates. Genes that were more than two-fold up or downregulated in
each of the four separate experiments were considered for analysis. No significant
differences in the transcriptomes of St14-ablated and St14-sufficient colons were apparent at
day 0 (data not shown). Interestingly, however, dysregulation of epithelial differentiation
was apparent already at day 5 and was pronounced at day 10 (Tables 2 and 3). This was
evidenced by the conspicuous upregulation of genes typically expressed in basal, suprabasal
or keratinizing layers of stratified squamous epithelium lining the oral cavity, interfollicular
epidermis, hair and nails of follicular epidermis, and filiform papillae of the tongue. These
included keratin 14 (Krt14), keratin 36 (Krt36), keratin 84 (Krt84), small protein-rich
protein 1a (Sprr1a), small protein-rich protein 2h (Sprr2h), and secreted Ly6/Plaur domain
containing 1 (Slurp1). Abnormal colonic epithelial differentiation at day five was further
evidenced by the downregulation of the expression of Paneth cell-specific alpha-defensin 4
(Defa4). Although St14− colonic tissues were histologically normal at day 5, activation of
inflammatory pathways was evidenced by the increased expression of several inflammationassociated genes, including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1 (Cxcl1), matrix
metalloproteinase 10 (Mmp10), lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C2 (Ly6c2), tumor
necrosis factor (Tnf), myelin and lymphocyte protein (Mal), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3),
lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus I (Ly6i), lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus D
(Ly6d), and GPI-anchored molecule-like protein (Gml). Inflammatory circuit activation was
manifest at day 10, with upregulated expression of a number of additional inflammationassociated genes, including receptor-interacting serine-threonin kinase 3 (Ripk3),
lipopolysaccharide binding protein (Lbp), lactotransferrin (Ltf), TNFAIP3 interacting protein
3 (Tnip3), secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (Slpi), leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1
(Lrg1), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5 (Cxcl5). Several epithelial proliferationassociated genes also were upregulated at day 10, including genes encoding the growth
factors amphiregulin (Areg), heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (Hbegf), and the p53binding proliferation inducer, tripartite-motif containing-29 (Trim29). Taken together, the

combined stage-specific histological and transcriptomic analysis show that colonic epithelial
ablation of matriptase causes aberrant early postnatal epithelial differentiation that triggers
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, which in turn causes persistent inflammation and
chronic epithelial hyperproliferation.

Colonic tumor initiation in humans and animal models frequently is linked to dysregulated
BMP, Notch, and Wnt signaling, leading to the expansion of the colonic stem cell
population (de Lau et al., 2007, Hardwick et al., 2008, Medema and Vermeulen, 2011, Zeki
et al., 2011). We therefore examined the level of expression of several putative and
validated colonic stem cell markers (Aldh1a1, Ascl2, Ets2, Lgr5, Phlda1), as well as BMP
(Cbfb, Dlx2, Hes1, Id1, Id2, Id3, Id4, Junb, Sox4, Stat1), Notch (Cdkn1a, Ccdn1, Cdk2,
Hes1, Hes6, Klf4, Myc, Nfkb2), and Wnt (Ascl2, Axin2, Cd44, Csnk1a1, Csnk1d, Csnk1e,
Ctnnb1, Cryl1, Ephb2, Ephb3, Gfi1, Hdac2, Id3, Ihh, Lef1, Myc, Nkd1, Nlk, Pascin2, Pcna,
Plat, Rbbp4, Snai1, Sox4, Sox9, Spdef, Stra6, Tcf4, Yes1) target genes in St14− mice and
their associated St14+ littermates (Supplementary Table 2). This transcriptomic analysis
provided no clear evidence of stem cell expansion or dysregulation of either of the three
signaling pathways at day 0, at day 5, when abnormal differentiation and innate immune
activation were apparent, or even at day 10, when abnormal colonic morphology was
manifest. In agreement with this analysis, expression of the Wnt target, Sox9, in St14− mice
was appropriately confined to the crypts at day 10, and aberrant localization of Sox9 was not
detected until day 15 (Supplementary Figure 2).
Diminution of the intestinal microbiota retards development of inflammatory bowel
disease-like colitis

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that the chronic inflammatory microenvironment that facilitated neoplastic
progression of St14-ablated colonic epithelium was generated in part by increased exposure
of the mucosal immune system to the resident microbiota due to impaired barrier formation
and aberrant differentiation. To challenge this hypothesis, we next treated weaning-age
St14− mice with a cocktail of the four antibiotics, ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and
vancomycin or with vehicle for two weeks, a standard procedure for cleansing of the
intestinal microbiota (Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004). Due to the failure of some of the four
antibiotics to be present in milk, the treatment was initiated at weaning, when significant
pre-neoplastic progression was already apparent (Figure 6e and e′). As expected, antibiotics
treatment reduced the colonic bacterial load by approximately 1,500-fold, as judged by the
abundance of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA in feces (Figure 7a), without compromising
body weight (Figure 7b). Helicobacter is found commonly in the commensal microbiota of
mice and promotes neoplastic progression in a variety of models of colon carcinogenesis
(Engle et al., 2002, Erdman et al., 2003, Hale et al., 2007, Maggio-Price et al., 2006,
Newman et al., 2001). We therefore specifically determined the presence of helicobacter
DNA in feces of antibiotics-treated and untreated St14− mice by PCR analysis
(Supplementary Table 3). Nine of 17 (53%), 7/17 (41%), and 1/17 (6%) of control mice
tested were positive forHelicobacter typhlonius, Helicobacter rodentium, and an
undetermined Helicobacter species, respectively, whereas 2/13 (15%) of the analyzed
antibiotics-treated mice were positive for Helicobacter typhlonius. Although initiated only
after weaning, antibiotics treatment markedly blunted abnormal epithelial differentiation,

epithelial hyperproliferation and inflammation of the colon. This was evidenced by a
quantitative reduction in colonic mucosal thickness (Figure 7c), increased mucin production
(Figure 7d, Figure 8a and b), decreased epithelial proliferation (Figure 7e, Figure 8c and d),
and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 7f–h, Figure 8e–j), although the
diminution of T-cell and neutrophil abundance did not reach statistical significance.
Furthermore, β-catenin expression levels were normalized in two of four antibiotics-treated
St14− mice when analyzed by immunoblot (Supplementary Figure 3A, compare lanes 7–10
with 13 and 14), and Sox9 was only infrequently found in the distal portion of the colonic
crypts of antibiotics-treated St14− mice (Supplementary Figure 2d and e), suggesting a
diminution of Wnt signaling. Analysis of BMP (phospho-SMAD1/5) and Notch1 (Notch1
intracellular domain) signaling did not reveal a treatment- or genotype-specific pattern, but
the abundance of each of the two protein species in intestinal tissue extracts was difficult to
assess accurately (Supplementary Figure 3B).

Author Manuscript

Taken together, the data are compatible with a principal role of the commensal microbiota in
pre-neoplastic progression. A mechanistic model for matriptase ablation-induced colon
cancer based on the above findings is shown in Figure 9. We propose that the intrinsic defect
in barrier function associated with the failure to form functional tight junctions (Buzza et al.,
2010, List et al., 2009) causes increased exposure of the immune system to the commensal
microbiota. This exposure elicits vigorous inflammatory and repair responses that involve
epithelial stem cell activation and are continuous, rather than transient, due to the inherent
failure of matriptase-ablated colonic epithelial cells to establish a functional barrier. The
sustained hyperproliferation of epithelial stem cells within a genotoxic chronic inflammatory
microenvironment in turn induces the progressive genomic instability and subsequent rapid
malignant conversion.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

It has long been suspected that intrinsic alterations in the paracellular intestinal permeability
barrier in humans could be a priming factor for the development of the aberrant immune
response to the commensal microbiota that underlies inflammatory bowel disease and its
associated malignancies. The current study now provides strong experimental support for
this notion by showing that intestinal epithelial-specific ablation of matriptase - a
membrane-anchored serine protease that is essential for intestinal epithelial tight junction
formation - causes a commensal microbiota-dependent inflammatory bowel disease-like
colitis that very rapidly progresses to adenocarcinoma. The spontaneous and rapid malignant
transformation of the colonic epithelium furthermore demonstrates that a simple increase in
intestinal paracellular permeability suffices to both initiate and drive inflammationassociated adenocarcinoma formation. This finding parallels the recent identification of the
permeability of the epidermal barrier as a major determinant of the development of other
chronic inflammatory diseases, including ichthyosis vulgaris, atopic eczema, and asthma
(Sandilands et al., 2009, Smith et al., 2006). Previously published animal models of
inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer include dextran sodium sulphateor dextran sodium sulphate combined with azoxymethane-induced chemical colon
carcinogenesis in inbred mouse strains (Okayasu et al., 1996, Okayasu et al., 2002), and
genetic models, including germline Il10- (Berg et al., 1996), combined germline Tbx21- and

Rag2- (Garrett et al., 2009), myeloid lineage Stat3- (Deng et al., 2010), myeloid lineage
Itgav- (Lacy-Hulbert et al., 2007), germline Gnai2- (Rudolph et al., 1995), and combined
germline Il2- and b2m-ablated mice (Shah et al., 1998). In these models, colitis and colon
carcinoma occur as a consequence of either a sustained chemical damage to the colonic
epithelium or perturbation of the immune system through elimination of key effectors of
innate or adaptive immunity. Compared to the above models, colon carcinogenesis in
intestinal St14-ablated mice appears to display some unique features. First, it is initiated by a
loss of intestinal barrier function, which is associated with aberrant differentiation and
immune activation, but these priming events initially occur in the absence of detectable
perturbation of common colon cancer-associated signaling pathways (Kaiser et al., 2007).
Second, adenocarcinoma with involvement of lymphoid tissues is observed even in very
young animals. This very rapid neoplastic progression may be explained, at least in part, by
the presence of various helicobacter species in the intestinal microbiota of St14− mice, as
colon carcinogenesis in several mouse models has been shown to be accelerated by or to be
dependent upon helicobacter colonization (Engle et al., 2002, Erdman et al., 2003, Hale et
al., 2007, Maggio-Price et al., 2006, Newman et al., 2001).
In light of the findings in this study, it is tempting to speculate that neoplastic progression in
previously described mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal
cancer (and perhaps colitis-associated human colorectal cancer) may be accelerated by an
immune activation-induced decrease in the intestinal paracellular permeability barrier
caused by downregulating the activity of matriptase or other molecules within a matriptasedependent proteolytic pathway that facilitates tight junction formation.

Conclusive links have been forged between increased activity of multiple members of the
complement of extracellular and pericellular proteases and the initiation and progression of a
vide variety of human malignancies (reviewed in (Andreasen et al., 2000, Borgono and
Diamandis, 2004, Kessenbrock et al., 2010, Mohamed and Sloane, 2006, Netzel-Arnett et
al., 2003)). Much less studied is the capacity of extracellular/pericellular proteases to act as
suppressors of tumorigenesis (reviewed in (Lopez-Otin and Matrisian, 2007, Lopez-Otin et
al., 2009)). Induced germline or lineage-specific gene deletion studies in mice as well as
spontaneous somatic mutation analysis of human cancers have provided direct evidence for
a tumor suppressive function of MMP3 (McCawley et al., 2004, McCawley et al., 2008),
MMP8 (Balbin et al., 2003, Palavalli et al., 2009), MMP12 (Acuff et al., 2006), and
Cathepsin L (Reinheckel et al., 2005). Furthermore, the frequent epigenetic and genetic
silencing of other extracellular and pericellular proteases in human cancers and the ability to
inhibit distinct steps of tumor progression in experimental models of cancer through
modulation of their level of expression suggest that the number of extracellular and
pericellular proteases with tumor suppressive function may be substantial (reviewed in
(Lopez-Otin and Matrisian, 2007, Lopez-Otin et al., 2009)). The current study adds
matriptase to the above list of pericellular proteases with tumor suppressive functions.
Matriptase, however, so far is unique among pericellular proteases in the sense that its
absence by itself suffices to cause malignancy, whereas tumor suppressive function of other
proteases was revealed in chemical and transplantation models of cancer.

Previous studies have shown that overexpression of matriptase can initiate carcinogenesis
and accelerate the dissemination of a variety of carcinomas in diverse model systems. This
property of matriptase is owed at least in part to its ability to autoactivate (Oberst et al.,
2003) and subsequently serve as an initiator of several intracellular signaling and proteolytic
cascades through proteolytic maturation of growth factors, protease activated receptor
activation, and protease zymogen conversion (Bhatt et al., 2007, Cheng et al., 2009, Forbs et
al., 2005, Ihara et al., 2002, Jin et al., 2006, Kilpatrick et al., 2006, Lee et al., 2000, List et
al., 2005, Netzel-Arnett et al., 2006, Owen et al., 2010, Sales et al., 2010, Suzuki et al.,
2004, Szabo et al., 2011, Takeuchi et al., 2000, Ustach et al., 2010). The dual ability of a
protease to promote carcinogenesis in some contexts, while suppressing carcinogenesis in
others, is rare, but not entirely unprecedented. A clear example is given by the tumor
promoting effect of transgenic misexpression of the stromal protease, MMP3, in the
mammary epithelial compartment, as opposed to the strong protection of mice from
chemically-induced squamous cell carcinogenesis caused by germ-line ablation of the
protease (McCawley et al., 2004, McCawley et al., 2008, Sternlicht et al., 1999, Sternlicht et
al., 2000). Additional proteases, such as MMP9, MMP11, and MMP19 may also promote or
suppress, respectively, malignant progression in a stage or tissue-dependent manner (LopezOtin and Matrisian, 2007).
In conclusion, our study has uncovered a critical role of the transmembrane serine protease
matriptase in preserving immune homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract and suppressing
the formation of colitis and colitis-associated adenocarcinoma formation. Furthermore, the
study surprisingly reveals that the simple perturbation of the epithelial permeability barrier
suffices to rapidly and efficiently induce malignant transformation of colonic epithelium.

The NIDCR Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the study. All studies
were strictly littermate controlled. St14 knock out (St14−/−) and conditional knockout
(St14LoxP/LoxP) mice have been described previously (List et al., 2002, List et al., 2009).
Villin-Cre+/0 [B6.SJL-Tg(Vil-Cre)997Gum/J] mice (Madison et al., 2002) were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All experimental animals were in a mixed
129/C57BL6/J/NIH Black Swiss/FVB/NJ background. The genotypes of all mice were
determined by PCR of ear or tail biopsy DNA. St14+ and St14LoxP alleles were detected
using the primers 5′-CAGTGCTGTTCAGCTTCCTCTT-3′ and 5′GTGGAGGTGGAGTTCTCATACG-5′. The presence of the St14 knock out allele was

detected using primers 5′-GTGGAGGTGGAGTTCTCATACG-3′ and 5′GTGCGAGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAGCG-3′. The Cre transgene was detected using
the primers 5′-GCATAACCAGTGAAACAGCATTGCTG-3 ′ and 5 ′GGACATGTTCAGGGATCGCCAGGCG-3′. For antibiotics treatment, mice were given a
combination of ampicillin (1 g/l, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), neomycin (1 g/l, SigmaAldrich), metronidazole (1 g/l, Sigma-Aldrich), and vancomycin (0.5 g/l, Sigma-Aldrich) in
the drinking water for two weeks, starting immediately after weaning (P20).
Quantitative PCR analysis

Author Manuscript

RNA was prepared from mouse organs by extraction in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), as recommended by the manufacturer. First strand cDNA synthesis was
performed using oligo (dT) primers with the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). An iCycler, gene expression analysis software, and IQ SYBR
Green Supermix (all from Bio-Rad Laboratories) were used for quantitative PCR analysis in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, using a primer complementary to sequence
of matriptase exon 1, 5′-AACCATGGGTAGCAATCGGGGC-3′, and matriptase exon 2, 5′AACTCCACACCCTCCTCAAAGC-3′ (annealing temperature 60 °C, denaturation
temperature 95 °C, 40 cycles). Matriptase expression levels were normalized to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) levels in each sample. Gapdh mRNA
was amplified with the primers 5′-GTGAAGCAGGCATCTGAGG-3′ and 5′CATCGAAGGTGGAAGAGTGG-3′ (annealing temperature 60 °C, denaturation
temperature 95 °C, 40 cycles).
Quantification of bacterial intestinal colonization

Author Manuscript

Bacterial DNA was isolated from feces using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Bacterial DNA was quantified by
qPCR analysis of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA, amplified by primers: 8FM (5′AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and Bact 5 15 R(5′TTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC-3′). An iCycler, gene expression analysis software, and IQ
SYBR Green Supermix were used for real-time PCR in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. The thermal cycling program consisted of 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 15 s.
Helicobacter testing was performed as described previously (Feng et al., 2005, Riley et al.,
1996).
Intestinal tight junction assay

Author Manuscript

Fifty ul of 10 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHSLC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) in PBS containing 1 mmol/L CaCl2 was injected into the lumen of distal colon and
jejunum of three week old St14− and St14+ littermates that were anesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic combination (ketamine [20 mg/ml], xylazine [2 mg/
ml], 50 ul/10 g). After 3 min incubation, the mice were euthanized, and the injected portion
of the intestine was excised and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered zinc formalin (Z-fix, Anatech,
Battle Creek, MI) for 3 h, processed into paraffin and sectioned. Five μm sections were
blocked for 30 min in blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS), and then

incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin Alexa Fluor 448 conjugate
(Invitrogen) (5 ug/ml) in blocking solution. Sections were washed three times with PBS and
mounted with VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired on an Axio Imager. Z1 microscope
using an AxioCam HRc/MRm digital camera (Carl Zeiss Ldt, Jena, Germany).
Histopathology
Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Tissues were fixed for 24 h in Z-fix, processed
into paraffin, cut into 5 μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For
visualization of mucin production, sections were stained with the Periodic Acid-Schiff
(PAS) kit (Sigma-Aldrich) or Alcian Blue (1% Alcian Blue in 3% acetic acid). Collagen was
detected using Masson-trichrome staining.

Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Tissue sections were prepared and antigens were retrieved by heating in epitope retrieval
buffer (0.01 M sodium citrate, pH 6.5) or Epitop Retrieval Buffer-Reduced pH (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) for matriptase IHC. The sections were blocked for 1 h in
5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), or 10% horse serum (for matriptase IHC) in
PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibody: matriptase (Sheep, Polyclonal,
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), cytokeratins (Rabbit, Polyclonal, DakoCytomation,
Carpinteria, CA), LYVE-1 (Goat, Polyclonal, R&D Systems), β-catenin (Rabbit,
Monoclonal, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), laminin (Rabbit, Polyclonal, Sigma-Aldrich),
BrdU (Rat, Monoclonal, Accurate Chemicals & Scientific, Westbury, NY), CD3 (Rabbit,
Polyclonal, DakoCytomation), κ-light chain (Rabbit, Polyclonal, DakoCytomation), Ki67
(Rabbit, Polyclonal, Novocastra, Westbury, NY), myeloperoxidase (Rabbit, Polyclonal,
DakoCytomation), and Sox9 (Rabbit, Polyclonal, Millipore, Temecula, CA). Bound
antibodies were visualized using either biotin-conjugated horse anti-goat, goat anti-rabbit,
goat anti-rat (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), rabbit anti-sheep (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL), or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (DakoCytomation)
secondary antibodies and a VECTASTAIN ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) using 3,3′diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) or Vulcan Fast Red Chromogen Kit 2 (Biocare
Medical, Concord, CA). Hematoxylin was the counterstain.
Immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

Approximately 1 cm of the distal part of large intestine was homogenized and lysed in 25
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Boiled and reduced samples were subjected to
immunoblotting using primary antibodies: anti-β-catenin (Rabbit, Monoclonal, Cell
Signaling), anti-phospho-SMAD1/5 (Rabbit, monoclonal, Cell Signaling), anti-Notch1
(Rabbit, monoclonal, Cell Signaling), and anti-GAPDH (Rabbit, polyclonal, Santa Cruz,
Santa Cruz, CA). The signal was detected with secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to

Microarray analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Microarray analysis of gene expression was performed using Mouse GE 4×44K v2
Microarray slides (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, colon tissue was dissected from four pairs of St14− and littermate
St14+ mice. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer.
The quality and the integrity of the RNA was determined by the 2100 Bioanalyzer platform
(Agilent Technologies). Isolated colon RNA together with Universal Mouse Reference RNA
(Agilent Technologies) was labeled using the Two-color Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent
Technologies). Labeled RNA was hybridized to the slides overnight. After washing the
slides were scanned using a High Resolution Microarray Scanner. The raw microarray
image files were read and processed with Feature Extraction Software. The analysis of
microarray data was performed using Gene Spring Software (all from Agilent
Technologies). Gene expression was normalized to the universal reference RNA. From the
original data set, only probes flagged as detected at least in one sample were selected. These
data sets were further filtered for probes with 2-or more fold change in expression between
St14+ and St14− tissue. Statistical analysis of these data sets led to the identification of
probes with significantly different change in gene expression using unpaired Student’s t-test
with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Probes with P < 0.05 were considered
significant and are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Histomorphometric analysis

Author Manuscript

Five control St14− and six antibiotics treated St14− mice were analyzed. To determine the
mucosal thickness, 2 mm of the distal colon mucosa adjacent to squamous epithelium of the
rectum was identified on a H&E section and the area was calculated using Aperio
ImageScope software (Aperio, Vista, CA). For the quantification of proliferation,
differentiation and inflammatory infiltrates, seven individual areas of distal colon on each
slide were selected for counting. The number of counts was normalized to the surface of the
selected area and averaged for each individual animal.

basement membrane marker laminin in 15 week old St14+ (b) and littermate St14− (b′) mice
shows the normal appearance of the basement membrane (example with arrow in b) in
St14+ mice. Loss of matriptase expression leads to increased deposition of laminin
(examples with stars in b′) and loss of normal structure of the basement membrane. (c,c′)
Masson Trichrome staining of the colon of six week old St14+ (c) and littermate St14− (c′)
mice shows connective tissue in the submucosa of a normal colon (example with arrow in
c) and fibrosis of both the mucosa and submucosa of St14− colon (examples with stars in c

colon of eleven week old St14+ (b) and littermate St14− (b′) mice. Red staining shows
mucin in the normal colon (arrows in b). Absence of red staining in (b′) indicates cessation
of mucin production in matriptase-ablated colon. (c,c′,d,d′) Immunohistochemical staining
for T-cells (c,c′) and B-cells (d,d′) in, respectively, seven and 15 week old St14+ (c, d) and

Figure 5. Matriptase-ablated colon is leaky

Author Manuscript

The lumen of the colon and small intestine of weaning age St14+ and littermate
St14−animals was injected with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in PBS (a,b,d,e) or PBS (c,f). After
three min, the intestine was excised, sectioned, and stained for biotin (green). Nuclei were
stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindol (blue). Arrows in a, d, and e show biotin bound to
the surface of the mucosa. Arrowheads in b and the inset in e show biotin labeling of the
basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The diffusion of biotin into intercellular
space was not observed in the normal colon or small intestine (a,d, also compare insets in d
and e). Stars show biotin labeling of connective tissue of both matriptase-ablated colon (b)
and small intestine (e). There was no signal for biotin in colon and small intestine (c,f)
injected with PBS. Scale bar = 20 μm.

Histological appearance of St14+ (a–e) and littermate St14− (a′-e′) colons at postnatal day 0
(a,a′), 5 (b,b′), 10 (c,c′), 15 (d,d′), and 20 (e,e′). No histological differences can be observed
between normal and matriptase-ablated colon at days 0 and 5 (compare a and a′, b and b′).
At day 10, St14− colons show sporadic foci of detaching and apoptotic cells (arrowheads in
c′). This phenotype is significantly stronger at days 15 and 20 with extensive anoikis
(arrowheads in d′), apoptotic cells (arrows in d′, e′), ulcerations (arrowhead in e′) and
inflammatory cell infiltrates (star in e′). Scale bar = 100 μm.

Littermate St14− mice were kept on regular water (control in a–h) or treated with a
combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin in the drinking water
(antibiotics in a–h) for two weeks starting immediately after weaning. The animals were
euthanized, the feces was used for the isolation of bacterial DNA, and the colonic tissue was
subjected to quantitative histomorphometric analysis. (a) PCR quantification of 16S
bacterial ribosomal DNA shows a 1 500-fold decrease in the intestinal microbiota of
antibiotics treated (N=15) compared to control (N=13) mice. (b) Body weight of antibiotics
treated (N=7) and control (N=7) is similar. (c) Decreased thickness of the mucosa of
antibiotics treated (N=6) compared to control (N=5) mice. (d–f) Preservation of mucin
production (d), decreased proliferation (e), and decreased infiltration of B-cells (f), T-cells
(g) and neutrophils (h) in antibiotics treated (N=6) compared to (N=5) mice. Statistical
significance was calculated by Student’s t-test (two-tailed) (a–c, e–h), and non-parametric

Figure 9. Model for matriptase ablation-induced colon carcinogenesis

Author Manuscript

Loss of matriptase from intestinal epithelium compromises epithelial barrier function
thereby causing exposure of the commensal microbiota to resident immune cells. This
triggers a repair response that includes activation of local inflammatory circuits and colonic
stem cell activation. This response is perpetual, rather than transient, due to the intrinsic
inability of matriptase-ablated to form a functional barrier. Persistent hyperproliferation of
colonic stem cells within a DNA damaging chronic inflammatory microenvironment causes
the formation of adenocarcinoma.
