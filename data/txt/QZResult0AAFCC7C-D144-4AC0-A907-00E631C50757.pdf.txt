Insulin-like Growth Factor I Receptor Signaling in COLO205

Abstract
RAV12 is a high-affinity immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) chimeric
antibody recognizing an N-linked carbohydrate epitope
expressed on a number of human carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. RAV12 is efficacious in treating colon, gastric,
and pancreatic tumors in xenograft models in vivo. Insulinlike growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a protein widely
overexpressed in tumor-derived cell lines that promotes cell
survival and prevents apoptosis. We found the RAV12 epitope
(RAAG12) decorated the IGF-IR proteins of RAV12-responsive
cell lines such as COLO201, COLO205, and SNU-16. Here, we
report findings of IGF-IR signaling manipulation by RAV12.
We found that RAV12 caused a significantly accelerated IGFI–mediated IGF-IR phosphorylation and desensitization in
COLO205. We also observed significant changes in some of
the major downstream signaling components of IGF-IR. Data
suggested that RAV12 treatment accelerated the desensitization of Akt/PKB through IRS1, and such activation could be
attenuated by Tyrphostin AG538 (IGF-IR inhibitor),
LY294002, or Wortmannin (phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor). Furthermore, RAV12-inhibited IGF-I stimulated
COLO205 growth, and the inhibition could be significantly
augmented by mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor.

Introduction
Research on cell signaling in cancer biology has provided
invaluable information supporting the development of antibodybased therapy. For instance, studies on ErbB oncogenes led to two
highly efficacious antibody therapeutics: Herceptin for HER2overexpressing breast cancer and Erbitux for epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)–expressing colorectal and lung cancers
(1, 2). Given the existence of EGFR/insulin-like growth factor-IR
(IGF-IR) crosstalk (3, 4), the dependence of EGFR on IGF-IR
pathway (5, 6) and the role of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling in regulating
cell transformation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis (7, 8), IGF-IR may
be a target for future therapeutic development (9, 10).
IGF-IR is a tetrameric glycoprotein made up of two disulfidelinked heterodimers. Each heterodimer is composed of an
extracellular a-subunit, containing the ligand-binding domain,
and a transmembrane h-subunit, containing the tyrosine kinase
domain and ATP binding cassette (11, 12). Upon ligand binding,

IGF-IR undergoes autophosphorylation in the h-subunits and
subsequently activates IRS1 by phosphorylation. IRS1 then serves
as a hub to relay signals to the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway via growth factor receptor bound protein 2 and/
or to the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt/PKB pathway via
the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (11–13). The interplay of these
signaling cascades allows IGF-IR to exert its role in mediating
normal cell growth and cell differentiation (8, 11, 12). Overexpression of IGF-I/IGF-IR is associated with many cancers,
including but not limited to lung cancer (14), neuroblastoma
(15), cervical cancer (16), breast cancer (17), and colorectal cancer
(18). It is now evident that IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling is one of the
major survival pathways in cells (8, 11, 12). Up-regulation of IGF-I/
IGF-IR signaling renders cells resistant to apoptosis under various
conditions such as serum withdrawal (19), UVB irradiation (20, 21),
IFNg/tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) treatment (22), and cytotoxic
agents (23, 24). In fact, down-regulation of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling
can inhibit tumorigenesis, reverse transformed phenotype, and
induce apoptosis (10, 24).
Numerous attempts have been made to induce apoptosis or
growth inhibition in tumors by modification of the IGF-I/IGF-IR
signaling by antagonistic antibodies (24, 25), antisense RNA (15, 24,
26, 27), or dominant negative mutants (14, 24, 26, 27). However,
targeting a ubiquitously expressed and physiologically important
receptor, such as IGF-IR, may well impair its function(s) in healthy
cells and potentially create undesirable side effect(s) (28). An
alternative approach to this problem is to target cancer-associated,
aberrantly expressed carbohydrates on the receptor rather than the
peptide backbone. Recent research in the development of EGFR
antibody therapeutic has shown the feasibility of exploiting
carbohydrate epitopes on the receptor (29–31).
RAV12 is a high-affinity immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) chimeric
antibody recognizing RAAG12, an N-linked carbohydrate epitope
containing Galh1-3GlcNAch1-3Gal. Immunohistochemistry showed
that RAAG12 is expressed in breast, kidney, lung, ovarian, and
prostate tumors. RAAG12 is highly expressed in various gastrointestinal tumors, primary and metastatic colorectal tumors. RAAG12
is also expressed in the cytoplasm of some normal exocrine epithelia
and on the apical surface of gastrointestinal and ductal epithelium.
RAAG12 is neither expressed in normal connective tissues nor in
tissues from the cardiovascular, endocrine, hematolymphatic,
neuromuscular, and central nervous systems. Bioassays also showed
that RAV12 is cytotoxic in vitro and antitumorigenic in various
gastrointestinal xenograft models in vivo. The details of these
studies have been discussed elsewhere (32).
In this report, we use IGF-IR and COLO205 as a model system to
explore the manipulation of receptor signaling by RAV12. Results
indicated that RAV12 enhances IGF-I–mediated IGF-IR phosphorylation and accelerates receptor desensitization. Analysis of
downstream signaling components of IGF-IR reveals a similar
accelerated desensitization profile of the Akt/PKB pathway. These
observations are supported by a functional cell growth assay.

ductal carcinoma cell line; COLO201, COLO205, and HT-29, colorectal
adenocarcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained in F12/DMEM supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 50 Ag/mL
gentamicin. These cultures were incubated in a 37jC incubator with
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell cultures used in this study were 2 to
15 passages from thaw of the ATCC vial.
For serum starvation, cells were washed twice with F12/DMEM and
cultured in serum-free F12/DMEM at 37jC for 16 to 20 h. The medium was
changed, and cells were ready to receive different treatments. Kinase
inhibitors such as Tyrphostin AG538, PD98059, LY294002, and Wortmannin
were reconstituted in DMSO and kept frozen at 20jC. RAV12, IGF-I, and
kinase inhibitor were diluted to appropriate concentration in serum-free
F12/DMEM immediately before use.
Generation of KID3 and its chimeric antibody, RAV12. The method
for generating KID3 monoclonal antibody (Mab) and its chimeric
counterpart, RAV12, have been described elsewhere (32).
Distribution of RAAG12 on membrane proteins. Total cell lysate was
prepared from subconfluent cultures of A549, CaKi2, COLO201, COLO205,
HT-29, SNU-16, and SU.86.86. Approximately 2  106 cells were washed
twice with PBS and lysed in 1 mL ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (RIPA with
protease inhibitors) at 4jC for 15 min. Lysate was cleared by 15,000  g
centrifugation at 4jC for 15 min, and protein content was estimated by BCA
assay. Sandwich ELISA was used to detect RAAG12 on membrane proteins
of these tumor-derived cell lines. Approximately 5 Ag/mL of the following
antibodies, including EGFR, FGFR2iiib, IFNgR1, IGF-IR, IR, EphA2, plateletderived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRa), TfR, transforming growth
factor hR2 (TGFhR2), TNFaR1, TNFaR2, and ALCAM were coated onto
ELISA plates in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4jC overnight. The
plates were washed and blocked with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/
PBS for 1 h. Different dilutions of cell lysates were applied to the plates and
incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed and incubated with 2.5 Ag/mL
biotinylated RAV12 for 1 h. After washing, the plates were further incubated
with 1/3,000 dilution of streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugates for
1 h. After washing, color was developed using TMB substrate kit. Optical
density of the samples was determined at 450 nm and referenced at 650 nm.
Immunodetection of RAAG12 on IGF-IR. Total cell lysate of A549,
CaKi2, COLO201, COLO205, HT-29, SNU-16, and SU.86.86 was prepared as
described above. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with 4 Ag/mL anti–
IGF-IR Mab (R&D Systems, clone 33255) and Dynabeads Protein-G at 4jC
overnight. The immunoprecipitate was washed, boiled in sample loading
buffer, resolved onto 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition and
transferred to 0.45-Am nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding sites
on the membrane were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (TBS with
0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. The presence of RAAG12 on IGF-IR was detected

www.aacrjournals.org

by ECL with 2 Ag/mL biotinylated RAV12 and 1/30,000 dilution of
streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugates. After ECL detection, the
blot was stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Total IGF-IR in the samples was detected by
probing the blot with 2 Ag/mL anti–IGF-IR polyclonal antibody, 1/500
dilution of mouse anti-goat IgG(H + L) alkaline phosphatase conjugates and
developed with NBT/BCIP.
IGF-IR phosphorylation. COLO205 were seeded into 35-mm dishes,
grown to 70% confluency, and serum-starved as described above. For IGF-IR
phosphorylation studies, cells were pretreated with 50 Ag/mL RAV12 at
37jC for 0 to 8 h. At the end of each time point, cells were washed twice
with serum-free F12/DMEM and post-stimulated with 50 ng/mL IGF-I at
37jC for 8 min. Then cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS to stop
the treatment. Total cell lysate prepared in modified RIPA buffer (RIPA
with protease inhibitors and protein phosphatase inhibitors) was immunoprecipitated with 4 Ag/mL anti–IGF-IR Mab and Dynabeads goat antimouse IgG at 4jC overnight. After washing, the immunoprecipitate was
subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane,
and immunoblotted with 2 Ag/mL anti-phosphotyrosine Mab (Upstate,
clone 4G10). Phosphotyrosine content on the IGF-IR h-subunit was
detected by ECL. Total IGF-IR in the samples was also detected as
described above.
For IGF-IR phosphorylation kinetic studies, serum-starved COLO205
were pretreated with 50 Ag/mL RAV12 or serum-free F12/DMEM at 37jC
for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and post-stimulated
with 50 ng/mL IGF-I at 37jC for 0 to 2 h. Total cell lysate was prepared and
analyzed as described above.
The desensitization of IGF-IR phosphorylation was also investigated.
Serum-starved COLO205 were pretreated with 50 Ag/mL RAV12 or serumfree F12/DMEM for 4 h, washed, and stimulated with or without 50 ng/mL
IGF-I (Primary IGF-I challenge) at 37jC for 10 min ( for RAV12-pretreated
samples) or 15 min ( for serum-free F12/DMEM-pretreated samples). Cells
were washed twice with serum-free F12/DMEM and allowed to rest at 37jC
for 20 min. Then cells were restimulated with or without 100 ng/mL IGF-I at
37jC for 10 min (Secondary IGF-I challenge). Total cell lysate was prepared
and analyzed as described above. In these experiments, the band intensity
of both phosphorylated and total IGF-IR was quantified using Kodak
Molecular Imaging Software (Eastman Kodak).
Inhibition of IGF-IR phosphorylation. A cell-free phosphorylation
ELISA was adopted to evaluate the inhibition of IGF-IR phosphorylation
(33). Briefly, RAV12 or anti–IGF-IR polyclonal antibody at 5 Ag/mL each was
coated onto ELISA plates in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4jC
overnight. Plates were washed and blocked with 1.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Total
cell lysate from serum-starved A549 and COLO205 was prepared in ice-cold
Triton lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors]. Different
dilutions of cell lysates were applied to the plates and incubated for 1 h.
After washing, the plates were preincubated with 10 Amol/L Tyrphostin
AG538 (IGF-IR inhibitor) or DMSO control for 30 min. Cell-free
phosphorylation was done in kinase buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5)
containing 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, protease inhibitors and
protein phosphatase inhibitors] in the presence or absence of 100 Amol/L
ATP at 30jC for 30 min. After washing, the plates were incubated with
2.5 Ag/mL anti–phospho-IGF-IRh Mab (Upstate, clone JY202) for 1 h and
1/3,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) horseradish peroxidase
conjugates for 1 h. After washing, color was developed using TMB substrate
kit. Optical density of the sample was determined at 450 nm and referenced
at 650 nm.
Analysis of downstream signaling components of IGF-IR. Luminex
multiplex assay was used to assess the phospho- and total protein of the
following signaling components: IRS1, Akt/PKB, Erk/MAPK1/2, p38SAPK,
c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase 1 (SAPK1), p70S6K,
and HSP27 according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, COLO205 were
serum starved, pretreated with RAV12 or serum-free F12/DMEM, washed,
and post-stimulated with IGF-I as described in IGF-IR phosphorylation
kinetic studies. The lysate was multiplexed with either phosphospecific or
total Beadmate antibodies in filter plates at 4jC overnight. Plates were

washed and incubated with their respective biotinylated Beadmate
antibody pairs for 1 h. After washing, the plates were further incubated
with Beadlyte cell signal amplification buffer for 10 min and streptavidinphycoerythrin for 1 h. Samples were analyzed in the Luminex 100 system.
In some studies, serum-starved COLO205 were pretreated with RAV12
plus specific inhibitor such as 50 Amol/L Tyrphostin AG538, 50 Amol/L
PD98059, 50 Amol/L LY294002, or 100 nmol/L wortmannin, washed, and
post-stimulated with IGF-I in the presence of the same inhibitor. Signaling
components such as IRS1, Akt/PKB, Erk/MAPK1/2, and p70S6K were
analyzed as described above.
Effect of MAPK and PI3K inhibitor on RAV12 growth inhibition. An
optimal dose of IGF-I for use in these studies was determined as follows.
Approximately 2  104 COLO205 per well were seeded into 96-well plates in
serum-free F12/DMEM. After an overnight serum starvation, cells were
cultured with 0 to 1,000 ng/mL IGF-I for 3 days. Cell number in the well was
assessed by CellTiter 96 AQueous one solution cell proliferation assay
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Optical density of the samples was
determined at 490 nm and referenced at 650 nm.
To study the effect of MAPK and PI3K inhibitor on RAV12 growth
inhibition, COLO205 were seeded and serum starved as described above.
Cells were incubated with 50 Ag/mL RAV12 or serum-free F12/DMEM in
the presence or absence of 10 Amol/L LY294002 or 10 Amol/L PD98059.
Cells were further cultured in 100 ng/mL IGF-I for 1 to 3 days. At the end
of each time point, cell number in the well was assessed as described
above.
Statistical analysis. Results obtained from various experiments were
analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Prism (GraphPad Software) softwares.
Differences were evaluated by ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test, and statistical
significance was considered when P < 0.01.

Results
Distribution of RAAG12 on membrane proteins and IGF-IR.
Since RAV12 recognizes an N-linked carbohydrate epitope (32), we
first surveyed its distribution on a subset of membrane proteins
from different tumor-derived cell lines. ELISA screening revealed
that multiple membrane proteins of COLO205 were highly
decorated with RAAG12; this is followed by COLO201, SNU-16,
and SU.86.86 (Fig. 1A). Some of these RAAG12-bearing membrane
proteins were IGF-IR, ALCAM, IFNgR1, TfR, IR, EphA2, and EGFR
(Fig. 1A). We could not detect RAAG12 on membrane proteins of
A549, CaKi2, and HT-29 (data not shown) because these cells
showed limited RAAG12 expression on their cell surface (32).
To confirm RAAG12 was indeed associated with IGF-IR, IGF-IR
in the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated and detected by RAV12.
RAAG12-bearing IGF-IR was found in COLO201, COLO205, and
SNU-16, but not on A549, CaKi2, HT-29, nor SU.86.86 (Fig. 1B). In
COLO201 and COLO205, two RAV12-immunoreactive bands at
130 kDa and 95 kDa were detected and corresponded to the IGFIRa and IGF-IRh subunit, respectively (Fig. 1B and C; ref. 12). While
in SNU-16, a differentially glycosylated a-subunit at 120 kDa was
observed in place of the 130-kDa band (Fig. 1B and C; ref. 34). To
ensure the absence of RAAG12 on IGF-IR was not due to the
absence of IGF-IR in the lysate, the blot in Fig. 1B was stripped and
probed with anti–IGF-IR polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C,
IGF-IR was found in every cell line. These data seemingly suggest
that the decoration of RAAG12 on a subset of membrane proteins,

RAV12 Accelerates Akt/PKB Desensitization via IGF-IR

Figure 2. RAV12 enhances IGF-I–mediated IGF-IR phosphorylation. A, serumstarved COLO205 were pretreated with 50 Ag/mL RAV12 for 0 to 8 h. At the
end of each time point, cells were washed and post-stimulated with 50 ng/mL
IGF-I for 8 min. Total cell lysate was prepared, immunoprecipitated with 4 Ag/mL
anti–IGF-IR Mab, and immunoblotted with 2 Ag/mL anti-phosphotyrosine Mab.
B, the blot, as shown in A , was stripped and probed with 2 Ag/mL anti–IGF-IR

blots are shown. Phosphorylated IGF-IR h-subunit (pIGF-IRb ), IGF-IRa and
IGF-IRh subunits are indicated. C, the phosphorylation level of pIGF-IRh, as
shown in A, was normalized to total IGF-IR level, as shown in B. Results are
expressed as pIGF-IRh/IGF-IR (mean F SD) from six experiments.

such as IGF-IR, is a selective process and is unlikely attributed to
random events.
Effect of RAV12 on IGF-IR phosphorylation. To understand
how RAV12 affects the growth of COLO205, we examined whether
RAV12 can manipulate IGF-IR phosphorylation. When COLO205
were pretreated with RAV12 and post-stimulated with IGF-I, an
enhancement in IGF-IR phosphorylation of the h-subunit was
seen (Fig. 2A and C). Multiple species of phosphorylated hsubunit was observed at about 95 kDa (Fig. 2A). However, RAV12
pretreatment alone was unable to alter basal IGF-IR phosphorylation when IGF-I post-stimulation was omitted (Fig. 4A, i at
0 min). We also found that RAV12-enhanced, IGF-I–mediated
IGF-IR phosphorylation was not associated with changes in the
total amount of IGF-IR (Fig. 2B). The lack of changes in total
IGF-IR proteins after receptor phosphorylation has been reported
previously (35–38).
Inhibition of IGF-IR phosphorylation. To determine whether
the RAV12-enhanced, IGF-I–mediated IGF-IR phosphorylation
is a specific event, Tyrphostin AG538 (IGF-IR inhibitor) was
included in the above phosphorylation studies. Due to high
intracellular substrate level, we could not detect any significant
decrease in IGF-IR phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot procedures. Hence, we employed a cell-free phos-

www.aacrjournals.org

phorylation ELISA to address this question (33). Results indicated that IGF-IR phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by
10 Amol/L Tyrphostin AG538 with inhibition level comparable to
‘‘no ATP’’ phosphorylation. No IGF-IR phosphorylation was
observed in A549 lysate captured with RAV12 (Fig. 3). The failure
of RAV12-captured A549 lysate to yield IGF-IR phosphorylation is
consistent with the fact that A549 contains no RAAG12-bearing
IGF-IR (Fig. 1B). In contrast, a comparable in vitro phosphorylation profile was noted in COLO205 regardless of capture
antibody used (Fig. 3).
Effect of RAV12 on kinetics of IGF-IR phosphorylation. Next,
we compared IGF-IR phosphorylation kinetics in the presence of
RAV12. RAV12-pretreated, IGF-I–stimulated COLO205 exhibited
significant, transient increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A,
i and v). The increase occurred at 5 min post IGF-I stimulation
and was in decline by 15 min. Thereafter, IGF-IR phosphorylation
remained constantly low over the course of the experiment (Fig. 4A,
i and v). A similar increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation was also
detected in COLO205 that received only IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 4A,
iii and v). However, contrary to the time course seen with RAV12
pretreatment, IGF-IR phosphorylation peaked at about 15–20 min
following IGF-I stimulation, a 5–10 min delay versus RAV12pretreated samples. Then IGF-IR phosphorylation declined at a
much more gradual rate when compared with RAV12 pretreatment
(Fig. 4A, iii and v).
To correlate whether this RAV12-accelerated, IGF-IR dephosphorylation is due to receptor desensitization, we deliberately
restimulated COLO205 after their exposure to primary IGF-IR
stimulation. Results indicated that a robust IGF-IR phosphorylation was produced in the absence of RAV12 (Fig. 4B). As predicted,
IGF-IR became refractory to IGF-I restimulation when COLO205
were previously exposed to both RAV12 and IGF-I (Fig. 4B). The
phosphorylation levels obtained in these studies were readily
comparable to previous observations (Figs. 2; 4A, v). Similarly, basal

(5 Ag/mL) or anti-IGF-IR polyclonal antibody (5 Ag/mL). Cell-free phosphorylation
was done with or without 10 Amol/L Tyrphostin AG538 (IGF-IRi ) and in the
presence (ATP ) or absence of 100 Amol/L ATP (No ATP ). Phosphorylated

IGF-IR phosphorylation was minimal when IGF-I stimulation was
omitted (Fig. 4A, v at 0 min; Fig. 4B without primary or secondary
IGF-I challenge), and no significant changes in total IGF-IR were
detected following receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, ii and iv).
Therefore, RAV12 accelerates IGF-IR phosphorylation and causes
receptor desensitization.
Analysis of downstream signaling components of IGF-IR. To
further explore the effect of RAV12 on IGF-IR intracellular
signaling, a series of IGF-IR downstream signaling components
was evaluated. The total protein of each signaling component
remained constant throughout the experiments (data not shown).
We started the analysis with IRS1, Erk/MAPK1/2, Akt/PKB, and
p70S6K. IRS1 phosphorylation essentially mirrored the kinetics of
IGF-IR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, v). RAV12 pretreatment induced a
sharp, transient increase in IRS1 phosphorylation at 10 min to be
followed by a sharp decrease and return to the basal level (Fig. 5A).
Without RAV12 pretreatment, IGF-I stimulation produced a more
gradual increase in the IRS1 phosphorylation and followed by a

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

gradual decrease back to the basal level (Fig. 5A). Similar trends in
Akt/PKB phosphorylation were noted, in which RAV12 quickly
accelerated Akt/PKB phosphorylation and desensitization when
compared with IGF-I stimulation alone (Fig. 5B). Unlike IRS1
phosphorylation, Akt/PKB phosphorylation was never restored to
its original level at 2 h (Fig. 5B). Apparently, RAV12 could not affect
the phosphorylation profile of either Erk/MAPK1/2 or p70S6K
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Nevertheless, unique observations
were noted for these components: the basal Erk/MAPK1/2
phosphorylation was unexpectedly high when compared with
other signaling components studied (Supplementary Fig. S1A), and
p70S6K became constitutively active after its initial phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We hypothesize these results from
the fact that both components are targets of a multitude of kinases
activated following IGF-IR phosphorylation (12, 13). For instance,
IGF-I trans-activated EGFR (5, 6) or Src homology and collagen (5)
can phosphorylate MAPK; atypical PKC (39) or mTOR (40) can
phosphorylate p70S6K.

RAV12 Accelerates Akt/PKB Desensitization via IGF-IR

We also studied two stress-activated MAPK pathways frequently
associated with IGF-IR signaling, namely, JNK/SPAK1 and p38SAPK
(13). JNK/SAPK1, a component that regulates IRS1 phosphorylation
(41), revealed no significant changes in its phosphorylation under
either condition (data not shown). p38SAPK, a component modified by Akt/PKB (42), revealed a similar accelerated desensitization
profile after RAV12 pretreatment (Fig. 5C). We also observed a
similar trend for HSP27 (Fig. 5D), a component distantly downstream to p38SAPK and Akt/PKB (42).
To confirm the effect of RAV12 on IGF-IR intracellular signaling,
inhibitors to IGF-IR, MAPK, or PI3K were included in the RAV12
pretreatment. By inhibiting IGF-IR phosphorylation with Tyrphostin AG538 (IGF-IR inhibitor), all the downstream signaling
components of IGF-IR examined were significantly inhibited
(Supplementary Table S1). On the other hand, PD98059 (MAPK
inhibitor), LY294002, or wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) inhibited
only its intended target(s) (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly,
the degree of inhibition by IGF-IR inhibitor was very different
from MAPK inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor. Tyrphostin AG538 caused
50% inhibition versus more than 85% inhibition caused by

PD98059, LY294002, or wortmannin. Through IGF-IR, RAV12
exerts its effect on a number of intracellular signaling components
including, but not limited to, the accelerated desensitization of
Akt/PKB pathway.
Effect of MAPK and PI3K inhibitor on RAV12 growth
inhibition. We previously showed that RAV12 treatment acts on
Akt/PKB pathway of IGF-IR signaling. Therefore, we investigated
how this signaling event affects COLO205 growth under IGF-I
stimulation. An optimal dose of IGF-I at 100 ng/mL was selected
based on the growth characteristic of COLO205 (Fig. 6A). Under
such condition, RAV12 alone caused a significant growth
inhibition on COLO205 (Fig. 6B). The combination of RAV12 with
MAPK inhibitor generated an additive effect on RAV12 growth
inhibition (Fig. 6B). We believe this combination produces a dual
inhibition of PI3K and MAPK pathways, the two major pathways
for cell survival and cell proliferation of IGF-IR signaling. Despite
RAV12 and PI3K inhibitor working through the same pathway,
their combination generated only a small increase in RAV12
growth inhibition (Fig. 6B). One explanation for this may partly be
due to the incomplete inhibition of Akt/PKB phosphorylation by

Figure 5. Analysis of downstream signaling components of IGF-IR. Serum-starved COLO205 were pretreated with 50 Ag/mL RAV12 (.) or F12/DMEM (o) for 4 h
and post-stimulated with 50 ng/mL IGF-I for 0 to 2 h as described in Materials and Methods. Total cell lysate was prepared and four downstream signaling components
of IGF-IR such as IRS1 (A), Akt/PKB (B), p38SAPK (C ), and HSP27 (D ) were analyzed by Luminex multiplex assay. Results are expressed as % phospho-protein/total
protein (%P/T , mean F SD) of duplicate wells from six experiments.

PI3K inhibitor (Supplementary Table S1). In essence, RAV12
inhibits COLO205 growth, and the inhibition can be augmented by
MAPK inhibitor.

Discussion
Carbohydrate epitopes, such as those found in mucin-like
molecules, glycolipids, or glycoproteins, have been used as markers
for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (43, 44). Targeting these
carbohydrate epitopes found on the cell surface creates a new
class of antibody therapeutics that can selectively recognize tumorassociated antigens and offer broad specificity to various protein
targets containing such antigens. However, the therapeutic value of
these naked anti-carbohydrate antibodies would be increased with
a better understanding of signal transduction events occurring in
the target cells. To date, their uses have largely been restricted as
toxin- or radio-conjugates (C242-DM4, ImmunoGen, Inc.; antiLewis Y, Seattle Genetics, Inc.) due to the minimal, or lack of,

activity of these Mabs as naked antibodies. The findings in this
report that RAV12, an anti-carbohydrate Mab, can regulate tumor
growth, in part, through the manipulation of growth factor
receptor(s) suggests a mechanism that might contribute to the
development of naked anti-carbohydrate Mabs for cancer therapies.
RAV12 recognizes an N-linked carbohydrate epitope expressed
on various adenocarcinomas (32). Unlike other known tumorspecific carbohydrate antigens, RAAG12 is shown to be located on
a number of well-characterized drug targets such as IGF-IR,
IFNgR1, TfR, IR, EphA2, and EGFR in a subset of tumor-derived cell
lines (Fig. 1). It is conceivable that RAV12 may modulate the
function(s) of one or more such receptors through its binding to
the carbohydrate epitope on the receptors, and this may contribute
to an eventual inhibition of tumor growth and/or tumor death.
Among those RAAG12-bearing receptors, we show that at least one,
IGF-IR, is affected by RAV12 (Figs. 2 and 4).
Although RAV12 by itself cannot activate IGF-IR, its binding to
COLO205 facilitates the ligand-dependent activation and desensitization of IGF-IR phosphorylation (Figs. 2 and 4). This accelerated
desensitization profile of IGF-IR phosphorylation is also reflected
in several downstream signaling components such as IRS1, Akt/
PKB, and p38SAPK (Fig. 5A–C). Akt/PKB is an important interlink
on the signaling pathway by integrating extracellular signals from
various receptors, such as IGF-IR, to many intracellular signaling
molecules including GSK-3, mTOR, p70S6K, BAD, NFnB, and
Forkhead (13). Their subsequent phosphorylations allow Akt/PKB
to regulate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (45–47). Therefore, Akt/PKB dysregulation, or persistent
activation, is one of the major underlying causes of tumorigenesis,
tumor metastasis, and resistance to cancer therapies (45–47).
The ability of RAV12 to accelerate the desensitization of IGF-IR and
its downstream components, such as Akt/PKB, suggests RAV12
growth inhibition may also work in an Akt/PKB-dependent
pathway.
Indeed, results from in vitro assay support such a hypothesis.
When COLO205 were cultured in the presence of IGF-I, RAV12
significantly inhibits its cell growth. The inhibition can be
significantly enhanced by manipulating the IGF-IR signaling with
MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 6B). It is known that IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling is
one of the most responsive pathways in cells of the gastrointestinal
tract (48), and most importantly, our studies illustrated that a
significant population of IGF-IR is decorated with RAAG12 in some
of the RAV12-responsive cell lines (Fig. 1). In essence, the
desensitization of IGF-IR signaling should be sufficient to account
for a portion of the inhibition of tumor growth.
It was reported that anti-carbohydrate antibodies, such as antiblood group A carbohydrate Mab (29, 30) or anti-Lewis Y Mab (31),
inhibited receptor function of epitope-bearing EGFR. However, it
remains uncertain how the binding of RAV12 to a carbohydrate
epitope on IGF-IR can induce such changes as described above
(Figs. 2 and Figs. 4–6). Results from confocal microscopy studies
may offer a possible explanation by showing that RAV12 can
aggregate or cross-link RAAG12-bearing membrane protein(s) over
time.1 Because aggregation or cross-linking of membrane proteins
is known to activate or sensitize receptors to ligand stimulation
(49, 50), we believe that RAV12 may also act on receptor(s) in a
similar manner.

RAV12 Accelerates Akt/PKB Desensitization via IGF-IR

However, modulation of IGF-IR signaling may not be the sole
mechanism for RAV12 growth inhibition. RAV12 causes a stronger
growth inhibition on COLO205 in serum-containing conditions (32)
than in IGF-I supplemented serum-free medium. We speculate that
the presence of multiple cytokines or growth factors in serum may
allow RAV12 to modulate ligand-dependent signaling of other
RAAG12-bearing receptor(s) besides IGF-IR. We also believe that
RAV12 may exert its activity through a combination of RAAG12bearing receptor(s) varying across different tumor-derived cell
lines.1 Despite the fact that RAAG12 is present on various receptors
on colorectal cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A), it is very unlikely that
RAV12 will affect normal cellular functions because RAAG12 is
undetectable on the same set of receptors such as IGF-IR, ALCAM,
IFNgR1, TfR, IR, EphA2, and EGFR in normal adult colon cell
lysates.1 We suspect that the decoration of RAAG12 on receptors
may result from the dysregulation of glycosylation pathway in

explore this area. In summary, our results clearly indicate that
RAV12 affects the Akt/PKB pathway of IGF-IR signaling in
COLO205. The fact that RAV12 can target and/or modulate other
RAAG12-bearing receptor(s) might be advantageous when compared with other antibody therapeutics currently used in cancer
therapies that only target a single, specific receptor.
