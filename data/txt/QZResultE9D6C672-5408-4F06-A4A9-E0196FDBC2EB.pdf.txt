ABSTRACT
Dormant or slow-cycling disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow (BM)
are resistant to conventional therapy in various cancers including head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), although the molecular mechanisms remain
largely unknown. This study aimed to identify the intrinsic molecular mechanisms
underlying drug resistance in BM-DTCs. We used in vivo selection of the human HNSCC
cell line HEp3, which mimics non-proliferative BM-DTCs in mice, to establish BM-DTCderived (BM-HEp3) and lung metastases-derived (Lu-HEp3) sublines. Both sublines
had higher migration activity and shortened survival in a murine xenograft model
compared with parental (P-HEp3) cells. Slow-cycling BM-HEp3 cells had intrinsically
enhanced cisplatin resistance compared with Lu-HEp3 cells, which also manifested
this resistance but proliferated rapidly. The drug resistance and slow-cycling state
of BM-HEp3 cells depended on enhanced positive feedback of the signaling axis of
stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) via their
overexpression. Interestingly, BM-DTCs highly expressed transforming growth factorbeta 2 (TGF-β2) to maintain SDF-1-CXCR4 overexpression. Inhibition of SDF-1-CXCR4
signaling by down-regulating TGF-β2 fully reversed the drug resistance of BM-HEp3
cells via reactivation of cell proliferation. These data suggest that the intrinsic TGFβ2-triggered SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling axis is crucial for drug resistance dependent on
a slow-cycling state in BM-DTCs.

with reduced metastasis-free survival, even for cancers in
which overt skeletal metastases, such as head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), are rare [1,3,4].
These findings suggest that BM-DTCs eventually leave
dormancy, which is functionally defined by quiescence, to
initiate metastasis [5]. Also, the BM can be the source for
dissemination into other organs [6]. One most important
obstacle to be overcome in cancer therapy is resistance
of BM-DTCs to conventional chemotherapeutic agents
[7,8]. Their drug resistance may result from coordinated
growth arrest and a survival scheme that allow longterm dormancy [9]. Understanding how these cells resist
conventional therapy and persist in a viable state for
prolonged periods is of fundamental clinical interest.
Chemotherapeutic drug resistance in BM-DTCs
may arise from interactions between cell-intrinsic and
environment-mediated mechanisms [7,8]. Indeed,
components in the BM environment can protect DTCs
from chemotherapeutic agents by similar mechanisms [7].
However, whether such de novo mechanisms are sufficient
for BM-DTC resistance, i.e., whether any cancer cells
can become dormant and lead to residual disease only if
they are in the BM microenvironment, remains unknown.
Recent studies on organ-specific metastatic traits revealed
that only a small population of cancer cells with a unique
survival mechanism can survive in the BM or lung
[10,11] and that DTCs in each organ (e.g., lung, liver,
and BM) have distinct, intrinsic molecular characteristics
[12]. Moreover, the likelihood of metastasis to certain
organs may be predicted from gene expression patterns
of primary tumors [13-15]. These findings suggest the
presence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms in DTCs or
metastatic cells that may be preselected in primary tumors
and that differ in terms of the organs where they lodge
(e.g., lung vs. BM). However, whether intrinsic properties
are involved in drug resistance in DTCs in the BM or
other sites is yet unknown because of the lack of studies
on DTCs themselves. This issue may have implications for
the general question of whether DTCs or metastatic cells
in various sites respond similarly to the same therapies.
In vivo selection is effective in differentiating
highly disseminating or metastatic subpopulations
from an original cell mixture, more effective, in fact,
than direct analyses of cancer cell populations that
were established from patients and that are likely
heterogeneous, with different genomic characteristics
and abilities to metastasize to distant secondary sites
[12,16,17]. The human HNSCC cell line HEp3 produces
overt spontaneous metastasis in multiple organs, such
as lung and lymph nodes in murine and avian systems,
and it mimics metastasis in patients with HNSCCs [4].
This model has non-proliferative DTCs in the BM, as
observed in HNSCCs and other malignancies [2,18]. In
the present study, we utilized the HEp3 system to identify
intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance
in BM-DTCs, which may induce BM-DTCs to remain
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dormant for long-term periods. To achieve this goal, we
compared the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of
a BM-derived subpopulation with not only the parental
population but also lung-derived metastatic cells as
another aggressive population.

RESULTS
Aggressive Phenotypic Features of BM-Derived
DTCs
The HNSCC cell line HEp3 forms metastases in
multiple organs such as lungs, lymph nodes, liver, and
spleen in mice and in avian systems [18,20]. These cells
are known to not develop bone metastases, at least in
the same time frame as for development of spontaneous
metastases in lungs and lymph nodes, and this model
mimics the behavior of non-proliferative DTCs in the BM
in patients with HNSCCs [1,18,21].
To
clarify
the
mechanism
underlying
chemotherapeutic drug resistance in dormant or slowcycling DTCs in the BM, we established BM- and lungderived DTC sublines (Figure 1A). We injected HEp3
cells expressing green fluorescent protein subcutaneously
into mice. After 4-5 weeks, we isolated HEp3 cells from
the injection site, which we designated the parental line
P-HEp3, and DTCs from the BM and the lung metastases.
We expanded these two groups of DTCs in culture and
then reinjected them into mice. We repeated this in vivo
transplantation five times. Isolated DTCs from the BM
and the lung metastases after the fifth transplantation were
named BM-HEp3 and Lu-HEp3, respectively (Figure 1A,
left panel). GFP expression of P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and
BM-HEp3 cells was confirmed (Figure 1A, right panels).
Consistent with previous reports [1,18,20], although
overt metastases were observed in the lung at 5 weeks at
the latest after injection, visible skeletal metastases did
not occur throughout the five transplantations (data not
shown). We analyzed the phenotypic characteristics of
these BM- and lung-derived sublines and compared them
with those of P-HEp3.
One of the obviously different characteristics in the
HEp3 sublines was cell morphology (Figure 1B). Almost
all P-HEp3 cells had a star shape with many filopodialike protrusions. The shape of the Lu-HEp3 cells mostly
resembled that of the P-HEp3 cells but had longer
dendrite- or axon-like protrusions. The BM-HEp3 cells
looked quite different from the parental and Lu-HEp3
cells: they were larger and had a fibroblastic appearance,
with few or no protrusions. These data indicated that BMHEp3 and Lu-HEp3 cells were distinct populations even
though they both originated from a single cell line. To
evaluate their functional differences, we performed the
wound-healing assay (Figure 1C). Lu-HEp3 and BM1009

HEp3 cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (5 × 106) were injected subcutaneously (S.C.) into mice. At 30-40 days after
injection, HEp3 cells in the primary site (P-HEp3) and DTCs in lung and BM were isolated and then expanded in monolayer culture. After
subconfluent growth, lung- and BM-derived cells were injected subcutaneously into mice again. These transplantations were repeated
five times, and the resultant sublines derived from BM and lung were called BM-HEp3 and Lu-HEp3, respectively. Phase-contrast and

HEp3 cells had markedly enhanced motility compared
with the parental line, a characteristic that supported their
high disseminating capacity.
To confirm this potential aggressive dissemination,
we injected mice subcutaneously with cells from different
lines. Although no significant difference in tumor growth
rate occurred (Figure 1D), the survival times of mice
bearing BM-HEp3 or Lu-HEp3 tumors were significantly
shorter than that of mice with P-HEp3 cells (Figure 1E).
Together, these data indicate that both Lu- and BM-derived
subpopulations had more aggressive characteristics
compared with their parental population, at least with
regard to disseminating ability.

We next assessed the sensitivity of these cell lines
to cisplatin, one of the most effective and commonly
used chemotherapeutic drugs for HNSCC and many other
solid tumors [22]. We found that Lu-HEp3 and BM-HEp3
cells had decreased sensitivity to cisplatin compared with
P-HEp3 cells (Figure 2C). BM-HEp3 cells, however, had
markedly enhanced resistance compared with Lu-HEp3
cells (Figure 2C), which is consistent with their greater
survival ability. These data indicate that BM-DTCs
were intrinsically slow-cycling and were resistant to an
anticancer drug, with an enhanced survival ability

Resistance in BM-DTCs

We next investigated the proliferation and survival
of each cell line in vitro. We found that BM-HEp3 cell
proliferation was significantly slower than proliferation of
P-HEp3 cells, whereas Lu-HEp3 cells proliferated rapidly
(Figure 2A). Although survival of Lu-HEp3 and P-HEp3
cells under serum-free conditions did not appear to differ,
the survival rate of BM-HEp3 cells was significantly
higher than that of the other cell lines (Figure 2B).

Growth arrest is associated with increased survival
and chemoresistance in BM-DTCs [23]. We therefore
hypothesized that the slow-cycling state actually
observed in BM-HEp3 cells contributes to acquisition of
chemoresistance in these cells.
The signaling mediated by the chemokine SDF-1
(also called CXCL12) and its cognate receptor CXCR4 has
a central role in BM homing and is also required for the

quiescence and retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the
BM [7]. In view of these known functions, we compared
the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in BM-HEp3 cells
with that in the other cell lines. As Figure 3A illustrates,
gene expression of both SDF-1 and CXCR4 in BM-HEp3
cells was much higher than that in the other cell lines.
No significant difference in expression of these genes
between P-HEp3 and Lu-HEp3 cells was observed. We
confirmed increased CXCR4 protein level in BM-HEp3
cells compared to the other cell lines (Figure 3A). These
data indicated that SDF-1-CXCR4 was constitutively
enhanced in BM-DTCs. Treatment with AMD3100, a
CXCR4-specific inhibitor [24], dramatically suppressed
SDF-1 transcription in BM-HEp3 cells, which indicated
that SDF-1 expression depended an enhanced CXCR4
downstream signal (Figure 3B). Together, these data
suggest that BM-DTCs maintained a positive feedback
SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling loop.

We next studied whether this SDF-1-CXCR4
signaling was involved in the slow-cycling state and
chemoresistance in BM-derived DTCs. We found
that inhibition of CXCR4 significantly promoted cell
proliferation in BM-HEp3 cells, although no significant
change in P-HEp3 and Lu-HEp3 cells occurred (Figure
3C). As a striking result, CXCR4 inhibition led to full
reversal of the sensitivity to cisplatin in BM-HEp3 cells,
to the same level as that in parental P-HEp3 cells (Figure
3D). Another notable finding was that CXCR4 inhibition
did not affect cisplatin sensitivity in the P-HEp3 cells and
Lu-HEp3 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that
enhanced SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling, likely triggered by
CXCR4 overexpression, was required for maintenance of
the slow-cycling state and drug resistance in BM-DTCs,
which confirmed the close relationship among these
phenotypes in BM-DTCs.

Overexpression of CXCR4 and SDF-1 in BMDTCs Requires Transforming Growth FactorBeta 2 (TGF-β2)

In several types of cancer including HNSCC, TGF-β
is a critical regulator of not only hematopoietic stem
cell hibernation in the BM [25] but also of metastatic
processes, including tumor cell colonization, cell
dormancy, and metastatic progression, in distant organs
such as bone [18,26-28]. We therefore first assessed
expression of all TGF-β isoforms—TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and

In view of the above findings, we next investigated
the mechanisms of CXCR4 overexpression in BM-DTCs.

TGF-β3. Our real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed
significantly increased TGF-β2 gene expression in BMHEp3 cells compared with P-HEp3 cells (Figure 4A). In
contrast, TGF-β2 expression in Lu-HEp3 cells was much
lower than that in P-HEp3 cells. A notable result was that
in BM-HEp3 cells, expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3
was significantly decreased compared with that in P-HEp3
cells, whereas Lu-HEp3 cells showed increased TGF-β1
expression compared with P-HEp3 cells.
We then investigated whether elevated TGF-β2
expression was involved in the expression of CXCR4 or
SDF-1. Indeed, TGF-β2 knockdown via siRNA led to a
dramatic decrease in expression of both CXCR4 and
SDF-1 in BM-HEp3 cells, but P-HEp3 cells showed no
apparent change in CXCR4 and SDF-1 expression (Figure
4B). Of note, TGF-β2 knockdown significantly increased
expression of both genes in Lu-HEp3 cells (Supplementary
Figure S1). CXCR4 inhibition had no apparent effect on
TGF-β2 transcription in BM-HEp3 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2). These results indicated that an enhanced SDF1-CXCR4 signaling axis in BM-DTCs depended strongly
on the TGF-β2 signal in a cell-autonomous fashion.
In addition, knockdown of TGF-β2 expression
stimulated proliferation of only BM-HEp3 cells, in a
similar manner as did CXCR4 inhibition (Figure 4C).
Addition of TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 significantly increased
proliferation of these cells (Figure 4D). Moreover, we
found that knockdown of TGF-β2 completely abolished
cisplatin resistance in BM-HEp3 cells, but we did not

note any change in cisplatin sensitivity in P-HEp3 and
Lu-HEp3 cells, which we did observe when CXCR4
was inhibited (Figure 4E). Taken together, our data
demonstrate that TGF-β2 overexpression was responsible
for an enhanced SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling axis and for
the subsequent chemoresistance and slow-cycling state in
BM-derived DTCs (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION
Dormant or slow-cycling DTCs, which often occur
in the BM, are resistant to conventional therapy and are
thought to be a cause of relapse and metastasis in cancers.
However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
drug resistance of these cells are still poorly understood.
Using an in vivo selection approach, we demonstrated
here that in BM-derived DTCs, but not in the primary cell
population or in a lung metastatic derivative, autocrine
TGF-β2 maintained the drug resistance and a slow-cycling
state via enhancement of the SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling
axis.
Our data showed that the drug-resistant phenotype
of the BM-derived DTCs (BM-HEp3 cells) was closely
linked to the slow-cycling state, whereas lung-derived
metastatic cells (Lu-HEp3 cells) manifested a different
modality. Slow-cycling tumor cells are known to be more
drug-resistant than other tumor cells, although direct
proof of this is lacking [23]. Indeed, this coordinated
growth arrest and survival program would favor longterm persistence of DTCs in the BM microenvironment,

Figure 5: A proposed mechanism of drug resistance and the slow-cycling state in BM-DTCs. This scheme summarizes

data from this and other studies and presents a model illustrating how cell-autonomous and BM microenvironment-mediated mechanisms
may synergistically contribute to drug resistance and a slow-cycling state in DTCs. As demonstrated in our study, BM-DTCs overexpress
TGF-β2 through a yet unknown mechanism. This cytokine maintains expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1, which results in drug resistance
and a slow-cycling state in a cell-autonomous fashion. SDF-1 and TGF-β2 in the BM microenvironment may facilitate these signaling
pathways, which may contribute to creating conditions that would allow DTCs to persist as dormant residual disease.

as clinically observed. Our evidence suggests that DTCs
lodged in the BM elicit this trait themselves, through an
intrinsic mechanism: a positive feedback SDF-1-CXCR4
signaling loop, which is a frequently observed autocrine
system [29] and, in this case, is likely to be initiated by
CXCR4 overexpression. The SDF-1-CXCR4 axis has
reportedly promoted drug resistance through several
signaling pathways including activated focal adhesion
kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase, and Akt [7].
Our data suggest that such a protective effect is dominant
in BM-DTCs and that this major effect may result from
high expression levels of SDF-1 and CXCR4. SDF-1
is a chemokine that is abundant in the BM. Thus, SDF1-CXCR4 axis-mediated homing of tumor cells to the
BM is commonly observed in various hematopoietic
malignancies [30] and carcinomas including HNSCC
[6,31,32], whereas inhibition of CXCR4 blocks this
homing [7]. This signaling axis is also indispensable for
quiescence and retention of hematopoietic stem cells
in the BM [7,33]. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR4
by AMD3100 mobilizes tumor cells out of the BM and
leads to increased chemosensitivity, although the effect of
this treatment on the cell cycle remains to be determined
[7]. Taken together, our data suggest that CXCR4
overexpression, which can trigger SDF-1 expression, and
the corresponding drug resistance and/or slow proliferation
are common characteristics of DTCs in the BM, even
though the mechanism of CXCR4 overexpression is still
largely unexplained.
In our study here, we identified TGF-β2, which is
also highly expressed in BM-DTCs, as an essential and
sufficient factor for maintaining high CXCR4/SDF-1
expression and drug resistance and a slow-cycling state
in BM-DTCs. Recent studies showed that TGF-β2 and
TGF-β1 can induce CXCR4 expression in several types
of tumor cells including HNSCC cells [34-37] and
leukocytes [38-40], via TGF-β type I receptor-dependent
non-Smad signaling pathways. Functionally, TGF-β2
is an established inducer of epithelial and mesenchymal
transition, an important process for tumor cell
dissemination [41]. Epithelial and mesenchymal transition
increases cell survival and drug resistance [42]. Notably,
TGF-β-induced epithelial and mesenchymal transition and
survival require induction of CXCR4 expression [35,43].
Our data (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S1)
indicate the involvement of unique or dominant signaling
pathways in BM-DTCs. Although TGF-β isoforms
share several signaling pathways [41], the roles of these
isoforms in cell proliferation, especially metastatic tumor
growth, are different. Our evidence (Figure 4A and D)
suggests that the slow-cycling state of BM-DTCs is
maintained by not only enhanced TGF-β2 expression
but also down-regulation of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3. In
fact, TGF-β2 functions as a growth suppressor in normal
and cancer cells [18,25,44]. However, TGF-β1 induces
prometastatic growth of DTCs in bone and lung [26www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

28]. In addition, TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, but not TGF-β2,
are abundant in vigorous metastases in bones of patients
with breast cancer [10]. Thus, the differential expression
pattern of each TGF-β isoform in slow-cycling BMHEp3 cells may reflect unique roles for these proteins
in metastatic progression. Additional investigations
to elucidate molecular mechanisms regulating TGF-β
isoform expression and CXCR4 signaling may give novel
insights into the coordinated growth arrest and survival
program of BM-DTCs.
As recent studies demonstrated [45], the behavior
of DTCs in certain organs results from interaction of
DTCs and their microenvironments. An important finding
was the abundance of both TGF-β2 and SDF-1 in the
BM microenvironment of humans and mice [18,46,47].
This result suggests synergism of TGF-β2, SDF-1, and
CXCR4 in tumor cells and the BM microenvironment,
as observed in other sites [29,38,48]. Thus, we propose
that this enhancing mechanism enables the quiescent
BM-DTC phenotype with increased drug resistance
to persist as dormant residual disease (Figure 5). This
proposal is supported by a recent study in which BM
microenvironment-derived TGF-β2 was required for
BM-DTC quiescence in this HEp3-HNSCC model and
a breast cancer model [18]. An interesting possibility is
that specific cells in the primary tumor cell population
that can easily adapt to the microenvironments where the
cells will lodge may be preselected for metastatic tropism
[46,49]. In this regard, it should be noted that BM-HEp3
tumor led to shorter mouse survival than P-HEp3 even
though apparent skeletal metastases did not occur, which
suggest that BM-Hep3 subpopulation also have propensity
for dissemination to distant organs (e.g., lung) other than
BM. Additional investigations may provide evidence to
support this hypothesis if intrinsic mechanisms of drug
resistance in DTCs in each organ also are consistent with
the “seed and soil” theory of metastasis that was proposed
to explain the metastatic preference of certain cancer cells
for specific organs [50].
In conclusion, we used the HNSCC model to
demonstrate here, for the first time, that the autocrine
TGF-β2-SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling axis is crucial for
drug resistance and the slow-cycling state in BM-DTCs.
Inhibition of CXCR4 or TGF-β2 may be a promising
strategy to overcome this drug resistance in BM-DTCs
and prevent HNSCC recurrence. Our data emphasize the
importance of understanding cell-autonomous mechanisms
underlying drug resistance in DTCs and metastatic cells,
mechanisms that may differ in organs where such cells
lodge (e.g., primary tumor, lung, and BM), as related to
microenvironment-derived protective functions.

METHODS

Tumor Xenograft Generation
For survival experiments, P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and
BM-HEp3 cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS,
after which aliquots containing 5 × 106 cells of the cell
lines were injected subcutaneously into the left axilla of
each mouse (n = 4/group). The health of the mice and
evidence of tumor growth were evaluated every 3-4 days.
Tumor development was monitored in individual animals
by using sequential caliper measurements of length (L)
and width (W). Tumor volume was calculated via the
formula LW2π/6.

Cell Lines and Cell Culture
HEp3 cells expressing green fluorescent protein
(HEp3) were kindly provided by Dr. Zijlstra. HEp3 cells
were originally derived from a lymph node metastasis
of a patient with HNSCC [19]. We established the lung
metastases-derived and BM-DTC-derived cell lines from
lung and BM preparations, respectively (see below). Cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Gibco) in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator at 37°C unless otherwise stated.

Wound-Healing Assay
Cell migration ability was analyzed by using a
wound-healing assay. P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and BM-HEp3
cells (9 × 104 cells/ml) were seeded in 12-well plates and
incubated at 37°C. Subconfluent monolayer cells were
wounded by scratching, after which they were incubated at
37°C in serum-free medium. After 12 hours, cell migration
into the wound area was visualized with a phase-contrast
microscope and was photographed.

Establishment of BM- and Lung-Derived Cell
Lines
Crlj:SHO-Prkdcscid Hrhr mice, 4-6 weeks old, were
purchased from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan)
and maintained at the Center for Animal Resources and
Development of Kumamoto University. The mice were
handled according to the animal care policy of Kumamoto
University. HEp3 cells were harvested and resuspended in
PBS, after which 5 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the left axilla of each mouse. The mice were killed
30-40 days after injection, and a necropsy was performed
immediately. The thigh bone was separated from the body
at the joints. After skin and muscle were removed with a
scalpel, both ends of the long bone were cut open. A 20-ml
syringe with a 26-gauge needle was filled with 10 ml of
PBS and inserted into one end of the long bone. Applying
pressure to the syringe forced out the BM cells and tumor
cells from the other end. Lungs were excised from the
mice and minced in PBS containing DISPASE II (2.5
mg/ml; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan).
Each BM and lung suspension was seeded in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco).
After subconfluent growth was observed, lung- and BMderived tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into
mice again. These in vivo transplantations were repeated
five times. Tumor cell lines derived from the BM and
lung after the fifth transplantation were designated BMHEp3 and Lu-HEp3, respectively. In addition, HEp3 cells
isolated from the injection site after the first injection was
named P-HEp3, the parental line. Images of cells were
taken using an EVOS fl Digital Inverted Fluorescence
Microscope (Advanced Microscopy Group, Bothell, WA,
USA).

Cell Proliferation Assay
P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and BM-HEp3 cells (9 × 104
cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates. At the indicated
times, viable cells in each well were quantified by using
the Luna Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems,
Annandale, VA, USA). In some cases, cells were treated
with recombinant human TGF-β1, TGF-β3 (10 ng/ml;
PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), or the highly selective
CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (5 µM; Abcam, Cambridge,
UK), or cells were transfected with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting TGF-β2.

Transfection with siRNA
P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and BM-HEp3 cells were
transfected with TGF-β2-specific siRNA by using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Silencer Negative Control (Ctrl) siRNA
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster
City, CA, USA) was used as the control. The
sequences of the TGF-β2-specific siRNA were sense
5′-CUGAACAACGGAUUGAGCUTT-3′ and antisense
5′-AGCUCAAUCCGUUGUUCAGTT-3′ (Sigma, St
Louis, MO, USA).

against CXCR4 (1: 500; Abcam) and β-actin (1: 5,000;
Sigma) in 5% BSA (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS
(pH 7.4). After the membranes were washed, they were
incubated for 1 hour in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. After a washing, specific protein
bands were detected by using ECL Prime Western Blotting
Detection Reagents (Amersham Life Science, Arlington
Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and BM-HEp3 cells (9 × 104
cells/well) were seeded in 12-well or 24-well plates. After
24 hours, various cisplatin concentrations were added to
each well, the cells were incubated at 37°C for another
48 hours, and viable cells in each well were quantified
by using the Luna Automated Cell Counter (Logos
Biosystems). Cisplatin was kindly provided by Nippon
Kayaku (Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical Analysis

RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR

Student’s t test was used to evaluate differences
between two groups. Overall survival of mice was
calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and
was verified by means of the log-rank test. All analyses
were performed with JMP software Version 5.1 for
Windows (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical
significance was defined as P < .05.

Total RNA was isolated from P-HEp3, Lu-HEp3, and
BM-HEp3 cells by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Venlo, Netherlands) and was reverse transcribed to cDNA
by using the ExScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio Inc.,
Otsu, Japan), according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
The LightCycler System (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland) with SYBR Premix DimerEraser (Takara
Bio Inc.) was used to perform all PCR reactions. Primers
used for qRT-PCR were as follows: TGF-β1 forward:
5’-GTTCAAGCAGAGTACACACAGC-3’;
TGF-β1
reverse:
5’-GTATTTCTGGTACAGCTCCACG-3’;
