ABSTRACT
The mTORC1 inhibitors, rapamycin and its analogs, are known to show only
modest antitumor activity in clinic, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely
elusive. Here, we found that activated AKT signaling is associated with rapamycin
resistance in breast and colon cancers by sustained phosphorylation of the
translational repressor 4E-BP1. Treatment of tumor cells with rapamycin or the AKT
inhibitor MK2206 showed a limited activity in inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation,
cap-dependent translation, cell growth and motility. However, treatment with both
drugs resulted in profound effects in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigation
demonstrated that the combination treatment was required to effectively inhibit
PRAS40 phosphorylation on both Ser183 and Thr246 mediated by mTORC1 and AKT
respectively, and with the combined treatment, dephosphorylated PRAS40 binding to
the raptor/mTOR complex was enhanced, leading to dramatic repression of mTORC1regulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and translation. Knockdown of PRAS40 or 4EBP1 expression markedly reduced the dependence of tumor cells on AKT/mTORC1
signaling for translation and survival. Together, these findings reveal a critical role
of PRAS40 as an integrator of mTORC1 and AKT signaling for 4E-BP1-mediated
translational regulation of tumor cell growth and motility, and highlight PRAS40
phosphorylation as a potential biomarker to evaluate the therapeutic response to
mTOR/AKT inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

factors and nutrients [4]. mTOR exerts its biological
functions by the formation of two distinct protein
complexes: the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and the
mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is composed of
mTOR, raptor, mLST8, deptor and the proline-rich AKT
substrate of 40 kilodaltons (PRAS40). To date, protein
synthesis is the best-characterized process controlled
by mTORC1 [4]. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates the
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding
protein 1 (4E-BP1) on Thr37 and Thr46 which act as
priming sites for its subsequent phosphorylation on Ser65
and Thr70 [5]. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 prevents
its binding to the cap-binding protein eIF4E, which
allows eIF4E to participate in the assembly of the eIF4F
translation initiation complex, a rate-limiting step for the

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in a majority
of human cancers [1]. This pathway is activated by
mutations in genes that encode multiple components of
the pathway or upstream activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases [2]. Activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
has long been shown to be necessary for key features of
the transformed phenotype, suggesting that inhibition of
the pathway could be a useful therapeutic strategy [3].
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein
kinase is a major component of the PI3K/AKT pathway,
which controls cell growth, proliferation, survival and
metabolism by integrating a variety of signals from growth

cap-dependent mRNA translation and protein synthesis
[6]. We and others have shown that inhibition of mTORC1
downregulates a number of certain key oncogenic mRNAs
encoding proteins involved in cell-cycle progression, cell
survival, angiogenesis and metastasis [7-10], and that
dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 is an important biomarker for
predicting a response to AKT/mTOR inhibitors [9-14].
PRAS40, first reported as substrate for AKT
[15], is an inhibitory component of mTORC1 [16, 17].
Upon activation, mTORC1 can phosphorylate PRAS40
on Ser183 [18], which is in addition to the AKTphosphorylated PRAS40 on Thr246 [15]. Phosphorylation
of PRAS40 by AKT and mTORC1 results in disassociation
of PRAS40 from mTORC1 and relieves its inhibitory
constraint on mTORC1 activity [16-18]. Recent studies
have shown that increased phosphorylation of PRAS40 is
associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis
in patients [19-21].
Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) are allosteric
inhibitors of mTORC1 via their binding to FKBP12, and
were among the first mTOR-targeted therapeutics to enter
the clinic [22]. However, patients whose tumors harbor a
mutational activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, such as in
breast, colon and prostate cancer and glioblastoma, exhibit
a low response rate with rapalogs [22, 23]. It is widely
believed that this inadequate therapeutic response may
result from incomplete inhibition of mTORC1-mediated
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and a concomitant activation
of AKT via loss of a negative feedback mechanism [4,
22, 24, 25]. However, the molecular basis of incomplete
inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by rapamycin and
how activated AKT signaling contributes to rapalogs
resistance remain largely unknown.
In the present study, we demonstrate that the
redundant phosphorylation of PRAS40 by both AKT
and mTORC1 signaling is a novel mechanistic basis
for the acquired resistance to rapamycin in cancer cells.
Combined inhibition of AKT and mTORC1 is required
for effective inhibition of PRAS40 phosphorylation on
both Ser183 and Thr246 sites, which in turn increases
the ability of PRAS40 to inhibit mTORC1-mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylation and translation concomitant with
suppression of tumor growth and cell motility. Our data
uncover an important role of PRAS40 in the translational
control of tumor progression and therapeutic response to
mTORC1 inhibitors.

AKT inhibition profoundly enhances the
inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cap-dependent
translation by dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1
We and others have previously shown that the
phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 and its regulated capdependent translation activity are linked with cancer
progression and therapeutic responses in tumors such as in
breast and colon cancers with mutational activation of the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [9-13, 26-29]. To determine
whether the deregulated cap-dependent translation and
feedback activation of AKT contribute to rapamycin
resistance, we first examined the effects of rapamycin and
the AKT inhibitor MK2206, alone and in combination,
on 4E-BP1-regulated cap-dependent translation activity.
In a panel of breast (MCF7, BT474, MDA-MB-453) and
colon (HCT116) cancer cell lines, all with mutations in
the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3K p110α
(PIK3CA), rapamycin at 50 nM effectively inhibited
phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70S6 kinase
(p70S6K) and its downstream target S6 (Figure 1A).
Nonetheless, rapamycin induced feedback activation of
AKT, as indicated by phosphorylation on both Ser473
and Thr308 of AKT, and showed only weak inhibition
on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at its four mTORC1regulated phosphorylation sites (Thr37, Thr46, Ser65,
Thr70). MK2206 is a highly selective, allosteric inhibitor
of AKT1, 2, and 3 that inhibits the phosphorylation of
these kinases by preventing their association with the
membrane [26, 30]. Treatment with MK2206 at 1 µM
effectively inhibited AKT phosphorylation on both Ser473
and Thr308, but similar to rapamycin, had only a marginal
effect on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. However, MK2206
blunted the feedback activation of AKT by rapamycin and
profoundly blocked phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at all four
of its phosphorylation sites in the four PIK3CA mutant cell
lines (Figure 1A). Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 allows
it to bind to the eIF4E-mRNA cap complex and prevents
cap-dependent translation [6]. In MCF7 and HCT116
cells, treatment with either rapamycin or MK2206
slightly induced 4E-BP1 binding to the eIF4E-mRNA cap
complex. However, the combination of both drugs caused
marked recruitment of 4E-BP1 to the mRNA cap-complex
(Figure 1B). As a result, cap-dependent translation was
inhibited markedly by combination of rapamycin and
MK2206 compared with either agent alone in all the four
tested cancer cell lines (Figure 1C). These results suggest
that in tumor cells with mutational activation of PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway, combined inhibition of both AKT
and mTORC1 signaling is required to effectively inhibit
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which in turn, represses capdependent translation.

revealed a dramatic increase of G1 phase in the MCF7

in MCF7 and BT474, respectively) of apoptosis (Figure
2C and Supplementary Figure 1B). Western blot analysis
further showed that combination treatment with rapamycin
and MK2206 was more effective than either agent alone
in downregulating D-cyclin expression, activation of
caspase-3 and/or caspase-7, key effectors of apoptosis, and
increasing levels of cleaved PARP, a caspase substrate, in
BT474 and MDA-MB-453 cells (Figure 2D). Collectively,
these data demonstrate that AKT inhibition sensitizes
tumor cells to rapamycin by enhancing G1 arrest and
induction of apoptosis.

To determine whether 4E-BP1-regulated translation
is directly involved in the anti-proliferative and apoptotic
responses to combined inhibition of AKT and mTORC1
signaling, 4E-BP1 gene was knocked down in HCT116
and MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure 2) using a specific
shRNA target sequence as we have verified previously [9].
Combined treatment with rapamycin and MK2206 caused
a 35% and 40% inhibition of cap-dependent translation
in HCT116 and MCF7 control cells respectively, but had
much less effect in 4E-BP1 knockdown HCT116 (12%)
or MCF7 (22%) cells (Figure 2E). Furthermore, silencing

4E-BP1 expression in MCF7 and BT474 cells markedly
reversed the inhibitory effects of the combination on
G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis (Figure 2F, 2G and
Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).
Our recent studies show that 4E-BP1-regulated
cap-dependent translation also plays an important role
in controlling cancer cell motility and metastasis [9,
10]. Using Boyden chamber assays described previously
[9], treatment with rapamycin or MK2206 alone for 6
h had only a modest effect on MCF7 and HCT116 cell

migration. However, a combination of both drugs was
effective in inhibiting their migration (Figure 3A). Similar
results were observed in the ability of HCT116 cells that
invade through Matrigel 30 h after drug exposure (Figure
3B). Notably, knockdown of 4E-BP1 expression in
HCT116 cells profoundly reduced the inhibitory effect of
combined treatment on cell migration compared with that
in the control cells (Figure 3C).
Taken together, these data suggest that AKT and
mTORC1 signaling co-regulate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation,

with two different sets of shRNAs in MCF7 and HCT116
cells upregulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, p70S6K
and S6 (Figure 5A) and enhanced cap-dependent
translation activity (Figure 5B), suggesting that mTORC1
was activated by PRAS40 knockdown. Furthermore,
silencing PRAS40 expression in these two cell lines also
promoted cell growth (Figure 5C), and exhibited a twoto five-fold increase in cell migration and invasion as
compared with the control cells (Figure 5D, 5E and 5F). In
addition, BT474 cells with stable knockdown of PRAS40
expression provided similar results (Figure 5D, 5E).
Our data suggest that in cancer cells, AKT and
mTORC1 cooperate to maintain phosphorylation of
PRAS40, which in turn, relieves PRAS40-inhibitory
constraint on mTORC1 activity; the activated mTORC1
supports cap-dependent translation by phosphorylation of
4E-BP1 and promotes cell growth and motility. To confirm
this assertion, we examined the effects of AKT and
mTORC1 inhibitors, alone and in combination, in control
and PRAS40 knockdown MCF7 and HCT116 cells (Figure
6). Rapamycin alone effectively inhibited phosphorylation
of p70S6K and S6 in both control and PRAS40
knockdown cells (Figure 6A). In contrast, treatment with
the combination of rapamycin and MK2206 was required
for effective inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and
cap-dependent translation in control cells (Figure 6A, 6B).
However, knockdown of PRAS40 expression markedly
reversed the inhibitory effects seen with the combination
treatment. Similar to findings obtained with knockdown of
4E-BP1 expression (Figures 2 and 3), silencing PRAS40
expression abrogated G1 arrest, induction of apoptosis
and inhibition of cell migration induced by combined
treatment with rapamycin and MK2206 when compared
with results obtained in control cells (Figure 6C, 6D
and 6E). Collectively, these data indicate that PRAS40
integrates the effects of AKT and mTORC1 activation
on 4E-BP1-mediated translational regulation of cell
proliferation, survival and motility.

Phosphorylation of PRAS40 is a key effector of
translational activation by AKT and mTORC1
signaling for cell proliferation, survival and
motility
PRAS40 is a negative regulator of mTORC1
activity by competing with p70S6K and 4E-BP1 for
binding to raptor [16, 18]. However, post-translational
phosphorylation can inhibit the PRAS40 activity. AKT
phosphorylates PRAS40 on Thr246 [15], whereas
mTORC1 phosphorylates PRAS40 on Ser183 [18]. When
phosphorylated, PRAS40 binding to raptor is reduced, so
its ability to inhibit mTORC1 is affected as well [16, 18]. In
a panel of cancer cell lines, shown in Figure 1A, inhibition
of AKT with MK2206 clearly inhibited phosphorylation
of PRAS40 at Thr246, whereas inhibition of mTORC1
with rapamycin did not affect the Thr246 phosphorylation
(Figure 4A). However, this phosphorylation showed more
inhibition with rapamycin in combination with MK2206
than with MK2206 alone. Similarly, combined treatment
with rapamycin and MK2206 was required to inhibit
phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Ser183 in a significant
manner, whereas inhibition with either agent alone caused
only modest or no effect. As such, the combination of
rapamycin and MK2206 induced a greater level PRAS40
binding to raptor than did either agent alone in HCT116
cells (Figure 4B).
To establish that effective inhibition of PRAS40
activity requires both mTORC1 and AKT signaling
for PRAS40 phosphorylation, we generated PRAS40
phosphorylation-mimicking mutants in which Ser183
and/or Thr246 phosphorylation sites were replaced
with aspartic acids. We transfected wild-type PRAS40,
the PRAS40 mutants S183D and T246D, or the double
mutants S183D/T246D into MCF7 and HCT116 cells
(Figure 4C, 4D). As compared to wild-type PRAS40, the
S183D mutant exhibited a marked reduction in its ability
to bind to raptor and mTOR, whereas the binding with the
T246D mutant resembled that of the wild type. However,
the greatest reduction in PRAS40 bound to the raptor/
mTOR complex occurred with the double mutant (Figure
4C). In addition, the degree of PRAS40 mutant binding to
the raptor/mTOR complex correlated with the extent of
inhibition of cap-dependent translation (Figure 4D). The
double mutant significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect
on cap-dependent translation more than that induced by
either S183D or T246D.

AKT inhibition enhances the antitumor activity of

The profound anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects
of the combination of AKT and mTORC1 inhibitors
in vitro suggest that targeting both AKT and mTORC1
signaling may be a rational strategy for the treatment of
tumors with PIK3CA mutation. To explore the feasibility
of this therapeutic strategy, we tested the safety and
efficacy of inhibiting mTORC1 and AKT in PIK3CA
mutant MCF7 tumor xenografts in vivo. As we and others
have previously shown, the AKT inhibitor MK2206 at 100
mg/kg and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin at 4 mg/kg
effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT and S6,
respectively, in PIK3CA or PTEN mutant xenografts [26,

were treated with rapamycin (5 times/week at 4 mg/kg),
MK2206 (3 times/week at 100 mg/kg), a combination of
both drugs, or vehicle control for 3 weeks. Administration
of rapamycin or MK2206 alone slowed growth of tumors,
but they still grew significantly. In contrast, treatment
with both drugs led to a complete suppression of tumor
growth, along with modest tumor regression (Figure 7A,
7B). In addition, chronic administration of both drugs at
the indicated dose and schedule was well tolerated with
no weight loss in the animals (Supplementary Figure
4). Western blot analysis of tumor extracts revealed that
rapamycin potently repressed phosphorylation of p70S6K
and S6, but induced feedback activation of AKT (Figure
7C). MK2206 effectively inhibited AKT phosphorylation,
but had no effect on the levels of phosphorylation of

p70S6K and S6 (Figure 7C), which was different from
what we observed in vitro (Figure 1A). The reason for
this inconsistency is not clear but may be due to mTOR
activation independent of AKT by 17β-estradiol [33]
that was used for the maintenance of estrogen-dependent
MCF7 xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Nevertheless,
neither rapamycin nor MK2206 alone inhibited
phosphorylation of PRAS40 and 4E-BP1 effectively, and
neither drug alone induced significant PARP cleavage. In
contrast, treatment with both drugs resulted in a dramatic
inhibition of PRAS40 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and
increase in PARP cleavage. These data highlight the
effectiveness of concomitant inhibition of mTORC1 and
AKT.

DISCUSSION

signaling plays a crucial role in maintaining a transformed
phenotype through 4E-BP1-regulated translation. This
concept is supported by the following findings: (i)
inhibition of either mTORC1 by rapamycin or AKT by
MK2206 is insufficient to inhibit phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and cap-dependent translation (Figure 1), which
is associated with incomplete inhibition of PRAS40
phosphorylation on both Ser183 and Thr246 sites (Figure
4); (ii) inhibition of both mTORC1 and AKT is required
for effective dephosphorylation of PRAS40 at these
two sites, thereby enhancing the ability of PRAS40 to
inhibit mTORC1-mediated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and
cap-dependent translation concomitant with profound
suppression of cell proliferation, survival and motility as
well as tumor growth; and (iii) knockdown of PRAS40

A number of studies have shown that rapamycin
and rapalogs induce feedback activation of AKT and
the combination of rapamycin (or rapalogs) and AKT
inhibitors results in additive or synergistic antitumor
effects [34-38]. However, the molecular mechanism
underlying the biological significance of the crosstalk
between mTORC1 and AKT signaling during malignant
transformation and therapeutic response to AKT/mTOR
inhibitors has remained largely undetermined. In this
study, we provide evidence to demonstrate that the
convergent phosphorylation of PRAS40 (or inhibition
of PRAS40 function) by activated AKT and mTORC1

or 4E-BP1 markedly rescues these inhibitory effects
induced by combined inhibition of mTORC1 and AKT.
Our findings reveal a novel PRAS40/4E-BP1 axis at the
crossroads of AKT and mTORC1 signaling and present
a potential avenue for therapeutic control of cancer
progression (Figure 7D).
The p70S6K is another well-known substrate of
mTORC1. Although p70S6K and its substrate ribosomal
protein S6 are also known as regulators of mRNA
biogenesis and translation, a growing body of evidence,
including our studies, indicate that the deregulation of capdependent translation downstream of mTORC1 at the level
of 4E-BP1/eIF4E plays a central role in tumor formation
and metastatic progression; the contribution of p70S6K1
and S6 to the oncogenic action of the mTORC1 upstream
activators, AKT and/or extracellular signal-regulated
kinase, appears limited [12, 27, 39, 40]. Consistent with
previous studies [11, 12, 27, 39, 41], our findings support
the notion that the phosphorylation status of S6 may not
be a relevant biomarker to predict treatment efficacy for
mTORC1 inhibitors, because loss of S6 phosphorylation
by rapamycin does not always correlate with inhibition
of all mTORC1 substrates such as 4E-BP1 and PRAS40.
It remains largely unknown why mTORC1
substrates show differential sensitivities to rapamycin
in cancer cells. The molecular nature of rapamycin as
an mTORC1 inhibitor differs from the ATP-competitive
kinase inhibitors in that it forms a complex with FKBP12
and inhibits the ability of mTORC1 to phosphorylate
its substrates through an unknown mechanism [22]. A
recent report by Kang et al. suggests that the sequence
composition of an mTORC1 phosphorylation site is one
of the key determinants of whether the site is good or poor
mTORC1 substrate within cells [42]. In this report, they
found that mTORC1 could strongly phosphorylate 4E-BP1
on both Thr37 and Thr46 sites, so that even the reduced
activity of rapamycin-bound mTORC1 would be sufficient
to keep them phosphorylated. In other words, inhibition of
mTORC1 activity by rapamycin is insufficient to inhibit
4E-BP1 phosphorylation, thereby resulting in it resistance
to rapamycin. In contrast, they showed that mTORC1
weakly phosphorylates p70S6K on Thr389, which is
rapamycin sensitive as the reduction of mTORC1 activity
by rapamycin is sufficient to inhibit its phosphorylation.
These findings suggest that maximal inhibition of
mTORC1 activity is required for effective suppression
of phosphorylation of rapamycin-resistant mTORC1
substrates. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of AKT
activity markedly enhances the ability of rapamycin to
inhibit phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 both in vitro and in
vivo. Our data suggest that AKT inhibition can reverse
rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 substrates being sensitive
to rapamycin. Mechanistically, we found that this reversal
is likely due to a more complete dephosphorylation of
PRAS40, which leads to an increase in the formation
of PRAS40-raptor complex by enhancing inhibition of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTORC1 activity for phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. We
demonstrated that a combination of AKT and mTORC1
inhibitors is required to effectively inhibit phosphorylation
of PRAS40 on both Ser183 and Thr246 sites and increases
PRAS40 binding to raptor (Figure 4A, 4B). Conversely,
phosphorylation of both Ser183 and Thr246 is required
to reduce PRAS40 binding to raptor/mTOR complex and
attenuate the inhibitory effect of PRAS40 on mTORC1/4EBP1-mediated cap-dependent translation (Figure 4C, 4D).
In addition, given that PRAS40 competes with p70S6K
and 4E-BP1 for binding to raptor and inhibiting mTORC1
activity on its substrates [16, 18], the alterations in the
molecular interaction among p70S6K, 4E-BP1, PRAS40,
raptor, mTOR and rapamycin may yield scenarios where
the ability of the substrate binding to raptor/mTOR and the
sensitivity to rapamycin-induced disassociation may differ.
Whether the increase of PRAS40 bound to raptor by the
combination of rapamycin and AKT inhibition is required
for the dissociation of 4E-BP1 rather than p70S6K from
raptor remains to be determined.
It is important to note that prolonged treatment with
rapamycin has been shown to inhibit AKT via disruption
of mTORC2 assembly in certain cell lines [43], but in
many other cell types including preclinical and clinical
specimens in our present and prior studies as well as others
reports, chronic administration of rapamycin could induce
substantial activation of AKT signaling [22, 24, 25, 34-38,
43, 44]. In addition to the PIK3CA mutant tumor cells as
we tested in this study, we and others also observed that in
KRAS mutant and wild-type colon and lung cancer cells,
rapamycin could also elicit AKT activation and increase
the level of AKT-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40
on Thr246 (Supplementary Figure 5) [38]. Moreover,
combined inhibition of AKT and mTORC1 is also required
to effectively inhibit phosphorylation of both PRAS40 and
4E-BP1 and cell growth in these cells (Supplementary
Figure 5) [38]. These data suggest that co-targeting AKT
and mTORC1 signaling may be a useful therapeutic
strategy for many malignancies. However, a detailed
analysis of different tumors with specific genotypes is
needed to determine the role of PRAS40/mTORC1/4EBP1 axis in the effectiveness and therapeutic index of this
approach.
The implications of our findings suggest that the
ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors (mTORKIs) that
inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 may provide better
therapeutic outcomes when compared with rapamycin in
the clinic. mTORC2 directly phosphorylates AKT at its
hydrophobic motif (Ser473), which enhances the catalytic
activity of AKT already phosphorylated on Thr308 [45].
In contrast to rapamycin-induced feedback activation
of AKT with limited inhibitory activity on 4E-BP1
phosphorylation, the mTORKIs can effectively inhibit
AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 and show much greater
repression on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation [46, 47]. However,
a recent report by Rodrik-Outmezguine et al. showed that
13972

MATERIALS AND METHODS

phosphorylation of AKT at the Thr308 site and of the AKT
substrates including PRAS40, GSK-3β and FOXO1/3
are only transiently repressed by mTORKIs in PIK3CA
mutant (MCF7, BT474) and PTEN-deficient (MDAMB-468) breast cancer cell lines [48]. Moreover, the
mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Thr37/
Thr46 also rebounded between 8 and 24 h after treatment
with mTORKIs such as AZD8055 and PP242. They
found that inhibition of mTOR kinase relieves feedback
inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, which causes
subsequent activation of PI3K and re-phosphorylation
of AKT on Thr308 sufficient to reactivate AKT activity
and signaling, whereas combination of mTORKIs and
AKT inhibitors demonstrates a more stable inhibition
of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation than mTORKIs alone and
dramatically induces apoptosis [48]. Consistent with
these findings, our recent study also showed that although
knockdown of raptor expression markedly inhibits 4EBP1 phosphorylation, inhibition of AKT activity could
further attenuate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation associated with
significant antitumor effects in raptor-knockdown colon
cancer cells [9]. Furthermore, additional experimental
evidence has highlighted that incomplete inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation is a mechanism of primary resistance
to mTORKIs [13, 49]. These studies identified that
KRAS-mutant SW620 colon cancer cells are particularly
resistant to PP242, and PP242 cannot effectively inhibit
4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, we found that AKT
inhibition by MK2206 in combination with PP242 could
elicit more profound inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
compared to the responses to PP242 alone (Supplementary
Figure 6). Taken together, these data suggest that AKT
kinase may be involved in the regulation of 4E-BP1
phosphorylation and translation in mTORC1-depedent
and -independent manners, and that combined inhibition
of mTOR and PI3K/AKT may be a promising therapeutic
strategy for many malignancies. Indeed, dual inhibition
of PI3K and mTORC1/2 signaling by NVP-BEZ235 or
rapalogs in combination with PI3K or AKT inhibitors has
demonstrated profound efficacy in a variety of preclinical
models of cancers [34-37, 50-56].
In summary, our study provides new insight into
the biologic and therapeutic relevance of PRAS40 in
translational regulation of tumor cell proliferation,
survival and motility. Our findings reveal that regulation
of PRAS40 activity through cooperative AKT and
mTORC1 phosphorylation of both Ser183 and Thr246
is a key process to alter the mTORC1 substrate (e.g. 4EBP1) specificity. In addition to the phosphorylation of
4E-BP1, PRAS40 phosphorylation may also serve as a
surrogate marker to evaluate the response to the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors in clinic. These findings
could have high translational significance and enhance our
understanding of the involvement of PRAS40 and 4E-BP1
in the regulation of cancer progression and therapeutics.

Cell culture, inhibitors, constructs, and lentiviral
shRNA silencing
Human breast and colon cancer cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in the appropriate
medium with supplements as suggested by ATCC.
Rapamycin and MK2206 were obtained from LC
Laboratories (Woburn, MA) and Selleck (Houston, TX),
respectively. The PRK5-PRAS40 construct was from
Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The PRAS40 cDNA was
amplified by PCR using PRK5-PRAS40 as a template and
the product subcloned into the Sgf I and Mlu I sites of
pCMV6-Myc-Flag (Origene, Rockville, MD). The insert
was mutated using a QuikChange XLII mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). Mutants with Asp at
Ser183 (S183D), Thr246 (T246D) and both Ser183 and
Thr246 (S183D/T246D) were generated in pCMV6-MycFlag. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Lentiviral shRNAs to human 4E-BP1 were from Open
Biosystems (Lafayette, CO) and the specificity of the
targeting sequences has been verified in our previous
study [9]. Lentiviral shRNAs to human PRAS40 and the
Non-Target Control shRNA (SHC002) were from Sigma
(St Louis, MO). The accession numbers of PRAS40
ShRNA_1 and PRAS40 ShRNA_2 are TRCN0000158835
and TRCN00001666394, respectively. For establishing
stable transfectants with knockdown of specific protein
expression, cell lines were lentivirally infected with the
indicated shRNA construct followed by selection with
puromycin (2 µg/ml) for one week as described previously
[9].

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the
number of viable cells in response to the treatment with
the indicated drugs as described previously [9].

Cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis assay
Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes, grown
overnight, and treated as indicated in figure legends. Both
adherent and floating cells were harvested. For cell-cycle
analysis, cell nuclei were prepared by the method of Nusse
[57] and stained with ethidium bromide as described [26].
Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry.
For apoptosis, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA).

internal control. The renilla/firefly luciferase luminescence
ratio was calculated for cap-dependent translational
activity.

Migration and invasion assays were performed
in Boyden chambers with coated collagen or Matrigel,
respectively, as instructed by the manufacturer (BD
Biosciences) and described previously [9].

Animal studies
Female athymic nude mice (5-6 weeks old) were
purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY). Experiments
were carried out under a protocol approved by the
University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. MCF7 xenograft tumors were established
by subcutaneously implanting 0.72 mg sustained release
17β-estradiol pellets into one flank at least 3 days before
injecting 5 × 106 cells suspended 1:1 (volume) with growth
factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) on the opposite
side. For efficacy studies, mice were randomized among
control and treated groups (n = 5 per group) when tumors
were well-established (~150-180 mm3). Rapamycin was
prepared in absolute ethanol at 10 mg/ml and diluted
in 5% Tween-80 and 5% PEG-400 before injection.
Rapamycin was administered by intraperitoneal injection
at 4 mg/kg once per day, Mon-Fri as previously reported
[32]. MK2206 was formulated in 30% captisol and given
orally at 100 mg/kg once per day, Mon-Wed-Fri based
on previous reports [31]. Control mice received a vehicle
solution. Tumor dimensions were measured using a caliper
and tumor volumes were calculated as mm3 = π/6 x larger
diameter x (smaller diameter)2. Tumors were excised and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in 2% SDS
lysis buffer and then processed for Western blot analysis
as described previously [9, 12].

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer, and analyzed
by Western blot using equal total protein loading as
described previously [12]. Phosphorylation-specific
antibodies and antibodies for PRAS40, 4E-BP1, eIF4E,
raptor, Myc tag, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3 and
caspase-7 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA). mTOR antibody (H-266) was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX) and β-actin antibody was
from Sigma.

Immunoprecipitation
PRAS40 complexes were immunoprecipitated
with PRAS40 antibody (Clone 73P21, EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA) or anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) according to
the procedure described by Sancak et al [16]. At the end,
the immunoprecipitates from 0.5 to 1 mg protein of cell
lysates captured with protein G Sepharose were analyzed
by Western blot.

Cap-binding assay

Statistical analysis

Cell lysates as prepared above were incubated with
m7GTP Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences,
Pittsburgh, PA) to capture eIF4E and its binding partners.
Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and
resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by
Western blot analysis.

All experiments were performed at least twice.
Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. where applicable.
A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare the
intergroup. Differences between groups were considered
statistically significant at P < 0.05.
