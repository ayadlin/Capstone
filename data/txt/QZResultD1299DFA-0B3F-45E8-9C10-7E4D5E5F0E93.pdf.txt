ABSTRACT
The survival rate of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) patients
has not considerably changed over the last two decades. Polyphenols inhibit the
growth of cancer cells. We determined whether the combination of Resveratrol (RES)
and Curcumin (CUR) enhanced their in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities on HNSCC
cell lines compared to the single compounds. We provide evidence that RES potentiated
the apoptotic effect and reduced the IC50 of CUR on HNSCC cell lines. The model of
compounds interaction indicated the onset of an additive effect of the two compounds
compared to the single treatment after decrease of their concentrations. RES+CUR
compared to CUR increased the PARP-1 cleavage, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the inhibition
of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation, and the expression of LC3 II simultaneously
with the formation of autophagic vacuoles. RES and CUR induced cytoplasmic NF-κB
accumulation. RES+CUR administrations were safe in BALB/c mice and reduced the
growth of transplanted salivary gland cancer cells (SALTO) more efficiently than CUR.
Overall, combinations of CUR and RES was more effective in inhibiting in vivo and in
vitro cancer growth than the treatment with CUR. Additional studies will be needed
to define the therapeutic potential of these compounds in combination.

INTRODUCTION

through simultaneous direct interaction or modulation of
gene expression [4, 5].
Curcumin (CUR) and Resveratrol (RES) are nonflavonoid polyphenols [3, 6]. CUR [l,7-bis-(4-hydroxy3-methoxyphenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione], found in
the spice turmeric, a product of the plant Curcuma longa,
has been widely employed for centuries in Asia as a food
additive as well as in cosmetic and herbal medicine. CUR
is a pleiotropic molecule able to interact with a variety of
molecular targets and signal transduction pathways and
has been revealed to have antitumor, anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial
activities in both rodents and humans [7-11]. Due to its

The rate of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs) is increasing worldwide, and despite advances
in treatment, the survival rate of HNSCC patients has not
considerably changed over the last two decades [1]. The
development of HNSCC is multistep, progressing from
precancerous lesions to malignant tumors [2].
Polyphenols constitute one of the most numerous
and widely distributed groups of natural products in the
plant kingdom [3]. Polyphenols can be employed to inhibit
the growth of cancer cells due to their ability to modulate
the activity of multiple targets involved in carcinogenesis

ability to modulate the activity of multiple targets involved
in carcinogenesis through direct interaction or modulation
of gene expression, CUR is considered a “multifunctional
drug” [7, 9-11]. However, CUR has poor absorption,
biodistribution, metabolism, and bioavailability, which
might hinder the in vivo effects of the compound [7].
Indeed, in a phase I clinical trial for patients with advanced
colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies,
the oral administration of 3.6 g of curcumin daily produced
a plasma CUR level in the 10 nmol/L range after 1 hour
[12]. RES (3,4’,5-trihydroxy-transstilbene), a polyphenol
compound isolated from grapes, berries, plums, peanuts
and pines, has several biological properties, including
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antiaging activities [13-15]. Similar to CUR, RES may have
partial biological activity due to poor absorption and
first-pass metabolism [16, 17]. It has been reported that
RES and CUR inhibit the growth of HNSCC cell lines
when employed as single drugs [18-25]. Overall, the poor
bioavailability of CUR and RES will affect the effective
dose delivered to cancer cells. One way to counteract
this drawback could be combination treatment with CUR

plus RES, which can lead to more effective anti-tumoral
effects than treatment using only one of the compounds.
We previously demonstrated that RES enhanced CURinduced sarcoma cell apoptosis [26].
The aim of this study was to determine whether the
combination of RES and CUR resulted in an enhancement
of their in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities on HNSCC
cell lines compared to the single compounds. In addition,
we explored the effect of these compounds and their
interaction with signal transduction pathways involved in
apoptosis and the growth of cancer cells.

RESULTS
Inhibition of human HNSCC cell survival by RES
and CUR alone or in combination
The survival of tongue (CAL-27 and SCC-15) and
pharynx (FaDu) cancer cells was evaluated by the SRB
assay after exposure to increasing doses of RES and CUR

Figure 1: Effect of RES and CUR alone or in combination on HNSCC cell survival. Panel A: Survival of tongue (CAL-27

and SCC-15) and pharynx (FaDu) cancer cells was assessed by the SRB assay after 48 hours of treatment with DMSO, RES or CUR alone
or in equimolar combinations of the two compounds (RES+CUR). The results are reported as the mean ± SD values from three experiments
performed in triplicate. #: p<0.001; §: p<0.01; *: p<0.05 vs cultures treated with DMSO. Panel B: Interaction between RES and CUR on

alone or in combination (RES+CUR) or vehicle control
(DMSO) for 48 hours. The effects of CUR and RES were
dose-dependent and achieved statistical significance at
all doses tested compared to vehicle control treatment
(Figure 1, Panel A). However, CUR was the most
effective compound in inhibiting cell survival. The effect
obtained with equimolar combinations of RES+CUR was
significantly higher than the effect of treatment with RES
at all concentrations on CAL-27 (p<0.001), SCC-15 and
FaDu cells (p<0.001 at 50-25-12.5 µM; p<0.01 at 6.25 µM
for both cell lines) or CUR alone at 12.5-6.25 µM (CAL27 and FaDu, p<0.05) or at 6.25 µM (SCC-15) (p<0.05)
(Figure 1, Panel A).
The model of interaction between CUR and RES
when used in combination was determined using the
method of Kern (Figure 1, Panel B). Interaction between
RES+CUR at the concentration of 50 µM indicates an R
index of 0.38, 0.32 and 0.49 after treatment of CAL-27,

SCC-15 and FADU cells, respectively, which indicates
a less than additive effect. However, R increases in all
cell lines when the concentrations of the compounds
decreased, which indicates the onset of an additive effect
of the two compounds with respect to the associated single
treatment after decrease of their concentrations (Figure 1,
Panel B).
The concentration of compounds that inhibits 50%
of cell growth (IC50) was also determined. RES+CUR
significantly reduced the IC50 compared to treatment with
the single CUR treatment in FADU cells (Figure 1, Panel
C).

human HNSCC lines

in combination on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution

ImageJ software after blot scanning, and the densitometric ratios between the cleaved and the full length PARP-1 are reported. Panel B:

treatment, cells were fixed and incubated with anti-p53 antibody. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary
Alexa fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Original magnification x400. Panel C:
CAL-27 cells were treated with compounds, and the expression of procaspases (9-8) and caspases (8-3) was analyzed with Western blotting.
The intensities of the bands obtained in two independent experiments were quantified using ImageJ software after blot scanning, and the
densitometric ratios between procaspase 9 and actin are reported.

Percentage of cells in the sub-G1, G0/G1, S and G2/M phase were calculated using Cell Quest software. The data are
representative of three experiments. RES and CUR were used in the range 6.25-25 μM. Statistical significance of the effects
obtained with combined treatment was calculated vs. those obtained with the more potent single compound (1RES+CUR 6.25
μM vs CUR 6.25 μM; 2RES+CUR 12.5 μM vs CUR 12.5 μM; 3RES+CUR 25 μM vs CUR and vs RES 25 μM).

of HNSCC cells, a FACS analysis of DNA content was
performed. The effects of the compounds were compared
to each other and to DMSO (Table 1). RES resulted in a
dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of G0/G1 cells
(CAL-27: p<0.001 at 25 and 12.5 µM; SCC15: p<0.001 at
25 µM and p<0.01 at 12.5 µM; FaDu: p<0.001 at 25-6.25
µM) and an increased percentage of S phase cells (CAL27 and SCC15: p<0.05 at 25 µM; FaDu: p<0.01 at 12.5
and 6.25 µM). RES did not change the apoptotic sub-G1
population. Conversely, CUR resulted in a marked, dose
dependent increase of the percentage cells in the sub-G1
phase (CAL-27: p<0.001 at 25 µM; SCC15: p<0.001 at 25
and 12.5 µM; FaDu: p<0.05 at 25 µM) and in a decrease in
the number of G0/G1 cells (CAL-27: p<0.001 at 25 µM;
SCC15: p<0.01 at 25 and 12.5 µM; FaDu: p<0.001 at 25
and 12.5 µM and p<0.01 at 6.25 µM). As for the effects of
the combined treatment, RES+CUR induced a significant,
dose-dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic,
sub-G1 cells in all cell lines compared to either compound
alone at a higher dose (Table 1). From the comparison of
the apoptotic rates obtained with the RES+CUR treatment
and the data obtained with CUR alone, it emerged that in
CAL-27 cells, the combined treatment allowed a reduction
of the dose of CUR required to achieve an apoptotic rate
of 28% by 1.8 times. Similarly, the dose of CUR required
to achieve an apoptotic rate of 58% and 25% could be
reduced by 1.94 and 2.77 times through the combination
of CUR and RES in SCC-15 and FaDu cells, respectively.
To corroborate that the effect of compounds on
the increase of cells in sub-G1 was due to the induction
of apoptosis, the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was analyzed by Western blotting
in CAL-27 and FaDu cell lines treated with 25 µM RES,
CUR, RES+CUR or DMSO for 24 hours (Figure 2, Panel
A). CUR treatment resulted in considerable PARP-1
proteolytic cleavage (CAL-27: p<0.01 vs control or RES;
FaDu: p<0.001 vs control and p<0.01 vs RES) (Figure
2, Panel A). Moreover, RES+CUR treatment increased
PARP-1 proteolytic cleavage compared to CUR treatment
in both cell lines (CAL-27: p<0.05; FaDu: p<0.01).
To further analyze the activation of apoptosis,
treated CAL-27 and FaDu cells were analyzed for the
expression of Bax and Bcl-2 with Western blotting. CUR
treatment increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in cell lines
compared to DMSO treatment (p<0.01) (Figure 2, Panel
B). It is of note that the decreased ratio is mainly due to
Bcl-2 down-regulation. RES+CUR treatment was more
effective in increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio than the CUR
treatment (CAL-27: p<0.01; FaDu: p<0.05) (Figure 2,
Panel B).
Next, p53 expression was analyzed. Two p53
products were detected in both DMSO- and RES-treated
cells. The presence of a truncated p53 protein in FaDu
cells was previously reported [27]. Although RES did not
affect p53 expression, CUR and RES+CUR reduced the
expression of the higher molecular weight p53 protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

compared to DMSO (CAL-27: p<0.05; FaDu: p<0.001).
The lower molecular p53 protein was not detected after
CUR and RES+CUR treatments (Figure 2, Panel B). In
addition, nuclear p53 expression was down-regulated in
CUR- and RES+CUR-treated cells compared to DMSOtreated cells (Figure 2, Panel B).
The expression of procaspases (9-8) and caspases
(8-3) was analyzed with Western blotting in CAL-27 cells
to determine which apoptotic pathway was activated after
treatments. CUR reduced the level of procaspase 9 and
8 compared to DMSO (p<0.001), thus indicating their
activation [28] (Figure 2, Panel C). In addition, procaspase
8 and 3 were cleaved after CUR treatment. RES did not
activate caspases. RES+CUR activated caspases similarly
to CUR (Figure 2, Panel C).

Effect of RES and CUR alone or in combination
on pro-survival signaling proteins
The effect of the compounds on ERK
phosphorylation (p-ERK) in unstimulated CAL-27 and
FaDu cells was then investigated. RES and CUR reduced
p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 levels in CAL-27 cells (p-ERK1:
p<0.001; p-ERK2: p<0.01). When administered alone,
neither RES nor CUR had notable effects on p-ERK levels
in FaDu cells. However, RES potentiated the inhibition of
p-ERK1 by CUR in both cell lines (p<0.01). In addition,
RES+CUR further reduced p-ERK2 compared to RES or
CUR in both cell lines (p<0.05) (Figure 3, panel A).
NF-κB is implicated in the survival and invasiveness
of HNSCC cells, and different chemotherapeutic
compounds inhibit NF-κB activation [29-31]. The
activation of NK-κB leads to its translocation from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus. To determine whether RES,
CUR and RES+CUR treatments were able to interfere with
NK-κB nuclear translocation, CAL-27 and FADU cells
were treated with compounds alone or in combination at
a concentration of 25 µM for 24 hours. NF-κB was found
to be mainly localized in the nuclei in DMSO-treated
cells (Figure 3, Panel B). Conversely, RES and CUR
alone or in combination induced NF-κB accumulation
in the cytoplasm in both cell lines (Figure 3, Panel B).
In addition, Western blotting analysis demonstrated the
appearance of an extra, lower molecular weight product
of NF-κB in CUR- and RES+CUR-treated cells but not
in DMSO and RES-treated cells. This smaller molecular
protein may represent an NF-κB degradation product
(Figure 3, Panel B). The effect of the compounds on
AKT phosphorylation in unstimulated CAL-27 and FaDu
cells was then investigated (Figure 3, Panel C). RES
alone significantly potentiated AKT phosphorylation in
CAL-27 and FaDu cell lines compared to DMSO treated
cells (p<0.05). Conversely, CUR decreased the level
of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) both in CAL-27 and
FaDu cells (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively). However,

FaDu cells compared to DMSO (p<0.05).

compared to DMSO. LC3 II expression was then analyzed
after 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours of treatment. LC3 II was
more highly expressed in cells treated with RES+CUR
compared to those treated with CUR after 12 and 24 hours
of treatment (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). REStreated cells showed a high expression of LC3 II only after
48 hours of treatment (Figure 4, panel A).
Induction of autophagy was confirmed using
transmission electron microscopy [33]. Cells were treated
with different compounds at the concentration of 12.5
µM for 24 hours. No difference was found between RESor DMSO-treated cells (Figure 4, Panel B). Conversely,
CUR-treated cells showed the presence of cytoplasmatic
autophagic vacuoles surrounded by double membrane and
containing organelles such as mitochondria. Apoptotic
cells were also revealed after CUR treatment. Notably, the
morphological features of apoptosis and autophagy were
simultaneously observed in the same cells. RES+CURtreated cells were similar to CUR-treated cells. In
addition, combined treatment more actively stimulated the

Induction of autophagy in HNSCC cells after
treatment with RES, CUR, or RES + CUR
To determine the effect of the treatments in
inducing autophagy in HNSCC cells, the expression
pattern of the autophagosomal marker microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) was analyzed with
Western blotting (Figure 4, Panel A). During autophagy,
ProLC3 is processed to its LC3 I cytosolic form, which
is subsequently modified to a membrane-bound form
(LC3 II) that localizes to pre-autophagosomes and
autophagosomes, making this protein an autophagosomal
marker [32]. LC3 I and LC3 II expression increased
after 30 hours of CUR or RES+CUR treatments at the
concentration of 12.5 µM compared to DMSO (Figure
4, Panel A). RES induced a slight increase of LC3 II

combined treatment allowed a reduction in the dose of
CUR required to achieve an apoptotic rate of 49.5% by

RES and CUR increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in
SALTO cells compared to DMSO (p<0.01) (Figure
5, Panel D). CUR but not RES induced PARP-1 and
procaspase-3 proteolytic cleavage. However, RES+CUR
increased procaspase-3 cleavage compared to CUR
(Figure 5, Panel D).

RES potentiates the apoptotic effect of CUR on
SALTO mouse salivary gland cancer cells

Delay of tumor growth in vivo by treatment with
RES and CUR alone or in combination

Survival of SALTO cancer cells was evaluated
by the SRB assay after exposure to compounds for 48
hours. The effects of CUR and RES were dose-dependent.
RES gained statistical significance at 50 μM compared
to the vehicle control treatment (p<0.001). Conversely,
CUR treatment was effective at 50-12.5 μM (p<0.001).
In addition, the effect obtained on SALTO cells with
equimolar combinations of RES+CUR was significant
compared to treatment with either RES or CUR alone at
concentrations of 50-6.25 µM (p<0.001) and 12.5-6.25
µM (p<0.01), respectively (Figure 5, Panel A).
The interaction between RES+CUR at the
concentration of 50 µM produced an R index of 0.88,
which indicates that at that concentration, the effect of the
association of the two compounds was less than additive.
Although R was 1.1, 1.35 and 1.24 at the concentrations
of 25, 12.5 and 6.25 µM, respectively, this value was not
significantly different compared to R=1, which confirms
the additive effect of the compounds (Figure 5, Panel B).
The IC50 values of CUR or RES+CUR were 29.05
and 15.52, respectively. Thus, the combination treatment
of RES + CUR significantly reduces IC50 compared to
treatment with CUR alone (p<0.01).
The effects of the compounds alone or in
combination on apoptosis and the cell cycle distribution
of SALTO cells were also determined (Figure 5, Panel
C). RES resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the
percentage of G0/G1 cells (p<0.05 vs DMSO at 25 µM)
and in an increased percentage of G2/M phase cells
(p<0.01 vs DMSO at 25 µM). RES did not change the
apoptotic sub-G1 population. Conversely, CUR resulted
in a dose dependent increase of the percentage cells in
the sub-G1 phase (p<0.01 vs DMSO at 25 µM) and a
decrease in the number of G0/G1 cells (p<0.01 vs DMSO
at 25 µM). As for the effects of combined treatments,
RES+CUR induced a dose-dependent increase in the
percentage of apoptotic, sub-G1 cells and a dosedependent decrease in the percentage of G0/G1 and G2/M
cells compared to either compound administered alone at
the higher dose (Figure 5, Panel C). From the comparison
of the apoptotic rates obtained with the RES+CUR and

To evaluate whether the administration of RES
and CUR alone or in combination was able to inhibit
the growth of transplanted SALTO cells, groups of
BALB/c mice were treated with RES and CUR alone or
in combination prior to or simultaneously with tumor cell
implantation [34]. Corn oil, used as vehicle, and water
were used as negative controls.
Four weeks following the challenge, CUR and
RES+CUR each induced a more efficient tumor mean
volume decrease than RES when treatment was started
before the tumor challenge (90 mm3 and 80 mm3 vs 1148
mm3, respectively) (p<0.0001). All water-, corn oil- and
RES-treated mice were sacrificed for exceeding tumor
volume endpoints six weeks after the challenge (Figure
6, Panel A). Conversely, all CUR- and RES+CUR-treated
mice remained alive at this time. However, eight weeks
after the tumor challenge, the RES+CUR treatment
reduced the tumor mean volume more efficiently than
the CUR treatment (366 mm3 vs 1828 mm3) (p=0.0092).
Intriguingly, treatment with RES+CUR resulted in a
complete regression of tumor growth in 2 out of 6 mice.
These mice remained tumor-free until the 30th week.
Conversely, only one mouse remained alive until the 30th
week in the CUR-treated mice group. When treatment
started simultaneously with the tumor challenge, CUR
and RES+CUR reduced the mean tumor volume more
efficiently than RES (691 mm3 and 440 mm3 vs 1311 mm3,
respectively) (p<0.05) four weeks following the challenge.
All water-, corn oil- and RES-treated mice were sacrificed
for exceeding tumor volume endpoints within 5 weeks,
and the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated mice were sacrificed
by the 9th week (Figure 6, Panel B). Of note, RES+CUR
reduced the mean tumor volume more efficiently than
CUR alone (2092 mm3 vs 3203 mm3) (p=0.046) after
seven weeks.
RES prolonged median survival time compared
to water (6 vs 4 weeks) (p=0.009) and corn oil (6 vs 5
weeks) (p=0.041), but CUR prolonged median survival
time compared to RES when treatment started before the
tumor challenge. However, it is important to note that,
although the RES+CUR treatment prolonged median

survival time when compared to CUR treatment (11 vs
9 weeks), the delay was not significant. When treatment
with compounds started with the tumor challenge, the
median survival time of RES+CUR-treated mice versus
the survival of water-, corn oil- or RES-treated mice was
8 vs 4 weeks (p=0.008), 8 vs 4.5 weeks (p=0.0084) and 8
vs 5 weeks (p=0.01), respectively.
Overall, the risk of developing tumors in water- and
corn oil-treated mice was 15.29 and 9.74 times greater
than in the RES-treated mice, 33.69 and 23.08 times
greater than in the CUR-treated mice and 41.31 and 27.58
times greater than in the RES+CUR-treated mice when
the treatments started before the tumor challenge (Table
3). Moreover, the risk of developing tumors in the REStreated mice was 20.84 and 26.22 time greater than in
the CUR- and RES+CUR treated mice, respectively. No
difference in the risk of tumor development was found
between the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated mice. When
treatments started with the tumor challenge, the risk of
developing tumors in the water-treated mice was 16.44
times greater than in the RES-treated mice and 33.12 times
greater than in the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated mice
(Table 3). The risk in the corn oil-treated mice was 19.60
times greater than in the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated
mice (Table 3). Finally, the risk of developing tumors in
the RES-treated mice was 19.95 times greater than in the
CUR- and RES+CUR treated mice groups. No difference
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was found between the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated mice
(Table 3).
Our results suggest that RES and CUR alone are
able to significantly delay tumor growth and prolong
median survival in comparison to water and corn oil
and that CUR is more potent than RES. However, RES
potentiates the effects of CUR in reducing tumor volume.
In addition, our results indicate that treatment with RES
and CUR is more potent when administered before a
tumor challenge.

Hematological and clinical chemistry parameters
in mice treated with RES and CUR alone or in
combination
To determine whether oral administration of RES
and CUR had side effects on BALB/c mice, hematological
and clinical chemistry parameters were analyzed after
treatment (Supplementary Tables 1-5). Clinical analysis
was evaluated only in mice in which the treatment was
started two weeks before the SALTO tumor challenge, and
the analysis was performed before the treatment and after
4 and 8 weeks after the tumor challenge [34]. The values
of individual mice appeared highly heterogeneous within
each group. Post-treatment measurements performed
4 weeks after the tumor challenge revealed alterations
10754

Oncotarget

in some clinical parameters in each group of mice.
Nonetheless, these alterations were less pronounced in the
CUR- and RES+CUR-treated groups than in the water-,
corn oil-, or RES-treated groups. The water-, corn oil-,
and RES-treated groups displayed a marked decrease in
the percentage of lymphocytes (p<0.01) and a marked
increase in the percentage of granulocytes (p<0.01). In
addition, a marked increase in the total number of white
blood cells (p<0.05) as well as the level of LDH (p<0.01)
was also observed in these three groups. Indeed, at this
stage, the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated groups displayed a
slight decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes (p<0.05)
and a slight increase in the percentage of granulocytes
(p<0.05). In addition, an increase in the level of LDH was
also observed in both the CUR- and RES+CUR-treated
groups (p<0.05).
It is important to note that 8 weeks after the tumor
challenge, the CUR-treated mice displayed a marked
decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes (p<0.01) and
a marked increase in the percentage of granulocytes
(p<0.01). Conversely, the percentages of lymphocytes and
granulocytes in the RES+CUR-treated mice fell within the
reference values. Collectively, these results demonstrated
that RES and CUR alone or in combination did not affect

hematological and clinical chemistry parameters and that
the alterations observed in the water- and corn oil-treated
mice and the CUR-treated mice are likely associated with
tumor growth.

DISCUSSION
Therapeutic methods based on drug mixtures focus
on enhancing clinical responses while lowering side
effects and the incidence of drug resistance. The benefit
of combining multiple components arises from the fact
that each agent can have a single target or mechanism
of action or that different agents may share the same
target or mechanism of action against cancer cells [4,
5, 9, 10]. Thus, the combination treatment could either
enhance the number of targets and/or the mechanisms
of action or increase the effects on the same target,
therefore decreasing the drug concentrations required
for efficacy. Polyphenols can be used to inhibit the
growth of cancer cells due to their ability to affect the
activity of multiple targets involved in carcinogenesis.
Epidemiological studies have shown the association
between the consumption of fruits and vegetables and
the prevention of human diseases, including cancer [5,

Figure 6: Delay of in vivo tumor growth by treatment with RES and CUR alone or in combination. Groups of BALB/c
mice were treated with RES and CUR alone or in combination prior to (Panel A) or simultaneously with (Panel B) SALTO tumor cell

6, 35-38]. However, it must be considered that the poor
bioavailability of polyphenols will influence the effective
dose delivered to tumor cells. The aim of this study was to
determine whether the combination of RES+CUR resulted
in an enhancement of their in vitro and in vivo antitumor
activities on HNSCC cell lines compared to each of the
compounds in isolation.
In this study, we provide evidence that CUR
inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of
HNSCC cell lines and that the combination of RES
and CUR potentiates the apoptotic effect of CUR. The
apoptotic rates obtained with the RES+CUR allowed
a reduction in the dose of CUR required to achieve the
same apoptotic rate in HNSCC cell lines by 1.8 to 2.77
times. The model of interaction between CUR and RES
when used in combination in HNSCC lines indicated the
onset of an additive effect of the two compounds with
respect to the associated single treatment after decrease of
their concentrations. RES+CUR compared to CUR alone
increased PARP-1 proteolytic cleavage and the Bax/Bcl2 ratio mainly by decreasing Bcl-2 protein expression in
HNSCC cell lines. The treatment with CUR and RES +
CUR also induced the activation of the initiator caspases
8 and 9 and the effector caspase 3, which activated both
the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. CUR is able
to trigger apoptosis through both the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway by mimicking the binding with the TNF receptor
and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [20, 39, 40]. However,
the CUR and RES+CUR treatments decreased the p53
expression in HNSCC cell lines. Several studies have
shown that CUR induces apoptosis by increasing the
expression of p53 [41-43]. On the other hand, other studies
have shown that CUR can induce apoptosis without
altering the levels of p53 [40] or even through downregulating p53 expression [44-46]. Thus, the effect of CUR
may be cell-type specific. The decrease of p53 expression
in HNSCC cell lines after CUR treatment might not be
sufficient to alter the activation of the intrinsic pathway
and/or the extrinsic pathway might enhance a weak
activation of the intrinsic pathway. In addition, activation
of apoptosis might be due to transcriptionally-independent
activities of p53 [47].
HNSCC cell lines overexpress EGFR and ErbB2
receptors, which activate ERK1 and ERK2 [48-50]. It was
demonstrated that CUR is able to inhibit EGFR and ErbB2
phosphorylation in breast and colon cancer cell lines and
that the combined treatment of RES+CUR increases these
effects in colon carcinoma cell lines [51]. When activated,
ERK1 and ERK2 are capable of mediating a number of
proliferative signals and the transcription of anti-apoptotic
genes such as Bcl-2 [52]. Here, we observed that RES
potentiated the inhibition of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 by
CUR in HNSCC cell lines. This inhibition could also be
responsible for the inhibition of cell proliferation induced
by treatment with CUR and RES+CUR. In addition, the
decreased Bcl-2 expression in HNSCC cell lines after
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment might also be due to the inhibition of p-ERK1
and p-ERK2.
The NF-κB pathway is often aberrantly activated
during the development and progression of HNSCC [31].
Liposome-encapsulated CUR was shown to suppress
growth of HNSCC in vivo and in xenografts through the
inhibition of NF-κB pathway. Here, we observed that
RES and CUR alone or in combination induced NF-κB
accumulation in the cytoplasm in both cell lines and that
CUR induced the appearance of an extra, lower molecular
weight form of cytoplasmic NF-κB, which might represent
a degradation product and thus indicate CUR-stimulated
degradation of NF-κB. Caspase-mediated proteolysis of
NF-κB has been previously reported [53, 54]. Thus, CUR
could induce inactivation of NF-κB also through the
activation of caspases. In addition, when active, ERK1
and ERK2 can stimulate nuclear translocation of the
transcription factor NF-κB [55]. Accordingly, inhibition
of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 by RES and CUR might be
responsible for inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation.
Moreover, activation of NF-κB induces the expression of
Bcl-2 family genes [56]. Thus, NF-κB inhibition could
make the initiation of the apoptotic process through Bcl2 down-regulation possible. The key role of the Bcl-2
decrease after RES+CUR treatment is also emphasized by
its significance in the initiation of autophagy. Indeed, we
observed that RES+CUR increases the expression of LC3
II an autophagosomal marker compared to CUR alone.
Bcl-2 is able of sequestering Beclin 1, which promotes
the formation of the autophagosome and coordinates
autophagy [57]. The binding of Bcl-2 with Beclin 1
is proteolyzed by the activation of caspase 3. Thus, the
decreased expression of Bcl-2 and the activation of caspase
3 after treatment with RES+CUR might be responsible for
the release of Beclin 1 in the cytoplasm and activation of
autophagy. It has been demonstrated that CUR is able to
simultaneously induce apoptosis and autophagy in human
squamous cell carcinoma cells [21]. Indeed, we observed
that the combined treatment more actively stimulated the
formation of double membranes surrounding vast portions
of cytoplasm. This phenomenon was most evident in cells
that already showed the morphological characteristic of
apoptosis. Although a sustained activation of ERK1 and
ERK2 is required for the activation and maintenance of
autophagy, our results show that RES+CUR inhibit the
phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 simultaneously with
the formation of autophagic vacuoles [52]. On the other
hand, autophagy might result from the ability of CUR to
inhibit the signaling mediated by Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and
induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
as already demonstrated in different tumors [21, 58]. We
observed that CUR rapidly induced the production of ROS
in HNSCC cells and inhibited AKT phosphorylation. ROS
in turn can activate apoptosis and potentiate autophagy
[59].
Finally, taking into account that a limited number
10756

Oncotarget

of animals studies are available on the anti-cancer effects
of polyphenols, we evaluated the in vivo effects of single
and combined RES and CUR treatment in hampering
the growth of transplanted Neu-overexpressing BALBneuT salivary gland cancer cells (SALTO) in BALB/c
mice. Initially, we demonstrated that RES potentiates
the apoptotic effect of CUR on SALTO cells and that
the compounds have an additive effect in inhibiting cell
growth. Then, we performed an in vivo study. RES and
CUR alone or in combination were administered prior
to or simultaneously with the SALTO tumor challenge.
Regardless of the start time of compound administration,
we observed that the RES+CUR treatment reduced the
mean tumor volume more efficiently than CUR alone.
However, although the RES+CUR treatment prolonged
the median survival time when compared to the CUR
treatment, the delay was not statistically significant when
the compounds were given prior to or simultaneously
with tumor challenge. Thus, RES potentiated the in vivo
anti-tumor effect of CUR in agreement with our in vitro
observations. In addition, the administration of CUR
and RES were safe in BALB/c mice. Indeed, RES and
CUR alone or in combination did not significantly affect
hematological or clinical chemistry parameters.
Salivary gland carcinomas are head and neck tumors
that require typical surgical and adjuvant therapy [60].
Although, conservative surgery with nerve monitoring
is the state-of-the-art and adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy
increases local tumor control, the overall survival is not
automatically enhanced [60]. Thus, the development
of novel therapies can supplement the pharmaceutical
armamentarium presently used for salivary gland
carcinomas treatment. We previously demonstrated that
intratumoral delivery of recombinant vaccinia virus
encoding for ErbB2/Neu could inhibit the growth of
salivary gland carcinoma cells in mice [34]. Now, we
report that the combination of two nutraceuticals are able
to reduce the growth of salivary gland tumors without side
effects in mice.
Taken together, our results indicate that the
treatment of HNSCC cells with combinations of CUR and
RES can be more effective in inhibiting in vivo and in vitro
cancer cell growth than the treatment with CUR alone.
Still, additional studies performed both in vitro and in vivo
will be needed to fully define the therapeutic potential of
these compounds.

HNSCC cells were seeded (2.5x104 cells/well) in
8 chambers with permanox (Lab-Tek, IL) in 300 µl of
culture medium, grown for 24 h, and treated with RES
and CUR alone or in combination or with DMSO in
a complete culture medium. After 48 hours, the culture
medium was removed, and after two washes with PBS,
the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room
temperature for 15 min and permeabilized with methanol
for 10 min at -20° C [49]. The cells were then incubated
at room temperature with primary antibodies for 1 h and,
after two more washes, with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa
fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min.
Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. The
slides were then mounted with glycerol, observed with
an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope and analyzed
with the IAS software.

Western Blotting
In total, 1 x 106 cells were seeded in 100 mm tissue
culture dishes 24 hours prior to the addition of 25 μM of
each compound alone or in combination or the vehicle
control. After 24 and 48 hours of treatment, the cells were
harvested, washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA
buffer as previously described [63]. For immunoblot
analysis, 50-80 μg of cell lysates were resolved in
10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Equal loading and transfer of proteins was
verified by Ponceau red staining of the membranes and by
analyzing actin expression. The assay was then performed
as previously described [63]. Total cell lysates were
analyzed for NF-κB expression.

Transmission electron microscopy
Ultrastructural analyses were performed on CAL-27
cells treated with RES and CUR alone or in combination
or with DMSO. After treatment, the cells were fixed in
2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS pH 7.4, and the samples were
processed for transmission electron microscopy following
routine procedures [65].

Treatment of BALB/c mice with RES and CUR
alone or in combination

Fluorescent measurement of Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS)

BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected in the
right flank with a 0.2 ml suspension containing 1x106
SALTO cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Groups
of BALB/c mice (5 or 6 mice per group) were treated per
os with RES and CUR alone (2 mg in 100 μl of corn oil)
or in combination (2 mg of RES in 50 μl of corn oil + 2
mg of CUR in 50 μl of corn oil) or with corn oil (100 μl)
or water (100 μl) two weeks prior or simultaneously to the
SALTO tumor challenge. When treatment started before
the tumor challenge, the mice received daily treatment
for two weeks before the tumor challenge and then 3
times a week following the challenge. When treatment
started simultaneously to the SALTO tumor challenge, the
compounds were administered 3 times a week.
The mice were sacrificed at the first signs of distress.
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines. All experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
and carried out according to the Italian rules (D.L.vo
116/92; CE. 609/86). A veterinary surgeon was present
during the experiments. Animal care, before and after the

Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) was used
to detect ROS production in cells. Briefly, 2.5 × 105
cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated at
37° C to allow cell attachment before treatment. After
two washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 10
μM 2’,7’-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich,
Milan, Italy) in PBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the dark for
30 minutes [64]. After two washing, cells were treated
with RES and CUR, alone or in combination, in serumfree medium and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the
dark for different times (15 min-4 hours). Then, adherent
cells and suspended cells were harvested, centrifuged at
1,250 rpm for 10 min and seeded in 96-well plate (100 μl
per well). Fluorescence intensity was measured after 15
and 30 minutes, 1, and 4 hours using a spectrophotometric
plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and
an emission wavelength of 535 nm. Since the highest
level of fluorescence was detected at 30 minutes, and then
decreased back to the level of the control after one hour of
stimulation (data not shown) this experimental time was
chosen for subsequent experiments.

Analysis of antitumor activity in vivo
Tumor growth was monitored weekly until tumorbearing mice were sacrificed when the tumor exceeded a
20 mm width. Tumors were measured by a caliper in two
dimensions, and the volumes were calculated using the
formula: width2 x length/2 [66].

All blood samples were collected in animals under
i.p. anesthesia (20 μl/g.b.w. of 1.2% Avertin-2,2,2tribromoethanol, 2.4% 2-methyl-2-butanol; SigmaAldrich, Italy). For determination of hematological
parameters, 20 µl of whole blood was collected in
K2EDTA microtainers (Becton, Dickinson and Company,
USA) and the samples were analyzed using the
commercially available automated cell counter “Simply
cell” (BPC BioSed s.r.l., Italy). For cytomorphological
examination, each sample from peripheral blood smears
was prepared using the differential staining Diff-Quick
(Dade SpA, Italy) and analyzed under optical microscopy.
For determination of clinical chemistry parameters, blood
samples were collected in SST microtainers (Serum
Separator Tube; Becton, Dickinson and Company)
and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (5415R model;
Eppendorf s.r.l., Italy) at 13,000 rpm for 7 min to separate
the serum. Cholesterol (CHOL), triglycerides (TRI),
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic
pyruvic transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured using
the automatic analyzer Keylab (BPC BioSed s.r.l., Rome,
Italy).
