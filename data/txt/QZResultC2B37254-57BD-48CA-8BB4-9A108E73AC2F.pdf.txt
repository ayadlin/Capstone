Abstract
All cancers carry somatic mutations. A subset of these somatic alterations, termed driver
mutations, confer selective growth advantage and are implicated in cancer development, whereas
the remainder are passengers. Here we have sequenced the genomes of a malignant melanoma and
a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same person, providing the first comprehensive catalogue of
somatic mutations from an individual cancer. The catalogue provides remarkable insights into the
forces that have shaped this cancer genome. The dominant mutational signature reflects DNA
damage due to ultraviolet light exposure, a known risk factor for malignant melanoma, whereas
the uneven distribution of mutations across the genome, with a lower prevalence in gene
footprints, indicates that DNA repair has been preferentially deployed towards transcribed regions.

The results illustrate the power of a cancer genome sequence to reveal traces of the DNA damage,
repair, mutation and selection processes that were operative years before the cancer became
symptomatic.

The genomes of all cancer cells carry somatic mutations1. These may include base
substitutions, small insertions and deletions (indels), rearrangements and copy number
alterations together with epigenetic changes. Some of these somatic alterations, known as
driver mutations, confer selective clonal growth advantage and are causally implicated in
oncogenesis. By definition, these are found in cancer genes. The remainder are passengers
which do not contribute to cancer development. However, passenger mutations bear the
imprints of the mutational mechanisms that have generated them, unsullied by processes of
selection, and thus provide insights into the aetiology and pathogenesis of cancer.
Over the last quarter of a century several strategies have been used to detect the various
classes of somatic mutation in cancer genomes1. As a result, approximately 400 cancer
genes have been identified1,2 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/) and somatic
mutations from thousands of tumours have provided insights into the mutational processes
operative in human cancer1,3.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

With the advent of the human genome sequence a new strategy was proposed1,4. Systematic
sequencing would identify all somatic mutations of all classes in individual cancer genomes,
yielding complete catalogues of somatic mutation. Technological limitations initially
constrained this to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based resequencing of the coding exons
of protein-coding genes in order to find base substitutions and small indels5-10. Recently,
however, several novel technologies have been developed11,12. These allow sequencing of
randomly generated DNA fragments from cancer genomes and thus detect rearrangements
and copy number changes as well as base substitutions and small indels, providing sufficient
coverage to identify most somatic mutations in an individual cancer genome. These
technologies have previously been used to reveal missense mutations in the coding
sequences of two acute myeloid leukaemia genomes13,14. Here, we report the first
comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome.

The catalogue of somatic mutations
COLO-829 is an immortal, publicly available cancer cell line derived, before treatment,
from a metastasis of a malignant melanoma in a 43-year-old male15. No skin primary was
identified. Using Illumina GAII genome analysers, we obtained more than 40-fold average
haploid genome coverage by aligned sequence from COLO-829 and 32-fold from
COLO-829BL, a lymphoblastoid line derived from the same patient (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Differences from the reference sequence were called in both cell lines. The variant set
obtained from COLO-829BL was then subtracted from that of COLO-829 to establish the
catalogue of somatic mutations in COLO-829.
We identified 33,345 somatic base substitutions. A total of 32,325 were single-base and 510
were double-base substitutions (in which two adjacent bases show somatic mutations)
(Table 1, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Of 48 already known somatic substitutions, 42
were present in the whole-genome catalogue of mutations, a sensitivity of 88%. Of 470
newly found somatic substitutions that were assessed, 454 (97%) were confirmed by
conventional sequencing, indicating a 3% false-positive rate.
A total of 680 small deletions and 303 small insertions were predicted, of which 182 were
evaluated and 66 (36%) confirmed. Thus the false-positive rate for insertions and deletions
was higher than for substitutions. We were unable to estimate sensitivity as only a single

small deletion had previously been reported in COLO-829. This was not called in the wholegenome sequence, although it was present in a subset of reads. Most confirmed somatic
insertions and deletions were of single bases (Supplementary Table 2).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To detect rearrangements we searched for fragments in which the sequence reads from the
two ends mapped discordantly to the genome16. A total of 51 somatic rearrangements were
predicted. We assessed the sensitivity of detection by evaluating the proportion of somatic
changes in genomic copy number for which a rearrangement was found. Thirty out of fortyone (73%) copy number changes examined were detected as rearrangements. However, an
additional seven (17%) were at centromeres or other regions where alignment is expected to
be difficult. Of the 51 rearrangements, 75% were confirmed as somatic by PCR across the
breakpoint junction or the presence of a copy number change in the appropriate position. Of
the 37 somatic rearrangements confirmed by PCR and mapped to the base-pair level (Table
1, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3), 3 were interchromosomal and 34 were
intrachromosomal, including 25 deletions, 6 inversions, 2 duplications and 1 large
intrachromosomal event.
All well-supported somatic copy number changes and regions of loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) detected using genotyping arrays were found by whole-genome sequencing (Fig. 1).
Two regions of high copy number genomic amplification, on chromosomes 3p and 15p, and
two homozygous deletions, on chromosomes 10q and 16q, were observed. Somatic
mutations of mitochondria in cancer have previously been reported, although their role in
oncogenesis is unclear17. No somatic mutations present in more than 20% of mitochondrial
sequences were observed in COLO-829.

Mutations of coding genes and microRNAs

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

A total of 292 somatic base substitutions were in protein-coding sequences (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 4). Of these, 187 caused amino acid changes (non-synonymous),
including 172 that were missense and 15 nonsense, and 7 affected highly conserved bases at
splice sites. There were 105 silent (synonymous) substitutions. One somatic substitution was
found in the microRNA hsa-mir-518d in the central region of the stem structure. None of the
66 confirmed small insertions and deletions was in coding sequences.
On the assumption that most silent mutations are biologically inert, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in protein-coding sequences can be used to
estimate the extent of selection overall on non-synonymous changes6,18. The ratio in
COLO-829 was 1.78, not significantly different from that expected by chance (P=0.5). Thus,
the substantial majority of mutations do not seem to be subject to positive or negative
selection. However, this test will be insensitive to small numbers of selected mutations.
Several individual substitutions highlighted candidate novel cancer genes. For example, two
heterozygous missense mutations (het, p.S229L; het, p.D283H) were in SPDEF, which
encodes a member of the ETS transcription factor family19. SPDEF expression is associated
with disease progression in prostate, breast and ovarian cancer20,21. Sequencing SPDEF
through 48 additional, untreated metastatic melanomas revealed a further somatic mutation
(p.W158*). A missense mutation (het, p.G297E) was identified in the matrix
metalloproteinase gene MMP28. Missense mutations in the family of matrix
metalloproteinases were recently reported in melanoma, including several in MMP28 (ref.
22). A missense mutation (het, p.N561K) was also identified in UVRAG, which was
originally identified in a complementation assay for ultraviolet light sensitivity in xeroderma
pigmentosum group C cells, has recently been shown to have an important role in autophagy
and has been proposed as a tumour suppressor gene23,24. To determine the significance of
these and other mutations, analysis of additional melanomas will be required.

Of the 37 somatic rearrangements mapped to the base pair, 19 interrupted protein-coding
genes. No in-frame fusion genes were predicted, but one gene (MAGI2) had an exonic
deletion that creates a predicted in-frame rearranged transcript. PCR with reverse
transcription (RT–PCR) across the exon–exon rearrangement boundary showed that the
chimaeric transcript is expressed, but the biological significance of this rearrangement
remains to be clarified.

Rearrangements occur at a high frequency in cancer over fragile sites. In COLO-829,
rearrangements were found in FHIT and WWOX, which overlie the fragile sites FRA3B and
FRA16D, respectively. Both rearrangements are contained within individual introns,
however, and are not predicted to alter the sequences of the encoded proteins.
There are several modest copy-number reductions and increases that affect large genomic
regions and which alter the copy number of many protein-coding genes (Fig. 1). Of
particular interest, however, is the relatively restricted region of high (8- to 12-fold) copy
number increase on chromosome 3p which contains four complete genes: RARB, TOP2B,
NGLY1 and KS (OXSM). A ~0.5-megabase (Mb) region on chromosome 15 is also
amplified to 4–6 copies and contains MKRN3 and NDN. None of these genes has previously
been implicated in cancer development through amplification, although another member of
the retinoic receptor family, RARA, is consistently rearranged in acute promyelocytic
leukaemia25. A 12-kilobase (kb) internal homozygous deletion of the recessive cancer gene
PTEN is predicted to cause premature termination and is presumably implicated in the
development of COLO-829. However, the significance of a 40-kb homozygous deletion that
removes the start ATG codon of CNOT1, a repressor of transcriptional activation by
oestrogen receptor26, is unknown.
Of the three previously identified driver mutations in COLO-829, genome-wide sequencing
revealed BRAF V600E in addition to the PTEN deletion described above. A 2-bp deletion in
CDKN2A was not detected, but was found in sequence reads when a targeted search was
made.

A mutational signature of ultraviolet exposure
Most somatic base substitutions in COLO-829 were C>T/G>A transitions (Fig. 2a). Of the
510 dinucleotide substitutions, 360 were CC>TT/GG>AA changes. This mutational
spectrum is reminiscent of that previously associated with ultraviolet light exposure, a
known environmental risk factor in the development of malignant melanoma27-30.
DNA damage due to ultraviolet light leads to the formation of covalent links between two
adjacent pyrimidines31. Consequently, C>T mutations due to ultraviolet light usually occur
at dipyrimidine sequences. Therefore, to evaluate further the role of ultraviolet light in the
pathogenesis of somatic mutations in COLO-829, we examined the sequence context of C>T
substitutions (Fig. 2b). A total of 92% of C>T mutations occurred at the 3′ base of a
pyrimidine dinucleotide compared with 53% expected by chance (P<0.0001). CC>TT
mutations exhibited a similar pattern (82% were 3′ to a pyrimidine, P<0.0001). The
frequency of C>Tand CC>TT mutations due to ultraviolet light exposure is also known to be
higher at CpG dinucleotides27. In COLO-829, both C>T substitutions (7.7%, P<0.0001) and
CC>TT double substitutions (10.0%, P=0.014) showed elevated frequencies at CpG
dinucleotides compared to that expected by chance (4.4%). Therefore, the mutation
spectrum and sequence context indicate that most C>T/G>A somatic substitutions in
COLO-829 are attributable to ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage.

Expression-directed DNA repair

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage is predominantly repaired by nucleotide excision
repair (NER)32,33. NER is a nonspecific repair process activated by sensing of DNA
distortion caused by the DNA modification induced by a mutagen. Over the whole genome,
DNA damage is sensed by a specific protein complex and NER is then implemented through
excision of an oligonucleotide carrying the damage and filling of the gap by replicative
polymerases. The main purpose of this form of NER, known as global genome repair, may
be prevention of somatic mutations that would otherwise be transmitted to daughter cells
through mitosis. There is, however, an additional form of NER that is selectively directed at
the transcribed strand of genes34,35. This transcription-coupled repair is sensed by the
stalling of RNA polymerase II when it encounters a bulky DNA adduct. The purpose of
transcription-coupled repair may primarily be to reduce interference with transcription
caused by DNA damage.
A consequence of transcription-coupled repair is that DNA damage on the transcribed strand
is repaired more efficiently than damage on the non-transcribed strand. Thus, fewer
mutations accumulate on the transcribed strand. We investigated whether transcriptioncoupled repair had been operative in COLO-829 by comparing the number of C>T
mutations found on the transcribed strands of all 21,417 protein-coding genes to the number
of C>T mutations on the non-transcribed strands. There were 2,773 C>T changes on the
transcribed strands and 4,058 on the non-transcribed strands (P<0.0001) (Fig. 2c), with a
similar pattern for CC>TT double substitutions (48 on transcribed strands and 75 on nontranscribed strands). The results are therefore consistent with the past operation of
transcription-coupled repair on ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in COLO-829.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The involvement of transcription-coupled repair predicts an overall lower prevalence of
C>T/G>A substitutions over genic than intergenic DNA. Indeed, only 10,004 (30%) somatic
C>T changes were found over the combined genomic footprints of transcribed genes
compared with 13,164 (40%) expected if the mutations had been randomly distributed
(Table 1, P<0.0001). However, the effect of transcription-coupled repair accounts only for
one-third of the deficit of mutations over protein-coding gene footprints. This suggests the
existence of an additional class of NER which is preferentially deployed to both transcribed
and non-transcribed strands of genes compared to intergenic DNA. A form of NER with
these features has been previously proposed but is not extensively characterized32. We also
observed a reduction in mutation prevalence in exons (8.33 per Mb) compared to introns
(9.93 per Mb, P=0.0001). Preferential targeting of NER to exons has not been reported and it
is conceivable that this effect may, in part, be attributable to negative selection on coding
sequence mutations.
To investigate further the relationship between transcription and NER we examined the
correlation between mutation prevalence and gene expression (Fig. 2d). Genes expressed at
a high level in COLO-829 showed a lower prevalence of somatic mutations compared to
genes expressed at a low level, on both the transcribed and non-transcribed strands. The
effect of transcript levels on mutation prevalence was most pronounced for C>T/G>A
mutations (P<0.0001) but was also observed in other mutational classes. A trend towards a
higher prevalence of somatic substitutions at the 3′ compared to the 5′ ends of genes was
also observed (Fig. 2e). This may be due to aborted transcription, such that 3′ ends are
overall less transcribed than 5′ ends, with the consequence that expression-related repair
processes are deployed less at 3′ ends and hence the mutation prevalence is higher.
Thus, the catalogue of somatic mutations in COLO-829 has exposed multiple levels of
selective application of DNA repair: preferential targeting to transcribed compared to

untranscribed genomic regions; to exons compared to introns; to transcribed DNA strands
compared to non-transcribed strands; and to the 5′ compared to the 3′ ends of genes.

Evidence for other mutational processes
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

C>A/G>T transversions constitute the second commonest class of substitution in COLO-829
and exhibit a distinctive sequence context (Fig. 2b). C>A/G>T mutations also show
evidence of transcription-coupled repair (P=0.002) (Fig. 2c, d). However, the bias is against
G>T mutations on the transcribed strand, suggesting that the original DNA damage was
predominantly on guanine (Fig. 2c). There is substantial evidence that mutagens such as
reactive oxygen species predominantly cause damage to guanine which ultimately results in
G>T changes. Indeed, results from experimental systems suggest that the sequence context
observed in COLO-829 for C>A/G>T transversions is optimal for this class of mutagen36.
Thus, in addition to the direct effects of ultraviolet light, the somatic mutational catalogue of
COLO-829 may harbour traces of subsidiary mechanisms of DNA damage.

Timing of somatic mutations
The catalogue of somatic mutations is a cumulative record of the mutational events that have
occurred during the lineage of cell divisions starting from the fertilized egg and ending in
the cancer cell. By combining information on chromosome copy number change with base
substitutions the relative order of some mutations on this mitotic lineage can be established.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Several genomic regions in COLO-829 show evidence of loss of one parental chromosome,
leading to LOH, followed by re-duplication of the remaining copy. In these regions,
mutations which occurred before the re-duplication event will be homozygous, whereas
those arising after re-duplication will be heterozygous. In most such regions, a small fraction
of mutations are heterozygous, indicating relatively late re-duplication (Fig. 1). However, in
a region of LOH on chromosome 1q, there are more heterozygote substitutions than
homozygote, suggesting earlier re-duplication (Fig. 1). In this region we were therefore able
to compare somatic substitutions that occurred relatively early in the evolution of the cancer
(homozygous mutations) with those that occurred later (heterozygous mutations), and found
differences in their mutational spectra. C>T mutations account for a higher proportion of
early (82%) compared to late mutations (53%, P<0.0001). By contrast, C>A/G>T changes
account for a higher proportion of late (19%) compared to early (2%) mutations. The results
suggest that exposure to ultraviolet light was extinguished after the 1q re-duplication event,
perhaps when the melanoma metastasized, resulting in a reduced rate of C>T/G>A mutation.
Moreover, the increased proportion of C>A/G>T in the later phase suggests that the process
underlying these mutations is, at least in part, unrelated to ultraviolet light exposure.

Discussion
We have generated the first comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from a human
cancer genome. The catalogue includes the overwhelming majority of mutations present in
COLO-829, although there remains a small fraction of base substitutions and
rearrangements that have eluded detection and a small number of false positives. For
insertions and deletions the sensitivity is lower and the false-positive rate is higher,
indicating the need for additional computational approaches to their discovery. Epigenetic
changes have not been included as the technologies for their exhaustive detection are still
under development.
The catalogue of mutations in COLO-829 carries the imprint of past ultraviolet-lightinduced DNA damage together with evidence for auxiliary, independent mechanisms of
damage. The catalogue also bears traces of the DNA repair processes that have been

operative, including transcription-coupled NER and other, less well characterized patterns of
NER deployment. Buried within it are most of the driver mutations that have conferred
selective growth advantage on this melanoma. The total number of drivers for this, or any
other, cancer is currently unknown. Some may be among the 187 non-synonymous
substitutions in protein-coding sequences. However, the possibility of drivers in non-coding
RNAs, regulatory or currently cryptic functional regions of the genome can now be
explored.
In future, the generation of thousands of comprehensive, high-quality catalogues of somatic
mutation will provide powerful insights into the processes of DNA damage, mutation, repair
and selection that underlie the evolution of all human cancers. These will form the basis of
our understanding of cancer causation and development, providing the foundation for
prevention and treatment.

METHODS
Sequencing
Construction of short (200/400 bp) and mate-pair (2/3/4 kb) paired end libraries, flowcell
preparation and cluster generation was as previously described11. Paired end sequencing was
performed on Illumina GAIIx genome analysers as described in the Illumina Genome
Analyser operating manual. Primary data analysis including image analysis, base-calling and
alignment was carried out with the Illumina pipeline.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Substitution detection
The tumour and normal genomes were built and SNP-called separately. Short insert 2*75 bp
paired end reads were aligned to NCBI36 using ELAND11 (v.1.1.1.3;). SNPs were called by
CASAVA11 (v1.2) but with an additional parameter: the 75 base reads were divided into
equal thirds (bins); we then only called substitutions where the non-reference base was
observed at least once either in all three bins, or at least twice in the first bin and once in the
second bin. This parameter removes most false-positive SNPs that are due to insertions and
deletions (indels).
Somatic substitutions were identified as alleles that were called in the tumour genome but
not in the germ line. A depth of at least 10× was required in the germ line. In order to allow
for any under-called positions in the germ line, no observations of that allele were permitted
in the germ line, although one call was permitted if the depth was ≥30×. Substitutions
corresponding to known SNP positions (dbSNP 129) were excluded. Substitutions were
annotated using Ensembl version 52.

Insertion and deletion detection
Indels in the tumour and normal genomes were called using Pindel39, BWA38 and
GROUPER (A. J. Cox et al., manuscript in preparation) on the NCBI36 genome build.
Pindel identifies singleton reads (aligned reads whose mate does not align), splits the
unaligned read and attempts to align it in two portions. BWA aligns reads allowing gaps,

and then samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) can be used to call indels from the
alignments. GROUPER identifies clusters of singleton reads (minimum two), performs a
local assembly of unmapped reads and then maps the contig back to the same region to
identify the indel. Somatic indels were identified by subtracting all indels called using any of
the three methods in the normal genome from indels called in the tumour (minimum of three
reads) with Pindel. A minimum of 10× normal coverage was also required. Indels were
annotated based on Ensembl version 52.

Structural variant detection
Abnormal read pairs that mapped to the genome at an unexpected distance or orientation
were identified, grouped and filtered as previously described16. Structural variants were
called from the long insert data using MAQ alignments, requiring at least ten independent
read pairs in the tumour and no read pairs representing the rearrangement in the normal.
Structural variants were called from the short insert data using both MAQ and ELAND
alignments. When a structural variant was identified, all reads that were predicted to overlap
the breakpoint region based on the location of their paired read and insert size were used to
attempt an assembly across the breakpoint with Velvet40. Assembled contigs were aligned
back to the reference genome to annotate the precise breakpoint.

Confirmation by capillary sequencing
Substitutions and insertions and deletions were confirmed by capillary sequencing across the
region of the mutation. Structural variants were confirmed by PCR across the breakpoint and
capillary sequence. All confirmations were done in both the tumour and normal to determine
if the variants were somatic or germ line.

Copy number determination

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Reads were counted in windows across the genome, corrected for genome uniqueness as
previously described16. A GC correction was applied to each bin count based on a linear
correction for its GC content. An HMM was used to segment the data, taking into account
known breakpoint locations, and to estimate the integer copy number for each segment
(Supplementary Table 5).

Loss of heterozygosity detection
The zygosity of each of ~924,000 known SNP positions (corresponding to SNPs used on the
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array) was determined in both the normal and the tumour. Regions of
LOH (where SNPs were heterozygous in the normal but homozygous in the tumour) were
identified using an HMM (Supplementary Table 6).

Substitution analysis
For mutation context, the bases±10 bp from the mutation were extracted and the number of
each base counted. Context of equivalent changes (for example, C>T and G>A) were
combined. The background context was determined from 100,000 random positions of the
equivalent base type from chromosome 2. The calculation of mutation frequency in
transcribed and untranscribed regions was corrected for sequence gaps and regions of low
coverage. Strand bias was calculated based on annotating each mutation as to whether it fell
on the transcribed or untranscribed strand in Ensembl 52. Gene expression data were derived
from the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array, run in triplicate, normalized and averaged.
Poisson regression was used for the analysis of the effects of gene expression on mutation

prevalence, incorporating the number of at-risk bases in each gene footprint as the offset,
allowing quadratic terms for the relationship between expression and mutation prevalence,
and using a dummy variable for transcribed versus non-transcribed strand mutations.
Duplication timing was determined by calculating the frequency of heterozygous and
homozygous mutations per Mb throughout LOH regions of at least 5 Mb in size, excluding
gaps in the reference sequence. The image of the entire COLO-829 genome was produced
using Circos41.

METHODS SUMMARY

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We sequenced 75 bases from both ends of 200-bp and 400-bp libraries constructed from
the genomes of COLO-829 and COLO-829BL using Illumina GAII Genome Analysers.
To study structural variation, these data were supplemented with paired 50 base reads
from 2-kb, 3-kb and 4-kb mate-pair libraries11. Sequences were aligned to the reference
human genome (NCBI36) using ELAND11, MAQ37 and BWA38. Differences from the
reference sequence were called in both cell lines. The variant set obtained from
COLO-829BL was then subtracted from that of COLO-829 to establish the catalogue of
somatic mutations in COLO-829.

Chromosome ideograms are shown around the outer ring and are oriented pter–qter in a
clockwise direction with centromeres indicated in red. Other tracks contain somatic
alterations (from outside to inside): validated insertions (light-green rectangles); validated
deletions (dark-green rectangles); heterozygous (light-orange bars) and homozygous (darkorange bars) substitutions shown by density per 10 megabases; coding substitutions
(coloured squares: silent in grey, missense in purple, nonsense in red and splice site in
black); copy number (blue lines); regions of LOH (red lines); validated intrachromosomal
rearrangements (green lines); validated interchromosomal rearrangements (purple lines).

bases (top two panels). c, Mutation counts by transcribed (T) and untranscribed (UT)
strands. d, Effect of gene expression on mutation prevalence. Lines are parametrically fitted
curves to the data. Mutation prevalence is expressed as the number of mutations per Mb of
each class. T, transcribed strands; UT, untranscribed strands. e, Effect of distance along the
transcript on mutation prevalence. Each dot represents a 5-kb bin along gene footprints,
from transcription start sites to 200 kb. The y axis shows the fraction of genes in each bin
carrying a somatic mutation.
