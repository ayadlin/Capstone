Abstract
The pervasive view of bacteria as strictly pathogenic has given way to an appreciation of the
widespread prevalence of beneficial microbes within the human body1–3. Given this milieu, it is
perhaps inevitable that some bacteria would evolve to preferentially grow in environments that
harbor disease and thus provide a natural platform for the development of engineered therapies4–6.
Such therapies could benefit from bacteria that are programmed to limit bacterial growth while
continually producing and releasing cytotoxic agents in situ7–10. Here, we engineer a clinically
relevant bacterium to lyse synchronously at a threshold population density and to release
genetically encoded cargo. Following quorum lysis, a small number of surviving bacteria reseed
the growing population, thus leading to pulsatile delivery cycles. We use microfluidic devices to
characterize the engineered lysis strain and we demonstrate its potential as a drug delivery

platform via co-culture with human cancer cells in vitro. As a proof of principle, we track the
bacterial population dynamics in ectopic syngeneic colorectal tumors in mice. The lysis strain
exhibits pulsatile population dynamics in vivo, with mean bacterial luminescence that remained
two orders of magnitude lower than an unmodified strain. Finally, guided by previous findings that
certain bacteria can enhance the efficacy of standard therapies11, we orally administer the lysis
strain, alone or in combination with a clinical chemotherapeutic, to a syngeneic transplantation
model of hepatic colorectal metastases. We find that the combination of both circuit-engineered
bacteria and chemotherapy leads to a notable reduction of tumor activity along with a marked
survival benefit over either therapy alone. Our approach establishes a methodology for leveraging
the tools of synthetic biology to exploit the natural propensity for certain bacteria to colonize
disease sites.

In order to control population levels and facilitate drug delivery using bacteria, we
engineered a synchronized lysis circuit (SLC) using coupled positive and negative feedback
loops that have previously been used to generate robust oscillatory dynamics12,13. The
circuit (Fig. 1a) consists of a common promoter that drives expression of both its own
activator (positive feedback) and a lysis gene (negative feedback). Specifically, the luxI
promoter regulates production of autoinducer (AHL), which binds LuxR and enables it to
transcriptionally activate the promoter. Negative feedback arises from cell death that is
triggered by a bacteriophage lysis gene (ϕX174 E) which is also under control of the luxI
promoter13–15. Importantly, AHL can diffuse to neighboring cells and thus provides an
intercellular synchronization mechanism.

The bacterial population dynamics arising from the synchronized lysis circuit can be
conceptualized as a slow buildup of the signaling molecule (AHL) to a threshold level,
followed by a lysis event that rapidly prunes the population and enables the release of
bacterial contents (Fig. 1b). After lysis, a small number of remaining bacteria begin to
produce AHL anew, allowing the “integrate and fire” process to be repeated in a cyclical
fashion. We used microfluidic devices to observe growth and lysis with a fluorescent protein
(sfGFP) as a proxy for circuit dynamics in attenuated S. typhimurium (Supplementary
Videos 1 and 2). We observed periodic lysis events characterized by peaks in the fluorescent
reporter expression that correspond to population lysis (Fig. 1c). The fraction of lysed cells
remains consistent across subsequent cycles, suggesting that lysis and survival occur in a
stochastic manner (Extended Data Fig. 1a-b). Given the ultimate goal of implementation in
an in vivo microenvironment characterized by variable growth conditions, we tested a range
of incubation temperatures (36°C to 40°C) and perfusion rates (100μm/s to 200μm/s),
measuring an average period of 3 hours across all conditions (Fig. 1d). These findings
demonstrate that the SLC has the capacity to generate robust cycles of bacterial lysis in our
microfluidic devices across a spectrum of environmental fluctuations that is likely to exist in
an in vivo context.
The emergence of bacterial therapies in synthetic biology has accentuated the need for
predictive modeling. This need stems from a bottleneck created by a difference in the
timescales for bacterial cloning versus animal experiments; the circuits required for
candidate therapies can be created much faster than they can be tested in vivo. Therefore, in

order to quantitatively characterize the SLC concept before testing in animal models, we
developed a computational model (Fig. 2a and and Supplementary Information) in order to
define an optimal strategy for subsequent testing in a lower-throughput animal model
setting. We found that high production and degradation rates of the feedback-controlling
proteins resulted in a wider domain of oscillatory dynamics in the parameter space (Fig. 2b).
This model is consistent with our observations that oscillations in S. typhimurium were more
robust than in E. coli, where rates of protein production and degradation were previously
found to be lower16 (Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Video 3). Since the ability to
manipulate circuit behavior enhances the versatility of the system, we explored the tunability
of the lysis period by adding an ssrA degradation tagging sequence on the LuxI protein.
Consistent with model predictions, we observed an increased period and colony firing
amplitude when tracking bacterial population dynamics (Fig. 2c-d and Extended Data Fig.
1d). The SLC thus enables tuning of the period and magnitude of delivery, which will be
necessary for eventual application of this platform in the complex and fluctuating conditions
present in vivo.

To incorporate a cytotoxic payload into the SLC strain, we added expression of Hemolysin
E, encoded by hlyE of E. coli, which has been tested as a pore-forming anti-tumor toxin17.
We initially confirmed the capability of the circuit to release intracellular contents by
visualizing released sfGFP with a small microfluidic sink located beneath the growth
chamber (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Then, in order to visualize bacterial lysis and killing of
cancer cells in vitro via HlyE, we engineered a microfluidic device so that cancer cells
adhere inside a growth channel that is flanked by smaller bacterial growth chambers, which
permits simultaneous single-cell visualization of bacterial lysis and cancer cell death
(Extended Data Fig. 2d). After co-culturing human cervical cancer HeLa cells with S.
typhimurium harboring the SLC circuit, we observed HeLa cell death upon the onset of
bacterial lysis, indicating efficient toxin release (Fig. 3a-b, Supplementary Videos 4 and 5).
Complete cell death occurred in the growth channel within ~111 min of initial sfGFP
fluorescence (Fig. 3c). Thus, the SLC bacteria were capable of releasing HlyE at levels
necessary to kill tumor-derived cells.

Author Manuscript

We assessed the toxicity of released SLC or control bacterial contents in batch culture. As
anticipated, we found that HeLa cells exposed to supernatant from a culture of the SLC
bacteria bearing the hlyE module exhibited almost complete loss of viability (Fig. 3d), while
the viability of HeLa cells exposed to supernatants of and equivalent dose of non-payload
bearing SLC bacteria were only slightly impacted (~15%). We concluded that bacterial lysis
allowed for efficient HlyE release in vitro and that natural intracellular bacterial contents do
not significantly affect HeLa cell viability. We further investigated the delivery
characteristics of the SLC bacteria with hlyE by seeding variable amounts of circuitharboring bacteria with HeLa cultures in well plates. We observed that the time to HeLa cell
death following initial seeding increased with lower bacterial seeding volumes, presumably
resulting from the extended time needed for bacteria to reach the quorum threshold (Fig. 3e
and Supplementary Video 6). Initial seeding with a larger volume of bacteria resulted in
increased firing rates which corresponded to shorter HlyE exposure times until cell death,
consistent with a greater magnitude of lysis and payload release, although the cumulative
toxicity threshold appears to be similar in all cases (Fig. 3f). Based on these observations,

one can adjust the seeding size of the bacterial population to determine the initial timing and
release characteristics of the circuit.

We next used a luciferase reporter to monitor bacterial population dynamics in grafted
syngeneic colorectal tumors in mice. To minimize the extent of plasmid loss in the absence
of antibiotic selection in vivo, we incorporated previously described stabilizing elements for
plasmid retention and segregation into the SLC strain18–22. Additionally, we placed both the
payload and luxCDABE genes (the in vivo reporter module) under the luxI promoter as an
indicator of hlyE production and quorum firing via bacterial luminescence (Fig. 1a). Using a
subcutaneous model of colorectal cancer (MC26 cell line) in immunocompetent mice, we
intratumorally injected a strain of SLC bacteria (SLC-hly). We observed pulsatile bacterial
population dynamics within the tumor (Fig. 4a-c, Extended Data Fig. 3a-b) using In-Vivo
Imaging (IVIS) technology23, consistent with the design and in vitro characterization (Fig.
2). Importantly, the end luminescence intensity was on average ~300-fold lower than the
constitutive control strain, indicating a significant decrease in bacterial population levels
within the tumor (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Author Manuscript

Given the ability to engineer bacterial population dynamics in tumor grafts, we next
leveraged the versatility of the SLC bacteria as a delivery system to compare different
classes of previously developed payloads. In addition to the hemolysin strain that was
characterized in microfluidic devices, we created two additional SLC strains expressing
genes to activate a host immune response (via T-cell and dendritic cell recruitment, using
mCCL21) or trigger tumor cell apoptosis (using CDD-iRGD)24,25. Upon intratumoral
injection, the immune recruitment strain elicited the strongest effect on tumor growth when
compared to the hemolysis or apoptotic strains (Fig. 4d). We observed that an equal mixture
of the three strains generated a stronger response than any single strain (Fig. 4d and
Extended Data Fig.3 e-g), and on this basis we elected to pursue the “triple-strain” dose for
further testing in order to minimize animal usage. In a side by side comparison, we observed
that the tumor response to SLC triple-strain (SLC-3) injections was significantly larger than
the response to unmodified bacteria (Fig. 4e). Additionally, upon necropsy, histopathological
analysis of remnant tumors was performed for mice treated with the SLC-3 strains,
chemotherapy, or unmodified bacteria. In mice treated with SLC-3 and non-circuit bacterial
strains, robust staining of bacteria was observed by anti-Salmonella antibodies, showing
localization of Salmonella within tumors. TUNEL staining indicated higher levels of
apoptosis and cell death in SLC-3 treated tumors (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Author Manuscript

As a first step towards monitoring the effect of bacterial injections on the host, we compared
how the triple-strain system affected body weight when administered intratumorally and
intravenously, since the administration route affects bacterial localization (Extended Data
Fig. 3d). We found that treatment with the SLC strains generated the same weight change as
unmodified bacteria when administered intratumorally (Fig. 4f). However, intravenous
administration of the SLC conferred a greater health benefit based on observations that SLC
strains producing constitutive therapy were better tolerated than unmodified bacteria or nonSLC strains producing constitutive therapy (Fig. 4g). While further targeted studies are
required to systematically explore the impact of these bacteria on host health, these

preliminary experiments suggest that the SLC design can reduce the burden of bacterial
injections.

To explore a proof-of-principle for the application of our circuit in the context of in vivo
tumors, we examined the efficacy of our system in an experimental syngeneic
transplantation model of colorectal metastases within the liver. We had previously
established that oral delivery of these bacterial strains led to safe and efficient colonization
of hepatic colorectal metastases (see Methods), and that mice tolerated repeated dosing
without overt adverse effects (Fig. 5a-b)22. In the context of bacteria-based therapeutic
candidates, previous studies have shown that anaerobic bacteria can occupy avascular tumor
compartments where chemotherapy is thought to be ineffective due to poor drug delivery11.
Thus a synergistic effect may arise when bacteria are used to deliver drugs to the necrotic
core of a tumor, while standard chemotherapy is used for the vascularized regions11,26.
Inspired by this paradigm, we tested the combination of SLC-3 bacteria with a common
clinical chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU). Tumors exhibited similar growth trajectories
in response to repeated oral delivery of either the bacterial therapy alone, or two i.v. doses of
5-FU on Days 0 and 21 (Fig. 5c). In contrast, combination of these two applications led to a
marked decrease in tumor activity over a period of 18 days, followed by a return to growth
(Fig. 5d). During the initial 18-day period, a large fraction of the tumors were scored as
eliciting at least a 30% reduction in tumor activity (Fig. 5e). The overall response led to
roughly a 50% increase in the mean survival time for animals harboring incurable colorectal
metastases (Fig. 5f). Improvements may arise from strategies for long term circuit stability
or the utilization of additional therapeutic cargo.

The synchronized lysis circuit exemplifies a methodology for leveraging the tools of
synthetic biology to exploit the ability of certain bacteria to colonize disease sites. In
contrast to most drug delivery strategies, the synchronized lysis paradigm does not require
pre-loading of a drug or the engineering of additional secretion machinery. In addition, it has
the potential to decrease the likelihood of a systemic inflammatory response through
population control; since the bacterial colony is pruned after each oscillatory lysis event, the
design could mitigate an undesirable host response. The circuit may enable new bacterial
drug delivery strategies through modulation of the frequency and amplitude of the
population cycles over time. Along these lines, cyclic drug release may have broader
implications, given recent insights into the effects of circadian rhythms on host-microbial
interactions and metabolic disorders27,28. Such engineering strategies may allow for the
development of therapeutic communities within in vivo environments, where population
dynamics are driven by interacting viruses, bacteria, and host immune cells29.

a tissue culture incubator at 37°C maintained at 5% CO2. Plasmids were constructed using
the CPEC method of cloning or using standard restriction digest/ligation cloning. The
activator plasmid (Kan, ColE1) was used in previous work from our group, while the lysis
plasmid was constructed by taking the lysis gene, E, from the ePop plasmid via PCR and
cloning it into a vector (Chlor, p15A) under the control of the LuxI promoter13,15. The hlyE
gene was taken via PCR from the genomic DNA of MG1655, while mCCL21 (mouse
CCL21) and CDD-iRGD were synthesized. These genes were cloned into the lysis plasmid,
under the control of either the ptac or pLuxI promoters. Co-culturing was performed with
HeLa cells and either motile or non-motile S. typhimurium, SL1344. For full strain and
plasmid information, please refer to the Supplementary Information.
Microfluidics and Microscopy

Author Manuscript

The microfluidic devices and experiment preparation protocols used in this study are similar
to those previously reported from our group13. The bacteria growth chambers were 100×100
μm in area and approximately 1.4 μm in height. For co-culture experiments on the chip, we
first loaded a suspended culture of HeLa cells in the device media channels at very low flow
rates, to allow for adherence, and then incubated the device in a tissue culture incubator for
0.5 - 2 days to allow for proliferation. On the day of the experiment, the device was
transferred to the microscope and circuit-containing bacteria were loaded in the growth
chambers before imaging. Acquisition of images was performed with a Nikon TI2 using a
Photometrics CoolSnap cooled CCD camera. The scope and accessories were programmed
using the Nikon Elements software. Additional details on microfluidics and microscopy can
be found in the Supplementary Information.

All animal work was approved by the committee on animal care (MIT, protocol
0414-022-17). The cell line (MC26-LucF, Tanabe lab, Massachusetts General Hospital) was
obtained from, and authenticated by, the Tanabe lab, MGH. The cell line was tested several
times to be mycoplasma free before implantation in mice. Sample sizes for mice were
determined by expected effect size to produce a power of 0.8-0.9. Mice were blindly
randomized into various groups using a random number generator.

Subcutaneous Tumor Model—Animal experiments were performed on 6 week old
female BALB/c mice (Taconic Biosciences, Inc.) with bilateral subcutaneous hind flank
tumors from an implanted mouse colon cancer cell line. The concentration for implantation
of the tumor cells was 1e8 cells ml−1 in DMEM (no phenol red). Cells were then implanted
subcutaneously at a volume of 100 μL per flank, with each implant consisting of 1e7 cells.
Tumors were typically grown to an average of 300 mm3 before experiments.
Experimental Liver Metastasis Model—The experimental metastasis model was
generated by injecting luciferase-producing mouse cancer cells into surgically externalized
spleens of immuno-competent mice. Tumor cells seeded the liver during 90 seconds after
which the spleen was removed to prevent ectopic tumor growth30. The MC26-LucF cell line
was used (Tanabe Lab, MGH) and injected at 5e4 cells/100 uL PBS into the spleens of
female Balb/c mice 6 weeks of age (Taconic Biosciences, Inc.). For the liver metastasis

model, tumors were grown for 5-7 days to an average total tumor burden of 143 mm3 before
experiments.

Author Manuscript

Bacterial Growth and Administration—Bacterial strains were grown overnight in LB
media containing appropriate antibiotics and 0.2% glucose as for the in vitro experiments. A
1/100x dilution in fresh media with antibiotics was started the day of injection and grown
until an OD < 0.1 to prevent bacteria from reaching the quorum threshold (for SLC
specifically). Bacteria were spun down and washed 2-3x with sterile PBS before injection
into mice. Intratumoral injections of bacteria were performed at a concentration of 5e7 cells
ml−1 in PBS with a total volume of 10-20 μL injected per tumor, while intravenous
injections were given at a total volume of 100 μL. For the SLC-3 strains injection, this final
volume was equally divided between the three strains at the indicated density. For liver
metastasis experiments, bacteria were grown in LB media containing appropriate antibiotics
and 0.2% glucose until they reached an OD of 0.05, after which they were concentrated to
1-5e9 bacteria/mL and delivered via oral gavage.
Post-Administration Monitoring for Subcutaneous Liver Metastasis Models—
Luminescent signal was measured with the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system following
bacterial injection. Measurements were compared relative to pre-injection values to follow
dynamics. Subcutaneous tumor volume was quantified using calipers to measure the length,
width, and height of each tumor throughout the imaging course (V=L×W×H). Volumes were
compared to pre-injection values to follow physical tumor growth. Survival of mice was
measured as the time from the beginning of the experiment up to the day when mice were
moribund and euthenized.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical tests were calculated either in Microsoft Excel (Student's t-test) or GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, Log-rank test). The details of the statistical
tests carried out are indicated in respective figure legends. Where data were approximately
normally distributed, values were compared using either a Student's t-test or one-way

Construction and characterization of the SLC. (a) The circuit contains an activator13 and
lysis plasmid. When the population reaches the quorum threshold at a critical AHL
concentration, the luxI promoter drives the transcription of gene E for lysis, LuxI, and sfGFP
or luxCDABE as the reporter module. The luxI or the ptac promoter also drives the
transcription of the therapeutic gene for the stabilized circuit used in vivo. LuxR in this
system is driven by the native pLuxR promoter. (b) A schematic that illustrates the main
stages of each lysis cycle from seeding to quorum ‘firing’. Shown below are typical time
series images of the circuit-harboring cells undergoing the three main stages of quorum
firing in a microfluidic growth chamber12. (c) Fluorescence profile of a typical microfludic
experiment. The estimated cell population trajectory reveals that lysis events correspond to
peaks of sfGFP fluorescence. (d) Period as a function of estimated flow velocity in the
media channel of the microfluidic device and environmental temperature. Error bars indicate
±1 standard deviation for 13 - 50 peaks. The above experiments were performed with Strain
1, see Supplementary Information for complete strain information.

Computational modeling and tunability. (a) The model consists of intracellular variables
(lysis gene E and LuxI concentrations) and extracellular variables (colony size and AHL
concentrations). A time series of colony size (black line), colony AHL (blue line),
intracellular LuxI (green line) and lysis protein concentrations (red line) are shown on the
right. (b) The region in the model parameter space for clpXP mediated degradation (see
Supplementary information) and flow where the model output is oscillatory increases with
higher production and degradation terms. (c) Results from the computational model showing
the ability to tune the oscillatory period by varying ClpXP mediated degradation of LuxI. (d)
Fluorescence profiles showing lysis oscillations for LuxI ssrA (black line, Strain 2) and nonssrA (blue line, Strain 1) tagged versions of the circuit. See Supplementary Information for
complete model information.

In vitro co-culture. (a) Schematic of the microfluidic co-culture with cancer cells and
bacteria. Fluidic resistance was modified in this chip to achieve stable near-stagnant flow
reduction to allow for cancer cell adherence and for diffusion of released therapeutic from
the trap to the channel (methods in Supplementary Information). (b) Frames from the coculture time series sequentially visualizing S. typhimurium (Strain 3) ‘firing’, lysis, and
HeLa cell death. (c) Fluorescent profile of the bacteria and HeLa cell viability fraction (#
live cells / # dead cells in image frames) from (b) with time. (d) % viability of HeLa cells
co-cultured with supernatant from S. typhimurium culture harboring the SLC + HlyE (Strain
4), the SLC only (Strain 5), constitutive hlyE only (Strain 6), or no plasmid (Strain 7). Error
bars indicate ±1 standard error averaged over three measurements. (e) Fluorescence profile
of the SLC + HlyE (Strain 4) co-cultured with HeLa cells at various initial seeding densities.
The black ‘x’ marks the point of complete HeLa cell death. (f) The toxin exposure time,
measured from the initial presence of fluorescence to HeLa cell death, as a function of the
sfGFP production rate (see example in (e)). Although the time to death depends on seeding,
the total magnitude of exposure remains conserved (inset). Error bars indicate ±1 standard
error for three measurements. See Supplementary Information for ELH1301 host strain
information.

stabilized SLC-hly strain (Strain 8). (b) Single tumor density map trajectories of bacterial
luminescence (relative to luminescence at 0h) for the SLC-hly strain (Strain 8). Data for
each axis represents separate experiments. (c) Single tumor density map trajectories of
bacterial luminescence for the genomically integrated constitutively luminescent strain
(Strain 9). Intratumoral injection resulted in over 35-fold higher post-injection luminescence
compared to intravenous injection (Extended Data Fig. 3d). (d) Average relative tumor
volume over time for subcutaneous tumor bearing mice injected with SLC-hly (red line,
Strain 10), SLC-cdd (green line, Strain 14), SLC-ccl21 (blue line, Strain 15), and all together
(SLC-3) (black line). Bacteria were injected intratumorally on days 0, 2, 6, 8, and 10 (black
arrows) (****P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, n = 14 - 17 tumors,
s.e.). (e) Average relative tumor volume over time for mice with subcutaneous tumors
injected with the SLC-3 strains (black line, Strain 10, 14, and 15) and the no-plasmid control
(magenta line, Strain 7). Bacteria were injected intratumorally on days 0, 2, 6, and 10 (black
arrows) (****P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, n = 18 - 19 tumors,
s.e.). (f) Average relative body weight over time for mice with subcutaneous tumors injected
with the SLC-3 strains (black line, Strain 10, 14, and 15) and the no-plasmid control
(magenta line, Strain 7). Bacteria were injected intratumorally on days 0, 2, 6, and 10 (black
arrows) (n=10 mice for both cases, s.e.). (g) Average relative body weight over time for
subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice with a single intravenous injection of the SLC +
constitutive hlyE (turquoise line, n=9 mice, Strain 11), a non-SLC strain with constitutive
hlyE (orange line, n=5 mice, Strain 12), or the no-plasmid control strain (magenta line, n=9
mice, Strain 7) (***P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, s.e.).
