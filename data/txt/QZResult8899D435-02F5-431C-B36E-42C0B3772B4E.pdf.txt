ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide. Surgery is the
main therapeutic modality for stage II CRC. However, the implementation of adjuvant
chemotherapy remains controversial and is not universally applied so far. In this
study, we found that the protein expression of lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2)
was increased in CRC and that stage II CRC patients with high ACP2 expression
showed a poorer outcome than those with low ACP2 expression (p = 0.004). To
investigate this discrepancy, we analyzed the relation between ACP2 expression and
several clinical cofactors.
Among patients who received chemotherapy, those with an high expression of
ACP2 showed better survival in both stage II and III CRC than those with low ACP2
expression. In stage II CRC patients, univariate analysis showed ACP2 expression and
T stage to be cofactors significantly associated with overall survival (ACP2: p = 0.006; T
stage: p = 0.034). Multivariate Cox proportion hazard model analysis also revealed ACP2
to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (ACP2: p = 0.006; T stage: p =
0.041). Furthermore, ACP2-knockdown CRC cells showed an increase in chemoresistance
to 5-FU treatment and increased proliferation marker in the ACP2 knockdown clone.
Taken together, our results suggested that ACP2 is an unfavorable prognostic
factor for stage II CRC and may serve as a potential chemotherapy-sensitive marker
to help identify a subset of stage II and III CRC patients for whom chemotherapy
would improve survival.

analysis, an increased ACP2 expression has been reported
in oral squamous cell carcinoma [11]. The study of ACP2
expression in human basal cell carcinoma and normal
skin tissue by cDNA microarray also showed similar
results. These results indicated a high expression level of
ACP2 may occur in human malignant tumors. The exact
physiological and biochemical functions of ACP2 remain
unclear. The roles of ACP2 in human malignancy are also
undecipherable.
In the present study, we showed ACP2 to be an
unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with stage
II CRC. More importantly, high expression of ACP2
served as chemosensitive marker in both stage II and
III CRC; patients with high ACP2 expression achieved
better survival than those with low ACP2 expression.
These findings were partly supported by the finding that
an ACP2-knockdown CRC cell clone showed increased
chemoresistance to 5-FU treatment. Hence, ACP2 may
serve as a potential chemosensitive marker to identify
subsets of CRC patients who would benefit from
appropriate chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third common cancer
the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the
Western world, with more than 600,000 deaths worldwide
each year [1]. In Taiwan, CRC is the second most common
cancer after breast cancer and the third most common
cause of cancer mortality after carcinomas of the lung and
liver. Death resulting from CRC is associated with the
disease stage, a more advanced grade, and the presence
of obstruction [2]. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical
resection has been demonstrated to improve survival in
stage III colon cancer.
Early stage CRC is amenable to surgery and
chemotherapy. These acts in a complementary way can
reduce the risk of local recurrences or distal metastasis.
The current standard protocol of care for patients with
high-risk stage II and stage III CRC is 5-fluorouracil (5FU) or 5-FU/oxaliplatin chemotherapy following surgery
[3]. A number of other cancer treatments, such as breast,
esophageal, and gastric cancers, also generally include
5-FU in combination with other drugs [4]. However,
even with chemotherapy, treatment for CRC may still
result in failure because of the resistance of the tumor.
Indeed, low response rates of 20%–30% have been
reported in metastatic CRC patients [5]. Even with the
improvement of therapeutic modality in recent years,
including the development of new chemotherapeutic
agents, patient mortality from CRC remains very high.
It is, therefore, vital to have reliable biomarkers to
identify the subsets of CRCs that show a good response
to chemotherapy; such biomarkers will eventually bring
important benefits for patients. A number of studies have
been undertaken to clarify the therapeutic and molecular
determinants of individual failures in response to 5-FUbased chemotherapy in CRC, but as yet this aim has not
been sufficiently achieved for the development of targeted
therapy and personalized medicine [6].
Lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2), composed
of alpha and beta subunits, is a lysosomal enzyme
that usually serves as a biochemical marker for this
organelle. The ACP2 gene encodes the major beta subunit
of lysosomal acid phosphatase in humans. ACP2 is
associated with several defects including bone structure
alterations, lysosomal storage defects [7], and abnormal
development of the central nervous system [8]. Deletion
of ACP2 resulted in cerebellum abnormalities, delayed
growth, hair disease, metabolic disorder [9], and an ataxialike phenotype in nax mice [10]. Using cDNA microarray

RESULTS
Correlation between ACP2 expression and
prognosis in stage II and III CRC patients
The relevant clinicopathological data of the 167
CRC patients whose specimens were included in this
study are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. To
determine the prognostic significance of ACP2 expression
in CRC, the tissues were examined by IHC staining. We
first examined 76 sets of matched samples from primary
CRC tumors and non-tumor colon tissues to be sure of
the expression pattern of ACP2. ACP2 expression was
found increased significantly in tumors as compared with
non-tumor colon tissues (Figure 1A and 1B, p < 0.0001).
Figure 1C showed how ACP2 staining intensity was
defined from levels 0 to 3+.
We next investigated the relationship between
ACP2 expression levels and the survival of CRC patients.
Overall, 86 patients with high expression level of ACP2
(scores of 2+ or 3+) had poor overall survival (OS) as
compared with the other 81 patients with low expression
level of ACP2 (with scores of 0 or 1+) (Figure 1D). In
addition, we analyzed the association between ACP2
expression and patients’ survival at different disease
stages. There was a significant association between
ACP2 expression and poor overall survival in stage II

as compared with the other 57 patients with low ACP2
expression (lower than the median value) (P = 0.042,
Figure 1G). Similarly, the overall survival of stage II
CRC patients with high ACP2 expression had a tendency
towards poor prognosis (P = 0.093, Figure 1H), but
again this was not the case with stage III CRC patients
(P = 0.281, Figure 1I). These results were consistent with

CRC patients (P = 0.004; Figure 1E), but not in stage III
patients (P = 0.854; Figure 1F). To confirm the prognostic
value of ACP2, we performed additional survival analysis
using the GEO dataset GSE 17536 [12]. This RNA array
dataset consists of 111 cases of stage II and III CRC.
Among them, 54 patients with high expression levels of
ACP2 (greater than the median value) had poor outcome

CI: 1.058–13.233; P = 0.041). However, in stage III CRC
patients, ACP2 was not significant in either the univariant
or the multivariant analysis. Notably, chemotherapy was
the only valid prognostic factor in stage III patients with
CRC (HR: 0.456; 95% CI: 0.227–0.917; P = 0.027, Table
3). These results suggested that ACP2 expression and T
stage were prognostic classifiers in stage II CRC patients.
Conversely, chemotherapy, which was not commonly used
in stage II CRC, appeared to be a prognostic factor for
stage III patients of CRC. These seemingly paradoxical
results deserved further investigation.

our clinical observations in a seven-year retrospective
record (Figure 1D, 1E, 1F and 1G, 1H, 1I). We therefore
concluded that high expression of ACP2 is an unfavorable
prognostic marker for CRC, specifically in stage II CRC
patients. The univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
hazards analyses further illustrated the association of
ACP2 expression with cancer mortality (Table 1). In
the univariate analysis, high expression of ACP2 (HR,
1.597; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.008–2.530; P =
0.046) was significantly associated with survival. In the
multivariate model, chemotherapy was an independent
prognostic classifier (HR, 0.479; 95% CI, 0.273–0.841; P
= 0.010). Although the association with ACP2 expression
did not reach statistical significance, there was a tendency
that could indicate it to be a prognostic classifier (P =
0.052). However, ACP2 expression was associated with
survival in stages II and III of CRC patients (Figure 1D).
From these data, high expression of ACP2 correlates
significantly with poor outcome and is an independent
prognostic factor in stage II CRC.

Significance of ACP2 expression in response to
adjuvant chemotherapy
Chemotherapy regimens in CRC patients are
primarily 5-FU based. Regardless of ACP2 expression
status, we found that patients who had received adjuvant
chemotherapy tended to have better survival, but without
significance for stage III CRC (p = 0.051; Figure 2A, 2B).
We then analyzed ACP2 expression and its relation to
chemotherapy. Surprisingly, stage II and III CRC patients
with high expression of ACP2 showed significantly
better seven-year survival in response to chemotherapy
compared with those with low expression of ACP2 in
stage II and III CRC (P = 0.002 versus p = 0.136; Figure
2C and 2D).
A combinatorial analysis of ACP2 expression
and adjuvant chemotherapy was conducted separately
for stage II and III CRC. In stage II CRC, high ACP2
expression without chemotherapy had the worst survival
as compared with the other three groups (p = 0.002; Figure
3). In the stage III CRC, a high ACP2 expression without
chemotherapy (n = 10) also had the worst survival (P =
0.044; Supplementary Figure 2), confirming that high

Correlation between ACP2 expression and
survival in stage II and III CRC patients
To clarify the prognostic role of ACP2 in patients
with different stage of CRC, we examined the independent
prognostic value of ACP2 by Cox regression analysis
separately in stage II and stage III CRC patients. In the
univariate analysis, high expression of ACP2 (HR: 3.111;
95% CI: 1.382–7.005; P = 0.006; Table 2) and T stage
(HR: 3.705; 95% CI: 1.101–12.462; P = 0.034) were
significantly correlated with OS in patients with stage II
CRC. In the multivariate analysis, OS was significantly
associated with ACP2 expression (HR: 2.885; 95% CI:
0.799–10.419; P= 0.006) and T stage (HR: 3.742; 95%

ACP2 expression was an unfavorable prognostic factor.
Furthermore, we found that CRC patients (n = 4) with low
ACP2 expression and without chemotherapy showed the
best survival. These results indicate that patients with high
ACP2 expression gained more benefit from chemotherapy
than those with low ACP2 expression. These results
demonstrate the potential of ACP2 expression to be used
as a prognostic marker to identify CRC patients who can
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

examined the expression level of ACP2 in six colon
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1). The level
of ACP2 protein expression in cells was determined by
Western blotting analysis (Figure 4A, 4E). To understand
whether the expression of shACP2 affected cell growth,
we performed a cell proliferation assay. As expected, cell
counting revealed that downregulation of ACP2 expression
induced the proliferation of HCT116 and DLD1 cells
(Figure 4B, 4F). To confirm that ACP2-knockdown
cells were more resistant to 5-FU treatment compared
with vector control by MTT assay (Figure 4C, 4G). We
have calculated the IC50 values (Supplementary Table 2).
We found that the downregulation of ACP2 expression
could significantly induce the HCT-116 and DLD1
cells to survive 5-FU treatment compared with control.
Furthermore, we investigated the expression of PCNA and
p21 in shACP2 cells compared with vector control. Our
results showed knockdown of ACP2 expression increased
PCNA expression and reduced p21 expression in both
HCT116 and DLD1 cells (Figure 4D, 4H). In addition,
we investigated the effect of 5-FU on the knockdown of

Knockdown of ACP2 expression may enhance
chemoresistance
As shown in Figure 2D, ACP2 high expression
of patients to adjuvant 5-FU have more best prognosis.
Therefore, we thought that high expression of ACP2 in
CRC patients was associated with increased sensitivity to
5-FU chemotherapy. To examine whether this was because
the expression of ACP2 induced chemosensitivity, we used
the shACP2 lentivirus to knock down ACP2 expression
in human CRC cell lines HCT-116 and DLD1 after we

ACP2 expression in HCT116 cells treated with different
concentrations of 5-FU (0, 50, and 75 μM) for 48 h. The
results showed that, compared with vector control, the
expression of PCNA increased with the concentration of
5-FU treatment (Figure 4I).
In examining whether knockdown of ACP2
expression could increase resistance to 5-FU, further
analysis of the cell cycle showed that, under treatment
with 5-FU, the control cells had greater subG1 phase cell
accumulation (43.50%) compared with that of shACP2#1
(7.63%), shACP2#2 (8.87%). The ACP2-knockdown
cells significantly inhibited cells in the subG1 phase,
with a concomitant decrease of cells in the G2-M phase
compared with vector control cells (Figure 5A, 5B).
Taken together, these results indicated that the
knockdown of ACP2 markedly increased cell proliferation,

inhibited cell apoptosis, and resistant to chemotherapy in
CRC cells. These data were consistent with our clinical
results.

Knockdown of ACP2 expression with adjuvant
5-FU enhanced chemoresistance and tumor
migration/invasion
In 2015, Holle et al. reported that cancer cells or
tumors could bring resistance through creating highly
organized extracellular matrix structures that inhibit drug
penetration [13]. For this reason, we future examined
to cell migration and invasion abilities were detected in
ACP2 knockdown HCT116 cells and DLD1 cells with or
without 5-FU treatment in a transwell assay. The results
suggested that knockdown of ACP2 enhanced migration

for ACP2 expression to act as a predictor of the level of
success of adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer.

were MSI-H positive in a previous study [17] and 10% in
Taiwan [18, 19]. In this study, we analyzed the relationship
of ACP2 expression with chemotherapy requirement and
the outcome of the patients analyzed. The results revealed
that ACP2 was an unfavorable prognostic marker for
stage II CRC. Nevertheless, concomitant chemotherapy
targeting ACP2 had significantly better survival in stage
II CRCs. These findings indicate that ACP2 was not
only a prognostic factor but also a novel biomarker for
the prediction of chemotherapeutic success for high-risk
patients with stage II CRC.
It is well known that T stage stands for a risky
indicator in stage II CRC patients [20], which was
consistent with the data shown in Table 2. Further
analysis using multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression suggested that T stage and ACP2 expression
were independent prognostic markers for the overall
survival in stage II CRC. Therefore, commination of T
stage and ACP2 expression provides effective diagnostic
criteria of CRC patients with chemotherapy. In contrast
to a similar assay for stage III CRC patients, they did not
show a significant relationship (Table 3). ACP2 expression
serving as a potential predictor to treatment response is
more reliable for stage II than stage III CRC.

DISCUSSION
Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy affects prognosis
and survival in stage III and high-risk stage II patients
of CRC. By now, the first steps in the risk assessment
for CRC are pathologic tumor stage and mismatch
repair (MMR) status. In general, CRC patients of stage
II classified a low risk condition normally are not
recommended for chemotherapy. The GeneFxColon,
OncoDefender-CRC and ColoGuideEx are well-developed
to identify special patients with stage II CRC, which
mostly equal to a higher risk of relapse and recommended
for chemotherapy [14]. However, the abovementioned
analyses have still not been applicable in a clinical setting
for the risk of reliable prospective, independent validation
[15] and issue of cost [16]. High microsatellite instability
(MSI-H), the most reliable analysis, is a good prognostic
factor for stage II CRC patients, but ineffective in benefit
prediction for adjuvant therapy. Only 15% of CRC patients

Melquist et al. has shown the block of microtubuleassociated protein tau (MAPT) H1 haplotype associated
with parkinsonism; the ACP2 gene is involved in this
scenario. In this connection, lysosomal dysfunction
has been incriminated in aging and neurodegeneration
[20]. As aforementioned, ACP2 plays an important
role in developmental biology. It is well known that
development-related genes promoted carcinogenesis,

in which cells featured abnormal differentiation
or proliferation by itself [21]. Cell proliferation in
irregular conditions increased the incident rate of tumor
formation by treatment with 2-acetylaminofluorene, a
potential human carcinogen [22]. The downregulation
of ACP2 expression increased PCNA expression and
decreased p21 expression, resulting in the proliferation
of HCT116 and DLD1 cells and more resistance to 5-FU

treatment (Figure 4). The present findings bolster the
high expression of ACP2 in tumor cells, which may link
to cell fate.
ACP2 is located in lysosomes and involved in the
formation of autolysosomes in autophagy mechanics.
Hiroshi et al., had shown that the knockdown of
Beclin1, a well-known autophagy gene, induced cell
proliferation in human ovarian clear cell carcinomas
[23], and provoked chemoresistance [24]. The resulted
chemoresistance in gastric cancer was also evidenced
in the suppression of ING5, which stimulated tumor

cell migration and invasion in concurrence with the
inhibition of autophagy [25]. The autophagy invalidation
was well known in the knockdown of another autophagy
gene, Apg7, which consequently reduced apoptotic cells
[26]. The suppression of autophagy could hence trigger
an enhanced chemoresistance. Additionally, recent
studies have shown that enhance of drug-resistance
resulted in cell migration and invasion ability [27–29].
A study by Liu et al. demonstrated that HepG2 cell line
resistant to sorafenib showed enhanced cell migration
and invasion capability and decreased cell apoptosis.

Chi et al. reported that drug resistance in cancer could
promote cell growth, metastasis, and invasion. These
results supported the hypothesis that chemoresistance
may promote cellular migration and invasion which
has also been shown in our results”. In this study,
the knockdown of ACP2, leading to 5-FU resistance,
decreased apoptotic cells (Figure 4), and Becline 1
and Apg7 levels (Supplementary Figure 3). In this

connection, ACP2 may be involved in chemoresistance
through autophagy.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated
that the extent of ACP2 expression in patients might
be a novel prognostic and therapeutic predictor marker
for stage II CRC. Adjuvant chemotherapy is highly
recommended for Stage II CRC patients with high ACP2
expression.

Cell proliferation

ACP2 survival analysis using online databases

5×104 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and were
cultured in complete RPMI 1640 or DMEM containing
10% FBS for cell proliferation assay. The cell numbers
were counted every 24 h using Countess™ (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA).

RNA microarray analysis results of 111 patients
with CRC were collected from the GSE database
(GSE 17536) to evaluate the correlation between
ACP2 expression and patient outcomes. The average
expression level of all ACP2 probes with quantile
normalization were used to represent the RNA
expression level of ACP2. The samples were splited
into two risk groups of the same size according to

multiplied by gene expression values.

Lentivirus-based shRNA production and
infection
Lentivirus-based production and infection followed
a previously published protocol [30]. Briefly, the lentiviral
shRNA constructs were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Lentiviruses were
produced by calcium phosphate transfection method
(Invitrogen) and created by co-transfection of shRNAexpressing plasmids, envelope plasmids (pMD.G) and
packaging plasmids (pCMV-dR8.91) in 293T cells. The
transfected 293T cells were incubated in the culture
medium for 18 h; the supernatant was then removed and
refreshed. The supernatants containing the shRNA viruses
were harvested and tittered at 72 h post-transfection. CRC
cells were infected with the lentiviruses in the presence of
Polybrene (8 μg/mL), and were proceeded enrich infected
cell by puromycin selection (2 μg/mL).

Specimens
Specimens from a total of 167 patients with stage
II and III CRC who received colonic resection were
included in this study. The patients were followed up for
84 months. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically
removed CRC tumor tissues were retrieved from Wan
Fang Hospital following the approval of the Institutional
Review Board (WFH-IRB-99049). Pathological diagnoses
of each case was confirmed by pathologists (CYS, MH,
and CLC) in accordance with the WHO classification.
The adequate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical
specimen tissues of each case were carefully selected and
a 1-mm-diameter tissue core of each tumor was taken to
construct the tissue microarray.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed at 4 °C in RIPA buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
Equal amounts of proteins were separated by using sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred
to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
After blocking with 5% non-fat milk, the membrane
was incubated with specific antibodies overnight at
4 °C and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. The blots
were visualized by using an ECL-Plus detection kit
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) [31].

Immunohistochemistry staining and analysis
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was
performed by automated immunostainer (Ventana
Discovery XT autostainer, Ventana Medical Systems
Inc.) on 5-μm-thick tissue sections cut from the tissue
microarray. Briefly, after dewaxed thoroughly xylene and
ethanol, antigen retrieval was performed using a citrate
buffer at pH 6.5 for 8 min. The sections were then reacted
with polyclonal rabbit ACP2 antibody (1:400; GeneTex,
Irvine, CA, USA). The sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin after developed with diaminobenezidine
(DAB). The IHC results were separately scored by two
pathologists (CLC and CYS), scoring ACP2 expression
according to a four-tiered approach: negative (0),
weak (1+), moderate (2+), and strong (3+). Low ACP2
expression was defined as negative (0) or weak expression
(1+), and high ACP2  expression as moderate (2+) or
strong expression (3+).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by using the standard
MTT assay. Briefly, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were grown on
a 96-well plate supplemented with culture medium. After
overnight incubation, the cells were treated with 5-FU for
72 h. At the end of treatment, 20 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL)
was added to the culture medium and incubation continued
at 37 °C for additional 4 h. The absorbance was measured
with a spectrophotometer at 560 nm. A blank with DMSO
alone was measured as a background control [31].

Cell cultures
The human CRC cell line HCT-116 was purchased
from ATCC (CCL-247) and was maintained in RPMI 1640
Medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10% (v/v) FBS
at 37 °C, and 5% CO2.

then incubated in 2 mL of complete RPMI 1640 with 50
μM of 5-FU for 48 h. After treatment, cells were washed
once with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested
by trypsinization. For flow cytometry, cells were briefly
incubated with 10 μg/mL RNase A at 37 °C for 15 min
and then stained with 5 μg/mL Hochest 33342 and 20 μg/
mL PI for 10 min at room temperature away from light.

Migration assay

REFERENCES

The physical wounding of cell cultures was used
to assess cell migration (ibidi, see http://www.ibidi.
de). Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per chamber
and allowed to attach overnight with or without 5-FU
treatment. The following day, culture inserts were
removed and light microscopy images acquired (three
per condition). Cells were cultured during the migration
assay and incubator in normal conditions, and images
were acquired 24 h and 36 h later. Images were analyzed
using ImageJ software.

Invasion assay
8-mm polycarbonate filters were coated with
Matrigel on the lower side, with 3 × 105 cells loaded
on the upper chamber. After 6 h, half the cells were
treated with 5-FU. After 24 h or 42 h, the membranes
were fixed and stained with 0.2% crystal violet/20%
methanol. Quantification was performed by counting the
stained cells. The invaded cells were counted under light
microscope (200 fold, five random fields from each well).
All experiments were performed in triplicate.
