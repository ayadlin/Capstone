ABSTRACT
Survivin overexpression is associated with poor prognosis of human gastric
cancer, and is a target for gastric cancer therapy. YM155 is originally identified as
a specific inhibitor of survivin. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect
of YM155 on human gastric cancer. Our results showed that YM155 treatment
significantly inhibited cell proliferation, reduced colony formation and induced
apoptosis of gastric cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, YM155
treatment significantly decreased survivin expression without affecting XIAP
expression and increased the cleavage of apoptosis-associated proteins caspase 3, 7,
8, 9. YM155 significantly inhibited sphere formation of gastric cancer cells, suppressed
expansion and growth of the formed spheres (cancer stem cell-like cells, CSCs) and
downregulated the protein levels of β-catenin, c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and CD44 in gastric
cancer cells. YM155 infusion at 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days markedly inhibited growth
of gastric cancer xenograft in a nude mouse model. Immunohistochemistry staining
and Western Blot showed that YM155 treatment inhibited expression of survivin and
CD44, induced apoptosis and reduced CD44+ CSCs in xenograft tumor tissues in vivo.
No obvious pathological changes were observed in organs (e.g. heart, liver, lung and
kidney) in YM155-treated mice. Our results demonstrated that YM155 inhibits cell
proliferation, induces cell apoptosis, reduces cancer stem cell expansion, and inhibits
xenograft tumor growth in gastric cancer cells. Our results elucidate a new mechanism
by which YM155 inhibits gastric cancer growth by inhibition of CSCs. YM155 may be
a promising agent for gastric cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Moreover, overexpression of survivin is detected in gastric
cancer cells during drug treatment, indicating that survivin
may contribute to chemo-resistance in gastric cancer [810]
Recent studies showed that survivin is also
associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). Survivin has
been demonstrated to be a downstream gene of the Wnt
signal pathway and is highly expressed in colon cancer
stem cells [11]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has also been
demonstrated to be essential for the proliferation of gastric
CSCs [12, 13]. Zhang et al. found that mutant APC upregulates survivin, causing apoptosis inhibition and the
expansion of colon tissue stem cells in the colon crypt,
thereby initiating colon tumorigenesis [14, 15]. Carter

Gastric cancer is one of the world’s most common
malignancies. Although diagnosis and treatment of gastric
cancers have been greatly improved, the overall survival
rate remains low. Less than 20% of patients with gastric
cancer survive to 5 years [1]. Survivin, a member of
inhibitor apoptosis (IAP) protein family, is implicated in
both cell survival and regulation of mitosis in cancer cells
[2, 3]. Survivin is expressed in various primary tumors,
but is rare expressed in normal differentiated tissues
[4]. Previous studies showed that an over expression of
survivin is found in human gastric cancer tissues, and is
a poor prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients [5-7].

RESULTS

et al. showed that survivin is overexpressed in AML
stem/progenitor cells [16]. These results suggest that
survivin is a potential target for inhibiting cancer stem
cells proliferation. Whether YM155 downregulates other
target genes of CSC signaling such as β-catenin, c-Myc,
Cyclin D1 and CD44 remains unknown. CD44 has been
demonstrated to be a marker of human gastric cancer CSC
and CD44+ gastric cancer cells have stronger tumorigenic
than CD44- gastric cancer cells [17, 18]. However, whether
YM155 inhibits gastric CSCs remains to be investigated.
Several approaches have been developed to
target inhibition of survivin for cancer therapy. Those
approaches include, administering a molecular antagonist
to target survivin mRNA and to inhibit survivin
translation (including antisense oligonucleotides,
ribozymes and small interfering RNAs), utilizing gene
therapy approaches grounded on the use of survivin
dominant-negative mutants (Cys84Ala, Thr34Ala)
and the application of the survivin promoter to drive
the expression of cytotoxic genes; survivin-based
immunotherapy; small-molecule antagonists (suppressing
survivin function) [19]. Considerable effects have also
been made to target inhibition of survivin for gastric
cancer therapy. For example, RNAi-mediated survivin
knockdown can effectively inhibit the growth of gastric
cancer cells [20, 21]. Our previous studies have shown that
suppression of survivin expression or function by plasmid
vectors encoding antisense survivin or survivin dominantnegative (DN) mutant (Cys84Ala) can inhibit gastric
cancer carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo [22]. While
those approaches are effective, it is still difficult to use in
clinic. Recent studies showed that YM155, a novel small,
imidazolium-based compound can specifically inhibit
survivin expression and induce apoptosis in human cancer
cells [23]. Preclinical studies demonstrated that three to
seven-day continuous infusion of YM155 (1-10mg/kg.d)
significantly inhibited tumor growth in hormone-refractory
prostate cancer, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer
[24]. Moreover, recent results from completed phase I/II
clinical studies show that YM155 was safe at a dose of
4.8 mg/m2/day for 168 hours every 3 weeks and exhibited
encouraging anti-cancer effect in advanced cancer patients
[25-29]. These results suggest that YM155 is a promising
agent for cancer therapy.
However, there are no studies to show that YM155
inhibit gastric tumor growth in vivo. In this study, we have
evaluated the antitumor effect of YM155 in gastric cancer
cell lines. We found that YM155 induced apoptosis of
gastric cancer cells, inhibited expansion of gastric CSCs
and expression of CSC molecules CD44 and β-catanin
and suppressed gastric cancer xenograft growth. Our
results, for the first time, demonstrate that YM155 inhibits
gastric cancer growth by inhibition expansion of CSCs and
document a new mechanism that YM155 inhibits tumor
growth.

YM15 inhibits cell proliferation in gastric cancer
cells
To investigate the effect of YM155 on cell
proliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro, gastric cancer
SGC-7901 and MKN-28 cells were treated with YM155
for 48 hours; cell proliferation was measured by MTT.
The results showed that YM155 significantly inhibited cell
proliferation. The mean IC50 of SGC-7901 and MKN-28
cells were 13.2 nM and 11.6 nM (Figure 1A), respectively.
YM155 has also shown a great activity against other
gastric cancer cell lines, such as AGS and Hs 764T cell
lines, with IC50 values 0.8 nM and 7.3 nM [24].
To further investigated the effect of YM155 on
cell transformation. Soft agar assay was conducted to
determine cell transformation in vitro. The result showed
that gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells treated with YM155
formed less number of colonies and smaller size colonies
in soft agar compared to control cells treated with DMSO
(Figure 1B, upper panel). Same results were obtained
in AGS cells (Figure 1B, bottom panel). Quantification
analysis showed that YM155 treatment significantly
inhibited colony formation in gastric cancer SGC-7901
and AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C).
The rates of colony formation in SGC-7901 were reduced
by 55.7% and 86.9% at dose of 5 nM and 10 nM of
YM155, respectively. Similar results were obtained in
AGS cells. YM155 at 5 nM and 10 nM reduced colony
formation of AGS cells by 28.9% and 50.3%, respectively,
compared with control DMSO treatment. These results
suggest that YM155 inhibits anchored-dependent and
anchored-independent growth of gastric cancer cells.

YM155 induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells
To investigate the effect of YM155 on apoptosis
of gastric cancer cells, we first determined the effect of
YM155 on survivin expression. The results showed
that YM155 effectively inhibited mRNA expression
of survivin in SGC-7901 and MKN-28 cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A). FACS analysis showed
that YM155 induced apoptosis of SGC-7901 (Figure
2B) in a dose-dependent manner. Quantification analysis
showed that apoptosis rates were significantly increased
in YM155-treated gastric cancer cells compared to the
control groups (Figure 2C), the apoptosis rates were 47.6
± 2.9% and 82.4 ± 3.4% when SGC-7901 cells treated by
YM155 at the doses of 10 nM and 20 nM YM155 for 24
hours, respectively. The apoptosis rate of control group
was only 6.2 ± 0.2%. Same results were obtained in AGS
cells (Figure 2D). The results demonstrate that YM155
induce apoptosis of gastric cancer cells efficiently.

YM155 induces apoptosis by activating intrinsic
and extrinsic apoptotic pathways

PARP (the substrate of caspases 3). Furthermore, YM155
treatment could increase the cleavage of both caspase-9
and caspase-8, which are involved in intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptosis signal pathways, respectively (Figure 3A).
To further confirm whether YM155 induces
apoptosis through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptosis pathways, we tested the effects of caspase-8
and caspase-9 inhibitors on YM155-induced apoptosis.
TUNEL results showed that pre-treatment with caspase-8
inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK (20 M) or caspase-9 inhibitor
Z-LEHD-FMK (20 µM) for 1 hour significantly decreased
YM155-induced apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells (Figure 3B).

To investigate the underlying mechanisms by which
YM155 induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, we
determined the effect of YM155 on caspases signaling.
Western Blot showed that YM155 could decrease protein
level of survivin in a dose-dependent manner without
affecting the level of XIAP (Figure 3A). Accordingly,
YM155 treatment significantly increased the cleavage
of effector caspases such as caspase-3, caspase-7, and

Quantification analysis showed that the apoptosis rate of
SGC-7901 cells in YM155 treated group was 17.2% ±
7.2%, while pretreated with 20 M caspase-8 inhibitor or
caspase-9 inhibitor for 1 hour, the apoptosis rates of SGC7901 cells were 4.9% ± 1.8% and 5.2 ± 1.4%, respectively
(Figure 3C), suggesting that caspase-8 and caspase-9
inhibitors inhibit YM155-induced apoptosis. These results
demonstrate that YM155 induced apoptosis by triggering
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

sphere formation. SGC-7901 cells and AGS cells were
cultured in SCM with and without YM155 for 2 weeks.
Quantification analysis of spheres showed that YM155
reatment significantly reduced spheres formation in SGC7901 and AGS cells in dose dependent patterns (Figure
4A). These results indicate that YM155 can inhibit
formation of spheres in gastric cancer cells. To determine
whether YM155 also reduces expansion of gastric CSCs,
SGC-7901 cells were first cultured in SCM for one week
to form sphere. One week after culturing, SGC-7901 cells
formed small spheroid colonies (spheres) (Figure 4B,
upper panel). These formed spheres of SGC-7901 cells
were then treated with YM155 at the doses of 1 nM, 10
nM and 20 nM in SCM for one more week. We observed
that vehicle-treated spheres greatly expanded and formed
large size colonies, and that YM155-treated spheres grew
slowly, and formed smaller size colonies compared to
vehicle-treated spheres (Figure 4B, bottom panel). The
similar inhibition of sphere growth was also observed

Overexpression of survivin has been shown to be
associated with CSCs. Hypothesized that YM155 can
suppress gastric CSCs by inhibition of survivin. Several
approaches have been developed to evaluate CSCs [3032]. One approach is to use a in vitro method, “spheroid
colony formation”, that candidate CSCs were cultured
in serum-free medium containing only EGF and bFGF
(stem cell medium, SCM) using a ultra-low-attachment

We then explored the underlying mechanisms by
which YM155 inhibits the expansion of gastric CSCs.
Since Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been demonstrated to
be essential for the expansion of gastric CSCs [12, 13],
we tested the effect of YM155 on Wnt signaling. Western
Blot showed that YM155 decreased the level of β-catenin
and the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1, which are
downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Figure 4C).
CD44 has been identified as a marker of gastric CSCs [17,
18, 33]. YM155 treatment downregulated expression of
CD44 in gastric cancer cells (Figure 4C). These results

We finally investigated the effects of YM155
on tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. SGC7901 cells were injected into the frank of athymic nude
mice to establish tumor xenograft. When tumor size
reached around 80 mm3-100 mm3, mice received a 7-day
continuous infusion of YM155 at 5 mg/kg/day or vehicle
control. The results showed that tumors in the mice treated
with YM155 grew slowly compared to tumor in the mice
treated with vehicle control (Figure 5A-5B). Tumor

significantly weaker than in those from vehicle-treated

the number of survivin+ staining cells in the tumors from
YM155-treated mice were also significantly lower than in
those from vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6C). The results
suggest that YM155 inhibit survivin expression in vivo.
Accordingly, we found that YM155 treatment
increased the number of cleaved caspases-3-positive cells
(apoptotic cells) in xenograft tumor tissues compared to
control treatment (Figure 6B). Quantification analysis
showed that caspase 3 positive rates in the tumor was
significantly higher in YM155-treated mice than vehicletreated mice (2.80% ± 0.11% vs 1.07 ± 0.15 %, p < 0.01)
(Figure 6D). These results indicate that YM155 induces
apoptosis of gastric cancer in vivo.

Assessment of YM155 treatment safety

in xenograft tissues by Western Blot and IHC staining.
Western blot showed that the protein levels (densities
of band) of CD44 in the tumors from YM155-treated
mice were lower than those in the mice from vehicletreated mice (Figure 6A left and right panel). Although
IHC staining showed that the number of CD44+ staining
cells was not significantly different between the groups,
the intensity of CD44+ staining were markedly weaker
in tumor tissues from YM155-treated mice compared to
those in tumor tissues from vehicle-treated mice (Figure
6B). Quantification analysis showed that the densities
of CD44+ positive staining were significantly lower in
the tumor from the YM155-treated mice than those in
tumor tissues from vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6E). The
results indicate that YM155 reduces CD44 expression and
inhibits gastric CSCs in vivo

We also determined the effects of YM155 on
normal tissues. Furthermore, we did not observe obvious
pathological change in some organs (heart, liver, lung, and
kidney) of YM155-treated mice (Figure 7), suggesting that
YM155 treatment is safety in our mouse mice model.

DISCUSSION
Survivin is highly expressed in the majority of
human cancer tissues, including gastric cancer, and is
associated with drug-resistance and poor prognosis [34,
35]. Suppression of survivin expression or function
resulted in spontaneous apoptosis, increased sensitivity
to cytotoxic drugs and suppression of tumor growth in
a nude mouse model [22, 36]. These data indicate that
targeted inhibition of survivin is a potential and promising
approach for the treatment of gastric cancer [22]. In this
study, we further found that YM155, a specific survivin

suppressant [24] , induced apoptosis of gastric cancer
cells, inhibited expansion of gastric CSCs and reduced
expression of CSC molecules (CD44 and β-catanin) and
suppressed gastric cancer xenograft growth. Our results,
for the first time, demonstrate that YM155 inhibit gastric
cancer growth by inhibition CSCs and document a new
mechanism that YM155 inhibits tumor growth.
Our previous studies have demonstrated that
inhibition of survivin function by AAV-mediated survivin
mutant or inhibition of survivin expression by antisense
oligonucleotide suppress gastric and colon cancer growth
[37, 38] . Although AAV vector can efficaciously mediated
long-term expression of survivin mutant, its safety and
inconvenience are still the obstacles for its clinical use.
YM155 is a small imidazolium-based molecule that
inhibits specifically both mRNA and protein expression of
survivin [24] . YM155 has been demonstrated to suppress
the growth of a large number of human cancers including
non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, hormonerefractory prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, leukemia, nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma, esophageal
cancer, renal cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma [24, 3942] . The combination of YM155 and chemotherapeutic
drugs (including etoposide, platinum, doxetaxel) enhanced
inhibition of survivin expression, resulting in stronger
inhibition of tumor growth in some cancer types such as
non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and neuroblastoma.
The mean log growth inhibition of 50% (GI50) value
was around 15 nM for YM155 [43-45]. In this study, we
have demonstrated the potent anti-proliferation activity
of YM155 to gastric cancer cells with the mean IC50 of
YM155 was 11.6~13.2 nM. The data suggest that gastric
cancer cells are also sensitive to YM155. Furthermore,
we showed that YM155 significantly inhibited gastric
xenograft tumor growth in a nude mouse model and
reduced tumor weight, exhibiting strong anti-tumor effect.
Our results demonstrated that survivin inhibitor, YM155,
is able to inhibit gastric cancer growth.
Survivin has been demonstrated to inhibit caspase
9 and caspase 3, resulting in inhibition intrinsic apoptosis
pathway [46]. Previous studies have suggested that
YM155 specifically down regulates survivin expression
in prostate cancer cells and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cells without affecting other proteins [23, 47].
Our results showed that YM155 downregulated survivin
expression without affecting XIAP and induced cleavage
of caspase 3, caspase 9 and caspase 8. Furthermore,
the inhibitors of caspases 9 and caspase 8 significantly
suppressed YM155-induced apoptosis, suggesting that
YM155 induces apoptosis by activating intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptotic pathway. A study showed that YM155
not only inhibits survivin, but also regulate expression
of a large number of genes including in death receptor
signaling and TNFR1 signaling that induce apoptosis
through a extrinsic apoptosis pathway [48] , consistent
with our results.

While YM155 is originally identified as a survivin
inhibitor, its mechanisms of antitumor actions are not fully
understood. Recently, a number of studies have shown that
YM155 could inhibit expression of EGFR, XIAP, Mcl1 [49-51] , suggesting that YM155 function is beyond to
inhibition of survivin. We found that YM155 could inhibit
expansion of gastric CSCs. CSCs are a subpopulation in
tumors that have features to initiate tumor growth, sustain
tumor self-renewal, promote relapse and metastasis by
giving rise to new tumors [52]. However, the roles of
CSCs in tumorigenesis remain in debate [53, 54]. Survivin
is highly expressed in colon CSCs [11] and is upregulated
by interleukin-4 [55]. Mutant APC up-regulates survivin,
causing apoptosis inhibition and the expansion of colon
tissue stem cells in the colon crypt, thereby initiating
tumorigenesis [14, 15]. Survivin has been shown to be
overexpressed in AML stem/progenitor cells [16]. The
data suggested that survivin plays a role in regulation
of CSCs. It is well known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling
is essential for expansion of CSCs [12, 13]. Survivin has
been shown to be a downstream gene of Wnt signaling
pathway [11]. Therefore, survivin is a potential targeting
for inhibition of CSCs. In this study, we observed that
YM155 markedly suppressed formation and expansion
of spheres in gastric cancer cells and downregulated
expression of β-catenin, c-Myc and Cyclin D1, which
are downstream genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. More
importantly, YM155 inhibited CD44 expression in gastric
cancer cells and gastric cancer tissues both in vitro and
in vivo. CD44+ gastric cancer cells is a CSC marker of
human gastric cancer and have stronger tumorigenic than
CD44- gastric cancer cells [17, 18]. Our results, for the
first time, show that YM155 inhibits gastric tumor growth
by inhibition of expansion of CD44+ gastric CSCs.
YM155 has been studied in clinical trial in several
cancer types. In phase I and II studies, YM155 has shown
to be safe and well-tolerated, with a maximum tolerated
dose of 8.0 mg/m2/d. In our xenograft mouse model, a
7-day continuous infusion of YM155 at 5 mg/kg induced
massive tumor regression with decreased expression of
survivin and CD44 in intratumoral. Furthermore, we did
not observe serious side effects in some organisms. The
data document that YM155 is a safety and promising agent
for gastric cancer therapy.

(DMSO) to dissolve formazan production. The absorbance
at wave length 595 nm was measured using micro-ELISA
reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The mean 50% growth
inhibition (IC50) value was calculated by logistic analysis.
The mean IC50 value was obtained from the results of 3
independent assays.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Total RNA from cultured cells was prepared
with RNAprep pure cell kit (Tiangen). First-strand
cDNA was synthesized with oligo (dT) primer by using
PrimeScript® RT reagent Kit (Takara, Daliang, China).
Primer sequences were designed using the Primer
QuestSM and were as follows: human survivin (forward)
5-ATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTGCC-3 and (reverse)
5-TCAATCCATGGCAGCCAG CT-3; human CD44
(forward) 5-AAAGCAGGACCTTCATCCCAGTGA-3
and (reverse) 5-TTGCTCCACCTTCTTGACTCCCAT-3;
human
GAPDH
(forward)
GAAGACTGTGGATGGCCCCT
and
(reverse)
GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGT. PCR was performed
using the PCR Master Mix (Tiangen, China), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Soft agar colony formation assay
Anchorage-independent cell growth was determined
by soft agar clone formation assay. Cells (5 × 102) in 0.5
ml complete culture medium containing 0.3% agar and
YM155 or vehicle were cultured on the top of 0.7% agar
in the same medium. Dishes were then transferred into
culture incubator. Cultures were stained with 0.1% crystal
violet at 16 days, colonies were counted under microscope
(magnification 50 ×). Colonies containing ≥ 50 cells were
considered viable.

In situ detection of apoptotic cells by TUNEL
assay
Cells were harvested and fixed by 0.4%
paraformaldehyde, TUNEL staining was carried out using
In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis,
USA) according to the manufactory manuals. Apoptotic
cells show strong nuclear green fluorescence. The
apoptotic cells were counted in 5 randomly selected fields
viewed at × 20 magnification. The apoptotic index was
calculated as the number of apoptotic cells/total number
of nucleated cells ×100%.

Flow cytometry assay for apoptosis
Cells were collected and washed with cold PBS,
then stained with FITC Annexin V/PI (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, USA ) according to production manuals.
Apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter,
Luton, United Kingdom).

Spheroid colony formation assay
Gastric cancer cells (102 cells per well) were
inoculated in a ultra-low-attachment 96-well plates
(Corning, USA) supplemented with 200 μl of RPMI-1640
medium (Thermo Scientific, China) plus 0.3% albumin
from bovine serum (BSA, Sigma-Alorich, USA), 20 ng/
ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF,
Invitrogen Corp., Frederick, MD, USA) and 10 ng/ml
human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF,
Invitrogen Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). Two weeks after
culture, each well was examined under light microscope
and the total spheroid colonies numbers per well were
counted. The rates of sphere formation were calculated as
the number of apoptotic cells/total number of nucleated
cells 1×100%.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1X PBS,1%
NP40,0.1%
SDS,5mM
EDTA,0.5%
sodium
deoxyccholate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein samples
were electrophoresed in 10% denaturing sodium
dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to
Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA). The blots were incubated with specific primary
antibodies, reacted with a peroxidase-conjugated second
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers,
USA) and then visualized by chemiluminescence HRP

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Gastric cancer xenograft experiment

No potential conflicts of interest.

Five weeks old female BALB/c nude mice were
purchased from Shanghai Experimental Animals Centre
of Chinese Academy of Sciences. All animal studies abode
the rules of The Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of
Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of
Medicine. Xenografts were established by s.c. injection
of SGC 7901 cells into the right flanks of the mice (5×106
/0.1ml per mouse. After one week, tumor size reached
approximately 80 mm3 -100 mm3, mice were randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups. YM155 at 5mg/
kg/day or vehicle control was administered subcutaneously
as a 7-day continuous infusion using a micro-osmotic
pump (Alzet model 1007D) implanted in the left dorsal
flank under anesthesia. Body weight of mice was assessed
twice weekly, and tumor diameter was measured using
standard calipers. After two weeks observation, mice
were sacrificed and tumors were weighed, subsequently
processed for immunohistochemistry and Western Blot.
