ABSTRACT
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in a variety of human epithelial
cancers, including lung cancer, and is highly associated with a poor prognosis and a
low survival rate. Understanding how COX-2 is regulated in response to carcinogens
will offer insight into designing anti-cancer strategies and preventing cancer
development. Here, we analyzed COX-2 expression in several human lung cancer
cell lines and found that COX-2 expression was absent in the H719 and H460 cell
lines by a DNA methylation-independent mechanism. The re-expression of COX-2 was
observed after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment in both cell
lines. Further investigation found that H3K36 dimethylation was significantly reduced
near the COX-2 promoter because histone demethylase 2A (KDM2A) was recruited to
the COX-2 promoter after TPA treatment. In addition, the transcription factor c-Fos
was found to be required to recruit KDM2A to the COX-2 promoter for reactivation of
COX-2 in response to TPA treatment in both the H719 and H460 cell lines. Together,
our data reveal a novel mechanism by which the carcinogen TPA activates COX-2
expression by regulating H3K36 dimethylation near the COX-2 promoter.

a novel strategy that offers significant improvements to
prolong the survival of lung cancer patients.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an isoform of
cyclooxygenase, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the
synthesis of prostaglandins. It is an immediate-early
response gene not expressed in most normal tissues but
can be induced by cytokines, growth factors, phorbol
esters, oncogenes and chemical carcinogens [4–6].
For example, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) was reported to up-regulate the expression of the
COX-2 gene in the human lung cancer cell line A549 [6].

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality in the world. The overall 5-year survival rate is
approximately 15% for lung cancer patients, and this rate
has remained largely unchanged for the last three decades
[1, 2]. Even when this cancer is detected early, up to 50%
of patients with pathologic stage I disease eventually
relapse post-resection, and the median survival is less than
one year [3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find

COX-2 plays a significant role in lung cancer
carcinogenesis, promotion, angiogenesis, invasion and
metastasis [7]; therefore, COX-2 has become an important
target being evaluated for lung cancer therapy and
chemoprevention [8]. Understanding the COX-2 expression
mechanism is therefore important for developing strategies
to prevent and treat lung cancer.
The transcription factors upstream of COX-2, such as
AP-1, p300/CBP and NF-κB, can be activated by a series
of kinase reactions after certain types of stimulation [9, 10].
The Fos family of transcription factors includes c-Fos,
FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2, as well as smaller FosB splice
variants Fos B2 and delta FosB2 [11]. The Fos family genes
encode leucine zipper proteins that can dimerize with Jun
family proteins to form the transcription factor complex
activating protein 1 (AP-1) [12]. c-Fos is a constituent of
the first studied AP-1 protein complexes and is frequently
overexpressed in tumor cells [11, 13]. c-Fos has also been
reported to increase the expression of COX-2 [4], but it is
not clear how c-Fos activates COX-2 expression.
Epigenetic control of cancer-related gene expression
plays a critical role in cancer development [14]. In
mammalian cells, epigenetic modifications of cytosine
residues of the DNA CpG dinucleotide and ε-amino residues
of histones have emerged as the major determinants of
chromatin remodeling and gene transcriptional regulation
[15–17]. Both DNA methylation and histone modifications
coordinate to regulate gene expression. DNA methylation,
which occurs in the CpG islands in the gene promoter
region, is strongly related to gene inactivation [18, 19].
The absence of COX-2 expression is closely correlated
with the DNA methylation of the COX-2 promoter, and
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, can
reactivate the expression of COX-2 [20, 21]. In addition
to DNA methylation, the modification of histones such
as H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 has also been reported to be
an important factor in regulating the expression of COX-2
[17, 22–25]. In contrast to other histone methylation sites,
the effect of H3K36 methylation on COX-2 gene expression
has not been extensively studied. H3K36me2 has been
reported to be enriched in the promoters of both expressed
and silenced genes and thus plays an important role in the
regulation of gene expression [17, 26, 27]. Several lysine
methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases
(KDMs) are involved in H3K36 methylation [28]. For
example, lysine-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A)
(also named JHDM1A) can demethylate H3K36me1/2
[29]. Whether there is a causal relationship between the
enrichment of histone methylation-related enzymes such
as KDM2A on the COX-2 promoter and COX-2 gene
activation is worth investigating.
In this study, we analyzed the COX-2 expression
in several human lung cancer cell lines and found that
the COX-2 gene could be reactivated by TPA without
affecting the DNA methylation status of the COX-2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promoter. H3K36 dimethylation was significantly changed
around the COX-2 promoter after TPA treatment, and the
changes in the H3K36 dimethylation were mediated by
the transcription factor c-Fos, which recruited KDM2A to
the COX-2 promoter.

RESULTS
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)
activates the re-expression of the COX-2 gene
The COX-2 gene is typically silent in most normal
tissues and is overexpressed in many solid tumors,
including lung cancer [7, 30]. To investigate the COX-2
expression status in human lung cancer cell lines, RT-PCR
was performed in H719, H460, H23 and A549 cells. As
shown in Figure 1A, COX-2 expression was absent in H719
and H460 cells but was high in H23 and A549 cells. To
determine whether the COX-2 gene could be re-expressed,
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent
carcinogen, was administered to both the H719 and H460
cell lines. COX-2 expression was reactivated by TPA in a
dose- and time-dependent manner in H719 and H460 cells as
demonstrated by RT-PCR (Figure 1B and 1C). Reactivation
of the COX-2 gene peaked at 4–6 hrs after TPA treatment in
both the H719 and H460 cells (Figure 1B and 1C), which
was consistent with its protein levels as demonstrated by
Western blotting (Figure 1D). These data indicate that
COX-2 can be reactivated by TPA in human lung cancer cells.

TPA reactivates COX-2 expression without
affecting the DNA methylation status of
its promoter but is associated with H3K36
methylation
Because the DNA hypermethylation of the COX-2
promoter is related to COX-2 gene silencing [21], we
assessed the DNA methylation status of this promoter in
the H719, H460, H23 and A549 cell lines. Genomic DNA
from these human lung cancer lines was extracted and
treated with sodium bisulfite for methylation-specific PCR
(MSP) analysis. As shown in Figure 2A, the methylated
band was clearly detected in H719 cells, which indicates
a hypermethylated COX-2 promoter in H719 cells.
Conversely, unmethylated bands were detected in the
H460, H23 and A549 cells (Figure 2A). Remarkably,
the COX-2 gene was absent in H460 cells, but the DNA
methylation status of the COX-2 promoter in this cell line
was unmethylated, which suggests that DNA methylation
might not be related to COX-2 gene expression in H460
cells. To further clarify the effect of DNA methylation on
COX-2 gene expression, the alteration of DNA methylation
status of the COX-2 promoter was assessed before and
after TPA treatment in H719 cells. H719 cells were treated
with TPA (100 ng/mL) for 6 hrs, and the genomic DNA

or after TPA treatment. This result was consistent with the
data obtained from a quantitative real-time PCR for the
ChIP assay (ChIP-qPCR assay) (Supplementary Figure
S1). These results demonstrate that the reactivation of
COX-2 expression induced by TPA does not occur by
altering the DNA methylation status of its promoter.
To investigate whether histone methylation is
involved in the COX-2 reactivation after TPA treatment,
H719 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of TPA for 6 hrs
and harvested to detect the histone methylation levels by
Western blotting. We did not find obvious changes in several
prominent histone methylations, such as H3K4, H3K9,
H3K27, H3K79 or H4K20, before or after TPA treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2). Interestingly, we found that
H3K36me2 was significantly decreased after TPA treatment

was extracted for MSP. Surprisingly, the DNA methylation
status of the COX-2 promoter was unchanged after TPA
treatment as detected by MSP (Figure 2B). Consistently,
this unaltered methylation pattern was also confirmed by
bisulfite sequencing analysis. The methylated CpG levels
within the COX-2 promoter, which contains 18 CpG
dinucleotides, were 62.0% and 60.6% before and after TPA
treatment in H719 cells, respectively (Figure 2C). To clarify
whether TPA treatment induced a change in the binding
activity of methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins
on the COX-2 promoter, a chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay was performed to detect the association
between the MBD proteins and the COX-2 promoter. As
shown in Supplementary Figure S1, there were no obvious
changes in the binding activity of the methyl-CpG binding
domain protein 1 (MBD1) or the methyl-CpG binding

and can thus induce the expression of COX-2 [9, 10].
To explore the effect of the related transcription factors on
COX-2 re-expression during TPA treatment, H719 cells
were treated with TPA at 100 ng/mL for up to 6 hrs and then
harvested to detect the expression of these transcriptional
factors with Western blotting. As shown in Figure 4A, the
protein levels of p300, NF-κB and CEBPβ were not changed
after TPA treatment, but the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun,
both main dimer units of AP-1, increased significantly in H719
cells. The c-Fos protein levels were increased significantly
and reached a peak at 2 hrs after TPA treatment (Figure 4A).
In addition, a qPCR was performed to detect FOS mRNA
levels in H719 cells. The FOS mRNA levels also increased
significantly and reached a peak at 2 hrs after TPA treatment
in H719 cells (Figure 4B). To further clarify the effect of c-Fos
on the expression of COX-2, a ChIP assay was performed to
detect c-Fos binding activity around the COX-2 promoter. As
shown in Figure 4C, c-Fos binding activity around the COX-2
promoter increased dramatically after TPA treatment in H719
cells. In addition, the binding activity of c-Jun around the
COX-2 promoter failed to be detected, which indicates that
c-Jun may not be involved in the COX-2 reactivation in H719
cells (Figure 4C). To confirm whether c-Fos is required for the
reactivation of COX-2, H719 cells were transiently transfected
with a siRNA against FOS or a non-specific siRNA and then
treated with TPA. Cells were harvested and subjected to RTPCR or a ChIP assay. As shown in Figure 4D, the expression
of FOS induced by TPA significantly decreased in cells
transfected with c-Fos siRNA compared with that in the cells
transfected with the non-specific siRNA. In addition, the
decreased H3K36me2 around the COX-2 promoter was almost
completely reversed after TPA treatment in the H719 cells with
FOS expression knockdowned by c-Fos siRNA (Figure 4E).
Additionally, the enriched H3K36me2 at the COX-2 promoter
was decreased by 75.0% in the non-specific siRNA-transfected
H719 cells, whereas the changes in H3K36me2 at the COX2 promoter were largely reversed when FOS was knocked
down by c-Fos siRNA, as demonstrated by ChIP-qPCR assay
(Figure 4E). These data indicate that c-Fos is indispensable
for the histone H3K36me2 down-regulation at the COX-2
promoter and for the reactivation of the expression of COX-2
after TPA treatment.

in H719 cells (Figure 2D). To confirm the H3K36me2
changes upon TPA stimulation, the enrichment of the
H3K36me2 around the COX-2 promoter was evaluated
using a ChIP assay (Figure 2E). As shown in Figure 2E,
H3K36me2 enrichment around the COX-2 promoter
was obviously decreased 4 hrs after TPA treatment as
demonstrated by ChIP and ChIP-qPCR assays. These results
suggest that the changes in the H3K36me2 levels on the
COX-2 promoter may be associated with the transcriptional
reactivation of the COX-2 gene after TPA treatment.

Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A)
is involved in the TPA-induced reactivation
of COX-2
We next searched for the enzymes that might be
involved in the alteration of H3K36me2 after TPA treatment.
H719 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of TPA for up to
6 hrs and were harvested for Western blotting to detect the
levels of H3K36me2 methyltransferases or demethylases.
As shown in Figure 3A, the expression of the demethylases
KDM2A (also called FBXL11) and KDM2B (also called
NDY1) were not obviously changed after the TPA treat­
ment. Additionally, the methyltransferases KMT3A (also
called SETD2) and KMT3B (also called NSD1) and the
demethylases KDM4A (also called JMJD2A) and KDM4B
(also called JMJD2B) were also unchanged in TPA-treated
cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Subsequently, a ChIP
assay was used to detect the binding activity of histone
methyltransferases or demethylases (for which an antibody
was available) around the COX-2 promoter upon TPA
stimulation. As shown in Figure 3B, the KDM2A binding
activity around the COX-2 promoter was significantly
increased in H719 cells and reached a peak at 4 hrs after TPA
treatment. These results indicate that KDM2A may play an
important role in the TPA-induced reactivation of COX-2 by
down-regulating H3K36me2 around the COX-2 promoter. To
further confirm the effect of KDM2A on COX-2 reactivation,
an empty vector or a Flag-KDM2A was transfected into
H719 cells for 48 hrs, followed by treatment with TPA for
6 hrs to detect the H3K36me2 changes by Western blotting.
As shown in Figure 3C, H3K36me2 was obviously decreased
in the Flag-KDM2A-transfected H719 cells, and this decrease
was more noticeable after TPA treatment. Moreover, the
reactivation of COX-2 was also more apparent in the FlagKDM2A-transfected H719 cells after TPA treatment. These
data indicate the important role of KDM2A in the TPAinduced decrease of the H3K36me2 and the reactivation of
COX-2 expression.

c-Fos interacts with KDM2A in vitro and in vivo
To explore the mechanism by which c-Fos regulates
H3K36me2 reduction and its role in the reactivation of
COX-2 after TPA treatment in lung cancer cells, several
demethylases that are involved in histone H3K36me2
demethylation were investigated by Co-IP (Figure 5A).
A Myc-tagged c-Fos and Flag-tagged demethylases,
including KDM2A, KDM4A and KDM4B, were cotransfected into HEK293T cells, and the interaction
between c-Fos and each of these H3K36 demethylases
was assessed. As shown in Figure 5A, KDM2A interacted
with c-Fos, which implies that KDM2A may be the

reactivation after TPA treatment. To confirm this result,
a His-tagged c-Fos protein was expressed in bacteria,
purified and incubated with GST and GST-KDM2A to
investigate whether KDM2A directly interacted with
c-Fos. As shown in Figure 5B, c-Fos showed direct
interactions with GST-KDM2A but not with GST alone.
To further map the regions of c-Fos responsible for its
interaction with KDM2A, fragments representing full
length (FL), N-terminal (aa 1–136), middle (aa 137–200)
and C-terminal (aa 201–381) versions of c-Fos as shown
in Figure 5C were expressed , purified and incubated with

specifically interacted with the FL and middle region

of the interaction between KDM2A and c-Fos after TPA
stimulation. H719 cells were treated with or without TPA

of KDM2A and c-Fos significantly increased after TPA
treatment in H719 cells compared with the non-TPA

H460 cells (Supplementary Figure S4F). In addition, a

to TPA treatment. HEK293T cells were transfected with

that KDM2A directly interacts with c-Fos and that the
increased interaction between KDM2A and c-Fos after
TPA treatment plays a critical role in the reactivation of
the COX-2 gene expression.

c-Fos recruits KDM2A to the COX-2 promoter

DISCUSSION

To explore the effect of the interaction between
KDM2A and c-Fos in cancer cells after TPA treatment,
KDM2A expression was down-regulated by KDM2A siRNA
(Figure 6A) to test the binding activity of c-Fos to the COX-2
promoter. H719 cells were treated with TPA after transient
transfection with KDM2A siRNA or a non-specific siRNA
for 48 hrs, and the cells were then harvested and subjected
to a ChIP assay. As shown in Figure 6B, c-Fos was enriched
on the COX-2 promoter by TPA treatment, which was not
dependent on the presence of KDM2A. By contrast, the
enrichment of KDM2A around the COX-2 promoter was
significantly reduced when FOS was knockdowned. As
shown in Figure 6C, the enrichment of KDM2A around the
COX-2 promoter in non-specific siRNA-transfected cells was
significantly increased after TPA treatment compared with that
in the c-Fos siRNA-transfected H719 cells. The enrichment
of KDM2A around the COX-2 promoter was reduced by
71.0% after TPA treatment in c-Fos siRNA-transfected cells
compared with that in the non-specific siRNA-transfected
H719 cells, as assayed by ChIP-qPCR (Figure 6C). These
results indicate that c-Fos reactivates COX-2 expression by
recruiting KDM2A to the COX-2 promoter, which in turn
decreases H3K36me2 around the COX-2 promoter.

In this study, our data reveal a novel mechanism
by which the carcinogen TPA activates the expression of
COX-2 in human lung cancer cells. Histone demethylation
at H3K36me2, but not DNA demethylation around the
promoter of COX-2, is critical for the TPA-induced
reactivation of COX-2. In addition, the transcription
factor c-Fos plays an important role in the TPA-mediated
reduction of histone H3K36 dimethylation by recruiting the
H3K36 demethylase KDM2A onto the COX-2 promoter.
Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the response
to a variety of environmental carcinogen exposures, yet
the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are not well
understood. Aberrant DNA methylation of the COX-2
CpG islands was first reported in colorectal tumors [31],
and DNA hypermethylation of COX-2 at its promoter was
shown to be related to COX-2 gene silencing [20, 21].
However, in this study, DNA methylation was not changed
before or after TPA treatment, showing that TPA-induced
COX-2 gene re-expression is independent of DNA
methylation (Figure 2B). This finding is not so surprising,
considering that TPA is not a demethylation agent, such as
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. When H719 cells were treated with

5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, COX-2 expression was reactivated
in a DNA methylation-dependent manner (Supplementary
Figure S5A and S5B). Also, the enrichment of H3K36me2
around the COX-2 promoter was obviously decreased after
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment as detected by ChIPqPCR assay, suggesting that H3K36me2 demethylation
around the COX-2 promoter plays some role in COX-2
re-expression in H719 cells (Supplementary Figure S5C).
However, whether the re-expression of COX-2 after 5-aza2′-deoxycytidine treatment is exclusively due to histone
demethylation or DNA demethylation needs further
exploration. The re-expression of COX-2 induced by TPA
or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine may occur through different
mechanisms, and TPA reactivates COX-2 mainly by a
c-Fos- and KDM2A-mediated decrease of H3K36me2.
In addition to DNA methylation, histone modifica­
tion is a critical epigenetic regulator that helps control
chromatin structure and gene regulation [32]. Among histone
modifications, histone methylation-mediated gene regulation
has been well studied [32, 33]. The histone methylation of
H3K4 and H3K79 plays a role in activating gene expression,
whereas the methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 has been
suggested to be a gene repressor in euchromatin [15, 32].
H3K36 methylation was reported to play dual functions in
gene expression; studies in multiple systems have supported a
role for H3K36 methylation in transcriptional activation [34,
35]. The levels and spatial distribution of di- and tri-H3K36
methylation in several genes have been analyzed, which
showed that the active genes contain high levels of di- and
tri- H3K36 methylation in actively transcribed regions [34].
Human epigenetic analysis also showed that the gene bodies
of actively transcribed genes are associated with H3K36me3
[35]. By contrast, the effect of H3K36 methylation on
transcriptional repression has also been reported [27, 36–
38]. Set2 is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that is sitespecific for lysine 36 (Lys36) in the H3 tail. Set2 represses
the basal expression of GAL4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by
mediating the methylation form of H3K36 [36]. H3K36me2
has been reported to recruit histone demethylase complex
Rpd3s, which is one of the strong gene repression factors
that represses spurious transcription [37]. In addition, the
epigenetic inactivation of the histone methyltransferase
NSD1 leads to the specifically diminished methylation
of the histone lysine residues H3K36 and increases the
expression of oncogene MEIS1 in human neuroblastoma
and glioma [38]. In our study, we found that H3K36me2
was reduced both in the promoter and the transcribed regions
of the COX-2 gene, indicating that H3K36me2 might play
an important role in gene repression by mediating the
transcriptional reactivation of COX-2 in human lung cancer
cells (Figure 2D and 2E, Supplementary Figure S4A and
S4B, and Supplementary Figure S6A and S6B). In addition,
the changes of H3K36me3 in the transcribed region of the
COX-2 gene were detected by ChIP-qPCR assay, and no
significant increased H3K36me3 enrichment was found in
each exon of the COX-2 gene, suggesting that H3K36me3 is
not related to the increased expression of COX-2 in response
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to TPA treatment (Supplementary Figure S6C). Thus,
H3K36 methylation appears to act as both an activating and
an inhibitory signal, and the overall biological readout may
depend on the context of the additional surrounding markers
and their corresponding reader proteins.
H3K36 is methylated by lysine methyltransferases
and demethylated by lysine demethylases, including
KDM2A [28, 39]. KDM2A is a JmjC-containing histone
demethylase that targets mono- and dimethylated Lys36
on H3 residues. In lung cancer, KDM2A was reported
to be a novel oncogenic promoter of non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and the overexpression of KDM2A
was shown to promote tumorigenicity and metastasis
by epigenetically enhancing ERK1/2 signaling in
NSCLC [40]. KDM2A expression was found to be
increased in gastric cancer tissues, and KDM2A may
regulate the growth and motility of gastric cancer cells
by down-regulating the expression of tumor suppressor
programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) in the progression of
gastric cancer [41]. Conversely, KDM2A was found to
regulate E2F1-mediated gene transcription and thus to
suppress the invasion and migration in breast cancer cells
[42]. Silencing KDM2A using small interfering RNAs
increased the invasion and migration of breast cancer
cells by suppressing a subset of matrix metalloproteinases,
such as MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-4 and MMP-15 [42]. In
our study, the enrichment of KDM2A around the COX-2
promoter was significantly increased after TPA treatment,
which indicates that KDM2A is involved in the TPAinduced reactivation of the COX-2 gene (Figure 3B
and 3C). KDM2A may reactivate the expression of COX-2
gene by decreasing H3K36me2 near the COX-2 promoter
in human lung cancer cells.
Chromatin-modifying enzymes function as cofactors and are frequently recruited by transcription
factors to chromatin to activate or repress gene expression.
Our data show that c-Fos was indispensable for histone
H3K36me2 changes at the COX-2 promoter by recruiting
KDM2A to the COX-2 promoter and reactivating COX-2
expression after TPA treatment in both H719 and H460
cells (Figure 4–6 and Supplementary Figure S4C–S4G).
The effects of c-Fos on histone modification have also
been found in the regulation of other genes [43, 44]. c-Fos
induced SIRT6 transcription, which repressed survivin by
reducing histone H3K9 acetylation and NF-κB activation
[43]. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which
is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, could
effectively increase the expression of microRNA-29b
through the activation of c-Fos expression. Decreased
methylation at H3K9 in response to oxLDL was
significantly abolished in the absence of c-Fos, which
implies that oxLDL-mediated histone modifications are
mediated through the activation of c-Fos, which eventually
causes miR-29b up-regulation [44]. These results are
similar to our data showing that c-Fos is an important
transcription factor for gene regulation through mediating
histone modification. Also, several co-downstreams of

both COX-2 and c-Fos were identified after TPA treatment
in H460 cells. The expression of mPGES-1 and EP2 is
significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after
TPA treatment, which is similar with the pattern of COX-2
expression under the same conditions. These data suggest
that the COX-2—mPGES-1—EP2 pathway was activated
in response to TPA treatment (Supplementary Figure S7A).
Among the downstreams of c-Fos, we found that the
expression pattern of VEGF was same as the expression
pattern of c-FOS, while an opposite expression pattern
was found in the expression of p27 after TPA stimulation
(Supplementary Figure S7B). Interestingly, the expression
of MMP1 was constantly increased in a dose-dependent
manner after TPA treatment, suggesting that MMP1 may
be another gene activated by TPA through c-Fos.
To our knowledge, this is the first report showing
that transcription factor c-Fos mediates the TPA-induced
COX-2 reactivation by recruiting KDM2A to the COX-2
promoter in human lung cancer cells. Based on the above
observations, we propose a mechanism to explain the
effect of TPA on COX-2 gene reactivation (Figure 6D).
TPA directly induces the expression of c-Fos and thus
enriches c-Fos around the COX-2 promoter. Subsequently,
c-Fos recruits KDM2A to the COX-2 promoter, which
further decreases the H3K36me2 levels on the COX-2
promoter. Consequently, COX-2 is reactivated by TPA.
Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which TPA
activates the expression of COX-2 and provide a new
target for designing anti-cancer strategies and preventing
lung cancer development.

PCR products were gel extracted with a Qiaquick gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into
the pGEM-T easy vector by using the TA cloning system
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Ttransformed Escherichia coli
DH5α cells were cultured overnight, and the plasmid DNA

separate clones were chosen for sequence analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and chemical treatment

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Human lung cancer cell lines H719, H460, H23
and A549 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). H460 and H23 cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). H719
cells were cultured in DMEM: F12 medium with 5%
heat-inactivated FBS. A549 cells were cultured in F-12K
medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All the cells were
cultured in the medium mentioned above with penicillin/
streptomycin in a 37°C incubator with a humidified, 5%
CO2 atmosphere. All cells obtained from ATCC were
immediately expanded and frozen down for future use
(every 3 months from a frozen vial) of the same batch
of cells. Chemical reagents 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA) was purchased from Sigma (St Louis,
MO, USA). TPA (dissolved in DMSO) was fresh added
in medium and then incubated at 37°C for various time
intervals. Control cells were treated with dimethyl
sulfoxide for similar time intervals. The final concentration
of added DMSO was lower than 0.1% (V/V).
