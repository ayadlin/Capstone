of polyphenols, multiple lines of evidence indicate the healthpromoting effects of resveratrol (3,5,4¶-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene),
which is a nonflavonoid compound present in red wine. Previous
studies reported that resveratrol exerted antitumor effects through
the activation of p53-mediated apoptosis (3) and inhibited
cyclooxygenase-2 expression and two-stage skin cancer induced
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in mouse skin (4).
However, the concentration of resveratrol required for achieving its
beneficial effects is unlikely to be attained through a moderate
consumption of red wine due to its low content of resveratrol. The
resveratrol content in red wine [0.6–6.8 mg/L in French red wines
(5)] is f30 times lower than the flavonol content, with one of the
major flavonols in red wine being quercetin (3,3¶,4¶,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone; ref. 6). Quercetin has been suggested as a potent
anticarcinogenic flavonol. In 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene–
initiated and TPA-promoted two-stage mouse skin cancer models,
quercetin exerted the strongest anticarcinogenic effects (7). Thus,
the identification of the actual active components responsible for
the chemopreventive effects of red wine and molecular mechanism(s) of action is needed.
Activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) act as
pivotal transcription factors involving neoplastic transformation
and development of cancer (8–11) and are regulated by upstream
kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling pathways. MAPK signaling pathways are commonly upregulated in various cancer cell types, and these pathways are
involved in cell proliferation and survival (12). Among the
components of the MAPK pathways, the MAPK kinase kinase
(Raf)/MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase
(MEK)/ERK cascade has been the focus of cancer chemotherapy
because of its relevance in carcinogenesis. A variety of tumor
promoters, including TPA and epidermal growth factor (EGF), are
known to induce neoplastic transformation through activation of
the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in various cell lines (8, 13, 14). The Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway has also been identified as a key downstream
effector of Ras, which is a frequently mutated oncogene in 30%
or more of human cancers (15, 16). This pathway plays a critical
role in linking extracellular signals associated with Ras activation
to nuclear transcription events (17). Because aberrant activation of
ERK has been shown in various types of tumors (18, 19), the
targeted down-regulation of ERK through the inhibition of
upstream kinases, such as Raf or MEK, is an effective method for
intervening in carcinogenesis.
The JB6 mouse epidermal cell system, including promotionsensitive (P+) and promotion-resistant (P ) components, is
regarded as an appropriate model for studying tumor promoter–
induced carcinogenic processes at the molecular level. The present

Abstract
Considerable attention has focused on the health-promoting
effects of red wine and its nonflavonoid polyphenol compound
resveratrol. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms
and molecular target(s) of red wine or other potentially active
ingredients in red wine remain unknown. Here, we report
that red wine extract (RWE) or the red wine flavonoid quercetin inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)induced transformation of JB6 promotion-sensitive mouse
skin epidermal (JB6 P+) cells. The activation of activator
protein-1 and nuclear factor-KB induced by TPA was dose
dependently inhibited by RWE or quercetin treatment.
Western blot and kinase assay data revealed that RWE or
quercetin inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1 and
Raf1 kinase activities and subsequently attenuated TPAinduced phosphorylation of ERK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase.
Although either RWE or quercetin suppressed Raf1 kinase
activity, they were more effective in inhibiting MEK1 activity.
Importantly, quercetin exerted stronger inhibitory effects than
PD098059, a well-known pharmacologic inhibitor of MEK.
Resveratrol did not affect either MEK1 or Raf1 kinase activity.
Pull-down assays revealed that RWE or quercetin (but not
resveratrol) bound with either MEK1 or Raf1. RWE or
quercetin also dose dependently suppressed JB6 P+ cell
transformation induced by epidermal growth factor or
H-Ras, both of which are involved in the activation of MEK/
ERK signaling. Docking data suggested that quercetin, but not
resveratrol, formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide
group of Ser212, which is the key interaction for stabilizing the
inactive conformation of the activation loop of MEK1. [Cancer

Inhibition of MEK and Raf Activity by Quercetin
Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L EDTA], and the luciferase activity
was measured using a luminometer (Luminoskan Ascent, Thermo
Electron).
Western blot analysis. After the cells (1.5  106) were cultured in a
10-cm dish for 48 h, they were starved in serum-free medium for an
additional 24 h. The cells were then treated with RWE (0–20 Ag/mL) or
quercetin (0–20 Amol/L) for 1 h before they were exposed to 20 ng/mL TPA
for an additional 30 min. The harvested cells were disrupted and the
supernatant fractions were boiled for 5 min. The protein concentration was
determined using a dye-binding protein assay kit as described in the
manufacturer’s manual. Lysate protein (20 Ag) was subjected to 10% SDSPAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. After blotting, the membrane was incubated with the specific
primary antibody at 4jC overnight. Protein bands were visualized by a
chemiluminescence detection kit after hybridization with a horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody.
In vitro MEK1 and Raf1 assays. The in vitro kinase assays were
performed in accordance with the instructions provided by Upstate
Biotechnology. In brief, every reaction contained 20 AL of assay dilution
buffer [20 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mmol/L h-glycerol phosphate,
5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L DTT] and
a magnesium-ATP cocktail buffer. For MEK1, 1 Ag of the inactive ERK2
substrate peptide was also included. For Raf1, 0.4 Ag of inactive MEK1
and 1 Ag of inactive ERK2 were included. A 4-AL aliquot was removed
from the reaction mixture, containing 20 Ag of MBP substrate peptide
and 10 AL of diluted [g-32P]ATP solution, and incubated at 30jC for
30 min. This mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30jC, and then 25 AL
aliquots were transferred onto p81 filter paper and washed thrice with
0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash and once with acetone for
2 min. The radioactive incorporation was determined using a scintillation
counter (LS6500; Beckman Coulter). Each experiment was performed
thrice.
Ex vivo MEK1 and Raf1 immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. JB6
P+ cells were cultured to 80% confluence and then serum starved in 0.1%
FBS/MEM for 24 h at 37jC. Cells were either treated or not treated with
RWE, quercetin, or resveratrol for 1 h and then treated with 20 ng/mL TPA
for 30 min, disrupted with lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
1 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton
X-100, 1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 mg/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)], and finally
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The lysates, each
containing 500 Ag of protein, were used for immunoprecipitation with an
antibody against MEK1 or Raf1 and then incubated at 4jC overnight.
Protein A/G Plus agarose beads were then added and the mixture was
continuously rotated for an additional 3 h at 4jC. The beads were washed
thrice with kinase buffer [20 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mmol/L h-glycerol
phosphate, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L
DTT] and then resuspended in 20 AL of 1 kinase buffer supplemented with
1 Ag of inactive ERK2 ( for MEK1) or with 0.4 Ag of inactive MEK1 and 1 Ag
of inactive ERK2 ( for Raf1) and incubated for an additional 30 min at 30jC.
Then, MBP (20 Ag) and 10 AL of diluted [g-32P]ATP solution were added and
the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30jC. A 20-AL aliquot was
transferred onto p81 filter paper and washed thrice with 0.75% phosphoric
acid for 5 min per wash and once with acetone for 2 min. The radioactive
incorporation was determined using a scintillation counter. Each experiment was performed thrice.
In vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays. Recombinant MEK1 (2 Ag; or
Raf1) or a JB6 P+ cellular supernatant fraction (500 Ag protein) was
incubated with the RWE-Sepharose 4B or quercetin-Sepharose 4B
(or Sepharose 4B as control) beads (100 AL, 50% slurry) in reaction buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 0.01% NP40, 2 Ag/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mmol/L PMSF,
1 protease inhibitor mixture]. After incubation with gentle rocking
overnight at 4jC, the beads were washed five times with buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L DTT,
0.01% NP40, 0.02 mmol/L PMSF], and proteins bound to the beads were
analyzed by immunoblotting.

study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of the antitumorigenic
effects of red wine and to identify potentially effective compounds
by investigating the possible inhibitory effects of red wine extract
(RWE), quercetin, or resveratrol on TPA-induced neoplastic
transformation of JB6 P+ cells. Here, we report that RWE or
quercetin, but not resveratrol, is a potent inhibitor of MEK1
activity. The inhibition of MEK1 suppressed downstream ERK
phosphorylation and activation of AP-1 and NF-nB, which
subsequently inhibited neoplastic transformation. RWE or quercetin also inhibited Raf1 activity, but this was less substantial than
the inhibition of MEK1.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Quercetin, resveratrol, EGF, and TPA were obtained from
Sigma Chemical; Eagle’s MEM, basal medium Eagle (BME), gentamicin, and
L-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies; and fetal bovine serum
(FBS) was purchased from Gemini Bio-Products. PD098059 and GW5074
were obtained from Calbiochem. The antibodies against phosphorylated
MEK (Ser217/221), phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), total ERK, phosphorylated p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK; Thr359/Ser363), p90RSK, phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; Thr183/Tyr185), and total JNK were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibodies against total
MEK and Raf1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The MEK1 and Raf1
kinase assay kits were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. CNBrSepharose 4B, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, [g-32P]ATP, and the chemiluminescence detection kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
and the protein assay kit was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. G418
and the luciferase assay substrate were purchased from Promega.
Preparation of RWE. RWE was kindly provided by Dr. Schini-Kerth
(Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France). The procedure used to
prepare RWE has been described previously (20). In brief, phenolic
compounds were adsorbed onto a preparative column, the alcohol was
desorbed, the alcoholic eluent was gently evaporated, and finally the
concentrated residue was lyophilized and finely sprayed to obtain RWE dry
powder.
Cell culture. The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal (JB6 P+) and H-Ras–
transformed JB6 P+ (H-Ras JB6 P+) cell lines were cultured in monolayers at
37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator in MEM containing 5% FBS, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, and 25 Ag/mL gentamicin. The JB6 mouse epidermal cell
line was stably transfected with an AP-1 or NF-nB luciferase reporter
plasmid and maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS containing
200 Ag/mL G418.
Anchorage-independent cell transformation assay. The effects of
RWE and red wine compounds on TPA- or EGF-induced cell transformation
were investigated in JB6 P+ cells. Cells (8  103/mL) were exposed to TPA or
EGF with or without RWE and red wine compounds in 1 mL of 0.33% BME
agar containing 10% FBS or in 3.5 mL of 0.5% BME agar containing 10%
FBS. The effects of RWE and red wine compounds on H-Ras–induced
cell transformation were investigated in H-Ras–transformed JB6 cells. The
H-Ras cells (8  103/mL) were incubated with or without RWE or red wine
compounds in 1 mL of 0.33% BME agar containing 10% FBS or in 3.5 mL of
0.5% BME agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained at 37jC
in a 5% CO2 incubator for 14 days, after which the cell colonies were
counted under a microscope with the aid of the Image-Pro Plus software
program (version 4; Media Cybernetics; ref. 21).
Luciferase assay for AP-1 and NF-KB transactivation. AP-1 or NF-nB
luciferase reporter JB6 P+ cells (8  103), suspended in 100 AL of 5% FBS/
MEM, were added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. When cells reached 80% to 90%
confluence, they were starved by culturing in 0.1% FBS MEM for an
additional 24 h. The cells were then treated for 1 h with RWE (0–40 Ag/mL),
quercetin (0–40 Amol/L), or resveratrol (0–40 Amol/L) and then exposed
to 20 ng/mL TPA for 24 h. After treatment, cells were disrupted with
100 AL of lysis buffer [0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1%

Figure 1. Effects of RWE on TPA-induced
neoplastic transformation and AP-1 and
NF-nB transactivation in JB6 P+ cells.
A, RWE inhibited TPA-induced JB6 P+ cell
transformation. JB6 P+ cells were treated
as described in Materials and Methods
and colonies were counted 14 d later:
untreated control (a), TPA alone (b),
TPA and 5 Ag/mL RWE (c ), TPA and
10 Ag/mL RWE (d ), TPA and 20 Ag/mL
RWE (e ), and TPA and 40 Ag/mL RWE (f ).
B, cell colonies were counted under a

on neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+
cells are presented as the percent inhibition
of cell transformation compared with
cells treated only with TPA in soft agar.
Columns, mean of the percent inhibition

experiments; bars, SD. C and D, RWE
inhibited TPA-induced AP-1 (C) or NF-nB

were stably transfected with AP-1 or
NF-nB luciferase reporter plasmids, were
pretreated with RWE for 1 h at the indicated
concentrations (5, 10, 20, or 40 Ag/mL)
followed by exposure to 20 ng/mL TPA for
24 h. The relative activity was measured

measured AP-1 and NF-nB transactivation by using JB6 P+ cells
stably transfected with an AP-1 or NF-nB luciferase reporter
plasmid. RWE inhibited TPA-induced transactivation of either AP-1
or NF-nB in a dose-dependent manner, and treatment with RWE at
a low concentration inhibited AP-1 more effectively compared with
NF-nB (Fig. 1C and D, respectively).
RWE suppresses TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK,
ERK, and p90RSK in JB6 P+ cells. Among the kinases belonging
to the MAPK family, ERK has been reported to be the most
important in TPA-induced JB6 P+ cell transformation (9, 24, 25).
We next examined whether RWE down-regulates ERK and JNK
pathways stimulated by TPA in JB6 P+ cells. RWE at 5 Ag/mL
inhibited TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK but more strongly
suppressed phosphorylation of the MEK downstream kinases ERK
and p90RSK (Fig. 2A). RWE, at 20 Ag/mL, slightly inhibited TPAinduced JNK phosphorylation but to a much lower degree than
ERK (data not shown). These results suggested that the inhibition
of the MEK/ERK/p90RSK signal pathway by RWE leads to the
suppression of AP-1 and NF-nB, resulting in decreased neoplastic
transformation.
RWE inhibits MEK1 activity more strongly than Raf1
activity. We next investigated the effects of RWE on the kinase
activity of MEK1 and Raf1. Kinase assay data revealed that RWE
inhibited MEK1 activity more strongly than Raf1 activity (Fig. 2B).
RWE at 0.5 Ag/mL blocked active MEK1 activity by 53.2%, whereas
it had no effect on active Raf1 activity. In vitro MEK1 activity was
completely inhibited by RWE at or above 5 Ag/mL, whereas
treatment with 5 Ag/mL RWE reduced Raf1 activity by only 24.9%

Results
RWE inhibits TPA-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6
P+ cells. To investigate whether red wine exerts health-promoting
effects by intervening in carcinogenesis processes, we first
examined the effect of RWE on neoplastic transformation. Results
indicated that treatment with RWE markedly inhibited TPApromoted neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1A). Based on the numbers of cell colonies,
RWE at only 5 Ag/mL suppressed TPA-induced JB6 P+ cell
transformation by 59% and, at or above 20 Ag/mL, almost
completely prevented transformation (Fig. 1B).
RWE inhibits TPA-induced AP-1 and NF-KB transactivation
in JB6 P+ cells. AP-1 and NF-nB are major transcription factors
involved in TPA-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells
(22–24). To investigate whether RWE down-regulates cell transformation through the inhibition of these transcription factors, we

was detected. However, at the highest concentration, RWE
effectively suppressed either MEK1 or Raf1 activity stimulated by

an ex vivo kinase assay also revealed that RWE inhibited TPAinduced MEK1 activity in JB6 P+ cells more than Raf1 activity. RWE

TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and p90RSK in JB6 P+ cells. JB6 P+ cells were treated with RWE (5, 10, or 20 Ag/mL) for 1 h before being stimulated by
20 ng/mL TPA for an additional 15 min. The cells were lysed and the levels of phosphorylated and total MEK, ERK, and p90RSK proteins were determined by
Western blot analysis as described in Materials and Methods using specific antibodies against the respective phosphorylated and total proteins. Data are representative
of three independent experiments that gave similar results. p-MEK, phosphorylated MEK; p-ERK, phosphorylated ERK; p-p90RSK, phosphorylated p90RSK.

Materials and Methods, and the kinase activity is expressed as the percent inhibition relative to the activity of untreated MEK1 or Raf1 control. For the ex vivo MEK1 or
Raf1 kinase assay, cells were pretreated with RWE at the indicated concentrations (1, 5, 10, or 20 Ag/mL) for 1 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/mL TPA for
30 min. Cells were harvested, and immunoprecipitation and an ex vivo MEK1 or Raf1 kinase assay was performed. The kinase activity is expressed as the percent
inhibition relative to cells treated with TPA only. The average 32P count was determined from three separate experiments. Points, mean; bars, SD. For in vitro
kinase assays, the asterisk (*) indicates a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in kinase activity between the groups treated with active MEK1 (or Raf1) and RWE together

resveratrol did not inhibit either kinase
activity. An in vitro MEK1 (left ) or Raf1

described in Materials and Methods,
and the kinase activity is expressed as the

performed twice and representative
blots are shown. D, quercetin inhibited
TPA-induced ERK phosphorylation but had
no effect on MEK phosphorylation in JB6
P+ cells. JB6 P+ cells were treated with
quercetin at the indicated concentrations
(5, 10, or 20 Amol/L) for 1 h before
being stimulated by 20 ng/mL TPA for an
additional 15 min. The cells were lysed and
the levels of phosphorylated and total
ERK and MEK proteins were determined
by Western blot analysis as described in
Materials and Methods using specific
antibodies against the respective
phosphorylated and total proteins. Data are
representative of three independent
experiments that gave similar results.

MEK1 or Raf1 activities by RWE occurs through direct binding of
RWE with either protein.
Quercetin inhibits MEK1 activity more strongly than Raf1
activity, whereas resveratrol has no inhibitory effect on either
kinase. To elucidate the active components of RWE contributing
to its chemopreventive effects, we next examined the effects of
quercetin or resveratrol (Fig. 3A) on MEK1 and Raf1 kinase
activities. Similar to RWE, quercetin inhibited MEK1 activity more
effectively compared with inhibition of Raf1 activity, whereas
resveratrol had no inhibitory effect on either kinase (Fig. 3B).
MEK1 kinase assay revealed that quercetin at 5 Amol/L almost
completely blocked MEK1 activity, and the effect was greater than
the inhibition by PD098059, a specific MEK inhibitor. Furthermore,
resveratrol at up to 20 Amol/L exerted no effect on MEK1 activity
(Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, quercetin inhibited Raf1 activity by only
23.8% at 10 Amol/L, and resveratrol at up to 10 Amol/L exerted no

cell transformation by RWE was mainly caused by the suppression
of MEK1 activity and to a lesser extent by inhibition of Raf1 and its
downstream signaling pathways.
RWE directly binds with either MEK1 or Raf1. To determine
whether the inhibition of MEK1 and Raf1 kinase activities by RWE
was caused by a direct interaction, we next performed pull-down
assays. Using an in vitro pull-down assay, MEK1 was found in the
RWE-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 2C, left) but not in Sepharose 4B
beads alone (Fig. 2C, left). We also observed ex vivo binding
between RWE and MEK1 in JB6 P+ cell lysates (Fig. 2C, right).
Because RWE could also inhibit Raf1 activity, we performed in vitro
pull-down assays to determine whether RWE directly interacts with
Raf1. Raf1 was found in the RWE-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 2D, left)
but not in Sepharose 4B beads alone (Fig. 2D, left). As for MEK, we
also observed ex vivo binding of RWE and Raf1 in JB6 P+ cell
lysates (Fig. 2D, right). These results suggested that the inhibition of

effect (Fig. 3B, right). GW5074, a well-known inhibitor of Raf1, was
used as a positive control.
To further determine whether quercetin directly binds with
MEK1 or Raf1, we performed in vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays.
MEK1 was found in the quercetin-Sepharose 4B beads but not in
Sepharose 4B beads alone (Fig. 3C, top left). We also observed
ex vivo binding of quercetin and MEK1 in JB6 P+ cell lysates
(Fig. 3C, top right). In addition, Raf1 was found in the quercetinSepharose 4B beads but not in Sepharose 4B beads alone (Fig. 3C,
bottom left). We also observed ex vivo binding of quercetin and Raf1
in JB6 P+ cell lysates (Fig. 3C, bottom right).
Western blot analysis confirmed that quercetin inhibited TPAinduced ERK phosphorylation, whereas quercetin had no effect on
TPA-induced MEK phosphorylation in JB6 P+ cells (Fig. 3D). This is
consistent with the previous result showing that quercetin blocked
MEK1 activity more effectively than Raf1 activity. In addition,
quercetin (at up to 20 Amol/L) had no effect on TPA-induced
phosphorylation of JNK in JB6 P+ cells (data not shown). These
results indicated that quercetin interacts with MEK1 and Raf1
protein kinases and results in down-regulation of their kinase
activities. Of note, MEK is a more important target molecule of
quercetin for the suppression of TPA-induced JB6 P+ cell
transformation.
Quercetin inhibits TPA-induced neoplastic transformation
and transactivation of AP-1 and NF-KB in JB6 P+ cells, whereas
resveratrol had no effect. To confirm that inhibition of the Raf/
MEK/ERK signaling pathway by quercetin leads to the suppression
of neoplastic transformation, we next examined the effects of
quercetin on TPA-induced JB6 P+ cell transformation and transactivation of AP-1 and NF-nB. Treatment with quercetin markedly
inhibited TPA-promoted neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Based on the numbers of
cell colonies, quercetin at 40 Amol/L almost completely suppressed
TPA-induced neoplastic transformation, whereas resveratrol at up
to 40 Amol/L had no effect. To determine whether the blocking of
transformation by quercetin involves the inhibition of AP-1 or
NF-nB activity, we measured AP-1 and NF-nB transactivation.
Quercetin suppressed TPA-induced transactivation of either AP-1
or NF-nB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B and C). Although
resveratrol at 40 Amol/L slightly inhibited TPA-induced AP-1 or
NF-nB activity, this inhibition might have been insufficient to
suppress TPA-induced transformation. PD098059 and GW5074
were used as positive controls, and the inhibitory effect of
quercetin was greater than that of PD098059 for treatment at the
same concentration.
RWE or quercetin inhibits H-Ras–induced or EGF-induced
neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells, whereas resveratrol
has no effect. Because H-Ras or EGF acts as a potent activator of
the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway leading to neoplastic
transformation in JB6 P+ cells (9, 26, 27), we next examined
whether RWE, quercetin, or resveratrol could inhibit H-Ras–
induced or EGF-induced JB6 P+ cell transformation. RWE at
20 Ag/mL suppressed H-Ras–induced or EGF-induced neoplastic
transformation by 87.1% and 91.2%, respectively (Fig. 5A and B,
respectively). Based on the number of cell colonies, quercetin at
20 Amol/L blocked H-Ras–induced or EGF-induced cell transformation by 94.7% or 66.31%, respectively (Fig. 5C and D,
respectively), and this ability was significantly better than or
similar to that of PD098059 or GW5074 at the same concentration,
respectively. Consistent with other results, resveratrol at up to
20 Amol/L had no significant effect on H-Ras–induced or

the underlying mechanisms and molecular targets remain unclear.
In the present study, we found that RWE inhibited TPA-induced
neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells. Previous studies have
focused on the critical role of AP-1 in regulating transformation of
JB6 P+ cells because blocking of AP-1 activity by phytochemicals is
linked to the suppression of JB6 P+ cell transformation (11, 25, 30).
However, other studies have shown that NF-nB activation is also
required for TPA-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells

Inhibition of MEK and Raf Activity by Quercetin

strong inhibition of neoplastic transformation of RWE. Further,
in vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays revealed that RWE bound
with either MEK1 or Raf1, which may contribute to the observed
reduced kinase activities of MEK1 and Raf1.
The identification of the actual active components responsible
for the chemopreventive effects of red wine and elucidation of the
molecular mechanism(s) of action are needed. The present study
compared the effects of resveratrol and quercetin and results
indicated that quercetin inhibited MEK1 and Raf1 activities,
whereas resveratrol at up to 20 Amol/L had no effect. Quercetin
inhibited MEK1 activity more efficiently than Raf1 activity. Of note,
quercetin was more effective than PD098059 for inhibiting MEK1
activity. Quercetin inhibited MEK1 and Raf1 activities through
direct binding with each protein and blocking of MEK1 activity
inhibited TPA-induced ERK phosphorylation in JB6 P+ cells.
Interestingly, however, the TPA-induced MEK phosphorylation
was not suppressed by quercetin, although quercetin slightly
blocked Raf1 activity. These results suggested the presence of a
negative feedback loop in MEK regulation. Other investigators have
found that inhibition of MEK activity by PD184352 elevated MEK
phosphorylation because the binding of PD184352 prevents the
catalytic activity of MEK but still allows the phosphorylation of
Ser218 and Ser222 (37). Therefore, because quercetin strongly
inhibited MEK1 kinase activity, phosphorylation of MEK would
not change in spite of the slight inhibition of Raf1 activity by
quercetin. Quercetin, but not resveratrol, inhibited TPA-induced
AP-1 and NF-nB activation by suppressing the MEK/ERK, but not
the JNK, pathway, subsequently leading to the suppression of
neoplastic transformation. Further investigation revealed that
RWE or quercetin suppressed not only TPA-induced but also

(22, 23). Interestingly, a close interaction of c-Fos or c-Jun (AP-1
subunits) with p65 (a NF-nB subunit) has been reported (22). These
findings suggest that inhibiting both or either transcription factor
effectively suppresses neoplastic transformation. Our results
showed that RWE inhibited TPA-induced activation of both AP-1
and NF-nB in JB6 P+ cells.
Transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-nB are regulated
mainly by MAPKs (31, 32). Previous studies have shown the
importance of the involvement of ERK in JB6 P+ cell transformation. In contrast to P+ cells, P cells do not respond to tumor
promoters, and this was shown to be due to low levels of
phosphorylated and total ERK proteins (9). The ERK signaling
pathway involves Raf, MEK, ERK, and p90RSK proteins (33, 34). In
this study, RWE inhibited TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK,
ERK, and p90RSK in JB6 P+ cells, and this inhibition of the ERK
pathway led to the suppression of neoplastic transformation
through the inhibition of AP-1 and NF-nB. RWE was more effective
at inhibiting MEK1 activity than Raf1 activity, which is consistent
with the above results. A strong inhibition of MEK1 activity
resulted in RWE being very effective at suppressing phosphorylation of ERK due to this being a downstream effector kinase of MEK.
In addition to the ERK pathway, JNK has been reported to involve
AP-1 activation and neoplastic transformation in JB6 P+ cells (35).
Other studies have found that JNK2-deficient mice failed to induce
skin tumorigenesis in response to TPA, which also supports the
important role of JNK in skin tumorigenesis (36). This prompted us
to examine the effect of RWE on TPA-induced JNK phosphorylation
in JB6 P+ cells. RWE at only 20 Amol/L slightly inhibited TPAinduced JNK phosphorylation. These results indicated that the
inhibition of the ERK pathway by RWE might be responsible for the

of a hydrogen bond acceptor at the 3¶ position of their respective ring adjacent to the activation loop.

relative to quercetin also can be explained with the docking study
(Fig. 6B). Assuming that the binding mode of resveratrol would be
similar to that of quercetin, the 3¶ position of resveratrol would be
placed on the 3¶ position of quercetin. However, the lack of the
hydroxyl group at the 3¶ position of resveratrol would result in the
failure of the formation of the hydrogen bond between resveratrol
and the backbone amide group of Ser212. Compared with quercetin,
kaempferol (3,4¶,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavon), a compound structurally
related to quercetin, has a lesser inhibitory effect on MEK1 (data not
shown). The only structural difference between kaempferol and
quercetin is the lack of the hydroxyl group at the 3¶ position.
Therefore, kaempferol cannot inhibit MEK1 effectively for the same
reason as resveratrol (Fig. 6B).
In summary, RWE or quercetin inhibited tumor promoter–
induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells. This inhibition
was mediated mainly through the blocking of the Raf/MEK/ERK/
p90RSK pathway and subsequent suppression of AP-1 and NF-nB
activity. RWE or quercetin binds with MEK1 or Raf1 but inhibits
MEK1 activity more strongly than Raf1 activity. Together, these
results suggested that MEK1 is the most potent molecular target of
RWE or quercetin for suppressing neoplastic transformation and
that the chemopreventive effects of RWE are more likely to be
attributable to quercetin than to resveratrol.

H-Ras–induced or EGF-induced neoplastic transformation, and
these results support the finding that RWE or quercetin inhibits the
MEK/ERK pathway regardless of the types of inducers stimulating
this pathway.
In contrast to other protein kinase inhibitors, MEK1 inhibitors,
including PD098059, U0126, PD184352, and PD318088, do not
compete with ATP, which accounts for their high selectivity (38).
PD184352 is another MEK1-specific inhibitor used in clinical trials,
and it binds in a unique inhibitor-binding pocket that is adjacent to
the ATP-binding site (39). In contrast to the highly homologous
ATP-binding site, this unique binding pocket of MEK contains
distinctive sequences that are not shared with other kinases. The
binding of PD184352 with MEK1 results in a stabilized inactive
conformation and a deformation of catalytic sites (39). To investigate the MEK1 inhibition mechanism of quercetin, we carried out a
modeling study (Fig. 6). Interestingly, quercetin could be docked to
the pocket separate from but adjacent to the ATP-binding site
similar to that observed for PD318088 (Fig. 6A) in the crystal
structure of the MEK1-PD318088 complex (39). The predicted
binding mode of quercetin is also similar to that of PD318088. The
hydroxyl group at the 7 position can make a hydrogen bond with the
backbone carbonyl group of Val127 in the ATP noncompetitive
binding site. In addition, several van der Waals interactions exist
with the hydrophobic surface formed by Ile99, Ile141, Phe209, and
Leu118. The C ring interacts with the residues in the activation loop
of the inactive MEK1. Val211 and Leu215 form van der Waals
interactions with the C ring of the inhibitor. The hydroxyl group at
the 3¶ position of the C ring can make a critical hydrogen bond with
the backbone amide group of Ser212. These interactions of quercetin
with the activation loop would lock MEK1 into a catalytically
inactive species by stabilizing the inactive conformation of the
activation loop. The low MEK1 inhibitory activity of resveratrol
