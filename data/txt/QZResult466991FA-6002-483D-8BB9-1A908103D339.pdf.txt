Abstract

Author Manuscript

High-throughput screens (HTS) of compound toxicity against cancer cells can identify thousands
of potential new drug-leads. But only limited numbers of these compounds can progress to
expensive and labor intensive efficacy studies in mice, creating a ‘bottle-neck’ in the drug
development pipeline. Approaches that triage drug-leads for further study are greatly needed.
Here, we provide an intermediary platform between HTS and mice by adapting mouse models of
pediatric brain tumors to grow as orthotopic xenografts in the brains of zebrafish. Freshly isolated
mouse ependymoma, glioma and choroid plexus carcinoma cells expressing red fluorescence
protein (RFP) were conditioned to grow at 34°C. Conditioned tumor cells were then transplanted
orthotopically into the brains of zebrafish acclimatized to ambient temperatures of 34°C. Live in
vivo fluorescence imaging identified robust, quantifiable and reproducible brain tumor growth as
well as spinal metastasis in zebrafish. All tumor xenografts in zebrafish retained the histological
characteristics of the corresponding parent mouse tumor and efficiently recruited fish endothelial
cells to form a tumor vasculature. Finally, by treating zebrafish harboring ERBB2-driven gliomas
with an appropriate cytotoxic chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(Erlotinib), we show that these models can effectively assess drug efficacy. Our data demonstrate,
for the first time, that mouse brain tumors can grow orthtopically in fish and serve as a platform to

and inexpensively, these models may serve as a powerful tool to triage drug-leads from HTS for
formal efficacy testing in mice.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Brain tumors include the most lethal forms of childhood cancer, but few new treatments of
these diseases have been developed during the last 30 years1. This impasse has resulted, in
part, from a lack of disease models that can be used in preclinical HTS and drug efficacy
testing. Recently, our group and others have developed accurate mouse models of pediatric
medulloblastoma2–5, glioma6, ependymoma7 and choroid plexus carcinoma. Together these
models represent >60% of childhood brain tumors and therefore have great potential to
discover new therapies for all patients. The development of the Smoothened inhibitor
Vismodegib for the treatment of SHH-subtype medulloblastoma using the Ptch+/−; Tp53−/−
mouse model provides proof-of-principle of this approach8. We have also shown that mouse
brain tumor models can be used in HTS campaigns; identifying bolus 5-flourouracil as a
new treatment of ependymoma that has now entered clinical trial9.

Author Manuscript

The integration of cell culture and robotic technologies has made HTS a powerful drug
discovery tool, identifying hundreds of lead compounds with potent anticancer cell
activity10, 11. But further triaging of these compounds for resource-intensive, in vivo testing
in mice can be difficult. We reasoned that zebrafish might provide a relatively inexpensive
and high-throughput system to triage compounds between HTS and definitive mouse model
studies. Zebrafish have proved an excellent tool for studying the biology and treatment of
cancer, including human tumor xenografts, but they have not been studied as a host for brain
tumors or mouse cancer xenografts12, 13. Here we report an efficient system that allows
mouse brain tumors to be grown in the brains of zebrafish. These tumors recapitulate the
histology of the parent mouse tumor and can be used to test drug efficacy. Since large
cohorts of zebrafish bearing brain tumors can be generated rapidly and inexpensively, these
models may serve as a powerful new tool in the drug development pipeline between HTS
and formal efficacy testing in mice.

Results and Discussion
Establishment of orthotopic mouse brain tumor xenografts in zebrafish

Author Manuscript

Red fluorescence protein (RFP) expressing tumor cells were isolated from three mouse brain
tumor models generated exactly as described previously7, including a mouse model of
glioblastoma generated by transducing Ink4a/Arf−/−, mouse embryonic neural stem cells
(NSC) with an ERBB2-RFP retrovirus (GBMERBB2-RFP); and two separate ependymoma
models generated from NSC transduced with RTBDN-RFP (EPRTBDN-RFP) or EPHB2-RFP
retroviruses (EPEPHB2-RFP). We also isolated cells from a new mouse model of choroid
plexus carcinoma that we recently developed by transducing the choroid plexus of
embryonic Tp53flx/flx;Rbflx/flx;PTENflx/flx mice with Cre-recombinase-RFP (CPCRFP,
unpublished).

As a first step to test if mouse brain tumors can grow orthotopically in zebrafish, we
implanted 10 zebrafish with 2×105 of each tumor cell type. Cells were injected via the
intranasal route into the cerebrum of anesthetized, 30 day old, dexamethasoneimmunosuppressed, zebrafish. Ten control fish were similarly implanted with RFP-only
transduced NSC. Similar amounts of RFP+ cells were readily detected by direct intravital
fluorescence microscopy (IFM) in all zebrafish brains 24 hours following implantation; but
no tumor cells were detectable in recipient zebrafish after three days and no fish developed
tumors (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

We reasoned that the marked difference in body temperature between mice (37°C) and
zebrafish (~28°C) might account for the failed engraftment of tumors. Therefore, we
conditioned freshly isolated cultures of mouse tumors (or control NSCRFP) to grow at 34°C
by reducing the temperature of cultured cells by 0.75°C per week for 4 weeks (Figure 1a,b).
Similarly, we acclimatized zebrafish to an ambient temperature of 34°C by increasing their
water temperature by 1°C per day for six days (Figure 1c). Remarkably, under these
conditions, all four tumor cell types demonstrated robust and rapid engraftment in zebrafish
brains, resulting in the death of recipient fish from brain tumors within a median of five to
seven days (Figures 1d,e and 2). Serial IFM of zebrafish readily detected reproducible and
significant increases in brain fluorescence, indicative of tumor growth (EPRTBDN-RFP,
p=0.001; EPEPHB2-RFP, p=0.008; GBMERBB2-RFP, p=0.002, CPCRFP, p=0.02; MannWhitney Figure 2e). In contrast, no fish harboring NSCRFP cells displayed increased
fluorescence or tumor development (Figure 2d, f).
Zebrafish brain tumors recapitulate the histology of the parent tumor and metastasize
through the central nervous system

Author Manuscript

As an initial test of the fidelity of our brain tumor xenografts, we reviewed the histology and
immunophenotype of all tumors (Figure 3a). Each mouse brain tumor retained its hallmark
morphological features when xenografted into zebrafish brains. EPRTBDN-RFP and
EPEPHB2-RFP tumors in both mouse and zebrafish contained pseudorosettes and were glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactive. GBMERBB2-RFP tumors in both species
displayed cellular pleomorphism, had high mitotic rates (indicated by robust Ki67 nuclear
immunoreactivity), and were intensely ERBB2 and GFAP immunoreactive. Finally, CPCRFP
tumors displayed a typical epithelioid morphology and expressed transthyretin receptor (Ttr)
that is highly restricted to normal and malignant choroid plexus14 (Figure 3a).

Author Manuscript

Brain tumors have a propensity to disseminate through the central nervous system (CNS).
Therefore, to test if zebrafish xenografts also metastasize, we generated cohorts of zebrafish
implanted with EPRTBDN-RFP, GBMERBB2-RFP, or CPCRFP cells and monitored the spines of
each animal using daily IFM (Figure 3b). 5.3% (n=5/94), 11.1% (n=3/27), and 23.1%
(n=3/13) of zebrafish bearing GBMERBB2-RFP, CPCRFP, and EPRTBDN-RFP tumors,
respectively, developed RFP+ masses along the spinal axis that were distinct from the main
implanted tumor. In each case, spinal masses were undetectable immediately following cell
implantation but developed one to two days post implantation. Histologic analyses of the
complete CNS of fish confirmed that these masses were independent, distant deposits of
tumor rather than direct extensions of the main tumor mass (Figure 3b). Thus, implanted

mouse brain tumors disseminate through the CNS of zebrafish and IFM of these tumors may
serve as a useful tool for studying brain tumor metastasis in vivo.
Xenografted mouse brain tumors recruit zebrafish CNS vasculature

Author Manuscript

The recruitment of normal blood vessels by cancer cells represents a critical step in
tumorigenesis and metastasis15. Fli1:enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (eGFP)
transgenic zebrafish that express eGFP specifically in endothelial cells16 have been used
effectively to study angiogenesis in peripheral solid tumor xenografts17. Therefore, to test if
mouse brain tumor cells are competent to induce angiogenesis in zebrafish, we generated
EPRTBDN-RFP and GBMERBB2-RFP tumors in Fli1:eGFP fish. Dual immunofluorescence of
tumor sections confirmed that all RFP+ mouse brain tumors effectively recruited an eGFP+
zebrafish vasculature (Figure 3c). In contrast to the uniform, regularly spaced and nontortuous vessels in normal brain, eGFP+ blood vessels in mouse xenografts were frequently
branched, highly variable in size and tortuous (Figure 3c). Thus, mouse brain tumors
implanted in zebrafish recruit host vasculature. Since fluorescent tumor cells and blood
vessels can be imaged by IFM in live animals, this system holds great promise to study brain
tumor angiogenesis in vivo.
Mouse gliomas retain the transcriptome of their parent tumor in zebrafish

Author Manuscript

To test more comprehensively if our xenografts recapitulate the biology of the
corresponding parent mouse brain tumor, we used Affymetrix M430 microarrays to compare
the transcriptomes of GBMERBB2-RFP, EPRTBDN-RFP, and CPCRFP tumors growing in both
species. Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering of tumor transcriptomes confirmed that,
regardless of host species, samples of the same tumor type are related to each other, but are
distinct from other tumors (Figure 3d). To test if the transcriptome of any given tumor type
grown in mice correlates with the transcriptome of the same tumor type grown in zebrafish,
we used our recently developed AGDEX algorithm that estimates the degree of similarity
between transcriptomes derived from different tissues7, 18. A positive AGDEX score
indicates a positive correlation in transcriptome between compared tissues; the significance
of this correlation is assigned a permuted p-value that controls for false discovery. All three
tumor types displayed positive AGDEX scores, indicating that the mouse and zebrafish
brain tumor transcriptomes are positively related (Figure 3e). GBMERBB2-RFP correlated
particularly closely with the parent mouse tumor suggesting that zebrafish xenografts of this
tumor are especially faithful reproductions of the parent tumor (AGDEX score 0.24,
permuted p=0.02; Figure 3e).
Brain tumor xenografts in zebrafish can be used as a preclinical drug development tool

Author Manuscript

Since GBMERBB2-RFP xenografts most closely recapitulated the histology and transcriptome
of their parent mouse tumors, we used this model to test our system as a preclinical drug
development tool. Current cancer chemotherapies can be broadly divided into non-specific
cytotoxic drugs and small molecule inhibitors of specific tumorigenic proteins. We selected
one drug each from these two classes that have known activity against human GBM: the
cytotoxic antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)19 and tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Erlotinib20
that targets ERBB2 that is mutated in human GBM21 and drives GBMERBB2-RFP.

First, we confirmed that GBMERBB2-RFP cells are sensitive to 5-FU and Erlotinib with an
effective concentration to inhibit growth by 50% (EC50) of 0.34μM and 0.21μM,
respectively (Figure 4a,b). Next, 28 adult zebrafish were implanted with GBMERBB2-RFP
cells exactly as described above and imaged using IFM to confirm the presence of RFP+
tumor cells. Zebrafish were then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: vehicle
control (n=9, 5-FU; n=5, Erlotinib); 5-FU (n=8) or erlotinib (n=6). Erlotinib is water
insoluble, and was therefore delivered by oral gavage as described previously22. Briefly,
10μl of a 5% DMSO solution containing an equivalent of 200mg/kg erlotinib was delivered
via a p10 pipette tip inserted into the oral cavity of anaesthetized fish so that the tip was
positioned adjacent to the gills. We showed previously that this dose blocks ERBB2
signaling in brain tumors in mice23. The ‘erlotinib group’ was dosed once per day on two
consecutive days. Control fish were treated by oral gavage of vehicle only (5% DMSO). 5FU was administered to zebrafish by adding the drug directly to tank water. We first
determined the maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU by adding increasing concentrations of
drug to the tank water of non-tumor bearing fish (data not shown). The ‘5-FU group’ were
then treated at this maximum tolerated dose (4.7mM) on two consecutive days. Five control
zebrafish received DMSO only. Tumor development was measured in all zebrafish by IFM.
GBMERBB2-RFP tumors in zebrafish were highly sensitive to 5-FU therapy, displaying a
~50% reduction in tumor size relative to baseline, while tumors in vehicle treated fish
doubled in size over the same time period (Figure 4c,d; p<0.0001). Erlotinib also inhibited
brain tumor growth relative to control treatment, although this effect was less significant
than that of 5-FU (Figure 4c, d; P<0.01).

Author Manuscript

Finally, since erlotinib inhibits the ERBB2 tyrosine kinase that drives GBMERBB2-RFP
tumors, we used phospho-specific immunohistochemistry to test if the drug inhibited
ERBB2 signaling brain tumors in zebrafish (Figure 4e). Intense, membrane and cytoplasmic
pERBB2Y1248 immunoreactivity was readily detected in GBMERBB2-RFP cells in the brains
of three independent, vehicle treated fish. In stark contrast, pERBB2Y1248 immunoreactivity
was virtually undetectable in GBMERBB2-RFP tumors three days following the onset of
erlotinib therapy (Figure 4e). Thus, erlotinib effectively inhibits ERBB2 signaling in tumor
cells in the zebrafish brain.

Author Manuscript

We report the first orthotopic models of mouse brain tumors in adult zebrafish. All models
recapitulate the histology of their parent tumor. In addition, our glioma model retained a
similar gene expression profile to its parent tumor. We further show that metastasis can be
imaged in live zebrafish. Imaging of metastasis and other cellular processes in mice is
challenging, in large part because existing fluorescence, bioluminescence and radiological
imaging of mice has limited resolution. The translucency, small size, and ease of husbandry
of zebrafish renders them useful for studying hematopoietic and solid malignancies in
peripheral tissues in vivo12, 13. Our demonstration that tumor dissemination can also be
visualized in the zebrafish CNS could greatly enhance understanding of the biology and
treatment of brain metastasis. This is especially important since primary brain tumors kill
patients by direct or metastatic invasion of the nervous system24, and brain metastasis of
peripheral solid cancers are a major cause of morbidity and mortality25.

Our zebrafish system also allows preclinical testing of potential new brain tumor therapies.
Tumor-bearing zebrafish embryos are an established system for the conduct of chemical
genetic and therapeutic screens of cancer12, 13, 26–28. Indeed, drug screens against melanoma
in zebrafish embryos have led directly to human clinical trials of the dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase inhibitor, Leflunomide. Since zebrafish embryos can be maintained and
treated in multi-well plates, they are a valuable whole organism system for conducting
chemical screens26. However, the bathing of embryos in drug solution does not accurately
model clinical drug dosing and it is unclear if tumors growing in developing or mature
tissues are equivalently responsive to drugs. Our system allows for testing of drugs against
brain tumors growing in the adult brain. We further show that oral gavage (erlotinib) or
direct tank water administration (5-FU) of drug can be used to treat tumors in this system.

We are currently working to refine our zebrafish brain tumor models. Adult zebrafish need
to be immunosuppressed to accept tumor xenografts since there are no widely available
immunodeficient mutants. Current approaches to immunosuppress zebrafish include
chemical or radiation immunoablation13. However, these treatments can result in unwanted
morbidity and mortality, reducing the efficiency of the experimental system. Therefore, we
are investigating whether recently described immunodeficient but viable mutant strains e.g.,
Rag1−/−29 can accept tumor xenografts without the need for exogenous immunosuppression.
Additional mutant strains may also improve the utility of our model system. The relative
translucency of zebrafish facilitates transcranial fluorescence imaging of brain tumors;
however, the resolution of this imaging could be increased dramatically in mutants that lack
melanophores or iridiophores e.g., Casper mutant30. Indeed, while reproducible growth was
detected in our tumor implants, inter-tumoral variability in tumor growth was noted. This
might reflect, in part, difficulties in detecting deep seated fluorescent tumor cells through a
translucent cranium. Thus mutant fish may improve the resolution and sensitivity of our
imaging system.
Although our models hold promise to advance the treatment of brain tumors, several
questions need to be addressed before zebrafish can be formally integrated into the drug
development pipeline for these diseases. In particular, the degree to which drug efficacy in
zebrafish predicts activity in mice and humans remains to be determined. It will be
especially important to determine differences in the pharmacokinetics of drugs among
zebrafish, mice and humans. Relatively little is known about the pharmacokinetics of most
drugs in zebrafish. If our fish model is to effectively triage drugs between HTS and mouse
models, then it will be important to ensure that promising agents are not rejected because of
unfavorable, but species specific, pharmacokinetic profiles in zebrafish. Ongoing parallel
studies of zebrafish and mouse systems should answer these important questions.

(a) RFP+ mouse brain tumors were imaged in live, anesthetized zebrafish using an Olympus
SZX10® stereomicroscope fitted with a 594nm filter. Representative intra-vital lateral (a)
and dorsal (b) images of ependymoma EPRTBDN-RFP. (c) This same zebrafish was
sacrificed, the brain macrodisected and imaged, confirming the RFP+ tumor is present
within the cerebral hemisphere. (d) Survival curve of zebrafish harboring the indicated
tumor types or control NSCs. The survival of zebrafish harboring tumors was significantly
reduced vs. control NSCRFP (P<0.001; Log-Rank). Zebrafish were implanted with (e) the
indicated tumor cells or (f) control NSCRFP and imaged exactly as described in (a). The
mean intensity of tumor fluorescence was measured using NIS Elements (v 3.2) software.

Serial day 1, 3 and 5 IFM images of eight zebrafish each harboring EPRTBDN-RFP,
GBMERBB2-RFP or CPCRFP tumors are shown. Average +SE RFP-fluorescence relative to
day 1 is shown in the graphs left (Mann-Whitney U test; *=p<0.05; **=p<0.005;
DOD=dead of disease). No NSCRFP were detectable in zebrafish brains one day following
implantation (f).

(a) Zebrafish harboring tumors were euthanized using 0.04% Tricaine and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight. Zebrafish were then decalcified using 0.5M EDTA
(AMRESCO®) for 5 days, rinsed in phosphate buffered saline, dehydrated and paraffin wax
embedded. 5μm sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or subjected to
standard immunohistochemistry using the indicated primary antibodies (GFAP 1:500, Dako
rabbit polyclonal Z0334; ERBB2 1:40, Vector mouse monoclonal VP-C380; Ki67, 1:1000,
Vector rabbit polyclonal vp-K451). TTR expression was visualized by in situ hybridization
using a full length TTR cRNA template (BC032069, generous gift of Dr. Edwin Monuki).
Paraffin sections were treated with RNAzip (Ambion, Austin, TX) and de-waxed to water.
Probe hybridization was performed at 60°C overnight in standard hybridization buffer.
Sections of the same tumors growing in mouse brains were analyzed in parallel for
comparison. Arrows in EPRTBDN-RFP H&E and GFAP mark pseudorosettes and GFAP+
tumor cells respectively. Dotted line in bottom right GBMERBB2-RFP H&E demarcates
tumor invading normal brain. Arrow indicates mitotic tumor cells (scale bars=15μm). (b)
Zebrafish were implanted with the indicated tumors and the entire dorsal brain and spine

imaged daily exactly as described in Figure 1 and 2. Arrows in H&E of EPRTBDN-RFP
tumors mark individual metastatic deposits. Pie charts report the proportion of zebrafish in
which the indicated tumors metastasized. (c) Fli1:eGFP zebrafish harboring tumors were
euthanized fixed and decalcified as described above. Brains containing tumor were then
cryo-protected in 30% sucrose for 2 days and frozen in tissue freezing media (TBS®). 12μm
sections were counter stained using DAPI containing hard set mounting media and imaged
by confocal microscopy with 488nm and 594nm filters. (d) Total RNA was extracted from
the indicated brain tumors grown in mouse and zebrafish brains. Microarray gene expression
profiles were generated using Affymetrix 430v2 arrays and subject to unsupervised
hierarchical clustering exactly as described7. Transcriptomes of each tumor type grown in
mouse and human brains were directly compared using the Agreement of Differential
Expression (AGDEX) algorithm exactly as described was used7.

(a) Single cell suspensions of 750 GBMERBB2-RFP tumor cells were seeded into each well of
a 96-well plate in neurobasal medium exactly as described7. 24 hours later cells were dosed
with the indicated concentrations of (a) 5-FU or (b) Erlotinib, or DMSO vehicle control and
incubated for a further 72 hours. Percent cell survival relative to DMSO only controls was
then determined in each well using the Cell Titer Glo reagent (Promega) and Envision plate
reader (Perkin-Elmer). Assays were performed in independent triplicates. (c) Zebrafish
harboring GBMERBB2-RFP tumors were established exactly as described in Figure 1. After
24 hours zebrafish were treated with addition of 5-FU or vehicle (control) to the tank water
(top), or vehicle (control) or Erlotinib by oral gavage on two consecutive days. All zebrafish
were imaged exactly as described in Figure 2. (d) Graph reports the fold fluorescence of
tumors shown in (c) at day 2 relative to fluorescence at day 0 in fish treated with vehicle, 5FU or erolotinib. Whiskers=extreme outliers, Box=median, 25th and 75th percentiles. (e)
