ABSTRACT
Rapidly growing tumor cells must synthesize proteins at a high rate and therefore
depend on an efficient folding and quality control system for nascent secretory proteins
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER resident thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 plays
an important role in disulfide bond formation. Lentiviral, doxycycline-inducible ERp57
knockdown was combined with irradiation and treatment with chemotherapeutic
agents. The knockdown of ERp57 significantly enhanced the apoptotic response to
anticancer treatment in HCT116 colon cancer cells via a p53-dependent mechanism.
Instead of a direct interaction with p53, depletion of ERp57 induced cell death via
a selective activation of the PERK branch of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR).
In contrast, apoptosis was reduced in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells harboring
mutant p53. Nevertheless, we observed a strong reduction of proliferation in response
to ERp57 knockdown in both cell lines regardless of the p53 status. Depletion of
ERp57 reduced the phosphorylation activity of the mTOR-complex1 (mTORC1) as
demonstrated by reduction of p70S6K phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that
ERp57 is a promising target for anticancer therapy due to synergistic p53-dependent
induction of apoptosis and p53-independent inhibition of proliferation.

Response (UPR) through one of its three ER-stress sensors
IRE1, PERK and ATF6. Aim of the UPR is to re-establish
ER homeostasis through reduction of protein synthesis
and simultaneous overexpression of ER chaperones [4].
Depending on the severity and duration of ER stress, the
UPR can be cytoprotective or induce apoptosis. Since the
apoptotic response in cancer cells is often attenuated or even
abrogated, this complex ER network becomes an important
pathway which supports growth [5, 6]. Activation of the UPR
can occur after general and reversible attenuation of protein
synthesis via eIF2α phosphorylation which is summarized
as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) [7]. In addition to
PERK, the ISR can also be mediated by other kinases upon
amino acid starvation, viral infection, iron deficiency and
oxidative stress. Activation of the ISR results in the synthesis
of UPR target genes through increased eIF2α-independent
translation of the transcription factor ATF4. Activation of at
least one branch of the UPR has been reported in a number

INTRODUCTION
One of the major challenges of current cancer
treatment is the resistance of tumor cells to ionizing
radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutical substances. In an
urgent need for new drug targets the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) has become a promising candidate since rapidly
growing tumor cells upregulate their protein synthesis and
therefore depend on efficient folding of nascent secretory
proteins in the ER. A set of molecular chaperones such
as BiP, calreticulin (CRT), protein disulfide isomerase
(PDI) and GRP94 is mandatory to maintain the critical
ER balance [1]. To avoid the accumulation of misfolded
proteins, these are bound by molecular chaperones,
transferred to the ER-associated degradation pathway
(ERAD) and get disposed of by the proteasome [2, 3].
One survival mechanism of cells under stress
conditions is the activation of the Unfolded Protein

of human tumor samples [8]. Consequently, ER chaperones
become an attractive target in cancer cells [9, 10]. For
instance, the knockdown of BiP enhanced doxorubicininduced apoptosis not only in proliferating HEp3 cells,
but also in a dormant subgroup which usually shows high
resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment [11].
The ER provides a more oxidizing environment
than the cytosol favoring formation of disulfide bonds in
nascent exoproteins which is crucial for their stability and
functionality. More than 20 members of the PDI family
introduce disulfide bonds into client proteins and catalyze
rearrangement of incorrectly formed disulfide bonds. The
most prominent member of the PDI family is PDIA1
which exerts oncogenic and pro-survival functions in
different cancer types [12, 13]. Interestingly, novel potent
PDI inhibitors are being developed, but their clinical value
has yet to be proven [14–16]. The closest homologue of
PDI is the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 (GRp58/1,25D3MARRS Receptor/PDIA3), best known for its structural
role in the assembly of the MHC class I molecule
[17]. However, similar to PDI, it affects disulfide bond
formation and reformation in the processing of numerous
client proteins [18]. Both PDI and ERp57 are composed of
four distinct domains a, b, b’ and a’ forming a horseshoe
shape where the a and a’ domains carry the active site
CGHC and the b’ domains of both enzymes contain the
substrate binding site [19]. Of note, despite its C-terminal
ER retention signal (QEDL), ERp57 was found in the
cytoplasm as an interaction partner of mTOR [20] and

STAT3 [21] as well as in the nucleus involved in DNA
binding [22, 23] and on the cell surface [24, 25].
Although some of the localization and functional
studies of ERp57 are not entirely conclusive, ERp57
turned out to be a much more important player than
originally anticipated with a cellular impact beyond the
ER. Of particular interest is the report of an siRNAmediated knockdown of ERp57 that increased cell death
in two human cancer cell lines initiated by the synthetic
drug fenretinide [26] although the authors did not address
the question how downregulation of ERp57 was actually
linked to apoptosis. Here, we tested the potential benefit
of targeting ERp57 in the human cancer cell lines HCT116
and MDA-MB-231 in combination with irradiation and
chemotherapeutic compounds.

RESULTS
ERp57 modulates apoptosis in response to
anticancer treatment
Lentiviral doxycycline-inducible ERp57 knockdown
displayed an efficiency of 80–90% on average.
Suppression of ERp57 significantly and consistently
increased apoptosis in HCT116shERp57 (Fig. 1 and 2A).
In contrast, induction of apoptosis following ERp57
knockdown in MDA-MB-231shERp57 cells was observed
to vary between no effect and a slight protection against
apoptosis (Fig. 1 and 2A).

Figure 1: ERp57 modulates irradiation-induced apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner. HCT116shERp57 and

MDA-MB-231shERp57 were irradiated with 10 Gy 24 h after induction of the ERp57 knockdown. 72 h after irradiation whole cell extracts
were tested for caspase-3 activity (upper panel). In parallel, total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting (lower panel).

Knockdown of ERp57 activates the PERK
branch of the UPR selectively

Following IR the cell lines showed different
responses to depletion of ERp57. Wild-type p53
expressing HCT116shERp57 cells displayed enhanced
sensitivity to irradiation-induced apoptosis while MDAMB-231shERp57 cells harbouring mutant p53 (R280K)
were protected against irradiation-induced apoptosis after
knockdown induction (Fig. 1). In HCT116shERp57 cells
p53 was induced by both knockdown of ERp57 and IR
whereas the combined treatment did not further increase
p53 levels.
However, while the pro-apoptotic p53 target Bax
was reduced following suppression of ERp57 (Fig. 1),
another pro-apoptotic p53 target, PUMA, was strongly
induced. In MDA-MB-231shERp57 the induction of
p53 and PUMA following ERp57 knockdown was much
less pronounced (Fig. 3C). Reduced apoptosis correlated
with reduced Bax protein levels in MDA-MB-231
which is in line with the differing effects on apoptosis
induction.
Following etoposide treatment similar effects
of ERp57 knockdown were observed. In line with a
protective effect of ERp57 in HCT116shERp57, these
cells showed increased etoposide-induced apoptosis
after doxycycline treatment. In contrast, MDA-MB231shERp57 cells were protected against etoposideinduced apoptosis upon ERp57 knockdown (Fig. 2A).
These alterations were also reflected by changes in early
and late apoptotic/necrotic fractions of the cells upon
double staining with annexin V and propidium iodide
(PI) (Fig. 2B). While knockdown of ERp57 increased
the apoptotic fraction from 22% to 35% in untreated
HCT116shERp57 cells, these changes were not observed
in MDA-MB-231shERp57 cells. Treatment with 50 μM
etoposide without knockdown induced apoptosis to a
similar extent of approximately 50% in both cell lines,
whereas suppression of ERp57 induced opposite effects
in the two cell lines when combined with etoposide. In
HCT116shERp57 cells combined treatment increased
the apoptotic fraction from 54% to 72%. In contrast,
suppression of ERp57 reduced etoposide-induced
apoptosis from 45% to 24% in MDA-MB-231shERp57
cells. Similar to the results observed for IR, apoptosis
induction in HCT116shERp57 correlated with the
induction of p53 and PUMA while the amount of
Bax protein was not altered (Fig. 2C). In MDA-MB231shERp57 cells ERp57 suppression did not lead to
pronounced changes in p53 and PUMA although PUMA
was strongly induced following treatment with etoposide.
Interestingly, Bax was generally reduced upon ERp57
knockdown in the breast cancer cells which coincided
with the reduction of apoptosis particularly upon
treatment with etoposide where a reduction of apoptosis
and Bax protein was observed. The apoptotic response of
HCT116shERp57 cells to 5-fluorouracil was similar to the
response to etoposide (Fig. 2D, 2E and 2F).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To assess whether the apoptotic response in
HCT116 cells is caused by unfolded proteins in the ER,
all branches of the UPR were tested following suppression
of ERp57 in untreated and irradiated cells. Although an
induction of ATF4 and eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser51
was observed which indicates inhibition of protein
translation (Fig. 3A), an induction of XBP1reporter gene
activity or mRNA splicing (Fig. 3B) or ATF6 (Fig. 3C)
reporter gene activity was not detectable. ER-stress has
been reported to activate the JNK-pathway via IRE1
[27]. However, we were not able to detect stimulation
of the JNK pathway after depletion of ERp57 (Fig. 3D).
Together with the activation of ATF4 (Fig. 3A) these
results point to a selective activation of the PERK branch
of the UPR. In addition, increased expression of the
abundant ER chaperone and ERAD component GRP94
(Fig. 3E) was detectable. Upregulation of PDI (Fig. 3G)
or calreticulin or calnexin (Fig. 3H) were undetectable
and induction of BiP occurred only inconsistently upon
ERp57 knockdown (Fig. 3A and 3G). In irradiated cells
we detected similar phosphorylation levels of eIF2α and
a similar increase in GRP94 as observed after ERp57
suppression. Following ERp57 inhibition and irradiation
the more pronounced induction of eIF2α phosphorylation
and ATF4 protein expression demonstrated a further
increase in ER stress levels (Fig. 3E). However, ATF6
activity and further induction of BiP protein levels were
not detectable after knockdown of ERp57 in irradiated
cells (Fig. 3A and 3C). Interestingly, GRP94 expression
further increased under these conditions (Fig. 3E). To
examine a direct involvement of the activated PERK
branch in the apoptotic response, we treated the cells
with the specific PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 [28].
The inhibitor reduced caspase-3 activity, phospho-p53
and PUMA (Fig. 3F and 3G). Of note, different results
were obtained for the two pro-apoptotic factors after
ATF4 activation: while CHOP remained low or was
even decreased, GADD34 was elevated (Fig. 3G). Taken
together these results indicate that depletion of ERp57
does not induce apoptosis via full activation of the UPR
but enables selective activation of the PERK branch which
triggers the induction of cell death.

Loss of ERp57 promotes apoptosis in a
p53-dependent manner
To prove that the induction of apoptosis is indeed
dependent on p53, the isogenic HCT116 cell line deficient
for p53 was tested for the response to IR in the presence
and absence of ERp57. HCT116shERp57 p53 -/- cells
showed a less prominent increase in apoptosis after ERp57
knockdown induction as compared to p53 wild-type cells

(Fig. 4A). In addition, ERp57-dependent changes were not
observed in irradiation-induced apoptosis in p53-deficient
cells. Wild-type p53 induced in HCT116shERp57 cells
upon treatment with doxycycline was phosphorylated
at Ser15 demonstrating targeted activation of the tumor
suppressor (Fig. 4B). In addition, the induction of PUMA
observed in the p53 +/+ cells was not present upon
depletion of ERp57 in p53-deficient cells while Bax
protein levels were strongly reduced (Fig. 4B).
To further investigate whether a direct interaction
between p53 and ERp57 is involved in protection against
apoptosis, p53 was immunoprecipitated from untreated
and irradiated HCT116 cells. ERp57 was undetectable in
p53 pulldown samples while the known interaction partner
MDM2 co-precipitated with p53 (Fig. 5A).
As ERp57 contains a potential nuclear localization
signal (Fig. 5B) and has previously been described
to be located not only to ER and cytoplasm but also
to the nucleus [22, 29], we tested whether ERp57 is
involved in transcriptional regulation. Thus, a GFPtagged fusion protein was introduced into HCT116 to
determine the subcellular localization of ERp57 (Fig. 5B).

Counterstaining of ER and nucleus demonstrated that
ERp57-GFP is localized in the perinuclear space but
not inside the nucleus in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5C). False
positive signals in the nucleus were disproven by z-stack
confocal microscopy. A fraction of the protein localized
to the cytoplasm as demonstrated by permeabilisation of
the plasma membrane with digitonin. Importantly, the
integrity of ER membranes was not compromised as the
ER resident protein BiP was not extracted (Fig. 5D). The
extraction of cytoplasmic fluid was proven by detection
of GAPDH.

ERp57 triggers proliferation of cancer cells
independent of the p53 status
Next, we examined the impact of ERp57 on cell
cycle progression of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231. In
both cell lines knockdown of ERp57 induced cell cycle
arrest in the G2-phase while the amount of cells in the G0/
G1-phase was reduced (Fig. 6A). For HCT116shERp57
cells the effect of combined treatment with irradiation and
knockdown of ERp57 on G2 arrest was more pronounced

than for MDA-MB-231 cells. Similar results were
obtained for cellular proliferation. For both cell lines cell
numbers were significantly reduced upon knockdown of
ERp57 (Fig. 6B). Upon incubation with 10 μM etoposide
cell numbers were not significantly altered by suppression
of ERp57 (Fig. 6C). In summary, as opposed to the distinct
apoptotic responses, HCT116shERp57 and MDA-MB231shERp57 cells showed similar changes in proliferation
following knockdown of ERp57.
To examine p53-dependence of the proliferation
response HCT116 p53 proficient cells were compared
to the isogenic p53 deficient cells following ERp57
knockdown. ERp57 has been shown to be involved
in regulation and assembly of mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). As a measure for
mTORC1 activity we monitored phosphorylation of
p70S6K at Thr389 in p53 proficient and deficient cells
following knockdown of ERp57. We observed decreased
activity irrespective of the presence of p53, albeit less
pronounced in p53 -/- cells (Fig. 7A). This effect was
even stronger when cells were treated with IR in addition.
In line with these changes proliferation was significantly
decreased in HCT116shERp57 cells in the presence
and absence of p53 (Fig. 7B). We further performed
clonogenic survival assays to test radiation sensitivity of
HCT116 p53 +/+ cells after ERp57 depletion (Fig. 7C).
ERp57 depletion alone led to a loss of colony formation as
effective as treatment with 3 Gy. In combination however,
this effect was amplified between 12- and 15-fold
depending on the radiation dose.

In addition, human A549 lung cancer cells showed ER
stress-mediated inhibition of DNA double-strand break
repair that enhanced radiosensitivity [36]. Encouraged by
previous work [12] which provided evidence that global
inhibition of PDI activity mediated by bacitracin can boost
the apoptotic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, our initial
hypothesis was that depletion of ERp57 in tumor cells
would result in severe ER stress and favour cell death,
even more pronounced in combination with IR.
The ER luminal oxidoreductase ERp57 (EC5.3.4.1),
also termed GRP58 or PDIA3, is involved in disulfide
bond formation of exoproteins. Indeed, ablation of ERp57
triggered apoptosis and magnified the impact of IR and
chemotherapeutics in human colon cancer HCT116 cells
which was dependent on a crosstalk between the ER and
functional p53. The triple negative breast cancer cell
line MDA-MB-231 carrying mutant p53, however, did
not show enhanced apoptosis, although the knockdown
efficiency was comparable between both cell lines. In our
hands ERp57 was not detectable inside the nucleus and thus
contradicts other studies that suggested a nuclear role for
ERp57 in DNA binding, repair and gene activation [22, 37].
In HCT116 cells, we detected a very distinct
cellular response via the PERK branch only, whereas
neither IRE1 nor ATF6 showed activation after ERp57
knockdown alone. In addition, we did not observe more
than basal protein levels of the ER chaperones calnexin,
CRT and the ER master sensor BiP. These findings are
in line with previous reports since induction of these
proteins is primarily driven by activated ATF6 through
binding to ER stress response elements (ERSEs) in their
promotor regions [38]. In an earlier study, ERp57 was
targeted with specific siRNA in the human endothelial cell
line EA. hy926 and, in contrast to our results, decreased
the apoptotic response. The authors also noticed an
upregulation of BiP which potentially explains the cell
protective effect [39]. Remarkably, the only ER chaperone
that was affected by ERp57 depletion in our study was
GRP94 [40]. Interestingly, the substrates of GRP94 are
believed to be disulfide-bonded proteins exclusively
[41] which are prone to misfolding and aggregation after
downregulation of the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57. It
seems possible that the exclusive upregulation of GRP94
is a specific response to boost the disposal of misfolded
client proteins of ERp57 but prevents a full UPR at the
same time. A phenotype similar to ours was obtained in
a former study of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells
where all tested ER chaperones were unaffected by single
knockdown and even by double knockdown of ERp57
with PDI accomplished by siRNA gene silencing [42].
The striking phenotypes found in many studies which used
toxic chemical ER stress inducers such as thapsigargin or
tunicamycin are unlikely to reflect the much more nuanced
outcome of ER stress caused by hypoxia, ROS or nutrient
deprivation and may thus be grossly misleading [43]. In
support of this, a previous study examined the impact of

DISCUSSION
One metabolic trait which distinguishes most
tumor cells from normal cells is that, despite harsh
microenvironmental conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient
deprivation and low pH, they must synthesize proteins
at a high rate and therefore show an upregulation of the
ER folding machinery per se which leads to continuous
perturbation of the ER and activation of ERAD.
When the ER cannot cope with the level of misfolded
proteins, the unfolded protein response (UPR) results
in reversible inhibition of protein translation, triggers
expression of ER chaperones and may in the case of
persistent malfunction tip the balance from pro-survival
activity to apoptosis. However, a general benefit for
tumor patients through UPR-activation remains highly
controversial, as most tumor cells as compared to noncancerous cells bypass apoptotic stress responses during
prolonged ER stress and even worse, show increased
resistance to chemotherapeutics due to upregulation of
ER chaperones, in particular BiP [30–33]. On the other
hand, several studies have demonstrated that treatment
with ER stressing agents sensitizes tumor cells to
alkylating agents like cisplatinum and melphalan [34, 35].

individually silenced ER chaperones and postulated very
distinct cellular stress responses [44]. Hence, it is possible
that the so called “classical” UPR with a full activation of
all three branches is either a very transient or a quite rare
event in vivo.
Activation of the PERK- eIF2α pathway results in
a global inhibition of cap-dependent protein translation
but stimulates translation of the basic leucine-zipper
transcription factor ATF4, the master regulator of the
ISR. Two of its target genes are GADD34 and CHOP,
both are pro-apoptotic factors with short half-lives, but
with different action patterns: GADD34 is a cofactor of
protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) which dephosphorylates
eIFα after prolonged ER stress to initiate apoptosis
eventually through an overload of protein translation
[45, 46]. CHOP (also known as GADD153) on the
other hand is a transcription factor itself and mediates
upregulation of the pro-apoptotic factors PUMA, BIM
and DR5 after ER stress [47–49]. Remarkably, although
we detected PERK-mediated ER stress in HCT116 cells
after ERp57 knockdown followed by a strong PUMA
expression, we did not observe any CHOP induction at all.
This observation bears the question how p53-dependent
apoptosis is linked to ER stress in this scenario. In fact, the
ablation of ERp57 led to upregulation of GADD34 which
was suggested by others to play an additional, more direct
role in apoptosis via phosphorylation of cytoplasmic p53
[50, 51]. Presumably, a protein interaction of GADD34
with p53 could also compete for binding to PP1. This might
explain why we detected phosphorylated eIF2α despite
enhanced GADD34 levels. Moreover, a very recent study
described a new aspect of the interplay between disturbed
ER homeostasis, cytoplasmic p53 and the Ca2+-dependent
mitochondrial apoptosis [52]. The authors demonstrate that
activated cytoplasmic wild type p53 can bind and modulate
SERCA pumps at the ER, followed by [Ca2+] transfer
from the ER to mitochondria ultimately leading to cell
death. Interestingly, this non-nuclear pro-apoptotic effect
of p53 is abolished in mutants defective in DNA binding
thus emphasizing the crucial role of the DNA binding
domain for pro-apoptotic functions of WT p53. Apart
from its function as an anti-apoptotic factor in WT p53
expressing tumor cells, our data provided strong evidence
that ERp57 acts as an indispensable growth factor, notably
independent of the p53 status of the cell. This effect on
proliferation is probably carried out by the cytosolic
fraction of ERp57, at least partly through stabilizing the
mTORC1 complex to promote phosphorylation of its
downstream target S6K1 as reported here and by others
[20]. In addition we noticed an enhanced G2-M arrest after
ERp57 depletion which is particularly interesting since this
is the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle [53]. At
this point we do not know how ERp57 interferes in cell
cycle progression. However, an ER stress induced G2
arrest via PERK was described previously, but in contrast
to our results the authors showed a strict dependency on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p53 [54]. Instead, cytoplasmic ERp57 may function as an
activator of phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinases [55].
Whether any of the contributions of ERp57 requires its
oxidoreductive activity or is based on structural properties
has not been addressed yet. Unfortunately, it is not possible
yet to compare the effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown
of ERp57 with a specific inhibitor of ERp57. Clearly,
further work is needed to unravel the cellular impact of
ERp57 on cell cycle and proliferation which is the object
of an ongoing investigation in our lab.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that depletion
of ERp57 leads to a significant induction of p53dependent apoptosis. Although classical ER stress
was not detectable at various time points after ERp57
knockdown, we noticed a selective activation of PERK
and an upregulation of the ERAD protein GRP94 which
may suggest that compensatory effects in certain cell
type specific or metabolic situations are possible when
ERp57 is downregulated. We also demonstrate that a
minor proportion of ERp57 is localized in the cytoplasm
where it promotes cell growth and proliferation at least
partly via activation of mTOR irrespective of the p53
status. Importantly, p53-dependent and p53-independent
effects were synergistic which suggests that the effect of
ERp57 inhibition is reduced in a p53-deficient cellular
background but not eliminated. Taken together, our study
provides compelling evidence that inhibition of ERp57
affects proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells and that
the development of specific inhibitors for ERp57 could
help to improve the outcome of future cancer therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents, cell culture, transfection and
lentiviral transduction
PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 was from Millipore.
All other chemical compounds were from Sigma. MDAMB-231 and HEK293T cells were cultured in highglucose DMEM (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany).
HCT116 p53+/+ and isogenic p53-/- cell lines (generously
provided by B. Vogelstein, Baltimore, MD) were cultured
in McCoy`s 5A medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
Media were supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
For transient transfection TurboFect (Thermo Scientific)
was used. Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T
cells as described previously [56]. For transduction 2 × 105
cells were incubated with 2 × 106 transduction units for
16–24 h in the presence of 8 μg/μl polybrene. Cells were
selected by treatment with the appropriate concentration
of puromycin for approximately 10 d. pLKO.1-shRNAERp57 tet-on (tetracycline inducible) contained the
sequence
GGAATAGTCCCATTAGCAAAG
of
ERp57 mRNA (GenBank acc. no. NM_005313). Gene
knockdown was induced by addition of 250 ng/ml
doxycycline.

Apoptosis quantification

Clonogenic survival assay

Caspase-3 activity was quantified as described
previously [57]. Release of fluorescent 7-amino-4methylcoumarin (AMC) after cleavage from Ac-DEVDAMC was quantified over 4 h. Apoptosis was also
quantified by flow cytometry with Annexin V and PI. For
staining 1 × 105 cells were incubated with 80 μg/ml PI
and 9.6 μg/ml Annexin V conjugated to PacificBlue (No.
640917, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) in Annexin
V binding buffer (No. 422201, Biolegend) for 15 min
at room temperature. Cells were analysed on a FACS
Canto II (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
10000 cells per sample were analysed. Data analysis was
performed using FCS Express 4 Flow software (De Novo
Software, Los Angeles, CA, USA).

Depending on the experiment planned, 100 or
up to 6400 cells in exponential growth were seeded in
collagen precoated 6 well dishes. ERp57 knockdown was
induced and cells were incubated for 16 h. The cells were
irradiated with 1 or 3 Gy and incubated for 10 d. Cells
were fixed with 0.25% paraformaldehyde and 70% ethanol
and stained with Coomassie. Colonies of more than
50 cells were counted manually. Survival was calculated
as number of colonies divided by cells seeded x plating
efficiency as described previously [58].

Immunofluorescence
To study the subcellular localization of ERp57,
1 × 105 HCT116 cells were seeded onto glass cover slides
coated with rat collagen-I (Biozol, Eching, Germany).
pEGFP-N1-ERp57 encoding ERp57 with a C-terminal
GFP was generated by PCR cloning. Following
transfection cells were treated as indicated, incubated
with 1 μM ER-Tracker™ Blue-White DPX (Invitrogen)
and 5 μM DRAQ5™ (Thermo Scientific), fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and analysed using a Zeiss LSM510
confocal microscope.

Cell cycle analysis
For cell cycle analysis 4 × 105 cells treated as
indicated were lysed in 400 μl hypotonic citrate buffer
(0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing
50  μg/ml PI for 30–60 min. Following staining, intact
nuclei (as discriminated by PE-area versus PE-width
gating) were directly analysed for DNA content by FACS.
30000 (HCT116) or 50000 (MDA-MB-231) nuclei per
sample were analysed.

Cellular fractionation
To separate the cytoplasm from other cellular
compartments HCT116 cells were suspended in hypertonic
buffer (5 mM sucrose, 1 mM HEPES pH 7.4) containing
50 μg/ml digitonin for 90 sec. The cytoplasmic fraction
was collected following centrifugation with 800 × g for
1 min. Residual compartments were lysed in RIPA.

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Whole cell extracts were prepared in RIPA lysis
buffer and processed for Western blotting essentially as
described previously [57]. Monoclonal antibodies used
for p53 and MDM2 were from Millipore (Billerica, MA,
USA) or Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX, USA), respectively.
All other primary antibodies were polyclonal. Detailed
antibody information is available from the authors upon
request. For co-IP, 300 μg of whole cell lysates were
incubated with 0.5 μg p53 antibody. Control IPs were
performed with the same amount of mouse IgG2a isotype
control.

XBP1 splicing
Total RNA from HCT116 cells was prepared
using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Reverse transcription was performed using the iScript™
Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). For detection of spliced and unspliced XBP1
cDNA PCR was performed using forward primer
5′-AAACAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGC-3′ and reverse
primer 5′-CCTTCTGGGTAGACCTCTGGGAG-3′. The
PCR products of XBP1 and β-actin were visualized on
2.5% agarose gels.

Cell proliferation
To assess cell proliferation 2 × 105 HCT116 or
3 × 105 MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in P60 cell
culture dishes. To study effects of chemotherapy on
proliferation, 1 × 105 cells were reseeded in P60 cell
culture dishes following incubation with etoposide or
5-fluorouracil on day 5 for 4 h. To assess the influence of
irradiation on proliferation, 1 × 105 cells were reseeded in
P60 cell culture dishes 24 h after irradiation with 3 Gy on
day 4. When control samples were confluent, cells were
stained with trypan blue and viable cells counted using a
Cellometer™ Auto T4 (Peqlab).

Reporter gene assays
5 × 104 cells were seeded into 24-well plates.
24 h after knockdown induction, the cells were either
co-transfected with 500 ng of the reporter plasmid
p5xATF6-GL3 (#11976, Addgene) and 100 ng pGL4.74
(expressing renilla luciferase) or transfected with
pFLAG-XBP1u-FLuc (#31239, Addgene). 16–24 h after

39258

transfection cells were treated as indicated. Firefly and
renilla luciferase activities were quantified using a DualLuciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) on a TD 20/20
luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
