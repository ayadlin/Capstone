ABSTRACT
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the first line component used in colorectal cancer (CRC)
therapy however even in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs recurrence
is common. Mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are considered as
the initiating step of transformation in familial and sporadic CRCs. We have previously
shown that APC regulates the cellular response to DNA replication stress and recently
hypothesized that APC mutations might therefore influence 5-FU resistance. To test
this, we compared CRC cell lines and show that those expressing truncated APC
exhibit a limited response to 5-FU and arrest in G1/S-phase without undergoing
lethal damage, unlike cells expressing wild-type APC. In SW480 APC-mutant CRC
cells, 5-FU-dependent apoptosis was restored after transient expression of full length
APC, indicating a direct link between APC and drug response. Furthermore, we could
increase sensitivity of APC truncated cells to 5-FU by inactivating the Chk1 kinase
using drug treatment or siRNA-mediated knockdown. Our findings identify mutant APC
as a potential tumor biomarker of resistance to 5-FU, and importantly we show that
APC-mutant CRC cells can be made more sensitive to 5-FU by use of Chk1 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

interactions and function. APC regulates normal function
of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway [4, 7, 8] and
also distinct from this pathway, functions as a mediator
of apoptosis, cell cycle transition and the DNA damage/
replication stress response and repair which influences
its tumor suppressor activity [7-9]. We have previously
reported that full-length APC contributes to the cellular
response to DNA replication stress by stabilizing the
association of replication protein A (RPA) complexes at
stalled DNA replication forks after hydroxyurea treatment
[10].
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a pyrimidine analogue
that induces a DNA replication stress response in cells
through its ability to inhibit thymidylate synthase.
5-FU is a baseline component of many first-line cancer
chemotherapy regimens and even when it is used in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents,
recurrence is common in CRC, especially in patients
with metastasis due to the development of drug

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most
lethal cancer in the world and affects both men and
women. CRC results from complex interactions between
inherited susceptibility and environmental or lifestyle
factors [1, 2]. CRC develops through a sequential process
often triggered in the initial step by mutations of the
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor
gene [3-5]. Single allele germ-line APC mutations are
early events that lead to familial adenomatous polyposis,
a relatively benign polyp syndrome, whereas mutation
of both APC alleles predisposes to high risk of CRC [6].
CRC is one of the few cancers in which the initiation of
tumor formation can be attributed to mutations of a single
gene. Most APC mutations induce premature translation
termination resulting in shortened N-terminal APC
fragments that lack C-terminal sequences. Such truncated
APC peptides display altered cellular localization, protein

resistance [1, 11]. Therefore there is an intense interest
in identifying strategies to enhance the initial response
and/or to neutralize the emergence of resistance to 5-FU.
A possible approach to increase 5-FU sensitivity is the
pharmacological inhibition of DNA replication checkpoint
signaling. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a key DNA
damage checkpoint regulator activated by phosphorylation
in two residues (Ser317 and Ser345) via ataxia telangiectasia
and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase in response to singlestrand DNA (ssDNA) produced either as intermediate
forms of DNA damage or during stalled replication when
dNTP levels are disrupted [12]. Numerous Chk1 small
molecule inhibitors have been developed to enhance the
activity of DNA-damaging agents but limited information
exists about their role in the replication checkpoint
induced by 5-FU in CRC cells [13-15].
In this work we report that CRC cell lines carrying
APC mutations exhibit a reduced sensitivity to 5-FU. Cell
apoptosis was restored by reconstituting the expression of
full-length APC, implicating mutant APC as a determinant
of cancer cell resistance to 5-FU. Moreover, our analysis
of the response of APC-mutant cells to 5-FU revealed that
(1) sensitivity to this drug was enhanced by inhibition of
Chk1 kinase and (2) mutant APC at least partly contributes
to the cell response to combined 5-FU and Chk1 inhibitor
treatment by causing an increase in DNA replication fork
stalling and/or collapse to trigger an apoptotic response.

expression, since p53 is also mutated in several of
the CRC lines analyzed, we knocked down wild type
APC by siRNA in HCT116 cell lines wild-type or null
for p53 and observed that APC depletion reversed the
5-FU-dependent induction of PARP cleavage in parental
HCT116 cells similar to that observed in p53 null cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus, loss of full length
APC can cause resistance to 5-FU. In order to determine
if this was more than just a correlation, we examined
whether the expression of wild-type APC in SW480 cells
restored sensitivity to 5-FU. Cell death was determined
on a cell-by-cell basis by Hoechst staining of nuclei to
detect apoptotic DNA condensation. Increased SW480
cell apoptosis with 36 h 5-FU treatment was detected in
the GFP wild type APC expressing cells compared to GFP
controls (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Moreover, to provide further evidence that the
decrease in 5-FU sensitivity is caused by APC mutations,
we induced the expression of Myc-tagged APC mutant
(Myc-APCN1309) with tetracycline in a stable-transfected
HEK293 cell line. This non-tumor epithelial cell line was
sensitive to 25 µM 5-FU treatment and the expression
of Myc-APCN1309 was observed to reverse the PARPcleavage induced by 5-FU (Supplementary Fig. S3). This
further indicates that expression of the mutant truncated
form of APC can confer some resistance to 5-FU
treatment. These results suggest first that CRC cells are
differentially sensitive to 5-FU, and second that CRC cell
lines carrying APC mutations are particularly resistant to
5-FU treatment.

RESULTS
Colon cancer cells exhibit differential sensitivity
to 5-FU treatment depending on APC status

Chk1/2 inhibition sensitizes SW480 APC mutant
CRC cells to 5-FU

To compare the effect of 5-FU on cell death and cell
cycle arrest, we used flow cytometry analysis to detect
changes in cell cycle profiles in two well characterized
CRC cell lines: SW480 (express mutant APC) and
HCT116 (express wild-type APC) cells. Following
exposure to different concentrations of 5-FU for 36 h,
substantial cell death (>35 % of cells) was observed in
HCT116 cells using as little as 25 µM 5-FU whereas
SW480 cells were resistant to the effects of 5-FU at all
doses up to 100 µM (see sub-G1 peak in Fig. 1A). We
observed that HCT116 cells accumulated in S phase after
drug treatment while SW480 cells remained arrested at the
G1/S boundary without undergoing lethal damage (Fig.
1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). We further evaluated the
expression of PARP-cleavage by immunoblot analysis
to confirm cell death by apoptosis in a panel of colon
cancer cell lines. PARP-cleavage was clearly detectable
by 5-FU treatment in cell lines expressing full-length
APC (HCT116, LIM1215) but not in APC mutant cells
(SW480, CaCo 2, HT29) (Fig. 1B).
To compare the impact of APC with that of p53

Next, we investigated whether the sensitivity to
5-FU in APC mutant CRC cells could be increased by
further disruption of the DNA replication checkpoint.
When the DNA is damaged during S phase, Chk1 plays a
prominent role in restraining initiation of DNA replication.
Both APC and Chk1 are involved in the cellular response
to DNA replication stress through their association with
the 32 kDa subunit of the replication protein A (RPA) [16]
[10, 12]. Thus, we tested the pharmacological inhibition
of Chk1 as a potential approach to trigger an apoptotic
response in mutant APC CRC cells that were arrested
with 5-FU. We first confirmed that 5-FU induced ATRmediated phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317 and Ser345
in SW480 cells (Fig. 2A) and showed that the level of
phosphorylation observed was higher than that seen in
HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that
APC-mutant SW480 cells may be more reliant on the
Chk1 checkpoint pathway. Next, we investigated whether
AZD7762, an ATP competitive Chk1/2 inhibitor, was able
to sensitize SW480 cells to 5-FU. After addition of 100
nM AZD7762 alone, the Chk1 phosphorylation level (Fig.

Selective Chk1 inhibition sensitizes CRC cells to
5-FU induced apoptosis

2A) and level of apoptosis (Fig. 2B) was only weakly
enhanced, however when used in combination with 5-FU
it induced a striking~15-fold increase of apoptotic nuclei
compared to cells treated with 5-FU alone (Fig. 2B). The
combined action of AZD7762 and 5-FU also stimulated
PARP cleavage in SW480 cells (Fig. 2C). The pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK reduced PARP cleavage
and the number of apoptotic nuclei, confirming that this is
a caspase-dependent apoptotic process (Fig. 2C and data
not shown). The results suggest that 5-FU induces Chk1
phosphorylation, and that Chk1/2 inhibition by AZD7762
treatment sensitizes SW480 APC mutant cells to 5-FUmediated apoptosis.

Since AZD7762 inhibits both Chk1 and Chk2
kinases, we tested more selective Chk1 inhibitors. The
treatment of SW480 cells with the Chk1 inhibitor MK8776 (SCH900776) was also found to sensitize cells to
5-FU, and the combined action of the two drugs increased
the number of apoptotic cells and PARP cleavage product
with an impact similar to that of AZD7762 (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. S5). In parallel experiments another
Chk1 inhibitor, IC-83 (LY2603618), elicited similar results
(Fig. 3A). In contrast, the selective Chk2 inhibitor (Chk2

inhibitor II) was not able to sensitize SW480 cells to 5-FU
(Fig. 3B) despite confirmation of its activity by reduction
of p53 Ser20 phosphorylation a known substrate of
Chk2 (Supplementary Fig. S6). The efficacy of the Chk1
inhibitor MK-8776 was confirmed by immunoblotting, and
the drug was shown to inhibit Chk1 autophosphorylation
(Ser296) that is required for reducing Chk1 activity, but had
little effect on ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig.
3C). We also investigated the phosphorylation of histone
gamma-H2AX, a downstream signal for checkpoint
abrogation and marker for both single strand and double
strand breaks. 5-FU and MK-8776 alone each induced
only a slight increase in gamma-H2AX levels in control

cells, whereas the combination of both drugs caused a
dramatic increase in gamma-H2AX signal consistent with
an enhanced cell death induced by 5-FU (Fig. 3C). To
ensure that the effects of Chk1 inhibitor observed were
a direct consequence of Chk1, the expression of Chk1
was down-regulated by using short interference RNA
(siRNAs) and evaluated by immunoblotting. Neither 5-FU
nor Chk1 siRNA alone induced apoptosis. In contrast,
the combination of 5-FU and Chk1 siRNA increased
the number of condensed nuclei to levels similar to that
observed after Chk1 inhibition by drug treatment (Fig. 3D
and Supplementary Fig. S7).
Finally, we tested the specific Chk1 inhibitor

combined with a much lower 5-FU concentration of 2.5
µM, considered within the clinical therapeutic range
in CRC [17]. Even at this concentration, a significant
sensitization to 5-FU was observed in all APC-mutant
CRC cell lines tested, particularly in HT29 cells (Fig. 3E).
Notably, this low dose 5-FU combination did not adversely
affect normal epithelial HEK293 cells or HDF1314
fibroblasts, providing an indicator of a therapeutic window
(Supplementary Fig. S8A). HCT116 cells expressing
wild type APC displayed a more modest response to the
combination drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8B).
This result demonstrates that the efficacy of 5-FU may be
enhanced by Chk1 inhibitors in CRC cell lines expressing
APC truncations, although it should be noted that the

5-FU sensitivity of cells after over expression of wild
type APC was not further enhanced by inhibition of Chk 1
(Supplementary Fig. S8C).

Chk1 inhibition allows 5-FU-treated SW480 cells
to stimulate the collapse of stalled replication
forks to trigger an apoptotic response
In further experiments we examined the underlying
process involved in the sensitization to 5-FU by Chk1
inhibitors. Chk1 activation is triggered by formation of
RPA-ssDNA regions which are considered early events
in the response to DNA replication stress [18]. Therefore,

we used fluorescence microscopy to detect RPA foci and
BrdU incorporation as markers of replication stress and
DNA synthesis, respectively. Indeed, as expected (Fig.
4A), 5-FU treatment alone caused an increase in nuclear
RPA foci (detected with antibody against the middle
subunit RPA32), and this was increased dramatically in
the presence of the Chk1 inhibitor. The accumulation
of RPA32 foci correlated with an increase in BrdU

incorporation (Fig. 4B). This data suggest that while the
unregulated origin firing may lead to an increase in DNA
synthesis it may also be possible that the drug-induced
stalling and collapse of the replication forks generate
more ssDNA to which RPA is able to bind. Moreover, the
prolonged increase in ssDNA may provide more substrate
for repair synthesis, leading to greater BrdU incorporation.
By flow cytometry analysis, the proposed impairment

of the replication checkpoint by 5-FU combined with
MK-8776 correlated with a reduction in the percentage
of cells in S phase and an increase of those in Sub-G1
(Fig 4C). Similar results were observed using AZD7762
(Supplementary Fig. S9). These results are consistent
with the notion that while 5-FU arrests SW480 cells in
early S-phase at DNA replication, the addition of the Chk1
inhibitor appears to increase the concentration of ssDNA
consistent with prolonged stalling/collapse of replication
forks, and thus the cells exposed to 5-FU are unable to
complete the cycle of DNA synthesis and subsequently
undergo apoptosis.

cells to combined 5-FU and Chk1 inhibitor treatment.

DISCUSSION
The effectiveness of 5-FU has improved the
overall survival rates of colon cancer patients however
there are serious limitations such as widespread tumor
resistance and toxicity, resulting in a narrow therapeutic
window [1, 2]. Therefore, the predicted efficacy of 5-FU
using reliable biomarkers and more effective strategies
is needed. Here we have identified one such biomarker
and provide in vitro evidence that the presence of APC
mutations prevents 5-FU sensitivity. Indeed, we show that
the loss of wild type APC and the expression of mutant
truncated APC both contribute to 5-FU resistance, while
reinstating expression of full-length APC restores 5-FU
induced apoptosis. Thus in future, the restoration of APC
through techniques such as gene therapy or the induction
of read-through stop codons may be of therapeutic benefit
for APC-mutant cancers [19]. In this work, we report that
targeting the DNA replication checkpoint followed by
Chk1 inhibition overcomes 5-FU resistance in mutant
APC cells and this has potentially far reaching clinical
implications, as combination drug therapies might benefit
those patients currently not responding to 5-FU.
Chk1 knock down by siRNA was previously shown
to enhance cell death in HeLa and in CRC to arrest cell
growth [20, 21]. However, this kinase has critical roles
in a broad range of cellular processes therefore our
findings indicate that the transient inhibition of Chk1 by
small molecules may be preferable to the toxic effects
caused by permanent Chk1 ablation. Chk1 inhibitors
have previously been tested in a range of cancer cell
lines and shown to varying extents to improve cellular
sensitivity to different DNA damaging chemotherapeutic
agents in some cases boosting sensitivity to agents such
as hydroxyurea or gemcitabine but not to 5-FU in CRC
[22-24]. Moreover, Guzi et al. reported that MK-8776 in
combination with hydroxyurea did not lead to a dramatic
increase of cell death in WS1 fibroblasts, suggesting
that certain combinations of Chk1 inhibitors and DNA
replication blockers may selectively target specific types
of cancer cells [23], as further revealed in this study. Here,
we showed for the first time that mutant APC is involved
in the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway by protecting
cells from 5-FU cytotoxicity. We also found that in
certain APC-mutant CRC cell lines the pharmacologic
inhibition of Chk1 can magnify 5-FU efficacy and that
the continued expression of truncated APC protein
contributes to this process, driving cells to undergo
apoptosis. The overcoming of 5-FU resistance was
accompanied by increased expression of early markers
of DNA replication stress events such as RPA32 and
gamma-H2AX, suggesting that the replication checkpoint
is rapidly compromised and can occur before cells enter in
apoptosis. The increase in cell death that we observed was

Mutant APC has a gain-of-function effect and
contributes to optimal apoptotic response to 5-FU
after Chk1 inhibition in SW480 cells
We earlier showed that not only did loss of wildtype APC increase resistance of HCT116 CRC cells
to the effects of 5-FU (Supplementary Fig. S2A), but
that overexpression of mutant APC(1-1309) could
increase 5-FU resistance in non-tumor HEK293 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the influence of
mutant APC expression on the overcoming of 5-FU
resistance after Chk1 inhibition was unclear. To address
this, we first silenced mutant APC in SW480 cells using
different siRNAs to control for off-target effects and
compared the response to 5-FU drug alone. APC depletion
was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S10). As shown in Fig. 5A, down-regulation of
mutant APC did not enhance the response to 5-FU alone,
indicating that continued expression of APC mutants is not
always required to maintain drug resistance. Conversely,
the depletion of mutant APC decreased the level of
apoptosis mediated by 5-FU in presence of MK-8776 in
SW480 cells, reducing it from ~40% to ~25% (Fig. 5A).
This indicates that continued expression of mutant APC
partially contributes to overcoming 5-FU resistance on
addition of the Chk1 inhibitor. Under similar conditions a
decrease of PARP-cleavage was detected upon knockdown
of mutant APC (Fig. 5B), and this correlated with a
reduction in BrdU incorporation (Fig. 5C).
Next, we tested the impact of overexpressing
mutant APC in normal cells. Myc-tagged APC(N1309)
was induced by tetracycline in a stable HEK293 cell
line. The expression of mutant APC had little effect on
HEK293 cells treated with either 5-FU or MK-8776 alone,
however in cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and
Chk1 inhibitor the induction of mutant APC induced both
PARP-cleavage and RPA foci formation (Fig. 5D and E).
This response was only observed after induction of the
APCN1309 mutant and resembled the effects of the drugs
seen in SW480 cells (Fig’s. 3 and 4). When considered
together, the data suggest that continued expression of
mutant APC contributes to enhanced sensitivity of SW480

also achieved using therapeutically relevant concentrations
of 5-FU, indicating that the potential side effects and costs
often associated with CRC treatment could be minimized
and controlled.
Chk2 is also activated by ATR/ATM kinases and
shares some common substrates with Chk1. Although our
findings excluded an apoptotic role for Chk2 inhibition, we
do not rule out the possibility that Chk2 may be involved
in other aspects different from checkpoint replication such
as DNA repair [25, 26].
The mechanisms by which cellular apoptosis and
DNA replication stress are potentiated or retarded by APC
mutants remain unresolved. Several chemotherapeutic
agents that inhibit DNA replication such as methylmethane
sulfonate (MMS) and oxaliplatin also impair the DNA
base excision repair (BER) system and promote apoptosis.
It was shown that APC binds to polymerase beta and
contributes to enhance the action of these drugs by
inhibiting the BER system. However, the effectiveness
of these treatments is impaired in APC-mutant cancers
as a result of a functional BER capacity and should be
considered when these drugs are administrated [27, 28]. A
recent report suggests that the homologous recombination
repair (HRR) process has multiple functions at stalled
replication forks and can contribute to 5-FU tolerance in
DT40 B lymphoma cells. Chk1 inhibition was found to
exacerbate the effect of 5-FU by stimulating formation
of H2AX foci and cytotoxicity, not only in wild type
cells but also in HRR-deficient cells indicating that
further understanding of how the ATR-Chk1 pathway
impacts on 5-FU toxicity has implications for a range
of cancers including those with APC mutations [29].
Future experiments will determine the overlap between
mutant APC and Chk1 and whether APC regulates Chk1dependent replication stress and repair.
We and others reported that a decrease of mutant
APC levels achieved by siRNA impairs the regulation of
DNA replication checkpoint components such as RPA32
and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and also
showed that APC associates with PCNA and RPA32 [10,
30]. A decrease in the number of DNA replication foci
after Chk1 inhibition in APC depleted cells could indicate
that mutant APC may promote an increase stalling/
collapse of replication forks in the APC-mutant CRC cells,
as suggested by increased ssDNA detected by RPA and
BrdU assays. Such changes may stimulate apoptosis.
The effect of 5-FU on cell growth arrest and
apoptosis was previously attributed to the ability of this
drug to induce the expression and activity of the tumor
suppressor p53 linked to later stages of tumorigenesis [31,
32]. In this study we compared the effects of depleting
either wild-type APC or p53 in HCT116 CRC cells, and
found that loss of either protein increased resistance to
5-FU treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, although
mutations in p53 are also frequent in colon cancer, the
fact that Chk1 inhibition can influence cell apoptosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

independent of p53 status suggests that a strategy
combining Chk1 inhibitors with 5-FU may be a novel
alternative to treat CRC with both APC and p53 mutations
[23, 25, 33]. In conclusion, these data have identified
mutant APC as a tumor biomarker that may predict poor
responders to the common 5-FU treatment and we propose
that the inhibition of Chk1 targeting selectively APCmutant populations in colon cancer cells may provide a
more effective strategy for chemosensitization to 5-FU.

Small interfering RNA transfection (siRNAs)
Cells were plated at 50 % of confluence in 25
cm2 and transfected using LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen)
according to supplier instructions. After 6 h, medium
was replaced and drug treatment was applied for 36 h.
The siRNA were: Human Chk1 siRNA SMART pool or
RNA duplexes (combination of 3 of them to avoid offtargets responses) (Dharmacon Technology); doublestranded-21-mer RNA oligonucleotides homologous to
9897

Oncotarget

Immunofluorescence analysis

sequences in human APC and siRNA control (Qiagen)
were: APC#1 5′-AACGAGCACAGCGAAGAATAG-3′
corresponding to nucleotides 691–714, APC#2
5′-AGGGGCAGCAACTGATGAAAA-3′
corresponding to nucleotides 5887–5896 and APC#3
(5′-AGCCGGGAAGGATCTGTATCA-3′ nucleotides
330-350). The sequence used as control was:
5′-AACGAGCAGTCGCTTCAATAG-3′.

After treatment, floating and adherent cells were
combined by centrifugation and the pellets were washed
and suspend in PBS.

Cells were seeded on coverslips at 50 % confluence
24 h prior to the addition of drugs for 36 h. Before
fixation BrdU pulse was applied and the cells were
incubated for 1 h with cell proliferation labelling reagent
Bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (# RPN201, Amersham,
GE Healthcare). In those assays designed for BrdU and
RPA32 detection the cells were first treated for 5 min on
ice with CSK buffer (10 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 300
mM sucrose, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 % Triton
X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail)
buffer to achieve better visualization of foci and then fixed
with 3.7 % formaldehyde for 20 min. Antibody dilutions
and washes after incubations were performed in PBS
containing 1 % BSA. Cells were fixed and stained with
Hoechst to detect the nuclear condensation. Coverslips
were finally mounted in Vectashield mounting medium
(H-1500; Vector Laboratories). A SPOT camera and SPOT
Advanced software was used for general image capture.
For the experiment showed in Figure 1C and Figure 5E,
Olympus DeltaVision core deconvolution microscope
with SoftworxResolve 3D software was used for advanced
imaging analysis. Deconvolved cell images were compiled
in Adobe Photoshop CS.

Plasmid transfection
The plasmid GFP wild type APC (APC amino acids
1–2843): was kindly supplied by Dr. Angela Barth. GFP
wild type p53 plasmid (12091, Addgene) [35]. The cells
were seeded at 75 % confluence and transfected with 1
μg/ml of DNA using FuGENE HD reagent as instructed
by the supplier (Promega). After 6 h, the medium was
replaced with the drug treatment for 36 h.

Cell collection and processing

20 % of the above suspension was fixed in 85 %
iced-cold ethanol, and stored at -20 °C for up 2 weeks for
flow cytometry analysis. After centrifugation to remove
the ethanol the pellets were suspended in PBS containing
50 µg/ml RNAase A (Worthington), 50 µg/ml propidium
iodide (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Flow
cytometry was carried out using FACSalibur (Becton
Dickinson) and Modifit LT 3.1 and Cell Quest software.
At least 7000 events were gated.

-Western Blotting
80 % of the initial cell suspension was pellet and
lysed with RIPA buffer. The protein suspension was
centrifuged and the supernatants collected and protein
quantified using a Bradford solution. Equal amount of
protein were separated via SDS-PAGE and then transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (1 x TBS, 3 % milk,
0.1 % Tween 20) and placed in primary antibody diluted
in blocking buffer, overnight at 4 °C. The following day,
membranes were washed three times in wash buffer (0.1
% Tween 20, 1 x TBS). Primary antibody was detected
using horseradish peroxidase linked secondary antibodies
and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
detection reagents according to manufacturer instructions
(Amersham).
