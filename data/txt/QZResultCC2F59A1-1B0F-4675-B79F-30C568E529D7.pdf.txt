ABSTRACT
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which accounts for nearly 90% of head and
neck cancers, is characterized by a poor prognosis and a low survival rate. Vascular
endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) has been implicated in lymphangiogenesis and
is correlated with cancer metastasis. WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1
(WISP)-1/CCN4 is an extracellular matrix-related protein that belongs to the CCN
family and stimulates many biological functions. Our previous studies showed that
WISP-1 plays an important role in OSCC migration and angiogenesis. However, the
effect of WISP-1 on VEGF-C regulation and lymphangiogenesis in OSCC is poorly
understood. Here, we showed a correlation between WISP-1 and VEGF-C in tissue
specimens from patients with OSCC. To examine the lymphangiogenic effect of
WISP- 1, we used human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to mimic lymphatic
vessel formation. The results showed that conditioned media from WISP-1-treated
OSCC cells promoted tube formation and cell migration in LECs. We also found that
WISP-1-induced VEGF-C is mediated via the integrin αvβ3/integrin-linked kinase
(ILK)/Akt signaling pathway. In addition, the expression of microRNA-300 (miR-300)
was inhibited by WISP-1 via the integrin αvβ3/ILK/Akt cascade. Collectively, these
results reveal the detailed mechanism by which WISP-1 promotes lymphangiogenesis
via upregulation of VEGF-C expression in OSCC. Therefore, WISP-1 could serve as
therapeutic target to prevent metastasis and lymphangiogenesis in OSCC.

INTRODUCTION

are inadequate [4]. Hence, investigating how to reduce
invasion and metastasis in OSCC may facilitate the
development of effective adjuvant therapies.
The metastatic spread of tumor cells is associated with
resistance to conventional therapies and is the leading cause
of death for cancer patients. Tumor metastasis comprises
many processes, such as proliferation [5], migration [6],
invasion [7], angiogenesis [8], and lymphangiogenesis [9].
Lymphangiogenesis is a key step during tumor metastasis.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) represents
1–2% of all human malignancies and is the most prevalent
type of oral cancer [1, 2]. Approximately 50% of patients
with OSCC present with lymph node metastasis at the
time of diagnosis. Therefore, OSCC has a poor prognosis
and a low survival rate [3]. The current 5-year survival
rate is approximately 50% because the available therapies

RESULTS

Therefore, inhibition of cancer-mediated lymphangiogenesis
has been proposed for blocking the spread of cancer [10].
In addition, identification of the mechanisms underlying
tumor lymphangiogenesis may aid in developing new
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of many types of
cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C)
is the best-characterized lymphangiogenic factor. It
has been reported that VEGF-C plays a crucial role in
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis [11, 12].
Futhermore, many studies have noted that VEGF-C
regulates lymphangiogenesis in many types of cancer cells,
such as colon [13], colorectal [14], acute myeloid leukemic
[15], and lung cancer cells [16].
Proteins in the Cyr61, CTGF, Nov (CCN) family
are secreted extracellular matrix proteins and have been
demonstrated to play central roles in tumor survival,
proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis
[17, 18]. WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1
(WISP- 1), also termed CCN4, is a cysteine-rich protein
that is part of the CCN family, and has many cellular
functions [19, 20]. Increasing evidence has suggested that
WISP-1 is involved in tumorigenesis, and variation in its
expression has been observed in several types of cancer
[21, 22]. We previously reported that WISP- 1 increases
migration in OSCC through up-regulation of intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and promotes
angiogenesis via a VEGF-A-dependent pathway [23, 24],
implying that WISP-1 is involved in metastasis of OSCC.
Several studies have focused on the role of
microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer progression and
metastasis [25, 26]. miRNAs influence numerous
cancer-relevant processes such as proliferation,
apoptosis,
migration,
invasion,
angiogenesis,
and lymphangiogenesis [27]. miRNAs are short
noncoding RNA molecules, with an average length of
approximately 18 to 22 nucleotides. They bind to the
3′ untranslated region (3′- UTR) of mRNA through
complementary base pairing, resulting in mRNA
degradation or translation inhibition [28]. miRNAs
have been reported to inhibit tumor lymphangiogenesis
through dysregulation of the miR/VEGF-C axis
[29]. miR-128 has been documented to suppress
lymphangiogenesis in human non-small cell lung
cancer by directly inhibiting VEGF-C expression [30].
In addition, overexpression of miR-206 attenuates
VEGF-C levels and lymphangiogenesis in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [31]. However, the role of miRNA
in regulating WISP-1-mediated VEGF-C expression
in OSCC remains largely unknown. In the present
study, we have shown that WISP-1 promotes VEGF-C
expression in OSCC and subsequently enhances
lymphangiogenesis in lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs). In addition, miR- 300 is inhibited by WISP-1
via the integrin αvβ3/integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/Akt
signal pathway.

Clinical significance of WISP-1 and VEGF-C
expression in specimens from patients with
OSCC
Our previous studies indicated that WISP-1 is
associated with migration and angiogenesis in OSCC
cells [23, 24]. We also previously reported that OSCC
patients show higher expression of WISP-1 than healthy
individuals [23]. To examine the role of WISP- 
1
in OSCC lymphangiogenesis, we first analyzed the
expression profile of VEGF-C in specimens from patients
with OSCC using two submitted microarray datasets
(GSE3524 and GSE2280) that contain information from
47 patients with OSCC. As shown in Figure 1A, VEGF-C
expression level was higher in tumor specimens than
in normal tissues. Moreover, their expression level was
also higher in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors
(Figure 1B). In addition, IHC was performed in specimens
from 60 patients with OSCC. The results indicated that
VEGF-C expression was higher in tumor specimens
than in normal tissues and was correlated with tumor
stage (Figure 1C and 1D). Quantitative data also showed
that WISP-1 expression was correlated with VEGF-C
expression in human OSCC specimens (Figure 1E),
indicating that WISP-1 is associated with VEGF-C
expression and tumor stage in patients with OSCC.
In addition, the other CCN family members including
CCN1, CCN2, and CCN3 also were higher in tumor than
in normal (Supplementary Figure S1).

Involvement of VEGF-C expression in WISP-1directed lymphangiogenesis of OSCC cells
VEGF-C has been reported to mediate the
lymphangiogenesis of OSCC cells [32]. We therefore
examined whether VEGF-C is involved in WISP-1induced lymphangiogenesis of OSCC cells. Incubation
of two OSCC cell lines (SCC4 and SAS cells) increased
VEGF-C mRNA expression and protein secretion
(Figure 2A and 2B). To further confirm this stimulation
specific mediation by WISP-1 without endotoxin
contamination, polymyxin B, an LPS inhibitor, was
used. We found that polymyxin B (1 mM) did not reduce
WISP-1-induced VEGF-C expression (Supplementary
Figure S2). Lymphangiogenesis involves proliferation,
migration, and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial
cells (LECs) to form new lymph vessels [33]. We
then examined whether WISP-1-dependent VEGF-C
expression induced lymphangiogenesis using an in vitro
LEC model. Incubation of LECs with conditioned medium
(CM) from WISP-1-treated OSCCs dramatically enhanced
migration and tube formation in LECs (Figure 2C and 2D).
However, VEGF-C mAb but not control IgG abolished
WISP-1-mediated migration and tube formation in LECs

WISP-1 promotes VEGF-C production by
inhibiting miR-300 expression

(Figure 2C and 2D), implying that WISP-1 promotes
lymphangiogenesis via a VEGF-C-dependent pathway.
WISP-1 is known to affect cellular functions by binding to
the cell-surface integrin αvβ3 receptor [34]. Our previous
studies showed that integrin αvβ3 mediated WISP-1promoted cell migration and angiogenesis in OSCC cells
[23, 24]. Concordant with our previous results, integrin
αvβ3 antibody abolished WISP-1-induced VEGF-C
expression (Figure 2E and 2F). Thus, WISP-1 increased
VEGF-C expression and lymphangiogenesis in human
OSCC cells via the integrin αvβ3 receptor. Integrin
α5β1 has been reported to involve in WISP-1 signaling
[21], the integrin α5β1 antibody also reduced WISP-1increased VEGF-C expression (Supplementary Figure S3),
suggesting integrin α5β1 is also involved.

miRNAs are important regulators of tumor
angiogenesis, which makes them promising therapeutic
targets [37]. miRNA target prediction using open source
software (www.TargetScan.org and www.microrna.org)
revealed that the 3′-UTR of VEGF-C mRNA harbors
potential binding sites for miR-300. We found that
miR-300 was increased by WISP-1 shRNA infection in
two OSCC cell lines (Figure 4A). Exogenous WISP-1
also reduced miR-300 expression in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 4B). To explore miR-300
involvement in WISP-1-induced VEGF-C expression
and lymphangiogenesis, a miR-300 mimic was used;
transfection with the miR-300 mimic diminished WISP-1induced VEGF-C expression as well as migration and tube
formation in LECs (Figure 4C–4F). However, treatment
with integrin αvβ3 mAb, KP-392, and an Akt inhibitor
or ILK and Akt siRNA reversed WISP-1-inhibited miR300 expression (Figure 5A–5C), indicating that WISP-1
promotes VEGF-C expression and lymphangiogenesis by
suppressing miR-300 expression via the integrin αvβ3,
ILK, and Akt pathway.
To learn whether miR-300 inhibits VEGF-C via
the 3′-UTR, we constructed a luciferase reporter vector
harboring the wild-type 3′-UTR of VEGF-C mRNA (wtVEGFA-3′-UTR) and a vector containing mismatches
in the predicted miR-300 binding site (mt-VEGFA3′-UTR) (Figure 5D). The results show that WISP-1
increased luciferase activity in the wt-VEGF-C-3′-UTR
plasmid but not in the mt-VEGF-C-3′-UTR plasmid
(Figure 5E). In addition, transfection with the miR-300
mimic antagonized the WISP-1-increased luciferase
activity in the wt-VEGF-C-3′-UTR plasmid (Figure 5E).
Furthermore, treatment with an ILK and Akt inhibitor
or siRNA also diminished the WISP-1-promoted wtVEGF-C-3′-UTR luciferase activity (Figure 5F and 5G).
Collectively, these suggest that miR-300 directly represses
VEGF-C protein expression via binding to the 3′-UTR of
the human VEGF-C gene via ILK and Akt signaling.

WISP-1 promotes VEGF-C expression in OSCC
cells through the ILK/Akt pathway
ILK is a common downstream regulator of the
integrin signaling cascade [35]. We therefore analyzed
the effect of ILK on WISP-1-increased VEGF-C
expression in OSCC cells. Treatment with an ILK-specific
inhibitor (KP- 392) or transfection with an ILK siRNA
diminished WISP-1-increased VEGF-C expression
(Figure 3A and 3B). Next, we used GSK3β as a substrate
to measure ILK activity. Following WISP-1 stimulation,
ILK activity increased in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 3E), which was inhibited by pretreating the
cells with integrin αvβ3 mAb (Figure 3F). Thus, WISP1 appears to act via the integrin αvβ3/ILK signaling
pathway to promote VEGF-C expression in human OSCC
cells. ILK-dependent Akt activation has been documented
to participate in cancer metastasis [35, 36]. We next
examined whether ILK-dependent Akt activation was
involved in WISP- 1 induction of VEGF-C. Pretreatment
of cells with an Akt inhibitor or transfection of cells with
Akt siRNA both abolished WISP-1-induced VEGF-C
expression (Figure 3C and 3D). In addition, Akt inhibitor
did not affect cell viability in SCC4 and SAS cells (data
not shown). Furthermore, transfection with siRNA against
ILK and Akt reduced ILK and Akt expression, respectively
(Figure 3A and 3C Upper Panel). Akt phosphorylation
was increased after WISP-1 treatment (Figure 3E).
However, pretreatment with integrin αvβ3 mAb or KP- 392
markedly diminished WISP-1-induced ILK activity
and Akt phosphorylation (Figure 3F and 3G). Based on
these results, it appears that WISP-1 acts through the
integrin αvβ3, ILK, and Akt pathway to enhance VEGF-C
expression in OSCC cells. Next we examined the other
integrin binding proteins ICAP-1, ITGB1, and CIB1 in
WISP-1 promoting VEGF-C secretion, the results found
that infection with ICAP-1, ITGB1, and CIB1 shRNA also
reduced WISP-1-promoted VEGF-C expression, implying
these integrin binding proteins also involved in WISP-1promoted VEGF-C production (Supplementary Figure S4).

DISCUSSION
OSCC, which accounts for nearly 90% of head and
neck cancers, is characterized by a poor prognosis and a
low survival rate. Metastasis is the most common cause
of death [38]. Lymphangiogenesis is one of the major
routes for tumor invasion and metastasis. VEGF-C is a key
modulator in tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis,
and thus VEGF-C is a potential target for preventing
tumor lymphatic metastasis. The effects of WISP-1 on
OSCC migration and angiogenesis have previously been
discussed [23, 24]. Here, we provide novel insights on
the role of WISP-1 in lymphangiogenesis. In the current
study, we found that a high level of WISP-1 expression is

strongly correlated with VEGF-C expression and tumor
stage in OSCC patients. In addition, we also indicated
that the mRNA expression of VEGF-C, WISP-1, integrin
αv, integrin β3, ILK, Akt but not miR-300 were higher in
OSCC patients than in normal (Supplementary Figure S5
and S6). In summary, we showed that WISP-1 promotes
VEGF-C expression and increases lymphangiogenesis by
down-regulating miR-300 via the integrin αvβ3, ILK, and
Akt signaling pathway, indicating that WISP-1 a novel
target for inhibition of lymphangiogenesis in OSCC. We

previous reported knockdown WISP-1 reduced WISP-1
expression, angiogenesis and tumor growth [23]. We also
found knockdown WISP-1 diminished lymphangiogenesis
marker (LYVE-1), integrin αvβ3, ILK, and Akt expression
in vivo (Supplementary Figure S7), implying WISP-1/
integrin αvβ3/ILK/Akt/miR-300/VEGF-C axis plays key
role in lymphangiogenesis in vivo.
LECs are associated with the induction and
modulation of VEGF-C during tumor metastasis [39],
and lymphangiogenesis has recently garnered attention

as a possible therapeutic target for cancer patients [40].
However, whether LECs are involved in the regulation and
function of WISP-1 in OSCC remains largely unknown.
Growing evidence indicates that LECs are associated
with abnormal lymphangiogenesis via the induction and
modulation of VEGF-C [41, 42]. In the present study, we
found that CM from WISP-1-treated OSCC cells increased
migration and tube formation in LECs, implying that
WISP-1 enhances lymphangiogenesis in OSCC cells.
Furthermore, VEGF-C mAb diminished WISP-1-mediated
lymphangiogenesis, indicating that WISP-1 promotes
VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis in OSCC cells.
ILK, a candidate signaling molecule, has been
indicated to mediate integrin-regulated signaling [43].
Here we reported that treatment with an ILK inhibitor
or siRNA antagonized WISP-1-induced VEGF-C
expression. Incubation of OSCC cells with WISP-1
promoted ILK activity, suggesting that ILK activation
plays a crucial role in WISP-1-increased VEGF-C
production and lymphangiogenesis. However, Akt is
an important downstream mediator of ILK signaling
[44]. In the current study, inhibition of Akt with either a
pharmacological inhibitor or engineered siRNA reduced
VEGF-C production. We also found that WISP-1 enhanced
Akt phosphorylation, and was inhibited by KP- 392.
Collectively, these results show that ILK-dependent
Akt activation may play a key role in WISP-1-increased
VEGF-C expression and lymphangiogenesis. It has been
reported that transcriptional and posttranscriptional
regulation play key role in miRNA activation and
inhibition [45]. In the current study, cells incubation with
ILK and Akt inhibitor reversed WISP-1-reduced miR- 300
expression indicating WISP-1 inhibited miR- 
300
expression through ILK/Akt pathway. Whether ILK/Akt
control miR-300 expression through transcriptional or
posttranscriptional regulation is needs further examination.
Small noncoding miRNAs, a newly identified
novel class of gene regulators, control gene expression

by binding to complementary 3′-UTR sequences of target
mRNA [46, 47]. miR-300 has been reported to inhibit the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor metastasis
in human epithelial cancer via targeting of Twist [48];
miR-300 has also been shown to be a negative regulator
of differentiation in glioma stem-like cells [49], but its
effect on VEGF-C expression remains largely unknown.
We ranked the 8 miRNAs that harboring the binding sites
of VEGF-C. We found miR-300 was the most increased
after knockdown WISP-1 (Supplementary Figure S8).
We therefore examined the role of miR-300 in WISP-1mediated VEGF-C expression. Whether other miRNAs
(miR128, miR410 or 186) are involved in WISP-1induced VEGF-C expression needs further examination.
We observed that exogenous WISP-1 reduced miR- 300
expression. Cotransfection with a miR-300 mimic reduced
WISP-1-induced VEGF-C expression, as well as migration
and tube formation in LECs. In addition, we found that
miR-300 directly represses VEGF-C protein expression
through binding to the 3′-UTR of the human VEGF-C
gene, thereby negatively regulating VEGF-C-mediated
lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with an ILK
or an Akt inhibitor or siRNA reversed WISP-1-mediated
miR-300 expression as well as VEGF-C 3′-UTR activity,
implying that ILK and Akt are upstream mediators of
WISP-1 suppression of miR-300 expression.
The IHC results for clinical specimens from
patients with OSCC showed that WISP-1 and VEGF-C
expression levels were positively correlated with tumor
stage in OSCC. Using cellular-level experiments, we
also showed that WISP-1 promotes VEGF-C expression
and lymphangiogenesis in OSCC. In addition, WISP-1
promotes VEGF-C expression and lymphangiogenesis
by down-regulating miR-300 expression via the integrin
αvβ3, ILK, and Akt signaling pathways (Figure 6). Thus,
WISP-1 may be a new molecular therapeutic target for
reduction of lymphangiogenesis and metastasis in OSCC.

between passages 5 and 10 for experiments described
herein

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
A human OSCC tissue array was purchased from
Biomax (Rockville, MD, USA). The tissues were placed
on glass slides, rehydrated, and incubated in 3% hydrogen
peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After
trypsinization, sections were blocked by incubation in 3%
BSA in PBS. The primary monoclonal mouse anti-human
VEGF-C antibody was applied to the slides at a dilution of
1:50 and incubated at 4°C overnight. After being washed
3 times in PBS, the samples were treated with goat anti- mouse
IgG biotin-labeled secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:50.
Bound antibodies were detected using an ABC kit (Vector
Laboratories). The slides were stained with chromogen
diaminobenzidine, washed, counterstained with Delafield’s
hematoxylin, dehydrated, treated with xylene, and mounted.

ELISA assay
Cells (2 × 104) were cultured in 24-well plates and
incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C for 24 h.
After pretreatment with a pharmacological inhibitor or
transfection with siRNA, followed by stimulation with
WISP-1 for 24 h, the medium was removed and stored at
−80°C until the assay was performed. The VEGF-C level
in the medium was assayed using the VEGF-C enzyme
immunoassay kit (R & D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA),
according to the procedure described by the manufacturer.

Western blot analysis

followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s,
using the StepOnePlus sequence detection system. Relative
gene expression was quantified using an endogenous
control gene (U6). The threshold cycle (CT) was defined as
the fractional cycle number at which fluorescence passed
a fixed threshold, and relative expression was calculated
using the comparative CT method.

Cells were collected and lysed in cold RIPA buffer
with protein inhibitors, proteins were resolved using SDSPAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinyldifluoride
(PVDF) membranes. Blots were blocked with 4% BSA
for 1 h at room temperature, then probed with rabbit
anti-human antibodies against p-Akt or Akt (1:1000)
for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, blots
were subsequently incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000)
for 1 h at room temperature and visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence, using an Imagequant LAS 4000 (GE
Healthcare, Pewaukee, WI, USA) [50].

Plasmid constructs
The 3′-UTR-luciferase reporter constructs containing
the 3′-UTR regions of VEGF-C with wild-type and mutant
binding sites for miR-300 were amplified by PCR of cDNAs
obtained from H293T cells. PCR products were cloned into
a pmirGLO reporter vector (Promega) between the PmeI
and XhoI restriction sites, immediately downstream of the
luciferase reporter gene. Mutant 3′-UTRs were constructed
by introducing seven mismatched mutations into putative
seed regions of VEGF-C. All constructs were sequenced to
verify that they contained the 3′-UTR inserts.

ILK kinase activity assay
ILK enzymatic activity was assayed using OSCC
cells lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), as previously reported [44].
Briefly, ILK was immunoprecipitated from 250 mg of
lysate using an ILK antibody overnight at 4°C. After
immunoprecipitation, beads were resuspended in 30 ml of
kinase buffer containing 1 mg of recombinant substrate
(a GSK3β fusion protein) and 200 µM of ATP. The
reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30°C.
Phosphorylated substrate was visualized by western blot
analysis using an antibody against phospho-GSK3β. Total
GSK3β was also detected using the appropriate antibody.
Anti-ILK was used as a loading control.

Luciferase reporter assay
Cells were seeded on 12-well plates, then transiently
transfected with VEGF-C 3′-UTR luciferase plasmids
using Lipofectamine 2000, as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells collected were lysed with reporter lysis
buffer 24 h after transfection, and the luciferase and renilla
activities in the cellular extracts were determined using a
Dual-luciferase® reporter assay system. Relative luciferase
activity was calculated based on the ratio of luciferase/
renilla activity, and normalized to that of control cells.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of mRNA
and miRNA

Statistics
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses of pairs of samples
were performed using the Student’s t-test. Statistical
comparisons of more than two groups were performed
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. In all cases, P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

This analysis was conducted with Taqman® one-step
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), using 100 ng of
total cDNA per 25-μl reaction, using sequence-specific
primers and Taqman® probes. All target gene primers and
probes (GAPDH was used as an internal control) were
purchased commercially (Applied Biosystems). qPCR
assays were conducted in triplicate using a StepOnePlus
sequence detection system and the following cycling
conditions: 10 min of polymerase activation at 95°C
followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 60 s.
The threshold was set above the non-template control
background and within the linear phase of target gene
amplification to calculate the cycle number at which
transcript was detected (denoted as CT) [51].
For the miRNA assay, cDNA was synthesized from
total RNA (100 ng) using a TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were
incubated first at 16°C for 30 min and at 42°C for 30 min,
followed by inactivation at 85°C for 5 min, then incubated
in a 96-well plate at 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min,
