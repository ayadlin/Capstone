ABSTRACT
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has the added advantage of increasing breast
conservation rates with equivalent survival outcomes compared with adjuvant
chemotherapy. A subset of breast cancer patients who received NAC experienced
early failure (EF) during the course of therapy or within a short period after curative
breast surgery. In contrast, patients with pathological complete response (pCR) were
reported to have markedly favorable outcomes. This study was performed to identify
actionable mutation(s) and to explain refractoriness and responsiveness to NAC.
Included in this analysis were 76 patients among 397 with locally advanced breast
cancer for whom a preoperative fresh-frozen paraffin-embedded tumor block was
available for next-generation sequencing using AmpliSeq. The incidence of missense
mutations in KRAS was much higher in patients with EF than in other groups (p <
0.01). In contrast, polymorphisms of the cMET gene were found in patients with pCR
exclusively (p < 0.01).

the mechanisms of resistance to treatment, and provides
an attractive clinical setting to study the mechanisms
of drug resistance in vivo. Triple-negative breast cancer

higher rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) [1, 3].
In particular, standard polychemotherapy results in pCR
in more than 20% of patients [4, 5], and this response is
considered a surrogate of increased survival compared
with patients without pCR [6]. pCR to NAC indicates
an extremely chemotherapy-sensitive tumor and heralds
excellent long-term cancer-free survival [7]. Thus, it
is currently acknowledged as a surrogate end point for
therapeutic benefit, especially in HER2-positive BC and
TNBC [8].
In contrast, a subset of patients who receive
NAC experiences early failure (EF) during the course
of therapy or within a short period after curative breast
surgery. Recently, we conducted a retrospective analysis
to determine the incidence and predictors of EF after
NAC, with the ultimate aim of identifying patients who
may not benefit from NAC. We reported that 9.6 % of
the breast cancer patients who received NAC in our study
developed EF within 1 year, and that the post-failure
survival period of this group was shorter than that of
the late-failure group [9]. Patients who had HER2+ BC
or TNBC and the presence of lymphovascular invasion
had a high risk of EF after controlling for other clinical
and demographic variables [9]. There are no established
biological predictors of EF in locally advanced breast

cancer (LABC) patients who receive NAC compared with
pCR.
This study was performed to identify candidate
actionable mutation(s) to explain pCR and EF or
refractoriness to chemotherapy in BC patient groups that
may benefit to a greater extent, or not benefit from NAC.

RESULTS
Patient cohort
Recently, we reported data from 397 patients
who received NAC regarding the evaluation of the
clinicopathologic feature of patients with early failure as
well as pCR. These data were from the electronic database
of the Department of Medicine at the Samsung Medical
Center and from retrospectively reviewed records of 433
patients who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed
invasive breast cancer and received NAC at the Samsung
Medical Center from January 2005 to December 2011 [9].
Among these populations, 76 patients who had available
tissue for next generation sequencing (NGS) and nCounter
assay were included in this analysis (Figure 1).

Clinicopathological characteristics of the 76
patients with NAC

Next generation sequencing using Ampliseq with
> 1% for mutations with low allele fraction

The median age at diagnosis of the 76 patients
was 46 years (range, 28–63 years; Table 1). Among the
76 patients, 23 patients showed EF, 21 patients had pCR,
and the remaining 32 patients were regarded as controls.
The subtype distributions was as follows: patients with EF
were more likely to have HER2+ BC (39.1%) or TNBC
(47.8%). Patients with HR+ BC (ER+ and/or PgR+ and
HER2−) had no pCR, and HER2+ patients represented
57.2% of the pCR group. TNBC was present in 42.9% of
the patients in the pCR group.

Figure 2A shows the number of patients with
mutations in 50 genes among 76 patients. Fifty-one of
the 76 patients (67.1%) harbored at least one mutation
(Figure 2; MAF < 0.01). A total of 532 mutations were
detected in samples from 76 patients. Genes in which
somatic mutations were detected frequently included
TP53 (50 cases, 65.8%), APC (33 cases, 43.4%), RB1 (25
cases, 32.9%), SMAD4 (21 cases, 27.6%), KIT (20 cases,
26.3%), MET, (20 cases, 26.3%), PIK3CA (20 cases,
26.3%), ALK (16 cases, 21.1%), EGFR (15 cases, 19.7%),

PTEN (14 cases, 18.4%), CDKN2A (13 cases, 17.1%),
RET (10 cases, 15.8%), and VHL (10 cases, 15.8%), as
shown in Figure 2A. Figure 2B-2D shows the number of
samples and mutation proportions among the three groups,
respectively.
Figure 3A depicts the heat map of the mutations
detected in the 76 patients. Frameshift mutations in the
TP53 gene were observed more frequently in patients with
pCR than in those with EF (23.8% vs. 17.4%). Most of the
mutations were nonsynonymous.
KRAS alterations were found in six cases (7.9%)
among the 76 samples: five of those were detected in
patients with EF. However, there were no KRAS mutations
in patients with pCR (Table 2A, 2B; Figure 3B).

To seek polymorphisms, variants were collected
and are shown in Supplementary Figures 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D
and 2. Met alterations were significantly more frequent in
patients with pCR than they were in those with EF (Table
2C, 2D; Figure 3C).

DISCUSSION

general population and its lack of transforming abilities
[15, 16]. These findings are supported by recent reports
that the HGF/c-MET axis drives cancer aggressiveness
[12, 17]. Interestingly, PAM50 analysis using surrogate
IHC subtyping showed an even distribution of each
subtype between EF and pCR: HER2-enriched and basallike subtypes were distributed between EF and pCR evenly
(Figure 4A, 4B). c-MET mutation may be a plausible
explanation for this paradox. MET polymorphism in
tumors of the HER2-enriched and basal-like subtype may
contribute to responsiveness or refractoriness to NAC even
in the same intrinsic subtypes. Moreover, FOS expression
appeared to be higher in patients with EF; however, this
finding warrants validation in future research.

Paradoxically, our results showed that the
distribution of intrinsic subtypes, as assessed using
IHC, between the patients with pCR or EF appeared to
be similar even though they had a completely different
prognosis. In addition, the PAM50 gene set confirmed
this similarity between pCR or EF. Most of the patients
with pCR or EF were TNBC and HER2+ subtypes. This
represents the extreme tumor heterogeneity of breast
cancer, especially in patients with TNBC and HER2+
tumors. Obviously, characterizing pCR is of immense
importance and has clinical implications for patients with
LABC. For the same reasons, characterizing EF is crucial
because of its dismal prognosis in spite of its curable
clinical setting, as described in our previous report [9].
Thus, the development of useful predictors for prognostic
evaluation or for predicting chemotherapeutic response
is urgently needed and will have significant clinical
implications.
Therefore, proper treatment strategies for patients
with extreme different prognosis could be differentiated
after the characterization of pCR and EF in advance using
multi-omics on pre-chemotherapy biopsy tissues.
Our results showed that KRAS mutation was
enriched in patients with EF compared with pCR and
pCR plus control (21.7% vs. 0%, 21.7% vs. 1.8%) (Table
3A; Figure 3A, 3B). Patients with KRAS codon 12 and
13 mutations seemed to present a worse prognosis with
chemotherapy refractoriness and aggressive clinical
course, in spite of the curative clinical setting (Table
3A, 3B). The proportion of EF detected in this study
was classified as a deeply peculiar clinical setting with
significant implications. This result was compatible with
another recent study that reported possible prognostic
and predictive significance of KRAS alteration together
with MYC mutation [10], which was not included in this
panel (Supplementary Table 1). This marker may help the
clinical stratification of NAC in patients with BC. The
predominance of frameshift mutations of TP53 in patients
with pCR is compatible with a recent mutational analysis
of patients with NAC (Figure 3A) [11].
The other significant finding of this study was the
presence of MET gene alterations in patients with pCR
(Table 3C, 3D; Figure 3C). Table 3C and D showed that
MET gene alterations were driven mainly in patients with
pCR. No patients with EF had MET gene alterations (MAF
> 0.1). In fact, this alteration was found while searching
for polymorphisms that contribute to responsiveness
to chemotherapy. This alteration contributes to the loss
of c-MET affinity to its ligand, HGF, which has been
identified as a phantom ligand of MET [12-14]. Lung
cancer cells expressing this mutation have been reported
to be less sensitive to c-MET inhibition by SU11274.
This mutation has been further characterized as a
polymorphism because of its increased frequency within
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CONCLUSION
KRAS gene mutation and c-MET gene
polymorphism were associated with EF and pCR in this
analysis. Our results support the contention that targeted
sequencing using a cancer panel may function to identify
actionable targets that are associated with responsiveness
or refractoriness to NAC among patients with LABC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Seventy-six patients among 397 with LABC (cT24N0-3) for whom a preoperative FFPE tumor block
was available for NGS were included in this analysis,
excluding 22 patients whose fresh-frozen paraffinembedded (FFPE) blocks were not qualified for AmpliSeq.
pCR was defined as the absence of residual tumor both in
breast and axillary lymph nodes. The presence of ductal
carcinoma in situ was included in pCR. EF was defined
as the development of an inoperable state caused by
locoregional and/or systemic progression during NAC,
or relapse after curative surgery within 1 year after the
initiation of NAC. Patients who developed recurrence after
1 year from the start of NAC or exhibited no failure during
the follow-up period were defined as controls in this study.
Thus, our cohort was composed of three groups: pCR, EF,
and control. The clinicopathological characteristics and
disease courses of the patients whose disease progressed
within 1 year of receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were
analyzed, for comparison with the other patients. A total
of 76 patients with LABC who received NAC and had
an available preoperative tumor tissue were included in
this analysis. The institutional review board of Samsung
Medical Center, Seoul, Korea approved our study protocol
(SMC 2013-12-155).

Immunohistochemical staining

guided by hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. Then,
total RNA was extracted using the High Pure RNA
Paraffin kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
RNA yield and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Rockland, DE, USA). One sample with less than 50 ng/uL
of total RNA , even after concentration using a SpeedVac
concentrator (Thermo Scientific™, Waltham, MA, USA)
was excluded from downstream analysis, because 200 ng
of input RNA in a volume of 5 uL volume needed to be
hybridized with 20 uL of probe set master mix.

Two experienced pathologists reviewed all
pathology specimens to determine the following tumor
characteristics: histological and nuclear grades, primary
tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion,
multiplicity, and IHC staining for ER, PgR, and HER2.
ER and PgR positivity were defined using Allred scores
ranging from 3 to 8 based on IHC using antibodies
to the ER (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and PgR
(Novocastra Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne,
UK). HER2 status was evaluated using a specific antibody
(Dako, Glostrop, Denmark) and/or fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). Grades 0 and 1 for HER2, as
assessed by IHC, were defined as a negative result, and
grade 3 was defined as a positive result. Amplification
of HER2 was confirmed by FISH if HER2 was rated as
2+ by IHC. Ki67 IHC analyses were evaluated by both
independent semiquantitative and quantitative methods
(Dako). “Triple negativity” was defined as a lack of
expression of ER, PgR, and HER2. Our pathologists also
reviewed all core biopsies from referring institutions,
including IHC performed at the time of the initial referral,
and findings for all surgical specimens, without knowledge
of the NanoString results or the treatment outcome. The
institutional review board of the Samsung Medical Center,
Seoul, Korea approved our study protocol for informed
consent waiver and the use of archival tissues with
retrospective clinical data.

NanoString® nCounter Assay using 250 genes
probe including PAM50 genes
Gene expression was measured on the NanoString
nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies,
Seattle, WA, USA). The system measures the relative
abundance of each mRNA transcript of interest using a
multiplexed hybridization assay and digital readouts
of fluorescent bar-coded probes that are hybridized to
each transcript [18]. An nCounter CodeSet (NanoString
Technologies) containing a biotinylated capture probe
for 252 target genes, including 50 PAM50 genes and
five housekeeping genes (Supplementary Table 2) and
reporter probes attached to color-barcode tags-according
to the nCounter™ code-set design-was hybridized
in solution to 200 ng of total RNA for 18 h at 65 °C,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridized
samples were loaded onto the nCounter Prep Station for
posthybridization processing. On the deck of the Prep
Station, hybridized samples were purified and immobilized
in a sample cartridge for data collection, followed by
quantification of the target mRNA in each sample using
the nCounter Digital Analyzer. Quantified expression
data were analyzed using NanoString’s nSolver Analysis
Software. After performing image quality control using a
predefined cutoff value, we excluded the outlier samples
using a normalization factor based on the sum of positive
control counts greater than threefold. The counts of the
probes were then normalized using the geometric mean
of the five housekeeping genes and log2-transformed for
further analysis. In total, 62 patients with LABC and 252
genes were used in the statistical analyses.

DNA extraction
Tissue sample with tumor cell percentage with
more than 75% (from 4 mm unstained sections) were
dissected under a microscope by comparison with an
H&E-stained slide, and genomic DNA was extracted
from 76 patients with LABC using a Qiagen DNA FFPE
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After extraction, we measured
DNA concentration as well as 260/280 and 260/230 nm
ratios using a spectrophotometer (ND1000; NanoDrop
Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Each sample was then quantified using a Qubit
fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Genomic DNA with a quantity > 10 ng, as measured on the
Qubit fluorometer, was subjected to library preparation.

Technologies) and 10 ng of DNA sample per pool. The
amplicons were then ligated to Ion Xpress Barcode
Adapters and purified. Next, multiplexed bar-coded
libraries were enriched by clonal amplification using
emulsion PCR on Ion Sphere particles (Ion PGM Template
OT2 200 Kit, Life Technologies) and loaded onto an Ion
316 Chip. Massively parallel sequencing was carried out
on the Ion PGM using the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 Kit
v2. The Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (www.
lifetechnologies.com) covered hot-spot regions of 50
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
The primary filtering process was carried out using
the Torrent Suite v3.6.0 and the Ion Torrent Variant Caller
v3.6 software. The pipeline includes signaling processing,
base calling, quality score assignment, adapter trimming,
read alignment to human genome 19 references, mapping
QC, coverage analysis, and variant calling. For variant
detection, a minimum coverage of 100 reads must be
achieved, and at least 5% of mutant reads were selected
for variants. Variant calls were further analyzed using
the ANNOVAR, which included variant filtering and
annotation using the COSMIC database, dbSNP build 137,
and amino acid change information.

v2.0 (NanoString Technologies) [19]. Data were log2transformed and used for further analysis. To compare
normalized expression values between groups classified
according to clinical outcomes, a t test was used. P-values
were adjusted using the FDR correction for multiple
comparisons [20]. FDRs less than 0.1 were considered as
significantly different.
Intrinsic subtypes classification was performed
by using the PAM50 predictor, as described in Parker et
al. [21]. To obtain more consistent results, we merged
microarray expression data of TCGA breast cancers with
our NanoString data after adjusting for batch effects using
ComBat algorithm [22], and applied nearest PAM50
centroid algorithm Bioclassifier to predict PAM50
subtypes [21]. All statistical tests, plots and PAM50
subtype prediction were conducted using R version 3.0.2
(http://www.R-project.org/).

the medical records, we included ‘Patient Cohort’ analysis
to fulfill these criteria (Figure 1).

Bioinformatic and statistical analysis for ampliseq
and nCounter assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Variant calls from Ion AmpliSeq were further
evaluated to reduce potential false-positives. We
considered coverage ( > 100) and quality score ( > 30)
as filtering criteria. In addition, a minimum threshold
of mutant allele fraction (MAF) was taken into account
for convincing variants as real: > 1% for mutations with
a low allele fraction and > 10% for polymorphisms. For
the statistical analysis of final variants, read alignments
were manually investigated using the Integrative
Genomic Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/).
We also discarded the Korean-specific germ-line variants
rs1042522 in TP53 and rs1870377 in KDR. Among the
variants that satisfied the filtering criteria described above,
variants causing amino acid changes and frameshifts were
finally chosen for statistical analysis. Fisher’s exact test
was used for the analysis of mutations and polymorphic
variants separately, to discover variants that were enriched
in the patients with a favorable outcome. P-values < 0.05
were considered significantly different.
For gene expression data from the NanoString
nCounter assay, filtering of samples using quality
control (QC) criteria was performed according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Raw counts of QCpassed samples were normalized using five reference
genes as internal controls (GUSB, PUM1, TBP, TFRC,
and TUBB). The QC and normalization mentioned above
were performed using the nSolver Analysis Software
