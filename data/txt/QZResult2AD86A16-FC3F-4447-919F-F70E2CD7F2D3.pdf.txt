Abstract
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains refractory to
therapies. The nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) transcription factor
is involved in cell growth, cell motility, and vascularization.
We evaluated whether targeting NF-KB could be of therapeutic
and prognostic values in human RCC. The activation of the
NF-KB pathway in human RCC cells and tumors was
investigated by Western blot. In vitro, the effects of BAY 117085 and sulfasalazine, two NF-KB inhibitors, on tumor cell
growth were investigated by cell counting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Their specificity toward NF-KB was analyzed by Western blot, confocal
microscopy, NF-KB small interfering RNA, and NF-KB transcription assay. In vivo, the effects of BAY 11-7085 on the
growth of human RCC tumors were investigated in nude mice.
A tissue microarray (TMA) containing 241 cases of human RCC
with 12 to 22 years of clinical follow-up and corresponding
normal tissues was built up to assess prognostic significance
of activated NF-KB. NF-KB is constitutively activated in
cultured cells expressing or not the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
tumor suppressor gene as a consequence of Akt kinase
activation and in tumors. In vitro and in vivo NF-KB inhibition
blocked tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis. On the
TMA, NF-KB activation was correlated with tumor dimension
but was not found to be an independent prognostic factor for
patient survival. This report provides strong evidence that the
mechanisms responsible for the intrinsic resistance of RCC
cells to apoptosis converge on NF-KB independently of VHL
expression and that targeting this pathway has great
anticancer potential. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11668–76]

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 3% of adult malignancy
and >90% of adult renal neoplasms. RCC is among the first 10
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (1). Metastatic
RCC is resistant to radiotherapy and to systemic therapy (2).

However, it should be stressed that recent advances in understanding the biology of human RCC have led to novel targeted
therapeutic approaches with higher response rates, especially
inhibitors of tyrosine kinase receptors such as sunitinib or
sorafenib that have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer
(3, 4). Unfortunately, the clinical response to these agents is limited
in time due to the development of tumor resistance by still
unknown mechanisms. New therapeutic options, including combination regimens, have still to be uncovered.
Biallelic inactivating mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
tumor suppressor gene occur in patients with the VHL syndrome
and in most patients with sporadic RCC (5, 6). The VHL gene
products are involved in the degradation of hypoxia-induced
transcription factors (HIFs), leading to the down-regulation of
several angiogenic and growth factors, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-h, which
contribute to RCC tumorigenesis (7).
The nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) transcriptional pathway is
involved in many fundamental biological processes, including
immunity, inflammation, angiogenesis, cell migration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (8). In resting conditions, NF-nB is maintained
in an inactive state in the cytoplasm through binding to the
endogenous inhibitor InBa. On stimulation by G protein–coupled
receptors or tyrosine kinase receptor ligands, the InB kinase (IKK)
tripartite complex may be activated, leading to InBa phosphorylation and degradation by a proteasome-mediated process. This
releases NF-nB from the negative regulation of InB, exposing its
nuclear localization signal and allowing it to translocate to the
nucleus where it exerts its transcriptional activity (8). The
activation of the IKK complex may be achieved through different
ways, including phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) or Akt (8). The classic pathway is responsible for
inhibition of programmed cell death in most conditions (8, 9).
RCC is characterized by a high resistance to tumor cell apoptosis
both intrinsic and induced by radiation or systemic therapies,
including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The mechanisms of
this resistance are not elucidated. Recent data in other tumors,
including tumors from the pancreas, bladder, ovary, breast, or lung,
suggest that survival signaling pathways, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt or MAPK-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 pathways, are involved in the resistance of these tumors
to current chemotherapies using apoptotic compounds (10–12).
The results obtained by various investigators have ruled out the
involvement of multidrug resistance gene in human RCC resistance
(2, 13). We have recently shown the critical role played by the PI3K/
Akt pathway in human RCC growth (14). In this study, this pathway
was found to be constitutively activated and found to promote

inhibition of tumor cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.
However, the downstream target(s) of Akt responsible for its
survival effect was not investigated. In their recent study, Oka et al.
(15) have shown that inhibition of NF-nB phosphorylation/
activation with parthenolide slows down RCC tumor (OUR-10
cells) growth in nude mice through induction of tumor cell
apoptosis. This study is interesting because the activity of NF-nB is
regulated by Akt.
The present study was conducted to characterize the intracellular pathways involved in human RCC tumorigenesis and to
identify molecular targets that might be used to design efficient,
targeted, and safe therapies for this refractory disease. We found
that the NK-nB signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in
promoting growth and that the intrinsic resistance of RCC to cell
apoptosis converges on NF-nB independently on the VHL status.
Targeting NF-nB or one of its downstream target genes specific for
RCC may thus constitute potential targets for therapeutic
intervention.

Materials and Methods
Cells and Cell Culture
Human clear RCC cell lines either deficient in VHL (786-0, UOK-126,
UOK-128, and A498) or expressing VHL (ACHN, Caki-1, and Caki-2) were
maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and used at 80% confluence, unless otherwise specified. These cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, except
UOK-126 and UOK-128 that were generously given by Dr. P. Anglard
(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U575, Centre de
Neurochimie, Strasbourg, France; ref. 16).

grown for 48 h, and then treated for 48 h with various concentrations of the
NF-nB inhibitors BAY 11-7085 [(E)3-[(4-t-butylphenyl)sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile; 0–30 Amol/L; VWR International] or sulfasalazine (0.1–10 mmol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich).

Cell Viability Measurements
RCC cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma-Aldrich) in cells treated
as above (14, 21).

Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase–Mediated dUTP
Nick End Labeling Staining
RCC cells were seeded in four-well Tissue-Tek chamber slides (20,000/mL),
grown for 48 h, and then treated with either NF-nB inhibitor or DMSO alone
(control) for 24 or 48 h. RCC cell death was assayed as described (14) by the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) method. Total and stained cells in 10 fields (0.25 mm2 each) were
counted and cell death was expressed as a percentage of stained cells to total
cells.

Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting Analysis
RCC cells were seeded in 25 cm2 plates (20,000/mL) and treated as above.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed exactly
as described (14) using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, except for
sulfasalazine experiments that were performed using Annexin V alone
because sulfasalazine has the same color than propidium iodide in solution.
To ensure that cell death was due to cell apoptosis, we also performed DNA
fragmentation assay in cells treated with sulfasalazine. In some experiments, the cell-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(Ome)-fluoromethylketone (B-D-FMK; Enzyme Systems Products) was used. In this case,
RCC cells were treated for 48 h with 20 Amol/L BAY 11-7085 or 0.2 mmol/L
sulfasalazine in the presence or absence of 40 Amol/L B-D-FMK.

DNA Fragmentation Assay

Human Tumor Biopsies

Experiment was performed as described previously (19).

The tumor and normal corresponding tissues of three patients with
sporadic RCC were obtained from the Department of Urology, University
Hospital of Strasbourg (Strasbourg, France). Informed consent was obtained
from all patients. The tumors were staged pT3bN0M0 according to tumornode-metastasis (TNM) classification (17, 18). Immediately after surgical
resection, tissues were fresh frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen until protein
expression analysis.

Small Interfering RNA Transfection
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes specific for human NF-nB p65
subunit and control nonsilencing siRNA were obtained from Ozyme (Cell
Signaling local distributor). Transient transfection of RCC cells in 25 cm2
plates (20,000/mL) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Western Blot Analysis
Tumor tissue or whole-cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (14, 19).
Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowry
et al. (20). The membranes were incubated for 24 h at 4jC with 1:250
dilution of the following primary antibodies (Ozyme): polyclonal rabbit antiNF-nB p65 antibody, polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-NF-nB p65 (S536)
antibody, polyclonal rabbit anti-InBa antibody, and monoclonal mouse antiphospho-InBa (S32/36; 5A5) antibody. For visualization of protein gel
loading, a monoclonal mouse anti-h-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was
used at 1:5,000 dilution. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody was used (14, 19). Immunoreactivity was visualized
with the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit
(Amersham). Phospho-NF-nB to total NF-nB ratios and phospho-InB to
total InB ratios were calculated using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 analysis
software.

Cell Proliferation Measurements
RCC cell proliferation was assessed by counting adherent cells as
described (14, 19). RCC cells were seeded in 24-well plates (20,000/mL),

www.aacrjournals.org

Confocal Microscopy
RCC cells were plated in four-well chamber slides (20,000/mL) for
48 h and then treated with either NF-nB inhibitor or DMSO alone (control)
for 8 h. Tumor cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde at 4% for 20 min at
4jC and then permeabilized with Triton X-100 at 0.5% for 5 min. Slides were
saturated in bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 3% for 30 min and incubated
with monoclonal mouse anti-NF-nB p65 (Tebu-Bio, Santa Cruz Biotechnology local distributor) and polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-NF-nB p65 (S276;
Abcam) primary antibodies diluted at 1:50 and 1:25, respectively, in 1.5%
BSA at 4jC overnight in a wet atmosphere. Slides were then washed thrice
for 10 min in PBS and incubated with polyclonal mouse and rabbit
secondary antibodies coupled, respectively, to A555 and A488 (Invitrogen)
diluted at 1:500 in 1.5% BSA at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Slides
were washed twice for 10 min in 1 PBS and once for 10 min in bidistilled
water and mounted with Aquamount and analyzed by confocal microscopy
(Zeiss LSM 510 inverted microscope).

NF-KB Transcriptional Activity Measurement
It was assayed using the nonradioactive NF-nB p50/p65 transcription
factor assay (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

RCC Tumor Model
Tumor implantation and growth. All animal studies were in
compliance with the French animal use regulations. Xenografts with 10
millions of 786-0 or Caki-1 cells were performed on twenty 7-week-old male
Swiss nu/nu nude mice each (Iffa-Credo; ref. 14). One group was treated
with BAY 11-7085 (one injection daily of 5 mg/kg, i.p.) dissolved in DMSO/
PBS (diluent, 1:1, v/v). The other group was treated with the diluent alone
(control). The average volume of the tumors was 155.56 F 38.34 mm3
(control) and 160.36 F 36.05 mm3 (BAY 11-7085; not significant) for 786-0
tumors and 117.03 F 36.76 mm3 (control) and 125.42 F 47.11 mm3 (BAY 117085; not significant) for Caki-1 tumors. The tumor volumes and animal
weight were measured twice weekly during the treatment period.

Cancer Research
The tumors were harvested, paraffin embedded, and cut in 4-Am-thick
sections for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis (19). A tissue
microarray (TMA) was built up by taking a 1-mm cylindrical sample from
each tumor. To assess the possible relationship between Akt (14) and NF-nB
activations, we built up a TMA including samples from tumors grown in
mice treated with the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 (14). Staining with
polyclonal rabbit anti-NF-nB p65 and anti-phospho-NF-nB p65 (S536)
antibodies at 1:250 dilution was performed.
Immunohistochemistry. TMA sections were processed as described
(14) using the following primary polyclonal rabbit antibodies obtained from
Ozyme: polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho Akt (S473) and anti-phospho NF-nB
p65 (S276) at 1:50 dilution and polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-glycogen
synthase kinase (GSK)-3h (S9) at 1:25 dilution. Endometrial and prostatic
adenocarcinoma samples were incorporated in the TMA and used as
positive tissue controls in all TMAs used. Negative control reaction was
performed by omitting the primary antibody.
The scoring was based on cytoplasmic staining, nuclear staining, or both
for phospho-GSK-3h, phospho-NF-nB, and phospho-Akt expression, respectively. Staining intensity was graded as weak, moderate, intense, or negative
(1+, 2+, 3+, or 0) and plotted as shown in the corresponding figures.
Proliferative and apoptotic index. Both indexes were determined as
described (14) using a mouse monoclonal anti-human Ki67 antibody (Mib-1;
Dako) and the TUNEL method (Roche Diagnostics), respectively. Stainings
were quantified in a blinded fashion by an experienced urologic
histopathologist (V.L.).
Neovascularization. Tumor sections were stained for endothelial cells
with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human factor VIII antibody (Dako) using a
standard immunohistochemical method described previously (19). Quantifications of both vessel intersecting points and the total number of vessels
were performed as described previously (14, 19, 22).

Correlation coefficient was computed using Spearman test. To assess
whether activated NF-nB expression is associated with poor patient
prognosis, we used Kaplan-Meier (with log-rank test) method. Multivariate
prognosis analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard model.
Tumor stage and grade were used as variables in this analysis.
Computations were done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
13.0. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

TMA of Human RCC
Patients and clinical data. From January 1980 to December 1990, 255
RCC patients were subjected to radical nephrectomy in the Department of
Urology of the University Hospital of Strasbourg. The tumors were staged
according to TNM classification (17, 18) and ranged from pT1a to
pT3bN0M0. The characteristics of the population are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. Four patients were lost during follow-up. Death
occurred in 141 cases.
In a multicentric and retrospective study, these tumors were graded
according to the Fuhrman’s classification by three independent urologic
histopathologists (23).
TMA and immunohistochemistry. RCC tumor biopsies were fixed in
buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. For each patient, normal kidney
tissue was available in the renal biopsies. After selection of morphologically
representative regions of individual paraffin-embedded renal tumors, core
biopsies of 1-mm-diameter tumor and corresponding normal tissue were
taken and transferred to a recipient paraffin block using a custom-built
microarrayer. Sections (4 Am thick) were prepared and used for subsequent
immunohistochemical analysis.
Sections were processed as described above and using a polyclonal rabbit
anti-phospho-NF-nB (S276; Ozyme) at 1:50 dilution in PBS-Tween 20 buffer
overnight at 4jC. Standard indirect immunoperoxidase procedures were
used for visualization.
The scoring was based on nuclear staining and scored as described
above. The distribution was graded in percentage (%) of stained cells among
the total number of cells.

Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as mean F SEM. Values were compared using
multifactorial ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keul’s test for
multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
For analysis of the patient TMA, overall survival was defined as the time
between nephrectomy and patient death or censoring. Nonparametric
Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to assess significativity of activated NF-nB staining with patient characteristics (i.e., sex,
Fuhrman grade, microvascular invasion, tumor dimension, and TNM stage).

phospho-Akt (S473; P-Akt ), phospho-GSK-3 (S9; P-GSK-3 ), or phospho-NF-nB
(S276; P-NF-jB ) and the staining results were quantified as detailed in Materials

nonphosphorylated state at a similar level in tumors as well as
in normal corresponding tissues (Fig. 2A). In contrast, high levels
of phosphoproteins are found in tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues (Fig. 2A), indicating that NF-nB is constitutively activated in human RCC tumors. The ratios of phosphoNF-nB to total NF-nB were 0.25, 0.14, 0.05, 0.43, 0.9, and 0.23 for N1,
N2, N3, T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The ratios of phospho-InB to
total InB were 0.76, 0.75, 0.75, 0.85, 0.92, and 1.09 for N1, N2, N3, T1,
T2, and T3, respectively.

Results
NF-KB expression in human RCC tumors treated with the
PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. We have previously shown that the
PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively activated in human RCC both
in vitro and in vivo (14) and NF-nB is activated through Aktdependent IKK phosphorylation. In this previous studies, we
identified GSK-3h as being regulated by Akt. Using the TMA,
phospho-Akt (S473) was substantially decreased by >30% (Fig. 1A).
We confirmed the Akt-dependent GSK-3 phosphorylation and
inactivation (Fig. 1B). Now, we extend this finding by showing that
the NF-nB transcription factor is also a downstream target of Akt
in human RCC (Fig. 1C). Representative immunostainings are
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A to C, respectively.
NF-KB and IKB expression in human RCC tumor biopsies.
The activation state of NF-nB and InB was thus investigated in
human RCC tumors compared with corresponding normal kidney
tissues. For that, we analyzed both NF-nB p65 subunit and InB
expression as well as their phosphorylation status in tumor and
normal tissue protein samples. Both proteins are expressed in the

of both NF-nB p65 subunit and InB in their nonphosphorylated or
phosphorylated states and the possible relationship with the VHL
status. No differences in phosphorylation states or in the levels of
expression of both proteins were observed, indicating a constitutive activation of NF-nB regardless of the VHL status (Fig. 2B). The
ratios of phospho-NF-nB to total NF-nB were 0.65, 0.63, 0.74, 1.01,
1.01, 1.01, and 0.86 for 786-0, UOK-126, UOK-128, A498, ACHN, Caki1, and Caki-2 cells, respectively. The ratios of phospho-InB to total
InB were 0.7, 0.37, 0.38, 1.0, 0.44, 0.79, and 1.1 for 786-0, UOK-126,
UOK-128, A498, ACHN, Caki-1, and Caki-2 cells, respectively.
Effect of NF-KB inhibitors on cultured RCC cell growth and
death. We used two NF-nB inhibitors, BAY 11-7085 and
sulfasalazine, to investigate the involvement of NF-nB activation
on RCC growth. Both inhibitors act by maintaining InB bound to
NF-nB, thus inhibiting the activation and nuclear translocation of
NF-nB (24, 25). We used 786-0 and Caki-1 cells, respectively
deficient in normal VHL tumor suppressor gene products or
expressing them, in further experiments. BAY 11-7085 decreased
cell density by up to 100% in a concentration-dependent manner.
No difference in the effectiveness of the inhibitors was noted with
the VHL status of the cells (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S3A).
Testing cell viability by MTT (Supplementary Figs. S2B and S3B)
and cell death by TUNEL staining (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S4A)
and FACS analysis (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S4B) in response to
either inhibitor in both cell lines strongly suggests that the effects
of the inhibitor are achieved through induction of cell apoptosis
independently of VHL expression. In addition, DNA laddering
characteristic of cell apoptosis was observed in response to the
inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S4C). To further ensure that the

effects of both NF-nB inhibitors are achieved through induction of
cell apoptosis, the effects of either NF-nB inhibitor were also
measured by FACS in the presence of B-D-FMK (26), which reduced
significantly the apoptotic effects of both NF-nB inhibitors (Fig. 3B;
Supplementary Fig. S4B). The NF-nB pathway thus seems to be
turned toward cell survival in human RCC.
Specificity toward NF-KB of the effects of the inhibitors. To
ascertain that the apoptotic effects of BAY 11-7085 and sulfasalazine were obtained through inhibition of the NF-nB pathway, we
followed three experimental procedures.
The effect of both inhibitors on NF-nB p65 phosphorylation was
then studied in 786-0 and Caki-1 cells by treating them for 0 min,
30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 8 h, 24 h, and 48 h with a maximally effective
concentration of either inhibitor (i.e., BAY 11-7085 at 20 Amol/L
and sulfasalazine at 0.2 mmol/L). Whereas unphosphorylated
proteins remained unchanged during this time course, phosphoNF-nB p65 (S256) was rapidly undetectable (30 min in cells treated
with BAY 11-7085 and 1 to 2 h in cells treated with sulfasalazine)
and returned to basal value only after 24 to 48 h of treatment
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S5).
The effect of a maximally effective concentration of either
inhibitor on phospho-NF-nB p65 (S276) expression and subcellular
localization was also assessed by confocal microscopy. In 786-0
cells treated in control, phospho-NF-nB p65 was observed in the
nucleus of virtually all cells (Fig. 4B), argumenting in favor of the
constitutive activation of NF-nB in human RCC. After treatment
with BAY 11-7085, phospho-NF-nB p65 was no longer detected.
Similar results were obtained in Caki-1 cells and in cells treated
with sulfasalazine (data not shown).

NF-kB Signaling Pathway in Renal Cell Carcinoma

Finally, NF-nB p65 was specifically knock down in RCC cells
using specific siRNA. Apoptosis was then assessed by FACS analysis
in the presence or absence of a maximally effective concentrations
of either inhibitor, as above. In 786-0 cells transfected with p65specific siRNA, p65 expression was significantly reduced, whereas
no difference was noted between untransfected cells and cells
transfected with transfection reagent. In 786-0 cells treated with
BAY 11-7085, we obtained similar results as the ones shown in
Figs. 3B and 4C. The transfection with p65-specific siRNA at the
concentration used (100 nmol/well) alone induced apoptosis by
f20%, further argumenting the critical role of NF-nB in tumor cell
survival (Fig. 4C). The efficiency of BAY 11-7085 to induce tumor
cell apoptosis was substantially decreased in cells transfected with
p65-specific siRNA by 30% (Fig. 4C). Because similar results were
obtained with sulfasalazine in 786-0 cells and in Caki-1 cells with
both inhibitors.
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the apoptotic
effects of NF-nB inhibitors were attributable to NF-nB inhibition.
Transcriptional activity of NF-KB. NF-nB activity was
evaluated using a NF-nB p50/p65 transcription factor kit as
detailed in Materials and Methods in resting cells and in cells
treated with either inhibitor at a maximally effective concentration.
Because the effects of both inhibitors on NF-nB phosphorylation
were maximal after 30 min of exposure and sustained for at least 8 h
(Fig. 4D), we choose to measure NF-nB activity in cells treated for
2 h with either inhibitor. NF-nB is constitutively activated in
human RCC, and this activity is inhibited by 40% to 50% by BAY 117085 and sip65 in both cell lines (Fig. 4D). Similar results were
obtained with sulfasalazine (data not shown). No significant
difference was observed in 786-0 versus Caki-1 cells. Thus, tumor
cell apoptosis mediated by NF-nB inhibitors is achieved through
inhibition of NF-nB transcriptional activity.
Effects of NF-KB inhibition on RCC tumor growth in vivo.
The treatment of xenograft athymic mice with BAY 11-7085
(5 mg/kg) inhibited significantly tumor growth by f80% (Fig. 5).
This concentration of the NF-nB inhibitor was chosen from
previous studies by other investigators in nude mice (27, 28). No
difference was observed in the overall efficiency of the NF-nB
inhibitor with the VHL status of the implanted tumors. In some
mice, partial regression was observed following the treatment.
All the mice maintained body weight, and no difference was
observed between mice treated in control or with BAY 11-7085
(Supplementary Table S2). The treatment seems to be well
tolerated; indeed, plasma concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine,
albumin, and urea showed no difference between mice bearing
786-0 or Caki-1 tumors treated in control or with BAY 11-7085
(Supplementary Table S2).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors revealed that BAY 117085 exerts its antitumoral effect through induction of tumor cell
apoptosis (786-0 tumors: 1.4 F 0.2% versus 2.4 F 0.3% of TUNELstained cells in tumors of control-treated and BAY 11-7085–treated
mice, respectively; n = 8; P < 0.05; Caki-1 tumors: 1.2 F 0.3% versus
2.5 F 0.3% of TUNEL-stained cells in tumors of control-treated and
BAY 11-7085–treated mice, respectively; n = 7; P < 0.05; Fig. 6A),
confirming the in vitro data. No effects were observed on tumor cell
proliferation (Fig. 6B) and neovascularization (data not shown) in
either tumor.
To assess the efficiency of the treatment on NF-nB activation, a
TMA was built up with the tumors harvested from the mice to avoid
difference in staining due to the manipulation of many slides.
Immunostaining clearly showed a substantial diminution of

activated NF-nB in tumors harvested from mice treated by the
NF-nB inhibitor compared with tumors harvested from mice
treated in control regardless of the VHL status of the tumors
(Fig. 6C). This finding confirms appropriate drug targeting in vivo
and also the constitutive activation of NF-nB in RCC tumors.
These results strongly suggest that NF-nB and its downstream
targets participate in the overall intrinsic resistance of human RCC
to tumor cell death and that the treatment by specific inhibitor
seems to be safe.

tissues (data not shown). Analysis of tumor tissues showed that, as
already known, sex, age, tumor dimension, and Fuhrman grade are
independent prognostic factor for patient survival. Variables that
were tested about activated NF-nB are sex, RCC subtype, Fuhrman
grade, microvascular invasion, tumor dimension, TNM stage, and
death. Among these variables, significativity was obtained for clear
RCC having higher expression of activated NF-nB compared with
the other types taken together (P = 0.002) and for tumor dimension
(P = 0.02). About the significativity with RCC types, expression
values were 28.3 F 2.4 (median 5%) for clear RCC and 6.8 F 2.7
(median 0%) for the other RCC types. About tumor dimension, the
Spearman nonparametric correlation coefficient was 0.153.
Activated NF-nB did not appear as an independent prognostic
factor for patient survival (Supplementary Fig. S6C).

Discussion
The NF-nB signal transduction pathway is misregulated in a
variety of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies due either to
genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, amplifications, and mutations, or to chronic activation of the pathway.
Constitutive activation of the NF-nB pathway can contribute to the
oncogenic state in several ways (e.g., by driving proliferation,
enhancing cell survival, and/or promoting angiogenesis or
metastasis).
At the nonphosphorylated state, NF-nB and InBa were found at
similar levels in tumors compared with normal corresponding
tissues, suggesting that DNA duplication or amplification events
are not present in human RCC, although such assumption will need
to be confirmed by specific genetic studies. However, phosphor-

ylation of both NF-nB and InBa was only observed in tumors and
not in corresponding normal tissues, as well as in cultured tumor
cells, suggesting that this pathway is constitutively activated in
human RCC. Our results also strongly suggest that the constitutive
activation of NF-nB is most essentially the result of the constitutive
activation of Akt in human RCC. Thus, besides GSK-3, Akt also
regulates NF-nB activity in this tumor type.
To date, and in contrast to other tumor types, the possible
involvement of NF-nB in human RCC tumorigenesis has only
received little attention, and no NF-nB–regulated genes or set of
genes that might be involved in this disease have been described. In
addition, in vivo data are missing and the few data available on
cultured cells are in most cases difficult to interpret or
contradictory (29–33). The VHL gene products have been shown
to suppress NF-nB activity in human RCC. However, the role VHL
may play in tumor cell survival remains unknown at present in
human RCC (32–34). Evidence has been presented that certain
tumor suppressors can block NF-nB activation, such as Arf, CYLD,
and, in some conditions, p53 (35–37). Our results did not reveal any
difference in the efficiency and mechanism of action of the NF-nB
inhibitors depending on the VHL status of the cells. The absence of
VHL dependency was already observed in our previous studies
dealing with the involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway in RCC
growth. Thus, VHL gene products do not seem to control the NFnB signaling pathway in human RCC, although HIF is regulated by
NF-nB (38). Consistent with our findings, Oka et al. (15) have
recently shown that inhibition of NF-nB phosphorylation by
sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide slows down OUR-10 RCC
tumor growth in nude mice through induction of tumor cell
apoptosis. However, the VHL status of OUR-10 cells has not been

reported. Thus, additional experiments focusing on that particular
point are needed to more precisely define the role, if any, of the
VHL tumor suppressor gene in the sensitivity of human RCC to NFnB inhibition.
Cancer-relevant NF-nB–dependent genes include those encoding
cytokines and chemokines (such as TNF-a, IL1, IL8, and MCP-1),
proliferative regulators (such as cyclin D1), antiapoptotic proteins
(such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and IAP), and modulators of invasion and
angiogenesis (such as MMP and VEGF; refs. 39, 40). Besides VEGF,
which is mainly controlled by the VHL/HIF system in human RCC,
there are no consistent data allowing to know whether some of
these downstream targets are involved in this disease. Part of our
ongoing work using target gene array and two-dimensional
difference gel electrophoresis aims at identifying genes controlled
by NF-nB in human RCC.
An exciting feature of NF-nB is the demonstration in various
reports that this transcription factor is activated in response to
chemotherapies and to radiation and that it functions to suppress
the apoptotic potential of that cancer therapy in various tumor
types (41–43). Some clinical trials using certain chemotherapies in
conjunction with NF-nB inhibitors, such as thalidomide, are
presently under way to assess whether NF-nB blockade promotes
cancer therapy efficacy. Because chemotherapeutic agents, such as
daunorubicin or vinblastine, have been shown to activate the NFnB signaling pathway in human RCC cells in culture, the possibility
exists that such association may have therapeutic potential in
human RCC as well. Part of our ongoing work explores this
possibility in human RCC.
Oya et al. (44) have shown that, out of 45 cases of human RCC
they investigated, 15 cases showed an increase of >200% in NF-nB
activity compared with corresponding normal renal tissue. Such
increase was more often observed in locally advanced cases than in
localized cases. They concluded that an increase in NF-nB activity

may be related to tumor development. However, the relation, if any,
of the increase in NF-nB activity with patient survival was not
investigated. In the present study, we used a TMA composed of 241
cases of human RCC that have been harvested between 1980 and
1990. NF-nB activation was found to be higher in clear RCC versus
other subtypes and to be related to tumor dimension but did not
seem to be an independent prognostic factor for patient survival.
We did not find significant differences in NF-nB activation between
localized and locally advanced cases. The reason for this apparent
discrepancy between the study of Oya et al. (44) and the present
study is not known but may be related to the number of cases that
were analyzed.
This report provides strong evidence that the mechanisms
responsible for the intrinsic resistance of RCC to cell apoptosis
converge on NF-nB independently on the VHL status and that
NF-nB or its downstream targets have potential therapeutic value
in this refractory disease. The identification of these downstream
targets is currently on the way in our laboratory.
