ABSTRACT:
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) is a key regulator of
metabolism, proliferation, inflammation and differentiation, and upregulates
tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, BRCA1 and PPARγ itself. Examination of
mammary carcinogenesis in transgenic mice expressing the dominant-negative
Pax8PPARγ fusion protein revealed that tumors were estrogen receptorα (ER)positive and sensitive to the ER antagonist, fulvestrant. Here we evaluated whether
administration of an irreversible PPARγ inhibitor in vivo could similarly induce
ER expression in otherwise ER-negative mammary tumors following induction
of carcinogenesis, and sensitize them to the antitumor effects of fulvestrant. In
addition, we wished to determine whether the effect of GW9662 was associated
with a PPAR-selective gene expression profile. Mammary carcinogenesis was
induced in wild-type FVB mice by treatment with medroxyprogesterone and
dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) that were subsequently maintained on a diet
supplemented with 0.1% GW9662, and tumorigenesis and gene expression profiling
of the resulting tumors were determined. Administration of GW9962 resulted in
ER+ tumors that were highly sensitive to fulvestrant. Tumors from GW9662-treated
animals exhibited reduced expression of a metabolic gene profile indicative of
PPARγ inhibition, including PPARγ itself. Additionally, GW9662 upregulated the
expression of several genes associated with the transcription, processing, splicing
and translation of RNA. This study is the first to show that an irreversible PPARγ
inhibitor can mimic a dominant-negative PPARγ transgene to elicit the development
of ER-responsive tumors. These findings suggest that it may be possible to
pharmacologically influence the responsiveness of tumors to anti-estrogen therapy.

INTRODUCTION

heterodimeric partners with RXR, and require highaffinity binding of PPAR isotype-specific ligands to
engage transcription. Of the three subtypes, PPARγ is
the major species expressed in the mammary gland and
in primary and metastatic breast cancer and breast cancer
cell lines [5].
PPARγ and PPARδ modulate cell fate in the
mammary gland [6, 9, 10], suggesting that PPAR
agonists or antagonists may have the potential to

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR) nuclear receptor subfamily regulates a number
of metabolic processes, including fatty acid β-oxidation,
glucose utilization, cholesterol transport, energy balance
and adipocyte differentiation [1-4]. PPARs also play
important roles in modulating inflammation, proliferation,
angiogenesis and neoplasia [5-8]. PPARs function as

regulate differentiation and hence tumor progression.
PPARγ agonists are potent chemopreventive agents in
mammary carcinogenesis [11], which is consistent with
the enhancement of mammary tumorigenesis by PPARγ
heterozygosity [12]. In a large percentage of follicular
thyroid cancers, PPARγ exists as the dominant-negative

fusion protein, Pax8-PPARγ, associated with the t(2;3)
(q13;p25) translocation [13]. Pax8PPARγ potently blocks
PPARγ function [13, 14], rather than merely serving as a
low affinity receptor that can be activated at high ligand
concentrations [15]. Importantly, the irreversible PPARγ
‘suicide’ inhibitor, GW9662 [16], mimics the growth
promoting effects of Pax8PPARγ in thyroid cells [17],
suggesting that selective pharmacological manipulation
of PPARγ is feasible.
Although many studies have addressed the
interactions between different nuclear receptor subfamilies,
an area of relevance to breast cancer is the inhibitory effect
of PPARγ on ERα (ER) promoter activation through its
interaction with ER response elements [18]. Conversely,
ER may bind to PPARγ response elements (PPREs) to
inhibit PPAR-dependent transcription [19]. The ER and
PPARγ pathways produce opposite effects on PI3K/AKT
signaling, accounting in part, for the divergent responses
produced by their cognate ligands in estrogen-dependent
human breast cancer cells [19]. These findings suggest
that suppression of PPARγ may upregulate ER expression
in tumors to allow the implementation of anti-estrogen
therapy. As a proof of principle, this was demonstrated
by the effectiveness of the ER antagonist, fulvestrant,
in preventing mammary tumorigenesis in MMTVPax8PPARγ mice, in which tumors normally present
with a more aggressive progenitor cell phenotype [10].
Therefore, from a chemoprevention perspective, it would
be important to be able to mimic the MMTV-Pax8PPARγ
transgene pharmacologically by administering a PPARγ
antagonist to increase the percentage of ER+ tumors
and render them amenable to anti-estrogen therapy.
This approach would be dependent on whether a PPAR
antagonist could be developed with favorable specificity
and pharmacokinetic properties to achieve selective and
sustained inhibition of PPARγ. Examples of PPARγ
antagonists are the suicide inhibitors, GW9662 (2-chloro5-nitro-N-phenylbenzamide) [16], 2-bromo-5-nitroN-phenylbenzamide [20] and the structurally similar
T0070907 [21], as well as the partial PPARγ agonists,
GW0072 [22] and L-764406 [23]. Although, GW9662
and T0070907 have also been reported to produce offtarget effects in vitro [24-26], their in vivo selectivity
has yet to be demonstrated. In this report, we show
that GW9662 when administered continuously in the
diet beginning at the onset of mammary carcinogenesis
induces ER-responsive tumors susceptible to fulvestrant
therapy. Furthermore, GW9662 inhibited a PPARγdependent metabolic gene expression signature, including
PPARγ itself. These results are the first to demonstrate
that GW9662 is at least in part PPARγ-selective, and can
induce sensitivity to anti-estrogen therapy.

0.1% (w/w) GW9662, 250 mg/kg fulvestrant administered s.c.
every other week or the combination of the GW9662 diet and

reduction in survival vs. control mice (P=0.0382), but not vs.
fulvestrant treatment (P=0.0759); fulvestrant treatment alone
did not significantly affect survival (P=0.7223). GW9662
and fulvestrant treatment produced a significant increase in
survival vs. fulvestrant (P=0.0008) or GW9662 (P=0.0001)

RESULTS

mice [10], but not a reduction in the total number of
tumors (Figure 1B). While no significant difference in
survival was noted for fulvestrant-treated control mice, a
marked increase in survival (Figure 1A) and a reduction
in tumor number (Figure 1B) were observed in animals
maintained on GW9662 and treated with fulvestrant.
Consistent with these findings was an increase in ER
expression in tumors from GW9662-treated mice in
comparison to animals maintained on the control diet as
determined by immunohistochemical (Figure 2A) and
western analyses (Figure 2B). Increased ER, as well as PR
expression, was accompanied by an increase in Esr1 and
Pgr mRNA levels (Figure 3A). GW9662 treatment also
resulted in a reduction of PPARγ protein (Figure 2B) and
mRNA (Figure 3A). Histological evaluation of the tumors
indicated that GW9662, but not fulvestrant, produced a
significant increase in the percentage of adenocarcinomas
(P=0.0333) (Table S1).

GW9662 induces sensitivity to antiestrogen
therapy
To evaluate the chemopreventive effect of GW9662
on mammary tumor development, carcinogenesis was
induced in FVB mice by progestin and DMBA treatment.
Animals were maintained on either a control diet or a
diet supplemented with 0.1% GW9662 beginning one
day after the last dose of DMBA, and both groups were
administered either vehicle or 250 mg/kg fulvestrant
by subcutaneous injection every other week (Figure 1).
Animals maintained on GW9662 alone exhibited a modest
reduction in survival (Figure 1A) similar to what was
observed previously in MMTV-Pax8PPARγ transgenic

particular, RBM39, whose expression was increased 6.6fold by GW9662, was recently reported to be increased in
ER-dependent mammary tumors developing in caveolin-1
knockout mice [27].

Gene microarray analysis of tumors from control
and GW9662-treated animals indicated that 356 genes
were differentially affected by GW9662 treatment (Figure
3B). Of the 303 genes downregulated by GW9662, 24%
were metabolic genes, and 55% of which contain PPREs
(Table 1). In addition, there were 10 genes regulated
by transcription factors Cebpa and Pouf1, which are
PPAR-regulated. Overall, 67% of the metabolic genes
were directly or indirectly regulated by GW9662. Gene
ontology of the differentially expressed genes (Table
S1) indicated that the largest percentage were associated
with transport, glucose and lipid metabolism, and
developmental processes (Table 2). Pathway linkage
analysis revealed that most of the genes whose expression
was downregulated by GW9662 were linked directly or
indirectly to PPARγ (Figure 4), whereas, those genes
whose expression was increased by GW9662 were
connected to Mapk3, Mapk8 and Akt signaling (Figure
S1). Interestingly, the majority of the genes upregulated
by GW9662 were associated with transcription, splicing,
processing and translation of RNA (Table S2). In

DISCUSSION
The present study was designed to determine if
pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ could sensitize
mammary tumor growth to antiestrogen therapy. This
concept was based on our previous finding that induction
of mammary carcinogenesis in transgenic mice expressing
the dominant-negative Pax8PPARγ fusion protein resulted
in increased ER expression and responsiveness to the
ER antagonist, fulvestrant [10]. MMTV-Pax8PPARγ
transgenic mice represent a rare mouse model in which
the mammary gland exhibits a progenitor cell phenotype
that results in the preferential development of ER+ rather
than ER- tumors of mixed lineage following progestin/
DMBA treatment [10, 28]. A similar mammary tumor
phenotype developed in caveolin-1 knockout mice that
was also associated with the induction of several stem/
progenitor cell markers, including RBM39 [27], as

found in the present study. RBM39 functions primarily
in RNA splicing and may also be a putative partner of
the co-activator Ncoa6/PRIP [29]. Thus, one unexpected
finding was that GW9662 upregulated a number of genes
associated with transcription, processing, splicing and
translation that likely contribute to the diversity of the
proteome [30].
GW9662 is an irreversible PPARγ antagonist [16],
although in vitro cell studies have also reported off-target
effects [24-26]. However, there are no in vivo studies that
have established whether GW9662 is PPARγ-selective.
In one instance, GW9662 was shown to reduce high fat
diet-induced obesity in rats when administered in the diet
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at a concentration of 0.1% [31], which was identical to
the GW9662 diet used in our study. GW9662 was also
shown to block the anti-inflammatory effects of the
PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, in endotoxin-induced
acute lung injury after intravenous administration [32].
Based on gene array profiling, we found that GW9662
elicited PPARγ specificity based on its direct and indirect
inhibitory effects on the expression of metabolic genes
known to be under the control of PPARs.
An important caveat to the use of GW9662
is its ability to induce a modest acceleration of
tumorigenesis when administered orally at the onset
of carcinogenesis. We also observed a similar effect in

353

Western Blotting

MMTV-Pax8PPARγ mice following progestin/DMBA
mammary carcinogenesis [10]. While this has not been
reported previously, the ability of GW9662 to inhibit
cell growth in vitro similarly to PPARγ agonists [24, 33,
34] suggests the presence of “off-target” effects. The
increase in tumorigenesis observed with GW9662 and the
dominant-negative Pax8PPARγ transgene suggests that
partial antagonists rather than full antagonists or drugs
with greater specificity may be a useful approach for
further studies. Clearly, additional pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic studies in vivo are needed to establish
the bioavailability and metabolic effects of GW9662.
Overall, the positive aspect of inhibiting PPARγ was its
ability to sensitize tumors to the ER antagonist fulvestrant,
suggesting the potential for such an approach for hormoneinsensitive malignancies.

Western blotting was carried out as previously
described [10]. Briefly, tissue was frozen in liquid
nitrogen and pulverized in a mortar and pestle, and mixed
with lysis buffer containing: 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP-40,
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 50
mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics). Following incubation on ice for 30
min, lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at
13,000 x g at 4oC. Protein concentrations were determined
by the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce), and 50 μg
of lysate was separated in a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel
(Invitrogen). After wet transfer, membranes were blocked
for 1 hr at room temperature in TBS (pH 7.4) containing
5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Primary
antibody was incubated overnight at 4°C, and secondary
antibody was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature.
Proteins were visualized with either SuperSignal West
Pico or SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal model

Gene Microarray Analysis

FVB wild-type (WT) mice were obtained from
Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y. All animal studies were
conducted under protocols approved by the Georgetown
University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol as
previously described [10, 35]. cRNA was synthesized
using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) protocol with
minor modifications as described [28]. Biotin-labeled
cRNA was fragmented for 35 min at 94°C and hybridized
overnight to an Affymetrix mouse 430A 2.0 GeneChip®
representing approximately 22,000 annotated mouse genes
by the Genomics and Epigenomics Shared Resource,
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown
University. Hybridization signals were detected with an
Agilent Gene Array scanner, and grid alignment and raw
data generation performed with Affymetrix GeneChip®
Operating software 1.1. Changes in gene expression with
a signal ≥300 (log2 ≥8.1) and ≥3-fold change [9, 35, 36]
were clustered hierarchically with CIMiner software
(National Cancer Institute, NIH). Array data are presented
in Table S2, and complete data files were deposited in the
GEO database under accession no. GSE33762.

Mammary carcinogenesis
Five week-old WT mice were treated with
medroxyprogesterone acetate and DMBA as previously
described [9, 28]. Briefly, mice were injected s.c. with
15 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension (DepoProvera?), and after seven days were administered four
weekly doses of 1 mg DMBA/0.1 ml cottonseed oil by
gavage. One day after the last dose of DMBA, mice were
divided into four groups of 10 mice each: 1) one group was
maintained on standard Purina Rodent Chow 5001, 2) one
group was maintained on chow supplemented with 0.1%
(w/w) GW9962, 2) one group was maintained on chow
supplemented with GW9662 and injected s.c. every other
week with 250 mg/kg fulvestrant (Faslodex®) and 4) one
group was injected with 250 mg/kg fulvestrant every other
week. GW9662 was provided by the Chemoprevention
Branch, NCI. The histopathology of the resulting tumors
is presented in Table S1.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol as previously described [10,
35]. One  µg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a total
volume of 20  µl using the Cloned AMV First-Strand
cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed
in triplicate in an ABI 7900 instrument (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBRGreen detection
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR primers were designed
using the primer design tool at http://www.idtdna.com/
Scitools/Applications/RealTimePCR/. Efficiencies of all

Antibodies
The source of antibodies, their dilution and use
were the following: rabbit anti-ERα (sc-542, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, 1:200 for IHC, 1:1,000 for western); rabbit
anti-PgR (sc-538, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200 for
IHC, 1:1,000 for western).
Immunohistochemistry
IHC analysis was carried out as previously described
[9, 10, 28].

primer sets (Table S1) were validated using a standard
curve of five serial cDNA dilutions in water in duplicate.
Primers were acceptable if the deviation from the slope
of the standard curve was <0.3, and if the melting curve
showed only one product. The expression of each target
gene was normalized to the expression of GAPDH, and
the relative quantification method was applied using
SDS2.3 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
