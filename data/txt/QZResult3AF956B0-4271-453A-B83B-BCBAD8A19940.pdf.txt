Abstract
Gene therapy trials in human breast, ovarian, and head and neck tumors indicate that adenovirus E1A can
sensitize cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo. Resistance to paclitaxel has been
reported to occur in cells expressing low levels of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a. In this article, we report
that FOXO3a is critical for E1A-mediated chemosensitization to paclitaxel. RNA interference–mediated knockdown
of FOXO3a abolished E1A-induced sensitivity to paclitaxel. Mechanistic investigations indicated that E1A indirectly
stabilized FOXO3a by acting at an intermediate step to inhibit a ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis pathway involving
the E3 ligase bTrCP and the FOXO3a inhibitory kinase IKKb. E1A derepressed this inhibitory pathway by stimulating
expression of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/C protein phosphatases, which by binding to the TGF-b–activated
kinase TAK1, inhibited its ability to activate IKKb and, thereby, to suppress bTrCP-mediated degradation of
FOXO3a. Thus, by stimulating PP2A/C expression, E1A triggers a signaling cascade that stabilizes FOXO3a and
mediates chemosensitization. Our ﬁndings provide a leap forward in understanding paclitaxel chemosensitization
by E1A, and offer a mechanistic rational to apply E1A gene therapy as an adjuvant for improving therapeutic
outcomes in patients receiving paclitaxel treatment. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6878–87. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Adenovirus type 5 E1A (E1A) was originally recognized as an
oncogene that could facilitate oncogenic transformation by
other viral and cellular oncogenes. However, E1A has not been
associated with human malignancies despite extensive efforts
to identify such a link (1). Instead, E1A was shown to have
antitumor activities by reversing the transformed phenotype,
inhibiting metastasis, and inducing apoptosis in multiple
transformed rodent cells and human cancer cell lines (2–6).
In addition to the tumor suppressor activities, expression of

the E1A gene in stably transfected normal ﬁbroblasts and
human cancer cells has been shown to induce sensitization
among different categories of anticancer drugs in vitro, including etoposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, TNF–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors, and paclitaxel in normal ﬁbroblasts and
in sarcoma, non–small cell lung, hepatocellular, ovarian, and
breast cancer cells (7–12). Furthermore, animal studies
showed that the combination of systemic E1A gene therapy
with paclitaxel signiﬁcantly enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and prolonged survival rates in the animal orthotopic
model in vivo (11, 13). Therefore, E1A is, at present, considered
a tumor suppressor gene and has been tested in multiple
clinical trials in a gene therapy setting for patients with breast
(14, 15), ovarian (2, 14), and head and neck cancers (15, 16). A
clinical study using E1A gene therapy combined with paclitaxel
has been initiated for treatment of ovarian cancer. Thus, it is
critical and timely to understand the detailed molecular
mechanisms that are associated with E1A-mediated chemosensitization, and future clinical trials using the combination
of chemotherapy with E1A gene therapy can be further
improved.
One of the molecular mechanisms by which E1A induces
chemosensitization is downregulation of Her-2/neu overexpression (8, 11). Recently, inhibition of Akt and activation of p38
was reported to provide a general cellular mechanism for E1Amediated chemosensitization (9, 17). Regulation of some critical tumor suppressors was also proposed as being involved in
E1A-induced chemosensitization, such as p53 and p19ARF (18),
the proapoptotic protein Bax, caspase 9, and a yet-unidentiﬁed

FOXO3a Is Involved in Chemosensitization

inhibitor that ordinarily provides protection against cell death
(11, 19–22).
Forkhead box O–class (FOXO) transcription factors include
FOXO1 (FKHR; Forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma), FOXO3a
(FKHRL1; FKHR-like 1), and FOXO4 (AFX; acute lymphocytic
leukemia–fused gene from chromosome X). The FOXOs
activate and/or repress transcription of genes involved in
metabolism, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and cell-cycle
progression (23). For example, FOXO3a has been shown to
enhance p27kip expression and induce cell-cycle arrest (24).
Furthermore, FOXO3a and FOXO4 have been shown to inhibit
the cell cycle through downregulation of cyclin D by a p27kipindependent mechanism (25, 26). In breast cancer, FOXO3a has
been shown to upregulate Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only
protein (25, 27). The activity of the FOXOs can be inhibited
by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. FOXO3a can be phosphorylated by Akt at 3 conserved
serine/threonine residues (Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315), and it
subsequently translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,
where it is retained by binding to the 14-3-3 protein (28).
FOXO3a activity can also be inhibited by the IkB kinase (IKK)
signaling pathway. IKK physically interacts with and phosphorylates FOXO3a independently of Akt, which causes nuclear exclusion of FOXO3a and, subsequently, proteolysis of
FOXO3a via the bTrCP-mediated ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent
proteasome pathway (29). Recently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) was also shown to phosphorylate FOXO3a at
Ser-294, Ser-344, and Ser-425 sites, which enhance interaction
with the E3 Ub ligase MDM2, resulting in FOXO3a degradation
(30). However, the biologic function and detailed molecular
mechanism of FOXO3a proteolysis in E1A-mediated chemosensitization are still unclear.
In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism
of E1A-mediated chemosensitization, we found that FOXO3a
is critical to that process. E1A stabilizes FOXO3a by preventing
bTrCP-mediated Ub-dependent proteolysis through inhibiting
the phosphorylation of FOXO3a at Ser-644 by IKKb. E1A
induces the expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A;
a protein phosphatase involved in multiple cellular
functions, including chemosensitization), which inhibits
TGF-b–activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-activated IKK signaling,
thus stabilizing FOXO3a and inducing chemosensitization.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, DNA constructs, and antibodies
Cells of the cell lines MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and MDA-157
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM)/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. The human
breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and its E1A/vectorstable transfectants have been described previously (31). The
transfectants were grown under the same conditions as the
controls, except that G418 was added to the culture medium.
Cell lines have been characterized using DNA analysis by
STR ﬁngerprinting (HeLa, March 2009; MDA-MB-231,
December 2010; MDA-MB-157, ongoing). Cell lines were
frozen after they were received from the ATCC and had not

Committee of China Medical University (Taichung, Taiwan).

Results
FOXO3a is critical for E1A-mediated chemosensitization
E1A gene therapy has been shown to induce chemosensitization among different chemotherapeutic agents, including
paclitaxel in breast and ovarian cancers (33). It has been shown
that resistance to paclitaxel occurs in cells expressing low
levels of FOXO3a (34). We, therefore, speculated whether
FOXO3a might contribute to E1A-mediated chemosensitization. To this end, we examined the effects of E1A on FOXO3a
expression in various types of cancer cells including MDA-MB231, HeLa, and MDA-MB-157 and found that expression of
FOXO3a was signiﬁcantly increased in E1A-transfected cells
(Fig. 1A). We found that FOXO3a-regulated apoptotic genes,
such as FasL and p27, were increased in E1A-transfected cells
and decreased by FOXO3a knockdown (Supplementary Fig.
S1A) and involved in E1A-mediated chemosensitization (Supplementary Fig. S1B). More importantly, E1A-induced chemosensitization of paclitaxel was abolished by knockdown of
FOXO3a expression using FOXO3a-speciﬁc small interfering
RNA (siFOXO3a) in E1A-transfected MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and
MDA-MB-157 cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, E1Ainduced chemosensitization of doxorubicin and cisplatin was
reduced by knockdown of FOXO3a (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Using the established stable transfectants, we further investigated the effects of FOXO3a on E1A-mediated chemosensitization in a xenograft tumor model in which mice were injected
orthotopically with stably transfected cell clones. The results
indicated that E1A induces the chemosensitization of paclitaxel in vivo, in that the tumor volume in 231/E1A-bearing mice
treated with paclitaxel was signiﬁcantly less than that in 231/
vector-bearing mice treated with paclitaxel (810.7  73.2 mm3
vs. 1,648.7  237.4 mm3; Fig. 1C, lane 6 vs. lane 2). E1A-induced
chemosensitization to paclitaxel was abolished by knockdown
of the expression of FOXO3a by stable expression of siFOXO3a
in 231/E1A cells (810.7  73.2 mm3 vs. 1,855.1  135.8 mm3; Fig.
1C, lane 6 vs. lane 8). Increased tumor volumes by siFOXO3a
treatment in 231/E1A correlated well with reduced FOXO3a
expression in the tumors (Fig. 1D). We, therefore, concluded
that FOXO3a is required for the E1A-mediated chemosensitization to paclitaxel.
E1A prevents Ub-dependent proteolysis of FOXO3a
Posttranslational modiﬁcation and regulation of FOXO3a
protein stability are critical for FOXO3a activity (29). Therefore,
we attempted to determine the stability of FOXO3a protein in
response to E1A in breast cancer cells. For this analysis, we
treated control vector and E1A-expression vector-stable transfectants (231/vector and 231/E1A) with cycloheximide for

various times to block de novo protein synthesis and found
that the half-life of FOXO3a protein was more than 7 hours for
E1A-transfected cells but less than 1.5 hours for control cells by
using Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). TNFa-mediated FOXO3a
polyubiquitination (29) was signiﬁcantly decreased in 231/E1A
cells compared with that in 231/vector cells (Fig. 2B). These
results indicate that E1A increases FOXO3a protein expression
by preventing Ub-dependent proteolysis of FOXO3a.
bTrCP is involved in E1A-induced FOXO3a induction
bTrCP oncogenic Ub E3-ligase interacts with FOXO3 and
induces its Ub-dependent degradation in an IKKb phosphorylation dependent manner (27). Thus, we asked whether bTrCP
was involved in E1A-mediated FOXO3a protein stabilization.
To this end, we ﬁrst asked whether bTrCP physically interacted
with FOXO3a. We analyzed proteasome inhibitor MG132-treated 231/vector and 231/E1A cell lysates by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation (IP) followed by immunoblotting (IB)
using antibodies against FOXO3a and bTrCP. Our results
showed that endogenous FOXO3a was associated with endogenous bTrCP in vivo in 231/vector cells and this interaction was
stimulated by TNFa treatment. Interestingly, TNFa-induced
binding between FOXO3a and bTrCP was signiﬁcantly reduced
in E1A-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, bTrCP was shown
to be required for maintenance of low FOXO3a expression by
using siRNA of bTrCP. Transfection with sibTrCP increased
FOXO3a expression in 231/vector but not in 231/E1A cells (Fig.
2D). In addition, knockdown of bTrCP abolished the association between FOXO3a and bTrCP (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
these results indicate that E1A inhibits interaction of FOXO3a
and bTrCP, which may prevent FOXO3a degradation.
Inhibition of TAK1-IKK signaling is required for E1Amediated prevention of bTrCP/FOXO3a interaction and
chemosensitization
It is known that bTrCP interacts with FOXO3 and induces its
Ub-dependent degradation in an IKKb–phosphorylationdependent manner (29). To deﬁne whether E1A-mediated
FOXO3a stabilization is attributable to prevention of FOXO3a
phosphorylation by IKKb and subsequent recognition by
bTrCP, we investigated the association between FOXO3a and
bTrCP in 231/vector and 231/E1A cells transfected with IKKbexpression plasmid or control vector. Notably, transfection
with the IKKb expression vector reestablished the association
between FOXO3a and bTrCP in 231/E1A cells (Fig. 3A, left). To
further investigate whether inactivation of IKKb by E1A is
required for E1A-induced chemosensitization, we transiently
transfected E1A expression vector with or without IKKb
expression vector into MDA-MB-231 cells and determined the
effects of paclitaxel-induced cell death. E1A-induced chemosensitization was strikingly suppressed by transfection with
IKKb expression vector (Fig. 3A, right), supporting the notion
that E1A-repressed IKKb activity is required for E1A-mediated

(siControl) or FOXO3a siRNA (siFOXO3a). Each column represents the mean  SD of 8 primary tumors.  , P < 0.05 versus column 2 values, by the 2-tailed

FOXO3a protein and E1A was examined by immunoblotting assays using MDA-MB-231/vector tumors or MDA-MB-231/E1A tumors stably transfected with
either control siRNA (siControl) or FOXO3a siRNA (siFOXO3a) in combination with paclitaxel treatment.

of FOXO3a and bTrCP was analyzed by Western blotting. Lysates of 231/vector or 231/E1A cells transfected with sibTrCP or control siRNA in the
presence of MG132 (5 mmol/L) were analyzed by IP/IB (anti-FOXO3a/anti-bTrCP).

paclitaxel chemosensitization. To determine whether the Ser644–phosphorylated FOXO3a is capable of reestablishing the
association between FOXO3a and bTrCP in 231/E1A cells, we
transfected the GFP-tagged Ser-644 phosphorylation-mimic
mutant FOXO3a, GFP-FOXO3a-S644E, into 231/vector and
231/E1A cells. Expression of GFP-FOXO3a-S644E reestablished
the association between FOXO3a and bTrCP in 231/E1A cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The above-described data indicated
that phosphorylation of FOXO3a at Ser-644 is critical for the
association between FOXO3a and bTrCP. To further deﬁne
whether Akt and ERK signaling pathways are involved in E1Amediated FOXO3a expression and paclitaxel chemosensitization, we modulated these 2 kinases by a speciﬁc inhibitor or
genetic modulation. On one hand, E1A-induced FOXO3a
expression and chemosensitization were suppressed by transfection with constitutively activated Akt (Myr-Akt) expression

vector (Supplementary Fig. S3). On the other hand, we found
that treatment with a MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor,
U0126, slightly increased FOXO3a expression and paclitaxel
chemosensitization in 231/vector cells but not in 231/E1A cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The above-described data indicate
that the Akt but not ERK signaling pathway may also be
involved in E1A-mediated FOXO3a regulation and paclitaxel
chemosensitization.
To explore the mechanism(s) through which inhibition of
IKK activity participates in the cellular responses to E1A, we
determined the phosphorylation of IKK in 231/vector and 231/
E1A cells. Consistent with a previous report (35), treatment
with TNFa increased the phosphorylation of IKK in 231/vector
cells, but this activation was abolished in 231/E1A cells (Fig.
3B). These data indicated that E1A-induced inhibition of IKK
signaling may target the upstream kinase of IKK. Recent

evidence indicates that TAK1 is essential for the activation of
IKK in multiple signaling pathways (26). Therefore, we investigated the possible involvement of TAK1 in E1A-mediated
inhibition of IKK signaling, FOXO3a stabilization, and chemosensitization. We found that treatment with TNFa increased
the phosphorylation of TAK1 in 231/vector cells, and this
TNFa-induced phosphorylation was diminished by expression
of E1A (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, transfection with the HA-TAK1
expression vector signiﬁcantly increased phosphorylation of
IKK, and the E1A-mediated downregulation of p-IKK was
overcome by the forced expression of HA-TAK1 (Fig. 3C, left).
Experiments were also carried out to ascertain whether TAK1

(Fig. 3C, right). Consistently, E1A-mediated chemosensitization to paclitaxel was signiﬁcantly impaired by expression of
TAK1 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that TAK1,
the upstream kinase of IKK, is a critical regulator for E1Arepressed FOXO3a interaction with bTrCP and is required for

Phosphorylation of protein kinases is tightly regulated by
related protein phosphatases, and it has been reported that
E1A increases the expression of PP2A/C, the catalytic
subunit of PP2A (14). Because E1A inhibits TAK1 phosphorylation, we asked whether PP2A might be involved in E1Amediated dephosphorylation of TAK1 and IKK and FOXO3a
stabilization. To this end, 231/vector and 231/E1A cells were

treated with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA).
We found that E1A-mediated inhibition of TNFa-induced
TAK1 phosphorylation was restored by OA treatment, as
were E1A-mediated inhibition of IKK phosphorylation and
the interaction between FOXO3a and bTrCP (Fig. 4A). Consistently, E1A-induced chemosensitization was also decreased
in 231/E1A cells by treatment with OA (Fig. 4B). We next
examined whether PP2A binds to TAK1. As shown in Fig.
4C, treatment with TNFa notably increased the interaction
between TAK1 and IKK in 231/vector cells but not in 231/E1A
cells. Moreover, PP2A/C formed a complex with TAK1 in 231/
E1A cells and severely impaired the TNFa-induced interaction
between TAK1 and IKK (Fig. 4C).
To conﬁrm this novel binding between PP2A and TAK1, we
transfected 231/vector and 231/E1A cells with siRNA for
catalytic subunit of PP2A, PP2A/C, (siPP2A/C) to target knock-

down of PP2A/C protein and then measured the binding
preference of TAK1. Transfection with siPP2A/C, but not with
control siRNA, decreased E1A-induced PP2A/C expression
(Fig. 4C), and accordingly affected the binding complex of
TAK1 and PP2A/C in 231/E1A cells. Interestingly, the formation of TAK1/IKKb complex was signiﬁcantly increased by
siPP2A/C (Fig. 4C, lane 7). E1A-mediated inhibition of the
interaction between FOXO3a and bTrCP was also restored by
knockdown of siPP2A/C (Fig. 4D, lane 7). These ﬁndings
indicate that E1A-induced PP2A/C expression is required for
regulation of TAK1/IKK signaling, bTrCP/FOXO3a interaction,
and chemosensitization.
In summary, we found that FOXO3a is critical for E1Amediated chemosensitization. E1A stabilizes FOXO3a by
inducing the expression of PP2A/C and results in enhanced
PP2A phosphatase activity. The enhanced PP2A/C interacts

FOXO3a Is Involved in Chemosensitization

Figure 5. A model of molecular
mechanisms involved in E1Amediated chemosensitization. In
this model E1A stabilizes FOXO3a
by inducing the expression of
PP2A/C, which inhibits the
activation of IKKb through binding
and inactivation of TAK1, thus
inhibiting IKKb-mediated FOXO3a
phosphorylation at Ser-644 and
preventing bTrCP-induced
FOXO3a degradation and, thereby,
inducing chemosensitization.

and dephosphorylates TAK1 to inactivate TAK1, which also
renders inactivation of IKKb, thus inhibiting IKKb-mediated
interaction between bTrCP and FOXO3a and preventing
bTrCP-induced FOXO3a degradation (Fig. 5).

Discussion
E1A is associated with many antitumor activities and has
been tested in multiple clinical trials. Studies have shown that,
although E1A gene therapy is safe and well tolerated, the tumor
response to it is only modest (14–16). However, E1A has been
shown to induce sensitization to apoptosis induced by different categories of anticancer drugs; therefore, one improvement
that might render E1A more useful as an anticancer therapy is
the combination of E1A gene therapy with conventional chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is a front-line chemotherapeutic agent
for the treatment of human breast and ovarian cancer. One of
the mechanisms that paclitaxel uses to induce apoptosis in
cancer cells is through increasing Bim (proapoptotic BH3-only
protein) expression by activated FOXO3a activity (34). In the
present study, we found that E1A can stabilize FOXO3a, thus

sensitizing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to paclitaxelinduced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. This result provides
a molecular mechanism for stronger antitumor strategy by
combination of E1A gene therapy and paclitaxel chemotherapy
(11, 13, 33). It should be mentioned that the identiﬁed molecular mechanism for E1A-induced FOXO3a expression was not
observed in the MDA-MB-468 cell line, indicating that this
mechanism might be cell-type speciﬁc.
We found that E1A can protect FOXO3a from degradation by
inhibiting its ubiquitination, although previous studies showed
that FOXO3a can be targeted by the proteasome pathway after
being phosphorylated by Akt or IKK (28, 29). It is worth
mentioning that FOXO3a was also shown to be phosphorylated
by Erk at different sites and the phospho-FOXO3a by Erk can
be degraded by an E3-Ub ligase MDM2 (30). Our data indicate
that the ERK signaling pathway may not be involved in E1Amediated FOXO3a regulation and paclitaxel chemosensitization. Although the mechanism is not yet clear, a possible reason
that the ERK signaling may not be involved could be that ERKmediated degradation of FOXO3a, unlike Akt and IKK, occurs
through MDM2 (30), and E1A can regulate members of the

MDM2 family. For instance, it is known that E1A can bind to
MDM4 to inhibit MDM2-induced degradation of p53 (36).
Recently, a study has indicated that bTrCP1 oncogenic E3-Ub
ligase interacts with FOXO3 and induces its Ub-dependent
degradation in an IKKb phosphorylation–dependent manner
(37). In our study, we found that bTrCP can physically bind to
FOXO3a and mediate its degradation and that E1A stabilizes
FOXO3a by inhibiting the binding of FOXO3a to bTrCP. bTrCP
is the substrate-recognition subunit of the Skp1 Cullin1 F-box
protein E3-Ub protein ligase that can recognize speciﬁcally
phosphorylated substrates and confer their ubiquitination.
bTrCP plays a key role in the NF-kB signaling pathway by
recognizing IKK-phosphorylated IkB and mediating its degradation (38). Our ﬁndings revealed a new substrate of bTrCP that
requires phosphorylation by IKK. Previous studies showed that
IKK can phosphorylate FOXO3a at Ser-644 and cause FOXO3a
nuclear exclusion (29). Consistent with the report by Tsai and
colleagues (37), we found that Ser-644 phosphorylation mediated by IKK is also required for FOXO3a binding to bTrCP and
for further degradation induced through bTrCP. E1A prevents
the binding of bTrCP to FOXO3a by inhibiting the IKK-mediated FOXO3a phosphorylation at Ser-644.
IKK activation requires its phosphorylation by upstream
kinases, including TAK1 (39), and phosphorylation plays a
signiﬁcant role in TAK1 activation (40). We found, in this
study, that E1A inhibits FOXO3a binding to bTrCP by preventing TAK1 activation and its effect on IKK activation. It was
previously shown that TRAF6 and RIP1 can activate TAK1 and
lead to IKK phosphorylation and activation (41, 42). However,
overexpression of TRAF6 or RIP1 in E1A-stable cell lines did
not restore TAK1 activation and mediate FOXO3a degradation
(data not shown), indicating that prevention of TAK1 activation by E1A is not mediated by these 2 upstream activators. It
is known that PP2A phosphatase activity is enhanced in
E1A-expressing cells through E1A-mediated upregulation of
PP2A/C expression, which results in repression of Akt activation (17). A previous study indicates that PP2A functions as a
negative regulator in TGF-b1–induced TAK1 activation (43).
Therefore, E1A-mediated upregulation of PP2A/C is involved
in TAK1 inactivation and inhibits the binding of TAK1 to IKK,
which abolishes the function of IKK in phosphorylating
FOXO3a, resulting in the stabilization of FOXO3a.
The activities of protein kinases are ﬁnely regulated by
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; however, little is
known about the dephosphorylation and respective protein
phosphatase involved in the regulation of TAK1. PP2A is a
ubiquitously expressed protein serine/threonine phospha-

tase that accounts for the tumor suppression activity in
eukaryotic cells. Mutation of PP2A was found in human
breast, colon, and lung cancers, and in melanoma (44). In
addition, a variety of mechanisms for inactivating PP2A were
found to be involved in transformed cells. PP2A can be
inhibited by the small T antigen of the DNA tumor virus
SV40 (45), by upregulation of the c-Myc-speciﬁc inhibitor
CIP2A (46), or through the upregulation of SET protein by
the BCR/ABL oncogene (47). It was previously shown that
PP2A can suppress Akt (17) and RalA (48) activation, thus
inhibiting both PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways (49).
We found, in this study, that TAK1 is a target of PP2A/C in
another important signaling pathway—the IKK pathway
(50). Therefore, PP2A may inhibit the 3 major oncogenic
kinase pathways, PI3K/Akt, ERK, and IKK, to exert its tumor
suppressor activity. E1A, through upregulation of PP2A/C to
stimulate PP2A phosphatase activity, may share these same
pathways to suppress tumor development.
