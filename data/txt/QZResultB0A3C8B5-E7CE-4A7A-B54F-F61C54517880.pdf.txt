Abstract

Author Manuscript

Melanoma is notable for its metastatic propensity, lethality in the advanced setting, and
association with ultraviolet (UV) exposure early in life1. To obtain a comprehensive genomic view
of melanoma, we sequenced the genomes of 25 metastatic melanomas and matched germline
DNA. A wide range of point mutation rates was observed: lowest in melanomas whose primaries
arose on non-UV exposed hairless skin of the extremities (3 and 14 per Mb genome), intermediate
in those originating from hair-bearing skin of the trunk (range = 5 to 55 per Mb), and highest in a
patient with a documented history of chronic sun exposure (111 per Mb). Analysis of wholegenome sequence data identified PREX2 - a PTEN-interacting protein and negative regulator of
PTEN in breast cancer2 - as a significantly mutated gene with a mutation frequency of
approximately 14% in an independent extension cohort of 107 human melanomas. PREX2
mutations are biologically relevant, as ectopic expression of mutant PREX2 accelerated tumor
formation of immortalized human melanocytes in vivo. Thus, whole-genome sequencing of human
melanoma tumors revealed genomic evidence of UV pathogenesis and discovered a new
recurrently mutated gene in melanoma.

Author Manuscript

To gain a comprehensive view of the genomic landscape in human melanoma tumors, we
sequenced the genomes of twenty-five metastatic melanomas and peripheral blood obtained
from the same patients (Supplementary Table S1). Two tumors (ME015 and ME032) were
metastases from cutaneous melanomas arising on glabrous (or hairless) skin of the
extremities, representing the acral subtype. The other tumors were primarily metastases from
melanomas originating on hair-bearing skin of the trunk (the most common clinical
subtype). Further, ME009 represented a metastasis from a primary melanoma with a clinical
history of chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure.
We obtained 59-fold mean haploid genome coverage for tumor and 32-fold for normal DNA
(Supplementary Table S2). On average, 78,775 somatic base substitutions per tumor were
identified, consistent with prior reports3,4 (Supplementary Table S3). This corresponded to
an average mutation rate of 30 per megabase (Mb). However, the mutation rate varied by

nearly two orders of magnitude across the 25 tumors (Fig. 1). The acral melanomas showed
mutation rates comparable to other solid tumor types (3 and 14 mutations per megabase)5,6,
whereas melanomas from the trunk harbored substantially more mutations, in agreement
with previous studies3,7,8. In particular, sample ME009 exhibited a striking rate of 111
somatic mutations per Mb, consistent with a history of chronic sun exposure.

Author Manuscript

In tumors with elevated mutation rates, most nucleotide substitutions were C/G > T/A
transitions consistent with UV irradiation9. The variations in mutation rate correlated with
differences in the UV mutational signature. For example, 93% of substitutions in ME009 but
only 36% in acral melanoma ME015 were C>T transitions (Fig. 1); these tumors contained
the highest and lowest base mutation rates, respectively (111 and 3 mutation per megabase).
Interestingly, the acral tumor ME032 also showed a discernible enrichment of UVassociated mutations (Fig. 1). Thus, genome sequencing readily confirmed the contribution
of sun exposure in melanoma etiology.

Author Manuscript

In agreement with prior studies7,9, we detected an overall enrichment for dipyrimidines at
C>T transitions. Analysis of intragenic C>T mutations yielded a significant bias against
C>T mutations on the transcribed strand for most melanomas, consistent with transcriptioncoupled repair (TCR) (Suppl. Fig. 1)3,7,10. Most commonly, C>T mutations occurred at the
3′ base of a pyrimidine dinucleotide (CpC or TpC) (Suppl. Fig. 2). In contrast, the C>T
mutations in sample ME009 (with hypermutation and chronic sun exposure history) more
often occurred at the 5′ base of a pyrimidine dinucleotide. As expected, the acral tumor
ME015 exhibited mutation patterns observed in non-UV associated tumor types11, such as
an increased mutation rate at CpG dinucleotides relative to their overall genome-wide
frequency (Suppl. Fig.2). These different mutational signatures suggest a complex
mechanism of UV mutagenesis across the clinical spectrum of melanoma, likely reflecting
distinct histories of environmental exposures and cutaneous biology.

We detected 9,653 missense, nonsense, or splice site mutations in 5,712 genes (out of a total
of 14,680 coding mutations; Supplementary Tables S4, S5), with an estimated specificity of
95% (Supplementary Methods). The BRAFV600E mutation was present in 16 of 25 tumors
(64%), including the acral melanoma ME015. NRAS was mutated in 9 of 25 tumors (36%) in
a mutually exclusive fashion with BRAF, with the exception of one non-canonical
substitution (NRAST50I) in the hypermutated sample ME009. We also identified 6 insertions
and 34 deletions in protein coding exons (Supplementary Table S6), including a 21-bp inframe deletion involving exon 11 of the KIT oncogene in the acral tumor ME032
(Supplementary Fig. S3). KIT mutations occur in 15% of acral and mucosal melanomas12,
and melanoma patients with activating KIT mutations in exon 11 have demonstrated marked
responses to imatinib treatment13.
We identified an average of 97 structural rearrangements per melanoma genome (range:
6-420) (Supplementary Table S7). In addition to displaying a wide range of rearrangement
frequencies, the proportion of intrachromosomal and interchromosomal rearrangements
varied widely across genomes. ME029, which harbored the largest number of
rearrangements (420), contained only 8 interchromosomal events (Fig. 2a). In contrast,
ME020 and ME035 contained 95 and 90 interchromosomal rearrangements, respectively

(Fig. 2a). In both cases, the vast majority of interchromosomal rearrangements were
restricted to two chromosomes. This pattern is reminiscent of chromothripsis14, a process
involving catastrophic chromosome breakage that has been observed in several tumor
types15,16.

Author Manuscript

106 genes harbored chromosomal rearrangements in two or more samples (Supplementary
Table S8). Many recurrently rearranged loci contain large genes or reside at known or
suspected fragile sites17; examples include FHIT (6 tumors), MACROD2 (5 tumors), and
CSMD1 (4 tumors). On the other hand, several known cancer genes were also recurrently
rearranged, including the PTEN tumor suppressor (4 tumors) and MAGI2 (3 tumors), which
encodes a protein known to bind and stabilize PTEN. MAGI2 was also found disrupted in
recent whole genome studies of prostate cancer18 and a melanoma cell line7.
Rearrangements involving the 5′ untranslated region of the ataxin 2-binding protein 1 gene
(A2BP1) were observed in 4 tumors. A2BP1 encodes an RNA binding protein whose genetic
disruption has been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases.
A2BP1 undergoes complex splicing regulation in the central nervous system and other
tissues19; in melanoma, these rearrangements may disrupt a known A2BP1 splice isoform or
enable a de novo splicing product. Together, these results suggest that chromosomal
rearrangements may contribute importantly to melanoma genesis or progression.

Author Manuscript

Acral melanoma (ME032) harbored the second-largest number of total rearrangements (314;
Fig. 2a). We employed high throughput PCR followed by massively parallel sequencing to
successfully validate 177 of 182 events tested in this sample, confirming its high rate of
rearrangement. The elevated frequency of genomic rearrangements in acral melanomas has
been reported previously20. In comparison, ME032 exhibited one of the lowest base pair
mutation rates of the melanomas examined (21st out of 25 samples), suggesting that different
tumors might preferentially enact alternative mechanisms of genomic alteration to drive
tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

As noted above, many rearrangements in ME032 involved multiple breakpoints within a
narrow genomic interval. One such event disrupted the ETV1 locus. We previously
demonstrated an oncogenic role for ETV1 in melanoma, whose dysregulated expression was
associated with upregulation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)21,
the master melanocyte transcriptional regulator and a melanoma lineage survival
oncogene22. We validated 6 distinct rearrangements (4 interchromosomal translocations) in
ME032 involving breakpoints within ETV1 introns (Fig. 2b). These events join regions of
ETV1 to distal loci on chromosomes 8, 9, 11, and 15. In support of their possible functional
relevance, these rearrangements were associated with high-level ETV1 amplification in this
tumor.
A second complex rearrangement involved the PREX2 locus. PREX2 encodes a
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate RAC exchange factor recently shown to interact
with the PTEN tumor suppressor and modulate its function2. We validated 9 somatic
rearrangements in the vicinity of PREX2 (6 interchromosomal translocations), including 5
with intronic breakpoints (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. S4). One event joined specific
intronic regions of PREX2 and ETV1. Like ETV1, PREX2 is highly amplified in this tumor,

as verified by FISH analysis (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. S5). The presence of these
complex structural rearrangements in addition to amplification may indicate multiple
mechanisms of PREX2 dysregulation in melanoma. More generally, these findings raised the
possibility that sites of complex rearrangement might denote genes of functional importance
in melanoma.

Next, we calculated the mutational significance of each gene based on the number of
mutations detected, gene length, and background mutation rates (Table 1, Supplementary
Table S9) (See Methods). Eleven genes were found to be significantly mutated across the 25
samples (q < 0.01). As expected, the two most significant genes were BRAF and NRAS,
mutated in 16 and 9 samples, respectively. Interestingly, PREX2 scored as one of the top
significant genes (Table 1). Furthermore, 4 samples harbored nonsense truncation mutations
in PREX2, more than any of the other genes identified as statistically significant in this
analysis. PREX2 mutations have occasionally been reported in colon, lung, and pancreatic
cancer23, albeit at low frequencies. Here, we detected 13 non-synonymous point mutations
in PREX2 — including 4 nonsense mutations — and 1 synonymous mutation, with 11 of 25
melanomas harboring at least 1 non-synonymous mutation. The mutations were distributed
throughout the entire length of PREX2 (Fig. 3a, green circles), and 13 of 14 mutations were
non-synonymous, suggestive of strong positive selection. An analysis of the mutant allele
frequencies and estimated tumor purities indicates that at least 2 mutations are homozygous.
One melanoma, ME018, harbors 3 missense mutations, two of which (I534M and G1581R)
appear to co-occur on a single allele based on their observed mutation frequencies. Notably,
a PREX2 nonsense mutation was detected in ME032, in addition to the rearrangements and
amplification of this locus present in this tumor (Fig. 2c). This PREX2 mutation was
truncating (E824*), removing the C-terminal region with homology to an inositol
phosphatase domain. Based on the allele frequency of this mutation, we infer that it occurs
on the non-amplified allele. Taken together, whole-genome sequencing of this 25-sample
discovery cohort identified PREX2 as a candidate melanoma gene whose amplifications,
rearrangements or mutations appeared to undergo positive selection in human melanoma
genesis.

Author Manuscript

To determine the prevalence of PREX2 mutations in melanoma, we performed bidirectional
capillary sequencing in an extension cohort of 107 tumor/normal pairs, comprising 45
tumors and 62 short-term cultures collected from multiple institutions and geographic
regions (Supplementary Table S10). We identified 23 somatic base pair mutations and one
frame-shift insertion in PREX2 in this cohort (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table S11), 15 of
which represented non-synonymous changes. We therefore inferred a 14% frequency of
non-synonymous PREX2 mutations in this melanoma cohort.
Discrepant non-synonymous:synonymous ratios were observed between the tumor samples
and short-term cultures in the extension cohort. In line with results from the discovery
cohort, 100% of PREX2 mutations detected across 45 tumor samples were non-synonymous
in nature (n = 4), consistent with positive selection. In contrast, only 55% of the sequence
mutations found in the 64 short-term cultures were non-synonymous (a ratio of 11:9).
Conceivably, these findings may indicate that subsets of melanoma cells capable of robust
growth in vitro may have experienced reduced selective pressure for PREX2 mutations.

Alternatively (or in addition), the PREX2 locus may exhibit an enhanced “local” mutation
rate, a by-product of which is the production of variants that undergo positive selection in
vivo.

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate the functional relevance of PREX2 mutations in melanoma tumorigenesis,
we ectopically expressed six representative mutations (three truncation variants and three
non-synonymous point mutations predicted to carry functional impact24) in TERTimmortalized human melanocytes engineered to express NRAS(G12D) (PMEL-NRAS*)21.
These melanocytic lines were transplanted into immunodeficient mice alongside control
melanocytes expressing either wild-type PREX2 or GFP. Overexpression of all 3 truncated
variants as well as a point mutant (G844D) of PREX2 significantly accelerated in vivo
tumorigenesis when compared to GFP control or WT PREX2 expressing melanocytes (Fig.
3b, Supplementary Fig. 6). These results therefore affirmed the aforementioned genomic
data suggesting that PREX2 mutations may undergo positive selection in vivo. Although the
spectrum of PREX2 mutations in human melanoma (Fig. 3a) is reminiscent of inactivating
mutations, our findings suggest that PREX2 somatic mutations generate truncated or variant
proteins that gain oncogenic activity in melanoma cells.

Author Manuscript

In summary, following recent efforts to characterize whole genomes from several
hematologic and solid tumors, we provide the first high-resolution view of the genomic
landscape across a spectrum of metastatic melanoma tumors. The analysis reveals global
genomic evidence for the role of UV mutagenesis in melanoma, and identifies several
recurrently mutated and rearranged genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. In
particular, we discovered that PREX2 mutations are both recurrent and functionally
consequential in melanoma biology. Although its precise mechanism(s) of action remain to
be elucidated in melanoma, PREX2 appears to acquire oncogenic activity through mutations
that perturb or inactivate one or more of its cellular functions. This pattern of mutations may
exemplify a category of cancer genes that is distinct from “classic” oncogenes (often
characterized by highly recurrent gain-of-function mutations) and tumor suppressors
(inactivated by simple loss-of-function alterations). Instead, (over)expression of certain
cancer genes with distributed mutation patterns may promote tumorigenicity either through
dominant negative effects or more subtle dysregulation of normal protein functions.

Author Manuscript

Cancer genomics has enabled the discovery and rational application of the first truly
effective targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma: BRAF mutations predict sensitivity to
selective RAF inhibitors25-27. However, the emergence of acquired resistance is rapid and
often driven by other genomic events28. Our genomic exploration of the melanoma genomes
revealed a large number of complex alterations that likely impact on many other genes in
addition to PREX2. Understanding how this spectrum of genomic aberrations contributes to
melanoma genesis and progression should provide new insights into tumor biology,
therapeutic resistance, and developing treatment regimens aimed at durable control of this
malignancy.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

The complete genomes of 25 metastatic melanomas and patient-matched germline samples
were sequenced to approximately 30x and 30x haploid coverage, respectively, on an
Illumina GAIIx sequencer (5 cases), and approximately 65x and 32x haploid coverage,
respectively, on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (20 cases) as paired-end 101-nucleotide
reads. Read pairs were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19) using BWA29.
Somatic alterations (single base substitutions, small insertions and deletions, and structural
rearrangements) were identified according to their presence in the tumor genome and
absence from the corresponding normal genome. A subset of rearrangements were validated
by PCR and an independent sequencing technology in order to assess the specificity of the
detection algorithm. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to confirm the
high level amplification and rearrangement of PREX2. Significantly mutated genes were
identified by comparing the observed mutations to the background mutation rates calculated
for different sequence context categories per tumor sample. 40 exons of PREX2 were
sequenced by PCR and bidirectional capillary sequencing in a validation panel of 107
additional melanoma tumors and short term cultures; mutations were confirmed as somatic
by sequencing matched normal DNA. For gain of function studies,PREX2 mutation
constructs were engineered and introduced to PMELcell lines by lentiviral transduction. To
assess the oncogenic roles of PREX2 mutants, PMEL-NRAS* cells were injected
subcutaneously into NUDE mice, and tumor growth was measured over time. A complete
description of the materials and methods is provided in the Supplementary Information. All
Illumina sequence data are publicly available in dbGaP (accession number
phs000452.v1.p1).

Figure 1.

Elevated mutation rates and spectra indicative of UV radiation damage. Top bar plot shows
somatic mutation rate of 25 sequenced melanoma genomes, in decreasing order. Middle
matrix indicates BRAF/NRAS somatic mutation status, with left-adjacent bar plot indicating
total number of mutations in each oncogene as well as percent frequency. Bottom plot
displays each tumor’s somatic mutation spectrum. Tumor sample names are indicated at the
bottom of the figure, with acral melanomas in red.

Hubs of rearrangement breakpoints affect known and putative oncogenes. (a) Circos plots
representing 4 melanoma genomes with notable structural alterations. Interchromosomal and
intrachromosomal rearrangements are shown in purple and green, respectively. (b) Location
of breakpoints associated with ETV1 in melanoma ME032. (c) Location of breakpoints
associated with PREX2 in melanoma ME032. The red arrow indicates a premature stop
codon (E824*). All rearrangements in ETV1 and PREX2 were validated by multiplexed PCR
and 454 sequencing. (d) Confirmation of high-level amplification and rearrangement in
PREX2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

Figure 3.

Mutant PREX2 expression promotes melanoma genesis. (a) Non-synonymous sequence
mutations detected from Illumina sequencing of 25 melanomas (green) or from capillary
sequencing of a validation cohort of 107 additional melanomas (purple). Mutations are
dispersed throughout all annotated structural domains of PREX2. (DH = DBL Homology
domain; PH = Plekstrin Homology domain). The C-terminal half of PREX2 exhibits
sequence homology to an inositol phosphatase domain. Engineered PREX2 mutants are
labeled with red arrowheads. (b) Kaplan-Meier curve showing tumor free survival of NUDE
mice (n=10) injected with pMEL-NRAS* cells expressing GFP, WT, truncated, and mutated
PREX2 subcutaneously.
