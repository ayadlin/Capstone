Abstract
Notch signaling is an area of great interest in oncology.
RO4929097 is a potent and selective inhibitor of ;-secretase,
producing inhibitory activity of Notch signaling in tumor
cells. The RO4929097 IC50 in cell-free and cellular assays is
in the low nanomolar range with >100-fold selectivity with
respect to 75 other proteins of various types (receptors, ion
channels, and enzymes). RO4929097 inhibits Notch processing in tumor cells as measured by the reduction of
intracellular Notch expression by Western blot. This leads
to reduced expression of the Notch transcriptional target
gene Hes1. RO4929097 does not block tumor cell proliferation or induce apoptosis but instead produces a less
transformed, flattened, slower-growing phenotype.
RO4929097 is active following oral dosing. Antitumor
activity was shown in 7 of 8 xenografts tested on an
intermittent or daily schedule in the absence of body weight
loss or Notch-related toxicities. Importantly, efficacy is
maintained after dosing is terminated. Angiogenesis reverse
transcription-PCR array data show reduced expression of
several key angiogenic genes. In addition, comparative
microarray analysis suggests tumor cell differentiation as
an additional mode of action. These preclinical results
support evaluation of RO4929097 in clinical studies using an
intermittent dosing schedule. A multicenter phase I dose
escalation study in oncology is under way. [Cancer Res
2009;69(19):7672–80]

Introduction
Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation
stemming from aberrant regulation of cellular signaling. Cellular
heterogeneity typical of tumors may be partly due to dysregulated differentiation (1). In recent years, developmental biology
research has provided new insights in understanding the signals
that control cancer. During development and tissue remodeling,
a self-renewing pluripotent progenitor cell population serves as
the source for all mature, differentiated cell types. A link
between the characteristics of these pluripotent cells and the

rapid uncontrolled proliferation of tumors is becoming clear (2).
One major developmental signaling axis is the evolutionarily
conserved Notch pathway (3–5). Notch signaling regulates cell
fate decisions by mediating the homeostasis and differentiation
of progenitor cells during development and self-renewal of adult
pluripotent stem cells. Notch functions to maintain progenitor
cells in a pluripotent state affecting differentiation, proliferation,
and survival. In cancer, Notch gene amplification, chromosomal
translocation, or mutation leads to elevated Notch signaling,
imparting a growth advantage by keeping tumor cells and tumor
stem cells in a pluripotent proliferative state (6). A similar
concept is emerging during tumor angiogenesis where Notch
signaling directs endothelial cell fate during new vessel
formation via the Notch ligands Dll4 and Jag1 (7, 8).
Intramembrane processing is an emerging theme for membrane
receptor signaling. g-Secretase is a key enzyme in the intramembrane proteolytic processing of receptors including the
amyloid precursor protein (APP), CD44, HER4, and Notch (9–11).
Notch signaling requires plasma membrane receptor interaction
(Notch1-4) with one of five transmembrane ligands (Jagged1,
Jagged2, Delta-like1, Delta-like3, and Delta-like4) expressed on
neighboring cells. This ligand-receptor interaction initiates a series
of intramembrane cleavages, the last of which is mediated by the
g-secretase enzyme complex. The g-secretase processing of Notch
produces the active form called intracellular Notch (ICN). ICN
translocates to the nucleus and forms part of a larger transcription
complex directly altering the expression of key proliferation- and
differentiation-specific genes (3). The strategy of blocking Notch
signaling via g-secretase inhibition holds the potential to target
tumor cells, tumor stem cells, and tumor endothelial cells.
Inhibition of these three key tumor cell populations could eradicate
tumor growth and neovascularization, ultimately leading to tumor
regression or terminal differentiation (stasis). Although inhibition
of Notch is an attractive tumor-targeting strategy, Notch plays an
essential physiologic role in regenerative tissues of the hematopoietic system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin (12). Prolonged
inhibition of Notch signaling in these target organs can therefore
be associated with in vivo toxicity.
The present study describes a novel g-secretase small-molecule
inhibitor. RO4929097 is a potent and selective g-secretase inhibitor
targeting cellular Notch processing. RO4929097 is orally active in 7
of 8 established preclinical tumor models, well below the maximum
tolerated exposure established in toxicity studies. Importantly,
acute intermittent dosing produces sustained efficacy, helping to
mitigate toxicity. These preclinical results support the continued
development of RO4929097, which is currently undergoing phase I
dose escalation in patients with solid tumors.

g-Secretase Inhibitor Targeting Notch Signaling

Materials and Methods
Compound. The test compound RO4929097 [2,2-dimethyl-N-((S)-6-oxo6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b, d]azepin-7-yl)-N¶-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-propyl)malonamide] was synthesized according to the procedure described in
patent application (WO2005/023772).
Cell lines. The human cancer cell lines A549, MDA-MB-468, LOVO,
BxPC3, HCT-116, AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2, and Calu-6 were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection. The H460a cell line was a gift from
Dr. Jack Roth (M. D. Anderson Medical Center).
In vitro potency assays. The cell-free assay for g-secretase was done as
described (13). The cellular Ah-lowering assay used human HEK293 cells
stably transfected with a vector expressing a cDNA of the human APP wildtype gene (APP695) as described (14). The cellular Notch reporter assay
used a stably transfected HEK293 cell line expressing the human Notch1
and luciferase reporter (15). Western blot analysis, soft-agar growth, RNA
isolation, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were done using
standard laboratory techniques. The catalogue numbers for each probe
set were Hes1 (Hs00172878_m1), c-myc (Hs00153408_m1), p21
(Hs00355782_m1), ACTB (4333762F), and 18S (4319413E). The catalogue
information for the Western blot antibodies were ICN (Cell Signaling; 2421)
at a dilution of 1:1,000, Hes1 (U.S. Biological; H2034-35) at a dilution of
1:1,000, and actin (Sigma; 5316) at a dilution of 1:10,000.
Xenograft tumor models. The in vivo efficacy experiments were
conducted as described (16). RO4929097 was formulated as a suspension in
1.0% Klucel in water with 0.2% Tween 80 for oral administration.
RO4929097-treated mice were orally dosed with suspensions at 3 to 60
mg/kg RO4929097 according to the indicated regimens. In the Calu-6
xenograft model, RO4929097 was dosed at 60 mg/kg/d every other week for
4 weeks (7+/7-  2 cycles). For all other xenograft models, RO4929097 was
dosed once daily at 10 mg/kg for 21 days. Statistical analysis was
determined by Mann-Whitney rank-sum test, one-way ANOVA, and post
hoc Bonferroni t test (SigmaStat version 2.0; Jandel Scientific). Differences
between groups were considered significant when P V 0.05. A549 tumors
from vehicle-treated and selected RO4929097-treated groups were collected
and fixed in 10% zinc-formalin overnight, processed, paraffin-embedded,
sectioned at 5 Am, and stained with H&E for histopathology assessment. An
Olympus BX51 microscope (40 objective) mounted with a Nikon DS-Fi1
using the NIS-Elements F2.20 program collected the histology pictures. For
Western blot analysis, three A549 tumors from each group, 7 (60 mg/kg) or
21 days (3 and 30 mg/kg), were flash-frozen. Collagen type V was detected
using the H-200 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology at a dilution of
1:1,000, and MFAP5 was detected using the antibody from Abnova at a
dilution of 1:1,000.
Angiogenesis RT-PCR array. cDNA samples prepared for Affymetrix
analysis were analyzed with the 384-well mouse angiogenesis PCR array in
duplicate (SABioscienses) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Microarray method. A549 and H460a cells were treated with either
RO4929097 or vehicle and harvested at 6 and 24 h. Total RNA was isolated
using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quality was assessed on the
Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Total RNA (15 Ag) was converted into cDNA and
cRNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the statistical analysis
of the expression measurements, an in-house implementation of the RMA
algorithm (17) was used to perform the background correction, normalization, and signal summarization. Differentially expressed genes were
further analyzed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis algorithm (18)
implemented by the NextBio software (NextBio).

Results
RO4929097 has potent ;-secretase in vitro inhibitory
activity. RO4929097 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the gsecretase enzyme complex. The primary dibenzazepinone core was
derived from LY411575 (19). Medicinal chemistry efforts produced
RO4929097 showing strong potency, selectivity, and drug-like
properties. Multiple in vitro assays were used to characterize the
potency and selectivity of RO4929097 (Fig. 1A). The primary in vitro

www.aacrjournals.org

assay used human cell-free membrane preparations to provide
the g-secretase enzyme complex. RO4929097 strongly inhibited
g-secretase enzyme activity with a 4 nmol/L potency (IC50; Fig. 1B).
The cellular processing of APP was measured using an ELISA
readout. HEK293 cells were engineered to overexpress APP.
Processing was measured by an ELISA-based quantitation of the
Ah 1-40 g-secretase product. Treatment of cells caused a dosedependent decrease in the amount of Ah peptides secreted into the
culture medium. Figure 1B shows a representative data set (EC50,
14 F 4 nmol/L; n = 4). Cellular Notch inhibitory activity was
measured using a HEK293 cell line stably expressing a truncated
human Notch1 fused in the intracellular domain to a VP16/Gal14
transcriptional activator, which drives a firefly luciferase gene.
Inhibition of Notch processing produced a reduction in luciferase
reporter activity as measured by chemiluminescence. The potent
in vitro activity of RO4929097 translated into strong dose-dependent
inhibition of Notch processing in the Notch cell-based reporter assay
(EC50, 5 F 1 nmol/L; n = 5). The potency of RO4929097 in cell-free
and cellular assays was in the low nanomolar range with >100-fold
selectivity observed with respect to 75 other proteins of various
types including receptors, ion channels, and enzymes (CEREP panel;
data not shown). No in vitro inhibitory activity was observed on
the closely related cathepsin D and BACE aspartyl proteases (data
not shown).
RO4929097 inhibits Notch processing in human tumorderived cells. Formation of the ICN protein following Notch
receptor cleavage by g-secretase is a critical step in Notch signaling
(3–5). ICN moves to the nucleus becoming part of a larger
transcriptional complex regulating the expression of various target
genes including Hes1. A549 non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC)–derived cells were treated with RO4929097 for 24 h.
The reduction in Hes1 mRNA levels was detected as early as
2 h following compound treatment and showed a dose-dependent
reduction beginning at 100 nmol/L (Fig. 2A). The reduction in
expression of ICN protein and the Notch target gene product,
Hes1, was monitored by Western blot. After 5 days of treatment,
RO4929097 suppressed the production of ICN in the human NSCLC
A549 cells inducing a flattened and less transformed tumor cell
phenotype in tissue culture (Fig. 2B and C). The morphology was
reminiscent of nontransformed primary bronchial epithelia cells
grown in tissue culture. A variety of tumor cell lines were treated
with RO4929097 including colon, breast, melanoma, and pancreatic
cell lines. All of the cell lines exhibited a similar flattened, less
transformed phenotype (data not shown). This translated into a
dose-dependent reduction in soft-agar growth in the MDA-MB-468
cell line (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the appearance of an apoptotic
phenotype following compound treatment was not observed. Cells
grown in the presence of RO4929097 showed little effect on overall
growth (data not shown). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis documents a modest cell cycle slowing at 5 Amol/L for
72 and 120 h (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table S1).
RO4929097 did not completely block tumor cell proliferation nor
induce apoptosis but instead elicited a slower-growing phenotype.
This mechanism is consistent with cellular Notch inhibition and
analogous to the role of Notch during normal tissue development
where progenitor cells adopt a new phenotype while continuing to
proliferate (5).
In vivo efficacy of RO4929097. The preclinical antitumor
activity was tested in the A549 NSCLC xenograft model using a
variety of doses and schedules in an attempt to ameliorate the
anticipated toxicities associated with inhibition of Notch signaling

in normal tissues such as in the gastrointestinal tract. Oral
administration of 3 to 60 mg/kg RO4929097 once daily (Fig 3A) or
twice daily (data not shown) to nude mice bearing A549 NSCLC
xenografts for either 7, 14, or 21 days of a 21-day schedule resulted
in significant tumor growth inhibition compared with vehicletreated animals (Fig. 3A). The tumor growth inhibition values
ranged from 66% to 91% (P < 0.001). Importantly, the antitumor
effects were sustained after dosing was completed.
When mice were treated with 60 mg/kg RO4929097 twice daily
with the 7+/14- schedule, treatment initially caused regression of
established A549 tumors. At the end of the 21-day cycle (day 47),
tumor growth inhibition was still 91% compared with vehicle
control mice. Inhibition of tumor growth remained prolonged and
sustained up to 34 days post-treatment (day 67). On day 67, these
mice were retreated with the same dose of RO4929097 for a second
cycle (7 days) until day 74 (Fig. 3B). Tumor growth continued to be
inhibited out to day 90. Similar results were observed when
RO4929097 was administered once daily or twice daily consecutively for 21 days, with treatment ending on day 47 post-tumor
implant. For all 21-day treated groups, inhibition of tumor growth
remained prolonged and sustained. It is of note that whether
RO4929097 was dosed once daily (Fig. 3C) or twice daily (data not
shown) with either the 14+/7- or full 21-day treatment schedule,
there was a general lack of dose response observed with respect to
tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 3C). Exposures producing efficacy
(AUC24 h) were f1,100 ng h/mL after an oral daily dosing schedule
of 10 mg/kg/d for 21 days. No change in exposure was observed
between days 1 and 21 (data not shown). The pharmacokinetics of
RO4929097 in mouse was characterized by a moderate to high
plasma clearance, high volume of distribution, and moderate to
high oral bioavailability.
The observed antitumor efficacy was unique compared with
that observed with other cancer therapeutics in that the efficacy
was prolonged after cessation of treatment and the maximal

efficacy was sometimes observed 1 or 2 weeks after treatment
ceased. This in vivo response supports a rationale around cyclical
dosing in the clinic. Both continuous daily and intermittent
schedules were efficacious without toxic (>20%) body weight loss
(Supplementary Fig. S2). However, there was less body weight loss
in mice on the intermittent schedule possibly due to the recovery
of normal stem cells.
Selected A549 tumors were collected at the end of the study for
histology assessment, Western blot analysis, and angiogenesis
gene analysis to further investigate the mechanism of action.
Histologic analysis of tumors harvested at the end of this study
revealed large areas of necrosis with an increase in extracellular
matrix (Fig. 4A).
Microarray analysis revealed mRNA expression changes consistent with extracellular matrix alteration (data not shown).
RO4929097-treated tumors were harvested for Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4B). Collagen type V expression was significantly
reduced, whereas MFAP5 protein expression was elevated. Collagen
type V and MFAP5 are structural proteins that make up the
extracellular matrix. The expression of the ICN was reduced
consistent with inhibiting Notch processing in vivo. Interestingly,
total Notch1 protein levels were also reduced, suggesting a
possible feedback loop where Notch regulates its own expression.
The inhibition of Notch ICN cleavage was somewhat reduced at the
high dose of 60 mg/kg. The loss of ICN inhibition is not unexpected
because these samples were collected at the end of the 21-day
study. This group of animals was on a 7-day dosing schedule
and had not been dosed for 14 days. This in contrast to the 3
and 30 mg/kg groups, which were on a 14-day dosing schedule
and had not been dosed for 7 days before tumor harvest.
Notch signaling has been reported to play a role in tumor
angiogenesis. RO4929097 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of
tubule formation in the cell-based AngioKit assay (data not shown).
An angiogenesis-specific RT-PCR array was used to investigate the

effect of RO4929097 on xenograft angiogenesis gene expression.
An important control was the inclusion of the H460a xenograft
because this model is nonresponsive to the in vivo inhibitory
effects of RO4929097 (Fig. 3D). Figure 4C presents the array data
showing a reduction in several key angiogenic mRNAs following
compound treatment in vivo including VEGFR2 (KDR), CD31
(PECAM1), and JAG1. Interestingly, there was little change in the
angiogenic genes survey for the H460a xenograft as expected given
the lack of efficacy in this model. These data are consistent with an
antiangiogenic mechanism of action for RO4929097.
Additional preclinical antitumor activity was evaluated in several
xenograft models using a standard daily dose of 10 mg/kg to allow
cross-study comparison of efficacy (Fig. 3D). RO4929097 is orally
active in 6 of 7 established tumor models in nude mice dosed below
the maximum tolerated dose on a daily schedule for 21 days and is
orally active in a seventh model on an intermittent schedule (Calu6 model dosed at 60 mg/kg 7+/7-  2 cycles). The lack of efficacy in
the H460a cell line serves as the basis for identifying a responder/
nonresponder molecular signature for RO4929097.
Pharmacodynamic effect of ;-secretase inhibition using a
rat hair follicle assay. Notch signaling occurs in a variety of

www.aacrjournals.org

normal tissues as part of the cell differentiation and regeneration
process. Our mRNA expression analysis revealed the hair follicle as a
tissue that uses the Notch signaling axis (data not shown), consistent
with published reports (20, 21). The hair follicle may represent a
surrogate tissue that could be used to monitor Notch inhibition
during clinical development of RO4929097. We sought to first
validate this approach by developing a RT-PCR assay to monitor the
Notch target gene, Hes1, in hair follicles following RO4929097 ex vivo
dosing. Both donor hair follicle mRNAs showed a significant
decrease in Hes1 mRNA expression and no change in c-myc mRNA
expression following compound treatment (Fig. 5A and B).
Key in vivo validation of this approach was achieved using a rat
hair follicle regrowth assay. A section of hair on the back of a
Fischer rat was removed because rodent hair follicles normally
exist in the resting telogen phase. Hair removal stimulates regrowth
and the hair follicles enter a period of growth and differentiation
called the anagen phase (20). Rats were dosed orally at 6 mg/kg
on a daily schedule and hair was harvested at the indicated times
(Fig. 5C, black triangles). Plasma exposures ranged from 111 to
176 ng/mL 2 h post-dose during the course of the experiment
in line with previous data. Hes1 mRNA levels were decreased by

24 h and remained reduced through the course of the experiment
(Fig. 5D). The c-myc and p21 mRNAs showed no expression change
in response to dosing.
Comparative microarray analysis of RO4929097 transcriptional effect. Inhibition of Notch signaling holds the potential to
inhibit three key areas of tumor survival: tumor cell growth, tumor
stem cell repopulation, and tumor angiogenesis (6, 7). It remains
unclear which of these pathways or a combination of inhibiting
these pathways drives efficacy following Notch inhibition. To begin
to address this question, comparative microarray analysis of
RO4929097-treated A549 (sensitive) and H460a (resistant) cells
was initiated. This analysis used two short-term time points of 6
and 24 h post-treatment. It was reasoned that direct effects of
RO4929097 would occur within 24 h of treatment after which
secondary mRNA changes would complicate the analyses. A549
cells treated for 6 h showed changes in gene expression, which fell
into three main categories: transcription factors and repressors,
heat shock protein binding, and vasculature development (Fig. 6A).
Treatment for 24 h expanded these categories to include genes
related to extracellular matrix, cell differentiation, metastasis, and
cell-cell signaling. Specific genes listed in the boxes represent
mRNAs that were altered at both 6 and 24 h. Some of the specific
mRNA changes include three well-known Notch-regulated tran-

scription factors Hes1, Hes4, and Hey1, the expression of which was
reduced after RO4929097 treatment. Several genes were induced
following RO4929097 treatment including Agr2, Arid5B, Megf9, Ell2,
Gch1, and IL6R. Interestingly, the in vivo nonresponsive H460a cell
line did not show Hes1, Hes4, or Hey1 significant mRNA reduction
and had a very quiet gene expression pattern. A Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis was done using the NextBio software to identify gene sets
having a significant correlation between RO4929097-induced gene
changes and primary tumors. Our analysis used the large data set
derived from a multisite clinical study involving hundreds of NSCLC
patients and highlighted several groups of genes associated with
different stages of NSCLC (22). For example, an overall positive
correlation (P-value = 1.7E-9) was observed between the RO4929097induced gene signature at 24 h and that derived from a comparison
between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated non–small cell
lung adenocarcinomas (Fig. 6B). Overall, the microarray analyses
detected the expression of genes associated with a less transformed
phenotype following RO4929097 treatment.

Discussion
Growing preclinical evidence shows that inactivation of the
Notch pathway by targeting g-secretase may be a viable strategy for

the treatment of cancer (6). RO4929097 was originally developed for
Alzheimer’s disease as a potent inhibitor of g-secretase targeting
APP processing. This article reports the cross-therapeutic
application of RO4929097 to cancer treatment via inhibition of
g-secretase-mediated processing of Notch signaling.
RO4929097 is a potent and selective g-secretase small-molecule
inhibitor targeting the Notch signaling pathway resulting in
decreased ICN production and mRNA expression of the ICN target
gene, Hes1, in tumor cells. Addition of RO4929097 to tumor-derived
cell lines produced a flattened, less transformed phenotype as well
as a reduced capability for soft-agar growth. This is in good
agreement with data from Stylianou and colleagues, which
reported a less transformed phenotype and loss of ability to grow
in soft agar when Notch signaling was inhibited by the overexpression of the Notch negative regulator Numb in breast cancer
cells (23). RO4929097 produced efficacy when dosed orally in 7 of
8 xenograft models. This efficacy was sustained in the absence of
further dosing and was not associated with body weight loss in
mice. The data provided experimental support for proceeding into
clinical development using intermittent dosing, which may allow

www.aacrjournals.org

for recovery in normal tissue from Notch inhibition while
maintaining tumor efficacy. This hypothesis will be tested during
clinical development using a hair follicle pharmacodynamic assay
to monitor Notch inhibition.
An important aspect of oncology clinical development is the
understanding of what factors contribute to efficacy. The role of
Notch in cell fate determination points to three potential drivers of
efficacy in tumors: (a) promoting tumor cell differentiation, (b)
reducing the cancer stem cell tumor subpopulation, and (c)
inhibiting angiogenesis by targeting Notch signaling in tumor
endothelial cells (3–8). A better understanding of this biology will
undoubtedly affect the clinical development of g-secretase
inhibitors.
The effect of Notch signaling in tumor cells is a growing area of
investigation. Notch signaling has been shown to play a role in the
maintenance of tumor stem cells as well as playing a role in
maintaining tumor cells in a less differentiated, highly proliferative
state (1, 6). As an approach to study the mechanism of action of
RO4929097, gene analysis experiments were done on the sensitive
(A549) and resistant (H460a) tumor cell lines. After 6 h of

compound treatment, down-regulation of several transcription
factor mRNAs was observed including Hes1, Hes4, and Hey1 in the
A549 responder cell line in contrast to the H460a nonresponder.
After 24 h of treatment, the list of affected genes expanded to
include mRNAs related to extracellular matrix, cell differentiation,
metastasis, and cell-cell signaling. This is consistent with the
xenograft experiment where collagen type V protein expression was
reduced, whereas MFAP5 protein expression was elevated. Both of
these proteins are components of the extracellular matrix. Collagen
type V expression is often reduced and MFAP5 expression is often
elevated in normal tissues (24–28). MFAP5 is a key component of
microfibrils, which provide elasticity in such tissues as lung and
skin. In addition to the role in elastic fibers, MFAP5 participates in
Notch signaling through a direct interaction with the Notch
receptor (29). Recent data suggest that MFAP5 antagonizes Notch
signaling, promoting endothelial cell sprouting (30).
Comparing the entire RO4929097-induced gene signature to the
existing public expression data sets in NextBio showed that many
gene changes observed in tumor cell differentiation were also
changed in RO4929097-treated cells. These data are consistent with
the working hypothesis that Notch1 inhibition in A549 tumor cells
leads to a differentiated phenotype (Fig. 6B). It is difficult to assess

the effect of RO4929097 on cancer stem cells in this cell model
system. It is interesting to note that RO4929097 treatment induced
the expression of the interleukin-6 receptor (Fig. 6A). Interleukin-6
supports cancer stem cell renewal in breast cancer mammospheres
via Notch3 (31). The increase in the interleukin-6 receptor
following RO4929097 may represent a regulatory compensation
for the loss of Notch signaling.
Notch signaling and tumor vascularization are the most
compelling aspects of Notch tumor biology to date. Tumor
endothelial cells use Notch signaling in building the tumor
vasculature analogous to the role of Notch in cell fate determination during development (7, 8). The current understanding of
Notch signaling during tumor angiogenesis suggests that the Notch
axis plays a determining role in helping tumor endothelial cells
adopt either a tip or tube phenotype at critical points during
angiogenesis. This cell-cell communication and cell signaling are
carried out in conjunction with vascular endothelial growth factor
signaling to generate and then finely tune the mature vessels. The
molecular analysis of xenografts treated with RO4929097 show
reduced expression of genes associated with angiogenesis,
consistent with the ability of RO4929097 to inhibit tumor
angiogenesis including VE-cadherin (Cdh5), VEGFR1 (FLT1),

VEGFR2 (KDR), MMP9, and CD31 (PECAM1; Fig. 4C). Large
pockets of necrosis are present in xenograft tumors, also consistent
with an antiangiogenic mechanism. These results are similar to
those reported for the Notch1 decoy (32). The in vivo CD31 and VEcadherin expression was reduced and tumor growth was inhibited
in the absence of Notch1 function.
It is important to note that g-secretase is a promiscuous protease
enzyme complex with up to 60 potential substrates in addition to
Notch (33, 34). RO4929097 and other reported g-secretase inhibitors
likely carry additional inhibitory activities that preclude a complete
understanding of Notch tumor biology at this time. Differences in
substrate selectivity can explain some differences in biology
reported for other g-secretase inhibitors such as cell cycle inhibition
(35). Cell context is likely a key determinate of how a cell responds to
Notch inhibition. Interestingly, selective small-molecule inhibitors
targeting APP processing over Notch processing have been reported
and remain an area of great interest in Alzheimer’s disease (36, 37). It
remains to be determined whether RO4929097 inhibits all four Notch
family members and what other substrates might be preferentially
inhibited by RO4929097. A deeper understanding of Notch receptor
selectivity will likely affect clinical development of g-secretase
inhibitors given the potential for different biology within the Notch
receptor family (38).
RO4929097 is currently being tested in a phase I multidose
escalation in patients with solid tumors using several pharmacodynamic readouts including the Hes1 hair follicle assay. As an oral
agent, two schedules are being evaluated to exploit the inherent

www.aacrjournals.org

flexibility of oral dosing and minimize toxicity (39). Preclinical data
suggest that antitumor effects may continue to develop over time
and efficacy may be sustained in the absence of further dosing. How
this can be best exploited in the clinic remains to be determined
especially given the function of Notch signaling in normal tissues.
Targeted inhibition of Notch signaling has the potential to affect
tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell differentiation, and survival of tumor
stem cells. The H460a cell line appears to be refractory to the effects
of RO4929097. A better understanding of the molecular defects
driving the resistance of the H460a cell line may provide a deeper
understanding of the Notch signaling pathway in cancer. This will lay
the research groundwork for a patient selection molecular profile.
Further evaluation of the key drivers of efficacy will provide
important information on the types of tumors responsive to
treatment and appropriate selection of patients who are most likely
to derive clinical benefit from RO4929097.
