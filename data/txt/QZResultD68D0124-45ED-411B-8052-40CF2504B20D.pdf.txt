Sequential Therapy in Renal Cell
Carcinoma*
Bernard Escudier, MD, Marine Gross Goupil, MD, Christophe Massard, MD,
and Karim Fizazi, MD, PhD

Because of the recent approval of several drugs for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (including sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and, in Europe, bevacizumab plus interferon), the use of sequential therapy has
become routine practice. There is now evidence that administering these targeted agents sequentially provides clinical benefit by inducing tumor shrinkage and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in a large
number of patients. However, data regarding overall survival (OS) are still pending. By adding these drugs
in an adequate order, one can expect an increase in overall PFS of up to 27 months and a subsequent
improvement in the OS of patients with renal cell carcinoma. It has been recently reported that the OS of
patients treated with sunitinib in the first-line setting was 26 months. Expecting a survival of 40 months
does appear possible based on currently available data, although this assumption will have to be proven in

KEY WORDS: sequential, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, everolimus.

The approval of several drugs for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has provided
many therapeutic options for this disease. After the approval of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the 1980s (and of
interferon in many countries), subsequent approval (based on data from large, randomized, phase 3 studies) has been given to sorafenib,1 sunitinib,2 and temsirolimus3 in the US and Europe. In addition, bevacizumab in combination with interferon4 was approved in December, 2007 in Europe, and everolimus
(RAD-001) has recently demonstrated activity in patients in whom previous treatment with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has failed, raising the expectation that this drug might be approved in 2009.5
Obviously, the availability of these drugs encourages oncologists but also patients to try each drug
sequentially, at least in those countries in which there is access to these agents. This review will provide
available data regarding sequential therapy and will attempt to draw hypotheses for the future therapy of
RCC. Although there is evidence that sequential therapy can provide some benefit in terms of disease
control and tumor shrinkage, to our knowledge, a survival benefit has not yet been proven.

Efficacy of Targeted Agents After
Cytokine Therapy
Two randomized studies have demonstrated the efficacy
of targeted agents versus placebo in patients with cytokine–refractory disease. Bevacizumab was first shown to
be active in patients in whom high-dose IL-2 treatment
had failed. In this randomized phase 2 trial,6 116 patients
were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: placebo (n ¼
40 patients), 3 mg/kg of bevacizumab (n ¼ 37 patients),
or 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab (n ¼ 39 patients). Data from
this trial demonstrated that the median time to disease
progression was significantly longer for the patients
treated with 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab than placebo (4.8
months vs 2.5 months; hazards ratio [HR], 2.55 [P
<.001]). The median time to disease progression for the
patients receiving 3 mg/kg of bevacizumab was 3.0
months and was not significantly greater than that of
patients on the placebo arm (HR, 1.26; P ¼ .053). Four
patients (10%) treated on the 10-mg/kg treatment arm
achieved partial responses, which were of variable duration (6 months, 9 months, 15 months, and >39 months,
respectively). No patients on the 3-mg/kg treatment arm
achieved a partial response. Overall survival (OS) was not
found to be significantly different among the 3 treatment
arms (P >.20 for all comparisons), which could be due to
the crossover of the placebo patients.
Sorafenib also demonstrated activity in a large,
randomized, phase 3 trial.1 In this 903-patient study,
patients were randomized to receive either sorafenib (at a
dose of 400 mg administered twice daily) or placebo. Tumor shrinkage was observed in the majority of patients,
and progression-free survival (PFS) significantly improved
from 3 months to 6 months (P <.0001). Final OS was
reported in 2007.7 Although the OS was found to be similar between the 2 treatment arms (17.8 months vs 15.2
months; P ¼ .15), there was a suggestion of a preplanned
analysis demonstrating improved survival with sorafenib
after the censoring of placebo patients who crossed over to
the sorafenib arm (17.8 months vs 14.3 months; P ¼ .03).
Several other targeted agents also demonstrated activity in patients with cytokine–refractory disease. Sunitinib has the strongest evidence of activity outside of
randomized phase 3 trials; in 2 consecutive phase 2 studies, for a total of 160 RCC patients with metastatic RCC
who failed first-line, cytokine-based therapy, the response
rate was approximately 40%, with a median PFS of 8

months and an OS of approximately 16 months.8,9 Axitinib, another TKI, also demonstrated impressive activity
in a 52-patient, phase 2 study in patients with cytokine–
refractory RCC, with a 44% objective response rate and a
median time to disease progression of 15.7 months.10
Finally, in an initial randomized phase 2 study designed
to determine the best dose for further phase 3 studies,
temsirolimus was found to result in a 5.8-month PFS,
mainly in patients in whom first-line therapy with cytokines had failed.11
Thus, all currently tested targeted agents have activity after cytokines. Although the magnitude of PFS (Table
1) appears to be different between agents (ranging from
4.8 months–15.7 months), these numbers should be
viewed with caution because the trial designs and the
selected populations might bias them considerably.1,6,8-11
Conversely, the efficacy of cytokines after targeted
agents remains unknown, although toxicity might
increase in this setting as reported for IL-2 after targeted
agents.12

Efficacy of TKIs After Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor–directed Therapy
To our knowledge, no randomized study has assessed the
efficacy of TKIs after either bevacizumab or TKIs. However, several prospective studies and a few retrospective
analyses of patients treated sequentially with TKIs support
the finding that there is no absolute cross-resistance
among those drugs that target vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF).
Sunitinib has demonstrated activity in patients who
had been previously treated with bevacizumab and subsequently experienced disease progression.13 That study

evaluated the utility of sunitinib, at a classic dose of 50
mg/day for 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off, in 61 patients
who received at least 4 doses of bevacizumab and demonstrated Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST)–defined progression of disease during or
within 3 months of bevacizumab-based treatment. The
best response reported was 23% of patients achieving a
partial response and 74% of patients overall demonstrating some degree of tumor shrinkage.13 The median PFS
was 29.7 weeks. Three patients achieved a partial response
with both agents, whereas other patients achieved a partial
response only with bevacizumab (n ¼ 2 patients) or sunitinib (n ¼ 11 patients), without an objective response to
the other agent.13
Axitinib has demonstrated promising efficacy in
patients with disease that is refractory to sorafenib.14 In a
phase 2 study, 62 patients received axitinib at a daily dose of
5 mg, with a partial response rate of 21% and a PFS of 7.4
months reported.14 It is interesting to note that, in this
study, the patients could have received other therapies,
including sunitinib and bevacizumab, before sorafenib was
administered. It was discovered that many patients received
sorafenib in the third-line setting or later, outlining the
promising efficacy of axitinib in RCC.14
Finally, several reports of retrospective analyses of
patients sequentially treated with sorafenib and sunitinib or
vice versa have been published to date.15-17 What to our
knowledge is the largest study reported to date, consisting
of 90 consecutive patients,15 was reported recently. In this
study, 68 patients received sorafenib followed by sunitinib,
whereas 22 patients received the reverse sequence. Benefit
was observed in both groups with the second TKI, with
tumor shrinkage and partial responses reported in some
patients. The PFS times were 25 weeks and 17 weeks,
respectively for sunitinib and sorafenib given as the second
TKI, with an overall median duration of combined therapy
of 61 weeks and 49 weeks, respectively, for the sorafenibsunitinib and sunitinib-sorafenib sequences.

Efficacy of mTOR Inhibitors After TKIs
Until recently, no data have been available regarding the
use of mTOR inhibitors after TKI therapy. Recently,

that progressed 6 months after VEGF receptor
(VEGFR)–TKI therapy (sorafenib, sunitinib, or both)
were randomized 2:1 to treatment with everolimus (10
mg/day orally) or placebo, both of which were administered with best supportive care. Patients were stratified by
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk criteria and
prior VEGFR-TKI therapy (1 vs 2 regimens). The primary endpoint was PFS, which was documented using
RECIST and assessed via blinded, independent review. At
the time of disease progression, treatment was unblinded,
and patients receiving placebo were offered open-label
everolimus. A total of 272 patients were randomized to
receive everolimus and 138 were randomized to receive
placebo. The PFS was 4 months versus 1.9 months
according to the independent review, leading to a significant improvement (HR, 0.31; P <.001). This benefit was
observed in all TKI groups: sunitinib alone (46%), sorafenib alone (28%), or both TKIs (26%). In addition, tumor
shrinkage was observed in 60% of patients versus 10%
with everolimus therapy compared with placebo.
The efficacy of everolimus in combination with bevacizumab after TKI has also been recently reported.18 In a
phase 2 study, 59 patients received this combination therapy, 29 of whom had been previously treated with sunitinib or sorafenib. PFS in this patient population was 10
months, suggesting the synergistic activity of both agents
in patients with TKI–refractory disease.

Speculations and Suggestions for the
Sequential Treatment of RCC
To our knowledge, the data reported herein are currently
the only available data to support sequential therapy in
RCC. Data are not available for either bevacizumab or
temsirolimus after TKIs, nor for the administration of
mTOR inhibitors after another mTOR inhibitor. Thus,
deciding which is the best sequence to use in patients with
RCC remains hypothetical.
An attempt to speculate based on the data was made
in Table 2. In this table, the calculation was made by adding the PFS obtained from reported studies to provide an
expected PFS in patients able to receive all the active drugs
sequentially (which is obviously biased). Although not
scientifically valid, the findings in Table 2 suggest that
one could obtain an ‘‘overall PFS’’ ranging from approximately 20 months to 27 months by sequential

therapy.1,2,4,10,12-15 Based on recent reports that sunitinib
(with a median PFS of 11 months2) induced an OS of 26
months19 whereas interferon (with a median PFS of 5
months) provided a median OS of 15 months, one can
expect that, with a total PFS of approximately 27 months
using the best sequential therapy, the survival of patients
with RCC might increase up to 40 months in the near
future. We recognize that this is pure speculation. However, this speculation raises interesting hypotheses for
future clinical trials.
In conclusion, there is evidence that sequential therapy in RCC is beneficial to patients and ultimately should
provide a survival advantage. This hypothesis should now
be demonstrated by prospective, well–designed trials.
Therefore, future trials should focus on the efficacy of 1
sequence compared with another. Some interesting proposals are currently under evaluation, such as the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center ‘‘START’’
proposal. In this proposal, RCC patients are randomized
at the time of first–line therapy between bevacizumab,
sunitinib, or temsirolimus; after disease progression, the
same patients are subsequently randomized between the 2
remaining drugs (patients first treated with bevacizumab
are randomized between sunitinib and temsirolimus, etc).
Another proposal comparing everolimus followed by
sunitinib with sunitinib followed by everolimus will raise
another sequential question.
Finally, it is likely that a better understanding of the
mechanisms underlying efficacy but also resistance to
these targeted agents will help in the future. As an example, the evidence that hypoxia–inducible factor expression
into the tumor is strongly associated with response to
2324

sunitinib20 suggests that the biology of the tumor will be
important for selecting the best agent with which to initiate treatment.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
correspond directly to the written article, which is a more
general review.
Dr. Michael Atkins: Did patients with prior sunitinib therapy who demonstrated activity with sorafenib not
tolerate sunitinib or not have progressive disease?
Dr. Bernard Escudier: The best response to sunitinib was progressive disease. I would not consider using
sorafenib in patients who had progressive disease while
taking sunitinib.
Dr. Brian Rini: In our trial of sorafenib after sunitinib, we did not see an association between response to the
first therapy and response to the second therapy. Obviously, if someone blows through their first line of therapy,
they may not be in good shape to do well with other
agents, but I do not think that lack of response on sunitinib precluded lack of tumor shrinkage with sorafenib.
Dr. Escudier: When we don’t have at least stable
disease as best response, efficacy of sorafenib has not been
seen in our experience.
Dr. Robert Figlin: I am not yet clear on how to
design trials where you have the potential for sequential
therapy leading to an overall survival of almost 3.5 years
where responses sometimes can be modest. ProgressionCancer

free survival requires randomized trials but the industry
does not want to compare their drugs to each other. I
worry that in 5 years we will have more information but
no clear path to the top.
Dr. Escudier: I want to have a combination trial
with complete remission rate as a primary endpoint.
Dr. Figlin: Are there laboratory-based questions
that will help us determine what we need to be thinking
about in the clinic in terms of generating resistance in the
clinic and then adding other agents?
Dr. William Kaelin: We are continuing to try to
identify additional targets that make sense because either
they are on the HIF pathway or they are synthetic lethal to
VHL. However, I do not know of a reason in the laboratory why the mTOR inhibitors should not have an additive effect with the VEGF inhibitors. Despite this, I am
sensing some pessimism from the community about
whether mTOR inhibitors and VEGF inhibitors are
going to be better than monotherapy.
Dr. Atkins: Let us say we had a combination in the
BeSt trial that was better than bevacizumab. One question
would be whether that combination would be better than
sequential therapy.
Dr. Kaelin: Maybe we need a new paradigm, such as
sequential rather than combinations. On the other hand,
combinations are important for those forms of cancer we
can cure with chemotherapy. Maybe for epithelial cancers
like kidney cancer, we will need 3 or more active drugs.
Dr. Figlin: If you had 3 or 4 drugs, all of which produced partial remissions and none of which produced
complete remissions, you still couldn’t cure anyone. The
reason you cure people with Hodgkin disease and lymphoma is because you produce complete remissions.
