Cell Death

Abstract
BCL2 suppresses apoptosis by binding the BH3 domain of proapoptotic factors and thereby regulating outer
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Many tumor types, including B-cell lymphomas and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, are dependent on BCL2 for survival but become resistant to apoptosis after treatment.
Here, we identiﬁed a direct interaction between the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 and the enzyme PARP1, which
suppresses PARP1 enzymatic activity and inhibits PARP1-dependent DNA repair in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
cells. The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 displaced PARP1 from BCL2 in a dose-dependent manner, reestablishing PARP1
activity and DNA repair and promoting nonapoptotic cell death. This form of cell death was unaffected by
resistance to single-agent ABT-737 that results from upregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. On the
basis of the ability of BCL2 to suppress PARP1 function, we hypothesized that ectopic BCL2 expression would kill
PARP inhibitor–sensitive cells. Strikingly, BCL2 expression reduced the survival of PARP inhibitor–sensitive
breast cancer and lung cancer cells by 90% to 100%, and these effects were reversed by ABT-737. Taken together,
our ﬁndings show that a novel interaction between BCL2 and PARP1 blocks PARP1 enzymatic activity and
suppresses PARP1-dependent repair. Targeted disruption of the BCL2–PARP1 interaction therefore may
represent a potential therapeutic approach for BCL2-expressing tumors resistant to apoptosis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Many tumors harbor genetic, epigenetic, or posttranscriptional alterations that result in overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (1–3). In these tumors, BCL2 inhibits
apoptosis from a number of stresses, including DNA damage,
microtubule perturbation, and oncogene activation (4), by
binding the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology-3) domain of proapoptotic
factors. Small molecules that occupy the BH3-binding pocket
of BCL2, such as ABT-737 (5), are under development for the
treatment of malignancies dependent on BCL2 (6, 7). These
agents function by disrupting the interaction between BCL2
and proapoptotic BH3 domain–containing proteins, such as
BIM. Upon displacement, certain proapoptotic proteins can
initiate oligomerization of the apoptosis effector proteins BAX
and BAK.

Cells can overcome dependence on BCL2 in 3 ways (8). First,
they can upregulate other antiapoptotic factors through cellautonomous or non–cell-autonomous processes. For example,
long-term selection of BCL2-overexpressing diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) cells in the presence of ABT-737 promotes
resistance through upregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL2
family members MCL1 and/or BFL1 (9). Second, cells can
downregulate proapoptotic signaling through changes in
either gene expression or posttranslational modiﬁcations.
Third, cells can lose BAX and/or BAK and thereby become
incapable of orchestrating intrinsic apoptosis. Each of these
mechanisms can confer broad resistance to apoptosis induced
by various stimuli, including DNA-damaging agents and microtubule binders (10, 11).
Essentially, all cases of follicular lymphoma and many cases
of DLBCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and other
subsets of non–Hodgkin lymphoma depend on BCL2 for
survival (8). In the upfront setting, these diseases are broadly
sensitive to an array of antineoplastic agents. However, relapse
after treatment with one or more therapeutic regimens is
commonly associated with resistance to multiple classes of
chemotherapy as a consequence of epigenetic, genetic, and/or
posttranslational modiﬁcations in the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis. Even in cells lacking autonomous resistance to
apoptosis, bone marrow and lymphoid node stroma provide
attachment sites and surface bound growth factors as survival
signals that reduce the apoptotic response to a broad range of
chemotherapies (12, 13).

Dutta et al.

Novel approaches are clearly needed for inducing death in
tumor cells with resistance to apoptosis. Here, we identify a
novel mechanism for target nonapoptotic cell death that is
dependent on PARP1 and suppressed by BCL2.

Materials and Methods
These studies were approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (DFCI; Boston, MA) Institutional Review Board. All P
values were calculated by 2-sided t test using GraphPad
software. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary
Methods.
Cell culture and reagents
HT, Toledo, and OCI-LY8 were provided by Margaret Shipp.
1OCI-Ly1-7R, OCI-Ly1-10R, 1863, and 3256 were previously
described (14, 15). Cell lines were not authenticated before
these studies. N-Methyl-N 0 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG),
etoposide, and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma.
BCL2-DKO cells were generated from a pool of DKO cells
transfected with pcDNA3.1-BCL2 and selected in 1 mg/mL
G418 (Gold Biotechnology). ABT-737 and ABT-888 were kindly
supplied by Abbott Laboratories.
Cell death assay
Cells were treated with 500 mmol/L MNNG for 15 minutes,
washed with media, and cultured for 16 hours with dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), 100 nmol/L ABT-737, 100 nmol/L ABT-888,
or combination. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI;
1 mg/mL; Roche) and Annexin V-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC; Upstate), and ﬂow cytometry was conducted on a
FACSCanto II (BD BioSciences) at the DFCI Division of Hematologic Neoplasia FACS Core Facility.
Determination of NAD and ATP concentrations
Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were treated 30 minutes with 500 mmol/L MNNG in the presence of ABT-737, ABT888, DMSO, or combinations. MTT (Sigma) and CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) were used to
determine cellular NAD and ATP, respectively, using SoftMax
Pro5.
ELISA
Increasing concentrations of puriﬁed glutathione Stransferase (GST)-BCL2 were added to fractionated lysates
from HT cells. Similarly, increasing concentrations of ABT-737
were added to fractionated lysates from OCI-Ly1-10R. The
protein concentration of each fraction was measured using
the bicinchoninic acid method (Thermo-Fisher). PARP1 enzymatic activity on immobilized histones was measured using
an ELISA (Trevigen).
Comet assay
OCI-LY1-10R cells were treated with 50 mmol/L MNNG for
15 minutes. Cells were collected before MNNG treatment (pre),
immediately after washing out MNNG (post-MNNG), or after
washing followed by 3-hour treatment with DMSO, ABT-888
(100 nmol/L), or ABT-737 (100 nmol/L). Cells were subjected to
the alkaline comet assay (Trevigen).

Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at
room temperature and permeabilized for 10 minutes in 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS containing 0.25% Triton X100. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.02% Triton X-100
and incubated with antibodies diluted in 2.5% BSA/PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight. Images were captured on
a Zeiss Axio Observer.A1 ﬂuorescence microscope. Confocal
images were captured on a Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal
microscope and analyzed using ImageJ software.
Primary CLL cell culture
The day before the experiment, 5  104 human stromal cells
per well were seeded onto 48-well plates. CLL cells were
collected from peripheral blood, isolated by Ficoll separation,
and viably frozen in liquid nitrogen. On the day of the experiment, the CLL cells were thawed and added to the stromal
culture at 20:1 ratio. For comparison, CLL cells were also
cultured in suspension at 3  106 cells/mL. For assessment
of stroma-derived resistance, 50 mmol/L MNNG, 100 nmol/L
ABT-737, and/or 200 nmol/L ABT-888 were added 24 hours
later. At the indicated time points, CLL cells were collected by
gently pipetting off the CLL cells. After appropriate treatments,
cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS
containing 1% FBS and FcR blocking reagent. Cells were
stained with paciﬁc blue-CD19 and APC-CXCR4 antibody to
differentiate B cells from stromal cells. Cells were resuspended
in 50 mL of Annexin-binding buffer and stained with Annexin
V-FITC and PI. Cell numbers were quantiﬁed after the addition
of 2,500 Fluoresbrite-counting beads (Polyscience) per sample.
Mitochondrial sensitivity was determined by BH3 proﬁling, as
described (11).
BCL2 transduction colony assay
Cells were plated in 6-well plates (1,000 cells per well) the day
before the retroviral infection. The cells were transduced and
24 hours later and were selected in 1 mg/mL G418 (Gold
Biotechnology). After 24 hours, cells were washed and incubated in the presence or absence of ABT-737. Cells were ﬁxed in
methanol for 1 hour and stained with Giemsa.

Results
Overexpressed BCL2 localizes in the nucleus of lymphoid
tumor cells
Multiple previous studies have identiﬁed BCL2 within the
nucleus of tumor cell lines and ﬁbroblasts with high levels of
BCL2 expression (16–19). We ﬁrst examined BCL2 localization
in the DLBCL cell lines OCI-LY1, OCI-LY8, and Toledo. All
3 lines harbor translocation t(14;18), which results in expression of BCL2 under IGH transcriptional control. Immunoblotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions showed BCL2 within
the nucleus of all 3 cell lines in the presence or absence of
MNNG, ionizing radiation (IR), or ABT-737 (Fig. 1A). Immunoﬂuorescence of OCI-LY8 cells conﬁrmed the nuclear localization of BCL2 (Supplementary Fig. S1). BCL2 also localized to
the nucleus in 2 murine B lineage leukemia lines that overexpress BCL2 and MYC (15).

Figure 1. Nuclear BCL2 interacts with PARP1. A, nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions from Em-MYC/MMTV-BCL2 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias
(1863 and 3256; ref. 15) were immunoblotted for BCL2, tubulin (cytoplasmic marker), and histone H3 (nuclear marker). DLBCL lines were analyzed by
immunoblotting 1 hour after irradiation or treatment with MNNG in the presence or absence of ABT-737. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression
plasmid for HA-BCL2, and fractionated lysates were collected after 24 hours. C, OCI-LY8 cells were exposed to IR. After 30 minutes, whole-cell lysates (WCL)
or subcellular fractions were isolated and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-BCL2 antibody followed by separation on SDS-PAGE gel and
Coomassie staining. Mass spectrometry of the approximately 113-kDa band (top arrow) revealed multiple peptides from PARP1. Mass spectrometry
of the lower 2 bands indicated by arrows identiﬁed multiple histones. D, OCI-LY8 cells were irradiated and then treated with vehicle (DMSO), ABT-737 (737), an
ABT-737 enantiomer (enant), or ABT-888 (888). Subcellular fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-BCL2 antibody and immunoblotted for BCL2,
PARP1, or KU70. Loading and fractionation were conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Input). E, immunoblotting against PAR in the presence or absence
of 100 mmol/L MNNG, 100 nmol/L ABT-888, the combination, or 100 nmol/L ABT-737.

To determine whether ectopically expressed BCL2 can localize to the nucleus, we transfected hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged
BCL2 into 293T cells. Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody
on cellular fractions revealed that BCL2 was present in the
nucleoplasm before and after irradiation (Fig. 1B). Irradiation
also promoted the recruitment of BCL2 to chromatin (Fig. 1B).
Even with ectopic expression, the nuclear and cytoplasmic
levels of BCL2 remained lower than those observed in OCI-LY1
and OCI-LY8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
BCL2 and PARP1 interact in DLBCL cells
Localization of BCL2 to irradiated chromatin suggested that
BCL2 interacts with one or more factors involved in the DNA
damage response. To identify proteins in the chromatin fraction that interact with BCL2, we isolated the chromatin fractions from OCI-LY8 cells after irradiation and conducted
immunoprecipitation with an anti-BCL2 antibody (Fig. 1C).
Mass spectrometry of a 113-kDa band present only in the
irradiated chromatin fraction (Fig. 1C) identiﬁed 18 distinct
peptides from PARP1 with greater than 99% conﬁdence (Supplementary Table S1).

www.aacrjournals.org

PARP1 plays a role in several nuclear processes, including
base excision repair, transcription regulation, DNA methylation, and chromatin modeling (20). PARP1 responds to DNA
damage by using NADþ to transfer PAR to acceptor proteins,
including histones and PARP1 itself.
The BCL2–PARP1 interaction is disrupted by ABT-737
To determine whether the BCL2–PARP1 interaction
involves the BH3-binding groove of BCL2, we exposed OCILY8 cells to irradiation followed by a 30-minute treatment with
DMSO, 100 nmol/L ABT-737 or 100 nmol/L of an inactive ABT737 enantiomer (5). ABT-737 displaced approximately 65% of
PARP1 from BCL2 whereas the enantiomer had no effect (Fig.
1D). ABT-737 had little or no effect compared with its inactive
enantiomer on the interaction between BCL2 and the nonhomologous end-joining protein KU70 (Fig. 1D), which does not
bind within the BH3-binding groove (18).
PARP1 undergoes auto-PARylation in response to DNA
damage. This creates a negatively charged scaffold that can
mediate nonspeciﬁc protein interactions. Thus, the BCL2–
PARP1 interaction could involve PAR, rather than PARP1 itself.

Figure 2. ABT-737 disrupts the BCL2–PARP1 interaction. A, puriﬁed PARP1 was incubated with GST-tagged BCL2, GST-BCL-xL, or GST-BCL-w. Mixtures
were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-GST antibody followed by immunoblotting (IB) for PARP1. Ponceau staining was conducted on
immunoprecipitates to conﬁrm equal recovery. B, ﬂuorescence polarization assay of GST-BCL2 mixed with increasing concentrations of ABT-737, NOXA, or
PARP1, as previously described (22). Error bars indicate SEM. C, GST-BCL2 and PARP1 were incubated along with increasing concentrations of ABT-737.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were conducted as in A. D, schematic representation of full-length PARP1, deletion constructs, and brct domain
constructs. F1 and F2 are zinc ﬁnger 1 and zinc ﬁnger 2 domains, respectively. N indicates the nuclear localization signal. E, bacterially expressed PARP1
proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with anti-PARP1 antibody. Arrows indicate the expected sizes. F, His-PARP1
constructs were incubated with puriﬁed GST-BCL2 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-His antibody and immunoblotting against BCL2. Puriﬁed GSTBCL2 was used as a control for BCL2 immunoblotting. Incubation of the His-DBRCT and GST-BCL2 was conducted in the presence or absence of
100 nmol/L ABT-737. G, GST-BCL2 was incubated with brct-only or brctDBH3 constructs followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with an
antibody speciﬁc for the PARP1 BRCT domain. Ponceau staining was conducted to conﬁrm equal loading. WB, Western blotting.

Treatment with the PARP1 inhibitor ABT-888 (21) completely
blocked MNNG-induced PARylation (Fig. 1E) but had no effect
on the BCL2–PARP1 interaction (Fig. 1D), indicating that the
interaction with BCL2 is independent of PAR.
BCL2 interacts directly with PARP1 in vitro
To clarify whether PARP1 interacts with BCL2 directly or via
intermediary proteins, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation
on a mixture of puriﬁed PARP1 and GST-tagged BCL2. In the
absence of DNA and NADþ, glutathione (GSH) beads coated
with GST-BCL2 recovered PARP1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no
PARP1 was recovered when GSH beads were coated with either
GST-BCL-xL or GST-BCL-w (Fig. 2A), 2 BCL2 family members
that are also bound by ABT-737 (5).
We conducted a ﬂuorescence polarization assay, as previously described (22), to conﬁrm the interaction between fulllength PARP1 and BCL2. As expected, full-length ABT-737

4196

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

avidly interacted with BCL2 (Ki, 24.9 nmol/L) whereas the
negative control NOXA failed to interact with BCL2 (Fig. 2B).
Consistent with the ﬁndings by co-immunoprecipitation, fulllength PARP1 interacted with BCL2 (Ki, 77.0 nmol/L; Fig. 2B).
The addition of ABT-737 displaced puriﬁed PARP1 from GSTBCL2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2C), conﬁrming the
ability of ABT-737 to directly disrupt the BCL2-PARP1
interaction.
The PARP1 BRCT domain is required for interaction
with BCL2
Full-length PARP1 includes an N-terminal DNA-binding
domain, a C-terminal catalytic domain, and central PADR,
BRCT, and WGR domains (Fig. 2D). To map the region that
interacts with BCL2, we generated His-tagged C-terminal
deletion mutants of PARP1 (Fig. 2D). Immunoblot analysis
with antibody to PARP1 conﬁrmed all protein products

Figure 3. BCL2 suppresses PARP1 enzymatic function. A, puriﬁed GSTBCL2 was added to fractionated lysates from HT cells or ABT-737 was
added to fractionated lysates from OCI-LY8 cells. PARP1 activity on
immobilized histones was measured by ELISA. Error bars represent SEM.
B, GST-MCL1, GST-BCL-xL, and GST-BCL-w were added to
nucleoplasm extracts from HT cells and PARP1 activity was assayed, as
above. C, OCI-LY1-10R cells treated with MNNG for 15 minutes were
washed and exposed to vehicle (DMSO), ABT-888, or ABT-737. Cells
were collected before MNNG treatment (pre), immediately after washing
MNNG (post-MNNG), or 3 hours after wash. Olive moments were
quantiﬁed for 500 cells in each category. Error bars indicate SEM.
Pictures are 100 magniﬁcation.

(Fig.2E). We mixed equimolar amounts of each His-PARP1
protein with BCL2 and conducted co-immunoprecipitation.
Western blot analysis of BCL2 in eluted His-tagged protein
complex revealed that a C-terminal deletion mutant lacking
the BRCT domain did not interact with BCL2 (Fig. 2F).
To conﬁrm the involvement of the BRCT domain, we
generated an internal BRCT domain deletion mutant (DBRCT),
which also had markedly reduced binding of BCL2 (Fig. 2F). To
determine whether the PARP1 BRCT domain alone can bind
BCL2, we generated a 15-kDa fragment that contains the
PARP1 BRCT domain (Fig. 2D). After mixing with GSH beads
coated with GST-BCL2, immunoblotting with an antibody
speciﬁc for the PARP1 BRCT domain showed that the BRCT
domain alone is sufﬁcient to bind BCL2 (Fig. 2G). The PARP1
BRCT domain contains a single BH3 motif (LXXXXD) beginning at codon 401. Mutation of both L410 and D406 to alanines
markedly reduced binding of BCL2 (Fig. 2G).
BCL2 blocks PARP1 enzymatic activity in DLBCL cells
To determine whether the BCL2–PARP1 interaction affects
PARP1 function, we measured in vitro PARylation of immobilized histones within cell lysates from the DLBCL cell line HT,
which lacks signiﬁcant BCL2 expression (11). Addition of
puriﬁed BCL2 reduced PARP1 activity in the nucleoplasm and
chromatin fractions of HT cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, addition

www.aacrjournals.org

of MCL1, BCL-xL, or BCL-w had no effect on PARP1 activity
(Fig. 3B). These results are similar to a previous report in HL60
and U937 cells, in which ectopic overexpression of BCL2
suppressed both basal PARP1 activity and the PARP1 response
to a topoisomerase II inhibitor (23).
To determine whether ABT-737 can increase PARP1 activity
by displacing BCL2 from PARP1, we measured the effect of
ABT-737 on PARP1 activity in fractionated lysates from OCILY8 cells. ABT-737 potentiated PARP1 enzymatic activity in a
dose-dependent manner in both nucleoplasm and chromatin
fractions (Fig. 3A). Together, these ﬁndings indicate that the
BCL2–PARP1 interaction blocks PARP1 activity, whereas ABT737 can displace PARP1 from BCL2 and restore that activity.
Next, we asked whether inhibition of PARP1 function by
BCL2 suppresses PARP1-dependent DNA repair. Assaying the
effects of BCL2 inhibition on DNA repair is complicated by the
dependence of most BCL2-overexpressing cells on BCL2 for
survival. We used OCI-LY1 and SU-DHL4 clones previously
selected for resistance to ABT-737 by long-term culture in the
presence of the drug (14). These clones maintain BCL2 expression but have also upregulated the antiapoptotic BCL2 family
members MCL1 and/or BFL1 (14).
OCI-LY1-10R cells were treated for 15 minutes with MNNG,
which is known to activate PARP1-dependent DNA repair
(24). After washing away MNNG, the cells were allowed to
repair the damage for 3 hours in the presence of vehicle, ABT888, or ABT-737. We conducted the alkaline comet assay,
which quantiﬁes both single- and double-stranded DNA
breaks. Cells treated with ABT-737 had signiﬁcantly smaller
comet tails, indicating more extensive resolution of MNNGinduced DNA damage than in cells treated with MNNG and
vehicle (Fig. 3C). The addition of ABT-888 did not further
suppress repair, suggesting that most of the PARP1-mediated
repair in these cells is inactive (Fig. 3B). Of note, neither ABT737 nor MNNG affect the nuclear localization of BCL2
(Fig. 1A).
BCL2 blocks PARP1-dependent, nonapoptotic death
in DLBCL cells
PARP1 enzymatic activity is required for a form of nonapoptotic cell death previously termed "parthanatos" (25–27).
This pathway can be induced by ischemia or treatment with
the alkylating agent MNNG, both of which result in DNA
damage that requires PARP1-dependent repair. This form of
cell death does not involve the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, as
wild-type and Bax/Bak/ MEFs have similar sensitivity to
MNNG-induced nonapoptotic death (24, 28).
We hypothesized that inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity by BCL2 would suppress this form of nonapoptotic cell
death. Supporting this hypothesis, previous studies have
reported that BCL2 can inhibit nitric oxide–induced, nonapoptotic cell death of PC12 and HeLa cells (29) as well as
nonapoptotic death of neural cells induced by GSH depletion
(30). We assayed the survival of ABT-737–resistant clones
treated with MNNG, ABT-737, ABT-888, or combinations (Fig.
4A). As expected, very little cell death was observed with singleagent ABT-737 (Fig. 4A). However, ABT-737 signiﬁcantly
increased death induced by MNNG in ABT-737–resistant

Importantly, MNNG þ ABT-737–induced death was partially
reversed by ABT-888, supporting a speciﬁc role for PARP1 (Fig.
4A and B).
Transmission electron microscopy of OCI-LY1-10R and SUDHL4-2R cells treated with MNNG þ ABT-737 showed ultrastructural features of nonapoptotic cell death, including loss of
membrane integrity with preservation of nuclear architecture
(Fig. 4C). These ﬁndings are most consistent with necrotic cell
death. Double-membrane structures characteristic of autophagy were not present. In contrast, treatment with ABT-737
plus the topoisomerase II poison etoposide resulted in features
characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation
and preservation of membrane integrity (Fig. 4C). Thus, ABT737 can promote PARP1-dependent nonapoptotic death in
DLBCL cells.

We treated Bax/Bak/ MEFs (referred to as "DKO cells")
with MNNG and conﬁrmed that nonapoptotic cell death is
independent of BAX and BAK (Fig. 5A and B). DKO cells that
stably overexpress BCL2 ("BCL2-DKO cells") were less sensitive
to MNNG (P < 0.05 compared with DKO cells; Fig. 5A),
consistent with the inhibition of PARP1-dependent cell death
by BCL2. In both lines, MNNG-induced death was completely
blocked by ABT-888 (Fig. 5A). Thus, BCL2 inhibition can
promote at least 2 forms of cell death. The ﬁrst is BAX/
BAK-dependent intrinsic apoptosis, whereas the second
involves PARP1-dependent nonapoptotic death that is independent of BAX and BAK.
PARP1-mediated cell death induced by MNNG is characterized by reductions in cellular NADþ and ATP (24, 28). We
conﬁrmed that both NADþ and ATP concentrations are
signiﬁcantly reduced in DKO cells after 30-minute treatment
with MNNG (Fig. 5C). In DKO cells, reductions in NADþ and

MNNG treatment led to a lesser reduction of ATP levels in
BCL2-DKO cells, consistent with the attenuation of PARP1
activity by BCL2 (Fig. 5C). Unlike DKO cells, ABT-737 reduced
the levels of NADþ and ATP in MNNG-treated BCL2-DKO cells

HMSCs had signiﬁcant resistance to 100 nmol/L ABT-737 (P <
0.01; Fig. 6C and D). In contrast, coculture with HMSCs did not
block the additive killing from the combination of 50 mmol/L
MNNG plus 100 nmol/L ABT-737 but killing was reduced by
ABT-888 (P < 0.05; Fig. 6C and D), showing partial dependence
on PARP1. Of note, 100 nmol/L ABT-737 plus 50 mmol/L MNNG
resulted in only 20% loss of viability among the HMSC cells
(data not shown).

ABT-737 promotes nonapoptotic death in primary
CLL cells independent of stromal protection
We hypothesized that nonapoptotic cell death induced by
MNNG þ ABT-737 could be used to overcome stroma-induced
resistance to apoptosis. CLL cells are known to be dependent
on BCL2 and sensitive to treatment with ABT-737 (31). Coculture of primary CLL cells with murine or human marrow
stromal cells (HMSC) reduces apoptosis of CLL cells upon
treatment with antineoplastic agents or ABT-737 through
upregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members (12, 13).
We cultured primary CLL cells from 14 patients (Supplementary Table S2) with or without HMSCs for 48 hours (Fig. 6).
As expected, cells cultured in the presence of human HMSCs
downregulated CXCR4 (Fig. 6A), the CLL cell surface homing
receptor for SDF-1/CXCR12 (12, 32). ABT-737 potently induced
mitochondrial depolarization in primary CLL cells cultured in

BCL2 expression induces death in PARP inhibitor–
sensitive cells
A logical extension of our ﬁndings that BCL2 overexpression
phenocopies PARP1 inhibition is that cells sensitive to therapeutic PARP inhibitors could be killed by overexpression of
BCL2. As a proof-of-principle, we retrovirally transduced BCL2
into the BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436
(33). Strikingly, ectopic expression of BCL2 completely blocked
colony formation, which was partially reversed by co-administration of ABT-737 (Fig. 7A).
To expand this ﬁnding, we screened approximately 30 lung
cancer cell lines for sensitivity to the PARP1 inhibitor
AG014699. The lung cancer cell lines H520 (GI50, 30 nmol/L)
and HCC827 (GI50, 65 nmol/L) were highly sensitive to
AG014699, compared with insensitive lines such as H1299
(GI50, >1 mmol/L; Fig. 7B; Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar to

MDA-MB-436 cells, ectopic expression of BCL2 in the PARP
inhibitor–sensitive cell lines reduced colony formation by 90%
to 100% but did not affect colony formation in H1290 cells (Fig.
7C). The effect from BCL2 was reversed by ABT-737 at therapeutic concentrations (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
BCL2 suppresses the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by
binding proapoptotic BCL2 family members (8). We have
identiﬁed 2 additional pathways that can modulate survival
through BCL2. First, inhibition of PARP1 activity by BCL2
delays the repair of DNA damage as well as nonapoptotic cell
death. The pharmacologic BH3 mimetic ABT-737, which was
designed to induce BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in cells
dependent on BCL2 (5), can also promote PARP1-dependent
nonapoptotic death by dissociating PARP1 from BCL2 and
thereby restoring PARP1 enzymatic activity.
The second new pathway of survival modulation involving
BCL2 results from the ability of BCL2 overexpression to
phenocopy PARP deﬁciency. More speciﬁcally, BCL2 overexpression in PARP inhibitor–sensitive cells can promote cell
death, and this death can be reversed by interrupting the
interaction between BCL2 and PARP1. The "pro-death" effect

4200

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

from BCL2 and the "pro-survival" effect from ABT-737 are
speciﬁc to cells that lack the ability to repair damage that
results from PARP deﬁciency. In this model (Fig. 7D), basal
levels of damage are repaired through PARP1 without drastically affecting cellular energy stores. PARP1 deﬁciency, either
through interaction with BCL2 or pharmacologic inhibition,
results in the conversion of single-strand lesions to doublestrand breaks, which can be repaired by homology-directed
repair (HDR; refs. 34, 35). Extensive DNA damage resulting
from exogenous clastogens can drive both apoptosis and
PARP1-mediated nonapoptotic cell death, which are both
suppressed by BCL2.
The extent of damage necessary to induce PARP1-mediated
nonapoptotic death within any particular cell is likely to
depend on several factors, including energy metabolism, repair
efﬁciency, threshold for undergoing apoptosis (36), and the
downstream effectors of PARP1-dependent death. One testable
prediction based on our ﬁndings is that tumors with BCL2
overexpression must maintain some extent of HDR, as concurrent deﬁciencies in HDR and PARP1 result in synthetic
lethality (34, 35). Challenging our model, overexpression of
BCL2 or BCL-xL can suppress HDR in rodent (37) and human
(38, 39) cells. In addition, BCL2 inhibits the formation of

Figure 7. Model for PARP1 involvement in DNA repair and cell death. A, MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells were transduced with BCL2 or control virus and
selected in neomycin in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of ABT-737. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. B, sensitivity of lung
cancer cell lines to the PARP1 inhibitor AG014699. A replicate experiment is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. C, lung cancer cells were transduced
and selected, as in A. Representative data of 3 independent experiments are shown. D, basal DNA damage from endogenous processes such as replication
requires PARP1 for repair. In the absence of functional PARP1, single-strand lesions can become double-strand breaks that require HDR for resolution.
In cells with impaired HDR, the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks induces apoptosis. Similarly, extensive DNA damage from irradiation or
treatment with alkylating agents can induce apoptosis, which is suppressed by BCL2. The same DNA damage can initiate repair and nonapoptotic cell death
dependent on PARP1. The latter pathway is also suppressed by BCL2.

radiation-induced BRCA1 foci in human lymphoma cells (39),
further suggesting that BCL2 may negatively modulate HDR.
However, another study in human lymphoblastoid cells noted
the opposite effect, with a 3-fold increase in HDR upon BCL-xL
overexpression (40).
A series of studies have reported additional effects of BCL2 in
various cell types on other DNA pathways, including nucleotide
excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, and
homologous recombination (16–19, 37, 38, 41–43). The
described effects from BCL2 include both direct binding and
decreased transcription of DNA repair factors. The extent to
which these effects are present within lymphoid tumor cells
and their contribution to sustaining DNA damage after treatment with clastogens have not been addressed.
Several aspects of the BCL2-mediated suppression of PARP1
activity remain unclear. First, the precise function of the PARP1
BRCT domain is poorly understood. In chicken DT40 cells, the
PARP1 BRCT domain appears to be involved in mutagenic
repair at immunoglobulin loci, possibly through an interaction
with nonhomologous end-joining factors (44, 45). Aberrant
somatic hypermutation at oncogene loci is a common feature

www.aacrjournals.org

of lymphomas with BCL2 overexpression (46). Thus, it is
intriguing to speculate that BCL2-mediated suppression of
PARP1 function could promote these events by inhibiting more
ﬁdelitous repair.
It also remains unclear whether targeting nonapoptotic
death would offer an adequate therapeutic index, as some
populations of nonneoplastic cells may be similarly sensitive to
PARP1-mediated death. Zong and colleagues identiﬁed greater
sensitivity to MNNG-induced death in proliferating versus
vegetative cells, despite equivalent amounts of DNA damage
and PARP activity (47). The greater sensitivity among proliferating cells resulted from dependence on glycolysis for the
generation of ATP (i.e., the Warburg effect).
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed a novel interaction
between BCL2 and PARP1 that blocks PARP1 enzymatic
activity and suppresses PARP1-dependent repair. Targeting
of the BCL2–PARP1 interaction with BH3 mimetics is a potential approach for killing BCL2-expressing tumors that are
resistant to apoptosis, either through upregulation of other
antiapoptotic BCL2 family members or from defects in the
intrinsic pathway (11, 13).
