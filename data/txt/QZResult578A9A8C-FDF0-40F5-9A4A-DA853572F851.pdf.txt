ABSTRACT
Fucoidan, a polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds, reduces tumor
cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that fucoidan reduces tumor size
in LLC1-xenograft male C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, we found that LLC1-bearing
mice continuously fed fucoidan showed greater antitumor activity than mice with
discontinuous feeding. Fucoidan inhibited the in vitro growth of lung cancer cells.
Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptors (TGFRs) play important roles in the
regulation of proliferation and progression, and high TGFRI expression in lung cancer
specimens is associated with a worse prognosis. Herein, using lung cancer cells, we
found that fucoidan effectively reduces TGFRI and TGFRII protein levels in vivo and
in vitro. Moreover, fucoidan reduces TGFR downstream signaling events, including
those in Smad2/3 and non-Smad pathways: Akt, Erk1/2, and FAK phosphorylation.
Furthermore, fucoidan suppresses lung cancer cell mobility upon TGFβ stimulation.
To elucidate how fucoidan decreases TGFR proteins in lung cancer cells, we found
that fucoidan enhances the ubiquitination proteasome pathway (UPP)-mediated
degradation of TGFRs in A549 and CL1-5 cells. Mechanistically, fucoidan promotes
Smurf2 and Smad7 to conjugate TGFRs, resulting in TGFR degradation; however,
Smurf2-shRNA abolishes fucoidan-enhanced UPP-mediated TGFR degradation.
Our study is the first to identify a novel mechanism for the antitumor activity of
fucoidan, namely decreasing tumor growth by modulating the TGFR/Smad7/Smurf2dependent axis, leading to TGFR protein degradation and inhibition of lung cancer
cell progression in vitro and in vivo. Our current findings indicate that fucoidan is a
potential therapeutic agent or dietary supplementation for lung cancer, acting via the
Smurf2-dependent ubiquitin degradation of TGFβ receptors.

INTRODUCTION

with NSCLC [16]; indeed, TGFβ1 plays critical and
essential roles in the tumor progression and metastasis of
lung cancers [17, 18]. In addition, TGFβ is described as a
tumor promoter, with the ability to induce the epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [19, 20]. The canonical
signaling events induced by TGFβ1 begin by the binding
of ligands to the TGFβ type II receptor (TGFRII), which
then recruits the TGFβ type I receptor (TGFRI) to form a
complex in which TGFRI is activated [21]. Subsequently,
the activated TGFRI directly phosphorylates Smads,
namely Smad2 and Smad3, which associate with Smad4
and then translocate into the nucleus, regulating the
expression of target genes [22, 23]. In the TGFβ1 noncanonical pathway (the so-called non-Smad pathway), the
activated TGFR complex transmits a signal through other
factors, such as TAK1, PI3K-AKT, ERK, focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), and p38, [24-26], which also mediate tumor
progression, mobility, and metastasis in human lung
adenocarcinoma [27].
TGFR degradation signaling has been reported
to be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
pathways (UPPs) [4, 28]. In general, ubiquitination
controls the turnover of short-lived proteins in a cell.
The ubiquitination process involves the activation of
three specific enzymes, including ubiquitin-activation
enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme (E2),
and ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3) [29], which regulate
ubiquitin molecules to attach to specific target proteins.
Subsequently, these polyubiquitinated target proteins are
disrupted and degraded by the 26S proteasome complex.
The Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2), a
specific C2-WWHECT-domain E3 ligase, participates in
modulating TGFβ-mediated signaling by targeting TGFR
and Smad2. However, Smad7 is one of the key negative
regulators of the TGFβ signaling pathway because Smad7
acts as an adaptor protein to help Smurf2 conjugate
to TGFR, an event that is followed by ubiquitination
processes [30, 31].
In our current study, we demonstrate that fucoidan
inhibits the viability of human NSCLC cells and mouse
lung cancer cells, reduces lung tumorigenesis (tumor
volume and weight), and inhibits TGFRI/II protein
expression in LLC1-xenograft mice orally fed with
fucoidan. Our novel findings suggest that fucoidan
enhances the Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination of TGFR
and consequently TGFR degradation. In parallel,
we demonstrate that fucoidan inhibits TGFβ/TGFR
downstream Smad and non-Smad pathways (FAK, Akt
and Erk) and suppresses cell mobility. Our findings
suggest that fucoidan is a promising therapeutic agent for
the prevention of lung tumorigenesis.

Fucoidan is an aggregate name for algal fucoseenriched sulfated polysaccharides extracted from the
extracellular matrix of brown seaweeds. The structure of
fucoidan principally consists of an α-1,3-backbone or a
repeat unit comprising disaccharides containing α-1,3linked fucose and α-1,4-linked fucose, i.e., α (1→3)- and
α (1→4)-bonded L-fucopyranose residues with additional
branches attached at the C2 positions. The L-fucopyranose
residues may be substituted with a sulfate group (SO3−)
on the C-2 or C-4 (rarely on C-3) position, with single
L-fucosyl residues and/or with short side chains of
fucoside (fuco-oligosaccharide) (Supplemental data,
Scheme A) [1, 2]. The biological activities of fucoidan
have been examined and reported elsewhere [2, 3]; in
particular, the anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and
anti-cancer/anti-tumor activities of fucoidan have recently
drawn considerable attention. We recently reported that
fucoidan inhibits breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in
vivo via the involvement of ubiquitin proteasome pathway
(UPP)-mediated transforming growth factor β receptor
(TGFR) degradation [4]. Fucoidan also induces apoptosis
by the activation of caspase 3 and downregulation of
Erk-mediated pathways [5] as well as by the activation
of caspases 9 and 8, which inhibit the growth of A549
(human lung adenocarcinoma) cells [6] and MCF-7
(human breast cancer) cells [7], respectively. In addition,
fucoidan inhibits invasion and angiogenesis by human
ﬁbrosarcoma cells via repression of the activities of matrix
metalloproteinases 2 and 9 [8].
Lung cancer is among the leading causes of
cancer-related deaths (mortality) in humans worldwide,
accounting for more than 1.3 million deaths each year
[9, 10]. Lung cancer has a higher mortality rate due to
its ability to metastasize early from the lungs to distant
organs. In general, lung cancers can be broadly divided
into two major forms: non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Lung
adenocarcinoma, a subtype of NSCLC, represents the
most common histological type of lung cancer [11]. The
treatment of lung cancer is generally performed using
surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and target
therapy [9]. Although physicians have been dedicated
to improving the treatment and management of lung
cancer, the survival rate of lung cancer remains low. Most
patients with advanced NSCLC will have had their disease
metastasize, and the five-year survival rate is less than
15% [12].
Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) plays a
dual role in cancer biology, in both tumor suppression
and tumor promotion [13]. The over-expression of TGFβ1
promotes tumor growth and aggressive pulmonary
metastasis during the late stages of lung carcinogenesis
[13-15]. High TGFβ1 expression represents an important
prognostic parameter after surgical resection for patients

weight (Fig. 1C); in contrast, less of a difference was
observed in the mouse body weight between the fucoidanfed mice and ddH2O control groups (Fig. 1D). Using
western blot analyses to verify the TGFR expression of
the tumor lesions, we found that there was less expression
of TGFRs (TGFRI and II) in fucoidan-fed LLC1-bearing
mice than in the control group (Fig. 1E), indicating that
fucoidan down-regulates TGFRI and TGFRII protein
expression in tumor lesions in vivo. Together, these results
show that fucoidan suppresses tumorigenesis and reduces
TGFR protein expression in an LLC1-bearing mouse
model in vivo. Alternatively, to examine the degree of liver
injury in mice fed with fucoidan, the AST and ALT levels
in mice were analyzed using tail vein blood collection
at the end of fucoidan treatment. Our results indicated
neither evidence of fucoidan affecting liver functions nor
liver toxicity in the mouse model (Supplementary Figs.
1A and 1B).

Fucoidan suppresses tumorigenesis and reduces
transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor
(TGFR) protein levels in LLC1 cell-xenograft
male C57BL6 mice in vivo
Our previous finding demonstrated that fucoidan
suppresses the tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast
cancer [4]. Herein, we further examined the effect of orally
fed fucoidan on mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1)xenograft in vivo. LLC1 cells were inoculated into the
hypodermic dorsum of male C57BL6 mice, and the tumor
growth rate was assessed over 21 days. We found that
mice fed with fucoidan showed a marked dose-dependent
reduction in tumor volume (Figs. 1A and 1B) and tumor

Figure 1: Fucoidan inhibits tumorigenesis in LLC1 cell-xenograft male C57BL6 mice. LLC1 cells (2 × 105) were inoculated
into the hypodermic dorsum of male C57BL6 mice. Beginning on the seventh day, the mice were orally fed with ddH2O (control) and
48/96/144 mg of fucoidan per kg for 21 days at 7 oral feedings/week/mouse. (A) The tumor volume was measured, and (B) tumor samples
from the mice were collected at the end of treatment. (C) The tumor weight and (D) mouse weight were also measured. (E) The TGFR
protein levels of the tumor lesions were assessed. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the TGFR protein levels. Two of five
individual experiments are presented. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. Significant differences are shown (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.005,

Greater efficacy in the reduction of tumor volume/
weight and inhibition of TGFRI/II protein
expression in LLC1-bearing mice orally fed
continuously with fucoidan

we separated the mice into three separate treatment groups
with fucoidan: continuous feeding (EXP 3), discontinuous
feeding (EXP 2), and day 13-start feeding (EXP 1).
After the indicated treatments, the mice on the EXP
1 protocol had significantly smaller tumor volumes and
weights than those of the mice on the CTL protocol (Figs.
2A–2C). Additionally, the tumor volumes and weights of
the mice on the EXP 2 protocol were significantly greater
than those of the mice on the EXP 3 protocol (Figs. 2A–
2C), indicating that continuous oral feeding of fucoidan
has a greater efficacy in suppressing tumorigenesis, as
expected. Correspondingly, the EXP1 fucoidan treatment
had a lower efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth than the
EXP 3 or EXP 2 treatments. Fucoidan could also attenuate
tumor growth in LLC1-bearing mice in the EXP 1 group

Considering that fucoidan inhibits tumor growth in
LLC1-bearing mice, we hypothesized that oral feeding
with fucoidan plays a pivotal role in the manipulation
of tumor growth/size in LLC1-bearing mice. To test this
hypothesis, we examined the tumor volume in mice with
or without oral feeding with fucoidan during the growth
of tumor-bearing mice and compared the tumor volume
in mice orally fed with fucoidan or ddH2O (CTL) during
the entire testing period (Supplementary Fig. 2). Briefly,

Figure 2: Continuous treatment of fucoidan has a greater efficacy in reducing the tumor volume and inhibits the
expression of TGFRI and TGFRIL. LLC1 cells (2 × 105) were inoculated into the hypodermic dorsum of male C57BL6 mice; on the

7th day, the mice were divided into four groups and processed in a “control-start-stop-continuous” fashion (Supplementary Fig. 2). Briefly,
the mice were separated into four groups: those orally fed only with ddH2O (control); those that began receiving oral feeding of fucoidan
on day 13 (EXP 1); those that ceased receiving oral feeding of fucoidan on day 13 (EXP 2); and those that were continuously fed fucoidan
for all 26 days (144 mg/kg) (EXP 3). The groups that were fed with fucoidan were fed 7 times/week/mouse. (A) The tumor volume was
measured, and (B) tumor samples from the mice were collected. (C) The tumor weight and (D) mouse weight were also measured. At the
end of treatment, (E) the TGFR proteins were analyzed from the lysates of the LLC1-xenografted tumors by western blotting. Three of five
individual experiments are presented (n = 5). Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. Significant differences are shown (*P < 0.05 and **P
< 0.01, compared with the control group).

vivo, we next examined the effect of fucoidan on human
NSCLC cells, A549 and CL1-5, and on mouse LLC1 cells
in vitro. We used the MTT assay to examine the effect of
fucoidan on the growth pattern of these lung cancer cells
at 24, 48 and 72 h and found 40–60% inhibition of cell
viability after 72 h of fucoidan treatment (at 100 and 200
μg/ml) in these cells compared with the control (Fig. 3A).
We further examined the synergistic effect of fucoidan
combined with cisplatin and found synergistic cytotoxic
effects on LLC1 (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Our data showed that fucoidan results in the low
expression of TGFRs in tumor lesions in LLC1-xenograft
mice (Figs. 1E and 2E). Because the molecular networks
of TGFR, including Smad pathway (Smad2/3) and nonSmad pathway molecules (e.g., Akt and Erk), regulate
cancer cell survival and metastasis [6, 32], we examined
whether fucoidan suppresses the activity of Smad and non-

compared with the CTL group. There was no difference
in body weight among the tested mice during the testing
period (Fig. 2D). We also examined the expression of
TGFRs in the tumor lesions and found lower expression
of TGFRs in the EXP 3 group than in the CTL group (Fig.
2E), similar to the results in Fig. 1E. Taken together, these
results support the notion that continuous oral feeding
of fucoidan efficiently suppresses lung tumorigenesis in
mice.

Fucoidan inhibits viability and decreases TGFRmediated Smad and non-Smad pathway activity
in lung cancer cells in vitro
Because we demonstrated that fucoidan suppresses
the tumorigenesis of an LLC1-xenograft mouse model in

Figure 3: Fucoidan inhibits proliferation and decreases TGFR-mediated Smad and non-Smad pathway activity in
lung cancer cells. Fucoidan inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer cells (A) A549, CL1-5, and LLC1. The cells were treated with

various doses of fucoidan (0–300 μg/ml) for 24, 48, and 72 h; the viability of the cells was determined using the MTT assay. Each group
of fucoidan-treated samples was normalized against each untreated control. The data are representative of three separate experiments and
are presented as the mean ± SD; error bars indicate SD. Significant differences are shown (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, compared with the
control group). (B) CL1-5 cells were treated with fucoidan (100 or 200 μg/ml) for 1 h. (C) CL1-5 cells were pre-treated with fucoidan (200
μg/ml) for 2 h and then treated with TGFβ (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The treatments were followed by western blotting analyses of whole cell
lysates to detect the expression of p-Smad2/3 (Ser423/425), p-Akt (Ser473), p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr 204). Smad2/3, Akt and Erk were used
as internal controls for loading.

Smad pathways. As shown in Fig. 3B, fucoidan decreased
the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, Akt and Erk in CL1-5
cells. Next, using Akt and Erk inhibitors, we found that
blockade of Akt and Erk signaling abolished TGFβ1stimulated cell viability (data not shown). Furthermore,
using TGFβ1 to stimulate TGFR downstream signaling
pathways, we found that TGFβ1 stimulation enhanced
the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, Akt, and Erk in NSCLC;
however, fucoidan still abolished the TGFβ1-induced
phosphorylation of these molecules (Fig. 3C). Taken
together, these data showed that fucoidan inhibition of
cell viability in lung cancer cells partly involves targeting

TGFR, with the consequent attenuation of the Smad2/3,
Akt, and Erk signaling pathways.

Fucoidan accelerates the degradation of TGFRI/
II and reduces the stability of TGFRI/II
To investigate how fucoidan decreases TGFRs
inisolated tumor lesion samples from LLC-bearing mice,
we examined the effect of fucoidan on TGFRI/II protein
expression in various lung cancer cells such as CL1-5,
A549 and LLC1. The results of western blotting analyses
showed that fucoidan rapidly reduces TGFRI and TGFRII

Figure 4: Fucoidan reduces the expression of TGFRI and TGFRII proteins by potentially accelerating protein
degradation in NSCLCs. Lung cancer cells CL1-5 (A), LLC1 (B), and A549 (C) were treated with fucoidan (100 and 200 μg/ml)

for 1 or 3 h, respectively, followed by western blotting of whole cell lysates to detect the expression of TGFRI (V-22) and TGFRII (C16). Actin was used as an internal control. This experiment is representative of three similar experiments. (D) Time-course studies of
TGFRI and TGFRII degradation. Cycloheximide (CHX, 100 μg/ml) was added to CL1-5 cells in the presence and absence of fucoidan

panel). Quantification of the intensities of the bands of TGFRI (left lower panel) and TGFRII (right lower panel) in the experiment are

fucoidan-induced decrease in TGFRI/II proteins, an in
vitro ubiquitination activity assay was conducted against
ubiquitin proteins to examine the role and involvement
of ubiquitin (ubiquitination) in the fucoidan-mediated
proteasome degradation of the TGFR proteins in NSCLC
(CL1-5 and A549). The cells were pre-incubated with
MG-132 and treated with fucoidan, and then the whole
cell lysates were incubated with anti-TGFR antibodies.
The immunoprecipitated proteins were next assessed
using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. We found that the
degenerated TGFRI/II proteins could be detected using an
anti-ubiquitin antibody, indicating that TGFRI/II proteins
were ubiquitinated during the fucoidan-induced decrease
in TGFR proteins. Specifically, we demonstrated that the
intensity of the smeared bands of degenerated TGFRI/II
proteins in fucoidan-treated cells was stronger than that in
control cells (Figs. 5B-1 and 5B-2). Similar results were
found in ubiquitination activity assays of A549 cells (data
not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the
smeared bands consisted of polyubiquitinated TGFRI and
II proteins via the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome
pathways (UPPs) in fucoidan-enhanced TGFR degradation
in NSCLC.

protein expression in these cells in a dose- and timedependent fashion compared with the levels in control
cells (Figs. 4A–4C and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) but
does not down-regulate the mRNA levels of these TGFRs
upon fucoidan treatment (data not shown). In addition,
we found that fucoidan down-regulates the expression of
TGFRs for 24 h.
Next, using cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor
of de novo protein synthesis, we further dissected the
effect and function of fucoidan on the stability of the
TGFRI/II proteins. Initially, we found that the half-life of
TGFRs in CL1-5 cells was much longer when the cells
were exposed to cycloheximide (CHX) alone (Fig. 4D).
However, when the cells were co-treated with fucoidan
and CHX, the degradation of TGFRI and TGFRII was
significantly accelerated–i.e., the stability of TGFRs was
dramatically reduced (Fig. 4D), a finding that is consistent
with that in our previous reports [4]. In essence, the halflife of the TGFRI and TGFRII proteins in cells upon the
co-treatment of fucoidan and CHX decreases to ~3 h and
~4 h, respectively, compared with that in cells treated with
CHX alone (approximately longer than 24 h for both)
(Fig. 4D). These results indicated that fucoidan has a
unique function and activity in the acceleration of TGFR
degradation in lung cancer cells.

Fucoidan enhances the conjugation of Smad
ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2)
and Smad7 on TGFRs, and Smurf2-shRNA (shSmurf2) interferes/disturbs the fucoidan-induced
degradation of TGFRs

Fucoidan reduces TGFRI/II protein expression in
lung cancer cells via the acceleration of ubiquitindependent proteasome pathway (UPP)-mediated
degradation

Smurf2 is one of the most important E3 ligases in
the regulation of TGFR expression [30, 31]. Alternatively,
Smad7, an adaptor protein, has a critical function in
promoting Smurf2 conjugation on TGFRI, contributing
to the process of TGFR hetero-complex degradation [31].
Here, we examined whether Smurf2 and/or Smad7 are
involved in the processing step of the fucoidan-mediated
UPP degradation of TGFR in lung cancer cells. As shown
in Fig. 6A, during the fucoidan treatment of CL1-5 cells,
there were significant increases in the amounts of Smurf2
and Smad7 proteins bound to TGFRI and TGFRII in the
fucoidan-treated cells by 2-fold and 1-fold, respectively,
compared with those in control cells. These results suggest
that Smurf2 and Smad7 may be involved in fucoidanenhanced, ubiquitin-dependent TGFR degradation.
Next,
we
performed
Smurf2-knockdown
experiments in CL1-5 cells. First, using Smurf2 shRNAs
such as #3476 (sh-S1), #0792 (sh-S2), and #2881 (sh-S3),
we found that Smurf2 knockdown leads to reductions in
Smurf2 expression via western blotting analysis: 58%,
43%, and 47% reduction for sh-S1, sh-S2 and sh-S3,
respectively (Fig. 6B). Second, we found that Smurf2
knockdown (sh-S2) substantially blocks the fucoidanmediated reduction in TGFRI/RII expression in CL1-5
cells (Fig. 6C, samples 2 vs 4). Specifically, as expected,

One possible mechanism by which fucoidaninduced decreases in the TGFRI and TGFRII proteins
might occur in NSCLC, as has been previously reported, is
through ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (UPP)mediated degradation. As expected, cells incubated with
fucoidan (200 μg/ml) showed 30% and 50% decreases in
the protein levels of TGFRI (Fig. 5A, upper panel, samples
1 vs 3) and TGFRII (Fig. 5A, lower panel, samples 1 vs
3), respectively. We also found that the addition of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, to the cells could prevent
the fucoidan-induced protein degradation of TGFRI
(Fig. 5A, upper panel, samples 2, 3 vs samples 5, 6) and
TGFRII (Fig. 5A, lower panel, samples 2, 3 vs samples
5, 6) compared with the cells treated with fucoidan alone
(Fig. 5A, upper and lower panels, sample 1). These results
suggest that a proteasome-dependent pathway is involved
in the fucoidan-induced degradation of the TGFRI/II
proteins. Moreover, when cells were pre-treated with MG132 followed by incubation of the cells with or without
fucoidan, we found no significant difference in the protein
expression of TGFRI (Fig. 5A, upper panel, sample 1 vs 4)
and TGFRII (Fig. 5A, lower panel, samples 1 vs 4).

Effect of Smurf2 knockdown on the fucoidanmediated UPP in TGFRI/II protein degradation
in CL1-5 cells

in the mock-transfected CL1-5 cells, fucoidan decreased
TGFRI and TGFRII by 40% and 50%, respectively,
compared with that in control cells (Fig. 6C, upper and
lower panels, samples 1 vs 2). In contrast, in sh-Smurf2transfected CL1-5 cells, no difference was noted in TGFRI
expression with and without fucoidan treatment (Fig. 6C,
upper panel, samples 3 vs 4), although a small effect of
fucoidan was observed on TGFRII (Fig. 6C, lower panel,
samples 3 vs 4). In contrast, both the TGFRI and TGFRII
protein levels were drastically increased in sh-Smurf2transfected CL1-5 cells but not in mock-transfected
cells (Fig. 6C, upper and lower panels, samples 4 vs 2),
consistent with the results of Smurf2 knockdown leading
to the reduction in Smurf2 expression (Fig. 6B).

Moreover, to further explore the role of Smurf2 in
the fucoidan-induced degradation of TGFR proteins, an in
vitro ubiquitination activity assay was conducted against
ubiquitin proteins to examine the role and involvement of
Smurf2 in the fucoidan enhancement of UPP-mediated
TGFRI/II protein degradation in sh-Smurf2-transfected
CL1-5 cells. The cells were pre-incubated with MG132 and treated with fucoidan, and then the whole cell
lysates were incubated with anti-TGFRs antibodies. The
immunoprecipitated proteins were next assessed using
an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Regarding TGFRI, in mock-

Figure 5: Fucoidan enhances the proteasome-mediated degradation/ubiquitination of TGFRs in NSCLCs. CL1-5 cells
were treated with MG132 (30 min) followed by incubation with fucoidan (100–200 μg/ml, 3 h) and then harvested for immunoblotting with
(A) TGFRI and TGFRII antibodies. The detection of ubiquitin (Ub) levels was assessed by the immunoprecipitation of TGFRI and TGFRII
(B) in CL1-5 cells. The cells were pre-treated with MG-132 (10 μM) for 30 min, followed by additional incubation with fucoidan (200
μg/ml) for 1 h. The procedure of TGFR immunoprecipitation was previously described in the Materials and Methods section. The results
showed the elevation of poly-ubiquitin expression in the presence of fucoidan; the ubiquitin (Ub) and TGFRI/II levels were measured by
western blotting analysis. This experiment is representative of three similar experiments.

I, samples 4 vs 3). These results suggest that even when
sh-Smurf2 knocks down endogenous Smurf2, fucoidan
may detour through a “Smurf2-dependent pathway” to
enhance the degradation of TGFRI; however, we could not
eliminate the possibility that the Smurf2-shRNAs we used
were less efficient in the knockdown of the endogenous
Smurf2 functions in the tested cells.
Considering the role of Smurf2 in the fucoidaninduced decrease in TGFRII proteins via UPP, we found

and sh-Smurf2-transfected cells, a higher level of TGFRI
ubiquitination was found in cells treated with MG-132
and fucoidan than in cells treated with MG-132 alone
(Fig. 6D-I, samples 2 and 4 vs 1 and 3, respectively). In
essence, the incubation of sh-Smurf2-transfected cells
with MG-132, followed by fucoidan treatment, showed a
higher level of TGFRI ubiquitination—i.e., the intensity
of the smeared bands of degenerated TGFRI protein in the
fucoidan-treated cells—than that in control cells (Fig. 6D-

CL1-5 cells treated with fucoidan (200 μg/ml) for 1 h. After incubation, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C using
anti-TGFRI and anti-TGFRII antibodies. The protein levels of Smurf2, Smad7, and TGFRI/II were measured by western blotting assays,
with the results showing the elevation of Smurf2 and Smad7 conjugation levels in TGFRs in the presence of fucoidan. (B) HEK293T cells
were transfected with three types of sh-Smurf2 plasmid (sh-S1, sh-S2 and sh-S3) to produce lentiviruses as described in the Materials
and Methods section. After harvesting the media, viruses containing individual Smurf2-shRNAs were infected into CL1-5 cells for 24 h,
followed by puromycin selection; the expression of Smurf2 was detected by western blotting of the whole cell lysates. (C) CL1-5 cells
(mock and knockdown, sh-Smurf2) were incubated with fucoidan (Fu, 200 μg/ml) for 3 h followed by western blotting of the whole cell
lysates to detect the expression of TGFRI, TGFRII and Smurf2. Actin was used as an internal control, and the numbers below the actin row
indicate the densitometric values normalized to the relative actin value. (D) Immunoprecipitation of TGFβ receptors (TGFRI and TGFRII)
in CL1-5 cells was part of the in vitro ubiquitination assay. The two groups (mock and sh-Smurf2) of CL1-5 cells were pre-cultured in MG132 (10 μM) for 30 min to inhibit proteasome activity and were subsequently treated with (Fu, 200 μg/ml) and without fucoidan (CTL) for
1 h. This experiment is representative of three similar experiments.

a higher level of fucoidan-induced TGFRII ubiquitination
(i.e., a stronger intensity of the smeared bands of
degenerated TGFRII protein) in the mock-transfected
CL1-5 cells than in the sh-Smurf2-transfected cells
(Fig. 6D-II, samples 2 vs 4), as expected. We also found
dissimilar patterns for TGFRII and TGFRI proteins in shSmurf2-transfected cells. Briefly, less of a difference was
noted in TGFRII ubiquitination in sh-Smurf2-transfected
cells treated with or without fucoidan (Fig. 6D-II, samples
4 vs 3).
Taken together, our results indicate that the
smeared bands consisted of polyubiquitinated TGFRI/II
protein, and we are the first to demonstrate that the UPP
is involved in fucoidan-mediated and fucoidan-enhanced
TGFR degradation in lung cancer cells. In addition, we
found that Smurf2 plays an important role in the assembly
of the UPP in TGFR degradation.

and alters the EMT in lung cancer cells.
Our results indicated that fucoidan promotes TGFR
degradation and inhibits cell mobility. Focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) is known to be involved in migration and
invasion as well as metastasis. We were interested in
examining the effect of fucoidan on FAK in the presence
of TGFβ1. Initially, we investigated whether TGFR
involves in the regulation of FAK in NSCLCs. Using
a TGFR kinase inhibitor, SB431542 (SB), we found
that SB down-regulates the phosphorylation of FAK by
approximately 25% in A549 and CL1-5 cells (Fig. 7D),
indicating that TGFR kinase activity may be related to the
phosphorylation of FAK in lung cancer cells. Next, in the
presence of an FAK inhibitor, PF573228 (PF), we found
that PF decreases the TGF1-induced FAK phosphorylation
(Fig. 7E) and migration (Fig. 7F) in A549 cells; similar
results were found in CL1-5 cells (data not shown). The
expression and activity of FAK have been reported to be
up-regulated in lung cancer cells and to correlate with
both malignant and metastatic disease [34]. Here, we also
examined the effect of fucoidan on the phosphorylation of
FAK. We found that fucoidan inhibits the phosphorylation
of FAK in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
Thus, to further investigate the effect of fucoidan on
the TGFβ1 induction of FAK phosphorylation, we
found that fucoidan abolishes approximately 40% of
the TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 7G).
Taken together, these results indicated that fucoidan
not only induces TGFR degradation but also partially
down-regulates FAK signaling pathways, suggesting that
fucoidan suppresses the tumorigenesis of lung cancer via
multiple pathways.

Fucoidan inhibits TGFβ-dependent mobility
(migration and invasion) and down-regulates
FAK signaling pathways in lung cancer cells
In NSCLC, the TGFβ/TGFR pathway is considered
as a tumor promoter, and the increasing TGFβ1 expression
by tumor cells correlated with tumor progression and
metastasis in lung cancer [33]. The migratory and invasive
properties of metastasis are hallmarks of malignancy.
Here, we examined and characterized the role of fucoidan
in the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. To
maximize the inhibitory effects of fucoidan on cell
migration and invasion activity in NSCLC (e.g., A549
and CL1-5 cells), the cells were stimulated with TGFβ,
which has been shown to activate TGFRs relevant to
oncogenic signaling in tumor mobility. Initially, wound
healing assays were performed to determine TGFβinduced migration in vitro; we found that fucoidan inhibits
the migration of A549 with or without TGFβ by more than
40% and 50%, respectively, compared with that of control
cells (Fig. 7A). In addition, using the Transwell® assay, we
found that fucoidan inhibits the migration of the highly
metastatic CL1-5 and LLC1 cells (Fig. 7B). Moreover,
using an invasion chamber—i.e., the Transwell® assay in
which cells invade across an extracellular matrix— we
further elucidated and examined the inhibitory effect of
fucoidan on the invasion of A549 cells with or without
exogenous TGFβ. As shown in Fig. 7C, we found that
fucoidan significantly inhibits the invasive properties
of A549 cells with or without TGFβ by more than 70%
and 60%, respectively, compared with those of control
cells. Similar results were found in an invasion assay
using CL1-5 cells (data not shown). In contrast, we found
that fucoidan enhances the expression of E-cadherin but
reduces the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin at 24
and 48 h in CL1-5 cells in a dose-dependent manner (data
not shown), suggesting that fucoidan inhibits cell mobility

DISCUSSION
TGFβ1, a multifunctional cytokine, is aberrantly
over-expressed in various types of cancer cells and is
involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
metastasis. Importantly, many studies have indicated that
TGFβ induces tumor progression and metastasis during
the late stages of lung cancer carcinogenesis [13, 15,
32]. However, fucoidan also exerts multiple biological
functions, including anti-cancer and immunoregulatory
functions. We focused on examining the effects of fucoidan
on TGFβ/TGFβR-mediated signaling pathways relevant
to anti-lung cancer. We found that fucoidan inhibits
tumorigenesis in LLC1 cell-xenograft mice and reduces
the proliferation and mobility of NSCLC. Interestingly, in
the “control-start-stop-continuous” experiments (Fig. 2),
we further demonstrated much smaller tumor volumes/
weights in LLC1-bearing mice continuously orally fed
with fucoidan compared with mice fed with ddH2O and
mice discontinuously fed with fucoidan. Surprisingly,
the tumor volumes/weights of LLC1-bearing mice that
began oral feeding with fucoidan on day 13 (EXP 1) were
nevertheless smaller than those of the control group. This

reduction in tumor volume/weight suggests that fucoidan
exerts both preventive and therapeutic functions in lung
cancer. In addition, continuous treatment with fucoidan
has greater “efficacy” in reducing the tumor volume
and inhibits the expression of TGFRI and TGFRII. We
also found that AST expression is significantly lower
in LLC1-xenograft mice with continuous fucoidan oral
feeding (fucoidan) than in the control group of mice
(CTL). Because the presence of AST is used to detect
liver damage as a clinical biomarker of liver injury in
patients/animals with some degree of intact liver function,
our current findings indicate that fucoidan exerts an
influence on neither liver function nor liver toxicity in
mice. Moreover, our results suggest that fucoidan not only
inhibits tumorigenesis but also plays a protective role
regarding the health of liver organs. In addition, one of
our main objectives in studying the effect of fucoidan on
NSCLCs and xenograft mice is to prepare for the use of
fucoidan as a nutritional/dietary supplement, rather than
as a drug-like therapy, for cancer patients in the future.
Therefore, we do not investigate the pharmacokinetics of
oral fucoidan in the current study.
Upon ligand binding, TGFRII recruits and
phosphorylates TGFRI, consequently triggering the
activation of multiple complicated down-stream signaling
cascades. The TGFβ/TGFR signal transduction pathways
are regulated at multiple levels by ubiquitin-mediated
targeting [28] and proteasomal degradation [35]. Notably,
we first found that fucoidan leads to a reduction in the
protein levels of TGFRI and TGFRII in lung cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo, in agreement with our previous reports
that fucoidan decreases metastasis by enhancing the UPP
in TGFR degradation in breast cancer [4]. Furthermore,
Smurf2 has been reported to be one of the most important
E3 ligases that regulate TGFR degradation [36]. Here,
we are the first to demonstrate that fucoidan enhances
the amount of Smurf2/Smad7 conjugating with (binding
to) TGFRI in NSCLC. Above all, fucoidan induction of
the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated pathway in TGFR
degradation is correlated with Smurf2/Smad7 activity,
indicating that fucoidan either induces the activity of
Smurf2 or triggers other proteins or pathways to cooperate
with Smurf2 in the regulation of TGFR protein expression.
Considering the effect of fucoidan on NSCLCs in
our studies, some questions may be raised, such as the
types of responses (extracellular or intracellular) that
occur in fucoidan-treated cells, how fucoidan interacts
with the cells, and whether fucoidan induces any signal
transduction. Based on our previous studies on the
effects of fucoidan on macrophages, we found that the
binding of fucoidan to macrophage scavenger receptor-A
(MSR-A) in human THP-1 macrophages triggered the
tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins, including
phospholipase C-γ1 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase
[37]. Moreover, in examining MSR-A-mediated signal
transduction upon fucoidan stimulation, we found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

fucoidan induces the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α
and interleukin 1-β in murine macrophages J774A.1 and
human THP-1 macrophages [38]. In the current study,
we detected MSR-A expression on the cell membrane of
lung cancer cells including A549 and LLC1 cells (data not
shown), which was also recently reported [39, 40]. We
also found that fucoidan induced the secretion of certain
cytokines by A549 and LLC1 cells (unpublished data).
Thus, it is clear that fucoidan stimulates multiple signal
transduction pathways in cancer cells; in the future, we
will study the effects of fucoidan on specific signaling
pathways in the tumorigenesis of cancer cells.
Interestingly, we found that fucoidan rapidly
decreases TGFβ-mediated FAK phosphorylation. FAK
has been reported to play an essential role in mediating
the interaction between integrin and TGFRII and to
facilitate the oncogenic conversion of TGFβ in mammary
tumor progression and metastasis, although the specific
mechanisms remain unknown in NSCLC [41]. In the
present study, we also found that fucoidan and a TGFR
kinase inhibitor could inhibit the auto-phosphorylation
of FAK, suggesting that the non-Smad pathway of TGFR
may involve FAK regulation; however, we could not
eliminate the possibility that fucoidan-decreased TGFRs
may also directly or indirectly involve integrin-mediated
reduction of FAK signaling via the novel interaction and
crosstalk process among integrin, TGFRI and RII [42].
In the future, the effects of fucoidan on the interaction
and crosstalk among membrane receptors (e.g., TGFRs,
integrin, MSR-A) that are relevant to lung cancer
tumorigenesis will be further investigated.
In summary, our current results demonstrate that
orally administered fucoidan significantly reduces tumor
volume/weight and TGFR protein levels in LLC1xenograft mice in vivo. We propose that one of the
mechanisms for fucoidan-mediated inhibition of lung
cancer in vivo and in vitro depends on promoting the
ubiquitination and degradation of TGFRs via Smurf2/
Smad7. Moreover, in our un-published data, we also
found that fucoidan significantly inhibits LLC1 xenograft
growth and down-regulates TGFRs when administered via
intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Therefore, our results suggest
that fucoidan (oral or IP) inhibits lung tumorigenesis in
a mouse model. To dissect the mechanisms involved in
the fucoidan reduction of tumor growth in LLC1-bearing
mice, we further demonstrated that fucoidan suppresses
cell proliferation in vitro, a finding that is relevant to
tumorigenesis in lung cancer cells. Conversely, in TGFR
functions relevant to tumorigenesis, fucoidan enhances the
conjugation of Smurf2 and Smad7 with TGFRs as well
as the Smurf2-dependent ubiquitin proteasome pathway
(UPP)-mediated degradation of TGFR. Thus, our current
findings indicate that fucoidan has great potential as a
therapeutic intervention in controlling lung cancer and that
the manipulation of the Smurf2-dependent UPP-mediated
degradation of TGFR proteins may be an effective strategy

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures
Human NSCLC CL1-5 cells were obtained from
Dr. P.-C. Yang (NTU, Taiwan). Human NSCLC A549
cells and mouse lung cancer LLC1 cells were purchased
from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center
(BCRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan). CL1-5 cells were cultured in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI
medium 1640, GIBCO-Life Technologies), supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,
GIBCO-Life Technologies) and 2.0 g/L of NaHCO3.
A549 or LLC1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO-Life Technologies),
supplemented with 10% FBS and 3.7 or 1.5 g/L of
NaHCO3. Adherent cells were detached by incubation with
trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA). The cells
were maintained in an incubator in an atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C.

Male C57BL/6 strains of mice were obtained from
the National Laboratory Animal Center of Taiwan. Mice
were aged 6–8 weeks and kept under a standard protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care of National
Yang-Ming University. Each mouse was injected with
LLC1 cells (2×105 cells per mouse) subcutaneously
into the dorsum. To examine the effects of fucoidan on
tumor volume, mice were randomly distributed into two
groups and orally fed with either ddH2O (control group)
or fucoidan (experimental group). The treatment period
was as indicated, and we recorded the body weight
and tumor volume (V) (calculated using the formula:
V = length × width × thickness in mm3) of each tested
mouse three times each week. On the day prior to the
end of treatment, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were analyzed
via blood collection from the tail vein. At the end of the
treatment, the liver, lung, spleen, and tumors of the mice
were surgically collected. For analysis of the expression
of specific proteins in the tumors, the tumors were forced
through a fine wire mesh in cold PBS containing 1%
Na3VO4. The pellets were re-suspended in RBC lysis
buffer and washed with cold PBS containing 1% Na3VO4.
After removing RBCs, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer
and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g at 4°C for 15
min for further western blotting analysis.

Migration (or wound healing assay) and invasion
assays

To assess the ubiquitin regulatory ability of
fucoidan in CL1-5, A549, and LLC1 cells, the cells were
pre-cultured in MG-132 (10 μM) for 30 min to inhibit
proteasome activity, followed by treatment with or without
fucoidan (200 μg/ml) for 60 and 150 min. The cells
were extracted with lysis buffer and then centrifuged at
13000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The cleared supernatants were
prepared for immunoprecipitation. The cell lysates (400
μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C
with various primary antibodies (1 μg); protein A/G was
added to the immunoprecipitates followed by incubation at
4°C overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation
at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed 4 times in PBS
containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors.
The immunoprecipitation complex was subjected to SDSPAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin
antibody to detect polyubiquitinated TGFR proteins. The
results of the in vitro ubiquitination assays were visualized
using an enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting
system. The detailed procedure has been described
previously [4].

The migration activity of lung cancer cells was
assessed using the Costar Transwell® procedure. Briefly,
cells (1×104/each well) were seeded in the upper chamber
in diluted 0.5% FBS-DMEM and treated with fucoidan
(100 μg/ml). The cell migration ability over 24 h was
then assessed. For the lung cancer cell invasion assay,
Transwell® filters coated with an appropriate amount
of Matrigel® (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) were
used. Cells (5×104/each well) were seeded in the upper
chamber wells and incubated for 24 h. Cells that migrated
through the basement membrane ﬁlter were ﬁxed with
70% methanol for 10 min and stained with Liu’s stain.
The lower face of the membrane was examined, and the
migrated cells were counted under a microscope. The
detailed procedure has been described previously [4].

Statistical analysis
All of the data are expressed as the mean ± standard

Design and transfection of specific short hairpin
RNA oligonucleotides (shRNAs) targeting Smurf2
Based on the sequence of the human Smurf2
gene (NM_022739.3), three specific shRNAs
targeting Smurf2 were obtained from the National
RNAi Core Facility Platform (Academia Sinica,
Taipei, Taiwan). The targeting sequences for
Smurf2 are 5’-GTGTGGATACTTGAGAATGAT-3’
(Smurf2
shRNA#3476,
shS1),
5’-GTGGACTGCAGTCGTTTATTT-3’
(Smurf2
shRNA#0792,
shS2)
and
5’-GCTGGATTTCTCGGTTGTGTT-3’
(Smurf2
shRNA#2881, shS3), which are also described and shown
in Supplementary Table S1. To produce stable clones
of Smurf2-knockdown cell lines, we used in vitro gene
delivery of lentiviral vectors as previously described [4345]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were cultured in a 10-cm
dish for 24 h. After reaching an 80% density/well, using
the manufacturer’s protocol, we transfected the cells
with individual plasmids using the Lipofectamine 2000
reagent as follows: TRC library plasmid, pLKO.1-shRNA
(Smurf2); packaging plasmid, pCMV-∆R8.91 (containing
gag, pol, rev genes); and envelope plasmid, pMD.G
(VSV-G expression plasmid). After 24 h, the media of
the plates were changed by removing the transfection
reagent and replaced with BSA-containing growth media.
At 40 and 64 h post-transfection, the media containing
lentiviruses were harvested. In addition, the targeted
CL1-5 cells were infected with the viral suspension and
