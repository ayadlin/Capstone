ABSTRACT
Histone lysine methylation regulates gene expression and cancer initiation.
Bioinformatics analysis suggested that DOT1L, a histone H3-lysine79 (H3K79)
methyltransferase, plays a potentially important role in breast cancer. DOT1L
inhibition selectively inhibited proliferation, self-renewal, metastatic potential
of breast cancer cells and induced cell differentiation. In addition, inhibitors
of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), such as neplanocin and
3-deazaneplanocin, also inhibited both H3K79 methylation and proliferation
of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The activity of SAHH inhibitors was
previously attributed to inhibition of H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2. However,
inhibition of EZH2 by a specific inhibitor did not contribute to cell death. SAHH
inhibitors had only weak activity against H3K27 methylation and their activity is
therefore mainly due to DOT1L/H3K79 methylation inhibition. Overall, we showed
that DOT1L is a potential drug target for breast cancer.

factors AF4, AF9, AF10 and ENL [9–13], which might
control the location and extent of H3K79 methylation
across the human genome.
DOT1L is a drug target for mixed lineage
leukemia (MLL) gene rearranged leukemia [14–16]. The
onco-MLL loses its C-terminal segment and is fused
with a partner protein, e.g., AF4, AF9, AF10 or ENL,
which can recruit DOT1L, causing abnormal H3K79
methylation. This leads to overexpression of a number
of MLL target genes (e.g., HoxA9 and Meis1) and
eventually the initiation of leukemia. EPZ004777
(1, developed by Epizyme, Inc.) [16] and SYC-522
(2, by us) [17] shown in Figure 1a were recently
reported to potently inhibit DOT1L (Ki: 0.3 and 0.5
nM, respectively), with >1,000-fold selectivity over
other HMTs. These DOT1L inhibitors also exhibit selective
activity against MLL-rearranged leukemia [16–18].

INTRODUCTION
Post-translational
modifications
such
as
methylation of histone lysine side chains play important
roles in gene regulation and dysfunction of histone
methylation often leads to diseases such as cancer
[1–4]. Histone H3-lysine79 (H3K79) methylation
has been recently found to be a marker for active
gene transcription from yeast to mammals [5–7].
DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1 like), a
human homolog of DOT1 in yeast, is the only histone
methyltransferase that produces methylated H3K79
(H3K79mex, x = 1, 2 or 3) (7, 8). Given the crucial roles
of H3K79 methylation in transcriptional elongation,
DOT1L’s function is tightly regulated: DOT1L has been
found to be assembled as a member of several large
transcription protein complexes containing transcription

Despite the crucial roles of H3K79 methylation in
gene regulation, few publications have linked DOT1L to
other diseases to date [19]. A recent paper describes small
interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated DOT1L knockdown
inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cell lines, such as
A549 [20]. However, we found that DOT1L inhibitors
1 and 2 had negligible activity against A549 cells
(described below). Here, we report that DOT1L is a novel
drug target for breast cancer. DOT1L/H3K79 methylation
inhibition selectively inhibited proliferation, induced
differentiation, and reduced cell migration and invasiveness
of breast cancer cells with a relatively high DOT1L.

in previous studies against MLL leukemia [16, 17].
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited only weak activity (EC50:
12 – >50 µM) against breast cancer cells MDA-MB157
and HCC70 with low DOT1L expression levels as well as
non-breast cancer cells A549 and NB4.
To see if DOT1L inhibition is responsible for the
anti-proliferation activity, compounds 1 and 2 were found
to only inhibit H3K79 methylation in MDA-MB231
cells with IC50 values of ~50 and 100 nM, respectively
(Fig. 1c). Next, three siRNAs targeting DOT1L were
used to treat MDA-MB231 cells. siRNA-1 significantly
reduced H3K79 methylation and also slowed down cell
proliferation (Fig. 1d/e). Two other siRNAs as well as a
negative control siRNA that did not significantly decreased
H3K79 methylation levels had insignificant activity. To
exclude possible off-target effects, one additional siRNA
was found to be able to reduce H3K79 methylation as
well as cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 4a/b)
during the revision of the manuscript. Similar activities
were observed for ER+ MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 4c-e). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with compound
1 resulted in considerably reduced H3K79 methylation in
a dose-dependent manner. DOT1L knockdown by three
siRNAs also led to decreased H3K79 methylation as well
as inhibited cell proliferation. Overall, these observations
showed that H3K79 methylation is important for DOT1L+
breast cancer (regardless of ER status) and DOT1L
inhibition selectively inhibits proliferation of these cells.

RESULTS
DOT1L was suggested to link to breast cancer
Exploring a breast cancer genomic database
(https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/) covering >1,000
patient samples including 100 normal breast tissues [21],
we found higher expression of DOT1L is significantly
correlated with breast cancer (p < 0.001) as compared to
normal breast tissues (Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover,
higher DOT1L levels in ~50% breast cancers correlate
with overexpression of ~20 pro-proliferation genes
in the left-panel of the PAM50 gene set (p < 0.001)
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Overexpression of these genes
links to high proliferation and poor prognosis of breast
cancer [22]. These results suggested that the function(s) of
DOT1L could be important to breast cancer.
Analysis also showed DOT1L expression levels are
significantly correlated with estrogen receptor negative
(ER−) breast cancers (Supplementary Fig. 3A), although
a smaller proportion of ER+ breast cancers still express
relatively high levels of DOT1L. In addition, DOT1L
is not significantly correlated with expression of human
epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (Supplementary
Fig. 3B), a biomarker for another clinically important
subtype of breast cancer.

DOT1L inhibition reduced self-renewal and
promoted differentiation
Treatment of MDA-MB231 cells with compound
2 at 2 µM caused a negligible amount of apoptosis. At
a higher concentration of 10 µM, it induced a modest
apoptotic rate of ~8%, which is consistent with the result
of cell cycle assay showing a moderately increased
pre-G phase cell population (Supplementary Fig. 5a/b).
These results suggested that the DOT1L inhibitors
inhibit cell proliferation with a different mechanism from
cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. We next tested whether
these compounds have activity against cancer stem
cells (CSCs), which are a small fraction of cancer cells
that have certain stem cell traits (e.g., self-renewal and
ability to differentiate) and can initiate new tumors when
transplanted to a new host. CSCs have been known to be
resistant to cytotoxic drugs that target rapidly dividing
cancer cells and therefore believed to be responsible for
drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Due to heterogeneity
of breast cancers, there have been debates on what cell
markers characterize breast CSCs [23, 24]. Nevertheless,
many studies showed that breast CSCs are enriched in the
CD44+/CD24−/low subpopulation [25] as well as that with
a high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH+)
[26], which plays an important role in maintaining stem/
progenitor cells. Upon treatment of MDA-MB231 cells

DOT1L inhibition selectively inhibited
proliferation of DOT1L+ breast cancer cells
We tested the activity of DOT1L specific inhibitors
1 and 2 against a panel of five breast cancer cell lines.
Also included in the study were lung cancer A549 and
non-MLL leukemia NB4 cells. Both compounds exhibited
no or negligible activity (EC50 ≥ 15 µM) against all of
these cells during a 3-day treatment (Table 1), showing
they do not have non-specific cytotoxicity. For a 15-day
treatment, these two inhibitors had strong activity against
proliferation of MDA-MB231, BT549 (both showing ER−)
and MCF-7 (ER+) breast cancer cells expressing relatively
high levels of DOT1L (Table 1) [21], with EC50 values
of 0.19 – 1.4 µM (Fig. 1b). The slow anti-proliferation
activity for the DOT1L inhibitors was also observed

analysis showed that considerably more cells expressed
higher levels of CD24 (Fig. 2a), a cell surface protein
characteristic to breast luminal epithelial cells [27],
showing these compounds can induce differentiation
of CSC-like cells in mesenchymal MDA-MB231 cells.
The CD44+/CD24− cell population was significantly
decreased (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5c).
ALDEFLUOR experiments (Fig. 2c and Supplementary

Fig. 5d/e) showed that treatment with compounds 1 and
2 considerably reduced the ALDH+ cell population. These
results suggested that these compounds can reduce the
number of CSC-like cells by inducing cell differentiation.
Moreover, compounds 1 and 2 can inhibit the ability of
MDA-MB231 to form secondary mammospheres, a
method to characterize the number of CSC-like cells in
breast cancer cells [28], by 30 - >60% in a dose dependent
manner (Fig. 2d). All these results supported that DOT1L

overexpressed in breast cancer and link to aggressiveness
and poor prognosis of breast cancer [22]. Among these,
down-regulation of seven genes (CCNB1, MYBL2,
CENPF, CCNE1, CDC20, UBE2C and PTTG1) was
confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 3e). These results suggested that
down-regulation of these pro-proliferation genes of breast
cancer contributes to the anti-proliferation activity of the
DOT1L inhibitors.

DOT1L inhibition impaired EMT and metastatic
potential
In addition to rendering drug resistance, CSC
is closely linked to epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and metastasis [29, 30]. EMT, characterized
by high expression of TGF-β, Snail, Zeb genes as well
as low expression of cell-cell adhesion genes such as
E-cadherin, is important for cancer cells to be migratory,
invasive and generate metastasis. Using quantitative PCR
(qPCR), incubation of MDA-MB231 cells with compound
2 can significantly reduce gene expression of TGF-β,
Snail and Zeb, as well as increase that of E-cadherin in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2e), showing the ability of
the DOT1L inhibitor to inhibit EMT. Impaired EMT by
DOT1L inhibition was also demonstrated by in vitro cell
migration and invasion assays. DOT1L inhibitors 1 and 2
can inhibit cell migration as well as Matrigel invasion of
MDA-MB231 by ~50% and 25% (Fig. 2f), respectively,
indicating the potential of these compounds to inhibit
tumor metastasis.

SAHH inhibitors selectively inhibited DOT1L/
H3K79 methylation
We found that inhibition of S-adenosylhomocycteine (SAH) hydrolase (SAHH) by neplanocin
A (3) and its analog 3-deazaneplanocin A (4) (Fig.  4a)
[32, 33] is an alternative approach to selective
DOT1L inhibition. As illustrated in Supplementary
Figure 7, DOT1L as well as all other histone/protein
methyltransferases use S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) as
the enzyme cofactor and generate SAH upon completion
of the methylation reaction. SAH is a strong, endogenous
inhibitor of DOT1L with a Ki value of 160 nM [34, 35].
However, the inhibitory activity of SAH is considerably
weaker against other lysine methyltransferases
(Ki > 1 µM) [35]. To maintain cellular methylation, SAH
is rapidly hydrolyzed by SAHH, which keeps a high
cellular SAM:SAH ratio of ~40:1 [36]. Compound 3 (as
well as 4) potently inhibited SAHH with a Ki of 8.4 nM
and caused a decreased SAM:SAH ration of up to 1:1.5
[32], which could effectively inhibit DOT1L (as well as
other methyltransferases to a lesser extent). Compounds
3 and 4 were found to potently and selectively inhibit
H3K79 methylation with IC50 values of ~50 nM (Fig. 4b).
However, at concentrations of <1 µM, no or negligible
inhibitory activities of 3 and 4 were observed against
methylation at H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36 and
H4K20 (Fig. 4b). Particularly, SAH was reported to be
considerably less active against H3K27 methyltransferase
EZH2 with a Ki of 7.5 µM [35]. Consistently with the
biochemical data, the activities of compounds 3 and 4
against H3K27 methylation were found to be weak with
IC50s of >6 µM (Fig. 4b).

Microarray studies of DOT1L inhibition
Given that H3K79 methylation is a master regulator
for gene transcription, a whole-genome profiling was
performed to determine how DOT1L inhibition changes
gene expression, in order to find the mechanism by which
these compounds reduce proliferation of breast cancer
cells. RNA was isolated from MDA-MB231 cells treated
with siRNA-1 and compounds 1 and 2, amplified, and
hybridized to Illumina HT-12 microarrays. The data were
log2-transformed and normalized to have the same median
value for all arrays. Moderate t-test was used to examine
whether genes were differentially expressed between the
controls and treatments, with the filter thresholds being
p-values < 0.05 and fold changes >4. As compared to
the control samples, treatments with compounds 1, 2 and
siRNA-1 were found to cause highly similar changes in
gene expression pattern (Fig. 3a/b and Supplementary Fig.
6a/b) (p = 10−14 and 10−16), indicating that the observed
activities of the two compounds were mediated by
DOT1L inhibition. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
showed that treatment with the DOT1L inhibitors caused
significant up-regulation of the gene set whose expression
is low in breast CSCs (31) (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. 6c). These results were consistent with our
experimental observations and supported that DOT1L
inhibition impairs CSCs.
In addition, as shown in Fig. 3d and Supplementary
Fig. 6d, treatment with the DOT1L inhibitors led to
significant down-regulation of the pro-proliferation
genes in the PAM50 gene set, which were found to be

Compounds 3 and 4 were next tested for their
activity against proliferation of the three DOT1L+ breast
cancer cells. 3 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity in a 3-day
treatment with EC50 values of 0.9–2.6 µM (Fig. 4c). This
is because compound 3 can be phosphorylated at its
5ʹ-OH in cells and inhibits cellular DNA/RNA synthesis
[37]. Presumably due to the lack of the 3-N atom in the
purine ring, compound 4 is less efficiently phosphorylated
and showed no general cytotoxicity in a 3-day treatment
with the EC50 values of >20 µM. For a 15-day treatment,

the activity of compound 4 is mainly mediated by H3K79
methylation inhibition.

specific EZH2 inhibitor, EPZ005687 (5, Fig. 4a) [40],
was synthesized. With its reported Ki value of 24 nM
against EZH2, compound 5 inhibited H3K27 methylation
in the breast cancer cells with IC50s of ~50 nM (Fig. 4d).
However, 5 exhibited only weak anti-proliferation
activities against the three breast cancer cells with EC50
values of 11-35 µM (Fig. 4c) regardless of the treatment
durations. These observations demonstrated that inhibition
of EZH2/H3K27 methylation cannot significantly affect
the proliferation of these breast cancer cells.

EZH2/H3K27 methylation inhibition did not
contribute to breast cancer killing
Compound 4 was previously reported to have
activity against several cancer cells, including MCF-7
and MDA-MB231 [38, 39]. In these studies, the activity
of 4 was mainly attributed to EZH2/H3K27 methylation
inhibition. However, because of the large differences
between the anti-proliferation activity (EC50: 35-480 nM)
and H3K27 methylation inhibition (IC50 >6 µM) for 4,
our results supported that DOT1L/H3K79 methylation
inhibition (with IC50 ~50 nM, Fig. 4b) is mainly
responsible for the activity of compound 4 against these
breast cancer cells.

Compound 3 is of particular interest, because of

a combination therapy should be more effective to treat
DOT1L+ breast cancer, especially given the slow action of
the DOT1L-specific inhibitors 1 and 2. A potent cytotoxic

more time for H3K79 methylation inhibition to correct
cancer-relevant gene expression and inhibit CSCs, with
the potential to eventually eliminate all cancer cells.
More biological activity testing of compound 3 was
performed. Compound 3 (20 nM) was found to induce
apoptosis of 12.1% MDA-MB231 cells on day 7, which
was consistent with a cell cycle analysis showing an
increased sub-G1 population (Supplementary Fig. 8a/b).
Similar to DOT1L-specific inhibitors, 3 exhibited strong
activities against breast CSCs. Drug treatment caused
differentiation of MDA-MB231 CSC-like cells, resulting
in a significantly expanded CD24+ cell population
(Fig.  5a). Treatment with 3 also reduced the CD44+/
CD24− (Fig. 5b) and ALDH+ cell populations (Fig. 5c
and Supplementary Fig. 8c). In addition, as compared to
1 and 2, compound 3 showed more pronounced activity
to inhibit formation of secondary mammospheres as
well as cell migration and invasiveness of MDA-MB231
(Fig. 5d). The increased potency of compound 3 in these
assays could be attributed to the synergistic (or additive)
effect for the dual-role compound.

DISCUSSION
Breast cancer has posed a major threat to women’s
health, accounting for ~25% of all female cancers and
causing ~440,000 deaths per year worldwide. Breast
cancer patients rarely die of the local tumors, with
>90% of the mortalities being due to metastasis and
drug resistance followed by tumor recurrence. CSCs are
believed to be responsible for breast cancer metastasis
and recurrence, because of their drug resistance and
association with EMT. Discovery of compounds that have
selective activity against CSCs is therefore of importance.
Critical roles of histone methylation in cancer
have projected the perspective that selective modulators
of histone methylation could be novel probes for cancer
biology studies as well as clinically useful therapeutics.
Although development of such compounds has still
been in its infancy [4], activities of DOT1L inhibitors
(e.g., compounds 1 and 2) against MLL-rearranged
leukemia (16–18, 41) and EZH2 inhibitors
(e.g.,  compound 5) against EZH2-mutated lymphoma
[40] have demonstrated the potential as well as ample
opportunities for this direction.
In the present study, bioinformatics analysis of
a large breast cancer genetic database has implicated
that DOT1L plays an important role in the malignancy.
DOT1L-specific inhibitors 1 and 2 were found to have
strong activity against proliferation of DOT1L+ breast
cancer cells with EC50 values as low as 190 nM, but
these compounds were inactive against DOT1L−/low breast
or non-breast cancer cells. Comparative studies of the
microarray data between siRNA and compounds 1/2
indicated the activity of these compounds is mediated
by DOT1L inhibition, but not due to off-target effects.
These results showed that DOT1L is a novel drug target
for DOT1L+ breast cancer. Given ~50% breast cancers
in the clinic express relatively high levels of DOT1L
(Supplemental Fig. 2), this finding could have a high
impact to breast cancer research and treatment.
Mechanistically, anti-proliferation activity of the
DOT1L inhibitors is not due to cytotoxicity. By inhibiting
H3K79 methylation, a key “histone code” for active gene
transcription, compounds 1 and 2 were able to downregulate expression of the genes that are important to
breast cancer growth (e.g., pro-proliferation genes in
PAM50, Fig. 3d/e). In addition, DOT1L inhibition can
down-regulate expression of EMT genes and reduce in
vitro cell migration and Matrigel invasion, showing the
potential to inhibit tumor metastasis. The characteristic,
slow action of the DOT1L inhibitors could be due to a
long time needed for a series of cellular events that lead
to proliferation arrest, including H3K79 methylation
inhibition (with the maximal effect occurring in ~4 days)

Neplanocin A (3) exhibited potent in vivo
antitumor activity without overt toxicity
Because DOT1L inhibitors 1 and 2 have poor
pharmacokinetics with short plasma half-lives [16], we
did not examine the in vivo antitumor activity of these
compounds. Rather, due to its extremely potent activity
as well as novel mechanism of action, compound 3 was
evaluated for the in vivo antitumor activity using an MDAMB231 xenograft mouse model. 106 cells per mouse were
injected into the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice
and palpable tumors (with diameters of ~3 mm) were
observed in ~7 days. Compound 3 was administered
in a dose of 4 mg/kg/day for 28 days using an osmotic
pump implanted subcutaneously in each mouse. This
administration route was chosen because previous studies
showed the importance of constant H3K79 methylation
inhibition [41]. As compared to the tumors (n = 13) in the
control group, the treatment (n = 9) caused tumor growth
inhibition of >95% (Fig. 5e), together with significantly
prolonged animal survivals (Fig. 5f). Four tumors (out of
nine) in the treatment group were found to exhibit tumor
regression during the treatment and remained to be small
(1-3 mm in diameter) in the end of the experiment. In a
separate experiment, three mice each from the control and
treatment groups were sacrificed on day 14 and tumor
tissues were extracted. Western blot experiments for the
freshly separated cells showed only H3K79 methylation
was significantly inhibited by the treatment with
compound 3 (Fig. 5g). These results were consistent with
the cell based experiments. In addition, the compound
was found to cause no obvious toxicities: no significant
changes in blood cell counts, hemoglobin (Fig. 5h) and
body weight were observed on day 28. These  results

the CD44+/CD24− cell population and increased CD44+/CD24+ cell population, (c) inhibited secondary mammosphere formation, and
(d) reduced cell migration and invasiveness. These results showed that 3 inhibited breast CSC-like cells and EMT; (e, f) Treatment with 3
(4 mg/kg/day for 28 days) significantly inhibited (e) tumor growth and (f) prolonged animal survivals in an MDA-MB231 xenograft
mouse model; (g) In vivo treatment with 3 only significantly reduced H3K79 methylation levels in tumor tissues; (h) Treatment with 3
(4 mg/kg/day for 28 days) did not cause significant changes in blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels in mice (n = 3 for control and
treatment groups). (Statistical analysis by Student’s t test: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01)

followed by decreased mRNA expression of the target
genes, as well as ultimately the depletion of the gene
products (proteins) key to cancer proliferation. Moreover,
despite the importance of DOT1L in maintaining
hematopoiesis [42, 43], pharmacological inhibition of
DOT1L did not cause overt toxicities (shown in this and
previous studies [16, 41]), indicating that there could be
a sufficient therapeutic window for clinical applications.
In addition, inhibition of SAHH was found to be
an alternative approach to selective inhibition of H3K79
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

methylation, because SAH is a more potent, endogenous
inhibitor of DOT1L than other lysine methyltransferases
[34, 35]. Indeed, our experiments showed that potent
SAHH inhibitors 3 and 4 selectively decreased H3K79
methylation with IC50 of ~50 nM. However, these
compounds had negligible effects on other lysine
methylation sites at concentrations of <1 µM. Similar
to DOT1L-specific inhibitors 1 and 2, compound 4 also
exhibited strong anti-proliferation activity against DOT1L+
breast cancer cells, mainly because of H3K79 methylation

inhibition. Compound 3, a dual-role compound that is both
a selective H3K79 methylation inhibitor and a cytotoxic
agent, was found to have the most potent antitumor
activity in vitro and in vivo, showing that the combination
therapy could be a viable approach to breast cancer
treatment.
The activity of compound 4 was previously
attributed to EZH2 inhibition, likely due to the importance
of EZH2-containing polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2) as well as the observation of EZH2-overexpression
in many types of cancers [44–46]. However, the weak
activity of SAH against EZH2 as well as the weak
inhibition of H3K27 methylation by 4 indicated that this
is less likely to be the case. This point was confirmed by
the weak anti-proliferation activity of the potent EZH2
inhibitor 5, showing that inhibition of H3K27 methylation
alone was not sufficient to inhibit proliferation of these
cancer cells. Presumably, other proteins such as DNA
methyltransferase [47, 48] also participate in PRC2mediated gene repression. Therefore, inhibition of EZH2/
H3K27 methylation may not be sufficient to correct the
overall effects by PRC2-mediated gene silencing in these
cancer cells.

METHODS

Analysis of cell proliferation, apoptosis and
cell cycle

Western blot
106 cells/well were incubated with increasing
concentrations of a compound for 5 days and histones
extracted with the EpiQuik™ Total Histone Extraction
Kit (Epigentek) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Equal amounts of histones (2µg) were separated on SDSPAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The blots
were probed with primary antibodies, followed by antirabbit IgG (Thermo Scientific) secondary antibodies. For
western blot analysis of MDA-MB231 xenograft tumors,
tumors were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Histones were extracted and analyzed by immunoblotting
as described above.

Chemical probes

2,500 or 5,000 cells/well in 96-well plates were
incubated with increasing concentrations of a compound
for 3 or 15 days, with media and compounds refreshing
every 3-4 days. Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT
assay. The EC50 values in Table 1 were the mean values
from at least three independent experiments.
For apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, 105 cells/
well were incubated with increasing concentrations of a
compound for 7 or 10 days. Apoptosis was determined
using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection
Kit I (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Cells for cell cycle analysis were fixed in cold
70% ethanol at 4°C and stained with Propidium iodide
(Sigma-Aldrich) (20 μg/ml) and RNase A (10 μg/ml)
for 30min. Cells were analyzed using a FACS Calibur
(BD Biosciences/Applied  Biosystems) and data were
processed using the program Flowjo (version7.6.5).

Compounds 1 – 5 were synthesized using the
published methods [49, 17, 50, 51, 40] and characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) 400-MR
spectrometer, showing identical NMR spectra to those
reported. The compound purities were determined by a
Shimadzu Prominence HPLC with a Zorbax C18 column
(4.6 x 250 mm) monitored by UV absorbance at 254 nm.
The purities of all compounds were found to be >95%.

Cell culture, antibodies and RNAi
Human cell lines BT549, MDA-MB231, MCF-7,
MDA-MB157, HCC70, A549 and NB4 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
cultured using ATCC recommended conditions. Primary
antibodies against H3K79me2, H3K27me3, H3K4me3,
H3K36me2, H4K20me3, H3K9me-pan were purchased
from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). siRNA experiments
were performed by transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells
with  X-tremeGENE Transfection Reagent (Roche) and
10 nM siRNA (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The sequences for DOT1L
siRNA (Invitrogen) were:
siRNA-1:
634-CGCGAGUUCAGGAAGUGGAUGAAAU;
siRNA-2:
117-CGAUAAACAUCACGAUGCUGCUCAU;

Quantitative real-time PCR
104 cells/well were incubated with compounds
for 14 days with media containing compounds replaced
every 3-4 days. Total RNA was extracted from cells using
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 100-1000 ng of total RNA was
reverse transcribed using iScript™ Reverse Transcription
Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out
using the RT2 SYBR Green ROX™ qPCR Mastermix

10674

Oncotarget

(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurements were performed in triplicate, using GAPDH
or human 18S ribosomal RNA as a reference gene. The
sequences of primers used are listed in the Supplementary
Table. Real-time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism
7300 sequence detection system.

twice a week. The tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula length × (width)2/2. When the tumors reached
a size of about 20–30 mm3, mice were randomly segregated
into control and treatment groups. Mice in the treatment
group were implanted subcutaneously an osmotic pumps
(Alzet model 2004) containing 2.8 mg of 3 in 200 µL of
PBS. Animals were sacrificed when the volumes of tumors
reaching ~1.5 cm3. Log-rank analysis was used to determine
statistical significance of the survival curves using Prism 5.0
(GraphPad).

In vitro migration and invasion assay
5 × 104 cells/well were incubated with compounds for
14 days. For transwell migration assays, 5× 104 cells were
plated in the top chamber with the non-coated membrane
(24-well insert; pore size, 8 mm; BD Biosciences). For
invasion assays, 5× 104 cells were plated in the top chamber
with Matrigel-coated membrane. The cells on the apical
side of each insert were then scraped off after 22 h for both
assays. The wells were washed with PBS, fixed with 100%
methanol and stained with DAPI. Cells that had migrated to
the basal side of the membrane were visualized and counted
with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope at 10×. Pictures
of three random fields were obtained and the number of cells
that had migrated quantified using ImageJ analysis software.

RNA Amplification and Microarray Data
Analysis
105 cells/well were incubated with compounds
for 14 days. Cells were lysed immediately in TRIzol®
Reagent, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and shipped to
Asuragen, Inc. (Austin, TX) for microarray experiments.
RNA was isolated, amplified, and hybridized to Illumina
Human HT-12 v4 arrays according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Microarray data were log2 transformed
and then normalized to have the same median for all
the arrays. Moderate t-statistics were used to test if genes
were differentially expressed between the groups of
interest. Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to
correct for multiple comparisons. R and Bioconductor
packages were used for all the statistical analyses
(http://cran.us.r-project.org/,
http://www.bioconductor
.org/). Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using
GSEA software from Broad Institute (Boston, MA).

ALDEFLUOR assay and flow cytometry
5 × 104 cells/well were incubated with compounds
for 14 days. The ALDH activity of cells was determined by
using the ALDEFLUOR assay kit (StemCell Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Combinations
of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against
human CD44-FITC and CD24-PE were obtained from BD
Biosciences. Primary antibodies or the respective isotype
controls (BD Biosciences) were added to the cell suspension,
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation, and
incubated at 4°C for 20 min. Dead cells were eliminated using
propidium iodide (Sigma). The labelled cells were analyzed
on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences/Applied Biosystems).

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was applied to calculate the
statistical significance (p value) for all data (except
for microarray analysis) using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad).
Statistical analysis for microarray studies is described in
the Microarray section above.
