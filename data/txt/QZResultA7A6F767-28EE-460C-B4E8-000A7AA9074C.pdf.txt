Abstract
Several mucosotropic human papillomaviruses (HPV), including HPV type 16 (HPV-16), are etiologic agents of a subset of
anogenital cancers and head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas. In mice, HPV-16 E7 is the most potent of the
papillomaviral oncogenes in the development of cervical
disease. Furthermore, interfering specifically with the expression of E7 in HPV-positive cell lines derived from human
cervical cancers inhibits their ability to proliferate, indicating
that the expression of E7 is important in maintaining the
transformed phenotype in vitro. To assess the temporal role of
E7 in maintaining HPV-associated tumors and precancerous
lesions in vivo, we generated Bi-L E7 transgenic mice that
harbor a tetracycline-inducible transgene that expresses both
HPV-16 E7 and firefly luciferase. When we crossed Bi-L E7
mice to a K5-tTA transgene-inducing line of mice, which
expresses a tetracycline-responsive transactivator selectively
in the stratified squamous epithelia, the resulting Bi-L E7/
K5-tTA bitransgenic mice expressed E7 and luciferase in the
skin and cervical epithelium, and doxycycline repressed
this expression. Bitransgenic mice displayed several overt
and acute epithelial phenotypes previously shown to be
associated with the expression of E7, and these phenotypes
were reversed on treatment with doxycycline. Repressing the
expression of E7 caused the regression of high-grade cervical
dysplasia and established cervical tumors, indicating that they
depend on the continuous expression of E7 for their
persistence. These results suggest that E7 is a relevant
target not only for anticancer therapy but also for the
treatment of HPV-positive dysplastic cervical lesions. [Cancer

Introduction
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small, epitheliotropic,
dsDNA viruses that cause proliferative lesions, including warts. A
subset of mucosotropic HPVs—the ‘‘high-risk’’ HPVs, including
HPV type 16 (HPV-16) and HPV-18—is associated etiologically with
the vast majority of cervical cancers, other types of anogenital
cancers, and approximately a quarter of head and neck squamous
cell carcinomas (1). HPV-16, which is a causative agent of over
half of cervical cancers (2), encodes three oncogenes: E5, E6, and E7

(3–5). E7 is best known for its ability to bind to and degrade
the tumor suppressor pRb (6), although its ability to drive
carcinogenesis is not due exclusively to this interaction (7).
To characterize the oncogenic properties of E7 in vivo, our
laboratory previously generated transgenic mice that express E7
under the control of the keratin 14 (K14) promoter (8). These
K14E7 mice display a variety of acute epithelial phenotypes
indicative of the ability of E7 to disrupt the cell cycle (9).
Furthermore, K14E7 mice develop high-grade dysplasia and
invasive cervical cancer when treated chronically with estrogen
for as little as 6 months, whereas nontransgenic mice and K14E5 3
and K14E6 (10) transgenic mice do not. These data, coupled with
previous demonstrations of the ability of E7 to transform cells in
culture (11–13), indicate the importance of E7 in the genesis of
cervical cancer.
The observation that cancerous cells depend on the continuous
expression of oncogenes for their survival has been described in
many murine systems for several oncogenes, including BCR-ABL
(14), MYC (15–17), H-Ras (18), and K-Ras (19). Whether HPVassociated cancers require the continuous expression of viral
oncogenes has been examined in tissue culture by using cell lines
derived from HPV-positive human cervical cancers. Repressing the
expression of E6 in the HPV-18–positive HeLa cell line by using the
papillomaviral E2 transcription factor results in sporadic senescence and widespread apoptosis, whereas silencing the expression
of E7 causes senescence only (20). Interfering with the expression
of E6 and E7 in HeLa cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
induces senescence at low doses of a lentiviral vector containing
the shRNA, but at high doses, apoptosis occurs (21). Conflicts in
apoptotic versus senescent responses between these and similar
studies (22–24) are difficult to reconcile and may reflect differences
in the experimental systems being used. It remains unclear
whether the requirements for high-risk E6 and E7 observed in
such studies are predictive of the in vivo dependence of cervical
cancers on their presence or specifically reflect their importance in
maintaining the growth competence of cells in tissue culture.
To assess the temporal role of E7 in the maintenance of HPVassociated cervical cancers in vivo, we generated Bi-L E7 transgenic
mice that harbor a construct containing HPV-16 E7 and firefly
luciferase, the expression of which is driven by bidirectional
promoters under the control of a tetracycline response element
(TRE). When we produced bitransgenic mice by crossing Bi-L E7
mice to a line of mice that expresses the tetracycline transactivator
(tTA) under the control of the keratin 5 promoter (K5-tTA mice;
ref. 25), they expressed both luciferase and E7 in the skin and in

the epithelium of the female reproductive tract. By administering
doxycycline, an analogue of tetracycline, to Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice, the expression of E7 and luciferase was
eliminated. Bitransgenic mice displayed an array of epithelial
phenotypes previously shown to be associated with the expression
of E7, and these phenotypes were reversed on treatment with
doxycycline. More importantly, we found that repressing the
expression of E7 caused the regression of high-grade cervical
dysplasia and established cervical tumors, indicating that both
depend on the continuous expression of E7 for their persistence.
Our findings have important implications for the treatment of
HPV-associated cervical disease.

Materials and Methods

Information.
Transgenic mice. K14E7 (8) and K5-tTA (25) transgenic mice have
been described previously. Bi-L E7 mice were genotyped by PCR using
the primers LucF (5¶-GAAATGTCCGTTCGGTTGGCAGAAGC-3¶) and LucR
(5¶-CCAAAACCGTGATGGAATGGAACAACA-3¶).

Treatment with estrogen. To induce persistent estrus and to eliminate
cycling through estrus, continuous release pellets delivering 0.05 mg of
17h-estradiol (estrogen) per 60-d period (Innovative Research of America) were
implanted s.c. into the fat pads of the shoulders of adult female virgin mice.
Treatment with doxycycline. Doxycycline-containing chow (2 g/kg;
Bio-Serv) was used to repress the expression of the Bi-L E7 transgene.
Procurement of female reproductive tracts and histologic
analysis. One hour before sacrifice, mice were injected with 5-bromo2¶-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 12.5 mg/mL in PBS) at 10 AL/g body weight.
Procured female reproductive tracts were fixed overnight at 4jC in 4%
paraformaldehyde (w/v), embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with
H&E for histologic analysis of neoplastic and dysplastic disease.
Analysis of luciferase. Tissue lysates were analyzed for the activity of
luciferase using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corp.) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis of E7. To examine the expression of E7 by Western blot, a
mixture of mouse anti-HPV-16 E7 primary antibodies was used (Invitrogen
Corp.; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Irradiation. Adult mice were mock treated or exposed to 5 Gy of
ionizing radiation from a 137Cs source and sacrificed 24 h later. One hour
before sacrifice, mice were injected with BrdUrd (12.5 mg/mL in PBS) at
10 AL/g body weight.

Results
The expression of luciferase and E7 in the skin and
epithelium of the female reproductive tracts of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice is controlled by doxycycline. To study the
temporal requirement for the expression of E7 in cervical cancers,
we generated transgenic mice using a Bi-L E7 construct. Briefly,
this transgene contains a TRE, composed of seven copies of the
tetracycline operator (tetO) sequence, flanked by two minimal
cytomegalovirus promoters in opposite orientations, which drive
the expression of firefly luciferase in one direction and HPV-16 E7
in the other (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We initially screened nine
lines of Bi-L E7 mice to determine which lines expressed luciferase
under the control of the tTA protein by crossing them to an
inducing line of K5-tTA mice that expresses tTA specifically in the
stratified squamous epithelia (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In eight of
the nine lines examined, there was no significant increase in the
expression of luciferase in the dorsal skin of singly transgenic Bi-L
E7 mice over background levels observed in nontransgenic mice
(P > 0.05, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test), indicating that there
was no leaky expression of luciferase in the absence of the tTA
protein (Supplementary Fig. S2). When we examined lysates from
the dorsal skin of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice, we observed a
significant induction of luciferase in seven of the nine lines of Bi-L
E7 mice examined (P < 0.05 versus nontransgenic, two-sided
Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Supplementary Fig. S2). Based on our
results, we chose one line of Bi-L E7 mice, line 406, which
reproducibly expressed luciferase in a manner dependent on the

presence of tTA. In all data presented hereafter, we used Bi-L E7
mice exclusively from line 406.
Administering chow containing 2 g/kg doxycycline for 1 week
to Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice eliminated the expression of
luciferase in the skin, indicating that, when the transcriptional
activity of the tTA protein was inactivated by doxycycline, the
expression of luciferase was abolished (Fig. 1A). We also examined
the expression of luciferase in lysates from the lower female
reproductive tract, where we observed an induction of luciferase
exclusively in bitransgenic mice (P < 0.05 versus nontransgenic
mice, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) that was eliminated in
mice given as little as 3 days of doxycycline (Fig. 1B). These data
indicate that luciferase is induced and can be repressed with
doxycycline in the stratified squamous epithelia of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice.
We next examined the expression of E7 in Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice by performing Western blots on lysates from the
dorsal skin and lower female reproductive tract. By using loading
controls consisting of known amounts of protein from lysates from
K14E7 mice, a line of transgenic mice that we generated previously
to characterize the oncogenic properties of E7 in vivo (8), we
determined that the level of expression of E7 in the dorsal skin of
Bi-L E7/K5-tTA mice was slightly higher than that seen in K14E7
mice (Fig. 1C). In the lower female reproductive tract, the level of
expression of E7 in bitransgenic mice was approximately half that
observed in K14E7 mice (Fig. 1D). As expected, we did not detect
E7 in lysates from bitransgenic mice given doxycycline for 1 week
or in singly transgenic Bi-L E7 mice.
These data indicate that the expression of luciferase and E7 is
induced in the dorsal skin and lower female reproductive tracts
of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice and that this expression is
repressed by administering doxycycline.
Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice display striking overt
phenotypes that are reversible on treatment with doxycycline.
We noted that Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice presented

numerous, fully penetrant overt phenotypes, including alopecia,
runting, excessive scratching, and dry and wrinkled hyperplastic
skin (Fig. 2). These phenotypes were apparent by 4 weeks of age
and invariably worsened over time. By 6 to 7 months of age,
bitransgenic mice often were nearly devoid of hair, and the
excessive scratching led to the appearance of flaky, raw, and
scabbed skin on and around the shoulders of the animals. To
determine whether we could reverse these overt phenotypes by
silencing the expression of E7, we administered doxycycline to
bitransgenic mice and monitored the amelioration of these
phenotypes over the course of 20 days (Fig. 2). After as little as
3 days on doxycycline, the skin of bitransgenic mice was noticeably
less dry and hyperplastic when compared with mice that never
received doxycycline, and by 6 days on the drug, there was obvious
regrowth of hair over the entire body. The overt phenotypes
continued to regress as the mice remained on doxycycline, and by
20 days, bitransgenic mice continuously fed doxycycline were
nearly indistinguishable from nontransgenic mice. These observations show that the overt phenotypes displayed by Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice are reversed on treatment with doxycycline,
regardless of their severity.
Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice display several acute,
microscopic phenotypes in the stratified squamous epithelia
that can be reversed with doxycycline. We have shown
previously that E7 can induce DNA synthesis in the normally

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

quiescent suprabasal compartment of the endocervical epithelium
of K14E7 mice (7). To investigate whether this induction occurs
in the endocervical epithelium of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA mice, we
performed immunohistochemical staining for BrdUrd (Fig. 3A)
in sections from mice injected with the nucleotide analogue
1 hour before sacrifice and quantified the results (Fig. 3B). In Bi-L
E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice, we observed a significant induction
of DNA synthesis in the suprabasal compartment of the epithelium
(P < 0.005 versus nontransgenic, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum
test); this induction was statistically indistinguishable from the
level observed in K14E7 mice (P = 0.28, two-sided Wilcoxon
rank-sum test) and absent in singly transgenic mice. Administering
doxycycline for 1 week to bitransgenic mice eliminated this
induction of suprabasal DNA synthesis. We also examined
the expression of MCM7, which we previously have shown is
up-regulated in the endocervical epithelium of K14E7 mice and
which is a marker in humans for high-grade cervical dysplasia and
HPV-associated cancers (26). In nontransgenic mice, cells staining
positively for MCM7 were restricted to the basal and parabasal
layers of the epithelium; in contrast, we observed the expression of
MCM7 throughout the full thickness of the endocervical epithelium
of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice (Fig. 3C). The pattern of
expression of MCM7 in singly transgenic Bi-L E7 mice and in
bitransgenic mice given doxycycline for 1 week resembled that seen
in nontransgenic mice.

treated for 6 months with estrogen developed cervical cancer,
and this proportion increased to 53% after 7 months. Both results
were statistically significant compared with nontransgenic mice
(P < 0.05, two-sided Fisher’s exact test). In all bitransgenic mice,
regardless of the presence of cancer, mid- to high-grade dysplasia
was ubiquitous throughout the female reproductive tract; statistically, this led to an increase in the severity of disease in bitransgenic
mice over what was observed in nontransgenic mice (P < 1  10 5,
two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Consistent with our prior
findings with K14E7 mice (10, 26, 29), these results indicate that the
expression of E7 in the female reproductive tracts of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice, in combination with estrogen, leads to the
development of high-grade dysplasia and cervical cancer.
Continuous expression of E7 is required for the maintenance
of high-grade dysplasia and cervical cancer in Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice. To evaluate the dependence of cervical
cancers on the continuous presence of E7, we treated a subset
of bitransgenic mice with doxycycline for the final month of the
7-month treatment with estrogen. By comparing the incidence of
cancers in this group with the two groups of bitransgenic mice that
did not receive doxycycline, we were able to determine the effect on
cervical cancers of turning off the expression of E7. As shown in
Table 1 and Fig. 4A, bitransgenic mice receiving 1 month of
treatment with doxycycline had no cervical cancers, indicating that
cervical cancers in these mice regressed after we administered
doxycycline. Furthermore, we observed a complete regression of
high-grade dysplasia in bitransgenic mice given doxycycline for
1 month (Fig. 4B), although in a subset of these mice we still
observed isolated CIN1 lesions. This was in stark contrast to
what we observed in bitransgenic mice not given doxycycline, where
we saw dysplasia throughout the female reproductive tract. To
ensure that these results were not due to an effect of the doxycycline
other than the silencing of the Bi-L E7 transgene, we treated a
subset of K14E7 mice with doxycycline for the final month of a
7-month treatment with estrogen and observed no difference in the
severity of dysplastic disease or the incidence of cervical cancer
between this group and a group never given doxycycline (Table 1).
To determine how quickly the dysplasia in bitransgenic mice
regressed once we administered doxycycline, we treated mice given

We also investigated whether Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice
displayed acute phenotypes in the dorsal skin, where their overt
phenotypes had been most obvious. As described fully in
Supplementary Information, in the dorsal skin of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
mice, we observed an induction of DNA synthesis in the suprabasal
compartment of the epidermis (Supplementary Fig. S3A, quantified
in Supplementary Fig. S3C), a disruption of epithelial differentiation (Supplementary Fig. S3B), and an abrogation of the response
to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (Supplementary
Fig. S3D), all of which we have observed previously in the epidermis
of K14E7 mice (9, 27, 28). In addition, all of these phenotypes in
bitransgenic mice regressed once we administered doxycycline for
1 week (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Taken together, these data indicate that Bi-L E7/K5-tTA
bitransgenic mice display an array of acute epithelial phenotypes
associated with the expression of E7 and that these phenotypes
regress on treatment with doxycycline.
Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice develop high-grade
cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer when treated chronically
with estrogen. We have shown previously that estrogen is a
necessary cofactor for the development (10) and maintenance (29)
of cervical cancers in K14E7 mice. Thus, to induce cervical cancers
in female Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice, we treated them for 6
to 7 months with exogenous estrogen. At the end points, we
sacrificed the mice, harvested and fixed the reproductive tracts,
embedded them in paraffin, sectioned them, and stained the
sections with H&E to allow us to score for the presence of
dysplastic disease and cancer. To do this, we categorized each
mouse based on the most severe state of disease observed. The
categories were nondysplastic hyperplasia, low-grade dysplasia
[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1)], mid-grade dysplasia
(CIN2), high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (CIN3/CIS), and
cervical cancer. The results are summarized in Table 1. As a
positive control, we treated K14E7 mice with estrogen for 7 months
and observed a 40% incidence of cervical cancer. In contrast, mice
that did not express E7—singly transgenic Bi-L E7 mice, K5-tTA
transgenic mice, and nontransgenic mice—developed nothing
worse than sporadic CIN1 lesions. When we examined tracts from
Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice, we found that 33% of mice

6 months of estrogen with doxycycline for 3 days. Even after this brief
treatment with doxycycline, we observed a complete regression of all
high-grade dysplasia in the reproductive tracts of female Bi-L E7/
K5-tTA mice (Fig. 4B), although cancers still remained (Fig. 4A). We
also performed immunohistochemical staining for BrdUrd (Fig. 4C)
and MCM7 (Fig. 4D) to verify that the expression of the Bi-L E7
transgene was silenced within 3 days of administering doxycycline,
and these results, coupled with the data from luciferase assays
(Fig. 1B), indicated that this was the case. In summary, these findings
show that both high-grade cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer
depend on the continued presence of E7 for their maintenance.
Mechanism of regression. Studies in tissue culture have argued
that suppressing the transcription of HPV oncogenes in cell lines
derived from human cervical cancers leads to the rapid induction
of senescence or apoptosis and halts cellular growth (20–24). In
addition, apoptosis and senescence have been observed within 1
to 8 days of inducing the regression of cancers in many other
animal models in which the expression of oncogenes or tumor

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

suppressors can be regulated temporally (14, 15, 18, 19, 30). In our
model, however, we were unable to detect an increase in
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4; data not shown) or an
induction of senescence-associated h-galactosidase (SA-h-gal)
activity (Supplementary Fig. S5) in either cervical cancers or the
endocervical epithelium after administering doxycycline to Bi-L
E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice for 1, 3, or 6 days following
prolonged treatment with estrogen. The explanation for the
observed regression of cervical disease simply may be that
silencing E7 leads to the restoration of the normal cellular
program for proliferation and differentiation (Fig. 4B–D), resulting in the elimination of high-grade cervical dysplasia and
cervical cancers; however, it remains possible that senescence is
occurring in our samples but is not manifesting as an induction

E7 in Persistence of HPV-Associated Cervical Disease

Discussion
The hypothesis that interfering with the expression of HPV
oncogenes might trigger the regression of HPV-associated tumors
has been bolstered by several lines of evidence obtained from
studying HPV-positive cell lines derived from human cervical
cancers (20–24). Although it has been shown in vivo that an
array of cancers requires the continuous expression of their
respective oncogenes for their maintenance (14–19), our results
(Table 1; Fig. 4A and B) are the first demonstration in the
context of an animal model that the expression of HPV E7 is
required for the maintenance of high-grade cervical dysplasia
and cervical cancer.
Oncogenic addiction, oncogenic amnesia, and HPVassociated cervical cancer. The hypothesis of oncogenic
addiction (31) asserts that the intracellular circuitry in cancerous
cells is altered significantly when compared with that of normal
cells. In the context of this altered circuitry, an oncogene may fulfill
a different and more important role than it does in normal cells;
therefore, cancerous cells become ‘‘addicted’’ to the presence of this
oncogene for their survival. Recently, the hypothesis of oncogenic
amnesia (32) was proposed to explain differently the reason that
tumors depend on the continuous presence of an oncogene. It
states that no single oncogenic lesion can inactivate all of the
checkpoints that regulate cellular proliferation and genomic
integrity; instead, a given oncogene will inactivate only some of
these checkpoints. Further genomic changes will continue to
inactivate additional pathways and eventually will lead to
carcinogenesis. As long as oncogenes are expressed, a cell remains
‘‘ignorant’’ of the further accumulation of genomic damage. Once
an oncogene is silenced, however, the pathways with which it
interfered become activated, recognize the genomic damage that
has occurred, and initiate a response—senescence, apoptosis, or
differentiation, depending on the reactivated pathways—to deal
with the accumulated genomic insults. Unless the pathways with
which the oncogene interfered become redundantly inactivated
genetically or epigenetically while the oncogene is expressed, they
will be reactivated on silencing the oncogene and will drive the
regression of tumors.
Although the hypotheses of oncogenic addiction and oncogenic
amnesia are not mutually exclusive and both have their caveats (31,
32), the assertions of oncogenic amnesia seem especially relevant
in the context of HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis. There is
an average latency of 15 years between infection with HPV and the
appearance of cervical carcinoma (33), suggesting that cervical
carcinogenesis results from the cooperation of HPV oncoproteins
with other genetic and epigenetic alterations. Whereas most
human tumors contain mutations in the p53 (34) or pRb (35)
pathways, these networks are unaltered in HPV-positive cell lines
(36); presumably, mutations in the p53 or pRb pathway do not
confer any advantage in growth to a cell in which these pathways
already are dysregulated by E6 and E7 and do not enhance
tumorigenesis. In fact, despite their aneuploidy (37), HeLa cells
retain functional p53 and pRb pathways, and on silencing E6 and
E7, both pathways are induced and can trigger an arrest in cellular
growth (38). Our immunohistochemical data show that the
expression of MCM7, an E2F-responsive gene negatively regulated
by pRb (39), is lost in suprabasal endocervical cells and in tumors
once E7 is silenced (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the pRb pathway
remains functional in the cancers and high-grade dysplasia arising
in Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice. Thus, oncogenic mutations
that cooperate with HPV to drive tumorigenesis spare the cellular

pRb and p53 pathways, and the reactivation of these pathways
likely plays an important role in mediating the regression of
cancers on the silencing of HPV oncogenes.
Regression of high-grade dysplasia on silencing E7. The
results presented here are the first to show in any context
that high-grade cervical dysplasia depends on the presence of
E7 for its persistence. The elimination of high-grade dysplasia
was complete after just 3 days of treatment with doxycycline
(Fig. 4B), although cancers still remained (Fig. 4A); thus, even
brief interference with the expression of E7 can cause the rapid
regression of high-grade cervical dysplasia, the development of
which generally requires several years (33). However, even after
the treatment of Bi-L E7/K5-tTA bitransgenic mice with
doxycycline for 1 month, sporadic CIN1 lesions remained in
about half of the mice (Table 1). Currently, it is unclear whether
these low-grade lesions represent remnants of high-grade lesions
that still are in the process of regressing, lesions whose
regression has stalled, or emerging E7-independent lesions that
potentially could develop into high-grade lesions and even
cancer. Determining the nature of these residual CIN1 lesions
will have important therapeutic implications.
Implications for the treatment of HPV-positive cervical
disease. Results from our (Table 1; Fig. 4A) and previous (20–24)
studies reinforce the notion that anti-HPV therapy that targets the
expression or function of E7 holds great promise for the treatment
of invasive cervical disease. Currently, the treatment of cervical
cancer often involves radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a partial or
total hysterectomy, which can be especially devastating for women
of childbearing age. The benefits of potential antiviral therapies
over these current methods of treatment, provided these therapies
have minimal side effects, are obvious.
Currently, the most common treatment for mid- to high-grade
cervical dysplasia—CIN2, CIN3, and CIS—is loop electrosurgical
excision procedure (LEEP; reviewed in ref. 40). Although LEEP does
not have deleterious effects on fertility, it does carry an overall rate
of complication of 9.7%. Although LEEP is considered very effective
for the treatment of CIN, the effectiveness is reduced for patients
who test positively for HPV DNA at follow-up and varies inversely
with the severity of dysplasia at the time of treatment. Our results
suggest that the development of antiviral therapy targeting the
expression or function of E7 may be a rapid and effective treatment
for HPV-associated high-grade cervical dysplasia (Table 1; Fig. 4B).
The benefits over LEEP of targeting HPV E7 potentially include
eliminating the need for surgery and its associated complications
to remove CIN lesions, increasing the effectiveness of treating the
highest-grade dysplastic lesions, and reducing the recurrence of
lesions if HPV DNA persists.
