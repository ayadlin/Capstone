Abstract
Cancer cells acquire drug resistance as a result of selection
pressure dictated by unfavorable microenvironments. This
survival process is facilitated through efficient control of
oxidative stress originating from mitochondria that typically
initiates programmed cell death. We show this critical adaptive
response in cancer cells to be linked to uncoupling protein-2
(UCP2), a mitochondrial suppressor of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). UCP2 is present in drug-resistant lines of various cancer
cells and in human colon cancer. Overexpression of UCP2 in
HCT116 human colon cancer cells inhibits ROS accumulation
and apoptosis after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents.
Tumor xenografts of UCP2-overexpressing HCT116 cells retain
growth in nude mice receiving chemotherapy. Augmented
cancer cell survival is accompanied by altered NH2-terminal
phosphorylation of the pivotal tumor suppressor p53 and
induction of the glycolytic phenotype (Warburg effect). These
findings link UCP2 with molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance. Targeting UCP2 may be considered a novel
treatment strategy for cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2813–9]

levels impede rapid flow of electrons along the respiratory chain,
facilitating escape of more electrons and formation of superoxide,
the primary mitochondrial ROS (6). Because proton leak decreases
Dw m and the rate of superoxide production, mitochondrial
uncoupling is a principal mechanism in the regulation of oxidative
stress (8, 9). Accordingly, uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), a widely
distributed member of the anion carrier protein superfamily
located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, is the major regulator of mitochondrial ROS (9, 10).
UCP2 expression correlates with neoplastic changes in human
colon cancer (11), and drug-resistant sublines of various cancer
cells also exhibit increased levels of UCP2, lower Dw m, and reduced
susceptibility to oxidative damage (12). Overexpression of UCP2 in
HepG2 human hepatoma cells lowers intracellular ROS levels and
attenuates apoptosis induced by various challenges (13). Thus,
whereas UCP2 is a marker of chemoresistance, expression of this
mitochondrial protein may facilitate cancer cell adaptation to
oxidative stress. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by
which increased UCP2 expression may promote cancer cell survival
are not known and have been examined here.

Introduction
Cancers are often exposed to adverse conditions such as nutrient
limitation, ischemia, hypoxia, host defense mechanisms, and
anticancer therapy. Cancer cells typically respond to these stimuli
by increased abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting
in oxidative stress (1). In this complex interplay, ROS promote
further genomic instability and stimulate signaling pathways of
cellular growth and proliferation. Paradoxically, ROS may also
initiate cell death pathways, if present in excessive amounts (2, 3).
The ability of cancer cells to regulate ROS levels greatly contributes
to autonomous growth, evasion of apoptosis, and other hallmarks
of adaptation associated with chemoresistance (4, 5). A better
understanding of how oxidative stress is controlled by cancer cells
is therefore essential to identifying new molecular targets for the
treatment of cancer.
Mitochondria are the primary source of metabolically derived
ROS (6). Substrate oxidation by mitochondrial respiration generates a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane
that establishes the electrochemical potential (Dw m). The energy
contained within Dw m can be either used for ATP synthesis
(oxidative phosphorylation) or dissipated as heat that is mediated
via proton leak in a process termed uncoupling (7). Elevated Dw m

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT29, DLD1, and
CaCo2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. p53 /
HCT116 cells and their wild-type isogenic cell line were a generous gift of
Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Cells were
cultured in McCoy’s modified medium (HCT116 and HT29), RPMI 1640
(DLD1), or Eagle’s MEM (CaCo2), all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (20% in case of CaCo2), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37jC, 5% CO2.
Plasmids and cell transfection. For UCP2 overexpression experiments,
human spleen total RNA (Ambion) was reverse transcribed and full-length
human UCP2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with sequence-specific primers
[forward, 5¶-TACAGGTACCATGGTTGGGTTC-3¶; reverse, 5¶-CTAAGCTTTCAGAAGGGAGCCTCT-3¶, containing restriction sites for KpnI and HindIII,
respectively (underlined)]. The double-digested cDNA was inserted into
pcDNA 3.1/Zeo( ) using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche). Successful
ligation of the full-length hUCP2 was confirmed by sequencing (W.M. Keck
Facility, Yale University). The same plasmid was used to generate a standard
curve in the real-time PCR assay. The full-length human TATA-box binding
protein (TBP) was cloned by a similar technique ( forward primer, 5¶-AGAACAACAGCCTGCCACCT-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-TTACGTCGTCTTCCTGAATCC3¶) and subsequently inserted into the pCR 2.1 vector. HCT116 cells (5  106
per reaction) were transfected by nucleofection (Amaxa Biosystems) using
2-Ag plasmid following the manufacturer’s instructions. The UCP2-overexpressing HCT116 stable cell line was generated by using 10 Ag/mL zeocin
(Invitrogen) in the culture medium for several passages, and colonies raised
from a single cell were analyzed for UCP2 expression by Western blotting.
Chemicals and UV irradiation. Camptothecin (CPT), doxorubicinhydrochloride, etoposide, carbonylcyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), oligomycin, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ala),

and routine chemicals were ordered from Sigma unless otherwise specified.
Camptothecin stock solution (2.5 mmol/L) was prepared in DMSO.
Doxorubicin stock solution (2 mg/mL) was prepared in water. Etoposide
stock solution (50 nmol/L) was prepared in methanol. FCCP (40 mmol/L)
was dissolved in ethanol and kept at 20jC until usage. Irinotecan (CPT-11;
Pfizer) was dissolved in physiologic saline (20 mg/mL). Cells were exposed
to UV irradiation essentially as described elsewhere (14). Briefly, cells were
washed thrice with PBS, which was then removed, and the plates were
irradiated for 15 min with 40 J/m2 intensity on ice using FB-UVXL-1000
cross-linker (Fisher), followed by overnight incubation at 37jC. Cell death
was assessed by cell cycle analysis.
Real-time PCR. The PARIS kit (Ambion) was used to isolate total cellular
RNA and protein from the samples following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The total RNA was reverse transcribed using First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche), and 5-ng cDNA was amplified with sequencespecific primers using iCycler iQ Multi-Color Real-time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad). Serial dilutions of the human UCP2 and TBP plasmids
were used to create standard curves. Thermal cycling conditions involved
45 cycles, with denaturation at 95jC for 15 s, annealing at 60jC for 30 s,
and extension at 72jC for 30 s, using 0.4 Amol/L of intron-spanning primers (UCP2, forward 5¶-CTCCTGAAAGCCAACCTCAT-3¶ and reverse:
5¶-CCCAAAGGCAGAAGTGAAGT-3¶; TBP, forward 5¶-CACGAACCACGGCACTGATT-3¶ and reverse 5¶-TTTTCTTGCTGCCAGTCTGGAC-3¶). Samples
were run in triplicates, normalized using their TBP mRNA content as
endogenous reference, and data were expressed in arbitrary units as relative
abundance of UCP2 mRNA over TBP.
Mitochondrial isolation and fractionation. Mitochondria were
isolated using standard protocol (15). Purified mitochondria were either
homogenized in cell disruption buffer (PARIS Kit, Ambion) and snap-frozen
for further use in immunoblot analysis or further fractionated using the
previously described digitonin/alkaline treatment (16). Briefly, 100 AL of
purified mitochondria were dissolved in 500 AL of digitonin solution
(1.2 mg/mL). After incubation on ice for 25 min, the suspension was
centrifuged at 10,000  g for 10 min to generate mitoplasts, which
consisted of the mitochondrial inner membranes and the matrix. The
supernatant contained the intermembrane space fraction and outer
membrane. For alkaline treatment, mitochondrial pellets were washed
and resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1 mol/L sodium carbonate (pH 11.5)
and subsequently incubated at 0jC for 30 min. The membrane fraction was
recovered by centrifugation at 100,000  g for 30 min at 4jC; the
supernatant represented the soluble fraction of the mitochondria.
Mitoplasts and mitochondrial membranes were reconstituted in cell
disruption buffer.
Antibodies and immunoblot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared in cell
disruption buffer (PARIS Kit, Ambion) supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Roche). For the detection of phosphoproteins, we used the
following lysis buffer: 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40,
10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L sodium fluoride, supplemented with protease inhibitors
(Roche). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA Protein
Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). Protein extracts were fractionated by 12% to
15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (PerkinElmer). Immunoblots were done with primary antibodies against UCP2
(C-20, Santa Cruz), p53, caspase-3 ( full), caspase-3 (cleaved), cytochrome c,
cytochrome c oxidase, Bcl-XL, and PUMA-a. Secondary antibodies were
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and immunoblots detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer). Equal loading was confirmed
with primary antibodies against h-actin (whole-cell lysates) or cytochrome c
oxidase IV (mitochondrial preparations).
Cell growth and cell cycle analysis. The numbers of viable cells were
determined by use of the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo). For cell cycle
analysis, 2  106 cells were collected and resuspended in 1 mL PBS, then
fixed in equal amount of ice-cold 100% ethanol overnight. The next day,
cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then centrifuged at 200  g for
10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of freshly prepared staining
solution [0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, 0.2 mg/mL DNase-free
RNase A (Sigma), and 20 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Roche)]. The cell

suspension was incubated at 37jC for 15 min and immediately transferred
to a flow cytometer (FACSort, Becton Dickinson). CellQuest software
(BD Biosciences) was used for data acquisition, and ModFit LT software
(Verity Software House) for data analysis.
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial
membrane potential (Dw m) was measured qualitatively using the lipophilic fluorescent probe 5,5¶,6,6¶-tetrachloro-1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Sigma). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates,
washed with PBS, and incubated with 6 Amol/L JC-1 for 30 min at 37jC.
Cells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and JC-1 fluorescence was
immediately measured in a SpectraMax M5 spectrofluorometer (Molecular
Devices). The ratio of red (530 nm) to green (590 nm) fluorescence of JC-1
was calculated for each well. To control experimental conditions, FCCP
(50 Amol/L) and oligomycin (10 Amol/L) were used to dissipate and
increase Dw m, respectively. Each condition was reproduced in at least six
wells for each experiment.
Measurement of whole-cell oxygen consumption. Cells were
harvested and resuspended in medium containing 125 mmol/L NaCl,
5.2 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L Na2PO4, 0.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 10 mmol/L dextrose,
and 10 mmol/L HEPES. Batches of 5  106 cells were placed in the chamber
of a Digital Model 10 polarography apparatus equipped with a Clark-type
oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers), and oxygen consumption was measured
for up to 15 min until the medium was depleted of oxygen according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Initial oxygen content was calculated to be
0.20625 mmol/L based on temperature, altitude, and osmolarity of cell
medium. Electrode potentials were recorded on a computer via an interface
system using Pico Log Recorder (Pico Technology). The rate of oxygen
consumption was calculated for each run, and each condition was repeated
at least in triplicate.
Biochemical assays. Cellular ATP content was measured with ATPlite
kit (Perkin-Elmer). Lactate levels in cell culture supernatants were
measured by Lactate Assay Kit (BioVision). Both ATP and lactate levels
were normalized to viable cell numbers.
DNA fragmentation assay. DNA fragmentation was assessed by the
accelerated apoptotic DNA laddering protocol (17) with slight modifications. Cells were homogenized in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
1% NP40, 20 mmol/L EDTA], pelleted at 16,000  g (5 min, 4jC), and the
supernatant was subjected to one round of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl
alcohol (25:24:1, pH 7.4, 0.5 mL) extraction. Apoptotic DNA fragments were
precipitated from the liquid phase by adding 50 AL of 3 mol/L sodium
acetate (pH 5.2), 1 AL of nuclease free glycogen (Roche), and 0.6 mL of
isopropanol. After incubation on ice for 5 min, precipitated nucleic acids
were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,900  g (10 min, 4jC). After washing
with 70% ethanol, the pellet was reconstituted in Tris-EDTA buffer and DNA
concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry. Equal amounts of
DNA were digested with RnaseOne (Promega). After digestion, 5 Orange G
dye was added to each sample and the apoptotic DNA fragments were
resolved by 1.8% Tris-acetate-EDTA agarose gel electrophoresis.
Annexin flow cytometry. To assess apoptosis by the appearance of
Annexin V on the cell surface, cells were washed with PBS, harvested using
0.25% trypsin (Sigma), and centrifuged at 500  g for 5 min. After repeated
washing, cells were resuspended in Annexin binding buffer and stained with
the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit #3 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were stained with 5 AL of
Annexin V conjugated with FITC (component A) and 1 AL of 100 Ag/mL
propidium iodide (component B). Following incubation for 30 min in
darkness at room temperature, the cells were immediately analyzed in a
FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Annexin binding and
propidium iodide internalization were quantified using FL1 and FL3
channels, respectively. A minimum of 10,000 events were collected for each
condition. All experiments were reproduced at least in triplicate using three
independent experiments.
Measurement of intracellular ROS. Cellular ROS generation was
assayed by using 2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCF; Invitrogen).
Cells were washed with PBS, harvested using 0.25% trypsin, centrifuged at
500  g for 5 min, and resuspended in PBS. Cells were incubated with
10 Amol/L DCF for 10 min at room temperature. Because DCF is unstable in

solution, a fresh 10 mmol/L stock was prepared for each experiment. After
staining, cells were treated with various agents and promptly analyzed
by flow cytometry using a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
A minimum of 50,000 events were collected for each condition and all
experiments were reproduced at least in triplicate.
Tumor cell xenotransplantation. HCT116 cells stably expressing UCP2
(clone ZU7) and empty vector controls (clone ZE12) were s.c. injected into
the lower flanks of NCr nu/nu mice (Taconic Farms) at a dose of 3  106
viable tumor cells. Mouse tumor growth was measured with digital caliper
and calculated by using the formula of a rotational ellipsoid: V = p/6 
A  B 2, where V is volume, A is the longest tumor axis, and B is the
perpendicular shorter tumor axis. In vivo chemotherapy with irinotecan
hydrochloride (CPT-11, Pfizer) was started after 2 wk once xenografts
reached an average volume of at least 100 mm3. CPT-11 was administered at
a dose of 25 mg/kg i.p. every third day for 2 wk. All animal experiments
were done in accordance to the institutional guidelines of Lifespan Animal
Welfare Committee of Rhode Island Hospital.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor xenografts were removed and fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS at 4jC, then
dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-Am thickness. Tissue
slides were stained with C-20 goat polyclonal anti-UCP2 antibody (1:100;
Santa Cruz), followed by biotinylated secondary horse anti-goat antibody
(1:500; Vector), and visualized with peroxidase (Vector).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SE and analyzed
with unpaired Student’s t test or ANOVA when multiple comparisons were
made. Differences with calculated P < 0.05 were regarded as significant.

Results and Discussion
UCP2 overexpression protects cancer cells from apoptosis
and oxidative stress. To examine the functional importance of
UCP2 in cancer cells, we have overexpressed the plasmid-encoded

cDNA of human UCP2 in HCT116, a human colon cancer cell line
with low endogenous UCP2 levels (Fig. 1A and B). Recombinant
UCP2 was synthesized at high levels and targeted successfully to
the mitochondrial inner membrane of HCT116 cells (Fig. 1C).
Consistent with increased uncoupling (9), UCP2-overexpressing
HCT116 cells displayed diminished baseline Dw m (Fig. 1D, left) and
increased oxygen consumption (Fig. 1D, middle), whereas their
intracellular ATP levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1D, right).
Because UCP2 has no apparent effect on net proton conductance
unless activated by superoxide or ROS-derived alkenals (9), these
findings affirm that baseline oxidant levels are sufficiently high to
activate plasmid-encoded UCP2 in HCT116 cells.
To determine whether UCP2 overexpression can block apoptosis
induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, we treated HCT116 cells with
CPT, a topoisomerase I inhibitor with derivatives widely used in the
clinical management of colon cancer (18). Such agents cause DNA
strand breaks and initiate a series of events that may contribute to
increased oxidative stress, culminating in cell death (18). Apoptosis
induced by CPT was markedly diminished in UCP2-overexpressing HCT116 cells as determined by Annexin V flow cytometry
(Fig. 2A, left) and DNA ladder gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, top right).
Furthermore, UCP2 overexpression in HCT116 cells resulted in
decreased cleavage and activation of the key apoptosis effector
caspase-3, increased abundance of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL
protein, and less expression of PUMA-a (Fig. 2A, bottom right), an
essential proapoptotic protein targeted by the tumor suppressor
p53 (19, 20). These data further indicate that plasmid-encoded
UCP2 confers resistance to HCT116 cells from CPT-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was similarly diminished in UCP2-overexpressing

HCT116 cells treated with two topoisomerase II inhibitors,
etoposide and doxorubicin, showing that the protective effect of
UCP2 is not limited to CPT and topoisomerase I blockade (Fig. 2B,
top). Moreover, UCP2 overexpression resulted in a 30% decrease of
apoptosis induced by exposure of HCT116 cells to UV radiation
(40 J/m2 for 15 minutes), indicating the ability of UCP2 to rescue
cancer cells from various types of cytotoxic injury (not shown).
Chemical uncoupling simulates the effect of UCP2 overexpression in cancer cells. Pretreatment with low doses of the
chemical uncoupler FCCP also protected HCT116 cells from
apoptosis induced by topoisomerase inhibitors (Fig. 3A). Because
FCCP is a pure protonophore, these findings support the role of
proton leak in the antiapoptotic effect of UCP2. The protective
effect of uncoupling was further shown by lower intracellular
ROS levels in HCT116 cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents
following either UCP2 overexpression (Fig. 2B, bottom) or
treatment with low-dose FCCP (Fig. 3B). Importantly, HCT116
cells had increased rates of cell death including necrosis when
exposed to FCCP at doses z5 Amol/L (Fig. 3A, left). In addition,
progressively lower cellular ATP levels were noted in cells exposed
to higher doses of FCCP before any further treatment (Fig. 3C),
indicating that excessive chemical uncoupling causes marked
energy compromise with loss of cytoprotection. In contrast, the
effect of UCP2 overexpression on baseline cellular ATP levels in
HCT116 cells was negligible at applied plasmid concentrations
(Fig. 1D, right). Altogether, the findings are in agreement with the
concept of limited or ‘‘mild uncoupling’’ as an important biological

mechanism (8, 9) and link the regulated mitochondrial proton
leak to the control of oxidative stress and apoptosis in cancer
cells.
UCP2 promotes in vivo chemoresistance in cancer cells.
Next, we analyzed the in vivo effects of UCP2 on drug resistance of
colon cancer cells. We generated s.c. xenografts in NCr nu/nu mice
by using wild-type p53 HCT116 cells that stably overexpress UCP2
(clone ZU7) compared with empty vector controls (clone ZE12;
Fig. 4A). Triaxial measurements indicated no difference between
spontaneous growth rates of xenografts containing cells overexpressing UCP2 and cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 4B).
Tumor growth markedly regressed in response to treatment with
the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT-11 in mice that received
xenografts of ZE12 cells. In contrast, UCP2-overexpressing ZU7
cells were much more resistant to CPT-11. These in vivo
observations provide further evidence that increased levels of
UCP2 augment chemoresistance in colon cancer cells.
p53-dependent protection of cancer cells from apoptosis by
UCP2. To investigate the link between diminished intracellular ROS
levels and cell death rates in UCP2-overexpressing HCT116 cells
treated with cytotoxic agents, we next examined the role of the
pivotal tumor suppressor p53 in this process. HCT116 cells possess
wild-type p53, which is a plausible target of UCP2 for several
reasons. As shown above, UCP2 overexpression results in reduced
expression of PUMA-a, an important proapoptotic effector of p53.
Furthermore, as recently proposed, ROS provide a major stimulus
to p53 stabilization and subsequent induction of apoptosis by a

addition of CPT for 24 h. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V staining (left), DNA ladder formation (right top ), caspase-3 cleavage (right middle ), and disappearance
of Bcl-XL (right bottom ). For additional details, please see Fig. 1. Note the increased number of cells staining for both Annexin V and propidium iodide in response

decreases of mitochondrial ROS levels by chemical inhibitors of
oxidative phosphorylation abrogate p53-dependent apoptosis in
human T lymphocytes and MOLT-3 leukemia cells expressing wild-

type p53 (22). To determine if inhibition of apoptosis by increased
mitochondrial uncoupling depends on the presence of p53, we

with CPT showed lack of G1-S arrest and lower rates of cell death
(P < 0.0001, versus wild-type), both consistent with augmented
chemoresistance in the absence of functional p53 (Fig. 5A).
However, diminished susceptibility to CPT in p53 / HCT116 cells
was not further altered by UCP2 overexpression [P > 0.05 (not
significant), versus wild-type], suggesting that cytoprotection by
mitochondrial uncoupling is not additive with the absence of wildtype p53 (Fig. 5A). Notably, UCP2 overexpression did not alter
CPT-induced activation of the G1-S checkpoint in p53 +/+ HCT116
cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that plasmid-encoded UCP2 interferes
with p53-mediated apoptosis but has no effect on p53-mediated
cell cycle arrest under these conditions.
UCP2 interferes with posttranslational modification of p53
in cancer cells. A well-recognized mechanism of p53 activation
involves phosphorylation of its NH2-terminal domain in response
to upstream stress signals (23). Rapid phosphorylation of Ser15 is
considered a ‘‘priming event’’ in response to genotoxic stresses (24).
This is followed by modifications that involve a number of NH2terminal p53 residues directly or indirectly responsive to oxidative
stress, including Ser33 and Ser46 by the stress-activated protein
kinase p38 (25, 26), Ser20 and Ser46 by protein kinase Cy (27, 28),
and Thr81 by c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (29). To explore links

between diminished ROS levels and p53-mediated apoptosis in
HCT116 cells, we tested the effect of plasmid-encoded UCP2 on
NH2-terminal p53 phosphorylation. We noted that phosphorylation
of p53 induced by 2.5 Amol/L CPT in UCP2-overexpressing HCT116
cells was markedly diminished at the designated Ser15, Ser33, and
Ser46 residues (Fig. 5B). Of note, total p53 abundance remained
essentially unchanged, indicating no apparent effect of UCP2
overexpression on p53 accumulation in response to CPT. These
data suggest that UCP2 inhibits apoptosis of HCT116 cells by
interfering with the ROS-mediated phosphorylation of p53 within
the transactivation domain. Further studies will be necessary to
identify UCP2-specific patterns for posttranslational modification
of p53 and the signaling mediators and other molecular partners
involved in this process.
UCP2 overexpression promotes the glycolytic phenotype in
cancer cells. p53 seems to be involved in the regulation of energy
metabolism, potentially via interactions with UCP2. As recently
reported, p53 stimulates mitochondrial oxygen consumption by
inducing the expression of SCO2, a subunit of the cytochrome c
oxidase complex that is embedded in the respiratory chain,
revealing a further novel mechanism for tumor suppression
(30). Furthermore, the product of another p53-inducible gene,

UCP2 and Chemoresistance in Cancer Cells

TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), lowers
the intracellular levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a key substrate
in glycolysis (31). Thus, p53 may compromise the Warburg effect, a
metabolic hallmark of many cancer cells (32) by increasing
oxidative phosphorylation, inhibiting glycolysis, and preserving
the balance between these two differing ATP-generating pathways.
Indeed, there is decreased oxygen consumption and increased
lactate production in p53-deficient cells (30). In line with these
observations, we found that HCT116 cells that stably overexpress
UCP2 produce progressively more lactate compared with empty
vector–transfected control cells in culture (Fig. 5C). Moreover,
treatment of UCP2-overexpressing HCT116 cells with the glucose
analogue 2-deoxyglucose, a potent inhibitor of glycolysis, results in
suppression of cell growth, consistent with increasing dependence
on glycolytic ATP production (Fig. 5D).

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that UCP2 modulates the cellular adaptive
response of cancer cells. Increased expression of UCP2 may provide

a marker of chemoresistance in p53-mutant cell lines (Fig. 1A) and
in the setting of neoplasia (11) of the human colon. We also show
that UCP2 seems to have an active role in promoting cancer cell
survival that is linked to mitochondrial suppression of ROS
production. Moreover, the antiapoptotic effects of UCP2 via ROS
involve modulation of the p53 pathway, a pivotal tumor
suppression mechanism. Finally, this interaction also affects the
balance of cellular energy production because UCP2 overexpression
preferentially induces the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells.
Altogether, the data identify UCP2 as a potential molecular target
of novel treatment strategies in cancer.
