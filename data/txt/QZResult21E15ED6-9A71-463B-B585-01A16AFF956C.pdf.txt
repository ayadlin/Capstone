Steroid induction of therapy-resistant cytokeratin-5-positive
cells in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer through a
BCL6-dependent mechanism

Therapy resistance remains a major problem in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive breast cancer. A subgroup of ERα-positive breast
cancer is characterized by mosaic presence of a minor population of ERα-negative cancer cells expressing the basal cytokeratin-5
(CK5). These CK5-positive cells are therapy resistant and have increased tumor-initiating potential. Although a series of reports
document induction of the CK5-positive cells by progestins, it is unknown if other 3-ketosteroids share this ability. We now report
that glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids effectively expand the CK5-positive cell population. CK5-positive cells induced by
3-ketosteroids lacked ERα and progesterone receptors, expressed stem cell marker, CD44, and displayed increased clonogenicity in
soft agar and broad drug-resistance in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of CK5-positive cells by 3-ketosteroids required induction of
the transcriptional repressor BCL6 based on suppression of BCL6 by two independent BCL6 small hairpin RNAs or by prolactin.
Prolactin also suppressed 3-ketosteroid induction of CK5+ cells in T47D xenografts in vivo. Survival analysis with recursive
partitioning in node-negative ERα-positive breast cancer using quantitative CK5 and BCL6 mRNA or protein expression data
identiﬁed patients at high or low risk for tumor recurrence in two independent patient cohorts. The data provide a mechanism by
which common pathophysiological or pharmacologic elevations in glucocorticoids or other 3-ketosteroids may adversely affect
patients with mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer. The observations further suggest a cooperative diagnostic utility of CK5 and BCL6
expression levels and justify exploring efﬁcacy of inhibitors of BCL6 and 3-ketosteroid receptors for a subset of ERα-positive breast
cancers.

INTRODUCTION
Estrogen receptor-α positive (ERα+) disease comprises 70–80%
of all newly diagnosed invasive breast carcinomas.1,2 Despite
widespread use of adjuvant anti-estrogen and chemotherapy,
approximately one in four patients with ERα+ breast cancer will
experience recurrence of therapy-resistant disease.3,4 Although
selection for cancer cells with genomic or epigenetic alterations
may underlie a portion of subsequent therapy-resistant disease,
recurrence of some ERα+ breast cancers may alternatively result
from the expansion of a pre-existing cell population that is
intrinsically resistant to adjuvant therapy.5 Tumor marker-based
classiﬁcation of ERα+ breast cancer into therapy-relevant subtypes
remains an ongoing effort. Protein expression phenotyping
of breast cancer includes hormone receptor status (ERα, progesterone receptor (PR)), Her2 status, proliferation status (Ki67) and
basal cytokeratin-5 (CK5) expression.6 Luminal A breast cancer
(ERα+/CK5-/Her2-/Ki67low) is associated with favorable outcome
with adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy. Luminal B breast cancer
(ERα+/CK5-/Her2 ± /Ki67high) confers poor prognosis but patients
do beneﬁt from anti-estrogen therapy. An emerging subgroup of
ERα+ breast cancer display predominantly ERα+/CK5 − cells and
mosaic presence of a subpopulation of ERα − /CK5+ cells, referred
1

to as ‘mixed luminal and basal’7 or ‘Luminobasal’ breast cancer.8,9
These tumors are thought to develop resistance to common
adjuvant therapies through expansion of the ERα − /CK5+ cell
population.8–10
CK5 is expressed in baso-luminal precursor cells of healthy
breast epithelia and is a commonly used marker for tumors within
the basal-like subtype of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but
has generally been considered absent in ERα+ breast cancers.11,12
However, 10–50% of ERα+ breast cancers contain a rare
population of CK5+ cells.7–9,13 This CK5+ cell population is further
enriched in ERα+ tumors of patients who have experienced
recurrence following chemo or anti-estrogen therapies.8,13 In
addition, in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the CK5+ cells
display reduced sensitivity to adjuvant therapy and increased
tumor-initiating potential,8,13 further supporting a role of CK5+
cells in the recurrence of ERα+ breast cancer. A series of reports
have established that PR activation expands the CK5+ cell
population in experimental models of ERα+ breast cancer.14–18
It remains unknown, however, whether related members of the
3-ketosteroid nuclear receptor family, including receptors for
glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and androgens, also stimulate
expansion of this therapy-resistant CK5+ cell population. In fact,
limited evidence has indicated that induction of CK5+ cells in ERα+

breast cancer is a unique effect of progestin (Prg) that is not
mimicked by other steroids, including glucocorticoids.19 The four
members of the 3-ketosteroid receptor family bind to overlapping
but distinct DNA response elements, are variably expressed in cell
populations, and interact differentially with co-regulators, thus
exerting both similar and distinct biological effects in breast
cancer cells.20–23 Due to the wide use of glucocorticoids for a
range of common conditions that frequently are comorbidities in
patients with breast cancer, their administration at high doses
with adjuvant chemotherapy to attenuate nausea and off-target
toxicity, as well as their frequent use in metastatic cases for
symptom management, we undertook a systematic analysis to
determine whether 3-ketosteroids other than progesterone could
expand the CK5+ cell population in ERα+ breast cancer.
The present study provides novel evidence that in ERα+ breast
cancer several 3-ketosteroids, including glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids, mimic Prg-induced expansion of therapyresistant CK5+ cells through a mechanism that requires the
transcriptional repressor and oncogene BCL6. The data are
supported by experimental studies of ERα+ breast cancer cell
lines in vitro and in vivo. Further clinical signiﬁcance is provided by
the strong association between early disease recurrence and
combined CK5 and BCL6 mRNA or protein expression levels in
patients with ERα+ breast cancer.
RESULTS
Glucocorticoid and aldosterone mimic Prg induction of a CK5+ cell
population in ERα+ breast cancer cell lines
Cultured T47D and MCF7 cell lines were stimulated with cognate
ligands for each of the four 3-ketosteroid receptor members,
including dexamethasone (Dex), aldosterone (Ald), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or Prg R5020, with 17β-estradiol (Est) and vehicle
included as negative controls. Dex and Ald increased the CK5+ cell
population in T47D and MCF7 cells four- to sevenfold as
determined by ﬂow cytometry (one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), P o0.0001 for both analyses; Figure 1a–d). Prg induced
CK5+ cells in T47D and MCF7 cell lines 12- and threefold,
respectively. DHT induced CK5+ cells threefold in MCF7 cells but
less consistently in T47D cells.
Immunocytochemistry validated the ﬂow cytometry data, as
Dex, Ald and Prg treatment markedly induced CK5+ cells in T47D
cells, whereas DHT or Est did not (Figure 1e), and Dex upregulated
CK5+ cells in MCF7 cells (Figure 1f). Induction of CK5+ cells
was positively associated with hormone receptor expression
levels, with Dex most efﬁcacious in high glucocorticoid receptor
(GR)-expressing MCF7 cells and Prg most efﬁcacious in high
PR-expressing T47D cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Dex-induced
CK5+ cells in both T47D and MCF7 showed saturable
dose responses consistent with receptor-mediated effects
(Supplementary Figure S2). Blockade of GR and PR by the
combined receptor antagonist, mifepristone (RU486), selectively
blocked the induction of CK5+ cells by Dex and Prg but not Ald in
both cell lines, consistent with nuclear receptor-mediated induction of CK5 (two-way ANOVA, P o 0.0001 for both analyses;
Supplementary Figure S3). In T47D cultures, CK5+ cells increased
over 6 days of Dex treatment and were preferentially expanded in
clusters, with clusters containing ⩾ 4 cells increasing after 5 days
(Supplementary Figure S4A–C). Faster induction of CK5+ cells
occurred in the more Dex-sensitive MCF7 line (Supplementary
Figure S4D), although induction of CK5 transcript levels was also
rapid in T47D cells (Supplementary Figure S4E).
Dex- and Ald-induced CK5+ cells display clonogenic and
therapy-resistant properties
To determine whether Dex- and Ald-induced CK5+ cells
display stem/progenitor-like features similar to those reported for
Oncogene (2016) 1373 – 1385

Prg-induced CK5+ cells, T47D cells pretreated with 3-ketosteroids
were seeded in soft agar and colony formation was monitored.
Treatment with either steroid induced a two- to threefold increase
in colony number (one-way ANOVA, P o 0.0001) and a 1.5- to
2-fold increase in colony size (one-way ANOVA, P o 0.0001;
Figure 2a–c). Previous reports demonstrated that in vivo-derived
Prg-induced CK5+ cells could be enriched based on their
co-expression of the stem cell marker, CD44.13,15 Flow cytometry
showed that CK5+ cells induced in T47D cell cultures by either
Dex, Ald or Prg in vitro co-expressed CD44, with CK5+/CD44+ cells
constituting 1.2% of cells in controls and 4.6, 11.0, and 3.9% in
Dex-, Prg- and Ald-treated cultures, respectively (Figure 2d).
Immunocytochemistry further showed that Dex-induced CK5+
breast cancer cells generally lack ERα and PR expression
(Figure 3a), similar to Prg-induced CK5+ cells.13 Dex- or Aldinduced CK5+ cells were resistant to apoptosis as revealed by
co-immunocytochemistry for CK5 and cleaved caspase-3 following
pretreatment with Dex or Ald for 3 days and subsequent
co-treatment with docetaxel (Doce) for 3 days. Image analysis of
co-stained cultures demonstrated that cleaved caspase-3-positive
cells (green) were signiﬁcantly less likely to be CK5+ (red) in both
Dex-treated (0.18% vs 0.01%; Paired samples t-test, P = 0.011) and
Ald-treated (0.91% vs 0.05%; P = 0.005) cultures with virtually
non-overlapping green and red pixels (Figure 3b and c).
If Dex-induced CK5+ cells are less sensitive to drug-induced
apoptosis, we expected that ERα+ cell lines pretreated with Dex,
followed by Doce, doxorubicin or tamoxifen (Tam), would become
enriched for CK5+ cells. Indeed, Dex-induced CK5+ cells were
further enriched two- to threefold in T47D or MCF7 cell cultures
following exposure to such adjuvant drugs (two-way ANOVA,
Po 0.0001 for both cell lines; Figure 3d–f). Drug-induced
expansion of the CK5+ cell population was also demonstrated
in vivo as T47D xenograft tumors developed Tam resistance
and showed marked enrichment of CK5+ cells relative to
control tumors (P = 0.004; Figure 3g; Supplementary Figure S5).
Collectively, we conclude that Dex- and Ald-induced CK5+ cells
display reduced sensitivity to adjuvant agents, similar to that
previously observed for Prg-induced CK5+ cells.
3-ketosteroid-induced CK5 expression in ERα+ breast cancer
requires BCL6
We recesntly reported that Prgs upregulate BCL6 expression in
several ERα+ breast cancer cell lines and that induction of BCL6
was required for Prg-induction of CK5+ cells.16 As observed for
Prg, western blots of whole-cell lysates revealed that BCL6 protein
was frequently upregulated by Dex, Ald and DHT, but not Est, in
ERα+ cell lines T47D, MCF7, BT474 and ZR75.1, but not in
ERα − cell lines SKBr3 or MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4a and b). BCL6
induction by Dex in MCF7 cells was detected at doses as low as
30 nM and persisted for at least 48 h (Supplementary Figure S6A
and B). Dex induction of BCL6 preceded induction of CK5, with
maximal levels of BCL6 detected within 8 h vs 5 days for maximal
emergence of CK5+ cells in the MCF7 cell line (Supplementary
Figure S6B and C). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
experiments demonstrated a positive association between induction of BCL6 and CK5 transcripts by individual 3-ketosteroids in
both cell lines, with Dex being most efﬁcacious in MCF7 and Prg in
T47D cells (Figure 4c and d). To determine whether 3-ketosteroids
generally require BCL6 to induce the CK5+ cell population, two
independent small hairpin RNAs in lentiviral vectors were used to
knockdown expression of both basal and 3-ketosteroid-induced
levels of BCL6 (two-way ANOVA, P o 0.0001; Figure 4e and f,
Supplementary Figure S7). BCL6 knockdown abolished induction
of CK5+ cells by Dex, Ald or Prg as determined by immunocytochemistry (two-way ANOVA, P o0.0001; Figure 4g and h).
As an independent strategy to test requirement of BCL6 for
3-ketosteroid induction of CK5, we used prolactin to suppress

an effective blocker of 3-ketosteroid induction of BCL6 protein
even at high steroid concentrations (Supplementary Figure S7D).

size (Figure 6c).
To determine whether prolactin treatment in vivo would suppress
3-ketosteroid induction of CK5+ cells, mice bearing T47D xenograft
tumors were treated with or without high-dose MPA in the
presence or absence of human prolactin for 18 days. Prolactin
co-treatment effectively suppressed the induction of CK5+ cells by
MPA (linear mixed model, Po0.0001) and attenuated MPA-induced
levels of BCL6 (Figure 6d and e), consistent with our in vitro
observations. Tumor size was not signiﬁcantly affected (Figure 6f).

Prolactin is therefore capable of attenuating 3-ketosteroid induction
of BCL6 and CK5 in ERα+ breast cancer cells in vivo.

Although ERα and PR were expectedly highly expressed in
Luminal A and Luminal B tumors, with Her2 highly expressed in
Luminal B and Her2+ tumors (one-way ANOVA, P o 0.0001 for ERα,
PR and Her2 analyses), GR was expressed in Luminal A and
Luminal B subtypes as well as the TNBC subtype, with modestly
lower levels in Her2-overexpressing tumors (least signiﬁcant
difference test, P o 0.05; Figure 7a, Supplementary Figure S9A).
Consistent with previous reports, AR was expressed in the ERα+
subtypes and to some extent in TNBC and Her2+ subtypes. Ki67
expression was highest in Luminal B and TNBC subtypes and
lowest in Luminal A subtype. Importantly, within the subgroup
of mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancers ERα and PR levels were

on CK5 and BCL6 expression will predict outcome in ERα+ breast
cancer. We ﬁrst used mRNA data from the publicly available Loi
data set29 that includes 170 ERα+, lymph node-negative patients,
with 85 Tam-treated patients and 85 untreated patients. Remaining known patient characteristics are presented in Supplementary
Table 2. Recursive partitioning of cases based on quantitative
levels of CK5 and BCL6 transcripts effectively separated favorable
and poor prognostic groups (Figure 7b; Supplementary Figure
S10A) that remained highly signiﬁcant after adjustment for other
variables in multivariate survival analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 4.34;
95% conﬁdence interval 2.06–18.39; P o 0.001; Table 1). Because
mRNA levels often correlate poorly with protein levels, we
examined BCL6 and CK5 protein levels in an independent cohort
of 170 ERα+, lymph node-negative patients, with 50 patients
(29.4%) receiving hormone therapy. Recursive partitioning of
cases based on quantitative levels of CK5 and BCL6 protein also
effectively distinguished favorable and poor prognostic groups
(Figure 7c; Supplementary Figure S10B) that remained highly
signiﬁcant after adjustment for other variables in multivariate
survival analysis (HR 5.23; 95% conﬁdence interval 1.89–16.37;
P = 0.004; Table 1). The high-risk group in the mRNA-based
analysis is made up of (1) high CK5 expression regardless of BCL6
levels, (2) the combination of low to moderate CK5 with
moderate-to-high BCL6 and 3) low CK5 expression regardless of
BCL6 levels. A similar pattern was found in protein analyses, with
high risk associated with (1) high CK5 expression regardless of
BCL6 levels, (2) high BCL6 in the absence of CK5 (l o 25%-tile of
expression) and (3) the combination of low CK5 with low-tomoderate BCL6. Although ERα+ breast cancer with high CK5
and/or high BCL6 intuitively ﬁt a mixed ERα+/CK5+ proﬁle, the
poor outcome in the fraction of ERα+ tumors with the very lowest
CK5 levels most likely reﬂects the Luminal B subclass.
DISCUSSION
The present study documents a previously unrecognized ability of
glucocorticoids and other 3-ketosteroids to expand a therapyresistant CK5+ cell population in breast cancer of the mixed
ERα+/CK5+ subclass. This represents a paradigm shift in terms of
the range of hormonal and pharmacological impact on mixed
ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer beyond what was previously thought to
be restricted to Prgs.19 The discovery of glucocorticoid-driven
expansion of the CK5+ cell population in mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast
cancer is of particular clinical relevance considering (1) the
widespread pharmacological use of glucocorticoids for common
breast cancer comorbidities, (2) the standard administration of
glucocorticoids to breast cancer patients who receive adjuvant
Oncogene (2016) 1373 – 1385

chemotherapy and (3) stress-related elevation of endocrine
glucocorticoids associated with a breast cancer diagnosis.
Glucocorticoids have been implicated in resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer as well as other solid tumors,30–32 and
stress-related elevation of endocrine glucocorticoids is associated
with unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer patients.33–36
Although glucocorticoids may promote therapy resistance
through multiple mechanisms, glucocorticoid-driven expansion
of a de-differentiated and hormone receptor-negative CK5+ cell
population may be particularly important for mixed ERα+/CK5+
breast cancer. As mineralocorticoid and androgen receptors are
expressed in normal and malignant breast epithelia,37,38 further
investigations of these 3-ketosteroids are warranted. Interestingly,
a randomized Phase III study of ERα+ breast cancer patients on
Tam revealed that co-treatment with the broad 3-ketosteroid MPA
signiﬁcantly worsened outcome.39 Additional clinical signiﬁcance
for a 3-ketosteroid receptor-BCL6-CK5 pathway was provided by
the discovery of a strong association between poor clinical
outcome and elevated CK5/BCL6 expression in ERα+ breast cancer,
associations that persisted in multivariate analyses with adjusted
HRs much greater than those observed in limited reports of CK5
expression alone.7,9,16 Thus, combining quantitative expression
levels of CK5 and BCL6 may have diagnostic utility for ERα+ breast
cancer.
Glucocorticoid-mediated effects on the CK5+ cell population
were consistent with that seen following Prg stimulation for all
readouts examined. The Dex-expanded CK5+ cell population was
characterized by enrichment of stem cell marker CD44, loss of ERα
expression, enhanced colony-forming ability in soft agar and
broad therapy resistance against several classes of drugs,
including the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin, the microtubule
disrupting agent Doce, and the selective ER modiﬁer Tam. GR
activation in mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer also replicated Prg
induction of oncoprotein and transcriptional repressor BCL640–42
prior to expansion of the CK5+ cell population. Upregulation of
BCL6 was required for CK5+ cell expansion by glucocorticoids, Ald
and Prgs based on BCL6 knockdown and effective downregulation
of BCL6 protein by prolactin. The results were validated in vivo
by the demonstration that T47D xenograft tumors grown in
3-ketosteroid-treated mice displayed markedly elevated BCL6
protein accompanied by expansion of the CK5+ cell population,
effects that were blocked by prolactin. Our data therefore indicate
that the 3-ketosteroid nuclear receptor family shares a common
mechanism for CK5+ cell induction in mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast
cancer that involves upregulation of BCL6. Future studies will
investigate three predicted glucocorticoid response elements

1383
the CK5 gene promoter that may mediate 3-ketosteroid-induced
expansion of CK5+ cells. It should be noted that 3-ketosteroids
induce BCL6 more broadly throughout the cancer cell population
than CK5, which becomes expressed only in a subpopulation of
cells. We hypothesize that BCL6-mediated upregulation of CK5
expression involves yet-to-be identiﬁed molecular intermediaries
that act on a select subpopulation of responsive cells. Two
alternative but not mutually exclusive possibilities are that (1) a
subset of cells intrinsically respond to BCL6 activation with CK5
upregulation, and (2) BCL6 induces paracrine factors to which a
subset of cells respond with CK5 upregulation. BCL6 is already
implicated in the promotion of breast cancer, as BCL6 attenuated
differentiation and blocked apoptosis in mouse mammary EpH4
cells,43 and BCL6 is elevated in high-grade and metastatic breast
cancers.24,25,44 Follow-up studies will determine whether BCL6
upregulation alone is sufﬁcient for expansion of the CK5+ cell
population in tumors of the mixed ER+/CK5+ subtype, and will
seek to extend the mechanistic studies from laboratory cell lines
to patient-derived xenograft models and murine genetic models.
The efﬁcacy of prolactin to abrogate expansion of the
de-differentiated CK5+ cell population induced by 3-ketosteroids
or chemo- and anti-estrogen therapies in ERα+ breast cancer is
intriguing, but is consistent with the established role of prolactin
in the maintenance of mammary epithelial differentiation.45–48
Loss of prolactin signaling may potentiate the emergence of this
CK5+/ERα − cell population in a subgroup of ERα+ breast cancers
through unopposed BCL6 activity and lead to therapy resistance.
Loss of signaling by signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5), a key mediator of prolactin signaling, is associated
with poor clinical outcome and increased risk of failure of antiestrogen therapy.45,46,49,50 Although prolactin receptor expression
is typically maintained or increased in breast cancer51 and may be
further boosted by co-recruitment of Jak1 in addition to Jak2,26
disruptive mechanisms underlying observed frequent loss of
prolactin receptor signaling include extracellular acidosis,52
elevated levels of the Jak2 phosphatase PTP1B53 or loss of
STAT5a protein expression or phosphorylation.50 Suppression of
prolactin signaling is potentially of particular relevance for mixed
ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer. These observations shed new light
on evidence that prolactin–STAT5 signaling inhibits invasive
features and maintains cell differentiation of some ERα+ breast
cancer lines.48,54
In conclusion, the new data broadly implicate receptors for
3-ketosteroids as drivers of expansion of the therapy-resistant CK5+
cell population in mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer. A common
mechanism involves upregulation of the transcriptional repressor
BCL6. The progress supports the concept that mixed ERα+/CK5+
breast cancers develop resistance to anti-estrogens and
chemotherapies driven by selective expansion of a CK5+/ERα −
subpopulation of cells. The observations provide rationale for
exploring 3-ketosteroid receptor antagonists or BCL6 inhibitors in
patients with mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer. Conversely,
progression of mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer may be promoted
by pharmacological agonists of 3-ketosteroid receptors or physiological or pathophysiological conditions (for example, stress,
pregnancy and endocrinopathies) that elevate 3-ketosteroids.
Finally, loss of prolactin–STAT5 signaling may directly contribute to
progression of mixed ERα+/CK5+ breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Cell lines were cultured as previously described.16,55 Media were changed
to RPMI+5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Philadelphia, PA, USA) 24 h before experiments. Cells were treated with
20 nM recombinant human prolactin (AFP795; National Hormone and
Peptide Program, Torrance, CA, USA), 1–10 μM Dex, 100 nM Ald, 10 nM DHT,
1 nM 17β-Est, 10 nM epidermal growth factor (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA),
© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited

20 nM R5020 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), and/or 1 μM RU486 (Sigma)
as indicated with fresh media every 3 days. Dex was applied at 1 μM for
MCF7 and 10 μM for T47D, as determined by dose response experiments.
For adjuvant therapy experiments, cells were treated with hormones
for 3 days before treatment with 10 nM Doce, 1 μM doxorubicin, or 1 nM
17β-Est+1 nM 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) for 3 days. Cell lines were
obtained from ATCC (authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat proﬁling and
conﬁrmed mycoplasma-negative) and cultured for o6 months.

Lentiviral infection
Lentivirus was produced as described previously.16 Cells were infected with
lentivirus overnight and allowed to grow for 48 h before hormone
induction for an additional 6 days.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays were performed as described
previously16,24 using corresponding primers (Supplementary Table S1).

Immunoblotting
Performed as described previously.53 Proteins were immunoblotted with
antibodies to phospho-STAT5 (#611964; BD Biosciences, East Rutherford,
NJ, USA), total STAT5 (#610192; BD Biosciences), BCL6 (#M7211; Dako,
Carpinteria, CA, USA), CK5 (#MS-1896-S; Thermo Scientiﬁc) or GAPDH
(sc-25778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), followed by
AlexaFluor-680-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) or IRDye-800-CW-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Licor, Lincoln,
NE, USA). Immunoblots were scanned using Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (Licor).

Immunocytochemistry
Performed as described previously.16 Primary antibodies to BCL6, CK5, ERα
(EP1; Dako), PR-B (#3157S; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), GR (#3660; Cell
Signaling), GATA3 (#5852S; Cell Signaling) or Cleaved Caspase-3 (#9661;
Cell Signaling) were applied, followed by AlexaFluor-555-conjugated goat
anti-mouse/488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen).
Images were captured using the OLY-100 microscope.

Flow cytometry
Cells were collected, ﬁxed, permeabilized and stained with FITCconjugated CK5 antibody (sc-32721; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and/or
PE-conjugated CD44 (#562818; BD Biosciences), run on a BD LSRII
instrument, and analyzed by FlowJo (Ashland, OR, USA). The CK5+ gate
was deﬁned for 1% of vehicle cells as positive and applied to each
specimen.

Soft agar assay
T47D cells were pretreated for 6 days and allowed to form colonies in soft
agar for 3 weeks. 10 images/well were analyzed using ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) for number and mean size of colonies 4600
pixels.

Xenograft studies
T47D xenotransplants were performed in immunodeﬁcient estrogenized
nude female mice (8–10 weeks old, 17β-Est pellets; 0.72 mg/90 days
release; IRA, Sarasota, FL, USA) as described previously.24 For the Tam
study, tumors growing in control-treated (n = 5) or Tam-treated mice (n = 5;
10 mg/90 days release; IRA) were harvested as indicated. For the Dex/MPA
studies, mice (n = 21) were randomized and implanted with Dex (1.5 mg/
60 days) or MPA (10 mg/60 days) subcutaneous pellets. Speciﬁed
randomized animals (n = 6) were injected subcutaneously with 4 μg/g
body mass of human prolactin biweekly for 3 weeks. Tumors from animals
that died were excluded from the analysis. All animal studies were
approved by Thomas Jefferson University’s IACUC.

Immunohistochemistry
Performed as described previously.16,24 Tumor sections were stained with
CK5 and BCL6, and images were taken at 20–40 × magniﬁcation using the
Olympus BX40 microscope and analyzed for percent area of CK5+ cells in a
blinded manner. A breast cancer tissue microarray representing an

unselected cohort of patients from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital
pathology archives under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols
was evaluated for nuclear or cytoplasmic BCL6, CK5, ER (#M7047; Dako), AR
(#MDR2044; Molecular Detection and Retrieval, Windber, PA, USA), PR
(#M3569; Dako), Her2 (#A0485; Dako) and GR immunoﬂuorescent staining
on 276 cases using an Autostainer Plus (Dako). High-resolution digital
images were captured at 20 × using Scanscope FL (Aperio, Sausalito, FL,
USA). Quantitative analyses for average staining intensity were performed
using Tissue Studio digital pathology image analysis software (Deﬁniens,
Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Statistical methods
Appropriate statistical analyses, post hoc tests and Bartlett’s test for equal
variance were performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria), SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism
software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All in vitro experiments
presented are representative and were replicated at least two times. Data
presented in bar graphs represent mean (n = 3) ± s.e.m. Sample sizes for
relevant experiments were determined by power analyses conducted
during experiment planning. CK5 and BCL6 mRNA expression data and
clinical annotations from Loi et al.29 were downloaded from the GeneChip
Oncology Database, which contained Affymetrix HG-U133A expression
data for ERα+, lymph node-negative breast cancers with focus on relapsefree survival and data from the BCL6 (X203140_at, X215990_s_at) and CK5
(X201820_at) probes. A breast cancer array with clinical annotation from
Thomas Jefferson University Hospital pathology archives focusing on ERα+,
lymph node-negative patients was developed and protein expression of
BCL6 and CK5 was quantiﬁed from immunoﬂuorescent staining analyzed
by Tissue Studio (Deﬁniens Inc, Munich, Germany). For each cohort, a
recursive partitioning analysis56 of BCL6 and CK5 expression data were
performed to determine marker combinations informative of relapse-free
survival, which was then incorporated in a multivariable Cox model
controlled for age at diagnosis, hormone therapy status, grade and tumor
size in the mRNA model, and age at diagnosis, hormone therapy status and
stage in the protein model. Bootstrap was completed around the recursive
partitioning and Cox modeling process. Conﬁdence intervals and P-values
for adjusted HRs are reported based on 2000 bootstrap samples. The R
packages, rpart, survival and bootstrap were used to complete survival
analysis.
