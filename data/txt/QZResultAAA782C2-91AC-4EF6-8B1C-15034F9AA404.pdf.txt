SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chromosomal translocations disrupting MLL generate MLL-fusion proteins that induce aggressive
leukemias. Unexpectedly, MLL-fusion proteins are rarely observed at high levels, suggesting
excessive MLL-fusions may be incompatible with a malignant phenotype. Here, we used clinical
proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and carfilzomib, to reduce the turnover of endogenous MLLfusions and discovered that accumulated MLL-fusions induce latent, context-dependent tumor
suppression programs. Specifically, in MLL pro-B lymphoid, but not myeloid, leukemias,
proteasome inhibition triggers apoptosis and cell cycle arrest involving activation cleavage of BID
by Caspase-8 and upregulation of p27, respectively. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition conferred
preliminary benefit to MLL-AF4 leukemia patients. Hence, feasible strategies to treat cancer-type
and oncogene specific cancers can be improvised through harnessing inherent tumor suppression
properties of individual oncogenic fusions.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During tumorigenesis, the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations is a key
mechanism that contributes to the malignant phenotype and is a hallmark of cancer
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Driver mutations appear important for tumorigenesis, and
tumor cells frequently develop dependence on select oncogenes during cancer evolution for
tumor maintenance and malignant progression, hence, develop “oncogene addiction”
(Sharma and Settleman, 2007). In several exemplary cases, oncogene addiction can be
broken by molecularly targeted agents aimed at therapeutic inhibition of the oncogenic
signaling pathway or the oncoprotein itself (Luo et al., 2009).

Classically known oncogenes, such as MYC, RAS, and E2F1, induce transformation and
promote tumorigenesis in various settings, but paradoxically incur cellular tumor
suppression responses, such as cellular senescence and programmed cell death. Highlighting
this phenomenon, MYC-induced lymphomagenesis depends upon an inhibition of apoptosis,
often through upregulation of pro-survival proteins of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family. Like
many oncogenes, MYC is not directly druggable, thereby posing challenges to cancer
therapy development. Intriguingly, tumorigenesis by oncogenes may involve cell-type
specificity and proper oncogene dosage (Lowe et al., 2004). Regarding oncogene dosage, for
example, whereas moderate MYC expression leads to transformation, excess MYC
accumulation triggers apoptosis. Thus, tumor suppressive surveillance may depend on a
threshold of oncogene abundance.

The Mixed-Lineage Leukemia gene (MLL) encodes a large, 500 kDa nuclear protein that
contains multiple conserved domains, including a SET domain endowed with
methlytransferase activity that is used to methylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a mark
associated with euchromatin and active transcription (Dou et al., 2006; Milne et al., 2002).
MLL functions as heterodimeric complexes composed of its amino (MLLN320) and carboxy
(MLLC180) terminal segments following site-specific proteolysis of its full-length precursor
polypeptide by the Taspase1 protease (Hsieh et al., 2003; Oyama et al., 2013; Takeda et al.,
2006; Takeda et al., 2013). Additional regulation of MLL function involves its biphasic
accumulation and proteasome-mediated degradation coinciding with the cell cycle,
coordinated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system E3 SCFSkp2 and APCCdc20 at S and M
phases, respectively (Liu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010). Interestingly, MLL is also subject to
proteasome-mediated degradation by the ECSASB2 E3 ligase (Wang et al., 2012).
Chromosome 11q23 translocations involving MLL account for ~80% of infant leukemias,
~10% of adult acute leukemias, and ~33% of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/
secondary acute leukemias (Liu et al., 2009). Leukemogenic MLL translocations fuse the
common MLL 5’ part that encodes its N-terminal ~1,400 aa in frame with more than 60
translocation partner genes (TPGs) (Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007; Liedtke and Cleary,
2009; Liu et al., 2009; Muntean and Hess, 2012; Yip and So, 2013). MLL translocations
involving fusion of chromosome 11 with chromosomes 4 and 19 resulting in MLL-AF4 and
MLL-ENL, respectively are prevalent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Bhojwani et
al., 2009) whereas its translocations with chromosomes 9 and 6 producing MLL-AF9 and
MLL-AF6, respectively, are commonly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

MLL-induced leukemias often show resistance to chemotherapies and consequently, patients
with these malignancies typically undergo rapid relapse following these conventional
treatments. The lack of adequate therapy for leukemias is likely due, in part, to the wide
diversity of TPGs and potent oncogenic capacity of MLL-TPG fusion proteins. Hence, much
remains to be learned about the activities of the MLL-fusion proteins.
Unexpectedly, expression of certain MLL-fusion products appears to compromise leukemia
cell survival (Ayton and Cleary, 2001; Caslini et al., 2000; Xia et al., 2005), and clinical
samples from leukemia patients rarely show high-level accumulation of these oncoproteins.
Here, we investigated the hypothesis that accumulation of high levels of endogenous MLLfusion proteins are detrimental to leukemia cell survival and proliferation.

RESULTS
MLL-Fusion Proteins Accumulate Upon Proteasome Inhibition

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We previously observed that MLL-fusion proteins typically do not reach excessive levels in
vivo (Liu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010), indicating that their high-levels may result in
undesirable cellular consequences. To examine this further, we monitored the accumulation
of MLL and MLL-fusion proteins upon proteasome inhibition in different human leukemia
cell lines, including pro-B MLL leukemia cell lines RS4;11 and SEM, and pro-B non-MLL,
i.e., without MLL translocation, leukemia lines JM1 and REH (Drexler et al., 2004) (Figure
1A). Before exposure to bortezomib, RS4;11 and SEM cell lines had detectable MLL-AF4
levels that were more abundant than MLL, which is consistent with the fact that MLL-fusion
proteins exhibit reduced turnover by the cell cycle dependent ubiquitin proteasome system
(Liu et al., 2007) and that MLL-fusions can reduce the levels of MLL (Liu et al., 2010).
Significantly, upon exposure to bortezomib, the levels of MLL and MLL-fusion proteins
increased in all tested leukemia cell lines (Figure 1B). In pro-B MLL leukemia cells, MLLAF4 levels rose over the duration of bortezomib treatment, and a similar increase of MLLAF9 was observed in treated myelogenous MLL cell lines THP-1 and NOMO-1 (Figure
1B). Furthermore, stability analysis demonstrated that MLL-AF4 has a longer protein halflife than MLL (Figure S1A). Therefore, MLL-fusion proteins in leukemia cells are
continually turned over and their levels appear restricted from reaching an overabundance.

Pro-B MLL Leukemia Cells Show Greater Sensitivity upon Proteasome Inhibition,
Exhibiting Apoptosis and G2/M Cell Cycle Block
Next, we investigated what effect bortezomib treatment has on MLL leukemia cells.
Importantly, the pro-B MLL leukemia cell lines RS4;11 and SEM showed a dosage
dependent reduction in cell viability (Figure 1C). The reduction in cell viability observed in
these lines was greater than that in non-MLL pro-B lines JM1 and REH cells (Figure 1C).
The IC50 of bortezomib was determined to be approximately 3 nM in both RS4;11 and SEM
cell lines, which was 10 times lower than that for the other cell lines tested (Figure 1C). This
difference in sensitivity to proteasome inhibition was confirmed with carfilzomib, another
FDA approved proteasome inhibitor (Demo et al., 2007) (Figure S1B). Interestingly, in
AML, MLL leukemia lines MV4–11, MOLM-13, NOMO-1, and THP-1 were similarly
resistant to bortezomib as non-MLL lines HL60 and U937 (Figure 1C). Notably, despite

displaying significant sensitivity to bortezomib, RS4;11 and SEM cells displayed equivalent
sensitivity as the other leukemia lines to common chemotherapeutic agents, including
doxorubicin (DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor), etoposide (DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor),
paclitaxel (microtubule stabilizing agent), cisplatin (DNA cross-linker), and dexamethasone
(corticosteroid) (Figures S1C–G). Thus, these pro-B MLL-AF4 leukemia cells do not have
an intrinsic cell survival impairment. We concluded that pro-B MLL-AF4 leukemia cells
display a selective sensitivity to proteasome inhibition.
We sought to better understand the susceptibility to bortezomib in the pro-B MLL-AF4
leukemia cells. Annexin V staining of RS4;11, SEM, JM1, and REH cells following
exposure to bortezomib confirmed that the pro-B MLL-AF4 leukemia cells were more prone
to undergo cell death than their pro-B non-MLL leukemia counterparts (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, cell cycle analysis demonstrated that compared to JM1 and REH, the RS4;11
and SEM cell lines displayed a reduction in the S phase and an accumulation in the G2/M
phase (Figure 2B). These cells also displayed a greater ratio of sub-G1 ploidy (Figure 2B),
indicative of increased DNA cleavage that associates with apoptosis. These results suggest
that bortezomib selectively induces apoptosis and G2/M block in pro-B leukemia cells
bearing the MLL-AF4 oncoprotein.

To investigate that MLL-AF4 could be involved in the bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity, we
performed shRNA-mediated knockdown studies. SEM and RS4;11 cells were retrovirally
transduced with a shRNA specifically targeting the junction sequence of MLL-AF4
(shMLL-AF4) or a control shRNA. While the control shRNA had no effect on bortezomibinduced killing, shMLL-AF4 led to a reduction in bortezomib-triggered apoptosis (Figures
2C and S2A, S2B). Furthermore, ectopic expression of MLL-AF4 in SEM cells appeared to
render increased sensitivity to bortezomib (Figure S2C). Conversely, since non-MLL pro-B
leukemia cells were less susceptible to the bortezomib-stimulated cytotoxicity (Figure 1), we
determined if ectopic expression of MLL-fusions in REH cells would alter their sensitivity
to proteasome inhibition. To this end, we generated REH cell lines stably transduced with
MLL-AF4, MLL-AF9 or MLL-ENL (Figure 2D). Remarkably, introduction of MLL-AF4,
MLL-AF9 or MLL-ENL caused REH cells to become more susceptible to bortezomib
(Figures 2D). Of note, reconstitution of the common MLL amino-terminus alone in REH
cells (Figures 2D and S2D) or MLL-AF4 or MLL-ENL in HL60 myelogenous leukemia
cells (Figure S2E) did not confer bortezomib sensitivity. Altogether, these results
demonstrate that apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition in the pro-B MLL leukemia
cells is likely dependent on the MLL-fusion proteins. They also suggest that distinct
leukemia cells are intrinsically equipped with an oncogenic fusion protein that could be
retooled as a self-destructive weapon.
Bortezomib Triggers Apoptosis in Pro-B MLL Leukemia through BID Activation
Multiple death stimuli culminate in the activation of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 cascade, resulting
in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and cytochrome c efflux into
the cytosol for caspase activation (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al.,
2009; Ren et al., 2010). To determine whether caspase-mediated apoptosis is involved in
bortezomib-induced cancer cell death, RS4;11 and SEM cells were co-treated with zVAD, a

pan-caspase inhibitor, during their exposure to bortezomib. Co-treatment of zVAD
efficiently reduced the number of Annexin V positive cells caused by bortezomib (Figures
3A and S3A). We next examined if anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BCL-2 or BCL-XL
could suppress this death. In RS4;11 and SEM cells, retroviral transduction of BCL-2 or
BCL-XL disrupted bortezomib-induced cell death (Figures 3B and S3B), indicating that
proteasome inhibition induces cell death through the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic
pathway. Consistent with these pharmacological and genetic evidences of apoptosis, RS4;11
and SEM but not JM1 or REH cells displayed cleavage of Caspase-3 and PARP (poly ADPribose polymerase) (Figure 3C). Thus, in pro-B MLL leukemia cell lines, bortezomib
induces mitochondrial apoptosis that can be blocked by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-XL.

Bortezomib has been reported to trigger apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells through both
NF-κB dependent and independent mechanisms (Adams, 2004; Cvek and Dvorak, 2011;
Hideshima et al., 2009). However, in RS4;11 and SEM cells upon proteasome inhibition, no
increase was seen in the levels of I-κB, a major regulatory protein of NF-κB complexes that
is controlled by stimulus-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 3C). This
suggests that NF-κB inhibition is unlikely to be the main mechanism underlying
bortezomib-induced apoptosis. The observation that bortezomib-induced apoptosis can be
inhibited by BCL-2 and BCL-XL indicates the involvement of mitochondrion-dependent cell
program. In response to death signals, activator BH3-only molecules, including truncated
BID (tBID), BIM, and PUMA, directly interact with BAX and BAK to induce a stepwise
structural reorganization and the ensuing oligomerization of BAX and BAK, leading to
MOMP (Cheng et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2010). To
interrogate further, we examined the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family
proteins-key players that integrate death and survival signals at the mitochondria (Cvek and
Dvorak, 2011; Fennell et al., 2008). In RS4;11 and SEM cells, but not JM1 or REH cells,
conversion of BID to tBID p15 was observed upon proteasome inhibition (Figure 3C),
suggesting that Caspase-8 is likely activated to cleave BID. BID normally resides in the
cytosol, and, once cleaved by Caspase-8 (tBID), translocates to the mitochondrion where it
activates BAX and BAK to induce cytochrome c release, serving as an amplification loop
for Caspase-3 activation. Caspase-8 can be autoactivated within the Death-Inducing
Signaling Complex (DISC) upon ligation of death receptors such as FAS. Indeed,
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of RS4;11 and SEM cells showed that bortezomib
increased transcript levels of FAS, FASLG, and CASP8, likely contributing to the activation
of Caspase-8, but not those of HOXA9 or MEIS1, two key downstream leukemogenic
effectors of MLL-AF4 (Figures S3C–H). Furthermore, bortezomib-mediated transcriptional
upregulation of CASP8, FAS, and FASLG was inhibited by knockdown of MLL-AF4 in
SEM cells (Figures S3I–K). Proteasome inhibition was reported to increase the duration and
amount of Caspase-8 activity upon death receptor engagement (Gonzalvez et al., 2012). To
further interrogate the involvement of Caspase-8 activation in bortezomib-induced apoptosis
in Pro-B MLL leukemia, we exogenously expressed CrmA, an inhibitor of Caspase-8
(Garcia-Calvo et al., 1998; Muzio et al., 1996), and found that CrmA expression
significantly protected SEM cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis (Figure 3D). As
previously reported, MCL-1 protein, which is rapidly turned over by the ubiquitinproteasome system, was stabilized by bortezomib (Figure 3C) (Perciavalle and Opferman,

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 April 14.

2013). However, the potent inactivator of MCL-1, NOXA, was also highly induced by
bortezomib (Figure 3C). Consequently, NOXA would prevent MCL-1 from sequestering
tBID, allowing tBID to activate BAX and BAK (Kim et al., 2006). Although both NOXA
and PUMA are known transcriptional targets of p53, only NOXA was induced upon
proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, the levels of p53 did not correlate with bortezomibinduced apoptosis in these cell lines that carry wild-type p53 alleles based on the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (Barretina et al., 2012) (Figure 3C). Hence, p53 is unlikely to play a
role in proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis at our experimental setting. Taken together,
these results are consistent with a model in which proteasome inhibition activates Caspase-8
to convert BID to tBID, which in turn, initiates BAX- and BAK-dependent mitochondrial
apoptosis in pro-B MLL leukemia cells
Bortezomib Induces Cell Cycle Dysfunction in RS4;11 and SEM Cells through p27
Activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because bortezomib triggers both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Figures 2A and 2B), we
examined whether these two processes are separable. First, we determined if the
bortezomib-induced G2/M block is affected when apoptosis is abrogated. For this, antiapoptotic BCL-XL was ectopically expressed in SEM cells to inhibit apoptosis. Despite
acquiring a marked resistance to apoptosis, the BCL-XL-expressing SEM cells still exhibited
a G2/M block upon proteasome inhibition (Figure 4A). Similarly, co-treatment of zVAD in
SEM cells did not impact the G2/M block caused by bortezomib (Figure S4A). To further
investigate, we performed immunoblotting to detect levels of cyclins and cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), key regulators of cell cycle progression. In RS4;11 and SEM
cells, we observed a marked upregulation of p27 that correlated with the bortezomibinduced cell cycle arrest (Figure 4B). In contrast, the levels of p15, p16, p21, Cyclins D1,
E2, A, B1, were unchanged by bortezomib, and hence these were unlikely to be directly
involved in the bortezomib-induced cell cycle arrest (Figure 4B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined the role of p27 in the bortezomib-induced G2/M block. In SEM-BCL-2
cells, knockdown of p27 led to an attenuation of the bortezomib-induced G2/M block
(Figure 4C), indicating that p27 is important for these pro-B MLL leukemia cells to undergo
cell cycle arrest in response to proteasome inhibition. Levels of p27 can be controlled by
protein degradation (Chu et al., 2008) and by direct transcriptional activation through MLL
and MLL-AF4 (Milne et al., 2005; Xia et al., 2005). Thus, we examined if the upregulation
of p27 upon bortezomib treatment depends on MLL-AF4. qRT-PCR analysis showed that
the p27 mRNA level in SEM and RS4;11 but not JM1 or REH cells was increased by the
bortezomib treatment (Figure 4D). Significantly, in SEM cells, specific knockdown of
MLL-AF4 impeded p27 induction (Figure 4E). Conversely, enforced expression of MLLAF4 or MLL-AF9 in REH cells rendered capability to upregulate p27 (Figure 4F). Taken
together, these results suggest that bortezomib principally stabilizes MLL-AF4 or MLLAF9, which in turn activates the transcription of the p27 gene (CDKN1B). Similarly,
knockdown of MLL-AF4 in RS4;11 cells also compromised p27 induction but to a lesser
degree, which could be due to a less efficient knockdown (Figure S4B). Intriguingly,
concurrent knockdown of both MLL-AF4 and MLL by targeting the shared amino-terminus
(shMLL-N) in RS4;11 cells seemed to further impair the p27 induction upon the bortezomib

treatment, implicating a possible assistance of MLL in the MLL-AF4-dependent induction
of p27 (Figure S4B), reminiscent of what was shown before that MLL-AF9-induced
leukemogenesis required MLL (Thiel et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further evaluated the mechanisms by which MLL-fusion proteins contribute to the p27
upregulation. Interestingly, MLL-fusion partner proteins, including AF4, AF9, ENL, and
ELL, are functional components of the P-TEFb complex (Positive Transcription Elongation
Factor b) that functions in transcriptional elongation (Mohan et al., 2010). Moreover, MLLAF4, but not MLL, is able to recruit P-TEFb (Yokoyama et al., 2010). Therefore, we
examined whether the bortezomib-stabilized MLL-AF4 recruits P-TEFb to enhance
CDKN1B transcription. To this end, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays. In bortezomib treated REH and SEM cells, anti-MLL N-terminus antibody detected
an increased occupancy of MLL and/or MLL-AF4 at both the CDKN1B promoter and exon
2 (Figure 4G). Of note, this N-terminus antibody recognizes both MLL and MLL-fusions
(Liu et al., 2010). Like the MLL-AF4 protein, Cyclin T1, a key component of the P-TEFb
complex (Mohan et al., 2010), was also observed to have an increased promoter and gene
body occupancy in SEM but not REH cells (Figures 4G). Altogether, the body of evidence
indicates that accumulation of MLL-AF4 in response to bortezomib leads to recruitment of
the P-TEFb complex to promote transcriptional processivity along CDKN1B, thereby
increasing the production of p27 mRNA.
MLL-fusions Target the CDKN1B Locus through Binding B Cell Specific Transcription
Factor PAX5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recruitment of the P-TEFb complex to the CDKN1B locus by MLL-AF4 could explain how
MLL-fusion proteins might stimulate the induction of p27. However, it could not explain
why these MLL-fusions did not induce p27 in AML cells despite similarly increased protein
abundance. MLL and MLL-fusion proteins do not consist of any apparent sequence-specific
DNA binding domain (Liu et al., 2009). Therefore, we envisioned that MLL-fusion proteins
may upregulate CDKN1B transcription through DNA binding protein partners, such as
PAX5 and EBF1 (early B cell factor) transcription factors, that are selectively expressed in
pro-B cells (Busslinger, 2004). By co-immunoprecipitation assays, MLL-AF4 was found to
interact with PAX5, but not EBF1 (Figures 5A and S5A). Other MLL-fusion proteins,
including MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, and MLL-ELL, also interacted with PAX5 (Figure 5B),
suggesting that the PAX5-interaction domain of the MLL-fusion proteins is located within
the common MLL N-terminal 1,400 amino acids. Indeed, while the different MLL
translocation partners failed to pull down PAX5 by themselves, the amino-terminus 1,400
amino acids of MLL was sufficient to pull down PAX5 (Figure S5B). Mapping experiments
using individual MLL fragments demonstrated that the minimal interaction domain of MLL
encompasses the first 400 amino acids (Figure 5C).
Using JM1, REH, RS4;11, and SEM pro-B leukemia cells, we confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays that endogenous MLL/MLL-AF4 interacted with PAX5 (Figure
5D). Functionally, in SEM cells, knockdown of PAX5 abrogated the ability of bortezomib to
induce p27 mRNA and protein (Figures 5E, 5F and S5C). Furthermore, PAX5 knockdown
did not affect MLL-AF4 stability (Figure 5F). We noted that PAX5 levels increased upon

bortezomib treatment (Figure S5D), and this increase was also associated with an increased
PAX5 occupancy at the CDKN1B promoter (Figure 5G). Moreover, the increased abundance
of MLL/MLL-AF4 at the CDKN1B promoter was lost when PAX5 was knocked down
(Figure 5G), indicating that PAX5 is required for MLL/MLL-AF4 to bind the CDKN1B
promoter. Our collective data support a model in which the MLL-AF4 recruitment to the
CDKN1B locus depends on PAX5, and the interaction between MLL-AF4 and PAX5
enhances transcriptional processivity of CDKN1B, resulting in the cell cycle arrest.
Since PAX5 appears to be the critical link for recruiting the MLL fusion protein to the
promoters of cell cycle genes such as CDKN1B, we assessed the effect of enforced PAX5
expression in THP-1 cells an acute myelogenous MLL leukemia cell line. Interestingly,
introduction of exogenous PAX5 did not restore the sensitivity of the MLL-AF9-harboring
THP-1 cells to the proteasome inhibitors (Figures S5E and S5F). Furthermore, ChIP assays
revealed that neither ectopically expressed PAX5 nor MLL or MLL fusion proteins could be
recruited to the CDKN1B promoter (Figure S5G), suggesting that additional factors and/or
the epigenetic status of the CDKN1B locus unique to pro-B leukemia cells are likely
required for the recruitment of the PAX5/MLL-fusion complex to it.

Preclinical and Clinical Evidence Supports a Role of Proteasome Inhibition in Treating ProB MLL Leukemias

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate if the anti-cancer effects of proteasome inhibitors on pro-B MLL-leukemias
extend to in vivo settings, we performed xenograft studies by transplanting luciferase-GFPtagged REH or SEM cells into NOD-scid Il2rg−/− (NSG) recipient mice. Subsequently,
engrafted mice were treated with bortezomib (Luker et al., 2003) and monitored by
bioluminescent imaging over approximately 3 weeks. Mice transplanted with REH or SEM
cells without bortezomib therapy developed rapid tumor progression that was apparent 10
days after transplantation and that aggressively pervaded nearly the whole animal over the
ensuing 7 days (Figure 6A). Importantly, mice engrafted with SEM cells and then treated
with bortezomib showed a striking resistance to leukemia accumulation and had only a
minor detectable tumor burden during the same assay period, thus suggesting significant
bortezomib responsiveness in vivo. In contrast, mice transplanted with REH showed little
responsiveness to this form of therapy, and displayed a significant tumor burden (Figure
6A). Hence, similar to the results obtain from our in vitro studies, our xenograft studies
strongly suggested that bortezomib treatment is an effective agent against pro-B MLL-AF4
leukemia cells in vivo.
Leukemia patients bearing MLL translocations generally have a poor overall prognosis, and
this aggressive disease tends to be refractory to conventional anti-cancer therapies (Liedtke
and Cleary, 2009). Indeed, MLL leukemia patients frequently suffer relapse after high dose
chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation. Regrettably, those who fail to respond to
standard therapeutic regimens are often left with limited medical options. Few clinical trials
exist due to the low overall prevalence of adult MLL-fusion leukemias. A group of five
adult MLL leukemia patients, comprised of two pro-B, one bi-phenotypic, and two myeloid
leukemia cases, were compassionately treated with bortezomib at standard dosing
recommended for multiple myeloma (Figure 6B and Table S1). Remarkably, patient #1, a 21

year-old female with pro-B MLL-AF4 leukemia achieved a complete cytogenetic remission
after two standard cycles of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 day
cycle) (Figure 6C). Due to neurotoxicity, she was administered with reduced doses of
bortezomib at 1 mg/m2 given once a week as maintenance and which was discontinued after
8 weeks. This patient remained in complete remission without further treatment for more
than one year. Unfortunately, her leukemia eventually re-emerged and was minimally
responsive to bortezomib, and she passed way soon thereafter. She had previously relapsed 6
months after allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a matched unrelated donor following
Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy. Patient #2, another pro-B MLL-AF4 patient, exhibited
nondurable hematologic improvement. Patient #3, a biphenotypic MLL leukemia patient,
experienced nondurable reduction in bone marrow blasts. Consistent with our preclinical
findings showing that bortezomib has no efficacy on myelogenous MLL leukemia cells,
patients #4 and #5 derived no clinical benefit from bortezomib therapy.

DISCUSSION

Oncogenes, such as MYC, RAS, and E2F1, underlie various human malignancies and
promote cancer formation in various experimental settings. Yet, despite acting as important
drivers of tumorigenesis, these oncogenes can trigger tumor suppression in a cell-context
and dose-dependent manner (Lowe et al., 2004). Indeed, while moderate oncogene levels
induce cancer initiation and maintenance, high-level expression can inadvertently activate
tumor suppression surveillance programs including programmed cell death (Murphy et al.,
2008; Sarkisian et al., 2007). Most notably, excessive Myc overexpression, in a titratable
Myc mouse model, triggers apoptosis through the induction of BIM and PUMA, “activator”
BH3-only molecules (Egle et al., 2004; Hemann et al., 2005; Hemann et al., 2004). Hence,
this mechanism serves as a powerful way to curb the emergence of cancer and acts as an
organismal protective mechanism (Pelengaris et al., 2002). Similarly, E2F1-induced
oncogenesis is antagonized by apoptosis in RB deficient cancer cells (Chen et al., 1999;
Mendoza et al., 2003). However, while oncogenes can activate tumor suppression programs,
it remains undetermined if such latent programs persist in tumor cells, and whether they can
be reactivated and thereby render clinical benefit for cancer patients. There are obvious
important issues limiting this application. First, in many cancers, driver oncogenes are
overexpressed. Second, during tumor progression, cancer cells usually acquire additional
mutations that either abolish or bypass inherent tumor suppression functions. Third, ideal
targets should be different between cancer and surrounding normal cells. Here, we
demonstrate that MLL-fusion proteins can be stabilized and reactivated upon proteasome
inhibition, triggering latent tumor suppression programs (Figure 7).
The transcriptional regulation of p27 by MLL, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL has
been reported in various experimental settings and appears to be very complex (Caslini et
al., 2000; Milne et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2005). Intriguingly, in Jurkat cells
overexpression of MLL-AF4 induces p27 whereas in 293T cells it suppresses (Xia et al.,
2005). Furthermore, in human MLL-AF5 leukemia cells KP-L-RY and MLL-ENLtransformed murine myeloid progenitors pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 induces p27
and yields preclinical therapeutic benefits (Wang et al., 2008). In U937 cells, overexpression
of the MLL amino-terminus (aa 1–410) induces p27 (Caslini et al., 2000). In pancreatic

neuroendocrine cells and transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type MLL
complexes with Menin to suppress p27 (Milne et al., 2005), which further refines the Meninp27 tumor suppressor axis in the pancreas (Karnik et al., 2005). Surprisingly, although the
loss of Menin in MLL-ENL transformed myeloid leukemia blasts results in reduced Hoxa7
and Hoxa9 expression and thus compromises the leukemia phenotype, the Menin loss under
this experimental setting did not induce Cdkn1b (Yokoyama et al., 2005). Taken together,
most data including ours favors a positive correlation between MLL/MLL-fusion and p27
expression. This begs several outstanding questions: First, why do leukemia fusions activate
p27? Is this a necessity or simply an unwanted byproduct? In favor of the first scenario, it
has been suggested that low level of p27 induction by MLL-fusion proteins might prevent
leukemia initiating cells from exhaustion (Zhang et al., 2013). In favor of the second
scenario, MLL-fusions unavoidably acquire this context-dependent tumor suppressor
activity through the common MLL amino-terminus. Nevertheless, this capacity appears
tightly regulated and can be manipulated by pharmacological means, thereby offering
specific therapeutic benefits to pro-B MLL leukemia patients.

Collectively, these in vitro results suggest that the latent tumor suppression activity of MLLfusion proteins in pro-B MLL leukemia cells can be activated by proteasome inhibitors. In
accordance with our in vitro results, proteasome inhibition rendered therapeutic benefit in an
MLL leukemia xenograft mouse model. Proteasome inhibition also rendered complete
remission to one pro-B MLL-AF4 leukemia patient whose disease eventually relapsed.
Bortezomib treatment did not appear to benefit the three AML MLL patients. Notably, in
multiple myeloma, a malignancy for which bortezomib is approved, the rate of response to
bortezomib was found to be 38% (Richardson et al., 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

How pro-B MLL leukemia cells display differential sensitivity and acquire resistance to
proteasome inhibition warrant future investigation. Since overexpression of BCL-2 or BCLXL can abrogate bortezomib-induced apoptosis, apoptosis resistance might represent one
refractory mechanism. To overcome resistance, the potential clinical administration of
proteasome inhibitors in combination with other anti-cancer agents, such as cell death based
agents including ABT-263 (Tse et al., 2008), warrant further investigation. ABT-263, a
small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, is in clinical trials and has shown effectiveness and
selectivity against certain types of cancers (Davids and Letai, 2012; Walensky, 2012). In
conclusion, our findings reveal latent tumor suppression programs that can be aroused
through hyperactivating oncogenic fusion proteins. This arousal might be suitably exploited
as a cancer-specific therapeutic strategy.

Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). One million luciferase-expressing cells were
intravenously injected via the tail vein into NSG mice. NSG mice were then administered
intravenously with bortezomib at 0.5 mg/kg on a twice weekly schedule beginning two days
after the xenograft. Total body bioluminescence was quantified as previously described
(Luker et al., 2003). All animal work was performed in accordance with a protocol approved
by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University in St. Louis.
Statistics
The Student t test was used to analyze the differences between the groups. A p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Patients

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Retrospective chart review was performed to identify adult MLL leukemia patients who
were treated with bortezomib at the Barnes Jewish Hospital, Washington University in St.
Louis, between 2007 and 2010. Institutional Review Board approval for the retrospective
data collection was not required. Patients provided verbal consent for the off-label, offprotocol use of bortezomib for MLL leukemia patients who failed standard of care therapies.
Medical decisions were made at the discretion of the patients' physicians.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The oncogene addiction hypothesis posits that cancers driven by select oncogenes are
vulnerable to therapeutic inhibition of the culprit oncoprotein. Surprisingly, recent studies
have demonstrated that oncogenes have cryptic intrinsic tumor suppression activity that
requires downregulation for tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated whether MLL-fusions
possess latent tumor suppression activity and if so, could it be redirected to inflict selfdestruction. Indeed, we found pro-B MLL leukemia cells were sensitive to bortezomib
and carfilzomib. We treated five MLL leukemia patients who failed standard therapies
with bortezomib, we observed complete remission in one patient and hematological
improvement in another, both had pro-B leukemia. Our study supports further
exploration of latent tumor suppression properties of individual oncogenes for cancer
treatment.
