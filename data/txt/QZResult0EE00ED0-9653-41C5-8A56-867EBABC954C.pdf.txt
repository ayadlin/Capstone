Abstract
The clinical experimental agent, β-lapachone (β-lap; Arq 501), can act as a potent radiosensitizer in vitro
through an unknown mechanism. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism to determine whether β-lap may
warrant clinical evaluation as a radiosensitizer. β-Lap killed prostate cancer cells by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) metabolic bioactivation, triggering a massive induction of reactive oxygen species, irreversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSB), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) hyperactivation, NAD+/ATP
depletion, and μ-calpain–induced programmed necrosis. In combination with ionizing radiation (IR), β-lap
radiosensitized NQO1+ prostate cancer cells under conditions where nontoxic doses of either agent alone
achieved threshold levels of SSBs required for hyperactivation of PARP-1. Combination therapy significantly
elevated SSB level, γ-H2AX foci formation, and poly(ADP-ribosylation) of PARP-1, which were associated with
ATP loss and induction of μ-calpain–induced programmed cell death. Radiosensitization by β-lap was blocked
by the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol or the PARP-1 inhibitor DPQ. In a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer, β-lap synergized with IR to promote antitumor efficacy. NQO1 levels were elevated in ∼60% of human
prostate tumors evaluated relative to adjacent normal tissue, where β-lap might be efficacious alone or in
combination with radiation. Our findings offer a rationale for the clinical utilization of β-lap (Arq 501) as a
radiosensitizer in prostate cancers that overexpress NQO1, offering a potentially synergistic targeting strategy
to exploit PARP-1 hyperactivation. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8088–96. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer
in men in the United States. It occurs with the highest incidence (25%) of all cancers and is the second leading cause of
cancer-related death in men (1). Radiation therapy [X-ray
therapy (XRT)] using fractionated low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) is the most heavily used therapeutic method for
treating primary prostate cancers. However, traditional external beam fractionated XRT using total IR doses of <68
Gy have only limited curative potential for locally advanced
stages of prostate cancer, with a high (∼70%) 5-year relapse
rate (2). These lower doses are not efficacious for treating
prostate cancer due to intrinsic radioresistance (3, 4), whereAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1 Pharmacology, 2 Radiation

as accumulated high doses of IR cause severe side effects,
such as urinary and bowel dysfunction, erectile dysfunction,
and infertility. These complications are caused by damage to
surrounding normal tissue by surgery, XRT, and/or chemotherapies as a result of the lack of tumor selectivity. Efficacious and tumor-selective synergistic strategies for treating
human prostate cancers are in great demand.
β-Lapachone (β-lap; 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho
[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione; also known as Arq 501), a novel antitumor quinone, has shown promise alone as a tumor-selective
chemotherapeutic agent in cancers that overexpress endogenous NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1; E.C.
1.6.99.2), a two-electron oxidoreductase. We previously
showed that NQO1 metabolized β-lap through a futile cycle,
with the parent quinone converted to a highly unstable hydroquinone form, utilizing dramatic levels of NAD(P)H. As a result, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are created,
causing DNA lesions in NQO1+ cells (5–7). At LD90 and higher
doses of β-lap (≥4 μmol/L), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
(PARP-1), a DNA damage sensor, is hyperactivated and extensive NAD+/ATP depletion ensues. PARP-1 hyperactivation required rapid Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores,
a result of ROS formation (8). Subsequently, loss of NAD+/ATP
results in influx of Ca2+, leading to the activation and nuclear
translocation of μ-calpain. Activation of μ-calpain causes a
unique caspase-independent programmed necrotic cell death
(8, 9). Importantly, β-lap killing of cancer cells is NQO1 specific and independent of cell cycle status, caspase activities, and

Radiosensitization through PARP-1 Hyperactivation

Rb or p53 status (6, 7, 10–12). Because NQO1 is highly expressed in many human cancers, including prostate, lung,
pancreatic, and breast cancers, β-lap has become an attractive agent for tumor-selective cancer chemotherapy.
PARP-1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme essential for repair
of DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) and an important damage
sensor, for which numerous groups are developing inhibitors
(13–15), particularly after its identification as a synthetic lethal target in BRCA1/2 breast cancers (16, 17). PARP-1 is essential for base excision repair (BER), SSB, and possibly other
DNA repair processes (18, 19). PARP-1 is activated after binding DNA strand breaks and uses NAD+ as a substrate to form
long branched polymers of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). PARP-1–
mediated poly(ADP-ribosylation) recruits various nuclear acceptor proteins, such as XRCC1, histones, and PARP-1 itself,
to assemble other repair complexes to execute DNA repair
[i.e., BER, SSB, and double-strand break (DSB) repair]. However, in response to excessive DNA damage, PARP-1 can be
hyperactivated, converting its DNA repair capacity to initiation
of programmed necrosis, due to dramatic NAD+ and ATP depletions. PARP-1 hyperactivation and programmed necrosis
have been documented in several cellular responses, including
ischemia-reperfusion, myocardial infarction, and severe ROSinduced injury (20). To date, however, the only cytotoxic agent
able to harness this cell death pathway in a tumor-selective
manner and at clinically relevant doses is β-lap (6, 21).
We previously showed that β-lap was an efficient radiosensitizer of specific cancer cells when given immediately after or during IR in vitro (22, 23). However, these studies
stalled due to a lack of knowledge about the mechanism of
action of the agent and an inability to efficaciously deliver
the drug. Based on our recent elucidation of the mechanism
of action of β-lap as a single agent (8, 9), we hypothesized
that PARP-1 hyperactivation was a key factor mediating synergy between sublethal doses of IR and β-lap. Here, we show
for the first time that PARP-1 hyperactivation is the principal
determinant governing β-lap–radiosensitizing effects in
NQO1+ human prostate cancer cells, causing early and rapid
PAR-modified PARP-1 accumulation and synergistic ATP loss
after IR + β-lap treatments. Along with dicoumarol (a specific inhibitor of NQO1), DPQ (a specific PARP-1 inhibitor)
blocked dramatic ATP depletion and apoptosis, confirming
an essential role of NQO1-dependent PARP-1 hyperactivation
in mediating synergy between these two agents. Antitumor
studies using PC-3 xenografts that have endogenously elevated NQO1 levels in athymic mice showed significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy using various combined sublethal
doses of β-lap + IR. Thus, β-lap treatment in combination
with XRT represents the first effective tumor-selective therapy
that exploits PARP-1 hyperactivation for the treatment of
cancers that have elevated NQO1 levels.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
β-Lap, synthesized by Dr. Bill Bornmann (M.D. Anderson,
Houston, TX), was dissolved in DMSO at 47 mmol/L, and
concentrations were verified by spectrophotometry. Hoechst

33258, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), staurosporine, cytochrome
c, etoposide, DPQ (3,4-dihydro-5[4-(1-piperindinyl)butoxy]-1
(2H)-isoquinoline), and dicoumarol (24) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell culture
PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells
were originally obtained from Dr. George Wilding (University
of Wisconsin-Madison). PC-3 and DU145 cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
LNCaP cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10%
FBS. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2-95% air humidified atmosphere and were free of Mycoplasma.
Western immunoblotting
Whole-cell extracts were prepared, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were developed using
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo
Scientific) and exposed using autoradiography film (Denville
Scientific, Inc.). An antihuman NQO1 antibody was kindly
provided to us by Dr. David Ross (University of Colorado
Health Science Center, Denver, CO) and used at 1:5,000 dilution overnight at 4°C. Both PAR (BD Pharmingen) and γH2AX
(Upstate) antibodies were used at 1:2,000 and 1:1,000 dilutions, respectively. β-Actin or α-tubulin levels were used as
loading controls.
Relative survival assays
Relative survival was assessed by DNA content and colony
forming assays as described (25). Briefly, for DNA content,
cells were seeded at 5 × 103 per well in 48-well plates and
allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then mock treated
or treated with various doses of β-lap (for 2 hours) in the
presence or absence of dicoumarol as indicated. Drug-free
medium was then added and cells were allowed to grow
for 5 to 7 days until control cells reached ∼100% confluence.
DNA content was then determined by Hoechst 33258 staining
and fluorescence detection using a plate reader (Perkin-Elmer;
ref. 21). Relative survival assays after combined treatment
were confirmed by colony-forming ability assays (25). Results
were reported as mean ± SE from at least three independent
experiments.
Total and oxidized glutathione assays
Disulfide and total glutathione (GSH and GSSG, respectively) levels were determined using a spectrophotometric recycling assay (26). After treatments, whole-cell homogenates
were prepared (11). Data were expressed as %GSSG/total,
normalized to protein content, following the procedure of
Lowry and colleagues (27). Data were shown as mean ± SE
of experiments performed at least three times.
Alkaline and neutral comet assays
DNA lesions, including total base damage, DSBs, and SSBs,
versus DSBs were assessed using single-cell gel electrophoretic comet assays under alkaline or neutral conditions, respectively (Trevigen). Slides were stained with SYBR Green
and visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E fluorescence

microscope. Digital photomicrographs were taken and comet
tail lengths quantified using NIH Image J software. Each data
point represented the average of 100 cells ± SE, and data
were representative of experiments performed in triplicate.

≤0.05 using two-sided Student's t test were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.1
Service Pack 4.

Results
Nucleotide analyses
Changes in intracellular NAD+ levels were measured (6) and
levels were expressed as percent treated divided by control (%
T/C) ± SE from at least three individual experiments. ATP levels were analyzed from whole-cell extracts using CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assays (Promega) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Data were graphed as mean ±
SE from at least three independent experiments in triplicate.
Apoptotic assays
Apoptosis was quantified using ApoDirect [terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)] assays from BD Pharmingen (21). Samples were
analyzed by using a FC-500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter
Electronics) and Elite acquisition software. Data were expressed as mean ± SE from three independent experiments.
Antitumor efficacy
Athymic nu/nu mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories International, Inc. All animals were housed in
a pathogen-free facility with 24-h access to food and water.
Experimental protocols were approved by the institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas
Southwestern. PC-3 cells (5 × 106) were s.c. injected into the
right thighs of athymic nude mice, and tumor volumes were
allowed to reach ∼350 mm3. Mice (five mice per group) were
then randomly grouped with no statistical differences in tumor sizes among the six groups. Mice were then mock treated or exposed to various IR doses followed immediately by
treatment with various doses (10–30 mg/kg) of β-lap-HPβCD or HPβ-CD. When used, various doses of IR were given
locally first to tumor sites with whole-body shielding. Mice
were exposed to one treatment regimen, consisting of mock
or XRT, immediately followed by HPβ-CD alone or various
β-lap-HPβ-CD doses administered via tail vein injections
for five IR + β-lap exposures. Tumor volumes were measured
by caliper (length × width × width/2) every other day. Mice
were sacrificed when tumors reached 2 cm3 or 10% total
body weight.
Statistical analyses
For relative survival, different IR + β-lap combinations
were fit with simple multitarget models in SigmaPlot for
Windows version 11.0. For synergy, a statistical definition
of synergy (28) was used and calculations were performed
by fitting experimental data with the Machado and Robinson
model using the R code (29). The equitoxic doses listed
in Table 1 were calculated using the parameters of the model
of Machado and Robinson obtained in fitting. Regression
analyses of tumor growth profiles in vivo in six tested groups
were analyzed using a mixed model approach with AR (1)
correlation structures. Log-rank tests were applied to survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier curves). In general, P values of

β-Lap induces prostate cancer cell death through
NQO1-induced ROS formation and SSBs
Our immunohistochemical analyses of human prostate tumor and associated normal tissue revealed that ∼60% of
these cancers had elevated NQO1 levels (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Using human PC-3 prostate cancer cells that express
high levels of endogenous NQO1, we showed that the cytotoxic effects of β-lap were NQO1 dependent (inhibited by dicoumarol Fig. 1A). This was confirmed in DU145 and in
NQO1-proficient (NQO1+) versus NQO1-deficient (NQO1−)
LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Importantly, only
∼120 minutes of exposure to 4 μmol/L β-lap was sufficient
to achieve maximal cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A), where significant
levels of glutathione were oxidized (note rapid and elevated
levels of %GSSG in 20–30 minutes; Fig. 1B), suggesting dramatic ROS formation. Dramatic increases in SSBs were seen
by alkaline comet assays, but DSBs, as assessed by neutral
comet assays, were not noted (Fig. 1C and D). Similar results
were found using DU145 and NQO1+ LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, NQO1− LNCaP cells were not
responsive to β-lap as described (5).
The DNA damage and repair responses of β-lap–treated
NQO1-expressing PC-3 cells were compared with their responses after IR treatment (Fig. 1E and F). Extensive DNA
lesions were noted in PC-3 cells after exposure to 4 μmol/L
β-lap, equivalent to 20 Gy by alkaline assays. However, neutral comet assays revealed DSBs after IR, but not after β-lap,
exposure (not shown). Exposure of PC-3 cells to IR (20 Gy)

resulted in DNA damage that was quickly repaired within
1 hour after treatment, whereas DNA damage created by
4 μmol/L β-lap was not repaired, but escalated over the
4-hour time period assessed, suggesting repair inhibition.
PARP-1 hyperactivation mediates β-lap–induced
programmed cell death
Exposure of PC-3 cells to lethal doses of β-lap (Fig. 2A)
caused extensive PARP-1 hyperactivation, with significant
PAR accumulation within 10 to 20 minutes that was blocked
by dicoumarol (Fig. 2B). Loss of PAR formation in β-lap–
treated PC-3 cells, which was noted from 40 to 60 minutes,
was most likely due to NAD+ substrate depletion (Fig. 2C), as
well as functional PAR glycohydrolase (30). PARP-1 hyperactivation was accompanied by dramatic NAD+ and ATP losses

as a function of (a) time (Fig. 2C), where metabolite levels
were exhausted within 120 minutes of β-lap exposure, and
(b) dose, where loss of ATP corresponded well with cytotoxicity (Fig. 2A and D). Loss of intracellular nucleotide levels
(NAD+/ATP) and lethality of β-lap–treated PC-3 cells were
blocked by dicoumarol (40 μmol/L). Dicoumarol also prevented PARP-1 hyperactivation, NAD+ and ATP losses, and
cytotoxicity in DU145 cells after β-lap exposure (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Synergy between IR and β-lap is mediated by
DNA damage, reaching a threshold for
PARP-1 hyperactivation
We previously reported that the combination of IR and βlap synergistically killed specific cancer cells (31); however,

the mechanism of synergy was not elucidated. PC-3 cells
were treated with single doses of IR (1–3 Gy) followed by
exposure to low, nontoxic doses of β-lap (1–3 μmol/L). Synergy was noted with all IR and β-lap combinations tested
(Fig. 3A), corresponding to synergistic increases of PAR
levels after combined treatments, but not after single agent
exposures. For example, dramatic PAR formation in PC-3
cells treated with 1 Gy + 3 μmol/L β-lap was noted at
60 minutes, with no apparent PAR levels in cells after each
agent alone (Fig. 3B). Similar responses were noted in
NQO1+ LNCaP and DU145 cells, but not in genetically
matched NQO1 − LNCaP cells (Supplementary Figs. S4A
and S5B, respectively). Synergy was prevented by dicoumarol in NQO1+ prostate cancer cells, corresponding to the

formation of DNA lesions (noted by alkaline comet and
γH2AX foci formation) that presumably reached threshold
levels required for PARP-1 hyperactivation (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Synergy between IR and β-lap in PC-3 cells was
accompanied by dramatic losses of ATP (Fig. 3C and D,
synergy between 2 or 3 Gy and 3 μmol/L β-lap) and
NAD+ (not shown). Importantly, synergistic losses of ATP
in PC-3 cells following 2 or 3 Gy + 3 μmol/L β-lap were
prevented by pre- and co-treating the cells with DPQ, a
specific PARP-1 inhibitor (Fig. 3C and D, respectively) that
prevented cell death induced by β-lap alone in various
endogenously overexpressing NQO1 cancer cells (6, 21).
Synergistic ATP loss was also observed in NQO1+ LNCaP
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B).

Synergy between IR and β-lap exposures
involves atypical PARP-1 cleavage and TUNEL+
programmed necrosis
Loss of survival as a result of β-lap treatment correlated
well with TUNEL+ apoptotic responses (32). The synergistic
cytotoxic responses of NQO1+ PC-3 cells after IR + β-lap
treatment were confirmed by analyzing apoptosis (Fig. 4A).
Treatment of PC-3 cells with 1 to 3 Gy, each in combination
with 2 μmol/L β-lap, resulted in significant increases in apoptotic cells within 72 hours (Fig. 4A), corresponding directly
to loss of colony forming ability (Fig. 3A). Indeed, all combination therapies of IR with β-lap (Table 1) reveal synergy at
these low doses of each agent. For example, treatment of PC3 cells with nonlethal agents (alone) in combination with IR
(i.e., 1 Gy + 1 μmol/L β-lap) was the same as treating cells
with a lethal dose of 4 μmol/L β-lap. Similar responses were
noted in NQO1+ LNCaP cells, in which synergistic levels of
apoptosis and atypical PARP-1 cleavage at 72 hours after
treatment were noted (Supplementary Fig. S6). Synergy
between IR and β-lap was prevented by DPQ (Fig. 4A) or
dicoumarol, and was not observed in NQO1− LNCaP cells.
In contrast, different low doses of IR alone (i.e., 1–3 Gy) only
led to 2 ± 2%, 5 ± 3%, and 9 ± 3% apoptosis, respectively. Sim-

ilarly, a low sublethal dose of 2 μmol/L β-lap in NQO1+ PC-3
cells resulted in minimal apoptosis (i.e., 5 ± 2%; Fig. 4A).
Cell death caused by a lethal dose of β-lap in prostate cancer cells with endogenous elevation of NQO1 involves activation of μ-calpain and atypical cleavage of PARP-1 (9), as
noted after 4 μmol/L β-lap treatment (Fig. 4B, lane 7). Similarly, exposure of PC-3 cells to IR + β-lap involved synergistic
apoptotic responses, above the additive levels with IR or βlap alone. Atypical PARP-1 cleavage (i.e., formation of an ∼60
kDa PARP-1 fragment) in combination-treated cells was noted (Fig. 4B), resulting from activation and nuclear translocation of μ-calpain (9). Similar atypical PARP-1 cleavage events
accompanied IR + β-lap synergy in NQO1+ LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Efficacy in vivo of the combination of IR and β-lap
To date, the efficacy of β-lap against human prostate cancer xenografts expressing elevated levels of endogenous
NQO1 has not been shown. Using the current clinical formulation of the drug (i.e., Arq 501) conjugated with HPβ-CD, we
showed significant efficacy of β-lap-HPβ-CD when administered at 10 or 20 mg/kg in combination with 2-Gy fractions of
IR (Fig. 5A). Mice (five per group) bearing PC-3 xenografts

with an average tumor volume of ∼350 mm3 were exposed
to five doses of IR alone, β-lap-HPβ-CD alone, or IR + β-lapHPβ-CD combinations every other day between days 1
and 9. All drug treatments were administered by i.v. injection. Treatment of mice with β-lap-HPβ-CD at 10 or
20 mg/kg exhibited neither antitumor efficacy nor morbidity
or mortality. Although mice treated with 2-Gy fractions (five

2-Gy IR with 10 or 20 mg/kg β-lap-HPβ-CD resulted in significant tumor regression beyond the additive levels with IR
or β-lap-HPβ-CD treatments alone. Ninety percent (9 of 10)
of animals exposed to IR + 10 or 20 mg/kg β-lap-HPβ-CD
were “apparently cured,” showing no further tumor growth
for up to 150 days (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, 90% PC-3-bearing mice treated with β-lap-HPβ-CD
alone (10 or 20 mg/kg) died within 40 days, similar to
control mice treated with vehicle (HPβ-CD) alone. Mice
treated with IR (2 Gy) alone showed an obvious delay in
tumor growth (Fig. 5A); however, all mice eventually died
(sacrificed when tumor volumes were >10% of their weight).
Finally, although treatment of mice with 2 Gy + 30 mg/kg
β-lap-HPβ-CD resulted in statistically equivalent tumor
growth delay and “apparent cures” (Supplementary Table S1),

we noted that the dose was close to the maximum tolerated dose of the drug (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Collectively,
we treated 15 mice (3 × 5 mice per group) with 2 Gy + 10 to
30 mg/kg β-lap-HPβ-CD, noting dramatic synergistic
responses that were statistically superior (P < 0.001) to the
2 Gy alone or β-lap-HPβ-CD alone (10–30 mg/kg) regimen
(Supplementary Table S1). Data from a representative experiment are presented in Fig. 5A.

Figure 4. Combined treatment with sublethal doses of IR and β-lap
promotes apoptosis and atypical PARP-1 cleavage. A, PC-3 cells were
exposed to the indicated treatments for 2 h, and whole-cell extracts
prepared at 72 h; apoptosis was monitored by TUNEL reactions. Columns,
mean from three independent experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, between
combined and single treatment regimens. DPQ blocked apoptosis in all
combinations (P < 0.01). B, PC-3 cells were treated as described in
A and harvested at 48 h for Western blot analyses. A lethal β-lap dose
of 4 μmol/L was used as a positive control to indicate the ∼60-kDa atypical
cleaved PARP-1. TUNEL assay data were mean ± SE from three
independent experiments.

In general, there is a great need for improved combination
therapy, where XRT is combined with tumor-selective therapies to increase antitumor efficacy, while simultaneously
decreasing normal tissue toxicity. For XRT, the intrinsic
radioresistance of many tumors poses significant clinical
obstacles, limiting efficacy (33). Since the first stereotactic
body radiotherapy (SBRT) was developed in 1991, the method has been refined to decrease high doses of IR used in
local primary or focal metastatic lesions (34, 35). Recently,

Radiosensitization through PARP-1 Hyperactivation

hypofractionated SBRT delivered by CyberKnife using three
to five fractionated high-dose XRT resulted in minimal toxicity, lowering short-term PSA and preserving normal tissue
function in men with localized prostate cancer (36, 37). However, such SBRT regimens are not suited to treat metastatic
disease, and long-lasting normal tissue toxicity is still problematic. Our data showed that XRT combined with β-lap
post-treatments selectively killed NQO1+ prostate cancer
cells, offering a strategy to use lower efficacious doses of IR
for targeted therapy while simultaneously eliminating prostate cancer micrometastases. This therapy should be applicable to all cancers that have elevated levels of NQO1.
β-Lap is the only agent that selectively kills tumor cells by
PARP-1–mediated, μ-calpain–directed programmed necrosis
at clinically relevant doses. Detailed knowledge of its mechanism of action can be exploited for improving XRT of tumors
with elevated NQO1 levels. The tumor-selective nature of the
therapy, for those individuals with elevated NQO1 levels,
should allow reduced IR exposures while achieving improved
antitumor efficacy and simultaneously avoiding normal tissue
complications. Importantly, resistance to β-lap–induced,
NQO1-directed antitumor cytotoxicity has not been noted
to date (10, 12), most likely due to the diverse downstream
effects of this drug in NQO1-containing cells, including dramatic alterations in nucleotide metabolism (i.e., NAD+/ATP
losses), DNA damage, and loss of Ca2+ homeostasis.
DNA damage response pathways have become new and effective targets to potentiate XRT. Considerable interest has
been focused on targeting PARP-1 to eliminate DNA repair
and enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to other DNAdamaging agents, including chemotherapeutic agents and
IR (38–40). None of these approaches currently exploit
PARP-1 hyperactivation, which requires a “threshold” of
DNA lesions to activate a suicide pathway. Our data suggest
that massive levels of ROS formed by β-lap lead to persistent
base lesions that are ultimately converted to SSBs by BER,
which, in turn, hyperactivate PARP-1. Due to dramatic NAD+/
ATP losses, other repair processes that depend on energy are
blocked, preventing repair of lethal DSBs created by IR. The
delayed increase in γH2AX formation after PAR formation
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) is consistent with PARP-1 break
protection, followed by SSBs and eventually DSB formation
detected by ATM, resulting in γH2AX foci formation.
Current phase I/II clinical trials of β-lap (i.e., Arq 501) were
limited by high doses of HPβ-CD vehicle that caused hemolytic anemia, limiting efficacy. We show that nontoxic doses
of β-lap-HPβ-CD can be delivered in combination with XRT
for efficacious antitumor therapy of prostate cancers expressing endogenously elevated NQO1 levels. The efficacy of combination therapy was much greater than that of single
regimens alone (Table 1). Synergy between IR and β-lap
in vitro was determined using several applied models (28,
29, 41, 42), but the Machado model gave the most consistent
results. Overall, the ability of β-lap to sensitize IR-exposed
NQO1+ tumor cells relates to the higher DNA lesions created
by the drug/radiation combination that meets a threshold
level required for PARP-1 hyperactivation and synergistic cell
death, consistent with prior findings (31).

Here, we show that lethal doses of β-lap alone or sublethal doses of IR + β-lap kill NQO1+ prostate cancer tumor
cells as a result of extensive ROS formation, massive DNA
damage, PARP-1 hyperactivation, and dramatic energy depletion (Figs. 1 and 2). Energy depletion, in turn, dramatically inhibits DNA repair. PAR formation was detected after
combined IR + β-lap treatments, but not after single sublethal exposures of IR or β-lap alone in NQO1+ LNCaP cells.
LNCaP NQO1− cells were not responsive (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Downstream, dramatic metabolic changes culminated in catastrophic Ca2+ homeostasis. Atypical PARP-1
cleavage was noted after combination therapy, but not after
sublethal IR or β-lap single treatment alone, in NQO1+ human prostate cancer cells (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S6B),
consistent with μ-calpain–mediated TUNEL+ programmed
cell death responses after lethal doses of β-lap (6, 9). Because β-lap alone or XRT + β-lap combination therapy kills
cells independent of cell cycle or p53 status, it represents a
controllable synergistic therapy for slow-growing NQO1+
prostate cancer, as well as for non–small cell lung, pancreatic, and breast cancers, whose elevated NQO1 levels are
more frequent and even greater than those of enzyme activities in associated normal tissue. Importantly, we show
for the first time that XRT + β-lap-HPβ-CD caused significant long-term tumor regression with no tumor recurrence.
The use of β-lap to synergize with IR (XRT) offers selectivity that can be rapidly individualized, such as for those
prostate cancer patients whose NQO1 levels are elevated.
Patients with easily detectable polymorphisms in NQO1
can be screened using blood-derived SNP analyses and
excluded from treatment (21). Although efficacious, we theorize that improved drug delivery using millirods for brachytherapy (43) or nanoparticle micelles (44) with XRT
will further augment antitumor efficacy for the treatment
of cancers with elevated NQO1 levels, such as for prostate
cancer.
