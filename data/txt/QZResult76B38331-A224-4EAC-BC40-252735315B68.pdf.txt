ABSTRACT
To assess the therapeutic outcome of selective block of VEGFR1, we have
evaluated the activity of a new specific antagonist of VEGFR1, named iVR1 (inhibitor
of VEGFR1), in syngenic and xenograft colorectal cancer models, in an artificial model
of metastatization, and in laser-induced choroid neovascularization. iVR1 inhibited
tumor growth and neoangiogenesis in both models of colorectal cancer, with an
extent similar to that of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody anti-VEGF-A. It potently
inhibited VEGFR1 phosphorylation in vivo, determining a strong inhibition of the
recruitment of monocyte-macrophages and of mural cells as confirmed, in vitro, by the
ability to inhibit macrophages migration. iVR1 was able to synergize with irinotecan
determining a shrinkage of tumors that became undetectable after three weeks of
combined treatment. Such treatment induced a significant prolongation of survival
similar to that observed with bevacizumab and irinotecan combination. iVR1 also
fully prevented lung invasion by HCT-116 cells injected in mouse tail vein. Also, iVR1
impressively inhibited choroid neovascularization after a single intravitreal injection.
Collectively, data showed the strong potential of iVR1 peptide as a new anti-tumor
and anti-metastatic agent and demonstrate the high flexibility of VEGFR1 antagonists
as therapeutic anti-angiogenic agents in different pathological contexts.

growth factors (VEGF) and related receptors play a central
role in promoting vessel formation and maturation. Indeed,
since a decade they are the only validated targets for the
anti-angiogenesis therapy in cancer and ocular neovascular
diseases [3, 4]. After the approval by FDA of bevacizumab
(Avastin), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb)
against VEGF-A for the treatment of metastatic colorectal
carcinoma (mCRC) in combination with chemotherapy

INTRODUCTION
The development and maintenance of functional
vessels through angiogenesis and arteriogenesis processes
in pathological conditions require the cooperation of
several growth factor families, of multiple cell types and
the presence of certain conditions such as hypoxia and
inflammation [1, 2]. The family of vascular endothelial

[5], other anti-angiogenic drugs targeting members of
VEGF family have been developed such as aflibercept, a
recombinant fusion protein consisting of VEGF-binding
extracellular domains of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 fused to
the Fc portion of human IgG1, and several multitargets
tyrosine kinase inhibitors which inhibit also VEGF
receptors [4].
Anti-angiogenic drugs have been approved to
treat different types of cancer, such as mCRC, non-small
cell lung carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
gastrointestinal stromal tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma,
and others. However, despite the significant clinical
success of anti-angiogenic therapies, alternative strategies
are desirable to improve their therapeutic efficacy and to
overcome inherent/acquired resistance and the relevant
side effects [6, 7].
VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1, also known as Flt1) is the common receptor for the three pro-angiogenic
family members VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth
factor (PlGF). It is the unique receptor for VEGF-B and
PlGF, and shows higher affinity for VEGF-A compared
to VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or Flk-1), which is
exclusively recognized by VEGF-A. VEGFR1 expression
is upregulated by hypoxia and is also expressed as
soluble form generated by an alternative splicing (termed
sVEGFR1), which is one of the most potent physiological
inhibitor of angiogenesis [8].
Differently from VEGFR2 found almost exclusively
in endothelial cells, VEGFR1 is expressed in several types
of cells, many of which play a fundamental role during the
angiogenesis and arteriogenesis process. Endothelial cells,
bone marrow stem/precursor cells, circulating endothelial
cells, stromal cells, perycites and smooth muscle cells,
monocyte-macrophages, dendritic cells, all express
functional VEGFR1 that once activated induces mainly
survival, proliferation and migration pathways [9]. In
addition, several human cancer cells express VEGFR1 [10].
VEGFR1 was initially classified as decoy receptor
for VEGF-A because of its low tyrosine kinase activity,
compared to VEGFR2 [11], and the viability of mice in
which VEGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain was ablated
(Flt1tk−/−) [12]. However several other reports re-evaluated
it as a functional receptor, thereby as possible therapeutic
target. Flt1tk−/− mice showed impaired angiogenesis
and reduced inflammation under several disease
conditions, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, choroidal
neovascularization and cancer growth [13–15]. The
activation of VEGFR1 promotes tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis through diverse mechanisms [16]. It stimulates
angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial and monocyte
progenitor cells from bone marrow into tumor vasculature
[17, 18] as well as smooth muscle cells to cover and
stabilize neovessels [19]. VEGFR1 also plays a central role
in the modulation of inflammatory component of tumors,
driving the recruitment and activity of macrophages and
dendritic cells and contributing to tumor-cell survival
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

during the epithelial–mesenchymal transition [20].
Furthermore, VEGFR1 activation markedly promotes
pulmonary metastases through induction of matrix
metalloproteinase-9 secretion [21] and plays a crucial role
in the establishment of pre-metastatic niches [22].
The functional role of VEGFR1 in tumor and
metastasis contexts was confirmed using inhibitors from
different sources. Ribozyme [23], mAb [24], peptides [25,
26], or DNAzyme [27] specifically targeting VEGFR1, all
inhibit tumor growth and metastasis formation.
Here, we describe the potent anti-angiogenic,
anti-tumor, and anti-metastatic activity of a tetrameric
tripeptide named iVR1 (inhibitor of VEGFR1), which
is able to specifically bind mouse and human VEGFR1
blocking receptor activation by preventing the interaction
of the natural ligands VEGF-A, VEGF-B, PlGF and
VEGF-A/PlGF heterodimer (IC50 6–10 μM) [28].
The anti-angiogenic activity of iVR1 has been first
assessed in the choroid neovascularization (CNV) model.
Then, iVR1 activity has been assayed in syngenic and
xenograft models of colorectal cancer and compared to
that of mAbs inhibiting the two main ligands of VEGFR1,
VEGF-A and PlGF. The ability of iVR1 to synergize
with chemotherapy, as well as the anti-metastatic
properties, evaluating lung invasion by colorectal cancer
cells injected in the blood circulation, have been also
investigated.

RESULTS
Anti-angiogenic in vivo activity of iVR1
iVR1, previously referred as 4.23.5, has a mole­
cular mass of 2362.02 g/mol and is composed by the
tripeptide H2N-D-Glu–L-Cys(Bzl)–L-Cha, where D-Glu
is D-glutammic acid, L-Cys(Bzl) is L-cysteine-S-benzyl
and L-Cha is L-cyclohexylalanine, engrafted on a trilysine core (Figure 1A, 1B). The in vitro activity of iVR1
has been yet fully characterized. The presence of unnatural
amino acids and the multimeric structure confer high
resistance to degradation in biological fluids. It specifically
binds VEGFR1 and does not interfere with VEGFR2
activity. It prevents both the VEGFR1 phosphorylation
and the capillary-like tube formation of human primary
endothelial cells, as well as neovascularization of chicken
embryo chorioallantoic membrane induced by PlGF or
VEGF-A [28].
In order to assess the iVR1 anti-angiogenic acti­
vity in vivo, we used the laser-induced CNV model.
Immediately after the induction of laser damage, single
intravitreal injections of iVR1, of the control peptide
(CP)  and of anti-mouse VEGF-A polyclonal antibody,
were performed. After seven days, CNV volume was
evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis of retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) choroid flat mounts. CP
(50 μg, 21 nmol) was unable to inhibit CNV whereas,

(−52.5% in average). iVR1 was able to induce a dosedependent inhibition with an impressive reduction of CNV

inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis, as assessed by vessel
density measurement of tumors explanted 16 days after

significant and similar inhibition of blood vessel density
compared to vehicle and CP (−59.8% and −55.3% in
average, respectively) (Figure 2B).
To generate tumor xenografts, we injected the
HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells in athymic nude mice
and, after seven days, treatments with bevacizumab, antihuman PlGF mAb 16D3, iVR1 and CP peptides started
(Figure 2C). Surprisingly, tumor growth curves in iVR1
and bevacizumab treated mice were fully superimposable,
resulting in a significant tumor growth delay starting from
four days of treatment, compared to vehicle and CP. The
mAb 16D3, able to block only PlGF produced by human
cells, also determined a significant inhibition compared
to vehicle and CP. Bevacizumab and iVR1 tumor growth

iVR1 is a potent inhibitor of monocytemacrophages and mural cells recruitment

and ex vivo isolated peritoneal macrophages. Growth
factors stimulated to similar extents cell migration, which
was inhibited by iVR1 in a dose-dependent manner
already at 10 μg/ml (Figure 5A, 5B).
In the attempt to optimize the dosage of iVR1, we
treated mice bearing xenograft tumors with decreasing
doses of compound (25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg), while
control mice were treated with vehicle and CP or
bevacizumab at the dosages previously used (Figure 5C).
iVR1 at 25 mg/kg still inhibited tumor growth as much as
bevacizumab, while at 10 mg/kg no significant inhibition
was observed. In subsequent experiments iVR1 thereby
was delivered at 25 mg/kg.

Monocytes-macrophages play a well-established
role in tumor angiogenesis [30, 31], and VEGFR1 has an
active role for their recruitment at neo-angiogenic sites. We
thereby determined the extent of monocytes-macrophages
infiltration in tumors by F4/80 immunohistochemical
analysis. In syngenic tumors, mAb 5D11D4 determined
a significant reduction of F4/80 positive area compared
to vehicle and CP (−52.7% on average), as expected by
blocking one of theVEGFR1 specific ligands. The block
of all the VEGFR1 ligands by iVR1 determined a greater
reduction of F4/80 positive area compared to vehicle
and CP (−78.0% on average). Such reduction was also
significantly higher compared to 5D11D4 (−53.6%)
(Figure 3A). In tumor xenografts, iVR1 treatment induced
an impressive suppression of monocyte-macrophages
recruitment compared to vehicle and CP (−81.3% on
average). The inhibition resulted considerably higher
compared to that produced by bevacizumab or 16D3
treatments, which, however, also induced a substantial
inhibition with respect to vehicle and CP (−67.6% and
−49.4%, on average) (Figure 3B, 3C).
VEGFR1 has also a functional role in the
recruitment of mural cells, a step required for maturation
and stabilization of neovessels [19]. The extent of vessel
coverage by smooth muscle cells in tumor xenografts
was estimated by immunostaining with anti-smooth
muscle α-actin (SMA). All the treatments determined
significant and extensive reduction of vessel coverage,
similar for 16D3 and iVR1 (−59.3% and −58.0%
on average, respectively) and slightly lower for
bevacizumab (−51% on average) compared to vehicle
and CP (Figure 4A, 4B).
VEGFR1 phosphorylation status was evaluated in
tumor xenograft protein extracts. Matching amounts of
protein extracts from tumors belonging to the same group
were mixed and analyzed by western blot. The block
of single ligands, achieved with bevacizumab or 16D3,
determined a partial decrease of VEGFR1 phosphorylation
(−35.2% and −22.6% on average, respectively) compared
to vehicle and CP, which were both ineffective. iVR1
induced a powerful lessening of VEGFR1 phosphorylation
(−78.2% on average, versus vehicle and CP)(Figure 4C).
Collectively, these data demonstrated that iVR1 is
a potent inhibitor of VEGFR1 activation in vivo and of
VEGFR1-mediated recruitment of non-endothelial cells
involved in tumor angiogenesis.

iVR1 and irinotecan synergistically inhibited
CRC in vivo growth
Among systemic treatments clinically approved
for mCRC patients, irinotecan and bevacizumab
containing regimens are largely used for their efficacy.
Therefore, we evaluated if iVR1 activity might synergize
with irinotecan, a camptotecin-based inhibitor of
topoisomerase I [32]. Drugs were delivered starting
at day 5 from cells inoculation and the combination
treatment was compared to single treatments or vehicle
(Figure 6A). At day 21 from cell inoculation, tumor
growth inhibition induced by iVR1 was similar to that
induced by irinotecan and both were significantly greater
compared to vehicle (−58.3%, p < 0.005). Strikingly, the
iVR1-irinotecan combination induced a very powerful
inhibition of tumor growth already at day 21 (−82.1%,
p < 0.0001 versus vehicle and −58.2%, p < 0.005,
versus iVR1 and irinotecan alone), causing a progressive
reduction of the tumors volume starting at day 16. Since
we observed an almost total regression of tumors in the
combination group, treatments were stopped seven days
later. Indeed, at day 28, only two out of seven tumors
were still detectable and for the next 20 days tumors were
not measurable, with a delay in tumor relapse of about 50
days compared to vehicle-treated tumors. iVR1-treated
tumors relapsed more rapidly than the irinotecan-treated
ones, both reaching 1500 – 1600 mm3 average volume
20 and 30 days later, respectively, than vehicle-treated
tumors (Figure 6A).
Therefore, we evaluated the inhibition of VEGFR1
phosphorylation after delivery of iVR1 at 25 mg/kg.
While irinotecan, as expected, did not affect VEGFR1
phosphorylation, in iVR1 and iVR1 plus irinotecantreated tumors, a potent inhibition of VEGFR1 was
observed. Inhibition was equivalent to that achieved
delivering iVR1 at 50 mg/kg, thus indicating that even at
25 mg/kg iVR1 affords a powerful anti-VEGFR1 activity
in vivo (Figure 6B).
In order to evaluate the impact of treatments on
the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice, and to compare
the effect of iVR1-irinotecan combination with that

area of monocyte-macrophage infiltrate in syngenic (A) and xenograft (B) tumors was determined by immunostaining with anti-F4/80
antibody and calculated on five optical fields for each tumor. Data are represented as the mean ± SEM (N = 7). A, *p < 0.0005 and

of bevacizumab-irinotecan, we performed a further
experiment in which animals were treated with vehicle,
irinotecan, iVR1, bevacizumab, iVR1-irinotecan and
bevacizumab-irinotecan. Drugs were delivered, as for
previous experiment, for 24 days starting from day 5 from
cell inoculation and animals were sacrificed when tumors
reached a volume close to 2000 mm3. Kaplan-Meier
distribution is reported in Figure 6C. Treatments with
bevacizumab, irinotecan or iVR1 likewise determined
a median increase of survival comprised between 20
and 28 days, compared to vehicle-treated mice. Again,
the combination iVR1-irinotecan confirmed its synergic
effect showing an activity fully comparable to that of
the bevacizumab-irinotecan combination with a survival
median increase of more than 40 days, compared to
vehicle-treated mice.
Remarkably, no apparent signs of toxicity were
observable after delivering iVR1 at 50 mg/kg for 14 days
and at 25 mg/kg for 80 days, administered each other day.
Also, body weight was recorded and no differences were
observable in iVR1 treated mice as compared to vehicle or
other controls (data not shown).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Collectively, these data confirmed the powerful
therapeutic potential of iVR1 alone and in combination
with irinotecan, which resulted comparable to that of
bevacizumab alone or in combination regimen.

iVR1 prevented the development of CRC lung
metastases in mice
VEGFR1 positive hematopoietic progenitors have
been involved in metastatization process [22]. We thus
investigated the effect of iVR1 in an artificial model of
metastatization. HCT-116 cells were injected in the tail
vein of nude mice and treatments with bevacizumab,
iVR1, CP or vehicle (N = 5 per group) started immediately
after cell injection, following the same schedule adopted
for the combination and survival experiments. DNA
was extracted from mice lungs to quantify human Alu
sequences by qRT-PCR (Table 1 and Supplementary
Figure 1). Alu sequences were well detectable at similar
levels in the lungs of vehicle and CP treated mice.
Bevacizumab induced a strong reduction compared to
vehicle and CP whereas in iVR1-treated mice the quantity

iVR1 was also active in preventing the transmigration of
colorectal cancer cells from blood circulation to lung.

vessel stabilization, suggests the following considerations.
The partial inhibition of VEGFR1 activation observed with
mAbs anti-PlGF had the lowest effect on tumor growth and
neoangiogenesis inhibition, as expected by the selective
blockade of the PlGF/VEGFR1 axis. A similar reduction
of VEGFR1 phosphorylation induced by bevacizumab,
but associated with the inhibition of VEGFR2 activation
through the blockade of VEGF-A, determined a much
stronger decrease of tumor growth, neovascularization,
and monocyte macrophage recruitment. Interestingly, the
nearly fully block of VEGFR1 activation promoted by
iVR1 translated into effects similar to those produced by
bevacizumab, at least in terms of tumor growth and mural
cells recruitment. Of note, while bevacizumab caused the
highest reduction of neovessel formation, iVR1 determined
the highest reduction of monocyte-macrophages infiltration.
We hypothesize that the strong inhibition of monocytemacrophage recruitment at neo-angiogenic site, where they
sustain and fuel pathological angiogenesis [30, 31], together
with the potential inhibiting effects on the recruitment of
others VEGFR1-positive bone marrow derived precursors,
seemingly compensate for the lower effect on neovessel
formation, as compared to bevacizumab activity.
Another potent VEGFR1 inhibitor is the mAb
IMC-18F1 (icrucumab, Eli Lilly and Company), which in
preclinical models of breast cancer inhibits tumor xenograft

DISCUSSION
The role of VEGFR1 in pathological angiogenesis
and its participation to the angiogenic switch and
metastatic process are still under debate [3, 21, 22, 33].
We report a potent anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic and antimetastatic activity of the antagonist iVR1, which supports
the important role played by VEGFR1 in tumor and, more
in general, in pathological angiogenesis.
Among the several non-protein VEGFR1 antagonists
so far described [23, 25–27, 34, 35] those with proven
in vivo tumor inhibition activity are a ribozyme, the
DNAzyme DT-18, the hexapeptide GNQWFI and the
20-aminoacid peptide named BP-1 [23, 25–27]. None of
these molecules have been so far tested in combination
with chemotherapeutics nor assessment of survival rate has
been reported. Therefore, iVR1 is the first VEGFR1 nonprotein antagonist for which extensive characterization as
anti-tumor agent is reported and is also the first showing
potent inhibition of VEGFR1 phosphorylation in vivo.
This property, together with the effects observed on tumor
vascularization, on inflammatory cells infiltration and on

Standard concentrations of human genomic DNA were used as template for qRT-PCR to amplify Alu sequences. For each
concentration analyzed, the average values of cycle threshold (CTm) ± SD are reported (each point in triplicate) and a standard
curve was constructed. Genomic DNA extracted from lungs of mice treated with vehicle, iVR1, CP and bevacizumab (bevaciz)
(N = 5 per group) were amplified (see Supplementary Figure 1). Based on the average value of cycle threshold (CTm) obtained,
the quantity of human Alu sequences were extrapolated by comparison with the standard curve, using exponential regression.

tumor efficacy [24]. These findings clearly indicated the
relevance of blocking either human VEGFR1, expressed by
tumor cells, and mouse VEGFR1, expressed on endogenous
cells, which both contribute to tumor formation. In this
regard, a major feature of iVR1 accounting for the potent
activity showed in xenograft models is the ability to inhibit
both human and mouse VEGFR1.
Differently from the current anti-angiogenic drugs
(bevacizumab, aflibercept and TK inhibitors) used to
treat cancer patients, iVR1 does not interfere with the
VEGFA/VEGFR2 pathway. Although it is widely accepted
that the blockade of VEGFA/VEGFR2 is crucial for
inhibiting neovessel formation, mainly for the direct
effects on endothelial cells, the impressive anti-tumor
activity achieved with the irinotecan-iVR1 combination in
CRC models, and the resulting outstanding survival rate
comparable to that of irinotecan-bevacizumab combination,
strengthen the concept that a potent and selective VEGFR1
inhibition produces therapeutic effects comparable to
those caused by the blockade of VEGF-A. This is probably
mainly due to the potent inhibition of the recruitment of
non-endothelial VEGFR1 positive cells involved in neovessels formation. Moreover, VEGFR1 blockade may be
advantageous in terms of toxicity. As indeed previously
reported, blocking VEGFR1 or its specific ligand PlGF
is less detrimental compared to VEGF-A blockade [36,
37], which, given the vital role of VEGF-A/VEGFR2
pathway in the physiological homeostasis of vessels [38],
is responsible of the several side effects observed not only
in cancer, but also in ocular neovascular diseases [6, 7].
Concerning the anti-metastatic activity of iVR1, this
is in line with that exerted by the other VEGFR1 inhibitors
previously mentioned, the ribozyme, the hexapeptide
GNQWFI [23, 25], and the peptide BP-1 [26]. Based
on our data, we hypothesize that the ability to prevent
the activation and migration of VEGFR1 positive bone
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

marrow precursors necessary for pre-metastatic niche
formation [22], might represent one of the mechanisms by
which iVR1 is able to fully prevent the transmigration of
cancer cell from blood circulation to the lungs.
iVR1 is also able to potently reduce laser-induced
CNV, the pre-clinical model for the age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) condition. AMD is a VEGF-A-driven
disease and currently patients are treated with ranibizumab
or aflibercept, approved by FDA, or with bevacizumab off
label [39]. Therefore, the anti-angiogenic activity of iVR1
may be also explored in different pathological contexts
where angiogenesis is involved.
Altogether, our results strongly support the concept
that targeting VEGFR1 with selective inhibitors has a
huge therapeutic potential in cancer, and more in general,
in angiogenesis-driven diseases. Despite the micromolar
affinity for VEGFR1, the outstanding anti-angiogenic
properties, the anti-tumor features similar to those of
bevacizumab, especially when it is used in combination
with chemotherapeutics, and the preliminary observations
supportive of a seemingly very low toxicity, makes
iVR1 a very good candidate for further development.
Further assessment of toxicity, drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetics will be undertaken together with
chemical modifications to improve potency, solubility and
eventually absorption and distribution, to further improve
the therapeutic index of this very promising compound.

MATERIALs AND METHODS
iVR1 peptide preparation
iVR1 and control peptides were synthesized as
previously described [28]. For the in vivo delivery, we
used as vehicle 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, 50%
sterile water. Two hours before injection, peptides were

106 CT26 or 4 x 106 HCT-116 cells into the right flank,
respectively. Tumor volume (mm3) was quantified three
times a week by measuring tumor shortest (d) and longest
(D) diameters with an electronic caliper, using the formula
D x d2/2. For all experiments, when tumors became
measurable (by day 6 or 7 from cells injection, 50–100
mm3) mice were randomly divided (n = 7). Treatments
were performed by intraperitoneal injections (max volume
100 μl) with the following schedules: vehicle PEG400/
H2O 1:1, iVR1, 10 to 50 mg/kg and control peptide
(CP), 50 mg/kg, each other day; monoclonal antibodies
anti-PlGF 5D11D4 and 16D3 (Thrombogenics), 25 mg/
kg, or bevacizumab (Genentech), 5 mg/kg, twice a week;
irinotecan 50 mg/kg once a week. Mice weight was
recorded at each tumor measurement. For ethical reasons,
mice were sacrificed when tumor reached a volume
between 1500 and 2000 mm3. The highest dose of iVR1
at 50 mg/kg was chosen on the basis of the estimated IC50
of 6–10 μM [28].

suspended in PEG400/water by magnetic stirring at 50°C
in sterilized glass vials. We obtained a stable and high
homogeneous suspension containing up to 20 mg/ml of
peptides.

Cell culture
CT26 (murine colon carcinoma), RAW 246.7
(murine macrophage) and HCT-116 (human colorectal
carcinoma) cell lines, all from American Type Culture
Collection, were grown in RPMI 1640, DMEM and
McCoy’s medium (Euroclone) respectively, supplemented
with 10% inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM
glutamine and standard concentration of antibiotics.
Mouse macrophages were isolated from peritoneum of
C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injection of 1 mL of 3%
Brewer thioglycollate Medium (Sigma). After 4 days mice
were sacrificed and peritoneal lavage with cold-ice D-PBS
20% FBS were performed to recover macrophages, which
were stained with biotinylated rat anti mouse F4/80 (1:50;
Serotec) and isolated using anti-biotin MicroBeads and
MS Separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec).

Artificial metastasis assay and quantification of
human Alu sequences

Cell migration

7- to 8-week-old male CD1 nude athymic mice were
anesthetized and injected with 3 x 105 HCT-116 cells via
tail vein. Treatments by day zero and for 24 days, were
performed with vehicle, CP and iVR1 (50 mg/kg), or
bevacizumab, following the schedule reported before.
Mice were sacrificed on day 25 and genomic DNA was
extracted from all the lobes of mice lungs using QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The concentration of doublestranded DNA was determined using BIORAD Experion
and 1K Experion DNA Kit (Biorad). To quantify human
Alu sequences in DNA extracted from mice lungs, specific
primers reported by Schneider et al. [40] were used to
perform qRT-PCR as previously described [41].

Ex vivo isolated macrophages or starved RAW246.7
cells (40000 cells/well) were placed into the upper
chamber of a 24-multiwell insert system with 5-μm pore
size polycarbonate filter (Corning). Cell migration was
stimulated with VEGF-A or PLGF-1 (100 ng/mL) added to
the starvation medium into the lower chamber, in presence
of iVR1 (2 μM, 10 μM or 50 μM) or CP (50 μM). After
24 h for RAW246.7, or 6 h for peritoneal macrophage,
cells on the top of the filter were removed and those on
the bottom side were stained with DAPI. Images were
recorded on Leica DMI 6000 microscope equipped with
Hamamatsu Orca R2 camera. Single cells were counted
using Tile Scan Macro of LAS AF Software (Leica).

Tumor protein extracts and western blot analysis

Animals

Frozen tumor samples were disrupted with a TissueLyser (Qiagen), 100 mg in 300 μL of lysis buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1%
SDS, 0.5% Na-Deossycolate, 0.2% NaN3) supplemented
with protease inhibitors (Roche), for 5 minutes at 3000
rpm. The supernatants were recovered and stored at
−80°C. Western blot analyses on mixed matching amounts
of extracts belonging to the same experimental tumor
group were performed as previously described [42].

Balb/c mice or CD1 nude athymic mice, were
purchased from Charles River. C57Bl/6J mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Animal
experiments were in accordance with European directives
no. 2010/63/UE and with Italian directives D.L. 26/2014,
and with the guidelines of the University of Kentucky
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For all
procedures, anesthesia was performed by intraperitoneal
injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 10
mg/kg xylazine.

Immunohistochemical analyses
10 μm-thick cryiopreserved tumors sections were
fixed with PFA 4% and incubated overnight at 4°C
with the following primary antibodies: rat anti-mouse
PECAM-1 (anti-CD31; 1:1000; BD Pharmingen), rat
anti-mouse F4/80 (1:50; Serotec) and anti-mouse smooth
muscle α-actin (1:1000; DAKO). The staining procedure

Syngeneic and xenograft tumor models
7- to 8-week-old male Balb/c mice for syngeneic
tumors model, or CD1 nude athymic mice for xenografts
tumor model, were injected subcutaneously with 1 x

antibody (all from DAKO). Slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin. Images were recorded with a digital
camera Leica. Densitometric analyses were performed
with QwinPro software (Leica). Quantifications were
performed on five optical fields for each tumor.
