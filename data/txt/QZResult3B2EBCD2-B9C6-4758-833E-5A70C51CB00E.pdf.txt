Abstract

Author Manuscript

We have previously reported the development of small molecule phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5trisphosphate (PIP3) antagonists (PITs) that block pleckstrin homology (PH) domain interaction,
including activation of Akt, and show anti-tumor potential. Here we show that the same molecules
inhibit growth factor-induced actin remodeling, lamellipodia formation and, ultimately, cell
migration and invasion, consistent with an important role of PIP3 in these processes. In vivo, a
PIT-1 analog displays significant inhibition on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. ADP
ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) was recently identified as an important mediator of cytoskeleton and
cell motility, which is regulated by PIP3-dependent membrane translocation of the guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide binding-site
opener (ARNO) and general receptor for 3-phosphoinositides (GRP1). We demonstrate that PITs
inhibit PIP3/ARNO or GRP1 PH domain binding and membrane localization, resulting in the
inhibition of ARF6 activation. Importantly, we show that expression of the constitutively active
mutant of Arf6 attenuates inhibition of lamellipodia formation and cell migration by PITs,
confirming that inhibition of Arf6 contributes to inhibition of these processes by PITs. Overall,
our studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing specific small molecule targeting PIP3
binding by PH domains as potential anti-cancer agents that can simultaneously interfere with
cancer development at multiple points.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) , a lipid product of Phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K), controls a complex cellular signaling network regulating cell survival and
motility (Park et al., 2008). This makes PIP3 one of the most important second messengers
downstream from growth factor and oncogene signals. PIP3 exerts its effect through binding
to the plekstrin homology (PH) domains of multiple downstream effector proteins (Park et
al., 2008). Dysregulation of PI3K signaling, which is very frequently observed in human
tumors (Cantley, 2002; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002), has made this pathway a very
important target for drug discovery. In many cases, regulation of PIP3 targets, such as PDK1
and Akt, and their dowstream signaling pathway has been a primary focus in drug discovery,
because of the role of these pathways in the regulation of cancer cell survival and
metabolism. Regulation of cell motility is another very important function of PIP3. This
effect is exerted through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of Akt and PDK1, as
well as a large number of PH domain-containing proteins, such as ADP-ribosylation factor
nucleotide binding-site opener (ARNO) and general receptor for 3-phosphoinositides
(GRP1), controlling activation of Rho and ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) families of
GTPases. Thus, dysregulation of PI3K signaling plays a profound, yet complex, role in the
control of the cancer cell invasiveness (Cantley, 2002; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). We
have recently described two new classes of antagonists of PIP3/PH domain binding, termed
PITENINs (PITs) (Miao et al., 2010). In the present work, we have investigated the effects
of these molecules on the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility.

In particular, our initial results suggested that PITs target PH domains of GRP1 and ARNO,
in addition to those of Akt and PDK1. GRP1 and ARNO are Guanine Exchange Factors
(GEFs) of ARF GTPases (Caumont et al., 2000; Frank et al., 1998a; Frank et al., 1998b;
Langille et al., 1999; Santy and Casanova, 2001). Therefore, we have explored the
regulation of this family by PITs. ARF is a member of the Ras superfamily of small
GTPases. Among the six known ARF isoforms, ARF6 has received significant attention
because of its unique role in the regulation of actin remodeling at the plasma membrane,
formation of membrane ruffles, and ultimately, its contribution to the regulation of cell
motility and endosome recycling (Balana et al., 2005; Donaldson, 2003). ARF6 has also
been shown to play important roles in tumor cell invasion in vitro and tumor metastasis in
vivo (Balana et al., 2005; Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009; Tague et al., 2004). Screening of
various breast tumor cell lines has revealed a direct correlation between ARF6 protein
expression and tumor invasiveness (Hashimoto et al., 2004). In contrast, downregulation of
ARF6 by siRNA or expression of dominant-negative ARF6 mutants blocks tumor cell
migration and invasion, resulting in reduced metastasis in vivo (Hashimoto et al., 2004;
Tague et al., 2004).
ARF6 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound form localizing to the cytosol, and an active
GTP-bound form, translocating to the plasma membrane. Activation of ARF6 is stimulated
by GEFs, which promote release of GDP and binding of GTP, whereas inactivation is
stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (Gillingham and Munro, 2007; Nie et al.,
2003). Cytohesin family proteins ARNO and GRP1 are known phosphoinositide-dependent
GEFs with preference for ARF6 in cells and in vivo (Caumont et al., 2000; Frank et al.,
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 March 27.

1998a; Frank et al., 1998b; Langille et al., 1999; Santy and Casanova, 2001). ARNO and
GRP1 possess similar domain architecture, consisting of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a
catalytic Sec7 domain (ARF-GEF activity), a phosphoinositide-binding PH domain, and a
short C-terminal basic amino acid region (Chardin et al., 1996; Jackson and Casanova,
2000).

Author Manuscript

ARF6 translocates to plasma membrane in response to growth factor stimulation, where it is
activated by GEFs and modulates actin remodeling and lamellipodia formation. Membrane
translocation of both ARF6 and its GEFs is necessary for their efficient interaction and
ARF6 activation (Cavenagh et al., 1996; Macia et al., 2004; Santy and Casanova, 2001;
Yang et al., 1998). The recruitment of ARNO and GRP1 to plasma membrane has been
shown to be mediated by the binding of their PH domains to phosphoinositides (Chardin et
al., 1996; Jackson and Casanova, 2000). Overexpression of ARNO causes cells to develop
broad lamellipodia, separate from neighboring cells, and exhibit a dramatic increase in a
migratory behavior. In contrast, an ARNO mutant lacking the PH domain was found to no
longer undergo translocation to the plasma membrane and was unable to mediate actin
reorganization (Frank et al., 1998b). The PH domains of ARNO and GRP1 exhibit a 50- to
100-fold higher affinity for PI(3,4,5)P3 than either PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4)P2 (Kavran et al.,
1998; Klarlund et al., 1997; Klarlund et al., 1998; Venkateswarlu et al., 1998). There is also
report that ARNO binds to PIP2 with an affinity comparable to that for PIP3.

Author Manuscript

In the current work, we report that PITs inhibit cancer cell migration, invasion and
angiogenesis in vitro and cancer angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo. We further show that
PITs are effective at inhibiting PIP3/ARNO or GRP1 PH domain binding and their
membrane translocation, thereby suppressing ARF6 activation, which in turn contributes to
the inhibition of cancer cell migration. Several ARF GEF inhibitors have been previously
described. The activity of all known inhibitors is based on the direct or indirect inhibition of
protein-protein interaction by Sec7 domains of GEFs (Hafner et al., 2006; Renault et al.,
2003; Viaud et al., 2007). Overall, our work presents a new strategy based on the inhibition
of PH domain/phosphoinositide binding and suppression of the plasma membrane
translocation of GEFs. Conceptually, protein-lipid interactions may be more readily
targetable by chemical inhibitors compared to that of protein-protein interactions, which
frequently involve interactions of extended flat protein surfaces that are difficult to disrupt
by small molecules.

PIT-1 inhibits PIP3 binding to PH domains of GRP1/ARNO, and suppresses ARF6
activation
We have previously reported two distinct inhibitors of PIP3/PH domain binding through a
screen of ~50,000 diverse small molecules, which were termed PIT-1 and PIT-2 (Fig. 1A)
(Miao et al., 2010). They have been characterized as specific PIP3 antagonists with
selectivity towards a distinct sub-set of PIP3 specific PH domains (Miao et al., 2010). The
finding that PITs are able to inhibit PIP3 binding to PH domains of GRP1 and ARNO
attracted our interest because both GRP1 and ARNO are GEFs of ARF6, an GTPase playing
important roles in the regulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Importantly,

membrane translocation of these GEFs mediated by their PH domains’ binding to
phosphoinositides (Chardin et al., 1996; Jackson and Casanova, 2000) is necessary for the
efficient ARF6 activation (Cavenagh et al., 1996; Macia et al., 2004; Santy and Casanova,
2001; Yang et al., 1998). Consistent with our prior report (Miao et al., 2010), PIT-1 and
PIT-2 effectively inhibited PIP3 binding to PH domains of GRP1 and ARNO in
fluorescence polarization (FP) assay using recombinant GRP1 or ARNO PH domains and a
fluorescent TMR-labeled PIP3 molecule, while PIT-1i-1 and PIT-1i-2, two inactive analogs
of PIT-1, failed to inhibit the binding (Fig. 1B,C).

To confirm inhibition of the PH domain-dependent functions of these GEFs in the cells, we
performed a PH domain translocation assay that measures association of the GFP-fused PH
domains with the plasma membrane (Varnai et al., 2005). We used human breast carcinoma
SUM159 cells for most of the cellular experiments. Both PIT-1 and PIT-2 significantly
inhibited the membrane translocation of GRP1 and ARNO PH domains in response to
PDGF stimulation. Neither PIT-1i-1 nor PIT-1i-2 inhibited the translocation of GRP1 and
ARNO PH domains (Fig. 1D,E) (Miao et al., 2010). In contrast, PITs failed to inhibit
membrane localization/translocation of another ARF6 GEF, EFA6, which has a PH domain
with specificity towards PI(4,5)P2 (Macia et al., 2008) (Fig. 1D,E), consistent with their
preference towards PIP3-binding PH domains demonstrated in our previous study (Miao et
al., 2010). We next examined the effect of PITs on ARF6 activation using an active ARF6
pull-down and detection kit. We found that both PIT-1 and PIT-2 significantly suppressed
growth factor-stimulated ARF6 activation, consistent with the FP and membrane
translocation results. In contrast, PIT-1i-1 and PIT-1i-2 were again inactive, consistent with
the lack of inhibition of PIP3/PH domain binding by these molecules (Fig. 1F). Considering
that ARNO/GRP1 family proteins also use ARF1 as a substrate, we also examined the effect
of PITs on ARF1 activation. We found PITs also inhibited ARF1 activation, but to a much
lesser extent than that of ARF6 activation (Fig. 1F), which might due to the unique
membrane location-dependent activation for ARF6 versus cytosolic localization of ARF1.
PIT-1 inhibits actin remodeling, ruffling/lamellipodia formation and cell polarization

Author Manuscript

PIP3 is a key modulator in growth factor-stimulated actin remodeling and cell migration
(Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). Thus, we next examined whether PITs influence actin
organization and membrane ruffling. We found PDGF-stimulated ruffling was efficiently
inhibited by pre-incubation with either PIT-1 or PIT-2 (P<0.01). Confirming the specific
mechanism of this activity, no inhibition was observed for inactive PIT-1 analogs, PIT-1i-1
and PIT-1i-2 (Fig. 2A,B). Similar inhibition was also observed using SecinH3, an inhibitor
of GRP1/ARNO proteins (Hafner et al., 2006), which suggests that inhibition of ARF6
GEFs/ARF6 pathway may contribute to the inhibition of actin cytoskeleton dynamics by
PITs (Fig. S1A,B). Furthermore, treatment with PITs or SecinH3 significantly reduced the
amount of F-actin in the cells, including lamellipodia at the leading edge and stress fibers
within the cells (Fig. S1A,C), indicative of efficient inhibition of actin polymerization and
remodeling.
PITs also efficiently inhibited cell lamellipodia formation in a wound healing assay (Fig.
2C,D). Furthermore, we found that PITs’ treatment resulted in formation of a multiangular

radiative cell morphology instead of lamellipodia formed at cell edge in control. This
phenotypic change was induced by PIT-1, PIT-2 and SecinH3, but not by PIT-1i-1 and
PIT-1i-2 (Fig. S1C).
Dynamic cell polarization in response to extracellular signal gradients plays an important
role in mediating directional cell migration. In this regard, PIP3 is known to accumulate at
the leading edge and serve as a docking site for PH domain-containing proteins including
ARF6 GEFs-ARNO and GRP1, leading to the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and
formation of lamellipodia at the front edge (Wang et al., 2002). In wound healing assay,
both PIT-1 and PIT-2 were effective at preventing cell polarization induced by PDGF
stimulation, while both PIT-1i-1 and PIT-1i-2 failed to prevent cell polarization (Fig. 2C,E).
Treatment with PIT-1 also resulted in the efficient inhibition of fMLP-stimulated
polarization of differentiated HL-60 neutrophils (Fig. 2F,G).

GRP1/ARNO and ARF6 contribute to attenuation of lamellipodia formation by PIT-1

Author Manuscript

We next characterized the role of GRP1/ARNO-ARF6 to the inhibition of ruffling/
lamellipodia formation by PIT-1. We examined the effect of PITs on lamellipodia formation
in ARF6-overexpressing cells. Like ARAP3, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of ARF6,
both PIT-1 and PIT-2 significantly inhibited ARF6-induced lamellipodia formation.
Similarly, SecinH3 suppressed ARF6-induced lamellipodia formation (Fig. 3A,B). Notably,
the inhibition of lamellipodia formation by PITs and SecinH3 was accompanied by
acquisition of radial cell morphology (Fig. 3A). By contrast, neither PIT-1 and PIT-2, nor
SecinH3, inhibited lamellipodia formation triggered by overexpression of ARF6-Q67L, a
constitutively activated ARF6 mutant, which exists mainly in the GTP-bound state (P>0.05)
(Fig. 3C,D). Furthermore, the overexpression of ARF6-Q67L significantly abolished
morphological alterations induced by these compounds (Fig. 3C).

Author Manuscript

We next explored the contributions of GRP1/ARNO to inhibition of ruffling/lamellipodia
formation by PIT-1. GRP1 and ARNO-transfected cells displayed a significantly increased
number of peripheral lamellipodia/ruffles with PDGF stimulation. ARNO and GRP1induced changes were effectively suppressed by PIT-1 and PIT-2, as well as SecinH3, but
not by PIT-1i-1 and PIT-1i-2 (Fig. 4A,B), consistent with the inhibition of membrane
localization. As an additional control, PIT-1 and PIT-2 had no effect on lamellipodia
formation induced by overexpression of PIP2-specific EFA6. SecinH3 was similarly
inactive (P>0.05) (Fig. 4C,D), because of its specificity towards cytohesin family versus
EFA6 (Hafner et al., 2006). Furthermore, EFA6 efficiently overcame the inhibition of
ARF6-induced lamellipodia formation by PITs and SecinH3, while ARNO failed to do that
(Fig. 4E). These data are consistent with the inhibition of GRP1/ARNO-ARF6 contributing
to the suppression of actin remodeling and ruffling/lamellipodia formation by PITs.
PIT-1 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion
Cell motility is driven by actin rearrangement and lamellipodia formation at the leading edge
of cells (Frank et al., 1998b; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002). PIP3 affects these processes
through multiple PH-domain containing proteins, one important group of which are ARF6
GEFs such as GRP1 and ARNO (Caumont et al., 2000; Frank et al., 1998a; Frank et al.,

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 March 27.

1998b; Langille et al., 1999). The reduction of lamellipodia caused by PITs treatment led us
to examine whether PITs can reduce cellular migration and invasion.

Author Manuscript

As shown in Fig. 5A,C,D and Fig. S2A, PIT-1 substantially inhibited transwell migration of
multiple of human cancer cell lines. While PIT-1 can induce cell death (Miao et al., 2010),
inhibition of cell migration was observed at the concentrations of PIT-1 and time points
(several hours) insufficient to induce cell death. PIT-1 treatment had no significant cytotoxic
effects on the cells in parallel experiments under the same conditions (8 hr) used in
migration and invasion experiments (P>0.05) (Fig. S2B). Furthermore, PIT-1 at
concentrations of 6.25 and 12.5 μM which are inactive at killing cells even in 48 hr (P>0.05)
(Fig. S2C) could significantly suppress cell migration in 8 hr (P<0.01), implying that the
effect of PIT-1 on cell motility was not a consequence of cellular toxicity. Similar inhibition
of cell migration was observed in a wound healing assay (Fig. 5B,C,E). Consistent with the
specific mode of inhibition, PIT-2 also efficiently inhibited cell migration, while neither
PIT-1i-1 nor PIT-1i-2 were active (Fig. 5D,E). Moreover, both PIT-3 and PIT-4, two
analogs of PIT-1 with increased activity and specificity towards Akt/PDK1, but lacking
inhibition of GRP1 and ARNO displayed significantly reduced ability to inhibit cell
migration (Table S1, Fig. S2D). Furthermore, both PIT-1 and PIT-2 (but not PIT-1i-1 and
PIT-1i-2) also efficiently suppressed cancer cell invasion through matrigel (Fig. 5F,G, Fig.
S2E). Consistent with the inhibition of invasion, treatment of SUM159 cells with PIT-1
blocked the acquisition of invasive phenotype by the cells. Notably, this effect was
reversible, again indicating that it was not a consequence of cell death (Fig. 5H).
GRP1/ARNO-ARF6 contribute to suppression of cell migration by PIT-1

Author Manuscript

We next explored the contributions of GRP1/ARNO-ARF6 to cell migration inhibition led
by PIT-1. We first measured the effect of PITs on cell migration stimulated with ARF6. As
shown in Fig. 6A, overexpression of ARF6 led to an increase in cell migration. Both PIT-1
and PIT-2 inhibited migration of ARF6 overexpressing cells more effectively than that of
the control cells, consistent with the larger contribution of overexpressed ARF6 to cell
migration (Fig. 6B). To further confirm that inhibition of ARF6 contributes to inhibition of
cell migration by PIT-1, we measured migration of cells overexpressing constitutively
activated ARF6 mutant in the presence of PIT-1. We found that overexpression of ARF6Q67L indeed significantly attenuated inhibition of cell migration by PIT-1 (Fig. 6C).

Author Manuscript

We next examined the effect of PITs on cell migration stimulated with overexpressed GRP1
and ARNO. Overexpression of GRP1 or ARNO led to increased cell migration in wound
healing assay (Fig. 6D). Similar to the results in ARF6-overexpressing cells, both PIT-1 and
PIT-2 inhibited migration of GRP1 or ARNO overexpressing cells more effectively than that
of the control cells (Fig. 6E). In contrast, overexpression of EFA6 could overcome inhibition
of cell migration by PIT-1 (Fig. 6F). These data strongly support the notion that inhibition of
ARF6 through blocking the activity of its upstream GEFs contributes to actin changes and
attenuation of cell migration by PITs.

PIT-1 inhibits endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Endothelial cell migration plays a central role in tumor angiogenesis (Avraamides et al.,
2008). Considering the efficient inhibition of cancer cell migration by PITs, we also
examined whether these molecules may possess an additional anti-tumor modality via
suppressing migration of endothelial cells. First, we determined that PIT-1 and PIT-2, but
not the inactive analogs, efficiently suppressed actin reorganization and cell ruffling/
lamellipodia formation in endothelial cells (Fig. 7A,B), resulting in significant inhibition on
migration of HUVEC cells in both wound healing and transwell assays (Fig. 7C). No loss of
cell viability was observed under the experimental conditions (P>0.05) (Fig. S2F). Based on
these results, we next examined the ability of PIT-1 to attenuate angiogenesis in vitro using
endothelial tube formation and aortic ring assays. As shown in Fig. 7D,E, treatment with
PIT-1 resulted in efficient inhibition of tube formation. This effect was also observed with
PIT-2, but not with PIT-1i-1 (Fig. S3A-C). Microvessel growth from rat aorta sections is the
result of a combination of endothelial cell migration and tube formation, and thus provides a
close approximation of in vivo angiogenesis. Similar with tube formation assay, PIT-1
treatment remarkably suppressed microvessel outgrowth in aortic ring sprouting experiment
(Fig. 7D,F). Overall, these data suggest that PIT-1 is capable of blocking migration of both
cancer and endothelial cells, suggesting that this molecule may be capable of blocking both
cancer metastasis and angiogenesis.
PIT-1 and its analog-inhibition of in vivo cancer angiogenesis and metastasis

Author Manuscript

Considering the prominent inhibition of in vitro cell migration and angiogenesis by PITs, we
next determined if this could contribute to the anti-cancer effects of the previously described
dimethyl analog of PIT-1 (DM-PIT-1, Fig. 1A) in vivo (Miao et al., 2010). This analog was
used for in vivo experiments due to the improved delivery by loading into long-circulating
PEG-PE mixed micelles (DM-PIT-1-M) to facilitate in vivo bioavailability (Miao et al.,
2010). DM-PIT-1 inhibited binding of PIP3/GRP1 and ARNO PH domain comparably to
PIT-1 and did not display any significant differences from PIT-1 across a range of assays
used to characterize the PIT-1 (Fig. 1B-E, Fig. 2C-E, Fig. 4A,B,E, Fig. 6E-G, Fig. S1A,C,
Fig. S2G, Table S1).

Author Manuscript

First, we tested the effect of DM-PIT-1-M on experimental pulmonary metastasis formation
in vivo. Administration of DM-PIT-1-M (5 mg/kg/day) resulted in a significant suppression
on pulmonary metastasis formation of B16-F10 melanoma cells. Drug administration for 5
days resulted in 55.3% reduction in the number of pulmonary metastasis, when analyzed 18
days after melanoma cell injection. The mean number of metastatic colonies in micellar
DM-PIT-1 group was 36.6 compared with 81.8 colonies in the control group. The reduction
in metastasis was statistically significant (P<0.01) compared to both control and plain
micelle groups (no significant difference between control and plain micelles groups, P>0.05)
(Fig. 8A). Moreover, no significant loss in body weight or other signs of toxicity after 5 day
treatment (P>0.05), suggesting DM-PIT-1-M was well tolerated at the doses used in the
experiment (Fig. S3D).
Second, we have previously reported that administration of DM-PIT-1-M inhibited growth,
triggered cell death and suppressed Akt signaling in 4T1 syngeneic xenografts (Miao et al.,

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 March 27.

Miao et al.

2010). Considering the significant inhibitory effect of PIT-1 on angiogenesis in vitro, we
next examined the extent of angiogenesis in DM-PIT-1-treated tumors using
microvasculature marker CD31. The administration of DM-PIT-1-M resulted in a significant
attenuation of the number of CD31 loci in pulmonary metastasis tumors of B16-F10
melanoma cells (P<0.01). The DM-PIT-1 treatment induced a 72.1% reduction of CD31 loci
number compared with control group, reflecting the marked decrease in cancer angiogenesis
in vivo (Fig. 8B,C). Overall, these initial data suggest that DM-PIT-1 shows significant
effect in suppressing cancer angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo and may represent a
promising starting point for further optimization and characterization in tumor models in
vivo.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

PITs have been developed as small molecule antagonists of PIP3 binding to the Akt PH
domain (Miao et al., 2010). However, we also found that PITs display binding to several
additional PIP3-binding PH domains, involved in actin skeleton remodeling and cell
migration. Considering a well established role of PIP3 signaling in cell migration, this
prompted us to further investigate effects of PITs on these processes. In the current work, we
show that PITs suppress actin remodeling, ruffling/lamellipodia formation and cell
polarization, which leads to the inhibition of migration and invasion of cancer and
endothelial cells by PITs at noncytotoxic concentrations. In vitro activities of PIT-1 (DMPIT-1) translate into pronounced inhibition of in vivo tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. At
the same time, DM-PIT-1 is well tolerated upon systemic administration in mice. We also
extend our in vitro observations that PITs inhibit PIP3 binding by the PH domains of GRP1
amd ARNO, to show that PITs inhibit membrane translocation of these molecules, leading
to the inhibition of ARF6 activity in the cells. Inhibition of ARF6 contributes to the
suppression of actin rearrangement and cell migration and invasion by PITs. Overall, we
present a new approach to the regulation of PIP3-dependent migration through blocking
PIP3 binding by GEF proteins.

Author Manuscript

ARF6 is the only member of a family of class III ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) with
established role in regulation of cell cytoskeleton and migratory behavior (Balana et al.,
2005; Donaldson, 2003; Venkateswarlu et al., 1998). Among the 15 GEFs for ARF proteins,
only the ARNO/cytohesin family and EFA6 contain PH domains that regulate their
association with the plasma membrane through binding to phosphoinositides (Cox et al.,
2004). The higher specificity of these GEFs towards ARF6 is at least partially due to their
plasma membrane co-distribution with ARF6 (Cavenagh et al., 1996; Macia et al., 2004;
Santy and Casanova, 2001; Yang et al., 1998). Consistently, the mutant of ARNO lacking
PH domain failed to promote ARF6-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements (Frank et al.,
1998b). All of these data suggest that it may be possible to develop small molecule
inhibitors of GRP1/ARNO PH domain/phopshoinositides binding as ARF6 inhibitors and
potential anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic drug candidates. Our data show that PITs fit
into this role and are a promising starting point for future studies.
A number of observations support the specificity of PITs effects on cell migration and actin
cytoskeleton. Importantly, our data suggest that activity of PITs in cell migration and

invasion experiments parallels that of SecinH3. SecinH3 is a well characterized inhibitor of
ARNO/cytohesin family, which, unlike PITs targeting PIP3-dependent membrane
localization of GEFs, directly binds to the Sec7 domain of ARNO/cytohesin family GEFs,
leading to inhibition of ARFs (Hafner et al., 2006). Notably, we observed an additive effect
between PIT-1 and SecinH3 in suppression of cell migration (P<0.05, Fig. S2H). This is
consistent with different modes of GEFs’ inhibition by these molecules. In addition, we
show that inactive analogs of PIT-1, PIT-1i-1 and PIT-1i-2, lack activity towards ARF6 as
well as cell migration. Similarly, several additional PIT-1 analogs, which display increased
activity towards Akt and PDK1 and significantly increased cytotoxicity in the cells (Miao et
al., 2010), but reduced activity towards ARF6 GEFs, also display reduced inhibition of cell
migration (Table S1).

Our data suggest that ARF6 inhibition contributes to the effects of PIT-1 on cell motility.
However, the partial attenuation of PIT-1 inhibition of cell migration by ARF6-Q67L likely
means that other PIT targets may also play a role in these events. This is not unexpected,
because multiple additional PIP3 targets, such as Akt, PDK1 and GEFs for Rho GTPases
contribute to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Notably, the structure-activity relationship
data in Table S1 shows the reduction in the inhibition of migration by the more active and
specific Akt/PDK1 inhibitors suggest that, at least in SUM159 cells, Akt is not likely to
make major contributions to the inhibition of cell motility by PITs. As shown in Fig. S2J,
Akt inhibitor VIII exhibited the strongest inhibition on Akt phosphorylation, but it has much
weaker inhibition on cell migration compared with PIT-1 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002
(Fig. S2I). In contrast, PIT-1 efficiently inhibited cell migration at concentrations failed to
inhibit Akt phosphorylation (Fig. S2I, J). On the other hand, our initial studies show that
PITs could inhibit activation of Rac1, another key molecule in lamellipodia formation
(Ridley et al., 1992) (Fig. S3E). The inhibition of Rac1 activation by PITs might partially
result from inhibition of ARF6 activation considering that Rac1 is a potential downstream
molecule of ARF6 (Esteban et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2009). However, direct inhibition of PIP3
binding of PH domain-containing Rac1 GEFs, such as VAV2 and VAV3 (Hornstein et al.,
2004), is another possible mechanism, which will need to be explored in the future work.

Curiously, inhibition of migration occurs at a dose, which is several times lower than the one
required to inhibit PIP-PH domain binding of GRP1 or ARNO in vitro. One trivial
explanation could be that FP or any other similar assay utilizing bacterially expressed
isolated PH domains intrinsically cannot be expected to fully recapitulate complex
regulation of cellular full length proteins by PIP3 in its endogenous membrane context.
Thus, in vitro affinities calculated based on the FP data (Table S1) should be considered
with caution. The more likely possibility is that because PIP3 regulates a significant number
of factors involved in actin regulation, including GEFs for ARF6 as well as Rac1 family, it
is possible that even incomplete inhibition of each individual step may result in the
combined pronounced effect on actin remodeling and cell migration. It is also possible that
even though our data show that PITs inhibit GRP1 and ARNO functions in the cells, there
may exist additional endogenous PIT-1 targets among PIP3-binding GEFs, which might
have higher affinity to PIT-1 than that of either GRP1 or ARNO, further explaining high
activity of PITs. This needs to be explored in the future work.

While our data suggest that Akt inhibition does not contribute to the inhibition of cell
migration by PITs in vitro, it is also important to consider that angiogenesis is triggered by
hypoxia, which, in turn, decreases with reduction in tumor size. The number of observable
metastasis will also decline if cells die or fail to proliferate. Thus, in vivo inhibition of
angiogenesis and metastasis by DM-PIT-1 may reflect the combined effect of inhibition of
Akt, cell proliferation and tumor growth as well as the direct regulation of actin
cytoskeleton.

Dysregulation of PI3K signaling contributes to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis, including
changes in the regulation of cell survival, metabolism and cell motility. Therefore, it would
be attractive to be able to target multiple aspects of PI3K role in tumor development to
maximize anti-tumor effects. Our previous study showed that PITs can inhibit Akt PH
domain, leading to tumor cell death through apoptosis (Miao et al., 2010). Our current data
expands on this approach to show that PITs can also inhibit other PIP3 effectors such as
GRP1 and ARNO to achieve additional anti-cancer modalities, i.e. targeting cancer
angiogenesis and metastasis. At the same time, targeting PIP3 offers an important benefit of
controlling the classes of PI3K effectors targeted for inhibition. Our previous (Miao et al.,
2010) and current study show that PITs can be modified to achieve selective inhibition of
Akt PH domain. One of the important future directions is to further explore PIT-1/PIT-2
modifications leading to the selectivity towards ARF GEFs, as we have done for Akt
inhibitors. Such selective inhibitors will provide useful tools for dissecting the role of PIP3
in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton in vitro and in vivo. Tumor invasiveness and
formation of distal metastasis are the primary causes of patient death in many human
cancers. One of the important future directions is to further explore PIT-1/PIT-2
modifications leading to the selectivity towards ARF GEFs, as we have done for Akt

formation of distal metastasis are the primary causes of patient death in many human
cancers. Therefore, compounds that address these issues are important. Further development
of the drugs specifically targeting molecules, such as ARNO and GRP1, that are otherwise
non-toxic could be of high clinical value. Such molecules could be combined with current
chemotherapies or surgical approaches to achieve maximal therapeutic effect.

Cell migration assays

Author Manuscript

Transwell model—Migration of cancer and endothelial cells was evaluated using 24transwell Boyden chamber (Costar, Bedford, MA) with a polystyrene membrane (6.5 mm
diameter, 10 μm thickness, and 8 μm pore size). Cells were suspended in serum-free media
and seeded in the upper compartment of each well (5×104 cells/well) with or without
compounds. The lower compartment contained 600 μl of serum-free media supplemented
with fibronectin. After an 8-hr incubation at 37°C, cells were fixed and stained with 0.1%
crystal violet. Non-migrating cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed, and the
stained cells that migrated to the lower side were photographed using a microscope (Nikon,
Japan) in five random fields. Then cells were lysed with 10% acetic acid, and colorimetric
determination was made at 595 nm using Wallac Victor 3 plate reader.
Wound healing model—Cancer or endothelial cells were seeded into fibronectin-coated
96-well plates (2×104 cells/well). After reaching confluence, cell monolayers were scratched
with a pipette tip to obtain a “wound”. The media and dislodged cells were aspirated, and
replaced by fresh serum-free media with or without compounds. After an 8-hr incubation at
37°C, cells were photographed using a microscope in five random fields. The width of
wounded cell monolayers in images was measured and the inhibition rates of migration were
calculated.

Author Manuscript

Cell invasion assay—Cell invasion assay was performed using 24-transwell Boyden as
described above. The upper chamber was pre-coated with 1 mg/ml of matrigel (BD
Biosciences) for 4 hr at 37°C to form a basement membrane. The assays using SUM159
cells were performed and the results were analyzed as previously described for the transwell
assay.
Three-dimentional matrigel assay and analysis of the invasive morphology of SUM159 cells
was performed according to previous report (Simpson et al., 2004).

Cell polarization assays—SUM159 cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips.
After reaching confluence, cell monolayers were scratched with a pipette tip to obtain a
“wound” and were incubated for 2 hr in serum-free media with or without compounds. Then
cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and blocked with 5% normal serum for 30 min. For
detection of acetylated tubulin, cells were incubated with primary anti-acetylated tubulin
antibody (1:200) for 1 hr at room temperature, and then an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated

For HL-60 polarization analysis, HL-60 cells were differentiated with 1.3% DMSO for 6
days, and resuspended in HBSS medium containing 1.8% human serum albumin. The
compounds were added at indicated concentrations and incubated for 2 hr, followed by
stimulation with 100 nM fMLP for 3 min. Actin staining was performed as described above.
All images were obtained using Nikon TE2000 fluorescent microscope.
Tube formation assay—The tube formation assay was performed in 96-well plates.
Wells were pre-coated with 70 μl of the Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD
Biosciences) per well for 4 hr at 37°C. HUVEC were suspended in serum-free M199
medium and plated on Matrigel at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. PIT-1 was added at
indicated concentrations (3.125-100 μM). After an 8-hr incubation at 37°C, phase-contrast
images of the endothelial tubes were obtained using Nikon TE2000 microscope, and the
tube formation was assessed by counting the number of closed tubes in five random fields
from each well.

Aortic ring assay—The aortas were isolated from 6-week old Sprague-Dawley rats and
immediately transferred to a culture dish with serum-free medium. The fibroadipose tissue
around the aortas was carefully removed and the aortas were cut into 1-mm long aortic ring
fragments. After three consecutive washes in serum-free medium, the aortic rings were
embedded into 70 μl Matrigel in 96-well plate and fed with 100 μl of serum-free M199
medium with or without PIT-1 at different concentrations (3.125-100 μM). The medium was
replaced every 24 hr. Phase-contrast images were obtained on day 6, and the numbers of
microvessel outgrowths per ring were counted.

Transient transfection—SUM159 cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plate at a
density of 5×104 cells/well and incubated overnight. Then transient transfection was carried
out using TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirrus Bio) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. Twenty-four hr after transfection, cells were subjected to translocation or
wound healing or fluorescent immunocytochemistry analysis with or without compound
treatment or growth factors stimulation.
Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay—Briefly, Akt, GRP1 and ARNO PH domain
(100 nM) were incubated with TMR-labeled PIP3 (60 nM) in the buffer containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM b-ME for 40 min at 15°C in the dark with or

ARF6, ARF1 and Rac1 activation assays—SUM159 cells were serum starved
overnight, and treated with different compounds at a variety of concentrations, followed by
stimulation with 100 ng/ml PDGF for 15 min. Next, cells were rinsed once with PBS, and 1
ml lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 1 mM
DTT, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin and 1 mM
PMSF) was added per plate. The cells were scraped and transferred to a microcentrifuge
tube, vortexed briefly and incubated on ice for 5 min, followed by a centrifugation at
16,000×g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected. A sample of the lysate was used
to test the total protein level of ARF6, ARF1 or Rac1. Next, 700 μl lysate, 50 μl glutathione
resin and 100 μg GST-GGA3-PBD (for ARF6 and ARF1) or GST-Pak1-PBD (for Rac1)
were mixed together, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 hr with gentle
rocking. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and the proteins were
eluted by boiling beads in 50 μl of the 2×SDS sample buffer at 95-100°C for 5 min. The
samples were subjected to western blot analysis using anti-ARF6, anti-ARF1 or anti-Rac1
monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) (BD Biosciences).
Suppression of in vivo cancer metastasis
Animals: Male C57BL/6 mice, 6-8 weeks old at time of arrival, were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories. Animals were housed in sterilized cages and were provided sterile food
and water. Animals were acclimated up to two weeks before tumor cells inoculation. All
procedures using mice were approved by the Northeastern University Animal Care and Use
Committee according to established guidelines.

Cell culture and animal tumor model: Subculture of primary B16-F10 cells was isolated
from mouse metastatic lungs (experimental lung metastasis model), also named B16-F10L1. Subconfluent proliferating cells at passage #7 were harvested by trypsinization and
resuspended in DMEM medium at a concentration of 1.0×106 cells/ml. 100 μl of cell
suspension was injected intravenously (i.v.) into the lateral tail vein of C57BL/6 mice for
induction of experimental lung metastasis. Randomization of mice was based on their body
weights. A total of 21 mice were divided into three groups: control, plain micelles and
micellar DM-PIT-1 (DM-PIT-1-M). The control group received PBS injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.). Mice in the third group were treated i.p. for 5 consecutive days with
a daily injection of 5 mg/kg of micellar DM-PIT-1. The plain PEG-PE micelles were
prepared using the same lipid component, and used at the same concentration as DM-PIT-1loaded micelles to the second group. The drug treatment was started 24 hr after tumor
inoculation. The body weights of mice were measured at last.
To monitor the lung colonization, mice were euthanized on day 14 and their lungs were
harvested and examined for colonies. Nodules of the metastatic tumor lesions in the lungs
were carefully counted by visual inspection and photographed using a Conon PowerShot
SD780 IS camera. Metastases, which were visible on the lung surface, were counted and
