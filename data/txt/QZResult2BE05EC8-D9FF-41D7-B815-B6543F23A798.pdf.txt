Abstract
Arsenic is a well-established human carcinogen that is
chronically consumed in drinking water by millions of people
worldwide. Recent evidence has suggested that arsenic is a
genotoxic carcinogen. Furthermore, we have shown that
mitochondria mediate the mutagenic effects of arsenic in
mammalian cells, as arsenic did not induce nuclear mutations
in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)–depleted cells. Using the
human-hamster hybrid AL cells, we show here that arsenic
alters mitochondrial function by decreasing cytochrome c
oxidase function and oxygen consumption but increasing
citrate synthase function. These alterations correlated with
depletion in mtDNA copy number and increase in large
heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions. In addition, mtDNA isolated
periodically from cultures treated continuously with arsenic
did not consistently display the same deletion pattern,
indicating that the mitochondrial genome was subjected to
repeated and continuous damage. These data support the
theory that the mitochondria, and particularly mtDNA, are
important targets of the mutagenic effects of arsenic in
mammalian cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5239–47]

Introduction
Arsenic is an important environmental carcinogen that affects
millions of people worldwide. In West Bengal, India, and
Bangladesh alone, more than 35 million people are believed to be
exposed to an arsenic concentration in drinking water exceeding
50 Ag/L, the maximum allowable limit in Bangladesh (1). In
contrast, the current limit in the United States and member
countries of the European Union is 10 Ag/L. Individuals chronically
exposed to arsenic develop a range of diseases: initially keratosis
of the skin and subsequently other deleterious neurologic and
cardiovascular effects (2). Importantly, arsenic is also a known
human carcinogen, and exposed individuals have a higher risk of
developing skin, lung, liver, kidney, and bladder cancers (2).
Although epidemiologic studies have clearly identified arsenic as
a human carcinogen, the mechanism by which arsenic causes
cancer is still poorly understood (3). Given the large number of
contaminated sites that have been identified worldwide and the

scores of millions of people at risk, there is an urgent need to
understand how arsenic mediates tumorigenesis.
Previous work from our laboratory has clearly established that
arsenic is a chromosomal mutagen, even after short (1–5 days)
treatment times (4), and that normal mitochondrial function is
required for the genotoxic response to arsenic (5). Mitochondria
are the energy-generating organelles of the cell, and structural and
function abnormalities in mitochondria have been shown in cancer
cells (6). Furthermore, mitochondria are a rich source of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and arsenic-induced genotoxic effects are
also dependent on ROS (4, 7, 8). Taken together, this suggests a
potential mechanism for arsenic-induced genotoxicity whereby
arsenic disrupts mitochondrial function that leads to an increase in
intracellular ROS, a subsequent downstream induction of reactive
nitrogen species, and an increased mutagenic potential, either
directly or via a decreased DNA repair capacity.
Mitochondria contain their own extra-nuclear DNA (mtDNA),
which is a potentially susceptible target of various environmental
mutagens/carcinogens, including the free radicals induced by the
exposure of cells to ionizing radiation, asbestos fibers, and arsenic.
This circular genome lacks protective histones, has only a subset
of the DNA repair systems available to nuclear DNA (nDNA), and
exists inside the organelle in an environment of high oxidative
stress (9). Consequently, the mutation rate of mtDNA is greatly
increased compared with nDNA (8), and an increase in the ROS
burden induced by arsenic exposure could further increase the rate
of mutation.
In humans, the incidence of a 4,977-bp deletion in mtDNA
known as the ‘‘common deletion’’ increases with age (10, 11).
Additionally, the occurrence of this deletion was four times greater
in oral tissues of individuals who chewed areca nut, a major risk
factor for oral and esophageal cancer, and the deletion was also
induced in neuronal cells exposed to the mutagen ethidium
bromide (12, 13). Furthermore, major mtDNA deletions have been
identified in human prostate and breast cancers as well as
numerous smaller deletions in a variety of other tumors (14–16).
An individual cell contains hundreds of mitochondria, each
containing multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome (8). In
addition to deletions, it is possible that a reduction in the copy
number of mtDNA could alter mitochondrial function, which may
also lead to increased cellular ROS. Interestingly, impairment
of DNA repair and increased oxidative damage to the nuclear
genome have been reported in cells depleted of mtDNA (17, 18).
Furthermore, we have previously shown an increase in background
nuclear mutations in mtDNA-depleted (U0) cells (5). Finally, all
these mtDNA alterations may result in changes in mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and the emergence of the
glycolytic phenotype over OXPHOS, a hallmark of cancer cells, may

be promoted by mitochondrial dysfunction (19). Therefore, we
investigated the consequences of arsenic treatment on mitochondrial function and the role of mtDNA changes in mediating these
effects.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The AL human-hamster hybrid cells, CHOK1 cells stably
expressing a single copy of human chromosome 11, were used in these
studies. Chromosome 11 encodes the CD59 cell surface antigen that renders
AL cells sensitive to killing by specific monoclonal antibodies in the
presence of rabbit serum complement as described previously (4, 5). Cells
were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium, supplemented with 8% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 Ag/mL gentamicin, and 2 normal
glycine (2  10 4 mol/L), at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator and
passaged as described (4, 5).
Histochemistry. Histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase
(COX) activity was done as described (20). Briefly, cells grown on glass
coverslips were air-dried for 1 h at room temperature and preincubated
with 1 mmol/L CoCl2 and 50 AL of DMSO in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6),
containing 10% sucrose, for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed
with PBS and incubated for 6 h at 37jC with 10 mL of substrate solution

[10 mg cytochrome c, 10 mg diaminobenzidine, 2 mg catalase, and 25 AL
DMSO in 10 mL of 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.6)]. The coverslips
were rinsed, mounted in glycerin-gelatin, and examined with a Zeiss
microscope with bright-field optics.
Histochemistry staining was quantified by using Image J (NIH) software.
Light and camera settings were standardized to get the absorbance
boundary of 0 to 249 ( from dark to white). Twenty-four bit color images
were captured with 40 objective. Background subtraction was done on
each image based on an empty field adjacent to the cell. All the samples
were evaluated using the same threshold settings. The absorbance was
acquired by averaging the quantitative computerized image analysis data
obtained from at least 23 randomly selected cells from each sample.
Statistical analysis was done with the Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in growth
medium until confluent and fixed (PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min)
and permeabilized (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min). Cells were incubated
with antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase (Binding Site, United Kingdom).
Mitochondria were visualized with secondary antibodies from Amersham.
Nuclear staining was done with propidium iodide (PharMingen). Images
were captured using a laser confocal microscope (Nikon). Analysis of tubulin
in cells was done as described previously (21). Briefly, cells were fixed ( 20jC
methanol, 10 min) and rehydrated in PBS for 5 min and stained with and

formation in arsenic-treated cells. Images of five random fields were captured at low power (20 objective). Total number of nuclei was determined using Image J (NIH)
software, and those with micronuclei were scored manually.

antibody to tyrosinated tubulin (a gift from G. Gundersen, Columbia
University). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Determination of COX and citrate synthase activity. Biochemical
assays for COX and citrated synthase activity were done as described (20).
Briefly, cells in log phase of growth were trypsinized and washed with PBS,
and the pellets were resuspended in reaction buffer [50 mmol/L potassium
phosphate (pH 7.0)]. Cells were lysed with two cycles of freezing and
thawing. Cell lysates were treated with 1.3 mmol/L lauryl maltoside before
COX measurements. COX activity was assessed by measuring the oxidation
of reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm (nmol oxidized cytochrome c per min
per mg protein). Citrate synthase activity was assessed by measuring the
reduction of 5,5¶-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm, coupled to the
reduction of CoA by the citrate synthase reaction in the presence of
oxaloacetate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mmol/L
oxaloacetate, and the absorbance change is monitored for 2 min at 30jC.
The enzyme activities were normalized to mg of protein in the cell lysate.
Oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption in intact cells was assayed
as described previously (22). Briefly, 1  107 cells were suspended in 1.5 mL
of DMEM lacking glucose, and oxygen concentration was assayed over
3 min at 37jC in a Hansatech (MA) Clark’s oxygen electrode unit.
Long-extension PCR. Total genomic DNA was extracted from
exponentially growing cells according to standard techniques. Longextension PCR was done with 50 ng of template, using LA-Taq (Takara) in
a total volume of 50 AL. Samples were denatured for 5 min at 95jC followed
by 30 cycles of 10 s at 98jC, 16 min at 68jC, and a final elongation for

10 min at 72jC. Forward primer, CGTAGAGTATGCTGCAGGCCCATTCGCAC (bp 3368–3396); reverse primer, GTCTTACGCAATTTCCGGGCTCTGCCACC (bp 2692–2663). These PCR primers were designed specifically to
amplify 15,608 bp of the mtDNA, skipping only 676 bp of the NADH1 gene.
To exclude the possibility of amplifying nuclear mtDNA pseudogenes, we
did the reaction on DNA from cells lacking mtDNA (U0 cells) to ensure that
no mtDNA-like sequences were amplified. Long-extension PCR products
were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide.
Real-time PCR. mtDNA copy number was determined by real-time PCR
using SYBR Green detection on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). Products amplified were a 207-bp fragment of
the nuclear encoded 18S rRNA gene (23) and a 199-bp fragment of the
mtDNA encoded 12S rRNA gene (24). The primers were as follows: 18S
sense, AAGCTTGCGTTGATTAAGTCC; 18S antisense, TAATGATCCTTCCGCAGGTTC; 12S sense, GGGTTGGTAAATTTCGTGCCAGC; and 12S antisense, CCCAGTTTGGATCTTAGCTATC. All reactions were done in
triplicate. PCR conditions were as follows: 95jC for 15 min followed by
40 cycles at 95jC for 30 s, 55jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s. Relative
quantification of mtDNA/nDNA ratio was determined by comparative
threshold cycle (C T) method as described previously (25).
Detection of rare heteroplasmic deletions using nested PCR. A
nested PCR protocol for detecting rare heteroplasmic deletions was adapted
from the methods developed for detecting the common deletion in human
mtDNA (26). The polymer used was Ex-Taq (Takara). PCR conditions were

as follows: denaturation for 5 min at 95jC followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
95jC, 30 s at 55jC, and 30 s at 68jC, and a final elongation for 10 min at
72jC. Primer sets: (a) first round (5070S, CATCTAATGAGTGCAAATCAATTAC + 11775AS, CAGGTAAGGTCAATAGAATAAAAATAAGG); second round
(5700S, GCATTCCCACGTATAAACAACATAAGC + 11387AS, GTGGTGTTAACGTACCTCGTTGAG); (b) first round (6123S, GGTATAGTGTGAGCAATAATGTCAATCGG + 14617AS, GTCTACAGAGAATCCCCCTCAG);
second round (6716S, CTTCATAATCTGAGAAGCTTTCGC + 14154AS,
GCGGGTGTTTTTTTCGTATGATTGTC). Template concentrations were
accurately determined using both spectrophotometric measurements and
by normalizing, with serial dilutions, the intensity of ethidium bromide
staining of genomic DNA in agarose gels. All deletions amplified were
sequenced to determine the break points.

Results
Arsenic induced nDNA mutagenesis. To more accurately
replicate normal environmental exposure conditions, we subjected
cells to relatively long periods of arsenic exposure while using
lower arsenic treatment levels than we had used in previous
studies. Consequently, we treated cells with arsenic doses of 1, 0.5,
and 0.25 Ag/mL for up to 60 days and monitored genotoxicity
(CD59 mutations) in the human-hamster AL cells (CHO cells
stably expressing human chromosome 11). Consistent with

previously observed mutation data, treatment of cells for 16 or
30 days resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mutation
frequency (Fig. 1A and B), measured by the loss of the CD59 cell
surface antigen, which is encoded by human chromosome 11 (4).
This increase was also time dependent, as there was an increase in
total mutations in response to increasing treatment time.
Concurrently, there was a substantial increase in the background
mutation rate, particularly after 60 days, which prevented precise
quantification of the effect of long treatment time on CD59
mutations. Arsenic treatment also caused an almost 3-fold increase
in the number of micronuclei observed in AL cells (untreated,
11.6 F 2.2%; treated, 32.6 F 1.9%) treated for 60 days (Fig. 1C
and D). Thus, arsenic exposure also resulted in genomic instability,
providing further evidence that arsenic is a chromosomal mutagen.
Mitochondrial oxidative function. Given our previous findings
that normal mitochondrial function was required to mediate the
genotoxicity of arsenic (5), we initially analyzed changes in the
morphology of the mitochondria in AL cells after arsenic treatment
by staining cells with an antibody against the mitochondrial
enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. When examined by fluorescence
microscopy, the mitochondria of untreated cells maintained a
compact, punctate structure in the perinuclear region with an
approximately uniform number of mitochondria from cell to cell

(Fig. 2A). In contrast, cultures exposed to 1 Ag/mL arsenic for
60 days had a distribution of mitochondria that varied considerably
between cells and exhibited a dramatically elongated or filamentous morphology (Fig. 2C). This extended mitochondrial morphology was also evident in cells stained histochemically for COX after
only 15 days of arsenic exposure (Fig. 3B, arrow). We quantified this
change in morphology by capturing images of randomly chosen
fields and scoring the numbers of cells displaying an elongated,
filamentous mitochondrial structure. In untreated cultures, only 6%
of cells (SD, 7%) displayed an elongated mitochondrial morphology
(6 fields, 230 cells), whereas for arsenic-treated cells 66% of cells
(SD, 29%; P < 0.01, Student’s t test) had this morphology (10 fields,
263 cells).
Arsenic treatment has been shown to degrade the microtubule
aster (27, 28), and mitochondrial transport uses microtubules as
‘‘rails’’ and the associated microtubule motor proteins for motility,
at least in mammalian cells (29, 30). It was possible that the
degradation of the microtubule cytoskeleton would also alter
mitochondrial phenotype within cell. However, we were unable to
identify any gross phenotypic changes in the microtubule
cytoskeleton in chronically treated cells (Fig. 2B and D).
Having identified a change in mitochondrial phenotype, we
examined the effect of arsenic on mitochondrial metabolic activity.
COX is a 13-subunit enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial
membrane (29). Also known as complex IV in the respiratory chain,
COX activity is routinely used as a measure of mitochondrial
metabolic function. Interestingly, histochemical analysis of cells
treated with arsenic for 15 days revealed a reduction in COX staining

www.aacrjournals.org

compared with control cells (Fig. 3A and B), indicating that
mitochondrial respiration was reduced after arsenic treatment. To
quantify the histochemical data, we analyzed the absorbance of at
least 23 randomly chosen cells from images of treated and untreated
samples. After subtracting the background, the average absorbance
(F SD) of images of untreated cells was 1.9 (F 0.2) times greater than
for treated cells, indicating that untreated cells stained more heavily
for COX, suggesting greater activity.
We next assayed biochemically COX activity on lysates from
clonal isolates of arsenic-treated and untreated AL cells. Significantly, COX activity was reduced by almost 45% after sodium
arsenite treatment for 60 days (Fig. 3C). This confirmed our
histochemical data and indicated that exposure to the metalloid
reduced mitochondrial respiratory function. To further confirm
that arsenite treatment compromised mitochondrial function,
we assayed oxygen consumption in both control and arsenitetreated (1 Ag/mL for 60 days) AL cells. Compared with nontreated
controls, there was a 36% decrease in oxygen consumption among
arsenite-treated AL cells (Fig. 3C). As expected, U0 AL cells with
depleted mtDNA had extremely low rates of oxygen consumption,
12 times less than wild-type AL cells.
COX is the final enzyme in the respiratory chain and is
composed of both nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded proteins.
Thus, we compared the activity of citrate synthase, a wholly
nuclear encoded mitochondrial matrix enzyme that is a measure of
mitochondrial mass (31), with COX activity in the same lysates.
Unexpectedly, there was a reciprocal increase in citrate synthase
activity in response to arsenic treatment (Fig. 3C).

in numbered bands are given in Table 1.

mtDNA alterations. COX is a complex with 3 of its 13 subunits
encoded by mtDNA (32). It was possible that the decrease in COX
activity after arsenic treatment resulted from mtDNA damage.
There are at least two ways in which mtDNA could be altered after
arsenic treatment: by depleting the copy number or by deleting
sections of the genome. In an initial screen to identify mtDNA
deletions, we used long-extension PCR to amplify almost the entire
16,284-bp AL cell mitochondrial genome. However, fragments
shorter than wild-type mtDNA (less than f16 kb) were not
detected (Fig. 4A), indicating that any deletions were likely to be
heteroplasmic, affecting only a small fraction of the mtDNA copies
present in the cell and, therefore, not detectable.
Surprisingly, even after shorter treatment time (15 days), there
was a substantial decrease in ethidium bromide staining of the
long-extension mtDNA PCR product in AL cells treated with 1 Ag/
mL arsenic compared with untreated samples or cells treated with
lower doses (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 9), despite using equivalent
quantities of template DNA. This suggested that mtDNA copy
number may be reduced. To confirm this result, we did real-time
quantitative PCR. Segments from both mtDNA and nDNA were
amplified, and the relative mtDNA to nDNA ratio was assessed in
arsenic-treated cells compared with untreated controls. The two
fragments amplified were from the hamster 12S rRNA gene, a
highly conserved region of the mitochondrial genome (24), and a
segment of the nuclear-encoded 18S rRNA gene (23). Interestingly,
after 60 days of arsenic treatment, mtDNA copy number was
reduced to <65% of untreated levels. This effect was dose
dependent and was observed in cells exposed to arsenic
concentration of 0.5 Ag/mL. mtDNA copy number was also
reduced in cells treated with arsenic at 0.25 Ag/mL, although the
effect at this dose was not statistically significant (Fig. 4B).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

Having confirmed changes in mtDNA after arsenic exposure,
we used a more sensitive method to detect rare heteroplasmic
mtDNA deletions. In humans, a PCR-based technique had been
developed to detect heteroplasmic deletions that exploited the
physical characteristics of a circular mtDNA molecule containing
a large deleted fragment (26). Primer annealing sites in the wildtype mitochondrial genome that were thousands of base pairs
apart would be substantially closer together after deletion of the
intervening sequence and re-circularization of the genome. Using
short extension times (30 s), it has been shown that the
sequences flanking the deleted fragment would be selectively
amplified even when present as a fraction of the total mtDNA
copy number.
In humans, the vast majority of mtDNA deletions that have been
identified thus far occur between tandem repeats, including the
‘‘common’’ deletion (33).4 In addition, 85% of the deletions flanked
by direct repeats observed in humans are contained completely
within the major arc (the larger, f11,000 bp, of the two sequences
between OH and OL in the circular mitochondrial genome; ref. 33).
In hamster mtDNA, there are a large number of repeats in the
major arc of 11 bp or longer (Supplementary Table S1). Using a pair
of nested primer sets, the PCR procedure for detecting the
‘‘common’’ deletion in humans was adapted to hamster mtDNA in
an attempt to identify large deletions.
Duplicate cultures were exposed to 0.25, 0.5, and 1 Ag/mL
arsenic for 30 days and analyzed for deletions using two different

sets of nested primers. Surprisingly, after arsenic exposure large
heteroplasmic deletions were detected by PCR amplification of
fragments in AL cell mtDNA that were not found in untreated cells
(Fig. 5A). These results were further confirmed by sequencing
the PCR products (Table 1). Deletions were observed even after
short (24 h) treatment times with relatively low concentrations
(0.25 Ag/mL) of arsenic (Table 1). Unexpectedly, when we
repeatedly assayed a single DNA sample extracted from an exposed
culture, we identified many different deletion products (Table 1),
indicating that multiple, possibly single copy, deletions were
induced by arsenic treatment. Consistent with this finding, the
DNA from the same continuously cultured cells when analyzed

after 60 days of arsenic exposure displayed deletions that were not
detected after 30 days of treatment (Fig. 5B). Deletions were also
not detected in arsenic-treated U0 AL cells, indicating that they
were not due to pseudogenes present in nDNA (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we observed a reduction in mtDNA copy number,
an increased incidence of large heteroplasmic deletions, a
reduction of COX activity, and an increase in citrate synthase
activity, indications that mitochondrial replication and function
were abnormal after arsenic treatment. This suggests that exposed

cells have moved from an oxidative toward a glycolytic metabolic
state. Interestingly, the Warburg theory, advanced many decades
ago (6), implies that cancer cells also have impaired mitochondrial
function and increased glycolysis. In addition, the ‘‘mitochondrial
dysfunction hypothesis’’ contends that the three deleterious
features (increased oxidative stress, energy deprivation, and
mtDNA damage) contribute to a degenerative cycle and thus
compound the effect of each of the other factors individually (18).
At least two of these factors, increased ROS and mtDNA depletion,
have been previously implicated in DNA damage and genotoxicity
after arsenic exposure (4, 17). In addition to our previous work, we
have now shown here that all three factors (including mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA depletion, and induction of mtDNA
deletions) are observed after arsenic treatment of cells, and it is
possible that a related degenerative cycle of mitochondrial
dysfunction may contribute to the carcinogenicity of arsenic in
humans. These data support the theory that the mitochondria, and
particularly mtDNA, are important mediators of the mutagenic
effects of arsenic in mammalian cells.
It should be noted that although the concentrations of arsenic in
this study are high compared with average exposure levels observed
in affected communities, in Bangladesh and parts of West Bengal,
India, >30% of drinking wells have arsenic levels greater than
100 Ag/L, and 5% to 10% of wells have levels between 200 and
1,000 Ag/L (2, 34). These concentrations are well within the dosage
range used in the experiments reported here. In addition, the
experiments in this study were conducted for at most 60 days, a
dramatically shorter period than the chronic exposure experienced
in affected communities. Consequently, we believe that the arsenic
levels used here effectively simulate conditions that are environmentally relevant.
Our initial experiments confirmed that arsenic was a genotoxic
mutagen and also induced genomic instability, measured by an
increase in micronuclei (5). The induction of micronuclei had been
previously observed in free radical–sensitive cells exposed to very
high arsenic concentrations (35). Our analysis revealed an increase
in micronuclei in normal cells after arsenic treatment at much
lower doses, reinforcing the concept that arsenic is a potent
chromosomal mutagen. In comparison with our previous studies of
arsenic-treated AL cells, there was a modest increase in survival
fraction and a reduction in mutation yield (4). It is possible that the
serial passaging required to continuously treat cells for more than
1 week may have affected these results, as could variability in
complement used in the mutation assay.
In addition to examining nuclear genotoxicity, we wanted to
understand the effects of arsenic on mitochondrial respiratory
chain function and, in particular, whether arsenic induced damage
in mtDNA. Histochemical analysis of COX activity revealed a
decrease in staining of arsenic-treated cells, suggesting a reduced
respiratory chain function. This was confirmed by biochemical
analysis that showed that COX activity was decreased by nearly
45% after arsenic treatment. This was consistent with our previous
observation that arsenic induced the formation of peroxynitrites
(5), as these molecules inhibit COX (complex IV), as well as
complexes I, II, and V (36). Arsenic treatment also reduced oxygen
consumption in chronically exposed AL cells, supporting the
evidence of reduced COX activity. A reduced rate of oxygen
consumption has previously been reported in cells treated acutely
with arsenic as well as in chronically exposed animals (37, 38).
We also examined citrate synthase activity, an enzyme that is
encoded by nuclear genes and found that the effect of arsenic on the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

enzyme was the reciprocal of the effect on COX. Citrate synthase
activity is inhibited by ATP, thus providing an important regulatory
mechanism to control the citric acid cycle (39). In arsenic-treated
cells that had decreased COX activity, ATP production (the end
product of the electron transport chain) was likely to be reduced.
Consequently, the relative reduction in ATP concentration in these
cells may have resulted in a compensatory increase in citrate
synthase activity compared with controls.
We and others have shown that direct mutations to specific
nuclear genes (CD59), as well as genomic instability (micronucleus
formation), was clearly induced by arsenic exposure, and these
effects could be ameliorated by reducing the levels of ROS in the
cell (4, 35). These findings, combined with the decrease in COX
activity in arsenic-treated cells, prompted us to examine the
integrity of the mitochondrial genome.
There were a number of ways in which mtDNA could be altered,
one of which was a reduction in the copy number. There are many
hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome in any given cell,
and a reduction in copy number may affect the expression level of
the three COX subunits encoded by mtDNA. This, in turn, could
alter the activity of complex IV as a whole, which may increase the
level of ROS. Significantly, there was evidence that cancer cells
(HeLa) with depleted mtDNA have impaired DNA repair capacity
and increased oxidative damage to the nuclear genome (17). These
results were reinforced by our previous findings of increased
background CD59 mutation levels in U0 AL cells, a CHO-derived,
non-tumor cell line (5).
In our experiments, we observed a clear decrease in the ratio of
mtDNA to nDNA when cells were treated with 1 Ag/mL arsenic.
After longer-term exposures (up to 60 days), cells displayed a
dose-dependent reduction of mtDNA copy number, indicating
that lower concentrations of arsenic, more similar to the average
environmental exposure levels experienced in drinking water, also
caused a reduction in copy number. It has been reported that
mRNA expression of DNA polymerase-g, the polymerase responsible for the replication and repair of mtDNA, is substantially
reduced in arsenic-treated cultures, and this could account for the
reduction in mtDNA (40). Alternatively, the reduction of mtDNA
copy number may be a consequence of the increase in free radicals
in exposed cultures. ROS-induced damage to DNA polymerase-g,
in addition to a decrease in mRNA expression, could have further
impaired replication of the mitochondrial genome, thus reducing
the copy number. In support of this concept, it has been
established that DNA polymerase-g is susceptible to oxidative
damage in vitro (41).
Perhaps the most interesting finding of this work was the
evidence that large heteroplasmic deletions in the mitochondrial
genome were induced by arsenic exposure. The genome was
apparently subjected to repeated damage, as a number of unique
deletions were detected in mtDNA from each sample, as well as
mtDNA extracted at different times from the same continuously
cultured cell line. Furthermore, the observation that mtDNA
deletions were present after 24 h of exposure was consistent
with our previous observations that arsenic-induced nuclear genotoxicity occurred within 24 h (4, 5).
Of the deletions identified, less than one third (11 of 38) were
located adjacent to tandem repeats. However, in humans, the vast
majority of identified deletions are flanked by tandem repeats.4
This discrepancy may be accounted for by the fact that deletions
flanked by tandem repeats are more likely to be propagated to
higher percentage levels in an individual cell and hence become

fixed, and therefore more readily detectable in humans, whereas
other deletions are repaired/degraded or not amplified. The
detection of deletions in arsenic-treated cells likely reveals an
increase in the incidence of these mutations after exposure, not
their complete absence in unexposed cells. The ability to detect
deletions in treated cells may be explained by a number of factors:
increased ROS resulting in more double-strand breaks, decreased
DNA repair capacity or a lower mitotic index, as human tissues
with a low mitotic index have an increased incidence of the
common deletion (42, 43). Regardless of the mechanism by which
deletions were induced, our data indicate that the mitochondrial
genome was subjected to repeated and continuous damage when
exposed to arsenic.

Arsenic is an important environmental contaminant that affects
millions of people worldwide. Our present findings illustrate that
mitochondria are a primary target in arsenic toxicity and provide a
basis for better interventional approach in both treatment and
prevention of arsenic-induced human diseases.
