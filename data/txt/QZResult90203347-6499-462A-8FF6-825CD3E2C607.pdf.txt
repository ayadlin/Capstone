ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is a main urological disease associated with significant morbidity
and mortality. Radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy are potentially curative for
localized prostate cancer, while androgen deprivation therapy is the initial systemic
therapy for metastatic prostate disease. However, despite temporary response, most
patients relapse and evolve into castration resistant cancer.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex gradual process that occurs
during embryonic development and/or tumor progression. During this process, cells
lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire mesenchymal features. Increasing
evidences indicate that EMT promotes prostate cancer metastatic progression and it
is closely correlated with increased stemness and drug resistance.
In this review, we discuss the main molecular events that directly or indirectly
govern the EMT program in prostate cancer, in order to better define the role and the
mechanisms underlying this process in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic
resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Surgery represents a valid tool for the treatment of
localized prostate cancer. Nevertheless, nearly all prostate
cancer-associated mortality is caused by distant metastasis.
The main therapeutic option for advanced prostate tumors

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common
cause of cancer-related deaths in male population [1].

treatment depends on androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) with limited clinical outcomes. Although the
initial response rate is high, the therapeutic benefits are
short-lived, and, within 18-24 months, the treated patients
progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC), an androgen-insensitive disease, for which
curative therapy is not available [2]. Therefore, the CRPC
represents a critical demanding task for the prostate cancer
cure. A greater comprehension of the molecular apparatus
involved in PCa distant metastasis formation and
metastatic castration-resistance is of critical importance to
develop novel therapeutic approaches.
Recently, several evidences of epithelialmesenchymal plasticity playing a role in both PCa
metastatic progression and treatment resistance have
been reported [3,4]. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) has been initially defined as a complex molecular
process required during the embryonic development for
morphogenetic changes [5]. Therefore, epithelial cells
heavily depend on a very fine tuned and highly regulated
EMT program, which converts them into a mesenchymal
state. Different factors, including microenvironment
molecules able to accommodate cellular and tissue growth
in normal or altered conditions, along with epithelial and
stromal settings, are then required for achieving this
program.
Sequential arrangements of adherent junctions,
desmosomes and tight junctions allow epithelial cells to be
strictly in contact with their immediate environment and
also with their axis of polarity. In contrast, mesenchymal
cells are loosely structured within a three-dimensional
extracellular matrix, which also includes connective
tissues [6]. The changes occuring in stroma, together with
microenvironment transformation, contributes to create a
compartment, where morphological effectors can affect
the integrity and vitality of the tissues.
Recently, several articles have been demonstrated
the EMT involvement in cancer progression and in
metastasis formation, underlining that EMT is a significant
event, responsible for triggering metastatic process [7,8].
In tumors, local cancer environment epithelial cells must
transiently turn into a mesenchymal state for which these
neoplastic epithelial cells take over the evolutionary
conserved EMT process. Moreover, during EMT the
cellular properties (cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity)
of polarized epithelial cells are lost while an invasive,
well-defined mesenchymal phenotype takes place as a
result of multiple important features promoting metastatic
development. Coordinated lost and gain of different
epithelial (β-catenin, E-cadherin) and mesenchymal
(vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle
actin) markers, respectively, enhanced migratory and
invasive abilities, increased apoptosis resistance, and
extended production of extracellular matrix elements
have been shown in human tumor samples and have been
correlated to metastatic progression [9,10].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EMT typically occurs at the tumor-stroma interface,
due to paracrine signaling molecules [11]. Different
pivotal pathways, such as receptor tyrosine kinases,
TGF-β/canonical and non-canonical SMAD signals, are
activated within tumor cells. Importantly, by activating
specific transcription factors (e.g. Snail, Twist and Slug),
they cause the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, a
defining event in EMT [9, 11].
There are considerable data suggesting that EMT
contributes to PCa progression and metastasis. In this
review we summarize and discuss the main molecular
events that directly or indirectly govern the EMT
program in PCa, in order to better define the role and
the mechanisms of this process in PCa progression and
therapeutic resistance.

EMT IN PROSTATE CANCER: ROLE
OF ANDROGENS AND ANDROGENRELATED SIGNALING
Recently, the importance of EMT in tumor biology
has evoked great interest in the scientific audience.
Particularly, it has been reported that EMT play a pivotal
role in promoting tumor metastasis, conferring cancer
stem cell abilities, and mediating drug resistance in several
preclinical model of different cancers [12–15], where the
expression of EMT related molecules has been found to
be well correlated with high grade tumors especially those
that have poor prognosis [16].
Recently, many studies have demonstrated
the presence of EMT-like states in PCa, suggesting
its involvement in prostate cancer development and
metastasis [17, 18]. The main players responsible for
EMT in prostate need to be elucidated, and the effect of
androgen deprivation therapy on EMT is still unclear.
Prostate is an androgen-dependent tissue that
requires androgenic and androgen receptor (AR)
signaling axis for normal functioning [19]. Androgens,
whose action in adult males promotes the cell survival
of secretory epithelial cells (those primarily transformed
in tumor development), exert their functions through
differential steps consisting of testosterone testicular
synthesis, its transport to target tissues, and its reduction to
5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), mediated by 5α-reductase
enzyme. Responsible for the physiological growth and
development of prostate gland, and for the development
and progression of prostate tumors, androgens display
their biological activity by binding and consequently
activating the androgen receptor (AR) [20]. However,
deregulated androgen signaling is one of the most
important factors in PCa progression and its pivotal role in
modulating androgen-mediated EMT induction has been
suggested, even if the mechanistic explanations regarding
how the interplay between AR signaling and EMT-related
transcription factors expression modulates EMT in PCa,
needs to be further investigated.

Androgens are able to affect EMT of PCa epithelial
cells. Here, they suppress the expression of E-cadherin, a
calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule responsible
for the formation of epithelial adherent junctions, and
activate the expression of mesenchymal markers [21].
Interestingly, in PCa epithelial cells, the EMT pattern can
be induced by androgens through the activation of Snail,
leading to a relevant modification in PCa cell migration
and invasion, by possibly eluding TGF-β functional
involvement, and contributing to PCa metastatic behaviour
[22]. Nevertheless, data regarding the androgens function
in the control of EMT are conflicting. Although some
reports have been demonstrated that androgens and AR
play an active role in inducing EMT [22, 23], others have
shown that EMT induction is due to androgen deprivation
[24, 25] or low AR content [26] both in in vivo and in
vitro prostate cancer settings. Moreover, androgen
withdrawal promotes EMT in both normal and tumor
prostate tissues, conferring a mesenchymal phenotype,
despite differences in patient ages and tumor grades [27,
24]. Different in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested
the effect of androgen deprivation on N-cadherin,
E-cadherin, or vimentin expression, as well as a link
between increased N-cadherin, androgen deprivation
and metastasis formation in both human specimens and
LNCaP xenografts [28, 29]. Interestingly, in the LNCaP
cell line the expression of both N-cadherin and ZEB1, a
EMT direct regulator, is enhanced by androgen deprivation
and is associated with chemotherapy resistance [24, 29].
ZEB1, a transcription factor whose expression has been
reported greatly increased after chemical or physical
castration in LuCaP35 normal prostate xenograft model,
human prostate specimens and LNCaP cell line, by
potentially functioning as AR transcriptional suppressor,
intervenes in EMT induced by androgen deprivation
through a bidirectional negative feedback loop with
androgen receptor, revealing a potentially important
consequence of a standard-of-care treatment for PCa [24].
On the contrary, ZEB2 expression seems to be positively
regulated by androgens in LNCaP cells; moreover, in PC3
and DU145 cells the inverse relationship between these
two factors results in a decrease of invasion and migration
properties of AR overexpressing PC3/DU145 cell, induced
by E-cadherin (a ZEB2 transcriptional target) expression
increase [30], leading to the hypothesis that these events
occur as a consequence of ZEB2 reduced levels/activity in
these androgen independent cells. Interestingly, miRNAs
are involved in the post-transcriptional modulation
of ZEB2 expression mediated by AR [31]. miR200 is
responsible for the control of EMT by targeting ZEB
proteins. Higher levels of miR200a/miR200b were found
in LNCaP cells. In addition, in these cells the silencing
of AR determines a reduction of miR200a/miR200b
levels prompting to the hypothesis that androgen receptor
may positively regulates the expression of miR200 [32].
However, a ZEB-miR200s double-negative feedback loop,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

responsible for regulating EMT phenotype stability and
interchangeability, exists [33,34].
In LNCaP cells androgen withdrawal, along with
the activation of PI3K-AKT and ERK pathways, leads to
neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), which is correlated
with PCa progression to a hormone refractory state, and
poor prognosis [35-38]. In prostatic carcinoma, during
neuroendocrine differentiation prostate cancer cells shift
to neuroendocrine-like cells, characterized for expressing
typical neuroendocrine markers (e.g. chromogranin A
and neuron specific enolase) [36]. These neuroendocrine
cells secrete factors that exert mitogenic responses on
adjacent cells and promote androgen independent growth
of PCa cells [38]. In LNCaP cells Snail regulates NED
induced by either androgen deprivation or Snail overexpression. Therefore, by inducing both NED and EMT in
these androgen-dependent cells, Snail can provide a tight
connection between these two main events [39].
AR maintenance is then necessary for EMT
regulation since its loss favors EMT in androgenindependent PCa cells. In addition, in the context of
prostate tumor microenvironment, a role for AR signaling
in prostate fibroblasts in promoting prostate epithelial cell
proliferation [40], as well as in mediating the epitheliumstroma functional interaction, and then favoring the EMT
events leading to metastatic disease, has been proposed
[41]. Thus, the control of AR expression as well as its coeffectors and downstream players may have significant
effect on prostate cancer metastasis [42].

EMT IN PROSTATE CANCER: ROLE OF
ESTROGENS AND ESTROGEN-RELATED
SIGNALING
Interestingly, in the past years, a role for estrogen
signaling in prostate cancer progression has been reported
[43, 44]. Estrogens can directly and indirectly affects the
development and homeostasis of prostate gland; along
with their receptors, they can play a pivotal role in prostate
tumor initiation and progression. Prostatic estrogen
receptor alpha (ER-α) and -β (ER-β), whose expression
patterns progressively differ during PCa progression,
directly mediate the estrogens effect in this disease [45].
After binding with estrogen or estrogen-like compounds,
ER-α and -β can homo- or heterodimerize and in the
nucleus activate different signaling pathways [46]. On
the other hands, the estrogen receptors can also interfere
with androgen synthesis by repressing the hypothalamicpituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and, in turn, the direct effect
on testis [47]. Then, due to the estrogen receptors presence
in prostate, estrogens may directly function on prostate
multiple sites. However, the role of ERs in the neoplastic
events leading to PCa formation and progression still
needs to be elucidated.
In normal prostate, ER-α and -β and their relative
variants have very different expression patterns [48-50].

ER-α is primarily expressed in prostatic stroma where
it displays indirect effects on prostate epithelia [51].
Instead, ER-β expression is found to be high in the gland
epithelium, where ER-β is responsible for regulating its
proliferation and differentiation [51]. In prostate cancer,
methylation of ER-α gene leads to its silencing, loss of
ER-α transcription and ER-α protein [52, 53]. Interestingly,
in several PCa cell lines as well as in hormone refractory
tumors and metastasis, ER-α expression has been observed
suggesting it re-appears as cancer progresses [51, 54].
However, prostate cancer stromal ER-α was reported
to interact with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to
inhibit PCa invasion through the selective up-regulation
of thrombospondin 2 and down-regulation of matrix
metalloproteinase 3 suggesting a protective role of stromal
ER-α in prostate cancer progression [55].
In adult prostate gland ER-β represents the
major estrogen receptor expressed; however, its role
is not yet clearly established. ER-β seemed to act as a
suppressive player of proliferation process, stimulating the
differentiation of adult prostate epithelial cells [56,57]. In
hormone refractory prostate cancers and in high Gleason
grade prostate carcinomas, ER-β expression was found
to be decreased, supporting the contention that loss of
ER-β correlates with disease progression and that could
be considered as a prognostic factor of prostate cancer
[58, 59]. On the other hand, high ER-β protein levels
have reported to be correlated to a worse prognosis
in patients affected by this disease [60]. Interestingly,
ER-β, when activated by 5α-androstane-3β-17β-diol,
maintains the epithelial characteristics and represses the
acquirement of mesenchymal traits and invasive abilities
in prostate cancer cells [61]. Under these conditions, in
aggressive and poorly differentiated high Gleason grade
PCas, ER-β promotes the degradation of HIF-1α (hypoxia
inducible factor 1 alpha subunit), a crucial EMT player,
and downregulates VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
factor), the canonical HIF target. Loss of ER-β therefore
increases VEGF production, which employs neuropilin-1,
a VEGF receptor, in driving EMT by promoting the
nuclear localization of Snail1, through the inactivation of
glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a critical regulator
of Snail1 stability and localization [61]. In addition, due to
deletion of PTEN that represents one of the most frequent
prostate cancer genetic alteration, prostate tumorigenesis
is promoted by BMI-1-mediated repression of ER-β that
enables the HIF-1α/VEGF signaling altered in PCa cells
[62]. Interestingly, ER-β2 and ER-β5 variants, which have
tumor-promoting actions, are able to stabilize HIF-1α and
allow the expression of hypoxic genes in prostate cancer
[63].
The capability of HIF to promote EMT might
account for the common association of increased HIF
levels and intratumoral hypoxia with a poor prognosis
in different cancers, including prostate cancer. By
suppressing ER-β and stimulating HIF-1α-mediated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

VEGF expression, hypoxia can promote the acquisition
of mesenchymal features in PCa cells. Since ER-β is
sensitive to changes in tumor microenvironment, hypoxic
conditions and TGF-β1 signaling can reduce ER-β levels
and alter its action, favoring PCa progression.
Further studies, aimed to disclose all molecular
mechanisms of estrogen signaling during this disease, are
then needed to provide new insights into prostate cancer
biology and novel hormonal therapeutic approaches for
prostate cancer treatment.

ROLE OF TGF-β SIGNALING IN EMT
INDUCTION OF PROSTATE CANCER
CELLS
Among the molecular factors involved in EMT
induction, the TGF-β (transforming growth factor β)
represents one of the main player in inducing this process.
In normal and premalignant cells, TGF-β functions as
an effective tumor suppressor, promoting apoptosis and
cell differentiation [64]. Nevertheless, during tumor
progression, its suppressive properties are lost, and,
consequently, cells display a proliferative phenotype,
initiate immune evasion, growth factors production
and EMT [65]. In tumors, cancer cells bypass TGF-β
suppressive functions, either through directly inactivation
of TGF-β receptors or through repressing specific
downstream elements, which maintain the epithelial
phenotype [66].
Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways
are responsible for TGF-β induced EMT  [66]. Upon
activation by the binding of an active TGF-β ligand,
TGF-β dimers cause the formation of heteromeric complex
between specific TGF-β type II and type I receptors,
which, in their phosphorylated form, propagate the signal
into the cell by phosphorylating Smad2 and Smad3
proteins (its receptor substrates). In the nucleus, the
phosphorylated Smads bind to Smad4 and form a protein
complex which, facilitating its association with DNAbinding cofactors, then activate sequential transcriptional
programs in response to TGF-β [66].  Smad-dependent
pathway promotes TGF-β tumor suppressive roles,
whereas the activation of Smad-independent pathways,
along with the loss of TGF-β tumor suppressor roles,
is responsible for its pro-oncogenic activity [67,68].  In
prostate cancer, increased TGF-β expression is correlated
with progression to advanced disease, with a prognostic
value for survival [69], while loss of TβRI and TβRII is
associated with poor prognosis [70].
Also, TGF-β family proteins communicate through
non-canonical Smad-independent signaling, resulting
in functionally different transcriptional outcomes. RasRaf-Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/MAPK),
Phosphotidylinositol-3kinase-Akt (PI3K/AKT) and JNK/
p38 MAP kinase (JNK/p38MAPK) signaling pathways
are TGF-β downstream effectors, each with distinct
35379

Oncotarget

contributions to EMT [71]. TGF-β stimulation of Erk
through Ras, Raf, and downstream MAPK is necessary in
EMT, as Erk signaling controls genes involved in ECMcell interactions and cellular motility [72]. Furthermore,
the PI3K/AKT pathway represents an important player
of TGF-β-mediated EMT; PI3K blockade leads to EMT
inhibition, whereas forced expression can effectively
disturb cellular junctions [72].
The phenotypic modification necessary for EMT
likely occurs through non-Smad mediated TGF-β
signaling, while TGF-β growth inhibitory functions are
mediated by canonical Smad-dependent signaling [51];
however, a potential signaling synergy between non-Smad
and Smad can occur, in turn inducing cellular plasticity
and impacting EMT [73].
A role for TGF-β-induced EMT has been suggested
in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) where stromal cells are able to induce EMT,
possibly through secreting TGF-β1 and activating its
signaling  [74, 75]. Stromal cells greatly influence the
tumorigenesis in adjacent epithelia. Intraepithelial
neoplasia in prostate cancer, combined with an increase
in the amount of stromal cells, represents the direct
consequence of the loss of  TGF-β  responsiveness
in fibroblasts. Thus,  TGF-β  pathways in fibroblasts
promotes prostate cancer by modulating the  adjacent
epithelial cell growth and its oncogenic ability [76, 77].
In addition, in prostate cancer, TGF-β determines the
nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB),
and for the morphological changes occurring towards a
mesenchymal phenotype [78, 79]. However, EMT like
features have been shown to be blocked by the inhibitor
of NF-κB demonstrating that NF-κB is an important
intermediary of TGF-β mediated EMT in PCa [79].
Current information related to TGF-β induced EMT in
PCa are well documented albeit a conclusive evidence of
EMT from human tissues and the role of TGF-β (stromal
and/or epithelial) in EMT induction in PCa is still missing.
TGF-β is able to regulate AR gene targets in a close
crosstalk with androgens, with AR-dependent outcomes
[80, 41]. The crosstalk between TGF-β signaling and
androgen axis may represent a crucial element for EMT
expression. Changes in cytoskeleton reorganization
induced by androgens may provide active movements that
assist prostate cancer cells migration and metastasis. In
castrate-resistant prostate tumors  a dynamic AR/β-catenin
crosstalk leads to their increased nuclear co-localization
and interaction [81]. The binding of β-catenin to cadherin
represents a requirement for adhesion; however, its
dissociation from the complex formed with cadherin
enables it to reach the nucleus, where β-catenin functions
as a transcription factor, and controls genes responsible
for EMT in prostate cancer. Interestingly, in prostate
cancer epithelium EMT can be induced through a different
mechanism involving β-catenin activation by androgen
signaling [22].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Conserved zinc finger transcription factors,
controlled by upstream TGF-β activities, have been
reported to induce EMT functions [82,83]. Activated
Snail, an EMT key transcription factor whose expression
increases during PCa progression [84], represses
E-cadherin expression, which is one of the hallmarks of
EMT, in several cancer cell types [85-88]. Snail ectopic
expression alone can cause EMT and improve cell motility
in cancer cells [87, 89]. Moreover, its knockdown partially
reverses EMT and enhances cell motility [89, 90].
In  TGF-β-responsive LNCaP-TβRII cells, Snail
expression significantly increases after treatment with
5α-dihydrotestosterone alone or in combination with
TGF-β indicating that androgens, by avoiding the effect
evoked by TGF-β, can independently promote EMT
[22]. In prostate cancer microenvironment Snail is able
to interact not only with TGF-β but also with epidermal
growth factor (EGF) in downregulating the expression
of HLA-I (human leukocyte antigen class I), which
influences prostate cancer progression [91]. Moreover,
in prostate cancer cells Snail knockdown significantly
reverses HLA-I downregulation induced by TGF-β and
EGF, confirming that Snail is crucial for this process [91].
Genetically engineered mouse models provide direct
evidence to support TGF-β role in driving prostate tumor
metastasis. TGF-β signaling in vivo disruption was shown
to accelerate the pathologic malignant prostatic phenotype
of the TRAMP mouse model by altering prostate growth
and inducing EMT [92].
The complex signaling pathways involving
Smad and non-Smad proteins can play a pivotal role
in orchestrating EMT and metastatic responses. The
identification of new important players contributing to
prostate tumor progression as well as additional TGF-β
signaling effectors, useful either prognostically or
diagnostically for characterizing EMT, may allow the
development of new therapeutical tools for this urological
disease.

EGF SIGNALING AND CROSSTALK IN
PROSTATE CANCER
EGF represents a crucial mitogenic factor able to
control physiological prostatic functions [93]. However,
following the binding to EGF receptor (EGFR), it
stimulates cellular growth, vitality, migration and
metastatic abilities of different tumors, including prostate
cancer [94]. EGF and EGFR are aberrantly expressed
in both androgen independent and metastatic PCa,
which possess heightened EMT related features, and
are closely associated with aggressive phenotype, poor
clinical prognosis, high Gleason score, reduced survival
rate [95-97], then contributing to castrate resistant PCa
and progression to metastasis. Interestingly, recent
evidences have demonstrated an important role of EGF/
EGFR signaling in inducing epithelial-mesenchymal
35380

Oncotarget

transition and thereby promoting cell motility in epithelial
cells from several tumor types [98-101]. In carcinomas
EMT marker expression and EGFR over-expression
are almost simultaneous and this event is associated
with enhanced metastasis [102]. In prostate cancer, the
acquired mesenchymal spindle-like cell structure, the
increased expression of fibronectin and N-cadherin, and
the E-cadherin concurrent decrease, represent the specific
traits of EMT induced by EGF [103]. In PC-3 cells EGF
is able to induce EMT by promoting EMT itself and PC-3
cells motility through a protein kinase C (PKC)/GSK3β/Snail signaling pathway. EGF promotes the stability
of upregulated Snail by inducing PKC activation and
consequently preventing GSK-3β phosphorylation activity,
which in turn decreases Snail ubiquitination and increases
its transcription [103]. The PI3K/AKT pathways has been
reported to modulate the activity of GSK-3β. Following its
activation by PI3K phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylates
GSK-3β and inhibits its activity [104]. EGF induced EMT
was found to be mainly dependent on Akt activation, as
inhibition of Akt signaling abolished EGF driven EMT
in PCa cell lines [105, 106]. However, although EGFR
overexpression and EGF signaling constitutive activation
in prostate cancer are associated with poor prognosis, the
exact role played by EGF/EGFR in the progression and
development of this disease still needs to be elucidated.
Recent data underscore the importance of the heat shock
protein 27 (Hsp27) in EGF-mediated EMT in prostate
cancer suggesting that EGF-induced EMT requires Hsp27
and involves β-catenin/Slug signaling pathway [107].
Hsp27 is a molecular chaperone, whose expression is
upregulated following different cellular stresses, which
plays a pivotal role in controlling cellular migration and
invasion [108]. Highly expressed in prostate cancer [109],
Hsp27 is correlated with aggressive cancer behaviour and
metastatic potential [110], and represents a prognostic
marker of poor clinical outcome [111]. Its increased
expression correlates with prostate cancer progression
to castration-resistant disease [112] and it is essential
for EGF-promoted cell migration and invasion, as well
as for EMT markers expression [108], AKT and GSK3β
phosphorylation induced by EGF, and consequently for
β-catenin stabilization [107]. These latter events, in turn,
allow β-catenin nuclear translocation, EMT transcription
factor Slug consequent activation and, finally, prostate
cancer migration and invasion [107]. Hsp27 may act
as an inducer of EMT activated by EGF; in addition, in
prostate cancer it plays a crucial role in controlling both
E-cadherin expression modulation mediated by β-catenin
and EMT transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, in high
grade PCa Hsp27 expression correlates with an increase
in the expression of EMT player Twist [113]. A strong
correlation between both Hsp27 and EGF and advanced
prostate cancer, as well as with EMT through IL-6/STAT3/
Twist pathway, has been reported [113,114]. Furthermore,
EGF favors PCa progression through a ROS/STAT3/HIFwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1α/Twist1/N-cadherin signaling pathway [114]. Twist1 is a
highly conserved, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domaincontaining transcription factor able to induce metastasis
[115], and also EMT. In prostate cancer a key role for
Twist1 during EGF-induced EMT and tumor invasion
has been proposed since it acts as a crucial downstream
mediator of these events. In prostate cancer EGF
stimulates tumor progression via the coordinated ROS
production, the phosphorylation of STAT3 (required for
EGF-induced upregulation of HIF-1α) and the consequent
induction of HIF-1α/Twist1/N-cadherin signaling pathway
[114].
Interestingly, EGF can interact with Src tyrosine
kinase pathway in the induction of EMT in TMPRSS2ERG positive prostate cancers [116]. TMPRSS2-ERG is
a fusion transcript that emerges as prostate cancer cells
specific biomarker; when overexpressed, it plays a pivotal
role in prostate cancer transformation, EMT and invasion
[117-120]. ERG (ETS-related-gene), which represents
the most commonly over-expressed and translocated
oncogene in PCa cells [121], arises from genomic fusion
between androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 gene promoter
upstream sequences and ERG coding sequences [122,
120]. Despite androgen represents the major driver of
TMPRSS2-ERG overexpression in primary tumors,
EGF and Src can modulate the expression of TMPRSS2ERG in PCa cells through a different pathway where
they upregulate ERG expression via miR-30 modulation
[116]. This novel crosstalk between the androgen/AR and
EGF/Src signaling pathways, by connecting EGF and
Src signaling pathways to ERG induction and EMT, via
miR-30b silencing, assumes a relevant role in castrationresistant PCa, where the androgen receptor is abnormally
activated despite androgen absence.

EMT AND CANCER STEM /
PROGENITORS CELLS IN PROSTATE
CANCER
Recently, EMT has been linked to stem cell
phenotype [123] since EMT acquires stem cell-like
features, such as self-renewal and slow proliferation
[124,125]. After androgen-deprivation therapy, both
cancer cells with EMT markers and those with cancer stem
cells (CSCs) markers increase in human prostate cancer
specimens [126,127]. Stem-like stem/progenitors cells
acquire more complete EMT molecular characteristics
and exhibit more aggressive abilities. Specifically, prostate
CSCs display increased EMT markers as well as increased
tumorigenesis, migration and invasion ability [128]. The
molecular mechanism underlying EMT and regulation
of stemness is still not clear. Cell signaling pathways

[129, 130]. EMT activator Twist1 can promote both
stemness and EMT properties [131, 132], providing a
connection between CSCs and EMT. Moreover, in PCa the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling activation induces EMT and
enhances CSCs phenotype, responsible for the associated
radioresistance of this disease [133]. Interestingly, AR,
whose expression is low in prostate cancer stem cell/
progenitors cells, plays a negative role in EMT of these
cells, by controlling AKT pathway [134].
PCa cancer stem/progenitor cells and metastasis
are inhibited by miR-34a through the direct repression
of CD44, a major adhesion molecule of the extracellular
matrix, which is also a marker of CSCs [135]. CD44 plays
an important role in inducing EMT and/or in maintaining
the mesenchymal phenotype in PCa [136,137]. As
a marker of cancer stem/progenitor cells, CD44, by
promoting EMT and metastasis in PCa carcinogenesis,
may serve a new potential prostate cancer therapeutic
approach. Furthermore, CD44 high expression level
was associated with biochemical recurrence and distant
metastasis, making CD44 a marker of poor prognosis in
prostate cancer [136]. In addition, CD44+ stem-like cell

population increases in prostate cancer cells following
ADT–induced TGF-β signaling activation leading to dedifferentiated phenotype of prostate cancer cells [137].
CD44+ cancer stem/progenitor cells, in response to TGF-β
signaling, not only can initiate the EMT but also can
regulate the mesenchymal phenotype in prostate cancer
cells.
However, additional signaling pathways are
responsible for regulation of stemness and EMT of PCa
cells. Overexpressed N-cadherin, a marker of ongoing
EMT, achieves EMT, stemness promoting function and
metastatic ability by activating the ErbB signaling in PCa
cells, further supporting the hypothesis that N-cadherin
could be a promising target in PCa therapy [138].
Abnormal expression of N-cadherin has been shown
as crucial not only to metastasis, but also to castration
resistance [28, 29], and associated with poor prognosis
[138,139]. Simultaneous upregulation of N-cadherin and
downregulation of E-cadherin have been found in more
aggressive cultured PCa cell lines and in primary and
metastatic prostate tumors [140-142]. Mice xenograft
models treated with N-cadherin monoclonal antibody have

displayed an inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis
[28]. Recent study showed that miR-145 played a pivotal
role in inhibiting migration, invasion, stemness, and EMT
properties of prostate cancer cells via different targets
[143, 144]. In gastric cancer N-cadherin is miR-145
direct target and promotes the invasion and metastasis
cascade [145]. However, since N-cadherin promotes
prostate cancer cells stemness features and EMT, a role
for N-cadherin in mediating miR-145 function in the
regulation of these events has been proposed [146].
It is well established that Wnt pathway has a
developmental role in tissues and organisms. However,
the aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
correlates with EMT features and also positively affects
proliferation and invasiveness in PCa [147]. Interestingly,
miR-320, a CD44+ prostate CSCs negative regulator,
can inhibit the expression of β-catenin and repress CSCs
via Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibition [148]. In addition,
some CSCs features (e.g. tumor-spheres formation,
tumorigenicity, chemioresistance) are enhanced by
downregulation of miR-320 [148].
In NOD/SCID IL2RY null mice Erismodegib (an
inhibitor of Sonic hedgehog pathway) can inhibit the
growth of human prostate CSCs and EMT by upregulating
miR-200 and consequently inhibiting Snail, Slug and
Zeb1 transcription factors, and preventing Bmi-1, which
contributes to the self-renewal capacity of prostate CSCs,
through miR-128 induction, respectively [149].
Then, many miRNAs, by regulating EMT, cancer
cell migration and invasion, and CSCs properties may
represent the common step combining EMT, CSCs, and
drug resistance.

On the other hands, different miRNAs, capable of
inhibiting cancer progression, are down-expressed in
androgen independent prostate tumors, resulting in high
and low levels of mesenchymal and epithelial markers,
respectively, that can induce EMT, increase prostate cancer
aggressiveness and resistance to androgen deprivation
therapy [155].
Due to their advantageous in vivo stabilities and
pharmacokinetics characteristics, small molecule drugs
have emerged as favorable tool in the regulation of
miRNAs and in potentially suppressing drug resistance
in PCa [156, 157]. Since the modification of abnormal
miRNAs levels can make resistant PCa cells more
sensitive to small molecule drugs, the combined use of
these innovative agents (such as small molecules and
miRNAs) may represent a favorable approach for the
therapeutic treatment of resistant prostate cancers.
Current studies regarding prostate tumor
microenvironment have highlight that signals arising
from microenvironment can play a key role in governing
EMT and highly influence cancer progression or clinical
outcomes in PCa patients. Several key regulators and
inducers, supported by their crosstalking signaling
pathways and ligands, are then responsible for the
transition to a dedifferentiated invasive phenotype (Figure
1). The detailed characterization of the crosstalks between
EMT and castration resistance may offer the potential to
identify novel prognostic or diagnostic markers as well as
to develop new tailored therapeutic approaches for PCa
management.

GRANT SUPPORT

The reappearance of the tumor acquired drug
resistance along with some features of EMT and stemness
have been responsible for the failure of traditional
chemotherapy and/or androgen ablation treatment for the
therapy of advanced/metastatic PCa. Thus, to prevent the
metastatic spread, novel strategies are being used, which
inhibit cancer cell proliferation, EMT and stem cell-like
properties.
Altered miRNAs are correlated to prostate cancer
initiation, progression and metastasis [150], and their
aberrant expression can allow the progression to resistant
prostate tumors [151]. In androgen independent prostate
cancers miR-221/-222 and miR-125b are frequently
upregulated promoting prostate cancers cells resistance
to androgen withdrawal and androgen-independent cell
growth [152, 153]. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs
are correlated with PCa development and its progression
to androgen-independent disease. Elevated expression
of miR-141, miR-375 and miR-378 have been found
in the serum of prostate cancers patients suggesting
their potential use as PCa diagnostic biomarkers [154].
