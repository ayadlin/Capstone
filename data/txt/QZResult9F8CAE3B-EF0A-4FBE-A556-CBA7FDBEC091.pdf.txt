Abstract
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone
that contributes to the proper folding and stability of target
proteins. Because HSP90 has been suggested to interact with
FLIPS, the key regulator of tumor necrosis factor-A–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis in
glioma cells, we examined the role HSP90 played in controlling TRAIL response. HSP90A was found to associate with
FLIPS in resting cells in a manner dependent on the ATPbinding NH2-terminal domain of HSP90A. Following TRAIL
exposure, HSP90A and the client FLIPS protein were recruited
to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Short
interfering RNA–mediated suppression of HSP90A did not
alter the total cellular levels of FLIPS, but rather inhibited the
recruitment of FLIPS and other antiapoptotic proteins such as
RIP and FLIPL to the DISC, and sensitized otherwise resistant
glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results show
that HSP90A, by localizing FLIPS to the DISC, plays a key role
in the resistance of tumor cells to TRAIL, and perhaps other
proapoptotic agents. The results also define a novel means of
apoptotic control by a HSP90A that may in turn help explain
the global antiapoptotic effects of this protein. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Heat shock proteins (HSP) are a highly conserved group of
intracellular proteins classified by molecular weight into groups of
HSP110, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, small molecular HSPs (<27 kDa),
and ubiquitin (1–5). HSPs, as a group, are among the most
abundant proteins in the cytosol and function in multicomponent
complexes as molecular chaperones. HSP function is best understood under conditions of cellular stress (hypoxia, heat), during
which levels of HSPs are dramatically increased (3, 6). Under these
conditions, HSPs promote cell survival by preventing protein
aggregation and promoting the refolding of damaged proteins
(1–3, 7, 8).
In addition to having a key role in mitigating cellular stress, HSPs
also play a critical role in unstressed cells. HSP70, and to a lesser
extent HSP90, are critically involved in what are called ‘‘protein
holding’’ functions (8–10). HSP70 binds to newly synthesized
peptides and prevents premature protein misfolding, whereas
HSP90 binds to proteins with unstable tertiary structures and helps

to prevent protein degradation. HSP60 and HSP27, in contrast,
are considered to function in protein folding (8–10). These HSPs
form folding complexes that use ATP to help create the intramolecular interactions necessary for client protein folding (3, 11).
The protein holding and folding functions of HSPs are critical in all
normal cells, consistent with the embryonic lethal nature of HSP
deletion (12).
The protein holding and protein folding functions of the HSPs are
critical not only in normal unstressed cells, but also in transformed
cells, in which the normal functions of HSPs are used to facilitate
cell growth and cell cycle progression. As an example, HSP90
stabilizes Akt and oncogenic forms of mutant epidermal growth
factor receptor, both of which contribute to the growth of a
variety of cancers including gliomas (13–15). HSP70, in a complex
with HSP90 and HSP40, also serves to regulate the function
and turnover of the estrogen receptor, increasing its activation and
driving estrogen-dependent cellular responses (16, 17). HSP70 and
HSP90 are also critically involved in the DNA-binding properties
and stability of p53, and by stabilizing mutant p53, contribute to its
role in transformation (18, 19). These observations suggest that the
normal protein folding functions of HSPs, and in particular HSP70
and HSP90, are subverted by tumors to stabilize proteins critical for
the establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype.
Although HSPs play a key role in the regulation of cell growth
and cell cycle progression, their antiapoptotic properties may
be even more important to the persistence of malignant cells.
The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is driven by mitochondrial
release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, which in turn triggers
the polymerization of Apaf-1. Apaf-1 recruits procaspase-9 and
procaspase-3 into the apoptosome, where the caspases are
activated (20, 21). HSP70 reportedly interacts with Apaf-1, thereby
preventing the interaction of Apaf-1 with procaspase-9 (22–24).
Overexpression of HSP27 also increases the resistance of cells to
various apoptotic stimuli reportedly by directly binding to the
cytosolic cytochrome c and sequestering it from Apaf-1 (25, 26).
In addition, HSP20 has been reported to complex with the
proapoptotic protein Bax, which prevents the translocation of
Bax from the cytosol into the mitochondria during apoptotic insult
(27). As a result, HSP20 may preserve the integrity of mitochondria,
restrict the release of cytochrome c, and repress the activation
of caspase-3. The antiapoptotic effects of HSPs seem to be of
particular importance in the cancer setting because targeted
disruption of HSP27 or HSP70 leads to the activation of
programmed cell death pathways (28). These results suggest that
the ability of HSPs to block programmed cell death may help
sustain the transformed cells and perhaps also to contribute to
resistance to proapoptotic therapeutic agents.
Although HSP20, HSP27, and HSP70 are recognized as controllers of programmed cell death, the role of HSP90 in this process

is less clear. There are two forms of HSP90 in the cytosol, HSP90a
and HSP90h, which when combined, comprise f1% to 2% of
total cellular proteins (29, 30). Although these highly related
isoforms differ in their inducibility (HSP90a is inducible, HSP90h
is constitutively expressed), the functional differences between the
two proteins are not well defined. Both contain a highly
conserved ATP-binding domain near their NH2 terminus, and
the chaperoning activity of both requires the binding of ATP at
this site (31, 32). The middle region of both HSP90a and HSP90h
has a key role in the binding of client proteins (33), whereas the
COOH terminus domain facilitates the dimerization of HSP90
(34, 35). The COOH terminus domain of HSP90a also contains a
conserved EEVD motif that recruits various co-chaperones, such
as the immunophilins and HSP70/HSP90-organizing protein,
which in turn, modify the specificity of the HSP90-containing
complexes (34, 35). HSP90 has been reported to play a role in
apoptosis induced by nicotinamide, and HSP90 also binds to a
variety of clients, many of which play key roles in the control of
apoptosis (14, 36–38). In particular, HSP90 has been reported to
bind to FLIP, a protein that interacts with FADD and is a key
suppressor of tumor necrosis factor-a–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis in gliomas (37, 39). Although
the exact isoforms of HSP90 and FLIP involved in this interaction
have not been defined, our interest in TRAIL as a targeted
chemotherapeutic agent, and in understanding the pathways that
control TRAIL sensitivity/resistance in gliomas, led us to examine
the possibility that HSP90a, via its potential ability to bind to and
stabilize FLIPS, might also be a key regulator of TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. We here show that HSP90a does regulate TRAILinduced apoptosis, but not by altering FLIPS stability. Rather,
HSP90a interacts with FLIPS and inhibits its ability to localize
to its site of action in the death-inducing signal complex. Furthermore, the ability of HSP90a to localize antiapoptotic proteins to
the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is not limited to FLIPS,
but also applies to at least two other antiapoptotic proteins, RIP
and FLIPL. These results identify a novel means of apoptotic control
by a HSP, and also identify a novel mechanism by which HSP90a
can control sensitivity to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including
TRAIL.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatment. Immortalized or Ras-transformed
human astrocytes were generated and cultured as described previously (40).
Human recombinant TRAIL was kindly provided by Avi Ashkenazi
(Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Cells were exposed to TRAIL
(800 ng/mL) for 24 h prior to harvest.
Retroviral infection, transfection of plasmids, and short interfering
RNA. The pBabe retroviral construct encoding constitutively active cdc42
(Q61L) was provided by David Stokoe (UCSF Cancer Center, San Francisco,
CA). Pools of productively infected cells (9 Ag/mL, obtained by selection
with puromycin; Sigma) were used for further analysis. The pFLAG-CMV 6c
mammalian expression vector encoding wild-type human HSP90a was
kindly provided by Dario C. Altieri (University of Massachusetts Medical
School, Worcester, MA). The pGEX vectors encoding various glutathione
S-transferase–tagged NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal deletion mutants of
the chicken HSP90a protein were kindly provided by Ahmed Chadli (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN). The pGEX vectors containing chicken HSP90a
cDNA were digested with EcoRI and SalI, after which the cDNA was
subcloned into EcoRI + SalI–digested mammalian expression vector
pFLAG-CMV 6c (Sigma). Cells were then transiently transfected using
Fugene 6 (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, after
which the cells were harvested 48 h later. For short interfering RNA (siRNA)

studies, 300 nmol/L of either HSP90a-targeted siRNA (Ambion) or
scramble siRNA was transfected into cells using Fugene 6 (Roche)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and protein levels were
analyzed 24 to 72 h later by Western blot. In TRAIL plus siRNA studies
(except where noted), siRNA was added to the cells for 48 h followed by
incubation with TRAIL in the presence of siRNA for an additional 24 h prior
to cell harvest.
Immunoprecipitation and analysis of DISC components. For the
analysis of components of the assembled DISC, cells were incubated with
TRAIL (0 or 800 ng/mL, 24 h) and lysed, after which, the DISC-related
proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FADD antibody. For
immunoprecipitation of HSP90a, FLIPS, FLIPL, and RIP, cells were allowed
to reach 70% confluency in DMEM. Following incubation with TRAIL (0 or
800 ng/mL) for 24 h, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and
harvested using 1 ice-cold cell lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mmol/L of
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 10 min. HSP90a,
FLIPS, FLIPL, or RIP was selectively immunoprecipitated from 200 Ag of
protein (whole cell lysates) by combining the cell lysate with 20 AL of FADD
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) conjugated to agarose A/G beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by gentle rotation for 4 h at 4jC. In
some instances, an HSP90a antibody was used to immunoprecipitate
FLIPS, FLIPL, or RIP following incubation with TRAIL. In order to immunoprecipitate the various FLAG-tagged NH2- or COOH-terminal HSP90a
deletion mutants, the cell lysate of NH2- or COOH-terminal HSP90a
deletion mutant–expressing cells was combined with an antibody targeting
the FLAG epitope (Cell Signaling Technology). Samples were then centrifuged briefly (30 s, 2,000  g ) and pellets were washed twice with 1 lysis
buffer. Immunocomplexes (pellets) were eluted in 3 SDS sample buffer.
The levels of HSP90a, FLIPS, FLIPL, and RIP in the assembled DISC, as
well as expression of the FLAG-tagged HSP90a NH2- or COOH-terminal
deletion mutants, were assessed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitations carried out using a nonspecific normal mouse IgG antibody were
included as negative controls, as were the analyses of cells to which TRAIL
(800 ng/mL) was added following lysis.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped
from the culture dish, and incubated in tissue lysis buffer containing
10 mmol/L of KCl, 1 mmol/L of sucrose, 2 mmol/L of MgCl2, 0.5%
Igepal CA-630, 1 mmol/L of EDTA, 1 mmol/L of DTT, 10 mmol/L of
h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L of Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L of NaF, 100 Ag/mL of
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 Ag/mL of aprotinin (all reagents were
purchased from Sigma) for 30 min on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged,
and the supernatant was stored at 80jC until use. The protein
concentration of extracts was measured using Protein Assay reagent (BioRad Laboratories). Protein (30 Ag) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and
electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane
was blocked in 5% nonfat skim milk/TBST [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20] at 4jC overnight and incubated with
rabbit polyclonal antibody against HSP90a, FLAG, phospho-Akt, FLIPS,
FADD, FLIPL, TANK, RIP, TRAF, or a-tubulin (all antibodies obtained from
Cell Signaling Technologies). Bound antibody was detected with antirabbit
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using enhanced chemiluminescence
Western blotting detection regents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.).
Densitometric measurements of immunoreactive bands were acquired
using an AlphaImager 2200 (Alpha Innotech Corporation). The expression
of a-tubulin was used to verify equal loading.
Analysis of apoptosis by flow cytometry. For the analysis of apoptosis,
cells were incubated with either TRAIL (800 ng/mL) or vehicle control, after
which, cells were harvested and monitored for the percentage of cells with
sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cells) using propidium iodide as previously
described (41).
For cell cycle analysis, harvested cells were centrifuged and resuspended
in PBS after which, the cells were fixed by the addition of ice-cold 70%
ethanol and stored at 20jC for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were pelleted by
centrifugation and resuspended in staining solution containing 1 mg/mL of
propidium iodide (Sigma) and 50 mg/mL of RNase A (Sigma) in PBS. After
5 min of incubation at 37jC, the cell suspension was passed through a
40-Am pore size cell strainer (Becton Dickinson) and subjected to flow

Figure 1. Effects of siRNA targeting
HSP90a on HSP90a, HSP90h,
phospho-Akt, and FLIPS protein levels.
Normal human astrocytes were serially
infected with retroviruses encoding E6, E7,
hTERT, and either a constitutively active
form of mutant V12 H-Ras (E6/E7/hTERT/

additionally modified to selectively
activate the Ral (G37), Raf (S35), or

Cells were then mock transfected (CTRL ),

targeting HSP90a or a nonspecific
scrambled siRNA, and analyzed for levels
of HSP90a (A), HSP90h (B), phospho-Akt

siRNA addition. a-Tubulin was used as
a loading control. FLIPS exposures in (A)
are longer than those in (B ) because of
relatively low levels of FLIPS expression in

analyzed using CellQuest and ModFit software (Becton Dickinson). For the
purpose of analysis, acquired events (20,000 cells) were gated to eliminate
cell aggregates and debris.

Results
Because the protein stabilizing property of HSP90a has been
linked to the suppression of apoptosis, we addressed the possible
involvement of HSP90a in the control of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
We focused these studies on HSP90a because only HSP90a, and
not HSP90h, was up-regulated in glioma cells.4 To begin these
studies, normal human astrocytes immortalized and/or transformed by the expression of one of four different forms of V12
H-Ras (E6/E7/hTERT/Ras cells expressing V12 H-Ras, G37 cells
expressing V12 H-Ras E37G, S35 cells expressing V12 H-Ras T35S,
or C40 cells expressing V12 H-Ras Y40C) were obtained. These cells,
which exhibit different levels of FLIPS expression and TRAIL
sensitivity (E6/E7/hTERT/Ras and G37 have low levels of FLIPS
and >10-fold higher TRAIL sensitivity, S35 and C40 have 3-fold
higher levels of FLIPS and low TRAIL sensitivity; ref. 42) were first
incubated with siRNA targeting HSP90a. Levels of HSP90a,
HSP90h, and of two reported client proteins of HSP90a, pAkt
(13, 37) and FLIPS (a key inhibitor of TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in glioma cells; refs. 39, 43) were then monitored by Western
blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, incubation of cells with siRNA
targeting HSP90a significantly decreased protein levels of HSP90a
(relative to cells receiving a scrambled siRNA control) for up to
72 h following siRNA introduction without altering the levels of
HSP90h. Consistent with previous reports, suppression of HSP90a

also resulted in a concomitant decrease in the protein levels of
pAkt (Fig. 1C; refs. 14, 37). siRNA-mediated suppression of HSP90a,
did not, however, alter the protein levels of FLIPS (Fig. 1D), which
was surprising given that FLIPS has been reported to be both a
client protein of HSP90a (43) and down-regulated in response to
suppression of the pAkt-mTOR pathway (39).
Having shown that siRNA targeting HSP90a could down-regulate
HSP90a levels, the effects of HSP90a down-regulation on TRAIL
sensitivity were examined. TRAIL-sensitive cells (E6/E7/HTERT/
Ras and G37 cells) underwent significant apoptosis in response to
TRAIL (800 ng/mL, 24 h; Fig. 2A, top, lanes 1 and 2), consistent with
our previous observations that TRAIL induces a dose-dependent
cleavage (activation) of caspases across a 0 to 1000 ng/mL range of
exposure, with peak activation 24 h after exposure (42; data not
shown). The levels of HSP90a and FLIPS in these cells were not
altered by TRAIL exposure [Fig. 2A, bottom, lanes 1 and 2, FLIPS in
(A) overexposed relative to the FLIPS in (B)]. Incubation of
these cells with siRNA targeting HSP90a reduced levels of HSP90a
(but not FLIPS) relative to cells receiving scrambled siRNA control
(Fig. 2A, bottom, lanes 3 and 4), but did not significantly alter the
high levels of TRAIL-induced apoptosis noted in these relatively
FLIPS-deficient cells (Fig. 2A, top, columns 3 and 4). In TRAILresistant S35 and C40 cells (Fig. 2B, top, lanes 1 and 2) incubation
with siRNA targeting HSP90a also reduced the levels of HSP90a
(but not FLIPS) relative to cells receiving scrambled siRNA control
(Fig. 2A, bottom, lanes 3 and 4), although in these TRAIL-resistant/
FLIPS overexpressing cells, suppression of HSP90a levels significantly increased the extent of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B,
top, columns 3 and 4). These results show that HSP90a levels could
control the extent of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but that they do so
in a manner apparently independent of FLIPS levels.
Because suppressing levels of the chaperone protein HSP90a
increased TRAIL sensitivity, but only in cells with higher levels of

HSP90a Regulates FLIPS Localization and TRAIL Sensitivity

FLIPS, we considered the possibility that HSP90a might control
TRAIL sensitivity not by altering FLIPS levels, but rather by
altering FLIPS localization. To begin to address this possibility,
TRAIL-sensitive cells (E6/E7/hTERT/Ras, G37) with high levels of
HSP90a and low levels of FLIPS were first retrovirally infected with
a construct encoding cdc42 (a protein shown to translationally
up-regulate FLIPS expression; ref. 42), after which levels of FLIPS,
HSP90a, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis were examined in TRAILtreated cells. Introduction of the cdc42-encoding construct had no
effect on the levels of HSP90a protein, but did increase the levels of
FLIPS protein relative to cells receiving empty vector (Fig. 3, bottom,
lanes 3 and 4), and to cells receiving the cdc42-encoding construct
but not exposed to TRAIL (42). Consistent with previous reports
(42, 44), the cdc42-mediated increase in FLIPS protein levels
decreased TRAIL sensitivity relative to cells that received only
empty vector (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). The cdc42-overexpressing,
FLIPS up-regulated E6/E7/hTERT/Ras and G37 cells were then
incubated with an siRNA targeting HSP90a, after which levels of
HSP90a and FLIPS, and the extent of TRAIL-induced apoptosis
were assessed. Incubation of cdc42-overexpresing cells with siRNA
targeting HSP90a effectively reduced the levels of HSP90a protein
whereas having no effect on the levels of FLIPS protein relative to
cells receiving scramble siRNA control (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6);
however, as in cells with endogenously high levels of FLIPS (S35,
C40; Fig. 2), siRNA targeting HSP90a sensitized the FLIPS
overexpressing E6/E7/hTERT/Ras and G37 cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis relative to cells that received a scrambled siRNA control
(Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6).
Having shown that siRNA-mediated suppression of HSP90a
confers TRAIL sensitivity in cells endogenously or exogenously
overexpressing FLIPS, and that TRAIL-induced apoptosis was
not associated with changes in absolute FLIPS levels, we directly
examined the possibility that HSP90a enhances TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by chaperoning FLIPS to its site of action in the DISC.
To do so, lysates from TRAIL-incubated E6/E7/hTERT/Ras and
G37 cells (low levels of FLIPS) or cdc42 overexpressing E6/E7/
hTERT/Ras or G37 cells (high levels of FLIPS) were subjected to
immunoprecipitation using an antibody targeting the DISC-related
proteins FADD, after which protein levels of HSP90a and FLIPS in

the immunoprecipitated DISC were monitored by Western blotting.
Incubation with TRAIL resulted in the appearance of HSP90a in the
FADD-immunoprecipitated DISC of TRAIL-sensitive E6/E7/hTERT/
Ras and G37 cells (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3), and also in
the same cells made TRAIL-resistant by virtue of cdc42-driven FLIPS
overexpression relative to control cells (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus lanes 4
and 5), or to cdc42-overexpressing cells not incubated with TRAIL
(data not shown). Incubation with an siRNA targeting HSP90a,
however, abolished the recruitment of both HSP90a and FLIPS to
the DISC (relative to scramble controls; Fig. 3B, lane 5 versus lane 6).
These results show that HSP90a serves to localize FLIPS to the
DISC, and in doing so, allows FLIPS to interfere with the activation
of the TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling pathway.
The ability of HSP90a to localize FLIPS to the DISC following
TRAIL exposure, as well as the suggestion that FLIPS is a client
protein of HSP90a, suggests a physical interaction between the two
proteins. To directly determine if, and under what circumstances,
FLIPS and HSP90a interact, and which domains of the HSP90a
protein were necessary for FLIPS binding and localization, cells with
high levels of FLIPS (C40 and S35) were first transiently transfected
with various constructs encoding avian FLAG-tagged deletion
mutants of HSP90a (the avian HSP90a is 94% homologous to the
human protein; ref. 2, forms a functional complex with HSP90a
co-chaperones; ref. 34, and is widely used to study HSP90a-client
protein interactions). Expression of the control FLAG-tagged NH2terminal domain mutants, and the FLAG-tagged COOH-terminal
domain deletion mutants were then verified by Western blot using
an antibody to FLAG (Fig. 4A, S35; data not shown). Having
established the expression of the FLAG-tagged HSP90a deletion
mutants, the transfected C40 and S35 cells were lysed after which
the lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody
targeting FLAG. The levels of FLIPS protein were then assessed by
Western blot following elution of the immunoprecipitated proteins
and compared with total levels of FLIPS protein in the lysate prior to
immunoprecipitation. Although total levels of FLIPS were similar in
all groups (Fig. 4B), both FLAG-tagged NH2-terminal deletion
mutants of HSP90a were less efficient at binding to FLIPS (lanes 4
and 6). Deletion of the COOH-terminal domain of the HSP90a
protein, however, had no effect on the ability of HSP90a to bind to

which, levels of HSP90a and FLIPS were
monitored by Western blot (bottom ). a-Tubulin
was used as a loading control. Both 1 (30 s)
and 5 FLIPS exposures are provided for the

FLIPS (lanes 3, 5, and 7), and these deletion mutant HSP90a
proteins bound FLIPS as well as the full-length HSP90a protein
(lane 2). These results show that whereas the COOH-terminal
domain of HSP90a is not necessary for interaction with FLIPS, the
NH2-terminal domain, and specifically, the NH2-terminal 206 amino
acid (which contains the ATP-binding domain) are necessary and
sufficient to bind to FLIPS.
Having shown that HSP90a regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis
by chaperoning FLIPS to its site of action in the DISC, we considered the possibility that HSP90a may serve as a chaperone for
multiple DISC-related proteins, and in doing so, serve as a more
global regulator of apoptosis. To address this possibility, TRAILresistant C40 cells were incubated with a scrambled siRNA or an
siRNA targeting HSP90a, after which the cells were exposed to

TRAIL. The levels of a variety of DISC-related proteins were then
assessed in cell lysates and in DISC complexes immunoprecipitated
using a FADD-directed antibody. siRNA-mediated suppression of
HSP90a levels did not alter the total cellular levels of any of the
DISC-related proteins relative to controls (TRAIL alone, scrambled
siRNA plus TRAIL, and lysates exposed to TRAIL; Western blot;
Fig. 5). It did, as expected, significantly decrease levels of FLIPS in
the immunoprecipitated DISC (Fig. 5, lanes 5 versus 4). siRNAmediated suppression of HSP90a levels, however, also significantly
decreased the levels of FLIPL and RIP in the DISC, whereas not
altering levels of FADD, TANK, or TRAF. These results show that
HSP90a serves as a selective chaperone for a subfamily of DISCrelated proteins, and that this action, rather than protein
stabilization or alteration of protein levels, could allow HSP90a
to globally regulate apoptosis initiated by a variety of stimuli.
Having established that HSP90a interacts with the FLIPS protein,
we considered the possibility that HSP90a may interact with a
complex of DISC-related proteins, maintaining the stability of these
client proteins prior to recruitment to the DISC, as previously
suggested by Lewis et al. (45). To do so, C40 cells with high levels of
FLIPS and HSP90a were lysed, after which, the proteins in the
lysate were immunoprecipitated using an antibody targeting
HSP90a. Following elution of the immunoprecipitated proteins,
levels of HSP90a, FLIPS, FLIPL, RIP, FADD, TANK, and TRAF
proteins were then monitored by Western blot and compared with
total levels of these proteins from an aliquot of lysate obtained
prior to immunoprecipitation. Although the C40 cells expressed
high levels of all DISC-related proteins as assessed by Western blot
prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6B), only HSP90a, FLIPS, FLIPL,
and RIP were present in the immunoprecipitated HSP90a protein
complex (relative to proteins immunoprecipitated with an IgG
antibody; Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained
using S35 cells (data not shown). These studies show that HSP90a,
in a manner that is ATP-binding domain-dependent, interacts with
a complex of DISC-related proteins consisting of FLIPS, FLIPL, and
RIP in resting cells and allows the recruitment of these proteins to
the DISC following apoptotic stimulation.

Discussion
The ability of HSP90a to bind and stabilize potentially oncogenic
proteins has long been recognized as critical to the tumorigenic
process. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that HSP90a also
contributes to tumorigenesis in other ways. The present study
provides evidence that in addition to binding and stabilizing
potentially oncogenic proteins, HSP90a helps localize FLIPS and
a subset of other antiapoptotic proteins to their site of action in
the DISC. The immediate consequence of this action is that HSP90a
regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis and has the potential to contribute
to TRAIL resistance. In a broader sense, however, the novel localization
function of HSP90a may help explain the global antiapoptotic
functions of HSP90a and its overexpression in a variety of cancers.
Although our observation that HSP90a down-regulation decreased pAkt levels was expected, the inability of HSP90a downregulation to alter FLIPS levels was initially surprising. Interaction
of client proteins with HSPs typically results in increased client
protein stability and increased client protein levels. In the present
study, however, FLIPS levels were not altered by HSP90a
suppression or pAkt suppression. This was particularly surprising
because decreased levels of pAkt (as seen following exposure to
HSP90a siRNA) have been reported to decrease translation of FLIPS

HSP90a Regulates FLIPS Localization and TRAIL Sensitivity

Figure 4. The NH2-terminal ATP-binding
domain of HSP90a is both necessary and
sufficient to bind to FLIPS. TRAIL-resistant C40
and S35 cells were transiently transfected
with an empty vector (pFLAG-CMV 6c), or a
vector encoding various NH2-terminal or
COOH-terminal deletion mutants of HSP90a.
A, expression of the deletion mutants was
verified by Western blot analysis using an
anti-FLAG antibody 48 h following transfection
(S35 cells not shown). B, the interaction
between the HSP90a deletion mutants and
FLIPS in C40 and S35 cells was assessed in
protein eluted from anti-FLAG antibody
immunoprecipitates using an antibody targeting
FLIPS. To verify equal levels of FLIPS protein
among the experimental groups, total levels of
FLIPS protein in the lysates of the deletion
mutant–expressing cells were determined by
Western blot using an aliquot of lysate taken
prior to immunoprecipitation. The data are
representative of one of three independent
experiments for each group.

mRNA and lower FLIPS protein levels (39). Although HSP90a has
the potential to regulate the Akt-mTOR-FLIPS pathway at multiple
levels, the end result of suppression of HSP90a was clearly not
decreased levels of FLIPS. FLIPS, however, as previously reported
(39, 42, 46), did play a key role in controlling TRAIL sensitivity as
cdc42 overexpression (which drives FLIPS overexpression independently of Akt levels; refs. 42, 44) increased both FLIPS levels and
TRAIL resistance (Fig. 3). These results, as a whole, suggest that the
although in some cases HSP90a serves to control the protein levels
of client proteins, in other cases, it alters client protein function in
more subtle ways.
The ability of HSP90a to interact with FLIPS, and guide it to the
DISC, is both consistent with known HSP function and novel. HSPs
typically interact with client proteins in a manner dependent on
the NH2-terminal ATP-binding domain of the HSP. The interaction
between HSP90a and FLIPS seems to follow this paradigm as the
ATP-binding NH2-terminal domain was required for the HSP90aFLIPS interaction. Although the interaction between HSPs and
client proteins follows a standard route, the end result of HSP/
client protein interactions can be variable. In some cases, the
interaction could lead to stabilization and protection from
degradation, whereas in other instances, intracellular targeting of
the proteins occurs. As an example, HSP90 has been reported to
stabilize RIP (ref. 45; although our studies with siRNA-targeting of
HSP90a suggests that this action is dependent on geldanamycininhibitable forms of HSP90, but not HSP90a). HSP90a has also
been reported to protect the mutant form of p53 from degradation
in some tumors (18, 19), or localize the active form of the estrogen
receptor from the cytosol to the nucleus where it interacts with the
estrogen response element (47). In some instances, HSP90a seems
to be involved in both stabilizing and localizing client proteins.
As an example, Her-2 (p185erbB2), a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a significant proportion of malignancies, binds to
HSP90a and the HSP90a endoplasmic reticulum homologue, Grp94
(48). Treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor leads to the disruption of
these complexes, resulting in both protein instability as well as
the inability of the nascent Her-2 peptide to localize to the
endoplasmic reticulum (48). The present study represents the first
example of an HSP-client interaction leading to localization of an
antiapoptotic protein to its site of action in the DISC. Given the
importance of HSP90a in the interaction, and that the FLIPS/
HSP90a complex is recruited to the DISC only following pro-

apoptotic stimuli, the results suggest that DISC assembly creates
or reveals a binding site for the HSP90a-FLIPS complex through
direct interaction with HSP90a. HSP90a displays a binding
preference for the aC-h4 loop region found in a variety of client
proteins (49). One possibility, therefore, is that this HSP90a-binding
motif is revealed following DISC assembly in response to apoptotic

Figure 5. HSP90a serves as a chaperone for multiple DISC-related proteins.
TRAIL-resistant C40 cells were either exposed to vehicle or TRAIL (800 ng/mL,
24 h), or were transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting HSP90a,
after which the transfected cells were exposed to TRAIL (800 ng/mL) during
the last 24 h of the 72-h siRNA incubation. Cells were then lysed and the levels
of total cellular DISC-related proteins (right, WB ) or DISC-related proteins
immunoprecipitated using a IgG antibody or an antibody targeting FADD (left )
were determined by Western blot. Lane 2, total or DISC-immunoprecipitated

Figure 6. HSP90a interacts with FLIPS, FLIPL, and RIP proteins in resting cells.
C40 cells were lysed and the levels of HSP90a, FLIPS, FLIPL, RIP, FADD,
TANK, and TRAF proteins were immunoprecipitated using either an IgG antibody
or an antibody targeting HSP90a (A), or levels of total cellular HSP90a, FLIPS,
FLIPL, RIP, FADD, TANK, and TRAF proteins (B ) were determined by Western
blot. a-Tubulin was used as a loading control. The data are representative of

stimuli, although this possibility, and the site of HSP90a interaction
with the DISC remains to be examined.
The ability of HSP to target FLIPS to the DISC in response to
TRAIL seems to be critical for the key role HSP90a plays in TRAIL
resistance in gliomas. Previous work from our lab showed that
activation of the Akt-mTOR pathway translationally up-regulates
FLIPS, and that high levels of FLIPS confer TRAIL resistance (39).
The present data, although consistent with this idea, adds a new
layer of complexity to FLIPS regulation. The present work shows
that high levels of FLIPS in the cytosol is not sufficient to confer
TRAIL resistance, and that in addition to high levels of FLIPS, cells
also need HSP90a to localize FLIPS appropriately. Because many
tumor cells (and all glioblastoma multiforme cells we have
examined) have elevated levels of HSP90a, low levels of HSP90a
do not seem to be a cause of TRAIL resistance. In work in

preparation, it also seems that the same Akt-mTOR pathway which
leads to a generalized translational up-regulation also leads to a
specific translational up-regulation of HSP90a, suggesting a
coordinate up-regulation of both client and chaperone protein by
the same pathway. The present data does, however, take on
increased significance in that they suggest that HSP90a inhibitors
may be efficient TRAIL-sensitizing agents. In data not presented,
the nonspecific HSP inhibitor geldanamycin does in fact sensitize
glioma cells to TRAIL in an action which seems to be, at least in
part, mediated through an HSP90a-dependent mechanism. HSP
inhibitors therefore represent a second class of agents (in addition
to mTOR inhibitors; ref. 50) that might be useful in sensitizing
tumor cells to TRAIL.
In addition to playing a key role in FLIPS localization and TRAIL
sensitivity, the present work suggests that HSP90a alters the DISC
localization of several antiapoptotic proteins, and by doing so, may
affect apoptosis in a more global manner than that previously
suspected. The present work shows that HSP90a interacts with at
least three antiapoptotic proteins (FLIPS, FLIPL, and RIP) in
untreated cells, and targets these proteins to the DISC in response
to TRAIL. Although FLIPL and RIP have been excluded from
playing a role in controlling TRAIL sensitivity in glioma cells (39),
both proteins have been reported to play key roles in controlling
the sensitivity of various cell types to a variety of other
proapoptotic agents (51, 52). The ability of HSP90a to localize all
three proteins (and potentially other DISC components), suggests
that HSP90a may facilitate global inhibition of apoptosis.
Consistent with this idea, HSP90 has been shown to interact with
and stabilize RIP, and by doing so, to suppress tumor necrosis
factor–induced apoptosis (45). The up-regulation of HSP90a noted
in many cancers may in fact be a prerequisite for tumor formation,
serving as part of a global response to suppress apoptosis
stimulated by undoubtedly harsh tumor microenvironmental
conditions. Although this idea has not formally been tested, the
ability of HSP inhibitors to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor
types suggests that an understanding of how HSP90a contributes
to protein localization may contribute to a better understanding of
cellular transformation, and ultimately to better cancer therapies.
