Abstract
Tamoxifen is widely prescribed for the treatment of breast
cancer and is also licensed in the United States for the prevention of this disease. However, tamoxifen therapy is associated with an increased occurrence of endometrial cancer
in women, and there is also evidence that it may elevate the
risk of colorectal cancer. The underlying mechanisms responsible for tamoxifen-induced carcinogenesis in women have not
yet been elucidated, but much interest has focused on the role
of DNA adduct formation. We investigated the propensity of
tamoxifen to bind irreversibly to colorectal DNA when given to
10 women as a single [14C]-labeled therapeutic (20 mg) dose,
f18 h before undergoing colon resections. Using the sensitive
technique of accelerator mass spectrometry, coupled with
high-performance liquid chromatography separation of enzymatically digested DNA, a peak corresponding to authentic
dG-N 2-tamoxifen adduct was detected in samples from three
patients, at levels ranging from 1 to 7 adducts/109 nucleotides.
No [14C]-radiolabel associated with tamoxifen or its major
metabolites was detected. The presence of detectable CYP3A4
protein in all colon samples suggests that this tissue has
the potential to activate tamoxifen to A-hydroxytamoxifen,
in addition to that occurring in the systemic circulation, and
direct interaction of this metabolite with DNA could account
for the binding observed. Although the level of tamoxifeninduced damage displayed a degree of interindividual variability, when present, it was f10 to 100 times higher than that
reported for other suspect human colon carcinogens such as
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. These findings provide a mechanistic basis through which tamoxifen
could increase the incidence of colon cancers in women.

Introduction
The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely prescribed drug
worldwide for the treatment of breast cancer.6 In 1998, it was also
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of breast cancer in healthy high-risk women on the basis
of trial data indicating an overall 49% reduction in the occurrence

of invasive breast cancer with tamoxifen treatment compared with
placebo in this population (1, 2). It has been estimated that
currently 2 million women in the United States would experience a
net benefit from taking tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent (3).
However, tamoxifen use is associated with a 2- to 8-fold increased
incidence of endometrial cancer (4), and there is some evidence
that tamoxifen also elevates the risk of gastrointestinal cancers by
as much as 3-fold (5). A specific increase in the frequency of
colorectal cancers has also been described in some studies (6, 7). In
addition, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported
tamoxifen was correlated with a modest but significant increase in
gastrointestinal cancers (8), although another recent overview of
randomized trials in early breast cancer does not support this
contention (9). Although tamoxifen does not seem to cause liver
cancer in women (10), in rats, hepatic tumors develop with chronic
dietary administration of doses >5 mg/kg (11). These liver tumors
are considered to arise through a genotoxic mechanism. Tamoxifen
activation involves conversion to a-hydroxytamoxifen, catalyzed
primarily by CYP3A4 in humans (12, 13). This metabolite can then
be further conjugated, generating the more reactive a-sulfate ester,
but whether this step actually occurs in human tissues has not yet
been confirmed (14). The resulting reactive carbocations are able
to bind predominantly to the N 2-position of guanine, forming
adducts including a-(N 2-deoxyguanosinyl)tamoxifen (dG-N 2-tam;
refs. 15, 16), which are proven mutagenic lesions in mammalian
cells (17, 18). Analogous reactions may also occur with other phase
I metabolites of tamoxifen (19, 20).
The underlying mechanisms responsible for tamoxifen-induced
carcinogenesis in women have not yet been elucidated. Studies
investigating the presence of tamoxifen DNA adducts in human
tissues have reported conflicting results, and there is much debate
over this issue and whether tamoxifen-induced DNA damage might
be a contributing factor in the development of cancers in women
(4). Low levels of the major dG-N 2-tam lesion formed in rat liver
have been detected in leukocytes and endometrial tissue of
tamoxifen-treated women by two groups using 32P-postlabeling
analysis (21–23). However, in each case, adducts were only
observed in samples from a fraction of the patients, indicating
variability in tamoxifen metabolic activation, the formation or
repair of DNA adducts. Other investigators have failed to detect
adducts in human samples, applying similar methods and
alternative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry approaches
(24, 25). Part of the reason for these discrepancies is the fact that

if damage is induced, it is likely to be close to or below the limits of
detection achievable with the assays typically employed. With this
is mind, we have previously used the technique of accelerator mass
spectrometry (AMS), one of the most sensitive adduct detection
methods available (26), to show that [14C]-tamoxifen binds to
endometrial and myometrial DNA in women at extremely low
levels (f400 adducts/1012 nucleotides) after administration of a
therapeutic dose (27).
Nothing is known regarding the ability of tamoxifen to induce
DNA damage in gastrointestinal tissue of women; therefore, we
have now investigated the propensity of tamoxifen to bind to
colorectal DNA when given as a single [14C]-labeled dose (20 mg)
prior to patients undergoing colon resections. We show evidence
for interindividual variation in the ability of tamoxifen to act as a
genotoxin and also describe efforts to characterize the nature of
the binding detected, which highlights some important issues
relating to the use of AMS for DNA adduct detection.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. unless stated otherwise. Tamoxifen citrate was a gift from
Dr. J. Topham (Zeneca plc, Macclesfield, United Kingdom). [1-PhenylU-14C]tamoxifen (2.03 GBq/mmol) of >98% radiochemical purity was from
Cambridge Research Biochemicals. N-Desmethyltamoxifen and a-hydroxytamoxifen were synthesized according to published methods (19, 28).
Gelatin capsules containing 1.85 MBq of [14C]-tamoxifen and 20 mg
unlabeled drug were prepared in the Radiopharmacy Department at
Leicester Royal Infirmary. The committed effective radioactive dose
equivalent was <180 ASv, which is below the natural background radiation
to which people are exposed in daily life during the course of a month (29).
Patients and sample collection. Study protocols were approved by the
Human Research Ethics Committee, Leicester Health Authority, the
Department of Health Committee on the Administration of Radioactive
Substances to Persons—the Medicines (administration of radioactive
substances) Regulation of 1978, United Kingdom, and the Institutional
Review Board at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).
Informed consent was obtained from all patients before studies commencing, and only those who had never previously been treated with tamoxifen
were eligible. Women recruited to the study (mean age, 60.4 years, range,
26–81 years) were nonsmokers and were undergoing colon resections
associated with inflammatory bowel disorders. Patients were not known to
have colon cancer and were not receiving any other drug therapies at the
time. Each patient was given 20 mg tamoxifen citrate containing 1.85 MBq
[14C]-tamoxifen f18 h before surgery. Venous blood (10 mL) was collected
in heparinized tubes at the time of surgery. Colon samples ( full thickness)
were taken from normal tissue and rinsed in ice-cold PBS and, after transfer
from theater, weighed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The exact location
of each tissue sample within the colon was not defined. Control tissue and
blood from a patient who did not receive [14C]-tamoxifen was also obtained
for determination of background 14C levels in DNA and plasma.

CYP3A4 Protein Quantitation
Tissue samples (f0.5 g) were powdered using a pestle and mortar
cooled in liquid N2 then suspended in an equal volume of ice-cold
lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 mmol/L NaF,
and 2 mmol/L Na2VO4]. Before use, one complete protease inhibitor
cocktail tablet (Roche) was added to 10 mL buffer. Samples were centrifuged (10,000  g, 5 min, 4jC) and the supernatant stored for up to
1 week at 80jC. Protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid procedure (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Equal amounts of protein (50 Ag) were separated on precast SDS 7.5%
polyacrylamide gels (Ready Gel, Bio-Rad). Human CYP3A4 (0.1 pmol;
Supersomes, BD Biosciences) was included as a standard. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Amersham

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

Hybond, ECL), and the filters were incubated overnight at 4jC with
antihuman CYP3A4/3A7 antibody (BD Biosciences) diluted 1:3,000.
Immunoreactive proteins were detected using antimouse peroxidase–
coupled secondary antibody diluted 1:2,500 (Sigma) and enhanced chemoluminescence system (Amersham). Chemiluminescence was quantitated
using Syngene Gnome image analysis (Syngene).

Measurement of Tissue and Plasma Concentrations
Plasma and tissue concentrations of [14C]-tamoxifen equivalents were
measured by liquid scintillation counting. Tissues (100 mg) were solubilized
in 1 mL NCS II tissue solubilizer [Amersham (Canada) Ltd.] overnight at
37jC. Scintillant (Optiphase HiSafe 2, Fisher Chemicals; 9 mL) was added,
and after allowing for chemiluminescent decay, samples were counted in
a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter (LKB Instruments).

DNA Isolation
DNA was extracted using Qiagen column chromatography (Qiagen Ltd.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was dissolved in water,
and the purity determined by the A 260/A 280 ratio. DNA samples (in solution)
were shipped to the LLNL National Resource for Biomedical AMS (NIH
project RR13416) for analysis.

Measurement of Protein Content in DNA Samples
Where sufficient DNA was available (100–150 Ag), the protein content
was determined using the QuantiPro High Sensitivity Protein Assay Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Total protein concentration was calculated from the
absorbance measured at 562 nm.

Digestion and HPLC Separation of DNA Samples
Where colon DNA was available, samples from [14C]-tamoxifen–treated
patients (numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and from the control patient were
digested to nucleosides and subject to HPLC separation. Briefly, each DNA
sample was split into four aliquots of 50 Ag and hydrolyzed in 30 AL
digestion buffer [40 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2 (pH 8.5)] using
DNase I (10 units), shrimp alkaline phosphatase (2 units), and snake venom
phosphodiesterase (0.05 units) for 2 h at 37jC. Enzymes were removed by
passing each digest through a Microcon filter (3,000 molecular weight
cutoff, Millipore), and then for each patient, the samples were combined
and concentrated to dryness.
Each DNA digest (typically 200 Ag) was separated using these conditions
on a Jasco HPLC system (Jasco, Chelmsford) designated for AMS samples
only, consisting of Intelligent HPLC pumps (PY-1580) and dynamic mixer
(HG-1580-32), an Intelligent autosampler (AS-1555) and a UV-Vis multiwave
detector (MD-1510) set at 254 nm. Samples were injected onto a Hypersil
BDS C18 column (4.6  250 mm, 5 A, Phenomenex) and eluted with
0.5 mol/L ammonium acetate (A) and methanol (B) at a flow rate of
1 mL/min over 40 min (0–5 min, 60% B; 5–7.5 min, 35% B; 7.5–12.5 min,
35% B; 12.5–15 min, 60% B; 15–20 min, 75% B; 20–25 min, 75%B; 25–27.5 min,
80% B; 27.5–35 min, 80% B; 35–40 min, 60% B). Two blank runs were done
in between samples to prevent cross-contamination, and fractions were
collected at 30-s intervals for the duration of each run. Individual HPLC
fractions were then concentrated to dryness under vacuum and shipped
to LLNL.
A sample containing authentic standards of tamoxifen, a-hydroxytamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and N-desmethyltamoxifen, along with digested
control human DNA, was analyzed under the same conditions. The dG-N 2tamoxifen adduct was prepared by reaction of a-acetoxytamoxifen with
salmon sperm DNA (15) and also subject to HPLC analysis for comparison
of retention times. The adduct structure was verified by mass spectrometry
using a Waters QuattroUltima Pt, operated in the positive ion mode. The
molecular mass was determined using a total ion scan, and then tandem
MS/MS was employed to further confirm the structure (Fig. 4C, inset).
Although it was not possible to determine the exact isomer, it is likely to be
a trans form because the a-acetoxytamoxifen used in the reaction was
predominantly the trans isomer (15).

AMS Measurement
Before analysis, each HPLC sample was redissolved overnight in 500 AL
methanol/water (70:30). DNA samples (500 Ag) and HPLC fractions were

supplemented with a precise amount of carrier (1 AL tributyrin, equivalent
to 615 Ag carbon) to provide sufficient carbon mass for optimal sample
preparation and AMS analysis. Samples were then converted to elemental
carbon using standard protocols by combustion to CO2, followed by
reduction to filamentous graphite (30). The resulting graphite was analyzed
by AMS, with each graphite sample analyzed up to seven times for
radiocarbon content or until the measurement variation was within F5%.
Data are presented as attomoles 14C per milligram DNA or per HPLC
fraction, and results from tamoxifen-treated patients are compared with
those from the control, untreated patient.

Results
In patients administered a single therapeutic dose of [14C]tamoxifen, the mean plasma concentration of [14C]-tamoxifen
equivalents was 14.7 F 2.5 ng/mL or f40 F 7 fmol/mg (mean F
SE, n = 10), which is consistent with other published reports,
including our previous study in hysterectomy patients given an
equivalent dose under an analogous treatment protocol (22 F 3 ng
tamoxifen equivalents/mL plasma or f60 F 8 fmol/mg; ref. 27).
The mean level of total [14C]-tamoxifen equivalents measured
in colon tissue was 653 F 135 fmol/mg tissue (Fig. 1), which
exceeds plasma levels by a factor of f16. Concentrations of total
[14C]-radiolabel displayed a degree of variability among individuals
with the highest, detected in patient 10, being 8.5-fold greater than
the lowest amount measured in patient 7.
Western blot analysis of tissue samples revealed CYP3A4 protein
was expressed in all patients to varying extents, with levels ranging
from 0.37 to 1.71 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 2). The presence of this
enzyme suggests that tamoxifen could be converted to metabolites
within colorectal tissue, including a-hydroxytamoxifen (13), which
may then be available for direct reaction with DNA.

Binding of [14C]-Tamoxifen to Human Colon DNA
The 14C content of DNA samples from the 10 tamoxifen-treated
patients is shown in Fig. 3 and can be compared with the
background level of 14C naturally occurring in colon DNA of an
untreated patient (46.3 amol/mg DNA). In all patients, the level of

C was significantly elevated above background concentrations,
ranging from 3.6- to 18.0-fold higher, which is consistent with the
presence of bound [14C]-tamoxifen. There was a strong positive
association between the tissue concentration of [14C]-tamoxifen
equivalents and DNA radiocarbon content (Pearson’s product
moment correlation coefficient, r = 0.88). However, there was no
correlation between DNA binding and CYP3A4 protein expression
for individual patients.
Extracted DNA from two patients was analyzed for the presence
of residual protein. Low amounts of contamination were detected,
with 1.97 and 2.24 Ag of protein present per 100 Ag of DNA in
samples from patients 2 and 9, respectively.

HPLC-AMS Analysis of Colon DNA
To establish if bound [14C]-radiolabel was covalently associated
with cellular DNA, where sufficient extracted DNA was still
available, samples were digested to 2¶-deoxynucleosides using a
method proven capable of efficiently hydrolyzing DNA to its
individual nucleosides, as indicated by HPLC analysis with UV
detection. Before injection, the digest was passed through a Micron
filter that removes material with a molecular weight >3,000,
thereby excluding any residual protein or peptide contamination
along with complexes of DNA containing tightly bound protein.
Initially, a total of 200 Ag DNA from both patient 1 and a control
patient was digested and subjected to HPLC separation, with
fractions collected at 30-s intervals to maximize peak resolution.
The HPLC system was developed to achieve adequate separation
between tamoxifen, its major metabolites, the dG-N 2-tamoxifen
adduct, and 2¶-deoxynucleosides as shown in Fig. 4C and D.
As would be expected, the reconstructed chromatogram from
the analysis of DNA from the control, untreated patient, illustrates
a low background level of 14C across the run (Fig. 4B). This is
consistent with the natural abundance of 14C in HPLC solvents and
general reagents, as well as that present in the DNA digest. The
lowest limit of detection for 14C by HPLC-AMS analysis, calculated
as the mean plus twice the SD of 14C in HPLC fractions from the
control DNA digest, was f2.75 amol, which translates to f400
adducts/1012 nucleotides in a single fraction.
The radiochromatogram produced for [14C]-tamoxifen–treated
patient 1 reveals two main peaks eluting at f11.5 and 23.5 min
(designated peaks 1 and 2, respectively, Fig. 4A). Importantly, no
peaks were observed at retention times corresponding to free
tamoxifen or any of its major metabolites, which indicates that
the DNA extraction procedures employed are capable of efficiently
removing any nonbound tamoxifen derivatives. In addition, there
is no excess 14C associated with the 2¶-deoxynucleosides, which
would elute around 3 to 4 min, confirming that the 14C detected in
DNA samples is not due to metabolic incorporation of this isotope
into the nucleotide pool. Importantly, peak 2 elutes at a time
consistent with the dG-N 2-tamoxifen adduct standard. The identity
of the more polar species in peak 1 is not presently known because
it does not coincide with any of the available tamoxifen derivatives
analyzed.
Based on results from the analysis of intact DNA from patient 1
(described above), f70 amol of 14C was digested and loaded onto
the HPLC column. The total amount of 14C recovered from the
column, calculated by the summation of the 14C content in all
40 HPLC fractions, was f80 amol, which is in good agreement
with the theoretical value, and indicates that the two peaks
observed account for virtually all the excess 14C detected by AMS
analysis of the intact DNA, suggesting that if samples were

contaminated with adducted protein, it does not significantly
contribute to the binding measured. Of this 80 amol, it can be
estimated that f9% was contained in the peak eluting where dGN 2-tamoxifen would be expected, which translates to a damage
level in the region of 1,050 adducts/1012 nucleotides.
To ascertain whether the results obtained for patient 1 were
representative of the response to [14C]-tamoxifen administration,
a number of 30-s fractions corresponding to the areas of interest
(10–12.5 and 22–25 min) from six of the other patients were also

analyzed. Due to the cost associated with AMS measurements,
it was not possible in this case to submit all 80 fractions for each
patient. The partial chromatograms in Fig. 5 illustrate considerable
variation among individuals. Patient 4 has a single large peak
corresponding in retention time to the dG-N 2-tam adduct; this was
also a major peak in the digest from patient 8, who had an
additional unidentified peak eluting a couple of minutes before the
adduct. The amount of 14C contained in the adduct peak for
patients 4 and 8 was f84 and 58 amol, which equates to f7,000
and 4,300 dG-N 2-tamoxifen adducts/1012 nucleotides, respectively.
In patients 3 and 7, no distinct peaks were evident, whereas very
small peaks were apparent in patients 5 and 6, but these did not
coincide with the dG-N 2-tamoxifen adduct standard, suggesting
that if such adducts were present, they must be below the limit of
detection. The discrepancy between excess total 14C measured in
intact DNA and that detected by HPLC-AMS for some patients may
be due to the presence of multiple minor [14C]-labeled components, eluting in areas of the chromatogram not selected for AMS
analysis. These findings support the need to conduct such HPLC
separations of adducted DNA for each compound under investigation when using AMS for adduct quantitation (24). Interestingly,
none of the other patients exhibited a peak eluting at the same
time as the polar peak 1 detected in patient 1, signifying that this is
not consistently formed as a result of tamoxifen intervention.

level of 12,185 adducts/1012 nucleotides), whereas the lowest concentration
was measured in patient 8 (169 amol/mg; equivalent to 2,472 adducts/1012
nucleotides). Each DNA sample (500 Ag) was analyzed on a single occasion

We have shown for the first time, using the high sensitivity of
AMS, the ability of tamoxifen to form DNA adducts in human colon
tissue following a standard therapeutic or chemopreventive dose.
It is known that postmenopausal estrogen treatment results in a
reduced risk of colorectal cancer (31, 32). Epidemiologic studies
have not yet revealed an unequivocal link between the use of
antiestrogenic tamoxifen therapy and colon cancers. Although the
original investigation of Rutqvist et al. (5) showed an excess of
gastrointestinal cancers associated with tamoxifen, the larger
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial
found no significant difference between the treatment arms in

secondary colon cancers (1). The present study indicates a
mechanistic route that could result in colon cancers, but does
not directly involve estrogen agonist or antagonist action.
In women treated chronically, tamoxifen is extensively distributed, and steady-state tissue concentrations are typically an order
of magnitude higher than plasma levels (33). The plasma concentrations of tamoxifen equivalents in this study were consistent
with published reports following a single dose (27, 34) and f16fold lower than tissue concentrations. In women undergoing
hysterectomy, uterine concentrations after one 20-mg capsule of
[14C]-tamoxifen were approximately 3-fold lower than that attained
in colon tissue (27). The relatively high tissue concentrations in

the present study may be attributed to the fact that the capsules
were given orally, delivering the contents directly to the gastrointestinal mucosa. It is also possible that although healthy tissue
was taken, the presence of inflammatory disease in adjacent tissue
could influence tamoxifen absorption.
Tamoxifen is metabolically activated via a-hydroxylation of
the parent compound and other phase I metabolites, a reaction
catalyzed by CYP3A4 in human tissues (13). Although in rat liver
the proximate reactive species is considered to arise as a consequence of further sulfation, the alcohol itself shows intrinsic
activity toward DNA albeit f1,600-fold weaker than the sulfate
ester (16). The presence of detectable CYP3A4 protein in colon

Tamoxifen Forms DNA Adducts in Human Colon

tissue of all 10 patients therefore indicates that a-hydroxytamoxifen may be formed in situ as well as occurring in the systemic
circulation (35). The high levels of DNA binding in rat liver is due
to the sulfation of a-hydroxytamoxifen by an isoform of hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, ST2A2 (36). Evidence suggests that
a-hydroxytamoxifen is a poor substrate for the human form of the
enzyme (SULT2A1) that produces in the region of 3-fold lower to
undetectable levels of a-sulfate tamoxifen compared with rat
hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (37, 38). Furthermore, SULT2A1
activity in human colon, measured using dehydroepiandrosterone,
is almost nonexistent relative to liver tissue (39). We therefore
propose that the low levels of binding detected in colon tissues by
AMS is primarily due to the direct interaction of a-hydroxytamoxifen with DNA, a reaction that may be enhanced by the slightly
acidic environment in the colon (15). It follows that the level of
adducts formed will be dictated by the concentration of tamoxifen
and a-hydroxytamoxifen in the tissue, which will be influenced by
tissue distribution and local CYP3A4 expression, balanced against
the activity of detoxification pathways. Consistent with this idea
is the strong positive correlation between total DNA binding and
[14C]-tamoxifen equivalents in the colon, with those patients
having the greatest tissue concentrations (1, 9, and 10) clearly
exhibiting the highest levels of DNA binding.
Rats given a-hydroxytamoxifen orally for 4 days (47 mg/kg per
day) show hepatic DNA damage, but surprisingly, none was
detected in the colon (40). Failure to detect DNA adducts may
be partly associated with the relatively lower sensitivity of
32
P-postlabeling methods used. In contrast, tamoxifen adducts
have been detected in multiple organs (brain, liver, uterus, ovary,
and kidney) of Cynomolgus monkeys after daily tamoxifen dosing
(2 mg/kg) for a month (41, 42). This supports the potential for
tamoxifen to act as a genotoxin in the colon of treated women.
HPLC-AMS analysis of digested DNA samples provides evidence
indicating that the [14C]-radiolabel in intact DNA was due to the
presence of covalently bound tamoxifen. Under steady-state
conditions, tamoxifen is >98% reversibly bound to plasma proteins
(33), and reactive metabolites of tamoxifen are also capable of
binding covalently to proteins. Minor amounts of protein contamination (f2%) were detected in extracted nondigested DNA
samples. This suggests that binding of [14C]-tamoxifen to protein
could conceivably contribute to the excess 14C measured above
background levels by AMS. However, for it to entirely account for
the 14C content, the extent of protein adduct formation would
have to be at least f44- to 50-fold higher than DNA adduct
formation. This is unlikely considering previous data comparing
[14C]-tamoxifen binding in uterine tissue, in which total protein
binding was only f14 times higher than DNA binding (27).
Furthermore, after DNA samples were digested to nucleosides, they
were filtered to remove enzymes and any partially hydrolyzed DNA
or protein contaminants before injection on the HPLC system.
While it is feasible that very small molecular weight adducted
peptides, <20 amino acids in length, may pass through the filter,
if such species were present, they would be expected to be as a
mixture of peptide adducts rather than a single entity and, therefore, produce a broad HPLC peak. It is therefore extremely unlikely
that tamoxifen-adducted peptides would account for a sharp,
discrete [14C]-radiolabeled peak as seen in some of the HPLC-AMS
runs. Another possible source of noncovalently bound radiolabel in
intact DNA might be free tamoxifen or its metabolites. However,
AMS analysis of the entire HPLC run of digested DNA from patient
1 confirmed that all nonbound tamoxifen and its metabolites

www.aacrjournals.org

were efficiently extracted during isolation and, therefore, do not
contribute to the [14C]-radiolabel measured. After a single dose,
[14C]-tamoxifen would be expected to be the predominant
circulating species in plasma (34) and account for the majority of
[14C]-radiolabel measured in whole tissue and plasma. All known
tamoxifen metabolites are more polar than the parent drug and
should therefore be more readily removed by the aqueous extraction methods employed. The absence of a peak corresponding
in retention time to tamoxifen in the chromatogram, particularly
in this patient, who had one of the highest concentrations of
[14C]-tamoxifen equivalents in the colon, is important because it
suggests that none of the peaks detected in other patients are due
to nonbound derivatives. Two peaks of radioactivity were evident
in the radiochromatogram for patient 1, the latter eluting peak
corresponding in retention time to the dG-N 2-tamoxifen adduct
standard and equivalent to a damage level of 1 adduct/109 nucleotides. This peak was also detected in DNA digests from patients
4 and 8 at a level of approximately 7 and 4 dG-N 2-tamoxifen
adducts/109 nucleotides, respectively. However, the dG-N 2-tamoxifen adduct, if present, was below the limit of detection (f0.4
adducts/109 nucleotides) in the other four patients. The limit
of detection for dG-N 2-tamoxifen adducts by conventional LC-MS/
MS analysis is 0.2 adducts/108 nucleotides, 10-fold higher than our
HPLC-AMS assay (43). Given the relatively high adduct levels
detected in two of the patients, colon DNA binding may have
also been detectable using LC-MS/MS. Interindividual variability in
the extent of a-hydroxytamoxifen DNA binding and/or the efficiency of adduct removal is consistent with data from Shibutani
et al. and Umemoto et al. These groups reported tamoxifen adducts
in endometrial DNA from only 8 out of 16 women and adducts in
leukocytes from 6 out of 47 breast cancer patients (21, 22).
The identities of the other peaks visible in the reconstructed
radiochromatograms from patients 1 and 8 are not currently
known. As discussed above, it is reasonable to rule out both phase
I and II tamoxifen metabolites together with adducted protein
and large peptides. Remaining possibilities include nucleoside
DNA adducts of a different structure, such as a-(N 6-deoxyadenosinyl)-tamoxifen (44) or dG-N 2-N-desmethyltamoxifen, a di/
trinucleotide adduct resistant to hydrolysis or unknown degradation products.
Interestingly, the urinary metabolite profile of the dietary
carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyimidazo[4,5-b ]pyridine
(PhIP) has recently been described as a possible predictor of
DNA adduct levels in colon tissue of humans administered a
dietary relevant dose of [2-14C]-PhIP (45). PhIP is bioactivated by
CYP1A2 to 2-N-hydroxy-PhIP, which is subsequently esterified,
producing the ultimate DNA-reactive species, O-sulfonyl or Oacetyl esters. As with [14C]-tamoxifen binding observed in the present study, the levels of PhIP DNA adducts in the colon displayed a
degree of variability, but more importantly, they were found to
negatively correlate with the urinary concentration of 2-N-hydroxyPhIP-N 2-glucuronide. This suggests that glucuronylation is a
significant detoxification pathway for N-hydroxy-PhIP in humans.
O-Glucuronylation of a-hydroxytamoxifen also serves as a speciesspecific protective mechanism in humans, as illustrated by the
fact that human liver microsomes catalyze this deactivation reaction at a rate >50 times more rapid than rat microsomes (46).
Differences in the expression and activity of glucuronyl transferases
either in the liver or locally in colon tissue, may therefore contribute to the different tamoxifen adduct levels detected in the
10 patients.

Cancer Research

The significance of potentially mutagenic tamoxifen-induced DNA
damage in the development of colon cancer is likely to be dependent
on numerous factors, including DNA sequence context, efficiency of
adduct repair, and rates of cell proliferation. However, in considering
the level of damage, it is worthwhile noting that in the present study,
where dG-N 2-tamoxifen adducts were detected, binding was in the
order of f10 to 100 times higher than that reported for other
suspect human colon carcinogens, MeIQx, PhIP, and benzo(a)pyrene
(47–49). Results suggest further epidemiologic studies on the
association between tamoxifen and colon cancer are warranted.
