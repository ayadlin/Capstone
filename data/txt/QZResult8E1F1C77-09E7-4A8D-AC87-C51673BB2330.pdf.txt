ABSTRACT
The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays a role in the regulation of most
cellular pathways, and its deregulation has been implicated in a wide range of human
pathologies that include cancer, neurodegenerative and immunological disorders and
viral infections. Targeting the UPS by small molecular regulators thus provides an
opportunity for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of several diseases.
The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib was approved for treatment of hematologic
malignancies by the FDA in 2003, becoming the first drug targeting the ubiquitin
proteasome system in the clinic. Development of drugs targeting specific components
of the ubiquitin proteasome system, however, has lagged behind, mainly due to the
complexity of the ubiquitination reaction and its outcomes. However, significant
advances have been made in recent years in understanding the molecular nature of
the ubiquitination system and the vast variety of cellular signals that it produces.
Additionally, improvement of screening methods, both in vitro and in silico, have led
to the discovery of a number of compounds targeting components of the ubiquitin
proteasome system, and some of these have now entered clinical trials. Here, we
discuss the current state of drug discovery targeting E3 ligases and the opportunities
and challenges that it provides.

INTRODUCTION

way to regulate the levels and/or activity of single or
sets of specific protein substrates, and thus an exciting
opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Hence, since
the discovery of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and
especially after the clinical success of the proteasome
inhibitor Bortezomib, targeting the UPS for therapeutics
has become a research focus in academia as well as in
pharmaceutical research [13]. However, identification of
drugs that specifically target components of the ubiquitin
cascade has lagged behind. In contrast, the field of kinase
inhibitors accelerated after the approval of the first kinase
inhibitor Gleevec in 2001, since a further 25 kinase
inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for clinical
use and many more are in clinical trials today [14, 15]. In
2003, Bortezomib was approved by the FDA for treatment
of multiple myeloma, although no drug targeting other
components of the UPS has been approved for clinical

Protein ubiquitination followed by proteasomal
proteolysis is the most common pathway of selective
protein degradation in the cell [1-5]. However, in addition
to signalling degradation, ubiquitination has been shown
to be involved in the regulation of almost every cellular
function [6]. In fact, up to 5% of the Arabidopsis genome
encode genes that are part of the ubiquitin machinery
illustrating the importance as well as the ubiquitousness
of this post-translational modification [7]. It is therefore
not surprising that deregulation of ubiquitin pathways
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous
human disorders including cancer, neurodegeneration and
inflammation [8-12].

application since [16]. The clinical success of Bortezomib
resulting from the complete block of proteasomal
degradation came as a relative surprise as the UPS controls
the levels of most cellular proteins. Indeed, its complete
inhibition is expected to have disastrous effects on cellular
homeostasis and exhibit cytotoxicity. Despite several
theories, the mechanism by which this drug induces cell
death in malignant relative to normal cells, is unclear,
as well the reasons why it is proven a beneficial therapy
in some cancer types but not others. Research efforts to
identify compounds that target specific components of
the UPS is underway, and aim at reducing the toxicity
of the treatment, circumventing resistance and targeting
a broader range of malignant diseases. One approach is
to target components within the ubiquitination cascade
to increase the specificity of the treatment to a subset of
proteins or even to a single substrate. This approach would
provide a much more elegant and expectantly less toxic
strategy to specifically target cancer cells (Figure 1).
This review aims to provide an overview of the
current state of drug discovery strategies involving the
UPS, especially focusing on one class of E3 ubiquitin
ligases (E3s), the HECT (Homologous to the E6AP Carboxyl Terminus) enzymes, that so far have received
little attention in the field of UPS related drug discovery.

(monoubiquitination) or a chain of ubiquitin molecules
(polyubiquitination). A ubiquitin chain can be formed via
linkage of any of the seven lysine residues in ubiquitin
(K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63) [29, 30] or less
commonly through the N-terminal methionine of ubiquitin
(M1, linear chain) [31, 32]. The complexity of the system
is further enhanced by the existence of several different
types of chains: (i) single linkage, (ii) mixed linkages
with different linkages in one chain, (iii) branched
linkages where one ubiquitin molecule in the chain is
attached to two ubiquitin molecules and lastly (iiii) chains
consisting of a mixture of ubiquitin and other ubiquitinlike molecules e.g. SUMO have been observed [33, 34].
Taken together this leads to almost endless possibilities
of protein modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin like
modifiers [10].

Proteolytic functions of ubiquitination
Generally, a chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules
linked by either K11 or K48 to a protein substrate is both
necessary and sufficient for recognition by the proteasomal
19S regulatory particle. Longer ubiquitin chains increase
the affinity of the proteasome for the substrate and thus the
probability of its degradation [29, 34]. Ubiquitin chains
linked by either of the seven lysine residues in ubiquitin
can associate with the proteasome in vitro, suggesting a
potential role in proteolysis for all of them [35-37]. This
raises the question why certain chains appear to lead to
degradation more commonly than others. One possible
explanation could lie in the deubiquitination activity of
the proteasome towards different chain linkages. A study
by Jacobson et al. [38] showed that while K63- and K48linked polyubiqutin chains associate with the proteasome,
the deubiquitinating rate of the linear K63 chains is around
6 fold faster than that of the more tightly packed K48
chains.  K63 linked chains are therefore released from the
proteasome upon complete de-ubiquitination faster than
K48 chains, which reside longer and are thus more likely
to be degraded [38, 39].
Different studies have demonstrated that in vivo,
chains linked via K6, K11, K27, K29 and K48 are
involved in protein degradation [35]. In addition to being
a key player in proteasomal degradation, ubiquitination is
also involved in autophagy and lysosomal degradation .
Ubiquitin chains linked by K63 were shown to mediate
lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins [40,
41]. Furthermore, monoubiquitination of receptor tyrosine
kinases has been demonstrated to recruit members of the
endocytic pathway resulting in endocytosis and lysosomal
degradation of the kinase [42-46]. Lastly, ubiquitin is
involved in autophagy signalling by binding to autophagy
receptors like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1 resulting in
autophagic degradation of the substrate [47, 48].

Functions of Ubiquitination
Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic, reversible
and coordinated post-translational modification that
most commonly provides a cellular tag for proteasomal
degradation. However, depending on the protein
ubiquitination state (mono-, multi- or poly-ubiquitination)
and on the type of ubiquitin chain, an array of other
functions of ubiquitination has become apparent in recent
years and the diverse effects of this modification are
emerging. The ubiquitin machinery consists of an enzyme
cascade comprising three enzymes: in a first step, the
ubiquitin- activating enzyme (E1) adenylates and thereby
activates an ubiquitin molecule which is then transferred
to the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) [17, 18]. This
ubiquitin charged E2 now binds an E3 ligase which
catalyses the transfer of the ubiquitin onto a lysine on the
target substrate [19].  Depending on the class of E3 ligase,
the ubiquitin is either directly transferred from the E2 onto
the substrate, with the E3 merely functioning as a scaffold
for the reaction (U-box and RING (Really Interesting New
Gene) E3s), or ubiquitin is transferred onto a cysteine
residue in the enzyme’s catalytic centre (HECT E3s),
and is then transferred onto the target substrate [20-25].
Ubiquitination is a dynamic process that is negatively
regulated by deubiquitinases (DUBs). These enzymes
catalyse the deconjugation of ubiquitin from substrates
or ubiquitin chains, acting as important regulators of the
ubiquitin machinery [26-28].

Proteolysis-dependent regulation of transcriptiona
factors

WWOX, which binds both proteins, and antagonizes
the Itch-∆Np63 interaction, thereby stabilising ∆Np63
protein levels [73, 74]. The WW-domain containing
protein, Pin1 was shown to interact with p63 and protect
it from ubiquitination by the WW domain containing E3
ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) [75, 76]. Itch is not the
only E3 ligase regulating p73 stability. Indeed, p73 was
additionally shown to be a substrate of the E3s Pin2 [77],
SCFFBXO45 [78] and more recently of TRIM32 [79].

One of the best-studied and characterised function
of the UPS is the control of transcription factor (TF)
activity by targeted proteasomal destruction [49]. The
UPS is deeply involved in the NF-κB activation pathway
[12] that critically regulates inflammatory responses
and contributes to the pathogenesis of malignancies
including multiple myeloma. NF-κB activation relies on
the phosphorylation-induced proteasomal degradation of
inhibitory proteins of κB family (IκB), which sequester
NF-κB in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells. Following
cell stimulation, IκB is rapidly ubiquitinated by the
SCFβTrCP E3 complex, and degraded by the proteasome,
unveiling a nuclear localization sequence on the NF-κB
proteins [50, 51]. These are then released from IκBs,
and translocate to the nucleus to induce the transcription
of target genes. Another well-described example of
TF controlled by the UPS is the main regulator of the
hypoxic response, HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor-1α).
Under normoxic conditions, the protein is constitutively
expressed, but instantly degraded by VHL (von HippelLindau)-mediated ubiquitination [52]. The VHL E3
complex only recognises the prolyl-hydroxylated form of
HIF1α. Under hypoxic conditions prolyl-hydroxylation of
HIF-1α by PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain) enzymes is
inhibited, thus abolishing VHL-mediated ubiquitination of
HIF-1α and resulting in its stabilisation and accumulation
[53, 54]. The transcription factor then transactivates the
expression of several genes including GLUT1, VEGF and
erythropoietin [52].
Another example of TFs regulated through the UPS
are the transcription factors of the p53 family, p53, p63
and p73. All three TFs are regulated by posttranscriptional
modifications including ubiquitination that signals for
their degradation. While ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation of the tumour suppressor p53 has been linked
to a plethora of E3s, the E3 MDM2 (mouse double minute
2) is the main and the best characterised regulator of its
protein levels and activity [55-58]. The other two family
members, namely p63 and p73, share some of the tumour
suppressive functions of p53 and, additionally, were
shown to be involved in skin and neuronal development
and stemness, respectively [59-62]. Both proteins are
regulated at the level of transcription and degradation.
The HECT E3 Itch (itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) has
been shown to be a primary regulator of both proteins by
targeting them for ubiquitination-mediated degradation.
Similarly to p53 and HIF-1α, the steady-state levels of
p63 and p73 are kept low by constant ubiquitin-dependent
degradation in unstressed cells [59, 63-69]. In response
to DNA damage, Itch activity is attenuated by means of
different mechanisms [70-72] and its inhibition results
in p63/p73 stabilisation and activation. p73 and the ∆N
isoform of p63 are regulated by the tumour suppressor

Non proteolytic functions of ubiquitination
The relevance of ubiquitination has also been
recognised in controlling other cellular functions including
protein-protein interactions, subcellular localisation,
transcription, epigenetic modifications, and DNA repair.
Cell signalling processes are predominantly regulated by
the K63-linked type of polyubiquitination [80]. However,
other non-degradable types of polyubiquitin chains such
K11 were described.

Protein-protein interactions
In addition to being bound by the proteasome,
ubiquitin and ubiquitin chains can interact with a
range of different proteins that contain an ubiquitinbinding domain (UBD). Around 200 cellular proteins
are estimated to contain a UBD with which they can
recognise ubiquitinated proteins and act as effector
molecules that signal to downstream cellular pathways
[81]. Thus ubiquitin can act as ‘molecular glue’ connecting
different proteins and aid complex formation. Conversely
ubiquitin can mask a protein-binding site and inhibit
binding of a certain subset of binding partners [82]. The
oncogene GTPase, K-Ras, for example is activated by
monoubiquitination at Lys-147.   While ubiquitination
of K-Ras has no effect on its ability to interact with and
hydrolyse GTP or activate downstream targets, it severely
abrogates interactions with factors involved in K-Ras
deactivation [GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)] by
occupying the binding interface, hence leading to K-Ras
activation [83, 84].  
Additionally, protein ubiquitination can lead to
conformational changes in the substrate, eventually
inhibiting binding of other proteins or affecting protein
activity. Ubiquitination of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase
(D2), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident type 1 integral
membrane enzyme, leads to transient conformational
changes within the D2-D2 dimer that inactivate
the enzyme. Deubiquitination of the dimer leads to
reactivation of its enzymatic activity, allowing tight
regulation of its function [85].

Cellular localisation

connected and that ubiquitination of Myc is required
for transcriptional activation [93, 94].  Subsequently,
several other transcription factors were shown to require
activity of their respective E3s in order to be fully active.
These include HPV E2, Gal-4, FOXO4, NF-κB and Tat
[95-99], although how ubiquitination leads to increased
transactivation of these proteins remains elusive. Different
mechanisms have been proposed, including recruitment
of co-factors and/or parts of the proteasome to the site
of transcription. An example is the viral transactivator
Tat (HIV-1). The transactivation activity of Tat requires
ubiquitination by the E3 ligase MDM2, which is
believed to lead to recruitment of the 19S particle of the
proteasome to the HIV-1 promoter activating Tat mediated
transcription [96].  
The fact that a number of transcription factors are
both activated and degraded by ubiquitination and that
several transcription factors have been shown to be most
active when least stable has led to the development of the
‘licensing’ or ‘kamikaze model’ where monoubiquitination
is required for the activation of TFs, but also inevitably
leads to polyubiquitination and destruction of the protein
[100, 101].  
Taken together, there appears to be a strong
connection between ubiquitination and transcription factor
function. Because TFs are key proteins, each regulating the
expression of a distinct set of genes in a context dependent
manner, manipulation of their ubiquitination may be
expected to have significant physiological consequences.

Several studies have linked ubiquitination with
cytoplasmic localisation of proteins. For example, nuclear
localisation of CTP-phosphocholine cytidyltransferase
(CCT-) is blocked when it becomes ubiquitinated at a
site that is close to its NLS; this prevents its interaction
with importin-α that delivers proteins to the nucleus [86].
Ubiquitination can also promote cytosolic localisation by
inducing nuclear export. For instance MDM2-catalysed
monoubiquitination of p53 induces nuclear-cytosolic
shuffling [87]. Export of p53 to the cytoplasm represses
its transcription function and concomitantly fosters
transcriptionally independent activities of p53, such as
apoptosis induction and autophagy inhibition (Reviewed
in [88]). Similarly, WWOX-mediated ubiquitination
of p73 and p63 promotes their cytoplasmic localisation
and subsequent transcriptional inactivation [73, 74,
89]. Furthermore, polyubiquitination of the regulatory
SMAD, SMAD3 that plays an important role in the TGFbeta signalling pathway, results in its nuclear export and
subsequent proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm
[90]. Less frequently, ubiquitination has been identified as
signalling for nuclear import. An example is site-specific
ubiquitination of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and
tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) that was
shown to result in nuclear import and thus activation of
the protein’s transcriptional activity [91].

Regulation of transcription factors by ubiquitin

Therapeutic targeting of the UPS

Promoting degradation is only one of several
mechanisms by which ubiquitination can control TF
activity.  Several recent studies have highlighted nonproteolytic outcomes of protein ubiquitination in the
control of TF function.  These range from changes
in protein localisation by mono-ubiquitination to an
intriguing direct link of TF activity and ubiquitination
[92]. Indeed, ubiquitination of TFs provides some
of the most striking demonstrations of the diverse
consequences of protein ubiquitination. Not only
does ubiquitination play a critical role in the negative
regulation of transcription factors, by targeting them for
destruction by the proteasome, there are also examples
where ubiquitination of TFs promotes their activity. This
model arises from the observations that in many cases
there is a structural overlap between transactivation (TA)
domains, the domains that are required for transcription
factor activity and degrons, the domains that signal their
destruction. This phenomenon is found in more than 30
transcription factors including the tumour suppressor
proteins p53 and TAp63 discussed above [92].
One of the first studies linking TF activity and
ubiquitination showed that the degron and TA domain
of the transcriptional activator Myc are functionally

Due to the enormous potential for intervention on
multiple pathologies, including cancer, the UPS represents
a suitable pharmacological target for drug development.
The discovery that proteasomal inhibition is a potent tool
to selectively induce cell death in cancer cells compared
with normal cells has resulted in the UPS becoming the
focus of attention as a drug target in cancer biology.
Selective cytotoxicity of Bortezomib  towards cancer
cells has been ascribed to their fast cell growth, which
would impose a greater workload on the proteasome.
The remarkable activity of the proteasome inhibitor
Bortezomib in clinical trials led to its approval by the
FDA in 2003 for treatment of relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma [16], and the drug was later approved
in clinical trials for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma, and
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [102-104]. Bortezomib
inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome
by reversible binding to the β5 subunit of the 20S
proteasome thereby impeding all proteasomal activity
and leading to accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins
in the cell [105, 106]. Several mechanisms have been
proposed to explain how proteasome inhibition leads to
cell death of cancer cells, including stabilization of the
pro-apoptotic proteins p27KIP1, p53 and Bax, defective

nuclear factor-kB activation, decreased interleukin-6
signalling and induction of oxidative and endoplasmic
reticulum stress [107, 108].  Furthermore, it has been
suggested that Bortezomib can inhibit angiogenesis [109]
and additionally that depletion of the cellular ubiquitin
pool by proteasome inhibition induces cell death in cancer
cells [110].
Despite its relative success in the clinic, the
therapeutic window of bortezomib is relatively
narrow, with toxic side effects ranging from peripheral
neuropathy, myelosuppression to cardiotoxicity, due to the
accumulation of misfolded proteins [111]. Additionally,
there is a relatively high incidence of both intrinsic and
acquired resistance to Bortezomib.  This is believed to
be mainly mediated by increased mRNA and protein
expression of the β5-subunit of the proteasome, mutations
in the subunit that inhibit binding of Bortezomib,
constitutive activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway
and upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone
protein GRP78 and P-glycoprotein, a multidrug resistance
protein [112, 113].   The FDA approved a second
proteasome inhibitor, Carfilzomib, in 2012 for treatment
of multiple myeloma for patients resistant to Bortezomib
[114]. Carfilzomib is an irreversible inhibitor, which
appears to be more potent and selective than Bortezomib.
However, the use of proteasome inhibitors as anti-cancer
drugs in the clinic is currently limited to lymphomas and
multiple myeloma with little success in treatment of other
tumours.  Hence, there is a major interest to identify drugs
targeting the proteasome that can be used for the treatment
of non-haematological tumours, as well as drugs with
reduced toxicity profiles and refractory to the development
of drug resistance.
One approach to target the UPS by limiting nonspecific side effects and enhancing pharmacological
effectiveness and potency is to block specific upstream
components such as E1, E2, E3 and DUB enzymes (Figure
1) [115-122]. Furthermore, deregulation of the ubiquitin
system has been shown to be involved in a plethora of
non-malignant diseases, promoting the idea that targeting
specific parts of the machinery might therefore not only
produce anti-cancer drugs, but could be used for treatment
of a range of diseases [9, 11].

is an irreversible pyrazone derivative, which irreversibly
binds to the active cysteine in UBE1 thus abrogating its
catalytic activity [124]. On the contrary, it did not display
inhibitory activity against other thiol-containing enzymes
[124]. PYR-41 is thought to kill tumour cells by inhibiting
cytokine-induced NF-κB activation, and promoting p53
accumulation, thus being more effective towards cancer
cells bearing wild-type p53.
In addition to UBE1, there are 7 other E1 enzymes
in the cell responsible for activation of other ubiquitin–
like modifiers.   To date inhibitors against two other
E1 enzymes, the SUMO-1 activating enzyme (SAE)
[125-127] and NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) have
been developed [128]. NAE inhibition indirectly affects
the UPS as NEDDylation is essential for the activation
of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex)
Cullin-containing E3 complexes and thus represents a
more specific approach than blocking UBE1. The small
molecule NAE inhibitor MLN4924 is an adenosine
sulfamate analogue that covalently binds the nucleotidebinding site of NAE. This results in the formation of a
NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct that blocks the enzymatic
activity of NAE, hence abrogating cullin NEDDylation
and the SCF activity [128]. This is particularly relevant
in cancer as several substrates of SCF play fundamental
roles in cancer development, and their stabilisation upon
SCF inhibition leads to cell cycle arrest, senescence and
apoptosis. These biological effects are likely achieved
through the accumulation of p27, NRF2, CDC25A,
HIF1α and IκB. MLN4924 was also found to inhibit
tumour angiogenesis [129]. This compound is currently
being tested in phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of
hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies [130].

E2 inhibitors
E2 enzymes, which act as intermediates between
the E1 and E3 proteins, have been shown to play a role
in determination of the type of the polyubiquitin chain
linkage. Since the E2 enzymes bind E1, E3 and ubiquitin,
they could be targeted at different interaction surfaces.
Because each E2 can associate and cooperate only with
a specific set of E3s, in principle, the more promising
and specific approach would be to block the E2-E3
association.  Thus far these enzymes have received less
attention as drug targets than other parts of the ubiquitin
cascade. Among the few compounds developed, CC0651,
is an allosteric inhibitor of human Cdc34, the E2, which
cooperates with the SCF E3 complexes. CC0651 binding
to Cdc34 leads to conformational changes in the enzyme
that impinge on the discharge of ubiquitin to acceptor
lysine residues. The therapeutic value of this compound
relies on the protection of p27KIP1 from degradation
through the abrogation of its ubiquitination by SCFSkp2
[131]. Because p27KIP1 is a cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk)
inhibitor that negatively regulates cell cycle progression, it

E1 inhibitors
Targeting the human ubiquitin activating enzyme
(UBE1) and therefore the first step of the ubiquitination
cascade has become a focus in drugging the proteasome
system. Like proteasome inhibition, this would inhibit
degradation of all proteins that are targeted for destruction
by the UPS. However, it would additionally affect
pathways in which ubiquitination plays a regulatory, nonproteolytic role.  A number of compounds that inhibit
UBE1 activity have been identified (see review [123]), the
first cell-permeable one being PYR-41. This compound

may prove to be an important target for cancer therapy. In
addition, NSC697923, an inhibitor of the Ubc13–Uev1A
E2 enzyme blocks the formation of the E2–Ub thio-ester
conjugate. Since Ubc13–Uev1A catalyses the formation of
K63-linked poly-Ub chains, this compound has inhibitory
activity against NF-κB signalling activation, which
ultimately leads to reduced proliferation and viability of
cancer cells [132].

considerable research efforts, the identification of E3
inhibitors has been limited, partly due to the fact that
researchers have primarily focused on disrupting the
enzyme/substrate interaction that is considered more
difficult to target than a catalytic site. Hence, even
though, in principle, HECT E3 represent a more easily
and promising druggable target than RING enzymes, so
far they have received less attention as potential cancer
therapeutics. As a result the majority of the small molecule
inhibitors reported so far target RING-finger type
enzymes, and several are currently undergoing evaluation
in clinical trials [134].
The search for E3 inhibitors has mainly focused on
a handful of E3s that have been found to be involved in
cancer development, with a vast amount of research effort
focusing on the identification of inhibitors of MDM2,
IAP and SCF E3s (see table 1 for an overview of E3
inhibitors). There are three main strategies employed to
develop inhibitors for E3 ligases, (i) to directly inhibit
their enzymatic activity, (ii) to target the substrate binding
interface or (iii) to affect the expression of the protein by
transcription or translation inhibition. One concern when
targeting the enzymatic activity is the fact that numerous
E3s possess auto-ubiquitination capacity that generally
promotes their degradation [135]. As a result, inhibition
of E3 activity often abrogates its autoubiquitination, as
well as substrate directed activity, and thus stabilises the
E3 protein as well as its substrates. A stabilised pool of E3
that still binds, but not ubiquitinates its substrates, could
have an unfavourable effect on the substrate activity.
Formation of E3:substrate complexes could, for example,
impair binding of other proteins to the substrate. This issue

E3 inhibitors
The E3 is the last enzyme in the ubiquitin cascade
that is responsible for substrate specificity. So far
approximately 600 E3 ligases have been identified.  Each
E3 ligase can bind and ubiquitinate a set of substrates and
hence inhibition of a particular E3 is expected to affect
only the pathways that are regulated by that enzyme
[82, 133]. The selectivity of ubiquitination provided
by the E3s may address, at least in part, the specificity
issue highlighted above and it is in contrast to the case of
proteasome or E1 inhibitors. Specific targeting of a limited
set of substrates theoretically may lead to fewer toxic side
effects and to a more suitable targeted therapy. 
E3s can be divided into three families: RING,
U-box- and HECT-containing E3s.   Both RING and
U-box do not possess intrinsic catalytic activity and act
by simultaneously binding to E2, ubiquitin and substrate,
merely providing a scaffold for the ubiquitination reaction.
Targeting RING or U-box E3s thus requires development
of allosteric or protein-protein inhibitors. In contrast,
as HECT E3s have intrinsic enzymatic activity, their
inhibition implies blocking the catalytic site. Despite

development. Small molecules and peptides are being developed that either affect the intrinsic activity of enzymes involved in the cascade

the E3 activity entirely. Selected E3 as novel anticancer
targets will be discussed below.

the first published results of phase I clinical trials with
the second generation Nutlin compound, RG7112, for the
treatment of liposarcoma have been rather disappointing.
While analysis of patients biopsies showed an increase
in p53 and p21 levels in response to RG7112 treatment,
out of twenty patients only one showed a partial response,
fourteen had stable disease and five showed disease
progression. Furthermore, the drug showed relatively
severe side effects including thromboycytopaenia and
neutropaenia [144]. Results of two other clinical trials
using the same compound in AML and soft tissue sarcoma
are awaiting publication. The toxic side effects observed
in the liposarcoma patients could be due to upregulation of
PUMA and NOXA by stabilised p53 leading to apoptosis
in normal cells, thus being the results of Nutlin on-target
effects [143]. This illustrates one of the main concerns
of p53 stabilising therapy, the effect of p53 activation on
normal cells and whether cell death can be selectively
induced in cancer over normal cells using p53 activators.  
Results of the on-going clinical trials using different
MDM2 inhibitors will hopefully shed light on the severity
as well as prevalence of toxicity of MDM2 inhibitors,
and might help to develop methods of administering the
compounds in a less toxic manner. p53 can induce both
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and it was recently shown
that the outcome of p53 activation is dependent on an
expression threshold of p53 protein and its targets [145].
As cancer cells have been shown to be more sensitive
to p53 induced apoptosis than normal cells, it has been
suggested that administering MDM2 inhibitors in frequent
small doses might circumvent apoptosis in healthy cells,
but induce cell death in cancer cells [143]. More research
into the effect of MDM2 inhibitors on healthy tissue will
be necessary to fully exploit MDM2 inhibition in the
clinic.

MDM2
Since p53 inactivation is a crucial step in
tumorigenesis, restoring its function is a hotspot for cancer
drug development [136-138]. p53 is a transcription factor
that has been shown to play a major role in the cell’s
response to oncogenic stresses and tumour suppression by
inducing cell cycle arrest, senescence, anti-oxidative stress
responses or apoptosis (reviewed in [139])[140].  With
~50% of all human malignancies carrying a mutation in
the p53 gene, the tumour suppressor is one of the most
commonly mutated proteins in human cancers [141].
The RING-type E3 MDM2 is the main regulator of the
p53 tumour suppressor protein [55-57] (Figure 2). Under
normal conditions, p53 levels are kept low by MDM2mediated ubiquitination, leading to its degradation. Only
in response to activating stimuli MDM2 is inhibited and
p53 stabilised. Indeed, high activity of MDM2 has been
observed in different cancers leading to the reduction or
loss of p53 protein [142].
Targeting MDM2 by small molecules that prevent
binding and/or ubiquitination of p53 has therefore been a
major research interest in recent years and four compounds
that block the MDM2-p53 interactions are currently being
tested in phase I clinical trials (reviewed in [143]). The
first inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction was Nutlin.
Nutlin was shown to bind to MDM2 and disrupt binding
of the p53 N-terminus to the hydrophobic pocket of the
E3; thereby abolishing MDM2 mediated suppression of
p53. Subsequently, a number of compounds have been
identified that disrupt the p53-MDM2 interaction and these
are currently in pre-clinical development [143]. However,

Figure 2: p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop. In response to its activation the tumour suppressor p53 leads to expression of a

number of target genes including its key regulator MDM2. The E3 ligase MDM2 then mediates p53 ubiquitination leading to its proteasomal
degradation. This negative feedback ensures fine control of the duration of the p53 response and immediate termination upon loss of p53
stimulating signals. MDM2=Mouse double minute 2.

is the case for p53 [172, 173], p63 is an important factor
in cancer response to therapy as p63 and p53 are found
in similar molecular complexes that mediate cisplatin
resistance [174]. Furthermore, the ∆Np63 isoform was
shown to mediate a pro-apoptotic response to cisplatin by
regulating the expression of micro-RNAs [175]. Indeed,
the ∆Np63 isoform directly induces the expression of the
oncogenic mir-155, which drives tumor cell migration and
growth [176] and p63 depletion promotes a metastasis
program in prostate cancer through regulation of mir-205
[177]. p63 and p73 can activate an internal p53 promoter

The members of the p53 family, p53, p63 and
p73 have been shown to encompass overlapping target
genes, interact with one another [146] and play similar
biological roles [147-149]. These include common roles
in the protection of the reproductive system [150-152],
in development [153-159], aging [160, 161], cell death
[162-164], cancer [159, 165-167], redox regulation [161,
168, 169], and metabolism [168, 170, 171]. Moreover, as

inhibition of RIP1-mediated ubiquitination inhibits NF-kB
activation [192, 193]. This has stimulated pharmaceutical
companies to developed IAP inhibitors based on the IAPSmac interaction. The drugs were designed to mimic Smac
and are reported to induce IAP autoubiquitination resulting
both in its degradation and activation of the TNF-pathway
that induces cell death. IAP inhibition also suppresses
proinflammatory cytokine production by TLR signalling
and it has been suggested that IAP inhibitors therefore
might be able to be used for the treatment of chronic
inflammatory diseases [14, 194, 195].

and thereby control the expression of p53 isoforms
[178], furthermore, p63 binds to mutant p53 affecting its
tumorogenic functions [179, 180]. Structuraly, there are
similarities between p53 and p73 as both are found in
an ‘open’ tetrameric conformation while p63 is iterating
between a ‘closed’ dimeric conformation under resting
conditions and ‘open’ tetrameric conformation when
activated by DNA damage [181]. 	
Blocking ubiquitination-mediated degradation of
p63 and p73 is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy.
While p53 is ubiquitinated by MDM2 [182], p63 and
p73 are ubiquitinated by the HECT E3 Itch, which marks
them for proteasomal degradation [67, 68]. Indeed, Itch
inhibition results in increased sensitivity of cancer cells
to cytotoxic drugs independently of their p53 status [89].
A possible strategy to inhibit p63 or p73 ubiquitination
is to interfere with Itch binding. p63-Itch binding occurs
through a PPxY motif found in p63 and the WW2 domain
of Itch [68]. Furthermore, this interaction is facilitated by
tran/cis proline isomerization of the adjacent (T/S)P motif
by the Pin1 prolyl-isomerase [183]. In accord, a p63-PPxY
motif containing cyclic peptide was shown to bind Itch in
vitro [64]. Moreover, the cyclic peptide binds metal and
the peptide-metal complex was demonstrated to induce
oxidative damage to the WW2 domain of Itch suggesting
that this could be a therapeutic strategy to interfere with
Itch-p63 interaction and the resulting p63 degradation [64,
65] (Figure 3).
Similarly to the Itch- p63 interaction, the interaction
of Itch with p73 occurs through a PPxY motif found in
p73 and the WW2 domain of Itch [68]. Interestingly, YesAssociated Protein (YAP) binds to p73 [184], preventing
Itch-p73 interaction and leading to increased p73 levels
and activity [185]. This YAP-p73 axis was shown to be
important in activation of apoptosis by c-Jun following
DNA damage as YAP is a target gene of the active c-Jun
[186] (Figure 3). p73-Itch interaction is also negatively
regulated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
which phosphorylates p73 and increases its stability [187]
(Figure 3).
Inhibitors
of
Apoptosis
(IAPs)
A promising group of E3s as drug targets in cancer is
the IAP (anti-apoptotic proteins) family [188] that is
augmenting the anti-apoptotic NF-kB pathway and
inhibiting the pro-apoptotic apoptotic caspases and Smac
proteins [59, 189]. The  IAP proteins c-IAP1, c-IAP2,
XIAP, ML-IAP and ILP-2 contain a RING domain and
ubiquitinate several molecules involved in apoptosis
signalling, and cancer [190] thus affecting their function
or leading to their degradation (reviewed in [191]). One
example is C-IAP1/2 mediated polyubiquitination of RIP1
(Receptor-interacting protein 1) [192].  RIP1 promotes cell
survival by activating NF-kB and polyubiquitination of
RIP1 by K63 linked chains is required for this activity. The
ubiquitin-RIP1 complex serves as a scaffold for assembly
of the IKKα-IKKβ-IKKγ signalling complexes.  Thus
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Skp2
Another attractive E3 that could be exploited
for cancer therapy is Skp2 (S-phase kinaseassociated  protein  2), an F-box protein that forms part
of the SCF complex. Skp2 targets the cell cycle inhibitor
p27 for ubiquitination and degradation and was shown
to possess oncogenic properties [196].  Remarkably,
p27 is downregulated in numerous malignancies,
which is believed to be due to excessive SCF-mediated
ubiquitination [197-200]. Several compounds have been
identified that inhibit Skp2 activity and are currently in
pre-clinical development [201-203]. In addition, inhibitors
of other components of the SCF complex have been

millions of compounds from virtual drug libraries. These
are becoming faster and more accurate with advances
in computer processing power and this technology is
becoming more widely accessible [208]. Furthermore,
crystal structures of proteins, which are required for the
screen, are more readily available. Often, computer-based
screens are coupled to a second molecular or cellular in
vitro screen of compounds that obtained a high score in
silico. Using virtual screening Chan et al [201] recently
discovered an inhibitor of the tumor promoting E3 ligase
Skp2, ♯25, which exhibited anti-tumour activity in
cells and animal models. Skp2 is involved in cell cycle
progression, metabolism, metastasis and senescence and
was shown to be deregulated in a number of cancers.
Compound ♯25 was identified using a structure-based
high-throughput virtual screen of 120,000 drugs linked
to an in vitro binding assay of purified Skp2 protein of
the top hits.  Validation of compound ♯25 showed that
it effectively inhibits Skp1/Skp2 interaction and Skp2
mediated p27 ubiquitination as well as tumour growth in a
mouse xenograft model [201].
Another interesting approach to inhibit
ubiquitination of a specific substrate is to block the
ubiquitination of the target rather than blocking the E3
ligase and therefore the ubiquitination of all its targets. This
was demonstrated by a study that identified an inhibitor
of the ubiquitination of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein
whose downregulation is linked to Friedreich’s ataxia, a
neuro-and cardiodegenerative disorder.  Lavecchia et al.
[209] identified the ubiquitination site on frataxin and
modelled the position of ubiquitin on the protein surface
using in silico docking programs. Next, they used structure
based virtual screening coupled with a cell-based assay
of the 13 top hits, and identified a small molecule that
disrupts the frataxin-ubiquitin interactions and thereby
inhibits frataxin ubiquitination [209].
In addition to using in silico screens as a first step
to identify potential drug candidates from a drug library,
computational methods have also been found useful in
characterising and optimising existing E3 ligase inhibitors.
The known crystal structure of protein complexes can be
used to identify peptides within a protein-protein interface
that can be used to inhibit the interaction and then
optimised further using molecular modelling techniques
[210]. This approach provides several advantages, as
peptide inhibitors are expected to be more selective and
potent due to intrinsic peptide flexibility that can adapt
to protein surfaces [210]. Another advantage of using
peptides as therapeutic agents is that they accumulate
less in tissue. The main challenge of using peptides in a
clinical scenario is due to their poor metabolic stability
as well as cell membrane permeability. These limitations
may be overcome by development of stapled peptides that
can be used to stabilise alpha helical structures that renders
the peptides resistant to proteolysis and increases their cell
permeability. The technique, developed by Blackwell and

DUBs
DUBs are the enzymes that remove ubiquitin from
modified proteins or ubiquitin chains and, not surprisingly,
have been shown to be involved in the regulation of
almost all ubiquitin-dependent pathways. Approximately
80 DUBs have been described in man and many of them
have been implicated in disease development, suggesting
that they may also form a potential drug target [9, 26,
206]. While inhibiting DUBs that deubiquitinate specific
proteins leads to stabilisation of their substrates, targeting
proteasome associated DUBs results in proteasome
inhibition.
DUBs can be divided into six sub-families, which
vary in the degree of their chain and substrate specificity:
ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ovarian-tumor
proteases (OTUs), Machado-Joseph disease protein
domain proteases, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases
(UCHs) and the recently identified monocyte chemotactic
protein-induced protein (MCPIP). All DUBs are cysteine
proteases with the exception of JAMMs which are
metalloproteases [206]. Due to their catalytic centre,
DUBs are predicted to be drugable targets, and inhibiting
DUBs could circumvent the challenge of developing
activators of E3 ligase activity.  
A number of inhibitors have been developed
that either target specific enzymes or DUB
subgroups.  Recently, Ernst et al [207] reported DUB
inhibitors that are based on ubiquitin variants, as DUBs
bind to ubiquitin or polyubiquitin chains. Using a
phage display approach the authors identified ubiquitin
mutants with an increased affinity to specific DUBs
compared to wild type ubiquitin and found that these act
as competitive inhibitors of DUB activity. The ubiquitin
variants lack the two N-terminal glycine residues and
can thus not be utilised by the E1, E2, E3 cascade for
protein ubiquitination. The study furthermore identified
ubiquitin variants that display high specificity and binding
affinity for the HECT E3 ligases Itch and E6AP and the
Cdc34 E2 enzyme. Further study of these molecules will
be necessary to show if these can be used as effective
inhibitors of E3 and E2 ligase activity respectively [207].

Grubbs, [211], utilises non- natural amino acids to form
an all-carbon cross link of the peptide. Several groups
are currently developing stapled peptide inhibitors of
MDM2 that bind to the p53-binding interface on MDM2
and thus abrogate the MDM2-p53 interactions [212-214].
Furthermore using in silico modelling, a known E3 ligasesubstrate interaction site can be exploited as a template for
rationale design of small molecular inhibitors. Buckeley
et al. [215, 216] developed a hydroxyproline analogue
inhibitor of the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) E3 ligase,
the main regulator of HIF-1α, based on the interaction
between Hyp564 on HIF-1α and VHL.

is determined using an antibody that detects ubiquitin,
either directly or by an ubiquitin-fused tag e.g. FLAG. The
ubiquitin antibody is coupled to a system that allows
quantification i.e. HRP (Horse Radish Peroxidase) or an
ORIGEN-tag [218, 219]. In addition to immobilisation on
a microtiter plate, beads can be used. The alpha screen
technology for example, allows immobilisation of two
proteins that carry a distinctive protein tag, e.g. His6
and GST (Glutathione S-Transferase). One protein is
immobilised on the donor and the other on the acceptor
alpha screen beads. Upon illumination the donor beads
are able to convert oxygen to reactive singlet oxygen,
which can excite acceptor beads in close proximity (up
to 200 nm) to emit light at a specific wavelength and this
can be detected [220]. The advantage of this technique is
that, whilst immobilised, all components are present in
solution. The technique has been used to screen for drugs
that interfere with substrate-E3 binding [202], but can
also be used to directly measure ubiquitination efficiency
if ubiquitin is immobilised on the beads. As compounds
identified by any of these in vitro methods to block
ubiquitination could potentially act on any of the three
enzymes involved in the reaction, i.e. E1, E2 and E3, it
is important to test any hits for their inhibitory potential
towards the E1 and E2 enzymes employed in the reaction
to select inhibitors that specifically target the E3 enzyme.

In vitro
In vitro HTS are based on identification of
compounds that lead to drug-induced interference of
E3-substrate interaction or reduction of substrate or E3
ubiquitination. The assays developed so far can be divided
in two sub-groups. In the first type of assay all components
are free in solution, whereas in the second, the substrate
(target protein or E3 ligase) is immobilised on beads or a
plate with the other components of the reaction in solution.
Several fluorescence-based assays that measure the
proximity of either E3-substrate or substrate-ubiquitin in
solution have been set up.  FRET (fluorescence resonance
energy transfer) assays that are routinely used in HTS
have been employed for inhibitor screens. As a read out
for protein ubiquitination or protein-protein interaction,
the substrate of interest and ubiquitin or E3, respectively,
are labelled with chromophores. One molecule is acting as
the donor and the other as the acceptor; only when the two
proteins and therefore the two chromophores are in close
proximity can energy be transferred from the donor to the
acceptor chromophore leading to emission from both the
donor and the acceptor upon donor excitation [217]. The
ratio between donor and acceptor emission can be used
as a measure of protein-protein interaction and thus as a
read-out of the efficiency of substrate modification with
ubiquitin or E3-substrate interaction. In addition to FRET
assays, a fluorescent polarisation based assay has been
utilised where the displacement of an E3 ligase interacting
fluorescein labelled peptide is determined as a measure
of the E3 – substrate interaction efficiency. The technique
was used to identify an allosteric inhibitor of the yeast
F-box E3 ligase Cdc4; the inhibitor blocks substrate
interaction and thus CDC4 mediated ubiquitination [205].
Alternatively, techniques where the ubiquitinated
component of the reaction is immobilised on a microtiter
plate have been developed. As most E3 ligases possess
autoubiquitination activity, this is commonly used as a
measure of the enzymes catalytic activity to simplify the
reaction. After the ubiquitination reaction has taken place
all additional components of the reaction are washed
away and the amount of ubiquitin attached to the E3
ligase or substrate is quantified. The amount of ubiquitin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In cells
So far only one HTS screen for E3 ligase inhibitors
utilising a cell-based assay has been reported. The study
that aimed to identify inhibitors of MDM2 E3 ligase
activity took advantage of the fact that MDM2 possesses
autoubiquitination activity that leads to its degradation.
Using MDM2-luciferease fusion proteins the levels
of MDM2 protein in response to drugs from a library
consisting of 270,080 compounds was evaluated by
measuring luminescence. In parallel the effects of the
drugs on a mutant protein MDM2-(C464) that does not
exhibit E3 ligase activity was determined. Compounds
that reduced levels of wild-type MDM2 but not the
mutant form were selected as the authors reasoned that
the reduction, in these cases, must be due to alteration
of MDM2’s E3 ligase activity and not its transcription,
translation or regulation by other E3 ligases [221]. The
advantage of this approach is that active compounds
identified by the technique should be specific to the
E3 ligase and not E1 or E2 enzymes.  Additionally, the
selected compounds are known to be active in a cellular
environment; however a catalytically deficient E3 ligase
mutant is required.

(chain elongation) or the E3 itself (autoubiquitination).
While the C-terminus is required for its catalytic activity
and E2 interactions, the N-terminal part of these proteins
is mainly responsible for substrate interactions and thus
determines the specificity of the enzyme [222]. While
the linkage and length of ubiquitin chains catalysed by
RING type E3s depends on the specific E2/E3 pair, in the
case of HECT E3s chain specificity is mainly provided
by the E3 ligase alone – making the outcome of HECT
E3-mediated ubiquitination more predictable than that of
RING E3s. However, how chain specificity is achieved
mechanistically remains to be investigated in detail,
although it appears to be a combination of substrate and
binding partners [222]. There are three main families of
HECT E3 based on the N-terminal region of the enzymes:
Nedd4 (9 members), HERC (6 members) and other HECTs
(13 members) [224-226]. Deregulation of HECT E3s was
shown to play an important role in the development of
several different kinds of human pathologies, including
cancer [10, 59, 227] and neurodegeneration [228, 229]
(see table 2 for list of HECT E3s implicated in human
diseases). As we are developing a better understanding of
the role of different HECT proteins and their involvement

While the possibility to exploit the UPS and E3
ligases has been studied extensively in recent years, HECT
E3 have received surprisingly little attention as potential
drug targets, despite the fact that several HECT E3s have
been implicated in the pathology of a range of different
human diseases [10, 222, 223] (see table 2) and that they
are expected to be easier to target than RING and U-Box
E3s due to their catalytic centre. HECT enzymes were the
first E3s to be discovered in 1995 [22]; subsequently a
total of twenty-eight human and five yeast HECT E3s have
been identified [222]. HECT E3 ligases are characterised
by a C-terminal HECT domain consisting of ~350 amino
acids, which, unlike RING and RING type domains,
contains intrinsic catalytic activity. The HECT domain
interacts with ubiquitin charged E2 enzymes, primarily
members of the UbcH5 family and UbcH7. Upon
interaction, the ubiquitin molecule associated with the E2
forms a thioesther bond with a conserved cysteine in the
catalytic centre of the HECT domain. Next, the ubiquitin is
transferred onto a lysine residue in the target protein; this
can be either a substrate of the E3, an ubiquitin molecule

in human diseases, small molecular modulators of HECT
E3 activity could provide powerful tools in the treatment
of HECT E3-associated diseases.
A paper recently published by our group [230]
demonstrated the first high throughput screen for small
molecular weight inhibitors of the HECT E3 ligase
Itch. Using an ELISA based HTS screen, the ability of
~20,000 compounds to inhibit Itch autoubiquitination
was determined (Figure 4A). The screen showed that a
comparably low proportion of these small molecules
possessed inhibitor activity, and identified only six hits
that exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of Itch. The

compounds were further tested towards their potential
to inhibit Itch-mediated substrate ubiquitination,
and only one compound was shown to inhibit Itch
autoubiquitination and p73 ubiquitination. Further
analysis of the inhibitor showed that while it had no
inhibitory effect on two RING E3s, Diap and RING1B, it
prevented autoubiquitination of the HECT E3 E6AP and
thus appears specific for this sub-family of E3s. The small
molecule compound identified through this approach was
clomipramine, a clinically useful antidepressant drug. The
effects in cancer cells treated with clomipramine included
reduction of cell growth, and synergism with gemcitabine

Figure 4: Development of an Itch inhibitor. (A) Flowchart of a high throughput screen to identify Itch inhibitors. The screen

was carried out using an ELISA based assay with Itch immobilised on the plate and all other components of the ubiquitination reaction
in solution. Itch ubiquitination was determined using an antibody detecting poly-ubiquitin. The effect of ~21 000 compounds on Itch
autoubiquitination was determined. Compounds that showed an inhibitory effect were further validated using dose response curves of the
ELISA based assay and in vitro ubiquitination assays with the Itch substrate p73. In a further validation step an effect of the identified
compound, clomipramine, on the E1 and E2 enzymes was ruled out and structural homologues of clomipramine were analysed for Itch
inhibitory activity. ELISA= enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (B) Drugable surface of Itch and predicted Clomipramine binding sites.

irreversible manner and can affect other HECT E3s, it is
possible that it forms a covalent bond with the catalytic
cysteine found in the HECT domain [230]. Interestingly,
we have identified two other possible binding sites in
the HECT domain that may accommodate clomipramine
(Figure 4B) [230].
We have previously shown that clomipramine
interferes with autophagic flux [63] in what appears to be
unrelated to its Itch inhibitory activity. This demonstrates
the issue of polypharmacology, which adds to the
complexity of targeting specific proteins for degradation.
Even if a drug exhibits specificity towards a certain E3,
it might display a number of “off-target effects” that are
very difficult to predict. Furthermore, Itch is known to
target other proteins for ubiquitination [231] and is linked
to important cellular pathways such as Hippo [72, 226]
adding to the complexity of predicting the consequence of
Itch inhibition in vivo.
Another approach to identify HECT E3 ligase
inhibitors was taken by Yamagishi et al. [232], which
identified an N-methyl-peptide that inhibits activity of
E6AP. The group developed a technique to synthesize
a de novo library of ‘natural product like’ nonstandard
peptides and a screening technique called RaPID (random
nonstandard peptides integrated discovery), where every
peptide is linked to its respective mRNA sequence via
puromycin. Using an in vitro display technique, peptides
that bind to the E6AP HECT domain were identified
and one was further validated as an inhibitor of E6AP
E3 ligase activity in in vitro ubiquitination assays [232].
These studies are thus a proof of concept for identification
of HECT E3 ligase specific inhibitor by in vitro HTS.
Further validation and development of these and/or other
compounds will be necessary to show if HECT E3 ligase
inhibition can be exploited therapeutically in the clinic.

The success of the personalized medicine approach
depends on the availability of compounds that can hit the
identified pathway found to be important in a given patient
context. Therefore, a collection of small molecules that
can manipulate key cellular elements including E3 ligases
and transcription factors is essential. Indeed, the growing
number of specific E3 ligase inhibitors (table 1) under
development is encouraging and may lead to the first E3
ligase inhibitor approved for clinical use.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

6.	

E3 ligases are key molecules in the regulation of
protein degradation, activation and localisation and as such
are promising targets for therapeutic intervention [233].
Importantly, E3 ligases are tight regulators of transcription
factors; another class of key molecules that are known
to be deregulated in many disease types and that are
considered undrugable. Indeed, efforts are underway to
develop small molecules that target E3 ligases in order to
manipulate the activity of transcription factors. How does
one find a small molecule that will inhibit an E3 ligase?
Naturally, there are several strategies that can be adopted
although inevitably this is challenging due to the complex
nature of the ubiquitination reaction. Moreover, it is hard
to predict how a small molecule identified to block an E3
in vitro will function in vivo due to the fact that each E3
ligase is likely to ubiquitinate several different proteins.
