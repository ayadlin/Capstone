ABSTRACT
CCT245737 is the first orally active, clinical development candidate CHK1 inhibitor
to be described. The IC50 was 1.4nM against CHK1 enzyme and it exhibited>1,000fold selectivity against CHK2 and CDK1. CCT245737 potently inhibited cellular CHK1
activity (IC50 30-220nM) and enhanced gemcitabine and SN38 cytotoxicity in multiple
human tumor cell lines and human tumor xenograft models. Mouse oral bioavailability
was complete (100%) with extensive tumor exposure. Genotoxic-induced CHK1
activity (pS296 CHK1) and cell cycle arrest (pY15 CDK1) were inhibited both in vitro
and in human tumor xenografts by CCT245737, causing increased DNA damage and
apoptosis. Uniquely, we show CCT245737 enhanced gemcitabine antitumor activity
to a greater degree than for higher doses of either agent alone, without increasing
toxicity, indicating a true therapeutic advantage for this combination. Furthermore,
development of a novel ELISA assay for pS296 CHK1 autophosphorylation, allowed
the quantitative measurement of target inhibition in a RAS mutant human tumor
xenograft of NSCLC at efficacious doses of CCT245737. Finally, CCT245737 also
showed significant single-agent activity against a MYC-driven mouse model of B-cell
lymphoma. In conclusion, CCT245737 is a new CHK1 inhibitor clinical development
candidate scheduled for a first in man Phase I clinical trial, that will use the novel
pS296 CHK1 ELISA to monitor target inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

in this process is TP53 which can induce G1/S cell cycle
arrest and either DNA repair or apoptosis [4]. A hallmark
of many tumors is the lack of functional p53 protein
with a consequent loss of the G1/S checkpoint leading
to a potential increase in reliance on the S and G2/M
checkpoints for survival following genotoxic stress [5].
This has therefore stimulated the development of selective

The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway has
evolved to protect cells from genetic insults in an effort
to preserve genomic integrity and cell viability [1, 2].
Anticancer chemotherapy often includes DNA damaging
agents which activate the DDR [3]. An important gene

RESULTS

G2 checkpoint inhibitors for combination with DNA
damaging anticancer drugs [6-9] .
One potential drug target controlling this checkpoint
is the serine/threonine kinase CHK1 which has been shown
to be involved in the G1 and G2 checkpoints through
altering CDC25A stability and CDC25C localization,
respectively [3, 10, 11]. CHK1 also maintains replication
fork stability (and hence the S-phase checkpoint) and has
been implicated in facilitating homologous recombination
repair [10, 12, 13]. As a result of promising early studies,
several CHK1 inhibitors have been developed and are
currently undergoing clinical evaluation in combination
with genotoxic drugs [6, 8, 14-16].
Recent studies have also indicated that CHK1
inhibition alone may have therapeutic activity in certain
genetic backgrounds [6, 17, 18]. There is increasing
evidence that many tumors harbor substantial amounts
of DNA damage as a result of replication stress. This
process appears to be intimately associated with tumor
development and may arise as a result of oncogeneinduced increases in the firing of replication origins. As
a consequence, depletion of RPA and dNTPs results in
the accumulation of stalled replication forks [19, 20].
This in turn leads to an increased requirement for CHK1
to prevent fork collapse and DNA damage. In support of
this hypothesis, single-agent CHK1 inhibitor activity has
been demonstrated in several tumor types including MYCdriven tumors such as neuroblastoma and lymphoma
as well as acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma, all
diseases thought to be associated with high levels of
replication stress [17, 18, 21, 22] .
We have therefore discovered a novel, potent,
orally active CHK1 inhibitor and clinical development
candidate: CCT245737. Here we describe the preclinical
pharmacology and pharmacodynamics (PD) of this
compound together with its therapeutic activity in
combination with various genotoxic anticancer drugs in
multiple human tumor xenografts. Uniquely, we present
clear evidence that the combination of gemcitabine and
CCT245737 provides a substantial therapeutic advantage
over either agent alone in an antitumor context, thus
validating this approach. We describe a novel ELISA
for pS296CHK1, which demonstrated target inhibition
following CCT245737 treatment at efficacious doses with
gemcitabine and carboplatin in a RAS mutant human
tumor xenograft model of NSCLC, an area of unmet
clinical need in cancer treatment. In addition CCT245737
showed significant antitumor activity as a single-agent
in an Eµ-Myc driven mouse model of B-cell lymphoma.
Consequently CCT245737 is in late stage preclinical
development for scheduled entry into phase I clinical
trials.

Structure and kinase selectivity of CCT245737
Figure 1A shows the chemical structure of
CCT245737 ((R)-5-((4-((morpholin-2-ylmethyl)amino)5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)amino)pyrazine-2carbonitrile). A model of CCT245737 bound in the ATP
pocket of human CHK1 is shown in Supplementary
Figure S1 and suggests that key interactions in the ATP
binding site have been retained through hydrogen bonding
to Glu85 and Cys87 in the hinge region, the hydrogen
bonding of the nitrile to Lys38, while the basic nitrogen
on the morpholine forms a salt bridge to Glu91. Similar
binding poses have been observed for several other
2-amino-pyrazine-5-carbonitrile CHK1 inhibitors [23].
Initial in vitro kinase profiling of CCT245737
(10µM) against 124 kinases showed that only 12 kinases
(including CHK1) had > 80% inhibition (Supplementary
Table 1). In vitro IC50 values were determined for these
12 kinases and five others including CDK2/CycA and
CDK1/CycB (Supplementary Table 2). CCT245737
was a potent inhibitor of recombinant human CHK1
with IC50 of 1.4±0.3nM (mean±SD, n = 3, EZ Reader
II assay). There was > 1,000-fold selectivity for CHK1
versus the functionally important kinases CDK1 and
CHK2 (IC50 1.26-2.44 and 9.03 µM, respectively), and at
least a 90-fold selectivity against cross-reacting kinases
such as ERK8, PKD1, RSK1 and 2 (see Supplementary
Table 2, 33P radiometric assay); thus demonstrating that
CCT245737 is a potent and selective CHK1 inhibitor.

Cellular pharmacology of CCT245737
The ability of CCT245737 to abrogate an etoposideinduced G2 checkpoint (MIA) in four cell lines is shown
in Table 1 and IC50 values ranged from 30 to 220nM,
confirming potent cellular CHK1 inhibition. There was
a greater than 10-fold range in GI50 (0.41 to 5.4µM) for
single-agent CCT245737 in these cell lines. Cell cycle
studies (Figure 1B) showed that CCT245737 had minimal
effects in HT29 cells up to 0.5µM for 24h, but at higher
concentrations there was an apparent decrease in the
G1/Go population and a concomitant increase in the S’
population, which are unlabelled S-phase cells that may
represent a replication crisis [24]. Etoposide alone caused
a marked loss of G1/G0 and a corresponding G2/M block.
The addition of increasing concentrations of CCT245737
abrogated this G2/M block with a corresponding increase
in the S’-phase population, confirming that CCT245737
can abrogate an etoposide-induced G2/M arrest.
Previous studies have established that the
antimetabolite gemcitabine and topoisomerase 1 inhibitor
SN38 are amongst the best candidate drugs for combination

with CHK1 inhibitors [24, 25]. Table 1 confirms that in
several human tumor cell lines, CCT245737 significantly
enhanced the cytotoxicity of these two anticancer drugs
with the greatest potentiation occurring with gemcitabine
(Figure 1C). Importantly, similar studies using a more
conventional approach to determining the potentiation,
with minimally toxic concentrations of CCT245737
and a range of genotoxic drug concentrations, showed a
similar relationship (Supplementary Figure 2). However,
this conventional assay showed less potentiation and
was markedly more sensitive to variations in the CHK1
inhibitor concentration employed, which has implications
for early drug development as discussed later. There was
no statistically significant difference in cytotoxicity, MIA
or PI activity of the S-enantiomer CCT252463 compared

with CCT245737 (data not shown).
Cellular PD biomarker studies in HT29 colon
tumor cells showed that gemcitabine markedly
induced autophosphorylation of CHK1 on S296 and
phosphorylation of S280, S317 and S345 (Figure 1D).
In addition, pY15 CDK1 was increased, consistent
with a drug-induced cell cycle arrest. The addition of
≥0.5µM CCT245737 to gemcitabine caused a marked
loss of pS296 signal with complete inhibition at ≥2µM
CCT245737. Similar effects were seen on pS317 CHK1
but by contrast there was less marked or minimal
inhibition of the other CHK1 phosphorylation sites (pS280
and pS345) or alteration in the expression of total CHK1.
Loss of pY15 CDK1 corresponded exactly with loss of
pS296 CHK1, consistent with abrogation of cell cycle

checkpoint and there was a marked co-ordinate increase
in pS139 H2AX (γH2AX) a marker of DNA doublestrand breaks and cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis.
Loss of other inhibitory phosphorylations, such as pT14
CDK1 might further enhance the activity of CCT245737.
These observations imply that CCT245737 caused CHK1
inhibition, abrogated gemcitabine induced cell cycle arrest
causing DNA damage and cell death. Similar results were
obtained in the SW620 colon cancer cell line with either
gemcitabine or SN38 (Supplementary Figure 3). These
data confirm that CCT245737 can inhibit CHK1 activity
and enhance the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine and SN38 in
several human cancer cells line in vitro.

A critical step in successful drug development is
characterization of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism
of a molecule, to ensure effective tissue drug exposure
[26, 27]. Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 3 summarize
the pharmacokinetics of CCT245737 in BALB/c mice
following either i.v. or p.o. administration. An i.v. dose of
10mg/kg CCT245737 gave a peak plasma concentration
of 4µmol/L, with a half-life of 2.86h, an AUC0-∞ of
9.96µmol.h/L, a plasma clearance of 2.1L/h/kg and a
large volume of distribution (0.19L). The equivalent oral
dose gave an almost identical profile with an AUC0-∞ of

taken 24h following the last drug dose. Protein expression was measured by western blotting as described in Materials and Methods and
GAPDH was used as a loading control. Similar results were obtained at the 6h time point. D. Quantification of the pharmacodynamic effects

10.4µmol.h/L showing complete oral bioavailability (F =
105%). Plasma protein binding in nude mice was 75.6%
at 10µM CCT245737. In addition, this compound has
high cell permeability, as measured by transport across a
CaCo2 cell monolayer, with Pe = 25x10-6cm/s. Moreover,
there was no evidence of asymmetry in the permeability
with apical > basal or basal > apical across the monolayer,
indicating that the compound is not a substrate for active
efflux by PGP. CCT245737 had linear kinetics in whole

blood (Figure 2B). Consistent with the large volume of
distribution, concentrations of CCT245737 in the spleen
were 10 to 25 times greater than in the plasma for both
routes of administration and this was reflected in the
correspondingly greater AUC0-∞ (Supplementary Table
3). Similarly high tumor/plasma ratios were obtained in
HT29 xenografts treated with a fixed dose of gemcitabine
and different doses of CCT245737 (Supplementary
Figure 4). Moreover, 24h following a dose of 12.5mg/kg

p.o. CCT245737, mean tumor drug concentrations were
≥ 3µmol/L, a value that would be expected to markedly
inhibit cellular CHK1 kinase activity (see MIA IC50 Table
1) and gave significant antitumor activity (Supplementary
Table 4).
An in vivo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) study in HT29 tumor xenografts taken from mice
administered gemcitabine followed by CCT245737 is
shown in Figure 2C and 2D. Gemcitabine alone (100mg/
kg i.v.) caused marked pS296 CHK1 induction along
with pS317 CHK1 and pY15 CDK1. The addition of
CCT245737 at 50 or 100mg/kg p.o. significantly reduced
the pS296 signal and pY15 CDK1 at the higher dose (P
< 0.05, Figure 2D) but not pS317, consistent with CHK1
inhibition in vivo and the in vitro cellular data (see Figure
1D, Supplementary Figure 3). These PK-PD studies show

that following oral administration, for a range of drug
doses, adequate CCT245737 tumor drug exposure for
durable CHK1 inhibition can be achieved.

Therapeutic activity of CCT245737 combinations
in human tumor xenografts
Extensive antitumor studies were carried out using
gemcitabine and different doses of CCT245737 in HT29
human colon tumor xenografts (Figure 3A, 3B and
Supplementary Table 4). Figure 3A shows that CCT245737
(150mg/kg p.o.) or gemcitabine alone (100mg/kg i.v.) had
minimal antitumor activity with growth delays of 0.3±3.4
and -0.6±2.7 days, respectively (mean±SD, Supplementary
Table 4). However, the addition of CCT245737 (150mg/
kg p.o.) significantly increased the antitumor activity

of gemcitabine giving a growth delay of 19.3±1.7 days
(mean±SD, P < 0.001, Supplementary Table 4). This
enhancement was associated with no body weight loss in
drug treated animals (Supplementary Figure 5A). Figure
3B and Supplementary Table 4 show the effect of different
doses of CCT245737 up to a maximum of 150mg/kg p.o.
on the antitumor effects of a fixed dose of gemcitabine
(100mg/kg i.v.) in HT29 xenografts. As expected there
appears to be a saturable effect of CCT245737 dose on
antitumor activity with the greatest effect occurring
at around 100mg/kg p.o. At doses up to 50mg/kg p.o.
CCT245737 there was a steep increase in the effects of
this CHK1 inhibitor on the tumor growth delay response to
gemcitabine indicating that low doses of CCT245737 may
still have marked therapeutic activity in this combination.
These treatments were minimally toxic with a body
weight nadir on day 16 and only 2.5% weight loss in the
combination arm (Supplementary Figures 5B & 5C). In
addition, there was no antitumor effect of CCT245737
alone at the combination maximum tolerated dose (MTD,
150mg/kg p.o.) and only a small increase in antitumor
activity of gemcitabine alone at the MTD of 200mg/
kg i.v. from 3 to 6 days (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Table 4). Importantly, these results clearly show that the
combination of CCT245737 with gemcitabine can readily
achieve much greater antitumor activity than either agent
alone at their respective MTDs. Moreover there was no
increase in toxicity thus validating the therapeutic utility
of CHK1 inhibitors in vivo.
These antitumor studies with CCT245737 were
extended into combinations employing other anticancer
drugs such as irinotecan in the colon cancer HT29
xenograft model (Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 5).
Once again there was no antitumor activity of CCT245737
alone at the combination MTD (1.0±1.0 days growth delay,
mean±SD), however, irinotecan had substantial antitumor
activity alone at the dose employed with a growth delay
of 6.2±4.6 days (mean±SD, n = 6). Nevertheless the
addition of CCT245737 doubled the growth delay induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by irinotecan to 12.4 days (P < 0.05) with a body weight
nadir on day 10 of only 2% loss (Supplementary Figure
5D). Studies in SW620 colon cancer xenografts (Figure
3D) showed that CCT245737 and gemcitabine were
minimally active as single agents and the combination
showed a significantly enhanced antitumor activity
compared with gemcitabine alone (7.3±2.1 versus1.5±2.3
days growth delay, P < 0.001, Supplementary Table 5)
with minimal toxicity (4.3% body weight loss on day 9,
Supplementary Figure 5E). These results demonstrate
that CCT245737 can significantly enhance the antitumor
activity of irinotecan and gemcitabine in a number of
different human tumor xenograft models. Furthermore,
when tested in HT29 tumors, the activity of gemcitabine
combined with CCT245737 was greater than could be
achieved at the MTD of either agent alone.

A novel, quantitative and sensitive biomarker
assay for CHK1 activity
CCT245737 may be evaluated in several clinical
settings, including solid tumors treated with genotoxic
drugs, such as lung cancers. This will require a validated
assay for a suitable PD biomarker to confirm that CHK1
inhibition has occurred. We therefore developed an ELISA
for measuring S296 CHK1 autophosphorylation (pS296)
in human tumor material as this is the most sensitive and
specific proximal biomarker of CHK1 kinase activity
(see Materials and Methods for details). Figure 4A shows
that CCT245737 alone or gemcitabine plus carboplatin
combined (a standard treatment for lung cancer) had
minimal antitumor activity in the Calu6 RAS mutant
NSCLC human tumor xenograft model (Supplementary
Table 5). The addition of CCT245737 to the genotoxic
agents resulted in a statistically significant 9 day increase
in tumor growth delay (Supplementary Table 5, P <
0.001) with minimal weight loss (nadir on day 3 = 2%,
Supplementary Figure 5F). Western blotting for PD

biomarker changes in Calu6 xenograft tumors taken from
individual mice (Figure 4B) showed that the combination
of gemcitabine and carboplatin markedly induced pS296
CHK1 but had minimal effects on pS317 and pS345
CHK1 signals, consistent with our previous studies (Figure
1D [24, 28]). The addition of CCT245737 completely
abolished the pS296 signal but actually enhanced both
pS317 and pS345 CHK1 levels - confirming once again
that pS296CHK1 is a sensitive, robust and reproducible
biomarker of CHK1 inhibition. There were minimal
changes in total CHK1 expression. Using the same Calu6
tumor lysates from these studies we show that the ELISA
assay for pS296 CHK1 accurately reproduced this signal
as detected by western blotting (Figure 4C). In addition
the ELISA for total CHK1 showed minimal changes
consistent with the immunoblotting results (Figure 4D).

Both assays were capable of detecting recombinant
pS296 and total CHK1 down to a concentration of 0.4nM
(assuming a signal:noise ratio of 2:1). These results show
that we have developed an accurate and sensitive ELISA
for pS296 CHK1, a biomarker of CHK1 activity, which
can be quantified in human tumor tissue.

Single-agent antitumor activity of CCT245737
in an Eµ-Myc driven mouse model of B-cell
lymphoma
The deregulation of certain oncogenes such as
MYCN in neuroblastoma and C-MYC in lymphoma
appears to be associated with an increase in single-agent
CHK1 sensitivity, possibly through enhanced replication

stress. We therefore evaluated the antitumor activity
of CCT245737 in an Eµ-Myc driven transgenic mouse
transplant model of B-cell lymphoma that infiltrates the
lymph glands. Figure 5A clearly shows that 9 days oral
administration of 150mg/kg CCT245737 significantly
reduced the weight of the inguinal, brachial/axillary and
mesenteric lymph nodes compared with vehicle treated
control animals (P < 0.05). Moreover there were minimal
effects on normal tissues such as the lung (Figure 5B, p =
0.904) and bone marrow (Figure 5C, p = 0.0838) or kidney
(p = 0.959, not shown). There was a significant decrease
in thymus weight following CCT245737 treatment (p <
0.01) suggesting some tumor involvement and spleen
weight was increased significantly (p < 0.01) suggesting
some splenomegaly (not shown). The treatment was well
tolerated as evidenced by stable body weights (Figure 5D)
and negligible effects on other parameters such as water
consumption and body temperature (data not shown).
Consequently these results show that CCT245737 has
significant antitumor activity as an oral single-agent in a
Myc-driven mouse model of B-cell lymphoma.

that the cytotoxicity of both gemcitabine and SN38 were
significantly enhanced (Table 1). This technique was
validated by comparison with the more conventional
approach where a non-toxic concentration of a CHK1
inhibitor is combined with increasing concentrations
of the genotoxic drug (Supplementary Figure 3) with
qualitatively similar results. The rapid technique presented
here has the advantage of quickly establishing a genotoxic
GI50 in contrast to the most active non-toxic CHK1
inhibitor concentration. Moreover, this rapid technique
was more sensitive than the conventional approach with
2 to 3-fold greater PI values, allowing evaluation and
ranking of relatively non-potent and selective compounds
in the early stages of the CHK1 inhibitor drug discovery
project.
It is clear from these and other available data that
antimetabolites such as gemcitabine are potentiated
by several CHK1 inhibitors to a greater extent than
topoisomerase 1 inhibitors [24, 25, 35]. This may reflect
a greater ability of the former to deplete nucleotide pools
and enhance replication stress with an increased reliance
on CHK1 to avoid replication fork collapse [36, 37].
Our cellular PD biomarker studies reproducibly showed
that there was a concentration-dependent inhibition of
genotoxic induced pS296 CHK1 autophosphorylation
by CCT245737. Moreover this pS296 CHK1 signal was
a more sensitive and robust readout of CHK1 inhibition
in our systems than other phospho-CHK1 sites. This is in
contrast to other reports [38], possibly due to the fact that
pS296 is a specific and direct readout of CHK1 activity
[39], an essential requirement for PD biomarkers of kinase
inhibitors. This CCT245737 concentration-dependent
loss of pS296 CHK1 signal was coincident with loss of
cell cycle arrest, increased DNA damage and apoptosis
implying that CHK1 inhibition induced cell death [3, 40].
Pharmacokinetic studies with CCT245737 showed
complete oral bioavailability with linear pharmacokinetics
and high tumor/plasma ratios consistent with extensive
tumor exposure. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that
CCT245737 concentrations required for inhibition of
gemcitabine-induced pS296 CHK1 and pY15 CDK1 were
readily achieved in tumors at 24h following a single oral
dose of 50mg/kg (Figure 2C). We and others have shown
that an effective antitumor combination strategy involves
delaying CHK1 inhibitor administration by 24h following
a genotoxic drug dose and then extending effective CHK1
exposure for a further 48h [7, 24, 35]. Moreover there
were no detectable pharmacokinetic interactions with
this CHK1 inhibitor chemical class and the genotoxic
agents studied. The PK-PD relationship described here for
CCT245737 and its high oral bioavailability, make this an
ideal compound for clinical evaluation. `
Efficacy studies in a number of different xenograft
tumor models showed that CCT245737 enhanced the
activity of both gemcitabine and irinotecan. Importantly
and uniquely, we show for the first time that a CHK1

DISCUSSION
CCT245737 is a novel, potent, selective and welltolerated orally active CHK1 inhibitor, and our clinical
development candidate. Enzyme kinetic and modeling
data clearly show that CCT245737 is a potent, ATPcompetitive inhibitor of human CHK1 kinase with an
IC50 of 1.4nM. Initial screening against other kinases
demonstrated an appropriate selectivity profile with
subsequent studies showing ≥ 500-fold selectivity for
all but five kinases. Importantly there was minimal
inhibition of CHK2 which has little therapeutic utility in
genotoxic combinations [29, 30]. There was also no crossreactivity with CDK1 and 2, inhibition of which might
antagonize the cytotoxic effects of CHK1 inhibition, as
CDK1 activation has been implicated in CHK1 inhibitorbased cell killing [30]. This selectivity profile compares
favorably with other CHK1 inhibitors, such as AZD7762
[31], GDC-0575 [32], PF00477736 [33] and LY2603618
[34]. There was evidence of potent intracellular CHK1
inhibition in several human tumor cell lines following
genotoxic stress (Table 1) and this was associated with
abrogation of a late S, G2/M checkpoint (Figure 1C)
consistent with CHK1 inhibition and similar to other
CHK1 inhibitors [28, 33] . Several previous studies have
established that certain classes of genotoxic anticancer
drugs are potentiated more effectively than others by
CHK1 inhibitors e.g. antimetabolites and topoisomerase
1 inhibitors [25, 35].
Using a rapid and sensitive assay for determining
the combination GI50 (where a fixed concentration of the
genotoxic agent is combined with a range of CCT245737
concentrations) we derived a potentiation index (ratio of
IC50 for CCT245737 alone: combination GI50) and showed

inhibitor can markedly enhance the antitumor activity of
gemcitabine to a greater extent than can be achieved by the
MTD of either agent alone. Moreover the dose-response
curve had a relatively steep initial phase, suggesting
that a therapeutically useful increase in gemcitabine
activity is feasible at modest doses of CCT245737, as
might be achieved in early stage clinical trials. This
response appeared to plateau at doses above 50mg/kg,
implying that very high concentrations of CCT245737
may not be required for optimal therapeutic activity and
consistent with the idea that CHK1 inhibition in tumors
may enhance DNA damage or stalled replication fork
collapse [8, 13]. These observations further support the
clinical development and evaluation of CCT245737 in
combination with genotoxic agents such as gemcitabine.
To this end we have shown that CCT245737 can
significantly enhance the antitumor activity of both
gemcitabine and carboplatin in a RAS mutant NSCLC
human tumor xenograft model. This is an area of unmet
clinical need and a disease setting in which clinical
testing of CCT245737 is proposed. In order to ensure that
these antitumor effects are a result of CHK1 inhibition
we also carried out PD studies and showed once again
that pS296 CHK1 inhibition is a more sensitive, robust
and reproducible marker of CHK1 inhibition than either
pS317 or pS345 CHK1. Indeed, induction/inhibition of
pS317 and pS345 CHK1 by CCT245737 appeared to be
either concentration and/or time dependent (Figure 1D
and Supplementary Figure 3) as well as context dependent
(Figure 2C and 4B) possibly through differences in
feedback repression of ATR/ATM, DNA damage and
repair capacity or PP2A and WIP1 phosphatase activity.
Consequently we developed a novel, sensitive and
quantitative ELISA for pS296 CHK1 which will facilitate
the clinical evaluation of this combination and allow
target inhibition monitoring in the patient. Nevertheless
other indirect readouts such as CDC25A or pY15 CDK1
loss, apoptosis markers and γH2AX and RAD51 foci
formation may prove useful in confirming that functionally
significant CHK1 inhibition has occurred [8, 24, 41, 42].
An intriguing aspect of CHK1 inhibitor development
is the realization that these compounds may exhibit singleagent activity in particular malignancies. It appears that
tumors with deregulated MYC expression or high levels of
replication stress are very sensitive to single-agent CHK1
inhibition [17, 18, 21, 22]. To expand the potential clinical
utility of CCT245737 monotherapy we have shown that
it has significant antitumor activity in an Eµ-Myc driven
transgenic murine model of infiltrating B-cell lymphoma
(Burkitt’s-type lymphoma) [43]. MYC gene alterations
are common in other B-cell neoplasms and are often
associated with poor outcomes [44]. CCT245737 as a
single-agent was well tolerated in the Eµ-Myc transgenic
model and had minimal effects on normal tissues such as
lung and bone marrow and kidney, although there was
some evidence of splenomegaly. However the use of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an isogenic MYC inducible model would be even more
definitive. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with
studies using the CHK1 inhibitor PF-0477736 in a variety
of Eµ-Myc driven transgenic murine lymphoma cell lines
[18] and are directly comparable with antitumor studies
using UCN01 (5mg/kg x 9 days), a non-selective CHK1
inhibitor in the same model [45]. In the latter case clear
evidence of tumor growth inhibition was associated with
a decreased blood cell count, possibly due to off-target
effects of UCN01 and in marked contrast to this study.
Should CHK1 inhibitors prove successful in the clinic it
will be important to identify biomarkers of sensitivity to
facilitate patient selection and to establish other molecular
targets, which upon inhibition give a synthetically lethal
phenotype [46].
In conclusion, we have investigated the preclinical
pharmacology, PK-PD relationships and antitumor
activity of the novel, potent, selective and orally active
CHK1 clinical development candidate CCT245737. We
clearly show that CCT245737 enhanced the antitumor
activity of several anticancer agents in vivo and uniquely
demonstrate that for gemcitabine this was greater than
the activity achievable by dose escalation of either agent
alone. The lack of additional toxicity in the combinations
thus provides a valuable therapeutic gain. We also show
that pS296 CHK1 is a robust PD biomarker of CHK1
activity and provide a novel, quantitative ELISA-based
assay suitable for the measurement of this biomarker in
clinical material. We demonstrate that CCT245737 has
single-agent antitumor activity in a Myc driven model
of B-cell lymphoma, providing preclinical evidence of a
potential adult clinical monotherapy setting. Consequently
CCT245737 is in late stage preclinical development in
preparation for a first-in-man phase I clinical trial.

http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic).
Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium
containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2mM glutamine and
were mycoplasma free [24].

Western blotting was carried out as described
[24]. ELISA assays for pS296 CHK1 and total CHK1
were developed and validated for use in vitro and in
tumor homogenates. Tumor samples for ELISA and
western blotting were lysed in CHAPS buffer (1%
CHAPS in 150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1mM
EDTA, 0.2mM PMSF and 1:50 Sigma Phosphatase
inhibitors 2 and 3 and 1:100 Sigma protease cocktail)
and immunoblotted. ELISA assays were based on
commercially available kits with modifications (Cell
Signalling Technologies). For pS296 CHK1 detection the
commercial pS317 CHK1 antibody was replaced with
a pS296 CHK1 antibody (Cell Signalling Technology).
Xenograft tumor homogenate was added in duplicate
to 96 well plates (100µl containing 40ug protein) and
quantification of the colorimetric readout was determined
at 450nm using a PerkinElmer 2103 EnVision Multilabel
plate reader.

In vitro kinase assays
Commercial in vitro 33P radiometric kinase assays
were carried out against 124 human kinases using 10µM
CCT245737 at ATP concentrations corresponding to the
kinase Km,ATP (MRC Phosphorylation Unit, Dundee).
Other kinase IC50 determinations for CHK2 and FLT3
were performed using a commercial assay (Z’-Lyte,
Invitrogen) or in-house with recombinant human CHK1
on a LabChip® EZ Reader II (PerkinElmer) or CDK1 in a
DELFIA assay (PerkinElmer).

Cellular cytotoxicity, G2 checkpoint abrogation
and potentiation assays

Cell cycle analysis

Assays were performed as described [24].
Cytotoxicity was determined as the drug concentration
that gave 50% inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (GI50)
using a 96h (i.e. 4-doublings) Sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assay. Inhibition of intracellular CHK1 activity was
measured using a cell based ELISA for the abrogation of
an etoposide induced G2 checkpoint (mitosis induction
assay, MIA [24]). The IC50 for G2 checkpoint abrogation
(MIA) was determined in the presence of nocodazole
using UCN01 as a positive control. The activity index
(AI) was used as a measure of the compounds ability to
induce mitosis relative to its toxicity (i.e., ratio of MIA
IC50: 96h SRB GI50). Routine potentiation studies were
carried out using a fixed concentration (GI50) of either
gemcitabine or SN38 in combination with a range of
CCT245737 concentrations to determine the combination
GI50 of CCT245737. The ability of CCT245737 to
enhance gemcitabine or SN38 cell killing was expressed
as a potentiation index (PI) equal to the ratio of the
GI50 for CCT245737 alone versus the combination GI50
for CCT245737 (see above). PI values > 1 indicate
potentiation of the genotoxic activity. In addition, a
series of experiments was carried out using fixed, nonor minimally toxic concentrations of CCT245737
(≤GI20) with a range of different concentrations of
gemcitabine or SN38 to determine the extent to which
CCT245737 enhanced drug cytotoxicity compared with
the genotoxic agent alone, i.e. conventional PI (ratio GI50
genotoxic alone: GI50 genotoxic combined with non-toxic
CCT245737 concentration, Con PI).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide and
bromodeoxyuridine staining was as described [28].

Animal studies
Compound tolerability and pharmacokinetic
investigations were carried out in female BALB/c mice
(Charles River). Human tumor xenografts were established
s.c. in female CRTac:Ncr-Fox1(nu) athymic mice and
treated as previously described [24, 28]. The vehicle for
oral administration of CCT245737 was DPTW (10%
DMSO, 20% PEG400, 5% Tween 80 and 65% water) and
gemcitabine and irinotecan were administered in their
respective clinical vehicles. Treatments were generally
initiated when tumors reached a mean diameter of 5-6mm
(day 0). For combination studies, CCT245737 was given
orally 24 and 48h after genotoxic drug administration,
previously determined as an optimal schedule for CHK1
inhibitor and genotoxic drug combinations [24]. In
HT29 xenograft studies, gemcitabine was administered
at 100mg/kg i.v. on days 0,7 and 14 and CCT245737 at
the indicated doses on days 1,2,8,9,15 and16. Irinotecan
was administered at 25mg/kg i.p. on days 0,4 and 8 with
CCT245737 administered at 150mg/kg p.o. on days
1,2,5,6,9 and 10. In SW620 and Calu6 xenograft studies,
gemcitabine was administered at 100mg/kg i.v. on days 0,4
and 8 and CCT245737 subsequently at 150mg/kg on days
1,2,5,6,9 and 10. For the Calu6 xenograft studies involving
gemcitabine and carboplatin, drugs were administered
at 100mg/kg i.v. and 5mg/kg i.p., respectively on day 0
with gemcitabine alone at 100mg/kg i.v. on day 7 with

CCT245737 at 150mg/kg p.o. on days 1,2,8 and 9. The
genotoxic drug doses employed were sub-maximally
active to facilitate detection of subsequent potentiation.
Initial treatment groups contained from 6 to 10 mice and
animals were inspected daily and tumor size and volume
measured every 2 or 3 days. Tumor volume and growth
delay were determined as previously described [28].
Transgenic Eµ-Myc mice which develop aggressive
infiltrating lymphoma were established and monitored
as previously described [48, 49]. To generate transgenic
Eµ-Myc driven lymphoma allografts, tumor cells from 3
separate tumors were harvested, cells counted and injected
via a tail vein. Six mice were set up per tumor to provide
3 control and 3 treated animals, giving a maximum of
9 mice per treatment group. Animals were monitored
daily and continuously using RFID transponders to
measure temperature, activity and water consumption
as previously described [49]. For studies of single-agent
CCT245737 activity in mice injected with transgenic EµMyc lymphoid tumor cells, CCT245737 was administered
at 150mg/kg p.o. for 9 successive days with culling 24h
after the last dose. Lymph nodes and other tissues were
removed from vehicle and CCT245737 treated mice and
their weights and tissue/body weight ratios compared to
assess antitumor activity. Bone marrow cellularity was
also determined to check for tumor cell involvement. All
mice were handled in compliance with local and national
animal welfare guidelines [50].
