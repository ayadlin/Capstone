Abstract
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which regulates the functions of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways, has
emerged as a novel anticancer therapeutic target, and multiple small-molecule HSP90 inhibitors are now in
clinical trials. Although the effects of HSP90 inhibitors on oncogenic signaling pathways have been extensively
studied, the effects of these agents on tumor suppressor signaling pathways are currently unknown. Here, we
have examined how HSP90 inhibitors affect LATS1 and the related protein LATS2, two kinases that relay antiproliferative signals in the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Both LATS1 and LATS2 were depleted from cells
treated with the HSP90 inhibitors 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), radicicol, and PU-H71.
Moreover, these kinases interacted with HSP90, and LATS1 isolated from 17-AAG–treated cells had reduced
catalytic activity, thus showing that the kinase is a bona fide HSP90 client. Importantly, LATS1 signaling was
disrupted by 17-AAG in tumor cell lines in vitro and clinical ovarian cancers in vivo as shown by reduced levels
of LATS1 and decreased phosphorylation of the LATS substrate YAP, an oncoprotein transcriptional coactivator that regulates genes involved in cell and tissue growth, including the CTGF gene. Consistent with the
reduced YAP phosphorylation, there were increased levels of CTGF, a secreted protein that is implicated in
tumor proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Taken together, these results identify LATS1 and LATS2 as
novel HSP90 clients and show that HSP90 inhibitors can disrupt the LATS tumor suppressor pathway in
human cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8642–50. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Heat shock protein (HSP90) is a central participant in a
multistep chaperoning process that folds and stabilizes a
wide range of cellular clients. Tumor cells express high levels
of HSP90 and have increased reliance on the HSP90 chaperoning pathway compared with normal cells (1). This increased reliance on HSP90 has been attributed to several
features of tumor cells. On the one hand, HSP90 plays critical
roles in facilitating the survival and proliferation of tumors
by chaperoning and supporting the activities of a multitude
of key oncogenic proteins that promote tumorigenesis. These
include wild-type and mutant receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g.,
epidermal growth factor receptor family members, FLT-3,

and BCR-ABL and NPM-ALK fusion proteins), signal-relaying
serine-threonine kinases (AKT, Raf isoforms, Chk1, and
cyclin-dependent kinase 4), transcription factors (HIF-1α,
steroid receptors, and mutant p53), telomerase, and proteins
involved in apoptosis (Apaf-1, Bcl-2). In addition, HSP90
helps tumors survive the stressful environmental conditions
associated with tumor proliferation. As a result, HSP90 has
attracted considerable attention as a potential cancer therapy target, and multiple HSP90 inhibitors are now in clinical
trials worldwide (2).
Despite the intense interest in oncoprotein clients that are
disabled by HSP90 inhibition, and the potential of HSP90 inhibitors to treat malignancies, the effects of these inhibitors
on tumor suppressor pathways have been largely unexplored.
Given that HSP90 inhibition of tumor suppressor pathways
may negatively affect the effectiveness of HSP90 inhibitors,
here we have examined the effects of HSP90 inhibition on
the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which was first discovered to control organ size in Drosophila by regulating proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis (3, 4). Central regulators
of this pathway in mammals are the LATS1 and LATS2 kinases (known as Warts in Drosophila), which are members
of the nuclear Dbf-2–related (NDR) serine-threonine kinase
family. LATS1 and LATS2, which are activated by cell-cell
contact, negatively regulate cell proliferation and organ size
in mice (5, 6). The activation states of LATS1 and LATS2 are

LATS1 and LATS2 are Heat Shock Protein 90 Clients

regulated by the serine-threonine kinases MST1/2 (Hippo in
Drosophila), which directly phosphorylate LATS, and by MOB
(Mats in Drosophila) family members, small proteins that
bind and activate LATS. Once activated, LATS kinases phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (7).
Phosphorylation of these transcription factors creates binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins, which localize and anchor YAP/
TAZ in the cytoplasm, and direct YAP for proteolytic degradation. In the absence of this inhibitory phosphorylation,
these transcription factors enter the nucleus, where they interact with DNA-binding proteins, including those in the
TEAD family (8, 9), to trigger the transcription of genes that
promote cell proliferation.
Consistent with their roles in cell proliferation, the central
players in this pathway have emerged as key regulators of
tumorigenesis. Lats1−/− mice develop ovarian cancers and
sarcomas (10), and the LATS1 and/or LATS2 promoters are
hypermethylated in multiple human tumor types, including
breast cancer, astrocytomas, and sarcomas (11–14), with promoter hypermethylation corresponding to reduced mRNA
expression and, in some instances, worse clinical outcome.
In addition, there is loss of heterozygosity at the LATS1
and LATS2 loci in ovarian, cervical, and breast cancer (15–
18). Similarly, MST1 and MST2 are also tumor suppressors.
Simultaneous genetic ablation of Mst1 and Mst2 in the liver
of mice leads to stem cell accumulation, liver enlargement,
and the rapid development of hepatocellular carcinomas
(19–21). In humans, the MST1 and MST2 promoters are hypermethylated in some tumors (22, 23). Collectively, these
studies suggest that MST1/2 and LATS kinases are mammalian tumor suppressors.
In contrast, YAP is an oncogene. The human YAP locus
(11q22) is amplified in multiple tumor types (24–28), and
YAP is overexpressed in many tumors (6, 29, 30). Moreover,
enforced YAP overexpression in the livers of transgenic
mice causes rapid and dramatic increases in cell proliferation, organ size, cellular dysplasia, and the development of
liver tumors (5, 6). Consistent with the findings in mice,
YAP and TAZ overexpression in nontransformed human cell
lines induces multiple hallmarks of transformation, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, decreased
apoptosis, and anchorage-independent and growth factor–
independent proliferation (30–33). Given the pivotal role
that the LATS-YAP pathway plays in cellular and organ homeostasis, the potential effects of HSP90 inhibitors on this
pathway may be relevant to the development of these
agents as anticancer agents.

Materials and Methods

cycle analyses
The human cell lines A549, MCF10A, H460, HCT-116,
U2OS, and OVCAR5 were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Every 3 months, cell lines were
re-initiated from cryopreserved stocks prepared immediately after receipt from ATCC. All cells were grown in RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), except

Cruz Biotechnology; AKT1 from Cell Signaling Technology;
MST2 from Epitomics; FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
IgG from Jackson Immunoresearch; and FLAG M2 from
Sigma-Aldrich. Murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes
HSP90β (H9010) was a kind gift from David Toft (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN).
Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,
10 mmol/L NaF, 30 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L 2-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/mL
leupeptin, 5 μg/mL aprotinin, 5 μg/mL pepstatin, 20 nmol/L
microcystin-LR, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For HSP90-LATS1 coimmunoprecipitation studies, cells
were lysed on ice in 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mmol/L
Na 2 MoO 4 , and equal amounts of soluble protein from
cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with
anti-LATS1 antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose
at 4°C. Washed immunoprecipitates were mixed with SDSPAGE sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 10 minutes, separated
by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore)
before immunoblotting.
In vitro kinase assays
A549 were transiently transfected with plasmids that express SFB-LATS1 and the indicated tagged proteins. Fortyeight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and
SFB-LATS1 was purified from the lysates by binding to
streptavidin-agarose for 1 to 3 hours with rotation at
4°C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer,
followed by three washes with kinase buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L potassium acetate, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L DTT]. Kinase reactions were initiated
by the addition of 1 μg glutathione S-transferase (GST)-YAP
(produced in Escherichia coli by standard methods), 10 μCi
(γ32P)-ATP, and 100 μmol/L unlabeled ATP to the washed
beads. The reactions were incubated for 15 minutes at 30°C,

appropriate restriction endonuclease sites. After digestion
with restriction endonucleases, the PCR fragments were ligated into the appropriate vectors to create pSFB-LATS1
(which appends an N terminal S-tag, a tandem FLAG epitope
tag, and the streptavidin-binding peptide; ref. 35), pcDNA3MST2-HA (which appends a C-terminal HA tag), pcDNA3FLAG-MOB1B (which appends an N-terminal FLAG epitope

tumors, which will be reported elsewhere. Paired core needle
biopsies were obtained before treatment and 22 to 26 hours
after patients received 154 mg/m2 17-AAG i.v. as a 2-hour infusion. Biopsy samples were immediately frozen on dry ice
and processed as described previously (36).

Results
LATS1 and LATS2, but not MST2, are depleted
by 17-AAG
HSP90 inhibition causes the depletion of HSP90 clients by
disrupting client chaperoning and targeting the clients for
proteasomal degradation. Thus, treatment of cells with an
HSP90 inhibitor provides a rapid and simple assay to assess
whether a given protein depends either directly or indirectly
on HSP90 chaperoning activity. To evaluate whether components of the LATS signaling pathway require HSP90, we
treated subconfluent A549 cancer cells with 17-AAG and examined the levels of LATS1, LATS2, and MST2 at various
time points after treatment with 1 μmol/L 17-AAG, a concentration that maximally inhibits HSP90 in many cell lines
(34, 37, 38). Whereas MST2 levels changed little over the
48-hour time course (Fig. 1A), both LATS1 and LATS2 were
depleted at rates similar to the rates at which Chk1 and
AKT, two bona fide HSP90 clients (34, 39–41), decreased.
Similar effects on LATS1 and LATS2 were also observed
when HeLa cells (data not shown) and MCF10A cells
(Fig. 1A), a nontransformed breast cell line, were treated
with 17-AAG for various times. Additional studies confirmed that a concentration of 1 μmol/L 17-AAG was maximally effective in depleting LATS1 and LATS2 in A549 and

MCF10A cells (Fig. 1B), and that the LATS kinases were depleted by the same concentrations of 17-AAG that result in Chk1
loss. To confirm that the effects of 17-AAG were due to HSP90
inhibition, we also showed that radicicol (Fig. 1C), a structurally unrelated HSP90 inhibitor (42), and PU-H71 (Fig. 1D), a
metabolically stable purine-scaffold HSP90 inhibitor (43), depleted LATS1 and LATS2. Taken together, these results
showed that the levels of LATS1 and LATS2, but not MST2,
are dramatically reduced in both transformed and untransformed human cell lines by HSP90 inhibitors.
LATS1 and LATS2 are HSP90 clients
Because HSP90 inhibitors cause cell cycle arrest in G1 and
G2-M (38, 44), it was possible that the effects seen in Fig. 1
were due to perturbations in the cell cycle, which might affect LATS1 and LATS2 levels. We assessed this possibility by
arresting subconfluent A549 cells at the G1-S border with hydroxyurea for 24 hours (Fig. 2A) and then treating them with
17-AAG for increasing times while in the continued presence
of hydroxyurea. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, 17-AAG did not
relieve the cell arrest caused by hydroxyurea, and yet both
LATS1 and LATS2 were depleted by 17-AAG in the hydroxyurea-arrested cells, indicating that the effects of 17-AAG on
LATS1 and LATS2 levels are not the result of cell cycle perturbations and suggesting that the LATS kinases might be HSP90
clients. In accord with that prediction, we found that LATS2
(Fig. 2C) and LATS1 (Fig. 2D) immunoprecipitates contained
HSP90. Furthermore, the interaction between LATS1 and
HSP90 was disrupted by 17-AAG (Fig. 2D), as has been observed with other HSP90 clients (34). Taken together, these
results show that these kinases are novel HSP90 clients.

Figure 2. LATS1 is an HSP90 client. A and B,
subconfluent A549 cells were treated with
vehicle or 10 mmol/L hydroxyurea (HU) for
24 hours to induce arrest at the G1-S phase
border. The HU-arrested cells were then
incubated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or
1 μmol/L 17-AAG in the continued presence of
HU for the indicated times. After treatment, the
cell samples were divided; one portion was
used to assess cycle by staining the DNA with
propidium iodide (A), and the remaining cells
were lysed and immunoblotted for the indicated
antigens (B). C and D, A549 cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated (IP) with nonreactive rabbit
serum (NRS) or anti-LATS2 rabbit antiserum
(C); or subconfluent A549 cells were treated
with vehicle (−) or 1 μmol/L 17-AAG (+) for
24 hours, and cell lysates were then
immunoprecipitated with NRS or anti-LATS1
rabbit antiserum (D). The immunoprecipitates
were then washed and sequentially
immunoblotted (IB) for HSP90β, and LATS1 or
LATS2. Cell lysates were immunoblotted to
show equal amounts of HSP90β in all lysates.

fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred
to a membrane. After membrane-bound
radioactivity was detected and quantitated by
phosphorimaging, the membrane was blotted
with anti-FLAG antibody to detect precipitated

transiently transfected by electroporation with EV
or plasmids that express SFB-LATS1,
FLAG-MST2, and FLAG-MOB1B as indicated.
After electroporation, cells were replated at low
density, cultured for 24 hours, and treated
with 1 μmol/L 17-AAG for the indicated times.
Cells lysates were immunoblotted with
anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies, which detect
FLAG-tagged LATS1, MST2, and MOB1B.

HSP90 inhibition reduces LATS1 catalytic activity
We also assessed how LATS1 kinase activity was affected
by HSP90 inhibition. We first attempted to assess the activity of endogenous LATS1 in subconfluent and confluent
A549 cells; however, we were unable to detect LATS1 kinase
activity with in vitro kinase assays with the use of immunopurified LATS1 (data not shown). As an alternative approach, cells were transfected with SFB-tagged LATS1
alone or with the LATS activators MST2 and MOB1B.
MST2 is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates
LATS1 on a C-terminal hydrophobic motif required for
LATS1 activation, and MOB1 is a small protein that
binds LATS1 and increases LATS1 kinase activity by inducing autophosphorylation of the LATS1 activation loop in the
catalytic domain (45). After treatment of the cells with vehicle
or 17-AAG, the SFB-tagged LATS1 was purified with the use
of streptavidin-agarose, and the activity of the bead-bound
LATS1 was assessed with the use of GST-YAP as a substrate. In the absence of coexpressed MOB1B and MST2,
LATS1 kinase activity was not above background levels

8646

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

(Fig. 3A), whereas the coexpression of MOB1B and MST2
dramatically activated LATS1, consistent with previous findings. Surprisingly, however, although 17-AAG caused reductions in LATS1 autokinase activity and YAP phosphorylation
(Fig. 3A and B), LATS1 levels did not decrease with drug
treatment. One possible explanation for this result is that
the high-level expression of MOB1B and/or MST2 stabilized
LATS1 in these experiments. To assess this possibility, we
tested how MST2 alone, MOB1B alone, and the combination of MST2 and MOB1B affected the stability of LATS1
in cells treated with 17-AAG. Whereas MST2 alone had little
effect on LATS1 stability in response to 17-AAG, MOB1B
strongly stabilized LATS1 (Fig. 3C). Similarly, and consistent
with our in vitro kinase results, coexpression of both MST2
and MOB1B further stabilized LATS1 in 17-AAG–treated
cells. These results indicate that even when LATS1 is stabilized by MOB1B and MST2, LATS1 catalytic activity is reduced in 17-AAG–treated cells, suggesting that the LATS1
kinase retains a dependence on HSP90 even when stabilized
by its physiologic activators.

17-AAG reduces the phosphorylation of YAP, a
physiologic LATS substrate, and induces the
accumulation of CTGF, a YAP target gene
in cell lines and human tumors
The findings presented above show that HSP90 inhibition
depletes LATS1 and reduces its kinase activity. We therefore
asked how 17-AAG affects the phosphorylation of a physiologic LATS1 substrate in cells treated with 17-AAG. For these
studies, we examined YAP, a transcriptional coactivator on-

coprotein that is phosphorylated and negatively regulated by
LATS (30), in a panel of cell lines derived from different
tumors, including lung (A549, H460), colon (HCT-116), osteosarcoma (U2OS), and ovarian (OVCAR5) cancers. In all of
these cell lines, LATS1 levels were reduced after 6 hours of
17-AAG treatment (Fig. 4A); in all but one cell line (H460),
LATS1 levels continued to decline at 24 hours. A different
pattern emerged when we analyzed YAP phosphorylation
on Ser127, a site phosphorylated by LATS1 (30). In most of

Figure 4. 17-AAG depletes LATS1, reduces YAP Ser127 phosphorylation, and induces CTGF expression in tumor cell lines and human tumors. A, cell lines
were treated with 0.1% DMSO vehicle (−) or 17-AAG for 6 or 24 hours. Cell lysates were then immunoblotted for the indicated antigens. P-YAP,

immunoblotted with the same antibody; the HSP90 blot for these samples shows the starting lysates. D, paired patient ovarian cancer biopsies taken before
(Pre) and 22 to 26 hours after single-agent 17-AAG treatment (Post) were probed for the indicated antigens. To adjust for widely varying LATS1 levels,
three exposures are shown for LATS1 immunoblots. Inter., intermediate.

the cell lines (HCT-116, U2OS, OVCAR5, and H460), YAP
Ser127 phosphorylation was reduced after 6 and/or 24 hours
of 17-AAG exposure. However, this phosphorylation was essentially unchanged in A549 cells and slightly increased in
MCF10A cells after 17-AAG, despite reduced levels of LATS1
and LATS2 (data not shown, but see Fig. 1). Importantly, similar effects on LATS1 and YAP phosphorylation were also seen
with the HSP90 inhibitor PU-H71 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Consistent with a reduction in YAP phosphorylation, which
prevents accumulation of YAP in the nucleus, 17-AAG caused
increased YAP levels in the nuclei of density-arrested U2OS
cells (Fig. 4B), thus showing that the 17-AAG–dependent
YAP phosphorylation is promoting accumulation of the
transcriptional coactivator.
We reasoned that if 17-AAG reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of YAP and promoted its accumulation in the
nucleus, then this agent should induce the expression of a
YAP-regulated gene. One of the genes regulated by YAPTEAD complexes is CTGF (9, 46), which is important for
YAP-induced transformation-associated phenotypes, including anchorage-independent cell proliferation and the ability
to form colonies in soft agar (9). We therefore examined
how HSP90 inhibition affects the levels of CTGF. In all
the cell lines examined, including the cell lines in which
17-AAG had only modest effects on YAP Ser127 phosphorylation, we observed CTGF accumulation after 6 and/or
24 hours of treatment with 17-AAG (Fig. 4C) or PU-H71
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
To assess the effect of 17-AAG on LATS and LATS downstream signaling in a clinically relevant setting, we took advantage of paired ovarian cancer biopsy samples taken from
patients before and 22 to 26 hours after administration of
single-agent 17-AAG as part of a recently completed phase
II clinical trial in ovarian cancer. An analysis of these samples revealed several pertinent findings (Fig. 4D). First, all
tumors expressed LATS1, but the levels were highly variable, with some expressing very low levels (patient 1) and
others expressing far higher levels (patient 2). Second,
LATS1 levels were reduced after 17-AAG treatment, but
the magnitude of the reduction varied. Third, in at least
one sample (patient 1) phosphorylation on YAP Ser127
was reduced, whereas there was no (or perhaps very modest) reduction in patient 2 or 3. Fourth, in all three patients,
CTGF levels were increased, with the greatest increase in
patient 1, who, notably, had the most pronounced decrease
in phospho-YAP. Taken together, these results indicate that
17-AAG treatment in vitro and in the clinical setting can
lead to LATS1 downregulation, reduced phosphorylation
of YAP on sites that restrain the transcriptional coactivator
function of this oncoprotein, and coincident accumulation
of CTGF, a protein implicated in tumorigenesis, metastasis,
and angiogenesis.

Discussion
In this study we showed for the first time that LATS1 and
LATS2 are depleted from nontransformed and tumor cell
lines, as well as primary human tumors by HSP90 inhibitors,

8648

and found that LATS1 and LATS2 interact with HSP90, thus
demonstrating that these kinases are HSP90 clients. We also
observed that in many cell lines, HSP90 inhibition reduced
YAP phosphorylation on Ser127, a site phosphorylated by
LATS1 and LATS2 in intact cells, showing that HSP90 inhibition reduces the ability of LATS to phosphorylate its cellular
target. Consistent with the reduced YAP phosphorylation,
we found that HSP90 inhibition caused increased levels of
CTGF, which is encoded by a gene that is trans-activated by
YAP-TEAD complexes.
These findings are important on several levels. First, we
have discovered that although 17-AAG caused the depletion
of LATS in all the cell lines examined, 17-AAG–mediated reductions in LATS1 and LATS2 were not accompanied by decreases in YAP phosphorylation in all lines. Although this
result was initially perplexing, a recent report found that another, as yet unidentified, kinase can also phosphorylate YAP
on Ser127 (19). Thus, it is possible that in some cells YAP
activity is restrained by a kinase(s) that is not depleted by,
and may even be stimulated in response to, HSP90 inhibition.
The assessment of this possibility will have to await the identification of the novel YAP kinase.
Second, we made the unexpected observation that
MOB1, a small protein that binds and activates LATS1,
dramatically reduces the HSP90 dependence of LATS1
and delays the loss of the kinase in cells treated with
17-AAG. Intriguingly, however, although LATS1 was stabilized by MOB1, HSP90 inhibition still reduced the autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activity of the
stabilized kinase. Although we do not currently understand
the biochemical basis for this observation, we suspect that
the kinase domain requires HSP90 chaperoning to assume
a catalytically competent state, but that even in the absence of appropriate kinase domain folding, MOB1B binding stabilizes LATS1. In contrast, in the absence of
MOB1B, LATS1 can only acquire a stable state with a correctly folded kinase domain.
Third, our results raise important questions about
HSP90 inhibitors as tumor treatments. The intense interest
in HSP90 inhibitors as anticancer treatments is underscored by the fact that >20 Phase I or II clinical trials
are currently underway (as listed in http://clinicaltrials.
gov) to test the activities of a variety of HSP90 inhibitors
in adult and pediatric neoplasms (2). Despite this intense
interest, the compelling underlying basic biology of HSP90
inhibition in cancer cells, and exciting preclinical results
(1), the effects of these inhibitors in the clinic have been
disappointing to date (47). Although it remains unclear
why these agents have shown such limited clinical activity,
one possibility is that HSP90 inhibition has unanticipated
effects that counter the antitumor effects of these agents.
For example, HSP90 inhibition has been shown to promote
prostate cancer cell growth (48), possibly by transiently
stimulating activation of c-Src, a tyrosine kinase oncoprotein (49), and enhance bone metastasis of xenografted
breast cancers (50). Similarly, the present results show that
17-AAG disrupts the LATS-MST2-YAP tumor suppressor
pathway, raising additional questions about the effects of
