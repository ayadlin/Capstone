Abstract

Author Manuscript

MMP-2 plays pivotal role in the degradation of extracellular matrix, and thereby enhances the
invasive, proliferative and metastatic potential in cancer. Knockdown of MMP-2 using MMP-2
siRNA (pM) in human glioma xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310 decreased cell proliferation
compared to mock- and pSV-(scrambled vector)treatments, as determined by BrDU incorporation,
Ki-67 staining and clonogenic survival assay. Cytokine array and Western blotting using tumor
conditioned media displayed modulated secretory levels of various cytokines including GM-CSF,
IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, angiogenin, VEGF and PDGF-BB in MMP-2 knockdown cells. Further,
cDNA PCR array indicated potential negative regulation of JAK/Stat3 pathway in pM-treated
cells. Mechanistically, MMP-2 is involved in complex formation with α5 and β1 integrins and
MMP-2 downregulation inhibited α5β1 integrin mediated Stat3 phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation. EMSA and ChIP assays showed inhibited Stat3 DNA-binding activity and
recruitment at CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters in pM-treated cells. In individual experiments, IL-6
or siRNA-insensitive MMP-2 overexpression by pM-FL-A141G counteracted and restored the
pM-inhibited Stat3 DNA-binding activity suggesting IL-6/Stat3 signaling suppression in pMtreated 4910 and 5310 cells. MMP-2/α5β1 binding is enhanced in rhMMP-2 treatments resulting
in elevated Stat3 DNA-binding activity and recruitment on CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters.
Activation of α5β1 signaling by Fibronectin adhesion elevated pM-inhibited Stat3
phosphorylation whereas blocking α5β1 abrogated constitutive Stat3 activation. In vivo
experiments with orthotropic tumor model revealed the decreased tumor size in pM-treatment
compared to mock- or pSV-treatments. Immunoflorescence studies in tumor sections corroborated

our in vitro findings evidencing high expression and co-localization of MMP-2/α5β1, which is
decreased upon pM-treatment along with significantly reduced IL-6, phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1, cMyc, Ki-67 and PCNA expression levels. Our data indicates the possible role of MMP-2/α5β1

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Tumor progression is orchestrated by an intricate set of cytokines which play key roles in
attenuation of apoptosis and enhanced invasion and metastases of cancer tissue (8, 19).
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) belongs to a family of cytokines participating in gp130 receptor
signaling in the activation of JAK/Stat3 activation in several cancers including glioblastoma
and high circulating IL-6 levels are associated with increased tumor malignancy (20–24).
Upon stimulation, IL-6 binds to sIL-6R, which then induces gp130 dimerization and Janus
kinases (JAKs) phosphorylation which facilitate recruitment, phosphorylation, and
subsequent nuclear translocation of STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of
Transcription) proteins (25) Persistent Stat3 activation is a hallmark of several human
cancers, and it acts as a critical transcriptional mediator of oncogenic signaling, enhancing
cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis via activation of its target genes,
which encode anti-apoptotic and angiogenic factors (26–30). High Stat3 activity is

High proliferative and invasive behavior of malignant tumors of the central nervous system
is responsible for inefficacy of existing treatment procedures (1). Glioma malignancy is, in
part, attributed to the action of a group of metallo-, cysteine and serine proteases, which
degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (2, 3). Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is
a 72 kDa, Zn+2-dependent secreted endopeptidase and its elevated expression is highly
correlated with increased tumor progression implicating its multiple roles in tumor cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (4). Enhanced glioma malignancy is
also characterized by aberrant expression of integrins, which comprises 18 α and 8 β
subunits that combine to form about 24 heterodimers, and their dynamic interactions with
ECM molecules generate intracellular oncogenic signaling events (5). Several studies
demonstrated the significance of MMP-2/αVβ3 integrin liaison in the regulation of tumor
proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis (6–9). Along with αVβ3, integrin α5β1 (Very Late
Antigen 5, VLA5) is also implicated to enhance tumor progression by triggering various
survival signaling pathways including PI3K-AKT, Bcl-2, and NF-κB (10–14). Recently
accumulating evidences shows α5β1-mediated modulation of MMP-2 activity and suggests
a direct interaction between MMP-2 and α5 integrin in melanoma and breast cancer cells
(15–17). Migrating astrocytes show co-localization of MMP-2 with β1 integrin at the cell
periphery, indicating its significance in pericellular proteolysis (18). However, knowledge
on MMP-2/α5β1 interaction and its role in the regulation of α5β1-mediated signaling
pathways in glioma is still lacking.

correlated with enhanced MMP-2 activity, which is itself a Stat3 target gene and blockade of
Stat3 activity by dominant-negative-Stat3 or treatment with JAK-inhibitor significantly
reduced MMP activity (31–33). Specific inhibition of the of Stat3 signaling cascade
inhibited invasion and migration in glioma and tumor growth in lung cancer (22, 34, 35).

Author Manuscript

Our previous studies with MMP-2 knockdown in human lung cancer and glioma cell lines
inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration and led to apoptotic cell death (36) Based on
the complexity of integrin signaling and our preliminary cytokine expression analysis of the
culture supernatants (which revealed a significant suppression of several cytokines under
MMP-2 depleted conditions), we sought to determine the possible modulation of β1
integrin-mediated IL-6/Stat3 activation and its implication in MMP-2.siRNA-induced cell
death in human glioma xenograft cell lines. Taken together, the detailed analysis of
constitutive Stat3 inhibition with MMP-2.siRNA and α5β1 blocking treatments confirmed
the substantial interaction of MMP-2/α5β1 integrin by immunocomplex formation and
further elucidates the mechanistic role of MMP-2/α5β1 in IL-6/Stat3 signaling activation in
glioma.

RESULTS
MMP-2 knockdown inhibited human glioma xenograft cell proliferation

Author Manuscript

The significant inhibition in MMP-2 expression and activity in pM-treated 4910 and 5310
cells in comparison to mock- and pSV- treated cells at 48 h was confirmed by RT-PCR,
Western blotting and gelatin zymography (Supplementary Figure S1A). BrDU proliferation
assay at pre-determined time intervals indicated that the pM-transfected cells showed a timedependent decrease in proliferation rate from 24 to 96 hours compared to mock and pSVtreated cells. A significant inhibition in proliferation up to 56.5% (72 hours) and 66.1% (96
hours) was documented in pM-treated 4910 cells. The 5310 cells displayed 56.2% and
65.4% decrease in BrDU incorporation at 72 and 96 hours of post-transfection, respectively
(Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence showed decreased nuclear Ki-67 staining in pM-treated
cells compared to mock- and pSV-treated controls (Figure 1B). Further, monolayer colony
formation assay showed severe hindrance in the colony forming efficiency of pM-treated
cells (Figure 1C). After 10 days, there was up to ≥70.8% and ≥71.2% inhibition in colony
formation in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells respectively when compared to their control
counterparts (Figure 1D).
MMP-2 downregulation decreased α5 and β1 integrin expression and MMP-2/α5β1
interaction

Author Manuscript

A possible interaction between MMP-2 and α5β1 has been implicated in the modulation of
MMP-2 activity and subsequent tumor cell invasion has been reported previously in
melanoma and breast cancer cells (15–17). Several reports suggested the positive regulation
of survival signaling by α5β1 integrin and targeting by α5β1 antagonists decreased
proliferation in tumor cells (37, 38). Based on the previous reports suggesting possible
MMP-2/α5β1 integrin interaction and with the prominent proliferation inhibition upon
MMP-2 downregulation in our studies we next checked the effect of MMP-2 knockdown on
α5 and β1 integrin expression levels. Both α5 and β1 mRNA and protein expression levels

were remarkably reduced and densitometric analysis showed up to ~60% reduction in pMtreated 4910 and 5310 cells compared to control counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1B,
Figure 2A). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed immunocomplex formation of
MMP-2/α5 and MMP-2/β1 by physical interaction in un-treated 4910 and 5310 cells
whereas pM-treated cells show decreased interaction (Figure 2B). Eventually co-IP blots
were re-probed with antibody used for immunoprecipitation to check the band specificity,
input samples were subjected to Western blotting, and GAPDH levels were estimated to
confirm equal loading. Confocal studies signified a strong co-localization of MMP-2 with
α5β1 in mock- and pSV-treated 4910 and 5310 cells. On the other hand, pM-transfected
cells showed noticeable inhibition in MMP-2 and α5β1 expression, which subsequently led
to decreased MMP-2/α5β1 co-localization. Densitometric analysis showed significant
reduction (up to ~67%) in MMP-2/α5β1 co-localization upon pM-treatment for 48 hours
(Figure 2C). To further verify the MMP-2/α5β1 interaction, we overexpressed siRNAinsensitive Myc-tagged MMP-2 (pM-FL-A141G) in 4910 and 5310 cells. MMP-2
overexpression was confirmed by Western blotting analysis in comparison to mock or pEV
controls (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Immunoprecipitation and probing with anti-MMP-2 and
anti-Myc antibodies confirmed enhanced MMP-2/α5β1 binding in pM-FL-A141G treated
cells compared to mock and pEV control counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1C). siRNAinsensitive MMP-2 overexpression upon pM-FL-A141G treatment was confirmed by
Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1D). The prominent decreases in MMP-2 and α5β1
expression levels and interaction in pM treatments and enhancement of MMP-2/α5β1
binding by pM-FL-A141G treatment suggests a role of MMP-2 binding in α5β1 integrinmediated intracellular signaling. The high expression and co-localization of MMP-2 and
α5β1 integrin was also evident in the human glioblastoma tissues implicating the
significance of MMP-2/α5β1 binding in glioma malignancy where as normal brain tissues
did not show noticeable expression and MMP-2/α5β1 co-localization (Supplementary Figure
S2).
MMP-2 downregulation altered cytokine secretion pattern in glioma xenograft cells

Author Manuscript

The tumor microenvironment is characterized by enhanced cytokine levels, which in turn
activates signaling pathways facilitating exacerbation of proliferation, differentiation, and
invasion of the tumor cells (19). With the prominent reduction of proliferation in MMP-2
knockdown cells, we next sought to evaluate the secretory cytokine profile in the
extracellular milieu. As described in Materials and Methods, conditioned media consisting
of secretory cytokines and growth factors was collected from pSV- and pM-treated cells and
subjected to cytokine array which indicated a prominent modulation in cytokine release
pattern with an inhibition in several cytokines including GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, Angiogenin, VEGF, and PDGF-BB in MMP-2-knockdown cells. Densitometric analysis
of cytokine array showed significant (p<0.01) and moderate (p<0.05) differences among
pSV and pM treatments. Upon pM-treatment a significant inhibition in GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8,
IL-10, VEGF, and PDGF-BB (at p<0.01) and a moderate decrease in TNF-α (p<0.05) was
documented in both 4910 and 5310 cells (Figure 3A). Angiogenin showed a noticeable
inhibition of up to ~71% in 4910 and a moderate loss up to ~48% in 5310 cells, respectively.
This noticeable reduction in the secretion levels of GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α,
Angiogenin, VEGF, PDGF BB was further confirmed by subjecting conditioned media to

Western blot analysis in both 4910 and 5310 cell lines (Figure 3B). The significant loss of
cytokine secretion is in correlation with the reduction of cellular expression levels of
cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in MMP-2 knockdown 4910 and 5310 cells (Figure 3C).
MMP-2 depletion altered JAK/STAT pathway gene expression

Author Manuscript

Interleukin-6 is one of the abundantly expressed cytokine in the tumor microenvironment,
which binds to gp130 receptor and subsequently activates JAK/STAT survival signaling.
Based on the striking downregulation of cellular and secreted IL-6 levels in pM-treated
cells, we further checked the possible modulation Stat3 signaling pathway genes by
performing JAK/STAT pathway PCR array and compared gene expression profiles in pSVand pM- treated cells. The significant fold change deviation from threshold value were
indicated which included the genes encoding JAK receptor proteins, other interacting
proteins, and Stat3-target proteins. Among the various downregulated Stat3 signaling related
genes, the essential receptor proteins such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor);
IL-6ST (gp130); IL2RG (Interleukin 2 receptor, gamma); IL1-RA (Interleukin 10 receptor,
alpha); IL-4R (Interleukin 4 receptor); Tyk2 (Tyrosine kinase 2); JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and
Csf2rb (Colony stimulating factor 2 receptor, beta), showed decreased expression implying a
modulation of expression of several receptor proteins in the pM treatment group of both cell
lines (Table 1). The PCR array analysis also revealed a noticeable downregulation in Stat3
target genes encoding for c-Myc, Bcl-2L1, CyclinD1 and upregulation in Stat3 signaling
suppressors including PIAS1, SOCS1, CDKI1A and PP2Aα confirming the potential
negative regulation of Stat3 pathway in MMP-2 depleted cells.
MMP-2 depletion inhibited constitutive Stat3 activation in glioma xenograft cells

Western blotting showed considerable decrease in gp130, phospho-JAK1, JAK1, phosphoJAK2, JAK2 and phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705 and Ser-727) expression levels with no noticeable
change in total Stat3 in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells whereas constitutive Stat3 activation
were documented in both mock- and pSV-treated controls (Figure 4A). Even though the
inhibition in Stat3 phosphorylation was evident at 24 h we observed further decrease at 48
hours post pM-transfection indicating that this effect was time-dependent (data not shown).
Fluorescence microscopy showed conspicuous reduction in phospho-Stat3 expression and
subsequent nuclear translocation in MMP-2 knockdown cells. In contrast, mock- and pSVtreated cells show high expression of phospho-Stat3 distributed throughout cytoplasm, with
prominent nuclear localization (Figure 4B). To further assess the effect of pM on Stat3
DNA-binding activity, EMSA was performed which revealed a high Stat3 activity in both
mock- and pSV-treated 4910 and 5310 controls. Conversely, a prominent decrease in DNAbinding activity was evidenced in 48 h pM-transfected cells implying that the loss of
MMP-2 leads to suppression of constitutive STAT3 activation (Figure 4C). Further, the
recruitment of Stat3 was assessed by ChIP assay which showed a strong occupancy of Stat3
at CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters in both mock- and pSV-treated 4910 and 5310 cells. In
contrast, MMP-2 suppression using pM noticeably inhibited the Stat3 recruitment on to
CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters suggesting the downregulation of these proteins (Figure
4D). Western blotting showed a remarkable downregulation in Stat3 target proteins
CyclinD1, c-Myc, Bcl-xL, Bcl2 and Survivin in pM-treated 4910 and 5310 cells in
comparison to control counterparts (Figure 4E). Eventually, to rule out the off-target effects

of pM on negative regulation of α5β1-mediated IL-6/Stat3 activation and proliferation in
4910 and 5310 cell lines, parallel MMP-2 knockdown experiments were also performed
using pM-1 (siRNA in pcDNA3.0 targeting the 1073–1094 position in MMP-2 cDNA),
pM-2 (sc-29398) and siRNA-specific scrambled vectors pSV-1 and pSV-2. Comparable to
pM-induced MMP-2 knockdown, pM-1 and pM-2 treatments also resulted in a noticeable
decrease in proliferation compared to respective pSV-1 and pSV-2 controls (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). The conditioned media from pM-1 and pM-2 treated cells showed drastic
reduction in the secreted levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in corroboration with the
downregulation of cellular expression levels of α5 integrin, β1 integrin, IL-6, phospho-Stat3,
(Supplementary Fig. S3B, S3C). The effect of MMP-2 downregulation was also evaluated in
another two human glioma cell lines, U251 and U87, which confirmed the noticeable
decrease in proliferation and suppression of α5, β1, IL-6, expression and JAK1, JAK2 and
Stat3 phosphorylation levels (Supplementary Fig. S4).

IL-6 mediates pM-induced inhibition of constitutive Stat3 activation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the significance of MMP-2.siRNA-induced IL-6 inhibition on
subsequent JAK/Stat3 pathway attenuation, we overexpressed IL-6 and confirmed the
enhanced mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-6 in transfected 4910 and 5310 cells
after 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5A). There was remarkable elevation of gp130,
phopsho-JAK1, JAK1, phospho-JAK2, JAK2 and phospho-Stat3 expression levels in cells
treated with pIL-6 alone or pSV+pIL-6 compared to either mock- or pSV-treated cells. In
contrast the expression levels of IL-6, phospho-JAK2, and phosho-Stat3 in pM+IL-6
treatments were elevated when compared to pM treatment alone and lesser in comparison to
either pIL-6 or pSV+pIL-6 treatments, implying a significant reversal of phospho-Stat3
inhibition by IL-6 overexpression in pM-treated cells. The reversal in gp130, phosphoJAK1, JAK1, phospho-JAK2, JAK2 and phospho-Stat3 expression correlated with IL-6
overexpression in pM-treated cells, further implying that the MMP-2 depletion attenuated
the IL-6-mediated Stat3 activation (Figure 5A). Corroborating previous reports showing
MMP-2 as a potential Stat3 target gene, IL-6 overexpression in turn resulted in remarkable
elevation in MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity, which was suppressed in pM+pIL-6 combination
treatment (Supplementary Figure S5B). Additionally, EMSA also showed significant
reversal of IL-6-induced Stat3-DNA binding activity in pM+pIL-6 treatment suggesting that
the loss of MMP-2 activity inhibited the IL-6 mediated Stat3 activation (Figure 5B).
Confocal microscopy also revealed elevation in phospho-Stat3 nuclear localization in pIL-6treated cells compared to mock-treated cells and pM+pIL-6-treated cells showed an
expression pattern similar to either mock or pSV treatment confirming the reversal of pMinhibited phospho-Stat3 nuclear localization in pIL-6-treated cells (Supplementary Figure
S5C). The effect of pM and pM+pIL-6 treatments was further checked on cell proliferation
using BrDU assay. IL-6 overexpression restored the pM-inhibited proliferation in pM+pIL-6
treatment (Figure 5C). Additionally, we observed a consistent reversal in pM-induced PARP
and caspase-3 cleavage, and inhibition in CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression levels in pM
+pIL-6-treated cells, which directly indicates that the loss of MMP-2 leads to the
suppression of IL-6/Stat3 proliferation signaling (Figure 5D).

Overexpression of siRNA-insensitive MMP-2 or supplementation of rhMMP-2 counteracts
pM-induced Stat3 suppression and apoptosis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To establish specificity of pM-inhibited IL-6/Stat3 activation and to avoid any off-target
consequences, we treated mock-, pSV- and pM-treated cells with siRNA-insensitive MMP-2
overexpression plasmid (pM-FL-A141G) or rhMMP-2 as described in Materials and
Methods. The expression levels of α5, β1, phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc were
elevated in both pM-FL-A141G and rhMMP-2 treated cells, implicating a possible role of
MMP-2 in the regulation of the α5β1-mediated Stat3 activation and cell proliferation (Figure
6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, the loss-and-gain of function approach by pM and pM-FLA141G or rhMMP-2 treatments showed a significantly enhanced MMP-2/α5β1 association
by complex formation in rhMMP-2- or pM-FL-A141G-treated cells and decreased
association in pM-treated cells. Immunoprecipitation with non-specific (Nsp-IgG) did not
show precipitation and re-probing the IP blots with anti-α5, anti-β1 and anti-Myc antibodies
further confirmed the band specificity. Densitometric analysis of relative binding confirmed
that the pM+rhMMP-2 or pM+pM-FL-A141G combination treatment noticeably
counteracted the rhMMP-2- or pM-FL-A141G-elevated MMP-2/α5β1 binding, which
further evidences direct substantial MMP-2/α5β1 integrin interaction in both 4910 and 5310
cells. In correlation with MMP-2 overexpression-induced MMP-2/α5β1 binding, EMSA
displayed obvious elevation in Stat3 DNA-binding activity in rhMMP-2 treatment which is
reduced in pM+rhMMP-2-treated cells confirming the role of MMP-2 in maintaining
constitutive Stat3 activity (Figure 6C). A noticeable elevation in Stat3 occupancy on to
CylcinD1 and c-Myc promoters was observed in pM-FL-A141G- or rhMMP-2-treated 4910
and 5310 cells. In corroboration with the reversal of MMP-2/α5β1 complex formation in pM
+rhMMP-2 and pM+pM-FL-A141G treated cells, a clear reversal in Stat3 promoter
recruitment was observed suggesting a role of MMP-2 in α5β1-mediated Stat3 activation
and promoter binding (Figure 6D). Additionally, the pM-induced loss of cell proliferation
was reversed in pM+rhMMP-2 or pM+pM-FL-A141G treatments whereas individual
rhMMP-2 or pM-FL-A141G treatments alone enhanced the proliferation rate in both cell
lines indicating the role of MMP-2 in maintenance of tumor cell proliferation (Figure 6E).
Blocking α5β1 Integrin negated the rhMMP-2-induced IL-6/Stat3 activation

Author Manuscript

To further assess the pM-inhibited α5β1 signaling, we elevated the β1 signaling by FN
adhesion in mock-, pSV- and pM-treated cells. Western blotting indicated the α5β1mediated elevation in phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression levels were decreased
in pM-treated cells evidencing the role of MMP-2 in the regulation of α5β1-mediated Stat3
activation (Figure 7A). The essential functional role of MMP-2/α5β1 interaction on
rhMMP-2-induced and pM-inhibited activation of IL-6/Stat3 was verified by treating the
cells with α5β1 blocking antibody in combination with pM and rhMMP-2 treatments. The
effect of α5β1 blocking antibody on pM-inhibited IL-6/Stat3 activation and subsequent cell
survival was checked to investigate the role of MMP-2/α5β1 coupling in these tumor cell
lines. Blocking of α5β1 integrin further reduced the pM-inhibited recruitment of Stat3 on
both CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoters suggesting the functional significance of MMP-2 and
α5β1 integrin co-operativity (Figure 7B). Supplementation of α5β1 blocking antibody to
rhMMP-2-treated 4910 and 5310 cells substantially decreased the rhMMP-2-induced
expression levels of IL-6, phospho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc. On the other hand,

augmentation of α5β1 blocking antibody to pM-treated cells further decreased the pMinhibited expression levels of IL-6, phopsho-Stat3, CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression levels
implying the significance of MMP-2 binding in α5β1-mediated Stat3 activation and cell
survival. The expression levels of Stat3 target proteins CyclinD1 and c-Myc were severely
reduced and almost undetectable in pM+anti-α5β1 integrin treatments in both the cell lines
when compared to either pM- or anti-α5β1 integrin-treatments indicating that the loss of
MMP-2 augments the inhibitory effects of α5β1 blocking antibody (Figure 7C). The
combination of pM and α5β1 substantially inhibited the rhMMP-2-induced Stat3 activation
and expression of CyclinD1 and c-Myc proteins when compared to either pM or anti-α5β1
treatments alone, which indicates that the disruption of MMP-2 and α5β1 association
inhibits IL-6/Stat3 survival signaling leads to decrease in proliferation in 4910 and 5310
glioma xenograft cells.

pM-inhibited intracranial tumor growth in athymic mice

Author Manuscript

In vivo experiments showing the effect of pM-treatment on intracranial tumor growth by
orthotropic injection of 4910 and 5310 cells showed remarkable decrease in the tumor size
when compared to mock- and pSV-treated tumors (Figure 8A). High expression and
predominant co-localization MMP-2 and α5β1 integrin at membrane periphery were
identified in both mock- and pSV-treated tumors (Figure 8B). In contrast, pM-treated tumors
showed substantial decrease in MMP-2 and α5β1 expression, which subsequently led to
decreased MMP-2/α5β1 co-localization correlating with reduced IL-6 and phospho-Stat3
expression levels (Figure 8C). Further expression levels of proliferation markers Ki-67 and
PCNA were studied to check the number of proliferating cells in sections which revealed the
severely inhibition Ki-67 and PCNA positivity in pM-treated tumor sections whereas the
mock- and pSV- treated control tumors showed high proliferating cells with intense nuclear
Ki-67 and PCNA staining (Supplementary Figure S6). The CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression
was significantly decreased in pM-treated tumor sections when compared to pSV-treated
control counterparts (Supplementary Figure S7). These in vivo observations corroborate the
in vitro findings confirming the role of MMP-2 in α5β1 mediated IL-6/Stat3 signaling
activation in glioma.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Apoptotic cell death plays a crucial role in the development of multi-cellular organisms, but
it is also a major concern in cancer treatment as cancer is a consequence of aberrant cell
proliferation there by manipulation of the extra- and intracellular signals directing
intracellular oncogenic signaling activation may serve to drive tumor cells towards cell
death (39). MMPs are the extracellular matrix remodeling proteases that act as critical
mediators in tumor microenvironment changes (2). Integrins are membrane-spanning
proteins, with their extracellular domains bound to the ECM proteins while their
cytoplasmic tails facilitate assembly of intracellular proteins and propagate the outside-in
signaling. Among other integrins, accumulating evidences indicate the high expression of
α5β1 in glioblastoma cells suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic target (37, 40). One
of the key mechanisms of integrins is their interaction and modulation of MMP activity (16,
17). The α5β1 integrin activates NF-κB proliferative signaling and elevates the expression

of genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation whereas Chinese hampster ovary
(CHO) cells expressing truncated α5Δcβ1 without the cytoplasmic domain show impaired
NF-κB activation, leading to cell death (13, 41). In a recent report, Shain et al. (42)
demonstrated the role of β1 integrin in IL-6 mediated Stat3 survival signaling in multiple
myeloma cells. Studies on the blockade of the IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway by anti-IL-6
receptor antibody substantially inhibited tumor progression by downregulating Stat3
signaling in human colon carcinoma cells (43). Targeting β1 integrins with β1-inhibitory
antibody significantly inhibits proliferation by apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo (44). A non-RGD-based peptide inhibitor of α5β1 integrin ATN-161 and a functional
blocking α5β1 integrin antibody blocks in vivo tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer
cells (45). The N-glycosylation of Interaction-like (I-like) domain of β1 integrin is required
for α5β1 heterodimer formation, and the role of α5β1 in tumor cell survival signaling has
been elucidated previously (12, 13, 38, 46). On the other hand, the α5β1 integrin functional
blocking inhibitory antibody Volociximab significantly reduced tumor growth in mouse and
rabbit VX2 carcinoma models (47).

Though several studies suggested the effect of various integrins on the manipulation of
cytokine levels, the effect of α5β1 integrin heterodimer on IL-6 expression and its
downstream signaling is unknown. A functional significance of the MMP-2/β1 integrin
binding was confirmed by immunoprecipitation in the negative regulation of human
endothelial cell apoptosis has been reported earlier (48). Association between MMP-2 and
α5β1 integrin by direct binding in melanoma and breast cancer cells and co-localization of
MMP-2/α5β1 in migrating astrocytes has been indicated previously (16–18). Based on these
reports, we sought to determine whether there was any direct interaction of MMP-2/α5β1
integrin by complex formation in glioma. Here, for the first time, we show significant
interaction of MMP-2 with α5β1 heterodimer in human glioma xenograft cells both in vitro
and in vivo. However, our co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies do not show
direct binding between MMP-2 and α5β1 integrin but indicate that they form a complex
which may be bridged by unidentified proteins. Recent reports showed the effect of NF-κB
blockade on inhibition of cancer cell adhesion via downregulation of α2, α3 and β1 integrins
(49). Previous studies on MMP-2 knockdown showed inhibition of NF-κB nuclear
localization and DNA-binding activity (50). Our present studies showing pM-inhibited β1
integrin transcriptional and protein expression suggest a possible indirect role of pMinhibited NF-κB in the downregulation of these integrin molecules. The role of β1 integrin
in enhancing IL-6 mediated Stat3 signaling in multiple myeloma has been previously
elucidated (42). Role of IL-6 in JAK/Stat3-mediated MMP-2 activation in pancreatic and
glioma cancer cells and MMP-10 activation in lung adenocarcinoma cells has been reported
to enhance growth and invasion (32, 51, 52). Farber, et al. (37) showed that the treatment
with α5β1 integrin inhibitor JSM6427 does not have any effect on the cytokine release
pattern in microglial cells. However, in our studies with glioma xenograft cell lines, the
MMP-2 siRNA-mediated inhibition of α5β1 expression is in correlation with changes in the
cytokine release pattern in 4910 and 5310 cells, suggesting the effects of α5β1 inhibition are
cell-specific. The significance of IL-6 in tumor progression has been reported (53, 54). The
specific role of MMP-2 downregulation on inhibition of α5, β1, IL-6 expression and Stat3
phosphorylation were further confirmed by employing 3 different MMP-2.siRNAs and this

effect was also checked in U251 and U87 human glioma cell lines. Our studies with α5β1
blocking by functional blocking antibody paralleled with the effect of MMP-2
downregulation inhibiting IL-6 expression and hindered Stat3 phosphorylation and
recruitment on to Cyclin D1 and c-Myc promoters indicates high relevance to MMP-2/α5β1
interaction in maintaining IL-6 mediated constitutive Stat3 activation in glioma. The
significant inhibition of α5β1-mediated IL-6/Stat3 activation in MMP-2 downregulation was
further analyzed in vivo which indicated significant reduction in IL-6, phospho-Stat3 levels
leading to reduced tumor growth. Suppression of IL-6 and IL-8, target genes of NF-κB in
MMP-2 siRNA treatment in both cell lines, is in parallel with our previous observation of
decreased NF-κB activation upon MMP-2 downregulation in both 4910 and 5310 cell lines
(50). Our observations on α5β1 role in the activation of IL-6 mediated Stat3 signaling
activation in glioma xenograft cells also corroborate previous reports on the role of α5β1
integrin adhesion in elevating the IL-6-mediated STAT3 pathway in multiple myeloma cells
(42).
In summary, our findings on MMP-2.siRNA mediated α5β1 suppression in two human
xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310, imply that role of MMP-2 in the regulation α5β1
mediated cellular signaling. The study provides further insights in to the co-operativity
between MMP-2 and α5β1 integrin by indirect physical interaction in the maintenance of
constitutive IL-6 mediated Stat3 DNA-binding activity and expression of subsequent
downstream effector genes suggesting MMP-2 suppression as a potential therapeutic
approach in glioma treatment.

Human glioma xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310 (kindly provided by Dr. David James,
University of California, San Francisco) are highly invasive in mouse brain were developed
and maintained in mice (55). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech Inc.,
Herndon, VA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA), 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.,
Frederick, MD) by incubation in a humidified 5% CO2 chamber at 37°C. Human glioma cell
lines U251 and U87 (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI medium
1640 containing glutamate (5mM) and 5% FBS and maintained in CO2 incubator. We used
antibodies against MMP-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, α5-integrin, β1-integrin, phospho-JAK1

Transient transfection studies were performed as described previously by Kesanakurti et al.
(50). In brief, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.0 containing MMP-2.siRNA sequence
(pM, targets 131–152 nucleotides of MMP-2 cDNA) and specific scrambled siRNA
sequence (pSV) cloned as described previously (50) using FuGene HD transfection reagent
following manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The effect
of MMP-2 downregulation was also checked by transient transfection studies using
MMP-2.siRNA-1 (pM-1 [caaatatgagagctgcaccag], pcDNA3.0 vector containing siRNA
targeting 1073–1094 nucleotides in MMP-2 cDNA) and MMP-2.siRNA-2 (pM-2 [pool of
siRNAs targeting different regions of MMP-2, sc-29398], purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in comparison to specific scrambled vectors pSV-1 and
pSV-2. Full-length cDNA of MMP-2 was RT-PCR amplified using sequence specific
primers and cloned in EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His-A (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) to construct overexpression plasmid (pM-FL). A silent mutation
was introduced within the siRNA-targeted MMP-2 cDNA sequence (nucleotides 131–152,
5’-AACGGACAAAGAGTTGGCAGT-3’) without changing the aminoacid sequence
(nucleotides 131–152, 5’-AACGGACAAGGAGTTGGCAGT-3’) by using pM-FL as a
template and QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA)
following manufacturer’s instructions. This siRNA-insensitive plasmid with A141G
mutation was verified by DNA sequencing and is designated as pM-FL-A141G. For
combination treatments, at 24 h post-transfection with mock (1×PBS), pSV or pM, cells
were further transfected with pIL-6 or pM-FL-A141G or recombinant human MMP-2
(rhMMP-2; 25 ng/mL) or α5β1 blocking antibody (10 µl/mL) were added to the medium and
cells were incubated for another 24 h. The β1 integrin activation by Fibronectin (FN)
adhesion was achieved by detaching the mock-, pSV- and pM-treated cells by trypsinization
after 24 h of transfection and re-plating them on FN-coated culture plates and cells were
incubated for another 24 h.
Semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR and PCR array

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following
manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA using ImPromII Reverse Transcription kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Semi-quantitative PCR
was performed using the following set of primers: MMP-2 sense 5’GTGCTGAAGGACACACTAAAGA-3’ and MMP-2 antisense 5’CCTACAACTTTGAGAAGGATGGCAA-3’; IL-6 sense 5’GAACTCCTTCTCCACAAG-3’ and IL-6 antisense 5’-CTGAAGAGGTGAGTGGCTG-3’;
GAPDH sense 5’-GGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3’ and GAPDH antisense 5’GTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGCT-3’ respectively. PCR array was performed using
Human JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array kit following
manufacturer’s instructions (SA Biosciences, Frederick, MD). This array comprises all Stat3
signaling family members including receptors, nuclear co-factors, and co-activators
associated with the Stat proteins, STAT-inducible genes, and regulators of STAT pathway.
Following PCR conditions using 1 µL of cDNA template were used: 1 cycle of 95°C 10 min
and 40 cycles of 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s, followed by 1 cycle of 72°C 10 min.

Data obtained from three experimental replicates were analyzed using iCycler IQ version 3.1
software (Bio-Rad) and Ct values were converted into fold change, using web-based

ChIP assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays was performed using ChIP-IT™ Express Magnetic
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit following manufacturer’s protocol (Active motif,
Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, cells were fixed in 37% formaldehyde, and chromatin was sheared
by sonication and immunoprecipitated using anti-Stat3 and Normal sheep IgG antibodies by
incubation at 4°C for 2–4 hours on a rotor. The immunoprecipitates was collected by using
magnetic protein G beads (Millipore, Temecula, CA), which were washed thoroughly to
remove non-specific DNA binding. The chromatin was eluted from the beads, and crosslinks were removed by overnight incubation at 65°C. DNA was then purified from the beads
using the chelating resin solution and about 10 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA was used to
detect Stat3 binding to CyclinD1 and c-Myc promoter sequences by standard PCR. The
following ChIP primers were used for c-Myc-sense-5’GAAGCCTGAGCAGGCGGGGCAGG-3’; c-Myc-antisense-5’GCTTTGATCAAGAGTCCCAG-3’ and CyclinD1-sense-5’AACTTGCACAGGGGTTGTGT-3’; CyclinD1-antisense-5’GAGACCACGAGAAGGGGTGACTG-3’ respectively. The amplification was maintained
in a linear range by performing PCR with a serial dilution of input and various cycles (30–
40 cycles). Pre-immunoprecipitated input DNA represents 5% of total chromatin used in
each reaction before immunoprecipitation. Primers specific to GAPDH, 5’CGGTGCGTGCCCAGTTG-3’ and 5’-GCGACGCAAAAGAAGATG-3’ were used for
PCR amplification of input samples as a control to monitor equal loading and non-specific
IgG immunoprecipitates were also loaded (negative control) as described previously (56).
The amplification products were resolved on 2% ethidium bromide agarose gels and
visualized under UV light and data represents three experimental replications.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described previously
by Kesanakurti et al. (57). Shortly, whole cell lysates were isolated using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and equal amounts of protein were resolved
over SDS-PAGE and transferred on to PVDF membrane. Blots were incubated in respective
primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection using an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein
(200µg) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against MMP-2, α5, β1, α5β1 and nonspecific IgG using µMACS™ protein G microbeads and MACS separation columns
following manufacturer’s protocol and immunoprecipitates were subjected to western
blotting.
Gelatin zymography and cytokine array
Gelatin zymographic analyses and cytokine array using tumor conditioned media (CM) were
performed as described previously (50). Briefly, medium was aspirated from culture plates
at 36 h post-transfection, 3 mL of serum-free medium was added and incubated for another

12 h at the end of which tumor-conditioned media (CM) containing the secretory proteins,
cytokines and various growth factors was collected. CM was resolved over 0.1% gelatin
containing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Subsequently, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton
X-100 to remove SDS, followed by 16- to 20-hour incubation at 37°C in Tris-CaCl2 buffer
(pH 7.6), stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (0.25%) and destained to visualize the
gelatinolytic activity. Cytokine array to detect the secretory levels of various cytokines
present in the tumor conditioned media obtained from pSV- and pM-treated cells was
performed using a Human Cytokine Array 3 kit following the manufacturer's instructions
(Ray Biotech®, Norcross, GA). The average signal intensity of each cytokine dotted in
duplicate on the array was estimated in three independent experimental replicates and
denoted as mean±SE while biotin-conjugated and unconjugated IgG signals represented
positive and negative signals in the analysis.

Cell proliferation (BrDU) and Clonogenic assay

Nuclear proteins were isolated using Biovision Nuclear/Cytosol fractionation Kit (Mountain
View, CA) following manufacturer’s protocol. EMSA for STAT3 DNA-binding activity
was performed using Panomics EMSA Kit (Panomics, Inc. Fremont, CA) as described by
Kesanakurti et al. (50). In brief, nuclear extracts (2×106 cells) from different treatments
were allowed to bind with biotin-end-labeled DNA in the presence of 2×binding buffer and
poly dI-dC (deoxyinosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid) by incubation at 15°C for 30 min. These
DNA-protein complexes were subjected to native gel electrophoresis and transferred onto
Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). After transfer, DNA was UV crosslinked, and activity was detected by binding with streptavidin-HRP conjugate and
chemiluminescent substrate.

Proliferation rate in cells was determined by BrDU assay (Roche Applied Science, IN, USA)
measuring the incorporation of pyrimidine analogue, 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrDU)
during DNA synthesis. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-microwell plates, incubated
overnight and subjected to different treatments as described above. Colorimetric estimation
of BrDU incorporation was carried out by quantification of antibody-peroxidase reaction
product at dual wavelengths of 450/540 nm using multiwell spectrophotometer as described
by Ganji et al. (58). Percentage of BrDU incorporation was compared to mock-treated cells
(100%) and represented as mean±SE values obtained in at least three independent
experiments. Mono-layer colony formation assay was performed as described previously
(59). In short, about ~0.5×103 cells were seeded in 100 mm plates and different treatments
were carried out in triplicate as described above and cells were continued to culture for 10
days to allow colony formation. Hema-3 stained colonies were counted under light
microscope to estimate the percentage of colony formation in different treatments.
Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical analyses
Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described
earlier (50). Briefly, after treatments cells in chamber slides were fixed, permeabilized and
incubated with respective primary and Alexa Fluor®-conjugated secondary antibodies and

subsequently mounted. For nuclear counterstaining, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
was used. For immunohistochemical analysis, de-paraffinized tissue sections (4–5 µm) were
blocked in 3% BSA in 1×PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C with respective primary
antibodies followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor®/HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were subsequently counterstained with DAPI,
mounted and observed under confocal microscope. For DAB (3,3’-Diaminobenzidine)
staining, hematoxylin was used for nuclear staining, mounted and pictured under light
microscope.
In vivo experiments

Author Manuscript

4910 and 5310 cells (1×106 cells per mouse) were injected sterotactically into 4-6-week old
female nu/nu mice to establish tumor growth as described earlier (50). Tumors were allowed
to grow for ten days, the animals were divided into three sets (n=10) and Alzet osmotic
pumps (model 2004, ALZET Osmotic Pumps, Cupertino, CA) were implanted for plasmid
delivery (dose: 6–8 mg/kg body weight). Brains were excised after 60 days, fixed,
paraffinized and the tumor area from every fifth Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained tumor
section was manually estimated with the aid of a microscope attached to a computer screen,
using Image Pro Discovery Program software (Media Cybernatics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD).
The tumor volumes were then calculated as summed tumor area on all sections multiplied by
width of the sections and plotted as mean±SE obtained from a group of ten animals.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Data obtained from different sets of treatments were evaluated with one-way ANOVA using
Neumann-Keuls method of Sigmastat 3.1. Densitometric analysis was performed using
ImageJ 1.42 software (NIH) and data are represented in the form of mean±SE obtained from
at least three independent repetitions. Significant difference among different treatment
groups was denoted by * at p≤0.05 and ** at p≤0.01.
