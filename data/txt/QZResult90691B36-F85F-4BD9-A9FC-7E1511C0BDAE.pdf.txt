BACKGROUND: Obesity has been associated with inferior outcomes in operable breast cancer, but the relation between body mass
index (BMI) and outcomes by breast cancer subtype has not been previously evaluated. METHODS: The authors evaluated the relation between BMI and outcomes in 3 adjuvant trials coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group that included chemotherapy regimens with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, including E1199, E5188, and E3189. Results are expressed as hazard ratios
(HRs) from Cox proportional hazards models (HR >1 indicates a worse outcome). All P values are 2-sided. RESULTS: When evaluated
as a continuous variable in trial E1199, increasing BMI within the obese (BMI, 30 kg/m2) and overweight (BMI, 25-29.9 kg/m2) ranges
was associated with inferior outcomes in hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu-negative
disease for disease-free survival (DFS; P ¼ .0006) and overall survival (OS; P ¼ .0007), but not in HER-2/neu–overexpressing or triple-negative disease. When evaluated as a categorical variable, obesity was associated with inferior DFS (HR, 1.24; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.06-1.46; P ¼ .0008) and OS (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.67; P ¼ .002) in hormone receptor-positive disease, but not other
subtypes. In a model including obesity, disease subtype, and their interaction, the interaction term was significant for OS (P ¼ .02)
and showed a strong trend for DFS (P ¼ .07). Similar results were found in 2 other trials (E5188, E3189). CONCLUSIONS: In a clinical
trial population that excluded patients with significant comorbidities, obesity was associated with inferior outcomes specifically in
patients with hormone receptor-positive operable breast cancer treated with standard chemohormonal therapy. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a major public health problem in North America, Europe, and other developed regions of the world.1 A body
mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher has been used to define obesity in most reports, including those showing an association between obesity and increased risk of cancers, cancer mortality, and mortality from all causes.2,3 Obesity rates have
increased 2-fold in adults and 3-fold in children in the past 30 years in the United States, and are also rising in other developed regions worldwide.1 Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, which is the most common
cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and other developed nations worldwide.4,5 Obesity at breast cancer diagnosis has also been associated with inferior survival, including breast cancer-specific
survival.6 Other analyses have indicated that for a clinical trial population of patients with lymph node-negative, estrogenreceptor positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen who have a relatively low risk of cancer recurrence, obesity is
associated with an increased rate of contralateral breast cancer, second primary cancers, and other noncancer-related
deaths.7,8
Gene expression profiling studies have shown that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by distinct
subtypes that have differing clinical behaviors and response to therapy.9-11 Management decisions are based upon predictive factors for response to targeted therapies, such as estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) protein
expression for selecting hormonal therapy,12 and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu protein

overexpression and/or gene amplification for selecting
anti–HER-2-directed therapy.13 Patterns of ER, PR, and
HER-2 expression have been shown to correspond to genotypically defined subsets.14 Understanding the relation
between host-related factors, such as obesity, and tumorrelated factors, such as breast cancer subtype, may have
important implications for identifying factors contributing to recurrence, and thus may impact the management
of localized and advanced disease.
To disentangle the influence of obesity from other
factors influencing recurrence and survival, we compared
the outcomes of obese patients with others in a large
cohort of women with stage I to III breast cancer who participated in 3 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored
trials evaluating the role of chemotherapy or endocrine
therapy regimens.15-17 These trials were completed before
trastuzumab was approved as adjuvant therapy for HER2–positive disease.18,19 All of the trials required normal
cardiac, renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function and
good performance status, thereby excluding patients with
significant comorbidities, potentially minimizing this as a
confounding factor. In addition, patients received standardized care as stipulated by the trial. We found that obe5938

sity was independently associated with inferior outcomes
specifically in patients with hormone receptor-positive,
HER-2/neu–negative disease, but not other breast cancer
subtypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Treatment

The analysis included patients enrolled on 3 NCI-sponsored clinical trials coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) for whom BMI data were
available. Briefly, patients with operable adenocarcinoma
of the female breast with axillary lymph node metastases
(T1-3; N1 or 2) or high-risk lymph node-negative disease
(T2-3, N0 for E1199 only) without distant metastases
were eligible. Other details regarding eligibility, treatment
administered, and results have been previously reported
and are summarized in Table 1.15-17 Chemotherapy was
prescribed by actual body weight and was not adjusted for
obese patients in all trials. The primary analysis was initially performed for E1199, which was the most recent
trial and included the most contemporary chemotherapy
regimens (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel
or docetaxel) and endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or

aromatase inhibitors). After a relation between obesity
and breast cancer was defined in the E1199 study population, similar analyses were performed in the 2 older studies (E5188, E3189) that provided confirmatory findings.
Statistical Analysis

The primary trial endpoints were disease-free survival
(DFS) and overall survival (OS). DFS was defined to be
time from randomization to a first event, including disease recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or death from
any cause. OS was defined as time from randomization to
death from any cause. To determine whether inferior outcomes were attributable to breast cancer recurrence rather
than comorbidities, we also evaluated breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), which was defined as death attributed to breast cancer or preceded by a breast cancer
recurrence, with follow-up censored at the time of death
from other causes. Event-time distributions for DFS and
OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards methods were used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) and test for significance for event times. The
relation between BMI as a continuous variable and DFS/
OS was evaluated using a flexible family of curves (a natural spline with 3 degrees of freedom) to model the effect of
BMI in a proportional hazards model.20 Patient characteristics were compared using Fisher exact test if they were
categorical and Wilcoxon 2-sample test if they were continuous. The adverse events were compared using Fisher
exact test. All P values are 2-sided; confidence intervals
(CIs) are at the 95% level. The analysis was based on a
dataset downloaded in April 2011 for trial E1199, in
which patients are still being followed for recurrence and
survival; the median follow-up for surviving patients was
95 months (7.9 years; range, 0-119 months), at which
time there were 1234 DFS events and 891 deaths (including 695 BCSS events). The BCSS events included 568
patients who were coded by the treating institutions as
dying from breast cancer (64% of all deaths and 82% of
all BCSS events) and 127 patients who had a breast recurrence before death whose death was coded by the treating
site as from an unknown cause (14% of all deaths and
18% of all BCSS events). Other deaths included 118
patients who were coded as dying from other causes (13%
of all deaths), and 78 patients who were coded as dying
from an unknown cause and who did not have breast cancer recurrence before death (9% of all deaths). The median time from recurrence to death for those coded as
dying from breast cancer was 15.2 months; for those
coded as dying from an unknown cause who had a breast
cancer recurrence before death it was 12.4 months.

Data Management and Regulatory Issues

The studies were sponsored by the NCI, reviewed and
approved by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program at
NCI, and developed and coordinated by the ECOG
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00004125). The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board at each participating institution, and all
patients provided written informed consent.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

The characteristics of obese and nonobese patients for trial
E1199 are shown in Table 2. Of the 4770 patients with
BMI data, 1745 (36.6%) were obese, 1540 (32.3%) were
overweight, 1447 (30.3%) had a normal BMI, and 38
(0.8%) were underweight at the time they were enrolled
on the trial after surgery and before initiation of chemotherapy. Obese and overweight patients were older and
more likely to be postmenopausal and black. Obese
patients and overweight patients had somewhat larger primary tumors and were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery, and exhibited somewhat different
distribution of nodal metastases, although the median
number of nodes involved was similar. There were no significant differences in the biologic characteristics of the
tumor, as reflected by ER, PR, or HER-2 expression, nor
in the type of endocrine therapy or chemotherapy given.
Delivery of Adjuvant Therapy and Adverse
Events

The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and grade
3 to 4 adverse events in obese compared with nonobese
patients for the E1199 trial are shown in Table 3. There
were generally no significant differences in the proportion
who received at least 90% of cycle 1 dosing for cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or docetaxel, indicating
that clinicians adhered to the protocol and prescribed
chemotherapy dosing by actual body weight. When evaluating all cycles, drug administration was similar for doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel, although obese
patients were less likely to receive at least 90% relative
dose intensity for every 3-week paclitaxel (80% vs 87%; P
¼ .007) and weekly paclitaxel administration (78% vs
85%; P ¼ .008). During doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, obese patients exhibited less grade 4
neutropenia (32% vs 40%; P < .0001) and more grade 3
to 4 cardiac toxicity (0.2% vs 0%; P ¼ .05), but had comparable rates of grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia, infection,
and overall cardiac toxicity. During taxane therapy, obese
patients exhibited less grade 4 neutropenia (12% vs 15%;

Univariate analyses were performed evaluating the relation between obesity and clinical outcomes in the E1199
trial. When the entire study population was included,
compared with nonobese women, obesity was associated
with significantly inferior DFS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.041.31; P ¼ .0077) and OS (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.40;
P ¼ .0025). For patients with hormone receptor-positive/
HER-2–negative/unknown disease, obesity was likewise
associated with inferior outcomes, including DFS (HR,
1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53; P ¼ .0009) and OS (HR, 1.46;
95% CI, 1.21-1.77; P ¼ .0001; Fig. 1A, B), an effect that
was more pronounced than in the overall population.
This relation was not observed, however, in patients with
triple-negative disease (Fig. 1C, D) or HER-2–positive
disease (Fig. 1E, F). Only 0.8% (n ¼ 38) of patients were
underweight (BMI, <18.5 kg/m2), and the results were
not altered if these patients were excluded (DFS: HR,
1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.53; P ¼ .001; OS: HR, 1.45; 95%
CI, 1.20-1.76; P ¼ .0001 for hormone receptor-positive,
HER-2–negative disease in obese compared with nonobese women). The results were also similar if outcomes
for obese women (BMI, 30 kg/m2) were compared with
those for women with a normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2),
including DFS (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.15-1.70; P ¼
.0007) and OS (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.32-2.15; P <
.0001) for women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2–negative disease, but not other subtypes (data not
shown).

To further evaluate the interaction between obesity and

subtype, and their interaction. For OS, the interaction

Evaluation of Obesity in Multivariate Models and
Validation in Other Trials

After identifying a relation between obesity and inferior
outcomes in trial E1199 specifically in patients with
hormone receptor-positive, HER-2–negative/unknown
disease, we next constructed multivariate models
(Table 4) adjusted for other covariates (including age,
race, menopausal status, tumor size, number of positive

axillary lymph nodes, and type of surgery), and also
performed similar analyses in 2 other clinical trial
populations that included only patients with hormone
receptor-positive disease (E5188) or hormone receptornegative disease (E3189). When adjusted for other
covariates, obesity remained strongly associated in the
E1199 trial population with inferior DFS (HR, 1.24;
95% CI, 1.06-1.46; P ¼ .0079) and OS (HR, 1.37;
95% CI, 1.13-1.67; P ¼ .0015) only for patients with
hormone receptor-positive, HER-2–negative/unknown
disease in trial E1199. For the E5188 trial, which
included only premenopausal women with ER-positive,
axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer, obesity was
likewise associated with inferior DFS (HR, 1.41; 95%
CI, 1.19-1.67; P < .0001) and OS (HR, 1.51; 95%
CI, 1.24-1.83; P < .0001). For the E3189 trial, which
included only patients with ER/PR-negative disease,
there was no relation between obesity and outcomes.
Although trials E5188 and E3189 were performed
before routine HER-2/neu testing in clinical practice
and the information was not available for this analysis,
the findings are nonetheless consistent with the relation
observed in the E1199 trial.
To provide additional confirmation that breast cancer recurrence was contributing to the inferior DFS and
OS observed only in specific breast cancer subtypes, we
also evaluated BCCS. For trial E1199, BCSS was likewise
inferior for those with hormone receptor-positive,
HER-2–negative disease (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.76;
P ¼ .0042), but not for other subtypes (Table 4). Inferior
BCSS was also observed in trial E5188, which included
only patients with ER-positive disease (HR, 1.54; 95%
CI, 1.26-1.88; P < .0001), but not in trial E3189, which
included only patients with ER-negative disease (HR,

0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.15; P ¼ .29). In addition to the
results using cause-specific hazard analysis based on the
Cox proportional hazard methods described above, we
also conducted the subdistribution hazards analysis for
competing risks,21 which produced consistent results
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We evaluated the relation between BMI and clinical outcomes in a cohort of 6885 women with stage I to III breast
cancer enrolled in 3 clinical trials that included adjuvant
doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Similar to previous individual reports and a meta-analysis of these other
reports,6 we found that obese patients, defined as having a
BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher, exhibited a significantly
higher risk of recurrence and death. This is likewise consistent with a population-based study that demonstrated
inferior outcomes for obese patients.22 However, analysis
of the E1199 dataset is the first report to demonstrate that
worse outcomes are observed specifically in women with
hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative disease who
were treated with contemporary chemoendocrine therapy
(including anthracyclines, taxanes, and aromatase inhibitors) but not other breast cancer subtypes. Furthermore,
there was a continuous relation between increasing BMI
and inferior outcomes in this specific subtype, indicating
that excessive weight may also be a surrogate for other factors contributing to recurrence not only in obese but also
in overweight patients.
Although numerous previous studies have shown
an association between obesity and inferior breast cancer outcomes, this report addresses critical limitations
of previous analyses, including uniform adjuvant therapy administration, adjustment for other potentially
confounding covariates, evaluation of outcomes in specific breast cancer subtypes, and sufficient maturity of
follow-up data to detect late relapses typically associated with hormone receptor-positive disease.23 Few
previous studies have evaluated the effect of obesity
stratified by hormone receptor expression, and none
also included information regarding HER-2/neu overexpression. Majed et al reported that in a cohort of
14,709 patients treated at the Curie Institute over a
19-year period, there was a statistically significant interaction between obesity and distant recurrence for ERpositive compared with ER-negative disease (P ¼ .05),
although only about 30% of the population received
adjuvant chemotherapy, and not all patients with ERpositive disease received endocrine therapy.24 In contrast, de Azambuja et al reported worse outcomes for
5944

ER-positive compared with ER-negative disease, but
the interaction P values were not significant.25 Sestak
et al reported that in postmenopausal women with ERpositive disease enrolled in the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial, not only was
high baseline BMI associated with more distant recurrence, but also better outcomes were observed for adjuvant anastrozole compared with tamoxifen primarily in
women who were not obese.26
Obesity is known to be associated with more
comorbidities.27 However, the studies included in this
analysis required an excellent performance status and
normal cardiac, renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function, thereby excluding those with cardiovascular disease
or other comorbidities compromising normal organ
function or functional status. Moreover, by evaluating
BCSS, we confirmed that the inferior DFS and OS was
attributable to higher risk of breast cancer recurrence and
not solely to comorbidities.
An important consideration in interpreting this
work is that the relation between increasing BMI and
increased recurrence is biologically plausible for several
reasons. First, ER-positive breast cancer exhibits significantly higher gene expression of the insulin growth factor
pathway (eg, IRS1, IGFR1, IGFB2) and downstream elements, such as Ras pathway (RhoB, RhoC, RAB27B,
GGPS1) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
(MAPK3) pathway,28 and there is significant cross-talk
between the estrogen and insulin signaling pathways.29
Second, higher insulin levels, even within a normal physiologic range, have been associated with increased recurrence in operable breast cancer30,31; in addition, elevated
C-peptide levels are associated with increased risk of cancer-related death specifically in ER-positive breast cancer.31 Binding of insulin to the insulin receptor activates
the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways, and also actives
ER-alpha–mediated transcription. Finally, obesity is
known to be associated with hyperinsulinemia, and metabolic syndrome (characterized by central obesity and hyperinsulinemia) is known to be associated with increased
breast cancer recurrence.32 Although increased production of endogenous estrogens in obese women has been
postulated as a contributing factor, this has not been
confirmed.33,34
The results of this analysis clearly establish a relation
between higher BMI at the time of breast cancer diagnosis
and higher risk of recurrence and death, specifically in
hormone receptor-positive, HER-2–negative disease,
which accounts for about 2=3 of all breast cancers. What
remains uncertain, however, is whether dietary and
Cancer

lifestyle interventions resulting in weight loss after a breast
cancer diagnosis could substantially reduce the risk of recurrence, and also perhaps provide secondary benefits in
reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The
effect of dietary fat reduction in early stage breast cancer
has already been evaluated in 2 clinical trials, including
the WINS (Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study)35
and WHEL (Women’s Healthy Eating and Living) trials.36 Dietary fat reduction associated with modest average
weight loss of 6 pounds was associated with reduced recurrence in the WINS trial (HR, 0.76; P ¼ .034 for adjusted
Cox model analysis), but was not observed in the WHEL
trial, in which the dietary intervention did not produce
weight loss. The 25% reduction in the risk of recurrence
observed in the WINS trial is comparable to the treatment
effect associated with adjuvant chemotherapy.37 Other
studies have shown that significant weight loss may be
achieved with other dietary strategies, and was also
associated with comparable reduction in insulin levels,38
suggesting that patients may have several dietary options
that may be effective in reducing recurrence risk. Further
evaluation of dietary and lifestyle modification is
warranted.
