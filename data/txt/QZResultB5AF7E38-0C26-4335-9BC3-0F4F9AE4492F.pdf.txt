Abstract
ERBB receptor transmodulation by heterologous G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) generates functional
diversity in signal transduction. Tachykinins are neuropeptides and proinﬂammatory cytokines that promote cell
survival and cancer progression by activating several GPCRs. In this work, we found that the pain-associated
tachykinin Substance P (SP) contributes to persistent transmodulation of the ERBB receptors, EGFR and HER2, in
breast cancer, acting to enhance malignancy and therapeutic resistance. SP and its high-afﬁnity receptor NK-1R
were highly expressed in HER2þ primary breast tumors (relative to the luminal and triple-negative subtypes) and
were overall correlated with poor prognosis factors. In breast cancer cell lines and primary cultures derived from
breast cancer samples, we found that SP could activate HER2. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated attenuation of NK-1R, or its chemical inhibition, or suppression of overall GPCR-mediated signaling, all strongly
decreased steady-state expression of EGFR and HER2, establishing that their basal activity relied upon
transdirectional activation by GPCR. Thus, SP exposure affected cellular responses to anti-ERBB therapies. Our
work reveals an important oncogenic cooperation between NK-1R and HER2, thereby adding a novel link between
inﬂammation and cancer progression that may be targetable by SP antagonists that have been clinically explored.

Introduction
Inﬂammation is a hallmark of cancer (1). Chronic inﬂammation is closely related to tumor development and progression; it supplies the tumor with a milieu of proinﬂammatory
cytokines that can modulate the inﬂammation-related tumor
cell signaling (2, 3). Some inﬂammatory conditions increase the
risk of the onset of cancer by enhancing the proliferation and
oncogenic potential of adjacent epithelia. In cancers that are

already established, persistent inﬂammation enhances tumor
growth and progression by activating several mechanisms that
support tumors, such as enhanced angiogenesis and stromal
cell recruitment. Inﬂammatory mediators can also cause
genetic instability (4, 5) and favor the ﬁxation of epigenetic
alterations (6).
Several proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as chemokines,
induce signal transduction through different families of Gprotein coupled receptors (GPCR). Activation of secondary
messengers, such as PKC and adenylate cyclase, results in the
diversiﬁcation of G-protein signal transduction (7, 8). In some
cancer cell types, the mitogenic stimulus activated by Gproteins is partly mediated by transmodulation of the EGF
receptor (EGFR; refs. 9, 10). The members of the ERBB family,
including EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4, are receptors with
tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, and signaling networks triggered by them play a pivotal role in tumor initiation and
progression (11, 12). In particular, HER2 is overexpressed in
approximately 25% of the patients with breast cancer and is
associated with worse prognosis and lower survival rates (13,
14). The precise pathways interconnected with RTK to ﬁne
tune cellular responses are still unknown, but emerging evidence indicates that transmodulation by heterologous GPCRs
may play an important role in them (7, 8). It is particularly
noteworthy that the cross-talk between GPCRs and RTKs
allows for RTK activation even in the absence of ligands (7).

Transmodulation of HER2 by SP in Breast Cancer

Therefore, identifying new modulators of RTKs activity could
be highly useful in the search for new therapeutic targets.
In this work, we have investigated the transmodulation of
the ERBB system by the neuropeptide/proinﬂammatory
mediator Substance P (SP), a pleiotropic molecule synthesized by the TAC1 gene. SP is related to processes of
neurogenic inﬂammation, wound healing, hematopoiesis,
microvasculature permeability, leukocyte trafﬁcking, cell
survival, and metastatic dissemination (15–19). The three
classical members of the mammalian tachykinin family are
SP and neurokinin A (NKA), both encoded by the TAC1
gene, and neurokinin B (NKB) encoded by the TAC3 gene.
There is a third mammalian tachykinin gene (TAC4) that
codiﬁes for hemokinins and endokinins (15, 20, 21). These
tachykinins exercise their biologic functions through their
preferential binding to the tachykinin receptors NK-1R
(TACR1), NK-2R (TACR2), and NK-3R (TACR3), respectively,
although each tachykinin can bind to the three tachykinin
receptors with different afﬁnity (22). NK-1R, the high-afﬁnity
SP receptor, is a GPCR that is overexpressed in breast cancer
(19). In this work, we identify a new aberrant signaling
network in breast cancer based on the oncogenic cooperation between the tachykinergic system and HER2/EGFR
signaling. The data presented here support the idea that the
SP produced within a proinﬂammatory setting can enhance
tumor malignancy by activating HER2 and EGFR. In addition, we showed that the network could be exploited for the
development of new therapeutic strategies based on the dual
inhibition of activation and transactivation mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
All human breast cancer cell lines were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection and were validated by single
locus short tandem repeat typing (Bio-Synthesis, Inc.) before
its use.

in paraformaldehyde 4%, and resuspended in PBS with glycerol 10%. A cytospin slide centrifuge was used to concentrate
and ﬁx the samples on glass slides until further immunodetection of activated HER2.
In vivo experiments
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
regulations of our institution's ethics commission, following
the guidelines established by the regional authorities of Catalonia, Spain. The speciﬁc procedures are outlined in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods on line.
Western blot analysis
Brieﬂy, cells or tumor pieces were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Protein quantiﬁcation and
detection were conducted as described elsewhere, applying
the primary antibodies at the dilutions indicated in the Supplementary Materials and Methods online.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cell lines and cytospin slides containing the cells from the
primary cultures were immunostained with a combination of
different antibodies as explained in the Supplementary Materials and Methods online. The slides were counterstained with
40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Roche Diagnostic) for
15 minutes and mounted with a coverslip using ProLong
Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes).
Fluorescence microscopy and image acquisition
Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning
confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH).
In the images of the primary cultures, the mean ﬂuorescence
(pHER2 staining; integrated density/area) of selected cells
(those pan-CK positive) was quantiﬁed using a custom macro
in the FIJI software (a distribution of ImageJ-Wayne Rasband,
NIH) as explained in detail in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods online.

Isolation of human primary breast cancer cells
Nineteen histologically conﬁrmed breast cancer tumors
were collected at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain
under the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Tumor
tissue was processed to obtain single cells by digestion with
a mixture of collagenase and hyaluronidase, and the cells
were frozen in FBS with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide until further
analysis.

Tumor subtype classiﬁcation
Tumor subtype deﬁnitions in this study were as follows:
luminal A [estrogen receptor (ERþ) and/or progesterone
receptor (PRþ), HER2], luminal B (ERþ and/or PRþ,
HER2þ), HER2þ (ER, PR, HER2þ), basal-like (ER, PR,
HER2, CK5/6þ, and/or EGFRþ), and unclassiﬁed (negative
for all markers).

Time-course studies
In cell lines. To determine the effects of SP treatment on
HER2, EGFR, p42/44-MAPK, and Akt activation, cells were
treated at the indicated times with SP 100 nmol/L, washed, and
rapidly frozen until protein extraction.
In primary cultures. Tumor cells were thawed, ﬁltered to
ensure single-cell suspensions, and kept in Mammary Epithelial Basal Medium supplemented with growth factors for 3
hours at 37 C. Each single-cell suspension was split into 3
groups: control, SP 6 minutes, and SP 10 minutes. They were
serum starved for 2 hours, and then treated with PBS or SP 100
nmol/L at 37 C. After treatment, the cells were washed, ﬁxed

Immunohistochemistry procedure and evaluation
Immunohistochemistry for NK-1R, NK-2R, SP, COX2, or
smooth muscle actin (SMA) was conducted following standard
protocols as indicated in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods online. For the semiquantitative analysis, an immunoreactive score (IRS) was derived by multiplying the percentage of positive cells (PP) by the staining intensity (SI). The SI
was determined as: 0 for no staining; 1þ for weak staining; 2þ
for moderate staining; 3þ for strong staining, and 4þ for very
strong staining. We classiﬁed the IRS into 4 groups: 0 (negative
staining), 1 (staining score >0 and <100), 2 (staining score >100
and <200), and 3 (staining score >200).

Statistical analysis
Detailed statistic methods used to compare differences
between groups can be found in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods online.

Results
NK-1R and SP are highly expressed in human primary
tumors of the HER2þ subtype, and circulating SP levels
are increased in breast cancer patients
The expression levels of NK-1R, NK-2R, and SP were
scored as both continuous and ordinal variables (for further
details see Materials and Methods; Supplementary Tables S1
and S2), and both statistical analyses showed similar correlations with clinical characteristics. NK-1R, NK-2R, and SP
were expressed by luminal cells from normal breast tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S1), and overexpressed in tumors (Fig.
1A), in agreement with previous reports (19). In tumors, NK1R, NK-2R, and SP expression was detected in 94%, 86%, and
52% of the 318 samples analyzed, respectively (Fig. 1A–C).
With few exceptions, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant intratumor

heterogeneity for the expression of these proteins; when
present, they were expressed in the majority of the cells
within each tumor. Expression of either NK-1R or SP was
positively associated with tumor histopathologic characteristics related to poor prognosis. For example, NK-1R expression levels were associated with ER and PR negativity, and
p53 overexpression. SP expression was associated with a
high histologic grade, ER and PR negativity, and a high Ki67
proliferation index. In contrast, NK-2R expression was associated with low histologic grade, ER and PR positivity, and
no p53 overexpression (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Interestingly, we found that NK-1R and SP expression were
signiﬁcantly higher in tumors of the HER2þ subtype, when
the expression levels were considered as either continuous
or ordinal variables (Fig. 1D–I), and the same positive
association was found in tumors with HER2 gene ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). In contrast, NK-2R
expression was lowest in this particular tumor subtype (Fig.
1E and H).
We next determined the SP concentration in the serum of
139 breast cancer patients and 92 healthy controls by ELISA.

lines. Tubulin was used to ensure the equal protein loading. The quantiﬁcation of the blots is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.

The levels of SP were signiﬁcantly higher in patients with breast
cancer than in healthy controls, although we did not observe
any association with a particular tumor subtype or any other
clinicopathologic characteristic (Fig. 1J and Supplementary
Table S3).
Human tachykinins modulate EGFR and HER2 activation
in breast cancer cells
Considering that the higher expression of NK-1R and SP in
HER2þ tumors could be the consequence of functional cooperation between the two signaling systems, we next explored

the effects of SP on a panel of breast cancer cell lines with
(MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3, BT-474) and without (MDA-MB-231,
MCF7) ampliﬁcation or overexpression of the ERBB2 gene (23),
and with overexpression of the EGFR gene (MDA-MB-468;
Fig. 2A). We detected expression of the three main tachykinin
receptors, TACR1, TACR2, and TACR3, and expression of TAC1
(which codiﬁes for SP) by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in all the
cell lines (Fig. 2B). We further conﬁrmed the expression of NK1R and SP by immunoﬂuorescence in all the cell lines (Fig. 2C).
Through time-course studies, we observed that SP quickly
induced the phosphorylation of HER2 Tyr1248 (speciﬁc

tyrosine residue that serves as docking site for the adaptor
molecules that will activate the Ras-ERK pathways; refs. 24–26)
within the ﬁrst 6 to 10 minutes after stimulation in all the cell
lines (Fig. 2D; the densitometric quantiﬁcation is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2A). The activation of HER2 within this
time frame was consistently observed in all the replicates
conducted, although the exact time point of maximum activation varied. The kinetics of HER2 activation was dose
dependent, showing faster activation with increasing concentrations of SP (Supplementary Fig. S3). SP treatment also
induced the phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr1068 (ligand activated; ref. 27) and EGFR Tyr845 (Src activated; ref. 28), as well as
the p42/44-MAPK and Akt pathways (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
By immunoﬂuorescence, we also observed an increase in the
levels of phospho-HER2 Y1248 in the cell membrane of MDAMB-453 cells (HER2þ) and an increase in the formation of
endocytic vesicles containing activated EGFR in the MDA-MB468 cell line (EGFRþ; Supplementary Fig. S2B; ref. 29) after SP
treatment.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a common
downstream pathway triggered by both HER2 and NK-1R
activation (7, 30, 31). Then, to conﬁrm that the phosphorylation

of HER2 caused by SP treatment was indeed activating HER2,
we determined the capability of SP to activate the MAPK
pathway in the presence of HER2 inhibitors. Using the
MDA-MB-453 cell line, we observed that the inhibition of HER2
with either lapatinib or AG825 decreased the capability of SP to
activate the p42/44-MAPK (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B),
suggesting that the activation of MAPK by SP partially depends
on the transactivation of HER2.
SP transactivates HER2 in human primary tumor cells
Because HER2 is a target for therapy in patients with breast
cancer, we next studied the clinical relevance of SP-mediated
HER2 activation. We determined the activation of phosphoHER2 Y1248 after SP treatment for 6 and 10 minutes in 1896
single cells obtained from 19 breast cancer primary cultures of
different cancer subtypes that were classiﬁed by immunohistochemistry as having some degree of expression of HER2
(Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S4). We used
multicolor immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy
to analyze and quantify the levels of phospho-HER2 Y1248 in
pan-cytokeratin–positive cells (to select only epithelial cells;
Fig. 3A). The basal levels of phospho-HER2 Y1248 were higher
in the control samples derived from HER2þ and luminal B

tumors than in the luminal A or triple-negative tumors (Fig. 3B
and C). Although overall we only observed a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in phosho-HER2 Y1248 by SP in cells
derived from tumors of the HER2þ and triple-negative subtypes (Fig. 3D), there was some intergroup variation in the
tumors of the luminal A subtype. In fact, in 7 out of 10 luminal A
tumors, SP activated HER2, in agreement with the results
obtained with breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S6). We did not observe activation of HER2 in the cells derived
from luminal B tumors at the time points tested. There could
be several reasons for the lack of HER2 activation in this
subgroup; for instance, due to low levels of NK-1R expression
in luminal B compared with HER2þ tumors (Fig. 1D) or
because of a lack of additional signaling mediators involved
in the transactivation process with differential intracellular
signaling.

SP/NK-1R autocrine/paracrine signaling in breast
cancer cells elicits a constitutive transactivation of HER2
and EGFRs
Because NK-1R is the high-afﬁnity receptor for SP, we next
decided to investigate its contribution to SP-mediated HER2
transactivation. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was transfected
with the pcDNA3.1(þ)-TACR1 vector, enriched with NK-1Rþ
cells by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (Supplementary
Fig. S7A), and the expression of NK-1R conﬁrmed by qPCR
(Supplementary Fig. S7B). Upon SP stimulation, the levels of
pHER2 Y1248 and p-p42/44-MAPK were signiﬁcantly
increased in the cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(þ)-TACR1
compared with mock cells (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig.
S7C), indicating that NK-1R is involved in SP-induced HER2
transactivation. The inhibition of TACR1 by siRNA in the SKBR-3 and BT-474 cell lines caused a signiﬁcant decrease in

the basal levels of pHER2 (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this
ﬁnding, the inhibition of NK-1R activity by the chemical
inhibitor L-733,060 for 24 hours markedly reduced pHER2
Y1248 in the SK-BR-3, BT-474, and MDA-MB-453 cells and
pEGFR Y1068 in the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Fig. 4C). This
suggests that tumor cell oncogene addiction to NK-1R could
rely in part on NK-1R–mediated effects on HER2 and EGFR
basal activity. We also observed that signal transduction
through phospho-p42/44-MAPK in BT-474 and/or phosphoAkt in SK-BR-3, BT-474, and MDA-MB-468 was also inhibited
in cells treated with L-733,060 (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the
blockade of NK-1R, NK-2R, and NK-3R in the SKBR3 cell
line caused almost a complete inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation and a signiﬁcant decrease in the Akt survival signaling pathway (Fig. 4D), thereby further conﬁrming the
tachykinergic system to be a modulator of the steady state
(or basal activation) of HER2.
Besides the well-known role of several GPCR ligands as
activators of EGFR and HER2 (7, 9, 32), their contribution to
the basal activity of RTKs has not been intensely studied. For
this reason, we next determined whether GPCR-mediated
signaling modulates the activity of HER2 in breast cancer cells.
We observed that the inhibition of pertussis toxin-sensitive Gproteins strongly decreased the pHER2 Y1248 in all the cell
lines, and total HER2 in the SK-BR-3 and BT474 cells. In some
cases, a decrease in p42/44-MAPK and Akt was also observed
(Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S7D). All together these data
suggest that G-protein signaling in breast cancer cells directly
modulates HER2 activation.
Chronic overexposure to SP in vivo has mitogenic activity
and enhances HER2 activation
To further study the effects of overexposure to SP on
tumor growth in vivo, we subcutaneously implanted mini
osmotic pumps challenged to continuously deliver 500
nmol/L of SP for 28 days in severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID) mice wearing MDA-MB-231 (HER2) or
MDA-MB-453–derived (HER2þ) xenograft tumors. We aimed
to determine whether long-term SP exposure, simulating a
scenario of chronic inﬂammation, could favor the outgrowth
of tumor cells with different properties and thus inﬂuence
the progression of tumors with different phenotype: HER2
or HER2þ.
Chronic SP delivery for 28 days did not affect the tumor
growth or the ﬁnal tumor weight in any of the tumor models
(Fig. 5A and B). However, we observed a signiﬁcant increase of
total HER2 in the SP-treated tumors by Western blot analysis
in both models (Fig. 5C) and by immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 5D) in the MDA-MB-453. In the MDA-MB-231–derived
xenografts, we also detected a weak expression of HER2 in the
treated tumors, compared with the control tumors that were
totally negative. The MAPK pathway was also highly
expressed in the MDA-MB-231 SP-treated tumors. In addition,
in both tumor models, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the
number of mitotic bodies (Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B)
probably due to the known mitogenic activity of SP (33, 34).
These data suggest that the continuous presence of SP in a
tumor, like in a situation of chronic inﬂammation, could

6430

enhance the expression of HER2 in tumor cells with different
phenotypes.
The NK-1R antagonist L-733,060 inhibits tumor growth
in vivo in HER2- and EGFR-expressing tumors
We next decided to study the effects of NK-1R inhibition on
the in vivo growth of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453
(HER2þ), MDA-MB-468 (EGFRþ), and MDA-MB-231 (HER2
and EGFR). The tumor growth was signiﬁcantly decreased
only in MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468–derived xenograft
tumors treated with L-733,060 (5 mg/kg three times
weekly; Fig. 5E and F), but not in the MDA-MB-231 tumors
(Fig. 5G), suggesting that the antitumor effects of NK-1R
inhibition in vivo depend on the modulatory properties of
NK-1R signaling on HER2 and EGFR activity. Final tumor
weight was signiﬁcantly reduced by L-733,060 only in the
HER2þ model derived from MDA-MB-453, and slightly
decreased in the MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 5H and I). On the
other hand, we did not observe signiﬁcant effect on the growth
or ﬁnal tumor weight of the MDA-MB-231–derived tumors
(Fig. 5G and J). At the protein level, there were no signiﬁcant
differences in HER2 or EGFR, suggesting that NK-1R inhibition does not select for particular cell subpopulations, and the
treatment with L-733,060 only decreased p42/44-MAPK and
Akt in the MDA-MB-231–derived tumors (Fig. 5K–M). In
addition, we noticed a slight decrease in the expression of
the COX2 proinﬂammatory mediator as a consequence of NK1R inhibition in all the tumor models, and a signiﬁcant
decrease in a-SMA–positive cells, suggesting that the blockade of NK-1R modulates both tumor and stromal properties
(Supplementary Fig. S9A–S9C).
Chronic SP treatment alters cellular responses to
therapies targeting HER2 and EGFR
Because the hyperactivation of ERBB signaling by proinﬂammatory components may inﬂuence cellular responses to
targeted therapies, we next studied the effects of short or
chronic exposure to SP on the cellular responses to HER2 and
EGFR inhibitors in the MDA-MB-453 (HER2þ) or MDA-MB-468
(EGFRþ) cell lines. To develop a model of SP overexposure, we
kept the different cell lines growing in the absence (control
group) or presence of SP (100 nmol/L daily) for over 5 months.
The cell lines chronically treated with SP showed increased
levels of total and activated HER2 and EGFR, and in some cases
a higher activation of the p42/44-MAPK and Akt pathways
(Supplementary Fig. S10A–S10D).
Next, we studied the changes in IC50 values for the EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478, the HER2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitor AG825, and the dual EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitor lapatinib upon acute (72 hours) or chronic (5
months) SP treatment. A short exposure to 100 or 500
nmol/L of SP had little or no effect on the IC50 value in
any cell line, whereas only the response of the MDA-MB-453
cells to AG825 upon addition of 100 nmol/L SP and that of
the MDA-MB-468 cells to AG1478 upon 500 nmol/L SP
stimulation were signiﬁcantly affected (Fig. 6A and B and
Supplementary Table S5). However, chronic treatment with
SP for up to 5 months induced a signiﬁcant increase in the

chronic exposure to SP affects the response to EGFR and
HER2-targeted therapies.
Combination of the NK-1R antagonist L-733,060 with
anti-HER2 therapies synergistically inhibits the

We next used MTT assays and applied combination index
(CI) equations (35) to determine whether the inhibition of NK1R activity could enhance the effects of EGFR or HER2 inhibitors. Treatment with L-733,060 synergized with the cytotoxic
effects of AG825 (CI ¼ 0.5686) and lapatinib (CI ¼ 0.653) in the
MDA-MB-453 cell line and also with lapatinib in the MDA-MB468 cells (CI ¼ 0.4494), although the combination of L-733,060
with AG1478 (CI ¼ 1.7642) in the MDA-MB-468 cell line
indicated an antagonist effect at the doses used (Fig. 6C and
Supplementary Table S5). These results strongly support the
idea that the modulatory properties of NK-1R on ERBB receptors could be exploited to increase the effectiveness of targeted
therapies for the treatment of breast cancer by concomitant
inhibition of NK-1R and ERBB receptors.

Although the oncogenic addiction to HER2 signaling is
therapeutically exploited for breast cancer treatment, the
disappointing clinical responses observed in a signiﬁcant
percentage of patients suggest that additional mechanisms
regulating the HER2 pathway may be used to ﬁne tune the
cancer cell responses to anti-HER2 therapies. The work presented here highlights a previously unidentiﬁed role of SP/NK1R autocrine/paracrine constitutive signaling as a modulator
of the basal activation of HER2 and EGFR in breast cancer—a
mechanism with several clinical implications.
The transmodulation of RTKs by SP and other neuropeptides and proinﬂammatory mediators (36, 37) can serve as a
mechanism for RTK activation in a ligand-independent way
(7). The fact that the steady states of HER2 and EGFR depend
upon the activity of additional signaling pathways implies
that these instigator pathways could be therapeutically used
to downregulate the activation of RTKs. For example, our
laboratory has previously shown that SP inhibition decreases
EGFR and HER2 activity and induces apoptosis, and that SP
blockade is effective in inducing cell death even in cell lines
that are resistant to the EGFR/HER2 inhibitors lapatinib and
trastuzumab (17). Likewise, in this work we have shown that
the chemical inhibition of NK-1R, alone or in combination
with the inhibition of NK-2R and NK-3R, or the silencing of
TACR1 gene by siRNA strongly decreases HER2 activity in all
the cell lines studied, as well as the NK-1R antagonist L733,060 reduces tumor growth in SCID mice harboring
HER2þ or EGFRþ tumor cells. Although we did not reach
high levels of TACR1 inhibition to avoid the effects of
massive cell death, even TACR1 gene silencing by 50% to
70% showed effects on the steady state of HER2, and given
the diversity of GPCRs expression in cancer cells, it is
probable that this ﬁnding may be applied to a huge variety
of ligands. It should be noted that a vast number of receptors

Transmodulation of HER2 by SP in Breast Cancer

involved in tumor progression, such as some cytokine and
chemokine receptors, fall into the category of GPCRs, implying that steady G-protein activation is always present in
cancer cells. In this context, we observed that the inhibition of Gprotein–mediated signaling decreases HER2 activity and expression, supporting the idea that the dual blockade of activation
and transactivation pathways could enhance the therapeutic
response to particular targeted therapies. Our results also imply
that the lack of target dependency in some anti-HER2 therapies
could be due, in part, to NK-1R transactivation mechanisms in
those tumors that express the NK-1R receptor. In fact, we
observed that an overexposure to SP in vivo increases HER2
expression in HER2þ or HER2 xenograft tumors and that this
could be a relevant ﬁnding to consider in relation to those
tumors initially classiﬁed as HER2 negative; the constant signaling of SP in tumor cells could favor a long-term selection of
cells with increased levels of HER2. Although in our model, we
did not observe an increase in tumor volume despite HER2
increase, it is likely that in a longer period of time, this constant
activation of HER2 would translate in increased tumor volume,
as it can be expected from situations of chronic inﬂammation in
humans. Furthermore, in vitro experiments show that chronic
exposure to SP also increases HER2 and/or EGFR expression
and activation in the cell lines studied. Moreover, NK-1R inhibition synergizes with anti-EGFR and anti-HER2 therapies
thereby signiﬁcantly reducing cell survival.
The modulation of RTK activation by NK-1R also suggests
oncogenic cooperation between these two types of receptors
during tumor progression. As we observed in human primary tumors, NK-1R and SP are highly expressed in those of
the HER2þ subtype, and SP can activate HER2 in primary
cultures derived from human tumors with and without
HER2 overexpression. In addition to HER2 overexpression,
our current results identify NK-1R and SP as two new
markers associated with other clinicopathologic characteristics related to a poor prognosis such as p53 overexpression,
ER negativity expression, high proliferation, and a high
histologic grade (38, 39).
In addition, the relevance of SP signaling in breast cancer
could be context dependent. For instance, the speciﬁcity of
NK-1R signal transduction depends on the formation of
scaffolding protein complexes after its activation (40). In
fact, the coexpression of EGFR and/or HER2 in the same
cancer cell could provide SP with additional signal transduction adaptors, thus diversifying its effects. In a similar
way, the apoptotic effects of NK-1R inhibition could depend
on its ability to block the oncogenic dependence on HER2
and EGFR, as we observed in vivo where only HER2þ or
EGFRþ tumors were affected after NK-1R inhibition. Moreover, as we showed in this work, not all SP receptors are
related to the activation of the same tumor-promoting
mechanism; for example, NK-2R receptor showed a correlation with ER- and PR-positive tumors in contrast with NK-

1R, which is associated with ER- and PR-negative tumors.
Finally, SP activation of the MAPK pathway has been shown
to be RTK dependent (40) or independent (41), suggesting a
cell-type–speciﬁc modulation of SP signaling.
In conclusion, the results presented here imply another
mechanism by which inﬂammation, via SP, could enhance
tumor aggressiveness. Furthermore, the interplay between
multiple signaling pathways, such as those controlled by the
receptors NK-1R and HER2, implies that to achieve a complete
therapeutic response with therapies designed to target RTK,
both mechanisms (activation and transactivation) may be
inhibited, as we have shown for NK-1R and HER2 in the present
work.
