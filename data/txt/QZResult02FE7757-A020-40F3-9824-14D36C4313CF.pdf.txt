ABSTRACT
Notch signalling is aberrantly activated in human non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Nevertheless, the prognostic roles of mRNA expression of four Notch
receptors in NSCLC patients remain elusive. In this report, we reported the prognostic
roles of Notch receptors in a total of 1,926 NSCLC patients through “The KaplanMeier plotter” (KM plotter) database which is capable to assess the effect of 22,277
genes on survival of NSCLC patients. We found that mRNA high expression level
of Notch1 was associated with better overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC patients,
hazard ratio (HR) 0.78 (0.69-0.89), p=0.00019, better OS in adenocarcinoma (Ade)
patients, HR 0.59 (0.46-0.75), p=1.5e-05, as well as in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
patients, HR 0.78 (0.62-0.99), p=0.044. mRNA high expression levels of Notch2 and
Notch3 were associated with worsen OS for all NSCLC patients, as well as in Ade,
but not in SCC patients. mRNA high expression level of Notch4 was not found to be
associated with to OS for all NSCLC patients. In addition, mRNA high expression levels
of Notch2, Notch3, but Notch4 are significantly associated with the NSCLC patients
who have different smoking status. Our results indicate that mRNA expression of
Notch receptors may have distinct prognostic values in NSCLC patients. These results
will benefit for developing tools to accurately predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients.

The Notch signaling pathway, an evolutionarily
conserved and complex signaling system is known to
regulate epithelial cell and stem cell homeostasis [5–6].
Notch signalling is aberrantly activated in several human
tumors including breast, colon, cervical, pancreatic, head
and neck, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, Large-cell and
Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as NSCLC [7–10]. Previous
reports demonstrate that Notch signaling is activated and
plays a critical role in NSCLC initiation, progression, and
metastasis of NSCLC [10–13]. However, the prognostic
values of mRNA expression of Notch receptors in NSCLC
patients have not been determined. In this report, we
determined the prognostic roles of mRNA expression of
four Notch receptors in NSCLC patients.

INTRODUCTION
Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancerrelated death worldwide, and among this carcinoma,
non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) comprises the
majority of cases [1–2]. NSCLC includes: adenocarcinoma
(Ade), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), two major
histological types. In spite of the progresses in early
diagnosis, radical cure treatment, and molecular targeted
therapies, the majority of NSCLC patients present with
advanced stage disease and recur in about one third of
individuals [3–4]. Therefore, it is still needed to further
investigate the molecular mechanism of initiation,
development and to identify potential prognostic markers
and potential drug targets of NSCLC.

database was widely used in many studies [14–22]. A
number of genes, as prognostic markers or potential drug
targets have been reported by using KM plotter in ovarian
cancer [23–24], breast cancer [25–33], gastric cancer [21,
34], as well as in NSCLC [35]. In this report, we used KM
plotter database and determined the prognostic roles of
mRNA expression of Notch receptors in NSCLC patients.

Figure 3 demonstrates the prognostic value of
Notch3 in the database. The Affymetrix IDs is valid:
203237_at (Notch3). Notch3 mRNA high expression was
significantly correlated to worsen OS for all patients, HR
1.19 (1.05-1.36), p=0.006 (Figure 3A) and Ade patients,
HR 1.82 (1.44-2.3), p=4e-07 (Figure 3B), but not SCC
patients, HR 0.95 (0.75-1.2), p=0.66 (Figure 3C).
Figure 4 demonstrates the prognostic value of
Notch4 in the database. The Affymetrix IDs is valid:
205247_at (Notch4). Notch4 mRNA high expression was
not significantly correlated to OS for all NSCLC patients,
HR1.02 (0.9-1.16), p=0.72 (Figure 4A), Ade patients, HR
1.16 (0.92-1.47), p=0.2 (Figure 4B), as well as patients
with SCC, HR 0.92 (0.72-1.17), p=0.49 (Figure 4C).
For further assess the association of Notch receptors
with other clinicopathological profiles, we determined
the correlation with the patients' smoking status (Table
1), clinical different stages (Table 2) and different
chemotherapeutic treatment (Table 3). As from Table 1,
Notch2, Notch3, but Notch4 are significantly correlated
with the smoking status. Notch 1 only significantly
associated with smoked NSCLC patients. From Table
2, Notch1 and Notch2 are significantly correlated with
clinical stage I & II of the patients. Notch 3 is only
significantly associated with clinical stage I of NSCLC
patients. From Table 3, only Notch3 is significantly
correlated with the patients without chemotherapy.

RESULTS
It is well known that Notch signaling have four
receptors, Notch1~4. All Notch receptors can be found in
the database (www.kmplot.com).
We used KM plotter and determined theprognostic
value of Notch1 in the database. The Affymetrix IDs is
valid: 218902_at (Notch1). Survival curves are drafted
for all NSCLC patients (n=1,926) (Figure 1A), for Ade
patients (n =720) (Figure 1B), and for SCC patients (n
=524) (Figure 1C). Notch1 mRNA high expression was
correlated to better overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC
patients who were followed for 20 years, hazard ratio
(HR) 0.78 (0.69-0.89), p=0.00019. Notch1 mRNA
high expression was also correlated to better OS in Ade
patients, HR 0.59 (0.46-0.75), p=1.5e-05, as well as in
SCC patients, HR 0.78 (0.62-0.99), p=0.044.
We next determined the prognostic value of Notch2
in the database. The Affymetrix IDs is valid: 210756_s_at
(Notch2). Notch2 mRNA high expression was significantly
correlated to worsen OS for all patients, HR 1.29 (1.131.46), p=9.1e-05 (Figure 2A). Notch2 mRNA high
expression was also correlated to worsen OS in Ade
patients, HR 2.2 (1.72-2.81), p=9.2e-11 (Figure 2B), but
not in SCC patients, HR 1 (0.79-1.26), p=0.99 (Figure 2C).

DISCUSSION
KM plotter was initially formed to access the
prognostic value of an individual gene using online
database in breast cancer patients [36–37]. A number

of genes, such as ABCC2, BUBR1, CCND2, CCND3,
CCNDE2, GREB1, MKI67, TK2, CDKN1A, TOP2A
and TOP2B used this tool to validate or confirm the
prognostic power in breast cancer [25–31, 38] and/or lung
cancer [35]. In addition, several proteins were identified
by KM plotter as potential drug targets, such as S100P
[29], carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) [32], Notch1 [39] in
breast cancer, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) [40] in
NSCLC, Notch2 [24] in ovarian cancer.
Notch1, among four Notch receptors, is the best
studied in NSCLC carcinogenesis [41–44]. Increased
frequency of Notch1 activation can induce lung adenoma
formation and enable progression to Ade and metastases
[45]. Notch1 activation can also enhance epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells [46–
47]. Cisplatin was also observed to activate Notch1 first,
then further induce the enrichment of CD133 positive
cells in lung Ade [48]. Notch1 function was found to be
required for tumor initiation through suppression of p53mediated apoptosis in NSCLC [49]. But recently, Wael et
al observed that Notch1 expression has a tumor inhibitory
effect on Ade cells, but not SCC cells in NSCLC [50].
A meta-analysis showed that Notch1 was correlated with
lymph node metastasis, TNM stages and significantly poor
OS in NSCLC patients [51]. Notch1 mRNA was expressed
on both mesenchymal and epithelial structures of the
embryonic lung, indicating that Notch1 has a role in the
vascular morphogenesis and lung development [52]. In our
report, mRNA high expression of Notch1 was correlated

to better OS for all NSCLC patients, also better OS in Ade
and SCC patients.
Notch2 is a tumor suppressor in lung carcinogenesis
[53]. But, the prognostic significance of either Notch2
protein or mRNA in NSCLC patients is not known. In our
report, mRNA high expression of Notch2 was significantly
correlated to worsen OS for all NSCLC patients, HR 1.29
(1.13-1.46), p=9.1e-05. Notch2 mRNA high expression
was also correlated to worsen OS in Ade patients, HR
2.2 (1.72-2.81), p=9.2e-11, but not in SCC patients, HR 1
(0.79-1.26), p=0.99.
Notch3 potentially contributes to the multistep
evolution of lung cancer in airway epithelium by using
a transgenic mouse model [54]. High Notch3 expression
may contribute the resistance to chemotherapy in lung
cancer patients [55]. Notch3 was found to upregulate
ZEB-1, which leads to TGF-β-induced the EMT and bone
metastasis in NSCLC [56]. A report showed that Notch3
was an independent prognostic factor for patients with
NSCLC [57]. In consistent with previous report, our
results showed that mRNA high expression of Notch3 was
found to be significantly correlated to worsen OS for all
NSCLC patients, HR 1.19 (1.05-1.36), p=0.006 and Ade
patients, HR 1.82 (1.44-2.3), p=4e-07, but not patients
with SCC, HR 0.95 (0.75-1.2), p=0.66.
Notch4 is an oncogene in mammary tumor [58–
59]. Notch4 was able to expended the tumorigenicity
in mammary epithelial cells [60–61]. Although Notch4
was detected in both tumor and stromal compartments

of NSCLC [62], the significance of Notch4 in NSCLC
needs to be further determined. In this report, mRNA high
expression of Notch4 was not significantly correlated to
OS for all NSCLC patients, Ade patients, as well as SCC
patients.
Nicotine can deregulate essential biological activities
such as the cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration,
invasion, inflammation, cell-mediated immunity and
angiogenesis [63]. Nicotine might be promoting NSCLC
growth and metastasis by inducing the secretion of stem
cell factor [64]. There is no report regarding whether
there is a direct correlation between nicotine and Notch
activation in NSCLC. However, Hirata et al [65] reported
that nicotine can increase ALDH-positive cells through a
PKC-Notch pathway in MCF-7 cells. In addition, nicotine
may impact specific Notch members in endothelial
cells [66] or dendritic cells [67], thus indirectly impact
NSCLC. Nicotine was also reported recently to enhance
the expression of synaptic and Notch1 proteins in stressed
animals [68]. In this report, we observed that high mRNA
expression of Notch2, Notch3, but Notch4 are correlated
with smoking status of NSCLC patients. High mRNA
expression of Notch 1 is only significantly associated with
smoked NSCLC patients.
Previous results suggest that Notch signaling,
especially Notch receptors may be essential drug target
for NSCLC patients. γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT was
demonstrated to inhibit Notch activation and cell growth
in NSCLC cells [69]. However, γ-secretase inhibitors are
not able to distinguish individual Notch receptors and may
cause intestinal toxicity [70] by inhibiting other signaling
pathways [71]. Recently, phage display technology may
produce highly specialized antibodies which can recognize
each Notch receptor paralogue in human patients and
rodent models [72]. Based on our study that mRNA high
expression of Notch2 and Notch3 was correlated to worsen
OS for all NSCLC patients, thus Notch2 and Notch3 might
be potential drug targets for NSCLC patients.
In summary, we demonstrated that Notch1 mRNA
high expression was correlated to better OS for all NSCLC
patients. Notch2 and Notch3 mRNA high expression
were correlated to worsen OS for all NSCLC patients.
Notch4 mRNA high expression were not correlated to
OS for all NSCLC patients. These results will be useful
for better understand the complexity and heterogeneity
in the molecular biology of NSCLC and to develop tools
to more accurately predict their prognosis. Based on our
study, Notch2 and Notch3 might be potential drug targets
for NSCLC patients.

using gene expression data and survival information
of 1,928 NSCLC patients downloaded from above
three datasets. The NSCLC patients were followed up
20 years. By using KM plotter, four Notch receptors
(Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4) were entered
into the database (http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.

survival plots in which the number-at-risk is indicated
below the main plot. The certain gene mRNA expression
above or below the median separates the cases into high
expression and low expression. Hazard ratio (and 95%
confidence intervals) and log rank P were calculated and
displayed on the webpage.
