Abstract
Two cytidine analogues, gemcitabine (dFdC) and 1-B-Darabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC), show significant therapeutic
effect in a variety of cancers. However, response to these drugs
varies widely. Evidence from tumor biopsy samples shows that
expression levels for genes involved in the cytidine transport,
metabolism, and bioactivation pathway contribute to this
variation in response. In the present study, we set out to test
the hypothesis that variation in gene expression both within
and outside of this ‘‘pathway’’ might influence sensitivity to
gemcitabine and AraC. Specifically, Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0
GeneChip and cytotoxicity assays were performed to obtain
basal mRNA expression and IC50 values for both drugs in 197
ethnically defined Human Variation Panel lymphoblastoid cell
lines. Genes with a high degree of association with IC50 values
were involved mainly in cell death, cancer, cell cycle, and
nucleic acid metabolism pathways. We validated selected
significant genes by performing real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR and selected two representative candidates,
NT5C3 (within the pathway) and FKBP5 (outside of the
pathway), for functional validation. Those studies showed
that down-regulation of NT5C3 and FKBP5 altered tumor cell
sensitivity to both drugs. Our results suggest that cell-based
model system studies, when combined with complementary
functional characterization, may help to identify biomarkers
for response to chemotherapy with these cytidine analogues.

Introduction
Studies of gene expression may make it possible to identify
biomarkers that will help predict clinical response to antineoplastic
drug therapy. Many of these drugs have narrow therapeutic
indexes. Therefore, it is crucial to identify biomarkers that might
help to maximize efficacy and minimize drug-related toxicity. Most
previous studies have focused on the relationship of expression
signatures in tumor tissue to therapeutic response (1–3). However,
individual variation in expression patterns controlled by germline
DNA can also play an important role in response. Genes encoding
proteins involved in drug transport, metabolism, activation,
deactivation, or drug targets and downstream signaling pathways
could all potentially influence drug response phenotypes (4). To

test the hypothesis that variation in basal gene expression might
affect sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy, we have used a
Human Variation Panel lymphoblastoid cell line model system
consisting of 197 cell lines for which we obtained gene expression
data using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips and drug-related
cytotoxicity phenotypes. Although their expression profiles are
not identical with those of tumor cells, these cell lines provide
an opportunity to query the effect on drug response of common
variation across the genome, providing data that cannot be
obtained with other model systems such as the NCI-60 cell lines.
Therefore, these Human Variation Panel cell lines can serve as an
initial screen to identify candidate genes for which variation in
expression might contribute to variation in drug response
phenotypes.
We used two cytidine analogues, gemcitabine (dFdC) and 1-h-Darabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC), to determine whether individual
variation in basal gene expression might influence drug sensitivity.
These drugs have been used to treat many cancers, and they share
similar chemical structures, metabolic pathways, and mechanisms
of action (5–8). Both are prodrugs that must be transported into
cells, activated by kinases to form active diphosphorylated and
triphosphorylated metabolites, and inactivated by dephosphorylation. Seventeen genes are involved in this cytidine analogue
‘‘pathway’’ (Supplementary Table S1). The triphosphates, AraCTP
and dFdCTP, can be incorporated into DNA, terminating DNA
synthesis (8, 9). dFdCDP can also inhibit ribonucleotide reductases,
enzymes that catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to
deoxyribonucleotidase (10, 11).
Gemcitabine is used to treat solid tumors (6, 12), whereas AraC
is a major component of the therapy of acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; refs. 6, 7, 13). Clinical response to both drugs varies
widely (8, 14, 15). Most previous studies have focused on variation
in the expression of genes within the known cytidine analogue
metabolism and activation pathway (1, 16, 17). However, very little
information is available with regard to genes outside of that
pathway. Therefore, we have used these lymphoblastoid cell lines to
explore the possible contribution of individual variation in basal
gene expression to gemcitabine and AraC sensitivity.
Specifically, drug cytotoxicity and basal expression array data
were obtained for 197 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Selected genes
significantly associated with cytotoxicity were then validated
functionally. A series of functional analyses were performed for
two candidate genes, NT5C3, within the cytidine analogue pathway,
and FKBP5, outside of that pathway. Specific siRNA ‘‘knockdown’’
confirmed the results of the association study, and the functional
effects of both genes on response to gemcitabine and AraC was
explored. Therefore, the use of these cell lines to identify
pharmacogenomic candidate genes for cytidine analogue cytotoxicity resulted in novel hypotheses that can now be tested in clinical
translational studies.

Cytidine Cytotoxicity and Genome-Wide Expression

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from 60 Caucasian-American,
54 African-American, 60 Han Chinese-American, and 23 Centre d’ Etude du
Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH; Caucasian-American) unrelated subjects
were purchased from the Coriell Institute. Human SU86 pancreatic cancer
cells were a gift from Dr. Daniel D. Billadeau, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.
Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection.
Drugs and cell proliferation assays. AraC was purchased from SigmaAldrich, and gemcitabine was provided by Eli Lilly. Drugs were dissolved
in DMSO and were frozen at 20jC. Assays were performed in triplicate
at each drug concentration using the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega Corporation) in 96-well plates
(Corning) at a density of 5  104 cells per well. One hour after plating,
10 AL of gemcitabine (0.1 nmol/L–1 mmol/L) or AraC (1 nmol/L–
10 mmol/L) was added to the wells, and plates were read in a Safire2
microplate reader (Tecan AG) after 72-h incubations. Twelve randomly
selected lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to repeat the cytotoxicity
studies 3 mo later. Human tumor cell line cytotoxicity was determined in
a similar fashion except the cells were incubated overnight before the
addition of drug.
Expression array data. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy
Mini kits (QIAGEN, Inc.). RNA quality was tested using an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer, followed by hybridization to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. Only 26,653 probe sets that could be verified using the RefSeq RNA
database were used in our analyses.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed with the 1-step,
Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR kit (Stratagene) using primers purchased
from Qiagen. All experiments were performed in triplicate, with h-actin as
an internal control. Reverse transcribed Universal Human reference RNA
(Stratagene) was used to generate a standard curve.
Transient transfection and RNA interference. Human breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 and SU86 pancreatic cancer cell lines were used to perform

siRNA studies. Cells were grown to 30% to 50% confluence in 6-well plates,
and lipofectamine RNAMAX reagent (Invitrogen) was used to perform the
transfections.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed with lysates
from cells transiently expressing siRNA 48 h after transfection with control,
NT5C3, FKBP5, NT5C2, or FKBP1A siRNA. Specifically, 30 Ag of protein was
subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were incubated
overnight at 4jC with primary antibodies, followed by the secondary
antibody. Bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Antibodies were obtained from GenWay Biotech, Abcam, and Novus
Biologicals.
Intracellular gemcitabine and AraC metabolites. High performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure intracellular AraCDP,
AraCTP, dFdCDP, and dFdCTP concentrations. Nucleotide extracts were
prepared with a modification of the method of Van Haperen and colleagues
(18) after treatment for 8 h with the average IC50 concentration for each
drug. Cells (5  106) were then centrifuged and washed with ice-cold PBS,
followed by resuspension in 135 AL PBS with 15 AL of 100 Amol/L AraCTP
or dFdCTP as internal standards. Subsequently, 50 AL of 40% TCA was
added, followed by vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was
neutralized with 400 AL of trioctylamine/trichlorotrifluoroethane (1:4).
After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was subjected to HPLC using a
ZirChrom SAX HPLC column with photo-diode array detection and
a gradient from 100% 10 mmol/L K2HPO4 and 40 mmol/L NaCl (pH 6.8),
to 65% 100 mmol/L K2HPO4 and 400 mmol/L K2HPO4 (pH 6.8).
Caspase-3/7 activity assay. Caspase-3/7 activity was determined as a
measure of apoptosis using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit (Promega
BioSciences). siRNA-transfected cells were then treated for 72 h with
increasing concentrations of gemcitabine or AraC. One hundred microliters
of Caspase-Glo 3/7 Reagent was added, and the cells were incubated at
room temperature for 1 h, followed by the measurement of luminescence.
Statistical methods. Three different logistic functions were used to fit
the cytotoxicity data. The logistic model with the lowest mean square error
was used to determine IC50 values. Expression array data were normalized

on a log 2 scale, using both GCRMA and Fastlo (19, 20). Normalized
expression data were regressed on gender, race, and time since the Coriell
Institute acquired the cell line. Residuals were then standardized by
subtracting the mean residual for individual probe sets and dividing by the
SD to derive a ‘‘standardized adjusted expression value.’’ Analyses were
based on adjusted standardized values for both expression array and logtransformed IC50 data. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated, and
a Wald test was used to test for a nonzero correlation. Multiple testing using
10,000 permutations was performed for selected probe sets. The
contribution of pathway genes to expression was based on the coefficient
of determination (R2) using a multiple regression model. Differences in
intracellular metabolites between randomly selected resistant and sensitive
cell lines were determined with Student’s t test. Correlations between
expression array and QRT-PCR or intracellular metabolites were also
determined. Agreement between cytotoxicity performed at different times
was determined using an intraclass correlation coefficient. Ingenuity
pathway analysis was performed by using Fischer’s exact test to calculate
P values to identify genes within given pathways.

Results
Gemcitabine and AraC cytotoxicity. Gemcitabine and AraC
cytotoxicity studies were performed to determine the range of
variation in IC50 values as an indication of individual cell line
variation in drug sensitivity. Average unadjusted IC50 values
for gemcitabine and AraC in these 197 cell lines were 25.3 F
30.7 nmol/L and 8.4 F 14.3 Amol/L (mean F SD), respectively.
IC50 differed among the groups of subjects studied (P < 0.01 for
both drugs), with CEPH samples appearing to be more resistant to
both drugs when compared with the three other groups. Gender
did not seem to have a significant effect on IC50 values for either
gemcitabine (P = 0.39) or AraC (P = 0.88). The time since the Coriell
Institute acquired the cell lines had a slight effect on gemcitabine
(P = 0.037) but not AraC IC50 values (P = 0.18). We also performed a

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

replication study to exclude the possibility that this phenotype
might vary over time. Specifically, 12 ethnically diverse cell lines
were selected randomly and cytotoxicity assays were repeated 3
months after the initial experiments. There was good agreement
between results at the two different times. The intraclass
correlation coefficient was 0.83 [95% confidence interval (95%
CI), 0.51–0.95] for gemcitabine and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.26–0.91) for
AraC.
Association between expression and cytotoxicity. Correlations between basal gene expression and IC50 values for gemcitabine
and AraC were determined to identify genes that might contribute
to variation in cytotoxicity. The 26,653 RefSeq validated sequences
among the 54,000 Affymetrix probe sets were used to perform these
correlation studies. The P values for association for gemcitabine
tended to be smaller than those for AraC (Fig. 1A). With the
exception of NT5C3, genes encoding proteins in the ‘‘cytidine
analogue pathway’’ (Supplementary Table S1), shown as red points
in Fig. 1, did not display highly significant P values. NT5C3 had only
one probe set, and it was significantly associated with gemcitabine
IC50 values (P = 1.6  10 7; Fig. 1A). NT5C3 encodes a member of
the nucleotidase family that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of
monophosphorylated drug metabolites, thus decreasing the concentration of active drug metabolites. NT5C3 expression showed a
less significant association with AraC IC50 values, although among
all genes within the ‘‘pathway’’ (Supplementary Table S1), it also had
the smallest P value for AraC (P = 0.004). Because most previous
studies have focused only on pathway genes, we also estimated the
effect of variation in expression for all known pathway genes on
variation in IC50 values. Approximately 27% of the variation in
gemcitabine IC50 values and f11% of the variation for AraC could
be explained by variation in gene expression within this intensively
studied metabolic pathway.

Cytidine Cytotoxicity and Genome-Wide Expression

Among the 26,653 probe sets tested, 55 had P values of V10 6 for
gemcitabine (adjusted multiple testing P value = 0.0002) and 21 had
P values of V10 5 (adjusted multiple testing P value = 0.047).
Because gemcitabine and AraC function in a similar fashion as
antineoplastic drugs, we overlapped significant genes for both
drugs. To identify top candidate genes for each drug that might be
further characterized functionally, we used P values as a way to
rank genes with regard to their association with drug cytotoxicity
rather than establishing a particular ‘‘cutoff ’’ value because very
few of the candidate genes could pass Bonferroni correction.
Therefore, we arbitrarily used a P value cutoff of <10 3 for AraC
and <10 4 for gemcitabine to obtain a similar number of genes for
each drug, realizing that we might still miss some true candidate
genes. Thirty-one probe sets were identified that were common
to both gemcitabine and AraC. Among those 31 probe sets, 14
encoding 12 genes were replicated when we used a different
method of expression array normalization, Fastlo (Table 1). In
addition, three ‘‘nonoverlapping’’ genes with highly significant

associations for either gemcitabine or AraC are also listed in
Table 1.
To verify expression array data for these 15 genes (18 probe sets),
20 lymphoblastoid cell lines were randomly selected to perform
real-time QRT-PCR, and the results were compared with the
expression array data. However, before performing QRT-PCR, we
determined the specificity of these 18 probe sets by aligning the
sequences of individual probes with the sequences of their
presumed gene targets. We only verified probe specificity for top
candidate genes that were considered for further functional
validation because it was practically difficult to verify specificity
for all 26,653 probe sets. Seven probe sets (Table 1) lacked specificity, defined as at least 5 of 11 probes that were ‘‘nonspecific.’’
When we performed real-time QRT-PCR and correlated RT-PCR
with expression array for these nonspecific probe sets, they did not
correlate significantly (Table 1). Among the remaining 11 probe
sets for 9 genes, 9 showed significant or near significant correlations between QRT-PCR and expression array data (P < 0.05),

whereas two (MYBBP1A and ZNF278) failed to show a significant
correlation (Table 1).
NT5C3 and FKBP5 candidate gene validation. To confirm
results obtained during the association study, we selected two
candidate genes for functional validation with specific siRNA,
followed by cytotoxicity studies. These genes were selected on the
basis of the significance of the observed association and whether
the gene was within or outside of the cytidine analogue metabolism
pathway. The first was a pathway gene, NT5C3, a gene encoding
an enzyme that dephosphorylates active cytidine analogue metabolites to form the inactive parent drug. Although NT5C3 is a
pathway gene, no previous reports had suggested that NT5C3
might play a role in sensitivity to cytidine analogues, although
other members of the nucleotidase family, e.g., NT5C and NT5C1A,
have been associated with clinical response (21, 22). Our association study had shown a positive correlation between the NT5C3
expression levels and gemcitabine IC50 values (P = 1.6  10 7;
Bonferroni-corrected P value = 0.0004; r = 0.365), indicating—as
anticipated—that high expression of NT5C3 was associated with
gemcitabine resistance.
The second gene tested was from outside of the metabolic
pathway, FKBP5, a gene encoding a 51 kDa immunophilin. FKBP5
is involved in steroid receptor maturation, and it is a binding
partner for rapamycin (23–25). However, there had been no
previous indication that FKBP5 might be involved in response to
cytidine analogues. In contrast to NT5C3, expression levels for
FKBP5 were negatively correlated with gemcitabine IC50 values
(r = 0.38), indicating that increased FKBP5 transcription
resulted in increased sensitivity to these drugs. Three Affymetrix
probe sets targeted FKBP5, although we found that one probe
set was not specific (Table 1). Both specific probe sets showed

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

highly significant associations with gemcitabine IC50 values
(P = 4.12  10 8 and 4.15  10 8, respectively). After Bonferroni
correction, the P values for these two FKBP5 probe sets remained
significant (P = 0.0001). However, neither NT5C3 nor FKBP5 were
significantly associated with AraC cytotoxicity (P = 3.47  10 3 for
NT5C3 and P = 1.26  10 2 for FKBP5); although, as described
subsequently, both proved to influence AraC response when tested
functionally.
To confirm the possible functional significance of these two
genes, we performed siRNA knockdown studies, followed by
cytotoxicity assays, using two tumor cell lines to confirm the
results of the association study and to extend our results beyond
the lymphoblastoid cell lines to include cancer cell lines. Although
neither gene displayed as significant an association with AraC as
with gemcitabine cytotoxicity, functional studies were performed
with both drugs. Although AraC is mainly used clinically to treat
AML, previous studies have also used solid tumor cell lines for the
analysis of both gemcitabine and AraC cytotoxicity (26). Two
human cancer cell lines, the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line
and the pancreatic cancer SU86 cell line, were used to perform
functional studies because gemcitabine is used to treat both types
of cancers and because NT5C3 and FKBP5 showed their most
significant associations with IC50 values for gemcitabine.
We first performed transient transfections with NT5C3 and
FKBP5-specific siRNAs. Western blots verified that both genes
were knocked down in both tumor cell lines (Figs. 2A and 3A).
Gemcitabine and AraC cytotoxicity studies were then performed
after transient transfection with siRNA. Down-regulation of NT5C3
with specific siRNA shifted the dose response curve to the left
compared with control siRNA transfection, indicating increased
sensitivity to gemcitabine in both cell lines (Fig. 2B), consistent

with results obtained during the genome-wide expression association study. In contrast, FKBP5 had shown a negative correlation
between level of expression and IC50 values. That relationship was
confirmed by knockdown experiments performed with FKBP5specific siRNA because down-regulation of FKBP5 in the both
tumor cell lines desensitized the cells to both gemcitabine and
AraC compared with nonspecific siRNA transfection (Fig. 3B). We
also performed siRNA studies with two genes that were not
significantly associated with IC50 values for either drug as ‘‘negative
controls.’’ One of those genes was FKBP1A, encoding FKBP12, a
family member related to FKBP5, and the other was NT5C2, a gene
encoding a family member of nucleotidases. Knockdown performed with specific siRNA for FKBP1A and NT5C2 did not
significantly alter response to either gemcitabine or AraC
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Characterization of NT5C3 and FKBP5 cytotoxicity mechanisms. The 5¶-nucleotidases catalyze the dephosphorylation of
nucleoside monophosphates and, as a result, inactivate active
phosphorylated drug metabolites (22). Both clinical and in vitro
studies suggest that an increase in nucleotidase activity can reverse
nucleoside analogue metabolic activation, resulting in drug
resistance (22, 27). Furthermore, NT5C3 hydrolyzes pyrimidine
monophosphates such as the active metabolites of gemcitabine

and AraC (22, 28). As a result, the effect of NT5C3 on gemcitabine
and AraC cytotoxicity could result from alterations in levels of
active intracellular drug metabolites. Therefore, we randomly
selected seven sensitive and seven resistant lymphoblastoid cell
lines for gemcitabine and another seven sensitive and seven
resistant lymphoblastoid cell lines for AraC to measure levels of
active intracellular diphosphate and the triphosphate metabolites
for both drugs. Sensitive and resistant cell lines were defined as cell
lines with IC50 values of >0.85 SD from the mean of the IC50
distribution curve. Using this definition, we identified 32 resistant
and 31 sensitive cell lines for gemcitabine and 35 resistant and 38
sensitive cell lines for AraC. The sensitive and resistant cell lines
used to measure intracellular metabolites were selected randomly
from these two groups. HPLC was used to measure levels of
intracellular phosphorylated metabolites in these cells after 3 days
of treatment with gemcitabine or AraC. Concentrations of active
metabolites were higher in sensitive than in resistant cell lines
(P < 0.05; Table 2). These results imply that genes within the
cytidine analogue metabolic pathway, including the 5¶-NTs, may
contribute to the variation in cytotoxicity that we had observed.
Equally important was the fact that intracellular metabolite
concentrations were inversely related to levels of NT5C3 mRNA
(Fig. 2C). This result was consistent with the conclusion that higher

Figure 4. Caspase activity in SU86 and MDA-MB-231 cells after FKBP5 siRNA treatment. Caspase activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 activity
assay in A and C for MDA-MB-231 cells and in B and D for SU86 cells treated with FKBP5 siRNA in the presence of gemcitabine (A and B) or AraC (C and D). Points,
mean for three independent experiments; bars, SE.

NT5C3 expression in these cells was associated with AraC and
gemcitabine dephosphorylation, with decreased concentrations of
active drug metabolites, resulting in drug resistance. These findings
were also consistent with results of our NT5C3-siRNA functional
studies (Fig. 2B).
We next attempted to test hypotheses with regard to mechanisms by which FKBP5 might influence sensitivity to gemcitabine
and AraC. One possibility would involve the blockade of apoptosis
signaling pathways as a result of FKBP5 knockdown. We also performed caspase-3/7 activity assays to determine whether alterations in FKBP5 expression might influence apoptotic signaling
because previous studies had suggested that FKBP5 might be
involved in apoptosis (29). Caspase-3/7 activity in FKBP5 siRNA–
treated cells was significantly decreased after treatment with
increasing concentrations of both gemcitabine and AraC when
compared with cells treated with negative siRNA (Fig. 4), suggesting that activation of the apoptotic pathway was affected by
the down-regulation of FKBP5 expression.
Gene network analysis. In an attempt to help define biological
relationships among candidate genes identified during our study,
we also applied Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (30). That analysis was
focused on top ranked genes based on P values, using P values of
<10 5 for gemcitabine and <10 4 for AraC that were significant
with both GCRMA and Fastlo normalization methods. Eighty-four
probe sets for gemcitabine and 75 for AraC were used to perform
this analysis. A total of 9 and 20 networks were identified for
gemcitabine and AraC, respectively. The ‘‘top’’ networks, with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

P values of <0.05 based on Fisher’s exact text were associated with
cell death, cancer, cell growth and proliferation, cell signaling, DNA
replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, and nucleic acid
metabolism (Supplementary Table S2). On the basis of pathways
with the highest number of significant candidate genes, cancer was
identified as the major disease, and cell signaling and the cell cycle
were the major molecular and cellular functions identified. These
preliminary results are clearly consistent with the use of these
drugs to treat cancer.

Discussion
Drug response predictors have evolved significantly in the
postgenomic era. Rather than using single genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites to predict response, information from across
the genome is now available to help predict drug response (4).
Variation in response to chemotherapy results from a combination
of factors that include gene sequence variation, ultimately resulting
in differences in mRNA and protein expression, but also including
differences in gender, ethnic group, or environmental factors.
Variation in mRNA is one important factor that may contribute to
variation in response to chemotherapy (31). To screen for possible
pharmacogenomic candidate genes that might contribute to
variation in drug response, we tested the relationship between
variation in basal gene expression and sensitivity to gemcitabine
and AraC using Human Variation Panel cell lines, a model system
designed to study common human genetic variation.

Cytidine Cytotoxicity and Genome-Wide Expression

Gemcitabine and AraC share similar chemical structures and
pathways of metabolism, but they are used in very different ways
clinically (8, 32). Gemcitabine is mainly used to treat solid tumors,
whereas AraC is first line chemotherapy for AML (7, 12, 13, 33, 34).
Clinical response to these two cytidine analogues varies widely
(8, 14, 15, 35). We set out to use the Human Variation Panel model
system to identify candidate genes that might contribute to this
variation. It should be emphasized once again that, although the
tumor genome is critical for understanding disease pathophysiology and response to therapy, the germline genome is also critical,
especially for response to drug therapy. In addition, variation in
gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells is strongly influenced by
inheritance (36). Therefore, these cell lines represent one model
system suitable for the study of the contribution of ‘‘pharmacogenomic’’ variation in expression to individual variation in drug
response.
Previous studies have shown that variation in the expression of
genes within the cytidine analogue metabolism and bioactivation
pathway is associated with variation in response to gemcitabine
and AraC (37–39). However, little information is available with
regard to genes outside of this pathway. Therefore, rather than
focus only on the known pathway, we used 26,635 expression probe
sets to perform association analysis with drug response, in this
case, cytotoxicity. However, this type of approach will also produce
false-positive results if functional validation experiments, such as
those that we applied, are not performed. Therefore, we first
identified candidate genes, both within and outside of the known
pathway, which might be important for response to these two
cytidine analogues, followed by functional validation.
As a first step, our strategy involved obtaining expression data
for 197 cell lines, followed by gemcitabine and AraC cytotoxicity
assays. By correlating expression and IC50 values for both drugs, we
identified genes both within and outside of the currently known
cytidine analogue metabolic pathway that were significantly
associated with cytotoxicity (Table 1). One pathway gene, NT5C3,
a gene not previously identified as a factor in response to
gemcitabine or AraC, showed a significant association with
cytotoxicity. However, the overall contribution of expression for
all pathway genes to variation in IC50 values was only f27% for
gemcitabine and 11% for AraC. These observations emphasize the
potential advantage of genome-wide analyses rather than focusing
entirely on known biological pathways. Although none of the genes
listed in the Table 1 have been previously reported to be associated
with gemcitabine or AraC response, our results complement and
extend several previous reports of correlations of response to
gemcitabine with gene expression profiles in cancer cell lines or
tumor tissue samples obtained from patients (3, 40–43).
The lymphoblastoid cell lines used in our study are EBV
transformed, so they are neither tumor cell lines nor tumor tissue.
Therefore, one potential problem with the use of these cell lines is
that EBV transformation could influence drug sensitivity and/or
expression profiles, so we might miss some genes of importance,
either because they are not expressed in these cell lines or, after

transformation, are down-regulated. There is also evidence
showing that gemcitabine and doxorubicin can induce the lytic
form of EBV-transformed cells (44). However, the fact that we were
able to functionally validate the two candidate genes that we
studied supports the feasibility of our approach. Furthermore,
lymphoblastoid cells have been used to identify genetic variation
associated with cytotoxicity for other antineoplastic drugs,
including daunorubicin, another drug that also potentially induces
EBV lytic forms (45, 46). Finally, in any high-throughput association
study, candidate genes identified require functional validation, as
performed for our two candidate genes.
NT5C3 encodes a protein involved in cytidine metabolism,
whereas FKBP5 lies outside of that pathway. Their novelty, and the
fact that one of these genes is within, whereas the other is outside
of our current sphere of knowledge, highlights the potential of this
model system for hypothesis generation. Although several 5¶-NT
isoforms have been reported to be associated with AraC and
gemcitabine response (22, 47, 48), the role of the ‘‘pyrimidinespecific’’ nucleotidase NT5C3 in response to these drugs is unexplored (28, 49). FKBP5 is a 51-kDa immunophilin (23, 50) that,
just as NT5C3, has never previously been reported to influence
gemcitabine cytotoxicity. Our studies indicated that decreased
expression of NT5C3 and FKBP5 after specific siRNA treatment
altered response to both gemcitabine and AraC but through
different mechanisms. The functional characterization of both
NT5C3 and FKBP5 provided biological evidence in support of their
involvement in variation in gemcitabine and AraC cytotoxicity.
Finally, although P values for AraC were not as significant as
those for gemcitabine, functional studies of NT5C3 and FKBP5
showed similar effects for both drugs. That observation reminds us
of the limitations of P values when determining true associations,
as well as the fact that genome-wide association studies represent
only one step in the identification of biomarkers to help predict
clinically relevant variation in response to chemotherapy or new
targets that might be used to enhance treatment outcomes. These
results can now be applied in translational studies designed to test
the hypothesis that variation in the expression of these two genes
might be associated with clinically relevant variation in response to
therapy with gemcitabine and/or AraC.
