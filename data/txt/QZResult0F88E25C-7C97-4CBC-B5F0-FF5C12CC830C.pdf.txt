Abstract
The identification of a signalling protein that regulates the accumulation of fat and connective
tissue in breasts may help to explain why high mammographic density is linked to breast-cancer
risk and may provide a marker for predicting this risk.

Our ability to evaluate the lifetime risk of breast cancer in women who have a family history
of breast and ovarian cancer was revolutionized by the identification1 of the breast-cancerassociated genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. But although this was a landmark discovery, it has
not translated into improvements in the assessment of breast-cancer risk in the general
population2, because more than 95% of women who develop breast cancer do not have a
BRCA-gene mutation3. So the search for biomarkers to predict the risk in these women
remains a goal for many biologists, clinicians and epidemiologists.
Over the past decade, increased mammographic density — thought to result primarily from
an increased proportion of breast collagen content relative to fat-tissue content4,5 — has
emerged as a non-genetic marker of breast-cancer risk6. However, the biological mechanism
that relates tissue density to tumour development is poorly defined. Writing in Cancer
Discovery, DeFilippis et al.7 now provide a link between mammographic density and
cellular signalling during the initiation of breast cancer.

The human breast is composed of many cell types, including connective-tissue (stromal)
cells, fat cells (adipocytes), cells that make up blood vessels (endothelial cells) and immune
cells. Collectively, these cells make up the microenvironment of the breast8. Over the past
five years, it has been increasingly recognized that this microenvironment, including the
relative proportions of different types of cell and therefore the tissue density, may have a
major role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer9,10. One indication of this role is
the epidemiological link between mammographic density and cancer risk: Caucasian women
with high mammographic density have a two- to sixfold increase in life-time risk of
developing breast cancer6. Another indication is the physical change in the breast micro
environment that is seen in the initial stages of breast-tumour formation. This is described as
a ‘desmoplastic’ reaction, which is characterized by the recruitment and activation of
stromal cells and results in increased collagen deposition in the breast — and therefore
increased mammographic density11.
The increased density is measured by a general increase in X-ray absorbance and is
therefore relatively inexpensive and easy to measure. But we have little understanding of
what determines increased density and how this is linked to increased cancer risk and the
initiation of tumour formation4,6. The situation is complicated by the complex relationships
between mammographic density, breast-cancer risk, ageing, obesity and race. For example,
mammographic density typically declines with age12, but, because breast cancer is an agerelated disease, this means, paradoxically, that a woman’s breast-cancer risk will increase
with age while her mammographic density declines.

DeFilippis and colleagues have helped to unravel this story by revealing that expression of a
single molecule, CD36, is necessary and sufficient to regulate two key features of
mammographic density: the number of adipocytes in the breast and the amount of collagen
deposited in the breast tissue. The authors show that expression of CD36 is lower in breasttissue cells of women with high mammographic density — in women with or without breast
cancer — than in cells from breasts with normal density. CD36 is an integral membrane
protein found in many cell types, and it is already known to regulate several basic cellular
processes governing how cells interact and grow, including the differentiation of adipocytes,
the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and immune signalling13. Now it seems that
an influence on mammographic density can be added to this list.
To establish how CD36 expression exerts its effects on breast-tissue density, the authors
modulated CD36 expression in vitro in cells taken from healthy human breast tissue. They
found that reducing CD36 expression led to a decrease in the total number of fat cells and an
increase in the amount of collagen deposited in the extracellular matrix around the cells;
higher CD36 expression increased the number of fat cells. The researchers also observed
lower fat accumulation and greater collagen accumulation in the mammary glands of mice
lacking the Cd36 gene. These findings indicate that inhibition of this protein is sufficient to
recapitulate some of the key events that lead to higher mammographic density and initiation
of breast cancer.

Not only do these findings provide a mechanistic link between cell-signalling pathways and
mammographic density, they are also a convincing indication that loss of CD36 may be an
early event in breast carcinogenesis. Although mammographic density is used as a surrogate
marker of breast-cancer risk in the general population, it is an imprecise indicator. It gives
little insight into the biology of why a woman might develop breast cancer, and it is
confounded by paradoxes, such as the increase in density but decrease in risk if a woman
exercises, or the decrease in density but increase in risk as a woman ages. By demonstrating
that CD36 links the biology of breast density with the biology of breast-cancer initiation,
DeFillipis and colleagues have identified information that may help to make density a more
useful marker of risk. Finally, their results also raise the possibility that CD36 could be
pharmacologically targeted in attempts to prevent breast cancer in the majority of women
who (fortunately) lack a BRCA mutation.

Figure 1. Regulating the breast microenvironment

The main tissue types in human breasts are adipose (fat) tissue and stromal (connective)
tissue, which contains collagen. The ratio of fat to collagen determines the mammographic
density of the breast, with density increasing as the relative amount of fat tissue falls. High
mammographic density is a known risk factor for breast cancer, and mammographic density
also increases as a breast tumour forms. DeFilippis et al.7 have found that expression of the
cell-signalling protein CD36 is lower in several types of cell taken from breasts that have
high mammographic density, both in the presence or absence of cancer. They also show that
reduced CD36 expression leads to increased collagen deposition and decreased fat
accumulation in the breast.
