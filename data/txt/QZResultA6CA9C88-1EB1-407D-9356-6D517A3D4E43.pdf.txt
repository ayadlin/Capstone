ABSTRACT
Osimertinib (OSI, also known as AZD9291) is the newest FDA-approved
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor for non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR T790M mutation. However, resistance to OSI
is likely to progress and the study of potential OSI-resistant mechanisms in advanced
is necessary. Here, the OSI-resistant NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were established. After
cells developed resistance to OSI, cell proliferation was decreased while cell migration
and invasion were increased. The NCI-H1975/OSIR cells exhibited more resistance
to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, rociletinib, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil, meanwhile
showing higher sensitivity to paclitaxel, when compared with NCI-H1975 cells. In
addition, the NCI-H1975/OSIR cells did not display multidrug resistance phenotype.
The activation and expression of EGFR were decreased after cells exhibited resistance.
Compared with NCI-H1975 cells, the activation of ERK and AKT in NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells could not be significantly inhibited by OSI treatment. Navitoclax (ABT-263)induced cell viability inhibition and apoptosis were more significant in NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells than that in NCI-H1975 cells. Moreover, these effects of navitoclax in
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells could be reversed by pretreatment of Z-VAD-FMK. Collectively,
loss of EGFR could pose as one of the OSI-resistant mechanisms and navitoclax might
be the candidate drug for OSI-resistant NSCLC patients.

as well as good initial responses to the established EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib, erlotinib,
and afatinib etc. [6, 7]. Unfortunately, most patients will
eventually experience resistance to these EGFR TKIs, with
disease progression approximately 12 months after treatment
[7, 8]. Multiple molecular mechanisms of resistance to EGFR
TKIs have been identified in clinical NSCLC patients, such
as second mutation of EGFR, amplification of MET, small
cell histologic transformation, and epithelial mesenchymal
transition [9-11]. Among these resistant mechanisms, second
mutation of EGFR (T790M mutation, the gate keeper
position of the kinase domain of EGFR) is best characterized
and most commonly occurring, observed in 60% of EGFRmutant NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib
and erlotinib [9]. In order to specifically target T790M
mutation and sensitive mutation of EGFR, numerous of third
generations of EGFR TKIs are being developed, such as

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts
for about 85% of lung cancer, is one of the most common
cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related death in
the world [1 ,2]. The current survival rate of NSCLC still
remains low despite significant improvements in molecular
diagnosis and therapy strategies [1, 3]. The epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK),
and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) etc., are current molecular
biomarkers that directly impact clinical therapy strategies
for NSCLC [3]. Among these biomarkers, EGFR is one of
the most extensively studied molecular subsets and about
10-40% of NSCLC patients harbor activating mutations of
EGFR (mainly includes a deletion in exon 19 and/or a point
mutation in exon 21) [4, 5]. Patients with these mutations
frequently experience enhanced kinase activity of EGFR

osimertinib (OSI), rociletinib (also known as CO-1686), and
WZ4002 [12, 13].
OSI is an oral and irreversible EGFR TKI with high
selectivity against patients harboring EGFR sensitive
mutation and T790M resistant mutation [12]. Compared
with previous EGFR TKIs, OSI exhibited remarkably
higher activity against EGFR with T790M versus
against wild-type EGFR [12]. Clinical studies indicated
that OSI (20 to 240 mg/day) was highly effective in
NSCLC patients harboring EGFR T790M mutation who
experienced disease progression during prior therapies
with gefitinib or erlotinib. The median progression-free
survival of patients with EGFR T790M-positive mutation
was 9.6 months, meanwhile only 2.8 months in EGFR
T790M-negative patients, and no dose-limiting toxicities
were observed [13]. Due to the effectiveness of OSI in
EGFR T790M mutation NSCLC patients, OSI is currently
the only FDA-approved third generation of EGFR TKI for
NSCLC patients with EGFR T790M positive mutation.
So far, various clinical trials of OSI are being conducted,
such as the therapeutic effects of OSI versus gefitinib or
erlotinib in EGFR-TKI sensitive mutation of naive NSCLC
patients [14] and the comparison of OSI with doublet
chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) as second-line
therapy strategy for patients with advanced EGFR T790M
NSCLC patients [15]. However, past history with FDAapproved EGFR TKIs suggests that there is likelihood for
resistance to OSI to develop which can potentially restrict
its therapy effects. Therefore, identifying possible resistant
mechanisms of OSI in advance is important to provide a
basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for
OSI-resistant patients.
In the present study, OSI-resistant cells (NCI-H1975/
OSIR) were developed and the biological properties and
potential resistant mechanisms were characterized to shed
light on possible therapeutic strategy against OSI-resistance.

with OSI were detected. Treatment of NCI-H1975 cells
with 0.03 μM and 0.5 μM OSI decreased the cell colony
formation. However, the colony formation of NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells was not decreased after treatment with OSI, even
at the concentration of 0.5 μM OSI (Figure 1D).

Characterization of the proliferation, migration,
and invasion abilities of NCI-H1975 and
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells
After long-term exposure to OSI, great changes in
cell morphology, proliferation, migration, and invasion
were observed in NCI-H1975 cells. As shown in Figure
2A, NCI-H1975/OSIR cells have a bigger cell size and
more fibroblast-like cell shape, compared with NCI-H1975
cells. The cell proliferation ability of NCI-H1975 and
NCI-H975/OSIR cells from day 1 to day 7 without any
treatment was studied by MTT assay. NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells grew more slowly than NCI-H1975 cells,
with proliferation rates of 149.41%, 249.36%, 308.20%,
369.06%, 466.46%, and 634.87% from Day1 to Day 7
respectively for NCI-H1975 cells and 143.36%, 193.02%,
238.44%, 267.99%, 353.82%, and 456.70% from Day 1
to Day 7 respectively for NCI-H1975/OSIR cells (Figure
2B). The protein expression of PCNA, which is essential
for cell replication [16], decreased after NCI-H1975 cells
obtained resistance to OSI (Figure 2C). In addition, the
cell migration (without matrigel) and invasion (with
matrigel) abilities of each cell line, which are crucial for
cell metastasis [17], were evaluated using transwell assays.
As shown in Figure 2D and E, more NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells than NCI-H1975 cells passed through the upper
membrane of the transwell inserts, regardless of whether
the inserts were pretreated with matrigel. Considering
the activations of FAK, Src, and Paxillin are critical for
cell metastasis [18], western blot analysis was preformed
and results indicated that the activations of FAK, Src, and
Paxillin were higher in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells, compared
with NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 2F). Furthermore, increased
expression of MMP2 and decreased expression of TIMP2
proteins have been strongly associated with cell metastasis
[19]. As shown in Figure 2F, MMP2 expression was higher
while the TIMP2 expression was lower in NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells, compared with NCI-H1975 cells. The
aforementioned results demonstrated that NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells exhibited slower cell proliferation rate
while higher cell migration and invasion abilities when
compared with NCI-H1975 cells.

RESULTS
Establishment of NCI-H1975 cells resistant to
OSI
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were established from
NCI-H1975 cells through dosage-escalation of OSI from
0.03 μM to 1.5 μM for about 6 months (Figure 1A). The
cell viabilities of NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells following OSI treatment were studied by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-Diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The cell viability of NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells did not decrease as significantly as that of
NCI-H1975 cells after exposure to OSI for 72h (Figure 1B).
The IC50 values of OSI for NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells were 0.03 μM and 4.77 μM, respectively (Figure
1C). To further confirm the resistant property of NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells to OSI, the colony formation abilities of

resistance remains unclear [20]. In the present study, the
FDA-approved EGFR TKIs (the first generation EGFR
TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib and the second generation
EGFR TKI afatinib) were employed to study the antiproliferation in NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR cells.
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were more tolerant to EGFR
TKIs than NCI-H1975 cells, with resistance indexes
of 1.784, 5.143, and 13.239 for gefitinib, erlotinib, and
afatinib, respectively (Figure 3A and 3B). Furthermore,
the third generation EGFR TKI rociletinib, which is
currently under clinical trial [21], was also studied. The
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of rociletinib

in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells (7.707 μΜ) was higher than
that in NCI-H1975 cells (0.092 μΜ) (Figure 3A and
3B). The chemotherapeutics are also drug options for
treatment of the EGFR TKIs-resistant patients [22]. The
anti-proliferation of chemotherapeutics in NCI-H1975
and NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were detected. As shown
in Figure 4A and 4B, NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were
more sensitive to paclitaxel than NCI-H1975 cells.
Although cells resistance to OSI showed less resistant
to pemetrexed, the anti-proliferation of pemetrexed in
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells was still weak (Figure 4A and
4B). Compared with NCI-H1975 cells, NCI-H1975/OSIR

cells were more resistant to doxorubicin (IC50, 0.114 μΜ
in NCI-H1975 cells and 0.461 μΜ in NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells) and fluorouracil (IC50, 43.910 μΜ in NCI-H1975
cells and more than 100 μΜ in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells)
(Figure 4A and 4B). In addition, the mRNA expressions
of multiple drug resistance (MDR) genes, such as MRP1,
MRP7, ABCG2, LRP, ABCE1, and ABCF1, were detected
by RT-PCR assay. Result indicated that the mRNA levels
of MDR genes in NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR cells

were similar (Figure 4C). Moreover, the protein expression
of P-gp in both cell lines was unexpressed (Figure 4D).

mechanisms of the third generation EGFR TKI OSI
are rare and unclear [12, 23]. Here, NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells exhibited lower phosphorylated and total
expressions of EGFR than that in NCI-H1975 cells
(Figure 5A). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of
EGFR in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells was only 0.49 fold of
that in NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 5B). ERK and AKT are
two major downstream proteins of the EGFR pathway
and inhibition of the EGFR pathway can decrease the
phosphorylation of ERK and AKT [24]. In this study,
OSI significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK
and AKT in NCI-H1975 cells while not in NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells (Figure 5C and 5D). It can be concluded that
the down-regulation of EGFR expression might contribute
to the resistance of OSI in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells.

NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR cells following
navitoclax treatment were studied. As shown in Figure 6A,
cells were treated with various concentrations of navitoclax
for 48 h. The cell viability for the NCI-H1975/OSIR cells
were significantly lower than that for the NCI-H1975 cell
line, with cell viabilities remaining at 70.48%, 62.57%,
and 49.35% for NCI-H1975 cells and 49.35%, 31.94%,
and 18.27% for NCI-H1975/OSIR cells after treatment
with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM navitoclax, respectively. This
difference in cell viability inhibition of navitoclax in
NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were further
confirmed by colony formation analysis. Fewer colonies
were observed in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells after treatment
with navitoclax, when compared with NCI-H1975
cells (Figure 6B). In order to investigate the potential
mechanisms for the aforementioned phenomenon, the
pro-apoptotic effect of navitoclax in the two cell lines
was studied. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI)
dual labeling assay demonstrated that a higher percentage
of apoptotic cell was induced by navitoclax treatment in
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells than in NCI-H1975 cells (Figure
6C). In addition, the protein expressions of c-PARP and

c-caspase 3, which are biomarkers of apoptosis, were
studied via western blot. As shown in Figure 6D, the
navitoclax-induced expressions of c-PARP and c-caspase 3
proteins were more remarkable in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells,
compared with NCI-H1975 cells. These data indicated that
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were more sensitive to navitoclax,
compared with NCI-H1975 cells.

with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-ValAla-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK). As
shown in Figure 7A, the cell viability in navitoclax alonetreated group remained at 37.75% while the cell viability
in navitoclax and Z-VAD-FMK combination-treated group
was 62.50%. Annexin-FITC and PI staining indicated that

to these EGFR TKIs after approximately 12 months of
treatment. So far, OSI is the only US FDA-approved third
generation EGFR TKI for NSCLC patients with EGFR
T790M mutation experiencing disease progression after
treatment with EGFR TKIs. As resistance to OSI is likely
to occur, the advance identification of possible resistant
mechanisms of OSI and developing effective strategies
for OSI-resistant patients are necessary. In this study, we
established an OSI-resistant cell line, NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells, by dosage-escalation. The biological properties
of NCI-H1975/OSIR cells in terms of proliferation,
migration, invasion, and sensitivity to other EGFR TKIs

expression might be a resistant mechanism for OSI in

NCI-H1975/OSIR cells and navitoclax could be a potential
candidate drug for OSI-resistant NSCLC patients.
Cancer cells activate the growth-promoting signals
to maintain sustained cell proliferation [25]. Here, the
proliferation of NCI-H1975/OSIR cells was slower than
that of the parent cells, indicating that certain proliferative
signals, for example the EGFR pathway, in NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells might be damaged. In addition, increased
abilities of migration and invasion of the resistant cells
indicated that they might possess a higher metastatic
ability, which is one of the characteristics of cancer
malignancy [25]. Therefore, cells might gain malignancy
during acquisition of resistance to OSI. The migration and
invasion abilities of NSCLC cells were also increased
after cells acquired resistance to EGFR TKI gefitinib [26].
Therefore, increased metastatic potential of cancer cells
should be considered during treatment with EGFR TKIs
in NSCLC patents.
ALK expressed in about 4-6% in NSCLC patients,
is also an important molecular biomarker for NSCLC
patients [27, 28]. Recently, an in vivo study indicated
that first generation of ALK inhibitor crizotinib could
significantly overcome the resistance to second generation
of ALK inhibitor alectinib [29]. Thus, the sensitivity of
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells to first, second, and other third
generation EGFR TKIs were evaluated. Unfortunately,
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells showed resistance to all these
EGFR TKIs, indicating that gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib as
well as rociletinib might not be effective for OSI-resistant
patients. Comparing the treatment effects of OSI versus
gefitinib or erlotinib in EGFR-TKI sensitive mutation of
naive NSCLC patients was currently in clinical studying
[14]. The overall survival of patients with EGFR sensitive
mutation who were first treated with gefitinib or erlotinib,
then with OSI after resistance occurred, was about 21
moths [7, 13]. However, whether OSI could be utilized
as first-line treatment for NSCLC patients with EGFRsensitive mutation is worth considering, as no other drugs
are currently approved by FDA for OSI-resistant patients.
The chemotherapeutics were also therapy options for
EGFR TKIs resistant patients [22]. Here, NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells were more sensitive to anti-microtubule drug
paclitaxel than NCI-H1975 cells, and clinical study also
indicated that the OSI-resistant patients showed more
sensitive to paclitaxel [30]. Although NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells were less resistant anti-metabolite drug pemetrexed,
the relatively high concentration of pemetrexed showed
weak anti-proliferation in NCI-H1975/OSIR cells.
Compared with NCI-H1975 cells, the NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells presented more resistance to doxorubicin and
fluorouracil, and this resistant effect was not due to the
MDR phenotype. Collectively, the paclitaxel could be a
therapeutic option for OSI-resistant patients, while the
potential mechanism needed to be determined.
Patients resistance to OSI have been observed and
several resistant mechanisms of OSI have been identified,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

such as C797S mutation of EGFR, MET activation, and
RAS mutation [23, 31-33]. Unfortunately, no effective
drugs or therapy strategies were currently approved for
OSI-resistant NSCLC patients. Further identified the
resistant mechanisms of OSI in NSCLC patients were
necessary for development of new therapeutic drugs
or strategies. In the present study, we have identified a
novel resistant mechanism of OSI in NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells, that is, loss of EGFR expression. Loss of EGFR has
been identified as resistant mechanism for gefitinib (a first
generation EGFR inhibitor) [10]. This kind of resistant
mechanism of OSI suggested that patients might no longer
benefit from the EGFR TKIs or EGFR antibody.
The navitoclax is a potent small molecule inhibitor
of Bcl-2 family and numerous of studies indicated
that navitoclax exhibited therapeutic effect against
multiple types of cancers, including lung cancer, acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, and ovarian cancer etc. [3436]. So far, various ongoing trials of navitoclax alone
or in combination with other drugs were being explored
[37-39]. Here, we found that NCI-H197/OSIR cells were
more sensitivity to navitoclax and navitoclax-induced
cell viability inhibition and apoptosis could be reversed
by pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK. In addition, studies
suggested that cells transformed from NSCLC to small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) will be sensitivity to navitoclax, and
down-regulation of EGFR and RB were biomarkers for this
transform [11, 40]. However, the expression of RB protein
was similar in both NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR
cells (Supplementary Figure S1). More studies should be
detected to confirm the transform of NSCLC to SCLC and
the therapeutic effect of navitoclax in OSI-resistant cells.
In summary, NCI-H1975/OSIR cells presented
lower cell proliferation and higher cell migration and
invasion, compared with the parent cells. Cells resistance
to OSI showed resistance to other EGFR TKIs gefitinib,
erlotinib, afatinib, and rociletinib and chemotherapeutics
doxorubicin and fluorouracil, while sensitivity to
paclitaxel. The NCI-H1975/OSIR cells did not present
MDR phenotype. Loss of EGFR could pose as one of
the resistant mechanisms of NCI-H1975/OSIR cells to
OSI and navitoclax might be the candidate drug for OSIresistant NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
OSI, rociletinib, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib,
pemetrexed, navitoclax, and Z-VAD-FMK were purchased
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Paclitaxel,
doxorubicin, fluorouracil, paraformaldehyde (PFA),
MTT, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Crystal violet was
purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology CorporationShanghai (Shanghai, China). RPMI 1640 medium, fetal

Oncotarget

bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycinwere, and
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from
Gibco Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). The
primary antibodies, i.e. PCNA, MMP2, TIMP2, p-FAK
(Tyr397), FAK, p-Src (Tyr416), Src, p-Paxillin (Tyr118),
Paxillin, P-gp, p-EGFR (Tyr1068), EGFR, p-ERK
(Thr202/Tyr204), ERK, p-AKT (Ser473), AKT, c-PARP,
c-caspase 3, RB, GAPDH, and the responsive secondary
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA).

NCI-H1975/OSIR cells. Cells were treated with indicated
concentrations of OSI for 72 h and navitoclax for 48 h,
respectively. The medium was then replaced with drugfree medium and cells were further incubated for about
7 days. Cells were subsequently fixed using 4% PFA
and stained with crystal violet staining solution. Typical
images were photographed using an ordinary camera.
For quantifying assay, clones were dissolved in acetate
acid after crystal violet staining and shook for 10 min in
the dark. The absorbance at 590 nm was recorded with a
microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, 1420 Multilabel Counter
Victor3, Wellesley, MA, USA).

Cell line and culture
NSCLC NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR, L858R and
T790M) were obtained from Shanghai Cell Bank
(Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in a RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and antibiotics
(100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin).
Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.

Morphological change assay
Exponentially
growing
NCI-H1975
and
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were seeded onto 6-well plate.
After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cellular morphology
was observed with an AxioCam HRC CCD camera (Carl
Zeiss, Germany).

Establishment of OSI-resistant NCI-H1975 cells

Western blot assay

The OSI-resistant NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were
established as described previously [33]. NCI-H1975 cells
were exposed to 0.03 μM OSI for 72 h. Cells were then
incubated in drug-free medium until the surviving cells
had recovered and shown a normal exponential growth
rate. The cycles of selection were tested in the presence of
gradually increased concentrations of OSI from 0.03 μM
to 1.5 μM. After about 6 months, cells became resistant
to OSI. Surviving cells were harvested and propagated
in drug-free medium. The 21th passage cells were used
in the present study. The newly established OSI-resistant
cells were indicated as NCI-H1975/OSIR cells. During
the establishment of NCI-H1975/OSIR cells, the parental
NCI-H1975 cells were always cultured in drug-free
medium in parallel.

Western blot assay was conducted as described
previously [42]. Total protein was extracted and the
protein concentrations were evaluated with the BCATM
protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal
quantities of proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a
PVDF membrane, and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk.
The membrane was then probed with specific primary
antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After membranes were
washed with PBST, the membranes were incubated with
corresponding secondary antibodies at room temperature
for 1 h. The specific protein bands were visualized with
an ECL advanced western blot analysis detection kit (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA). Equal protein loading
was verified by probing with anti-GAPDH antibodies.

MTT assay

Migration and invasion assay

The effects of indicated agents on cell viabilities
of NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were studied
by MTT assay as described in the previous report [41].
Exponentially growing cells were seeded into 96-well
plates and cultured to about 70-80%. Cells were treated
with indicated concentrations of test compounds. Then,
fresh medium with 1 mg/mL MTT was added to the wells
and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. 100 μL of DMSO was
added to solubilize the formazan and shook for 10 min in
the dark. The absorbance at 570 nm was recorded with a
microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, 1420 Multilabel Counter
Victor3, Wellesley, MA, USA).

The migration and invasion of NCI-H1975 and
NCI-H1975/OSIR cells were studied in transwell
chambers (10 mm tissue culture transwell with an 8 μm
pore size polycarbonate membrane, 24-well companion
plate, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). The upper chamber
of a transwell insert was added with 100 μL PBS for
migration assay or 100 μL 1:6 mixture of matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA) : PBS for invasion assay and
dried for 1 h at 37 °C. The NCI-H1975 or NCI-H1975/
OSIR cells were seeded into each well of the upper
chamber. The lower chamber was filled 500 μL medium
with 10% FBS. After 24 h incubation, non-invading
cells that remained on the top aspect of the membrane
were removed. The invasive cells attached to the lower
surface of the membrane were fixed using 4% PFA at room
temperature for 30 min and stained with crystal violet.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded into 6-well plate at a density of
2,000 per well for NCI-H1975 cells and 3,000 per well for
