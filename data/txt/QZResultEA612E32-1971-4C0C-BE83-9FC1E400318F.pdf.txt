ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is highly malignant with limited therapy and a poor prognosis.
TRAIL-activating therapy has been promising, however, clinical trials have shown
resistance and limited responses of pancreatic cancers. We investigated the effects
of calmodulin(CaM) antagonists, trifluoperazine(TFP) and tamoxifen(TMX), on TRA8-induced apoptosis and tumorigenesis of TRA-8-resistant pancreatic cancer cells,
and underlying mechanisms. TFP or TMX alone did not induce apoptosis of resistant
PANC-1 cells, while they dose-dependently enhanced TRA-8-induced apoptosis. TMX
treatment enhanced efficacy of TRA-8 therapy on tumorigenesis in vivo. Analysis of
TRA-8-induced death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) identified recruitment of
survival signals, CaM/Src, into DR5-associated DISC, which was inhibited by TMX/
TFP. In contrast, TMX/TFP increased TRA-8-induced DISC recruitment/activation
of caspase-8. Consistently, caspase-8 inhibition blocked the effects of TFP/TMX
on TRA-8-induced apoptosis. Moreover, TFP/TMX induced DR5 expression. With a
series of deletion/point mutants, we identified CaM antagonist-responsive region
in the putative Sp1-binding domain between -295 to -300 base pairs of DR5 gene.
Altogether, we have demonstrated that CaM antagonists enhance TRA-8-induced
apoptosis of TRA-8-resistant pancreatic cancer cells by increasing DR5 expression
and enhancing recruitment of apoptotic signal while decreasing survival signals in
DR5-associated DISC. Our studies support the use of these readily available CaM
antagonists combined with TRAIL-activating agents for pancreatic cancer therapy.

Dysregulation of apoptosis of tumor cells plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer
and their resistance to therapies [5]. Apoptosis can be
initiated either from intracellular signals via mitochondria
through the intrinsic pathway, or from extracellular signals
via plasma membrane receptors through the receptormediated extrinsic pathway [6]. The intrinsic pathway is
mostly engaged by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs
and radiation therapy [7]. On the other hand, the extrinsic
pathway is initiated by activation of death receptors (DRs)
present on the cell surface, including the tumor necrosis
factor receptor (TNF-R), Fas death receptor (CD95),
and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)
receptors [8]. The possibility of targeting TNF-R and Fas
for tumor-specific killing has been limited due to systemic

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer
death in the USA [1]. The 5-year survival rate has only
improved from 2% to 6% in the past 30 years [2]. The only
potentially curative therapy for pancreatic cancer is surgical
resection. Unfortunately, even among those patients who
undergo resection for pancreatic cancer and have tumorfree margins, the 5-year survival rate after resection is 10%
to 25% [3]. Current chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine or
5-fluorouracil, coupled with radiotherapy may improve the
quality of life of some patients, but their survival benefit is
very limited [4]. Multi-drug resistance to chemotherapy is
a major obstacle to obtaining a better prognosis for patients
with pancreatic cancer.

toxicity and lack of selectivity for tumors over normal
tissues [9]. In contrast, TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been
demonstrated in a wide variety of tumor cells in vitro and
in vivo, and has been consistently highly selective for tumor
cells over normal cells [10]. Many recombinant TRAIL or
monoclonal antibodies to its receptors have been tested in
phase I–III clinical trials for their anti-tumor efficacy. Among
the antibodies for DR4 or DR5, conatumumab (AMG655,
antibody for DR5) [11] and tigatuzumab (CS-1008/TRA-8,
antibody for DR5) [12] are being tested for treatment of
pancreatic cancers (http://Clinicaltrials.gov). In general,
these agents have been well-tolerated, showing low toxicity
in patients in several clinical trials [10, 13]. However, clinical
trials with the TRAIL and DR4/5 agonist antibodies to date
have shown limited anti-tumor efficacy. Preclinical studies
have shown that many cancer cells are resistant to TRAILinduced cell death, especially some highly malignant tumors
such as pancreatic cancer [14]. Accordingly, resistance to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells remains a serious
clinical challenge. Better understanding of the molecular and
cellular mechanisms of TRAIL resistance is critical for the
successful application of TRAIL and DR4 or DR5 agonist
antibodies in cancer therapy.
TRAIL-induced apoptosis is initiated by binding
of TRAIL to its functional receptors (DR4 or DR5) that
triggers the assembly of the death-inducing signaling
complex (DISC), which in turn recruits the Fas-associated
death domain (FADD) and eventually leads to recruitment
and activation of initiating caspases at the DISC, including
caspase-8 and -10 [15]. FADD may also recruit survival
signals into the DISC, such as the enzymatically inactive
homologue of caspase-8, FLICE-like inhibitor protein
(FLIP), or Src kinase, and thus convert death receptoractivated apoptotic signals into survival signals [16]. In
addition, modulation of other components in the death
receptor-mediated signaling pathways, including increased
expression of TRAIL decoy death receptors (DcR1 and
DcR2), low expression or mutations of the functional
receptors, DR4 or DR5, or over-expression of antiapoptotic proteins, have been shown to contribute to the
resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL therapy [10]. However,
as many cancer cells express intact death receptors and the
components of apoptotic signaling pathway [14, 17, 18], the
mechanisms underlying the resistance of pancreatic cancer
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis are not fully understood.
We have previously demonstrated that calmodulin
(CaM) is recruited into the Fas death receptor-activated DISC
and binds to the survival signals FLIP and Src in the DISC,
thus mediating death receptor-mediated survival pathways
[19–23]. CaM is a small calcium binding protein that interacts
with a diverse group of cellular proteins and participates in
signaling pathways that regulate proliferation, motility and
differentiation [24]. We and others have shown that CaM
antagonists induce apoptosis of cancer cells, including
cholangiocarcinoma [21], lung adenocarcinoma [25] and
breast carcinomas [26], via decreasing activation of AKT
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and increasing activation of caspase-8 or down-regulation
of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and increase of the proapoptotic Bax protein. In pancreatic cancer cells, we have
demonstrated that CaM binding to Src in the DISC mediates
the survival signals activated by the Fas death receptor signals
[19]. The function of CaM in TRAIL-induced apoptosis is
unknown. In the present studies, we characterize the role
of CaM in TRA-8-induced apoptosis of resistant pancreatic
cells and the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that
CaM was recruited into DR5-activated DISC, which was
inhibited by CaM antagonists, trifluoparazine (TFP) and
tamoxifen (TMX). Although TFP or TMX alone did not
induce apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, they markedly
enhanced TRA-8-induced apoptosis of resistant pancreatic
cells. Mechanistic characterization demonstrated that TFP or
TMX inhibited the recruitment of the survival signal, Src, and
increased recruitment and activation of caspase-8 in the DR5activated DISC. Furthermore, CaM antagonists were found
to increase the expression of DR5, which may further lead
to enhanced DISC recruitment and activation of caspase-8.
These studies reveal a novel function and underlying
mechanisms of CaM in regulating TRA-8-induced apoptosis,
and support the use of the readily available CaM antagonists
to enhance therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL-resistant pancreatic
cancer to TRAIL-agonist therapy.

RESULTS
CaM antagonists promote TRA-8-induced
apoptosis in resistant pancreatic cancer cells
Using several pancreatic cancer cell lines, we have
demonstrated that the expression of DR5 does not consistently
correlate with the resistance to TRA-8 [27]. Our previous
studies have shown that CaM antagonists promote Fas death
receptor-induced apoptosis via regulating the apoptotic/survival
signals in the DISC [19]. To determine whether CaM may also
play a role in TRA-8-induced apoptosis, we characterized
the effects of two CaM antagonists, TFP and TMX, on
TRA-8-induced apoptosis in PANC-1 cells (Figure 1).
At the concentrations tested, up to 30 μM, neither TFP
(Figure 1Aa) nor TMX (Figure 1Ba) induced apoptosis
of  PANC-1 cells. In contrast, TFP and TMX enhanced TRA8-induced apoptosis in concentration-dependent manners
(Figure 1Aa & 1Ba). A time-dependent effect of TMX
on TRA-induced apoptosis was also demonstrated
(Supplementary Figure 1). Consistently, TFP and TMX
dramatically enhanced TRA-8-induced activation of caspase-8
and its downstream apoptotic effector caspase-3, as indicated
by the respective cleaved forms (Figure 1Ab & 1Bb).

apoptosis induced by TRA-8 combined with TFP or

determined that TFP and TMX-enhanced activation of
caspase-8 (Figure 2Ab & 2Bb, Control) were inhibited
by Z-IETZ-FMK (Figure 2Ab & 2Bb, Casp8 Inhibitor).
Decreased activation of caspsae-8 was associated with
inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Altogether, these
results demonstrate that CaM antagonists-enhanced TRA8-apoptosis of the resistant PANC-1 pancreatic cells is
mediated, at least in part, by the activation of caspase-8.

DR5 IP). Therefore, increased activation of caspase-8 in
the DISC by TMX and TFP was not due to their effects
on PARP-1. Further analysis of the DR5-associated
DISC identified the interaction of DR5 with CaM under
basal conditions, which was increased upon TRA-8
stimulation (Figure 3A & 3B). The CaM/DR5 interaction
was markedly inhibited by the CaM-antagonists, TFP and
TMX (Figure 3Aa & 3Ba, DR5 IP). In addition, TFP and
TMX inhibited the DISC recruitment of Src, a CaMassociated survival signal in pancreatic cancer cells that
we have previously reported [19]. Of note, the expression
of Src was not affected by TFP or TMX. The recruitment
of another survival signal, FLIP, into the DISC was not
affected by TFP or TMX, despite of some decrease in
FLIP protein in cells treated with high doses of TFP or
TMX. Notably, increased expression of DR5 was evident
in cells exposed to 25 μM of TFP or TMX (Figure 3Ab
& 3Bb, cell lysates).

CaM antagonists increase activation of caspase-8
and decrease CaM and Src in the DISC
We have previously shown that recruitment of the
poly-ADP-riboso polymerase (PARP-1) into the TRA8-activated DISC inhibits caspase-8 activation in the
DISC, which contributes to the resistance of PANC-1 to
TRA-8-induced apoptosis [27]. To determine whether
the effects of CaM antagonists on caspase-8 activation
were mediated by its regulation of PARP-1, we analyzed
the expression and recruitment of PARP-1 in the TRA-8
activated DISC. Neither TFP nor TMX affected PARP-1
expression (Figure 3Ab & 3Bb, cell lysates) or the
recruitment of PARP-1 into the DISC (Figure 3Aa & 3Ba,

analysis demonstrated that either TFP or TMX dosedependently increased the expression of DR5 protein
(Figure 4Aa, 4Ba). In addition, TFP and TMX induced the

gene is responsible for CaM antagonist-induced DR5
mRNA expression.
Analysis of the sequence between -290 to -373 of
DR5 gene identified two putative binding elements for
the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) [28],
which are located between -295 to -300bp and -300 to
-305bp (Figure 6A, DR5-373 underline). Mutation of 3
nucleotides in the first putative Sp1 binding site (DR5373-mut1) did not affect the luciferase activity under basal
conditions and upon TFP or TMX stimulation (Figure 6B).
In contrast, mutations of 3 cytosines overlapping the two
putative Sp1-binding elements (DR5-373-mut2) or in
the second putative Sp1-binding site (DR5-373-mut2)
abolished the induction of luciferase activity by TFP
(Figure 6Ba) or TMX (Figure 6Bb). Accordingly, the
second putative Sp1 binding region locating between
-295 to -300bp on the DR5 gene is responsive for CaM
antagonist-induced DR5 gene expression.

Identification of CaM antagonists-responsive
domain on DR5 gene
To determine the mechanisms underlying CaM
antagonist-induced DR5 mRNA expression, we
characterized the effects of CaM antagonists on the
transcriptional activity of the DR5 gene, using luciferase
reporters containing a series of deletion mutants of the
5′-flanking regions of DR5 (Figure 5A). TFP and TMX
markedly induced luciferase activity in PANC-1 cells
transfected with luciferase reporter constructs DR5-3070,
420 and 373 (Figure 5Ba, 5Bb). However, TFP and TMXinduced luciferase activity was dramatically decreased
in the DR5-290 and 189 transfected cells, and the basal
luciferase activity in these cells was also significantly
reduced compared with that in the DR5-3070 transfected
cells (Figure 5B & 5C). Taken together, the results indicate
that the region located between -290 to -373 on the DR5

DISCUSSION

of TRA-8, TMX and TRA-8 plus TMX on PANC-1
tumorigenesis a mouse xenograft model. Similar to our
previous observation [27], TRA-8 alone was not effective
in inhibiting PANC-1 tumorigenesis (Figure 7A, 7B).
TMX by itself did not affect tumor growth (Figure 7A,
7B), which is consistent with the in vitro observation
that TMX alone did not induce apoptosis (Figure 1B).
In contrast, TMX significantly enhanced the efficacy
of TRA-8 treatment (Figure 7A, 7B). The inhibitory
effects of TRA-8 combined with TMX on tumor growth
was pronounced at 3 weeks and further enhanced at 5
weeks (Figure 7A). The effects of TMX to increased
DR5 expression of tumors was determined by Western
blots analysis of tumor tissues (Figure 7C). Increased
activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, as indicated by
cleaved caspase-8 and 3, was determined in tumors
treated with TRA-8 combined with TMX (Figure 7C),
indicating increased tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore,
TUNEL staining of tumor sections demonstrated
significant increases in cell death in the tumors from
mice treated with the combination of TMX and TRA8 (Figure 7D). These results demonstrate that TMX
also increases DR5 expression and induces apoptosis
in tumors, and thus enhancing the efficacy of TRA-8
therapy.

Activating TRAIL-induced apoptosis for cancer
therapy has been actively investigated in a variety of
cancers (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). However, phase
I–II clinical trials with recombinant TRAIL and agonistic
antibodies for the TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5, have
shown only isolated responses and limited overall effects
on tumor progression [11, 12, 29, 30], indicating resistance
of tumor cells to TRAIL-induced cell death. The present
work demonstrate that CaM antagonists enhance TRAILinduced apoptosis in resistant pancreatic cancer cells via
novel mechanisms, which supports the use of these readily
available drugs as promising interventions to improve the
efficacy of TRAIL therapy.
Using two potent CaM antagonists, TFP and TMX,
we have characterized the ability of CaM antagonists to
enhance TRA-8-induced apoptosis in two TRA-8-resistant
pancreatic cancer cell lines. The effects of CaM antagonists
on TRA-8-induced apoptosis is not due to their toxicity or
via stimulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways
as seen in other cancer cells [31], as neither TFP nor
TMX alone was found to affect the survival or apoptosis
of the TRA-8 resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines. In
contrast, CaM antagonists enhanced TRA-8-induced

apoptosis by modulating the extrinsic apoptosis pathways
via increasing the DR5-associated DISC recruitment and
activation of caspase-8. Such an observation is similar
to our previous report that CaM antagonists promote
Fas death receptor-induced apoptosis via the extrinsic
apoptosis pathways mediated by caspase-8 activation
[22, 32]. Furthermore, TMX markedly enhanced the
efficacy of TRA-8 therapy on tumorigenesis of the
resistant PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells in vivo, which

was associated with increased expression of DR-5 and
increased activation of the caspase-8.
Analysis of the DR5-associated DISC identified
the interaction of CaM and DR5 in the pancreatic cancer
cell lines that was increased in response to TRA-8. These
results in pancreatic cancer cells differ from our previous
report in non-cancerous jurkat cells in which CaM did
not interact with TRAIL death receptors [33]. In the Fasactivated DISC, we have demonstrated that the recruitment

of CaM into the DISC facilitates the recruitment of
survival signals, including the FLIP and Src [19–22, 32],
which may contribute to the effects of CaM antagonists on
enhancing Fas-induced apoptosis [21, 22]. Similarly, FLIP
and Src were found to be recruited into the DR5-associated
DISC. However, CaM antagonists inhibit the recruitment
of both FLIP and Src in the Fas-activated DISC, whereas
CaM antagonists only inhibited the recruitment of Src,
but not FLIP, into the DR5-associated DISC. Considering
also that the expression of FLIP is very low in TRA-8resistant PANC-1 cells [27], these results suggested that
FLIP may not play a key role in mediating the effects of
CaM antagonists on enhancing TRA-8-induced apoptosis.
The precise function of Src in the DR5-associated
DISC has not been determined yet. We have demonstrated
that CaM-mediated Src recruitment into the Fas-activated
DISC in pancreatic cancer cells is associated with Src
phosphorylation/activation and cell survival [19]. In Hela
cells, Src activation has been demonstrated to inhibit
caspase-8 activation, via phosphorylating caspase-8
at tyrosine 380 that inhibits caspase-8 cleavage [34].
In addition, Src inhibition is associated with increased
caspase-8 cleavage, which contributes to increased
apoptosis in TRAIL resistant hepatic carcinoma cells
[35]. Accordingly, recruitment of Src, via CaM, into the
death receptor-activated DISC may provide the proximity
for Src to phosphorylate caspase-8, which inhibits
caspase-8 cleavage and activation as seen in Hela cells.
Consistently, we have found that CaM antagonist, TFP,
decreases CaM binding to Src, which inhibits Fas-induced
recruitment of Src into the DISC and Src phosphorylation
at tyrosine 416 that are key to its activation [19].
Therefore, inhibition of Src recruitment and activation
in the DR5-associated DISC by CaM antagonists may
contribute to CaM antagonist enhancement of TRA8-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we have recently
reported that TRA-8-induced DISC recruitment of PARP1 regulates caspase-8 activation in the DISC [27], which
is accompanied by enhanced sensitivity of pancreatic
cancer cell to TRA-8-induced apoptosis. However, CaM
antagonists did not affect PARP-1 expression or the
recruitment of PARP-1 into TRA-8-induced DISC. Thus,
CaM antagonists-enhanced caspase-8 activation and
apoptosis is not mediated by PARP-1.
Our studies have further identified a novel
mechanism whereby CaM antagonists enhance TRA-8induced apoptosis by inducing the expression of DR5.
Although the correlation between the basal expression
levels of the functional death receptors, DR4 or DR5,
and the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL treatment
has not been demonstrated [27, 36, 37], our results are
consistent with previous observations that upregulation
of DR4 and DR5 enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in a variety of cancers [38–40]. Furthermore, results
from our studies have provided new mechanistic
insights into CaM antagonist-indued DR5 expression.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We demonstrated that CaM antagonists enhanced
the expression of DR5 in pancreatic cancer cells, but
not the other TRAIL functional receptor, DR4. The
CaM antagonist-responsive region was localized
between -295 and -300 bp in the 5′ flanking region
of the DR5 gene, a putative binding element of the
specificity protein 1 (Sp1). In addition to Sp1 [41–43],
other transcription factors that have been reported to
modulate DR5 transcription include the nuclear factor
κB [44], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous
protein [45], activator protein 1 [46] and Yin Yang 1
[47]. However, no putative binding elements for the
other transcription factors were identified in the CaM
antagonist-responsive region. Of note, previous studies
have demonstrated that activation of Sp1 is unique for
transcriptional regulation of DR5 without affecting
DR4 expression in other cancer cells, including colon
[41], hepatoma [43] and ovarian cancer cells [42].
Consistently, site-direct mutagenesis studies further
support a unique and important role of Sp1 in mediating
CaM-antagonist-induced upregulation of DR5.
In summary, we have demonstrated that CaM
antagonists, TFP and TMX, enhance TRA-8-induced
apoptosis in TRA-8-resistant pancreatic cancer cell
lines. CaM antagonists induce DR5 expression via
two putative Sp1 binding elements spanning -295 to
-305 bp of DR5 gene, and increase recruitment and
activation of apoptotic signal, caspase-8, and decrease
survival signals, CaM and Src, in the TRA-8-activated
DISC. This novel regulatory role of CaM in the DR5associated DISC may present a unique opportunity for
the use of these readily available and well tolerated CaM
antagonists, TMX and TFP, in combination with DR5
agonists to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TRAILresistant pancreatic cancer.

and BglII restriction sites of the pGL3-basic reporter
vector. Specific primers include the reverse primer,
5′-CTTAAGATCTGGCGGTAGGGAACGCTCTTATAG
TC-3′; and the forward primers: 5′-CTTAGG
TACCTGGACGCGCTTGCGGAGGATTGCGT-3′ (pG
L3-DR5–290); 5′-CTTAGGTACCCGAATGAC GCCTGC
CCGGAGGCAGT-3′ (pGL3-DR5-189); and 5′-CTTAG
GTACCAAGTCAGCCTGGACACA TAAATCAG-3′ (pG
L3-DR5-142). Point mutations were made by replacing the
nucleic acids with adenine using the QuikChange II SiteDirected Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) and confirmed by sequence analysis. Specific
primers are 5′-5′-TTAGTTCCGGTCCCTTCCAAACCCC
TCCCCACTTGGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCCAAGTGGGGA
GGGGTTTGGAAGGGACCGGAACTAA-3′ (DR5-Sp1

To determine luciferase activity, PANC-1 Cells
at 70–80% confluence were co-transfected with pGL3DR5 reporter plasmids and a plasmid expressing
the venilla luciferase (as a control for transfection
efficiency) using Lipofectamine 2000. Media were
changed 24 hours after transfection, and cells were
treated with TMX and TFP for 16 hours. Luciferase
activity was measured with Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System [50].

Assessment of apoptosis
Cells were exposed to TRA-8, TMX and TFP for the
times and concentrations indicated in the figure legends.
Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining
(BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by flow
cytometry (BD Biosciences).

Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted, quantified with a BCA
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA),
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon
P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) as described
previously [27]. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat
milk and incubated with primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies in the blocking buffer were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature. Signals were detected using Immobilon
Western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase
substrate detection kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation of DISC proteins was
performed as we described previously [27]. Cells were
suspended and incubated with TRA-8 for 1 hour at 37°C.
Protein extracts (1000 μg) was then incubated with
1 μg of anti-DR5 antibody for 1 hour and subsequently
incubated with 50 μL of 1:1 slurry of protein G-agarose
beads overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed, and
20 μL 2 × Laemmli sample buffer was added to the
beads followed by heating at 95°C for 5 minutes and
chilling on ice. After brief centrifugation, proteins in
the supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting with
indicated antibodies.

Mouse xenograft model

Real-time PCR analysis

The animal protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. Male athymic
nu/nu mice (6 weeks old, NCI-Frederick) were used
for tumor inoculation as we previously reported [27].
Briefly, PANC-1 cells (2 × 106 in 200 mL PBS/site)
were inoculated subcutaneously into the both flanks
of mice. Five days after tumor inoculation, mice were
divided into four groups(8 mice/group): a control group
injected with 0.9% sodium chloride and three treatment

Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagents
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen
Carlsbad, CA). The reverse transcription reaction was
performed on 1 μg of total RNA using the First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD). Realtime PCR for DR4, DR5 and GAPDH was performed
and analyzed using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) in a Bio-Rad CFX96-Cycler as we
previously described [49].

groups intraperitoneally injected with TMX (15 mg/kg,
2 consecutive days/week), TRA-8 (200 μg/mice, once/
week), or the combination (TMX plus TRA-8). The tumor
size was measured every week and tumor volumes were
determined using the formula volume = length × width2/2.
At the end of the experiment, tumors were removed from
mice and homogenized for Western blot analysis.

TUNEL staining was performed on tumor sections
(7 μm) (DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System;
Promega) to determine cell death, and DAPI staining
(4′, 6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) was
used to identify nuclei. Stained specimens were examined
microscopically (Leica M165 FC). For quantitative
analysis, cell numbers were counted under a microscope
(× 200). Four fields in each slide were counted and the
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined.
