ABSTRACT
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease with an estimated incidence
of only 0.7 new cases per million per year. Approximately 30-70% of the patients
present with advanced disease with very poor prognosis and without effective
therapeutic options. In the recent years, unprecedented progresses in cancer biology
and genomics have fostered the development of numerous targeted therapies for
various malignancies. Immunotherapy has also transformed the treatment landscape
of malignancies such as melanoma, among others. However, these advances have
not brought meaningful benefits for patients with ACC. Extensive genomic analyses
of ACC have revealed numerous signal transduction pathway aberrations (e.g.,
insulin growth factor receptor and Wnt/β-catenin pathways) that play a central role
in pathophysiology. These molecular alterations have been explored as potential
therapeutic targets for drug development. This manuscript summarizes recent
discoveries in ACC biology, reviews the results of early clinical studies with targeted
therapies, and provides the rationale for emerging treatment strategies such as
immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

5%.[4-7] The pathologic diagnosis of ACC is based on
multiple morphologic parameters that are suggestive but
not pathognomonic of malignancy.[8-10] The most widely
used diagnostic score are known as Weiss criteria, with
several updates, and includes the following parameters:
mitosis, atypical mitosis, necrosis, venous invasion,
sinusal invasion, capsular invasion, nuclear atypia,
diffuse architecture, and clear cell change.[8, 9] Molecular
analyses have been recently attempted in helping
diagnosis, in particular hypermethylation, miRNA, TP53,
ZNRF3, β-catenin are possible candidates that could
help diagnose and establish prognosis, but are not yet
used in current pathologic diagnosis.[11] About 40-60%
of patients with malignant tumors of the adrenal glands

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an exceedingly
rare malignancy with no effective standard treatment
options. ACC is responsible for 0.2% of all cancer deaths
in the United States and has an estimated incidence of
0.7 cases per million per year.[1] The disease incidence
has a bimodal distribution with peaks in the first and
fourth decades of life, and a female to male ratio 1.52.5:1.[2, 3] A growing number of patients are noted to
have asymptomatic, indolent adrenal incidentalomas
after undergoing abdominal imaging; in this patient
population, the estimated incidence of ACC is as high as

present with symptoms related to excessive hormonal
production such as hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism.
[2, 12]
Most cases of ACC are sporadic with no identifiable
risk factor. Rarely, ACC can be part of tumor hereditary
syndromes associated with specific germ line mutations,
namely Li-Fraumeni (TP53 gene mutation) or Lynch
syndrome (mutations in various mismatch repair genes).
[13-15] Case reports have also suggested an increased
risk of ACC in multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome
type 1 (MEN1) and familial adenomatous polyposis.[16]
Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients presenting
with resectable disease and is often followed by adjuvant
chemotherapy with mitotane to mitigate the risk of
disease recurrence in high-risk patients despite the lack
of prospective data to support this approach.[17] The
group of approximately 30-70% of patients presenting
with unresectable metastatic disease carry an extremely
poor prognosis related to the aggressive biological
behavior and the lack of effective therapeutic options.[2,
12] Mitotane, which contains cytotoxic and anti-steroid
synthesis activity properties, has been the corner stone
of the treatment of advanced disease for decades.[18, 19]
Limited benefit from polychemotherapy contributes to the
dismal prognosis of advanced disease with an estimated
5-year survival rate of less than 15%.[20]
Major advances in the understanding of the
genetic pathophysiology of cancer have led to significant
advancement in the treatment of several malignancies
including the development of effective targeted
therapies.[21] Investigation of the genomic landscape
of ACC revealed that it is a biologically and genetically
heterogeneous malignancy with transcriptome clusters
associated with distinct clinical behaviors.[11] These
studies also demonstrated potential therapeutic targets that
will be reviewed in this manuscript.

the decision to use mitotane alone or in combination with
other drugs.[30-32] A few studies have also addressed the
expression of ribonucleotide reductase large subunit and
excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1)
in ACC at the protein level by immunohistochemistry, and
determined the association of the expression with clinical
outcome and response to mitotane and cytotoxic therapy,
but the results are inconsistent.[33-35]
The only chemotherapy based phase III randomized
clinical trial ever conducted in advanced ACC showed
that mitotane combined with etoposide, doxorubicin and
cisplatin (EDPM) provided additional clinical benefit
compared to mitotane plus streptozocin.[36] The patients
randomized to receive EDPM had higher tumor response
rates when compared to patients treated with streptozocin
combined with mitotane (23% vs. 9%). Prolongation of
progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed in the
EDPM arm (5 vs. 2 months). There was no significant
benefit in overall survival (OS) (14 vs. 12 months).
It is important to emphasize that up to 58% of patients
receiving EDPM had serious adverse events compared to
41% in the mitotane plus streptozocin arm.
The cytotoxic mechanism of action as well
as resistance mechanisms to mitotane are not well
understood.[24] Mitotane is also generally not well
tolerated as monotherapy and levels > 14 mcg/ml are
associated with better antitumor response.[37] It is
important to review that mitotane is a strong cytochrome
P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer and this may lead to
significant drug interactions and decrease the activity of
combination strategies.
The results of the FIRM-ACT phase III trial
showing modest improvement of disease control with
polychemotherapy and the high frequency of serious
adverse events stresses the pressing need for more
effective therapies. Furthermore in light of the rate of
serious adverse events there is no clear evidence that a
combination of cytotoxic agents with mitotane is better
than a sequential strategy.

CURRENT TREATMENT APPROACH
Mitotane, the only FDA-approved drug for ACC,
displays single-agent activity (10-30% tumor response
rates) based on its adrenolytic activity but its broad clinical
use is challenged by an unfavorable toxicity profile.[2224] The published trials on mitotane monotherapy activity
are for the most part retrospective. Only two prospective
trials have been reported with less than 20 patients each
with no clear survival benefit.[25, 26] Polychemotherapy
has also limited efficacy in advanced disease with smalluncontrolled studies showing response rates of 10-33%.
[27-29]
There have been a few studies of potential
biomarkers to help identify patients who may benefit
from mitotane and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. In
the adjuvant setting, establishing the tumor proliferation
index by Ki-67 labeling, with a cutoff of 10% dividing
two groups of patients with high and low risk, may help in

POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS
Insulin growth factor (IGF)/mTOR signaling
Insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R)
is a transmembrane cellular receptor which has a
heterotetrameric structure, characterized by two
‘half receptors’, each of which in turn comprises a
predominately extracellular α-chain that is involved in
ligand binding and a predominately intracellular β-chain
that includes the tyrosine kinase domain.[38]
Activation of the IGF-1R by one of its ligands
insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), encoded by a gene that
is located among a gene cluster on chromosome 11p15 and

that undergoes genomic imprinting, results in activation
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade and the RAS-MAPK
pathway leading to stimulation of protein translation and
cell proliferation (Figure 1).[39]
Chromosome 11p15 abnormalities are present
in up to 90% of sporadic ACCs and IGF2 is commonly
overexpressed in this tumor.[40] In fact both IGF2 mRNA
and protein are overexpressed in more than 90% of ACC,
with a good correlation between mRNA and protein.[41]
Mounting evidence suggest that overproduction of IGF2
is due to uniparental disomy or loss of imprinting of the
maternal allele.[42, 43] Moreover, IGF2 is expressed
differently in ACC when compared adrenocortical
adenomas or normal adrenal cortex tissue.[44] It has been
hypothesized that IGF2 overexpression is low or absent
in the beginning of oncogenesis, which may suggest that
other signaling pathways may also play a role in the ACC
tumorigenesis.[43]
Evidence also suggests that the IGF-1R plays a
pivotal role in ACC pathophysiology representing an
important therapeutic target in advanced ACC.[43, 45]
Indeed, the IGF2 gene and protein expression has been
associated with aggressive clinic-pathological features
of ACC when assessed by immunohistochemistry and
gene expression arrays (i.e., high grade and metastatic

disease).[44, 46] These results provided the rationale and
fostered the clinical development of anti-IGF antibodies
for treatment of this disease.
Linsitinib, an oral small molecule inhibitor of both
the IGF-1R and the insulin receptor, generated significant
enthusiasm based on early clinical results. In a phase I
trial, 14 patients with refractory ACC were treated with
3 intermittent dosing schedules of linsitinib.[47] Two out
of the 9 patients had partial responses and remained in
the study for 703 and 199 days, respectively. A doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial evaluated
the efficacy of linsitinib in 139 previously treated patients
with advanced ACC.[48] The study was prematurely
stopped due to the failure of linsitinib to improve PFS or
OS compared to placebo (median OS: 323 vs. 356 days;
HR 0.94; p = 0.77).
Of note 90% of patients in the linsitinib arm had
been exposed to mitotane based chemotherapy in the
metastatic setting. A short mitotane wash out period could
have affected linsitinib efficacy due interaction through
CYP3A4.[49] Also despite reported equivalent levels of
IGF-1 in active linsitinib and placebo groups question
remains if linsitinib reached its target. Finally, IGF-1R
might not be a major driver of adrenocortical carcinoma.
Overexpression of IGF-2 could represent a bystander

Figure 1: IGF-1R and Wnt/Frizzled receptor pathways. A. In adrenocortical carcinoma cells IGF2 binds to IGF1 receptor

(IGF1R) family. IGF-1R has a tetrameric structure in which the intra-cellular β-chain tyrosine kinase activity regulated by ligand binding
to extra-cellular α chain. Downstream of these receptors are the well-known Akt and MAPK intracellular signaling networks, which when
activated promote cell proliferation. B. The Wnt proteins, by binding to frizzled receptors and the LRP co-receptor, act to suppress the
activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). ZNRF3 promotes degradation of Wnt receptor functioning as tumor suppressors. This
prevents phosphorylation of downstream molecules allowing β-catenin association with Tcf/Lef in the nucleus and subsequent increased
cell proliferation.

effect caused by dysregulation of another gene at 11p15,
including, p57Kip2 or other transcripts at the loci.[50,
51] Finally, ACC could be driven by multiple pathway
aberrations requiring combination targeted therapies as
discussed below.
Figitumumab, a fully human IgG2 monoclonal
antibody that targets the IGF-1R, was tested in a phase
I dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid
tumors.[52, 53] After a total of 50 cycles of figitumumab
administered, no responses were documented among the
14 patients with previous treated metastatic ACC and no
patients had stable disease lasting more than 6 months.
Cixutumumab (IMC-A12), another antibody with high
affinity to IGF-1R, was evaluated in combination with
mitotane as first-line treatment among 20 patients with
metastatic ACC. A partial response was observed in
one patient (5%) and the trial was terminated due to
slow accrual and low response rates. The most common
toxicities mirrored the ones commonly seen with mitotane
alone, namely diarrhea and neurological complications.
[54] Cixutumumab was also tested in combination with
the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for the treatment of
42 patients with advanced solid tumors in a phase I trial.
Four out of 10 patients with ACC had stable disease
lasting longer than 8 months, prompting the opening
of an ACC expansion cohort that included 26 patients.
[55] There were no partial or complete responses, but
42% achieved stable disease for at least 6 months. The
combination was relatively well tolerated with toxicities
known to be associated with temsirolimus including
mucositis, thrombocytopenia, hypertrygliceridemia,
hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia.[56]
These results highlight the therapeutic potential of
combinatorial strategies and the possible role of mTOR
inhibitors. In fact, De Martino et al. recently evaluated
the expression of mTOR and downstream molecules in
ACC and showed activation of the pathway in a subset
of tumors.[57] Nevertheless, single-agent everolimus,
another mTOR inhibitor, showed no signal of clinical
activity in an exploratory study of 4 patients with
advanced ACC.[58]

Axitinib (AG-013736) is an oral, potent, and
selective oral inhibitor of VEGFR tyrosine kinases 1,
2, 3.[62] In phase II study, axitinib administered to 13
patients with metastatic or locally advanced ACC resulted
in no responses.[63] Sorafenib, an inhibitor of several
tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFR2, VEGFR3,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and
RAF-1, was investigated in a phase II trial in combination
with paclitaxel for patients with advanced disease and
showed no clinical activity. [64] [65] Sunitinib, another
multikinase inhibitor with activity against VEGFR and
PDGFR, was also investigated in a phase II trial with
35 patients with refractory ACC.[66] There were no
documented tumor responses and the median PFS was
2.8 months.[67] However sunitinib serum levels might
have been reduced by mitotane induced CYP3A4 activity
attenuating its antitumor activity and adverse effects.
Lastly, bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, was
given in combination with capecitabine to 10 patients with
locally advanced or metastatic disease after treatment
with mitotane and at least one line of chemotherapy led
to no meaningful clinical benefit was observed.[68] These
results document the limited clinical efficacy of these
VEGF and VEGFR inhibitors for the treatment of ACC.
Nonetheless pre-clinical data suggest increased efficacy
of antiangiogenic therapy with sunitinib when combined
with ERK pathway inhibitor in ACC indicating that
further antiangiogenic therapy may indeed show antitumor
efficacy.[69]

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
signaling pathway
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was one of
the first identified polypeptide growth factors identified
that signals through a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor
to stimulate various cellular functions including growth,
proliferation, and differentiation. Since then, several
related genes have been identified constituting a family
of ligands (primarily PDGF-α and -β) and their cognate
receptors (PDGFR-α and -β) have been identified. PDGFR
expression has been demonstrated in a number of solid
tumors including ACC.[70, 71] These results suggested
that imatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the c-ABL,
PDGFR and stem cell ligand receptor (c-KIT) tyrosine
kinases, could potentially have activity in ACC. A phase
II study testing imatinib in patients with metastatic solid
tumors expressing PDGFR or c-KIT included 4 patients
with metastatic ACC, but none of those patients showed
clinical response to therapy.[71] On the other hand,
another study exploring the combination of imatinib with
dacarbazine and capecitabine, in patients with advanced
endocrine malignancies documented tumor responses in 2
out of 7 patients with metastatic ACC.[72]

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
pathway
The family of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors (VEGFRs) plays a central role in tumor
angiogenesis. Of the three VEGFRs, VEGFR1 (fms-like
tyrosine kinase-1), VEGFR2 (fetal liver kinase-1/kinase
insert domain receptor), and VEGFR3 (fms-like tyrosine
kinase-4), VEGFR2 has the most significant role in
mediating the growth of blood vessels necessary for tumor
growth.[59] Activation of the VEGFR pathway has been
well documented in ACC and provides the rationale for
targeting these receptors.[60, 61]

chain fatty acyl-CoA in adrenal glands and is important
in creating a reservoir of substrate for steroid biosynthesis
making this enzyme a potential therapeutic target for
ACC. A selective inhibitor of ACAT1 (ATR-101-001)
is currently undergoing investigation in a phase I study
recruiting patients with advanced ACC (NCT01898715).
[84, 85] Based on the premise that many ACCs require
substantial intracellular cholesterol as a substrate for
steroidogenesis, drugs capable of disrupting cholesterol
uptake have therapeutic potential in ACC. In fact,
synthetic high-density lipoprotein (HDL) nanoparticles
that inhibit the cholesterol transporters SR-BI inhibited
cortisol production in ACC cell lines and enhanced the
apoptosis induced by etoposide, cisplatin or mitotane.
[86] Synthetic HDL nanoparticles are undergoing active
investigation as novel anti-cancer agents and hold promise
for the treatment of ACC.[87, 88]
Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is a nuclear
transcription factor critical in the development of
steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal glands.[89]
SF-1 also induces proliferation of ACC cell lines and
tumor growth in vivo.[90] SF-1 inhibitors inhibited
the proliferation elicited by SF-1 overexpression in
vitro suggesting a possible therapeutic potential.[91]
Furthermore, increased expression of SF-1 among 167
ACC tumors was associated with worse prognosis
independent of tumor staging.[92] The ongoing expansion
of knowledge regarding SF-1 regulated genes may lead to
novel therapeutic targets.[93]

EGFR family is part of a complex signaltransduction network that is central to several critical
cellular processes.[73] EGFR has been show to be
overexpressed in ACC when compared to adrenal
adenomas and normal tissue suggesting the potential
use of EGFR expression as a marker of malignancy.
[74, 75]. EGFR amplification by FISH and polysomy
of chromosome 7 are noted to be more frequent in ACC
specimens compared to adrenocortical adenomas.[76]
Sequencing of the EGFR gene in 30 cases did not reveal
mutations that are usually associated with response to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib.[75]
Nevertheless, inhibition of EGFR signaling was able to
reduce cell viability in ACC lines in vitro.[77] Ten patients
with heavily pretreated metastatic ACC were treated with
erlotinib and gemcitabine, but clinical activity was seen
in only one patient with reduction in the size of liver
metastasis leading to PFS of 8 months. [78] Despite the
frequent expression of EGFR, the rarity of activating
mutations predictive of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) makes unlikely that this class of drugs
will be clinically effective for ACC.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
signaling

FUTURE POTENTIAL TARGETS

Genetic studies have identified disturbances in
other signaling pathways such as the FGFR cascade.
[79, 80] For instance, FGFR4 has been found to be
overexpressed in ACC, particularly in the pediatric
population.[81] FGFR4 expression was assessed in 57
ACC tumors with overexpression demonstrated in 65%
of specimens. In adults, FGFR4 overexpression and
amplification (identified in 13% of pediatric tumors and
30% of adults) was associated with worse outcomes.[82]
A phase II trial investigating the efficacy of dovitinib, a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor with nonselective activity against
the FGFR, included 17 patients with unresectable ACC.
[83] One partial response was documented but 23% of
patients achieved stable disease lasting >6 months. These
preliminary results support the current investigation of the
potential role of selective FGFR inhibitors for treatment of
ACC, particularly in tumors with FGFR overexpression or
carrying other genetic aberrations such as amplifications,
activating mutations or gene fusions.

Wnt/β-catenin
β-catenin is an important component of the adrenal
cortex differentiation through the Wnt signaling pathway.
[94] After translocation into the nucleus, β-catenin along
with the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (Tcf/
Lef) family of transcription factors induces Wnt target
gene expression.[95, 96] The most common genetic
alteration identified among 77 ACC tumors by exome
sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
array analysis were homozygous deletions in the ZNRF3
gene.[11] This gene encodes a cell surface E3 ubiquitin
ligase and is a potential new tumor suppressor gene
related to the β-catenin pathway. Other mutations in genes
of the β-catenin pathway detected in ACC included APC
(2%) and CTNNB1 (β-catenin gene) (16%) found in 30%
of analyzed tumors.[11] In addition, β-catenin nuclear
expression assessed by immunohistochemistry and the
presence of mutations in the CTNNB1 and APC genes
represented independent prognostic factors in patients
with resected ACC.[97] The therapeutic potential of this

pathway was suggested by pre-clinical data showing that
a small-molecule inhibitor of the Tcf/β-catenin complex
(PKF115-584) induced apoptosis in ACC cell lines
carrying mutations in β-catenin.[98] While there have been
significant advances in therapeutic strategies targeting the
Wnt pathway, we are not aware of any preliminary clinical
results or ongoing trials specific for ACC.[99] Conversely,
pre-clinical data support that Wnt/β-catenin pathway
targeted therapy with anti-Wnt monoclonal antibody can
induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells and
suppress tumor growth in xenograft model.[100, 101] In
addition, interactions between the Wnt/β-catenin and other
important intracellular pathways have been proposed.
For instance, inhibition of γ-secretase, which is a key
component in the Notch extra-cellular signal transduction
pathway showed significant anti-tumor activity in patients
desmoid tumors (ORR 71.4%) in a phase I trial.[102, 103]
CTNNB1 mutations are observed is as much as 85% of
desmoid tumors, which may indicate potential interactions
between the Notch and Wnt/ β-catenin pathways.[104]

consequent to the enhanced levels of ERβ which stimulate
the expression of FasL interacting with activating protein
(AP)-1 sites located within its promoter sequence.[109]
Further exploration of the ER pathway and its interaction
with other cellular biologic processes in ACC may be of
potential interest.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/ c-Met pathway
c-Met is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor
naturally activated by its ligand HGF. Activation of this
pathway through mutations or overexpression can lead
to cellular proliferation and metastasis in several solid
tumors.[112] Also, c-Met expression in solid tumors
has been associated with a more aggressive cancer
phenotype.[113-115] Transcriptome analysis of ACC
cells documented activation of the c-Met pathway in ACC
cells, and treatment of ACC cells with HGF increased cell
proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.[116] Consistent with
these results, cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with
activity against VEGF-R and c-Met inhibited ACC tumor
growth in vivo.[116] To the best of our knowledge, there
are no clinical data showing efficacy of c-Met pathway
inhibitors for the treatment of ACC, but these preliminary
results support further investigation.

DNA methylation
DNA methylation has been studied in ACC.[40]
The methylation patterns of CpG islands in promoter
regions were analyzed in 51 ACC and 84 adrenal adenoma
specimens. Two unsupervised hierarchical clusters of
methylation profiles were identified and the global level
of methylation was significantly associated with survival.
Among the 25 genes with an inverse correlation between
methylation and expression were H19, GSTM1, GSTP1,
G0S2.[105] These findings are consistent with results
showing reduced expression of H19 in ACC as a function
of loss of maternal allele with the duplication of paternal
allele, leading to biallelic expression of IGF2 gene and
decrease in H19 and p57kip2 expression.[45, 50] Also,
ACC cells lines were treated with the cytosine methylation
inhibitor 5-aza-2’-deoxycytine as an attempt to reduce the
methylation of H19 promoter and thereby increase its
expression. Indeed, the treatment increased H19 mRNA
expression, inhibited IGF-2 mRNA and decreased cellular
proliferation.[106] These results provide a rationale to
further investigate the efficacy of DNA demethylating
agents in ACC.

MicroRNAs
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA
molecules that are involved in cellular processes related
to post-transcriptional regulation, and some have recently
been correlated with the development and progression of
various neoplasms.[117] In ACC, global alterations and
deregulations in the expression of miRNAS have been
reported.[118, 119] While most studies have attempted
to identify miRNAs that could help to distinguishing
adenomas from ACC or other tumors, a few recent studies
have addressed the potential roles of these molecules in
predicting response to therapy. For example, both miR483-5p and miR-7, have been shown to regulate the
expression of apoptotic pathways, making these molecules
attractive for anticancer therapy.[120, 121]

Immune system

Estrogen receptors

Studies investigating immunotherapy strategies
in ACC provide preliminary evidence that anti-tumor
immune response could be of relevance. Based on the
wide expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory
protein (StAR) in adrenal tissue and ACC cell models, a
specific immune response against this antigen was elicited
using an immunization protocol with DNA plasmids and
recombinant vaccinia virus vectors and resulted in an
anti-tumor effect in a xenograft model utilizing tumor cell

There is evidence in solid tumors of an interaction
between the IGF signaling pathway and estrogens.[107,
108] ACC cell model (H295R) showed that estrogen
receptor ERβ is significantly more expressed then ERα.
[109] Tumor tissue PCR and immunohistochemistry based
analysis showed that ERβ is present in normal adrenal
gland tissue and ACC.[110, 111] In addition, the apoptotic
effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen in H295R cells may be

line expressing StAR.[122-125] Another study describing
vaccination of two patients with metastatic ACC using
autologous dendritic cells pulsed with autologous tumor
lysate showed tumor-specific immune response in spite of
excessive production of glucocorticoids by the tumor.[126]
The anti-neoplastic activity resulting from immunotherapy
strategies (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors anti-CTLA-4 and
anti-PD-1 antibodies) for the treatment of solid tumors
such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer has
driven the interest to explore its potential clinical efficacy
in ACC.[127-130] Tumor membrane and tumor infiltrating
mononuclear cells were assessed for PD-L1 expression
through immunohistochemistry in 27 patients with
resected ACC. There was no correlation between PD-L1
expression and overall survival, higher tumor grade or
stage at diagnosis.[131] The role of immune checkpoints
in the pathophysiology of ACC and its possible therapeutic
implication remains to be determined. Clinical trials
evaluating this strategy will be soon recruiting patients
(NCT02673333, NCT02720484 and NCT02720484).
[132-134]
Another potential target is interleukin-13 receptor
α2 (IL-13Rα2), which is a high-affinity receptor for
the Th2-derived cytokine interleukin-13 (IL- 13).[135]
IL-13Rα2 is significantly overexpressed in ACCs as
compared to normal adrenocortical tissues and benign
adrenocortical tumors.[136] IL-13-PE is a chimeric fusion
protein consisting of human IL-13 and a truncated form of
Pseudomonas exotoxin A.[136] A phase I trial of IL-13www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PE in ACC expressing IL-13Rα2 showed stable disease
among 3/6 patients lasting for 2-5.5 months[137] IL-13PE at dose of 1-2 lg/kg was administered intravenously
(IV) on day 1, 3, and 5 in a 4-week cycle. Dose-limiting
toxicities were observed at 2 lg/kg, at which patients
exhibited thrombocytopenia and renal insufficiency
without requiring dialysis. A possible limitation is that
neutralizing antibodies developed in 67% of the patients
in high titers.

DISCUSSION
As of today, chemotherapy remains the standard
of care treatment for the treatment of locally advanced
or metastatic ACC. The FIRM-ACT indicated that
combination of mitotane with etoposide, doxorubicin
and cisplatin (EDPM) promotes PFS prolongation in
patients with metastatic ACC compared to treatment with
mitotane plus streptozocin.[36] Nonetheless, EDPM is
associated with serious adverse events in greater than 50%
of patients including myelosuppression, cardiovascular
or thromboembolic events, infection, neurotoxicity and
general health deterioration. For patients with good
performance status, EPDM seems to be a reasonable
option, whereas mitotane combined with streptozocin
could be offered to patients with poorer performance
status.[17]
As reviewed above, many early phase studies
have been conducted in ACC in the past years, but no

breakthrough targeted therapy trial has been reported
thus far (Figure 2). IGFR, while a promising target given
the high IGFR/mTOR pathway activation in ACC, failed
as predictive marker of benefit with anti IGFR therapy.
[40] The phase III trial of linsitinib versus placebo in
ACC was closed due to the lack of demonstration of
overall survival benefit at interim analysis.[48] The
simultaneous targeting of the IGFR and mTOR showed
more promising results in one phase I trial with 11 out of
26 patients experiencing stable disease after 6 months of
therapy, suggesting potential efficacy from combinatory
strategies.[55] Agents targeting the VEGFRs and other
tyrosine kinase receptors such as cKIT, EGFR and FGFR
have not shown significant antitumor activity. [63, 65, 67,
68, 72, 78, 83] While interesting pre-clinical data of other
potential targets for ACC (e.g., steroidogenic factor 1,
c-Met pathway, estrogen receptors, DNA methylation) are
emerging, an expansion of immunotherapy translational
studies would also be desirable.[92, 106, 109, 116, 131]
Importantly, several studies have explored the

genomic landscape of this rare malignancy using next
generation sequencing approaches.[11, 79, 138-145]
These studies highlight not only the significant tumor
heterogeneity inherent to ACC, but they were also able
to define groups of different prognosis based on the
mutational profiles.[11, 140] In the study by Ross et
al, clinical specimens from 29 patients with metastatic
or locally advanced adrenocortical carcinoma were
sequenced.[138] In 17 (59%) of ACC, at least one genomic
alteration was associated with an available therapeutic
or a mechanism-based clinical trial. Poli et al reported a
different proteomic profile in adrenocortical carcinoma
compared with normal adrenal cortex characterized by
overexpression of mainly metabolic enzymes that can be
a potential target for novel therapeutics.[146]
These studies have identified recurring mutations
in several genes such as ZNRF3 (20%), CTNNB1 (14%),
TP53 (14%), CDKN2A (11%), RB1 (5%), MEN (16%),
DAXX (5%), MED12 (3%) and TERT (5%).[11] Despite
the identification of common genetic abnormalities, the

development of targeted therapies for this disease has been
thwarted by the rarity of ACC as illustrated by the small
sample sizes ranging from 8 to 132 tumor samples in these
studies characterizing the genomic alterations. In addition,
the construction of valid prognostic and predictive
multivariable models incorporating clinicopathological
and genomic characteristics are also hampered by the
scarcity of the ACC tumor tissue. Comprehensive genomic
profiling of ACC tumor samples is underway through The
Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) and final results
are expected in the near future that will certainly add
important information to guide future drug development.
[147]
Another corollary to the low incidence of ACC is
the challenge of conducting prospective biomarker-based
clinical trials. As in some instances, ACC represents
an underrepresented population of phase I or phase II
basket trials (Table 1). Conversely, collaborations have
been fostered already such as the European Network for
the Study of Adrenal tumors (ENSAT-CANCER) which
offers a virtual research environment with a digitally
interconnected infrastructure for distributed clinicians
specializing in rare adrenal tumors to communicate
and collaborate with distributed biomedical research
communities.[148] Indeed large studies such as the FIRM
ACT trial epitomize the successful endeavor of ACC
treatment development insofar it enrolled 304 patients
with ACC from 12 different countries.
Other international collaborations exist in order
to increase the clinicopathological datasets, tissue
banking, that ultimately will enable biomarker-based
clinical studies. For example, the German Adrenocortical
Carcinoma Registry is among those projects in which data
will be collected for future consideration of prospective
studies and facilitate accrual of patients (NCT00453674).
[149] Similarly, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has
initiated both prospective clinical data collection, as
well as tissue sample and blood sample acquisition of
patients with ACC to further develop the understanding
of this malignancy (NCT02015026).[150] Furthermore
combination of already available and new targeted
therapies is likely to optimize tumor response to treatments
in development and ultimately prolong survival in patients
with ACC.[151]
