Abstract
Artesunate is a semisynthetic derivative from artemisinin, a
natural product from the Chinese herb Artemisia annua L. It
exerts antimalarial activity, and, additionally, artemisinin and
its derivatives are active against cancer cells. The active
moiety is an endoperoxide bridge. Its cleavage leads to the
formation of reactive oxygen species and carbon-centered
radicals. These highly reactive molecules target several
proteins in Plasmodia, which is thought to result in killing
of the microorganism. DNA damage induced by artemisinins
has not yet been described. Here, we show that artesunate
induces apoptosis and necrosis. It also induces DNA breakage
in a dose-dependent manner as shown by single-cell gel
electrophoresis. This genotoxic effect was confirmed by
measuring the level of ;-H2AX, which is considered to be an
indication of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Polymerase
B–deficient cells were more sensitive than the wild-type to
artesunate, indicating that the drug induces DNA damage that
is repaired by base excision repair. irs1 and VC8 cells defective
in homologous recombination (HR) due to inactivation of
XRCC2 and BRCA2, respectively, were more sensitive to
artesunate than the corresponding wild-type. This was also
true for XR-V15B cells defective in nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ) due to inactivation of Ku80. The data indicate
that DSBs induced by artesunate are repaired by the HR and
NHEJ pathways. They suggest that DNA damage induced by
artesunate contributes to its therapeutic effect against cancer
cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(11):4347–51]

Introduction
Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene isolated from Artemisia annua L.,
which is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of
fever and chills (1). Artemisinin has profound activity against
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax (2). Artesunate and
artemether are semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin. In addition
to their antimalarial activity, artemisinin and its derivatives are also
active against cancer cells (3–7).
The active moiety of artemisinins is an endoperoxide bridge. In
Plasmodia, the cleavage of the endoperoxide moiety is facilitated
by heme iron released during hemoglobin digestion of Plasmodia in
erythrocytes of the host. In a Fe(II) Fenton reaction, reactive

oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions,
are generated (8). Furthermore, carbon-centered radical species are
generated by decomposition of artemisinins (9). These highly
reactive molecules alkylate heme and several other proteins, such
as translationally controlled tumor protein, histidine-rich protein
(42 kDa), and pfATP6, the sarco/endoplasmatic reticulum calcium
ATPase (10, 11). Recent observations indicate that oxidative stress
also plays a role in the activity of artemisinins against cancer cells
(12, 13). Whereas protein alkylation by artemisinin and its
derivatives has been well established, damage of DNA has not yet
been reported in Plasmodia (14).
In this study, we have readdressed the question of whether
artesunate induces DNA damage. The rationale for this study was
the findings that (a) concentrations required for inhibiting cancer
cells are about 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for
killing Plasmodia and (b) radicals derived from artesunate are
expected to attack various types of molecules, including DNA. To
prove this, we first measured DNA damage by the comet assay and
g-H2AX phosphorylation. To see which mode of DNA repair is
important for artesunate-induced DNA damage, we then investigated cell lines with defined molecular defects in the main DNA
repair pathways [e.g., nucleotide excision repair (NER), base
excision repair (BER), nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and damage reversal by O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)].

Materials and Methods
Materials and cell lines. Antibodies used for Western blotting were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and Upstate. For the
experiments, we used the following cell lines. (a) Chinese hamster ovary cell
line CHO-9 and the NER-deficient derivatives 27-1 and 43-3B (15). The 27-1
cells are mutated in ERCC3, whereas 43-3B cells are mutated in ERCC1. The
cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 containing Glutamax (Life Technologies)
and 5% heat-inactivated FCS. (b) The parental hamster lung fibroblast cell
line V79-2 and their HR-deficient derivatives VC8, VC8 MGMT, and VC8
mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (mBAC). The VC8 cells are defective
in the BRCA2 gene. VC8 MGMT cells are transfected with the MGMT gene
and express MGMT at high level (data not shown). VC8 mBAC was
generated by chromosomal complementation of VC8. (c) The parental
Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line V79wt and its HR-deficient
derivative irs1. The irs1 cells are defective in the XRCC2 gene (supplied by
Dr. Margaret Zdienicka). (d) The parental Chinese hamster lung fibroblast
cell line V79-B and the NHEJ-deficient derivative XR-V15B, which is
defective in the Ku80 gene. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 and
10% heat-inactivated FCS. (e) The parental mouse fibroblast cell line
polymerase h+/+ (Polh+/+) and the BER-defective derivative Polh / , which
is defective in Polh (kindly provided by R. Sobol, Hillman Cancer Center,
Pittsburgh, PA; ref. 16). These cell lines were cultured in DMEM/highglucose medium and 10% heat-inactivated FCS.
Artesunate treatment. For the survival assays, the cells were treated
with artesunate continuously after 6 h of seeding. For Western blot

artesunate.
Clonogenic survival experiments. Cells (up to 500 per plate) were
seeded into 6-cm dishes. After 6 h, they were treated with concentrations of
artesunate ranging between 1 and 5 Ag/mL (if not otherwise stated
continuously). Artesunate was dissolved in DMSO and then diluted (1:1) in
H2O to a final stock solution of 2 mg/mL. One week later, colonies were

violet for counting. Cell survival was expressed in relation to the untreated
control. Values are given as mean of three independent experiments.
Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Single-strand breaks
were determined and quantified by the highly sensitive neutral single-cell
gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) as previously described (17). In brief,
cells were embedded in 0.5% low melting point agarose, and microscope
slides were immersed in ice-cold lysis solution [2.5 mol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L
EDTA, 10 mmol/L Tris, 1% sodium laurylsarcosine (pH 7), 1% Triton X-100,
and 10% DMSO were added freshly] and maintained at 4jC for 1 h. After
lysis, electrophoresis (25 V) was performed at 4jC for 15 min in 90 mmol/L
Tris, 90 mmol/L boric acid, and 2 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.5). The fixed and
ethidium bromide–stained slides were analyzed using a fluorescence
microscope. The analysis of DNA migration was performed by an image
analysis system (Kinetic Imaging Ltd.; Komet 4.0.2; Optilas), determining the
median tail moment (percentage of DNA in the tail/tail length) of 50 cells
per sample.
Quantification of apoptosis. For determination of apoptotic and
necrotic cells, flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V/FITC–stained and
propidium iodide–stained cells was performed as described. Cells were
trypsinized, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 30 AL cold Annexin V
binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.14 mol/L NaCl, 0.25 mmol/L
CaCl22 H2O, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; w/v)]. After addition of
1.5 AL Annexin/FITC (Becton Dickinson), cells were incubated in the dark
for 15 to 30 min. At least 264 AL binding buffer and 6 AL propidium iodide
(50 Ag/mL) were added per sample. Samples were analyzed using a FACSort
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Values are given as mean of three
independent experiments.
For determination of apoptotic cells, cells were trypsinized, washed in
PBS, and resuspended in 100 AL cold PBS. Afterwards, 2 mL of ice-cold
70% ethanol were added per sample and the samples were kept at
20jC for at least 15 min and up to 5 d. Following centrifugation, cells
were resuspended in 333 AL PBS containing RNase (0.03 Ag/mL) and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Afterwards, 164 AL
propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) was added to the samples. Samples were
analyzed using a FACSort flow cytometer. Values are given as mean of
three independent experiments.
Preparation of protein extracts. Cells were harvested by trypsinization,
washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in whole-cell extract buffer
[1 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris, 1 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol, 5%
glycine (pH 8.5), 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride].
Then, cells were disrupted (2  10 pulse, 40 duty cycles) on ice using the
Branson Sonifier Cell Disruptor B15. To remove cell debris, the suspension
was centrifuged (10,000  g for 15 min). The supernatants were collected
and the protein concentration was determined.
Western blot analysis. Protein (30 Ag per sample) was separated in a
10% to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis. Thereafter, proteins
were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher and
Schuell) overnight. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) milk
powder in TBS [10 TBS: 24.2 g Tris, 80 g NaCl (pH 7.6), in 1 L H2O]
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS), incubated overnight with the primary
antibody (1:1,000–1:3,000 dilution), washed thrice for 10 min with T-TBS,
and incubated for 2 h with anti-mouse, anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:4,000). After the final washing with T-TBS (10 min for three times), blots
were developed by using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham).
;-H2AX immunofluorescence staining. Coverslips were cleaned for
10 min with diethylether and washed with 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and
H2Odest for 20 min in 1 mol/L HCl; afterwards, the coverslips were kept in
70% ethanol. Cells (105) were seeded on clean coverslips in a 6-cm dish.
The cells were treated 24 h after seeding with different doses of artesunate.
Twenty-four hours after treatment, the cells on the coverslips were washed
with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After crosslinking, the cells on the coverslips were washed thrice for 5 min with PBS.
Ice-cold methanol (100%) was added to the paraformaldehyde cross-linked
cells on the coverslips and kept at 20jC for 20 min. Thereafter, the
coverslips were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h.

alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis. Points, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. B, CHO-9 cells were exposed to artesunate (ART ) for 24 h,
harvested, and subjected to Western blot analysis. As loading control, the filter was reincubated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (Erk2 ). Induction factors (IF )
were calculated by densitometric measurements of g-H2AX and related to Erk2. C, immunohistochemical staining of cells not treated (Control ) and treated with
artesunate for 24 h. Nuclei were stained red with propidium iodide; g-H2AX foci are the green fluorescent dots on the red background. D, quantification of g-H2AX foci

The blocking medium was removed and 50 AL of primary antibody g-H2AX
(1:1,000 in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100) were added directly onto the coverslips
and kept at 4jC overnight. The next day, the coverslips were washed twice
for 5 min with PBS and once for 2 min with high-salt PBS (PBS + 0.4 mol/L
NaCl). Afterwards, 50 AL of the secondary antibody (anti-g-H2AX Alexa Fluor
488, 1:500 in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100) were added onto the coverslips and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Then, the coverslips were
again washed (in the dark) twice for 5 min with PBS and once with high-salt
PBS. Antifade medium [10 AL; glycerol/PBS (1:1), 2.5% DABCO (pH 8.6),
1 Amol/L propidium iodide, 100 Ag/mL RNase] was added on slides and the
coverslips were put on the slides. Then, the coverslips were sealed with nail

varnish to prevent drying and kept in the dark at 4jC. The slides were
analyzed with a fluorescence microscope.

Results
First, we studied the effect of artesunate on cell survival. As
shown in Fig. 1A, artesunate is clearly more cytotoxic if treatment
occurs permanently compared with 24 h. Measurement of
apoptosis by sub-G1 flow cytometry revealed that artesunate
induces apoptosis dose and time dependently (Fig. 1B). It was also
able to induce necrosis, which is even higher than the level of

apoptosis, as determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide flow
cytometry (Fig. 1C).
The genotoxic potential of artesunate was determined by
alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2, the
drug induces significant DNA breakage that increases with dose.
This genotoxic effect was verified by measuring the level of
g-H2AX, which is considered to be related to DNA double-strand
break (DSB) formation. The overall g-H2AX level increased in the
same dose range in which cells responded in the comet assay
(Fig. 3A). This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on cellular
level, which revealed that already after treatment with 5 Ag/mL
artesunate significant g-H2AX foci were induced (Fig. 3B). The data
show that artesunate is able to induce DNA damage that either
represent DSBs or will be converted into DSBs.
If artesunate is able to induce DNA damage, it is anticipated that
DNA repair-defective cells are more sensitive than the corresponding wild-type cells to artesunate. To prove this hypothesis,
we determined the cytotoxic response of different well-described
repair-deficient cell lines toward artesunate. As shown in Fig. 3A,
43-3B and 27-1 cells defective in NER are not clearly more sensitive
to artesunate, indicating that the drug does not induce bulky DNA
lesions. Interestingly, Polh-deficient cells were highly sensitive to
artesunate (Fig. 3B). Polh is a key enzyme in BER, indicating that
artesunate-induced DNA damage is repaired by the BER pathway.
DNA base damage can be converted into DSBs that are repaired
by NHEJ and HR. Therefore, we studied the effect of artesunate on
mutants defective in the repair of DSBs. irs1 cells defective in HR
were more sensitive to artesunate than the wild-type (Fig. 4A). Even
more dramatic was the response of VC8 cells (Fig. 4B), defective in
HR due to mutational inactivation of BRCA2. Complementation of
VC8 cells generating the clone VC8 mBAC (18) partially rescued the
artesunate hypersensitive phenotype (Fig. 4B), which is to be
expected if the hypersensitivity to artesunate is due to the HR
repair defect. Transfection with MGMT did not result in significant
increase in survival of VC8 cells, indicating that DNA methylation
damage is very likely not involved in artesunate-induced cell death.
Similar to the previous lines, V15B cells defective in Ku80 were also
more sensitive to artesunate. Ku80 is involved in NHEJ, indicating
that this DSB repair pathway may also play a role in repairing
artesunate-induced DNA damage.

that cells defective in DSB repair are more sensitive to artesunate.
This was indeed the case. Cells displaying a defect in the HR
pathway due to mutational inactivation of XRCC2 or BRCA2
proved to be hypersensitive toward artesunate. Cells exhibiting a
defect in NHEJ due to inactivation of Ku80 were also more
sensitive. This suggests that both HR and NHEJ play a role in the
repair of DSBs that arose from exposure to artesunate. Because
HR is the major pathway of DSB repair in the S phase, it is

Discussion
In this investigation, we show that artesunate is able to induce
DNA damage and apoptosis. DNA damage was quantified by the
alkaline comet assay that determines DNA single-strand breaks. We
further found that cells defective in NER were not more sensitive to
artesunate, which suggests that artesunate does not induce bulky
DNA lesions that are subject to repair by NER. However, cells
defective in Polh, which is a key enzyme in BER (16), were clearly
more sensitive than the corresponding wild-type to artesunate.
This implies that artesunate causes DNA damage that is repaired
by BER. Given the role of artesunate in the oxidative stress
response in Plasmodia, it is pertinent to conclude that artesunate
induces oxidative DNA damage in mammalian cells, which directly
or indirectly (i.e., replication mediated) results in the formation of
DNA breaks.
We further showed that artesunate induces the formation of
DSBs, as determined by g-H2AX phosphorylation, which occurred
24 to 48 h after treatment with a dose of >5 Ag/mL and proceeded
cell death by apoptosis. If DSBs are induced, it would be expected

pertinent to conclude that at least a part of the DSBs observed
arose from interference of artesunate-induced DNA lesions with
the DNA replication machinery.
Overall, the data support the role of oxidative DNA damage and
DSBs as the underlying reason for the anticancer effect of
artesunate, which is mediated by the induction of apoptosis. We
should note that, in the course of investigations on the use of
artemisinin and artesunate to treat malaria, artemisinin has been
found to bind to certain target proteins, but not to DNA (14). This
may be due to the fact that artemisinin and its derivatives are
active toward Plasmodia at much lower concentrations than the
concentrations required for causing DNA damage. It may also
indicate that DNA damage is not caused by direct binding of
artesunate to DNA but because of induction of oxidative stress.
This may occur at higher dose level in mammalian cells than in
Plasmodia, which may explain the low systemic side effects in
malaria therapy.
Similarly, the tumor specificity of artesunate might be explained
based on high-level induction of oxidative DNA damage in tumor
cells compared with normal cells. Alternatively, it is pertinent to
speculate that tumor cells are less efficient in repairing artesunateinduced DNA damages, notably DSBs, and/or execute better
apoptosis. Nevertheless, is has to be considered that the
genotoxicity of artesunate may lead to adverse side effects in
some normal tissues. Although artesunate does not reveal severe
side effects during malaria therapy (19), experiments in animals
revealed neurotoxicity at supratherapeutic doses (20). As higher
concentrations of artesunate are required to kill cancer cells,
compared with the treatment of malaria, it has to be taken into

account that artesunate might be neurotoxic in cancer treatment.
In line with this view are data showing that artemisinin produces
reactive oxygen species that inhibit brain stem cell cultures (21).
The authors found that mRNA expression levels of manganesedependent superoxide dismutase decreased on artemisinin treatment due to mitochondrial dysfunction. In our analyses, we treated
cells transfected with cDNAs for heavy and light chains of
g-glutamylcysteine synthetase (g-GCS) with artesunate. Because
g-GCS is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of the
detoxifying molecule glutathione, it is expected that transfected
cells are resistant to artesunate. Indeed, we found a 2.5-fold
increase of resistance of transfected cells compared with mock
controls (22). Moreover, we used L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO),
which is a specific inhibitor of glutathione, thus depleting
glutathione pools. BSO sensitized g-GCS–transfected cells for
artesunate to a level comparable with mock vector–transfected
cells (22). BSO also increased neurotoxic effects of nontoxic
concentrations of other artemisinin derivatives, artemether and
dihydroartemisinin, suggesting that endogenous glutathione participates in the prevention of neurotoxicity of artemisinins (23).
All of these findings are consistent with a role of artesunate in
mediating DNA damage by oxidative stress.
