ABSTRACT
It remains a challenge in oncology to identify novel drug regimens to efficiently
tackle glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Here, we target
deubiquitinases for glioblastoma therapy by utilizing the small-molecule inhibitor
WP1130 which has been characterized as a deubiquitinase inhibitor that interferes
with the function of Usp9X. Expression analysis data confirm that Usp9X expression
is increased in glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissue indicating its potential
as a therapeutic. Consistently, increasing concentrations of WP1130 decrease the
cellular viability of established, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and stem cell-like
glioblastoma cells. Specific down-regulation of Usp9X reduces viability in glioblastoma
cells mimicking the effects of WP1130. Mechanistically, WP1130 elicits apoptosis
and increases activation of caspases. Moreover, WP1130 and siRNAs targeting
Usp9X reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and Inhibitor
of Apoptosis Proteins, XIAP and Survivin. Pharmacological and genetic interference
with Usp9X efficiently sensitized glioblastoma cells to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
stimuli. In addition, single treatment with WP1130 elicited anti-glioma activity in
an orthotopic proneural murine model of glioblastoma. Finally, the combination
treatment of WP1130 and ABT263 inhibited tumor growth more efficiently than each
reagent by its own in vivo without detectable side effects or organ toxicity. Taken
together, these results suggest that targeting deubiquitinases for glioma therapy is
feasible and effective.

INTRODUCTION

pathways are dysregulated even at the single-cell level
which underlines the necessity for the combination of
different targeted agents in a multi-targeting approach [2].
Malignant transformation and maintenance
of the neoplastic cellular phenotype are the result of
dysregulation of a complex molecular interplay. Within
this molecular framework, post-translational modification
such as ubiquitination/deubiquitination represents a major
determinant for protein stability, trafficking or function
and is therefore conceived to be key to confer the balance
between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling [3]. Once this
complex system is dysregulated cells are potentially guided

Glioblastoma is among the most difficult to treat
human malignancies and consequently patients diagnosed
with a glioblastoma succumb to this disease within 2 years
in the vast majority of cases [1]. The lack of therapeutic
progress stands in sharp contrast to a fast-paced increase
in knowledge about the molecular nature of this disease.
Among the many factors that are responsible for the
recalcitrant behavior of these neoplasms is the heterogeneity
of gliomas which remains to be one of the most challenging
features to target. Within a single glioblastoma tumor many

Down-regulation of Usp9X inhibits proliferation
in glioblastoma cell lines

towards a neoplastic phenotype and the formation of cancer.
As a consequence, small molecule inhibitors such as the
deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130 were designed to allow
for a restoration of cellular homeostasis as potential anticancer agents.
The deubiquitinating enzyme Usp9X was shown
to be overexpressed in various human cancers, including
glioblastoma (Supplementary Figure S1), which supports
the notion that deubiquitinating enzymes represent a valid
target in this disease and that their inhibition may add to a
concerted strategy against glioblastoma [4]. Consequently,
we show in this study that interference with deubiquitinases,
such as Usp9X, results in a marked anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effect on established, glioma stem-like and
primary patient-derived xenograft glioblastoma cells.
Morever, this effect can be synergistically enhanced when
combined with the BH3-mimetic ABT263 or the death
receptor ligand Tumor necrosis factor α-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL). More importantly, we show
that local intracranial administration of the deubiquitinase
inhibitor WP1130 using convection-enhanced delivery
results in a prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when
combining WP1130 with ABT263 tumor growth is
significantly attenuated compared to single-agent treatment
or control in vivo.

In order to further examine whether the antiproliferative effect on glioblastoma cells following a
treatment with WP1130 can be recapitulated by specific
knock-down of Usp9X we performed siRNA experiments.
As shown in Figure 1E–1G, treatment with Usp9X-siRNA
resulted in significantly reduced cell viability. Specific
knock-down was confirmed via Western blot analysis
(Figures 3B and 4F).

Treatment with the deubiquitinase inhibitor
WP1130 induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells
Next, we assessed if apoptosis may be responsible for
the antiproliferative effect of deubiquitinase inhibition we
observed. Therefore, we treated established glioblastoma
cell lines and patient-derived GBM12 glioblastoma cells
with WP1130 and determined the fluorescent intensity of
annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). In all glioblastoma
cells we tested the fraction of annexin V-positive and PInegative cells (early apoptotic cells) and/or the fraction
of annexin V- and PI-positive cells (late apoptotic cells)
was significantly increased when treated with WP1130
(Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure S3B). In concordance
with these data, Western blot analyses showed that cleavage
of caspases 9 and 3 was also markedly enhanced following
treatment of U87MG (B), T98G (C), U251 (D) and SF188
(E) glioblastoma cells with increasing concentrations of
WP1130 (Figure 2B–2E).

RESULTS
The deubiquitinase Usp9X is highly expressed in
glioblastoma
In silico analysis revealed that DNA copy number or
mRNA expression of Usp9X is significantly increased in
glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma when compared to
normal brain (Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, when
analyzing the Rembrandt database, patients carrying less
than 1.8 copies of the Usp9X gene seemed to have a better
prognosis with respect to overall survival (Supplementary
Figure S2).

Specific knock-down of Usp9X induces apoptosis
in glioblastoma cells
We next examined whether specific knock-down
of Usp9X recapitulates the pro-apoptotic effect caused
by treatment with WP1130. Therefore, we performed
siRNA experiments down-regulating protein expression of
Usp9X in GBM12 patient-derived glioblastoma cells and
SF188 pediatric glioblastoma cells. As shown in Figure 2F
and 2G, the fraction of apoptotic cells was significantly
increased in both cell lines. On the molecular level,
cleavage of caspases 9 and 3 was significantly increased
when Usp9X was down-regulated (Figure 2H).

Treatment with the deubiquitinase inhibitor
WP1130 inhibits proliferation of established
glioblastoma and glioma stem-like cells
To assess whether inhibition of deubiquitinases affects
proliferation of glioblastoma cells in vitro we treated SF188
(pediatric), MGPP-3 (proneural, transgenic), T98G and
U251 glioblastoma cells as well as NCH644 and NCH421K
glioma stem-like cells with increasing concentrations of
the deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130 (Figure 1A and 1B)
prior to performing MTT assays. As shown in Figure 1C,
treatment with WP1130 yielded an anti-proliferative effect
across all cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner.
Notably, treatment with WP1130 resulted in marked
anti-proliferative activity and morphological changes in
NCH644 and NCH421K glioma stem-like cells (Figure 1C
and 1D, Supplementary Figure S3A).

Inhibition of deubiquitinases decreases the
expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members and the Mcl-1 chaperone, Bag3
Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are important
regulators of apoptosis and known to confer resistance to
anti-cancer treatments. The deubiquitinase Usp9X and the
chaperone Bag3 stabilize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
member Mcl-1. Since WP1130 inhibits Usp9X we further
assessed the effects of WP1130 treatment on Mcl-1 as well
as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expression. As anticipated,

Down-regulation of Mcl-1 and Usp9X occurs
through a post-transcriptional mechanism

treatment with WP1130 lead to down-regulation of Usp9X
in a dose-dependent manner in SF188, U251 and T98G
glioblastoma cells (Figure 3A). In addition, expression of
Bag3 was also markedly reduced. Consistent with these
findings, Mcl-1 expression was decreased in all studied
cell lines. Moreover, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression was
also significantly decreased upon treatment with WP1130
in a dose-dependent manner. These molecular alterations
following a treatment with WP1130 were mirrored
when silencing Usp9X with siRNA in SF188 pediatric
glioblastoma cells (Figure 3B).

To assess whether the WP1130-mediated downregulation of Mcl-1 and Usp9X is due to a transcriptional
mechanism we performed real-time PCR analyses in U251
glioblastoma cells following treatment with WP1130. As
shown in Supplementary Figure S4, treatment with WP1130
resulted in a dose-dependent and probably compensatory
increase of Mcl-1 mRNA levels after 6 h and only a minor
decrease after 24 h. Similar findings were observed for

of WP1130. We found that WP1130 suppressed the
levels of XIAP and Survivin in SF188 and U251 cells
further enhancing the effects of WP1130 on apoptosis
(Figure 3A). These findings were recapitulated in SF188
cells silenced for Usp9X (Figure 3B). To assess whether
WP1130-mediated down-regulation of Survivin is due to
caspase-cleavage, U251 glioblastoma cells were treated
with WP1130 in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase
inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Figure 3C). Caspase inhibition
resulted as anticipated in a partial, relatively minor rescue of
Survivin protein expression. Since zVAD-fmk only partially
restored Survivin levels, we examined to which extent

Interference with deubiquitinases suppresses the
levels of the anti-apoptotic inhibitor of apoptosis

Because IAPs are important regulators of apoptosis
at the level of effector caspases, we determined the levels
of the two most prominent members out of this family,
Survivin and XIAP, in response to increasing concentrations

Local delivery of WP1130 extends survival
in vivo

inhibition of proteasomal degradation would counteract the
loss in Survivin. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor
MG-132 yielded a stronger restoration of Survivin levels
when compared to inhibition of caspases alone. This finding
was even more pronounced when cells were treated with
WP1130 in the presence of both zVAD-fmk and MG-132.
Overall, these findings suggest that the decrease in Survivin
is at least in part mediated by caspase-cleavage, but still
mainly through enhanced proteasomal degradation.

Next, we examined whether inhibition of
deubiquitinases exerts anti-cancer activity in a murine
orthotopic glioblastoma model. WP1130 or vehicle was
administered locally by convection-enhanced delivery.
In order to verify correct drug delivery, Gadolinium was
added to the solvent in the micro-osmotic pumps and
intraparenchymal Gadolinium signal was detected by MRI
(Figure 5A). Animals receiving a continuous treatment
for 7 days with WP1130 showed a marked prolongation
of survival when compared to animals receiving vehicle
(Figure 5B). Notably, two WP1130-treated animals were
still alive 6 months after tumor cell injection.

Inhibition of deubiquitinases sensitizes for the
BH3-mimetic ABT263
Expression of Mcl-1 represents one of the most
important mechanisms of resistance towards the BH3mimetic ABT263. Since treatment with WP1130 results in a
marked down-regulation of Mcl-1 we hypothesized that this
finding should lead to an enhanced anti-neoplastic activity
of ABT263 in a combinatorial treatment approach. We
therefore treated U251, GBM12 and LN229 glioblastoma
cells with WP1130, ABT263 or the combination prior to
assessing anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic activity. In all
cell lines tested, we found a synergistic anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic effect of the combination treatment
(Figure 3D–3I) and (Table 1). Moreover, this observation
was recapitulated by specific knock-down of either Mcl-1
(Figure 3J and Figure 4F) or Usp9X (Figure 3K and
Figure 4F) when comparing knock-down plus ABT263
treatment to knock-down or ABT263 treatment alone.

Combined inhibition of deubiquitinases and
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL attenuates tumor growth in vivo
We showed that a combined treatment with the
deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130 and the BH3-mimetic
ABT263 resulted in a synergistic anti-neoplastic activity
in vitro. Therefore, we next addressed the question whether
this therapeutic strategy would also prove to be of benefit
in vivo. In a heterotopic U251 glioblastoma model,
combined treatment with WP1130 and ABT263 resulted in
a significant attenuation in tumor growth when compared to
single-agent treatment or control (Figure 5C–5E). Moreover,
the combination treatment led to a 47.7% regression of
tumor size suggesting that this treatment not only attenuated
tumor growth but induced tumor cell death. Consistently,
histological analysis revealed a significantly reduced cellular
density in tumor tissue (Figure 5F). Importantly, any signs
for a potential organ toxicity of this therapeutic regimen
were absent (Figure 5G).

Interference with deubiquitinases sensitizes for
extrinsic apoptosis
To further address the question whether inhibition
of deubiquitinases may also enhance inducers of
extrinsic apoptosis we treated glioblastoma cells with
TRAIL, WP1130 or the combination of both. As shown
in Figure 4A–4C, combined treatment with TRAIL and
WP1130 resulted in a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect on
glioblastoma cells. In concordance with these findings, on
the molecular level, the combination treatment resulted in
enhanced cleavage of caspases 8, 9 and 3 as well as PARP
in U251 and LN229 glioblastoma cells (Figure 4D and 4E).

DISCUSSION
Deubiquitinases are up-regulated and are pivotal
enzymes within cancer cells since they participate in
maintaining high levels of molecules that ultimately drive
the relentless growth of tumor cells. Certain deubiquitinases
have received particular attention as treatment targets.
Among these enzymes is the deubiquitinase Usp9X, which
has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in various
malignant tumors, including breast cancer, lung carcinoma,
prostatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma, multiple myeloma,
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and follicular and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma [5–9].
In glioblastoma, only little is known about the role
of Usp9X and other deubiquitinases. In our report, we
confirm earlier observations made in other tumor entities
showing that Usp9X levels are up-regulated in tumor
tissue but not normal tissue. Thus, it appears that targeting
Usp9X might have impact on glioma growth and could
be preferentially targeted over normal non-neoplastic
tissue. Another recent report supports the relevance of

Knock-down of Mcl-1 or Usp9X sensitizes for
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
We showed that interference with deubiquitinases by
treatment with WP1130 down-regulates Usp9X and Mcl-1.
To assess whether down-regulation of Usp9X or Mcl-1 is
sufficient to recapitulate the sensitizing effect of WP1130
for TRAIL-mediated apoptosis U251 glioblastoma cells
were transfected with Mcl-1- or Usp9X-siRNA (Figure
4F). Both, knock-down for Mcl-1 (Figure 4G and 4I) and
Usp9X (Figure 4H and 4J) resulted in a significant increase
in the fraction of apoptotic cells when combined with
TRAIL.

Usp9X in brain tumors [10]. Cox et al. demonstrated
that Usp9X is one of the proteins that interacts with
the transcription factor SOX2, a marker of human stem
cells. They also provided early evidence that interference
with Usp9X impairs the growth of established human
glioblastoma cells in vitro [10]. Our present study extends
these findings and provides significant additional insight
on the role of Usp9X in glioblastoma biology. We show
that the Usp9X inhibitor, WP1130, exerts anti-glioma
activity in established, stem cell-like glioma, proneural
and patient-derived glioblastoma xenograft cells. Notably,
WP1130 is not inhibiting only Usp9X, but also other
deubiquitinases such as Usp14 and Usp5 [11]. However,
siRNA mediated knock-down of Usp9X in glioblastoma
cells recapitulates the effects of WP1130, suggesting that
WP1130 significantly mediates its anti-glioma effects
by interference with Usp9X function. Our results are
in agreement with earlier reports in other tumor types
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[6, 9, 12–15]. Conflicting results have been reported on
the role of Usp9X in pancreatic cancer. Initially, it was
claimed that Usp9X interferes with cell death of normal
pancreatic cells in a cell death process that was referred
to as “zymophagy” [16]. Contrasting these results, it
was shown that in conditional knock-out mice the loss
of Usp9X paradoxically entertained tumor growth in
the presence of mutated Kras (G12D) [17]. Therefore,
Usp9X was claimed to exert tumor-suppressive functions
[17]. However, in the context of established pancreatic
cancer cell line model systems Usp9X appears to have
pro-survival functions [12], which is also in line with our
findings in various glioblastoma models. Suppression
of Usp9X levels reduced the growth of several different
pancreatic cancer cell lines, including BxPC3 and others,
and consistent with that observation altered the cell cycle
profile of these cells [12]. Similarly to the knock-down
of Usp9X, the deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130 exerted

anti-proliferative effects on pancreatic cancer cells.
Although these observations appear to contradict the
results of the earlier studies in transgenic mice, it needs
to be acknowledged that the studies in cell lines were
conducted in vitro and the effects have not been validated
in proper in vivo model systems.

Mechanistically, the genetic and pharmacological
interference with Usp9X leads to a strong activation of
apoptosis with initiator- and effector caspase activation
in different types of glioblastoma model systems. The
involvement of apoptotic cell death is in agreement with
other recent studies that have shown that Usp9X loss-of

function activates or enhances apoptosis [4, 7, 9, 18–21].
For instance, in the setting of B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (B-ALL) interference with Usp9X caused baxdependent apoptosis and suppression of the pro-survival
mTORC1 signaling pathway [9]. With respect to other forms
of cell death, a recent study demonstrated that WP1130
inhibited autophagy through inhibition of ULK1, which
may suggest that Usp9X inhibition blocks cytoprotective
autophagy in order to enhance apoptosis [22].
Given the engagement of apoptotic cell death upon
treatment with WP1130, we hypothesized that the intrinsic
apoptotic signaling cascade is regulated by loss of Usp9X
function. In line with this notion, increasing concentrations
of WP1130 depleted the levels of certain reported Usp9X
targets, such as Mcl-1 [7, 8] and the inhibitor of apoptosis
protein, Survivin [23]. However, other anti-apoptotic
molecules, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP, were downregulated as well, while the pro-apoptotic Noxa was
increased. However, it is important to bear in mind that due
to overlapping effects of caspase activation, one cannot
assume that all findings made after WP1130 treatment are
a consequence of Usp9X inhibition. So far, the increase
of pro-apoptotic Noxa has not been described in the
context of Usp9X inhibition and this will likely further
enhance susceptibility to intrinsic apoptosis. Overall, these
observations reinforce the notion that interference with
the Usp9X signaling axis confers a pro-apoptotic state in
various glioblastoma cell culture models. These findings
are in line with previous reports [10, 18, 19].
Since we observed a significant modulation of
Mcl- 1 and Noxa expression, we tested the hypothesis that
interference with Usp9X signaling renders cells sensitive
to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition by the BH3-mimetic, ABT263.
To that end, we found that pharmacological inhibition of
Usp9X sensitized patient-derived xenograft cells (GBM12)
to the cytotoxic effects of ABT263 and that this effect is
synergistic. Moreover, we found that mechanistically
this effect was linked to WP1130-mediated suppression
of Mcl-1 protein levels, since Mcl-1 is a major factor of
resistance towards BH3-mimetic-mediated apoptosis
[24–30]. Along these lines, it is conceivable that Noxa upregulation caused by Usp9X inhibition might contribute
to the sensitization to BH3-mimetic cell death given
the pro-apoptotic effects of Noxa on Mcl-1 [31–33].
Our findings are in line with previous observations in
pancreatic cancer, in which cell death by another BH3mimetic was enhanced by blocking the binding of Usp9X
to Mcl-1 in vitro and in vivo [34]. However, even though
WP1130-mediated down-regulation of the Usp9X/Mcl-1
axis appears to contribute to the enhancement of the proapoptotic effect of ABT263 it is very likely that other
molecular alterations following treatment with WP1130
add to this effect as well.
Given our observations that loss-of Usp9X function
impaired expression of 1) the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
member Mcl-1, which has been previously shown to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis [35], and 2) also of the
IAPs, Survivin and XIAP [36, 37] we determined whether
antagonism of Usp9X function also primes glioblastoma
cells to the cytotoxic effects of the death ligand TRAIL
[37–43]. Our findings showed that interference with
Usp9X signaling rendered glioblastoma cell cultures
sensitive to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, which to the best
of our knowledge has not been reported thus far for any
tumor entity. Considering our observations with respect
to Bcl-2 family members and IAPs, Usp9X appears to
block death-receptor-mediated apoptosis most likely at the
level of initiator- as well as effector caspases, involving
a combination of factors. It appears less likely that the
endogenous inhibitor of caspase 8, c-FLIP [44], which akin
to Survivin and Mcl-1 is a molecule with a relatively short
half-life and is stabilized by chaperones and potentially
other deubiquitinases, is involved in TRAIL/WP1130mediated cell death, because an interaction of Usp9X and
c-FLIP has not been proven [45, 46]. In fact, c-FLIP served
as a negative control for its inability to bind to Usp9X [8].
A drawback of targeting TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in
glioblastoma is represented by findings that suggest that
certain death-receptors and caspase 8 levels are silenced
in a fraction of glioblastomas [47–49]. Despite some
controversy, targeting death-receptor-mediated apoptosis
appears to be still a viable option for the treatment of
glioblastoma, since recent results suggest that a smallmolecule inducer of TRAIL (ONC201/TIC10), which is
capable to cross the blood brain barrier, prolongs animal
survival singly and in combination with bevacizumab
[50]. Other approaches utilized stem cells that home to
brain tumors and secrete TRAIL, leading to suppression of
glioma growth in vivo [51].
Finally, we determined as to whether Usp9X
signaling is important in vivo. For that purpose, we
utilized a local-delivery pump system [52] to administer
WP1130 to intracranial proneural glioblastomas (PDGF+,
PTEN−/−, TP53−/−). We found that animals receiving
WP1130 lived longer, suggesting potential feasibility
of WP1130 as an anti-glioma drug. To the best of our
knowledge, our observation appears to be the first one
that highlights the potential applicability of WP1130 as
an anti-glioma compound. We further tested whether
WP1130 might also be used in drug combination
therapies in vivo and found that WP1130 enhanced the
effects of ABT263 in vivo without any detectable toxicity,
though more thorough analyses including hematological,
renal and hepatic function panels need to be done by
further studies. Although WP1130 has been studied in
drug combination in other tumor entities, such as the
combination of Prednisone and WP1130 in B-ALL, our
report is the first one that demonstrates that WP1130 might
be used in combination with other drugs in model systems
of glioblastoma. A recent study in multiple myeloma
modified the chemical structure of WP1130 and presented
a reagent that appeared to have stronger anti-myeloma
12800

Oncotarget

effects than WP1130 [7], suggesting that this modified
compound may bear stronger growth inhibitory effects
on glioblastoma models compared to WP1130. Whether
treatment with WP1130 would also enhance the antineoplastic activity of death-promoting ligands such as
TRAIL in glioblastoma models in vivo seems likely, but
remains to be validated by future studies.
Taken together, our findings highlight that targeting
Usp9X for glioblastoma is feasible and that inhibition of
Usp9X alone or along with other compounds significantly
impairs the growth of preclinical models of glioblastoma
in vitro and in vivo.

embedded in paraffin and 4 μm thick sections were cut prior
to staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Microphotographs
were taken at ×40 magnification.

SignalSilence® Usp9X siRNA I  #6308 was
purchased from CST. Non-targeting siRNA-pool (ONTARGETplus Non-targeting Pool, # D-001810-10-05)
and Mcl-1 (SMARTpool: ON-TARGETplus Mcl-1 siRNA,
L-004501-00-0005) were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) and transfected as previously
described [43, 60]. Briefly, cells were incubated for 6 h with
the formed complexes of Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and the respective siRNA (12-well
condition) in DMEM without FBS and antibiotics. After
6 h, FBS was added to a total concentration of 1.5%.

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s
t-test using Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
U.S.A.). A p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ,
U.S.A. – www.combosyn.com last accessed 06/01/15)
was used for the drug combination analysis including the
calculation of the combination index (CI) and isobologram.
A CI < 1 was considered as synergistic, a CI = 1 as additive
and a CI > 1 as antagonistic. The concentration for each
compound resulting in 50% inhibition (ED50) is normalized
to 1, plotted on x- or y-axis and connected by a line which
represents the ED50 isobologram. Data points of drug
combinations plotted below the connecting line represent
a synergistic interaction, data points located on the line
represent an additive interaction and data points located above
the connecting line represent an antagonistic interaction.

Orthotopic xenograft and convection-enhanced
delivery model
MGPP-3 murine glioblastoma xenografts were
stereotactically implanted into 6- to 8-week-old male
or female mice (Nu/Nu GFP) weighing 20 to 30 g as
previously described [56, 61]. The study was approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
Columbia University Medical Center. For the generation of
intracranial tumors, 25000 cells in 2 μL PBS (Gibco, Life
Technologies), were implanted into the right basal ganglia
of anesthetized mice using a small animal stereotactic
frame (Stoelting). Motorized injections were performed at
a rate of 0.3 μL/min.
Convection-enhanced delivery was performed as
described before [61, 62]. Five days after implantation
of tumor cells, alzet® micro-osmotic pumps (DURECT
Corporation, Cupertino, CA, U.S.A.) were implanted for
a 7-day long continuous intracranial infusion of WP1130
or solvent. To verify intracranial drug administration
1% Gadolinium was added to the pumps (Omniscan,
GE Healthcare Inc., Princeton, NJ, U.S.A.) and MRIs
(Bruker ICON™, 1 Tesla) were performed after removal
of the pump system. Survival was assessed by calculating
Kaplan–Meier curves.
