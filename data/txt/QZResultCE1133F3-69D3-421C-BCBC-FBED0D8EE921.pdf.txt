ABSTRACT
Two types of prognostic signatures for predicting recurrent risk of ER+ breast
cancer patients have been developed: one type for patients accepting surgery only and
another type for patients receiving post-operative tamoxifen therapy. However, the
first type of signature cannot distinguish high-risk patients who cannot benefit from
tamoxifen therapy, while the second type of signature cannot identify patients who
will be at low risk of recurrence even if they accept surgery only. In this study, we
proposed to develop two coupled signatures to solve these problems based on withinsample relative expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs. Firstly, we identified a
prognostic signature of post-operative recurrent risk using 544 samples of ER+ breast
cancer patients accepting surgery only. Then, applying this drug-free signature to
840 samples of patients receiving post-operative tamoxifen therapy, we recognized
553 samples of patients who would have been at high risk of recurrence if they had
accepted surgery only and used these samples to develop a tamoxifen therapy benefit
predictive signature. The two coupled signatures were validated in independent data.
The signatures developed in this study are robust against experimental batch effects
and applicable at the individual levels, which can facilitate the clinical decision of
tamoxifen therapy.

INTRODUCTION

ER+ breast cancer [6], the patients treated with tamoxifen
for a long time may suffer from side-effects, such as
deep-vein thrombosis, endometrial cancer, pulmonary
embolus, bone loss, stroke and genito-urinary system
dysfunction [7–9]. If patients at low risk after surgery can
be discriminated from patients at low risk with the help of
tamoxifen therapy, clinicians could make proper decisions
on tamoxifen therapy for the two distinct groups to assure
its effectiveness and minimize adverse treatment effects.
Many prognostic signatures, such as the 70-gene
signature reported by van‘t Veer et al. [10] and the 76-gene
signature reported by Wang et al. [11], have been developed
for predicting clinical outcome of ER+ breast cancer
patients accepting surgery only [12, 13]. Although these
drug-free prognostic signatures could be used to guide the
recommendation of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy based on the
finding that only patients in the high-risk group may benefit

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among
women worldwide and approximately 70% of cases
express estrogen receptor [1, 2]. Tamoxifen has been the
major adjuvant therapy for ER+ breast cancer, but onethird of early-stage patients treated with tamoxifen after
surgery for five years will experience a relapse of cancer
within fifteen years [3, 4]. To reduce the recurrent rate,
the majority of early-stage ER+ patients also receive
adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, of which only a
small proportion will ultimately benefit from the adjuvant
chemotherapy, while all remain at risk of toxic side-effects
[5]. Therefore, a signature for identifying patients who can
benefit from tamoxifen therapy is required. In addition,
although continuing tamoxifen therapy has been found
to produce a reduction in recurrence and mortality for

from tamoxifen therapy [14], they cannot further distinguish
high-risk patients who cannot benefit from tamoxifen
therapy. Some other researchers used samples of ER+ breast
cancer patients receiving post-operative tamoxifen therapy
to develop signatures for predicting clinical outcome of
these patients [15– 18]. Patients with low risk of recurrence
recognized by such signatures are considered to be able to
benefit from tamoxifen therapy and might be recommended
to tamoxifen therapy. However, some of these patients will
be at low risk of recurrence if they accept surgery only and
actually need no tamoxifen therapy after surgery. Obviously,
these problems need to be solved.
Most of previously reported signatures are based
on risk scores, usually calculated as some summaries of
expression measurements of the signature genes, to allocate
patients into different prognostic groups [10–12, 16–18].
However, such risk-score based signatures often fail in
independent samples [19–22] because risk scores summarized
from expression measurements of signature genes are
sensitive to experimental batch effects [22–24]. As the
applications of such risk-score based signatures require data
normalization using a set of samples [10–12, 16–18], the risk
classification of a sample depends on the risk composition
of the samples analyzed together with this sample [25]. In
contrast, the signatures based on the within-sample relative
expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs are insensitive to
experimental batch effects and invariable to monotonic data
normalization [22–25]. Based on this unique advantage, the
REO-type prognostic signatures can perform robustly in interlaboratory datasets and allow application at the individual
levels [15, 26]. Another important advantage of REOs is that
we can pool samples from different small datasets together
for further analysis, which is of special interest given that
the discovery and validation of prognostic signatures often
need a large number of samples [26]. However, one major
problem of finding REO-type prognostic signatures is that the
number of gene pairs constituted by all genes in a dataset is
extremely large, leading to a super-high dimensional problem
and consequently a over-fitting  problem [27]. To
improve the robustness of analytical results, a commonly
approach is to start with pathway analyses to develop a
signature based on the phenomenon that signatures identified
from different samples are often closely related in functions
[28, 29]. Our previous research has found that within-sample
REOs are overall stable in particular types of normal human
tissue but widely disturbed in the corresponding cancers,
which could provide the basis for pathway analysis based on
REOs [30].

(Affymetrix HG-U133A) (Table 1), we identified
22,717,681 stable gene pairs, each of which had a stable
REO in more than 99% of normal samples. Similarly,
we identified 45,603,713 stable gene pairs in 407 normal
breast tissue samples (Table 1) measured by the GPL570
platform (Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0). The two lists of
stable gene pairs had 17,507,393 overlaps, of which more
than 98% had identical REOs, which was highly unlikely
to occur by chance (p < 1.0E–16, binomial distribution
test, see Methods). The highly stable REOs reflect the
coordinated structure of gene expressions in the normal
breast tissue, based on which we could characterize every
cancer sample by identifying gene pairs with reversal
REOs in this sample [30]. In the following text, we used
the gene pairs with stable normal REOs consistently
detected by both the GPL96 and GPL570 platforms to
characterize cancer samples.
The 219 samples of lymph-node-negative patients
accepting surgery only, collected from the GSE7390 and
GSE6532_ut datasets (Table 1), were used as the discovery
cohort to develop a drug-free prognostic signature of
post-operative recurrent risk. Firstly, based on the 1320
canonical pathways documented in the C2 collection of the
MSigDB, we identified pathways whose disrupted REOs
were significantly associated with recurrence-free survival
(RFS). Here, RFS was used in a broad sense to represent
the prognostic end points of both local recurrence and
distant recurrence [47]. For each pathway, among the intrapathway gene pairs with stable REOs in normal tissue, the
frequency of gene pairs with reversal REOs in each cancer
sample was calculated, termed as the disruption index of
this pathway in this sample. Then, using the univariate
Cox proportional-hazard model, with FDR < 5%, we
identified 37 pathways whose disruption indexes were
significantly correlated with RFS (Supplementary Table 1).
To search for  significantly correlated RFS-relevant
pathways, we evaluated the correlations of the disruption
indexes among the RFS-relevant pathways using
Spearman rank  correlation  test with FDR < 5%. After
linking every two significantly correlated pathways
whose Spearman rank correlation coefficient was larger
than 0.6, we found 23 pathways that could be connected
together as a large network (Supplementary Figure 1).
Many of these 23 pathways are well-known metastasisassociated pathways, including P53 and RAS signaling
pathways, cell-cycle-related pathways and immunityrelated pathways, as described in Supplementary Table 1.
Finally, we searched for prognostic signature of gene pairs
within these 23 RFS-relevant pathways, which could be
regarded as the core drug-free RFS-relevant pathways.
By this way, the number of gene pairs to be searched was
greatly reduced, which was expected to be able to improve
the robustness of signature selection.
Within the 23 pathways, there were 19,844 gene pairs
with stable REOs in the normal breast tissue. From these
gene pairs, using the univariate Cox proportional-hazard

model, with FDR<10%, we indentified 138 gene pairs
whose reversal REOs were significantly correlated with poor
RFS (see Methods). From these 138 gene pairs, a forwardstepwise selection algorithm was performed to obtain a
subset of gene pairs whose C-index reached maximum (see
Methods) based on the following classification rule: patients
with no reversal gene pairs in the subset were assigned to
the low-risk group and all the other patients were assigned
to the high-risk group. Finally, we extracted nine gene pairs
(Table 3), termed as the drug-free prognostic signature of
post-operative recurrent risk, which classified the discovery
cohort into a low-risk group with 110 patients and a highrisk group with 109 patients. As shown in Figure 1A,
the patients in the low-risk group had significantly better
RFS than the patients in the high-risk group (HR = 3.99,
95%CI:2.47–6.45,  p = 1.02E–09, C-index = 0.69).
In the first independent validation cohort of the
GSE2034 dataset, the drug-free prognostic signature
identified 112 patients at low risk and 97 patients at
high risk, respectively, while the RFS of the former was
significantly better than that of the latter (HR = 1.95,
95%CI:1.25–3.04, p = 2.71E–03, C-index =  0.59,
Figure 1B). The drug-free prognostic signature was
also validated in another independent GSE4922_ut
dataset: the low-risk group of 82 patients had a
significantly better RFS than the high-risk group of
34 patients (HR = 2.61, 95%CI:1.31–5.19, p = 4.49E–03,
C-index = 0.60, Figure 1C). The first validation cohort
lacks clinical data, while multivariate Cox analyses for
the discovery cohort and the second validation cohort
both showed the drug-free prognostic signature was
a strong independent factor for predicting the postoperative recurrent risk after adjusting age, tumor size
and histology grade (Table 4).
Taken together, the above results demonstrated
that the drug-free prognostic signature could robustly
predict recurrent risk of ER+ breast cancer patients after
surgery.

For samples of ER+ breast cancer patients receiving
post-operative tamoxifen therapy, we firstly used the drugfree prognostic signature to recognize patients who would
have been at low risk of recurrence if they had accepted
surgery only, and then used the remained high-risk
samples to develop a therapy benefit predictive signature
for identifying patients who could benefit from tamoxifen
therapy (Figure 2).
Notably, the datasets of patients receiving postoperative tamoxifen therapy also included samples
of lymph-node-positive patients (Table 2). Under the
assumption that both lymph-node-positive and lymph-nodenegative patients with high risk of recurrence after surgery
would be the same likely to have micro-distant-metastases,
we pooled high-risk patients predicted from both lymphnode-positive and lymph-node-negative patients together as
the discovery cohort. For each of the four datasets including
both lymph-node negative and positive samples, we found
no differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the highrisk patients of the lymph-node positive and negative group
using Student’s t-test, with FDR < 5%. Similarly, no DEGs
were found between the low-risk patients of the lymphnode positive and negative group. On the other hand, we
found that DEGs between the high- and low-risk groups
for lymph-node negative patients was consistent with the
corresponding DEGs for lymph-node positive patients.
From the GSE17705 dataset, we detected 7075 and 6221
DEGs between the low- and high-risk groups for the lymphnode negative and positive patients, respectively. The two
lists of DEGs shared 5312 genes and they all showed the
same deregulation directions (up- or down-regulation) in
the high-risk patients compared with the low-risk patients,
which was highly unlikely to occur by chance ( p < 1.0E-16,
binomial distribution test). Similarly, for the GSE6532_tt1,
GSE6532_tt2 and GSE4922_tt datasets, the DEGs between
the distinct prognostic groups for lymph-node negative

The datasets in bold were discovery cohort.
patients were also highly consistent with the corresponding
DEGs for lymph-node positive patients (all p < 1.0E–16,
binomial distribution test). These results provided evidence
that the drug-free prognostic signature was independent of
the lymph-node status.
Applying the drug-free prognostic signature
to a total 521 samples of ER+ breast cancer patients
receiving post-operative tamoxifen therapy, collected in
the GSE17705, GSE12093 and GSE6532_tt1 datasets,
we recognized a total 320 high-risk patients (184, 68 and
68 in the three datasets, respectively). These 320 patients
who would have been at high-risk of recurrence if they
had accepted surgery only were used as discovery cohort
to develop a tamoxifen therapy predictive signature. Then,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we developed the tamoxifen therapy benefit predictive
signature in the same way of developing the drug-free
prognostic signature. Briefly, we firstly identified 89 RFSrelevant pathways using the univariate Cox proportionalhazard model with FDR < 5% (Supplementary Table 2),
and from which we further extracted 46 strongly
correlated pathways that could be connected together as a
large network by linking every two significantly correlated
pathways whose Spearman rank correlation coefficient
was larger than 0.6 (Supplementary Figure 2). We defined
the 46 pathways as the core tamoxifen-associated RFSrelevant pathways and some references suggesting
their relevance to tamoxifen resistance were listed in
Supplementary Table 2.

From 10,096 gene pairs with stable REOs within
these 46 pathways in the normal tissue, we identified
67 gene pairs whose reversal REOs were significantly
correlated with poor RFS using the univariate Cox
proportional-hazard model with FDR < 10%. From
these 67 gene pairs, we performed a forward-stepwise
selection algorithm to extract a subset of gene pairs with
the highest C-index based on the following classification
rule: patients were assigned to the tamoxifen benefit
group if no gene pair in the subset was reversed and all the
other were assigned to the tamoxifen non-benefit group.
Finally, a tamoxifen therapy benefit predictive signature
consisting of ten gene pairs (Table 5) was identified,
which allocated the 320 drug-free high-risk patients into
a tamoxifen benefit group of 168 patients and a tamoxifen
non-benefit group of 152 patients, respectively. The RFS
of the former was significantly better than that of the latter
(HR = 5.27, 95%CI:3.13–8.87, p = 3.03E-12, C-index =
0.70 Figure 3A).
In the first independent validation dataset
GSE6532_ tt2, for the 127 high-risk patients recognized by
the drug-free prognostic signature, 55 and 72 patients were
classified into tamoxifen benefit and non-benefit groups,
respectively, and the former had a significantly different
RFS from the latter (HR = 2.99, 95%CI:1.54– 5.82,
p = 7.26E-04, C-index = 0.64 Figure 3B). From the
independent GSE4922_tt and GSE9195 datasets, 34
and 72 drug-free high-risk patients were recognized
by the drug-free prognostic signature, respectively,
and we pooled them together as the second validation
cohort. The therapy benefit predictive signature could
stratify this validation cohort into a tamoxifen benefit
group of 85 patients and a tamoxifen non-benefit group

of 21 patients with significantly different RFS (HR =
3.38, 95%CI:1.65–6.92, p = 4.15E–04, C-index = 0.63
Figure 3C). In addition, for each of the discovery and
validation cohorts, the RFS of the tamoxifen benefit group
was not significantly different from that of the drug-free
low-risk group recognized by the drug-free prognostic
signature, while the latter group also had significantly
better RFS than the tamoxifen non-benefit group (Figure 4).
The similar results were observed when applying the two
coupled signatures to lymph-node-negative and lymphnode-positive patients separately (Supplementary Table 3).
A multivariate analysis in the discovery cohort was not
performed due to a number of missing values, while
multivariate Cox analyses for the two validation cohorts
both showed that the therapy benefit predictive signature
remained significantly associated with RFS after adjusting
for clinical factors of age, node status, tumor size and
histology grade (Table 6).
The GSE6532 series included 85 samples of
lymph-node-negative patients accepting surgery only
(GSE6532_ut) and 114 lymph-node-negative patients
treated with tamoxifen (GSE6532_tt1 and GSE6532_
tt2). Thus, we could compared RFS between the
tamoxifen-treated and the tamoxifen-untreated patients
in each of the three groups classified by the two coupled
signatures. As expected, in the drug-free low-risk group,
RFS of the 28 tamoxifen-treated patients were not
significantly different from that of the 43 tamoxifenuntreated patients (HR = 1.14, 95%CI:0.37–3.55,
p = 0.8179, Figure 5A). Also, in the tamoxifen nonbenefit group, the 49 tamoxifen-treated patients had no
significant better RFS than the 21 tamoxifen-untreated
patients (HR = 0.86, 95%CI:0.41 amoxifen- untreated

p1.79, p = 0.6940, Figure 5C). These results suggested
that both the drug-free low-risk patients and the
tamoxifen non-benefit patients could not benefit from
tamoxifen therapy. In contrast, in the tamoxifen benefit
group, the 37 tamoxifen-treated patients had a significant
better RFS than the 21 tamoxifen-untreated patients
(HR = 0.41, 95%CI:0.17–0.99, p = 0.0415, Figure 5B).
Similar comparison results were found in a merged
dataset that included 233 samples of lymph-nodenegative patients receiving post-operative tamoxifen
therapy (GSE17705, GSE4922_tt and GSE9195) and
459 samples of lymph-node-negative patients accepting
surgery only (GSE2034, GSE7390 and GSE4922_ut)
(Figure 5D, 5E, 5F). This comparison analysis could not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be performed for lymph-node-positive patients because
there were no samples of lymph-node-positive patients
without accepting tamoxifen therapy.
Taken together, the above results suggested that
the two coupled signatures could be used to facilitate the
clinical decision of tamoxifen therapy.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified a therapy benefit
predictive signature coupled with a drug-free prognostic
signature for early stage ER+ breast cancer patients. The
two signatures can be used sequentially to stratify early
stage ER+ breast cancer patients into three groups. The

first group includes patients who will be at low-risk of
recurrence if they accept surgery only, and we could
recommend them to accept no or a short duration of
tamoxifen treatment. The second group includes patients
who will be at high risk of post-operative recurrence but
can benefit from tamoxifen therapy. For these patients, the
decreased risk after tamoxifen therapy could be attributed
to the tamoxifen  efficacy, and thus tamoxifen therapy
could be recommended to them. For the third group of
patients who will keep at high risk after tamoxifen therapy,

we can infer that the routine clinical tamoxifen therapy
cannot improve their clinical outcomes. Different from
previously reported prognostic signature, the two coupled
signatures can find most of patients who could benefit
from tamoxifen therapy and the patients at low risk with
surgery only, and thus insulating them from cytotoxic
chemotherapy or even tamoxifen therapy.
Notably, for the third group of patients, we should
not simply infer that they are resistant to (or cannot
respond to) tamoxifen. Some of these patients, who

could have poor prognoses on account of their
resistance to drug-induced tumor cell apoptosis [48],
could be considered to be truly resistant to tamoxifen,
so prescription of other treatment modalities such as
chemotherapies or target therapies could be recommended
[49, 50]. However, a large portion of these patients could
respond to tamoxifen but the therapy efficacy may be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

insufficient in competition with tumor growth ability
[51, 52]. If this is the case, a larger dosage and longer
duration of tamoxifen therapy could be recommended
[53]. Thus, the therapy benefit predictive signature can be
regarded as an apparently resistant signature which can
be used to predict whether the prognosis of a patient can
be improved by the routine clinical tamoxifen therapy.

To identify a drug resistant signature for discriminating
patients who can respond to tamoxifen, we need gene
expression data of responders an non-responders of
patients accepting tamoxifen therapy, which, however,
are currently unavailable for post-operative patients.
Nevertheless, samples of metastatic patients accepting
tamoxifen therapy, whose response to the treatment can be
clearly defined [54], could be subjected to gene expression
profiling to develop the drug resistant signature .
In clinical practice, almost all lymph-node positive
patients undergo lymphadenectomy [55] and after that
they should have low risk of recurrence if they have no
micro-distant-metastases. We assumed that high-risk
patients predicted from either the lymph-node negative
or positive group by the drug-free prognostic signature
would be the same likely to have micro-distant-metastases.
Thus, the signature should be independent of the lymphnode status, as evidenced by the observation that the
transcriptome difference between the distinct prognostic
groups for lymph-node negative samples was consistent
with the corresponding difference for lymph-node
positive samples and no transcriptome difference could be
observed between the same prognostic groups predicted
from the lymph-node positive and negative patients. All of
these suggested that high-risk patients of the lymph-node
positive and negative group possess similar molecular
characteristics.
For clinical application, we can develop a custom
array or RT-PCR kit to measure expression intensities
of the 32 genes included in the two coupled signatures
to determine the REOs of the signature gene pairs.
Compared with the microarray technique, the RTPCR technique is more reliable and reproducible for
quantitation of transcriptional abundance of genes.
Notably, the problem of experimental batch effect and
data normalization also exists when RT-PCR is used
to measure gene expression intensities [56]. However,
it can be expected that REOs deduced from gene
intensities measured by RT-PCR tend to be robust against
experimental batch effects.
Due to the high-dimension problem inherent in
microarray data, especially when we focus on analyzing
a huge number of gene pairs, the identification of disease
signatures is liable to false discoveries [27]. Through
mapping gene pairs into pathways, we started with
pathways to improve the robustness of the identification
of signatures. As demonstrated in this study, the identified
signatures can perform robustly in independent datasets.
However, due to the limited gene annotation to biological
pathways [57, 58], some important pathways associated
with survival might be missed. A method worth exploring
is to augment annotated genes of pathways using genes
that are closely linked with intra-pathway genes in proteinprotein interaction network [59, 60].
In this study, in order to ensure the robustness of
signature  performance in samples detected by different
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Affymetrix platforms, GPL96 and GPL570, we defined
stable gene pairs commonly detected by the two platforms
as the ultimate stable gene pairs. Because different platforms
have different probe designs and experimental protocol,
some gene pairs may not keep consistent REOs in different
platforms. Further study is needed to evaluate whether the
two coupled signatures indentified in this study are suitable
for microarray data produced by other platforms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data and pre-processing
All gene expression datasets for normal breast
tissue and ER+ breast cancer were collected from GEO
[61], as described in detail in Table 1. All samples used
in this study fell into three categories: samples of normal
breast tissue for identifying gene pairs with stable REOs
in normal breast tissue, samples of ER+ lymph-nodenegative breast cancer patients accepting surgery only
for developing a drug-free prognostic signature and
samples of post-operative tamoxifen-treated ER+ breast
cancer patients for developing a therapy benefit predictive
signature. The third category included both lymph-nodenegative and lymph-node-positive patients, while most
of them are in early stage (Table 2). RFS served as the
prognosis endpoint, representing both disease-free survival
and distant metastasis-free survival [47].
All the above-mentioned data were produced by
the GPL96 or GPL570 platform. For each of the datasets,
raw intensity files (.CEL) were processed using the
RMA algorithm for background adjustment and median
polish summarization without quantile normalization
[62]. With the custom CDF file, each probe set ID was
mapped to Gene ID, and then probe sets that mapped to
multiple Gene IDs or did not map to any Gene ID were
removed. The expression measurements of all probe sets
corresponding to the same Gene ID were averaged to
obtain a single measurement (on the log2 scale). The raw
mRNA expression data of the post-operative tamoxifen
treated patients were processed with the RMA quantile
normalization algorithm in order to select DEGs between
the high- and low-risk patients predicted by the drug-free
prognostic signature.
The annotation data of 1320 canonical pathways,
covering 8428 unique genes, were downloaded from the
C2 collection of MSigDB (Version 4.0, updated May 31,
2013) [63] for personalized pathway analysis.

Consistency evaluation of stable REOs detected
by different platforms
We focused on analyzing the 12752 genes
measured by both the GPL96 and GPL570 platforms.
For a collection of normal breast samples measured by
a particular platform, if gene A had a higher (or smaller)
12

Oncotarget

expression level than gene B in more than 99% normal
samples, then the gene pair (A,B) was defined as stable
gene pair. Based on the overlapping stable gene pairs
detected by both the GPL96 and GPL570 platforms, a
consistency score was calculated as the percentage of
stable gene pairs with identical REOs in both collections
of normal samples. We evaluated whether the consistency
score was higher than what expected by chance using the
binomial distribution test as following:

pairs that resulted in the highest C-index. Starting with the
intra-pathway gene pair with the largest C-index as the
seed signature, candidate intra-pathway gene pairs were
added to the signature one at a time until the addition of
one gene pair did not improve predictive performance.

Survival analysis

REFERENCES

The univariate Cox proportional-hazards model [64]
was used to evaluate the correlation of disruption indexes
of pathways with the RFS and to evaluate whether a gene
pair’s reversal REOs were significantly correlated with
poor RFS. When identifying RFS relevant gene pairs,
we characterized REO of intra-pathway gene pairs for
each sample as a binary vector in which 0 represented the
REO of the intra-pathway gene pair in a cancer sample
in line with that in normal tissue while 1 represented
reversal REO. Kaplan-Meier survival plots and logrank tests [65] were used to evaluate the differences in
RFS of distinct groups. The Cox proportional-hazards
model was also performed to calculate the hazard ratios
(HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The
independent prognostic value of a signature was assessed
by multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model. To
evaluate the predictive performance of a signature we
adopted the concordance index (C-index), which is a
measure of overall concordance between predicted risk
scores and observed RFS [66]. C-index, ranging from
0.5 (indicating random chance) to 1 (indicating perfect
discrimination), is one of the most appropriate index for
studies focusing on long-term risk prediction [67]. The
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction was
used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) [68]. All
statistical analyses were performed using the R software
package version 3.0.1.
