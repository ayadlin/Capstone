ABSTRACT
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is widely used as a nutritional supplement due
to its putative anti-aging properties. However, the effect of DHEA in Leydig cells,
a major target cell of DHEA biotransformation in male, are not clear. The present
study aimed to investigate the preventative effect of DHEA on oxidative damage
and apoptosis after H2O2 treatment in Leydig cells. The results showed that DHEA
treatment attenuated the reduction of cell viability induced by H2O2. No differences
were observed on the superoxide anion (O2-) content, while DHEA treatment decreased
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) content in H2O2-treated
Leydig cells. Pre-treatment with DHEA increased peroxidase (POD) activity and
decreased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in H2O2-treated Leydig cell. DHEA
treatment attenuated DNA damage as indicated by the decreasing of tail moment,
comet length and olive tail moment. Total apoptosis ratio and early apoptosis ratio
were significantly decreased in H2O2-treated Leydig cell that were pre-treatment
with DHEA. DHEA treatment decreased Bax, capase-9 and capase-3 mRNA levels in
H2O2-treated Leydig cells. Our results demonstrated that pre-treatment with DHEA
prevented the Leydig cells oxidative damage caused by H2O2 through increasing POD
activity, which resulted in inhibition of •OH generation. Meanwhile, pre-treatment
with DHEA inhibited H2O2-induced Leydig cells early apoptosis which mainly by
reducing the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and caspases-9, caspases-3 mRNA levels. This
information is important to understand the molecular mechanism of anti-ageing effect
and potential application in treatment of oxidative stress induced related diseases
of DHEA.

INTRODUCTION

acute and chronic oxidative stress experiments [7-10].
However, the effects of DHEA administration can be
antioxidant [11] or pro-oxidant [12, 13], depending on
the administered dose and specific tissue [14]. Gallo et
al. reported that slightly higher concentrations of DHEA
protected cells against lipid peroxidation induced by
oxidative stress while pharmacological doses of DHEA
displayed a pro-oxidant activity [15]. In addition,
microsomes isolated from DHEA-treated rats are resistant
to iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, whereas microsomes
pre-incubated with DHEA in vitro are not resistant,
suggesting that a cell or tissue dependent signaling or
transformation is required for DHEA’s antioxidant action
[16].
Aging results in the progressive deterioration of
physiological function, and free radical theory is the

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an important
precursor of activate steroid hormone, is produced
abundantly by the adrenal cortex with an age-dependent
pattern [1]. Age-dependent decrease of DHEA production
has attracted extensive attention due to its possible
benefit to psychological well-being in the elderly [2].
The literature evidences reveal the changes in DHEA
level are associated with multiple pathologies, whereas
a replacement therapy might alleviate age-associated
declines in physiological functions [3-7]. This results in
a large-scale self-administration of DHEA as an “antiageing” drug in dietary supplement. Many studies had
reported that DHEA had antioxidant effects in various

most accepted ageing theories [17]. In aging process,
reactive oxygen species (ROS), can be generated; reactive
oxygen species is toxic at high concentrations [17]. ROS
can interact with many molecules which will result in
DNA mutation, protein denaturation, lipid peroxidation,
membrane destruction and so on [18]. Furthermore,
excess ROS can activate apoptotic pathways [19]; a
biochemical hallmark of apoptosis is DNA damage [20].
Administration of antioxidants attenuates free radicalmediated oxidative damage in several organs including the
testis [21]. Oxidative stress plays a key role in cell damage
[22] and the risk of oxidative damage is especially high for
steroid synthesizing tissues, which use molecular oxygen
for steroids biosynthesis [23]. The study shows that DHEA
exerts its effects by rapidly transforming into biologically
active steroids in target tissues [24]. It had proposed that
increasing serum DHEA (60-79 years old) concentration
to the levels found in young people may have antiageing effects [1]. Our previous study demonstrated
that administration of DHEA markedly increased serum
testosterone concentration in rats [25]. In males, ~95%
of androgen biosynthesis and secretion occurs in Leydig
cells, and it had been certified that functional changes

in Leydig cells is account for the observed reduction in
serum testosterone level [2].
Taken these points together, we presumed that
DHEA protects cell from oxidative damage, which might
be a major reason for the anti-ageing action of DHEA. In
addition, the effect of DHEA on the antioxidant function
of Leydig cells, a major target cell of DHEA convert to
active steroids, is unknown. Thus, the present study aimed
to investigate the effect of DHEA on ROS generation,
antioxidant enzymes activity, DNA damage, cell apoptosis
and apoptosis-related factors in H2O2-treated rat Leydig
cells, and this information is important to understand the
molecular mechanism of anti-ageing action of DHEA.

were significantly higher in cells exposed to 300μM H2O2
when compared to the H2O2-free control (P < 0.05) (Table

DNA damage in a dose-dependent pattern (Figure 4). As
shown in Table 2, pre-treatment with 50-100μM DHEA
significantly decreased comet length relative to that in

were significantly increased in H2O2-treated group when

low doses of H2O2 induces apoptosis in a variety of cell
types, thereby directly establishing oxidative stress as a
mediator of cell death [29, 30]. The high doses of H2O2
have been shown to be cytotoxic by triggering a disorderly
form of cell death, or necrosis [30, 31]. Thus, we used
300μM H2O2 treatment in the subsequent experiments,
and the results showed that H2O2 significantly increased
ROS content and total apoptosis ratio in Leydig cells.
Meanwhile, the comet assay showed that Leydig cells
exposed to 300μM H2O2 exhibited a significant increase
in comet length, tail moment and olive tail moment.
These results indicated that H2O2 caused oxidative stress,
providing a model for further investigation the protective
effect of DHEA on H2O2-induced oxidative damage in
Leydig cells.
Previous studies had reported that administration
of DHEA produce a number of beneficial effects in
elderly [1-4, 6]. This study found that pre-treatment
with DHEA decreased the ROS content by inhibiting
•OH generation and prevented cell death induced by
H2O2. This is consistent with the results of Gabriel et al.
[10], who reported that DHEA reduced ROS content in

(P < 0.05). Pre-treatment with DHEA has no effect on
Bcl-2 mRNA level (P>0.05) (Figure 6B), while Bax and
capase-3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in 10100μM DHEA-pretreated group relative to that in H2O2treated group (P < 0.05) (Figure 6A and 6D). Compared to
H2O2-treated group, pre-treatment with 10μM and 100μM
DHEA significantly decreased capase-9 mRNA level (P <
0.05) (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
In aging individuals, lipid peroxidation, oxidative
stress and damage of cellular macromolecules caused
by the excessive reactive oxygen species has been
hypothesized to be one of the major contributors to the
aging process [23]. As one of the most important ROS,
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been extensively used to
induce oxidative stress in vitro models [28]. Our results
showed that the cell viability significantly decreased in
300-1000μM H2O2-treated groups than that in H2O2free group. Previous study had reported that exposure to

ovariectomized rats. Oxidative stress defined as excessive
production of ROS include O2-, H2O2 and •OH, and
excessive ROS is toxic to human body [17]. Many recent
evidences indicate that endogenous free radicals contribute
to spontaneous mutagenesis by directly inducing DNA
damage [32]. Pre-treatment with DHEA prevented H2O2induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent pattern in
Leydig cells, as suggested by the decrease of comet length,
tail moment and olive tail moment in DHEA-treated
groups. Based on the data above, we presumed that DHEA
might prevent DNA oxidative damage in H2O2-induced
Leydig cells by inhibiting •OH generation.
It is well-known that body utilizes non-enzymatic
and enzymatic antioxidants to avoid or to retard cellular
damage arising from oxidative stress [10]. The antioxidant
enzyme activity maintain the balance between the
formation and scavenging of ROS [33, 34]. No changes
were observed on the SOD and CAT activities, while pretreatment with 50μM and 100μM DHEA significantly
increased POD activity in H2O2-treated Leydig cells.
DHEA supplementation demonstrated the antioxidant
effects in various acute and chronic oxidative stress
experiments in rodents [36]. It had reported that DHEA
exhibits antioxidant properties by suppressing superoxide
anion production [35]. Another antioxidant factor is the
reduced glutathione (GSH), which act as a substrate in the
detoxification of xenobiotic and in control of hydrogen
peroxide and other peroxides concentrations [9]. Our
results showed that 1μM and 10μM DHEA treatment
decreased GSH-Px activity in H2O2-treated Leydig cells.
NADPH is a cofactor required for the conversion of GSSG
to GSH by glutathione reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is an important enzyme involved
in the production of NADPH [21]. In vivo and in vitro
studies had shown that DHEA inhibits G6PDH activity
which in turn reduced the production of NADPH [9, 21].
Thus, we speculated that DHEA decreased NADPH level
through inhibiting G6PDH activity and finally decreased
GSH-Px activity in H2O2-induced Leydig cells. These
result indicated that pre-treatment with DHEA increased
POD activity which results in the decrease of ROS
contents in H2O2-treated Leydig cells.
Present study showed that pre-treatment with1μM
and 10μM DHEA significantly decreased the total
apoptosis ratio and early apoptosis ratio, but not the
late apoptosis ratio. This result indicated that DHEA
prevented H2O2-induced Leydig cells apoptosis and this
action was achieved mainly through inhibiting early
apoptosis. Permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer
membrane allows the release of pro-apoptotic factors
from intermembrane space into cytosol in early apoptosis
[37]. Cytochrome c release can promotes and amplify the
apoptotic cascade, which is considered as the commitment
step of programmed cell death [37-39]. The Bcl-2 family
proteins, including Bax and Bcl-2, are key regulators in
the early stages of apoptotic [40-44]. Our results showed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that pre-treatment with 10-100μM DHEA decreased the
pro-apoptotic protein Bax mRNA level in H2O2-treated
Leydig cells, while there is no effect on anti-apoptotic
protein Bcl-2 mRNA level. It well known that depending
on the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, sequential activation of caspases-9
and caspases-3 plays a central role in the execution of
cell apoptosis [45-47]. Our results also found that pretreatment with 1-100μM DHEA significantly decreased
the caspases-3 mRNA levels in H2O2-treated Leydig cells.
In addition, pre-treatment with10μM and 100μM DHEA
treatment decreased the caspases-9 mRNA levels in H2O2treated Leydig cells. These results indicated that DHEA
prevented H2O2-induced Leydig cells apoptosis mainly
through inhibiting pro-apoptotic protein Bax mRNA
levels which resulted in the decreasing of caspases-9 and
caspases-3 mRNA levels.
In conclusion (as shown in Figure 7), our results
demonstrated that pre-treatment with DHEA prevented
H2O2-induced Leydig cells oxidative damage by
increasing the POD activity which result in the inhibition
of •OH generation, and it decreased H2O2-induced Leydig
cells apoptosis through decrease the pro-apoptotic protein
Bax and caspases-9, caspases-3 mRNA levels. This
information shed light on the potential application for
DHEA in elderly and treatment of oxidative stress induced
related diseases. Certainly, further studies are warranted
to better understand the underlying mechanisms on how
DHEA prevents oxidative damage in the cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of primary Leydig cells
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (200±20g) were
purchased from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
Animals were housed under 25 °C and 50% humidity
with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The food and water were
available ad libitum. All animal handling procedures were
performed in strict accordance with guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals central of the Nanjing
Agricultural University. The protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing
Agricultural University. All experiments were performed
under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were
made to minimize suffering.
Leydig cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion
and purified by a discontinuous Percoll gradient, as
described by Murugesan et al. [23]. Briefly, testes
were decapsulated with fine forceps without breaking
the seminiferous tubules and digested in DMEM-F12
containing collagenase (0.5%) at 37°C for 15min in
shaking water bath. After incubation, collagenase-free
DMEM-F12 was added to each reaction tube which

was allowed to stand for 3min at room temperature.
Supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 2500×g
for 5min at 4°C. The pellet resuspended in 2mL of
DMEM-F12 was used as a crude testicular interstitial
cell suspension, which was subject to discontinuous
Percoll gradients for further purification. Two millilitre of
75% Percoll gradient was added to the centrifuge tube.
Above this layer, 70%, 58%, 30% and 5% gradients of
Percoll were laid gently one over the other. 2mL of crude
Leydig cell suspension was then applied on top of this
discontinuous gradient and centrifuged at 3000×g for
30min at 4°C. After centrifugation, most of Leydig cells
were observed in 30% Percoll gradients. Leydig cells were
transferred to centrifuge tube containing DMEM-F12
medium. After mixing, the tube was centrifuged at
2500×g for 10min at 4°C. Cell purity was assessed by
histochemical localization analysis of 3β-HSD according
to Aldred & Cooke [26]. Leydig cells were incubated
with to DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 5mg/mL transferrin, 2mM L-glutamine,
1.75mM HEPES, 100IU/mL penicillin and 100mg/mL
streptomycin, and cultured in an atmosphere of 95% air
and 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Cells were grown in 6-well plates (1×105 cells/well)
and treated with 0, 1, 10, 50 or 100μM DHEA for 24h,
and then exposed to 300μM H2O2 for 8h. After incubation,
the cells were then harvested, disrupted ultrasonically
in ice and centrifuged at 2500×g for 10min at 4°C.
The supernatants were collected and stored -20°C for
subsequent analysis. The superoxide dismutase (SOD),
glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT),
peroxidase (POD) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA)
contents were determined using commercially available
assay kits (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China)
following the manufacturers’ protocols.

Reactive oxygen species content detected
ROS and O2- content were measured with the
fluoroprobe 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(H2DCF-DA) and dihydroethidium (DHE), as previously
described [27]. Briefly, cells were incubated with DHEA
(0, 1, 10, 50 or 100μM) for 24h and then exposed to
300μM H2O2 for 8h. After incubation, cells were washed
and incubated with 5mM H2DCF-DA or 2mM DHE for
30min at 37°C. The cells were washed and collected
by centrifugation and suspended in PBS. Fluorescent
intensity was measured by a FACSCalibur™ flow
cytometry (Becton Dickinson, USA). Hydroxyl radical
(•OH) contents were determined spectrophotometrically
using commercially available assay kit (Biyuntian
Bioengineering Institute, China) following the
manufacturer’s protocols.

The concentration of testosterone in primary Leydig
cells under basal or stimulated conditions was determined
with RIA kit. After culturing for 24 h in DMEM-F12
medium at 37°C, cells were incubated with DHEA (0μM,
1μM, 50μM or 100μM) for 24 h, partly cells was collected
and other cells was exposed to 300μM H2O2 for 8h. After
incubation, cells were disrupted ultrasonically on ice and
centrifuged at 2500×g for 10min at 4°C. The testosterone
concentrations in the supernatants were determined (intravariation coefficients < 10%, inter-variation coefficients
< 15%).

Assessment of DNA damage by the alkaline comet
assay
DNA damage in Leydig cells was evaluated using
a Trevigen Comet AssayTM kit (Trevigen Inc., USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells
were incubated with DHEA (0, 1, 10, 50 or 100μM) for 24h
and then exposed to 300μM H2O2 for 8h. After incubation,
cells were washed and suspended in cold PBS at 1×105
cells/mL. 50μL cells suspension and 500μL low-melting
agarose (1%) were mixed and spread onto the comet slide,
another layer of 1% agarose gel was then added. The slide
was immersed in lysis buffer (2.5M NaCl, 100mM EDTA,
10mM Tris-base, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, 1% Triton
X-100, pH10) for at least 60 min at 4°C. Denaturation was
performed in an alkali solution (300mM NaOH, 1mM
EDTA, pH13.5) for 20min in the dark. The slide was then
transferred to fresh alkaline (300mM NaOH, 1mM EDTA,
pH13.5) and subjected to electrophoresis at 1V/cm,
300mA for 40min in darkness at 4°C. Thereafter, the slides

Cells were seeded on a 96-well plate (1×105 cells/
well) and treated with 0, 1, 10, 50 or 100μM DHEA
for 24h, then exposed to 300μM H2O2 for another 8h
before addition of MTT solution. H2O2-free control
cultures received an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, not exceeding 0.1%). 20μL of 5mg/mL MTT
(3- [4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide) were added to each well. After 4h of culture,
the culture medium was removed and the blue formazan
crystals that had formed were dissolved in 50μL DMSO.
The optical density of the formazan generated from MTT
was measured at 490nm using a Microplate reader (BioRad, USA).

pH7.4) and immersed in ice cold 100% ethanol for 5min
and air-dried. DNA was stained with 50mL of SYBR dye
for 20min in the refrigerator and immediately analyzed
using a Nikon epifluorescence microscope. For each slide,
50 randomly chosen comets were analyzed using a Nikon
epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescent images of single
cells were captured and computed for comet parameters:
comet length, tail moment, olive tail moment, head DNA
and tail DNA, using the Biolab Comet v1.0 image analysis
software.

Data were expressed as means ± SD and differences
were considered significant at P < 0.05. The effect of
DHEA on testosterone and the cell viability induced by
H2O2 were analyzed by t-test. Other data were analyzed
with one-way ANOVA and treatment differences were
subjected to a Duncan’s multiple comparison tests. All
statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 13.0 for
Windows (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).

Annexin V/propidium iondine staining assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Cells undergoing apoptosis were determined
using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine (PI) dual
staining and measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells
were incubated with DHEA (0, 1, 10, 50 or 100μM)
for 24h and then exposed to 300μM H2O2 for 8h. After
incubation, the cells were harvested and washed with cold
phosphate buffered saline. 200μL of Annexin V-FITC
stock solution was added to the cells and incubation
continued for 30min at 4°C in the dark. This was followed
by a further incubation with the propidium iodide
solution (10μL, containing RNase). The cells were then
immediately detected by FACSCalibur™ flow cytometry
(Becton Dickinson, USA) to measure the cell apoptosis.
Approximately 10,000 cells were analyzed in each sample.

After treatment, total RNA was extracted from cells
using the Trizol reagent (TaKaRa, Japan), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA concentration
was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260nm
(Eppendorf Biophotometer, Germany). 2μg of total RNA
were reverse transcribed by incubation for 1h at 37◦C
in a 25μL mixture comprising of 100U M-KGV reverse
transcriptase, 8U RNase inhibitor, 0.5μg of oligo (dT),
50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 3mM MgCl2, 75mM KCl,
10mM DDT and 0.8mM dNTP. An aliquot of cDNA
sample was mixed with 25μL SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (TaKaRa, Japan), in the presence of 10pmol of
forward and reverse primer for β-actin (use as an internal
control), Bax, Bcl-2, capase-9 and capase-3 (Table 1). All
samples were analyzed in duplicate using an ABI Prism
7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Sweden) using a program of 95°C for 1min, followed by
35 cycles 95°C for 30s, 60°C for 30s and 72°C for 20s.
Fold changes were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method.
The primers were designed using Primes Premier 5 and
synthesized by Takara Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Dalian,
China).
