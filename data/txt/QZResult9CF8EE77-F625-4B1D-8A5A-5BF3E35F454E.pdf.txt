Abstract
The Siah (seven in absentia homolog) family of RING-domain
proteins are components of ubiquitin ligase complexes, targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation. Siah family
members have been reported to function in Ras, estrogen,
DNA-damage, and hypoxia response pathways. Although earlier reports implicated Siah proteins as tumor suppressors,
recent studies in mouse models have shown that Siah inhibition impairs tumor growth and metastasis. Given their central
role in oncogenic and angiogenic pathways, Siah proteins are
attractive novel therapeutic targets in cancer. [Cancer Res

A Small Family of Highly Homologous E3 Ubiquitin
Ligases

Siah as a Tumor Suppressor Protein

Experiments two decades ago described the first member of the
family, seven in absentia (sina), as a protein required for formation
of the R7 photoreceptor in Drosophila (1). Subsequent genetic and
biochemical experiments showed that sina targeted a transcriptional repressor, tramtrack, for proteolytic degradation, allowing
a key cell-fate decision in the developing fly eye (2). This observation was key in linking sina function to protein turnover. Sina
homologs (Siah) were first isolated in mice (3), and found to be
highly homologous across species. The human Siah family consists
of Siah1 and Siah2, products of separate genes, with apparently
distinct but overlapping functions. In mice, the Siah1 and Siah2
proteins are nearly identical to the human proteins, but there
are two Siah1 forms, Siah1a and 1b, expressed from different
genes (4).

Structure and Function
Structurally, the Siah family have a divergent N-terminal 40 to 80
residues, but are highly conserved through the remaining RING domain and C-terminal, substrate-binding domain (3). The crystal
structure of the substrate-binding domain is homologous to tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) proteins
(5) and subsequent studies showed that Siah2, via degradation of
TRAF2, was a regulator of TRAF2 signaling (6). Siah family proteins
can interact with a multitude of cellular proteins as diverse as scaffold proteins such as phyllopod, transcriptional repressors such as
tramtrack and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR), the motor
protein Kid, the oncogene β-catenin, and the tumor suppressor
TGF-β induced early gene (TIEG-1); a more extensive list can be
found in ref. (7). In Drosophila, a ubiquitin ligase complex comNote: C.M. House and A. Möller contributed equally to this work.

prising Ebi, phyllopod, and sina interact to target tramtrack for
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (8). In mammals, a similar ubiquitin ligase complex is formed, comprising Siah1, Ebi, and SIP
(Siah interacting protein). Akin to the well-described anaphase
promoting complex (APC) and Skp1/Cullin/F-box complex (SCF;
ref. 9), the Siah/Epi/SIP complex functions in the ubiquitinationdegradation of β-catenin (10). Siah contains a functionally important binding groove that recognizes a peptide motif within many
substrates and adaptors (11). The crystal structure of a motifcontaining peptide bound to Siah has been solved (12, 13), and
competitive binding at this groove can inhibit Siah function
in vivo (14).

Early reports suggested that Siah proteins, in particular Siah1,
may function as tumor suppressor proteins on the basis of upregulation in revertants of transformed cells (reviewed in
ref. 15). Over-expression of Siah1 was also shown to cause growth
arrest (16) or to be pro-apoptotic. Introduction of Siah1 into U937
cells suppressed the tumorigenicity of these cells when injected
into scid/scid mice (15). Later experiments showed that Siah1
was involved in the degradation of the oncogene β-catenin, via
interactions with the proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
and Siah-interacting protein (SIP; refs. 10, 17). This noncanonical
signaling pathway links β-catenin degradation to genotoxic stress
and p53 activation (Fig. 1). If Siah proteins are tumor suppressors,
mutation could be expected in human cancer but so far there is
limited evidence for this, with only one report of a low frequency
of inactivating mutations in gastric cancer (18) and a failure to
find mutations in other cancer types (19).
Expression data has shown Siah2 to be strongly up-regulated in
estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors. 3 Previous data
showed that Siah2 controls protein levels of the repressor of ER
signaling, N-CoR (Fig. 1; ref. 20). Intuitively, inhibition of Siah2
should stabilize NCoR and thus inhibit ER signaling. A recent report, however, has shown that low levels of Siah2 expression correlate with more advanced, and tamoxifen-resistant ER-positive
tumors (21).

Knockout Mice Define In vivo Roles
Given that Siah proteins have been found to bind and degrade a
wide range of proteins, Siah1a and Siah2 gene-ablated mice have
been valuable in establishing the significance of biochemical and
cell biological studies. Siah1a null mice are subviable and display
a meiotic block at metaphase I that impairs spermatogenesis and
causes sterility in male mice (22). Although Siah2 null mice are outwardly normal in appearance (23), compound Siah1a/Siah2 mutation is lethal, implying a level of functional redundancy (23). There

Figure 1. Siah proteins in cancer-related signaling
pathways. Summary of aspects of the involvement
of Siah proteins in cancer. Hypoxia: Siah
proteins polyubiquitinate negative regulators of
hypoxia signaling, PHD and FIH, to allow
stabilization of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions.
Hypoxic conditions enhance the interaction of Siah
and HIPK2, leading to HIPK2 degradation and
derepression of hypoxia induced genes. DNA
damage: Siah expression is induced by p53 and
via a multiprotein complex regulates β-catenin
degradation. The interaction of Siah-1 with the p53
kinase HIPK2 is destabilized by DNA damage,
through the influence of ATM/ATR. Ras signaling:
Loss of function experiments show that Siah
proteins are effectors of Ras signaling and that
inhibition of Siah reduces tumor growth in
multiple models. Siah interacts with the negative
regulator of Ras signaling, Spry2, resulting in its
degradation. Inflammation: Siah interacts with
Traf2, resulting in diminished NF-κB activation
after TNF-α stimulation. Siah is required for innate
immune responses in C. elegans and increases
IL-6 and NF-κB levels. Estrogen signaling: Siah
proteins are induced in human breast cancer
cells by estrogen and degrade the co-repressor
N-CoR, enhancing estrogen signaling. References

is no apparent increase in tumor incidence in Siah1a or Siah2
knockout mice, as might be expected with deletion of a tumor suppressor protein. Interestingly, contrary to previous studies linking
Siah proteins with p53 signaling, Siah expression has been shown
to be stable in mouse tissues and primary cells following activation
of endogenous p53 by genotoxic stress (24). Importantly, p53 signaling, including up-regulation of p21, seemed normal in primary
fibroblasts that lacked Siah genes (24). Recently, Siah1 has been
reported as central to a conserved module involved in the innate
immune response in Caenorhabditis elegans (25) and has been previously associated with immune signaling involving TRAF2 (6) and
TNF-α (5).

Siah and the Hypoxic Response
One of the most striking roles for Siah proteins has been their
demonstrated involvement in hypoxia signaling, via regulation of
the key pro-angiogenic factor, HIF-1α. Siah proteins target for degradation prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) that are responsible for the
post-transcriptional modification of HIF-1α, facilitating HIF-1α
stabilization under hypoxic conditions (ref. 26 and reviewed in
ref. 7). Siah2 knockout mice have a delayed and abrogated response to hypoxic conditions (26). At a cellular and tissue level,
exposure of Siah2 mutants to hypoxia leads to significantly lower
protein levels of HIF-1α, resulting in reduced hypoxia-induced
gene expression (26).4 These data suggest a potential for inhibition
of the protumorigenic hypoxic response pathway by inhibition of
Siah action (Fig. 1).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (23). December 1, 2009

In two recent publications, a new layer of complexity to Siah's
involvement in hypoxia and DNA damage has been added. The tumor suppressor HIPK2 has been shown to be a novel substrate of
Siah proteins, whereby Siah1 (but not Siah2) is phosphorylated by
ATM/ATR after DNA damage (27). This phosphorylation prevents
the interaction of HIPK2 and Siah1, thereby stabilizing HIPK2, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. In a second study, Siah2 was
shown to regulate HIPK2 levels under hypoxia (28), whereby HIPK2
directly phosphorylates Siah2 (but not Siah1) resulting in a disruption of the HIPK2/Siah2 interaction, thus stabilizing HIPK2 and
promoting apoptosis (Fig. 1). Previously, HIPK2 has been shown
to phosphorylate p53 at Ser46 (29), contributing to p53-mediated
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The new findings that Siah proteins
are potent negative regulators of HIPK2 open up the possibility
that inhibition of Siah might result in elevated levels of HIPK2,
thereby sensitizing cells to DNA damage-induced, p53-dependent
apoptosis.

Siah and Ras Signaling in Cancer
Sina was first identified as being required downstream of Ras signaling in the Drosophila eye (1). Pancreatic tumors are characterized
by very frequent k-Ras mutations and therefore provided an ideal
model to test a requirement for Siah in Ras-driven cancer. Schmidt

and coworkers (30) showed that dominant-negative and shRNA inhibition of Siah potently impaired the growth of xenografts of human
pancreatic tumor cells in mice. Erk phosphorylation (activation) was
reduced, suggesting that Siah may be acting through the Ras/Mek/
Erk pathway in these cells. Shown in a separate study, Siah2 causes
the targeted degradation of Sprouty2 (31), a negative regulator of Ras
signaling, providing a potential mechanism by which loss of Siah
could impair Ras function. Siah expression is up-regulated in all
major types of lung cancer compared with normal tissue (32). Again,
use of a dominant negative Siah protein reduced lung cancer cell
growth. Inhibition or knockdown of Siah2 reduced Erk signaling
and cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced colony formation in soft agar, and reduced tumorigenesis of A549 human lung
cancer cells when injected into athymic nude mice (32).

Siah as a Therapeutic Target
Given the involvement of Siah proteins in hypoxia, estrogen, and
Ras signaling, blocking Siah function could be an attractive approach to impairing angiogenesis and proliferation. Interfering
with Hif-1 up-regulation through Siah inhibition is appealing, as
it may more broadly impact on the tumor's adaptive responses
to hypoxia than inhibition of individual downstream Hif-1 effectors, such as VEGF.
Proof-of-concept for small molecule inhibition of Siah has been
obtained with a short protein fragment that binds competitively
with high affinity to the substrate binding site of Siah proteins,
and resulted in reduced growth of breast cancers (14) and reduced frequency of metastases in melanoma (33). In the breast
cancer model (14), Siah seemed to be functioning, at least in part,
by inhibition of the hypoxic-response pathway, as work with the
isolated cells showed reduced induction of HIF-1α target genes
and tumors displayed reduced angiogenesis. Importantly, whereas
blockade of substrate binding inhibited HIF-1 responses, use of a
dominant negative Siah protein also influenced Ras signaling (33),
suggesting that different parts of the protein may need to be inhibited to fully modulate Siah function.
The above studies highlight three methods of Siah inhibition,
with some different biological effects. The main options for Siah
inhibition seem to be disruption of protein-protein interactions
(between Siah and substrate or E2), disruption of RING domain
integrity (inhibiting Siah/E2 interaction), or inhibition of gene ex-

pression. Siah proteins have been shown to have two important
functional domains, an E2-binding RING domain and a C-terminal
substrate-binding domain (34), though some substrate interactions
map to or near the RING domain (31, 35). The relative specificity of
inhibitor compounds targeted to each of these regions remains to
be determined. Siah1 and Siah2 are highly homologous in the SBD
but vary in the N-terminus/RING domain. Inhibitors directed to
the SBD may be specific for Siahs, but inhibit both Siah1 and Siah2,
whereas inhibitors targeted to the N-terminus/RING may offer
Siah1/Siah2 selectivity, but have the potential to also inhibit other
RING-containing ubiquitin ligases.

Summary
Recent work indicates that Siah proteins are promising novel
therapeutic targets in cancer. Siah proteins are involved in several
signaling pathways, including Ras, hypoxia, estrogen, DNA damage,
and others, and inhibition of Siah proteins seems to slow cancer
growth and/or reduce metastatic spread. The data in tumor models so far focus on inhibition or loss of Siah proteins in cancer cells
only. It is still not clear what the effects of inhibition of Siah proteins in the whole adult animal will be. The double knockout
mouse (Siah1a and Siah2) dies at birth for unknown reasons,
though the role of Siah in response to changes in oxygen tension
may be important. There is need for a better understanding of the
differences between Siah1 and Siah2 functions. For many of the
Siah substrates studied, both Siah1 and Siah2 can function similarly, though usually work focusing on only one form is reported. The
role of Siah proteins as tumor suppressors is at odds with more
recent data, although it should not be ignored. The impact of targeting various parts of the Siah proteins on different signaling
pathways also deserves attention in the drive to develop small molecule inhibitors of this protein family.
