Abstract
Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) are an emerging drug class
that uses antibodies to improve cytotoxic drug targeting for
cancer treatment. ADCs in current clinical trials achieve a
compromise between potency and physicochemical/pharmacokinetic properties by conjugating potent cytotoxins directly
to an antibody at a 4:1 or less stoichiometric ratio. Herein, we
report a novel, polyacetal polymer-based platform for creating
ADC that use poly-1-hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethylformal (PHF), also known as Fleximer. The high hydrophilicity
and polyvalency properties of the Fleximer polymer can be used
to produce ADC with high drug loading without compromising

physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Using trastuzumab and a vinca drug derivative to demonstrate the utility
of this platform, a novel Fleximer-based ADC was prepared and
characterized in vivo. The ADC prepared had a vinca-antibody
ratio of 20:1. It exhibited a high antigen-binding afﬁnity, an
excellent pharmacokinetic proﬁle and antigen-dependent efﬁcacy, and tumor accumulation in multiple tumor xenograft
models. Our ﬁndings illustrate the robust utility of the Fleximer
platform as a highly differentiated alternative to the conjugation platforms used to create ADC currently in clinical development. Cancer Res; 75(16); 3365–72. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

doxorubicin (6), and methotrexate (7). However, these ADCs met
with limited success in the clinic where the therapeutic index was
poor and high doses were often required to demonstrate antitumor activity (6, 7).
With the aim of improving the efﬁcacy of ADCs, secondgeneration approaches increased potency by replacing clinically
validated drugs, such as vinblastine and doxorubicin, with auristatin or maytansine derivatives, cytotoxic agents that are 100- to
1,000-fold more toxic in vitro (4, 8). Extensive work by scientists at
Seattle Genetics (9, 10) and ImmunoGen (11) demonstrated the
viability of these more potent cytotoxins as ADC payloads, and
studies on the stoichiometry of drug loading revealed that the in
vitro potency of ADCs is dependent on the drug to antibody ratio
(DAR; ref. 9). Although a higher DAR is associated with increased
in vitro potency, it also has detrimental effects on the properties of
ADCs. Increased drug content negatively affects the pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC (9), and because drug payloads are
highly hydrophobic, an increase in DAR yields ADCs that are
prone to aggregation (12). Ultimately, a compromise between
potency and in vivo properties was reached with an average DAR
of 4, which provided the best antitumor activity (8, 9).
Herein, we describe a novel polyacetal polymer-based ADC
platform using poly-1-hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethylformal (PHF), also known as Fleximer. The high hydrophilicity
and polyvalency properties of the Fleximer polymer can be used to
overcome the limitations of direct drug–antibody conjugation,
permitting high drug loading with a variety of payloads without
compromising the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC. Typical direct drug–antibody conjugated ADCs
contain 3 to 4 highly potent cytotoxins/mAb. In this report, we
demonstrate the efﬁcacy of a Fleximer-based ADC that uses

Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) represent a unique and
emerging drug class that relies on monoclonal antibody (mAb)
recognition of speciﬁc cancer-associated antigens for targeted
delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. mAb-directed drug delivery
can provide signiﬁcant advantages over traditional chemotherapy, which often yields systemic toxicities, and unconjugated mAb
therapy, which often suffers from limited clinical efﬁcacy (1). The
recent success of two FDA-approved ADCs, brentuximab vedotin
(2) and trastuzumab emtansine (3), has established the clinical
effectiveness of this drug class. ADCs have yet to reach their full
potential as anticancer therapeutics, and active research on the
design of efﬁcacious and well-tolerated ADCs continues to provide insight into the choice of target antigen, ADC stability and
pharmacokinetics (PK), linker chemistries, methods of conjugation, and choice of drug payload (1, 4).
Early approaches to ADC design logically centered on the use of
clinically validated chemotherapeutic agents as payloads for
attachment to mAbs. These ﬁrst-generation ADCs exhibited preclinical promise using established drugs, such as vinblastine (5),

trastuzumab as the targeting moiety and a modestly potent vinca
derivative as the cytotoxic payload. An ester-based linker is used to
conjugate the vinca payload to the polymer backbone, which in
turn is conjugated to the antibody via hinge-region cysteine
residues. The resultant Fleximer-based ADC is observed to be
highly stable in circulation, and it is presumed that, upon antigen
binding and internalization, processing of the ADC to release free
vinca can occur by a combination of processes, including catabolism of the antibody (13), pH-dependent hydrolysis of the
polyacetal polymer backbone (14), and carboxyesterase cleavage
of the linker ester bond (15). This novel ADC, with a DAR of 20,
maintains excellent physicochemical properties and demonstrates sub-nanomolar potency in vitro and target-dependent
accumulation and efﬁcacy in in vivo models of human breast and
gastric cancers.

Materials and Methods
Monoclonal antibodies
Trastuzumab (herceptin) and rituximab were purchased from
Myoderm.
Preparation of Fleximer ADCs
Fleximer ADCs were prepared by conjugation of IgG1 mAbs
(trastuzumab or rituximab) to the Fleximer vinca conjugate
according to the following procedures.
N-(3-hydroxypropyl)vindesine (HPV, I). HPV (free vinca) was
prepared from vinblastine sulfate as previously described (16).
HPV was isolated as a triﬂuoroacetate salt with >95% purity using
HPLC.
N-(3-hydroxypropyl)vindesine alanine (HPV-Ala-NH2, II). See
Supplementary Fig. S1 for schematic of HPV-Ala-NH2 synthesis. Boc-L-alanine (0.681 g, 3.60 mmol) and N,N0 -diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC; 0.561 mL, 3.60 mmol) were combined in
dichloromethane (DCM; 15 mL) at 0 C and stirred for 15
minutes. In a separate ﬂask, HPV (1.462 g, 1.800 mmol) and
4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP; 0.660 g, 5.40 mmol)
were dissolved in DCM (15 mL) at 0 C. The reagent solutions
were combined and stirred at 0 C for 1 hour, brought to room
temperature and stirred for an additional 2 hours. The resulting
solution was diluted with DCM (50 mL), washed with water,
and extracted (2x) with aqueous citric acid (1% w/v). The
combined citric acid washes were treated with solid sodium
bicarbonate, extracted with DCM, dried over sodium sulfate,
and vacuum concentrated. Crude HPV-Boc-alanine (1.4 g) was
dissolved in DCM (55 mL) and treated with triﬂuoroacetic acid
(TFA; 5.5 mL) at 0 C for 1 hour. Following solvent evaporation,
the crude product was dissolved in DMSO and puriﬁed by
preparative reversed-phase HPLC. Lyophilization of productcontaining fractions yielded HPV-Ala-NH2 triﬂuoroacetate salt
as an off-white amorphous solid [59% yield; HPLC purity 96%;
MS (ESIþ) m/z: 883.4 (Mþ1)]. 1H-NMR was consistent with
the expected structure.
See Fig. 1 for schematic of the multistep synthesis of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca (PHF-GA-(Ala-HPV) trastuzumab).
Poly-1-hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethyl-formal (III). The
Fleximer polymer backbone, PHF, was prepared as previously
described (14, 17, 18).

3366 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

PHF-glutaric acid (PHF-GA, IV). 4-N,N-Dimethylaminopyridine
(0.268 g, 2.91 mmol) and glutaric anhydride (1.375 g, 12.06
mmol) were added to a solution of PHF (MW 10 kDa; 1.48 g,
10.96 mmol PHF structural unit) in dimethylacetamide (DMA;
300 mL) and anhydrous pyridine (33.3 mL). The reaction mixture
was stirred at 60 C for 18 hours. Solvents were removed under
reduced pressure and the resulting thick oil was dissolved in water
(100 mL). The pH was adjusted to 6.0 to 6.5 with 5N NaOH. The
resulting clear solution was diluted to 200 mL with water, ﬁltered
through a 0.2-mm ﬁlter, and puriﬁed by diaﬁltration using a
membrane ﬁlter (3-kDa MWCO). Water was removed by lyophilization yielding PHF-GA as a white solid (1.28 g; 48% yield).
Twenty-ﬁve percent of total PHF monomer units were substituted
with glutaric acid, as determined by 1H-NMR. 1H-NMR (D2O):
4.85 ppm (m, 1H, acetal, PHF); 4.4–3.5 ppm (mm, 7H, methylene and methyne protons, PHF); 2.5 ppm (bt, 2H, a-methylene
protons, GA); 2.35 ppm (bt, 2H, g-methylene, GA); and 1.9 ppm
(bt, 2H, b-methylene protons, GA).
Pyridyl disulﬁde (SSPy)-modiﬁed PHF-GA (PHF-GA-SSPy, V).
PHF-GA (1.63 g, 11.12 mmol) was dissolved in water (10 mL)
and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS; 0.154 g, 1.33 mmol) was
added. The mixture was cooled to 0 C and an aqueous solution
of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; 0.256 g, 1.33 mmol) was added, followed by 2(pyridine-2-yldisulfanyl)ethaneamine hydrochloride (0.297 g,
1.33 mmol). The pH was adjusted to 5.5–6.0 and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. PHF-GA-SSPy was
puriﬁed by diaﬁltration and lyophilized to a white solid (1.66 g;
86% yield). The SSPy group content was 3% mol relative to PHF
monomer units, as determined by spectrophotometry. 1H-NMR
(D2O): 8.45 ppm (bs, 1H, Ar, Py); 7.9 ppm (bs, 2H, Ar, Py); 7.35
ppm (bs, 1H, Ar, Py); 4.9 ppm (m, 1H, acetal, PHF); 4.4–3.6 ppm
(m, 7H, methylene and methyne protons, PHF); 3.3–2.8 ppm (m,
4H, methylene protons, cysteamine linker); 2.5 ppm (bt, 2H,
a-methylene protons, GA); 2.3 ppm (bt, 2H, g-methylene, GA);
2.0–1.9 ppm (bt, 2H, b-methylene protons, GA).
PHF-GA-(SH)-(Ala-HPV; PHF-vinca, VI). PHF-GA-SSPy (289.0
mg, 0.023 mmol) was dissolved in water (8 mL) and acetonitrile
(4 mL) and cooled to 0 C. NHS (26.4 mg, 0.230 mmol) was
added, followed by an aqueous solution of EDC (44.0 mg, 0.230
mmol) and HPV-Ala-NH2 (131.45 mg, 0.138 mmol). The pH of
the resulting mixture was adjusted to 6.0, and the solution was
stirred at room temperature overnight. The pH was adjusted to 7.5
with 1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate, and dithiothreitol (DTT; 37.8
mg, 0.245 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for
30 minutes, diluted to 15 mL with water, and PHF-vinca (Fleximer
vinca conjugate) was puriﬁed by diaﬁltration (57% yield, HPVbased). The HPV content was 7.3% wt, as determined by spectrophotometry. 1H-NMR (D2O): Product spectrum showed characteristic signals of aromatic protons of HPV at 7.65, 7.45, 7.20,
6.6, 6.45, 6.0, and 5.8 ppm; signals of HPV methyl and methylene
protons at 0.8–1.8 ppm; and signals of PHF-GA at 1.9–4.8 ppm.
Trastuzumab-MCC (VII). Trastuzumab (10 mg) was diluted in
PBS pH 7.0 (1 mL), and then a solution of succinimidyl-4-(Nmaleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) in DMSO
(5 mL, 30 mg/mL) was added. The resulting solution was stirred at
room temperature for 2 hours. Trastuzumab-MCC was puriﬁed by
gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with PBS

The DAR was 20, as determined by spectrophotometry (the
extinction coefﬁcients for HPV at 280 nm and 310 nm are
17,640 per mol/cm and 7,259 per mol/cm, respectively). The
MW of the ADC was approximately 170 kDa, as determined by
SEC relative to protein standards.

mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.2 mg/mL
BSA, pH 7.4). Recombinant human Her2 protein was immobilized in ﬂow channels using standard amine-coupling chemistry
to densities of 420 and 1,320 response units. Binding studies were
performed at 25 C. Trastuzumab–PHF–vinca samples were tested
in a 3-fold dilution series starting at 27 nmol/L. Each concentration series was injected across the Her2 surfaces at 50 mL/minute
for 8 minutes and dissociation was monitored for 1 hour. Surfaces
were regenerated with three 30-second injections of 30 mmol/L
H3PO4. The corresponding sensorgrams are provided in Supplementary Fig. S2 and S3.

Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, SK-BR-3, and MCF7)
and the human gastric cancer cell line (NCI-N87) were purchased
from the ATCC. Cell lines were used without further authentication. NCI-N87 cells were cultured according to recommended
speciﬁcations; BT-474, SK-BR-3, and MCF7 cells were cultured in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained in a humidiﬁed
incubator at 37 C, 5% CO2.

binding afﬁnity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca to antigen in direct
comparison with that of trastuzumab under identical conditions
over the same surface. Binding studies were performed by Xtal

concentrations and incubated continuously for 72 hours. IC50
values are expressed as nmol/L HPV equivalents.
In vivo xenograft models
In vivo studies using female 9 to 10-week-old CB.17 SCID mice
were conducted at Charles River Laboratories (Piedmont Research
Center) in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. To establish tumors, 1  107 NCI-N87 cells in 50%
Matrigel or 1 mm3 BT-474 tumor fragments were implanted s.c.
into the ﬂank of each mouse. Tumor size was measured using
calipers and tumor volume (l  w2/2) was determined, where l
(mm) is the longest and w (mm) the shortest dimension of the
tumor. Tumors were allowed to grow to a target range of 100 to
150 mm3 before treatment was initiated. Mice received i.v. bolus
injections of ADCs once a week for 3 weeks; a special treatment
group received a single dose of ADCs. Mice injected with saline
were used as vehicle control. To assess the effect of trastuzumab–
PHF–vinca on large, well-established tumors, BT-474 xenografts
were allowed to grow to a volume of about 350 mm3 before
treatment. Time-to-endpoint (TTE) was calculated for each
mouse, and treatment response was determined from the percentage of tumor growth delay (TGD), deﬁned as the percentage
increase in the median TTE in treated mice versus the designated
untreated controls. Body weight and other toxicity symptoms
were monitored. Mice were sacriﬁced when tumor volume
exceeded 700 mm3 (NCI-N87 model) and either 800 or 1,000
mm3 (BT-474 model).
Statistical analysis
For in vivo xenograft experiments, statistical analysis was performed by the log-rank and Mann–Whitney tests using Prism
v3.03 (GraphPad Software).
Plasma pharmacokinetics
NCI-N87 tumor-bearing SCID mice were used for plasma
pharmacokinetic studies. Mice received i.v. bolus injections of
test compounds. Plasma samples were collected at 5 minutes and
24, 48, 72, and 168 hours (n ¼ 3). Conjugated and free HPV were
quantiﬁed by qualiﬁed LC/MS-MS assays following methods
previously described (19). Total trastuzumab was quantiﬁed
using a human IgG ELISA (Innovative Research) following the
manufacturer's instructions. PK was examined by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin v5.2.1 (Pharsight
Corporation).
Determination of total HPV in tumor tissue
BT-474 tumor-bearing SCID mice were used for tumor accumulation studies. Mice received i.v. bolus injections of test compounds. Tumor homogenate samples were analyzed using LC/
MS-MS as previously described (19). Brieﬂy, tumor homogenates
were hydrolyzed under basic conditions (pH > 10) and the
released HPV was extracted. The lower limit of quantiﬁcation for
the HPV assay was 20 ng/g.

Results
Antigen binding
To ascertain whether the conjugation of PHF–vinca to random
lysine residues of the antibody had any impact on antigen afﬁnity,
the binding afﬁnity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was compared
with that of trastuzumab alone (Table 1). Because of the possibility of bivalent binding, as well as the limitations of accurately
measuring very slow dissociation rates (koff), the Kd and koff values
are considered apparent values. Under identical conditions, trastuzumab–PHF–vinca retained afﬁnity comparable with the
unconjugated trastuzumab antibody alone.
Cytotoxic activity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca
The in vitro cytotoxicity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was
assessed in Her2-positive and Her2-negative cell lines. Unconjugated PHF–vinca and the small-molecule vinca release product
HPV were examined in parallel as controls (Table 2). All of the cell
lines were susceptible to HPV in the low nanomolar range.
Similarly, all cell lines were susceptible to PHF–vinca, albeit at
approximately 10-fold higher concentrations. In contrast, trastuzumab–PHF–vinca inhibited the growth of the Her2 (3þ) cell
lines with low nanomolar potency and was signiﬁcantly less active
in the Her2 (0–1þ) cell line.
Efﬁcacy of Fleximer ADCs in a xenograft model of human
gastric cancer
The in vivo antitumor activity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was
ﬁrst assessed in the Her2 (3þ) NCI-N87 human gastric cancer
xenograft model, in which the efﬁcacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has been reported (20). As shown in Fig. 2, tumorbearing mice were treated with vehicle (saline control), trastuzumab alone (15.6 mg/kg antibody equivalents), PHF-vinca (1.2
mg/kg HPV equivalents), HPV (1.2 mg/kg), or trastuzumab–
PHF–vinca. Two doses of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca were tested
[15.6 mg/kg antibody equivalents (1.2 mg/kg HPV equivalents)
and 5.2 mg/kg antibody equivalents (0.4 mg/kg HPV equivalents)]. Trastuzumab–PHF–vinca exhibited the greatest efﬁcacy,
with a 100% regression response rate (8 partial regressions and 2
complete regressions) on day 92 and a maximum TGD of 44.0
days (92%) at the 15.6 mg/kg dose. Treatment with 5.2 mg/kg of
trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was also active, resulting in a TGD of
31.8 days (66%). Both dosages had signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt
compared with vehicle (P < 0.001) and produced statistically
signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) that exceeded the
potential therapeutic activity threshold. Trastuzumab alone was
moderately active, providing a TGD of 12.3 days (26%), no
regressions, and signiﬁcant log-rank survival compared with
vehicle (P ¼ 0.024) with day 29 TGI of 67%. Treatment with
either HPV or PHF–vinca did not yield signiﬁcant antitumor
activity. All treatments were well tolerated, with maximum mean
body weight losses within acceptable limits for all groups. Clinical
observations in all groups were unremarkable for potential treatment-related side effects.

The IC50 value was determined by cell viability following 72-hour incubation with the indicated test compounds.

trastuzumab–PHF–vinca (Fig. 5A). The plasma concentration of
total trastuzumab was monitored by ELISA. Conjugated HPV and
free HPV plasma concentrations were monitored by LC/MS-MS.
The plasma concentrations of total trastuzumab and conjugated
HPV showed a biphasic decline after the ﬁrst 5-minute sampling
time point with terminal elimination half-lives of approximately 9
and 3.5 days, respectively. Plasma exposure AUC0-inf to trastuzumab–PHF–vinca ADCs and conjugated HPV was 332 mg day/mL
and 26 mg day/mL, respectively. The concentration of free HPV in
plasma at all time points was lower than the detection limit of the
assay (10 ng/mL), indicating that the plasma HPV concentration
was at least 1,000-fold lower than that of conjugated HPV. PHF–
vinca displayed rapid plasma elimination and was not detectable
beyond the 24-hour time point.
Accumulation of total HPV (conjugated þ free) following a
single dose of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca (1.4 mg/kg HPV equivalents) or rituximab–PHF–vinca (1.4 mg/kg HPV equivalents) was
evaluated in SCID mice bearing BT-474 xenograft tumors (Fig.
5B). Treatment with trastuzumab–PHF–vinca resulted in a 4-fold
greater Cmax and 9-fold greater AUC0-t for total HPV in tumors
relative to treatment with the non-binding control ADC rituximab–PHF–vinca.

Efﬁcacy of Fleximer ADCs in a xenograft model of human breast
cancer
The antitumor activity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was further
evaluated in the Her2 (3þ) BT-474 human breast cancer xenograft
model. Treatment with 7.5 mg/kg antibody equivalents of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca resulted in the maximum possible TGD
with 100% tumor-free survivors on day 60 and day 14 TGI of
100% (Fig. 3). A single dose (20 mg/kg antibody equivalents) of
this Fleximer ADC also produced the maximum TGD and 100%
tumor-free survivors on day 60. In contrast, the non-binding
control treatment, rituximab–PHF–vinca, produced only modest
TGI with no partial or complete regressions. Trastuzumab alone
was inactive, and trastuzumab in combination with unconjugated
PHF–vinca resulted in very modest activity. All treatments were
acceptably tolerated.
To assess the effect of tumor burden in this model as well as the
efﬁcacy of lower doses, a subsequent study was performed (Fig. 4).
Dosing was initiated either when tumors reached a target range of
100 to 150 mm3 or after tumors reached an average size of 344
mm3 (individual tumor volumes ranged from 196 to 658 mm3).
Irrespective of initial tumor size, all trastuzumab–PHF–vinca dose
groups resulted in a median TTE of 87 days, corresponding to the
maximum achievable TGD (59.4 days, 215%), and 100% tumorfree survivors at the end of the study. At the completion of the
study, the sites of tumor implantation in the higher tumor burden
groups were excised, ﬁxed in 10% formalin, embedded in parafﬁn, and sectioned. Hematoxlyin and eosin staining revealed that
small nodules in the subcutis had amorphous debris and extensive mineral deposits, some scar tissue, but no residual tumor cells
(data not shown), establishing that all of the animals were tumor
free.

Discussion
The underlying concept of an ADC is both simple and elegant:
To use the inherent speciﬁcity of an antibody to a tumor-associated antigen to selectively deliver a therapeutic payload to kill the
tumor while sparing healthy tissues. One of the fundamental
challenges in creating an effective ADC has been to covalently
attach a sufﬁcient number of drug payload molecules to the
antibody to enable efﬁcient accumulation of the drug in the
tumor without signiﬁcantly impairing the physicochemical and
drug-like properties of the antibody. Consequently, the vast
majority of ADCs in clinical development have a DAR of 4 or
less and rely on highly potent cytotoxic molecules (1); there are

only limited examples of ADCs using moderately cytotoxic drugs
(21).
With the polymer approach to ADCs described herein, we
demonstrate that signiﬁcantly higher DARs can be achieved
while maintaining excellent drug-like qualities of the resultant
ADC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a highly potent and
efﬁcacious ADC can be constructed using a moderately potent
vinca derivative as the payload drug (low nanomolar potency
compared with the sub-nanomolar potency of maytansines and
auristatins).
For an ADC to selectively deliver drug to a tumor it must bind to
its intended target, and it was unclear a priori whether the conjugation of PHF polymers to the antibody would negatively affect
this essential property. As evidenced by antigen afﬁnity measurements, trastuzumab–PHF–vinca ADCs with a DAR of 20 maintain
excellent afﬁnity for the Her2 antigen (Table 1). Furthermore,
target-dependent cytotoxicity, a key ADC attribute, was maintained, as shown by the 10- to 75-fold lower potency of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca ADCs in the Her2 (0–1þ) MCF7 cells relative
to the Her2 (3þ) cell lines (Table 2).

In contrast with potency in vitro, the efﬁcacy of an ADC in vivo
may also be inﬂuenced by a number of properties, including PK,
tumor penetration, tumor accumulation, and duration of exposure. To this end, we characterized the properties of the trastuzumab–PHF–vinca ADC in two distinct Her2 (3þ) xenograft
models. In the NCI-N87 gastric tumor xenograft (Fig. 2), the
trastuzumab–PHF–vinca ADC exhibits dose-dependent efﬁcacy,
with a 100% regression response rate (8 partial regressions and 2
complete regressions) and a maximum TGD of 44.0 days (92%) at
the 15.6 mg/kg dose. Treatment with 5.2 mg/kg of trastuzumab–
PHF–vinca was also active, resulting in a TGD of 31.8 days (66%).
Treatment with trastuzumab alone was only modestly active at an
equivalent dose, providing a TGD of 12.3 days (26%) and no
regressions; thus, demonstrating the beneﬁt of HPV conjugation
to the antibody. Treatment with either HPV alone or PHF-vinca
did not yield signiﬁcant antitumor activity, further conﬁrming the
beneﬁt of antibody conjugation.
It has been previously demonstrated that direct drug–antibody
conjugation approaches yield an exposure in vivo (AUC) that is
inversely proportional to drug loading (9). Our polymer-based

Plasma PK of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca and tumor accumulation of total HPV
in tumor-bearing mice. A, plasma PK of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca and PHFvinca was determined in SCID mice (n ¼ 3) bearing NCI-N87 xenograft tumors
following a single i.v. injection of 15 mg/kg antibody equivalents or 1.4 mg/kg
HPV equivalents, respectively. B, tumor accumulation of total HPV
(conjugated þ free) was determined in SCID mice (n ¼ 3) bearing BT-474
xenograft tumors following a single i.v. injection of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca
or rituximab–PHF–vinca at 1.4 mg/kg HPV equivalents.

approach takes advantage of the highly hydrophilic nature of the
polymer, which can help to compensate for the increased hydrophobicity associated with higher DARs, thereby potentially
improving the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties
of the ADC. Indeed, the plasma PK of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca
after a single administration to NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice
supports this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 5A, trastuzumab–
PHF–vinca exhibits a favorable plasma PK proﬁle, with terminal
elimination half-lives of approximately 9 and 3.5 days for total
trastuzumab and conjugated HPV, respectively. Furthermore, free
HPV, which could potentially contribute to systemic toxicity, was
undetectable. As anticipated, administration of PHF–vinca without the beneﬁt of antibody conjugation results in a rapid clearance, presumably via renal ﬁltration of this relatively small, highly
hydrophilic molecule.
Trastuzumab–PHF–vinca also exhibited robust, dose-dependent efﬁcacy in the BT-474 breast cancer xenograft model, where

dosing regimens of either 20 mg/kg once daily  1 or 7.5 mg/kg
once a week  3 resulted in the maximum possible TGD and
100% tumor-free survivors at day 60 (Fig. 3). In this experiment,
treatment with trastuzumab alone was inactive, and not surprisingly, when trastuzumab was coadministered with PHF–vinca,
the combination of these two agents without the beneﬁt of
covalent conjugation resulted in only very modest activity. To
further support that the efﬁcacy of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca is due
to antigen-dependent tumor accumulation, the non-binding ADC
rituximab–PHF–vinca was also evaluated and resulted in a modest TGI, with no partial or complete regressions.
In a second BT-474 xenograft study, the activity of trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was conﬁrmed at even lower doses; dosing
regimens of 3.5 mg/kg once a week  3 or 10 mg/kg once  1
resulted in 10 of 10 tumor-free survivors on the ﬁnal day of the
study (day 87; Fig. 4). To assess the effect of tumor burden,
treatment in one group of animals was delayed until average
tumor volumes reached 344 mm3. Despite the signiﬁcantly
increased initial tumor burden, trastuzumab–PHF–vinca was
highly efﬁcacious, exhibiting a 100% regression rate, with all
animals conﬁrmed tumor free by histopathology at the end of
the study.
The time-course study comparing total HPV drug accumulation
in tumors after administration of either the antigen-binding ADC
trastuzumab–PHF–vinca or the non-binding ADC rituximab–
PHF–vinca further substantiates the beneﬁt of antigen-dependent
tumor targeting (Fig. 5B). Consistent with Her2 antigen targeting,
trastuzumab–PHF–vinca yielded a 4-fold greater Cmax and 9-fold
greater AUC0-t for total HPV in tumors relative to the non-binding
ADC.
In summary, our polymer-based approach to ADCs offers a
highly differentiated alternative to the conjugation platforms
used in the ADCs that are currently in clinical development. The
ability to achieve higher DARs without compromising drug-like
properties, and thereby produce highly efﬁcacious ADCs using
moderately potent drug payloads provides a potential opportunity to expand the scope and utility of ADCs for the treatment of
cancer.
