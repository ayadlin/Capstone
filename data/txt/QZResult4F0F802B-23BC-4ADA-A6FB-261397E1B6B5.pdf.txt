ABSTRACT
PIM kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases involved in cell survival
and proliferation. There is significant structural similarity between the three PIM
kinases (PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3) and only few amino acid differences. Although,
several studies have specifically monitored the role of PIM1 in tumorigenesis, much
less is known about PIM2 and PIM3. Therefore, in this study we have used in vitro
cell culture models and in vivo bone marrow infection/transplantation to assess the
comparative signaling and oncogenic potential of each of the three PIM kinases. All
three PIM kinases were able to protect FL5.12 cells from IL3 withdrawal induced
death. Interestingly, the downstream signaling cascades were indistinguishable
between the three kinases. Transplantation of murine bone marrow co-expressing
MYC and PIM1, PIM2 or PIM3 caused rapid and uniformly lethal myeloid leukemia. Deinduction of MYC 18 days following transplantation significantly increased the survival
of mice, even with continual expression of PIM kinases. Alternatively, mice treated
at the pre-leukemic stage with a PIM kinase inhibitor increased the lifespan of the
mice, even with continual expression of the MYC transgene. These data demonstrate
the role of PIM kinases in driving myeloid leukemia, and as candidate molecules for
therapy against human malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

which are highly evolutionarily conserved in nearly all
multicellular organisms. All three kinases are expressed
in hematopoietic, neuronal, cardiomyocyte, endothelial,
epithelial cell lineages and in embryonic stem cells [2,
4, 7-9]. In humans, PIM1 is located on chromosome 6,
PIM2 on chromosome X and PIM3 on chromosome 22.
Due to lack of obvious regulatory domains, regulation of
their activity is at level of transcription, translation, and
degradation [1, 2, 8, 10, 11]. Studies have also shown that
at the translational level PIM kinases are short lived due to
the presence of AUUUA motifs at the 3’UTR. PIM kinases

The PIM family of proteins are closely related
serine/threonine kinases involved in cell survival,
proliferation and apoptosis [1-3]. PIM1 was originally
identified as a common site of Moloney murine leukemia
proviral insertion [4-6]. Subsequently, numerous
studies have been focused on identifying the role of
PIM1 in driving leukemogenesis. The kinase family is
composed of three members PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3,

are weakly transcribed because of GC-rich motifs in their
5’UTR [6, 8].
Previous studies have shown that PIM1 cooperates
with c-MYC and n-MYC during lymphomagenesis [4,
12]. Moreover, PIM1 collaborates with BCL2, GFI1
and E2A-PBX1 to promote lymphomagenesis [2, 4]. In
cells lacking PIM1, activation of PIM2 through proviral
insertion has been documented [13, 14]. Further, in cells
lacking both PIM1 and PIM2 activation of PIM3 was
observed, suggesting compensatory signaling through
any of the three family members [15]. PIM kinases also
mediate cell cycle regulators via phosphorylation such
as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDK1A/B) and
cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A/C) suggesting that PIM
kinases partially share some substrates with other survival
kinase pathways e.g. AKT [5, 9, 10, 16].
Overexpression of PIM kinases was discovered in
human myeloid and T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, but
recently over-expression has been described in numerous
solid tumors (e.g. pancreatic and prostate cancers, nonsmall-cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, gastric
carcinoma, liver carcinoma, liposarcoma etc.) [2, 4,
17]. Dysregulation of these proto-oncogenes in human
cancer is typically not due to gene alterations, mutations
or amplifications, but occurs as a result of regulation at
the transcriptional level. The most common signaling
activation is via NF-kB [9, 18, 19]. Studies have shown
that inhibition of PIM1 using monoclonal antibodies or
small molecule inhibitors can be effective at suppressing
growth of tumor cells [20, 21]. Importantly, mice
lacking PIM kinase family members are viable and
fertile; indicating that potent inhibition of PIM kinases
will provide a tolerable therapeutic window to inhibit
tumorigenesis [15]. More than 100 PIM inhibitors have
been described and some of these inhibitors are currently
in clinical trials. Although most inhibitors are developed
against PIM1, some have been shown to inhibit PIM2 and
PIM3 [22-25]. Inhibitors such as AZD1208 are pan-kinase
inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical trials [8].
Although several studies have monitored specifically
the role of PIM1 in tumorigenesis, less is known about the
role that PIM2 and PIM3 play in driving tumorigenesis. A
comprehensive study comparing the three family members
in vivo has not been previously performed. Therefore in
this study we have examined the role of PIM1, PIM2 and
PIM3 in driving myeloid leukemogenesis in cooperation
with MYC using our mouse model [26]. We show that
aggressive myeloid leukemia develops when any of the
PIM kinases are expressed in mouse bone marrow in
conjunction with MYC. Aggressive leukemia development
requires the continued expression of MYC and the
constitutive activity of PIM. Our data demonstrate the
functional redundancy of each serine/threonine PIM
kinase family member in driving myeloid leukemia and
demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of targeting this family
of kinases in leukemias that contain a high level of PIM

kinase activity.

RESULTS
PIM family kinases are closely related and are
upregulated in human AML
To understand and compare the role of each
PIM member plays in human acute myeloid leukemia,
we describe the similarities between the three family
members, including domain identification, peptide
length, and amino acid sequence (Figure 1). PIM1 is
406 aa, PIM2 is 326 aa, and PIM3 is 370 aa (Figure 1a).
Although the protein length is different, PIM isoforms
contain highly similar kinase domain with high homology
between the PIM family members (Figure 1b). To
illustrate the importance of PIM family members in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), we have performed analysis of
AML patient samples to determine if expression of PIM
family members occurs within the patients. 47 of the 167
leukemic patient samples analyzed from the TCGA dataset
showed increased PIM family gene expression. A heat
map of PIM expression and the corresponding groups is
illustrated which demonstrates a clear distinction between
the active and not active groups (Figure 1c). Further,
survival distribution of patients with PIM kinase active
was decreased compared to patients without similar PIM
expression (Figure 1d), indicating PIM kinase’s ability to
contribute to poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia.

PIM kinases protect cells in vitro
Although each of the three PIM family kinases are
closely related, a careful side-by-side comparison of their
similarities and redundancies have not been performed. To
assess whether each PIM family member can protect cells
from cytokine withdrawal, we performed experiments
using the IL-3 dependent FL5.12 murine cell line. FL5.12
cells were infected with retroviral constructs expressing
individual PIM members and GFP. After 48 hours, IL-3
was withdrawn from the cells for 24 hours to determine
if each PIM family members could maintain survival
in the absence of IL-3. All three PIM kinase positive
cell populations increased at least two-fold after IL-3
withdrawal, suggesting that each PIM isoform protects
cells against IL-3 withdrawal in FL5.12 cells (Figure
2a). Further, we were interested in whether the pan-PIM
Kinase inhibitor AZD1208 could halt the survival of
PIM overexpressing cells after IL-3 withdrawal (Figure
2b). After 24 hours of IL-3 depletion and 1µM AZD1208
treatment, the survival advantage provided by each of
the PIM family members was dramatically decreased,
however to different extents. These data suggest that PIM
kinase activity is required to increase survival in FL5.12

Comparison of in vitro biochemical properties of
PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3

Expression of MYC and PIM1, PIM2, or PIM3
causes rapid and lethal leukemia

Expression of HA tagged PIM1 HA tagged PIM2
or FLAG tagged PIM3 led to increased phosphorylation
of pro-apoptotic BAD and the MAPK family member
JNK (Figure 3a). In this experiment, an increase in
phosphorylated AKT and p-p44/42 was observed. PIM1
and PIM2 have similar half-lives of less than 16 hours
while PIM3 was rapidly degraded by 4 hours (Figure
3b). AZD1208, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, was used
to treat 293T cells that transiently express each PIM
family member to determine the effect that the inhibitor
has on the deactivation of pro-apoptotic BAD. After a 3
hour treatment of AZD1208 phosphorylated BAD was
dramatically decreased (Figure 3c). These data indicate
that AZD1208 inhibits the PIM-induced phosphorylation

To understand the functional redundancy of the
three PIM Family kinases, and to determine if the biologic
similarities in vitro correspond to control of tumorigenesis,
we performed in vivo assays. In animals, all three PIM
kinases (PIM1-3), expressed in combination with MYC,
drastically accelerated myeloid leukemia. Retroviruses
containing the sequence of each of the PIM kinases and a
tetracycline trans-activator (tTA) were used to infect MYC
transgenic bone marrow cells containing a tetracycline
responsive element (TRE) upstream of MYC (Figure 4a).
The infected bone marrow cells were then transplanted into
irradiated FVB mice to express MYC and PIM1, PIM2 or
PIM3 in the absence of tetracycline. Kaplan Meyer curve

(Figure 4d) of the experimental mice indicate a burden of
myeloid leukemia. All PIM family members (PIM1-3), in
combination with MYC, rapidly and lethally accelerated
myeloid leukemia. All mice were euthanized when they
exhibited hind limb paralysis, lethargy or an extremely
distended abdomen. All PIM1 (n=15), PIM2 (n=12), and
PIM3 (n=12) mice succumbed to disease by an average of
25, 42, and 30.5 days, respectfully, whereas 50% of mice
expressing only MYC succumb to disease at 130 days.
These data indicate that the combination of PIM and MYC
accelerate myeloid leukemia in mice. Mice receiving bone
marrow expressing both BCL-xl and MYC were used as a
positive control. This combination is extremely potent and
leads to complete penetrance of lethal myeloid leukemia
by 25 days [27]. Gross analysis of a leukemic mouse post
mortem also indicates a significant leukemic affliction by
the development of an enlarged spleen and liver (Figure
4c). Comparison between a normal FVB spleen and liver
and a PIM1+MYC leukemic spleen and liver stained with
H&E also demonstrated leukemic onset with an increase
in cells stained with hematoxylin (purple) in the leukemic

liver and spleen. To further prove that mice developed
leukemia, we transplanted splenocytes into sub-lethally
irradiated syngeneic recipients. All mice receiving primary
leukemic splenocytes also succumbed to an aggressive
myeloid leukemia (Supplemental figure 1). Thus, PIM
family members accelerate leukemia in cooperation with
MYC in this mouse model.
To determine the type of leukemia that results
from over expression in mice of both PIM1-3 and MYC
expression, flow cytometry was employed with antibodies
against myeloid and T-cell markers. Flow cytometry
analysis of four PIM1/MYC mice and one mouse from
PIM2, PIM3, and BCL-xl cohorts demonstrates only
myeloid cell (GR-1 and CD11b) markers, indicating a
myeloid, not T-cell leukemia (Figure 5). The PIM family
does not alter T-cells and was negative for T-cell markers
CD4 and CD8, suggesting that the PIMs did not induce
a T-cell leukemia in this model system (Figure 6). A
significant population of GR-1/CD11b double positive
cells was found in all PIM family experimental mouse

data are intriguing because it may suggest that in the
absence of MYC expression PIM1 may be slightly more
potent than the other two family members.

Inhibiting MYC at a pre-leukemic stage decreases
the ability of PIM1, PIM2 or PIM3 to cause rapid
leukemia onset

Inhibition of PIM by AZD1208 halts MYC and
PIM synergism in vivo
To determine if PIM activity is required to sustain
leukemogenesis after a MYC/PIM pre-leukemic state, we
treated mice daily with PIM inhibitor AZD1208. Efficacy
of the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 was analyzed
by treatment of 10 mice by oral gavage with the inhibitor
and 10 mice treated daily with the vehicle. Vehicle treated
mice succumbed to myeloid leukemia while inhibitor
treated mice life span increased until treatment stopped
after 20 days. 24 hours after the last AZD1208 treatmenbt
three random inhibitor treated mice were sacrificed to
determine the extent of leukemia after treatment (Figure
8c & d; * or AZD1208+, repectively). Although the spleen
size was drastically different between vehicle and mice
on AZD1208 (Figure 8b & c), the percentage of myeloid
cells in the spleen still suggests a significant burden of
leukemia in the inhibitor treated mice (Figure 8c). In fact,
once AZD1208 treatment was stopped all mice eventually
succumbed to disease and these mice had spleen sizes

To assess the requirement for continued MYC
activity and whether PIM expression is sufficient to
maintain leukemogenesis without the expression of MYC,
we de-induced MYC expression at a pre-leukemic stage
of cancer development in the mice by giving doxycycline
containing feed. Six mice succumbed to disease during
the window of MYC arrest. Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS) analysis data demonstrate that four of the
six mice had a population of CD4 positive cells in the bone
marrow (Figure 7). Furthermore, it is of interest to note
that the majority of mice that succumbed on doxycycline
were expressing PIM1. After 100 days on doxycycline
chow (MYC off), the mice were switched back to normal
feed. Most experimental subjects eventually succumbed to
disease, although in many instances we were not able to
detect aberrant populations of hematopoietic cells in these
animals. All mice were euthanized and analyzed once they
were on normal chow for an additional 100 days. These

comparable to the vehicle treated mice previously
analyzed from the same experiment (Figure 8d). Thus,
although treatment with a PIM kinase inhibitor extends the
life of the mice, it does not appear to cure the leukemia.
Future work will determine if PIM kinase inhibition can be
combined with additional therapeutic regimens to enhance
cell death.

12, 29] but less is known about the role of PIM2 and PIM3
in tumorigenesis. The levels of PIM1 has been shown to
be elevated in human myeloid and T-cell leukemias and
lymphomas but alteration in PIM kinase expression has
also been identified in prostate, liver, bladder, pancreatic,
gastric, head & neck squamous cell carcinoma, oral, and
colorectal in human patients [2, 21, 30]. Our in vivo model
reveals that all PIM kinase family members can cooperate
with MYC to induce myeloid leukemia. Log-rank test of
patients with AML also demonstrate that PIM oncogenes
are highly expressed in approximately 30% of the samples
analyzed, which correlate with poor survival in these
patients (Figure 1). Closer analysis of the expression levels
of individual PIM kinases suggests functional redundancy
of the PIM family, such that there are very few samples
that highly express more than one family member.. This
observation fits quite well with the data present herein
that demonstrates functional redundancy of each family
member in vitro and in vivo. Thus, all three PIM kinases
are equally important as therapeutic targets.

DISCUSSION
In this study, for the first time we demonstrate the
role of all three PIM kinases in driving tumorigenesis in
both tissue culture and animal models. The expression of
PIM kinases has been shown to be upregulated in several
hematological malignancies and solid tumors [1, 2, 28].
Our MYC-driven mouse model shows that all three PIM
members behave similarly in driving tumorigenesis by
accelerating MYC-induced myeloid leukemia. Several
previous studies were focused on the cooperation of MYC
with PIM1 in mouse model in driving tumorigenesis [4,

We also demonstrate the individual oncogenic
potency of PIM kinase family. Inhibiting MYC at a preleukemic state reveals the weaker oncogenic potency of
kinases. These findings further support previous in vitro
reports about the cooperation of PIM with other oncogene
in the development of leukemia [2, 4, 24]. Several mice
succumbed to disease during doxycycline treatment
but did not have leukemic symptoms such as hind limb
paralysis or enlarged spleen or livers. No significant
myeloid cell populations were present, indicating that
these mice did not develop typical myeloid leukemias, as
seen previously. Possible explanations for this could be
that doxycycline chow may not be able to fully inhibit
MYC expression in several tissues, which would leave

a small population of cells still expressing the potent
combination of MYC and PIM. It is also interesting that
several of these mice had significant populations of CD4
and CD8 positive cells in the bone marrow, suggesting a
T-cell disease. However, conclusions remain unclear and
require further investigation.
Previous reports have shown that PIM1
overexpression increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation
in prostate cancer cells [29], increased p38-MAPK
activation by phosphorylation in Basophils [31], and
increased activation of JNK in cardiomyocytes by PIM3
[32]. Here, we have compared, for the first time, all PIM
family members in regards to the expression of these
known MAPK pathway members. Previous reports have

also used the IL-3 dependent FL5.12 cells as a model for
hematopoietic progenitor cells [33]. We used FL5.12 cells
as a model to compare how each PIM member affected
FL5.12 cell survival after IL-3 withdrawal. Data presented
in Figure 2 demonstrate that all three PIM kinases can
protect FL5.12 cells from IL-3 withdrawal. Further, when
cells were treated with AZD1208 and IL-3 was withdrawn
there was a dramatic decrease in the ability of the proteins
to protect the survival of the cells. Interestingly, whereas
AZD1208 completely abrogated the ability of PIM1 to
protect the cells from IL-3 withdrawal, AZD1208 was less
capable of blocking PIM2 and PIM3. In fact, these findings
are consistent with the ability of AZD1208 to differentially
inhibit the kinase activity of each of the family members,
such that it is known that AZD1208 is most potent against
PIM1, slightly less potent against PIM2 and even less
potent against PIM2. Comparison of protein stability by
cycloheximide in PIM1-3 over-expressed 293T cells also
proved valuable information regarding the protein stability
of each PIM member and how this stability plays a role in
leukemogenesis. These in vitro biochemical results show
that all PIM family members activate the same signaling
pathways (MAPK/JAK/STAT) and increase survival in
FL5.12 cells.
Inhibition of PIM kinase with AZD1208, a Pan
PIM kinase inhibitor, results in reduction of spleen size in
mice which was in accordance to previous report showing
decrease in cell proliferation in AML and xenograft mouse
models [34]. It is possible that the reduction in spleen size
may be because of its well documented suppression in
phosphorylation of BAD which resulted in a reduction
of PIM kinase mediated cell survival and shift towards
apoptosis. These data also support the previous in vitro
finding that AZD1208 causes reduction in cell size and cell
number [15, 34] thus activating signaling event mediated
apoptosis. In contrast, withdrawal of AZD1208 after 20
days of treatment results in relapse suggesting the myeloid
cells that have survived are sufficient to recapitulate the
leukemia in the presence of Myc. This result suggests
that AZD1208 efficacy could be improved through
combination therapy with standard chemotherapeutics.
In conclusion, our mouse model shows the
regulation of all three PIM family members in the
development of leukemogenesis with the average
oncogenic latency being dependent upon which PIM
family member is driving the disease. PIM kinases coexpressed with MYC have produced an aggressive
myeloid leukemia in mice and silencing this family will
increase chances of leukemic cells to initiate apoptosis.
These finding underline the significance of PIM kinase
family as a regulator of leukemia and the potential utility
of a drug targeting this enzyme.

AZD1208 Treatments of mice

In vivo experiments were done as described
previously [26, 27, 35]. Briefly, bone marrow was flushed
from untreated donor mice that carried the Tet-O-MYC
transgene. Red blood cells were lysed and viral infections
were then carried out in the presence of polybrene (#TR1003-G, Millipore, Danvers, MA, USA) using retroviral
PIM construct. After infection, cells were immediately
transplanted into the tail vein of lethally irradiated
FVB/n recipients acquired from Taconic (Figure 1d). For
doxycycline treatment, normal mouse chow was swapped
with doxycycline containing chow (#TD.00426, Harlan
Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA) after 18 days of bone
marrow transplantation (Figure 7a). For PIM inhibition,
mice were orally injected with AZD1208, provided by the
Kraft laboratory in collaboration with AstraZeneca, for
20 days (Figure 8a). For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining tissue samples were shipped to Histoserve,
Germantown, MD, USA. All experiments have been
approved with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC # 11090) of University of Louisville.

18 days after injection of cells expressing PIM1
and tTA, mice were randomly divided into two cohorts.
One cohort of mice was treated daily for 20 days with 30
mg/kg of body weight with AZD1208 by oral gavage and
the second cohort was treated daily for 20 days with an
equal volume of vehicle (0.5% Hydroxypropyl methyl
cellulose/0.1% Tween-80). Mice were treated every day
for 20 days.

PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 RNA-Seq (RPKM) data
for AML tumors from the Provisional TCGA dataset
were downloaded from cBioPortal along with the
corresponding clinical data on July 16, 2014. Expression
for each gene was z-transformed across the dataset and
samples with complete survival data used for subsequent
analyses. Samples with a z-score >1 – indicating the
highest expressing samples - for one or more PIM gene
were then identified and classified as ‘PIM Active’ where
the remaining cases were classified as ‘PIM Not Active’.
Heatmaps were generated using z-score data and plotted
using Genesis software [37]. Survival curves were
generated in Prism Graphpad and the Log-rank (MantelCox) use to test for significant with a p<0.01 deemed
