ABSTRACT
Unlike many other human solid tumors, ovarian tumors express many epithelial
markers at a high level for cell growth and local invasion. The phosphoprotein Pinin
plays a key role in epithelial cell identity. We showed that clinical ovarian tumors and
ovarian cancer cell lines express a high level of Pinin when compared with normal
ovarian tissues and immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial cell lines. Pinin colocalized and physically interacted with transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding
proteins, CtBP1 and CtBP2, in the nuclei of cancer cells. Knockdown of Pinin in ovarian
cancer cells resulted in specific reduction of CtBP1 protein expression, cell adhesion,
anchorage-independent growth, and increased drug sensitivity. Whole transcriptomic
comparison of next-generation RNA sequencing data between control ovarian cancer
cell lines and cancer cell lines with respective knockdown of Pinin, CtBP1, and CtBP2
expression also showed reduced expression of CtBP1 mRNA in the Pinin knockdown
cell lines. The Pinin knockdown cell lines shared significant overlap of differentially
expressed genes and RNA splicing aberrations with CtBP1 knockdown and in a lesser
degree with CtBP2 knockdown cancer cells. Hence, Pinin and CtBP are oncotargets that
closely interact with each other to regulate transcription and pre-mRNA alternative
splicing and promote cell adhesion and other epithelial characteristics of ovarian
cancer cells.

lack of disease-specific and effective therapy. Therefore, it
is of paramount importance to understand the underlining
mechanisms by which ovarian pathogenesis and tumor
progression are regulated and to identify clinical targets
for therapeutic development.
Characterization of ovarian tumors and cancer cell
lines has shown that they are highly proliferative and are
more epithelial-like than normal ovarian surface epithelia
and the derived cell lines, which are mesothelial cells in
nature [2–5]. Benign metaplastic ovarian cysts and the
associated ovarian tumor cells [2, 3] express high levels

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate of
all gynecologic malignancies and is the fifth leading
cause of cancer death in females in the United States [1].
The majority of patients with serous epithelial cancer,
the most common epithelial ovarian malignancy, were
usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and had a 5-year
survival rate of less than 25% and a 10-year survival rate
approaching zero [1]. The high death rate is not only due
to the advanced stage of disease at diagnosis but also to the

of E-cadherin [6] and show suppression of tumor growth
factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway [7]. Ectopic expression of
E-cadherin caused mesenchymal-epithelial transition
(MET) in ovarian surface epithelial cells and tumor
formation [8, 9]. Increased cell adhesion mediated by
these epithelial markers is suggested to be important for
the activation of PI3K/AKT [10] and EGFR [11] pathways
for anchorage-independent survival and proliferation, as
well as for the invasion into local tissues via collective
cell movement [12, 13]. We have previously identified
overexpression of transcriptional corepressor protein,
CtBP2, in ovarian cancer and its function in regulating
cell growth and chemoresponse [14, 15], and also shown
that CtBP2 is an oncogene that may play a significant role
in epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 function in sporadic
epithelial ovarian cancer [16]. C-terminal binding protein
(CtBP) was originally identified as a protein that interacts
with the C-terminal region of adenoviral oncoprotein E1A,
which results in the reduced ability of E1A to transform
cells [17, 18]. Mammalian CtBP family members include
CtBP1 and CtBP2 isoforms, which carry diverse functions
in embryogenesis and vertebrate development [19].
CtBP proteins promote cell survival by suppressing the
expression of several pro-apoptotic genes, thus acting
as apoptotic transcriptional regulators [20]. In addition,
CtBPs promote cell survival through the maintenance of
mitotic fidelity [21]. Loss of CtBP expression suppresses
cell proliferation through a combination of apoptosis,
reduction in cell cycle progression, and aberrations in
transit through mitosis [21]. Alpatov et al. reported that
CtBP1 interacts with a 140-kDa nucleoprotein named
Pinin, which relieves CtBP1-mediated repression of
E-cadherin expression [22]. Pinin was originally identified
as an intermediate filament-associating protein in the
desmosome complex [23] and was later found to coexist in the nucleus [24]. Conditional disruption of Pinin
expression in mice [25, 26] and in cell lines [27] resulted
in cellular apoptosis and severe developmental problems.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression
level of Pinin in ovarian tumors and its interactions with
CtBP proteins in ovarian cancer cells. As Pinin has been
implicated in alternative pre-mRNA splicing [28, 29],
we also performed massively parallel paired-end RNA
sequencing to explore the consequences of knocking down
Pinin expression on gene transcription and RNA splicing
variants.

staining for Pinin (Figure 1A). ANOVA and post hoc
analysis (Table 1) showed significant overexpression of
Pinin (p < 0.001) in malignant and borderline tumors
compared to normal ovaries. When the analysis was
performed to evaluate the expression among different
histologic subtypes within the invasive tumor group, the
serous subtype showed relatively higher Pinin expression
than the mucinous subtype (p = 0.003). We also performed
Western blot analysis to evaluate the expression of Pinin
in our panel of immortalized normal human ovarian
surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines and ovarian cancer
cell lines. The results (Figure 1B) showed that Pinin was
overexpressed in ten out of twelve ovarian cancer cell
lines compared with normal HOSE cell lines. Hence,
collectively, the results show that Pinin is overexpressed
in most of the ovarian cancer cells.

Pinin interacts with CtBP proteins in the
nuclei of cancer cells
Pinin has been shown to interact with CtBP1 to
act on E-cadherin promoter [30]. As we previously have
shown that CtBP2 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer
[14], it would be of interest to investigate whether CtBP2
also interacts with Pinin. Fluorescence microscopy of
ovarian cancer cells stained with fluorescently labeled
Pinin and CtBP2 antibodies showed that they were colocalized in the nuclei of the cells (Figure 2A), similar to
the co-localization of CtBP1 with Pinin (data not shown).
Interestingly, immunostaining also showed that whereas
CtBP2 protein was lost in cells undergoing mitosis, Pinin
protein remained in the cytosol of the cells (block arrow in
Figure 2A). To further investigate the interaction between
Pinin and CtBP proteins, co-immunoprecipitation was
performed using CtBP1 and CtBP2 antibodies, respectively,
to immunoprecipitate intracellular CtBP proteins. Western
blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that Pinin
was co-immunoprecipitated with both CtBP proteins
(Figure 2B). Hence, both immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation assays suggest that Pinin physically
associates with both CtBP1 and CtBP2 proteins in the
nuclei of ovarian cancer cells.

SKOV3-IPLuc ovarian cancer cells with
knockdown (KD) of Pinin expression
showed deficiency in cell adhesion and other
transformed phenotypes

RESULTS

To explore the potential function of Pinin in ovarian
cancer, we have established three knockdown SKOV3IPLuc ovarian cancer cell lines employing lentiviral
particles harboring three different Pinin-targeting short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. We compared the
expression of Pinin, CtBP1, and CtBP2 in these three
knockdown cell lines with the control SKOV3-IPLuc cancer
cell line, and a pair of SKOV3-IPLuc ovarian cancer cell

lines with knockdown of CtBP1 and CtBP2 expression,
respectively. The result of the Western blot analysis
(Figure 3A) shows that the three Pinin-KD cell lines
together with both CtBP1-KD and CtBP2-KD cell lines
had significant reduction of Pinin expression. However, a
surprising observation is that the Pinin-KD cell lines also
showed specific downregulation of CtBP1 expression,
without significant changes of CtBP2 expression. Cell
growth study did not reveal any significant growth
hindrance of the Pinin knockdown cell lines. However,
by day 10, all the three Pinin-KD cell lines showed a
drastic reduction of MTT readings as compared with the
control cell line (Figure 3B). We repeated the experiment
together with CtBP1-KD and CtBP2-KD cell lines and
also monitored the cells during the cell growth study
(Supplementary Figure S1). By day 7, when the control
cancer cells were becoming very confluent, all the Pinin
and CtBP1 knockdown cell lines showed, with CtBP2KD cells a lesser degree, excessive detachment from the
culture plates. This phenomenon suggests a reduction of
cell adhesion in the knockdown cancer cells, similar to
what we have reported for the CtBP2-KD cancer cells

[14]. The cell lines were then tested for the ability to attach
on Cell Adhesion strips coated with different extracellular
matrices. The results showed that the Pinin-KD cell lines
adhered more poorly to different extracellular matrices
than the control cells (Figure 3C).
We next tested the cell lines for anchorageindependent growth, a hallmark for transformed cells.
The Pinin-KD cells formed only about 30-40% of the
average number of colonies that the control line formed
in the soft agar assay (Figure 3D). We also investigated
whether the knockdown cells showed any differences
in response to Paclitaxel, a drug used in the standard
treatment regimen of ovarian cancer patients. The result
(Supplementary Figure S2) showed that the Pinin-KD
cell lines exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to the
Paclitaxel treatment. In the meantime, CtBP1-KD and
CtBP2-KD cell lines showed significant cell death only
at very high doses of Paclitaxel, which we have reported
previously [14].
Collectively, our functional studies illustrate the
important function of Pinin in cell adhesion, clonogenicity,
and chemoresponse.

Next-generation RNA sequencing revealed
that Pinin-KD and CtBP-KD cancer cells
showed significant overlap of differential gene
expression and RNA splicing aberrations

significant representation of noncoding RNAs including
microRNAs, antisense RNAs, long intergenic noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)
in Pinin-KD (21.5%), CtBP1-KD (24.5%), and CtBP2-KD
(23.2%) cancer cell. The heatmap for the top 50 upregulated
and top 50 downregulated genes between control and PininKD cells is shown in Figure 4A. A Venn diagram (Figure
4B) was drawn to illustrate the overlapping differentially
expressed genes among the three knockdown groups. There
are 112 differentially expressed genes shared between PininKD and CtBP1-KD cells, and less than half of that number
(50) between Pinin-KD and CtBP2-KD cells. There are 26
genes that are shared by all three groups. The identities and
the quantitative information of these 26 genes are listed
in Table 2. In Table 2, quantitative information of two
interesting genes that are significant only for Pinin-KD and
CtBP1-KD cells but not in CtBP2-KD cells is also presented.
One differentially expressed gene in both Pinin-KD and
CtBP1-KD cells but not in CtBP2-KD cells is CtBP1. This
mRNA finding corroborates the Western blot analysis result
(Figure 3A). The second gene is epithelial splicing regulatory
protein 1 (ESRP1), which has been reported to associate with
Pinin in human corneal epithelial cells [29].

In order to understand the underlying mechanisms by
which Pinin and CtBP regulate the phenotypes of ovarian
cancer cells, gene expression profiling was performed.
Because previous studies have implied that Pinin associates
with RNA splicing factors and is involved in alternative premRNA splicing [28, 29], we therefore have opted for nextgeneration RNA sequencing to determine gene expression
and potential aberrations in alternative mRNA splicing. Ten
total RNA samples, with two separate RNA preparations
for each of the control, CtBP1-KD, CtBP2-KD, PininKD1 and Pinin-KD2 cancer cell lines, were submitted for
cDNA library preparation and massively parallel pairedend multiplex RNA sequencing and analysis as described
in Materials and Methods. Analysis of the RNA sequencing
data at the gene level revealed all the significant differentially
expressed genes between control cells and the three
knockdown groups, which are presented in Supplementary
Table S1. Supplementary Table S1 also highlights a

Characterization of the differentially expressed
genes of the Pinin-KD cells using Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated significant enrichment
of gene sets in pathways for tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNFα) signaling mediated by transcription factor
NFκB, interferon inflammation response, and DNA
repair (Figure  4C and Supplementary Figure S3). The
transcriptome of CtBP1-KD cells shares significant
overlap of gene sets in the enriched pathways for Pinin-KD
cells, suggesting that Pinin and CtBP1 are interacting for
the similar cell function. The transcriptome of CtBP2-KD
cells also had overlapping pathways with Pinin-KD cells.
However, it appears that CtBP2 serves additional functions

in G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle, which are absent
in both Pinin-KD and CtBP1-KD cells (Figure 4C).
In order to investigate the potential effects of gene
knockdown on RNA alternative splicing or alternative
transcription start site (TSS) selection, the RNA data
was analyzed at transcript level. Supplementary Table S2
lists all the significant differentially expressed transcripts
between control cells and the three knockdown groups.
The Venn diagram (Figure 5A) shows that the number of
genes with significant differentially expressed transcripts
shared between Pinin-KD and CtBP1-KD cells (112) is
similar to the number of genes shared between Pinin-KD
and CtBP2-KD cells (98). There are 40 genes that are

listed in Table 3 were significant in all of the three
knockdown groups, and for the genes such as MMP7,
INHBA, and HSPA1A with upregulated transcripts,
these genes were also significantly upregulated at the
gene level (Table 2). For the genes that had significantly
downregulated transcripts, they either had a small number

the genes with a small number of alternatively spliced
transcripts is Secretory Leukocyte Peptidase Inhibitor
(SLPI) (Figure 5B), whose gene product is a well-studied
serum biomarker for ovarian cancer [31, 32]. The examples
for the moderate to large number of alternative isoforms
are FGFRL1 (Supplementary Figure S4) and CtBP1
(Supplementary Figure S5). The significant differentially

therefore contributed to the changes of the total expression
units of the genes in the knockdown groups, as defined
by Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments
mapped (FPKM).
In Table 3, there were also genes such as
AP2M1, GNB2L1, and MGAT4B that had significantly
downregulated isoforms not shared by all the knockdown
groups. As illustrated by MGAT4B in Supplementary
Figure S6, these genes had a very large number of
isoforms, and the significantly altered isoforms were not
the predominantly expressing protein-coding isoforms and
did not affect the total FPKM expression of the genes.
On the other hand, for the gene encoding nucleotidyl
transferase terminal uridylyl transferase 1 (TUT1) that
had the isoform (TUT1-002) with the highest differential
fold-change in the knockdown groups (Table 3), this
isoform and the other isoform that was significantly

upregulated in CtBP1-KD cells, TUT1-007, were also not
the major protein-coding transcript, which was TUT1-201
(Figure 5C). However, isoform TUT1-002 is a noncoding
transcript with intron retention, and isoform TUT1-007
encodes a peptide sequence only for the first 165 amino
acids of the wild-type gene product, which lacks a
PAP/25A-associated domain important for polynucleotide
adenylyltransferase activity. Hence, both of these two
upregulated isoforms appear to be nonfunctional and
would significantly contribute to the increase of the
nonfunctional isoform pool (Figure 5C), which might
negatively affect the function of the gene.

DISCUSSION
One characteristic of ovarian tumors is that they
express many epithelial proteins [2–5]. Ectopic expression

* Genes and expression changes that are not from the same ENST isoforms.
of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, in normal ovarian
surface epithelial cells caused mesenchymal-epithelial
transition (MET) in vitro and tumor formation in a
mouse model [8, 9]. The epithelial phenotype of ovarian
tumors facilitates the activation of PI3K/AKT [10] and
EGFR [11] pathways for tumor growth and survival and
also for the invasion into local tissues via collective cell
movement [12, 13]. Pinin has shown its importance in
maintaining epithelial cell identity. Pinin depletion caused
apoptosis and reduced survival of cells in vitro [27] and
conditional knockout of Pinin caused defects in mouse
corneal epithelial cell differentiation [25] and intestine
morphogenesis [33]. In our study, we showed strong
expression of Pinin in many ovarian tumors and ovarian
cancer cell lines. Knockdown of Pinin expression in
ovarian cancer cells resulted in significant reduction in cell
adhesion, anchorage-independent growth, and increased
sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent Paclitaxel. The
results of the functional studies collectively indicated
that Pinin, resembling other epithelial markers such as
E-cadherin [8, 9], is important in ovarian tumorigenesis
and progression.
Our characterization also indicates that Pinin
interacts with both human CtBP1 and CtBP2 proteins in the
nuclei of ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, we observed
that CtBP2 was absent in the mitotic cells, while Pinin
was still present in the cytosol (Figure  2A). It is likely
that CtBP2 expression is cell cycle-regulated and is related
to its additional function in G2/M checkpoint and spindle
regulation, as suggested by the GSEA analysis of the RNA
sequencing data (Figure 4C). Another finding about the
interaction between Pinin and CtBP proteins is that Pinin
levels were reduced in both CtBP1-KD and CtBP2-KD
cancer cells. In contrary, only CtBP1 expression, not
CtBP2 expression, was declined in the Pinin-KD cells.
This was confirmed in the RNA-sequencing analysis,
which clearly demonstrated that the major proteincoding isoform and the total RNA expression of the gene
were suppressed in the Pinin-KD cells (Supplementary
Figure S5). The mutual suppression of the first gene’s
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression in the second gene’s knockdown cell lines
between Pinin and CtBP1 suggests the existence of a
feedback loop in regulating one another’s expression.
Besides co-localization and mutual regulation of each
other’s expression, the intimate relationship between
Pinin and CtBP1 is also reflected in the larger number of
co-regulated genes (Figure 4B) and overlapping enriched
gene sets (Figure 4C) between Pinin-KD and CtBP1-KD
cell lines than between Pinin-KD and CtBP2-KD cell
lines. The most significant pathways enriched in Pinin-KD
and CtBP1-KD cells include the canonical NFκB signaling
pathway induced by TNFα and interferon response
pathway. It is well known that these two conserved
cytokine pathways are involved in the response of innate
immunity to inflammation caused by physiological and
oxidative stress, while chronic inflammation is protumorigenic and NFκB is constitutively activated in
many types of cancer to upregulate anti-apoptotic genes
[34–36]. In combination with the DNA repair pathway,
the enrichment of the differentially expressed genes in
inflammation pathways might indicate the stress response
of the cancer cells to gene knockdown. These survival
response pathways were also enriched in the CtBP2-KD
cells. However, as stated before, CtBP2 knockdown also
provoked a response to cell cycle perturbation (Figure 4C).
Deregulated RNA metabolic mechanisms, especially
in RNA splicing, are underappreciated in the field of
cancer research. However, there is increasing evidence to
support the notion that deregulations in RNA metabolism
are associated with cancer development and its phenotypes
[37–39]. By examining the global adenosine-to-inosine
RNA editing profiles of 6,236 patients samples from
the Cancer Genome Atlas, Han et al. identified myriad
clinically relevant altered RNA-editing events, many of
which are in the noncoding regions, that can affect cell
viability and drug sensitivity [39]. In a study to look up
subtype-specific differentially spliced genes and splic­
ing isoforms, Eswaran et al. have revealed RNA splic­
ing signatures for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),
non-TNBC, and HER2-positive breast cancer [38]. In
11406

Oncotarget

another breast cancer study to employ a Bayesian model
to characterize hundreds of deregulated alternative
splicing events mediated by the splicing factor SRSF1
that is overexpressed in this cancer type, Ancuzuków
et al. reported the positional effects of SRSF1 binding
on cassette exons on the splicing results [37]. To this
end, Pinin has been implicated in alternative pre-mRNA
splicing [28, 29], and a Pinin loss of function study has
shown the alternative splicing patterns of SRSF1 [27].
In our analysis of the RNA sequencing data for PininKD cancer cells, significant aberrations of RNA processing
were found. Although the RNA sequencing methodology
we used was not intended to look at noncoding RNAs in
ovarian cancer cells, we found significant representation
of poly(A)-tailed noncoding RNAs such as lincRNAs
and pre-miRNAs in the significantly altered gene list
(Table 2). There are also significant changes of splicing
variants in the knockdown groups (Figure 5 and
Supplementary Figures S4 and S6). Given the intimate
interactions between Pinin and CtBP proteins, it is not
surprising that the RNA processing aberrations were also
observed in CtBP1-KD and CtBP2-KD cancer cells. In
order to explore the function of Pinin and CtBP proteins
on RNA alternative splicing, we primarily examined the
significantly altered gene expression and RNA isoforms
in all three knockdown cell lines. For most of the
differentially expressed genes, the altered isoforms are the
predominantly expressing protein-coding transcripts and
their changes affect the ultimate expression of the target
genes, which might reflect the direct effects of Pinin and
CtBP proteins on gene transcription. However, there are
also genes like AP2M1, GNB2L1, and MGAT4B that are
associated with significantly downregulated isoforms, and
some genes such as CD44, CTNND1, and ENAH whose
alternative splicing forms have previously been described
to associate with Pinin defects [29], the common feature
of these genes is that they produce a large number of
splicing variants, and the altered isoforms are not the
predominantly expressing protein-coding transcripts. More
validation studies are required to determine whether these
altered splicing variants are only spurious RNAs or they
have specific meaning on gene function.
Another outcome of this comprehensive analysis of
the whole alternative splicing transcriptomes in Pinin-KD
and CtBP-KD cells is that we identified significant changes
in some genes that have been associated with RNA
processing mechanisms. One gene was ESRP1, which has
been found to be associated with Pinin in a previous study
[29] and whose expression was significantly upregulated
in Pinin-KD and CtBP1-KD cancer cells in the present
study (Table 2). A new RNA-processing gene identified
in this study was TUT1 (Table 3 and Figure 5C). TUT1
is a nucleotidyl transferase that functions as a terminal
uridylyltransferase for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)
such as U6 snRNA [40], and as a poly(A) polymerase
that creates and cleaves the 3’-poly(A) tail of specific
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mRNA [41, 42], and recent studies have shown that TUT1
is a global regulator of miRNA abundance [43, 44] and
regulates cell proliferation and other cell functions. In our
in-silico analysis, we identified interesting overexpressing
isoforms for this gene in the knockdown cell lines, which
either encodes a noncoding transcript with intron retention
(TUT1-002), or an N-terminal coding transcript (TUT1007) that contains the RNA-binding RNA Recognition
Motif (RRM) domain but lacks the PAP/25A-associated
domain important for polynucleotide adenylyltransferase
activity (Figure 5C). As these two RNA isoforms are
the highest significantly expressing isoforms in the
knockdown cancer cell lines (Table 3), it would be of
great interest to determine whether an overexpression of
these nonfunctional transcripts in the transcript pool would
significantly affect gene function and cell phenotype.
In summary, we have shown significant over­
expression of Pinin in ovarian tumors and its function
in cell adhesion, clonogenicity, and drug response. Pinin
is an important regulator in epithelial cell identity. As a
recent article shows the function of CtBP2 in epigenetic
reprogramming of cells for lineage commitment [45] and
the serous subtype expressed a higher level of Pinin than the
mucinous subtype of ovarian tumors in our study (Table 1),
Pinin and CtBP proteins may interact with each other to
regulate proliferation and local invasion of epithelial
ovarian cancer cells and histologic lineage differentiation.
In addition, our whole transcriptomic analysis of Pinin
and CtBP knockdown cancer cells provides the first
comprehensive portrait of significant transcriptional and
splicing variants. It would be of paramount importance to
study the myriad interactions among the RNA processing
or editing proteins such as Pinin, CtBP, ESRP1, SRSF1,
and TUT1, and identify and validate the key altered RNA
isoforms resulted from the interactions and their impacts on
the functions of ovarian cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimens and ovarian cell lines
Archived specimens were obtained from patients
with an IRB approved protocol at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital in Boston. All the surgical specimens were
collected with patient consents. The immortalized normal
human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines and
ovarian cancer cell lines have been described before [46].
They were maintained in medium 199 and MCDB 105
(Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA, USA) (1:1) supplemented
with 10% FCS.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a
panel of 74 archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissues, including 8 normal ovarian tissues and 66 benign,

borderline, and malignant ovarian tumors. Standard xylene
deparaffinization, rehydration with a descending series of
ethanol solutions, antigen retrieval (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA), and blocking of endogenous peroxidases
in 0.3% H2O2 were performed. The mouse anti-Pinin
monoclonal antibody has been described before [22]. 3, 3
–diaminobenzidine (DAB) horseradish peroxidase substrate
kit was used for color development (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). Staining was graded semiquantitatively
by multiplying the proportion of the stained epithelial area
(from 0 for absence to 3 for more than 95% of the total
epithelial area) with the intensity of the stain (from 0 for
negative staining to 3 for strongly positive staining).

Wild-type SKOV3-IPLuc ovarian cancer cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Natick,
MA) and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100. After
blocking with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA), mouse monoclonal antibodies
targeting CtBP1 or CtBP2 proteins (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) and a rabbit antibody targeting Pinin (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) were added and incubated
for 2 hours. Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse
and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were
used to stain Pinin and the CtBP proteins, respectively.
The stained cells were counterstained with DAPI (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Microscopic images were
captured by a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescence microscope
(Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) and analyzed
by the OpenLab Cell Imaging System software (Leica
Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL).
For preparing cell extracts enriched with nuclear
proteins for Co-immunoprecipitation assays, cells were
lysed by undergoing three freeze/thaw cycles in 200μl of
Buffer A (200mM Tris, pH8.0, 0.3M KCl, 5mM MgCl2,
0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10mM mercaptoethanol,
and 0.2mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and on
ice for 30 min. 400μl of Buffer B (same ingredients as
Buffer A except for the absence of KCl) were added
and the mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30
min. Equal amounts of the cell extracts were incubated
overnight with the CtBP1 and CtBP2 antibodies (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and control mouse IgG,
respectively. The immune complex was captured by
protein A/G immobilized on agarose beads (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After extensive
washes, the immune complex proteins were fractionated
by standard SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and analyzed
by Western blot.

Establishment of ovarian cancer cell lines with
respective knockdown (KD) of expression
of Pinin, CtBP1, or CtBP2, and subsequent
functional assays
Mission™ lentiviral gene-targeting and non-target
control lentiviral shRNA constructs were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Natick, MA, USA) and the production
of transduction particles and infection of SKOV3IPLuc ovarian cancer cells were performed according to
manufacturer’s protocol. The CtBP2 knockdown cancer
cell line has been described previously [14]. The TRC
numbers for the knockdown of CtBP1 and Pinin are:
TRCN0000013738 for CtBP1 and TRCN0000072278,
TRCN0000072279, and TRCN0000072280 for Pinin.
Knockdown of gene expression in the resultant cell lines
was confirmed by Western blot analysis.
Cell growth study was performed using methy­
lthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) solution (5 mg/mL in PBS,
Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA). Absorbance at 562 nm
was determined on an ELx800 absorbance microplate
reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Cell adhesion assay was
performed using the cell adhesion strips from Millicoat™
Screen kit ECM205 (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). For
the experiment, 1x104 cells were seeded to the strip wells
and allowed to incubate for 1 hour. Nonadherent cells
were washed away by phosphate buffered saline and the
attached cells were stained using 0.2% crystal violet. The
stain was solubilized in a 50:50 mixture of 0.1M NaH2PO,
pH 4.5 and 50% ethanol and read at 562 nm.
For soft agar colony formation assay, 104 single
cells in medium were mixed with equal volume of prewarmed 0.66% SeaPlaque™ agarose (Lonza, Allendale,
NJ) and poured over a 0.5% agarose layer in wells of a
six-well plate. After about 21 days, cell colonies were
fixed with 10% methanol and 1% acetic acid and stained
with 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA)
and counted using a dissecting microscope. Cellular
sensitivity to Paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA) was
measured by treating the cells to the drugs for 48 hours
and cell survival was estimated using MTT assays. All
the functional assays were performed in triplicates and
repeated twice.

Next-generation RNA sequencing and
data analysis
Total RNA was extracted from the ten ovarian
cancer cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). For cDNA library preparation,
500ng of total RNA with 260/280 OD greater than 1.8
were processed with KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit
from Kapa Biosystems (Wilmington, MA) for mRNA
purification and fragmentation, A-tailing, adapter ligation,
and library amplification. During the adapter ligation
step, 0.6μM NEXTflex™ RNA-Seq Barcode adaptors
with different indexes (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX)
were ligated to the samples to provide unique barcodes
for each of the ten libraries for multiplex sequencing.
The amplified libraries were cleaned up using Agencourt
11408

Oncotarget

AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN)
and eluted in 20μL of 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8. The
quality of the libraries was tested on an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA)
and the concentrations of the libraries were determined
by qPCR using KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa
Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Ten libraries were pooled
together to give a final library concentration of 17.7nM
and a 50-bp paired-end sequencing run was performed on
an Illumina HiSeq-2500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego,
CA) in High-Output mode.
For the bioinformatics, HiSeq FASTQ data together
with QC files were analyzed to ensure that no run-related
problems occurred. Clean, adaptor-trimmed reads were
aligned onto the human genome GRCh38 (accession
GCA_000001405.15) using STAR v2.4.1b [47], a spliced
aligner for RNA-seq reads. Transcriptome assembly
and differential expression testing was performed using
Cufflinks v2.2.1 [48]. Significant genes and transcripts
were identified based on p < 0.05, as described by
Eswaran et al. [49]. GENCODE v21 was used as the
known transcript annotation database. The mask file
for the tRNA, rRNA, and mitochondrial genes were
generated using UCSC Table Browser. Fragments per
kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM)
was employed as the RNA-sequencing expression unit
for different transcript isoforms and for gene expression
comparison. GSEA and Molecular Signature Database
(MSigDB) v5.0 [50] were used for gene set enrichment
analysis and heatmap generation. The GenePattern [51]
module Read_group_trackingToGct v0.15 was used to
convert the sequencing fragment counts of the genes from
the transcriptome assembly into a file format suitable for
input to GSEA. Venn diagrams were drawn using VENNY
v2.0 (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/).

All calculations were performed with MINITAB
statistical software (Minitab, State College, PA) unless
otherwise indicated. ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s
multiple comparisons test was used to determine any
significant differences of immunohistochemistry scores
between groups. For the functional assays, significance
of differences was determined using 2-tailed T-Test,
with P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
