ABSTRACT
CUSP9 treatment protocol for recurrent glioblastoma was published one year ago.
We now present a slight modification, designated CUSP9*. CUSP9* drugs- aprepitant,
artesunate, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib, disulfiram, itraconazole, sertraline,
ritonavir, are all widely approved by regulatory authorities, marketed for non-cancer
indications. Each drug inhibits one or more important growth-enhancing pathways
used by glioblastoma. By blocking survival paths, the aim is to render temozolomide,
the current standard cytotoxic drug used in primary glioblastoma treatment, more
effective. Although esthetically unpleasing to use so many drugs at once, the closely
similar drugs of the original CUSP9 used together have been well-tolerated when
given on a compassionate-use basis in the cases that have come to our attention so
far. We expect similarly good tolerability for CUSP9*. The combined action of this
suite of drugs blocks signaling at, or the activity of, AKT phosphorylation, aldehyde
dehydrogenase, angiotensin converting enzyme, carbonic anhydrase -2,- 9, -12,
cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, cathepsin B, Hedgehog, interleukin-6, 5-lipoxygenase,
matrix metalloproteinase -2 and -9, mammalian target of rapamycin, neurokinin-1,
p-gp efflux pump, thioredoxin reductase, tissue factor, 20 kDa translationally
controlled tumor protein, and vascular endothelial growth factor. We believe that
given the current prognosis after a glioblastoma has recurred, a trial of CUSP9* is
warranted.

INTRODUCTION

word yet on effectiveness. We present here an update on
the rationale and some minor changes to this protocol,
designated CUSP9*.
The basic idea behind CUSP9 treatment was
detailed in the original document [1] and has not changed
for the current CUSP9*. Briefly, given the impasse
we have been in since temozolomide introduction as
standard initial treatment in 2005 [2] we developed a
conceptually new approach. Instead of focusing on finding
new cytotoxic drugs or variations combining traditional
cancer chemotherapeutic drugs we looked at both native
growth-promoting systems and the many escape paths
that are mobilized by glioblastoma cells during exposure
to current cytotoxic drugs like temozolomide. We then

One year ago, we published the original CUSP9
treatment protocol for recurrent glioblastoma [1]. CUSP9,
Comprehensive Undermining of Survival Paths, was an
attempt to block growth facilitating or growth driving
signaling systems that have been identified as active in
glioblastoma. To develop CUSP9 we found nine repositioned (re-purposed), already-marketed drugs that had
evidence supporting their ability to inhibit one or more
of the identified glioblastoma growth and cell survival
pathways [1]. CUSP9 has been well-tolerated in the
patients that have come to our attention who have been
given CUSP9 on a compassionate-use basis. There is no

surveyed the research literature looking for alreadymarketed non-cancer treatment related drugs for which
we have data or evidence that that they might block or
inhibit one of these identified cytotoxicity circumvention
pathways. Using low likelihood of adding to patient side
effect burden, good quality of life (QOL) maintenance,
and good clinical experience with the drug in question as
additional selection criteria, we arrived at nine drugs to
augment temozolomide’s anticancer activity: aprepitant,
artesunate, auranofin, captopril, Cu gluconate, disulfiram,
ketoconazole, nelfinavir, and sertraline [1].
In Fig. 1. the profound effect of the original
CUSP9 drugs without temozolomide can be seen. Deep
cytotoxicity occurs in glioblastoma cell lines at drug
levels expected in vivo. The new, slightly modified
CUSP9* shows even greater cytotoxicity to glioblastoma
cell lines at even lower concentrations. The deep in
vitro cytotoxicity of both CUSP9 and CUSP9* drugs
to glioblastoma cell lines is the subject of a separate
publication.
Since CUSP9 publication, the European Medicines
Agency has delisted ketoconazole, and the manufacturer
of nelfinavir has stopped production. Related drugs
were therefore substituted in CUSP9*, itraconazole
for ketoconazole, ritonavir for nelfinavir. As disulfiram
achieves much of its anticancer effectiveness only after
one of its metabolites chelates copper, we added copper
gluconate to CUSP9. However, disulfiram derivatives
chelate copper already in the stomach [references given
in Table 4.], negating need for exogenous copper. In
CUSP9* therefore, copper gluconate was deleted. In its
stead, celecoxib adds further dimensions to our targeting
of the many “complementary or redundant pathways”
[3] glioblastoma uses to grow and evade our cytotoxicity
attempts. CUSP9* therefore consists of simultaneous
administration of aprepitant, artesunate, auranofin,
captopril, celecoxib, disulfiram, itraconazole, sertraline,
and ritonavir. They are designed to be administered
with low-dose, uninterrupted, daily temozolomide.
Repositioning already-marketed drugs to block survival
and growth paths in glioblastoma remains the watchword.
None of the 22 studies of new cytotoxic drugs, or
cytotoxic drug combinations for recurrent glioblastoma
reporting in 2012 gave meaningful clinical benefit [1].
We now report similarly sad results for the 27 studies
reporting in 2013. Twelve of these 2013 studies are listed
in Table 1. Since entry conditions were different for these
twelve studies no comparative conclusion can or should
be drawn from the differing OS, other than, clearly, no
breakthroughs have been made. Not shown in Table 1 are
15 studies that were stopped early for futility, disastrous
QOL deterioration, or studies where design vagarities
didn’t permit OS determination.
Four additional guiding principles for CUSP9*
formulation remain as for CUSP9:
A. Careful attention to using drugs that have a low
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

likelihood of increasing patient side effect burden, a low
likelihood of interfering with each other, and a research
database allowing reasonable expectation for antiglioblastoma effects.
B. Importance of having a broad, comprehensive
approach, blocking potential as well as actual cytotoxicity
escape paths. We aimed to dismantle every glioblastoma
cell defense mechanism we could identify for which
we had already-marketed inhibitors that also have low
inherent risk by themselves and don’t have predictable
areas of interference with each other. Although designed
to be used with low dose continuous temozolomide 50 mg/
m2/day by mouth, recent research is showing anti-glioma
activity of the CUSP9* drugs even without temozolomide.
This data will be discussed below in the individual drugs’
sections.
C. When one or several growth paths are blocked, a
cell, and particularly a cancer cell, shifts reliance to other
parallel or compensating paths that have not been blocked.
We term this the “Nile Distributary Problem” in that if
one distributary at the delta is blocked, total flow into the
sea remains unaltered. The unblocked distributaries take
up the water that would have flowed through the blocked
distributary as can be imagined from satellite image in
Fig. 2. Representative quotes in Table 2. are from various
authors referring to this phenomenon in cancer growth
using different words to discribe this idea. Hence, need
for a CUSP-type broad-net protocol.
D. Addressing tumor microregional heterogeneity
in time and space, the “multifaceted heterogeneity” of
glioblastoma both between different tumors of similar
H&E histology and within an individual tumor both in
space and over time [3, 4]. A recent study of aggressive
human breast cancers by Costa et al is exemplary of
this phenomenon [5] that applies to glioblastoma. They
demonstrated marked micro-regional heterogeneity
within a single tumor mass with respect to a particular
proteinase, ADAM-23, showing further that ADAM23 positive and ADAM-23 negative subpopulations
had different but mutually supporting functions [5].
Heterotypic environments create growth vigor in that
ADAM-23 negative cells alone are invasion-competent
but proliferation-poor while ADAM-23 positive
subpopulations are proliferation-competent, invasionweak [5]. We look to this phenomenon of mutually
reinforcing subpopulations with spatial and temporal
intratumoral heterogeneity that is also unstable over time
as a primary cause of previous chemotherapy failures.
Although the particular proteinase Costa et al
studied might not be a universal or even an important
feature of malignancies, we believe that the principle is
paradigmatic of cancers. Heterotypic environments within
a tumor, shifting over time and space is of extraordinary
importance to our understanding of malignant growth.
Many researchers have recently come to related
conclusions on this matter, selected examples given in

glioblastoma reporting in 2013. The remaining 15 studies could not be evaluated for OS but none
seemed to show dramatic benefit or evidence that their numbers would be much different from the 12
listed here. It is important not to conclude from the differing OS in this table that one treatment might be
different or better than another. Study entry criteria, previous treatments, and other variables make close
comparisons between these studies impossible. What we can conclude is that OS is short, glioblastoma is
an aggressive disease and better treatments are needed.

Table 2: Intratumoral spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Selected recent quotes on the strand of thinking in oncology
from the last two years, the principles upon which CUSP9* was developed. Words outside of quotation marks are our
addition but we believe in the spirit in which the quoted authors meant their comments. CSC = cancer stem cell; GBM =
glioblastoma
Effective “treatment of recurrent GBM includes combination strategies with agents that target complementary or
redundant pathways” [3].
Writing of a study of renal cell carcinoma...“Gene-expression signatures of good and poor prognosis were detected in
different regions of the same tumor.....[there was] extensive intratumor heterogeneity” [301]
There is “bewildering...heterogeneity” over time following the same tumor and “within individual tumor biopsies [that
are] spatially separated” [302].
Writing of head/neck squamous cell carcinoma “intratumor heterogeneity showed that a single biopsy may not
represent the entire mutational landscape” [303.].
Reviewing plasticity and CSC “non-CSCs can reacquire a CSC phenotype” [304.].
Writing of cancers generally...there are multiple” dynamic interrelationship[s] between intratumoral cell
subpopulations...[that have] clear clinical significance” [305.].
Writing of aggressive breast cancer...“coexistence of tumor cells with different phenotypic traits within a primary
tumor” with “branched ...[bidirectional] ...evolutionary tumor growth” concluding “primary tumors are ecosystems of
evolving clones with different spatial and temporal distributions” that are mutually reinforcing [5].
In offering their data and interpretation on why inhibiting growth factor receptor inhibition has not been effective in
prolonging glioblastoma survival...”growth factor receptor/PI3K/AKT pathway is complex and nonlinear having many
inputs from other pathways (cross covering paths compensating for a particular block), multiple sites of feedback
regulation (both positive and negative), and a large number of downstream effectors “[306] (Our comments in
parentheses.)

Table 2. Hence, we must cast a wide net with CUSP9*,
multi targeting to match glioblastoma heterogeneity in
time and space.
Also related to this aspect of CUSP9*, concordant
in principle and thinking, was the recent COMBAT trial
[6] where 74 children with various advanced, treatmentrefractory cancers were treated with six drugs- lowdose daily temozolomide, etoposide, celecoxib, vitamin
D, fenofibrate and retinoic acid (COMBAT regimen).
Temozolomide and etoposide are traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents. The four ancillary drugs were
designed to, as in CUSP9*, block survival paths. It was
adequately tolerated enough and authors considered that
their study had evidence enough of benefit in this heavily
pretreated population to warrant further study [6].

the absence of any other cytotoxic regimen demonstrating
significantly longer overall survival (OS) [7, 8]. Note
that one of these studies combined temozolomide with
another of the CUSP9* drugs, celecoxib [8]. The authors
noted that the combination “seems to have activity in
recurrent glioblastoma without relevant toxicity” but their
progression-free survival at 6 months was only 43% [8].
Clearly better is needed.
Discussed below are the nine drugs of CUSP9* with
an updated brief review of data on the 6 retained drugs
with a fuller exposition of data on two new substitute
drugs itraconazole and ritonavir and one new drug,
celecoxib. See the original CUSP9 paper [1] for more
detailed drug reviews and discussion of thinking behind
CUSP.
Aprepitant

The CUSP9* drugs

Aprepitant is a 534 Da oral inhibitor of signaling
at neurokinin-1 receptors (NK-1) for which 11 amino
acid, 1.4 kDa Substance P is the natural ligand [9, 10].
Aprepitant is approved by the FDA, EMA, and widely
used as treatment for cancer chemotherapy induced nausea
and vomiting for which it is quite effective [9, 10]. It is
remarkably free of side effects of its own. Since Substance
P signaling at NK-1 is a growth stimulating element in
many cancers [11, 12] aprepitant has been suggested as
a treatment adjunct for these cancers [13, 14], including
glioblastoma [15, 16].
In vitro apoptosis induction by aprepitant and

Table 1. lists several studies on recurrent
glioblastoma that reported in 2013. A summary of the
CUSP9* drugs showing half-life, and several core
rationale(s) for the individual drugs’ inclusion in, and
contribution to, CUSP9* is given in Table 3. Table 4. lists
the CUSP9* drugs, P-450 engagements and their common
side effects.
The choice of low dose continuous temozolomide
[50 mg/m2/day by mouth] was made in view of the low
side effect burden imposed by this regimen along with

CUSP9 compounds without temozolomide (TMZ) or with TMZ alone at the respective concentrations commonly achievable in human
plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (if the latter data were available). Control cells were treated with the corresponding amount of solvent only.
Microphotographs were taken after 7 days of continuous exposure to CUSP9, TMZ, or solvent respectively. While glioblastoma cells
grew rapidly under control conditions, all CUSP9 without TMZ-treated cells had died. In comparison, TMZ conferred a markedly weaker
inhibition of cell growth.

favorable. In short term studies of single agent artesunate
8 mg/kg/day in normals, altered taste and slight decrease
in reticulocyte count were the only side effects noted [33].
Although clearly embryotoxic, and genotoxic [34]
artesunate behaves clinically differently from traditional
cancer chemotoxic agents. Mucositis, nausea, vomiting,
bone marrow suppression, hair follicle synchronization
typical of genotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs are not
features of artesunate.
“If a little force doesn’t work, maybe more force
will”. Another of the principles in designing CUSP9 and
its first revision CUSP9*, has been “ganging up”, hitting
the same system at different points to block, or in the case
of ROS increase, the given target mode of glioma cell
death. Exposure of epithelial ovarian cancer cells to two
of the CUSP drugs, disulfiram and auranofin, increased
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated
cell death to a greater degree than with either alone, as
discussed below in their respective sections [35]. We add
artesunate to increase ROS and cell death even further [3638].
Also built on our ganging up directive was the
combination of artesunate with a fourth CUSP9* drug,
captopril, in order to inhibit neo-angiogenesis to a greater
degree than by treatment with either drug alone [39].
Another area where we use the principle of

growth stimulation by exogenous Substance P can be
demonstrated in other cancers as well [17, 18, 19] but
heroic doses well beyond those used in humans seem to
be required to demonstrate in vivo tumor suppression.
We optimistically interpret this as an example of “Nile
Distributary Problem” where other growth stimulating
pathways takeover for one that is blocked.
Artesunate
Artesunate is a 384 Da phytoderived drug
commonly used worldwide in treatment of malaria [20].
It is one form of the many related drugs derived from the
same plant, collectively termed “artemisinins”. Artesunate
converts rapidly after ingestion to its active metabolite
dihydroartemisinin. Artesunate has inhibitory effects
against, and is used in the treatment of various viruses,
protozoa, helminths and fungi [21, 22]. Artesunate is
particularly active against cytomegalovirus that are
resistant to DNA polymerase inhibitors like valganciclovir
[23, 24]. Artesunate has demonstrated empirical
cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cells [general
review- 22, specific examples: lymphoma and myeloma,
25; pancreatic, 26; hepatocellular, 27; osteosarcoma, 28;
gastric, 29; leukemia, 30, 31; glioma, 32].
In malaria studies artesunate is not given alone so
its side effect profile is difficult to judge but it seem to be

ganging up is autophagy. Artesunate kills plasmodia and
breast cancer cell lines via an autophagic pathway [40].
Artesunate decreased irradiation dose LD50 in LN229
and U87 glioma cell lines [41]. Of central importance
to artesunate’s use in CUSP9*, empirically artesunate
augments temozolomide cytotoxicity in both U87 and
A172 glioma cell lines [32].
Artesunate had good cytotoxicity against a panel
of 91 cancer cell lines at in vitro levels well below the
artesunate levels in patients treated for malaria [42]. In
artesunate mediated plasmodia cytotoxicity, mitochondrial
depolarization mediated by an increase in intracellular
ROS was identified as mode of action [37, 38].
Artesunate lowered expression of thioredoxin and
cytochrome c oxidase mRNA by 95% in schistosomes
of infected mice [43]. A fifth CUSP9* drug auranofin is
also a strong inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, increasing
intracellular ROS as discussed below.

CUSP9* has been modified from the original
CUSP9 to account for a specific reciprocal back-andforth shunting between cyclooxygenase (COX) and
5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). As one is inhibited, the other
tends to become augmented in reciprocal fashion. This is
discussed later in Section 2.6. on celecoxib and in Section
4. on reciprocal 5-LO and COX shunting.
Auranofin inhibited 5-LO in stimulated neutrophils
[60-62] and in stimulated alveolar macrophages [63].
LTB4 is a major pro-inflammatory leukotriene product of
arachidonate metabolism by 5-LO. Activated neutrophils’
migration along an LTB4 gradient is also inhibited by
auranofin [61, 64]. Neutrophil aggregation, degranulation,
chemotaxis toward LBT4 as well as LBT4 synthesis itself
was blocked by auranofin [65-67].
An early study gave evidence of auranofin’s ability
to cause arachidonic acid release from macrophages [63].
This was accompanied by some increase in thromboxane
and prostaglandin E2, PGE2 [63]. Hence, for this reason
also, to limit potential compensatory increase in PGE2, we
add celecoxib to CUSP9* as discussed below.

Auranofin
Auranofin is a 679 Da gold-containing lipophilic
drug first marketed in the 1980’s for treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis [44]. It remains in use worldwide as
one of the so-called DMARDs, disease modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Auranofin and cathepsin B
Cathepsin B is rather prominently upregulated in
glioblastoma [16, 68-70 ] and promotes glioblastoma
growth by contributing to matrix dissolution, Bcl-2
maintenance, and AKT activation [16, 68-70 ]. Cathepsin
B becomes upregulated in a CXCL12 mediated feedback
system with vessel endothelium [71] forming yet another
positive mutually reinforcing feedback system active
in glioblastoma with negative consequences in that
glioblastomas are prodigious synthesizers of CXCL12, a
target of treatment in its own right [72, 73]. A drawback
is that auranofin is only a weak inhibitor of cathepsin B
activity [16, 74]. But it is the only one we’ve got.

Auranofin and thioredoxin reductase
Thioredoxin reductase inhibition results in increased
intracellular ROS. The effects of thioredoxin reductase
inhibition by auranofin, the primary mode of action in
both anti-rheumatoid arthritis and anti-cancer roles [4548], can be significantly augmented by combination
with disulfiram [35], another CUSP9* drug. Auranofin
inhibited interleukin-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation
and nuclear translocation via an increased ROS step
[49]. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells are similarly
preferentially killed by auranofin generated ROS [50].
Like auranofin, other structurally unrelated inhibitors of
thioredoxin reductase are cytotoxic to cancer cell lines by
ROS generation [51-54].
An interesting feedback system [55] reminiscent in
principle to that of Schruefer et al [vide infra, 56] and with
potentially quite important clinical implications has been
delineated since CUSP9 was published. Cell-free medium
from glioma cell cultures stimulated synthesis of inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and consequent increased
NO production in non-malignant microglia in vitro but
without changing these normal microglia’s proliferation
or death rate [55]. This normal microglia produced NO
in turn stimulated co-cultured glioma cells’ migration and
their synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
and macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (synonymous with
CCL2, MCP-1) [55]. MCP-1 has an established growth
promoting and negative prognostic effect in glioblastoma
[57-59].

Captopril
Captopril is 217 Da angiotensin converting
enzyme, ACE, inhibitor [75]. It was the first marketed
pharmaceutical ACE inhibitor and has remained in wide
use since its clinical introduction in the early 1980’s.
Captopril and a dozen other marketed ACE inhibitors are
supported by a robust database on clinical effectiveness
in treating hypertension, chronic heart failure, and as
renoprotection during glomerulonephropathies [76].
Although more convenient once-a-day ACE inhibitors
have since come on the market, we chose to use captopril
because so much of the empirical anti-cancer data was
collected specifically on captopril. Although we probably
have a class effect, we cannot safely assume this.
Captopril as an anti-cancer agent
We include captopril in CUSP9* based on three
not necessarily discrete lines of evidence: a] data
showing that captopril inhibits activity of soluble matrix
8058

Oncotarget

metalloproteinase (MMP) -2 and MMP-9, with a parallel
data set showing these MMPs to be a growth facilitating
factor in glioblastoma growth, b] ACE inhibitors,
including specifically captopril have been shown to inhibit
angiogenesis, both normal and cancer-related, c] empirical
studies showing growth inhibition in cancer models. These
will be reviewed with references below.
As an anti-glioma agent, captopril was first
mentioned in 1995 when exposure in vitro resulted in
diminished invasion, growth and MMP-2/MMP-9 activity
[77]. These results were later replicated [78, 79]. MMP-2
and -9 inhibitory properties of captopril were reviewed in
2012 [80]. Many cancers have been shown to over express
MMP-2, -9. The principle of our use of captopril in
glioblastoma was active in a study of renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), where immunohistochemical evidence for ACE
expression on RCC, was first demonstrated in 1983 and
this ACE activity was inhibited by captopril [81].
Throughout mammalian physiology, we see the
pattern where different organs or organ systems use the
same or similar function-mediating system for different
ends, ends specific and relevant to the differing goals
served by the specific organ or organ system. The reninangiotensin system (RAS) is one such system. While most
commonly thought of in terms of mediating the organ
cross-talk between kidney-liver-lung in regulating sodium
chloride balance and blood pressure, all components of
RAS are endogenously expressed and used within brain
and bone for examples, as semi-autonomous systems.
Semi-autonomous means that both fully autonomous
within bone or brain and elements interacting with
systemic RAS are recognized.
Of special importance to CUSP9*, Carpentier et al
demonstrated a steroid-sparing effect of ACE inhibitors or
the related class of drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers,
ARBs in glioblastoma patients [82]. We discuss their
findings further below, offering the interpretation that
glioblastoma overexpressed ACE functions to enhance
peritumoral edema.
In a clinical study of low dose captopril, 12.5 mg
twice daily, post-resection PSA rises occurred in 3 of
32 prostate cancer patients in the captopril group versus
10 of 30 in the control group [83]. Crucially, follow up
data on OS have not been published. Others are looking
at slowing or stopping cancer growth by blocking growth
factors with repurposed already-approved drugs. In 2004,
Jones et al studied three non-cytotoxic drugs- captopril
50 mg twice daily in combination with marimastat and
subcutaneous fragmin- in patients with various terminal
metastatic cancers [84]. Whether this treatment regimen
slowed disease progress as the authors claimed or not, the
drugs were well-tolerated even in this very sick patient
population [84].
Marginal reduction in prostate cancer (relative risk
was o.7) in those using captopril in hypertension treatment
was seen in an epidemiological study of 23,000 men that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

showed no association- increased or decreased- relative
risk in users of any other antihypertensive drug suggesting
a captopril-specific rather than class-specific effect [85].
In rat prostate cancer, Wilson et al demonstrated captopril
inhibitable ACE expression, conjecturing that ACE
matures multiple growth factors by proteolysis of the
parent peptide [86], a conjecture with which we agree.
Captopril inhibited tumor growth in a murine
colon cancer model [87]. Growth of a human gastric
cancer cell line [88] and a myelogenous leukemia cell
line [89] were inhibited by low dose captopril. ACE and
angiotensin II receptor 1, ATR1 were overexpressed in
19 of 25 resected pancreatic ductal cancers examined by
immunohistochemistry and captopril suppressed their
proliferation in vitro [90]. Captopril inhibited a renal
cell carcinoma cell line’s growth in severe combined
immunodeficient mice without showing in vitro
proliferation inhibition to that cell line at an equivalent
concentration [91].
Estrogen receptor expression and in vitro
proliferation of mammary ductal cell carcinoma cell
lines were inhibited by captopril [92, 93]. After corneal
injury neovascularization at injury site interferes with
vision. Captopril inhibited this destructive post-injury
corneal vascularization that was tractable to diminished
endothelial cell migration at clinical captopril levels <10
micromoles [94]. Building on this observation, Volpert et
al examined effects of captopril on a rat fibrosarcoma cell
line that was resistant to captopril in vitro. Interestingly,
they found in vivo captopril did inhibit this tumor’s
growth, suggesting an effect of stroma/host vasculature
response rather than the malignant clone itself [94].
Captopril lengthened overall survival in mice with
Lewis lung carcinoma and potentiated cyclophosphamide
in this model [95]. Very high doses of captopril [~50 mg/
kg/day] in mice inhibited fibrosarcoma and squamous
cell carcinoma development in irradiated skin [96]. A
xenografted human melanoma cell line’s growth was
inhibited by captopril [97]. However, and instructively,
captopril had no antiproliferative effect on a variety of
other cancer cell lines in vitro [98, 99]. Instructive in that
clinical cancer growth inhibition via ACE inhibition occurs
largely, although not exclusively, through angiogenesis
inhibition, not inherent cytotoxicity.
Captopril inhibited the activity of soluble MMP-2
and MMP-9 secreted by a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line
[100]. Growth in nude mice of this cell line was inhibited
by captopril and inhibited yet further in combination with
cisplatin [100.]. Captopril inhibited a mammary ductal
cell carcinoma cell line in a Cu++ dependent manner, with
indicators this was mediated by increased intracellular
ROS [93]. Captopril inhibited soluble MMP-2 and MMP9 activity from Lewis lung cancer cells in vitro and slowed
growth in a murine model [101]. Moreover, in three triplenegative breast cancer cell lines tested, captopril inhibited
proliferation only in those cells that expressed outer cell

membrane ACE [102]. Importantly for CUSP9*, glioma
cells express ACE-like activity [103].
Growth of murine colon cancer metastases to liver
[104] and a xenografted non-small cell lung cancer cell
line [105] were inhibited by captopril. Of particular
importance and interest to the CUSP9* protocol, another
CUSP9* drug, artesunate, when added to captopril yielded
a synergistic inhibition of angiogenesis in an ovine
allantoic membrane angiogenesis model [39].

uncontrolled and had other variables that didn’t permit
benefit quantitation. Adjuvant celecoxib was generally
well tolerated in these studies.
In an uncontrolled study, children with various
advanced cancers were given cyclophosphamide and
etoposide as cytotoxic chemotherapy augmented with
non-cytotoxic growth factor blocking drugs [thinking
along same lines as CUSP9*] celecoxib, thalidomide,
and fenofibrate [125]. The authors, experienced
pediatric oncologists, considered “Clinical activity
was demonstrated in some but not all tumor strata.”
An uncontrolled study in advanced metastatic breast
cancer of daily cyclophosphamide plus celecoxib 200
mg twice daily “is safe and shows a therapeutic effect in
advanced breast cancer patients” [126 ]. In another study,
a treatment regimen consisting of celecoxib 200 mg twice
daily, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide
followed by docetaxel was reported to be “active and safe
for treatment of operable invasive breast cancer” [127].
In addition, in a study of carboplatin, gemcitabine or
carboplatin with vinorelbine in advanced non-small cell
lung cancer given celecoxib at 400 mg twice daily “The
effect on survival by celecoxib in the whole subset of
patients was positive” [128].
However, there are also negative studies. For
example, a study of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer
treated with docetaxel, carboplatin using adjuvant
celecoxib at 400 mg twice daily showed no survival
benefit from added celecoxib [129]. We refer to the
reciprocal relationship between COX and 5-LO, discussed
in detail with references in section 4. below as explanation
for this failure and how we address this in CUSP9*.

Captopril and tissue factor
Tissue factor (TF, factor III, also termed
thromboplastin), is a 47 kDa outer cell surface receptor
for soluble, activated clotting factor VII [106. ]. The TFfactor VII complex then mediates factor X conversion to
activated factor Xa. TF is commonly elevated in human
glioblastoma [107-110]. TF is yet another of the many
growth facilitating factors we aim to inhibit in CUSP9*.
In a breast cancer cell line, TF activity and TF mRNA
was reduced by about a third by captopril exposure in
vitro [111]. TF subserves other growth enhancing aspects
of glioblastoma growth in addition to contributing to
the excess thrombosis related morbidity associated
with glioblastoma [106, 108, 110, 112-115]. This is so
particularly in the stem cell subpopulation [114, 115].
The dangers of systemic anticoagulation in
glioblastoma are clear [111, 116]. Captopril mediated
down-regulation of glioblastoma cell overexpression of
TF might be an ideal way to deprive glioblastomas of this
growth and migration enhancing system.
Celecoxib
Introduction

Celecoxib and carbonic anhydrase

New to CUSP9* is celecoxib. Celecoxib is a 381
Da cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor commonly and
effectively used to treat pain of diverse origins [117,
118]. It lacks any platelet aggregation inhibitory activity
as seen with some other COX inhibitors [119]. Clinical
and research literature routinely call celecoxib “COX-2
selective” and this is relatively so but to our reading of the
data celecoxib inhibits COX-1 to some degree [120-123
vide infra]. Shortly after clinical introduction to clinical
practice in symptomatic treatment of pain, anti-cancer
effects were noted both empirically and by theoretical
reasoning [124 ]. Celecoxib is now being widely used on
and off cancer treatment protocols in a variety of different
cancers. It has come to our attention that people with
glioblastoma are commonly starting celecoxib on their
own, often without their oncologist’s knowledge.

Carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reaction CO2 and
H2O to H+ and bicarbonate. It has 12 isoforms of which
some are soluble in the cytoplasm [isoform -2], some
transmembraneous [isoforms -9 and -12]. In either case,
the proton is excreted and bicarbonate kept within the cell.
The net effect is further acidification of the extracellular
milieu. Glioblastoma cell carbonic anhydrase thereby
contributes to glioblastoma’s acidic milieu [vide infra].
In 2006, a blind selection of 960 molecules tested for
carbonic anhydrase-2 inhibition revealed that celecoxib
was among the most potent molecules [130].
Glioblastomas, like many other cancers,
express abnormally large amounts of carbonic
anhydrase [131-134]. Stronger carbonic anhydrase-9
immunohistochemical staining of human glioblastoma
biopsies was correlated with shorter overall survival, a
robust finding confirmed by four independent groups
[135-138]. In biopsy specimens of endothelium derived
from glioblatomas, overexpression of carbonic anhydrase
isoform-2 was found and likewise correlated with shorter
survival [135]. Overexpression of carbonic anhydrase is
thought to be an adaptation allowing better survival in

Celecoxib and COX-1, COX-2
Celecoxib is currently in 42 open clinical trials
as adjuvant to traditional cancer cytotoxic or drugs or
treatments [clinicaltrials.gov]. Celecoxib adjuvant trials
reporting recently have not been entirely negative but
neither have they been strongly encouraging. Many were

the hypoxic, acidic environment of tumors [134, 135],
particularly glioblastomas [138]. Although areas of most
intense immunohistochemical staining for carbonic
anhydrase tend to be the most hypoxic, and or necrotic, it
seems that in fact it is extracellular acidosis that triggers
increased expression of carbonic anhydrase [131, 137].
The pan-carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide
was shown to enhance temozolomide cytotoxicity
in a glioma cell line while dexamethasone reduced
temozolomide cytotoxicity in this same model [138].
Writing in 2008 these authors suggested clinical use
of acetazolamide along with temozolomide to reduce
peritumoral edema, enhance temozolomide’s cytotoxicity,
and reduce need for [potentially counter-productive] use of
dexamethasone. We agree and choose celecoxib partly for
its nanomolar inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.

ovarian cancer cells being mediated in part by increased
ROS [35, 149]. Likewise, pancreatic cancer cell growth
inhibition in a murine xenotransplant model was also
ROS dependent [150]. A compound screen including
several thousand drugs showed prostate cancer cells to
be sensitive to disulfiram which was partially reversible
by adding ROS scavenging agents [151] again indicating
that disulfiram-mediated cytotoxicity at least in part is
due to the increased generation of ROS. ROS increase
as a primary mode of disulfiram-mediated cell death was
already indicated in early works with melanoma cells over
ten years ago [152, 153].
In the course of replicating disulfiram’s increased
ROS cytotoxicity to breast and colon cancer cells, and
quite happily for our intended use, hypoxia and lower pH
– conditions prevailing within glioblastoma tissue - both
enhance disulfiram’s cytotoxicity [154]. Disulfiram alone,
but particularly so in combination with auranofin, results
in large increases in intracellular ROS [35].
In a genomic study examining a panel of ovarian
cancer cells ALDH expression as a feature of stemness
was again confirmed suggesting disulfiram as a stemness
defeating drug for that type of cancer [155]. As for other
cancers, the subset of high ALDH expressing cells was
associated with stem cell attributes and disulfiram again,
as predicted, defeated much of the stem cell functions,
both in vitro and in a xenograft model [156]. Breast cancer
cells expressing ALDH were shown to have decreased
sensitivity to paclitaxel and cisplatin compared to ALDH
non-expressing cells. Decreased sensitivity in these ALDH
expressing cells reverses after exposure to disulfiram
[157]. Triple negative breast cancer cells showed synergy
in cytotoxicity when disulfiram is added to doxorubicin
[158]. Gemcitabine cytotoxicity is enhanced by disulfiram
in glioblastoma cells [159], in pancreatic cancer cells [156,
160] and in breast and colon cancer cells [161].
However, disulfiram related cytotoxicity seems to be
exerted by at least two main paths- one Cu++ dependent,
one not [35, 162, 163]. Importantly, for our intended use
cancer cell specific cytotoxicity peaks when disulfiram and
copper are present in a 1:1 molar ratio [162]. By an unclear
mechanism, cytotoxicity is reduced by excess disulfiram
[162]. Data from early 2014 indicate that disulfiram is a
partial inhibitor of the main temozolomide damage repair
enzyme, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase,
MGMT [163].
However, a study of disulfiram 250 mg/day or 500
mg/day as isolated treatment failed to significantly affect
progression in men with localized recurrent post-resection
prostate cancer as measured by PSA slope [164]. We
interpret the discrepancy with in vitro data to mean a]
in human disease there are compensatory paths engaged
when ALDH is inhibited, and b] these compensatory
growth paths must also be blocked simultaneously with
ALDH. Certainly, there are also other interpretations for
the failure of disulfiram to change prostate cancer growth

Disulfiram
Disulfiram is a 297 Da drug, used since the 1950’s
to treat alcoholism by making ethanol ingestion highly
unpleasant [1, 139-142]. As a potent inhibitor of all
isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH, disulfiram
stops ethanol metabolism at the acetaldehyde stage.
Multi-system dysfunction ensues if ethanol is consumed,
as manifest by flushing, hypotension, malaise, nausea,
vomiting. Acetaldehyde is poorly tolerated. ALDH
normally would transform the toxic ethanol metabolite
acetaldehyde into non-toxic acetic acid that is smoothly
handled without problem. Since disulfiram chelates Cu++
in the stomach even without adding exogenous Cu [139],
Cu gluconate of CUSP9 has been deleted in CUSP9*.
In CUSP9 [1] we gave the basic rationale for adding
disulfiram to glioblastoma treatment. Since then the
rationale has been further elaborated and details added [35,
143, 144]. We give here in CUSP9* a short background
and a little update on disulfiram developments since end
of 2012.
The original suggestion to use disulfiram in
treatment of glioblastoma came from dozens of reports
associating high ALDH expression in individual cells with
those cells having stem cell attributes [142, 143]. This held
true in various cancers including glioblastoma [141, 142,
146]. There are currently 30 open studies on disulfiram as
adjuvant treatment in various cancers [clinicaltrials.gov].
Some recent data on disulfiram: Mesothelioma
cells’ growth inhibition by disulfiram/copper was
associated with weaker NFkB activation, accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins and cleavage of vimentin [145 ]. A
study in glioblastoma also showed disulfiram cytotoxicity
was related to inhibition of NFkB activation [146- 148].
Cytotoxicity by disulfiram/copper to non-small cell lung
cancer cells resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M [147].
In hepatocellular cancer disulfiram/copper mediated
cytotoxicity was shown to be mediated through an ROS
increasing step [148], findings concordant with our
findings on disulfiram/copper cytotoxicity to epithelial

which were traditional cancer chemotherapeutic drugs,
Chong et al found itraconazole to be a specific inhibitor
of human umbilical cord endothelial cell proliferation
while surprisingly having little or weak inhibitory effect
on normal fibroblasts, Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells [176].
In support of our substitution of ketoconazole in CUSP9
with itraconazole in CUSP9*, ketoconazole was shown
to provide less anti-angiogenesis activity in this model.
Chong et al’s premise was to “uncover novel biological
activity among existing drugs,” [176] - precisely one of
our main driving principles also in CUSP9*. Another
group showed diminished nascent capillary sprouting as
well as endothelial proliferation inhibition during exposure
to itraconazole [177].
Easily achievable levels of itraconazole will block
vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, binding to
VEGF receptor-2 [178]. This was traced to defective
receptor trafficking, which in turn was secondary to
itraconazole mediated defective glycosylation of VEGF
receptor-2 [178]. Another interesting and helpful aspect of
this trafficking inhibition by itraconazole is its interference
with mTOR activation [179].
mTOR/AKT signaling in glioblastoma cells was
inhibited during exposure to itraconazole with autophagic
cell death to follow [180]. Since “angiogenesis is
dependent on multiple growth factors and a broad
signaling network in vivo” [180] it seems reasonable
that we must block multiple growth factors with multiple
drugs, until and unless we can find a crucial single sine
qua non element in this process. So far, it seems there is
none such. Hence, at least for now, CUSP9*.
The pharmacokinetics of itraconazole oral solution
was measured in seven patients receiving chemotherapy
followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation for
leukaemia or lymphoma. Patients receiving itraconazole
5 mg/kg/day [70 kg = 350 mg/day] gave pre-dose serum
level of ~800 ng/mL at steady state [about two weeks]
[181]. A retrospective analysis of patients with acute
lymphoblastic and acute myelogenous leukemia receiving
daunorubicin where itraconazole was used as antifungal
prophylaxis during the neutropenic nadir showed better
remission rates than those not receiving itraconazole [182].
The effect was not large but was statistically significant.
In vitro, intracellular levels of daunorubicin increased
proportionately as itraconazole levels went from o.5 to
5.0 microg/ml [183].

It still remains a matter of debate whether
disulfiram’s anti-cancer mechanism of action is based on
ALDH inhibition, MGMT inhibition, NFkB activation
inhibition, proteasome inhibition, or increased intracellular
ROS generation. Is one event primary and the others
secondary to that one? Or is stem cell selectivity achieved
by a combination of actions? Answers to these important
questions are currently unknown.
Itraconazole
General
Itraconazole is a 706 Da broad spectrum anti-fungal
agent used clinically since the late 1980’s [165, 166]. It
is commonly used today for onychomycosis and as antifungal prophylaxis, or as an empirical treatment for fever,
in neutropenic patients [167]. As with many other highly
lipophilic drugs, brain tissue concentration is greater than
CSF [165]. Although 5% of itraconazole treated patients
develop some elevation of LFTs, this has lead to overt
liver damage in < o.o2% of treated patients [165].
In a study initiated on the basis of preclinical
evidence for itraconazole’s inhibition of angiogenesis,
Rudin et al recently showed prominent lengthening of
OS in itraconazole plus pemetrexed treated metastatic
nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer patients when
compared to those receiving pemetrexed alone [168].
Based on positive murine prostate cancer xenograft
studies, Antonarakis et al in a clinical study found clear
evidence for itraconazole’s anti-tumor effect- reduced
PSA levels [of note without effect on androgen levels],
shallower PSA slope, and fewer circulating cancer cells
in metastatic prostate cancer patient [169]. Skin biopsies
derived from these patients showed diminished Hedgehog,
Hh, signaling, [vide infra], a finding concordant with
studies on mesothelioma cells exposed to itraconazole
[170] and murine Hh signaling studies with itraconazole
[171].
Proton pump inhibitors, H2 inhibitors, and other
stomach acid reducing agents must be avoided during
itraconazole due to decreased absorption at higher pH
[172]. In HIV patients receiving ritonavir 400 mg twice
daily, the related azole antifungal drug ketoconazole
increased cerebrospinal fluid ritonavir (from 2.4 to 6.6
ng/mL) to disproportionately greater degree than it raised
blood ritonavir levels [173]. This was a major reason for
adding ketoconazole to the original CUSP9 regimen [1].
We believe itraconazole will achieve similar increased
ritonavir concentrations based on itraconazole’s similar
efflux pump inhibition as that seen with ketoconazole
[174, 175].
From the outset of our work constructing a noncytotoxic adjuvant protocol for cytotoxic treatment of
recurrent glioblastoma we considered 5-LO inhibition
as an important component. In a screen of hundreds of
FDA approved drugs across multiple classes, none of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Special position of 5-lipoxygenase
We now place greater emphasis on 5-LO in CUSP9*
than we did in CUSP9. Leukotrienes are arachidonate
derived signaling molecules of importance that are
overexpressed in many cancers [184] and demonstrated
to be so specifically in glioblastoma [185-189]. Given that
glioblastomas express excess 5-LO and that 5-LO product
leukotrienes are major mediators of glioblastoma-related
brain edema [185] we predict therefore that itraconazole
8062

Oncotarget

Itraconazole and p-gp

will lower brain edema and the consequent need for
dexamethasone. Steroid-sparing action alone would be
expected to improve QOL and OS [82, 190].
Itraconazole at low micromolar concentrations
inhibits synthesis of leukotriene LTB4 in activated
neutrophils even more deeply than does ketoconazole
or miconazole [191-193]. “Changes across metabolic
networks” [194] that are not malignant by themselves
become an integral part of malignant growth when
combined with the suite of so deranged networks and
genomic changes driving them. We aim to dismantle or
block enough of these networks to hobble glioblastoma
growth. Morin et al thinking along these lines found that
zileuton, a specific drug marketed as an 5-LO inhibitor [to
treat allergy symptoms] interferes with glioblastoma cell
line growth [194] as previously hypothesized by Omahen
in 2011 [195]. Herbal-derived 5-LO inhibitors [“Nordy”
and others] have also shown anti-glioma growth activity,
activity in xenograft model, cytotoxicity that exceeded
that of the classical alkylating cytotoxic drug carmustine
(BCNU) [196]. Itraconazole blocks 5-LO activity without
affecting activity of COX in vitro in low micromolar
concentrations [192], levels easily achieved in clinical use.
Much of our aim in CUSP9* is inhibiting or
blocking normal cell processes pathologically employed
by cancer cells to grow or evade senescence, apoptosis
or cytotoxicity. Others are thinking along these lines also
[196, 194, 196, 197].
Some glioblastoma patients currently use
cannabidiol, based on preclinical studies [198-200],
internet chatroom discussions, and anecdotal reports of
benefit. In a formal study of cannabidiol, much of the
in vitro anti-cancer and specifically anti-glioma effects
derive from its 5-LO inhibition. Cannabidiol is one of the
many biologically active but not psychoactive molecules
present in marijuana. It is sold openly, legally, and without
prescription in most jurisdictions on the herbal market.
Again within the principle of ¨ganging up¨ disulfiram
as well inhibited rat neutrophil soluble 5-LO with IC50 <1
micromol [201]. Diethyldithiocarbamate, the prominent
circulating metabolite of disulfiram, still had 5-LO
inhibiting properties but was less potent than its parent
compund [201]. Concordant with that work, disulfiram
inhibited LTB4 release from isolated human neutrophils
at IC50 <5 micromol and in an in vivo rat model but
less effectively so [202]. Thinking along these lines of
“ganging up”, similar to our CUSP9 protocol, Jiang et al
reported earlier this year [196] results from a drug screen
empirically looking at a thousand non-cytotoxic, noncancer chemotherapy-related FDA approved drugs for
cytotoxicity against glioma cell lines [196]. Two of the
CUSP9* drugs, itraconazole and sertraline happened to
have- as predicted in CUSP9 last year- to have good antiglioma cell activity (at least in vitro) [196].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Itraconazole significantly inhibited breast cancer
resistance protein, BCRP, efflux pump, thereby lowering
cytotoxicity resistance to topotecan [203] and leukemia
cell line resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide [204].
P-glycoprotein [p-gp] is a 170 kDa, ATP consuming,
outer cell membrane drug [xenobiotic molecule]
efflux pump synonomous with MDR-1 [205, 206]. It
preferentially exports lipophilic molecules, a veritable
intracellular “hydrophobic vacuum cleaner” [205]
particularly active at the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
endothelium [206]. Itraconazole is both an efflux substrate
and partial inhibitor of p-gp [206-208].
Recognizing itraconazole’s remarkably useful
attributes of both Hh signaling inhibition and p-gp
inhibition, a retrospective chart review showed that clear
cell ovarian cancer patients receiving itraconazole 2 days
before and during treatment with platinum and taxane
had over twice the overall survival compared to those
receiving the same chemotherapy regimen but without
itraconazole and had even greater effect in prolonging
survival in other forms of epithelial ovarian cancer [208].
Ritonavir
Ritonavir is a 721 Da protease inhibitor, the first
such approved for use in humans to treat HIV [209]. As
mentioned above, ketaconazole more than doubles CSF
ritonavir levels (2.4 to 6.6 ng/mL) in HIV positive people
[173]. Concomitant administration of ritonavir (400 mg
twice daily) plus ketoconazole [200 mg twice daily] was
well tolerated and resulted a in disproportionate increase in
CSF ritonavir level compared to a small increase in plasma
level [173]. Both drugs, ritonavir and ketoconazole, as
well as itraconazole, are substrates for and inhibitors of
p-gp and MRP1.
A trial of ritonavir 100mg with lopinavir 400 mg
twice daily reporting in 2011 showed little or no benefit
in prolonging OS of recurrent glioblastoma [210]. Of
uncertain significance, there was one complete radiological
remission that lasted 11 months before progression [210].
Parenthetically, note that in this report the published
doses of ritonavir and lopinavir were reversed from the
doses actually given. The authors have assured us that
he standard commercial capsules of KlatraTM (ritonavir
100mg with lopinavir 400 mg) were used.
Ritonavir inhibited in vitro proliferation of a glioma
cell line [211]. Ritonavir in vitro exposure increased
apoptosis and decreased proliferation of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines which led the authors to
conclude that using ritonavir in pancreatic duct cell cancer
by “drug repositioning...would limit the costs and reduce
risks” [212]. Our point exactly times nine.
Sato et al demonstrated renal cell carcinoma
proliferation inhibition by ritonavir in 2012 [213].
Cervical carcinoma in situ cells synthesize both MMP-2
and MMP-9. Activity of both was reduced by ritonavir
8063

Oncotarget

with corresponding in vitro invasion inhibition [214].
Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines’ growth was inhibited
by ritonavir as well [215].
The eleven members of the ABC efflux pump
group are associated with cancer chemotherapeutic drug
efflux from cells and therefore become an element of
chemotherapy resistance. Breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP), p-gp, or various multidrug resistance proteins are
better known members of this group and all are inhibited
to varying degrees by ritonavir [216]. Kumar et al showed
that ritonavir at 20 microM generated G1 cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines MDH-2774 and
SKOV-3 [217]. Kumar et al conclude that HIV protease
inhibitors like ritonavir “are efficient blockers of MDR1
(P-gp), MRP1 and BCRP” [217]. Ritonavir induced cellcycle arrest at G1-phase and apoptosis in EBV-positive
lymphoblastoid B cells in vitro [218].
Decreased AKT phosphorylation is a basic mode
of action in ritonavir cytotoxicity [212, 217, 219]. Again
the refrain, “[ritonavir] repositioning for ovarian cancer...
would reduce risks, limit the costs and decrease the time
needed to bring the drug from bench to bedside” [219].
We concur.
Ritonavir increases etoposide cytotoxicity in MRP1 over-expressing cells [220]. Long-term exposure to
ritonavir seems to upregulate p-gp expression [221] but
at the same time ritonavir inhibits the efflux of paclitaxel
and vinblastine in p-gp-positive cell lines [222]. Ritonavir
inhibited the xenobiotic export pump BCRP in low
micromolar concentrations but was not a substrate for
BCRP [223, 224]. A rat glioblastoma cell line’s in vitro
proliferation was suppressed by ritonavir, and direct
inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity by
ritonavir could be demonstrated. However, in an in vivo
rat model ritonavir had no effect on glioma growth [225].
To what extent the many paths of ritonavir-mediated
cell death in cancer cell lines and relative resistance to such
death in non-malignant cell lines [226 ] is fundamentally
secondary to AKT inhibition or not, is unknown.
Like itraconazole, ritonavir is both an efflux
substrate and partial inhibitor of p-gp [227-229].
Ritonavir penetration into normal brain tissue is poor
but as mentioned above adding ketoconazole increased
cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of ritonavir (from 2.4 to
6.6 ng/mL) in those receiving 400 mg ritonavir twice daily
[183]. We expect itraconazole to similarly assist ritonavir
penetration of the BBB.
Several multiple myeloma cell lines responded to
ritonavir with decreasing proliferation and increasing
apoptosis [230]. Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of hepatic
P450 3A4 and a clear but relatively weak inhibitor of p-gp
efflux pump, but together these two attributes ended up
increasing orally administered circulating docetaxel 50
fold [231]. Human endothelium growing in vitro show
mitochondrial DNA damage and reduced proliferation
after exposure to ritonavir [232.]. Colon carcinoma cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptosis was increased after exposure to ritonavir [233].
Ritonavir is a strong hepatic P450 3A4 inhibitor that
lowered affinity of activated NFkB with its DNA target
sequence [233]. Ritonavir enhanced radiation-induced
apoptosis in a murine model of head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma [234].
Sertraline
Introduction
Sertraline is a 306 Da antidepressant of the selective
serotonin re-uptake (SSRI) class with a minimal side effect
profile [235]. Sertraline is widely used worldwide. It is a
mainstay in current treatment of excessive anxiety states as
well. Side effects are usually well-tolerated consisting of
reduced libido (occurs in one third of treated patients) and
some loosening of bowel movements (in one tenth of those
treated). Other side effects are rare [235]. Sertraline is
also commonly used in metastatic cancer with co-morbid
depression where it is a safe and effective antidepressant/
anti-anxiety agent with side effects not different from that
seen when used in non-cancer settings [236].
Sertraline was included in the original CUSP9
protocol partly based on the empirical observation that
glioblastoma patients on SSRI class antidepressants had
a longer OS than those not on SSRIs [237]. The authors
of that study reported on a 1.6 month longer OS in those
treated with SSRIs which was not statistically significant
but we considered the possibility that if a larger cohort
continued to show similarly longer OS this would become
statistically significant [1]. The eminent safety and
tolerability of sertraline made the risk/benefit skewed
enough to include sertraline in CUSP9*.
Sertraline effects on cancer cells
Sertraline was shown to induce cytotoxicity in a
human osteosarcoma cell line [238], a human prostate
cancer cell line [239] and a squamous oral cancer cell
line [240] by mediating phospholipase C -dependent
Ca++ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, ER, and
Ca++ cell entry by L-type Ca++ channels. Inhibition
of proliferation by sertraline of colon cancer cell lines,
both in vitro and when xenografted, was traced to Bcl-2
inhibition [241]. In a drug pair study of sertraline in five
glioma cell lines (U87MG, U343MG, U373MG, A172,
T98G) robust inhibitory activity was seen across these
cell lines [242].
Translationally controlled tumor protein, TCTP,
is an ancient ~20 kDa intracellular chaperone protein
dysregulated in mammalian cancers [243]. TCTP is
seemingly closely related to heat shock proteins [244].
Sertraline inhibits TCTP [245-247].
An important role of TCTP relating to glioblastoma’s
treatment-resistance is TCTP’s non-covalent bonding to
p-53 preventing p-53’s function [248]. p-53 is a 44 kDa
protein active in both normal and malignant cells that,
although a multi-functional protein, i.a. is a transcription
8064

Oncotarget

factor leading to G1-arrest and/or apoptosis during
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thereby p-53 becomes most
important in cancer research and hence in CUSP9*
[249]. In glioblastoma, TCTP overexpression destabilizes
p-53, preventing p-53’s pro-apoptosis signaling during
chemotherapy [250]. By sertraline’s inhibition of TCTP
[245-247] we intend to restore some p-53 function.
Glioblastoma biopsy with TCTP overexpression
indicates a more aggressive clinical trajectory, have
a higher proliferation rate, and were associated with
shorter OS [250, 251]. Stemming from observations that
revertant subclones [sub-clones with reduced malignant
characteristics]of cancer cell lines had reduced TCTP
[247], sertraline was noted to both reduce TCTP and
enhance the reversion process [247]. An inverse reciprocal
quantitative relationship exists between TCTP and p-53.
TCTP enhanced p-53 degradation while p-53 repressed
TCTP transcription [245, 246]. The repressive function of
TCTP is inhibited by sertraline in a breast cancer cell line,
thereby de-repressing p-53, allowing resumption of p-53
mediated apoptosis [245].
Empirically, sertraline inhibited glioma cell line
U87 proliferation at even lower concentrations than
did temozolomide [252]. Proliferation inhibition at
low micromolar in vitro concentrations was also seen
in a breast cancer cell line that was traced to mTOR
inhibition [253]. Jurkat cell line proliferation was
inhibited by sertraline at lower concentration than by
vincristine or cyclophosphamide and cytotoxicity of
vincristine and doxorubicin was enhanced by clinically
achievable sertraline levels [254]. Melanoma xenograft
growth was inhibited likewise by sertraline at clinically
achievable doses and correlated with inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation[255].
The sertraline dose has been increased from 50 mg
twice daily to 100 mg twice daily in CUSP9* based on
early reports of good tolerability, increased fatigue has
been the main side effect noted from the increase, in those
who have taken it as part of compassionate use in CUSP9.

Vismodegib is a small molecule inhibitor of Hh
that, by binding to SMO, tends to limit efficiency of
Hh signaling [264, 265]. Vismodegib is FDA approved
and marketed in USA/Canada, and several countries
of the EU for treatment of metastatic or advanced basal
cell carcinoma [265]. Basal cell carcinoma gives us an
important lesson in understanding cancer in general and
with specific reference principles that drove our CUSP9*.
In basal cell carcinoma, Hh plays a central role and
acts in the absence of important enough cross-covering
growth signaling pathways such that effective tumor
growth suppression can be achieved with pharmacologic
inhibition using the small molecule drug vismodegib [264,
265, 266], inhibiting a single pathway. An easy enemy to
defeat.
Many other cancers where Hh has been shown to
have important growth stimulating role cannot be so easily
suppressed. In these cases, single agent inhibition of Hh is
not efficient. The lesson: basal cell cancer is an indolent
disease of low degree malignancy. Metastases are rare or
a late occurrence in disease course. Bulk tumor invasion
is clear but not very cancer-like (cf. cancer as crab).
Simple surgical resection commonly results in cure. The
microscopic invading tentacles common to other cancers
and responsible for local recurrence and metastases are not
usually seen in basal cell cancer. Corresponding to this it
seems that simple blocking of a single signaling path - Hh
- stops growth. The fact that vismodegib doesn’t cure other
cancers we take as evidence for multiple cross-covering
growth signaling paths being generally active in cancers
and specifically in glioblastoma. Hh has well documented
partially cross-covering intersections with four other
growth promoting pathways-1) RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK,
2) PI3K/AKT/mTOR, 3) EGFR [257]. Again we face the
Nile Distributary Problem and aim to address it with a
multi-drug regimen- CUSP9*.
Hh and Itraconazole
As mentioned itraconazole inhibits Hh signaling
[170, 171]. Murine medulloblastoma growth inhibition
by itraconazole was shown to act via Hh, specifically by
blocking SMO translocation [171, 267]. In accord with
previously documented Hh inhibition, a clinical study
showed that itraconazole at 100 mg twice daily inhibited
Hh signaling and proliferation in basal cell carcinomas
[267]. Of particular interest, confirming our understanding
of basal cell carcinoma, is the observation that basal
cell carcinomas previously exposed and resistant to
vismodegib showed no effect subsequent to itraconazole
treatment [267]. If these cancers were resistant to one Hh
inhibitor they were resistant to the other.
Mesothelioma cells were killed by Hh inhibition
by itraconazole to an equivalent degree as did Hh RNA
knockdown [170]. Itraconazole has significant antimyeloma cell activity via Hh inhibition, particularly so in
the ALDH co-expressing sub-population indicating Hh as

Hedgehog signaling pathway
General
The hedgehog signaling pathway, Hh, [256] is one of
the growth driving signaling systems in cancer generally
[257, 258] and in glioblastoma specifically [259, 260].
Autocrine, juxtacrine and paracrine Hh activation modes
are recognized. Hh signaling is a multi-stage process
starting at the base of cells’ cilia going to the cilia tip, then
back to cells’ nucleus. Glioblastoma cells bear cilia and
they are faulty [261, 262]. Hh is a particularly important
signaling system in that it branches out to transactivate
numerous other signaling systems [257], particularly so
and well documented in the case of glioblastoma [260,
263].

a stem cell feature [268].
Based on strong in vitro and in vivo (xenograft)
inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, migration,
and tubule formation in response to vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor
in non-small cell cancer models [269], a phase II study
compared standard cytotoxic therapy with or without daily
oral itraconazole in recurrent metastatic non-small cell
lung cancer [270]. The authors reported “trends suggestive
of improved disease control” in the cohort treated with
itraconazole 200mg/day [270].
In considering these data showing itraconazole as
both p-gp efflux inhibitor and an Hh inhibitor, Tsubamoto
et al found evidence for clinical activity in a 2014 clinical
trial of itraconazole in advanced clear cell epithelial
ovarian cancer [208].
High dose itraconazole [600 mg/day] given to men
with advanced prostate cancer resulted in halving of the
PSA level without changes in androgen [testosterone and
dehydroepiandrosterone] levels [271]. Intriguingly and
without current explanation, patients’ aldosterone dropped
to 25% of pre-itraconazole levels [271]. This latter finding
is particularly felicitous in that a study from 1994 showed
increased CSF aldosterone in brain tumor patients of
diverse pathologies including glioblastoma, which was
correlated to brain edema [272]. Since brain [273], and
glioblastoma tissue itself have autonomous functioning
renin-angiotensin systems [80, 274, 275], our expectation
is that much of itraconazole’s brain edema prevention
derives from this diminished aldosterone synthesis during
itraconazole treatment and will be augmented by our use
of captopril.

squamous cancer cell lines [281]. COX-2 inhibition
had little effect on proliferation but COX-2 inhibition
did increase LTB4 [281]. Knockdown of both COX-2
and 5-LO gave significantly impaired proliferation and,
parenthetically, VEGF production [281]. COX inhibitors
suppressed PGE2 production but enhanced LTB4 secretion
in COX-2 expressing colon cancer cell lines [278].
The reverse process can be seen as well. Some
patients given the marketed pharmaceutical 5-LO inhibitor
zileuton develop increased prostaglandin levels [282]. In
a cardiomyocyte cell line zileuton upregulated COX-2
expression [283]. We have therefore potential for a bound
bilateral see-saw [reciprocal] relationship between 5-LO
and COX-2, with either cross-covering for the other. A
specific example of the Nile Distributary Problem.

Dosing and practical considations
Dose suggestions
Specific addition and uptitration schedules are
available from the authors. The CUSP9* drugs are
generally forgiving and have been well-tolerated in the
handful of cases given CUSP9 drugs on a compassionateuse basis that have been reported to the authors to date. No
remarkable toxicities have been reported. This benign side
effect profile was expected based on wide experience over
decades of use with these drugs.
Artesunate and auranofin are the only two drugs
that might be unfamiliar to standard general medical
practioners. Artesunate, although widely used to treat
malaria around the world, is distinctly uncommonly used
in developed countries due to the rarity of malaria there.
Auranofin, although in use for several decades to treat
rheumatoid arthritis, is uncommonly used. Captopril,
celecoxib, ritonavir, and sertraline are common drugs,
not rarely used together in day-to-day medical practice.
Aprepitant is an unusually silent drug side effect wise
when used in chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting
control.
The doses for CUSP9* drugs are those commonly
used doses when given for their approved indicationsauranofin in rheumatoid arthritis, captopril for
hypertension, celecoxib for joint pain, itraconazole for
fungal infections. Doses for disulfiram and sertraline
are slightly higher than average dosing in alcoholism or
depression respectively, but CUSP9* doses below are at
the higher end of the dose range given clinically. CUSP9*
dose for artesunate, nominally ~ 1.4 mg/kg/day, is lower
than that used in malaria treatment, ~ 4 mg/kg/day [284]
but we will be using artesunate longer than is usual
during malaria treatment and chose a conservative dose.
Aprepitant is given at standard anti-emetic dose but for
longer duration than is current clinical practice.
Weekly evaluations with complete blood count are
essential given the potential for unforeseen drug-drug

Reciprocal 5-LO and COX shunting
Recent findings of a reciprocal shunting between
COX-2 and 5-LO [195, 276, 277] referred to earlier, has
necessitated adding COX inhibition (with celecoxib in
CUSP9*) along with the 5-LO inhibitor itraconazole. This
would be then a specifically delineated case of addressing
the Nile Distributary Problem. D.A. Omahen, noting
increased expression of both COX-2 and 5-LO in gliomas,
suggested in 2011 treating gliomas with simultaneous
COX and 5-LO inhibitors ¨using readily available, welltolerated medications¨, ¨thereby priming glioma cells for
treatment-induced apoptotic cell death¨ [195].
Examples of COX/5-LO reciprocal relationship
tendency: Smokers with elevated urinary PGE metabolite
levels showed decreased urinary PGE metabolite levels
after celecoxib administration but increased urinary
levels of LTB4 [278]. Exposure of human chondrocytes
to naproxen, a COX-1 and 2 inhibitor, increased LTB4
secretion and 5-LO mRNA [279].
Celecoxib had some 5-LO inhibition in a single
in vivo study [280] but COX-2 inhibition predominated.
Both COX-2 and 5-LO were up-regulated in head/neck

interactions in a medical regimen as complex as CUSP9*.
Monthly MRI’s will be done in the upcoming clinical trial.
Both theoretical considerations [starting with the drugs
least likely to give side effects [1] ] and limited initial
clinical experience suggest the following drug addition
schedule: The initial four drugs and doses are aprepitant 80
mg once daily, auranofin 3 mg once daily, celecoxib 200
mg once daily, disulfiram 250 mg once daily. These can
be started on day one. After seven days artesunate 50 mg
once daily, captopril 50 mg once daily, itraconazole 200
mg once daily, ritonavir 400 mg once daily, and sertraline
100 mg once daily are started. On the three week check
[day 21] drugs are brought to full doses, given below.
Aprepitant 80 mg twice daily.
Artesunate 50 mg twice daily.
Auranofin 3 mg twice daily.
Captopril 50 mg twice daily.
Celecoxib 400 mg twice daily
Disulfiram 250 mg twice daily.
Itraconazole 200 mg twice daily.
Ritonavir 400 mg twice daily.
Sertraline 100 mg twice daily.

inhibitors, itraconazole and riotonavir [see Table 4.]. This
necessitates particular strictness in avoidance of any herbal
preparations as well as any drug treatment beyond those
specified by the CUSP9* regimen and the four ancillary
drugs allowed- loperamide for diarrhea, lorazepam for
anxiety or insomnia, levetiracetam for seizures, low-dose
hydromorphone for headache.
Strictest avoidance of any source of ethanol, even in
such sources as wine vinegar or casseroles and grapefruit
juice avoidance [a 3A4 inhibitor] will be the only two
dietary restrictions. Coffee consumption is allowed but
caution advised, as caffeine effects can be magnified by
1A2 inhibitors like disulfiram.
Severe alcohol intolerance is not listed as a
disulfiram side effect in that severe intolerance of even
slight amounts of alcohol is universal and the main effect
of disulfiram.

Edema, dexamethasone, & survival
The use of dexamethasone is common during the
course of glioblastoma particularly in the perioperative
reduction of brain edema, but greater dexamethasone use is
a negative prognostic sign [285]. Dexamethasone or other
related corticosteroid use contributes to disease morbidity
and rarely, mortality. It is immunosuppressive [286],
exacerbating the inherent, unmedicated, glioblastomarelated immunosuppression [287], Dexamethasone
reduced in vitro temozolomide cytotoxicity in U87 [288]
and T98G glioma cells [289]. Although dexamethasone
has some anti-cancer activities in other cancers, and may
have such at some stages of glioblastoma, we consider the
sum of data indicates probable benefit from less, or ideally
no, dexamethasone use. We have outlined how several of
the CUSP9* medicines are expected to act together to
reduce glioblastoma related edema and thereby reduce or
eliminate the need for dexamethasone use in the course of
glioblastoma treatment.

Several practical recommendations
As part of CUSP9* we specify first-choice
medicines for four common problems arising in the course
of glioblastoma treatment generally. We specify these
drugs to treat ancillary problems due to the high potential
for drug-drug interactions when so many drugs are used at
once as in CUSP9*. The four selected drugs are unlikely
to interact pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically
with the CUSP9* drugs. No other medicine, herbal
preparation, over-the-counter medicine or nutritional
supplement will be allowed, again to minimize the risk of
drug-drug interaction.
i. Diarrhea can be treated with loperamide 2
mg ii bid. This dose can be increased or decresed as
needed. Loperamide is not absorbed systemically, yet by
stimulating gut opiate receptors effectively reduces the
loose bowel movements some of the CUSP9* drugs can
give.
ii. Anxiety or poor sleep should be treated with
lorazepam 1 mg or 2 mg at hour of sleep. This can be
increased or decreased as needed. Half this dose can be
used several times during the day should daytime anxiety
become a problem.
iii. If seizures occur levetiracetam 1 gram twice
daily can be used, with down titration if side effects are
encountered.
iv.
Headache
treatment
with
low-dose
hydromorphone is allowed.
An overview of pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic data and interaction analysis of the
CUSP9* drugs is given in Table 4. Ritonavir and
aprepitant are also inducers of 3A4. CUSP9* uses some
of the most potent hepatic [and small intestine] P-450 3A4

CONCLUSION
We presented six themes important to cancer
therapy generally that we apply to recurrent glioblastoma
treatment and attempt to address by CUSP9*:
1. Nile Distributary Problem where cancer uses
multiple cross-covering growth enhancing pathways to
grow and avoid cytotoxic interventions.
2. Intratumoral heterogeneity in space and over time
as general feature of cancer that must be accounted for in
treatment.
3. Individual mutually supporting sub-populations
existing within a tumor, working together to enhance
growth, generating vigor of the malignant state.
4. Ganging up. We see the need for multiple attacks
against the same growth-enhancing subsystem, again in
8067

Oncotarget

the effort to defeat compensating reactions by tumors.
5. We must fight today with the weapons we have
today. We therefore use ancillary attributes of nine
already-marketed drugs to condition glioblastoma cells to
be less fit to thrive.
6. “Changes across metabolic networks” that are
not malignant by themselves become an integral part of
malignant growth when combined with the suite of so
deranged networks and genomic changes driving them. We
aim to dismantle or block these pathologically employed
but not inherently pathological processes enough to hobble
glioblastoma growth.
We have shown how past research indicates how the
nine drugs of CUSP9* have a good chance of inhibiting
the growth enhancing functions of 17 different systems
used by glioblastoma to grow, migrate, and avoid cell
death. These growth systems are 1) AKT phosphorylation,
2) ALDH, 3) ACE, 4) carbonic anhydrase 2, 9, and 12, 5)
COX-2, 6) cathepsin B, 7) Hh, 8) interleukin-6, 9] 5-LO,
10) MMP-2 and -9, 11) mTOR, 12) NK-1, 12) p-gp efflux
pump, 14) thioredoxin reductase, 15) TF, 16) TCTP, and
17) VEGF.
Given the stalled progress in glioblastoma treatment
since the last advance, introduction of temozolomide with
the Stupp Protocol in 2005, we suggest a conceptual
departure from the usual cytotoxic efforts that have so
far been futile in prolonging survival or QOL. A formal
clinical trial of CUSP9* in patients on first recurrence is in
advanced stage planning. Initial experience on the handful
of patients as reported to us who were given CUSP9
without remarkable side effects leads us to be optimistic
that this will hold for the closely related CUSP9*.
To break the impasse we propose using nine
commonly used drugs marketed for non-cancer
indications, drugs that show minimal cytotoxicity to
normal cells and minimal changes to organ systems when
used singly. We use the nine drugs of CUSP9* to “shape
the battlefield”. By this we mean if we can inhibit or
block a pathological protective system engaged or used
by glioblastoma cells to grow, migrate, or avoid cell
death and senescence, our directly cell-killing drugs like
temozolomide will be more effective. The nine drugs of
CUSP9* each have data from animal and human study
showing they can individually inhibit or block one or
another identified cellular pathway to enhance or stimulate
their growth, helping CUSP9* drugs acting in concert to
set the stage for more effective cell killing.
