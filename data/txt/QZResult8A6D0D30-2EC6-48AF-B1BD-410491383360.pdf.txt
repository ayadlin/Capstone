ABSTRACT
Missense mutation of tumor suppressor p53, which exhibits oncogenic gain-offunction (GOF), not only promotes tumor progression, but also diminishes therapeutic
efficacies of cancer treatments. However, it remains unclear how a p53 missense
mutant contributes to induced pluripotency of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumors
exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. More importantly, it may be possible to abrogate
the GOF by restoring wild-type p53 activity, thereby overcoming the deleterious
effects resulting from heterotetramer formation, which often compromises the
efficacies of current approaches being used to reactivate p53 function. Herewith, we
report that p53 R273H missense mutant urges cancer cells to spawn CSCs. SW48/
TP53 cells, which heterozygously carry the p53 R273H hot-spot mutant (R273H/+,
introduced by a CRISPR/Casp9 system), were subchronically exposed to doxorubicin
in cell culture and in tumor-bearing mice. We found that p53-R273H (TP53-Dox)
cells were drug-resistant and exhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
increased numbers of CSCs (CD44v6+/CD133+), which resulted in enhanced wound
healing and tumor formation. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase with d-threo1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) sensitized p53-R273H
cancer cells and tumor xenografts to doxorubicin treatments. Intriguingly, PDMP
treatments restored wild-type p53 expression in heterozygous R273H mutant cells
and in tumors, decreasing CSCs and sensitizing cells and tumors to treatments. This
study demonstrated that p53-R273H promotes EMT and induced pluripotency of
CSCs in cancer cells exposed to doxorubicin, mainly through Zeb1 and β-catenin
transcription factors. Our results further indicate that restoration of p53 through
inhibition of ceramide glycosylation might be an effective treatment approach for
targeting cancers heterozygously harboring TP53 missense mutations.

and dysfunctional proteins [1, 2]. Alterations at codons
175, 248, and 273 constitute 19% of all TP53 mutations
reported, and are considered to be mutation hotspots in
human cancers, including those occurring in colon and
lungs [1–3] (http://p53.free.fr/Database/p53_cancer/all_
cancer.html). Missense versions of p53 that lack the tumor
suppression activity of wild-type p53 (wt p53) instead
often exhibit oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) [4].

INTRODUCTION
The p53 protein, encoded by human gene TP53,
functions as a key tumor suppressor that stabilizes the
genome with respect to propensity for tumorigenesis and
cancer progression. The TP53 gene is somatically mutated
in over half of all cancer cases. More than 80% of TP53
alterations are missense mutations, encoding full-length

RESULTS

Knock-in mouse models that express hotspot mutant
alleles R172H or R270H (R175H or R273H in the human
versions) manifest GOF by conferring a broader tumor
spectrum and more tumor metastases, as compared with
wt p53-expressing mice [5, 6]. TP53 mutants are observed
more frequently in tumors diagnosed at advanced stages,
or with more metastases, and in recurrences of cancer in
colon, ovaries and breasts [7–9].
Despite the well-known fact that expression of
p53 mutants correlates strongly to poor prognosis in
cancer patients, the exact roles in the promotion of cancer
progression played by p53 mutants, which vary in type
as well as position, remain as yet unclear. Recent reports
document that inactivation of p53 function enhances
the production efficiency, and decreases the latency for
emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
in cell culture [10, 11]. iPSCs can be generated from
somatic cells of mouse and of human by introduction of
Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc transcription factors [12].
Suppression of p53 with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
increased the efficiency of iPSC generation from human
fibroblasts, indicating that the p53-p21 pathway serves as
a barrier to iPSC generation [13]. With Oct4 and Sox2
reprogramming, p53-knockout cells merely maintained
their pluripotent capacity in vivo, whereas mutant p53
(R172H) mouse cells gave rise to malignant tumors, with
inherent oncogenic GOF attributable to the involvement
of Klf4 [14].
Metastasis and drug resistance are major
limitations to the survival and management of patients
with cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which possess
malignant capacities of self-renewal and pluripotency,
not only lead tumorigenesis, but also drive tumor
progression and are responsible for treatment failure
[15, 16]. Most cytotoxic agents in chemotherapy damage
DNA or disrupt mitosis to induce cell death in highly
proliferative populations of cancer cells. Chemotherapy
often eliminates differentiated cells in tumors, but
surviving CSCs (which do not rapidly proliferate)
may cause disseminated metastases or recurrence of
aggressive tumors upon treatment failure. Recent studies
have convincingly shown enrichment with CSCs in
populations of breast, ovarian and colon cancer cells
that have become drug resistant following sequential
exposure to anticancer drugs, including doxorubicin,
paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) [17–19]. Enrichment
with CSCs is also observed in xenogeneic tumors
following chemotherapies [20, 21]. Similarly, after
systemic chemotherapy of cancer patients, CSCs are
increased in breast and lung cancers [22, 23].
Aiming to understand the roles played by
p53 mutants in promoting tumor progression and
in chemotherapy failure, we studied EMT and CSC
populations pursuant to various treatments in cancer cells
heterozygously carrying a p53 missense mutation, in cell
culture and in tumor-bearing mice.

R273H p53 mutant is a promoting factor for
drug resistance and induced EMT of colon
cancer cells
It has been reported that p53 missense mutants,
including those at “hotspot” codons 248 and 273, conferred
oncogenic GOF in cells and in transgenic mice [24, 25]. We
examined cell response to doxorubicin in human COLO
320DM (COLO) and WiDr colon cancer cells, which
carry homozygous p53-R248W and p53-R273H mutations
[26, 27], respectively. COLO and WiDr cells were significantly
resistant to doxorubicin as compared to wt p53 SW48 colon
cancer cells, or MCF-12A noncancerous epithelial cells
(Figure 1A left-panel). The IC50 values for doxorubicin in
COLO and WiDr are 36-fold (1.50 vs. 0.04 μM, p<0.001)
and 18-fold (0.78 vs. 0.04, p<0.001) higher than in SW48
cells. Other missense mutant SW48/TP53 (TP53) cells,
which heterozygously carry p53-R273H knocked in by
using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system [28], however,
showed responses to doxorubicin similar to those of its
parental SW48 colon cancer line (wt p53) (Figure 1A rightpanel). To characterize the association of GOF with acquired
drug resistance during chemotherapy, we cultured TP53 as
well as SW48 cells in 10% FBS medium with sub-lethal
concentrations of doxorubicin (5-25 nM) for approximately
26 passages. As shown in Figure 1A (right-panel), exposure
to doxorubicin induced drug resistance in heterozygous
p53-R273H mutant cells. The IC50 value for doxorubicin
in TP53-Dox cells increased by 24-fold (1255 vs. 49.2
nM, p<0.001) over that seen for naïve SW48/TP53 cells;
however, the IC50 values in SW48-Dox cells did not change
significantly (45 vs. 50 nM) versus naïve SW48 cells
(Figure 1A right panel).
GOF associated with the homozygous presence of
mutant proteins (R273H, R175H) has been reported to
induce EMT in colon cancer WiDr, endometrial cancer
HEC-50, and prostate cancer DU145 cells [29–31]. Until
now, the question as to whether or not the heterozygous
presence of a particular missense p53 mutation might
play any significant role(s) in the emergence of EMT
during cancer progression had remained unanswered. In
our EMT study, we did not find obvious alterations in
morphology, or in EMT-hallmark E-cadherin (ECAD)
or vimentin (VIM) expression changes, in TP53 cells
with heterozygous p53-R273H, as compared to SW48
cells (Figure 1B left-panels). Interestingly, doxorubicin
exposure induced a shift in cell morphology from a paved
stone epithelial appearance (in TP53 cells) to phenotypes
of a more mesenchymal character in TP53-Dox cells, with
loss of cell-to-cell contact and increased cell spreading
(Figure 1B right-panels). These morphological changes
were accompanied by the upregulated expression of
mesenchymal marker VIM, and decreased expression
of the epithelial marker ECAD (Figure 1B, 1C). These

and p53-responsive genes. A previous report showed
that isogenic TP53 cells expressed the R273H mutant in
response to a presence of 5-fluorouracil [28]. In the present
study, p53 expression, in TP53 and TP53-Dox cells, in
each case assessed either as pan-p53 or as phosphorylated
p53 only (pp53, Ser15), was not altered in response to
DNA damage induced by doxorubicin, in contrast to
behavior of SW48 and SW48-Dox cells, which carry wt
p53 (Figure 4A, 4C). Significantly, the protein levels of
p53, pp53, p21 and Puma were decreased in TP53-Dox
cells as compared to SW48-Dox cells. Long-term Dox
exposure (26-passages) significantly enhanced the protein
levels of β-catenin, TGF-β, and Oct4 in both SW48Dox and TP53-Dox cell sublines, as compared to naïve
SW-48 and TP53 cells, respectively (Figure 4B, 4C).
However, Dox exposure increased c-Myc and Zeb1 levels
exclusively in TP53-Dox, but not in SW48-Dox cells
(Figure 4B, 4C).
Our previous studies showed that ceramide can
restore wt p53 expression and functional activity in
ovarian cancer OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells that
carry p53 deletion mutations in codons 126-132 and 126133, respectively [32, 33]. Until now, it remained unknown
whether or not cells harboring p53 missense mutants could
be restored to express wt p53 protein. Intriguingly, we
found that PDMP treatments, which inhibited GCS and
increased cellular ceramide (Figure 2B, 2C, 4D), restored
wt p53 expression as well as p53-responsive proteins in
TP53-Dox cells (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D). The levels of
pp53, and of several proteins encoded by p53-responsive
genes (p21, Bax and Puma), are substantially enhanced in
TP53-Dox cells treated with PDMP, and those levels are
almost equal to those observed in SW48 cells that carry wt
p53 (Figure 4A). Moreover, PDMP treatments exclusively
decreased the protein levels of β-catenin, TGF-β, c-Myc,
Klf4, and Zeb1 in TP53-Dox cells (Figure 4B, 4C),
whereas PDMP treatment significantly lowered Oct4 in
both SW48-Dox and TP53-Dox cells. These results, taken
in aggregate with the observed array of expression level
changes between cell lines and sub-lethal Dox exposure,
indicate that increased ceramide levels brought about
by inhibition of GCS restores wt p53 expression in cells
harboring a p53-R273H mutant allele. Also, the promoting
effects of p53 R273H mutation on the spawning of
induced cancer stem cells are seen to be highly associated
with Zeb1, c-Myc, β-catenin, and Klf4.

p53-R273H mutant promotes the pluripotency of
colon cancer cells exposed to doxorubicin
We carried out experiments with a wound healing
assay and observed a significant increase in migration
ability of TP53-Dox cells, as compared with TP53 cells or
SW48-Dox cells (Figure 2A). The wound healing seen with
TP53-Dox cells was increased by more than twofold (83%
vs. 29.9%, p<0.001) as compared to the Dox-naïve TP53
cells, and was also significantly higher than for SW48-Dox
cells (Figure 2A). In contrast, the wound healing was not
significantly different between SW48-Dox and SW48 cells.
Furthermore, we treated SW48-Dox and TP53-Dox cells
with PDMP, a glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor
[32, 33]. Interestingly, we found that PDMP treatments
significantly reduced wound healing of TP53-Dox cells,
by more than twofold (36 vs. 83%, p<0.001; Figure 2A).
PDMP treatments reduced GCS activities in TP53-Dox
cells, by more than fivefold (25 vs. 131 fmol/μg protein,
p<0.001), but not in SW48-Dox cells (Figure 2B). PDMP
treatments doubled cellular levels of several species of
ceramides (Cers), including C14-Cer, C18-Cer, C20-Cer,
C22-Cer, C24:1-Cer and C26:1-Cer in TP53-Dox cells, as
detected by ESI/MS/MS analysis (Figure 2C).
In addition to drug resistance, EMT plays critical roles
in modulating cancer stem-like cell phenotype [34]. To test
possible roles played by p53 R273H mutant in acquisition
of cancerous stemness, we further investigated the effects of
R273H on the self-renewal potential of cells using a sphere
formation assay. We found that the numbers of enlarged
tumor spheres increased in TP53-Dox cells, comparing to
SW48-Dox cells. PDMP treatments substantially decreased
sphere numbers, by twofold (33 vs. 67, p<0.001) in TP53Dox cells (Figure 3A); however, PDMP treatment did not
significantly alter tumor spheres in SW48-Dox cells. We
next looked for CSCs with CD44v6+/CD133+ phenotype
among cells in these lines, as a CD44v6+/CD133+ phenotype
has been associated with CSCs in tumors and in cells of
colon cancers [35]. It was found that CSC populations
increased fourfold in TP53-Dox cells (1.2 vs. 4.6%,
p<0.001) as compared to in SW48-Dox cells (Figure 3B).
With PDMP treatment, CSC populations in TP53-Dox cells
significantly decreased, by approximately 3.5-fold (4.6% vs.
1.23%, p<0.001), whereas PDMP treatments did not have a
significant effect in SW48-Dox cells (Figure 3B).

tumor-bearing mice after doxorubicin treatments (200, 300
μg/kg) (Figure 5A-5C). However, PDMP treatments (4.0
mg/kg) significantly decreased tumor growth and tumor
weight in TP53 tumor-bearing mice (Figure 5A-5C), but
not in those with tumors generated from SW48 cells.
HPLC analysis indicated that GCS activities in TP53generated tumors were significantly higher (156 vs. 102
fmol/μg, p<0.001) than in SW48 tumors of mice treated
with sub-therapeutic doses of doxorubicin (200 μg/kg)

GCS activities, more than threefold (156 vs. 48 fmol/μg,

p<0.001) versus those seen in TP53 tumors treated with
doxorubicin alone (Figure 5D).
Western blot analysis of TP53-generated tumors
showed a pronounced dearth of pp53 (~3-fold less), and
of the protein products of the p53-responsive genes,
including p21, Bax and Puma, as compared to levels
seen for SW48-generated tumors (Figure 6A). PDMP
treatments substantively restored wt p53 expression and
downstream responses in tumors carrying p53 R273H
mutation: the protein levels of pp53 (>3-fold), p21 (>3fold), Bax and Puma are substantially increased in TP53
tumors treated with PDMP combined with doxorubicin,

exhibiting levels almost equal to those seen in SW48generated tumors, which carry wt p53 (Figure 6A). The
immunohistochemistry findings were concordant, as we
once again observed that combining PDMP with subchronic Dox treatment increased pp53 and p21 in TP53
tumors (Figure 6B).

Furthermore, we found that sub-chronic doxorubicin
treatments (200 μg/kg) significantly induced the numbers
of CSCs (CD44v6+/CD133+), by threefold (4.9% vs.
1.7% of total tumor cells, p<0.001) in TP53 tumors, as

more than twofold (4.9% vs. 1.9% of total tumor cells,
p<0.001) in TP53 tumors treated with PDMP combined
doxorubicin, but not in SW48 tumors (Figure 7A). These
PDMP-combined treatments did not significantly affect
bone marrow stem cells (ABCG2+), nor did they impact
GCS activities of bone marrow, either in SW48- or TP53tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B).
Western blot analysis indicated that TGF-β,
c-Myc, Zeb1 and Oct4 are pronouncedly increased in
TP53-generated tumors after doxorubicin treatments, as
compared to SW48-tumors (Figure 7B). PDMP treatments
dramatically decreased the protein levels of β-catenin,
c-Myc, Klf4, Zeb1 and Oct4 in TP53-tumors (Figure 7B),
while these combined treatments significantly decreased
only β-catenin, Klf4, and Oct4 in SW48-tumors. These

findings further corroborate the results of cell-culture
studies, demonstrating that GOF associated with p53
R273H mutation induces the production of iPSCs via
Zeb1, c-Myc and TGF-β transcription factors.

of ceramide synthase [33], abrogated the restorative effect

[37], which clearly suppresses p53-R273H along with
that of wt p53, also decreased pp53 production (>50fold), increased β-catenin (2-fold) and Zeb1 protein levels
(6-fold) (Figures 8A, 8B), and accordingly increased the
IC50 of doxorubicin (Figures 8C, 8D) in TP53-Dox cells
treated with siRNA-p53, as compared to siRNA-SC or
PDMP treatment. These results indicate that substantive
restoration of wt p53 expression and function, mediated by
ceramide, sensitized drug-resistant R273H cancer cells to

doxorubicin. Further, ceramide-modulated wt p53 activity
in TP53-Dox cells treated with PDMP or MBO-asGCS
significantly decreased the protein levels of Zeb1 and
β-catenin (Figure 8B), which are essential factors involved
in EMT, as noted above. Taken together, these results

DISCUSSION

attributes to CSC presence and pluripotent stem-like
phenotypic character [38–40]. p53 clearly plays a major
role in iPSC generation from noncancerous cells, in
both attenuating reprogramming and controlling the
qualities of reprogrammed cells [41]. p53 function in
iPSCs exerts an indirect effect on proliferation arrest and
on the restriction of mesenchymal-epithelial transition
(MET) during its early phases [42]. Inactivation of p53
function is associated with the acquisition of stem-like

We demonstrated that the presence of heterozygous
p53 R273H mutant is an underlying factor promoting
the occurrence of iPSCs in colon cancer cells, and
in xenografted tumors exposed to chemotherapeutic
agents. GOF associated with mutant p53 proteins can
enhance the ability of cancer cells to invade, metastasize,
and poorly respond to chemotherapies, all of which

phenotypic character in reprogrammed cells and in cancers
[14, 43–46]. Heterozygous p53 missense mutations are
more common than any other mutants in cancers. This is
particularly true for sarcomas of Li-Fraumeni syndrome
patients. Patients with p53 mutant cancers often have
poor prognoses in treatments; however, to date it remains
unclear which particular p53 mutants cause this to be
so, how significant the impacts are for each mutant, and
in each case the exact mechanistic bases for the clinical
observations with respect to chemotherapy resistance. The
studies presented herein, carried out in cell culture and
in xenografted tumor-bearing mice, showed that low-dose
doxorubicin induced EMT (Figure 1), augmented CSC
numbers, promoted tumor growth, and conferred drug
resistance (Figures 1, 3, 5, 7, 8) for cancer cells carrying a
heterozygous p53 R273H mutation.
R273 is a mutation hotspot codon, with variants
R273H, R273C and R273G occurring most commonly
in tumor samples from patients. R273H and R273C,
for which expression levels do rise in response to DNA
damage and repair, bind less tightly to DNA, and tend to
stimulate production of proteins having protective and
repair functions, including BRCA1, TOPBP1 and MDC1,
thereby leading to a more-aggressive phenotype [47].
We found that the presence of the heterozygous R273H
allele led to inadequate levels (or even complete lack of
appearance) of the p53-responsive proteins p21, Bax and
Puma, which are normally induced in response to p53
after DNA damage. The response failure is especially
noteworthy for p21, which strongly constrains cell
proliferation in normally differentiated, non-cancerous
cells [13]. More importantly, in the R273H mutantharboring cells, upregulated expression of Zeb1, β-catenin,
TGF-β, c-Myc, and Oct4 was observed; these transcription
factors reportedly can de-differentiate adult cells [12] and
augment the malignant potential of reprogrammed cells

after transduction [14, 48]. Furthermore, the heterozygous
presence of R273H mutant alone did not intrinsically
confer drug resistance or directly induce EMT in cultured
SW48/TP53 cells (Figures 1, 8); these characteristics arose
only following chronic low-dose doxorubicin exposure,
and extended to other chemotherapeutic agents besides
doxorubicin. These observations indicate that the presence
of the p53 missense mutation acts as an underlying
promoting factor for the generation of iPSCs in tumors
exposed chronically to anticancer drugs.
Resuscitating normal function of the p53 mutant
protein when its mutant forms are extant constitutes an
attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatments [49],
and restoration of wt p53 protein expression levels and
functional normalcy holds promise for targeting the
majority of p53-mutant cancers more effectively [50].
The tumor-suppressing functions of p53 mainly rely on
binding of its homotetrameric form to DNA, thereupon
suitably activating or repressing the expression of p53responsive genes. Restoration of wt p53 expression can
switch mutant phenotype to wt by reducing the formation
of heterotetramers (wt proteins with mutant proteins) that
bind to DNA in place of normal homotetramer, bringing
about oncogenic GOF in p53-mutant-harboring cancer
cells [50].
Our previous studies showed that inhibition of
ceramide glycosylation, either by silencing of GCS
expression with MBO-asGCS or by inhibiting GCS
activity with PDMP, increased cellular ceramide levels
and restored wt p53 expression as well as p53-dependent
apoptosis in cancer cells carrying p53 deletion mutants
[32, 33]. In the study we report herein, suppression of
ceramide glycosylation restored wt p53 expression in
TP53 cells that carry a R273H missense mutation allele,
with dramatic increases in the protein levels of pp53 and
p21 (Figures 4A, 6A). As a downstream consequence,

Figure 9: Ceramide restores wild-type p53 expression in cells heterozygously carrying a p53 R273H mutant allele.

When mutant-heterozygous (HZ) cancer cells are exposed to a sub-lethal dose of doxorubicin (Dox), DNA damage induces overexpression
of p53 R273H, and the presence of this missense mutant protein upregulates Zeb1 and β-catenin (β-Cat) stem-like factors. The consequent
gain-of-function (GOF) presents as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and induced pluripotency of stem cells (iPSCs), lending to
tumor growth. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed ceramide glycosylation with PDMP increases cellular ceramide
levels, bring about restoration of wt p53 protein expression, in turn increasing p53-responsive proteins, including p21 and Puma, thereby
suppressing tumor progression.

restoration of p53 function further prevented GOFassociated induced pluripotency of CSCs (Figures 1B,
3, 5, 7A), by bring about decreased expression of Zeb1,
β-catenin, TGF-β, cMyc and Oct4 (Figures 4, 7). Previous
studies showed that targeting GCS overexpression
enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer
drugs and decreased tumor formation [36, 51–55]. In drugresistant cancer cells, elevated ceramide glycosylation
led to increased levels of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3),
which can upregulate multidrug resistant gene 1 (MDR1)
[52, 53] through activation of the β-catenin signaling
pathway. Increased levels of Gb3 and gangliosides
GD2 caused enrichment with CSCs in breast cancers;
accordingly, inhibition of GCS lowered CSC numbers,
as well as tumor formation [54, 55]. The novel finding
in present study is that the increased levels of ceramide
(Figures 2B, 2C, 8A, 8B), rather than decreased levels of
glycosphingolipids, eliminated oncogenic GOF of p53 in
iPSC, via reactivation of wt p53 expression in cancer cells
carrying a heterozygous p53 missense mutation.
To our knowledge, this might be the first study
showing that normal p53 expression and function can be
restored in cancer cells heterozygously harboring a p53
missense mutant allele, in this case a R273H. A recent
study documented that activation of chaperone-mediated
autophagy degrades mutant p53, including R175H and
R273H, and sensitizes cancer cells to treatment-responsive
death [56]. Ceramide can mediate phosphorylation of
SRSF1 to select wt p53 mRNA for protein expression in
cancer cells carrying p53 deletion mutation [33]. Yu et al.
recently reported that NSC319726, a thiosemicarbazone
compound, can reactivate an R175 p53 mutant so as to
upregulate the expression of p21, and thereby induce
apoptosis for cancer treatment [57]. All these indicate it
is feasible to reactivate wt p53 expression and anticancer
activity in cancer cells carrying missense mutation,
although further studies are required to figure out how
post-transcriptional processing modulates p53 expression.

its corresponding TP53 missense mutant (R273H/+) line,
were purchased from Horizon Discovery (HD 103-008,
Waterbeach, Cambridge, UK) [28]. SW48 cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS,
100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2
mM l-glutamine. SW48/TP53 (TP53) cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium including 2 mM l-glutamine and
25 mM sodium bicarbonate supplement with 10% FBS
and 800 μg/mL geneticin (G418). Cells were maintained
in an incubator humidified with 95% air and 5% CO2 at
37°C. SW48-Dox and TP53-Dox, which are sublines of
SW48 and SW48/TP53 cells, were cultured in 10% FBS
RPMI-1640 medium containing 25 nM doxorubicin (Dox)
for 16 weeks (~26 passages).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by quantitation of
ATP, an indicator of live cells, using the CellTiter-Glo
luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, WI)
kit, as described previously [32, 58]. Briefly, cells (4000
cells/well) were grown in 96-well plates with 10% FBS
supplemented RPMI-1640 medium. Cells were treated
with test agents in 5% FBS medium for 72 hours. Cell
viability was determined by the measurement of ATP in
a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek, Winnooski,
VT, USA), following incubation with CellTiter-Glo
reagent. For combination treatment, cells (3×106
/100-mm dish; 4000 cells/well in 96-well plates) were
grown in 10% FBS RPMI-1640 medium overnight
and then cultured in 5% FBS medium containing
d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1propanol HCl (PDMP; 5 μM) or fumonisin B1 (FB1,
25 μM) and doxorubicin (Dox; 5~2.0 μM) for 48 hr.
PDMP was purchased from Matreya (State College,
PA) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO).

Tumor sphere formation assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A tumor sphere formation assay was carried
out as described previously, with minor modification
[54, 59]. Briefly, cells of SW48-Dox and TP53-Dox
lines (10 to 10,000 cells/well) were plated in ultralowattachment 24-well plates (Corning, Lowell, MA) with
DMEM-F12 (1:1) medium containing insulin (5 μg/mL),
human basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/mL), human
epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL) and 0.4% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). For PDMP treatments, cells were
pretreated with PDMP (5 μM) in 10% FBS RPMI-1640
medium for 6 days; the medium was refreshed on day
4. The cells of spheres (>50 μm) were counted using a
hemocytometer following trypsinization. Sphere images
(200× magnification) were captured using the EVOS
FL cell imaging system with color CCD camera (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY).

Cell culture and treatments
Human COLO 320DM (homozygous R248W
p53) and WiDr (homozygous R273H p53) colon cancer
cell lines, and MCF-12A (wild-type p53) immortalized
epithelial cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas,
VA). COLO 320DM and WiDr were cultured in RPMI1640 or ATCC-formulated EMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/
mL streptomycin and 584 mg/L l-glutamine. MCF12A cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium-F12 (1:1) with 5% horse serum, insulin (5 μg/
ml), hydrocortisone (500 ng/ml), human epidermal
growth factor (20 ng/ml) and cholera toxin (100 ng/
ml). Human colon cancer SW48 cells and also cells of

Gene silencing of GCS and p53

Immunocytochemistry

Silencing of GCS and p53 was accomplished as
described previously [32, 33, 36]. Mixed-backbone
oligonucleotide (MBO-asGCS, 100 nM) or siRNA
(siRNA-p53, siRNA-SC; 100 nM) were introduced into
TP53-Dox cells (3 × 106 /100-mm dish; 4000 cells/well
in 96-well plates) after overnight growth, facilitating
with Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM reduced-serum
medium (Invitrogen) for 4 hr. The cells continuously
grew in 5% FBS medium for an additional 48 hr. In
combination groups, cells were treated with PDMP (5
μM) in Opti-MEM medium for 4 hr, after siRNA-p53
transfection, and further grown in 5% FBS medium.
To co-silence GCS and p53, cells were transfected
with both MBO-asGCS and siRNA-p53 (or siRNA-SC
as a control) simultaneously. In the last 48 hr of
treatments, cells were cultured in medium containing
20 nM Dox to induce DNA damage. MBO-asGCS [36]
was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies
(Coralville, IA). siRNA targeting human p53 (sc-29435)
[37] and the scrambled control (siRNA-SC, sc-37007)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA).

Cells (20,000 cells/chamber) were grown in
4-chamber slides for 48 hr. After methanol fixation, cells
were blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and incubated with antibodies against
E-cadherin or vimentin, phosphorylated p53 Ser15,
ceramide (clone MID 15B4 from Sigma) and p21 (1:100
dilutions) in blocking solution at 4°C, overnight. Primary
antibodies were further recognized by Alexa-Fluor 555or 488-conjugated goat IgG (1:2000), respectively. Cell
nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole) in mounting solution (Vector Laboratories).
Images (200× magnification) were captured using the
EVOS FL cell imaging system with color CCD camera
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
Tumors were fixed and maintained in paraffin
blocks. Microsections (5 μm) of tumors were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and characterized by a
pathologist. For immunostaining, antigens were retrieved
in steaming sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, 0.05%
Tween-20, pH 6.0). After blocking with 5% goat serum
in PBST, slides were immunostained, as described above.

Flow cytometry assay

Western blot analysis

Flow cytometry was carried out as described
previously [21, 54]. For analysis of CSCs, cells of SW48Dox and TP53-Dox lines were treated with PDMP (5
μM) for 6 days, and then harvested with trypsinization
and centrifugation. Suspended cells (106 cells/ml) were
incubated with CD44v6 Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated
antibody (2F10; mouse IgG1; purchased from R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and CD133/2 APC-conjugated
antibody (293C3, mouse IgG2b; purchased from Miltenyi
Biotec, San Diego, CA) in 1% BSA-containing PBS at
4°C for 45 min. After washing, cells were resuspended
in 1% BSA PBS (1 mL) and analyzed by flow cytometry,
using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) operated with CellQuest Pro software (BD
Biosciences), and the data were further analyzed by using
the FlowJo program (v10; FlowJo, Ashland, OR). For
each sample, 10,000 events were counted in triplicate. To
identify CD44v6+/CD133+ cells, samples obtained under
different treatments were incubated in 1% BSA PBS for
measuring autofluorescence.
To analyze CSCs in mice, resected tumors (~60
mg) were immediately dispersed in RPMI-1640 medium
with collagenase IV (500 units/mL) at 37°C for 120 min
with shaking (20 rpm). After filtration through a 70-μm
cell strainer, cells were incubated with APC-CD44 v6 and
PE-CD133/2 IgG for flow cytometry analysis as described
above. Collected bone marrow cells (BMCs) from each
mouse were counted with a hemocytometer. The ABCG2+
BMCs were analyzed by flow cytometry, following
the incubation of BMCs with anti-ABCG2 antibody, as
described previously [21].

Western blotting was carried out as described
previously [33, 54]. Briefly, cells or tissue homogenates
were lysed in NP40 cell lysis buffer (Biosource,
Camarillo, CA, USA) to extract total cellular proteins
once the treatment was finished. Protein was measured
by using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of proteins
(50 μg/lane) were resolved by using 4-20% gradient
SDS-PAGE (Life Technology). After transferring,
blots of nitrocellulose membrane were blocked in 5%
fat-free milk in 0.05% Tween-20, 20 mM phosphatebuffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBST), and then incubated with
each one of the primary antibodies (1:500 or 1:2000
dilution), at 4°C overnight. After PBS washing, these
blots were incubated with corresponding horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000
dilutions) and developed using SuperSignal West Femto
substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as
a loading control for cellular protein. Relative protein
levels present were calculated from the OD values,
normalized against those for GAPDH. Antibodies
against human p53 phosphorylated at Ser15, and against
c-Myc, Klf4, Zeb1, and Oct4, were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibody for
glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was purchased from
GeneScript (Piscataway, NJ). Antibodies for Puma,
p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax, p53, E-cadherin, vimentin, TGF-β,
β-catenin, and GAPDH were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).

Glucosylceramide synthase assay

Tumor-bearing mice and treatments

GCS activity was assayed as described previously
[60, 61], with modification. Briefly, cells were grown 24
hr in 35-mm dishes (5×106 cells/dish) in 10% FBS RPMI1640 medium, and then switched to 1% BSA RPMI-1640
medium containing 2.0 μM 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole
(NBD) C6-ceramide complexed to BSA (Invitrogen).
After 2 h incubation at 37°C, cellular lipids were
extracted and reconstituted with chloroform/methanol
(1:1, v/v; 200 fluorescence units/100 μl). From this
preparation, a 5-μl of portion was loaded by autosampler
onto a normal-phase silica column (ZORBAX Rx-SIL,
5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). NBD sphingolipids were eluted
by linear gradient (0-14 min, 1 ml/min) using solvent
system A (chloroform/methanol/ortho-phosphoric acid)
(80:20:0.1, v/v/v) and solvent system B (chloroform/
methanol/H2O/ortho-phosphoric acid) (60:34:6:0.1,
v/v/v/v), and detected with an Agilent 1260 fluorescence
detector (λexcitation= 470 nm, λemission = 530 nm) (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA; HPLC system: Agilent 1220 Infinity
LC Gradient System VL). Individual sphingolipids were
identified and quantitated with a separate standard curve
for each. Each sample was analyzed at least three times,
and GCS activity is defined in terms of glucosylceramide
produced in 2 hr normalized against total cellular
proteins. To assess tumor GCS activity, tumors were
pieced (<1 mm) and digested with collagenase IV for
2 hr, and samples were then prepared and processed as
described above.

All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University
of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM), and were carried out in
strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by
NIH guidelines. Athymic nude mice (Foxn1nu/Foxn1+, 4-5
weeks, female) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis,
IN) and maintained in the vivarium at ULM. Animal
studies were conducted as described previously [32,
36, 53]. Briefly, a cell suspension of SW48 and SW48/
TP53 (2-3 passages, 1×106 cells in 20 μl/mouse) was
subcutaneously injected in the left flank of the mice. Mice
were monitored by measuring tumor growth and body
weight, under clinical observation. Once tumors were
visible (2 mm in diameter), mice were randomly allotted to
different treatment groups (5 mice/group). For treatments,
PDMP (4.0 mg/kg once every 3 days) was administered
intraperitoneally alone or with doxorubicin (200 or 300
μg/kg once every 6 days) for 32 days. Tumor volume was
approximated by the formula L/2 × W2 (where L is the
length and W is the width). Tumors and metastases were
examined and characterized by pathologist following H&E
staining of tissue sections at Louisiana State University
Health Sciences Center (Shreveport, LA).

Data analysis
All experiments were repeated 2 or 3 times. Data
are expressed as mean ± SD. Two-tailed Student’s t tests
and ANOVA tests were used to compare the continuous
variables in groups, using the Prism v5 program
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All p<0.05 comparisons were
regarded as statistically significant.

ESI/MS/MS analysis of ceramides
Speciation of endogenous sphingolipids was
accomplished with a Thermo-Fisher TSQ Quantum
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operated in
a Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) positive
ionization mode, as described previously [33, 62,
63]. Total cells, fortified with internal standards, were
extracted with ethyl acetate/isopropanol/water (60/30/10
v/v). These extracts were evaporated to dryness, and
reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol. Portions of the
reconstituted samples were injected on the Surveyor/
TSQ Quantum LC/MS system, and gradient-eluted from
the BDS Hypersil C8 column (150 × 3.2 mm, 3 μm)
with a 1.0 mM methanolic ammonium formate/2 mM
aqueous ammonium formated mobile phase system. The
peaks for the target analytes and internal standards were
identified and processed using the Xcalibur software.
Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak
area ratios of synthetic standards, representing each
target analyte, to the corresponding internal standard.
Concentrations for samples were obtained from these
calibration curves by linear regression, and cellular
sphingolipids levels calculated by normalization against
total cellular protein.
