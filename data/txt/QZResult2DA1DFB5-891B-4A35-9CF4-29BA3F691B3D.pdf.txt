AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) Enhances the
Antitumor Activity of Rapamycin in Mouse
Models of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hung Huynh, PhD

BACKGROUND: The protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) and mitogen activated
protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways
have been shown to play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and angiogenesis, suggesting
that inhibition of these pathways may have therapeutic potential. METHODS: We treated patient-derived HCC xenografts with 1) mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA); 2) MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886); and 3) AZD6244 plus
RAPA (AZD6244/RAPA). Western blotting was used to determine pharmacodynamic changes in biomarkers relevant
to angiogenesis, mTOR pathway, and MEK signaling. Apoptosis, microvessel density, and cell proliferation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We report here that pharmacological inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway
by AZD6244 enhanced the antitumor and antiangiogenic activities of mTOR inhibitor RAPA in both orthotopic and
ectopic models of HCC. Such inhibition led to increased apoptosis, decreased angiogenesis and cell proliferation,
reduced expression of positive cell cycle regulators, and increase in proapoptotic protein Bim. CONCLUSIONS: Our
findings indicate that the AZD6244/RAPA combination had antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in preclinical models of human HCC. Given the urgent need for effective therapies in HCC, clinical evaluating AZD6244/RAPA combinaC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide.1 Surgical resection, percutaneous

ablation, and liver transplantation are the only potentially curative therapies for this disease; however, <20% of patients
with HCC can undergo surgery because of poor liver function and advanced disease.2-3 Of those having surgery, the 5year survival rate is limited to 25% to 50%. Recurrence, metastasis, and the development of new primary tumors are the
most common causes of mortality for patients with HCC.4-6 Until the advent of sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer and Onyx
Pharmaceuticals), patients with advanced HCC had limited treatment options. Given the increasing incidence of the disease around the world,7 newly effective treatments for advanced HCC are needed.
The rat sarcoma-activated factor (raf)/mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase kinase/
extracellular regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathways are among the most critical cellular signaling pathways that
support hepatocarcinogenesis.8-9 Although Raf-activating mutations were relatively rare events in HCC, Raf kinase was
activated in a high percentage of HCC tumors.10 HBV or HCV infection or mitogenic growth factors could activate
the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway10-11 and its activation was associated with aggressive tumor behavior.12 Preclinical studies
have shown that MEK/ERK inhibition resulted in suppressing HCC growth.13-15 It has been reported that the PIK3CA
gene was mutated16 and PTEN was inactivated in high proportion of HCC.17 These led to activation of Akt kinase and
the mTOR pathway.17 In HCC, total p70S6K expression was positively correlated with tumor grade, and inversely correlated with tumor size.18 We recently reported that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by RAD00119 or rapamycin/bevacizumab combination resulted in tumor growth inhibition.20 Furthermore, the 26-1004 line, which had a 16 bp

deletion in exon 8 of the PTEN gene was more sensitive
to rapamycin than other xenograft lines. Although complete remission of lung metastases was observed in a
patient on rapamycin after a liver transplant for metastatic HCC21 and tumor-free survival was also noted in
another HCC patient given rapamycin after a liver transplant,22 rapamycin clinical trials have turned out to be
less successful than expected. A potential mechanism of
resistance to mTORC1 inhibitors came about by the discovery of a negative feedback loop in which mTORC1
inhibition led to Akt activation23 or activation of the
ERK cascade.24 These observations formed the basis for
our hypothesis that targeting the mTOR and ERK pathways in combination would be effective for inhibiting
tumorigenicity in HCC.
In the present study, we investigated the consequences of combinational inhibition of the mTOR and MEK/
ERK signaling pathways.

This study received ethics board approval at the
National Cancer Centre Singapore and Singapore General Hospital. All mice were maintained according to the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health.
Primary HCCs have previously been used to create
xenograft lines.19-20,25 The following 5 lines (01-0207,
06-0606, 26-1004, 25-0705A, and 5-1318) were used to
establish tumors in male severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice (Animal Resources Centre,
Canning Vale, Western Australia) aged 9 to 10 weeks.
To investigate the antitumor effects of AZD6244
(AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, UK), rapamy-

cin (RAPA), and AZD6244 plus RAPA, mice bearing
indicated tumors (14 per group) were orally administered
daily either 200 lL of vehicle, or 25 mg/kg AZD6244,
1 mg/kg RAPA, or RAPA plus AZD6244 for 16 days
starting from day 7 after tumor implantation. By
this time, the tumors reached the size of approximately
100 mm3. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volume calculated as described.19 At the end of the study, the
mice were sacrificed with body and tumor weights being
recorded, and the tumors harvested for analysis.
In Vivo Orthotopic HCC Model
To create an orthotopic model of human HCC, mice
were anesthetized with a Ketamine/Diazepam solution
(50 mg/kg Ketamine hydrochloride, Rotexmedica, Trittau, Germany, and 5 mg/kg Diazepam, Alantic, I.M.).
Liver was exposed after an upper-middle incision. Tumor
fragments (containing approximately 5  106 cells in 30
lL medium-Matrigel mixture) were implanted into the
lobe of the liver by means of a 0.9  38 mm needle
(20G11=2TW, Becton Dickingson) and calibrated pushbutton syringe. The incision was closed using a running
suture of 5-0 silk. All mice developed tumors within 7 to
10 days of tumor tissue injection and grew rapidly thereafter. Upon tumor establishment, mice (5-8 per group)
were allocated to the following groups: 1) control (vehicle
only), 2) AZD6244 (25 mg/kg/day, orally), 3) RAPA (1
mg/kg/day, orally), and 4) AZD6244 /RAPA. They were
treated for 16 days.
Western Blot Analysis
Three to 4 independent tumors per group were homogenized. Eighty lg of total proteins per sample were subjected to Western blotting according to standard
protocols.19,25 Blots were incubated with indicated primary antibodies and 1:7500 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. All primary antibodies were
used at a final concentration of 1 lg/mL. The blots were
then observed with a chemiluminescent detection system
(Amersham).
Immunohistochemistry
Microvessel density, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were
assessed by immunohistochemistry as described.19-20 For
apoptosis and cell proliferation assessment, the number of
cleaved PARP-positive and Ki-67-positive cells among at
least 500 cells per region was counted and then expressed
as percentage values. For the quantification of mean vessel
density in sections stained for CD31, 10 random 0.159

mm2 fields at 100 magnification were captured for each
tumor and microvessels were quantified.
Determination of Plasma Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor Receptor
Animals were sacrificed on Day 16 after treatment and
approximately 500-800 lL of blood were collected per
mouse. The concentration of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGF) in the plasma was measured using
Endogen Human VEGF ELISA kits (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The sensitivity for VEGF kits is <8.0 pg/mL.
Statistical Analysis
Body weight at sacrifice, final mean weight of tumors,
plasma VEGF, mean vessel density, Ki-67 index, and percentage of cleaved PARP-positive cells were analyzed by
Student t test. For all statistical analyses, significance was
established at P < .05.

RESULTS
Our previous studies showed that the MEK/ERK27 and
mTOR19-20 signaling pathways were activated in HCC.
In addition, mTORC1 inhibition by RAD001 led to activation of the ERK cascade in RAD001-treated tumors.24
On the basis of the above-mentioned information, we
hypothesized that targeted inhibition of the mTOR and
ERK signaling pathways would inhibit HCC growth.
Therefore, we developed experimental paradigms to test
the consequences of inhibiting these pathways in orthotopic and ectopic models of human HCC. To achieve inhibition of ERK signaling, we used AZD6244, the MAP
kinase 1 (MEK) inhibitor already being characterized in
preclinical studies of HCC.14-15 Although the efficacy of
rapalogs as single agents may be limited, RAPA is particularly suitable for use in combination therapy. For the preclinical studies, we chose to use RAPA (rather than 1 of
the new derivatives), because it has been used in patients
with HCC,21-22 is commercially available, and, therefore,
logically more feasible to use in combination with
AZD6244. We used phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (phospho-S6R) and/or phospho-4EBP1 Thr70, as
indicators of the mTOR pathway activity and phosphorylated ERK (phospho-ERK) as an indicator of MEK activity. Figure 1 shows that oral delivery of 1 mg/kg of
RAPA or 25 mg/kg AZD6244 was sufficient to inhibit
the phosphorylation of mTOR targets (S6R and 4EBP1)
and ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204, respectively, confirming
our previous reports.14-15,20 Therefore, we implemented a

Mice bearing 01-0207 tumors (14 mice/group) were treated
with vehicle or indicated dose of RAPA or AZD6244 by gavage daily for 16 days. Lysates from vehicle-treated and

described in the Materials and Methods section. Blots were

once-daily dosing schedule using 1 mg/kg of RAPA and
25 mg/kg of AZD6244 for subsequent studies.
To investigate the effects of AZD6244/RAPA combination on the growth of HCC xenografts grown in
SCID mice, cohort groups that comprised mice bearing
06-0606, 25-0705A, 01-0207, or 26-1004 tumors were
randomly assigned to receive vehicle, or single agents
(RAPA or AZD6244), or the combination therapy daily
for 16 days. Our previous studies showed that the mTOR
and MEK/ERK pathways in these xenograft lines were relatively active.14-15,19-20 Therapy initiated after tumor
establishment (approximately 100 mm3) and lasted for 16
days. Although AZD6244 modestly inhibited the growth
rate of all 4 lines at each following up time point (Fig. 2AD), RAPA significantly suppressed the growth rate of 250705A, 26-1004, and 01-0207 lines (P < .05) but not
06-0606. AZD6244/RAPA was markedly inhibitory
compared with control or single agents (P < .001).

Figure 2. Illustrated are effects of AZD6244, RAPA, and AZD6244/RAPA on the growth rate of patient-derived HCC xenografts.
Mice bearing 06-0606, 01-0207, 26-1004, and 25-0705A tumors (14 mice/group) were treated with vehicle, AZD6244 (25 mg/
kg/day), RAPA (1 mg/kg/day), or AZD6244/RAPA for 16 days, as described in the Materials and Methods section. (A) Mean tumor volume at given time points for lines 01-0207, (B) 06-0606, (C) 26-1004, and (D) 25-0705A are shown. Data were expressed
as the mean  SD. Experiments were repeated twice with similar results.

Although AZD6244 modestly reduced final mean weight
of tumors, RAPA significantly decreased it compared with
control (Table 1; P < .05), which is in agreement with the
growth rate results. However, AZD6244/RAPA showed
significant reduction in tumor weight when compared
with AZD6244 or RAPA alone (Table 1, P < .01). Efficacy of AZD6244/RAPA was further evaluated by comparing the final mean weight of tumors in the drugtreated study arm (T) to that of the control study arm (C).
The T/C ratio with a value of <0.42 was considered an
active response (Drug Evaluation Branch of the Division
of Cancer Treatment, NCI criteria). As shown in Table 1,
the T/C values less than 0.21 were observed in all 4 lines
treated with AZD6244/RAPA for 16 days, suggesting
that this combination was quite active. The treatments

1318

were well-tolerated and produced minimal toxicity as
determined by body weight loss (Table 1).
Because mTOR activation was important for VEGF
expression28 and RAPA inhibited tumor growth through
antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of
VEGF,29 we determined the levels of plasma VEGF in 4
treatment arms by ELISA. As shown in Table 1, VEGF
levels in the plasma derived from RAPA-treated animals
were significantly lower than those in the plasma derived
from vehicle-treated and AZD6244-treated mice (P <
.05). A more striking reduction in plasma VEGF was
observed in the AZD6244/RAPA combination. Taken together, these data suggest that combined blockade of the
mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways resulted in reduction in
plasma VEGF.

Mean microvessel density of 10 random 0.159 mm2 fields at 100 magnification.

Next, we evaluated representative tumor sections
from 4 treatment arms using immunohistochemistry.
Staining results for CD31 (a marker of angiogenesis), Ki67 (a marker for proliferation), and cleaved PARP (a
marker for apoptosis) for 4 treatments are shown in Table
1. RAPA alone and AZD6244/RAPA significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in all 4 lines studied compared with the control (Table 1; P < .01). Although
AZD6244 had insignificant effect on microvessel density
and cell proliferation, it significantly increased apoptosis
(P < .05). Interestingly, AZD6244/RAPA therapy
showed significant reduction in tumor cell proliferation,
microvessel density, and markedly increased apoptosis
when compared with control or AZD6244 alone (Table
1; P < .01). The results suggest that AZD6244 produced
a predominantly apoptotic effect with a minimal effect on
tumor cell proliferation, while RAPA inhibited tumor cell
proliferation with modestly antiangiogenesis.
To gain initial insights regarding the mechanistic
basis for the combinatorial effects of AZD6244/RAPA,
changes in the phosphorylation of key proteins in the
VEGFR-2, MEK/ERK, and mTOR pathways and cell
cycle regulators as well as apoptotic proteins in 01-0207

shows that while VEGFR-2 levels were not affected by

in AZD6244/RAPA-treated tumors was significantly
reduced (P < 0.05), indicating that VEGFR-2 activity
was reduced. AZD6244 and AZD6244/RAPA significantly inhibited phosphorylation of ERK at Thr202/
Tyr204 (P < .01). As expected, RAPA significantly
decreased the levels of phospho-p70S6K Thr389, phospho-4EBP1 Thr70, and phospho-S6R Ser235/236 (P <
.01), indicating that the mTOR pathway was inactivated.
Although AZD6244 modestly inhibited cdk-2 and cdc-2,
RAPA and AZD6244/RAPA induced significant reductions in the levels of p21, cdc-2, cyclin B1, cdk-2, and
phospho-Rb Ser780 and Ser807/811 (Fig. 3B; P < .01).
In addition, up-regulation of p27 and p130 Rb in RAPA
and AZD6244/RAPA-treated tumors was also observed,
suggesting that RAPA and AZD6244/RAPA caused cell
cycle arrest. Although AZD6244 alone significantly
increased the levels of Bim, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved
PARP (P < .01), elevation of these apoptotic markers was
most marked when the drugs were used in combination
(Fig. 3C). There were no significant alterations in expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
Puma, and Bad after either treatment (Fig. 3C). Similar
data were obtained when 06-0606, 25-0705A, and 261004 tumors were analyzed (data not shown). The results
suggest that AZD6244/RAPA induced apoptosis probably through Bim-dependent mechanisms.

repeated twice with similar results.

In orthotopic HCC models, all mice developed
tumors within 7 to 10 days of tumor tissue injection and
grew rapidly thereafter. By using this model, we conducted
the 4-arm therapeutic study to compare the effect of
AZD6244, RAPA, and AZD6244/RAPA on the growth of
HCC xenografts. Figure 4A showed that AZD6244 had little antitumor activity against the 5-1318 and 25-0705A
lines. The antineoplastic activity of RAPA was higher than
that of AZD6244, and the antitumor effect of the combination was superior to that of either AZD6244 or RAPA alone.
We next investigated the phosphorylation status of
the mTOR targets and ERK pathway as well as apoptotic
markers in 5-1318 tumors. As shown in Figure 4B, RAPA
and AZD6244/RAPA induced significant reductions in
the levels of phospho-p70S6K Thr389, phospho-S6R
Ser235/236, and phospho-4EBP1 Thr70 (P < .001),
confirming that the mTOR pathway was inactivated. As
expected, AZD6244 alone and AZD6244/RAPA suppressed phosphorylation of ERK at Thr202/Tyr204.
Although AZD6244 alone increased the levels of Bim and

cleaved PARP, elevation of these apoptotic markers was
most marked when the drugs were used in combination
(Fig. 4B). Similar data were obtained when 25-0705A
tumors were analyzed (data not shown).
Next, we evaluated representative tumor sections from
4 treatment arms using immunohistochemistry. Representative staining results for phospho-S6R Ser235/236, CD31,
Ki-67, and cleaved PARP are shown in Figure 5. RAPA alone
and AZD6244/RAPA reduced phospho-S6R Ser235/236,
blood vessel density, and Ki-67 positive cells compared with
control (Fig. 5 and Table 2, P < .01). In addition, apoptosis
(cleaved PARP positive cells) was observed in RAPA/
AZD6244-treated tumors, and this was markedly increased
in the combination compared with RAPA and AZD6244
alone (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The results suggest that
AZD6244 produced a predominantly apoptotic effect with a
minimal effect on proliferation, while RAPA was predominantly cytostatic, with mild antiangiogenic inhibition and
modest apoptotic induction. Interestingly, combination therapy resulted in decreased proliferation, inhibition of

DISCUSSION
HCC is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide.1
Although several new chemotherapies have been explored
and refined in the last decade, the mortality rate due to
HCC remains unchanged. New therapeutic strategies for
this disease are urgently needed. Although many drugs demonstrated preclinical positive results, only some of them are
likely to move forward to phase 2 clinical trials.30 One of
the challenges the investigators face in preclinical testing of
Cancer

targeted drugs in HCC is the lack of models that recapitulate the human disease. We previously reported the establishment of patient-derived xenografts from HCC
tumors.25 We showed that these xenografts exhibit cellular
and tissue characteristics that resemble the original tumors,
and certain therapies merit further investigation in clinical
trials.15,19-20,26 One disadvantage of the ectopic xenograft
model is that the site of implantation does not reproduce
the tumor microenvironment. To circumvent this disadvantage, intact fragments of human HCC tumors are
implanted into the liver of immunodeficient mice to create
surgical orthotopic models. These orthotopic models of
human HCC may serve as better tools for studying HCC
drug-targeting processes, particularly with respect to

modeling tumor host interactions, angiogenesis, and invasion, and may, therefore, more closely represent clinical disease. In the present study, we use both ectopic and
orthotopic models of human HCC to define the functional
significance of combinatorial inhibition of the mTOR and
MEK/ERK pathways for HCC tumorigenicity.
We previously reported that the mTOR20 and
MEK/ERK27 signaling pathways are over-expressed in
HCC. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize that
combinatorial inhibition of these pathways would be
effective for the treatment of HCC. We now demonstrate
that inhibition of the mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling
pathways leads to inhibition of tumor growth, reduction
in cellular proliferation, suppression of angiogenesis, and
increase in apoptosis in both orthotopic and ectopic models of human HCC. Five lines tested have sustained tumor
growth inhibition after treatment with AZD6244/RAPA
combination. Our observations are in agreement with a
recent study by Waugh Kinkade and colleagues, who
report that MEK inhibitor PD0325901 plus RAPA synergistically inhibits growth and cell proliferation in androgen-independent and refractory prostate tumors.31
Because HCC is a vascular tissue and one third of HCCs
are driven by proliferative signals generated from tyrosine
receptor kinases (RTK), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, and PI-3K/
Akt/mTOR pathways,32-33 the described antitumor and
antiangiogenic activities of the AZD6244/RAPA support
further investigation of this combination in clinical trials.
Although AZD6244/RAPA inhibits tumor growth
in preclinical HCC models, the molecular mechanisms
for the crosstalk between RAPA and AZD6244 are not
known. It has been proposed that mTORC1 inhibition
increases RTK/IRS-1/PI3K activity toward Ras/MAPK,
therefore, promoting both Akt activation and ERK phosphorylation in what comprises a dual feedback mechanism.24,34 In the present study, we observe that MEK
inhibition results in elevation of phospho-Akt Ser 473,
which is upstream of the mTOR pathway. Despite the observation of up-regulation of phospho-Akt, phosphorylation of 4EBP1, p70S6K, and S6 ribosomal protein
remains unchanged (Fig. 3A). The mechanism(s) responsible for this effect remains to be determined.
In this study, we observe that AZD6244/RAPA is
more effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis than either agent alone. These effects are
associated with dephosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein and p110 Rb, reduction in the expression of positive
cell cycle regulators, and increase in proapoptotic protein
Bim. In addition, the expression of p27 and p130 Rb was

Cancer

March 1, 2010

also significantly elevated in response to RAPA and
AZD6244/RAPA therapies. It is possible that elevation of
p130 Rb and p27 coupled with decreased expression of
cdk-2, cdk-6, and dephosphorylation of Rb lead to G1
cell cycle arrest. In the present study, phospho-S6R is
reproducibly suppressed by RAPA and AZD6244/RAPA
in all xenografts tested, pointing to a mechanism that perturbs formation of the preinitiation complex, which may,
in turn, alter translation efficiencies of many mRNAs that
regulate cell proliferation. Support of this hypothesis in a
previous study35 showed that the conditionally deleted S6
gene in adult liver results in failure of cell proliferation after partial hepatectomy. Up-regulation of the proapoptotic regulator Bim by AZD6244/RAPA may also
contribute to its apoptotic activity. Particular functions
for Bim have been described in the regulation of apoptosis
associated with thymocyte negative selection and after
growth factor withdrawal, during which Bim expression is
elevated.36-38 It is possible that up-regulation of Bim by
AZD6244 and AZD6244/RAPA allows more Bim to
bind to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thereby antagonizing their antiapoptotic activities, leading to Bax-dependent apoptogen
release, caspase activation, and cell death.
In this study, RAPA and AZD6244/RAPA reduce
circulating VEGF concentrations possibly as a reflection
of their effect on tumor size. Changes in plasma VEGF
cannot distinguish between a blockade of VEGF production by the tumor tissue, which is the source of VEGF or a
combination of reduced VEGF production and small tumor size, but the data suggest that plasma VEGF may be a
useful marker of efficacy as recently described for the
VEGF antibody bevacizumab.39 Because VEGF is an
angiogenic, proliferation, and survival factor for vascular
endothelial cells and is produced by both cancer cells and
stromal cells, creating a microenvironment favorable for
tumor growth,40 decrease in plasma VEGF and probably
tumor VEGF by RAPA and AZD6244/RAPA, would inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and promote endothelial cell death, leading to decreased tumor microvessel
density. Consistent with this hypothesis, RAD001 has
recently been shown to inhibit tumor vascularization
directly via endothelial and smooth muscle cells and pericytes, and indirectly via VEGF production.19,41
In summary, our present study provides the evidence
that AZD6244/RAPA combination is more effective in suppressing HCC tumor growth, inhibiting angiogenesis and
cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis than either agent
alone. Our findings and others31 exemplify how the efficacy
of MEK or mTOR inhibitors can be improved in clinics
