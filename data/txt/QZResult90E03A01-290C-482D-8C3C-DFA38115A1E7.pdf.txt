Abstract
To study the immune response to prostate cancer, we
developed an autochthonous animal model based on the
transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP)
mouse in which spontaneously developing tumors express
influenza hemagglutinin as a unique, tumor-associated
antigen. Our prior studies in these animals showed immunologic tolerance to hemagglutinin, mirroring the clinical
situation in patients with cancer who are generally nonresponsive to their disease. We used this physiologically relevant
animal model to assess the immunomodulatory effects of
cyclophosphamide when administered in combination with
an allogeneic, cell-based granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor–secreting cancer immunotherapy. Through
adoptive transfer of prostate/prostate cancer–specific CD8
T cells as well as through studies of the endogenous T-cell
repertoire, we found that cyclophosphamide induced a
marked augmentation of the antitumor immune response.
This effect was strongly dependent on both the dose and
the timing of cyclophosphamide administration. Mechanistic
studies showed that immune augmentation by cyclophosphamide was associated with a transient depletion of regulatory
T cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes but not in the
peripheral circulation. Interestingly, we also noted effects on
dendritic cell phenotype; low-dose cyclophosphamide was
associated with increased expression of dendritic cell maturation markers. Taken together, these data clarify the dose,
timing, and mechanism of action by which immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide can be translated to a clinical setting
in a combinatorial cancer treatment strategy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Multiple immunotherapy strategies for prostate cancer are
currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation, and several of
these have advanced to the point of phase II or III trials (1–6). One
of these strategies involves administration of irradiated, allogeneic
tumor cells genetically modified to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; ref. 7). This platform,

known as GVAX (GM-CSF immunotherapy for cancer), appears to
function via the secretion of GM-CSF by the modified tumor cells,
which serves to recruit dendritic cells (DC) to the immunization
site where they take up and process tumor antigens. Through the
process known as cross-presentation, tumor antigens are then
processed and presented to T cells by host antigen-presenting
cells (8), potentially initiating an antitumor immune response.
Counteracting these immunotherapy strategies are a host of
mechanisms by which evolving tumors escape immune recognition. Although considerable progress has been made toward
understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion, T-cell tolerance to tumor-associated antigens appears to play a considerable
role (8–11). To maximize the potential of cancer immunotherapy,
it has been postulated that immune activation (‘‘immunization’’)
will need to be combined with interventions designed to subvert
the tolerogenic processes in tumor-bearing hosts (12). One
relatively simple intervention by which the immune response to
cancer immunotherapy may be augmented is through administration of low doses of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (13).
This combination therapy has a long translational history, with
initial studies done in the 1970s (14), and translation to the clinical
setting by several groups (15, 16). Cyclophosphamide has been
postulated to function in this setting through the depletion of Treg
(13), a population of CD4+ T cells that serves to down-modulate an
antitumor immune response in vivo (17–19).
The doses of cyclophosphamide used to augment an antitumor
immune response are generally substantially lower than those used
in standard clinical regimens, which are immunosuppressive by
virtue of lymphodepletion. In addition, the relative timing of
cyclophosphamide and the tumor immunotherapy under study is
critical, as administration of the drug after immunization appears
to dramatically impair immunotherapy response (13). However,
the majority of these preclinical studies were done using models
involving implanted tumor cells, a system that may or may not
mimic the immune response to tumors in humans, as clinically
relevant disease in patients may have evolved slowly over years.
To more closely model the interaction between cell-based
antitumor immunotherapy and administration of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide, we used a murine system based on the
transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP)
model, in which metastatic tumors arise progressively with age
(20). By mating TRAMP mice with analogous transgenic mice that
expresses the model antigen hemagglutinin (HA) in a prostaterestricted manner (ProHA; ref. 21), we created a model to study the
immune response to tissue-tumor restricted HA as a function of
immunotherapy and/or cyclophosphamide administration. As
described herein, our results are broadly consistent with previous

data but suggest that a dose of cyclophosphamide lower than
previously reported may be sufficient to augment antitumor
responses. We also report novel data supporting a role for
cyclophosphamide in multiple dosing regimens, showing that
low-dose cyclophosphamide can be given before each immunization. In addition to a treatment benefit from the combined
regimen, we also investigate the mechanism of action, showing that
cyclophosphamide alters the cell surface phenotype of antigenpresenting cells at the immunization site in addition to depleting
Treg at the tumor site.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Clone 4 is a CD8 TCR transgenic mouse recognizing (542IYSTVASSL550) in a Kd-restricted manner (22). Clone 4 mice were backcrossed
over 12 generations onto a Thy1.1 congenic B10.D2 background. ProHA
transgenic mice express secreted HA under control of the prostate
epithelial-specific Probasin promoter (21) and are on a B10.D2 background.
Double transgenic (ProHA  TRAMP) mice were generated by backcrossing
TRAMP animals onto the ProHA background >12 generations. Double
transgenic animals develop autochthonous prostate tumors expressing HA
as a tissue/tumor-restricted antigen. Nontransgenic B10.D2 (H-2d) mice
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mouse care and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University under an approved
protocol.
Cell lines. TRAMP-C2 was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and maintained in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5%
NuSerum (Becton Dickinson), 10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone (Sigma),
and 5 Ag/mL insulin (Sigma). B78H1-GM is a GM-CSF-secreting line (23),
which has been described previously (24). These cells secrete f2,500 ng
GM-CSF/106 cells/24 h as determined by ELISA. To model HA-targeted
immunotherapy, TRAMP-C2 cells were transfected with full-length HA as
described previously (25), using Lipofectamine, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Transfectants were cloned by limiting
dilution and HA expression was confirmed by staining with the HA-specific
monoclonal antibody H18L10-5R1 (26), a gift of Dr. J. Yewdell. A single clone
expressing high levels of HA was selected, expanded, and used in further
studies.
Chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide was purchased from Bristol-Myers
Squibb and diluted in PBS for intraperitoneal injection.
Adoptive T-cell transfer. Adoptive T-cell transfer was done as described
previously (27). Donor TCR transgenic mice were euthanized via CO2
asphyxiation. Spleens and lymph nodes were collected and homogenized,
and RBC were lysed. CD8 T cells were purified using Miltenyi beads
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For some experiments, purified
cells were labeled for 8 min with CFSE (Invitrogen) by adding 0.5 AL of
5 mmol/L stock per 1 mL cells. After labeling, cells were washed twice and
resuspended in HBSS for intravenous injections. Cells (2.5  106) were
injected per mouse in 0.2 mL total volume by tail vein injection.
Bystander immunotherapy (T-GVAX). To model GVAX immunotherapy using bystander cells, 1  106 TRAMP-C2HA cells were admixed with
5  104 B78H1-GM cells and irradiated (5,000 rad). After washing thrice in
HBSS, cells were resuspended in a total of 200 AL HBSS and administered by
subcutaneous injection of 100 AL into each hind limb.
Flow cytometry. Prostate glands, prostate draining lymph nodes (DLN),
and spleens were harvested on indicated days and single-cell suspensions
were prepared. All staining reagents were from BD Pharmingen, with the
exception of FoxP3 (eBioscience). After 10 min incubation, samples were
washed once in PBS + 1% fetal bovine serum solution and analyzed using a
FACSCalibur instrument (BD). Intracellular cytokine analysis was done as
described previously (21, 27). Data were analyzed using the FlowJo software
package (Treestar).
In vivo CTL assay. This assay was done as described previously (28).
Splenocytes from naive B10.D2 mice were labeled with 2.5 or 0.25 Amol/L
CFSE (Molecular Probes). CFSE-labeled cells (2.5 Amol/L) were loaded with

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

HA class I peptide (2 Amol/L), whereas CFSE-labeled cells (0.25 Amol/L) were
used as a negative control. Target cells were transferred intravenously (7.5 
106 cells of each population) into indicated groups of mice. Eighteen hours
later, lymphocytes were isolated from spleen and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis was done. Histogram plots were used to determine the
percentage of each target population based on intensity of CFSE staining.
Percentage specific killing was calculated as described previously (29).
Treatment studies. Treatment was initiated at ages 7 to 9 weeks
corresponding to an early intervention protocol (30). To model multiple
treatments, immunization was repeated three additional times, 1 week
apart. Mice were euthanized at ages 17 to 19 weeks. The urogenital organs
were microdissected under a stereomicroscope and weighed. Ventral
prostate lobes were removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
followed by 70% ethanol before paraffin embedding. Four micron sections
were cut using a cryostat and placed onto poly-lysine-coated slides. Tissues
were processed and stained with H&E, and tumor tissues were graded in a
blinded manner by two individual pathologists as described previously
(see Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 27). Tumor tissues were also staged
according to the extent of involvement: 1, focal; 2, multifocal; and 3, diffuse.
Tumor score was calculated by tumor grade  tumor extent.
Lymphocyte counts. The TruCount system was used to quantify
leukocytes according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD). Directly
conjugated monoclonal antibodies were added to TruCount tubes as
follows: Lin cocktail, CD8-FITC, CD19-PE, CD4-APC, and CD45-PerCP.
Anticoagulated whole peripheral blood (50 AL) was added to 450 AL FACS
Lysing Solution, admixed, and added to tubes. Flow cytometry was done
using a FACSCalibur instrument; absolute leukocyte count was calculated
as (number of events in cell count region  number of beads per test) /
(number of events in absolute bead count region  test volume).
In vitro suppression assay. These assays were done as described
previously (31), and 3.5  104 purified T cells (responders) were admixed
with increasing numbers of CD4+CD25+ T cells (suppressors) isolated from
treated mice. Cells were incubated in round-bottomed 96-well tissue culture
plates in 200 AL CTL medium. Forty-eight to 72 hours later, cultures were
pulsed with 1 ACi [3H]thymidine and incubated an additional 16 h before
harvest with a Packard Micromate cell harvester followed by counting with
a Packard Matrix 96 direct h counter (Packard Biosciences).
Statistical analyses. Unless otherwise indicated, each experiment
was done in triplicate using a minimum of five animals per group;
representative results are shown. Mean F SE is shown. For comparisons
between groups, the one-way ANOVA with post-test comparison was done.
Differences were considered statistically significant when the P < 0.05.
Calculations were done using the GraphPad PRISM package (GraphPad).

Results
Tolerance to GVAX in tumor-bearing ProHA  TRAMP mice.
To model allogeneic prostate GVAX immunotherapy (7), we used
the TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cell line established from TRAMP
mice (32), which is allogeneic with respect to the treated animals.
TRAMP-C2 cells were transfected with full-length HA and HA
expression was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(Fig. 1A). For immunotherapy studies, this cell line (TRAMP-C2HA)
was used in combination with a GM-CSF–secreting bystander cell
line (B78H1-GM) as described previously (24). In vivo efficacy of
this immunotherapy was confirmed in nontransgenic mice by
adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled HA-specific CD8 T cells followed
by immunization. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, T-GVAX immunotherapy resulted in robust CD8 T-cell division, with a peak in
division f7 days postadministration. Intracellular staining confirmed that adoptively transferred HA-specific CD8 T cells
responding to T-GVAX developed an effector phenotype; nearly
all of the HA-specific divided cells in nontransgenic B10.D2 mice
produced IFN-g as assayed by intracellular staining (Fig. 1D).
However, when identical cells were adoptively transferred to

tumor-bearing ProHA  TRAMP mice, neither expansion nor
cytokine production were detected following T-GVAX administration, consistent with our previous data showing tolerance to HA
in these animals (21) as well as with data from other groups
showing T-cell tolerance in mice with autochthonous prostate
tumors (33–36).
Timing and dosage of cyclophosphamide to augment TGVAX function. Because a single T-GVAX treatment was not
sufficient to expand or induce an effector phenotype in prostate/
prostate cancer–specific CD8 T cells transferred to tumor-bearing
mice, we tested whether the addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide could affect T-cell tolerance in this model. Because previous
studies showed that the timing of cyclophosphamide administration was critical (13), we varied the temporal relationship between
cyclophosphamide and T-GVAX administration as shown in Fig. 2A
and B. In initial studies, treatment was initiated after a 24 h in vivo
rest, and function was assayed at a fixed (7 day) interval after
T-GVAX immunotherapy. As shown in Fig. 2A, cyclophosphamide
appeared to significantly augment T-GVAX–mediated CD8 T-cell
expansion when given before immunotherapy administration.
We further explored the relative timing of cyclophosphamide and
T-GVAX using a second experimental design in which CD8 T cells
remained in vivo for a fixed period in all experimental groups
(Fig. 2B). This second set of studies confirmed the first, suggesting
that a maximal organ-specific CD8 effector response occurred
when cyclophosphamide is administered 1 day before T-GVAX.

www.aacrjournals.org

Given the presumably localized activity of effector CD8 T cells, we
chose to administer cyclophosphamide at day 1 for further
studies. We next explored the dose of cyclophosphamide used to
augment CD8 T-cell number and function in tumor-bearing
animals. As shown in Fig. 3A, an intraperitoneal dose of 50 mg/
kg was optimal in this regard, with differences in specific T-cell
expansion and effector phenotype most apparent in the prostate
gland itself. Compared with either T-GVAX or cyclophosphamide
alone, these results were significant, with nearly an order of
magnitude increase in the number of HA-specific CD8 T cells in
both the prostate and the prostate DLN (Fig. 3B and C). Similar
increases in tumor necrosis factor-a, granzyme B, and perforin
secretion were noted with the combined treatment regimen as well
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide was not effective in this regard (data not shown). As
metabolism of pharmacologic agents can be different in the mouse
compared with the human, we determined the biological effects of
these low doses of cyclophosphamide in terms of lymphocyte
counts using TruCount technology. As shown in Fig. 3D, the lower
doses of cyclophosphamide that were effective in terms of
increasing effector CD8 T-cell expansion did not result in significant
depletion of either CD8 or CD4 T cells from the peripheral
circulation. Interestingly, there was a fairly sharp demarcation in
this regard, with doses >100 mg/kg showing relatively prolonged
T-cell depletion in these mice. In addition, the optimal dose of
cyclophosphamide in terms of T-cell expansion (50 mg/kg) resulted

in a significant reduction in the number of circulating B cells,
possibly consistent with prior studies suggesting a potential role
for B cells in mediating tolerance in certain models (37).
Cyclophosphamide in multidose treatment regimens. Because induction of an antitumor immune response typically
requires multiple treatments (38), we examined the effects of
combining cyclophosphamide with T-GVAX in multidose regimens.
For these longer-term studies, the lifespan of adoptively transferred
HA-specific CD8 T cells might prove limiting, as such cells are
gradually eliminated in a tolerogenic environment (39). Thus, we
chose initially to evaluate the function of the endogenous immune
repertoire using an in vivo CTL as a readout (29). We first tested
whether T-GVAX immunization could be boosted at a 1- or 2-week
interval (Fig. 4A). These experiments were done in both nontransgenic (B10.D2) mice and 18- to 20-week-old tumor-bearing
ProHA  TRAMP mice. In mice without autochthonous tumors,
boosting at a 2-week interval proved optimal (Fig. 4A). However,
this was not the case for tumor-bearing animals, where weekly
immunotherapy resulted in a greater CTL response in vivo. Because
this shorter interval was well within the expected persistence of
adoptively transferred prostate/prostate-tumor specific CD8 T cells,
we returned to the more sensitive adoptive transfer system to
determine whether cyclophosphamide should be administered
with each immunotherapy dose (Fig. 4B). To our surprise, the
addition of low-dose (50 mg/kg) cyclophosphamide to both prime
and boost immunotherapy doses resulted in maximal persistence
of adoptively transferred CD8 T cells (Fig. 4B and C). The effects of
ongoing tolerogenic processes were notable, as a lower percentage
of adoptively transferred T cells secreted IFN-g at this later time
point. Despite this, the number of prostate/prostate cancer-specific

effector cells was significantly increased when cyclophosphamide
was administered before each T-GVAX administration.
Combining T-GVAX with low-dose cyclophosphamide: treatment effects. To test for an additive antitumor effect of the
combined regimen, ProHA  TRAMP mice ages 7 to 9 weeks were
treated a total of four times with immunotherapy: (T-GVAX) alone,
cyclophosphamide alone, or the combination. Ten weeks after
initial treatment, animals were sacrificed and tumor extent was
evaluated as described previously (27). As shown in Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S2, the wet weight of the urogenital tract, a
gross surrogate for tumor burden (40), was significantly decreased
in the combination treatment group compared with either single
treatment alone. T-GVAX immunotherapy alone had no treatment
effect in this autochthonous model, whereas cyclophosphamide
alone showed a nonsignificant trend toward efficacy compared
with untreated control animals. Blinded scoring of the microdissected ventral lobe of the prostate gland corroborated these
data, again showing a significant decrease in tumor score in the
combined treatment group compared with either single treatment
alone (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, lymphocytic infiltration and apoptotic
bodies were more frequently noted in the combined treatment
group (Fig. 5C).
Mechanism of combined treatment effect. Early studies
suggested that the immunomodulatory effects of low-dose
cyclophosphamide were mediated through the depletion of
regulatory T cells (Treg; ref. 41). We thus quantified Treg in the
various sites in tumor-bearing ProHA  TRAMP mice ages 16 to
18 weeks following treatment with low-dose T-GVAX + cyclophosphamide. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, a relative Treg depletion was
noted at the tumor site (prostate gland), but not in the spleen,

which more closely approximates the peripheral circulation. The
prostate DLN also showed a relative Treg depletion, but this effect
was transient, with relative Treg infiltration returning to normal
levels by day +7 posttreatment. Decreased absolute numbers of
Treg were also noted in the vaccine DLN. Treg depletion in these
studies did not appear to involve a selective induction of apoptosis
in this population, as increased Annexin-5 staining in Treg was not
noted after cyclophosphamide administration (Supplementary
Fig. S4). In addition to these quantitative effects, it was possible
that the treatment effect of cyclophosphamide could be mediated
by a relative decrease in Treg function as well as number. Thus, we

performed classic in vitro suppression assays using Treg sorted
from the spleen or prostate DLN 4 days post–cyclophosphamide
administration. As shown in Fig. 6C, Treg from both cyclophosphamide-treated and control animals mediated suppression
equally well in these studies, suggesting that the immune effects
of cyclophosphamide on Treg are mediated by decreases in Treg
number rather than by alterations in Treg function. Recent studies
suggested that treatment effects in mice treated with a combination of GVAX and anti-CTLA4 seemed to correlate with increases in
the ratio of effector cells to Treg (42). Thus, we evaluated the
relative ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ effectors to Treg under the various

treatment conditions. As shown in Fig. 6D, the combined treatment
resulted in an increase in the ratio of CD4+ or CD8+ effector T cells/
Treg in the prostate gland but not in the prostate DLN. The
combination of cyclophosphamide and T-GVAX also appeared to
have a significant effect in the Teff/Treg ration in the spleen,

suggesting a potential parameter for peripheral monitoring. In
addition to effects on Treg, low-dose cyclophosphamide may affect
either the number or the maturation state of DC, which serve as
antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, we examined the number and
cell surface phenotype of DC in various sites. We evaluated both

of three experiments. D, ratio Teff/Treg. CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells (IFN-g–positive) were quantified on day +14 following administration of T-GVAX +
cyclophosphamide, and compared with Treg, quantified using FoxP3+ intracellular staining as above. Three animals per group, representative of two experiments.

CD8+CD11c+ DC, the primary population involved in crosspresentation (43), and the CD8 population, which may present
antigen when activated (44). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5,
the combination of cyclophosphamide and T-GVAX appeared to
increase the number of CD8 DC in the prostate DLN compared
with T-GVAX alone, but the number of CD8 DC was decreased at
the vaccine DLN. Absolute numbers of CD8+ (cross-presenting) DC
were not increased with the combination treatment in any of the
sites examined. These data suggest that the combinatorial effect of
T-GVAX + low-dose cyclophosphamide are most likely not
mediated by dramatic changes in DC number. However, the
combination of cyclophosphamide and T-GVAX did appear to
induce a more proinflammatory DC phenotype in both CD8
(Supplementary Fig. S6) and CD8+ (Supplementary Fig. S7)
populations. Notably, a significant increase in the mean fluorescence intensity of class II MHC on CD8+ DC was noted in the
prostate DLN with the combination treatment compared with
T-GVAX alone (Supplementary Fig. S7). Taken together, these data
support the notion that depletion of Treg may be a major
mechanism of action of low-dose cyclophosphamide in this
combined treatment regimen but that a more proinflammatory
DC phenotype may contribute as well.

Discussion
In these studies, we evaluated the effects of adding low-dose
cyclophosphamide to a cell-based immunotherapy in mice bearing
endogenous prostate tumors. Although the immunomodulatory
effects of cyclophosphamide have been previously evaluated (13),
to our knowledge, these studies represent the first attempt to
understand this interaction in an autochthonous tumor model.
In terms of timing, our data provide strong confirmation of earlier
work, suggesting that administration of cyclophosphamide 1 or
2 days before GVAX immunotherapy treatment provides an optimal
effect. It should be noted that our studies were limited to a single
tumor immunotherapy modality (GVAX) and that the timing of
cyclophosphamide treatment relative to immunization may vary
with the immunotherapy construct employed. We also carefully
evaluated the relative dosage of cyclophosphamide required for a
combined treatment effect; our data suggest that the optimum
dose is slightly lower than previous data would indicate (13).
However, the cyclophosphamide dosage examined here (50 mg/kg
intraperitoneally) is within the range of earlier studies suggesting
an optimal dose of 100 mg/kg and may reflect slight differences
in immunotherapy potency in the models examined or potentially
differences in the models themselves.

Augmentation of Antitumor Immunity by Cyclophosphamide

We also evaluated the effects of combined treatment in a
multidose setting that more accurately resembles current clinical
treatment paradigms. To our knowledge, these data are novel
and suggest that low-dose cyclophosphamide treatment might
prove optimal when administered before each immunotherapy
dose. These data have important clinical implications and are
consistent with recently published data showing a cumulative
effect on Treg depletion over time in patients treated with oral
cyclophosphamide (5). Interestingly, others have been able to
detect decreases in Treg number in the periphery of treated
patients, an effect that does not seem to be mirrored in our
shorter-term animal studies, where we found that the effects of
low-dose cyclophosphamide on Treg number were relatively
confined to the tumor itself as well as to the tumor DLN. It
should be further noted that the effects of cyclophosphamide in
this model were achieved with intraperitoneal versus intravenous
administration. The mechanism behind this differential effect is
currently not known, but the efficacy of intraperitoneal administration (which involves multicompartment pharmacokinetics)
might support the concept of oral administration of cyclophosphamide to cancer patients as has been suggested by a recent
clinical trial (5).
We also evaluated the mechanism of action of low-dose
cyclophosphamide in this setting. As above, our results suggest
Treg depletion as a major mechanism. However, low-dose
cyclophosphamide alone did show a trend toward a treatment
effect in ProHA  TRAMP mice, suggesting either a direct antitumor effect or, perhaps more interestingly, an effect on Treg in
the absence of specific immunization. It should be noted that
separating a Treg-depleting effect from other possible mechanisms
of action is difficult, because available alterative strategies are
incapable of completely depleting Treg to provide an appropriate
control (45). To this end, we also studied the effects of low-dose
cyclophosphamide on DC number and function. Although the
numbers of CD8+ or CD8 DC were generally not increased by
combination treatment, both populations appeared to show an
increased mean fluorescence intensity of class II MHC in the

prostate DLN, consistent with a more activated DC phenotype.
These findings are consistent with recent studies suggesting that
Treg may function in vivo by altering DC phenotype (46).
In summary, these data provide strong experimental support for
a strategy combining low-dose cyclophosphamide with allogeneic
GVAX immunotherapy. This concept has a long history, with initial
studies combining a melanoma vaccine with cyclophosphamide
done in the 1980s (47). This combination has also been evaluated
with other cancer vaccines (48), and a recent study using GVAX
alone versus low-dose cyclophosphamide + GVAX in patients with
pancreatic cancer supports the clinical utility of our results (49).
Although the majority of such studies have used a fixed dose of
cyclophosphamide, a recent trial in women with breast cancer is
consistent with the data presented here; at increasing cyclophosphamide doses, combinatorial effects were lost (50). As such, our
data showing that small increases in cyclophosphamide dose can
result in a loss immunotherapy efficacy are consistent with the
notion that clinical trials using this combined approach should
consider a dose-titration phase. In addition, our multidose
modeling suggested that cyclophosphamide should be administered before each immunotherapy cycle. Most critically, it should
be noted that the treatment effects of the combined regimen are
fairly striking, especially in light of the significant tumor-specific
tolerance we have previously shown in this model.
