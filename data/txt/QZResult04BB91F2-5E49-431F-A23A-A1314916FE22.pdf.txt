ABSTRACT
Telmisartan, a widely used antihypertensive drug, is an angiotensin II type 1
(AT1) receptor blocker (ARB). This drug inhibits cancer cell proliferation, but the
underlying mechanisms in various cancers, including esophageal cancer, remain
unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of telmisartan
on human esophageal cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the
effects of telmisartan on human esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells using the
cell lines OE19, OE33, and SKGT-4. Telmisartan inhibited the proliferation of these
three cell lines via blockade of the G0 to G1 cell cycle transition. This blockade was
accompanied by a strong decrease in cyclin D1, cyclin E, and other cell cycle-related
proteins. Notably, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, a fuel sensor
signaling pathway, was enhanced by telmisartan. Compound C, which inhibits the
two catalytic subunits of AMPK, enhanced the expression of cyclin E, leading to G0/
G1 arrest in human EAC cells. In addition, telmisartan reduced the phosphorylation of
epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) and ERBB2 in vitro. In our in vivo study,
intraperitoneal injection of telmisartan led to a 73.2% reduction in tumor growth in
mice bearing xenografts derived from OE19 cells. Furthermore, miRNA expression
was significantly altered by telmisartan in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, telmisartan
suppressed human EAC cell proliferation and tumor growth by inducing cell cycle
arrest via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.

countries [4]. EAC is among the most lethal cancers, with
only 16% of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis, and
the median survival time is less than 1 year [5].
Telmisartan is an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)
receptor blocker (ARB) that is widely used as an
antihypertensive drug. Several studies have indicated
that angiotensin II promotes cell proliferation during
cancer development, and ARBs suppress this effect by
antagonizing the AT1 receptor [6–8]. ARBs inhibited
the growth of breast [9], endometrial [10], and gastric
cancer cells [11] in several in vitro and in vivo reports.
Furthermore, epidemiological surveys have indicated that

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal carcinoma is the eighth most common
cancer worldwide and the sixth leading cause of cancerrelated deaths [1]. It has one of the worst prognoses of any
cancer, with a 5-year overall survival rate of approximately
15–25%. Diagnosis at advanced (metastatic) stages and
metastasis are associated with poor prognosis [2, 3].
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is less common
than squamous cell carcinoma, but the frequency of
adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, esophageal junction
and gastric cardia has dramatically increased in Western

ARB treatment of hypertensive patients was associated
with lower cancer incidence and mortality rates [12, 13].
Telmisartan is a partial agonist of peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma
(PPAR-γ),
activating the receptor to 25-30% of the maximum level
achieved by the full agonist pioglitazone, a PPAR-γ
ligand [14]. PPAR-γ activation inhibits cell growth in
several cancers [15–18]. Additionally, telmisartan inhibits
the proliferation of various cancer cell types, including
prostate [19], renal [20] and colon [21] cancer cells, by
inducing apoptosis.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular
energy sensor that is present in almost all eukaryotic
cells [22]. It regulates cell growth and proliferation by
modulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling pathway [23, 24]. AMPK is a possible therapeutic
target for cancers with activated Akt signaling because
AMPK inhibits mTOR, which is downstream of Akt [22].
More recently, telmisartan was shown to contribute to the
activation of AMPK in vascular endothelial cells [25, 26].
However, little is known about the antitumor effect of
telmisartan via AMPK/mTOR signaling in cancer cells.
Here, we demonstrate that telmisartan inhibited the
growth of EAC cells by blocking cell cycle progression
at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment
activated the AMPK pathway and suppressed mTOR and
p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) activation.
Thus, this study evaluated the effects of telmisartan
on the growth of EAC cell lines and its mechanism of
action. The miRNAs associated with the antitumor effect
were also examined.

examined cell cycle progression using flow cytometry
analysis. Treatment with 100 μM of telmisartan increased
the population of cells in G1 phase and reduced the
populations of cells in the S and G2/M phases for 24–48 h
after treatment (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 1).
Next, PPAR-γ expression was examined in EAC cell
lines (OE19 and SKGT-4). The PPAR-γ protein level was
significantly up-regulated in OE19 cells compared to that
of SKGT-4 cells (Figure 2B). The effects of telmisartan
on the expressions of various cell cycle-related proteins
in OE19 and SKGT-4 cells were evaluated by western
blotting. Cells were treated with 0 or 100 μM telmisartan
for 24–48 h. The strongest reduction was observed in
cyclin E and cyclin D1, key proteins involved in the
transition from G0 to G1 phase, by telmisartan in a timedependent manner (Figure 2C). In the present study, the
telmisartan-mediated decrease in cyclin D1 and cyclin E
in OE19 cells was only slightly greater than that in SKGT4 cells. However, the PPAR-γ level in OE19 cells was
significantly enhanced compared with that in SKGT-4
cells.
In addition, analysis of other proteins associated
with the G0 to G1 transition indicated that Cdk4, the
catalytic subunit of cyclin D1, was decreased in OE19
cells 24–48 h after the addition of telmisartan (Figure
2C). Cdk2, the catalytic subunit of cyclin E, was also
decreased in SKGT-4 cells 24–48 h after the addition
of telmisartan (Figure 2C). The protein levels of p21Cip1
also increased in response to telmisartan treatment
(Figure 2D). PPAR-γ ligands were previously reported
to inhibit the mRNA expressions of cyclin E and E2F2 in
a colon cancer cell line [16]. However, E2F2 expression
in EAC cells was not detected following treatment with
telmisartan (Figure 2C).
These findings suggest that telmisartan inhibits cell
cycle progression from G0/G1 to S-phase by decreasing
cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels, which results in G1
cell cycle arrest, in a PPAR-γ-independent manner in
EAC cells. We therefore focused on the major pathway
of telmisartan-induced cell cycle arrest in our next
experiments.

RESULTS
Telmisartan inhibits the proliferation and
viability of human EAC cells in vitro
We examined the antitumor effects of telmisartan,
irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan in three EAC cell lines
in vitro. Cells were grown in 10% FBS and treated with 0,
1, 10, or 100 μM of the four ARBs (telmisartan, irbesartan,
losartan, and valsartan) for 48 h.
Telmisartan treatment (100 μM) reduced the
proliferation of three EAC cell lines (OE19, OE33, and
SKGT-4) (Figure 1A). None of the other ARBs (irbesartan,
losartan, valsartan) affected the viability of the EAC cell
lines (Figure 1B–1D). These results demonstrated that
telmisartan strongly inhibits cell proliferation in the three
EAC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.

Telmisartan induces the phosphorylation of
AMPK and regulates cell cycle-related proteins
via the AMPK/mTOR pathway in EAC cells
To evaluate the mechanism of telmisartan-induced
cell cycle arrest, we focused on AMPK/ mTOR signaling.
Telmisartan induced the phosphorylation of AMPKα
at Thr172 in three EAC cell lines, and this activation
lasted for at least 48 h (Figure 3A). The protein levels
of p-mTOR and p-p70S6K decreased in OE19 cells
following telmisartan treatment (Figure 3B). Telmisartan
also increased the phosphorylation of LKB1. However, no
significant changes were observed in CaMKK expression
(Figure 3A).

To determine whether the antiproliferative effect of
telmisartan is mediated by AMPKα/mTOR signaling, we
blocked this pathway using compound C, which targets
the two catalytic units of AMPK. The antiproliferative
effect of telmisartan was attenuated by compound C
compared with that of the control (Figure 3C). More
importantly, telmisartan induced antiproliferative effects
via the AMPKα/mTOR pathway by inhibiting cell cycle
regulatory molecules, especially cyclin E (Figure 3D).
These data indicate that telmisartan regulates cell
cycle-related protein levels by phosphorylation of AMPKα
at Thr172 and induces antiproliferative effects in EAC cells.

an antibody array (Figure 4A), we simultaneously analyzed
the expressions of 46 different activated RTKs in OE19 cells
24 h after telmisartan administration. Telmisartan reduced
the expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor
receptor (p-EGFR) and ERBB2 in vitro (Figure 4B). The
densitometric analyses of p-EGFR and p-ERBB2 showed
decreases of 11.6% and 17.5%, respectively (Figure 4C). In
addition, we evaluated the protein levels of Akt and p-Akt,
which are downstream of EGFR. Telmisartan decreased the
expression of both Akt and p-Akt (Figure 4D).
Furthermore, to determine whether the
antiproliferative effects of telmisartan were mediated via
the Akt pathway, we tested the Akt inhibitor MK-2206
in OE19 cells (Figure 4E). The expressions of cyclin D1
and cyclin E were reduced by telmisartan, and this effect
was slightly attenuated by MK-2206 (Figure 4F). Thus,
telmisartan may partially inhibit cell cycle regulatory
molecules through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to
control cell proliferation in EAC cells.

Telmisartan inhibits the activation of RTKs,
downstream effectors and cell cycle-related
proteins
We used a p-RTK array to identify the key RTKs
associated with the antitumor effects of telmisartan. Using

different from that of the control cells (**, P < 0.01).

body weight during the study. Furthermore, all animals
survived to the end of the experiment.

To determine whether telmisartan could affect tumor
growth in vivo, we subcutaneously injected nude mice with
OE19 cells, followed by i.p. injection of telmisartan. The
telmisartan treatment inhibited tumor growth by 73.2%, as
determined by integrated tumor growth curves (Figure 5A
and 5D), compared with that of the untreated control mice.

Treatment with 100 μM telmisartan for 48 h up-regulated
10 miRNAs and down-regulated 15 miRNAs in OE19
cells (Supplementary Table 1). In the tumor xenograft
model, there were 2 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated
miRNAs in the telmisartan group as determined using the
custom microarray platform (Supplementary Table 2).

conducted using Pearson’s correlation, and the results
indicated that cell lines in vitro and tumor tissues in vivo

treated with telmisartan clustered together and separately
from untreated cell lines and tissues (Supplementary

tumor growth in vivo [9–11]. Recently, a retrospective
study found that treatment with ARBs and angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors is not associated with
survival in esophageal cancer [27]. However, the antitumor
effects of telmisartan in EAC remained unknown. We
demonstrate here for the first time that telmisartan has
antitumor effects in EAC in vitro and in vivo. Telmisartan
induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase by modulating
the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in EAC
cells.
Our flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that
telmisartan significantly induced cell cycle arrest in
EAC cells. These findings were further corroborated by
an analysis of cell cycle-related proteins. A substantial
reduction was observed in the cell cycle regulatory
proteins cyclin E, cyclin D1, and CDKs. Specific cyclin/
Cdk complexes are activated at different times during
cell cycle progression. Complexes of Cdk4 and Cdk6
with cyclin D1 are required for G1 phase progression,
whereas complexes of Cdk2 with cyclin E are required
for the G1-S transition [28]. The expression of various
cell cycle-related molecules has been shown to enhance
esophageal cancer and is related to cancer prognosis [29,
30]. These data indicate that the major cell cycle regulators
(cyclin D1 and cyclin E) may be intracellular targets of
telmisartan in human EAC cell lines. Therefore, inhibition
of these molecules, including cyclin E and cycle D1, may
be a promising strategy for controlling human esophageal
cancer.

Telmisartan has been shown to activate AMPK in
vascular endothelial cells [25, 26] but not in cancerous
cells. Kurokawa et al. reported that telmisartan
independently enhanced the AMPK signaling pathway
[25]. In the present study, telmisartan activated the
AMPK pathway and inhibited p70S6K and mTOR
phosphorylation in EAC cells. In addition, the telmisartanmediated inhibition of cyclin E was attenuated by an
AMPKα inhibitor. These data indicate that telmisartan
induces antiproliferative effects by phosphorylation
of AMPKα at Thr172 in EAC cells, suggesting that the
activation of the AMPKα/mTOR pathway inhibits
cell cycle regulatory molecules. AMPK activation has
recently been shown to inhibit the mTOR pathway and
p70S6K phosphorylation, which are involved in protein
synthesis. The results suggest that this pathway may
regulate cell proliferation in various cancer cells [31–33].
These reports support our finding that AMPKα/mTOR
signaling is a pivotal pathway in the telmisartan-induced
antiproliferative effects.
Activating AMPKα also suppressed cancer cell
proliferation via increased expression of the cell cycle
inhibitor p21 [34, 35]. Additionally, AMPKα has been
linked to two tumor suppressors, LKB1 and CaMKK.
LKB1 is an upstream kinase that phosphorylates
and activates AMPKα in physiological settings [34].
Telmisartan activated LKB1 and AMPKα without
affecting CaMKK and suppressed mTOR activity in EAC
cells. These results indicate that telmisartan reduced the

expression of cell cycle-related proteins and induced cell
cycle arrest via the AMPKα/mTOR pathway in EAC cells
(Figure 6).
Telmisartan is an ARB; thus, AT1R may be involved
in telmisartan-induced cell cycle arrest in EAC. AT1R
induces cell proliferation in multiple cancer cells by
activating various intracellular protein kinase cascades
associated with growth factor stimulation [36]. We found
that telmisartan inhibited EAC cell proliferation, but the
ARBs irbesartan, valsartan, and losartan did not have
antiproliferative effects in the three EAC cell lines. AT1R
was expressed in several EAC cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 5A). Notably, AT1R transactivates EGFR in
several cancers [37], leading to extracellular-regulated
kinase (ERK) activation, phosphorylation of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Among these
pathways, MEK/ERK can regulate cell cycle progression,
apoptosis or differentiation. Therefore, we focused on
MEK/ERK signaling to elucidate the mechanism of
telmisartan-induced cell cycle arrest. The protein levels
of p-p42/44 (Erk1/2) decreased in OE19 cells following

telmisartan treatment, and these effects lasted for at
least 48 h (Supplementary Figure 5B). Furthermore, to
determine the antiproliferative effects of telmisartan
via the MEK/ERK pathway, we tested the ERK1/2
inhibitor SCH772984 in OE19 cells. SCH772984 is a
novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays
characteristics of both type I and II kinase inhibitors
[38]. The expressions of cyclin D1 and cyclin E were
not changed by telmisartan, and this effect was not
attenuated by SCH772984 (Supplementary Figure 5C). In
addition, SCH772984 did not affect telmisartan-induced
down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, even though
the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 were obviously reduced
by telmisartan. Therefore, telmisartan did not induce
cell cycle arrest by decreasing the cell cycle regulatory
molecules through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and
it is independent of the AT1R cascade in EAC cells.
Telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR-γ and
influences the expression of PPAR-γ target genes involved
in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism [14]. Telmisartan
is the strongest PPAR-γ partial agonist among the ARBs
(irbesartan, candesartan, valsartan) [14]. Other PPAR-γ

partial agonists also inhibit cancer cell proliferation by
inducing cell cycle arrest [16–18]. Troglitazone, which is
a strong activator of PPAR-γ, was previously reported to
inhibit the mRNA levels of cyclin E and E2F2 in a colon
cancer cell line [16]. In this study, no significant reduction
in E2F2 was identified following telmisartan treatment,
although telmisartan significantly decreased cyclin E
expression. The antiproliferative effects of PPAR-γ induced
by telmisartan treatment were lower than those induced
by troglitazone treatment because telmisartan is a partial
agonist of PPAR-γ [14, 15]. In addition, the telmisartanmediated decrease in cyclin D1 and cyclin E was similar
in OE19 and SKGT-4 cells despite the large difference in
PPAR-γ expression between these cell lines. Therefore,
these results suggest that PPAR-γ does not play a major role
in the inhibition of EAC cell proliferation and tumor growth
caused by telmisartan-induced cell cycle arrest.
Additionally, we demonstrated that telmisartan
reduces the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERBB2 in
EAC cells using p-RTK arrays. EGFR activation induced
the expression of cyclin D1, a key protein in cell cycle
progression [31]. In this study, telmisartan decreased
the expression level of Akt. mTOR, a major downstream
target of Akt, regulates p70S6K. mTOR and p70S6K are
downstream of PI3K and Akt in pathways regulating G1 cell
cycle progression [39]. We examined the antiproliferative
effects of telmisartan mediated by Akt using MK-2206 in
OE19 cells. The expressions of cyclin D1 and cyclin E were
reduced by telmisartan, and these reductions were slightly
attenuated by MK-2206. A previous study showed that
PPAR-γ partial agonists induce cell cycle arrest by reducing
the levels of p-EGFR, Akt, and p21 in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma [17]. Thus, telmisartan may partially inhibit
cell cycle regulatory proteins via the Akt/mTOR pathway to
control cell proliferation in EAC cells.
Telmisartan has been shown to inhibit cell
proliferation by inducing apoptosis in various cancer cell
lines, including endometrial [10], prostate [19], renal
[20], and colon [21] cancer lines. To determine whether
telmisartan induced apoptosis, we treated EAC cells with
or without 100 μM telmisartan for 24 and 48 h and analyzed
the cells using flow cytometry. Telmisartan did not increase
the proportion of apoptotic cancer cells 48 h after treatment
in OE19, SKGT-4, and OE33 cells (Supplementary Figures
2-3). These results indicate that telmisartan inhibits EAC
cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis.
Telmisartan also markedly suppressed the growth
of subcutaneous EAC tumors in athymic nude mice.
Our in vitro study was conducted using a higher dose
of telmisartan than that used in human treatments (1–10
μM) [14, 40, 41]. However, the use of high doses has
been criticized in similar studies examining other cancer
cell types, such as breast [9], stomach [11], and prostate
cancer cells [19]. Our in vivo study was conducted using a
slightly higher dose of telmisartan than that used in human
administration.

Recently, candesartan, another ARB, was shown
to significantly reduce transforming growth factor β1
(TGF-β1) expression and suppress tumor proliferation
and stromal fibrosis [11]. Candesartan also significantly
inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts and angiogenesis
in mice [11]. Telmisartan reduced VEGF, TIMP-1, and
angiogenin levels in OE19 cells (Supplementary Figure
3). However, fibrotic areas in the implanted tumor derived
from OE19 cells were not decreased by telmisartan in
the xenograft models. This result is anomalous—reduced
expression of TIMP-1 did not affect the activation
of MMPs, which degrade collagen deposition. One
explanation for this result could be the difference between
in vitro and in vivo effects. In an in vivo mouse model,
non-cancerous cells, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells,
and inflammatory cells, that are adjacent to cancer cells
may affect the development of esophageal cancer via cellcell interactions in the solid tumor microenvironment.
MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules,
regulate the development and progression of various
cancers [42]. Several microRNAs were significantly
altered following telmisartan treatment in vitro and
in vivo. Among these microRNAs, miR-200a and
miR-301a were significantly down-regulated in
OE19 cells treated with telmisartan. To clarify the
relationship between p-AMPKα and these miRNAs,
we further assayed the effect of miR-201a-3p and
miR-301a-3p overexpression on the expression and
phosphorylation of AMPKα in OE19 cells treated with
or without telmisartan. miR-200a-3p overexpression
did not attenuate p-AMPKα regardless of telmisartan
treatment (Supplementary Figure 6). However, the
expression of p-AMPKα was induced by telmisartan,
and this effect was slightly attenuated by miR-301a3p (Supplementary Figure 6). Thus, miR-301a-3p
may regulate the phosphorylation of AMPKα through
the AMPKα/mTOR signaling pathway to control cell
proliferation in EAC cells.
Several reports have already shown that i) miR200a directly regulates A2, a receptor for the oncogene
Eph, and decreases cancer cell migration via downstream
activation of AMPKα [43], and ii) miR-301a appears
to directly down-regulate AMPKα1 in osteosarcoma
cells [44]. These findings support our results indicating
that telmisartan inhibited cancer proliferation and tumor
growth via AMPK activation, which was likely enhanced
by the down-regulation of miR-200a and miR-301a. In
addition, there were no matched miRNAs extracted from
cultured cells and implanted tumor tissues in the present
study (Supplementary Figure 4). This also indicates that
cell-cell interactions between tumor cells and stromal cells
may alter the tumor microenvironment.
In conclusion, our results revealed that telmisartan
inhibits human EAC cell proliferation and tumor growth,
inducing cell cycle arrest by regulating cell cycle-related
molecules via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.

HRP-linked anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG
secondary antibodies (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology,
MA, USA) were used.
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with
an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(PerkinElmer Co., Waltham, MA, USA) on X-ray film.

Chemicals
Telmisartan and valsartan were purchased from Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Irbesartan and
losartan were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries
(Osaka, Japan). Telmisartan was prepared as a 10 mM
stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Irbesartan
and valsartan were prepared as 100 mM stock solutions
in DMSO, and losartan was prepared as a 100 mM stock
solution in H2O. The stock solutions were stored at -20°C.
Compound C was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
UK). MK-2206 was purchased from ChemScene Chemicals
(Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). SCH772984 was purchased
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

Cell culture and cell proliferation assay
OE19, OE33, and SKGT-4 human EAC cell
lines were obtained from the European Collection of
Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). All cell lines were
grown in RPMI-1640 (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
penicillin-streptomycin (100 mg/L; Invitrogen) at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Cell proliferation was assayed using the CCK8 cell counting kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were seeded into each
well of a 96-well plate and cultured in 100 μL of RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, ARBs
(telmisartan, irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan at 0, 1, 10,
or 100 μM) or vehicle was added to each well, and cells
were cultured for an additional 48 h. CCK-8 reagent (10
μL) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated
at 37°C for 3 h. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a microplate reader.

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
Cell cycle profiles were analyzed after telmisartan
treatment to assess growth inhibition. OE19, OE33, and
SKGT-4 cells (1.0 × 106 cells in a 100 mm diameter dish)
were treated with or without 100 μM telmisartan for 24–48
h. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by measuring the
amount of propidium iodide (PI)-labeled DNA in ethanolfixed cells. The fixed cells were washed with PBS and
then stored at −20°C for flow cytometry analysis. On the
day of analysis, the cells were washed with cold PBS,
suspended in 100 μL of PBS with 10 μL of RNase A (250
μg/mL) and incubated for 30 min. A 110 μL aliquot of PI
(100 μg/mL) was added to each suspension, and the cells
were incubated at 4°C for at least 30 min prior to analysis.
Apoptotic and necrotic cell death was analyzed by double
staining with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and PI, which
is based on the binding of Annexin V to apoptotic cells
with exposed phosphatidylserine and PI labeling of
late apoptotic/necrotic cells with membrane damage.
Tumor cells were treated for 24 and 48 h. Staining was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Preparation of cell lysates
Cell lysates were prepared as previously described
at 4°C [45]. Protein concentrations were measured using a
dye-binding protein assay based on the Bradford method
[46].

Gel electrophoresis and western blotting
OE19 cells (1.0 × 106/dish) were seeded in 100
mm culture dishes and cultured for 24 h. Then, 100 μM
telmisartan was added, and the cells were further cultured
for 24-48 h. The cells were lysed in a protease inhibitor
cocktail (“complete” protease inhibitor mixture; iNtRON
Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea) on ice for 20 min.
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4°C for 5
min. Supernatants containing the soluble cellular proteins
were collected and stored at −80°C until use. Protein
concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop 2000

Flow cytometry was performed using a Cytomics FC
500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN,
USA). Cell percentages were determined using Kaluza
software (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

The telmisartan group was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected
five times per week with 2 mg/kg telmisartan for four
weeks; the control group was administered 5% DMSO
alone for four weeks. Tumor growth was monitored daily
by the same investigators (S. Fujihara and A. Morishita),
and tumor size was measured weekly. The tumor volume
(mm3) was calculated as the tumor length (mm) × tumor
width (mm)2/2 [49]. All animals were sacrificed on day
22 after treatment, and all animals survived during this
period. Between-group differences in tumor growth were
analyzed by two-way ANOVA.

Antibody arrays of phosphorylated receptor
tyrosine kinases (p-RTKs)
Human p-RTKs were assayed using Human
Phospho-RTK Array Kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, p-RTK array membranes were blocked with 5%
BSA/TBS (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) for 1 h and incubated
with 2 mL of lysate, which was prepared from cell lines
after normalization to ensure equal protein amounts. The
membranes were washed 3 times with TBS plus 0.1%
v/v Tween-20 for 10 min each and 2 times with TBS
alone for 10 min each to remove unbound materials.
Then, the membranes were incubated with an HRPconjugated anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody for 2 h at room
temperature. The unbound HRP-conjugated antibody was
washed away with TBS plus 0.1% Tween-20. Finally,
each array membrane was exposed to X-ray film using
a chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer
Co.). The immunoreactive bands were analyzed by
densitometric scanning (TIc scanner, Shimizu Co., Ltd.,
Kyoto, Japan).

miRNA arrays
Total RNA was extracted from the tumor samples
and cancer cell lines using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA samples typically exhibited A260/280
ratios between 1.9 and 2.1, as determined using an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA).
After RNA measurements were performed with an
RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies), the samples
were labeled using a miRCURYHy3/Hy5 Power Labeling
Kit and were subsequently hybridized to a human
miRNA Oligo chip (v. 21.0; Toray Industries, Tokyo,
Japan). The chips were scanned with a 3D-Gene Scanner
3000 (Toray Industries), and the results were analyzed
using 3D-Gene extraction version 1.2 software (Toray
Industries). Differences in miRNA expression between
the telmisartan-treated and control samples were assessed
using GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent Technologies).
Quantile normalization was performed on the raw data that
were above the background level. Differentially expressed
miRNAs were determined by the Mann-Whitney U
test. The false discovery rate was computed with the
Benjamini-Hochberg method [50] for multiple testing.
Hierarchical clustering was performed using the furthest
neighbor method with the absolute uncentered Pearson’s
correlation coefficient as a metric. A heat map was
produced with the relative expression intensity for each
miRNA, in which the base-2 logarithm of the intensity
was median-centered for each row.

Angiogenic profile analysis using an antibody
array
A Human Angiogenesis Antibody Array (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. This method is a dotbased assay enabling the detection and comparison of 55
angiogenesis-specific cytokines. Each array membrane
was exposed to X-ray film using a chemiluminescence
detection system (PerkinElmer Co.).

Xenograft model analysis
Animal experiments were performed according to
the guidelines of the Committee on Experimental Animals
of Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.
Male athymic mice (BALB/c-nu/nu; 6 weeks
old; 20–25 g) were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc.
and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions
using a laminar airflow rack. The mice had continuous
free access to sterilized (γ-irradiated) food (CL-2; CLEA
Japan, Inc.) and autoclaved water. Each mouse was
subcutaneously inoculated with OE19 cells (5 × 106 cells
per animal) in the flank. One week later, the xenografts
were identifiable as masses with a maximal diameter >
4 mm. The animals were randomly assigned to treatment
with telmisartan (50 μg per day) or diluent only (control).

Gene transfection
miR-200a-3p mimics, miR-301a-3p mimics, and
negative control miRNA were obtained from Thermo
Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). OE19 cells were seeded
in 6-well plates. After 24 h, OE19 cells were transfected
with miR-200a-3p mimic, miR-301a-30 mimic, or
negative control miRNA at a final concentration of 10
nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA). After a 24 h incubation, the cells were
harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS for subsequent
analysis.
