Abstract
Lack of target specificity by existing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors has hindered antimetastatic
cancer drug discovery. Inhibitors that bind to noncatalytic sites of MMPs and disrupt protease signaling function
have the potential to be more specific and selective. In this work, compounds that target the hemopexin (PEX)
domain of MMP-9 were identified using an in silico docking approach and evaluated using biochemical and
biological approaches. Two of the selected compounds interfere with MMP-9–mediated cancer cell migration
and proliferation in cells expressing exogenous or endogenous MMP-9. Furthermore, these inhibitors do not
modulate MMP-9 catalytic activity. The lead compound, N-[4-(difluoromethoxy)phenyl]-2-[(4-oxo-6-propyl-1Hpyrimidin-2-yl)sulfanyl]-acetamide, specifically binds to the PEX domain of MMP-9, but not other MMPs. This
interaction between the compound and the PEX domain results in the abrogation of MMP-9 homodimerization
and leads to blockage of a downstream signaling pathway required for MMP-9–mediated cell migration. In a
tumor xenograft model, this pyrimidinone retarded MDA-MB-435 tumor growth and inhibited lung metastasis.
Thus, we have shown for the first time that a novel small-molecule interacts specifically with the PEX domain of
MMP-9 and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by reducing cell migration and proliferation. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Mortality in cancer is primarily because of failure to prevent
metastasis. Much attention has been focused on targeting
tumor growth; drug discovery targeting metastasis has lagged
far behind. Thus, there is a pressing need for novel treatment
strategies to prevent metastasis. Emerging evidence has
emphasized the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in
early aspects of cancer dissemination (1–3). The demonstration that several MMPs display protumor, as well as antitumor
effects (4), highlights that more specific inhibitory drugs are
required for clinical development.
MMPs have also been implicated in other disease entities,
leading to the development of numerous drugs, which inter-

fere with MMP enzymatic activity (5). Several classes of
compounds, including peptidomimetics, tetracyclines, and
bisphosphonates, have been designed to bind and inhibit
the catalytic activity of MMPs (6, 7). However, the catalytic
domains of all MMPs share a highly conserved binding site
and lack of specificity of these MMP inhibitors (MMPI) has
hindered their development as drugs. After the failure of
broad-spectrum MMPIs in the treatment of cancer in phase
III clinical trials, a reevaluation of the biological roles of the
MMPs has been undertaken (8).
A major conceptual advance in the development of novel
MMPIs is to target less conserved, noncatalytic domains of
the proteases to increase target specificity and selectivity.
Exosites are crucial for the catalytic functions of most
MMPs; enzyme lacking their hemopexin (PEX) domain or
the addition of an exogenous PEX domain greatly inhibits
the proteolytic efficiency of the enzyme (9–11). Because the
PEX domains of MMPs are not as highly conserved as the
catalytic sites (Supplemental Table S1), the PEX domain is
an alternative site that can inhibit the biological roles of
MMPs with greater selectivity (12, 13). Novel therapeutics
targeting MMP exosites are currently being evaluated with a
focus to develop drugs with fewer side effects than previously developed broad-spectrum catalytic-site inhibitors
(8, 14).
MMP-9 is linked to many pathological processes including
cancer invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, as well as
cardiovascular, neurologic and inflammatory diseases (2, 3,
15). Elevated levels of MMP-9 in tissue and blood are observed

in these conditions. Active MMP-9 is an attractive target for
cancer therapy development (16). The ability of MMP-9 to
degrade collagen and laminin correlates with its ability to
regulate cell migration, increase angiogenesis and affect
tumor growth (15, 17). In addition to the effects of activated
MMP-9 in degrading substrates and cleaving biologically
relevant proteins, proMMP-9 induces cell migration independent of any proteolytic activity (12, 13, 17). Enhanced
epithelial cell migration is linked to the formation of homodimers through the MMP-9 PEX domain, as well as heterodimers with other cell surface molecules (12, 13).
In the present study, we utilized an in silico docking
approach to screen for novel compounds that bind to the
MMP-9 PEX domain. Experimental assay of the best-fitting
compounds identified a small molecule with micromolar
affinity for MMP-9. This small molecule selectively inhibits
cell migration, proliferation, invasion, tumor growth, and
metastasis induced by MMP-9.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagents, and transfection
COS-1 monkey epithelial, human HT-1080, and MDAMB-435 cancer cell lines, and murine macrophage-like
RAW246.7 cell line were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen)
containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of plasmid
DNA (human) into cells was achieved using polyethylenimine (Polysciences) and the transfected cells were
incubated for 48 hours at 37 C followed by assay.
MMP-9 and MMP-9/MMP-2PEX (13) proteins were purified
from transfected cell–conditioned media by GelatinSepharose chromatography. Compounds 1–5 (Supplementary Table S2) were purchased from Enamine Ltd. and
their purity was verified by LC/MS to be greater than 98%.
Anti-tubulin, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-pERK1/2 antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mac-PL-G-L-Dpa-A-R-NH2 fluorogenic peptide was obtained
from R&D Systems.
Fluorogenic assay of enzyme activity
Fluorogenic peptide substrate (50 mmol/L; ref. 18) was
incubated with the compounds either in the presence or
absence of latent MMP-9 and p-aminophenylmercuric acetate
(APMA)-activated MMP-9 for 30 minutes at 25 C before
detection. Fluorescence emission at 393 nm with excitation
at 328 nm was measured in a fluorescent plate reader (Gemini
EM; Molecular Devices).
Fluorescence spectroscopy
Binding of compound 2 to MMP-9 was assayed by observing
the change of tryptophan emission upon binding. Purified
recombinant MMP-9 (50 nmol/L) or MMP-9/MMP-2PEX (50
nmol/L) was diluted in buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 60 mmol/
L KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence
of compound 2. As a control for protein stability and loss, an
analogous buffer solution was added to the protein. The

protein sample was excited at 280 nm and emission scans
were collected from 290 to 400 nm, using slit widths of 0.3 nm
on a QM-4/200SE spectrofluorimeter with double excitation
and emission monochromators. Three emission scans were
collected and averaged at each concentration. The Kd was
determined using the Prism software package (GraphPad V5)
to fit the data to Equation (A).

in which lmax is the wavelength at which maximal fluorescence of the protein was observed.
Cell viability
Compound cytotoxicity was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega Corporation). COS-1 cells (2.5  104) were plated to a 96-well
plate and incubated for 18 hours with compounds 1–5.
Luminescence was recorded using a SpectraMax Microplate
Reader (Molecular Devices). Lethal doses (LD50) of the
compounds were measured over a 100 pmol/L to 10
mmol/L concentration range. The LD50 was determined
using the Prism software package (GraphPad V5) and fitting
to Equation (B).

Cell proliferation
Cell proliferation was determined using the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Assay. Cells (5  103) were added to a 96-well
plate in the presence or absence of the compounds and
monitored for 9 days by luminescence assay.
In vivo study
Human MDA-MB-435 cancer cells (2  106) expressing
green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA were inoculated subcutaneously into 4- to 5-week-old female NCR-Nu mice with 5
mice per group (Taconic). Once palpable, tumors were measured twice/week and volume was calculated using the following formula: length  width  height  0.5236. Mice were
treated with a vehicle control (DMSO/PBS), compound 2, or 4
(20 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal and intratumoral injection
alternately (6 days/week). At 14 weeks, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors and lungs were dissected. Fresh lung
sections were cut (3 mm thick) and examined for the
presence of GFP-expressing tumor foci. The area of metastatic
foci per field of examination was quantified from 10 random
sites of 3 different slides for each mouse using NIH ImageJ
software.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  SE of triplicates. Each
experiment was repeated as least 3 times. Student's t test and
analysis of variants (ANOVA) were used to assess differences
with *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; and ***, P < 0.001.

Novel Synthetic Inhibitors Targeting the PEX Domain of MMP-9

Identification of small molecules targeting the PEX
domain of MMP-9 using DOCK
We utilized DOCK 6.0 (23) to map potential ligand binding
sites in the PEX domain of human MMP-9, which contains the
dimerization interface. Homodimerization is observed under
X-ray crystallographic conditions (PDB: 1ITV; ref. 24) and in
cell culture (12). The structures of the 2 subunits are similar,
but not perfectly symmetric, therefore we used subunit A in its
entirety for docking. A large cavity in the center of the top face
of the barrel (24) formed by the innermost strands of all 4
blades and the loops which connect them to the second
b-strand of each blade was identified (Fig. 2A and B).
As proof-of-principle that docking to the PEX domain was
feasible, 100 commercially available compounds were selected
from the ZINC 2007 database (25) and docked. Docked
molecules were ranked on basis of their cluster size, grid
score (energies), van der Waals energies, and electrostatic
energies. The top 5 hits docked to the cavity (Fig. 2A and B)
and are shown in Figure 2D and in Supplementary Table S2.
Four of the 5 hits contain a 4-pyrimidone core with variable

Probability of survival

MMP-9 expression correlates with the survival
probability of patients
MMP-9 is one of the Rosetta 70 genes, serving as a poor
prognosis signature for patients with breast cancer (20). To
gain insight into the clinical significance of MMP-9 in patients
with breast cancer, we analyzed 2 additional publicly available
DNA microarray datasets, which contain a large number of
breast cancer patient samples, to establish a correlation
between MMP-9 expression and the probability of diseasefree survival.
Patient samples were grouped on the basis of MMP-9 RNA
expression dichotomized at the mean value in the Van de
Vijver cohort, which contains 295 breast cancer patients (21).
High expression of MMP-9 was found to be significantly
associated with shortened overall survival rate by Kaplan–
Meier analysis (P ¼ 0.0143; Fig. 1A). In lymph node negative
group patient samples (120 cases) in the same cohort, high
expression of MMP-9 correlated with lower patient survival
probability (P ¼ 0.0203, data not shown). In analysis of the
Stockholm cohort (GSE 1456; ref. 22), similar survival probability results were obtained when MMP-9 RNA expression
was dichotomized at the mean from 159 breast cancer patient
samples (P ¼ 0.0126; Fig. 1B). In addition, patients in the high
MMP-9 expression group had a higher cumulative incidence of
relapse (P ¼ 0.0059; Fig. 1C). Hence, elevated expression levels
of MMP-9 in breast cancer correlate with a poor prognosis and
suppressing MMP-9 may improve patient outcome.

minutes, and examined by a Transwell chamber migration
assay. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 5 inhibited the migration of
MMP-9–expressing COS-1 cells, whereas compound 4 showed
no activity (Fig. 3A–E). Compounds 3 and 5, but not 1 and 2,
inhibited the migration of control cells (GFP-transfected) as
well as MMP-9–transfected cells (Fig. 3C and E).
To rule out the possibility that the reduction of cell migration by these compounds was because of cytotoxicity, a cell
viability assay was conducted. COS-1 cells were treated with
the compounds for 24 hours followed by a cytotoxicity assay.
Thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer that inhibits intracellular
Ca2þ-ATPases (26), was used as a positive control to trigger
cell death. Treatment with compounds 1, 2, and 4 did not
cause notable cytotoxicity at the maximum concentration

used, whereas treatment with compounds 3 and 5 induced
cell death (Fig. 3F). Compounds 3 and 5 were therefore
excluded from further evaluation.
The LD50 of compounds 1 and 2 was determined in COS-1
cells. The cells were treated with increasing doses of the
compounds for 24 hours followed by cell viability assay
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The LD50 of compounds 1 and 2
were 360  2 mmol/L and 3.5  0.3 mmol/L, respectively,
suggesting that their inhibition of MMP-9–induced cell migration was not because of cytotoxicity.
To further determine the specificity and selectivity of
compounds 1 and 2 for MMP-9–induced cell migration,
we examined the effect of compounds 1 and 2 on cell
migration induced by other MMPs in which the PEX domain

has been reported to play a critical role in enhanced cell
migration (27), for example, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP (MMP14). In contrast to MMP-9–expressing cells, neither compound inhibited the migration of MMP-2 or MT1-MMP
ectopically expressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition,
compound 2 did not interfere with MT1-MMP–mediated
cancer cell invasion examined by a 3 dimensional (3D)
invasion assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, small-synthetic compounds that potentially bind to the PEX domain
of MMP-9, inhibit MMP-9–induced cell migration with
enhanced specificity and selectivity.

endogenous MMP-9. Two human invasive cancer cell lines,
HT-1080 and MDA-MB-435, expressing high endogenous
levels of MMP-9 were employed. Treatment of the cells with
compounds 1 and 2 significantly reduced cell migratory
abilities. Furthermore, both compounds inhibited the migration of HT-1080 and MDA-MB-435 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 4B and C).
Cell migration is a critical determinant of cancer cell
invasiveness. Therefore, HT-1080 cells were assessed in the
3D type I collagen invasion assay (19). As anticipated, the cell
invasive ability of HT-1080 cells was significantly inhibited in
cells treated with compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 4D and E).
Inhibition of MDA-MB-435 cell invasion was also observed
(data not shown). These data suggest that inhibition of MMP9–mediated cell migration by the compounds results in suppressed cancer cell invasion.

Novel Synthetic Inhibitors Targeting the PEX Domain of MMP-9

Compounds 1 and 2 do not affect MMP-9 expression or
proteolytic activity
Cell lysates from HT-1080 cells treated with and without
compounds 1 and 2 were examined for MMP-9 expression
levels by Western blot using an anti-MMP-9 antibody. Western
blotting using an antibody to tubulin was employed as a
control. No effect on MMP-9 expression by the compounds
was observed (Fig. 5A).
Activated MMP-9 was obtained by incubating purified
proMMP-9 with APMA (12). Addition of compounds 1 and
2 to APMA-activated MMP-9 did not inhibit the catalytic
activity of MMP-9 as measured by cleavage of the fluorescent
Mca-P-L-G-L-Dpa-A-R-NH2 peptide (18; Fig. 5B). These data
suggest that inhibition of MMP-9–induced cell migration by
compounds 1 and 2 is not because of inhibition of MMP-9
expression or proteolytic activity.
Binding of compound 2 to the MMP-9 PEX domain
We titrated the binding of compound 2 to MMP-9 by
monitoring MMP-9 tryptophan fluorescence. Saturation of
purified proMMP-9 with compound 2 resulted in a 7 nm blue
shift in the lmax of MMP-9 emission (Fig. 5C). No effect on
the protein fluorescence occurred in the buffer only
control. The Kd for MMP-9 binding to compound 2 is
2.1  0.2 mmol/L.
To further characterize the binding between compound 2
and MMP-9, we employed a previously generated chimera of
MMP-9 in which the PEX domain of MMP-9 was replaced with
that of MMP-2 (MMP-9/MMP-2PEX; ref. 13). Upon addition of
compound 2 to MMP-9/MMP-2PEX, no shift in fluorescence
was detected (Fig. 5D). Likewise, compound 2 did not bind to
purified recombinant soluble MT1-MMP (28; data not shown).
These data confirmed that compound 2 binds specifically to
the PEX domain of MMP-9. The absorption of compound 1 at
280 nm precluded evaluation of its binding properties.
To test whether compound 2 interferes with proMMP-9
homodimerization, coimmunoprecipitation of COS-1 cells
transfected with both proMMP-9/Myc and proMMP-9/HA
cDNAs in the presence or absence of compounds 2 and 4
was utilized (13). Treatment of the transfected cells with
compound 2, but not inactive compound 4, resulted in
blocked MMP-9 homodimer formation (Fig. 5E). This defect
was not because of inhibition of expression of MMP-9 by
compound 2 as evidenced by Western blotting of the cell
lysate from HT-1080 cells (Fig. 5A). Similar results were
obtained in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays
(Fig. 5E). This experiment confirms that compound 2 specifically inhibits MMP-9 homodimerization.
Homodimerized MMP-9 interacts with cell surface adhesion molecule, CD44, which leads to activation of EGFR and
downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MAPK–ERK1/2) pathway
(12, 13). To explore this network, the activity status of downstream effector ERK1/2 was examined. COS-1 cells ectopically
expressing MMP-9 cDNA were serum starved in the presence
or absence of compounds for 18 hours followed by Western
blotting using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 antibodies. As depicted in Figure 5F, decreased activation of

www.aacrjournals.org

ERK1/2 was observed in compound 2–treated cells. Taken
together, these data suggest that abrogation of MMP-9–
mediated cell migration by compound 2 is because of
disruption of MMP-9 homodimerization, which results in
failure to cross-talk with CD44 and the EGFR–MAPK signaling
pathway.
Effect on MMP-9–mediated cell proliferation by
compound 2
COS-1 cells transfected with MMP-9 or GFP cDNA (control) were monitored for cell proliferation in the absence or
presence of compound 2 or 4 with a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent assay. In agreement with previous observations (29), the
rate of cell proliferation increased significantly (P < 0.05) in
COS-1 cells expressing MMP-9 as compared with GFP
expressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 6A). MMP-9–induced cell proliferation was not affected by compound 4, consistent with
its lack of effect on MMP-9–induced cell migration. In
contrast, compound 2 significantly decreased MMP-9–
induced cell proliferation (Fig. 6A), but did not affect the
proliferation of COS-1 cells transfected with GFP cDNA
(Fig. 6B). To determine if compound 2 also affects the
proliferation of cancer cells producing endogenous MMP9, HT-1080, and MDA-MB-435 cancer cells were treated with
10 mmol/L compound 2. Significant inhibition of cell proliferation was observed for HT-1080 and MDA-MB-435 cells
treated with compound 2, but not with compound 4 or with
DMSO controls (Fig. 6C and D).
Decreased tumor growth and lung metastases in
compound 2–treated mice
MDA-MB-435 cells are highly metastatic in nude mice (30,
31) and produce high levels of MMP-9, thus serving as an
appropriate experimental model to explore the in vivo inhibitory activity of compounds exhibiting anti-MMP-9 activity.
To facilitate in vivo analysis of tissues and visualization of the
lung metastases, MDA-MB-435 cells were stably transfected
with GFP cDNA and implanted subcutaneously within the
mammary fat pad of female immunodeficient mice. Treatment of mice with compound 2 resulted in a profound delay in
tumor growth, whereas treatment with the inactive control
compound 4 or the vehicle alone failed to inhibit tumor
growth (Fig. 7A and B). Tumor incidence was unaffected by
compound 2.
The lungs of tumor-bearing mice were removed and slices
of the lungs (3 mm thickness) were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 7C). In the vehicle control and compound 4–treated groups, multiple large nodules were evident
in MDA-MB-435/GFP tumor–bearing mice, whereas the
extent of lung metastasis was dramatically reduced in mice
treated with compound 2 (Fig. 7D). Also, dimensions of tumor
foci area in the lung and the percent of mice displaying lung
metastases were significantly decreased in these mice (Fig. 7D
and E). Thus, treatment with compound 2 impaired the in vivo
effect of MMP-9 on both primary tumor growth and metastasis. Neither significant change in body weight nor other signs
of toxicity during the 14-week-period were observed in compound 2–treated mice.

Figure 5. Interaction of compound 2 with the PEX domain of MMP-9. A, no effect of the compounds on MMP-9 expression: cell lysate of compound-treated
HT1080 cells was examined by Western blotting (WB) using antibodies against MMP-9 and a/b tubulin, respectively. B, no inhibition of proteolytic
activity of MMP-9 by the compounds: Latent and APMA-activated MMP-9 were incubated with DMSO control or the selected compounds 1 and 2 (100 mmol/L)
for 3 hours at 37 C followed by a fluorogenic substrate assay. C and D, compound 2 binds selectively to the PEX domain of MMP-9: The lmax of tryptophan
fluorescence emission was monitored upon titration with compound 2 or buffer only as a control with (C) purified recombinant MMP-9 (50 nmol/L) and
(D) MMP-9/MMP-2PEX chimera 9 (50 nmol/L). E, compound 2 interferes with MMP-9 homodimerization. COS-1 cells transfected with MMP-9-Myc and
MMP-9-HA in the presence or absence of compounds 2 and 4 (100 mmol/L) were pulled down with anti-HA antibody followed by WB with anti-Myc antibody.
The aliquots of total cell lysates serving as input were examined by WB using anti-Myc antibodies. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation was also carried out.
F, compound 2 decreased MMP-9–mediated ERK1/2 activation: COS-1 cells transiently transfected with vector control and MMP-9 cDNAs were
serum-starved for 18 hours in the presence or absence of compounds 2 and 4 (100 mmol/L) followed by WB using anti-pERK1/2 and total ERK1/2
antibodies.

Discussion
In this study, we show the identification and characterization of synthetic compounds that specifically interfere with
MMP-9–mediated cell migration. This inhibitory effect works

through the abrogation of MMP-9 dimerization via the PEX
domain, and subsequent blockage of the CD44–EGFR–MAPK
signaling pathway (13).
The role of the PEX domain of MMP-9 in cancer cell
migration has gained considerable attention (32–34). Lengyel

and colleagues (35) showed that high expression of proMMP-9
in ovarian cancer patients correlated with poor survival, activated MMP-9 was not implicated or detected, thus suggesting a
critical role of the noncatalytic domains of MMP-9 in cancer
progression. We showed that latent MMP-9 was able to initiate
cell migration through a proMMP-9–CD44–EGFR–MAPK
pathway independent of its catalytic activity (12, 13). We
further identified that the PEX domain plays a critical role
in proMMP-9–mediated cell migration, in agreement with
previous reports (32–34). The validation of the MMP-9 PEX
domain as a drug target has recently been explored through
different experimental approaches: (i) anti-PEX antibodies
block Schwann cell migration (33); (ii) exogenous recombinant
PEX domain inhibits the migration of endothelial cells (antiangiogenic effect), as well as intracranial glioblastoma growth
(32); (iii) noncatalytic-domain inhibitors of MMP-9 selected
from a phage display peptide library interfere with cell migration and tumor formation (34); and (iv) peptides mimicking
motifs of the outermost strands of the first and fourth blades of
the PEX domains of MMP-9 abrogate MMP-9–mediated cell

migration (13). These results prompted us to hypothesize that
low molecular weight compounds interacting with the PEX
domain of MMPs may interfere with its function.
The PEX domain of MMP-9 shares low amino acid identity
(25% to 33%) with secreted MMP-1, -2, -8, -9, -10, and -28, as
well as membrane anchored MT1-MMP, in contrast to the
high conservation in their catalytic domains (43%–65%; Supplementary Table S1). The differences between the PEX
domains of MMP-9 and other MMPs determine their distinct
biological roles in cell function.
The MMP-9 PEX domain is a barrel-shaped structure
composed mostly of hydrophobic surfaces making this
domain difficult to target with drugs (5, 24). Our results
indicate that the surface cavity within the loops of the MMP9 PEX domain is targetable by small compounds. Compounds 1 and 2, identified through docking, specifically
and selectively inhibit cell migration induced either by
ectopically expressed MMP-9 or by endogenous MMP-9 as
well as cancer cell invasion in a 3D type I collagen invasion
assay (Fig. 4D). The latter is believed to be due to the

Novel Synthetic Inhibitors Targeting the PEX Domain of MMP-9

or MT1-MMP (Fig. 5C and D). MMP-9 homodimerizes
through interactions in the fourth blade of its PEX domain
(24). Furthermore, formation of the homodimer is required
for cell migration, an important component of metastasis.
Blade III is flexible because of the presence of Gly615 and its
flexibility may contribute to stabilization of the monomeric
versus the dimeric form of the PEX domain (24). The
structural components of the best 3 compounds each contain
a 6-membered heterocycle which docks within the identified
site in the PEX domain. The flat rings preferentially dock
within the cavity of the MMP-9 PEX domain blades, whereas
the more flexible side chains (i.e., arylamide group of
compound 2) likely bind on the surface proximal to the cavity
(Fig. 2B). Therefore, the proposed binding orientation in the
PEX domain is consistent with allosteric disruption of the
dimer interface and consequently migration.
MMP-9 has been implicated in primary tumor growth and
metastasis of various cancers (2). Silencing MMP-9 in cancer
cells was reported to reduce tumor growth, angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis (36). However, there are inconsistencies in the literature regarding whether or not MMP-9
enhances tumor growth in in vivo cancer models (1, 37, 38).
Importantly, compound 2 inhibited cancer cell metastasis in
vivo (Fig. 7), presumably because of reduction in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and migration. Compound 2 inhibits
tumor growth without affecting tumorigenicity. Moreover,
compound 2 inhibits tumor metastasis of MDA-MB-435/
GFP cells in vivo, presumably by interfering with PEX interaction(s) with downstream pathway(s) required for cell migration and invasion. In agreement with previous studies (32, 34),
our results suggest that the PEX domain of MMP-9 is involved
in both cell proliferation and migration both of which contribute to increased tumor growth and metastasis. The main
source of MMP-9 in some murine tumor models is from
tumor-associated stromal and inflammatory cells (1, 29, 37,
39), leading to the possibility that an antitumor effect of an
MMP-9 inhibitor in vivo could be due to an effect on host cells.
Human MMP-9 and murine MMP-9 proteins share 72% amino
acid identity. To distinguish whether the antitumor activity of
compound 2 in vivo is because of an effect on mouse stromal/
inflammatory cells or on human tumor cells, we examined the
effect of this compound on mouse RAW264.7 macrophage-like
cells expressing endogenous MMP-9. Compound 2 has no
notable effect on the migration of mouse macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S3), leading us to conclude that the inhibitory
effect of compound 2 is directed at human tumor MMP-9.
We previously showed that CD44 is a key molecule
involved in proMMP-9–enhanced cell migration through
an EGFR–CD44 signaling pathway along with other downstream effectors including phosphorylated FAK, AKT, and
ERK (13). Because compound 2 inhibits MMP-9 dimerization and ERK1/2 activation, we propose that the mechanism

of inhibition by compound 2 of MMP-9–mediated cell
migration is via disruption of MMP-9 dimer formation,
and hence, blockage of the downstream MMP-9–CD44–
EGFR–MAPK signaling pathway. In accordance with our
data, Peng and colleagues (40) showed that an increase in
MMP-9, after colocalization with CD44 on the cell surface of
MDA-MB-435 cells, stimulated the tumor cell invasion and
metastasis. In another study, Yu and Stamenkovic (41)
showed a cascade involving a MMP-9/CD44/TGF-b pathway
that promotes the metastatic potential of selected tumor
types; interference with the MMP-9/CD44 complex induced
apoptosis.
In conclusion, we selected MMP-9 as a suitable target for
drug discovery because of its high expression in human
cancer tissues, tight correlation with the probability of
patient survival and numerous in vitro and in vivo studies
implicating MMP-9 in tumor progression (5, 8, 15). We
identified small molecules that specifically interfere with
MMP-9–mediated cell migration. Our data show that compound 2 specifically binds to the PEX domain of MMP-9 and
abrogates MMP-9 homodimerization which blocks the
CD44–EGFR–MAKP signaling pathway (13) and interferes
with MMP-9–mediated cancer cell proliferation, migration,
and invasion to reduce tumor metastasis. To our knowledge,
this is the first example of a low molecular weight compound
that targets the noncatalytic PEX domain of an MMP. Our
proof-of-principle study should have a positive impact on
future drug discovery in which the PEX domain exosite of
other MMPs can be targeted.
