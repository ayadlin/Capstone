BACKGROUND. Response rates in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are now
reported based on the cumulative incidence of a single-time best response. The
study aim was to examine the significance of different response criteria for CML
on imatinib therapy.

METHODS. In all, 276 patients with chronic phase CML on imatinib therapy were
analyzed. Cytogenetic and molecular responses were coded as to single best
response and response at specific intervals of treatment.

RESULTS. The cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response (CGCR)
with imatinib was 91%; however, the incidence of CGCR at 48 months into therapy was only 78%. Similarly, the incidence of major molecular responses (best
cumulative vs landmark at 48 months) were 74% versus 62%, and of undetectable
BCR-ABL transcripts 38% versus 24%. There was a strong association between
achievement of major cytogenetic response (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positivity 35%) at 6 months to 12 months and survival as well as progression-free
survival (PFS). Achievement of major molecular response (vs lesser molecular
response) in patients in complete cytogenetic response was not associated with
significant differences in survival, but showed some association with PFS. Durable CGCR and major molecular responses (documented continuously for 12
months) were associated with longer PFS duration but not with survival duration
differences. Of interest, major molecular responses documented at least twice
were noted in 71% of patients on imatinib therapy; undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts documented at least twice were noted in 34%.

CONCLUSIONS. Achievement and durability of CGCR and of major and complete
molecular responses at landmark times predict outcome in CML, and may help in
comparing the efficacy of different treatments. Cancer 2008;112:837–45.  2007

he definitions of partial and complete cytogenetic responses
were proposed during the era of interferon-a,1 a treatment
which produced complete cytogenetic responses in 10% to 25% of
patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).2–4 A complete cytogenetic response was
defined as disappearance of Ph-positive cells (0% Ph-positive) studied by routine cytogenetic analysis on at least 20 metaphases. The
overall incidence of complete cytogenetic response was based on
the cumulative incidence of this response, observed as a single first
event at any time during the course of therapy. Achieving a complete cytogenetic response correlated with survival.2–4

CML indicates chronic myeloid leukemia.

Using this definition, most patients receiving
imatinib therapy (over 85%) achieve a complete cytogenetic response. Many (40%–70%) also achieve a
major molecular response (3 log reduction of BCRABL:BCR transcripts; reduction of BCR-ABL:ABL ratio
to 0.1% or less), and some (10%–40%) have undetectable levels of BCR-ABL.5–9
The problem with the current definitions of
complete cytogenetic response, and of major and
complete molecular response, is that over a long
course of therapy (eg, 5 years) with multiple evaluations (eg, average 2–4 per year), patients have to
demonstrate such a response only once (in 10 to 15
measurements) to be entered into the overall best
response rate, even if they later lose such a response.
This form of reporting may provide a better than realistic assessment of treatment efficacy. An alternative approach to reporting these responses is at
particular landmark times. These have proven valua-

molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL:ABL levels <0.1%), and undetectable

ble in predicting outcome. For example, any cytogenetic response at 6 months, a major (less than 35%
Ph-positive) cytogenetic response at 12 months, and
a complete cytogenetic response at 18 months have
been associated with better progression-free survival
(PFS) rates and overall survival in the International
Randomized Trial of Interferon-a versus STI571
(IRIS)6,7 and in other studies.8,9 Reporting such
response rates may not account for the total denominator at the start of study because of early failures,
lack of follow-up, or missed evaluations at the particular time.
Reporting durable responses, which can be
defined as responses lasting continuously for at least
3 months (documented twice), 6 months (documented 3 times), or 12 months (documented 3–4
times), may provide a more realistic assessment of
high-quality responses. These may be associated
more convincingly with long-term treatment benefit.
They may also allow for better comparative evaluations of the benefit of various treatments, eg, standarddose versus high-dose imatinib versus new tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. This is the subject of the current
analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adults with a diagnosis of Ph-positive CML in early
chronic phase (diagnosis of CML for less than 12
months) referred to our institution since 1998 and
treated on imatinib regimens were reviewed. Patients
received imatinib on institution-approved protocols.
Informed consents were obtained according to institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Dec-

laration of Helsinki. Eligibility criteria, treatment
plans, treatment evaluations, and response criteria
were previously detailed.8,9 Evaluation of molecular
response was previously published.8–10 Briefly, a
complete cytogenetic response referred to disappearance of Ph-positive cells (0% Ph-positive) by routine
cytogenetic analysis. A partial cytogenetic response
referred to reduction of Ph-positive cells to 1%–35%.
A major cytogenetic response referred to reduction of
Ph-positive cells to 35% or less. A major molecular
response was defined as BCR-ABL/ABL transcript
levels <0.1% by real-time Taq human-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on peripheral blood or marrow samples. This represents a
3-log reduction from the average baseline for
untreated patients in our laboratory. A complete mo-

lecular response was defined as undetectable BCRABL transcripts (level of detection of at least 4.5
logs). Response status was evaluated every 3 months
in the first year and every 6 months in the subsequent 4 years. This evaluation was uniform across all
studies. For the purpose of this study we entered the
cytogenetic and molecular results at each timepoint
evaluated. The denominator excluded only patients
who had not reached that follow-up landmark timepoint or who did not have the test for practical reasons (eg, missed appointment, noncompliance). All
others (including failures or death before the evaluation landmark) were included. We also coded into
the database the durability of a response. This was
measured from the date of the first response (event)
until the date of loss of that particular response.

Survival was analyzed from start of therapy and,
when specified, from the particular landmark time.
PFS was defined as being on therapy without any of
the following: loss of a cytogenetic response (Phpositivity increase by at least 30% or to above 65%),
loss of hematologic response, progression to accelerated or blastic phase, or death from any cause during
therapy.8,11 Loss of major molecular response in a
patient who is still in at least a major cytogenetic
response is not considered to define progression.

RESULTS
A total of 276 patients in early chronic phase CML
on imatinib therapy were analyzed. Their characteristics are shown in Table 1. Additional chromosomal
abnormalities (cytogenetic clonal evolution in the
9 patients listed in Table 1) included: 2 patients with

double Ph; 1 patient with double Ph, trisomy 8, and
other translocations; 1 patient with double Ph and
other changes; 1 patient with 1Y; 4 patients with
translocations or other cytogenetic abnormalities.
The incidence of complete cytogenetic response
at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 months, at last follow-up,
and overall are shown in Figure 1. Of the 276
patients, 269 had more than 1 molecular analysis.
The incidences of major (QPCR 0.1% or less) molecular and complete molecular responses at the same
timepoints and overall are shown in Figure 1. As discussed earlier, in these analyses patients who had
progressed or lost the response before the time evaluations were included. The only patients excluded
from a particular timepoint analysis were patients
responding and on therapy but who missed the evaluation time (eg, accidentally or for socioeconomic
reasons), or whose follow-up time was still shorter

than the evaluation timepoint, or who were off therapy because of toxicity or reasons other than resistance. The overall response column refers to the best
response (as reported in previous studies).
Survival from 6, 12, 18, and 24 months by cytogenetic response at these timepoints is shown in Figure 2A–D. These data confirm the strong associations
between achieving a major cytogenetic response at 6
or 12 months and survival. PFS for the same timepoints is shown in Figure 3A–D, confirming the association of cytogenetic response with PFS. Complete
cytogenetic response at 18 to 24 months was also
associated with subsequent PFS.
Survival from 6, 12, 18, and 24 months by molecular response in all patients is shown in Figure 4A–D.
PFS is shown in Figure 5A–D.
Survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months by molecular
response only in patients who were in complete

cytogenetic response are shown in Figure 6A–D. PFS
is shown in Figure 7A–D. These results suggest that,
whereas the degree of molecular response predicts
from survival, it is not independent so far from the
degree of cytogenetic response. The degree of molecular response (major, less than major, undetectable
levels) is not associated with differences in survival
outcome in patients in complete cytogenetic response. PFS showed a trend for its association with
the degree of molecular response within complete
cytogenetic responses (Fig. 7A,C), but such differences may not be clinically relevant. This is in line
with previous findings,9 including the IRIS data.11
The incidence of durable complete cytogenetic
responses, lasting for at least 6 to 24 months, and of
durable major and complete molecular responses
lasting for at least 6 to 24 months are shown in Table 2.

cytogenetic response (for at least 12 months), or
major (for at least 12 months) and complete molecular response (for at least 6 months), are shown in
Figure 8A–C. The median time to first complete cytogenetic response was 3.2 months for patients with
durable complete cytogenetic response 12 months
versus 3.1 months for patients with less durable
complete cytogenetic response. The median time to
first major molecular response was 7.4 months for
patients with durable major molecular response 12
months versus 11.7 months for patients with less
durable major molecular response. Durable complete
cytogenetic responses and durable major molecular
responses for at least 12 months predicted better PFS
rates. Overall survival was not different at this time
of follow-up by whether patients had achieved these
durable responses or not (data not shown).
The incidences of durable complete cytogenetic
response and of durable molecular response are
summarized in Table 2. The rates of complete cyto-

genetic responses durable for 12 months or more
were 76% with high-dose imatinib versus 59% with
standard dose imatinib. The rates of major molecular
responses durable for 12 months or more were 45%
versus 39%, despite the shorter median follow-up
time with high-dose imatinib (median follow-up
time 43 vs 67 months).

DISCUSSION
The long-term follow-up of imatinib studies is now
showing an incidence of complete cytogenetic
response, defined as achieving this response at least
once, of 85% to 90%. Reporting the incidences of best
cytogenetic or molecular response achieved at least
once in the course of therapy of an individual patient
is a measure of the efficacy of imatinib in reducing
CML burden to a minimal disease state. Also, reporting
the association of a response at a landmark point (eg,
6, 12, or 18 months) with PFS is an important prognos-

tic and decision-making tool for these patients. These
response endpoints are reasonable early surrogate
endpoints for survival and PFS benefits.
In our study we have confirmed the significance
of achieving a major cytogenetic response at 6 or 12
months for survival benefit. Within the limitation of
this study (heterogeneous group and imatinib doses;
methodology of molecular studies) we could not confirm an added benefit of achieving a major molecular
response in patients in complete cytogenetic
response for survival. There were some trends of
associations for PFS (though clinically not relevant).
This is similar to the IRIS trial findings in which
achieving a major molecular response (3 log reduction of molecular disease) at 12 months in patients in
complete cytogenetic response was associated with
statistically significant, but clinically not relevant,
better PFS rates (estimated 5-year PFS rates 100% vs
95%; P 5 .01).7 This observation may have important
practical consequences. Recent trends in CML have

emphasized the importance of close monitoring of
minimal molecular residual disease, advocating molecular studies every 3 months.5 Our analysis suggests
that in a patient in stable durable complete cytogenetic response, the degree of molecular response
(major molecular response vs less than major) may
not be a significant prognostic factor for survival or
even PFS. Thus, in a patient in complete cytogenetic
response, molecular studies may not need to be performed more frequently than every 6 months.
Durability of complete cytogenetic response and
of major and complete molecular responses (eg, for
at least 6 to 12 months) may now become more important for the analysis of comparative efficacies of
new treatments or investigations. In this study the
incidence of durable complete cytogenetic response
for at least 12 and 24 months were 71% and 54%,
respectively. The incidences of durable major molecular responses from at least 12 and 24 months were
43% and 33%, respectively, and of durable undetect-

able BCR-ABL levels 10% and 6%, respectively. These
are important observations regarding the durability
of complete cytogenetic responses as well as the durability of major and complete molecular responses,
which have not been reported in previous studies.
They also show that such responses, if durable for 12
months or more, have been associated with significantly better PFS rates (Fig. 8). Of note, the incidence
of major molecular response as an event documented at least twice was 71%, and of complete molecular response as an event documented at least twice
34%. The latter event used to be reported as infrequent, less than 5%, but has been reported to be
higher in several studies.9,10,12 Reporting the rates of
these durable responses in future updates of imatinib
studies, and with the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
may allow a better assessment of the comparative
efficacies of these approaches in CML. We propose,
for consistency of analysis and comparisons in future
trials, to report 1) the cumulative incidence of best
complete cytogenetic response (as before); 2) the
incidence of major and complete cytogenetic

response at the landmark times of 6, 12, and 18–24

3) the incidences of durable complete cytogenetic
and major/complete molecular responses (documented to last for 6 to 12 months or more).
