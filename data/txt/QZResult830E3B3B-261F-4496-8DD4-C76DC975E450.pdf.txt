Abstract
Locoregional and distant recurrence remains common and
usually fatal for patients with advanced head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). One promising molecular
target in HNSCC is the Src family kinases (SFK). SFKs can
affect cellular proliferation and survival by activating the
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family
of transcription factors, especially STAT3. Surprisingly, sustained SFK inhibition resulted in only transient inhibition
of STAT3. We investigated the mechanism underlying STAT3
activation and its biological importance. Specific c-Src
knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in
STAT3 activation showing specificity, which was inhibited by
Janus-activated kinase (JAK; TYK2 and JAK2) depletion with
siRNA. Sustained SFK inhibition also resulted in recovered
JAK-STAT3 binding and JAK kinase activity after an initial
reduction, although JAK phosphorylation paradoxically decreased. To determine the biological significance of STAT3
activation, we combined specific STAT3 depletion with a
pharmacologic SFK inhibitor and observed increased cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. Likewise, the addition of STAT3- or
JAK-specific siRNA to c-Src–depleted cells enhanced cytotoxicity relative to cells incubated with c-Src siRNA alone. These
results show that reactivation of STAT3 after sustained,
specific c-Src inhibition is mediated through altered JAKSTAT3 binding and JAK kinase activity and that this
compensatory pathway allows for cancer cell survival and
proliferation despite durable c-Src inhibition. To our knowledge, this novel feedback pathway has never been described
previously. Given that pharmacologic SFK inhibitors are
currently being evaluated in clinical trials, these results have
potential clinical implications for cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The estimated annual worldwide incidence of head and neck
cancer is 500,000 (1). Head and neck cancers are particularly
difficult to treat because both the tumor and the treatment can
impair essential functions, such as speech and swallowing, and can
also severely alter facial appearance, leading to social isolation.
Although novel approaches have improved locoregional control in
patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

(HNSCC), recurrence remains common and almost always fatal.
There is a great need to improve systemic therapy for HNSCC.
One promising set of molecular targets for which new agents have
been developed is the Src family kinases (SFK; ref. 2). SFKs are
nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulate multiple signaling
cascades. Aberrant activation of c-Src occurs in many solid tumors
and contributes to properties of progression and metastasis (3, 4).
c-Src is expressed in areas of hyperproliferation in HNSCC and in
dysplastic epithelium (5). Several SFKs are expressed and activated
by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, transforming growth factor-a, in HNSCC cell lines (6). Expression of
activated c-Src is higher in HNSCC tumor tissue than in normal
mucosa, and it correlates with an invasive, poorly differentiated
phenotype and advanced nodal stage (7). Interest in SFKs as targets
for cancer therapy has increased recently because of the
development and low toxicity of pharmacologic SFK inhibitors.
c-Src can affect cellular proliferation and survival by activating
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; ref. 8).
The STAT family of transcription factors, especially STAT3,
regulates oncogenic signaling in many tumor types (9). Activation
of STAT3 is required for viral Src-mediated transformation (10).
STAT3 activation leads to the increased expression of downstream
target genes (e.g., BcL-XL, cyclin D1, and survivin) and to increased
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth in vivo (11).
Inhibition of STAT3 in HNSCC leads to increased apoptosis,
decreased proliferation, and decreased tumor size (12, 13). We
found that SFK inhibition using pharmacologic inhibitors led to an
initial and expected inhibition of STAT3, but surprisingly, this was
followed by STAT3 reactivation despite durable SFK inhibition (14).
No defined pathway explains this reactivation of STAT3 in the face
of sustained SFK inhibition.
STAT3 can be activated by growth factor and cytokine receptors
via nonreceptor tyrosine kinases [SFKs or Janus-activated kinases
(JAK); ref. 9], although growth factor receptors can activate STAT3
independent of JAK (15). We previously evaluated the effects of
dasatinib, an SFK/Abl inhibitor currently in clinical trial, on several
pathways known to lead to STAT activation in HNSCC and other
epithelial tumors. EGFR, mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK;
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2], cyclooxygenase 2,
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-Met were not mediators
of dasatinib-induced STAT3 reactivation. None of the 25 cytokines
or growth factors that we measured were up-regulated by
dasatinib. The addition of pharmacologic JAK inhibitors (16)
during dasatinib incubation resulted in the sustained inhibition of
STAT3. However, JAK activation by dasatinib (as measured by
phosphorylation) was not demonstrated (14).
In this study, we investigated both the mechanism underlying
the activation of STAT3 that occurs after sustained SFK inhibition

Src Inhibition Activates STAT3 via JAK

and its biological consequences. We determined that STAT3
reactivation occurs after specific c-Src depletion and is JAK
dependent. Our data show that STAT3 reactivation is mediated
through JAK kinase activity and JAK-STAT3 binding but is
independent of JAK phosphorylation. Inhibition of STAT3 reactivation via specific knockdown of JAK or STAT3 enhanced the
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest caused by c-Src depletion. Because
STAT3 reactivation occurs in multiple cancer cell types (14, 17), our
findings have implications for a broad range of tumors for which
SFK inhibitors are currently in clinical trial.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Dasatinib was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb and prepared
as a 10 mmol/L stock solution in DMSO. Dasatinib for animal studies was
purchased from M. D. Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy. Antibodies used
included c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); pY419-c-Src, pY705-STAT3, pAkt
(S473), total AKT, pERK1/2, total ERK, BcL-XL, survivin, cleaved poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), cyclin E, pRb (S780), p27, p21, JAK2, and TYK2
(Cell Signaling Technology); phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology); and
h-actin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Pyridone 6 was purchased from Calbiochem.
Cell culture. Human HNSCC cell lines used in this study were obtained
from Drs. Jeffrey Myers and Gary Clayman (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX) and maintained as previously described (3).
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Western blot
analysis was performed as previously described (14). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% glycerol, 20 Ag/mL
leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride

(PMSF), and 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate]. Equal amounts of protein cell
lysates (800 Ag) were precleared with protein A G-Sepharose beads (Sigma
Chemical) for 1 h. The precleared lysate was incubated with 5 Ag of the
indicated antibody for 2 h. Agarose beads (30 AL) were added and incubated
for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with immunocomplex buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% glycerol, 20 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate] and resolved by
SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblots
were probed with primary antibody and detected with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay was used to assess cytotoxicity as previously described (14).
Eight wells were treated for each experimental condition.
Cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Cell cycle analysis was performed as
previously described (18). Briefly, fixed cells were stained with propidium
iodide and DNA content was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis (Becton Dickinson) using ModFit software (Verity Software
House).
For the apoptosis analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using
the manufacturer’s protocol (APO-BRDU kit, Phoenix Flow Systems). Briefly,
fixed cells were washed and then incubated with DNA labeling solution that
contained terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and bromodeoxyuridine
triphosphate (Br-dUTP) for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with a
fluorescein-labeled anti-Br-dUTP antibody and then analyzed by FACS.
Measurement of STAT3 DNA binding. Cells were incubated with
100 nmol/L dasatinib or vehicle (DMSO). Nuclear proteins were extracted

using the manufacturer’s protocol (Nuclear Extraction kit, Chemicon
International). Cells were harvested using trypsin, washed with PBS, lysed,
and disrupted with a small-gauge needle. Disrupted cells were spun in a
centrifuge at 8,000  g for 20 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in
nuclear extraction buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
The nuclear suspension was then spun in a centrifuge at 16,000  g for
5 min. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was incubated with a biotinylated,
double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus STAT3 binding
site. STAT3/oligonucleotide complexes were captured by an immobilized
STAT3 antibody and detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(R&D Systems). Absorbance was read and wavelength correction was
performed by subtracting the A 570 from the A 450. Controls included a
sample with no cell lysate, one with an unlabeled oligonucleotide, and
interleukin-6 (IL-6)–stimulated cells.
Transfection with small interfering RNA. Cells were harvested,
washed, and suspended (106/100 AL) in Nucleofector V solution (Amaxa).
Small interfering RNA (siRNA; 200 pmol/100 AL) was added and electroporated using the U-31 Nucleofector program (Amaxa). Immediately after
electroporation, 500 AL of prewarmed RPMI 1640 were added, and the cells
were transferred to six-well plates. The medium was changed after 16 h. All
siRNAs were predesigned (siGENOME SMARTpool, Dharmacon). Controls
included cells that were mock transfected (i.e., no siRNA) and those
transfected with a nontargeting (scrambled) siRNA.
STAT3 transcriptional assay. The acute-phase response element
(APRE)-luciferase reporter gene construct, which has four copies of APREs
in front of the minimal JunB promoter-luciferase gene, was provided by
Dr. Shuo Dong (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; ref. 19). Tu167
cells were transfected with 500 ng of APRE-luciferase reporter gene.
Transfected cells were incubated with dasatinib, vehicle control, IL-6
(positive control), or pyridone 6 (negative control). Cell lysates were
analyzed for luciferase activity.

Orthotopic nude mouse models. All animal procedures were done in
accordance with the policies of M. D. Anderson’s Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Tu167 cells were injected submucosally into the
tongues of athymic nude mice as described elsewhere (20). When visible
tumor developed, dasatinib was administered by oral gavage at a dosage of
20 mg/kg/d. Mice were euthanized, tumors were dissected, and mice were
examined for regional and distant metastases. The tongue tumors were
homogenized and subjected to Western blotting.
In vitro kinase assay. Tu167 cells were incubated with 100 nmol/L
dasatinib, vehicle control, or 10 Amol/L pyridone 6. Cells were then lysed
and immunoprecipitated with the JAK2 antibody as described above. The
immunocomplexes were washed thrice with wash buffer (20 mmol/L TrisCl, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100,
2.5% glycerol) and resuspended in kinase assay reaction buffer {20 mmol/L
HEPES/100 Amol/L sodium orthovanadate (pH 7.4), 3 mmol/L MgCl2,
3 mmol/L MnCl2, 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq)}.
During the kinase assay, 100 nmol/L dasatinib or 10 Amol/L pyridone 6 was
added in their respective samples. Acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase
(10 Ag; Sigma Chemical) was added as an exogenous substrate and
incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was terminated
with sample buffer [2% SDS, 5% h-mercaptoethanol, 0.125 mol/L Tris (pH
6.8), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue]. Immunocomplexes were boiled for 5 min and separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel
was fixed and boiled with 1 mol/L KOH for 20 min. Radiolabeled proteins
were detected by autoradiography.

Src Inhibition Activates STAT3 via JAK

STAT3 activation, we examined the effect of the SFK inhibitor
dasatinib at early time points in a panel of HNSCC cells using
Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Because confluence can affect
STAT3 activation, vehicle controls were included at 0 and 7 hours.
In all cell lines, c-Src phosphorylation was rapidly and durably
inhibited at a site associated with its activation (pSrc, Y419 in
human c-Src). STAT3 activation was transiently inhibited at
30 minutes to 0.4 F 0.3 times the control levels, but levels of
phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3; Y705) began to recover by 2 hours (1.1 F
0.5 times control) and returned to baseline levels or above by 4 and
7 hours (1.5 F 0.8 and 2.6 F 1.5 times control, respectively; Fig. 1B).
Because phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 can also influence
STAT3 transcriptional activity, we examined the effect of SFK
inhibition on this site (Fig. 1C ). In contrast to tyrosine
phosphorylation, dasatinib did not affect STAT3 serine phosphorylation at early time points; however, serine phosphorylation
increased at 7 hours (2.3 F 0.9 times the control level), consistent
with STAT3 reactivation.
To determine whether STAT3 reactivation occurred in vivo, we
injected Tu167 cells into the tongues of nude mice. Once tumors
formed, dasatinib (20 mg/kg/d) was administered, and the mice

were euthanized at 1, 5, and 7 hours and at 14 days (Fig. 1D). On
immunohistochemical staining, the grossly dissected tumors were
primarily HNSCC (>80%) and no nodal or distant metastases were
discovered (data not shown). Dasatinib treatment resulted in
durable Src and focal adhesion kinase inhibition at all time points.
Consistent with our in vitro data, STAT3 activation (Y705) was
inhibited at the early time points but its activity recovered after
chronic exposure to dasatinib. Although the pattern was identical
between the in vivo and in vitro models, STAT3 reactivation
occurred later in the in vivo model, likely the result of differences
in drug exposure.
To show that the phosphorylation of STAT3 actually reflected
increased STAT3 activity, we also measured STAT3 DNA binding in
cellular nuclear extracts (Fig. 2A) and observed a similar pattern of
early STAT3 inhibition (30 minutes, 0.5 F 0.1 times the control
level), but STAT3 activity began to recover by 4 hours (0.8 F 0.2
times control) and returned to baseline levels or above by 7 hours
(1.3 F 0.2 times control). To measure STAT3 transcriptional
activity, cells were transfected with the APRE-luciferase reporter
gene and incubated with dasatinib, vehicle control, IL-6 (positive
control), or pyridone 6 (JAK inhibitor, negative control). Again, we

observed a similar pattern of decreased STAT3 activity at early time
points with reactivation by 4 to 7 hours (Fig. 2B).
STAT3 reactivation is c-Src specific. To determine whether
STAT3 reactivation is downstream of c-Src and is not caused by an
off-target effect of dasatinib, we transfected HNSCC cells with
siRNA specific to c-Src and examined the effect on STAT3
activation (Fig. 2C). When c-Src was depleted, the levels of pSrc
decreased, but pSTAT3 increased by 2.1 F 0.3 times the control
levels (Fig. 2D).
STAT3 reactivation depends on JAK2 and TYK2. We
hypothesized that JAK mediates STAT3 reactivation during
sustained SFK inhibition, so we examined the effect of JAK
depletion on STAT3 activation. Tu167 cells express two of the four
known JAK family members: TYK2 and JAK2 (14). Incubation of
Tu167 cells with TYK2-specific siRNA led to decreased STAT3
activation; TYK2 depletion also decreased STAT3 reactivation after
dasatinib exposure. JAK2 depletion alone did not affect STAT3
activation, but it did decrease STAT3 activation after SFK
inhibition. The combination of TYK2 and JAK2 depletion
completely abrogated the reactivation of STAT3 after dasatinib
exposure (Fig. 3A). To show specificity, we combined c-Src–specific
siRNA with TYK2/JAK2 siRNA. c-Src depletion led to STAT3
activation, which was inhibited by specific knockdown of JAK2 and
TYK2 (Fig. 3B and C).
Sustained c-Src inhibition results in recovery of JAK activity
and JAK-STAT3 binding despite decreased JAK phosphorylation. Given that our results show that the reactivation of STAT3
is mediated by JAK2 and TYK2, we hypothesized that SFK

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

inhibition leads to JAK2 and TYK2 activation; we next examined
phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 after SFK inhibition at sites
shown to be important for kinase activity in other systems.
Incubation with dasatinib resulted in prompt and sustained
decreases in both JAK2 and TYK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) that
corresponded with the time course during which we observed
both STAT3 inhibition and reactivation (Fig. 1). In other words,
there was no correlation between the effects of dasatinib on
STAT3 activation and its effects on the phosphorylation of JAK
(JAK2 or TYK2). Dasatinib has no direct effects on JAK proteins.4
Likewise, specific c-Src knockdown using siRNA resulted in
decreased JAK2 and TYK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B).
To investigate this, we performed an in vitro kinase assay in
which HNSCC cells were incubated with vehicle, dasatinib, or
pyridone 6 followed by immunoprecipitation with the JAK2
antibody. A kinase assay was then performed on the immunoprecipitated JAK2 (Fig. 4C); drug exposure was maintained in the
immunoprecipitate. In cells incubated with pyridone 6 for 7 hours
or with dasatinib for 15 minutes, JAK2 activity was profoundly
inhibited. However, incubation with dasatinib for 7 hours resulted
in the recovery of JAK activity; this correlated with the reactivation
of STAT3 observed in these cells after sustained SFK exposure
(Figs. 1A and 2A and B).

Src Inhibition Activates STAT3 via JAK

We next examined the effect of c-Src inhibition on interactions
between JAK and STAT3. Cells were treated with dasatinib or
pyridone 6, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with JAK2 or TYK2
antibodies to identify JAK-binding proteins that were affected by
c-Src or JAK inhibition. When blotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine

after transfection with STAT3 siRNA or controls. For the cell cycle analysis (B),
cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by FACS; the proportion

antibody, only two phosphoproteins were observed, of approximately 80 and 135 kDa (data not shown), which were subsequently
shown to be STAT3 and JAK2/TYK2 (Fig. 4D). At the 1-hour time
point, dasatinib incubation resulted in decreased JAK-STAT3
binding. Conversely, at the 7-hour time point, JAK-STAT3 binding
recovered to baseline levels. The JAK inhibitor did not affect JAK
phosphorylation but did inhibit JAK-STAT3 binding. In contrast to
the effects on phosphorylated JAK, the effects of dasatinib and
pyridone 6 on JAK-STAT3 binding corresponded to their effects on
STAT3 activation.
Specific depletion of STAT3 enhances cytotoxicity, cell cycle
arrest, and apoptosis induced by SFK inhibition. STAT3
mediates survival and proliferation in HNSCC (12), and its
activation likely opposes the antitumor effects of SFK inhibition.
We next examined the biological effects of STAT3 reactivation on
HNSCC cells. To specifically knock down STAT3, we transfected
HNSCC cell lines with STAT3 siRNA. Tu167 and Tu686 cell lines
were chosen because of their distinct baseline sensitivities to
dasatinib. We observed that STAT3 protein levels decreased by 45%
at 24 hours, by >80% at 48 hours, and by >95% at 72 to 120 hours
(Fig. 5A; data not shown). Dasatinib or vehicle was added 48 hours
after transfection, and an MTT assay was used to estimate the
number of living cells remaining 72 hours later. HNSCC cells with
depleted STAT3 were significantly more sensitive to dasatinib than
control cells. IC50 values for Tu167 were 23, 19, and 4 nmol/L in
mock-transfected, scrambled siRNA–transfected, and STAT3
siRNA–transfected cells, respectively; IC50 values for Tu686 were
616, 558, and 205 nmol/L in the same respective transfections.
To determine the effects of combined STAT3 and SFK inhibition
on cell cycle and apoptosis, HNSCC cells were transfected with
STAT3 siRNA and incubated with dasatinib. In Tu167 cells, STAT3
depletion alone had no effect on the cell cycle but enhanced the
degree of arrest induced by dasatinib (Fig. 5B). The percentage of
Tu167 cells in G1 at 48 hours was approximately equal in all
samples treated with vehicle control (f40%), approximately equal
in cells treated with 40 nmol/L dasatinib alone (f66%), and
markedly increased in cells treated with STAT3 siRNA and
dasatinib together (89%). Tu686 cells were treated with higher
concentrations of dasatinib (200 nmol/L) because of their
decreased sensitivity to the drug. As it did in Tu167 cells, dasatinib
resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cells in the
S phase, although this was only minimally enhanced by the
knockdown of STAT3 (Fig. 5B). Dasatinib alone resulted in
apoptosis in both cell lines that was enhanced by the depletion
of STAT3 siRNA (Fig. 5C). These data show that SFKs and STAT3
cooperate to maintain cell survival and proliferation.
Depletion of STAT3 enhances cytotoxicity of specific c-Src
depletion. To determine whether STAT3 knockdown enhances the
cytotoxicity of c-Src depletion, we transfected HNSCC cells with
scrambled siRNA, STAT3 siRNA, c-Src siRNA, or both c-Src and
STAT3 siRNA and subsequently measured cytotoxicity using the
MTT assay (Fig. 6A). Unlike dasatinib, c-Src siRNA inhibits only one
SFK family member, although HNSCC cell lines express seven SFKs
(data not shown); c-Src siRNA is also a less potent c-Src inhibitor
than dasatinib (Fig. 1A versus Fig. 2C). Despite these limitations,
c-Src depletion still resulted in cytotoxicity that was enhanced by
the addition of STAT3 siRNA. Likewise, the addition of TYK2 and
JAK2 depletion to c-Src depletion resulted in increased cytotoxicity
(Fig. 6B). These data are consistent with the results for STAT3
siRNA combined with dasatinib, but they showed that this effect is
specific to c-Src.

Figure 6. Depletion of STAT3 enhances
cytotoxicity and the downstream signaling
effects of c-Src depletion. A, Tu167 cells
were transfected with STAT3-specific
siRNA, c-Src–specific siRNA, both, or
controls. The number of viable cells was
estimated 96 h after transfection with an
MTT assay and expressed as the amount
of change from control levels (vehicle
alone). B, Tu167 cells were transfected
with TYK2- and JAK2-specific siRNA,
c-Src–specific siRNA, all three, or controls.

Bars, SD. Tu167 (C ) or Tu686 (D ) cells
that were transfected with STAT3 siRNA or
controls were incubated with 40 nmol/L

24 h and then lysed and analyzed by
Western blotting.

STAT3 depletion enhances the proapoptotic and antiproliferative cell signaling pathways downstream of SFK inhibition.
We examined the pathways known to be downstream of STAT3 and
SFKs in HNSCC cells incubated with dasatinib and transfected with
STAT3 siRNA (Fig. 6C and D). Consistent with the biological effects
of combined STAT/SFK inhibition, we observed increased expression of proapoptotic markers (cleaved PARP) and decreased
expression of antiapoptotic molecules (BcL-XL and survivin) in
cells with combined SFK inhibition and STAT3 knockdown. The
decreased expression of cyclin E and pRb and increased expression
of p27 and p21 are consistent with the observed cell cycle arrest in
G1. As previously shown, use of dasatinib alone led to inhibition of
AKT and MAPK in the sensitive cell line (Tu167; Fig. 6C) but not in
the resistant cell line (Tu686; Fig. 6D; ref. 3).

Discussion
In this study, we found that during sustained c-Src inhibition,
STAT3 is activated, as shown by increased levels of STAT3
phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. The
recovery of STAT3 phosphorylation was reproduced in all six
HNSCC cell lines. We showed that this pathway is c-Src specific and
JAK dependent. However, JAK phosphorylation after c-Src or JAK
inhibition did not correlate with effects on STAT3 activation. In

contrast, both acute c-Src inhibition and pyridone 6 led to
decreased JAK-STAT3 binding and JAK kinase activity; sustained
c-Src inhibition resulted in the restoration of both JAK-STAT
binding and JAK activity. Inhibition of this compensatory pathway
with either STAT3 or JAK2/TYK2 siRNA enhanced the cytotoxic,
antiproliferative, and proapoptotic effects of c-Src inhibition.
The means by which sustained c-Src inhibition affects JAKSTAT3 interaction and JAK kinase activity remains undefined. In
epithelial tumors, STAT3 activation is mediated by EGFR,
erythropoietin receptor, IL-6 receptor, PDGFR, c-Met, and IGF-IR
(6, 15, 21–25). We previously showed that inhibition of these
receptors does not inhibit STAT3 reactivation after incubation with
dasatinib (14).4 Three negative feedback loops regulate JAK/STAT
function after cytokine signaling: SH-2–containing phosphatases
(SHP), which inactivate JAK; protein inhibitors of activated STAT
(PIAS), which are negative regulators of STAT3-mediated transcription; and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). SOCS
proteins regulate JAK-STAT signaling by inhibiting JAK kinase
activity, facilitating proteosomal degradation, and competing with
STATs for binding to cytokine receptors (26). No known positive
feedback loops lead to STAT3 activation after its inhibition (27).
Given that there was no change in the protein levels of JAK or
STAT3, JAK phosphorylation decreased, and STAT3 phosphorylation and transcription recovered, it is unlikely that proteosomal

Src Inhibition Activates STAT3 via JAK

degradation, SHPs, or PIAS mediate STAT3 reactivation. However,
reactivation of STAT3 after its initial inhibition does suggest a
feedback loop, possibly via the loss of a negative regulator that is
transcribed by the basally activated STAT3. The most likely
regulators are SOCS proteins that can compete for STAT binding
and inhibit JAK kinase activity.
We showed recovery of JAK-STAT3 binding and JAK kinase
activity despite decreased JAK phosphorylation. JAK is activated
after ligand binding leads to cytokine receptor dimerization and
JAK transphosphorylation. JAKs contain two conserved phosphorylation sites adjacent to the activation site (Y1007/1008 in JAK2 and
Y1054/1055 in TYK2) that regulate kinase activity. The activated
JAK molecules then phosphorylate multiple sites on the cytokine
receptor that allow for STAT binding and phosphorylation by JAK
(9). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to JAK activation
are not fully understood, and this model may be an oversimplification. For example, activation of JAK2 can occur in the absence
of Y1007/1008 phosphorylation, which theoretically obviates the
need for JAK activation by an upstream kinase (28). Our data
clearly reinforce the finding that JAK2 kinase can be activated in
the absence of Y1007/1008 phosphorylation. Several other JAK
phosphorylation sites exist; for example, Y221 (JAK2) and Y570
(JAK2) have been reported to increase and decrease kinase activity,
respectively.
Although both HNSCC cell lines we tested showed increased
cytotoxicity with the combination of dasatinib and STAT3 siRNA,
the intrinsically resistant line (Tu686) still had IC50 values for
dasatinib that are above the concentrations needed to inhibit c-Src
and that are barely achievable in humans. This is consistent with

additional resistance mechanisms existing in Tu686 cells that are
not affected by STAT3 knockdown. We previously showed that
these additional mechanisms result in the persistent activation of
AKT and MAPK in resistant cells after SFK inhibition (14).
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that JAK-STAT3
binding and JAK kinase activity are initially inhibited and then
recover, leading to STAT3 reactivation after sustained, specific
c-Src inhibition. We have observed STAT3 reactivation in multiple
tumor types (14, 17), showing that this pathway is not restricted to
HNSCC. STAT3 reactivation diminishes the antitumor effects of
SFK inhibition by affecting cancer cell survival and proliferation.
Given that STAT3 activation can also increase angiogenesis (29)
and that SFK inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical
trials, defining the role of this compensatory pathway in patients
treated with SFK inhibitors is essential and planned for the future.
Studies that combine SFK and JAK inhibitors in vivo are also
planned.
