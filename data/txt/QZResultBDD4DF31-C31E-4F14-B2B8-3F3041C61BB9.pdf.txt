ABSTRACT
The human kinome is gaining importance through its promising cancer therapeutic
targets, yet no general model to address the kinase inhibitor resistance has emerged.
Here, we constructed a systems biology-based framework to catalogue the human
kinome, including 538 kinase genes, in the broader context of the human interactome.
Specifically, we constructed three networks: a kinase-substrate interaction network
containing 7,346 pairs connecting 379 kinases to 36,576 phosphorylation sites in 1,961
substrates, a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) containing 92,699 pairs,
and an atomic resolution PPIN containing 4,278 pairs. We identified the conserved
regulatory phosphorylation motifs (e.g., Ser/Thr-Pro) using a sequence logo analysis.
We found the typical anticancer target selection strategy that uses network hubs as
drug targets, might lead to a high adverse drug reaction risk. Furthermore, we found
the distinct network centrality of kinases creates a high anticancer drug resistance
risk by feedback or crosstalk mechanisms within cellular networks. This notion is
supported by the systematic network and pathway analyses that anticancer drug
resistance genes are significantly enriched as hubs and heavily participate in multiple
signaling pathways. Collectively, this comprehensive human kinome interactome map
sheds light on anticancer drug resistance mechanisms and provides an innovative
resource for rational kinase inhibitor design.

INTRODUCTION

for resistance is that kinases are extensively involved
in complex biological mechanisms through adaptive
crosstalk or feedback within cellular networks.
Most kinases are proteins, while others are lipids or
small molecules. There are more than 600 putative kinase
genes that account for ~3% of human protein-coding genes
[13]. The kinases catalyze the reversible phosphorylation
of ~500,000 phosphorylation sites in ~20,000-22,000
human proteins, playing critical roles in human cells as
well as other eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, kinases are
involved in various key cellular signaling pathways,
including transcription, cancer cell metabolism, cell cycle
progression, apoptosis, and differentiation [2,4,13]. It has
been estimated that more than 400 human diseases are

The human kinome has become one of the most
important classes of drug targets in the pharmaceutical
industry [1-3]. So far, more than 20 drugs targeting one
or more kinases have been approved for clinical use in
a variety of cancers, including lung, breast, melanoma,
colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers [1,4,5].
Moreover, as of 2012, more than 500 kinase inhibitors
have been used as therapeutic drugs, approximately
a third of which are undergoing clinical trials [4,6].
However, patients treated with those kinase inhibitors
eventually develop resistance, and their prolong survivals
are typically only a few months [5,7-12]. One reason

caused by kinase signaling pathway defects (http://www.
kinasenet.ca/). So far, more than 80% of kinases have been
investigated as drug targets for therapeutic development.
However, a quantitative network measurement of
functional relationships among drugs, kinases, and
the human protein interactome at the kinome level
remains largely unknown. Constructing a global human
kinase phosphorylation network and the human kinome
interactome resource is therefore essential to further
explore the relationship among drug responses, network
properties, and cellular functions, thereby accelerating
rational kinase inhibitor design for cancer therapy.
In this study, we developed a systems biologybased framework to construct a global human kinome
interactome map by integrating the kinase-substrate
interaction network (KSIN), kinase-drug interaction
network (KDIN), physical protein-protein interaction
network (PPIN), and atomic resolution three-dimensional
structural PPIN (3DPPIN). We systematically examined
and compared the network topological and functional
properties of several important gene or protein sets in this
global human kinome interactome. These sets include
kinase genes, Mendelian disease genes (MDGs), orphan
disease-causing mutant genes (ODMGs), Cancer Gene
Census (CGC) genes, essential genes, anticancer drug
sensitivity genes, drug target proteins, and adverse drug

reaction-associated proteins (ADRPs). We identified the
conserved regulatory phosphorylation motifs (e.g., Ser/
Thr-Pro) using a sequence logo analysis, which provides
the evidence that the proline direction of kinases is a
crucial mechanism in the conserved phosphorylation
signaling pathways. We found that the distinct network
centrality (e.g., hubs) of kinases creates a high risk
for the evasion of single kinase target inhibition by
feedback or crosstalk mechanisms. This notion is further
supported by the systematic network and pathway
analyses that anticancer drug resistance genes are
significantly enriched as hubs and heavily participate
in multiple cancer signaling pathways. Furthermore,
we provided the statistical evidence that the typical
anticancer target selection strategy, which uses network
hubs as drug targets, might lead to a high risk for adverse
drug reactions. Collectively, this study sheds light on
kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms and provides an
innovative systems biology resource for rational kinase
inhibitor design in individualized cancer therapy.

kinome interactome map. The current version of the
human kinome [13] includes 637 genes categorized into
10 groups: tyrosine kinases (TK), tyrosine kinase-like

kinases (TKL), casein kinases (CK1), PKA/PKG/PKCfamily kinases (AGC), calcium/calmodulin-dependent
kinases (CAMK), sterile homologue kinases (STE),
CDK/MAPK/GSK3/CLK-family kinases (CMGC),
receptor guanylate cyclases (RGC), atypical protein
kinases (Atypical), and kinases that did not belong to
any group above (Other). After mapping them to the
GeneCards and the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) [14] databases, 538 genes had official
gene symbols and Entrez IDs (Supplementary Table S1).
Figure 2A shows the distribution of these 538 kinase
genes in 10 groups. Starting with these 538 kinase genes,
we systematically constructed a global human kinome
interactome map using the following data: a KSIN with
7346 pairs, a PPIN with 92,699 pairs, an atomic resolution
3DPPIN with 4278 pairs, and a drug-target interaction
network with 13,582 pairs (Supplementary Table S1 and
Figure 1). The collection of the human kinome and four
networks is available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/
kinomenetworkX/. Next, we systematically examined the
topological features and functional relationships of these
networks to better understand kinase inhibitor responses
and molecular networks of the human kinome.

Functional mapping of the human kinome
We compared the 538 kinase genes with each of the
following gene sets: 487 CGC genes, 1,855 known drug
target proteins (genes), 2,123 ODMGs, 2,714 MDGs, and
2,721 essential genes (Supplementary Table S1). Within
the current human kinome, 422 kinase genes (78.4%) are
found in at least one of these five gene sets, including
45 CGC genes, 126 drug target proteins (genes), 101
MDGs, 85 ODMGs and 386 essential genes (Figure 2).
This observation indicated that kinase genes tended to
be CGC genes more often as compared to MDGs (odds
ratio=2.6, p=1.3×10-6, Fisher’s exact test) or ODMGs
(p=8.3×10-6). Among the 45 CGC kinase genes, 28 kinases
have been approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for molecularly targeted cancer
treatment. In order to further our understanding of the
biological functions of the human kinome, we examined
the cellular component features of 538 kinases using the
ClueGO [15]. We found kinases tended to locate in the
plasma membrane integral region (p=9.0×10-9, two-sided
hypergeometric test), plasma membrane (p=6.1×10-8),
cytoskeletal region (p=3.5×10-5), cytoskeleton (p=3.5×104
), or cleavage furrow (p=4.5×10-3) (Supplementary
Table S2). It is not surprising that kinases are enriched
in membrane components, as the cell membrane is
a key location for signal transduction and cell-cell
communications.

phosphoproteome sites. In total, 36,576 phosphorylation
sites were found in 1,919 non-kinase substrate proteins in
KSIN, including 21,184 pS sites (57.9%), 8,812 pT sites
(24.1%), and 6,580 pY sites (18.0%) (Supplementary
Figure S1E).

We constructed a high-resolution KSIN using
a systems biology-based framework in Figure 1. The
current version of KSIN includes 7,346 experimentally
validated or literature-curated kinase-substrate interaction
(KSI) pairs connecting 379 kinases and 1,961 nonkinase substrate proteins (Supplementary Table S1).
The details of kinase genes categorized by each kinase
group are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. We further
collected high-resolution in vivo phosphorylation sites
from dbPTM3 [16] and PhosphositePlus [17], and used
the data to annotate each protein kinase and its substrate
protein. In total, we collected 173,460 non-redundant
phosphorylation sites in 18,610 proteins (Supplementary
Table S2). This collection included 94,693 phosphoserine
(pS) sites (54.6%), 44,023 phosphothreonine (pT)
sites (25.4%), and 34,744 phosphotyrosine (pY) sites
(20.0%) (Supplementary Figure S1C). Among these
phosphorylation sites, 10,374 sites were found in a total
of 490 kinases (91.1% of kinome), including 5,364 pS
sites (51.7%), 2,581 pT sites (24.9%), and 2,429 pY
sites (23.4%) (Supplementary Figure S1D). Next, we
compared the kinases and substrates in KSIN with their

Topological characteristics of KSIN
We visualized KSIN in Cytoscape and examined
its network topological characteristics in Figure 3. In
this network, 379 kinases were denoted by circles, and
1,961 non-kinase substrate proteins were denoted by
squares. A straightforward exploration of the network
revealed several major hubs, including PRKACA
(connectivity=333), CDK2 (255), AKT1 (234), CSNK2A1
(227), PRKAC (223), MAPK1 (194), SRC (163), MAPK3
(141), MAPK3 (124), and GSK3B (123), all of which were
involved in multiple substrate protein phosphorylation
reactions. An examination of the connectivity distribution
of KSIN showed that it follows a power-law distribution
(y=axb, a=380.1, b=-1.3), with an average connectivity of
6.3 and an average shortest path of 3.5 (Supplementary
Figure S1F).

Modularity characteristics

Supplementary Table S2 shows the results for the targeted
phosphorylation sites of the top 12 kinases that have
the highest connectivity in KSIN. We found kinases
recognized distinct sequence motifs (Figure 4A). For
example, a serine or threonine residue preceding a proline
(Ser/Thr-Pro) is a major regulatory phosphorylation motif
that plays crucial functions in a diverse array of cellular
processes.[22] Figure 4A showed several important
functional hubs, including CDK2, MAPK1, MAPK3,
and MAPK8 that harbored the conserved Ser/Thr-Pro
motif. Similarly, glycogen synthase kinase-2 (GSK3B)
is more likely to recognize and phosphorylate the first
serine in the conserved motif Ser-X-X-X-Ser-Pro [23].
The Ser/Thr-Pro-directed kinases play crucial roles in cell
cycle, transcription, and diverse signaling transduction
pathways as well as in Alzheimer’s disease and various
cancers [24]. For CSNK2A1, its +1 position has an Asp/
Glu (Figure 4A), confirming that CSNK2A1 is a SerAsp/Glu-directed kinase [25]. The -3 and -2 positions of
PRKACA, AKT1, PAK1, PRKCA, and PRKCD form

Network modules, also known as network
communities, represent groups of interconnected nodes
that typically have similar biological functions. We used
CFinder [18] to identify functional modules of KSIN.
A total of 21 functional modules (Supplementary Table
S2) were generated by CFinder (k-clique, k=4). The giant
module included 733 KSI pairs connecting 110 kinases
and 140 substrate proteins. Modules were further analyzed
for overlaps and correlations using the ModuLand
algorithm [19,20]. In total, we identified 89 overlapped
modules (Supplementary Figure S2A). The correlation of
89 modules is shown in Supplementary Figure S2B.

Substrate specificity of the human kinome
We examined sequence motifs of phosphorylation
site using a sequence logo analysis tool [21].

conserved phosphorylation consensus motifs, such as ArgArg-X-Ser/Thr and Arg/Lys-X-X-Ser/Thr [26]. Moreover,
distinct regulatory phosphorylation motifs were verified
by kinase-substrate co-crystal structures. The pocket of
phospho-CDK2-cyclinA3-peptide complex [27,28] tended
to accommodate proline at the +1 position (Figure 4B,C).
However, it should be noted that analyses here are limited
due to the incompleteness and inaccuracy of existing data.

(KDIN) in Figure 5. The bipartite graph analysis of KDIN
could provide a useful survey of the current status of kinase
inhibitor discovery and clinical applications. In KDIN, a
drug (square) and a kinase (circle) are linked if the kinase
is a known target of the drug (Figure 5). The average
connectivity (4.6) of 11 FDA approved small molecularly
targeted kinase inhibitors is significantly stronger than
that of 527 experimental drugs (1.2, p=1.6×10-8, Wilcoxon
test). The bipartite graph analyses showed that most FDAapproved kinase inhibitors often target the cancer kinome
through polypharmacology. For instance, dasatinib is an
oral dual ABL1 and SRC family tyrosine kinase inhibitor
for chronic myelogenous leukemia treatment. As shown
in Figure 5, dasatinib targets 9 protein kinases, including
ABL1, ABL2, EPHA2, KIT, PDEGFRB, FYN, SRC,
YES1, and LCK. Furthermore, a kinase may be targeted
by multiple drugs. For example, CDK2 binds 142
experimental drugs in DrugBank and TTD. Since most

Kinase-drug interaction network
We searched drugs that target any of the 538 kinases
from DrugBank [6] and Therapeutics Target Database
(TTD) [29] and found a total of 567 drugs targeting 126
kinases (Supplementary Table S2, as of April 30, 2013).
Then, we used these drugs and their target kinases to build
a bipartite graph of the kinase-drug interaction network

Figure 5: Kinase-drug interaction network. In this network, a drug node (square) and a target kinase node (circle) are connected

to each other by a grey edge if the target is annotated as a known interaction with the drug. The size of each node reflects its degree of
connectivity. Drug nodes (circles) are green (experimental drugs) or gold (FDA approved drugs). Kinase nodes (circles) are color-coded
according to the kinase groups (see Figure 2 legend).

development of a polypharmacological inhibitor would
be a promising strategy to improve clinical benefits for

proteins shared by DTPN and PPIN. Within these proteins,
438 (28.3%) were hubs, indicating a significant enrichment
of DTPN target proteins in PPIN hubs (p=1.3×10-14). The
same enrichment was found when 3DPPIN was compared
to DTPN (p=3.2×10-12). Collectively, drug target proteins
(e.g., target kinases) were more likely to be hubs in KSIN,
PPIN, and 3DPPIN.
The emerging use of network hubs as drug targets
has the following rationale [33]. Perturbation of hubs
by a drug would create cascading effects, leading to
functional changes in a major segment of the network. In
contrast, peripheral nodes (non-hubs) that are blocked by a
molecule would likely have only limited effects. However,
our analyses below revealed that selecting network hubs as
drug targets lead to a high risk of adverse drug reactions.
We compiled 527 ADRPs that are involved in adverse drug
reactions. When 527 ADRPs were manually matched to
PPIN, 441 proteins were found, among which 122 proteins
were hubs in PPIN (p=3.1×10-4, Table 1). In addition, the
ADRPs were significantly enriched as network hubs in
KSIN (p=2.0×10-5) and 3DPPIN (p=5.4×10-5). Therefore,
there is a high risk for adverse drug reactions when using
the hubs in the human protein interactome as drug targets.
To further investigate whether targeting a signaling
pathway is more effective, we used the ClueGO [15] to
identify KEGG pathways enriched with the 126 target
kinases. Three important signaling pathways were
identified: MAPK signaling pathway (including EGFR,
BRAF, PDGFR, MAPK1, TGFBR1, and RAF1, p=2.3×1015
, two-sided hypergeometric test, Supplementary Table

Topological properties of the human kinome
interactome
Do hubs in the protein interactome tend to be
drug targets? In KSIN, 468 proteins within the top 20%
of connectivity were selected as hubs. After manually
mapping, we found 116 target kinases in KSIN, of which
90 were hubs (p=3.6×10-43, Fisher’s exact test, Table 1). In
PPIN, 2,602 proteins within the top 20% of connectivity
were selected as hubs. After manual mapping, we found
125 target kinases, among which 90 target kinases were
hubs (p=2.5×10-35, Table 1). This target kinase enrichment
in hubs was observed in 3DPPIN as well (p=1.5×10-22).
Furthermore, we compiled 13,582 drug-target
interactions to construct a complementary drug target
protein network (DTPN). In DTPN, nodes are target
proteins, and two target proteins are connected if they
are both targeted by at least one common FDA-approved
or experimental drug [32]. This DTPN included 28,989
pairs connecting 1,811 target proteins. Statistical analysis
showed that DTPN target proteins were more likely KSIN
hubs (p=2.8×10-7, Table 1). There were 1,550 target

(genes) in KSIN, 40 of them were hubs, suggesting a
significant enrichment of drug resistance proteins in
KSIN hubs (p=1.1×10-3, Fisher’s test, Table 1). The
average connectivity (10.5) of the 124 drug resistance
proteins was significantly stronger than that of the 2,216
remaining proteins in KSIN (6.1, p=2.6×10-4, Wilcoxon
test, Supplementary Table S5). Furthermore, we found
a significant enrichment of anticancer drug resistance
proteins in PPIN hubs (137 hubs, p=3.0×10-12) and
3DPPIN hubs (58 hubs, p=3.2×10-8).
Next, we constructed a drug resistance network to
investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms of drug
responses to specific FDA-approved small molecular
kinase inhibitors (Supplementary Figure S3). The
calculation of a p-value for each drug-gene association
was described in a previous work [35]. Three kinase
inhibitors are approved for renal cell carcinoma treatment
by the FDA, including sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib
(Figure 6A). The kinase inert domain receptor (KDR) is
involved in resistance or sensitivity to sunitinib (p=1.9×104
), sorafenib (p=1.0×10-3), and pazopanib (p=1.0×10-3)
(Supplementary Table S5). The cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A), which encodes the CDK
inhibitory protein p16, was reported to be significantly
associated with sensitivity to five kinase inhibitors
(Supplementary Table S5): dasatinib (p=1.3×10-13),
erlotinib (p=4.1×10-8), imatinib (p=8.2×10-5), sunitinib
(p=5.0×10-3), sorafenib (p=6.0×10-3), and lapatinib
(p=7.0×10-3). Gefitinib, a classical EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, is approved to treat advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer. Recent work showed genes NRAS,
BRAF, KRAS, and PIK3R1 are involved in gefitinib
resistance (Figure 6B) [36]. In Figure 6C, most gefitinib
resistance genes are located on the EGFR signaling
pathway through the RAS/MEK/ERK or PI3K/PDK1/
AKT downstream pathways [34]. Collectively, selecting a
network hub as the drug target in the protein interactome
might create a high anticancer drug resistance risk.

MAPK, and KDR, p=1.3×10-12), and mTOR signaling
pathway (including BRAF, AKT1, RPS6KA1, and mTOR,
p=1.7×10-7).

Do kinases tend to be hubs in the human protein
interactome?
We manually matched 538 kinases to PPIN and then
constructed a kinase-protein interaction subnetwork. This
subnetwork included 14,238 pairs connecting 462 kinases
and 4,414 non-kinase proteins (Supplementary Table
S4). Among the 462 kinases, 209 were hubs in PPIN,
indicating a significant enrichment of kinases in PPIN hubs
(p=5.9×10-34, Table 1). The average connectivity of the
462 kinases was 33.2, which is significantly stronger than
that of the 12,181 non-kinases in PPIN (14.0, p<2.2×1016
, Wilcoxon test, Supplementary Table S4). We further
matched 538 kinases in 3DPPIN and found 271 kinases,
including 117 hubs (p=2.1×10-15, Table 1). The average
connectivity (6.0) of the 271 kinases is significantly
stronger than that of the 2,338 non-kinases in 3DPPIN
(3.0, p<2.2×10-16). Collectively, kinases are significantly
enriched as network hubs in the protein interactome.

Do hubs in KSIN tend to be hubs/bottlenecks in
the protein interactome?
We manually matched 2,340 proteins in KSIN to
PPIN. A total of 2,213 proteins (including 361 kinases
and 1,852 non-kinase substrates) were found, among
which 1,119 proteins (including 194 kinases and 925 nonkinases) were hubs in PPIN (p=3.6×10-275, Supplementary
Table S4). In addition, 965 proteins (including 169
kinases and 796 non-kinases) were bottlenecks in PPIN
(p=1.1×10-166). The average connectivity (9.8) of the 965
bottleneck proteins is significantly stronger than that of the
1,248 non-bottleneck proteins in KSIN (3.8, p<2.2×10-16).
These findings revealed that proteins in KSIN tended to be
bottlenecks in PPIN.

DISCUSSION
Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly
targeted kinase inhibitor therapeutics is a major obstacle
facing current cancer research [37]. Crosstalk and feedback
that are poorly understood in most cellular networks are
main contributors to resistance. Systems biology-based
modeling on the human kinome level might provide a
powerful network perspective and innovative tools to
address this challenge. In this study, we systematically
investigated the relationship between kinase inhibitors
and the gene products of the human kinome in the broader
context of the human kinase phosphorylation network
and the protein interactome. We focused on addressing
two questions. First, do kinases occupy a distinct
network topology in the human interactome? Second,
from a systems biology perspective, why do most tumors

Network topology of anticancer drug responseassociated genes
A systematic identification of anticancer drug
response markers in cancer cells is highly promising
for individualized cancer therapy [34]. In this study,
we sought to determine the network topology of drug
resistance genes in the protein interactome. We compiled
458 genes that are involved in sensitivity or resistance to
130 anticancer drugs from a previous work [35]. Among
the 458 drug resistance genes, 82 were CGC genes and
144 were essential genes (Supplementary Figure S4A).
We found 124 among the 458 drug resistance proteins

escape from any single kinase inhibition? We found
kinases significantly tended to be central hubs rather than
peripheral nodes in the protein interactome. The distinct
network centrality of kinases creates a high risk for the
evasion of single kinase target inhibition through adaptive
feedback or crosstalk within dynamic signaling networks.
Moreover, this hypothesis is further supported by the
systematic network and pathway analyses that anticancer
drug sensitivity proteins are significantly enriched as
hubs in the protein interactome. We further revealed that
the typical anticancer drug target selection strategy that
uses hubs as drug targets, might lead to a high risk for
adverse drug reactions. In summary, these findings provide
systems view of the human kinase interactions and kinase
inhibitor resistance mechanisms.
Phosphorylation-mediated signaling networks
play crucial roles in cellular physiology. Recent

protein microarray experiments have provided highthroughput data and facilitated the analyses of protein
phosphorylation networks [38]. Here, we constructed
a global and high-resolution kinase phosphorylation
network using an integrative computational framework.
We identified conserved regulatory phosphorylation
motifs, e.g., Ser-X-X-X-Ser-Pro, using a sequence logo
analysis. These conserved regulatory phosphorylation
motifs were verified by the kinase-substrate co-crystal
structures. Thus, we provided the evidence that the
proline direction of kinases is a common mechanism for
the conserved phosphorylation signaling pathways. The
data size used in this study is reasonable and includes
the data we were able to collect to date. However, some
important properties might not be captured among this
data due to knowledgebase incompleteness as well as the
standard static networks that are prevalent in this field.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Biological systems, e.g., the phosphorylation network,
are highly dynamic profiles that continuously respond to
a host of physical or physiological environments. So far,
the completeness and accuracy of the human interactome
is still a major obstacle. For example, the perturbation
dynamics of signaling networks have been extensively
investigated, including ~10,000 phosphorylation
reactions in yeast cells [39]. The size of the whole human
interactome was estimated to have ~650,000 interactions
[40]. Although two large networks were constructed
in this study, we still have a long way to decipher
the complexity of the human kinome interactome.
Advances in experimental measurement technologies
and computational methods would enable large-scale
screenings to fill in much of our missing knowledge in
the future.
Here, we systematically examined the kinase-drug
interaction network using a bipartite graph analysis. We
found target kinases are significantly enriched as central
hubs in the protein interactome. An inhibition or blocking
of hub nodes may lead to cascading effects compromising
the function of a major segment of the signaling networks
[33]. The development of high efficacy kinase inhibitors
that target hubs of the signaling networks is a typical
strategy for cancer drug discovery [41]. However,
network centrality of target kinases might create a high
risk of drug resistance, as hub proteins easily provide the
adaptive crosstalk or feedback within cellular networks.
In addition, we found the current selection of hubs
as drug targets might create a high risk for the adverse
drug reactions. Many promising drug candidates fail in
the last clinical trial phases due to a poor understanding
of the signaling pathways or drug-target interactions
that are involved in the mechanisms-of-action [42]. To
overcome this challenge, we urge researchers to expand
the knowledge of systems pharmacology through the
construction of network models [5,43]. Here, we found
most of the successful kinase inhibitors primarily target
the cancer kinome through polypharmacology. The
polypharmacology of kinase inhibitors would improve
clinical efficiency by inhibiting multiple kinases in the
signaling networks [5,33]. Thus, network-based modeling
potentially opens a new avenue for rational kinase inhibitor
discovery, e.g., “Allo-network drugs” development
[33,34]. The human kinome interactome we constructed
in this study, named Kinome NetworkX, is available
at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/kinomenetworkX/.
This comprehensive data source would serve as a useful
resource for the research community. Collectively, the
global human kinome interactome map provide a systems
biology perspective for the human kinome, and this map
is a useful resource for rational kinase inhibitor design in
individualized cancer therapy.

Construction of the human interactome

Kinase-substrate interaction network (KSIN)
In KSIN, a node denotes a kinase or its substrate
protein, and an edge denotes a phosphorylation reaction
between a kinase and its substrate protein. We collected
high-resolution KSI pairs from four databases: Phospho.
ELM [44], Human Protein Resource Database (HPRD)
[45], PhosphoNetworks [38,46], and PhosphoSitePlus
[17]. All genes were mapped to their Entrez ID based on
the NCBI [14] as well as their official gene symbols based
on GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/). Duplicated
KSI pairs and self-loops were removed. As a result, we
compiled 7,346 unique KSI pairs connecting 379 kinases
and 1,961 non-kinase substrate proteins. In addition, we
collected human phosphorylation site information from
the PhosphoSitePlus [17] and dbPTM3 [16] databases. In
total, we obtained 173,460 non-redundant phosphorylation
sites in 18,610 proteins.

Protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)
We downloaded human protein-protein interaction
(PPI) pairs from the Protein Interaction Network
Analysis (PINA) platform. PINA (v2.0, May 1, 2013) is
a comprehensive PPI database that integrates six largescale, manually curated public databases: IntAct, MINT,
BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, and MIPS MPact [47]. All proteincoding genes were mapped to the NCBI database. Genes
without an Entrez ID, duplicated PPI pairs, and self-loops
were excluded. In total, we obtained 92,699 unique PPI
pairs connecting 12,643 proteins.

Three-dimensional structural protein-protein
interaction network (3DPPIN)
We downloaded three-dimensional structural PPI
(3DPPI) pairs from the Instruct database [48]. The original
Instruct database contained 6,534 human 3DPPI pairs.
After excluding genes without Entrez IDs and 2,293 selfloops, we collected 4,278 3DPPI pairs connecting 2,609
proteins.
Drug-target interaction network We collected
the drug-target interactions from two famous drug
pharmacological databases: DrugBank [6] and TTD [29].
In total, we collected 13,582 drug-target interaction pairs
connecting 2,716 target proteins and 3,779 FDA-approved
and experimental drugs.

Gene set categories

systematically identified drug-sensitivity biomarkers
(genes) on 639 human tumor cell lines, which provided a
useful resource to probe drug sensitivity genes.

Mendelian disease genes (MDGs)

Measurement of network topology

We downloaded 2,714 MDGs from the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database
(December 2012) [49]. The OMIM contained 4,132 genedisease association pairs connecting 2,716 disease genes in
3,294 Mendelian diseases or disorders (December 2012).

We calculated connectivity (degree) and
betweenness centrality values using the Cytoscape
(v3.0) [56]. We defined “hubs” as those nodes that were
ranked at the top 20% of the connectivity distribution
and “bottleneck” as those nodes that were ranked at the
top 20% of the betweenness centrality value distribution
[50,57]. We identified network modules and communities
using CFinder [18] (k-clique, k=4) and the ModuLand
algorithm [19,20]. CFinder was used to locate and
visualize overlapping, densely interconnected groups of
nodes in undirected graphs [18]. The ModuLand algorithm
was used to identify hierarchical layers of overlapping
network modules and community centrality [19,20].

Orphan disease-causing mutant genes (ODMGs)
We collected 2,123 ODMGs from a previously
published work [50]. According to the United States Rare
Disease Act of 2002, an orphan disease is defined as a rare
disease that affects fewer than 200,000 inhabitants, which
is equivalent to approximately 6.5 patients per 10,000
inhabitants [51].

Functional enrichment analysis

Cancer Gene Census (CGC) genes

We used ClueGo [15], a user-friendly Cytoscape
plug-in, for the enrichment analysis of genes in Gene
Ontology cellular components or KEGG canonical
pathways. A two-sided hypergeometric test was performed
to estimate statistical significance.

We collected 487 cancer genes from the Cancer
Gene
Census
(CGC,
http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/
cancergenome/projects/census/). CGC genes are wellcurated and have been widely used as a reference cancer
gene set in many cancer-related projects [52,53].

Statistical analysis and network visualization

Essential genes

All statistical tests (e.g., Fisher’s exact test and
Wilcoxon’s test) were performed on the R platform (v3.01,
http://www.r-project.org/). All network visualization and
related network topological parameters were presented
using Cytoscape (v3.0) [56].

We downloaded 2,721 essential genes from the
Online GEne Essentiality (OGEE) database [54]. Essential
genes, whose knockouts result in cell inviability or
embryonic lethality, are a crucial component to the study
of biological systems robustness and effective drug target
identification [54].
