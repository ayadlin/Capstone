BACKGROUND: Advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma (BTA) has been a rare but fatal cancer. If unresectable, palliative chemotherapy improved the quality and length of life, but to the authors’ knowledge,
prognostic factors in such patients have not been well established to date. In the current study, prognostic factors were investigated in patients with advanced BTA receiving first-line palliative chemotherapy. METHODS: Data from 213 patients with advanced BTA who were in prospective phase 2 or
retrospective studies from September 2000 through October 2007 were used. RESULTS: With a median
follow-up duration of 29.7 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 7.3 months (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 6.3 months-8.3 months). A Cox proportional hazards model indicated that metastatic disease (hazards ratio [HR], 1.521; P ¼ .011), intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (HR, 1.368;
P ¼ .045), liver metastasis (HR, 1.845; P < .001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(HR, 1.707; P < .001), and alkaline phosphatase level (IU/L) (HR, 1.001; P < .001) were statistically significant independent predictors of poor prognosis. Patients were classified into 3 risk groups based on the
prognostic index (PI), which was constructed using the regression coefficients of each variable. The median
OS was 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.6 months-13.5 months) for the low-risk group (PI  1.5; n ¼ 67), 7.3 months
(95% CI, 5.7 months-8.9 months) for the intermediate-risk group (PI > 1.5 but  2.2; n ¼ 75), and 3.6 months
(95% CI, 2.9 months-4.1 months) for the high-risk group (PI > 2.2; n ¼ 70 [P < .001]). CONCLUSIONS: Five
prognostic factors in patients with advanced BTA were identified. The predictive model based on PI
appears to be promising and may be used for the management of individual patients and to guide the

Advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma (BTA) is a rare but fatal cancer. BTA includes a heterogeneous
group of cancers: intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (IHCCC), gallbladder cancer (GBC), extrahepatic
bile duct carcinoma (EHBDC), and ampulla of Vater cancer (AoVC). In the United States, BTAs affect

approximately 12,000 people annually and the incidence
of IHCCC has increased in recent years.1 In Korea, BTA
accounts for approximately 4.8% of all malignant neoplasms and is estimated to be the seventh most common
cancer.2 Complete resection is the only cure for BTA, but
only 10% of patients present with early stage disease and
are candidates for surgical resection.3 In addition, among
patients who undergo curative surgery, recurrence rates
are extremely high. For patients with unresectable
advanced or recurrent BTA, 5-fluorouracil-based palliative chemotherapy, which can improve the quality and
length of life,4,5 is the mainstay of treatment.3
To our knowledge, because of the rarity of BTA and
the heterogeneity of the patient population, there are no
well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials.
Most trials published to date have been small phase 2 studies. Furthermore, only a minority of BTA patients treated
with chemotherapy experience favorable responses, and
few achieve long-term survival. Therefore, the confirmation of a standard therapeutic regimen and the identification of new chemotherapeutic agents is a high priority.
In designing and interpreting phase 2 or 3 clinical
trials for the treatment of BTA, it is important to identify
factors associated with patient survival. In particular, phase
3 trials that include survival as a primary endpoint must
account for prognostic factors so that treatment groups are
comparable and trial outcomes are properly interpreted. In
addition, adequate assessment of patient survival will also
aid patients and physicians in their clinical judgment. Several studies have investigated prognostic factors associated
with survival from BTA, but the majority addressed only
the risk of disease recurrence after curative resection.6-12
To our knowledge, only 1 small study to date has investigated prognostic factors for patients with advanced GBC
and EHBDC who received palliative chemotherapy.13
The objective of the current study was to evaluate
the prognostic factors that affect the overall survival (OS)
of patients with BTA and to establish a prognostic prediction model for patients with advanced BTA who receive
palliative chemotherapy.

were included in a retrospective cohort study from September 2000 through October 2007. The first prospective
study was a phase 2 trial (capecitabine plus cisplatin protocol) in which 42 patients were treated with oral capecitabine (at a dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice per day from Day 1
to Day 14) and cisplatin (at a dose of 60 mg/m2 intravenously at Day 1 every 3 weeks).14 The second phase 2
study (gemcitabine plus capecitabine protocol) was a prospective study in which 38 patients received gemcitabine
(at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 intravenously for 30 minutes on
Days 1, 8, and 15) and oral capecitabine (at a dose of
830 mg/m2 twice per day from Day 1 to Day 21 every
4 weeks).15 The cohort study was a retrospective review of
133 patients who were treated with oral S-1 monotherapy
(at a dose of 40 mg/m2 twice per day from Day 1 to Day
14 every 3 weeks) and who fulfilled the preset eligibility
criteria.16 The inclusion criteria for both prospective studies were as follows: 1) histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract; 2) distant
metastases or locally advanced disease that was not eligible
for curative surgery; 3) ages 18 to 75 years; 4) Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or better; 5) presence of measurable lesions; 6) no
serious or uncontrolled concomitant medical illness; and
7) adequate bone marrow and organ function (absolute
neutrophil count  2000/lL, platelet count  100,000/
lL, and serum creatinine  1.5 mg/dL). The eligibility
criteria for the retrospective study were not significantly
different. However, in the retrospective study, patients
with elevated transaminase and hyperbilirubinemia (total
bilirubin  2 mg/dL) associated with biliary obstruction
caused by the disease were included so that the efficacy
and safety of S-1 monotherapy for patients with impaired
liver function could be assessed. In addition, patients with
evaluable disease, but not measurable disease based on
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor criteria,
were included because the primary endpoint of the retrospective study was OS.

and recurrence with distant metastasis); histologic differentiation; sites of metastases; number of metastases;
baseline biochemical parameters, including white blood
cell (WBC) count (/lL), hemoglobin concentration
(Hb) (g/dL), platelet count (/lL), bilirubin (mg/dL),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (reference value, 40-120 IU/
L), calcium (mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
(IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (IU/L), albumin (g/dL), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9)
(reference value, 0-37 U/mL); experience of biliary
decompression procedures; chemotherapy regimens;
date of treatment; and date and cause of death or date of
the last follow-up.
The primary endpoint was OS, defined as the date
from the first chemotherapeutic cycle to the date of
death. The Kaplan-Meier algorithm was used to estimate
OS. We compared survival using the Cox proportional
hazards model according to clinicopathologic characteristics including age, sex, ECOG performance status, disease status at palliative chemotherapy, primary tumor
site, metastasis site, laboratory values, chemotherapeutic
regimen, and whether biliary obstruction was present.
All potential prognostic factors with a probability value
 .20 on univariate analyses were entered into the multivariable Cox models. The final models were determined
by backward elimination. Schoenfeld residuals and the
log (-log [survival rate]) were used to verify that the proportional hazards assumptions were not violated. The
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for
Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and S-plus 2000
(Mathsoft Inc, Seattle, Wash) were used for statistical
analyses.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 59
years (range, 21 years-83 years) and 120 patients (56.3%)
were men. Primary sites of disease were IHCCC (85
patients; 39.9%), GBC (72 patients; 33.8%), EHBDC
(39 patients; 18.3%), and AoVC (17 patients; 8.0%).
Forty-nine patients (23.0%) had biliary obstruction and
underwent drainage procedures, such as percutaneous
4150

transhepatic biliary drainage or endoscopic retrograde
biliary stent. Fifty-nine patients (27.7%) received secondline chemotherapy.

Survival Distribution
At the time of analysis (June 2008), 192 patients had died
(90.1%) and the median OS time was 7.3 months (95%
CI, 6.3 months-8.3 months) (Fig. 1), with a median follow-up duration of 29.7 months (95% CI, 16.9 months42.5 months). The 6-month survival rate was 57.5%, and
the 1-year survival rate was 28.5%.

Univariate Survival Analysis
A univariate analysis indicated that disease status (metastatic [initially metastatic or disease recurrence with
distant metastasis] vs locally advanced [initially locally
advanced or locoregionally recurrent]), primary site
(IHCCC vs GBC or EHBDC or AoVC), peritoneal metastasis, liver metastasis, bone metastasis, lung metastasis,
ECOG performance status, WBC counts, Hb levels, total
bilirubin levels, ALP values, AST values, albumin levels,
and corrected calcium levels17 were statistically associated
with OS (Table 2). Age, gender, chemotherapy regimen,
and CA 19-9 values were found to have no influence on
patient survival.

Multivariable Analysis, Prognostic Index,
and Risk Groups
Among the parameters considered, initial disease status,
primary tumor site (IHCCC vs GBC or EHBDC or
AoVC), ECOG performance status, liver metastasis, and
ALP values were found to be significant prognostic factors (Table 3). Of the 213 patients, we had complete
data for 212 patients (99.5%) with regard to 5 parameters and therefore these patients were included in the
prognosis prediction model. For the clinical application
of these findings, a prognostic index (PI) was calculated
based on the regression coefficients derived from the 5
variables identified by multivariable analysis. The index
equation was as follows: 0.42 X (0, locally advanced disease; 1, metastatic disease) þ 0.31  (0, extrahepatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma; 1, IHCCC) þ 0.61 X (0, no

DISCUSSION
The identification of factors that predict survival from
advanced BTA can help investigators predict life expectancy, guide treatment plans, analyze clinical studies, and
design future clinical trials. To the best of our knowledge,
previous studies of predictors of survival from BTA for
the most part examined postoperative patients and were
not confined to patients who were undergoing palliative
chemotherapy.6-12 In the current study, we identified
5 independent prognostic factors for survival from
advanced BTA: metastatic disease status, IHCCC,
ECOG performance status, liver metastasis, and ALP elevation. We also calculated a simple PI based on the regression coefficient and devised prognostic groups, which
indicated that patients in different risk groups had markedly different survival rates. The means of determining all
5 prognostic factors are readily available to treating physicians before chemotherapy, and we expect that their use
will aid in clinical decision making and risk stratification.
To our knowledge, this is the first report that systemically
identifies prognostic factors in a large subset of patients
with advanced BTA. However, future studies that use
independent data sets are needed to verify the results of
the current study.
BTA can arise anywhere in the biliary tree and
includes IHCCC, GBC, EHBDC, and AoVC. There is
an indication of location-related pathogenetic differences
in BTAs, and these may be associated with different
responses to chemotherapy and overall prognosis.18

FIGURE 2. Kaplan-Meier survival curves according to prognostic groups are shown. The low-risk group (solid line)
(prognostic index of  1.5; n ¼ 67), intermediate-risk group
(dash-dot line) (prognostic index of > 1.5 but  2.2; n ¼ 75),
and high-risk group (dotted line) prognostic index of > 2.2;
n ¼ 70) showed marked survival differences (P < .001).

However, there has been debate regarding differences in the
prognoses of patients with different types of BTA. The
results of the current study confirm that IHCCC predicts
poor OS, as suggested in our previous report.14,16 Several
other studies reported results similar to ours,14,19-22 but
1 study reported poorer outcomes for patients with EHBDC
(especially GBC)23 and another study reported no prognostic differences in patients with different types of BTC.24
We identified metastasis to the liver as an independent factor that was predictive of poor prognosis. Similar
results have been reported for gastric cancer and urothelial
cancers.25-27 In the current study, elevated ALP was found
to be an independent prognostic factor of survival from
advanced BTA. In other malignancies such as breast,
esophagogastric, and colorectal cancer, elevated ALP
was also reported to be an independent prognostic
factor.25,28,29 In the study of Chau et al,25 elevated ALP
and liver metastasis were found to be independent prognostic factors in patients with advanced gastric cancer, as
in the current study. It has been suggested that elevated
ALP reflects metastatic tumor burden rather than the
presence or absence of liver metastasis. Poor ECOG performance status is a simple metric, but is a robust prognostic factor for a variety of malignancies.13,26,30-32 As
with those previous studies, we found that poor ECOG
performance status predicts a low rate of survival in
patients with advanced BTA.

Saisho et al13 analyzed prognostic factors for survival
in 65 patients with advanced BTA (with the exception of
IHCCC) who were receiving palliative chemotherapy.
Their univariate analysis indicated that primary tumor
location of EHBDC (but not GBC), poor performance
status, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) elevation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation
were significant. Their multivariate analysis indicated that
poor performance status, CRP elevation, hypoalbuminemia, LDH elevation, and male gender were significant.
There are several reasons why some of the results of the
Saisho et al13 study differ from those of the current study.
First, they did not include metastatic site and ALP as variables. Second, their study included no patients with
IHCCC, whereas IHCCC was the most common BTA
subtype in our patient population.
Contrary to our expectation, we found that CA 19-9
elevation was not an independent prognostic factor. We
also dichotomized this variable by applying an upper normal limit of 37 U/mL or its median value (76 U/mL), but
the results indicated that CA 19-9 elevation was not a significant prognostic factor (data not shown), as in the study
of Saisho et al13
S-1 is a novel oral fluoropyrimidine that is comprised of tegafur, 5-choloro-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine
(CDHP), and potassium oxonate (Oxo). S-1 has shown
potent antitumor activity against various solid tumors in
clinical studies.33 A recent multicenter phase 2 trial of S-1
monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with
advanced BTA achieved an overall response rate of 35%, a
stable disease rate of 42.5%, and a median OS of 9.4
months. Toxicities were generally mild.34 A retrospective
analysis of our center’s experience with S-1 monotherapy
in patients with advanced biliary cancer16 revealed an
overall response rate of 13.3% and an overall disease control rate of 55.8%. The median OS was 6.9 months.
Although the limited number of patients in our
study (n ¼ 213) hinders proper interpretation because of
the lack of adequate statistical power, we found that chemotherapeutic regimens did not affect OS (P ¼ .12). A
systemic review of 2810 patients with advanced BTAs
who were enrolled in clinical trials (predominantly phase
2) indicated that combination chemotherapy was better
than monotherapy, and that a 2-drug combination of
fluoropyrimidines or gemcitabine plus a platinum
compound was better than other combinations.35
4153

Original Article

Gemcitabine plus a platinum agent for BTA patients was
reported to be the most effective treatment. However, this
pooled analysis of heterogeneous phase 2 clinical trials
(which had different eligibility criteria) did not consider primary tumor site and differences in treatment schedules, and
therefore the conclusions should be viewed with caution.35
To the best of our knowledge, no standard regimen for the
treatment of patients with advanced BTA has been established to date, and therefore chemotherapeutic regimens
must be compared in future prospective trials. Our center is
currently performing randomized phase 2 screening trials
that compare S-1 plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin for treatment of patients with advanced BTA.
There are several limitations to the current study.
First, we used retrospective analysis and therefore we
could not include information that had not been precisely
documented (eg, weight loss before treatment, presence
and intensity of cancer pain, cancer cachexia, and quality
of life). Some of these factors may significantly affect survival from BTA. For example, cancer cachexia is a wellknown negative prognostic factor for lung cancer.32 Second, we could only include laboratory tests that were routinely performed. For example, LDH and CRP levels have

comparison with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
Ann Surg Oncol. 2007;14:3195-3201.

For advanced BTA patients receiving palliative chemotherapy, we identified 5 independent prognostic factors
for OS: metastatic disease status, IHCCC, liver metastasis, ECOG performance status, and ALP values. We suggest that these factors could be used in prognostic models
to determine treatment strategy and to aid in the design of
future clinical trials, but these findings need to be validated in an independent data set before application.
