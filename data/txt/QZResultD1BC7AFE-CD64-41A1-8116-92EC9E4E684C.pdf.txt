ABSTRACT
LincRNA-p21 is a downstream long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcript of p53.
LincRNA-p21 serves as a repressor in p53-dependent transcriptional responses and
participates in diverse biological processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle, metabolism
and pluripotency. However, the role of lincRNA-p21 in human hepatocellular carcinoma
remains to be defined. Here in this work, we demonstrated that lincRNA-p21 acted
as a tumor suppressive lncRNA in human hepatocellular carcinoma. We firstly found
the downregulation of lincRNA-p21 level in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues,
and showed that low expression of lincRNA-p21 was associated with high disease
stage and predicted poor survival. Further we showed that lincRNA-p21 knockdown
promoted proliferation and colony formation of HepG2, Huh7 and Bel-7042 cells
in vitro, while lincRNA-p21 overexpression obtained oppose results. Using tumor
xenograft experiments, we also demonstrated that lincRNA-p21 inhibited HepG2 cell
growth in vivo and lincRNA-p21 contributed to sorafenib-induced growth regression of
HepG2 cell in vivo. Further mechanism analysis revealed that lincRNA-p21 promoted
ER stress both in vitro and in vivo, which facilitated apoptosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. Finally, we demonstrated that ER stress accounted for lincRNA-p21
effects on apoptosis, proliferation and in vivo growth of hepatocellular carcinoma.
These findings implicate that lincRNA-p21 is a potential prognostic factor and
therapeutic target for human hepatocellular carcinoma.

17-AAG, radicicol, and MAL3–101 [5]. The contribution
of ER stress to HCC has been proposed repeatedly [6,
7], however, high activation of ER stress by sorafenib
could induce apoptosis and growth arrest in established
or advanced HCC [8, 9]. Similar situation was observed
for marine prostanoid, curcumin, and genistein [10–12].
The mechanism by which sorafenib induces ER stress and
HCC cell apoptosis is still elusive.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently
been found to be pervasively transcribed in the human
genome. Aberrant expression of several lncRNAs was
found to be involved in the carcinogenesis of human
HCC [13, 14]. The p53-regulated long noncoding RNA
lincRNA-p21 has been proposed to act in trans via
several mechanisms ranging from repressing genes in
the p53 transcriptional network to regulating mRNA

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes more
than 500,000 deaths each year worldwide [1]. However,
measures aiming at preventing HCC development in these
patients are limited [2]. In addition, current therapies for
HCC often obtain poor long-term outcome due to drug
resistance with elusive mechanisms [3]. These facts
prompt us to identify novel molecular mechanisms for
hepatocellular carcinoma development and drug resistance.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has emerged as a
major site of cellular homeostasis regulation, particularly
in the unfolded protein response, which plays a major role
in cancer and many other diseases [4]. Several drugs that
activate ER stress have been approved for preclinical and
clinical use. These drugs include sorafenib, eeyarestatin,

translation and protein stability [15]. The physiological
and pathological functions of lincRNA-p21 were
identified gradually. For instance, Yang et al. [16]
reported lincRNA-p21 as a regulator for the Warburg
effect and also implicated lincRNA-p21 as a valuable
therapeutic target for cancer. Wu et al. [17] showed
that lincRNA-p21 regulated neointima formation,
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, apoptosis,
and atherosclerosis by enhancing p53 activity.
LincRNA-p21 function in pluripotency was also
been identified [18, 19]. Here in the present work, we
identified lincRNA-p21 as a negative regulator for HCC
development and drug resistance.

The above findings strongly implicated the participation
of lincRNA-p21 in human HCC, which prompted us to study
the functions of lincRNA-p21 in HCC. We first performed
experiments to investigate whether lincRNA-p21 could affect
cellular behaviors of liver cancer cells in vitro. We knocked
down lincRNA-p21 by lentivirus-mediated shRNAs in liver
cancer cell lines (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S2).
Four shRNAs were tested and the first and third shRNAs
were selected for further investigation for their relative
high knockdown efficiency (Figure 3A). We found that
lincRNA-p21 knockdown promoted the proliferation of
HepG2 cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure  S3A
and S3B). LincRNA-p21 knockdown also facilitated
proliferation of Huh7 and Bel-7042 cells (Figure 3C
and 3D). Further, we investigated whether lincRNA-p21
regulated cellular colony formation of liver cancer cells. The
results demonstrated the negative effects of lincRNA-p21 on
colony formation of HepG2 (Figure 3E and Supplementary
Figure S3C), Huh7 (Figure 3F) and Bel-7042 (Figure 3G)
cells. We also overexpressed lincRNA-p21 in liver cancer
cells and found that lincRNA-p21 overexpression inhibited
proliferation and cellular colony formation of HepG2, Huh7
and Bel-7042 cells (Figure 4A–4G). These findings indicate
that lincRNA-p21 inhibits liver cancer cell proliferation and
colony formation.

RESULTS
LincRNA-p21 is down-regulated in human
hepatocellular carcinoma
To investigate the potential functions of
lincRNA-p21 in human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), we firstly tested the expression profile of
this lincRNA in normal liver tissues and tissues from
HCC. The results showed that lincRNA-p21 level was
significantly reduced in tissues from HCC than that from
normal liver tissues (Figure 1A). We also tested the
expression of other lncRNAs (HULC, H19, MALAT-1,
TUC338, and HOTTIP) that are reported in HCC
[20–24]. All of these lncRNAs were up-regulated
in HCC (Supplementary Figure S1), which was
different from lincRNA-p21. Therefore, we focused on
lincRNA-p21 in the present work. The expression of
lincRNA-p21 in tumor and adjacent tissues was also
analyzed. Markedly, lincRNA-p21 level in tumor tissues
was lower than that of adjacent tissues (Figure 1B). We
also found the low level of lincRNA-p21 in liver cancer
cell lines compared to normal human hepatocytes
(Figure 1C). Further, we investigated whether
lincRNA-p21 was correlated with clinical markers
for HCC. We analyzed the serum levels of alphafetoprotein (AFP) in normal donors and HCC patients,
and found the high levels of AFP in patients with HCC
(Figure 1D). Linear regression analysis implicated the
significant but negative correlation between serum AFP
level and tissue lincRNA-p21 level (Figure 1E). These
data indicate the potential participation of lincRNA-p21
in human hepatocellular carcinoma. To further confirm
this correlation, we analyzed whether lincRNA-p21
predicted patients’ survival. The results showed that
low lincRNA-p21 predicted poor overall and diseasefree survival in patients with HCC (Figure 2A and 2B).
In addition, we found that low level of lincRNA-p21
was associated with higher tumor grade (p = 0.0166)
and stage (p = 0.0023), and vascular invasion
(p = 0.0209; Table 1).

LincRNA-p21 inhibits liver cancer cell growth
and drug resistance in vivo
We next studied whether lincRNA-p21 also regulated
in vivo growth of liver cancer cells. We performed tumor
xenograft experiments and knocked down lincRNA-p21.
LincRNA-p21 knockdown did not induce any toxicity in
mice. We found that lincRNA-p21 knockdown facilitated
the in vivo growth of HepG2 cells (Figure 5A and 5B). In
consistence, lincRNA-p21 overexpression inhibited growth
of HepG2 cells in vivo (Figure 5C and 5D). These results
demonstrated lincRNA-p21 acted as a negative regulator
for liver cancer cell growth in vivo. Another question we
were interested was whether low lincRNA-p21 contributed
to drug resistance. Therefore, we used the clinical drug
sorafenib, which was reported to induce apoptosis of liver
cancer cells partly through inducing ER stress [8, 25].
Firstly, we found that sorafenib could induce the expression
of lincRNA-p21 in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary
Figure S4A and S4B). Sorafenib treatment did not induce
any toxicity in mice but inhibited in vivo growth of HepG2
cells significantly. However, when lincRNA-p21 was
knocked down, sorafenib was unable to repress tumor
growth (Figure 5E–5F).These findings implicated that
lincRNA-p21 downregulation may contribute to clinical
tumor growth and drug resistance.

wanted to know whether this contribution depended upon
ER stress. We analyzed ER stress markers and found the
positive correlation between lincRNA-p21 levels and ER
stress markers (IRE1, CHOP, and GRP78) in tissues from
HCC (Figure 6A–6C). In HepG2 cells, overexpression
of lincRNA-p21 induced expression of IRE1, CHOP and
GRP78 (Figure 6D). We also found the upregulation of IRE,
CHOP and GRP78 protein level and hyper phosphorylation
of eIF2α in HepG2 cells overexpressed with lincRNA-p21
(Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure S5). We also tested
the activation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic
reticulum kinase (PERK), which is responsible for
phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2α, We found that
lincRNA-p21 could up-regulate the phosphorylation level
of PERK (Supplementary Figure S6). Finally, we studied
the effect of lincRNA-p21 on ER stress in vivo. In consistent
with the in vitro findings, lincRNA-p21 overexpression

Induction of ER stress is one of the important
pathways for clinical drugs to induce liver cancer cell
apoptosis and repress carcinoma development [8, 10, 11,
26]. Sorafenib is a small molecule that inhibits tumorcell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis and increases
the rate of apoptosis in a wide range of tumor models. In
preclinical experiments, sorafenib has anti-proliferative
activity in liver-cancer cell lines, and it reduces tumor
angiogenesis and tumor-cell signaling and increases tumorcell apoptosis in a mouse xenograft model of human HCC
[27]. One of the major mechanisms by which sorafenib
inhibits liver cancer survival is by inducing ER stress [8,
9]. As we showed the contribution of lincRNA-p21 to
sorafenib-induced repression of tumor growth, we next

activated ER stress by up-regulating the transcription of
ER stress markers (Figure 6F–6G and Supplementary
Figure S7). In addition, as reported by previous findings,
sorafenib induced ER stress in vivo (Figure 7A–7D) and
in liver cancer cell lines (Figure 7E–7G). Interestingly,
lincRNA-p21 knockdown blocked sorafenib effects on
ER stress both in vivo (Figure 7A–7D and Supplementary
Figure S8A) and in vitro (Figure 7E–7G and Supplementary
Figure S8B–S8D), indicating that lincRNA-p21 contributes
to sorafenib-induced ER stress.

Supplementary Figure S9), which is the main source of
ROS, is significantly decreased in HCC and liver cancer
cell lines compared to immortalized normal cell lines and
adjacent non-tumor tissues [28]. These results indicated that
ROS may be involved in lincRNA-p21-induced ER stressmediated apoptosis.

ER stress contributes to lincRNA-p21 effects on
hepatocellular carcinoma
The above results demonstrated that lincRNA-p21
regulated tumor growth, apoptosis and ER stress. One
question remained unknown was whether ER stress
accounted for lincRNA-p21-induced apoptosis and growth
arrest. Therefore, we inhibited ER stress with salubrinal, a
reported inhibitor for phosphorylation of eIF2α, in HepG2
cells (Figure 9A). Salubrinal treatment significantly
rescued lincRNA-p21-induced apoptosis of HepG2
cells (Figure 9B). Significantly, salubrinal also inhibited
lincRNA-p21-mediated growth inhibition of HepG2 cells
in vitro and in vivo (Figure 9C and 9D). These findings
demonstrated that ER stress, at least in part, contributes to
lincRNA-p21-induced apoptosis and growth arrest.

LincRNA-p21 induces apoptosis of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells
High level of ER stress can lead to apoptosis of
liver cancer cells [8], therefore, we next studied whether
lincRNA-p21 induced HCC cell apoptosis. We found
that lincRNA-p21 overexpression induced apoptosis of
HepG2 cells (Figure 8A and 8B). Similar results were
observed in Huh7 and Bel-7042 cells (Figure 8B). What’s
more, we showed that lincRNA-p21 knockdown blocked
sorafenib-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells (Figure 8C). As
lincRNA-p21 was reported to regulate p53 downstream genes
expression [17], we also investigated whether lincRNA-p21
affected these genes expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.
We found that lincRNA-p21 knockdown inhibited
sorafenib-induced expression of p53 downstream genes,
including Bax, Puma, Mdm2, and Noxa (Figure 8D–8G).
These findings indicated that lincRNA-p21 contributed to
sorafenib-induced apoptosis. ER stress induced apoptosis
is mainly mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Therefore, we tested whether lincRNA-p21 regulates cellular
ROS level. We found that that lincRNA-p21 overexpression
could significantly up-regulated total ROS level (~3.4 fold,
Supplementary Figure S9). In addition, lincRNA-p21 also
up-regulated the expression of dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1,

DISCUSSION
Using in vitro and in vivo evidence, we demonstrate
here that lincRNA-p21 serves as a suppressor for HCC
development and drug resistance partly by activating ER
stress. We first show the downregulation of lincRNA-p21 in
patients with HCC, which is correlated with higher disease
stage and poor survival. And then we demonstrate that
lincRNA-p21 inhibits growth of liver cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo. Our mechanism analysis reveals that lincRNA-p21
activates ER stress and mediates sorafenib-induced ER stress,
apoptosis and growth arrest. Finally, we provide evidence that

lincRNA-p21 effects on liver cancer apoptosis and growth
partly depends upon induction of ER stress.
LincRNA-p21 is directly induced by p53 to play
a critical role in the p53 transcriptional responses [15].
Both protein and mRNA targets for lincRNA-p21 have
been identified [15, 29]. Previous reports showed the
involvement of lincRNA-p21 in cell cycle [19], Warburg
effect [16], and cell survival [17], and these properties
implicating functional roles of lincRNA-p21 in carcinoma.
Chou et al. [30] reported the involvement of lincRNA-p21
in mammary cancer cells through control of HuR/elavL1
expression. In colon cancer tissues, lincRNA-p21
is significantly down-regulated [31, 32]. In human
HCC, lincRNA-p21 level was also down-regulated.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The expression level of lincRNA-p21 was negatively
correlated with AFP serum level, and low lincRNA-p21
level predicted poor overall and disease-free survival.
Therefore, lincRNA-p21 could serve as a prognostic
factor for favorable outcome. We used three HCC cell
lines to study the function of lincRNA-p21 in vitro and
in vivo. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function
experiments provided evidence that lincRNA-p21 was a
tumor suppressor lincRNA, and treatments that activate
lincRNA-p21 may be promising for HCC therapy.
Here we identified a new biological process that
lincRNA-p21 participates in. We found that lincRNA-p21
could activate ER stress by increasing the expression of
IRE1, CHOP and GRP78. However, in the reported targets

of lincRNA-p21, none of these genes were observed [15],
indicating that lincRNA-p21 may regulate ER stress
indirectly. These finding identified new biological function of
lincRNA-p21 other than metabolism, and cell reprogramming
[15, 16, 19, 29]. However, how lincRNA-p21 regulates ER
stress remains to be further explained.
Sorafenib is a clinical drug for HCC [25]. Previous
reports indicated that sorafenib induce apoptosis and
growth arrest of HCC cells partly through activating ER
stress [5–9]. However, the underlying mechanism remains
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

largely unexplored. We identified here lincRNA-p21
contributed to sorafenib-induced ER stress and apoptosis.
Knockdown of lincRNA-p21 blocked sorafenib effects
on ER stress, apoptosis and growth inhibition, indicating
lincRNA-p21 low expression is one of the reasons for drug
resistance in HCC and high level of lincRNA-p21 may
predict favorable outcome post sorafenib therapy. We also
found that sorafenib induced expression of p53 downstream
genes, Puma, Mdm2, Noxa and Bax, which was blocked
by lincRNA-p21 knockdown. Therefore, lincRNA-p21 may

also target p53 to induce apoptosis as previously reported
[17]. Previous reports show that lincRNA-p21 increases
following X-ray treatment, and enforced expression of the
lincRNA enhances the sensitivity of radiotherapy for CRC
by promoting cell apoptosis [32]. These findings implicate
that up-regulation of lincRNA-p21 may contribute to drug
treatment and radiotherapy.
In conclusion, we identify lincRNA-p21 as a
suppressor for HCC growth and drug resistance through
ER stress, and further explain how sorafenib regulates ER
stress and HCC development. LincRNA-p21 may serve as
a prognostic factor for outcome and drug resistance.

cancer cells were suspended in 1.5 ml complete medium
supplemented with 0.45% low melting point agarose
(Invitrogen # 16520–050). The cells were placed in 35 mm
tissue culture plates containing 1.5 ml complete medium
and agarose (0.75%) on the bottom layer. The cells were
cultured for 14 days. Cell colonies were stained with
0.005% crystal violet and analyzed using a microscope.
The colony number in each well was calculated.

polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins
were transferred to PVDF membranes, which were then
blocked with 5% milk for 2 hours. The membranes were
then probed with primary antibody for IRE1 (Abcam #
ab37073), CHOP (Cell Signaling Technology # 2895),
GAPDH (Santa Cruz #sc32233), GRP78 (Abcam #
ab32618), p-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology # 9721),
eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology # 3597), DUOX1
(Abcam #ab78919), p-PERK (Cell Signaling Technology
#3179), PERK (Cell Signaling Technology #3192) at 4°C
overnight, and then the membranes were washed with
TBST and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Santa Cruz # sc-2030) for 1.5 hours and
finally washed and visualized using Chemiluminescent
ECL reagent (Beyotime # P0018).

Equal numbers of HepG2 cells stably expressing
either control or lincRNA-p21 knockdown, U6 or
lincRNA-p21 overexpression vectors (5 × 106) in 100 μl
of a 1:1 mixture of culture medium and growth factor–
reduced Matrigel were implanted subcutaneously into
the forelegs of 4- to 5-week-old male BALB/c athymic
nu/nu mice (Vital River). When the tumors reached
approximately 7–10 mm in diameter, they were prepared
to form a brei and then injected subcutaneously into nude
mice. Tumor growth was monitored by tumor weight at
the end of study (Four weeks for in vivo tumor growth).
The study was approved by the Animal Research Ethics
Committee of Second Military Medical University.
The methods were carried out in accordance with the
approved guidelines.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis of liver cancer cells was evaluated
with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assay.
FACS analysis was conducted with an Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (Abcam # ab14086) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. A FACS Calibur flow
cytometer was used for data analysis.

Western blot
Cells or fresh tissues were lysed in RIPA lysis
buffer with mixture of protease inhibitors (Beyotime
#ST506) and PhosSTOP (Roche #04906845001).

ROS determination

groups, one-way or two-way ANOVA analysis were
applied. The correlation of lincRNA-p21 levels with
patients’ clinicopathological variables was analyzed by the
χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate overall and disease-free survival.
Survival differences according to lincRNA-p21 expression
were analyzed by the log-rank test. Linear regression
analysis was performed to analyze the relation between
lincRNA-p21 level and AFP serum level as well as ER
stress markers in patients with HCC. P values of less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Dihydroethidium (DHE, Invitrogen #D11347) was
used for detecting ROS generation in cardiomyocytes as
per the manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistics
Values were expressed as Mean ± SEM. Statistical
differences between two groups were determined using
unpaired or paired Student’s t test. For more than two
