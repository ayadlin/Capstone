ABSTRACT:
Pharmacogenetic studies in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) typically use a
candidate gene approach. In an alternative strategy, we analyzed the impact of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug transporter genes on the molecular response
to imatinib, using a DNA chip containing 857 SNPs covering 94 drug transporter genes.
Two cohorts of CML patients treated with imatinib were evaluated: an exploratory
cohort including 105 patients treated at 400 mg/d and a validation cohort including
patients sampled from the 400 mg/d and 600 mg/d arms of the prospective SPIRIT
trial (n=239). Twelve SNPs discriminating patients according to cumulative incidence
of major molecular response (CI-MMR) were identified within the exploratory cohort.
Three of them, all located within the ABCG2 gene, were validated in patients included
in the 400 mg/d arm of the SPIRIT trial. We identified an ABCG2 haplotype (define
as G-G, rs12505410 and rs2725252) as associated with significantly higher CI-MMR
in patients treated at 400 mg/d. Interestingly, we found that patients carrying this
ABCG2 “favorable” haplotype in the 400 mg arm reached similar CI-MMR rates that
patients randomized in the imatinib 600 mg/d arm. Our results suggest that response
to imatinib may be influenced by constitutive haplotypes in drug transporter genes.
Lower response rates associated with “non- favorable” ABCG2 haplotypes may be
overcome by increasing the imatinib daily dose up to 600 mg/d.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Imatinib (Glivec®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation), along with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), has revolutionized treatment of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML). Long-term follow-up of
the IRIS pivotal study revealed that overall survival for
patients who received imatinib as initial therapy was as
high as 88% at 6 years [1]. Two second generation TKIs,
dasatinib (Sprycel®, Bristol-Myers Squib) and nilotinib
(Tasigna®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation) are
now registered as frontline therapy for chronic phase
CML (CP-CML) patients. Recent studies reported faster
and deeper responses assessed by cytogenetic or molecular
analysis with these drugs [2-3], however data are yet too
preliminary to determine whether these agents will offer
a survival advantage over imatinib. Comorbidities, age,
and co-medications tend to drive the choice of the TKI
in first-line therapy. Emerging reports of adverse events
with nilotinib (peripheral arterial occlusive disease) [4]
and dasatinib (pulmonary hypertension) [5] along with
the upcoming arrival of generic imatinib will move TKI
therapy towards a personalized approach. Disease-related
factors such as initial Sokal score have been shown to
influence molecular responses [6-9], however, few patientrelated parameters such as adherence to therapy or trough
imatinib levels have been evaluated [10-12].
Association studies have suggested that single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be related to a
susceptibility to develop CML [13-16], CML progression
[17-18] or intracellular accumulation of imatinib in
leukocytes of CML patients [19]. Only a limited number
of selected SNPs have been tested in relation to imatinib
response[20-28], and results obtained with the most
extensively studied gene ABCG1 (MDR1) are not
consistent across published analyses[29-30]. Complete
cytogenetic response (CCR) at 12 months remains the
best surrogate marker for survival in CML patients.
However, major molecular response (MMR, defined by
BCR-ABL≤0.1%) was used as a primary end point of
clinical trial (such as in the ENEST 1st study) [31] and
MMR at 18 months is also part of the “optimal response”
definition of the ELN2009 recommendation for CML
patient management [32]. We thus selected cumulative
incidence of major molecular response (CI-MMR) as a
criteria to identify SNPs in drug transporter genes which
are associated with a favorable outcome. We performed
an association study using a custom-made DNA chip in
an exploratory cohort. An ABCG2 haplotype associated
with high CI-MMR was identified. We then validated this
haplotype in an independent “prospective-retrospective”
cohort[33], and evaluated its impact according to imatinib
daily dose.

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Median age, sex ratio and Sokal score distribution were
comparable between all cohorts (P > 0.05 in all cases).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Determinants of CI-MMR
CI-MMR were estimated according to Sokal score
(n = 312). Using the Fine and Gray model we confirmed
that CI-MMR was strongly related to Sokal score levels
(regression coefficient: 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.53 to 0.78, P < 0.001). Figure 1A illustrates the inverse
relationship between Sokal score and CI-MMR.
CI-MMR was estimated in the SLEC (n = 105),
SVC (n = 239), and in the two imatinib SVC treatment
arms (n = 132 at 400 mg/d; n =107 at 600 mg/d; Figure
1B). CI-MMR was comparable between the SLEC and
the SVC 400 mg/d arm (P = 0.700), but was significantly
higher in the SVC 600 mg/d arm (P = 0.003). The
regression coefficient increased by more than 50% (1.53,
95% CI, 1.09 to 2.14) when the dose increased from 400
mg/d to 600 mg/d (P = 0.014).

SNP association study
Of the 857 selected SNPs, 413 (48.2%) from 86 drug
transporters were well genotyped in all evaluated patients
and passed quality control criteria. We identified 12 SNPs
(located in eight transporter genes) in the SLEC group
which were significantly associated with CI-MMR at 18
months on the basis of an FDR < 50% (Table 2). Only
one of these SNPs (rs12505410), located in the ABCG2
gene, was significantly associated with CI-MMR in the
overall SVC cohort. Separate analysis of the two SVC
cohorts revealed three SNPs (rs12505410, rs13120400
and rs2725252), all from the ABCG2 gene, which were
significantly associated with response in the 400 mg/d arm
while none were associated in the 600 mg/d arm. CI-MMR
at 18 months in the two SVC groups for the three validated
ABCG2 SNPs is shown in Supplementary Figure SF1.

Haplotype frequency
As expected, pairwise linkage disequilibrium was
found between the three SNPs at the ABCG2 locus in the
SLEC. We therefore performed haplotyping at this locus.
Estimated frequencies was 22% for haplotype 1 (G-C-G)
having G, C and G bases at loci rs12505410, rs13120400
and rs2725252, respectively, < 1% for haplotype 2
(G-C-T), 5% for haplotype 3 (G-T-G), 15% for haplotype
4 (T-T-G), 57% for haplotype 5 (T-T-T) and 2% for
haplotype 6 (G-T-T) (Supplementary Table ST2).
Haplotype frequencies at the same loci were also

higher CI-MMR rates. These two haplotypes share the
same alleles at rs12505410 and rs2725252 and differ at

the G-G haplotype at these two SNPs; carriers of the G-G

Figure 1: Cumulative incidence of MMR (CI-MMR) according to Sokal score and treatment arms. A) 18 months CIMMR was estimated with respect to Sokal score (n = 312). A Fine and Gray model showed that time to MMR was related to Sokal status
and that the coefficient of regression within the first 18 months decreased by 36% (95% confidence interval (CI), 47% to 22%) on average
when Sokal increased (P < 0.001). CI-MMR was 70% for the low Sokal score, 57% for the intermediate Sokal score and 39% for high Sokal
score. B) CI-MMR was estimated in the exploratory cohort (SLEC) and compared to both treatment arms of the validation cohort (SVC).
CI-MMR was comparable between the SLEC and the 400 mg/d arm of SVC (n = 237, P = 0.700), but significantly different between the
SLEC and the 600 mg/d arm of SVC (n = 212, P = 0.003). HR was 1.71% (95% CI, 1.20% to 2.44%) in the latter (n = 212, P = 0.003).
CI-MMR was 49% for the exploratory cohort, 49% and 67% for the 400 and the 600 mg/d arm of the SVC, respectively.

using a custom-made DNA chip [34] mainly containing
tag SNPs. The exploratory SLEC cohort reflected reallife practice with patients treated at imatinib 400 mg/d,
while the validation SVC cohort was composed of patients
included in the SPIRIT clinical trial and randomized to
imatinib 400 mg/d or imatinib 600 mg/d. We used the first
cohort to perform an association study with a large number
of drug transporter genes SNPs in CP-CML patients and
the second cohort in order to validate these results.
Studies evaluating SNPs in CML patients have
been performed on a small number of genes pre-selected
for their potential relationship to response [20-28].
However, the clinical significance of these results is far
from established, firstly because different genes were
analyzed by different groups and secondly when the
same gene was studied, the SNPs analyzed were not the
same. Accordingly, only two genes have been tested in
a validation cohort. One of them was confirmed (IFN-γ)
[25] whereas results for ABCG1 were not reproducible or
were contradictory [26-30].
Our approach confirmed known key data: the inverse
relationship between MMR rates and Sokal score and
significantly higher MMR rates at 12 and 18 months with
600 mg imatinib compared to 400 mg [35-36]. We have
extended these results with the identification of an ABCG2
haplotype associated with significantly higher CI-MMR in
two patient groups receiving 400 mg/d imatinib (i.e. a reallife and a clinical setting). Patients with at least one copy
of haplotype G-G (G at rs12505410 and G at rs2725252)
were good responders at 400 mg. This “favorable”
haplotype is widespread; about half of the population in
our study carries at least one copy. Interestingly, patients
in the validation cohort treated at 600 mg/d who did not
carry this haplotype showed similar CI-MMR levels as
haplotype carriers treated at 400 mg/d. Moreover, the
clinical pertinence of these results is supported by the
association of the G-G ABCG2 haplotype with the early

the SVC population was performed according to the
same assumptions as for the exploratory cohort and was
analyzed overall and by treatment arms (Figure 2 C, D, E
and F and Table 3).
In the overall SVC, 18-month CI-MMR increased
by 36% for patients with one copy of haplotype G-G (P
= 0.005, Figure 2C). In patients included in the imatinib
400 mg/d arm, 18-month CI-MMR increased by 64%
(P = 0.002, Figure 2D). Association of haplotype G-G
with CI-MMR in patients included in the imatinib 600
mg/d arm was not significant (P = 0.180, Figure 2E). CIMMR curves of patients with haplotype G-G included in
the imatinib 400 mg/d arm were comparable to those of
patients with other haplotypes in the imatinib 600 mg/d
arm (Figure 2F, P = 0.480). Of note, Sokal score remained
an independent determinant of CI-MMR in all populations
in a multivariate model (Table 3).
As expected from results of the Fine and Gray model
in the validation cohort, early molecular responses (BCRABLIS at 3 months ≤ 10%) as well as responses of interest
(BCR-ABLIS at 12 months ≤ 1%, BCR-ABLIS at 18 months
≤ 0.1%) were associated with the ABCG2 G-G haplotype
in patients treated with imatinib 400 mg/d (Table 4).
Using the CEU population genotypes, we tested
associations between haplotype G-G and 1772 SNPs
near or within the ABCG2 gene (including rs2231135,
rs2231137 and rs2231142). We identified 240 SNPs
with alleles in linkage disequilibrium with the haplotype
G-G. Interestingly rs2231135, located in the 5’UTR and
potentially linked to ABCG2 differential expression, was
significantly linked to haplotype G-G (P = 0.043).

at 12 and 18 months.
The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2
(BCRP, MXR or ABCP) is highly expressed in the
gastrointestinal tract and liver, and is involved in
absorption, distribution and excretion of a wide variety of
clinically relevant drugs, among them imatinib [37-38].
Germline polymorphisms in the ABCG2 gene have been
described as affecting expression, cellular localization
and/or substrate recognition of the encoded protein. More
than 24 sequence variations have been reported. The most
studied C421A (rs2231142) nucleotide change, results
in a glutamine-to-lysine substitution in the translated

protein (pQ141K). Among the studies of SNPs in the
ABCG2 gene, two included CML patients treated with
imatinib [20, 26]. The first showed that the homozygous
GG genotype of rs2231137 in ABCG2 in advanced stage
CML patients was significantly associated with poor major
or complete cytogenetic response[26], although this result
was not subsequently validated in an independent cohort
20.
We were able to test the association between
ABCG2 haplotype G-G and 1772 other ABCG2related SNPs including rs2231137 and rs2231142 (not
represented in our DNA chip) by means of an open-access
database. We found that rs2231135, which is a 5’UTR

relationship and eventual changes in ABCG2 expression
linked to these polymorphisms will have to be addressed
in further studies.
The SNP rs609468 from SLC22A1 (also known
as OCTN1 or HOCT1 and involved in imatinib uptake)
had the lowest p-value in our exploratory cohort (SLEC).
SLC22A1 has previously been studied in relation to
imatinib response. The SNP rs683369 and advanced
disease stage correlated with a high rate of loss of
cytogenetic response or treatment failure to imatinib [26],
whereas a polymorphism in rs1050152 was significantly
associated with MMR [20]. SLC22A1 activity was
found predictive of MMR and correlated with overall
and event-free survival, especially in patients receiving
less than 600 mg/d of imatinib daily [39]. Although the
hypothesis that changes in SLC22A1 sequence may result
in changes of activity affecting imatinib bioavailability
is particularly attractive, more recent studies have failed
to demonstrate association between SLC22A1 SNPs
and imatinib response [27, 40]. In the same way, SNP
rs609468 identified in the SLEC, was not validated in the
SVC in our study.
Finally, only 3 SNPs out of 12 were validated. This
result is in accordance with the FDR level selected in our
analysis. Interestingly no SNPs from our chip located
in the ABCG1 gene were found to be associated with
imatinib response in our analysis.
Pharmacological studies have suggested that
imatinib trough levels may mediate molecular response
[10, 12], and it is thus of interest to identify if this is the
case for the observed effect of ABCG2 haplotype on
molecular response (as is the dose effect). This question
will be addressed in patients included in the OPTIMimatinib clinical trial, an ongoing prospective clinical trial
evaluating imatinib dose adjustment driven by imatinib
trough levels (OPTIM-Imatinib, EudraCT number 2010www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, our results demonstrate the influence
of a constitutive ABCG2 haplotype on the response to
imatinib in CP-CML patients and raise the possibility of
personalizing imatinib daily doses in this population on
the basis of constitutive genotyping.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design
This study was approved by the Human Ethics
Committee of the St Louis Hospital, Paris. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to
study participation.
Analyses were performed in two independent
patient cohorts; the Saint Louis exploratory cohort (SLEC)
treated at the Saint Louis hospital specialized clinical trial
center (CIC), and the SPIRIT validation cohort (SVC)
treated at participating centers in the SPIRIT trial [36]
(clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00219739). Data were collected
at participating institutions, analyzed using the sponsor’s
data management systems. Access to primary clinical data
was available to all authors.

Patients and assessments
The SLEC included 105 consecutively referred CPCML patients enrolled at the CIC between 2006 and 2009
and treated with imatinib 400 mg/d. The SVC included
239 CP-CML patients from the prospective SPIRIT trial
based on sample availability from patients recruited to the
imatinib arms; 132 patients were treated with 400 mg/d
and 107 with 600 mg/d. Patients receiving imatinib plus
pegylated interferon-alpha2b or imatinib plus cytarabine
were not analyzed.
Peripheral blood samples for DNA extraction
were collected at the time of recruitment. BCR-ABL

transcripts were quantified by RTQ-PCR every 3 months
in accordance with international recommendations, and
expressed according to the international scale (IS) as a
BCR-ABL/ABL standardized ratio (BCR-ABLIS) [41].
MMR was defined as a BCR-ABLIS ratio ≤0.1%).
Genotypes from 76 unrelated and unaffected
individuals obtained from the CEU population (Utah
residents with northern and western European ancestry)
from the CEPH (“Centre d’Etudes du Polymorphisme
Humain”) database were downloaded from the 1000
Genomes Project website [42].

the Fine and Gray regression model with multivariate and
univariate analyses. Adverse events, toxicities or deaths
not related to CML which led to loss of molecular followup were handled as competing events. An SNP association
analysis for CI-MMR at 18 months was also performed
using the Fine and Gray model. Markers with a false
discovery rate (FDR) < 50% in the SLEC population were
investigated in the validation cohort (overall, 400 mg/d
and 600 mg/d) using a significance cut-off of P = 0.05. The
Benjamini and Hochberg method was used for multiple
testing issues [45]. Haplotype frequencies were estimated
in the SLEC, SVC (overall, 400 mg/d and 600 mg/d)
and CEU populations using the classic EM algorithm on
unrelated individuals implemented in the Haplo.stats R
library [46-48]. Homogeneity in haplotypic distribution
between populations was tested. An association analysis
between haplotype or Sokal score with CI-MMR at
18-months was performed using a Fine and Gray model.
The association between early molecular response (BCRABLIS ≤ 10% at 3 months) and responses of interest
(BCR-ABLIS ≤ 1% at 12 months and BCR-ABLIS ≤ 0.1%
at 18 months) and ABCG2 haplotypes were tested using
the chi-squared test. Data were analyzed using R Project
for Statistical Computing software (R version 2.15.2) [49].

Oncotarget website.

SNP selection and genotyping
A dedicated DNA chip[34] designed in 2006 by the
French REPAC network (coordinated by Pierre LaurentPuig and Fabien Calvo, Supplementary Table ST1) was
used for patient genotyping. Among 16 561 SNPs on
the chip, 857 covering 94 drug transporter genes were
selected. Genotyping was performed by Integragen SA
using the Illumina GoldenGate assay. A list of variations
from the ABCG2 gene was downloaded from the 1000
Genomes Project website [34]. All 16 561 SNPs genotyped
in the 105 SLEC patients and the 239 SVC patients were
included in the quality control process. Individuals with
a call rate below 90%, SNPs with minor allele frequency
below 10%, and SNPs with a call rate below 90% were
excluded.

Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were compared between
cohorts using Chi-squared or Wilcoxon tests. Sample
size simulations show that for conventional type 1 and
2 error rates, in a population of about one hundred with
approximately 60% of patients expected to reach MMR
within the first 18 months and with a regression coefficient
of two between groups, SNPs differentiating more than
one-third of patients are required [44]. This result led us
to investigate those SNPs discriminating at least one third
of the patients in a recessive mode.
CI-MMR at 18 months was analyzed in the various
patient cohorts (SLEC/SVC, and by imatinib dose) using
