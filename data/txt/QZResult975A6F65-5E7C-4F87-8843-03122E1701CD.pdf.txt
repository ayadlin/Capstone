Suppressing Pathways That Sense DNA Damage

Abstract
Melanomas resist conventional chemotherapeutics, in part, through intrinsic disrespect of apoptotic
checkpoint activation. In this study, using an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen, we identiﬁed
RhoJ and its effector PAK1, as key modulators of melanoma cell sensitivity to DNA damage. We ﬁnd that RhoJ
activates PAK1 in response to drug-induced DNA damage, which then uncouples ATR from its downstream
effectors, ultimately resulting in a blunted DNA damage response (DDR). In addition, ATR suppression leads
to the decreased phosphorylation of ATF2 and consequent increased expression of the melanocyte survival
gene Sox10 resulting in a higher DDR threshold required to engage melanoma cell death. In the setting of
normal melanocyte behavior, this regulatory relationship may facilitate appropriate epidermal melanization
in response to UV-induced DNA damage. However, pathologic pathway activation during oncogenic
transformation produces a tumor that is intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy and has the propensity
to accumulate additional mutations. These ﬁndings identify DNA damage agents and pharmacologic
inhibitors of RhoJ/PAK1 as novel synergistic agents that can be used to treat melanomas that are resistant
to conventional chemotherapies. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5516–28. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma, an aggressive and fatal malignancy resistant to
current therapies, has increased in incidence and mortality
over the last several decades (1). The DNA alkylating agents
dacarbazine or temozolomide are still used to treat metastatic
melanoma, but only 16% of patients respond with no improvement in overall survival (2). Melanomas are resistant to a
spectrum of chemotherapies including cisplatin, paclitaxel,
docetaxel, combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and
even newly developed BRAF inhibitors (3, 4). Melanoma cells
acquire the ability to invade adjacent tissues and resist chemotherapy early during their evolution (4), further underscoring the importance of developing more effective treatments for
this tumor.
Melanoma cells upregulate multiple pathways that allow
them to be intrinsically resistant to apoptosis (4)—this
includes the activation of anti-apoptotic factors [inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (IAP) family, FLIP], the downregulation of
pro-apoptotic genes (APAF-1, BAD, BIM), and the activation of
prosurvival pathways (NF-kB, AKT). Despite the fact that only

10% to 20% of melanomas contain p53 mutations, most
melanoma tumors contain additional mechanisms to suppress
the function of p53, a central regulator of chemoresponsiveness (5). Transcriptional (6) and enzymatic regulators of
melanogenesis (7) also modulate melanoma chemoresponsiveness. While extensive studies have identiﬁed multiple
pathways that control melanoma chemoresistance, this information has not yet led to the development of more effective
regimens to treat melanoma.
Synthetic lethal functional genomics screening is an
emerging strategy to identify drug targets for the rational
design of synergistic agents with selective toxicity toward
cancer cells (8, 9). A gene and a drug have a synthetic lethal
relationship if mutation or depletion of that gene sensitizes
cells to sublethal concentrations of a drug (8, 9). Synthetic
lethal screening has been used to identify genes that regulate
lung cancer, cervical cancer, and breast cancer chemoresistance (9–11). In this study, we use a systems-level screening
approach to identify regulators of melanoma chemoresistance with the goal of discovering pathways that could be
the molecular targets of new synergistic chemotherapy
regimens. This screen identiﬁed RhoJ, a CDC42 homologue
that regulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis
(12), as a novel regulator of melanoma cell chemoresponsiveness. We ﬁnd that RhoJ activates PAK1 in response to
DNA damage, which then suppresses the ability of ATR to
activate its downstream effectors Chk1 and ATF2. ATR
suppression ultimately results in decreased DNA damage–
induced apoptosis and the increased expression of prosurvival genes. Taken together, these studies uncover a new
signaling pathway that coordinately regulates survival and
chemoresistance.

RhoJ Regulates Melanoma Chemoresistance

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
MNT-1 cells were a gift of M. Marks (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and were cultured as described (13).
C8161 melanoma cells were obtained from Frank Meyskens
(University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA). SK-Mel-28
melanoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. SK-Mel-28 and C8161 melanoma cells were
cultured in RPMI medium with 10% FBS. Darkly pigmented
normal human melanocytes were purchased from Cascade
Biologics and cultured as recommended by the manufacturer.
The genome-wide siRNA library used in these studies and the
transfection protocols were previously described (13). Dacarbazine and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma and IPA-3 was
purchased from Tocris Biosciences. Cell line veriﬁcation was
conducted by Powerplex genotyping before use.
Antibodies
The antibodies for cleaved PARP, b-actin, p-Ser345-Chk1,
Chk1, p-Ser20-p53, p73, phospho-Ser343-NBS1, NBS1, tubulin,
ATF2, PLK1, PAK1, and phospho-PAK1,3 (Ser199/204)/PAK2
(Ser192/197) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
RhoJ (monoclonal from Abnova and polyclonal from Sigma),
p53 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Sox10 (goat
polyclonal, Santa Cruz Inc.), phospho-Ser490/498-ATF2
(Thermo Scientiﬁc), and p-Thr68-Chk2 and claspin (Abcam)
were purchased as indicated.
High-throughput transfection protocol
High-throughput transfection was conducted as described
(13). MNT-1 melanoma cells in plates were incubated for 72
hours at 37 C/5% CO2, and light-activated dacarbazine (14)
was added to make a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. After an
additional 48 hours of drug incubation, a CellTiter-Glo Reagent
(CTG; Promega) was delivered to each well, and the luminescence values for each well were determined. All SMART-pooled
siRNAs used in this study were purchased from Dharmacon
Inc.
Clonogenicity assays
SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L
pooled siRNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
incubated in the presence and absence of 10 mmol/L cisplatin.
Seventy-two hours after cisplatin treatment, treated cells were
washed with PBS and incubated in fresh media for an additional 5 days to allow colony regrowth. Relative cell numbers
were quantiﬁed using a sulforhodamine B assay (Sigma).
Flow cytometry
For the cell-cycle analysis, melanoma cells were trypsinized
and washed with PBS and then were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol. Cells
were washed with PBS after ﬁxation and were stained in a
PBS solution containing 40 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI),
0.1 mg/mL RNaseA, 0.1% Triton-X 100. For the apoptosis
assays, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and stained
with Alexa Fluor 488-Annexin V/PI according to the manufacturer's protocol (V13245; Invitrogen). After 15-minute
staining, cells were subjected to ﬂow cytometric analysis

www.aacrjournals.org

(BD FACSCalibur), and the resulting data were analyzed using
FlowJo. We used cells that were not treated with cisplatin to
establish gating parameters. Cells in the early-stage apoptosis
were deﬁned as the PI-negative Annexin V–positive population, whereas late-stage apoptotic cells were deﬁned as the
PI-positive Annexin V–positive population.
IPA-3 cisplatin sensitization studies
SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells or melanocytes were plated on
96-well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating, cisplatin and
IPA-3 were added as indicated. Forty-eight hours after drug
treatment, a CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega) was used to quantify
the number of surviving cells. The relative percentage of
surviving cells in IPA-3–treated and vehicle-treated samples
was measured to calculate the synergy between IPA-3 and
cisplatin.

Results
Genome-wide siRNA screen to identify candidate genes
that modulate melanoma chemoresponsiveness
We used a previously described (9) Dharmacon siRNA
library of 84,508 siRNAs corresponding to 4 unique siRNA
duplexes, targeting each of the 21,127 unique human genes
arrayed in a one-gene/one-well format (4 siRNAs toward each
gene) on 96-well microtiter plates to identify genes that
selectively supported melanoma cell survival in the presence
of dacarbazine (DTIC). MNT-1 cells, a cell line with intermediate resistance to a previously used in vitro genotoxic stress
(light-activated dacarbazine; ref. 14), were transfected with 35
nmol/L target siRNA using published protocols (13) and
incubated in the presence and absence of an empirically
determined sublethal dose of dacarbazine (Fig. 1A). An
ATP-dependent luminescence cell viability assay (CellTiterGlo) was used to quantify the impact of each individual
siRNA or siRNA þ dacarbazine on cell viability. To identify
genes that selectively support cell survival in the presence of
dacarbazine, we calculated normalized luminescence values
from dacarbazine-treated and -untreated wells for each siRNA
and used these values to generate cell viability ratios (Supplementary Table S1). siRNAs with low viability ratios (lower cell
numbers in siRNA-transfected, dacarbazine-treated wells than
in siRNA-transfected, carrier-treated wells) correspond to
dacarbazine synthetic lethal genes. In addition to identifying
140 candidate genes that modulate melanoma chemoresponsiveness (Supplementary Fig. S1A, red dots), we identiﬁed an
even larger number of siRNAs that appeared to selectively
promote cell survival in the presence of dacarbazine (z-score >
4). Closer analysis of these high z-score siRNAs revealed that
they all potently induced cell death in the absence of dacarbazine (Supplementary Fig. S1B), whereas the addition of dacarbazine appeared to promote the survival of a fraction of the
siRNA-transfected cells. Interestingly, this set of genes was
enriched in kinases including BRAF (Supplementary Fig. S1C),
the target of new melanoma therapies (15). While BRAF siRNAs
potently inhibited ATP accumulation in MNT-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B, red bar), the addition of either dacarbazine or
cisplatin slightly inhibited the impact of BRAF depletion on
ATP accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Recent clinical

RhoJ Regulates Melanoma Chemoresistance

trials have shown that the combination of dacarbazine and
BRAF inhibitors offers no improvement in survival when
compared with patients treated with dacarbazine alone (16),
suggesting that DNA damage agents and kinase inhibitors are
not necessarily synergistic in the clinical setting. These ﬁndings
reinforce the importance of establishing a mechanistic rationale for combination chemotherapies before the initiation of
clinical trials.
Identiﬁcation of synthetic lethal genes that sensitize
melanoma cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
Dacarbazine induces the methylation of guanine bases,
resulting in base mispairings that are ultimately repaired by
the DNA mismatch repair system (17). A dacarbazine-based
synthetic lethal screening approach would be predicted to
identify candidate genes that control mismatch repair while
also identifying other candidate genes that suppress the cellular response to DNA damage. To identify the subset of
candidates that suppress the DNA damage response (DDR),
we next sought to identify siRNAs that sensitized melanoma
cells to both dacarbazine and cisplatin, an agent that induces
the formation of more bulky DNA adducts, which can be
repaired by several different DNA repair mechanisms (17).
Initial studies eliminated false-positives present in our candidate list (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and used a pool deconvolution approach to conﬁrm that the observed dacarbazine
sensitization phenotypes for our top 12 hits were not a result
of RNA interference off-target effects using well-established
criteria (Supplementary Fig. S2B; refs. 9, 13, 18). The top 12
siRNAs identiﬁed in the screen also modulated dacarbazine
resistance in another melanoma cell line (SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells; Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition, we validated
that the siRNAs used in the study effectively inhibited the
expression of their target genes (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Dose–response studies revealed that 7 of the 12 identiﬁed
siRNAs potently sensitize SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells to cisplatin at low doses (RND2, RhoJ, SMARCE1, PPP1R12C, BLM,
PMS2, and ARL4A; Fig. 1B). As predicted, 2 regulators of DNA
damage resistance identiﬁed in the screen were DNA repair
genes (PMS2 and BLM) known to repair damage induced by
cisplatin (Table 1; refs. 19, 20). Two other genes (SMARCE1 and
PPP1R12C) regulate essential processes that are required for
DNA replication: chromatin remodeling (21) and mitosis (22),
respectively. Three of the 7 validated genes were Ras superfamily GTPases (RhoJ, Arl4a, Rnd2), implicating a novel role for
Ras superfamily GTPases in the DDR. Colony formation assays
revealed that depletion of RhoJ, RND2, BLM, PPP1R12C, and

SMARCE1 had profound effects on the proliferation/survival of
cisplatin-treated SK-Mel-28 cells (Fig. 1B). Once we had identiﬁed the subset of candidate genes that potently regulate cell
proliferation/survival, we next measured the accumulation of
apoptosis markers (cleaved PARP) in siRNA-transfected, drugtreated cells to identify which of these siRNAs sensitize melanoma cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. While low-dose
cisplatin treatment induced baseline levels of PARP cleavage in
MNT-1 and SK-Mel-28 cells treated with control siRNAs (Fig.
1C), low-dose cisplatin induced signiﬁcantly more PARP cleavage in MNT-1 and SK-Mel-28 cells treated with RhoJ, RND2,
ARL4A, PMS2, and BLM siRNAs (Fig. 1C). Of interest, one of the
genes that sensitized cells to cisplatin in both cell lines was
ARL4A, an Arf-like GTPase that is genetically ampliﬁed in
melanoma (23). The gene that most potently sensitized cells
to cisplatin-induced death was RhoJ. Retrospective analysis of
previously published microarray datasets revealed that RhoJ is
overexpressed in metastatic melanoma (Supplementary
Table S2; ref. 24), implicating a role for RhoJ in modulating
chemoresponsiveness in human tumors. RhoJ siRNA efﬁciently
inhibited RhoJ expression at both the RNA and protein level
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Moreover, RhoJ depletion potently
sensitized MNT-1 cells (Fig. 1E) and SK-Mel-28 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) to cisplatin-induced apoptosis as
measured by the accumulation of Annexin V–positive cells. In
contrast, RhoJ overexpression enhanced melanoma chemoresistance (Fig. 1F), suppressed cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage
(Fig. 1G), and also inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig.
1H). Taken together, these results identify RhoJ as a suppressor
of DNA damage–induced apoptosis.
RhoJ regulates melanoma chemoresistance by
uncoupling ATR from Chk1
While published studies have revealed that Rho and CDC42
signaling pathways regulate melanoma invasion (25), these
GTPases were not known to regulate chemoresistance. To
determine how RhoJ regulates melanoma chemoresistance,
we sought to identify downstream pathways activated by RhoJ
and determined how these pathways modulate the DDR. RhoJ
is a CDC42 homologue, a class of GTPases that can bind and
activate group I Pak kinases that contain Pak autoinhibitory
domains (26). We used a group I Pak inhibitor (IPA-3) to
determine whether Pak inhibition sensitized melanoma cells
to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. IPA-3 and cisplatin acted synergistically to inhibit ATP accumulation in melanoma cells
(Fig. 2A). On the other hand, melanocytes were very sensitive to
low-dose IPA-3 (Fig. 2B), and addition of cisplatin only slightly

depletion sensitizes melanoma cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. MNT-1 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hours and incubated in the
presence and absence of 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 48 hours. Apoptotic cells were deﬁned as Annexin V–positive, whereas necrotic cells were deﬁned
as PI-positive Annexin V–negative population by ﬂow cytometry. F, overexpression of RhoJ promotes melanoma chemoresistance. The relative sensitivity of
vector-infected or RhoJ-overexpressing C8161 cells to 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 48 hours was measured using a CellTiter-Glo ATP accumulation assay.

enhanced the inhibitory effect of IPA-3 on ATP accumulation
(Fig. 2B). Next, we asked whether group I Pak kinases (PAK1,
PAK2, or PAK3) are activated by RhoJ. Using an antibody
that can recognize phospho-Ser199/204 PAK1/3 or Ser192/
197PAK2, we observed that cisplatin treatment induced the
accumulation of a band that corresponds to p-PAK1/3 in both
MNT-1 and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells (Fig. 2C). Cisplatin did
not induce the accumulation of a band that corresponds to
phospho-Pak2, which migrates at a different molecular weight,
indicating that cisplatin activates either PAK1/3. Using antibodies speciﬁc for PAK1 and PAK3, we show that Pak3
expression is undetectable in the cells studied (Supplementary
Fig. S4C), suggesting that cisplatin activates PAK1. Importantly, cisplatin induced the accumulation of phospho-PAK1 in a
RhoJ-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), whereas Pak1 depletion
sensitized both SK-Mel-28 and MNT-1 melanoma cells to
cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 2D). These results are
consistent with published studies that have shown that RhoJ

5520

Cancer Res; 72(21) November 1, 2012

can activate PAK1 (27) and indicate that RhoJ modulates
melanoma chemoresponsiveness by activating PAK1. If this
is true, then depletion of PAK1 in RhoJ-overexpressing cells
should sensitize these cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
While RhoJ overexpression induced the phosphorylation of
PAK1 and suppressed cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage (Fig.
2E), depletion of PAK1 in the context of RhoJ overexpression
inhibited phospho-PAK1 accumulation and restored the level
of PARP cleavage observed in vector-expressing cells (Fig. 2E),
consistent with the contention that PAK1 is activated by RhoJ
to deﬂect DNA damage–induced death. While we cannot
exclude that RhoJ can activate other group I Paks in other
melanoma cell lines when they are expressed, our results
indicate that RhoJ activates PAK1 to modulate melanoma
chemoresponsiveness in the cell lines studied.
Once we had identiﬁed a potential downstream mediator of
RhoJ signaling, we next sought to examine whether RhoJ/Pak1
modulates the DDR. Our initial screen revealed that RhoJ

Figure 2. RhoJ regulates the activation of group I Pak kinases. A, group I Pak inhibitors sensitize melanoma cells to cisplatin. SK-Mel-28 (SKM28) cells were
treated with 30 mmol/L cisplatin and the indicated dose of IPA-3 for 48 hours. The ratio of surviving cells in cisplatin þ IPA-3–treated wells was normalized to
wells treated with cisplatin alone. B, group I Pak inhibitors slightly sensitize melanocytes to cisplatin. Deeply pigmented human epidermal melanocytes
were treated with indicated doses of the PAK1 inhibitor IPA-3 in the presence or absence of 20 mmol/L cisplatin for 48 hours. The ratios of CellTiter-Glo values
were normalized to the value in vehicle-treated cells.  , P < 0.05 compared with IPA-3 alone in the same dose by the Student t test. C, RhoJ activates
PAK1/PAK3 in response to DNA damage. SKM28 and MNT-1 melanoma cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and incubated with or without
cisplatin for 24 hours. The accumulation of phosphorylated PAK1, PAK2, or PAK3 was determined. The accumulation of phosphorylated PAK2, which
migrates at a lower molecular weight than PAK1/PAK3, was not observed. D, Pak1 depletion sensitizes melanoma cells to cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage.
MNT-1 or SKM28 cells were transfected with PAK1 siRNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were incubated with the indicated doses of cisplatin for
20 hours. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. E, PAK1 depletion sensitizes RhoJ-overexpressing cells
to cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage. Vector or RhoJ-overexpressing C8161 melanoma cells were transfected with control or PAK1 siRNAs for 48 hours and
were incubated with 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours. The relative levels of cleaved PARP, p-Ser199-PAK1, PAK1, RhoJ, and actin were measured. Cis,

depletion sensitized cells to dacarbazine, an agent that generates DNA mismatches that are known to activate the ATR
kinase [ref. 28 (#10926)]. Once activated, ATR phosphorylates
multiple different targets, including H2AX and Chk1, which can
then mark the sites of stalled replication forks or induce cellcycle arrest/apoptosis, respectively (17). There is some inherent redundancy in this system, as ATM, a kinase that is induced
upon double-strand break formation, can also phosphorylate
H2AX when ATR is not active (29). Cisplatin induced similar
amounts of p-H2Ax accumulation in RhoJ-depleted or control
siRNA–treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). RhoJ depletion
itself did not induce DNA damage and cisplatin induced a
similar amount of DNA damage in RhoJ-depleted or control
siRNA–transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Taken
together, these observations indicate that RhoJ does not inhibit
DNA damage from occurring.
Once we had determined that RhoJ does not prevent DNA
damage, we sought to determine whether RhoJ/PAK1 modulates the cellular response to DNA damage. Upon DNA
damage, ATR localizes to chromatin where it is activated
(30). ATR then phosphorylates Chk1 on Ser345, which can
initiate cell-cycle arrest or induce apoptosis (30). RhoJ deple-

tion when coupled with cisplatin treatment induced the selective accumulation of Chk1 phosphorylated at its ATR-dependent sites (Fig. 3A), indicating that RhoJ modulates ATR
activity. Surprisingly, pChk2, a kinase that is phosphorylated
speciﬁcally by ATM (28), accumulates in untreated cells but
not in cisplatin-treated cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that RhoJ
modulates ATR and not ATM activity. PAK1 depletion or IPA-3
treatment when coupled with cisplatin treatment also induced
the accumulation of pChk1 (Fig. 3A), indicating that RhoJ/
PAK1 normally suppress Chk1 activation. Finally, RhoJ overexpression suppressed cisplatin-induced accumulation of pSer345-Chk1 (Fig. 3B), showing that RhoJ and Pak1 inhibits the
ability of ATR to phosphorylate Chk1 (30).
Once we had shown that RhoJ suppresses ATR activation, we
next asked whether RhoJ regulates cisplatin-induced apoptosis
in an ATR-dependent manner. While RhoJ depletion when
coupled with cisplatin induced the accumulation of cleaved
PARP, co-depletion of ATR and RhoJ suppressed cisplatininduced cleaved PARP accumulation in both p53 wild-type
(C8161) and p53-mutant (SK-Mel-28) cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly,
depletion of RhoJ or ATR alone when coupled with cisplatin
treatment induced the accumulation of Annexin V–positive

Figure 4. RhoJ inhibits drug-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. A, RhoJ depletion synergizes with chemotherapy to inhibit proliferation. SK-MEL-28
(SKM28) cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L siRNAs and incubated with 1 mmol/L cisplatin or vehicle for 48 hours. EdU incorporation was
quantiﬁed. Representative images are contained in Supplementary Fig. S4D. B, RhoJ depletion synergizes with cisplatin to induce S-phase arrest. C8161
melanoma cells expressing control or RhoJ shRNAs were incubated in the presence and absence of 15 mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours and subjected to
ﬂuorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis as described. Note the accumulation of cells in the peak between G1 (200) and G2 (400). C, RhoJ/Pak1 modulates
cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in p53 wild-type cells. MNT-1 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and incubated with 30 mmol/L
cisplatin for 24 hours. The accumulation of p-Ser20-p53 (Chk1-dependent phosphorylation site) and p53 was measured. D, RhoJ/Pak1 does not modulate
cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in p53-mutant cells. SKM28 cells expressing the indicated shRNA (left) or transfected with the indicated siRNAs
(right) were incubated with the indicated doses of cisplatin for 24 hours. As p-Ser20-p53 could not be detected in these cells (data not shown), the
accumulation of p53 was measured. E, p53 depletion mitigates the effects of RhoJ depletion on cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage in p53 wild-type cells. p53
wild-type (C8161, MNT-1) and p53-mutant (SK-MEL-28) melanoma cells were incubated with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hours followed by 30 mmol/L
cisplatin for 24 hours. Relative accumulation of cleaved PARP was measured. F, p53 depletion partially mitigates the effects of RhoJ depletion on cisplatininduced apoptosis. MNT-1 melanoma cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hours. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 30 mmol/L
cisplatin for 48 hours. Apoptosis was quantiﬁed by measuring the intensity of Annexin V staining. Cis, cisplatin; CTL, control; Vec, vector.

cells (Fig. 3D, top), whereas co-depletion of ATR and RhoJ
suppressed the cisplatin-induced accumulation of Annexin V–
positive cells (Fig. 3D, bottom). Depletion of Chk1 alone was
highly toxic, so we were unable to test whether RhoJ modulates
chemoresistance in a Chk1-dependent manner (data not
shown). Nonetheless, our observations indicate that RhoJ
suppresses the DDR by an ATR-dependent mechanism.
Next, we sought to determine how RhoJ/Pak1 uncouples
ATR from Chk1. Claspin, a scaffold that couples ATR to its
downstream effector Chk1 (31), can be phosphorylated by the
PAK1 target PLK1 (32). Phosphorylated claspin is subsequently
degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (31). We
found that RhoJ overexpression suppressed claspin accumulation, whereas RhoJ depletion stimulated claspin accumula-

tion (Fig. 3E), suggesting that RhoJ modulates ATR signaling by
modulating claspin accumulation. Similarly, PAK1 depletion
modulated claspin accumulation both in the absence and in
the presence of cisplatin (Fig. 3F). RhoJ overexpression induced
the accumulation of Plk1, the kinase that phosphorylates
claspin and induces its degradation. PAK1 depletion suppressed the accumulation of Plk1 induced by RhoJ overexpression (Fig. 3G), consistent with a role for PAK1 in activating
PLK1. Taken together, our results indicate that RhoJ modulates
the DDR by suppressing the ability of ATR to phosphorylate its
downstream effectors, including Chk1.
Published studies have indicated that Chk1 primarily functions to induce cell-cycle arrest (33), although it can also
initiate apoptosis by phosphorylating p53 (34). Depletion of

RhoJ Regulates Melanoma Chemoresistance

RhoJ suppressed proliferation (Fig. 4A, representative images
in Supplementary Fig. S5D) and enhanced S-phase arrest (Fig.
4B) in the presence but not in the absence of cisplatin in both
p53 wild-type and mutant cells, indicating that RhoJ suppressed Chk1-dependent cell-cycle arrest. As Chk1 can also
induce apoptosis by activating p53, we next sought to determine whether RhoJ regulates cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a
p53-dependent manner. PAK1 and RhoJ depletion induced the
selective accumulation of p53 and p53 phosphorylated at Ser20
(a Chk1-dependent phosphorylation site; ref. 34) in p53 wildtype cells (Fig. 4C). In contrast, PAK1 or RhoJ depletion did not
induce the accumulation of p53 (Fig. 4D) or p-Ser20-p53 (data
not shown) in p53 mutant SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells. Codepletion of p53 and RhoJ suppressed cisplatin-induced PARP
cleavage (Fig. 4E) and cisplatin-induced Annexin V accumulation in p53 wild-type cells (Fig. 4F). While co-depletion of p53
and RhoJ suppressed cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage in p53mutant cells (SK-Mel-28; Fig. 4E), it did not inhibit Annexin V
accumulation in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Taken
together, these results suggest that RhoJ regulates cisplatininduced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in wild-type
cells. In p53-mutant cells, the ability of RhoJ to modulate
chemoresponsiveness is only partially dependent on p53,
consistent with published studies indicating that mutant
p53 can be partially functional (35).
Next, we sought to better understand how RhoJ regulates
melanoma chemoresponsiveness in p53-mutant cells. In
the absence of functional p53, Chk1 can modulate apoptosis
by phosphorylating the p53 homologue p73 (36). Unfortunately, co-depletion of p73 and RhoJ did not inhibit cisplatin-induced Annexin V accumulation (Supplementary Fig.
S3C). Still other studies have identiﬁed NBS1 as a protein
that is a downstream target of ATR (37) that can modulate
DNA damage–induced apoptosis (38). Co-depletion of NBS1
and RhoJ did suppress cisplatin-induced apoptosis in p53mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover, cisplatin
treatment induced the phosphorylation of NBS1 at its ATRspeciﬁc phosphorylation site only in RhoJ siRNA–treated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3D), indicating that RhoJ normally suppresses cisplatin-induced NBS1 phosphorylation.
Taken together, these results suggest that RhoJ regulates
melanoma chemoresistance by suppressing the ability of
ATR to phosphorylate its downstream effectors, resulting in
decreased activation of Chk1 and the decreased phosphor-

ylation of Chk1 targets including p53. In p53-mutant cells,
RhoJ can suppress cisplatin-induced apoptosis both by
inhibiting the activation of hypofunctional p53 and by
suppressing the ability of ATR to phosphorylate other effectors, such as NBS1. Interestingly, other targets identiﬁed in
our screen did not modulate Chk1 activation but did modulate p53 accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S5C), reinforcing the concept that p53 is a central regulator of melanoma
chemoresponsiveness.
RhoJ modulates melanoma chemoresistance by
modulating the expression of Sox10
To gain a better appreciation of molecular pathways
regulated by RhoJ, we next sought to identify RhoJ-regulated
genes and pathways using a microarray-based approach (see
dataset, Supplementary Table S3). Gene set enrichment
analysis (39) revealed that regulators of neural development
were signiﬁcantly up- or downregulated in cells expressing
RhoJ short hairpin RNA (shRNA) when compared with cells
expressing control shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In
particular, chronic RhoJ depletion potently inhibited the
expression of Sox10 (>100-fold) as well as Sox10 target genes
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). Chronic RhoJ depletion was sufﬁcient to inhibit both Sox10 mRNA/protein accumulation in
C8161 and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells (Fig. 5A). While RhoJ
depletion did not inhibit the accumulation of Sox10 mRNA
in melanocytes, it did inhibit the accumulation of Sox10
protein in these cells (Fig. 5A). RhoJ overexpression induced
the accumulation of Sox10 mRNA and protein in both SKMel-28 cells and normal melanocytes (Fig. 5B), indicating
that RhoJ regulates the expression of Sox10.
Sox10, a known oncogene in melanomas, regulates the
survival of neural crest precursor cells before lineage commitment in the developing embryo (40) and is a reliable marker for
melanoma tumor–initiating cells (41). Recent studies have
determined that Sox10 is required for melanoma formation
in both mice and humans and determined that depletion of
Sox10 alone is sufﬁcient to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells
(42). ATF2, a transcription factor that is activated by ATM/ATR
signaling, has recently been shown to suppress Sox10 expression in melanoma cells (43). Depletion of ATR inhibited
the phosphorylation of ATF2 at its ATR/ATM target sites
while also inducing the accumulation of Sox10 (Fig. 5C),
consistent with a role for ATR in modulating ATF2 function

time points. The relative amount of Sox10 protein was measured via immunoblotting. D, ATR modulates ATF2 phosphorylation. SKM28 and MNT-1 cells
were transfected with control or ATR siRNAs followed by incubation with 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours. The accumulation of p-Thr490/498-ATF2, a
downstream target of ATR, and Sox10 was measured by immunoblotting. E, RhoJ/Pak1 depletion or group I Pak inhibition modulates ATF2 phosphorylation.
SKM28 cells were either transfected with the indicated siRNAs followed by incubation with 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours or were incubated in the presence
or absence 30 mmol/L cisplatin combined with indicated doses of IPA-3 for 24 hours. The accumulation of p-Thr490/498-ATF2 and ATF2 was measured via
immunoblotting. F, Pak1 depletion or inhibition modulates Sox10 accumulation. SKM28 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs followed by
incubation with 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours or were incubated in the presence or absence of 30 mmol/L cisplatin and the indicated dose of IPA-3 for 24
hours. Relative accumulation of Sox10 and actin was measured by Western blotting. G, Sox10 depletion sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis. MNT-1 cells were treated with control or Sox10 siRNA and the indicated dose of cisplatin for 24 hours. Relative accumulation of cleaved PARP and
actin was measured via immunoblotting. H, Sox10-overexpressing melanoma cells are more resistant to cisplatin-induced cell death. SKM28 cells
overexpressing Sox10 or vector were treated with 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours before immunoblotting. I, Sox10 overexpression partially mitigates the
effect of Pak inhibitors on cisplatin-induced apoptosis. SKM28 cells overexpressing Sox10 or infected with virus encoding the empty vector were treated with
or without 3 mmol/L IPA-3 in the presence of 30 mmol/L cisplatin for 72 hours. Cell survival was quantiﬁed using a CellTiter-Glo assay.  , P  0.05; ##, P  0.01

and repressing Sox10 expression. In contrast, RhoJ or Pak1
depletion or Pak1 inhibition resulted in the accumulation of
ATF2 phosphorylated at its ATR target sites (Fig. 5D). PAK1
depletion or inhibition ultimately resulted in the decreased
accumulation of Sox10 (Fig. 5E). Sox10 depletion inhibited
melanoma cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S6C) and sensitized melanoma cells to cisplatin-induced PARP cleavage
(Fig. 5F). In addition, cisplatin treatment inhibited Sox10
accumulation (Fig. 5G), indicating that ATR activation can
suppress Sox10 expression. Intriguingly, Sox10 overexpression inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis in p53-mutant
cells (Fig. 5H), and Sox10 overexpression partially mitigated
the impact of Pak inhibitors on cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 5I).
These results indicate that Sox10 expression also promotes
melanoma chemoresistance. In summary, our results indicate that RhoJ activates PAK1 in response to DNA damage.
Activated Pak1 then suppresses claspin accumulation, which
uncouples ATR from its downstream effectors Chk1 and
ATF2. This ultimately results in the functional inactivation
of p53 and the increased expression of prosurvival genes

In this study, we have used an unbiased genome-wide
functional genomics approach to identify RhoJ and its downstream kinase PAK1 as novel regulators of response of the
melanoma cell to DNA damage. Cisplatin activates PAK1 in a
RhoJ-dependent fashion, indicating that RhoJ activates PAK1
to modulate melanoma chemoresistance. While RhoJ does not
inhibit cisplatin-induced DNA damage, it does suppress the
phosphorylation of the ATR downstream effectors Chk1 and
ATF2. In p53 wild-type cells, RhoJ-induced ATR suppression
leads to a functional inactivation of p53. In p53-mutant cells,
RhoJ-induced ATR suppression results in the decreased phosphorylation of the ATR target NBS1 and the increased expression of Sox10, which can also suppress drug-induced apoptosis.
Importantly, parallel studies have determined that PAK1
depletion or Pak kinase inhibition recapitulated all of the
phenotypes observed upon RhoJ depletion, suggesting that
RhoJ regulates all of these phenotypes, in part, by activating
PAK1. Taken together, these studies identify the suppression of
DNA damage sensing, as opposed to the commonly accepted
mechanism of apoptosis execution, as a linchpin of chemoresistance in melanoma and nominate RhoJ and PAK1 as optimal
therapeutic targets for the rational design of novel synergistic
chemotherapy regimens.
Melanocytes in the epidermis produce melanin in response
to UVB irradiation and transfer this pigment to keratinocytes,
protecting them from UV-induced DNA damage (44). To
accomplish this, melanocytes must possess mechanisms to
resist DNA damage–induced apoptosis and also facilitate the
expression of genes that regulate melanin production and
survival (45). Of interest, our results suggest that RhoJ and
PAK1 limit the response to DNA damage while concomitantly
facilitating the expression of central regulators of melanogenesis. RhoJ/PAK1 suppress ATR activation, which can also be
induced by UV, allowing the melanocyte to tolerate higher
levels of DNA damage than other epidermal cells. ATR sup-

Figure 6. RhoJ/Pak1 regulate melanoma chemoresistance by
suppressing cellular mechanisms that sense DNA damage. Our studies
revealed that RhoJ/Pak kinases activate Plk1, resulting in the
phosphorylation and degradation of claspin. In the absence of claspin,
ATR is not able to activate its downstream effectors Chk1 and ATF2. In
p53 wild-type cells, Chk1 is no longer able to phosphorylate p53 and
induce apoptosis, whereas ATF2 is no longer able to regulate the
expression of Sox10, which also suppresses apoptosis and stimulates
cell proliferation.

pression in turn leads to the increased expression of Sox10,
which can in turn regulate MITF, a transcription factor that
controls the expression of multiple genes required for melanin
production (46). Elevated expression of Sox10 is observed in
melanoma tumors, and Sox10 is required for melanoma formation (42). Similarly, RhoJ is overexpressed in advanced
melanomas as compared with primary melanomas (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, melanoma tumors that occur in
UV-exposed skin are known to accumulate large numbers of
mutations (47), suggesting they have an increased DNA damage tolerance. These observations suggest that in the normal
setting, RhoJ/PAK1 activity allows melanocytes to tolerate
limited amounts of DNA damage to facilitate the production
of melanin in response to UV stress. When this pathway is
activated in melanoma, the resulting tumor cells are profoundly resistant to DNA damage agents and have an increased DNA
damage tolerance as evidenced by their accumulation of
multiple mutations. Taken in context, our results indicate that
melanoma cells are intrinsically chemoresistant because they
activate cell-autonomous, lineage-selective pathways that
blunt the responsiveness of the DNA damage surveillance
machinery, thus allowing them to persist in the face of high
levels of DNA damage. Development of agents that selectively
disable RhoJ/PAK1 pathway activity may therefore represent
an opportunity to resensitize melanoma tumors to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
