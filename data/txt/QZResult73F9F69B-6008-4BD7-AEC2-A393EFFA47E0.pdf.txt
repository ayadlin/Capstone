ABSTRACT:
Cdk9 is a key elongation factor for RNA transcription and functions by
phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Here we present
direct evidence that cdk9 is important for cancer cell survival and describe the
characterization of the potent cdk9 inhibitor CDKI-73 in primary human leukemia
cells. CDKI-73 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis that was preceded by
dephosphorylation of cdk9 and serine 2 of RNA polymerase II. CDKI-73 was more
potent than the pan-cdk inhibitor flavopiridol and showed >200-fold selectivity
against primary leukemia cells when compared with normal CD34+ cells. Furthermore,
CDKI-73 was equipotent in poor prognostic sub-groups of leukemia patients and
showed cytotoxic synergy with the nucleoside analog fludarabine. The Mechanism
of synergy was associated with CDKI-73-mediated transcriptional inhibition of MCL1
and XIAP that was maintained when used in combination with fludarabine. Our data
present a strong rationale for the development of cdk9 inhibitors such as CDKI-73
as anticancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins clearly
contributes to this process[3]. MCL1, a member of the
BCL2 family, is particularly associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis [7, 8] suggesting that
therapeutic strategies targeting this protein may be of
particular value in CLL. Given the short half-life of MCL1
[9], one strategy for targeting MCL1 is transient inhibition
of transcription.
Transcription initiation and elongation is regulated
by the cyclin dependent kinases (cdk7 and cdk9), which
phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of
RNA polymerase II[10]. Cdk9 and its cyclin partner,
cyclin T1, are highly expressed in CLL suggesting that
it may play a role in the pathology of this disease [11,
12]. Indeed, inhibition of these cdks by the cdk inhibitors
flavopiridol, SNS-032 and R-roscovitine results in rapid
depletion of MCL1 and the induction of apoptosis in
primary CLL cells [13-15]. Although these pan cdk

A number of human cancers, including chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), are associated with the
over expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins
[1-3]. CLL is the most common leukemia in the western
world and accounts for almost half of all leukemias in
older adults [4]. It is characterized by the progressive
accumulation of monoclonal CD5+ B-cells in lymphoid
tissues, bone marrow and peripheral blood and by the
resistance of neoplastic cells to apoptosis [5]. The most
challenging aspect of the management of CLL is the
treatment of relapsed patients [6] and given that most CLL
patients who require treatment will develop resistance
to conventional drugs, the identification of new CLL
therapies remains a high priority.
The molecular mechanisms that underpin drug
resistance in CLL cells are likely to be complex, but the

inhibitors showed great promise in pre-clinical models,
they have proven to have a narrow therapeutic window in
clinical trials, with complications relating to scheduling
and administration and significant side effect profiles [1618]. We therefore initiated a program of drug development
to identify cdk9 inhibitors with more favorable drug-like
properties and an improved therapeutic index.
Here we provide proof-of-concept that cdk9 plays a
key role in tumor cell survival as selective cdk9 inhibition,
using an shRNA strategy, triggered CLL cell apoptosis
confirming cdk9 as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic
target. We also describe the preclinical evaluation of the
potent cdk9 inhibitor, CDKI-73 in primary CLL cells and
detail its potential as a clinical agent both as a single agent
and in combination with the purine nucleoside analog
fludarabine.

biological evaluation of our lead compound CDKI-73
(Figure 2A) that was selected on the basis of its biological
potency and its excellent pharmacological properties. It
exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with oral
bioavailability of F = 56% following a single intravenous
bolus dose at 2 mg/kg and an oral dose at 10 mg/kg in
mice. All of the in vitro analyses were performed using
primary CLL cells and the pan-cdk inhibitor flavopiridol
was used as a comparator. CDKI-73 was cytotoxic
to all of the CLL samples tested (n = 38) with a mean
LD50 value of 0.08µM ± 0.10 µM following exposure
to drug for 48h. In contrast, normal B-lymphocytes (n =
10) and CD34+ normal bone marrow cells (n = 5) were
significantly less susceptible to the cytotoxic effects
of CDKI-73 (Figure 2B). The mechanism of CDKI73-induced cell killing was confirmed to be apoptosis
(Figure 2C) and this was mediated via a dose-dependent
induction in caspase-3 activation at an early time point
(8h) following exposure to CDKI-73 (Figure 2D). The
kinase inhibition profiles of CDKI-73 and flavopiridol
were very similar (Figure 2E) but the notional therapeutic
indices for the two agents were remarkably different with
CDKI-73 showing significantly enhanced selectivity for
CLL cells over normal B-lymphocytes and CD34+ bone
marrow cells. The apparent discrepancy in these results
may be explained, at least in part, by the recent finding
that flavopiridol is also a DNA damaging agent [20] and
that it induces ER stress and autophagy [22].

RESULTS
Cdk9 knockdown inhibits survival of MEC-1 cells
and primary CLL cells
As a first step, we set out to establish the biological
consequences of specifically inhibiting cdk9. We silenced
cdk9 expression using a lentiviral short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) construct in the immortalized CLL cell line,
MEC-1 [19] and in primary CLL cells freshly isolated
from patients. Cdk9 silencing was most effective in the
MEC-1 cell line (Figure 1A) and stable knockdown was
possible in these cells to 20 % of empty vector controls.
Furthermore, cdk9- MEC-1 cells showed significantly
increased sensitivity to fludarabine when compared to
empty vector and scrambled vector controls (Figure
1B). Despite the technical challenges associated with
genetic modification of primary CLL cells, short-term
knockdown of cdk9 was also achieved in primary CLL
cells to approximately 50% of empty vector controls
(Figure 1C) and this resulted in a significant increase in
spontaneous apoptosis (Figure 1D). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that cdk9 inhibition has a biological
consequence in CLL cells and confirm that cdk9 inhibition
is a valid anticancer therapeutic strategy.

We have recently reported the development
of a novel class of 5-substituted 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2(phenylamino)pyrimidines with cdk9 inhibitory activities
[20, 21]. These inhibitors specifically target the cdk9ATP gatekeeper residue Ph30 and ribose-binding pocket
and structure-activity relationship analysis revealed
the importance of the 5C-group of pyrimidine core for
cdk9 potency and selectivity [21]. Here, we report the

in parallel co-culture experiments in which primary CLL
cells were co-cultured with CD40L-expressing mouse
embryonic fibroblasts; conditions known to be highly
cytoprotective to CLL cells [23]. CDKI-73 retained
cytotoxicity under these conditions whereas the cytotoxic
effects of fludarabine were abrogated. Importantly, CDKI73 was equipotent in CLL cells derived from patients
who had suffered clinical relapse following standard

CDKI-73 inhibits the phosphorylation of serine
2 of RNA polymerase II and MCL1 protein
expression in CLL cells

(Figure 3B). In keeping with this finding, when we broke
the CLL cohort down into prognostic subsets, none of
the poor prognostic markers appeared to significantly
impact upon the ability of CDKI-73 to induce apoptosis
(Figure 3C). All of the data presented in this manuscript
were derived from culture conditions supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. However, given the unfavorable
human plasma binding characteristics of flavopiridol
[24], we compared the cytotoxic effects of CDKI-73 in
culture conditions supplemented with 10% autologous
human plasma. As expected, the addition of autologous
plasma to flavopiridol-treated cultures resulted in a
marked reduction in apoptosis (>2-fold) in all the samples
tested (n = 7). Although CDKI-73 also showed reduced
cytotoxicity under these conditions, the effects were much
less pronounced (Figure 3D) suggesting that this agent
might have superior bioavailability when compared to
flavopiridol.

We next investigated the molecular mechanisms
that underpin the cytotoxic effects of CDKI-73 in CLL
cells. Treatment of CLL cells with 0.1µM CDKI-73 for
4h inhibited the phosphorylation of cdk9 and ser2 of
RNA polymerase II (Figure 4A). Phosphorylation of ser2
of RNA polymerase II is essential for RNA polymerase
II-dependent transcription[25] and inhibition of this
process has been shown to preferentially deplete labile
proteins like MCL1. The importance of MCL1 protein
expression has been previously shown in CLL and MCL1
depletion is sufficient to induce CLL cell apoptosis[25].
Here we demonstrate that CDKI-73 induces a rapid loss
of MCL1 protein (Figures 4A-4C) and this is mediated
by significant inhibition at the level of gene transcription
(Figure 4D). However, this inhibition is not restricted
to MCL1 as similar reductions in XIAP and CCND2
were also observed following exposure to CDKI-73 for

samples derived from patients with relapsed disease (n = 7) and in three patient samples with a p53 deletion. (C) CDKI-73 was equipotent
in samples derived from prognostic subsets of CLL patients. (D) Given the plasma binding characteristics of flavopiridol, the effects of
CDKI-73 were determined in autologous plasma. Although CDKI-73 exhibited reduced potency when compared to cultures carried out in
fetal bovine serum (n = 6), it was still able to induce apoptosis in the presence of autologous plasma and was significantly more active than
flavopiridol. *P < 0.05, **P <0.0001.

show significantly lower levels of transcription of MCL1

interaction was achieved using a fixed molar ratio of
100:1 (fludarabine:CDKI-73) (Figure 5A). All of the
samples tested (n = 10) showed synergy, with a median
combination index of 0.71. Furthermore synergy was
observed over the range of concentrations of drug used
as shown in Figure 5B. In an attempt to understand
the underlying molecular mechanisms for the synergy
observed, we performed gene expression profiling of
CLL cells treated with 10 µM fludarabine, 0.1 µM CDKI73 and the combination of the two agents (100:1). Gene
expression changes were observed under all drug treatment
conditions when compared with untreated controls. Figure
5C shows the relative expression changes in genes known
to be susceptible to RNA polymerase II inhibition. CDKI73 as a single agent down regulated MCL1, XIAP and
CCND1 and CCND2. In contrast, fludarabine induced the
expression of MCL1 but this induction was reversed by the

maximum clinically achievable dose of fludarabine and
the relative potency of each agent. The most synergistic

tested. (B) Synergy was observed at all the concentrations of drug combination tested. (C) Gene expression profiling revealed a potential

retreatment with fludarabine. Importantly, the combination of CDKI-73 and fludarabine showed a marked repression of MCL1, BCL2,
XIAP and CCND1 and D2. We next tested the effect of the combination under pro-survival, CD40L-expressing co-culture conditions. (D)
These conditions are known to induce marked resistance to fludarabine but synergy was retained when used in combination with CDKI-73.

conditions. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.0001.

major factors.

CDKI-73. This compound has potent cdk9 inhibitory
activity and excellent pharmacological properties.
Intriguingly, it has a similar cdk inhibitory profile to
flavopiridol but manifests a remarkably different toxicity
profile in primary CLL cells when compared to normal
B-lymphocytes and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells;
CDKI-73 is more than 200 times more selective than
flavopiridol against CLL cells. We hypothesize that this
is caused, at least in part, by the off target DNA damaging
properties of flavopiridol that we recently reported[20].
At the molecular level, CDKI-73 inhibited the
phosphorylation of cdk9 and ser2 residue of RNA
polymerase II. This resulted in the inhibition of MCL1
protein expression which we confirmed using both
Western blotting and flow cytometric quantification.
This reduction in protein expression was mirrored by the
inhibition of MCL1 transcription and consistent with the
inhibition of RNA polymerase II, we demonstrated similar
reductions in the transcription of CCND2 and XIAP at the
same early time point.
In addition to the promising potency and selectivity
manifested by CDKI-73, we demonstrate here that it
retains efficacy in primary CLL samples derived from
poor prognostic subsets including those who had relapsed
following fludarabine-based regimens. Given that most
CLL patients respond to frontline therapy but later relapse
[32], there is a clear need for novel therapeutics that can be
used in this setting. It is worthy of note that p53 mutation/
deletion is more prevalent in relapsed patients [33] and
here we show that CDKI-73 has similar potency in this
context. Furthermore, CDKI-73 appears to have more
favorable plasma binding characteristics than flavopiridol.
Although replacement of FBS with autologous plasma
resulted in the reduction in potency of CDKI-73, it was
much less marked than that observed with flavopiridol.
Given that fludarabine-based regimens still dominate
the treatment of CLL [34-36], we assessed the effects of
combining fludarabine with CDKI-73. We were able to
demonstrate synergy between these two agents consistent
with their distinct mechanisms of action. Furthermore, this
was explored at the molecular level using gene expression
profiling. As we predicted, CDKI-73 inhibited MCL1,
BCL2, XIAP and CCND1 and CCND2. In contrast,
fludarabine appeared to induce the expression of MCL1
and XIAP offering a potential explanation for the in vitro
and in vivo drug resistance that often ensues following
exposure to fludarabine [23, 33]. The combination of
CDKI-73 with fludarabine reversed the fludarabinemediated increase in MCL1 and XIAP providing a
molecular rationale for the cytotoxic synergy observed.
Furthermore, synergy was retained between these two
agents even under pro-survival co-culture conditions.
Fludarabine is largely ineffective under these conditions
[23] (Figure 3A) indicating that CDKI-73 is capable of
reversing fludarabine resistance. At the molecular level
our data strongly suggest a role for MCL1-mediated

CDKI-73 remains synergistic with fludarabine
under pro-survival co-culture conditions
We have previously shown that co-culture of
primary CLL cells with CD40L-expressing mouse
embryonic fibroblasts completely abrogates the cytotoxic
effects of fludarabine [23]. We therefore set out to
determine whether the addition of CDKI-73 could reverse
the drug resistance to fludarabine observed under these
conditions. Although the combination index increased
(median = 0.92), 8/10 samples tested showed cytotoxic
synergy and the other two additive effects under these
pro-survival culture conditions (Figure 5D). Analysis
of the changes in transcription of MCL1 under these
conditions confirmed that co-culture significantly induced
MCL1 both in untreated CLL cells and cells exposed to
fludarabine. In contrast, CDKI-73 significantly inhibited
MCL1 transcription as a single agent and in combination
with fludarabine (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION
Cancer cells often appear to demonstrate oncogene
addiction for anti-apoptotic proteins in order to maintain
their survival advantage and resist apoptosis. One
such cancer is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
in which over expression of BCL2 family proteins is a
hallmark of the disease.[3] The expression of MCL1 is
particularly associated with inferior clinical outcomes in
this condition[7, 26-28]; a protein with a short half-life
at both the mRNA and protein levels [9]. Cdk9 is a key
regulator of RNA Polymerase II elongation and hence
is particularly critical to the maintenance of expression
of short-lived proteins [29]. Given the clear clinical
importance of MCL1 in CLL, we rationalized that targeted
inhibition of cdk9 might prove to be a useful therapeutic
strategy in CLL and other cancers in which MCL1 is over
expressed[30]. In the first instance, we tested our working
hypothesis by silencing cdk9 using an shRNA approach.
Our data provide the first direct evidence that specific cdk9
inhibition can alter the survival characteristics of both an
immortalized leukemia cell line and primary leukemia
cells derived from patients. This new information provides
a strong rationale for the development of small molecule
inhibitors targeting cdk9.
In order to develop cdk9 inhibitors, we designed
a series of substituted 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-2-(phenylamino)
pyrimidine derivatives with functional groups attached
to the 5C-pyrimidine or 4C-thiazol ring moiety [20, 21,
31]. These compounds target the cdk9-ATP gatekeeper
residue Ph30 and ribose-binding pocket thereby conferring
increased selectivity. In this paper we describe the
biological characterization of one of our lead compounds,

fludarabine resistance and so the ability of CDKI-73 to
deplete the expression of this protein would appear to be
key. Taken together, we provide compelling evidence that
targeting cdk9 in CLL represents a promising therapeutic
strategy both as a single agent and in combination with
fludarabine.

Flavopiridol and fludarabine were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Poole, UK).

METHODS

Bacterial glycerol stocks containing the lentiviral
plasmid vector pLKO.1-puro with shRNA inserts against
CDK9 (495) along with an empty vector (EV) and a
scrambled shRNA (SCR) controls were obtained from
Sigma Aldrich (Poole, UK). For lentiviral production,
293T cells were transfected with complexes comprising
1µg lentiviral shRNA plasmid (495, EV or SCR), 0.75
µg P8∆91 plasmid, and 0.5 µg pMD2G plasmid using the
Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Transfected 293T cells were incubated at
37oC for 48h before the resulting lentiviral particles were
harvested by centrifugation and concentrated using the
Clontech Lenti-X concentrator kit (Lonza, Wokingham,
UK). Concentrated virus was added to MEC-1 cells and
incubated for 48h. Lentivirus-transduced cells were then
selected by addition of puromycin (1 µg/ml) to the culture
for two weeks. Subsequently, the relative sensitivity to
fludarabine of EV, SCR and 495 transduced cells was
assessed by flow cytometry.

Cell isolation and culture
Peripheral blood samples from CLL patients (n
= 38), normal age-matched peripheral blood (n = 10)
and normal CD34+ bone marrow samples (n = 5) were
obtained in accordance with the ethical approval obtained
from South East Wales Research Ethics Committee
(02/4806). Mononuclear cells were separated using FicollHypaque (Sigma, Poole, UK) and autologous plasma
was collected for use in some experiments. CLL B-cells
and normal B-cells were purified by negative selection
using CD3 microbeads. CD34+ bone marrow cells were
purified by positive selection using CD34+ microbeads.
All purification proceedures were carried out on an
AutoMACS Pro separator (Miltenyi Biotec., Bisley, UK).
Subsequently, 1x106/ml cells were maintained in RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), penicillin (50U/ml), streptomycin (50µg/ml) and
recombinant human IL-4 (R and D Systems, Abingdon,
UK) (5ng/ml). Normal Mouse embryonic fibroblast
L-cells, either non-transfected (NTL) or L-cells expressing
CD40 ligand (CD40L)[37] were used where indicated as
feeder layers.

from CLL cells treated with 0.1µM CDKI-73, 10µM
fludarabine or the two drugs in combination for 4h. First
strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
from 5 µg total RNA using a T7-(dT)24 primer (Genset
Corp, San Diego, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed with
the Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA).
After second strand synthesis, the resulting cDNA was
subjected to an in vitro transcription reaction using a
Bioarray kit (Enzo Diagnostics, New York, NY, USA)
to generate biotinylated cRNA. This was subsequently
fragmented and hybridized to the Affymetrix U133 2.0
Gene Chips. After hybridization, each microarray was
washed, stained and scanned with an argon-ion confocal
laser, with excitation at 488 nm and detection at 570
nm. The data discussed in this publication have been
deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and
are accessible through GEO Series accession number
GSE48258 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.
cgi?acc=GSE48258).

Determination of synergy between cdk9 inhibitors
and fludarabine
CDKI-73 was combined with fludarabine at an
experimentally determined fixed molar ratio of 100:1
(fludarabine:CDKI-73). CLL cells were treated with both
cdk inhibitors and fludarabine alone and in combination
to determine whether there were synergistic interactions
between the two agents. Synergy was calculated according
to the Chou and Talalay median effect method[38].

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Untreated cells and cells treated with CDKI-73,
fludarabine or their combination (fludarabine: CDKI-73,
100:1) for 4h. 5x106 CLL cells were re-suspended in 1ml
Trizol reagent and RNA was extracted using chloroform
and isopropanol. RNA (1μg) was used in a 20μL reverse
transcription (RT) reaction[23]. SYBR Green technology
(Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK) was used to
quantify the amount of RNA present in each sample using
primer pairs for CCND2 (cyclin D2), MCL1, XIAP and
RPS14. All primers were purchased from Eurogentec Ltd
(Southampton, UK). The amount of mRNA was assessed
using real-time RT-PCR using the LightCycler System
(Roche Diagnostics). The amount of RPS14 mRNA was
quantified in all samples as an internal house-keeping
control, and the results of the real-time RT-PCR were
expressed as normalized target gene values (e.g. the ratio
between MCL1 and RPS14 transcripts calculated from
the crossing points of each gene). All experiments were
performed in duplicate. Total RNA was amplified using the
following primers:CCND2: 5′- tcattgagcacatccttcgcaagc-3′
(forward)
and
5′ggcaaacttgaagtcggtagcaca-3′
(reverse);MCL1: 5′-aaaagcaagtggcaagagga-3′ (forward)
and
5′-ttaatgaattcggcgggtaa-3′
(reverse);XIAP:
5′-tgggacatggatatactcagttaacaa-3′(forward)
and
5′-gttagccctcctccacagtgaa-3′
(reverse);RPS14:
5′-ggcagaccgagatgaactct-3′
(forward)
and
5′-ccaggtccaggggtcttggt-3′ (reverse).

Statistical Analysis
The significance of differences between
experimental conditions was determined using the
Student’s t-test for paired and unpaired observations.
All data was confirmed as Gaussian or a Gaussian
approximation using the omnibus K2 test. To assess the
interaction between agents, the median effect method was
employed using CalcuSyn software (CalcuSyn; Biosoft
International, Ferguson, MO). The combination index
was calculated for the two-drug combination using an
experimentally determined fixed concentration ratio.
Combination index values < 1.0 indicated a synergistic
interaction. Affymetrix gene expression data were
processed using MADRAS software (Developed by
Peter Giles, Cardiff University). P values < 0.05 were
considered significant.
