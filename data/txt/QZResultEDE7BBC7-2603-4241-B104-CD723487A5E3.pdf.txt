HSP90 Inhibitor 17-AAG Selectively Eradicates Lymphoma
Stem Cells

Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC; also called tumor-initiating cells) comprise tumor cell subpopulations that
preserve the properties of quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation of normal stem cells. In addition, CSCs
are therapeutically important because of their key contributions toward drug resistance. The hypoxiainducible transcription factor HIF1a is critical for CSC maintenance in mouse lymphoma. In this study, we
showed that low concentrations of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG eliminate lymphoma CSCs in vitro and in vivo
by disrupting the transcriptional function of HIF1a, a client protein of HSP90. 17-AAG preferentially induced
apoptosis and eliminated the colony formation capacity of mouse lymphoma CSCs and human acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) CSCs. However, low concentrations of 17-AAG failed to eliminate highly proliferative
lymphoma and AML cells (non-CSCs), in which the AKT-GSK3 signaling pathway is constitutively active. The
heat shock transcription factor HSF1 is highly expressed in non-CSCs, but it was weakly expressed in
lymphoma CSCs. However, siRNA-mediated attenuation of HSF1 abrogated the colony formation ability of
both lymphoma and AML CSCs. This study supports the use of 17-AAG as a CSC targeting agent and, in
addition, shows that HSF1 is an important target for elimination of both CSCs and non-CSCs in cancer.

Introduction
Molecular chaperone proteins function to ensure the proper
conformation of client proteins when cells experience stress or
damage (1). Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is the most studied
and well-known molecular chaperone that facilitates the maturation and stable conformation of several client proteins,
including transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1a
(HIF1a) and p53, serine/threonine kinases (AKT, Raf-1, and
Cdk4), receptor/non-receptor kinases (HER2, EGFR, Src family
kinases), and steroid hormone receptors (androgen and estrogen; refs. 2–10). Because many of these client proteins significantly contribute to tumor growth and survival, abrogation of
their function with a single inhibitor has been an attractive
prospect, making HSP90 an attractive molecular target for
drug discovery (11). One of the original and most studied

HSP90 inhibitors is a derivative of the geldanamycin antibiotic,
17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG; ref. 12).
Through reversible binding to the ATP pocket of HSP90,
17-AAG potently disrupts its function, and ultimately induces
tumor cell death.
Tumor stem cells from both glioma and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) have been shown to rely on the activity of
HIF1a or 2a, respectively, for their maintenance (13–15). In
particular, human AML CSCs are a rare population of CD34þ
CD38 cells, and are thought to be responsible for the
resistance of conventional therapies (13, 16, 17). Current
efforts for targeting CSCs have focused on disruption of selfrenewal (18). However, this approach may be hampered by
the quiescent nature of CSCs. Therefore, disrupting genes
that are required for both maintaining CSCs in a stem-like
state as well as self-renewal might provide a more effective
therapy. We have previously reported a strain of T-cell
receptor transgenic mice (TGB), which spontaneously developed lymphoma with 100% incidence, due to an insertional
mutation of the Emp2a gene (19). Using this mouse lymphoma model, we identiﬁed that a small subset of
cells expressing both c-Kit and Sca1 are lymphoma CSCs,
and represent HIF1a is a target for lymphoma CSC therapy
(14).
17-AAG has been shown to target both the bulk population of cells and CSCs present within glioma and AML (13–
15, 20). In this regard, we hypothesized that 17-AAG may be
more suitable for targeting both lymphoma CSCs and bulk
lymphoma cells simultaneously through the disruption of
multiple HSP90 client proteins. Unfortunately, acquired

resistance to 17-AAG has been observed in both glioblastoma and melanoma through reduced expression of NAD(P)H/
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), an enzyme responsible
for activation of 17-AAG. In addition, induction of stressresponse proteins, such as HSP27, and HSP70 by 17-AAG
plays a large role in resistant cancer cells (21, 22). This
induction relies on the transcription factor heat shock factor
1 (HSF1), which regulates expression of HSP70, HSP27, and
HSP90 (23–26). Thus, targeting HSF1 in order to abrogate 17AAG-induced heat shock response has been proposed as an
anticancer strategy (27). This concept is supported by
reports showing that HSF1 is required for the initiation of
both lymphoma and RAS oncogene–induced tumors (28, 29).
In our study, we showed that low concentrations of 17AAG preferentially eliminate the CSCs of both lymphoma
and AML, but leaves the differentiated cancer cells unaffected due to their high levels of HSF1 expression. Knockdown of HSF1 abrogates the colony formation ability of
lymphoma and AML CSCs through disrupting HSP90amediated HIF1a stability. In addition, this provides a new
anti-CSC strategy by targeting HSF1 to eliminate aggressive
malignancies.

Materials and Methods
Mice, cells, and reagents
TGB mice in the B10.BR background were maintained by
heterozygous breeding pairs. B10.BR mice were used as recipients in lymphoma cell inoculation, and severe combined
immunodeﬁciency (SCID) mice were used for human AML
maintenance. Both lines were purchased from the National
Cancer Institute. All mice were kept and used for the tumor
implantation and treatment according to the procedures
approved by the Unit of Laboratory Animal Facility (ULAM)
at University of Michigan.
TGB lymphoma cells were maintained in 1% methylcellulose medium (MethoCult GF, 03434, Stem Cell Technologies). For some in vitro experiments, TGB lymphoma cells
were transferred from 1% methylcellulose culture to an
expansion medium: RPMI1640 medium supplemented with
10% FBS, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor
cytokines (R&D Systems), 100 mmol/L non-essential amino
acids, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.
Human AML cells were derived from the enlarged spleen
tissue of SCID mice injected with aggressive AML CSCs
(AML-71) as described previously (14), and maintained in
SCID mice via transplantation. Short-term expansion and
colony formation assays of the AML CSCs were carried out
similarly as for our lymphoma cells, except for a substitution of human cytokines for murine cytokines. Clinical
subtypes and genetic characterization of AML cells by
examining the appearance of the malignant cells and by
using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities were authenticated by the University
of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center.
17-AAG was purchased from LC Laboratories, The sources of
rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the speciﬁc proteins are as
follows: HSF1 (4356), HSP90 (4874), HSP70 (4874), phosphor-

S21/S9 GSK3a/b (9331), phosphor-S473AKT (9271), and AKT
(9272) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Mouse antibodies
to GSK3a/b (0011-A; Santa Cruz) and b-actin (AC-15; SigmaAldrich) were used in the studies.
Isolation of lymphoma CSCs and Colony formation assay
The lymphoma CSCs (c-KitþSca1þ) are a rare population in
TGB lymphoma tissue and express the surface markers c-Kit
and Sca1. The CSCs were sorted out from primary spleen
lymphoma tissue of TGB mice by ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) technology, or isolated by auto-MACS microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) twice, after staining with antibodies to
c-Kit and Sca1 (both from Becton Dickinson Biosciences). For
the detection of some downstream proteins requiring larger
amounts of cells, the c-Kitþ fraction (c-KitþSca1þ subset
combined with c-Kitþ Sca1 subset) were used. For colony
formation assays, lymphoma cells were seeded in 1% methylcellulose medium containing these murine cytokines in a 12well plate. After 6 to 8 days of culture, colonies were counted,
pooled, and then replated for consecutive rounds. For tumor
inoculation and viral infection, the cultured lymphoma cells
were expanded in the RPMI1640 medium as described above,
24 hours before these experiments.
Lentiviral infection and plasmids
The lentiviruses for short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting
HSF1 (Sh-HSF1) and scrambled control Sh-RNA were generated in HEK293FT cells in accordance with the lentiviral
preparation protocol (Invitrogen). Lentiviruses were prepared
in a 150 mm falcon culture dish, and 50 mL of media was
collected and centrifuged at 550g for 10 minutes to remove cell
debris. Viral particles obtained after centrifugation at 12,857g
overnight were suspended with 2 mL of RPMI1640 medium
containing 10% FBS, then aliquoted and stored at 80 C.
Between 50 and 100 mL of concentrated virus per million cells
was mixed with 100 mL culture medium and used for spinoculation in a U-bottom tube in a mixture containing 9 mg/mL
polybrene. The spinoculation was carried out at 2,500 rpm, for
2 hours at 30 C. After spinoculation, the cell pellet was
suspended gently and completely with fresh culture medium,
seeded and cultured in 1% methylcellulose for another 5 to 7
days before use.
The sequence of Sh-HSF1 (5-GCTCATTCAGTTCCTGATC3) has been previously validated (30), and was cloned into a Shlentiviral vector as described previously (14). The Sh-HSF1
sequence is shared by mouse and human. The constructs of
hypoxia responsive element (HRE) or its mutant (HRE-Mt)
EGFP reporter speciﬁc for HIF1a were described previously
(14). The full-length coding region of Hsf1 cDNA was ampliﬁed
by real time-PCR using mouse bone marrow mRNA as template, and cloned into a pcDNA vector with Flag tag fused into
the C-terminus of Hsf1.
Western blot
In general, sorted CSCs or cultured lymphoma cells were
lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 40 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
dithiothreitol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail

(Sigma). Supernatants of the lysate were used for Western
blotting and resolved on a reducing and non-heated (95 C for 3
minutes) denaturing 10% SDS PAGE gel. Transfer membrane
was blotted with primary antibody overnight at 4 C with
shaking, and was linked with secondary antibody at room
temperature for 5 hours.
MTT assay
The expanded lymphoma cells were seeded in the
RPMI1640 culture medium at a cellular density of 2.5  105
cells/mL in a 24-well plate. Next, the cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of 17-AAG and cultured for 48
hours. At the end of the treatment, the MTT assay for cell
viability determination was conducted according to the
manufacture's protocol (Promega) and the plate was read
at 490 nm.
Real time-PCR
Total RNAs from FACS sorted lymphoma CSCs and nonCSCs (c-KitSca1) were extracted using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). After reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA,
RT-PCR using the converted cDNA as template was carried out
in triplicate using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. Following
primers were used: Hsf1, F-TTTGACCAGGGCCAGTTTG, RTTCGGAAGCCATACATGTTGAG; Hif1a,F-AGTCTAGAGATGCAGCAAGATCTC, R-TCATATCGAGGCTGTGTCGACTGA;
Hsp90a, F-TGTTGCGGTACTACACATCTGC, R-GTCCTTGGTCTCACCTGTGATA; Hsp90b, F-CAAACAAGGAGATTTTCCTCCG, R-GCTGTCCAACTTAGAAGGGTC; Glut1, F-TGTGCTGTGCTCATGACCATC, R-ACGAGGAGCACCGTGAAGAT;
b-actin, F-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG, R-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT. Fold differences was calculated using the
delta Ct method (31) with b-actin as a reference gene.
Apoptosis assay
The cultured lymphoma and AML cells, after treatment with
17-AAG for 24 hours, were stained with surface markers of
ﬂuorescence-conjugated c-Kit and Sca1 (CD34 and CD38 for
AML cells), and then Annexin-V for 15 minutes at room
temperature before addition of 5 mmol/L DAPI. The apoptosis
percentage of these CSCs and differentiated cells were then
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
In vivo treatment of lymphoma with 17-AAG
B10.BR mice were inoculated with 5  105 lymphoma cells
through intraperitoneal injection. Seven days after tumor
implantation, the mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected
with 17-AAG or vehicle [10% DMSO þ 40% Cremophor EL:
Ethanol (3:1; v/v) þ 50% PBS] every other day for 3 weeks. At
the cessation of treatment, mice were monitored up to 80
days after tumor cell injection. To determine the effects of
17-AAG on lymphoma initiation in vivo, secondary B10.BR
recipient mice were implanted by intraperitoneal injection
of 1  105 lymphoma cells from the spleens of ﬁrst round
mice that had been treated with 17-AAG or vehicle. These
mice were followed up until 160 days post tumor cell
injection to monitor differences in tumor initiation between
the mice.

Results
Distinct features of lymphoma CSCs and bulk lymphoma
cells (non-CSCs)
We have previously shown that AKT-GSK3-b-catenin signaling is constitutively activated in the TGB lymphoma cKitSca1 cells (non-CSCs), and that HIF1a plays a critical role
in the maintenance of the lymphoma c-KitþSca1þ cells (CSCs;
refs. 14, 19). These lymphoma CSCs can efﬁciently initiate
lymphoma when small numbers are injected into immunocompetent recipient mice. Following tumor initiation, the mice
ultimately succumb to the committed, highly proliferative
lymphoma cells, which rapidly grow into a tumor mass in the
spleen and metastasize into other organs, such as the liver and
lung, leading to death within 1 to 2 months post-inoculation
(14, 19). These ﬁndings prompted us to devise a drug therapy
that could effectively target both CSCs and non-CSCs, for the
treatment of advanced lymphoma in humans. Because the
CSCs and non-CSCs harbor constitutively active HIF1a and
AKT (2 client proteins of HSP90), respectively, we tested the
HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG for the simultaneous targeting of the 2
cell populations.
We ﬁrst examined the expression levels of chaperones and
the transcriptional factor HSF1 in the CSCs and non-CSCs.
Using a FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson), 2 subsets of
TGB lymphoma cells (c-KitþSca1þ, c-KitSca1) were sorted
from mouse spleen tissue enlarged with the TGB lymphoma
cells (Fig. 1A). As previously described (14), the sorted
c-KitþSca1þ cells initiated lymphoma with 50-fold lesser
number of cells than the sorted c-KitSca1subset (Fig.
1B). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the mRNA
levels of HIF1a and its target Glut1 were 4- and 8-fold higher,
respectively, in the c-KitþSca1þ cells than the c-KitSca1
cells. This conﬁrmed the hypothesis that the c-KitþSca1þ
subset still maintained the unique marker of active HIF1a.
The mRNA levels of chaperones HSP90a, HSP90b, and
HSP70, and HSF1 were approximately 1-fold higher in the
c-KitSca1 than in the c-KitþSca1þ cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with mRNA levels, protein levels of HSP70 were higher
in the c-KitSca1 cells. Strikingly, there were large differences in the protein levels of HSF1, HIF1a, and the activated
status of the AKT-GSK3 pathway between the 2 cell populations (Fig. 1D and E). HSF1 had more than 10-fold higher
expression in the c-KitSca1 population, compared with
the c-Kitþ population. Consistent with our previous results
(14, 19), stable HIF1a was exclusively expressed in the CSCs,
while active AKT (pS473AKT) and GSK3 (pS21/9GSK3a/b)
were present in higher amounts in the non-CSCs than CSCs.
These distinctive expression patterns for stable HIF1a and
the active AKT-GSK3 pathway supports our initial hypothesis for targeting CSCs and non-CSCs simultaneously with
17-AAG.
17-AAG selectively eliminates lymphoma CSCs over nonCSCs
We next examined the ability of 17-AAG to suppress TGB
lymphoma growth using the MTT cell viability assay. TGB
lymphoma viability was inhibited with 17-AAG, with an IC50

These substantial differences in the IC50 indicate a profound

Previous studies have shown that treatment with 17-AAG
results in programmed cell death via apoptosis (32). To determine whether 17-AAG induced apoptosis in the CSCs and bulk
tumor cells, we stained lymphoma cells with Annexin V, a
surface marker of apoptotic cells, after 17-AAG treatment. As

secondary colonies, indicating that 17-AAG eliminated the
self-renewal ability of the CSCs in vitro.
In order to observe whether 17-AAG interfered with
HIF1a's transcriptional activity, we constructed a lentiviral
reporter system that used HIF1a binding to speciﬁc hypoxia-inducible responsive elements (HRE) to control EGFP
reporter expression (14). Lymphoma cells were infected
with either this reporter, or with a reporter containing a
mutant HRE (HRE-Mt) sequences (as a negative control for
gating). Without treatment, 25.8% of HRE-EGFP positive
cells were present in the c-KitþSca1þ subset, whereas only
0.786% were in the c-KitSca1 subset (Fig. 3C). This is
consistent with the speciﬁc expression of stable HIF1a in
the CSCs. With treatment, 10 nmol/L 17-AAG reduced HREEGFP expression in the CSCs by 2-fold, but had little effect
on the HRE-EGFP expression in non-CSCs, showing that 17AAG speciﬁcally suppressed HIF1a activity in the CSCs. In
addition to the reduction of HIF1a transcriptional activity
induced by 17-AAG, the mRNA levels of HIF1a and its target
Glut1 were signiﬁcantly decreased in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3D), indicating that HIF1a and its target
transcription are controlled by HIF1a stability. These

shown in Fig. 3A, low doses of 17-AAG (10 and 25 nmol/L)
increased apoptosis of c-KitþSca1þ cells by 2- to 3-fold, as
compared with the untreated control. However, 17-AAG failed
to induce apoptosis of c-KitSca1 cells at these low
concentrations.
As CSCs are best deﬁned by their ability to self-renew and
initiate tumor growth rather than by their surface marker
expression, functional assays provide a more accurate
assessment of drug-mediated therapeutic effects (33). The
generation of spheroid colonies has been widely used as a
manner to assay the presence of CSCs (34–36). Formation of
these colonies is dependent on the residing stem cell population, and is reduced with each stage of differentiation. To
assess whether 17-AAG affected CSC self-renewal, we plated
lymphoma cells and treated them with increasing concentrations of 17-AAG. As a result, 10 nmol/L 17-AAG reduced
the colony formation unit (CFU) of CSCs by more than 50%
(Fig. 3B), consistent with the dose necessary for induction of
apoptosis. These colonies were then replated in the absence
of drug, to observe whether self-renewal was also disrupted.
Cells from colonies previously treated with 10 nmol/L 17AAG were dramatically reduced in their capacity to initiate

A hallmark of CSC function is their ability to serially reestablish tumors in recipient mice. This CSC trait reﬂects their
capacity for self-renewal in vivo, and provides a method for
detecting chemical agents that can disrupt this process. To
examine whether 17-AAG treatment impaired the self-renewal
ability of TGB lymphoma CSCs in vivo, 1  105 cells obtained
from either 40 mg/kg 17-AAG- or vehicle-treated spleens were i.
p. injected into 5 healthy secondary recipient B10.BR mice. All
of the mice injected with vehicle-treated spleen cells eventually
succumbed to lymphoma. In contrast, only 1 mouse that
received 17-AAG–treated spleen cells died over the course of
the study (Fig. 4E). These data show that 17-AAG effectively
impairs the self-renewal of the lymphoma CSCs in vivo.

results show that 17-AAG speciﬁcally eliminates the CSCs
through inhibition of the HSP90-mediated mRNA expression
and transcriptional activity of HIF1a at concentrations,
which fail to eliminate the more differentiated c-KitSca1
lymphoma cells.
17-AAG eradicates lymphoma initiation in vivo
To investigate whether HSP90 inhibition can reduce lymphoma initiation in vivo, we injected 5  105 TGB lymphoma
cells i.p. into recipient B10.BR mice. Seven days after injection, different doses of 17-AAG (5–40 mg/kg) or vehicle
control were given to mice every other day for 3 weeks.
Upon cessation of treatment, 4 mice from the 40 mg/kg 17AAG or control group were euthanized and their spleens
weighed for indication of lymphoma. Vehicle-treated mice
exhibited enlarged spleens enriched in lymphoma cells that
stained positive for Thy-1, a marker for T lymphoma cells
(Fig. 4A–C). In addition, the lymphoma cells had metastasized into liver and lung tissue, as typically seen with this
cancer (19). In contrast, spleens from mice that had received
17-AAG were dramatically smaller, with less inﬁltrating
lymphoma cells in the spleen, and a lower metastatic spread
into other organs, compared with the vehicle-treated control
(Fig. 4C). In addition, 17-AAG–treated mice survived for
signiﬁcantly longer compared with mice that had received
vehicle alone, showing the effectiveness of 17-AAG in suppressing the lymphoma in vivo (Fig. 4D).

Knockdown of HSF1 abrogates the colony formation
capacity of lymphoma CSCs
To understand the mechanism underlying 17-AAG resistance in the non-CSCs, we investigated the effect of silencing
HSF1 on the growth of CSCs and non-CSCs, as HSF1 was more
highly expressed in the differentiated population. When we
treated the lymphoma cells with 50 nmol/L 17-AAG, a dose
capable of killing nearly all of the CSCs, we found that the bulk
differentiated cells were largely unaffected, as protein levels of
pS473AKT, pS21GSK3a, and pS9GSK3b remained unchanged
(Fig. 5A). Coinciding with reports in the literature, we also
observed an increase in HSP70 in reaction to HSP90 inhibition
with 100 nmol/L 17-AAG. However, 100 nmol/L 17-AAG could

Figure 5. HSF1 is required for the maintenance of lymphoma CSCs. A, lymphoma non-CSC cells resisted low doses of 17-AAG treatment. After treatment with
25 to 100 nmol/L 17-AAG for 24 hours, the cultured lymphoma cells were lysed for Western blotting to detect the expression of chaperones, HSF1, and the
AKT-GSK3 pathway. B, knockdown efﬁciency of HSF1 by shRNA. Twenty-four hours after cotransfection with the plasmids for Sh-HSF1, Flag-tagged
HSF1, or with other combined plasmids as indicated, the HEK293 cells were lysed for Western blotting to detect the HSF1-silencing efﬁciency using
anti-Flag antibody. Lef1, lymphocyte enhancer factor 1. C–E, knockdown of HSF1 abrogated the colony formation ability of lymphoma CSCs. C, after infection
with the lentivirus for Sh-HSF1 or scrambled control, a portion of infected cells was cultured in expanded medium for 48 hours to check the infection efﬁciency.
D, relative mRNA levels of HSF1 and HSP90a to scrambled control (Sr), which was arbitrarily set as 1, were determined in sorted EGFP-positive cells
expressing Sh-HSF1 or Sh-Sr. E, the remaining portion of infected cells post infection was directly seeded in triplicate in 1% methylcellulose medium for
CFUs assays. EGFP-positive colonies were counted under ﬂuorescence microscope after 7 days of culture. All data presented here have been repeated at
least twice.

reduce the levels of these phosphorylated proteins in addition
to reducing HSP90 and HSF1. This dramatic loss in cell viability
was, in part, due to drug toxicity, as all of our controls (AKT,
GSK3a, GSK3b, and b-actin) were sharply decreased and cell
death was observed. This result indicates that 17-AAG does not
affect HSP90-mediated AKT activation if HSF1 protein levels
are very high, because high levels of HSF1 could maintain or
further increase the transcription of HSP90 or HSP70 to
compensate for HSP90 inhibition.
To observe the effect of HSF1 on the growth of CSCs and
non-CSCs, we made a hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting HSF1. In
HEK293 cells, the Sh-HSF1 silencer speciﬁcally knocked down
ectopically expressed HSF1, but not Lef1, by up to 80% within
24 hours after co-transfection (Fig. 5B). Nearly half (48.1%) of
the TGB lymphoma cells were infected after transfection with
the Sh-HSF1 lentivirus, as determined by the expression of an
EGFP reporter within the shRNA construct (Fig. 5C). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that Sh-HSF1 knocked down approximately 80% of the endogenous HSF1 mRNA in sorted EGFP-

positive cells, relative to the mRNA levels of sorted cells
expressing scrambled shRNA (Sh-Sr) (Fig. 5C and D). With
the knockdown of HSF1, the mRNA of one of its target genes,
HSP90a (37), was correspondingly reduced. The HSF1 silencer
signiﬁcantly inhibited cell growth and eliminated the colony
formation capacity of the CSCs without the need of 17-AAG
(Fig. 5E), showing that HSF1 is positioned upstream of HSP90
and can control the level of chaperone activity. This effect was
not seen with the Sh-Sr, as it failed to affect colony formation of
the CSCs. This result shows that low levels of HSF1 are required
for maintenance of the CSCs.
HSP90 inhibition, via 17-AAG treatment or HSF1
knockdown, eliminates AML CSCs
In order to determine whether 17-AAG treatment could
selectively eliminate hematopoietic CSCs other than our lymphoma CSCs, we used a mouse model of human AML that has
been previously established (14). Similar to our lymphoma
cells, AML CSCs stably express HIF1a for their maintenance

verify that the reduction in colony formation in AML CSCs after
knockdown of HSF1 was through a reduction in HSP90, we
sorted the lentivirus-infected AML cells by gating on EGFPpositive cells (Fig. 6G) and determined the mRNA levels of
HSF1, as well as its target gene HSP90a. Knockdown of HSF1
dramatically reduced the mRNA levels of HSP90a (Fig. 6H),
verifying the requirement for functional HSP90a and HSF1 in
the maintenance of the AML CSCs. Taken together, these
results show that low doses of 17-AAG selectively eliminate
AML CSCs, possibly through the loss of HSP90-mediated
HIF1a activity. In addition our results show that a functional
HSF1 is required for AML CSC maintenance.

(14). To see whether 17-AAG also selectively targeted AML
CSCs, AML cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
17-AAG. A dose of 25 nmol/L 17-AAG increased the percentage
of apoptotic CSCs (CD34þCD38) nearly 3-fold, compared
with vehicle-treated CSCs. In contrast, 25 nmol/L 17-AAG had
little effect on the induction of apoptosis in the non-CSCs
(CD34þCD38þ; Fig. 6A and B). Although a higher dose (100
nmol/L) of 17-AAG induced apoptosis in both CSCs and nonCSCs, CSCs initiated apoptosis to a higher extent (35.5%) than
non-CSCs (13.5%; Fig. 6A and B). Similar to lymphoma CSCs, a
dramatically low dose (10 nmol/L) of 17-AAG greatly reduced
the capacity for AML CSCs to form colonies (Fig. 6C). This
colony reduction could be attributable to the inhibition of
HSP90-mediated HIF1a stability by 17-AAG, as the mRNA
levels of HIF1a were correspondingly reduced by 17-AAG
treatment (Fig. 6D). Compared with normal mouse bone
marrow (BM) cells, the AML cells also highly expressed HSF1,
phosphorylated AKT, and GSK3, in a similar manner as our
TGB lymphoma cells, indicating that AML cells possibly
respond to 17-AAG treatment via a similar mechanism as the
lymphoma cells (Fig. 6E). Accordingly, knockdown of HSF1 by
Sh-HSF1 silencer abrogated the colony formation capacity of
the AML CSCs, as compared with the Sh-Sr (Fig. 6F). Finally, to

highly express HSF1, are resistant to 17-AAG treatment. As
summarized in our model (Fig. 7), low expression of HSF1 in
CSCs renders them more susceptible to 17-AAG, as at
physiological conditions, the low amount of HSF1 likely fails
to induce HSP90a transcription in a sufﬁciently fast manner
to compensate for the loss of HSP90a. Thus, 17-AAG-mediated HSP90 inhibition abrogates the function of its client
HIF1a in CSC. In contrast, high amounts of HSF1 in nonCSCs confers greater resistance to 17-AAG, as the high levels
of HSF1 protein compensate for HSP90 inhibition by stimulating HSP90a expression at physiological conditions.
Thus, the knockdown of HSF1 eliminates the HSF1–HSP90a
axis, which supports the activation of AKT-GSK3 pathway
that is essential for non-CSC proliferation.
The chaperone HSP90 is required for the proper folding of its
client proteins that play a critical role in cancer proliferation
and survival, such as HIF1a, AKT, and HER2 (3, 4, 38–40).
Because HSP90 expression is controlled by the homotrimer of
HSF1 and/or the heterotrimer of HSF1 and HSF2 (30, 41, 42),
successful HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG naturally depends on
the levels and activation of HSF1. Deletion of HSF1 in chicken B
lymphocyte revealed that HSP90a expression is inducible and
controlled by HSF1 (37), which is consistent with our results
showing knockdown of HSF1 reduced the levels of HSP90a.
HSP90b is constitutively expressed and does not respond to the
HSF1 deletion (37). Although both of the chaperone isoforms
are capable of binding their client proteins (43), whether one
plays more of an essential role in their client's function over the
other remains undeﬁned. In terms of our CSC models, we
predicate that HSP90a plays a critical role in the maintenance
of HIF1a function.
Low doses of 17-AAG inhibit the maintenance and selfrenewal of lymphoma CSCs through blockade of HIF1a
activity, as evidenced by the loss of HIF1a transcription

Figure 7. A schematic diagram depicting the molecular mechanism
underlying the resistance of non-CSCs and the sensitivity of CSCs to 17AAG. High levels of HSF1 confer 17-AAG resistance to non-CSCs by
ensuring HSP90a expression and chaperone-mediated activation of the
AKT-GSK3 pathway, which is essential for non-CSC proliferation. In
contrast, low levels of HSF1 render CSCs sensitive to 17-AAG, as
reduced levels of HSF1 are inadequate to compensate for HSP90a
inhibition by 17-AAG, thus leading to the loss of HSP90a-mediated
HIF1a maintenance of CSCs. Knockdown of HSF1 disrupts both CSC
and non-CSC activities without a need of HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG.

activity and the reduced expression of HIF1a and its target
gene Glut1. In addition, this mechanism could be effective
in AML CSCs, as HIF1a expression was reduced by 17-AAG
treatment, and the expression patterns for the active
AKT-GSK3 pathway, HSF1, and HIF1a were similar to that
in our TGB lymphoma cells (14). Further, loss of HIF1a
activity following 17-AAG treatment induced apoptosis at
concentrations that were more than 20-fold lower than the
IC50 required for the elimination of the differentiated nonCSCs. This further illustrates the dependence of lymphoma
CSCs on HIF1a for survival. In addition, signiﬁcantly lower
concentrations of 17-AAG were able to largely eliminate
colony formation capacity of both lymphoma CSCs and AML
CSCs, indicating an impairment of self-renewal in vitro.
Although mice treated with 17-AAG had prolonged survival,
a few mice still succumbed to lymphoma. This is not
surprising, given that high expression of HSF1 in the rapidly
proliferative tumor bulk can provide resistance to 17-AAG,
showing the need for combination of conventional therapies
with CSC-targeting agents. However, consistent with this
self-renewal blockage in vitro, residual lymphoma cells present in spleens from 17-AAG–treated mice had a reduced
ability for secondary tumor initiation, illustrating a direct
inhibitory effect of 17-AAG on the lymphoma CSC's selfrenewal in vivo.
The selective elimination of mouse lymphoma CSCs and
human AML CSCs by low doses of 17-AAG provided validation
for its potential therapeutic role in targeting CSCs. 17-AAG has
been used to treat various types of hematological malignancies
in clinical phase I trials. However, only partial responses were
seen with 17-AAG therapy (44). In addition, the high doses of
17-AAG used in advanced solid tumors caused serious adverse
events, including intestinal and liver toxicity. These reports
emphasize the limitations seen with using high doses of 17AAG (45).
We revealed that the high expression of HSF1 in non-CSCs
of both lymphoma and AML helps promote resistance to 17AAG and maintain their aggressive proliferation. Similarly,
the low expression of HSF1 in TGB lymphoma CSCs, and
possibly also in AML CSCs, is essential for CSC maintenance
through regulation of HSP90a and their client proteins, such
as HIF1a. Therefore, targeting HSF1 may also efﬁciently
eradicate advanced lymphoma and AML, in addition to
potentially reducing recurrence. These results are supported
by reports showing that genetic deletion of HSF1 prevented
initiation of oncogene-induced cancers and tumor suppressor p53 null-mediated lymphoma (28, 29). Efforts to develop
HSF1 inhibitors are ongoing (46). Combined with a HSF1
inhibitor, 17-AAG may be a powerful therapy for eradicating
hematological cancers via a broad inhibition of transcriptional factors that are required for the proliferation of
differentiated cancer cells, and the maintenance of CSCs.
In addition, the low dose of 17-AAG used for the elimination
of these CSCs shows that it alone has the potential to
prevent relapse or, in combination with conventional therapy, to treat relapsed or refractory hematological cancers. In
addition, using a low dose of 17-AAG to target CSCs may
lessen toxicity arising from off target effects, as many of the

signaling pathways used by CSCs are shared with their
normal counterparts (47). Finally, our work, together with
reports from glioma (20) and chronic myeloid leukemia (48),
further extend the strategy of HSP90 inhibition as a means
for eliminating tumorigenic stem cells.
In summary, our studies show that low doses of 17-AAG
selectively target lymphoma CSCs through HSP90a-mediated
HIF1a inhibition. This selectivity is likely attributable to the
expression status of HSF1 in the CSCs and non-CSCs subsets.
Knockdown of HSF1 abrogates the activity of the 2 subsets,
providing important considerations for future drug development in patients with malignant lymphoma/leukemia. The
regulatory mechanisms among HSF1, HSP90a, and HIF1a that
are required for the maintenance of the highly proliferative
state of differentiated cancer cells and the quiescent state of
CSCs is worthy of further investigation, for future development
of cancer therapy.
