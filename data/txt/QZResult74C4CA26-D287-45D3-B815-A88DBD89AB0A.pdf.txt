Abstract
The ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling axis is increasingly implicated in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Several small-molecule FGF receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical development;
however, the predominant activity of the most advanced of these agents is against the kinase insert domain
receptor (KDR), which compromises the FGFR selectivity. Here, we report the pharmacologic proﬁle of AZD4547,
a novel and selective inhibitor of the FGFR1, 2, and 3 tyrosine kinases. AZD4547 inhibited recombinant FGFR
kinase activity in vitro and suppressed FGFR signaling and growth in tumor cell lines with deregulated FGFR
expression. In a representative FGFR-driven human tumor xenograft model, oral administration of AZD4547 was
well tolerated and resulted in potent dose-dependent antitumor activity, consistent with plasma exposure and
pharmacodynamic modulation of tumor FGFR. Importantly, at efﬁcacious doses, no evidence of anti-KDR–
related effects were observed, conﬁrming the in vivo FGFR selectivity of AZD4547. Taken together, our ﬁndings
show that AZD4547 is a novel selective small-molecule inhibitor of FGFR with potent antitumor activity against
FGFR-deregulated tumors in preclinical models. AZD4547 is under clinical investigation for the treatment of
FGFR-dependent tumors. Cancer Res; 72(8); 2045–56. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their receptors carry
out key roles in multiple biologic processes including tissue
repair, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and embryonic development. The FGF receptor (FGFR) family comprises 4 main
members (FGFR1–4), some of which have multiple protein
isoforms as a consequence of alternative splicing (1). FGFRs
have a core structure containing an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an
intracellular kinase domain. FGF ligand binding results in
FGFR dimerization, followed by receptor autophosphorylation

and activation of downstream signaling pathways. In addition
to the vast complexity of a system represented by 4 receptors
and 18 ligands, additional control is provided by the interaction
of heparin and heparin sulphate proteoglycans, which modulate ligand binding to receptor (2). Cell- and tissue-speciﬁc
receptor expression patterns provide a ﬁnal level of control,
which reﬂects their differential roles across a variety of tissues
and cell lineages.
Aside from their normal physiologic roles described above,
FGFs and FGFRs are emerging as oncogenes that drive proliferation of a signiﬁcant proportion of human tumors and that
can also mediate resistance to both cytotoxic and targeted
agents. Deregulation of FGFR signaling has been documented
in clinical samples of breast (3), multiple myeloma (4), bladder
(5), endometrial (6), gastric (7), and prostate cancers (8). The
most frequently reported tumor-associated ﬁnding is receptor
overexpression due to gene ampliﬁcation or aberrant transcriptional regulation. Consequently, tumor cells acquire
enhanced sensitivity to FGF ligands or become activated
through spontaneous ligand-independent dimerization (9–
13). Genetically altered forms of FGFR proteins (e.g., chimeric,
truncated, and mutated) have also been identiﬁed in human
tumors, resulting in receptors, which are either constitutively
active or exhibit altered ligand dependence (12, 14). Moreover,
receptor activation through gene fusion is exempliﬁed by the
discovery of numerous FGFR1 fusion proteins in myeloproliferative disorders (15–17). Finally, FGF2 and FGFR4 have both
been associated with protection against etoposide- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in vitro (18–21), whereas increased

circulating FGF2 levels show an association with tumor progression following clinical suppression of VEGF signaling (22,
23).
Blockade of FGF/FGFR signaling as a therapeutic approach
to cancer is gaining momentum with a number of targeted
kinase inhibitors currently in development. The most clinically
advanced of these agents are mainly mixed kinase inhibitors
with dominant anti-KDR (kinase insert domain receptor)
pharmacology (brivanib alaninate; ref. 24), dovitinib (11),
BIBF-1120 (25), and SU6668 (26). As such, their anti-FGFR
activity is often relatively weak and thus, we do not believe that
these agents offer the opportunity to fully test the anti-FGFR
hypothesis because of the confounding effects of their other
pharmacologic mechanisms. Accordingly, we postulate that
there is a need for compounds that are more FGFR-selective,
which can be used to more robustly test the FGFR tumor–
driven hypothesis. In this report, we describe the preclinical
proﬁle of AZD4547, a potent and selective FGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor currently in phase I clinical studies.

Materials and Methods
AZD4547
N-[5-[2-(3,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]-4-(3,5diemthylpiperazin-1-yl)benzamide (AZD4547, AstraZeneca; Fig.
1) was synthesized according to the processes described in the
International Patent Application Publication Number WO2008/
075068, in particular as described in Example 80. The free base of
AZD4547 (molecular weight ¼ 463.6) was used in all preclinical
studies. For in vitro studies, AZD4547 was prepared as a 10
mmol/L stock solution and diluted in the relevant assay media.
For in vivo studies, AZD4547 was formulated in a 1% (v/v)
solution of polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate (Tween-80) in
deionized water. Animals were given AZD4547 (1.5–50 mg/kg)
or vehicle control once daily or twice daily by oral gavage.
Cell culture
KG1a, Sum52-PE, MCF7, and KMS11 cell lines were routinely
grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf
serum (FCS; Biochrom AG) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen). The KMS11 cell line was obtained from Jonathan Keats
(Scottsdale, Arizona), KG1a from American Type Culture
Collection, MCF7 from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund,
and Sum52-PE from Asterand. These cell lines were genetically
tested and authenticated with the Powerplex 16 System (Promega) and were not cultured for more than 6 months before
conducting the work described here.

Inhibition of cellular receptor phosphorylation
For FGFR phosphorylation studies, FGFR1, 3, or 4–transfected Cos-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 3% FCS. For FGFR2, Sum52-PE cells were cultured
in RPMI-1640 (Gibco), growth media supplemented with
2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% FBS. Following 1-hour incubation with AZD4547, media were removed; cells were ﬁxed,
permeabilized, and then incubated with monoclonal antiphospho-FGFR antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000)
for 1 hour followed by incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor
594 secondary antibody (1:500) and Hoechst (1:1,000) for 1 hour.
Fluorescence measurement was conducted with Arrayscan
(Cellomics).
For KDR phosphorylation studies, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from PromoCell and
cultured according to the supplier's protocol. Cells were
incubated with AZD4547 for 90 minutes and then stimulated
for 5 minutes with VEGF ligand (25 ng per well). Cells were
lysed with standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
containing phosphatase/protease inhibitors. Lysates were
analyzed with the human phospho-VEGF R2 (KDR; R&D
systems) ELISA protocol according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
For insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) phosphorylation studies, Rþ cells were derived from murine transgenic
IGF1R knockouts and then stably transfected with human
IGF1R. Cells cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with
1% heat-inactivated FCS and 1% L-glutamine were incubated
with AZD4547 and then stimulated with IGF ligand (Gropep
IMOOl), followed by ﬁxation, blocking, and incubation with a
rabbit anti-phospho IGF1R/IR antibody (Biosource;1:350) for 1
hour. Secondary detection and measurement was carried out
with an Acumen Explorer HTS Reader (TTP Labtech Ltd.) at an
excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of
530 nm.
In vitro protein expression analysis and kinase inhibition
studies
Cells were treated with AZD4547 or control for 3 hours at
37 C and then stimulated with 10 ng/mL aFGF/bFGF (Sigma)
and 10 mg/mL heparin for 20 minutes. Western blotting was
conducted with standard SDS-PAGE procedures and antibody
incubation carried out overnight at 4 C. Antibodies were
obtained from the following sources: FGFR1 (Epitomics),
FGFR2 and FRS2 (R&D Systems), FGFR3 proteins (Abcam),
a-tubulin-B512 and Bcl2 (C2; Santa Cruz), and BIM (Millipore).
All other antibodies were sourced from Cell Signalling Technologies. Secondary antibodies were applied and immunoreactive proteins visualized with "SuperSignal West Dura"
Chemiluminescence substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce).
In vitro cell line proliferation studies
In vitro antiproliferative activity was measured as described
previously (27). Each experiment was carried out at least in
triplicate and data presented as geometric means.

AZD4547: A Novel, Potent, and Selective FGFR Inhibitor

In vitro cell-cycle and apoptotic induction analysis
Cell lines were incubated with ﬁxed concentrations of
AZD4547 for 72 hours. For ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), cells were ﬁxed with 70% ethanol and then incubated
with propidium iodide/RNase A (Sigma) labeling solution. Cellcycle proﬁles were assessed with a FACSCalibur instrument
and CellQuest analysis software (Becton Dickinson). For apoptotic analysis, cells and media were gently harvested and
centrifuged, followed by washing of cell pellets. Cells were then
processed for Annexin V-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
staining and propidium iodide uptake according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abcam). The proportion of cells staining positive for Annexin V were then assessed with a FACSCalibur instrument and quadrant sorting was done by CellQuest
analysis software (Becton Dickinson).
Murine plasma pharmacokinetic analyses
Plasma samples were extracted by protein precipitation in
acetonitrile, followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) detection. In short, plasma samples
and standards were quenched with acetonitrile and internal
standard and centrifuged. Supernatant was diluted 10-fold
with deionized water and the samples were analyzed by LC/
MS-MS with Masslynx and data processed by Quanlynx software (Waters).
Immunohistochemistry
Antigen retrieval was carried out on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded tissues with a RHS-1 microwave vacuum processor
(Milestone) at 110 C for 5 minutes in (pH 6) retrieval buffer
(S1699; Dako) and the following primary antibodies used:
custom rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to COOH-terminal
peptide of mouse CD31 (CHG-CD31-PI, AstraZeneca; 1:600),
mouse monoclonal anti Ki-67 MIB-1 (Dako M7240; 1:100), and
rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp 175; #9661, Cell
Signaling Technology; 1:100). The appropriate Envision or
biotinylated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin secondary antibodies were used (K4007/K4003; Dako, PK-6101; Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and staining was detected with diaminobenzidine (K3468; Dako). Finally, sections were counterstained with
Carazzi's hematoxylin and image analysis was conducted with
the Aperio Digital Pathology System (Aperio Technologies,
Inc). Analysis thresholds were set and applied to all tumors
within the study by the Aperio Micro Vessel Density (MVD) and
nuclear software algorithms (CD31, cleaved caspase-3, and Ki67). MVD was expressed as mean number of CD31-positive
vascular structures per mm2 of viable tumor. Nuclear staining
was expressed as a percentage positive score (number of
positive nuclei of the total number of nuclei stained).
In vivo tumor studies
Swiss derived nude (nu/nu) and severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID; Charles River) were housed in negativepressure isolators (PFI Systems Ltd.) at AstraZeneca. All
experiments were carried out on 8- to 12-week-old female
mice in full accordance with the UK Home Ofﬁce Animal
(Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act 1986. Tumor xenografts were established by s.c. injection into the left ﬂank with 0.1 mL tumor cells

www.aacrjournals.org

(1  106 for LoVo, 1  107 for HCT-15, and 1  107 for Calu-6) or
0.2 mL (2  107 for KMS11 and KG1a) mixed 1:1 with Matrigel
(Becton Dickinson), with the exception of LoVo and HCT-15,
which did not include Matrigel. Mice were randomized into
control and treatment groups when tumors reached the determined size of more than 0.2 cm3. Tumor volume (measured by
caliper), animal body weight, and tumor condition were
recorded twice weekly for the duration of the study. Tumor
volume was calculated as described previously (28).
Pharmacodynamic studies
Tumor samples and blood were collected from KMS11
tumor–bearing mice at various time points after single dose
of either AZD4547 or vehicle. Frozen tumor samples were lysed
in 1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) containing
phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma) with a Fast Prep
Homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). Tumor phospho-FGFR3 was
measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (DYC2719, R&D systems).
In vivo cardiovascular studies
Blood pressure, heart rate, and activity patterns were collected from conscious, unrestrained rats with the commercially available Data Sciences International telemetry system
by the methodology described previously (29).

Results
AZD4547 is a highly potent inhibitor of FGFR tyrosine
kinases 1 to 3 and shows selectivity versus a range of
additional kinases
AZD4547 potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activities of
recombinant FGFR1, 2, and 3 in vitro (IC50 values of 0.2, 2.5, and
1.8 nmol/L, respectively; Table 1) and displays weaker activity
against FGFR4 (IC50 ¼ 165 nmol/L). In vitro drug selectivity was
examined against a diverse panel of representative human
kinases and AZD4547 shown to inhibit recombinant VEGFR2
(KDR) kinase activity with an IC50 of 24 nmol/L. However, when
compared with FGFR1, this represents a selectivity of approximately 120-fold. Excellent selectivity for FGFR was observed
across a range of unrelated tyrosine and serine/threonine
kinases including IGFR (>2,900-fold), CDK2 (>50,000-fold), and
p38 (>50,000-fold). Broader kinase selectivity was explored
with 0.1 mmol/L of AZD4547 against a range of recombinant
kinases incubated with ATP at or near the appropriate enzyme
Km concentration. No enzyme inhibition was detected against
ALK, CHK1, EGFR, MAPK1, MEK1, p70S6K, PDGFR, PKB, Src,
Tie2, and PI3-kinase (data not shown).
Because of potent AZD4547 recombinant enzyme inhibition,
FGFR1–4, IGFR, and KDR were established as cellular phosphorylation assays and used to generate AZD4547 IC50 values
(Table 1). In cells, AZD4547 potently inhibits autophosphorylation of FGFR1, 2, and 3 tyrosine kinases (IC50 values of 12, 2,
and 40 nmol/L, respectively; Table 1) and displays weaker inhibition of FGFR4 cellular kinase activity (IC50 ¼ 142 nmol/L).
Signiﬁcantly weaker inhibitory activity was observed versus
cellular KDR and IGFR ligand–induced phosphorylation (IC50
values of 258 and 828 nmol/L, respectively), representing
approximately 20- and 70-fold selectivity over cellular FGFR1.

The ability of AZD4547 to inhibit a range of human recombinant kinase activities was tested using ATP concentrations
at, or just below, the respective Km. Data represent the mean
 SEM of at least 3 separate determinations. IC50 values
denoted as "greater than" denote the inability to reach 50%
inhibition of maximal activity at the highest tested
concentration.

AZD4547 has potent in vitro antiproliferative effects on
tumor cell lines with deregulated FGFR expression
Three tumor cell lines were selected on the basis of known
abnormalities in FGFR expression and signaling. KG1a is an
acute myeloid leukemia cell line that expresses a truncated
wild-type FGFR1 fusion protein (30); Sum52-PE is a breast cell
line that expresses wild-type FGFR2 (31), and the KMS11
multiple myeloma line expresses a t(4;14) translocated/
Y373C mutated FGFR3 protein (32). FGFR protein levels were
assessed by Western blotting and overexpression was conﬁrmed relative to a control cell line (MCF7) with no identiﬁed
defects in FGFR expression or signaling (Fig. 2). The ability of
AZD4547 to inhibit in vitro proliferation of these lines over a 3day period was assessed with a standard metabolism-based
proliferation assay. IC50 values ranged from 18 nmol/L in KG1a
cells to 281 nmol/L in KMS11 cells (Table 2). Notably, MCF7 cell
proliferation was unaffected by incubation with AZD4547 up to
a concentration of 30 mmol/L. Moreover, AZD4547 was inactive
against more than 100 additional tumor cell lines (Supplementary Table S1), showing that AZD4547 has potent in vitro
antiproliferative activity only against tumor cell lines expressing deregulated FGFRs.
AZD4547 potently inhibits FGFR phosphorylation and
downstream signaling in human tumor cell lines
To assess modulation of FGFR phosphorylation and signaling by AZD4547, cell lines were treated with drug and lysates
analyzed by Western blotting. All 3 cell lines showed inhibition
of FGFR and mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) pro-

tein phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A–C).
With the exception of the KMS11 cell line, the concentrations
of AZD4547 required to inhibit cellular FGFR phosphorylation
were in good agreement with the in vitro proliferation IC50
values (Table 2). The phosphorylation of FRS2 and PLCg,
downstream markers of FGFR signaling, was also inhibited
(Fig. 3D and E). Notably, AKT phosphorylation (which has been
described to couple often to FGFR signaling) was unaffected by
AZD4547 in KG1a and KMS11 lines but did show modulation
by AZD4547 treatment in the breast cell lines, MCF7 (data not
shown) and Sum52-PE. Thus, at the cellular level, AZD4547
potently inhibits FGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling affected through FRS2, PLCg, and MAPK.
The mechanism of growth inhibition by AZD4547 is cell
line dependent
To understand the mechanism by which AZD4547 exerts
antiproliferative activity in vitro, cellular Annexin V apoptosis
assays, ﬂow cytometric cell-cycle analysis, and Western blotting were conducted. Three drug concentrations were chosen
(30 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and 1 mmol/L) to ensure good

coverage of the approximate IC50 values for cellular proliferation and FGFR phosphorylation. Figure 4 shows the cell-cycle
proﬁles of all 3 lines, following 3 days of treatment with
AZD4547 (mean percent of cells in cell-cycle phase  SEM,
n ¼ 3). KG1a cells show dramatic increase in the G1 phase
population upon treatment with all 3 doses of AZD4547 (Fig.
4A), with no increases in the sub-G1 population. The Sum52-PE
breast and KMS11 multiple myeloma cell lines both displayed
an acute sensitivity to induction of cell death (sub-G1 phase)
following treatment with all doses of AZD4547 (Fig. 4B and C).
Relative to untreated control cells, Annexin V staining conﬁrmed signiﬁcant apoptotic induction in Sum52-PE and
KMS11 lines, but not in KG1a (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the
lack of any in vitro antiproliferative effect of AZD4547 on the
MCF7 breast cell line, no signiﬁcant cell-cycle or apoptotic
changes were observed following incubation with AZD4547 at
any of the doses tested (Supplementary Fig. S1). Western
blotting conﬁrmed clear induction of the apoptotic markers,
cleaved caspase-3, and PARP (Fig. 4E), in treated Sum52-PE
and KMS11 lysates, but not in KG1a, consistent with the
Annexin V and cell-cycle data. Further analysis showed
increases in proapoptotic BIM protein levels in all 3 lines
following AZD4547 treatment and high-level basal expression
of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 in KG1a cells, but not in
Sum52-PE or KMS11 (Fig. 4E).
Thus, at least in the lines tested here, cell fate in response to
AZD4547 treatment is likely determined by the relative levels of
key pro- and antiapoptotic proteins.
AZD4547 in vivo antitumor activity is associated with
dose proportional pharmacodynamic modulation of
phospho-FGFR3 and reduced KMS11 tumor cell
proliferation
To assess AZD4547 in vivo efﬁcacy, female SCID mice
bearing KMS11 tumors were randomized and treated chronically with AZD4547 at a range of well-tolerated doses. Oral
AZD4547 treatment resulted in dose-dependent tumor
growth inhibition. Twice daily administration of AZD4547
at 3 mg/kg gave statistically signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition of 53% (P < 0.0005 by one-tailed t test) when compared
with vehicle-treated controls, whereas doses of 12.5 mg/kg
once daily and 6.25 mg/kg twice daily resulted in complete
tumor stasis (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5A). A further efﬁcacy study in
the KG1a model with 12.5 mg/kg once daily AZD4547
resulted in 65% tumor growth inhibition (P ¼ 0.002; Supplementary Fig. S2).

www.aacrjournals.org

To assess in vivo modulation of FGFR phosphorylation,
single doses of AZD4547 were orally administered to KMS11
tumor–bearing SCID mice and tumors harvested at various
time points postdose for measurement of phosphorylated
FGFR3 with a sandwich ELISA assay. Total plasma concentrations of AZD4547 clearly show a direct relationship with
inhibition of FGFR3 phosphorylation within KMS11 tumors
in vivo (Fig. 5B). A further study using a single 6.25 mg/kg dose
of AZD4547 was conducted to deﬁne the duration and magnitude of the pharmacodynamic effect in tumors. Within 15
minutes of drug administration, the levels of phosphorylated
FGFR3 decreased to 40% to 50% of control levels and inhibition
was sustained for at least 6 hours. At the 16-hour time point,
phosphorylated FGFR3 had returned to control levels (Fig. 5C).
These data conﬁrm good modulation of tumor phosphoFGFR3 levels for at least 6 hours, consistent with the plasma
exposure of AZD4547.
To deﬁne the mechanism(s) through which AZD4547 elicits
KMS11 tumor growth inhibition in vivo, KMS11 tumor–bearing
mice were treated with 6.25 mg/kg AZD4547 twice daily for 7
days and tumors processed for immunohistochemical analysis.
Tumor sections were stained using antibodies to cleaved
caspase-3, Ki-67, and CD31, representing markers of cellular
apoptosis, proliferation, and vascularity, respectively. AZD4547
treatment caused a signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of
cells staining positive for nuclear Ki-67 (Fig. 5D and E).
However, despite showing an increase in the AZD4547-treated
sections, the difference in cleaved caspase-3 staining between
controls versus AZD4547-treated tumor sections did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance. Similarly, AZD4547 treatment did not
have any signiﬁcant effect on CD31-positive vessel staining in
KMS11 xenografts (Fig. 5D and E), showing that at efﬁcacious
dose levels, AZD4547 does not exhibit antiangiogenic effects. In
summary, AZD4547 shows dose proportional antitumor efﬁcacy in an FGFR3-driven xenograft model, concurrent with
pharmacodynamic target modulation, and with evidence of a
predominantly antiproliferative mechanism in vivo.
AZD4547 antitumor efﬁcacy is not attributable to
inhibition of KDR-driven functional effects in vivo
It is well documented that inhibition of VEGF signaling with
agents such as cediranib (KDR inhibitor) can lead to hypertension (29, 33). Therefore, the effect of AZD4547 on blood

with vehicle-dosed animals (Fig. 6A represents the diastolic
pressure for vehicle control and AZD4547). The free plasma
exposure of AZD4547 after dosing at 10 mg/kg in rats is
equivalent to the exposure in mouse, which results in greater
than 60% tumor growth inhibition in the KMS11 model. These
data show that at equivalent efﬁcacious doses, AZD4547 has no
signiﬁcant effect on blood pressure and therefore lacks in vivo
anti-KDR activity.
Broad antitumor efﬁcacy in preclinical xenograft models is a
feature of agents, which act predominantly through antiangiogenic mechanisms. To examine the breadth of its activity,
AZD4547 was assessed in a number of models that have been
shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of VEGF signaling, such as
cediranib (28). Mice bearing Calu-6 (lung) tumors were treated
chronically with either 3 mg/kg cediranib once daily or 6.25
mg/kg AZD4547 twice daily. Cediranib resulted in signiﬁcant
tumor growth inhibition (64%), which is consistent with previous reports (28); however, AZD4547 lacked efﬁcacy in this
model (Fig. 6B). Similarly, dosing of 6.25 mg/kg orally twice
daily AZD4547 was also inactive in 2 additional cediranibsensitive xenograft models—HCT-15 and LoVo (Table 3).
Taken together, the telemetry, immunohistochemical, and
efﬁcacy data suggest that the antitumor effects of AZD4547 are
not likely to be attributable to inhibition of KDR activity and
are a result of its potent and selective FGFR proﬁle.

Discussion
This report provides the ﬁrst pharmacologic proﬁle of the
pyrazoloamide derivative, AZD4547, an orally bioavailable
selective inhibitor of FGFR tyrosine kinases with potential as
a targeted antitumor therapy.
AZD4547 is a potent inhibitor of FGFR tyrosine kinases
1, 2, and 3 and is also selective versus a range of other
related kinases, such as KDR, IGF, PI3Ka, and AKT. Potent
nanomolar IC50 values were obtained when AZD4547 was
examined against recombinant FGFR kinases (FGFR1, IC50 ¼
0.2 nmol/L), whereas activity versus KDR was approximately
120-fold lower (KDR, IC50 ¼ 24 nmol/L). Cellular phosphorylation data conﬁrmed this dominant FGFR selectivity
proﬁle with an approximate 20-fold difference over KDR
(FGFR1, cellular IC50 ¼ 12 nmol/L; KDR, cellular IC50 ¼
258 nmol/L).
Our data show that AZD4547 is a potent cell growth inhibitor versus tumor cell lines with known irregularities in FGFR
expression. Several studies have indirectly established that
elevated FGFR protein levels correlate with receptor ligand
independence and result in mitogenic growth (10–13). Qian
and colleagues have previously validated FGFR3 as a proliferative driver within the KMS11 multiple myeloma cell line,
which contains mutated (Y373C) and overexpressed FGFR3

antiproliferative sensitivity to AZD4547. Our chosen cell lines
represent both wild-type and point-mutated FGFR proteins,
indicating that AZD4547 is active against the tyrosine kinase
activity of both the wild-type and mutant forms of FGFR used
here. Importantly, the lack of any AZD4547 antiproliferative
effects in FGFR nonderegulated tumor cell lines (including
MCF7) indicates a lack of nonspeciﬁc cytotoxicity within the
effective drug concentration range.
AZD4547 inhibits FGFR downstream signaling and induces
both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects dependent upon the
cellular background. In the cell lines tested here, incubation
with AZD4547 resulted in potent inhibition of cellular FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3, FRS2, and PLCg phosphorylation, whereas

concomitant inhibition of pMAPK conﬁrmed that FGFR signaling remains coupled to the MAPK cascade [AZD4547 is
inactive vs. recombinant MAP–extracellular signal—regulated
(ERK) kinase (MEK) and MAPK enzymes; data not shown].
This requirement for a coupled FGFR-MAPK signaling pathway suggests clear implications for an AZD4547 clinical patient
selection strategy. Activating mutations within the ras gene
family occur with a frequency of up to 30% across a diverse
range of human tumors (36, 37) and, in the case of FGFR,
circumvent the dependence of cells on ligand-induced stimulation (11). However, the mutual exclusivity of FGFR and Ras
mutations observed across several tumor types, including
pancreatic (38), multiple myeloma (39), and urothelial

carcinoma (40), suggests that these oncogenes use common
signaling pathways to maintain the tumor phenotype. Because
tumor growth driven by deregulated FGFR expression (and
hence sensitive to AZD4547) is unlikely to be reliant on mutant
Ras signaling, a patient selection strategy based on deregulated
FGFR alone is suggested.
Sum52-PE breast cancer cells are dependent on FGFR2
signaling to activate signal transduction pathways involving
FRS2, MAPK, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K; ref. 10).
Published data support a key role for FRS2 signaling in
activating both the MAPK to induce cell proliferation and
differentiation and also PI3K to activate cell survival pathways
(41). Consistent with these data, AZD4547 shows potent inhibition of both pERK and pAKT cellular phosphorylation and
concomitant induction of apoptosis in Sum52-PE cells. The
lack of pAKT modulation by AZD4547 in KG1a and KMS11
cells, however, is likely explained by the ﬁnding that PI3K and
AKT are overactivated in most myeloma and leukemia cell
lines (42). Indeed, KG1a cells are known to contain a hypermethylated PTEN promoter (43), whereas KMS11 harbors a
constitutively active AKT (42). As neither line shows modulation of pAKT by AZD4547, we suggest that the antiproliferative
versus apoptotic response to AZD4547 is modulated by the
relative balance of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. In KG1a
cells, although AZD4547 treatment induces an increase in
proapoptotic BIM expression, the relatively high level of antiapoptotic Bcl2 protein would appear to protect against apoptotic induction. Conversely, within Sum52-PE and KMS11
cells, despite induction of BIM expression by AZD4547, basal
Bcl2 levels remain low or undetectable, thus allowing apoptosis
to occur in these lines. Accordingly, at least in the lines tested
here, we propose that AZD4547 induces apoptosis via induction of BIM expression only in those lines where levels of the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 are low or undetectable.
In preclinical xenograft models, AZD4547 exposure correlated with in vivo antitumor efﬁcacy and pharmacodynamic
modulation of target and proliferation endpoints. Dose-related

AZD4547 efﬁcacy was shown in SCID mice bearing established
KMS11 tumors (99% tumor growth inhibition with 6.25 mg/kg
twice daily dosing). Despite observing substantial in vivo
inhibition of phospho-FGFR3 levels in KMS11 tumors at a
dose of 6.25 mg/kg, we were unable to conﬁrm statistically
signiﬁcant apoptotic induction by a cleaved caspase-3
immunohistochemical endpoint but did observe a signiﬁcant
reduction in Ki-67 tumor staining. The apparent phenotypic
disconnect observed here between potent induction of KMS11
cell apoptosis by AZD4547 in vitro, compared with slowed
growth in the absence of any detectable apoptosis in vivo,
may be explained by the time points of tumor sampling.
Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and CC3 was conducted on tumors after 7 days of AZD4547 treatment, which,
based on the AZD4547 antitumor preclinical efﬁcacy data,
describes a phase of slowed tumor growth but precedes
any tumor stasis effects (observed at >14 days). Indeed, this
interpretation is supported by similar studies using PD173074
where low in vitro concentrations resulted in KMS11 cell
apoptosis after 4 days of incubation, while in vivo apoptotic
markers only became visible within KMS11 xenograft sections
after 9 days of twice daily dosing (44). Further work is currently
underway to conﬁrm this interpretation and investigate
the time dependency of the pharmacodynamic changes elicited by AZD4547.
The in vivo data presented here are consistent with
AZD4547 being a predominantly FGFR-selective small-molecule inhibitor. Treatment with AZD4547 did not result in
the well-characterized blood pressure changes associated
with acute KDR inhibition in telemetered rat studies (29, 33).
Furthermore, we detected no signiﬁcant changes in CD31
immunohistochemical staining in KMS11 tumor xenograft
sections at an efﬁcacious dose and time point, nor were we
able to show efﬁcacy in KDR-sensitive xenograft tumor
models. Accordingly, we believe that AZD4547 is capable
of clinically testing an FGFR tumor–driven hypothesis, aiming to select patients based on deregulated tumor FGFR
expression.
In summary, using a panel of tumor cell lines in vitro, we have
shown that endogenous FGFR protein expression levels predict
antiproliferative sensitivity to the novel, potent FGFR-selective
agent, AZD4547. Our data show potent modulation of phospho-FGFR signaling within FGFR-deregulated cell lines and
highlight both proapoptotic and antiproliferative phenotypes,
dictated by the relative expressions of key pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. AZD4547 inhibits the growth of KMS11 tumor
xenografts at doses (and plasma exposure), which cause pharmacodynamic modulation of tumor phospho-FGFR. Furthermore, AZD4547 shows no in vivo evidence of anti-KDR–related
efﬁcacy or physiology and is well-tolerated. These data support
further investigation of AZD4547 as a targeted therapeutic
option for patients with tumors harboring deregulated FGFR
expression. AZD4547 is currently being evaluated in phase I
clinical trials.
