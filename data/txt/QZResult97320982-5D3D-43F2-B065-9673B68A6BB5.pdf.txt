ABSTRACT
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved survival pathway in eukaryote and is
frequently upregulated in cancer cells after chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Thus
induction of autophagy has emerged as a drug resistance mechanism. In this study,
we found that crizotinib induced a high level of autophagy in lung cancer cells through
inhibition of STAT3. Ectopic expression of wild-type or constitutive activated STAT3
significantly suppressed the effect of crizotinib on autophagy. Interestingly, crizotinibmediated inhibition of STAT3 is in a step-wise manner. Firstly it inhibited cytoplasmic
STAT3, which leads to the phosphorylation of EIF2A, then inhibited nuclear STAT3,
which leads to the downregulation of BCL-2. Cell death induced by crizotinib was
greatly enhanced after the inhibition of autophagy by the pharmacological inhibitors
or shRNAs against Beclin-1. Moreover, the autophagy inhibitor HCQ significantly
augmented the anti-tumor effect of crizotinib in a mouse xenograft model. In
conclusion, crizotinib can induce cytoprotective autophagy by suppression of STAT3
in lung cancer cells. Thus, autophagy inhibition represents a promising approach to
improve the efficacy of crizotinib in the treatment of targeted lung cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

5-year survival for patients with NSCLC is still under
20%.[1] Currently, a series of driver mutations has been
identified in lung cancer. As an example, the targeting of
EGFR and EML4-ALK have led to encouraging results,
but acquired resistance generally follows within 1 year.
The mechanism of acquired resistance to targeted therapy
includes secondary mutations, MET amplifications, IGFR
activation, PIK3CA mutations, and KRAS mutations,
among others. [2-5] Thus, the investigation of novel
targeted strategies as well as of new ways to counter

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality
worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
constitutes 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. Most patients
have already reached an advanced stage at the time of
diagnosis. Chemotherapy is the main therapeutic strategy
for patients with metastatic disease. However, even with
the emergence of molecular targeted therapy, the overall

acquired resistance of targeted agents is a logic next step.
Crizotinib is a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor
of MET, EML4-ALK and ROS1. It was approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration as an initial
treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLCs
that harbor the EML4-ALK fusion protein [6], and was
also recommended for patients with MET amplification.
MET encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase
that is activated by hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor
(HGF/SF). Binding of HGF to MET leads to receptor
dimerization and transphosphorylation of the tyrosine
residues Tyr 1234 and Tyr 1235 of the receptor kinase
domain; this initiates downstream signaling pathways
including the RAS-ERK-MAPK cascade, the PI3KAKT-MTOR pathway and the STAT3 signaling pathway.
These signaling pathways ultimately lead to increases
in cell proliferation, survival and motility.[7] Protein
overexpression or gene amplification of MET has been
implicated in the oncogenesis of various cancer types,
especially lung cancer.[8, 9] Early data in a phase I clinical
trial (NCT00585195) have indicated that crizotinib has
potent anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced
NSCLC with MET amplification.[10] However, acquired
drug resistance inevitably occurs in the application of
crizotinib just as with other targeted agents. Possible
mechanisms of resistance include secondary gate-keeper
mutations as well as the activation of signaling pathways
that bypass MET signaling.[4, 11, 12]
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic
process that sequesters nonessential intracellular
components for lysosomal degradation in eukaryotic cells.
Autophagy is triggered by a variety of stress stimuli and
is widely involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases,
especially cancer.[13] When exposed to cellular stress
conditions, such as mutations, radiation, chemotherapy
or targeted agents, autophagy is activated to promote
the survival of tumor cells under these unfavorable
conditions.[14] Thus, autophagy has constantly been
referred to as a potential pathway of drug resistance.
[15] Accumulating evidence indicates that inhibition
of autophagy enhances the efficacy of cytotoxic agents
such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, as well as that of targeted
agents such as sorafenib and cetuximab [16-19]. The
most recent reports have shown that the autophagy
inhibitor hydroxychloroquine is tolerable and potentially
effective in combination with the MTOR-targeted
agent temsirolimus [20] and the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib [21] in phase I trials (www.clinicaltrials.
gov). In our previous study, we showed that the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors gefitinib and
erlotinib both induced autophagy in lung cancer cells. The
inhibition of autophagy increased the sensitivity of lung
cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors, which suggests a novel
approach for the enhancement of targeted therapy for lung
cancer [22]. Given that autophagy plays an important
role in resistance to anti-cancer drugs, we ask whether
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

autophagy can be activated by the multikinase inhibitor
crizotinib, thereby impairing the sensitivity of lung cancer
cells to its anti-tumor activity.
In the present study, we first demonstrated that
crizotinib activated autophagy in lung cancer cells through
the inhibition of cytoplasmic as well as nuclear STAT3
signaling. The blockage of autophagy enhanced the antitumor activity of crizotinib both in vitro and in vivo, which
suggests a novel and promising strategy for the increase in
clinical efficacy of crizotinib in potential targeted patients.

RESULTS
Crizotinib induces autophagy in multiple lung
cancer cell lines
First, we tested the growth inhibitory properties of
crizotinib on a series of lung cancer cells lines including
SPC-A1, HCC827, H1975 and A549, and found that
although none of these cell lines harbors an EML4-ALK
fusion protein, most of them were responsive to crizotinib
treatment (Fig. 1A). Among these 4 cell lines, SPC-A1
was the most sensitive to crizotinib treatment with an IC50
of approximately 2 μM, while A549 cells, which harbor a
KRAS mutation, was the most resistant to crizotinib with
an IC50 of over 4 μM. HCC827 and H1975 cells, which
have EGFR mutations, exhibited moderate sensitivity.
However, all of these cell lines express MET. To evaluate
the effect of crizotinib on autophagy, we then examined the
occurrence of autophagy in crizotinib-treated lung cancer
cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, crizotinib induced the lipidation
of LC3-II and degradation of p62 in a dose-dependent
manner in SPC-A1, A549 and H2228 cells, which
indicates the autophagy was activated by crizotinib. To
further confirm this observation, the compartmentalization
of endogenous LC3-II in cells treated with crizotinib was
monitored by indirect immunofluorescence staining.
Specific punctate distribution of endogenous LC3-II was
observed in crizotinib-treated cells (Fig. 1C & Fig. S1).
After treatment, the percentage of FITC–LC3 positive
cells with punctate staining increased to 75.4% and 83.4%
in SPC-A1 and A549 cell lines, respectively (Fig. 1D). A
proportion of LC3-positive cells with punctate staining colocalized with lysosomes, which indicates the formation
of autolysosomes. In addition, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was used to verify the formation of
autophagosomes in crizotinib-treated cells. As shown in
Fig. 2, crizotinib-treated cells exhibited the accumulation
of large autophagic vacuoles with a typical double-layer
membrane and organelle remnants, whereas only a few
vacuoles were observed in control cells.
Collectively, these results demonstrated that
crizotinib induces autophagy in lung cancer cells.

the regulation of autophagy, we then hypothesized
that crizotinib-induced autophagy is mediated through
inhibition of MET. As expected, the phosphorylation of
MET was significantly inhibited by crizotinib in SPC-A1
cells, while total MET was unaffected (Fig. 3A). The
phosphorylation of STAT3, AKT and MTOR in SPC-A1
cells was also repressed by crizotinib in a dose-dependent
manner, while the total levels of these proteins were
unaffected. However, the phosphorylation of ERK was not
affected by crizotinib treatment, which suggests that the
ERK pathway is probably not a downstream responder of
crizotinib targeting (Fig. 3A). We then sought to confirm,

Crizotinib was first recognized as a small molecule
inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase and
was approved by the FDA for clinical use in 2011.[23]
Three prominent pathways lie downstream of MET (the
RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT-MTOR and STAT3 signaling
pathways), all of which can regulate autophagy.[7,
24] Provided that MET is a direct target of crizotinib,
and its downstream pathways are closely involved in

by siRNA interference, that the inhibition of MET could
induce autophagy. The knockdown of MET in SPC-A1
cells was able to induce the transition of LC3-I to LC3II (Fig. S2A) as well as the punctate staining pattern
as observed after immunofluorescence staining (Fig.
S2B&C). The addition of its ligand HGF could rescue the
crizotinib-induced LC3 puncta formation in SPC-A1 cells
(Fig. S2D). However, we noticed that the direct inhibition
of MET did not yield a remarkable autophagic response as
shown with crizotinib treatment, as the average percentage
of LC3-positive cells with punctate staining was 49% in

siMET-transfected SPC-A1 cells (Fig. S2C) but was
75.4% in crizotinib-treated cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, we tested
a series of lung cancer cell lines that reportedly expressed
MET. Unexpectedly, although varied expression of total
MET was detected in all of the cell lines tested, MET
phosphorylation was not commonly present in these cell
lines. However, remarkably, in the three cell lines (A549,
H1975, H827), autophagy was induced by crizotinib.
Not all of these cell lines demonstrated a decreased level
of p-MTOR, p-AKT or p-ERK, and the only common
downregulated signaling molecule was p-STAT3 (Fig.

3B), which suggested crizotinib-induced autophagy was
mediated through the inhibition of STAT3. To address
this speculation, we used IL-6 to activate STAT3 in lung
cancer cells, and found that IL-6 significantly induced
phosphorylation of STAT3 and suppressed crizotinibinduced autophagy (Fig. 3C). To further address the
inhibitory function of IL-6 on autophagy is STAT3specifically, we then employed plasmids carrying
wild-type (STAT3-WT) and constitutively activated

STAT3 (STAT3-C). As shown in (Fig. 3D), comparing
to control empty plasmids, overexpression of total or
phosphorylated STAT3 significantly suppressed crizotinibinduced autophagy, reflected by the decrease of LC3
lipidation and increase of p62. Immunofluorescence
staining of LC3-II reconfirmed that upregulation of total
or phosphorylated STAT3 inhibited crizotinib-induced
autophagy, represented by a remarkable decrease of LC3
punctate staining in cells transfected with wild-type or

constitutively active STAT3 comparing to cells transfected
with control empty plasmids (Fig. S3A & S3B). Taken
together, these observations indicated that crizotinibinduced autophagy is mediated through the inhibition of
STAT3.
It has been reported that activated nuclear STAT3
could suppress autophagy by transcriptional activation
of BCL-2 family members, which are negative
regulators of autophagy.[25] A recent study has provided
convincing evidences that the main crosstalk between
STAT3 and autophagic pathways occurs in the cytosol.
Cytoplasmic STAT3 is able to sequester EIF2AK2,
which can phosphorylate EIF2A to promote autophagy.
[26] Therefore, we first examined the BCL-2 protein
level and the phosphorylation status of EIF2A and
EIF2AK2 in SPC-A1 cells after 48 hours of crizotinib
treatment (Fig. 4A), and discovered that the level of
p-EIF2A was only elevated by 1.8-fold compared with the
negative control. However, the level of p-EIF2AK2 was
decreased 0.4-fold compared with the negative control
(Fig. 4B). In accordance with the decreased p-STAT3
expression, the level of total BCL-2 was also reduced,
which indicates that, in this time period, autophagy was
mainly induced by the inhibition of BCL-2 in a STAT3
transcriptionally-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Then, we
tested the aforementioned theory once again in a shorter
time frame (Fig. 4C). This time, it was revealed that the
level of p-EIF2AK2 as well as that of p-EIF2A were
both significantly increased by 2.5- fold after 2 hours of
exposure to crizotinib (Fig. 4D), while the level of BCL-2
was unchanged (Fig. 4C). Then, again we attempted to
confirm these observations in SPC-A1, A549 and HCC827
cells in an intermediate time frame, which is 15 hours
of treatment exposure based on the literature [26]; we
obtained similar results. It seemed that the phosphorylation
of EIF2A and the downregulation of BCL-2 were both
responsible for the induction of autophagy at this time
point (Fig. 4E & 4F).
Taken together, these results demonstrated that
crizotinib might induce autophagy in targeted lung cancer
cells through the inhibition of the STAT3 pathway in a
step-wise manner. This would occur first by the inhibition
of cytoplasmic STAT3, which leads to the phosphorylation
of EIF2A, then by the inhibition of nuclear STAT3, which
leads to the downregulation of BCL-2.

PIK3C3 that blocks autophagy at the initial stage, and
CQ, a lysosomotropic agent, which blocks the fusion of
autophagosomes with lysosomes and inhibits autophagy
at a later stage [28]. As expected, the addition of either
3-MA or CQ sensitized the growth inhibition induced
by crizotinib in SPC-A1 and A549 cells (Fig. 5A & 5B).
Correspondingly, they were also able to augment the
crizotinib-induced apoptosis of SPC-A1 cells (Fig. 5C).
To exclude the potential off-target pharmacological
effects of drugs that inhibit autophagy, we treated the cells
with small hairpin RNAs against Beclin-1, an essential
component for the formation of autophagosomes. As
shown in Fig. 5D&E, shRNA against Beclin-1 could
efficiently knock down its target gene; it then blocked
crizotinib-induced autophagy in SPC-A1 cells as well
as in A549 cells. Similar to the action of autophagy
inhibitors, shRNA against Beclin-1 significantly enhanced
the cytotoxicity of crizotinib in SPC-A1 cells via the
inhibition of cell survival and the promotion of apoptosis
(Fig. 5D, 5E & 5F).
Generally, these data demonstrated that crizotinibinduced autophagy is cytoprotective. Inhibition of
autophagy could enhance the growth inhibitory effect
of crizotinib, at least partially, through the promotion of
apoptosis in targeted lung cancer cells.

Inhibition of autophagy enhances the anti-tumor
effect of crizotinib in vivo
To further determine the therapeutic benefit of the
inhibition of autophagy in combination with crizotinib, we
used a SPC-A1 xenograft model. When the tumors were
measurable, the mice were randomly assigned to receive
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), crizotinib or a combination of
HCQ and crizotinib. As shown in Fig. 6A-6C, HCQ alone
had no significant effect on the growth of tumors, and
crizotinib alone displayed moderate anti-tumor activity in
that it reduced the tumor weight by 40.4%. In contrast,
a combination of HCQ with crizotinib further reduced
the tumor weight by 20.1% compared with crizotinib
alone (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, no significant weight loss
or hepatic toxicity was observed with the combination
treatments (Fig. S4A & S4B).
We then investigated the effect of crizotinib
on autophagic pathways in xenografted tumors. As
shown in Fig. 6D & 6E, tumors that were treated with
crizotinib displayed an accumulation of LC3-II. In
addition, the expression of LC3-II was much higher in
the crizotinib-treated group than in the vehicle-treated
group. In parallel to the increase in LC3-II, a drastic
degradation of the autophagy substrate p62 in tumor
tissues was observed after crizotinib treatment. (Fig. 6F).
An immunohistochemical analysis re-confirmed that the
inhibition of autophagy promoted apoptosis, as reflected
by positive immunostaining for cleaved-caspase-3 (Fig.

Inhibition of autophagy potentiates the antitumor effects of crizotinib in vitro
Considering that autophagy may function as a
stress-activated pro-survival mechanism in cancer cells
[27], we hypothesized that the inhibition of autophagy
could sensitize targeted lung cancer cells to crizotinib
treatment. Two autophagy inhibitors were employed to
test the feasibility of this theory: 3-MA, an inhibitor of

6G & 6H). We further noticed that cell proliferation
was also downregulated in tumor samples as reflected
by PCNA staining (Fig. S5), which is probably due to
the inhibition of proliferative pathways such as MET
signaling. Consistent with the in vitro results, crizotinib
induced autophagy through the inhibition of expression
of p-Met, p-AKT, p-STAT3 and its downstream effector
BCL-2. (Fig. 6I-6K).
Taken together, these findings suggest that crizotinib
induces autophagy in targeted lung cancer cells in vivo
through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the STAT3
signaling pathway. Inhibition of autophagy by HCQ can
also potently enhance the anti-tumor activity of crizotinib
in vivo.

However, we did notice that the induction of autophagyrelated markers was far less significant by MET-specific
inhibition via siRNA compared with crizotinib treatment.
This observation lead us to verify MET expression and
downstream signaling in 5 other lung cancer cell lines
including A549, H1975, Calu-3, HCC827 and H1650
following crizotinib treatment. Intriguingly, although
the expression levels of total MET varied in these cell
lines, the baseline level of MET phosphorylation was
only detectable in A549 and HCC827 cells, but not in
H1975, Calu-3 or H1650 cells. However, in the 3 cell
lines (A549, H1975 and HCC827) that autophagy was
induced, the downregulation of p-STAT3 was the only
factor in common, while the change of p-MET, p-AKT,
p-MTOR, or p-ERK was inconsistant (Fig. 3B). These
findings lead us to focus our effort in the determination of
the relationship between crizotinib-induced autophagy and
the STAT3 pathway.
In research done by Ji et al.[11], crizotinib induces
autophagy in EML4-ALK positive H3122 cells through
ALK-dependent downregulation of AKT-MTOR pathway.
Whether the treatment alter the STAT3 pathway or
not was not mentioned in the original study. However,
in our effort to find the common signaling pathway
involved in crizotinib treatment, the STAT3 pathway
was quite outstanding in all the lung cancer cell lines
tested (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we have also examined the
phosphorylation status after crizotinib treatment in H2228
cells, a confirmed EML4-ALK positive lung cancer cell
line,[8] and discovered the phosphorylation level of STAT3
was downregulated as well (Fig. S6). Thus we speculate
that inhibition of AKT-MTOR pathway was probably not
the main factor in crizotinib-induced autophagy, but the
STAT3 pathway. IL-6, plasmids carrying wild-type and
constitutively activated STAT3 were then employed to
confirm the involvement of STAT3 in crizotinib-induced
autophagy. As shown in Fig. 3C & 3D and Fig. S3,
activation of STAT3 by IL6, or overexpression of total or
phosphorylated STAT3 significantly suppressed crizotinibinduced autophagy in lung cancer cells.
Intriguingly, we also examined the upstream
molecules of STAT3 and discovered that none of JAK1,
JAK2 and SRC participated in crizotinib mediated STAT3
inhibition in SPC-A1 cells (Fig. S7), which indicates
a possible direct inhibition of STAT3 by crizotinib.
Nevertheless, this hypothesis remains debatable before
further investigation. Moreover, the crizotinib-induced
STAT3 inhibition was supported by the research of
Hamedani et al.[29], which showed that crizotinib
induces apoptosis through the downregulation of STAT3
phosphorylation in NPM-ALK positive anaplastic large
cell lymphoma. However genetic inhibition of ALK
was not employed in the original work. Therefore, the
result of the study should be interpreted with caution,
since the downregulation of p-STAT3 could either be
the consequence of ALK inhibition or direct crizotinib

DISCUSSION
In this study, we explored whether crizotinib is
able to induce autophagy in the targeted cell lines, and
discovered that the treatment induced autophagy in the
sensitive SPC-A1 cells, as well as in the resistant A549
cells (Fig. 1B, 1C & 1D). Crizotinib treatment can also
induce the same effect in EML4-ALK-positive H2228
cells (Fig. S1). This observation is consistent with the
result of Ji et al’s.[11] We observed lipidation of LC3 and
degradation of p62 in lung cancer cells after exposure to
crizotinib (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence also showed
that the endogenous LC3 punctate staining was increased
in crizotinib-treated cells (Fig. 1C). A classic autophagy
detection method, TEM, also showed that autophagosomes
were significantly increased in cells that were treated with
crizotinib (Fig. 2). These results provided strong evidence
that crizotinib activates autophagy in treated lung cancer
cells.
MET amplification is present in approximately
4% of lung cancer patients and is related to the acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibition as well as ALK inhibition.
[2, 3, 5] Aberrant MET activation in cancer is considered
a driver oncogene in a subgroup of lung adenocarcinomas.
[8, 9] MET is a classic member of the RTK superfamily,
which mediates the activation RAS-ERK-MAPK, PI3KAKT-MTOR and STAT3 pathways, all of which are
closely related to autophagy induction.[7, 24] In this study,
we first found that the phosphorylation of MET, AKT,
MTOR and STAT3 was significantly inhibited in SPC-A1
cells (Fig. 3A). In order to confirm that the induction of
autophagy by crizotinib in lung cancer cells was the result
of MET inhibition, we used small-interference RNA to
specifically target MET, and revealed that knockdown
of MET mRNA resulted in the downregulation of MET
expression. Therefore, we observed the transition of LC3-I
to LC3-II as well as the degradation of p62. Moreover, a
marked increase in LC3-II puncta that were colocalized
with lysosomes was observed after siMET treatment in
SPC-A1 cells. The addition of HGF could reverse the
crizotinib-induced punctate LC3 expression (Fig. S2).

inhibition.
Studies have shown that STAT3 not only suppresses
autophagy via the transcriptional regulation of autophagyrelated genes such as BCL-2,[25] but also by the
sequestering of cytoplasmic EIF2AK2, which prevents
the phosphorylation of EIF2A.[26] Thus, we examined
that protein level of BCL-2 as well as the phosphorylation
of EIF2AK2 and EIF2A in SPC-A1 cells after 48 hours
of crizotinib treatment. As expected, the level of BCL2 protein was significantly decreased, while EIF2A was
increased after treatment with crizotinib; however, the
level of p-EIF2AK2 was not increased as presumed, but
rather, it was decreased (Fig. 4A & 4B). After referred
to the original article by Shen et al, [26] we found that
the observation of upregulated phosphorylation of
EIF2A and EIF2AK2 was not made in the same time
frame, but was recorded after 2 hours and 15 hours of
autophagy induction, respectively. Therefore, we tested
the expression levels of these 2 proteins after 2 hours or
15 hours of crizotinib treatment and obtained very distinct
results. After 2 hours of treatment, the phosphorylation
of both EIF2AK2 and EIF2A was upregulated, while
the level of BCL-2 was unchanged (Fig. 4C & 4D). We
also noticed that the phosphorylation of MTOR was
not decreased in this time-frame. This suggests that the
induction of autophagy as evidenced by LC3 transition
after 2 hours of crizotinib treatment was not likely due
to the transcriptional downregulation of BCL-2 by
nuclear STAT3 or loss of MTOR inhibition, but was
the outcome of cytoplasmic STAT3 inhibition. We
confirmed this hypothesis once again in SPC-A1, A549
and HCC827 cells after 15 hours of crizotinib treatment
and obtained similar data (Fig. 4E & 4F). This indicates
that the increased phosphorylation of EIF2A caused by
cytoplasmic STAT3 inhibition as well as by decreased
BCL-2, which is mediated by nuclear STAT3 inhibition,
might both contribute to the induction of autophagy
but that they occur in different time intervals in these
lung cancer cell lines. Another interesting observation
was also made, in that p-EIF2AK2 was downregulated
following prolonged induction of autophagy. This was
probably due to post-translational protein modification
in the late stage of autophagy flux or severe autophagy
degradation, but has not been reported before. This might
indicate that p-EIF2AK2 was somehow integrated with
or interacted with the autophagosome constructed protein
complexes. However, this hypothesis still requires further
investigation.
Autophagy has become a potential target for cancer
therapy.[15] A number of studies have demonstrated that
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and antibodies, such as
linifanib, [30] imatinib, [31, 32] sorafenib, [18, 33, 34]
pazopanib, [35, 36] sunitinib, [36, 37] and cetuximab,
[19, 38] among others, can activate autophagy in cancer
cells. Our previous study reported that the EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib activate autophagy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in human lung cancer cells.[22] Induction of autophagy
in response to these TKIs could be cytoprotective or
cytodestructive, which contributes to the anticancer
efficacy of these drugs as well as to drug resistance. In
our study, we have demonstrated that the inhibition
of autophagy sensitizes targeted lung cancer cells to
crizotinib treatment in vitro and in vivo. However, the
systemic suppression of autophagy might introduce
another problem since the inhibition of autophagy
increased the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in
normal cells. Autophagy in normal cells represents a
defense mechanism, and reports have demonstrated
that the activation of autophagy protects hepatocytes
against chemical-induced hepatotoxicity.[39] Takahashi
and colleagues observed that kidney injury was more
significant in autophagy-deficient mice compared with
wild-type mice after cisplatin administration.[40] Another
study also indicated that autophagy was cytoprotective
during cisplatin injury of renal proximal tubular cells.[41]
In our lung cancer xenograft models, we did observe an
insignificant but noticeable decrease in body weight in
mice treated with HCQ plus crizotinib (Fig. S4A). There
was also a report showed that 50 mg/kg crizotinib daily
plus 50 mg/kg erlotinib daily could result in severe toxicity
in nude mice xenograft models.[42] Thus, it is not clear
whether liver injury or chronic kidney injury would occur
after crizotinib plus HCQ treatment because the exposure
time in this study was relatively short. Therefore, in future
studies, we propose a more targeted delivery system in
order to increase the benefit of the combined effect of
crizotinib and autophagy inhibition.
In summary, we conclude that crizotinib can
activate autophagy in lung cancer cells through a STAT3dependent mechanism in a step-wise manner. In the early
stage of crizotinib-induced autophagy, cytoplasmic STAT3
inhibition leads to the phosphorylation of EIF2A, which
subsequently induces autophagy. In the later stage of
crizotinib-induced autophagy, nuclear STAT3 inhibition
leads to the downregulation of BCL-2, which subsequently
facilitates a prolonged autophagic response. The inhibition
of autophagy by pharmacological or genetic approaches
sensitizes targeted lung cancer cells to crizotinib, at least
partially, through the promotion of crizotinib-induced
apoptosis. Autophagy inhibition represents a promising
approach to circumvent intrinsic or acquired resistance to
crizotinib in targeted lung cancer cells. Thus, crizotinib
combined with autophagy inhibitors could have clinical
value in the future.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

at 60 kV.

Immunofluorescence

Reagents and antibodies

The cells, which were seeded at 5 × 105 into sixwell plates, were treated with the designated dose
of chemicals for 48 h, and were then incubated with
Lyso Tracker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 60
min. After this, the cells were washed twice with PBS,
followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilization with 1% CHAPS buffer (150 mM NaCl,
10 mM HEPES, 1.0% CHAPS) at room temperature for
15 min. Hereafter, the cells were incubated with antiLC3 (Sigma-Aldrich, L7543) for 2 h at 37 °C and with
FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. Next,
the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for
15 min. The samples were examined under a Zeiss LSM
710 fluorescence microscope system (Carl Zeiss Inc,
Oberkochen, Germany). Images were processed with ZEN
LE software. For quantification of LC3-positive cells, 150200 cells were randomly selected from the acquired image
and were counted. The cells with more than five dots of
specific green or orange signals were considered to be
LC3-positive.

The chemicals used in this study were crizotinib
(Selleck Chemicals LLC, Houston, TX, USA), chloroquine
(CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (J&K chemical Ltd,
Beijing, China) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (SigmaAldrich Corporation, St Louis, MO, USA). The primary
antibodies used were against microtubule-associated
protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3), p62, Beclin-1, total or
phospho-STAT3, AKT, MTOR, ERK, MET, EIF2AK2
and EIF2A and were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Boston, MA, USA). The secondary antibodies were
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG (Cell
Signaling Technology) and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (Beyotime, Nanjing, China).

Cell lines and animals
Cells were purchased from the cell bank of the
Chinese Academy of Science. The cells were maintained in
DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Crizotinib was dissolved
in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) and was further diluted
with medium before use so that the final concentration of
DMSO was under 0.1%. Female athymic BALB/c nude
mice (Shanghai Institute of Material Medicine, Chinese
Academy of Science, China) were maintained in a specific
pathogen-free facility and were treated with humane care
after approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee
of Zhejiang University.

RNA interference, plasmids and transfections
Cells were transfected with scrambled or siRNA
against MET using Hiperfect (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For MET RNA interference,
two siRNA oligonucleotides that target MET were
purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). A
nonspecific oligo that is not complementary to any
human genes was used as a negative control. The short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence that targets Beclin-1
CGACUUGUUCCUUACGGAA was cloned into the
pL/shRNA/GFP/F vector purchased from Novobiosci
(Shanghai, China). The cells were transduced with pL/
shRNA/GFP/F-BECN1 and with vector controls before
selection by flow cytometry 24 h later. Then, the cells were
maintained in 10 μg/ml blasticidin-containing medium
before they were subjected to analysis.
Wild-type STAT3 (pcDNA5/FRT/TO/STAT3-WT),
constitutively activated STAT3 (pcDNA3.1/STAT3-C)
and their control empty plasmids were kindly provided
by Prof. Yu Hua (City of Hope National Medical Center,
CA, USA). Cells were transfected with plasmids by
Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. 48 hours after transfection,
the cells were treated with crizotinib and then subjected
to analysis.

Proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was determined by MTS assay.
The cells were seeded into 96-well plates and were
treated with crizotinib, CQ, 3-MA or a combination of
these compounds. After treatment, 10 μl MTS (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) was added to each well prior to a
2-h incubation. The absorbance was measured in a model
ELX800 Micro Plate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc,
Winooski, VT, USA) at 490 nm; the proliferation was then
calculated.

Transmission electron microscopy
The treated cells were washed and fixed for 30 min
in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The samples were then treated
with 1.5% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with acetone
and embedded in Durcupan resin. Thin sections were
poststained with lead citrate and examined in a TECNAI
10 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands)

Apoptosis assay

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The cell apoptotic rate was determined by flow
cytometric analysis with the fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (KeyGEN
Biotech, Nanjing, China). Cells were collected by
trypsinization, washed twice and resuspended in 1 ×
binding buffer at a concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells/ml. Then,
100 μl of cells was mixed with 5 μl of FITC Annexin V
and 5 μl PI, and incubated for 15 min. The samples were
then sent for analysis by flow cytometry. The results were
analyzed with the BD FACSCalibur™ system.

To establish SPC-A1 tumors, 5 × 106 cells were
inoculated s.c. in the flank region of 5- to 6-week-old
female athymic BALB/c nude mice. When the diameter
of the subcutaneous tumors reached approximately
0.5 centimeter, tumor-bearing animals were randomly
assigned to either the vehicle, the crizotinib alone, the
HCQ alone or the crizotinib + HCQ group. Crizotinib
was suspended in 30% polyethylene glycol, 0.5%Tween
80 and 5% propylene glycol, and administered by oral
gavage at the dose of 25 mg/kg/day. HCQ was dissolved
in 0.9% NaCl and was administered intraperitoneally
daily at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The tumor volume
was calculated using the formula V = LW2/2, where L
is the largest diameter and W is the smallest diameter.
Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last treatment.
The tumors were weighed and subjected to western blot
analysis or paraffin embedding. Immunohistochemistry
was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
4-μm-thick sections of tumor samples using adequate
primary antibodies. Images were visualized with a Zeiss
LSM 710 fluorescence microscope system (Carl Zeiss
Inc). Images were processed with ZEN LE software.
