Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are appealing cellular pharmaceuticals for cancer therapy because of their innate ability to
recognize and kill tumor cells. Therefore, the development
of methods that can enhance the potency in their anticancer effect would be desirable. We have previously shown
that a murine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF)/interleukin 2 (IL-2) fusion protein displays
novel antitumor properties in vivo compared with both cytokines in combination due to recruitment of NK cells. In
the present work, we have found that human ortholog of
the GM-CSF/IL-2 fusion protein (a.k.a. hGIFT2) induces robust NK cell activation ex vivo with significant secretion of
RANTES and a 37-fold increase in IFNγ production when
compared with either IL-2 or GM-CSF single cytokine treatment or their combination. Moreover, hGIFT2 upregulates
the expression of NK cell activating receptors NKp44,
NKp46, and DNAM-1 (CD226), as well as CD69, CD107a,
and IL-2Rβ expression. In addition, hGIFT2 promotes NK
cell maturation, based on the downregulation of CD117 expression and upregulation of CD11b. This phenotype correlates with significantly greater cytotoxicity against tumor
cells. At the molecular level, hGIFT2 leads to a potent activation of Janus-activated kinases (JAK) downstream of both
IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors (JAK1 and JAK2, respectively)
and consequently leads to a hyperphosphorylation of signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3,
and STAT5. In conclusion, hGIFT2 fusokine possesses
unique biochemical properties distinct from IL-2 and GMCSF, constitutes a novel and potent tool for ex vivo NK cell
activation and maturation, and may be of use for cancer
cell immunotherapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):9020–8]

Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector cells that react
against virus-infected or transformed cells before the onset of
adaptive immunity. These cells express an array of inhibitory
and activating receptors that sense the quality and quantity
of self-MHC class I molecules expressed at the cell surface,
which mediate the recognition of target cells and regulate

the activation state of NK cells. Upon cytokine stimulation, NK
cells become lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells that proliferate, produce cytokines [IFNγ and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) α], and upregulate effector molecules such as adhesion
molecules, perforin, granzymes, Fas ligand, and TRAIL. These
features endow NK cells with the ability to kill tumor cells
and act as essential promoters of an adaptive immunity against
tumor challenge (1). Indeed, several in vitro as well as in vivo
studies indicate that tumor cells are recognized as NK cell targets. NK cells not only directly eliminate tumor cells, but also
induce the subsequent development of tumor-specific T-cell responses to parental tumor cells. For example, the potential of
NK cell–based therapy has been evoked in patients suffering of
acute myeloid leukemia. In this case, adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells with mismatched NK inhibitory receptors and
HLA class I ligands produce graft-versus-leukemia in the absence of graft-versus-host disease due to the ability of donor
NK cells to attack recipient dendritic cells, which are responsible for priming donor T cells and induce graft-versus-host disease (2). Therefore, clinical interest in NK cells as a cancer cell
pharmaceutical is rapidly growing, with >200 clinical trials examining either autologous or allogeneic NK cells as well as universal donor NK cell lines. However, there are some theoretical
limitations to the use of NK cells for cancer therapy. Tumor
cells expressing low levels of MHC class I may fail to trigger
NK cell activation (3). NK cells from patients affected by advanced bulky malignancies display impaired cytolytic activity,
which can be attributed to tumor-derived suppressive factors
such as transforming growth factor β that exert deleterious effects of NK cell effector functions (4). Therefore, the infusion of
primed and activated NK cells would be an approach that may
enhance the effectiveness of these cells in the treatment of
cancer. The use of cytokines and combinations thereof would
be an obvious method to activate NK cells ex vivo. Better still,
pharmacologic activation of NK cells in a manner unachievable
with native cytokines may lead to desirable acquired anticancer
properties. In this line of thought, we have previously shown
that a murine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interleukin-2 (IL-2) fusion protein (a.k.a. GIFT2)
displays novel antitumor properties in vivo compared with both
cytokines in combination regarding to tumor site recruitment
of significant functional NK cell infiltration (5). In the present
study, we show that the human ortholog of the GM-CSF/IL-2
fusion protein (hGIFT2) induces potent human NK cell activation and cytotoxicity distinct from that achieved by IL-2 or
GM-CSF. The use of hGIFT2 as a means to generate oncolytic
NK cells may serve an enhanced cellular platform for cancer
cell therapy.

cells were cultured in DMEM (Wisent Technologies) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Wisent Technologies). The cell lines TF-1,
CTLL-2, Daudi, K562, and U266 [American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC)] were grown according to ATCC's recommendations. Recombinant proteins (hIL-2 and hGM-CSF, R&D Systems); anti α-tubulin (Santa

for flow cytometry (BD Biosciences); and ELISA kits for human IL-2 and
GM-CSF (Invitrogen and eBioscience), and for RANTES, IFNγ, and TNFα
(R&D systems). Cytotoxicity detection kit lactate dehydrogenase (LDH;
Roche Applied Science).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human NK cells. Blood was
drawn from healthy donors, after informed consent had been obtained, into
heparin- or citrate-coated CPT tubes (BD Biosciences), and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density centrifugation
according to the manufacturer's recommendation. NK cells were obtained
by negative purification using the untouched NK cells isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were treated with NK cell biotin-antibody cocktail and
magnetic microbeads reagents and were depleted by magnetic cell sorting
system with an autoMACS column (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NK cell population (CD56+CD3−) purity assessed by

flow cytometry was 96% (Supplementary Data S1). Three different donors
were used for each experiment and an average of two different experiments
was performed with the same donor.
Vector construct and transgene expression. The human GM-CSF
cDNA (Invivogen) was modified to remove the 3′ nucleotides encoding
the stop codon and subsequently cloned in frame with the cDNA encoding the human IL-2 devoid of start codon to generate the cDNA for
hGIFT2 fusokine. The hGIFT2 was incorporated into a bicistronic vector
(pCMV), allowing the expression of both hGIFT2 and green fluorescent
protein (6). The nucleotide sequence of the hGIFT2 cDNA was confirmed
by DNA sequencing at the Guelph Molecular Supercenter. Concentrated
media conditioned by 293 T cells stably transfected with pCMV encoding for hGIFT2 was used to test the bioactivity of hGIFT2. The IL-2–
responsive CTLL-2 or GM-CSF–responsive TF-1 cell lines were plated at a
density of 105 cells per well in a 96-well plate and treated with increasing
concentration of cytokines for 48 h. Cell proliferation was assessed with a
MTT assay.
Analysis of cell surface marker on leukocytes. PBMC were cultured
with hGIFT2 and equimolar concentrations of cytokine controls (IL-2, GMCSF, and IL-2 combined with GM-CSF, 2 pmol). After 7 d in culture, the
cells were resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS and incubated with anti-human
FcR III/II for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were labeled with a mixture of
conjugated antibodies specific for cell surface markers (CD3, CD4, CD8,
CD56, and their respective isotype controls) for 1 h at 4°C and analyzed
by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACScan.

of cytokine for 7 d were resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS, incubated with
anti-human FcR III/II for 30 min, and labeled with conjugated antibodies
specific for NK cell activating receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D,
CD226), inhibitory receptors (CD43, KIR), maturation markers (CD11b,
CD117), NK cell activation markers (CD69, CD107a), and IL-2 receptor
components (α subunit CD25, β subunit CD122, and γ subunit CD132).
The expression of these cell surface markers was determined by FACS Calibur cytometer (BD) and analyzed using Cellquest software (BD). For IFNγ
intracellular staining, NK cells previously stimulated with cytokines for 2
h were treated with Brefeldin A for 4 h, were fixed, were permeabilized,
and were stained with IFNγ-conjugated antibody. For Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, NK cells cultured with cytokines (2 pmol) for 7 d
were incubated with Annexin V/propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed by flow cytometry. For carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester staining, NK cells prestained with CFSE were cultured with
cytokines for 4 d, and cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry.
The data were analyzed using Cellquest software (Becton & Dickinson).
In vitro cytotoxicity assay. NK cells (1 × 105; effector cells) previously
stimulated with hGIFT2 or cytokine controls for 3 d were washed twice and
cocultured with 1 × 104 target cells (Daudi, K562, U266) at an effector/
target cell ratio of 10:1 for 4 h. Supernatants were collected and used to
measure the LDH released from the cytosol of damaged or lysed cells using
a cytotoxicity detection LDH kit. As controls, we measured the spontaneous LDH released from target and effector cells. The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated according to the formula:

as part of hGIFT2 was confirmed by proliferation of GM-CSF–
dependent cell line, TF-1 (Fig. 2A), and IL-2–dependent cell line,
CTLL-2 (Fig. 2B). The proliferation level of each cell line was
determined by MTT incorporation for the last 4 hours of incubation with cytokines. As result, hGIFT2 induces similar proliferation levels of these cell lines compared with equimolar
concentration of each cytokine controls, which indicate that
both GM-CSF and IL-2 as part of the fusion preserve the ability
to induce an appropriate proliferative response.
Effect of hGIFT2 on primary lymphocytes. The effect of
hGIFT2 on lymphocytes was determined by culturing PBMCs
with equimolar concentrations of cytokines (2 pmol). After 7
days in culture, we observed that hGIFT2 promotes a significant
increase in the number of NK cells compared with equimolar
concentration of cytokine controls, whereas the number of
CD8, CD4, and NKT cells did not show significant differences with
each cytokine treatment (Fig. 3A). Similarly, we observed a significant increase of NK cell percentage in the hGIFT2-treated PBMC
fraction from three different donors (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we investigated whether hGIFT2 induces NK cell proliferation
or enhances NK cell survival. To test these hypotheses, purified
NK cells were prestained with CFSE, cultured with equimolar

cytotoxicity (%) = (Experimental - Effector Spontaneous)/
(Target Maximum - Target Spontaneous) × 100

Target Maximum: maximum LDH released from Triton X-100–treated
target cells.
Intracellular signaling. For signaling analysis, media conditioned by
stably transfected 293 T cells expressing hGIFT2, as well as media conditioned by nontransfected cells containing equimolar concentration of cytokine controls (IL-2, GM-CSF, or IL-2 combined with GM-CSF, 5 pmol each),
were added to 106 NK cells for 20 min before being lysed and probed by
Western blot with rabbit anti-phosphorylated Jak1, Jak2, Stat1, Stat3 and
Stat5, ERK, and Akt antibodies. Antibodies against total proteins were used
as loading controls as well as anti–α-tubulin antibody. Three independent
experiments were performed with NK cells from different donors.
Statistic evaluation. P values were calculated by paired Student's t test.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Design and expression of hGIFT2 fusokine. The human
GMCSF/IL-2 (hGIFT2) construct was created by cloning a modified
human GM-CSF cDNA missing the nucleotides encoding for the
stop codon in frame with the 5′ end of the human IL-2 cDNA devoid of its start codon. The final fusokine hGIFT2 cDNA encodes
for a single polypeptide chain of 302 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Denaturing immunoblotting performed on the supernatant of 293T cells
stably transfected to express hGIFT2 (5 ng per million cells in 24 h)
showed that the chimeric protein was secreted and has an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). We detected and quantified hGIFT2 by IL-2 and
GM-CSF ELISA and we found that 1 pmol (45 ng) of hGIFT2 is
equivalent to 97 units, whereas 1 pmol (15 ng) of recombinant
IL-2 is equivalent to 221 units (Fig. 1C). Both techniques confirm
that only the full-length hGIFT2 fusokine of predicted molecular
weight is secreted by transfected cells.

Figure 3. hGIFT2 increases NK survival but does not induce NK cell proliferation: PBMC or NK cells were cultured with 2 pmol of hGIFT2 or equimolar concentrations
of cytokine controls (IL-2, GM-CSF, or both IL-2 and GM-CSF combined, 2 pmol each). A, PBMC cultured with cytokines for 7 d were labeled with conjugated
antibodies specific for cell surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD56, and cell type number was quantified by flow cytometry. B, the percentage of NK cells from three

indicated for each figure. D, NK cells cultured with cytokines for 7 d were staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide, and the percentage of apoptotic cells in each

concentrations of cytokines, and analyzed by flow cytometry. After
4 days in culture, IL-2 as well as IL-2 combined with GM-CSF induces NK cell proliferation (Fig. 3C). However, after 7 days in culture with cytokine controls the NK cell number decreased, although
the media was changed at day 4 to avoid cell starvation. In contrast,
hGIFT2 does not induce NK cell proliferation but rather protect NK
cells from apoptosis (Fig. 3C and D). Based on these results and in
agreement with previous reports (7, 8), we suggest that IL-2–activated NK cells undergo apoptosis in long term culture.
hGIFT2 induces activation of NK cells. Purified human NK
cells pretreated with hGIFT2 displayed an enhanced activation
profile compared with NK cells stimulated with equimolar concentration of cytokine controls, based on the expression levels of
the early activation marker (CD69) and a marker of degranulation (CD107a; Fig. 4A). To evaluate the responsiveness of NK
cells to hGIFT2, we analyzed the expression levels of the IL-2
trimeric receptor subunits (α, β, γ). IL-2Rα and IL-2Rγ expression levels were not modified by any cytokine treatment (data
not shown), whereas IL-2Rβ expression was upregulated by
hGIFT2 and downregulated by GM-CSF (Fig. 4A). Intracellular
staining for IFNγ indicates that hGIFT2 induces a robust expres-

sion of IFNγ in the first 6 hours of cytokine treatment (Fig. 4B,
left). By ELISA, we quantified that hGIFT2 promotes >37-fold
greater IFNγ production than equimolar concentration of IL-2
after 3 days in culture (Fig. 4B, right), as well as significant secretion of RANTES (Fig. 4C, bottom). However, we did not detect
significant differences regarding TNFα production (Fig. 4C, top).
We also observed that GM-CSF inhibits NK cell–derived IFNγ,
TNFα, and RANTES production. These results indicate that
hGIFT2 displays superior properties as a tool for NK cell activation and overcomes GM-CSF–mediated immunosuppression. In
addition, hGIFT2 similarly affect both CD56bright and CD56dim
subsets of NK cells, which upon hGIFT2 stimulation become
highly activated and granulated (Supplementary Data S2).
hGIFT2 upregulates activating receptor expression and
promotes NK cell maturation and significant greater NK cell
cytotoxicity. Spontaneous cytotoxic activity is mainly triggered
by the activating receptors natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR;
NKp30, NKp44, NKp46), NKG2D, and leukocyte adhesion molecule DNAX accessory molecule 1 [DNAM-1 (CD226); refs. 1, 3].
hGIFT2-stimulated NK cells upregulate NKp44, NKp46, and DNAM1 (CD226) expression (Fig. 5A) but not NKG2D (Supplementary

Data S3A) and NKp30 (data not shown) expression. In addition,
hGIFT2 downregulates the expression of the receptor for stem
cell factor c-kit (CD117) and upregulates the expression of integrin CD11b (macrophage antigen-1; Fig. 5B). hGIFT2 downregulates the expression of the inhibitory receptor CD43 and does
not alter the expression level of the inhibitory receptors KIR
(Supplementary Data S3B and C). This phenotype indicates that
hGIFT2-stimulated NK cells undergo a maturation process,
which correlated with significant greater cytotoxicity than cytokine controls against both NK-resistant Daudi cells and NKsensitive K562 and U266 tumor cells. As previously reported
(9), we also observed that GM-CSF significantly suppresses NK
cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 5C). After 7 days in culture with cytokines,
a 30% decline of cytotoxicity was observed in hGIFT2-stimulated
NK cells, and a 60% reduction of killing ability in IL-2–stimulated
NK cells (Supplementary Data S4).
hGIFT2 induces hyperactivation of Jak/signal transducers
and activators of transcription signaling pathway in NK cells.
NK cells express components of both IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors
(10). The intracellular signaling of IL-2R occurs through the β chain
[JAK1/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3]
and the γ chain (JAK3/STAT5), whereas the GM-CSF receptor sig-

nals through its β chain (JAK2/STAT5). To decipher the molecular
mechanism underpinning the effect of hGIFT2 on NK cells, we analyzed the activation status of JAK kinases and STAT transcription
factors downstream of IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors, respectively.
We observed that hGIFT2 induces robust hyperphosphorylation of
JAK1 and JAK2, and this is associated with greater activation of
STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 when compared with controls. In contrast, GM-CSF completely abrogates STAT5 phosphorylation and inhibits IL-2–mediated STAT5 activation (Fig. 6A and B). We also
measured the activation status of other signaling pathways downstream of IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors, such as MKK/ERK and
AKT pathways (11, 12). AKT pathway was more activated by hGIFT2
than cytokine controls (Fig. 6D), which supports the observation
that hGIFT2 enhances NK survival. In contrast, the activation status
of NF-κB and MKK/ERK did not show significant differences in
hGIFT2-stimulated NK cells compared with equimolar concentrations of cytokine controls (data not shown).

the treatment of cancer is controversial. A phase II clinical study

unresectable renal carcinoma fails to manifest the synergistic therapeutic effect of these two cytokines (13). Indeed, patients receiving GM-CSF and IL-2 treatment display an impaired LAK activity
compared with IL-2 alone, and specifically, GM-CSF has been
shown to downregulate certain aspects of innate immune response
such as NK cell cytotoxicity (14). In the present study, we have
shown that hGIFT2 displays unheralded novel properties that overcome GM-CSF–mediated NK cell suppression and promotes potent NK cell activation. hGIFT2 upregulates the expression of the
early activation marker CD69 and promotes greater NK cell degranulation based on acquired surface expression of LAMP-1
(CD107a). The potent immune stimulatory effects of hGIFT2 on
NK cells are evidenced by a substantial upregulation of NK activat-

ing receptors NKp44 and NKp46. The human triggering receptors
responsible for NK cell cytotoxicity include the NCRs and NKG2D.
NCRs belong to the Ig superfamily and include NKp46 and NKp30,
which are expressed by both resting and activated NK cells, and
NKp44, which is expressed only by activated NK cells (15–17). Although the cellular ligands on tumor cells for NCRs are currently
unknown, NCRs have been identified as crucial receptors for target
cell recognition and induction of NK cell cytotoxicity toward a
wide range of cancer cells. Substantial evidence indicates that
there is a direct correlation between NCR surface densities and
the ability of NK cells to kill different tumor target cells (18).

adhesion and signaling. This activating receptor recognizes PVR
(CD155) and Nectin-2 (CD112), two members of the lectin family
that are highly expressed on carcinomas, melanomas, and some
hematopoietic cell lines (19, 20). Consequently, hGIFT2-stimulated
NK promote significant cytotoxic activity against all target tumor
cells analyzed. Interestingly, hGIFT2-treated NK cells were able to
lyse “NK-resistant” Daudi cells (Burkitt's lymphoma). These tumor
cells are negative for MHC class I expression, but expresses MHC
class II, which correlates with the increase resistant to NK-mediated
lysis (21). As expected, hGIFT2-stimulated NK cells also promote
greater cell lysis of NK-sensitive K562 and U266 cell lines. K562
leukemia cells (chronic myelogenous leukemia) are negative for
both MHC class I and II expression, whereas U266 cells (myeloma),
although are sensitive to NK-mediated cell cytotoxicity, express high
levels of MHC class I (22), which supports “the missing self” hypothesis that NK cells kill certain targets because they fail to express
adequate levels of MHC gene products.
NK cells stimulated with IL-2 for 7 days display a remarkable
reduction of cytotoxicity activity against myeloma cells. According to previous reports that IL-2 induces NK cells apoptosis in
long-term culture (7, 8), we suggest that the reduction of NK
cell cytotoxicity over time is due to a decrease of IL-2–stimulated
NK viability. On the other hand, hGIFT2 does not induce NK

cell proliferation compared with equimolar concentration of IL2, but rather protects NK cells from apoptosis, which result in
a net increase of NK cell number over time. In addition, hGIFT2
prompts NK cells to secrete substantial amounts of IFNγ (37fold greater than equimolar concentrations of IL-2) as well as
RANTES. The extremely high production of IFNγ may restrain
the proliferation of NK cells and at the same time prevent NK
cell apoptosis, since IFNγ has been reported to induce cell cycle
arrest in several cell types (23). In LAK cells, IFNγ in synergy
with IL-2 acts as inhibitor for LAK cell proliferation but not differentiation (24). We also found that distinct from IL-2, hGIFT2
induces a NK cell maturation process characterized by the
downregulation of the expression of the receptor for stem cell
factor c-kit (CD117), which is expressed by NK cell precursors
but is largely diminished on matured NK cells (25, 26). CD11b
integrin upregulation constitute another marker of NK cell maturation (27). As molecular mechanisms underpinning hGIFT2 effect on effector cells, hGIFT2 not only upregulates IL-2Rβ
(CD122) expression but also induces a hyperactivation of JAK1
and JAK2 kinases associated to β chains of both IL-2 and
GM-CSF receptors, which lead to a robust phosphorylation of
STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 transcription factors. By comparing
the levels of STAT5 phosphorylation in hGIFT2-stimulated NK

Figure 6. hGIFT2 induces a hyperactivation of
JAK/STAT pathway downstream of GM-CSF and IL-2
receptors in NK cells. NK cells (5 × 106) were
stimulated for 20 min with 5 pmols of cytokines, and
cell lysates were probed for (A) phosphorylated
JAK1, JAK2, and their respective anti–full-length
protein antibodies. B, phosphorylated STAT1,
STAT3, and STAT5, as well as total STAT1, STAT3,
and STAT5 antibodies. C, phosphorylated AKT
and total AKT antibody. Antibodies anti–full-length
proteins and α-tubulin were used as loading
controls. Absorbance quantifications of immunoblots
are shown in each figure. These results are
representative of three independent experiments
performed with NK cells from three healthy
volunteers.

NK Activation with hGIFT2 Fusokine

cells with equimolar concentration of GM-CSF, we observed that
hGIFT2 overcomes GM-CSF–mediated suppressive signals on NK
cells. These results suggest that hGIFT2 has higher avidity for
NK cells than single cytokine control maybe due to a bivalent
binding of hGIFT2 to both receptors expressed on NK cells. Interestingly, hGIFT2 fusokine promotes greater activation of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt in NK cells. Activated Akt in turn
phosphorylates a number of downstream target genes that prevent apoptosis and promote cell survival, which could be the
mechanism used by hGIFT2 to protect NK cell from apoptosis
and to enhance survival.
Several clinical trials using ex vivo IL-2–expanded and activated
autologous NK cells have shown apparent limited effectiveness in
the therapy of cancer, including melanoma, renal carcinoma, lung
carcinoma, ovarian, and brain cancer (28). The infusion of high
doses of IL-2 not only is associated with severe toxic side effects,
but also sensitizes NK cells to apoptosis when they are in contact
with the vascular endothelium, which may cause a decrease of NK
cell migration to the tumor (29, 30). Interestingly, allogeneic NK
cells characterized by a KIR/KIR-ligand incompatibility display
more cytotoxicity against solid tumors and leukemia (31, 32).
Remarkably, patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with alloreactive NK cells benefit from higher rates of engraftment, survival, and reduced incidence of GvHD (33). The risk of GvHD is a
consequence of the inefficient priming of alloreactive donor T cells
consequent to NK cell–mediated killing of recipient antigenpresenting cells (34). However, alloreactive NK cells arising from
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation require several weeks to
mature posttransplantation, which may contribute to leukemia relapse (35). Therefore, we may speculate that the infusion of mature
NK cells would more effectively prevent leukemic relapse, promote
engraftment by eliminating patient lympho-hematopoietic cells,

and reduce GvHD by lysing patient antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, biochemical NK priming that enhances their survival, effector
function, and maturation would be desirable in the setting of cancer cell immunotherapy—features afforded by NK cell treatment
with hGIFT2.
In summary, NK cells are the only lymphoid cells that express
components of both IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors (10). Therefore,
the selective effect of hGIFT2 on NK cells suggest that hGIFT2
binds to these cytokine receptors in an atypical fashion, which triggers aberrant signals downstream of both IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors, leading to the hyperphosphorylation of receptor-associated
JAK/STAT proteins. Consequently, hyperactivated NK cells produce large amount of IFNγ and RANTES and overexpress NCRs
involved in NK cell cytotoxicity while contemporaneously acquiring features of mature and apoptosis-resistant cells. The use of
GIFT2-primed autologous NK cells may therefore be of interest
in cell therapy of cancer.
