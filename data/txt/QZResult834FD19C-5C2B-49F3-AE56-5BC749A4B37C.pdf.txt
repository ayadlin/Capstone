ABSTRACT
The molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-breast cancer effects of
polyphyllin I, a natural compound extracted from Paris polyphylla rhizomes, are
not fully understood. In the present study, we found that polyphyllin I induces
mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 by dephosphorylating DRP1 at Ser637, leading
to mitochondrial fission, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol and,
ultimately apoptosis. Polyphyllin I also increased the stabilization of full-length PINK1
at the mitochondrial surface, leading to the recruitment of PARK2, P62, ubiquitin, and
LC3B-II to mitochondria and culminating in mitophagy. PINK1 knockdown markedly
suppressed polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and enhanced polyphyllin I-induced,
DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression
of DRP1 by mdivi-1 or shRNA inhibited PINK1 knockdown/polyphyllin I-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, suggesting that PINK1 depletion leads
to excessive fission and, subsequently, mitochondrial fragmentation. An in vivo study
confirmed that polyphyllin I greatly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis
in MDA-MB-231 xenografts, and these effects were enhanced by PINK1 knockdown.
These data describe the mechanism by which PINK1 contributes to polyphyllin
I-induced mitophagy and apoptosis and suggest that polyphyllin I may be an effective
drug for breast cancer treatment.

Furthermore, mitochondrial damage depletes ATP and
releases cytochrome c (Cyto C), which leads to the
activation of caspases and, eventually, apoptosis [5].
The timely elimination of damaged mitochondria is
therefore essential for maintaining the health of the cell.
Mitophagy also plays an important role in the regulation
of the tumor microenvironment and cancer cell death
and survival, and studies of the molecular mechanisms
underlying mitophagy in cancer will be crucial in
developing novel therapies [6].

INTRODUCTION
Autophagy is a cellular process in which
organelles and proteins are sequestered into autophagic
vesicles that are subsequently degraded through
fusion with lysosomes [1]. Mitochondrial autophagy
(hereafter referred to as mitophagy) is an important
cellular pathway that facilitates the removal of damaged
mitochondria [2, 3]. Mitochondria are very susceptible
to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage [4].

Mitophagy is regulated by the PINK1/PARK2
pathway. PARK2 is a RING domain-containing E3
ubiquitin ligase that can be activated through autoubiquitination [7]. When mitochondria are depolarized
using mitochondrial uncoupling reagents such as CCCP
(carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), PARK2
translocates to mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial
degradation [8]. Furthermore, overexpression of PARK2
induces the degradation of depolarized mitochondria via
mitophagy [9]. Because PARK2 also selectively binds
only to damaged mitochondria, it might help to ensure the
specificity of mitophagy [10].
PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), which contains a
mitochondrial targeting sequence and is localized at the
mitochondria [11]. PINK1 protects against neurotoxininduced mitochondrial injury, while disease-associated
PINK1 mutations or loss of PINK1 function result in
ROS-mediated mitochondrial injury [12]. Only full-length
PINK1 expression promotes autophagy or CCCP-mediated
mitophagy [13]. Under stress conditions, mitochondrial
membrane depolarization prevents mitochondrial uptake
and processing of PINK1; the resulting accumulation of
unprocessed PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane
recruits PARK2 and subsequently leads to elimination
of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy [8]. PINK1
also regulates apoptosis and cell growth in breast cancer
cells [14]. Because PINK1 regulates cancer cell survival,
stress resistance, mitochondrial homeostasis, and cell
cycle progression, it may serve as a therapeutic target
or a predictive biomarker of response to treatment in
cancer patients [15]. Inhibition of the fusion–fission cycle
using the DRP1 inhibitor mdivi-1 prevents mitophagy,
demonstrating the importance of mitochondrial fission in
mitophagy [16]. DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission
induces LC3B lipidation and mitophagy, which requires
PARK2 and PINK1 [17]. A recent study indicated that
LC3B-II autophagosomes, which target mitochondrial
membranes by interacting with C18-ceramide–LC3B-II,
promote lethal mitophagy and suppress tumor growth [18].
An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms
by which DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission affects
mitophagy might help to identify potential drug targets
for the treatment of various human cancers.
Polyphyllin I, a major steroidal saponin in extracts
from Paris polyphylla rhizomes, has a wide range of
biological activities against many types of cancers,
including cervical, lung, ovarian, and gastric cancers, as
well as osteosarcoma [19–24]. Polyphyllin I increases
the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells
to cisplatin [25]. Polyphyllin I also induces caspasedependent apoptosis and activates autophagy via the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma
HepG2 and SMCC7721 cells, and blockade of autophagy
enhanced polyphyllin I-induced anti-proliferation effects
[26]. Polyphyllin D (the same molecular structure
as polyphyllin I) also induces apoptosis in human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells via the
mitochondrial pathway [27] and in drug-resistant HepG2
cells via mitochondrial fragmentation [28]. However, the
exact mechanism by which polyphyllin I exerts anti-cancer
effects in human breast cancer cells remains unclear.
In this study, we demonstrated for the first time
that polyphyllin I induces apoptosis and mitophagy
through DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Notably,
polyphyllin I treatment resulted in the accumulation
of full-length PINK1 at the mitochondrial surface,
which recruited PARK2 to the mitochondria and
ultimately culminated in mitophagy. Polyphyllin I
also induced mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 by
dephosphorylating DRP1 at Ser637, which increased
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. shRNA-induced
PINK1 knockdown combined with polyphyllin I treatment
markedly decreased mitophagy and enhanced DRP1dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Our study
provides novel insight into the mitophagic and apoptotic
effects of polyphyllin I and suggests that polyphyllin I
may be a valuable chemotherapeutic agent for the clinical
treatment of human breast cancer.

RESULTS
Polyphyllin I induces apoptosis through
mitochondrial pathways
We first evaluated the effects of polyphyllin I on
apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential in
breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells using flow cytometry.
Polyphyllin I treatment increased apoptosis and decreased
mitochondrial potential in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Figure 1A and 1B). We then investigated whether
polyphyllin I also induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast
cancer and Hs-578Bst human mammary stromal cells.
Polyphyllin I induced apoptosis similarly in MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). However,
polyphyllin I induced apoptosis to a lesser degree in Hs578Bst cells than in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). Western blot analysis revealed
that polyphyllin I dose- and time-dependently increased
cleavage/activation of CASP9 and CASP3, as well as
increased PARP cleavage (Figure 1C). These events were
also accompanied by significant increases in the release
of Cyto C from the mitochondria into the cytosol (Figure
1C). An immunofluorescence assay also confirmed that
Cyto C was released from mitochondria into the cytosol
in response to polyphyllin I treatment (Figure 1D).

Polyphyllin I induces mitochondrial fission and
mitophagy in breast cancer cells
Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial
fission promotes the initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis
[29]. We examined the effects of polyphyllin I on

mitochondrial fission by staining MDA-MB-231 cells
with the mitochondrion-selective probe Mitotracker Red
CMXRos with CCCP as a positive control. Exposure of
cells to polyphyllin I resulted in significantly increased
mitochondrial fission and markedly decreased average
mitochondria length in a time-dependent manner (Figure
2A and 2B). Similar results were observed in polyphyllin
I-treated MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B).
Since mitochondrial fission isolates damaged mitochondria
and promotes their elimination via mitophagy [30], we
next examined whether polyphyllin I affects mitophagy.
MDA-MB-231 cells transiently expressing RFP-Mito and
GFP-LC3 were fluorescent-labeled with LAMP1 (Blue),
and the colocalization of mitochondria, autophagosomes,
and lysosomes was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy.
GFP-LC3 colocalized with mitochondria and LAMP1
in polyphyllin I-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
cells (Figure 2C and 2D, Supplementary Figure 2C).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed high
electron-density substances and abnormal mitochondria
surrounded by double membranes, indicating the presence of

mitophagosomes (Figure 2E). Western blot analysis revealed
that polyphyllin I treatment increased LC3B-II levels in
both mitochondrial fractions and whole-cell lysates in a
time-dependent manner (Figure 2F, Supplementary Figures
2D and 3). Furthermore, polyphyllin I treatment decreased
mitochondrial TOMM20 and HSP60 protein levels, but did
not change levels of the ER protein GRP94, suggesting that
polyphyllin I-induced autophagy mainly targets damaged
mitochondria (Figure 2G). Taken together, these findings
indicate that polyphyllin I induces mitochondrial fission and
mitophagy in breast cancer cells.
To explore whether polyphyllin I induces autophagic
flux or inhibits autophagic degradation, we treated cells
with bafilomycin A1, a blocker of autophagosome and
lysosome fusion. Immunofluorescence microscopy
revealed that treatment with either polyphyllin I or
bafilomycin A1 modestly increased numbers of GFPLC3 puncta in MDA-MB-231 cells. Combined treatment
with polyphyllin I and bafilomycin A1 further increased
numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta (Supplementary Figure
4A and 4B). Western blots indicated that polyphyllin I

were stained using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I or rhodamine 123, apoptosis and mitochondrial (Mt) membrane potential
were detected with flow cytometry. Data are presented as mean ± SD (*P< 0.05 or **P< 0.01 vs. the control). C. Whole-cell lysates (WCL),

COX IV (mitochondrial fraction) were used as the loading controls. D. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with RFP-mito plasmids
and then exposed to PPI (8 μM) for 12 h. After immunostaining with Cyto C (Alexa Fluor 488, green), cells were examined by confocal
microscopy. Scale bars: 10 μm.

PINK1 and PARK2 are involved in polyphyllin
I-induced mitophagy

treatment modestly increased LC3B-II accumulation,
which was further increased by bafilomycin A1 treatment.
Furthermore, the polyphyllin I-induced decrease in
TOMM20 levels was largely reversed by bafilomycin
A1 treatment (Supplementary Figure 4C). These
findings suggest that polyphyllin I increased numbers of
autophagosomes by increasing autophagosome formation
rather than by inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes
with lysosomes.

PARK2 translocates to the mitochondrial surface
and ubiquitinates numerous mitochondrial proteins, which
in turn initiate mitophagy [8]. We therefore examined
the effects of polyphyllin I on levels of PARK2, P62,
and ubiquitin in mitochondria. Polyphyllin I treatment
increased mitochondrial PARK2, P62, and ubiquitin levels

Figure 2: Polyphyllin I induces mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. A. MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to 8 μM PPI for

different periods of time as indicated or treated with 20 μM CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) for 9 h. Mitochondria were

(Figure 3A). An immunofluorescence assay revealed that
PARK2 colocalized with mitochondria (RFP-Mito), P62,
and ubiquitin in polyphyllin I-treated cells (Figure 3B).
PARK2 also colocalized with LC3, the mitochondrial
marker TOMM20, and ubiquitin in polyphyllin I-treated
cells (Figure 3C). Thus, polyphyllin I treatment promotes
recruitment of PARK2 to mitochondria, leading to
the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins and
colocalization with the UB-binding proteins P62 and LC3,
and culminating in the degradation of mitochondria via
mitophagy.
Since the recruitment of PARK2 to mitochondria is
mainly dependent on PINK1, we next examined whether
polyphyllin I affects PINK1 expression. Polyphyllin
I treatment markedly increased levels of full-length
PINK1 (~63 kDa) and decreased levels of cleaved
PINK1 (~52 kDa) in a time-dependent manner (Figure
3D and 3E). Similar results were obtained in polyphyllin
I-treated MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 5). Next,
we examined the effects of polyphyllin I treatment on
the expression of the mitochondrial proteases peptidase
mitochondrial processing alpha (PMPCA) and beta
(PMPCB), presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease
(PARL), and AFG3L2 (a subunit of the m-AAA protease)
[11, 31], all of which cleave PINK1. Polyphyllin I
treatment decreased PMPCB and PARL levels, but did
not alter PMPCA or AFG3L2 levels (Figure 3F). These
results suggest that polyphyllin I induces the accumulation
of full-length PINK1 by inhibiting the mitochondrial
proteases PMPCB and PARL.
We then conducted an immunoprecipitation assay to
investigate whether PARK2 binds to PINK1 in polyphyllin
I-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Interactions between
PARK2 and PINK1 increased in polyphyllin I-treated cells
(Figure 3G). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
that PARK2 colocalized with PINK1 in the mitochondria
after polyphyllin I treatment (Figure 3H). Taken together,
these findings indicate that polyphyllin I induces the
accumulation of full-length PINK1 at the mitochondrial
surface by inhibiting the mitochondrial proteases PMPCB
and PARL, in turn increasing PARK2 recruitment and
mitophagy.

in mitochondrial PARK2, P62, LC3B-II, and ubiquitin
levels in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Figure 4C,
Supplementary Figure 6A-6C). An immunofluorescence
assay revealed that PINK1 knockdown markedly reduced
the polyphyllin I-induced colocalization of GFP-LC3
with mitochondria and LAMP1 (Figure 4D and 4E,
Supplementary Figure 6D).
We then evaluated the effects of PINK1 knockdown
on mitochondrial morphology. PINK1 knockdown
increased
polyphyllin
I-induced
mitochondrial
fragmentation compared to shCon cells (Figure 4F
and 4G, Supplementary Figure 7A and 7B). Because
cytoplasmic DRP1 translocates to mitochondria and
mediates mitochondrial fission [32], we next investigated
whether PINK1 knockdown affects mitochondrial
recruitment of DRP1 in response to polyphyllin I
treatment. Western blots indicated that PINK1 knockdown
markedly increased levels of DRP1 at mitochondria after
polyphyllin I treatment compared to shCon cells (Figure
4H, Supplementary Figure 7C).
Because mitochondrial fragmentation is associated
with increases in apoptosis and increased mitochondrial
fission parallels the release of Cyto C from the mitochondria
into the cytosol in apoptotic cells [33], we next examined
the effects of PINK1 knockdown on apoptosis and Cyto C
release in polyphyllin I-treated cells. PINK1 knockdown
increased polyphyllin I-induced apoptosis, PARP
cleavage, CASP9 and CASP3 activation, and Cyto C
release (Figure 4I-4K, Supplementary Figure 7D and 7E).
Taken together, these findings indicate that polyphyllin I
induces mitophagy and DRP1-dependent mitochondrial
fragmentation and apoptosis. Furthermore, PINK1
knockdown suppressed mitophagy and increased polyphyllin
I-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis.

Suppression of DRP1 inhibits PINK1
knockdown-induced mitochondrial
fragmentation and apoptosis after polyphyllin I
treatment
Because
PINK1
knockdown
increased
mitochondrial fragmentation, we next investigated
whether mitochondrial dynamics were perturbed by the
loss of PINK1 function. Pretreatment with mdivi-1, a
pharmacological inhibitor of DRP1, markedly inhibited
the recruitment of DRP1 to mitochondria in both shCon
and shPINK1 cells after polyphyllin I treatment (Figure
5A). Pretreatment with mdivi-1 also attenuated polyphyllin
I-induced mitochondrial LC3B-II and PARK2 levels in
both shCon and shPINK1 cells (Figure 5A). Moreover,
mdivi-1 pretreatment blocked polyphyllin I-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation in these cells (Figure 5B and
5C). Finally, mdivi-1 pretreatment attenuated polyphyllin
I-induced apoptosis, PARP cleavage, and CASP9 and
CASP3 activation in both shCon and shPINK1 cells
(Figure 5D and 5E).

Polyphyllin I induced, and PINK1 knockdown
further increased, DRP1-dependent
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis
It has been shown that PINK1 silencing increases
hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in breast cancer
cells [14]. Whether PINK1 knockdown could also
sensitizes breast cancer cells to polyphyllin I, we used
shRNA to stably knock down PINK1 expression (Figure
4A). PINK1 knockdown largely blocked polyphyllin
I-induced reductions in mitochondrial TOMM20 and
HSP60 protein levels (Figure 4B). Moreover, PINK1
knockdown decreased the polyphyllin I-induced increases

To exclude nonspecific effects of mdivi-1, we used
a lentivirus shRNA approach to stably knock down DRP1
expression (Figure 5F). DRP1 knockdown markedly
reduced polyphyllin I-induced increases in mitochondrial
DRP1, PARK2, and LC3B-II levels in both shCon and
shPINK1 cells (Figure 5G). DRP1 knockdown also
markedly decreased polyphyllin I-induced mitochondrial
fragmentation, apoptosis, PARP cleavage, and CASP9
and CASP3 activation in both shCon and shPINK1
cells (Figure 5H-5K). These results indicate that PINK1
knockdown in combination with polyphyllin I treatment
increases mitochondrial fragmentation due to excessive
fission.

of FK506 further decreased, while H89 markedly
increased, polyphyllin I-induced mitochondrial LC3BII and PARK2 levels in shPINK1 cells (Figure 6D).
Fluorescent microscopy revealed that FK506 decreased,
while H89 increased, the colocalization of GFP-LC3 with
mitochondria in polyphyllin I-treated shCon cells (Figure
6E and 6F). Compared to shCon cells, PINK1 knockdown
decreased polyphyllin I-induced colocalization of GFPLC3 with mitochondria. FK506 further decreased, while
H89 increased, the polyphyllin I-induced colocalization
of GFP-LC3 with mitochondria in shPINK1 cells (Figure
6E and 6F).
Moreover, FK506 blocked, and H89 increased,
mitochondrial fragmentation in polyphyllin I-treated cells
(Figure 6E-6G). Taken together, these findings suggest that
knockdown of PINK1 enhances polyphyllin I-mediated
dephosphorylation of DRP1 (Ser637) through promotion
of CaN activity and suppression of PKA activity, leading
to inhibition of mitophagy and induction of mitochondrial
fragmentation.

PINK1 knockdown promotes mitochondrial
fragmentation and suppresses mitophagy by
dephosphorylating DRP1 (Ser637)
Dephosphorylation at Ser637 or phosphorylation at
Ser616 both promote the translocation of DRP1 from the
cytosol to mitochondria and increase mitochondrial fission
[29]. We next examined the effects of PINK1 knockdown
on DRP1 phosphorylation at Ser637 and Ser616 in
polyphyllin I-treated cells. Western blot analysis revealed
that PINK1 knockdown markedly increased polyphyllin
I-induced dephosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser637 (Figure
6A). In contrast, polyphyllin I treatment alone or in
combination with PINK1 knockdown did not alter DRP1
phosphorylation at Ser616 (Figure 6A).
DRP1 dephosphorylation at Ser637, which is
due to the activity of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase
calcineurin (CaN), promotes mitochondrial fission, and
protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated DRP1 phosphorylation
at Ser637 causes mitochondrial elongation [34]. We
therefore examined the effects of the CaN blocker FK506
and the PKA inhibitor H89 in cells with or without PINK1
knockdown. PINK1 knockdown markedly increased
polyphyllin I-induced CaN activity, and pretreatment with
FK506 largely blocked polyphyllin I-induced increases in
CaN activity in both shCon and shPINK1 cells (Figure
6B). In addition, PINK1 knockdown markedly increased
polyphyllin I-induced inhibition of PKA activity, and
pretreatment with H89 increased polyphyllin I-induced
inhibition of PKA activity in both shCon and shPINK1
cells (Figure 6C). Moreover, FK506 attenuated, while H89
enhanced, the polyphyllin I-mediated dephosphorylation
of DRP1 at Ser637 and its translocation to mitochondria
in both shCon and shPINK1 cells (Figure 6D).
Next, we investigated the effects of FK506 and
H89 on polyphyllin I-induced changes in mitophagy
and mitochondrial morphology in both shCon and
shPINK1 cells. FK506 decreased, while H89 increased,
polyphyllin I-induced increases in mitochondrial LC3BII and PARK2 levels (Figure 6D). PINK1 knockdown
markedly decreased polyphyllin I-induced increases in
mitochondrial LC3B-II and PARK2 levels; the addition

growth was enhanced by PINK1 knockdown in a

To determine whether our in vitro findings could be
replicated in vivo, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing
control shRNA or PINK1 shRNA were xenografted
into immunodeficient nude mice, which then received
intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or polyphyllin
I for 45 days. Tumor volumes were lower in mice with
shPINK1 xenografts that were treated with polyphyllin I
than in shCon xenograft mice treated with polyphyllin I
(Figure 7A and 7B). Body weights did not differ among
any of the groups of mice (Figure 7C), nor did other signs
of potential toxicity, such as agitation, impaired movement
and posture, and indigestion or diarrhea.
To determine whether PINK1 knockdown promotes
polyphyllin I-induced apoptosis, hemotoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL), and immunohistochemical analysis were
performed. H&E staining of tumor sections from shPINK1
xenograft mice treated with polyphyllin I revealed changes
in morphology, as indicated by signs of necrosis with
infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibrosis, compared
to shCon xenograft mice treated with polyphyllin I
(Figure 7D). Additionally, polyphyllin I treatment
dramatically increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells
and cleaved CASP3 immunoreactivity, which is indicative
of apoptosis, in tumors from shPINK1 xenograft mice
compared to shCon mice (Figure 7D).
We then used western blots to confirm that PINK1
knockdown enhanced polyphyllin I-induced apoptosis
by promoting mitochondrial translocation of DRP1
and suppression of mitophagy. PINK1 knockdown
dramatically increased DRP1 levels in mitochondrial

7E). Taken together, these findings indicate that

that PINK1 knockdown enhances the antitumor activity

defense mechanism to protect against harm resulting from
damaged mitochondria. This mechanism involves selective
degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy
[36]. Here, we show for the first time that polyphyllin I
induced apoptosis and mitophagy in breast cancer cells.
This polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy was characterized
by the accumulation of LC3B-II in mitochondrial
fractions, colocalization of GFP-LC3 with mitochondria
and LAMP1, and downregulation of the mitochondrial
proteins TOMM20 and HSP60. We demonstrated that
mitophagy is an early response to polyphyllin I-induced
mitochondrial injury that may help to efficiently eliminate
unwanted or damaged mitochondria and re-establish
mitochondrial homeostasis.
Mitophagy is regulated by the PINK1/PARK2
pathway. PINK1 and PARK2 cooperate to promote
selective degradation of damaged mitochondria via
mitophagy [37]. PINK1 recruits PARK2 from the

DISCUSSION
Mitochondria, which are commonly referred to as the
power center of the cell, are involved in many biochemical
functions, ranging from energy production to programmed
cell death [5]. Damaged mitochondria undergo fission
during apoptosis [35]; however, cells have developed a

cytoplasm to damaged mitochondria and subsequently
promotes autophagy of the damaged mitochondria [13].
The chemotherapy drug doxorubicin increases PINK1 and
PARK2 expression in the cerebral cortex [38]. In addition,
overexpression of full-length PINK1 promotes mitophagy
in the CCCP model [13]. In contrast, PINK1 knockdown
suppresses mitophagy and promotes mitochondrial
fragmentation and apoptosis [17]. Inhibition of autophagy
enhanced polyphyllin I induced-apoptosis in human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells [26]. The following results
from this study strongly suggest that PINK1 plays an
important role in the regulation of polyphyllin I-induced
mitochondrial fission and mitophagy: (i) polyphyllin
I induced the accumulation of full-length PINK1 by
inhibiting the mitochondrial proteases PMPCB and PARL;
(ii) PINK1 knockdown markedly decreased polyphyllin
I-induced accumulation of mitochondrial LC3B-II
and attenuated polyphyllin I-induced colocalization of
GFP-LC3 with mitochondria and LAMP1; (iii) PINK1
knockdown largely blocked the polyphyllin I-induced
reduction in levels of the mitochondrial proteins TOMM20

and HSP60; (iv) PINK1 knockdown increased polyphyllin
I-induced mitochondrial fragmentation.
Mechanistically, we found that PINK1 contributes
to polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy by recruiting PARK2
to the mitochondria. Polyphyllin I dramatically increased
mitochondrial PARK2, P62, and ubiquitin levels in a
time-dependent manner. In addition, PARK2 colocalized
with mitochondria, P62, and ubiquitin, and with LC3,
mitochondria, and ubiquitin in breast cancer cells after
polyphyllin I treatment. Immunoprecipitation assays and
immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that PARK2
and PINK1 interacted with each other and colocalized in
the mitochondria in response to polyphyllin I treatment.
Furthermore, PINK1 knockdown markedly decreased
polyphyllin I-induced increases in mitochondrial PARK2,
P62, LC3, and ubiquitin levels. These results suggest
that polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy requires functional
PINK1, which recruits PARK2 to the mitochondria and, in
turn, ubiquitinates numerous mitochondrial proteins and
recruits the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding adaptor protein
P62 to mitochondria.

Figure 8: A proposed model for polyphyllin I-induced mitophagic and apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells.

Polyphyllin I induced mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 by dephosphorylating DRP1 at Ser637, which lead to mitochondrial fission and
cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytosol, in turn activating caspases and promoting apoptosis. Meanwhile, polyphyllin
I also increased stabilization of full-length PINK1 at the mitochondrial surface, leading to recruitment of PARK2, P62, ubiquitin, and
LC3B-II to the mitochondria and culminating in mitophagy. Moreover, PINK1 knockdown markedly suppressed mitophagy and enhanced
polyphyllin I-induced, DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.

Mitochondria undergo frequent fission and fusion
events that regulate their morphology. DRP1, a largely
cytosolic member of the dynamin GTPase family, is
a crucial regulator of mitochondrial fission [39], and
disrupting mitochondrial fission with dominant-negative
DRP1 prevents mitophagy [40]. In addition, PINK1
overexpression dramatically decreases mitochondrial
DRP1 levels, while PINK1 knockdown markedly
increases the translocation of DRP1 from the cytosol to
mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial fragmentation
[41, 42]. Several lines of evidence presented here
indicate that PINK1 knockdown increases mitochondrial
fragments was due to increased mitochondrial fragments
generated rather than decreased the clearance by
mitophagy. First, combined treatment with polyphyllin
I and bafilomycin A1 revealed that polyphyllin I is an
autophagic flux inducer. Second, PINK1 knockdown
increased the polyphyllin I-induced translocation of DRP1
from the cytosol to mitochondria, but did not change
levels of DRP1 in whole-cell lysates. Third, PINK1
knockdown dramatically increased polyphyllin I-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial apoptosis.
Fourth, pretreatment with the DRP1 inhibitor mdivi-1 or
DRP1 knockdown largely blocked polyphyllin I-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation in PINK1-deficient cells.
Phosphorylation of different DRP1 serine residues
regulates mitochondrial dynamics in various physiological
and pathological processes, including mitosis, oxidative
stress, nutrient starvation, and voltage-dependent calcium
channel signaling [43]. Phosphorylation of the human brain
DRP1 isoform (isoform 1) at serine 637 by protein kinase
A inhibits mitochondrial division, while dephosphorylation
of this residue by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
phosphatase calcineurin promotes mitochondrial fission
[44]. Consistent with this report, our results strongly
support that the loss of PINK1 activates dephosphorylation
of DRP1 at serine 637, leading to mitochondrial
fragmentation. First, PINK1 knockdown increased
polyphyllin I-induced dephosphorylation of DRP1 at serine
637. Second, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 inhibited,
while the PKA inhibitor H89 dramatically enhanced,
polyphyllin I-induced dephosphorylation and mitochondrial
translocation of DRP1 in PINK1-deficient cells. Third,
FK506 decreased and H89 dramatically increased
polyphyllin I-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and
mitophagy in PINK1-deficient cells. Taken together,
these findings suggest that PINK1 knockdown suppresses
mitophagy and promotes mitochondrial fragmentation by
dephosphorylating DRP1 at serine 637.
PINK1 has important pro-survival, anti-apoptotic,
and cytoprotective functions, suggesting that it may be a
promising target for cancer therapies [15]. PINK1 deletion
reduces, and PINK1 overexpression restores, cancer cell
proliferation, colony formation, and invasiveness, indicating
that PINK1 promotes cell cycle progression and acts as an
oncogene [45]. Moreover, deletion of PINK1 sensitizes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, as well as other cell lines,
to mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic death stimuli [14,
46]. Consistent with these reports, our results revealed
that PINK1 knockdown in combination with polyphyllin
I treatment suppressed mitophagy and promoted DRP1dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis, suggesting
that PINK1 might be an important therapeutic target of
polyphyllin 1-based breast cancer treatments.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that mitophagy
promotes cellular survival during the polyphyllin
I-induced preapoptotic lag phase, leading to delayed
mitochondrial apoptosis. Polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy
suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis, while PINK1
knockdown-induced inhibition of mitophagy accelerated
DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation, leading
to mitochondrial apoptosis in response to polyphyllin I
treatment (Figure 8). Our study describes a mechanism
by which PINK1 mediates the complex balance between
polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and mitochondrial
fission-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our
findings suggest that polyphyllin I might be an effective
novel agent for breast cancer treatment.

for 2 h, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Epon.
Ultra-thin sections were prepared using a microtome
(UC7, Leica, Germany) and stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate. Sections were examined under a Tecnai 10
transmission electron microscope (Philips, Netherlands).

Apoptosis was evaluated using the Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences,
556547) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was monitored
using Rhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes, R-22420). Briefly,
cells were incubated with 5 μM Rhodamine 123 for 10 min
at 37°C, washed with PBS, and subsequently analyzed by
flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded on coverslips and cultured in 24well plates for 24 h, followed by transfection with GFPUB (11928) and RFP-LC3 (21075) (Addgene, USA) or
RFP-mito and GFP-LC3 (GeneChem, Biotechnology,
Shanghai, China) plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000
(Invitrogen, L3000015) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated
with different drugs for the indicated amounts of time,
and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and
blocked with 10% FBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated
with various primary antibodies at 4°C overnight,
followed by incubation with the following secondary
antibodies at 37°C for 1 h, as appropriate: Alexa Fluor
488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, A11001), Alexa
Fluor 405 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, A-31553),
or Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes,
A31573). Cells were visualized using a laser-scanning
confocal microscope (LSM780NLO, Zeiss, Germany) or
a confocal microscope with a live cell imaging chamber
(DMI 6000B, Leica, Germany). Mitochondrial length and
percentage of cells in which mitophagy occurred were
determined blindly using randomized filenames (Filename
randomizer, CodeUnit, Craig Lotter) and Zeiss LSM
Image Examiner software.

Western blots and immunoprecipitation
Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated
using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells
(Pierce, 89874) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
For total protein extraction, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
(Beyotime, China, P0013B). Total protein concentration
was detected using the Enhanced BCA Protein Assay
Reagent (Beyotime, China, P0010), and equal amounts of
each sample were boiled with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer
for 10 min, separated on 8% - 14% SDS-PAGE gels, and
transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, 162-0177).
After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk, the blots were
incubated with the appropriate antibodies and bands were
visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (BioRad, 170-5061). For immunoprecipitation, equal quantities
of proteins were incubated with PINK1 antibody at 4°C for
12 h followed by incubation with protein A/G agarose beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2003) for 3 h, after which
immune complexes were collected by centrifugation. After
washing 5 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), samples
were subjected to western blot analysis. Densitometric
analysis of the blots was performed using Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad, Germany).

Calcineurin activity assay
The calcineurin activity assay was performed using
the Calcineurin Cellular Activity Assay Kit (Calbiochem,
207007) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cell extracts were desalted using a resin
chromatography column to remove excess phosphate and
nucleotides, and 5 μL of extract was then added to each
well of a 96-well plate containing 10 μL phosphopeptide
substrate (1.64 mg/mL) with or without 25 μL 2× EGTA
buffer. The plate was incubated at 30°C for 30 min,
followed by an additional 30 min incubation with 100
μL GREEN™ reagent at room temperature. Absorbance
was read at 620 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad,
Germany). Calcineurin activity was calculated according
to the formula (ACalcineurin = ATotal- AEGTA) and normalized to
the control group.

Plasmids and establishment of stable cell lines
Human PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 shRNA
(shPINK1) plasmid (SHCLND-NM_032409), DRP1
shRNA (shDRP1) plasmid (SHCLND-NM_ 012062)
and pLKO.1-puro Non-Target shRNA Control (shCon)
Plasmid (SHC016-1EA) were purchased from Sigma.
293FT cells were co-transfected with lentiviral packaging
vectors pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG (Invitrogen, K4975)
along with shPINK1, shDRP1, or shCon plasmid using
Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, L3000015) according
to the manufacturer’s protocols. 48 h later, supernatant
containing the lentivirus was harvested and infected MDAMB-231 cells. Cells were subsequently selected with 5 μg/

China). Cells stably expressing shCon or shPINK1
(1×107) were mixed with Matrigel (1:1, BD Biosciences,
354234) and injected subcutaneously into the mammary
fat pads of nude mice. Mice were randomized into four
groups (n = 40, 10 mice per group). Polyphyllin I (5
mg/kg) or an equal volume of vehicle was administered
daily by intraperitoneal injection starting 7 days after
tumor inoculation. Tumor growth and body weights were
measured every week, and tumor volume was calculated
as (length ×width2)/2. After 45 days of treatment, mice
were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tumor
tissues were harvested and fixed in formalin or frozen at
-80°C. Histological, TUNEL, and immunohistochemical
analysis were performed as previously described [47].
Representative tumor tissues from each group were lysed
and subjected to western blot analysis.
