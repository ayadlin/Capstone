Abstract
Metastatic colorectal cancer remains largely incurable, although in a subset of patients, survival is
prolonged by new targeting agents such as anti-EGF receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies. This disease is
believed to be supported by a subpopulation of stem-like cells termed colon cancer–initiating cell (CCIC),
which may also confer therapeutic resistance. However, how CCICs respond to EGFR inhibition has not been
fully characterized. To explore this question, we systematically generated CCICs through spheroid cultures of
patient-derived xenografts of metastatic colorectal cancer. These cultures, termed "xenospheres," were
capable of long-term self-propagation in vitro and phenocopied the original patient tumors in vivo, thus
operationally deﬁning CCICs. Xenosphere CCICs retained the genetic determinants for EGFR therapeutic
response in vitro and in xenografts; like the original tumors, xenospheres harboring a mutated KRAS gene
were resistant to EGFR therapy, whereas those harboring wild-type RAS pathway genes (RASwt) were
sensitive. Notably, the effects of EGFR inhibition in sensitive CCICs could be counteracted by cytokines
secreted by cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts. In particular, we found that the MET receptor ligand hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) was especially active in supporting in vitro CCIC proliferation and resistance to EGFR
inhibition. Ectopic production of human HGF in CCIC xenografts rendered the xenografts susceptible to MET
inhibition, which sensitized the response to EGFR therapy. By showing that RASwt CCICs rely on both EGFR
and MET signaling, our results offer a strong preclinical proof-of-concept for concurrent targeting of these
two pathways in the clinical setting. Cancer Res; 74(6); 1857–69. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The survival outcome of patients with colorectal cancer at
metastatic stage is improving, thanks to the agents such as
antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab) targeting the EGF
receptor (EGFR). However, these tumors are often intrinsically
refractory and those that are sensitive almost invariably
relapse, mainly due to concomitant genetic alterations that
confer EGFR-independent proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1).
Such alterations include mutations of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF,
as well as ampliﬁcation of HER2 and MET (2–5).
A still elusive, but potentially crucial cause of treatment
failure is the survival of the so-called "cancer stem cells."

Increasing evidence shows that colorectal cancer—as well as
other tumors—contains such cells, more appropriately deﬁned
as cancer-initiating cells (CIC), to emphasize their distinctive
operational property of driving clonal expansion in xenotransplantation assays (6, 7). Consistently, CICs retain long-term
self-renewal ability in vitro, and restore, in vitro and in vivo, a
cell hierarchy including both CICs and cells devoid of tumorigenic and self-renewal properties (non–CIC).
Accumulating data indicate that, whereas non–CICs are
usually sensitive, CICs are inherently resistant to radiochemotherapy, owing to still poorly understood mechanisms that
include efﬁcient DNA repair and self-sustained protection
from apoptosis (8–12). The molecular basis of CIC resistance
to targeted therapies is even less characterized because of the
lack of models that integrate CIC genetic features with therapeutic responses.
Besides cell-autonomous genetic factors or functional traits
typical of CICs, the tumor microenvironment contributes to
resistance against targeted therapies as well (reviewed in
ref. 13); indeed, stromal-derived growth factors can circumvent
the proliferative blockade imposed by agents targeting receptor tyrosine kinases or their downstream transducers (14–16).
The microenvironment could also promote therapeutic resistance at the CIC level, by providing factors that may exacerbate
intrinsic drug refractoriness, and/or sustain distinctive
CIC properties such as long-term self-renewal.

Luraghi et al.

To unveil the mechanisms underlying sensitivity or resistance of colon CICs (CCIC) to targeting agents, we generated
a model that integrates characterization of CCIC genetic
lesions, biological/tumorigenic properties, and therapeutic
responses in vitro and in vivo. Taking advantage of our ample
collection of patient-derived xenografts of colorectal cancer
liver metastasis (xenopatients) molecularly annotated and
characterized for their response to EGFR inhibitors (4), we
derived and characterized a panel of CCICs (xenospheres) and
used them to generate secondary tumors in recipient mice
(spheropatients). We found that, in consistence with clinical
data, in the absence of constitutive RAS activation, CCIC
proliferation and survival rely on the EGFR pathway. However,
this dependency could be bypassed by other growth factor
receptors, mainly wild-type MET activated by a paracrine
circuit of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Consistently, inhibition of MET could empower sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy.

Materials and Methods
Xenosphere generation from xenopatients
Animal experimentation was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and the internal Ethical Committee for Animal
Experimentation. Cells dissociated from xenopatient tumors
(4) were grown in standard stem-cell medium, including basal
stem cell medium, i.e., DMEM/F-12 (Sigma), 2 mmol/L glutamine (Sigma), penicillin–streptomycin (EuroClone), N-2 (Life
Technologies-GIBCO), 0.4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 4
mg/mL heparin (Sigma), chemically deﬁned lipid concentrate
(Life Technologies-GIBCO), supplemented with human recombinant EGF (20 ng/mL; Sigma), and basic ﬁbroblast growth
factor (bFGF; 10 ng/mL; Peprotech).
Spheropatient generation and therapy
Dissociated xenosphere cells (106 cells/mL) were resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of basal stem-cell medium and
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and were subcutaneously injected
into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(NOD/SCID) female mice (Charles River Laboratories) or
human HGF knockin SCID mice. When tumors reached an
average volume of 400 mm3, mice were randomized and
treated with 20 mg/kg cetuximab (Merck) twice a week, or
50 mg/kg of JNJ-38877605 daily (17), or both agents, or vehicle.
Tumor size was measured once a week by caliper, and volume
was calculated using the formula 4/3(d/2)2D/2, where d is the
minor and D is the major tumor axis.
Fibroblast conditioned medium
Primary colorectal cancer specimens were processed as
described above and grown in adhesive dishes. Fibroblasts
were separated from epithelial cells by serial trypsinization.
MRC5 ﬁbroblasts were from the American Type Culture Collection; human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)
ﬁbroblasts were kindly provided by Robert A. Weinberg,
Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, (18). Fibroblasts were cultured to conﬂuence
and then kept for 24 hours in basal stem-cell medium. Fibroblast conditioned medium (FCM) was analyzed with the
RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array 5 (RayBiotech, Inc.).

Flow-cytometric analysis
Cells (2  105) were incubated with the following mouse
monoclonal antibodies—anti-CD133/1 (Miltenyi Biotec
GmbH), anti-MET (R&D Systems Inc.), anti-CD24, and antiCD44 (both Invitrogen)—and were analyzed in a CyAn ADP
(Dako Cytomation).
Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Cells were plated at clonal density (10 cells/mL) in basal
stem-cell medium. Growth factors, cetuximab (10 mg/mL), JNJ38877605 (0.5 mmol/L), or geﬁtinib (0.5 mmol/L) were added at
day 0. ATP production and caspase-3/7 activity were measured
using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) and Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay
(Promega), respectively, and a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega).
Western blot analysis
Immunoblottings were analyzed with the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-MET (DL21; ref. 19), goat polyclonal anti-HGF (R&D Systems), rabbit monoclonal anti-EGFR,
rabbit anti–phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/204), rabbit antiERK1/2, rabbit anti–phospho-Akt (Ser473), rabbit anti-Akt,
rabbit anti–phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), rabbit anti-S6 (all
Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti–phospho-EGFR
(Tyr1068; Abcam). Mouse monoclonal anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and anti-vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies
were used as controls of equal protein loading.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor sections were formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded,
processed according to the standard procedures, and analyzed
with the following antibodies: anti–phospho-S6 rabbit monoclonal (Ser235/236; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti–
phospho-ERK1/2 rabbit monoclonal (Thr202/204; Cell Signaling
Technology).
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical significance was evaluated using two-tailed Student t tests. P < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analysis of
HGF expression in a publicly available dataset [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE5851; ref. 20] was performed
by the Fisher exact test on data extracted from KRASwt
patients, taking the 75th percentile as threshold and comparing patients with reported progressive disease versus those
with complete/partial response and stable disease.
For more detailed methods, see Supplementary Experimental Procedures.

Results
Xenospheres retain genetic mutations of xenopatients
To obtain CCICs, xenopatient tumors were dissociated and
selected in standard stem-cell medium, thus establishing
sphere cultures, which, as previously shown, are enriched in
stem/progenitor cells (11, 21, 22). To specify their origin from
xenopatients rather than from fresh surgical specimens, these
spheres were named "xenospheres" (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Eight distinct xenosphere lineages were established from as

many xenopatients and these displayed the ability for longterm self-propagation in vitro (see below). Together with their
respective xenopatient tumors, xenospheres underwent analysis of gene alterations typically associated with colorectal
cancer resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy (KRAS, NRAS,
BRAF, and PIK3CA gene mutations; HER2 and MET gene
ampliﬁcations). Xenospheres retained the same lesions
detected in the matched xenopatients (Supplementary Table
S1), allowing grouping in two main subsets: (i) xenospheres
lacking alterations of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, HER2, or MET,
hereafter indicated as RASwt (M016, M049, M195, and
M199); and (ii) xenospheres harboring a mutated KRAS
gene—invariably at residue G12—hereafter indicated as
RASmut (M119, M126, M138, and M211). Although the efﬁciency
of xenosphere derivation was relatively low (10%–15%), the
frequency of KRAS mutation was similar in xenospheres,
xenopatients, and patients, ruling out a selection bias for this
mutation. Mutational analysis was extended to APC gene
hotspots, and, again, concordant frequency among xenospheres, xenopatients, and human patients was observed
(Supplementary Table S1).
Xenospheres generate tumors that recapitulate
morphology and therapeutic sensitivity of the
original xenopatients
To assess the tumorigenic potential of xenospheres, 105 cells
were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice to produce
"spheropatients" (100% engraftment efﬁciency; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Spheropatient tumors reproduced the same morphology as the corresponding xenopatients (Fig. 1A), and thus
as the original tumor. This conﬁrms the histogenetic and
pseudodifferentiating ability of CICs (6, 7, 23, 24) and indicates
that tumors from xenospheres properly recapitulate intra- and
intertumor heterogeneity. From spheropatients, secondary
xenospheres could be rederived, which retained the same in
vitro properties and tumorigenicity of the primary xenosphere,
namely the ability to sustain serial transplantation (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To ascertain whether the therapeutic responses of the
original tumors were retained, spheropatients were treated
with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab. Like the matched
xenopatients, RASwt spheropatients M016, M049, and M195
underwent tumor regression (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table
S2), whereas RASmut spheropatients M119, M126, and M138
experienced tumor progression similar to controls (Fig. 1B). Of
note, CCICs of spheropatient M016 (as well as the bulk of the
corresponding xenopatient) exhibited a PIK3CA exon 20 mutation (Supplementary Table S1), whose role as resistance biomarker is still debated (25). In our context, both M016 xenopatient and spheropatient responded to cetuximab with evident tumor shrinkage (4), conﬁrming their concordance.
Xenospheres display in vitro properties and markers
of CCICs
CCICs are deﬁned not only by the ability to regenerate
tumors with the same morphology (and therapeutic response)
as the original tumors, but also by the ability to self-renew in
vitro and to switch toward growth arrest and differentiation in

appropriate culture conditions (24). Accordingly, xenospheres
could be propagated in standard stem-cell medium for more
than 60 passages, without alteration of proliferative or tumorigenic potential. Conversely, when cultured in prodifferentiating conditions, xenospheres ceased to grow and died, although
RASmut survived longer than RASwt xenospheres (Supplementary Fig. S1B and data not shown).
Xenospheres were then analyzed for expression of markers
previously used to isolate and characterize CCICs, such as
CD133, CD44, and CD24 (24). Flow-cytometric analysis
revealed high and consistent CD24 expression and lower and
more heterogeneous CD44 expression (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly,
CD133 expression, previously used to prospectively isolate
CCIC from primary colorectal cancer (6, 7), was very heterogeneous within and among the remaining xenospheres. This is
not surprising, as in metastatic colorectal cancer both CD133þ
and CD133 cells display tumor-initiating ability (26).
Xenospheres were also analyzed for expression of receptors activated by ligands present in standard stem-cell
medium, including EGFR family members (EGFR, HER2,
and HER3), and FGFR2. Transcripts for the four receptors
were signiﬁcantly expressed in all xenospheres (Supplementary Fig. S1C) as was EGFR protein, albeit at variable levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Proliferation of RASwt but not RASmut xenospheres
requires exogenous growth factors
In growth curve assays, representative RASwt xenospheres
(M016 and M049) proliferated only in the presence of exogenous growth factors, that is, EGF-bFGF, whereas representative RASmut xenospheres (M126 and M138) displayed the same
proliferation rate irrespective of exogenous growth factors (Fig.
2B), even though EGF (stem-cell medium) could induce EGFR
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Similarly, after
dissociation and embedding in soft agar, RASwt cells formed
spheres only in the presence of exogenous growth factors,
whereas RASmut cells grew even in their absence (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
Next, the xenosphere proliferative response to individual EGF
or bFGF was assessed. All four RASwt xenospheres were significantly stimulated by EGF; three of them (M016, M49, and M195)
were stimulated also by bFGF alone, although less efﬁciently
than by EGF, and responded to the EGF–bFGF combination
with an additive effect (Fig. 2C). Conversely, proliferation of
RASmut xenospheres was not further increased by either EGF or
bFGF, with the (partial) exception of M119 (Fig. 2C).
Xenosphere response to EGFR inhibition hinges on RAS
mutation and on paracrine/autocrine EGF signaling
We then investigated whether cetuximab could block proliferation and induce apoptosis of CCICs in vitro. As expected,
in representative RASmut xenospheres M126 and M138, cetuximab did not affect cell viability (Fig. 3A) or apoptosis (Fig. 3B),
irrespective of the presence of growth factors. However,
although cetuximab induced a therapeutic response in
RASwt xeno- and spheropatients (see above; Fig. 1B; ref. 4), it
did not signiﬁcantly affect proliferation or apoptosis of the
corresponding RASwt xenospheres cultured in standard stem-

cell medium (Fig. 3C and D). This could be explained by the
presence of (i) an excess EGF (20 ng/mL) that likely outcompeted the effective dose of the antibody (10 mg/mL) for
binding the EGFR receptor extracellular domain (5, 27), and
(ii) bFGF (10 ng/mL) that could compensate for EGFR
inhibition in sustaining viability. We then veriﬁed that the
minimal EGF concentration required to achieve a plateau
proliferative effect in RASwt xenospheres was as low as 0.2
ng/mL (Supplementary Fig. S2A); at this EGF concentration
(and up to 2 ng/mL), cetuximab potently impaired viability
of representative RASwt xenospheres (Fig. 3E), in accordance
with the in vivo data. In dose–response experiments, we also
showed that bFGF concentrations higher than those present

in the standard stem-cell medium (at least 20 ng/mL) could
signiﬁcantly, although partly, restore viability and protect
RASwt xenospheres from apoptosis induced by cetuximab
(Fig. 3F and G).
Interestingly, when cultured without growth factors (Fig.
3C and D), RASwt xenospheres exhibited different basal
viability and apoptotic rates, as well as different sensitivity
to EGFR blockade. M016 and M199 displayed self-sustained
viability and low levels of apoptosis, but were extremely
sensitive to EGFR inhibition (Fig. 3C and D). At variance,
M049 and M195 kept in the absence of growth factors were
poorly viable and irreversibly poised to apoptosis, attitudes
that were unaffected by cetuximab (Fig. 3C and D). The

behavior of M016 and M199 was explained by EGF autocrine
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2B), which, on one side,
could sustain viability even in the absence of exogenous
growth factors, and, on the other side, likely sensitized
CCICs to EGFR inhibition. Results were supported by the
use of geﬁtinib, an alternative EGFR-speciﬁc small-molecule
inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S2C; ref. 28).

Taken together, these experiments indicate that EGFR inhibition blocked proliferation and induced apoptosis of RASwt
CCIC. The in vitro response to cetuximab was masked by the
standard experimental conditions used to grow xenospheres
(excess EGF); however, response could be restored by lowering
exogenous EGF concentration to doses sufﬁcient to fully
sustain cell proliferation and survival.

MET in Colon Cancer–Initiating Cells

colorectal cancer sample and two human ﬁbroblast cell lines
(MRC5 and hTERT; ref. 18) were used to produce FCM. These
were analyzed by multiplex cytokine arrays, revealing high
amounts of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, Rantes, Gro-a, and HGF,
but negligible quantities of EGF and FGFs (Fig. 4A).
Using the representative RASwt xenosphere M049, we
noticed that FCM from different ﬁbroblast cell lines induced
cell proliferation proportionally to the amount of HGF
secreted. Indeed, the FCM from senescent CAFs (p9), where
most cytokines were still abundant, but HGF was signiﬁcantly reduced, did not induce proliferation (Fig. 4A and B).
At odds, changes in contents of other cytokines (e.g., IL-6,
Rantes, or Gro-a) did not correlate with changes in xenosphere viability (Fig. 4A and B). Moreover, FCM-induced
proliferation was completely blocked by JNJ-38877605, a
speciﬁc inhibitor of the HGF receptor, MET (Fig. 4B; ref. 17),
or by the anti-MET monovalent antibody DN30-FAB (Supplementary Fig. S3A; ref. 31). Importantly, FCM not only
sustained the growth of xenospheres, but it also protected
them from cetuximab (Fig. 4B). Similarly, coculture with
hTERT ﬁbroblasts also sustained xenosphere growth and
viability, which were impaired after the addition of JNJ38877605, but not of cetuximab (Fig. 4C).
The proliferative effect of FCM, as well as FCM contribution
to resistance against EGFR inhibition, was conﬁrmed on RASwt
M016, M049, and M195; in the presence of FCM, cetuximab and
geﬁtinib did not affect viability (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig.
S3B), nor did they promote caspase activation (Fig. 4E and
Supplementary Fig. S3C). Conversely, JNJ-38877605 completely
blocked proliferation and induced apoptosis (Fig. 4D and E and
Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C), attesting that HGF mediates
the protective activity of FCM. Interestingly, in RASwt M199,
FCM promoted viability, but inhibition by JNJ-38877605 was
attenuated (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C) likely by the
expression of a strong EGF autocrine loop (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Consistently, this xenosphere maintained sensitivity to
EGFR inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C).
The role of HGF in sustaining CCIC proliferation was further
conﬁrmed by supplying puriﬁed HGF as a single growth factor
(Fig. 5A). RASwt M016 and M049 were treated with cetuximab
in the presence of HGF or IL-8, another cytokine particularly
abundant in FCM (Fig. 4A). HGF, but not IL-8, signiﬁcantly
protected both xenospheres from cetuximab, by preserving cell
viability and inhibiting apoptosis (Fig. 5B and C). Protection
was likely mediated by activation of mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways, which remained high
when HGF was supplied together with cetuximab, and was
extinguished when the MET inhibitor was also added (Fig. 5D).
Similar to our observations with FCM, protection against
cetuximab by puriﬁed HGF was dose-dependent (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
MET expression in xenospheres
Signiﬁcant expression of MET was veriﬁed in all xenospheres by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5E) and ﬂow cytometry
(Fig. 5F). As an exception, among RASwt xenospheres, M199
displayed lower levels of MET and, consistently, weaker proliferative response to HGF (Fig. 5A). Low MET expression also

www.aacrjournals.org

contributed to explain why this xenosphere was poorly sensitive to MET inhibitors when grown in FCM (Supplementary
Fig. S3B and S3C). In RASmut xenospheres, which also
expressed high levels of MET, HGF stimulated MET activation
(Supplementary Fig. S4C), but did not increase their autonomous proliferation rate (not shown). Interestingly, in all xenospheres cultured in prodifferentiating conditions, except in
RASmut M126, MET protein expression decidedly decreased
(Fig. 5E), indicating preferential association of MET expression
with the stem/progenitor status. Notably, serum-induced differentiation affected EGFR expression randomly, with reduced
protein levels in three xenospheres (M016, M199, and M138)
and increased levels in the remaining ﬁve (M049, M195, M119,
M126, and M211; Fig. 5E).
RASwt spheropatients display enhanced response to
combined EGFR and MET inhibition
Data obtained in vitro support the hypothesis that HGF
secretion by CAFs provides a mechanism of CCIC primary
resistance to cetuximab, which can be counteracted by MET
inhibition. Consistently, we observed that HGF expression in
tumors of patients who progressed on cetuximab was significantly higher than that of responders, as assessed by analyzing
publicly available gene expression datasets of human KRASwt
metastatic colorectal cancers annotated for response to cetuximab monotherapy (Fig. 6A; ref. 20).
The efﬁcacy of MET inhibitors cannot be assessed in a
classical xenograft model, as murine HGF does not activate
the human MET receptor (32, 33). Consistently, M049 spheropatient did not respond to treatment with JNJ-38877605 as a
single agent (as previously observed in RASwt xenopatients;
ref. 34), or in combination with cetuximab (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). We thus generated two experimental settings to
include human HGF in the murine tumor microenvironment.
First, M049 xenospheres were transduced with a lentiviral
construct expressing the human HGF gene (M049-HGF) to
induce an autocrine loop (Supplementary Fig. S5B). This loop
was functional, as shown by administration of JNJ-38877605,
which decreased viability of M049-HGF, and, in the presence
of EGF, increased their sensitivity to cetuximab (Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D). Spheropatients were then obtained by
subcutaneous injection of M049-HGF into NOD/SCID mice,
and treated with placebo, cetuximab, JNJ-38877605, or both
inhibitors, for 6 weeks. MET inhibition alone slightly, but
signiﬁcantly, delayed tumor growth, although without inducing regression or stabilization. On the contrary, cetuximab
caused a 70% tumor regression that stabilized after 3 weeks.
Interestingly, the concomitant administration of cetuximab
and JNJ-38877605 resulted in more pronounced tumor regression, which continued up to 6 weeks of treatment, reaching
90% (Fig. 6B).
In the second experimental setting, mice were genetically
engineered by replacing the endogenous Hgf gene with the
human gene (hHGF-Ki), used as recipients of parental M049
xenospheres, and treated as above. In this case, JNJ-38877605
was ineffective as a single agent, but enhanced the rate of
tumor shrinkage when combined with cetuximab, again inducing up to 90% regression after 6 weeks (Fig. 6C).

As shown by immunohistochemistry of sections from

pathway. Combination of the two inhibitors effectively

impaired both signal transduction pathways (Fig. 6D), according to in vitro ﬁndings (Fig. 5D).
To assess long-term therapeutic outcomes, M049-HGF
spheropatients were treated up to 6 months with cetuximab
and JNJ-38877605, alone or in combination (Fig. 6E), as above.

MET in Colon Cancer–Initiating Cells

In these experiments, the groups initially treated with vehicle
or JNJ-38877605 alone started to receive cetuximab when
tumors reached a volume of 1,400 or 1,300 mm3, respectively.
By this strategy, we could monitor the consequences of delayed
cetuximab administration in mice that were either na€ve for
any inhibitor or "primed" by prior MET inhibition. Tumors
treated with cetuximab alone from the beginning experienced
a maximum regression of 70% that stabilized after 6 weeks and,
at 12 weeks, started to display a slight but continuous trend to
regrowth, regaining 40% of the baseline volume after 24 weeks.
Mice treated with the two inhibitors from the beginning
showed a decidedly more pronounced tumor regression than
mice treated with cetuximab alone, reaching a maximum 94%
tumor shrinkage after 9 weeks, which stabilized without any
statistically signiﬁcant change until 24 weeks. The outcomes of
the groups with delayed administration of cetuximab were
comparable with the corresponding "early" treatment groups
(Supplementary Table S3); tumors that received delayed cetuximab monotherapy reached a maximum 75% regression 4
weeks after treatment initiation, and, at the end of the experiment (17 weeks after treatment initiation), regained 58% of the
baseline volume. Tumors initially treated with JNJ-38877605
and experiencing delayed addition of cetuximab displayed
continuous regression, reaching 90% reduction of their maximum volume (Fig. 6E).
Consistently, tumors explanted after 6 months of treatment
with cetuximab alone exhibited basally (re)activated MAPK
and AKT pathways, whereas tumors treated with both inhibitors did not show any sign of pathway activity (Fig. 6F).
Moreover, tumors treated with both inhibitors showed signs
of increased pseudodifferentiation, such as increased stromal
density, and reduced epithelial cellularity, with adenomatous
phenotype (Fig. 6F) and increased expression of cytokeratin 20
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). Interestingly, tumors treated with
both inhibitors showed decreased expression of stem-cell
markers such as LGR5 and b-catenin, as well as the corresponding xenospheres treated in vitro showed decreased
expression of CD24, CD133, CD44, and MET (Supplementary
Fig. S6A and S6B).

Discussion
Over decades, cell lines contributed to unravel the genetic
basis of cancer pathogenesis and to identify therapeutic
targets. Nevertheless, their validity for the preclinical screening of anticancer drugs has been challenged (reviewed in
refs. 35, 36). Indeed, cancer cell lines may fail to recapitulate
the overall features of the original tumor, because, after the
several in vitro passages required to achieve immortalization, they might have genetically drifted and lost differentiation plasticity (37).

The quest for cells maintaining the genetic and histogenetic
properties of the original tumors has led to tumor "spheres,"
primary cultures established by a protocol initially set up for
neural stem cells (38), and later successfully applied to several
tumor tissues, including colorectal cancer (7, 11, 23, 24). These
cells display the operational properties of cancer stem cells,
or CICs. Indeed, they retain long-term self-renewal ability in
vitro, and, when implanted in immunocompromised mice,
form tumors almost indistinguishable from the originals
(7, 37). Notably, tumor spheres retain the genetic make-up of
the original cancer far more faithfully than standard cell lines
(37); thus, regardless of their "stem" properties, they should be
more suitable than cell lines to identify the mechanisms
responsible for sensitivity and resistance to molecular cancer
therapeutics.
Spheres obtained from colorectal cancer, or "colospheres,"
were used to demonstrate CIC resistance to conventional
therapies (12); however, to our knowledge, little has been done
so far to characterize their genetic proﬁles, and to relate them
to response to targeted therapies.
In this work, from human colorectal cancer metastases
xenografted in mice, the so-called "xenopatients" (4), we
derived spheres named "xenospheres." Colorectal cancer xenopatients allowed (i) to reproduce the therapeutic response to
anti-EGFR antibodies observed in human patients, (ii) to
validate negative predictors of response, such as mutations
in RAS pathway genes, (iii) to discover HER2 ampliﬁcation as a
novel mechanism of primary resistance, and (iv) to validate
HER2 as an effective therapeutic target in combination with
EGFR inhibitors (4). More recently, xenopatients contributed
to demonstrate that ampliﬁcation of the MET oncogene is a
mechanism of both primary and secondary resistance to antiEGFR therapies (3).
Taking advantage of data available in the original corresponding patients and xenopatients, here we show that xenospheres (i) retain the same genetic lesions of the tumor of
origin and (ii) generate tumor xenografts (spheropatients)
that recapitulate the histologic heterogeneity of the corresponding xenopatients (and thus of the corresponding
patients). We also show that (iii) the spheropatient response
to the anti-EGFR antibody is comparable with the response
observed in the corresponding xenopatients, in accordance
with the mutational status of KRAS. We, thus, conclude that
xenospheres are a reliable, molecularly annotated, in vitro
model of CCICs, able to retain from the tumor of origin, and
pass to a secondary tumor (spheropatient), the genetic determinants of therapeutic response.
We then conﬁrmed, for the ﬁrst time in CCIC, the relevance
of the KRAS gene status for proliferation and survival. Indeed,
xenospheres harboring a KRAS mutation self-sustain their

growth and are insensitive to exogenous growth factors. Conversely, xenospheres with wild-type KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF
cannot grow and survive unless supplied with exogenous
growth factors. Although the number of cases examined was
limited, we show that RASwt xenospheres are exquisitely
sensitive to EGF; indeed, they proliferate at an EGF molar
concentration one log lower than that required for other
growth factors such as FGF or HGF. In some cases, xenospheres express EGF autocrine loops able to maintain basal
survival signals, although insufﬁcient to sustain autonomous
proliferation. We therefore show that the response of the
original xenopatients (and patients) to EGFR inhibition is
rooted in CCICs: if RAS pathway genes are intact, EGFR
inhibitors can stop tumor growth by hitting the tumorigenic
cell subpopulation.
However, we also found that, in this subpopulation, EGFR
may be the dominant but not the unique regulator of proliferation. The HGF receptor MET was expressed in all xenospheres, and, unlike EGFR, it was downregulated in their in
vitro differentiated derivatives, suggesting a speciﬁc association of MET expression with—and possibly a speciﬁc function
within—the stem/progenitor compartment. Consistently, we
and others have recently reported that MET is expressed in
glioblastoma stem cells and promotes their self-renewal (39–
41). Concerning colorectal cancer, it was previously shown that
HGF can sustain the WNT self-renewal pathway (42, 43). Yet,
the ability of HGF to sustain long-term CCIC proliferation was
unknown. We show here that HGF can promote RASwt CCIC
proliferation, and that inherent expression of the wild-type
MET gene in these cells is a factor of primary resistance to
anti-EGFR therapy, a ﬁnding with salient implications for
colorectal cancer pathogenesis and therapy.
Although MET ampliﬁcation likely represents a rare mechanism of primary resistance to EGFR inhibition (1% of xenopatients; ref. 3), intrinsic expression of wild-type MET, together
with physiologic secretion of HGF by CAFs, may provide a more
widespread mechanism. Indeed, we show that, in the microenvironment generated by conditioned media or cocultures of
CAFs, HGF is so abundant that it may take the lead over other
growth factors, including EGF, to regulate CCIC proliferation
and survival. As a result, in the presence of excess HGF, MET
inhibition, but not EGFR inhibition, is sufﬁcient to stop the
growth of CCIC. Primary resistance provided by HGF may be
relevant in human patients, as suggested by our analysis of data
from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who received
cetuximab as monotherapy (20); indeed, high HGF expression
in KRASwt tumors associates with poor response to cetuximab.
The ability of MET to support CCIC growth in vitro
prompted us to reconsider previous results showing that, in
xenopatients, MET inhibition failed to block metastatic colorectal cancer featuring wild-type MET (34). Indeed, those
experiments were performed in regular immunocompromised

mice (NOD/SCID), where murine HGF exerts negligible effects,
as it does not cross-react with human MET (32, 33). To better
evaluate the contribution of HGF to CCIC tumorigenicity, we
generated two RASwt spheropatient models by engineering
either the xenospheres or the mice to express human HGF. In
these models, MET inhibition alone could not induce significant tumor regression; however, when it was combined with
EGFR inhibition, regression was boosted and stabilized for
long time, delaying, and possibly preventing, tumor relapse.
Importantly, the combined treatment resulted in decreased
expression of cancer stem cell markers, in vitro and in vivo,
indicating empowered targeting of CCICs.
Previous studies have shown that HGF sustains resistance
against EGFR inhibition in cell lines (44, 45). We now suggest
that concomitant inhibition of the two targets—MET and
EGFR—hits CCICs that feature deﬁned genetic traits such as
wild-type RAS pathway genes. This approach may help to
prevent resistance to targeted therapies and lead to a virtually
complete and durable tumor regression.
