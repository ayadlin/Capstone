Abstract
Berberine, a natural product derived from a plant used in Chinese herbal medicine, is reported to exhibit
anticancer effects; however, its mechanism of action is not clearly defined. Herein, we demonstrate that
berberine induces apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells by downregulating the MDM2
oncoprotein. The proapoptotic effects of berberine were closely associated with both the MDM2 expression
levels and p53 status of a set of ALL cell lines. The most potent apoptosis was induced by berberine in ALL cells
with both MDM2 overexpression and a wild-type (wt)-p53, whereas no proapoptotic effect was detected in ALL
cells that were negative for MDM2 and wt-p53. In contrast to the conventional chemotherapeutic drug
doxorubicin, which induces p53 activation and a subsequent upregulation of MDM2, berberine strongly induced
persistent downregulation of MDM2 followed by a steady-state activation of p53. We discovered that downregulation of MDM2 in ALL cells by berberine occurred at a posttranslational level through modulation of death
domain-associated protein (DAXX), which disrupted the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP interactions and thereby
promoted MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation. Given that MDM2-overexpressing cancer cells are
commonly chemoresistant, our findings suggest that this naturally derived agent may have a highly useful
role in the treatment of cancer patients with refractory disease. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9895–904. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The human MDM2 gene is an oncogene that is amplified in
a variety of human cancers (1). In addition, high levels of
MDM2 expression are observed in those malignancies without
MDM2 gene amplification, such as in leukemia (2). MDM2
gained considerable attention following its identification as
the protein that negatively regulates p53. The N-terminus of
the MDM2 protein binds to p53, restraining p53-mediated
transcription (3); and the C-terminus of MDM2 acts as an E3
ubiquitin ligase, mediating the degradation of p53 (4). Conversely, the MDM2 gene is a transactivation target of p53; thus,
MDM2 and p53 form a negative feedback loop (5, 6). In normal
growing or unstressed cells, MDM2 regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, but p53 does not regulate

expression of MDM2 (7). However, in response to cellular
stress and DNA damage, such as during cancer treatment, p53
is rapidly accumulated and activated, inducing increased
expression of MDM2 and other p53 target genes such as
p21 and PUMA, which induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
(7–9). This p53-mediated increase in MDM2 expression will
begin to degrade p53 and repress its function. These last
actions are likely part of an important mechanism for the
development of chemoresistance, in particular for hematopoietic malignancies and many pediatric cancers in which
neoplastic cells have a wild-type (wt)-p53 phenotype and
originally overexpressed MDM2.
The MDM2 is itself an unstable protein that is ubiquitinated
in an autocatalytic manner (10). Studies have demonstrated
that the self- and p53-target ubiquitination functions of MDM2
are regulated by the death domain-associated protein (DAXX)
and the deubiquitinating enzyme, HAUSP. HAUSP regulates
deubiquitination of both p53 and MDM2 (11) whereas DAXX is
an apoptosis-regulating protein that induces cell death or
survival, which is closely associated with MDM2 and p53
(12, 13). Recent studies demonstrated that MDM2, DAXX,
and HAUSP interact with each other to form a tertiary complex.
This complex formation reduces self-ubiquitination of MDM2,
maintaining MDM2 ligase activity toward p53 under nonstress
conditions. During cellular stress and DNA damage such as
treatment with the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and
VP-16, DAXX–MDM2–HAUSP complex is disrupted, increasing MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation, which leads to
the stabilization and accumulation of p53 (14, 15).

Berberine, an alkaloid that was initially isolated from
Chinese herbs, is currently used as a traditional medicine that
can treat bacterial diarrhea. There is evidence of the anticancer
effect of berberine, as it inhibits cell growth and induces
apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines originating from
leukemia (16), epidermoid carcinoma (17), glioblastoma (18),
prostate carcinoma (19), and breast cancer (20). In addition,
animal studies have shown that berberine can inhibit chemically induced carcinogenesis, tumor promotion, and tumor
invasion (21–23). Several recent studies have investigated the
possible signaling pathways and the molecular mechanisms for
the anticancer action of berberine, and they have found that
NF-kB (24) and p53 (25–27) are involved in berberine-mediated
cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.
Because many chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin
and VP-16 induce apoptosis in cancer cells through regulation
of MDM2 and p53, we investigated whether the signaling
pathway of apoptosis induced by berberine is similar or
different to that induced by doxorubicin, as we aimed to
investigate whether berberine could be used as a chemotherapeutic agent.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Seven acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines used in
this study were characterized in prior publications (28). Four
of these cell lines (EU-1, EU-4, EU-6, and EU-8) were established at Emory University. Sup-B13 and UOC-B1 was
obtained from Dr. Stephen D. Smith (University of Kansas
City) and the CCRE-CEM cell line was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. The berberine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog no.: B3251). The detailed
information for cell culture and treatment was described in
the supplemental data online.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot assay
Cells were lysed in a buffer composed of 50 mmol/L Tris at
pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmol/L
sodium phosphate, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/mL
aprotinin, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, and 10 mg/mL pepstatin. After
centrifugation, the clarified cell lysate was incubated with
15 mL Protein G plus/Protein A-agarose and 1 mg of antibodies
overnight at 4 C. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were
resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filter and
probed with specific antibodies. Protein expression was visualized with a chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce).
mRNA degradation rate and Northern blot assay
The degradation rate of mRNA was examined by a standard
actinomycin D and Northern blot assay. Briefly, at different times
after addition of 5 mg/mL actinomycin D, cells were harvested
and their total RNA isolated. RNA was electrophoresed using a
1% agarose/6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon
filter. Probes were prepared by a randomized labeling approach
using a-32P-dCTP. Following hybridization with probes and
washing, the filter was autoradiographed for 24 hours.

Pulse-chase assay
The turnover of protein was tested by a standard proteinsynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) assay. Briefly, cells
were treated with 50 mg/mL CHX for different times before lysis
in the presence or absence of berberine, and the expression of
MDM2, p53, and DAXX was detected by Western blot analysis.
Quantitative RT-PCR
The total RNA was extracted from cells with the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with a
mixture of random monomers and oligo-dT as primers. The
amplification was performed with a 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems), using the QuantiFast SYBR Green
RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All specific primers for amplification of specific genes and
the housekeeper gene GAPDH were purchased from Qiagen.
Polysome preparation and analysis
Cells were incubated with 100 mg/mL CHX for 15 minutes to
arrest polyribosome migration and then lysed to isolate
cytoplasmic extracts in a buffer containing 20 mmol/L TrisHCl at pH 8.0, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 500 U/mL RNAsin, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors,
followed by fractionation on 15% to 45% (w/v) sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW41Ti rotor at
39,000 rpm for 1 hour. Fractions were collected from each
gradient tube by upward replacement with monitored absorption at OD254 by using a fractionator (Brandel, Inc.). The RNA
in each fraction was extracted and subjected to quantitative
PCR as described below.
Plasmids and transfection
The human MDM2 expression plasmid (pCMV-MDM2) was
provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University. A
Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was
used to mutate the MDM2 464 so that cysteine is substituted
by alanine to generate plasmid pCMV-MDM2 C464A, which
exhibits loss of E3 ligase activity (29). The MDM2 and DAXX
gene promoters were generated by PCR and cloned into the
pGL3 basic vector to produce the MDM2 promoter 1 and
DAXX promoter–Luciferase constructs. The MDM2 p2-Luciferase plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Oren (Weizmann
Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Stable and transient gene
transfection and reporter assay were described in the supplemental data online.
WST cytotoxicity assay
Cells were cultured for 20 hours in 96-well microtiter plates
with different concentrations of reagents. Then, the watersoluble tetrazolium salt (WST) was added and the incubation
continued for additional 4 hours, after which the optical
density of the wells was read with a microplate reader set
at a test wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of
620 nm. Appropriate controls lacking cells were included to
determine background absorbance.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the cell cycle
position and apoptosis. For cell-cycle analysis, cells were

collected, rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol for
1 hour at 4 C, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 mL
PBS containing 20 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI) and 20 mg/mL
RNase A. After incubating at 4 C for at least 30 minutes, the
samples were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson)
with WinList software (Verity Software House, Inc.).
For the quantitative detection of apoptotic cells by annexinV staining, cells with or without treatment were washed once
with PBS and stained with fluorescien isothiocyanate (FITC)–
annexin-V and PI, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stained cells were analyzed either by fluorescence
microscopy or by flow cytometry.

Results
Berberine strongly induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis
in ALL cells with wt-p53 and MDM2 overexpression
We examined the effect of berberine on the cell viability using
the WST cytotoxic assay in 6 ALL lines (Fig. 1A). Berberine
exhibited strongly cytotoxic activity in the 2 wt-p53/MDM2overexpressing ALL cell lines EU-1 and Sup-B13 (Supplementary Table S1). Berberine showed relatively low cytotoxicity in
the mutant-p53 cell lines and the p53-null line that expressed
low levels of MDM2, whereas no cytotoxic effect of berberine
was detected in the MDM2-negative line with a p53-null
phenotype. To clarify whether the observed cell death induced
by berberine was associated with induction of apoptosis, we
stained the cells with an annexin-V–FITC and viewed them by
fluorescence microscopy. As seen in Fig. 1B (upper panel), over
90% of the cells were annexin-V–positive in berberine-treated

wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing EU-1 cells. As is also seen in this
figure (bottom panel), the berberine-induced death of the
mutant-p53/MDM2-expressing EU-6 cells was also due to
apoptosis. Fig. 1C shows the quantities of apoptotic cells in
the 6 ALL cell lines treated with different doses of berberine,
detected by flow cytometry. Results were consistent with the
WST results: Berberine induced very strong apoptosis in
MDM2-overexpressing/wt-p53 cells, but apoptosis was not
strong in cells expressing no or low levels of MDM2. This
was further confirmed by a Western blot assay to evaluate
the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP during
berberine treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP was detected at 6 hours after berberine treatment of
MDM2-overexpressing/wt-p53 cells whereas cleavage of these
proteins was not tested until 24 hours after berberine treatment
of MDM2-expressing/p53-mutant cells. No cleavage of caspase3 and PARP was observed even at 24 hours after similar
berberine treatment of MDM2-negative/p53-null cells.
Berberine-induced cell death in wt-p53 cells is mainly
through induction of p53
Because berberine induces apoptosis in wt-p53 cells, we
tested the effect of berberine on the activation of p53 and its
known targets p21, PUMA, and Bax. By quantitative RT-PCR
and by Western blot assays, we found that berberine could
induce the p53 protein, but not p53 mRNA expression in the
wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2A–C). The expression of both mRNA and protein for p21 and PUMA was
remarkably induced by berberine. Corresponding with the
observed accumulation of p53 and induction of p21 and

PUMA, there was a G1 cell-cycle arrest and cell death detected
in wt-p53 Sup-B13 cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, there were rapid
S and G2/M depletion and cell death (sub-G1 DNA content is
indicated by an arrow in Fig. 2D), whereas the number of G1
cells was even increased. Berberine did not induce cell arrest
in G1 phase in mutant (EU-6) and null p53 (EU-8) ALL cells
with a similar treatment (Fig. 2D).
Berberine promotes p53 activity by downregulating
MDM2
We investigated the molecular mechanism by which berberine activates p53, as compared with doxorubicin that induces
p53 through DNA damage. Results showed that although berberine and doxorubicin increased expression of p53 in wt-p53
cells in a similar dose-dependent manner, they did not in the
mutant-p53 cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, berberine downregulated MDM2 expression in all 3 ALL cell lines studied, regardless
of their p53 status, suggesting that berberine-mediated MDM2

downregulation is p53-independent. In contrast, treatment with
doxorubicin upregulated MDM2 expression in the wt-p53 cells
and the expression of MDM2 remained unchanged in mutantp53 cells, suggesting that doxorubicin-mediated MDM2 upregulation is p53 dependent. In a detailed kinetic study of the
regulation of MDM2 and p53, we found that in berberine-treated
cells, MDM2 downregulation occurred as early as 1 hour and
persisted until 24 hours after treatment. However, doxorubicin
treatment induced a rapid and transient (1–2 hours) reduction
of MDM2, followed by a remarkable upregulation of this protein
(Fig. 3B). As is also shown in Fig. 3B, berberine treatment
induced p53 expression in 4 hours, whereas doxorubicin treatment took only an hour to significantly induce p53.
Berberine downregulates MDM2 at the
posttranslational level
We wished to investigate further how MDM2 is regulated by
berberine. We first performed quantitative RT-PCR for the

expression of MDM2 mRNA in berberine-treated cells. Unexpectedly, we found that berberine did not inhibit MDM2
mRNA expression; instead, the MDM2 mRNA level actually
increased. Compared to MDM2 mRNA regulation in doxorubicin-treated EU-1 cells, where MDM2 mRNA levels
increased as early as 1 hour after treatment, the increase in
MDM2 mRNA in the same cells treated with berberine
occurred at 4 hours posttreatment (Fig. 4A). This pattern of
kinetic induction of MDM2 mRNA was consistent with p53
activation in both the doxorubicin and berberine-treated cells,
because significant p53 activation was found to occur at 1 and
4 hours after being given each drug, respectively (Fig. 3B),
These results suggest that induction of MDM2 mRNA by
berberine and doxorubicin could be attributed to the observed
activation of p53, as it is a transactivator of MDM2 (30).
Berberine did not directly regulate MDM2 transcription,
which was confirmed by a reporter assay in a p53-null ALL
cell line (Fig. S1). Northern blot results showed that the
stability of MDM2 mRNA was not affected by berberine
(Fig. 4B). Results from polysome profiling showed that berberine also did not regulate MDM2 translation, as no effect of
berberine on the polyribosome profile of MDM2 was detected
(Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, we measured the turnover of both MDM2 and
p53 after berberine treatment by pulse-chase assay. The halflife of MDM2 in untreated cells was larger than 90 minutes,
whereas berberine decreased that MDM2 half-life to less than
30 minutes. In contrast, the half-life of p53 in untreated cells
was less than 30 minutes, whereas it was remarkably increased
by berberine (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that the
berberine-downregulated MDM2 and the berberine-upregulated p53 expression occur only at the posttranslational level.
Berberine increases MDM2 self-ubiquitination by
disrupting MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP interactions
We investigated whether berberine, like doxorubicin,
induces a similar disruption of the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP
complex. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assay
results showed that berberine abolished the interactions of
MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP. As seen in Fig. 5A, the levels of MDM2,

www.aacrjournals.org

DAXX, and HAUSP were significantly reduced after only 10 to
20 minutes of treatment, when the immunocomplex was
precipitated with DAXX, HAUSP, and MDM2 antibodies,
suggesting that the 3 proteins were dissociated. Importantly,
we also found that the disruption of MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP
interactions resulted in enhanced MDM2 ubiquitination
(Fig. 5B).
To further confirm that berberine induces self-ubiquitination of MDM2, we tested the effect of berberine on MDM2
expression and ubiquitination in EU-4 cells that were stably
transfected with the mutant MDM2 plasmid pCMV-MDM2
C464A, providing an MDM2 that lacks ubiquitin E3 ligase
activity due to the cysteine 464 that is mutated to alanine (29).
Results showed that the mutant MDM2 protein in EU-4 cells
transfected with pCMV-MDM2 C464A was indeed resistant to
berberine-mediated downregulation (Fig. 5C) and unable to
self-ubiquitinate (Fig. 5D), suggesting that berberine downregulated the wt-MDM2 specifically through induction of selfubiquitination.
Berberine modulates DAXX expression at the
transcriptional level
Because berberine induced a similar disruption of the
MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex like doxorubicin, the question raised was why berberine induced a persistent degradation of MDM2, whereas doxorubicin only induced a transient
downregulation of MDM2 that was followed by an increase in
MDM2 expression. We hypothesized that the differential
regulation of MDM2 in cells treated with berberine and
doxorubicin may likely be associated with some distinct role
they may play in regulating DAXX or HAUSP that could help
explain the later events. Therefore, we compared the expression levels of DAXX and HAUSP in berberine and doxorubicintreated cells. Consistent with previous studies (15), doxorubicin does not affect the expression of DAXX nor HAUSP
(Fig. 6A, upper panel, right). Interestingly, in berberine-treated
cells, the expression of HAUSP remained unchanged, but the
drug downregulated the DAXX in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 6A, upper panel, left and lower panel). To
evaluate the mechanism by which berberine regulates DAXX,

The mRNA levels of MDM2 relative to an internal control GAPDH were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. B, EU-1 cells were treated with or without
berberine for 4 hours, followed by addition of 5 mg/mL actinomycin D. At different time points, the cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated. The amount
of MDM2 mRNA remaining was determined by Northern blotting and quantified by densitometric analysis. C, EU-1 cells were treated with or without 50 mmol/L
berberine for 8 hours, and cytoplasmic lysates were fractionated on sucrose gradient. RNA was extracted from each of the fractions and subjected to
quantitative RT-PCR for quantitative analysis of the distribution of MDM2 and actin mRNAs. Data represent percentage of the total amount of corresponding
mRNA on each fraction. D, turnover of MDM2 and p53 proteins in berberine-treated and untreated cells, as detected by pulse-chase assay. EU-1 cells

were prepared and analyzed by Western blot assay. The Western blot film for p53 was developed at 1 hour (dev 1h) and 2 hours (dev 2h), respectively.

we first tested the effect of berberine on DAXX transcription.
Gene transfection and reporter analysis showed that the
DAXX promoter activity was specifically inhibited by berberine (Fig. 6B). The expression of endogenous DAXX mRNA in
the same cells was also inhibited by berberine as detected by
RT-PCR (Fig. 6B, inset), suggesting that berberine suppress
DAXX transcription. Northern blot results indicated that the
stability of DAXX mRNA was not affected by berberine
(Fig. 6C). In additional pulse-chase experiments, DAXX protein turnover was not affected by berberine (Fig. 6D), unlike
the drug's effect on MDM2 and p53.

Discussion
In the present study, we sought to test the response of
pediatric ALL cells to berberine-induced cytotoxicity and
apoptosis, and evaluate its underlying mechanism of anticancer action. We demonstrated that the response of ALL

9900

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

cells to berberine was tightly associated with both MDM2
expression levels and p53 status. The ALL cell lines having
both MDM2 overexpression and a wt-p53 phenotype were
found to be very sensitive to berberine, whereas cell lines
lacking MDM2 expression and without wt-p53 did not
respond to berberine. The distinct responses to berberine
of ALL cells with different MDM2 expression levels and p53
status were attributed to changes in regulation of MDM2
and p53. We discovered that berberine specifically and
strongly induced degradation of MDM2 by activating its
own self-ubiquitination, which then resulted in the persistent activation of p53, so that potent apoptosis occurred in
wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing cells. Due to their lack of
MDM2 and wt-p53, there was no response to berberine in
ALL cells with MDM2/wt-p53 null phenotypes. In MDM2expressing/p53-deficient ALL cells, a moderate apoptosis
induced by berberine was most likely attributed to the
p53-independent role of MDM2.

A significant finding of the present study is the identification of the unique role of berberine in inducing potent
apoptosis in ALL cells that are known to be resistant to
conventional chemotherapy. Doxorubicin, the most frequently
used chemotherapeutic drug, is known to cause DNA damage
and kill cancer cells mainly by a p53-dependent mechanism of
apoptosis (32, 33). However, resistance to doxorubicin is
observed not only in cancer cells having p53 mutations, but
also in wt-p53 cancer cells that express high level of the p53
inhibitor MDM2. We previously reported that primary leukemic cells derived from pediatric ALL patients that express wtp53 and overexpress MDM2 are usually resistant to doxorubicin (34). The 2 wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing ALL cell lines
EU-1 and Sup-B13 that were used in the present study are
resistant to doxorubicin. However, these 2 cell lines were quite
efficiently killed by berberine, making it a drug candidate of
prime interest to investigate further.
Our in-depth mechanistic studies revealed the reason why
doxorubicin-resistant wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing ALL cells
were sensitive to berberine. Different regulation of MDM2 in
cells treated by doxorubicin and berberine was involved. Prior
to this study, advanced studies of MDM2 and p53 interactions
had demonstrated that the self- and p53-target ubiquitination
function of MDM2 is regulated by DAXX and HAUSP (14). In
unstressed cells, MDM2 interacts with DAXX and HAUSP and
is stabilized in the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex, which

leads to persistent ubiquitination and degradation of the
tumor suppressor p53. Under conditions of cellular stress
and DNA damage, such when challenged with doxorubicin
(Fig. S2A), MDM2 becomes dissociated from the MDM2–
DAXX–HAUSP complex resulting in instability, as MDM2
self-ubiquitination and degradation occur. Due to the release
of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, p53 becomes immediately
activated, which, in turn, induces MDM2 production, because
MDM2 is a transactivation target of p53. In the presence of
intact DAXX and HAUSP, the newly synthesized MDM2 could
associate with DAXX and HAUSP again leading to stabilization
of MDM2 and new ubiquitination and degradation of p53. It is
possible that this is the mechanism for the development of
doxorubicin resistance in MDM2-overexpressing cancer cells,
as p53 degradation would deny p53-dependent apoptosis.
The MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP interactions were also rapidly
disrupted in berberine-treated cells, so a similar reduction of
MDM2 as was seen in doxorubicin-treated cells appeared to
occur (Fig. S2B). Differences from doxorubicin treatment;
however, followed: In the berberine-treated cells, a steadystate downregulation of MDM2 occurred within 1 hour and
MDM2 became barely detectable by 8 to 16 hours posttreatment, which was the point at which p53 was maximally
accumulated. Although new MDM2 was synthesized by the
activated p53, as seen by an increase in MDM2 mRNA levels in
berberine-treated cells (Fig. 4A), MDM2 protein was rapidly

Figure 6. Modulation of DAXX by berberine. A, EU-1 cells were treated with different doses of berberine and doxorubicin, respectively, for 4 hours and then
DAXX and HAUSP protein levels were detected by Western blot (upper panel). EU-1 cells were treated with 50 mmol/L berberine for different times; Western
blot was performed to detect levels of DAXX and HAUSP (lower panel). B, EU-4 cells were transfected with 5 mg DAXX promoter luciferase plasmid by
electroporation. At 24 hours after transfection, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of berberine (10, 50, and 100 mmol/L) or increasing dose of
doxorubicin (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mmol/L) for another 4 hours, and then cell extracts were prepared for testing of luciferase activity. Inset, cells were treated
with 50 mmol/L berberine for different times and the expression levels of endogenous DAXX mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. C, DAXX mRNA degradation
rate in berberine-treated EU-1 cells was detected by Northern blot assay as described in Fig. 4B. D, turnover of DAXX protein in berberine-treated and

self-ubiquitinated and degraded. The persistent self-ubiquitination of MDM2 in the berberine-treated cells was found to be
due to the lack of formation of a new MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP
complex. In further studies, we demonstrated that berberine
uniquely downregulated the expression of DAXX in a doseand time-dependent manner and because of that DAXX
absence in berberine-treated cells, no new formation of the
MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex was possible, so the p53induced newly synthesized MDM2 constitutively underwent
self-ubiquitination and degradation. The result of berberine
treatment, therefore, was a steady-state activation of p53 and
constant potent apoptosis activity if cells were originally of the
wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing phenotype.
Although further studies are required to investigate the
mechanism by which berberine inhibits DAXX transcription,
our studies so far have demonstrated a critical role for DAXX in
promoting berberine-induced cell death. Previous studies have
shown that loss of DAXX results in extensive apoptosis in early
development (35), and silencing of DAXX expression by RNAi in
cancer cells ends up sensitizing them to multiple apoptosis
pathways (36, 37). Our own observations in berberine-treated
ALL cell lines were consistent with that findings. We also tested
to confirm the effect of silencing of DAXX by siRNA on
regulation of MDM2 and p53 and apoptosis in wt-p53/

MDM2-overexpressing cells. Similar to berberine, DAXX siRNA
inhibited MDM2 and induced p53 (Fig. S3A), which resulted in
cell death (Fig. S3B). Interestingly, DAXX siRNA strongly sensitized wt-p53/MDM2-overexpressing ALL to doxorubicin
(Fig. S3C). The fact that berberine can suppress DAXX means
the molecule may prove to be of great use in treating resistant
cases. The preclinical and clinical studies would provide the
ultimate answer to the question of berberine's utility.
Because MDM2 is an important inhibitor of p53, and
because overexpression of MDM2 occurs in a variety of
cancers including leukemia, many efforts have been made
so far to target MDM2 or MDM2-mediated signaling to
prevent the apparent promotion of cancer and improve the
power of anticancer treatment. Direct silencing of MDM2
expression by antisense or siRNA and blocking of the binding
between MDM2 and p53 using small molecule inhibitors such
as nutlin-3 and MI-219 are being actively investigated (38–41).
However, targeting MDM2 by increasing MDM2 self-ubiquitination in cancer cells has not been investigated. We believe
that discovery of drugs to target MDM2 by disrupting
the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP interaction is an innovative concept in the development of therapies for cancer patients
whose neoplastic cells overexpress MDM2. Berberine is
one such drug. In the present study, we demonstrated that

should be developed as a particularly useful agent for the
treatment of high risk, refractory cancer patients.
