Abstract
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master transcription factor that controls cellular homeostasis.
Although its activation beneﬁts normal tissue, HIF-1 activation in tumors is a major risk factor for angiogenesis,
therapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis. HIF-1 activity is usually suppressed under normoxic conditions
because of rapid oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1a. Here, we show that, under normoxic conditions,
HIF-1a is upregulated in tumor cells in response to doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many
cancers. In addition, doxorubicin enhanced VEGF secretion by normoxic tumor cells and stimulated tumor
angiogenesis. Doxorubicin-induced accumulation of HIF-1a in normoxic cells was caused by increased expression and activation of STAT1, the activation of which stimulated expression of iNOS and its synthesis of nitric
oxide (NO) in tumor cells. Mechanistic investigations established that blocking NO synthesis or STAT1
activation was sufﬁcient to attenuate the HIF-1a accumulation induced by doxorubicin in normoxic cancer
cells. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that a chemotherapeutic drug can induce HIF-1a accumulation
in normoxic cells, an efﬁcacy-limiting activity. Our results argue that HIF-1a-targeting strategies may enhance
doxorubicin efﬁcacy. More generally, they suggest a broader perspective on the design of combination
chemotherapy approaches with immediate clinical impact. Cancer Res; 73(20); 6230–42. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Chemotherapy is the most common systemic treatment for
human cancers. Although tumors may initially respond to
chemotherapy with partial or even complete remission, they
often relapse with more aggressive malignant features such as
enhanced angiogenesis and chemoresistance. One principal
strategy that tumor cells employ to resist chemotherapy is to
highjack and exploit important homeostatic signaling pathways originally used by normal cells to adapt, survive, and
reconstruct microenvironment. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-1), a heterodimer of HIF-1a and HIF-1b, is such an
essential homeostatic protein (1). HIF-1 is a master transcripAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Radiation Oncology,2Surgery,

tional activator regulating hundreds of vital genes in all steps of
tumorigenesis and tumor progression including angiogenesis
(1), proliferation/apoptosis (2), therapeutic resistance (1, 3),
cancer stem cell maintenance/reprogramming (4), invasion/
metastasis (1), and energy metabolism (5). More importantly,
high HIF-1a level is an independent prognostic factor for poor
chemotherapeutic response, early recurrence, and shortened
survival time in many human cancers such as breast cancer (6).
Therefore, there is increasing interest to identify the mechanisms of HIF-1a upregulation in cancer cells and to develop
novel therapeutic strategies targeting HIF-1, thereby enhancing the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy (1).
Although HIF-1b is constitutively expressed, HIF-1a is rapidly degraded in proteasome after oxygen-dependent ubiquitination by the Von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL) complex
under normoxic conditions. Binding of pVHL depends on
hydroxylation of Pro402 and Pro564 in HIF-1a oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain. Because this hydroxylation
requires HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), oxygen (O2), and
iron (7, 8), hypoxia or iron chelators inhibit ODD-domain prolyl
hydroxylation to stabilize HIF-1a. The stabilized HIF-1a heterodimerizes with HIF-1b to form HIF-1, which transactivates
downstream gene expression such as VEGF. In addition to
prolyl hydroxylation, other posttranslational modiﬁcations of
HIF-1a such as cysteine S-nitrosylation (Cys533; ref. 9), lysine
acetylation (Lys532; ref. 10), or asparagine hydroxylation
(Asn803) in HIF-1a C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD)
by factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1; ref. 11) also regulate the
stability and transcriptional activity of HIF-1a. Accumulating
evidence has proved that hypoxia is one important, but not the

Doxorubicin Induces Normoxic HIF-1a Accumulation in Tumor Cells

only, factor stabilizing HIF-1a. Hypoxia-mimetic drug cobalt
chloride, iron chelators, nitric oxide (NO), free radicals, and
genetic alterations can enhance HIF-1 expression under normoxic conditions (1, 3, 9, 12–14).
Doxorubicin (adriamycin) is a ﬁrst-line chemotherapeutic
drug for treating a wide spectrum of cancers. Lee and
colleagues elegantly showed that doxorubicin inhibited
HIF-1 transcriptional activity by blocking the binding of
hypoxia-induced HIF-1 to DNA (15). HIF-1a knockdown or
inhibition increases the sensitivity of hypoxic tumor cells
to doxorubicin (16, 17). These studies suggest a synergistic
anticancer effect by combining chemotherapy with HIF-1
inhibition to target hypoxic tumor cells. In contrast to considerable investigations into the interplay between chemotherapeutic drug and HIF-1a under hypoxic conditions, so
far it is unknown whether chemotherapeutic drugs could
regulate HIF-1a expression under normoxic conditions. One
reason for this dearth is the technical difﬁculty of sensitively
detecting HIF-1a in cells exposed to both normoxia and
chemotherapy – two adverse conditions for HIF-1a expression because of oxygen-dependent HIF-1a degradation
and impaired protein synthesis machinery due to cytotoxicity. To elucidate the effects of chemotherapy on HIF-1a
expression in normoxic tumor cells, we used a 4T1 mouse
breast tumor cell line (4T1ODD-luc) that was stably transduced with a fused HIF-1a reporter gene consisting of
a mouse HIF-1a ODD domain and a ﬁreﬂy luciferase (9).
This reporter cell line allows noninvasive monitoring HIF-1a
expression with high sensitivity (9). Previous studies have
identiﬁed that doxorubicin concentrations in 4T1 and MCF-7
tumors ranged between 0 and 12 mg/mL (18, 19) and 0 and
8 mg/mL (20), respectively. By treating 4T1ODD-luc and
MCF-7 cells with doxorubicin at concentrations within
these ranges, we found increased HIF-1a expression under
normoxic conditions. We then investigated the effects of
this normoxic HIF-1a accumulation on VEGF secretion
and tumor angiogenesis after doxorubicin chemotherapy.
More importantly, we identiﬁed the underlying mechanism
that was the activation of the STAT1–iNOS–NO–HIF-1a
signaling pathway. In addition, we explored therapeutic
strategies to suppress doxorubicin-induced normoxic
HIF-1a accumulation. This work has important implications for trials targeting HIF-1a, which is upregulated not
only by hypoxia but also by chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
4T1 mouse breast tumor cells and MCF-7 human breast
cancer cells were obtained from the Duke University cell
culture facility in 2006. 4T1ODD-luc HIF-1a reporter cells were
obtained from Chuan-Yuan Li's laboratory in 2006. 4T1ODDluc and MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic under normoxic conditions (95% air, 5%
CO2). Then, 5  105 4T1ODD-luc or 1  106 MCF-7 cells per 10cm dish were plated for the Western blots. Similarly, 1  106
4T1ODD-luc cells per 10-cm dish or 2.5  105 MCF-7 cells per

well of six-well plates were plated overnight for ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS). The cells were cultured in fresh
medium with drugs the next day and continued for 24, 48, or
72 hours. Doxorubicin (Bedford Laboratories) concentrations
are provided in ﬁgures, or is 1 mg/mL (1.72 mmol/L) for 4T1
cells and 0.5 mg/mL (0.86 mmol/L) for MCF-7 cells. The concentrations of 1400W and EGCG (Cayman Chemical) were
10 mg/mL and 15 mmol/L, respectively. An equal volume of
solvent was used as the negative control. Hypoxic culture
condition was 0.5% O2, 5%CO2, and N2 balanced for 48 hours.
Bioluminescent imaging
HIF-1a ODD-luciferase reporter activity was quantiﬁed by
the Xenogen IVIS bioluminescence imaging system (9). For
this, 1  105 4T1ODD-luc cells per well of 12-well plates were
cultured with 2 mL culture medium overnight. The cells were
treated the next day with fresh medium containing doxorubicin (0.1, 1, or 10 mg/mL; 0.172–17.2 mmol/L) or an equal volume
of control vehicle for 24, 48, or 72 hours under normoxic
conditions. Alternatively, 1  105 4T1ODD-luc cells were
treated with 0.1, 1, or 10 mmol/L L-NAME (Sigma-Aldrich) or
control vehicle  1 mg/mL doxorubicin for 24, 48, or 72 hours.
Cell reporter activity and tumor volume were measured on day
0 before treatment and at multiple time-points posttreatment.
The mice were imaged 10 minutes after intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection of luciferin (150 mg/kg). Tumor bioluminescence
intensity was normalized to tumor volume at each time point.
Animal studies
In a mouse model, 5  106 4T1ODD-luc cells with 200 mL PBS
were injected orthotopically in the right thoracic mammary fat
pad of each female NCr/nu nude mouse (3). Tumor volume was
calculated as: volume ¼ (length  width2  p)/6. When tumor
size reached seven millimeter in diameter, animals were
randomized and injected with 100 mL saline (control) or a
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of doxorubicin (10 mg/kg)
via tail vein.
ELISA
A total of 1  105 4T1ODD-luc cells per well of 12-well plate
were cultured with one milliliter medium overnight. The cells
were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/mL of doxorubicin for
24, 48, and 72 hours. VEGF in culture medium was quantiﬁed
by a mouse VEGF ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was prepared using the miRVana extraction kit
(Applied Biosystems). One microgram of total RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit
(BioRad). Real-time PCR was conducted on a ABI7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System using Power SYBRGreen PCR Mix
(Applied Biosystems). PCR products were veriﬁed by melting
curves. The threshold cycle (CT) values for each gene were
normalized to expression levels of b-actin. The b-actin primers
were: forward 50 -GATTACTGCTCTGGCTCCTAGC-30 ; reverse
50 -GACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTGC-30 . The mouse iNOS primers were: forward 50 -CTGTGAGACCTTTGATGTCCGAAG-30 ;
reverse 50 -CTGGATGAGCCTATATTGCTGTGG-30 .

Western blot analysis
Protein samples from 4T1ODD-luc cells and MCF-7 cells
were respectively collected on days 2 and 3 posttreatment.
Nuclear proteins were extracted using a NucBuster kit (Novagen). Equal amounts of protein samples were loaded and
detected with corresponding antibodies: monoclonal mouse
anti-HIF-1a antibody (NB100-105, 1:500 dilution; Novus Biologicals), rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1a antibody (NB100-654,
1:500 dilution; Novus Biologicals), mouse anti-a-tubulin antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich), monoclonal mouse
anti-b-actin antibody (A2228, 1:5,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich),
polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS antibody (1:500 dilution; Assay
Designs), polyclonal sheep anti-histone H1 antibody (NB100748, 1:500 dilution; Novus Biologicals), rabbit anti-STAT1/
phosphor-STAT1 (Tyr701)/phosphor-STAT1 (Ser727) antibodies (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), and monoclonal rabbit anti-JAK2/phospho-JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008) antibodies (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology).
Immunohistochemical staining
Five to six orthotopic 4T1ODD-luc tumors per group were
collected on days 0, 1, 4, 7, and 16. Hypoxia marker pimonidazole (NPI) and perfusion marker Hoechst33342 (SigmaAldrich) were administered as described previously (14).
Thereafter, 10-mm frozen sections were made. HIF-1a ﬂuorescent staining was conducted with anti-HIF-1a antibody (Novus
Biologicals). Direct pimonidazole labeling was done using
Hypoxyprobe (NPI) with Zenon Alexa Fluor555 Mouse IgG
Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Scanned images of each entire tumor section were composited by Metamorph to compare the
areas of HIF-1a, pimonidazole, and Hoechst33342. Tumor
vasculature was stained with ﬂuorescein-labeled Griffonia
simplicifolia lectin I (isolectin B4, Vector Laboratories) as
previously described (21). Seven to 10 random ﬁelds (10)
per frozen section were analyzed to determine the mean value.
Tumor vascular fraction is the percentage of vessel area in total
tumor area in each ﬁeld. Tumor-activated macrophages (TAM)
were stained with rat anti-mouse CD68 antibody (Serotec)
and Alexa488-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Invitrogen).
FACS analysis
Single-cell suspensions were made after mild trypsinization
at each time point and incubated with the NO-speciﬁc probe
DAF-FM diacetate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). FACS was conducted on a FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The cells without DAF-FM
probe and the cells exposed to 0.2 mmol/L S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) for four hours were the negative and positive
controls, respectively.
Cell viability assay
CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega):
3  103 4T1ODD-luc cells per well of 96-well plates were
cultured with 100 mL medium overnight. We replaced the
medium with a fresh one containing control vehicle (PBS),
10 mg/mL 1400 W, or 15 mmol/L EGCG,  1 mg/mL doxorubicin
the next day. The treatments continued for 24, 48, and 72 hours.
Daily cell viability was quantiﬁed and normalized to the value

on day 0. WST-1 cell viability assay (Roche Applied Science):
cells were placed in a 96-well plate overnight and were treated
with 1 mg/mL doxorubicin, L-NAME (0.1, 1.0, or 10 mmol/L), or
a combination of these compounds the next day. At 24, 48, and
72 hours posttreatment, the WST-1 reagent was added to
the wells and cell viability was assessed by a spectrometer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
STAT1 silencing
A total of 1  106 4T1 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and
cultured in 5 mL medium overnight. The cells were then
transfected with either the STAT1 siRNA (ON-TARGETplus
SMARTpool, mouse STAT1) or the scrambled siRNA control (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) with the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
(Invitrogen). The cells were treated with 0.5 mg/mL doxorubicin or a vehicle control (PBS). Approximately 24 hours after
transfection and drug treatment, the media was replaced
with fresh media and drug. Cells were harvested 48 hours
posttreatment for assessment of STAT1 and HIF-1 protein
expression. These experiments were repeated four times.
Statistical analysis
Groups were ﬁrst tested for normality and variance homogeneity. Student t test was applied for two-group comparison.
One-way ANOVA Student–Newman–Keuls analysis was
applied for pairwise multiple comparisons. Difference was
considered signiﬁcant when P values were 0.05 or less.

Results
Doxorubicin increases HIF-1a level in tumor cells both
in vitro and in vivo
To determine whether doxorubicin affects HIF-1a level
in normoxic tumor cells, we treated 4T1ODD-luc reporter
cells with increased doxorubicin concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, or
10 mg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. All three concentrations
of doxorubicin induced signiﬁcant increases in HIF-1a
reporter activity 48 hours posttreatment (Fig. 1A and B).
However, 1 mg/mL of doxorubicin induced the most potent
upregulation of HIF-1a reporter activity on both 48 hours
and 72 hours posttreatment. To conﬁrm doxorubicininduced increase in normoxic HIF-1a accumulation, we
detected HIF-1a protein expression by Western blots, which
showed enhanced HIF-1a expression in 4T1ODD-luc cells
and MCF-7 cells posttreatment (Fig. 1C). This doxorubicininduced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation was also veriﬁed
by a hypoxia-induced HIF-1a control (Supplementary Fig.
S1). These results reveal that doxorubicin upregulates HIF1a expression in tumor cells under normoxic conditions
in vitro.
To further determine whether doxorubicin may affect HIF1a level in tumors, we intravenously injected MTD of doxorubicin into female nude mice with orthotopic 4T1ODD-luc
tumors. Mean bioluminescence intensities in doxorubicintreated tumors were signiﬁcantly higher than controls. The
major time window of the increase in HIF-1a reporter activity
in vivo was from day 3 through day 5 after doxorubicin

treatment (Fig. 1D and E). These ﬁndings suggest that doxorubicin chemotherapy upregulates HIF-1a level in tumor cells
in vivo.
Because hypoxia and poor perfusion are common causes
for HIF-1a upregulation in tumors, we next sought to
identify whether the earlier doxorubicin-induced in vivo
HIF-1a upregulation was due to potential changes in tumor
hypoxia or perfusion after doxorubicin therapy. We compared the positive-area fractions of HIF-1a, hypoxic marker
pimonidazole, and perfusion dye Hoechst 33342 in whole
frozen sections of 4T1ODD-luc tumors at multiple time
points posttreatment. Doxorubicin signiﬁcantly increased
tumor HIF-1a fraction on posttreatment days 1, 4, and 7
when compared with control treatment (Fig. 2A and B). The
increased HIF-1a fractions in doxorubicin-treated tumors
conﬁrmed the enhanced HIF-1a reporter activities as
described earlier (Fig. 1D and E). In contrast, there was no
difference in either the pimonidazole or perfused tumor
fractions (Hoechst 33342 labeling) between the doxorubicin-

www.aacrjournals.org

and the saline-treated tumors (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S2). These results suggest that doxorubicin-induced
HIF-1a upregulation was not caused by aggravated tumor
hypoxia or decreased perfusion.
Doxorubicin-induced HIF-1a upregulation stimulates
VEGF secretion by tumor cells in vitro and tumor
angiogenesis in vivo
One important consequence of HIF-1a upregulation is to
form HIF-1 to promote the expression of VEGF – one of the
most potent angiogenic factors (1, 2). Because doxorubicin
upregulates tumor cell HIF-1a both in vitro and in vivo, we
asked whether this doxorubicin-induced HIF-1a may stimulate VEGF secretion by tumor cells and promote tumor angiogenesis. Cell counting showed that the 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/mL
doxorubicin treatments signiﬁcantly reduced surviving cell
numbers, which were less than 40% of the control cell
numbers at all three time points posttreatment (Fig. 3A).
However, despite a much smaller surviving cell number, the

doxorubicin-treated cells secreted at least 87% of the amount
of VEGF secreted by the control cells on day 1 (Fig. 3B). This
pattern persisted on days 2 and 3 when, despite less than 30% of
relative surviving cell number post doxorubicin treatment
compared with control treatment, the VEGF secreted by this
small fraction of surviving cells was more than 60% of the
amount of VEGF secreted by the control cells. In other words,
the surviving doxorubicin-treated cells secreted an increased
amount of VEGF relative to control cells. The other piece of
evidence was that 1 mg/mL doxorubicin did lead to higher

6234

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

VEGF secretion than 0.1 mg/mL doxorubicin on both days 1
and 2 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, these data support that doxorubicin
stimulates VEGF secretion in surviving tumor cells. Because
tumor vascular index rather than tumor size is the most
reliable prognostic indicator for tumor relapse after chemotherapy, we then compared the relative tumor vascular fraction
in tumors treated with doxorubicin versus saline to see whether the doxorubicin-induced increase in VEGF secretion by
tumor cells may affect tumor angiogenesis. The relative tumor
vasculature fraction in doxorubicin-treated tumors was signiﬁcantly higher compared with the control tumors four days
after a single MTD treatment (Fig. 3C and D). These ﬁndings
suggest that doxorubicin not only upregulates HIF-1a expression and promotes VEGF secretion in surviving tumor cells, but
also stimulates tumor angiogenesis shortly after treatment.
NO and nitric oxide synthase play important roles in
doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation
Because the earlier results suggest that hypoxia is not the
cause for doxorubicin-induced HIF-1a upregulation, we
sought to identify other nonhypoxia factors that may upregulate HIF-1a. Kimura and colleagues reported that NO
donors stimulated HIF-1a expression and VEGF reporter
activity in normoxic tumor cells (22). In addition, Metzen
and colleagues found that NO impaired HIF-1a degradation
under normoxic conditions (23). Based on this converging
evidence, we investigated whether doxorubicin could increase intracellular NO level in normoxic 4T1ODD-luc cells.
The NO-speciﬁc ﬂuorescent probe DAF-FM diacetate showed that doxorubicin signiﬁcantly increased the intracellular
NO level compared with control treatment (Fig. 4A). Higher
concentrations of doxorubicin led to higher intracellular
NO level. The earlier HIF-1a bioluminescent reporter assay
(Fig. 1A) and Western blots (Supplementary Fig. S3) also
showed that higher concentrations of doxorubicin led to
more HIF-1a expression. The parallel changes in intracellular NO level and HIF-1a expression suggest that NO may
play an important role in doxorubicin-induced normoxic
HIF-1a accumulation. Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are
enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of NO from L-arginine.
The NOS family includes inducible NOS (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS). To identify
whether NOS participated in the doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation, we treated 4T1ODD-luc cells
with increasing concentrations of general NOS inhibitor
L-NAME with or without doxorubicin (Fig. 4B). In the control
group without doxorubicin, increasing concentrations of
L-NAME did not cause any difference in HIF-1a reporter
activity at each time point (Fig. 4B and C). Doxorubicin alone
signiﬁcantly increased HIF-1a reporter activity in the normoxic 4T1ODD-luc cells (Fig. 4B and D, empty column).
This ﬁnding is consistent with the results in Fig. 1A and B.
When L-NAME was combined with doxorubicin, the doxorubicin-induced enhancement of HIF-1a reporter activity
was signiﬁcantly suppressed (Fig. 4D). In addition, we conducted a quantitative WST-1 cell viability assay to compare
the surviving fraction of tumor cells at 24, 48, and 72 hours
after these treatments (Supplementary Fig. S4). Statistical

analysis revealed that the combination of doxorubicin þ LNAME (0.1, 1, 10 mmol/L) treatments did not increase cell
death compared with the treatment with doxorubicin alone
(Supplementary Fig. S4). This result rules out increased cell
death as a possible cause of decreased HIF-1a reporter
activity in the cells treated with doxorubicin þ L-NAME
(Fig. 4D). Therefore, the earlier experiments suggest that
NOS and NO participate in doxorubicin-induced normoxic
HIF-1a accumulation.
STAT1 and iNOS signaling pathway participates in
doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation
iNOS is the isoenzyme most commonly associated with
carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Because iNOS overexpression led to HIF-1a accumulation in kidney cells (24),
we sought to determine the role of iNOS in the doxorubicininduced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation in tumor cells.
Quantitative real-time PCR showed that doxorubicin signiﬁcantly enhanced iNOS transcription compared with control treatment (Fig. 5A). Western blots further conﬁrmed

that doxorubicin stimulated iNOS protein expression under
normoxic conditions (Fig. 5B). Because STAT1 is a transcription factor required for iNOS transcription and activation (25), we then sought to determine whether STAT1 is
an upstream regulator enhancing iNOS expression in
response to doxorubicin treatment. Western blots showed
that doxorubicin not only stimulated the expression of
STAT1 but also promoted STAT1 activation through the
phosphorylation of Tyr701 and Ser727 residues (Fig. 5C).
The JAK protein family member JAK2 regulates neoplasm,
blood cell development, and immune function in response
to growth factors and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. As an
upstream kinase for STAT phosphorylation, JAK2 needs to
be activated ﬁrst by phosphorylation. We conducted a
Western blot to determine whether JAK2 might be required
for the earlier STAT1 phosphorylation. Because doxorubicin
decreases total JAK2 expression and there is no JAK2
phosphorylation after doxorubicin or control treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5), JAK2 does not participate in the
doxorubicin-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation. The roles

kinases in this process merit further investigation. To
conﬁrm the importance of the STAT1–iNOS signaling pathway in doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation, we investigated whether disruption of iNOS or STAT1
would suppress doxorubicin-induced HIF-1a upregulation.
To this end, 4T1ODD-luc cells were treated with either the
iNOS-speciﬁc inhibitor 1400W or the STAT1-interfering
chemical EGCG with or without combined doxorubicin
treatment (26). Without doxorubicin, 1400W or EGCG only
suppressed the basal-level iNOS expression compared with
control treatment. When combined with doxorubicin, both
1400W and EGCG effectively suppressed doxorubicininduced iNOS upregulation in 4T1ODD-luc cells (Fig. 5D,
Supplementary Fig. S6A and 6B). Western blots further
conﬁrmed that doxorubicin-induced upregulations of STAT1
expression and activation were suppressed by EGCG (Fig.

To determine whether inhibition of iNOS could suppress
the doxorubicin-induced increase in intracellular NO synthesis, we treated 4T1ODD-luc and MCF-7 cells with doxorubicin in the presence or absence of 1400W. FACS analysis
showed that 1400W signiﬁcantly suppressed the doxorubicin-induced upregulation of NO synthesis in both cell

STAT1 could suppress the doxorubicin-induced increase in

showed that EGCG also signiﬁcantly suppressed the doxorubicin-induced upregulation of NO synthesis in both

HIF-1a accumulation. Western blots showed that 1400W
and EGCG suppressed doxorubicin-induced HIF-1a upregulation in both cell lines under normoxic conditions (Fig. 6E
and F). To verify the role of STAT1 in doxorubicin-induced
HIF-1a upregulation, we knocked down STAT1 by siRNA.
STAT1 siRNA decreased 51% of STAT1 expression and
42% of HIF-1a expression compared with the scrambled
siRNA control after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 6G and H).
This ﬁnding is consistent with the earlier result after inhibition of STAT1 by EGCG and conﬁrms that STAT1 is
important for doxorubicin-induced HIF-1a upregulation.
These results support the conclusion that doxorubicin
induces normoxic HIF-1a accumulation by activating the
STAT1–iNOS–NO–HIF-1a signaling pathway. Therefore,
STAT1 and iNOS are rational targets to suppress the upregulated HIF-1a expression in doxorubicin-treated normoxic
tumor cells. Because of the pleiotropic effects of STAT1 and
iNOS in apoptosis (27, 28), we took additional caution to
estimate the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin combined with
EGCG or 1400W against tumor cells. Compared to the initial
cell viability right before treatment, the relative cell viabilities of doxorubicin, doxorubicin þ 1400W, or doxorubicin þ

cytotoxicity against tumor cells compared to control treatment (Fig. 7A). Although there was slightly higher cell

Discussion
There has been intense interest in developing novel therapeutic strategies to target HIF-1a in cancer therapy for three
main reasons: (i) HIF-1a expression has been found in the
majority of tumors because of hypoxia, which is usually absent
in normal tissues (29). This differential expression of HIF-1a
between malignant and normal tissues allows inhibition of
HIF-1a to target cancer cells while sparing normal tissues.
(ii) Because HIF-1 is a master regulator for many aspects in
cancer biology, inhibition of HIF-1a leads to the disruption of
multiple important mechanisms for tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, and progression. (iii) Inhibition of HIF-1a may exploit
tumor hypoxia by converting it from a treatment obstacle
into a targeting advantage (30). Recent studies have shown
that many anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and hyperthermia can upregulate HIF-1a
expression in tumor cells (3, 9, 31, 32). Although these ﬁndings improved the understanding of HIF-1a stabilization
induced by other factors rather than hypoxia, very little is
known about the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on
HIF-1a expression in normoxic cancer cells. Nevertheless, it
is important to address this question, not only because HIF-1a
is a major determinant for cancer cell homeostasis under
cytotoxic stress (1, 13), but also because normoxic HIF-1a
accumulation is sufﬁcient to initiate tumor angiogenesis and
to promote cancer cell chemoresistance (14). The majority of

chemotherapeutic drugs exert most of their cytotoxic effects
on normoxic cells rather than hypoxic cells. The reduced
cytotoxicity against hypoxic tumor cells is because of multiple
mechanisms including limited penetration distance of drugs
in hypoxic tumor regions (33), a low proliferative fraction in
hypoxic tumor cell populations, and stimulated detoxiﬁcation/
chemoresistance machinery (30). Therefore, it is generally
believed that normoxic tumor cells are more sensitive to
chemotherapy than hypoxic tumor cells. However, this paradigm is true only when normoxic tumor cells are exposed to
enough high drug concentration to kill them before they
activate homeostatic, survival, and antiapoptotic signaling

pathways. Without a sufﬁciently high drug concentration
locally, even a normoxic tumor microenvironment does not
guarantee that all tumor cells are sensitive to chemotherapy,
especially when treated tumor cells activate survival molecules
such as HIF-1. To determine the effects of doxorubicin on
normoxic HIF-1a accumulation, we selected several doxorubicin concentrations in the ranges of in vivo drug concentrations in 4T1 and MCF-7 tumors (18–20). This study reveals
that surviving normoxic tumor cells are able to accumulate
HIF-1a, which promotes VEGF secretion after doxorubicin
treatment. Cell viability assay showed that 37.13% and 7.83%
of doxorubicin-treated cells survived for 48 and 72 hours

respectively after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 7A). Many studies have proven that even less than ﬁve percent of the entire
cancer cell population, when it survives, is enough to result in
cancer relapse. Because HIF-1 is a key transcriptional factor
regulating hundreds of downstream genes, identiﬁcation of key
molecular mechanisms for normoxic HIF-1a accumulation in
tumor cells during chemotherapy may provide important
insights into how tumor cells respond to chemotherapy, gain
survival advantage, and develop therapeutic resistance causing
tumor relapse. This study takes a major step toward addressing
this very important issue. The signiﬁcance of doxorubicininduced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation in tumor cells and the
underlying mechanism are explicated further.
First, we found that the STAT1–iNOS–NO–HIF-1a signaling
pathway is important for doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF1a accumulation (Fig. 7B). STAT1 is a transcription activator
for iNOS expression and NO synthesis (25). Previous studies
have shown that NO enhances the expression and activity of
HIF-1a under normoxic conditions through three mechan-

www.aacrjournals.org

isms: (i) NO inhibits prolyl hydroxylase activity to stabilize
HIF-1a (23, 34); (ii) NO S-nitrosylates the Cys533 in HIF-1a
ODD domain to prevents HIF-1a degradation (9); and (iii) NO
inhibits FIH enzyme activity to abolish the FIH-mediated
asparagine hydroxylation of HIF-1a and activates the transcription of HIF-1 downstream genes (35). The time-course
of in vivo HIF-1a upregulation in 4T1ODD-luc tumors is three
to ﬁve days after doxorubicin treatment, which overlaps
the time of HIF-1a upregulation induced by radiotherapy
(4–7 days postradiotherapy; ref. 9). Li and colleagues found
that ionizing radiation stimulated TAMs to synthesize NO.
The exogenous NO produced by TAMs then diffused into
4T1ODD-luc reporter cells and S-nitrosylated Cys533 in
HIF-1a ODD domain to stabilize HIF-1a under normoxic
conditions (9). The use of the same 4T1ODD-luc reporter cell
line allowed us to compare the NO-producing cells between
doxorubicin chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The absence
of TAMs in our in vitro study (Fig. 1 and Figs. 4–6) and the
nonsigniﬁcant difference in activated TAM fractions (TAMmarker CD68 staining) between the doxorubicin-treated
tumors and the control tumors in our in vivo study (Supplementary Fig. S7) strongly suggest that the NO synthesized in
doxorubicin-treated tumor cells is sufﬁcient to elicit normoxic
HIF-1a accumulation independent of other exogenous NOproducing cells such as TAMs. This work also shows that
doxorubicin dosages have different effects on tumor HIF-1
activity. Lee and colleagues elegantly reported that low-dose
metronomic doxorubicin therapy (1 mg/kg/day for ﬁve days)
inhibited HIF-1 transcriptional activity in tumor xenografts
(15). The dose of doxorubicin in their metronomic therapy
was only 1/10 of the single bolus MTD of doxorubicin
(10 mg/kg) in this study. Low-dose metronomic doxorubicin
therapy inhibits HIF-1 activity, whereas treatment with doxorubicin at MTD induces HIF-1. Therefore, doxorubicin may
play multiple roles to regulate HIF-1 expression and activity
depending on dosing, timing, and oxygen tensions. In addition to this mechanism, previous studies suggest that other
important mechanisms may also contribute to doxorubicininduced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation: (i) the degradation
of HIF-1a depends on HIF-PH, which requires both Fe2þ and
molecular oxygen (7, 8). When Fe2þ is removed by chelating
agents such as desferrioxamine (DFX) or substituted by Co2þ
or Ni2þ, HIF-1a degradation is inhibited. Therefore, DFX and
CoCl2 are hypoxia mimetics. Because doxorubicin is a strong
iron chelator (36), iron deﬁciency inhibits HIF-PH activity
causing normoxic HIF-1a accumulation. (ii) Sinha and colleagues elegantly showed that iron-mediated electron transfer
from doxorubicin to molecular oxygen generated free radicals/
reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 37). Many studies have
proven that free radical species and ROS upregulate HIF-1a
level (3, 32). We previously provided the ﬁrst direct in vivo
evidence showing that free radicals, ROS, and/or reactive
nitrogen species upregulate HIF-1a in tumors (3). Therefore,
doxorubicin may induce normoxic HIF-1a accumulation
through the generation of free radicals and ROS. The regulatory
mechanisms of doxorubicin on signaling pathways, cell toxicity, and metabolism are complex because of its multiple
effects on diversiﬁed molecular targets including iron

chelation, generation of free radicals/ROS, DNA binding, alkylation, and inhibition of topoisomerase II (38). Our data add
important new content to this body of knowledge – not only is
the biology relevant to tumors and to therapeutics, but also
exploitation of these ﬁndings may hold promise for other
clinical beneﬁts such as reduction of cytotoxicity to normal
tissues.
Second, this work unveils hypoxia-independent VEGF secretion and tumor angiogenesis induced by doxorubicin. Hypoxia
is one important factor for HIF-1 activation, VEGF expression,
and angiogenesis (1, 30, 39). Other nonhypoxia factors such
as radiation therapy and hyperthermia can also upregulate
HIF-1a and VEGF (3, 9, 32). VEGF stimulates tumor growth
by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (40, 41) because
VEGF is not only a potent proangiogenic factor for tumor
endothelial cells but also a key survival factor for tumor cells
including 4T1 and MCF-7 cells (40, 42). Here, we show that
doxorubicin enhances VEGF secretion in surviving normoxic
tumor cells and stimulates posttreatment tumor angiogenesis
by activating the STAT1–iNOS–NO–HIF-1a–VEGF signaling
pathway (Fig. 7B), which is different from those mechanisms
underlying HIF-1a upregulation induced by radiotherapy
or hyperthermia (9, 32, 43). These new ﬁndings also suggest
the importance of combining conventional chemotherapy
such as doxorubicin with anti-VEGF/antiangiogenic therapy
to inhibit tumor VEGF secretion and angiogenesis not
only caused by hypoxia, but also induced by doxorubicin
chemotherapy.
Third, our data indicate that the p53 tumor-suppressor
gene may not be required in doxorubicin-induced activation
of the STAT1–iNOS–NO–HIF-1a signaling pathway. P53 mutation is the most common genetic lesion in human cancers. In
a previous clinical study, Yamaguchi and colleagues showed
that iNOS expression was signiﬁcantly correlated with tumor
progression by stimulating angiogenesis and there was no
correlation between iNOS and P53 expression (44). The
4T1ODD-luc cell line is p53 null, whereas MCF-7 expresses
wild-type p53 (45, 46). The HIF-1a upregulation in both
p53-null and p53 wild-type tumor cell lines indicates that
P53 tumor suppressor might not be necessary for doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation (Fig. 1C). In addition, the successful suppression of HIF-1a upregulation by
EGCG or 1400W in both cell lines suggests that the STAT1- or
iNOS-targeting strategy does not depend on wild-type P53
expression (Fig. 6E and F). Therefore, doxorubicin chemotherapy combined with STAT1 or iNOS inhibitors might be
used to treat both p53 wild-type and p53-mutant tumors.
Finally, our ﬁndings raise thought-provoking questions
with regard to chemoresistance. STAT1 is associated with
acquired resistance to doxorubicin (47). However, the
molecular mechanism of STAT1-related therapeutic resistance has not been well understood. Unveiling the activation
of the STAT1–iNOS–NO signaling pathway in doxorubicininduced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation may provide
new insight into the roles of STAT1 in chemoresistance.
Muerkoster and colleagues found that pancreatic cancer
cells acquired chemoresistance when treated with the
low-dose chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. Etoposide sti-

6240

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

mulates intracellular synthesis of NO, which inactivates
caspases causing chemoresistance (48). Inhibition of iNOS
by 1400W rescues caspase activity and enhances tumor
cell chemosensitivity (48). Therefore, iNOS is a key determinant for acquired chemoresistance. Here, we discovered
that doxorubicin also upregulates iNOS expression and
intracellular NO levels (Figs. 5 and 6). Together with
Muerkoster's ﬁndings, it appears that different types of
tumor cells may share this iNOS–NO pathway in response
to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and etoposide. Because both doxorubicin and etoposide inhibit topoisomerase II, it is worthwhile to further investigate whether
this pathway is a common tumor response to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, we found
that 1400W suppressed the expression and activation of
STAT1 (Fig. 5E). One potential possibility might be that
1400W inhibited iNOS and lowered intracellular NO levels,
thereby restoring caspase activity in a similar manner as that
found in Muerkoster's study (48). The restored caspase
activity and apoptosis after 1400W treatment might suppress the expression and activation of STAT1. The other
potential possibility is based on the ﬁnding that NO stimulates STAT1 activation (49). Therefore, the iNOS-speciﬁc
inhibitor 1400W might attenuate STAT1 activation by suppressing intracellular NO synthesis. It would be intriguing
to distinguish and verify the above two hypotheses in future.
The mechanistic elucidation of doxorubicin-induced normoxic HIF-1a accumulation signiﬁcantly advances understanding of tumor response to cytotoxic drugs, which may
help to optimize conventional chemotherapy by the use of
HIF-1 inhibitors. This therapeutic strategy is supported by a
recent study of Zhang and colleagues showing that combined
therapy with HIF-1 inhibitor and doxorubicin achieves significantly improved tumor control (50). With regard to clinical
signiﬁcance, this study suggests that combination chemotherapy with HIF-1a inhibition and doxorubicin would target
not only hypoxic tumor cells but also the heretofore overlooked normoxic tumor cells.
