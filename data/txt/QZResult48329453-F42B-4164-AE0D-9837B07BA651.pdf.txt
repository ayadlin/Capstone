Abstract
Emerging evidence has highlighted the host immune system
in modulating the patient response to chemotherapy, but the
mechanism of this modulation remains unclear. The aim of this
study was to analyze the effect of chemotherapy on antitumor
immunity in the tumor microenvironment of ovarian cancer.
Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with various chemotherapeutic agents resulted in upregulated expression of MHC
class I and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a
NF-kB–dependent manner and suppression of antigen-speciﬁc
T-cell function in vitro. In a mouse model of ovarian cancer,
treatment with paclitaxel increased CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration into

the tumor site, upregulated PD-L1 expression, and activated
NF-kB signaling. In particular, tumor-bearing mice treated with
a combination of paclitaxel and a PD-L1/PD-1 signal blockade
survived longer than mice treated with paclitaxel alone. In
summary, we found that chemotherapy induces local immune
suppression in ovarian cancer through NF-kB–mediated PD-L1
upregulation. Thus, a combination of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling axis may
improve the antitumor response and offers a promising new
treatment modality against ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 75(23);

Introduction

toxicity (5). However, recent reports have shown that several
chemotherapeutic drugs altered the local immune state, affecting
the response of the tumor to treatment (6–9). Several commonly
used chemotherapeutic agents, including those commonly used
for ovarian cancer such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine, induce
immunoreactive effects such as promotion of tumor antigen
presentation through upregulating the expression of tumor antigens or MHC class I molecules (10, 11). Other agents decrease
the number of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory
T cells or myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), thereby
increasing helper T-cell accumulation at the tumor site (7, 8).
On the other hand, some chemotherapeutic agents lead to local
immunosuppression via induction of a speciﬁc inﬂammasome,
promoting tumor growth (12). Thus, it is unclear whether or not
chemotherapeutic agents exert an immunoreactive effect on the
tumor microenvironment.
Recent studies have revealed that tumor cells acquire several
ways to escape the host immune attack in the tumor microenvironment; these constitute the cancer immune escape system (13–15). One of the most important components of this
system is an immune checkpoint signal, the programmed
death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis (16). PD-1 is
mainly expressed by activated T cells, whereas PD-L1 is frequently expressed on tumor cells (17–19). Inhibition of PD-1/
PD-L1 interaction enhances the T-cell response and mediates
dramatic preclinical antitumor activity in patients with melanoma, renal cell cancer, and non–small cell lung cancer
(17, 20–22). We previously reported that PD-L1 expression is
associated with poorer prognosis in ovarian cancer patients

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy
worldwide and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related
death in women, because more than 75% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage (stage III or IV; refs. 1, 2).
Although taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapies are effective in the treatment of the majority of ovarian cancer cases, more
than 70% of patients suffer from recurrence and eventually
develop chemoresistance (3). Considering the high mortality rate
of ovarian cancer due to the absence of curative treatment for
advanced stage or recurrent disease, new therapeutic modalities,
including immunotherapy to complement chemotherapy, are
urgently needed (4).
Anticancer chemotherapeutic agents have long been known to
induce systemic immunosuppressive effects due to bone marrow

Chemotherapy Induces PD-L1 Overexpression in Ovarian Cancer

(23) and promotes peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer
via host immunosuppression (24). However, it is not clear how
chemotherapeutic agents affect local immune status, including
PD-1/PD-L1 signaling.
Herein, we investigate the molecular mechanism of chemotherapy-induced PD-L1 expression in human ovarian cancer cells
and determine whether inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 signal
increases the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy in a syngenic mouse
ovarian cancer model.

Materials and Methods
Microarray analysis
We analyzed four publicly available gene expression microarray datasets: GSE15622 (25), from clinical ovarian cancer
samples collected before and after chemotherapy (paclitaxel,
n ¼ 20; carboplatin, CBDCA, n ¼ 14); GSE18728 (26), from
clinical breast cancer samples pre- and post-docetaxel and capecitabine (n ¼ 14); GSE13525 (27), from human ovarian cancer
cell line 36M2 treated with CBDCA and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) for 1,037 human tumor cell lines (28). Pathway
analysis of these microarray data before and after chemotherapy
was performed using Gene Annotation Tool to Help Explain
Relationships (GATHER; ref. 29).
The NF-kB gene expression signature that includes eight genes
(CCRN4L, CREB3L2, GAA, HIP1, HSPA5, KLF6, NFKBIZ, and
SURF4) has been implemented in a previous study (30). An
NF-kB signature score was calculated for each sample before and
after chemotherapy using single sample Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (ssGSEA; ref. 31).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining and counting of immune cells
were performed as previously described (23, 32). Brieﬂy, for
human CD8 staining, parafﬁn-embedded sections were ﬁrst
stained with mouse anti-human CD8 monoclonal antibody. For
mouse immunohistochemistry, peritoneal tumor cryosections
were stained with rat anti-mouse CD4, rat anti-mouse CD8, goat
anti-mouse PD-L1, anti–NF-kB p65, or anti-mouse Gr-1. The
numbers of CD4þ, CD8þ, and Gr-1þ cells at the tumor site were
counted in a microscopic ﬁeld at 200 magniﬁcation. Detailed
information is provided in Supplementary Data.
Evaluation of PD-L1 expression on human ovarian cancer cells
from ascites
Ascites ﬂuid from an ovarian cancer patient was collected
before and after chemotherapy (paclitaxel and CBDCA; days 4
and 11). These cells were harvested and incubated with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human PD-L1 antibody. EpCAMpositive (FITC-labeled anti-human CD326 clone 9C4; Biolegend) and 7-AAD–negative gated cells were scored as ovarian
ascites tumor cells by ﬂow cytometry.
Cell lines
The ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cell line was kindly provided
by Dr. Margit Maria Janat-Amsbury from the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Gynecologic Oncology,
Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX; ref. 24). The OV2944HM-1 (HM-1) mouse ovarian cancer cell line was purchased
from RIKEN BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Japan; ref. 32). Human
ovarian cancer cell lines (ovary1847, SK-OV-3 and OVCAR8) were

www.aacrjournals.org

provided by Dr. Susan K. Murphy from the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology, Duke University (Durham, NC;
ref. 33). RMGII were gifted by Dr. Daisuke Aoki from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Keio University (Tokyo,
Japan; ref. 33). And all these cells were authenticated and were
passaged fewer than 6 months after purchase or giving for all the
experiments as previously described (33).
Chemotherapeutic agents
Gemcitabine (Eli Lilly Japan K.K.; 24 mmol/L, 120 mmol/L,
600 mmol/L), paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers K.K.; 2, 10, 20 mmol/L),
CBDCA (Bristol-Myers K.K.; 20, 100, 500 mmol/L), CPA (Shionogi
& Co., Ltd.; 0.7, 7, 70 mmol/L), or PBS were added to mouse
cell lines ID8 and HM-1 for 24 hours and further monitored for
an additional 9, 12, 24, 48 hours. Human cell lines ovary1847 and
SK-OV-3 were treated with gemcitabine (24, 120, 600 mmol/L),
paclitaxel (2, 10, 20 mmol/L) for 24 hours. RMGII and OVCAR8
were also treated with gemcitabine (120 mmol/L), paclitaxel
(10 mmol/L) for 24 hours
Flow cytometry
We used phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti–PD-L1 antibody,
PE-conjugated anti-mouse MHC class I antibody, PE-conjugated
anti-mouse IFNg receptor 1 (IFNGR1) antibody, PE-conjugated
anti-mouse PD-1 antibody, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4
antibody or AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 antibody. Detailed information is provided in Supplementary Data.
Biochemical and molecular biologic techniques
Western blotting, RT-PCR, knockdown of NF-kB p65 (Rela) or
Ifngr1 expression in cells, generation of ID8OVA cells, cytotoxicity
assays for ID8OVA cells and CD107aþ expression assays are
described in Supplementary Data.
Mice
Female C57BL/6 (B6) and B6C3F1 mice were purchased from
CLEA Japan. OVA-speciﬁc T-cell receptor transgenic mice (OT-1
mice) and CAG-GFP mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory and were interbred to generate OT-1-GFP mice. Animal experiments were approved by the Kyoto University Animal
Research Committee.
Evaluation of PD-L1 depletion in tumor cells during
chemotherapy in a mouse ovarian cancer model
A Pdl1-overexpressing cell line (ID8-pdl1), Pdl1-depleted
cell line (ID8Mirpdl1; ID8-pdl1 KO), and sequence control cell
line (ID8MirControl; ID8-conrol) were generated as previously
described (24). Following intraperitoneal injection of ID8-control, ID8-pdl1KO, or ID8-pdl1 (5  106 cells each) into syngenic
mice, 8 mg/kg paclitaxel or saline was injected into the peritoneal
cavities on days 14, 21, 28, and 35 after tumor implantation
(each group, n ¼ 12). Mice were euthanized before reaching the
moribund state. This study was repeated using four 150 mg/kg
gemcitabine injections in place of paclitaxel.
Combination treatment with anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1
antibody and chemotherapy in a mouse ovarian cancer model
Mice (C57BL/6) were injected intraperitoneally with 5  106
ID8OVA cells. Paclitaxel (8 mg/kg) or saline was administered
intraperitoneally on days 14, 21, 28, and 35 after tumor

implantation. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg
of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided
by Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan,) or mouse IgG
(clone MOPC 21; BioXcell) weekly on days 16, 23, 30, and 37.
This study was repeated using six injections of 150 mg/kg
gemcitabine (on days 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 after tumor
implantation) in place of paclitaxel and six injections of
10 mg/kg of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody (on days
16, 23, 30, 37, 44, and 51 after tumor implantation). In place
of anti–PD-1 antibody, we also treated mice with 200 mg of
rat anti–PD-L1 antibody (aPD-L1, clone 10F.9G2; BioLegend)
alone, the combination of paclitaxel and aPD-L1, or saline and
IgG2bk (clone RTK4530; BioLegend) by intraperitoneal injection (control; each group, n ¼ 8) on the same schedule as the anti–
PD-1 antibody therapy. Survival analysis was performed by the
Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank test.
Cytotoxicity assay
As effector cells, activated OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells were
prepared as previously described (24). As target cells, Pdl1-depleted cells treated with paclitaxel (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours (paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-pdl1 KO), control cells treated with paclitaxel (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours (paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-conrol),
control cells without paclitaxel treatment (ID8-control). Then,
cells were loaded with 10 mg/mL OVA257–264 peptide (Bachem
Bioscience) at 37 C for 1 hour, without OVA loading as a negative
control (ID8-control without OVA loading). ID8-control, paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-control, paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-pdl1KO,
or ID8-control without OVA loading were cocultured with activated OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells at several effector-to-target (E:T)
ratios. After 4 hours of coincubation, the LDH in the coculture
supernatant was detected with a nonradioactive cytotoxicity kit,
CytoTox96 (Promega). Cytotoxicity for each E:T cell ratio was
calculated as previously described (24).
Statistical analysis
The Student t test, paired t test or ANOVA was performed for
the analysis of immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and
microarray data. The Kaplan–Meier curves and the log rank test
were generated using GraphPad Prism 4 software. All P values
< 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Chemotherapeutic agents alter the immunologic
microenvironment in ovarian cancer
To evaluate the chemotherapeutic effect on the ovarian cancer
microenvironment, we analyzed a microarray dataset, GSE15622,
and found that in the top 100 pathways, 11 of apoptosis/cell
death–related pathways, 9 of immune-related pathways, and 3 of
NF-kB-related pathways were upregulated following administration of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or CBDCA; Supplementary
Table S1). Therefore, we suggest that chemotherapy (paclitaxel
or CBDCA) leads not only to apoptotic cell death but also to an
immune reaction with NF-kB signal activation in the ovarian
cancer microenvironment.
We also found that expression of CD8 and HLA-B was
upregulated not only in paclitaxel-treated samples but also in
CBDCA-treated samples in the same GSE15622 microarray
dataset (Fig. 1A and B), whereas CD4 was upregulated only
in paclitaxel-treated samples in this dataset (Fig. 1C). To

5036 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

conﬁrm NF-kB signal activation in this dataset, we used ssGSEA
to apply a previously established NF-kB signature (23, 24) to
the paclitaxel- or CBDCA-treated data in GSE15622; NF-kB
signaling was indeed signiﬁcantly upregulated (Fig. 1D).
To conﬁrm that the number of CD8þ TILs increases after
chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients we performed immunohistochemistry using an anti-CD8 antibody. We determined
that the number of CD8þ TILs in ovarian cancer tissues from
21 patients was signiﬁcantly increased after chemotherapy
(Fig. 1E; Supplementary Table S2; CD8þ TILs count, 12.6 
19.7–20.6  23.5; P ¼ 0.039). Clinicopathologic features are
shown in Supplementary Table S2.
Next, we evaluated whether overexpression of PD-L1 on
ovarian cancer cells after chemotherapy in ovarian cancer
patients was evident, because we previously reported that the
expansion of CD8þ TILs was closely related to the amount of
PD-L1 signaling by ovarian cancer cells (23). We collected
cancer cells from massive ascites of a stage IIIc ovarian cancer
patient both before and after (days 4 and 11) paclitaxel plus
CBDCA chemotherapy at Kyoto University Hospital. PD-L1
expression was about 5-fold higher on day 4 than before
chemotherapy. On day 11, however, PD-L1 expression had
decreased to levels that were similar to those before chemotherapy (Fig. 1F). Therefore, the induction of PD-L1 expression
by chemotherapy was reversible with or without continuous
treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.
Chemotherapeutic agents induce NF-kB p65 and MHC class I
expression
To conﬁrm the microarray results for dataset GSE15622
showing overexpression of NF-kB p65 and MHC class I expression in clinical samples after chemotherapy, we incubated
mouse ovarian cancer cell lines ID8 and HM-1 for 24 hours
at several doses of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, CBDCA, or CPA. We
found that NF-kB p65 protein expression in ID8 and HM-1 was
signiﬁcantly induced with treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Treatment of
human ovarian cancer cell lines (ovary1847, SK-OV-3, RMGII,
and OVCAR8) with gemcitabine or paclitaxel also signiﬁcantly
induced total cellular NF-kB p65 protein (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3).
MHC class I expression was induced approximately 2-fold
in mouse ovarian cancer cell lines ID8 or HM-1 after incubation with chemotherapeutic agents (gemcitabine, paclitaxel,
or CBDCA; Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similarly,
increased MHC class I protein was evident in human ovarian
cancer cell lines ovary1847 and SK-OV3 treated with gemcitabine or paclitaxel in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4B). MHC class I protein was also
increased in human ovarian cancer cell lines RMGII and
OVCAR8 treated with gemcitabine or paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
PD-L1 expression is modulated by chemotherapeutic agents
To determine whether PD-L1 expression is modulated by
chemotherapeutic agents, we analyzed publicly available microarray dataset GSE13525 and found that PD-L1 mRNA expression
is signiﬁcantly induced in human ovarian cancer cell line 36M2
when incubated with CBDCA for 36 hours (Fig. 3A). In addition,
analysis of a second dataset, GSE18728, showed that PD-L1
mRNA was elevated in breast cancer tissue from patients who

received docetaxel and capecitabine combination chemotherapy
(Supplementary Fig. S5; P ¼ 0.002).
To conﬁrm PD-L1 induction by chemotherapeutic agents in
cancer cells, we treated ID8 or HM-1 with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or CBDCA for 0, 9, 24, and 48 hours. PD-L1 mRNA
expression was signiﬁcantly elevated in ID8 following incubation with gemcitabine in as little as 9 hours. There was a 3- to
4-fold induction of PD-L1 mRNAs in ID8 and HM-1 cells after
24 hours incubation with each chemotherapeutic agent (Fig.
3B). Treatment of ID8 or HM-1 cell lines with gemcitabine,
paclitaxel, and CBDCA resulted in a 6- to 10-fold induction of
cell surface PD-L1 protein expression (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Total PD-L1 protein expression in ID8 and HM-1
was induced in a dose- dependent manner when these cells were
incubated with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, CBDCA, capecitabine, or
IFNg (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S6B–S6D).
Similarly, a 1.5- to 5-fold increase in surface PD-L1 protein was

observed in human ovarian cancer cell lines ovary1847,
SK-OV-3, RMGII, and OVCAR8 treated with gemcitabine or
paclitaxel (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). A
signiﬁcant increased total cellular PD-L1 is evident in RMGII and
OVCAR8 treated with gemcitabine or paclitaxel (Supplementary
Fig. S7C). An escalation of total cellular PD-L1 levels in ovary1847 or SK-OV-3 that was related with the treatment dose was
evident (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Figs. S3 and S7D).
To evaluate the effect of chemotherapeutic treatment duration
on PD-L1 induction, ID8 cells were treated with gemcitabine,
paclitaxel or IFNg for 24 hours, then incubated with drug-free
medium for an additional 1, 2, 5, or 15 days. PD-L1 mRNA was
induced after 1 day incubation with drug-free medium for gemcitabine -, paclitaxel -, and IFNg (as a positive control; ref. 24)
pretreated ID8 cells. However, after 2 days, PD-L1 mRNA expression was not detected in IFNg-pretreated ID8 cells. PD-L1 was
observed in paclitaxel or gemcitabine-pretreated ID8 cells until

day 5, but not at day 15 (Fig. 3G). Therefore, the mechanism
by which PD-L1 expression is induced by chemotherapeutic
agents in ovarian cancer cells might differ from the way it is induced by IFNg.

Chemotherapeutic agents upregulate PD-L1 and MHC class I via
NF-kB signaling
To evaluate the relationship between gene expression of
PD-L1 and MHC class I and NF-kB signaling, we ﬁrst analyzed
microarray data from 1,037 human malignant cell lines from the
CCLE and found that the NF-kB gene signature score was significantly positively correlated with mRNA expression levels of HLAA, HLA-B, HLA-C, and PD-L1 (Fig. 4A). To conﬁrm these relationships, we analyzed ID8 or HM-1 cells transduced with Rela shRNA
or control shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S8) and found that MHC
class I expression in ID8shNF-kB (Rela69 knockdown) cell lines
was not increased by administration of gemcitabine or paclitaxel
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S9). In human ovarian cancer
cells (ovary1847, SK-OV-3, and OVCAR8), we found that MHC
class I was similarly not elevated by gemcitabine or paclitaxel
treatment when NF-kB p65 knockdown was achieved using NF-

kB p65 siRNA, whereas it was elevated in control siRNA cell lines
(Fig. 4C and Supplementary Figs. S10A–S10C and S11).
We then generated ID8 and HM-1 cells transfected with control siRNA or NF-kB p65 siRNA targeting the Rela gene. We
found that knockdown of NF-kB p65 in ID8 and HM-1 cell lines
impaired PD-L1 induction by gemcitabine or paclitaxel (Fig. 4D
and Supplementary Figs. S12A–S12B and S13). As expected,
PD-L1 expression in the Rela knockdown cell lines (ID8shRela69
or 70, HM1shRela69 or 70) was not elevated after incubation
with gemcitabine or paclitaxel (Fig. 4E and Supplementary
Figs. S12C and S14), whereas it was elevated in control shRNA
cell lines (ID8 shControl or HM-1shControl).
We conﬁrmed that PD-L1 protein was not elevated by either
gemcitabine or paclitaxel treatment in NF-kB p65 knockdown
human cell lines, ovary1847, SK-OV-3, and OVCAR8 (Fig. 4F and
Supplementary Figs. S10A, S10B, S10D, and S11).
PD-L1 and MHC class I expression is induced by

receptor 1 (IFNGR1) shRNA (ID8shControl or ID8shIfgr1)
were treated with gemcitabine or paclitaxel (Supplementary
Fig. S15). We found that PD-L1 and NF-kB p65 were upregulated by chemotherapeutic agent treatment, even in the IFNGR1
knockdown cell line (ID8shIfgr1; Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S16). IFNg signiﬁcantly induced PD-L1, but this
effect was partially abrogated in the IFNGR1 knockdown cell
line (ID8shIfgr1; Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S16).

we clearly demonstrated that the induction of both PD-L1
and MHC class I following treatment with chemotherapeutic
agents is affected by the NF-kB signaling pathway, even in the
absence of the IFNg signaling pathway.

injected intraperitoneally with 5  106 ID8 ovarian cancer
cells to establish a peritoneal disseminated tumor model.
Paclitaxel was administered to a subset of mice by intraperitoneal injection. Both PD-L1 and NF-kB p65 were overexpressed
in these tumor cells (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table S3). Paclitaxel treatment signiﬁcantly increased the number of CD8þ
and CD4þ T cells in the ID8 peritoneal tumors (Fig. 6A;
Supplementary Table S4). Administration of gemcitabine also
increased PD-L1 and NF-kB p65 expression, as well as CD8þ
and CD4þ TIL numbers in ID8 tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. S17; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These
data clearly demonstrate that both paclitaxel and gemcitabine
induce an immunosuppressive state in vivo, while they simul-

We next assessed alterations in CD8þ TILs (CTL) following
their encounter with paclitaxel-induced PD-L1 using cytotoxicity
assay and CD107a degranulation assay. Following coculture
with CD8þ T cells, paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-control cells show
a lower lysis percentage than nonpretreated ID8-control cells,
indicating that T-cell activation may be inhibited by paclitaxel
(Fig. 6B; P ¼ 0.0001). Next, paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-pdl1KO,

stimulation when PD-L1 is knocked down (Fig. 6B; P ¼ 0.0001).
Similarly, there were fewer CD107aþ CD8þ T cells following
coculture with paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-control than with nonpretreated ID8-control, suggesting that T-cell activation may be
inhibited by paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S17B; P ¼ 0.011).
Next, the number of CD107aþ CD8þ T cells signiﬁcantly
increased when they were cocultured with paclitaxel-pretreated
ID8-pdl1KO instead of paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-control (Supplementary Fig. S17B; P ¼ 0.004). This suggests that depletion of
PD-L1 in ovarian cancer cells induces activation of CD8þ T cells.
Finally, the number of CD107aþ CD8þ T cells following coculture
with paclitaxel-pretreated ID8-pd1KO decreased when they
cocultured with nontreated ID8-control, indicating that PD-L1
knockout facilitate T cells activated by paclitaxel (Supplementary
Fig. S17B; P ¼ 0.046). Collectively, paclitaxel -induced overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor cells could be a mechanism of
immune evasion from CD8þ T cells in ovarian cancer.

taxel administration signiﬁcantly improved prognosis of the
other groups (Fig. 6C; P < 0.05). ID8-control tumor-bearing
mice treated with paclitaxel and ID8-pdl1KO tumor-bearing
mice who did not receive paclitaxel had moderate survival,
whereas ID8-pdl1KO tumor-bearing mice receiving paclitaxel
had the best survival among the six groups (Fig. 6C; P < 0.05).
In vitro data showed that expression of both PD-L1 and NF-kB
p65 was upregulated in ID8-control or ID8-pdl1 incubated
with paclitaxel or gemcitabine. In contrast, PD-L1 mRNA and
protein were not upregulated in the pdl1-depleted cell line
after incubation with paclitaxel or gemcitabine, even though
NF-kB p65 was elevated (Supplementary Fig. S18). Thus, PD-L1
depletion effectively eliminates PD-L1 overexpression induced
by paclitaxel. However, in contrast to paclitaxel, gemcitabine
treatment combined with PD-L1 depletion did not improve
prognosis in the mouse model as compared with gemcitabine
treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. S19A; P ¼ 0.087).

Paclitaxel combined with PD-L1 depletion prolongs mouse
survival
In addition, we evaluated whether blocking PD-L1 in tumor
cells reversed the decline in T-cell immunity and promoted
tumor rejection after chemotherapy in a mouse ovarian cancer
model. We examined survival in syngeneic mice with or without intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel following establishment of intraperitoneal tumors using ID8-control, ID8pdl1KO, or ID8-pdl1. ID8-pdl1 tumor-bearing mice without
paclitaxel treatment had the worst prognosis, whereas pacli-

combined treatment of paclitaxel with aPD-1 showed signiﬁcantly better survival than those receiving monotherapy with
paclitaxel (P ¼ 0.004) or aPD-1 (P < 0.0001). In place of anti–
PD-1 antibody, we also treated mice with aPD-L1 and found
that the combined treatment of paclitaxel with aPD-L1 also
resulted in the best survival (Fig. 6E; P < 0.0001). ID8 tumorbearing mice that received the combined treatment of paclitaxel
with aPD-L1 also showed signiﬁcantly better survival than
those receiving monotherapy with paclitaxel or aPD-L1 (P <
0.0001, each).
Consistent with our previous in vivo experiment (Fig. 6A),
paclitaxel treatment again increased CD8þ and CD4þ TIL cell
percentage at the tumor site in this in vivo experiment (Supplementary Fig. S21A andS21B). Moreover, combined therapy
enhanced paclitaxel -induced immune activation not only by

5042 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

increasing the number of CD8þ and CD4þ TILs, but also by
decreasing the PD-1þ TIL percentage (Supplementary Fig. S21).
This suggests that combined therapy with anti–PD-1 or anti–PDL1 antibody and paclitaxel might induce tumor regression by
attenuating the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 signal to
achieve maximal immune activation. Therefore, we propose a
model for immunologic changes in ovarian cancer cells with
chemotherapy, upregulating PD-L1 and MHC class I via a mechanism dependent on NF-kB p65 (Fig. 6F). However, similar to the
results from our in vivo study (Supplementary Fig. S19A), gemcitabine plus aPD-1 does not improve survival as compared with
gemcitabine treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. S19B). Moreover, gemcitabine but not paclitaxel decreases the number of
MDSCs in tumor site (Supplementary Fig. S22; Supplementary
Table S4).

Chemotherapy Induces PD-L1 Overexpression in Ovarian Cancer

Discussion
In this study, chemotherapeutic agents commonly used for
ovarian cancer enhanced both immunogenicity of tumor cells
and immunosuppressive changes at the tumor site. First, we
found that paclitaxel and CBDCA led to overexpression of MHC
class I on tumor cells and increased CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration at
the tumor site in the clinical setting (Fig. 1). These data were
conﬁrmed in a mouse intraperitoneal ovarian cancer model
when tumor-bearing mice were treated with paclitaxel or gemcitabine (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S21). These ﬁndings are
consistent with previous reports (34–36). Second, we demonstrated that the immunosuppressive cosignaling molecule
PD-L1 was overexpressed on human and mouse ovarian cancer
cells following treatment with several chemotherapeutic agents
in a dose-dependent manner (Figs 1 and 3) and in a mouse
ovarian cancer model (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S19).
These ﬁndings suggest a complicated immunologic status at the
tumor site following chemotherapy and are consistent with
previous studies (34–36). Third, a cytotoxicity assay and
CD107a CTL assays revealed that paclitaxel inhibits the function
of CD8þ T cells despite leading to increased numbers of CD8þ
TILs in the in vivo mouse model (Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary Fig. S17B) and in the clinical setting (Fig. 1E), whereas
paclitaxel activates CD8þ T-cell function when PD-L1 is depleted. Finally, we determined that these contradictory phenomena, including immunoreactivation and immunosuppression
in ovarian cancer after chemotherapy, were connected through
NF-kB signaling induced by chemotherapy.
NF-kB functions in cancer cells as a transcription factor and
is related to tumor progression via its inﬂuence on prevention
of apoptosis and enhancement of cell proliferation (37, 38).
In prior reports, NF-kB signal activation led to chemotherapeutic resistance in gastric, pancreatic, and lung cancer cells via
the AKT-IkB pathway (39–42). Consistent with these reports,
we conﬁrmed that several chemotherapeutic drugs also induce
NF-kB signaling in ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent
manner in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2A and B). As a relationship
between NF-kB signaling and MHC class I expression was
demonstrated in neuroblastoma (43), we also found that
NF-kB signaling induced overexpression of MHC class I on
ovarian cancer cells in the absence of IFNg signaling caused by
chemotherapy (Fig. 5). We are the ﬁrst to report that chemotherapy upregulates MHC class I via NF-kB signaling as well as
the molecular mechanism.
In addition, we demonstrated that NF-kB signaling induces
overexpression of PD-L1 in ovarian cancer cells and this lead to
immunosuppressive changes at the tumor site following chemotherapy (Fig. 4). Two prior studies identiﬁed a relationship
between NF-kB and PD-L1. NF-kB signaling was shown to induce
PD-L1 expression through binding of a PD-L1 promoter motif
during the active phase of monocytes (44, 45). Other studies
showed that PD-L1 induction resulted from PTEN loss or MEK
activation in glioma or myeloma (46, 47), and from IFNg in
melanoma and plasma cell of multiple myeloma (47, 48). We
previously showed that PD-L1 overexpression is induced by IFNg
produced by activated T cells in tumor ascites and that this
promotes peritoneal dissemination in ovarian cancer (24). Therefore, to determine the function of the NF-kB or IFNg signal during
chemotherapy, we generated the NF-kB p65 or IFNg receptor
knockout cells in this study, which revealed that chemotherapy for

ovarian cancer leads to overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor cells in
the absence of IFNg signaling (Fig. 5). This is the ﬁrst report to
show that chemotherapeutic agents upregulate PD-L1 via NF-kB
signaling.
We selected paclitaxel and gemcitabine for our in vivo experiments because they are commonly used to treat ovarian cancer
as a part of ﬁrst-line (paclitaxel) and second-line (gemcitabine)
conventional therapies. They have also been reported as immunogenic drugs that promote antigen presentation, increase
CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration into the tumor and inhibit immunosuppressive T cells (32–34). Thus, on the basis of several prior
reports, paclitaxel and gemcitabine were anticipated to be good
candidates for combining with immunotherapy (49, 34). In
fact, we found that these chemotherapeutic agents induced
overexpression of PD-L1 and were the ﬁrst to show that paclitaxel combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade treatment enhances antitumor effects relative to monotherapy in both the
in vitro and in vivo systems (Fig. 6). And CBDCA, another part of
ﬁrst-line therapy with paclitaxel, also enhanced expression of
PD-L1 on ovarian cancer cells so that anti–PD-1 antibody may
be a good enhancer of conventional ﬁrst line chemotherapy for
ovarian cancer. Since 2011, we have opened a medical investigator–initiated phase II clinical trial with fully humanized
anti–PD-1 antibody (Nivolumab) for platinum-resistant ovarian cancers (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: UMIN000005714)
and we have demonstrated safety and shown efﬁcacy of the
anti–PD-1 antibody in patients (50). From our experience,
combined chemoimmune therapy with paclitaxel and anti–
PD-1 antibody may offer promise as a new treatment strategy
for ovarian cancers (Fig. 6E).
On the other hand, gemcitabine did not augment the antitumor
effect of anti–PD-1 antibody treatment in vivo (Supplementary
Fig. S19). Both paclitaxel and gemcitabine together induced CD8þ
T-cell inﬁltration at the tumor site and upregulated PD-L1 expression in vitro. The reason for the difference in antitumor response
between paclitaxel and gemcitabine seems partially due to the
different immunogenic changes caused by each agent. Gemcitabine is known to decrease immunosuppressive cells such as
MDSCs (34). Consistent with this report, we conﬁrmed that
gemcitabine decreased the number of MDSCs at the tumor site
in the mouse ovarian cancer model, while paclitaxel did not
(Supplementary Fig. S22). However, other unidentiﬁed mechanisms may also contribute to the lack of additional antitumor
effects with combined gemcitabine and PD-1 signal blocking.
In addition, we were the ﬁrst to reveal that PD-L1 expression
induced via NF-kB or IFNg pathway signaling is not persistent in
tumor cells but rather is transient. PD-L1 induction lasted less
than 2 days via the IFNg pathway, while it was extended to more
than 5 days via NF-kB treatment was stopped in vitro (Fig. 3G).
In vivo, PD-L1þ cancer cells were detected and increased in ascites
from an advanced ovarian cancer patient treated with paclitaxel
and carboplatin chemotherapy after 4 days, but were decreased
after 11 days. Therefore, the maximum antitumor effect of combined therapy with paclitaxel and the anti–PD-1 antibody may be
dependent on speciﬁc timing of treatments.
In conclusion, we found that chemotherapy induced several
immunologic changes in ovarian cancers, including MHC class I
and PD-L1 upregulation via NF-kB signaling. Thus, chemoimmunotherapy with paclitaxel and anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 antibody may offer a novel and effective approach for future treatment
strategies.
