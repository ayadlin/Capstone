Abstract
In solid tumors, angiogenesis occurs in the setting of a defective vasculature and impaired lymphatic drainage
that is associated with increased vascular permeability and enhanced tumor permeability. These universal
aspects of the tumor microenvironment can have a marked inﬂuence on intratumoral drug delivery that may
often be underappreciated. In this study, we investigated the effect of blood vessel normalization in tumors by the
antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab on antibody uptake by tumors. In mouse xenograft models of human ovarian
and esophageal cancer (SKOV-3 and OE19), we evaluated antibody uptake in tumors by positron emission
tomographic imaging 24 and 144 hours after injection of 89Zr-trastuzumab (SKOV-3 and OE19), 89Zr-bevacizumab (SKOV-3), or 89Zr-IgG (SKOV-3) before or after treatment with bevacizumab. Intratumor distribution was
assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy along with mean vessel density (MVD) and vessel normalization. Notably,
bevacizumab treatment decreased tumor uptake and intratumoral accumulation compared with baseline in the
tumor models relative to controls. Bevacizumab treatment also reduced MVD in tumors and increased vessel
pericyte coverage. These ﬁndings are clinically important, suggesting caution in designing combinatorial trials
with therapeutic antibodies due to a possible reduction in tumoral accumulation that may be caused by
bevacizumab cotreatment. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3347–55. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is one of
the hallmarks of cancer and is therefore an anticancer drug
target (1, 2). In solid tumors, extensive angiogenesis is accompanied by defective vascular architecture, leading to increased
vascular permeability, hypoxia, low pH, and high interstitial
ﬂuid pressure. Several preclinical and clinical studies indicate
that antiangiogenic drugs, including the anti-VEGF-A antibody
bevacizumab, lead to vessel normalization in addition to their
antivascular effect. Major characteristics of vessel normalization include reduced number and size of immature vessels,
increased vessel pericyte coverage, and reduced interstitial
ﬂuid pressure (3, 4). Normal (or normalized) blood vessels are
lined with pericytes. This lining is absent in the abnormal,
immature vessels created during tumor angiogenesis, which
can cause increased leakiness (5).

In the process of vessel normalization, the architecture of
the remaining vasculature is largely restored, leading to
reduced vessel permeability and thereby improving tumor
blood ﬂow and tumor oxygenation (3–8). Bevacizumab is
mainly given in combination with chemotherapy. One possible
explanation for the beneﬁcial effect of this combination therapy is subscribed to vessel normalization leading to increased
tumor uptake of chemotherapy (3, 7, 9–12). However, in a
recent clinical trial, a single dose of 15 mg/kg bevacizumab
reduced the tumor uptake of a radiolabeled docetaxel tracer
dose from as early as 5 hours until 4 days after injection in
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (13). This ﬁnding does
not necessarily indicate loss of efﬁcacy of the combination, as
had been shown in 2 bevacizumab and docetaxel containing
neoadjuvant breast cancer trials (14,15).
The effects of vessel normalization may be even more
important for the intratumoral delivery of macromolecular
drugs such as antibodies (16, 17). These effects might have
implications for combination therapies, when bevacizumab is
combined with other monoclonal antibodies. Although there is
no clear evidence yet for this phenomenon at the tumor level, 2
large clinical colon cancer trials have shown that combining
bevacizumab with cetuximab or panitumumab was less effective than either antibody alone (18, 19). Also, 2 randomized
studies in patients with human EGF receptor 2 (HER2)-positive
metastatic breast cancer showed disappointing impact of
adding bevacizumab to trastuzumab (20, 21). It is therefore
of interest to clarify whether bevacizumab impairs tumor
uptake of other antibodies.

Arjaans et al.

We have developed zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled bevacizumab and 89Zr-trastuzumab as tracers for positron emission
tomographic (PET) scanning to visualize and quantify bevacizumab and trastuzumab biodistribution for both preclinical
and clinical purposes (22–24). These tracers can provide
insight in how bevacizumab affects uptake of other antibodies.
We evaluated the effect of bevacizumab treatment on the
tumor uptake of 89Zr-trastuzumab, 89Zr-bevacizumab, and
89
Zr-immunoglobulin G (IgG). In addition, we tracked the
localization of IgG in the tumors with ex vivo ﬂuorescent
labeling and related the ﬁndings to effects of bevacizumab
treatment on tumor vessel density and vessel normalization.

Materials and Methods
Antibody labeling
Trastuzumab (Roche), bevacizumab (Roche), and human IgG
(Sanquin) were conjugated and labeled with 89Zr as described
previously (22, 24). IgG served as control because it is biochemically comparable to trastuzumab and bevacizumab but has no
afﬁnity for a speciﬁc antigen. In short, puriﬁed trastuzumab,
bevacizumab and IgG were conjugated with the chelator tetraﬂuorphenol-N-succinyldesferal (TFP-N-sucDf; kindly provided
by Dr. G.A. van Dongen, VUMC). Radiolabeling of all conjugates
(N-sucDf-trastuzumab, -bevacizumab, and -IgG) was conducted with clinical grade 89Zr-oxalate (IBA). All 89Zr-tracers
had a purity of >95% before administration to the animals.
IgG was also labeled with IRDye 800CW (LI-COR Biosciences) as described previously (25). Puriﬁed IgG was labeled
with IRDye 800CW and the solution was puriﬁed with a PD-10
desalting column (GE Healthcare). Labeling efﬁciency and
purity of IgG-800CW as determined by SE-HPLC were, respectively, 85% to 90% and >95%.
Animals and tumor inoculation
The human ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cell line was selected
for xenograft experiments because of its high expression of
VEGF and HER2 (24, 26). In addition, the HER2-overexpressing
esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE19 (27) was used for
xenograft experiments. Both tumor models had comparable
tumor growth kinetics in vivo, which allowed the evaluation
of both before- and during-treatment scans at a comparable
tumor size. SKOV-3 was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and OE19 from Sigma-Aldrich. Both cell
lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling
(Baseclear). ATCC HTB-77 was used as the reference proﬁle
for SKOV-3. The evaluation value (EV) obtained for SKOV-3
was 1 and for OE19 was 1.06. SKOV-3 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) and OE19
cells in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (Invitrogen),
both with 4.5 g/mL glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing
5% CO2. For tumor inoculation, the cells were harvested by
trypsinization and resuspended in culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. In vivo imaging and ex vivo
biodistribution experiments were conducted in male nude
mice (HSD; athymic nude-nu, average weight 30 g) obtained
from Harlan. To avoid a pharmacologic effect of the 89Zr-

3348

bevacizumab tracer, in the 89Zr-bevacizumab group, a lower
bevacizumab tracer dosage was essential to evaluate pre- and
posttreatment tumor uptake. To enable imaging of low tracer
dosages, male nude mice (BALB/cOlaHDS-foxnnu, average
weight 20 g) from Harlan were used in the 89Zr-bevacizumab
group because of slower clearance of human IgG in these
animals (28). At 6 to 8 weeks of age, mice were subcutaneously
injected with 1  106 SKOV-3 cells or 3  105 OE19 cells in
0.3 mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and culture medium (1:1).
Tumor growth was assessed by caliper measurements. When
tumors measured 6 to 8 mm in diameter, about 2 to 3 weeks
after inoculation, in vivo studies were started. All animal
experiments were carried out with isoﬂurane inhalation anesthesia (induction 3%, maintenance 1.5%). The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Groningen (Groningen,
the Netherlands).
PET scan imaging and bevacizumab treatment
Clear tumor uptake of 89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-bevacizumab is known to occur 24 hours after tracer injection with an
optimal time point 144 hours after tracer injection (22, 24).
Therefore, PET imaging was conducted 24 or 144 hours after
tracer injection. In the SKOV-3 model, on day 0 of the study
schedule, animals received the ﬁrst tracer gift of 89Zr-trastuzumab (100 mg, 5 MBq), 89Zr-bevacizumab (10 mg, 5 MBq),
or 89Zr-IgG (100 mg, 5 MBq). In the OE19 model, animals
received 89Zr-trastuzumab (100 mg, 5 MBq) on day 0 of the
study schedule. The tracers were injected intravenously in the
penile vein. PET imaging was conducted on days 1 and 6
(respectively, 24 and 144 hours after ﬁrst tracer injection).
From day 7 until 12, we allowed the tracer to decay and the
antibody to remove form the tumor. On days 13, 16, and 19, the
animals received a 5 mg/kg nonlabeled treatment dose bevacizumab according to earlier studies or 0.9% NaCl as placebo
(29). The second tracer injection was administered on day 14,
and PET imaging was conducted on days 15 and 20 (respectively, 24 and 144 hours post second radioactive tracer injection). Animals were sacriﬁced after the last scan on day 20. For
the second tracer injection, both IgG groups received a coinjection of 89Zr-(5 MBq) and IRDye 800CW–labeled IgG to
study the intratumor distribution of IgG with ﬂuorescence
microscopy. The total protein dose was the same as in the ﬁrst
tracer injection, with half of the dose labeled ﬂuorescently. In
total 5 groups were scanned with different tracers and interventions: (i) 89Zr-trastuzumab (n ¼ 7), (ii) 89Zr-bevacizumab
(n ¼ 6), (iii) 89Zr-IgG (n ¼ 6) all treated with bevacizumab, (iv)
89
Zr-IgG (n ¼ 6) treated with placebo all in the SKOV-3 model,
and (v) 89Zr-trastuzumab (n ¼ 6) in the OE19 model treated
with bevacizumab. During each scan sequence, static images of
15 minutes (24 hours postinjection) and 45 minutes (144 hours
postinjection) acquisition time were obtained with a microPET
Focus 220 rodent scanner (CTI Siemens) followed by an 8minute transmission scan. In vivo quantiﬁcation was conducted after image reconstruction with AMIDE Medical Image
Data Examiner software (version 0.9.1). The data are presented
as the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and percentage injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g).

Ex vivo biodistribution and tumor tissue analysis
After the last PET scan on day 20, animals were sacriﬁced
and organs were excised and weighted for biodistribution.
Organs and primed standards were then counted for radioactivity in a calibrated well–type LKB-1282-Compu-gamma
system (LKB Wallac) and corrected for physical decay. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to assess tumor
viability for SKOV-3 and OE19. For immunohistochemical and

1.0  0.2 (27%  21%, P ¼ 0.04) for, respectively, 89Zrtrastuzumab, 89Zr-bevacizumab, and 89Zr-IgG (Fig. 1A). This
effect was even more pronounced at 144 hours (day 6 vs. 20),
with a reduction in 89Zr-trastuzumab tumor uptake from a
SUVmean of 5.2  1.2 before to 3.0  1.0 after bevacizumab
treatment (41%  5%, P < 0.0001) and a similar reduction in
89
Zr-bevacizumab tumor uptake with an SUVmean of 2.8  0.3
to 1.6  0.2 after bevacizumab treatment (43%  4%, P <
0.0001; Fig. 1B).
Tumor uptake of 89Zr-IgG was also lowered, although to a
lesser extent. SUVmean decreased from 1.7  0.2 before to 1.2 
0.1 after bevacizumab treatment (28%  6%, P ¼ 0.0004).
Placebo treatment did not affect 89Zr-IgG uptake in the tumor
with SUVmean tumor uptake of 1.6  0.3 before and 1.6  0.1
after placebo at 24 hours and 1.8  0.4 before and 1.8  0.2 after
placebo at 144-hour PET images (Fig. 1).
In the OE19 model, bevacizumab treatment also decreased
the tumor uptake of 89Zr-trastuzumab. Already on the 24-hour
PET images (day 1 vs. 15), the SUVmean tumor uptake values
decreased from 2.7  0.7 to 1.8  0.7 (34%  15%, P ¼ 0.004).
At 144 hours (day 6 vs. 20), the SUVmean tumor uptake
decreased even more from 3.9  1.2 to 2.5  1.4 (39% 
16%, P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 2).
Ex vivo biodistribution of the tracer in nontumor tissues
and the tumor, for all 4 groups in the SKOV-3 model, are shown
in Fig. 3A. Ex vivo biodistribution for both 89Zr-trastuzumab
and 89Zr-bevacizumab were comparable with earlier described
data, with high uptake of the tracer in the tumor, moderate
uptake in the blood pool and highly vascularized organs, and
low uptake in the remaining organs. (22, 30). The ex vivo
biodistribution data of 89Zr-trastuzumab in the OE19 model
were similar to the pattern in the SKOV-3 model (Supplementary Fig. S1A) For 89Zr-IgG, tumor uptake was lower when the
animals had received bevacizumab than the placebo-treated
89
Zr-IgG group for both the ex vivo biodistribution tumor
uptake (P ¼ 0.02) and the in vivo PET tumor uptake (P ¼
0.0001; Fig. 3B). Tumor uptake of the in vivo PET data nicely

(Hamamatsu). Tissue viability was expressed as the total
percentage of necrosis in the tumor within ﬁxed size squares
overlaying the tumor sections. Analysis was conducted
using NanoZoomer Digital Pathology viewer software (Hamamatsu). To visualize endothelial cells, a ﬂuorescent double
staining with an antibody against Meca32 (1:40, BD Biosciences) was conducted, whereas to visualize pericytes an
antibody, a-smooth muscle actin was used (SMA; 1:100, Sigma). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33528 (1:5,000, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Tumor sections were analyzed using
a Leica DM6000 microscope, and images shown were captured with a Leica DFC360FX camera and processed with
LAS-AF2 software (Leica). In 3 predeﬁned angiogenic hot spot
areas, the degree of pericyte coverage was examined at a 200
magniﬁcation and scored for no, partial, or full coverage.
Fluorescence microscopy analysis of IgG-800CW together
with Hoechst staining was determined in tumor sections as
described before (25), and overview images were obtained with
the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Image analysis was conducted using FV10-ASW (version 1.6).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD. PET data were analyzed
with the paired Student t test. Ex vivo analysis was executed
with the unpaired t test. All statistical analyses were conducted
with Prism 5 (GraphPad). P  0.05 (2-tailed) was considered
signiﬁcant.

was absent in only 10%  14% of the tumor vessels (P < 0.0001),
whereas 75%  21% of the vessels were fully covered (P <

present in the extracellular matrix, and bevacizumab treatment reduced the accumulation of IgG-800CW relative to the
placebo (Fig. 4B). This matches the PET results. Bevacizumab
treatment did not affect tumor morphology and viability in
both the SKOV-3 and OE19 model. In addition, bevacizumab
did not affect the proliferation index in the SKOV-3 model.

Discussion
This study shows that bevacizumab treatment substantially reduces the tumor uptake of the antibodies trastuzumab, bevacizumab, and IgG. In addition, we show an induction of vessel normalization and decrease in MVD in these
tumors by bevacizumab treatment. As bevacizumab also
lowered the uptake of IgG in the tumor, the results for the
antibodies cannot solely be explained by a therapeutic effect
or tumor saturation by bevacizumab itself. Therefore, these
results show that bevacizumab treatment can impair penetration of large molecules such as antibodies into the

Bevacizumab treatment induces a shift from tumor vessels with hardly any pericyte coverage to vessels mainly fully covered with pericytes.

tumor, resulting in a reduced tumor uptake of these
antibodies.
In several preclinical settings such as murine mammary
carcinoma, human small cell lung carcinoma, human glioblastoma multiforme, and human colon adenocarcinoma, blocking
VEGF signaling not only led to a depletion of the vasculature
but also created a morphologically and functionally normalized vascular network of the remaining vessels (3, 4, 8, 31, 32).
There are also additional preclinical data supporting the effect
of vessel normalization on drug uptake by tumors. In an
orthotopic mammary model, the effect of vessel normalization by antiangiogenic treatment was shown for uptake of
nanomedicines ranging from 12 to 125 nm in size. The mice
received 5 mg/kg of the mouse anti-VEGF antibody DC101
every 3 days. Intravital imaging showed that DC101 treatment led to vessel normalization in the tumor and thereby
inﬂuenced the penetration of nanomedicines in the tumor.
Small 12-nm particles took advantage of the induced vessel
normalization, leading to better penetration of these particles into the tumor. Conversely, tumor uptake of 125-nm
particles was reduced (33). We observed a reduction in tumor
antibody uptake within 24 hours of tracer injection. This
reduction was even more pronounced after 6 days, which
coincided with a normalized tumor vasculature illustrated by
increased pericyte coverage of the remaining vessels in the
tumor.
Another recent study described the effect of a single administration of the species cross-reactive anti-VEGF-A antibody
B20-4.1 24 hours before tracer injection on the biodistribution
and pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab (34). Tumor-bearing
mice received trastuzumab labeled with the SPECT tracers

indium-111 (111In) or iodine-125 (125I) and were treated with or
without B20-4.1. Biodistribution data showed a 25% to 30%
decrease for both 111In- and 125I-trastuzumab tumor uptake for
up to 7 days. SPECT-CT images made 2 days after anti-VEGF
therapy also showed a decrease of 111In-trastuzumab uptake
in the tumor. The advantage of PET scanning, which we used
over SPECT scanning, is that it is easier to quantify uptake.
We observed a 41% decrease in vivo of the PET tracer89Zrtrastuzumab tumor uptake after bevacizumab treatment. This
decrease already occurred within 1 day after tracer injection
and the start of bevacizumab treatment. Moreover, we
observed a decrease in uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab and
89
Zr-IgG after bevacizumab treatment.
We observed no effect on tumor size of bevacizumab
treatment and 89Zr-trastuzumab compared with placebo and
89
Zr-IgG in the SKOV-3 model. This might be due to the fact
that we treated the animals over a relatively short period of
time (1 week) with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) and one single gift
of trastuzumab (100 mg, corresponding with a dose of 4 mg/kg).
However, there are only very limited preclinical data on the
biologic effect of combining bevacizumab with trastuzumab
(35, 36) This will likely be due to the fact that testing antitumor
efﬁcacy of humanized antibodies in an animal model has its
limitation, as trastuzumab has inherent immunomodulatory
activity (37–40). More importantly ﬁndings in the clinic show
that bevacizumab treatment does not contribute favorably to
the effect of trastuzumab and support the idea that vessel
normalization by bevacizumab has the same effects in patients.
In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the
combination of bevacizumab and trastuzumab showed only a
minimal-to-no improvement in progression-free survival

(20, 21). Combination studies of bevacizumab plus another
antibody have shown a detrimental or only modestly beneﬁcial
effect. In colorectal cancer, bevacizumab and the EGF receptor
1 (EGFR1) antibody cetuximab are both active drugs when
combined with chemotherapy. In addition, cetuximab has
some activity as monotherapy (41, 42). But the combination
of chemotherapy, bevacizumab and cetuximab even negatively
affected the progression-free survival of patients with colorectal cancer compared with chemotherapy and bevacizumab
alone in the CAIRO2 trial (18). A possible explanation of this
reduced therapeutic efﬁcacy was considered to be the fact
that tumor-promoting M2 macrophages are activated by
cetuximab in the local tumor microenvironment. This would
lead to increased local VEGF production (43), resulting in
insufﬁcient depletion by bevacizumab. In addition, on the
basis of the present study, one could argue that the cetuximab
levels in the tumors of these patients were likely lower
because of the simultaneous treatment with bevacizumab.
Analogously, in the PACCE trial, the addition of the EGFR1
antibody panitumumab to bevacizumab and chemotherapy
in patients with colorectal cancer also led to a decrease in
progression-free survival (19). That vessel normalization
by bevacizumab affects antibody uptake in the clinic is
supported by a preliminary report in which we showed a
47% lower tumor uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab after bevacizumab treatment in 11 patients with renal cell cancer (44).
Overall these clinical data are in line with a considerable
biologic effect of reduced antibody uptake after bevacizumab
treatment.
PET scanning with 89Zr-labeled antibodies can be used in
future clinical studies as a supportive tool for more rationally
designed treatment regimens containing bevacizumab
combined with other antibodies. This can give additional
insight whether choosing a treatment schedule affects tumor

antibody distribution in patients and in this way PET imaging
may contribute to improved and rational use of bevacizumab.
