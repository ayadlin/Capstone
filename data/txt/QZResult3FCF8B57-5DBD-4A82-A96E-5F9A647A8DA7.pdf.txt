Abstract

Author Manuscript

Current standard of care for muscle-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) is surgery along with
perioperative platinum-based chemotherapy. UCC is sensitive to cisplatin-based regimens, but
acquired resistance eventually occurs, and a subset of tumors is intrinsically resistant. Thus, there
is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches to target chemotherapy-resistant UCC. Yesassociated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator that has been associated with bladder
cancer progression and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. In contrast, YAP has been shown to
induce DNA damage associated apoptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, no data
have been reported on the YAP role in UCC chemo-resistance. Thus, we have investigated the
potential dichotomous role of YAP in UCC response to chemotherapy utilizing two patient-derived
xenograft models recently established. Constitutive expression and activation of YAP inversely
correlated with in vitro and in vivo cisplatin sensitivity. YAP overexpression protected while YAP
knock-down sensitized UCC cells to chemotherapy and radiation effects via increased
accumulation of DNA damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological YAP inhibition with

verteporfin inhibited tumor cell proliferation and restored sensitivity to cisplatin. In addition,
nuclear YAP expression was associated with poor outcome in UCC patients who received
perioperative chemotherapy. In conclusion, these results suggest that YAP activation exerts a
protective role and represents a pharmacological target to enhance the anti-tumor effects of DNA
damaging modalities in the treatment of UCC.

Introduction
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common malignancy in men and the
tenth in women, with approximately 72,570 new cases and 15,210 deaths estimated in 2013
in the United States (1). At the initial diagnosis, approximately 30% of tumors have already
infiltrated the bladder muscle wall and are classified as muscle-invasive bladder cancers
(MIBCs). MIBC is associated with poor prognosis since it can rapidly progress and
metastasize. The overall 5 year survival ranges from 48% to 66% (2, 3). Standard of care for
MIBC is cystectomy combined with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, such as
gemcitabine and cisplatin (4) and methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin
(MVAC) (5). Unfortunately, the clinical benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is limited
and the majority of the patients eventually develop cisplatin resistant disease (6). The lack of
improvement in MIBC-associated mortality in the last three decades represents a major
challenge; and identifying new therapeutic approaches for this resistant disease is an urgent
and unmet need. Different mechanisms responsible for cisplatin-resistance have been
proposed, including a reduced intracellular drug accumulation, an increased drug
sequestration, an activated DNA damage repair machinery or an impairment in the apoptotic
signal transduction pathways (7).

Author Manuscript

Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional co-activator, is a key component of the
Hippo tumor suppressor pathway (8). Hippo pathway-mediated YAP phosphorylation on
Ser127 mainly leads to its interaction with 14-3-3 and cytoplasm sequestration or
ubiquitination and degradation (9). Conversely, un-phosphorylated YAP translocates into the
nucleus where it binds to the TEAD transcription factor (10), triggering the expression of
several genes involved in organ size control, cell proliferation, and survival. YAP was
originally identified as an oncogene in a variety of tumors, where it was shown to promote
growth factor independent proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and suppression
of tumor necrosis factor and FAS-induced apoptosis (11-16). YAP has also been found to
confer resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer (17, 18). Furthermore, the yap gene is located
in an amplicon (11q22), historically detected in numerous malignancies, including bladder
cancer (19). More recently, a study from Liu and colleagues correlated YAP over-expression
with poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients (20). Contrarily, YAP has also been shown to
interact with and enhance p73-dependant apoptosis in response to DNA damage in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (21, 22); and to have a tumor-suppressor role in breast (23) and

head and neck cancers (24). Furthermore, miRNA141-driven YAP down-regulation has been
reported to be a cisplatin-resistance mechanism in esophageal carcinoma (25).
To examine the potential dichotomous role of YAP in DNA-damage induced apoptosis, we
generated in vitro and in vivo UCC models of cisplatin resistance. In this study we report
that genetic and pharmacological YAP inhibition sensitizes UCC cells to DNA damageinduced apoptosis.

Constitutive YAP expression inversely correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in UCC patientderived xenograft models

To test the hypothesis whether YAP confers resistance to cisplatin in UCC, we
subcutaneously implanted UCC patient tumor tissues into immunodeficient SCID mice and
established patient-derived xenografts from two high grade muscle-invasive urothelial
carcinoma cases (RP-B-01 and RP-B-02). RP-B-01 was established from a T4, high grade
urothelial carcinoma invading through the bladder wall into the sigmoid colon with venous/
lymphoid invasion. RP-B-02 was established from a T2, high grade urothelial carcinoma
infiltrating into the bladder muscolaris propria. Both carcinomas are p53 wild type and
display a basal phenotype (cytokeratin 5 and 6 positive, cytokeratin 20 negative; data not
shown) and squamous differentiation (Fig. 1A and 1D). Cisplatin (CDDP) intraperitoneal
injections (1x/week, 5 or 10 mg/kg) had a minimal effect on RP-B-01 end-of-treatment
tumor weights (Fig. 1B, ANOVA p= 0.139,vehicle vs. CDDP 5 and 10 mg/kg treated; p=
0.447 and p= 0.087, respectively),whereas significantly inhibited RP-B-02 tumor growth
(Fig. 1E, ANOVA p= 0.031, vehicle vs. CDDP 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treated; p= 0.022 and
p= 0.0066, respectively). YAP immunohistochemical staining revealed a strong nuclear
staining in RP-B-01, but weak, mostly cytosolic staining in RP-B-02 primary tumors;
noteworthy, the PDXs conserved this differential YAP expression (Fig. 1C and 1F). Western
blot analysis confirmed the differential YAP expression in the two PDXs (Fig. 1G).
Furthermore, the majority of YAP was phosphorylated in RP-B-02, suggesting a defective
nuclear localization and activation of this transcriptional co-activator, while no
phosphorylated protein was detectable in RP-B-01 tumors.
Increased YAP expression in a PDX model of acquired resistance to cisplatin

Author Manuscript

To better understand the mechanisms of in vivo cisplatin resistance, we established a PDX
model that mimics acquired cisplatin-resistant disease (Fig. 1H and 1I). To our knowledge,
this is the first reported UCC PDX model where cisplatin-resistance was achieved by in vivo
chronic, dose-intense drug administration. Western blot analysis of tumor lysates from both
parental and cisplatin resistant RP-B-02 models showed no detectable difference in total
YAP protein expression, but a substantial decrease in Ser127 phosphorylation in the resistant
phenotype, highlighting a reduction of the YAP inactive form. Accordingly, the cisplatinresistant RP-B-02 C-r variant revealed a significant increase in Cyr61, connective tissue
growth factor (CTGF), and survivin expression, YAP-TEADs downstream target genes (Fig.
1J) (10). An increased YAP activation in the resistant model was also suggested by IHC

staining, that showed a strong increase in nuclear YAP localization, as compared to the
parental model (Fig. 1K).
In vivo cisplatin resistance is maintained in vitro in the PDX-derived UCC cells
To evaluate the role of YAP in vitro, we isolated and established stable proliferating cancer
cells from all three UCC PDX models (Fig. 2A). Figure 2B shows a representative Western
blot comparing PDX-derived cells response to cisplatin by analyzing cleavage of caspase 3
and its immediate target PARP. PI exclusion assay (cell survival, Fig. 2B) and apoptosis
detection (Fig. 2C) after cisplatin treatment confirmed the in vivo observations; RP-B-02
cells were strongly sensitive to even low concentrations of cisplatin while the derivedresistant model was less sensitive than the parental RP-B-02. RP-B-01 cells showed
approximately 50% survival, even at high concentrations.

YAP molecular modulation regulates UCC cells response to cisplatin and supports its
oncogenic role

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To test the hypothesis whether YAP plays a critical role in cisplatin response in UCC, we
modulated its expression in different UCC models and examined the response to cisplatin
treatment. RP-B-01, RP-B-02 C-r, and T24 human UCC cells (models with constitutively
high YAP expression) were infected with either YAP shRNAs (labeled as YAPsh) or a nonsilencing control shRNA (labeled as NSsh) expressing pGIPZ lentiviral vector. Protein
knock-down in puromycin selected, stably shRNAs-expressing cells was validated by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, YAP shRNA infection in the RP-B-01 cells
led to >30% cell death, seven days after infection, without any selection process. GFP signal
2 days-post infection revealed comparable infection rates between control non-silencing
shRNA and YAP shRNA vectors, confirming that at least a subpopulation of RP-B-01
cancer cells relies on YAP as a main proliferation driver (Suppl. Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the
stable selected YAP knocked-down RP-B-01 sub-clone proliferated slower than the control
cells, suggesting a YAP oncogenic addiction in this model (Fig. 3B) (26). Importantly, YAP
silencing resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin-induced cell death (48 hours after 3
μg/ml) as shown by propidium iodide exclusion assay and flow cytometry in RP-B-01, p=
0.0027 (Fig. 3C) and T24 cells, p= 0.013 (Fig. 3D). To determine which mechanism of cell
death was involved, we analyzed some apoptosis markers at 48 hours post-cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 3E). All YAP-silenced cells displayed greater induction of caspase 3 and
PARP cleavage with increasing concentrations of cisplatin, suggesting that YAP has a
protective role against cisplatin-induced apoptosis in UCC cells. Cell growth upon cisplatin
treatment was also impaired by YAP knock-down in T24 cells (Suppl. Fig. 1B). Next, we
overexpressed either the constitutively active (mutated in Ser127, labeled as S127A) isoform
of YAP in RP-B-02 and 253J cells (models with low endogenous YAP expression) using a
lentiviral pWPI vector (Fig. 3F and Suppl. Fig 1C). The overexpression of the constitutively
active form of YAP induced increased protection from cisplatin-induced cell death compared
to pWPI empty control vector (labeled as e.v.) infected cells (Fig. 3G and Suppl. Fig.1D).
YAP-mediated chemo-protection was confirmed in both cell lines also by Western blot
analysis for apoptosis markers (Fig. 3H and Suppl. Fig.1E). Furthermore, also the
overexpression of the wild type form of YAP defended cancer cells from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Suppl. Fig. 1D and 1E).

YAP knock-down sensitizes T24 cells to DNA-damaging agents and induces apoptosis via

we analyzed cisplatin-induced DNA damage in YAP knocked-down T24 cells by the comet
assay. YAP knock-down cells displayed more than double DNA damage than control cells
by tail length measurements either 24 or 48 hours post 3 μg/ml cisplatin treatment (Fig.
4A,). The main reported mechanism of response to DNA double-strand breaks is through the
activation of the apical kinase ATM that through its downstream signaling pathway leads to
either cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis (27, 28). To determine the kinetics of
DNA damage (response) induction after cisplatin treatment, we assessed a time-course
activation of ATM and H2A.X. One hour after cisplatin treatment we detected a p-ATM
signal in both settings, which quickly vanished in the non-silencing control, while the DNA
damage (response) in T24 YAP knock-down cells was sustained in time. These data suggest
that DNA is not efficiently repaired in the YAP knock-down cells (Fig. 4B and 4C).
Furthermore, following fixation 24 hours after treatment, in T24 YAP knock-down cells,
cisplatin induced a significant activation of ATM immediate downstream target, H2A.X,
starting at very low concentrations (1.5 μg/ml), while in non-silencing control infected T24
cells, this concentration of cisplatin was not able to induce neither ATM nor H2A.X
activation. To test whether this protective role of YAP was associated only to cisplatin or to
DNA damage in general, we used γ irradiation and two other DNA-damaging agents, the
anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin and the podophyllum peltatum toxin etoposide. ATM
and H2A.X phosphorylation detection showed that all three genotoxic modalities (Fig. 4C)
induced greater DNA damage (response) in T24 YAP knock-down clone than in the nonsilencing control cells. As shown with cisplatin treatment, increased DNA damage in the
YAP knock-down led to an increase in apoptosis, suggesting that the protective role of YAP
towards DNA-damage and apoptosis is not exclusive to cisplatin treatment (Fig. 4D). Next,
we investigated whether YAP-TEAD downstream target genes were involved in DNA
damage and pro-survival mechanisms. Along with confirming Cyr61 and CTGF downregulation in the YAP knocked-down cells, we also probed our models for survivin, a
candidate YAP target involved in cell survival (Fig. 4E). We were able to detect survivin
down-regulation in all YAP knocked-down models.
YAP silencing sensitizes T24 cells to in vivo cisplatin anti-tumor activity

Author Manuscript

To test the contribution of YAP to cisplatin resistance in vivo, SCID mice (6-7/group) were
injected subcutaneously with T24 or T24 YAP knocked-down cells. Immunohistochemical
staining confirmed YAP protein down-regulation in T24 YAPsh (Fig. 5B). Following a four
week treatment schedule (6mg/kg, 1x/week), YAP knock-down sensitized T24 to cisplatin
anti-tumor activity. End-of-treatment tumor weights: ANOVA p= 0.015, vehicle vs. cisplatin
treated in T24: p= 0.651; in T24 YAPsh p= 0.042, cisplatin-treated parental T24 vs.
cisplatin-treated T24 YAPsh: p= 0.015 (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, Ki67 immunohistochemical
staining revealed that cisplatin inhibited cancer cell proliferation following YAP knockdown, while parental cells were not significantly affected (ANOVA p= 0.0031, Fig. 5B and
5C). To assess DNA damage, we stained tumor tissues to detect phosphorylated ATM and
H2A.X (Fig. 5B). As expected, cisplatin treatment induced a significant increase of DNA
damage in both models. Interestingly, YAP silenced tumors displayed significantly higher

basal levels of these markers, while cisplatin exacerbated even more the difference in DNA
damage compared to parental T24 tumors (ANOVA p< 0.0001 for both pATM and pH2A.X)
(Fig. 5D and 5E).
The YAP inhibitor verteporfin has anti-tumor activity in UCC cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A recent study reported that verteporfin (VP), a benzoporphyrin derivative, can disrupt the
YAP-TEAD interaction, therefore inhibiting the role of YAP in the control of liver size (29).
VP is a FDA-approved drug for photodynamic therapy to treat macular degeneration of the
retina (30). T24 and RP-B-01 cells showed a dose-dependent decreased expression of YAPTEAD down-stream genes such as CTGF and survivin, 12 hours to 24 hours following VP
treatment (Suppl. Fig. 2A). Figure 6A shows 18 hours post-VP treatment protein expression.
In RP-B-01 tumor cells, survivin and CTGF protein expression was down-regulated by
~40% and 65%following treatment with 250 nM VP and 2 μM VP, respectively. Similar data
was obtained in VP-treated T24 cells. Thus, we tested whether VP can exert anti-tumor
activity in UCC cell lines as either single agent or as a chemo-sensitizer. In RP-B-01 cells, as
predicted by the RNA interference experiment, VP treatment induced apoptotic cell death at
nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 6B and 6E). T24 cell death was observed at higher VP
concentrations (Fig. 6B and 6E). Interestingly, T24 cells showed ATM activation at VP
concentrations lower than in RP-B-01, not necessarily leading to massive induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 6A). Next, we assessed cell death and apoptosis following combination
treatment with cisplatin and VP, as a potential chemo-sensitizer. Low concentrations of
cisplatin and VP concomitant treatment modestly increased CDDP-induced cell death in RPB-01 and such increase was only slightly detectable in T24 cells (labeled as +c) (Fig. 6F).
Conversely, when we performed 18 hours pre-treatment with 500nM VP, followed by
CDDP, we found a dramatic increase of cell death in both RP-B-01 (p= 0.0006 with 1.5
μg/ml CDDP and p= 0.0002 with 3 μg/ml CDDP) (Fig. 6C); and T24 cells (p= 0.049 with
1.5 μg/ml CDDP and p= 0.039 with 3 μg/ml CDDP) (Fig. 6D). With this sequential setting,
we also found a more rapid and earlier induction of apoptosis: 12 hours post CDDP
treatment, caspase 3 and PARP cleavages were detectable only in the cells pre-treated with
VP (labeled as +s) (Fig. 6F), while cells treated with CDDP alone were not yet displaying an
induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, since it has been demonstrated that survivin upregulation can inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis in different cancers (31, 32), we assessed
the expression of survivin in T24 cells following CDDP and VP treatment. As already
shown, VP down-regulates survivin, while a sub-lethal concentration of cisplatin induced a
substantial increase in protein expression, presumably as a cancer cell survival mechanism
(Fig. 6G). Interestingly, VP treatment could revert CDDP-induced survivin up-regulation to
basal levels, suggesting a link between survivin and YAP in drug resistance.

High nuclear YAP expression correlates with poor outcome in UCC patients who have
received chemotherapy
YAP immunohistochemical staining was performed in 171 UCC patient samples, including
42 tissues from patients who received primarily platinum-based regimens (see details in
Suppl. Fig. 3A). We scored YAP staining in both the nuclear and cytosolic compartments,
classifying them as 0 for negative staining, 1+, 2+, and 3+ for differential increasing
positivity (Fig. 7A and Suppl. Fig. 4A). YAP staining revealed that ~40% of samples in our

collection had strong nuclear intensity (3+) (Fig. 7B). Thus, we dichotomized patients as
high (3+) or low (0, 1+ and 2+) nuclear YAP staining and analyzed overall survival (OS,
defined as the time from diagnosis until death or last follow-up) and recurrence free survival
(RFS, defined as the time from diagnosis until recurrence, death or last follow-up in patients
that were once disease free). Thus, we detected a significant association between
dichotomized nuclear YAP expression and both OS (p<0.001) (Fig. 7C) and RFS (p<0.001)
(Fig. 7D). The propensity adjusted analysis support nuclear YAP expression as an
independent predictor of OS (p<0.001; HR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.43-3.15) and RFS (p=0.001;
HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.34-3.30). The hazard ratios indicate that patients with high nuclear
YAP expression tend to have poorer outcomes. Then, to further investigate the role of YAP
in chemo-resistance, we performed the same analysis within the cohort of patients who had
received perioperative chemotherapy. We found a significant association between
dichotomized nuclear YAP expression and both OS (p=0.003) (Fig. 7E) and RFS (p=0.021)
(Fig. 7F). The multivariate analysis confirmed that, when adjusting for other significant
factors (age, grade, and treatment status), YAP is independently associated with OS and
RFS. In contrast, cytosolic YAP failed to be a predictive marker for patient outcome and
response to chemotherapy (Suppl. Fig. 4E).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Standard of care for muscle-invasive UCC is surgery with perioperative platinum-based
chemotherapy regimens. However, recurrent disease remains a major hurdle, with a median
overall survival that has not changed over the past three decades. Thus, there is an urgent
need for validated prognostic molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for chemotherapy
and/or novel therapies in cisplatin resistant disease to improve thepoor outcome currently
associated with muscle-invasive UCC (6). To date, reliable predictive markers of response
are not available despite several studies on putative candidates including Bcl-2 (33) and p53
(34, 35). Our results suggest that YAP is a novel potential predictor of response to cisplatin
and a target for therapeutic intervention in patients with UCC.

Research over the past decade has demonstrated the critical role of the Hippo tumor
suppressor pathway in organ development and cancer. Indeed, there is growing interest in
this survival pathway as a novel target for a pharmacological approach in cancer treatment.
According to provisional studies from TCGA available on the cBio Cancer Genomics
Portal(36),UCC is ranked as the second cancer for alteration frequency of a cohort of Hippo
pathway genes including YAP (12 %) (Suppl. Fig. 5A and 5B). A central role in the Hippo
pathway is played by two downstream targets YAP and TAZ (8, 14, 15, 37). Recent studies
have reported the involvement of YAP in resistance to multiple drugs, such as cisplatin (17,
18), erlotinib and surivivin inhibitors (38), anti-tubulin drugs (39), and radiation therapy
(16). YAP has failed as a prognostic marker in breast cancer (40), while it has been proposed
in ovarian cancer (17, 18), urothelial (20) and hepatocellular carcinoma (41), but it has never
been specifically linked to chemotherapy treatment benefit. Our study suggests for the first
time that high nuclear YAP may predict poor response to chemotherapy in UCC patients.
Furthermore, we demonstrated through genetic and pharmacological targeting that YAP has
an oncogenic role in UCC, driving in vivo and in vitro resistance to DNA-damaging agents
induced apoptosis and, in a PDX model, also proliferation and survival. Indeed, YAP knockOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 18.

down in T24 cells induced basal ATM phosphorylation, suggesting an increased genetic
damage in this setting even without treatment. Under our experimental conditions, both
cisplatin and γ irradiation induced stronger and long lasting ATM activation (2 to 24 hours
and 10 minutes to 10 hours, respectively) following YAP knock-down, supporting our
hypothesis of YAP role in DNA damage sensing and repair in UCC.

Although a set of genes such as CTGF, cyr61, survivin, amphiregulin, and AXL (10, 14, 15,
41) has been identified as YAP-TEADs transcriptional targets, none of them have been
demonstrated to correlate with YAP expression and YAP-driven drug resistance in cancer
patients.However, among these downstream targets, CTGF and survivin are the genes that
have been independently linked to drug resistance. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of
apoptosis protein family widely over-expressed in human cancers and well known for
driving evasion from apoptosis, one of the central mechanisms leading to chemotherapy
resistance. We were able to detect survivin protein up-regulation after sub-lethal cisplatin
treatment in T24 cells and to prevent this induction by pharmacological YAP targeting,
suggesting the possible involvement of YAP in survivin-driven evasion from apoptosis in our
UCC model. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that survivin attenuates apoptotic
response to cisplatin in small cell lung cancer, ovarian and gastric cancer, whereas in UCC it
has only been linked to poor prognosis, without any analysis of outcome in relation to
treatment (31, 32). Moreover, survivin has been shown to directly trigger a double strand
break repair mechanism, leading to radiation resistance (42). This data could in part explain
the increase in basal DNA damage and its accumulation after treatment in our YAP
knockdown UCC cells, where survivin levels were dramatically decreased. CTGF has been
linked to resistance to different classes of drugs in multiple cancers (37, 43); and a recent
study linked CTGF to cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma through survivin up-regulation
(44), reinforcing the hypothesis for a role of YAP-TEADs downstream genes in drug
resistance. The role of Cyr61 is more controversial, since it has been linked to both
induction and prevention of apoptosis (37, 45, 46).To identify the potential mechanisms
responsible for the protective effect of YAP activation, we tested the effects of two additional
cytotoxic drugs, doxorubicin and etoposide, and investigated whether YAP-driven
transcription could regulate drug uptake/efflux imbalance. Interestingly, YAP protection
from DNA damage-induced apoptosis was not exclusive to cisplatin treatment, but it seems a
general defense towards different genotoxic modalities, including radiation. This important
observation suggests that the mechanism(s) responsible for the protective effects of YAP in
UCC cells from cytotoxic agents does not appear to involve drug uptake/efflux.
Furthermore, in the YAP knock-down cells, DNA damage still induced ATM activation and
damage kept accumulating in time, suggesting that the reparative response was impaired
rather than DNA damage sensing. Thus, we can hypothesize that failure of mechanisms
designated to repair DNA damage and down-regulation of apoptotic pathways could be the
reason for the observed resistant phenotype. Future studies aimed to identify the molecular
mechanisms responsible for the regulation of YAP-TEAD signaling could shed additional
light on the modulation of the DNA-damage response and potential additional therapeutic
targets to overcome drug resistance.
The molecular genetic classification of UCC has evolved with the identifications of distinct
subtypes (35, 47). The basal bladder cancers have been reported to be intrinsically

aggressive, but also highly sensitive to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy (35).
Interestingly, our two PDXs presented a basal phenotype, but had different cisplatin
sensitivity and YAP expression. Our TMA analysis showed a high percentage of UCC
patient samples with strong nuclear YAP (~40%), suggesting that YAP alteration may be
relatively common in UCC. The results also suggest that both genetic and pharmacological
targeting of YAP led to significant apoptosis in the patient-derived model RP-B-01,
highlighting a strong oncogenic role for YAP in UCC. Thus, pharmacological targeting of
YAP represents an intriguing opportunity in drug development. Verteporfin has been
reported to be an effective YAP inhibitor that induces apoptosis in different cancers
including prostate cancer (48) and uveal melanoma (49, 50). Our single-agent and
combination studies with verteporfin provide preliminary evidence that this drug
repurposing may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the armamentarium of precision
medicine for UCC patients.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, our results suggest that YAP plays an oncogenic role in UCC and represents a
rational target for therapeutic interventions to enhance the anti-tumor effects of DNA
damage inducing modalities. Prospective studies should confirm the predictive role of YAP
and identify the patients who are most likely to achieve complete pathology response
following either neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy or radiation therapy for organ
preservation.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of UCC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs)

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

UCC patients consented to an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol to collect tumor
samples at the time of cystectomy. Part of the tumor tissue was fixed in neutral-buffered
formalin for immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin/eosin staining. The remaining tissue
was snap-frozen or cut into ~20 mm3pieces for subcutaneous implantation in SCID mice.
All of the procedures in the animal research protocol were approved by Roswell Park Cancer
Institute IACUC (Institute Animal Care and Use Committee). Six-week-old female
immunodeficient SCID mice were purchased from Roswell Park Cancer Institute and
housed in a temperature controlled room on a 12/12 hours light/dark schedule with food and
water ad libitum, under pathogen-free conditions. When tumors reached a size of ~1300
mm3 were excised, cut in pieces, and re-implanted into a new cohort of mice for expansion.
Sample size was determined based on statistical power and ethic guidelines. Criteria for
animal inclusion and exclusion were based on an independent assessment according to
AAA-LAC guidelines, and a posteriori all mice enrolled in the studies have been included in
the final analysis.
Cell isolation and culture
Tumor specimens from the above-mentioned PDXs were collected, minced into small

with a fibroblast feeder cell system was adapted from the protocol described by Liu and
colleagues (51). Briefly, cancer cells were co-cultivated with irradiated Swiss 3T3
fibroblasts (30 Gy) in F medium: 3:1 (v/v) Ham's F-12 Medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's

medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 8.4 ng/ml
cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 24 μg/ml adenine, and 10 μM Y-27632
(Enzo Life Sciences). Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2, 37°C incubator and cancer cells
were separated from fibroblasts through differential trypsinization. After a few passages,
proliferating PDX-derived cell models (RP-B-01, RP-B-02 and RP-B-02 C-r cells) grew in F
medium without fibroblasts and were confirmed by chromosomal analysis to be of human
origin. Human urothelial cell carcinoma cell line T24 was purchased from ATCC. 253J cells
were kindly provided by Dr. Colin Dinney (MD Anderson Cancer Center). UCC cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100
μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2, 37°C incubator. Cells were tested to be mycoplasma-free.
In vivo cisplatin studies and establishment of a cisplatin-resistant PDX model

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Tumor pieces (~15 mm3) from early passage PDXs (passage 2-6) were implanted, or T24
and T24 YAPsh cells (5×106) were injected subcutaneously in six-week-old female
immunodeficient SCID mice. Tumor growth was assessed weekly by caliper measurements,
and the size expressed as mean volume (V=l×w2×0.5)± standard error (SE). When average
tumor dimension reached 150 to 200 mm3, mice were randomized in a blinded fashion into
homogenous groups (4-7 mice/group) and assigned to different treatments. For in vivo
studies, cis-diammineplatinum (II) dichloride (cisplatin)(Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in
0.9% sodium chloride injection solution to a concentration of 0.5 to1 mg/ml, therefore
injecting 10 μl/g resulted in 5 to 10 mg/kg treatment. Intra-peritoneal injections were
performed once weekly, for a total of 2 (10 mg/kg in PDX experiments), 3 (5 mg/kg in PDX
experiments) or 4 injections (T24 experiment). Treatment-related toxicity was determined by
monitoring mouse weight weekly. Collection of tumor samples and tumor weight
determination were performed when mice were sacrificed at the end of the study (day 20 for
PDX experiments, day 27 for T24 experiment). To establish a PDX model of cisplatin
resistance, we implanted RP-B-02 tumors subcutaneously and treated the mice with 2.5
mg/kg cisplatin once a week (Suppl. Fig. 1A). After two months, when some subcutaneous
tumors more than doubled in size, the dose was increased to 5 mg/kg (Fig. 1H). Following
an additional two months, the tumors that continued to grow in 5 mg/kg were re-implanted
in additional mice and the selection process continued at this dose for two more passages. A
third generation of RP-B-02 C-r tumors was assessed to validate resistance.
RNA interference and expression plasmids

Author Manuscript

Expression arrest pGIPZ lentiviral vector encoding non silencing control shRNA or YAP1
shRNAs (V2LHS_65508 and V2LHS_65509, Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems) were
provided by the Roswell Park Cancer Institute shRNA Core Shared Resource. Virus
supernatant was applied with 8 μg/ml polybrene on 60-70% confluent cells and non-infected
cells were eliminated through puromycin selection. Lentiviral pWPI vector with human wild
type YAP or YAP S127A expression construct was prepared as previously described (15).
Briefly, YAP-expressing lentiviruses were prepared in 293T cells; human UCC cell
transduction and FACS sorting were performed following standard protocols.

Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Tumor pieces or cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with protease
inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies
used were as follows: phosphorylated Ser1981 ATM (ab81292), phosphorylated Ser127
YAP (ab76252) (Abcam); CTGF (bs-0743R, Bioss); caspase 3 (#9662), Asp175 cleaved
caspase 3 (#9664), GAPDH (#5174), phosphorylated Ser139 H2A.X (#9718), PARP
(#9542), Asp214 cleaved PARP (#9541) (Cell Signaling); β-actin (sc-47778), survivin
(sc-17779), YAP (sc-15407) (Santa Cruz), Ki67 (RM9106S1, Thermo Scientific), α-tubulin
(04-1117, Millipore). Apoptosis evaluation through Western blot analysis was performed on
both floating and adherent cells.
In vitro cell assays

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For in vitro studies drugs were prepared as follows: cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared
as 500 μg/ml in PBS, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) as 10 mg/ml in DMSO,
etoposide (Sigma-Aldrich) as 10 mM in DMSO, and verteporfin (Sigma-Aldrich) as 2mM in
DMSO. Radiation treatment was performed using a Mark I 137Cs γ irradiator (Shepherd).
Cell growth was measured following a 30 minute incubation in 90% crystal violet10%
methanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Fixed and stained cells were solubilized in methanol and
absorbance was detected at 590 nm. Cell death was measured by incubating adherent and
floating cells with 1μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and propidium iodide uptake
was evaluated by flow cytometry. Alternatively, cell viability was evaluated by 50% trypan
blue exclusion assay measured by manual and automated count (Bio-Rad TC10 automated
cell counter) in parallel. All cell-based assays are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD)
of at least three independent replicates.
Comet assay
DNA damage was detected by alkaline comet assay, according to a published procedure
(52). In brief, cells were treated, harvested, mixed in agarose gel, plated on a glass slide and
incubated at 4°C for 45-60 minutes in lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10
mM Tris, pH 10.0, Triton X-100 1% v/v,10% DMSO). The agarose gel slides were washed
to neutralize the Tris, applied for electrophoresis and the DNA was stained with propidium
iodide. The distance between the center of the DNA head and the end of the DNA tail, which
is called the comet tail length, was used as an indicator of DNA damage.
Histology and immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, and cut at 5
μm. Sections were then de-paraffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to heat-mediated antigen
unmasking in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidases were
quenched with 3% H2O2. Slides were then blocked for one hour with PBS 1% BSA, and
incubated overnight with the primary antibodies listed above. Sections were then incubated
in horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories), followed by
development in diaminobenzidine (Dako) and hemotoxylincounterstaining. Quantification of
the staining was performed using ImageJ software in a blinded fashion by analyzing 6

randomly selected fields per tissue of 4 to 6 samples per treatment. Results are expressed as
% positive nuclei per treatment ± SE; calculated with Immunoratio plugin for ImageJ as
previously described (53).
Human UCC tissue microarray (TMA)
Human UCC tissues analyzed were derived from the RPCI_GUCa06 tissue micro-array (149
cases, 3 cores per case, from 1995 to 2010) and Dr.Pili's collection of UCC cases (22
patients treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 2011 to 2013 under an Institutional
Review Board-approved protocol). Three independent investigators, GA (certified urological
pathologist), EC, and SK blindly examined all 171 samples and the final score was assigned
by evaluating consensus among the assessment of the three different cores from each
sample. Analysis for nuclear and cytosolic YAP staining was performed separately.

Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

All statements were confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Data are presented
as means ± SD for in vitro experiments and means ± SE for in vivo tumor weight. The
independent sample t-test or one-way ANOVA, with post-hoc pairwise comparisons made
using the t-test, was used to evaluate mean differences between groups. Overall and
recurrence-free survival data are presented using standard Kaplan-Meier methods, with
comparisons made between YAP levels using the log-rank test. Logistic regression was used
to develop propensity scores for YAP expression based on patient characteristics (age,
gender, race, histology, grade, and cancer history). Then Cox regression, stratified by
propensity quintile, was used to evaluate the association between the survival outcomes and
YAP while adjusting for patient characteristics. Hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals were obtained from model estimates. All tests are two-sided at a
significance level of 0.05.
