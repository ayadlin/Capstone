ABSTRACT
The constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT3) is frequently detected in clinical incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) but not in normal human hepatocytes. STAT3 signaling plays pivotal roles in
angiogenesis, survival, metastasis, and growth of HCC. Recent evidence suggests that
the blockade of aberrant STAT3 pathways can be exploited as a therapeutic strategy
for HCC. We have developed the novel small molecular STAT3 inhibitor LLL12 on the
basis of curcumin structure using computer-aided rational design. LLL12 has shown
antitumor activity in various solid tumors including breast, brain, pancreatic cancer,
and glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we hypothesized LLL12 inhibits
STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 (Y705) in HCC and show antitumor activity
in HCC in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that LLL12 selectively inhibited HCC cell
proliferation and induced apoptosis in SNU387, SNU398, SNU449, and Hep3B HCC
cells in vitro. Furthermore, LLL12 at 5 mg/kg/day significantly inhibited the growth
of SNU398 xenografts in nude mice. Collectively, our results indicate that LLL12 could
be used to target STAT3 for the effective prevention or treatment of HCC.

Recently, it was reported that STAT family
proteins, especially STAT3 play a crucial role in
the initiation of various cancer transformation and
progression. STAT3 was initially discovered as an
acute-phase response protein, suggesting its link to
inflammation. Also, most proinflammatory agents have
been shown to activate STAT3 [7, 8]. Mounting clinical
and epidemiologic evidence suggests that chronic
hepatitis viral infections, cirrhosis, are related to HCC
[9, 10]. Inflammation of the liver increases HCC risk by
promoting liver cirrhosis; indeed, the majority of HCC
cases begin with inflammation that leads to cirrhosis
and then to HCC [11]. Chronic inflammation and
aberrant activity of STAT3 cell signaling pathway play
important roles in hepatocarcinogenesis, for all these
reasons, STAT3 represents an attractive target in HCC
therapy. Thus, a blockade of aberrant STAT3 signaling
pathways can be exploited as a therapeutic strategy for
HCC [5, 12–14].

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer is the sixth most common malignancy
and the third-leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 90% of
all liver cancers. In the United States, the estimated new
liver cancer cases and deaths in 2014 account for 33,190
and 23,000, respectively [1]. HCC is a complex and
heterogeneous disease with various genomic alterations.
Several of aberrant activation of cell signaling cascades
such as the IL6/JAK/Stat3, EGFR, Ras/ERK, PI3K/
mTOR, and Wnt signaling pathways have been found in
HCC [2–6]. Currently, there is no effective therapy for
HCC, Surgical excision by partial or total hepatectomy
represents the only potentially curative therapy for HCC,
but many patients would be in an advanced stage of
disease at initial diagnosis. Most of these patients aren’t
candidates for surgery. Therefore, there is a pressing need
for the development of new approaches in HCC therapy.

RESULTS

We have developed a novel small molecular STAT3
inhibitor, LLL12, a substituted anthraquinone, which
synthesized based on curcumin structure using computeraided rational design (Figure 1A). Several study results
show curcumin has antitumor activity; however, curcumin
has low solubility.
We have reported LLL12 inhibits STAT3 activity
by selectively binding to its Src homology 2 domain and
show potent antitumor activity in breast cancer, brain
cancer, and pancreatic cancer [15–18] . In this article,
we explored the antitumor activities of LLL12 on HCC
in vitro and in vivo.

LLL12 inhibited growth and induced apoptosis
in various human HCC cell lines
To examine the cytotoxic activity of LLL12, the
human HCC cell lines SNU387, SNU398, SNU449, and
Hep3B were treated with LLL12 at serial concentrations
and assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. LLL12
significantly inhibited growth in all four cell lines in a dosedependent fashion (Figure 1B), with 50% inhibition (IC50)

Figure 1: (A) Structure of LLL12. (B) Effects of LLL12 on the proliferation of HCC cell lines. HCC cell lines (SNU387, SNU398,

SNU449, and Hep3B) were treated with DMSO or LLL12 with serial concentrations for 72 h. Proliferation was analyzed by MTT.
Proliferation values are listed as percentage of DMSO control. The IC50 values shown are mean ± standard deviation for three separate
experiments.

LLL12 suppressed nuclear translocation of
STAT3 in SNU398 and SNU387

values at 72 h of 0.84 ± 0.23 μM, 0.96 ± 0.18 μM, 4.38 ±
1.25 μM, and 2.39 ± 0.68 μM, respectively. Morphologic
assays of SNU387, SNU398, SNU449, and Hep3B treated
with LLL12 at 5 μM or 10 μM for 24 h showed that LLL12
inhibited cell growth and induced substantial apoptosis in
most of the cell lines at 10 μM (Figure 2).

Phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705) is required
for nuclear translocation, which plays central roles in
regulating STAT3 downstream target genes. To determine
whether LLL12 can suppress nuclear translocation of
STAT3, we performed an immunofluorescence assay
using monoclonal antibodies against p-STAT3 protein.
Images of fluorescence from cells stained with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) show that LLL12 inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation
and decreases the amount of p-STAT3 in the nucleus in
SNU398 and SNU387 cells stained with a monoclonal
anticytokeratin FITC-conjugated secondary antibody
(Figure 6). However, no significantly inhibitive effects of
LLL12 on nuclear translocation of STAT3 were observed
in SNU449 and Hep3B cells (data not shown), possibly
because SNU449 and Hep3B cells are more resistant to
LLL12 than the other HCC cell lines.

LLL12 inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3
and induced HCC cell apoptosis
RT-PCR results showed that LLL12 modulated the
expression of the cell cycle regulator gene cyclin D1; the
anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and DNMT1;
and the angiogenic gene product VEGF (Figure 3), all of
which are reportedly regulated by STAT3. The Western
blot results show that LLL12 decreased phosphorylation
of STAT3 protein (at Y705), decreased survivin and Bcl2 protein expression, and increased cleaved caspase-3
protein expression (Figure 4).

LLL12 caused the accumulation of HCC cells
in the G2/M phase

LLL12 suppressed the growth of SNU398
xenograft tumors in vivo

The effects of LLL12 on the HCC cell cycle were
examined by flow cytometry. The cells were synchronized by
incubation overnight in the absence of serum and then treated
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or LLL12 (10 μM) for 24 h.
The distributions of cells in each phase are shown in Figure 5.
There were significant increases in cells at the G2/M phase
after LLL12 exposure in SNU387, SNU398, and Hep3B cells.

To examine the antitumor activity of LLL12
in vivo, xenograft experiments were performed in
nude mice by implanting 5 × 106 SNU398 cells via
subcutaneous injection into each mouse and treating these
mice bearing tumors with either LLL12 (5 mg/kg) or with
a vehicle (DMSO) by intraperitoneal injection every day

for 17 days. LLL12 significantly inhibited tumor growth
compared with the control vehicle (Figure 7A). The body
weights of the mice in both groups have no significant
difference over the course of treatment (Figure 7B).

countries and the increase will likely continue for some
decades. Many genetic alterations and critical molecular
signaling pathways have been identified as contributing
to HCC development and progression. These pathways
include PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB and
STAT3 signaling pathway. However, the molecular
pathogenesis of HCC is not well-understood. As a result,
there are no effective mechanism-based therapies for
HCC. In STAT3 knockout mouse models, it has been
shown that STAT3 is required for tumorigenesis in mouse

intestine, skin and liver [19–21]. As compelling data
continue to accumulate STAT3 has linked inflammation
and oncogenes and phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705
is also frequently associated with a poor prognosis.
STAT3 has become an attractive target for treatment and
prevention of HCC.
LLL12, a small molecular inhibitor, was synthesized
according to curcumin structure. Computer models with
docking simulation showed that LLL12 binds directly to
phosphorylated Y705 binding site of monomers [16, 22]

and LLL12 does not inhibit STAT3 upstream kinase like
JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2. We found that LLL12 inhibited the
SNU387, SNU398, SNU449, and Hep3B human HCC cell
growth, arrested HCC cells in the G2/M phase and induced
these cell apoptosis in vitro. Our immunofluorostaining
results show LLL12 can effectively inhibit p-STAT3 nuclear
transfer in SNU 398 and SNU 387 cells, but the inhibition
of p-STAT3 nuclear localization was not observed in Hep3B
and SNU449 cancer cells. LLL12 decreased phosphorSTAT3 (Y705), cyclin D and survivin protein expression in
SNU398, SNU387 and Hep3B cells. However, we did not
observer LLL12 decreased cyclinD1 and survivin protein
expression in SNU449 cells. These results show SNU398
cells are more sensitive to LLL12 than SNU449 cells which
are consistent with the cell proliferative results that the
IC50 value of LLL12 on SNU449 cells is higher than on
other HCC cell lines. In SNU398 xenograft model, LLL12
at 5mg/kg can significantly inhibited tumor growth. The
various effects of LLL12 on these cell lines may be related
to the heterogeneous of HCC. However, STAT3 pathway
has interaction with many other cell signaling pathways like
NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. So, the combination
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of LLL12 with other multiple kinase inhibitors such as
sorafenib is deserved to be tested on HCC cell lines in the
future. On the other sides, Although, LLL12 have more
potent antitumor activity than curcumin, it still has relative
low solubility. So, how to increase LLL12 solubility may be
another strategy to improve the antitumor activity on HCC.
In conclusion, LLL12 show significant inhibitory
effects on STAT3 phosphorylation and activation, nuclear
accumulation, and transcriptional activity in HCC cell
lines. LLL12 also show significant antitumor activity in
nude mice implanted with SNU398 cells. LLL12 may
provide a novel strategy for HCC prevention and therapy

caspase-3 (Asp175) antibody, cyclin D1 antibody, survivin
antibody, and biotinylated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (14C10) rabbit antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA).

The MTT assay provides a quantitative determination
of viable cells. We seeded 3 × 103 cells in 96-well microplates
in complete culture medium in the absence or presence of
increasing serial dosages of LLL12 compound in triplicate.
Cells were cultured at 37°C for 72 h, and the number of
viable cells was measured by adding 50 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT
solution per well. After 4 h, the formazan crystals were
dissolved by adding 100 μl solution [23]. The absorbance was
read at 595 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
reader. IC50 values were calculated by SigmaPlot 9.0 software
(Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA ).

Cell cultures
The HCC cell lines SNU387, SNU398, SNU449,
and Hep3B were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas,
VA, USA). SNU398 and SNU449 cells were cultured
with Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, SNU387 cells
were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and Hep3B cells
were cultured with ATCC-formulated Eagle’s minimum
essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. One
hundred units of penicillin and streptomycin were added
to each cell culture media.

p-STAT3 antibody. Briefly, we seeded the SNU398 SNU387,
SNU449, and Hep3B cells in six-well plates, treated the cells
with LLL12 at the 5 μM for 24 h, and removed the media and
washed the cells three times with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) solution. The cells were then fixed with pre-cooled
menthol for 15 min. After washed with PBS, the coverslips
were incubated with the primary antibody (1:100) in PBS
with 3% goat serum albumin overnight at 4°C, washed with
PBS, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:100) in the dark at room temperature for 1 h.
For nuclear staining, the cells were stained with DAPI 1.5 μg/
ml for 5 min before examination. A fluorescence microscope
was used to visualize the cells stained with p-STAT3 antibody
and/or DAPI.

Western blot analysis

Cells from all four HCC lines were seeded in
100 × 20 mm dishes. Cells were synchronized by incubation
overnight in the absence of serum before DMSO or LLL12
(5 μM) was added, and then the cells were incubated for
24 h. Then, 1–2 × 106 single cells were collected and
washed with cold PBS, fixed with precooled 70% ethanol,
incubated on ice a minimum of 45 min. The cells were
then centrifuged, carefully aspirated from the supernatant,
and then these cells were re-suspended in propidium
iodide (final concentration, 40 μg/ml) and RNase A (final
concentration, 100 μg/ml) solution at a final cell density of
0.5 × 106 cells/ml. The suspension was incubated at 37°C
for 30 min prior to analysis by flow cytometry.

Cells from all four HCC lines were plated in dishes
100 mm in diameter, and after the cells had grown in a
monolayer to 70% confluence, the medium was replaced
with fresh medium containing DMSO or containing LLL12
(5 μM or 10 μM ). The cells were then cultured for 24 h
before they were harvested for Western blot analysis.
The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed
on ice for 10 min with radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1%
Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at
13,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min. The protein concentration of
supernatant was determined with Bicinchoninic acid protein
assay kit (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA), the lysate proteins
were mixed with 4 × SDS gel sample buffer and separated
with 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel
proteins were transferred by Western blot to Hybond

Total RNA was extracted from cells from all four HCC
lines treated with LLL12 (5 μM, or 10 μM ) or DMSO for
24 h using RNeasy Kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA).
Reverse transcription was carried out at 42°C for 50 minutes
using oligo(dT) sequences as primers. Two microliters of
this reverse transcription product was then used for RT-PCR.
RT-PCR was carried out in 25 μl total volume of reaction
buffer. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of the
cDNA were sense and antisense, which were synthesized
by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA)
(Table 1). After the initial denaturation of 5 min at 95°C,
RT-PCR was performed for 25 cycles in an Eppendorf
Mastercycler Gradient Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf, NY,
USA). Ten microliters of each RT-PCR product were run on
a 2% (w/v) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Gel
images were captured using Chemigenius Gel Documentation
System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).

approved by the American Association for Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care. The mice were injected
subcutaneously in the left flank area with 5 × 106 SNU398

mm3 in size, the mice were randomized into control and
treatment groups. The mice were then given LLL12 at
5 mg/kg or a vehicle (DMSO) intraperitoneal injection
every day. Tumor volume (V ) was calculated according
to the formula V = 0.5 × a2 × b, where a is the smallest
superficial diameter and b is the largest superficial
diameter. The Student t-test was used to analyze in vivo
growth patterns of the tumors and of total body weights.
