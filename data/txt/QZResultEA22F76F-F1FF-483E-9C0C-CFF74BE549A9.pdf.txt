ABSTRACT
Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) are very common, aggressive
tumors, and are often associated with alcohol and tobacco abuse. Because ESCCs
exhibit high recurrence rates and are diagnosed at late stages, identification of
prognostic and drug targets for prevention and treatment is critical. We used the
4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) murine model of oral carcinogenesis and the
Meadows-Cook model of alcohol abuse to assess changes in the expression of
molecular markers during the initial stages of ESCC. Combining these two models,
which mimic chronic alcohol and tobacco abuse in humans, we detected increased
cellular proliferation (EGFR and Ki67 expression), increased canonical Wnt signaling
and downstream elements (β-catenin, FoxM1, and S100a4 protein levels), changes in
cellular adhesive properties (reduced E-cadherin in the basal layer of the esophageal
epithelium), and increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38. Additionally,
we found that treatment with ethanol alone increased the numbers of epithelial
cells expressing solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter, member 1)
(SLC2A1) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), and increased the phosphorylation of
p38. Thus, we identified both 4-NQO- and ethanol-specific targets in the initial stages
of esophageal carcinogenesis, which should lead to the development of potential
markers and therapeutic targets for human ESCC.

INTRODUCTION

most common in terms of new cases and the fourth in
terms of estimated deaths in the United States during 2012
[3]. Moreover, ESCC represents one of the top 10 types
of cancer-related deaths in males between the ages of 40
and 59 years [3]. Although there have been advances in
the diagnosis, operative techniques, and prognosis, the 5
year relative survival rate (5-YRSR) still remains low at
19% [3]. The low 5-YRSR for ESCC can be attributed
primarily to diagnosis at an advanced stage, characterized
by invasion and metastasis to the lymphatic system and
remote organs at the time of diagnosis [4]. Identification

Cancers of the esophagus, which can be divided into
squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and adenocarcinomas,
are the eighth most common malignancy worldwide,
affecting over 450, 000 people [1]. Esophageal cancers
typically are classified as a subgroup of cancers of the
upper aerodigestive tract (UADT), which also include
malignancies of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx [2].
Additionally, esophageal cancers can be grouped with
malignancies that affect the digestive system as the fifth

of predictive biomarkers to identify and diagnose ESCC
at earlier stages, before the observation of frank tumors,
would be beneficial for patient survival.
Alcohol and tobacco abuse are major risk factors for
the development of ESCC and these two social risk factors
may have a synergistic effect on the initiation of ESCC [5,
6]. The odds ratio (OR) for oral cavity cancers of chronic
tobacco smokers and alcohol drinkers is 50 to 1, relative to
never smokers and drinkers [5]. The International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that
chronic alcohol consumption can lead to the development
of cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, and liver [7]. The
role of alcohol in the initiation and development of ESCC
is closely related to the metabolism of ethanol. Alcohol
dehydrogenases (ADHs) oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde,
whose concentrations in alcoholic beverages can reach
approximately 200 mM [8]. Acetaldehyde is then
metabolized into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase-2
(ALDH2) [7]. Acetaldehyde, a genotoxic compound,
acts as a carcinogen in humans by inducing mutations,
promoting sister chromatid exchange, and interfering
with DNA synthesis and repair [7, 9]. The formation
of acetaldehyde-derived DNA adducts, such as N2-(3hydroxybutyl)-dG, α-methyl-ϒ-OH-propano-dG, and N2(4-hydroxybutyl)-dG, induces DNA polymerase errors,
thus initiating mutations that silence tumor suppressors
and/or activate oncogenes [2, 10].
	 Regarding tobacco abuse, the IARC has
determined that cigarette smoke contains over 60 putative
carcinogens, with 15 of these, including polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and N-nitrosamines,
confirmed as carcinogenic in humans [11, 12]. The
carcinogens in cigarette smoke can be metabolized by
cytochrome P450 enzymes into water-soluble forms,
generating DNA adducts [13]. For instance, the major
adduct of the PAH, Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), generates
G-to-T transversions in DNA. These G-to-T transversions
often are preferred sites for the formation of CpG
islands, which have been linked to the silencing of tumor
suppressor genes [14-16].
To understand the roles of chronic tobacco and
alcohol abuse in the initiation of ESCC, we have combined
the Meadows-Cook and 4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) carcinogenesis models. The Meadows-Cook murine
model simulates the effects of chronic alcohol abuse of
humans in the oral cavity, the esophagus, and the liver
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[17]. The 4-NQO murine model of oral and esophageal
carcinogenesis in which the carcinogen, 4-NQO, is a
surrogate for tobacco [18], has been extensively used
to analyze cancers of the oral cavity and esophagus in
animal models [19-21]. We and others have used these two
models to characterize the molecular effects of chronic
alcohol and tobacco abuse in the oral cavity [22-24]. We
combined these two models to simulate chronic alcohol
and tobacco abuse in humans, to investigate the molecular
alterations present during the early stages of ESCC, and to
identify ethanol-specific targets in ESCC carcinogenesis.
Here we show that changes in the expression of molecular
markers involved in cellular proliferation, oncogenic
signaling, cellular adhesion, and cellular metabolism occur
during the initial stages of ESCC.

RESULTS
Histopathological analyses of esophagi from mice
subjected to the 4-NQO murine model for oral
carcinogenesis and the Meadows-Cook model for
chronic alcohol abuse.
Changes in the histopathology of the epithelia of
the esophagi from each experimental group, V.C./Untr.
(n=12), V.C./EtOH (n=15), 4-NQO/Untr. (n=15), and
4-NQO/EtOH (n=18) were determined by a board-certified
pathologist blinded to the sample identities. Esophagi from
the V.C./Untr. and the V.C./EtOH experimental groups did
not harbor any pathologic abnormalities in any regions of
the tissue (Fig. 1A, and Table 1). In the esophagi of mice
treated only with 4-NQO (4-NQO/Untr.), we observed
hyperplasia, low-, and high-grade dysplasia – 6.7%,
86.7% and 6.7%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, mice treated with 4-NQO and subsequently
with ethanol (4-NQO/EtOH) displayed more high-grade
dysplasia, 16.7% (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Although we
did not observe any esophageal SCC at these early time
points (11 weeks after 4-NQO administration), there were
statistically significant levels of low-grade dysplasia in the
4-NQO/Untr. (86.7%, p<0.001) and 4-NQO/EtOH (83.3%,
p<0.001) groups compared to the V.C./Untr. group (Table
1). Also, these histological data suggest an additive effect
of ethanol to SCC carcinogenesis induced by 4-NQO.

against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
Ki67. EGFR expression has been linked to increased cell
proliferation in several types of cancer [25] and Ki67 is a
marker that also indicates actively proliferating cells [26].
We found that the percentage of EGFR(+) cells from the
V.C./Untr. control group (~32%) was statistically lower
than those of the 4-NQO/Untr. (~55%, p<0.001) and
4-NQO/EtOH (~56%, p<0.001) experimental groups
(Fig. 1B, 1D). Compared to the V.C./Untr. group, we
did not detect any statistically significant changes in
the percentage of EGFR(+) cells in the V.C./EtOH
experimental group (~30%) (Fig. 1B, 1D). Also, there
were more EGFR(+) cells in the suprabasal layers of
the esophagus in the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH
experimental groups compared to the V.C./Untr. group
(Fig. 1B).
We observed a similar staining profile for Ki67 in
the esophagus. The Ki67 staining profiles were as follows:
~9% (V.C./Untr.), ~10% (V.C./EtOH), ~31% (4-NQO/
Untr.), and ~32% (4-NQO/EtOH) (Fig. 1C, 1E), with
the Ki67 staining percentages of the 4-NQO/Untr. and
4-NQO/EtOH experimental groups compared to the V.C./
Untr. group statistically significant (p<0.001) (Fig. 1E).
We did not observe any statistically significant differences
in the V.C./EtOH group compared to the V.C./Untr. group

Compared to the V.C./Untr. group, 16.7% (p<0.01) of the
esophagi analyzed from the 4-NQO/EtOH group displayed
significant, high-grade dysplasia (Table 1). These data
suggest that ethanol can increase 4-NQO-induced ESCC
through modifications in the epithelium of the esophagus.

Treatment with 4-NQO alone and treatment with
4-NQO followed by ethanol increase cellular
proliferation in the esophagus.
We measured the cellular proliferation of the
epithelial cells in the esophagus by quantitative
immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies directed

3A). Reduced E-cadherin expression has been linked
to tumorigenesis by inducing invasive and metastatic
properties in transformed cells [27, 28]. We detected
differences in the percentages of E-cadherin(+) cells
within the basal and suprabasal layers of the epithelium
(Figs. 2A, 3A). There was an increase of E-cadherin(+)
cells in the suprabasal layers of the 4-NQO/Untr. (~2.5
fold, p<0.05) and 4-NQO/EtOH (~4 fold, p<0.001) groups
(Fig. 3A). Also, we detected decreases in the percentages
of E-cadherin(+) cells within the basal layer of esophagi
compared to the V.C./Untr. (set at 1.0) for the 4-NQO/
Untr. (~0.5 fold, p<0.05) and 4-NQO/EtOH groups (~0.5,
p<0.05) (Fig. 3A).

Suprabasal expression of E-cadherin is increased
in the esophagi of 4-NQO and 4-NQO plus ethanol
treated mice.
Next, we determined the changes in the localization
of E-cadherin in the epithelia of the esophagi in the V.C./
EtOH, 4-NQO/Untr., and 4-NQO/EtOH experimental
groups compared to the V.C./Untr. group (Figs. 2A, and

was observed throughout the entire epithelia (basal and
suprabasal layers) in the esophagi of the 4-NQO/Untr.
and 4-NQO/EtOH groups (Fig. 2B). This staining pattern
was in contrast to the exclusively basal layer expression
of β-catenin in the V.C./Untr. and V.C./EtOH groups
(Fig. 2B). Compared to the V.C./Untr. group, the average
percentages of β-catenin(+) cells in the epithelial layer as
fold changes were as follows: V.C./EtOH (~1.1), 4-NQO/
Untr. (~3.0, p<0.05) and 4-NQO/EtOH (~3.8, p<0.05)
(Fig. 3A). Also, the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH
groups showed a major reduction in phosphorylated
β-catenin, which indicates activation of the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 6A and B). Compared to the

The activation of the canonical (β-catenin
dependent) Wnt pathway and modifications of the

Calcium Binding Protein A4 (S100A4) (Figs 2B-D, 3A).
In addition, we investigated changes in the transcript
levels of one canonical Wnt ligand (Wnt3a), noncanonical
Wnt ligands (Wnt5a and Wnt7a), and Frizzled (Fzd)

compared to the V.C./Untr. group (set at 1.0) (Fig. 4A,

Also,
the
acidification
of
the
tumor
microenvironment by carbonic anhydrases (CAs) has
been implicated in tumor initiation and progression
via activation of angiogenic factors, increased cellular
migration, and reduced cell-cell adhesion [34]. Similar to
the SLC2A1 staining profile, we observed CAIX(+) cells
in both basal and suprabasal layers in the epithelia of the
esophagi in all four experimental groups (Fig. 4B, 4D).
Based on the average percentages of cells stained, the fold
changes in CAIX staining in the esophagi were as follows:
~2.5 (V.C./EtOH; p<0.01), ~3.2 (4-NQO/Untr.; p<0.001),
and ~4.7 (4-NQO/EtOH; p<0.001) compared to V.C./
Untr., set at 1.0 (Fig. 4D). These increases in SLC2A1
(Fig. 4A, 4C) and CAIX (Fig. 4B, 4D) in the V.C./EtOH
group could potentially be employed to detect the early
stages of ESCC.

V.C./Untr. group (set at 1.0), the levels of phosphorylated
β-catenin were as follows: V.C./EtOH (~0.97), 4-NQO/
Untr. (~0.4, p<0.001), and 4-NQO/EtOH (~0.45, p<0.001)
(Fig. 6B).
FoxM1 has been linked to human epithelial stem/
progenitor expansion [30] and to advancing elements of
the downstream canonical Wnt pathway [31]. Here, we
found that administration of 4-NQO (4-NQO/Untr.) and
4-NQO followed by ethanol (4-NQO/EtOH) resulted
in increased FoxM1(+) cells in the epithelia in both the
basal and suprabasal layers of the esophagus (Fig. 2C).
The staining profiles of suprabasal FoxM1(+) cells in the
4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH groups were similar to
the suprabasal expression of β-catenin (Fig. 2 and Fig.
3A). Compared to the V.C./Untr. group (set at 1.0), the
percentages of FoxM1(+) cells in the epithelia (as fold
changes) were as follows: V.C./EtOH (~1.2), 4-NQO/Untr.
(~2.3, p<0.05) and 4-NQO/EtOH (~3.1, p<0.05) (Fig. 3A).
S100A4, another downstream target of the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway, can promote cellular metastasis
[32]. Based on our IHC analyses, we found 3.1 (p<0.01)
and 2.9 (p<0.01) fold increases for S100A4(+) cells in the
esophagi of 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH treated mice,
respectively (Figs. 2D, 3A). Also, we observed a similar,
statistically significant trend in S100A4 transcript levels in
these treatment groups (Fig. 3B).
To understand further the role of canonical and
noncanonical Wnt signaling in the initiation of ESCC,
we measured the transcript levels of Wnt ligands and Fzd
receptors (Fig. 3B). As expected, we detected increases
in Wnt3a transcript levels in mice treated with 4-NQO
(4-NQO/Untr.) (~3.1 fold, p<0.01) and 4-NQO followed
by ethanol (4-NQO/EtOH) (~3.5 fold, p<0.01; Fig. 3B).
Also, we observed a significant decrease in transcripts of
Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, in the 4-NQO/Untr.
and 4-NQO/EtOH groups (Fig. 3B). However, we did not
observe any changes in Wnt7a (another noncanonical Wnt
ligand) transcript levels among the four groups (Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, there were large increases in the transcript
levels of Fzd2 and Fzd6, noncanonical Fzd receptors, in
the esophagi of mice from the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/
EtOH treatment groups (Fig. 3B). These results show
that the administration of 4-NQO can modify several
markers of the canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling
pathways.

β-Catenin, FoxM1, and SLC2A1 protein levels are
similarly increased in human ESCC.
Using a human ESCC tissue microarray, we
investigated the protein levels of β-catenin, FoxM1, and
SLC2A1 in the esophagi of human patients diagnosed
with ESCC (Fig. 5). Based on immunohistochemical
(IHC) analysis of the human ESCC tissue microarrays,
the average fold increases for these three targets in the
malignant tissues were as follows: ~3.2 (β-catenin;
p<0.001), ~3.1 (FoxM1; p<0.001), and 6.3 (SLC2A1;
p<0.001), compared to normal tissue (set at 1.0) (Fig.
5B, 5D, 5F). The malignant tissue sections from the
clinical microarrays were characterized as either
moderately-differentiated or poorly-differentiated ESCC
(Supplementary Table 2).

The administration of 4-NQO and 4-NQO
followed by ethanol increases phosphorylated
ERK 1/2 levels and both 4-NQO and ethanol
treatments increase the phosphorylation of p38.
The development and progression of the early stages
of tumorigenesis can be influenced by the phosphorylation
activities in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways [35]. We investigated the changes in the
phosphorylation levels of ERK 1/2 and p38. Compared
to the V.C./Untr. group (set at 1.0), we detected 3.8
(p<0.001) and 3.2 (p<0.001) fold increases in the levels of
phosphorylated ERK 1/2 in the esophagi of mice from the
4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH groups, respectively (Fig.
6A, 6B). In addition, we showed that the phosphorylation
of p38 may be a target of tumorigenesis induced by
4-NQO and potentially by ethanol. Compared to the V.C./

SLC2A1 (GLUT1) and CAIX positive epithelial
cells are increased in the esophagi from mice
treated with ethanol and 4-NQO.
Solute carrier family 2A (facilitated glucose
transporter, member 1) [SLC2A1; also known as glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT1)] protein is increased in kidney, oral
cavity, breast, and prostate cancers [33]. From our IHC
analyses, we detected increases in SLC2A1(+) cells in the

weeks of 4-NQO administration so that we could analyze
the early events in esophageal carcinogenesis. We show
that the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH treatments
induce major changes in the architecture of the epithelium
(Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Compared to the V.C./Untr. group,
we measured increased levels of low-grade dysplasia
in the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH groups and
increased levels of high-grade dysplasia in the 4-NQO/
EtOH group (Table 1). Thus, ethanol enhanced the early
steps (hyperplasia and dysplasia) of 4-NQO-induced
carcinogenesis in the esophagus.
To analyze cell proliferation during the initiation of
ESCC, we used quantitative IHC to measure the staining
of EGFR and Ki67 in the esophagus (Fig. 1B-E). Both
EGFR [25] and Ki67 [26] have been used extensively in
IHC analyses as markers to characterize proliferation in
cancers of the oral cavity and esophagus in both humans
and mice. In both the V.C./Untr. and V.C./EtOH groups,
EGFR(+) (Fig. 1B, 1D) and Ki67(+) (Fig. 1C, 1E) cells
were limited to the basal layer. In the 4-NQO/Untr. and
4-NQO/EtOH groups, in contrast, we detected suprabasal
EGFR staining (Fig. 1B). We previously reported
increases in these markers in the suprabasal layers of the
tongues of mice in both the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/
EtOH experimental groups [24]. Thus, ESCC induced by
4-NQO administration could involve horizontal expansion
of epithelial basal stem cells, which has been demonstrated
in the tongue [23] and the skin [36].

of downstream factors involved in tumorigenesis, such
as Cyclin D1 and c-Jun [39]. We measured increased
numbers of murine esophageal cells that were β-catenin,
FoxM1, and S100A4 positive by IHC (Figs. 2, 3), and
we found reduced levels of phosphorylated β-catenin
protein by Western blotting (Fig. 6), similar to what we
demonstrated in the tongue [24]. Additionally, we detected
increased numbers of cells that express β-catenin(+) (Fig.
5A, B) and FoxM1(+) cells (Fig. 5C, D) in human patients
diagnosed with ESCC.
Increased FoxM1 expression has been implicated
in many types of cancers, including HNSCC and ESCC
[40]. More specifically, high expression of FoxM1 induces
changes in DNA methylation and epigenetic remodeling
programs to maintain stem/progenitor cell renewal and
to antagonize pathways inducing differentiation [41, 42].
Modifications in the proliferative nature of stem/progenitor
cells have been implicated in the initiation and recurrence
of several cancers, including HNSCC and OSCC [43,
44]. FoxM1 also directly interacts with β-catenin during
glioma tumorigenesis to induce nuclear localization of
β-catenin, a clear indication of canonical Wnt signaling
activation [31]. Moreover, FoxM1 has been linked to
the development of chemotherapeutic drug resistance.
Additionally, Oncomine microarray analyses show that
FoxM1, along with other Forkhead box transcript levels
(e.g. FoxK1 and FoxK2) are greatly increased in human
ESCC (Supplementary Table 3). Further analysis of the
Forkhead box transcript and protein levels could identify
additional roles of this family of transcription factors in
esophageal tumorigenesis.
Metastasis is a major characteristic of late stage
tumorigenesis in ESCC and HNSCC. In nontransformed
cells, the S100A subfamily of proteins influences calcium
homeostasis, which controls cell survival, differentiation,
and metabolism [45]. In the esophagus, S100A4 may
contribute to the metastatic stage by inducing the
phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K, and
by interactions with myosin IIA and various matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) [46]. Although we did not
observe metastasis at the time point assayed in our model,
we did detect increased numbers of cells expressing
S100A4, both at the protein (Figs 2D, 3A) and mRNA
levels (Fig. 3B), in the esophagi of the 4-NQO/Untr. and
4-NQO/EtOH treated mice.
Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
can induce neoplastic transformation [47]. However,
the definitive role for the noncanonical Wnt signaling
pathway in cancer remains controversial. Reports
have demonstrated both over- and underexpression in
Wnt5a transcripts, a key noncanonical Wnt ligand, in
tumorigenesis [48]. We detected reduced levels of Wnt5a
transcripts, but increased Fzd2 and Fzd6 noncanonical
Wnt receptors, in the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH
groups compared to the V.C./Untr. group (Fig. 3B). Also,
we did not detect any changes in the transcript levels

4-NQO and 4-NQO followed by ethanol
treatments modify E-cadherin expression in the
esophagus.
In normal tissues E-cadherin mediates cell-cell
adhesion and functions as a tumor suppressor; however,
its deregulation can initiate epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis [37]. Often,
reduced E-cadherin expression occurs at the genetic
level through mutations and gene hypermethylation [38].
Here, we detected approximately a 50% reduction in the
number of epithelial basal cells that are E-cadherin(+) in
the 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH groups compared to
the V.C./Untr. group (Figs. 2A, 3A). In the 4-NQO/Untr.
and 4-NQO/EtOH groups we detected increased numbers
of E-cadherin stained cells in the suprabasal layers (Figs.
2A, 3A).

Administration of 4-NQO activates the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway during the initial stages
of ESCC.
Increased activity of the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway, indicated by the nuclear localization of β-catenin
and its interaction with Wnt responsive elements, has
been characterized in ESCC via increased expression

of Wnt7a (Fig. 3B), another noncanonical Wnt ligand.
Oncomine data from human ESCC specimens show
that Wnt5a (Supplementary Table 4) mRNA is reduced
and Fzd2 and Fzd6 (Supplementary Table 3) transcripts
are increased, similar to our data in this murine model.
The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway may prevent
early transformation of cells at the expense of canonical
Wnt signaling; however, the noncanonical pathway can
enhance cellular invasiveness after transformation [49].
Additional investigations will have to be conducted
to delineate the role of noncanonical Wnt signaling in
carcinogen-induced ESCC.

contribution of chronic alcohol consumption to the initial
stages of ESCC.

The administration of 4-NQO followed by ethanol
is associated with induction of MAPK pathways
through the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and p38 .
The members of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) family can mediate various cellular
functions and responses that are induced by growth
factors, hormones, and cellular stress. Aberrant regulation
of MAPK signaling is seen in many cancer types,
including ESCC. The four major MAPK pathways include
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Big MAP
kinase-1 (BMK1), p38, and c-Jun N terminal kinase
(JNK), where the ERK and BMK1 pathways respond to
various growth factors and hormone signals and the JNK
and p38 pathways respond to extracellular stress signals
[53]. Here, we detected higher levels of phosphorylated
ERK 1/2 after the administration of 4-NQO and 4-NQO/
EtOH (Fig. 6A, 6B), similar to what we and others
reported in the oral cavity and esophagus [24, 54-56].
We measured increased levels of phosphorylated
p38 in the V.C./EtOH group compared to the V.C./Untr.
group (Fig. 6A, 6B). We also observed increased levels
of total p38 in the oral cavities of the V.C./EtOH group
[24]. The activation of p38 through phosphorylation on
Thr180 and Tyr182 residues has been associated with
the angiogenic, invasive, and migratory properties of
ESCC [57]. p38 contributes to immune and inflammatory
responses by causing the release of tumor-related
cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ESCC [57, 58].
Also, activation of the p38 pathway may influence the
activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in
transformed cell lines and embryonic stem cells [59,
60]. More specifically, p38 inhibits the phosphorylating
capacity of GSK-3β, which participates in the degradation
of β-catenin by phosphorylating the Ser33/37 and Thr42
residues of β-catenin [60]. Our study shows that the
activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, possibly through a
response to extracellular stress, may be an ethanol-specific
effect in the initiation of ESCC.

Ethanol increases SLC2A1- and CAIX- positive
epithelial cells in the esophagus.
In many types of the cancer, hypoxia (characterized
by a low concentration of oxygen) can induce changes
in the tumor microenvironment that switch cellular
metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to
glycolysis, thus increasing glycogen synthesis and the
use of glutamine instead of glucose for energy production
[50]. In addition, hypoxia is often associated with low
survival rates, poor responses to chemotherapy, and
higher resistance to anticancer drugs in many cancers
[50]. Although there is substantial information regarding
SLC2A1 (also known as GLUT1) and CAIX expression in
HNSCC and other malignancies [51, 52], the information
is more limited for animal models of ESCC.
We detected increased percentages of SLC2A1(+)
cells in the esophagi of mice after the administration of
ethanol, 4-NQO, and 4-NQO followed by ethanol (Fig.
4A, 4C). Even though there are very few reports linking
elevations in SLC2A1 to ESCC, published microarray data
show that SLC2A1 is in the top 10% of overexpressed
transcripts in two separate data sets generated from ESCC
patients (Supplementary Table 5). Transcripts of other
SLC family members involved in cell metabolism, eg.
SLC2A2 (GLUT2), SLC2A3 (GLUT3), and SLC16A1
(monocarboxylic acid transporter 1; MCT), are also
overexpressed in ESCC patients (Supplementary Table 5).
However, the levels and duration of alcohol and/or tobacco
consumption by these patients were not reported in these
data sets. Finally, a similar increase in SLC2A1 protein
levels in the esophagi of 4-NQO/Untr. and 4-NQO/EtOH
treated mice also was observed in the malignant tissue
from a human ESCC tissue microarray (Fig. 5E, 5F).
We also identified CAIX as a possible target of
alcohol exposure in ESCC, as we measured increases in
the percentages of CAIX(+) epithelial cells expressing
CAIX protein in the esophagi of mice in the V.C./EtOH,
4-NQO/Untr., and 4-NQO/EtOH groups compared to
the V.C./Untr. group (Fig. 4B, 4D). These data implicate
glucose metabolism (i.e. SLC2A1) and carbonic
anhydrases (i.e. CAIX) as potential biomarkers for the

CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have combined the 4-NQO model of oral
carcinogenesis and the Meadows-Cook model of
chronic alcohol abuse to investigate the molecular
changes associated with the initial stages of esophageal
carcinogenesis. In both the tongue [23, 24] and in the
esophagus, we saw increased cell proliferation, increased
expression of canonical Wnt signaling markers, and
changes in the expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis

Additionally, we detected similar expression patterns of
makers involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
and glycolysis in malignant esophageal tissue derived from
human ESCC patients. Because of the similarities of the
esophageal epithelial tissue between humans and mice the
combination of the 4-NQO and Meadows-Cook models
serves as an excellent model to determine prognostic
markers for early ESCC and to analyze potential drugs for
prevention or treatment of ESCC.

Protein targets were detected using paraffinembedded sections of murine esophagi, as described
[24]. Additionally, IHC analysis was performed using a
commercially available ESCC tissue microarray (Cat#
BC02021, U.S. Biomax, Inc., Rockville, MD), which
contained normal and malignant tissue samples. Patient
information (age, sex, pathology diagnosis, and grade) can
be found in Supplemental Table 2 and corresponding H&E
stained images can be found at http://www.biomax.us/
tissue-arrays/Esophagus/BC2021. After deparaffinization,
rehydration, and citrate-based antigen unmasking, the
slides were blocked with mouse anti-IgG blocking solution
(Cat# MKB-2213, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA), rat anti-IgG blocking solution (Cat# CTS005, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or PBS containing 10% goat
serum and 0.1% Tween (for rabbit primary antibodies).
Following primary mouse, rat, or rabbit primary antibody
incubation, the slides were incubated with secondary
antibodies from the M.O.M (Cat# MKB-2213, Vector
Laboratories), Rat Cell & Tissue Staining HRP-Dab (Cat#
CTS005, R&D Systems), or SuperPicture HRP Polymer
Conjugate (Cat# 87-8963, Life Technologies) kits,
respectively. Details regarding the antibodies used can be
found in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Animals and treatments
As described in [24], eight week old female wildtype C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
were subjected to the combined 4-NQO murine model of
oral carcinogenesis and Meadows-Cook model of chronic
ethanol abuse. Four experimental groups were randomized
as follows: Vehicle Control/Untreated (V.C./Untr.), Vehicle
Control/Ethanol (V.C./EtOH), 4-NQO/Untreated (4-NQO/
Untr.), and 4-NQO/Ethanol (4-NQO/EtOH). Depending
on the experimental group, the mice were administered
propylene glycol (V.C.) or 100 µg/ml 4-NQO (Cat#
N8141, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 weeks [18, 23], and
then given either normal water (Untr.) or water containing
20% (w:v) ethanol (EtOH) for 10 weeks after an one week
ethanol acclimation period [24]. This experiment was
performed twice, with experiments one and two utilizing
5 and 15 mice per treatment group, respectively.

Semiquantitative IHC analysis
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal
sections (3-5 from each experimental group) were
photographed at 200x magnification. Using ImageJ 1.48v
(http://rsp.info.nih.gov/ij), the photographs were resolved
into separate RGB channels, where the green channel was
used for analysis. Within each photo, only the epithelial
layer was selected for analysis by setting the threshold
levels to a point were DAB(+) cells were selected. Then
ImageJ calculated the total area of the DAB(+) cells
compared to the total area of the epithelial layer. The
results are shown as the fold changes in percent of the
epithelial layer positive for the stain by comparing to
the photographs taken from the V.C./Untr. experimental
groups, where the percent positive was set at 1.0.

Esophagus tissue processing
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained, paraffinembedded cross sections of the esophagi were analyzed
by a trained pathologist (T.S.) blinded to the four
experimental groups. The sections of the esophagi
from the H&E-stained slides were classified as normal,
hyperplasic, dysplastic (low- or high-grade), or squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC).

RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and QRTPCR

Western blotting analysis

Esophagi were homogenized in TRIzol (Cat#
155596-026, Life Technologies, Norwalk, CT) and total
RNA extraction was performed as described by the
manufacturer. QRT-PCR was performed after reverse
transcription of the total RNA (1 µg). Primer pairs used
for the QRT-PCR can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Total protein lysates (30 µg) were extracted from the
esophagi of three mice from each experimental group and
Western blotting was performed three times as described
in [24]. Details regarding the antibodies used for Western
blotting can be found in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Statistical analyses
The Fisher’s exact probability test was used to
determine significance among the distribution of dysplasia
in each treatment group. Statistical significance for IHC,
QRT-PCR, and Western blotting was determined by using
analysis of variation (ANOVA) and the Tukey posthoc
tests (Prism 4, GraphPad Software, Inc.). ANOVA and
Tukey posthoc tests were performed by comparing the
V.C./Untr. control group to the V.C./EtOH, 4-NQO/Untr.,
and 4-NQO/EtOH experimental groups, where statistical
significance was set at p<0.05. For these analyses, the fold
changes in protein levels were assessed by normalizing the
means of each group to the V.C./Untr. group. Note, only
the average staining intensities were used to determine
statistical significance for the IHC analyses.
