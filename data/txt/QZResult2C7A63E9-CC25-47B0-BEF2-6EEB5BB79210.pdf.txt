ABSTRACT
Background and aims: The pathogenesis of oral-intestinal allergy syndrome
(OIAS) has not been well understood. Published data indicate that galectin (Gal)
1 has immune regulatory functions. This study tests a hypothesis that Gal1 inhibits
oral-intestinal allergy syndrome.
Methods: Mice were sensitized to peanut extracts (PE) via the buccal mucosa
with or without using Gal1 together.
Results: Upon re-exposure to specific antigen, the OIAS mice showed the systemic
allergic response, the oral allergic reactions, and intestinal allergic inflammation,
including increases in serum histamine, drop of the core temperature, higher levels
of PE-specific IgE and interleukin (IL)-4. Increases in mast cell and eosinophil in the
oral mucosa and intestinal mucosa were also observed. The OIAS was inhibited by
co-administration with Gal1 via a mechanism of suppressing micro RNA (miR)-98 and
reversing the expression of IL-10 in CD14+ cells in the intestine.
Conclusions: The OIAS can be induced by applying specific antigens to the oral
mucosa, which can be inhibited by co-administration with Gal1.

advanced rapidly in the recent years, the pathogenesis of
allergic disorders is still obscure.
Interleukin (IL)-10 is an important immune
regulatory cytokine. One of the functions of IL-10 is to
suppress the inflammatory cytokine production [5]. IL-10
can be produced by a number of immune cells, including
regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, T helper (Th) 2
cells and monocytes [6, 7]. Monocytes can differentiate
into dendritic cells or macrophages and play important
role in immunity. Published data indicate that a fraction
of monocyte expresses IL-10 that possesses immune
regulatory functions [5]. Whether are IL-10-expression
monocytes dysfunction in the oral allergy syndrome is
to be investigated. It is reported that micro RNA (miR)98 suppresses the IL-10 expression in macrophages
[8]. miRs are single strand non-coding RNA chain with
18-22 nucleotides in length. The miRs regulate target

INTRODUCTION
The oral allergy syndrome is a common
phenomenon. It belongs to the contact allergic response
that occurs upon contacting specific antigens. The
syndrome includes itching and swelling of the lips, palate
and tongue, usually after eating the offending foods [1].
Thus, oral allergy syndrome is also considered a form of
food allergy [2]. In some cases, oral allergic responses
occur together with throat allergy and called the oral
allergy syndrome [3]. Some patients with oral allergy are
also allergic to pollen and have hay fever, implicating
some antigens in foods and fruits is structurally similar
to pollen [4]. One of the clinical features of oral allergy
syndrome is the local mucosal edema. In the rare cases,
the edema in the throat may cause difficult breathing, or
even asphyxiation. Although the research about allergy has

gene expression post transcriptionally. Whether IL-10expression monocytes dysfunction plays a role in the oral
allergy syndrome is to be investigated.
Published data indicate that galectin-1 (Gal1) is
involved in the regulation of immune functions [9].
Whether Gal1 can alleviate oral allergy has not been
investigated. Since some foods can be the offending
antigens of oral allergy [10], we hypothesize that oral
allergy and intestinal allergy may concomitantly occur, a
phenomenon may be designated the “oral-intestinal allergy
syndrome (OIAS)”. To test this, we sensitized mice by
application of antigens to the mouse buccal mucosa. The
mice showed allergic responses in the oral mucosa as well
as intestinal mucosa. The OIAS symptoms were inhibited
by Gal1.

were assessed. The results showed that high infiltration of
eosinophils and mast cells (Supplementary Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure 2 in supplemental materials) in the
oral mucosa and intestinal mucosa. The PE-specific IgE
was detected in the sera. Compared to control mice, the
sensitized mice showed higher levels of serum histamine
and IL-4. In addition, 30 min after exposure to the PE,
the drop of core temperature and diarrhea were observed
in the sensitized mice (Figure 1). The data indicate
that sensitizing the oral mucosa can induce allergic
responses in both oral mucosa and intestinal mucosa; this
phenomenon can be designated OIAS.

Gal1 inhibits OIAS
During the sensitization period, mice were
treated with or without Gal1. The results showed that
administration of Gal1 inhibited OIAS (Figure 1).

fraction in the immune regulation [11], we hypothesized
that the immunization of mice with antigen PE might
affect IL-10+ CD14+ cells. Thus, we assessed IL-10+
CD14+ cells in the LPMCs of allergic mice. The results
showed that the frequency of IL-10+ CD14+ cells was
about 5.17% in LPMCs of control mice, which was only
1.12% in allergic mice. In the mice treated with both PE
and Gal1, however, the frequency of IL-10+ CD14+ cells
in LPMCs was about 7.13%. The results indicate that Gal1
promoted the development of IL-10+ CD14+ cells in the
mouse intestine (Figure 2).

isolated from LPMCs of allergic mice; the results showed
a positive correlation (Figure 4A). The data implicate that
IL-4 may enhance the expression of miR-98 in CD14+
cells. To test this, we isolated CD14+ cells from naive
mouse intestine and stimulated with IL-4 in the culture
for 48 h. The results showed that IL-4 did enhance
the expression of miR-98 in CD14+ cells in an IL-4
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4B).

Gal1 suppresses miR-98 in CD14+ cells
We then tested the role of Gal1 in the regulation of
miR-98 expression in CD14+ cells. CD14+ cells were
isolated from the LPMCs of allergic mice. The cells
expressed high levels of miR-98. The allergy mousederived CD14+ cells were treated with Gal1 in the culture
for 48 h. Indeed, Gal1 inhibited the levels of miR-98 in
CD14+ cells (Figure 4C).

CD14+ cells from allergic mice express higher
levels of miR-98 and lower levels of IL-10
Published data indicate that miR-98 suppresses the
expression of IL-10 [8]. Since the frequency of IL-10+ B
cells was lower in CD14+ cells of allergic mice as shown
by Figure 2, we inferred that the expression of miR-98
might be higher in the CD14+ cells of allergic mice. To test
this, we isolated CD14+ cells from LPMCs and analyzed
by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The results showed
that the levels of miR-98 were detectable in CD14+ cells
of naive control mice, which was significantly enhanced
in allergic mice. Treating mice with both Gal1 and PE,
or Gal1 alone did not increase the expression of miR-98
in CD14+ cells (Figure 3A). On the other hand, the IL10 levels in the CD14+ cells were markedly lower in the
sensitized mice at both mRNA levels and protein levels
(Figure 3B–3C). A correlation test was performed with
the data of miR-98 and IL-10 mRNA in CD14+ cells. The
results showed a negative correlation between miR-98 and
IL-10 expression in CD14+ cells (Figure 3D), suggesting
miR-98 might interfere with the expression of IL-10.

Gal1 reverses the ability of IL-10 expression in
CD14+ cells
We then tested if Gal1 reversed the ability of IL10 expression in allergy mouse-derived CD14+ cells. The
cells were exposed to Gal1 and LPS (a stimulator of IL-10
expression) in the culture for 48 h. The results showed that
the expression of IL-10 was increased in an Gal1 dosedependent manner (Figure 4D).

CD45 mediates the effects of Gal1 on modulating
the expression of IL-10 and miR-98 in CD14+
cells
Since CD45 is the receptor of Gal1 [12], we next
assessed if CD45 mediates the effects of Gal1 in the
regulation of the expression of IL-10 and miR-98 in
CD14+ cells. Firstly we prepared the CD45-deficient
CD14+ cells by transducing the CD45 shRNA-carrying
lentivirus or non-specific shRNA-carrying virus (Figure

4E). CD14+ cells were processed as described in Figure
4C and Figure 4D. The results showed that the CD45deficient CD14+ cells did not respond the stimuli of
Gal1 (Figure 4C–4D), indicating that Gal1 modulates
the expression of miR-98 and IL-10 in CD14+ cells via
ligating CD45.

cells (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary
Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
The present data show the oral-intestinal allergy
syndrome (OIAS) in mice. By immunizing mice via
applying antigens to the buccal mucosa and re-challenging
mice with specific antigens, mice showed systemic allergic
responses and allergic responses in the buccal mucosa and
intestinal mucosa. Lower frequency of IL-10+ CD14+
cells was detected in mice with the OIAS. CD14+ cells
from the intestinal mucosa of OIAS mice showed lower
levels of IL-10 expression and higher levels of miR-98;
the latter could be up regulated by exposure to IL-4 in
the culture. Administration with Gal1 suppressed the

IL-10+ CD14+ cells inhibit oral-intestinal
syndrome
Data reported above implicate the IL-10+ CD14+
cells may have immune regulatory functions on the oralintestinal syndrome. To test this, we generated IL-10+
CD14+ cells to be adoptively transferred into mice during
the period of sensitization. Indeed, the oral-intestinal
allergy syndrome was abolished by the IL-10+ CD14+

expression of miR-98 in CD14+ cells and inhibited the
OIAS in mice. The allergic response in the oral mucosa of
the OIAS mice is that heavy infiltration of mast cells and
eosinophils were observed in the oral mucosa.
The oral allergy syndrome was reported a long time
ago [1]. Because it can occur together with hay fever,
a link between the oral allergy syndrome and pollen
sensitization was proposed [13]. The present data revealed
another aspect of the oral allergy syndrome that also can
occur together with intestinal allergy.
The data also showed that lower levels of IL-10
expression in the intestine-isolated CD14+ cells. IL-10
is a cytokine possesses important immune regulatory
functions. The IL-10 deficiency has been reported in a
number of immune disorders. Such as asthma patients
showed lower serum levels of IL-10, which positively
correlated with the lung function [14]. The serum IL-10
levels in atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome children were
markedly lower than that in healthy controls [15]. Our
data are in line with those previous reports by showing the
frequency of IL-10+ CD14+ cell was lower in OIAS mice
than that in control mice.
The mechanism underlying the suppression of IL10 is not clear. A recent report indicated that miR-98
suppressed the expression of IL-10 in macrophages. The
authors found that miR-98 targeted the 3'untranslated
region of the IL-10 transcript. Overexpression of miR-98
inhibited LPS-induced IL-10 expression [8]. The present
data demonstrate that miR-98 expression was enhanced in
CD14+ cells of OIAS mice and negatively correlated with
the expression of IL-10.
The data show that Gal1 can inhibit the PE-induced
OIAS. The underlying mechanism may be because Gal1
has multiple biological functions. It is known that Gal1
has the immune suppression functions [9]. By promoting
the secretion of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, epidermal
growth factor, IL-10, IL-25, and transforming growth
factor-β1 by intestinal epithelial cells, Gal1 can inhibit
experimental intestinal inflammation [16]. It induces IL-10
expression in dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells to facilitate
the generation of immune regulatory cells [17]. Gal1 is
also involved in maintaining the homeostasis in the eye
[18]. Our results have expanded the existing knowledge
in the study of Gal1 by showing that Gal1 can inhibit the
OIAS in mice.
The data show that the frequency of IL-10+ CD14+
cell in the intestine was less in the OIAS mice as compared
to naïve mice. Our previous work also found that IL-10producing B cells were less in the intestine of mice with
food allergy [19, 20]. Clinical study indicates that IL-10
gene polymorphism is associated with food allergy and
lower serum IL-10 levels [21]. Others also found that
the myeloid-derived monocytes express IL-10, which
suppresses most immune effector cells [22]. Because IL10 is an anti-inflammation cytokine; it suppresses allergic
responses [23], in which IL-10 inhibits the expression of
the high affinity IgE receptor via the signal transducer and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activator of transcription (STAT)-3. IL-10 also diminishes
IgE-induced response by inhibiting expression of the
signaling molecules Syk, Fyn, Akt, and STAT5 [24]. the
finding of decrease in IL-10+ CD14+ cells in the intestine
may be responsible, at least in part, in the pathogenesis
of OIAS. The reasoning is supported by the subsequent
data. By adoptive transfer with IL-10+ CD14+ cells, the
symptoms of OIAS were efficiently inhibited in the mice
as shown by the present data. Other also found that IL-10producing B cells down regulated inflammation in airway
hyper-responsiveness [25].
'In summary, the present data show that
immunization at the oral mucosa induced OIAS in mice
via suppressing IL-10 expression in CD14+ cells in the
intestine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and ethic statement
Male BALB/c mice were purchased from the
Guangdong Experimental Animal Center. The mice were
maintained in a pathogen-free environment with accessing
food and water freely. The experimental procedures
were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at
Shenzhen University. The experiments were performed in
accordance with the approved guidelines.

Preparation of peanut antigens
Peanut proteins were extracted from crude peanut
according to previously reported procedures [26, 27]. The
peanut extracts (PE) were used as a specific antigen in the
present study.

Sensitization of mice and treatment with Gal1
A sensitization mixture was made of PE and cholera
toxin at a ratio of 10:1 (W/W), or PE/Gal1 and cholera
toxin at a ratio of 10:10:1 (W/W/W). Mice were under
light anesthesia by inspiration of ethyl; the sensitization
mixture (soaked in a cotton ball), or Gal1 alone, was
applied to the buccal mucosa of both sides, three times
a day for 14 consecutive days. Caution was taken to
avoid the antigen swallowing down the digestive tract by
optimizing the amounts of the sensitization mixture in the
cotton ball.

Challenging mice with PE and sample collection
On day 15, the mice were challenged with PE (5
mg/mouse) in 0.3 ml saline via gavage-feeding as well as
applied to the buccal mucosa. The core temperature was
recorded from each mouse 30 min after the challenge. The
mice were sacrificed 4 h later. The blood samples, buccal
mucosa and small intestine were collected for further
experiments.

labeled antibodies or isotype IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. After
washing with PBS, the cells were analyzed with a flow
cytometer (FACSCanto II, BD Bioscience). The data were
analyzed by software flowjo. Data from the isotype IgG
staining were used as a gating reference.

The blood samples were collected from each
mouse at the sacrifice. The sera were isolated from
the blood by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C until
use. The histamine levels were determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a reagent kit
(Biocompare) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The serum levels of PE-specific IgE were assessed by
an in-house ELISA with the reagents purchased from
Abcam. Briefly, the 96-well microplates were coated
with PE (20 μg/ml) in carbonate buffer (0.05 M, pH 9.6)
overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked by incubating
with 5% skim milk for 30 min at 37 °C. The serum
samples (diluted 10 folds) or isotype IgG was added
to the wells (0.1 ml/well; in triplicate) and incubated
overnight at 4 °C; followed by adding anti-IgE antibodies
or isotype IgG and incubated overnight at 4 °C; the
second antibodies (labeled with peroxidase) were added
and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Washing with
PBS was performed after each time of incubation. The
plates were developed with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
substrate (Sigma Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The reaction was stopped by adding 2M
H2SO4. The plates were read in a microplate reader
(BioTek, Shanghai, China) at 450 nm. The readouts from
wells of isotype IgG were regarded background and were
subtracted from each sample well.

Real time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
The levels of IL-10 mRNA and miR-98 were
assessed by RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from
cells with the TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). The cDNA
was synthesized with the RNA and a reverse transcription
kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in a real time PCR
device (MiniOpticon, Bio-Rad) with the SYBR Green
Master Mix (Invitrogen). The results were normalized to
fold change against the internal control gene β-actin. The
primers of IL-10 and miR-98 were provided by the Enke
Biotech (Shenzhen, China).

Western blotting
The total proteins were extracted from cells,
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto
a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After
blocking with 5% skim milk at room temperature for
30 min, the membrane was stained with the primary
antibodies or isotype IgG overnight at 4 °C, washed
with PBS, followed by incubation with peroxidaselabeled second antibodies for 1 h at room temperature,
washed with PBS again. The blots on the membrane
were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence and
photographed. The antibodies used in Western blotting
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz,
CA).

Mast cell and eosinophil counts in the oral
mucosa and intestinal mucosa
Immediately after the sacrifice, the buccal mucosa
and a segment of the jejunum were excised and fixed
with 4% formalin overnight. The tissue was processed
for paraffin sections. The sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin, or 0.5% toluidine blue. Mast cells
and eosinophils in the sections were counted under a light
microscope; 20 randomly selected fields were counted for
each mouse. All the slides were coded. The observers were
not aware of the code to avoid the observer bias.

RNA interference (RNAi)
CD14+ cells were isolated from LPMC by magnetic
cells sorting (MACS) with specific reagent kit purchased
from Miltenyi Biotech (San Diego, CA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The CD14+ cells were
transduced with the CD45 shRNA-carrying lentivirus
or non-specific shRNA-carrying lentivirus (Santa Cruz
Biotech; Santa Cruz, CA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The effects of the RNAi were assessed by
Western blotting.

Assessment of serum IL-4 levels by ELISA
The serum levels of IL-4 were determined by
ELISA with a reagent kit (R&D Systems) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis

Flow cytometry

Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
from at least three independent experiments. The
difference between groups was analyzed by Student’s
t-test (unpaired t-test, two-tailed) or by two-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni correction. The correlation test
was performed with software Prism GraphPad. p <0.05
was considered significant.

For the surface staining, cells were stained with
fluorochrome-labeled antibodies or isotype IgG for 30
min at 4 °C. If the intracellular staining was required,
the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h,
and permeated by incubation with 0.5% saponin for 30
min; the cells were then incubated with fluorochromewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
